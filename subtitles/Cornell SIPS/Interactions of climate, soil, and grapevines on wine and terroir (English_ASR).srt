00:00:00,919 --> 00:00:04,560
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:11,798
University okay thank you thank you Alan

3
00:00:10,039 --> 00:00:13,518
thank you Don for inviting me it's a

4
00:00:11,798 --> 00:00:15,359
pleasure to be here hello everybody

5
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:20,079
hello people in Geneva for connected

6
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:22,160
with us um so my talk is about terar so

7
00:00:20,079 --> 00:00:23,799
um a few people a lot of people think

8
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:27,560
that terar is a

9
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:30,240
myth um so is it myth or

10
00:00:27,559 --> 00:00:32,079
reality and we're going to try to Give a

11
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:34,159
definition of terar which is not easy

12
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:35,719
because terar is quite complex and there

13
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:37,878
are many different factors dealing with

14
00:00:35,719 --> 00:00:40,239
terar and we're going to see that terar

15
00:00:37,878 --> 00:00:42,119
is all about interactions interactions

16
00:00:40,238 --> 00:00:43,640
between the vine and the environment the

17
00:00:42,119 --> 00:00:46,439
vine and the climate and the vine and

18
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:48,679
the soil and we can extract some key

19
00:00:46,439 --> 00:00:52,159
factors dealing with terar and try how

20
00:00:48,679 --> 00:00:55,039
we can measure them and quantify them um

21
00:00:52,159 --> 00:00:56,759
terar also has a special component terar

22
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:59,160
is about origin and origin has a

23
00:00:56,759 --> 00:01:00,920
boundary and there can be variability so

24
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:03,518
spatial variability is very important

25
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:04,920
when you're doing research on terar and

26
00:01:03,518 --> 00:01:07,039
once you know all this well then you

27
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:10,320
will see that it's not so difficult to

28
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:12,600
optimize terar expression and manage

29
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:16,279
terar so we're first going to look at if

30
00:01:12,599 --> 00:01:19,359
terar is reality or myth so there quite

31
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:22,118
a I will just uh show a few statements

32
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:24,920
on terar that some people made uh some

33
00:01:22,118 --> 00:01:27,438
people think that terar is a religion

34
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:30,118
you're either a Believer or you're not

35
00:01:27,438 --> 00:01:31,599
you cannot prove it

36
00:01:30,118 --> 00:01:33,840
another statement which you read very

37
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:35,879
much in popular books about wine growing

38
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:39,719
not necessarily scientific books but

39
00:01:35,879 --> 00:01:43,759
most uh popular books about vne growing

40
00:01:39,719 --> 00:01:45,879
uh state that terar is about old Vines

41
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:47,439
extending Deep Roots into deep layers

42
00:01:45,879 --> 00:01:49,959
and the vines pick up minerals from

43
00:01:47,438 --> 00:01:52,679
deeper layers which by some mystery are

44
00:01:49,959 --> 00:01:55,078
transformed into into Aromas which giv

45
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:57,280
the minerality to the wine so wine grown

46
00:01:55,078 --> 00:02:00,519
on slate should smell like

47
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:02,879
slate that's another myth

48
00:02:00,519 --> 00:02:05,078
um some Growers particularly in the in

49
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:06,640
the new world believe that terar is

50
00:02:05,078 --> 00:02:08,199
protectionism from those who believe

51
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,560
that they have and of course those are

52
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:13,560
the old world Growers against those who

53
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:16,640
are supposed to have not well both are

54
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:18,239
wrong um old world producers are wrong

55
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:20,238
to believe that they're the only ones to

56
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:23,920
have terar because if terar is about

57
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:27,159
origin a new world wine also have an

58
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:29,199
origin and um New World producers I

59
00:02:27,159 --> 00:02:31,878
believe that they are wrong that terar

60
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:34,518
is just prodiction ISM of European

61
00:02:31,878 --> 00:02:37,199
Growers now the nicest one I've heard

62
00:02:34,519 --> 00:02:39,599
and it was a very serious one um this is

63
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:41,959
from um an Australian researcher who's

64
00:02:39,598 --> 00:02:43,878
called Peter dry he's doing research on

65
00:02:41,959 --> 00:02:46,280
irrigation that's why his name is Peter

66
00:02:43,878 --> 00:02:48,000
dry and in a conference something like

67
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:50,439
10 years ago I asked him what he thought

68
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,080
about terar and he said well terar

69
00:02:50,439 --> 00:02:53,079
that's just

70
00:02:53,680 --> 00:03:00,000
okay so um of course my purpose

71
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:03,280
is to make you a Believer and so I take

72
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,039
you to to burgundy to turn you into a

73
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:07,878
Believer um if you want to know if terar

74
00:03:06,039 --> 00:03:09,598
is a reality or not and I should have

75
00:03:07,878 --> 00:03:12,000
done this with Peter dry but I just had

76
00:03:09,598 --> 00:03:14,119
the time to take him there but one day I

77
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,479
will uh if you're not a believer in

78
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:19,120
terad you just have to go to burgundy

79
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:21,238
for historical reasons in burgundy uh

80
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,799
The Growers owe plots over different

81
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:25,519
Villages different appellations in

82
00:03:22,799 --> 00:03:27,200
different locations on the hill and they

83
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:28,879
basically grow all their bards in

84
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:30,719
exactly the same way they all have high

85
00:03:28,878 --> 00:03:33,798
density plantations 10,000 Vines per

86
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:36,000
hectare vertical shoot positioning Pinon

87
00:03:33,799 --> 00:03:38,920
for red Chardon for white same root

88
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,639
stock everywhere and uh they just all

89
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:43,479
the The Vineyards are trained in the

90
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:45,438
same way and uh they make the wine also

91
00:03:43,479 --> 00:03:47,919
in the same way they just put the grapes

92
00:03:45,438 --> 00:03:49,919
into uh open top fermentor and punch

93
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:52,318
down the skins with their feet be it

94
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:54,598
basic burgundy or a grung crew and then

95
00:03:52,318 --> 00:03:58,518
in the end they turn out to have 10 or

96
00:03:54,598 --> 00:04:00,878
12 or 15 different wines ranging from 5

97
00:03:58,519 --> 00:04:03,039
a bottle to 10 T of euros and sometimes

98
00:04:00,878 --> 00:04:05,560
hundreds of Euros a bottle and and it's

99
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:06,840
just because those blocks are located

100
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:08,640
different parts of the slopes in

101
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:11,239
different Villages that the wines are so

102
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:13,158
different and and then you go into the

103
00:04:11,239 --> 00:04:14,560
Celler and you taste these wines and

104
00:04:13,158 --> 00:04:16,478
then you have to be a believer because

105
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,720
these wines are so different that there

106
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:20,519
is something about the origin which

107
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,199
makes the the wine taste different

108
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:24,560
depending on the place where it comes

109
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:30,240
from but of course this is not science

110
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:33,160
this is just um um experiment

111
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:36,360
experience um there are also a few

112
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:38,240
examples from New World places where

113
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:41,800
without going into science you can see

114
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:44,879
that terar is reality and probably the

115
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:47,360
first uh terar rine from the new world

116
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:49,038
was made in California uh and it's

117
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:51,080
called Marta's

118
00:04:49,038 --> 00:04:53,120
Vineyard uh maybe you know this wine

119
00:04:51,079 --> 00:04:54,800
it's one of the the top wines from from

120
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,639
NEPA Valley which is grown by The

121
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,600
Heights family and the heights family

122
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:00,840
they made a very good cabano they had

123
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:02,639
their own Vineyard and were buying

124
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:05,159
purchasing grapes from other Growers and

125
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:07,038
they made a bland a good cabanon Bland

126
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:10,360
which was quite famous in the late 1960s

127
00:05:07,038 --> 00:05:13,800
or early 1970s and then they owned two

128
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:15,720
blocks and one was called uh um Marta's

129
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:17,560
Vineyard and the wine maker every year

130
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:19,840
said well the wine from this block is so

131
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:22,720
good it's a Pity to blend it in the into

132
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:24,079
the caban BL why shouldn't we bottle it

133
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:26,080
separately and sell it for a higher

134
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:27,399
price and of course the salespeople were

135
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:28,959
completely agreed they said this is

136
00:05:27,399 --> 00:05:32,359
great because then we have a top wine

137
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:34,638
and we limited uh number of bottles and

138
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:35,919
we can sell it for a higher price and so

139
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:37,439
they started to make wine from this

140
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:40,839
particular block and that's exactly what

141
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:42,519
the terar wine is specified origin uh

142
00:05:40,839 --> 00:05:45,198
with specific conditions of soil and

143
00:05:42,519 --> 00:05:48,120
climate so Martz Vineyard was the first

144
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:49,720
wine terar wi from the new world and and

145
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:51,439
when they made that I don't know if it

146
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:52,319
was whether it was in the late 60s or

147
00:05:51,439 --> 00:05:54,560
the early

148
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:55,960
1970s they they well they they didn't

149
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:59,319
realize that they were making a terar

150
00:05:55,959 --> 00:06:01,079
wine and what is very often the case

151
00:05:59,319 --> 00:06:03,000
which be it in the new world or in the

152
00:06:01,079 --> 00:06:05,439
old world if people make terar wine it's

153
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,478
just to make more profit because if you

154
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:09,038
make wine from specific locations and

155
00:06:07,478 --> 00:06:11,639
your wine is something special you can

156
00:06:09,038 --> 00:06:13,800
sell it for a higher price uh that's the

157
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:17,000
good way to deal with terar so people

158
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:19,319
make terar wines just to make more

159
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,478
money and there was no science involved

160
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:22,039
there were no scientists going to

161
00:06:20,478 --> 00:06:23,639
Marta's Vineyard and tell the owners

162
00:06:22,038 --> 00:06:26,120
that there was something special science

163
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:28,478
generally comes afterwards to explain

164
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:30,720
why in some places the wine is different

165
00:06:28,478 --> 00:06:32,758
and the wine is better and this of

166
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,639
course I went on pilgrimage to Mar's

167
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:38,080
Vineyard a few years ago and I took this

168
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:38,079
nice picture beautiful

169
00:06:38,478 --> 00:06:45,240
Vineyard so um when terar is reality we

170
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:47,919
should be able to make a definition of

171
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:51,439
ter now many many people try to give

172
00:06:47,918 --> 00:06:55,439
aition definition of terar but it's not

173
00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:58,560
easy um because generally if you try to

174
00:06:55,439 --> 00:07:01,319
make a definition of terar based on one

175
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:04,360
discipline the definition is not very

176
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:05,680
good um and a lot of people tried to

177
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:07,960
make a definition from their own

178
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:11,400
discipline geologist and don't know if

179
00:07:07,959 --> 00:07:14,000
you know this book terar by geologist an

180
00:07:11,399 --> 00:07:16,279
American geologist who is called Wilson

181
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,079
James Wilson and the book is very nice

182
00:07:16,279 --> 00:07:19,799
it's about the geology of wine growing

183
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:21,478
regions there's just one thing which is

184
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:23,680
wrong with this book is the title

185
00:07:21,478 --> 00:07:27,399
because it's not about terar it's about

186
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:30,280
geology and GE geographers also tried to

187
00:07:27,399 --> 00:07:33,598
Define terar based on geomorphology me

188
00:07:30,279 --> 00:07:36,119
the slopes or um that make the the

189
00:07:33,598 --> 00:07:38,598
what's special in in wine s scientists

190
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:40,959
Drew up very nice s maps and then called

191
00:07:38,598 --> 00:07:44,639
it terar Maps but those are s Maps those

192
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:48,279
are not terar maps climatologists try to

193
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:50,759
Define climate zones for growing

194
00:07:48,279 --> 00:07:53,679
specific wine types and try to Define

195
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:55,520
terar from a climatologist point of view

196
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:59,680
but they talk about climatology and not

197
00:07:55,519 --> 00:08:02,758
about terar there's a famous French saw

198
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:05,439
a microb bi biologist which is called CL

199
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:07,840
Bon and he thinks he deals with terar

200
00:08:05,439 --> 00:08:11,560
but in fact he's he's studying soil

201
00:08:07,839 --> 00:08:13,079
microbiology and not Tera and well

202
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:15,639
there's nothing wrong with all these

203
00:08:13,079 --> 00:08:18,560
approaches but they are not really about

204
00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:22,478
Tera they're dealing with some specific

205
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:24,439
factors um dealing with Tera and in fact

206
00:08:22,478 --> 00:08:27,000
the most important thing these people

207
00:08:24,439 --> 00:08:30,478
forget is that the the vine should

208
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:35,000
always be in the center of a terar

209
00:08:30,478 --> 00:08:38,838
study um you cannot explain ter just

210
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:41,158
by geology or soil types or soil

211
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:43,399
microbiology or climatic zones you have

212
00:08:41,158 --> 00:08:46,200
to integrate the vine and see how the

213
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:48,039
vine interact with the environment and a

214
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:51,920
few years ago I assisted to a a

215
00:08:48,039 --> 00:08:54,278
conference and there was a um geographer

216
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:56,039
from New Zealand speaking Warren Moran

217
00:08:54,278 --> 00:08:58,000
and he had a statement which I liked

218
00:08:56,039 --> 00:09:00,159
very very much he said we are all

219
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,320
victims of our own discipline and all

220
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:04,078
these guys they are a little bit victim

221
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:07,360
of their own

222
00:09:04,078 --> 00:09:09,599
discipline and terar is PL

223
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:11,839
disciplinary um a definition I like very

224
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,560
much about terar is a very simple one

225
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:15,440
terar is a sense of place I don't

226
00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:18,159
remember where I heard that but I I like

227
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:19,560
it very much if you taste the wine and

228
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:22,759
there is something special about that

229
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:24,599
place then it's a terar wine a more

230
00:09:22,759 --> 00:09:26,879
complete definition was given by

231
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:28,720
Professor sugan from Bordeaux who was

232
00:09:26,879 --> 00:09:31,039
probably the first one in the world to

233
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:33,440
study ser viously terar on a scientific

234
00:09:31,039 --> 00:09:35,639
basis and he defined terar as an

235
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:38,959
interactive cultivated ecosystem in a

236
00:09:35,639 --> 00:09:41,439
given place including climate soil and

237
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:45,000
the vine and I like very much the idea

238
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:46,440
of an ecosystem an ecosystem is a is a

239
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,200
living beings interacting with their

240
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:51,839
environment and in our situation it's

241
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:54,278
the the vine interacting with it with

242
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:57,200
its environment and of course human

243
00:09:54,278 --> 00:09:59,399
factors are involved because it's not a

244
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:02,519
natural system it's a cultivated system

245
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:04,958
so man takes management choices which

246
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:07,679
impact of course on the final result and

247
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:09,879
so the human factor is also very

248
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:12,759
important and this human factor has an

249
00:10:09,879 --> 00:10:14,720
historical Dimension because generally

250
00:10:12,759 --> 00:10:16,958
people figured out what are the right

251
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:18,519
varieties in their climatic situation on

252
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:20,518
their soils which are the right root

253
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:24,360
stocks which are the right training

254
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:26,440
systems by trial and error so sometimes

255
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:28,680
old wine growing regions can have some

256
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:30,720
advantage in terms of Tera not because

257
00:10:28,679 --> 00:10:33,399
they have more ter ter but they have a

258
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:36,278
little bit more experience in um

259
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:36,278
managing their

260
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:42,159
terar science generally explains terar

261
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:43,958
but only afterwards it's very rare that

262
00:10:42,159 --> 00:10:46,039
scientists go into the field and say you

263
00:10:43,958 --> 00:10:47,559
should plant vines there because there's

264
00:10:46,039 --> 00:10:50,639
something special in the soil in the

265
00:10:47,559 --> 00:10:53,119
climate that will make a great terar

266
00:10:50,639 --> 00:10:56,320
wi where science also can help is to

267
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:58,078
optimize terar expression once you know

268
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:00,519
all the factors that are important in

269
00:10:58,078 --> 00:11:03,039
terar expression then science can help

270
00:11:00,519 --> 00:11:05,078
to optimize the terar expression by

271
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:08,439
specific management practices and we

272
00:11:05,078 --> 00:11:11,879
will talk about that so as as I told you

273
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:14,839
that terar is about interactions and we

274
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:16,559
can extract among all these interactions

275
00:11:14,839 --> 00:11:18,760
some which are more important than

276
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:22,039
others in the final

277
00:11:18,759 --> 00:11:24,399
result um for this talk I extracted

278
00:11:22,039 --> 00:11:27,838
three which I think are really uh sort

279
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:30,720
of pillars in terar expression the first

280
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:33,040
one is the timing of phology which

281
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:36,000
depends on the climate of course the the

282
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:38,159
warmer the climate earlier the the the

283
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,759
phology but depends also on your soil

284
00:11:38,159 --> 00:11:41,919
type you can have warm soils or cool

285
00:11:39,759 --> 00:11:44,399
soils and on the vine in particular on

286
00:11:41,919 --> 00:11:47,319
the Great Vine variety a second pillar

287
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:49,519
in ter expression is water status and in

288
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:51,079
water status water stat is about the

289
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:54,519
interaction between the vine and the

290
00:11:51,078 --> 00:11:57,759
climate rainfall uh EV po transpiration

291
00:11:54,519 --> 00:11:59,879
but also between the vine and the soil

292
00:11:57,759 --> 00:12:01,919
and uh among mineral that the vines are

293
00:11:59,879 --> 00:12:04,559
picking up from the soil nitrogen is

294
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:07,479
probably the most important one because

295
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:11,239
it it affects very much Vigor and and

296
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:13,839
yield and also compounds in in grapes so

297
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:17,159
first let's have a look at the timing of

298
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:18,920
U phology when you try to it's obvious

299
00:12:17,159 --> 00:12:21,919
that climate is an important factor in

300
00:12:18,919 --> 00:12:24,319
terar expression but if you try to

301
00:12:21,919 --> 00:12:26,559
define the ideal climate for grape

302
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:29,000
growing it's just impossible we cannot

303
00:12:26,559 --> 00:12:31,799
give the optimum temperature range of of

304
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:34,799
or the optimum amount of rainfall to

305
00:12:31,799 --> 00:12:36,679
grow a high quality wine simply if you

306
00:12:34,799 --> 00:12:38,559
look at where great wines are grown in

307
00:12:36,679 --> 00:12:40,479
the world they they are grown at

308
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:42,319
different places with different climatic

309
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:45,680
conditions great wines are obviously

310
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:47,399
made in Bordeaux uh but also in burgundy

311
00:12:45,679 --> 00:12:49,319
where the climate is much cooler and

312
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:52,240
also in California where the climate is

313
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:54,720
much warmer so there does not seem to be

314
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:56,480
an Optimum temperature range for growing

315
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:59,759
high quality wine so if you look at the

316
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:02,839
climate alone it's impossible to Define

317
00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:05,278
the ideal climate conditions for growing

318
00:13:02,839 --> 00:13:07,160
great wines and in fact what's what's

319
00:13:05,278 --> 00:13:09,639
important is the interactions are the

320
00:13:07,159 --> 00:13:11,198
interactions between the climate and the

321
00:13:09,639 --> 00:13:15,320
grap Vine so once again we have to put

322
00:13:11,198 --> 00:13:18,639
the Grapevine back in the center of the

323
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:21,519
system um this is a statement made by

324
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:23,360
two famous Bordeaux enologists which

325
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:26,278
were the directors of the faculty of

326
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:28,000
enology in the 1950s in 1960s in

327
00:13:26,278 --> 00:13:31,000
Bordeaux and can be these people can be

328
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:33,879
considered as the founders of the modern

329
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:37,600
of the enology School of Bordeaux je

330
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:40,559
rayon and Emil poo and in their handbook

331
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:43,639
about um enology I extracted this

332
00:13:40,559 --> 00:13:45,319
sentence they wrote in the 1960 that in

333
00:13:43,639 --> 00:13:47,720
a given region the best wines are

334
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:50,480
obtained from fine grap Vine varieties

335
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:52,680
that just aeve achieve full ripeness

336
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:54,399
under the local climatic conditions as

337
00:13:52,679 --> 00:13:56,120
if a quick ripening would burn the

338
00:13:54,399 --> 00:14:00,159
flavors that account for the Finesse of

339
00:13:56,120 --> 00:14:03,480
great wines now if you translate that in

340
00:14:00,159 --> 00:14:05,198
um a little bit more modern language uh

341
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:07,320
you can say that of course to make high

342
00:14:05,198 --> 00:14:09,120
quality wines grapes must attain full

343
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:11,120
ripeness that's easy to understand you

344
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:13,000
cannot make great wines with unripened

345
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:15,000
grapes you would have green flavors too

346
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,278
much acidity and too low sugar in the

347
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,600
grapes but on the other hand it's very

348
00:14:17,278 --> 00:14:22,198
important also to consider that grapes

349
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:24,360
should not ripen too early in the season

350
00:14:22,198 --> 00:14:26,198
because if you ripen the fruit very

351
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:28,399
quickly in warm conditions say for

352
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:30,000
instance in July or in August then it's

353
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:31,759
just like growing tomatoes in green

354
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,799
houses there will be no flavor there

355
00:14:31,759 --> 00:14:36,600
will be a lot of sugar the wines will be

356
00:14:33,799 --> 00:14:38,559
lacking acid so the W The Grapes will be

357
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:40,560
lacking acid so the wines will lack

358
00:14:38,559 --> 00:14:42,559
freshness but particularly there will be

359
00:14:40,559 --> 00:14:44,559
very little Aromas you get much more

360
00:14:42,559 --> 00:14:46,359
Aromas if the end of the ripening is

361
00:14:44,559 --> 00:14:49,198
happening at the end of the season in

362
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:51,959
cool conditions so the timing of the

363
00:14:49,198 --> 00:14:54,278
ripeness is very very important in terar

364
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:56,319
expression should not be too early

365
00:14:54,278 --> 00:14:58,559
neither too late in the season and on

366
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:01,160
the Northern Hemisphere more or less the

367
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:02,518
right window for ripening grapes is

368
00:15:01,159 --> 00:15:04,799
between the 10th of September and the

369
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:06,198
10th of October if you after that

370
00:15:04,799 --> 00:15:08,000
there's a big risk that your grapes will

371
00:15:06,198 --> 00:15:11,439
never ripen and you will have green

372
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:14,519
flavor in your wine if you ripen much

373
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:16,240
earlier say in August then um your

374
00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:19,240
grapes would dpen very quickly and your

375
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:22,519
grapes would lack Aromas so that

376
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:25,120
ripening window is very important now if

377
00:15:22,519 --> 00:15:27,679
you look at European appellations in

378
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:29,720
European appellations people Define the

379
00:15:27,679 --> 00:15:31,799
grap Vine varieties they can grow if you

380
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:33,680
are in Bordeaux you cannot grow any grap

381
00:15:31,799 --> 00:15:36,559
Vine variety you restrict to a list of

382
00:15:33,679 --> 00:15:38,479
seven or or eight varieties and you go

383
00:15:36,559 --> 00:15:41,559
to burgundy it's even more restricted

384
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:45,039
you go to Tusan it's also restricted and

385
00:15:41,559 --> 00:15:47,000
why are these um varieties so restricted

386
00:15:45,039 --> 00:15:48,879
just because by trial and error people

387
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:52,318
have figured out which varieties in

388
00:15:48,879 --> 00:15:54,039
their condition ripen in the right uh uh

389
00:15:52,318 --> 00:15:56,078
temperature window and that makes that

390
00:15:54,039 --> 00:15:57,719
in Europe Harvest is always between the

391
00:15:56,078 --> 00:15:59,439
10th of September and the T of October

392
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:01,759
where you go to

393
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:05,920
to De mooso to Alas to burgundy to

394
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:08,240
Bordeaux to laa to tesan up to up South

395
00:16:05,919 --> 00:16:11,078
to Al where they grow a very late

396
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:13,240
ripening variety which is called monast

397
00:16:11,078 --> 00:16:15,679
Harvest is always in that right ripening

398
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:17,318
window if you grow Pon Noir in Bordeaux

399
00:16:15,679 --> 00:16:19,399
then Baux is no longer a great terar

400
00:16:17,318 --> 00:16:21,519
because P would R it in August if you

401
00:16:19,399 --> 00:16:23,078
grow cabano in burgundy burgundy is no

402
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:26,198
longer a great terar because your

403
00:16:23,078 --> 00:16:27,799
cabinet so will never ripen so that Ade

404
00:16:26,198 --> 00:16:30,039
equation between the timing of your

405
00:16:27,799 --> 00:16:32,838
variety and your climate conditions is

406
00:16:30,039 --> 00:16:36,240
very important to grow terar

407
00:16:32,839 --> 00:16:38,560
wines now of course um there not all

408
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:40,480
Wines in the world are terar wines

409
00:16:38,559 --> 00:16:42,719
people can also make varietal wines and

410
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:45,039
not dealing with the origin but focusing

411
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:46,839
on the grae vne variety and that

412
00:16:45,039 --> 00:16:49,639
generally happens when people are

413
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:50,920
planting grapes in new wine growing

414
00:16:49,639 --> 00:16:52,879
regions where they don't have a lot of

415
00:16:50,919 --> 00:16:54,559
experience they say okay we like

416
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:56,958
burgundy wines white burgundies are made

417
00:16:54,559 --> 00:16:58,439
with chardonay so let's plant chardonay

418
00:16:56,958 --> 00:16:59,559
but they don't look at the climatic

419
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:02,680
conditions if they are similar to

420
00:16:59,559 --> 00:17:07,159
burgundy and if Chardon is the right

421
00:17:02,679 --> 00:17:09,720
choice and in many um new wine growing

422
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:12,160
regions people plant rather early

423
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:13,798
ripening varieties in warm conditions

424
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:16,160
this is the case in the south of

425
00:17:13,798 --> 00:17:18,359
Australia this is the case was the case

426
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:20,519
in California in in Napa when they

427
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:24,399
replanted a lot in the 1970s they

428
00:17:20,519 --> 00:17:26,078
planted a lot of chardonay and um then

429
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:29,440
the chardonay will ripen in those

430
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:33,119
regions in or ponir Chardon ripen in

431
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:34,720
August and then the grapes lack flavor

432
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:36,879
you still can make good wine but then

433
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:39,319
you need a lot of Technology if you

434
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:41,160
ferment the chardonay in Oak barrels you

435
00:17:39,319 --> 00:17:43,678
let them age on the leaves you make a

436
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:45,640
mctic fermentation have some nice detil

437
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:47,400
produced by the mctic fermentation then

438
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:48,960
you get flavor in your wine but it's not

439
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:50,519
the flavor from the Chardon grapes it's

440
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:52,400
the flavor from your technological

441
00:17:50,519 --> 00:17:54,359
transformation and then you're no longer

442
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:57,159
making terar vnes you're

443
00:17:54,359 --> 00:17:59,279
making Vines more based on technology

444
00:17:57,159 --> 00:18:01,840
which can be sound wines good wines but

445
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:05,359
they are not ter

446
00:18:01,839 --> 00:18:08,599
wines um if you really want to to to

447
00:18:05,359 --> 00:18:11,399
have a a shardon a terar Vine from

448
00:18:08,599 --> 00:18:13,319
Chardon go to shabi in shab is very cool

449
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:14,840
climate and Chardon is really at the

450
00:18:13,319 --> 00:18:16,839
limit of its ripening condition the

451
00:18:14,839 --> 00:18:18,359
Chardon ripens in the last days of

452
00:18:16,839 --> 00:18:20,798
September or early October and then you

453
00:18:18,359 --> 00:18:23,678
have a lot of Aromas from chardonay in

454
00:18:20,798 --> 00:18:25,319
your shab wine for so Blan for instance

455
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:28,000
if you take a if you pick up a Chardon

456
00:18:25,319 --> 00:18:29,558
from South Australia which ripens uh in

457
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,480
February

458
00:18:29,558 --> 00:18:33,798
um then you get no Chardon Flavor in

459
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:36,159
Your grapes so you need to Oak it very

460
00:18:33,798 --> 00:18:38,000
much and have a mctic fermentation to

461
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:40,799
get Aromas in your wine if you go to

462
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Marboro where chardonay ripens very late

463
00:18:40,798 --> 00:18:44,918
in the season in April sometimes even

464
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,200
early May which corresponds to early

465
00:18:44,919 --> 00:18:49,200
November in in in the northern

466
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:51,759
hemisphere then you have a lot of Aromas

467
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:53,679
from so BL in your in your wine so it's

468
00:18:51,759 --> 00:18:57,400
very important to be on the limit of

469
00:18:53,679 --> 00:19:00,559
your ripening conditions to make terar

470
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:02,880
wines so to optimize their expression if

471
00:19:00,558 --> 00:19:05,119
the climate is warm choose late ripening

472
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:07,720
varieties and in NEPA they understood

473
00:19:05,119 --> 00:19:09,158
when they had fera in the 1990s they

474
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:12,159
they pulled up all their Chardon and

475
00:19:09,159 --> 00:19:13,760
replaced it by caban and caban is

476
00:19:12,159 --> 00:19:16,000
ripening in Napa at the end of September

477
00:19:13,759 --> 00:19:18,919
or early October so you can make a ter

478
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:22,279
wine with caban in Napa but you cannot

479
00:19:18,919 --> 00:19:25,840
make a ter wine from from caban you can

480
00:19:22,279 --> 00:19:28,839
make a terar wine in Napa but not with

481
00:19:25,839 --> 00:19:30,599
Chardon uh or if you want to grow uh

482
00:19:28,839 --> 00:19:32,319
early ripening varieties and there are

483
00:19:30,599 --> 00:19:33,759
many nice flavored varieties among the

484
00:19:32,319 --> 00:19:37,918
early ripening varieties and you have to

485
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:39,240
look for cool climate sites like caneros

486
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:41,240
which is closer to the Bay from San

487
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:43,319
Francisco climate is much cooler and

488
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:46,200
there you get Aromas in your Pon Noir in

489
00:19:43,319 --> 00:19:49,519
your Chardon I already gave the example

490
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:52,038
of s for Maro for Pinon is a very nice

491
00:19:49,519 --> 00:19:53,759
place in New Zealand which is Central oo

492
00:19:52,038 --> 00:19:55,400
you see the snow on the mountains very

493
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:59,519
cool conditions and they make great

494
00:19:55,400 --> 00:20:02,240
ponir with a lot of flavor

495
00:19:59,519 --> 00:20:03,759
so that's about um the timing of phology

496
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:05,400
so that's the first point which is very

497
00:20:03,759 --> 00:20:08,200
important second point which is

498
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:11,480
important to make wines um expressing

499
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:13,798
terar is the water status and in fact if

500
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:15,240
you look at all the great wines produced

501
00:20:13,798 --> 00:20:18,200
around the world and particularly for

502
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:19,880
red wines the best wines are always made

503
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:22,519
under water

504
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:24,880
deficit so water deficit is very

505
00:20:22,519 --> 00:20:26,759
important now what happens when Vines

506
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:29,960
meet water deficit you probably all know

507
00:20:26,759 --> 00:20:32,079
these the Sho grow steps stops early in

508
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:35,079
the season so if you look at these this

509
00:20:32,079 --> 00:20:37,359
slide here you have the water potentials

510
00:20:35,079 --> 00:20:39,038
so you're more you go to the left side

511
00:20:37,359 --> 00:20:40,798
the lower the water potential so the

512
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:42,119
more water deficit and here you have the

513
00:20:40,798 --> 00:20:44,639
day of the year that they should stop

514
00:20:42,119 --> 00:20:46,639
growing there's a quite good correlation

515
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:48,679
between the day the Sho stop growing and

516
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:51,360
the water deficit the more water deficit

517
00:20:48,679 --> 00:20:53,400
the earlier the shoots stop

518
00:20:51,359 --> 00:20:55,119
growing now you have the same sort of

519
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:58,240
correlation for Berry size here's the

520
00:20:55,119 --> 00:20:59,959
correlation between water potentials and

521
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:02,480
uh Berry weight and you get small

522
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:05,640
berries when Vines are grown under water

523
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:07,400
deficit conditions you get lower mic

524
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:09,919
acid which simply means that your grapes

525
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:12,759
are ripener very good correlation

526
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:15,038
between water deficit and mic acid in

527
00:21:12,759 --> 00:21:18,158
the grapes and you get the opposite

528
00:21:15,038 --> 00:21:20,240
correlation with ocins the more water

529
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:22,400
deficit the higher the ocins in your

530
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:25,240
grapes now you know all that if you want

531
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:27,640
to grow high quality Reds then you need

532
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:31,038
shot grow sensation around or before

533
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:33,759
verason small small berries low mic acid

534
00:21:31,038 --> 00:21:37,359
and high antoin so that means that to

535
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:40,720
grow high quality rats you need water

536
00:21:37,359 --> 00:21:42,119
deficit which does not mean severe

537
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:45,038
stress of

538
00:21:42,119 --> 00:21:47,319
course now Vine water status depend on

539
00:21:45,038 --> 00:21:50,079
climate rainfall potential a PO

540
00:21:47,319 --> 00:21:52,599
transpiration the soil water holding

541
00:21:50,079 --> 00:21:54,639
capacity on the vine some root stocks

542
00:21:52,599 --> 00:21:56,319
are more resistant to draw than others

543
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:58,720
the variety some varieties are more

544
00:21:56,319 --> 00:22:01,720
resistant to draw than others and on man

545
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:03,360
ment practices Leaf area the bigger your

546
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:05,798
Leaf area the more

547
00:22:03,359 --> 00:22:07,519
transpiration uh crop load Vineyard

548
00:22:05,798 --> 00:22:09,720
floor management you can create

549
00:22:07,519 --> 00:22:12,240
competition for water between cover crop

550
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:16,278
and and the vine and of course if your

551
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:19,440
your conditions are too dry you can

552
00:22:16,278 --> 00:22:22,278
irrigate so water is

553
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:25,440
important third uh pillar of terar

554
00:22:22,278 --> 00:22:28,119
expression are so minerals but uh in

555
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:31,798
fact most of the minerals The Vines pick

556
00:22:28,119 --> 00:22:33,599
up from the the soil have not um uh a

557
00:22:31,798 --> 00:22:35,200
decisive effect on the composition of

558
00:22:33,599 --> 00:22:38,158
the grapes strangely enough one could

559
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:40,120
imagine that iron or pottassium or

560
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:41,880
magnesium or calcium or whatever would

561
00:22:40,119 --> 00:22:43,038
have a big impact on Grape composition

562
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:45,120
and in fact many Studies have been

563
00:22:43,038 --> 00:22:47,960
carried out and these minerals only have

564
00:22:45,119 --> 00:22:50,558
marginal effect on Grape composition

565
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:52,480
except situations of clear excess and

566
00:22:50,558 --> 00:22:54,319
severe deficiency of course those

567
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:56,599
extremes are never good but when you are

568
00:22:54,319 --> 00:22:58,839
in a reasonable range for these minerals

569
00:22:56,599 --> 00:23:00,480
the impact on the composition of the

570
00:22:58,839 --> 00:23:02,918
grapes and the quality of the wine is

571
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:05,360
not decisive there's one exception

572
00:23:02,919 --> 00:23:08,440
that's nitrogen nitrogen really has a

573
00:23:05,359 --> 00:23:12,119
big impact on Vine Vigor on on Cho

574
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:15,000
growth and on Grape uh composition so

575
00:23:12,119 --> 00:23:17,359
this is some results from a trial we

576
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:21,240
carried out also some time ago at chat

577
00:23:17,359 --> 00:23:24,119
Leo vas Kaza which is one of the famous

578
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:26,839
most famous Estates from from Bordeaux

579
00:23:24,119 --> 00:23:29,199
and we had um a network of plots and I

580
00:23:26,839 --> 00:23:31,519
only show the results from three blocks

581
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:35,360
at leasa to study why some blocks

582
00:23:31,519 --> 00:23:40,319
produce better wines than others now in

583
00:23:35,359 --> 00:23:43,038
many situations where we measured uh the

584
00:23:40,319 --> 00:23:45,240
the the impact of the soil on on the

585
00:23:43,038 --> 00:23:46,359
quality of the of the quality potential

586
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:48,720
of the grapes and the quality of the

587
00:23:46,359 --> 00:23:50,558
wines it turned out that that water was

588
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:53,600
decisive Factor now it happened to be

589
00:23:50,558 --> 00:23:55,720
that we were at leas in 1997 which was a

590
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:58,719
very rainy vintage SO in this rainy

591
00:23:55,720 --> 00:24:00,720
vintage there was no water defic it

592
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:02,839
whatsoever on any of the blocks because

593
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:04,558
it just it rained all the time but there

594
00:24:02,839 --> 00:24:07,119
were big variation we noticed there were

595
00:24:04,558 --> 00:24:08,879
big variations in nitrogen status just

596
00:24:07,119 --> 00:24:10,798
because of different composition of the

597
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:13,640
soil some blocks were very low in

598
00:24:10,798 --> 00:24:15,558
nitrogen some were medium high and

599
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:17,679
somewh high and this is yeast available

600
00:24:15,558 --> 00:24:19,359
nitrogen which responds very well to the

601
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:21,960
amount of nitrogen that's available in

602
00:24:19,359 --> 00:24:23,719
the soil and what we noticed that if

603
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:26,440
nitrogen was low which was the case for

604
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:29,558
this block that pruning weight was lower

605
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:33,558
yield was lower Berry weight was

606
00:24:29,558 --> 00:24:36,480
smaller acidity was lower and um there

607
00:24:33,558 --> 00:24:38,678
were was more sugar more ocins and the

608
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:40,798
ratings for the wine we made wine by

609
00:24:38,679 --> 00:24:43,000
microvinifications and in fact with the

610
00:24:40,798 --> 00:24:44,879
low nitrogen in the grapes the quality

611
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,679
was better and once again low nitrogen

612
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:48,640
does not mean severe deficiency of

613
00:24:46,679 --> 00:24:52,440
course severe nitrogen deficiency is not

614
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:53,759
good but for making growing red wine

615
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:55,759
it's better to be a little bit on the

616
00:24:53,759 --> 00:24:58,558
lower end of nitrogen status than on the

617
00:24:55,759 --> 00:25:00,398
high end this will reduce your Vigor and

618
00:24:58,558 --> 00:25:02,639
uh particularly in in wet conditions

619
00:25:00,398 --> 00:25:05,119
where water is not limiting nitrogen can

620
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:07,159
be another limiting factor which slows

621
00:25:05,119 --> 00:25:10,000
your Sho growth which reduces Berry size

622
00:25:07,159 --> 00:25:12,720
reduces Vigor reduces yields and and and

623
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:16,480
promotes the production of ocins and

624
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:18,440
tenin in your grapes this is for Reds

625
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:20,960
for whites it's a little bit different

626
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:22,880
because in for to make white wine you

627
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:26,440
don't want tenants in your grapes you

628
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:29,679
want Aromas and many Aroma compounds

629
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:32,278
respond positively to nitrogen which is

630
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:33,880
particularly the case for volatile theor

631
00:25:32,278 --> 00:25:39,960
which are involved in the aroma of many

632
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:42,360
varieties like so Blan wling uh SE um

633
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:45,399
and so we studied the the precursors of

634
00:25:42,359 --> 00:25:47,000
volatile theor and grapes under low

635
00:25:45,398 --> 00:25:49,000
nitrogen conditions and conditions where

636
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:52,319
we added nitrogen and all these

637
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:55,679
precursors were very much boosted by

638
00:25:52,319 --> 00:25:57,599
nitrogen the the tenants were reduced

639
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:59,440
this is exactly the same response as in

640
00:25:57,599 --> 00:26:01,879
rats but the difference between Reds and

641
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:04,278
whites that in Reds you want tenants and

642
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:06,799
in whites you do not want tenants so in

643
00:26:04,278 --> 00:26:09,798
whites it's better to be a little bit on

644
00:26:06,798 --> 00:26:11,359
the high side with nitrogen uh which

645
00:26:09,798 --> 00:26:12,639
does not mean excess because if you have

646
00:26:11,359 --> 00:26:14,839
really excess of nitrogen it will

647
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:18,240
promote buritis and which is not good in

648
00:26:14,839 --> 00:26:22,119
Reds and not good in

649
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:25,278
whites so um timing of phology water and

650
00:26:22,119 --> 00:26:28,879
nitrogen are essential factors in terar

651
00:26:25,278 --> 00:26:30,960
expression now how can we measure these

652
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:33,200
so the timing of phology Depends very

653
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:36,200
much on climatic conditions so it's good

654
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:38,440
to have a good Insight in uh climatic

655
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:41,159
conditions on your estate while climate

656
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:43,440
is very easy to measure it just put down

657
00:26:41,159 --> 00:26:45,679
a weather station you can measure

658
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:48,558
temperatures which will be a driving

659
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:50,720
factor for phology uh you can measure

660
00:26:48,558 --> 00:26:53,319
the rainfall which have an impact on the

661
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:55,600
water status of your Vines and you can

662
00:26:53,319 --> 00:26:58,079
me measure potential aable transpiration

663
00:26:55,599 --> 00:26:59,000
which is when you make a water balance

664
00:26:58,079 --> 00:27:01,000
and

665
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,759
potential a transpiration has as much

666
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,798
impact on the final result as has

667
00:27:02,759 --> 00:27:07,158
rainfall and generally people forget

668
00:27:04,798 --> 00:27:08,960
about evot transpiration if the if they

669
00:27:07,159 --> 00:27:10,600
compare climatic situations generally

670
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:12,399
people compare rainfall they say in this

671
00:27:10,599 --> 00:27:14,359
area we have so much rainfall this area

672
00:27:12,398 --> 00:27:17,278
so much but it's also important to take

673
00:27:14,359 --> 00:27:19,678
into account potential EV transpiration

674
00:27:17,278 --> 00:27:21,720
solar radiation is also important for

675
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:24,038
photosynthesis and particularly for

676
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:28,360
color

677
00:27:24,038 --> 00:27:30,759
accumulation um so um phology so I told

678
00:27:28,359 --> 00:27:34,719
you that the timing of phology is very

679
00:27:30,759 --> 00:27:36,679
important uh to grow um um high quality

680
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:39,000
grapes now of course you can go into the

681
00:27:36,679 --> 00:27:42,840
field and measure phology but you can

682
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:46,720
also predict it by pH phological uh

683
00:27:42,839 --> 00:27:48,959
models um and these pH phological models

684
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:51,480
can help you to choose the varieties

685
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:54,679
which are most adapted to your local

686
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:56,640
situation so in most situations people

687
00:27:54,679 --> 00:27:58,519
have figured out which are the right

688
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:00,480
varieties in their climatic I conditions

689
00:27:58,519 --> 00:28:02,558
by trial and error and it happens every

690
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:05,599
time if people plant grapes in a new

691
00:28:02,558 --> 00:28:07,918
area they will try dozens of variety and

692
00:28:05,599 --> 00:28:09,719
then they will will end up after one or

693
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:11,559
two generations saying oh for this area

694
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:13,159
this is the right variety but you can do

695
00:28:11,558 --> 00:28:16,038
it a little bit quicker you can save

696
00:28:13,159 --> 00:28:20,200
time and money by using phological uh

697
00:28:16,038 --> 00:28:23,839
models just because um um pH phological

698
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:26,519
models are often quite simple models

699
00:28:23,839 --> 00:28:28,839
because the main driving factor in

700
00:28:26,519 --> 00:28:31,440
phology is temperature there are other

701
00:28:28,839 --> 00:28:33,240
factors involved but the main factor is

702
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:36,240
uh temperature and temperature is easy

703
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:38,399
to model so phology can be predicted

704
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:42,399
with process-based models and you use

705
00:28:38,398 --> 00:28:45,479
then temperature as input uh data there

706
00:28:42,398 --> 00:28:47,398
are a few examples of very old models

707
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:48,720
which are very much used in the industry

708
00:28:47,398 --> 00:28:50,398
and the Winkler model which is a

709
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:52,278
temperature sum based of 10 degre

710
00:28:50,398 --> 00:28:53,719
Centigrade the hling model which is

711
00:28:52,278 --> 00:28:55,880
slightly more complex but not very

712
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:58,919
complex either which is very much used

713
00:28:55,880 --> 00:29:02,000
in uh Europe

714
00:28:58,919 --> 00:29:04,159
um we've done some research on phology

715
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,278
modeling because we think we thought

716
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:10,159
that these existing models could be

717
00:29:06,278 --> 00:29:12,640
improved because when Winkler made his

718
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:16,120
um his model his temperature model he

719
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:18,559
used only phology data from Davis and he

720
00:29:16,119 --> 00:29:20,479
didn't have a computer and hling was the

721
00:29:18,558 --> 00:29:23,038
same when he made his model he had

722
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:24,960
mainly phology data from the kar

723
00:29:23,038 --> 00:29:27,319
research station in alzas he was from

724
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:31,679
alzas um and he didn't have a computer

725
00:29:27,319 --> 00:29:33,359
because it was in 1970s and today um we

726
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:36,600
believe that phological models can be

727
00:29:33,359 --> 00:29:38,639
improved by using more data and by by

728
00:29:36,599 --> 00:29:41,439
just using computer power computational

729
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:43,759
power so when we started to think about

730
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:45,840
the new phological model we started to

731
00:29:43,759 --> 00:29:47,759
collect phology data for two or three

732
00:29:45,839 --> 00:29:51,158
years we just were collecting phology

733
00:29:47,759 --> 00:29:53,839
data from different locations and um we

734
00:29:51,159 --> 00:29:57,360
managed to collect over 4,000 phology

735
00:29:53,839 --> 00:30:00,839
observations from 123 location 81

736
00:29:57,359 --> 00:30:03,639
varieties and spending over 48 uh

737
00:30:00,839 --> 00:30:06,359
vintages uh we collaborated with a

738
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:08,440
phology modeler he's quite famous Isel

739
00:30:06,359 --> 00:30:11,439
shun she has several papers in in in

740
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:13,558
nature and she made a phology modeling

741
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:15,440
platform in this phology modeling

742
00:30:13,558 --> 00:30:17,200
platform you put your phenology data you

743
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:20,120
put your temperature data and you can

744
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:23,840
test a whole range of models and then

745
00:30:20,119 --> 00:30:27,119
fit your models um uh with uh your your

746
00:30:23,839 --> 00:30:29,398
data we were also very careful about the

747
00:30:27,119 --> 00:30:31,518
quality of the matal data and we only

748
00:30:29,398 --> 00:30:33,918
used phology observations when we had

749
00:30:31,519 --> 00:30:36,440
the Meto data from located at less than

750
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:38,799
5 kilm from the from the plot and less

751
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:41,080
than 100 met in altitude to be sure that

752
00:30:38,798 --> 00:30:44,839
the temperature data was representative

753
00:30:41,079 --> 00:30:46,398
for the uh for the site and we we we

754
00:30:44,839 --> 00:30:49,038
created a model which we called

755
00:30:46,398 --> 00:30:50,798
Grapevine flowering ver raisin model and

756
00:30:49,038 --> 00:30:53,200
to create this model we tested several

757
00:30:50,798 --> 00:30:55,480
types of models linear models or beta

758
00:30:53,200 --> 00:31:00,639
models and we tested other

759
00:30:55,480 --> 00:31:02,278
models um and in fact the result um um I

760
00:31:00,638 --> 00:31:03,879
have no time to go into the details but

761
00:31:02,278 --> 00:31:06,200
the surprisingly the result was that the

762
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:08,278
linear models gave results that were

763
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:10,159
almost as good and sometimes even better

764
00:31:08,278 --> 00:31:12,759
than the more complex models and of

765
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:14,278
course we chosen the simple models

766
00:31:12,759 --> 00:31:16,119
because it's also very important to

767
00:31:14,278 --> 00:31:17,638
transfer these models to the industry

768
00:31:16,119 --> 00:31:20,199
and the easier they are to use the more

769
00:31:17,638 --> 00:31:23,839
chance you have to transfer them to the

770
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:25,399
industry so uh from this modeling uh

771
00:31:23,839 --> 00:31:27,678
came out that the best models were

772
00:31:25,398 --> 00:31:29,959
linear models so we just had to fix the

773
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:31,919
base Bas temperature and the and the day

774
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:35,120
from which you count you start counting

775
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:37,559
your temperature sum and um surprisingly

776
00:31:35,119 --> 00:31:38,879
for base temperature very low base

777
00:31:37,558 --> 00:31:42,158
temperatures turned out to be much

778
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:44,480
better than the general generally in in

779
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:46,039
existing phology medals it was assumed

780
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:48,558
that the base temperature for Vines is

781
00:31:46,038 --> 00:31:51,519
10° Centigrade so these temper these

782
00:31:48,558 --> 00:31:53,759
temperature summations take out 10° and

783
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:55,558
in fact we got better results from low

784
00:31:53,759 --> 00:31:58,079
temperature threshold and we even chose

785
00:31:55,558 --> 00:31:59,879
a threshold of 0°

786
00:31:58,079 --> 00:32:01,839
is because just in terms of efficiency

787
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:02,760
the closer the efficiency to one the

788
00:32:01,839 --> 00:32:05,720
better the

789
00:32:02,759 --> 00:32:07,839
model uh root mean squared error is the

790
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:09,839
error of prediction in days so eight

791
00:32:07,839 --> 00:32:12,839
days if you see the more we increase the

792
00:32:09,839 --> 00:32:13,638
base temperature the the the worse the

793
00:32:12,839 --> 00:32:17,038
the the

794
00:32:13,638 --> 00:32:19,158
prediction now for the um the time we

795
00:32:17,038 --> 00:32:21,079
start to count the temperature sum we

796
00:32:19,159 --> 00:32:25,000
tested several days starting at the 1 of

797
00:32:21,079 --> 00:32:27,960
January or or several days and in fact

798
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:30,599
um the best result was that they uh they

799
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:32,798
the year 60 so the Grapevine flowering

800
00:32:30,599 --> 00:32:34,638
ver raisin model is a very simple model

801
00:32:32,798 --> 00:32:37,000
it's a summation of daily average

802
00:32:34,638 --> 00:32:38,319
temperature that's starts counting at

803
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,240
the 1st of March on the Northern

804
00:32:38,319 --> 00:32:42,759
Hemisphere day of the year 60 with a

805
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:44,919
base temperature of Siri 0 degre

806
00:32:42,759 --> 00:32:47,278
Centigrade which makes that it remains

807
00:32:44,919 --> 00:32:48,880
very easy to use of course we had to

808
00:32:47,278 --> 00:32:51,200
prove that it was better than existing

809
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:53,720
model so we compared it to the growing

810
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:55,960
decree model from um Winkler and which

811
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:58,000
starts to to count at day one 1 of

812
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:59,720
January with a base temperature of 10°

813
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,038
Centigrade now for flowering there was

814
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:03,038
not much difference in terms of

815
00:33:01,038 --> 00:33:05,240
efficiency these two models were very

816
00:33:03,038 --> 00:33:07,038
very close but for verason the

817
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:09,638
prediction with the gfv model is much

818
00:33:07,038 --> 00:33:13,119
better in terms of efficiency it's

819
00:33:09,638 --> 00:33:15,079
0.72 compared to4 for the Winkler model

820
00:33:13,119 --> 00:33:18,278
and in terms of of precision of

821
00:33:15,079 --> 00:33:20,439
prediction the gfv model predicts um

822
00:33:18,278 --> 00:33:23,119
verason with an error of s to eight days

823
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:27,519
whereas the GD gdd model predict it with

824
00:33:23,119 --> 00:33:27,518
an error of about two weeks

825
00:33:28,599 --> 00:33:32,599
we validated of course the model on 20%

826
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:34,639
of the data set and we got very nice

827
00:33:32,599 --> 00:33:36,240
Curves in terms for flowering or for

828
00:33:34,638 --> 00:33:39,558
veras a little bit more scatter of

829
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:41,200
course of theasin um and this work was

830
00:33:39,558 --> 00:33:43,960
published in the Australian Journal of

831
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:47,278
grape and vne research

832
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:51,038
paper published in 2011 now the next

833
00:33:47,278 --> 00:33:53,480
step was to classify for prosity a large

834
00:33:51,038 --> 00:33:56,240
number of varieties and we had data from

835
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:59,798
approximately 100 varieties so all these

836
00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:02,798
varieties were uh classified for

837
00:33:59,798 --> 00:34:04,839
flowering so from early ripening

838
00:34:02,798 --> 00:34:07,000
varieties to late ripening varieties so

839
00:34:04,839 --> 00:34:09,918
here you have simply the temperature sum

840
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:12,719
calculated with the gfv model to predict

841
00:34:09,918 --> 00:34:14,918
flowering and we did the same thing for

842
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:17,239
verason uh this work was published in

843
00:34:14,918 --> 00:34:19,878
agriculture Forest meterology uh last

844
00:34:17,239 --> 00:34:22,719
year and we're now working on um on

845
00:34:19,878 --> 00:34:25,799
ripening and the next step is uh

846
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:27,519
ripening and also we have um the error

847
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:29,320
bars for the prediction and of course

848
00:34:27,519 --> 00:34:30,878
for for the major varieties we a very

849
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:33,119
small error bars because we had a lot of

850
00:34:30,878 --> 00:34:34,358
data and for more obscure varieties

851
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:36,639
where we sometimes we had only three

852
00:34:34,358 --> 00:34:38,799
four or five data points the error bar

853
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:41,480
can be quite substantial so if we get

854
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:44,200
more data we can improve the the

855
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:49,639
prediction for the varieties in terms of

856
00:34:44,199 --> 00:34:53,039
uh U limiting the the error

857
00:34:49,639 --> 00:34:54,720
bars um how can we measure water status

858
00:34:53,039 --> 00:34:56,559
well I will go quite quickly because

859
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:58,519
you're familiar with these techniques I

860
00:34:56,559 --> 00:35:00,358
firmly believe that you should measure

861
00:34:58,519 --> 00:35:02,440
water states of the vines on the vines

862
00:35:00,358 --> 00:35:04,519
and not in the soil I started doing my

863
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:06,760
PhD measuring it in the soil I have no

864
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:08,280
time about to talk about that but but I

865
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:09,839
think it's much more efficient to

866
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:13,280
measure the water status straight on the

867
00:35:09,838 --> 00:35:15,838
vine and to measure it in the soil and

868
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:19,320
um I started working with water

869
00:35:15,838 --> 00:35:22,039
potentials uh in 1990 and I still

870
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:24,960
believe that it's a great great tool for

871
00:35:22,039 --> 00:35:26,960
monitoring um water status is not very

872
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:28,960
popular among Growers just because you

873
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:31,119
have to go into the field with your

874
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:33,079
pressure chamber and do the measurement

875
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:34,760
uh do the measurement the generally

876
00:35:33,079 --> 00:35:36,320
Growers or Vineyard managers they prefer

877
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:38,599
to stay in their office and look at the

878
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:41,400
computer data and up to now it's not yet

879
00:35:38,599 --> 00:35:43,680
possible to optimize the the water

880
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:45,960
potential measure bit but maybe one day

881
00:35:43,679 --> 00:35:47,319
Allan it will be possible to to monitor

882
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:50,559
the water potential directly and have

883
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:52,640
the data coming on your computer in your

884
00:35:50,559 --> 00:35:56,318
office um

885
00:35:52,639 --> 00:35:59,239
so we've over the over the last 25 years

886
00:35:56,318 --> 00:36:01,800
we've accumulated a lot lot of data from

887
00:35:59,239 --> 00:36:04,519
um water potential measurements and

888
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:06,760
today we focus on stem water potential

889
00:36:04,519 --> 00:36:09,199
um preon water the potential also very

890
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:11,400
fine but Le water the potential there's

891
00:36:09,199 --> 00:36:12,598
too much influence of the climatic

892
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:15,400
conditions and the particular position

893
00:36:12,599 --> 00:36:17,000
of the leaf so we now we no longer use

894
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:18,880
Lea water potential we use either stem

895
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:21,880
water potential or preone leaf water

896
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:24,160
potential um to assess the water status

897
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:26,000
of the vine and here you see curves of

898
00:36:24,159 --> 00:36:28,239
three different vintages in Bordeaux we

899
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,760
don't irrigate our Vines

900
00:36:28,239 --> 00:36:32,479
um and you see that the water states of

901
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:33,960
the vines can be very variable depending

902
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:36,838
on the Vintage so if you have a dry

903
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:38,760
vintage 2 2005 was the driest vintage

904
00:36:36,838 --> 00:36:40,838
ever recorded in Bordeaux and water

905
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:42,680
potentials can go very down deep down

906
00:36:40,838 --> 00:36:45,199
these are stem water potentials going

907
00:36:42,679 --> 00:36:48,279
down to minus almost minus 2 megap

908
00:36:45,199 --> 00:36:49,719
Pascal in 2005 and the vines didn't die

909
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:52,560
they didn't crash they even made very

910
00:36:49,719 --> 00:36:54,879
good Vine um in 200 2007 which was a

911
00:36:52,559 --> 00:36:58,559
very wet vintage stem water potentials

912
00:36:54,880 --> 00:37:01,680
remained in the range -.6 -8 megapascal

913
00:36:58,559 --> 00:37:03,400
in 2004 was a moderately dry vintage

914
00:37:01,679 --> 00:37:07,719
where water potentials dropped down to

915
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:10,800
minus 1.2 - 1.3 megap Pascal at the end

916
00:37:07,719 --> 00:37:12,358
of the season uh you can also monitor

917
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:14,240
the water states of the vine on

918
00:37:12,358 --> 00:37:17,159
different blocks in the same vintage so

919
00:37:14,239 --> 00:37:19,239
this is in the 2005 vintage three blocks

920
00:37:17,159 --> 00:37:21,039
grav soil with low water holding

921
00:37:19,239 --> 00:37:23,358
capacity this is where the water

922
00:37:21,039 --> 00:37:25,358
potential goes down very much a sandy

923
00:37:23,358 --> 00:37:27,199
soil with water table where the water

924
00:37:25,358 --> 00:37:29,759
potential does not go down too much

925
00:37:27,199 --> 00:37:31,960
because the water table and a clay soil

926
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:34,920
with moderate water deficit stress so a

927
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:37,280
very fine tool to very precisely monitor

928
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:40,240
the water stages of the vines over the

929
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:43,079
season and of course if you irrigate

930
00:37:40,239 --> 00:37:44,879
it's also a very very fine tool to monit

931
00:37:43,079 --> 00:37:47,400
monitor irrigation I think it's the best

932
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:49,400
tool in the world to monitor Irrigation

933
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:52,920
in

934
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:54,599
Vines um but there is one drawback is

935
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:56,599
that you have to go in the field and

936
00:37:54,599 --> 00:37:57,920
people don't like going into the field

937
00:37:56,599 --> 00:38:00,240
to do measurements because it's

938
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:03,440
constraining and also another limitation

939
00:38:00,239 --> 00:38:05,559
which is a real limitation is that um

940
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:07,880
you can only monitor a limited number of

941
00:38:05,559 --> 00:38:09,799
blocks whether you do pre-done leave

942
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:11,480
water potential or stem water potential

943
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:12,680
there's a limited time during the day

944
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:14,760
that you can do the measurement for

945
00:38:12,679 --> 00:38:17,639
pre-done in the two or 3 hours before

946
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:20,640
Dawn in the stem potential it's in just

947
00:38:17,639 --> 00:38:23,078
after um afternoon in the early

948
00:38:20,639 --> 00:38:24,400
afternoon and so depending on the

949
00:38:23,079 --> 00:38:26,680
distance between your blocks you can

950
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:29,079
monitor five six eight or maximum 10

951
00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:31,799
blocks you cannot monitor 50 blocks or

952
00:38:29,079 --> 00:38:33,200
100 blocks with this technique so uh a

953
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:35,560
couple of years ago we were looking for

954
00:38:33,199 --> 00:38:37,919
a technique where it was possible to

955
00:38:35,559 --> 00:38:40,199
monitor the the water states of the

956
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:43,000
vines without being Limited in the

957
00:38:40,199 --> 00:38:46,879
number of blocks that you could Monitor

958
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:49,280
and um um we adapted the method to Vines

959
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:52,559
which is based on discrimination of uh

960
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:54,519
carbon Isotopes in uh in grapes now the

961
00:38:52,559 --> 00:38:56,759
principle of this technique is that

962
00:38:54,519 --> 00:38:58,880
ambient CO2 and we're talking about

963
00:38:56,760 --> 00:39:01,839
stable isotop and not carbon 14 of

964
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:06,119
course no not radioactive isotopes um

965
00:39:01,838 --> 00:39:09,880
ambient CO2 contains 98.9% of carbon 12

966
00:39:06,119 --> 00:39:12,358
and 1.1% of carbon 13 now during

967
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:15,160
photosynthesis the enzymes involved in

968
00:39:12,358 --> 00:39:17,598
transforming CO2 into sugar they prefer

969
00:39:15,159 --> 00:39:19,879
to pick up carbon 12 so in the sugar

970
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:22,400
produced by photosynthesis there's more

971
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:25,720
is a bigger proportion of carbon 12 than

972
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:28,318
there is an ambient CO2 but when Vines

973
00:39:25,719 --> 00:39:30,879
meet water deficit stress the stom close

974
00:39:28,318 --> 00:39:33,159
and that there's still CO2 in the leaf

975
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:34,559
and the enzym start to pick up carbon 12

976
00:39:33,159 --> 00:39:36,519
and when there's no more carbon 12 they

977
00:39:34,559 --> 00:39:39,279
have to pick up carbon 13 so the

978
00:39:36,519 --> 00:39:42,559
proportion of carbon 13 integrated in

979
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:44,880
sugars by photosynthesis increases with

980
00:39:42,559 --> 00:39:47,679
stomatal closure and in fact it's

981
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:50,160
completely proportional the longer the

982
00:39:47,679 --> 00:39:52,679
stomata are closed the more carbon 13

983
00:39:50,159 --> 00:39:54,759
will be integrated in grape sugar now

984
00:39:52,679 --> 00:39:57,759
the sug in the sugar now the sugar

985
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:59,520
produced will end up in the grapes so if

986
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:01,079
at the end of the ripening period you

987
00:39:59,519 --> 00:40:03,519
pick up a sample of grape juice and send

988
00:40:01,079 --> 00:40:05,359
it to a specialized lab we doing stable

989
00:40:03,519 --> 00:40:07,519
isotope analysis and you measure

990
00:40:05,358 --> 00:40:10,119
proportion of carbon 13 the more carbon

991
00:40:07,519 --> 00:40:11,838
13 you have in your grape sugar the the

992
00:40:10,119 --> 00:40:15,358
the greater the water deficit stress the

993
00:40:11,838 --> 00:40:19,318
vines faced during grape ripening so

994
00:40:15,358 --> 00:40:21,078
it's an integrative tool to measure say

995
00:40:19,318 --> 00:40:23,400
let's say the average water deficit

996
00:40:21,079 --> 00:40:25,880
stress experienced by The Vines from the

997
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:28,760
raisin to

998
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:31,920
ripeness the this ratio of carbon 13

999
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:35,119
carbon 12 which is called Delta 13 C is

1000
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:36,838
expressed against the standard and um so

1001
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:38,559
those Laboratories who the analyz they

1002
00:40:36,838 --> 00:40:41,519
have they all have the same standard and

1003
00:40:38,559 --> 00:40:44,279
they compare the ratio with the standard

1004
00:40:41,519 --> 00:40:47,000
and um so I have no times to go into

1005
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:49,760
details how this calculation is done but

1006
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:52,358
just retain that if the result is minus

1007
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:54,520
27 then it means the stata were open all

1008
00:40:52,358 --> 00:40:57,598
the time and there was no water deficit

1009
00:40:54,519 --> 00:40:59,759
and if the result is minus 20 then The

1010
00:40:57,599 --> 00:41:01,640
Vines fac severe water deficit stress

1011
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:05,000
and the stomata were virtually closed

1012
00:41:01,639 --> 00:41:07,519
all the time from ver raisin to ripeness

1013
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:10,719
so this we published in 2002 in Journal

1014
00:41:07,519 --> 00:41:13,280
of experimental uh

1015
00:41:10,719 --> 00:41:15,598
botany um you're probably more familiar

1016
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:19,079
with water potentials so here you have

1017
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:22,000
the the um translation from for instance

1018
00:41:19,079 --> 00:41:24,760
stem water potential values with Delta

1019
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:27,800
13 C so here you see the range so minus

1020
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:30,040
21 in uh water deficit would

1021
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:30,920
correspond to a stem water potential of

1022
00:41:30,039 --> 00:41:33,880
minus

1023
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:36,280
1.4

1024
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:38,039
megapascal um so there are several

1025
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:40,079
advantages of this technique that it's

1026
00:41:38,039 --> 00:41:42,358
easy to measure of course you need

1027
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:44,039
specialized equipment but you can there

1028
00:41:42,358 --> 00:41:45,719
are Labs who are specializ in isotope

1029
00:41:44,039 --> 00:41:48,159
analyzis you just send your grape juice

1030
00:41:45,719 --> 00:41:49,879
and they make the analyzis it gives you

1031
00:41:48,159 --> 00:41:52,039
an integrated measurement of the wine

1032
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:53,559
water status during the ripening period

1033
00:41:52,039 --> 00:41:55,400
And there's no more limitation in the

1034
00:41:53,559 --> 00:41:56,920
number of plats plots you can sample

1035
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:58,639
it's just the price you have to pay

1036
00:41:56,920 --> 00:42:00,720
which is about depending on the number

1037
00:41:58,639 --> 00:42:04,199
of samples between 50

1038
00:42:00,719 --> 00:42:05,759
and7 a sample um but there's no

1039
00:42:04,199 --> 00:42:07,480
limitation in the number if you have 100

1040
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:09,079
blocks and you want to know the water

1041
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:11,519
states of your Vines and 100 blocks you

1042
00:42:09,079 --> 00:42:13,519
can sample 100 grape samples and and

1043
00:42:11,519 --> 00:42:16,159
send them to the lab and have them

1044
00:42:13,519 --> 00:42:19,079
analyzed it's also a very nice tool to

1045
00:42:16,159 --> 00:42:20,679
validate irrigation strategies

1046
00:42:19,079 --> 00:42:23,160
afterwards

1047
00:42:20,679 --> 00:42:26,078
um when people irrigate if you want to

1048
00:42:23,159 --> 00:42:29,279
do quality irrigation for producing

1049
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:31,240
quality grapes then you should maintain

1050
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:33,240
water deficit but Mo moderate water

1051
00:42:31,239 --> 00:42:35,358
deficit but it's very difficult not to

1052
00:42:33,239 --> 00:42:37,838
add too much water but to add enough

1053
00:42:35,358 --> 00:42:39,838
water and it's very nice to have a tool

1054
00:42:37,838 --> 00:42:42,440
that in the end you can say okay my

1055
00:42:39,838 --> 00:42:45,000
irrigation strategy was okay I I managed

1056
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:46,679
to maintain moderate water deficit just

1057
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:49,679
at the end of the season you pick up a

1058
00:42:46,679 --> 00:42:52,519
sample if you in the minus say minus 23

1059
00:42:49,679 --> 00:42:54,679
24 range then your irrigation was okay

1060
00:42:52,519 --> 00:42:56,199
if you if the result is minus 27 then

1061
00:42:54,679 --> 00:42:59,000
you irrigated too much and if the result

1062
00:42:56,199 --> 00:43:01,719
is minus 21 and you did not irrigate

1063
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:04,358
enough of course it is not a tool for

1064
00:43:01,719 --> 00:43:06,358
day-to-day management if you you have

1065
00:43:04,358 --> 00:43:07,960
you have your hand on the tab and you

1066
00:43:06,358 --> 00:43:10,519
need to know if you should open the tab

1067
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:12,079
to water the vines or not then this is

1068
00:43:10,519 --> 00:43:14,759
this result of course is coming too late

1069
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:16,720
and then you need so you can manage

1070
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:18,520
irrigation on a day-to-day basis with

1071
00:43:16,719 --> 00:43:20,039
stem water potential and you can

1072
00:43:18,519 --> 00:43:23,358
validate your irrigation strategy

1073
00:43:20,039 --> 00:43:25,599
afterwards with Delta 13 C uh

1074
00:43:23,358 --> 00:43:28,000
measurements so we started to do this in

1075
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:31,079
a ter trial where we comp compared the

1076
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:33,159
effect of the the soil the climate and

1077
00:43:31,079 --> 00:43:36,599
the grape vine variety on Grape

1078
00:43:33,159 --> 00:43:38,480
composition and wine quality and um so

1079
00:43:36,599 --> 00:43:41,599
we started to do these Delta 13 C

1080
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:44,599
measurements on Grape sugar in 1997 and

1081
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:47,838
we were lucky to have four vintages 1997

1082
00:43:44,599 --> 00:43:50,640
98 99 and 2000 with very contrasting

1083
00:43:47,838 --> 00:43:53,279
climatic conditions 98 was a very dry

1084
00:43:50,639 --> 00:43:56,879
vintage and on our network of blocks the

1085
00:43:53,280 --> 00:44:01,280
average Delta 13 C was minus 22 2000 was

1086
00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:05,079
a wet vintage average Delta 13 was- 23

1087
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:06,319
99 97 were wet vintages minus 24 and

1088
00:44:05,079 --> 00:44:09,680
there was a very good statistical

1089
00:44:06,318 --> 00:44:13,279
separation from the vintages now also

1090
00:44:09,679 --> 00:44:15,440
for the soils we had three soils in the

1091
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:18,000
network with different water holding

1092
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:22,280
capacity a very dry grv soil by the

1093
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:25,199
average Delta 132 isus 22 a clay soil

1094
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:27,880
with moderate um water holding capacity

1095
00:44:25,199 --> 00:44:29,679
minus 23 and the Sandy soil with a water

1096
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:32,838
table within the reach of the roots

1097
00:44:29,679 --> 00:44:34,799
minus 24 so also with this technique we

1098
00:44:32,838 --> 00:44:36,519
managed to separate very well the water

1099
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:38,640
stages of the vines depending on the

1100
00:44:36,519 --> 00:44:40,000
soil now for the grap Vine varieties

1101
00:44:38,639 --> 00:44:42,879
there was very little difference between

1102
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:45,039
caban caban FR and moo which are the

1103
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:47,119
three major varieties we are growing in

1104
00:44:45,039 --> 00:44:49,358
Bordeaux so that means that the grap

1105
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:51,079
Vine variety had not a major effect on

1106
00:44:49,358 --> 00:44:53,039
the water status of the vines and the

1107
00:44:51,079 --> 00:44:55,920
water status was in our conditions

1108
00:44:53,039 --> 00:44:58,079
without irrigation mainly determined by

1109
00:44:55,920 --> 00:45:00,240
the Vintage climatic condition of the

1110
00:44:58,079 --> 00:45:02,079
Vintage and the Sal type so that means

1111
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:05,399
that in terms of interpretation the

1112
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:08,839
interpretation whatever the variety the

1113
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:11,358
the the the the threshold are qu quite

1114
00:45:08,838 --> 00:45:13,119
Universal across a wide range of variety

1115
00:45:11,358 --> 00:45:14,318
which is of course very practical for

1116
00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:16,599
the

1117
00:45:14,318 --> 00:45:19,838
interpretation now how to measure nitrog

1118
00:45:16,599 --> 00:45:22,160
status of the Vines um it's very easy

1119
00:45:19,838 --> 00:45:23,838
with uh plant-based indicators once

1120
00:45:22,159 --> 00:45:25,279
again I'm a believer of plant-based

1121
00:45:23,838 --> 00:45:27,838
indicators rather than soil based

1122
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:30,640
indicators it's very difficult to get a

1123
00:45:27,838 --> 00:45:33,078
good idea of nitrogen States Of Vines by

1124
00:45:30,639 --> 00:45:35,039
doing measurements on soil samples

1125
00:45:33,079 --> 00:45:37,318
because in soil samples you basically

1126
00:45:35,039 --> 00:45:40,119
analyze total nitrogen which is very

1127
00:45:37,318 --> 00:45:42,039
different than available nitrogen so

1128
00:45:40,119 --> 00:45:44,880
there are many organs on the vines where

1129
00:45:42,039 --> 00:45:46,920
you can uh measure nitrogen content and

1130
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:48,680
they all work work pretty well for

1131
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:50,400
assessing the nitrogen state of the vine

1132
00:45:48,679 --> 00:45:52,879
in fact assessing nitrogen states of the

1133
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:55,000
vine is very easy leaf blade analyzes

1134
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:57,039
work very well petal analyzes work very

1135
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:59,280
well and what works very well also is

1136
00:45:57,039 --> 00:46:02,639
the amount of nitrogen in your in your

1137
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:03,680
juice if your nitrogen status is high

1138
00:46:02,639 --> 00:46:05,279
then there's a lot of nitrogen in the

1139
00:46:03,679 --> 00:46:06,639
must if your nitrogen status is low then

1140
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:10,000
there's very little nitrogen in the m so

1141
00:46:06,639 --> 00:46:12,279
it's a very good organ to sample um

1142
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:13,960
nitrogen you can do it on canes you can

1143
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:17,000
also look at the color of the leaf

1144
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:18,800
blades with a minota spot uh meter which

1145
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:20,480
in fact measures the coloration of your

1146
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:22,720
leaves work also very good so all these

1147
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:25,240
indicators very very good we use a lot

1148
00:46:22,719 --> 00:46:27,759
of uh yeast available nitrogen because

1149
00:46:25,239 --> 00:46:29,358
people will will analyze it anyway

1150
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:32,000
because they will analyze it to know if

1151
00:46:29,358 --> 00:46:33,880
they're if they juice bu ferment so it's

1152
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:35,719
very practical with one measurement you

1153
00:46:33,880 --> 00:46:37,358
know if your juice bu forment and for

1154
00:46:35,719 --> 00:46:40,799
the vineyard manager he knows what is

1155
00:46:37,358 --> 00:46:45,440
the nigr status of his uh

1156
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:48,119
Vines so uh we can measure uh we can

1157
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:51,880
predict phology we can measure water

1158
00:46:48,119 --> 00:46:56,079
status and we can measure Vine nitrogen

1159
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:58,680
status but um this assessment has to be

1160
00:46:56,079 --> 00:47:00,800
has to account for special variability

1161
00:46:58,679 --> 00:47:02,838
because it's very nice to know at one

1162
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:04,318
point what is the precocity of your

1163
00:47:02,838 --> 00:47:06,279
phology and what is your water stage and

1164
00:47:04,318 --> 00:47:08,239
what is your nitrogen status but soils

1165
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:10,519
can be so variable that you're not sure

1166
00:47:08,239 --> 00:47:12,078
that 50 m further in your field that the

1167
00:47:10,519 --> 00:47:14,000
water States and nitrogen States will be

1168
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:17,519
the same so it's very important to

1169
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:20,599
account for that special variability so

1170
00:47:17,519 --> 00:47:22,920
how can this be done for climate um a

1171
00:47:20,599 --> 00:47:25,960
few weeks ago you had Benjamin B as a

1172
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:29,280
speaker and Benjamin did his PhD in in

1173
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:31,880
my lab and we work together on the the

1174
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:33,760
assessment of the spal variability of

1175
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:35,240
the climate inside the wine growing

1176
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:39,119
region and of course because we were in

1177
00:47:35,239 --> 00:47:42,598
Bordeaux we worked on data from Bordeaux

1178
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:46,358
and we managed to identify 80 weather

1179
00:47:42,599 --> 00:47:49,519
stations with at least 5 years of data

1180
00:47:46,358 --> 00:47:52,199
and based on the the data from this at

1181
00:47:49,519 --> 00:47:54,519
weather station we created a special

1182
00:47:52,199 --> 00:47:56,679
model for temperatures inside the bord

1183
00:47:54,519 --> 00:47:58,800
area which not only used the data from

1184
00:47:56,679 --> 00:48:02,519
the weather stations but also

1185
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:05,160
environmental Co variables like altitude

1186
00:48:02,519 --> 00:48:07,119
aspect distance from water masses

1187
00:48:05,159 --> 00:48:09,639
distance from the sea distance from the

1188
00:48:07,119 --> 00:48:11,559
forest here here is a big forest and

1189
00:48:09,639 --> 00:48:14,598
also distance from the town of Bordeaux

1190
00:48:11,559 --> 00:48:16,800
which is also a hot spot in uh in the

1191
00:48:14,599 --> 00:48:19,079
area and so we managed to make a very

1192
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:22,240
refined mapping of temperatures all over

1193
00:48:19,079 --> 00:48:23,880
Bordeaux uh for and it was different uh

1194
00:48:22,239 --> 00:48:25,838
for minimum temperatures and for maximum

1195
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:27,480
temperatures for instance the Mok is a

1196
00:48:25,838 --> 00:48:29,960
hot spot for minimum temp temperatures

1197
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:32,880
but not for maximum temperatures pesak

1198
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:34,760
Le south of Bordeaux is cool for minimum

1199
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:37,160
temperatures but warm for maximum

1200
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:39,200
temperatures and sanon which is here is

1201
00:48:37,159 --> 00:48:40,920
warm for minimum temperatures and warm

1202
00:48:39,199 --> 00:48:43,558
for maximum temperatures so it's very

1203
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:45,480
nice to know this special variability

1204
00:48:43,559 --> 00:48:49,559
for instance if you want to adapt grap

1205
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:52,400
Vine varieties to your uh Vineyard and

1206
00:48:49,559 --> 00:48:54,839
now in a in an ongoing research project

1207
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:56,960
we trying to do the same variable

1208
00:48:54,838 --> 00:48:59,759
assessment of temperatures in a small

1209
00:48:56,960 --> 00:49:04,559
region so this is the ctim milon area

1210
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:07,680
and um and we put uh temperature loggers

1211
00:49:04,559 --> 00:49:12,160
on temperature sensors on Vine post with

1212
00:49:07,679 --> 00:49:15,679
data loggers and um in uh 100 points in

1213
00:49:12,159 --> 00:49:17,159
the area we measure uh temperatures uh

1214
00:49:15,679 --> 00:49:19,358
we just started we put his temperature

1215
00:49:17,159 --> 00:49:22,519
sensors in 2011 so the first year of

1216
00:49:19,358 --> 00:49:25,519
complete data was 201 12 and already in

1217
00:49:22,519 --> 00:49:29,079
2012 if we compute the hling index we

1218
00:49:25,519 --> 00:49:31,318
see there are quite some different es um

1219
00:49:29,079 --> 00:49:34,400
over this region in fact in such a small

1220
00:49:31,318 --> 00:49:37,960
area a s milon ug index ranges from

1221
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:40,400
almost 2,200 to almost

1222
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:43,199
2,400 which is 200 Degree Days

1223
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:44,599
difference in such a small area which is

1224
00:49:43,199 --> 00:49:46,598
significant but now still we have to

1225
00:49:44,599 --> 00:49:49,000
figure out which are the environmental

1226
00:49:46,599 --> 00:49:51,559
co-actors which are driving these

1227
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:53,079
temperature variables so in fact we are

1228
00:49:51,559 --> 00:49:55,680
we will use the same methodology as we

1229
00:49:53,079 --> 00:50:00,640
used for the whole border area with um

1230
00:49:55,679 --> 00:50:04,919
um Benjamin B but on a more refined uh

1231
00:50:00,639 --> 00:50:06,879
scale um for phology once you know uh

1232
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:09,280
the temperatures are driving phology and

1233
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:11,760
once you know how what is the spal

1234
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:14,559
variability of your temperatures then

1235
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:16,319
you can couple your temperature model

1236
00:50:14,559 --> 00:50:19,880
with the phology model and then you can

1237
00:50:16,318 --> 00:50:22,639
predict a special variability of phology

1238
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:24,920
so this is a projection of ver raisin

1239
00:50:22,639 --> 00:50:27,598
over the cenon area and you see that how

1240
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:33,838
ver raisin progresses over the area

1241
00:50:27,599 --> 00:50:35,760
August 8 August 9 August 10 August 11 so

1242
00:50:33,838 --> 00:50:39,119
takes about one week for ver raisin to

1243
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:42,000
be completed over the whole cilon area

1244
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:45,039
so we can predict special variability of

1245
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:47,119
phology over a wine growing regions

1246
00:50:45,039 --> 00:50:50,279
simply by coupling the temperature model

1247
00:50:47,119 --> 00:50:50,280
with the phenology

1248
00:50:51,318 --> 00:50:55,759
model 5

1249
00:50:53,519 --> 00:50:57,759
minutes okay some people may have to

1250
00:50:55,760 --> 00:51:00,480
leave okay yeah yeah feel free if you

1251
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:04,240
have to leave feel free I will try to do

1252
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:06,639
it as quickly as I can okay um so for

1253
00:51:04,239 --> 00:51:09,679
special variability of one of water

1254
00:51:06,639 --> 00:51:11,519
status you can use Delta 13 C you can

1255
00:51:09,679 --> 00:51:13,719
see here this is part of the shal blown

1256
00:51:11,519 --> 00:51:17,358
Vineyard you can see there's a very good

1257
00:51:13,719 --> 00:51:20,118
correspondence between the soil type and

1258
00:51:17,358 --> 00:51:24,000
the water deficit you the ranging fromus

1259
00:51:20,119 --> 00:51:24,000
22 to minus

1260
00:51:24,358 --> 00:51:31,039
26 nitrogen status so you can use yeast

1261
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:33,599
available nitrogen if you take enough uh

1262
00:51:31,039 --> 00:51:36,119
samples so here you have 10 samples per

1263
00:51:33,599 --> 00:51:38,000
Hector you can make very refined maps of

1264
00:51:36,119 --> 00:51:40,200
the nitrogen status of the vine so you

1265
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:42,719
see the yeast available nitrogen ranges

1266
00:51:40,199 --> 00:51:44,679
from 60 to 200 milligram per liter and

1267
00:51:42,719 --> 00:51:47,078
this gives you an exact idea of the

1268
00:51:44,679 --> 00:51:50,199
variability of the nitrogen status over

1269
00:51:47,079 --> 00:51:52,559
the estate even with intra block uh

1270
00:51:50,199 --> 00:51:54,798
differences just the the the finer the

1271
00:51:52,559 --> 00:51:56,640
GD your GD of sampling the more precise

1272
00:51:54,798 --> 00:51:59,679
map you will make so this simply

1273
00:51:56,639 --> 00:52:01,078
interpolating yeast available nitrogen

1274
00:51:59,679 --> 00:52:04,440
uh

1275
00:52:01,079 --> 00:52:07,280
data and um once you know all this well

1276
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:09,838
management to optimize ter expression is

1277
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:11,798
uh very easy you can use phology models

1278
00:52:09,838 --> 00:52:15,400
to choose the variety that will ripen in

1279
00:52:11,798 --> 00:52:18,239
the right window in your climatic

1280
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:21,760
situation optimize the level of water

1281
00:52:18,239 --> 00:52:24,118
deficit um if the climate is if your

1282
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:26,119
situation is very dry you can either use

1283
00:52:24,119 --> 00:52:29,358
draw resistant root stocks or Draw

1284
00:52:26,119 --> 00:52:32,079
resistant varieties you can select soils

1285
00:52:29,358 --> 00:52:34,279
with various soil water holding capacity

1286
00:52:32,079 --> 00:52:36,760
and if your climate is dry then you can

1287
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:38,680
compensate by choosing soils with high

1288
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:41,079
soil water holding capacity and in the

1289
00:52:38,679 --> 00:52:42,558
opposite if you have are in a wet

1290
00:52:41,079 --> 00:52:44,798
situation where the risk is that you

1291
00:52:42,559 --> 00:52:47,079
don't have enough water deficit you can

1292
00:52:44,798 --> 00:52:49,679
choose a soil with low soil water

1293
00:52:47,079 --> 00:52:51,760
holding capacity you can do yield

1294
00:52:49,679 --> 00:52:54,919
adjustments if you find phas water

1295
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:57,599
deficit they might be able to ripen uh

1296
00:52:54,920 --> 00:53:00,119
two tons per acre but not three or for

1297
00:52:57,599 --> 00:53:02,200
and um you can use irrigation if the

1298
00:53:00,119 --> 00:53:03,760
situation is too dry but with irrigation

1299
00:53:02,199 --> 00:53:06,759
you can only add water you cannot

1300
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:08,200
withdraw water and many situations

1301
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:10,520
people lose quality because they have

1302
00:53:08,199 --> 00:53:12,639
too much water not enough water deficit

1303
00:53:10,519 --> 00:53:14,679
I think worldwide you will lose as much

1304
00:53:12,639 --> 00:53:17,960
quality because of not enough water

1305
00:53:14,679 --> 00:53:20,639
deficit and because of too much water

1306
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:22,960
deficit to optimize a nitrogen status is

1307
00:53:20,639 --> 00:53:25,519
even easier you can if it's too low just

1308
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:27,079
fertilize either by mineral or by

1309
00:53:25,519 --> 00:53:29,440
organic fertilization

1310
00:53:27,079 --> 00:53:33,720
and if it's too high you can use cover

1311
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:38,480
crop to compete for nitrogen with the

1312
00:53:33,719 --> 00:53:40,519
vines so um well terar is reality just

1313
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:42,079
go to burgundy go to a seller generally

1314
00:53:40,519 --> 00:53:43,880
you're very well received you taste the

1315
00:53:42,079 --> 00:53:46,440
wines from the barrels and ask from

1316
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:48,519
which block they come and and and and

1317
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:49,838
well the vineyard management is the same

1318
00:53:48,519 --> 00:53:51,759
the wine making techniques are the same

1319
00:53:49,838 --> 00:53:53,318
so if there are difference is just only

1320
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:56,960
because the plots are located in

1321
00:53:53,318 --> 00:53:59,358
different uh situations

1322
00:53:56,960 --> 00:54:01,400
and the effect of climate in soil can be

1323
00:53:59,358 --> 00:54:03,719
explained just by basic Agronomy you

1324
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:05,760
don't have to look for some mystery

1325
00:54:03,719 --> 00:54:08,598
Roots going very deep and minerals

1326
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:11,559
transforming into Aromas it's just about

1327
00:54:08,599 --> 00:54:13,960
basic Agronomy about temperatures terrar

1328
00:54:11,559 --> 00:54:17,400
is about temperatures about phology

1329
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:17,400
about water status and about

1330
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:24,559
nitrogen um these factors can easily be

1331
00:54:21,519 --> 00:54:27,079
Quantified uh even with their special

1332
00:54:24,559 --> 00:54:28,440
variability and the output data from

1333
00:54:27,079 --> 00:54:31,400
these measurements can be used to

1334
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:34,400
optimize the expression through adapted

1335
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:37,280
management strategies be be the choice

1336
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:40,760
of the right variety the right root stop

1337
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:42,760
uh the use of cover crop or not um uh

1338
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:46,880
the use of techniques to cope with your

1339
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:50,240
with your water status or uh whatsoever

1340
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:53,440
okay so this was a very condensated talk

1341
00:54:50,239 --> 00:54:56,519
um we running in Bordeaux a course on

1342
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:58,639
terar uh in March so if you want to have

1343
00:54:56,519 --> 00:55:00,639
the same stuff spread out over one week

1344
00:54:58,639 --> 00:55:02,318
with more time for discussion come to

1345
00:55:00,639 --> 00:55:04,279
Bordeaux in March and then we will have

1346
00:55:02,318 --> 00:55:06,340
a little bit more time to discuss about

1347
00:55:04,280 --> 00:55:10,139
all thank you for your

1348
00:55:06,340 --> 00:55:10,139
[Applause]

1349
00:55:13,838 --> 00:55:19,920
attention yeah so uh you mentioned

1350
00:55:16,358 --> 00:55:22,960
climate technology and variability and

1351
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:25,159
you kind of convince me c WS a reality

1352
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:27,318
what about the reality of climate change

1353
00:55:25,159 --> 00:55:30,440
you kind of tipto around that I wonder

1354
00:55:27,318 --> 00:55:32,038
to what extent you see the industry for

1355
00:55:30,440 --> 00:55:35,599
example maybe thinking about using your

1356
00:55:32,039 --> 00:55:37,680
techology model to experiment IDE about

1357
00:55:35,599 --> 00:55:40,079
the variey or what's happening with the

1358
00:55:37,679 --> 00:55:42,118
industry a lot of research now on

1359
00:55:40,079 --> 00:55:45,160
climate change I have no time to talk

1360
00:55:42,119 --> 00:55:47,760
about in my talk but it's obvious that

1361
00:55:45,159 --> 00:55:50,879
if the timing of techology is so

1362
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:53,559
important in ter expression that when

1363
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:56,358
temperatures are rising the timing ofal

1364
00:55:53,559 --> 00:56:00,200
will be modified and this will this will

1365
00:55:56,358 --> 00:56:03,318
found affect uh pression because the

1366
00:56:00,199 --> 00:56:05,558
risk is that the the the varieties will

1367
00:56:03,318 --> 00:56:08,400
move out of the right which is for

1368
00:56:05,559 --> 00:56:11,079
instance already happening in bord

1369
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:14,639
with for bord

1370
00:56:11,079 --> 00:56:16,798
conditions General Harvest so when PL

1371
00:56:14,639 --> 00:56:19,358
between the 7th of September and the

1372
00:56:16,798 --> 00:56:22,519
15th of September and it's becoming more

1373
00:56:19,358 --> 00:56:24,639
and more early and w't we harvesting so

1374
00:56:22,519 --> 00:56:28,159
at the end of August definitely not

1375
00:56:24,639 --> 00:56:29,920
making our bestum BL those vages so one

1376
00:56:28,159 --> 00:56:32,199
possible adaptation to climate change is

1377
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:35,400
simply to change the varieties now to

1378
00:56:32,199 --> 00:56:38,159
find uh possibilities of delaying

1379
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:40,798
variety particular for early R Variety

1380
00:56:38,159 --> 00:56:45,798
which can be either changing the variety

1381
00:56:40,798 --> 00:56:49,038
or find any way to to to delay uh

1382
00:56:45,798 --> 00:56:52,639
phology for instance increase your jate

1383
00:56:49,039 --> 00:56:54,280
or prune later or using late lower cycle

1384
00:56:52,639 --> 00:56:58,239
root stops there are plenty of

1385
00:56:54,280 --> 00:56:58,240
possibilities but uh

1386
00:56:59,519 --> 00:57:04,119
it's important to to maintain the the

1387
00:57:02,318 --> 00:57:06,599
ripening in that

1388
00:57:04,119 --> 00:57:08,200
right this can be very easily modeled

1389
00:57:06,599 --> 00:57:11,079
because with those techology models you

1390
00:57:08,199 --> 00:57:13,719
can just add one de or 2 de or 3 de you

1391
00:57:11,079 --> 00:57:15,318
can exactly see when it will happen that

1392
00:57:13,719 --> 00:57:17,838
this or that variety will move out the

1393
00:57:15,318 --> 00:57:20,798
right right but these tools are very

1394
00:57:17,838 --> 00:57:24,199
adaptive to to study impact of climate

1395
00:57:20,798 --> 00:57:27,519
change and to adapt your practices to

1396
00:57:24,199 --> 00:57:29,199
maintain high quality production um in

1397
00:57:27,519 --> 00:57:31,480
your area another option is of course to

1398
00:57:29,199 --> 00:57:33,639
move out of the

1399
00:57:31,480 --> 00:57:36,079
area but generally Growers don't want to

1400
00:57:33,639 --> 00:57:36,078
move out of

1401
00:57:37,798 --> 00:57:44,119
there you just explained how that it was

1402
00:57:41,039 --> 00:57:48,680
important to take in consideration the

1403
00:57:44,119 --> 00:57:51,880
diversity of the water statue of each

1404
00:57:48,679 --> 00:57:53,078
region in the world so what do you think

1405
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:56,358
do you think

1406
00:57:53,079 --> 00:58:01,160
the uh water irrigation

1407
00:57:56,358 --> 00:58:03,400
uh respect your definition of the ter

1408
00:58:01,159 --> 00:58:06,239
you know what I mean uh for ter

1409
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:06,240
expression it's

1410
00:58:06,599 --> 00:58:13,559
op yes so the question was um um is it

1411
00:58:11,119 --> 00:58:17,519
possible to modify expression by

1412
00:58:13,559 --> 00:58:22,280
adapting your irrigation more s question

1413
00:58:17,519 --> 00:58:24,038
so um um to optimize the bar expression

1414
00:58:22,280 --> 00:58:26,160
particularly for breads for bries is a

1415
00:58:24,039 --> 00:58:29,440
little bit for making high quality red

1416
00:58:26,159 --> 00:58:33,239
that's the ideal situation situation of

1417
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:36,280
moderate water deficit and you

1418
00:58:33,239 --> 00:58:38,838
can my experience in Baux is that you

1419
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:41,000
can quite far far in terms of water

1420
00:58:38,838 --> 00:58:43,000
deficit that still produce high quality

1421
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:47,400
wies for those who are familiar with Mod

1422
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:50,519
potential measurements um in BAU we we

1423
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:55,480
consider it it's quite optimal to have -

1424
00:58:50,519 --> 00:58:58,159
1.3 - 1.4 even- 1.5 megapascal sto

1425
00:58:55,480 --> 00:59:02,519
potential and in pron we can go as down

1426
00:58:58,159 --> 00:59:06,719
as much as -.5 -.6 -7 still prod like

1427
00:59:02,519 --> 00:59:09,079
water there is definitely um um uh you

1428
00:59:06,719 --> 00:59:11,519
have to take into account your yield if

1429
00:59:09,079 --> 00:59:13,240
your CS face quite severe water deficit

1430
00:59:11,519 --> 00:59:15,239
stress you can still produce very high

1431
00:59:13,239 --> 00:59:17,159
quality with moderate yield but you

1432
00:59:15,239 --> 00:59:19,558
cannot combine severe water deficit

1433
00:59:17,159 --> 00:59:22,000
stress with high yield it's very easy to

1434
00:59:19,559 --> 00:59:24,319
understand water deficit will impact

1435
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:26,440
photosynthesis if photosynthesis limited

1436
00:59:24,318 --> 00:59:28,960
divines are no longer able to write B

1437
00:59:26,440 --> 00:59:30,960
crop so it depends also on your Target

1438
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:35,559
in terms of crops if your target is

1439
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:39,559
around 2 tons per acre uh then you

1440
00:59:35,559 --> 00:59:42,640
can go quite far in terms of now now of

1441
00:59:39,559 --> 00:59:46,000
course irrigation will modify the states

1442
00:59:42,639 --> 00:59:47,920
of your vs so it depends on where you

1443
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:51,199
are naturally without Irrigation in

1444
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:52,838
terms of defic if you are if there are

1445
00:59:51,199 --> 00:59:55,078
two risks to have not enough for the

1446
00:59:52,838 --> 00:59:57,440
deficit to have too much for the stress

1447
00:59:55,079 --> 00:59:59,039
if your risk that you have not in water

1448
00:59:57,440 --> 01:00:01,599
deficit which is in fact the case in

1449
00:59:59,039 --> 01:00:03,079
many many M regions around the world the

1450
01:00:01,599 --> 01:00:05,160
point is that people are not aware about

1451
01:00:03,079 --> 01:00:07,000
it because if you have not enough to

1452
01:00:05,159 --> 01:00:08,879
grow high quality grapes your VES are

1453
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:10,679
looking very nice they are green they

1454
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:12,798
produce and then at the end the result

1455
01:00:10,679 --> 01:00:15,558
of disappointment but people do not

1456
01:00:12,798 --> 01:00:17,838
connect it necessarily to the problem of

1457
01:00:15,559 --> 01:00:19,640
not enough water deficit if you have too

1458
01:00:17,838 --> 01:00:22,639
much water deficit very easy to see it

1459
01:00:19,639 --> 01:00:24,759
when your BS well before the bble you

1460
01:00:22,639 --> 01:00:26,480
will be a way of course if the risk is

1461
01:00:24,760 --> 01:00:28,520
that we have too much stress then

1462
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:30,440
irrigation is option because you can

1463
01:00:28,519 --> 01:00:32,358
bring your minds back into the right

1464
01:00:30,440 --> 01:00:36,280
window of water deficit stress but if

1465
01:00:32,358 --> 01:00:39,038
you have not enough water deficit stress

1466
01:00:36,280 --> 01:00:42,440
is have a question

1467
01:00:39,039 --> 01:00:42,440
Geneva we have a

1468
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:50,838
question so

1469
01:00:47,880 --> 01:00:54,358
question do the white lines show the

1470
01:00:50,838 --> 01:00:56,480
same relation to water deficit as the

1471
01:00:54,358 --> 01:00:58,920
red lines no

1472
01:00:56,480 --> 01:01:01,199
you need less water deficit for whes

1473
01:00:58,920 --> 01:01:02,680
than for Reds because water deficit is

1474
01:01:01,199 --> 01:01:05,960
very

1475
01:01:02,679 --> 01:01:08,318
important to have PHX in your grapes and

1476
01:01:05,960 --> 01:01:10,240
for red wine you definitely need PHX

1477
01:01:08,318 --> 01:01:12,318
it's it's very difficult to have grapes

1478
01:01:10,239 --> 01:01:14,399
with high levels of PHX without water

1479
01:01:12,318 --> 01:01:16,480
deficit but for wides you're more

1480
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:19,440
focusing on Aroma compounds if you don't

1481
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:22,719
want too much uh PHX in your in your

1482
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:24,720
Graves so definitely you should grow

1483
01:01:22,719 --> 01:01:27,199
white grapes with less water deficit

1484
01:01:24,719 --> 01:01:31,038
than red grapes this can also be a very

1485
01:01:27,199 --> 01:01:33,639
interesting tool to um optimize the

1486
01:01:31,039 --> 01:01:36,319
terar expression in your vard because

1487
01:01:33,639 --> 01:01:39,118
generally in a in an estate you have

1488
01:01:36,318 --> 01:01:41,679
deep soils with uh High soil water

1489
01:01:39,119 --> 01:01:43,480
holding capacity and shallow soils with

1490
01:01:41,679 --> 01:01:45,558
low water holding capacity now if you

1491
01:01:43,480 --> 01:01:47,559
plant your Reds on your shallow soils

1492
01:01:45,559 --> 01:01:49,119
and your whites your deep soils then you

1493
01:01:47,559 --> 01:01:52,240
naturally will have less water deficit

1494
01:01:49,119 --> 01:01:54,119
on your whites and more R so it's a very

1495
01:01:52,239 --> 01:01:57,038
interesting way to optimize the r

1496
01:01:54,119 --> 01:01:59,079
expression but many do Bo out they grow

1497
01:01:57,039 --> 01:02:00,680
their VES and their deep soils before

1498
01:01:59,079 --> 01:02:01,920
water and their Reds of the gravity so

1499
01:02:00,679 --> 01:02:05,480
and the

1500
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:08,400
CH I think a very typical reason why

1501
01:02:05,480 --> 01:02:10,519
it's why our whites do really well here

1502
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:13,680
in our deep soils with a lot of water ho

1503
01:02:10,519 --> 01:02:16,838
capacity and it's

1504
01:02:13,679 --> 01:02:20,159
much okay um I've been told we need to

1505
01:02:16,838 --> 01:02:23,000
move on so fortunately we'll have to it

1506
01:02:20,159 --> 01:02:24,899
off here but if you have other questions

1507
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:28,059
again thank you very much

1508
