1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,760
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:06,759 --> 00:00:11,039
University my name is Tom Whitlow I'm a

3
00:00:09,279 --> 00:00:15,279
faculty member in the horiculture

4
00:00:11,039 --> 00:00:17,038
section of sips and today we're going to

5
00:00:15,279 --> 00:00:19,399
be doing some trash

6
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:23,080
talking

7
00:00:19,399 --> 00:00:25,839
um as many of you may know the for

8
00:00:23,079 --> 00:00:28,439
sustainability committee started uh

9
00:00:25,839 --> 00:00:30,839
about the first year beginning of

10
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:35,520
classes this past spring

11
00:00:30,839 --> 00:00:38,519
and it was catalyzed by our own faculty

12
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:43,280
colleague Jane Mount Pleasant when she

13
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:46,359
realized how much junk there was and I I

14
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:49,760
say junk or trash but how much reusable

15
00:00:46,359 --> 00:00:52,320
or recyclable or compostable things we

16
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:55,679
produced at all of our meetings and it

17
00:00:52,320 --> 00:01:00,920
was basically just going into uh a

18
00:00:55,679 --> 00:01:04,640
landfill so Jane convened a stainability

19
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:06,519
committee and over the past 9 months or

20
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,879
so we've been trying to encourage

21
00:01:06,519 --> 00:01:12,920
everyone to do things like bring their

22
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:15,640
own utensils to events like this and

23
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:21,240
bring your own cups to put coffee in and

24
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:23,840
so forth um the really big challenge

25
00:01:21,239 --> 00:01:27,759
that's facing the committee and I would

26
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:31,439
suggest maybe Cornell as well right now

27
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:34,959
is upscaling our composting operation

28
00:01:31,438 --> 00:01:37,279
composting happens but it's very

29
00:01:34,959 --> 00:01:40,438
difficult to make it really efficient

30
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:44,239
and we've got multiple sources multiple

31
00:01:40,438 --> 00:01:46,758
kinds of stuff and many of our local

32
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:49,118
composting or smaller scale local

33
00:01:46,759 --> 00:01:53,118
composting operations don't accept all

34
00:01:49,118 --> 00:01:56,799
this stuff so our composting or our

35
00:01:53,118 --> 00:01:59,159
sustainability committee uh decided that

36
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:00,600
we patch everybody at the beginning

37
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:05,240
close to the beginning

38
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:08,439
semester and talk about Waste Management

39
00:02:05,239 --> 00:02:11,038
with Broadley at Cornell and how it

40
00:02:08,439 --> 00:02:12,878
works and how we can make it work better

41
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:15,559
this is going to be a tag team

42
00:02:12,878 --> 00:02:18,919
presentation our first presenter is

43
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:22,199
going to be Jane Mount Pleasant and I I

44
00:02:18,919 --> 00:02:24,159
don't have any cool pictures from fourth

45
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:28,079
grade or anything like that or any of

46
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:30,199
these people but um rest assured I think

47
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,920
that they will all have their their own

48
00:02:30,199 --> 00:02:34,679
entertaining and

49
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:38,119
elucidating things to to show us today

50
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:42,319
so we we're going to be uh treated to

51
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:45,519
Talks by Jane by three graduate students

52
00:02:42,318 --> 00:02:46,679
uh anakah Huber Isabelle branstrom and

53
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:49,120
Wana

54
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:51,800
mun and they're going to be talking

55
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:55,480
about different aspects of

56
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:55,480
way so

57
00:02:57,239 --> 00:03:03,519
J thank you thank you very much much Tom

58
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:05,640
for that very nice um introduction but I

59
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:07,319
do want to say that it's mostly The

60
00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:09,559
Graduate students that have been doing

61
00:03:07,318 --> 00:03:12,000
the Lion Share of this work and I'm

62
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:15,519
really grateful to to be working with

63
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,519
them um we are going to talk about waste

64
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:21,599
management at for now um one of the

65
00:03:18,519 --> 00:03:24,080
first things is how much waste do we

66
00:03:21,598 --> 00:03:28,280
generate and it is a pretty um

67
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:31,439
mindboggling term over 21,000 tons in

68
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:34,400
2014 and you can see that compost is

69
00:03:31,438 --> 00:03:37,400
about 40% of that the next big thing is

70
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:42,599
our kind of commonly understood recycle

71
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:45,200
and reuse and over 20% ends up in

72
00:03:42,598 --> 00:03:48,359
landfill but when we look at these big

73
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:50,798
numbers how much is a ton um a lot of us

74
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:53,400
have a hard time visualizing it well

75
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:56,239
this is what a ton of landfill waste

76
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:58,719
looks like at least the volume right and

77
00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:00,239
the weight right so you kind of get an

78
00:03:58,719 --> 00:04:02,639
idea of what you know

79
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:04,480
21,000 you know elephants that's an

80
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:07,199
awful lot of stuff that we're throwing

81
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:10,078
into the land was but let's go back and

82
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:13,479
look a little bit more at our overall

83
00:04:10,079 --> 00:04:17,000
waste um a large portion of it is

84
00:04:13,479 --> 00:04:19,478
actually compost and about almost 90% is

85
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,600
plant and animal waste right um animal

86
00:04:19,478 --> 00:04:25,279
waste being animal um waste from our our

87
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:28,080
farm operations and plant waste can come

88
00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:32,679
from all over campus food scraps make up

89
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:32,680
only about 12 um percent of

90
00:04:33,079 --> 00:04:39,519
that in terms of recycling and reusing

91
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:42,360
we have close to 3,000 tons um the

92
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:44,198
biggest um chunk is what we commonly

93
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:46,759
call single string this is the stuff

94
00:04:44,199 --> 00:04:50,478
that we put in it's the recycle paper

95
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:54,240
and recycle plastic and that's about 50%

96
00:04:50,478 --> 00:04:57,719
yard waste also makes up another big um

97
00:04:54,240 --> 00:05:00,319
uh you know component this ends up um

98
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:04,880
being turned into mulch that's uh used

99
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:08,719
by grounds on on um you know Pathways

100
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:13,399
and and on garden beds surprisingly

101
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:16,199
scrap metal is 9% electronic scrap 5%

102
00:05:13,399 --> 00:05:19,038
and used furniture about

103
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:24,120
2% we have an other category which is

104
00:05:19,038 --> 00:05:27,560
over 100 tons surprisingly here used oil

105
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:31,959
whether it's cooking oil or motor and

106
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:37,199
pump oil right use cooking oil oil um

107
00:05:31,959 --> 00:05:38,719
54% use motor oil 22% batteries 12% and

108
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:42,160
tires

109
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:46,160
12% so who's in charge of all

110
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:48,600
this Cornell University's R5 operations

111
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:50,520
and waste management and we are just

112
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:53,160
delighted this morning to have two

113
00:05:50,519 --> 00:05:55,000
representatives of that group here with

114
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:59,960
us this is

115
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:03,240
springbot and George W and if if you

116
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:05,519
ever want to have wanted to be a groupy

117
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:09,120
these are folks you want to tail around

118
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:11,639
because they really do great stuff um

119
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:14,879
and we should all know who they are and

120
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:17,598
and be very um admiring of them this is

121
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:20,038
their website anything you want to know

122
00:06:17,598 --> 00:06:23,120
about waste at Cornell you can probably

123
00:06:20,038 --> 00:06:26,199
find it on this

124
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:29,598
website so here they are spring and

125
00:06:26,199 --> 00:06:32,000
George and they're always thinking about

126
00:06:29,598 --> 00:06:34,639
how to do a better job of managing waste

127
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:37,639
at we now so where does all of our waste

128
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:41,319
go well the landfill waste which is a

129
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:44,000
huge amount over 3,000 tons Cella which

130
00:06:41,319 --> 00:06:46,919
is a a local company uh takes it to

131
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:50,839
senica metal landfill up in watervue New

132
00:06:46,918 --> 00:06:53,918
York and this is a 400 acre um operation

133
00:06:50,839 --> 00:06:58,159
um that is at the North End of kind of

134
00:06:53,918 --> 00:07:00,758
ugan and senica lakes we also um our

135
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:04,639
compost is done on site on campus this

136
00:07:00,759 --> 00:07:07,560
is Farm Services um does this and it's a

137
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:09,360
it's a commercial size operation we also

138
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:12,280
have an Institute the Cornell Waste

139
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:15,960
Management Institute at Cornell um does

140
00:07:12,279 --> 00:07:18,839
research on all aspects of composting

141
00:07:15,959 --> 00:07:21,638
both um looking at you know commercial

142
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:24,839
stuff looking how to compost dairy cows

143
00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:27,560
and and um and dead deer that they find

144
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:30,918
on the on the road um they offer all

145
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:32,598
sorts of services to ciens pounds across

146
00:07:30,918 --> 00:07:35,079
the country maybe I don't know this New

147
00:07:32,598 --> 00:07:37,800
York State about how to do a better job

148
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:40,240
of composting our single stream recycle

149
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:43,360
goes to townkins County salad waste

150
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:47,439
scrap metal a bunch of different vendors

151
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:50,080
um electronic scrap Sun King inport New

152
00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:53,038
York reused Furniture who would have

153
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:55,758
ever thought 57 tons uh some of it goes

154
00:07:53,038 --> 00:07:58,680
into a public auction at Cornell we have

155
00:07:55,759 --> 00:08:01,639
a used furniture inventory and a Cornell

156
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:04,000
assets transfer program where if

157
00:08:01,639 --> 00:08:06,478
departments or units colleges have

158
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,959
excess Furniture there's ways to find

159
00:08:06,478 --> 00:08:12,519
out if other units or colleges can use

160
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:16,478
it um and so we don't end up taking it

161
00:08:12,519 --> 00:08:18,959
to the um to the landfill we also give

162
00:08:16,478 --> 00:08:21,560
stuff to community reuse programs and

163
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:23,680
then finally dump and run this is the

164
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:26,280
program um that in the spring when

165
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:30,759
students are are moving out in the the

166
00:08:26,279 --> 00:08:32,679
spring term um they can um

167
00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:35,320
collect all of their excess furniture

168
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:38,759
and clothing and appliances and just

169
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:40,760
unbelievable things it's stored sorted

170
00:08:38,759 --> 00:08:43,559
and stored over summer and then in

171
00:08:40,759 --> 00:08:45,639
August the first weekend when uh Cornell

172
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:49,319
students come back particularly first

173
00:08:45,639 --> 00:08:53,838
year students um they can then buy these

174
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:56,278
um these items um and it avoids um

175
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:57,560
putting them in into the landfill if

176
00:08:56,278 --> 00:08:59,559
you're wondering what happens to the

177
00:08:57,559 --> 00:09:01,599
cooking oil it goes to National oil

178
00:08:59,559 --> 00:09:03,919
recycling in North Rose New York they

179
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:07,440
use motor and pump oil to York

180
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:10,679
Pennsylvania mattresses they get reused

181
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:13,560
at University of sleep podest right um 8

182
00:09:10,679 --> 00:09:17,799
tons of wood pellets go to a company in

183
00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:21,559
Syracuse batteries 7 tons to a national

184
00:09:17,799 --> 00:09:23,120
outfit called nlr tires Cella

185
00:09:21,559 --> 00:09:27,278
distributes them to companies to make

186
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:31,360
into athletic tur Turf and and beding

187
00:09:27,278 --> 00:09:31,360
mulch that's not Munch but mulch

188
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:36,480
there were new compost rules that

189
00:09:33,879 --> 00:09:39,360
started August 15th and the new rules on

190
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:41,159
the Cornell campus say food scraps only

191
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:44,440
the only thing you can put in our yellow

192
00:09:41,159 --> 00:09:46,559
compost um bins are food scraps and you

193
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:49,760
might say hi so many other things will

194
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:53,239
compost right well the problem um is

195
00:09:49,759 --> 00:09:55,480
contamination and our dining halls and

196
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:58,959
um everybody who tries to compost on a

197
00:09:55,480 --> 00:10:01,320
large scale has a problem with um people

198
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:06,078
who throw things in there um that

199
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:07,920
shouldn't be composted um so for example

200
00:10:06,078 --> 00:10:10,719
what we're now saying is things like the

201
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:14,278
compostable cups and even things like

202
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:16,000
paper cups that say ecotainer and paper

203
00:10:14,278 --> 00:10:18,320
plates that you might think would be

204
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:22,440
compostable and all that wonderful

205
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:25,160
compostable plastic wear no it cannot go

206
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:28,399
into compost why because it doesn't

207
00:10:25,159 --> 00:10:31,199
really compost um and this is from uh

208
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:33,879
senica compost and what you see is just

209
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:36,519
tons of stuff that's in their compost

210
00:10:33,879 --> 00:10:38,399
that doesn't break down right so what's

211
00:10:36,519 --> 00:10:41,000
the solution to this well if we keep

212
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:43,078
doing it uh senica compost and other

213
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,839
companies that do compost they just

214
00:10:43,078 --> 00:10:48,559
refuse to take it so Cornell dining is

215
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:51,600
stuck with the compostable materials

216
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:56,078
what to do with it right so the solution

217
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:59,680
is cornal is no longer accepting um

218
00:10:56,078 --> 00:11:01,958
things like the the silverware

219
00:10:59,679 --> 00:11:08,519
don't put it but Jane the Compost

220
00:11:01,958 --> 00:11:08,518
Facility out on St Road doesn't take

221
00:11:08,839 --> 00:11:15,079
dining they do so this is it's the same

222
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:16,839
it doesn't matter nobody takes it

223
00:11:15,078 --> 00:11:20,399
because it doesn't

224
00:11:16,839 --> 00:11:23,720
compost right so if you do food scraps

225
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:25,759
at home and it goes through through um

226
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:30,720
Tomkins County food straps which goes to

227
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:30,720
kuga compost they won't take it e

228
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:36,679
all right so we know how Cornell does it

229
00:11:34,039 --> 00:11:39,480
and now the question is well why should

230
00:11:36,679 --> 00:11:42,319
we really care about this and how do we

231
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:45,000
um compare with other countries and

232
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:46,399
other parts of us and I'm turning it

233
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:50,200
over to

234
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:53,120
my an so in the next few minutes I would

235
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:54,720
like to talk how um yeah the waste

236
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:57,519
management or the numbers we just heard

237
00:11:54,720 --> 00:12:00,839
about compared to the rest of the

238
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:03,039
US and I would like to start with this

239
00:12:00,839 --> 00:12:07,000
table and this table

240
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:10,199
summarize um the proportion of waste

241
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:12,919
which is properly disposed and it shows

242
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:16,399
the numbers from All Over America in

243
00:12:12,919 --> 00:12:20,639
2012 and I would like to point out two

244
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:20,639
numbers the first

245
00:12:22,519 --> 00:12:27,759
number are the Plastics we produce on an

246
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:30,760
everyday basis and we can see here that

247
00:12:27,759 --> 00:12:33,519
only 88.8% % are actually propably

248
00:12:30,759 --> 00:12:37,399
disposed this means the other

249
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:38,799
92% um end on landfills and the same is

250
00:12:37,399 --> 00:12:43,159
here with the food

251
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:46,319
scraps only 4.8% of all food scraps get

252
00:12:43,159 --> 00:12:50,198
ends up in composting facilities this

253
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:52,519
means 95% of all Organics end up either

254
00:12:50,198 --> 00:12:55,439
in a landfill or get GR in an

255
00:12:52,519 --> 00:12:57,240
incinerator and I was very uh surprised

256
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:59,760
and shocked by these low numbers because

257
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:03,440
it would be very easy for us

258
00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:03,439
just to compost

259
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:12,199
properly so how is this just a reminder

260
00:13:07,799 --> 00:13:15,919
relate to Cornell so in Corell

261
00:13:12,198 --> 00:13:17,359
79% of all our waste goes either in

262
00:13:15,919 --> 00:13:20,519
recycling or

263
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:22,680
composting and in comparison to Canal

264
00:13:20,519 --> 00:13:29,560
the United States only

265
00:13:22,679 --> 00:13:31,679
35% of our way gets probably U disposed

266
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:34,239
but why does it matter if Organics end

267
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:38,399
up on a landfill or a composting

268
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:40,480
facility and the issue is when we or the

269
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:42,639
normal process in a composting facility

270
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:46,240
is if you put Organics uh displace

271
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:48,560
Organics in um composting facilities

272
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:51,320
then they get decomposed under aerobic

273
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:53,638
conditions and CO2 is released and this

274
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:55,440
C2 is part of the natur natural

275
00:13:53,639 --> 00:13:58,320
short-term carbon

276
00:13:55,440 --> 00:14:01,120
cycle however if you put it on in a

277
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:05,680
landfill the conditions there are

278
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:08,039
anerobic and this means next to CO2 also

279
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:11,239
methan and nitrous oxide are produced

280
00:14:08,039 --> 00:14:14,120
and these are very bad Greenhouse G

281
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:15,399
gases and how bad they actually are you

282
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:19,000
can see here in this

283
00:14:15,399 --> 00:14:21,679
table um it shows the global warming uh

284
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:24,480
potential of greenal gases and under

285
00:14:21,679 --> 00:14:27,000
global warming potential we understand

286
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:31,600
potential of a given greenhous gas in

287
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:33,399
comparison to um car dioxide and methan

288
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:39,480
it methane is

289
00:14:33,399 --> 00:14:43,799
25% worse and not 25 times um verse and

290
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:46,839
nitrous oxide actually around 300

291
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:49,958
times and this actually results then in

292
00:14:46,839 --> 00:14:52,000
this chart these are us greenal G

293
00:14:49,958 --> 00:14:55,599
emissions from Waste Management streames

294
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:59,240
in the US from 1990 to

295
00:14:55,600 --> 00:15:02,120
2014 and the um y ex's shows um the

296
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:05,320
emissions in million metric tons of

297
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:07,639
carbon dioxide equivalent and we can see

298
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:10,199
that the majority of greenhouse gases

299
00:15:07,639 --> 00:15:13,399
comes from landfill that's because it's

300
00:15:10,198 --> 00:15:17,758
anerobic it's followed by wastewater

301
00:15:13,399 --> 00:15:19,600
treatment by around 15 to 20% and it's

302
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:22,240
uh and so much because it's also

303
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:24,440
happening under anerobic conditions and

304
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:27,560
then composting actually has a tiny

305
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:29,920
fraction of it so when we and when we

306
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:32,000
now just look at the meth in production

307
00:15:29,919 --> 00:15:35,639
uh emissions from

308
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:38,519
landfills it's 22%

309
00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:42,759
20.2% and that's is the third largest

310
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:42,759
source of methan emitted in the

311
00:15:43,198 --> 00:15:50,078
US um yeah now I give you all the

312
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:51,919
numbers but when we actually look at the

313
00:15:50,078 --> 00:15:54,479
percentage of the greenhouse gases which

314
00:15:51,919 --> 00:15:56,559
are emitted from the waste screens in

315
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:59,959
comparison to all the emitted greenhouse

316
00:15:56,559 --> 00:16:02,719
gases it only makes 2

317
00:15:59,958 --> 00:16:04,439
.5% so this number is Tiny and probably

318
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:07,560
you think why should we care it's

319
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:11,519
special tiny percentage however however

320
00:16:07,559 --> 00:16:15,239
every penny counts and actually these

321
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:18,039
2.5% are very easy to be reduced and

322
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:21,720
everyone of us can contribute by yeah

323
00:16:18,039 --> 00:16:24,240
deciding on composting to make it happen

324
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:26,920
so and that I can over

325
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:30,278
to

326
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:34,000
Okay so talking specifically about

327
00:16:30,278 --> 00:16:35,919
Cornell we know that 75% of the waste is

328
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:41,159
not taken to the landfill but keep in

329
00:16:35,919 --> 00:16:44,159
mind that this includes manure and uh um

330
00:16:41,159 --> 00:16:47,759
pruning waste and obviously nobody sends

331
00:16:44,159 --> 00:16:49,078
that to the so we can do a lot better

332
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:52,039
than that

333
00:16:49,078 --> 00:16:54,838
still and one of the things that we want

334
00:16:52,039 --> 00:16:57,439
you to take with you today is that

335
00:16:54,839 --> 00:17:00,480
recycling is great for many reasons but

336
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:02,519
it is not going to Sol our problems so

337
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:05,919
granted recycling can reduce waste and

338
00:17:02,519 --> 00:17:08,720
to landfills and in incinerators sorry

339
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:11,640
um for many products it results in a lot

340
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:13,720
less energy needed to produce new things

341
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:16,880
in comparison to using raw or virgin

342
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:19,759
materials it creates jobs we all love to

343
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:21,400
create jobs and they can also be the

344
00:17:19,759 --> 00:17:25,119
Recycled products can also be sold to

345
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:27,798
other end users for cheaper than the raw

346
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:29,119
material and um depending on the

347
00:17:27,798 --> 00:17:31,679
material that we're talking about

348
00:17:29,119 --> 00:17:34,119
recycling can save energy when processed

349
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:37,240
into new material into new things from

350
00:17:34,119 --> 00:17:40,319
recycled materials so you can see here

351
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:43,160
uh materials like glass not a huge

352
00:17:40,319 --> 00:17:45,519
energy save but aluminum cans and a

353
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:47,480
copper wire are way more

354
00:17:45,519 --> 00:17:50,279
significant if we're talking about

355
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:52,038
reduction in greenhouse gas emissions we

356
00:17:50,279 --> 00:17:55,240
can see things like copper wire steel

357
00:17:52,038 --> 00:17:57,839
cans and certain Plastics can really

358
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:59,880
help in reducing the um greenhouse gas

359
00:17:57,839 --> 00:18:03,279
emissions associated with making things

360
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:05,440
from new Plastics however things like

361
00:18:03,279 --> 00:18:07,599
office paper which we do consume a lot

362
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:10,240
of and normally think oh we'll just

363
00:18:07,599 --> 00:18:12,279
recycle it and it's okay it actually

364
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:14,159
takes it produces greenhouse gases to

365
00:18:12,279 --> 00:18:15,839
recycle paper so that's something that

366
00:18:14,159 --> 00:18:18,120
we need to

367
00:18:15,839 --> 00:18:19,599
start and then this was the biggest

368
00:18:18,119 --> 00:18:21,639
finding for me which should not have

369
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:24,038
been surprising but it was really

370
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:26,679
shocking for me to to read that

371
00:18:24,038 --> 00:18:29,839
recycling is actually really expensive

372
00:18:26,679 --> 00:18:31,919
and if we talk about only money it costs

373
00:18:29,839 --> 00:18:34,519
the city a lot of money to recycle

374
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:37,880
things usually because it implies

375
00:18:34,519 --> 00:18:39,679
Transportation storage storing a lot of

376
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:42,720
Labor and

377
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:45,360
unfortunately things like cheap oil

378
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:47,319
prices and really expensive labor

379
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:50,079
contribut to it not being very

380
00:18:47,319 --> 00:18:53,839
sustainable to recycl so this comes from

381
00:18:50,079 --> 00:18:56,839
a paper which is actually the only paper

382
00:18:53,839 --> 00:19:00,079
that I found that actually analyzes

383
00:18:56,839 --> 00:19:03,158
recycling as a

384
00:19:00,079 --> 00:19:05,839
um from an economic standpoint and what

385
00:19:03,159 --> 00:19:08,919
they found was that if Society recycles

386
00:19:05,839 --> 00:19:11,798
10% of its waste and if that 10% of its

387
00:19:08,919 --> 00:19:14,640
waste is majority metal it's actually a

388
00:19:11,798 --> 00:19:17,240
good thing but the more the higher the

389
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:20,120
proportion of the recycling that happens

390
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:22,000
the more expensive it is for the city

391
00:19:20,119 --> 00:19:23,959
and for society in general to do this

392
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Recycling and keep in mind that if we

393
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:29,159
are in certain places like the United

394
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,159
States of America all this recycled

395
00:19:29,159 --> 00:19:33,720
product also gets transported to places

396
00:19:31,159 --> 00:19:36,039
like China to be processed so there's a

397
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:37,960
huge cost to recycling that we don't

398
00:19:36,038 --> 00:19:40,158
really see and then we need to start

399
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:43,319
thinking about

400
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:45,919
it so we found this cartoon which we

401
00:19:43,319 --> 00:19:49,119
thought was hilarious reference to the

402
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:52,120
Titanic we don't get that

403
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:54,319
from even though we don't see the trash

404
00:19:52,119 --> 00:19:55,879
it is always there and I want to share

405
00:19:54,319 --> 00:19:59,399
with you a story that I thought about

406
00:19:55,880 --> 00:20:03,520
this morning um a couple of years in my

407
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:06,080
hometown tiny little city called boot

408
00:20:03,519 --> 00:20:09,079
Columbia around 7 million people were

409
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:11,960
there there was um political crisis that

410
00:20:09,079 --> 00:20:14,158
led to trash not being picked up and so

411
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:15,798
all of a sudden these spoiled people

412
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:17,919
that got their trash picked up three

413
00:20:15,798 --> 00:20:19,279
times a week were not getting their

414
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:21,120
trash picked up they would still put it

415
00:20:19,279 --> 00:20:23,519
out on the street but nobody was picking

416
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:26,158
it up and within two weeks people

417
00:20:23,519 --> 00:20:28,319
started writing about how they never saw

418
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:30,760
their trash and seeing their trash for

419
00:20:28,319 --> 00:20:32,960
the first time and smelling it and

420
00:20:30,759 --> 00:20:35,440
seeing what comes with it was a really

421
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:38,038
huge lesson to us and maybe we should

422
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:40,640
start cutting down on

423
00:20:38,038 --> 00:20:44,240
trash so the big takeaway from the

424
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:48,200
seminar we want is for you guys all of

425
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:50,120
us to reduce it's the big big first R

426
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:53,679
right and we should start thinking about

427
00:20:50,119 --> 00:20:56,319
it more and reduce usually means buying

428
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:58,038
less but then we know it's hard

429
00:20:56,319 --> 00:21:00,720
sometimes you can't do sometimes you

430
00:20:58,038 --> 00:21:02,519
just can't afford to not buy the sixpack

431
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:05,679
of peppers at webman that comes in that

432
00:21:02,519 --> 00:21:08,359
awful non-recyclable bag so maybe we

433
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:11,519
should try to reuse and instead of

434
00:21:08,359 --> 00:21:14,319
coming up with new uh plastic

435
00:21:11,519 --> 00:21:16,558
baggies we should try to rec reuse the

436
00:21:14,319 --> 00:21:19,038
ones we already have and then finally we

437
00:21:16,558 --> 00:21:21,440
can still optimize recycling as anuka

438
00:21:19,038 --> 00:21:23,798
pointed out only 8% of the plastic ends

439
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:27,120
up in recycling so we can definitely do

440
00:21:23,798 --> 00:21:30,200
better and then of course if you want to

441
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:31,719
bring reusable to your picnics we

442
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:34,120
totally support

443
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:36,000
that so there's a lot of stuff happening

444
00:21:34,119 --> 00:21:38,319
on campus that we may not see just

445
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,960
because it is not in every room with the

446
00:21:38,319 --> 00:21:44,000
normal blue recycling bins but we have

447
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:45,840
plastic bag and film recycling which you

448
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,480
have to go up to the plant signs loading

449
00:21:45,839 --> 00:21:50,158
dock or to the mail room to climb but

450
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:52,200
they're there we also have composting we

451
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:54,520
have battery recycling and electronics

452
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:56,080
recycling which sometimes you don't see

453
00:21:54,519 --> 00:21:59,038
like I said you have to go search for

454
00:21:56,079 --> 00:22:01,439
them so the only two places I know our

455
00:21:59,038 --> 00:22:03,839
Helen Newman and Rice hall where you can

456
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:05,720
actually leave your old mouse that

457
00:22:03,839 --> 00:22:08,439
doesn't work and your battery charger

458
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:10,640
that broke down and then there's also

459
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:13,558
really cool initiatives going on mostly

460
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:16,360
led by students the Corell environmental

461
00:22:13,558 --> 00:22:18,158
collaborative theyo by Eco is actually

462
00:22:16,359 --> 00:22:20,038
this huge group that gathers all the

463
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:23,080
organizations on campus that do

464
00:22:20,038 --> 00:22:24,720
environmentally focused activities and

465
00:22:23,079 --> 00:22:26,519
then there's also the cornal food

466
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:28,679
recovery Network which I did not know

467
00:22:26,519 --> 00:22:30,519
about and I thought absolutely brilliant

468
00:22:28,679 --> 00:22:32,240
they go to the dining halls and they

469
00:22:30,519 --> 00:22:33,918
repackage the fruit the food that's

470
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:36,679
already been prepared and then

471
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:38,960
distribute it to the food pantries

472
00:22:36,679 --> 00:22:42,640
through the

473
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:42,640
Friendship donations

474
00:22:42,759 --> 00:22:47,200
Network and if you want to go beyond

475
00:22:45,159 --> 00:22:50,960
Cornell there's other stuff that we can

476
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:53,360
all do so like we've already probably

477
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:56,038
told you a million times bring your own

478
00:22:53,359 --> 00:22:57,959
cup Cutlery in place to seminar and

479
00:22:56,038 --> 00:23:00,400
coffee break and you start doing it for

480
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:02,038
lunch every day that'd be great um

481
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:04,919
there's also a great opportunity to

482
00:23:02,038 --> 00:23:06,919
teach people so I had the experience

483
00:23:04,919 --> 00:23:09,440
during Apple fest where I told somebody

484
00:23:06,919 --> 00:23:13,000
that his cider cup was not compostable

485
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:16,159
and he was totally heartbroken but I

486
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:17,720
taught him um we all see it happening

487
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:19,840
around campus all the time people just

488
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:21,600
don't pay attention and they just toss

489
00:23:19,839 --> 00:23:23,879
their bottles or their can in the first

490
00:23:21,599 --> 00:23:26,119
stand they come across and it's just a

491
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:27,520
matter of saying to that person hey

492
00:23:26,119 --> 00:23:29,439
maybe you should pay attention there's a

493
00:23:27,519 --> 00:23:32,240
recycling B that's

494
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:33,960
store um I found this recently and I

495
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:36,798
thought it was really cool you can opt

496
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:39,519
out of receiving junk mail and cataloges

497
00:23:36,798 --> 00:23:41,359
you don't have to ask for junk mail in

498
00:23:39,519 --> 00:23:43,319
catalog but apparently you can tell them

499
00:23:41,359 --> 00:23:46,000
that you don't want it cuz that makes

500
00:23:43,319 --> 00:23:47,918
more sense so if you go to this website

501
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,200
they take care of all the actual

502
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:52,080
contacting for you you just enter your

503
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:54,640
address and tell them you don't want

504
00:23:52,079 --> 00:23:56,639
it and then I figured I would throw this

505
00:23:54,640 --> 00:24:00,440
in we can all Drive less and walk a

506
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:00,440
little bit more maybe even more

507
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:05,519
so we've also set up this uh email

508
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:07,880
account and we're hoping to become a

509
00:24:05,519 --> 00:24:10,158
resource for everybody on waste related

510
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:12,080
things so if you have any questions feel

511
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:13,799
free to email us and we'll do our best

512
00:24:12,079 --> 00:24:16,199
to

513
00:24:13,798 --> 00:24:19,400
respond now there's two more things I

514
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:21,480
want to say before we wrap this up one

515
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:24,159
is we are always looking for new members

516
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:26,278
and volunteers so if you are interested

517
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:28,120
in getting involved in any way in any

518
00:24:26,278 --> 00:24:31,398
capacity please let us know you can

519
00:24:28,119 --> 00:24:34,158
either email talk to us at the end I

520
00:24:31,398 --> 00:24:35,000
don't think we have a s we can not have

521
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:37,720
a

522
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:40,759
s um but we're also going to do a little

523
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:43,839
activity so underneath most chairs but

524
00:24:40,759 --> 00:24:45,798
not all of them we love a little present

525
00:24:43,839 --> 00:24:47,599
and the idea is you reach under your

526
00:24:45,798 --> 00:24:50,480
chair and find your little

527
00:24:47,599 --> 00:24:53,519
present and you have to walk across the

528
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:53,519
room and try to

529
00:24:55,720 --> 00:25:00,319
find there are more presents than people

530
00:25:04,359 --> 00:25:08,519
you have to find where to put it where

531
00:25:06,519 --> 00:25:11,558
does that go and you have to look around

532
00:25:08,519 --> 00:25:13,879
the room and place it and it's

533
00:25:11,558 --> 00:25:18,038
appropriate thing now you can talk with

534
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:20,880
each other and we have two experts here

535
00:25:18,038 --> 00:25:23,079
spring and George if you're really STK

536
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:23,080
they

537
00:25:25,319 --> 00:25:31,639
will you have to keep saying food scrap

538
00:25:28,679 --> 00:25:34,120
only even though your heart knows and

539
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:37,278
your mind knows it's composable not at

540
00:25:34,119 --> 00:25:38,599
cor now okay this what add up in the

541
00:25:37,278 --> 00:25:42,599
recting

542
00:25:38,599 --> 00:25:45,759
then all right where's the other item

543
00:25:42,599 --> 00:25:47,798
okay custodian we have two

544
00:25:45,759 --> 00:25:53,079
custodians

545
00:25:47,798 --> 00:25:57,000
Jeremy and and Larry if you have a used

546
00:25:53,079 --> 00:25:59,480
light bul get find the custodian and

547
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:01,000
they have speci special places to put

548
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:04,599
them it doesn't matter if it's

549
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:07,640
fluorescent if it's an LED right LED all

550
00:26:04,599 --> 00:26:09,639
light bulbs go to the custodians do not

551
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:11,840
put them in the landfill right there's a

552
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:16,240
little thing if you try to put it in in

553
00:26:11,839 --> 00:26:16,240
the in one of the trash things you get

554
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:24,440
a I'm foing right actually on our C it's

555
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:27,038
actually up against the law really

556
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:29,960
because of we're such a large

557
00:26:27,038 --> 00:26:32,798
institution the life we have to recycle

558
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:35,240
them in a special way so just head up

559
00:26:32,798 --> 00:26:39,639
well the compact fluoresence have mer

560
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:39,640
right yeah I talk

561
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:45,399
about did other people have real I mean

562
00:26:43,599 --> 00:26:48,158
I saw people struggling over little

563
00:26:45,398 --> 00:26:52,479
pieces of wood like you Ste your coffee

564
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:55,399
and I think spring said landfill right

565
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:57,720
it is hard it it should be compostable

566
00:26:55,398 --> 00:27:00,918
but we got to hold line we got to hold

567
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:03,558
the line so J question

568
00:27:00,919 --> 00:27:06,200
for and for the waste management folks

569
00:27:03,558 --> 00:27:09,599
so this is great really enjoyed this and

570
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:12,319
learned a lot um and it's great to do a

571
00:27:09,599 --> 00:27:15,240
better job of what to do with our waste

572
00:27:12,319 --> 00:27:18,918
but there also initiatives on campus to

573
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:20,720
reduce the amount of purchasing that

574
00:27:18,919 --> 00:27:23,440
we're doing the amount of packaging we

575
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:25,360
get with all of our I mean you get a WB

576
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:27,038
Mason sends me you put in an order one

577
00:27:25,359 --> 00:27:29,519
day you get four boxes each with a

578
00:27:27,038 --> 00:27:31,519
little item in at the next day

579
00:27:29,519 --> 00:27:34,398
um and it just seems like there's ways

580
00:27:31,519 --> 00:27:36,960
of reducing not just doing a better job

581
00:27:34,398 --> 00:27:38,359
of of recycling and but how do we

582
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:40,798
actually reduce the amount of waste

583
00:27:38,359 --> 00:27:43,558
we're getting on can Springs probably

584
00:27:40,798 --> 00:27:45,480
spends 10 hours a day thinking exactly

585
00:27:43,558 --> 00:27:47,918
about those so that's what you do that's

586
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:49,759
fantastic um so there's a few things

587
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:51,880
going on there's there's a few things

588
00:27:49,759 --> 00:27:53,919
happening around that so one is um the

589
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:57,000
president sustainable campus committee

590
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:58,759
has a procurement team um that is

591
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,919
working on

592
00:27:58,759 --> 00:28:02,879
she need a microphone can you all hear

593
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:02,880
me Geneva

594
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:09,039
genev hi

595
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:10,960
Geneva um so so there's a the president

596
00:28:09,038 --> 00:28:13,119
sustainable campus committee has 10

597
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:15,600
focused teams um around sustainable

598
00:28:13,119 --> 00:28:17,319
issues one of those teams as W um but

599
00:28:15,599 --> 00:28:19,798
there's also one of those teams as

600
00:28:17,319 --> 00:28:21,359
procurement and so they are focusing

601
00:28:19,798 --> 00:28:23,639
very hard on that so one of the things

602
00:28:21,359 --> 00:28:26,199
they had done uh before WB Mak it with

603
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:28,600
staples as for example um you couldn't

604
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:32,440
place an order for less than $50

605
00:28:28,599 --> 00:28:34,278
to try to force departments to group

606
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:38,840
their orders so that they only send the

607
00:28:34,278 --> 00:28:40,319
one box um and I will admit that my I'm

608
00:28:38,839 --> 00:28:42,599
started getting my feet into the

609
00:28:40,319 --> 00:28:46,639
procurement World

610
00:28:42,599 --> 00:28:48,798
um I'll be getting deeper over time but

611
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:53,480
um but the conversations are happening

612
00:28:48,798 --> 00:28:55,918
so like we we rebid the furniture um bid

613
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:58,519
last year for the first time in like 10

614
00:28:55,919 --> 00:29:01,200
years um and it was great because we had

615
00:28:58,519 --> 00:29:03,159
all these people there talking about

616
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:06,558
making sure that our vendors can supply

617
00:29:03,159 --> 00:29:08,799
US furniture with legs um so George and

618
00:29:06,558 --> 00:29:11,119
I will both tell you that one of our big

619
00:29:08,798 --> 00:29:12,960
grapes is all the modular Furniture

620
00:29:11,119 --> 00:29:14,918
people think it's Legos but it's all

621
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:17,120
wall hung and panel hung and when you

622
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:19,000
start taking it apart you end up losing

623
00:29:17,119 --> 00:29:20,518
a lot of it so trying to ensure that we

624
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,880
have things that are easily movable and

625
00:29:20,519 --> 00:29:23,919
can be used in multiple different ways

626
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:27,480
and not just like the one way that

627
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:29,200
they um no question if you go to a

628
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:30,720
recycling seminar the number one topic

629
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:33,278
of conversation is procurement CU what

630
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:36,240
you buy is in turn what you are getting

631
00:29:33,278 --> 00:29:38,079
rid of um but a lot of that is getting

632
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:39,960
be people able to think about it so Jane

633
00:29:38,079 --> 00:29:42,240
knows about our Min George's minin

634
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:45,278
program we've been working on reducing

635
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:47,640
the size of trash containers um and

636
00:29:45,278 --> 00:29:49,440
having people s carry them to Central

637
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:51,840
points so that people think about what

638
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:54,200
they do we've done um building Audits

639
00:29:51,839 --> 00:29:55,959
and what we find is most of that waste

640
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:59,360
is actually people bringing stuff in for

641
00:29:55,960 --> 00:30:01,558
lunch so you know outside of laboratory

642
00:29:59,359 --> 00:30:04,839
spaces and and things like that you see

643
00:30:01,558 --> 00:30:07,158
a lot of food waste um sorry food

644
00:30:04,839 --> 00:30:09,240
related waste let me point out a lot of

645
00:30:07,159 --> 00:30:12,000
that material is we've done it we don't

646
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:14,960
see much food people do eat it um but a

647
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:16,038
lot of packaging so when these guys are

648
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:18,278
on you about

649
00:30:16,038 --> 00:30:22,119
Tupperware I swear

650
00:30:18,278 --> 00:30:23,640
Tupperware is the answer for world can

651
00:30:22,119 --> 00:30:26,639
you I mean one of the things that we

652
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:29,038
know the least about is the plastic that

653
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:31,880
that you call films right plastic film

654
00:30:29,038 --> 00:30:35,079
technical word technical word so one and

655
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:37,320
we do have plastic films um that you can

656
00:30:35,079 --> 00:30:39,519
dispose of in in Hort on first and

657
00:30:37,319 --> 00:30:43,240
second floors the question is what

658
00:30:39,519 --> 00:30:47,960
qualifies as a a film so give us the

659
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:50,798
tech film yes film film is hard recy

660
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:54,120
recycling of film of plastics is it has

661
00:30:50,798 --> 00:30:55,638
to be soft it can't be crinkly yes I was

662
00:30:54,119 --> 00:30:59,079
looking for something that was crinkly

663
00:30:55,638 --> 00:31:01,638
in here uh there was a CR right here

664
00:30:59,079 --> 00:31:05,158
this is crinkly it does not go it has to

665
00:31:01,638 --> 00:31:09,240
be landfill right so if it

666
00:31:05,159 --> 00:31:11,240
crinkles all right like cellophane crl

667
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:12,960
there's literally this is the best way

668
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:14,759
we've been we found we've looked

669
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:16,679
nationally at how people describe the

670
00:31:14,759 --> 00:31:20,480
difference between recyclable film and

671
00:31:16,679 --> 00:31:20,480
non- recyclable film it's not

672
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:27,240
label so the folks over at County Rec

673
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:29,558
told me that you know those things that

674
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:32,558
come like cardboard packaging and there

675
00:31:29,558 --> 00:31:36,879
something that's somewhat soft clear

676
00:31:32,558 --> 00:31:41,278
plastic like the Wan's pasta

677
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:45,480
thingies okay I know or even Electronics

678
00:31:41,278 --> 00:31:50,319
clear plastic that doesn't have it's not

679
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:52,399
a n they told me that go is that right

680
00:31:50,319 --> 00:31:54,839
that's that's that's single stream if

681
00:31:52,398 --> 00:31:57,158
it'll hold form you can put it in single

682
00:31:54,839 --> 00:31:59,398
stream recycling if they didn't want it

683
00:31:57,159 --> 00:32:03,840
they want

684
00:31:59,398 --> 00:32:07,038
if it's if it holds form go into it goes

685
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:09,678
into plastic if it's soft like this it

686
00:32:07,038 --> 00:32:13,638
goes into the m so bubble wrap can go in

687
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:18,120
here but like that that plastic that

688
00:32:13,638 --> 00:32:19,558
like kids toys come in that cuts you

689
00:32:18,119 --> 00:32:22,798
when you try to open

690
00:32:19,558 --> 00:32:25,599
it that that's single

691
00:32:22,798 --> 00:32:28,079
string the only thing the only plastic

692
00:32:25,599 --> 00:32:30,319
that we frequently get that doesn't go

693
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:33,278
in single stream that is hard is

694
00:32:30,319 --> 00:32:36,119
styrofoam and that's landfill yes that

695
00:32:33,278 --> 00:32:38,359
is landfill in Northeast United States

696
00:32:36,119 --> 00:32:40,839
we don't have anywhere to send it here

697
00:32:38,359 --> 00:32:43,319
um I think there's a place in

698
00:32:40,839 --> 00:32:45,480
Portland and then somewhere in England

699
00:32:43,319 --> 00:32:47,558
but um we're not sending we're not

700
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:51,200
shipping it there and it's it's it's too

701
00:32:47,558 --> 00:32:53,158
fluffy and it's and the shipping of it

702
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:55,840
does not counterbalance so you'll hear

703
00:32:53,159 --> 00:32:58,080
about Walmart for example believe I'm

704
00:32:55,839 --> 00:32:59,879
going to say this so Walmart is a really

705
00:32:58,079 --> 00:33:01,359
job with their styrofoam because since

706
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:03,360
they're driving their own trucks they

707
00:33:01,359 --> 00:33:05,599
back haul it um and then they condense

708
00:33:03,359 --> 00:33:07,319
it and they ship it overseas to do it

709
00:33:05,599 --> 00:33:10,119
but if you're just shipping for shipping

710
00:33:07,319 --> 00:33:14,879
sake it's not there's no value on it so

711
00:33:10,119 --> 00:33:14,879
does Corell recycle packing matal

712
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:20,639
yes I'm talking about like

713
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:22,440
Styrofoam no styrofoam and the truth is

714
00:33:20,638 --> 00:33:26,000
so there's there's actually very limited

715
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:28,960
amount of Styrofoam on campus um

716
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,679
the the computer equipment is what

717
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:32,558
people most associate with it and Dell

718
00:33:30,679 --> 00:33:35,360
is working very hard and that's our main

719
00:33:32,558 --> 00:33:38,319
contractor for computer supplies Dell um

720
00:33:35,359 --> 00:33:40,319
is working on cardboard packaging now um

721
00:33:38,319 --> 00:33:43,398
so most of the styrofoam that we see on

722
00:33:40,319 --> 00:33:44,720
campus is due to laboratory where I'm

723
00:33:43,398 --> 00:33:46,839
sorry I didn't gross anybody out but

724
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:49,159
like if you're shipping part of a dead

725
00:33:46,839 --> 00:33:52,558
thing you have to keep it cold sorry

726
00:33:49,159 --> 00:33:55,240
sorry um but it's such cases we don't

727
00:33:52,558 --> 00:33:57,440
want to recycle that anyway um and they

728
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:59,480
don't have a better option right now we

729
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:02,639
have question back yes so the Cornell

730
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:04,278
dining Halls we doing the Disposable um

731
00:34:02,638 --> 00:34:06,038
trays and utensils I don't know if

732
00:34:04,278 --> 00:34:08,760
they're still doing that it's because of

733
00:34:06,038 --> 00:34:09,759
the drought right right waste right now

734
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:11,879
yeah so what are your thoughts on that

735
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:14,240
and how has that affected the loads of

736
00:34:11,878 --> 00:34:16,759
waste um it's kind of not Mak us look so

737
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:19,959
good this year oh but Cornell dining

738
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:22,280
told me was it is it is taking a giant

739
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:24,599
bite out of their their budget the

740
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:27,320
landfill waste from from the dining hall

741
00:34:24,599 --> 00:34:29,359
is thre it's it's not a good thing but

742
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:31,039
um I I am on the drought committee I'm

743
00:34:29,358 --> 00:34:34,279
on two other drought committees and I

744
00:34:31,039 --> 00:34:36,279
was the first one to say you know as

745
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:37,760
sometimes you have to make a choice and

746
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:40,200
this is one of those times the drought

747
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:42,200
is quite serious is it still are they

748
00:34:40,199 --> 00:34:44,239
still doing that or they are they're

749
00:34:42,199 --> 00:34:45,439
they're still doing it we're hoping we

750
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:48,719
we're hoping things are going to get

751
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:52,960
better but I have a three o00 on that

752
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:55,519
so um but if things don't improve what

753
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:58,039
it is doing is it is having a helping us

754
00:34:55,519 --> 00:35:02,000
keep drop water consumption on campus

755
00:34:58,039 --> 00:35:06,159
20% and right now we're having to to

756
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:08,239
balance better toal there I I think Lori

757
00:35:06,159 --> 00:35:12,199
also wanted to remind everybody that

758
00:35:08,239 --> 00:35:15,199
Tomkins count Tomkins County recycle and

759
00:35:12,199 --> 00:35:17,639
waste will help you dispose of most

760
00:35:15,199 --> 00:35:20,279
everything and put it in the appropriate

761
00:35:17,639 --> 00:35:23,960
place and most of it is free right I

762
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:25,839
mean unless you have huge amounts or if

763
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:29,159
you have freezers or things like that

764
00:35:25,838 --> 00:35:31,519
they charge you a uh a fee for that but

765
00:35:29,159 --> 00:35:33,879
if you have questions about home waste

766
00:35:31,519 --> 00:35:36,320
Tomkins County recycles go are are the

767
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:39,000
compostable fors and and stuff more

768
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:41,119
expensive than what the Alternatives

769
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:43,800
would be and if we're not composting

770
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:44,680
that why do we buy them yeah I I don't

771
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:48,240
know what

772
00:35:44,679 --> 00:35:50,879
the question I can answer that um for

773
00:35:48,239 --> 00:35:53,159
canvas uh the costs are about the same

774
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:55,079
our procurement group over the years has

775
00:35:53,159 --> 00:35:57,318
been able to contract a very good price

776
00:35:55,079 --> 00:35:58,800
for that um if you're seeing them a lot

777
00:35:57,318 --> 00:36:02,279
of what you're seeing are ones that

778
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:05,000
people still have um the new compost

779
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:06,760
change went into effect last month um so

780
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,480
there's still a lot of material out

781
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:11,160
there that simply hasn't been used up

782
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:13,639
yet um so there will be different kinds

783
00:36:11,159 --> 00:36:16,358
of fors we'll go back to plastic instead

784
00:36:13,639 --> 00:36:17,799
of post one thing you'll notice though

785
00:36:16,358 --> 00:36:21,639
is it's really hard to tell the

786
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:25,119
difference between the two um and

787
00:36:21,639 --> 00:36:26,519
so which is a part of the problem um is

788
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:29,200
that it's hard to tell the difference

789
00:36:26,519 --> 00:36:31,519
but um Cornel dying started last

790
00:36:29,199 --> 00:36:33,279
December in certain dying HS see what

791
00:36:31,519 --> 00:36:35,318
the difference is because in post

792
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:37,720
consumer where customers are sorting

793
00:36:35,318 --> 00:36:41,279
stuff after the use almost 50% of the

794
00:36:37,719 --> 00:36:44,118
compos had be rejected um so the hope is

795
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:46,880
that by having this the stream be

796
00:36:44,119 --> 00:36:48,760
consistent um we'll actually hopefully

797
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:51,880
be able to actually capture more compost

798
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:55,280
because we won so much and then it it's

799
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:57,680
also it's also easier for departments

800
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:59,839
you know if they're having an event

801
00:36:57,679 --> 00:37:03,078
try to change the rules depending on if

802
00:36:59,838 --> 00:37:06,239
there have compos or not it was just

803
00:37:03,079 --> 00:37:08,359
getting untenable got a question here

804
00:37:06,239 --> 00:37:12,879
and then one there so is the idea with

805
00:37:08,358 --> 00:37:16,318
the food only to

806
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:19,838
mainly negate all of that stuff that is

807
00:37:16,318 --> 00:37:22,880
like claims biodegradable and is that a

808
00:37:19,838 --> 00:37:25,318
labeling issue due to policy making or

809
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:27,760
does it actually like why can they label

810
00:37:25,318 --> 00:37:29,838
it as biodegradable

811
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:32,160
so why they can label this biodegradable

812
00:37:29,838 --> 00:37:34,759
it breaks down over X many years and

813
00:37:32,159 --> 00:37:38,920
there's I don't

814
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:40,920
think okay so um the compostable is is a

815
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:45,280
little different because it's different

816
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:47,318
chemically for for the ground um the Big

817
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:49,760
Challenge as far as why we go to Food

818
00:37:47,318 --> 00:37:51,719
scraps and napkins only are two things

819
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:54,240
one is those compostable Plastics don't

820
00:37:51,719 --> 00:37:57,598
break down very quickly um and the other

821
00:37:54,239 --> 00:37:59,799
piece is total contamination so if you

822
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:01,480
go out to Cornell Compost Facility

823
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:03,960
they've always kept the dining compost

824
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:05,719
separate because they can't use it

825
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:07,159
except on their own Fields because

826
00:38:05,719 --> 00:38:08,639
there's little forks and knives and

827
00:38:07,159 --> 00:38:10,039
Pepsi bottles sticking out of it all

828
00:38:08,639 --> 00:38:12,279
over the place so you can't put it under

829
00:38:10,039 --> 00:38:14,719
the toolup a day haul and

830
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:17,720
just so

831
00:38:14,719 --> 00:38:20,039
um so there's that um but the other

832
00:38:17,719 --> 00:38:21,118
thing is and you guys let me know if

833
00:38:20,039 --> 00:38:22,239
this isn't right because this is

834
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:24,440
something I've heard but I've never

835
00:38:22,239 --> 00:38:26,239
actually seen documentation on it um

836
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:28,639
which is that the compostable Plastics

837
00:38:26,239 --> 00:38:31,118
of has more methane than regular

838
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:35,239
Plastics when they break down so what

839
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:37,119
happens is also with um campus using all

840
00:38:35,239 --> 00:38:38,598
sorts of composable plastics all over

841
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:41,000
you're only capturing what people

842
00:38:38,599 --> 00:38:42,480
properly use in the dining hall which

843
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,800
means as soon as they walk out and they

844
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:45,519
go all over campus they're putting in

845
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:47,960
recycling and then we're contaminating

846
00:38:45,519 --> 00:38:50,159
the recycling pins as compos to Plastics

847
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:51,880
aren't recyclable and then we're also

848
00:38:50,159 --> 00:38:54,000
that material is ending up the land fill

849
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:56,838
and it's just doing more more harm than

850
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:58,079
good good um doesn't help the recycling

851
00:38:56,838 --> 00:39:00,559
industry at all if we're just

852
00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:01,519
contaminating it like crazy so got

853
00:39:00,559 --> 00:39:04,719
another

854
00:39:01,519 --> 00:39:07,119
question exactly Great lead my question

855
00:39:04,719 --> 00:39:08,559
um so recycling it's all I know like

856
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:09,880
compost you can contaminate it and if

857
00:39:08,559 --> 00:39:11,960
you contaminate it you send it to the

858
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:14,640
landfill is that the same with recycling

859
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:17,079
no no so if you recycling gets hands

860
00:39:14,639 --> 00:39:19,559
sorted down at Tomkins County which is

861
00:39:17,079 --> 00:39:23,160
why for anyone here working Labs very

862
00:39:19,559 --> 00:39:24,838
often Labs or clinical spaces so we've

863
00:39:23,159 --> 00:39:26,960
had to work really hard in Labs where

864
00:39:24,838 --> 00:39:29,880
people want to do the right thing and

865
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:31,838
then say this needle metal it'll recycle

866
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:35,358
um and it's like a that's against the

867
00:39:31,838 --> 00:39:37,799
law but b um you know people are hand

868
00:39:35,358 --> 00:39:39,920
sorting this material so we don't want

869
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:44,160
people being exposed

870
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:48,200
to whatever goes on in the labs okay um

871
00:39:44,159 --> 00:39:49,799
I'll just leave it at that so so so uh

872
00:39:48,199 --> 00:39:51,960
compost however there's no sorting

873
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:55,240
process uh for us on campus it could

874
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:57,440
hand sorted at T County anything that uh

875
00:39:55,239 --> 00:39:59,838
and they capture the high value material

876
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:01,240
high value Plastics and high value paper

877
00:39:59,838 --> 00:40:04,318
okay and they sell it that's part of how

878
00:40:01,239 --> 00:40:06,000
the county funds the recycling program

879
00:40:04,318 --> 00:40:08,119
what they don't gets mixed in with our

880
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:10,679
residential recycling which goes to

881
00:40:08,119 --> 00:40:13,760
Ontario County oh it's Ontario Ontario

882
00:40:10,679 --> 00:40:16,039
County it's okay we don't use on we use

883
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:18,200
Ontario that was one of my questions we

884
00:40:16,039 --> 00:40:22,639
have a GP against meows they're they're

885
00:40:18,199 --> 00:40:24,239
not so great but um the and then it can

886
00:40:22,639 --> 00:40:25,960
sorted again where there's people but

887
00:40:24,239 --> 00:40:28,159
then there's also magnets and lasers and

888
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:30,838
all this cool stuff that does

889
00:40:28,159 --> 00:40:34,000
um is that National like is that

890
00:40:30,838 --> 00:40:36,078
everywhere recycl get recycling gets

891
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:38,400
hand sorted or is that in general it's

892
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:40,800
always hands sorted one way or the other

893
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:44,079
um we are actually really really lucky

894
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:46,318
that we have um both a wonderful County

895
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:50,119
and we have a really really good vendor

896
00:40:46,318 --> 00:40:52,239
um if you go to tyoga County which is 20

897
00:40:50,119 --> 00:40:54,358
mil 10 miles

898
00:40:52,239 --> 00:40:55,879
south they don't their programs are

899
00:40:54,358 --> 00:40:58,519
different so you have a great amount of

900
00:40:55,880 --> 00:41:00,039
inconsistency not just state by state

901
00:40:58,519 --> 00:41:02,199
but county by

902
00:41:00,039 --> 00:41:05,599
county also I don't know if you're aware

903
00:41:02,199 --> 00:41:08,159
of that but Men actually sorting through

904
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:13,039
the compost every day to get out the

905
00:41:08,159 --> 00:41:16,358
compost night the Mand owner um

906
00:41:13,039 --> 00:41:18,920
forgetting her name um she's wonderful

907
00:41:16,358 --> 00:41:21,039
and she pays her employees to hand sort

908
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:23,318
the compost right the compost because

909
00:41:21,039 --> 00:41:25,199
people to hands sort everything right to

910
00:41:23,318 --> 00:41:28,719
make sure that what she sends out of

911
00:41:25,199 --> 00:41:32,879
there is you know properly sorted which

912
00:41:28,719 --> 00:41:32,879
is she's paying a lot to

913
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:41,358
do think the man managing

914
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:52,240
as what

915
00:41:48,719 --> 00:41:52,239
advantages and

916
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:59,240
disadvantages mean why do we do a better

917
00:41:55,039 --> 00:41:59,239
job yeah yeah

918
00:42:03,559 --> 00:42:08,199
job other if you compare so we have some

919
00:42:06,838 --> 00:42:11,920
there's some other colleges out there

920
00:42:08,199 --> 00:42:13,679
that do better than we do straight up

921
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:16,119
you know they're out there ruers is

922
00:42:13,679 --> 00:42:18,759
phenomenal you know um and different

923
00:42:16,119 --> 00:42:21,720
ones do better for different reasons um

924
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:23,319
it very much relies on the community we

925
00:42:21,719 --> 00:42:27,719
very much want our community inter

926
00:42:23,318 --> 00:42:30,880
venters um so so first off Tomkins count

927
00:42:27,719 --> 00:42:34,279
is is amazing um and uh their director

928
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:35,880
is Barb eom who graduate who yeah she

929
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:37,680
Cornell graduate and it has been her

930
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:40,519
passion in life she she's been working

931
00:42:37,679 --> 00:42:42,799
on this since the 80s um and has

932
00:42:40,519 --> 00:42:46,039
programs where as a resident I pay for

933
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:48,599
trash but my recycling's free um and

934
00:42:46,039 --> 00:42:51,079
they also have put laws in place to

935
00:42:48,599 --> 00:42:54,480
require um companies to do that it's

936
00:42:51,079 --> 00:42:57,318
great so we're really lucky that way um

937
00:42:54,480 --> 00:43:00,838
but we also have aity Initiative for a

938
00:42:57,318 --> 00:43:03,159
great institution um we have a lot of um

939
00:43:00,838 --> 00:43:05,880
commitment as a as an institution to do

940
00:43:03,159 --> 00:43:09,519
the right thing and and use the campus

941
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:12,680
as a as a living lab and that is

942
00:43:09,519 --> 00:43:15,838
fantastic as as someone who's a part of

943
00:43:12,679 --> 00:43:17,480
this place because we have uh buyin and

944
00:43:15,838 --> 00:43:19,519
and support team members from

945
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:22,079
departments all over campus and that

946
00:43:19,519 --> 00:43:24,079
helps us we're going to have to call

947
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:25,680
back make one comment so this had to do

948
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:27,880
with the the biking walking thing at the

949
00:43:25,679 --> 00:43:30,558
end I went to a thing yesterday where

950
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:32,760
they opened the Black Diamond Trail and

951
00:43:30,559 --> 00:43:36,760
back tomin County said within 5 years we

952
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:36,760
will have 51 miles of

953
00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:46,720
biking so you know at Cornell about um

954
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:49,119
only about a third of Staff drive to

955
00:43:46,719 --> 00:43:52,159
campus alone others otherwise and about

956
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:54,640
90% of students commute by biker walking

957
00:43:52,159 --> 00:43:55,679
so in that we I think we may be the best

958
00:43:54,639 --> 00:43:58,400
in the

959
00:43:55,679 --> 00:44:01,399
country so thank you very much to

960
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:03,280
presenters and to visiting guests this

961
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:06,880
was really fascinating and I encourage

962
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:09,400
you to recycle and repurpose these

963
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:11,640
discussions outside so we can get ready

964
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:12,690
for the next occupant in the road but

965
00:44:11,639 --> 00:44:16,118
thanks very

966
00:44:12,690 --> 00:44:18,760
