1
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:05,040
this is a production of cornell

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:05,040
university

3
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,120
so again my name is daniel greenberg and

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,718
i'm founder and director of this

5
00:00:13,119 --> 00:00:17,679
organization called living roots

6
00:00:14,718 --> 00:00:18,879
and what i want to do is really briefly

7
00:00:17,679 --> 00:00:20,399
talk about what our

8
00:00:18,879 --> 00:00:22,000
ecovillages these sustainable

9
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:23,839
communities that we work with

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,118
and i'll just show one slide of each of

11
00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:26,879
the places we go just to give you a

12
00:00:25,118 --> 00:00:29,439
flavor of some of the communities

13
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:31,439
and then i really want to talk about why

14
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:33,280
we believe ecovillages

15
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:35,280
and sustainable communities make ideal

16
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,558
campuses to teach about sustainable

17
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,759
community development and i'll do a

18
00:00:36,558 --> 00:00:40,878
comparison between

19
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:43,119
ecovillages and academia so and i

20
00:00:40,878 --> 00:00:45,359
usually start off with some big

21
00:00:43,119 --> 00:00:47,839
picture stuff state of the world climate

22
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:49,759
change peak oil carrying capacity

23
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,520
footprint i'm not going to do all that

24
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:52,878
because i'm just guessing i'm assuming

25
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,280
that i'm preaching to the converted here

26
00:00:52,878 --> 00:00:54,878
that

27
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,640
you all understand that we're living in

28
00:00:54,878 --> 00:00:58,320
a unique time not just in human history

29
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,079
but in planetary history

30
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,159
right good we're all on the same page

31
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:03,840
there okay so let's move on i don't have

32
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:06,239
to talk about the why so much

33
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,079
so there's a couple of ways into talking

34
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:11,280
about what ecovillages are

35
00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:12,239
if this thing will start working you

36
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,280
have to

37
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:15,280
hang up close here

38
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:19,200
why isn't that working

39
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:24,478
it shows me give me a second

40
00:01:25,599 --> 00:01:27,839
hmm

41
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,680
that's never happened before i mean oh

42
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:34,640
did it work out good

43
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:36,159
okay let's hope that works out so eco

44
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,079
villages in its simplest form

45
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:39,680
are just a group of people right and

46
00:01:38,078 --> 00:01:40,478
they've come together and they're trying

47
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,040
to

48
00:01:40,478 --> 00:01:44,959
model sustainable lifestyles they're

49
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,680
basically saying look we can't wait any

50
00:01:44,959 --> 00:01:47,359
longer

51
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,520
we can't wait for governments to

52
00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:51,759
legislate solutions we can't wait for

53
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:53,280
businesses to bring solutions to market

54
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:53,759
where are the best practices around the

55
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,320
world

56
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:58,159
from sustainable agriculture renewable

57
00:01:56,319 --> 00:01:59,839
energy appropriate technology

58
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:01,200
local building materials all of that how

59
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:04,478
do we bring them together

60
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,960
into community scale solutions that work

61
00:02:04,478 --> 00:02:07,519
for us

62
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:08,639
and for our environment right so they're

63
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:10,159
not utopias

64
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:12,000
and i really need to say that clearly

65
00:02:10,159 --> 00:02:12,878
these are not perfect places i went

66
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,239
looking for them

67
00:02:12,878 --> 00:02:16,159
i couldn't find them i still haven't

68
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:18,080
found any but they're trying

69
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:19,439
and as such we feel like they make these

70
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,400
ideal campuses to learn about

71
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:22,479
sustainable

72
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,400
development so another way to think

73
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:26,000
about ecovillages we're all aware of

74
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,400
this growing gap between the resource

75
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,919
rich

76
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,080
and the resource poor around the world

77
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:32,479
right and

78
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,440
most people when you talk to them or if

79
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:35,199
you're reading about sustainable

80
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:36,878
development we're talking about this

81
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:38,878
right how do we raise the quality of

82
00:02:36,878 --> 00:02:41,199
life among the resource poor

83
00:02:38,878 --> 00:02:42,239
which i mean i'm not arguing with this

84
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:43,759
at all i mean this is

85
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:45,599
critical work there are billions of

86
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:48,959
people living without

87
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:50,238
access to clean water education medical

88
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:53,120
facilities shelter

89
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:54,080
right absolutely this needs to happen

90
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,159
but what i don't hear

91
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,440
a lot of people talking about is what

92
00:02:56,159 --> 00:02:58,639
are the goals what are the models what

93
00:02:57,439 --> 00:02:59,919
are the limits to this kind of

94
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:01,839
development

95
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:03,039
and often if you scratch a little bit

96
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,400
just below the surface people will

97
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:05,840
respond well

98
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,039
i don't know i mean give us a break

99
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,158
we're trying to raise the quality of

100
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:08,479
life with people who really need it you

101
00:03:08,158 --> 00:03:09,919
know

102
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:12,799
maybe if we're lucky we'll get to first

103
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:14,158
world standard lifestyles

104
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,159
you know this is a kind of a delicate

105
00:03:14,158 --> 00:03:16,959
thing to say myself as a privileged

106
00:03:16,158 --> 00:03:19,199
westerner

107
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:20,800
that this may not be possible because

108
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:21,439
the evidence is really clear that our

109
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,519
planet

110
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:24,560
can't support our present population of

111
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:26,799
around 7 billion

112
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,158
with our present lifestyles much less

113
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:30,879
the 9 or 10 billion

114
00:03:28,158 --> 00:03:32,399
expected by 2040 all living first world

115
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:33,679
standard lights does all with a car in

116
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,039
the garage

117
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,799
it's just not going to happen and you

118
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:37,199
know it's not even up for us to decide i

119
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:39,920
mean

120
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:41,439
the earth is already giving us feedback

121
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:42,798
there are already consequences around

122
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:44,840
our global actions through

123
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:46,480
climate change and and peak oil and

124
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:48,799
everything so

125
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:49,840
we absolutely need to figure out where

126
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:52,159
are the goals

127
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,878
for resource poor to raise their quality

128
00:03:52,158 --> 00:03:55,438
of life

129
00:03:52,878 --> 00:03:56,719
and of course equally important if not

130
00:03:55,438 --> 00:03:58,239
more important we need to figure out how

131
00:03:56,719 --> 00:03:59,519
to reduce the ecological impact of the

132
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:01,280
resource rich

133
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:03,438
us i'm talking by large westernized

134
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:05,598
countries and you know we talk about

135
00:04:03,438 --> 00:04:07,840
hybrid cars and compost and recycling

136
00:04:05,598 --> 00:04:09,919
and all that good stuff important stuff

137
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,438
but i would suggest that if we're going

138
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:13,438
to get through this bottleneck

139
00:04:11,438 --> 00:04:14,719
that i think we're facing as a species

140
00:04:13,438 --> 00:04:16,639
we need to consider more

141
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:17,918
radical alternatives and so really what

142
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:20,400
ecovillages have done

143
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:21,839
is they've staked out this middle ground

144
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:23,120
between this growing gap

145
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:24,879
of the resource rich in the resource

146
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:27,120
board they're saying how do we raise

147
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:28,000
the resource poor above what someone

148
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,079
called the dignity

149
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,240
floor how do we allow everyone on the

150
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:35,279
planet to have a base

151
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:37,918
access to adequate wealth and resources

152
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:38,959
a sense of agency in their lives a sense

153
00:04:37,918 --> 00:04:40,478
of well-being

154
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:42,239
right how do we get everyone above the

155
00:04:40,478 --> 00:04:43,439
dignity floor and at the same time how

156
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,120
do we get everyone

157
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:46,478
below what someone called a profligacy

158
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,079
ceiling otherwise known as carrying

159
00:04:46,478 --> 00:04:51,279
capacity right

160
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:52,399
this is our livable zone in here and we

161
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:54,638
all have to get in there

162
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:55,599
if we're going to survive if not thrive

163
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:58,720
as a species

164
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:01,280
and the sad truth is very few of us are

165
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:02,960
very few even the eco villages we go to

166
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:04,159
i'll show you a slide of finn horn

167
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:07,599
anyone here findhorn

168
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:08,880
plays a northern scholar or a couple

169
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,479
they're going to celebrate their 50th

170
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:12,159
anniversary next year they're probably

171
00:05:10,478 --> 00:05:14,000
the grandmother the grandfather of the

172
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,120
contemporary eco village movement

173
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,120
and they're they're really on the

174
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,680
cutting edge of of what this is all

175
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,680
about

176
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,959
and there was a study done a couple

177
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,439
years ago looking at

178
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:24,879
their ecological footprint and what they

179
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:27,918
found was

180
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:29,680
the average member of finn horn had half

181
00:05:27,918 --> 00:05:30,319
the ecological footprint they were using

182
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,079
half of

183
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:33,439
uh ecologically productive land and

184
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:36,319
water area than

185
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:37,680
an average uk citizen it was great you

186
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:39,120
know it made international press they

187
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,759
were lauded as the most sustainable

188
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:43,038
village in the

189
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:44,560
in the western hemisphere and

190
00:05:43,038 --> 00:05:46,639
you know if everyone lived the way they

191
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,319
live at finhorn we'd still need more

192
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:50,639
than one planet

193
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:51,839
so here's finn horn on the cutting edge

194
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:54,240
of the ecovillage movement and they're

195
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:57,599
still not in this livable zone

196
00:05:54,240 --> 00:06:00,079
so you know the sad truth is i really

197
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:02,160
think we're in kindergarten

198
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:04,478
as a species we're in kindergarten in

199
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:06,000
terms of where we need to be

200
00:06:04,478 --> 00:06:07,680
in sustainable relationship to each

201
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,120
other in the planet you know eco

202
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,360
villages

203
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,800
maybe third fourth grade i don't know

204
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:14,000
you know but we need to get to middle

205
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:17,038
school high school

206
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,720
college we need to graduate because i do

207
00:06:17,038 --> 00:06:21,199
think there are some exams coming

208
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:22,479
that we really want to pass and so

209
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:25,199
ecovillages are just

210
00:06:22,478 --> 00:06:26,719
experiments they're beta test centers

211
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:27,439
they're saying how do we try to figure

212
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,479
this out

213
00:06:27,439 --> 00:06:30,800
because we're going to have to figure

214
00:06:28,478 --> 00:06:32,318
this out so that's a little bit about

215
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,199
ecovillages just really quickly about

216
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:36,080
living roots

217
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:37,120
we're an educational non-profit we

218
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:38,800
partner with the university of

219
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,319
massachusetts and amherst and we run

220
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,160
these study abroad programs based

221
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:44,560
in sustainable communities and eco

222
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:46,560
villages around the world

223
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,000
some quick background i actually was an

224
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:50,160
undergrad at cornell

225
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,918
and i started in electrical engineering

226
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,720
and then i shifted to psychology i

227
00:06:51,918 --> 00:06:55,279
started teaching

228
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:57,520
computers to kids at giac downtown and i

229
00:06:55,279 --> 00:07:00,239
realized i like kids more than computers

230
00:06:57,519 --> 00:07:00,799
and and i started dreaming of creating a

231
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,960
school

232
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,879
for children in a community setting and

233
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:06,560
then i went to minnesota to do

234
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:08,079
doctoral work at the university of

235
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,720
minnesota in minneapolis

236
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:11,279
and i ended up doing my my doctoral

237
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,680
thesis

238
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:14,478
on children and growing up in communes

239
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,319
essentially

240
00:07:14,478 --> 00:07:18,079
intentional communities and i studied

241
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:19,680
the topic probably two years

242
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:21,279
sent out surveys everywhere i could find

243
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:24,000
read everything i could find

244
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:26,000
and and then hopped into a westphalia

245
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,319
campervan with my then partner now wife

246
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,478
monique and we traveled to about 30

247
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:32,319
or 40 intentional communities communes

248
00:07:30,478 --> 00:07:35,199
around north america

249
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:35,598
and i swear i think i learned more the

250
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:38,079
first

251
00:07:35,598 --> 00:07:39,038
day i stepped foot in one of these

252
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:40,719
communities

253
00:07:39,038 --> 00:07:43,199
than i did in those two years i had

254
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,520
spent studying i was like oh now i get

255
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:45,120
it

256
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:47,839
you know i suddenly understood it

257
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,639
viscerally and then i had to do a school

258
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:50,799
psychology

259
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:52,400
internship for my doctoral program and i

260
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,079
wrote around to communities and finhorn

261
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:55,439
this community in scotland wrote back

262
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:57,598
said yeah we could use some help with

263
00:07:55,439 --> 00:08:00,639
our kids which they did

264
00:07:57,598 --> 00:08:02,478
and so we moved there for a year and it

265
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:04,160
was an incredible experience really

266
00:08:02,478 --> 00:08:04,560
amazing and in the middle of that year a

267
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,240
friend

268
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,918
brought over some college students from

269
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,680
i think it was prescott college

270
00:08:07,918 --> 00:08:10,959
and they were there for a week maybe two

271
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,840
weeks but in that time

272
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:15,439
frame i saw each one of them like pop

273
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:17,038
you know their lives were transformed in

274
00:08:15,439 --> 00:08:18,879
very much the same way that i felt when

275
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:21,120
i started traveling to communities

276
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:22,720
and i remember waking up with goosebumps

277
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,959
one night thinking oh this is

278
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,240
this is why i'm here it felt like on

279
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:28,719
that level of purpose

280
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:30,560
how do i build this bridge between

281
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:32,399
academia and these communities to help

282
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:34,559
more people have this experience of

283
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:35,918
of connection of interdependence

284
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:38,639
community

285
00:08:35,918 --> 00:08:40,718
and so that was back in 92 and so the

286
00:08:38,639 --> 00:08:43,838
last 20 years has really been about

287
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:45,839
doing this uh and i started

288
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:47,519
directing a program to south india to a

289
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:49,839
community called orville i'll show you

290
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:51,839
a slide of that and then in 98 i left

291
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:54,399
and 99 i started living roots

292
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:56,080
so it's been an amazing experience and

293
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:56,958
and blessing and privilege to be able to

294
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,240
do this work

295
00:08:56,958 --> 00:09:00,000
these are the programs that we run

296
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:01,039
currently we do semester january and

297
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,159
summer programs

298
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:07,519
semester we go to finhorn in scotland uh

299
00:09:04,159 --> 00:09:09,759
israel the

300
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:11,200
monteverdi institute in costa rica and

301
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:12,799
oroville in south india

302
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:15,040
and then in january we go to weiwei

303
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:17,199
kyoto a community in mexico

304
00:09:15,039 --> 00:09:19,199
as well as oroville and india and then

305
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:21,759
in the summer we have programs in

306
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:23,600
peru high amazon approved called a

307
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:24,958
couple communities near

308
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,278
sorry a couple programs near the

309
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:29,518
community i live near called sirius

310
00:09:27,278 --> 00:09:30,399
and brazil ecocentric epec and australia

311
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:32,639
and crystal waters

312
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:35,039
and there's others that we're looking at

313
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:36,879
there are probably about two thousand

314
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:38,480
self-identified ecovillages on the

315
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:40,159
planet and there's many more that just

316
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,278
don't self-identify that way i mean sri

317
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:43,039
lanka there's like 10

318
00:09:41,278 --> 00:09:44,480
000 villages that are trying to develop

319
00:09:43,039 --> 00:09:46,000
sustainably so

320
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,519
it all depends on how you define them

321
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,039
and where you draw the line but

322
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:51,120
to me this is some of the most exciting

323
00:09:49,039 --> 00:09:51,519
news of the planet that there are people

324
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,679
just

325
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:55,120
doing it how do we figure this out in

326
00:09:53,679 --> 00:09:57,278
community scale

327
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,720
so just to show you one picture of each

328
00:09:57,278 --> 00:09:59,200
of these places this is the semester

329
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,278
program

330
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:03,040
at finhorn in scotland finhorn's way up

331
00:10:01,278 --> 00:10:05,519
here on the north coast

332
00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:07,278
of scotland right on the north sea about

333
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:08,799
a half hour east of inverness which

334
00:10:07,278 --> 00:10:11,519
where the loch ness monster is supposed

335
00:10:08,799 --> 00:10:14,879
to be it's a good 10 hours from

336
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:17,120
london by bus and again fin horn's going

337
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:19,759
to be celebrating its 50th anniversary

338
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,240
next november and there's about 450

339
00:10:19,759 --> 00:10:22,879
people

340
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,519
from maybe 30 35 different nationalities

341
00:10:22,879 --> 00:10:26,559
and their

342
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:29,360
what their motto is creating positive

343
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:30,719
visions for humanity and the planet

344
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,399
that's what they're about there's a

345
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,120
saying actually at fin horn that goes

346
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:35,759
work

347
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:37,039
is love and action work is love in

348
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:39,120
action

349
00:10:37,039 --> 00:10:40,799
you know the idea being how do we how do

350
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:42,240
we raise our consciousness to the

351
00:10:40,799 --> 00:10:44,719
highest level possible

352
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:46,000
and then how do we manifest that in the

353
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,680
world how do we bring that into the

354
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,600
world in everything we do

355
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:51,599
whether it's harvesting beets whether

356
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,959
it's building a building whether it's

357
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,839
you know cooking a meal or cleaning a

358
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:58,000
toilet and it shows you know there's a

359
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:58,880
there's a an attention to detail a sense

360
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,919
of aesthetic

361
00:10:58,879 --> 00:11:03,919
that fin horn and i know just

362
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:05,120
being there i feel uplifted and it's

363
00:11:03,919 --> 00:11:06,559
just really nice to be around people

364
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,078
that are really consciously trying to do

365
00:11:06,559 --> 00:11:10,559
that i mean check it out this is their

366
00:11:08,078 --> 00:11:11,278
conference hall and it was built mostly

367
00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:12,879
out of

368
00:11:11,278 --> 00:11:13,838
volunteer labor but you can't really see

369
00:11:12,879 --> 00:11:15,439
probably from where you are but the

370
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:16,959
workmanship was exquisite

371
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,800
so there's really a lot of attention

372
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:20,479
there this is a nature sanctuary there's

373
00:11:18,799 --> 00:11:21,919
one person's inspiration

374
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:24,079
built out of all found and recycled

375
00:11:21,919 --> 00:11:25,759
materials turf roof this is a

376
00:11:24,078 --> 00:11:27,039
house there's actually a whole bunch of

377
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:29,600
houses in this neighborhood and they're

378
00:11:27,039 --> 00:11:31,599
all built out of old whiskey barrels

379
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,800
remember this is scotland right so i

380
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,320
mean there was a company moving from

381
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:35,359
wood vats to metal bats and i can't

382
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,800
remember if they were giving them away

383
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,680
for free or they someone in finland

384
00:11:36,799 --> 00:11:39,120
bought them cheap and they were just

385
00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:40,319
sort of piling up in a corner until this

386
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,519
guy roger

387
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,200
dude and looked at him and said you know

388
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:44,560
i could i could live in our live house

389
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,240
so he built this house and now there's a

390
00:11:44,559 --> 00:11:48,639
couple two-story barrel houses it's like

391
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:51,278
out of a hobbit it's really amazing

392
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:52,399
um they also own this big hotel about

393
00:11:51,278 --> 00:11:53,679
five miles away

394
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:55,519
they bought in the mid-80s for about a

395
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:56,000
hundred and fifty thousand dollars if

396
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:57,360
you can believe

397
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,799
it and it was a wreck and they've been

398
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,000
renovating it ever since they have

399
00:11:58,799 --> 00:12:01,919
wonderful gardens

400
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,679
uh they weren't they're not really large

401
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:05,360
farms they but they do

402
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:06,799
provide and produce a lot of their own

403
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,440
food about 80 percent they do a lot of

404
00:12:06,799 --> 00:12:10,639
work with

405
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:12,639
csas in the region um

406
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:13,680
and finland is actually quite known for

407
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:15,519
their their

408
00:12:13,679 --> 00:12:16,958
gourmet meals there's a fin one cookbook

409
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:18,799
maybe some that's maybe some

410
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:20,000
how some people have heard about finland

411
00:12:18,799 --> 00:12:21,679
so on this program

412
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,919
and a lot of our programs the courses

413
00:12:21,679 --> 00:12:26,000
are really looking at our relationships

414
00:12:23,919 --> 00:12:27,599
i talk a lot about relational pedagogy

415
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,519
our relationships with each other so we

416
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,360
have a community dynamics course

417
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:33,919
communication skills all that and then

418
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:35,519
we have an ecology course

419
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:37,759
what is anika village what are the

420
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:38,560
successes challenges of finnhorn state

421
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:42,159
of the world stuff

422
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:44,399
and then also a worldview course

423
00:12:42,159 --> 00:12:45,439
to really deconstruct some of the

424
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:47,360
stories

425
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:49,120
and cultural values that got us to where

426
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:51,039
we are now

427
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:53,039
you know why how is it that we've become

428
00:12:51,039 --> 00:12:53,838
this juggernaut of destruction as a

429
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:56,078
species

430
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:57,279
and what are our options and how do we

431
00:12:56,078 --> 00:12:58,559
even think about that

432
00:12:57,278 --> 00:13:00,639
so it's really an opportunity for

433
00:12:58,559 --> 00:13:03,278
students to step back and reflect on

434
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:04,879
a lot of deep deep values the programs

435
00:13:03,278 --> 00:13:06,720
we go to the communities eco-villages we

436
00:13:04,879 --> 00:13:08,480
go to they're not religious communities

437
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,839
but i would say that they're spiritual

438
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:11,920
in the sense that they're really asking

439
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:13,680
those big questions meaning

440
00:13:11,919 --> 00:13:15,120
purpose why are we here what are we

441
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:17,039
going to do about it and then there's a

442
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,480
service course too to allow students an

443
00:13:17,039 --> 00:13:21,199
opportunity to really get involved

444
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:22,720
and do stuff so in israel there's a

445
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,240
there's actually a small group of

446
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,120
kibbutzim called the green kibbutz

447
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:28,159
movement

448
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:29,679
uh maybe a dozen

449
00:13:28,159 --> 00:13:31,199
a couple of them live are down in the

450
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:32,719
negev in the ira the desert

451
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,320
of israel so this is one this is

452
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,680
probably the most active of them called

453
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:38,320
kibbutz lothan

454
00:13:35,679 --> 00:13:39,039
and this is a reformed jewish kibbutzim

455
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,040
and

456
00:13:39,039 --> 00:13:43,039
they've been around for 20 or so years

457
00:13:41,039 --> 00:13:44,000
and you know they wanted to form a

458
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:45,278
kibbutz and so they went to the

459
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,159
government of israel and they said sure

460
00:13:45,278 --> 00:13:46,958
we'll give you some land and they're

461
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:48,719
like wait a minute we don't want

462
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:50,638
anything that's in dispute

463
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,920
any land in dispute they said finally in

464
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:53,360
the desert

465
00:13:51,919 --> 00:13:54,479
and they were there for like 10 years

466
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,360
you know and kind of just doing their

467
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,800
thing

468
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,480
and then they slowly started waking up

469
00:13:56,799 --> 00:13:59,198
to the fact that they were in the desert

470
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:01,440
and they're like

471
00:13:59,198 --> 00:14:02,958
why are we here and why do we have cows

472
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,720
this is kind of crazy you know

473
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:06,319
but they really took it on and they've

474
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:08,320
done a lot of work with permaculture is

475
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:10,000
that a familiar concept to most people

476
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:11,680
okay if it's not i can explain a little

477
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,440
bit later um they do

478
00:14:11,679 --> 00:14:15,120
they students have actually helped build

479
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,079
their own dormitories uh

480
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,839
you know they do a lot of work with

481
00:14:16,078 --> 00:14:19,679
natural building the government of

482
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:21,519
israel will build these like cement

483
00:14:19,679 --> 00:14:24,078
block houses which in the desert just

484
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:26,639
are awful buildings so these breathe

485
00:14:24,078 --> 00:14:28,159
they do a lot of work with solar and and

486
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:30,879
natural building

487
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:32,480
they have a wonderful bird sanctuary uh

488
00:14:30,879 --> 00:14:33,919
it's just a really amazing place but if

489
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,360
you get up into these hills and you look

490
00:14:33,919 --> 00:14:37,278
down it's just this oasis

491
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,480
it's just this little dot in the desert

492
00:14:37,278 --> 00:14:39,198
but they're really trying to figure out

493
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:42,480
how they can

494
00:14:39,198 --> 00:14:43,759
bring back life there um so

495
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,920
and on this course there's a peace and

496
00:14:43,759 --> 00:14:47,039
social justice pro of course the

497
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:47,919
students really have an opportunity to

498
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:49,919
get involved with

499
00:14:47,919 --> 00:14:51,679
uh palestinians arab israelis better

500
00:14:49,919 --> 00:14:53,120
ones and really try to see the situation

501
00:14:51,679 --> 00:14:55,439
through multiple lenses

502
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,639
that is what we feel how peace is going

503
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:58,000
to come to the region it's not about

504
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:59,839
who's right and who's wrong it's about

505
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,879
how many stories can we hold

506
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:04,800
at once there's a permaculture course

507
00:15:02,879 --> 00:15:06,399
appropriate technologies and there's

508
00:15:04,799 --> 00:15:07,838
also a communications course here but

509
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:11,039
we're trying to turn that into a

510
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:12,160
community economics course costa rica we

511
00:15:11,039 --> 00:15:13,919
have a program in the

512
00:15:12,159 --> 00:15:16,319
at the monteverdi institute in the cloud

513
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:19,759
forest tropical ecology

514
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:23,440
uh there's a spanish course there

515
00:15:19,759 --> 00:15:25,120
is a service learning course um

516
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:26,480
and did i say peace and social justice i

517
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:28,560
think those are the fourth

518
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:30,159
so this is a a semester program that

519
00:15:28,559 --> 00:15:31,758
we've been running in costa rica

520
00:15:30,159 --> 00:15:33,439
india this is another one of my favorite

521
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:35,519
places in the world this is a community

522
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:37,440
called oroville it's down in the south

523
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:38,879
uh three hours south of chennai very

524
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:41,199
close to ponetre right on the bay of

525
00:15:38,879 --> 00:15:43,278
bengal and it's a large community it's

526
00:15:41,198 --> 00:15:45,039
about 2 200 people

527
00:15:43,278 --> 00:15:46,320
about 45 different nationalities

528
00:15:45,039 --> 00:15:48,159
incredibly international

529
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,920
and they are building as they call it a

530
00:15:48,159 --> 00:15:51,759
city the earth needs

531
00:15:49,919 --> 00:15:53,679
a sustainable city their dream is to

532
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:55,039
become a city for 50 000 people

533
00:15:53,679 --> 00:15:57,039
it's some it's a large area it's about

534
00:15:55,039 --> 00:16:00,319
fourteen square kilometers

535
00:15:57,039 --> 00:16:01,838
and about a little less than half of

536
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:03,360
that membership are from they're from

537
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:04,160
india and the rest are from around the

538
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:08,000
world

539
00:16:04,159 --> 00:16:10,559
um and so orville is essentially this

540
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,399
big experiment uh the there were two

541
00:16:10,559 --> 00:16:13,599
founders srirabindo and a woman mirror

542
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:16,078
alfalfa one thing that

543
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:17,519
sri abindo died in 1950 the one thing

544
00:16:16,078 --> 00:16:20,879
that he talked about a lot

545
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:22,959
was how he believed humanity is on the

546
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:25,198
brink of an evolutionary leap

547
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:26,799
in consciousness and he wasn't talking

548
00:16:25,198 --> 00:16:27,278
about like the 60s or just you know

549
00:16:26,799 --> 00:16:29,120
certain

550
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:30,639
but he's talking about this time and i

551
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,120
like to believe that you know we have to

552
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:32,799
really

553
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,839
think about how do we change how we

554
00:16:32,799 --> 00:16:34,399
think about things if we're going to

555
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:36,959
survive

556
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:38,639
as a species and so orville is basically

557
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:40,399
made up of people who say yeah

558
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:42,240
and i believe that i want to believe

559
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:43,519
that what do we do

560
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:46,079
how do we do that you know how would we

561
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:49,120
create a city a vessel a container

562
00:16:46,078 --> 00:16:52,000
for this new consciousness to emerge so

563
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:53,759
it's really this radical sometimes

564
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,440
chaotic experiment

565
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:56,879
they do reinvent the wheel a lot but

566
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,680
they're very creative and they're trying

567
00:16:56,879 --> 00:16:59,919
to do different things

568
00:16:57,679 --> 00:17:01,359
there's like 13 different organic farms

569
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:03,439
using all different methods

570
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:04,400
there's french intensive there's there's

571
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,240
one farm based on

572
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,839
fukuoka's one straw revolution from

573
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,439
japan um

574
00:17:07,838 --> 00:17:12,000
permaculture there's a lot of stuff

575
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:14,079
going on this building down here

576
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,199
looks like the epcot center but it's a

577
00:17:14,078 --> 00:17:16,558
meditation hall

578
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:18,480
and it's a place for people to go and

579
00:17:16,558 --> 00:17:20,240
just be silent it's not a place for

580
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:22,000
religion or dogma or even groups it's

581
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:25,038
just a place to be silent

582
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,558
this is a big solar dish probably twice

583
00:17:25,038 --> 00:17:28,879
the size of this room

584
00:17:26,558 --> 00:17:30,160
and it collects the sun's rays and it

585
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:32,400
super heats water

586
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:33,519
the steam of which is used to cook 1200

587
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,440
meals a day

588
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:36,879
so this is like community scale

589
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:38,640
appropriate technology it's not

590
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:41,520
technology for an individual it's not

591
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:43,440
technology for the a metropolitan area

592
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:44,160
how do we create technology that we can

593
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,880
live with

594
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:47,600
in groups and i think that's an area

595
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:49,039
that is

596
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:50,000
needs a lot of development and i think

597
00:17:49,038 --> 00:17:51,599
that's one of the places that

598
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,359
ecovillages are really pushing the edge

599
00:17:51,599 --> 00:17:55,119
there's nothing i've ever found in anika

600
00:17:53,359 --> 00:17:56,959
village in terms of technology

601
00:17:55,119 --> 00:17:58,079
that you can't find being done better

602
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,440
elsewhere i mean you know there are

603
00:17:58,079 --> 00:18:00,000
better windmills elsewhere there are

604
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,840
better

605
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,200
organic farms there are better leeds

606
00:18:01,839 --> 00:18:05,279
buildings and all that

607
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,720
ecovillages aren't pushing the edge of

608
00:18:05,279 --> 00:18:08,160
individual technologies

609
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:10,640
what ecovillages are doing is they're

610
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:13,440
saying how do we put the pieces together

611
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:15,440
into cultures into stories into into

612
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:17,038
real life communities where we can live

613
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,960
these lives because that's where we need

614
00:18:17,038 --> 00:18:20,079
to go and because of that they're

615
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,120
looking at how do we do this

616
00:18:20,079 --> 00:18:22,960
economically

617
00:18:21,119 --> 00:18:24,558
uh and ways that fit for us and the

618
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:27,200
environment

619
00:18:24,558 --> 00:18:28,160
okay so and then we have a couple short

620
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,519
programs

621
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:31,120
a lot of them around permaculture if

622
00:18:29,519 --> 00:18:32,720
you're not familiar with permaculture

623
00:18:31,119 --> 00:18:34,959
it's a system of ecological

624
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,759
design basically asking how does nature

625
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,200
design

626
00:18:35,759 --> 00:18:38,879
what are the principles of design that

627
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,480
we can discern from nature and then how

628
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:42,880
would we apply those principles

629
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:43,759
to the human built environment started

630
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,600
in australia

631
00:18:43,759 --> 00:18:47,200
gosh what maybe 40 years ago i think i'm

632
00:18:45,599 --> 00:18:48,639
not exactly sure it started as a

633
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,400
concatenation of permanent

634
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:51,679
agriculture how do we create

635
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:54,640
agricultural systems

636
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:56,240
that don't need constant human input but

637
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:59,520
that are just naturally

638
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:00,960
uh sustainable and it's evolved into now

639
00:18:59,519 --> 00:19:02,400
today it's more often thought of as

640
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:04,079
permanent culture so it's be

641
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:06,480
it's gone beyond agriculture and it's

642
00:19:04,079 --> 00:19:07,519
looking at the built environment and

643
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:10,640
social systems

644
00:19:07,519 --> 00:19:12,079
and economics even and it's become quite

645
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:13,200
popular around the world i've lost track

646
00:19:12,079 --> 00:19:15,359
but i would guess

647
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:17,038
probably 40 or 50 000 people around the

648
00:19:15,359 --> 00:19:17,599
world have gone through a permaculture

649
00:19:17,038 --> 00:19:19,919
design

650
00:19:17,599 --> 00:19:20,959
course and so there is a fairly

651
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:22,960
structured curriculum

652
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:24,240
we expand on that because we base these

653
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:26,558
in communities and we want to really

654
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:27,919
include that aspect as well

655
00:19:26,558 --> 00:19:29,599
but we're really happy to be able to do

656
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:30,320
that and so one of the places we go to

657
00:19:29,599 --> 00:19:32,319
is a

658
00:19:30,319 --> 00:19:33,759
community called eco central epec and

659
00:19:32,319 --> 00:19:37,279
it's in the serato of brazil

660
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:39,119
southwest of brasilia and

661
00:19:37,279 --> 00:19:42,160
this is a community that was designed

662
00:19:39,119 --> 00:19:43,759
using these permaculture principles

663
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:46,080
and then we have a six-week program in

664
00:19:43,759 --> 00:19:47,359
peru you remember that that's line i

665
00:19:46,079 --> 00:19:48,960
showed you before with sort of resource

666
00:19:47,359 --> 00:19:50,000
rich in resource poor if you think about

667
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,679
it that way there's really two

668
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:55,599
directions toward ecovillages

669
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:57,519
in the resource-rich areas like here

670
00:19:55,599 --> 00:20:00,000
people are developing equal villages

671
00:19:57,519 --> 00:20:01,599
saying how do we maintain a high quality

672
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,558
lifestyle but reduce our footprint

673
00:20:01,599 --> 00:20:04,558
ecovillage

674
00:20:02,558 --> 00:20:05,599
is an excellent example of that right

675
00:20:04,558 --> 00:20:07,759
and then there's

676
00:20:05,599 --> 00:20:09,199
uh there's eco villages from resource

677
00:20:07,759 --> 00:20:09,599
poor worlds where they're saying how do

678
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,798
we

679
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:13,599
increase our quality of life but

680
00:20:10,798 --> 00:20:14,879
maintain a light footprint so that's an

681
00:20:13,599 --> 00:20:16,240
example in peru

682
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,600
india is really interesting because

683
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,480
india is kind of in oracle they're kind

684
00:20:17,599 --> 00:20:19,918
of doing both

685
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,599
because it's so international there is

686
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:23,120
sort of that western mentality but

687
00:20:21,599 --> 00:20:24,480
there's also a very strong indigenous

688
00:20:23,119 --> 00:20:26,079
mentality there too

689
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:28,720
so here there's a six-week program we do

690
00:20:26,079 --> 00:20:30,319
a course in spanish and quechua which is

691
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:32,079
the non-colonial language

692
00:20:30,319 --> 00:20:34,319
and also looking at biocultural

693
00:20:32,079 --> 00:20:37,359
regeneration so shamanism

694
00:20:34,319 --> 00:20:39,359
and fair trade coffee

695
00:20:37,359 --> 00:20:41,038
and they work with what are called

696
00:20:39,359 --> 00:20:42,558
mountain microorganisms i don't know a

697
00:20:41,038 --> 00:20:43,038
whole lot about them but they i think

698
00:20:42,558 --> 00:20:44,720
they

699
00:20:43,038 --> 00:20:48,400
they cultivate them for mushrooms in the

700
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:50,400
forest and then it's used as a way to

701
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:52,000
fertilize the fields and they see it as

702
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,280
a potential alternative to slash and

703
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,440
burn agriculture

704
00:20:53,279 --> 00:20:57,119
so they do a lot of work around that too

705
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,640
so it's a really amazing opportunity in

706
00:20:57,119 --> 00:21:01,519
the high amazon peru

707
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:02,000
and then this is where i live at in the

708
00:21:01,519 --> 00:21:03,519
western

709
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,880
in western massachusetts is a community

710
00:21:03,519 --> 00:21:06,240
called sirius and notice how it's

711
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:08,960
spelled it's like the dogs turn up

712
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:09,839
serious and it's a spin-off of fin horn

713
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:13,038
and so

714
00:21:09,839 --> 00:21:15,759
sirius has been around six seventy-eight

715
00:21:13,038 --> 00:21:17,279
so is that maybe about 34-35 years old

716
00:21:15,759 --> 00:21:19,038
and it's a smaller community there's

717
00:21:17,279 --> 00:21:22,000
maybe 20 members but there's a larger

718
00:21:19,038 --> 00:21:23,599
wider community around it of maybe 150.

719
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,519
this is the community center the back

720
00:21:23,599 --> 00:21:27,439
side with a wonderful greenhouse

721
00:21:25,519 --> 00:21:28,960
and this is the upstairs here and so

722
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:30,400
this is the classroom that the students

723
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,038
take over for three weeks it's really

724
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:34,480
wonderful

725
00:21:31,038 --> 00:21:35,839
and students go into design teams

726
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,960
and they learn these permaculture

727
00:21:35,839 --> 00:21:38,399
principles and then they work with

728
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,600
clients either at sirius or in the

729
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:42,798
surrounding area

730
00:21:39,599 --> 00:21:44,798
of applying these principles to the

731
00:21:42,798 --> 00:21:46,319
needs that are expressed

732
00:21:44,798 --> 00:21:47,918
and then we have a january program in

733
00:21:46,319 --> 00:21:49,678
mexico at a community called way way

734
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:50,960
kyoto they have a fun story they were

735
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:53,038
basically uh

736
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:54,319
traveling troubadours they were doing

737
00:21:53,038 --> 00:21:55,919
performance art uh

738
00:21:54,319 --> 00:21:57,359
and theater throughout central and south

739
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:59,520
america i think they were called the

740
00:21:57,359 --> 00:22:00,959
the illuminated elephant or something

741
00:21:59,519 --> 00:22:02,079
and they were going around on buses and

742
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:04,960
then they got tired of that

743
00:22:02,079 --> 00:22:06,720
and they settled here in mexico and they

744
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:09,200
got really good at decision making

745
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:10,558
and and facilitation facilitating group

746
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,600
process and so that's what we do our

747
00:22:10,558 --> 00:22:13,678
course on there

748
00:22:11,599 --> 00:22:15,918
looking at conflict and communication

749
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:17,519
styles and decision making etc

750
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:19,038
but there's a still strong art and

751
00:22:17,519 --> 00:22:21,440
theater focus there

752
00:22:19,038 --> 00:22:22,798
and then when we can we get to australia

753
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,240
the birthplace of permaculture to this

754
00:22:22,798 --> 00:22:25,918
community called crystal waters

755
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:27,679
which is another community design using

756
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:29,600
these principles um

757
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:31,360
there's various reasons why we haven't

758
00:22:29,599 --> 00:22:33,119
been there for a while max lindager

759
00:22:31,359 --> 00:22:34,558
is one of the best permaculture teachers

760
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:35,439
i know he's been teaching it for like 30

761
00:22:34,558 --> 00:22:37,759
years

762
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:38,720
okay so that gives you a a little kind

763
00:22:37,759 --> 00:22:40,158
of visual

764
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:42,400
sense of some of the ecovillages that

765
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:43,919
are out there i want to shift now and

766
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:46,480
talk a little bit about why

767
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:48,080
ecovillages make really good campuses

768
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:50,640
for sustainability education

769
00:22:48,079 --> 00:22:53,199
is there any any thoughts questions up

770
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:53,200
until now

771
00:22:53,279 --> 00:22:59,119
um i noticed in the upcoming

772
00:22:57,279 --> 00:23:00,720
eco villages that you were gonna work

773
00:22:59,119 --> 00:23:02,239
with there was a

774
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:04,079
one of the ones that was twin oaks is

775
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:06,079
that the one in virginia yes

776
00:23:04,079 --> 00:23:07,918
yeah that's a little lower on our radar

777
00:23:06,079 --> 00:23:09,359
right now um originally i was thinking

778
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:10,480
of it'd be great to do a program based

779
00:23:09,359 --> 00:23:11,918
at earth haven

780
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:13,759
in north carolina and then maybe do

781
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:15,440
trips to twin oaks and the farm

782
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:17,200
i think that would be a possible thing

783
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:18,880
the problem is is it's pretty expensive

784
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,720
to run a program in the u.s yeah and so

785
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:22,400
it actually cost about the same

786
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:23,440
as a program in india and you talk to a

787
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:26,240
student like well you could go to

788
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:29,038
virginia or india

789
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:29,679
and so it's been nice it is it's it's

790
00:23:29,038 --> 00:23:32,720
hard to

791
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:36,640
attract people right yeah yeah

792
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:38,159
anything else yeah

793
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:39,919
to bounce off that are you finding that

794
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:41,200
students internationally are interested

795
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:42,960
in coming to the us

796
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:44,640
um they are occasionally we haven't

797
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:46,480
that's a whole other world

798
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,679
that we haven't really we haven't looked

799
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:50,079
at um

800
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:51,600
that if we were to develop more we do

801
00:23:50,079 --> 00:23:52,720
want to develop a semester program

802
00:23:51,599 --> 00:23:54,959
actually locally

803
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:56,798
uh at sirius and in the pioneer valley

804
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:58,960
that area the happy valley the tofu

805
00:23:56,798 --> 00:24:02,720
curtain

806
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:04,558
massachusetts and if we were to do that

807
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:06,159
we were thinking both to connect more

808
00:24:04,558 --> 00:24:07,759
deeply with the five colleges umass

809
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:09,039
amherst and the four colleges around it

810
00:24:07,759 --> 00:24:12,240
smith mount holyoke

811
00:24:09,038 --> 00:24:14,798
amherst and hampshire thank you

812
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:15,919
um and we thought maybe that would be a

813
00:24:14,798 --> 00:24:17,519
really interesting opportunity to

814
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:18,320
attract international students to come

815
00:24:17,519 --> 00:24:22,639
to that

816
00:24:18,319 --> 00:24:24,558
so yeah anything else

817
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:26,000
okay so let's talk just for a few

818
00:24:24,558 --> 00:24:27,599
minutes and then we just open up for

819
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,679
some discussion around

820
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:31,119
uh what i want to do is sort of dissect

821
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:32,798
the hidden curriculum

822
00:24:31,119 --> 00:24:34,479
between academia and ecovillages and

823
00:24:32,798 --> 00:24:36,079
what do i mean by this

824
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:37,759
it's talked about in a number of ways

825
00:24:36,079 --> 00:24:39,439
this guy chet bauer talked about the

826
00:24:37,759 --> 00:24:40,558
meta-narratives of the systems that

827
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:43,600
we're involved with

828
00:24:40,558 --> 00:24:44,798
you know when you go to cornell you're

829
00:24:43,599 --> 00:24:46,558
learning a lot hopefully

830
00:24:44,798 --> 00:24:48,480
in the classes you take but i would

831
00:24:46,558 --> 00:24:51,599
suggest you're also learning a lot

832
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:53,360
from just participating in the system

833
00:24:51,599 --> 00:24:55,199
there is a hidden curriculum that we

834
00:24:53,359 --> 00:24:57,119
learn just by being a part of

835
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,480
groups and systems so i mean simple

836
00:24:57,119 --> 00:25:00,639
things you know sit up straight

837
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:01,599
pencil down eyes ahead don't cheat you

838
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:04,240
know all these things

839
00:25:01,599 --> 00:25:05,278
are rules that we learn by being part of

840
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:07,519
the system

841
00:25:05,278 --> 00:25:09,359
and so what i want to do is sort of make

842
00:25:07,519 --> 00:25:10,480
a comparison between what i see as some

843
00:25:09,359 --> 00:25:12,798
of those the hidden

844
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:14,159
agenda hidden curriculum of academia

845
00:25:12,798 --> 00:25:15,759
versus ecovillages and

846
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:17,360
before i do that i just want to say i'm

847
00:25:15,759 --> 00:25:19,919
really painting the

848
00:25:17,359 --> 00:25:21,759
the the ends of the spectrum here so it

849
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:23,120
may be a little provocative i hope it is

850
00:25:21,759 --> 00:25:24,158
you know and i hope you don't agree with

851
00:25:23,119 --> 00:25:25,839
everything i say

852
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:27,278
but i just want to put it out there and

853
00:25:25,839 --> 00:25:28,879
maybe some of it will resonate and some

854
00:25:27,278 --> 00:25:29,679
of it won't and we'll we can talk about

855
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:32,000
it okay

856
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:33,600
so just to get into it for example

857
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,759
academia is conventional

858
00:25:33,599 --> 00:25:37,759
right i mean the basic structure of

859
00:25:35,759 --> 00:25:40,640
academia has not changed since

860
00:25:37,759 --> 00:25:42,240
the middle ages yeah you know you just

861
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,559
walk around and a lot of the structures

862
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,919
of

863
00:25:42,558 --> 00:25:46,000
how things are here things are slow to

864
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:48,240
move they're very bureaucratic

865
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,119
i know i felt that when i was at cornell

866
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:52,079
um

867
00:25:49,119 --> 00:25:52,879
whereas ecovillages are experimental

868
00:25:52,079 --> 00:25:56,000
right there

869
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:57,600
they are laboratories they if something

870
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,159
doesn't work you just can shift on a

871
00:25:57,599 --> 00:25:59,839
dime

872
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:02,240
and so they tend to be a little bit more

873
00:25:59,839 --> 00:26:02,959
nimble about how to think about things

874
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:06,240
and how to

875
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:07,360
how to look at things okay academia is

876
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:10,159
hierarchical

877
00:26:07,359 --> 00:26:12,479
right i mean power emanates from the

878
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:13,120
president and provos down to deans and

879
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:15,839
faculty

880
00:26:13,119 --> 00:26:16,879
and you know students are at the low run

881
00:26:15,839 --> 00:26:20,158
here right

882
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:24,320
um and it really is telling a story of

883
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:26,960
power over submission to authority

884
00:26:24,319 --> 00:26:29,119
and so it's not such a big leap to be in

885
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:32,159
an institution like this and then go out

886
00:26:29,119 --> 00:26:34,239
and say well we have to subjugate nature

887
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:35,440
we have to apply that story that i

888
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:37,120
learned viscerally through

889
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:38,960
participating in this institution to

890
00:26:37,119 --> 00:26:41,439
what i'm doing in the natural world

891
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:43,120
right whereas ecovillages tend to be

892
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:44,000
more heteroarchical that is a word i

893
00:26:43,119 --> 00:26:46,399
looked it up

894
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:49,278
um and so people in inca villages tend

895
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:52,159
to interact more on a peer level

896
00:26:49,278 --> 00:26:53,599
and you know you you there's not so much

897
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:57,120
uh a power over

898
00:26:53,599 --> 00:26:58,399
uh it's really working with uh academic

899
00:26:57,119 --> 00:27:00,319
whoops sorry yeah academia is

900
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:02,000
competitive through and through right i

901
00:27:00,319 --> 00:27:03,439
felt this a lot at cornell it was a

902
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,919
great place it is a great place

903
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:06,720
but i felt it intensely competitive so

904
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:09,759
students for

905
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:13,038
grades right faculty for tenure grants

906
00:27:09,759 --> 00:27:16,158
recognition schools for endowments uh

907
00:27:13,038 --> 00:27:17,759
you know and recognition so it's just it

908
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:19,520
infiltrates it's throughout the whole

909
00:27:17,759 --> 00:27:21,679
system and

910
00:27:19,519 --> 00:27:23,359
not to say that competition is

911
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:24,240
completely foreign villages but they

912
00:27:23,359 --> 00:27:27,119
tend to be

913
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:27,839
more cooperative they tend to say how is

914
00:27:27,119 --> 00:27:30,158
the success

915
00:27:27,839 --> 00:27:30,959
of the individual tied to the success of

916
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:33,520
the whole

917
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:34,000
how can we really support each other and

918
00:27:33,519 --> 00:27:36,639
and

919
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,159
you know the idea of cheating doesn't

920
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:39,600
make sense in the real world it's called

921
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:41,200
collaboration you know it's like

922
00:27:39,599 --> 00:27:42,879
how to and yet we come out of schools

923
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,440
thinking you can't you can't trade you

924
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:45,440
know

925
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:46,480
information but that's where what really

926
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:50,480
happens and that's how

927
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:53,038
we move forward academia is fragmented

928
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:57,278
right we talk about this silo mentality

929
00:27:53,038 --> 00:28:00,158
in ecovillage in academia

930
00:27:57,278 --> 00:28:01,278
and we talk about rigor and when i think

931
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:02,320
of that i think of sort of two

932
00:28:01,278 --> 00:28:03,919
dimensions of rigor

933
00:28:02,319 --> 00:28:05,839
in traditional academia there's very

934
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:07,679
much a vertical rigor and so it's like

935
00:28:05,839 --> 00:28:09,678
how much can you dive into

936
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:10,720
one topic and really dig down as far as

937
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:13,519
you can go into one

938
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:14,880
particular sub sub topic which is great

939
00:28:13,519 --> 00:28:15,679
i mean i'm not denying that's

940
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:17,120
interesting stuff

941
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:18,960
but all the interesting stuff that i

942
00:28:17,119 --> 00:28:20,479
know about happening in academia is

943
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:23,038
almost all transdisciplinary

944
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:23,599
it's all happening across the fields and

945
00:28:23,038 --> 00:28:26,720
so

946
00:28:23,599 --> 00:28:29,119
ecovillages are inherently looking at

947
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:30,159
a more lateral rigor it's not to say

948
00:28:29,119 --> 00:28:32,959
that there's any

949
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:34,880
less quality of engagement there's any

950
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:36,720
less critical reflection

951
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:38,799
but it's looking at how do we bridge

952
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:40,880
these disciplines how do we think across

953
00:28:38,798 --> 00:28:42,000
ideas you know you put up a windmill and

954
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:43,679
what are you talking about you're

955
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,398
talking about engineering you're talking

956
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:46,720
about

957
00:28:44,398 --> 00:28:48,000
regional planning you're talking about

958
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:49,600
um

959
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,599
social systems and decision making and

960
00:28:49,599 --> 00:28:53,439
governance i mean all these disciplines

961
00:28:51,599 --> 00:28:54,158
come to bear in the natural in the real

962
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:57,278
world

963
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:58,000
and so let's just use those as real life

964
00:28:57,278 --> 00:29:01,679
experiments

965
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,679
and and opportunities to learn

966
00:29:01,759 --> 00:29:04,879
academia is proximal what do i mean by

967
00:29:04,398 --> 00:29:07,759
that

968
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:08,320
well you know in schools from from the

969
00:29:07,759 --> 00:29:09,919
beginning

970
00:29:08,319 --> 00:29:12,558
up through mostly it changes a little

971
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:15,919
bit but through college and grad school

972
00:29:12,558 --> 00:29:17,200
we tend to be age segregated we tend to

973
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:19,679
have very mediated

974
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:21,120
relationships so you are all in a class

975
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:22,320
together you have relationship with your

976
00:29:21,119 --> 00:29:24,079
faculty maybe

977
00:29:22,319 --> 00:29:26,000
a faculty advisor but they're all

978
00:29:24,079 --> 00:29:28,240
through certain ways of being

979
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,119
and you kind of know the rules right

980
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:33,200
whereas

981
00:29:29,119 --> 00:29:36,319
in in eco villages they tend to be more

982
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:37,759
intimate relationships and people

983
00:29:36,319 --> 00:29:39,038
interact with each other in a lot of

984
00:29:37,759 --> 00:29:40,720
different ways you might be

985
00:29:39,038 --> 00:29:42,640
farming with someone one day you might

986
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:44,159
be cooking with them another day or in a

987
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:46,000
in a meeting or a decision making

988
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:46,799
process or something and you get to know

989
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,759
people

990
00:29:46,798 --> 00:29:51,839
in the fullness of life and i think

991
00:29:49,759 --> 00:29:53,038
that's really important and

992
00:29:51,839 --> 00:29:54,558
remember when i said when i started

993
00:29:53,038 --> 00:29:56,480
traveling to communities i had this sort

994
00:29:54,558 --> 00:29:57,519
of epiphany when i when i started going

995
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:00,960
to these communities

996
00:29:57,519 --> 00:30:02,480
i think what was happening was

997
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:05,840
it was almost like there was this need

998
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:07,519
in me that i didn't even know was there

999
00:30:05,839 --> 00:30:09,119
and it started getting filled up and it

1000
00:30:07,519 --> 00:30:10,319
was a very confusing experience for a

1001
00:30:09,119 --> 00:30:12,959
little while and what i

1002
00:30:10,319 --> 00:30:14,398
now label that need as is community it's

1003
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:18,798
belonging

1004
00:30:14,398 --> 00:30:20,558
and i really think that we have lost

1005
00:30:18,798 --> 00:30:22,639
a sense of community at least in the

1006
00:30:20,558 --> 00:30:25,678
western world i think we've lost a sense

1007
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:27,679
of community so profoundly

1008
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:29,600
that most of us don't even think of it

1009
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:32,000
as something to strive for

1010
00:30:29,599 --> 00:30:33,759
to look for you know when i was at

1011
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,119
cornell you know a lot of late-night

1012
00:30:33,759 --> 00:30:36,720
discussions around

1013
00:30:35,119 --> 00:30:38,079
how we want to live our lives what kind

1014
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:40,240
of parents we want to be what kind of

1015
00:30:38,079 --> 00:30:42,240
work we want to do in the world

1016
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:43,519
and um you know maybe we might need to

1017
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:45,120
be making lists well you know what do

1018
00:30:43,519 --> 00:30:47,200
you want to get out of life

1019
00:30:45,119 --> 00:30:48,719
and if you think about that you know

1020
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:50,240
what shows up on those lists a lot well

1021
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:52,480
i want to i want a good job

1022
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:54,000
i want a loving partner living in a nice

1023
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:56,558
house

1024
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:58,319
opportunities to travel maybe learn more

1025
00:30:56,558 --> 00:30:59,759
you know all that's great but the idea

1026
00:30:58,319 --> 00:31:02,879
of belonging

1027
00:30:59,759 --> 00:31:04,079
to a community i mean honestly doesn't

1028
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:05,840
it sound a little

1029
00:31:04,079 --> 00:31:07,519
old-fashioned it's almost vaguely

1030
00:31:05,839 --> 00:31:09,439
religious you know it's like

1031
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:10,960
i don't know it sounds a little scary

1032
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:12,399
but really you know and a lot of people

1033
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:13,600
when i talk about eco villages they're

1034
00:31:12,398 --> 00:31:15,199
like yeah all right but you know they're

1035
00:31:13,599 --> 00:31:16,558
really kind of weird

1036
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:18,240
i mean they are a little weird i'll

1037
00:31:16,558 --> 00:31:19,440
grant them you know

1038
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:21,120
they're they're irrelevant they're

1039
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,600
marginal they really don't have anything

1040
00:31:21,119 --> 00:31:24,639
to say

1041
00:31:21,599 --> 00:31:27,278
to our society and when i hear that

1042
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:29,360
i i ask i reflect back and say you know

1043
00:31:27,278 --> 00:31:32,079
i encourage you to take a step back

1044
00:31:29,359 --> 00:31:33,199
and take a more evolutionary perspective

1045
00:31:32,079 --> 00:31:36,558
and remember

1046
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:37,919
that for 99.9 of our evolutionary

1047
00:31:36,558 --> 00:31:41,119
history

1048
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:42,960
we lived in community we lived in tribes

1049
00:31:41,119 --> 00:31:44,239
right i mean this is in our bones it's

1050
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:46,720
in our genes

1051
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:47,359
we are viscerally wired to be social

1052
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:49,200
animals

1053
00:31:47,359 --> 00:31:50,558
and it's really only been since the

1054
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:53,759
industrial revolution

1055
00:31:50,558 --> 00:31:55,278
that we've gotten away from that why how

1056
00:31:53,759 --> 00:31:57,519
well because we've accessed the cheap

1057
00:31:55,278 --> 00:31:59,599
energy yeah i can live in the suburbs

1058
00:31:57,519 --> 00:32:01,359
and i can drive to the mall i can go get

1059
00:31:59,599 --> 00:32:03,519
my food at the grocery store i don't

1060
00:32:01,359 --> 00:32:06,479
have to interact with anyone

1061
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:06,480
because it's cheap

1062
00:32:06,558 --> 00:32:10,079
but i think we've lost something

1063
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:13,038
profound in that

1064
00:32:10,079 --> 00:32:14,720
you know and so when i started traveling

1065
00:32:13,038 --> 00:32:18,879
to communities it was like

1066
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:21,519
wow oh yeah there's a sense of belonging

1067
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:21,919
and and that's what i see sort of wake

1068
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:23,679
up

1069
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:25,038
in the students that go on these

1070
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:26,159
programs too or spend time in eco

1071
00:32:25,038 --> 00:32:29,440
villages

1072
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:31,600
and to me it that's not just about

1073
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:32,960
a sense of well-being and happiness

1074
00:32:31,599 --> 00:32:34,639
around thinking about

1075
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:36,880
community and belonging i also think

1076
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:38,159
it's fundamental to the sustainability

1077
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:40,880
of our planet

1078
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:41,760
i i don't think we could do what we do

1079
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:43,679
to each other

1080
00:32:41,759 --> 00:32:44,879
i don't think we could do what we do to

1081
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:47,840
the planet

1082
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:50,080
if we fundamentally felt i belong here

1083
00:32:47,839 --> 00:32:53,038
you belong here that desert belongs here

1084
00:32:50,079 --> 00:32:53,759
we have to figure this out together you

1085
00:32:53,038 --> 00:32:56,640
know if i

1086
00:32:53,759 --> 00:32:57,919
if i had to boil this all down to one

1087
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:01,038
word

1088
00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:02,480
it would be interdependence actually

1089
00:33:01,038 --> 00:33:04,798
how many of you ever heard of tiknot han

1090
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:06,399
the buddhist monk a couple people

1091
00:33:04,798 --> 00:33:07,759
anything he's written is worth reading

1092
00:33:06,398 --> 00:33:08,798
actually let me let me get back to that

1093
00:33:07,759 --> 00:33:11,599
because i think it's

1094
00:33:08,798 --> 00:33:13,038
going on i'll i'll mention in a minute

1095
00:33:11,599 --> 00:33:15,918
down here

1096
00:33:13,038 --> 00:33:16,558
so getting back to uh well let me just

1097
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:18,000
say so

1098
00:33:16,558 --> 00:33:20,319
community i really think it's it's

1099
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:22,398
foundational and

1100
00:33:20,319 --> 00:33:24,319
it does exist in academia you know a lot

1101
00:33:22,398 --> 00:33:25,839
of people come to college to have that

1102
00:33:24,319 --> 00:33:27,200
sense of the academic community

1103
00:33:25,839 --> 00:33:28,879
so i'm not dissing that i think that

1104
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:31,278
there's something valuable there i just

1105
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:33,760
say i just think there's so much more

1106
00:33:31,278 --> 00:33:34,720
and i encourage each of you wherever you

1107
00:33:33,759 --> 00:33:36,798
are in your lives

1108
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:38,558
to be thinking about who's your tribe

1109
00:33:36,798 --> 00:33:39,759
you know who do you belong to who

1110
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:41,038
belongs to you

1111
00:33:39,759 --> 00:33:43,119
because i really think we're moving

1112
00:33:41,038 --> 00:33:44,960
toward a place when that's essential and

1113
00:33:43,119 --> 00:33:48,239
we need to be thinking about that

1114
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:50,079
so okay academia it's very theoretical

1115
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:54,079
right it's very um

1116
00:33:50,079 --> 00:33:56,398
armchair theoretician um you know

1117
00:33:54,079 --> 00:33:58,480
it tends to train people in their heads

1118
00:33:56,398 --> 00:33:59,119
i wrote a blog entry a while ago that if

1119
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:01,440
i

1120
00:33:59,119 --> 00:34:02,719
had to choose blindly between two

1121
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:04,399
candidates to teach on one of our

1122
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:06,159
programs and one was a master's level

1123
00:34:04,398 --> 00:34:09,039
and one was a phd

1124
00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:10,398
i'd probably choose the masters and that

1125
00:34:09,039 --> 00:34:13,599
doesn't make me many friends

1126
00:34:10,398 --> 00:34:16,319
in academia but the reason is is that

1127
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:17,679
master's level folks tend to get the

1128
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:19,039
degree because they want to get out

1129
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:22,559
there and do stuff

1130
00:34:19,039 --> 00:34:24,800
right people who go on to phds

1131
00:34:22,559 --> 00:34:25,838
tend to be a little more in their heads

1132
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:27,519
and i'm making

1133
00:34:25,838 --> 00:34:30,078
grand generalizations here okay so

1134
00:34:27,519 --> 00:34:30,878
forgive me i i know i've got a phd

1135
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:33,839
myself

1136
00:34:30,878 --> 00:34:34,719
um but i i think and and phd programs

1137
00:34:33,838 --> 00:34:37,838
even tend to

1138
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:39,199
train armchair pediatricians right and

1139
00:34:37,838 --> 00:34:41,119
in my graduate program

1140
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:42,480
in minnesota i was astonished it was a

1141
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:43,358
program in child development and school

1142
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:45,599
psychology

1143
00:34:43,358 --> 00:34:46,799
how little of it had to do with being

1144
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:49,519
with kids

1145
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:50,159
i mean they were it was all laboratory

1146
00:34:49,519 --> 00:34:51,679
and it was

1147
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:53,760
crazy and the best thing i did in my

1148
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:55,200
graduate program besides my dissertation

1149
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:57,359
was i got an early ed teaching

1150
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:58,799
certificate and i actually went into the

1151
00:34:57,358 --> 00:35:00,639
preschool and i

1152
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:02,160
and i worked with the kids and all my

1153
00:35:00,639 --> 00:35:02,879
colleagues were like why would you do

1154
00:35:02,159 --> 00:35:04,319
that

1155
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:06,480
you know it's kind of messy you know

1156
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:09,519
like yeah but it was fun so i mean

1157
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:13,119
i think there is this weird

1158
00:35:09,519 --> 00:35:15,119
kind of separation between what we

1159
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:16,720
think of in academia and what is

1160
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:18,640
actually in the real world

1161
00:35:16,719 --> 00:35:20,480
so what does it say is the meaning of

1162
00:35:18,639 --> 00:35:21,598
life true false multiple choice essay or

1163
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:24,400
what you know

1164
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:27,680
uh equal villages are applied if it

1165
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:30,079
doesn't work you try something else

1166
00:35:27,679 --> 00:35:31,598
it's really about how do we bring this

1167
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:35,280
knowledge into

1168
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:36,880
real life academia

1169
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:38,400
is secular so i'll get back to this

1170
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:41,519
concept in a second so

1171
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:44,000
you know there's this idea

1172
00:35:41,519 --> 00:35:45,519
this myth of objectivity that we can

1173
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,239
somehow study the world but not

1174
00:35:45,519 --> 00:35:51,599
influence or be a part of it

1175
00:35:48,239 --> 00:35:52,879
and in ecovillages i use the word

1176
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:54,640
spiritual but

1177
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:56,400
i know it's a loaded term but i think of

1178
00:35:54,639 --> 00:35:58,159
it in terms of the big questions again

1179
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:01,760
why are we here purpose meaning

1180
00:35:58,159 --> 00:36:03,598
and to me again the word that i would

1181
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:05,599
use is interdependence or better yet

1182
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:07,119
the word that take not han coin which is

1183
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:10,400
inter-being

1184
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:11,920
and if you hear that word inter-being

1185
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:14,000
and i think it's a wonderful word you

1186
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:17,039
know the idea is like how do we see

1187
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:19,599
the clouds in our textbooks

1188
00:36:17,039 --> 00:36:20,079
you know how do we see it all connected

1189
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:22,720
together

1190
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:23,200
if there's anything that science has

1191
00:36:22,719 --> 00:36:25,439
shown

1192
00:36:23,199 --> 00:36:28,399
in the last 150 years it's that

1193
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:30,240
everything is connected

1194
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:32,320
you know and it's funny i was at a

1195
00:36:30,239 --> 00:36:33,919
conference uh a couple of years ago

1196
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:35,359
asia it's the association for the

1197
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:36,000
advancement of sustainability and higher

1198
00:36:35,358 --> 00:36:38,239
education

1199
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,679
and i was at a workshop that was sort of

1200
00:36:38,239 --> 00:36:42,719
an advanced level workshop

1201
00:36:39,679 --> 00:36:44,319
and it was called competencies

1202
00:36:42,719 --> 00:36:46,319
core competencies in sustainable

1203
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:47,519
education so this was people who've been

1204
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:48,960
involved in the field for a long time

1205
00:36:47,519 --> 00:36:50,480
getting together saying okay

1206
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:51,760
let's teach about sustainability what

1207
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:53,199
are the core things we want students to

1208
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:55,119
come away with what do we want them to

1209
00:36:53,199 --> 00:36:56,960
know and we got into

1210
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:58,400
into tables and we started talking and i

1211
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:00,159
was the first one to

1212
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:01,838
to say something at my table and i said

1213
00:37:00,159 --> 00:37:04,399
look this is good

1214
00:37:01,838 --> 00:37:04,960
i think we should do this but before we

1215
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:08,240
do it i

1216
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:11,599
just want us to recognize that

1217
00:37:08,239 --> 00:37:13,039
we're jumping into the what and i think

1218
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:16,559
we should take a step back

1219
00:37:13,039 --> 00:37:16,880
and reflect on the why because if we

1220
00:37:16,559 --> 00:37:19,199
talk

1221
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:20,960
just about competencies and what we want

1222
00:37:19,199 --> 00:37:23,759
students to know how to do

1223
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:24,639
we're missing a huge thing which is

1224
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:27,359
really about

1225
00:37:24,639 --> 00:37:28,239
the why there's a there's a woman joanna

1226
00:37:27,358 --> 00:37:30,159
macy

1227
00:37:28,239 --> 00:37:31,519
anyone hear of her she was a nuclear

1228
00:37:30,159 --> 00:37:32,960
activist systems thinker

1229
00:37:31,519 --> 00:37:34,800
buddhist scholar also anything she's

1230
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:37,358
written is worth reading

1231
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:39,280
she talks about this great turning

1232
00:37:37,358 --> 00:37:41,358
toward an ecological age that we're

1233
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:43,280
in hopefully now and she says there's

1234
00:37:41,358 --> 00:37:44,880
three things driving this turn

1235
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:47,839
the first of what she calls holding

1236
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:50,000
actions this is slowing the bad

1237
00:37:47,838 --> 00:37:51,599
right this juggernaut of destruction

1238
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,159
that we've become as a species how do we

1239
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:53,680
stop

1240
00:37:52,159 --> 00:37:55,519
all that stuff from rainforest

1241
00:37:53,679 --> 00:37:58,799
destruction and um

1242
00:37:55,519 --> 00:38:00,719
you know the keystone xl all this stuff

1243
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:02,160
how do we slow and stop the stuff that's

1244
00:38:00,719 --> 00:38:04,000
really hurting the planet

1245
00:38:02,159 --> 00:38:05,598
but something she said that was really

1246
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:08,320
powerful to me she says it's not

1247
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:09,599
enough and at that time i think i was

1248
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:10,160
reading her when i was a student and i

1249
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:11,838
was

1250
00:38:10,159 --> 00:38:13,598
part of some of the activism here i was

1251
00:38:11,838 --> 00:38:15,039
arrested in day hall we were doing

1252
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:16,720
shanty towns we were trying to get

1253
00:38:15,039 --> 00:38:18,480
cornell to divest and it was very much

1254
00:38:16,719 --> 00:38:19,679
you know that kind of burnout kind of

1255
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,079
we're just going to make the change

1256
00:38:19,679 --> 00:38:22,239
happen

1257
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:23,280
we got to stop all this and when i read

1258
00:38:22,239 --> 00:38:26,479
that it was like

1259
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:28,000
wow yeah we need to do more and

1260
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:29,679
the two other things she says we need to

1261
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,519
create new we need to create new

1262
00:38:29,679 --> 00:38:33,039
institutions across the map we need to

1263
00:38:31,519 --> 00:38:34,320
create new economic institutions new

1264
00:38:33,039 --> 00:38:35,838
educational institutions

1265
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:38,640
new forms of community new ways of

1266
00:38:35,838 --> 00:38:40,639
learning all of this we need to recreate

1267
00:38:38,639 --> 00:38:42,480
for a post-oil post-carrying capacity

1268
00:38:40,639 --> 00:38:44,559
world because if we don't create the new

1269
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:46,719
we're just going to go back to the bad

1270
00:38:44,559 --> 00:38:48,880
but the really powerful thing she said

1271
00:38:46,719 --> 00:38:50,078
is even that's not enough

1272
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:52,000
she said there's one more thing that

1273
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:53,200
really drives it all and that's really

1274
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:56,960
world views

1275
00:38:53,199 --> 00:38:59,199
stories how do we think about who we are

1276
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:01,199
and so for me it really comes down to

1277
00:38:59,199 --> 00:39:02,480
this idea of inter-being

1278
00:39:01,199 --> 00:39:04,000
and i actually think it's something we

1279
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:05,679
can all get behind and what i was

1280
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,119
astonished at is getting back to that

1281
00:39:05,679 --> 00:39:08,559
table that roundtable where we were

1282
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:10,720
talking about core competencies

1283
00:39:08,559 --> 00:39:11,759
is i shared this i said really for me

1284
00:39:10,719 --> 00:39:13,919
the why

1285
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:15,440
is we're all interconnecting we have to

1286
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:16,880
come from that place and the guy across

1287
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:18,079
the table for me looked at me said yeah

1288
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:20,880
you know that's all good

1289
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:22,560
but really that's your value you know

1290
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:25,200
and i don't think we should be teaching

1291
00:39:22,559 --> 00:39:26,960
our personal values in education and i

1292
00:39:25,199 --> 00:39:29,519
was like

1293
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:30,159
you know i mean these were like the

1294
00:39:29,519 --> 00:39:32,000
elite

1295
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:33,358
of people working in sustainability in

1296
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,358
higher education

1297
00:39:33,358 --> 00:39:36,559
and he thought interdependence was just

1298
00:39:35,358 --> 00:39:38,319
a value

1299
00:39:36,559 --> 00:39:40,239
and i was like whoa we really are in

1300
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:40,880
kindergarten there's a long way to go

1301
00:39:40,239 --> 00:39:42,479
but so

1302
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:44,559
i get flack for talking about

1303
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:45,119
spirituality but i really think it's

1304
00:39:44,559 --> 00:39:46,719
core

1305
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:49,200
because i think this is how we need to

1306
00:39:46,719 --> 00:39:51,519
reorient what we teach

1307
00:39:49,199 --> 00:39:53,439
and really look at how are we connected

1308
00:39:51,519 --> 00:39:56,880
to everything around us

1309
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:58,320
okay almost there academia large

1310
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:59,599
footprint i barely need to say this

1311
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:01,280
right i mean you just walk around

1312
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:04,318
cornell and it's like whoa

1313
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:05,839
and you know elite colleges universities

1314
00:40:04,318 --> 00:40:07,440
they've got to have their expansive

1315
00:40:05,838 --> 00:40:09,199
lawns and their cutting edge

1316
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:11,039
uh science facilities and all that and

1317
00:40:09,199 --> 00:40:11,919
that's all fine but we also need to

1318
00:40:11,039 --> 00:40:13,679
recognize

1319
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:15,280
what it actually does to the environment

1320
00:40:13,679 --> 00:40:17,118
and cornell's doing some great stuff

1321
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:19,119
around sustainability and

1322
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:21,838
i had dinner with my friend dan roth the

1323
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:25,119
other day he's doing great work here

1324
00:40:21,838 --> 00:40:27,199
but really ecovillages start from this

1325
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:29,440
they say how can we live a light

1326
00:40:27,199 --> 00:40:31,439
footprint from the beginning this is

1327
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:33,920
i showed you the nature sanctuary at

1328
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:33,920
finhorn

1329
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:39,920
last but far from least academia i

1330
00:40:37,199 --> 00:40:40,399
tend to find is fairly problem oriented

1331
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:42,400
and

1332
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:44,240
i think it's changing but i know that

1333
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:46,480
even just maybe 10 years ago

1334
00:40:44,239 --> 00:40:48,000
there were lots of environmental studies

1335
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:48,960
and science courses that were basically

1336
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,119
litanies of

1337
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:52,720
the problems in the world and i can't

1338
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:53,838
tell you how many students have come to

1339
00:40:52,719 --> 00:40:57,199
us

1340
00:40:53,838 --> 00:40:58,000
kind of overwhelmed in grief sometimes

1341
00:40:57,199 --> 00:41:01,199
they're almost

1342
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:03,280
numb because they're like i get it

1343
00:41:01,199 --> 00:41:06,639
you know i've read the books i've seen

1344
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:08,160
the movies i understand what's going on

1345
00:41:06,639 --> 00:41:10,078
and and no one's talking about what

1346
00:41:08,159 --> 00:41:13,358
we're going to do about it

1347
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:15,039
and and and for many students the only

1348
00:41:13,358 --> 00:41:18,159
way they can deal with that

1349
00:41:15,039 --> 00:41:21,759
is to shut down because it's too big

1350
00:41:18,159 --> 00:41:24,000
it's like wow you know so

1351
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:25,359
to be able to see communities that are

1352
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:29,358
actually

1353
00:41:25,358 --> 00:41:31,358
working towards solutions working toward

1354
00:41:29,358 --> 00:41:33,759
a place that we can actually live well

1355
00:41:31,358 --> 00:41:36,799
and and happy together

1356
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:38,560
is just such a breath of fresh air i

1357
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:39,599
mean it was for me and i i think it is

1358
00:41:38,559 --> 00:41:43,199
for students as well

1359
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:45,599
so and i i honestly don't think

1360
00:41:43,199 --> 00:41:47,598
the world is going to shift towards

1361
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:49,119
sustainability out of fear i mean

1362
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:52,720
we all know what's going on there's a

1363
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:54,240
lot of scary stuff in the world now

1364
00:41:52,719 --> 00:41:56,399
and i actually i honestly think we're

1365
00:41:54,239 --> 00:41:59,679
sort of approaching a fork

1366
00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:02,400
as a species on one path

1367
00:41:59,679 --> 00:42:04,239
there's the bunker mentality right this

1368
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:07,280
is the predominant story

1369
00:42:04,239 --> 00:42:09,838
of our culture of certainly nations

1370
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:11,440
that we're gonna protect our own we're

1371
00:42:09,838 --> 00:42:13,679
gonna get our bomb shelter we're gonna

1372
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:16,159
put food there i'm gonna get my guns

1373
00:42:13,679 --> 00:42:17,519
and i'm going to you know have my

1374
00:42:16,159 --> 00:42:18,000
boundaries if you come and you try to

1375
00:42:17,519 --> 00:42:20,719
get what

1376
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:22,559
what's mine i'm going to get you right i

1377
00:42:20,719 --> 00:42:22,959
really think that if we go down that

1378
00:42:22,559 --> 00:42:26,559
path

1379
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:28,318
we will go extinct as a species

1380
00:42:26,559 --> 00:42:30,078
but i think there's another path and

1381
00:42:28,318 --> 00:42:32,639
that's the path of community without the

1382
00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:35,680
compassion of generosity

1383
00:42:32,639 --> 00:42:36,159
you know and i think if we go down that

1384
00:42:35,679 --> 00:42:38,078
path

1385
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:39,279
that's where i think this could be the

1386
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:42,318
most exciting time

1387
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:45,119
for humanity i really do that

1388
00:42:42,318 --> 00:42:45,358
these aren't perfect solutions these are

1389
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:50,400
the

1390
00:42:45,358 --> 00:42:50,400
we're in process and i i think that

1391
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:55,440
ecovillages and sustainable communities

1392
00:42:52,719 --> 00:42:58,399
are just trying to push that envelope

1393
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:59,920
and for me being a part of that has been

1394
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:00,240
incredibly fulfilling and i find that

1395
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:03,680
for

1396
00:43:00,239 --> 00:43:06,479
for students as well okay

1397
00:43:03,679 --> 00:43:07,679
that's that's basically it um we've got

1398
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:09,679
some time i think yeah

1399
00:43:07,679 --> 00:43:11,039
so let's let's talk i mean you can take

1400
00:43:09,679 --> 00:43:12,318
this information down i've got

1401
00:43:11,039 --> 00:43:14,000
things actually if you want to be on our

1402
00:43:12,318 --> 00:43:14,559
mailing list i can put this around it's

1403
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,599
kind of

1404
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:19,519
anti-climactic but

1405
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:21,680
we send out newsletters and stuff but

1406
00:43:19,519 --> 00:43:24,838
really let me let me actually go back

1407
00:43:21,679 --> 00:43:26,000
here and let me actually also i'll get

1408
00:43:24,838 --> 00:43:29,519
some

1409
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:31,039
for sure so yeah i mean we can ask some

1410
00:43:29,519 --> 00:43:33,838
specific questions do you guys have

1411
00:43:31,039 --> 00:43:35,519
questions about the talk but um yeah

1412
00:43:33,838 --> 00:43:38,838
we'd like to do a

1413
00:43:35,519 --> 00:43:42,400
sort of discussion

1414
00:43:38,838 --> 00:43:43,759
um you know if you're shy

1415
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:45,599
raise your hand and you can get your

1416
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:48,720
name if you're trying to speak out

1417
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:49,280
yeah you know um for everybody so i

1418
00:43:48,719 --> 00:43:52,000
guess

1419
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:52,839
are there any questions now first of all

1420
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,199
anna

1421
00:43:52,838 --> 00:43:56,159
um that's amazing you're very good right

1422
00:43:55,199 --> 00:43:59,199
now

1423
00:43:56,159 --> 00:44:01,118
um well i was

1424
00:43:59,199 --> 00:44:02,480
i was living in an intentional community

1425
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:05,599
in west virginia

1426
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:09,838
and definitely um

1427
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:09,838
where was it was

1428
00:44:20,719 --> 00:44:24,239
and i definitely felt while i was there

1429
00:44:23,039 --> 00:44:27,599
was maintaining

1430
00:44:24,239 --> 00:44:29,759
a population through generations yeah

1431
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:31,680
um so they had started in the 70s and it

1432
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:34,960
was really strong for 20 years

1433
00:44:31,679 --> 00:44:36,159
and then people are 18 and they go to

1434
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:39,119
college and

1435
00:44:36,159 --> 00:44:41,118
not a lot of people came back um and so

1436
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:43,838
it seems like for the past

1437
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:45,519
it's i guess it's 40 or 50 years now

1438
00:44:43,838 --> 00:44:46,480
it's been going on for the past 20 it's

1439
00:44:45,519 --> 00:44:49,679
a lot of adults

1440
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:50,559
yeah and that just doesn't seem like you

1441
00:44:49,679 --> 00:44:52,559
can have a

1442
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:54,559
sustainable community without all

1443
00:44:52,559 --> 00:44:56,960
generations

1444
00:44:54,559 --> 00:44:58,480
so i'm curious if you've seen any

1445
00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:01,280
villages that

1446
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:02,719
have found a solution to that or are

1447
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:04,000
also struggling

1448
00:45:02,719 --> 00:45:06,799
i mean at least they were having babies

1449
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:09,119
right i mean the shakers

1450
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:10,400
you gotta start there uh and it is an

1451
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:13,200
issue in a lot of

1452
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:14,559
a lot of communities um and it's natural

1453
00:45:13,199 --> 00:45:17,118
in a way because you think i mean

1454
00:45:14,559 --> 00:45:19,119
these communities are really radical and

1455
00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:22,318
it takes a lot of

1456
00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:23,760
ideological fervor among the founders

1457
00:45:22,318 --> 00:45:25,519
to do something that radical and we

1458
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:27,440
can't expect our kids

1459
00:45:25,519 --> 00:45:28,559
to do that and actually it's often the

1460
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:29,838
opposite because kids

1461
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:31,679
often want to do the opposite of what

1462
00:45:29,838 --> 00:45:32,000
their parents are doing i often think oh

1463
00:45:31,679 --> 00:45:33,598
well

1464
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,440
living roots my dream is to have this be

1465
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:36,960
sort of a communiversity

1466
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:37,838
by the time my kids are in college and

1467
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:39,838
of course they're going to want to be

1468
00:45:37,838 --> 00:45:43,358
stock brokers or something like that

1469
00:45:39,838 --> 00:45:45,119
um so it is an issue

1470
00:45:43,358 --> 00:45:46,000
and there's a couple ways that i found

1471
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:47,599
that communities that have been

1472
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,318
successful that have dealt with it one

1473
00:45:47,599 --> 00:45:50,880
is

1474
00:45:48,318 --> 00:45:51,838
they've created layers of the onion so

1475
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:55,280
example

1476
00:45:51,838 --> 00:45:55,838
sirius where i live my wife and i were

1477
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:58,000
members

1478
00:45:55,838 --> 00:46:00,480
for a year and then what happened we had

1479
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:02,318
kids and i started living roots

1480
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:04,000
and to be a member at serious you have

1481
00:46:02,318 --> 00:46:04,800
to give eight hours a week of community

1482
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,159
service

1483
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:07,760
and go to the thursday night meetings

1484
00:46:06,159 --> 00:46:09,118
and it got to be a point where my wife

1485
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:10,480
monique was saying you ain't going to

1486
00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:12,160
those meetings anymore

1487
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:14,400
you know you're here at home with the

1488
00:46:12,159 --> 00:46:15,679
kid and we just didn't have the time

1489
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:17,119
and that's a challenge in a lot of

1490
00:46:15,679 --> 00:46:17,838
communities that it's difficult for

1491
00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:19,838
families

1492
00:46:17,838 --> 00:46:21,358
and professionals to really be there but

1493
00:46:19,838 --> 00:46:22,239
what we did was we moved across the

1494
00:46:21,358 --> 00:46:23,598
street

1495
00:46:22,239 --> 00:46:26,318
and a lot of other people did the same

1496
00:46:23,599 --> 00:46:28,000
thing and so we live in this incredibly

1497
00:46:26,318 --> 00:46:30,639
community-minded neighborhood

1498
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:31,519
and we i created these a little time

1499
00:46:30,639 --> 00:46:33,920
share for

1500
00:46:31,519 --> 00:46:35,519
for child care and we just you know we

1501
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:37,358
just share a lot of resources

1502
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:38,960
so that's one way that it happens is

1503
00:46:37,358 --> 00:46:40,838
that people just move one step outside

1504
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:44,559
of the community but they still stay

1505
00:46:40,838 --> 00:46:47,358
engaged another way is that they get big

1506
00:46:44,559 --> 00:46:48,318
so finnhorn and oroville are big enough

1507
00:46:47,358 --> 00:46:50,719
where

1508
00:46:48,318 --> 00:46:52,318
the youth feel like they can kind of

1509
00:46:50,719 --> 00:46:55,039
rebel

1510
00:46:52,318 --> 00:46:56,880
but still stay part of the community so

1511
00:46:55,039 --> 00:46:59,920
and orville there's still enough

1512
00:46:56,880 --> 00:47:01,760
growing edges that young people can say

1513
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:03,119
i'm going to make my mark over here and

1514
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:05,520
i'm not going to have to feel like i'm

1515
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:07,680
just carrying on what my parents did

1516
00:47:05,519 --> 00:47:09,119
right that's one of the the challenges

1517
00:47:07,679 --> 00:47:09,759
finnhorn what's happening is a lot of

1518
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:12,400
the youth

1519
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:14,000
go away and then they come back and

1520
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:17,680
that's been been happening a lot

1521
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:18,239
too and you know a lot of communities

1522
00:47:17,679 --> 00:47:21,039
just

1523
00:47:18,239 --> 00:47:22,799
exist on people coming and going and

1524
00:47:21,039 --> 00:47:24,159
they recognize that there's gonna be

1525
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:25,680
a core group of people that are there

1526
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:26,318
for a long time and then there are

1527
00:47:25,679 --> 00:47:29,199
people who

1528
00:47:26,318 --> 00:47:29,199
kind of come and go

1529
00:47:29,679 --> 00:47:38,000
yeah it's a big issue you can read my

1530
00:47:31,679 --> 00:47:39,358
thesis on children and community

1531
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,280
thoughts and i happen to carry on to

1532
00:47:39,358 --> 00:47:42,639
that that's it

1533
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:44,000
can i can i say something more about

1534
00:47:42,639 --> 00:47:45,440
kids and communities since you kind of

1535
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,079
brought it up and it is that's a passion

1536
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:48,559
of mine

1537
00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:49,280
um if i could go back and if i could do

1538
00:47:48,559 --> 00:47:50,559
my thesis

1539
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:52,160
again i mean it was a wonderful thing

1540
00:47:50,559 --> 00:47:53,599
but i really bit off way more than i

1541
00:47:52,159 --> 00:47:55,039
could chew i was basically looking at

1542
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:55,680
children in education and community i

1543
00:47:55,039 --> 00:47:57,119
mean it was

1544
00:47:55,679 --> 00:47:59,279
there was nothing that escaped my

1545
00:47:57,119 --> 00:48:01,680
attention um

1546
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:03,200
something i found fascinating that i

1547
00:48:01,679 --> 00:48:05,759
think deserves a lot more

1548
00:48:03,199 --> 00:48:07,039
research is for our thank you the

1549
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:09,119
relationships

1550
00:48:07,039 --> 00:48:10,480
that children are able to form in

1551
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:13,039
community

1552
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:14,400
with adults that aren't their parents

1553
00:48:13,039 --> 00:48:15,599
that aren't their teachers aren't their

1554
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:16,720
friends parents or their friends parents

1555
00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:18,160
but are just friends

1556
00:48:16,719 --> 00:48:20,159
you know and i don't know how many of

1557
00:48:18,159 --> 00:48:21,838
you had that growing up i didn't

1558
00:48:20,159 --> 00:48:24,239
there was no adult in my life that was

1559
00:48:21,838 --> 00:48:27,440
just a friend

1560
00:48:24,239 --> 00:48:29,199
in community it's the norm and

1561
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:31,280
i think that's such a powerful thing and

1562
00:48:29,199 --> 00:48:32,239
i think it's something so sad that we've

1563
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:35,680
gotten away from that

1564
00:48:32,239 --> 00:48:37,358
in our society and i'm so grateful that

1565
00:48:35,679 --> 00:48:38,799
my kids have been able to grow up in a

1566
00:48:37,358 --> 00:48:39,358
place where they can walk to their

1567
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:41,599
friends

1568
00:48:39,358 --> 00:48:43,279
houses and they just know that their

1569
00:48:41,599 --> 00:48:44,720
friends houses are their houses and and

1570
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:45,839
it's all just and they just know the

1571
00:48:44,719 --> 00:48:47,439
area and

1572
00:48:45,838 --> 00:48:49,838
they feel like they're part of this

1573
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:52,559
tribe and

1574
00:48:49,838 --> 00:48:53,358
if it's our goal which i hope it is to

1575
00:48:52,559 --> 00:48:55,119
help develop

1576
00:48:53,358 --> 00:48:56,880
global citizens people with a sense of

1577
00:48:55,119 --> 00:48:59,680
belonging to the whole planet

1578
00:48:56,880 --> 00:49:00,160
i can't think of a better foundation for

1579
00:48:59,679 --> 00:49:01,919
that

1580
00:49:00,159 --> 00:49:04,318
than to grow up in a community where you

1581
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:05,280
have strong relationships with people

1582
00:49:04,318 --> 00:49:08,880
beyond your

1583
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:11,200
your own family and yeah i mean i

1584
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:13,119
i was in child care and it was weird you

1585
00:49:11,199 --> 00:49:16,480
know this was again the 80s i was

1586
00:49:13,119 --> 00:49:19,519
working in preschools and as a man

1587
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:20,880
i would get one of two types of feedback

1588
00:49:19,519 --> 00:49:24,800
one was

1589
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:26,160
oh you know it's so great you're a guy

1590
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:28,000
you know when my kids get to hang out

1591
00:49:26,159 --> 00:49:28,799
with a guy you know and the other one

1592
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,880
was like

1593
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:33,119
you know why are you here what are you

1594
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:34,160
doing and like you know neither of those

1595
00:49:33,119 --> 00:49:35,838
were seeing me

1596
00:49:34,159 --> 00:49:37,279
if you know i could be a good child care

1597
00:49:35,838 --> 00:49:39,039
provider or a bad child care provider

1598
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:41,040
but they didn't they didn't see that

1599
00:49:39,039 --> 00:49:42,480
so and i think part of that is just

1600
00:49:41,039 --> 00:49:44,880
because we don't live in a culture where

1601
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:48,159
this is normal

1602
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:50,240
so i i i think kids in communities

1603
00:49:48,159 --> 00:49:51,759
is key i don't know maybe there weren't

1604
00:49:50,239 --> 00:49:56,078
that many kids in the community

1605
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:58,000
no i was the youngest person so

1606
00:49:56,079 --> 00:50:00,880
for sure i think most of the kids have

1607
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:03,440
lost about five years before

1608
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:04,960
yeah they're really struggling with that

1609
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:06,318
one one last thing on that is it was

1610
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:09,280
interesting that when we started running

1611
00:50:06,318 --> 00:50:09,279
programs at findhorn

1612
00:50:09,519 --> 00:50:13,440
they were nervous at first because at

1613
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:16,000
finhorn if you look at the

1614
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:17,679
the demographics there was this dip from

1615
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:19,760
18 to 25 because

1616
00:50:17,679 --> 00:50:20,719
they're all gone they all go to college

1617
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:22,000
and when we and we

1618
00:50:20,719 --> 00:50:23,039
said we're going to bring some college

1619
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:25,119
students they were like ah they're going

1620
00:50:23,039 --> 00:50:28,000
to make a mess you know because they did

1621
00:50:25,119 --> 00:50:28,720
um but they also found there was this

1622
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,639
like

1623
00:50:28,719 --> 00:50:32,239
filling up they're like oh this feels

1624
00:50:30,639 --> 00:50:35,920
good because it actually

1625
00:50:32,239 --> 00:50:39,358
we need that kind of energy here so yeah

1626
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:43,280
thanks yeah i don't know your name um so

1627
00:50:39,358 --> 00:50:45,920
anzac exactly just the

1628
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:46,559
curiosity do you think that population

1629
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:49,599
density

1630
00:50:46,559 --> 00:50:51,519
has an impact on community say morning

1631
00:50:49,599 --> 00:50:53,519
i'm sorry say more i'm curious where

1632
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:55,039
you're going all right so i kind of did

1633
00:50:53,519 --> 00:50:58,719
grow up in the

1634
00:50:55,039 --> 00:51:01,838
rural farming community um did the 4-h

1635
00:50:58,719 --> 00:51:04,000
program um you know new neighbors

1636
00:51:01,838 --> 00:51:05,599
i guess if you could kind of compare it

1637
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:09,199
i grew up

1638
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:11,519
almost in the 60s without the drugs

1639
00:51:09,199 --> 00:51:12,480
and i was just wondering if you felt

1640
00:51:11,519 --> 00:51:16,318
that that could be an

1641
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:18,159
uh factor is population density as a

1642
00:51:16,318 --> 00:51:20,318
like a town becomes a city does it

1643
00:51:18,159 --> 00:51:21,920
become less of a community

1644
00:51:20,318 --> 00:51:23,759
that's that's an interesting question

1645
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:26,880
and one of the things that

1646
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:27,760
i look for in the communities we take

1647
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:30,480
students to

1648
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:32,160
is that it has to be grockable you know

1649
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:33,599
it has to be of a size where you

1650
00:51:32,159 --> 00:51:35,358
feel like you can get to know most

1651
00:51:33,599 --> 00:51:36,960
people in that community and maybe more

1652
00:51:35,358 --> 00:51:39,519
importantly you can become known

1653
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:40,240
in that community there's no set number

1654
00:51:39,519 --> 00:51:42,159
on that

1655
00:51:40,239 --> 00:51:43,439
some say it's a hundred some say it can

1656
00:51:42,159 --> 00:51:47,598
go up to a thousand

1657
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:49,679
um maybe over time but i do think that

1658
00:51:47,599 --> 00:51:50,800
there is a natural resonance that we

1659
00:51:49,679 --> 00:51:53,838
have

1660
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:55,760
in groups that are knowable and

1661
00:51:53,838 --> 00:51:57,199
and so we've often thought oh it'd be

1662
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:59,520
great to do a

1663
00:51:57,199 --> 00:52:00,960
semester program in an urban area and

1664
00:51:59,519 --> 00:52:03,679
there's a lot of great things happening

1665
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:04,000
but i haven't found the way to do it

1666
00:52:03,679 --> 00:52:06,639
that

1667
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:07,838
has that magic component of waking

1668
00:52:06,639 --> 00:52:09,039
students up to that sense of community

1669
00:52:07,838 --> 00:52:11,279
what you're saying is

1670
00:52:09,039 --> 00:52:14,159
a magic number hasn't really or a magic

1671
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:14,160
stocking density

1672
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:19,119
the magic population isn't really known

1673
00:52:18,639 --> 00:52:21,679
it's just

1674
00:52:19,119 --> 00:52:23,119
it's more of a quality of community

1675
00:52:21,679 --> 00:52:25,519
rather than a

1676
00:52:23,119 --> 00:52:27,280
density yeah i mean what happens often

1677
00:52:25,519 --> 00:52:29,280
like orville which i said is this large

1678
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:32,079
community about 2200

1679
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:33,200
they have naturally just broken into

1680
00:52:32,079 --> 00:52:34,480
smaller communities

1681
00:52:33,199 --> 00:52:36,399
so in some ways they're best thought of

1682
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:38,240
as like a township and so there's maybe

1683
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:41,358
a hundred communities that range from

1684
00:52:38,239 --> 00:52:42,719
five people to 100 people or so and so

1685
00:52:41,358 --> 00:52:44,078
but they're all part of this other

1686
00:52:42,719 --> 00:52:44,879
community so i think that's where we

1687
00:52:44,079 --> 00:52:46,318
need to go

1688
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:48,400
is thinking about those layers of the

1689
00:52:46,318 --> 00:52:50,800
onion you know who is my

1690
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:52,480
intimate group that i'm really working

1691
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:53,839
with and living with day to day

1692
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:55,838
and then who's that other group that i'm

1693
00:52:53,838 --> 00:52:58,078
making decisions with that maybe i'm

1694
00:52:55,838 --> 00:52:59,679
part of some collectives with conscious

1695
00:52:58,079 --> 00:53:01,920
collaborative consumption

1696
00:52:59,679 --> 00:53:03,519
whether it's csas trading things like

1697
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:04,480
that and then how are we part of

1698
00:53:03,519 --> 00:53:06,159
something larger

1699
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:08,079
but that we actually feel a sense of

1700
00:53:06,159 --> 00:53:11,679
agency in that too i think that could go

1701
00:53:08,079 --> 00:53:11,680
up and even into cities

1702
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:18,400
yes sure i have a very unrelated sort of

1703
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:19,679
logistical question sure how do people

1704
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:22,200
in eco villages

1705
00:53:19,679 --> 00:53:25,199
um handle getting medical care or

1706
00:53:22,199 --> 00:53:25,199
healthcare

1707
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:30,559
um um i mean i you know i wear glasses

1708
00:53:30,318 --> 00:53:32,159
and

1709
00:53:30,559 --> 00:53:33,680
yeah i like to go to the dentist yeah

1710
00:53:32,159 --> 00:53:34,480
you know people that would have you know

1711
00:53:33,679 --> 00:53:36,879
disabilities

1712
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:37,838
sure or uh or you know diseases and

1713
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:39,440
ailments and such

1714
00:53:37,838 --> 00:53:41,039
how do they get access to them i mean

1715
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:43,119
these are rational people so and they're

1716
00:53:41,039 --> 00:53:44,639
pragmatic so i mean we're not expecting

1717
00:53:43,119 --> 00:53:48,079
every eco village to have

1718
00:53:44,639 --> 00:53:50,799
a hospital an airport uh you know

1719
00:53:48,079 --> 00:53:51,200
and so there are often health facilities

1720
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:52,880
in

1721
00:53:51,199 --> 00:53:54,078
the at least the larger communities and

1722
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:55,119
even the smaller ones you kind of know

1723
00:53:54,079 --> 00:53:56,720
who to go to

1724
00:53:55,119 --> 00:53:59,358
i mean my wife is a midwife and so

1725
00:53:56,719 --> 00:54:01,519
people know things around that or

1726
00:53:59,358 --> 00:54:03,039
um you know homeopathic and things like

1727
00:54:01,519 --> 00:54:04,880
that so there's a lot of just

1728
00:54:03,039 --> 00:54:06,719
local wisdom and knowledge but things

1729
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:07,680
like that yeah they go to the doctor

1730
00:54:06,719 --> 00:54:12,719
they go to

1731
00:54:07,679 --> 00:54:12,719
wherever they need to go take care

1732
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:15,920
and that's the world we live in you know

1733
00:54:14,559 --> 00:54:17,359
and actually you remember i said that

1734
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:18,720
study that was done at finhorn that

1735
00:54:17,358 --> 00:54:19,440
showed that it had half the ecological

1736
00:54:18,719 --> 00:54:21,679
footprint

1737
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:22,800
it was only that high because of their

1738
00:54:21,679 --> 00:54:24,078
travel

1739
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:25,519
because there's a lot of people at

1740
00:54:24,079 --> 00:54:26,720
finnhorn who are fairly known in the

1741
00:54:25,519 --> 00:54:28,000
world and they go out and do workshops

1742
00:54:26,719 --> 00:54:29,838
and they're flying and they're

1743
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:31,440
driving and taking buses and trains and

1744
00:54:29,838 --> 00:54:33,199
that that's what up their

1745
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:34,720
footprint and that's because we just

1746
00:54:33,199 --> 00:54:36,078
live in a world that there's a fossil

1747
00:54:34,719 --> 00:54:37,199
fuel economy that we can't really get

1748
00:54:36,079 --> 00:54:41,039
away from at this point

1749
00:54:37,199 --> 00:54:42,639
right so yeah you do what you need to do

1750
00:54:41,039 --> 00:54:44,400
um also unrelated i really liked your

1751
00:54:42,639 --> 00:54:47,598
comment about recognizing that you

1752
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:50,079
enjoyed kids more than computers

1753
00:54:47,599 --> 00:54:52,798
i realized quite a while ago that i

1754
00:54:50,079 --> 00:54:56,000
prefer trees over people

1755
00:54:52,798 --> 00:54:57,039
but i also realize that uh you can't get

1756
00:54:56,000 --> 00:55:00,719
rid of people

1757
00:54:57,039 --> 00:55:03,119
right so i'm balancing my own

1758
00:55:00,719 --> 00:55:04,639
my own perspective on life and what's

1759
00:55:03,119 --> 00:55:08,000
right for me as a person

1760
00:55:04,639 --> 00:55:10,159
and my ideologies and etc and

1761
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:11,920
realizing that what i would like to

1762
00:55:10,159 --> 00:55:14,000
start focusing on is the short list of

1763
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:16,798
things that i don't agree with

1764
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:18,798
and learning how to how to somewhat

1765
00:55:16,798 --> 00:55:20,639
capitalize off of them how do i take

1766
00:55:18,798 --> 00:55:22,719
that negative energy of hey i don't

1767
00:55:20,639 --> 00:55:24,558
really like people but i like trees

1768
00:55:22,719 --> 00:55:26,879
well why not teach young people about

1769
00:55:24,559 --> 00:55:30,240
trees you know just sort of taking

1770
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:33,358
a different stance on it um

1771
00:55:30,239 --> 00:55:34,479
so that's sort of where uh i really like

1772
00:55:33,358 --> 00:55:35,440
the comment that you made because

1773
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:37,440
sometimes it's just

1774
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:38,880
recognizing the simplicities of putting

1775
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:40,559
things in a categories and i think that

1776
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:44,000
this alone

1777
00:55:40,559 --> 00:55:46,000
uh everything on on the right side

1778
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:48,239
speaks to me and always has

1779
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:49,358
and i think also you said something

1780
00:55:48,239 --> 00:55:52,078
about

1781
00:55:49,358 --> 00:55:52,960
um feeling that void that you feel like

1782
00:55:52,079 --> 00:55:54,960
you've had

1783
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:56,960
and i think at the point that i came to

1784
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:57,760
cornell i started to recognize that much

1785
00:55:56,960 --> 00:56:01,119
more

1786
00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:05,040
how i would be an advocate of academia

1787
00:56:01,119 --> 00:56:07,440
and yet since i'm so unconventional

1788
00:56:05,039 --> 00:56:08,400
i feel uncomfortable in that type of

1789
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:13,280
setting

1790
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:13,280
and yet that the correlation of

1791
00:56:13,519 --> 00:56:17,519
different disciplinaries and

1792
00:56:16,079 --> 00:56:19,359
collaborative work

1793
00:56:17,519 --> 00:56:20,639
that's where the rubber meets the road

1794
00:56:19,358 --> 00:56:22,558
you're right that in the real world

1795
00:56:20,639 --> 00:56:25,199
that's what it takes to make

1796
00:56:22,559 --> 00:56:26,240
things happen is multiple people around

1797
00:56:25,199 --> 00:56:28,399
a large table

1798
00:56:26,239 --> 00:56:30,318
all coming from a different perspective

1799
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:32,318
and then being able to come together and

1800
00:56:30,318 --> 00:56:34,480
devise those solutions

1801
00:56:32,318 --> 00:56:36,318
so that's you know in the in short what

1802
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:38,318
academia taught me but i think i learned

1803
00:56:36,318 --> 00:56:40,000
that long before i came here

1804
00:56:38,318 --> 00:56:41,440
and it took coming here for me to

1805
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:43,760
recognize that i knew that

1806
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:46,079
yeah this is what i'm saying yeah i had

1807
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:49,359
to do all that in trees

1808
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:52,318
well it's just an example yes it's just

1809
00:56:49,358 --> 00:56:54,400
um for me it was the recognition of

1810
00:56:52,318 --> 00:56:55,358
where my love of the environment and my

1811
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:58,318
love of art

1812
00:56:55,358 --> 00:56:59,679
met together at um at a specific point

1813
00:56:58,318 --> 00:57:00,318
in my life and that was before i came

1814
00:56:59,679 --> 00:57:02,798
before

1815
00:57:00,318 --> 00:57:04,000
right so i'm building off of that it's

1816
00:57:02,798 --> 00:57:05,679
it's putting things together

1817
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:07,199
it's being creative it's been

1818
00:57:05,679 --> 00:57:10,639
spontaneous

1819
00:57:07,199 --> 00:57:12,558
and sometimes compromises too i mean

1820
00:57:10,639 --> 00:57:14,239
you know that what that struck in me was

1821
00:57:12,559 --> 00:57:16,640
that um

1822
00:57:14,239 --> 00:57:18,399
you can imagine a core dilemma of this

1823
00:57:16,639 --> 00:57:19,199
business this or this organization under

1824
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:20,720
roots is that

1825
00:57:19,199 --> 00:57:22,960
here we are an organization all about

1826
00:57:20,719 --> 00:57:24,399
sustainability and yet what are we doing

1827
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:26,079
i mean we're flying people all over the

1828
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:26,960
world there's something really weird

1829
00:57:26,079 --> 00:57:29,359
about that

1830
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:31,119
and i honest i strongly believe that the

1831
00:57:29,358 --> 00:57:33,199
impact that we make on students is

1832
00:57:31,119 --> 00:57:36,480
lifelong and it far exceeds

1833
00:57:33,199 --> 00:57:38,318
um the the impact of the program in fact

1834
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:40,240
a friend actually did a study he does a

1835
00:57:38,318 --> 00:57:42,480
semester program in like an ecological

1836
00:57:40,239 --> 00:57:45,759
semester in costa rica

1837
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:48,880
yeah and he saw he found that

1838
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:49,839
students ecological footprint for that

1839
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:52,640
semester

1840
00:57:49,838 --> 00:57:54,880
was lower in costa rica including the

1841
00:57:52,639 --> 00:57:56,000
impact from their their flights

1842
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:58,318
than what it would have been if they

1843
00:57:56,000 --> 00:58:00,000
just stayed on campus so that's like

1844
00:57:58,318 --> 00:58:01,759
yeah and that's not true of all the

1845
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:03,039
places but going it's a big way to go to

1846
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:04,240
india but once they're there they're

1847
00:58:03,039 --> 00:58:07,199
living really light lifestyles

1848
00:58:04,239 --> 00:58:08,798
but one of the things that we've done is

1849
00:58:07,199 --> 00:58:10,159
we have always been committed to

1850
00:58:08,798 --> 00:58:13,679
measuring and reducing and

1851
00:58:10,159 --> 00:58:15,679
somehow uh measuring reducing and

1852
00:58:13,679 --> 00:58:15,919
somehow mitigating our carbon impacts

1853
00:58:15,679 --> 00:58:17,759
and

1854
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:18,960
planting trees is a big place that we do

1855
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:21,520
that so

1856
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:22,720
um tree planting is a strong component

1857
00:58:21,519 --> 00:58:24,079
in all of their programs and really

1858
00:58:22,719 --> 00:58:25,598
connecting the trees

1859
00:58:24,079 --> 00:58:27,839
there was a cyclone did i mention this

1860
00:58:25,599 --> 00:58:29,200
that went through india recently did any

1861
00:58:27,838 --> 00:58:30,960
of you see this

1862
00:58:29,199 --> 00:58:33,439
it went it was uh just before the new

1863
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:36,000
year and went right through oroville

1864
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:37,358
and cyclone vane and it was like a

1865
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:39,760
hundred year event

1866
00:58:37,358 --> 00:58:40,558
and just ripped up in some areas 40

1867
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:43,440
years

1868
00:58:40,559 --> 00:58:43,760
of reforestation work are just gone and

1869
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:45,119
um

1870
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:46,720
i mean they're a resilient community

1871
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:48,720
they'll come back and they're do and the

1872
00:58:46,719 --> 00:58:50,879
silver lining actually is that

1873
00:58:48,719 --> 00:58:52,399
in the early days folks in oroville

1874
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:53,680
showed up and there was this desert

1875
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:55,440
and they just started planting trees

1876
00:58:53,679 --> 00:58:57,118
what did they plant it's a tree called

1877
00:58:55,440 --> 00:59:00,079
the acacia auriculoforma

1878
00:58:57,119 --> 00:59:01,599
it's a kind of eucalyptus and it was

1879
00:59:00,079 --> 00:59:04,240
really good at digging into this

1880
00:59:01,599 --> 00:59:05,440
really kind of like hard baked soil it

1881
00:59:04,239 --> 00:59:07,199
was like terra cotta

1882
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:08,400
you know and this tree was really good

1883
00:59:07,199 --> 00:59:10,078
at breaking that up and making it

1884
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:14,160
available for other trees to follow

1885
00:59:10,079 --> 00:59:14,160
and then other trees showed up and

1886
00:59:14,318 --> 00:59:18,159
interestingly in this cyclone most of

1887
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:20,000
the trees that came down

1888
00:59:18,159 --> 00:59:22,078
were those what they call the work trees

1889
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:23,760
and so now the tropical dry evergreen

1890
00:59:22,079 --> 00:59:26,079
forest is really there

1891
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:28,079
and so it's kind of cool it's like yeah

1892
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:32,640
it was devastated but what's left

1893
00:59:28,079 --> 00:59:34,160
is what should be there but yeah

1894
00:59:32,639 --> 00:59:36,239
other thoughts questions how are we

1895
00:59:34,159 --> 00:59:38,639
doing four times we got to 4 20.

1896
00:59:36,239 --> 00:59:41,519
um or less 4 15 maybe i think there's

1897
00:59:38,639 --> 00:59:41,519
some people that are coming in

1898
00:59:41,838 --> 00:59:44,159
tomorrow

1899
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:49,760
so this is a great presentation that you

1900
00:59:48,318 --> 00:59:51,119
don't see much anymore

1901
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:52,799
and this also came out of that

1902
00:59:51,119 --> 00:59:53,358
ideological fervor of the founders you

1903
00:59:52,798 --> 00:59:55,440
know they

1904
00:59:53,358 --> 00:59:57,440
they had these big dreams they're saying

1905
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:58,720
wait a minute and this is also true twin

1906
00:59:57,440 --> 00:59:59,920
oaks which you were mentioning too they

1907
00:59:58,719 --> 01:00:00,798
they remodeled themselves after the

1908
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:02,480
kibbutz

1909
01:00:00,798 --> 01:00:03,599
and they said just because you have a

1910
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:04,960
kid doesn't mean you're going to be a

1911
01:00:03,599 --> 01:00:06,400
great parent

1912
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:08,240
so why don't we find the people who are

1913
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:10,079
really good at with kids

1914
01:00:08,239 --> 01:00:11,358
and have them raise the kids right i

1915
01:00:10,079 --> 01:00:12,240
mean there's something theoretical that

1916
01:00:11,358 --> 01:00:14,078
makes sense

1917
01:00:12,239 --> 01:00:16,000
but practically it didn't work you know

1918
01:00:14,079 --> 01:00:17,920
i mean to separate that bond between

1919
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:19,599
children and parents and so it maybe

1920
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:21,920
lasted a generation or two

1921
01:00:19,599 --> 01:00:22,720
but you don't find that anymore but in

1922
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:25,200
terms of that

1923
01:00:22,719 --> 01:00:26,558
question of too much community um you

1924
01:00:25,199 --> 01:00:28,318
know ever

1925
01:00:26,559 --> 01:00:29,760
i mean communities are made up of people

1926
01:00:28,318 --> 01:00:30,960
and there's all different types of

1927
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:32,000
people and i find there's often

1928
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:33,920
continuums

1929
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:35,358
uh in any community one of those

1930
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:37,358
continuums i find

1931
01:00:35,358 --> 01:00:38,400
is that on one end there's the people

1932
01:00:37,358 --> 01:00:40,798
who are saying

1933
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:42,720
look i don't care how long it takes i

1934
01:00:40,798 --> 01:00:44,798
don't care how long we sit here

1935
01:00:42,719 --> 01:00:46,078
we're going to work this through we'll

1936
01:00:44,798 --> 01:00:47,759
be up all night and we're going to come

1937
01:00:46,079 --> 01:00:49,119
out with a decision you know or

1938
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:50,640
and just as long as we all feel good

1939
01:00:49,119 --> 01:00:51,838
about it right and then there's people

1940
01:00:50,639 --> 01:00:53,358
on the other end of the spectrum they're

1941
01:00:51,838 --> 01:00:55,279
saying i don't want another

1942
01:00:53,358 --> 01:00:56,639
damn meeting you know i just want to go

1943
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:59,359
build something all right

1944
01:00:56,639 --> 01:01:00,159
you know and and people exist on those

1945
01:00:59,358 --> 01:01:02,798
ends of the con

1946
01:01:00,159 --> 01:01:03,440
the spectrum and they often butt heads

1947
01:01:02,798 --> 01:01:05,358
right

1948
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:07,039
you know another spectrum i find is that

1949
01:01:05,358 --> 01:01:10,078
there are people who come to a community

1950
01:01:07,039 --> 01:01:11,920
because they like it just the way it is

1951
01:01:10,079 --> 01:01:13,680
i don't want to cut another tree i don't

1952
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:14,240
want another member i think this is

1953
01:01:13,679 --> 01:01:16,078
perfect

1954
01:01:14,239 --> 01:01:17,679
right and then there are people and i

1955
01:01:16,079 --> 01:01:19,359
probably i'm one of them

1956
01:01:17,679 --> 01:01:21,358
you know who come to a community and

1957
01:01:19,358 --> 01:01:23,039
kind of see it for what it can become

1958
01:01:21,358 --> 01:01:24,480
you know it's like oh we can kind of

1959
01:01:23,039 --> 01:01:26,400
clear this area we can create a whole

1960
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:29,199
new nucleus over here or whatever

1961
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:29,838
and we butt heads you know so it's just

1962
01:01:29,199 --> 01:01:31,598
natural

1963
01:01:29,838 --> 01:01:32,880
there's a there's a saying there's a

1964
01:01:31,599 --> 01:01:35,200
japanese saying

1965
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:36,640
that if you want to clean potatoes one

1966
01:01:35,199 --> 01:01:38,960
of the ways you do it is you put them

1967
01:01:36,639 --> 01:01:40,960
all in a pot of water and you shake

1968
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:42,079
and just by rubbing each other they

1969
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:45,199
clean each other

1970
01:01:42,079 --> 01:01:48,400
and people are like that you know and

1971
01:01:45,199 --> 01:01:50,960
i i've been very

1972
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:52,160
grateful to see when sometimes someone

1973
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:54,159
comes into a community

1974
01:01:52,159 --> 01:01:55,759
and they have some sharp edges you know

1975
01:01:54,159 --> 01:01:56,719
they have very strong opinions it's got

1976
01:01:55,760 --> 01:01:59,359
to be this way or

1977
01:01:56,719 --> 01:02:01,038
the highway or you know and over time

1978
01:01:59,358 --> 01:02:03,119
it's wonderful to see them kind of

1979
01:02:01,039 --> 01:02:04,960
soften a little bit and round and kind

1980
01:02:03,119 --> 01:02:06,400
of you know their communication skills

1981
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:09,760
improve and to me

1982
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:12,318
that's a real fundamental value of

1983
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:13,280
living in communities just that rubbing

1984
01:02:12,318 --> 01:02:16,318
and kind of

1985
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:19,440
pissing each other off too is really

1986
01:02:16,318 --> 01:02:21,119
helping us become more resilient and

1987
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:22,960
understand how we can communicate and

1988
01:02:21,119 --> 01:02:23,920
take others needs and values into

1989
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:26,798
perspective

1990
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:27,838
so it's a challenge yeah but i do think

1991
01:02:26,798 --> 01:02:29,280
it's

1992
01:02:27,838 --> 01:02:30,880
there probably is a place of too much

1993
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:31,839
community and we haven't even talked

1994
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:33,280
about i mean you could go to the

1995
01:02:31,838 --> 01:02:35,279
spectrum of talking about

1996
01:02:33,280 --> 01:02:36,640
cults or what does that mean and you

1997
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:38,240
know some people i when i

1998
01:02:36,639 --> 01:02:39,838
when the students come on our program i

1999
01:02:38,239 --> 01:02:42,159
often ask them like how many of you

2000
01:02:39,838 --> 01:02:42,960
in just the whole application and set up

2001
01:02:42,159 --> 01:02:45,358
to this process

2002
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:46,000
someone said to you oh you're joining a

2003
01:02:45,358 --> 01:02:48,000
culture

2004
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:50,000
and with all of them raised their hands

2005
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:52,000
and to me it's an important

2006
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:53,440
question yeah but for me a cult is

2007
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:55,599
really about

2008
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:56,798
a mindset of restricting individual

2009
01:02:55,599 --> 01:02:59,440
growth and freedom

2010
01:02:56,798 --> 01:03:01,199
you know you have to think this way and

2011
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:02,559
um you know it's taking away freedoms

2012
01:03:01,199 --> 01:03:04,480
and all that and the the programs the

2013
01:03:02,559 --> 01:03:06,880
communities we go to it's all about

2014
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:08,318
nourishing growth and freedom and saying

2015
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:09,280
how do we support you become who you

2016
01:03:08,318 --> 01:03:11,519
want to be

2017
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:12,960
and so there really is and also cults

2018
01:03:11,519 --> 01:03:14,159
are very unfortunate when they show up

2019
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:16,000
in the form of community

2020
01:03:14,159 --> 01:03:17,440
but they can also just as easily show up

2021
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:20,639
in a board room

2022
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:21,838
microsoft or military i mean come on uh

2023
01:03:20,639 --> 01:03:23,440
schools i mean the cult

2024
01:03:21,838 --> 01:03:26,480
we should be looking we should always be

2025
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:28,838
on the lookout for the cult mentality

2026
01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:30,240
but it can exist in many areas in our

2027
01:03:28,838 --> 01:03:32,880
lives

2028
01:03:30,239 --> 01:03:33,919
i don't want to end on that so i'm not

2029
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:36,720
asking questions

2030
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:36,720
one more question

2031
01:03:37,358 --> 01:03:42,719
i don't know if there's only that's fine

2032
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:46,079
i'm happy to talk to you

2033
01:03:42,719 --> 01:03:46,879
have any experience with any communities

2034
01:03:46,079 --> 01:03:50,318
that

2035
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:52,640
um have a specific strong focus on

2036
01:03:50,318 --> 01:03:53,358
agriculture i guess i'm thinking like

2037
01:03:52,639 --> 01:03:56,719
was the

2038
01:03:53,358 --> 01:03:58,159
campbell village steiner biodynamic yeah

2039
01:03:56,719 --> 01:04:00,078
there's camp hill they're all over the

2040
01:03:58,159 --> 01:04:01,598
world um i actually

2041
01:04:00,079 --> 01:04:03,920
where i used to live in southern new

2042
01:04:01,599 --> 01:04:05,838
hampshire high mowing and there's a

2043
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:06,639
there's a whole camp hill type place

2044
01:04:05,838 --> 01:04:08,719
there

2045
01:04:06,639 --> 01:04:09,679
um almost associated with high mowing

2046
01:04:08,719 --> 01:04:12,159
seats

2047
01:04:09,679 --> 01:04:13,838
no oh i don't know i don't think so no

2048
01:04:12,159 --> 01:04:15,358
it's actually a boarding high school

2049
01:04:13,838 --> 01:04:17,920
but there's also i can't remember the

2050
01:04:15,358 --> 01:04:20,960
name oh it just went through my

2051
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:23,358
mind it has an l in it um but

2052
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:24,960
any eco village or sustainable community

2053
01:04:23,358 --> 01:04:25,679
that's worth it salt or that is going to

2054
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:29,119
continue

2055
01:04:25,679 --> 01:04:31,199
has to work with food serious

2056
01:04:29,119 --> 01:04:32,880
we are challenged because we're on a

2057
01:04:31,199 --> 01:04:34,399
hilltop and so

2058
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:36,480
very often you dig down a foot and you

2059
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:37,358
hit bedrock and so we've been building

2060
01:04:36,480 --> 01:04:39,440
up the soil

2061
01:04:37,358 --> 01:04:41,358
using permaculture methods but we still

2062
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:42,240
produce maybe 30 or 40 percent of our

2063
01:04:41,358 --> 01:04:45,199
own food

2064
01:04:42,239 --> 01:04:46,000
uh fin horn again does a lot more but

2065
01:04:45,199 --> 01:04:48,000
it's not just

2066
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:49,358
its own gardens they work a lot with

2067
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:51,920
surrounding regions

2068
01:04:49,358 --> 01:04:53,759
oroville is probably much better at that

2069
01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:54,880
i guess they're probably in the 80 to 90

2070
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:57,039
producing their own food

2071
01:04:54,880 --> 01:04:59,039
and another important point to make is

2072
01:04:57,039 --> 01:04:59,760
that a lot of people think oh it's a

2073
01:04:59,039 --> 01:05:02,799
goal of all

2074
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:04,640
eco-villages to be self-sufficient right

2075
01:05:02,798 --> 01:05:06,719
to be able to kind of do their own thing

2076
01:05:04,639 --> 01:05:08,400
that's not been my experience in fact

2077
01:05:06,719 --> 01:05:09,759
it's really the opposite eco villages

2078
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:10,480
that we bring students to are very

2079
01:05:09,760 --> 01:05:12,559
porous

2080
01:05:10,480 --> 01:05:13,519
and they're often they see themselves as

2081
01:05:12,559 --> 01:05:16,400
catalysts

2082
01:05:13,519 --> 01:05:17,038
in the region how do we help farmers in

2083
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:20,480
our area

2084
01:05:17,039 --> 01:05:23,039
become more organic how do we create

2085
01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:24,559
local networks and distribution networks

2086
01:05:23,039 --> 01:05:26,400
so that we can

2087
01:05:24,559 --> 01:05:28,000
ship goods locally and not have to ship

2088
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:30,079
them from north of india or

2089
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:31,920
overseas or things like that so it's not

2090
01:05:30,079 --> 01:05:32,720
just about hey how do we grow more of

2091
01:05:31,920 --> 01:05:34,720
our own food

2092
01:05:32,719 --> 01:05:36,399
it's how do we create more of a

2093
01:05:34,719 --> 01:05:38,798
sustainable bioregion

2094
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:41,519
and maybe maybe that's the unit that we

2095
01:05:38,798 --> 01:05:45,119
should be thinking of becoming more

2096
01:05:41,519 --> 01:05:45,119
self-dependent or self-sufficient

2097
01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:48,960
yeah and certainly there i'm thinking of

2098
01:05:47,679 --> 01:05:50,558
other

2099
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:52,159
i can't think off the top my head of

2100
01:05:50,559 --> 01:05:52,798
communities that that's their central

2101
01:05:52,159 --> 01:05:54,798
focus

2102
01:05:52,798 --> 01:05:57,679
they probably are but it's certainly a

2103
01:05:54,798 --> 01:05:57,679
focus of everyone

2104
01:05:57,838 --> 01:06:02,239
good yeah all right thank you all this

2105
01:06:01,039 --> 01:06:06,000
is fun

2106
01:06:02,239 --> 01:06:08,558
um yeah i'm gonna be talking at um

2107
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:09,358
alice cook at seven o'clock if you know

2108
01:06:08,559 --> 01:06:12,798
anyone

2109
01:06:09,358 --> 01:06:15,920
who's interested um so did you ever

2110
01:06:12,798 --> 01:06:18,400
get a hold of the eco house no

2111
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:19,280
no i didn't i didn't even remember them

2112
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:21,358
did you just say that

2113
01:06:19,280 --> 01:06:22,640
last time i actually stayed there i just

2114
01:06:21,358 --> 01:06:24,639
spoke at the eco house at

2115
01:06:22,639 --> 01:06:27,519
suny geneseo yesterday so i think yeah

2116
01:06:24,639 --> 01:06:27,519
but no that's difficult

2117
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:33,358
this has been a production of cornell

2118
