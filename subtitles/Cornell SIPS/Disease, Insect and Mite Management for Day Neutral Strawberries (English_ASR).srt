00:00:09,638 --> 00:00:13,638
hello and welcome again to the NASA

2
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:16,000
winter webinar series we're happy to

3
00:00:13,638 --> 00:00:18,919
have you with us today for the third and

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,198
final in this first miniseries on day

5
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:23,439
neutral strawberry production we're

6
00:00:20,199 --> 00:00:25,080
going to be uh discussing diseases with

7
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:27,599
Dr Frank Lowe's from North Carolina

8
00:00:25,079 --> 00:00:29,278
State University and insect and might

9
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:31,920
management with Dr David Handley from

10
00:00:29,278 --> 00:00:34,238
the University of Maine just wanted to

11
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:37,039
tell you that the first two webinar

12
00:00:34,238 --> 00:00:38,799
recordings are posted in the archive

13
00:00:37,039 --> 00:00:39,799
you'll see in the web links box there's

14
00:00:38,799 --> 00:00:42,558
a Barry

15
00:00:39,799 --> 00:00:44,959
archive uh when you click on that it

16
00:00:42,558 --> 00:00:47,280
will take you to the uh Cornell fruit

17
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:49,480
website where we have all of our Barry

18
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,320
webinars recorded and you'll be able to

19
00:00:49,479 --> 00:00:53,479
listen to those

20
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:55,159
recordings if you've not participated in

21
00:00:53,479 --> 00:00:57,078
a webinar before I'm just going to

22
00:00:55,159 --> 00:00:59,198
remind you that you can type your

23
00:00:57,079 --> 00:01:01,399
comments or questions into the chat box

41
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,039
Carolina State University he grew up

42
00:01:55,359 --> 00:01:58,879
with a farming background including

43
00:01:57,039 --> 00:02:00,640
strawberry production and has worked

44
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:02,319
with strawberry diseases the past 15

45
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:06,159
years at

46
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:08,159
NCSU uh Dr low seeks to develop IPM

00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:09,679
programs that help Growers do their best

48
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:11,878

Alternatives and seeking new knowledge

54
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,760
about the biology and management of

55
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:28,160
folar fruit and Crown rot

56
00:02:24,759 --> 00:02:32,159
pathogens Frank all right thank you very

57
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:35,400
much Kathy and am I coming through okay

58
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:37,639
great excellent okay well thank you very

59
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:39,400
much for the invitation and it's good to

60
00:02:37,639 --> 00:02:41,359
have all these attendees I see a lot of

61
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:44,158
friends in different places in Canada

62
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:46,920
and the US and uh many people I don't

63
00:02:44,158 --> 00:02:48,318
know um but it's great to have you here

64
00:02:46,919 --> 00:02:49,958
uh I'm going to talk about integrated

65
00:02:48,318 --> 00:02:52,439
disease management of

66
00:02:49,959 --> 00:02:54,640
strawberries and a lot of my data and

67
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:57,400
information is biased towards plastic

68
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:59,559
culture systems but uh the information

69
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:01,760
is transferable to a lot of systems I

70
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:04,120
think you know the biology and what we

71
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:06,439
know uh will apply to matted Rose

72
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:09,599
systems as well as to the day neutral

73
00:03:06,439 --> 00:03:12,079
strawberry systems and before I get into

74
00:03:09,598 --> 00:03:13,878
the data and the information I just

75
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:18,920
wanted to highlight some key

76
00:03:13,878 --> 00:03:21,518
players um oh we have um Dr Mauser Ramen

77
00:03:18,919 --> 00:03:23,639
here and then showing here he's um a

78
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:25,519
posto that's done a lot of this work and

79
00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:28,119
he just got a faculty position at West

80
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:30,959
Virginia so we're um very pleased for

81
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:33,719
the opportunity he has m KS is a student

82
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:35,959
here at NCSU and he's worked a lot with

83
00:03:33,719 --> 00:03:38,158
Dr Ramen to generate a lot of the data

84
00:03:35,959 --> 00:03:40,120
we have uh Jim driver also is a

85
00:03:38,158 --> 00:03:42,359
technician in my program and he's

86
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:45,640
provided a lot of the support and field

87
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:47,159
work that we do and finally Rob Welker

88
00:03:45,639 --> 00:03:49,359
uh has done a lot of work in managing

89
00:03:47,158 --> 00:03:51,120
our methyl bromate alternative program

90
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:55,000
and I'm only going to show two or three

91
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:57,799
slides about that towards the end of the

92
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,360
talk we also get a lot of great support

93
00:03:57,799 --> 00:04:02,280
from grower associations you SDA the

94
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:04,480
southern region Center and we do a lot

95
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:06,759
of on farm work so we're highly

96
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:09,119
appreciative of what Growers do and how

97
00:04:06,759 --> 00:04:11,598
we interact with

98
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:14,239
them there's a lot of diseases that hit

99
00:04:11,598 --> 00:04:16,478
strawberry and you know here I highlight

100
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:18,840
minor diseases in terms of what we see

101
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:22,639
in our production systems it's not true

102
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:25,039
across uh across the area uh we probably

103
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:26,680
run into more fyo Crown rot but say

104
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:29,319
maybe in Ontario they might run into

105
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:31,120
more Red Steel issues uh I'm just going

106
00:04:29,319 --> 00:04:33,800
to highlight a few of the diseases and

107
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:36,399
problems the most prevalent ones that

108
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:38,759
occur in our production

109
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:40,439
systems the first thing that I want to

110
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:43,439
highlight and one of the most important

111
00:04:40,439 --> 00:04:45,360
things as a diagnostician you know I'll

112
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:48,160
go in a field and I'll I'll often ask

113
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:50,520
the question try to discern if the

114
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:53,400
problem is a living factor or is it a

115
00:04:50,519 --> 00:04:56,680
non-living factor and for example might

116
00:04:53,399 --> 00:04:59,799
have excess Boron High fertilizer which

117
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:01,319
can cause Leaf necrosis and plant death

118
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:04,000
and it could look like certain Crown rot

119
00:05:01,319 --> 00:05:06,399
diseases so just uh Discerning what the

120
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:10,918
issue is and of course A lot of times

121
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:13,279
it's not that easy um so Most states

122
00:05:10,918 --> 00:05:15,038
provinces Etc have very good diagnostic

123
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:16,959
facilities and it's going to be very

124
00:05:15,038 --> 00:05:20,759
important to figure out what the issue

125
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:22,560
is uh to implement proper control and so

126
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:25,038
uh getting the proper identification is

127
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:27,199
a a key part of an IPM

128
00:05:25,038 --> 00:05:29,240
program there's a lot of diseases that

129
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:31,560
hit strawberries and I'm not going to

130
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:33,560
talk about the mall uh for

131
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:36,600
example um

132
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:38,600
phyra where you have leather rot that's

133
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:41,240
occurs in certain production systems and

134
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:43,240
matted Rose systems soil based systems

135
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:46,439
we don't see it much here in North

136
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:48,478
Carolina uh powdery Meo is a big issue

137
00:05:46,439 --> 00:05:51,600
and I know a presentation was made not

138
00:05:48,478 --> 00:05:53,758
too long ago uh on powder milw and I

139
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,879
know in more Northern production areas

140
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:57,919
there's more Leaf Scorch leaf spot

141
00:05:55,879 --> 00:06:00,918
issues uh we don't see them as much in

142
00:05:57,918 --> 00:06:02,198
our annual systems um but you know we

143
00:06:00,918 --> 00:06:04,639
might have questions if you have

144
00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:06,319
questions we're we're happy to answer

145
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:07,199
questions about issues you might have

146
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:09,439
run

147
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:12,639
into I'm going to start with

148
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:17,199
betrus and with betrus um the most

149
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:19,840
important thing is uh just a biology of

150
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:22,680
the organism and what I what I'm showing

151
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:24,439
here are three key things related to

152
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:27,519
biology organism and this is generally

153
00:06:24,439 --> 00:06:30,560
true uh I'm showing here circling it in

154
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:34,159
red a ped and you can see a lot of

155
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:37,120
sporulation of betrus on there now in

156
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:39,000
our production systems the betrus can

157
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:43,120
live on green tissue and then when that

158
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:45,120
green tissue dies it sporulates on those

159
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:48,319
dead and dying on that dead and dying

160
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:50,560
tissue but then the pathogen will I'm

161
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:52,039
showing with this green arrow here the

162
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:54,680
pathogen gets in through the flower

163
00:06:52,038 --> 00:06:57,079
through the stamans and it appears that

164
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:59,360
about 90% of the fruit infection

165
00:06:57,079 --> 00:07:00,079
actually occurs through the flower and

166
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,759
then

167
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:06,719
over here in the top right which is what

168
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:08,439
I highlight is C you can see the erritis

169
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,360
gray mold rot occurring and it's

170
00:07:08,439 --> 00:07:13,038
starting at the kaix end so that

171
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:15,720
infection occurred through the flower

172
00:07:13,038 --> 00:07:17,519
and that happens uh it's felt about 90%

173
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:20,360
of the time here in the lower left where

174
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:22,079
we have B you can see betrus and it's

175
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:24,280
colonizing the lower part of the berry

176
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:26,159
well that colonization could have

177
00:07:24,279 --> 00:07:29,119
happened could have happened because a

178
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:31,960
flower petal fell on the berry and or

179
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:34,720
you see it sitting on decaying residue

180
00:07:31,959 --> 00:07:39,000
and then the betrus gets in and the key

181
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:41,599
thing here is that the

182
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:44,120
the understanding the biology helps us

183
00:07:41,598 --> 00:07:45,918
understand management so petritis

184
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:49,360
primarily gets in through the flower so

185
00:07:45,918 --> 00:07:51,680
we focus on how to manage that enum uh

186
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:54,038
before it gets into the flower and in

187
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:56,560
our annual systems we've done a lot of

188
00:07:54,038 --> 00:07:58,839
work where we plant in October and then

189
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:02,158
we manage that crop over the winter and

190
00:07:58,839 --> 00:08:04,478
then we find that the crop the leaves

191
00:08:02,158 --> 00:08:06,439
that over winter will die in the spring

192
00:08:04,478 --> 00:08:09,240
and this becomes a very important source

193
00:08:06,439 --> 00:08:11,680
of inoculum and so we feel we need to

194
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:14,800
really concentrate in this time period

195
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:18,038
for managing betrus and I'll talk about

196
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:20,240
you know how we do that uh both from a

197
00:08:18,038 --> 00:08:21,918
cultural management or a fungicide

198
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:24,519
management

199
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:28,079
approach sometimes we will see betrus

200
00:08:24,519 --> 00:08:30,359
hit the crown you can see on this plant

201
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:33,519
you can see the lower crown is colonized

202
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:35,918
by betrus this often happens if there's

203
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:38,360
some Bloom that occurs that bloom gets

204
00:08:35,918 --> 00:08:40,519
Frost killed then the betrus will grow

205
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:43,719
down the bloom stems and then start

206
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:46,278
colonizing the crown and if you have

207
00:08:43,719 --> 00:08:49,120
thick plants uh cool wet conditions

208
00:08:46,278 --> 00:08:50,838
you'll see that Crown rot in those cases

209
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:53,959
a lot of times it doesn't knock out the

210
00:08:50,839 --> 00:08:56,320
plant it can set the plant back um but

211
00:08:53,958 --> 00:08:58,439
if you do use fungicides a product like

212
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:01,040
switch or rool which has systemic

213
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:03,839
activities uh does a very nice job to

214
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:06,838
limit the damage from Crown

215
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:09,079
rot so if we think about managing

216
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:11,839
petritis um one of the most important

217
00:09:09,078 --> 00:09:13,479
things um is to manage fertility you

218
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:15,120
know if you have excess fertility you

219
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:18,560
may or may not get more yield you get

220
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:20,839
softer fruit you have more betrus damage

221
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:22,639
Optimum plant spacing that's different

222
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:25,680
of course in a plastic ulture system

223
00:09:22,639 --> 00:09:28,480
versus matted row but excess density of

224
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:30,159
plants will have more uh high humidity

225
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:33,440
conditions where that is and where the

226
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:36,759
berry is and then we'll get more plant

227
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:38,800
uh or more fruit Rod I put here remove

228
00:09:36,759 --> 00:09:42,360
dead and dying leaves so if you're an

229
00:09:38,799 --> 00:09:45,559
organic grower uh in perennial systems

230
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:47,919
as well as in annual systems if you can

231
00:09:45,559 --> 00:09:50,000
remove that dead and dying leaves before

232
00:09:47,919 --> 00:09:52,879
Bloom you can decrease your inoculum

233
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,879
load a lot now betrus of course produces

234
00:09:52,879 --> 00:09:57,919
lots of spores and then once it starts

235
00:09:54,879 --> 00:10:00,838
it produces a lot more but we've seen

236
00:09:57,919 --> 00:10:03,319
data where that procedure can decrease

237
00:10:00,839 --> 00:10:05,800
petritis incidents by up to

238
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:08,278
50% if you use

239
00:10:05,799 --> 00:10:11,078
fungicides some of the chemistry we have

240
00:10:08,278 --> 00:10:13,559
now is so good on betrus that it

241
00:10:11,078 --> 00:10:15,799
probably doesn't pay you know to spend

242
00:10:13,559 --> 00:10:18,518
$300 or $400 an acre removing dead and

243
00:10:15,799 --> 00:10:19,519
dying leaves it probably doesn't pay to

244
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:22,120
reduce

245
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:24,039
petritis and then uh we talked about

246
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:26,399
initiating fungicide sprays at first

247
00:10:24,039 --> 00:10:28,480
Bloom and then if you use fungicides to

248
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:30,240
make sure you rotate the chemistry to

249
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:32,440
avoid any problem with developing

250
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:34,320
resistance in the population and I'll

251
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:35,360
come back to specific recommendations

252
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,720
and

253
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:40,399
products the second disease I wanted to

254
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:43,079
talk about is in thros you can see here

255
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:45,879
an annual system and I know this happens

256
00:10:43,078 --> 00:10:48,078
a lot in Ontario Ohio other production

257
00:10:45,879 --> 00:10:51,159
regions uh this looks like a beautiful

258
00:10:48,078 --> 00:10:53,120
field it got a great fruit load and

259
00:10:51,159 --> 00:10:55,559
there was no indication of disease until

260
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:58,120
that fruit started coming on and then we

261
00:10:55,559 --> 00:11:01,719
had wet very hot conditions we had a

262
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:04,039
severe epidemic of fractos in that field

263
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:06,560
and so the organisms that we're

264
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:09,519
concerned about one is col tocum

265
00:11:06,559 --> 00:11:11,239
acutatum it causes a fruit rot this is

266
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:14,759
kind of the typhoid Miry for us as

267
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:17,519
strawberry Growers the second one Gus

268
00:11:14,759 --> 00:11:21,639
katum gases a lot of Growers here call

269
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:24,078
it the glow and katum feri they cause a

270
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:26,560
crown rot and we consider these uh to be

271
00:11:24,078 --> 00:11:29,519
of low to moderate importance in terms

272
00:11:26,559 --> 00:11:31,518
of the incidence as well as the amount

273
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:35,919
of damage that they might occur uh for

274
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:37,440
us as an industry and I'll talk about um

275
00:11:35,919 --> 00:11:38,439
both the crown rot and the fruit rot

276
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:42,880
that we run

277
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:45,399
into the reason that the um acutum are

278
00:11:42,879 --> 00:11:47,320
so important uh I'm not sure what this

279
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:50,519
green line is here there some kind of

280
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:53,040
quirk in the system but a lot of the

281
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:55,278
anthros does come in on the transplants

282
00:11:53,039 --> 00:11:57,519
this is especially true for copticum

283
00:11:55,278 --> 00:12:00,759
acutatum it can be very important for

284
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:03,839
glyos perides although lepides has a

285
00:12:00,759 --> 00:12:05,879
very wide Host range and Dr Ramen here

286
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:09,160
and folks in Florida have shown that

287
00:12:05,879 --> 00:12:12,799
wild host Place host species can be a

288
00:12:09,159 --> 00:12:15,198
very important source of the problem but

289
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:17,000
uh plant source is very important and

290
00:12:15,198 --> 00:12:19,519
once the organism is introduced to the

291
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:22,600
field it lives on the leaves and green

292
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:25,039
leaves and then it can sporulate either

293
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:26,959
on the green leaves or dead tissue then

294
00:12:25,039 --> 00:12:29,240
it goes to the berry and causes lesions

295
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:32,198
on the berry and then we get this

296
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:34,399
secondary buildup of the disease and

297
00:12:32,198 --> 00:12:38,000
here in our systems we can run from 0 to

298
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:41,440
80% fruit rot in a 14-day time span when

299
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:44,159
the weather is favorable so it's very

300
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:46,600
devastating um this is a slide Dr Ramen

301
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:48,639
put together just showing over here on

302
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:51,519
the right what anthros fruit rot will

303
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:54,039
look like and on the lower left we see a

304
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:57,039
plant that's wilting and if we look over

305
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:59,958
at the crown here we can see marbling

306
00:12:57,039 --> 00:13:01,879
internal in the crown I used to think

307
00:12:59,958 --> 00:13:03,719
that was fairly diagnostic but sometimes

308
00:13:01,879 --> 00:13:06,399
it's hard to tell from

309
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:08,240
phyra um because the the two can have

310
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:11,679
similar

311
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:13,440
symptoms the anthros also can affect the

312
00:13:11,679 --> 00:13:16,319
uh especially the acutatum strain the

313
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:18,160
young tissue and if you grow plug plants

314
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:19,560
you can have severe epidemics in plug

315
00:13:18,159 --> 00:13:22,240
production systems you see the young

316
00:13:19,559 --> 00:13:26,399
tissue here being damaged over here you

317
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:28,560
can see pedal with damage on the it C

318
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:31,480
can cause a flower blast or early fruit

319
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:35,278
damage and also can cause a black dry

320
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:37,480
rot on green fruit so acutatum can cause

321
00:13:35,278 --> 00:13:42,759
multiple symptoms on a

322
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:44,399
plant gpres likewise we can see um in

323
00:13:42,759 --> 00:13:47,240
addition to the crown rot sometimes

324
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:49,519
we'll see these lesions on the leaves

325
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:52,360
and glos forides is in that tissue and

326
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:55,480
we can PCR it out of that

327
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:57,600
tissue we've had some severe epidemics

328
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:59,920
in the lower left here you can see

329
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:01,480
there's a 60,000 plant plug plants you

330
00:13:59,919 --> 00:14:04,039
can see the severe damage that's being

331
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:06,600
caused by acutatum and we see a range of

332
00:14:04,039 --> 00:14:09,159
symptoms where the plug plant did not

333
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:11,639
grow out or it grew out and is not

334
00:14:09,159 --> 00:14:13,958
Thrifty and sometimes we can even see

335
00:14:11,639 --> 00:14:17,639
kind of a black root rot associated with

336
00:14:13,958 --> 00:14:21,319
that cotum acutum strain uh it's mostly

337
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:24,159
a foler upper uh and a fruit problem but

338
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:27,639
it can affect the roots

339
00:14:24,159 --> 00:14:29,600
also when we do a lot of work with the

340
00:14:27,639 --> 00:14:31,759
kums um we

341
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:35,560
we use uh what we know about its biology

342
00:14:31,759 --> 00:14:38,919
to assay the plant uh here on the left

343
00:14:35,559 --> 00:14:40,719
you can see a leaf and you can see uh

344
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:42,719
large collections of spores on the

345
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,839
leaves what we do is we dip that leaf in

346
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:47,040
gramoxone that immediately kills the

347
00:14:44,839 --> 00:14:49,639
leaf and then within four five 7even

348
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:53,120
days the fungus will grow out of that

349
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:55,879
tissue and here is a closeup and you can

350
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:57,919
see just billions of spores uh in that

351
00:14:55,879 --> 00:15:00,078
small area and then if a rain splash

352
00:14:57,919 --> 00:15:03,319
hits that those spor pores will get

353
00:15:00,078 --> 00:15:06,078
dispersed and splashed to the next Berry

354
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:09,600
and cause a severe epidemic but we use

355
00:15:06,078 --> 00:15:11,439
this paraquat method to assay it we also

356
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:14,278
anasa has supported this we've also

357
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:16,759
developed and implemented realtime PCR

358
00:15:14,278 --> 00:15:18,600
assays and other um High throughput

359
00:15:16,759 --> 00:15:20,959
diagnostic methods to advance our

360
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:24,480
ability to detect the

361
00:15:20,958 --> 00:15:27,198
pathogen um so let me review in thos uh

362
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:28,560
we saw that in many cases infested

363
00:15:27,198 --> 00:15:29,639
plants are the main source of the

364
00:15:28,559 --> 00:15:32,318
disease

365
00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:35,680
in our experience the pathogen does not

366
00:15:32,318 --> 00:15:37,799
survive well from one crop to another uh

367
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:40,039
if you have a nice break in between like

368
00:15:37,799 --> 00:15:43,198
a summer break or a winter break here we

369
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:44,759
have a summer break from June to October

370
00:15:43,198 --> 00:15:46,719
uh of course in maded Rose systems you

371
00:15:44,759 --> 00:15:49,959
would might have rotation systems or a

372
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:52,199
winter break um and then we saw that

373
00:15:49,958 --> 00:15:54,559
infested tips can lead to widespread

374
00:15:52,198 --> 00:15:56,838
problems the pathogen comes in as

375
00:15:54,559 --> 00:15:59,719
quiescent infections and then it can

376
00:15:56,839 --> 00:16:02,319
spread to the fruit and glyos can be an

377
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:05,079
alternative host and uh cause problems

378
00:16:02,318 --> 00:16:06,838
from those alternative host so if we

379
00:16:05,078 --> 00:16:09,000
think about management the most

380
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:11,440
important IPM tool is to get

381
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:14,440
disease-free plants and I say that

382
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:16,240
tongue and cheek because in many cases

383
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:18,440
it could be in the nursery but not

384
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:20,278
showing any symptoms and then we take it

385
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:23,079
to the fuing field or the plug

386
00:16:20,278 --> 00:16:25,879
greenhouse and then it expresses itself

387
00:16:23,078 --> 00:16:28,879
and so um you know we can only follow

388
00:16:25,879 --> 00:16:31,278
the best protocols possible uh through C

389
00:16:28,879 --> 00:16:34,600
certification or third party uh

390
00:16:31,278 --> 00:16:36,919
inspections um and and we have great

391
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:39,000
relationships with our Nursery providers

392
00:16:36,919 --> 00:16:41,919
and they are you know we have very good

393
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:44,159
Nursery Growers uh that seek and prevent

394
00:16:41,919 --> 00:16:47,479
these kind of issues from

395
00:16:44,159 --> 00:16:50,318
occurring uh if you do see ennos on a

396
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:53,039
few plants let's say both of them if you

397
00:16:50,318 --> 00:16:55,198
see Crown rot or if you see the acutum

398
00:16:53,039 --> 00:16:58,000
stre in the fruit rot if it's a small

399
00:16:55,198 --> 00:16:59,559
hot spot we've had success in roguing

400
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,879
out those plants and then you need to

401
00:16:59,559 --> 00:17:03,479
bury or burn those plants to make sure

402
00:17:01,879 --> 00:17:06,480
the inoculum is

403
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:08,480
destroyed if you do use fungicides then

404
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:11,759
the strobilar fungicides have been

405
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:13,199
excellent uh products for doing that and

406
00:17:11,759 --> 00:17:16,640
then I'll provide some specific

407
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:19,240
recommendations of how they might be

408
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:20,600
used in our work I just give you a

409
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:22,480
little bit of background of how we

410
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:24,918
approach um you know solving these

411
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:26,798
problems one you know I think grower

412
00:17:24,919 --> 00:17:28,199
knowledge and you know what the

413
00:17:26,798 --> 00:17:30,400
scientific knowledge that we have about

414
00:17:28,199 --> 00:17:33,640
the biology is critical to managing the

415
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:35,559
things and I hope I gave an idea of that

416
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:38,400
uh we always want to use as many tools

417
00:17:35,558 --> 00:17:40,279
as we can to manage the problem and

418
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:42,880
that's pretty consistent from production

419
00:17:40,279 --> 00:17:45,200
system to production system and then in

420
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:46,720
our protocols when we get a new product

421
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:49,600
we screen for the efficacy of the

422
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:51,880
product we try to see what spectrum of

423
00:17:49,599 --> 00:17:54,319
pathogens it controls and then we try to

424
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:55,600
integrate that into Management systems

425
00:17:54,319 --> 00:17:57,720
for our

426
00:17:55,599 --> 00:17:59,319
Growers there's a lot of products that

427
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:02,600
have come on the market in the last few

428
00:17:59,319 --> 00:18:05,359
years uh some of the old ones are still

429
00:18:02,599 --> 00:18:07,959
available uh we have protectants we have

430
00:18:05,359 --> 00:18:09,319
systemics uh and this is a list of uh a

431
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:11,480
number of the products that are

432
00:18:09,319 --> 00:18:13,918
available at least in the US some of the

433
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:16,120
names are different in Canada I know uh

434
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:18,799
but we have a good Arsenal uh in the

435
00:18:16,119 --> 00:18:20,439
last number of years this would be an

436
00:18:18,798 --> 00:18:23,639
example of a field trial that we would

437
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:27,480
do and Jim driver shown here with a weed

438
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:30,440
whacker but it shows uh he does often he

439
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:32,759
puts out the fungicide trial for us so

440
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:34,519
this is some early data we got um when

441
00:18:32,759 --> 00:18:38,879
we first were getting a hold of products

442
00:18:34,519 --> 00:18:42,279
like uh quadrus uh switch and Elevate

443
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:44,520
and I just show here how betrus fruit

444
00:18:42,279 --> 00:18:47,158
mold increased especially we get it in

445
00:18:44,519 --> 00:18:49,079
the early season when it's cool and wet

446
00:18:47,159 --> 00:18:52,080
uh and then you can see how switch and

447
00:18:49,079 --> 00:18:54,720
Elevate are very Superior petritis

448
00:18:52,079 --> 00:18:57,119
Products and then the stroby luren if

449
00:18:54,720 --> 00:19:00,720
you just have straight strobies they're

450
00:18:57,119 --> 00:19:00,719
they provide modest control of

451
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:09,440
petritis and um this is data that Mauser

452
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:11,679
recently developed in 2009 um many of

453
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:13,600
our Growers uh here I just wanted to

454
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:15,000
highlight you know if we have nine

455
00:19:13,599 --> 00:19:17,599
fungicide

456
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:20,440
sprays um we can get very good control

457
00:19:17,599 --> 00:19:24,038
of betrus so if we move here to the

458
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:27,320
right we can see that um we can have

459
00:19:24,038 --> 00:19:29,200
anywhere from 4 to 6% betrus grey mold

460
00:19:27,319 --> 00:19:34,000
now this is over the whole season we can

461
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:35,519
see 15 18 25% in the early season but if

462
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,720
you average out the whole season it

463
00:19:35,519 --> 00:19:41,400
works out to be about 5% year in and

464
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:44,400
year out um but you can see if we use a

465
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:46,960
nine uh week spray program we can reduce

466
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:49,480
that to below 2% but what's very

467
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:52,079
important this relates to the biology is

468
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:54,079
that if we use four well time sprays

469
00:19:52,079 --> 00:19:55,918
during Bloom and you got to remember

470
00:19:54,079 --> 00:19:59,240
here in North Carolina we'll have an

471
00:19:55,919 --> 00:20:01,038
extended Bloom time and you need to

472
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:04,880
confer with your local extension but in

473
00:20:01,038 --> 00:20:07,200
matted row systems uh two well time

474
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:10,360
fungicides will where you have a very

475
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:13,840
succinct um Bloom period it appears like

476
00:20:10,359 --> 00:20:16,439
two sprays might be enough but we use

477
00:20:13,839 --> 00:20:19,158
captan and then the P stands for

478
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:21,798
pristine and then switch so we do captan

479
00:20:19,159 --> 00:20:24,360
pristine switch pristine and you can see

480
00:20:21,798 --> 00:20:26,599
those four well time sprays give us as

481
00:20:24,359 --> 00:20:29,279
good control as nine sprays through the

482
00:20:26,599 --> 00:20:34,480
whole season and so that relates to the

483
00:20:29,279 --> 00:20:36,918
biology organism now for um the um day

484
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:38,558
neutral strawberry production system uh

485
00:20:36,919 --> 00:20:40,919
you know maybe that can be a point of

486
00:20:38,558 --> 00:20:42,519
discussion uh mostly you know day

487
00:20:40,919 --> 00:20:44,000
neutrals might be dealing with more

488
00:20:42,519 --> 00:20:45,960
summer weather we don't have the cool

489
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,279
wet season it may not be as big of an

490
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:50,600
issue so we can talk about that if

491
00:20:48,279 --> 00:20:53,158
necessary we do a lot of work in post

492
00:20:50,599 --> 00:20:56,959
Harvest fruit rot um you can see our

493
00:20:53,159 --> 00:20:59,200
tray here and you can see some rows uh

494
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:00,960
which represents a given treatment where

495
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:03,640
we have almost no mold and way on the

496
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:07,720
bottom here you can see Almost 100% gry

497
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:10,038
mold uh in the control and so we have

498
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:12,519
some excellent data and just on the top

499
00:21:10,038 --> 00:21:16,400
left here you can see if the control is

500
00:21:12,519 --> 00:21:18,200
not sprayed we can have 85% fruit rot so

501
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:20,519
these fruit are harvested with no

502
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:23,159
symptoms we surface sterilize them to

503
00:21:20,519 --> 00:21:26,558
get rid of ripus then we incubate them

504
00:21:23,159 --> 00:21:29,360
and then we get 85% of the fruit growing

505
00:21:26,558 --> 00:21:30,960
with petritis and you see if we use

506
00:21:29,359 --> 00:21:33,319
switch or pristine or some of these

507
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:35,038
other programs uh the amount of post

508
00:21:33,319 --> 00:21:37,200
Harvest fruit Rod is substantially

509
00:21:35,038 --> 00:21:39,599
reduced there's a new product coming on

510
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:42,440
the market Luna sensation it also gives

511
00:21:39,599 --> 00:21:45,798
good post Harvest fruit rot

512
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:48,240
control this is a slide of annos again

513
00:21:45,798 --> 00:21:50,960
talking about um you know we can go from

514
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:52,558
zero to 80% fruit rot in four days uh in

515
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:55,079
this case the plot is showing number of

516
00:21:52,558 --> 00:21:57,200
fruit but you can see how serious it is

517
00:21:55,079 --> 00:22:00,439
and if we look at the

518
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:03,919
strobilurin um we get excellent control

519
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:05,840
as well as Captivate that combination um

520
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:07,559
seems to give good suppression of betrus

521
00:22:05,839 --> 00:22:10,439
and it's mostly the captain ingredient

522
00:22:07,558 --> 00:22:12,879
that does the work overall the stroby

523
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:15,720
lens are better than Captain but Captain

524
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:19,039
is an important partner in an anthros

525
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:21,400
Management program thym uh in Florida

526
00:22:19,038 --> 00:22:23,240
they use a lot of thym uh but that's

527
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:24,559
because they spray so much and they have

528
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:27,400
limitations on how many times they can

529
00:22:24,558 --> 00:22:30,639
use captan we have not seen thyrm

530
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:32,559
perform as well for in fractos

531
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:34,559
management I want to highlight this

532
00:22:32,558 --> 00:22:37,440
slide it's a bit dark but what this

533
00:22:34,558 --> 00:22:40,798
shows is we have the non-treated control

534
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:42,798
where we had 68% in thros and then you

535
00:22:40,798 --> 00:22:45,200
can see where we have a

536
00:22:42,798 --> 00:22:47,519
program

537
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:50,880
um sorry I hit the wrong button we can

538
00:22:47,519 --> 00:22:53,759
see we have a program where what we have

539
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:55,919
uh a 26% and tros

540
00:22:53,759 --> 00:22:58,798
incident and

541
00:22:55,919 --> 00:23:01,080
um that's with Captain pristine and then

542
00:22:58,798 --> 00:23:04,519
we also did a captain abound program or

543
00:23:01,079 --> 00:23:07,278
quadrus and we're seeing uh we're seeing

544
00:23:04,519 --> 00:23:09,158
compromise in our program here and over

545
00:23:07,278 --> 00:23:12,440
the last 2 three years we've seen a

546
00:23:09,159 --> 00:23:15,080
bound and pristine uh fail now some of

547
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:17,400
you Growers might say wow 26% of thos is

548
00:23:15,079 --> 00:23:20,199
still a lot but you have to remember

549
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:22,840
that what we do is we leave control

550
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:24,400
plots so we leave unsprayed portions and

551
00:23:22,839 --> 00:23:26,399
there's a lot of spores produced in

552
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:29,600
those and they will Splash disperse to

553
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:32,000
our fungicide trial um where we have

554
00:23:29,599 --> 00:23:34,000
treatments and so most Growers that I

555
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:37,359
know don't leave unsprayed controlled

556
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:40,640
plots if they have anthos in their

557
00:23:37,359 --> 00:23:43,639
field um but this just shows you the

558
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:46,120
data pristine gave excellent results

559
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:48,038
abound started to compromise the control

560
00:23:46,119 --> 00:23:49,719
and quadrus compromised it even more

561
00:23:48,038 --> 00:23:51,480
even even though it's the same active

562
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:55,079
ingredient and then you can see the

563
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:58,079
control uh we had up to 70% fruit rot in

564
00:23:55,079 --> 00:24:00,480
that particular Harvest so we are shying

565
00:23:58,079 --> 00:24:03,480
away from Quadris abound recommendations

566
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:06,120
for anthros management now those strains

567
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:08,000
this is with the acutatum strains those

568
00:24:06,119 --> 00:24:09,678
and we don't have a handle on this why

569
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,558
that is so we're trying to understand

570
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:12,600
that

571
00:24:10,558 --> 00:24:16,720
better uh what I did want to highlight

572
00:24:12,599 --> 00:24:18,719
too again if we use a 8 weeks program

573
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:21,919
program we get excellent control of

574
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:24,400
anthracnose fruit rot and then Natalia

575
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:26,320
Perez and uh uh recently there's a

576
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:30,679
number of players who have joined her

577
00:24:26,319 --> 00:24:33,398
group Mike Ellison Ohio mark l in Iowa

578
00:24:30,679 --> 00:24:37,278
Asen North Carolina G schabo in South

579
00:24:33,398 --> 00:24:40,839
Carolina and others um using forecasting

580
00:24:37,278 --> 00:24:43,359
methods and with that model uh Dr Ramen

581
00:24:40,839 --> 00:24:45,879
could show that three well time sprays

582
00:24:43,359 --> 00:24:49,558
based on weather patterns offered equal

583
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:52,960
to equal control of anthros as compared

584
00:24:49,558 --> 00:24:54,558
to uh you know weekly sprays I think

585
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:56,640
this is going to be really important for

586
00:24:54,558 --> 00:24:59,038
people who have stretched out

587
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:00,960
Seasons um so that you don't have to

588
00:24:59,038 --> 00:25:03,000
spend too much money in funer sdes but

589
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:05,278
really link it to weather and with some

590
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:07,079
of the new local weather tools that are

591
00:25:05,278 --> 00:25:10,278
becoming available I can foresee this

592
00:25:07,079 --> 00:25:12,639
become an important part of our future

593
00:25:10,278 --> 00:25:14,720
programs uh I just want to highlight

594
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:17,480
where a lot of our IPM recommendations

595
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:17,480
are if you go to

596
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:30,360
smallfly valuable

597
00:25:28,919 --> 00:25:32,520
I wanted to highlight some of the stuff

598
00:25:30,359 --> 00:25:34,798
we put in there uh we put efficacy

599
00:25:32,519 --> 00:25:38,639
tables in so if you're going to use a

600
00:25:34,798 --> 00:25:40,398
certain fungicide you can go across here

601
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:43,038
and you know see how it performs for

602
00:25:40,398 --> 00:25:45,639
different pathogens you might encounter

603
00:25:43,038 --> 00:25:48,558
and I just zoomed in on some of that

604
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:51,200
data uh for a bound you know we've

605
00:25:48,558 --> 00:25:53,278
degraded its rating for ennos but

606
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:55,000
something like pristine gives excellent

607
00:25:53,278 --> 00:25:56,720
betrus control because it's got a

608
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:00,200
boscalid component it's got a good

609
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:02,038
betrus side and and ennos product in

610
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:05,960
there uh so it gives good control of

611
00:26:02,038 --> 00:26:08,798
both Captain is modest on both um

612
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:10,840
Captivate we saw Elevate Elevate just

613
00:26:08,798 --> 00:26:12,480
gives excellent control of Bettis and

614
00:26:10,839 --> 00:26:14,480
with that Captain component in the

615
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:16,919
Captivate we also get some anthracnose

616
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:18,880
activity and likewise switch is a great

617
00:26:16,919 --> 00:26:23,520
betri

618
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:26,399
tode um so let me go back there um so

619
00:26:23,519 --> 00:26:29,038
knowing this efficacy data uh I think

620
00:26:26,398 --> 00:26:31,319
you just got to select a product to

621
00:26:29,038 --> 00:26:33,879
manage the problems that you know are in

622
00:26:31,319 --> 00:26:36,639
your field so if you don't have anthros

623
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:39,559
and you're mostly concerned about Bettis

624
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:41,880
switch and Elevate rotated with captan

625
00:26:39,558 --> 00:26:44,158
give you an excellent petritis program

626
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:46,559
and also good disease resistance but if

627
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:48,278
you have anthos or concerned about it

628
00:26:46,558 --> 00:26:50,599
then you probably need to incorporate

629
00:26:48,278 --> 00:26:52,720
pristine in your program and it also

630
00:26:50,599 --> 00:26:54,759
gives good petritis activity so just in

631
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:56,480
terms of principles in fungicide

632
00:26:54,759 --> 00:26:59,119
management that's how I would approach

633
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:01,720
it um I just want to hit two other

634
00:26:59,119 --> 00:27:04,319
diseases real quick if I to the crown

635
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:05,759
rot we can see how the pathogen grew

636
00:27:04,319 --> 00:27:08,278
into the middle of the crown cause

637
00:27:05,759 --> 00:27:12,440
severe problems that plant will

638
00:27:08,278 --> 00:27:14,839
collapse um what we find is that uh if I

639
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:17,600
if I take roots and I use a razor blade

640
00:27:14,839 --> 00:27:19,558
and just scrape those black roots we can

641
00:27:17,599 --> 00:27:22,359
find o spores in the roots and those

642
00:27:19,558 --> 00:27:25,558
survive in the soil for years and years

643
00:27:22,359 --> 00:27:28,199
the pathogens a water mold and over here

644
00:27:25,558 --> 00:27:31,278
in the bottom right part of its cycle is

645
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:33,640
zoospores which can swim and so that

646
00:27:31,278 --> 00:27:35,798
really affects some management

647
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:38,038
recommendations you know for phyo

648
00:27:35,798 --> 00:27:41,158
management you need excellent good uh

649
00:27:38,038 --> 00:27:42,919
good soil drainage and just decrease any

650
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:44,519
potential for standing water where the

651
00:27:42,919 --> 00:27:47,120
phyo might get

652
00:27:44,519 --> 00:27:50,399
started that of course is true for uh

653
00:27:47,119 --> 00:27:51,439
Red Steel also uh for our more Northern

654
00:27:50,398 --> 00:27:54,558
production

655
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:56,600
regions uh in our IPM guide where people

656
00:27:54,558 --> 00:27:59,038
use fumigation we have a table that just

657
00:27:56,599 --> 00:28:00,439
helps for product selection

658
00:27:59,038 --> 00:28:02,240
especially if you combine it with some

659
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:04,600
of the new Plastics like virtually

660
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:07,880
impermeable film we see excellent

661
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:11,158
efficacy of a range of pest and it will

662
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:13,880
knock out phyto in the fumigated Zone

663
00:28:11,159 --> 00:28:17,120
but phyto can come back into the bed

664
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:19,679
with a Vengeance if you have a lot of

665
00:28:17,119 --> 00:28:22,599
water um then the products that are

666
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:25,960
available rmal gold one pint per treated

667
00:28:22,599 --> 00:28:30,079
acre um and so that would be the actual

668
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:32,319
amount applied in the road so in in our

669
00:28:30,079 --> 00:28:34,278
plastic culture system if you have two

670
00:28:32,319 --> 00:28:36,759
acres of physical land there's only one

671
00:28:34,278 --> 00:28:39,640
acre under plastic so you'd apply a pint

672
00:28:36,759 --> 00:28:41,440
to that two acres of physical land uh

673
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:44,320
and then the pro phosphites also give

674
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:46,278
good control not as good as rimil but

675
00:28:44,319 --> 00:28:48,558
their strength is that they that product

676
00:28:46,278 --> 00:28:50,480
can be absorbed through the foliage so

677
00:28:48,558 --> 00:28:53,759
if the roots are damaged then the

678
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:56,558
phosphite can be folar applied and then

679
00:28:53,759 --> 00:28:59,038
you also can get some um response to

680
00:28:56,558 --> 00:29:01,079
that if you have phyter problem

681
00:28:59,038 --> 00:29:02,599
rmal gold it's really good to get it in

682
00:29:01,079 --> 00:29:04,398
the root system because it's only picked

683
00:29:02,599 --> 00:29:06,678
up by the roots and then mooved to the

684
00:29:04,398 --> 00:29:09,398
leaves and then we really like to link

685
00:29:06,679 --> 00:29:11,360
those applications to crop phenology so

686
00:29:09,398 --> 00:29:13,199
in our plastic culture systems we know

687
00:29:11,359 --> 00:29:15,199
we get rapid root growth in the fall

688
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:16,798
soon after planting and then right

689
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:19,240
around this time of year we get rapid

690
00:29:16,798 --> 00:29:21,278
root growth uh shown in the green so

691
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:23,919
that's when we want to have our

692
00:29:21,278 --> 00:29:26,398
applications uh to control

693
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:29,360
phyto then I just want to talk briefly

694
00:29:26,398 --> 00:29:31,558
about angular Lea spot zanth bonus uh

695
00:29:29,359 --> 00:29:33,959
it's very host specific it can only

696
00:29:31,558 --> 00:29:36,678
survive in association with living plant

697
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:39,159
tissue or strawberry residue once that

698
00:29:36,679 --> 00:29:42,798
residue breaks down the pathogen dies

699
00:29:39,159 --> 00:29:45,360
out um we can see uh symptoms in the

700
00:29:42,798 --> 00:29:47,879
field possibly stunting and if you look

701
00:29:45,359 --> 00:29:50,319
at the leaf especially on the underside

702
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:52,640
you would get a lot of bacteria oozing

703
00:29:50,319 --> 00:29:54,278
out or if it's not that advanced if you

704
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:56,640
hold that leaf to the light you can look

705
00:29:54,278 --> 00:29:58,919
through those lesions they're

706
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:00,759
translucent um it can cause a lot of

707
00:29:58,919 --> 00:30:02,799
damage one of the biggest problems we

708
00:30:00,759 --> 00:30:05,079
have we might not get many folar

709
00:30:02,798 --> 00:30:07,759
symptoms but the pathogen colonizes the

710
00:30:05,079 --> 00:30:09,918
kaix the KX gets these ugly looking

711
00:30:07,759 --> 00:30:12,679
symptoms uh you can see them here at the

712
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:15,320
lower right the lesions and then that

713
00:30:12,679 --> 00:30:16,679
distracts from the aesthetic value of

714
00:30:15,319 --> 00:30:20,759
the of the

715
00:30:16,679 --> 00:30:23,480
product we don't have a lot of um useful

716
00:30:20,759 --> 00:30:25,359
tools you know healthy plants is the

717
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:28,038
most important tool getting it from

718
00:30:25,359 --> 00:30:30,199
nurseries that don't have a problem uh

719
00:30:28,038 --> 00:30:32,200
limiting overhead watering and fro

720
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:33,519
protection it seems to be aggravated by

721
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:37,200
fro

722
00:30:33,519 --> 00:30:39,159
protection and we do recommend copper

723
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:41,360
sprays to prevent it from getting on the

724
00:30:39,159 --> 00:30:43,519
kaix but we've done experience

725
00:30:41,359 --> 00:30:45,119
experiments putting on 11 copper sprays

726
00:30:43,519 --> 00:30:47,558
through the winter and

727
00:30:45,119 --> 00:30:51,278
season Without Really impacting the

728
00:30:47,558 --> 00:30:53,519
amount of disease so it's a tough one um

729
00:30:51,278 --> 00:30:55,319
there's work uh by a group in Florida

730
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:56,679
looking at Heat Treating of tips or

731
00:30:55,319 --> 00:30:58,278
plants you know before they go into the

732
00:30:56,679 --> 00:31:00,278
nursery to prevent the problem from

733
00:30:58,278 --> 00:31:02,960
spreading uh so there's more work to be

734
00:31:00,278 --> 00:31:05,278
done there uh finally I just wanted to

735
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:08,399
highlight um in terms of diseases you

736
00:31:05,278 --> 00:31:09,558
know it takes an IPM approach um we do

737
00:31:08,398 --> 00:31:11,719
in fair amount of work with host

738
00:31:09,558 --> 00:31:14,158
resistance we looked at reduced spray

739
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:16,639
programs we un we know looking at the

740
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:19,519
biology fertility programs can have a

741
00:31:16,638 --> 00:31:21,519
impact on disease uh detection and

742
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:23,759
weather forecasting systems integrating

743
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:26,159
all these things are very important at

744
00:31:23,759 --> 00:31:29,079
the grower level and The Interchange

745
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:31,080
between the science and practice growing

746
00:31:29,079 --> 00:31:33,398
strawberries finally I just want to

747
00:31:31,079 --> 00:31:35,319
highlight two slides about fumigation

748
00:31:33,398 --> 00:31:38,000
we've done a lot of work with uh looking

749
00:31:35,319 --> 00:31:40,839
at fumigation as many of you know methyl

750
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:43,398
bromide is uh pretty well phased out for

751
00:31:40,839 --> 00:31:46,278
strawberry use this slide shows if we

752
00:31:43,398 --> 00:31:49,158
treat with methyl bromide we can use

753
00:31:46,278 --> 00:31:54,119
straight chloropicrin piine uh drip

754
00:31:49,159 --> 00:31:56,519
apply 13d chloropicrin this is um like a

755
00:31:54,119 --> 00:31:58,918
c kind of like a c35 formulation or we

756
00:31:56,519 --> 00:32:01,399
can shank apply it we can use matam

757
00:31:58,919 --> 00:32:03,720
sodium either shank and Rota tilled in

758
00:32:01,398 --> 00:32:06,119
or drip applied and we can make all

759
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:09,399
these work products work with similar

760
00:32:06,119 --> 00:32:10,798
efficacy as methyl bromide uh so

761
00:32:09,398 --> 00:32:12,278
technically sometimes they're more

762
00:32:10,798 --> 00:32:14,879
challenging to work with in terms of

763
00:32:12,278 --> 00:32:18,679
soil conditions uh in our systems if we

764
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:21,440
don't fumigate we get about a 60 to 80%

765
00:32:18,679 --> 00:32:25,720
crop yield our main problem is black

766
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:27,240
root rot that's true for most areas um

767
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:28,880
and if you have plant Killers like

768
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:30,759
verticillium

769
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:32,440
uh then fumigation can also be very

770
00:32:30,759 --> 00:32:35,240
critical then you can have total plant

771
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:36,720
death but mostly we get plant stunting

772
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:38,960
so we do have these alternative

773
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:40,839
fumigants uh also we've done a lot of

774
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:44,240
work at looking at biologically based

775
00:32:40,839 --> 00:32:46,158
systems and cover crops um in the summer

776
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:48,599
we can grow a cover crop and then we add

777
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:50,639
compost we work that in together we pull

778
00:32:48,599 --> 00:32:54,519
the beds in September we manage that

779
00:32:50,638 --> 00:32:56,479
crop over the winter and um we can get

780
00:32:54,519 --> 00:32:59,159
excellent yields and we've seen some of

781
00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:02,159
our Growers transition to Organics uh

782
00:32:59,159 --> 00:33:05,360
using crop rotations cover crops and

783
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:06,880
biologically based systems so those are

784
00:33:05,359 --> 00:33:08,918
the things that I wanted to highlight

785
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:11,399
just to emphasize the importance of

786
00:33:08,919 --> 00:33:13,519
identifying the biology if you're an

787
00:33:11,398 --> 00:33:17,158
organic grower then management becomes

788
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:18,919
key as opposed to uh external inputs um

789
00:33:17,159 --> 00:33:20,799
if you're not an organic grower we have

790
00:33:18,919 --> 00:33:22,159
some excellent fungicide products and if

791
00:33:20,798 --> 00:33:25,000
they're used

792
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:27,200
judiciously related to the biology

793
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,880
potential of forecasting and in proper

794
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:30,319
rotation I think they will continue to

795
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:33,559
be excellent tools for us in the

796
00:33:30,319 --> 00:33:35,038
industry so Kathy um that brings me the

797
00:33:33,558 --> 00:33:36,759
end of my presentation and then I'll

798
00:33:35,038 --> 00:33:40,440
turn it back to

799
00:33:36,759 --> 00:33:43,119
you we do have time for one or two

800
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:45,519
questions Tom is asking if you can

801
00:33:43,119 --> 00:33:48,000
comment about organic

802
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:49,759
materials um in terms of betrus and

803
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,038
anthros products we've done a fair

804
00:33:49,759 --> 00:33:55,960
amount of work with Biologicals

805
00:33:52,038 --> 00:33:58,519
Organics um so if we get let's say if we

806
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:59,759
get 80% 90% control with some of the

807
00:33:58,519 --> 00:34:02,679
fungicide

808
00:33:59,759 --> 00:34:06,638
products oh man you know we might get 10

809
00:34:02,679 --> 00:34:09,838
20 30% control I don't think you can

810
00:34:06,638 --> 00:34:11,918
rely on organic products as a main

811
00:34:09,838 --> 00:34:14,039
strategy to manage these folar and fruit

812
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:16,679
diseases you need a whole integrated

813
00:34:14,039 --> 00:34:16,679
Management

814
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:22,358
program okay are there are there other

815
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:22,358
questions for

816
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:30,878
Frank uh there's a comment from Raymond

817
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:33,598
from Poland fluazinam or chlorothalonil

818
00:34:30,878 --> 00:34:35,679
active substance can be effective that's

819
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:38,879
true you know certain places have the

820
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:41,398
products registered for those uses and

821
00:34:38,878 --> 00:34:44,398
um you know we don't have chlorothalonil

822
00:34:41,398 --> 00:34:48,039
registered um so that depends on you

823
00:34:44,398 --> 00:34:48,039
know your location of your production

824

system okay we'll have a chance to ask

825
00:34:50,599 --> 00:34:56,879
Frank some more questions uh at the end

826
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:59,200

David okay um I hope everyone can hear

846
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:44,000
me if I've got this thing set up

847
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:47,160
right and mo my presentation to while

848
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,159
we're waiting did you have a

849
00:35:47,519 --> 00:35:53,358
question if you could type your question

850
00:35:49,679 --> 00:35:53,358
into the chat box

851
00:36:06,119 --> 00:36:13,559
me to go ahead Kathy sure Roger we'll

852
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:16,318
get your question uh at the end

853
00:36:13,559 --> 00:36:18,639
okay okay um

854
00:36:16,318 --> 00:36:20,920
like like Frank what I want to do is

855
00:36:18,639 --> 00:36:23,879
concentrate on a couple of pests that

856
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:26,680
have shown to be most problematic in the

857
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:27,920
day neutral production systems we'll

858
00:36:26,679 --> 00:36:30,159
talk a little bit about some of the

859
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:32,000
minor pests on day neutrals which would

860
00:36:30,159 --> 00:36:34,039
be major pests if we were talking about

861
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:36,400
a perennial short day system like a man

862
00:36:34,039 --> 00:36:38,400
and row um but because we're talking

863
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:40,480
about Den neutral strawberries where we

864
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:42,400
look at flowering and fruiting to occur

865
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:45,000
later in the summer and into the fall in

866
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:47,400
most areas the pest complex tends to

867
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:50,318
shift a little bit and as a result of

868
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:51,519
that how we go after these particular

869
00:36:50,318 --> 00:36:53,400
pests and whether or not they're going

870
00:36:51,519 --> 00:36:56,000
to become a problem for you also is

871
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:59,480
affected by exactly uh what we're

872
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:03,358
growing and when it comes

873
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:05,119
but regardless the same philosophy of

874
00:37:03,358 --> 00:37:06,440
integrated Pest Management should be

875
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:08,920
applied whether we're talking about

876
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:10,519
short day plants or day neutral plants

877
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:12,760
talk about an integrated Pest Management

878
00:37:10,519 --> 00:37:14,960
or IPM program we're look really looking

879
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:17,160
at three major components that support

880
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:20,199
the system just as Frank discussed with

881
00:37:17,159 --> 00:37:21,759
diseases now with insects that first of

882
00:37:20,199 --> 00:37:23,639
those primary components is to actually

883
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:26,560
monitor for pest populations and this

884
00:37:23,639 --> 00:37:28,400
means getting out there and looking for

885
00:37:26,559 --> 00:37:30,559
the insects that see to be causing the

886
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:33,119
problem if indeed that is what you

887
00:37:30,559 --> 00:37:34,880
problem is being caused by and this is

888
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:36,640
different than just saying okay I know

889
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:38,039
that two- spotted spider mites or

890
00:37:36,639 --> 00:37:39,838
tarnish plant bug are going to be an

891
00:37:38,039 --> 00:37:41,599
issue so I'm going to start spraying as

892
00:37:39,838 --> 00:37:43,239
soon as I see some flower buds out there

893
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:46,359
and I'm going to continue on a 5-day

894
00:37:43,239 --> 00:37:48,318
program until I start picking that is

895
00:37:46,358 --> 00:37:50,199
not monitoring P that's just assum you

896
00:37:48,318 --> 00:37:52,318
have a problem in throwing everything

897
00:37:50,199 --> 00:37:54,559
you've got at it uh that tends to be the

898
00:37:52,318 --> 00:37:56,000
Le least costeffective method of going

899
00:37:54,559 --> 00:37:57,679
after this a better method is to

900
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,838
actually go out determine whether not

901
00:37:57,679 --> 00:38:02,199
you have the pest before you go uh

902
00:37:59,838 --> 00:38:04,920
spending a lot of money on chemicals and

903
00:38:02,199 --> 00:38:07,118
the equipment you need to put down the

904
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:09,400
second component is using action

905
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:11,160
thresholds to determine exactly when to

906
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:13,519
spray and this goes hand inand with the

907
00:38:11,159 --> 00:38:15,759
first part once we discover that we have

908
00:38:13,519 --> 00:38:18,239
some pests out there is it really worth

909
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:21,520
going after them that question really

910
00:38:18,239 --> 00:38:23,479
comes down to a matter of economics if I

911
00:38:21,519 --> 00:38:25,358
only have one bug out there it is not

912
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:26,960
going to cause enough damage to justify

913
00:38:25,358 --> 00:38:29,480
the money I would have to invest in

914
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:31,519
sprayer my time and the and the sprayer

915
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:34,800
itself uh to get out there and do

916
00:38:31,519 --> 00:38:36,519
anything about it but at some point the

917
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:38,440
damage that a number of insects are

918
00:38:36,519 --> 00:38:40,960
going to cause will indeed cause

919
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:42,599
economic harm that will surpass what it

920
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:44,280
cost me to control it and that's what

921
00:38:42,599 --> 00:38:46,400
your action threshold is so your action

922
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:48,640
threshold is just telling you right now

923
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:50,400
is the time to apply that and and it

924
00:38:48,639 --> 00:38:52,679
doesn't mean when the insects first

925
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:54,760
arrive it means that we're going to wait

926
00:38:52,679 --> 00:38:57,118
until over at a level where we can no

927
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:58,640
longer tolerate them and the third

928
00:38:57,119 --> 00:39:01,000
component is using alternative

929
00:38:58,639 --> 00:39:02,679
management methods whenever possible to

930
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:04,880
keep those insects from ever reaching

931
00:39:02,679 --> 00:39:06,719
the action threshold so there are some

932
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:08,318
basic things we can do like using crop

933
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:09,679
rotation not planting strawberries in

934
00:39:08,318 --> 00:39:11,318
the same place year after year shift

935
00:39:09,679 --> 00:39:13,719
them around to make the insects follow

936
00:39:11,318 --> 00:39:15,639
you uh that can keep those populations

937
00:39:13,719 --> 00:39:17,838
down and then we can also use some more

938
00:39:15,639 --> 00:39:19,799
proactive things during the season like

939
00:39:17,838 --> 00:39:21,599
releasing Predators or parasites for

940
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:23,359
example to try to keep those insects

941
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:25,920
pressed so that we won't have to reel

942
00:39:23,358 --> 00:39:28,039
that sprayer out uh and those uh tests

943
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:30,240
will never reach the action fresh

944
00:39:28,039 --> 00:39:32,519
So based on those three components we

945
00:39:30,239 --> 00:39:34,078
can take a look at how to approach these

946
00:39:32,519 --> 00:39:36,519
pest problems that are going to become

947
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:39,560
an issue for us through the

948
00:39:36,519 --> 00:39:41,079
season so looking at some things you can

949
00:39:39,559 --> 00:39:43,639
do to keep those pests from ever

950
00:39:41,079 --> 00:39:45,119
reaching the action threshold uh first

951
00:39:43,639 --> 00:39:47,039
and foremost one of the things that

952
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:48,960
comes to mind is managing your Weeds now

953
00:39:47,039 --> 00:39:51,358
I know we're talking about uh insect

954
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:54,159
pests here but the two really go hand in

955
00:39:51,358 --> 00:39:56,799
hand uh weeds are an important component

956
00:39:54,159 --> 00:39:59,399
of how an insect is going to uh interact

957
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:01,800
with your crop first of all just having

958
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:03,920
the weeds in the crop weakens those

959
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:05,760
plants and as a result weak plants tend

960
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:06,880
to be more attractive to insect pest

961
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:08,520
there have been several studies that

962
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:10,760
have shown this depending on the species

963
00:40:08,519 --> 00:40:12,480
of insect that we're talking about but

964
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:14,520
we want to keep our plants healthy happy

965
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:16,358
growing and vigorous they become less

966
00:40:14,519 --> 00:40:17,599
appealing to insects in some cases but

967
00:40:16,358 --> 00:40:19,239
certainly they're better able to

968
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:20,680
tolerate insect injury if they're in

969
00:40:19,239 --> 00:40:23,000
good health and that's not going to

970
00:40:20,679 --> 00:40:24,919
happen if you have a lot of weeds there

971
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:26,119
secondly just having other plants in

972
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:28,519
with your strawberries is going to

973
00:40:26,119 --> 00:40:30,640
reduce the effectiveness of pesticides

974
00:40:28,519 --> 00:40:32,159
because they're going to block the uh

975
00:40:30,639 --> 00:40:34,118
materials from actually reaching the

976
00:40:32,159 --> 00:40:35,799
plants uh and getting the good kind of

977
00:40:34,119 --> 00:40:37,480
coverage that you want especially with

978
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:39,839
these uh newer pesticides where the

979
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:41,318
rates we're using are extremely low you

980
00:40:39,838 --> 00:40:43,519
want to make sure that you're getting

981
00:40:41,318 --> 00:40:45,239
very good coverage with that so it's not

982
00:40:43,519 --> 00:40:47,159
only a matter of making sure you have

983
00:40:45,239 --> 00:40:48,519
the best spray equipment possible to get

984
00:40:47,159 --> 00:40:50,239
that distribution but making sure

985
00:40:48,519 --> 00:40:51,639
there's nothing in the way uh that's

986
00:40:50,239 --> 00:40:54,039
going to block that pesticide from

987
00:40:51,639 --> 00:40:55,598
reaching the target where it needs to go

988
00:40:54,039 --> 00:40:57,480
and finally of course weeds also provide

989
00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:58,838
Harbors for insects they can hide out

990
00:40:57,480 --> 00:41:00,480
there they can overwinter there we'll

991
00:40:58,838 --> 00:41:03,279
talk about that more with the specific

992
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:05,519
insects and might problems and they act

993
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:06,760
as alternate hosts uh if for some reason

994
00:41:05,519 --> 00:41:08,960
the strawberries aren't available we're

995
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:10,800
going into winter or there's no fruit

996
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:12,920
available these act as places where the

997
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:14,119
insects can lay their eggs and uh be

998
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:15,880
well protected while you're busy

999
00:41:14,119 --> 00:41:18,160
spraying the strawberries uh they're

1000
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:20,000
happily uh producing the next round of

1001
00:41:18,159 --> 00:41:20,920
pests for you on the weed population at

1002
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,719
the edge

1003
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:25,880
of prop rotation as I mentioned earlier

1004
00:41:23,719 --> 00:41:27,799
is also very important so we can prevent

1005
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:30,119
pest populations from building up over

1006
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:31,760
time uh with day neutrals we're usually

1007
00:41:30,119 --> 00:41:34,640
talking about these plants only being in

1008
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:36,520
the ground one uh year in some cases I

1009
00:41:34,639 --> 00:41:37,960
know in Canada they're looking at uh

1010
00:41:36,519 --> 00:41:39,440
carrying them on to a second year and

1011
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:42,559
getting a a little bit of a spring

1012
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:44,119
Harvest off of them uh but regardless we

1013
00:41:42,559 --> 00:41:46,199
meanss we can put them on a relatively

1014
00:41:44,119 --> 00:41:47,960
short rotation program we can get out of

1015
00:41:46,199 --> 00:41:50,159
strawberries and put some other crop in

1016
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:52,079
there for a year or two which will not

1017
00:41:50,159 --> 00:41:53,279
encourage strawberry pest something that

1018
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:55,839
you know it's not going to share the

1019
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:57,920
same uh host uh attractiveness as

1020
00:41:55,838 --> 00:41:59,239
strawberries or we can can fumigate as

1021
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:01,480
Frank mentioned that's another way of

1022
00:41:59,239 --> 00:42:02,919
cleaning it up but fumigation has its

1023
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:05,358
own issues especially if you're an

1024
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:07,280
organic grower um which will bring us

1025
00:42:05,358 --> 00:42:10,318
down to the next one which is managing

1026
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:12,880
crop and soil Health uh we want to make

1027
00:42:10,318 --> 00:42:14,358
sure that the soil fertility is good so

1028
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:16,920
that our plants are vigorous and healthy

1029
00:42:14,358 --> 00:42:18,838
and can tolerate injury that may be uh

1030
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:21,200
they may be subjected to we want to make

1031
00:42:18,838 --> 00:42:22,759
sure our organic uh matter levels are

1032
00:42:21,199 --> 00:42:25,159
high so that the fertility we're adding

1033
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:27,599
to the soil is being uh properly

1034
00:42:25,159 --> 00:42:29,879
monitored by that soil so that it can uh

1035
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:31,440
the plants can have easy access to it

1036
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:33,800
and that it will be held in reserve it

1037
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:35,280
won't Le out for yeast and of course

1038
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:37,079
having lots of organic matter in the

1039
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:38,960
soil also increases the diversity of

1040
00:42:37,079 --> 00:42:40,680
Flora and Fauna that lives in that soil

1041
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:42,639
and that's actually a good thing once

1042
00:42:40,679 --> 00:42:45,399
you fumigate you've basically sterilized

1043
00:42:42,639 --> 00:42:48,078
the soil so that if a a bad fungi or bad

1044
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:49,680
insect soil insect P comes in there they

1045
00:42:48,079 --> 00:42:51,680
basically have no competition and can

1046
00:42:49,679 --> 00:42:53,480
run rampant through the soil whereas if

1047
00:42:51,679 --> 00:42:55,199
there are other flora and fauna in there

1048
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:57,880
some of which in fact the majority of

1049
00:42:55,199 --> 00:42:59,639
which are probably beneficial they can

1050
00:42:57,880 --> 00:43:01,599
help the plants if not actively

1051
00:42:59,639 --> 00:43:03,679
antagonize some of these pest species

1052
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:05,960
that are coming into play so managing

1053
00:43:03,679 --> 00:43:08,039
that crop and soil Health uh is a very

1054
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:09,280
important part of your insect Pest

1055
00:43:08,039 --> 00:43:11,000
Management strategy as well as your

1056
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:13,160
disease management

1057
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:15,639
strategy well let's go back to the

1058
00:43:13,159 --> 00:43:18,558
monitoring part of this uh IPM program

1059
00:43:15,639 --> 00:43:20,480
and that involves uh scouting typically

1060
00:43:18,559 --> 00:43:22,040
with a short day strawberry plant that

1061
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:23,719
they flower in the spring and it's a

1062
00:43:22,039 --> 00:43:25,599
relatively short flowering period we say

1063
00:43:23,719 --> 00:43:27,358
initiate your scouting at the flower Bud

1064
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:29,240
stage and you'll be able to keep up with

1065
00:43:27,358 --> 00:43:31,598
most of the pest and try to scout them

1066
00:43:29,239 --> 00:43:34,078
once or twice a week uh during that

1067
00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:35,599
flowering and fuing period when we talk

1068
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:36,760
about day neutrals however we're going

1069
00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:38,039
to plant them in the spring and we're

1070
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:39,960
usually going to pinch those first

1071
00:43:38,039 --> 00:43:41,480
flowers that come out so there's no

1072
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:43,838
sense in really worrying about then the

1073
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:45,920
only thing I'd be really worried about

1074
00:43:43,838 --> 00:43:47,719
early on in the season probably is mites

1075
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:49,880
or any of the folar feeding insects that

1076
00:43:47,719 --> 00:43:51,480
may start to show themselves early on

1077
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:53,240
but as far as the ones that are going to

1078
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:55,280
affect us directly in the pocketbook

1079
00:43:53,239 --> 00:43:56,519
with feeding on flowers and fruit

1080
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:58,319
probably don't need to do that until the

1081
00:43:56,519 --> 00:43:59,960
plants have been in the ground for about

1082
00:43:58,318 --> 00:44:01,558
four or five weeks and we've stopped

1083
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:03,480
pinching flowers and waiting for that

1084
00:44:01,559 --> 00:44:04,720
new set of flower buds to come out

1085
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:06,679
that's the time that we need to start

1086
00:44:04,719 --> 00:44:08,279
looking at things like tarnished plant

1087
00:44:06,679 --> 00:44:10,919
bug that have been a real headache on

1088
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:13,319
some of these day neutral uh production

1089
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:15,838
systems so I still say you might want to

1090
00:44:13,318 --> 00:44:17,239
do a little bit of uh scouting prior to

1091
00:44:15,838 --> 00:44:20,119
letting those flower bugs come out to

1092
00:44:17,239 --> 00:44:21,919
set fruit uh in the late summertime uh

1093
00:44:20,119 --> 00:44:23,280
but pretty much your intense scouting

1094
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:24,880
should start with that new set of flower

1095
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:26,880
BS the first set that you intend to

1096
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:28,280
fruit start showing themselves outside

1097
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:30,880
of the those

1098
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:32,400
crowns well what's the best way to scout

1099
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:34,039
ideally you would look at every plant in

1100
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:36,838
the field but of course that's just not

1101
00:44:34,039 --> 00:44:38,838
practical so what we want to do is get a

1102
00:44:36,838 --> 00:44:41,119
sample of that field that one doesn't

1103
00:44:38,838 --> 00:44:43,159
take us too much time and effort to do

1104
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:45,000
but on the other hand gives us a very

1105
00:44:43,159 --> 00:44:46,558
good representative sample of what

1106
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:48,599
actually is going on in the field as a

1107
00:44:46,559 --> 00:44:50,800
whole so if you look at these green bars

1108
00:44:48,599 --> 00:44:52,760
of rows of straw as rows of strawberries

1109
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:54,760
uh in a in a field if we were going to

1110
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:57,119
scout we'd want to come through and

1111
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:59,880
looking at these little stars and show

1112
00:44:57,119 --> 00:45:01,800
up as well as they did on my program um

1113
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:04,119
you can see that what we're doing here

1114
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:06,280
is stopping at five locations in that

1115
00:45:04,119 --> 00:45:07,838
field and these locations will kind of

1116
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:09,680
give us a pretty good representation of

1117
00:45:07,838 --> 00:45:11,960
what's going on in the field we don't

1118
00:45:09,679 --> 00:45:13,519
want to use the outside rows because

1119
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:15,440
they tend to be biased especially if

1120
00:45:13,519 --> 00:45:16,639
they're new we patches or brush or

1121
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:17,960
something like that where these pests

1122
00:45:16,639 --> 00:45:19,598
are coming in we want to come in a few

1123
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:21,119
rows nor do we want to be right at the

1124
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:22,960
ends of the rows we want to move into

1125
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:25,640
the field a little bit to again give us

1126
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:27,240
a better idea of exactly what's going on

1127
00:45:25,639 --> 00:45:29,960
but this is what I like to do in a field

1128
00:45:27,239 --> 00:45:31,159
that say 1 and 1/2 acres or less if it's

1129
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:32,720
if it's bigger than that I would

1130
00:45:31,159 --> 00:45:35,039
probably double this and go out to about

1131
00:45:32,719 --> 00:45:36,558
10 sites and at each site depending on

1132
00:45:35,039 --> 00:45:37,800
the insect I'm going to do different

1133
00:45:36,559 --> 00:45:39,960
things I'm either going to look at a

1134
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:42,318
certain length of row at each site uh

1135
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:43,559
counting damage or counting insects or

1136
00:45:42,318 --> 00:45:45,679
I'm going to be in the case of tarnished

1137
00:45:43,559 --> 00:45:47,960
plant bug whacking flower blossoms and

1138
00:45:45,679 --> 00:45:50,639
looking for NS or in the case of mites

1139
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:52,760
I'll be actually picking leaves in this

1140
00:45:50,639 --> 00:45:55,159
now bear in mind when I say you stop at

1141
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:56,760
one site if I've stopped at one site and

1142
00:45:55,159 --> 00:45:58,358
beat up a plant to look for one insect

1143
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:59,720
don't assume that that other insect that

1144
00:45:58,358 --> 00:46:01,159
I'm going to be looking for in a minute

1145
00:45:59,719 --> 00:46:02,439
is still there you might have to move

1146
00:46:01,159 --> 00:46:04,759
down the row a little bit because if you

1147
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:06,358
disturb the plants uh you've probably uh

1148
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:08,440
change what's going on in terms of the

1149
00:46:06,358 --> 00:46:09,639
pest population there but again I just

1150
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:11,358
wanted to get you an idea of how you

1151
00:46:09,639 --> 00:46:13,318
should distribute your monitoring

1152
00:46:11,358 --> 00:46:14,880
efforts through that field to make sure

1153
00:46:13,318 --> 00:46:17,480
that it's representative of the field as

1154
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:19,519
a whole so bottom line here is that

1155
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:20,679
driving by in the pickup at 30 miles an

1156
00:46:19,519 --> 00:46:22,679
hour and sticking your head out the

1157
00:46:20,679 --> 00:46:23,879
window is not adequate scouting you do

1158
00:46:22,679 --> 00:46:25,039
need to get out in the field and get

1159
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:27,079
down on your hands and knees and

1160
00:46:25,039 --> 00:46:29,000
actually look at these plants to see if

1161
00:46:27,079 --> 00:46:31,359
those pests are out

1162
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:33,159
there so let's move on to the specific

1163
00:46:31,358 --> 00:46:34,799
pests and as I said this is just based

1164
00:46:33,159 --> 00:46:37,279
on my experience with day neutrals and

1165
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:39,359
also talking to Growers that I've worked

1166
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:41,079
with with day neutrals the biggest pest

1167
00:46:39,358 --> 00:46:42,480
problems they've had to deal with as far

1168
00:46:41,079 --> 00:46:44,599
as insects are concerned and tarnish

1169
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:46,679
plant bug keeps bubbling up to the top

1170
00:46:44,599 --> 00:46:48,559
when we talk about tarnish plant bug the

1171
00:46:46,679 --> 00:46:50,399
damage you see here uh in the photo

1172
00:46:48,559 --> 00:46:52,800
these berries with very seed ends on

1173
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:55,519
them call apical seediness or cat facing

1174
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:57,160
or button berries um we tend to see

1175
00:46:55,519 --> 00:46:58,639
quite a bit of this with day neutral and

1176
00:46:57,159 --> 00:47:00,159
that's because unfortunately the day

1177
00:46:58,639 --> 00:47:01,799
neutrals tend to be flowering and

1178
00:47:00,159 --> 00:47:04,078
fruiting right at the time when the

1179
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:06,480
tarnish plant bug insect pest

1180
00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:08,039
populations are at their Peak uh we deal

1181
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:09,920
with these in the short day plants in

1182
00:47:08,039 --> 00:47:11,318
the spring too uh but we find with the

1183
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:13,358
day neutrals the pressure is even

1184
00:47:11,318 --> 00:47:15,639
greater and to add to our wos we run

1185
00:47:13,358 --> 00:47:17,920
into control problems whereas we want to

1186
00:47:15,639 --> 00:47:19,960
be spraying and protecting our plants

1187
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:21,680
when they're in the early bloom to late

1188
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:23,559
bloom stage for tarnish plant bug but

1189
00:47:21,679 --> 00:47:25,239
with day neutrals uh you find that you

1190
00:47:23,559 --> 00:47:27,480
have a lot of fruit ripe at the same

1191
00:47:25,239 --> 00:47:29,159
time so do you really want be spraying

1192
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:30,358
and harvesting at the same time and what

1193
00:47:29,159 --> 00:47:31,519
are your customers going to think of

1194
00:47:30,358 --> 00:47:32,960
that so you have to be very careful

1195
00:47:31,519 --> 00:47:35,679
about what products you select to

1196
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:37,559
control we talk about management uh

1197
00:47:35,679 --> 00:47:39,558
alternate hosts and flowering weeds play

1198
00:47:37,559 --> 00:47:42,040
a very important role in tarnished plant

1199
00:47:39,559 --> 00:47:43,960
bugs ability to succeed in your field uh

1200
00:47:42,039 --> 00:47:45,880
we want to avoid mowing during Bloom

1201
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:48,599
we'll talk more about this in a minute

1202
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:50,358
and uh we're using insecticides trying

1203
00:47:48,599 --> 00:47:52,800
to concentrate those during the pre and

1204
00:47:50,358 --> 00:47:54,318
post Bloom periods and trying to avoid

1205
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:57,240
going after them in full bloom when we

1206
00:47:54,318 --> 00:47:58,880
were hoping our pollinators going

1207
00:47:57,239 --> 00:48:00,558
if we look at the biology of this pest

1208
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:03,358
you can see an adult there on the top

1209
00:48:00,559 --> 00:48:05,240
photo feeding on the uh developing

1210
00:48:03,358 --> 00:48:06,679
strawberry flower that's the recepticle

1211
00:48:05,239 --> 00:48:07,959
of the flower which is actually the part

1212
00:48:06,679 --> 00:48:10,000
that's going to become your strawberry

1213
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:12,639
food and they feed on those developing

1214
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:14,519
Ain or seeds and by killing them uh

1215
00:48:12,639 --> 00:48:16,598
those seeds aren't going to give off a

1216
00:48:14,519 --> 00:48:18,358
growth regulator that will cause the the

1217
00:48:16,599 --> 00:48:19,880
lower part of the frood the recepticle

1218
00:48:18,358 --> 00:48:22,159
to swell and that's why we get that

1219
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:23,760
seediness they overwinter as an adults

1220
00:48:22,159 --> 00:48:25,598
and interestingly we don't feel that

1221
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:27,760
they do a particularly good job of that

1222
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:29,440
in other words the popul that emerges in

1223
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:31,559
the spring is quite a bit smaller than

1224
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:33,679
that that went to bed in the fall

1225
00:48:31,559 --> 00:48:35,559
however when those adults emerge the

1226
00:48:33,679 --> 00:48:38,118
first thing they start to do is look for

1227
00:48:35,559 --> 00:48:39,559
flowers and growing uh points to feed on

1228
00:48:38,119 --> 00:48:41,240
and as soon as they fatten up a bit they

1229
00:48:39,559 --> 00:48:43,000
start mating and laying eggs and they

1230
00:48:41,239 --> 00:48:46,358
like to lay their eggs in the leaf

1231
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:48,079
pedals and even the flower stems or

1232
00:48:46,358 --> 00:48:50,239
pedestals of the flowers and they just

1233
00:48:48,079 --> 00:48:52,480
insert their eggs into plant tissue and

1234
00:48:50,239 --> 00:48:54,078
they hatch in about 2 weeks then the

1235
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:56,559
little green nymphs as you can see in

1236
00:48:54,079 --> 00:48:58,318
the lower photo here uh will emerge and

1237
00:48:56,559 --> 00:49:00,240
then run around and start feeding on

1238
00:48:58,318 --> 00:49:02,079
again growing points or any reproductive

1239
00:49:00,239 --> 00:49:03,598
tissue they can find they like to feed

1240
00:49:02,079 --> 00:49:05,839
on growing points they like to feed on

1241
00:49:03,599 --> 00:49:07,160
flowers because nutrition wise that's

1242
00:49:05,838 --> 00:49:09,078
what's best for them it's a lot better

1243
00:49:07,159 --> 00:49:11,000
than plant fat there's more protein and

1244
00:49:09,079 --> 00:49:12,960
fats and things in those tissues than

1245
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:15,199
there are just poking into a leaf for

1246
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:16,159
example so that's where they concentrate

1247
00:49:15,199 --> 00:49:17,879
now what you need to know about the

1248
00:49:16,159 --> 00:49:20,159
nymphs is that they don't fly nor do

1249
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:22,160
they reproduce but the fact is that if

1250
00:49:20,159 --> 00:49:23,920
they lay the adults laid their eggs on

1251
00:49:22,159 --> 00:49:25,358
the flowers and stems of a strawberry

1252
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:26,880
plant when those nymphs emerge they've

1253
00:49:25,358 --> 00:49:28,159
got no place else to go they can't can't

1254
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:29,680
fly away so they're really going to

1255
00:49:28,159 --> 00:49:33,318
concentrate their efforts on those

1256
00:49:29,679 --> 00:49:34,960
strawberries um so that's why we need to

1257
00:49:33,318 --> 00:49:36,159
keep an eye on what what the adults are

1258
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:37,559
doing in your field and you know if

1259
00:49:36,159 --> 00:49:39,440
there are adults there that soon there's

1260
00:49:37,559 --> 00:49:40,880
going to be a lot of uh little nyss

1261
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:42,760
running around and feeding and and

1262
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:45,400
causing problems on

1263
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:47,000
flowers these NS will mol four or five

1264
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:48,720
times before they become adults and

1265
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:50,400
until they become adults they can't fly

1266
00:49:48,719 --> 00:49:52,719
or reproduce and we figure there's two

1267
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:54,880
or three gen Generations per year here

1268
00:49:52,719 --> 00:49:56,118
in the New England area alth those

1269
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:58,240
although those Generations are very

1270
00:49:56,119 --> 00:49:59,960
indistinct you don't see specific peaks

1271
00:49:58,239 --> 00:50:01,798
of populations they kind of overlap and

1272
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:04,159
run into each

1273
00:50:01,798 --> 00:50:05,679
other well as far as monitoring goes

1274
00:50:04,159 --> 00:50:07,558
there's really two techniques that are

1275
00:50:05,679 --> 00:50:09,318
used the first is trapping where we can

1276
00:50:07,559 --> 00:50:11,519
just stick up these white sticky traps

1277
00:50:09,318 --> 00:50:13,880
and we just nail them to little uh

1278
00:50:11,519 --> 00:50:15,159
stakes in the ground uh and those traps

1279
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:17,200
should be set at about the same height

1280
00:50:15,159 --> 00:50:18,598
as the canopy of a strawberry plant and

1281
00:50:17,199 --> 00:50:20,118
these are just covered with a sticky goo

1282
00:50:18,599 --> 00:50:21,559
and the tarnish plant bugs happen along

1283
00:50:20,119 --> 00:50:23,640
and think maybe that's a nice strawberry

1284
00:50:21,559 --> 00:50:24,880
flower and land on it and get stuck the

1285
00:50:23,639 --> 00:50:26,759
problem with these traps is everything

1286
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:29,039
else gets stuck on them too all

1287
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:32,640
different kinds of insects um a lot of

1288
00:50:29,039 --> 00:50:34,279
dirt and chaff uh occasional small bird

1289
00:50:32,639 --> 00:50:35,879
mouse gets stuck on them as well so they

1290
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:37,880
don't tend to be very pleasant to work

1291
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:39,240
with um I just like to use them in the

1292
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:40,798
edge of the field and take a look at

1293
00:50:39,239 --> 00:50:42,078
them once in a while and you have to

1294
00:50:40,798 --> 00:50:43,400
know what the tarnish plant bugs look

1295
00:50:42,079 --> 00:50:45,000
like and be able to sort them out from

1296
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:46,720
everything else that's on there but just

1297
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:48,559
to determine how many adults are are

1298
00:50:46,719 --> 00:50:50,879
flying around at any given time so I

1299
00:50:48,559 --> 00:50:52,240
know what to look for when I'm in the

1300
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:54,039
but the rubber really hits the road when

1301
00:50:52,239 --> 00:50:55,598
we move into the strawberry field itself

1302
00:50:54,039 --> 00:50:57,279
and start going after those NS because

1303
00:50:55,599 --> 00:50:58,680
the ns are what tend to cause most of

1304
00:50:57,280 --> 00:51:01,000
the injury especially later in the

1305
00:50:58,679 --> 00:51:02,759
season with these day neutral stws and

1306
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:05,039
you can see this is Sony SCH slowman my

1307
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:07,079
counterpart at UMass here and she's

1308
00:51:05,039 --> 00:51:08,639
taking a flower cluster and a little

1309
00:51:07,079 --> 00:51:10,519
white clipboard there and she's just

1310
00:51:08,639 --> 00:51:12,920
bashing a a flower cluster over the

1311
00:51:10,519 --> 00:51:15,599
clipboard I just put my hand behind it

1312
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:18,280
and give it three sharp wraps over I use

1313
00:51:15,599 --> 00:51:19,559
a white styrofoam plate and then uh if

1314
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:21,160
there are any nymphs on that flower

1315
00:51:19,559 --> 00:51:22,599
cluster they fall onto the plate and

1316
00:51:21,159 --> 00:51:24,598
they run around like crazy so you have

1317
00:51:22,599 --> 00:51:25,920
to look quick uh and then I just count

1318
00:51:24,599 --> 00:51:27,280
the nips that are coming off of those

1319
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:29,280
flower clust

1320
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:31,559
and we do that to 30 flower clusters in

1321
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:34,599
a field so remember that map from

1322
00:51:31,559 --> 00:51:36,280
earlier if we were going to uh go to

1323
00:51:34,599 --> 00:51:38,359
Five locations in a field we'd want to

1324
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:40,119
tap six clusters at each location and

1325
00:51:38,358 --> 00:51:41,719
again I tend to move down the row I

1326
00:51:40,119 --> 00:51:43,440
don't tap one cluster then go to the one

1327
00:51:41,719 --> 00:51:45,118
right beside it because tarnish plint

1328
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:47,838
bugs are very active and shy and if I

1329
00:51:45,119 --> 00:51:49,640
beat on one flower cluster I assume the

1330
00:51:47,838 --> 00:51:51,239
one right next to it is the imps have

1331
00:51:49,639 --> 00:51:53,519
already probably run off so I need to

1332
00:51:51,239 --> 00:51:55,679
move down the road a little

1333
00:51:53,519 --> 00:51:57,559
bit well let's talk about those

1334
00:51:55,679 --> 00:51:59,318
thresholds uh going to use the sticky

1335
00:51:57,559 --> 00:52:01,599
traps I'd say just use them to determine

1336
00:51:59,318 --> 00:52:03,480
whether the presence of adults is a

1337
00:52:01,599 --> 00:52:05,480
problem or not for most Growers I don't

1338
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:06,880
think it's really practical uh it's more

1339
00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:08,639
important that you get in there and tap

1340
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:10,200
those flower clusters and I would do

1341
00:52:08,639 --> 00:52:12,960
this with day neutrals I'd probably be

1342
00:52:10,199 --> 00:52:15,960
doing it twice a week um and I can

1343
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:19,119
sample three clusters in 10 SES to get

1344
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:21,559
my uh 30 flower clusters or six in five

1345
00:52:19,119 --> 00:52:23,440
SES depending on how big your field is

1346
00:52:21,559 --> 00:52:25,559
my threshold is quite simple if four of

1347
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:27,760
the flower clusters are infested with NS

1348
00:52:25,559 --> 00:52:29,720
out of the 30 that I tapped over my

1349
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:31,520
plate for an average of a quarter of a

1350
00:52:29,719 --> 00:52:34,159
NPH per cluster if that makes more sense

1351
00:52:31,519 --> 00:52:35,838
to you um it's time to do something so I

1352
00:52:34,159 --> 00:52:37,440
don't actually have to count NS I just

1353
00:52:35,838 --> 00:52:39,798
count the number of clusters that would

1354
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:43,039
infest it okay so one cluster really

1355
00:52:39,798 --> 00:52:44,960
means that I need to do something uh if

1356
00:52:43,039 --> 00:52:47,798
it had four tarnished plant bugs on it

1357
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:49,480
ah I don't really care uh I I just need

1358
00:52:47,798 --> 00:52:50,358
to know whether four out of the 30 had

1359
00:52:49,480 --> 00:52:52,880
any

1360
00:52:50,358 --> 00:52:54,639
NY and remember what you're looking for

1361
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:56,200
here the NYSE can be very small I've

1362
00:52:54,639 --> 00:52:58,719
just circled this little guy here and

1363
00:52:56,199 --> 00:53:00,239
that's compared to a strawberry uh aen

1364
00:52:58,719 --> 00:53:01,719
that you see right there so they can be

1365
00:53:00,239 --> 00:53:03,318
very small the thing to remember is that

1366
00:53:01,719 --> 00:53:05,199
they're also very active when they hit

1367
00:53:03,318 --> 00:53:06,759
the plate they're going to start running

1368
00:53:05,199 --> 00:53:08,239
as opposed to an aphid which can look

1369
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:09,599
very similar to this but when an aphid's

1370
00:53:08,239 --> 00:53:12,000
on the plate it's just going to sit

1371
00:53:09,599 --> 00:53:13,720
there it doesn't tend to move very fast

1372
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:15,199
um so learn to know what these things

1373
00:53:13,719 --> 00:53:16,639
look like they have the long antenna

1374
00:53:15,199 --> 00:53:19,318
they're light green or yellowish and

1375
00:53:16,639 --> 00:53:21,078
like I say they tend to move pretty fast

1376
00:53:19,318 --> 00:53:22,519
um and the other thing you need to know

1377
00:53:21,079 --> 00:53:23,599
about them is even as they get bigger

1378
00:53:22,519 --> 00:53:25,119
looking at the one that's a little

1379
00:53:23,599 --> 00:53:27,559
bigger here you can see the wing pads on

1380
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:29,039
it their color matches strawberry pretty

1381
00:53:27,559 --> 00:53:31,160
well uh this is one sitting on a

1382
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:32,679
strawberry seep so it's hard to see them

1383
00:53:31,159 --> 00:53:34,480
unless you get them onto the plate just

1384
00:53:32,679 --> 00:53:36,159
looking at the flower clusters uh

1385
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:37,960
they'll fall off the plant and play dead

1386
00:53:36,159 --> 00:53:39,598
on the ground where they're hard to find

1387
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:41,119
uh but the their color and their size

1388
00:53:39,599 --> 00:53:43,480
are issues for seeing them unless you

1389
00:53:41,119 --> 00:53:45,280
use this tapping method well what can

1390
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:47,039
you go with um there are many

1391
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:49,240
insecticides they're now labeled for

1392
00:53:47,039 --> 00:53:51,279
tarnish plant pug um some of them are

1393
00:53:49,239 --> 00:53:54,879
pretty hot materials which I tend to shy

1394
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:56,440
away from because uh if I can uh because

1395
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:57,838
the broadspectrum materials although

1396
00:53:56,440 --> 00:53:59,280
they control tarnished plant bug very

1397
00:53:57,838 --> 00:54:01,000
well they also tend to clean out any

1398
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:02,680
Predators or parasites you may have

1399
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:04,079
there which would be helping you with

1400
00:54:02,679 --> 00:54:05,960
not only tarnished plant bug but some

1401
00:54:04,079 --> 00:54:08,240
other things most especially two-

1402
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:10,559
spotted spidermites so things like danal

1403
00:54:08,239 --> 00:54:12,759
and Brigade which are synthetic

1404
00:54:10,559 --> 00:54:13,920
pyrethroids um will do a good job on

1405
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:15,240
tarnish plant bug but they'll pretty

1406
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:16,680
much clean house and take everything

1407
00:54:15,239 --> 00:54:18,598
else out on the other hand they will

1408
00:54:16,679 --> 00:54:20,399
control two spotted spidermites if they

1409
00:54:18,599 --> 00:54:22,280
happen to be there but they'll also Wipe

1410
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:23,760
Out the Predators for those of you who

1411
00:54:22,280 --> 00:54:26,440
are organic Growers who are looking for

1412
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:28,040
something pyganic is labeled for this uh

1413
00:54:26,440 --> 00:54:29,920
it has zero days to harvest that's what

1414
00:54:28,039 --> 00:54:33,000
the number in parenthesis is so you can

1415
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:35,159
spray this today and pick tomorrow um

1416
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:37,039
Panic doesn't tend to be as effective as

1417
00:54:35,159 --> 00:54:39,159
the synthetic pyrethroids it tends to

1418
00:54:37,039 --> 00:54:40,960
knock the adults off the plant but they

1419
00:54:39,159 --> 00:54:43,000
uh kind of shake their shake it off and

1420
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:44,639
get back up and feed but it's pretty

1421
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:47,280
much what you've got at this point for

1422
00:54:44,639 --> 00:54:49,159
tarnish plant buug uh di brome malathion

1423
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:52,400
a couple of organic

1424
00:54:49,159 --> 00:54:54,920
uh not Organo phosphates these are not

1425
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:56,440
cleared for organic use um Maline has

1426
00:54:54,920 --> 00:54:57,760
three days to harvest so you'd want to

1427
00:54:56,440 --> 00:54:58,720
watch that with the day neutrals

1428
00:54:57,760 --> 00:55:00,319
remember because you're probably going

1429
00:54:58,719 --> 00:55:02,039
to have right fruit and yes the smell of

1430
00:55:00,318 --> 00:55:03,798
Maline is probably enough to steer you

1431
00:55:02,039 --> 00:55:07,838
away from it uh if you going to be

1432
00:55:03,798 --> 00:55:09,440
picking very shortly after uh th thinx

1433
00:55:07,838 --> 00:55:10,838
Works fairly well but watch the days to

1434
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:12,880
harvest on it again there's an odor

1435
00:55:10,838 --> 00:55:14,920
issue with that one as well uh and then

1436
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:16,960
finally a sale which is a relatively low

1437
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:19,318
toxicity material this is one of the new

1438
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:21,079
neonicotinoids does a fairly good job on

1439
00:55:19,318 --> 00:55:23,239
this it is somewhat broad spectrum a

1440
00:55:21,079 --> 00:55:25,680
little more uh specific than the danal

1441
00:55:23,239 --> 00:55:27,000
or Brigade um as I said if you're

1442
00:55:25,679 --> 00:55:29,679
looking for a lower lower toxicity

1443
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:32,119
material this may be one to

1444
00:55:29,679 --> 00:55:33,679
try uh as I said earlier watch out for

1445
00:55:32,119 --> 00:55:35,240
your alternate hosts if you've got a lot

1446
00:55:33,679 --> 00:55:36,879
of flowering weeds in your field as you

1447
00:55:35,239 --> 00:55:38,279
see in the first photo here uh you're

1448
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:40,519
going to have issues with tarnish plant

1449
00:55:38,280 --> 00:55:42,559
pone also pay attention to your mowing

1450
00:55:40,519 --> 00:55:44,480
if you're mowing around the fields when

1451
00:55:42,559 --> 00:55:46,000
your strawberries are in flour where do

1452
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:47,519
you think those things are going to go

1453
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,920
uh those weeds that you're mowing

1454
00:55:47,519 --> 00:55:50,440
probably have are harboring a lot of

1455
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:52,480
tarnish plant bugs as well as other

1456
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:53,679
insects uh and if you take that host

1457
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:55,920
away they're going to be bouncing into

1458
00:55:53,679 --> 00:55:57,679
your strawberry so I like to keep things

1459
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:59,200
fairly tightly mowed until the

1460
00:55:57,679 --> 00:56:01,598
strawberries and flour and then I pretty

1461
00:55:59,199 --> 00:56:03,798
much leave them alone uh until the

1462
00:56:01,599 --> 00:56:05,039
season is done uh but if you decide

1463
00:56:03,798 --> 00:56:06,559
you're going to mow the important thing

1464
00:56:05,039 --> 00:56:08,039
is to keep it mowed and keep it mowed

1465
00:56:06,559 --> 00:56:09,798
close so that weeds never have a chance

1466
00:56:08,039 --> 00:56:11,079
to grow up and form flowers that are

1467
00:56:09,798 --> 00:56:11,960
going to be attractive to the tarnish

1468
00:56:11,079 --> 00:56:14,720
plant

1469
00:56:11,960 --> 00:56:16,519
bug row covers can be used if you're

1470
00:56:14,719 --> 00:56:18,798
going to carry these over and try to get

1471
00:56:16,519 --> 00:56:20,639
a spring crop off of them row covers

1472
00:56:18,798 --> 00:56:23,159
work as a barrier to keep the adults

1473
00:56:20,639 --> 00:56:25,879
from laying eggs on there and they also

1474
00:56:23,159 --> 00:56:28,318
Advance the flowering date anywhere from

1475
00:56:25,880 --> 00:56:29,920
a week in two weeks ahead of its normal

1476
00:56:28,318 --> 00:56:32,038
uh time and as a result the tarnish

1477
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:34,159
plant bug over wintering adults may not

1478
00:56:32,039 --> 00:56:35,400
be up and laying eggs at that point I

1479
00:56:34,159 --> 00:56:37,038
don't think these are going to be really

1480
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:38,519
practical for late summer and fall

1481
00:56:37,039 --> 00:56:39,799
applications because if you put these

1482
00:56:38,519 --> 00:56:41,000
over the strawberries at that point

1483
00:56:39,798 --> 00:56:42,119
you're probably going to be interfering

1484
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,679
with pollination you're going to be

1485
00:56:42,119 --> 00:56:45,798
getting it too hot under there for the

1486
00:56:43,679 --> 00:56:47,358
strawberries and also uh there's

1487
00:56:45,798 --> 00:56:49,159
probably bugs already under there and if

1488
00:56:47,358 --> 00:56:50,480
you just put this over instead of acting

1489
00:56:49,159 --> 00:56:53,159
as a barrier it's actually going to be

1490
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:55,199
sitting in there and protecting them um

1491
00:56:53,159 --> 00:56:57,358
so think about this there may be a way

1492
00:56:55,199 --> 00:56:59,239
to make it work uh for the summer and

1493
00:56:57,358 --> 00:57:00,639
fall crop with tarnish plant bug but I

1494
00:56:59,239 --> 00:57:02,479
think this would be more in line if you

1495
00:57:00,639 --> 00:57:04,078
were planning on carrying these over and

1496
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:05,679
taking the spring crop you could put

1497
00:57:04,079 --> 00:57:07,559
these on very early in the spring or

1498
00:57:05,679 --> 00:57:09,078
late in the fall uh and then just keep

1499
00:57:07,559 --> 00:57:10,400
them on and you'll probably find you're

1500
00:57:09,079 --> 00:57:11,318
getting a little bit of management of

1501
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:14,280
tarnish

1502
00:57:11,318 --> 00:57:17,838
plant there are some biological control

1503
00:57:14,280 --> 00:57:19,200
uh uh methods that can be used here the

1504
00:57:17,838 --> 00:57:20,960
import most important thing is that

1505
00:57:19,199 --> 00:57:22,598
there are natural Predators spiders

1506
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:24,960
beetles and things that will eat tarnish

1507
00:57:22,599 --> 00:57:26,960
plant bug NS um and you need to

1508
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:28,720
encourage those by not trying to use a

1509
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:30,559
lot of those broadspectrum insecticides

1510
00:57:28,719 --> 00:57:33,038
that would tend to take them out there

1511
00:57:30,559 --> 00:57:34,240
is a naturally occurring parasitoid uh

1512
00:57:33,039 --> 00:57:36,559
this little wasp that you see in the

1513
00:57:34,239 --> 00:57:38,239
photo here was imported from Europe and

1514
00:57:36,559 --> 00:57:39,880
released in the Northeast and has now

1515
00:57:38,239 --> 00:57:41,919
established itself pretty well and has

1516
00:57:39,880 --> 00:57:43,720
given us some natural suppression of

1517
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:46,838
tarnish plant bug it parasitizes the

1518
00:57:43,719 --> 00:57:50,199
nymphs uh however it by itself hasn't

1519
00:57:46,838 --> 00:57:51,880
given us 100% economic uh control I have

1520
00:57:50,199 --> 00:57:53,679
noticed that in recent years tarish

1521
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:55,559
plant bug population seem to be on the

1522
00:57:53,679 --> 00:57:57,399
decline and I expect this is what it is

1523
00:57:55,559 --> 00:57:59,760
but don't expect this is going to be the

1524
00:57:57,400 --> 00:58:02,240
complete solution to the problem there

1525
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:04,280
is a fungus Bavaria basana that is

1526
00:58:02,239 --> 00:58:05,959
commercially produces microl which is

1527
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:08,000
labeled for tarnish plant bug on

1528
00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:10,760
strawberries various studies with these

1529
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:13,519
have showed anywhere from 40 to 60%

1530
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:15,240
control at best and it really depends on

1531
00:58:13,519 --> 00:58:17,719
what the season is like around it it

1532
00:58:15,239 --> 00:58:21,239
tends to break down very quickly in uh

1533
00:58:17,719 --> 00:58:23,639
hot sunny weather um as part of a

1534
00:58:21,239 --> 00:58:25,679
program of controls uh with other things

1535
00:58:23,639 --> 00:58:27,239
it might work fairly well as of yet I

1536
00:58:25,679 --> 00:58:28,480
don't think think this is Army labeled

1537
00:58:27,239 --> 00:58:30,118
but you might want to check that if

1538
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:32,559
you're

1539
00:58:30,119 --> 00:58:34,160
organic okay let's look at the other

1540
00:58:32,559 --> 00:58:35,920
major one that I wanted to cover today

1541
00:58:34,159 --> 00:58:38,440
and that's two spotted spidermites which

1542
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:40,519
have been a big issue on some of the uh

1543
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:43,039
day neutral production systems here you

1544
00:58:40,519 --> 00:58:45,400
see some adults and some eggs uh on the

1545
00:58:43,039 --> 00:58:47,440
picture on the leand side these feed on

1546
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:49,000
the undersides of the leaves and they

1547
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:51,280
are very small as you can see in the

1548
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:52,719
next photo here I've got one circled you

1549
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:54,359
may or may not be able to see them with

1550
00:58:52,719 --> 00:58:56,279
the naked eye depending on how good your

1551
00:58:54,358 --> 00:58:58,239
eyesight is and how UCR to seeing the so

1552
00:58:56,280 --> 00:59:00,440
you may want to carry a 10x hand lens

1553
00:58:58,239 --> 00:59:01,759
with you and be able to see them but by

1554
00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:03,119
feeding on the undersides of the leaves

1555
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:05,079
they'll cause cause the plants to be

1556
00:59:03,119 --> 00:59:06,960
weakened quite a bit and if they

1557
00:59:05,079 --> 00:59:09,240
populations explode they cause a lot of

1558
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:10,519
webbing and bronzing which can extend

1559
00:59:09,239 --> 00:59:12,358
onto the fruit and make them

1560
00:59:10,519 --> 00:59:14,079
unmarketable but just the fact that the

1561
00:59:12,358 --> 00:59:15,838
plants are so weakened you're probably

1562
00:59:14,079 --> 00:59:18,680
going to see reductions in size and

1563
00:59:15,838 --> 00:59:21,318
quality as a result of these might

1564
00:59:18,679 --> 00:59:22,919
eating these overwinter as adults and

1565
00:59:21,318 --> 00:59:25,038
they tend to be very active when the

1566
00:59:22,920 --> 00:59:26,920
temperatures uh get warm they like it

1567
00:59:25,039 --> 00:59:29,000
hot uh they lay their eggs on the

1568
00:59:26,920 --> 00:59:31,838
undersides of the leaves uh as you saw

1569
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:33,559
in that photo uh and as oops I might see

1570
00:59:31,838 --> 00:59:35,679
my little symbols here Chang those

1571
00:59:33,559 --> 00:59:37,920
upwards arrows as temperatures increase

1572
00:59:35,679 --> 00:59:40,480
and food becomes more available they lay

1573
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:42,200
lots more eggs so when it's hot and your

1574
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:43,240
plants are doing very well especially if

1575
00:59:42,199 --> 00:59:45,358
you've been feeding them lots of

1576
00:59:43,239 --> 00:59:47,919
nitrogen you can expect two spidermites

1577
00:59:45,358 --> 00:59:50,119
can be a problem um and again the

1578
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:51,880
symptoms are bronzing yellowing of the

1579
00:59:50,119 --> 00:59:53,680
leaves you may see some webbing on the

1580
00:59:51,880 --> 00:59:57,160
undersides of leaves and then just pour

1581
00:59:53,679 --> 00:59:58,078
Vigor as well

1582
00:59:57,159 --> 00:59:59,399
so what are we going to do for

1583
00:59:58,079 --> 01:00:00,760
management here here you can see some of

1584
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:03,240
the bronzing on the leaves and some

1585
01:00:00,760 --> 01:00:05,119
webbing this is a greenhouse well first

1586
01:00:03,239 --> 01:00:07,279
of all avoid stress the mites are one of

1587
01:00:05,119 --> 01:00:08,960
these pests that seem to really enjoy

1588
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:10,880
stressed out plants they tend to go to

1589
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:12,280
them first if your plants are drought

1590
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:15,039
stressed you tend to have more problems

1591
01:00:12,280 --> 01:00:17,200
with spider mites uh We've also noticed

1592
01:00:15,039 --> 01:00:19,280
that uh the rows that are near the dirt

1593
01:00:17,199 --> 01:00:21,199
road where they get a lot of dust uh

1594
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:22,519
this seems to braid the the leaves a

1595
01:00:21,199 --> 01:00:24,879
little bit and make them even more

1596
01:00:22,519 --> 01:00:26,759
attractive to mites I've noticed that in

1597
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:29,480
some fields in California and Florida

1598
01:00:26,760 --> 01:00:31,799
now they actually put up uh uh barriers

1599
01:00:29,480 --> 01:00:34,199
along their their Farm roads to keep

1600
01:00:31,798 --> 01:00:37,119
dust from the vehicles P from going onto

1601
01:00:34,199 --> 01:00:38,719
those just basically form breakes there

1602
01:00:37,119 --> 01:00:40,640
excessive nitrogen if you're putting too

1603
01:00:38,719 --> 01:00:42,639
much nitrogen on them you get big Lush

1604
01:00:40,639 --> 01:00:44,118
pedals that are covering up your fruit

1605
01:00:42,639 --> 01:00:45,759
this tends to make them more attractive

1606
01:00:44,119 --> 01:00:46,920
to mites but also is going to cause

1607
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:48,240
problems with petritis because you're

1608
01:00:46,920 --> 01:00:51,159
not getting the air movement through

1609
01:00:48,239 --> 01:00:52,959
there uh as Frank talked about earlier

1610
01:00:51,159 --> 01:00:54,879
using row covers on your plants although

1611
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:56,960
it may be a strategy for tarnished plant

1612
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:58,559
bug in some situations it actually will

1613
01:00:56,960 --> 01:01:00,159
increase your risk of mites because

1614
01:00:58,559 --> 01:01:01,880
you're creating a beautiful warm

1615
01:01:00,159 --> 01:01:03,598
Greenhouse likee environment under there

1616
01:01:01,880 --> 01:01:05,240
that the mites are really going to like

1617
01:01:03,599 --> 01:01:07,160
so if you're using row covers make sure

1618
01:01:05,239 --> 01:01:08,798
you pick them up uh fairly regularly and

1619
01:01:07,159 --> 01:01:10,000
take some leaves out and take a look for

1620
01:01:08,798 --> 01:01:12,358
mites just to make sure they're not

1621
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:14,239
building up in there want to encourage

1622
01:01:12,358 --> 01:01:16,679
the Predators by avoiding broadspectrum

1623
01:01:14,239 --> 01:01:18,558
insecticides as we've talked about and

1624
01:01:16,679 --> 01:01:22,519
there is the possibility of releasing uh

1625
01:01:18,559 --> 01:01:24,519
predators in this case uh Ulus Fus is

1626
01:01:22,519 --> 01:01:26,440
another M species but this is a predator

1627
01:01:24,519 --> 01:01:29,199
M that happily feeds on the eggs and

1628
01:01:26,440 --> 01:01:30,639
larv of two spotted spider mites and you

1629
01:01:29,199 --> 01:01:32,439
can release these you can buy them

1630
01:01:30,639 --> 01:01:34,199
commercially and release them the trick

1631
01:01:32,440 --> 01:01:35,880
to using them however is to make sure

1632
01:01:34,199 --> 01:01:37,639
that you have a population of two-

1633
01:01:35,880 --> 01:01:39,640
spotted spidermites on your plants

1634
01:01:37,639 --> 01:01:41,598
before you do a release because once you

1635
01:01:39,639 --> 01:01:43,038
release these they need something to eat

1636
01:01:41,599 --> 01:01:44,760
and if you release them onto a nice

1637
01:01:43,039 --> 01:01:46,680
clean field they will die out very

1638
01:01:44,760 --> 01:01:48,440
quickly so I like to say you know make

1639
01:01:46,679 --> 01:01:50,078
sure that you're at threshold Before You

1640
01:01:48,440 --> 01:01:51,519
Do release and don't expect immediate

1641
01:01:50,079 --> 01:01:53,839
gratification it takes a while for these

1642
01:01:51,519 --> 01:01:56,239
to get established to give you good

1643
01:01:53,838 --> 01:01:58,038
control when we monitor for spotted

1644
01:01:56,239 --> 01:02:00,558
spidermites we simply Harvest leaves

1645
01:01:58,039 --> 01:02:02,920
from the field uh and don't all

1646
01:02:00,559 --> 01:02:05,480
concentrate in one part of the field uh

1647
01:02:02,920 --> 01:02:07,278
I like to take 60 leaves from old leaves

1648
01:02:05,480 --> 01:02:08,960
young leaves from each edge of the field

1649
01:02:07,278 --> 01:02:10,318
in the middle of the field and then I

1650
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:12,000
just sit down at the edge of the field

1651
01:02:10,318 --> 01:02:14,400
and I start looking at the unders sides

1652
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:16,079
of those leaves um and again you don't

1653
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:17,480
have to count mites that's the good news

1654
01:02:16,079 --> 01:02:19,440
just look and see if there are any mites

1655
01:02:17,480 --> 01:02:21,440
at all on the underside of that leaf and

1656
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:24,000
if there is you count that as a hit and

1657
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:26,200
if 15 leaves out of the 60 you took or

1658
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:28,278
25% of the leaves that you took have any

1659
01:02:26,199 --> 01:02:30,038
mites on them at all it's time to do

1660
01:02:28,278 --> 01:02:32,239
something uh and this may be an

1661
01:02:30,039 --> 01:02:33,680
insecticide it may be doing a Predator

1662
01:02:32,239 --> 01:02:36,000
release

1663
01:02:33,679 --> 01:02:38,038
whatever now there are some pretty good

1664
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:40,239
options here for uh controlling two-

1665
01:02:38,039 --> 01:02:41,520
spotted spider mites you can use oils

1666
01:02:40,239 --> 01:02:42,759
only in the springtime this isn't

1667
01:02:41,519 --> 01:02:44,159
something you want to use in the summer

1668
01:02:42,760 --> 01:02:46,000
but when the new foliage starts to

1669
01:02:44,159 --> 01:02:48,358
emerge in the springtime a spray of

1670
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:50,119
sunspray or stylid oil uh with a mist

1671
01:02:48,358 --> 01:02:51,519
blower so you're getting the undersides

1672
01:02:50,119 --> 01:02:53,039
those leaves and getting good coverage

1673
01:02:51,519 --> 01:02:55,079
can actually offer pretty good control

1674
01:02:53,039 --> 01:02:56,760
of mites uh and actually isn't too

1675
01:02:55,079 --> 01:02:59,640
harmful to predators and these are

1676
01:02:56,760 --> 01:03:01,160
cleared for organic use um just looking

1677
01:02:59,639 --> 01:03:03,318
at this photo here you can just see the

1678
01:03:01,159 --> 01:03:04,838
little bit of yellowing start to show on

1679
01:03:03,318 --> 01:03:08,038
there that's a good indication that MIT

1680
01:03:04,838 --> 01:03:12,159
are starting to get active there Keane

1681
01:03:08,039 --> 01:03:13,599
agac or abamectin Savvy vendex agon all

1682
01:03:12,159 --> 01:03:15,118
of these are pretty good products you

1683
01:03:13,599 --> 01:03:17,079
want to watch your days to harvest if

1684
01:03:15,119 --> 01:03:19,599
you're getting near picking time again

1685
01:03:17,079 --> 01:03:22,640
you might want to watch odor um you

1686
01:03:19,599 --> 01:03:24,559
might want watch odor problems and uh

1687
01:03:22,639 --> 01:03:26,679
you might want to watch um effects on

1688
01:03:24,559 --> 01:03:28,720
Predators if you're using predat

1689
01:03:26,679 --> 01:03:30,078
finally if you notice that one side of

1690
01:03:28,719 --> 01:03:31,719
the field seems to be showing more

1691
01:03:30,079 --> 01:03:33,599
damage than others or just getting

1692
01:03:31,719 --> 01:03:36,159
started in one place spot treatments can

1693
01:03:33,599 --> 01:03:39,119
be effective if you're using predatory

1694
01:03:36,159 --> 01:03:41,278
mites uh 5 to 10,000 mites per acre is

1695
01:03:39,119 --> 01:03:42,920
what we would recommend and when you get

1696
01:03:41,278 --> 01:03:45,559
mites from your dealer make sure you

1697
01:03:42,920 --> 01:03:47,079
open up the the uh uh little jar they

1698
01:03:45,559 --> 01:03:48,920
come in and take a hand lens to it make

1699
01:03:47,079 --> 01:03:53,640
sure those mites are alive we've had

1700
01:03:48,920 --> 01:03:56,639
several incidents of uh mites um

1701
01:03:53,639 --> 01:03:58,038
arriving from your uh dealer without

1702
01:03:56,639 --> 01:03:59,358
good success and I think this is just

1703
01:03:58,039 --> 01:04:01,520
because you know sometimes they get too

1704
01:03:59,358 --> 01:04:03,838
hot in

1705
01:04:01,519 --> 01:04:05,759
storage uh someone says my mic isn't

1706
01:04:03,838 --> 01:04:09,719
working I'll try to turn it up

1707
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:09,720
here see if that does any

1708
01:04:12,278 --> 01:04:15,639
good all right and we'll finish up with

1709
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:18,358
a couple of things that have shown up in

1710
01:04:15,639 --> 01:04:21,038
a few Fields um but haven't been uh a

1711
01:04:18,358 --> 01:04:22,679
huge problem for everybody uh thrips

1712
01:04:21,039 --> 01:04:24,319
usually Eastern flower thrips in the

1713
01:04:22,679 --> 01:04:26,838
West Coast Area this might be Western

1714
01:04:24,318 --> 01:04:28,679
Flower thrip uh has has been a problem

1715
01:04:26,838 --> 01:04:30,318
in some Fields these again are very

1716
01:04:28,679 --> 01:04:32,519
small almost as small as those two

1717
01:04:30,318 --> 01:04:34,000
spotted spidermites uh the blue arrow

1718
01:04:32,519 --> 01:04:35,440
here points to one it's not a very good

1719
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,798
photo but it does give you an idea of

1720
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:38,119
the size of these if we compare it to

1721
01:04:36,798 --> 01:04:40,480
the strawberry flower that it's sitting

1722
01:04:38,119 --> 01:04:42,440
on and then the damage is on the right

1723
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:44,079
and what they do is they cause bronzing

1724
01:04:42,440 --> 01:04:45,920
because they feed on that developing

1725
01:04:44,079 --> 01:04:48,278
flow or that developing flow as it's

1726
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:50,400
going turning into a strawberry fruit

1727
01:04:48,278 --> 01:04:52,480
and that bronzing causes the epidermal

1728
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:55,720
or the skin layer of it to become

1729
01:04:52,480 --> 01:04:58,639
relatively uh unable to expand and thus

1730
01:04:55,719 --> 01:05:00,000
we get a lot of cracking with that um

1731
01:04:58,639 --> 01:05:01,558
trips are one of those things they show

1732
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:03,039
up in some Fields they don't show up in

1733
01:05:01,559 --> 01:05:04,559
others they see them some years we don't

1734
01:05:03,039 --> 01:05:06,559
see them in others we expect this

1735
01:05:04,559 --> 01:05:08,920
because Eastern flower thrip doesn't

1736
01:05:06,559 --> 01:05:11,680
tend to overwinter in the more Northern

1737
01:05:08,920 --> 01:05:14,358
locations of the US so it has to fly up

1738
01:05:11,679 --> 01:05:16,078
or be blown up in in storm fronts every

1739
01:05:14,358 --> 01:05:17,400
year and as a result of that you may not

1740
01:05:16,079 --> 01:05:20,400
get the populations that are going to

1741
01:05:17,400 --> 01:05:23,358
cause you economic harm every

1742
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:24,960
year um with thrifts we need to start

1743
01:05:23,358 --> 01:05:27,000
scouting and early fruit development

1744
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:28,559
about the time of petal fall when those

1745
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:30,039
petals are just falling off the flowers

1746
01:05:28,559 --> 01:05:32,400
you've got fruit that's say a quarter to

1747
01:05:30,039 --> 01:05:35,319
a half inch in diameter typically what

1748
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:38,720
we recommend is to sample 50 fruit um

1749
01:05:35,318 --> 01:05:40,719
and just examine those uh for mites I'm

1750
01:05:38,719 --> 01:05:42,519
sorry for for thrips it's not always

1751
01:05:40,719 --> 01:05:44,078
easy to see them so one trick is to

1752
01:05:42,519 --> 01:05:45,960
place those fruit in a little baggie a

1753
01:05:44,079 --> 01:05:48,960
Ziploc bag and then put it in the sun

1754
01:05:45,960 --> 01:05:50,519
for about 10 15 minutes and then those

1755
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:51,760
uh THS will go running off the fruit

1756
01:05:50,519 --> 01:05:53,038
because they're getting too hot and then

1757
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:55,319
you can look at them with the handls and

1758
01:05:53,039 --> 01:05:57,599
start counting your threshold and this

1759
01:05:55,318 --> 01:06:00,159
is B based on some work done in Canada

1760
01:05:57,599 --> 01:06:01,880
uh in a pick your own field about 25 FPS

1761
01:06:00,159 --> 01:06:04,519
for those 50 fruits that you put in a

1762
01:06:01,880 --> 01:06:07,960
bag or you know

1763
01:06:04,519 --> 01:06:09,599
um that should work pretty well uh if

1764
01:06:07,960 --> 01:06:11,079
you're shipping the thrip tolerance is

1765
01:06:09,599 --> 01:06:13,200
quite a bit less than that you probably

1766
01:06:11,079 --> 01:06:15,160
want to look at two thrips for Berry and

1767
01:06:13,199 --> 01:06:16,598
that uh five thrips for 50 fruit excuse

1768
01:06:15,159 --> 01:06:19,038
me and then two thrips per Berry

1769
01:06:16,599 --> 01:06:21,960
according to research in Canada is going

1770
01:06:19,039 --> 01:06:26,119
to uh result in about 20%

1771
01:06:21,960 --> 01:06:29,318
injury as far as pesticides go um what

1772
01:06:26,119 --> 01:06:31,039
we're looking at here is a fairly good

1773
01:06:29,318 --> 01:06:33,000
selection of pesticides now especially

1774
01:06:31,039 --> 01:06:36,640
with the new Spinosa type spinor and

1775
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:39,159
Trust radiant are all use uh in trust is

1776
01:06:36,639 --> 01:06:40,639
cleared for use for organic Growers and

1777
01:06:39,159 --> 01:06:42,078
does offer pretty good control these

1778
01:06:40,639 --> 01:06:44,598
also have zero days to harvest so

1779
01:06:42,079 --> 01:06:45,920
there's no effect that way then di brome

1780
01:06:44,599 --> 01:06:47,480
uh we've talked about that for control

1781
01:06:45,920 --> 01:06:49,838
of other things this is fairly hot and

1782
01:06:47,480 --> 01:06:51,599
will take out most of your predators and

1783
01:06:49,838 --> 01:06:54,078
then finally a sale which is a

1784
01:06:51,599 --> 01:06:57,519
neonicotinoid as I said relatively low

1785
01:06:54,079 --> 01:06:57,519
toxicity in this particular case

1786
01:06:58,239 --> 01:07:02,919
Cas um and just to finish up with a

1787
01:07:00,440 --> 01:07:04,838
couple things that maybe show up uh for

1788
01:07:02,920 --> 01:07:06,639
you sat beetles or picnic beetles these

1789
01:07:04,838 --> 01:07:08,880
are small beetles that will chew holes

1790
01:07:06,639 --> 01:07:10,400
in the sides of bright fruit you can see

1791
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:11,760
the damage a small Beetle here there

1792
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:13,639
actually several species of this

1793
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:15,839
particular insect and we'll chew holes

1794
01:07:13,639 --> 01:07:18,920
in the sides here as you

1795
01:07:15,838 --> 01:07:20,759
see um the way around sap beetles is to

1796
01:07:18,920 --> 01:07:24,400
harvest regularly these these insects

1797
01:07:20,760 --> 01:07:25,720
key in on uh overripe fruit so make sure

1798
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:27,039
your Pickers are not just pick picking

1799
01:07:25,719 --> 01:07:28,598
the fruit that are going to Market but

1800
01:07:27,039 --> 01:07:30,278
removing any overwrite fruit from the

1801
01:07:28,599 --> 01:07:32,960
field or rotten fruit from the field as

1802
01:07:30,278 --> 01:07:34,400
well uh some people have used traps of

1803
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:36,079
rotten fruit on the edge of the field to

1804
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:38,400
try to draw The Beetles out and into

1805
01:07:36,079 --> 01:07:40,000
those uh piles of crap fruit and then

1806
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:42,599
they can either treat that or just get

1807
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:44,239
rid of it the thing with insecticides

1808
01:07:42,599 --> 01:07:45,798
here is you're going to be going after

1809
01:07:44,239 --> 01:07:47,399
fruit that's fairly ripe so you really

1810
01:07:45,798 --> 01:07:50,838
need to watch your days to harvest for

1811
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:53,639
these uh Brigade danl uh will work

1812
01:07:50,838 --> 01:07:55,159
fairly well but again uh you're using a

1813
01:07:53,639 --> 01:07:57,400
fairly hot insecticide here that's going

1814
01:07:55,159 --> 01:08:00,078
to hurt your Predators Panic is cleared

1815
01:07:57,400 --> 01:08:01,960
for organic Growers uh and then finally

1816
01:08:00,079 --> 01:08:04,039
a sale which is again that new ni

1817
01:08:01,960 --> 01:08:06,519
neonicotinoid with relatively low

1818
01:08:04,039 --> 01:08:08,079
toxicity in one day to harvest and some

1819
01:08:06,519 --> 01:08:09,199
recent research coming out of Florida

1820
01:08:08,079 --> 01:08:11,000
and some other areas has shown they've

1821
01:08:09,199 --> 01:08:12,679
got very good results with this

1822
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:15,599
particular uh

1823
01:08:12,679 --> 01:08:17,559
insect I see a question on the oils for

1824
01:08:15,599 --> 01:08:18,960
burning leaves that's why we use it in

1825
01:08:17,560 --> 01:08:20,480
the springtime you don't want to use the

1826
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:22,039
oils during the summertime or you will

1827
01:08:20,479 --> 01:08:24,759
get burning you want to use it early in

1828
01:08:22,039 --> 01:08:27,519
the spring um as far as the sequence of

1829
01:08:24,759 --> 01:08:29,399
mitas siiz to delay might resistance I

1830
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:31,000
wouldn't say there's a specific sequence

1831
01:08:29,399 --> 01:08:32,960
here what I would be more inclined to do

1832
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:34,359
is shake up the chemistry as you're

1833
01:08:32,960 --> 01:08:37,520
going through in other words you might

1834
01:08:34,359 --> 01:08:39,640
want to use uh something that's um

1835
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:41,679
relatively specific like a vendex for

1836
01:08:39,640 --> 01:08:44,798
example and then move over to something

1837
01:08:41,679 --> 01:08:48,838
with a different chemistry like omite or

1838
01:08:44,798 --> 01:08:50,679
Savvy um and uh frankly one of the best

1839
01:08:48,838 --> 01:08:53,318
best MDES out there is three days of

1840
01:08:50,679 --> 01:08:55,480
cold and Rain um unfortunately that

1841
01:08:53,319 --> 01:08:58,039
won't do much for your metritis uh

1842
01:08:55,479 --> 01:08:59,798
control measures uh but uh uh mites are

1843
01:08:58,039 --> 01:09:02,079
actually very susceptible to just having

1844
01:08:59,798 --> 01:09:03,439
good moisture the real trick with MDES

1845
01:09:02,079 --> 01:09:04,880
again is making sure you have good

1846
01:09:03,439 --> 01:09:06,639
coverage and that your sprayer is

1847
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:09,480
getting the undersides of those

1848
01:09:06,640 --> 01:09:11,119
leaves um the threshold of five spider

1849
01:09:09,479 --> 01:09:13,399
mites per Leaf I don't like uh that

1850
01:09:11,119 --> 01:09:15,640
makes me count mites uh so I prefer to

1851
01:09:13,399 --> 01:09:17,238
go with 25% of leaves infested so I

1852
01:09:15,640 --> 01:09:19,880
don't count mites I just flip the leaves

1853
01:09:17,238 --> 01:09:21,759
over and look at them um and if there's

1854
01:09:19,880 --> 01:09:23,798
one M or 20 mites it doesn't matter I

1855
01:09:21,759 --> 01:09:26,119
count that leaf as infested and then if

1856
01:09:23,798 --> 01:09:29,439
25% of the total sample of leaves are

1857
01:09:26,119 --> 01:09:31,439
infested that's the time you should be

1858
01:09:29,439 --> 01:09:34,960
spraying all right let's finish up with

1859
01:09:31,439 --> 01:09:37,759
potato Leaf Hopper uh this is one that

1860
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:39,279
um can be a problem in some areas in

1861
01:09:37,759 --> 01:09:41,679
some years similar to what we talked

1862
01:09:39,279 --> 01:09:43,319
about with thips uh it tends to like to

1863
01:09:41,679 --> 01:09:44,880
move on to new plants which is why we

1864
01:09:43,319 --> 01:09:47,600
tend to see it be a problem on some

1865
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:48,798
plantings of uh day neutral strawberries

1866
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:50,279
and what we see with this particular

1867
01:09:48,798 --> 01:09:52,679
insect is what we call Hopper burn you

1868
01:09:50,279 --> 01:09:55,440
see the Twisted growth the yellowing on

1869
01:09:52,679 --> 01:09:57,039
the edges of the leaves here um these

1870
01:09:55,439 --> 01:09:58,639
insects feed on the unders sides of the

1871
01:09:57,039 --> 01:10:01,238
leaves and at the same time they're

1872
01:09:58,640 --> 01:10:03,400
feeding they inject toxins uh into that

1873
01:10:01,238 --> 01:10:05,359
leaf which causes this distorted growth

1874
01:10:03,399 --> 01:10:07,559
and generally weakens the plants quite a

1875
01:10:05,359 --> 01:10:09,279
bit um because they're under the

1876
01:10:07,560 --> 01:10:11,120
undersides of leaves similar to two

1877
01:10:09,279 --> 01:10:13,359
spotted spidermites we need to get

1878
01:10:11,119 --> 01:10:15,000
really good coverage of the foliage uh

1879
01:10:13,359 --> 01:10:18,719
in order to make sure that this is going

1880
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:20,319
to work um scouting wise basically all I

1881
01:10:18,719 --> 01:10:22,560
do is start looking for this injury this

1882
01:10:20,319 --> 01:10:24,479
injury is often mistaken for herbicide

1883
01:10:22,560 --> 01:10:26,159
injury people say oh I put too much duel

1884
01:10:24,479 --> 01:10:28,158
down or oh I put too much something else

1885
01:10:26,158 --> 01:10:30,879
down um and when in fact what they've

1886
01:10:28,158 --> 01:10:32,639
got is uh uh these Hoppers really what

1887
01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:34,560
you need to do is just brush the leaves

1888
01:10:32,640 --> 01:10:37,119
with your hands you'll see a bunch of

1889
01:10:34,560 --> 01:10:38,560
little white uh Hoppers flly out or you

1890
01:10:37,119 --> 01:10:40,640
can look at the undersides and look for

1891
01:10:38,560 --> 01:10:43,120
those Nims that we saw in the previous

1892
01:10:40,640 --> 01:10:44,119
slide you need good coverage as I said

1893
01:10:43,119 --> 01:10:46,158
again there are some pretty good

1894
01:10:44,119 --> 01:10:47,559
materials cleared for this malathion

1895
01:10:46,158 --> 01:10:49,439
again watch your days to harvest and

1896
01:10:47,560 --> 01:10:51,000
odor seven again you need to watch your

1897
01:10:49,439 --> 01:10:52,079
days to harvest on that one not

1898
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,960
something to use if you're going to be

1899
01:10:52,079 --> 01:10:56,238
picking right away and then finally

1900
01:10:53,960 --> 01:10:58,560
provado and a sale to neonicotinoids

1901
01:10:56,238 --> 01:11:00,718
with one day to harvest relatively low

1902
01:10:58,560 --> 01:11:04,080
toxicity uh and probably the best

1903
01:11:00,719 --> 01:11:04,079
products for this particular

1904
01:11:05,079 --> 01:11:08,760
situation uh spittlebug can become an

1905
01:11:07,319 --> 01:11:10,599
issue especially if you've got a weedy

1906
01:11:08,760 --> 01:11:12,560
field or lots of clover around the place

1907
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:14,320
it's going to attract these things in

1908
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:15,719
this actually isn't an economic problem

1909
01:11:14,319 --> 01:11:17,079
it's more a problem for your Pickers and

1910
01:11:15,719 --> 01:11:18,800
it depends on how you're running your

1911
01:11:17,079 --> 01:11:20,198
operation here in New England we have

1912
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:22,079
some Growers who are actually using day

1913
01:11:20,198 --> 01:11:23,238
neutrals of pick your own and the

1914
01:11:22,079 --> 01:11:25,479
pickers are really not going to like

1915
01:11:23,238 --> 01:11:27,399
spittle masses in amongst the fruit and

1916
01:11:25,479 --> 01:11:28,799
their hands get covered with this stuff

1917
01:11:27,399 --> 01:11:30,158
uh commercially again your Pickers

1918
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:32,320
aren't going to be very happy but you

1919
01:11:30,158 --> 01:11:34,079
may be able to work around it these are

1920
01:11:32,319 --> 01:11:35,759
just little insects with piercing

1921
01:11:34,079 --> 01:11:39,279
sucking mouth parts and when they're

1922
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:41,760
feeding they uh uh exude this foam

1923
01:11:39,279 --> 01:11:44,319
around them to protect themselves uh and

1924
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:46,760
it makes it very unpleasant to harvest

1925
01:11:44,319 --> 01:11:48,359
um generally we consider one spittle

1926
01:11:46,760 --> 01:11:50,000
mass per foot to be an economic

1927
01:11:48,359 --> 01:11:51,920
threshold your tolerance may actually be

1928
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:53,760
less than that again you need really

1929
01:11:51,920 --> 01:11:56,880
good coverage with your insecticides for

1930
01:11:53,760 --> 01:11:58,440
this uh Brigade alione will do a pretty

1931
01:11:56,880 --> 01:12:00,440
good job but again look at that label

1932
01:11:58,439 --> 01:12:02,238
for pado in a sale where you've got a

1933
01:12:00,439 --> 01:12:03,519
relatively low toxicity and hopefully

1934
01:12:02,238 --> 01:12:05,559
you're only going to have to be applying

1935
01:12:03,520 --> 01:12:07,000
these materials once so we don't have to

1936
01:12:05,560 --> 01:12:09,120
worry about going on and on again and

1937
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:10,479
building resistance uh but if we were

1938
01:12:09,119 --> 01:12:13,198
concerned about that you might want to

1939
01:12:10,479 --> 01:12:17,599
switch to banic for a spray uh or go to

1940
01:12:13,198 --> 01:12:17,599
one of the more specific ones um like

1941
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:22,760
danal um white grubs I don't expect

1942
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:24,800
white grubs to be a huge problem unless

1943
01:12:22,760 --> 01:12:26,679
you're going into fields that have uh

1944
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:28,079
previous been sawed if you're using

1945
01:12:26,679 --> 01:12:29,600
cover crops that can come a lot of

1946
01:12:28,079 --> 01:12:31,439
grasses or you're going into land that

1947
01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:33,239
you've had in hay for a while and you

1948
01:12:31,439 --> 01:12:34,799
turn this land over and then plant your

1949
01:12:33,238 --> 01:12:36,879
day neutrals into it you may start

1950
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:38,920
seeing some plants going down because of

1951
01:12:36,880 --> 01:12:40,920
white grubs feeding on the roots these

1952
01:12:38,920 --> 01:12:43,158
are the larv of Japanese beetles Rose

1953
01:12:40,920 --> 01:12:45,600
chafers and various other species that

1954
01:12:43,158 --> 01:12:47,319
feed on the roots of these plants the

1955
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:48,600
plants will just Wilt and collapse if

1956
01:12:47,319 --> 01:12:49,920
you pull them up to look at the roots

1957
01:12:48,600 --> 01:12:51,719
you'll discover that you don't have any

1958
01:12:49,920 --> 01:12:53,158
Roots uh those plants will be those

1959
01:12:51,719 --> 01:12:55,399
roots will be cut off about a/ inch

1960
01:12:53,158 --> 01:12:58,319
below the soil um as I said it's

1961
01:12:55,399 --> 01:13:00,119
commonly a Turf Pest and uh it's one

1962
01:12:58,319 --> 01:13:02,238
that really if you're doing a good job

1963
01:13:00,119 --> 01:13:04,158
of managing your cover crops and

1964
01:13:02,238 --> 01:13:05,839
avoiding having lots of grass species in

1965
01:13:04,158 --> 01:13:07,399
there if you know you've got uh rub

1966
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:09,679
problems and some of these june beetles

1967
01:13:07,399 --> 01:13:11,000
or Japanese beetle problems around keep

1968
01:13:09,679 --> 01:13:14,158
an eye on

1969
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:16,399
that um don't plant plant into freshly

1970
01:13:14,158 --> 01:13:18,799
turned sods rotate out of any host

1971
01:13:16,399 --> 01:13:21,000
plants for two years I don't recommend

1972
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:22,400
the billus papul milk milky spore at

1973
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:24,600
least here in the Northeast it hasn't

1974
01:13:22,399 --> 01:13:25,799
proven to be very effective but now we

1975
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:28,199
do have

1976
01:13:25,800 --> 01:13:30,320
uh some of the uh newer insecticide

1977
01:13:28,198 --> 01:13:32,439
chemistry it registered for this admire

1978
01:13:30,319 --> 01:13:34,799
is registered should be applied as a

1979
01:13:32,439 --> 01:13:36,238
soil uh application when we're going to

1980
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:37,440
get rain or you can irrigate it in to

1981
01:13:36,238 --> 01:13:38,879
get it down to those grubs and it will

1982
01:13:37,439 --> 01:13:40,559
do a fairly good job but this is

1983
01:13:38,880 --> 01:13:42,400
something that uh probably should be

1984
01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:45,039
done right after planting if you expect

1985
01:13:42,399 --> 01:13:47,519
you're going to have a

1986
01:13:45,039 --> 01:13:50,039
problem uh cycl and might uh we've had

1987
01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:52,639
this as an issue on some uh strawberry

1988
01:13:50,039 --> 01:13:54,439
plants in the short day category I

1989
01:13:52,639 --> 01:13:56,199
wouldn't expect it to be a huge problem

1990
01:13:54,439 --> 01:13:57,839
on day unless you're going to carry

1991
01:13:56,198 --> 01:13:59,599
those over again to get the spring crop

1992
01:13:57,840 --> 01:14:01,319
on them these usually come in on Nursery

1993
01:13:59,600 --> 01:14:03,000
stock but they take one or two years to

1994
01:14:01,319 --> 01:14:04,479
get established and start seeing the

1995
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:06,520
injury that you see in this photo here

1996
01:14:04,479 --> 01:14:08,359
where the leaves are very small curved

1997
01:14:06,520 --> 01:14:10,840
and the plants tend to be very unthrifty

1998
01:14:08,359 --> 01:14:12,799
and and yield hardly any fruit these

1999
01:14:10,840 --> 01:14:14,800
mites are very small you need at least a

2000
01:14:12,800 --> 01:14:16,760
20x hand lens to see them it's better to

2001
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:18,520
get them under a dissecting scope and

2002
01:14:16,760 --> 01:14:21,119
they reside see if my arrows going to

2003
01:14:18,520 --> 01:14:24,520
work here they reside down in the crown

2004
01:14:21,119 --> 01:14:25,880
of the plant um so you can't just look

2005
01:14:24,520 --> 01:14:27,679
at the leaves you got to pull this plant

2006
01:14:25,880 --> 01:14:29,600
apart take some unfolded leaves from

2007
01:14:27,679 --> 01:14:32,639
down in the crown and get them under the

2008
01:14:29,600 --> 01:14:34,120
scope MDES will work on this the biggest

2009
01:14:32,639 --> 01:14:35,639
problem is getting it down to where it

2010
01:14:34,119 --> 01:14:37,519
needs to be and that means you have to

2011
01:14:35,639 --> 01:14:38,840
drench this product to make sure that

2012
01:14:37,520 --> 01:14:40,480
you're going to that product is going to

2013
01:14:38,840 --> 01:14:43,440
be carried down so it may be applying it

2014
01:14:40,479 --> 01:14:45,599
putting on some irrigation afterwards um

2015
01:14:43,439 --> 01:14:47,198
these can be difficult to control uh

2016
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:48,719
there's not a lot of insecticides out

2017
01:14:47,198 --> 01:14:51,759
there that will do a real good job on

2018
01:14:48,719 --> 01:14:55,439
them uh right now all that's cleared is

2019
01:14:51,760 --> 01:14:57,679
thonex and uh see

2020
01:14:55,439 --> 01:14:59,079
uh thinx Keane again watch your odor

2021
01:14:57,679 --> 01:15:00,279
issues with calan and you've got three

2022
01:14:59,079 --> 01:15:02,439
days to harvest on that and a new

2023
01:15:00,279 --> 01:15:03,880
product called portal uh Jim Price down

2024
01:15:02,439 --> 01:15:06,158
Florida's done some work on this one

2025
01:15:03,880 --> 01:15:08,000
I've been very pleased with it uh for

2026
01:15:06,158 --> 01:15:09,879
cyclonite if you suspect you have

2027
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:11,920
cyclonite I would strongly recommend you

2028
01:15:09,880 --> 01:15:13,319
call your county extension or your your

2029
01:15:11,920 --> 01:15:15,239
small fruit specialist to come out and

2030
01:15:13,319 --> 01:15:16,880
have a look at it make sure it's not

2031
01:15:15,238 --> 01:15:18,479
that there isn't something else going on

2032
01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:19,760
out there uh because it is one that

2033
01:15:18,479 --> 01:15:22,718
would be a little unusual on the day

2034
01:15:19,760 --> 01:15:25,039
neutrals but certainly not possible to

2035
01:15:22,719 --> 01:15:26,359
happen um cliffer Beetle like I see

2036
01:15:25,039 --> 01:15:28,198
we're running short on time so I don't

2037
01:15:26,359 --> 01:15:29,799
want to push things here I don't expect

2038
01:15:28,198 --> 01:15:31,638
Clipper would be a problem for you on

2039
01:15:29,800 --> 01:15:33,840
day neutrals except again if you're

2040
01:15:31,639 --> 01:15:35,800
going to carry these plants over and try

2041
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:37,480
to get a spring crop if you're going for

2042
01:15:35,800 --> 01:15:39,440
the spring crop then Clipper could be an

2043
01:15:37,479 --> 01:15:41,198
issue for you in the spring going

2044
01:15:39,439 --> 01:15:42,678
through and clipping the flower buds off

2045
01:15:41,198 --> 01:15:44,719
as you see in this picture here just

2046
01:15:42,679 --> 01:15:47,440
behind the open flower of Bud clipped

2047
01:15:44,719 --> 01:15:49,439
off um by rotating your plantings

2048
01:15:47,439 --> 01:15:51,279
removing alternate host such as wild

2049
01:15:49,439 --> 01:15:53,599
strawberries and brambles around and

2050
01:15:51,279 --> 01:15:55,599
then uh pre-bloom insecticides can give

2051
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:56,920
you good control of this if those

2052
01:15:55,600 --> 01:15:58,400
flowers start opening in the spring you

2053
01:15:56,920 --> 01:16:00,158
see little holes in the petals like you

2054
01:15:58,399 --> 01:16:02,479
see here that's an indication that these

2055
01:16:00,158 --> 01:16:04,638
bugs are active uh here's a Clipper on a

2056
01:16:02,479 --> 01:16:06,119
flower Bud uh starting to feed after

2057
01:16:04,639 --> 01:16:07,719
they fed on the pollen for a while and

2058
01:16:06,119 --> 01:16:10,119
gotten fat and happy they'll go down and

2059
01:16:07,719 --> 01:16:11,800
start clipping Buds and here see if my

2060
01:16:10,119 --> 01:16:14,479
circle comes in here you can see a clip

2061
01:16:11,800 --> 01:16:16,279
bud just clip below it we Scout for this

2062
01:16:14,479 --> 01:16:17,919
by scouting by looking at all the plants

2063
01:16:16,279 --> 01:16:20,000
in a twoot area you can see this twoot

2064
01:16:17,920 --> 01:16:22,319
Frame we have and five locations of the

2065
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:25,639
field we count all the clip buds in that

2066
01:16:22,319 --> 01:16:29,479
little frame and what we see is that if

2067
01:16:25,639 --> 01:16:31,480
more than one bud per sampling site is

2068
01:16:29,479 --> 01:16:33,519
clipped we would generally recommend

2069
01:16:31,479 --> 01:16:35,000
control however if you notice that this

2070
01:16:33,520 --> 01:16:36,239
is coming in on one side of the field

2071
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:37,880
and usually it's the side of the field

2072
01:16:36,238 --> 01:16:40,039
that has a lot of brambles or Woods

2073
01:16:37,880 --> 01:16:42,400
associated with it you can just spray

2074
01:16:40,039 --> 01:16:43,960
the six rows in from there and you'll

2075
01:16:42,399 --> 01:16:46,679
probably find you're getting pretty good

2076
01:16:43,960 --> 01:16:48,198
control if the field has a history of of

2077
01:16:46,679 --> 01:16:50,079
clipper injury you're probably going to

2078
01:16:48,198 --> 01:16:52,000
be dealing with this every year but if

2079
01:16:50,079 --> 01:16:53,679
you're further south and you're rotating

2080
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:55,800
this field every two or three years with

2081
01:16:53,679 --> 01:16:58,760
dayas you're unlike to see this as a

2082
01:16:55,800 --> 01:17:01,719
major problem for

2083
01:16:58,760 --> 01:17:03,800
you and I wanted to finish up there and

2084
01:17:01,719 --> 01:17:05,399
the bottom line here is with any of

2085
01:17:03,800 --> 01:17:07,159
these pests you really need to know what

2086
01:17:05,399 --> 01:17:09,279
your pest is and what your management

2087
01:17:07,158 --> 01:17:10,719
options are so if you ever have any

2088
01:17:09,279 --> 01:17:12,679
questions about what's going on out

2089
01:17:10,719 --> 01:17:14,920
there rather than run for a general

2090
01:17:12,679 --> 01:17:16,719
broadspectrum spray to try to solve the

2091
01:17:14,920 --> 01:17:18,679
problem uh first call your fruit

2092
01:17:16,719 --> 01:17:21,239
Specialist or your Cooperative Extension

2093
01:17:18,679 --> 01:17:23,399
Office have it properly identified and

2094
01:17:21,238 --> 01:17:25,000
and learn what all the options are and

2095
01:17:23,399 --> 01:17:27,079
not only how it's going to affect this

2096
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:29,238
pths but how it's going to affect the uh

2097
01:17:27,079 --> 01:17:32,399
impact on other paths and any Predators

2098
01:17:29,238 --> 01:17:34,399
or parasites that might be out there

2099
01:17:32,399 --> 01:17:36,279
places you can go for more information

2100
01:17:34,399 --> 01:17:38,439
would be the strawberry production guide

2101
01:17:36,279 --> 01:17:41,319
or enra 88 that's available through

2102
01:17:38,439 --> 01:17:43,039
nra.org or through Cornell or through uh

2103
01:17:41,319 --> 01:17:45,279
probably any extension office that deals

2104
01:17:43,039 --> 01:17:47,079
with small fruit uh for you organic

2105
01:17:45,279 --> 01:17:49,759
Growers there is an organic production

2106
01:17:47,079 --> 01:17:51,399
guide from atra uh I believe Cornell is

2107
01:17:49,760 --> 01:17:54,280
putting one together for strawberries as

2108
01:17:51,399 --> 01:17:55,719
well they're updating one um and for

2109
01:17:54,279 --> 01:17:57,359
those of you who were in New England the

2110
01:17:55,719 --> 01:17:59,560
New England small fruit Pest Management

2111
01:17:57,359 --> 01:18:01,559
guide you can access that online at this

2112
01:17:59,560 --> 01:18:03,600
website and finally if you're just

2113
01:18:01,560 --> 01:18:05,400
curious as to what some particular

2114
01:18:03,600 --> 01:18:07,760
symptoms are and you don't have ready

2115
01:18:05,399 --> 01:18:10,399
access to a live person you can go on to

2116
01:18:07,760 --> 01:18:11,880
the Cornell Berry diagnostic key and

2117
01:18:10,399 --> 01:18:13,399
they have some very good photos there

2118
01:18:11,880 --> 01:18:15,079
that you can track down it looks like

2119
01:18:13,399 --> 01:18:17,719
this or it looks like that and get a

2120
01:18:15,079 --> 01:18:21,399
pretty good idea of what is going

2121
01:18:17,719 --> 01:18:23,359
on um so with that Kathy do you want me

2122
01:18:21,399 --> 01:18:25,039
to start hitting Frank and I to start

2123
01:18:23,359 --> 01:18:26,079
hitting up the questions or do you want

2124
01:18:25,039 --> 01:18:29,359
to

2125
01:18:26,079 --> 01:18:31,439
go um yes that would be good there are a

2126
01:18:29,359 --> 01:18:34,399
couple of questions that you missed

2127
01:18:31,439 --> 01:18:37,559
earlier uh Ben is asking about neem oil

2128
01:18:34,399 --> 01:18:39,559
in terms of uh midde uh you have any

2129
01:18:37,560 --> 01:18:42,760
experience with that yeah NE oil is a

2130
01:18:39,560 --> 01:18:44,960
midde uh is at best what I would call

2131
01:18:42,760 --> 01:18:48,039
have some suppressant

2132
01:18:44,960 --> 01:18:50,319
uh uh characteristics uh basically what

2133
01:18:48,039 --> 01:18:52,800
you're trying to do is change the flavor

2134
01:18:50,319 --> 01:18:55,319
of that particular plant to the in to

2135
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:57,880
the might in this case um

2136
01:18:55,319 --> 01:19:00,479
I've had some Growers who've had only

2137
01:18:57,880 --> 01:19:01,960
fair luck with it for my money I I I

2138
01:19:00,479 --> 01:19:04,439
would probably invest If I Was An

2139
01:19:01,960 --> 01:19:06,880
organic grower uh I would probably be

2140
01:19:04,439 --> 01:19:09,000
more likely to invest in some predators

2141
01:19:06,880 --> 01:19:11,800
I think you'd have better luck with it

2142
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:13,119
um as I said it's a suppressant if

2143
01:19:11,800 --> 01:19:14,639
you're really in trouble and you have a

2144
01:19:13,119 --> 01:19:16,519
lot of mites out there it is not going

2145
01:19:14,639 --> 01:19:18,159
to take care of the problem for you if

2146
01:19:16,520 --> 01:19:20,360
you wanted to put it on as a matter of

2147
01:19:18,158 --> 01:19:23,719
course to try to keep small population

2148
01:19:20,359 --> 01:19:27,639
small you may get some impact that

2149
01:19:23,719 --> 01:19:29,158
way else Becky sidan is asking uh for

2150
01:19:27,639 --> 01:19:31,600
tarnish plant bug Management in day

2151
01:19:29,158 --> 01:19:33,279
neutrals since you can avoid mowing all

2152
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:34,880
summer would you recommend very tight

2153
01:19:33,279 --> 01:19:37,519
mowing in the vicinity of fields to

2154
01:19:34,880 --> 01:19:39,760
remove habitat yeah I I I'm sorry I

2155
01:19:37,520 --> 01:19:42,000
thought I had said that I said you can

2156
01:19:39,760 --> 01:19:43,639
either mow up until the time of

2157
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:46,479
flowering and then call it quits and not

2158
01:19:43,639 --> 01:19:48,199
mow from then on or just keep Mowing and

2159
01:19:46,479 --> 01:19:50,079
mow tight throughout the season so that

2160
01:19:48,198 --> 01:19:51,238
those plants don't have a chance the

2161
01:19:50,079 --> 01:19:52,800
plants that you're mowing don't have a

2162
01:19:51,238 --> 01:19:54,039
chance to get up and form flower buds

2163
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:56,560
that are going to become more attractive

2164
01:19:54,039 --> 01:19:58,800
to the tarnish plant bug so it's either

2165
01:19:56,560 --> 01:20:02,880
don't mow or if you do mow mow very

2166
01:19:58,800 --> 01:20:06,159
regularly uh to keep that vegetation

2167
01:20:02,880 --> 01:20:08,880
down and Raymond from Poland is asking

2168
01:20:06,158 --> 01:20:12,399
about a sale it's effective on the NYSE

2169
01:20:08,880 --> 01:20:14,600
and thinex both nyss and adults uh a

2170
01:20:12,399 --> 01:20:17,158
sale is most effective on the nymphs but

2171
01:20:14,600 --> 01:20:18,600
it will also take the adults thinex is

2172
01:20:17,158 --> 01:20:20,198
going to wipe the Slate clean it's going

2173
01:20:18,600 --> 01:20:23,120
to take out both the nymphs and the

2174
01:20:20,198 --> 01:20:25,079
adults that's correct thinex has more of

2175
01:20:23,119 --> 01:20:27,479
a knockdown than a sail but both of them

2176
01:20:25,079 --> 01:20:29,920
are pretty

2177
01:20:27,479 --> 01:20:31,359
good are there any other questions for

2178
01:20:29,920 --> 01:20:34,359
either Frank or

2179
01:20:31,359 --> 01:20:36,920

2180
01:20:34,359 --> 01:20:40,439
