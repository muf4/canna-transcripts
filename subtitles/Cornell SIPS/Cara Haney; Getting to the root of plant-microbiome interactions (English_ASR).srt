1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,158
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:04,158
University

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:11,400
yeah it's really fun to be back here Not

4
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:13,559
only was I an undergrad here I was a

5
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:15,298
plant science major and so I took the

6
00:00:13,558 --> 00:00:16,980
majority of my undergrad classes in this

7
00:00:15,298 --> 00:00:18,719
building and when I saw plant science

8
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:21,300
404 I was like I'm sure I've been in

9
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:23,879
that room and I heard many many seminars

10
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:24,719
in this so it's really fun to yeah to be

11
00:00:23,879 --> 00:00:26,939
here

12
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:28,018
um okay

13
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:30,000
so

14
00:00:28,018 --> 00:00:31,919
for most of my career as you can imagine

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,899
being a plant science major in this

16
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:37,140
department I've been really interested

17
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:38,880
in host microbe interactions and across

18
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:40,679
my career I've been really interested in

19
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:42,660
sort of the Continuum and the spectrum

20
00:00:40,679 --> 00:00:44,219
of host microbe and host pathogen

21
00:00:42,659 --> 00:00:47,578
interactions

22
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:49,859
um and so symbiosis I Define uh in sort

23
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:51,660
of its its classical definition which

24
00:00:49,859 --> 00:00:52,979
means living together

25
00:00:51,659 --> 00:00:54,299
um and I'm getting a little cut off at

26
00:00:52,979 --> 00:00:57,839
the bottom there but it includes

27
00:00:54,299 --> 00:00:59,759
pathogens mutualists and commensals um

28
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,559
and so I'm going to use it to mean sort

29
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:05,158
of all living together interactions

30
00:01:01,558 --> 00:01:06,298
including your mutualistic symbiosis

31
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:08,159
um but I've been really interested in

32
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:10,680
how hosts and microbes navigate this

33
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:12,299
Continuum so to host get to the side the

34
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:14,040
microbes decide and how when they come

35
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:17,939
together does that interaction determine

36
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:21,360
the outcome of this interaction

37
00:01:17,938 --> 00:01:23,879
um and so from my time uh in my PhD work

38
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:25,379
I learned that these these changes can

39
00:01:23,879 --> 00:01:27,359
actually occur over very short

40
00:01:25,379 --> 00:01:28,978
evolutionary distances and so

41
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:32,579
agrobacterium

42
00:01:28,978 --> 00:01:34,739
um our plant pathogen and cyanorezobium

43
00:01:32,579 --> 00:01:37,078
um a mutualist are actually very closely

44
00:01:34,739 --> 00:01:39,478
related so in the Box cut off down here

45
00:01:37,078 --> 00:01:42,739
is cyanore rhizobia which is very

46
00:01:39,478 --> 00:01:45,900
closely related to uh to agrobacterium

47
00:01:42,739 --> 00:01:48,719
which is also in the box that's a plant

48
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:49,920
pathogen and if you make a sentinel plot

49
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:51,478
of these

50
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,060
I don't know if I can actually pull that

51
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:55,679
down a little bit no

52
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:58,500
uh

53
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:01,320
okay you can see it over there thank you

54
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:03,659
um let's close down

55
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:06,618
oh okay

56
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:06,618
I thank you

57
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:16,139
um oh yeah on this one there we go too

58
00:02:11,818 --> 00:02:18,539
many computers and screens okay good

59
00:02:16,139 --> 00:02:20,759
um thank you

60
00:02:18,539 --> 00:02:23,459
so if you plot the genomes of

61
00:02:20,759 --> 00:02:25,378
agrobacterium here and cyanorezobium um

62
00:02:23,459 --> 00:02:28,199
you can see that they're actually uh

63
00:02:25,378 --> 00:02:30,659
very highly conserved so each dot is is

64
00:02:28,199 --> 00:02:32,399
a protein coding Gene and you can see

65
00:02:30,659 --> 00:02:34,378
that if you line them up uh they

66
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,180
actually align quite well with a few you

67
00:02:34,378 --> 00:02:38,280
know exceptions

68
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:40,140
um but over an evolutionary distance

69
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:43,378
where you can line up genomes you have a

70
00:02:40,139 --> 00:02:45,958
mutualist and a pathogen

71
00:02:43,378 --> 00:02:48,479
um so that suggests that relatively

72
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:50,759
small genomic changes can drive these

73
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:52,679
major transitions in Lifestyles between

74
00:02:50,759 --> 00:02:55,919
bacteria

75
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:58,680
and now I'm not advancing okay

76
00:02:55,919 --> 00:03:00,419
um so I actually my interest in these

77
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:03,060
sorts of questions started here in this

78
00:03:00,419 --> 00:03:04,619
department uh and uh often in this very

79
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:06,239
building I actually have used this slide

80
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:07,680
before I didn't even make it just for

81
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:08,878
the stock

82
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,640
um

83
00:03:08,878 --> 00:03:14,219
uh and I started working on this very

84
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:17,539
famous plant pathogen uh late blade

85
00:03:14,219 --> 00:03:20,340
which is a devastating uh you know

86
00:03:17,539 --> 00:03:23,219
pathogen and is about as far from

87
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:25,319
rhizobia legume and am fungi as you can

88
00:03:23,219 --> 00:03:27,300
get

89
00:03:25,318 --> 00:03:30,299
um

90
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:32,099
just a brief interlude I actually one of

91
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:35,340
my first classes that I took in this

92
00:03:32,098 --> 00:03:37,859
department was uh as a freshman my

93
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:40,920
faculty advisor suggested that I take

94
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:42,420
Plant Pathology and I went into Bill's

95
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:43,559
class and the first day everybody was

96
00:03:42,419 --> 00:03:45,298
talking about like our genes and

97
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:47,039
agrobacterium transformation and I had

98
00:03:45,299 --> 00:03:48,420
no idea what was going on

99
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:50,219
and I went up to Bill I don't know if

100
00:03:48,419 --> 00:03:51,719
you remember the story I went up to Bill

101
00:03:50,219 --> 00:03:53,759
uh and I was like I don't think I should

102
00:03:51,719 --> 00:03:55,500
be in this class because I have no idea

103
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:57,359
what's going on and you're like he was

104
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:59,818
like okay what's your name and I said

105
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,980
Cara Haney and he was like oh you're

106
00:03:59,818 --> 00:04:04,318
Irish you're only here because of a

107
00:04:01,979 --> 00:04:05,759
plant pathogen you should absolutely be

108
00:04:04,318 --> 00:04:07,738
in this class

109
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:09,419
and so it turns out that that's true and

110
00:04:07,739 --> 00:04:11,519
I had no idea at the time but my own

111
00:04:09,419 --> 00:04:14,219
personal family history was shaped by

112
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:15,959
plant micro interactions so my dad's

113
00:04:14,219 --> 00:04:18,779
family fled Ireland during the Irish

114
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:21,660
Potato Famine in the late 1880s and

115
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:24,000
immigrated uh to North America at that

116
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:26,520
time and so that I worked in Bill's lab

117
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,259
uh and so on but

118
00:04:26,519 --> 00:04:29,519
um from this you know there's been a few

119
00:04:28,259 --> 00:04:32,160
things that really have stuck with me

120
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:34,978
the first is that plant microbes have

121
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:37,560
shaped human history but second within

122
00:04:34,978 --> 00:04:39,060
this pathogen uh a single pathogen so

123
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:41,280
right I've talked about spectrum of

124
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:42,600
pathogens having multiple Lifestyles a

125
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:45,119
single pathogen can have multiple

126
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:47,160
Lifestyles so uh glycophthora is a case

127
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,660
where they have this biotrophic stage

128
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:50,160
where they look like they're not even

129
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:52,860
doing anything to the plants and then

130
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:56,220
they suddenly kill the plants something

131
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:58,199
else that uh I often um mention from

132
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:59,699
this is that you can also have tissue

133
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:01,680
specificity and I'll come back to that

134
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:03,120
at the end but with tomatoes and

135
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,680
potatoes and late blight sometimes you

136
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,660
see the fruits are like perfectly

137
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:08,699
healthy on the tomatoes and the leaves

138
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:10,020
are dead or the potato tubers will be

139
00:05:08,699 --> 00:05:12,240
completely rotten and the leaves look

140
00:05:10,019 --> 00:05:14,579
healthy so there seems to be uh yeah

141
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,300
something around tissue specificity that

142
00:05:14,579 --> 00:05:17,399
I

143
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:19,680
um I have sort of kept with me through

144
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:21,659
my career

145
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:24,120
um so about the time I graduated I heard

146
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:25,280
a seminar by a new professor that was

147
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:29,160
being recruited into the department

148
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:31,859
Maria Harrison and I suddenly was like

149
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:34,020
there's this whole other world of plant

150
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:36,720
pathogens or plant microbe interactions

151
00:05:34,019 --> 00:05:38,698
and so sort of inspired by working on

152
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:41,100
sort of The Other Extreme I went and

153
00:05:38,699 --> 00:05:43,080
worked with rhizobia legume um symbiosis

154
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:46,979
and an amazing thing about this system

155
00:05:43,079 --> 00:05:48,719
is that you have uh You Can Do genetics

156
00:05:46,978 --> 00:05:51,060
um in a way that is really difficult

157
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,919
with potatoes more feasible with

158
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:54,720
tomatoes

159
00:05:52,918 --> 00:05:57,299
um so in this mutualistic interaction

160
00:05:54,720 --> 00:06:00,600
you can screen for mutants that lose the

161
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:03,960
ability to form nodules uh and that have

162
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:06,060
lost the nitrogen fixings and biosis

163
00:06:03,959 --> 00:06:08,038
um but here you still have rhizobia in

164
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:08,639
these nodules and so

165
00:06:08,038 --> 00:06:11,219
um

166
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:13,639
uh there's a lot of questions that sort

167
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:16,199
of arose about how does the plant

168
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:18,360
control this how does the plant avoid

169
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:22,139
rhizobia becoming a pathogen taking more

170
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:24,900
nutrients uh then it can afford to share

171
00:06:22,139 --> 00:06:28,019
and then how do plants actually avoid

172
00:06:24,899 --> 00:06:30,060
being parasitized by these microbes uh

173
00:06:28,019 --> 00:06:31,680
and then as I mentioned our pathogens

174
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:35,300
are mutual is really so different as

175
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,300
these are very closely related to path

176
00:06:35,819 --> 00:06:40,860
um and so that in Sharon's lab I really

177
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:42,360
started thinking about this Continuum

178
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:44,939
um and I think it's best exemplified

179
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:46,560
with these Alpha proteobacteria as I

180
00:06:44,939 --> 00:06:49,500
mentioned where we have cyanorizobium

181
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:51,360
and agrobacterium as close relatives

182
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:53,220
um even more amazingly these are more

183
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:55,460
closely related to each other than they

184
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:58,199
are to Brady rhizobium which is another

185
00:06:55,459 --> 00:07:00,000
nitrogen-fixing mutualist

186
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:02,280
um and cyanoase opium is more closely

187
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,959
related to brucella which is

188
00:07:02,279 --> 00:07:05,959
um which is a pathogen of animals

189
00:07:06,899 --> 00:07:11,758
um and so

190
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:13,680
it turns out that plants pathogens and

191
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:16,759
mutualists have shared mechanisms to

192
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:19,439
infect a very different hosts so uh

193
00:07:16,759 --> 00:07:21,419
cyanorizobium is here infecting a bean

194
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:24,660
cell busella is here infecting a

195
00:07:21,418 --> 00:07:27,060
macrophage and for virulence they both

196
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:29,880
require some shared uh conserved

197
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:32,639
ancestral mechanisms

198
00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:35,159
um that are likely there to evade or

199
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:37,019
suppress host immunity

200
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:39,660
um and so confronted with the same

201
00:07:37,019 --> 00:07:42,478
challenge of how do you protect yourself

202
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:44,220
from uh from microbes whether it's a

203
00:07:42,478 --> 00:07:45,959
pathogen or a mutualist plants and

204
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:49,139
animals have actually convergently

205
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:52,079
evolved similar Solutions and so here

206
00:07:49,139 --> 00:07:54,120
are plants they have things like

207
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:56,698
flagellin receptors that can activate

208
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:59,819
defense signaling animals have actually

209
00:07:56,699 --> 00:08:01,319
convergently evolved similar pathways

210
00:07:59,819 --> 00:08:03,120
um and so confronted with the same

211
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:05,098
Challenge and given uh the same

212
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:07,860
molecular toolbox plants and animals can

213
00:08:05,098 --> 00:08:11,399
both sense pathogens and mutualists

214
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:13,439
um oh sorry pathogens uh non-self

215
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:15,060
amounts and immune response and so

216
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:16,978
microbes likely have evolved to

217
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:19,639
circumvent these Pathways using similar

218
00:08:16,978 --> 00:08:19,639
mechanisms

219
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:25,620
um and so my lab thinks about sort of

220
00:08:21,899 --> 00:08:28,098
two symbiotic continuums one is over

221
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:30,840
um actually probably evolutionary time

222
00:08:28,098 --> 00:08:33,179
from Free Living to symbiotic so micro

223
00:08:30,839 --> 00:08:34,978
existing from the environments have to

224
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:36,958
colonize hosts they have to actually

225
00:08:34,979 --> 00:08:40,080
circumvent these very specialized

226
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:43,918
adaptations in immunity to colonize a

227
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:46,139
host and so those adaptations might

228
00:08:43,918 --> 00:08:49,199
generally allow things like Priscilla or

229
00:08:46,139 --> 00:08:51,720
agrobacterium to be host Associated and

230
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:54,778
then the specific adaptations might be

231
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:56,339
more recently evolved that allow a

232
00:08:54,778 --> 00:08:58,919
common ancestor of brucella

233
00:08:56,339 --> 00:09:00,060
agrobacterium and ceterozobium all hosts

234
00:08:58,919 --> 00:09:01,740
associated

235
00:09:00,059 --> 00:09:04,619
and then more recent adaptations

236
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:07,379
determine whether it's a pathogen or a

237
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:08,820
mutualist along this continuum and so

238
00:09:07,379 --> 00:09:11,360
this is a model that my lab thinks about

239
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:11,360
a lot

240
00:09:12,778 --> 00:09:17,700
first how do you become symbiotic

241
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:20,940
and then once you're symbiotic how do

242
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:24,120
you become a pathogen a mutualist or a

243
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:26,160
mutualist or a commensal

244
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:28,259
and so today I'm going to tell you uh

245
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:30,240
three stories from the lab

246
00:09:28,259 --> 00:09:32,220
one thing I'm not going to talk about is

247
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:34,560
sort of common innovations that allow

248
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:35,639
symbiotic ancestors to become symbiotic

249
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:37,679
although that was something we're really

250
00:09:35,639 --> 00:09:42,259
interested in I'm going to talk about

251
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:46,819
once you're symbiotic how bacteria can

252
00:09:42,259 --> 00:09:49,319
can move along this symbiotic Continuum

253
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:51,600
of Lifestyles from pathogenic to

254
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:54,420
mutualist and so what are the mechanisms

255
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:56,700
that drive those transitions

256
00:09:54,419 --> 00:09:59,219
um second does the host have any stay so

257
00:09:56,700 --> 00:10:02,399
can hosts actually detect and enrich for

258
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:04,519
specific uh beneficial microbes

259
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:06,839
um and can they do so without

260
00:10:04,519 --> 00:10:09,959
enriching for pathogens

261
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:11,940
and a similar question uh are hosts able

262
00:10:09,958 --> 00:10:14,159
to distinguish closely related pathogens

263
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:15,959
and mutualists um in the context of the

264
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:19,639
microbiome where things like effectors

265
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:19,639
might not be playing as much of a role

266
00:10:20,039 --> 00:10:25,379
um so as Maria suggested my lab uses a

267
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:28,980
rabbit office as a model for microbiome

268
00:10:25,379 --> 00:10:31,500
studies and for many of the same reasons

269
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:33,240
that you all use it for immunity studies

270
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:35,700
or those of you that do use it for other

271
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:38,399
host pathogen interactions it's a great

272
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:40,019
system for forward and reverse genetics

273
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:42,120
um it's our validated reference plan so

274
00:10:40,019 --> 00:10:43,860
much of what we've learned in immunity

275
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:46,139
or flowering time

276
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:48,180
um have translated to other crop plants

277
00:10:46,139 --> 00:10:50,458
importantly the microbiome community of

278
00:10:48,179 --> 00:10:53,219
rabidopsis at a very high taxonomic

279
00:10:50,458 --> 00:10:55,799
level resembles crops and so it's it is

280
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:58,860
not a non-nodulating non-armuscular

281
00:10:55,799 --> 00:11:00,659
plants but if you look at the the

282
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:02,879
microbiome composition at least the

283
00:11:00,659 --> 00:11:06,059
phylum level it's very similar to our

284
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:08,578
crop plant so this is rice and corn here

285
00:11:06,059 --> 00:11:11,578
um and then I always like to remember

286
00:11:08,578 --> 00:11:14,039
that arabidopsis is a wild plants it's

287
00:11:11,578 --> 00:11:16,139
not domesticated and so

288
00:11:14,039 --> 00:11:18,599
um the natural variation and the tools

289
00:11:16,139 --> 00:11:20,939
that we have in arabidopsis are

290
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:23,278
arabidopsis adopting with its local

291
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:24,779
microbiota to its local environment and

292
00:11:23,278 --> 00:11:27,059
we haven't necessarily lost those

293
00:11:24,778 --> 00:11:29,600
interactions during domestication as we

294
00:11:27,059 --> 00:11:31,319
potentially have with some of our

295
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:33,120
foreign

296
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:34,740
so when I started working on the

297
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:36,360
microbiome and trying to ask questions

298
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:38,579
about

299
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:40,019
um sort of microbes moving a lot of this

300
00:11:38,578 --> 00:11:42,299
Continuum

301
00:11:40,019 --> 00:11:43,679
um I sort of took a page from all that I

302
00:11:42,299 --> 00:11:45,659
learned in this departments and the

303
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:48,179
power of things like pseudomonas stringy

304
00:11:45,659 --> 00:11:50,759
arabidopsis defines or pseudomonas from

305
00:11:48,179 --> 00:11:52,979
use Beto to find effectors and plant

306
00:11:50,759 --> 00:11:54,720
disease resistance genes and I decided

307
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:56,879
to focus just on a single microbe

308
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:59,100
associating with rapidopsis and we use

309
00:11:56,879 --> 00:12:00,600
pseudomonas fluorescence and the reason

310
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:02,220
is that it's enriched in the plant

311
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:03,659
rhizosphere

312
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:06,480
um so it's really good at colonizing

313
00:12:03,659 --> 00:12:08,219
plants is beneficial to plants so it can

314
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,600
protect them from pathogens and so we

315
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:11,759
know the outcome of that interaction

316
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:14,639
matters when it's there plants are more

317
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:16,379
disease resistant and they also uh

318
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:19,139
promote growth through a variety of

319
00:12:16,379 --> 00:12:21,000
nutrient and hormone-related mechanisms

320
00:12:19,139 --> 00:12:23,278
it's really interesting because its

321
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,740
function can't be inferred from taxonomy

322
00:12:23,278 --> 00:12:27,179
so if you look at a tree of pseudomonas

323
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:29,100
and then try to predict what they're

324
00:12:27,179 --> 00:12:30,539
going to be doing it actually doesn't

325
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:32,159
work and so that makes it really

326
00:12:30,539 --> 00:12:35,958
interesting for these sorts of studies

327
00:12:32,159 --> 00:12:35,958
and it's genetically trackable

328
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:40,860
um and then pseudomonas like the alpha

329
00:12:38,578 --> 00:12:43,078
proteobacteria actually shows those

330
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:45,120
patterns of host Association and

331
00:12:43,078 --> 00:12:48,239
lifestyle transitions within a single

332
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:50,220
genus and So within pseudomonas we have

333
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:52,740
originosa which are opportunistic

334
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:54,959
pathogens of actually plants and animals

335
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:56,519
there's reports of pseudomonas originosa

336
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:59,638
causing disease under very stressful

337
00:12:56,519 --> 00:13:00,980
field conditions like heat waves or poor

338
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:03,899
soil quality

339
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:06,300
uh we have pseudomonas stringy which you

340
00:13:03,899 --> 00:13:07,740
all know a lot about I'm sure that our

341
00:13:06,299 --> 00:13:09,838
plant pathogens

342
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:12,500
and then pseudomonas fluorescens which

343
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:16,500
are described as both plant and animal

344
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:19,919
symbionts and Free Living

345
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:21,299
and So within this group uh we we study

346
00:13:19,919 --> 00:13:24,000
them because first they're all hosts

347
00:13:21,299 --> 00:13:25,559
Associated and um originosa is really

348
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,899
fun because it's both plant and animal

349
00:13:25,559 --> 00:13:31,018
associated

350
00:13:27,899 --> 00:13:32,220
but we consider that a lot uh today I'm

351
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:33,839
going to tell you about pseudomonas

352
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:36,180
fluorescence

353
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:40,019
um and so we wanted to understand across

354
00:13:36,179 --> 00:13:41,819
this Continuum from mutualist to uh to

355
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:43,379
commensal so something that's not like

356
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:47,339
living with plants not necessarily

357
00:13:43,379 --> 00:13:49,320
provide causing harm or benefit

358
00:13:47,339 --> 00:13:51,899
um how quickly can those transitions

359
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:53,940
occur within this group and so we

360
00:13:51,899 --> 00:13:56,759
started uh this is actually the first

361
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:58,320
Pro Stock to join the lab Ryan Melnick

362
00:13:56,759 --> 00:14:00,419
um he asked within this group of

363
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:02,459
actually well-described mutualistic

364
00:14:00,419 --> 00:14:04,559
pseudomonas so these are plant growth

365
00:14:02,458 --> 00:14:06,778
promoters

366
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:09,899
um do they all promote growth or do some

367
00:14:06,778 --> 00:14:12,360
of them uh not promote growth and can we

368
00:14:09,899 --> 00:14:14,100
sort of understand the the genomic

369
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:16,560
changes that happen over these short

370
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:18,720
distances that would drive that and so

371
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:21,899
we started with our favorite

372
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:24,240
um lab model strain is wcs365 it's a

373
00:14:21,899 --> 00:14:25,620
nice plant growth promoter within this

374
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:27,778
group I just want to point out for

375
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:31,379
anybody that does 16s

376
00:14:27,778 --> 00:14:33,659
um sequencing these are 99 identical by

377
00:14:31,379 --> 00:14:35,879
16s so these are are very very closely

378
00:14:33,659 --> 00:14:38,100
related and often some of these would be

379
00:14:35,879 --> 00:14:40,198
called the same ASC um so basically

380
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:42,659
indistinguishable by 16s

381
00:14:40,198 --> 00:14:44,759
uh and then pseudomonas sort of species

382
00:14:42,659 --> 00:14:48,198
complex would be this whole group

383
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:48,198
students fluorescence

384
00:14:48,419 --> 00:14:52,559
um and so what we found that was quite

385
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:54,539
surprising was not only did not all of

386
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:55,859
these strains promote growth uh some of

387
00:14:54,539 --> 00:14:57,360
them kill plants

388
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:58,500
and so

389
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:00,360
um Ryan actually one of the first

390
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:02,879
strains he tested in the lab was this

391
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:05,759
n2c3 strain which is within that

392
00:15:02,879 --> 00:15:07,919
Brassica CRM group and not only did it

393
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:10,740
not promote growth it kills arabidopsis

394
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:12,179
under germ-free conditions I spent a

395
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:14,399
long time being convinced that Ryan just

396
00:15:12,179 --> 00:15:15,958
didn't know how to grow plants and it

397
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:17,759
was something he was doing but when he

398
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:20,039
did this with controls of other strains

399
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:22,439
that do not kill is clearly something

400
00:15:20,039 --> 00:15:23,939
unique about this strain I'll show you a

401
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:27,060
few graphs like this that are just death

402
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:28,980
Quantified so here's our n2c3 pathogen

403
00:15:27,059 --> 00:15:30,719
and then these under these conditions

404
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:33,000
actually don't promote growth super well

405
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,440
because this is rich media but they do

406
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,980
cause changes in lateral root

407
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,980
architecture

408
00:15:37,078 --> 00:15:42,120
um it turns out that n2c3 is a is a

409
00:15:40,019 --> 00:15:44,820
quite broad Host range pathogen so we

410
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:46,259
tested it on this is rice and we tested

411
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:47,940
on tomatoes and poppies and whatever

412
00:15:46,259 --> 00:15:49,139
people had lying around in the lab to

413
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:52,459
put in their Gardens and it basically

414
00:15:49,139 --> 00:15:52,459
killed everything that we could find

415
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:56,159
um and so Ryan actually came from a

416
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:57,778
genomics background

417
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:59,219
um and as part of what he was doing in

418
00:15:57,778 --> 00:16:01,799
the lab he was building a comparative

419
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:03,778
genomics pipeline to try to identify

420
00:16:01,799 --> 00:16:06,599
genomic traits that would be unique to

421
00:16:03,778 --> 00:16:08,820
one strain and not another and so the

422
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:11,040
idea here is that if we take

423
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:12,660
um The genome of our beneficial strains

424
00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:14,578
and compare to the genomes of our

425
00:16:12,659 --> 00:16:16,740
pathogen we should have most of it the

426
00:16:14,578 --> 00:16:18,838
same our core pseudomonas genome but the

427
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:20,879
genes required for pathogenesis or

428
00:16:18,839 --> 00:16:21,720
mutualism or commensalism should be

429
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:23,939
unique

430
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:25,320
to each of those strains

431
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:28,079
um and so he built actually a

432
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:29,760
pseudomonas pan genome um where he did

433
00:16:28,078 --> 00:16:32,219
all by all comparisons and then just

434
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:34,259
generated one giant pseudomonas genome

435
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:36,360
that now we can compare each genome to

436
00:16:34,259 --> 00:16:38,639
and that makes this a much easier

437
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:40,440
problem and these tools are available if

438
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:41,698
anybody is interested in the pseudomonas

439
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:44,100
ban genome

440
00:16:41,698 --> 00:16:47,758
uh but when he did this we found a very

441
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:50,839
conspicuous 143 KB genomic islands that

442
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:53,519
was unique to our pseudomonas pathogen

443
00:16:50,839 --> 00:16:56,040
that was inserted in otherwise a very

444
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:57,419
conserved region of the genome it turns

445
00:16:56,039 --> 00:16:59,578
out it encodes stringomycin

446
00:16:57,419 --> 00:17:01,439
stringopectin which you may have heard

447
00:16:59,578 --> 00:17:03,599
of because it was first described in

448
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:06,419
pseudomonas ringi

449
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:09,480
um and so these are toxins that cause

450
00:17:06,419 --> 00:17:11,459
disease on many plant hosts and so this

451
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:13,318
is pseudomonas stringy of bean that

452
00:17:11,459 --> 00:17:14,759
causes disease in a strangomycin

453
00:17:13,318 --> 00:17:16,438
strangle peptin dependent manner so

454
00:17:14,759 --> 00:17:17,818
these are mutants this is the wild type

455
00:17:16,439 --> 00:17:20,640
strain mutants that don't make the

456
00:17:17,818 --> 00:17:22,379
toxins uh disease goes away uh here's

457
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:25,679
another pseudomonas stringy on Cherry

458
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:27,480
again this spheringomycin strangle uh

459
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:30,540
peptin mutants no longer have a

460
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:33,179
reduction in disease

461
00:17:30,539 --> 00:17:35,519
um and so we deleted these in the single

462
00:17:33,179 --> 00:17:37,500
in our pathogenic strain and you can see

463
00:17:35,519 --> 00:17:39,480
stringomycin and stringopeptin work

464
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:41,759
synergistically to cause disease on

465
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:43,620
arabidopsis so if you delete either of

466
00:17:41,759 --> 00:17:44,940
them you lose disease

467
00:17:43,619 --> 00:17:47,639
um

468
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:50,038
and so that seems to be responsible for

469
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:52,259
disease but this was kind of surprising

470
00:17:50,038 --> 00:17:54,480
this is a pseudomonas fluorescence not a

471
00:17:52,259 --> 00:17:57,359
pseudomonas drinking and so we went back

472
00:17:54,480 --> 00:18:00,058
to our pseudomonas tree and it turns out

473
00:17:57,359 --> 00:18:01,740
that um within pseudomonas fluorescence

474
00:18:00,058 --> 00:18:02,819
these genes actually occur quite

475
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:04,980
frequently

476
00:18:02,819 --> 00:18:06,779
um and so here's pseudomonas stringy

477
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:10,798
and then these are all kind of the

478
00:18:06,779 --> 00:18:12,298
pseudomonas fluorescence uh clade at

479
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:15,000
large and you can see that there's some

480
00:18:12,298 --> 00:18:17,038
like pseudomonas tusco vaginae which is

481
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,720
known to cause race she thought that

482
00:18:17,038 --> 00:18:21,480
fall within the pseudomonas fluorescence

483
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:23,279
sort of species complex and then some

484
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:26,058
are actually very closely related to our

485
00:18:23,279 --> 00:18:29,038
pathogen that we found like pseudomonas

486
00:18:26,058 --> 00:18:31,619
causes tomato pith necrosis are squarely

487
00:18:29,038 --> 00:18:32,879
nestled in this fluorescence clean

488
00:18:31,619 --> 00:18:35,459
um and so it seems that this is actually

489
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:37,380
quite widespread within pseudomonas and

490
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:38,880
is is moving around

491
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:40,620
um so we wanted to understand more about

492
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:42,000
the inheritance in this group because it

493
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:43,739
looks kind of interesting we have one

494
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,960
group that looks like it's got it one

495
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:49,380
group that hasn't was this kind of one

496
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:51,660
horizontal transfer acquisition event

497
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:53,100
um that was just kind of lost in a few

498
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:55,380
strains here or something more

499
00:18:53,099 --> 00:18:57,119
complicated going on and so we took

500
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:59,880
advantage of the vast genomic

501
00:18:57,119 --> 00:19:02,339
information available for students and

502
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:04,380
if you zoom in just on that Nebraska CRM

503
00:19:02,339 --> 00:19:06,839
plan so these are all 99 identical by

504
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:09,480
16s and then this is the presence of

505
00:19:06,839 --> 00:19:10,558
that syringomycin stringopupton Island

506
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:12,779
um you can see that there's been

507
00:19:10,558 --> 00:19:14,639
multiple acquisition and loss events

508
00:19:12,779 --> 00:19:16,740
over a very short evolutionary distance

509
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:18,360
and so there's not like there was

510
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:20,579
probably an acquisition event you know

511
00:19:18,359 --> 00:19:22,558
here that resulted in all of these

512
00:19:20,579 --> 00:19:24,659
strains having it but there you can't

513
00:19:22,558 --> 00:19:27,298
explain this pattern here without

514
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:29,340
multiple gain and loss events and so it

515
00:19:27,298 --> 00:19:31,740
seems like this island

516
00:19:29,339 --> 00:19:33,599
is moving very uh being gained and lost

517
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:37,019
very readily throughout pseudomonas

518
00:19:33,599 --> 00:19:37,019
lessons genomes

519
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:41,400
um and just to sort of validate that

520
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:43,020
this gene or Gene cluster indeed towards

521
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:45,538
virulence we got our hands on a number

522
00:19:43,019 --> 00:19:47,400
of strains uh that have or don't have

523
00:19:45,538 --> 00:19:49,798
the islands all the ones in green don't

524
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:51,600
have the island the ones in red do and

525
00:19:49,798 --> 00:19:54,440
it seems to very closely correlate with

526
00:19:51,599 --> 00:19:54,439
with virulence

527
00:19:55,259 --> 00:19:59,460
um and so we're really intrigued by this

528
00:19:57,538 --> 00:20:01,919
um this idea that maybe you could have a

529
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:04,740
lifestyle transition over you know not

530
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:06,840
the distance of agrobacterium to cyanide

531
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:08,339
rhizobium but just over you know a

532
00:20:06,839 --> 00:20:10,619
single strain gaining and losing a

533
00:20:08,339 --> 00:20:12,359
single Island and so we wondered is that

534
00:20:10,619 --> 00:20:14,279
just it is it an island that's moving

535
00:20:12,359 --> 00:20:16,500
around and causing these lifestyle

536
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:18,058
transitions or is it something more

537
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:20,220
complicated and there's a beautiful

538
00:20:18,058 --> 00:20:21,960
example from Jeff Chang's lab showing

539
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:24,240
that rhodococcus through gaining a

540
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:25,558
single virulence the plasmid can

541
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:28,200
actually transition from a plant

542
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:31,918
commensal so associated with commensals

543
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:34,140
uh to um a pathogen just with acquiring

544
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:35,580
a single plasmid and so we wondered are

545
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:37,320
there other genomic changes that

546
00:20:35,579 --> 00:20:39,538
correlate with lifestyle or is it just

547
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:41,759
the presence absence of this island

548
00:20:39,538 --> 00:20:43,859
and so we did a genome-wide Association

549
00:20:41,759 --> 00:20:45,660
where we looked for genes that

550
00:20:43,859 --> 00:20:47,819
correlated with present absence of this

551
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:50,279
island and to our surprise we found

552
00:20:47,819 --> 00:20:52,319
several genome-wide changes

553
00:20:50,279 --> 00:20:54,240
and so this is our stringomycin strango

554
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:55,558
pepsin Island here in red and we found

555
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,880
two additional

556
00:20:55,558 --> 00:20:58,558
um they were annotated as putative

557
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,940
pathogenistic Islands we still don't

558
00:20:58,558 --> 00:21:02,519
know what they're doing but at least one

559
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:04,080
might be a toxin that are nearly

560
00:21:02,519 --> 00:21:06,779
perfectly correlated with our

561
00:21:04,079 --> 00:21:09,899
lipopeptide and then we found two

562
00:21:06,779 --> 00:21:11,639
islands and a putative effector that are

563
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:13,380
nearly perfectly inversely correlated

564
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:14,940
and this is probably too small to see

565
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:17,220
but this one here is actually a Type 3

566
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:19,440
secretion Island that is almost uniquely

567
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:20,460
present in the commensal not the

568
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:23,340
pathogen

569
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:25,140
uh and then this is dapg which is a

570
00:21:23,339 --> 00:21:26,579
known anti-fungal compound made by

571
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:28,500
pseudomonas that's been implicated in

572
00:21:26,579 --> 00:21:31,558
suppressive soils

573
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:33,960
um and so we have uh yeah two sort of

574
00:21:31,558 --> 00:21:36,240
configurations of the genome one with

575
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:40,259
this stringomycensoringopeptin and then

576
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:42,000
one with type 3 secretion and dapg

577
00:21:40,259 --> 00:21:44,819
um and so we think that pseudomonas has

578
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,558
kind of converged on two solutions for

579
00:21:44,819 --> 00:21:48,480
plants and actually fungal Association

580
00:21:46,558 --> 00:21:50,339
so I didn't mention that the

581
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:53,880
stringomycin stringopeptin um

582
00:21:50,339 --> 00:21:57,058
lipopeptide islands is also anti-fungal

583
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:59,159
and so one version is lipopeptides plus

584
00:21:57,058 --> 00:22:01,940
these two pathogenicity islands and then

585
00:21:59,159 --> 00:22:04,440
the other is Type 3 secretion plus dapg

586
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:06,360
and all strains that have these they end

587
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:07,679
up in the same genomic location and we

588
00:22:06,359 --> 00:22:08,639
have evidence that they're being gained

589
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:10,140
and lost through homologous

590
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:12,419
recombination

591
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:14,100
and so it seems that pseudomonas has two

592
00:22:12,419 --> 00:22:15,659
pseudomonas fluorescence has two

593
00:22:14,099 --> 00:22:17,939
Lifestyles that are

594
00:22:15,659 --> 00:22:20,880
um uh transitioning over very short

595
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:22,140
evolutionary distances

596
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:25,140
um

597
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:27,240
and so it seems that even within very

598
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:29,100
closely related plants

599
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:31,019
um uh Associated strains you can get

600
00:22:29,099 --> 00:22:33,658
these transitions with just gain and

601
00:22:31,019 --> 00:22:34,980
loss of a single Island

602
00:22:33,659 --> 00:22:35,760
um so now I'm going to switch gears a

603
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:37,200
little bit

604
00:22:35,759 --> 00:22:40,200
and talk about

605
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:42,298
um the sort of role of the host in this

606
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:44,460
um and so did the hosts have any say can

607
00:22:42,298 --> 00:22:46,259
they specifically enrich for beneficial

608
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:47,759
microbes or even specific groups in

609
00:22:46,259 --> 00:22:49,859
microbes and then as they're enriching

610
00:22:47,759 --> 00:22:52,519
how do they filter out which ones are

611
00:22:49,859 --> 00:22:52,519
good and bad

612
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:01,140
um

613
00:22:58,319 --> 00:23:03,720
so plants do something really cool which

614
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:05,700
is that under certain stress conditions

615
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:08,339
my slides got

616
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:09,298
missing a slide okay

617
00:23:08,339 --> 00:23:11,099
um

618
00:23:09,298 --> 00:23:12,720
maybe I got shuffled here

619
00:23:11,099 --> 00:23:14,879
so uh

620
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:16,860
plants and animals it's known that a

621
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:19,020
normal microbiome structure

622
00:23:16,859 --> 00:23:22,199
is really important for host health and

623
00:23:19,019 --> 00:23:23,759
so our gut if we end up with an altered

624
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:27,740
microbiome community that can make us

625
00:23:23,759 --> 00:23:29,879
really sick we're associated with a more

626
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:32,519
susceptibility to autoimmune diseases

627
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:34,860
and pathogens and the same is true for

628
00:23:32,519 --> 00:23:37,500
plants so the slide I'm missing you

629
00:23:34,859 --> 00:23:39,899
would see that the if there's a plant

630
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:41,519
that's missing actually it's a big

631
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:45,960
component of its innate immune system

632
00:23:41,519 --> 00:23:47,700
you can get disease from microbiota

633
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:49,380
um plants also do something cool where

634
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:51,179
they can specifically enrich for

635
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:54,179
beneficial microbes and so the classic

636
00:23:51,179 --> 00:23:55,440
example of this is suppressive soils and

637
00:23:54,179 --> 00:23:57,000
something I learned about in Plant

638
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:58,620
Pathology class there were two

639
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,599
mechanisms of disease resistance our

640
00:23:58,619 --> 00:24:02,038
genes and suppressive soils

641
00:24:00,599 --> 00:24:03,599
um suppressive soils were not well

642
00:24:02,038 --> 00:24:06,720
understood but this is a phenomenon

643
00:24:03,599 --> 00:24:08,459
where upon sensing a pathogen plants can

644
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:10,860
enrich for groups of microbes that can

645
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:12,538
suppress that pathogen

646
00:24:10,859 --> 00:24:14,819
um this hasn't been described in animals

647
00:24:12,538 --> 00:24:17,339
and it turns out it's not unique to

648
00:24:14,819 --> 00:24:19,500
biotic stress plants can also do this in

649
00:24:17,339 --> 00:24:21,959
response to abiotic stress and so

650
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:24,179
there's been some beautiful work from uh

651
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:26,279
from Devin colemander and the Sundries

652
00:24:24,179 --> 00:24:28,140
in lab at UC Davis showing that under

653
00:24:26,279 --> 00:24:30,418
drought stress plants also shift their

654
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:33,179
microbiome and so this is

655
00:24:30,419 --> 00:24:34,799
drought-strapped drought stressed grass

656
00:24:33,179 --> 00:24:38,460
plants you get this massive enrichment

657
00:24:34,798 --> 00:24:40,859
of streptomyces and like bacteria in

658
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:42,419
suppressive soils streptomyces are

659
00:24:40,859 --> 00:24:43,979
sufficient to protect against drought

660
00:24:42,419 --> 00:24:46,080
stress

661
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:48,120
um and so this uh both suppressive soils

662
00:24:46,079 --> 00:24:50,819
and the drought examples suggest that

663
00:24:48,119 --> 00:24:52,319
under biotic or abiotic stress plants

664
00:24:50,819 --> 00:24:54,779
might actually be able to dynamically

665
00:24:52,319 --> 00:24:57,359
enrich for these beneficial microbes to

666
00:24:54,779 --> 00:24:59,519
help protect against those stresses and

667
00:24:57,359 --> 00:25:02,038
so we're really interested can plants

668
00:24:59,519 --> 00:25:03,538
enrich for pseudomonas under conditions

669
00:25:02,038 --> 00:25:06,179
where pseudomonas would be beneficial

670
00:25:03,538 --> 00:25:07,679
and if so can they tell apart can they

671
00:25:06,179 --> 00:25:11,580
enrich for just our beneficial

672
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:13,679
pseudomonas and not the pathogenic ones

673
00:25:11,579 --> 00:25:14,418
um and so to get at this

674
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:16,919
um

675
00:25:14,419 --> 00:25:18,960
genetic screening with microbiome has

676
00:25:16,919 --> 00:25:20,940
been very difficult because microbiome

677
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:23,159
phenotypes are often hard and

678
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:24,900
labor-intensive to screen for

679
00:25:23,159 --> 00:25:27,480
um and so what we've decided to do was

680
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:28,860
to take advantage of um of a mutant

681
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:31,319
collection that had been developed in

682
00:25:28,859 --> 00:25:33,240
fed ossabel's lab and this is a really

683
00:25:31,319 --> 00:25:36,240
unique mutant collection because it was

684
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:37,679
screened for uh root immunity phenotypes

685
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:39,778
and so these are mutants that when you

686
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:42,419
add a plant hormone that normally

687
00:25:39,778 --> 00:25:44,519
suppresses root immunity so pattern

688
00:25:42,419 --> 00:25:47,159
triggered immunity they're actually

689
00:25:44,519 --> 00:25:48,839
insensitive to that hormone response so

690
00:25:47,159 --> 00:25:51,299
the details aren't super important for

691
00:25:48,839 --> 00:25:54,000
these purposes the original paper was

692
00:25:51,298 --> 00:25:55,980
described here but the point is that

693
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,200
these mutants are specific to root

694
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:59,640
immunity mutants involved in pattern

695
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:01,200
triggered immunity

696
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:03,059
and so we had a collection of

697
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:04,919
uncharacterized mutants and we

698
00:26:03,058 --> 00:26:07,339
rescreened them for ability to support

699
00:26:04,919 --> 00:26:10,140
pseudomonas fastens in mono Association

700
00:26:07,339 --> 00:26:11,699
and we do this by growing arabidopsis in

701
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:14,460
48 well plates and then we can add

702
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:16,860
pseudomonas fluorescence expressing gfp

703
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:20,880
and then read pseudomonas fluorescence

704
00:26:16,859 --> 00:26:23,038
gfp with a Plate Reader as a proxy

705
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:25,380
versus a really easy way to quickly

706
00:26:23,038 --> 00:26:28,319
quantify um

707
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:31,260
and so doing this we found that

708
00:26:28,319 --> 00:26:33,298
um are mutants we found three that have

709
00:26:31,259 --> 00:26:35,278
higher levels of pseudomonas and we

710
00:26:33,298 --> 00:26:37,079
found three that have lower levels of

711
00:26:35,278 --> 00:26:39,720
pseudomonas

712
00:26:37,079 --> 00:26:40,678
and so we have pre-prints about these

713
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:43,259
two

714
00:26:40,679 --> 00:26:46,400
um and I'll tell you about hsm13 today

715
00:26:43,259 --> 00:26:46,400
that has more signals

716
00:26:50,519 --> 00:26:56,460
um Okay so

717
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:59,100
this plant mutant hsm13 has more

718
00:26:56,460 --> 00:27:01,679
pseudomonas in mono association with

719
00:26:59,099 --> 00:27:03,480
just a rabbitopsis and so the first

720
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:05,220
thing that we did was to take it and

721
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:06,900
plant it in natural soil and see if it

722
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:09,600
also had more pseudomonas when there's a

723
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:12,240
Complex Community present and it does so

724
00:27:09,599 --> 00:27:13,740
this is pseudomonas fluorescence gets

725
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:16,620
its name because it's fluorescence under

726
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:18,740
iron limiting conditions and so hsm13

727
00:27:16,619 --> 00:27:20,699
has about 10 times more

728
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:23,579
pseudomonasaurescence per gram of root

729
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:24,900
than wild type plants and this is bulk

730
00:27:23,579 --> 00:27:27,000
soil which has relatively low

731
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:30,298
pseudomonas and this is Quantified here

732
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:32,339
so this is cfu fluorescent colonies per

733
00:27:30,298 --> 00:27:34,319
gram of root

734
00:27:32,339 --> 00:27:36,178
um we can also do microbiome sequencing

735
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:37,918
to look at the entire community and see

736
00:27:36,179 --> 00:27:39,538
if it's is it just pseudomonas that's

737
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:41,038
different or are there larger Community

738
00:27:39,538 --> 00:27:42,538
changes

739
00:27:41,038 --> 00:27:45,480
um and here we actually found that wild

740
00:27:42,538 --> 00:27:46,619
type and the hsm-13 Newtons look quite

741
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:48,179
similar

742
00:27:46,619 --> 00:27:49,918
um and so you can see this is a

743
00:27:48,179 --> 00:27:53,220
principal component analysis and they

744
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:55,919
separate along this axis although that's

745
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:58,200
a smaller portion of the variation then

746
00:27:55,919 --> 00:28:00,419
this axis which explains bulk soil

747
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:02,038
versus the plant genotypes but when we

748
00:28:00,419 --> 00:28:03,960
look at the taxonomic levels they're

749
00:28:02,038 --> 00:28:06,960
actually quite similar

750
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:09,058
um so this is phylum level

751
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:11,278
and then when we looked at individual

752
00:28:09,058 --> 00:28:13,558
taxa that were different and explain the

753
00:28:11,278 --> 00:28:16,259
difference we see here it was largely

754
00:28:13,558 --> 00:28:18,119
limited to this family pseudomona DC and

755
00:28:16,259 --> 00:28:20,640
so this is a relative abundance plot

756
00:28:18,119 --> 00:28:22,798
there are some other taxes that are are

757
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:24,600
different but the most dramatic change

758
00:28:22,798 --> 00:28:25,980
was actually enrichment of pseudomonas

759
00:28:24,599 --> 00:28:30,778
where we have

760
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:32,220
um uh way higher in hs713.

761
00:28:30,778 --> 00:28:34,619
um interestingly there's some signatures

762
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:37,679
of dysbiosis in this mutants although

763
00:28:34,619 --> 00:28:39,538
it's very pseudomonas specific here and

764
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:42,900
there's much less diversity so we get a

765
00:28:39,538 --> 00:28:45,778
drop in total bacterial diversity by a

766
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:49,019
number of otsus and also

767
00:28:45,778 --> 00:28:51,240
um uh Shannon diversity index

768
00:28:49,019 --> 00:28:53,579
um and so we wondered is this microbiome

769
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:55,679
from hsm13 is this a beneficial

770
00:28:53,579 --> 00:28:58,019
Community or is this sort of a dysbiotic

771
00:28:55,679 --> 00:29:00,480
community that can make plants sick

772
00:28:58,019 --> 00:29:02,038
um and uh first author of this paper Yi

773
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:04,259
did a really clever microbiome

774
00:29:02,038 --> 00:29:07,500
transplant experiment where he grew

775
00:29:04,259 --> 00:29:09,419
either hsm13 or wild type plants in

776
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:11,099
natural soil and so he let the plant

777
00:29:09,419 --> 00:29:12,600
shift the community so enrich for

778
00:29:11,099 --> 00:29:14,399
whatever it's going to enrich for then

779
00:29:12,599 --> 00:29:17,639
he removed the plants and put wild type

780
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:20,100
plants in both soils and then asked what

781
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:21,419
the effect of just the soil is on plant

782
00:29:20,099 --> 00:29:23,339
health

783
00:29:21,419 --> 00:29:26,278
um and in doing this he found that the

784
00:29:23,339 --> 00:29:27,959
wild type plants and wild type soil were

785
00:29:26,278 --> 00:29:30,960
much smaller than wild type plants in

786
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:33,179
the hsm-13 soil

787
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:35,460
um and you can see this correlates quite

788
00:29:33,179 --> 00:29:37,019
nicely with increased pseudomonas

789
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:40,259
fluorescence so there's more pseudomonas

790
00:29:37,019 --> 00:29:42,480
in these soils and so you get growth

791
00:29:40,259 --> 00:29:44,879
and so it seems at least that the hsm13

792
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:46,500
microbiome isn't harmful under these

793
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:48,000
conditions although we're enriching for

794
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:50,159
pseudomonas and I'll come back to that

795
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:54,119
later because here I'm talking about

796
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:56,460
pseudomonas as one group of things

797
00:29:54,119 --> 00:29:59,879
um so we were able to map HSN 13 and it

798
00:29:56,460 --> 00:30:02,278
encodes ferronia kinase so

799
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:04,080
um hsm13 has a point mutation in the

800
00:30:02,278 --> 00:30:06,778
kinase domain about actually

801
00:30:04,079 --> 00:30:08,579
well-studied uh kinase receptor-like

802
00:30:06,778 --> 00:30:11,700
kinase called fronia

803
00:30:08,579 --> 00:30:13,379
um as you can see hsm13 is 4-8 which

804
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:15,960
tells you that seven other people have

805
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:18,179
found fronia out of screens and so it's

806
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:19,798
a very well studied rlk

807
00:30:18,179 --> 00:30:21,179
um and I won't go into the details

808
00:30:19,798 --> 00:30:24,298
because it's published but this is just

809
00:30:21,179 --> 00:30:27,240
showing that it indeed is fronia

810
00:30:24,298 --> 00:30:29,398
so what does fronia do it is a master

811
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:33,599
regulator of immunity and development

812
00:30:29,398 --> 00:30:34,979
which is great in not great in many ways

813
00:30:33,599 --> 00:30:36,839
because then you have to kind of filter

814
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:38,099
through all of the ways that fronia

815
00:30:36,839 --> 00:30:39,418
could be affecting your particular

816
00:30:38,099 --> 00:30:40,740
phenotype

817
00:30:39,419 --> 00:30:42,000
and so it does have a role in

818
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:44,099
development

819
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:47,220
um we're able to kind of uncouple that

820
00:30:44,099 --> 00:30:49,139
from our role in microbiome so I'm not

821
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:51,778
going to go into that in detail but in

822
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:53,340
immunity fronia has a few known rules so

823
00:30:51,778 --> 00:30:56,099
one is that it's known to interact with

824
00:30:53,339 --> 00:30:59,879
back one and fls2 which are receptors

825
00:30:56,099 --> 00:31:02,339
for microbeassociated molecular patterns

826
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:04,799
um and so we thought maybe if you lose

827
00:31:02,339 --> 00:31:07,139
um a pattern triggered immunity you

828
00:31:04,798 --> 00:31:08,879
would get increased pseudomonas

829
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:10,919
um second it's known to be a negative

830
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:12,299
regulator of mixed two which regulates

831
00:31:10,919 --> 00:31:15,840
dasmatic acid signaling which

832
00:31:12,298 --> 00:31:18,298
antagonizes salicylic acid uh and so

833
00:31:15,839 --> 00:31:20,579
that could also uh result in increased

834
00:31:18,298 --> 00:31:24,298
pseudomonas fluorescence and then it

835
00:31:20,579 --> 00:31:26,519
also regulates a basal levels of Roth in

836
00:31:24,298 --> 00:31:27,898
Roots so this is reactive oxygen that's

837
00:31:26,519 --> 00:31:29,519
just involved in normal growth and

838
00:31:27,898 --> 00:31:31,859
development it's not your rust burst

839
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:33,119
inducible rust it's just rust that's

840
00:31:31,859 --> 00:31:35,459
signaling and involved in like

841
00:31:33,119 --> 00:31:37,398
cross-linking cell walls and so we

842
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:39,960
thought that that reactive oxygen

843
00:31:37,398 --> 00:31:42,058
regulation could also be normally

844
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:44,340
inhibiting pseudomonas

845
00:31:42,058 --> 00:31:47,460
and so we tested mutants in all of these

846
00:31:44,339 --> 00:31:49,199
pathways to try to see if loss of any of

847
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:51,538
these Pathways affected Rises to your

848
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:54,000
pseudomonas and actually we found that

849
00:31:51,538 --> 00:31:55,980
knocking out pattern triggered immunity

850
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:58,380
um in single mutants

851
00:31:55,980 --> 00:32:01,500
does not affect rhizosphere pseudomonas

852
00:31:58,380 --> 00:32:05,220
we have now tested it back one Circle

853
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:06,778
and BBC BBC back when big one Cirque one

854
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:08,940
triple mutant and you get a very slight

855
00:32:06,778 --> 00:32:11,460
increase but it still doesn't explain uh

856
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:14,100
the fronia phenotype

857
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:16,140
um jasmatic acid signaling has no effect

858
00:32:14,099 --> 00:32:18,359
I was actually only when we tested rbo

859
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:20,159
HD and F which are involved in reactive

860
00:32:18,359 --> 00:32:22,500
oxygen production that we saw an

861
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:24,899
increase in pseudomonas um that's

862
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:27,000
starting to reach uh the level of the

863
00:32:24,898 --> 00:32:29,158
fronia mutants and then this is reactive

864
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,960
oxygen staining so this is wild type and

865
00:32:29,159 --> 00:32:32,580
then this is the ferronium mutants and

866
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:34,440
then these are the wild type infronium

867
00:32:32,579 --> 00:32:36,418
mutants with pseudomonas and so again

868
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:37,259
you can see that the level of reactive

869
00:32:36,419 --> 00:32:39,299
oxygen

870
00:32:37,259 --> 00:32:41,579
correlates with the level of pseudomonas

871
00:32:39,298 --> 00:32:43,619
and The Roots so the the green here is

872
00:32:41,579 --> 00:32:45,538
more reactive oxygen and then when we

873
00:32:43,619 --> 00:32:49,379
have less reactive oxygen on fronia

874
00:32:45,538 --> 00:32:51,538
that's when we have more pseudomonas

875
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:53,820
and so to test if this was really the

876
00:32:51,538 --> 00:32:56,579
pathway that was involved Yi over

877
00:32:53,819 --> 00:32:58,379
expressed this rap2 which is Downstream

878
00:32:56,579 --> 00:33:00,058
of fronia to ask if this could bypass

879
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:01,559
the need for ferronia and regulating

880
00:33:00,058 --> 00:33:03,599
reactive oxygen

881
00:33:01,558 --> 00:33:06,480
and so here's our parental line and then

882
00:33:03,599 --> 00:33:09,359
the HSM 13 mutants and if you over

883
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:11,640
Express this rock in the hsm13 mutant

884
00:33:09,359 --> 00:33:13,558
you have a dramatic reduction in the

885
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:15,240
amount of pseudomonas suggesting if you

886
00:33:13,558 --> 00:33:16,980
increase the level of reactive oxygen

887
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:18,480
you can actually decrease the level of

888
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:20,038
pseudomonas

889
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:21,778
um and so that suggests that indeed it's

890
00:33:20,038 --> 00:33:24,658
this pathway and not something related

891
00:33:21,778 --> 00:33:27,859
to PTI that's regulating

892
00:33:24,659 --> 00:33:27,860
um rise of steer pseudomos

893
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:32,460
um so interestingly

894
00:33:30,898 --> 00:33:34,199
um it turns out that fungal pathogens

895
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:35,759
and nematodes can make the ligand for

896
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:37,558
feral cap um and so there's two

897
00:33:35,759 --> 00:33:40,079
beautiful papers that show that

898
00:33:37,558 --> 00:33:42,839
nematodes and fungal pathogens can make

899
00:33:40,079 --> 00:33:44,639
Ralph peptides which are the mimics of

900
00:33:42,839 --> 00:33:46,500
Ralph peptides which are the ligand for

901
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:49,860
fronia

902
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:52,140
um and so they likely do this because by

903
00:33:49,859 --> 00:33:54,240
um by messing with fronia they can

904
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:56,038
actually mess with the ja pathway and

905
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:58,558
promote susceptibility to themselves so

906
00:33:56,038 --> 00:34:01,398
jasmatic acid is required for resistance

907
00:33:58,558 --> 00:34:03,839
to both fungal pathogens and nematodes

908
00:34:01,398 --> 00:34:05,759
and so um we thought that was really

909
00:34:03,839 --> 00:34:07,558
cool because this could potentially be a

910
00:34:05,759 --> 00:34:09,599
way for plants to sense these fungal

911
00:34:07,558 --> 00:34:11,579
pathogens and nematodes and then enrich

912
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:14,280
for pseudomonas which has been

913
00:34:11,579 --> 00:34:16,259
implicated in suppressive soils and so

914
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:18,780
we asked if just adding Ralph peptides

915
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:21,179
so the ligand fornia I was sufficient to

916
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:22,740
recruit pseudomonas and we did this in a

917
00:34:21,179 --> 00:34:24,780
couple ways so first we tried adding

918
00:34:22,739 --> 00:34:27,178
exogenous rough peptides as you can see

919
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:28,919
there's at least 33 of them so there's a

920
00:34:27,179 --> 00:34:31,320
lot um we just picked a couple that had

921
00:34:28,918 --> 00:34:33,658
been implicated in um in immune

922
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:36,119
signaling and we're like the fungal

923
00:34:33,659 --> 00:34:39,000
pathogens but we've got a small but

924
00:34:36,119 --> 00:34:42,059
significant increase in pseudomonas

925
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:44,099
um with uh one of them or else 33 here

926
00:34:42,059 --> 00:34:45,299
and this was dependent on ferronia so

927
00:34:44,099 --> 00:34:48,300
you don't see the increase in the

928
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:50,940
feronium mutant and we also over

929
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:52,800
expressed one of the Ralph peptides and

930
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:54,599
you get an increase in rhizosterous

931
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:57,539
pseudomonas um just with the presence of

932
00:34:54,599 --> 00:34:58,320
the ligand and so we think that

933
00:34:57,539 --> 00:35:00,900
um

934
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:03,240
uh fungal and nematode pathogens may

935
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:05,519
make Ralph peptides and they do so with

936
00:35:03,239 --> 00:35:07,618
the goal of inhibiting jasmonic acid

937
00:35:05,519 --> 00:35:09,599
signaling and promoting susceptibility

938
00:35:07,619 --> 00:35:11,300
to themselves and then plants may be

939
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:15,119
guarding this pathway

940
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:17,460
by down regulating reactive oxygen basal

941
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:19,320
reactive oxygen bubbles which in turn

942
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:23,119
results in more pseudomonas that could

943
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:23,119
protect them from these fungal pathogens

944
00:35:25,139 --> 00:35:30,358
okay so

945
00:35:27,059 --> 00:35:32,578
um 10 minutes sorry okay

946
00:35:30,358 --> 00:35:35,578
uh okay so I've told you two stories um

947
00:35:32,579 --> 00:35:37,320
one one of the uh that bacteria can

948
00:35:35,579 --> 00:35:39,780
transition over short evolutionary

949
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:41,760
distances and then the plants can sort

950
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:43,380
of generally enrich for pseudomonas that

951
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:45,480
results in benefit

952
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:47,338
um these two things are kind of uh you

953
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:48,960
know even in the lab a little bit at

954
00:35:47,338 --> 00:35:50,519
odds with each other right so I have

955
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:52,800
pseudomonas as one group that's all

956
00:35:50,519 --> 00:35:54,599
beneficial and then pseudomonas where we

957
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:56,760
have pathogens and mutualists that are

958
00:35:54,599 --> 00:35:58,680
super closely related

959
00:35:56,760 --> 00:36:01,020
um and so a question that I think

960
00:35:58,679 --> 00:36:02,338
naturally follows is can plants tell

961
00:36:01,019 --> 00:36:04,259
these apart when they're enriching for

962
00:36:02,338 --> 00:36:06,299
pseudomonas are they able to just enrich

963
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:08,400
The Beneficial ones

964
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:10,800
um and so we first asked this uh using

965
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:12,480
our ferronium mutant to ask in this

966
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:14,940
mutant are you only enriching for

967
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:16,679
beneficial pseudomonas and so here we

968
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:18,179
have uh pseudomonas commensals

969
00:36:16,679 --> 00:36:19,858
pseudomonas pathogens and then

970
00:36:18,179 --> 00:36:22,139
non-seudomonas

971
00:36:19,858 --> 00:36:25,199
um and then in green our wild type

972
00:36:22,139 --> 00:36:27,900
plants and blue are ferronium mutant

973
00:36:25,199 --> 00:36:30,299
and so you can see commensals all

974
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:32,460
enriched in fronia with the exception of

975
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:34,140
um of this one which I think is super

976
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:36,780
interesting and we don't know why

977
00:36:34,139 --> 00:36:38,879
but the pathogens are also enriched in

978
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:39,839
ferronia so this is pseudomonas ringi

979
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:42,000
here

980
00:36:39,838 --> 00:36:44,159
um uh some of our opportunistic

981
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:46,920
pathogens like the n2c3 I told you about

982
00:36:44,159 --> 00:36:48,960
and pseudomonas originosa and so it

983
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:52,320
seems like that's not it can't tell them

984
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:54,240
apart at least in this mono Association

985
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:57,059
uh that ferronia is enriching for

986
00:36:54,239 --> 00:36:59,939
pathogens and mutualists

987
00:36:57,059 --> 00:37:02,578
however pseudomonas are not great soil

988
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:03,720
pathogens um and so if anybody knows of

989
00:37:02,579 --> 00:37:05,700
cases in the literature where

990
00:37:03,719 --> 00:37:08,399
pseudomonas are roots or soil pathogens

991
00:37:05,699 --> 00:37:10,439
I'd be really interested uh but it seems

992
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:13,019
that generally their leaf and stem

993
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:15,480
pathogens uh and so

994
00:37:13,019 --> 00:37:18,420
uh just to sort of illustrate this on

995
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:20,460
plates if you add dc3000 to arabidopsis

996
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:23,760
Roots right not on the leaves you get

997
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:25,679
stunting of plants even with dc-3000 and

998
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:28,079
then this is our opportunistic pathogen

999
00:37:25,679 --> 00:37:30,118
but if you take arabidopsis and you grow

1000
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:32,880
them in natural soil and you drench the

1001
00:37:30,119 --> 00:37:35,099
soil with dc3000 you get no disease and

1002
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:36,720
we have tried like and every time we see

1003
00:37:35,099 --> 00:37:39,119
a spot on the leaf it's probably that it

1004
00:37:36,719 --> 00:37:40,559
just kind of flashed onto the leaves

1005
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:42,059
um and so that suggests that maybe

1006
00:37:40,559 --> 00:37:44,599
there's something about the soil

1007
00:37:42,059 --> 00:37:44,599
community that is

1008
00:37:44,699 --> 00:37:46,699
um

1009
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:51,000
and so

1010
00:37:48,358 --> 00:37:52,739
um this is a master's project from a

1011
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:55,199
student alive who asked if just in

1012
00:37:52,739 --> 00:37:57,179
binary interaction so if you put a

1013
00:37:55,199 --> 00:37:59,879
commensal in a pathogenic pseudomonas on

1014
00:37:57,179 --> 00:38:02,699
the same plants do you get disease or

1015
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:05,940
can you protect from the pathogen and um

1016
00:38:02,699 --> 00:38:08,159
so this is into C3 our pathogen and

1017
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:10,260
we've Nicole found that many commensals

1018
00:38:08,159 --> 00:38:12,059
and many that are closely related to the

1019
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:12,900
pathogen so here's the pathogen on our

1020
00:38:12,059 --> 00:38:15,059
tree

1021
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:17,639
and then this closely related commensal

1022
00:38:15,059 --> 00:38:19,320
if you mix them on Plants

1023
00:38:17,639 --> 00:38:21,480
um actually the commensal wins and so

1024
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:24,359
they protect against the pathogens this

1025
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:26,159
isn't true for all commensals so this is

1026
00:38:24,358 --> 00:38:27,960
um another clade of pseudomonas

1027
00:38:26,159 --> 00:38:29,578
fluorescence here and if you mix those

1028
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:32,099
they actually don't protect against the

1029
00:38:29,579 --> 00:38:33,660
pathogen and so

1030
00:38:32,099 --> 00:38:35,640
um this suggests that

1031
00:38:33,659 --> 00:38:37,440
either some of the commensals can

1032
00:38:35,639 --> 00:38:39,719
out-compete with the pathogen or kill

1033
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:42,539
the passion or the plants actually can

1034
00:38:39,719 --> 00:38:44,699
somehow enrich for just the commensals

1035
00:38:42,539 --> 00:38:46,619
and not the pathogen

1036
00:38:44,699 --> 00:38:48,838
um and so we first tried to see if there

1037
00:38:46,619 --> 00:38:50,640
was direct antagonism so can the

1038
00:38:48,838 --> 00:38:53,820
protective commensals directly kill the

1039
00:38:50,639 --> 00:38:55,799
pathogen or inhibit their virulence

1040
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:57,480
um and so we did a bunch of in vitro

1041
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:59,760
antagonism tests and we couldn't find

1042
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:01,440
any evidence of direct killing

1043
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:03,780
um this is also a quorum quenching assay

1044
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:06,000
because our pathogen uses a quorum

1045
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:08,040
dependent virulence mechanism and the

1046
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:10,619
commensal can't quench the the Quorum

1047
00:39:08,039 --> 00:39:12,239
signal of the pathogen

1048
00:39:10,619 --> 00:39:13,740
um and so that starts to make us think

1049
00:39:12,239 --> 00:39:16,139
that maybe it's something about the

1050
00:39:13,739 --> 00:39:17,939
plant so either the commensal is just

1051
00:39:16,139 --> 00:39:19,618
more fit and growing in plant root

1052
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:22,740
exudates or the plants can actually

1053
00:39:19,619 --> 00:39:24,720
detect the pathogen and kill it and not

1054
00:39:22,739 --> 00:39:26,279
the commence

1055
00:39:24,719 --> 00:39:28,259
um and so this is recent work that we've

1056
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:30,240
just posted a preprint uh from David

1057
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:31,380
Toms who's a postdoc in the lab that

1058
00:39:30,239 --> 00:39:32,699
just started his whole Lab at Florida

1059
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:36,539
State

1060
00:39:32,699 --> 00:39:38,338
um and so he uh sort of asked if the

1061
00:39:36,539 --> 00:39:40,380
commensalem pathogen

1062
00:39:38,338 --> 00:39:42,480
um could if there were differences in

1063
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:44,880
kinetics and vitro versus in Vivo so

1064
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:46,980
again asking is it plant specific

1065
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:49,079
he found that when he competed the

1066
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:51,358
pathogen and commensal in vitro so our

1067
00:39:49,079 --> 00:39:54,420
commensalism gray the pathogen is in

1068
00:39:51,358 --> 00:39:56,940
blue so in vitro they always grow at the

1069
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:59,280
same rate and so this is just total uh

1070
00:39:56,940 --> 00:40:01,139
bacterial growth in monoculture and then

1071
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:03,720
pathogen and commensal

1072
00:40:01,139 --> 00:40:06,420
um have the same final OD and very

1073
00:40:03,719 --> 00:40:07,799
similar growth kinetics when competing

1074
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:10,200
in culture

1075
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:12,720
however in plantsa our commensal always

1076
00:40:10,199 --> 00:40:15,239
wins and so here's the commensal in Gray

1077
00:40:12,719 --> 00:40:16,980
and the pathogen in blue and so this

1078
00:40:15,239 --> 00:40:19,979
suggests that the competition is indeed

1079
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:22,380
plant dependence and again can either be

1080
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:24,838
plants immune related or just that the

1081
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:27,000
commensal is better able to to colonize

1082
00:40:24,838 --> 00:40:28,619
plant roots

1083
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,338
um and so David wondered

1084
00:40:28,619 --> 00:40:31,440
um

1085
00:40:29,338 --> 00:40:33,599
first decided to test could the plant

1086
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:36,900
distinguish these and he used immunity

1087
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:39,240
reporters so these are immune inducible

1088
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:41,579
genes And the reporter lines developed

1089
00:40:39,239 --> 00:40:43,858
by Nico gilner's lab and so they're

1090
00:40:41,579 --> 00:40:46,140
nuclear localized transcriptional

1091
00:40:43,858 --> 00:40:49,559
reporters that are turned on in response

1092
00:40:46,139 --> 00:40:50,098
to mamps and Vamps primarily so

1093
00:40:49,559 --> 00:40:52,380
um

1094
00:40:50,099 --> 00:40:54,119
David asked if the commensal and

1095
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:56,338
pathogen could activate these reporters

1096
00:40:54,119 --> 00:40:58,200
and found that only the commensal could

1097
00:40:56,338 --> 00:40:59,699
activate or sorry only the pathogen

1098
00:40:58,199 --> 00:41:02,399
could activate the reporters so that's

1099
00:40:59,699 --> 00:41:04,379
here with these blue dots

1100
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:06,480
um so this indeed suggests that the

1101
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:10,160
plant can detect or distinguish the

1102
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:10,159
pathogen from the commensal

1103
00:41:11,159 --> 00:41:15,059
um so the next question is how could

1104
00:41:12,719 --> 00:41:18,419
that happen so both strains have similar

1105
00:41:15,059 --> 00:41:19,679
maps they're 99 identical by 16s they

1106
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:22,019
actually have the same flagellin

1107
00:41:19,679 --> 00:41:24,299
sequence all of their peptidoglycan

1108
00:41:22,019 --> 00:41:26,880
biosynthesis genes look you know

1109
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:28,859
indistinguishable as far as we can tell

1110
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:31,260
um so it seems unlikely they could tell

1111
00:41:28,858 --> 00:41:32,819
them apart by Maps also our pathogen

1112
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:35,400
doesn't even have a type 2 secretion

1113
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:36,599
system so the effectors are not likely

1114
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:39,180
candidates

1115
00:41:36,599 --> 00:41:41,400
and so we're really interested in in how

1116
00:41:39,179 --> 00:41:44,719
the plant is able to sense the pathogen

1117
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:44,720
and mount this immune response

1118
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:50,520
um and so uh as I mentioned if we sort

1119
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:52,500
of return to our classic Paradigm of

1120
00:41:50,519 --> 00:41:54,480
immunity implants you have type 3

1121
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:57,420
secretion where plants could recognize

1122
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:59,760
the effectors or the um or the

1123
00:41:57,420 --> 00:42:02,280
consequences of those effectors but our

1124
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:02,880
pathogen doesn't have effectors

1125
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:05,760
um

1126
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:07,440
they also can recognize maps and mounts

1127
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:09,780
immune response but our maps are

1128
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:12,179
probably very similar and so it seems

1129
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:13,859
that that's unlikely I think damage is

1130
00:42:12,179 --> 00:42:15,598
our probably our best bet because these

1131
00:42:13,858 --> 00:42:18,059
are performing toxins and so they can

1132
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:19,320
cause damage uh to the plant cell and

1133
00:42:18,059 --> 00:42:21,559
then maybe the plant could recognize

1134
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:21,559
that

1135
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:27,660
um so to start to get at the answer to

1136
00:42:24,239 --> 00:42:30,059
this um David started looking at um

1137
00:42:27,659 --> 00:42:31,739
at what genes were responsible for this

1138
00:42:30,059 --> 00:42:33,239
immune response and so now I'm showing

1139
00:42:31,739 --> 00:42:35,159
you instead of a transcriptional

1140
00:42:33,239 --> 00:42:37,199
reporter a reactive oxygen burst so

1141
00:42:35,159 --> 00:42:41,159
another readout for immunity

1142
00:42:37,199 --> 00:42:43,199
um where we have a um a die that when

1143
00:42:41,159 --> 00:42:46,379
oxidized so the presence of reactive

1144
00:42:43,199 --> 00:42:48,059
oxygen is luminescence and so you get a

1145
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:50,640
peak when you get a reactive oxygen

1146
00:42:48,059 --> 00:42:51,960
burst and an immune response and so if

1147
00:42:50,639 --> 00:42:54,420
you had flagellin you get a strong

1148
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:56,039
reactive oxygen burst if you add our

1149
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:58,858
pathogen and commensal you actually get

1150
00:42:56,039 --> 00:43:01,739
a weaker but still prominent reactive

1151
00:42:58,858 --> 00:43:04,318
oxygen burst and then this is just our

1152
00:43:01,739 --> 00:43:06,479
our Baseline mock treatments

1153
00:43:04,318 --> 00:43:09,000
um and so David asked

1154
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:11,159
um are there any plant genes in sensing

1155
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:13,980
of mamps or damage that are responsible

1156
00:43:11,159 --> 00:43:16,259
for this reactive oxygen burst

1157
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:18,420
um and so the idea that if this is a map

1158
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:19,800
response like a response to flagellin if

1159
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:22,920
you knock out

1160
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:25,500
um uh components of PTI and so we used a

1161
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:28,318
back one bkk1 Cirque one triple mutant

1162
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:30,539
which is a number of co-receptors for

1163
00:43:28,318 --> 00:43:33,900
mamp and damp signaling

1164
00:43:30,539 --> 00:43:36,420
um we can see if this response goes away

1165
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:40,440
and so first I'm showing you

1166
00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:44,039
um the commensal with the wild type or

1167
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:45,780
the triple back one bkk1 Cirque 1 mutant

1168
00:43:44,039 --> 00:43:48,539
um and so if you add flagellin you get

1169
00:43:45,780 --> 00:43:50,220
this peak but then in the back once bkk1

1170
00:43:48,539 --> 00:43:53,460
Cirque one mutant it's down here at the

1171
00:43:50,219 --> 00:43:54,838
bottom the response completely goes away

1172
00:43:53,460 --> 00:43:57,179
um and then our commensal you get this

1173
00:43:54,838 --> 00:43:59,338
peak in blue and the response again like

1174
00:43:57,179 --> 00:44:01,318
flagellin completely went away in the

1175
00:43:59,338 --> 00:44:02,759
triple mutants suggesting the reactive

1176
00:44:01,318 --> 00:44:04,980
oxygen burst we're seeing to the

1177
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:06,359
commensal is likely due to the presence

1178
00:44:04,980 --> 00:44:08,579
of things like flagellin or

1179
00:44:06,358 --> 00:44:10,139
peptidoglycan in our in our inoculation

1180
00:44:08,579 --> 00:44:12,839
perhaps

1181
00:44:10,139 --> 00:44:15,598
however when David did this with the

1182
00:44:12,838 --> 00:44:18,239
pathogen we saw a decrease but not a

1183
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:20,579
complete loss of immune response and so

1184
00:44:18,239 --> 00:44:22,739
again flagellin and gray the commensal

1185
00:44:20,579 --> 00:44:26,099
is in red and we see a decrease in the

1186
00:44:22,739 --> 00:44:27,959
response in the back one uh in the BBC

1187
00:44:26,099 --> 00:44:29,818
triple mutant but it doesn't go down to

1188
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:31,440
Baseline so that suggests a little bit

1189
00:44:29,818 --> 00:44:33,838
of the response is likely because of

1190
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:36,480
maps and then a secondary part of the

1191
00:44:33,838 --> 00:44:38,159
response is independent of myths and I

1192
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:39,960
wanted to highlight that the back one is

1193
00:44:38,159 --> 00:44:42,299
a co-receptor for a number of the damage

1194
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:43,980
receptors but not all of them so it does

1195
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:47,460
sort of rule out a subset of damage

1196
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:48,960
responses but not damaged completely

1197
00:44:47,460 --> 00:44:51,179
um and so this suggests that pathogens

1198
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:54,059
or plants can distinguish pathogens from

1199
00:44:51,179 --> 00:44:56,159
commensals they can sense the commensals

1200
00:44:54,059 --> 00:44:58,920
through mips and they can sense the

1201
00:44:56,159 --> 00:45:01,338
pathogen through a second independent

1202
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:01,338
process

1203
00:45:02,519 --> 00:45:07,920
um so we can see that the present or the

1204
00:45:04,519 --> 00:45:10,800
response is Toxin dependent and so this

1205
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:13,619
is again looking at gene expression now

1206
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:16,619
through qpcr instead of a reporter and

1207
00:45:13,619 --> 00:45:18,358
if you treat plants with uh

1208
00:45:16,619 --> 00:45:21,318
um these are two separate reporters so

1209
00:45:18,358 --> 00:45:25,019
mid 51 and pr5 which are both uh

1210
00:45:21,318 --> 00:45:28,139
immunity PTI responsive genes

1211
00:45:25,019 --> 00:45:30,900
our pathogen induces a response you can

1212
00:45:28,139 --> 00:45:32,940
see pep one which is a damage

1213
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:35,099
um Associated molecular pattern also

1214
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:36,780
induces a strong response and these

1215
00:45:35,099 --> 00:45:39,420
responses are decreased in the

1216
00:45:36,780 --> 00:45:40,740
swingomycin stringopeptin mutant and so

1217
00:45:39,420 --> 00:45:43,920
this suggests that the plants are

1218
00:45:40,739 --> 00:45:45,479
detecting the um the toxin or the

1219
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:47,700
consequences of the toxin the damage

1220
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:49,740
from the toxin to Mountain immune

1221
00:45:47,699 --> 00:45:51,598
response

1222
00:45:49,739 --> 00:45:52,219
um and so we think that

1223
00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:56,160
um

1224
00:45:52,219 --> 00:45:58,799
for commensals in the resosphere plants

1225
00:45:56,159 --> 00:46:02,338
can distinguish pathogens but they may

1226
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:04,980
not rely on PTI or ETI to do so because

1227
00:46:02,338 --> 00:46:08,039
we haven't found any role for those in

1228
00:46:04,980 --> 00:46:09,599
responding to our our pathogen so it

1229
00:46:08,039 --> 00:46:11,400
seems like they're responding to the

1230
00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:16,160
toxins or potentially the damage those

1231
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:16,160
toxins cause to melt an immune response

1232
00:46:17,039 --> 00:46:22,199
um and so to sort of uh summarize what

1233
00:46:20,099 --> 00:46:23,760
I've told you I've shown you that small

1234
00:46:22,199 --> 00:46:25,618
genomic changes over a very short

1235
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:27,720
evolutionary distances can result in

1236
00:46:25,619 --> 00:46:29,460
really dramatic lifestyle differences in

1237
00:46:27,719 --> 00:46:31,199
bacteria

1238
00:46:29,460 --> 00:46:32,639
um and that plants have mechanisms to

1239
00:46:31,199 --> 00:46:35,159
kind of sense their environments and

1240
00:46:32,639 --> 00:46:36,659
then enrich for beneficial microbes but

1241
00:46:35,159 --> 00:46:38,399
then we think that when you're reaching

1242
00:46:36,659 --> 00:46:40,500
for beneficial microbes you have a ways

1243
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:43,260
need to have a way to avoid also

1244
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:46,260
enriching for pathogens and so to do

1245
00:46:43,260 --> 00:46:49,020
that plants can potentially sense toxins

1246
00:46:46,260 --> 00:46:50,640
or damage causing molecules and then

1247
00:46:49,019 --> 00:46:52,199
hopefully you know we're thinking that

1248
00:46:50,639 --> 00:46:54,659
they can mount an immune response

1249
00:46:52,199 --> 00:46:56,759
specifically to Target those I think a

1250
00:46:54,659 --> 00:46:58,440
really open question there is you know

1251
00:46:56,760 --> 00:46:59,940
can they actually Target their immune

1252
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:04,579
response to just the cells where those

1253
00:46:59,940 --> 00:47:04,579
pathogens would be and causing damage

1254
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:09,960
um and so we are starting to think that

1255
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:12,358
plants can regulate the microbiome uh

1256
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:15,720
right by sensing

1257
00:47:12,358 --> 00:47:17,098
um uh damage or toxins rather than Maps

1258
00:47:15,719 --> 00:47:19,379
um and I think you know this has some

1259
00:47:17,099 --> 00:47:21,119
overlaps with the paradigms of immunity

1260
00:47:19,380 --> 00:47:23,818
that I learned in my Plant Pathology

1261
00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:26,099
class uh many years ago

1262
00:47:23,818 --> 00:47:28,019
um and uh and certainly damage and

1263
00:47:26,099 --> 00:47:30,300
damage responses have some overlap with

1264
00:47:28,019 --> 00:47:32,639
PCI but I think we really haven't

1265
00:47:30,300 --> 00:47:34,920
considered you know what immunity looks

1266
00:47:32,639 --> 00:47:38,219
like in Roots uh you know

1267
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:40,500
um and given that all of these uh

1268
00:47:38,219 --> 00:47:42,779
members of the microbiome have similar

1269
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:44,099
maps they may not have effectors I think

1270
00:47:42,780 --> 00:47:46,440
we need to start thinking about maybe

1271
00:47:44,099 --> 00:47:47,760
some some new paradigms so how is it

1272
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:50,519
that plants could actually sense and

1273
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:53,540
regulate uh commensals to result in a

1274
00:47:50,519 --> 00:47:53,539
community that's beneficial

1275
00:47:53,699 --> 00:47:58,078
um okay so with that I'd like to thank

1276
00:47:55,858 --> 00:47:59,699
the folks in the lab that um did the

1277
00:47:58,079 --> 00:48:01,920
work so I tried to highlight people as I

1278
00:47:59,699 --> 00:48:04,379
went uh the first story is the work of

1279
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:07,200
Ryan Melnick a former postdoc

1280
00:48:04,380 --> 00:48:08,460
um the ferronia story is the work of of

1281
00:48:07,199 --> 00:48:10,500
You song

1282
00:48:08,460 --> 00:48:13,019
um another former postdoc and then

1283
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:15,300
Nicole Wang and David Toms

1284
00:48:13,019 --> 00:48:17,338
um worked on sort of The Last Story on

1285
00:48:15,300 --> 00:48:19,380
the how plants can distinguish pathogens

1286
00:48:17,338 --> 00:48:20,639
from commensals and of course our

1287
00:48:19,380 --> 00:48:23,660
funding and I would be very happy to

1288
00:48:20,639 --> 00:48:23,659
answer any questions

1289
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:31,019
yeah okay so if you if you if you find a

1290
00:48:28,139 --> 00:48:34,019
way to transfer the two classes from

1291
00:48:31,019 --> 00:48:37,759
pencils into the pathogen would you

1292
00:48:34,019 --> 00:48:40,739
predict the pathogen will lose

1293
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:42,839
yeah I really want to do those

1294
00:48:40,739 --> 00:48:45,299
experiments and these islands are huge

1295
00:48:42,838 --> 00:48:46,739
so they've been hard to move around

1296
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:49,200
um but yeah I think we would predict

1297
00:48:46,739 --> 00:48:51,598
just based on the genomic sequence that

1298
00:48:49,199 --> 00:48:53,578
that the islands are incompatible in the

1299
00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:55,559
same genome and so if you tried to put

1300
00:48:53,579 --> 00:48:57,539
them all together they'd be lost what

1301
00:48:55,559 --> 00:48:59,400
could be driving that I don't know

1302
00:48:57,539 --> 00:49:01,380
um it may just be functional redundancy

1303
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:04,318
so if both the single mice and strangle

1304
00:49:01,380 --> 00:49:05,818
pepsin and dapg or antifungal then maybe

1305
00:49:04,318 --> 00:49:07,679
you just don't need both and so they're

1306
00:49:05,818 --> 00:49:09,358
lost over time but I don't think that's

1307
00:49:07,679 --> 00:49:11,460
a strong enough selection pressure to

1308
00:49:09,358 --> 00:49:14,039
explain the really dramatic pattern we

1309
00:49:11,460 --> 00:49:15,900
see and amazingly we've we've started

1310
00:49:14,039 --> 00:49:18,059
looking for this pattern now and we've

1311
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:19,858
seen it with many other Gene clusters

1312
00:49:18,059 --> 00:49:22,440
and so I think the most prominent

1313
00:49:19,858 --> 00:49:23,759
example is with um polyamine

1314
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:25,559
biosynthesis there's just small mole

1315
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:28,859
molecules that are involved in signaling

1316
00:49:25,559 --> 00:49:31,440
in bacteria there's two Pathways for

1317
00:49:28,858 --> 00:49:33,779
spermidine biosynthesis that have been

1318
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:37,139
described and pseudomonas all of them

1319
00:49:33,780 --> 00:49:39,359
have one but not both and we see gain

1320
00:49:37,139 --> 00:49:41,098
and loss over short distances so I think

1321
00:49:39,358 --> 00:49:42,420
we want to do that experiment with those

1322
00:49:41,099 --> 00:49:44,460
islands because they're smaller and

1323
00:49:42,420 --> 00:49:46,800
easier to move around and then we can

1324
00:49:44,460 --> 00:49:48,960
also select for them with ability to to

1325
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:50,640
break down polyamines but yeah we've

1326
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:52,380
gotten really interested in like what

1327
00:49:50,639 --> 00:49:55,139
could be driving these patterns because

1328
00:49:52,380 --> 00:49:57,599
it doesn't it seems too striking to just

1329
00:49:55,139 --> 00:49:59,039
be kind of a you know you you get one

1330
00:49:57,599 --> 00:50:00,780
and then you kind of lose the other over

1331
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:03,059
time it seems like there needs to be

1332
00:50:00,780 --> 00:50:06,060
active counter selection for one of them

1333
00:50:03,059 --> 00:50:06,059
good

1334
00:50:06,780 --> 00:50:12,720
um yeah I'm really curious um

1335
00:50:09,358 --> 00:50:17,159
we brought with suppressive soil

1336
00:50:12,719 --> 00:50:19,259
phenomenon where the damage signal or a

1337
00:50:17,159 --> 00:50:22,139
second or some kind of pathogen being

1338
00:50:19,260 --> 00:50:24,780
allow for enrichment

1339
00:50:22,139 --> 00:50:28,920
sorry go ahead sorry so I'm I'm curious

1340
00:50:24,780 --> 00:50:31,440
if you've ever seen a case where a

1341
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:34,619
commensal or mutualist kind of mimics

1342
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:37,559
this pathogen signal especially given

1343
00:50:34,619 --> 00:50:39,300
the fast genomic data sets of some of

1344
00:50:37,559 --> 00:50:43,139
the pseudomona species if you can see

1345
00:50:39,300 --> 00:50:45,119
like say a Ralph mimicking protein or

1346
00:50:43,139 --> 00:50:46,739
something is being expressed by a

1347
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:49,019
peninsula so it seems like it'd be a

1348
00:50:46,739 --> 00:50:52,379
huge fitness advantage and kind of like

1349
00:50:49,019 --> 00:50:56,099
a 2d past fashion yeah so I guess you're

1350
00:50:52,380 --> 00:50:59,880
asking in in maybe in just pseudomonas

1351
00:50:56,099 --> 00:51:02,039
or in commensal fungi uh if they make

1352
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:03,539
Ralphs like peptides yeah I haven't

1353
00:51:02,039 --> 00:51:05,639
looked um but that's a great question

1354
00:51:03,539 --> 00:51:07,380
because it seems like commensal fungi

1355
00:51:05,639 --> 00:51:10,259
would also benefit from you know

1356
00:51:07,380 --> 00:51:12,780
suppressing the J pathway maybe a little

1357
00:51:10,260 --> 00:51:15,140
bit uh yeah that's a good question I

1358
00:51:12,780 --> 00:51:15,140
haven't left

1359
00:51:15,539 --> 00:51:20,099
um so do you think it's horizontal

1360
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:22,079
transfer for these islands yeah so we

1361
00:51:20,099 --> 00:51:23,880
have been able so the question is

1362
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:26,280
um the gain and loss of the islands is

1363
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:28,440
it through horizontal Gene transfer

1364
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:30,720
um and it is um and it seems like it's

1365
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:32,519
horizontal Gene transfer followed by uh

1366
00:51:30,719 --> 00:51:34,618
homologous recombination

1367
00:51:32,519 --> 00:51:37,259
um and so we can see a few instances

1368
00:51:34,619 --> 00:51:40,200
um this is in our in the paper that uh

1369
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:41,760
there's uh the island is more similar to

1370
00:51:40,199 --> 00:51:43,558
the island in a distantly related

1371
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:47,520
species than

1372
00:51:43,559 --> 00:51:49,680
um you know then the rest of the genome

1373
00:51:47,519 --> 00:51:51,000
I guess or then sorry more closely

1374
00:51:49,679 --> 00:51:53,098
related to distantly related species

1375
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:55,318
than to closely related strains and we

1376
00:51:53,099 --> 00:51:57,539
can even find examples where the island

1377
00:51:55,318 --> 00:51:59,699
has been lost leading behind a legion of

1378
00:51:57,539 --> 00:52:01,619
homologous from combination and the

1379
00:51:59,699 --> 00:52:03,480
inside of the genes right where it's

1380
00:52:01,619 --> 00:52:05,338
recombined are more similar to a

1381
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:07,019
distantly related stream and then the

1382
00:52:05,338 --> 00:52:08,759
other Gene is more closely related to

1383
00:52:07,019 --> 00:52:10,679
closely related strains so we can even

1384
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:12,800
see like it's happened recently enough

1385
00:52:10,679 --> 00:52:15,480
that we can see we can trace the

1386
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:17,039
inheritance and make Gene trees of the

1387
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:18,719
genes in the island and the neighboring

1388
00:52:17,039 --> 00:52:21,719
genes and see that they're moving around

1389
00:52:18,719 --> 00:52:23,818
yeah so you think it's like some sort of

1390
00:52:21,719 --> 00:52:25,379
Integrative conjugate development is

1391
00:52:23,818 --> 00:52:27,300
that like composite or is it

1392
00:52:25,380 --> 00:52:28,559
extracellular and it's transforming into

1393
00:52:27,300 --> 00:52:30,539
the bacteria we think it's just

1394
00:52:28,559 --> 00:52:33,300
homologous recombination so there's no

1395
00:52:30,539 --> 00:52:35,279
evidence of transposon or like phage or

1396
00:52:33,300 --> 00:52:37,619
anything else um whether it's you know

1397
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:39,839
conjugation followed by homologous

1398
00:52:37,619 --> 00:52:42,059
combination or transformation we think

1399
00:52:39,838 --> 00:52:45,599
it's probably conjugation because

1400
00:52:42,059 --> 00:52:47,519
there's no evidence of phage uh and then

1401
00:52:45,599 --> 00:52:49,318
pseudomonas are just not very naturally

1402
00:52:47,519 --> 00:52:51,780
competence but they

1403
00:52:49,318 --> 00:52:53,759
um conjugate really readily so but we

1404
00:52:51,780 --> 00:52:55,160
can't tell how DNA is getting in but

1405
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:58,559
once it's there it's about

1406
00:52:55,159 --> 00:53:00,299
sorry one last but have you sort of

1407
00:52:58,559 --> 00:53:03,839
trolled through other metagenomic

1408
00:53:00,300 --> 00:53:05,760
databases looking for similar islands

1409
00:53:03,838 --> 00:53:07,679
that might have transferred to more

1410
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:10,319
distant

1411
00:53:07,679 --> 00:53:12,480
yeah that's a good question so um I

1412
00:53:10,318 --> 00:53:15,239
think David uh post office just started

1413
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:16,440
his own lab is really interested in that

1414
00:53:15,239 --> 00:53:19,558
so

1415
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:21,659
um toxins in general are so common in

1416
00:53:19,559 --> 00:53:23,940
bacteria and some of them are probably

1417
00:53:21,659 --> 00:53:25,980
for you know inter-microbial Warfare and

1418
00:53:23,940 --> 00:53:27,599
some of them are probably for hosts

1419
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:30,358
um and there are some examples like

1420
00:53:27,599 --> 00:53:32,039
within bacillus of toxins moving around

1421
00:53:30,358 --> 00:53:33,539
over

1422
00:53:32,039 --> 00:53:34,619
um short distances just when we look in

1423
00:53:33,539 --> 00:53:36,239
the genome

1424
00:53:34,619 --> 00:53:37,980
um but yeah I think there's enough of

1425
00:53:36,239 --> 00:53:40,199
these toxins that actually could explain

1426
00:53:37,980 --> 00:53:42,858
some of the the differences in host

1427
00:53:40,199 --> 00:53:42,858
association between

1428
00:53:43,260 --> 00:53:48,119
this one is limited to pseudomonas

1429
00:53:45,900 --> 00:53:50,760
um it's a poor forming toxin so there's

1430
00:53:48,119 --> 00:53:53,760
many other performing toxins that work

1431
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:55,800
through a similar mechanism but are not

1432
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:57,660
thank you so much so good to ask one

1433
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:59,099
question that came from Geneva it says

1434
00:53:57,659 --> 00:54:00,659
thank you for an excellent talk I'm

1435
00:53:59,099 --> 00:54:04,920
curious how you captured these beautiful

1436
00:54:00,659 --> 00:54:08,818
images of the erebalances rhizosphere

1437
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:12,000
um so I think maybe do you mean the you

1438
00:54:08,818 --> 00:54:14,279
probably can't uh answer but maybe these

1439
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:15,659
images from David on the immune

1440
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:18,720
recorders

1441
00:54:15,659 --> 00:54:21,239
um if if so that we just have a

1442
00:54:18,719 --> 00:54:24,058
um it's a Flash and stereoscope

1443
00:54:21,239 --> 00:54:25,799
um that is actually not that expensive

1444
00:54:24,059 --> 00:54:28,019
um that David was able to image these

1445
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:30,300
reporters on so

1446
00:54:28,019 --> 00:54:34,280
yeah David's a cell biologist by

1447
00:54:30,300 --> 00:54:34,280
training so that's a lot of that is

1448
00:54:34,380 --> 00:54:38,480
great well thank you very much um
