1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:04,320
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:17,240
University well thank you Neil

3
00:00:12,558 --> 00:00:19,559
uh as Neil mentioned I had retired just

4
00:00:17,239 --> 00:00:22,278
as a personal thought modern technology

5
00:00:19,559 --> 00:00:24,598
really messes up

6
00:00:22,278 --> 00:00:27,599
retirements people can find

7
00:00:24,599 --> 00:00:29,599
me over the Internet whatever and a

8
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:31,679
number of questions that get asked and

9
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:34,079
pretty much the questions end

10
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:36,840
up falling into certain specific

11
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:39,640
categories like aquaculture or

12
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:43,200
LEDs and one that's really a popular

13
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:45,840
question relates to Urban farming and

14
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:50,199
particularly the old favorites in urban

15
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:53,760
farming um skyscraper

16
00:00:50,198 --> 00:00:56,878
Farms or abandoned warehouses there's a

17
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:59,718
real fascination with abandoned

18
00:00:56,878 --> 00:01:01,039
warehouses and when I've you first got

19
00:00:59,719 --> 00:01:02,359
these questions I began to think you

20
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:04,719
know this some of this doesn't make

21
00:01:02,359 --> 00:01:06,478
sense does it really make sense so try

22
00:01:04,719 --> 00:01:08,000
to put some numbers with it and that's

23
00:01:06,478 --> 00:01:10,519
what I'm going to do today is go through

24
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,920
just simple calculation simple ways that

25
00:01:10,519 --> 00:01:16,239
a technical person should look at some

26
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:19,920
of these ideas and at the end of it make

27
00:01:16,239 --> 00:01:22,919
up your own mind I don't have a specific

28
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,920
agenda

29
00:01:23,239 --> 00:01:28,919
our thank you for saying

30
00:01:25,719 --> 00:01:30,759
it anyway trying to put numbers try to

31
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:33,118
put some logic to the

32
00:01:30,759 --> 00:01:35,438
question of is urban farming in this

33
00:01:33,118 --> 00:01:37,118
kind of a system worthwhile and what

34
00:01:35,438 --> 00:01:40,118
really characterizes these systems is

35
00:01:37,118 --> 00:01:42,759
the dependence on artificial

36
00:01:40,118 --> 00:01:44,680
supplemental light nons

37
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:47,280
sunlight so we're talking about Urban

38
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:49,640
plant factories sort of a generic term

39
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:53,759
for this very common are they high in

40
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:56,920
the sky or are they pie in the sky and I

41
00:01:53,759 --> 00:02:00,478
think will let you decide you're really

42
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:03,000
talking about skyscraper Farms you see

43
00:02:00,478 --> 00:02:04,200
these mentioned on the internet up to 60

44
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
stories

45
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:09,640
tall various crops grown in them the

46
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,479
more ambitious people try to grow trees

47
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:13,799
and

48
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:17,479
cows things like that in the

49
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:19,719
skyscraper the uh next one abandoned

50
00:02:17,479 --> 00:02:22,238
warehouses just love to fill abandoned

51
00:02:19,719 --> 00:02:23,519
warehouses with plants because what else

52
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:25,800
are you going to do with an abandoned

53
00:02:23,519 --> 00:02:28,599
warehouse one might guess tear it down

54
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:31,160
and start over but uh they want to use

55
00:02:28,598 --> 00:02:33,439
it over again and are they really is it

56
00:02:31,159 --> 00:02:35,318
an emperor wearing new clothes or not is

57
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:38,079
the

58
00:02:35,318 --> 00:02:40,318
question now there a lot of proposals a

59
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:44,560
lot of designs have been developed to

60
00:02:40,318 --> 00:02:47,479
show to create vertical Farm

61
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:49,759
facilities and it just it strikes me it

62
00:02:47,479 --> 00:02:52,878
must be enormous fun to be an architect

63
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:54,359
more fun than any other profession

64
00:02:52,878 --> 00:02:55,560
because you can invent these things that

65
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:57,400
don't have to do

66
00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:00,439
anything but you can let your

67
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:02,280
imagination flow

68
00:03:00,439 --> 00:03:05,120
and some of the

69
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:07,000
ideas on the roof but also in the

70
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,519
building and other these are all

71
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,639
architectural drawings they're not for

72
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:15,319
real or big skyscraper like this or one

73
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:17,479
like this or this one you can't read the

74
00:03:15,318 --> 00:03:19,958
icons but they talk about what can be

75
00:03:17,479 --> 00:03:23,518
grown there and that's say cherries

76
00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:25,920
peaches grapes fodder all sorts of

77
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:28,239
things that proposed to grow in there

78
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:32,518
this one is the plantagon in Sweden it's

79
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:35,080
a skyscraper they're trying to sell to

80
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:37,560
various cities or

81
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:39,719
municipalities it's a very tall 60 story

82
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:42,799
tall Skyscraper with

83
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:45,280
plants this is one is also a plantagon

84
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:48,159
it's a circular Greenhouse the plants

85
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:50,680
are put in one end and there's a ramp

86
00:03:48,158 --> 00:03:52,199
that circles up and the plant goes up or

87
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:55,360
else goes

88
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:57,359
down put on a seeds on one end harvested

89
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:59,840
crop on the other

90
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:02,560
end what makes this interesting is the

91
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:04,719
yanaga nation has I believe purchased a

92
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:07,360
significant portion of

93
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:11,359
their investment money put a lot into

94
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:15,079
this particular idea to sell these

95
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:17,280
things some of the more imaginative

96
00:04:15,079 --> 00:04:19,799
designs if you like something like this

97
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:21,078
is stacked Pebbles this is specifically

98
00:04:19,798 --> 00:04:24,120
designed to be a stacked Pebble

99
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:26,280
Greenhouse if you like that this one is

100
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:31,038
called the dragonfly for some

101
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:33,799
reason it's being very promoted

102
00:04:31,038 --> 00:04:37,079
for placement of one of these on

103
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:38,879
Roosevelt Island in New York City we

104
00:04:37,079 --> 00:04:42,198
know that's where Cornell is a Tech

105
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:45,800
campus I don't think there's a com any

106
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:49,000
reason for it but coincidence but that's

107
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:49,000
one of the more most

108
00:04:49,079 --> 00:04:53,839
imaginative so I want to go through a

109
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:56,560
number of things and talk about this

110
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:58,879
some background and vertical Farm

111
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,519
Concepts reality check on the crops that

112
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:02,680
can be growing because the crops that

113
00:05:00,519 --> 00:05:04,439
can be grown have been proposed I said

114
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:06,720
for all sorts of things and one of the

115
00:05:04,439 --> 00:05:09,079
primary motivations for some of the

116
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:11,600
enthusiasts is to return Farmland to the

117
00:05:09,079 --> 00:05:15,000
primordial state to get rid of all

118
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:18,400
farmland and grow of all of our crops in

119
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,160
vertical Farms cost comparison related

120
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:22,159
to photosynthetic Lighting in a vertical

121
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:25,199
Farm how much does it cost you to write

122
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:27,720
to to run 100% lights versus using the

123
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:30,439
sun um this one is the one that's the

124
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:32,039
untold story really and nobody seems to

125
00:05:30,439 --> 00:05:33,279
want to listen to it it's the how large

126
00:05:32,038 --> 00:05:36,800
is the carbon

127
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:41,198
footprint these concepts are motivated

128
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:42,918
by the desire to do away with food miles

129
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:45,319
the large carbon footprint associated

130
00:05:42,918 --> 00:05:47,719
with food miles so let's grow the plants

131
00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:50,160
locally let's grow them in an abandoned

132
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:53,000
warehouse it doesn't make

133
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:55,199
sense promising more efficient lighting

134
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,399
talk about LEDs a little bit talk about

135
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:58,680
renewable energy people say well I don't

136
00:05:57,399 --> 00:06:01,439
worry about electricity because I'm

137
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:04,680
going to put in PV panels let's look at

138
00:06:01,439 --> 00:06:06,439
that critically and see if it's possible

139
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:08,478
other ways to add light and these are

140
00:06:06,439 --> 00:06:11,439
all proposed flat mirrors concentrating

141
00:06:08,478 --> 00:06:14,399
mirrors light pipes fiber optics all

142
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:17,240
these high-tech ways of trans reflecting

143
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:19,679
carrying transmitting light look at

144
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:22,280
that and then I want to be a little bit

145
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:25,959
positive and end on the idea that there

146
00:06:22,279 --> 00:06:25,959
are some places where this might make

147
00:06:26,839 --> 00:06:31,279
sense all goes well questions and

148
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:34,400
discussion and notice I don't say

149
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:37,038
answers just questions and

150
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:38,318
discussion now the current book that you

151
00:06:37,038 --> 00:06:41,879
may have heard about is the vertical

152
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:44,080
Farm book by Dixon desier from Columbia

153
00:06:41,879 --> 00:06:46,598
University who's not a greenhouse person

154
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:48,959
at all he's a

155
00:06:46,598 --> 00:06:50,680
microbiologist and I have a number of

156
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:52,439
quotes several quotes from there some I

157
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:54,160
agree with and some I don't the first is

158
00:06:52,439 --> 00:06:55,879
we know how to proceed we can apply

159
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:58,080
Hydroponic and aeroponic farming

160
00:06:55,879 --> 00:07:01,240
methodologies to a multi-story building

161
00:06:58,079 --> 00:07:04,079
and create the world's first vertical

162
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:07,439
Farms I'm not sure we know how to

163
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:09,878
proceed but what what's Al a little bit

164
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:12,319
irritating is that the numbers he uses

165
00:07:09,879 --> 00:07:15,000
to promote his system are Unown numbers

166
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:15,000
applied

167
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:21,000
inappropriately this one I do agree with

168
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:23,239
should be cheap to build modular durable

169
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,399
easily maintained safe to operate

170
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:27,199
independent of economic subsidies and

171
00:07:25,399 --> 00:07:30,359
outside

172
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:32,680
support okay so that's important but he

173
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:36,000
admits that but he also says no

174
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:38,560
ecosystem can exceed the limits of Bio

175
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,319
whoops biomass production strictly

176
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,759
limited by the amount of incoming energy

177
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:45,520
and that means slight if you're growing

178
00:07:42,759 --> 00:07:48,000
a plants in a building heat is one thing

179
00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:49,959
but light is the really important first

180
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,120
part to think about so these are all

181
00:07:49,959 --> 00:07:57,000
those are things I agree with let's see

182
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:59,598
if it really is true in his design

183
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,439
now there's a lot of skepticism about

184
00:07:59,598 --> 00:08:04,279
this I'm not the only one in the

185
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:07,639
world uh a skeptical

186
00:08:04,279 --> 00:08:10,478
and growing plants in these different

187
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:15,199
facilities they doubt the

188
00:08:10,478 --> 00:08:18,439
practicality now this slide this picture

189
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:18,439
everybody know what this plant

190
00:08:19,158 --> 00:08:28,800
is lettuce head lettuce bib lettuce just

191
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:30,680
B year ago I got an email from he was

192
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,000
from Scranton Pennsylvania and I think

193
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:35,479
it's still going

194
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,958
on he had an abandoned warehouse and he'

195
00:08:35,479 --> 00:08:39,719
converted to Growing lettuce put some

196
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:42,199
skylights in the

197
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:44,640
roof this was his

198
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:47,560
crop and he asked me what nutritional

199
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:47,559
factor is at play

200
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:51,720
here I told him

201
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:59,519
manganese white obviously

202
00:08:57,078 --> 00:09:02,399
light but this is the kind of thing that

203
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:03,720
people don't make any real connection to

204
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:06,879
is the amount of light that a plant

205
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:08,959
needs because the plant is so linear

206
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:11,639
with respect to the light and the eye is

207
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:13,958
so nonlinear that you can see very well

208
00:09:11,639 --> 00:09:16,078
in a low light that will plant will

209
00:09:13,958 --> 00:09:17,559
barely at the compensation point the

210
00:09:16,078 --> 00:09:20,519
plan at a compensation way gets enough

211
00:09:17,559 --> 00:09:20,518
light that you can see very

212
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:29,440
well so tackling some of the doubts one

213
00:09:23,958 --> 00:09:31,759
at a time potential crops greens herbs

214
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:35,240
possible Vine crops small fruits tree

215
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:37,559
crops the next level of proposal wheat

216
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:41,278
corn soybeans the next level to return

217
00:09:37,559 --> 00:09:43,759
land to its primordial state is that

218
00:09:41,278 --> 00:09:46,639
possible let's look at the claim that

219
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:48,720
wheat is possible just pick that a crop

220
00:09:46,639 --> 00:09:52,439
at random let's look at the economic

221
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:54,800
viability of CA wheat production as a

222
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:58,600
metric well the world record for outdoor

223
00:09:54,799 --> 00:10:03,278
wheat production as one comparison done

224
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:05,440
in 2010 and New Zealand 233 bushels per

225
00:10:03,278 --> 00:10:08,078
acre Neil said I grew up on a farm in

226
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:10,920
Newfield I think that our acreage our

227
00:10:08,078 --> 00:10:13,719
yield was about 10% of

228
00:10:10,919 --> 00:10:16,838
this that much per acre this is the

229
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:18,600
record outdoor indoor the most I've seen

230
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:21,720
is work that's been done by Bruce bugby

231
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:24,278
and Frank Salsbury Utah State looking at

232
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:26,639
wheat production for NASA trying to push

233
00:10:24,278 --> 00:10:27,958
the limits how far can they go how much

234
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:29,958
light can they give it and how much

235
00:10:27,958 --> 00:10:31,759
growth can they get

236
00:10:29,958 --> 00:10:32,559
this was just the result that this was

237
00:10:31,759 --> 00:10:35,159
looking

238
00:10:32,559 --> 00:10:37,638
at wheat with three

239
00:10:35,159 --> 00:10:39,519
tillers primary secondary tertiary

240
00:10:37,639 --> 00:10:43,680
tillers this was the yield from each one

241
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:45,278
as a function of Daily Light integral

242
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:47,319
and I'll talk about Daily Light integral

243
00:10:45,278 --> 00:10:50,600
as you know in moles per square meter

244
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:52,560
per day or talk about light in general

245
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:54,680
is micro moles per meter squar per

246
00:10:52,559 --> 00:10:56,838
second adding these three together you

247
00:10:54,679 --> 00:10:59,519
get a line that looks like

248
00:10:56,839 --> 00:11:02,120
this the yield as a function of Daily

249
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:04,639
Light integral it goes up to 150 the

250
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:06,839
wheat is still increasing well what's

251
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:10,639
150 moles per square meter per day you

252
00:11:06,839 --> 00:11:14,760
have a good feeling for that

253
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:17,959
no this the maximum that's that I could

254
00:11:14,759 --> 00:11:17,958
find ever for itha was

255
00:11:18,559 --> 00:11:23,719
64 believe it or

256
00:11:20,839 --> 00:11:25,680
not this is 14 years of itha weather

257
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:28,639
data solar

258
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:30,559
data this is the daily moles per square

259
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:32,320
meter

260
00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:34,479
and this are the day of the

261
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:37,440
year and these are measured data from

262
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:38,800
the Corno weather station for 14 years

263
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:41,639
83 to

264
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:44,519
96 and you can see on this this bounding

265
00:11:41,639 --> 00:11:47,360
curve is outside the atmosphere and all

266
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:50,759
the little dots are individual

267
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:52,360
days pick flick 55 this is a good number

268
00:11:50,759 --> 00:11:54,360
to pick sort of in the middle of the

269
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:56,680
graph you can see it it is achievable

270
00:11:54,360 --> 00:12:00,560
this line is

271
00:11:56,679 --> 00:12:02,239
55 so it became my guess as a place to

272
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:04,359
make an analysis you know we're doing as

273
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:06,639
well as we'll do in itha just about any

274
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:09,440
day of the year better than

275
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:12,120
most starting April 20th ending August

276
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:13,720
8th is when you pass that maximum

277
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:18,639
possible at

278
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:22,040
55 so let's assume we will grow crops

279
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:25,079
within this greenhouse at 55 moles per

280
00:12:22,039 --> 00:12:28,120
square meter per day Daily Light

281
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:29,399
integral now I I tended to make going to

282
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:31,360
present a number of things in these sort

283
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:33,639
of flowcharts so I hope you like

284
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:35,839
flowcharts been told that it's easier to

285
00:12:33,639 --> 00:12:38,440
understand than a series of

286
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:40,320
equations so let's look at two

287
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:43,880
possibilities record field production

288
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:46,000
the 1.56 7 Etc yearly high intensity

289
00:12:43,879 --> 00:12:48,159
growth chamber they could do four crops

290
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:51,000
a year Bruce could do four it was a

291
00:12:48,159 --> 00:12:53,240
dwarf wheat too a very high intensity

292
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:56,759
production in a dwarf

293
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:57,959
wheat 2 kg of square meter per Harvest

294
00:12:56,759 --> 00:13:01,000
at

295
00:12:57,958 --> 00:13:03,359
55 but say we have four

296
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,679
harvests the four Harvest with the

297
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:07,440
high-intensity growth room get far more

298
00:13:05,679 --> 00:13:09,439
than the outdoor production so we'll

299
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:12,720
take for Harvest we'll assume we can

300
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:15,839
Harvest four times a year 8 kg per

301
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:19,560
square meter per year or 1.64 pounds per

302
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:21,600
square foot that's the best I thought we

303
00:13:19,559 --> 00:13:25,000
could probably do with

304
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:28,000
wheat what's the value of

305
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,958
wheat these are some a year old data but

306
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,120
I looked yesterday and the wheat prices

307
00:13:29,958 --> 00:13:33,518
have stayed very similar very consistent

308
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:37,879
over the

309
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:39,120
years um 12.2 cents a pound is the world

310
00:13:37,879 --> 00:13:42,278
wheat

311
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:45,320
price do that 12 half cents a pound time

312
00:13:42,278 --> 00:13:48,879
1.64 PB per square foot per year 20

313
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:48,879
cents per square foot per year is the

314
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:54,159
income will we replace outdoor

315
00:13:54,799 --> 00:13:59,719
agriculture it's gross in really you can

316
00:13:58,078 --> 00:14:01,239
anything that's a commodity you must

317
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:03,600
have something more valuable than any

318
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:06,320
commodity so corn wheat ETA are not

319
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:08,399
possible cannot replace outdoor

320
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:11,040
agriculture the same

321
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:14,919
is um answers come up if you look at

322
00:14:11,039 --> 00:14:17,319
wheat corn soybeans any of the commodity

323
00:14:14,919 --> 00:14:18,639
crops well that's one perspective is how

324
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:21,399
much income you get the other

325
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:23,519
perspective is the cost what's the cost

326
00:14:21,399 --> 00:14:25,799
of electricity to run this facility to

327
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:28,360
grow the wheat let's assume we have good

328
00:14:25,799 --> 00:14:31,000
efficient lighting High Press sodium

329
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:32,680
good LED

330
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,759
yearly income 20 cents per square foot

331
00:14:32,679 --> 00:14:36,599
what's the electricity

332
00:14:34,759 --> 00:14:38,000
bill rather than saying what's the

333
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:39,159
electricity bill I wanted to ask the

334
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,879
question what's the cost of the

335
00:14:39,159 --> 00:14:43,919
electricity to bake one loaf of bread to

336
00:14:41,879 --> 00:14:47,360
grow the wheat for one loaf of

337
00:14:43,919 --> 00:14:49,559
bread can relate to that we bake some

338
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:52,000
bread the things I learned doing this

339
00:14:49,559 --> 00:14:56,439
it's amazing never baked never baked

340
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,440
bread never ever baked bread in my

341
00:14:57,799 --> 00:15:06,879
life one 1 kgam of wheat 1.3 l of

342
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:08,159
kernels 2.6 L of flour cuz flour is a

343
00:15:06,879 --> 00:15:10,919
lot of

344
00:15:08,159 --> 00:15:12,000
airspace 3.7 loaves of bread out of 1

345
00:15:10,919 --> 00:15:14,919
kilogram of

346
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:17,159
wheat okay I hope everybody's taking

347
00:15:14,919 --> 00:15:17,159
this

348
00:15:18,879 --> 00:15:24,399
down

349
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:26,879
so 55 moles per square meter time 365

350
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:29,759
days 20,000 moles per square meter

351
00:15:26,879 --> 00:15:31,399
Cornell data for high pressure sodium we

352
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:33,639
did a test of eight different high

353
00:15:31,399 --> 00:15:36,559
pressure sodium lamps some years ago and

354
00:15:33,639 --> 00:15:41,799
generally got the number that we get

355
00:15:36,559 --> 00:15:44,958
four moles of light from a Luminaire

356
00:15:41,799 --> 00:15:47,318
four moles for every kilowatt hour that

357
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:49,399
went into it now these were 400 watt

358
00:15:47,318 --> 00:15:51,479
lights 600 would be slightly better

359
00:15:49,399 --> 00:15:53,799
1,000 slightly better but you're not

360
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:55,720
going to get above four so three seems

361
00:15:53,799 --> 00:15:59,359
to characterize a lot of the lighting

362
00:15:55,720 --> 00:16:01,839
and it characterizes LEDs

363
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:04,600
so we have 6667 kilowatt hours per

364
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:06,360
square meter per year let's assume the

365
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:11,000
electricity is 10 cents a kilowatt hour

366
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:13,919
it's depends $687 of cost per square

367
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:16,078
meter per year we have the productivity

368
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:18,639
we know 1 kilogram produces 3.7 loaves

369
00:16:16,078 --> 00:16:21,318
we can bake 29.6

370
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:26,360
loaves out of this square

371
00:16:21,318 --> 00:16:29,639
meter and we PID electric bill of $23 a

372
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:32,440
loaf I tended to pick generous

373
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:34,839
assumptions and even with the generous

374
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:38,360
assumptions at this point the $23 The

375
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:38,360
Vow if I get rather concerned I will

376
00:16:38,559 --> 00:16:43,879
say so Commodities won't

377
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:46,959
pay so look at a non-commodity crop look

378
00:16:43,879 --> 00:16:49,039
at in this case lettuce would use the

379
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:51,198
model as being the greenhouse that

380
00:16:49,039 --> 00:16:53,240
challenge Industries Runs Out by NYSEG

381
00:16:51,198 --> 00:16:56,159
it's the ca Greenhouse from several

382
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:59,120
years ago that was given to challenge by

383
00:16:56,159 --> 00:17:00,639
Cornell the productivity

384
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:04,279
at the time it was built we were

385
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:06,919
planning on 1245 heads per day from the

386
00:17:04,279 --> 00:17:08,279
system total heads per day I talked to

387
00:17:06,919 --> 00:17:09,520
the assistant manager a couple of weeks

388
00:17:08,279 --> 00:17:11,838
ago and he said he's been counting them

389
00:17:09,519 --> 00:17:14,318
and it's been about 1240 so it's not a

390
00:17:11,838 --> 00:17:17,119
bad assumption a couple get thrown out

391
00:17:14,318 --> 00:17:21,918
of course so we have that much and these

392
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:21,918
are 150 to 160 gr

393
00:17:22,318 --> 00:17:26,918
heads so what's the extra cost of total

394
00:17:25,038 --> 00:17:29,119
closure that's the greenhouse what

395
00:17:26,919 --> 00:17:31,240
happens if we totally close which means

396
00:17:29,119 --> 00:17:33,119
100% artificial light now people have

397
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:35,480
objected the concept of artificial light

398
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:37,959
because all light is real but it's a

399
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:37,960
term that's

400
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:43,319
used productivity 17 moles per square

401
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:44,720
meter per day that is the Daily Light

402
00:17:43,319 --> 00:17:46,079
integral that's imposed on the lettuce

403
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:49,400
to prevent tip

404
00:17:46,079 --> 00:17:51,759
burn and to maximize growth optimize

405
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:56,600
growth two possibilities 100%

406
00:17:51,759 --> 00:17:59,640
supplemental light or 30% why 30% well

407
00:17:56,599 --> 00:18:02,038
based on the data that we have over a

408
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:04,759
year that Greenhouse receives 70% of its

409
00:18:02,038 --> 00:18:09,599
light from the sun and even in

410
00:18:04,759 --> 00:18:12,279
itha 30% from

411
00:18:09,599 --> 00:18:14,000
electricity um we have the three moles

412
00:18:12,279 --> 00:18:16,399
per kilowatt hour of the

413
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,880
efficacy and I use the word efficacy

414
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:20,519
rather than efficiency because the units

415
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:23,320
are not the same top and

416
00:18:20,519 --> 00:18:26,480
bottom 689 kilowatt hours per square

417
00:18:23,319 --> 00:18:29,839
meter per year with the greenhouse 2068

418
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:33,440
with the closed system prod itivity as

419
00:18:29,839 --> 00:18:34,918
given before we get .91 kilowatt hours

420
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:40,320
per

421
00:18:34,919 --> 00:18:43,120
head from the greenhouse 2.72 from the

422
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:45,480
plant Factory so roughly two more than

423
00:18:43,119 --> 00:18:48,479
almost three times as much electricity

424
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:50,240
goes into the crop in a plant Factory as

425
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:53,240
it goes into

426
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,240
a

427
00:18:54,839 --> 00:19:00,079
greenhouse now the hydroponic production

428
00:18:57,319 --> 00:19:01,759
of lettuce challenge is getting by and

429
00:19:00,079 --> 00:19:04,199
some people are getting by but it's not

430
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:06,759
highly profitable there's no 30 40%

431
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:08,120
return on this stuff and tripling the

432
00:19:06,759 --> 00:19:10,279
kilowatt hours per head at 10 or

433
00:19:08,119 --> 00:19:14,239
whatever cents per head per kilowatt

434
00:19:10,279 --> 00:19:15,399
hour could be a problem and economically

435
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:20,440
but of course it all depends on the

436
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:20,440
market price right this is always comes

437
00:19:20,599 --> 00:19:26,279
back enthusiasts will say that it

438
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:28,079
depends on the market price and they

439
00:19:26,279 --> 00:19:29,639
have a special deal I've been told this

440
00:19:28,079 --> 00:19:31,599
so many times I have a a special

441
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:33,200
contract with the supermarkets that I'm

442
00:19:31,599 --> 00:19:35,879
going to get a good

443
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:38,080
price or the local market will support a

444
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:40,600
higher price because it's people who

445
00:19:38,079 --> 00:19:42,879
like to support locally grown food if

446
00:19:40,599 --> 00:19:44,319
think there's a place like that that

447
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:46,360
people pay a little extra for the

448
00:19:44,319 --> 00:19:47,639
challenge lettuce because they want to

449
00:19:46,359 --> 00:19:50,359
support the local

450
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:52,080
production or it has higher quality and

451
00:19:50,359 --> 00:19:54,719
therefore achieves a higher price these

452
00:19:52,079 --> 00:19:57,319
are the arguments that always come back

453
00:19:54,720 --> 00:20:00,480
and it's probably true there no question

454
00:19:57,319 --> 00:20:01,960
that these contentions are probably true

455
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:04,319
but there are some other factors outside

456
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:06,159
of the energy input that are

457
00:20:04,319 --> 00:20:08,319
important

458
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:09,919
so let's look at two two different

459
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:12,319
little asides and then we'll go back to

460
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:14,759
the important

461
00:20:12,319 --> 00:20:15,798
one everything I've shown so far is just

462
00:20:14,759 --> 00:20:18,000
been for

463
00:20:15,798 --> 00:20:22,519
lighting if you could imagine stacked

464
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:25,679
trays in a closed room being lit 20 24

465
00:20:22,519 --> 00:20:28,319
hours a day have a lot of heat no matter

466
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:30,640
whether they're LEDs or not have a lot

467
00:20:28,319 --> 00:20:30,639
of heat

468
00:20:30,679 --> 00:20:35,400
if you ventilate you can't use CO2 you

469
00:20:33,558 --> 00:20:37,798
have to ventilate a lot you have to get

470
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:39,480
rid of that heat in a greenhouse you

471
00:20:37,798 --> 00:20:41,400
have the fans and you have heat lost

472
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:43,919
through the structure so the energy

473
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:46,919
balance is a little different in a

474
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:48,840
greenhouse and in addition to which the

475
00:20:46,919 --> 00:20:51,038
air movement becomes a real problem when

476
00:20:48,839 --> 00:20:52,519
things are stacked one on top of the

477
00:20:51,038 --> 00:20:55,839
other what's also interesting in these

478
00:20:52,519 --> 00:20:59,480
pictures that advertise the plant

479
00:20:55,839 --> 00:21:01,319
factories always show fluorescent lights

480
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:05,159
because you know it's way to stack them

481
00:21:01,319 --> 00:21:08,399
in what's the least efficient way of

482
00:21:05,159 --> 00:21:11,559
lighting plants incandescent what's the

483
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:15,320
second least deficient fluorescent very

484
00:21:11,558 --> 00:21:17,720
inefficient very short lived not good at

485
00:21:15,319 --> 00:21:20,639
all the one on the left shows

486
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:22,400
LEDs it's a separate question we can

487
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:25,440
come back to

488
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:27,320
it additional points climates better

489
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:29,679
than Ithaca reduce the supplemental

490
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:31,079
light need by half I said the itha

491
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:33,798
greenhouse the finger legs fresh

492
00:21:31,079 --> 00:21:37,319
Greenhouse gets 30% of its light from

493
00:21:33,798 --> 00:21:39,158
the sun if you go not too far away go to

494
00:21:37,319 --> 00:21:41,439
Harford Connecticut go to ICP Long

495
00:21:39,159 --> 00:21:43,600
Island go to

496
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:46,919
Philadelphia and it's

497
00:21:43,599 --> 00:21:49,240
15% we get quite a bit Improvement on

498
00:21:46,919 --> 00:21:53,200
the white environment if we go away from

499
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:53,200
itha which is probably not a

500
00:21:54,759 --> 00:21:59,919
surprise um production in a greenhouse

501
00:21:57,359 --> 00:22:02,439
can be lowered by adding C

502
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:03,840
2 one of the outputs of the ca program

503
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:06,320
has been a couple of algorithms for

504
00:22:03,839 --> 00:22:08,918
controlling light One controls the light

505
00:22:06,319 --> 00:22:11,439
to a daily integral consistently the

506
00:22:08,919 --> 00:22:15,038
other one is to control the light and

507
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:16,600
CO2 and what the CO2 does it makes the

508
00:22:15,038 --> 00:22:18,158
natural light more efficient so you need

509
00:22:16,599 --> 00:22:20,319
less supplemental light and then it

510
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:23,480
makes the supplemental light more

511
00:22:20,319 --> 00:22:24,918
efficient and the simulations showed 49%

512
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:26,720
savings on

513
00:22:24,919 --> 00:22:29,240
electricity now for that was a

514
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:32,519
simulation computer simulation obviously

515
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:34,720
true it was my

516
00:22:32,519 --> 00:22:37,759
program but we set up an experiment and

517
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:40,919
Tim shelford ran data in the post green

518
00:22:37,759 --> 00:22:44,278
houses excuse me green green

519
00:22:40,919 --> 00:22:46,880
houses I will never learn

520
00:22:44,278 --> 00:22:48,599
that and pretty much agreed with this

521
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:50,480
now that that Greenhouse is much darker

522
00:22:48,599 --> 00:22:52,678
than the 70% transmissive Greenhouse so

523
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:56,159
the numbers aren't quite the same but

524
00:22:52,679 --> 00:22:58,000
the conclusion was was right that we can

525
00:22:56,159 --> 00:23:00,440
reduce the yearly lighting by about a

526
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,440
half

527
00:23:00,599 --> 00:23:04,599
but you cannot do that in a closed

528
00:23:02,359 --> 00:23:06,639
system because you add CO2 you're not

529
00:23:04,599 --> 00:23:09,079
reducing the amount of you're not making

530
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:11,799
outside light more efficient you're

531
00:23:09,079 --> 00:23:15,319
relying entirely on the supplemental

532
00:23:11,798 --> 00:23:18,839
light and yes it saves and it saves

533
00:23:15,319 --> 00:23:21,079
maybe 30% at best so there is a savings

534
00:23:18,839 --> 00:23:23,319
there but not quite the same as a

535
00:23:21,079 --> 00:23:24,960
greenhouse no matter where it's located

536
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:26,558
course plant Factory doesn't matter

537
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:30,000
where it's

538
00:23:26,558 --> 00:23:34,038
located um now these bring the salad

539
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:35,880
crop carbon Footprints very close to

540
00:23:34,038 --> 00:23:36,640
what is imposed by importing the crop

541
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:39,440
from

542
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:41,120
California so the greenhouse can be also

543
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:43,400
very efficient so we can get back to

544
00:23:41,119 --> 00:23:45,879
that but since we talked about carbon

545
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:47,840
footprint ask what is the carbon

546
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:50,039
footprint associated with creating

547
00:23:47,839 --> 00:23:51,798
supplemental light to grow a food crop

548
00:23:50,038 --> 00:23:54,158
100% supplemental light what is the

549
00:23:51,798 --> 00:23:56,119
carbon

550
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:59,080
footprint and I'll measure the carbon

551
00:23:56,119 --> 00:24:01,319
footprint to express it in the mass or

552
00:23:59,079 --> 00:24:04,639
volume of CO2 that's given off and I'm

553
00:24:01,319 --> 00:24:06,918
not talking about CO2 in the

554
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:10,000
greenhouse if you're running a lot of

555
00:24:06,919 --> 00:24:12,320
lights in a greenhouse where's the CO2

556
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,319
coming

557
00:24:12,359 --> 00:24:17,079
from you go down to the power plant

558
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:19,558
they're generating the electricity and

559
00:24:17,079 --> 00:24:22,678
they are emitting the

560
00:24:19,558 --> 00:24:26,480
CO2 it's a generally overlooked

561
00:24:22,679 --> 00:24:29,000
point now this is data for power plant

562
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:32,679
production the United States looking at

563
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:34,880
grams of CO2 per kilowatt hour for coal

564
00:24:32,679 --> 00:24:37,759
for gas for the others which of course

565
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:40,840
don't burn anything and if you take

566
00:24:37,759 --> 00:24:43,480
these numbers which are still valid I

567
00:24:40,839 --> 00:24:45,839
just looked at the site January and the

568
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:49,839
numbers are still

569
00:24:45,839 --> 00:24:51,398
valid and then the

570
00:24:49,839 --> 00:24:55,678
mean

571
00:24:51,398 --> 00:24:57,479
um use of these fuel forms 32% of our

572
00:24:55,679 --> 00:25:01,200
electricity over the country comes from

573
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:03,679
coal 2% from natural gas the rest from

574
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:04,798
these other forms put them all together

575
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:08,798
in

576
00:25:04,798 --> 00:25:12,679
average and you get with four 460 gr per

577
00:25:08,798 --> 00:25:15,278
kilowatt hour or 046 gram or roughly a

578
00:25:12,679 --> 00:25:17,360
pound of CO2 per kilowatt hour every

579
00:25:15,278 --> 00:25:19,759
kilowatt hour you burn puts a pound of

580
00:25:17,359 --> 00:25:22,519
CO2 into the

581
00:25:19,759 --> 00:25:26,278
atmosphere run a 100 watt lamp for 10

582
00:25:22,519 --> 00:25:26,278
hours you put a pound of CO2 in the

583
00:25:26,519 --> 00:25:30,639
atmosphere so what does it mean in

584
00:25:28,359 --> 00:25:33,439
practical

585
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:35,720
sense another one of these graphs

586
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:37,558
again charts but we're going to take

587
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:40,000
let's say the Daily Light integral 17

588
00:25:37,558 --> 00:25:41,240
everything is the numbers change a bit

589
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:44,159
depending on the Daily Light integral

590
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:46,200
that you impose 6205 moles per square

591
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:49,600
meter per day productivity 760 per

592
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:53,278
square meter per year head weight 5

593
00:25:49,599 --> 00:25:56,798
ounces 5 to 6 ounces 150 160 gram

594
00:25:53,278 --> 00:26:01,679
efficacy of three again we have three

595
00:25:56,798 --> 00:26:04,759
moles going into 6205 5 IS 268 Kow hours

596
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:08,919
to grow 118

597
00:26:04,759 --> 00:26:11,158
kg 175 kilow hours per kilogram divide

598
00:26:08,919 --> 00:26:16,960
118 into

599
00:26:11,159 --> 00:26:19,240
2068 at47 kilg per kilog wat hour 8 kilg

600
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:21,480
of CO2 per kilogram of lettuce or 8

601
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:23,558
pounds of CO2 per pound of

602
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:27,159
lettuce

603
00:26:23,558 --> 00:26:30,038
okay quite a lotr now how put some

604
00:26:27,159 --> 00:26:34,278
physical meaning into this

605
00:26:30,038 --> 00:26:36,079
one way I looked at

606
00:26:34,278 --> 00:26:39,880
data and

607
00:26:36,079 --> 00:26:43,879
it's as of January 2014 the average par

608
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:46,360
passenger car in the US emits 5100 kg of

609
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:48,440
CO2 per

610
00:26:46,359 --> 00:26:52,398
year and we

611
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:54,919
have 8 pounds a kilogram 8 kilograms of

612
00:26:52,398 --> 00:26:58,359
CO2 per kilogram of

613
00:26:54,919 --> 00:27:01,720
lettuce so 5100 kg from one car is

614
00:26:58,359 --> 00:27:04,879
equivalent to CO2 emitted to grow 5100 /

615
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:08,679
8 636 kg of

616
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:12,880
lettuce has 4,000 heads of

617
00:27:08,679 --> 00:27:15,399
lettuce okay just over 3 days production

618
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:20,320
from The Challenge Greenhouse give you

619
00:27:15,398 --> 00:27:20,319
the same CO2 as driving a car for a

620
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:23,720
year okay when you will go back to the

621
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:26,640
power

622
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:28,558
plant again not counting the extra

623
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:30,080
energy for refrigeration air

624
00:27:28,558 --> 00:27:32,440
conditioning cooling all of those things

625
00:27:30,079 --> 00:27:35,678
in a plant

626
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:37,759
Factory another

627
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:40,720
comparison now we've seen up down to

628
00:27:37,759 --> 00:27:42,440
this point 8 8 pounds of CO2 per kilo

629
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:46,200
per pound of lettuce or

630
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:48,120
kilograms 8 pounds of CO2 per pound

631
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:53,399
three heads of lettuce per

632
00:27:48,119 --> 00:27:56,599
pound 26 2.67 pounds of CO2 per head of

633
00:27:53,398 --> 00:27:58,839
lettuce density of CO2 is .124 pounds

634
00:27:56,599 --> 00:28:01,519
per cubic foot

635
00:27:58,839 --> 00:28:03,879
21.6 cubic feet of CO2 per head of

636
00:28:01,519 --> 00:28:07,120
lettuce what does that

637
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:11,679
mean that's about you know this

638
00:28:07,119 --> 00:28:16,199
big 7.48 gallons per cubic

639
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:16,200
foot multiply 7.48

640
00:28:16,359 --> 00:28:22,839
21.6 every head of lettuce that's grown

641
00:28:19,038 --> 00:28:26,158
100% light creates CO2 at the power

642
00:28:22,839 --> 00:28:28,158
plant equivalent to 355 gallon

643
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:30,679
drums and I think we can all kind of

644
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:33,519
visualize a 55g drum three of them get

645
00:28:30,679 --> 00:28:38,080
filled to grow one head of

646
00:28:33,519 --> 00:28:38,079
lettuce in a totally enclosed

647
00:28:39,359 --> 00:28:42,359
system

648
00:28:44,079 --> 00:28:49,240
okay do it in a greenhouse I think a

649
00:28:46,278 --> 00:28:52,159
greenhouse 30% from the Sun from from

650
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:54,679
the white 70% from the sun it's down to

651
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:59,919
2.42 kg compared to

652
00:28:54,679 --> 00:29:01,480
8.05 it's better it's not great

653
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:04,200
we've seen this all supplemental light

654
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:04,200
is 8:1

655
00:29:04,839 --> 00:29:10,599
ratio 2.4 PBS in a greenhouse not

656
00:29:08,679 --> 00:29:12,440
wonderful but three three and a third

657
00:29:10,599 --> 00:29:15,398
times more CO2 from the greenhous from

658
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:16,798
the plant Factory than from a greenhouse

659
00:29:15,398 --> 00:29:19,518
and then comes the question is this

660
00:29:16,798 --> 00:29:22,558
sustainable agriculture it's is sold as

661
00:29:19,519 --> 00:29:26,759
as a sustainable agriculture

662
00:29:22,558 --> 00:29:31,240
process you decide if it is 55 gallon 3

663
00:29:26,759 --> 00:29:31,240
55 gallon drums for one had a lettuce

664
00:29:31,359 --> 00:29:35,278
sustainable and it disregards the

665
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:37,919
additional carbon

666
00:29:35,278 --> 00:29:40,480
footprint well I work with Norm Scott

667
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:42,559
and Norm Scott some of you may know Norm

668
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:44,720
he's a great Enthusiast

669
00:29:42,558 --> 00:29:46,759
about self-contained cities

670
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:47,960
self-supporting cities and he looked at

671
00:29:46,759 --> 00:29:49,679
the number for lettuce and he said well

672
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:50,840
that's lettuce what about tomatoes that

673
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:54,200
might be

674
00:29:50,839 --> 00:29:56,240
different okay so I went to lettuce to

675
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:59,558
from lettuce to Tomato did the same

676
00:29:56,240 --> 00:30:04,640
calculations and whereas lettuce had 8

677
00:29:59,558 --> 00:30:07,079
to1 ratio Tomatoes had 18 to1

678
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:10,480
ratio it's much

679
00:30:07,079 --> 00:30:12,759
worse why well you st to think about

680
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:15,240
tomatoes what they have stems and leaves

681
00:30:12,759 --> 00:30:16,919
and things that you don't eat they have

682
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:21,120
to be

683
00:30:16,919 --> 00:30:21,120
grown so

684
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:26,798
um yeah stems and leaves and all um

685
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:28,919
tomato production cannot be stacked as

686
00:30:26,798 --> 00:30:30,240
another consideration so the building

687
00:30:28,919 --> 00:30:32,480
has to be a lot taller you need a lot

688
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:34,200
more

689
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:36,839
volume

690
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:39,840
um well and tomatoes have a higher dry

691
00:30:36,839 --> 00:30:41,480
Mass content so that they uh you're

692
00:30:39,839 --> 00:30:44,000
putting more light into a single tomato

693
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:44,000
into a single

694
00:30:44,558 --> 00:30:50,879
pound I worry about this this the in

695
00:30:49,079 --> 00:30:53,879
initiation of this was related to the

696
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:56,480
use the concept of food

697
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:59,440
miles and how does this compare to

698
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:02,519
transported lettuce

699
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:04,720
there is a website a report David dilers

700
00:31:02,519 --> 00:31:07,839
spent many hours working on an energy

701
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:10,159
study for nerta looking at the energy

702
00:31:07,839 --> 00:31:11,558
cost of importing versus locally grown

703
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:14,159
four six different

704
00:31:11,558 --> 00:31:16,599
crops some Greenhouse some

705
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:17,679
outdoors the report is on the website if

706
00:31:16,599 --> 00:31:21,278
anybody

707
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:24,919
wants if if you want if you want this

708
00:31:21,278 --> 00:31:26,519
send me an email and I will we'll uh

709
00:31:24,919 --> 00:31:29,880
send you the actual

710
00:31:26,519 --> 00:31:34,278
URL send me email which reminds

711
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:38,159
me my initials are LDA right L stands

712
00:31:34,278 --> 00:31:38,159
for Lou and d stands for Devil's

713
00:31:38,319 --> 00:31:44,839
Advocate okay so

714
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:48,960
that's David's data All Imports to New

715
00:31:44,839 --> 00:31:51,959
York this is transported in various ways

716
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:54,360
7 kg of CO2 per kilogram of

717
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:56,120
lettuce from truck exhaust from very

718
00:31:54,359 --> 00:31:58,359
other other various other sources of

719
00:31:56,119 --> 00:32:00,278
Transport the average food miles for a

720
00:31:58,359 --> 00:32:02,558
lettuce to New York is 2963 and that's

721
00:32:00,278 --> 00:32:06,440
where people really worry and they

722
00:32:02,558 --> 00:32:09,519
should plant Factory 8.05 compared to7

723
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:10,679
for lighting only transport is for

724
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:13,759
everything this

725
00:32:10,679 --> 00:32:16,080
is eight for lighting plant Factory

726
00:32:13,759 --> 00:32:20,158
adding CO2 saving a third

727
00:32:16,079 --> 00:32:22,599
5.6 CA antha using Lassie as our acronym

728
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:24,278
for our light control algorithm and

729
00:32:22,599 --> 00:32:28,918
program

730
00:32:24,278 --> 00:32:34,278
2.42 CN Long Island with control 1.21

731
00:32:28,919 --> 00:32:36,960
CA in itha with CO2 control 1.23 CA on

732
00:32:34,278 --> 00:32:40,638
Long Island with CO2 control.

733
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:43,519
62 using this L step by step by step

734
00:32:40,638 --> 00:32:47,558
change in production we can get the CO2

735
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:51,440
providing to be the same as the CO2 for

736
00:32:47,558 --> 00:32:53,720
imports not a lot lower but at least the

737
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:57,600
same and there will be certain benefits

738
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:57,600
of course for local production

739
00:32:58,359 --> 00:33:03,558
so is there a solution to the light

740
00:33:01,119 --> 00:33:07,359
problem I'm going to run

741
00:33:03,558 --> 00:33:07,359
over not run over

742
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:11,759
but okay people have talked about

743
00:33:10,398 --> 00:33:14,479
different ways

744
00:33:11,759 --> 00:33:16,679
of improving the light LEDs

745
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:18,599
concentrating or whatever can this work

746
00:33:16,679 --> 00:33:21,759
is this sustainable and the important

747
00:33:18,599 --> 00:33:24,879
question do we violate laws of

748
00:33:21,759 --> 00:33:28,798
physics prefer not to actually I've made

749
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:28,799
a career out of trying to

750
00:33:29,119 --> 00:33:31,638
let's look electrically generated light

751
00:33:30,759 --> 00:33:34,038
in

752
00:33:31,638 --> 00:33:36,879
general now before anybody asks this one

753
00:33:34,038 --> 00:33:36,879
is on the final

754
00:33:37,638 --> 00:33:42,839
exam but just briefly what this says

755
00:33:41,038 --> 00:33:44,398
planks law we've heard about Plank's law

756
00:33:42,839 --> 00:33:46,359
the outcome of planks law is theoretical

757
00:33:44,398 --> 00:33:48,000
maximum efficiency which can be

758
00:33:46,359 --> 00:33:50,719
expressed instantaneously or integrated

759
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,880
don't worry about that we have things to

760
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:55,480
worry about with thermal losses

761
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:57,320
electrical losses Optical losses to go

762
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:58,558
from theoretical maximum efficiency to

763
00:33:57,319 --> 00:34:01,720
real world

764
00:33:58,558 --> 00:34:05,678
the result is a wall plug efficiency of

765
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:10,679
perhaps 20 or 25% the same as

766
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:13,159
HPS Philips provides data for their

767
00:34:10,679 --> 00:34:15,358
LEDs the efficiency goes over a range

768
00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:18,878
because it depends on which bin they

769
00:34:15,358 --> 00:34:19,838
take their LED out of because they they

770
00:34:18,878 --> 00:34:22,598
test them

771
00:34:19,838 --> 00:34:24,559
all and we end up with a real world

772
00:34:22,599 --> 00:34:28,000
efficacy near three I use three all the

773
00:34:24,559 --> 00:34:29,719
way along and if you want to not believe

774
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:32,159
it I can send you this slide and you can

775
00:34:29,719 --> 00:34:32,158
check my

776
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,960
numbers LED Technologies are improving

777
00:34:35,519 --> 00:34:38,320
and their costs are shrinking but don't

778
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:41,199
believe the

779
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:44,760
internet surprise

780
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:45,838
no I've seen ads for Led systems for

781
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:48,760
plant

782
00:34:45,838 --> 00:34:51,440
lighting that suggest a degree of

783
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:53,200
efficiency somewhere in the range of 150

784
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:55,000
to

785
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:58,279
175%

786
00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:02,000
truly six times as good as an

787
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:04,440
HPS six times as efficient as an

788
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:08,159
HPS those are the

789
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:10,720
claims watch more not justified by

790
00:35:08,159 --> 00:35:14,039
data usually the comparisons are against

791
00:35:10,719 --> 00:35:15,439
H against fluorescent or incandescent to

792
00:35:14,039 --> 00:35:16,639
make themselves look good depends

793
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:18,480
whether you're buying or selling and

794
00:35:16,639 --> 00:35:21,319
they're

795
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:23,599
selling um and hid luminar and T5

796
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:26,680
fluoresence are also much more efficient

797
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:28,960
than incandescent and efficiency is very

798
00:35:26,679 --> 00:35:30,279
similar to LEDs so we can't do a whole

799
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,838
lot to make the lighting more efficient

800
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:34,040
we can do a little bit and it will be

801
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:35,320
done but it's not going to be done is

802
00:35:34,039 --> 00:35:38,800
enormous

803
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:40,640
change what about vots always this is

804
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:41,560
the argument that always comes back too

805
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:43,039
yeah I know it takes a lot of

806
00:35:41,559 --> 00:35:46,159
electricity but I'm going to put up PV

807
00:35:43,039 --> 00:35:48,559
panels and do

808
00:35:46,159 --> 00:35:50,239
it let's look first at the greenhouse if

809
00:35:48,559 --> 00:35:52,599
we look at a greenhouse a modern

810
00:35:50,239 --> 00:35:55,039
Greenhouse 100 units of outside light

811
00:35:52,599 --> 00:35:57,838
70% transmissive we get 70 units of

812
00:35:55,039 --> 00:35:59,559
solar light through the greenhouse to

813
00:35:57,838 --> 00:36:04,000
the plant canopy so it's effectively a

814
00:35:59,559 --> 00:36:04,000
70% efficient transmitter of outdoor

815
00:36:04,199 --> 00:36:09,318
light looking at a PV system now we

816
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:11,679
generate electricity from the photo

817
00:36:09,318 --> 00:36:13,639
photovoltaic panels bring it into the

818
00:36:11,679 --> 00:36:16,159
greenhouse run lights that's what I mean

819
00:36:13,639 --> 00:36:18,639
by generating

820
00:36:16,159 --> 00:36:20,159
electricity panels are typically 15 to

821
00:36:18,639 --> 00:36:22,838
18%

822
00:36:20,159 --> 00:36:25,879
efficient by

823
00:36:22,838 --> 00:36:27,239
themselves there are 11 D rating factors

824
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:30,559
that are always applied when you put a

825
00:36:27,239 --> 00:36:32,239
panel into a system you lose something

826
00:36:30,559 --> 00:36:35,759
in fact you lose

827
00:36:32,239 --> 00:36:38,598
28% standard default

828
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:40,640
numbers availability in need may be

829
00:36:38,599 --> 00:36:42,318
asynchronous you know the bright sunny

830
00:36:40,639 --> 00:36:45,639
day when you can generate electricity

831
00:36:42,318 --> 00:36:45,639
you don't need it in the

832
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:50,880
greenhouse um cloudiness Is frequent

833
00:36:49,199 --> 00:36:54,000
diffuse diffuse solar is weaker but it

834
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:54,000
can be used but it is

835
00:36:55,599 --> 00:36:59,760
weaker jumping through this we don't

836
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:02,599
worry about the steps anymore but

837
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:06,000
looking at using the panel at 18%

838
00:37:02,599 --> 00:37:08,318
efficiency apply the standard 28% loss

839
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:10,760
if they get 223 kilow hours per square

840
00:37:08,318 --> 00:37:12,239
meter per year predicted and I've

841
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:13,760
compared that to real data and it's it's

842
00:37:12,239 --> 00:37:16,799
a pretty good

843
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:19,920
number efficiency of three efficacy of

844
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:23,480
three panels provide 669 moles per

845
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:25,000
square meter we need 6205 for the 17

846
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:26,519
moles per square meter per day Daily

847
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:30,159
Light

848
00:37:26,519 --> 00:37:34,480
integral so it's that 669 divided by

849
00:37:30,159 --> 00:37:38,078
62.5 10.8% of the need for one square

850
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:41,159
meter invert that we're providing 10% of

851
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:44,000
the need we're going to need much more

852
00:37:41,159 --> 00:37:46,598
area in this case 99.3 times as much

853
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:50,559
this lighted area one acre of greenhouse

854
00:37:46,599 --> 00:37:53,440
lighted 9.3 Acres of

855
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:58,920
panels no way does that

856
00:37:53,440 --> 00:38:01,280
work not in this world not in my world

857
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:03,240
any times the growing area asynchronous

858
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:06,400
problem

859
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:08,159
um by asynchronous of course you produce

860
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:09,480
electricity when there's sunshine you

861
00:38:08,159 --> 00:38:13,118
don't need it in the greenhouse or in

862
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:14,679
the whatever may not need it send it

863
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:16,480
back to the power company say I use the

864
00:38:14,679 --> 00:38:18,679
grid as storage don't forget if you send

865
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:20,719
things back to the power company you

866
00:38:18,679 --> 00:38:22,679
don't get the full price you get only

867
00:38:20,719 --> 00:38:24,879
what they would have paid to replace

868
00:38:22,679 --> 00:38:24,879
that

869
00:38:25,719 --> 00:38:30,159
energy another small new Nuance that I

870
00:38:28,159 --> 00:38:32,480
think is important about this using

871
00:38:30,159 --> 00:38:34,759
renewable energies to do things that are

872
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:36,960
foolish is that you are depriving

873
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:39,119
someone else of the access to that

874
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:41,358
renewable

875
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:44,280
energy because that someone else does

876
00:38:41,358 --> 00:38:46,480
not have another source I would have a

877
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:48,440
source I could go to a

878
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:51,119
greenhouse instead I have a plant

879
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:52,679
Factory and I'm wasting the energy

880
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:54,880
taking it away from someone else who

881
00:38:52,679 --> 00:38:59,440
could use

882
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:59,440
it I don't understand that point

883
00:38:59,719 --> 00:39:05,679
okay we have fot

884
00:39:02,679 --> 00:39:09,039
panels and I have a choice between a

885
00:39:05,679 --> 00:39:10,279
greenhouse or a plant Factory and I say

886
00:39:09,039 --> 00:39:11,880
I'm going to take a plant Factory and

887
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:16,400
I'm going to use the renewable

888
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:19,838
energy you still have to use your grid

889
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:22,160
energy if I were to take the greenhouse

890
00:39:19,838 --> 00:39:24,318
instead we now have renewable energy

891
00:39:22,159 --> 00:39:27,639
that's not being wasted in my plant

892
00:39:24,318 --> 00:39:29,440
Factory it's now available to you I see

893
00:39:27,639 --> 00:39:31,838
okay so you're taking it away or I'm

894
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:34,559
taking it away from you the overall

895
00:39:31,838 --> 00:39:34,559
system is not

896
00:39:35,838 --> 00:39:40,838
improved

897
00:39:38,159 --> 00:39:43,239
okay flat mirrors people say we're going

898
00:39:40,838 --> 00:39:43,239
to do

899
00:39:43,358 --> 00:39:47,440
mirrors it's an obvious thing it's

900
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:49,160
violate through all physics no we can't

901
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:52,000
direct things with flat mirrors if we

902
00:39:49,159 --> 00:39:53,799
diffuse radiation is diffusely reflected

903
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:56,838
you can't direct it into the plant

904
00:39:53,800 --> 00:40:00,200
Factory using flat mirrors well we won't

905
00:39:56,838 --> 00:40:03,199
use flat mirror we'll use concentrating

906
00:40:00,199 --> 00:40:07,039
mirrors this Bomier says

907
00:40:03,199 --> 00:40:09,399
this two two kinds of

908
00:40:07,039 --> 00:40:11,639
whoops two kinds of

909
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:14,280
of concentrating

910
00:40:11,639 --> 00:40:16,559
mirrors parabolic shape for a

911
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:21,400
reflector reflects the incoming light to

912
00:40:16,559 --> 00:40:22,759
a line if it's a 2d Parabola to a focal

913
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:25,760
point in a pipe where it carries the

914
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:27,119
heat away or to a surface at the bottom

915
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,920
where it absorbs the Heat and carries it

916
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:28,920
away

917
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:31,318
one way or

918
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:33,240
another the light is reflected down and

919
00:40:31,318 --> 00:40:34,559
collected into a small area inside of

920
00:40:33,239 --> 00:40:37,039
the

921
00:40:34,559 --> 00:40:39,960
reflector it does not get shown back

922
00:40:37,039 --> 00:40:42,519
over to someplace

923
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:44,159
else you don't bounce it over somewhere

924
00:40:42,519 --> 00:40:46,480
else and and

925
00:40:44,159 --> 00:40:47,920
concentrate we concentrate into a small

926
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:52,440
area and what are we going to do with

927
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:55,599
all this heat in the middle of the

928
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:59,240
collector but you can of course Focus if

929
00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:59,240
you want to build this

930
00:40:59,318 --> 00:41:03,119
this this is a Power Tower happens to be

931
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:06,358
in Spain there are some in the United

932
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:09,800
States each of these is a little flat

933
00:41:06,358 --> 00:41:11,559
plate collect reflector they are

934
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:15,680
controlled by a computer to reflect the

935
00:41:11,559 --> 00:41:17,679
sunlight into a tower where it collect

936
00:41:15,679 --> 00:41:20,799
the heat generate electricity do that

937
00:41:17,679 --> 00:41:22,480
sort of thing this won't be parts of

938
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:24,880
green

939
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:28,599
houses another issue solar angles in the

940
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:30,200
summer are very different from winter

941
00:41:28,599 --> 00:41:33,838
so many of these you put the flat side

942
00:41:30,199 --> 00:41:37,199
of the greenhouse this Tower facing

943
00:41:33,838 --> 00:41:39,480
south and then think about what

944
00:41:37,199 --> 00:41:41,639
happens if I was pretend I'm facing

945
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:44,920
south I'm not but pretend I

946
00:41:41,639 --> 00:41:48,879
am in the winter time the sun rises over

947
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:52,800
here goes up and down that's fine it's

948
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:52,800
coming into the South

949
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:58,880
glazings fall and spring it's coming

950
00:41:55,760 --> 00:42:01,280
over here going overhead like that

951
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:03,200
doesn't shine on the front so we don't

952
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:06,200
have access to the light in the

953
00:42:03,199 --> 00:42:09,679
summertime sun rises in the

954
00:42:06,199 --> 00:42:12,759
Northeast comes up high and goes

955
00:42:09,679 --> 00:42:14,799
up back to the Northwest doesn't shine

956
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:18,640
into the building very much at all using

957
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:22,599
solar light into a tall building like

958
00:42:18,639 --> 00:42:24,759
this the sun just you can't move the

959
00:42:22,599 --> 00:42:29,119
sun now perhaps you could put this

960
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:29,119
building onto a rotating platform

961
00:42:31,358 --> 00:42:37,000
but there is this

962
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:39,760
problem the reflectivity of surfaces

963
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:42,280
once you get past about 55° the

964
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:45,119
reflectivity begins to go

965
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:46,880
up okay so if that sun is the middle of

966
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:49,318
the day in the summertime 76 degrees

967
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:52,119
above the Horizon in itha in solar noon

968
00:42:49,318 --> 00:42:53,239
on the first day of summer that angle is

969
00:42:52,119 --> 00:42:55,838
much more than

970
00:42:53,239 --> 00:42:59,000
56° it's going to be bounced down to the

971
00:42:55,838 --> 00:43:01,719
ground most of

972
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:04,199
it we look at the angle of incidence

973
00:43:01,719 --> 00:43:07,598
itself look at the

974
00:43:04,199 --> 00:43:10,960
angle that the Sun comes in to a south

975
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:11,838
facing surface 21st of March south

976
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:16,240
facing

977
00:43:11,838 --> 00:43:20,558
surface only a few days will it be less

978
00:43:16,239 --> 00:43:23,239
than 55 a few I mean a few um times and

979
00:43:20,559 --> 00:43:26,079
latitudes this is 21st of

980
00:43:23,239 --> 00:43:28,799
March April we're down to the point

981
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:30,960
where almost almost no time during the

982
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:34,440
year because you have sun coming into

983
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:36,639
that south facing surface

984
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:40,838
effectively May

985
00:43:36,639 --> 00:43:44,239
none June none which means July August

986
00:43:40,838 --> 00:43:46,318
September none you know it's the same

987
00:43:44,239 --> 00:43:48,078
symmetric so we have this problem of

988
00:43:46,318 --> 00:43:50,079
reflectivity and the solar angles

989
00:43:48,079 --> 00:43:53,839
shining into a greenhouse if the

990
00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:57,960
greenhouse is a vertical Farm skyscraper

991
00:43:53,838 --> 00:43:59,799
Farm a slightly more positive note

992
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:03,159
there are

993
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:05,559
some there's the concept of per Urban

994
00:44:03,159 --> 00:44:09,118
Agriculture and if you think

995
00:44:05,559 --> 00:44:12,839
back you know go back few thousand

996
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:15,119
years not even I do that back a few

997
00:44:12,838 --> 00:44:18,119
thousand years there were Villages

998
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:20,318
surrounded by Farms who fed the fed the

999
00:44:18,119 --> 00:44:21,358
village they weren't imported long ways

1000
00:44:20,318 --> 00:44:23,079
but they weren't in the middle of the

1001
00:44:21,358 --> 00:44:26,039
village either they were

1002
00:44:23,079 --> 00:44:28,119
surrounding that one concept that might

1003
00:44:26,039 --> 00:44:30,318
apply into this question of getting

1004
00:44:28,119 --> 00:44:32,519
local food production a number of

1005
00:44:30,318 --> 00:44:35,039
advantages the Perry urban area is the

1006
00:44:32,519 --> 00:44:37,079
between the city and the surrounding

1007
00:44:35,039 --> 00:44:39,558
Countryside but you have

1008
00:44:37,079 --> 00:44:42,318
advantages less expensive land lower

1009
00:44:39,559 --> 00:44:44,599
construction costs growing Building

1010
00:44:42,318 --> 00:44:47,679
green houses instead of

1011
00:44:44,599 --> 00:44:49,599
skyscrapers the big difference there

1012
00:44:47,679 --> 00:44:51,838
access to the INF infrastructure this is

1013
00:44:49,599 --> 00:44:53,400
important we want to have natural gas

1014
00:44:51,838 --> 00:44:55,679
probably you want to have perhaps

1015
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:58,119
three-phase power perhaps Municipal

1016
00:44:55,679 --> 00:45:00,919
Water you have Services there and you

1017
00:44:58,119 --> 00:45:02,640
have highways put it on a big truck send

1018
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:05,800
it into the produce

1019
00:45:02,639 --> 00:45:07,118
market one shot transport rather than

1020
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:09,200
everybody coming in with their little

1021
00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:11,318
Panel trucks from all over the city to

1022
00:45:09,199 --> 00:45:13,639
your

1023
00:45:11,318 --> 00:45:14,759
Greenhouse located away from air

1024
00:45:13,639 --> 00:45:17,279
pollution

1025
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:19,559
plumes this is a hard point to

1026
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:22,800
sell that air pollution does affect

1027
00:45:19,559 --> 00:45:24,640
plant growth does affect

1028
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:25,960
considerably could give you several

1029
00:45:24,639 --> 00:45:29,318
papers that

1030
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:31,318
show City Air suppresses the growth of

1031
00:45:29,318 --> 00:45:35,440
lettuce by about

1032
00:45:31,318 --> 00:45:38,599
30% so it is an important

1033
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:41,519
factor scenarios where this might

1034
00:45:38,599 --> 00:45:44,838
work one that might be possible I've had

1035
00:45:41,519 --> 00:45:47,000
some contact with some Oman for instance

1036
00:45:44,838 --> 00:45:48,880
who look at this as a source of food

1037
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:51,159
because everything is being imported now

1038
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:54,119
but water is more valuable than

1039
00:45:51,159 --> 00:45:56,118
electricity to them if you have a system

1040
00:45:54,119 --> 00:45:58,440
like this with refrigeration the

1041
00:45:56,119 --> 00:46:00,640
refrigeration system system captures the

1042
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:02,119
condensate so you pull the evapo

1043
00:46:00,639 --> 00:46:05,639
transpiration back out of the water and

1044
00:46:02,119 --> 00:46:08,880
you save energy or save water excuse

1045
00:46:05,639 --> 00:46:13,679
me um if the world is entirely on

1046
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:13,680
renewable energy there's no carbon

1047
00:46:14,358 --> 00:46:19,039
footprint may not happen right away

1048
00:46:17,358 --> 00:46:22,078
solely on fishing energy no carbon

1049
00:46:19,039 --> 00:46:24,358
footprint solely on Fusion Energy no car

1050
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:26,640
footprint so are there possible

1051
00:46:24,358 --> 00:46:28,639
recapture benefits I don't think any of

1052
00:46:26,639 --> 00:46:30,759
these scenarios are very

1053
00:46:28,639 --> 00:46:34,400
likely you may think

1054
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:36,760
differently anybody got money put into

1055
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:39,280
Fusion

1056
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:40,800
no there may be small scale applications

1057
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:42,680
of course where total closure would work

1058
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:45,519
and that's different from talking about

1059
00:46:42,679 --> 00:46:47,639
Green Houses germination

1060
00:46:45,519 --> 00:46:50,318
Chambers perhaps part of a greenhouse

1061
00:46:47,639 --> 00:46:52,719
operation perhaps not tissue culture

1062
00:46:50,318 --> 00:46:54,079
rooms works that's been done for years

1063
00:46:52,719 --> 00:46:57,159
GMO research where you don't want

1064
00:46:54,079 --> 00:46:59,760
transfer of genetic information back and

1065
00:46:57,159 --> 00:47:03,598
forth across the structural wall

1066
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:06,200
Fairbanks Alaska good work south pole

1067
00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:08,640
research station they have one there

1068
00:47:06,199 --> 00:47:10,039
it's a good emotional Outlet sort of

1069
00:47:08,639 --> 00:47:13,598
place people go in and relax and it

1070
00:47:10,039 --> 00:47:15,800
feels like it's back home again for a

1071
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:18,200
while so I conclude is the Emperor

1072
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:21,079
wearing any new

1073
00:47:18,199 --> 00:47:22,159
clothes do numbers lie be happy to go

1074
00:47:21,079 --> 00:47:24,640
through the numbers that anybody who

1075
00:47:22,159 --> 00:47:26,480
wants to really double check can we

1076
00:47:24,639 --> 00:47:28,759
violate the laws of physics more than a

1077
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:31,119
little bit

1078
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:31,119
and you

1079
00:47:31,838 --> 00:47:37,719
decide so thank you is a few minutes for

1080
00:47:38,639 --> 00:47:44,159
questions this has been a production of

1081
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:47,160
Cornell University on the web at

1082
