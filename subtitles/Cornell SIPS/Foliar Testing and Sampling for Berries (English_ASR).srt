1
00:00:02,759 --> 00:00:10,879
Dr Marvin pritz uh who is with uh

2
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:14,798
Department of horiculture at Cornell and

3
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:17,278
um is our uh Berry expert here in uh New

4
00:00:14,798 --> 00:00:19,439
York State and uh this week he's going

5
00:00:17,278 --> 00:00:23,160
to talk about

6
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:25,759
um Fuller F year testing and visual

7
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:29,240
assessment of nutrients and established

8
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,240
Berry plantings

9
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:42,680
so you ready to go

10
00:00:37,558 --> 00:00:45,320
Marvin uh sure am okay okay I'm gonna

11
00:00:42,679 --> 00:00:48,799
wait till my uh clock here says 2

12
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:50,000
o'clock just get people oh is am I

13
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:53,679
running

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,679
early I think so okay all right it's all

15
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:56,679
right

16
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:11,159
okay well thanks everyone for joining us

17
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:13,478
uh today's topic is foler testing and

18
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:15,439
sampling and Berry crops it's going to

19
00:01:13,478 --> 00:01:18,400
be a little bit technical in places so

20
00:01:15,438 --> 00:01:22,478
feel free to use the box and and chat

21
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,478
box and submit your questions that

22
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:28,719
way so just to review the principles we

23
00:01:26,599 --> 00:01:31,078
have talked about up until this point we

24
00:01:28,719 --> 00:01:33,359
talked about soil test ing how that's

25
00:01:31,078 --> 00:01:36,798
most useful prior to planning where we

26
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:38,840
adjust our pH and adjust our nutrient

27
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:40,759
levels but now what we want to start

28
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:44,759
talking about is leaf analysis which is

29
00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:44,759
most appropriate once the planting is

30
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:50,159
established we like Leaf analysis better

31
00:01:48,438 --> 00:01:52,359
than soil analysis for established

32
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:54,719
plants because it actually determines

33
00:01:52,359 --> 00:01:56,039
what the plant itself is taken up and so

34
00:01:54,718 --> 00:01:58,839
it's a little bit more accurate

35
00:01:56,039 --> 00:02:00,519
assessment of nutrient status than

36
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:02,399
estimating availability

37
00:02:00,519 --> 00:02:04,438
from a chemical extractant so what the

38
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:07,560
chemical extractants do for the soil is

39
00:02:04,438 --> 00:02:09,199
they try to mimic what the root takes up

40
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:11,000
well if you have the actual plant taking

41
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:12,958
up the nutrient why not use the plant

42
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,719
instead of the extractant that's the

43
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:17,319
logic there and it's particularly

44
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:19,000
important in perennial crops where

45
00:02:17,318 --> 00:02:21,479
nutrients that are taken up one year can

46
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,479
be stored in reserve and used again in

47
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:24,878
subsequent years where a soil test

48
00:02:23,479 --> 00:02:26,840
doesn't really tell you what the plant's

49
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:29,959
going to do with the nutrient once it's

50
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:32,080
taken up so the Fuller testing is much

51
00:02:29,959 --> 00:02:34,959
much better for assessing nutrient

52
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:37,680
status in established perennial plant

53
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:39,959
and it's based on a simple principle and

54
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,760
that is look at what the nutrient levels

55
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:44,479
are in leaf tissue and compare it to a

56
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:46,439
standard it's no different than getting

57
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:48,439
your cholesterol tested at the doctor's

58
00:02:46,439 --> 00:02:50,039
office you know what sort of a normal

59
00:02:48,439 --> 00:02:52,000
range is and we can look and see if we

60
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:54,199
fall within that and then if we're too

61
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,439
high or too low we can do something

62
00:02:54,199 --> 00:02:56,439
about

63
00:02:56,639 --> 00:03:02,079
it and we have standard ranges for for

64
00:03:00,158 --> 00:03:05,280
strawberries for raspberries for

65
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:07,239
blueberries for all sorts of crops and

66
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:09,039
we'll look and see if our nutrient Falls

67
00:03:07,239 --> 00:03:11,319
within that range and that seems pretty

68
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:13,439
simple and straightforward we'll deal

69
00:03:11,318 --> 00:03:15,560
with these numbers in a lot more detail

70
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:19,680
in two weeks but just wanted to give you

71
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:23,400
a a sense that these standards do

72
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:26,480
exist the basis for the standards um are

73
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:28,438
the same from Lab to lab and so we don't

74
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:29,798
have this issue like we do with soils

75
00:03:28,438 --> 00:03:31,479
where it really depends on the

76
00:03:29,799 --> 00:03:33,519
extraction method as to what your

77
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:36,119
results are going to say and going to

78
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:40,120
tell you everybody pretty much use the

79
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:42,879
same type of analysis they use uh these

80
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:45,480
inductively coupled plasma spectrometers

81
00:03:42,878 --> 00:03:49,399
to look at the amount of nutrient that's

82
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:52,919
in a particular amount of tissue and the

83
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:54,438
way this works and the thing I think of

84
00:03:52,919 --> 00:03:56,399
most is when at least when I was a kid

85
00:03:54,438 --> 00:03:58,598
we had a fireplace and we had this

86
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,280
little bag of chemicals that had

87
00:03:58,598 --> 00:04:01,479
different um mineral

88
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:03,519
salts in there and we would throw it

89
00:04:01,479 --> 00:04:05,199
into the fire and a fire would glow

90
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:07,280
different colors it would be green and

91
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:09,318
red and orange and yellow depending on

92
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,039
what the nutrient was that we threw in

93
00:04:09,318 --> 00:04:15,000
there and it's the same principle with

94
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:16,719
these icps it takes a leaf it heats up

95
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,639
the material in that leaf to a really

96
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:22,320
hot temperature the minerals glow and

97
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:24,000
you can use that spectr photometer to

98
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:26,079
see how much of a glow you have in

99
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,040
certain color ranges and Spectra and

100
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:30,279
that tells you how much of that

101
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:31,960
particular element you have so it's

102
00:04:30,279 --> 00:04:35,719
pretty slick

103
00:04:31,959 --> 00:04:37,399
process it's the tissue ranges that we

104
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:39,080
have are derived from healthy plants

105
00:04:37,399 --> 00:04:41,279
they're usually not empirically derived

106
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:42,439
and what I mean by that is people don't

107
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:44,198
go out and do a lot of different

108
00:04:42,439 --> 00:04:46,399
experiments so they put different rates

109
00:04:44,199 --> 00:04:48,319
of say potassium and different rates of

110
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:49,959
calcium and different rates of magnesium

111
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:52,159
on the soil and look and see how the

112
00:04:49,959 --> 00:04:54,519
plants respond to that take tissue

113
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:57,280
samples along that range and then see

114
00:04:54,519 --> 00:04:59,918
what's optimal that's too much work and

115
00:04:57,279 --> 00:05:02,959
too much detail and too many interaction

116
00:04:59,918 --> 00:05:05,159
are possible so most of the time these

117
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:07,000
numbers come from plants that look

118
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:08,520
healthy they're growing healthy look

119
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,839
great they take a sample we see what

120
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:12,478
those values are and by doing that lots

121
00:05:10,839 --> 00:05:14,918
and lots and lots of times we can kind

122
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:17,478
of get a sense of what those ranges are

123
00:05:14,918 --> 00:05:19,839
for healthy growing

124
00:05:17,478 --> 00:05:21,639
plants and when we sample those leaves

125
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:24,879
we want to take them at a time when the

126
00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:29,680
leaf nutrient values are stable so when

127
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:30,719
are L nutrient values stable well um

128
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,400
we'll talk about that in a second

129
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:36,360
because that depends on some things but

130
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:38,719
in terms of measuring the values in the

131
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:41,080
leaves everything works well with this

132
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:43,440
ICP except for nitrogen and

133
00:05:41,079 --> 00:05:46,079
sulfur and those are the

134
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:47,478
exceptions um there's different methods

135
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:49,399
that exist to measure nitrogen and

136
00:05:47,478 --> 00:05:51,519
sulfur and leaves different ways of

137
00:05:49,399 --> 00:05:54,679
digesting the leaves to pull out the

138
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:56,839
nitrogen and sulfur and different tools

139
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:58,918
used to measure the amounts we can use

140
00:05:56,839 --> 00:06:01,959
colorometric spect Atomic methods we can

141
00:05:58,918 --> 00:06:03,799
use specific ion electrodes that we can

142
00:06:01,959 --> 00:06:06,318
stick it in the solution and measure how

143
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:08,960
much ammonium ion is there or we can do

144
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:13,280
some combustion and uh see what results

145
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:14,879
from that but um the values that you get

146
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:17,598
for these different methods are pretty

147
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:20,719
closely correlated so people don't worry

148
00:06:17,598 --> 00:06:21,879
too much about it sulfur in particular

149
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,319
uh even though there are differences

150
00:06:21,879 --> 00:06:25,719
with these methods uh it's rare that you

151
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:28,360
ever get a sulfur

152
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:31,479
deficiency um and so we don't worry

153
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:33,720
about that so much and nitrogen uh there

154
00:06:31,478 --> 00:06:36,360
it's pretty closely correlated to other

155
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:39,720
things the the nitrogen comes in two

156
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:42,680
different forms um it comes in this

157
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:44,960
ammonium form an organic form which is

158
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:48,598
biologically active and then it comes in

159
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:50,318
a nitrate form and the total of the

160
00:06:48,598 --> 00:06:52,240
nitrate in ammonium form gives you your

161
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:55,560
total amount of

162
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:57,840
nitrogen it's the nitrate form that's

163
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:59,759
not very active in the plant it's moved

164
00:06:57,839 --> 00:07:01,598
into the plant but it's not really

165
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:03,680
converted it has to be converted into

166
00:07:01,598 --> 00:07:05,279
products that are biologically active so

167
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:08,879
really when we measure nitrogen in a

168
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:10,519
leaf we really want to know how much nh4

169
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:13,360
plus is there that's the biologically

170
00:07:10,519 --> 00:07:14,279
active form but determining that is

171
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:18,120
pretty

172
00:07:14,279 --> 00:07:20,638
expensive and the nitrate concentration

173
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:24,360
in plants is generally pretty low it's

174
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:25,879
mostly just in the xylm vessels so often

175
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:28,038
times the cheapest way to do it is just

176
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:30,160
look at total nitrogen and assume that's

177
00:07:28,038 --> 00:07:32,360
really highly correlated are almost the

178
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:33,599
same as ammonium biologically active

179
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:35,319
nitrogen and that's what most Leaf

180
00:07:33,598 --> 00:07:37,000
analysis are based on so there's a

181
00:07:35,319 --> 00:07:38,960
little bit of error for nitrogen and the

182
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,360
same with suer but we don't worry about

183
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:41,359
it too

184
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:48,399
much so one of these Leaf values most

185
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:49,520
stable and when we we sample Lees well

186
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:51,598
we don't want to do it when the plants

187
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:53,318
are growing rapidly because the levels

188
00:07:51,598 --> 00:07:55,800
are fluctuating all over the place and

189
00:07:53,319 --> 00:07:58,120
nutrients are moving around to Growing

190
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:59,520
points and things just aren't stable

191
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:01,759
when plants are growing rapidly and

192
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:03,359
similarly when they're fruiting the

193
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:05,560
values are jumping all over the place

194
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:07,199
because you got a lot of export of

195
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:09,639
things like potassium from leaves to

196
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:11,800
fruit and fruit expansion and so things

197
00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:14,158
are fluctuating all over the place so we

198
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:16,560
need to find times when there's not a

199
00:08:14,158 --> 00:08:18,319
lot of rapid growth and there's not a

200
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:21,439
lot of fruit

201
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:24,759
expansion so for strawberries the best

202
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:26,560
time seems to be after harvest sort of

203
00:08:24,759 --> 00:08:29,759
that renovation time when the new leaves

204
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:31,879
start to grow out of the plant after

205
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:33,639
renovation you got a lot of rapid growth

206
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:36,158
in strawberry in the spring then of

207
00:08:33,639 --> 00:08:38,799
course they fruit right away and so none

208
00:08:36,158 --> 00:08:41,319
of those times in made in June and July

209
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:43,278
are really very good but August early

210
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:45,760
August is usually a good time Late July

211
00:08:43,278 --> 00:08:47,639
when those new leaves emerge that gives

212
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:48,799
us a good indication of the nutrient

213
00:08:47,639 --> 00:08:51,080
status of the

214
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:53,679
plant raspberries whether it's summer

215
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:56,000
bearing or fall bearing raspberries that

216
00:08:53,679 --> 00:08:58,439
August time slot seems to be the best

217
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,000
again most rapid growth happens in the

218
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:02,680
spring for both summer and fall Fring

219
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,839
raspberries the summer bearing

220
00:09:02,679 --> 00:09:06,559
raspberries are pretty much done the

221
00:09:04,839 --> 00:09:08,959
fall bearing raspberries haven't started

222
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:11,518
yet so if we sample leaves from the

223
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:14,078
primocanes not the floranes the

224
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:16,480
primocanes in early August it's a good

225
00:09:14,078 --> 00:09:17,599
time to sample because body is stable

226
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:20,000
the same way with

227
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:22,000
blueberries fruits already expanded we

228
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,278
might still have fruit in the plant but

229
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,278
we don't have a lot of expansion of the

230
00:09:24,278 --> 00:09:28,559
fruit at that time and most of the

231
00:09:26,278 --> 00:09:30,439
growth is stopped at that time so August

232
00:09:28,559 --> 00:09:32,119
is a good time to sample for those too

233
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:34,640
and we select the most recently mature

234
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:36,519
leaves if we select older leaves those

235
00:09:34,639 --> 00:09:38,838
were growing during a time of rapid

236
00:09:36,519 --> 00:09:41,000
growth or fruit expansion so the values

237
00:09:38,839 --> 00:09:43,200
there might not be representative but

238
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,200
the recently matured leaves at those

239
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:48,920
times are the

240
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:51,120
best we collect about 30 to 50 leaflets

241
00:09:48,919 --> 00:09:53,240
without the pedales because the pedales

242
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:56,000
sort of dilute what's in the leaves we

243
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:58,039
just want the lamin of the leaf randomly

244
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,360
sample the area that you're going to be

245
00:09:58,039 --> 00:10:03,120
interested in you you can either do it

246
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:04,560
as a diagnostic uh basis where I'm going

247
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:07,959
to just sample from plants that look

248
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:09,199
sick to see what's wrong or routine is

249
00:10:07,958 --> 00:10:11,078
just I want to see what the health of

250
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:13,680
this planet is so you just randomly go

251
00:10:11,078 --> 00:10:16,278
through the area and pick 50 leaflets

252
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:18,519
again the young leaves exposed to Sun

253
00:10:16,278 --> 00:10:20,639
and when you get those leaves uh it's

254
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:23,639
best to wash them off in distilled water

255
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:25,319
to get rid of the Dust U soil that might

256
00:10:23,639 --> 00:10:28,958
have splashed in the leaf or fungicide

257
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:32,079
residue because a lot of fungicides have

258
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:34,518
um elements in it metal elements in them

259
00:10:32,078 --> 00:10:36,399
so we going to wash those off and they

260
00:10:34,519 --> 00:10:37,720
can just go into a paper bag and dry for

261
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:40,879
a couple of days and then they can be

262
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:43,079
sent to a lab uh some people send us

263
00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:45,600
samples that they try to preserve them

264
00:10:43,078 --> 00:10:48,278
green and uh you know almost put them in

265
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,959
a press and press them down and all and

266
00:10:48,278 --> 00:10:51,278
send them with some moisture in a

267
00:10:49,958 --> 00:10:52,919
plastic bag we don't need that we're

268
00:10:51,278 --> 00:10:54,639
going to dry them as soon as we get them

269
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:56,599
so you might as well go ahead and dry

270
00:10:54,639 --> 00:10:59,759
them anyway and uh it's easier to handle

271
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:59,759
that way

272
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:03,919
there are several advantages of this

273
00:11:01,879 --> 00:11:06,278
foler testing and I alluded to them

274
00:11:03,919 --> 00:11:07,719
already uh standardization of analyses

275
00:11:06,278 --> 00:11:10,639
we don't have this difference from Lab

276
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:12,639
to lab if you send leaves to one lab you

277
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:14,278
get results back they ought to be the

278
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:16,600
same results they're really close to it

279
00:11:14,278 --> 00:11:18,799
as another lab now the recommendations

280
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:20,240
might be different we'll talk about

281
00:11:18,799 --> 00:11:22,759
those at the next webinar but the

282
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:25,240
numbers ought to be pretty much the

283
00:11:22,759 --> 00:11:26,759
same better indicator of nutrient status

284
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:29,440
than a soil

285
00:11:26,759 --> 00:11:31,879
test the thing I like about it is that

286
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:33,600
can identify potential problems before

287
00:11:31,879 --> 00:11:35,838
they result in visible symptoms or

288
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:38,600
reduced growth in yield so it's just

289
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:40,560
like the cholesterol test of your blood

290
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:42,720
you can detect high cholesterol before

291
00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:44,518
you know anything's even wrong with you

292
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:47,278
before you have that heart attack or

293
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:48,759
hearten of the arteries or whatever and

294
00:11:47,278 --> 00:11:50,600
it can help diagnose a problem if you

295
00:11:48,759 --> 00:11:52,200
see something that doesn't look right in

296
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:54,399
your field off color plants aren't

297
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:57,000
growing well uh you don't think it's a

298
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:58,399
virus or you just don't know what it is

299
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,720
you can just sample from that area and

300
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:02,399
at least get a sense of whether

301
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:02,399
nutrients are

302
00:12:02,679 --> 00:12:07,879
involvedin

303
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:11,000
you s there's a question on how do you

304
00:12:07,879 --> 00:12:12,919
uh suggest to dry the

305
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,879
sample I don't think you have to do

306
00:12:12,919 --> 00:12:16,519
anything special to dry it just put it

307
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:19,240
in a bag and you know leave it in a

308
00:12:16,519 --> 00:12:21,679
window seal or or just send it in the

309
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:23,480
way it is put it on a radiator I don't

310
00:12:21,679 --> 00:12:26,319
know it just has to be dry we just don't

311
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:28,000
want to get them all you know in a

312
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:31,160
plastic bag where it's really wet and

313
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,159
they start to mold

314
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:39,198
so there are several shortcomings of

315
00:12:35,679 --> 00:12:40,759
foler testing and one is these aren't

316
00:12:39,198 --> 00:12:43,399
real big shortcomings but they're you

317
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:45,360
should be aware of it it provides the

318
00:12:43,399 --> 00:12:47,078
total amount of an element not the

319
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:49,000
amount that is in a biologically active

320
00:12:47,078 --> 00:12:51,958
form and for

321
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:54,480
certain mineral elements we have

322
00:12:51,958 --> 00:12:56,838
biologically active and inactive forms

323
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:58,039
and iron is one of those that's probably

324
00:12:56,839 --> 00:13:00,079
the most important of the mineral

325
00:12:58,039 --> 00:13:02,000
elements that occur in two forms and if

326
00:13:00,078 --> 00:13:04,198
you had you know high school chemistry

327
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:07,679
or college chemistry you might remember

328
00:13:04,198 --> 00:13:10,000
that iron is a a divalent ion it comes

329
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:13,120
in two forms there's a plus two form and

330
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:15,000
a plus three form in Plants it's the

331
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:16,240
plus two form that's active and not the

332
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,278
plus three

333
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:21,480
form so ideally we want to know when we

334
00:13:19,278 --> 00:13:24,559
measure iron how much iron is in the

335
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:26,039
plus two form but the ICP doesn't tell

336
00:13:24,559 --> 00:13:28,559
us that it just tells us what the total

337
00:13:26,039 --> 00:13:31,319
amount of iron is so there are

338
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:33,239
situations where we can see that iron

339
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:35,920
levels look like they're high or

340
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:38,480
adequate but really uh we have symptoms

341
00:13:35,919 --> 00:13:41,278
of iron chlorosis because most of the

342
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:44,278
iron is not in the correct form and we

343
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:46,799
talked about this two webinars ago we

344
00:13:44,278 --> 00:13:49,439
talked about blueberries in high calcium

345
00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:51,879
soils how the calcium pushes a lot of

346
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:54,720
the iron in the plant to the plus three

347
00:13:51,879 --> 00:13:57,720
form where it's not really active so on

348
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:59,480
a blueberry plant showing iron chlorosis

349
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:01,320
you might see that you have adequate

350
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:04,120
iron but really you still have iron

351
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:07,079
chlorosis because it's not in the right

352
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:08,440
form the other shortcoming is that we're

353
00:14:07,078 --> 00:14:10,919
sampling at one time of the year when

354
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:13,199
the the values of these nutrients tend

355
00:14:10,919 --> 00:14:16,240
to be the most stable but that might not

356
00:14:13,198 --> 00:14:18,000
be the most ideal time for all elements

357
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:19,959
it might be for certain elements that

358
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:23,399
it's better to sample first thing in the

359
00:14:19,958 --> 00:14:26,039
spring or maybe going into the fall but

360
00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:29,559
it's too expensive to do these samplings

361
00:14:26,039 --> 00:14:31,719
over multiple times and the way the ICP

362
00:14:29,559 --> 00:14:33,679
analysis works it does all the nutrients

363
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:35,160
at one shot just runs it through and

364
00:14:33,679 --> 00:14:37,359
they get a print out of everything at

365
00:14:35,159 --> 00:14:39,879
one time so it's not like we do each

366
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:41,919
element individually so each time we do

367
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:44,480
a test it's expensive you know it's 20

368
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:46,000
to $30 so we don't want to be doing that

369
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:48,000
multiple times during the season unless

370
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,559
we have a really good reason for it and

371
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,078
most of the standards have been

372
00:14:49,559 --> 00:14:53,719
developed for just those times of the

373
00:14:51,078 --> 00:14:56,239
year that we talked about earlier but it

374
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:58,519
might not be ideal for everything and

375
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:00,959
then uh thirdly it doesn't mean that if

376
00:14:58,519 --> 00:15:03,159
you do a a leaf test foler test you can

377
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:05,758
avoid doing a soil test we still need

378
00:15:03,159 --> 00:15:07,159
that soil test to be meaningful at the

379
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:10,278
next webinar we will'll give you some

380
00:15:07,159 --> 00:15:13,439
examples of how just looking at a foler

381
00:15:10,278 --> 00:15:15,720
test uh you can maybe draw some wrong

382
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:18,759
conclusions until you look at that soil

383
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:20,720
test and we talked in previous webinars

384
00:15:18,759 --> 00:15:24,800
about how the pH has a big impact on

385
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:27,959
what the plants take up these foler

386
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:31,639
tests are really only good if the soil

387
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:31,638
pH is within the rain that we

388
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:37,039
recommend the other shortcoming of a

389
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:38,638
foler analysis it doesn't really measure

390
00:15:37,039 --> 00:15:40,519
interactions among elements that can

391
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:42,600
affect activity and

392
00:15:40,519 --> 00:15:45,639
bioavailability so we know for example

393
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:47,399
that potassium can be if pottassium is

394
00:15:45,639 --> 00:15:49,799
really high in the plant it can reduce

395
00:15:47,399 --> 00:15:52,198
the activity of magnesium so again a

396
00:15:49,799 --> 00:15:53,799
leaf analysis might show the Magnesium

397
00:15:52,198 --> 00:15:56,559
is adequate but if the potassium is

398
00:15:53,799 --> 00:16:00,078
really high that magnesium activity

399
00:15:56,559 --> 00:16:02,838
might be suppressed so doesn't behave as

400
00:16:00,078 --> 00:16:05,120
if magnesium is adequate uh other

401
00:16:02,839 --> 00:16:07,959
well-known interactions are iron and

402
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:10,240
phosphorus zinc and phosphorus and we

403
00:16:07,958 --> 00:16:11,599
already mentioned calcium and iron how

404
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,959
they're antagonistic particularly in

405
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,920
blueberries when we're trying to grow

406
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:15,919
things a lower

407
00:16:17,679 --> 00:16:26,838
pH there's another question mvin on

408
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:29,039
ph and should should the soil PH be

409
00:16:26,839 --> 00:16:32,199
sampled at the same time as the leaves

410
00:16:29,039 --> 00:16:34,679
or do you just use your most recent soil

411
00:16:32,198 --> 00:16:37,639
test you can use your most recent soil

412
00:16:34,679 --> 00:16:40,278
test the soil PH isn't going to change

413
00:16:37,639 --> 00:16:41,480
that much um over a period of months

414
00:16:40,278 --> 00:16:43,519
unless you've added a lot of lime or

415
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:45,278
sulfur recently but just your standard

416
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:48,360
soil test it's going to be pretty much

417
00:16:45,278 --> 00:16:50,078
the same in the spring as it is in uh or

418
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:52,039
and fall as it would even be the next

419
00:16:50,078 --> 00:16:54,519
year when you do your Leaf analysis in

420
00:16:52,039 --> 00:16:56,480
August so your most recent soil task

421
00:16:54,519 --> 00:17:00,078
will be adequate for determining that

422
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:00,079
range that you need

423
00:17:04,759 --> 00:17:09,400
uh a caveat when we're talking about

424
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:11,639
these nutrients and deficiencies and all

425
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:13,880
is that usually more than one nutrient

426
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:16,360
is deficient at a time it's pretty

427
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:19,880
unusual to just to see one by itself

428
00:17:16,359 --> 00:17:22,639
although you can see it but often times

429
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:24,600
conditions that induce

430
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:27,240
deficiencies impacting more than just

431
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:30,399
one nutrient and a simple example would

432
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:32,839
be a high pH if you put on too much line

433
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:35,240
and you kick that ph up too high you'll

434
00:17:32,839 --> 00:17:38,879
see simultaneous deficiencies of iron

435
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:38,880
manganese copper bronze zinc and

436
00:17:42,359 --> 00:17:46,918
phosphorus there are a bunch of

437
00:17:44,279 --> 00:17:50,038
essential elements in plants and they're

438
00:17:46,919 --> 00:17:52,200
all important because they all uh carry

439
00:17:50,038 --> 00:17:54,440
out functions that are

440
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:56,360
critical and I'm not going to read

441
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:58,480
through all these but uh you can glance

442
00:17:56,359 --> 00:17:59,599
at the chart and see that wow there's a

443
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:03,240
lot of things things that happen in a

444
00:17:59,599 --> 00:18:06,319
plant biochemically and these elements

445
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:10,599
have big impacts on that

446
00:18:06,319 --> 00:18:13,200
um pointing out U potassium is the only

447
00:18:10,599 --> 00:18:16,199
one that's not really um incorporated

448
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:19,240
into the plant itself it's not really

449
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:21,440
part of enzymes it's not part of DNA

450
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:23,200
it's not part of cell structure very

451
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:26,440
much it's mainly used for osmo

452
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:29,480
regulation and for catalyzing enzyme

453
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:32,279
reactions more than 50 enzymes in a

454
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:35,159
plant are activated by potassium it

455
00:18:32,279 --> 00:18:37,918
helps open and close stomates U so it's

456
00:18:35,159 --> 00:18:40,360
really important in photosynthesis but

457
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:43,159
it's not incorporated into parts of the

458
00:18:40,359 --> 00:18:46,240
plant most of these other ones are

459
00:18:43,159 --> 00:18:48,280
Incorporated to some extent a mum mostly

460
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:49,359
for enzyme activation but it's kind of

461
00:18:48,279 --> 00:18:52,158
interesting to look and see how the

462
00:18:49,359 --> 00:18:54,399
plants have evolved to use these

463
00:18:52,159 --> 00:18:55,960
essential elements in so many diverse

464
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:58,480
ways and it all kind of works together

465
00:18:55,960 --> 00:19:00,679
and makes sense and plants grow pretty

466
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:02,839
fast

467
00:19:00,679 --> 00:19:05,080
stuff other essential nutrients that

468
00:19:02,839 --> 00:19:07,678
weren't on that chart were meibum

469
00:19:05,079 --> 00:19:09,319
chlorine and nickel these were among the

470
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:10,798
most recently discovered essential

471
00:19:09,319 --> 00:19:14,639
nutrients people didn't really know they

472
00:19:10,798 --> 00:19:17,240
were critical until fairly recently but

473
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:20,200
they're only really uh necessary in very

474
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:21,679
small amounts in fact the amounts are so

475
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:24,720
small that experimentally it was

476
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:26,679
actually hard to grow plants in media

477
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:30,519
that didn't contain at least a tiny

478
00:19:26,679 --> 00:19:30,519
amount of nickel or mum

479
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:36,400
in certain other plants not all plants

480
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:39,320
sodium selenium Cobalt and silicon are

481
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:41,200
essential nutrients but not in the berry

482
00:19:39,319 --> 00:19:45,079
crops we're going to be talking about so

483
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:47,200
we don't worry about those four except

484
00:19:45,079 --> 00:19:50,279
maybe selenium and sodium in situations

485
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:53,319
where we have too much or in toxic

486
00:19:50,279 --> 00:19:55,960
situations but um if we have zero of

487
00:19:53,319 --> 00:19:57,200
those uh we never would have but if

488
00:19:55,960 --> 00:20:00,640
theoretically if we would it wouldn't

489
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,640
make an impact on the plant

490
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:08,959
this chart here shows that relative

491
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:12,120
concentrations of the various uh

492
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:16,640
nutrients and atoms in healthy plant

493
00:20:12,119 --> 00:20:18,479
tissue relative to niol malum which if

494
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:21,400
there's one atom of nickel and one atom

495
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:24,200
of libum we would have about two of

496
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:26,759
cobalt 100 of copper 300 zinc and you

497
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:28,120
can read through that all the way up to

498
00:20:26,759 --> 00:20:30,558
where we're getting to into like

499
00:20:28,119 --> 00:20:34,319
nitrogen we'd have a million atoms of

500
00:20:30,558 --> 00:20:37,359
nitrogen for every atom of mum or nickel

501
00:20:34,319 --> 00:20:40,558
U 30 million oxygen 40 million carbon 60

502
00:20:37,359 --> 00:20:44,719
million hydrogen so one of the

503
00:20:40,558 --> 00:20:47,319
challenges in leaf analysis is a tested

504
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:51,319
measures concentration across such a

505
00:20:47,319 --> 00:20:52,720
wide range of like a millionfold range

506
00:20:51,319 --> 00:20:54,839
of nutrient

507
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:57,240
concentrations and I think we're

508
00:20:54,839 --> 00:21:01,158
fortunate we have technology that allows

509
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:05,038
us to do it as cheaply as we do or

510
00:21:01,159 --> 00:21:05,039
nutrients across such a wide wide

511
00:21:08,798 --> 00:21:14,720
range visual symptoms of

512
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:17,600
deficiencies now certain nutrients are

513
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:19,960
extremely Mobile in the plant and this

514
00:21:17,599 --> 00:21:21,678
characteristic can help diagnose the

515
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:26,319
visual symptoms that you might

516
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:29,559
see so there are five nutrients that are

517
00:21:26,319 --> 00:21:32,599
really very mobile nitrogen phosphorus

518
00:21:29,558 --> 00:21:35,359
potassium magnesium and

519
00:21:32,599 --> 00:21:38,798
sulfur since they're immobile they will

520
00:21:35,359 --> 00:21:43,119
tend to move out of the leaf into the

521
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:46,839
flum and into the growing points so as

522
00:21:43,119 --> 00:21:49,759
you recall the xylm is what pulls water

523
00:21:46,839 --> 00:21:52,759
into the plant and with it it pulls in

524
00:21:49,759 --> 00:21:55,879
some nutrients it goes up the xylm into

525
00:21:52,759 --> 00:21:58,720
the leaf where all this biochemical

526
00:21:55,880 --> 00:22:01,159
activity happens sugars are made

527
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:03,919
photosynthesis and then the nutrients

528
00:22:01,159 --> 00:22:06,080
the amino acids that are made the uh

529
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:08,038
nutrients that need to go to the growing

530
00:22:06,079 --> 00:22:09,480
points are pumped out through the flum

531
00:22:08,038 --> 00:22:14,079
and they go preferentially to the

532
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:18,720
growing points so if you see a plant

533
00:22:14,079 --> 00:22:21,199
that has U odd colors and old leaves but

534
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:23,079
the new leaves seem to be healthy in

535
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:25,919
vious it's just these old leaves are are

536
00:22:23,079 --> 00:22:28,798
turning yellow or doing funky things

537
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:31,038
that's almost always a deficiency in NPK

538
00:22:28,798 --> 00:22:34,119
magnesium or sulfur because they're

539
00:22:31,038 --> 00:22:36,599
movable if we see the opposite if we see

540
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:40,599
the young leaves showing deficiencies in

541
00:22:36,599 --> 00:22:42,119
the old leaves not that usually implies

542
00:22:40,599 --> 00:22:44,319
it's one of the other nutrients because

543
00:22:42,119 --> 00:22:47,439
they're less mobile and we'll look at

544
00:22:44,319 --> 00:22:47,439
some pictures of these in a

545
00:22:48,558 --> 00:22:55,720
minute wanted to show you some uh sap

546
00:22:53,319 --> 00:22:58,158
values of of substances that when you

547
00:22:55,720 --> 00:23:00,919
squeeze the sap out of the plant what

548
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:03,760
you get yet and this this is separated

549
00:23:00,919 --> 00:23:06,720
based on xylm sap and flum

550
00:23:03,759 --> 00:23:08,519
sap and the xylm is what comes in from

551
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:10,440
the roots and goes up through the plant

552
00:23:08,519 --> 00:23:13,278
into the leaf and then the FL as what

553
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:15,558
comes out of the leaf so let's look at a

554
00:23:13,278 --> 00:23:17,519
few of these let's look at sugars to

555
00:23:15,558 --> 00:23:20,278
begin with just to give you a a feel for

556
00:23:17,519 --> 00:23:22,319
how the plant works you know the plant

557
00:23:20,278 --> 00:23:24,880
doesn't take sugar out of the soil

558
00:23:22,319 --> 00:23:28,519
there's zero sugar in the

559
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:32,200
xylm but when it leaves a leaf in the

560
00:23:28,519 --> 00:23:33,839
flum there's lots of sugar there so

561
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:36,278
Sally you know the water is coming up

562
00:23:33,839 --> 00:23:37,879
through the xylm into the flum into the

563
00:23:36,278 --> 00:23:40,079
leaf where sugar is made and then that's

564
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:43,360
pumped out the FL so we see those big

565
00:23:40,079 --> 00:23:43,359
differences between the xylm and

566
00:23:44,679 --> 00:23:51,559
Flo talked the last few webinars about

567
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:54,720
nitrate as a fertilizer this is an

568
00:23:51,558 --> 00:23:57,158
example of uh the Zim versus the flo

569
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:59,519
when you fertilize a plant with nitrate

570
00:23:57,159 --> 00:24:02,600
sources of nitrogen the nitrate goes

571
00:23:59,519 --> 00:24:04,519
into the plant and um it's dissolved in

572
00:24:02,599 --> 00:24:06,519
the water it goes into the plant so it

573
00:24:04,519 --> 00:24:09,400
goes right into the plant up through the

574
00:24:06,519 --> 00:24:11,879
root into the vascular system into the

575
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:13,720
leaf at fairly high

576
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:16,960
concentrations but when it comes out of

577
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:19,319
the leaf there's none of it nitrate

578
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:21,480
doesn't move through the flow when it's

579
00:24:19,319 --> 00:24:24,639
in the leaf it's

580
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:26,519
converted through nitrate reductase into

581
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:29,000
amino

582
00:24:26,519 --> 00:24:32,558
acids and ammonia

583
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:35,519
compounds nh4 compounds so when it comes

584
00:24:32,558 --> 00:24:39,918
out of the leaf what we see our values

585
00:24:35,519 --> 00:24:42,798
over here being high and up here amino

586
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:45,880
acids H4 but not nitrated itself because

587
00:24:42,798 --> 00:24:45,879
that conversion happens in the

588
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:54,320
Lea there's been some work on

589
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:56,640
determining nitrogen needs by measuring

590
00:24:54,319 --> 00:24:59,639
the pedal sap concentration of nitrate

591
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:02,120
you may have heard about uh pedial

592
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:05,320
nitrate analysis or pedial sap

593
00:25:02,119 --> 00:25:09,239
analysis uh what people are trying to do

594
00:25:05,319 --> 00:25:09,240
is they're trying to look at this value

595
00:25:09,759 --> 00:25:16,000
here determine the nitrogen needs of the

596
00:25:13,759 --> 00:25:17,599
plant and they've done this with

597
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,759
strawberry particularly to see if it

598
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:22,000
works if they can get correlations with

599
00:25:19,759 --> 00:25:24,398
the total nitrogen needs of the plant

600
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:27,079
but a few problems with it one is this

601
00:25:24,398 --> 00:25:29,519
isn't the type of nitrogen that the

602
00:25:27,079 --> 00:25:32,678
plant uses the plant us uses this type

603
00:25:29,519 --> 00:25:34,440
of nitrogen in fact that nitrate isn't

604
00:25:32,679 --> 00:25:36,200
going to the growing point so it's

605
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:38,759
coming in but it's not necessarily going

606
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:40,440
out of leaf so is this really the best

607
00:25:38,759 --> 00:25:42,879
indicator of the plant's nutritional

608
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:45,000
status it's a measure of nitrogen

609
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:47,559
availability but not necessarily

610
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,558
nitrogen

611
00:25:48,759 --> 00:25:54,038
use so it's not necessarily correlated

612
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:56,320
with the active form of nitrogen when we

613
00:25:54,038 --> 00:25:57,558
look at the sap concentration and the

614
00:25:56,319 --> 00:26:00,359
other thing that happens is the

615
00:25:57,558 --> 00:26:03,240
concentration is really dependent on the

616
00:26:00,359 --> 00:26:06,678
flow of water in the xylm so after it

617
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:08,558
rains the value of nitrate in the xylm

618
00:26:06,679 --> 00:26:10,159
is low and then when it starts to dry

619
00:26:08,558 --> 00:26:12,839
out and the plant's not taking up as

620
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:16,360
much water the concentration of nitrate

621
00:26:12,839 --> 00:26:19,439
goes up so on a day-to-day basis those

622
00:26:16,359 --> 00:26:20,959
values and the sap and the zym change so

623
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:23,278
it's really hard to say whether

624
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:25,840
something's you know deficient or not or

625
00:26:23,278 --> 00:26:28,319
needs more nitrogen just based on these

626
00:26:25,839 --> 00:26:31,319
snapshot pictures at one point in time

627
00:26:28,319 --> 00:26:35,558
in this really variable concentration so

628
00:26:31,319 --> 00:26:37,439
for certain crops uh this pedal analysis

629
00:26:35,558 --> 00:26:39,599
people are using it like in corn and

630
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:41,759
some of the annual crops but in

631
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:44,000
perennial crops it hasn't really caught

632
00:26:41,759 --> 00:26:46,319
on because each time you take a sample

633
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,278
you got to run a expensive test it's not

634
00:26:46,319 --> 00:26:50,519
always correlated as variable I just

635
00:26:48,278 --> 00:26:52,759
wanted to mention that as you probably

636
00:26:50,519 --> 00:26:56,440
have heard of it

637
00:26:52,759 --> 00:27:00,798
before go back to these ranges for sap

638
00:26:56,440 --> 00:27:03,000
again let look at the if we look at xylm

639
00:27:00,798 --> 00:27:06,319
phosphorus we see that it comes into the

640
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:08,159
plant at a fairly low concentration it

641
00:27:06,319 --> 00:27:09,278
goes out of the leaf into the flo at a

642
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:11,760
fairly High

643
00:27:09,278 --> 00:27:14,000
concentration so phosphorus is fairly

644
00:27:11,759 --> 00:27:15,839
mobile comes in it's accumulating leaf

645
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:18,159
and it's sent out at high concentrations

646
00:27:15,839 --> 00:27:21,720
to the growing points Fosters very

647
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:21,720
mobile nutrient in the

648
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:27,159
plant same as pottassium potassium is

649
00:27:24,919 --> 00:27:30,038
really mobile comes into the

650
00:27:27,159 --> 00:27:31,399
plant through the dissolve through being

651
00:27:30,038 --> 00:27:34,158
dissolved in the water comes into the

652
00:27:31,398 --> 00:27:36,798
plant goes up the zylin into the leaf

653
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:38,840
it's concentrated to a great extent sent

654
00:27:36,798 --> 00:27:41,759
out the flow at high concentrations

655
00:27:38,839 --> 00:27:44,558
again these growing points the filling

656
00:27:41,759 --> 00:27:47,000
the fruit this is all really intensive

657
00:27:44,558 --> 00:27:50,558
for potassium plays a big role in that

658
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,558
so we see high concentrations in the

659
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:57,720
flow

660
00:27:53,519 --> 00:28:00,079
calcium calcium is just the opposite it

661
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:02,679
comes in to the plant through dissolved

662
00:28:00,079 --> 00:28:05,439
water through mass flow it goes out the

663
00:28:02,679 --> 00:28:08,240
flo at even lower concentrations and it

664
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:10,798
comes into the plant through the

665
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:12,960
dissolved W through the dissolved water

666
00:28:10,798 --> 00:28:15,200
so it's not a very mobile nutrient in

667
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:18,519
the plant so when we look for

668
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:21,600
deficiencies of calcium we see calcium

669
00:28:18,519 --> 00:28:25,159
deficiencies develop at the extremities

670
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:26,359
of the plant where it just doesn't move

671
00:28:25,159 --> 00:28:28,640
through very well it doesn't move

672
00:28:26,359 --> 00:28:31,319
through that floam and and gets to the

673
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:34,720
extremities it's just it doesn't move

674
00:28:31,319 --> 00:28:37,480
through the plant um very well so it's

675
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:37,480
not a very mobile

676
00:28:41,398 --> 00:28:46,319
nutrient so let's start looking at some

677
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:49,559
of these photographs and uh see if we

678
00:28:46,319 --> 00:28:51,079
can't figure something out uh based on

679
00:28:49,558 --> 00:28:54,038
uh the plant and the behavior of the

680
00:28:51,079 --> 00:28:56,839
nutrient so something fairly simple um

681
00:28:54,038 --> 00:28:58,759
blueberry here uh a plant with adequate

682
00:28:56,839 --> 00:29:00,678
nitrogen

683
00:28:58,759 --> 00:29:02,640
and a plant with inadequate nitrogen and

684
00:29:00,679 --> 00:29:04,519
most people are trained enough they can

685
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:06,720
look at the color of the plant and they

686
00:29:04,519 --> 00:29:08,359
can say wellow that's just that green

687
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:10,839
just tells me that there's not enough

688
00:29:08,359 --> 00:29:14,479
nitrogen in the plant and the leaves are

689
00:29:10,839 --> 00:29:17,798
smaller they tend to be yellower um in

690
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:20,319
some plants like strawberry The Leaf

691
00:29:17,798 --> 00:29:22,599
color a little bit more red than light

692
00:29:20,319 --> 00:29:25,119
green and more advanced stages of

693
00:29:22,599 --> 00:29:25,119
nitrogen

694
00:29:26,679 --> 00:29:31,159
deficiency this is a field of

695
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:34,120
strawberries that was sort of abandoned

696
00:29:31,159 --> 00:29:36,679
the grower wasn't didn't renovate it uh

697
00:29:34,119 --> 00:29:39,319
hadn't probably fertilized it since last

698
00:29:36,679 --> 00:29:41,720
year renovation and so the leaves are

699
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:46,439
starting to show this reddish yellowish

700
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:46,440
light green color indicating nitrogen

701
00:29:49,839 --> 00:29:55,759
deficiency sulfur is a deficiency that

702
00:29:54,398 --> 00:29:58,798
mimics

703
00:29:55,759 --> 00:30:01,679
nitrogen it's um s suur is a component

704
00:29:58,798 --> 00:30:04,359
of amino acids just like nitrogen a bulk

705
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:06,080
of nitrogen is in amino acids and so the

706
00:30:04,359 --> 00:30:08,319
two are actually in parallel they both

707
00:30:06,079 --> 00:30:10,879
are com comprised amino acids it's just

708
00:30:08,319 --> 00:30:14,038
that sulfur is needed in a lot lower

709
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:17,399
amount than nitrogen and as I mentioned

710
00:30:14,038 --> 00:30:20,038
earlier sulfates and sulfur are pretty

711
00:30:17,398 --> 00:30:22,839
ubiquitous around the world uh a lot of

712
00:30:20,038 --> 00:30:25,278
a lot of our soils uh have sulfates in

713
00:30:22,839 --> 00:30:26,558
them there's lots of sulfur in the soil

714
00:30:25,278 --> 00:30:29,200
we live in an area where there's

715
00:30:26,558 --> 00:30:32,038
deposition of sufur in the rainfall

716
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:35,480
because we still burn coal and stuff and

717
00:30:32,038 --> 00:30:37,519
that you know sulfur dioxide floats over

718
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:42,159
the Northeast and when it rains sulfur

719
00:30:37,519 --> 00:30:44,240
comes down um fertilizers contain sulfur

720
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:46,559
so even though we don't measure real

721
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:49,640
well and a lot of soil tests don't show

722
00:30:46,558 --> 00:30:50,960
sulfur even on the result uh usually we

723
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:54,038
just don't worry about it would only be

724
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:55,919
in situations where the soils are are

725
00:30:54,038 --> 00:30:58,879
real Sandy and there's a lot of rainfall

726
00:30:55,919 --> 00:31:01,080
we might run into a sulfur deficiency

727
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:03,600
but the symptoms look very similar to

728
00:31:01,079 --> 00:31:05,000
what they look like if nitrogen was

729
00:31:03,599 --> 00:31:09,079
deficient because the principle is the

730
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:09,079
same you short on amino acids and

731
00:31:12,638 --> 00:31:18,839
chlorophyll phospherous deficiency it's

732
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:20,679
pretty similar in most plants they

733
00:31:18,839 --> 00:31:22,678
develop the same kind of symptoms with

734
00:31:20,679 --> 00:31:25,159
phosphorus deficiency in that is the

735
00:31:22,679 --> 00:31:27,519
first on is usually the leaves turn a

736
00:31:25,159 --> 00:31:29,919
dark green or serve they get this dark

737
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:29,919
red

738
00:31:32,119 --> 00:31:39,638
coloration and um here you can see on

739
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:42,558
the margins of the leaves it mild

740
00:31:39,638 --> 00:31:45,000
deficiencies that just starts to develop

741
00:31:42,558 --> 00:31:48,480
along the edges this dark color and

742
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:52,519
eventually the whole Leaf will get dark

743
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:55,880
red and on blueberry again just a darker

744
00:31:52,519 --> 00:31:57,000
color than would be normal um even you

745
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:59,399
can just sort of tell when you look at

746
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:01,278
that plant that it's more than just you

747
00:31:59,398 --> 00:32:05,000
know too much nitrogen it's just a

748
00:32:01,278 --> 00:32:06,359
darker green um and again when you you

749
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,278
know look at the leaf you'll see that

750
00:32:06,359 --> 00:32:10,798
phosphorus is

751
00:32:08,278 --> 00:32:13,240
low we don't usually have too much

752
00:32:10,798 --> 00:32:15,599
phosphorus deficiency in our soils in

753
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:17,919
the Northeast particularly because there

754
00:32:15,599 --> 00:32:19,879
are a lot of dairy farms around and

755
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:21,639
people you know spread manure and manure

756
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:23,919
has a lot of phosphorus in it a lot of

757
00:32:21,638 --> 00:32:26,199
the rocks have a lot of phosphorus in it

758
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:28,159
it's not that common that I see a soil

759
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:30,840
test or I'm sorry a leaf analysis come

760
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:33,519
back where phosphorus is really low

761
00:32:30,839 --> 00:32:37,079
usually it's adequate or maybe close to

762
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:37,079
being low but not really seriously

763
00:32:38,679 --> 00:32:44,559
deficient however uh this nutrient here

764
00:32:41,638 --> 00:32:46,038
at potassium we do see deficiency

765
00:32:44,558 --> 00:32:47,720
symptoms

766
00:32:46,038 --> 00:32:51,240
occasionally this is of course

767
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:54,440
strawberry and the first sign of

768
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:58,880
deficiency is often a little bit of

769
00:32:54,440 --> 00:33:02,240
Browning where the leaflet attaches the

770
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:04,480
pedal and the leaf gets a little

771
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:06,519
blotchy see here and you can see over

772
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:09,839
here it just it's dark green in places

773
00:33:06,519 --> 00:33:12,679
as light green in places and then as

774
00:33:09,839 --> 00:33:15,000
time goes on you get a little bit more

775
00:33:12,679 --> 00:33:16,559
marginal burning and here you can see

776
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:19,558
along the edge you get this marginal

777
00:33:16,558 --> 00:33:21,798
burning you can see the darker color the

778
00:33:19,558 --> 00:33:24,638
lighter color and then marginal burning

779
00:33:21,798 --> 00:33:26,960
very indicative of potassium deficiency

780
00:33:24,638 --> 00:33:28,719
and since potassium is a very mobile

781
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:30,600
nutrient in the plant

782
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:33,079
you see the symptoms developing on the

783
00:33:30,599 --> 00:33:35,240
older leaves first same would be true

784
00:33:33,079 --> 00:33:37,000
with phosphorus the older leaves first

785
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:39,200
because it's a mobile nutrient within

786
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,200
the

787
00:33:39,319 --> 00:33:45,439
plant and out in the field potassium

788
00:33:43,319 --> 00:33:49,079
deficiency again that marginal burning

789
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:49,080
is very indicative of

790
00:33:49,638 --> 00:33:54,839
that and blueberries marginal

791
00:33:55,798 --> 00:34:00,720
burning then marginal burning

792
00:33:58,759 --> 00:34:01,440
you test these leaves they're very low

793
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:04,159
in

794
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:06,720
potassium so that's common symptom in

795
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:06,720
almost every

796
00:34:07,078 --> 00:34:13,199
plant okay look at what Calcium

797
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:16,559
deficiency looks like now if you recall

798
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:18,199
I said that calcium does not move very

799
00:34:16,559 --> 00:34:20,759
well in the

800
00:34:18,199 --> 00:34:21,918
plant it can move through the plant in

801
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:24,440
two different ways and come up through

802
00:34:21,918 --> 00:34:27,199
the xylem move into leaf or it can be

803
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:28,358
pushed through the flm into the growing

804
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:32,319
points

805
00:34:28,358 --> 00:34:35,319
the problem here is

806
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:38,679
that the growing points themselves when

807
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:41,720
calcium is in short supply the calcium

808
00:34:38,679 --> 00:34:44,119
just doesn't get out to the tips so real

809
00:34:41,719 --> 00:34:47,279
distinctive Calcium deficiency you see

810
00:34:44,119 --> 00:34:49,000
the growing points turning brown they

811
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:52,119
don't have enough calcium here you see

812
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:53,719
it here you see it here there's just not

813
00:34:52,119 --> 00:34:56,200
enough calcium getting

814
00:34:53,719 --> 00:34:59,319
out it doesn't move through the floam

815
00:34:56,199 --> 00:35:01,879
very well anyway and and if you have

816
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:03,480
cloudy humid conditions it doesn't move

817
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:06,000
through the zylon very well either

818
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:08,760
because transpiration is shut down

819
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:10,440
whenever it's cool and cloudy and humid

820
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:12,280
so you're not sucking water into the

821
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:14,440
plant and bringing calcium in through

822
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:16,320
mass flow and it doesn't move through

823
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:18,679
the floam very well anyway so the

824
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:21,760
growing points are the first things that

825
00:35:18,679 --> 00:35:24,039
suffer when calcium is in short

826
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:26,560
supply and because it's not a very

827
00:35:24,039 --> 00:35:28,880
mobile nutrient we also see it on the

828
00:35:26,559 --> 00:35:31,599
new growth first before we see it on the

829
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:33,640
El growth so here is a new Leaf coming

830
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:35,320
out of a strawberry plant it's already

831
00:35:33,639 --> 00:35:37,480
impacted by low calcium it's already

832
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:40,440
turning brown and black and it hasn't

833
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:43,280
even emerged yet the older leaves on the

834
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:45,400
strawberry plant would have been fine

835
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:47,040
because they already got their calcium

836
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:49,559
calcium doesn't move out of leaf so

837
00:35:47,039 --> 00:35:51,318
they're hanging on to it um so they look

838
00:35:49,559 --> 00:35:53,799
fine but these new leaves under the

839
00:35:51,318 --> 00:35:57,880
short calcium Supply show the symptoms

840
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:57,880
because the calcium is not remobilized

841
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,920
and here we see a runner tip again

842
00:35:59,838 --> 00:36:03,519
another common place so you'll see

843
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:06,440
Calcium deficiency showing up you see

844
00:36:03,519 --> 00:36:09,119
this necrosis of the tips and the

845
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:12,838
runners are way out there it's hard for

846
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:16,079
calcium to get out that far along this

847
00:36:12,838 --> 00:36:19,279
Runner so you'll see symptoms showing up

848
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:19,280
here as

849
00:36:22,519 --> 00:36:30,800
well a magnesium magnesium is similar to

850
00:36:26,838 --> 00:36:32,599
calcium is both a a dent cation but

851
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:33,480
magnesium is more Mobile in the plant

852
00:36:32,599 --> 00:36:36,599
than

853
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:39,358
calcium so uh doesn't quite have that

854
00:36:36,599 --> 00:36:43,760
same tendency to show up in the newer

855
00:36:39,358 --> 00:36:47,598
growth first but C magnesium and almost

856
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:51,319
all plants shows a pretty distinctive uh

857
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:54,680
symptom and that is you get inter venal

858
00:36:51,318 --> 00:36:58,239
coloring and eventually Browning so on

859
00:36:54,679 --> 00:37:00,078
this blueberry plant we can see that the

860
00:36:58,239 --> 00:37:03,039
color between the veins is kind of red

861
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:05,318
and the veins Stay Green very common in

862
00:37:03,039 --> 00:37:08,679
plants with magnesium deficiency green

863
00:37:05,318 --> 00:37:10,880
veins discolored inter veinal areas

864
00:37:08,679 --> 00:37:12,719
first thing to think of is magnesium

865
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:15,680
deficiency and we call this sort of the

866
00:37:12,719 --> 00:37:17,239
Christmas tree pattern because it's got

867
00:37:15,679 --> 00:37:20,199
the green almost like a Christmas tree

868
00:37:17,239 --> 00:37:20,199
and in between is

869
00:37:22,239 --> 00:37:27,519
red here we have the beginnings of

870
00:37:24,519 --> 00:37:29,159
magnesium deficiency on strawberry

871
00:37:27,519 --> 00:37:31,000
unlike blueberry we don't get that

872
00:37:29,159 --> 00:37:34,199
really strong red color in between the

873
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:36,480
veins but we do get inter vinal

874
00:37:34,199 --> 00:37:38,519
coloring not on the veins but in between

875
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:42,000
the veins and as we go to a little bit

876
00:37:38,519 --> 00:37:44,759
more severe situation we can see the in

877
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:47,079
between the veins actually turn

878
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:49,240
brown but almost anytime you see this

879
00:37:47,079 --> 00:37:51,280
inter vinal Browning and it's a nutrient

880
00:37:49,239 --> 00:37:54,078
deficiency you know oh that's magnesium

881
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:54,079
because that's how

882
00:37:54,760 --> 00:38:01,960
behaves Marvin Jeff from on had a

883
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:04,720
question on the um going back to Calcium

884
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:06,920
deficiency okay on the strawberries and

885
00:38:04,719 --> 00:38:08,239
whether the I think the first picture

886
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:12,000
you showed showed a little bit of

887
00:38:08,239 --> 00:38:15,838
cupping is that a symptom of the Calcium

888
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:18,318
deficiency yes it is yeah because out

889
00:38:15,838 --> 00:38:20,239
here at the corners at the edges you

890
00:38:18,318 --> 00:38:22,440
know those leaves those cells there just

891
00:38:20,239 --> 00:38:26,598
haven't developed and so the leaf wants

892
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:29,400
to expand but the tips of the leaflet

893
00:38:26,599 --> 00:38:32,000
are still not developing so the plant

894
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:33,358
try the back part here tries to expand

895
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:36,079
this part doesn't want to go along with

896
00:38:33,358 --> 00:38:39,358
it so you end up with these cups which

897
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:41,160
again symptomatic of low calcium in the

898
00:38:39,358 --> 00:38:43,639
plant doesn't necessarily mean that

899
00:38:41,159 --> 00:38:45,078
there's low calcium in the soil it just

900
00:38:43,639 --> 00:38:47,400
means that it's not getting into the

901
00:38:45,079 --> 00:38:50,760
leaf and getting out to those

902
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:54,280
tips often this is a symptom of this

903
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:56,599
inadequate irrigation or uh off anigan

904
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:58,079
irrigation as opposed to low calcium in

905
00:38:56,599 --> 00:39:00,559
the soil but we'll we'll talk more about

906
00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:00,560
that next

907
00:39:08,159 --> 00:39:13,000
week so uh this is a photograph I won't

908
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:15,200
tell you what it is just yet but it's a

909
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:17,318
real good example of how a nutrient

910
00:39:15,199 --> 00:39:19,519
deficiency develops in the younger

911
00:39:17,318 --> 00:39:22,000
leaves

912
00:39:19,519 --> 00:39:24,159
first these new younger leaves coming

913
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:28,000
out where the older leaves you know

914
00:39:24,159 --> 00:39:31,000
don't show the deficiency

915
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:33,599
and this is iron

916
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:35,800
efficiency and again it's not a very

917
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:37,039
mobile nutrient so it stays in the old

918
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:38,839
leaves they've got theirs they're not

919
00:39:37,039 --> 00:39:40,239
going to share there's new leaves that

920
00:39:38,838 --> 00:39:41,358
come out are wanting some and they're

921
00:39:40,239 --> 00:39:44,519
not going to get it from the older

922
00:39:41,358 --> 00:39:47,598
leaves so they stay yellow very classic

923
00:39:44,519 --> 00:39:50,239
symptoms of iron deficiency is this just

924
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:51,880
general yellowing um yeah it is between

925
00:39:50,239 --> 00:39:55,039
the veins like magnesium but it's a

926
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:56,760
little bit different uh look to it the

927
00:39:55,039 --> 00:40:00,239
veins Stay Green this inter vinal area

928
00:39:56,760 --> 00:40:01,920
is very yellow it's not sort of a red or

929
00:40:00,239 --> 00:40:05,159
a light green it's just

930
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:07,000
yellow which um indicates that it's

931
00:40:05,159 --> 00:40:10,759
probably

932
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:10,760
iron in the youngest

933
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:17,440
Le uh an's asking about uh in Cold

934
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:19,160
Springs blueberries are purple leaves

935
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:21,079
yeah that doesn't indicate a nutrient

936
00:40:19,159 --> 00:40:23,679
deficiency usually that's just cold

937
00:40:21,079 --> 00:40:26,359
temperature and chlorophyll development

938
00:40:23,679 --> 00:40:29,118
usually as soon as the weather warms up

939
00:40:26,358 --> 00:40:31,119
that dark color goes away and leaves

940
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:32,880
appear normal yeah that is often

941
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:34,960
mistaken for phosphorus deficiency when

942
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:36,838
people see that red color in the spring

943
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:39,559
they think oh it's phosphorous

944
00:40:36,838 --> 00:40:42,239
deficiency but it's not it's just plants

945
00:40:39,559 --> 00:40:42,239
just need to warm

946
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:48,760
up close up of iron deficiency fairly

947
00:40:47,199 --> 00:40:52,318
common when blueberries are planted in

948
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:52,319
high pH soils

949
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:09,719
manganese deficiency um we don't see

950
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:11,640
this as much or very much it also uh

951
00:41:09,719 --> 00:41:13,279
appears on younger leaves first it's

952
00:41:11,639 --> 00:41:15,279
very much like iron in terms of its

953
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:17,280
mobility in the plant and here are just

954
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:20,640
some examples of what it might look like

955
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:23,240
on a strawberry Leaf a raspberry

956
00:41:20,639 --> 00:41:27,639
leaf black

957
00:41:23,239 --> 00:41:30,479
current and you can see it's almost like

958
00:41:27,639 --> 00:41:32,759
iron um and in fact you might assume it

959
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:36,559
was iron and again it's these things

960
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:39,440
aren't perfectly um distinctive from one

961
00:41:36,559 --> 00:41:41,318
another so that's why we do you know fer

962
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:42,920
analysis that helps us tell apart what's

963
00:41:41,318 --> 00:41:46,318
going on here you know something's not

964
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:49,639
right but um you can't always tell by

965
00:41:46,318 --> 00:41:52,159
the visual symptoms what it is but we do

966
00:41:49,639 --> 00:41:54,879
see manganese deficiency occasionally

967
00:41:52,159 --> 00:41:57,879
particularly when the soil pH is too

968
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:57,880
high

969
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:03,838
and zinc deficiency I couldn't find a

970
00:42:01,159 --> 00:42:07,078
good photograph of zinc deficiency uh

971
00:42:03,838 --> 00:42:09,358
for Berry crops but it is fairly common

972
00:42:07,079 --> 00:42:12,440
on in tree fruit crops particularly in

973
00:42:09,358 --> 00:42:14,799
sand or soils I see it on apples and

974
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:18,480
citrus particularly Citrus SS grown on

975
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:20,800
Sandy soils um it they also call Little

976
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:23,599
Leaf Disease just because the leaves

977
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:25,760
don't get as big as they need to or

978
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:29,119
should and you also see some inter vinal

979
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:29,119
yellowing which Inc the

980
00:42:31,679 --> 00:42:37,960
efficiency Bon deficiency this is one we

981
00:42:34,639 --> 00:42:39,920
do see quite a bit in the Northeast uh

982
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:42,480
availability of boron is quite variable

983
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:44,880
in our soils and we run into situations

984
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:47,639
where it can be low in fact it's one of

985
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:51,760
the one of the only micronutrients that

986
00:42:47,639 --> 00:42:54,960
we um test for particularly in

987
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:56,119
strawberries because oh get SC my phone

988
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:59,199
off

989
00:42:56,119 --> 00:43:01,160
here Pickering strawberries because uh

990
00:42:59,199 --> 00:43:03,838
it can be low and it's an important

991
00:43:01,159 --> 00:43:06,318
nutrient for plant growth so this is

992
00:43:03,838 --> 00:43:09,279
blueberry though and this is a big

993
00:43:06,318 --> 00:43:12,358
grower in Maine who had a bunch of low

994
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:14,200
Bush blueberries and he kept telling me

995
00:43:12,358 --> 00:43:16,639
he always had winter injury in his

996
00:43:14,199 --> 00:43:18,558
plants and uh indeed it does look like

997
00:43:16,639 --> 00:43:20,279
winter injury and after a particularly

998
00:43:18,559 --> 00:43:21,640
mild winter he called up and he said I

999
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:23,319
still have winter injury I can't believe

1000
00:43:21,639 --> 00:43:26,239
it we had good snow cover it wasn't that

1001
00:43:23,318 --> 00:43:29,279
cold we did a leaf analysis Boron was

1002
00:43:26,239 --> 00:43:30,799
really low we applied Boron over his

1003
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:33,960
Fields the next year no problem

1004
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:36,119
whatsoever so this dback is very

1005
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:39,358
characteristic of boron you see this

1006
00:43:36,119 --> 00:43:42,240
dieback here I'll tell you why in a

1007
00:43:39,358 --> 00:43:44,159
minute this is a root system of a

1008
00:43:42,239 --> 00:43:46,399
strawberry plant that has all the

1009
00:43:44,159 --> 00:43:48,838
nutrients it needs it was grown in a

1010
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:52,800
water solution hence the proliferation

1011
00:43:48,838 --> 00:43:54,679
of roots but um the next picture I'm

1012
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:58,359
going to show you is the root system

1013
00:43:54,679 --> 00:43:58,358
growing without boron

1014
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:03,358
everything else is there but you can see

1015
00:44:00,159 --> 00:44:06,399
that root tips are really stubby and

1016
00:44:03,358 --> 00:44:10,558
that's because Boron is responsible

1017
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:13,079
for uh oxin production which stimulates

1018
00:44:10,559 --> 00:44:15,160
U root growth and cell elongation you

1019
00:44:13,079 --> 00:44:17,318
don't have Boron you don't have good

1020
00:44:15,159 --> 00:44:19,519
oxin activity therefore you don't have

1021
00:44:17,318 --> 00:44:22,480
good cell expansion so you get these

1022
00:44:19,519 --> 00:44:25,199
stubby little root tips and of course

1023
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:29,039
Roots like this don't do a very good job

1024
00:44:25,199 --> 00:44:29,039
of taking up other nutrients either

1025
00:44:31,039 --> 00:44:35,679
another characteristic of boron

1026
00:44:32,519 --> 00:44:39,480
deficiency is asymmetrical leaves so

1027
00:44:35,679 --> 00:44:41,679
like on this Leaf over here you see U

1028
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:43,480
the leaflet tends to be smaller than

1029
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:46,279
normal anyway but you often see this as

1030
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:47,838
symmetry whereas in normal leaves with

1031
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:49,599
adequate nutrition you don't get that as

1032
00:44:47,838 --> 00:44:51,358
Symmetry and then this is a real severe

1033
00:44:49,599 --> 00:44:54,760
case where the leaves just fell to

1034
00:44:51,358 --> 00:44:56,400
develop again we don't have the cell

1035
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:58,200
elongation that we would normally get

1036
00:44:56,400 --> 00:45:00,400
when there's enough oxygen present in

1037
00:44:58,199 --> 00:45:00,399
the

1038
00:45:00,679 --> 00:45:10,639
plant and on the strawberry fruit

1039
00:45:04,719 --> 00:45:13,318
itself the little Ain here excrete oxin

1040
00:45:10,639 --> 00:45:16,358
which cause the receptical tissue

1041
00:45:13,318 --> 00:45:18,318
underneath to expand that's why the

1042
00:45:16,358 --> 00:45:20,279
strawberry plant or strawberry fruit

1043
00:45:18,318 --> 00:45:23,000
grows and turns into a strawberry when

1044
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:26,000
these little Ain aren't producing

1045
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:28,039
oxin you don't get that expansion and so

1046
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:31,440
the fruit becomes deformed

1047
00:45:28,039 --> 00:45:35,239
so anything that impacts these little

1048
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:38,079
Ain whether it be frost which kills the

1049
00:45:35,239 --> 00:45:41,759
aen a growing embryo or tarnish plant

1050
00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:44,640
bug feeding or low Boron are going to

1051
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:47,119
give you these deform fruit again if you

1052
00:45:44,639 --> 00:45:49,838
just saw this you wouldn't really know

1053
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:52,838
which of those three it was but when you

1054
00:45:49,838 --> 00:45:55,358
do a or Poe pollination or something but

1055
00:45:52,838 --> 00:45:56,679
or maybe those four things but a leaf

1056
00:45:55,358 --> 00:46:00,078
analysis could tell you whether it might

1057
00:45:56,679 --> 00:46:00,078
be one at least you could Ru it

1058
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:11,000
out so uh I have don't have any more

1059
00:46:08,719 --> 00:46:14,039
toxicity pictures to show you deficiency

1060
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:17,719
symptoms but I do have a a warning for

1061
00:46:14,039 --> 00:46:20,159
you not to be fooled because herbicide

1062
00:46:17,719 --> 00:46:21,879
toxicity symptoms often resemble

1063
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:25,239
nutrient deficiency

1064
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:27,720
symptoms so here I have a a picture of

1065
00:46:25,239 --> 00:46:30,519
of some plants that um have been

1066
00:46:27,719 --> 00:46:34,519
affected by herbicide in this case

1067
00:46:30,519 --> 00:46:36,639
Roundup in this case simine in this case

1068
00:46:34,519 --> 00:46:39,759
sybar in this case

1069
00:46:36,639 --> 00:46:43,199
solicam uh this picture here is actually

1070
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:45,359
June yellows it's a

1071
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:47,919
phytoplasmas of strawberries that causes

1072
00:46:45,358 --> 00:46:49,960
them to turn yellow but what I wanted to

1073
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:52,119
do is just show you that just because

1074
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:53,519
you see that yellowing don't

1075
00:46:52,119 --> 00:46:56,119
automatically assume that it's a

1076
00:46:53,519 --> 00:46:57,639
nutrient deficiency it could be but

1077
00:46:56,119 --> 00:47:01,599
check on the

1078
00:46:57,639 --> 00:47:04,838
history of the herbicide use uh it's

1079
00:47:01,599 --> 00:47:04,838
also possible there might be this

1080
00:47:06,639 --> 00:47:11,400
phytoplasmas side injury usually occurs

1081
00:47:08,719 --> 00:47:13,358
in a regular pattern in a field I see it

1082
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:14,838
often at the end of rows where the

1083
00:47:13,358 --> 00:47:17,078
tractor that's spraying the herbicide

1084
00:47:14,838 --> 00:47:18,400
slows down to make a turn and then you

1085
00:47:17,079 --> 00:47:20,000
get a little bit more herbicide than you

1086
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:23,280
want it at the end of the row for

1087
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:26,599
example every third row where the spray

1088
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:27,760
might overlap with the with the pass and

1089
00:47:26,599 --> 00:47:29,480
so

1090
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:32,640
where that overlap is you get some

1091
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:35,519
injury symptoms I've seen herbicide

1092
00:47:32,639 --> 00:47:37,358
damaged near wet areas took me while to

1093
00:47:35,519 --> 00:47:39,079
figure out what was going on but what

1094
00:47:37,358 --> 00:47:41,000
was going on that they were spraying the

1095
00:47:39,079 --> 00:47:43,039
herbicide when it was wet when the

1096
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:44,960
tractor got into that wetter area the

1097
00:47:43,039 --> 00:47:47,039
wheels started to spin a little bit the

1098
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:48,800
tractor slowed down but the rate

1099
00:47:47,039 --> 00:47:52,039
herbicide coming out the sprayer was the

1100
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:53,839
same so always right to the side of

1101
00:47:52,039 --> 00:47:55,639
these wet spots you see these herbicide

1102
00:47:53,838 --> 00:47:58,039
deficiencies or these herbicide injury

1103
00:47:55,639 --> 00:48:00,358
symptoms but uh that was from that

1104
00:47:58,039 --> 00:48:02,639
sprayer so you look for patterns with

1105
00:48:00,358 --> 00:48:04,159
herbicide um usually the herbicide

1106
00:48:02,639 --> 00:48:06,639
injury has a rapid onset whereas the

1107
00:48:04,159 --> 00:48:09,598
nutrient deficiencies usually develop

1108
00:48:06,639 --> 00:48:11,679
more slowly and often follow the soil

1109
00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:13,400
type so my point is don't just

1110
00:48:11,679 --> 00:48:15,399
automatically assume it's a nutrient

1111
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:17,838
deficiency even though it looks like

1112
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:20,318
those pictures I just showed

1113
00:48:17,838 --> 00:48:22,318
you and lastly I wanted to point out

1114
00:48:20,318 --> 00:48:25,558
that over fertilization can result in

1115
00:48:22,318 --> 00:48:27,239
injury symptoms as well here's uh here

1116
00:48:25,559 --> 00:48:29,280
are some photographs of some strawberry

1117
00:48:27,239 --> 00:48:32,719
plants that have been over fertilized

1118
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:36,240
with certain nutrients so uh in this

1119
00:48:32,719 --> 00:48:39,039
Photograph here uh too much

1120
00:48:36,239 --> 00:48:40,838
ammonium nitrogen fertilizer the same

1121
00:48:39,039 --> 00:48:43,920
way with this Photograph

1122
00:48:40,838 --> 00:48:46,119
here down here we have too much

1123
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:49,079
Boron and again you get symptoms almost

1124
00:48:46,119 --> 00:48:51,358
look like pottassium uh deficiency but

1125
00:48:49,079 --> 00:48:54,318
actually in this case here it's too much

1126
00:48:51,358 --> 00:48:56,798
Boron over here too much zinc again

1127
00:48:54,318 --> 00:48:58,318
looks like it's a deficiency but really

1128
00:48:56,798 --> 00:49:02,280
if you overdo it you can have the same

1129
00:48:58,318 --> 00:49:05,920
problem as well and up here some of this

1130
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:08,440
chosis U that might look like you know

1131
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:11,599
phosphorus deficiency is actually too

1132
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:14,000
much copper so um you got to be really

1133
00:49:11,599 --> 00:49:15,640
careful just using visual assessment as

1134
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:19,400
to what's going

1135
00:49:15,639 --> 00:49:21,318
on so my take-home message is that

1136
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:23,760
visual symptoms of nutrient deficiencies

1137
00:49:21,318 --> 00:49:27,558
are difficult to diagnose and can be

1138
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:28,839
confused with many other things

1139
00:49:27,559 --> 00:49:31,280
one should try to address these

1140
00:49:28,838 --> 00:49:32,798
nutritional problems before visual

1141
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:34,920
symptoms occur because once you start to

1142
00:49:32,798 --> 00:49:36,679
see the visual symptoms you know darn

1143
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:38,838
well that yield has been affected and

1144
00:49:36,679 --> 00:49:42,039
plant growth has been

1145
00:49:38,838 --> 00:49:43,759
affected and lastly a fuller Elemental

1146
00:49:42,039 --> 00:49:46,159
analysis of the best technology we

1147
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:48,680
currently have for assessing plant

1148
00:49:46,159 --> 00:49:48,679
nutrient

1149
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:54,838
status so at the next webinar we're

1150
00:49:53,199 --> 00:49:57,558
going to be actually looking at some of

1151
00:49:54,838 --> 00:50:00,199
the numbers that come off of the foler

1152
00:49:57,559 --> 00:50:02,640
tests and uh seeing if we can interpret

1153
00:50:00,199 --> 00:50:04,399
them and uh hopefully with the

1154
00:50:02,639 --> 00:50:05,960
understanding you've gotten today with

1155
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:07,760
how these nutrients move in a plant how

1156
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:09,199
they interact you would better able to

1157
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:11,960
interpret these foler tests that we're

1158
00:50:09,199 --> 00:50:15,798
going to look at in a couple of

1159
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:17,480
weeks so this is the end of my formal uh

1160
00:50:15,798 --> 00:50:19,599
remarks and presentations if people want

1161
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:21,280
to type in some questions we still have

1162
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:25,119
a few minutes

1163
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:25,119
to and come up with some

1164
00:50:25,639 --> 00:50:29,679
answers e

1165
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:10,358
doesn't look like anyone's typing so I

1166
00:51:08,079 --> 00:51:11,559
assume that means people are

1167
00:51:10,358 --> 00:51:14,679
understanding it and they're comfortable

1168
00:51:11,559 --> 00:51:17,119
with material so uh Dan are you still

1169
00:51:14,679 --> 00:51:19,440
out there you can maybe come on and say

1170
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:19,440
a few

1171
00:51:19,798 --> 00:51:26,599
words yeah um oh we do have one question

1172
00:51:23,599 --> 00:51:26,599
there

1173
00:51:28,159 --> 00:51:32,358
okay the question is does excess zinc

1174
00:51:30,719 --> 00:51:34,798
look like iron deficiency because the

1175
00:51:32,358 --> 00:51:36,920
zinc is interfering with iron uptake or

1176
00:51:34,798 --> 00:51:38,079
is it just coincidence that's a good

1177
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:39,960
question I don't know the answer to that

1178
00:51:38,079 --> 00:51:42,680
I'll just admit it's certainly possible

1179
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:44,240
that since they're both dant catons that

1180
00:51:42,679 --> 00:51:46,919
zinc and iron could be interfering with

1181
00:51:44,239 --> 00:51:49,199
each other it's not one of those common

1182
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:52,519
antagonisms that have been written about

1183
00:51:49,199 --> 00:51:55,199
or studied but I imagine that's a

1184
00:51:52,519 --> 00:51:58,239
possibility we have uh someone else

1185
00:51:55,199 --> 00:52:01,358
typing here as well

1186
00:51:58,239 --> 00:52:03,078
these these interactions in Plants you

1187
00:52:01,358 --> 00:52:04,960
know are not that well studied

1188
00:52:03,079 --> 00:52:08,680
particularly in Berry crops very few

1189
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:11,440
people have looked at it um so there's a

1190
00:52:08,679 --> 00:52:13,039
lot of unanswered questions out there uh

1191
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:14,318
when's the best time in which leaves

1192
00:52:13,039 --> 00:52:17,358
should be taken for strawberry tissue

1193
00:52:14,318 --> 00:52:19,000
analysis so I mentioned earlier uh right

1194
00:52:17,358 --> 00:52:22,358
after renovation when those new leaves

1195
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:25,960
come up out of the ground uh after

1196
00:52:22,358 --> 00:52:27,400
harvest that's usually Late July maybe

1197
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:30,199
early August that's the best time for

1198
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:30,200
strawberry tissue

1199
00:52:36,119 --> 00:52:44,280
analysis okay it doesn't look like

1200
00:52:38,679 --> 00:52:47,879
there's uh any other questions um just a

1201
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:51,119
couple of quick reminders um so our next
