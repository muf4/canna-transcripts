2
00:00:11,119 --> 00:00:16,358
so first why breed cover crops uh when

3
00:00:14,679 --> 00:00:17,920
we when the cover crop breeding Network

4
00:00:16,359 --> 00:00:21,600
first started doing its work back in

5
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:24,359
2015 2016 we carried out a survey of a

6
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,480
little over 400 farmers and asked which

7
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:28,880
traits they felt were important for each

8
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,640
of the crops we planned on working on so

9
00:00:28,879 --> 00:00:32,920
over winter cover crops

10
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:35,239
so the most commonly mentioned trait was

11
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:37,320
nitrogen fixation which we've

12
00:00:35,238 --> 00:00:41,000
investigated and found correlates quite

13
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:44,640
highly with uh biomass accumulation so

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:47,238
biomass is a goal in and of itself

15
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:49,600
um because in combination with early

16
00:00:47,238 --> 00:00:51,679
Vigor it helps with lead competition and

17
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:54,239
all those soil soil health benefits that

18
00:00:51,679 --> 00:00:57,719
come from having a a big mass of biomass

19
00:00:54,238 --> 00:01:00,000
to decompose um winter hardiness is a

20
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:02,079
big goal um obviously because the

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:07,478
without that we don't get any of those

22
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:10,560
um those benefits of uh biomass in the

23
00:01:07,478 --> 00:01:12,079
spring and we didn't ask on this survey

24
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,960
but we also know that breeding for a

25
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:16,879
seed yield uh can help bring seed costs

26
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:20,158
down and and make cover cropping a

27
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:22,599
reasonable economic Pro proposition for

28
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:24,799
Farmers so in all of our crops we're

29
00:01:22,599 --> 00:01:27,478
breeding for biomass bigger Winter

30
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:29,280
survival we also have some crop specific

31
00:01:27,478 --> 00:01:32,118
goals and we'll talk specifically about

32
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:35,200
cold tolerance and winter PE today for

33
00:01:32,118 --> 00:01:37,000
the three legumes and Rye we start with

34
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:40,399
um breeding nurseries like these where

35
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,680
we can note and select single plants so

36
00:01:40,399 --> 00:01:45,640
crimson clover hary vet and Rye are

37
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:48,920
outcrossing species so nurseries start

38
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:51,399
with 1,00 to 1500 plants we select 5 or

39
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:54,040
10% of those and all the plants left in

40
00:01:51,399 --> 00:01:56,079
the nursery share pollen with one

41
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:58,320
another and we end up with one

42
00:01:56,078 --> 00:02:01,839
population coming out of that

43
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:01,839
Nursery in cont

44
00:02:03,118 --> 00:02:07,959
uh wintery is a selfin crop which means

45
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:10,399
it doesn't naturally share pollen with

46
00:02:07,959 --> 00:02:13,519
its neighbors so to create genetic

47
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:15,800
diversity we have to cross uh the pollen

48
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:20,719
from one plant to the

49
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:22,800
stigma right here the sticky stigma or

50
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:25,719
the the female reproductive part of

51
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:28,319
another plant um so we start with

52
00:02:25,719 --> 00:02:31,878
segregating populations from this two

53
00:02:28,318 --> 00:02:34,399
plant cross and then select uh usually

54
00:02:31,878 --> 00:02:36,799
individuals to increase and advance to

55
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,800
the Next

56
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:44,480
Generation so for these crops once we

57
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:46,479
select good-looking things in nurseries

58
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:50,158
the next step is Advanced line trials in

59
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:52,518
multiple locations nationwide so these

60
00:02:50,158 --> 00:02:54,598
uh plots look a lot like the ones that

61
00:02:52,519 --> 00:02:58,280
you have on your farm right so there's a

62
00:02:54,598 --> 00:03:01,280
15 foot row of the focus crop in our

63
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:04,360
case winter peas blanked by trale and we

64
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:07,598
do this to simulate the competition that

65
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:10,400
um the legging would have in a in a mix

66
00:03:07,598 --> 00:03:12,318
that legum grass mix is commonly used

67
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:15,239
and we know that survival is generally

68
00:03:12,318 --> 00:03:18,439
better um with

69
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:21,560
um with the protection and uh snow

70
00:03:18,439 --> 00:03:25,280
holding ability of uh of the

71
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:27,680
grass so for the for the legumes in the

72
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:29,519
cover cut breeding Network we have about

73
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,438
six years of data which has allowed us

74
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:35,959
to make some pretty robust conclusions

75
00:03:31,438 --> 00:03:39,000
about how these lines do over space and

76
00:03:35,959 --> 00:03:41,479
time this year we're adding uh National

77
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,158
cover C variety trials which are plot

78
00:03:41,479 --> 00:03:48,639
sized so these are uh four and a half

79
00:03:44,158 --> 00:03:52,840
foot wide plots by 20 feet um with five

80
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:55,039
varieties per species replicated um

81
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:57,239
across 12 sites these are the iterations

82
00:03:55,039 --> 00:04:02,959
we have at preville New York our

83
00:03:57,239 --> 00:04:08,200
research Farm here um and this allows um

84
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:11,199
a next size larger plot to um to compare

85
00:04:08,199 --> 00:04:13,839
the best of the best across uh time and

86
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:16,959
place so to sum up there are two sides

87
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:18,840
of our breeding process we've got uh

88
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:20,798
germ plasm sourcing germ plasm

89
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:23,519
development then selection and breeding

90
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:26,039
nurseries then Advanced line trials the

91
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:29,478
15ot rows that we run in uh several

92
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:31,439
locations across the country then these

93
00:04:29,478 --> 00:04:34,319
uh larger

94
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:36,639
plots concurrently we have seed yield

95
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:38,879
trials on smaller plots and then larger

96
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:41,840
plots so that we can make sure that we

97
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:43,719
weed out lines with poor seed yield or

98
00:04:41,839 --> 00:04:46,359
put more focus on lines with really

99
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:48,039
promising seed yield and then finally we

100
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:50,560
get to release and

101
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:52,879
commercialization you all come in right

102
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,879
over here so the On Prom trials are

103
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:57,360
meant to supplement the knowledge we are

104
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:59,038
gting from our V fine trials which

105
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,400
because even if they're in a dozen

106
00:04:59,038 --> 00:05:05,918
locations across the country that's only

107
00:05:01,399 --> 00:05:07,839
a dozen and you guys are 69 locations so

108
00:05:05,918 --> 00:05:10,279
that's a huge advantage to be able to

109
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:12,519
you look at a trait like winter survival

110
00:05:10,279 --> 00:05:15,879
which ultimately is a yes or no there's

111
00:05:12,519 --> 00:05:21,959
a lot of nuance in there but it gives us

112
00:05:15,879 --> 00:05:25,199
a lot more um nuanced perspective on uh

113
00:05:21,959 --> 00:05:25,198
where and how these things

114
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:34,720
survive so our original goal and still

115
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:37,918
our goal with these trials is to have

116
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:40,319
you all trial cover proper Network

117
00:05:37,918 --> 00:05:43,198
experimental material we had some issues

118
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:45,840
with seed availability up until now so

119
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:49,439
we started this year with uh commercial

120
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:51,478
material um to get our methods down Etc

121
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:55,560
but starting this fall we should be able

122
00:05:51,478 --> 00:05:57,038
to let you trial some um CCV material um

123
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:58,519
and I guess the good part is that if you

124
00:05:57,038 --> 00:06:00,959
find something you really like out of

125
00:05:58,519 --> 00:06:02,240
what you have um you can go buy it for

126
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:08,638
your

127
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:12,560
farm so um this is an analysis based on

128
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:15,400
six years of uh Advanced line trial data

129
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:17,000
so you see the number of times each

130
00:06:15,399 --> 00:06:20,000
thing was trialed right here in the

131
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,360
observations column so we've got quite a

132
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,319
bit of data so you know 25 different

133
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:28,080
environments for this first um first

134
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:30,919
entry here

135
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:34,198
um we compare everything to the best

136
00:06:30,918 --> 00:06:36,959
check in um in our trials which for us

137
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:39,240
is W winter for the balance of traits

138
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:42,159
that we think are uh beneficial for

139
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:44,079
cover cropping so we see quite a bit of

140
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:46,120
progress for fall Vigor and spring Vigor

141
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:47,839
and biomass so there're a lot of things

142
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:51,478
that are better that are as good or

143
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:55,038
better for those three traits not a ton

144
00:06:51,478 --> 00:06:57,560
of progress in um in Winter survival

145
00:06:55,038 --> 00:07:01,159
although we're we have comparable Winter

146
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:05,879
survival to the best um to W

147
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:10,840
winter let's see um this is an index

148
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:13,160
that I make to be able to balance um to

149
00:07:10,839 --> 00:07:16,560
to waight the traits that are most

150
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:18,840
important um I can say more about that

151
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,839
if it's

152
00:07:20,439 --> 00:07:27,839
helpful one last thing to say is that a

153
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:29,199
couple of these with the Stars um are

154
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:30,119
we're hoping to make available for

155
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:33,120
release

156
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:34,759
the top one um this was selected on Mark

157
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,800
dudas Farm who was on the call with us

158
00:07:34,759 --> 00:07:38,919
today so Mark I would love to talk you

159
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,560
more if you're able to hang on um about

160
00:07:38,918 --> 00:07:42,439
some details about that because it's

161
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,680
really shown excellent performance

162
00:07:42,439 --> 00:07:46,800
across time and space so that's exciting

163
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:49,000
to see that there there is progress to

164
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,000
be

165
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:55,598
made um these are the lines the three of

166
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:58,038
the four lines you have in your trial so

167
00:07:55,598 --> 00:08:00,240
w winter is our best check it's been

168
00:07:58,038 --> 00:08:03,199
trialed in five seasons we got a lot of

169
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:06,360
data on it uh survivors also look really

170
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:08,520
nice um it's a little more compact of a

171
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:10,319
plant it's a little later to flower but

172
00:08:08,519 --> 00:08:13,598
it's done really nicely we only have two

173
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:15,319
years of data so far so um we know it's

174
00:08:13,598 --> 00:08:18,399
a it's a good-look pretty reliable

175
00:08:15,319 --> 00:08:20,879
variety so we put that in there Blaze

176
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:23,799
some of you have is a semi-leafless

177
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:25,879
variety um it doesn't put on as much

178
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:28,199
biomass because the type of PE it is

179
00:08:25,879 --> 00:08:30,080
we'll talk more about that um but it has

180
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:34,399
great Winter survival we kind of put

181
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:37,038
that in there for uh can can

182
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:38,918
um if if there are places that Blaze

183
00:08:37,038 --> 00:08:41,199
survives that the others don't we know

184
00:08:38,918 --> 00:08:44,759
that those are really key places to

185
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:47,240
Target for uh studying and selecting for

186
00:08:44,759 --> 00:08:47,240
which are Sur

187
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:53,480
upful so this is where you come in um

188
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:56,480
your plots are small scale plots to hope

189
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:59,320
to I think we have accommodated a lot of

190
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:01,680
um I guess this is good for home gardens

191
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:04,720
um um for veg farmers who are growing on

192
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:07,679
beds already things like that um you

193
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:09,519
have 69 participants 43 of you have

194
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:10,879
submitted results which is honestly a

195
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:12,959
pretty good ratio about what we were

196
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:15,480
hoping for it will give us a really

197
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:17,518
great Baseline of data we obviously are

198
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:20,278
using the seed link platform where you

199
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:21,839
are collecting data on an app like this

200
00:09:20,278 --> 00:09:24,200
and we have interactive results like

201
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:27,519
this which I'll share with you

202
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:31,360
today um we've taken data once in the

203
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:31,360
fall we'll take it twice in the spring

204
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:37,240
um and we have a rubric to make sure

205
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:41,439
that each of us are um

206
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:45,278
generally um having each number of the

207
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:45,279
rating scale mean approximately the same

208
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:53,599
thing these are photos from Reeds Farm

209
00:09:49,039 --> 00:09:57,919
um mapping the trial out planting it and

210
00:09:53,600 --> 00:10:01,720
um having the seed in the ground so

211
00:09:57,919 --> 00:10:04,879
um this is what you all found for

212
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:07,360
germination and emergence um germination

213
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:08,679
I guess the trade is called germination

214
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,440
in seedlink we're really measuring

215
00:10:08,679 --> 00:10:15,078
emergence we're measuring what we can

216
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:18,440
see coming out of the soil um we had 28

217
00:10:15,078 --> 00:10:20,479
to 34 reviewers per variety and

218
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:25,279
everything was in the the three to five

219
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:27,879
range so um generally better than 75%

220
00:10:25,278 --> 00:10:30,320
emergence which is which is pretty good

221
00:10:27,879 --> 00:10:33,759
um Blaze did a little a little more

222
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:37,519
poorly which is interesting um all of

223
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:41,559
the lines tested at 93% germ or above uh

224
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:41,560
before we sent them out

225
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:49,399
um for fall Viger uh same general

226
00:10:46,278 --> 00:10:52,838
Trends so everything was everything was

227
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:55,519
at least acceptable at a three um with

228
00:10:52,839 --> 00:10:56,880
canid went Survivor moving towards

229
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:59,360
strong

230
00:10:56,879 --> 00:11:02,919
growth and part of this difference

231
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:04,959
noticing owes to the the leaf type so

232
00:11:02,919 --> 00:11:07,958
there is a gene there there are three

233
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:12,359
genes in P that control leaf leaf and

234
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:15,119
tendril distribution and shape

235
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:17,879
um varieties like Blaze that are semi

236
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:21,679
leafless have two recessive copies of

237
00:11:17,879 --> 00:11:23,759
the Aila Gene um so they will put on

238
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:27,000
tendrils where their terminal leaves

239
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:30,120
would otherwise be for grain production

240
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:34,039
this type is really beneficial so the

241
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:36,200
uh these types uh stand up kind of hold

242
00:11:34,039 --> 00:11:40,000
hands and they are much easier to

243
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:44,600
harvest they don't Lodge as much

244
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:47,759
um so most of the grain peas uh produced

245
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:49,440
now are these semile leafless types um

246
00:11:47,759 --> 00:11:51,240
and like I said we put blaze in because

247
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:53,040
of its exceptional winter hardiness not

248
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:55,240
necessarily because of its biomass but

249
00:11:53,039 --> 00:11:57,759
I'm also really curious if any of you

250
00:11:55,240 --> 00:12:00,039
like that type better for manageability

251
00:11:57,759 --> 00:12:02,799
reasons or anything else

252
00:12:00,039 --> 00:12:05,639
um and the other three varieties are

253
00:12:02,799 --> 00:12:07,879
normal leafy types so they are more

254
00:12:05,639 --> 00:12:09,639
indeterminate and Vining and they're the

255
00:12:07,879 --> 00:12:11,278
the're the pee plants you might be more

256
00:12:09,639 --> 00:12:13,759
used

257
00:12:11,278 --> 00:12:16,159
to um let's see I see a few things in

258
00:12:13,759 --> 00:12:20,519
the chat let me just check

259
00:12:16,159 --> 00:12:20,519
that oh hello Glenn good to see

260
00:12:21,759 --> 00:12:26,838
you okay the next thing we asked you to

261
00:12:25,159 --> 00:12:31,039
rate

262
00:12:26,839 --> 00:12:33,600
um was flavor so we um coordinated with

263
00:12:31,039 --> 00:12:38,078
our friends at Blue Hill at Stone Barnes

264
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:39,560
to think about um tasting uh peas since

265
00:12:38,078 --> 00:12:42,239
peas are unique and that they can be

266
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:46,278
both a functional cover crop and H a

267
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:49,278
tasty uh peas shot or greens Pig greens

268
00:12:46,278 --> 00:12:49,278
crop

269
00:12:49,958 --> 00:12:54,518
um we we'll chat afterwards about how

270
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:57,039
many of you evaluated flavor fewer

271
00:12:54,519 --> 00:13:01,399
people did

272
00:12:57,039 --> 00:13:04,919
um like 15 to reviews uh per variety we

273
00:13:01,399 --> 00:13:07,000
got for flavor and generally we got in

274
00:13:04,919 --> 00:13:09,120
the range of I'd eat it again but I

275
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,958
wouldn't seek it out to happily eat

276
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:16,600
again for Survivor when you look at the

277
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:18,399
comments that some of you left um it's

278
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:20,920
really all over the board so there are a

279
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:24,000
lot of environmental factors that can

280
00:13:20,919 --> 00:13:27,479
influence how um or what what flavor

281
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:32,360
compounds come out in in pee or in any

282
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:34,360
uh crop so for Survivor um across space

283
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:37,278
this fall we got everything from very

284
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:40,879
bitter overpowers any sweetness to

285
00:13:37,278 --> 00:13:43,078
really good green pea flavor um to very

286
00:13:40,879 --> 00:13:47,000
sweet very

287
00:13:43,078 --> 00:13:48,399
pleasurable get a similar assortment of

288
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,399
ratings for

289
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:51,399
texture

290
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:57,720
um and yeah that's just I think one of

291
00:13:55,519 --> 00:14:00,959
the one of my favorite things about

292
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:03,040
studying flavor is that everyone's right

293
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:06,319
like there's no objectively good or bad

294
00:14:03,039 --> 00:14:09,159
flavor um different ones of us have

295
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:10,959
different assortments of taste buds we

296
00:14:09,159 --> 00:14:13,838
also have different experiences

297
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:16,599
associated with Foods so the very same

298
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:19,959
food can uh

299
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:22,199
legitimately taste or have a um an

300
00:14:19,958 --> 00:14:24,159
overall experience more positive or

301
00:14:22,198 --> 00:14:25,519
negative um even if it's grown in the

302
00:14:24,159 --> 00:14:27,360
same place then you throw in the

303
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:29,879
variables of where is it grown how much

304
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:33,800
moisture has it had how much uh heat as

305
00:14:29,879 --> 00:14:35,078
it had all these things um and yeah the

306
00:14:33,799 --> 00:14:37,359
same variety can taste a lot of

307
00:14:35,078 --> 00:14:40,439
different ways but it is interesting to

308
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:42,079
see if we can find

309
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:44,560
Trends

310
00:14:42,078 --> 00:14:46,120
so what are we talking about when we

311
00:14:44,559 --> 00:14:50,439
talk about winter

312
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:53,320
hardiness um when in our uh Advanced

313
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:55,600
line trials we talk about um Winter

314
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:58,278
survival is just a ratio of the spring

315
00:14:55,600 --> 00:15:01,360
stand to the fall stand so what percent

316
00:14:58,278 --> 00:15:04,879
of what came up in the fall was there in

317
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:08,399
the spring um it's a bit of a blunt

318
00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:11,480
instrument but it's it's pretty relevant

319
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:15,879
and it it lets us um it certainly lets

320
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:21,079
us differentiate among varieties

321
00:15:15,879 --> 00:15:25,639
um as all of you know um let me

322
00:15:21,078 --> 00:15:27,479
see oh nice thanks re for the props

323
00:15:25,639 --> 00:15:30,680
too

324
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:34,278
um winter complex right so it's not just

325
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:39,679
temperature it's also snow cover wind

326
00:15:34,278 --> 00:15:42,439
soil moisture and then the uh rate of

327
00:15:39,679 --> 00:15:45,479
change between different temperatures

328
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:49,240
and um snow cover and no snow cover and

329
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:51,399
certainly ice um so it's it's it's more

330
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:54,240
than just cold temperature but when we

331
00:15:51,399 --> 00:15:57,399
talk about temperature specifically um

332
00:15:54,240 --> 00:16:00,240
acclamation is the process of um the

333
00:15:57,399 --> 00:16:02,600
plant's biochemical adaptation to cold

334
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:06,278
temperatures and then de acclamation is

335
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:09,720
the reversal of that process so when

336
00:16:06,278 --> 00:16:13,639
we're thinking about things that we want

337
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:16,360
to uh keep some cold hardiness when we

338
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:17,959
have more temperature fluctuations gets

339
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:20,480
really cold but then we have some warm

340
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:23,479
days and it gets really cold again uh so

341
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:25,600
that's something that we are hoping to

342
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:32,039
be able to select for just by selecting

343
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:32,040
in um the conditions of a change in

344
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:39,279
climate what makes a PE witer hearty so

345
00:16:35,639 --> 00:16:41,919
there's a gene called the HR Gene that

346
00:16:39,278 --> 00:16:45,679
confers high sensitivity to day length

347
00:16:41,919 --> 00:16:49,198
so the P stays in its vegetative stage

348
00:16:45,679 --> 00:16:52,359
where it's putting on uh leafy biomass

349
00:16:49,198 --> 00:16:54,159
but not putting on flowers yet and in

350
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:57,839
the vegetative stage it is less

351
00:16:54,159 --> 00:17:01,078
sensitive to Coal so by delaying

352
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:04,558
flowering until those longer days in the

353
00:17:01,078 --> 00:17:07,159
spring um that gives it a a critical

354
00:17:04,558 --> 00:17:11,838
mass of

355
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:11,839
uh of um cold

356
00:17:12,318 --> 00:17:18,159
hardiness cold hearty peas also have a

357
00:17:15,759 --> 00:17:20,838
higher photosynthetic rate and they

358
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:24,679
accumulate more sugars which you can

359
00:17:20,838 --> 00:17:27,678
taste um so it's finding peas with first

360
00:17:24,679 --> 00:17:31,880
of all that capacity to have that higher

361
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:34,640
photosynthetic rate to make more sugars

362
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:37,080
um and then to have those functions

363
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:39,480
upregulated when the temperatures drop

364
00:17:37,079 --> 00:17:41,839
so there's variation in those things

365
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:44,279
like do we have the capacity genetically

366
00:17:41,839 --> 00:17:47,199
and then does that capacity get dialed

367
00:17:44,279 --> 00:17:48,798
up uh at the right rate when

368
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:53,400
temperatures get

369
00:17:48,798 --> 00:17:55,839
cold those um going back to probably

370
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:58,880
high school chemistry that we did um

371
00:17:55,839 --> 00:18:00,918
when we put solutes in water it will

372
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:02,600
will uh raise the boiling point and

373
00:18:00,919 --> 00:18:04,038
lower the freezing point and it's

374
00:18:02,599 --> 00:18:07,719
lowering that freezing point that we're

375
00:18:04,038 --> 00:18:12,200
interested in here um and preventing the

376
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:15,240
cell tissues from drying out from the

377
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:19,400
um from from losing that

378
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:23,359
uh osmotic balance between different uh

379
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:26,200
parts of the cell increases more anti or

380
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:29,519
um more antioxidants are produced cell

381
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:31,960
wall uh uh

382
00:18:29,519 --> 00:18:34,240
composition is changed slightly it's a

383
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:36,079
lot of detail it's pretty complex but

384
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:38,640
that's in general what's

385
00:18:36,079 --> 00:18:40,519
happening we know from our advanc line

386
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:44,520
trials that there's kind of this sweet

387
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:47,440
spot where we have

388
00:18:44,519 --> 00:18:49,279
um we don't have complete winter death

389
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:51,240
we don't have complete Winter survival

390
00:18:49,279 --> 00:18:54,079
because neither of those scenarios tell

391
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:55,880
us much or are much good for selection

392
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:57,839
because we can't tell which varieties

393
00:18:55,880 --> 00:19:00,600
are any worse or better than others so

394
00:18:57,839 --> 00:19:02,879
that's where we ically placed uh on Farm

395
00:19:00,599 --> 00:19:05,240
nurseries like the one at Mark's Place

396
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:07,520
um and have gotten some really nice

397
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:09,759
selections out of those

398
00:19:07,519 --> 00:19:13,158
environments uh one of our

399
00:19:09,759 --> 00:19:16,240
collaborators in Minnesota is doing some

400
00:19:13,159 --> 00:19:19,320
growth chamber work so subjecting P

401
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:22,159
plants to um a cold acclamation then a

402
00:19:19,319 --> 00:19:24,200
Sub-Zero acclamation then a freeze drop

403
00:19:22,159 --> 00:19:26,720
and then a recovery and seeing how they

404
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:29,279
do so anywhere from not being damaged at

405
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:31,919
all after that recovery to being

406
00:19:29,279 --> 00:19:36,319
completely dead he's

407
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:38,799
found um that okay so this is a

408
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:41,000
generation of selection here so the F3

409
00:19:38,798 --> 00:19:44,359
families in the Next Generation that he

410
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:47,279
selected so in the first generation

411
00:19:44,359 --> 00:19:51,119
there were

412
00:19:47,279 --> 00:19:53,960
um many families with complete death or

413
00:19:51,119 --> 00:19:57,279
a high proportion of complete death and

414
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:59,679
um very few families with no damage and

415
00:19:57,279 --> 00:20:02,480
then in just a generation he's got a lot

416
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:05,519
more families that have no damage and

417
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:07,679
fewer that have complete damage and you

418
00:20:05,519 --> 00:20:09,960
can see in these scores uh keeping in

419
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:12,798
mind that lower is better um that he's

420
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:16,759
make he's moving the needle on uh freeze

421
00:20:12,798 --> 00:20:19,079
tolerance with this growth chamber uh

422
00:20:16,759 --> 00:20:21,720
procedure we're doing some similar work

423
00:20:19,079 --> 00:20:24,079
here at Cornell one of our grad students

424
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:28,400
has a growth chamber or freeze chamber

425
00:20:24,079 --> 00:20:30,759
protocol of her own um seeking to um

426
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:35,600
both identify or refine previously

427
00:20:30,759 --> 00:20:39,038
identified genomic Losi or qtl um that

428
00:20:35,599 --> 00:20:42,519
have to do with uh cold tolerance in p

429
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:46,720
uh and so those genetic Losi would drive

430
00:20:42,519 --> 00:20:46,720
those biochemical mechanisms that I

431
00:20:47,119 --> 00:20:52,079
mentioned so future

432
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:54,038
opportunities um things that are

433
00:20:52,079 --> 00:20:56,639
happening we're going to do un firm

434
00:20:54,038 --> 00:20:59,839
trials with some CCB Network varieties

435
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:03,559
starting this fall so would love to have

436
00:20:59,839 --> 00:21:07,359
um as many of you as are able um

437
00:21:03,558 --> 00:21:09,599
participate in that um and then eten who

438
00:21:07,359 --> 00:21:13,199
maybe still on the phone is running some

439
00:21:09,599 --> 00:21:14,639
interesting um on-farm evaluations of

440
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:18,880
existing cover crops that you're going

441
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:21,320
to plant anyway and or a variety trial

442
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:24,000
of uh commercial varieties that will

443
00:21:21,319 --> 00:21:27,519
correspond with our um National

444
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:30,359
covercraft variety trial so watch this

445
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:32,240
space meaning the ceiling feed and the

446
00:21:30,359 --> 00:21:35,399
emails that I send to you for more

447
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:37,640
details on those things um I also would

448
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:40,960
really love to do some onir breeding

449
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:44,240
with some new material some crosses that

450
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:45,919
I've made um variable populations

451
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:47,440
ascending from those crosses and have

452
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:49,600
those selected in a lot of your

453
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:52,120
locations so that's still pending

454
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:54,639
funding but fingers

455
00:21:52,119 --> 00:21:57,199
crossed um and lastly for those of you

456
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:59,919
who are even

457
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:01,798
remotely of vicinity we're going to have

458
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:04,600
a cover crop and soil health field day

459
00:22:01,798 --> 00:22:06,200
on April 24th which is a Thursday in the

460
00:22:04,599 --> 00:22:08,399
afternoon you can see our breeding

461
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:10,440
material in the field uh the New York

462
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:12,240
soil Health Group will have their

463
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:14,600
trailer there to do some demonstrations

464
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:16,000
about cover crop uh uh water

465
00:22:14,599 --> 00:22:19,000
infiltration

466
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,720
and all manner of things uh we'll have

467
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,919
various demos we'd really love to have

468
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:26,400
you join us this is a production of

469
00:22:22,919 --> 00:22:26,400
Cornell University
