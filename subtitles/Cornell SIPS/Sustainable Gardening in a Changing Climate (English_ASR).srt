1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:05,040
this is a production of cornell

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:05,040
university

3
00:00:14,558 --> 00:00:18,640
okay yeah so maybe uh might be a couple

4
00:00:16,879 --> 00:00:21,358
of you that have heard me

5
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:23,359
talk before we've uh actually just had a

6
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:24,240
thing for master gardeners at cornell on

7
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:27,439
climate change

8
00:00:24,239 --> 00:00:28,879
um and uh it's the kind of thing i cover

9
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:30,000
now and then as i'll mention a little

10
00:00:28,879 --> 00:00:31,678
later i've also done

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,200
work as was mentioned with the new york

12
00:00:31,678 --> 00:00:35,039
botanic garden in the bronx

13
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,559
with their climate change program i

14
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:38,399
wanted to mention right here at the

15
00:00:36,558 --> 00:00:40,640
outset we have uh

16
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:42,840
a website at cornell called just pretty

17
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:45,439
easy to remember just climate

18
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:47,359
change.cornell.edu

19
00:00:45,439 --> 00:00:48,878
there might be a couple of you that have

20
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:51,280
been there before

21
00:00:48,878 --> 00:00:52,960
if so i encourage you to go back again

22
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,800
because it's just this last week i've

23
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:58,000
released in a totally new

24
00:00:54,799 --> 00:01:00,399
new and much ramped up version there's a

25
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,320
section there called up at the top one

26
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:03,759
of the buttons is tools and resources

27
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:06,400
and if you use the scroll down there's a

28
00:01:03,759 --> 00:01:08,239
section just for gardening

29
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,080
there's also a section just on kind of

30
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:11,438
basics of climate science which i'll go

31
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:12,239
through a little bit at the beginning

32
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:14,798
here

33
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:16,399
and things like craig is videotaping

34
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:17,040
this today and this will probably be

35
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,280
showing up

36
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,080
posted at that website this presentation

37
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,759
so there's

38
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:23,679
there's things like that to check out

39
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:25,680
there lots of good good resources

40
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:28,720
also i'll be showing some data for new

41
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,880
york and some analyses for new york

42
00:01:28,719 --> 00:01:32,400
what the new york climate's likely to do

43
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:34,239
particularly for our region

44
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,920
and a lot of it came from it is

45
00:01:34,239 --> 00:01:38,478
available at this particular website for

46
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:40,719
those of you that are interested

47
00:01:38,478 --> 00:01:42,078
it was a uh statewide both columbia and

48
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:43,840
cornell university

49
00:01:42,078 --> 00:01:45,599
pretty major project quite a few people

50
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,439
involved and there's sections on

51
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:49,759
the climate for new york there's sex and

52
00:01:47,438 --> 00:01:50,959
just on agriculture on ecosystems on

53
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:52,560
human health

54
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:54,319
all kinds of things there so i'll be

55
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:57,280
pulling from that quite a bit

56
00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:58,639
okay um so i've got i'm starting with a

57
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:01,200
couple of data slides it's not going to

58
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:04,960
be a whole lot of this kind of data

59
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:06,320
but um when i uh

60
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:09,118
talk climate change of course it's a

61
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:12,000
controversial issue a lot of

62
00:02:09,118 --> 00:02:12,479
information out there and i like sort of

63
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,719
i like

64
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:15,840
this graphic because it puts things in

65
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:17,598
perspective

66
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,039
about how we live on a planet where the

67
00:02:17,598 --> 00:02:21,759
climate's always been changing

68
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:23,519
long before humans were here and then

69
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:25,120
kind of lay over on that what humans

70
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,040
what the human impact

71
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:29,120
is uh and it's projected to be in just

72
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:30,959
the next 100 years or so

73
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,319
so this is a very long record this goes

74
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:35,519
back 400 000

75
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:37,359
years and the bottom trace there is the

76
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:38,879
temperatures going up and down on the

77
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,319
planet for you know almost half a

78
00:02:38,878 --> 00:02:43,280
million years

79
00:02:40,318 --> 00:02:44,560
these big dips would be uh the ice ages

80
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,199
that you all would be

81
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,680
you know generally familiar with and

82
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:49,039
these

83
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,360
uh and there's a lot of little ups and

84
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:54,239
downs here a lot of

85
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:56,000
what's causing all of this is been

86
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:58,319
studied for many years by

87
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,840
planetary scientists by meteorologists

88
00:02:58,318 --> 00:03:02,318
and climate scientists

89
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,360
and in fact one reason we have a fair

90
00:03:02,318 --> 00:03:05,598
amount of

91
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,680
confidence in the climate models we use

92
00:03:05,598 --> 00:03:10,000
to project future climate

93
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,959
is that we can do what they call hind

94
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,439
casting and

95
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:14,878
actually predict the past if you want

96
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:16,239
because we know what's going on here and

97
00:03:14,878 --> 00:03:18,479
causing some of these things

98
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:20,158
for example the big the big dips the ice

99
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:21,759
ages really have to do with an

100
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:24,158
astronomical thing

101
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:26,479
the earth's axis actually tilts a little

102
00:03:24,158 --> 00:03:28,959
bit on a 20 to 40 thousand year

103
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:31,039
cycle i'm not talking about the seasonal

104
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:32,239
changes or something like that

105
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:34,158
and there's some other cycles that

106
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:36,000
happen on a hundred thousand year basis

107
00:03:34,158 --> 00:03:38,798
that form some of these big

108
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,400
big dips and then you'll see how these

109
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:42,080
uh there's two greenhouse gasses

110
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,879
so-called greenhouse gases that

111
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:46,319
uh our inner atmosphere that play a role

112
00:03:44,878 --> 00:03:48,158
today as they have in the past in

113
00:03:46,318 --> 00:03:51,598
warming our planet

114
00:03:48,158 --> 00:03:53,679
methane ch4 and co2 is carbon dioxide

115
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:56,079
and you see how they kind of track all

116
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:57,760
of that and sometimes those gases are

117
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,519
responding to

118
00:03:57,759 --> 00:04:01,199
the temperature change and other times

119
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:02,640
they're driving the temperature change

120
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:05,280
for example

121
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:07,279
when due to the planetary astronomical

122
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:10,719
changes we start coming out of a

123
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,280
ice age notice these take a long time

124
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:13,039
this

125
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,400
keep in mind the time scale here takes

126
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:16,319
like 10 to 20

127
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,720
000 years for us to come out of an ice

128
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:21,439
age the last ice age was about 20

129
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,079
000 years ago and we came out of it

130
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:24,079
anyway as

131
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:25,280
the planet starts to warm because of the

132
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:28,639
planetary

133
00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:30,000
motions and tilt is changing that tends

134
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:33,439
to melt for example

135
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,199
permafrost which holds a lot of material

136
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:37,519
that when it warms up

137
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:39,600
and the and bacteria start working on it

138
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:40,560
releases methane and co2 into the

139
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,320
atmosphere so it

140
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,680
it just really feeds forward on itself

141
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:45,599
and speeds up this

142
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,439
that's why the warming is faster than

143
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,919
the cooling

144
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:52,000
anyway um and then as volcanoes erupt or

145
00:04:49,918 --> 00:04:53,198
whatever where they might produce co2

146
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,639
even before there were humans on the

147
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:56,079
planet that would tend to cause little

148
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:58,319
ups and downs

149
00:04:56,079 --> 00:05:00,319
um so you notice here ten thousand years

150
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:02,719
ago only ten thousand years ago

151
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:04,639
um still very few people on the planet

152
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,600
but that's about when crop domestication

153
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:07,840
started

154
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,919
so really as you can see we came up out

155
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:11,599
of a very cold period and reached a

156
00:05:09,918 --> 00:05:13,120
relatively stable period called the

157
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,800
holocene

158
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,478
and this certainly was you know is

159
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,919
considered by most anthropologists to be

160
00:05:16,478 --> 00:05:20,959
one of the leading

161
00:05:17,918 --> 00:05:22,079
reasons why the human population has

162
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:24,399
skyrocketed

163
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:25,680
since that time in part due to crop

164
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:27,679
domestication farm

165
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,600
starting with gardening and then into

166
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,639
farming and so we've reached a kind of

167
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:33,600
stable

168
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:34,478
stable period and to put some of my next

169
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,199
slides

170
00:05:34,478 --> 00:05:38,000
into perspective notice that we'll be

171
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:39,919
over about

172
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,918
ten thousand years fifteen thousand

173
00:05:39,918 --> 00:05:43,680
years as we came out of that ice age

174
00:05:41,918 --> 00:05:46,079
the temperature went up about eight to

175
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,439
ten degrees centigrade

176
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:49,439
in that period and we're right about

177
00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:50,800
here now and in my next slide i'm going

178
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:52,000
to show where we're going in probably

179
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:55,680
the next 100 years

180
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,199
or so oh

181
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,600
let me show you something else so this

182
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:01,199
is the co2 trace notice for the past

183
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,240
half million years the carbon dioxide

184
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:04,800
has been going

185
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,160
up and down between about 200 and 280

186
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,879
parts per million

187
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,520
so my next graph shows that just the co2

188
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:11,839
thing

189
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:12,639
but on a different y-axis scale because

190
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:13,599
i have to

191
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:15,199
show what's going to happen in the

192
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,560
future and it's going to go way up as

193
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:19,680
you might be

194
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:21,680
expecting so here's that same co2 the

195
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,038
x-axis is exactly the same going back

196
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:27,360
400 000 years

197
00:06:23,038 --> 00:06:30,478
here's the co2 going up and down um

198
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:32,960
between 200 and 280 parts per million we

199
00:06:30,478 --> 00:06:35,599
know about the old co2

200
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:36,799
because we have done these ice cores all

201
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,400
around the world and they actually

202
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,680
capture the air bubbles at different

203
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:41,120
depths in the ice

204
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,319
and they measure the co2 in those

205
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,240
bubbles and that's how we know what the

206
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:46,960
co2 concentrations were

207
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:49,120
years ago now we know what it is because

208
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:49,680
we have a you know a huge network around

209
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,840
the globe

210
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,598
of infrared gas analyzers that measure

211
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:55,359
the co2 in the atmosphere

212
00:06:53,598 --> 00:06:56,959
and so you know just since the

213
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,879
industrial revolution this is what's

214
00:06:56,959 --> 00:07:01,839
happened to the co2

215
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:02,879
um so we've gone way off already quite a

216
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:05,598
ways off

217
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:06,719
anything we've seen before and the scary

218
00:07:05,598 --> 00:07:08,079
part is to

219
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,560
so we and with you know with what's

220
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:12,800
happened so far the planet has warmed on

221
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:15,680
average almost a degree centigrade

222
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:17,038
or about a degree and a half fahrenheit

223
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,879
and then for the next hundred years

224
00:07:17,038 --> 00:07:21,360
here's what's projected

225
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:22,800
based on current fossil fuel emissions

226
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:26,160
so the magnitude

227
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:28,720
of that co2 rise and also the expected

228
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:30,639
corresponding temperature rise

229
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,479
is the kind of temperature change that

230
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:33,038
typically with those ice ages we see

231
00:07:32,478 --> 00:07:35,680
over 10

232
00:07:33,038 --> 00:07:37,360
000 years but now happening in 100 years

233
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:40,400
so that's what kind of has people

234
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:42,160
concerned um now of course this is the

235
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:43,679
so-called there's usually we present

236
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:46,319
climate data on sort of two different

237
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:48,079
scenarios basically

238
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:49,919
not changing much in what we're doing in

239
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:51,279
terms of fossil fuel use and greenhouse

240
00:07:49,918 --> 00:07:53,279
gases go to the atmosphere

241
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:54,559
and one moving towards a different

242
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:56,000
pattern

243
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,680
but what this kind of illustrates i

244
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,160
think is even in the best case scenario

245
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:01,360
we're

246
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:03,360
going to have some adapting to do um

247
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,479
to some climate change gardeners and

248
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,319
farmers and

249
00:08:04,478 --> 00:08:07,680
basically every business and every

250
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:10,000
person out there'll be a little

251
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:12,319
and every natural species out there have

252
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,918
some adjusting to do

253
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:16,080
what we want to do though is hopefully

254
00:08:13,918 --> 00:08:16,878
get into a mitigation mode so we don't

255
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:18,800
go

256
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:20,800
way up there because way up there

257
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,919
obviously the hudder gets

258
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:25,520
we get to a point where it's very

259
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:27,918
difficult to adapt and very costly

260
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:28,959
okay this is maybe getting down to

261
00:08:27,918 --> 00:08:30,719
something that's a little more familiar

262
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:32,399
to you the plant hardiness zone maps i

263
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,839
would assume many of you are familiar

264
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:35,200
with this the kind of things you can get

265
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:37,760
at garden centers

266
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:39,278
a color-coded map based on how cold it

267
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:40,479
gets the coldest it gets in the winter

268
00:08:39,278 --> 00:08:41,838
in different areas

269
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:43,360
and so of course in the north part it

270
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:45,200
gets colder and that's different color

271
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:48,320
code in the south

272
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:50,320
and these both these maps are designed

273
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,760
built the exact same way the usda does

274
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:54,959
them looking at the last

275
00:08:51,759 --> 00:08:57,039
15 years of weather station records

276
00:08:54,958 --> 00:08:59,439
for the area so the same kind of weather

277
00:08:57,039 --> 00:09:01,439
stations that give us our evening news

278
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,120
and when you do that you can see that

279
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,360
basically we have this so-called zone

280
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:07,759
creep no matter where you live

281
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,399
pretty much in the u.s you're in a

282
00:09:07,759 --> 00:09:11,039
warmer

283
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:12,159
hardiness zone than you were 15 20 years

284
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:13,278
ago in fact

285
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:15,519
with the one thing i've done with the

286
00:09:13,278 --> 00:09:18,240
new york botanic garden is about

287
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:19,278
six seven years ago now we planted a

288
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,039
test garden

289
00:09:19,278 --> 00:09:23,278
of all species that were one hardiness

290
00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:25,278
zone warmer than where they were

291
00:09:23,278 --> 00:09:26,320
to look at how those plants did and

292
00:09:25,278 --> 00:09:29,120
they're all

293
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:30,800
doing okay um one thing i want to

294
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,399
mention is you know as these zones

295
00:09:30,799 --> 00:09:34,159
change it's not just

296
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:36,080
what you might you know there's

297
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:37,519
certainly a silver lining to this you

298
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,320
might be able to grow something in your

299
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:40,879
garden

300
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:42,000
that your aunt rose or something grew

301
00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:45,039
south of you

302
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:47,039
and you always wanted to try

303
00:09:45,039 --> 00:09:49,278
but also you have to keep in mind that

304
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:53,039
also many insect pests

305
00:09:49,278 --> 00:09:54,879
and weeds etc their habitable zone

306
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:56,719
is dictated by how cold it gets in the

307
00:09:54,879 --> 00:09:58,320
winter so they're also moving and

308
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,278
there's lots of scientific literature

309
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,640
now showing

310
00:09:59,278 --> 00:10:04,399
indeed things are in the natural

311
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:06,799
landscape

312
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:07,919
all kinds of living things are tracking

313
00:10:06,799 --> 00:10:09,278
this

314
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:11,838
the other thing to think about when you

315
00:10:09,278 --> 00:10:12,720
look at this is while some species are

316
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:15,120
moving with

317
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:17,278
with this they aren't all moving some

318
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,799
species are more mobile than others

319
00:10:17,278 --> 00:10:21,519
and so one thing we're concerned about

320
00:10:18,799 --> 00:10:24,559
as ecologists is disruption of important

321
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:26,720
species interactions so for example

322
00:10:24,559 --> 00:10:27,679
if a prey item of some particular

323
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,519
predator

324
00:10:27,679 --> 00:10:30,958
does move with the climate but the the

325
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:33,440
predator can't do that then there would

326
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:36,639
be disruption there

327
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:37,760
if uh a natural enemy of a of a crop

328
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:39,919
pest

329
00:10:37,759 --> 00:10:41,679
does not track the pest itself then we

330
00:10:39,919 --> 00:10:43,120
might have some disruption there so

331
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:45,199
very concerned about those sorts of

332
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,720
things

333
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,240
um this is what really sort of gets to

334
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:51,040
me is because really my training is in

335
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:53,680
plant and soil ecology as was mentioned

336
00:10:51,039 --> 00:10:54,879
and um it's really the living world's

337
00:10:53,679 --> 00:10:57,120
already responding so

338
00:10:54,879 --> 00:10:58,399
forget the weather station data i mean

339
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,639
we can really look at

340
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:03,278
particularly perennial plants are really

341
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:05,759
sort of like in a way very complex

342
00:11:03,278 --> 00:11:07,519
sensitive weather instruments they

343
00:11:05,759 --> 00:11:09,120
integrate first of all

344
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:11,039
the winter temperatures because they

345
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,240
require a certain amount of chilling

346
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:13,679
some of you may know

347
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:16,240
a certain amount of cool temperatures in

348
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:18,479
the winter to be hormonally primed

349
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,839
in order to bloom in the spring and if

350
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,600
they don't get that much coolness

351
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:22,800
they're never going to bloom

352
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,480
and then on the other hand of course

353
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:24,799
then as the spring does come they kind

354
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,720
of

355
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:28,399
keep track of the degree days we call it

356
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:30,399
but basically the heat units

357
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:32,799
and then that's when they bloom and

358
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:35,039
anyway myself and a few other colleagues

359
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:37,120
uh gathered some historical records

360
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:39,759
going back to the 1960s

361
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:41,519
of these three species historical

362
00:11:39,759 --> 00:11:41,838
records of first bloom dates and saw

363
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:44,320
that

364
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:46,079
indeed on average all these species are

365
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:48,320
blooming several days earlier

366
00:11:46,078 --> 00:11:49,919
and now the peer-reviewed literature

367
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,839
scientific literature is really

368
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:53,199
you know just chock full of examples of

369
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:54,639
this happening

370
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:57,360
uh around the globe so definitely

371
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:59,360
something's happening with our climate

372
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,879
i already mentioned this kind of we do

373
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,800
worry about if the plants are blooming

374
00:12:00,879 --> 00:12:04,879
earlier are the pollinators

375
00:12:02,799 --> 00:12:06,399
going to be there keeping up and each

376
00:12:04,879 --> 00:12:07,679
species kind of responds a little

377
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:09,278
differently to climate change and you

378
00:12:07,679 --> 00:12:10,159
could have some disruption of species

379
00:12:09,278 --> 00:12:12,078
interactions

380
00:12:10,159 --> 00:12:13,278
particularly for highly specialized

381
00:12:12,078 --> 00:12:15,838
combinations

382
00:12:13,278 --> 00:12:16,799
of species so it's a concern and

383
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:20,000
something else that

384
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:20,000
ecologists are tracking

385
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,240
one particular thing for the northeast

386
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:26,560
is that

387
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:28,240
our winters are warming more than our

388
00:12:26,559 --> 00:12:29,759
annual average temperatures the average

389
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,278
annual temperatures are going up

390
00:12:29,759 --> 00:12:33,919
but the winters are warming more than

391
00:12:31,278 --> 00:12:35,439
the summers and that's a pretty common

392
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:37,199
thing the higher latitude you go the

393
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,880
more you see that phenomenon and part of

394
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,480
the thing is that

395
00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:42,159
when it's warmer in the winter there's

396
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:44,560
fewer snow cover days

397
00:12:42,159 --> 00:12:46,159
okay and if you think about snow it's

398
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:48,958
very reflective

399
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:49,679
so a lot of the radiation sun rays

400
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:51,439
coming down

401
00:12:49,679 --> 00:12:52,958
during the winter when there's snow on

402
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:54,399
the ground get reflected right back

403
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:55,838
up and don't do much heating of the

404
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:57,759
planet but if there's no snow there

405
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:59,600
instead of there's dark earth

406
00:12:57,759 --> 00:13:01,519
it heats up the planet so it's kind of

407
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:03,839
feeds forward on itself

408
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:05,360
so anyway pretty surprisingly over four

409
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:07,440
degrees of fahrenheit

410
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:09,759
over four degrees fahrenheit warming in

411
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:11,760
the northeast since the 1970s

412
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:14,000
that's based on the average december

413
00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:15,838
plus january plus february

414
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,440
temperature and there's the different

415
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:18,399
dots represent the different magnitude

416
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,760
of warming i wouldn't

417
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:20,720
put too much stock on that there's

418
00:13:19,759 --> 00:13:22,240
different you know there's a lot of

419
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:23,839
variation between the weather stations

420
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,480
some of it makes sense some of it may

421
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:26,000
not

422
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,759
different ways of how the weather

423
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,759
stations are handled but

424
00:13:27,759 --> 00:13:31,360
you don't see anywhere where there's uh

425
00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:32,799
it's going the opposite direction and

426
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,079
it's getting any cooler and basically

427
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:37,599
it's clearly warming

428
00:13:34,078 --> 00:13:37,599
and pretty dramatically in our winters

429
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:42,639
um that snow cover thing this is looking

430
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:44,560
a little bit into the future this is a

431
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:46,879
map that kind of tries to depict

432
00:13:44,559 --> 00:13:48,638
what the few but the models predict for

433
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:51,838
our future

434
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:54,879
the red zone shows the northeast and the

435
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:57,760
average based on the historical data

436
00:13:54,879 --> 00:13:59,838
where we have historically at least 30

437
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:02,559
days of snow cover

438
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:04,160
and the white is showing based on the

439
00:14:02,559 --> 00:14:05,119
higher emissions scenario kind of that

440
00:14:04,159 --> 00:14:07,600
worst case

441
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:09,360
scenario where we would have at least 30

442
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,560
days of snow cover by the end of the

443
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:12,959
century

444
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:14,000
so you know tremendous difference in

445
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:16,638
snow cover

446
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,240
and what i point out with the deer is

447
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:19,600
this isn't just a matter for those of

448
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,799
people who care about skiing and

449
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,839
thinking i've got to travel a little

450
00:14:20,799 --> 00:14:24,479
further to

451
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:25,680
do my skiing but it has an impact on all

452
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:27,519
kinds of um

453
00:14:25,679 --> 00:14:29,919
things that are really relevant to

454
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:32,000
gardeners for example

455
00:14:29,919 --> 00:14:34,559
deer i don't need to talk to a group of

456
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,078
gardeners about deer

457
00:14:34,559 --> 00:14:37,439
they're one of the big beneficiaries

458
00:14:36,078 --> 00:14:38,638
there's some winners and losers out

459
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,240
there in terms of climate change in

460
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:42,399
terms of the species out there

461
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:44,000
moose are a big loser because they can't

462
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:45,839
handle heat at all

463
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,519
we're likely to lose any moose it will

464
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:48,959
probably be very hard to find moose in

465
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:52,000
new york

466
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:53,439
within a couple decades but deer benefit

467
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,360
tremendously

468
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:56,639
first of all the warmer winters they

469
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:58,240
like that

470
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:00,240
they can stay healthier but more than

471
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:01,680
that it's that reduction in snow cover

472
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:03,600
because they can keep eating for longer

473
00:15:01,679 --> 00:15:05,198
there's more vegetation exposed

474
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,800
and so there's many more twins being

475
00:15:05,198 --> 00:15:07,919
born and just more bigger deer

476
00:15:06,799 --> 00:15:09,599
populations

477
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:11,360
and there's other reasons why they're

478
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:13,199
benefiting but that's one of them

479
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,560
it gets even more complicated i'm not

480
00:15:13,198 --> 00:15:15,679
going to go into what this slide is

481
00:15:14,559 --> 00:15:17,359
depicting but

482
00:15:15,679 --> 00:15:18,799
except to say that one of my graduate

483
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,480
students for example

484
00:15:18,799 --> 00:15:21,838
looked at what happens to the soil

485
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:23,759
microbes the

486
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:25,120
microbial ecology what happens in the

487
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:26,399
soil during the winter

488
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:28,720
and the microbes that are involved in

489
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:32,000
nitrogen cycling uh in

490
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:33,040
the winter is affected uh by snow cover

491
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,320
because the snow is actually an

492
00:15:33,039 --> 00:15:36,078
insulating blanket

493
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:38,839
keeps the soil actually a little warmer

494
00:15:36,078 --> 00:15:40,879
and etc has big impact on all kinds of

495
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:44,720
things

496
00:15:40,879 --> 00:15:47,120
okay warmer winters

497
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:48,639
you know i've been called out twice now

498
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,639
by the fruit growers

499
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:52,240
associations in new york state and

500
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:53,600
throughout the northeast and in michigan

501
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:57,440
as well

502
00:15:53,600 --> 00:16:00,480
to talk to them about not heat stress

503
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:03,040
in their apple and wine crops but why

504
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:06,320
they've got more freeze and frost damage

505
00:16:03,039 --> 00:16:08,480
in a warmer world and

506
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:10,240
so one example is what we most of you

507
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:12,159
probably you know felt yourself in your

508
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:15,519
own gardens just a couple of years ago

509
00:16:12,159 --> 00:16:17,838
when we had apples a true record breaker

510
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:19,600
four weeks earlier than normal bloom and

511
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:21,920
then there was a long window of

512
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,920
you know jeopardy of a frost event and

513
00:16:21,919 --> 00:16:26,078
in fact we lost about 50 to

514
00:16:23,919 --> 00:16:28,319
60 percent of our apple crop across the

515
00:16:26,078 --> 00:16:30,078
state so this premature bloom

516
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:32,639
can actually cause more freeze frost

517
00:16:30,078 --> 00:16:34,399
damage a few years earlier we had big

518
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:36,639
damage to some early

519
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:38,240
merlot some young merlot planting some

520
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:40,320
wine great plantings

521
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:42,639
in the state on the other end of winter

522
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:44,959
what happened was a very warm december

523
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:46,879
and the plants didn't harden properly

524
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:47,518
and then we had quote a normal january

525
00:16:46,879 --> 00:16:50,559
and they

526
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:51,919
they died from freeze damage so um

527
00:16:50,559 --> 00:16:54,000
that was not something i expected when i

528
00:16:51,919 --> 00:16:56,240
first got into this 20 25 years ago but

529
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,000
we now are developing a decision tool

530
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,759
for growers on adapting to climate

531
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,720
change it has to do with frost

532
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:02,639
prediction

533
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,759
and a lot of apple growers are actually

534
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:04,640
thinking about putting in different

535
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:06,480
systems

536
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:09,919
to protect them from frost damage

537
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:09,919
misters and different things

538
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:14,639
still kind of sticking to the new york

539
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:17,600
area and some

540
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:20,079
some major trends that we see that are

541
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:22,159
very characteristic of our area

542
00:17:20,078 --> 00:17:24,639
um each of these bars this goes back to

543
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:25,839
like the late 1800s each of these bars

544
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,600
actually

545
00:17:25,838 --> 00:17:29,839
represents the average for a whole

546
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:34,000
decade that that whole decade so like

547
00:17:29,839 --> 00:17:36,798
this last bar here is 2000 2000 to 2010

548
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,240
2001 to 2010. and you can see a very

549
00:17:36,798 --> 00:17:40,319
dramatic increase

550
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:42,400
in the number of heat stress days

551
00:17:40,319 --> 00:17:44,798
basically number of days over

552
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:46,720
90 degrees fahrenheit and also another

553
00:17:44,798 --> 00:17:47,440
unusual phenomenon that we didn't really

554
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:51,440
expect

555
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:52,160
early on was increase in heavy rainfall

556
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:55,120
events

557
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:56,240
not necessarily more rain over the whole

558
00:17:55,119 --> 00:17:58,639
year

559
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:00,000
but more of the rain that does come

560
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:02,480
coming down in heavy rainfall

561
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,119
events so we have kind of a heat stress

562
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:06,400
but also

563
00:18:03,119 --> 00:18:09,038
some short-term flooding events that

564
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:10,080
are a challenge for our area so that's

565
00:18:09,038 --> 00:18:12,879
um

566
00:18:10,079 --> 00:18:13,599
a pretty major thing and pretty uh

567
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,120
widespread

568
00:18:13,599 --> 00:18:16,480
across the northern hemisphere so

569
00:18:15,119 --> 00:18:17,519
something we have a pretty high degree

570
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:19,839
of confidence

571
00:18:17,519 --> 00:18:21,038
is you know here to stay kind of you

572
00:18:19,839 --> 00:18:23,759
might say

573
00:18:21,038 --> 00:18:25,038
what the rainfall is kind of associated

574
00:18:23,759 --> 00:18:25,679
with the fact that we're in a warmer

575
00:18:25,038 --> 00:18:28,319
world

576
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:30,160
basically more of the planet's water is

577
00:18:28,319 --> 00:18:31,359
up in the air as water vapor

578
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:33,519
because it's warmer and there's more

579
00:18:31,359 --> 00:18:35,439
evaporation and transpiration going on

580
00:18:33,519 --> 00:18:37,200
so when there's an upper atmosphere

581
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:40,480
cooling event to cause rainfall there's

582
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,480
basically more up there to come down

583
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:45,678
um this is a little bit of a complicated

584
00:18:44,079 --> 00:18:46,639
diagram but i wanted to show you that

585
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:49,120
despite

586
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:51,200
uh more frequent heavy rainfall events

587
00:18:49,119 --> 00:18:54,239
we actually also will have probably

588
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:57,200
more need for irrigation in the summers

589
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:58,960
in new york and the reason is simply

590
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,759
because it has to do with the balance

591
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:03,279
between

592
00:18:59,759 --> 00:19:04,960
uh warmer temperatures and longer

593
00:19:03,279 --> 00:19:07,440
growing seasons

594
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:09,440
uh causing crops and natural vegetation

595
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,080
and plants in the garden to require more

596
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,960
water

597
00:19:10,079 --> 00:19:13,279
the warmer it is the more transpiration

598
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,640
more

599
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:15,918
bigger the water needs are the longer

600
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:17,200
the growing season the more the longer

601
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:19,200
the plants are out there

602
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,400
and that's kind of depicted here with

603
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,919
the

604
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:23,440
showing two two different climate

605
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:25,600
scenarios and how much warming

606
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:27,279
might have in the summer but if you look

607
00:19:25,599 --> 00:19:28,879
at the summer rainfall it's predicted

608
00:19:27,279 --> 00:19:30,319
not to change much for our area

609
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,280
basically you can't see anything there

610
00:19:30,319 --> 00:19:34,079
because there's no

611
00:19:31,279 --> 00:19:35,918
change so in order not to have more

612
00:19:34,079 --> 00:19:37,839
drought steps we'd have to have

613
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:39,520
enough more rainfall to keep up with the

614
00:19:37,839 --> 00:19:40,959
increased temperatures if you follow

615
00:19:39,519 --> 00:19:43,839
what i'm saying

616
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:45,360
so we are a little better off well

617
00:19:43,839 --> 00:19:46,558
significantly better off than many parts

618
00:19:45,359 --> 00:19:48,079
of the world where

619
00:19:46,558 --> 00:19:49,678
the rainfall isn't staying the same at

620
00:19:48,079 --> 00:19:51,359
all in fact it's going way down

621
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:52,880
so it's kind of a double whammy you know

622
00:19:51,359 --> 00:19:54,240
warmer temperatures

623
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:56,080
more cropped man plus you're getting

624
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:58,880
much less rainfall but we're going to

625
00:19:56,079 --> 00:20:00,558
stay about the same in the summer but

626
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:04,480
still creates a little more drought

627
00:20:00,558 --> 00:20:04,480
stress than we might have seen before

628
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:08,960
so um those things i just covered were

629
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:10,879
some things where we have

630
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:13,440
quite a high degree of certainty i mean

631
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:15,120
things i think you know when you're

632
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:17,279
considering what to do in your garden i

633
00:20:15,119 --> 00:20:18,558
think you can sort of count on a lot of

634
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:19,839
evidence for those things

635
00:20:18,558 --> 00:20:21,918
i'm going to bring up a couple things

636
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:23,519
here that are a little less evidence

637
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:24,960
and a little more uncertainty about

638
00:20:23,519 --> 00:20:26,480
what's going on but something just to

639
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:28,880
put on your radar to kind of

640
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:31,120
be watching the news and see how some of

641
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:34,000
this science

642
00:20:31,119 --> 00:20:35,599
gets resolved over time um well the

643
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,599
arctic ice you may have heard on the

644
00:20:35,599 --> 00:20:39,918
news is melting right

645
00:20:37,599 --> 00:20:41,918
and you might think well you know polar

646
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:43,919
bears whatever i'm not you know that's

647
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:45,520
not going to affect my garden

648
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:47,200
but what we have found is that the

649
00:20:45,519 --> 00:20:49,519
melting of the arctic ice

650
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,880
is having an effect on the jet stream

651
00:20:49,519 --> 00:20:52,879
patterns

652
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:55,120
and so there's quite a consensus now

653
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:57,360
among the climate science community that

654
00:20:55,119 --> 00:20:58,959
the melting of the arctic ice is

655
00:20:57,359 --> 00:21:01,038
changing the jet stream patterns

656
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:02,400
where there's a lot of controversy is

657
00:21:01,038 --> 00:21:05,919
exactly how

658
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:08,559
and why and when and that's

659
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:09,360
you know still very complicated there's

660
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:12,639
a paper in

661
00:21:09,359 --> 00:21:14,240
scientific american december 2012 by

662
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:15,919
actually a colleague of mine at cornell

663
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:17,839
chuck greene

664
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:19,440
goes through his his take on all this

665
00:21:17,839 --> 00:21:21,599
and he actually predicts

666
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:23,519
deeper dips in the jet stream pattern so

667
00:21:21,599 --> 00:21:26,319
that actually if you have a cold front

668
00:21:23,519 --> 00:21:27,759
it could more freezes in florida despite

669
00:21:26,319 --> 00:21:30,798
a warmer world

670
00:21:27,759 --> 00:21:32,798
because of the arctic melting and

671
00:21:30,798 --> 00:21:34,639
slower moving jet streams which means

672
00:21:32,798 --> 00:21:35,519
every heat wave or any cold wave that we

673
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:37,759
might get

674
00:21:35,519 --> 00:21:39,200
lasts longer because it's slower moving

675
00:21:37,759 --> 00:21:40,319
but there's other climate scientists

676
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,279
that say no that's not how the jet

677
00:21:40,319 --> 00:21:42,720
streams are going to change it's going

678
00:21:41,279 --> 00:21:45,839
to change in a different way but

679
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,839
anyway something to keep in mind

680
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:49,840
i want to say something about direct

681
00:21:48,319 --> 00:21:51,279
carbon dioxide effects

682
00:21:49,839 --> 00:21:54,158
on plants and this is kind of

683
00:21:51,279 --> 00:21:56,000
interesting to think about

684
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:57,440
you probably all know that plants take

685
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,759
up carbon dioxide

686
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:00,558
for photosynthesis to produce sugars to

687
00:21:59,759 --> 00:22:03,038
grow

688
00:22:00,558 --> 00:22:05,200
so co2 is you know there's a so-called

689
00:22:03,038 --> 00:22:06,720
co2 fertilization effect and in fact if

690
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:09,120
you grow plants

691
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:11,200
most plants under optimum conditions no

692
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:14,558
no heat stress no climate change

693
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:17,038
no insect pests or anything

694
00:22:14,558 --> 00:22:18,319
they'll get a slight to a moderate to

695
00:22:17,038 --> 00:22:21,519
even a high boost

696
00:22:18,319 --> 00:22:24,558
in growth for at least a period of time

697
00:22:21,519 --> 00:22:26,079
just due to the higher carbon dioxide

698
00:22:24,558 --> 00:22:27,519
forget climate change even if there is

699
00:22:26,079 --> 00:22:29,918
no climate change

700
00:22:27,519 --> 00:22:31,200
this is an interesting study done at uh

701
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:33,280
duke university

702
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:35,200
this is looking at a down at a loblolly

703
00:22:33,279 --> 00:22:38,319
pine forest and these are huge

704
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:41,440
tall risers of pvc pipe

705
00:22:38,319 --> 00:22:42,720
as tall as the trees that are perforated

706
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:44,400
and each of these rings is at a

707
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,960
different you know some different co2

708
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:48,640
levels

709
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:50,240
by spewing in uh co2 quite an amazing

710
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:51,759
you know big big science project

711
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:53,440
millions of dollars

712
00:22:51,759 --> 00:22:54,798
the idea was to see how does the co2

713
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,320
gonna affect the tree growth and

714
00:22:54,798 --> 00:22:58,240
it did spur the tree growth for a period

715
00:22:56,319 --> 00:23:00,798
of time and then it sort of slowed

716
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:02,400
that impact slowed but actually some of

717
00:23:00,798 --> 00:23:04,079
the biggest news out of this

718
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,600
was that in the understory in the high

719
00:23:04,079 --> 00:23:07,279
co2

720
00:23:05,599 --> 00:23:09,439
rings the poison ivy grew like

721
00:23:07,279 --> 00:23:11,119
gangbusters

722
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:12,960
so much so that it really disturbed in a

723
00:23:11,119 --> 00:23:14,000
pretty major way their plans for the

724
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,919
study

725
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,599
and this actually you know has now been

726
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:18,400
documented that basically a lot of our

727
00:23:17,599 --> 00:23:21,038
most

728
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:22,000
aggressive fast-growing viney weeds

729
00:23:21,038 --> 00:23:25,519
benefit the most

730
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:27,359
from high co2 so

731
00:23:25,519 --> 00:23:29,599
that's an issue different plant species

732
00:23:27,359 --> 00:23:31,279
respond very differently so while

733
00:23:29,599 --> 00:23:32,959
many plant species can get a little

734
00:23:31,279 --> 00:23:34,639
boost some will get more than ever it

735
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:35,279
turns out our most aggressive invasive

736
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:38,320
weeds

737
00:23:35,279 --> 00:23:40,558
are the big winners in this story

738
00:23:38,319 --> 00:23:41,359
also my colleague lou ziska at the usda

739
00:23:40,558 --> 00:23:43,519
lab

740
00:23:41,359 --> 00:23:44,558
has done some work on use of herbicides

741
00:23:43,519 --> 00:23:47,119
to control

742
00:23:44,558 --> 00:23:47,918
weeds in high co2 environments and

743
00:23:47,119 --> 00:23:49,359
here's just a

744
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:51,600
picture illustration of one of his

745
00:23:49,359 --> 00:23:53,199
experiments looking at co2 levels

746
00:23:51,599 --> 00:23:55,119
predicted for

747
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:56,720
near mid to late century this is

748
00:23:55,119 --> 00:23:59,199
canadian thistle

749
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:01,440
um both of these were infected with you

750
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:03,600
know plenty of canadian thistle there

751
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,960
and on this side sprayed the recommended

752
00:24:03,599 --> 00:24:07,918
rate of glyphosate

753
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:09,038
roundup very common herbicide and well

754
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:11,360
on both sides sprayed

755
00:24:09,038 --> 00:24:13,440
the recommended rate and you got very

756
00:24:11,359 --> 00:24:15,038
little control on the high co2 side

757
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:16,720
so i had to go to like two to three

758
00:24:15,038 --> 00:24:18,960
times the rate

759
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:20,880
to get the same control which leads us

760
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:24,640
to a concern of how will farmers and

761
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:24,640
some gardeners be adapting to this

762
00:24:25,599 --> 00:24:29,038
spraying more herbicides so you know

763
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,798
there can be

764
00:24:29,038 --> 00:24:33,038
we can't really tie the hands of farmers

765
00:24:30,798 --> 00:24:33,759
as they adapt but we have to be prepared

766
00:24:33,038 --> 00:24:37,599
for

767
00:24:33,759 --> 00:24:37,599
some of these kinds of issues

768
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:42,880
anyway all of this that kind of ends my

769
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:44,320
climate change stuff i want to go now

770
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,960
more into impacts and what we can do in

771
00:24:44,319 --> 00:24:48,480
the garden

772
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:50,240
to adapt and mitigate um

773
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:53,120
there's you know little question i can't

774
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:54,480
tell you the details are very uncertain

775
00:24:53,119 --> 00:24:56,319
but i think we can say with a high

776
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:58,079
degree of certainty that the kind of

777
00:24:56,319 --> 00:24:59,200
climate change we're going and will be

778
00:24:58,079 --> 00:25:00,319
undergoing this century is going to

779
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:02,159
really change

780
00:25:00,319 --> 00:25:04,158
the very fabric of the natural

781
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:04,720
landscapes we see out there in various

782
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:07,039
ways

783
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:08,480
over the next several decades and of

784
00:25:07,038 --> 00:25:10,558
course this could have implications for

785
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:12,960
so-called ecosystem services

786
00:25:10,558 --> 00:25:15,519
everything from by ecosystem service i

787
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:17,919
mean bringing in tourism dollars

788
00:25:15,519 --> 00:25:19,519
for example the maple beach birch trees

789
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:20,960
are going to be less suitable for our

790
00:25:19,519 --> 00:25:22,960
climate in the future

791
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:25,440
i'll show a graphic on that in a moment

792
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:27,600
but also water quality

793
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:28,480
habitat for birds etcetera it could be

794
00:25:27,599 --> 00:25:30,959
disrupted

795
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:32,000
as different species come and go so some

796
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:33,360
now that there's not going to be any

797
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,038
vegetation out there

798
00:25:33,359 --> 00:25:37,199
but some of the existing species will

799
00:25:35,038 --> 00:25:39,440
have to go and others will be coming in

800
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:42,798
to take their place

801
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:45,038
this is showing a a study

802
00:25:42,798 --> 00:25:47,119
done basically on on modeling how the

803
00:25:45,038 --> 00:25:49,519
climate's changing in the northeast

804
00:25:47,119 --> 00:25:51,599
and tree specialists knowing how to

805
00:25:49,519 --> 00:25:54,079
model where trees grow

806
00:25:51,599 --> 00:25:56,079
looking at what that might mean for the

807
00:25:54,079 --> 00:25:57,278
trees major tree species mixes in the

808
00:25:56,079 --> 00:25:59,519
northeast

809
00:25:57,278 --> 00:26:01,679
based pretty much on the climate

810
00:25:59,519 --> 00:26:02,480
envelope uh so this doesn't mean this is

811
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:05,519
really

812
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:07,038
how exactly how the tree species will

813
00:26:05,519 --> 00:26:09,119
who's going to replace who because it

814
00:26:07,038 --> 00:26:10,319
depends on whether the the seed for the

815
00:26:09,119 --> 00:26:13,199
replacement trees

816
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:14,879
gets up here and all of that but if you

817
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:16,720
look at the current situation you see a

818
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:18,559
lot of gold color that's maple beach

819
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:19,120
birch that basically says new york is

820
00:26:18,558 --> 00:26:20,879
mostly

821
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:22,158
kind of very suitable for maple beach

822
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,960
birch and west where we see a lot of

823
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:24,799
those here

824
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:26,000
a little green here you see that spruce

825
00:26:24,798 --> 00:26:27,918
fur trees in the

826
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,679
adirondacks there's some of that in the

827
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:31,679
catskills too

828
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:33,200
now this is looking at the scenario for

829
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:34,960
the lower emissions and kind of the

830
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:37,519
worst case scenario

831
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:40,159
how that might change and you can see

832
00:26:37,519 --> 00:26:42,480
even in the kind of best case scenario

833
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:45,039
we lose the spruce fir from the

834
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:47,599
adirondacks basically from new york

835
00:26:45,038 --> 00:26:48,879
uh that is i can't really say they're

836
00:26:47,599 --> 00:26:50,879
going to disappear

837
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:52,000
but the the climate will no longer be

838
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,600
suitable for

839
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,919
spruce fur so some of them will be

840
00:26:53,599 --> 00:26:56,639
hanging on they'll be less healthy over

841
00:26:55,919 --> 00:27:00,559
time

842
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:02,640
and gradually they will be diminishing

843
00:27:00,558 --> 00:27:04,480
the gray that that's replacing some of

844
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:05,919
this this is the higher emissions

845
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,798
basically we lose a lot of our maple

846
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:11,200
beach birch

847
00:27:06,798 --> 00:27:12,400
is oak hickory pine so um

848
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:14,159
but you know our oak really going to

849
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,880
come up here and replace the maple beach

850
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:16,640
birch i mean

851
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:18,320
it's anybody's guess if the seeds can

852
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:19,600
disperse that way plus we got another

853
00:27:18,319 --> 00:27:20,639
problem i told you the deer are

854
00:27:19,599 --> 00:27:22,480
benefiting

855
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:24,880
they've done experiments and what tree

856
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:26,720
seedlings do deer prefer most oaks

857
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:28,320
so you know the tree species that's

858
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,798
likely to replace the maples is going to

859
00:27:28,319 --> 00:27:30,158
get

860
00:27:28,798 --> 00:27:32,000
eaten up by the deer so that's really

861
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:34,480
not likely to happen just to give you

862
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,720
one example of how complicated it is to

863
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:38,159
predict the future so all we can really

864
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:39,440
say is you know our

865
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:41,278
natural landscapes are going to be

866
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:42,640
disassembling and reassembling in new

867
00:27:41,278 --> 00:27:45,119
ways and it's not

868
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:47,038
you know it depends on you can be very

869
00:27:45,119 --> 00:27:49,038
pessimistic about this and get all down

870
00:27:47,038 --> 00:27:50,558
in the mouth or you might just say well

871
00:27:49,038 --> 00:27:52,079
let's you know nature is going to be

872
00:27:50,558 --> 00:27:53,839
changing and it's

873
00:27:52,079 --> 00:27:56,720
you know some you might some things

874
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:59,278
might be good some not so bad

875
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:00,880
um natural resource managers i'm working

876
00:27:59,278 --> 00:28:03,440
with the nature conservancy right now on

877
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:06,080
a climate change adaptation plan for

878
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:07,840
new york and it's really you know you

879
00:28:06,079 --> 00:28:09,678
can't really manage these days

880
00:28:07,839 --> 00:28:11,839
for keeping the exact same species there

881
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:13,600
forever right you really have to

882
00:28:11,839 --> 00:28:15,278
have be a little flexible and actually

883
00:28:13,599 --> 00:28:17,519
maybe even facilitate

884
00:28:15,278 --> 00:28:19,278
some other species to come in that have

885
00:28:17,519 --> 00:28:20,558
the same function as a species that's no

886
00:28:19,278 --> 00:28:22,480
longer suitable

887
00:28:20,558 --> 00:28:24,558
so really makes it very complicated for

888
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:26,159
natural resource managers but

889
00:28:24,558 --> 00:28:27,519
anyway that's what's happening but of

890
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:28,960
course in the garden there's the same

891
00:28:27,519 --> 00:28:30,960
sort of thing going on right all the

892
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:34,000
different garden plants you might

893
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:35,919
prefer some of them will be be able to

894
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,159
adapt to climate change and some will

895
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:39,440
have to you know gradually

896
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:41,360
be different species you might be

897
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:42,960
growing i'm not going to spend time on

898
00:28:41,359 --> 00:28:45,599
this it's just a

899
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:47,200
that that report i mentioned goes into a

900
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:48,398
lot of details about what trees are

901
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:50,720
likely to

902
00:28:48,398 --> 00:28:52,479
benefit gain suitable habitat which are

903
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:54,079
likely to lose habitat and

904
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:55,599
it's a lot of information out there like

905
00:28:54,079 --> 00:28:58,240
that

906
00:28:55,599 --> 00:28:59,759
so anyway to kind of set the stage for

907
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:02,319
what i want to talk about

908
00:28:59,759 --> 00:29:04,079
as i begin wrapping this up towards the

909
00:29:02,319 --> 00:29:06,319
adaptation piece is that

910
00:29:04,079 --> 00:29:07,839
you know for the northeast we're luckier

911
00:29:06,319 --> 00:29:08,639
than some parts of the world where it's

912
00:29:07,839 --> 00:29:11,278
already

913
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:13,360
as hot as you'd ever want it for us a

914
00:29:11,278 --> 00:29:15,919
warmer growing season and longer growing

915
00:29:13,359 --> 00:29:18,398
season has some potential silver lining

916
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:19,759
so there could be exploring new species

917
00:29:18,398 --> 00:29:21,759
and new varieties in fact gardeners can

918
00:29:19,759 --> 00:29:24,398
really be sort of at the forefront

919
00:29:21,759 --> 00:29:25,679
of exploring some of that it's harder

920
00:29:24,398 --> 00:29:27,359
for a farmer to do

921
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:30,399
a lot of experimenting because it's very

922
00:29:27,359 --> 00:29:33,199
expensive and involves their livelihood

923
00:29:30,398 --> 00:29:33,599
but anyway so um there's some of that

924
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,960
but

925
00:29:33,599 --> 00:29:37,119
you know there's some of our favorites

926
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:39,200
we might have to eventually give up on

927
00:29:37,119 --> 00:29:40,798
and then we are going to have certainly

928
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:42,319
weeds disease and insects

929
00:29:40,798 --> 00:29:44,319
like we haven't seen before in the

930
00:29:42,319 --> 00:29:45,918
northeast if you think of what it's like

931
00:29:44,319 --> 00:29:47,918
south of here and what gardeners there

932
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:49,440
have to face that's the kind of thing

933
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:50,559
we'll be facing

934
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:52,320
and we're going to have more summer heat

935
00:29:50,558 --> 00:29:54,240
stress than we've seen before still not

936
00:29:52,319 --> 00:29:56,639
as bad as some other places but

937
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:58,240
worse than it has been here before and

938
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:00,720
we have the water management problem of

939
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:03,839
both some flooding events and also more

940
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:06,079
uh dry dry parts of the summer so uh

941
00:30:03,839 --> 00:30:08,558
nothing that we can't adapt to as long

942
00:30:06,079 --> 00:30:10,720
as we don't go on to that drastic

943
00:30:08,558 --> 00:30:11,839
path but you know something to be

944
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:13,839
thinking about

945
00:30:11,839 --> 00:30:15,278
this is an interesting example i think

946
00:30:13,839 --> 00:30:17,759
just showing

947
00:30:15,278 --> 00:30:18,798
the case for european wine grapes which

948
00:30:17,759 --> 00:30:20,240
are

949
00:30:18,798 --> 00:30:22,960
you know so important to our finger

950
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:24,720
lakes area and just showing you

951
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:26,000
how that affects just within a single

952
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:28,960
species

953
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,319
vitus binifera how the varieties respond

954
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:32,319
so this is our current

955
00:30:30,319 --> 00:30:33,599
new york growing season in terms of its

956
00:30:32,319 --> 00:30:35,839
average temperature

957
00:30:33,599 --> 00:30:37,839
and you can see this is why we do good

958
00:30:35,839 --> 00:30:39,359
rieslings in this area and chardonnays

959
00:30:37,839 --> 00:30:41,199
we're right in that zone

960
00:30:39,359 --> 00:30:42,959
but here's what our climate's projected

961
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:44,319
to be by 2050

962
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:46,000
so we're really on the fringe of being

963
00:30:44,319 --> 00:30:48,558
able to do good chardonnays but where

964
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:50,640
now we can do those merlots and cabernet

965
00:30:48,558 --> 00:30:52,879
sauvignons that the napa valley

966
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:53,919
can do all right and really you know

967
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:58,399
opportunities

968
00:30:53,919 --> 00:31:00,640
no seriously um now napa valley today

969
00:30:58,398 --> 00:31:02,319
is right about here and what napa valley

970
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:04,159
is looking at is just the next 30 years

971
00:31:02,319 --> 00:31:05,918
is going off the deep end

972
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:07,519
and so for the napa valley it's kind of

973
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:09,840
bad news for

974
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:10,960
the wine grape industry opportunity for

975
00:31:09,839 --> 00:31:11,759
us but i think this is kind of

976
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:13,679
illustrative

977
00:31:11,759 --> 00:31:15,599
even for us by the end of the century we

978
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:19,360
really get awfully hot

979
00:31:15,599 --> 00:31:20,879
even for some of the grape varieties so

980
00:31:19,359 --> 00:31:22,398
but that's kind of what's that's the

981
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:26,240
world we live in today

982
00:31:22,398 --> 00:31:27,918
so um okay i already mentioned this kind

983
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:28,640
of you know warmer winters there's lots

984
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:30,399
of

985
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:31,759
potential pests that we don't have

986
00:31:30,398 --> 00:31:32,479
because in the winter they get killed

987
00:31:31,759 --> 00:31:35,038
off

988
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:36,399
includes the fleas on our dogs and

989
00:31:35,038 --> 00:31:38,720
garden pests and everything

990
00:31:36,398 --> 00:31:40,719
these are just examples of a few that

991
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:41,360
are all showing up more this is a flea

992
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:44,240
beetle

993
00:31:41,359 --> 00:31:46,319
it's the carries a big corn disease

994
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:47,919
called stewart's wilt and

995
00:31:46,319 --> 00:31:49,599
so it's a vector for that disease it

996
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:51,519
used to marginally over winter here now

997
00:31:49,599 --> 00:31:54,558
it overwinters very often

998
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:56,159
a particular ear iron cornea worm kudzu

999
00:31:54,558 --> 00:31:57,839
some of you from the south may be

1000
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:59,519
aware of that very aggressive it's

1001
00:31:57,839 --> 00:32:00,879
another one like poison ivy gains from

1002
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:03,278
the high co2

1003
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:05,519
as well as the warming temperature has

1004
00:32:03,278 --> 00:32:08,159
historically kept kudzu south of here

1005
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:09,599
and now it's showing up more north this

1006
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:10,880
is some modeling work we did of the

1007
00:32:09,599 --> 00:32:13,119
kudzu

1008
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:14,159
habitable range changing with time so we

1009
00:32:13,119 --> 00:32:16,479
go from

1010
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:18,000
current day or short term to end of

1011
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:20,079
century

1012
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,919
business as usual kind of a higher

1013
00:32:20,079 --> 00:32:22,558
emission scenario worst case scenario

1014
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:24,320
better

1015
00:32:22,558 --> 00:32:27,200
and this the dark orange is basically

1016
00:32:24,319 --> 00:32:30,639
the kudzu habitable range

1017
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:33,360
you know coming to get us so get ready

1018
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:34,080
um this is showing hemlock wooly adelgid

1019
00:32:33,359 --> 00:32:35,918
a big

1020
00:32:34,079 --> 00:32:38,798
little tiny aphid-like insect that is

1021
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:40,640
moving northward with climate change

1022
00:32:38,798 --> 00:32:42,879
uh being very destructive to hemlock

1023
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:45,679
stands in the northeast

1024
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:45,679
so adapting

1025
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,519
so first of all plant selection

1026
00:32:47,839 --> 00:32:51,038
diversifying this is what a lot of

1027
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:52,399
farmers are doing and i think it's you

1028
00:32:51,038 --> 00:32:54,640
know it's a time in the garden

1029
00:32:52,398 --> 00:32:56,000
already to start thinking about mixing

1030
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:58,000
it up maybe a little bit more to

1031
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,679
see there might be something of interest

1032
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,759
you'd like to try that

1033
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:02,880
requires a slightly warmer temperature

1034
00:33:01,759 --> 00:33:04,558
might do better now

1035
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:07,039
and also to head your bets just to make

1036
00:33:04,558 --> 00:33:08,480
sure you get you know what you want

1037
00:33:07,038 --> 00:33:10,000
because we don't really know what the

1038
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:11,440
you know climate's going to throw at us

1039
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,240
the weather is going to throw at us

1040
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:14,880
so experimenting is definitely something

1041
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:17,120
to be doing

1042
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:20,559
in terms of plant selection certainly we

1043
00:33:17,119 --> 00:33:22,239
can think about earlier planting dates

1044
00:33:20,558 --> 00:33:24,398
more vigilant weed and pest monitoring

1045
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:25,759
and control a lot of things with water

1046
00:33:24,398 --> 00:33:27,678
management

1047
00:33:25,759 --> 00:33:29,200
besides the idea of you know irrigation

1048
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:31,360
or drainage or moving

1049
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:32,880
your garden to a place that's better

1050
00:33:31,359 --> 00:33:35,278
drained or whatever

1051
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:37,440
um just building healthier soils with

1052
00:33:35,278 --> 00:33:39,440
more organic matter that gives

1053
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:40,480
better water holding capacity to buffer

1054
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:42,000
you from drought

1055
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:43,919
and better drainage to buffer you from

1056
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,960
flooding so doing that sort of thing

1057
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:46,240
that many of you are probably already

1058
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:48,240
doing in the garden

1059
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:49,839
more reasons for that and then frost and

1060
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:51,278
freeze protection for those perennial

1061
00:33:49,839 --> 00:33:53,839
plants in those years where we

1062
00:33:51,278 --> 00:33:55,839
have jeopardy due to a very uneven

1063
00:33:53,839 --> 00:33:58,000
winter and early spring

1064
00:33:55,839 --> 00:33:59,839
temperature and commercial growers are

1065
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,759
doing a lot about that

1066
00:33:59,839 --> 00:34:04,158
in the landscape this is what we saw we

1067
00:34:01,759 --> 00:34:05,759
do a lot of our landscape planting

1068
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:07,440
compacting the heck out of soil delay

1069
00:34:05,759 --> 00:34:08,559
cement um

1070
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:10,079
and this is the kind of thing if we're

1071
00:34:08,559 --> 00:34:11,838
having more frequent rainfall a lot of

1072
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:13,599
urban areas are looking at this is an

1073
00:34:11,838 --> 00:34:14,878
issue because it creates more flooding

1074
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:16,720
and all of that

1075
00:34:14,878 --> 00:34:18,480
neenah basic at cornell has worked with

1076
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:21,358
this stuff called structural soil which

1077
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:23,519
is basically a mixture of rocks and soil

1078
00:34:21,358 --> 00:34:25,598
that allows you to compact soils for

1079
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:28,878
asphalt and cement laying

1080
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:31,119
in urban areas and

1081
00:34:28,878 --> 00:34:32,960
but avoid compacting it so much that

1082
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:34,399
plants can grow underneath that

1083
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:36,320
and also that you can't have good

1084
00:34:34,398 --> 00:34:37,918
drainage so that's one way

1085
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:39,599
sort of people are beginning to adapt to

1086
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:41,918
climate change at the landscape

1087
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:43,519
planting level also porous asphalt is

1088
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:45,838
another thing

1089
00:34:43,519 --> 00:34:46,800
plant a tree getting into kind of the

1090
00:34:45,838 --> 00:34:49,679
real

1091
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:50,960
not so much coping with the inevitable

1092
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:52,159
climate change

1093
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:54,720
which is what i've been kind of talking

1094
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:56,079
about so far how do we like deal with it

1095
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:58,239
this is more like being part of the

1096
00:34:56,079 --> 00:35:02,640
solution and so

1097
00:34:58,239 --> 00:35:04,799
certainly plants take up carbon dioxide

1098
00:35:02,639 --> 00:35:06,960
and there's a lot of trees that have a

1099
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:10,240
lot of carbon in them a lot of trees

1100
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:10,880
in uh in new york a lot of million tons

1101
00:35:10,239 --> 00:35:12,959
of carbon

1102
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:15,039
all those trees that carbon if they all

1103
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:17,119
were chopped down and

1104
00:35:15,039 --> 00:35:18,400
destroyed decomposed or burned all that

1105
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:19,358
carbon go back into the atmosphere of

1106
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:21,039
co2 so

1107
00:35:19,358 --> 00:35:23,119
trees are a big storage pool of carbon

1108
00:35:21,039 --> 00:35:25,358
so certainly keeping the trees we have

1109
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:27,599
it's an added incentive

1110
00:35:25,358 --> 00:35:29,519
to keep those but then also this idea of

1111
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:32,800
planting a tree

1112
00:35:29,519 --> 00:35:34,800
sucking up that co2 uh and indeed

1113
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:36,640
plants do you know take up the carbon

1114
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:38,320
however they do lose some carbon

1115
00:35:36,639 --> 00:35:40,639
not as much as they take up they usually

1116
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:42,800
store more than they give off

1117
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:43,759
but it's kind of a balance and the bad

1118
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:45,519
news is

1119
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:46,880
for the average of us it would probably

1120
00:35:45,519 --> 00:35:49,679
take 20 trees

1121
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:50,720
to take up as much co2 as you emit in a

1122
00:35:49,679 --> 00:35:52,559
year

1123
00:35:50,719 --> 00:35:54,639
so you'd have to plant 20 trees like

1124
00:35:52,559 --> 00:35:57,759
every year to keep up with your

1125
00:35:54,639 --> 00:35:58,078
with your co2 emissions um so when like

1126
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,359
uh

1127
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:01,280
you know mayors like to say we're gonna

1128
00:35:59,358 --> 00:36:03,598
do a tree planting and we're gonna solve

1129
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:05,040
climate change and uh you can if you do

1130
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:06,720
the math and what do we take in new york

1131
00:36:05,039 --> 00:36:09,440
city to solve it with

1132
00:36:06,719 --> 00:36:10,239
trees but i don't want to be too

1133
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:12,720
facetious

1134
00:36:10,239 --> 00:36:14,399
um because actually it's this piece

1135
00:36:12,719 --> 00:36:15,598
that's very interesting this has a big

1136
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:17,599
cooling effect

1137
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:19,359
plus the shade of trees and actually

1138
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:21,599
people who've done the number crunching

1139
00:36:19,358 --> 00:36:23,119
when you add that in trees have a pretty

1140
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:25,760
substantial benefit

1141
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:26,160
so the cooling effect of trees can out

1142
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:28,400
you know

1143
00:36:26,159 --> 00:36:29,759
in terms of urban areas and reducing the

1144
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:32,240
use of air conditioners

1145
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:33,680
um is where the big uh climate change

1146
00:36:32,239 --> 00:36:35,439
mitigation piece

1147
00:36:33,679 --> 00:36:36,960
uh comes in and the trees i don't want

1148
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:38,000
to take away i mean they do take up some

1149
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:39,199
carbon so they

1150
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:42,559
they place some benefit there but

1151
00:36:39,199 --> 00:36:44,319
they're not going to solve the problem

1152
00:36:42,559 --> 00:36:45,599
um nitrogen management i want to bring

1153
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:46,720
this up not

1154
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:49,359
you know that many people are really

1155
00:36:46,719 --> 00:36:51,838
aware of how big

1156
00:36:49,358 --> 00:36:53,679
a problem relevant to climate change

1157
00:36:51,838 --> 00:36:55,519
that nitrogen fertilizer is because

1158
00:36:53,679 --> 00:36:58,159
when nitrogen fertilizer first of all if

1159
00:36:55,519 --> 00:37:00,559
you buy synthetic nitrogen fertilizers

1160
00:36:58,159 --> 00:37:02,319
it takes four to six tons of 46 tons of

1161
00:37:00,559 --> 00:37:03,199
carbon are typically emitted into the

1162
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:06,079
atmosphere

1163
00:37:03,199 --> 00:37:07,358
for a ton of nitrogen manufactured so in

1164
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:09,440
other words if you go to the garden and

1165
00:37:07,358 --> 00:37:11,039
you go to the gardening center and you

1166
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:12,559
buy a bag of urea

1167
00:37:11,039 --> 00:37:14,719
you just you know upped your carbon

1168
00:37:12,559 --> 00:37:16,320
footprint

1169
00:37:14,719 --> 00:37:19,039
all nitrogen fertilizers even if you're

1170
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:20,480
using manures or compost

1171
00:37:19,039 --> 00:37:22,480
the nitrogen that's in them as it

1172
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:23,519
decomposes and becomes available for

1173
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:27,039
plant roots

1174
00:37:23,519 --> 00:37:28,400
there is a sort of a

1175
00:37:27,039 --> 00:37:30,559
something you can't control the

1176
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:32,240
microbial activity involved in the

1177
00:37:30,559 --> 00:37:34,639
nitrogen cycle releases a little bit of

1178
00:37:32,239 --> 00:37:37,279
this gas called nitrous oxide which is

1179
00:37:34,639 --> 00:37:39,920
a third very important greenhouse gas in

1180
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:42,720
fact on a molecule per molecule basis

1181
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:44,800
300 times more potent than co2 as a in

1182
00:37:42,719 --> 00:37:46,799
terms of its warming potential

1183
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:49,119
and when you do the pie chart on for

1184
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:52,720
example u.s agricultural

1185
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:53,920
contributions to climate change and

1186
00:37:52,719 --> 00:37:56,719
global warming

1187
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:57,519
it's not the co2 from driving tractors

1188
00:37:56,719 --> 00:37:59,118
or whatever

1189
00:37:57,519 --> 00:38:00,880
it's the nitrous oxide emissions from

1190
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:03,119
fertilizer that's over the largest

1191
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:06,079
fraction of the pie

1192
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:06,720
um so anything you can do to be more

1193
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:09,760
efficient

1194
00:38:06,719 --> 00:38:11,679
and conservative about nitrogen use

1195
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:12,720
is is probably the biggest thing one of

1196
00:38:11,679 --> 00:38:14,159
the biggest things you can do in the

1197
00:38:12,719 --> 00:38:16,319
garden

1198
00:38:14,159 --> 00:38:17,598
um over three million acres of lawn in

1199
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,079
new york a lot of those get a lot of

1200
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:21,119
nitrogen

1201
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:22,079
fertilizer unnecessarily i think part of

1202
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:23,680
the issue is

1203
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:25,359
you know trying to have you want your

1204
00:38:23,679 --> 00:38:27,039
lawn to be the first to green up in the

1205
00:38:25,358 --> 00:38:27,358
spring instead of letting the soils warm

1206
00:38:27,039 --> 00:38:29,440
up

1207
00:38:27,358 --> 00:38:31,920
let the microbes go to work that release

1208
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:34,000
some nitrogen naturally

1209
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:35,358
so early applications of nitrogen

1210
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,440
fertilizer are you know

1211
00:38:35,358 --> 00:38:39,279
something to kind of think about holding

1212
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:40,800
back on mature lawns really don't

1213
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:42,720
require much nitrogen

1214
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:44,720
and we have some guidelines and frank

1215
00:38:42,719 --> 00:38:47,199
rossi at cornell 2 has developed

1216
00:38:44,719 --> 00:38:48,879
some detailed guidelines on how you can

1217
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:50,239
be more efficient in terms of nitrogen

1218
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:54,400
management on

1219
00:38:50,239 --> 00:38:57,679
lawns using legumes you know these are

1220
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:59,440
plants that actually capture nitrogen

1221
00:38:57,679 --> 00:39:01,919
from the air and then make it available

1222
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:03,519
to the soil and subsequent plants in the

1223
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:04,559
environment so farmers are looking at

1224
00:39:03,519 --> 00:39:06,639
this instead of

1225
00:39:04,559 --> 00:39:10,000
synthetic nitrogen fertilizer so i'm

1226
00:39:06,639 --> 00:39:10,000
mixing those up in the garden

1227
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:14,880
i'd like to show this slide like when i

1228
00:39:12,719 --> 00:39:15,598
go to policy briefings in dc and see how

1229
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:17,680
long

1230
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:18,880
it takes the audience to see what it is

1231
00:39:17,679 --> 00:39:21,358
guess what it is

1232
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:22,480
um but i don't know what you see there

1233
00:39:21,358 --> 00:39:25,358
but i see

1234
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:26,960
you know nitrogen carbon and energy

1235
00:39:25,358 --> 00:39:29,119
that's going to waste

1236
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:30,320
if we don't recycle so certainly you

1237
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:32,240
know using these kind of

1238
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:33,519
organic sources of nitrogen is a big you

1239
00:39:32,239 --> 00:39:34,159
know you're avoiding that carbon

1240
00:39:33,519 --> 00:39:39,280
footprint

1241
00:39:34,159 --> 00:39:40,719
of buying synthetic nitrogen fertilizers

1242
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:42,400
another thing is you know out in the

1243
00:39:40,719 --> 00:39:44,639
garden every time you're out there

1244
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:46,160
tilling the soil just like we tell

1245
00:39:44,639 --> 00:39:48,719
farmers out there with their big tillage

1246
00:39:46,159 --> 00:39:51,358
equipment plowing and mixing it up

1247
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:52,719
do ask yourself why am i doing this and

1248
00:39:51,358 --> 00:39:54,078
make sure you have a good reason for

1249
00:39:52,719 --> 00:39:54,639
doing it because what you're doing is

1250
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:57,280
really

1251
00:39:54,639 --> 00:39:58,000
pumping oxygen into the soil and what

1252
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:00,560
that does

1253
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:02,079
is speeds up the microbial breakdown of

1254
00:40:00,559 --> 00:40:03,679
organic carbon

1255
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:06,000
and where does that carbon go but up

1256
00:40:03,679 --> 00:40:08,239
into the atmosphere as co2 so you're

1257
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,599
decreasing you know the stability of the

1258
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:11,279
organic matter that you already have in

1259
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:14,480
your soil and you're losing it

1260
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:16,880
a lot of times it starts particularly in

1261
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:18,159
agricultural situations with compaction

1262
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:20,800
and then there's this need where we need

1263
00:40:18,159 --> 00:40:22,879
to till the soil to avoid the compaction

1264
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:24,240
but then as i say that over aerates the

1265
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:26,400
soil

1266
00:40:24,239 --> 00:40:28,479
you burn off that organic matter and

1267
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:30,720
then you have a soil that's less

1268
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:32,559
healthy for microbes the microbes are

1269
00:40:30,719 --> 00:40:34,239
very important in creating a soil that's

1270
00:40:32,559 --> 00:40:35,440
well aggregated and has good drainage

1271
00:40:34,239 --> 00:40:36,239
and you end up with kind of a vicious

1272
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:38,480
circle

1273
00:40:36,239 --> 00:40:39,358
so when you're out there in the garden

1274
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,800
killing

1275
00:40:39,358 --> 00:40:42,159
for example you can till just where you

1276
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:43,280
have to plant the seeds and not the

1277
00:40:42,159 --> 00:40:44,799
whole garden

1278
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:46,079
so really reducing tillage you probably

1279
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:47,599
heard about a lot of farmers going to

1280
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:49,039
no-till or reduced still

1281
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:51,119
and part of it is to build organic

1282
00:40:49,039 --> 00:40:55,119
matter in their soils but also

1283
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:57,200
it's you know reducing the co2 emissions

1284
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:59,440
so building soil organic matter reducing

1285
00:40:57,199 --> 00:41:00,399
tillage using cover crops manures and

1286
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:02,318
compost

1287
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:03,838
all of that stores carbon in the soil

1288
00:41:02,318 --> 00:41:07,440
that otherwise would be up in the air

1289
00:41:03,838 --> 00:41:09,599
as co2 you've done your good deed

1290
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:11,358
also increases resilience as we said

1291
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:13,599
before to drought and flooding so

1292
00:41:11,358 --> 00:41:15,838
kind of adaptation and mitigation

1293
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:18,800
combined

1294
00:41:15,838 --> 00:41:20,078
finally while i'm sure many of you grow

1295
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:22,880
some of your own food

1296
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:24,480
you also are at wegmans or the farmer's

1297
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:26,640
market or whatever

1298
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:28,639
buying food and you know think about you

1299
00:41:26,639 --> 00:41:30,159
know your choices and how they affect

1300
00:41:28,639 --> 00:41:31,598
what farmers do

1301
00:41:30,159 --> 00:41:33,358
and there's been there's a big you know

1302
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:34,880
major movement happening now

1303
00:41:33,358 --> 00:41:37,039
around the country and around much of

1304
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:40,720
the developed world for sure

1305
00:41:37,039 --> 00:41:42,559
of consumers and restaurateurs

1306
00:41:40,719 --> 00:41:43,838
chefs wanting to know where their food's

1307
00:41:42,559 --> 00:41:45,279
coming from wanting to know how the

1308
00:41:43,838 --> 00:41:46,960
farmers are farming

1309
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:49,839
and creating creating a whole back

1310
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:53,199
demand for farmers to kind of be doing

1311
00:41:49,838 --> 00:41:55,519
the right thing in terms of mitigation

1312
00:41:53,199 --> 00:41:56,480
so finally this is my last slide i think

1313
00:41:55,519 --> 00:41:58,719
just

1314
00:41:56,480 --> 00:42:00,400
kind of summarizing this planting trees

1315
00:41:58,719 --> 00:42:02,879
and other perennials in the garden

1316
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:04,559
all of that does help to cool the

1317
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:06,318
environment reducing human energies and

1318
00:42:04,559 --> 00:42:08,559
also sequesters carbon

1319
00:42:06,318 --> 00:42:10,159
you know in that woody biomass and that

1320
00:42:08,559 --> 00:42:11,199
perennial biomass and the roots of those

1321
00:42:10,159 --> 00:42:13,279
perennials so

1322
00:42:11,199 --> 00:42:15,039
that's a very good thing to be doing and

1323
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:17,599
i like to say the gardeners

1324
00:42:15,039 --> 00:42:18,800
you know you can do less in the garden

1325
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:22,559
and you're doing your part

1326
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:25,599
okay don't be out there tilling the soil

1327
00:42:22,559 --> 00:42:25,599
as much as you used to

1328
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:30,240
don't fertilize your nitrogen your lawn

1329
00:42:28,239 --> 00:42:33,439
as as much as you used to don't mow the

1330
00:42:30,239 --> 00:42:35,358
lawn as often as you used to

1331
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:37,519
use less fossil fuels replace with

1332
00:42:35,358 --> 00:42:39,279
renewables reduce use of disposable

1333
00:42:37,519 --> 00:42:42,000
plastics all of those things

1334
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:42,560
are really a big part of the mitigation

1335
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,920
things

1336
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:46,239
and then of course thinking about buying

1337
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:51,200
local growing some of your own

1338
00:42:46,239 --> 00:42:51,199
etc and i'll stop at that

1339
00:42:56,838 --> 00:42:59,838
thanks

1340
00:43:03,838 --> 00:43:07,519
yeah so every year i kind of get asked

1341
00:43:05,519 --> 00:43:08,079
you know by the news media about what's

1342
00:43:07,519 --> 00:43:09,280
the this

1343
00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:11,280
what's the weather this year what's the

1344
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:12,000
fall color going to be and all that

1345
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:15,280
there are certain

1346
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:17,760
conditions that are supposed to be um

1347
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:18,640
you know characteristic of good fall

1348
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:21,440
color

1349
00:43:18,639 --> 00:43:23,440
and um one thing is we had the only

1350
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:25,599
answer i have is that this fall

1351
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:27,838
was truly delayed which is something we

1352
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:29,920
we see more earliness

1353
00:43:27,838 --> 00:43:31,679
in the spring than we see delay in the

1354
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:32,559
fall it's more dramatic on the spring

1355
00:43:31,679 --> 00:43:35,358
side normally

1356
00:43:32,559 --> 00:43:36,799
because we have much warmer winters but

1357
00:43:35,358 --> 00:43:38,239
this year we saw a significant delay in

1358
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:41,280
the fall and a very long

1359
00:43:38,239 --> 00:43:43,759
warm fall so what happens as

1360
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:45,519
temperatures cool in the fall is the

1361
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:48,160
green color the chlorophyll in the

1362
00:43:45,519 --> 00:43:50,880
leaves begins to degrade

1363
00:43:48,159 --> 00:43:52,159
just breaks breaks down and so what

1364
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:53,440
actually that does is

1365
00:43:52,159 --> 00:43:55,199
there's actually some of those bright

1366
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:56,720
colors that we see beneath like the

1367
00:43:55,199 --> 00:43:59,118
yellows and the golds and

1368
00:43:56,719 --> 00:44:00,480
reds are actually there much of the time

1369
00:43:59,119 --> 00:44:02,318
but they don't really show themselves

1370
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:03,920
because they're so masked by the green

1371
00:44:02,318 --> 00:44:05,599
so what happened with the warm fall like

1372
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:06,480
we had the the green color was not

1373
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:07,920
degrading

1374
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:09,760
and it and then when it as it did

1375
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:11,358
degrade it didn't allow it didn't the

1376
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:13,839
grade as fast as thoroughly

1377
00:44:11,358 --> 00:44:14,400
to to you know allow that good full

1378
00:44:13,838 --> 00:44:15,599
color

1379
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:16,960
but we had some other conditions that

1380
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:18,318
were good we had a good wet early part

1381
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:21,599
of the year so that's

1382
00:44:18,318 --> 00:44:23,519
part of a good good fall color

1383
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:25,200
but i think it was just too long and one

1384
00:44:23,519 --> 00:44:27,679
of a fall didn't allow that chlorophyll

1385
00:44:25,199 --> 00:44:27,679
breakdown

1386
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:31,760
for years we've been actually before

1387
00:44:30,719 --> 00:44:32,639
there was even an issue of climate

1388
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:35,520
change

1389
00:44:32,639 --> 00:44:36,000
the those who monitor pests were had

1390
00:44:35,519 --> 00:44:38,880
developed

1391
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:40,400
a simple winter model that predicted how

1392
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:42,800
bad the flea beetles would be basically

1393
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:44,559
based on how cold they got in the winter

1394
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:46,720
and like i said you know the models all

1395
00:44:44,559 --> 00:44:49,440
show basically most winters now

1396
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:51,838
we show more populations than we used to

1397
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:51,838
have so

1398
00:44:55,199 --> 00:44:58,799
uh well the allergen so luzisk has done

1399
00:44:57,199 --> 00:44:59,358
the work on this and published this and

1400
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:00,880
the

1401
00:44:59,358 --> 00:45:02,639
allergenic part is really hard to

1402
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:04,400
understand um

1403
00:45:02,639 --> 00:45:06,400
certainly the uh like i said the weed

1404
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:08,559
growth itself is stimulated and

1405
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:09,519
it turns out that in a if we were to

1406
00:45:08,559 --> 00:45:11,679
generalize

1407
00:45:09,519 --> 00:45:13,199
plant what happens is plants so they're

1408
00:45:11,679 --> 00:45:14,719
exposed to more co2 so they

1409
00:45:13,199 --> 00:45:16,078
photosynthesize more they get more

1410
00:45:14,719 --> 00:45:18,559
sugars in the leaves

1411
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:20,400
but some plants can't find places to put

1412
00:45:18,559 --> 00:45:22,239
that sugar fast enough

1413
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:23,760
to keep up with the benefit but those

1414
00:45:22,239 --> 00:45:24,639
plants that are really viney and fast

1415
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:27,280
growing

1416
00:45:24,639 --> 00:45:28,239
they find you know they keep spreading

1417
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:30,000
same thing like with

1418
00:45:28,239 --> 00:45:31,679
an indeterminate tomato versus a

1419
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,079
determinate tomato indeterminate would

1420
00:45:31,679 --> 00:45:34,159
benefit

1421
00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:35,760
more from co2 so these weeds benefit

1422
00:45:34,159 --> 00:45:37,279
more but the um

1423
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:38,800
the idea of the allergenic thing is

1424
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:39,680
still poorly understood because it's

1425
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:41,119
actually it's not

1426
00:45:39,679 --> 00:45:43,440
you know it's it's not just that there's

1427
00:45:41,119 --> 00:45:45,680
more plant there with more allergen

1428
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:47,440
uh it's really you know per unit leaf

1429
00:45:45,679 --> 00:45:50,559
area there's it's more potent

1430
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:50,559
and it's not well understood

1431
00:45:52,719 --> 00:45:56,559
well you know it's it's funny it's like

1432
00:45:55,039 --> 00:45:57,838
it's harder to predict what's going to

1433
00:45:56,559 --> 00:45:59,039
happen this winter than it is what's

1434
00:45:57,838 --> 00:46:00,318
going to happen in the long term it's

1435
00:45:59,039 --> 00:46:03,199
sort of like

1436
00:46:00,318 --> 00:46:04,960
you know trying to like looking spending

1437
00:46:03,199 --> 00:46:06,318
one day in the stock market and looking

1438
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:07,519
at the ups and downs all day and trying

1439
00:46:06,318 --> 00:46:08,159
to figure out what's that going to do to

1440
00:46:07,519 --> 00:46:09,519
the economy

1441
00:46:08,159 --> 00:46:10,960
what's the economy even like 10 years

1442
00:46:09,519 --> 00:46:11,679
from now it's actually easier to predict

1443
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:13,119
that

1444
00:46:11,679 --> 00:46:15,118
the stock market will probably be up 10

1445
00:46:13,119 --> 00:46:16,160
years from now but to try to figure out

1446
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:17,039
what's going to be an hour from now it's

1447
00:46:16,159 --> 00:46:19,519
hard to reject

1448
00:46:17,039 --> 00:46:21,039
so this winter you know i think um i

1449
00:46:19,519 --> 00:46:22,960
really don't know the answer because

1450
00:46:21,039 --> 00:46:24,239
i don't really study that that's more

1451
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:26,639
like a weather issue

1452
00:46:24,239 --> 00:46:28,719
and a meteorology issue and art degatano

1453
00:46:26,639 --> 00:46:29,279
at cornell is someone who really tracks

1454
00:46:28,719 --> 00:46:31,118
it more

1455
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:32,400
there's a way of getting a handle at

1456
00:46:31,119 --> 00:46:33,119
least a rough handle on just what it

1457
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:34,559
might be

1458
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:35,838
based on what's happening in other parts

1459
00:46:34,559 --> 00:46:36,639
of the globe with the jet stream

1460
00:46:35,838 --> 00:46:37,838
patterns

1461
00:46:36,639 --> 00:46:40,400
and what's happening with ocean

1462
00:46:37,838 --> 00:46:42,000
temperatures that affect when

1463
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:44,318
when for example we get these arctic

1464
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:45,039
blasts and so they can look at something

1465
00:46:44,318 --> 00:46:46,318
now

1466
00:46:45,039 --> 00:46:47,599
in terms of things that might be

1467
00:46:46,318 --> 00:46:48,239
happening in the north atlantic or

1468
00:46:47,599 --> 00:46:51,280
whatever

1469
00:46:48,239 --> 00:46:52,239
and get some idea what kind of um winter

1470
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:53,760
we're supposed to have

1471
00:46:52,239 --> 00:46:54,879
and i have heard the same thing that

1472
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:56,240
we're you know we should could have a

1473
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:58,160
colder winter this year

1474
00:46:56,239 --> 00:46:59,199
and i assume it's it goes back to some

1475
00:46:58,159 --> 00:46:59,838
of the meteorologists who've been

1476
00:46:59,199 --> 00:47:01,919
looking

1477
00:46:59,838 --> 00:47:02,880
at those trends we actually are because

1478
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:05,119
i think it's becoming

1479
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:07,838
just more variable though and harder for

1480
00:47:05,119 --> 00:47:11,039
everybody to predict and so there's more

1481
00:47:07,838 --> 00:47:13,679
um more work going on in uh

1482
00:47:11,039 --> 00:47:14,480
in in the area of meteorology to try to

1483
00:47:13,679 --> 00:47:17,118
develop better

1484
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:18,480
better forecasting systems because every

1485
00:47:17,119 --> 00:47:19,358
it's not so much that we're just seeing

1486
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:22,240
warmer

1487
00:47:19,358 --> 00:47:22,799
this and that it's that basically we're

1488
00:47:22,239 --> 00:47:25,838
seeing

1489
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:27,760
um you know um

1490
00:47:25,838 --> 00:47:29,279
you know climate weirding is what some

1491
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:32,160
people say i mean just

1492
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:33,760
you know it's um it's just getting

1493
00:47:32,159 --> 00:47:35,759
harder and harder to predict so

1494
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:37,200
a lot of farmers say it's just that one

1495
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:38,000
in ten years we used to have something

1496
00:47:37,199 --> 00:47:39,679
we had never seen

1497
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,838
on the farm before and now it's one in

1498
00:47:39,679 --> 00:47:43,358
three years and it's not always that

1499
00:47:41,838 --> 00:47:44,880
it's hotter it's that

1500
00:47:43,358 --> 00:47:46,318
it's the coldest winter and now it's the

1501
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:47,519
wettest summer and now it's the driest

1502
00:47:46,318 --> 00:47:49,440
summer and

1503
00:47:47,519 --> 00:47:51,119
so uh and that's i think partly because

1504
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:52,159
it's not as simple as we once thought i

1505
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:54,400
mean there's things like these jet

1506
00:47:52,159 --> 00:47:57,199
stream patterns being affected and

1507
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:57,200
and all that so

1508
00:47:59,679 --> 00:48:03,279
well you know i think you know it's hard

1509
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:04,960
to attribute you know single

1510
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:06,559
weather events and stuff to climate

1511
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:08,559
change i would say for example

1512
00:48:06,559 --> 00:48:09,680
that you know more you know as i

1513
00:48:08,559 --> 00:48:11,440
mentioned there is this

1514
00:48:09,679 --> 00:48:13,279
a real something we can attribute to

1515
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:14,800
climate change is more heavy rains that

1516
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:16,559
can cause some short-term flooding which

1517
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:18,880
could be enough to do some root damage

1518
00:48:16,559 --> 00:48:20,160
which could slow down plants for example

1519
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:22,240
uh so there could have been

1520
00:48:20,159 --> 00:48:23,358
something like that yeah yeah i don't so

1521
00:48:22,239 --> 00:48:23,919
the question is what happened with kind

1522
00:48:23,358 --> 00:48:26,719
of like

1523
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:27,599
stunted growth as we uh after the rains

1524
00:48:26,719 --> 00:48:29,519
in late summer

1525
00:48:27,599 --> 00:48:31,039
and then we saw this long kind of a fall

1526
00:48:29,519 --> 00:48:31,519
that was pretty warm and things weren't

1527
00:48:31,039 --> 00:48:32,880
growing

1528
00:48:31,519 --> 00:48:35,838
yeah i don't really know don't really

1529
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:35,838
know

1530
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:46,400
this has been a production of cornell

1531
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:52,880
university

1532
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:52,880
