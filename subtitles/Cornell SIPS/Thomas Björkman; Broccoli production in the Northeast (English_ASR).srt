1
00:00:01,159 --> 00:00:04,799
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:12,919
University so I'm going to talk today

3
00:00:10,519 --> 00:00:15,400
run through fairly quickly a whole bunch

4
00:00:12,919 --> 00:00:17,240
of different directions uh the

5
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:18,920
introduction said I've investigated

6
00:00:17,239 --> 00:00:21,038
numerous angles and so you're going to

7
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:24,720
see a little bit of a lot of different

8
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:26,240
angles in this talk um so broccoli

9
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:28,599
production in the northeast of course

10
00:00:26,239 --> 00:00:32,479
I'm betraying my California upbringing

11
00:00:28,599 --> 00:00:34,799
and pursuing this topic at all um but it

12
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:36,878
turns out to be uh a really interesting

13
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:39,238
one with a lot of potential in various

14
00:00:36,878 --> 00:00:40,960
different directions so why would one

15
00:00:39,238 --> 00:00:43,640
care about broccoli production in the

16
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:46,160
Northeast so we've got a number of

17
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:48,640
different things happening right now

18
00:00:46,159 --> 00:00:50,959
that kind of makes this a compelling

19
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:53,079
thing to pursue so I think you're all

20
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,799
aware that locally grown is a big deal

21
00:00:53,079 --> 00:00:56,960
everybody's talking about locally grown

22
00:00:54,799 --> 00:00:58,279
produce as being something attractive

23
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:02,679
and that is showing up in the

24
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:05,640
marketplace as uh the supermarkets and

25
00:01:02,679 --> 00:01:07,640
wholesalers are starting to think about

26
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:09,320
how can I get local product into my

27
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:11,599
store where can I Source it who can I

28
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:14,959
buy it from

29
00:01:11,599 --> 00:01:16,719
uh We've despite the lower diesel prices

30
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:18,599
this year for the past several years

31
00:01:16,719 --> 00:01:21,200
diesel has been very expensive that's

32
00:01:18,599 --> 00:01:24,519
made transportation from California very

33
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:26,118
expensive in fact the wholesale price of

34
00:01:24,519 --> 00:01:28,399
broccoli and much other produce on the

35
00:01:26,118 --> 00:01:30,159
East Coast half of that cost is the

36
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:33,439
transportation and half of it is the

37
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:35,159
cost that was paid in California uh that

38
00:01:33,438 --> 00:01:37,000
cost has not come down with the diesel

39
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:39,560
price by the way it's still the same

40
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,920
high price so that's a barrier that

41
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:45,600
provides an opportunity uh to make money

42
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:48,000
for Growers um we're looking at reducing

43
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:51,199
the carbon footprint so

44
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,399
shipping uh 10,000 lbs of broccoli and

45
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,439
10,000 lbs of ice across the country has

46
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:58,159
a substantial footprint not only with

47
00:01:55,438 --> 00:02:02,359
the diesel but the Ice uh we can reduce

48
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:04,880
that our uh vegetable Growers uh value

49
00:02:02,359 --> 00:02:06,799
diversification on their Farms value

50
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:08,799
diversification on what they're selling

51
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:12,920
so both in the rotation and economically

52
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:15,000
diversification is good uh and also as

53
00:02:12,919 --> 00:02:17,679
we've noticed with the shortage of water

54
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,560
in California this year that having our

55
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:23,280
production Diversified around the

56
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:26,400
country can help provide we're calling

57
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:28,640
it food security for the United States

58
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,879
that we don't fall short of crops that

59
00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:32,839
we really like during periods when the

60
00:02:30,878 --> 00:02:34,199
one location that it's grown something's

61
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:35,959
happening there that prevents us from

62
00:02:34,199 --> 00:02:38,679
getting it so there's a number of angles

63
00:02:35,959 --> 00:02:41,319
to why we would want to uh be looking at

64
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:43,640
broccoli in the Northeast right now why

65
00:02:41,318 --> 00:02:45,878
broccoli people love broccoli who ate

66
00:02:43,639 --> 00:02:48,439
broccoli in the last

67
00:02:45,878 --> 00:02:50,158
month yeah how about the last week we've

68
00:02:48,439 --> 00:02:53,000
probably got some Vegeta look at that

69
00:02:50,158 --> 00:02:56,079
yeah so everybody eats broccoli just

70
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:00,080
about right it's a very very popular

71
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:01,800
crop and so this this chart shows how

72
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,360
the broccoli consumption per capita has

73
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:06,400
been going up of course the population's

74
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:10,200
going up too uh the interesting thing to

75
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:12,760
me is down here at 1970 we're about half

76
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:16,238
a pound per person a year that's not

77
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:19,399
very much it was an Italian special to e

78
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:21,920
vegetable pretty much in the 1960s it

79
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:26,519
really only became sort of something

80
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:29,839
everybody ate relatively recently and um

81
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:31,840
so there there's a big upside for for

82
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,799
kale by the way it's a half now after

83
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:35,319
the

84
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:37,080
burst in the last few years it's gone

85
00:03:35,318 --> 00:03:40,039
from a quarter to a half so it's really

86
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:42,799
gone way up but you can you can imagine

87
00:03:40,039 --> 00:03:46,438
the trajectory over the next several

88
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:48,200
years um so there's only upside

89
00:03:46,438 --> 00:03:50,359
potential so where do we grow broccoli

90
00:03:48,199 --> 00:03:53,078
now well we grow it in California of

91
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:55,720
course is the answer uh so this shows

92
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:57,879
you uh the big numbers are how many

93
00:03:55,719 --> 00:03:59,479
acres of production there are in each

94
00:03:57,878 --> 00:04:02,000
part so you see on the coast in the

95
00:03:59,479 --> 00:04:03,719
summer in the desert in the winter time

96
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,598
and a little smattering on the east

97
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:07,639
coast and when you get to the very

98
00:04:05,598 --> 00:04:11,119
northernmost County where it's good and

99
00:04:07,639 --> 00:04:12,518
cold uh there's a little patch there um

100
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:15,120
a little winter production down there

101
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:18,079
but really it's a little smattering and

102
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:20,160
in fact I think we have worked with each

103
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:23,478
of the Farms that represents a dot in

104
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:26,080
this map uh so there's there's potential

105
00:04:23,478 --> 00:04:29,519
for increasing that on the on the East

106
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:31,800
Coast uh so why can't we do that simply

107
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:34,198
well first of all the varieties that

108
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:37,240
exist are poorly adapted to our Eastern

109
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:40,439
growing conditions temperature water

110
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:43,000
humidity are and variability in all of

111
00:04:40,439 --> 00:04:45,959
the above are really big challenges and

112
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,918
so what's been done to date is to raise

113
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:49,839
broccoli where the conditions are

114
00:04:47,918 --> 00:04:53,359
optimal for it and that has worked but

115
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:55,279
as demand goes up we need to find more

116
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,919
places uh the

117
00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:59,679
other significant obstacle is that for

118
00:04:57,918 --> 00:05:01,758
any one location we have a Rel

119
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:03,918
relatively short harvest season so here

120
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:05,879
it would basically be September right

121
00:05:03,918 --> 00:05:08,839
now you can grow broccoli just fine if

122
00:05:05,879 --> 00:05:10,918
you harvest in September the problem is

123
00:05:08,839 --> 00:05:12,599
that your customers need broccoli 12

124
00:05:10,918 --> 00:05:15,839
months out of the year and they're not

125
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:18,479
going to abandon their reliable supplier

126
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:21,679
for a month to take your stuff that's

127
00:05:18,478 --> 00:05:24,399
the Grower's dilemma so supplying year

128
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:27,319
round turns out to be a very important

129
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:31,198
uh element of getting into the

130
00:05:27,319 --> 00:05:33,520
market and because of that situation the

131
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:36,840
distribution Network for Growers

132
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:39,918
throughout the East is not really set up

133
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:42,839
to handle a product uh with a fresh

134
00:05:39,918 --> 00:05:45,318
market product with this volume so just

135
00:05:42,839 --> 00:05:48,519
getting it from The Producers to the

136
00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:51,520
stores the very common question from

137
00:05:48,519 --> 00:05:54,758
Farmers I can grow it just fine but who

138
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:59,279
do I sell it to very common question

139
00:05:54,759 --> 00:06:01,720
from retail produce uh buyers we really

140
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:04,638
want local broccoli but we can't find

141
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:06,440
anybody to raise it for us so this seems

142
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:08,720
like a dilemma that can be overcome and

143
00:06:06,439 --> 00:06:12,199
it turns out this distribution network

144
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:15,960
is the problem so where do we start

145
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:17,360
well of course start with breeding and

146
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:19,079
improving the crop because that's what

147
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:22,479
we're really good at and I'll talk in

148
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:25,680
more detail about that uh but breeding a

149
00:06:22,478 --> 00:06:27,560
better crop doesn't help unless the

150
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:29,000
farmers can buy the Seed of it right

151
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:32,240
that's where the rubber meets the road

152
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:35,240
you can buy the seed if there's only

153
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:37,598
6,000 Acres of broccoli in the East the

154
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:39,199
seed companies don't care they're not

155
00:06:37,598 --> 00:06:41,000
going to spend money on developing

156
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:43,199
varieties marketing them releasing them

157
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,319
raising seed and selling those seed if

158
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:47,199
there's only a few Growers so they

159
00:06:45,319 --> 00:06:49,598
haven't been motivated to do anything at

160
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:53,598
all that's been a big

161
00:06:49,598 --> 00:06:56,439
obstacle so we've tried to put together

162
00:06:53,598 --> 00:06:59,079
a project where we contempt them with

163
00:06:56,439 --> 00:07:01,639
the promise of having a lot more acreage

164
00:06:59,079 --> 00:07:04,519
in the east so it's worth their while

165
00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:07,160
and so This Promise of volume markets

166
00:07:04,519 --> 00:07:09,079
has developed the promise of potentially

167
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:11,759
having a lot more Eastern Growers more

168
00:07:09,079 --> 00:07:14,038
seed sales and Seed Company

169
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:17,759
interest and so just to show you what

170
00:07:14,038 --> 00:07:20,918
the what the problem looks like uh with

171
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:23,280
warm nights not enough chilling hours to

172
00:07:20,918 --> 00:07:25,318
put it roughly for those of you who've

173
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:28,399
taken plant physiology and recognize

174
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:30,319
that system so the flower buds need cool

175
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:32,679
temperatures to decide to develop and

176
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:34,479
obviously that didn't happen uh at the

177
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:37,079
right time in this one and so you have

178
00:07:34,478 --> 00:07:39,719
some very teeny tiny floral primordia

179
00:07:37,079 --> 00:07:41,598
there and some big flower buds there

180
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:43,639
that managed to squeak through while it

181
00:07:41,598 --> 00:07:45,478
was still cool uh so that's what a

182
00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:48,199
western adapted variety looks like here

183
00:07:45,478 --> 00:07:52,918
in the summertime this is a variety that

184
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:55,439
was bred for growing in warmer summer

185
00:07:52,918 --> 00:07:57,478
conditions probably nobody would buy

186
00:07:55,439 --> 00:08:00,519
this unless it was a friend who was

187
00:07:57,478 --> 00:08:03,839
selling it to you right uh

188
00:08:00,519 --> 00:08:06,279
and this is Pac-Man this is the variety

189
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:08,878
that Eastern broccoli production was

190
00:08:06,279 --> 00:08:12,439
based on for about 20 years until maybe

191
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:14,639
five or 10 years ago uh it still looks

192
00:08:12,439 --> 00:08:16,879
pretty rough you can sell that in some

193
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:18,840
markets but certainly not in the

194
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:21,720
supermarket trade or the restaurant

195
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:25,679
trade so we need to have varieties that

196
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:27,520
look better than that so that's our the

197
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,800
physiological goal and the breeding goal

198
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:32,918
of the project so I want to run through

199
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:35,158
really quickly some of uh the physiology

200
00:08:32,918 --> 00:08:38,000
we did a number of years ago because in

201
00:08:35,158 --> 00:08:39,718
case you've forgotten or are not yet

202
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,360
aware uh because we're going to be

203
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:46,320
picking up on on this uh soon so in

204
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:48,959
development you have vegetative marem

205
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:51,839
you recognize a little Dome on top there

206
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:54,639
uh at a certain point the flowering

207
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:56,360
reproductive transition comes along and

208
00:08:54,639 --> 00:08:58,838
so now you have a reproductive Marist

209
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:01,440
stem you can tell the difference the

210
00:08:58,839 --> 00:09:01,440
main difference

211
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:02,600
floral primordia just show you you can

212
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,559
get a good siiz head consisting of

213
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:08,079
nothing but floral primordia AR rested

214
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:11,159
in development um the inset shows them a

215
00:10:08,078 --> 00:10:13,919
little bit bigger and there's the it's

216
00:10:11,159 --> 00:10:15,199
gone all the way to flower buds uh so

217
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:17,278
you may ask what's the genetic

218
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,680
difference between these because you

219
00:10:17,278 --> 00:10:20,919
know if we had the gene we could solve

220
00:10:18,679 --> 00:10:22,919
it well all three of those pictures are

221
00:10:20,919 --> 00:10:25,919
taken from exactly the same

222
00:10:22,919 --> 00:10:27,679
genotype it's an F1 hybrid commercial

223
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:30,439
green cauliflower variety called Green

224
00:10:27,679 --> 00:10:32,399
Harmony it's widely raised in Asia it's

225
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:34,920
an F1 hybrid they're all the same the

226
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:37,159
difference is the temperature so it's

227
00:10:34,919 --> 00:10:40,199
gene expression is very important what

228
00:10:37,159 --> 00:10:46,319
triggers gene expression after a certain

229
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:49,079
number of U chilling hours are uh

230
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:52,839
accumulated so we'll take a quick look

231
00:10:49,078 --> 00:10:54,879
at that so leafy is a gene that usually

232
00:10:52,839 --> 00:10:56,760
if it turns on that's when you start

233
00:10:54,879 --> 00:10:59,679
getting the floral differentiation and

234
00:10:56,759 --> 00:11:01,278
here you can see a vegetative marem so

235
00:10:59,679 --> 00:11:03,359
the white speckles are where the gene is

236
00:11:01,278 --> 00:11:06,278
being expressed so it's low in the

237
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:09,800
vegetative one starts to get higher

238
00:11:06,278 --> 00:11:12,078
right in the outside surface of those uh

239
00:11:09,799 --> 00:11:14,759
reproductive meristems and then when it

240
00:11:12,078 --> 00:11:17,439
goes to flower buds uh it actually looks

241
00:11:14,759 --> 00:11:19,600
a little bit lower which it stays high

242
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:21,720
at that point in a arabidopsis it's a

243
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:24,959
little different so Denise Duo is a

244
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:28,079
graduate student here um who looked at a

245
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:31,599
whole set of candidate genes that we

246
00:11:28,078 --> 00:11:34,479
believed from arabidopsis work uh would

247
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:38,800
tell us where the level of control was

248
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:40,759
and we found many genes that didn't do

249
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:43,120
anything interesting at all even though

250
00:11:40,759 --> 00:11:48,000
we expected them to uh but there were a

251
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:53,039
couple so leafy when the transition from

252
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:55,039
the U floral primordia to the flowers uh

253
00:11:53,039 --> 00:11:57,679
the leafy drops off and when you have

254
00:11:55,039 --> 00:11:59,919
the earlier transition we see that the a

255
00:11:57,679 --> 00:12:04,679
pedala one which is the petal

256
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:06,679
designating uh Gene turns on uh so we

257
00:12:04,679 --> 00:12:09,838
have a couple of transitions so the

258
00:12:06,679 --> 00:12:13,000
question is what leads up to that and so

259
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:16,639
we compared as development proceeds or

260
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:19,198
the expression levels of uh so we see

261
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:20,879
leafy stops at this one and AP1 turns

262
00:12:19,198 --> 00:12:23,039
off there have another one called

263
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:27,120
fruitful that was doing some interesting

264
00:12:23,039 --> 00:12:29,599
things uh so to go to the next step

265
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:32,480
we're asking what regulates these but

266
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:33,720
when you compare broccoli with what's

267
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:36,240
going on in

268
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:38,000
arabidopsis we were not encouraged to

269
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,480
say Well it happens this way in a rabid

270
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,440
offis so therefore it must be happening

271
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:44,000
the same way in broccoli they're just

272
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:46,720
not being expressed at the same stages

273
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:49,839
and it's a very complex network uh that

274
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:52,320
leads up to that and we ended up having

275
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:54,600
uh a very large number of candidate

276
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:58,399
genes to try to pursue a candidate Gene

277
00:12:54,600 --> 00:13:01,839
approach so that effort more or less

278
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:04,919
stopped at that point and the uh given

279
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:06,839
the situation the next step is really to

280
00:13:04,919 --> 00:13:09,559
pick it up at the genomics level where

281
00:13:06,839 --> 00:13:11,800
you can look at all of the genes you

282
00:13:09,559 --> 00:13:14,078
don't have to know in advance uh and

283
00:13:11,799 --> 00:13:16,519
look at what that variation is so that

284
00:13:14,078 --> 00:13:18,359
is a direction that Zach stanel will be

285
00:13:16,519 --> 00:13:20,919
pursuing here if he went to grad review

286
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:24,320
you saw some of the populations that he

287
00:13:20,919 --> 00:13:26,838
has available uh to him to begin that so

288
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:29,920
that'll be continuing

289
00:13:26,839 --> 00:13:34,120
onward um but then we come to the

290
00:13:29,919 --> 00:13:37,439
Eastern broccoli project which funded no

291
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:39,519
molecular work whatsoever uh but many

292
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:41,079
other things so this is a project that

293
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:44,839
was funded by the specialty crops

294
00:13:41,078 --> 00:13:46,399
research initiative uh and it had a goal

295
00:13:44,839 --> 00:13:50,079
of having year- round broccoli

296
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:50,078
production of a quality that consumers

297
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:56,160
want and so here are sort of the Harvest

298
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:58,440
Seasons starting in Maine New York going

299
00:13:56,159 --> 00:14:02,240
south we've got the mountains of Ken

300
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:04,399
Tennessee Kent and Virginia uh South

301
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:06,519
Carolina North Carolina and then uh

302
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:07,879
South Georgia and Florida are sort of

303
00:14:06,519 --> 00:14:10,440
the different production areas we're

304
00:14:07,879 --> 00:14:12,120
looking at and the harvest season in

305
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:15,920
each of those and one of the things you

306
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:17,679
can see is that there is gaps even when

307
00:14:15,919 --> 00:14:20,159
we've got all the production areas going

308
00:14:17,679 --> 00:14:22,958
there are still gaps in the production

309
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:24,600
season and so the goal is to expand each

310
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:27,719
of those production Seasons by

311
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:30,079
increasing the environmental uh adapt

312
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:31,879
adaptation of the broccoli so that we

313
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:33,399
can go wider and have them overlap a

314
00:14:31,879 --> 00:14:39,198
little

315
00:14:33,399 --> 00:14:39,198
bit so to realize the opport

316
00:14:40,519 --> 00:14:45,759
the

317
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,759
well the

318
00:14:46,159 --> 00:14:52,439
oper I guess to find the yearround

319
00:14:50,159 --> 00:14:54,759
production uh we need not only the

320
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:58,160
varieties that have the right traits we

321
00:14:54,759 --> 00:15:01,320
need the uh really wide adaptability so

322
00:14:58,159 --> 00:15:03,120
that's a trait of sorts but uh it's

323
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:06,120
really a fundamental behavior of the

324
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:08,360
plant uh we need to get the varieties

325
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:10,320
released the seed companies need to be

326
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:13,320
producing the seeds selling the seeds of

327
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:17,399
them uh we need a grower base that can

328
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:21,240
expand so people are expert at growing

329
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:22,919
vegetables uh but not currently doing

330
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:24,600
broccoli how can they start doing

331
00:15:22,919 --> 00:15:26,439
broccoli where does that make sense for

332
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:29,879
them

333
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:32,240
um and looking at the Supply so that

334
00:15:29,879 --> 00:15:34,439
we're having enough broccoli coming on

335
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:36,560
the market to meet the demand but not so

336
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:38,680
much that it depresses the price and

337
00:15:36,559 --> 00:15:40,599
finding that balance is actually not

338
00:15:38,679 --> 00:15:43,120
only challenging but very location

339
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:44,879
specific you can tank the price in one

340
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:47,879
market and have a shortage in another

341
00:15:44,879 --> 00:15:50,240
one just a few hundred miles away uh and

342
00:15:47,879 --> 00:15:52,639
then finally make sure that the the

343
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:57,240
product that's raised in the East is

344
00:15:52,639 --> 00:16:00,120
valued by the consumers uh and by the

345
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:01,480
uh really the produ ju managers they're

346
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:06,039
real

347
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:09,120
U uh roadblock in this one so we set up

348
00:16:06,039 --> 00:16:12,159
uh a set of six objectives in the

349
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:14,679
project uh to try to hit all of those

350
00:16:12,159 --> 00:16:17,958
and I'll talk a little bit about most of

351
00:16:14,679 --> 00:16:20,758
them and so you may not even be able to

352
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:23,559
read that but this is uh some of the

353
00:16:20,759 --> 00:16:25,959
team that was working together and so we

354
00:16:23,559 --> 00:16:28,638
had a breeding group

355
00:16:25,958 --> 00:16:30,318
um nutritional quality we don't want to

356
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:33,720
have the broccoli be less healthy that

357
00:16:30,318 --> 00:16:36,958
would be rude uh the big Regional trial

358
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:41,759
system in many locations we looking at

359
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:45,159
uh economics uh both National Market

360
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:48,000
systems and consumer decision making uh

361
00:16:45,159 --> 00:16:49,879
we have a team from the seed companies

362
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,399
who are responsible for

363
00:16:49,879 --> 00:16:54,679
commercialization uh a number of

364
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:57,318
different Farms an extension team to

365
00:16:54,679 --> 00:16:59,679
make sure that the uh Growers had

366
00:16:57,318 --> 00:17:01,519
appropriate guidance and and then a

367
00:16:59,679 --> 00:17:04,240
bunch of distribution and Retail it

368
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:06,599
turns out it's it's not like this one

369
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:08,078
big flow of broccoli there's hundreds of

370
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:10,759
different markets all with their own

371
00:17:08,078 --> 00:17:12,480
expectations so we try to uh represent a

372
00:17:10,759 --> 00:17:15,359
lot of those and so a lot of integration

373
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:17,640
with industry in this project so looking

374
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:20,759
at the breeding element of it so we want

375
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:22,400
to improve the public sector germ plasm

376
00:17:20,759 --> 00:17:24,879
the in the public sector there's a lot

377
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:26,559
of opportunity to make improvements that

378
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:29,960
don't make sense for the

379
00:17:26,558 --> 00:17:32,558
companies uh especially bringing in in

380
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:35,079
uh more unusual traits or starting with

381
00:17:32,558 --> 00:17:38,200
uh material that's a little bit more odd

382
00:17:35,079 --> 00:17:40,119
than commercial material uh we also want

383
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:42,120
to discover the best seed company

384
00:17:40,119 --> 00:17:43,678
germplasm they've got lots of packets of

385
00:17:42,119 --> 00:17:45,359
seeds sashed away that didn't have

386
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:48,720
enough market potential before but maybe

387
00:17:45,359 --> 00:17:50,599
it does now let's find it uh want to

388
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:53,640
combine the excellent traits that are in

389
00:17:50,599 --> 00:17:56,519
the commercial germplasm with the new

390
00:17:53,640 --> 00:18:00,120
traits that would come out of a public

391
00:17:56,519 --> 00:18:03,119
program um

392
00:18:00,119 --> 00:18:05,439
we want to understand the quantitative

393
00:18:03,119 --> 00:18:07,479
genetics of the traits these are

394
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:09,798
difficult traits in understanding how

395
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:13,240
they behave and interact uh is important

396
00:18:09,798 --> 00:18:18,720
for making progress uh nicking trials

397
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:20,720
for hybrid production uh not all couples

398
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:23,360
are made in heaven when it comes to

399
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:24,919
broccoli so some of them are very

400
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:26,558
productive of seeds some are not if

401
00:18:24,919 --> 00:18:29,799
you're a seed company seeds are your

402
00:18:26,558 --> 00:18:31,279
products so if you have a hybrid that

403
00:18:29,798 --> 00:18:33,158
you want to sell in the plant it just

404
00:18:31,279 --> 00:18:34,879
doesn't make a lot of seeds well that's

405
00:18:33,159 --> 00:18:37,520
that's low productivity that's a really

406
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:39,720
big problem so it turns out that the

407
00:18:37,519 --> 00:18:44,119
hybrids you see on the market are from

408
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:47,279
very fun uh parental pairs so we have

409
00:18:44,119 --> 00:18:52,479
three public programs so griffs is one

410
00:18:47,279 --> 00:18:55,720
of them here at Cornell U and Mark faram

411
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:57,960
with ARs at Charleston South Carolina

412
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:59,558
and uh Jim Myers at Oregon state who's

413
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:02,120
been breeding for

414
00:18:59,558 --> 00:19:04,240
uh really the processing industry as

415
00:19:02,119 --> 00:19:06,038
well as for organic production so we

416
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:08,400
wanted to bring that in and then three

417
00:19:06,038 --> 00:19:10,839
private programs the seed companies beo

418
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:14,360
senta and seminis were the ones who

419
00:19:10,839 --> 00:19:15,759
elected to join us and as the person

420
00:19:14,359 --> 00:19:18,359
trying to get all these people to talk

421
00:19:15,759 --> 00:19:20,480
to each other in common language we find

422
00:19:18,359 --> 00:19:23,719
that each of the breeding programs has a

423
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:26,720
very distinct way of going about things

424
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:29,558
uh different populations different goals

425
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:33,240
um so one of the uh

426
00:19:29,558 --> 00:19:35,200
techniques was to try to encourage them

427
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:37,839
to compete a little bit with one another

428
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:40,759
so we have a regional trial program so

429
00:19:37,839 --> 00:19:43,439
trying to make sure that everybody feels

430
00:19:40,759 --> 00:19:47,200
uh the competitive urge to have the best

431
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:49,320
material in the regional trial uh that

432
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:51,880
uh proved helpful but then at the same

433
00:19:49,319 --> 00:19:54,319
time uh we want them to collaborate with

434
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:57,520
each other to generate cross program

435
00:19:54,319 --> 00:20:00,119
results that are uh even better uh and

436
00:19:57,519 --> 00:20:02,960
then we really want want to get the

437
00:20:00,119 --> 00:20:05,839
public material licensed so that crowers

438
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:07,840
can get it uh licensing is is how it's

439
00:20:05,839 --> 00:20:10,918
done these days but having the public

440
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:13,279
material then go to a seed company in

441
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:17,120
one of many forms

442
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:19,440
um and uh become available and provide

443
00:20:17,119 --> 00:20:20,479
Revenue to keep uh these breeding

444
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:24,558
programs

445
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:26,599
going um so they're are the Breeders I

446
00:20:24,558 --> 00:20:29,079
mentioned them so here are the traits

447
00:20:26,599 --> 00:20:32,158
that the new varieties need so you

448
00:20:29,079 --> 00:20:33,960
notice it's a long list for starters uh

449
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:37,440
I'll only mention briefly we need the

450
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:39,919
stability across environments wide

451
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:41,200
adaptation uh because in any given

452
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:42,759
location you're going to have a lot of

453
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:45,679
variation in the weather and you don't

454
00:20:42,759 --> 00:20:48,400
know how to predict it if you remember

455
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:50,200
365 days ago what kind of jacket were

456
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:55,519
you wearing and what are you wearing

457
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:58,080
today that's normal variation uh we need

458
00:20:55,519 --> 00:21:01,319
the uniform bead so that's really

459
00:20:58,079 --> 00:21:03,639
genetically chilling requirement uh we

460
00:21:01,319 --> 00:21:06,798
need a a good dome on it and that's just

461
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:08,400
so the rain falls off that's all all you

462
00:21:06,798 --> 00:21:10,158
need that for but you can have a

463
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,679
relatively flat head in California it

464
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:15,640
doesn't matter we need one that sheds

465
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:15,640
rain so it doesn't rot

466
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:22,679
uh want to make sure it has all the

467
00:21:18,558 --> 00:21:25,359
ingredients that make it healthy uh the

468
00:21:22,679 --> 00:21:27,798
market likes really small flower buds

469
00:21:25,359 --> 00:21:29,719
right now but really small flower buds

470
00:21:27,798 --> 00:21:31,759
are difficult to hide hide uneven flower

471
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:34,480
buds behind the big ones hide stuff a

472
00:21:31,759 --> 00:21:36,839
lot better uh so how much do you need

473
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:38,240
that it needs to look really green

474
00:21:36,839 --> 00:21:40,558
because people buy broccoli because it's

475
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:42,599
healthy and green is healthier right

476
00:21:40,558 --> 00:21:44,678
everybody uh works that way in their

477
00:21:42,599 --> 00:21:47,439
head and this turns out to be not just

478
00:21:44,679 --> 00:21:50,519
chlorophyll content but wax structure on

479
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:53,400
the surface what color antoin so there's

480
00:21:50,519 --> 00:21:55,879
a lot that goes into the uh green so all

481
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:58,759
of these are complex traits there's not

482
00:21:55,880 --> 00:22:00,320
a single Gene trait in the bunch so if

483
00:21:58,759 --> 00:22:06,720
figuring out how to pile all these

484
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:09,079
together U is no small matter U and to

485
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:11,640
really address the the first one in

486
00:22:09,079 --> 00:22:12,839
particular we've set up a system of

487
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:15,919
regional

488
00:22:12,839 --> 00:22:17,558
trials where we are testing the material

489
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:20,440
in very different locations so we want

490
00:22:17,558 --> 00:22:24,200
to identify the wide adaptation to the

491
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:25,919
east uh we want to collect a data set

492
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:27,880
where we can start to understand the

493
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:30,919
genetic control of some of these traits

494
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:33,039
there's huge environmental effect on

495
00:22:30,919 --> 00:22:35,120
essentially all of them and there's a

496
00:22:33,038 --> 00:22:37,440
substantial genotype by environment

497
00:22:35,119 --> 00:22:41,839
interaction so to figure out anything at

498
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:42,960
all you need massive data sets um we

499
00:22:41,839 --> 00:22:45,079
particularly want to understand the

500
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:47,519
variation in nutritional quality because

501
00:22:45,079 --> 00:22:48,918
that's that's again a feature people

502
00:22:47,519 --> 00:22:52,759
like we do see quite a lot of

503
00:22:48,919 --> 00:22:55,600
environmental variation um you see the

504
00:22:52,759 --> 00:22:59,879
Bena Forte broccoli it's being sold as

505
00:22:55,599 --> 00:23:01,519
uh U glucoraphanin and enhanced broccoli

506
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:03,440
type and they don't tell you what

507
00:23:01,519 --> 00:23:05,480
concentration it is because it varies

508
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:07,519
quite a lot with the growing conditions

509
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:09,558
they say it contains four times as much

510
00:23:07,519 --> 00:23:11,200
as normal broccoli and that's entirely

511
00:23:09,558 --> 00:23:13,399
true if you grow a regular variety and

512
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:15,960
benfor next to each other the benfor

513
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:18,640
generally runs about four times as high

514
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:20,319
but how much the absolute number uh

515
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:23,440
depends on the environment so we've got

516
00:23:20,319 --> 00:23:26,038
a lot of variation there

517
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:27,880
um we're trying to identify where

518
00:23:26,038 --> 00:23:29,640
different germ plasm has complimentary

519
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:31,080
traits so you get one with a great Dome

520
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:33,440
and one that's really green but you're

521
00:23:31,079 --> 00:23:35,639
not getting any that have both for

522
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:38,558
instance and

523
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:40,640
um and we want the companies to buy and

524
00:23:38,558 --> 00:23:44,038
license the public sector

525
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:46,120
material U so the these Regional trials

526
00:23:44,038 --> 00:23:47,798
they were set up in three phases the

527
00:23:46,119 --> 00:23:49,359
first one we allow lots and lots of

528
00:23:47,798 --> 00:23:52,639
entries we're essentially culling at

529
00:23:49,359 --> 00:23:54,639
that stage we've got five locations two

530
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:58,038
plantings at each location so lots of

531
00:23:54,640 --> 00:24:00,640
observations on those um but not a huge

532
00:23:58,038 --> 00:24:02,240
investment in them uh so that's an

533
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:06,159
effective culling step and that's where

534
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:08,200
we can attract uh so anything a breeder

535
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:10,200
thinks might look interesting it doesn't

536
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:12,679
have to win it just needs a chance to

537
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:15,720
win then we have a much more elaborate

538
00:24:12,679 --> 00:24:18,240
stability trial here we have uh five

539
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:20,319
plantings at four locations but that way

540
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:22,679
we try many different times during the

541
00:24:20,319 --> 00:24:26,359
season uh and really get a sense of how

542
00:24:22,679 --> 00:24:28,200
it behaves we get vast variation in what

543
00:24:26,359 --> 00:24:30,879
happens we try to hit a stressful time

544
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:32,840
and non-stressful time and sometimes

545
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:35,799
nature cooperates this is also where we

546
00:24:32,839 --> 00:24:37,720
look at the nutritional studies um and

547
00:24:35,798 --> 00:24:39,519
finally we go to looking at commercial

548
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:41,839
yields where we're on grower Farms

549
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:43,918
seeing how they uh how they actually

550
00:24:41,839 --> 00:24:46,959
behave what kind of yield are they are

551
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:48,520
they going to make money uh you know

552
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:50,000
that how much does it cost to harvest

553
00:24:48,519 --> 00:24:52,440
them do you have to go in three times or

554
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:55,159
seven times that makes a big difference

555
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:57,880
uh we spent a lot of time standardizing

556
00:24:55,159 --> 00:25:00,000
across locations so we had little

557
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:02,399
diagram for how to score different

558
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,919
things uh we got together and made sure

559
00:25:02,398 --> 00:25:05,639
everybody sat in the same room and

560
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:07,480
looked at broccoli head oh is this a

561
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:10,960
three for green or a for for green

562
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:12,798
talked about that for a long time uh to

563
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:14,759
make sure that everybody was scoring the

564
00:25:12,798 --> 00:25:17,319
same way at each location because we're

565
00:25:14,759 --> 00:25:20,038
trying to compare numbers across

566
00:25:17,319 --> 00:25:22,918
location so having that be standardized

567
00:25:20,038 --> 00:25:25,038
was really important so some of the

568
00:25:22,919 --> 00:25:28,799
stuff that comes out of it just a little

569
00:25:25,038 --> 00:25:31,278
Glimpse we can do uh this this is an

570
00:25:28,798 --> 00:25:35,519
Association uh among the different

571
00:25:31,278 --> 00:25:39,759
traits that we scored uh and so each of

572
00:25:35,519 --> 00:25:43,119
this are a scatter plot of

573
00:25:39,759 --> 00:25:44,960
um how the two traits are related to

574
00:25:43,119 --> 00:25:46,959
each other so here's an example of

575
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:49,278
firmness and bead size usually smaller

576
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:52,360
flower buds make the head firmer and it

577
00:25:49,278 --> 00:25:54,720
is sturdier and you can see that there's

578
00:25:52,359 --> 00:25:56,918
a very strong positive relationship

579
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:58,640
there so the a lot of the firmness is

580
00:25:56,919 --> 00:26:00,240
actually caused by the flower buds being

581
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:03,360
small so that's what you would expect

582
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:05,720
not surprising you have some other ones

583
00:26:03,359 --> 00:26:08,479
so plot uniformity is the plant-to-plant

584
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:10,120
variation um is not at all associated

585
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:13,079
with firmness you probably wouldn't

586
00:26:10,119 --> 00:26:15,759
expect them to be uh but so there's you

587
00:26:13,079 --> 00:26:20,359
find some are completely unrelated and

588
00:26:15,759 --> 00:26:23,679
then one as I just implied small beaded

589
00:26:20,359 --> 00:26:26,278
ones it's harder to hide

590
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:28,679
non-uniformity and so you'd expect a

591
00:26:26,278 --> 00:26:30,798
strong negative correlation there that

592
00:26:28,679 --> 00:26:33,159
the small beaded stuff tends to look

593
00:26:30,798 --> 00:26:36,440
less uniform and sure enough that's a

594
00:26:33,159 --> 00:26:39,600
negative relationship but the the way to

595
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:42,278
look at that is hey there's some here

596
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:44,959
that have small beads and look uniform

597
00:26:42,278 --> 00:26:46,960
great so breeders are great at tossing

598
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:49,079
out the junk and looking at only the

599
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:52,319
good stuff and so that's what happens

600
00:26:49,079 --> 00:26:57,240
here is you keep the good stuff

601
00:26:52,319 --> 00:27:00,119
uh and then in comparing the material

602
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:02,919
over these many you have to

603
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:04,959
really condense the information so we

604
00:27:02,919 --> 00:27:08,080
ended up using spider plots as one way

605
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:10,120
to describe it so each of the axes is a

606
00:27:08,079 --> 00:27:13,038
different trait and they're grouped a

607
00:27:10,119 --> 00:27:15,599
little bit so we've got firmness bead

608
00:27:13,038 --> 00:27:17,398
size bead uniformity are the first three

609
00:27:15,599 --> 00:27:20,359
so those are important traits that are

610
00:27:17,398 --> 00:27:23,719
difficult to get the Dome is also

611
00:27:20,359 --> 00:27:26,678
important and uh sensitive to heat a lot

612
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:29,759
of the time then head uniformity

613
00:27:26,679 --> 00:27:32,679
color uh head expression how far it

614
00:27:29,759 --> 00:27:35,759
comes up plot uniformity and holding

615
00:27:32,679 --> 00:27:38,600
time uh which you can see it's uh

616
00:27:35,759 --> 00:27:41,278
sensitive green is grown in cool

617
00:27:38,599 --> 00:27:44,278
conditions red in hot conditions so

618
00:27:41,278 --> 00:27:47,000
green magic is when we started was the

619
00:27:44,278 --> 00:27:48,960
most common Variety in the East Marathon

620
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:52,278
was the most common Variety in the world

621
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:55,038
you can see that uh it goes down to

622
00:27:52,278 --> 00:27:57,880
horrible low numbers when it's warm uh

623
00:27:55,038 --> 00:28:00,839
Iron Man was being sold for being tough

624
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:03,399
that's how got its name uh the red line

625
00:28:00,839 --> 00:28:05,199
is a lot smaller than the green line

626
00:28:03,398 --> 00:28:07,918
Castle Dome was another standard we

627
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:09,120
looked at so this was from the seconde

628
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:11,038
breeding

629
00:28:09,119 --> 00:28:15,678
trials

630
00:28:11,038 --> 00:28:18,640
uh we've got some that uh are fair in

631
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:20,919
the heat sensitive traits but really do

632
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:23,919
very nicely in everything else others

633
00:28:20,919 --> 00:28:26,759
that have really quite High numbers uh

634
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:28,880
in the heat sensitive traits and are not

635
00:28:26,759 --> 00:28:31,200
too bad in the other one

636
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:35,480
so we're able to uh look over the

637
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:39,159
different materials and so uh

638
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:42,000
skipping several years ahead now uh so

639
00:28:39,159 --> 00:28:44,159
this is this is the slide that I'm

640
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,000
actually very excited about so how fast

641
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:48,440
is the breeding progress when you're

642
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,880
working with very complicated traits

643
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:53,240
well if you're working with talented

644
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:57,360
breeders who know the art of breeding

645
00:28:53,240 --> 00:29:00,759
progress is fast so on our raing system

646
00:28:57,359 --> 00:29:03,119
uh a three was generally set at where

647
00:29:00,759 --> 00:29:05,240
the minimum commercial quality is so if

648
00:29:03,119 --> 00:29:08,439
it's a three you can probably sell it if

649
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:11,159
everything else is okay and four was

650
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:12,880
considered really good commercial

651
00:29:11,159 --> 00:29:16,120
quality and we went to five because some

652
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:18,039
of the traits go beyond that and so here

653
00:29:16,119 --> 00:29:19,839
uh I put the axis at three because it's

654
00:29:18,038 --> 00:29:22,440
the minimum and the top at four because

655
00:29:19,839 --> 00:29:27,720
that's what we ultimately want to see

656
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:28,679
each of these bars um is uh the average

657
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:34,000
of

658
00:29:28,679 --> 00:29:36,559
120 data points so they're pretty uh

659
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:39,159
strong as far as variation so the red

660
00:29:36,558 --> 00:29:41,319
lines are the standard so it's the same

661
00:29:39,159 --> 00:29:44,000
varieties every time five different

662
00:29:41,319 --> 00:29:46,879
standards that are averaged together and

663
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:49,240
the green are the five best lines in our

664
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:51,840
phase one trial so when we started this

665
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:54,079
was material that was people had it they

666
00:29:51,839 --> 00:29:56,199
thought it might be good uh so the best

667
00:29:54,079 --> 00:29:58,678
of those you see that they're a little

668
00:29:56,200 --> 00:30:02,519
bit improved in the uniform bead little

669
00:29:58,679 --> 00:30:05,240
bit smoother Dome the Dome stays okay

670
00:30:02,519 --> 00:30:07,839
and they're a little bit Greener so

671
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:10,120
that's what we started with and three

672
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:14,480
years of breeding later now the uniform

673
00:30:10,119 --> 00:30:17,599
bead is well into the commercial range

674
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:20,079
uh the the Dome is

675
00:30:17,599 --> 00:30:21,879
still well into the commercial range

676
00:30:20,079 --> 00:30:23,798
here on smoothness we've maintained the

677
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:26,039
Dome haven't given up on that and

678
00:30:23,798 --> 00:30:30,038
they're much Greener so we've had

679
00:30:26,038 --> 00:30:30,038
remarkable progress here

680
00:30:30,798 --> 00:30:37,278
uh so we've had and there's further

681
00:30:33,839 --> 00:30:39,158
crosses being made so the anticipation

682
00:30:37,278 --> 00:30:43,519
is that this will continue up but to be

683
00:30:39,159 --> 00:30:45,760
able to go from barely commercial to

684
00:30:43,519 --> 00:30:47,960
really well towards having everything

685
00:30:45,759 --> 00:30:50,759
hit commercial a lot of the time it's

686
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:53,558
tremendous Advance on the breeding end

687
00:30:50,759 --> 00:30:57,000
uh so to do that is a a picture we've

688
00:30:53,558 --> 00:30:58,519
gone from this in August to this in

689
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:01,359
August this one happens to to be one of

690
00:30:58,519 --> 00:31:03,359
marks but Griff has lines that also look

691
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:06,678
like this in the summertime so that you

692
00:31:03,359 --> 00:31:10,398
can sell and that is what the seed

693
00:31:06,679 --> 00:31:10,399
companies are interested in

694
00:31:14,038 --> 00:31:17,960
commercializing the uh

695
00:31:19,319 --> 00:31:28,038
U so the material that we started with

696
00:31:23,319 --> 00:31:31,278
here in the early one that is what has

697
00:31:28,038 --> 00:31:33,119
become released as commercial varieties

698
00:31:31,278 --> 00:31:35,960
and so they've been in the yield trial

699
00:31:33,119 --> 00:31:38,359
so just to show you graphically the how

700
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:42,079
the yield trials were laid out with the

701
00:31:38,359 --> 00:31:44,638
different production areas on the x-axis

702
00:31:42,079 --> 00:31:47,798
here in the year on the or on the year

703
00:31:44,638 --> 00:31:51,278
on the x-axis different uh locations on

704
00:31:47,798 --> 00:31:53,679
the y-axis uh but how you try to fit so

705
00:31:51,278 --> 00:31:56,240
that the growth happens when it's warm

706
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:58,159
enough but it's done and ready to

707
00:31:56,240 --> 00:32:00,720
harvest before it gets either too hot or

708
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:02,639
too cold uh depending on which end of

709
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:04,960
the season you're on so we tried to fit

710
00:32:02,638 --> 00:32:08,839
the different locations you can see we

711
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:11,360
go from very cold areas to the very warm

712
00:32:08,839 --> 00:32:14,439
areas to try to cover the whole

713
00:32:11,359 --> 00:32:18,038
season uh and these yield trials have

714
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:21,320
have shown that the new material is uh

715
00:32:18,038 --> 00:32:23,558
stable and Superior in each in their own

716
00:32:21,319 --> 00:32:25,398
locations we've had six varieties

717
00:32:23,558 --> 00:32:28,000
released by the seed companies in the

718
00:32:25,398 --> 00:32:29,918
first four years of the project and are

719
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:34,440
expecting a couple more to come out this

720
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:36,080
growing season um so the you know based

721
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:38,360
on the early stuff so the better the

722
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:39,798
better stuff is on the way it's in the

723
00:32:38,359 --> 00:32:43,959
in their

724
00:32:39,798 --> 00:32:47,158
pipeline uh but I think that is a great

725
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:50,558
result just thinking about uh in your

726
00:32:47,159 --> 00:32:53,799
own research what's the mechanism from

727
00:32:50,558 --> 00:32:56,240
getting it from your lab to Industry so

728
00:32:53,798 --> 00:32:58,119
it's for sale in the marketplace there's

729
00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:01,000
an awful lot of steps a lot awful a lot

730
00:32:58,119 --> 00:33:03,759
of time so seeing this much progress in

731
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:07,398
in four years uh is

732
00:33:03,759 --> 00:33:09,558
really uh remarkable and that's the the

733
00:33:07,398 --> 00:33:11,599
Breeders uh and seed companies in the

734
00:33:09,558 --> 00:33:14,558
project that have moved it along like

735
00:33:11,599 --> 00:33:16,678
that uh so then we come to the Growers

736
00:33:14,558 --> 00:33:20,638
where are The Growers going to be and

737
00:33:16,679 --> 00:33:22,320
how can we uh fit the new varieties in

738
00:33:20,638 --> 00:33:25,240
and look at how where we can stretch the

739
00:33:22,319 --> 00:33:28,638
season a little bit uh where should we

740
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:30,079
encourage new production and one of the

741
00:33:28,638 --> 00:33:32,119
elements of looking at that is to look

742
00:33:30,079 --> 00:33:33,918
at climate data we've got tremendous

743
00:33:32,119 --> 00:33:37,398
resources in climate data so we can look

744
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:42,038
at some uh patterns to try to guess

745
00:33:37,398 --> 00:33:44,278
where it might fit well and so I first

746
00:33:42,038 --> 00:33:47,000
do sort of a rough picture here I'm

747
00:33:44,278 --> 00:33:50,278
using selenis where the production is

748
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:52,278
currently I'm using as a proxy the mean

749
00:33:50,278 --> 00:33:54,599
minimum temperature what we actually use

750
00:33:52,278 --> 00:33:56,558
in the model is number of days that the

751
00:33:54,599 --> 00:33:59,439
nighttime temperature exceeds

752
00:33:56,558 --> 00:34:01,918
65° uh but but that's much harder to

753
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:03,480
draw uh so just the mean minimum

754
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:07,840
temperature

755
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:10,119
uh on actually a daily basis uh and so

756
00:34:07,839 --> 00:34:11,918
you can see Selenas is pretty flat so

757
00:34:10,119 --> 00:34:14,039
blue here is where it's really too cold

758
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:17,480
for it to grow red is where it's too

759
00:34:14,039 --> 00:34:22,519
warm for it to grow or for it to produce

760
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:25,280
nice heads uh so the Eastern location in

761
00:34:22,519 --> 00:34:28,000
Caribou main up there in the north uh

762
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:29,399
they have similarly cool middle of

763
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:32,760
Summer that's why they can produce it in

764
00:34:29,398 --> 00:34:35,358
the middle of summer but very different

765
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:37,879
pattern there in the continental climate

766
00:34:35,358 --> 00:34:40,878
if you look at Geneva you see that we're

767
00:34:37,878 --> 00:34:43,679
warmer than Maine uh and just touches

768
00:34:40,878 --> 00:34:45,480
that Red Zone in a tantalizing sort of

769
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:48,720
way Western New York is very productive

770
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:51,918
for coal Crop Production uh so a little

771
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:54,598
bit of improvement uh and we can uh

772
00:34:51,918 --> 00:34:57,358
probably do a lot so what about nearby

773
00:34:54,599 --> 00:34:59,480
areas so as an example I'll use Fremont

774
00:34:57,358 --> 00:35:02,199
Ohio it's on the southern shore of Lake

775
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:04,800
eries or so it's not that different it's

776
00:35:02,199 --> 00:35:06,519
just a little bit further south and so

777
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:10,119
you can see they pop up into the red

778
00:35:06,519 --> 00:35:12,719
area quite a bit and so it's actually

779
00:35:10,119 --> 00:35:15,599
quite a lot less suitable you'd have to

780
00:35:12,719 --> 00:35:18,279
make pretty big uh changes in the

781
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:20,559
temperature uh tolerance of broccoli to

782
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:22,960
go to that area so if we look at the

783
00:35:20,559 --> 00:35:24,920
harvest season Selenas actually harvests

784
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:28,000
from April through November and then

785
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:29,559
they move down to the desert um if you

786
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:32,559
look at Maine they actually start

787
00:35:29,559 --> 00:35:34,880
harvesting in July and they go until

788
00:35:32,559 --> 00:35:37,039
early October whenever they get frozen

789
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:39,358
out so you see that's quite a bit

790
00:35:37,039 --> 00:35:41,679
shorter season I've got up here sort of

791
00:35:39,358 --> 00:35:46,119
my guesses what the harvest season would

792
00:35:41,679 --> 00:35:50,239
be uh if you look at New York

793
00:35:46,119 --> 00:35:52,800
um that slope is steep right that's our

794
00:35:50,239 --> 00:35:53,919
problem it's changing fast and what we

795
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:56,599
know is that there's a lot of

796
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:59,119
variability in that but that's uh what

797
00:35:56,599 --> 00:36:02,280
our harvest season can look like and you

798
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:04,760
see that that Fremont Ohio is steeper

799
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:06,400
still and it's not so much that they're

800
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:08,520
warmer it's that they're steeper that

801
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:11,358
makes it a problem so their their season

802
00:36:08,519 --> 00:36:13,559
is quite a bit shorter too so that's

803
00:36:11,358 --> 00:36:16,519
going to be a

804
00:36:13,559 --> 00:36:20,480
challenge the other issue we deal with

805
00:36:16,519 --> 00:36:21,900
is rainfall so this is this past June do

806
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:23,358
you remember

807
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:25,519
[Laughter]

808
00:36:23,358 --> 00:36:29,318
June uh

809
00:36:25,519 --> 00:36:31,119
so that that's a deadly amount of water

810
00:36:29,318 --> 00:36:34,039
The Roots need to breathe those roots

811
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:38,039
are not breathing um and I like to

812
00:36:34,039 --> 00:36:40,639
compare broccoli production to dragster

813
00:36:38,039 --> 00:36:42,599
racing if you miss a shift in dragster

814
00:36:40,639 --> 00:36:44,598
racing you're kind out of the picture it

815
00:36:42,599 --> 00:36:48,760
doesn't matter and it's the same thing

816
00:36:44,599 --> 00:36:52,359
with broccoli and this is a Mis shift uh

817
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:55,240
it isn't making the transition from

818
00:36:52,358 --> 00:36:58,078
newly transplanted to Rapid growth uh

819
00:36:55,239 --> 00:36:59,439
quickly and uh then ends up being a big

820
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:03,240
problem and you'll get to see a little

821
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:03,240
bit how big

822
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:10,480
uh so looking at also at The Growers how

823
00:37:07,318 --> 00:37:13,039
should they produce broccoli uh to make

824
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:14,440
it profitable uh has to be more

825
00:37:13,039 --> 00:37:16,960
profitable than whatever they're growing

826
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:19,039
now and we need some hard numbers on

827
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:21,720
that and some production systems one

828
00:37:19,039 --> 00:37:26,239
thing I

829
00:37:21,719 --> 00:37:30,399
uh noted is that uh with cabbage which

830
00:37:26,239 --> 00:37:34,358
is very similar to br in many ways uh we

831
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:36,079
produce about 50 to 55 tons per acre in

832
00:37:34,358 --> 00:37:38,960
New York in the Southeast on much

833
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:41,920
lighter soils they around 30 tons an

834
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:45,400
acre uh and yet both locations are

835
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:48,720
producing uh typically 400 to 450 boxes

836
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:50,960
an acre about half of California

837
00:37:48,719 --> 00:37:53,519
so if you monkeyed around with the

838
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:55,240
growing a little bit could you move

839
00:37:53,519 --> 00:37:57,079
Western New York production a little bit

840
00:37:55,239 --> 00:37:58,118
closer to California than it is in

841
00:37:57,079 --> 00:38:00,480
Georgia

842
00:37:58,119 --> 00:38:04,000
and so we tried some nutrition and

843
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:07,440
particularly plant population changes so

844
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:09,920
the traditional population here is uh

845
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:13,679
similar to other transplanted vegetable

846
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:15,200
crops maybe 14 15 16,000 plants per acre

847
00:38:13,679 --> 00:38:17,199
so we're going with some higher numbers

848
00:38:15,199 --> 00:38:19,719
here so here there's the rows are 15

849
00:38:17,199 --> 00:38:22,960
inches apart and there's a every fourth

850
00:38:19,719 --> 00:38:27,159
row is skipped and they're either 6 8 or

851
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:29,199
12 in apart in the row um we know that

852
00:38:27,159 --> 00:38:31,078
there are production systems that will

853
00:38:29,199 --> 00:38:33,000
will pack them even as tight as this

854
00:38:31,079 --> 00:38:35,200
52,000

855
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:37,000
population so this is 2 weeks after

856
00:38:35,199 --> 00:38:39,118
transplanting what they should look like

857
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:42,440
they're filling in in the row for the

858
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:46,400
most part uh except for the 12in one uh

859
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:50,000
3 weeks you've got a pretty solid stand

860
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:54,318
uh here uh four and a half weeks this is

861
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:56,440
about when the herbicide wears off so

862
00:38:54,318 --> 00:38:59,000
you know weed management is one of the

863
00:38:56,440 --> 00:39:00,720
big problems so if your herbicide wears

864
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:02,039
off and the Weeds start germinating at

865
00:39:00,719 --> 00:39:04,279
this point how big a problem are the

866
00:39:02,039 --> 00:39:07,079
weeds going to

867
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:09,720
be they basically don't stand a chance

868
00:39:07,079 --> 00:39:11,640
the root the broccoli Roots fill the

869
00:39:09,719 --> 00:39:14,118
entire soil and there's no light coming

870
00:39:11,639 --> 00:39:16,519
to the ground so weed management really

871
00:39:14,119 --> 00:39:20,920
works out nice if you have this kind of

872
00:39:16,519 --> 00:39:23,280
growth um and 52 days is when Harvest

873
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:25,280
begins uh so on this one you can see

874
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:28,280
it's a little bit lighter green because

875
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:31,160
the uh nitrogen is moving towards heads

876
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:33,119
fact few little leaves that were shaded

877
00:39:31,159 --> 00:39:36,639
out they're moving the nitrogen up into

878
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:39,079
the head so doing very high fertility

879
00:39:36,639 --> 00:39:42,199
production but not excessive fertility

880
00:39:39,079 --> 00:39:45,119
uh nitrogen's being used effectively so

881
00:39:42,199 --> 00:39:47,358
what happens uh in terms of productivity

882
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:51,119
with these so here's a graph of the

883
00:39:47,358 --> 00:39:54,679
cumulative yields so the uh lowest

884
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:57,760
population does uh exactly what

885
00:39:54,679 --> 00:40:00,440
experience has been with low populations

886
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:03,960
uh it starts to produce you do three

887
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:07,480
cuts and you've got uh a yield here we

888
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:09,240
got about 550 because we're doing uh

889
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:12,079
high fertility there so we beat the

890
00:40:09,239 --> 00:40:15,000
state average on that one with the

891
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:17,240
intermediate population there's about a

892
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:19,239
5-day delay in maturity so you're giving

893
00:40:17,239 --> 00:40:21,959
up something there but there's more

894
00:40:19,239 --> 00:40:24,239
plants that produce heads uh so you're

895
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:26,358
putting up the yield close to 700 on

896
00:40:24,239 --> 00:40:28,439
that one when they were packed

897
00:40:26,358 --> 00:40:29,960
tighter

898
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:31,679
then they started competing with each

899
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:34,440
other so even though they were only

900
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:36,559
delayed a few more days uh they start

901
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:39,440
pooping out and so there's a lot of

902
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:41,838
plants that don't make anything

903
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:46,519
harvestable at all so they were too

904
00:40:41,838 --> 00:40:51,719
tight uh so we found that moving up into

905
00:40:46,519 --> 00:40:54,079
the 30s 30,000 something uh is going to

906
00:40:51,719 --> 00:40:57,480
be a lot better than 15,000 which is

907
00:40:54,079 --> 00:41:01,599
where people generally are now uh found

908
00:40:57,480 --> 00:41:03,159
with quality so I used a hollow this is

909
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:07,280
hollow stem here a hollow stem

910
00:41:03,159 --> 00:41:09,279
susceptible variety uh in this trial uh

911
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:12,440
it's a delicious tasting one so it's

912
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:14,400
popular for that uh and it's basically

913
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:16,318
how thick the stem is determines whether

914
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:19,039
the pith is going to open

915
00:41:16,318 --> 00:41:21,519
up and so if you look at the head weight

916
00:41:19,039 --> 00:41:22,920
these are all 5in heads so the heavier

917
00:41:21,519 --> 00:41:24,519
heads are the ones that have thicker

918
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:27,519
stems that's the dimension that's

919
00:41:24,519 --> 00:41:29,719
changing uh and at the low population

920
00:41:27,519 --> 00:41:34,159
we're getting big thick stems with lots

921
00:41:29,719 --> 00:41:35,959
of hollow stem at the highest population

922
00:41:34,159 --> 00:41:40,519
we're getting undersized heads we want

923
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:42,838
to try to keep them close to2 kilos uh

924
00:41:40,519 --> 00:41:44,960
so the intermediate population not only

925
00:41:42,838 --> 00:41:49,039
gave the highest yield it gave the

926
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:51,318
highest quality so this tells us what

927
00:41:49,039 --> 00:41:54,400
the optimal population should look like

928
00:41:51,318 --> 00:41:58,239
and so Growers can find uh what their

929
00:41:54,400 --> 00:42:00,720
own is but they said we're doing to see

930
00:41:58,239 --> 00:42:04,919
when you make money so let's do the

931
00:42:00,719 --> 00:42:07,439
numbers on that uh so 2013 was an

932
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:09,559
excellent year for growing broccoli uh

933
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:12,039
it did very well the green curve is the

934
00:42:09,559 --> 00:42:14,559
revenue the red curve is the total cost

935
00:42:12,039 --> 00:42:17,880
and we're figuring everything owning the

936
00:42:14,559 --> 00:42:19,519
tractors the barns interest payments all

937
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:23,640
of that stuff so this is not marginal

938
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:23,639
cost it's total cost

939
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:30,440
uh by way of comparison good corn crop

940
00:42:28,519 --> 00:42:33,159
is worth

941
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:37,280
600700 it's way down

942
00:42:33,159 --> 00:42:41,759
there so this is very big money compared

943
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:43,800
with uh even some profitable crops uh so

944
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:46,000
the low population make pretty good

945
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:49,480
money intermediate population make even

946
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:52,119
more money 2014 was a challenging year

947
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:55,280
we had a hail storm come through just

948
00:42:52,119 --> 00:42:57,480
before heading another Mist shift if you

949
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:59,680
will uh where the plants really were

950
00:42:57,480 --> 00:43:02,000
shocked they stopped growing for several

951
00:42:59,679 --> 00:43:05,358
days just from the physical shock of the

952
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:08,159
the hail storm uh so we had lower yields

953
00:43:05,358 --> 00:43:11,039
then

954
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:14,159
uh but if you look at those differences

955
00:43:11,039 --> 00:43:16,838
where the profit is that intermediate

956
00:43:14,159 --> 00:43:20,239
population still made good

957
00:43:16,838 --> 00:43:23,639
money going with a lower population just

958
00:43:20,239 --> 00:43:25,759
barely broke even and even that one is

959
00:43:23,639 --> 00:43:27,759
higher than the industry standard so

960
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:30,440
moving those populations up

961
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:33,720
is going to make broccoli a lot more

962
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:36,159
economically attractive so 2015 I showed

963
00:43:33,719 --> 00:43:38,358
you what 2015 looks like it was a

964
00:43:36,159 --> 00:43:40,000
terrible terrible year so what happens

965
00:43:38,358 --> 00:43:43,279
when you have a terrible year with that

966
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:46,159
huge investment well the costs are still

967
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:48,119
high and at the lower population it

968
00:43:46,159 --> 00:43:49,960
still pulled it out it turned out to be

969
00:43:48,119 --> 00:43:52,680
all bunching broccoli instead of crown

970
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:56,358
broccoli uh so the highest population

971
00:43:52,679 --> 00:43:59,159
lost money but the grower still doesn't

972
00:43:56,358 --> 00:44:03,119
lose a ton of money even when there's a

973
00:43:59,159 --> 00:44:04,679
really disastrous event so sometimes you

974
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:07,480
don't you don't make much money but at

975
00:44:04,679 --> 00:44:10,838
least you don't you you have $6,000 an

976
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:12,318
acre at risk there so uh coming out even

977
00:44:10,838 --> 00:44:13,838
with that one is actually pretty good

978
00:44:12,318 --> 00:44:17,400
news in a terrible

979
00:44:13,838 --> 00:44:22,960
year uh so to continue down the line of

980
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:26,318
the economic analysis uh for uh making

981
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:27,880
that money here's the price per box over

982
00:44:26,318 --> 00:44:32,079
the last five

983
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:34,480
years uh at Eastern Terminal Markets so

984
00:44:32,079 --> 00:44:37,440
prices vary all over the place depending

985
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:40,119
on how you're uh who you're selling it

986
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:42,519
to but the terminal market price at

987
00:44:40,119 --> 00:44:44,240
least is basically the same thing all

988
00:44:42,519 --> 00:44:46,318
the time so you know what's going on

989
00:44:44,239 --> 00:44:49,039
there and they're reported every week so

990
00:44:46,318 --> 00:44:51,400
you can get the numbers on them uh

991
00:44:49,039 --> 00:44:54,039
looked at the blue line is a bunch and

992
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:56,160
the green line is a crown the market is

993
00:44:54,039 --> 00:45:00,159
more and more Crown cut there's a few

994
00:44:56,159 --> 00:45:02,199
holdouts that are still doing bunches uh

995
00:45:00,159 --> 00:45:05,078
the southeast which is very conservative

996
00:45:02,199 --> 00:45:06,719
in their food tastes New York City which

997
00:45:05,079 --> 00:45:09,000
apparently is very conservative in its

998
00:45:06,719 --> 00:45:12,919
food tastes you want to draw that

999
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:15,400
inference uh and U organic tends to go

1000
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:17,358
with a bunch but the bulk of the market

1001
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:19,039
these days is Crown you can see that

1002
00:45:17,358 --> 00:45:20,799
there used to be a differential between

1003
00:45:19,039 --> 00:45:24,239
the two but for the last few years

1004
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:27,480
that's pretty much gone

1005
00:45:24,239 --> 00:45:29,519
um the price jumps around a lot from

1006
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:33,358
year to year so if you're a grower going

1007
00:45:29,519 --> 00:45:35,759
into a spot market like this uh it can

1008
00:45:33,358 --> 00:45:38,759
be very hard to budget and so it's

1009
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:41,760
really important to make sure that uh

1010
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:44,559
at4 $15 you're making

1011
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:45,920
money and sometimes you make a lot of

1012
00:45:44,559 --> 00:45:48,640
money but you don't know when that's

1013
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:52,280
going to happen uh some years there's a

1014
00:45:48,639 --> 00:45:55,000
transition right around uh New Years it

1015
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:58,440
often uh comes as they're switching over

1016
00:45:55,000 --> 00:46:03,239
production uh from Selena to the desert

1017
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:06,000
and sometimes um there's a big extra

1018
00:46:03,239 --> 00:46:08,598
Supply coming out of Mexico right around

1019
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:10,199
then that they're trying to catch that

1020
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:12,119
so we looked at the total production

1021
00:46:10,199 --> 00:46:13,358
costs for the East to see how they

1022
00:46:12,119 --> 00:46:15,960
compare with

1023
00:46:13,358 --> 00:46:19,400
California and we looked at some models

1024
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:24,240
and the the numbers came in remarkably

1025
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:26,559
similar they're all like 111 and I'd put

1026
00:46:24,239 --> 00:46:30,479
several dollars of error bars on each of

1027
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:34,119
these because it depend so much locally

1028
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:36,480
uh but these numbers are definitely

1029
00:46:34,119 --> 00:46:40,318
competitive but what goes into those

1030
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:42,119
varies a great deal uh that the cost

1031
00:46:40,318 --> 00:46:45,639
structure so California Water costs a

1032
00:46:42,119 --> 00:46:47,039
lot here water comes down free Power

1033
00:46:45,639 --> 00:46:49,400
sometimes too much but it comes down

1034
00:46:47,039 --> 00:46:51,440
free land is very expensive in

1035
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:54,240
California land is not very expensive

1036
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:56,280
here uh labor is much more difficult to

1037
00:46:54,239 --> 00:46:57,639
get here so there's there's significant

1038
00:46:56,280 --> 00:47:00,800
differences

1039
00:46:57,639 --> 00:47:03,279
one of the big variables so yeah so I'll

1040
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:05,920
remind you so the price chart $15

1041
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:08,680
production costs 11 so that's kind of

1042
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:10,358
where your potential profit margin is

1043
00:47:08,679 --> 00:47:13,679
one of the big variables is the post

1044
00:47:10,358 --> 00:47:15,440
Harvest costs so broccoli is all really

1045
00:47:13,679 --> 00:47:18,960
rapidly growing tissue right it's

1046
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:22,079
respiring like crazy and so if you take

1047
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:24,280
a bunch of broccoli that's at out in the

1048
00:47:22,079 --> 00:47:25,880
sunshine and you put it in a box and you

1049
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:27,440
put a bunch of boxes together and

1050
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:29,039
they're all busy respiring

1051
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:31,760
at a very high temperature what's going

1052
00:47:29,039 --> 00:47:33,199
to happen they're going to get hot

1053
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:34,680
they're going to turn yellow they're

1054
00:47:33,199 --> 00:47:38,838
going to burn up all their sugar they're

1055
00:47:34,679 --> 00:47:40,719
going to be awful so it has to get cold

1056
00:47:38,838 --> 00:47:44,199
really quickly and there's been a lot of

1057
00:47:40,719 --> 00:47:48,480
work done on this and cold means 32°

1058
00:47:44,199 --> 00:47:50,519
fahren it doesn't mean 38° 38 degre

1059
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:54,039
rapid rapid

1060
00:47:50,519 --> 00:47:57,440
enough respiration to cost a lot of

1061
00:47:54,039 --> 00:47:59,759
quality from the farm uh to the B

1062
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:01,200
so getting it cold is critical so

1063
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:03,119
there's a number of different

1064
00:48:01,199 --> 00:48:06,879
Technologies and it depends on the scale

1065
00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:09,160
that the grower is working at uh so one

1066
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:12,318
of the most common is hydrocooling where

1067
00:48:09,159 --> 00:48:13,920
you basically dip it into ice cold water

1068
00:48:12,318 --> 00:48:16,639
so this is

1069
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:18,838
a conveyor belt that takes the Box takes

1070
00:48:16,639 --> 00:48:21,639
it down into the ice cold water up it

1071
00:48:18,838 --> 00:48:24,078
comes again really very simple

1072
00:48:21,639 --> 00:48:26,118
straightforward not very expensive you

1073
00:48:24,079 --> 00:48:28,400
have to have access to gigantic blocks

1074
00:48:26,119 --> 00:48:31,358
of ice at low cost but if you've got

1075
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:33,720
that that's pretty good one that lasts a

1076
00:48:31,358 --> 00:48:35,679
lot longer is this liquid ice injection

1077
00:48:33,719 --> 00:48:37,719
so here the boxes are open there's a

1078
00:48:35,679 --> 00:48:39,440
dispenser and it dispenses a bunch of

1079
00:48:37,719 --> 00:48:42,000
chipped ice on

1080
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:44,800
top that works great on a small scale

1081
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:48,800
but doing those boxes one at a time uh

1082
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:51,359
is high Labor uh one that we've seen

1083
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:54,720
that doesn't cool very much is just

1084
00:48:51,358 --> 00:48:56,838
using the tap water or well water

1085
00:48:54,719 --> 00:48:59,239
that's whatever the temperature of your

1086
00:48:56,838 --> 00:49:01,639
your groundwater is uh that'll take a

1087
00:48:59,239 --> 00:49:04,838
lot of the field heat out so if you are

1088
00:49:01,639 --> 00:49:07,598
delivering on the same day it'll be cold

1089
00:49:04,838 --> 00:49:09,318
enough as long as it gets sold within a

1090
00:49:07,599 --> 00:49:11,680
day you can get away with it that's

1091
00:49:09,318 --> 00:49:14,679
really cheap if you have that water

1092
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:16,558
available then cooling with solid ice

1093
00:49:14,679 --> 00:49:18,598
this is absolutely the cheapest one the

1094
00:49:16,559 --> 00:49:21,280
one everybody starts with because all it

1095
00:49:18,599 --> 00:49:22,798
takes is one of those plastic shovels

1096
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:25,040
and a box full of ice from the ice

1097
00:49:22,798 --> 00:49:27,960
company and you shovel the ice into the

1098
00:49:25,039 --> 00:49:31,519
box one by one uh very labor intensive

1099
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:33,000
it costs a fortune per box uh so for

1100
00:49:31,519 --> 00:49:35,159
people starting out they use that one

1101
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:38,400
but the incentive to switch to something

1102
00:49:35,159 --> 00:49:41,759
else uh is quick what they use in

1103
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:44,480
California a huge scale it is actually

1104
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:46,760
not super cheap but they have to do this

1105
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:49,400
to get it across the country and that is

1106
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:52,960
they inject an ice water slurry into an

1107
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:54,720
entire pallet of boxes and so the water

1108
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:56,880
ice mixture goes in there it gets into

1109
00:49:54,719 --> 00:49:58,598
every nook and cranny and the water

1110
00:49:56,880 --> 00:50:01,599
comes

1111
00:49:58,599 --> 00:50:01,599
out

1112
00:50:03,798 --> 00:50:08,639
um so finally I mentioned that it's hard

1113
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:11,839
to get Market access for Growers here

1114
00:50:08,639 --> 00:50:12,679
and it's hard for the markets to access

1115
00:50:11,838 --> 00:50:15,679
the

1116
00:50:12,679 --> 00:50:15,679
Growers

1117
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:22,240
and these are a bunch of the problems

1118
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:24,559
that people have run into and we have a

1119
00:50:22,239 --> 00:50:26,798
program going on in New York and a few

1120
00:50:24,559 --> 00:50:29,599
other states in the East that is is

1121
00:50:26,798 --> 00:50:31,798
Under The Heading of food Hub and these

1122
00:50:29,599 --> 00:50:33,480
are aggregation sites where there's a

1123
00:50:31,798 --> 00:50:36,519
manager who will work with a number of

1124
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:38,798
different farms and consolidate

1125
00:50:36,519 --> 00:50:40,920
shipments uh work with Buyers who are

1126
00:50:38,798 --> 00:50:42,559
used to calling up Selenas and saying

1127
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:44,880
hey I need two truckloads of this and

1128
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:47,119
that uh that they'll be able to speak

1129
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:49,519
the same language as the buyers and be

1130
00:50:47,119 --> 00:50:53,559
able to negotiate fairly Among The

1131
00:50:49,519 --> 00:50:56,239
Growers uh to meet know it looks the way

1132
00:50:53,559 --> 00:50:57,599
it should look comes in the amount you

1133
00:50:56,239 --> 00:51:00,479
promis

1134
00:50:57,599 --> 00:51:02,559
uh it allows them to use cooling

1135
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:05,199
technology more

1136
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:07,119
efficiently uh and so developing these

1137
00:51:05,199 --> 00:51:09,279
food hubs is something that's moving

1138
00:51:07,119 --> 00:51:12,358
along we're having a great time working

1139
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:14,920
with the uh really the extension system

1140
00:51:12,358 --> 00:51:19,440
is where the strength is in this

1141
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:24,280
one uh so the question now

1142
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:24,280
is can broccoli be as cool as

1143
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:31,519
kale uh

1144
00:51:28,039 --> 00:51:32,920
so uh so that's that's the last slide so

1145
00:51:31,519 --> 00:51:35,960
I've told you a little bit about the

1146
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:37,318
breeding and the physiology uh and how

1147
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:39,720
we're taking that and how do you bring

1148
00:51:37,318 --> 00:51:42,239
it to Market so that the seed companies

1149
00:51:39,719 --> 00:51:44,838
have an incentive to Market to the

1150
00:51:42,239 --> 00:51:47,239
Eastern Growers so that we can have a

1151
00:51:44,838 --> 00:51:51,400
good base of Eastern Growers all the way

1152
00:51:47,239 --> 00:51:54,279
from imoc uh to the St John River Valley

1153
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:55,838
in the north with in particular a nice

1154
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:58,720
big group in Western New York where

1155
00:51:55,838 --> 00:52:00,358
there's huge potential uh for tens of

1156
00:51:58,719 --> 00:52:02,429
millions of dollars of production in the

1157
00:52:00,358 --> 00:52:07,960
next few years so that thanks very

1158
00:52:02,429 --> 00:52:11,239
[Applause]

1159
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:13,559
much um is there any interest inting

1160
00:52:11,239 --> 00:52:13,558
like the

1161
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:20,119
non-heading um there are uh non-heading

1162
00:52:17,798 --> 00:52:24,039
broccoli varieties but the labor cost in

1163
00:52:20,119 --> 00:52:25,559
harvesting is so high that uh that is

1164
00:52:24,039 --> 00:52:28,558
very

1165
00:52:25,559 --> 00:52:28,559
limited

1166
00:52:32,519 --> 00:52:37,719
no the the non-heading types have

1167
00:52:35,358 --> 00:52:39,880
receive much less greeding so the

1168
00:52:37,719 --> 00:52:42,118
quality consistency is lower the

1169
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:44,240
productivity is

1170
00:52:42,119 --> 00:52:47,240
lower of

1171
00:52:44,239 --> 00:52:49,199
Fortune great for uh Market Gardens and

1172
00:52:47,239 --> 00:52:52,399
home

1173
00:52:49,199 --> 00:52:54,159
GS so of all those traits that you

1174
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:58,079
believe to be the most important it's

1175
00:52:54,159 --> 00:53:01,239
the doming that is the one really change

1176
00:52:58,079 --> 00:53:04,079
the do do you know I me it stayed about

1177
00:53:01,239 --> 00:53:07,558
the same right do you know any genes

1178
00:53:04,079 --> 00:53:12,680
that control doing based on work

1179
00:53:07,559 --> 00:53:16,280
inas or so the uh so the flattening of

1180
00:53:12,679 --> 00:53:19,239
the Dome is when the outer branches the

1181
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:22,079
oldest branches start to grow first as

1182
00:53:19,239 --> 00:53:25,679
it's getting ready to bolt it's getting

1183
00:53:22,079 --> 00:53:29,559
closer to anesis uh those will start to

1184
00:53:25,679 --> 00:53:34,199
grow timing of that

1185
00:53:29,559 --> 00:53:36,880
station relative to the maturity of the

1186
00:53:34,199 --> 00:53:40,679
head uh that that timing is shifted as

1187
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:42,838
all so that's that's what under so I

1188
00:53:40,679 --> 00:53:44,919
don't know which G's control that for

1189
00:53:42,838 --> 00:53:47,880
sure but that's the that's the timing

1190
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:52,159
event that's

1191
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:52,160
different a genetically complex

1192
00:53:53,318 --> 00:53:56,679
trait this seems like an obvious

1193
00:53:55,318 --> 00:53:58,519
question but are you working with any

1194
00:53:56,679 --> 00:54:02,919
Poop House Growers or doing any trials

1195
00:53:58,519 --> 00:54:05,798
in hoop houses uh it doesn't seem like

1196
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:07,440
that's going to pay off for most markets

1197
00:54:05,798 --> 00:54:11,400
because we can move up and down the

1198
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:14,280
coast uh that uh the cost of producing

1199
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:15,720
broccoli in the hoop house uh is so much

1200
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:18,079
higher than shipping it from a few

1201
00:54:15,719 --> 00:54:20,199
hundred miles away which is the distance

1202
00:54:18,079 --> 00:54:21,880
that the hoop house would benefit so for

1203
00:54:20,199 --> 00:54:23,919
the non-heading types there's actually

1204
00:54:21,880 --> 00:54:27,039
some work in

1205
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:28,760
uh on the Atlantic seaboard for doing

1206
00:54:27,039 --> 00:54:30,239
fop houses with some of the non-heading

1207
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:33,960
ones they can actually over mure them

1208
00:54:30,239 --> 00:54:36,000
and so they work on for a CSA a

1209
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:39,079
restaurant you can have those in very

1210
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:41,480
early spring

1211
00:54:39,079 --> 00:54:46,079
February

1212
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:50,559
that's we have a we have a question

1213
00:54:46,079 --> 00:54:54,160
from yeah Thomas uh what are other goals

1214
00:54:50,559 --> 00:54:57,440
of the project in next

1215
00:54:54,159 --> 00:55:01,000
pH so the major goal in the next phase

1216
00:54:57,440 --> 00:55:03,000
of the project are easy to answer

1217
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:07,599
because I'm busy writing the grand

1218
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:09,639
proposal right now uh so we want to

1219
00:55:07,599 --> 00:55:12,880
understand uh the genetics of the

1220
00:55:09,639 --> 00:55:15,279
complex traits better because to improve

1221
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:17,400
them further uh we're going to have to

1222
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:19,599
use molecular markers to identify the

1223
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:24,240
combinations because we're not going to

1224
00:55:19,599 --> 00:55:29,400
get enough difference uh between uh

1225
00:55:24,239 --> 00:55:33,479
single we'll call them one one level of

1226
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:35,880
uh genetic uh tolerance from a high

1227
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:37,559
level just that stacking uh because

1228
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:40,000
they're not single Gene traits I'm going

1229
00:55:37,559 --> 00:55:42,680
to be careful about my terminology here

1230
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:44,119
uh but to put more layers of that on uh

1231
00:55:42,679 --> 00:55:46,480
we need to be using the molecular

1232
00:55:44,119 --> 00:55:49,920
markers to see when we're combining uh

1233
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:54,639
different sources of resistance uh

1234
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:56,039
developing the uh the food hubs is

1235
00:55:54,639 --> 00:55:58,440
actually a significant part of it

1236
00:55:56,039 --> 00:56:01,520
because we need to make that volume grow

1237
00:55:58,440 --> 00:56:05,960
and getting the the new Growers who

1238
00:56:01,519 --> 00:56:09,119
might be uh say 10 to 100 acres of

1239
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:12,119
broccoli uh that kind of scale for their

1240
00:56:09,119 --> 00:56:15,000
broccoli as part of their uh vegetable

1241
00:56:12,119 --> 00:56:17,519
mix um they're going to need the

1242
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:20,838
distribution

1243
00:56:17,519 --> 00:56:23,400
channels and getting that Regional

1244
00:56:20,838 --> 00:56:25,519
trialing system expanded to include a

1245
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:28,079
lot more seat companies so there's more

1246
00:56:25,519 --> 00:56:30,000
contribution the overall uh Improvement

1247
00:56:28,079 --> 00:56:34,680
of varities those are the areas that

1248
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:34,679
we're looking at uh primarily

1249
00:56:34,719 --> 00:56:42,000
for Thomas in terms of carbon footprint

1250
00:56:39,039 --> 00:56:44,160
yeah might it not be argued that

1251
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:50,199
Trucking broccoli

1252
00:56:44,159 --> 00:56:53,358
fromi to New York or Boston is as carbon

1253
00:56:50,199 --> 00:56:55,239
intensive as flying it from California

1254
00:56:53,358 --> 00:56:58,558
to New York

1255
00:56:55,239 --> 00:57:03,000
well but Trucking the trucking yeah if

1256
00:56:58,559 --> 00:57:06,798
you're going yeah deoc to Boston or

1257
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:09,400
versus selus to Boston or actually

1258
00:57:06,798 --> 00:57:12,639
theuma to Boston in that case

1259
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:16,760
uh it's not a huge difference because

1260
00:57:12,639 --> 00:57:19,598
they're both big yeah and likewise going

1261
00:57:16,760 --> 00:57:19,599
from

1262
00:57:20,798 --> 00:57:27,358
U ariso County name to Atlanta we're

1263
00:57:24,239 --> 00:57:30,838
going from Guan in Mexico to Atlanta

1264
00:57:27,358 --> 00:57:34,400
that's not really very good you so you

1265
00:57:30,838 --> 00:57:36,440
you do hit a sort of Break Even point

1266
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:39,200
there and that's where Miguel Gomez's

1267
00:57:36,440 --> 00:57:41,000
work has been modeling that as far as

1268
00:57:39,199 --> 00:57:44,399
for each of the different major markets

1269
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:47,639
in the East U how much should be

1270
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:50,400
supplied from East Coast but a distance

1271
00:57:47,639 --> 00:57:52,239
for it to make sense so we don't try to

1272
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:53,920
invest in something that really doesn't

1273
00:57:52,239 --> 00:57:58,239
have very much potential because there's

1274
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:58,240
not that much local benefit

1275
00:57:58,358 --> 00:58:03,759
I'm just curious about is is a spring or

1276
00:58:01,358 --> 00:58:06,358
fall a better Market or is it does it do

1277
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:08,559
better in spring fall in this region way

1278
00:58:06,358 --> 00:58:09,920
better than the fall way better spring

1279
00:58:08,559 --> 00:58:12,359
is really challenging because it wants

1280
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:14,480
to grow when it's warm vegetatively and

1281
00:58:12,358 --> 00:58:15,960
it wants to head when it's cold and

1282
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:18,318
that's the exact opposite of what

1283
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:20,079
happens in the springtime so spring is

1284
00:58:18,318 --> 00:58:22,960
really difficult that's our most

1285
00:58:20,079 --> 00:58:25,559
difficult season to find

1286
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:28,159
adap well I want to thank Thomas for

1287
00:58:25,559 --> 00:58:28,160
fascinating

1288
00:58:31,239 --> 00:58:38,959
this has been a production of Cornell
