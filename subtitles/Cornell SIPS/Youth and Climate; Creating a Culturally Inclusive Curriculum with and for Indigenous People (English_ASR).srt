1
00:00:12,558 --> 00:00:17,239
okay well hi everyone uh thanks for

2
00:00:15,199 --> 00:00:19,799
sticking around for on this call today

3
00:00:17,239 --> 00:00:22,118
about Youth and climate and I'll share

4
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:24,760
an experience about developing

5
00:00:22,118 --> 00:00:26,800
curriculum with and for indigenous

6
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:28,320
peoples and there's a lot of lessons

7
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,400
learned with this project and if you

8
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,799
have any interest of working with IND

9
00:00:30,399 --> 00:00:35,280
people hopefully you'll be able to learn

10
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:37,280
a few things from our own experience and

11
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,079
apply them as well or Not Apply them if

12
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,520
they were something that didn't work on

13
00:00:39,079 --> 00:00:43,558
our end and we'll share both the

14
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:45,600
positives and the Lessons Learned um

15
00:00:43,558 --> 00:00:47,839
that we wouldn't do again in this whole

16
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:51,198
journey so here we go in a few minutes

17
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:53,680
we'll just do a whirlwind uh tour of

18
00:00:51,198 --> 00:00:56,358
that experience and I'll um I'll make

19
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:59,600
sure to cover all aspects in the brief

20
00:00:56,359 --> 00:01:00,960
time we have together so as I start

21
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,559
sharing some background about this

22
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:06,519
project I'll just put a question in the

23
00:01:02,558 --> 00:01:09,759
chat for all of you to think about and

24
00:01:06,519 --> 00:01:13,560
respond to both attendees and panelists

25
00:01:09,759 --> 00:01:16,079
um as I'm talking so if you could just

26
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:18,159
review that and when you have a moment

27
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:20,759
of inspiration want to share that with

28
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:25,439
everyone that would be fantastic in the

29
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:27,438
chat okay so this uh brief story is

30
00:01:25,438 --> 00:01:30,758
about my experience in the Colorado

31
00:01:27,438 --> 00:01:32,839
Plateau area of Utah I'm in Moab in

32
00:01:30,759 --> 00:01:34,759
um just north of the Navajo Nation and

33
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:38,079
surrounded by a range of tribes

34
00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:41,840
including the Ute tribe the Hopi uh

35
00:01:38,078 --> 00:01:44,359
tribe as well and uh there's the Apachi

36
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:46,759
and a range of other tribes that live

37
00:01:44,359 --> 00:01:50,599
still in this area and have a very

38
00:01:46,759 --> 00:01:53,359
strong presence here and uh as part of a

39
00:01:50,599 --> 00:01:55,959
necki initiative actually uh Patricia

40
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:57,599
Townsen in Washington formed a team and

41
00:01:55,959 --> 00:02:00,199
we submitted a National Science

42
00:01:57,599 --> 00:02:02,280
Foundation Grant to do this project

43
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:04,680
called climate change Community programs

44
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:06,640
and opportunities uh if you look at the

45
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:10,399
acronym of that what I just said it's C

46
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:13,800
C3PO so we had a little nerdy Star Wars

47
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:15,959
U acronym for our project and Patricia

48
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:18,760
in her project worked with let next

49
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:21,519
population in Washington and I worked

50
00:02:18,759 --> 00:02:23,479
with Alaska or I worked with uh

51
00:02:21,519 --> 00:02:26,239
indigenous populations in Utah my

52
00:02:23,479 --> 00:02:30,439
colleague art worked with uh indigenous

53
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:33,159
youth in Alaska and uh in Pennsylvania

54
00:02:30,439 --> 00:02:37,079
Melissa Cay worked with um women Forest

55
00:02:33,159 --> 00:02:40,280
donors so again my audience was uh not

56
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:42,159
youth but College age students and and

57
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:46,759
so I'll just share that right from the

58
00:02:42,158 --> 00:02:49,120
onset that still youth but not um not

59
00:02:46,759 --> 00:02:51,878
same as 4 youth for

60
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:54,959
example okay so at the beginning of this

61
00:02:51,878 --> 00:02:56,919
NSF grant our whole plan was to apply uh

62
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:58,560
already created an excellent curriculum

63
00:02:56,919 --> 00:03:00,759
from the University of California called

64
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,878
climate stewards and

65
00:03:00,759 --> 00:03:05,318
what I learned over time is that a

66
00:03:02,878 --> 00:03:07,798
canned curriculum applied to indigenous

67
00:03:05,318 --> 00:03:10,199
populations even if it is adaptive was

68
00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:11,680
not going to work very well and it

69
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:13,000
wasn't going to be the best approach

70
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:17,799
that we had to design this from the

71
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:21,239
ground up and uh so that was one lesson

72
00:03:17,799 --> 00:03:24,760
learned along the way we H we formed an

73
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:26,878
advisory Council of um professionals and

74
00:03:24,759 --> 00:03:28,280
tribal members that had extensive

75
00:03:26,878 --> 00:03:30,039
experience working with indigenous

76
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:33,438
communities and or living in indigenous

77
00:03:30,039 --> 00:03:34,959
communities to guide our process as we

78
00:03:33,438 --> 00:03:36,878
uh rolled out our game plan for

79
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:41,280
developing a curriculum focused around

80
00:03:36,878 --> 00:03:43,598
climate change uh it involved over time

81
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:46,239
uh first of all we needed to expand our

82
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:48,119
timeline we learned right away with uh

83
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:50,719
with with beyond the boundaries of the

84
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:53,079
NSF Grant because building the

85
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:55,878
relationships with tribal members took a

86
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:57,920
lot longer than um even we had imagined

87
00:03:55,878 --> 00:03:59,438
at the beginning and so definitely

88
00:03:57,919 --> 00:04:01,518
extending timelines is an important

89
00:03:59,438 --> 00:04:03,680
aspect ECT of working with indigenous

90
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:05,480
communities and that's difficult in our

91
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:08,000
academic environments with the Turn and

92
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:08,000
Burn

93
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:13,799
of and uh giving us many reality checks

94
00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:16,519
like first of all our timeline was

95
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:20,358
unrealistic and uh from those talking

96
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:23,560
circles we also uh or sorry from The

97
00:04:20,358 --> 00:04:26,758
Advisory Council we also um receiv

98
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:28,759
received guidance on hiring someone who

99
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:32,080
with experience working with tribal

100
00:04:28,759 --> 00:04:34,560
members to help us decolonize our survey

101
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:37,079
instrument that we uh were planning to

102
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:39,038
use and we ended up moving completely

103
00:04:37,079 --> 00:04:42,319
away from surving tribal members in the

104
00:04:39,038 --> 00:04:44,079
end and just doing a depth qualitative

105
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:46,959
process through what we call talking

106
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:48,800
circles so similar to focus groups we

107
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:50,879
sat in circles and had conversations

108
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,720
around climate and those conversations

109
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:55,120
fed into our curriculum development

110
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:58,800
process we did three talking circles in

111
00:04:55,120 --> 00:05:03,478
the end one at um the Red Canyon poow in

112
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:06,680
Moab one um in a Hogan down in Blanding

113
00:05:03,478 --> 00:05:10,000
and another talking circle with

114
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:12,759
organizational Partners on zoom and um

115
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,959
and then also the Hogan talking Circle

116
00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:16,960
was with participants in a program

117
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:19,560
called Native American tribes upholding

118
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:21,839
restoration and education and we did a

119
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:25,478
first talking circle at the beginning of

120
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:28,279
our uh whole process down on their site

121
00:05:25,478 --> 00:05:31,719
where the program takes place in Beer's

122
00:05:28,279 --> 00:05:34,119
National Monument so four total but with

123
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:36,720
uh three different audiences if that

124
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:39,800
makes sense okay so those talking

125
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:41,199
circles um again that took quite a while

126
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:42,520
to build the relationships and I won't

127
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:45,199
go into depth here because I have just a

128
00:05:42,519 --> 00:05:47,680
handful of minutes but uh I will say

129
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:49,800
that we reached out to chapter houses on

130
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,800
the Navajo Nation to notify them of our

131
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:54,439
work and to the Navajo Nation

132
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:56,120
IRB and uh we didn't receive a response

133
00:05:54,439 --> 00:05:58,879
from the Navajo Nation IRB which we were

134
00:05:56,120 --> 00:06:01,000
told from some tribal members and on our

135
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:02,719
advisory Council that that couldn't um

136
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,639
actually be good news that there weren't

137
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:07,599
any red flags about the research but our

138
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:10,199
IRB was not happy with the fact we

139
00:06:07,598 --> 00:06:12,199
hadn't received notification for the nav

140
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:16,240
Nation IRB and it really delayed our

141
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:18,080
project and uh so early communication if

142
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:21,120
your the tribe you're working with has

143
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:22,598
an IRB is extremely important and um

144
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,759
building that I in hindsight I would

145
00:06:22,598 --> 00:06:25,800
have built that right at the beginning

146
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:29,598
of the grand application

147
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:32,160
process and um one thing that was a POS

148
00:06:29,598 --> 00:06:34,598
positive in the end unexpectedly is I

149
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:36,439
had already volunteered at the Red Sands

150
00:06:34,598 --> 00:06:37,959
Powwow in years past and so I had

151
00:06:36,439 --> 00:06:40,879
relationship with some of the staff

152
00:06:37,959 --> 00:06:43,399
there and that allowed us to conduct a

153
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:45,639
talking circle at the powwow but we also

154
00:06:43,399 --> 00:06:49,079
paid to table there so we contributed to

155
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:50,560
the event financially and um then we we

156
00:06:49,079 --> 00:06:55,560
conducted a talking circle on the side

157
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:57,839
of tabling an educational table so uh at

158
00:06:55,560 --> 00:07:00,280
first we launched a position to

159
00:06:57,839 --> 00:07:02,439
decolonize our instrument and everything

160
00:07:00,279 --> 00:07:05,038
uh as latinx and Indigenous at first I

161
00:07:02,439 --> 00:07:07,719
was going to look at both populations

162
00:07:05,038 --> 00:07:11,279
and um climate perceptions from

163
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:14,599
both and I learned that very few people

164
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:16,638
have um depth experience with both

165
00:07:14,598 --> 00:07:18,478
cultures there's a lot of differences

166
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:20,400
and so in hindsight I would have just

167
00:07:18,478 --> 00:07:22,399
advertised for an indigenous Community

168
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:24,478
coordinator instead of a latinx and

169
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:29,159
Indigenous uh and then hired someone

170
00:07:24,478 --> 00:07:32,079
else to do U the Latin U latinx side but

171
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:33,479
again lesson learned so we fast

172
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:36,519
forwarding through time we conduct our

173
00:07:33,478 --> 00:07:38,639
talking circles we transcribe uh code uh

174
00:07:36,519 --> 00:07:40,878
the results and we shared those back

175
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:44,038
immediately within two weeks with the

176
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:45,560
participants to do a reference check of

177
00:07:44,038 --> 00:07:48,038
the data make sure our interpretation

178
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:51,399
was accurate and then we created a

179
00:07:48,038 --> 00:07:53,719
handout that was really easy to read and

180
00:07:51,399 --> 00:07:55,959
Visually attractive that we administered

181
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:58,159
at the Red Sands powow and to our

182
00:07:55,959 --> 00:07:59,638
participants electronically to share

183
00:07:58,158 --> 00:08:02,240
about our takeaways from The Talk

184
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:04,240
circles major results after the talking

185
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,840
circles we hired three indigenous

186
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:08,000
participants who had engaged in the

187
00:08:05,839 --> 00:08:09,799
talking circles to co-create a climate

188
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,680
change curriculum with us for the Native

189
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:15,280
American tribes program at the beginning

190
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:17,560
of the Grant I had planned to uh launch

191
00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:18,878
my own program and then realized that

192
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:20,720
that would be in competition with an

193
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:22,639
already existing program within Beer's

194
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,159
National Monument so we partnered with

195
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:26,639
them instead and just strengthen their

196
00:08:24,158 --> 00:08:29,680
program through our research the three

197
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:32,599
indigenous um participants we hired we

198
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:35,000
um paid a thousand each to work with us

199
00:08:32,599 --> 00:08:36,680
over the course of several weeks to

200
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,759
co-create our climate change curriculum

201
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:40,679
we had weekly meetings and homework

202
00:08:38,759 --> 00:08:42,278
every week and then we would come back

203
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:46,239
and share our findings and our

204
00:08:42,278 --> 00:08:48,958
recommendations for the program and um

205
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:50,959
that resulted in a climate change module

206
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:53,000
that was de developed for the nature

207
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:56,159
program that's a menu approach where

208
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:59,000
people can sample um and take what they

209
00:08:56,159 --> 00:09:03,159
wanted to use in the program as a

210
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:05,879
speaker availability and um uh

211
00:09:03,159 --> 00:09:08,879
other uh considerations were taken into

212
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:10,720
effect so for example not every year

213
00:09:08,879 --> 00:09:13,159
potentially they could do a rafting trip

214
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,839
as part of the lesson plan but that the

215
00:09:13,159 --> 00:09:18,480
menu includes that as an

216
00:09:14,839 --> 00:09:19,800
option okay so um I'll just stop with

217
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,240
that since we only have three minutes

218
00:09:19,799 --> 00:09:23,199
left but I do want to share a couple

219
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:28,000
resources if you are interested in the

220
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:31,200
work that we did um I can share looks

221
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,399
like I didn't see anyone weigh in on the

222
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:36,480
question in the chat but I will share

223
00:09:33,399 --> 00:09:39,078
two Resources with you all one is the

224
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:42,000
handout that we gave to our participants

225
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:44,679
um to share back the data uh and the

226
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:47,320
other is that I'll share if I can share

227
00:09:44,679 --> 00:09:50,319
let me see if I can share this

228
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:50,320
handout

229
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:54,720
um oh shoot I can't share but let me

230
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:56,799
just share my screen real quick and I

231
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:59,120
will just show you what it looks like

232
00:09:56,799 --> 00:10:02,838
okay so this is the handout that we gave

233
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:04,519
to to um the community members and just

234
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:06,279
background on the study what was our

235
00:10:04,519 --> 00:10:09,839
objective being very transparent with

236
00:10:06,278 --> 00:10:12,639
what we did and very simplified results

237
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:14,760
take away from the talking circles some

238
00:10:12,639 --> 00:10:17,078
key quotes connecting climate change

239
00:10:14,759 --> 00:10:19,639
with capitalism Etc and then the climate

240
00:10:17,078 --> 00:10:22,078
change curriculum co-creation what did

241
00:10:19,639 --> 00:10:25,439
we do how did we do it and here is a

242
00:10:22,078 --> 00:10:28,838
sample of what the model or mod um menu

243
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:29,959
style approach included so if you want

244
00:10:28,839 --> 00:10:32,399
to

245
00:10:29,958 --> 00:10:34,679
receive a example of the depth

246
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:36,720
curriculum which is this the co-creative

247
00:10:34,679 --> 00:10:38,638
menu that we did with all of the

248
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:41,079
suggestions and the speakers and things

249
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:44,919
like that I'm happy to share that and

250
00:10:41,078 --> 00:10:46,759
just um we'll end by saying that the one

251
00:10:44,919 --> 00:10:48,799
that we developed included a lot more

252
00:10:46,759 --> 00:10:51,679
activism it included a lot more

253
00:10:48,799 --> 00:10:53,958
indigenous voices in the speakers and

254
00:10:51,679 --> 00:10:56,719
also movies and other things that were

255
00:10:53,958 --> 00:11:00,879
shared and uh it ended up with a much

256
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:03,278
more Diversified um menu of options for

257
00:11:00,879 --> 00:11:04,759
the program to use especially because

258
00:11:03,278 --> 00:11:07,278
it's a program that targets indigenous

259
00:11:04,759 --> 00:11:09,278
people that was important to our group

260
00:11:07,278 --> 00:11:12,120
so in that brief time we have one minute

261
00:11:09,278 --> 00:11:15,759
left I'll go ahead and wrap up and share

262
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:19,278

00:11:21,958 --> 00:11:26,399
through the Q&amp;A apparently the chat

266
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:28,799

to you

00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:12,440
directly and um I really do think it's

287
00:12:09,679 --> 00:12:14,039
important to uh you know be putting in

288
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:16,079
perspective how we reach out to

289
00:12:14,039 --> 00:12:17,838
communities I think to a large degree

290
00:12:16,078 --> 00:12:19,479
we're pretty decent at reaching out to

291
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:21,880
our individual communities in a lot of

292
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:25,839
ways but it's uh really important to be

293
00:12:21,879 --> 00:12:27,919
able to take into account all the

294
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:31,160
different I don't even know the proper

295
00:12:27,919 --> 00:12:33,919
words for it but all the different ways

296
00:12:31,159 --> 00:12:35,679
of communicating Styles as well as what

297
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:38,958
is important to our individual

298
00:12:35,679 --> 00:12:41,198
communities so um I really appreciate

299
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:41,198
your

300
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:47,839
talk this has been a production of

301
00:12:44,919 --> 00:12:50,838
Corell University on the web at

302
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:50,839
cornell.edu
