1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:04,280
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:06,559 --> 00:00:10,879
University I feel very fortunate to be

3
00:00:08,919 --> 00:00:13,480
here this time of year um itha is

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:15,719
beautiful and um it's my pleasure to

5
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:17,480
talk about palms um I'm gonna I titled

6
00:00:15,718 --> 00:00:20,759
this talk integrative studies in Palms I

7
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:23,760
don't just do field um research in Palms

8
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:25,240
but it is my um group of focus and I

9
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,720
hope after this talk you'll feel

10
00:00:25,239 --> 00:00:30,640
motivated to at least explore some

11
00:00:27,719 --> 00:00:33,920
aspects of this fascinating group

12
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:36,280
I use Palms to um navigate the time

13
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:38,160
scales time scales I would say my Bas is

14
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:40,600
in population phylogenomics and

15
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:43,558
population ecology but I work with

16
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:45,640
geologists to um in products about geog

17
00:00:43,558 --> 00:00:47,479
genomics historical demography

18
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:49,480
biogeography and with chemical

19
00:00:47,479 --> 00:00:52,959
ecologists and entomologists on the

20
00:00:49,479 --> 00:00:54,479
reproductive Ecology of palms and I Tred

21
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,799
to make all of this information

22
00:00:54,479 --> 00:01:00,358
available for conservation plans for

23
00:00:56,799 --> 00:01:00,358
endangered species

24
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:04,040
so I'm going to introduce the Palm

25
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:06,040
family at least the relevant aspects of

26
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:08,759
the family and then talk about three of

27
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:10,799
the topics I've addressed and um even

28
00:01:08,759 --> 00:01:14,519
some of the current work I'm doing not

29
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:16,118
of all of it is finished and um talk a

30
00:01:14,519 --> 00:01:18,478
little bit about the future and leave

31
00:01:16,118 --> 00:01:21,599
some time for

32
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:24,679
questions so this family it's a

33
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:27,000
well-known pretty famous family I'd say

34
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:29,920
so most of you I'm sure know it's a

35
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,840
mainly tropical family um some speci

36
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,759
species are

37
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:35,280
subtropical but diversity isn't evenly

38
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:37,519
distributed through the world so there's

39
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,840
two diversity centers Northwestern and

40
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:42,078
South

41
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:45,920
America so here and then southeast Asia

42
00:01:42,078 --> 00:01:49,559
it includes 2,600 species and 188

43
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:51,159
Genera and it has evolved over a 100

44
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:54,799
million

45
00:01:51,159 --> 00:01:57,520
years and in general Palms like or Palms

46
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:59,360
are adapted to warm environments so high

47
00:01:57,519 --> 00:02:02,399
mean annual temperatures low

48
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:05,438
temperatures seasonality and the coldest

49
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:08,038
month has to be above five Celsius

50
00:02:05,438 --> 00:02:11,919
because they can't really cope with

51
00:02:08,038 --> 00:02:14,878
frost some very interesting um aspect

52
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:18,000
about palms is that they can be very

53
00:02:14,878 --> 00:02:20,399
abundant so in Amazonian Forest where

54
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,439
this study was done taking data from all

55
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:25,120
of these plots in

56
00:02:22,439 --> 00:02:27,318
Amazonia um they list the 20 most

57
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:30,120
abundant frequent tree Palms are not

58
00:02:27,318 --> 00:02:33,199
trees but tree like trees um in the

59
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:35,560
Amazonian Basin and seven of them seven

60
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:40,079
of the 20 are palms and the most

61
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:41,959
abundant tree like stem is er precatoria

62
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:46,040
which is the as palm so they're

63
00:02:41,959 --> 00:02:46,039
structurally very important for tropical

64
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:52,439
ecosystems however we found that in many

65
00:02:49,639 --> 00:02:53,318
cases this extreme abundance that leads

66
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:56,560
to

67
00:02:53,318 --> 00:02:58,598
monodominance is related to disturbance

68
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:01,319
to human disturbance in many cases this

69
00:02:58,598 --> 00:03:04,399
has led to the the hypothesis of of

70
00:03:01,318 --> 00:03:07,839
Amazonia as planted Forest where these

71
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:09,640
um forests are enriched with species by

72
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:12,200
human management of of the of these

73
00:03:09,639 --> 00:03:14,639
forests this was certainly the case for

74
00:03:12,199 --> 00:03:17,399
serilon where we worked in these um

75
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:19,919
Central cordigera in the Andes and in

76
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:23,039
other spots along the tropical

77
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:25,280
Andes even if they're very abundant very

78
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:27,840
frequent there's still discoveries being

79
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:30,680
made so new species being described this

80
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,319
is one of last year's gems um it looks

81
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:35,480
like a very ordinary palem when you look

82
00:03:32,318 --> 00:03:38,719
at it very ordinary under story palem

83
00:03:35,479 --> 00:03:40,878
but because of um n people local people

84
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:43,680
living around these forests that led to

85
00:03:40,878 --> 00:03:46,878
the discovery that well actually the

86
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:49,239
fruits are foraged on by Wild boes and

87
00:03:46,878 --> 00:03:51,518
the flowers are underground we don't

88
00:03:49,239 --> 00:03:53,840
know who pollinates these palms and this

89
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:56,360
just highlights the importance of

90
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:58,079
working with people around biodiversity

91
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:01,959
because they know a lot more about the

92
00:03:58,079 --> 00:04:04,519
natural history of species around

93
00:04:01,959 --> 00:04:06,799
them perhaps because they're so abundant

94
00:04:04,519 --> 00:04:10,120
and structurally important people from

95
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:12,239
the tropics use them in many ways so to

96
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:14,000
build their homes this is the inside of

97
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:16,840
a home and you can see the floors the

98
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,040
walls made OFA Del

99
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:21,679
toi the

100
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:25,000
roofs in the entire

101
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:29,240
homes fences these are just some

102
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:32,000
examples elevated Gardens ratina caler a

103
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:33,439
beautiful bomb stairs to climb up to

104
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,199
those

105
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:39,800
Gardens and even what's in used inside

106
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:43,840
homes so this is a part of a broom being

107
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:45,680
made so brooms and even what's eaten

108
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:48,560
inside of those homes so this is the

109
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:51,478
peach Palm a wonderful source of many

110
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:54,120
nutrients for many Community communities

111
00:04:51,478 --> 00:04:56,879
in the American Tropics so it is of no

112
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:59,038
surprise that Palms are named in just

113
00:04:56,879 --> 00:05:01,240
every culture in just every language

114
00:04:59,038 --> 00:05:04,360
these are non-spanish names for the

115
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:06,319
peach balm in the Colombian Amazonian so

116
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:08,280
you can see you'll sign you'll find some

117
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:10,759
similarities between these words because

118
00:05:08,279 --> 00:05:12,638
some of these languages are related but

119
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:14,840
because they're so important and so used

120
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:18,360
so fundamental for human livelihoods

121
00:05:14,839 --> 00:05:18,359
they have a name they're

122
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:25,000
named so this is the tropical an example

123
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:27,639
of a tropical home this is very common

124
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,519
and Palms are everywhere in the tropical

125
00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:32,439
home

126
00:05:30,519 --> 00:05:34,799
however we're losing forests and without

127
00:05:32,439 --> 00:05:37,478
forests we lose this backup resource for

128
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:39,600
Rural communities and this also this

129
00:05:37,478 --> 00:05:41,120
incredible opportunity to learn from

130
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:45,759
Palms

131
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:48,439
so this is um even more concerning given

132
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:50,919
their conservation state so in this

133
00:05:48,439 --> 00:05:54,600
study 80% of the world uh Palms were

134
00:05:50,918 --> 00:05:57,359
studied and 56% of them were found U

135
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:59,639
were in some endangerment category

136
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:02,120
regardless of the method used to class

137
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:04,680
CL ify them so the red triangles and

138
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:06,639
then the bars they're showing different

139
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:08,639
methods you always have a high

140
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:10,400
percentage of the threatened species and

141
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:13,439
they fall in many categories whether

142
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:15,120
it's evolutionary distinct species um

143
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:17,719
functionally distinct species that are

144
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:21,120
not replaceable or they're used by

145
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:23,720
humans in for culture food utensils

146
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:26,399
medicine so regardless of their category

147
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:29,919
you always find some large percentage of

148
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:31,598
the species endangered and

149
00:06:29,918 --> 00:06:34,959
this is worse for the regions having

150
00:06:31,598 --> 00:06:37,519
over 10 um species so the species rich

151
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:39,638
areas in the world have higher

152
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:42,560
endangerment and this is the areas where

153
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:42,560
people rely on them

154
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:49,639
most so my research addresses the

155
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:52,599
general overarching question of how do

156
00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:54,639
species and populations persist in time

157
00:06:52,598 --> 00:06:56,639
and what they can teach us about their

158
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:58,960
changing environments this would be like

159
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:01,519
their the overarching question and of

160
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:03,878
course with a focus on on

161
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:06,399
Palms so I'll talk a little bit about my

162
00:07:03,879 --> 00:07:06,400
research

163
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:12,680
now so I've always been intrigued by

164
00:07:10,918 --> 00:07:15,159
elevational gradients if you've worked

165
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:17,478
in the tropics you can perceive the high

166
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:19,039
turnover from elevation gradients

167
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:21,079
they're absolutely

168
00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:24,159
interesting they're very variable

169
00:07:21,079 --> 00:07:26,800
between different slopes and different

170
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:28,840
mountains and particularly more so

171
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,680
because elevation gradients offer

172
00:07:28,839 --> 00:07:32,878
climatic gradient that go along with

173
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:36,000
them and because Palms are so well

174
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:38,319
adapted to warmer conditions it's very

175
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,839
striking that some groups are adapted to

176
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:43,479
cool environments from the highlands and

177
00:07:40,839 --> 00:07:47,239
this particular genus hyanis it includes

178
00:07:43,478 --> 00:07:50,839
35 species and they live from zero MERS

179
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:54,720
above sea level in mangroves to 3,200

180
00:07:50,839 --> 00:07:58,318
meters above sea level close to the tree

181
00:07:54,720 --> 00:08:00,280
line so we wanted to understand how this

182
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:03,120
adaptation to cool habit

183
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:04,559
evolves in their philogyny so we built

184
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,959
different phylogenies with different

185
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:09,800
data sets we had Sanger sequences but we

186
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:12,318
also put together this phogy based on

187
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:14,240
hybrid capture using 4,000 nuclear

188
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:16,960
coding and non-coding regions this is

189
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:18,759
the summarized species tree asteral tree

190
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:21,598
and I've colored the

191
00:08:18,759 --> 00:08:25,680
clades and what this shows you is that

192
00:08:21,598 --> 00:08:27,719
all clades so each Clay is a color and

193
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:31,158
what you can see is all clades have

194
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:33,278
evolved to live or to cover the

195
00:08:31,158 --> 00:08:35,519
elevation gradient so every single clay

196
00:08:33,278 --> 00:08:38,080
repeatedly has a species that lives in

197
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:39,839
warmer conditions mid elevations and

198
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,479
high elevations and this happens

199
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:44,279
repeatedly for every

200
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:45,920
CA and indeed when you look at

201
00:08:44,278 --> 00:08:48,399
temperature related variables here

202
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:50,000
indicated by principal components or

203
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:51,919
temperat or precipitation related

204
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,559
variables you see the precipitation

205
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:55,759
related variables have higher

206
00:08:53,559 --> 00:08:57,319
philogenetic signal whereas temperature

207
00:08:55,759 --> 00:09:01,319
related variables do not because they

208
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:01,320
flip and flop around branches

209
00:09:01,799 --> 00:09:05,479
so this is the model that explains how

210
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:07,800
these are evolving so the different

211
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:10,360
clades basically have species covering

212
00:09:07,799 --> 00:09:13,078
the entire gradient and adaptation to

213
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:15,600
different temperature uh temperatures

214
00:09:13,078 --> 00:09:17,838
can evolve in all of these clayes

215
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:20,240
however this all happens by conserved

216
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:23,399
low precipitation seasonality so these

217
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:25,440
Palms can evolve if there's still low

218
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:27,519
precipitation seasonality and this

219
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:30,519
indicates a little bit about what would

220
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:32,679
be a big threat um to their future

221
00:09:30,519 --> 00:09:35,440
because they can't really cope with high

222
00:09:32,679 --> 00:09:37,799
higher seasonality whereas they can seem

223
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:40,800
they seem to do well in many different

224
00:09:37,799 --> 00:09:43,159
temperatures so this has allowed um

225
00:09:40,799 --> 00:09:45,159
complexes like this Ian sua that we've

226
00:09:43,159 --> 00:09:47,679
been studying and that we're continuing

227
00:09:45,159 --> 00:09:50,078
to sample to cover the elevation

228
00:09:47,679 --> 00:09:51,838
gradient you have species you have

229
00:09:50,078 --> 00:09:54,559
populations at the tree line and

230
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:56,600
populations by the Sea and we're trying

231
00:09:54,559 --> 00:09:58,879
to we want to understand what the

232
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:01,800
differen is in um populations at

233
00:09:58,879 --> 00:10:03,720
different environments can tell us about

234
00:10:01,799 --> 00:10:05,919
adaptation to different

235
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:08,759
climates another group I've been I've

236
00:10:05,919 --> 00:10:13,278
studied for years Chelsea mentioned it

237
00:10:08,759 --> 00:10:15,078
is ceroxylon the wax BMS they're very

238
00:10:13,278 --> 00:10:17,439
fascinating because they live in extreme

239
00:10:15,078 --> 00:10:20,199
environment for Palms they live in high

240
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:22,360
elevation forests cool forests that are

241
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:25,000
covered constantly covered by mist and

242
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:27,278
clouds so this is Extreme for Palms

243
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,600
they're also dious so they have female

244
00:10:27,278 --> 00:10:31,559
and male flowers and they're only

245
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:34,000
slightly dimorphic so you'll see this is

246
00:10:31,559 --> 00:10:36,799
the female flowers and the male flowers

247
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,278
um they're very similar but the male

248
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:41,799
flowers are just slightly drooping and

249
00:10:39,278 --> 00:10:45,278
they can reach to 3,500 meters above sea

250
00:10:41,799 --> 00:10:48,000
level which is 1,500 feet so very high

251
00:10:45,278 --> 00:10:50,360
in the mountains for Palms at

252
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,559
least we wanted to understand how are

253
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:54,320
these populations making it how are they

254
00:10:52,559 --> 00:10:57,399
persisting in such an extreme

255
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:59,839
environments and more so because we

256
00:10:57,399 --> 00:11:01,519
sometimes find congenerics Co existing

257
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:06,600
within the same Forest so you even find

258
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:09,159
copy in these um extreme groups so we

259
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:12,320
followed a forest that had three

260
00:11:09,159 --> 00:11:14,559
different species from ceroxylon um

261
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:17,680
living together so ceroxylon farrons in

262
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:20,319
the middle and ventriosum the left and

263
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:23,759
velum and you find viable populations of

264
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:24,760
all three living together at 3,200 MERS

265
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:28,519
above sea

266
00:11:24,759 --> 00:11:30,319
level we followed their flower visitors

267
00:11:28,519 --> 00:11:33,560
and their technology for three

268
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:37,600
consecutive years every month and we

269
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:40,199
found that 50 morphos species 50 insects

270
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:42,759
visit all of the three species we found

271
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:45,278
no differences between the three of them

272
00:11:42,759 --> 00:11:48,519
but the effective pollination services

273
00:11:45,278 --> 00:11:51,278
are mainly carried out by Mists rotunda

274
00:11:48,519 --> 00:11:53,799
which is this small miniature

275
00:11:51,278 --> 00:11:56,919
Beetle and this is how it goes so the

276
00:11:53,799 --> 00:11:59,838
male infloresence emits these um alkanes

277
00:11:56,919 --> 00:12:02,360
the aliphatic compounds and they attract

278
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:04,480
the The Beetles they come by swarms they

279
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:06,278
feed on the pollen then they maintain

280
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,560
the infloresence but then they're

281
00:12:06,278 --> 00:12:10,759
attracted to the female INF

282
00:12:07,559 --> 00:12:12,439
fluorescences by the same scent but then

283
00:12:10,759 --> 00:12:14,319
it's by deceit right because they arrive

284
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:16,240
at the female inflorescences and there's

285
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:18,800
nothing to feed on there but then they

286
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,799
pollinate the

287
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:24,160
flowers and this beetle is important in

288
00:12:22,198 --> 00:12:26,278
the pollination of all three species

289
00:12:24,159 --> 00:12:28,679
which are closely related so we wanted

290
00:12:26,278 --> 00:12:29,799
to see how they would how they partition

291
00:12:28,679 --> 00:12:32,120
this resource

292
00:12:29,799 --> 00:12:34,278
and it's temporal partition which is

293
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:36,639
classical so we have the three species

294
00:12:34,278 --> 00:12:38,600
and three colors and this is the summary

295
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:41,320
of the three years and you can see they

296
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:44,800
have different flowering Peaks for male

297
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:49,160
inflorescences female inflorescences and

298
00:12:44,799 --> 00:12:51,519
fruits and flowering Peaks occur outside

299
00:12:49,159 --> 00:12:54,039
of the rainy season so here you see the

300
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:56,240
rainy season it's these yellow Peaks

301
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:58,719
that has probably to do with volatile

302
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:02,198
emission being more efficient during the

303
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:04,320
dryer um Seasons but we did find there's

304
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:06,479
some overlap between species so there's

305
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:09,480
the potential of pulling from species

306
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:12,240
one to end up in the stigmas of species

307
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:14,519
2 and because they're closely related we

308
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:17,600
had some questions about

309
00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:20,919
this but this system is highly efficient

310
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:22,879
so reproduction is uh phenomenal in the

311
00:13:20,919 --> 00:13:26,078
sense that the smaller species can

312
00:13:22,879 --> 00:13:29,120
produce 3,500 fruits per season and the

313
00:13:26,078 --> 00:13:31,879
larger species ventriosum 10,500 fruits

314
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:34,839
fruits um and these fruits feed tucans

315
00:13:31,879 --> 00:13:36,838
toucanets green Jays

316
00:13:34,839 --> 00:13:39,519
um

317
00:13:36,839 --> 00:13:41,839
parrots and this even happens in areas

318
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:44,078
that have been deforested so we've also

319
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:46,760
worked in this other site the tesito

320
00:13:44,078 --> 00:13:50,359
valley which has been Disturbed as you

321
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:52,278
can see and every season during masting

322
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:55,519
season and non-masing Seasons there's

323
00:13:52,278 --> 00:13:59,120
efficient reproduction so we think this

324
00:13:55,519 --> 00:14:02,440
this these three species at least are a

325
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,440
fundamental habitat for the

326
00:14:03,559 --> 00:14:09,399
Beatles so we had some questions after

327
00:14:06,278 --> 00:14:12,919
having done this work um these three

328
00:14:09,399 --> 00:14:15,759
species are taxonomically very um easy

329
00:14:12,919 --> 00:14:18,519
to identify even from Far So This is

330
00:14:15,759 --> 00:14:20,240
velum and this is ventriosum and with

331
00:14:18,519 --> 00:14:22,078
very little training you can tell them

332
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:25,440
apart even from the distance so they're

333
00:14:22,078 --> 00:14:27,479
taxonomically good species and they're

334
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,920
they're different they're the same in

335
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:31,320
every single population where you visit

336
00:14:28,919 --> 00:14:33,639
them so if you collect ventriosum in

337
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:36,278
Ecuador or in Colombia they're exactly

338
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:38,720
the same in parront in Bolivia or

339
00:14:36,278 --> 00:14:42,198
Colombia they're so there's um they're

340
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:44,120
clear species and taxonomically but are

341
00:14:42,198 --> 00:14:45,679
they really genetically isolated because

342
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:48,919
they have these overlapping flowering

343
00:14:45,679 --> 00:14:51,799
Peaks and they share the main pollinator

344
00:14:48,919 --> 00:14:54,439
and if there is Gene sharing is it

345
00:14:51,799 --> 00:14:55,838
adaptive so we sampled populations all

346
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:58,519
throughout their

347
00:14:55,839 --> 00:15:00,920
range so these populations are patchy

348
00:14:58,519 --> 00:15:03,560
you have some scattered individuals we

349
00:15:00,919 --> 00:15:06,599
wanted to at least sample all of the

350
00:15:03,559 --> 00:15:08,919
patch population patches we sampled all

351
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:11,278
but one species that was more recently

352
00:15:08,919 --> 00:15:13,399
described with emphasis on the Highland

353
00:15:11,278 --> 00:15:15,799
species complex which is a monoptic

354
00:15:13,399 --> 00:15:17,559
complex and there some sometimes they

355
00:15:15,799 --> 00:15:20,240
sometimes um live in

356
00:15:17,559 --> 00:15:21,559
sympatry and we use this same genomic

357
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:24,079
data

358
00:15:21,559 --> 00:15:27,198
set so these are the Highland species

359
00:15:24,078 --> 00:15:29,399
you have velano and green and parron and

360
00:15:27,198 --> 00:15:32,439
you see it's highly overlapped and then

361
00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:35,360
you have this h w ventriosum

362
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:38,440
kind they kind of replace each other

363
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:40,120
altitudinally latitudinally sorry and

364
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:43,079
they all live at the same elevation

365
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:45,240
between 2,00 and 3,500 uh meters above

366
00:15:43,078 --> 00:15:48,719
sea level and this is the underlying

367
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:51,000
cartoon philogyny for the

368
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:53,680
species and what we found is that we

369
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:57,039
have pure individuals for parron and

370
00:15:53,679 --> 00:15:59,638
pure individuals for KYW but then cenum

371
00:15:57,039 --> 00:16:02,639
and ventriosum in dark blue here far

372
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:06,000
every they fall everywhere in between

373
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:08,480
this hybrid index is AD mixture based so

374
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:11,958
this led to the idea that we have really

375
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:14,199
three species and then two introgress

376
00:16:11,958 --> 00:16:16,838
forms that we've been calling in

377
00:16:14,198 --> 00:16:19,120
taxonomy ventriosum and cerum but

378
00:16:16,839 --> 00:16:21,600
they're actually just admixed forms of

379
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:24,679
the other three species when you bring

380
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:27,959
genetic data for all three species velum

381
00:16:24,679 --> 00:16:31,958
HW and parbon shown by this triangular

382
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:34,958
um graphs you find some pure populations

383
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:36,719
in the corners but then you find indeed

384
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:40,119
ventricosum and cerum right in the

385
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:42,399
middle so they're basically have shared

386
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:43,399
um they're they're sharing genes with

387
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:45,958
all three

388
00:16:43,399 --> 00:16:47,720
species which we could understand

389
00:16:45,958 --> 00:16:49,318
through what we knew from their

390
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:52,040
reproductive

391
00:16:49,318 --> 00:16:54,120
ecology because ad mixture based methods

392
00:16:52,039 --> 00:16:56,679
aren't enough to detect hybridization or

393
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:59,839
introgressive hybridization we also use

394
00:16:56,679 --> 00:17:01,519
these statistics or ABAB Baba statistics

395
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:04,400
um which is the proportion of derived

396
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:08,120
versus ancestral alal sites for ABA and

397
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:10,959
Baba patterns and what we find and then

398
00:17:08,119 --> 00:17:14,639
the F F4 ratio which is an excess in

399
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:17,000
alal sharing so an excess of deep and

400
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:18,079
these larger circles are basically

401
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
showing you where there's more

402
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:23,159
ingression and we find that's

403
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:27,038
particularly so when we have farrons and

404
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:29,400
uh s which was our initial um

405
00:17:27,038 --> 00:17:31,879
observation from the field

406
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:34,320
and when you map those populations to

407
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:35,880
their geographical locations we find

408
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:38,119
that the pure populations are at the

409
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:41,080
center of their distribution whereas

410
00:17:38,119 --> 00:17:43,038
their um the most ad miixed populations

411
00:17:41,079 --> 00:17:44,918
are at the periphery of their entire

412
00:17:43,038 --> 00:17:46,919
distribution so you have the entire

413
00:17:44,919 --> 00:17:49,840
distribution and towards the margins is

414
00:17:46,919 --> 00:17:51,840
where you find the more introgressed

415
00:17:49,839 --> 00:17:54,798
populations we wanted to see if this

416
00:17:51,839 --> 00:17:59,399
introgressed regions um coincide or

417
00:17:54,798 --> 00:18:02,119
matched with um sites under selection

418
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:04,320
by these evolutionary models by Le and

419
00:18:02,119 --> 00:18:06,479
collaborators and we found that's rarely

420
00:18:04,319 --> 00:18:09,279
the case so interrest regions are

421
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:11,640
normally not under positive

422
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:15,279
selection and the way we understood this

423
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:18,320
is well we have three species that are

424
00:18:15,279 --> 00:18:20,079
that can share genes right but there are

425
00:18:18,319 --> 00:18:22,480
differences in the in the in their

426
00:18:20,079 --> 00:18:24,839
population sizes so we have two popul

427
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:27,038
two species with large populations and

428
00:18:24,839 --> 00:18:29,319
then one species with a very small

429
00:18:27,038 --> 00:18:32,319
population the species with the smaller

430
00:18:29,319 --> 00:18:34,279
population size will amplify the inest

431
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:36,839
regions because of drift and demographic

432
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:39,158
effects so this is called the Gen

433
00:18:36,839 --> 00:18:41,038
genomic neutralist hypothesis and it

434
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:42,559
just highlights the essential role of

435
00:18:41,038 --> 00:18:44,000
inefficient reproductive barriers

436
00:18:42,558 --> 00:18:45,480
they're sharing genes why because they

437
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:49,919
don't have efficient reproductive

438
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:51,679
barriers in place and this is Amplified

439
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:54,320
through demographic processes because

440
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:56,960
you have smaller populations in the

441
00:18:54,319 --> 00:18:58,839
periphery so as you move out of um the

442
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:00,440
center of their distribution populations

443
00:18:58,839 --> 00:19:02,918
become smaller and smaller and

444
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:04,919
individuals become sparer and sparer and

445
00:19:02,919 --> 00:19:06,960
though and thus these introgress regions

446
00:19:04,919 --> 00:19:09,360
can become more Amplified in the

447
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:11,480
receiving um

448
00:19:09,359 --> 00:19:14,399
population so this was interesting

449
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:17,599
because it also shows that for some of

450
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:20,280
these species a way of maintaining

451
00:19:17,599 --> 00:19:22,319
diversity levels is through Gene sharing

452
00:19:20,279 --> 00:19:24,399
specifically so in areas where

453
00:19:22,319 --> 00:19:26,678
populations are smaller and individuals

454
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:28,000
are more sparer so it's it highlights

455
00:19:26,679 --> 00:19:30,200
also the importance of having

456
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:33,038
congenerics in the same area it's not

457
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:35,000
just about protecting one wax Palm but

458
00:19:33,038 --> 00:19:37,558
all of the wax Palms that live together

459
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:39,519
in that Forest because they can

460
00:19:37,558 --> 00:19:42,639
potentially share

461
00:19:39,519 --> 00:19:45,279
genes okay now I'm going to talk about

462
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:48,400
geog genomics this is integrative work I

463
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:49,798
do with geologists I really enjoy doing

464
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,480
integrative work and working with

465
00:19:49,798 --> 00:19:54,279
geologists because I learn a lot from

466
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:56,679
them and I'm always amazed by the level

467
00:19:54,279 --> 00:19:59,079
of complexity of their work as

468
00:19:56,679 --> 00:20:02,440
well and doing fieldwork with them just

469
00:19:59,079 --> 00:20:04,079
shows you a whole different different

470
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:06,519
things that you wouldn't wouldn't have

471
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:08,038
looked at so it's been really good to

472
00:20:06,519 --> 00:20:11,679
work with

473
00:20:08,038 --> 00:20:14,279
them and with them we've been working on

474
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:17,159
the notion that the Andes although they

475
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:19,720
seem like a continuous 7,000 kilom

476
00:20:17,159 --> 00:20:22,000
mountain chain now they haven't always

477
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:24,759
been continuous in the past so they have

478
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:27,079
two different models for ndn evolution

479
00:20:24,759 --> 00:20:30,038
one is just a continuous chain that

480
00:20:27,079 --> 00:20:32,319
gradually um upad lift and then there's

481
00:20:30,038 --> 00:20:34,960
a second model where you have isolated

482
00:20:32,319 --> 00:20:37,240
mountains that form and then later

483
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:40,240
connect and these two scenarios offer

484
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:42,798
different evolutionary scenarios for for

485
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:44,919
for biot right if you have a continuous

486
00:20:42,798 --> 00:20:47,000
mountain chain then you can have

487
00:20:44,919 --> 00:20:49,120
dispersal occurring throughout time

488
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:51,359
whereas if you have uplift and then

489
00:20:49,119 --> 00:20:53,599
connection then dispersal of species

490
00:20:51,359 --> 00:20:57,359
should be episodic this should happen at

491
00:20:53,599 --> 00:21:02,038
a given time frame when the mountains

492
00:20:57,359 --> 00:21:04,079
connect and bird data um there's a lot

493
00:21:02,038 --> 00:21:06,759
of bird data and uh on the bird the

494
00:21:04,079 --> 00:21:08,639
distributions of birds so bird um

495
00:21:06,759 --> 00:21:11,278
coordinates bird occurrences have been

496
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:14,120
used to create this bio regions along

497
00:21:11,278 --> 00:21:15,960
the Andes for birds at least and you can

498
00:21:14,119 --> 00:21:19,839
see there's a lot of turnover if you

499
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:21,400
work in the um Andes one thing you will

500
00:21:19,839 --> 00:21:23,759
uh perceive is that there's a lot of

501
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:26,720
turnover and this is what this map is

502
00:21:23,759 --> 00:21:29,079
showing from bird occurrence data within

503
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:32,240
short distances you have turn over of

504
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:35,240
species and even philogenetic

505
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:38,919
breaks so we wanted to study these

506
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:41,519
philogenetic um dat phog genetic breaks

507
00:21:38,919 --> 00:21:44,120
sorry and we wanted to study that um

508
00:21:41,519 --> 00:21:46,839
with geologists using a group that is

509
00:21:44,119 --> 00:21:48,119
widely distributed and across the

510
00:21:46,839 --> 00:21:52,000
different

511
00:21:48,119 --> 00:21:53,759
brakes so we use Geon data which

512
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,720
includes different names it's more of

513
00:21:53,759 --> 00:21:57,640
like a

514
00:21:54,720 --> 00:22:00,360
complex it's a complex because it's very

515
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:04,440
morphologically variable so you have you

516
00:22:00,359 --> 00:22:07,240
have the very small um adults that's an

517
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:09,919
adult you can't really see here but

518
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:12,720
that's the infloresence is is here so

519
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:15,360
this is a meter tall adult but you also

520
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:18,640
have taller adults and the pine the leaf

521
00:22:15,359 --> 00:22:21,399
segments can look many different ways so

522
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:23,880
we've um described this whole complex as

523
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:25,960
a hyper cryptic radiation it includes

524
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:29,240
many genetic groups and very complicated

525
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:32,360
morphology but they do grow across these

526
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:34,200
breaks so we sampled them in different

527
00:22:32,359 --> 00:22:36,399
in all of the populations we found

528
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:40,200
through the Andes of

529
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:43,440
Colombia from the sier Santa Marta here

530
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:45,319
and into the Eastern Corda Central and

531
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:47,360
Western Corda and the What's called the

532
00:22:45,319 --> 00:22:49,720
Colombian Massif and we found there's

533
00:22:47,359 --> 00:22:52,599
four genetic groups and these four

534
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:54,679
genetic groups when uh working on their

535
00:22:52,599 --> 00:22:57,639
distribution with geologists we found

536
00:22:54,679 --> 00:23:02,559
these uh genetic breaks coincide with

537
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:04,559
the main faults of um that occur within

538
00:23:02,558 --> 00:23:06,720
within these areas and why are faults

539
00:23:04,558 --> 00:23:09,519
interesting to us because of mountains

540
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:12,319
were segmented if mountains were uh

541
00:23:09,519 --> 00:23:14,278
formed by different uh Mountain segments

542
00:23:12,319 --> 00:23:16,879
that only later reconnect they would

543
00:23:14,278 --> 00:23:19,079
have been broken or segmented along

544
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:22,320
these fault lines because topography

545
00:23:19,079 --> 00:23:24,960
doesn't grow in the same way in in in

546
00:23:22,319 --> 00:23:27,839
along faults than non- faulted areas so

547
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:30,600
you would have differences in relief

548
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:32,879
just along these

549
00:23:30,599 --> 00:23:34,959
lines and when you look at those genetic

550
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:36,720
groups basically they're they occupy the

551
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:38,919
same climatic space in terms of

552
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:41,600
temperature and precipitation you can

553
00:23:38,919 --> 00:23:43,320
see it in on both of these pcas but also

554
00:23:41,599 --> 00:23:45,558
here all of these genetic groups

555
00:23:43,319 --> 00:23:48,038
basically occupy the same climatic space

556
00:23:45,558 --> 00:23:50,038
but if you take morphological traits and

557
00:23:48,038 --> 00:23:53,599
you map all of the genetic groups

558
00:23:50,038 --> 00:23:55,440
together they overlap but if you if you

559
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:56,879
take the sympatric groups there does

560
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:59,400
seem to be some morphological

561
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:01,440
displacement so if groups are Sy Patric

562
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:03,720
they have displaced

563
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:06,919
morphologies if they're allopatric then

564
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:09,079
they overlap in terms of

565
00:24:06,919 --> 00:24:10,559
morphology we wanted to see if these

566
00:24:09,079 --> 00:24:12,480
sites

567
00:24:10,558 --> 00:24:16,440
um

568
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:19,319
under these fstd outliers for higher

569
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:22,000
Divergence uh Tajima the outliers which

570
00:24:19,319 --> 00:24:24,158
were showing us drift and uh population

571
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,480
reductions and sites under positive

572
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:28,120
selection if they mapped to the same

573
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:30,880
sites in the in the genome so these are

574
00:24:28,119 --> 00:24:34,278
the chromosomes and what we find is that

575
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:38,679
they don't so they rarely overlap it's

576
00:24:34,278 --> 00:24:38,679
so few sites are under Divergence and

577
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:45,558
selection except two genes that play a

578
00:24:42,319 --> 00:24:48,079
role in flowering times so again no

579
00:24:45,558 --> 00:24:50,678
surprise groups are um flowering times

580
00:24:48,079 --> 00:24:52,398
are playing an important role and then

581
00:24:50,679 --> 00:24:53,320
response to environment so chill and

582
00:24:52,398 --> 00:24:55,719
light

583
00:24:53,319 --> 00:24:57,398
responses so what's the role of faults

584
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:58,919
then right because we we had been

585
00:24:57,398 --> 00:25:01,239
working with geologist

586
00:24:58,919 --> 00:25:04,080
so what we think is this this uh these

587
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:07,079
faults create initial uh vicariance so

588
00:25:04,079 --> 00:25:09,119
initial allopatry but then there's these

589
00:25:07,079 --> 00:25:12,639
Divergence between groups is reinforced

590
00:25:09,119 --> 00:25:14,119
by drift and by in parallel to

591
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:16,640
morphological displacement and

592
00:25:14,119 --> 00:25:16,639
phological

593
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:22,360
displacement all right so we had this

594
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:24,759
system where we were thinking about

595
00:25:22,359 --> 00:25:27,479
ambient segmentation the geologists were

596
00:25:24,759 --> 00:25:29,278
sampling um and we were trying to

597
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:31,759
understand if they had been continuous

598
00:25:29,278 --> 00:25:33,519
or not and what plants were showing us

599
00:25:31,759 --> 00:25:35,119
right because we want to we want plants

600
00:25:33,519 --> 00:25:38,158
to inform us about their changing

601
00:25:35,119 --> 00:25:40,519
environments and we had the bird Maps we

602
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:43,159
had our genetic groups for

603
00:25:40,519 --> 00:25:46,278
geonoma and this wonderful paper came

604
00:25:43,159 --> 00:25:48,840
out um it's a p geographical

605
00:25:46,278 --> 00:25:51,919
reconstruction of that particular area

606
00:25:48,839 --> 00:25:54,798
where we had found um group turnover

607
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:57,799
genetic group turnover and in this

608
00:25:54,798 --> 00:26:00,480
particular area there's what was called

609
00:25:57,798 --> 00:26:03,639
the trans indan portal which connected

610
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:05,599
the Amazonian um Basin with the Pacific

611
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:08,240
so this might seem like a small thing

612
00:26:05,599 --> 00:26:12,359
but it's actually huge it's the uh

613
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:14,640
greatest rainforest connected to the uh

614
00:26:12,359 --> 00:26:16,479
Pacific which means the two most two of

615
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:18,919
the most plant diverse regions

616
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:21,159
connecting through this low paath um

617
00:26:18,919 --> 00:26:24,600
area where the Andes weren't high enough

618
00:26:21,159 --> 00:26:26,840
to um isolate species and this occurred

619
00:26:24,599 --> 00:26:29,639
until six million years ago so it was

620
00:26:26,839 --> 00:26:31,720
late Meine which would have affected the

621
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:34,679
distribution of many

622
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:39,480
species so we used our our data set from

623
00:26:34,679 --> 00:26:41,278
ceroxylon we had um sampling set from

624
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:43,038
all of the Andes and across the

625
00:26:41,278 --> 00:26:46,519
Transcendent

626
00:26:43,038 --> 00:26:48,960
portal we built several philogen again

627
00:26:46,519 --> 00:26:50,480
and um we use biogeo bears for

628
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:53,038
biogeographical

629
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:56,360
reconstructions and indeed we did found

630
00:26:53,038 --> 00:26:59,200
we did find that wax Palms were in the

631
00:26:56,359 --> 00:27:01,000
Andes since the Meine so

632
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:03,200
they were already there since the late

633
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:05,720
myos scene but they were there south of

634
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:10,038
Ecuador so in Bolivia Peru and

635
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:12,839
Ecuador and it was only in the PLO scene

636
00:27:10,038 --> 00:27:16,200
that they could disperse into the

637
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:17,839
Eastern cordetta of Colombia and only

638
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:19,278
between three and two million years that

639
00:27:17,839 --> 00:27:22,398
they could disperse into the Central and

640
00:27:19,278 --> 00:27:25,240
Western Corda so it was episodic and it

641
00:27:22,398 --> 00:27:27,079
was late so dispersal was not continuous

642
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:30,159
throughout their history all of the

643
00:27:27,079 --> 00:27:32,639
Highland clades repeatedly dispersed to

644
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:35,278
this area at the same time except this

645
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:37,120
lowland Group which is not indicative of

646
00:27:35,278 --> 00:27:40,880
Highland continuity

647
00:27:37,119 --> 00:27:42,719
right so we went out with geologists and

648
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:45,320
well you can't really see too much here

649
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:47,360
I see it there but um this is a map of

650
00:27:45,319 --> 00:27:51,359
that area in southern Colombia where the

651
00:27:47,359 --> 00:27:53,759
trans Indian portal was and we sampled

652
00:27:51,359 --> 00:27:57,678
all of this area with so it's like a 3

653
00:27:53,759 --> 00:27:59,480
degree longitude and latitude um area

654
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:02,200
and we with geologists and we found

655
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:06,839
these inites which are rocks that are

656
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:09,519
ejected by High um by large volcanic

657
00:28:06,839 --> 00:28:12,319
eruptions Caldera forming um

658
00:28:09,519 --> 00:28:15,200
volcanoes and they're thrown and you can

659
00:28:12,319 --> 00:28:18,359
date when they were um when they made

660
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:20,640
surface through geochronology which is

661
00:28:18,359 --> 00:28:22,798
basically uranium to lead decay in a

662
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:24,640
mineral called ziron and with this you

663
00:28:22,798 --> 00:28:26,359
can know the age of the Rocks when this

664
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:29,278
volcanic eruption

665
00:28:26,359 --> 00:28:31,199
occurred and interesting ly they were

666
00:28:29,278 --> 00:28:34,000
all they all the all of these rocks were

667
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:36,319
ejected in a very large perimeter in a

668
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,798
very large area uh which I'm showing

669
00:28:36,319 --> 00:28:40,678
here by the the

670
00:28:37,798 --> 00:28:43,119
degrees between two and three million

671
00:28:40,679 --> 00:28:44,880
years so it's exactly at the same age

672
00:28:43,119 --> 00:28:47,518
and not only did we find evidence for

673
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:50,080
this large scale volcanic eruption we

674
00:28:47,519 --> 00:28:54,480
also found that these um volcanoes are

675
00:28:50,079 --> 00:28:57,158
capable of producing um lava flows that

676
00:28:54,480 --> 00:29:00,720
can fill up low valleys to one kilometer

677
00:28:57,159 --> 00:29:02,840
in uh um deep so if you have a low paath

678
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:04,679
but then you have a large scale magmatic

679
00:29:02,839 --> 00:29:07,359
addition which can fill up the low

680
00:29:04,679 --> 00:29:10,038
valley then you can connect Mountain

681
00:29:07,359 --> 00:29:11,759
segments this is added to bulging and

682
00:29:10,038 --> 00:29:14,599
other processes that occur along with

683
00:29:11,759 --> 00:29:17,119
volcanism so our paleogeographical model

684
00:29:14,599 --> 00:29:19,079
is basically you did have Highlands

685
00:29:17,119 --> 00:29:21,158
before 5 million years you did have

686
00:29:19,079 --> 00:29:23,759
mountains but they weren't connected and

687
00:29:21,159 --> 00:29:26,399
through volcanism across these centers

688
00:29:23,759 --> 00:29:28,359
you would have um magmatic additions

689
00:29:26,398 --> 00:29:30,319
that basically connected segments and

690
00:29:28,359 --> 00:29:32,158
allowed species to disperse in this

691
00:29:30,319 --> 00:29:34,278
particular time

692
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:37,440
windows so because we had worked with

693
00:29:34,278 --> 00:29:40,640
faulting and volcanoes we teamed up with

694
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:42,480
um bird researchers whoa where we're

695
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:44,759
going with bird researchers who were

696
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:48,038
working on this hybrid Zone in the same

697
00:29:44,759 --> 00:29:50,278
volcanic area volcanic Center and we

698
00:29:48,038 --> 00:29:54,240
wrote this uh perspective which

699
00:29:50,278 --> 00:29:57,398
basically ties geological processes to

700
00:29:54,240 --> 00:30:00,319
um life Evolution processes so cortex

701
00:29:57,398 --> 00:30:03,599
bulging Valley filling lava flows Terra

702
00:30:00,319 --> 00:30:06,278
Falls gas and aerosol emissions to

703
00:30:03,599 --> 00:30:09,038
diversification Extinction and dispersal

704
00:30:06,278 --> 00:30:10,919
across different time scales so this is

705
00:30:09,038 --> 00:30:13,440
just to bring together processes in the

706
00:30:10,919 --> 00:30:17,159
geosciences and in the Life Sciences

707
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:17,159
which is what geog genomics

708
00:30:17,398 --> 00:30:23,839
does now Switching gears to um the

709
00:30:20,519 --> 00:30:26,480
Amazon so this is the Amazon but right

710
00:30:23,839 --> 00:30:29,119
close to the Andes so the andian uh the

711
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:31,519
Amazonian andian Foothill

712
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:32,518
and we're particularly going now to the

713
00:30:31,519 --> 00:30:35,079
VZ

714
00:30:32,519 --> 00:30:38,079
Arc and to the southern expression of

715
00:30:35,079 --> 00:30:41,119
the VZ Arc which is this CH range that

716
00:30:38,079 --> 00:30:43,439
I'm showing here so it's not 5,000

717
00:30:41,119 --> 00:30:46,398
meters elevation which we we had for the

718
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:48,519
Andes it's a smaller mountain range but

719
00:30:46,398 --> 00:30:52,599
it's enough to have rivers flow north

720
00:30:48,519 --> 00:30:55,519
and south of it so it does um affect

721
00:30:52,599 --> 00:30:59,918
drainage Evolution and sediment trans

722
00:30:55,519 --> 00:30:59,919
the transport of sediment Etc

723
00:31:00,558 --> 00:31:05,079
so we have we're in this corner again of

724
00:31:02,919 --> 00:31:07,038
Northwestern South America and these are

725
00:31:05,079 --> 00:31:09,839
the Andes and you have this

726
00:31:07,038 --> 00:31:11,919
perpendicular um series of mountains

727
00:31:09,839 --> 00:31:13,599
that are called the VZ Arc and this is

728
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:15,880
the southern expression of that Arc

729
00:31:13,599 --> 00:31:19,798
which is called the chid range is what

730
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:22,600
you see here this whole range uplifted

731
00:31:19,798 --> 00:31:25,918
at 8 million years ago and some of these

732
00:31:22,599 --> 00:31:28,319
rocks that are exposed are older but um

733
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:31,278
The Ark is thought to be 8 million years

734
00:31:28,319 --> 00:31:34,158
old and this creates the water divide

735
00:31:31,278 --> 00:31:36,398
between Orin noia and Amazonia which are

736
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:39,960
two very important biogeographical

737
00:31:36,398 --> 00:31:43,278
regions for South America so Orin noia

738
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:45,960
is seasonally dry savanas while Amazonia

739
00:31:43,278 --> 00:31:48,599
is closed canopy rainforest so they're

740
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:51,960
extremely different just because of this

741
00:31:48,599 --> 00:31:55,759
low relief created by this Arc and a

742
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:59,200
parenthesis here is that this Chik range

743
00:31:55,759 --> 00:32:01,679
hosts one of the most um extraordinary

744
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:03,960
archaeological sites kilometers and

745
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:06,840
kilometers of rock paintings that have

746
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:09,159
been dated at 20,000 years ago to

747
00:32:06,839 --> 00:32:11,720
present and in these Rock paintings you

748
00:32:09,159 --> 00:32:14,159
can even find animals that are now

749
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:16,919
extinct like the giant sloth um so

750
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:19,919
they're really old rock paintings this

751
00:32:16,919 --> 00:32:19,919
is one of our sampling

752
00:32:20,119 --> 00:32:25,158
sites and for Amazonia there have been

753
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:27,200
different factors that have been studied

754
00:32:25,159 --> 00:32:28,360
that influence its uh the distribution

755
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:30,880
of its bio

756
00:32:28,359 --> 00:32:32,719
so current climatic variables uh

757
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:35,278
vegetation structure which doesn't lead

758
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:38,000
to much turnover and one of them is

759
00:32:35,278 --> 00:32:40,919
River and barriers so the effect that

760
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:43,200
River Basin uh Evolution has on

761
00:32:40,919 --> 00:32:45,278
structuring um

762
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:47,480
composition and we wanted to explore

763
00:32:45,278 --> 00:32:49,000
that in particular study that in

764
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:51,360
particular

765
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:54,240
because what was found with these maps

766
00:32:51,359 --> 00:32:56,000
for anbian is that these are this this

767
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:58,638
this is the water divide so what you

768
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:01,159
have here in dark green and in yellow

769
00:32:58,638 --> 00:33:03,199
that's the water divide between orino

770
00:33:01,159 --> 00:33:05,919
and Amazonia and you can see the

771
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:08,000
compositions are very distant they're

772
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:09,759
adjacent regions but with very different

773
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,480
compositions for

774
00:33:09,759 --> 00:33:16,359
amphibians so we used this group as

775
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:18,960
tarium there spiny balms um some of them

776
00:33:16,359 --> 00:33:22,398
are very abundant um very important in

777
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:24,960
Amazonia too for local economies this is

778
00:33:22,398 --> 00:33:27,158
again the water divide um what you have

779
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:31,159
here is again that water divide along

780
00:33:27,159 --> 00:33:33,679
the V AR so we've been sampling asarum

781
00:33:31,159 --> 00:33:38,600
ganum which is an understory Palm that

782
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:41,120
you see here chamba a ter canopy palm

783
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:44,678
and jawari which is a raran lives along

784
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:47,599
rivers palm of the same genus and we've

785
00:33:44,679 --> 00:33:50,320
been sampling along the rivers of this

786
00:33:47,599 --> 00:33:52,678
whole region of the water divide we've

787
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:56,879
done Seven Rivers so

788
00:33:52,679 --> 00:33:58,519
far covering the the water divide and I

789
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:01,960
just wanted to take a minute to show you

790
00:33:58,519 --> 00:34:03,759
asarum Jai it always lives along rivers

791
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:05,360
you can't really sample it by walking

792
00:34:03,759 --> 00:34:07,879
you have to sample it from the boat

793
00:34:05,359 --> 00:34:10,398
because there's nowhere to stand on and

794
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:14,679
this is how complex vegetation is there

795
00:34:10,398 --> 00:34:18,319
at that site this is this is asarum Ja

796
00:34:14,679 --> 00:34:21,480
showing a little bit of its

797
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:24,720
crown and what we found is even if this

798
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:26,918
relief system isn't as high as the Andes

799
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:30,398
it does structure populations north and

800
00:34:26,918 --> 00:34:32,480
south of the relief system so in all of

801
00:34:30,398 --> 00:34:34,239
the three species even if they have

802
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:36,838
different habitats if they have

803
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:39,358
different life histories they do the the

804
00:34:36,838 --> 00:34:41,918
individuals do group north and south of

805
00:34:39,358 --> 00:34:44,000
the Divide so this is that uh relief

806
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:45,398
system where it would be and then you

807
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,559
have the southern populations and

808
00:34:45,398 --> 00:34:50,039
Northern populations north of and south

809
00:34:47,559 --> 00:34:52,799
of the Divide south of the Divide North

810
00:34:50,039 --> 00:34:55,559
of the divide in the river species it's

811
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:58,119
more complicated you have uh like a

812
00:34:55,559 --> 00:35:00,400
softer break between North and South and

813
00:34:58,119 --> 00:35:02,880
we think this is because of its habit so

814
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:05,240
we do have like two groups but the cut

815
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:08,559
is softer and we think it has to do with

816
00:35:05,239 --> 00:35:10,838
the fact that fruits land on water and

817
00:35:08,559 --> 00:35:12,960
then they remain viable for many months

818
00:35:10,838 --> 00:35:16,719
and they can float on rivers and then

819
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:19,519
dispersal is um more efficient in this

820
00:35:16,719 --> 00:35:21,358
species fsts are low between North and

821
00:35:19,519 --> 00:35:24,239
South for all of the three species this

822
00:35:21,358 --> 00:35:26,920
is work I'm doing with um funding from

823
00:35:24,239 --> 00:35:30,000
papes Brazil and Minas Colombia with

824
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:32,559
South American collaborators in campas

825
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:36,079
and in the UN naal

826
00:35:32,559 --> 00:35:39,078
colia so structure is

827
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:43,039
um Divergence is not is not big between

828
00:35:39,079 --> 00:35:45,960
north and south and in the P species you

829
00:35:43,039 --> 00:35:48,480
do have more outliers for

830
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:50,318
FST and they consistently group so the

831
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:52,760
southern groups consistently group these

832
00:35:50,318 --> 00:35:55,400
are Snapper calibrated trees using using

833
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:58,520
Snips and using the coalescent and

834
00:35:55,400 --> 00:36:01,039
generation times to estimate ages um and

835
00:35:58,519 --> 00:36:02,920
what we find is that Divergence between

836
00:36:01,039 --> 00:36:05,519
North and South so here between north

837
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:08,519
and south north and south is a couple

838
00:36:05,519 --> 00:36:10,838
hundred uh thousand years at most so it

839
00:36:08,519 --> 00:36:13,400
really doesn't seem to have anything to

840
00:36:10,838 --> 00:36:16,519
do with the formation of this Arc but

841
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:20,838
more so with how Rivers have evolved

842
00:36:16,519 --> 00:36:24,000
later after the ark formed so more with

843
00:36:20,838 --> 00:36:28,799
River incision Dynamics starting at

844
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:31,760
130,000 years and not with uplift per se

845
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:35,119
and there's this wonderful paper if

846
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:37,520
you're interested in how rivers form um

847
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:39,400
especially about this area from Brea and

848
00:36:37,519 --> 00:36:43,679
collaborators explaining the process of

849
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:45,119
how rivers form after they um yeah how

850
00:36:43,679 --> 00:36:47,039
how they how they have formed in this

851
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:50,000
area now we're running demographic

852
00:36:47,039 --> 00:36:51,239
models to understand how much gene flow

853
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:54,920
there has been if it has been a

854
00:36:51,239 --> 00:36:58,039
different time Windows Etc so I had

855
00:36:54,920 --> 00:37:00,760
worked with um Cino communities in the

856
00:36:58,039 --> 00:37:04,719
Andes but sampling in all of these

857
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:09,520
rivers of Amazonia led me to uh work

858
00:37:04,719 --> 00:37:14,358
with Amazonian people and become really

859
00:37:09,519 --> 00:37:14,358
um in awe of how much they know about

860
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:19,319
biodiversity and we we wanted to show

861
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:21,280
that we wanted to show how important

862
00:37:19,318 --> 00:37:23,719
they are how much they know and how much

863
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:27,000
they protect

864
00:37:23,719 --> 00:37:30,719
so so so we moved I had some experience

865
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:33,239
with Cino andian um communities but this

866
00:37:30,719 --> 00:37:37,039
is a whole different story um cultural

867
00:37:33,239 --> 00:37:39,199
diversity in Amazonia is a lot bigger um

868
00:37:37,039 --> 00:37:41,440
linguistic diversity as well and it's

869
00:37:39,199 --> 00:37:44,358
kind of a more remote area in in

870
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:47,119
Northwestern Amazonia at least it's it's

871
00:37:44,358 --> 00:37:49,799
a lot more remote hard to work in so we

872
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:52,640
started by just working with um urance

873
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:55,599
data so we produce these um distribution

874
00:37:52,639 --> 00:37:57,480
models for all uh 260 Colombian Palms so

875
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:59,480
Colombia has 10% of the species that

876
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:02,760
diversity for the world in terms of

877
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:04,280
palms and 260 species and we stacked

878
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:06,880
those distribution models and we wanted

879
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:10,319
to see if there are richness centers and

880
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:13,240
so in pink you see the most species rich

881
00:38:10,318 --> 00:38:16,599
places and here in red these are the

882
00:38:13,239 --> 00:38:19,000
polygons for uh collectively owned lands

883
00:38:16,599 --> 00:38:21,000
indigenous collectively owned lands so

884
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:23,039
there's always been this debate at least

885
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:25,280
in Colombia and several um South

886
00:38:23,039 --> 00:38:27,119
American countries if collectively owned

887
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,960
lands are good for uh conservation or

888
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:30,200
not

889
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:31,880
if um collectively owned lands are

890
00:38:30,199 --> 00:38:35,279
protected or not or if they fall under

891
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:38,318
the tragedy of the commons and we wanted

892
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:40,000
to show that there's High diversity in

893
00:38:38,318 --> 00:38:42,880
areas where there's collectively owned

894
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:45,199
territories but there Al there's also uh

895
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:47,039
they they're also away from threat so

896
00:38:45,199 --> 00:38:49,759
where we find most threatened species

897
00:38:47,039 --> 00:38:51,519
this is the map of uh threatened species

898
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:53,680
is really away from these collectively

899
00:38:51,519 --> 00:38:55,000
owned territories so this just

900
00:38:53,679 --> 00:38:57,639
highlights the importance for

901
00:38:55,000 --> 00:39:00,480
conservation of collectively owned lands

902
00:38:57,639 --> 00:39:02,759
and um cultural knowledge related to

903
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:02,760
these

904
00:39:03,679 --> 00:39:09,399
territories so we teamed up with leaders

905
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:11,599
from different communities from the Bora

906
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:14,480
mu muan

907
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:16,760
tiuna communities to work on asarum

908
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:18,639
because we had been uh sampling it

909
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:22,560
because we had we were more familiar

910
00:39:18,639 --> 00:39:25,598
with that um system and with graduate

911
00:39:22,559 --> 00:39:28,880
students Lena from Colombia and Carmen

912
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:28,880
from ASU

913
00:39:29,199 --> 00:39:32,960
and we came up with this research

914
00:39:30,639 --> 00:39:35,199
question so this is allm Mar's home

915
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:37,199
these are allm Mar's relatives and this

916
00:39:35,199 --> 00:39:41,480
is asaran

917
00:39:37,199 --> 00:39:44,239
Palms our communities um only access uh

918
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:46,240
accessing so just like harvesting uh

919
00:39:44,239 --> 00:39:48,598
palms or are they contributing to

920
00:39:46,239 --> 00:39:50,479
safeguarding and modifying biodiversity

921
00:39:48,599 --> 00:39:53,318
at least in terms of these Palms that

922
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:55,559
are recognized and used by them is the

923
00:39:53,318 --> 00:39:58,440
genomic architecture and selection of

924
00:39:55,559 --> 00:40:01,279
managed versus wild species different

925
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:02,440
and we're starting now with asarum

926
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:04,480
because there are so many different

927
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:06,159
species that are used and managed but we

928
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:09,760
have to start somewhere so we're using

929
00:40:06,159 --> 00:40:12,000
asarum because it's a system we know

930
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:13,960
more about and is their historical

931
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:17,920
demography different reflecting cultural

932
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:19,639
uses so can we understand U by studying

933
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:21,159
their historical demography can we

934
00:40:19,639 --> 00:40:23,000
understand something about use the

935
00:40:21,159 --> 00:40:27,159
history of use of these

936
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:30,039
species and this ties to two important

937
00:40:27,159 --> 00:40:32,239
um models in anthropology and

938
00:40:30,039 --> 00:40:34,679
archaeology which is a to like a

939
00:40:32,239 --> 00:40:37,039
paradigm shift in South America and in

940
00:40:34,679 --> 00:40:39,279
particular in these um communities from

941
00:40:37,039 --> 00:40:40,800
Northwestern South America which is a

942
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:43,800
well-known shift between Hunter

943
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:45,680
Gathering and agriculture because uses

944
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:48,000
of plants are so different and the way

945
00:40:45,679 --> 00:40:49,960
you use landscape and you use land is so

946
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,960
different in the two different paradigms

947
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:54,760
so hunter gatherers are generalist they

948
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:57,599
use many many species they only collect

949
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:59,720
parts of native plants they highly

950
00:40:57,599 --> 00:41:03,559
mobile they move around a

951
00:40:59,719 --> 00:41:05,639
lot um they don't affect plant densities

952
00:41:03,559 --> 00:41:08,078
as much they exert low selective

953
00:41:05,639 --> 00:41:11,480
pressures and they work with mostly wild

954
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:14,400
genomes whereas in agricultural

955
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:17,679
societies people are more specialized

956
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:20,480
they um replace the standing vegetation

957
00:41:17,679 --> 00:41:23,279
they're more sedentary so Less Mobile

958
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:25,639
plant plant densities are determined

959
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:28,880
chosen there's High selective pressure

960
00:41:25,639 --> 00:41:33,559
of the used species and genomes are more

961
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:36,838
managed but the Amazonian system is

962
00:41:33,559 --> 00:41:39,799
somewhere in between because many wild

963
00:41:36,838 --> 00:41:42,599
species are grown but not

964
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:46,880
within traditional agriculture right

965
00:41:42,599 --> 00:41:48,200
it's it's they're um grown or enriched

966
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:51,720
in nearby

967
00:41:48,199 --> 00:41:54,078
forests and they use some uh species

968
00:41:51,719 --> 00:41:56,679
that don't are not native from that site

969
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:59,480
but many of the Native species so it's

970
00:41:56,679 --> 00:42:02,199
what has been termed the hunter gather

971
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:04,358
horticulturalists they create these um

972
00:42:02,199 --> 00:42:05,879
Gardens that they tend but they also

973
00:42:04,358 --> 00:42:08,519
grow things within the forest so it's

974
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:10,318
like managed forests it's a different

975
00:42:08,519 --> 00:42:12,239
system and it's connected to What's

976
00:42:10,318 --> 00:42:14,358
called the chagra systems so they are

977
00:42:12,239 --> 00:42:17,399
still generalists they use many many

978
00:42:14,358 --> 00:42:19,799
many species including many

979
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:21,760
Palms they grow and collect parts of

980
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:25,119
native plants but they don't entirely

981
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:27,599
replace what's standing so they keep

982
00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:29,318
some of the Native species

983
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:30,960
they increase the density of some of

984
00:42:29,318 --> 00:42:33,079
them so they will increase the densities

985
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:35,599
of their used species they're highly

986
00:42:33,079 --> 00:42:38,720
mobile so these homes are moved around

987
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:41,800
and they are highly mobile but we don't

988
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:43,759
know about their selection pressures how

989
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:46,400
managed the genomes are and if they are

990
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:48,599
structural um effects on the genomes of

991
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:50,680
these species or not if we can find some

992
00:42:48,599 --> 00:42:52,960
sign of not domestication but of

993
00:42:50,679 --> 00:42:57,639
management at

994
00:42:52,960 --> 00:43:00,400
least and if they behave as wild species

995
00:42:57,639 --> 00:43:02,558
or and why are they seem to be adapted

996
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:06,160
to these anthropogenic

997
00:43:02,559 --> 00:43:09,040
systems so asarum chamba is one of these

998
00:43:06,159 --> 00:43:12,639
species that you can rarely find in Deep

999
00:43:09,039 --> 00:43:15,639
Forest so it's native but if you get

1000
00:43:12,639 --> 00:43:19,719
away from humans you no longer find it

1001
00:43:15,639 --> 00:43:22,199
it's managed used for fibers uh so it's

1002
00:43:19,719 --> 00:43:24,519
a source of fibers and it's yeah it's

1003
00:43:22,199 --> 00:43:27,519
rarely found within deep

1004
00:43:24,519 --> 00:43:29,599
forests mostly around humans and it's

1005
00:43:27,519 --> 00:43:31,679
used this way so it's used Within These

1006
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:33,359
managed forests it's harvested the young

1007
00:43:31,679 --> 00:43:36,759
leaves from Young individuals are

1008
00:43:33,358 --> 00:43:39,239
harvested the fibers are extracted

1009
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:42,800
washed and dried then dyed and then

1010
00:43:39,239 --> 00:43:45,199
woven into bags

1011
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:48,440
hammocks and its sister species so this

1012
00:43:45,199 --> 00:43:53,000
is chamba the managed species for fibers

1013
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:54,880
and its sister species is sympatric not

1014
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:57,480
managed not

1015
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:59,519
used so we saw an excellent opport Unity

1016
00:43:57,480 --> 00:44:01,440
to compare if there's something

1017
00:43:59,519 --> 00:44:03,880
different about their genomes because

1018
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:06,240
their sister they Sy Patrick but one is

1019
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:09,519
managed and the other one is not however

1020
00:44:06,239 --> 00:44:11,558
we haven't been able to uh flash freeze

1021
00:44:09,519 --> 00:44:14,239
and you know this is an essential part

1022
00:44:11,559 --> 00:44:16,280
of getting um good genome assemblies

1023
00:44:14,239 --> 00:44:19,039
because you need long reads and it has

1024
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:20,359
been difficult to flash freeze and

1025
00:44:19,039 --> 00:44:23,318
Export because you need all these

1026
00:44:20,358 --> 00:44:25,199
permits and it's a long process so can

1027
00:44:23,318 --> 00:44:26,880
we do it without Flash freezing yes we

1028
00:44:25,199 --> 00:44:28,358
can but we need a lot of help so we've

1029
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:30,240
been working with these different

1030
00:44:28,358 --> 00:44:32,000
institutes and what we're basically

1031
00:44:30,239 --> 00:44:34,759
doing is we're extracting High molecular

1032
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:37,400
weight DNA um from tissues fixed in

1033
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:40,359
ethanol then we're doing chromatin the

1034
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:43,160
high SE sequencing from tissues uh fixed

1035
00:44:40,358 --> 00:44:45,639
in PG Shield which is this uh solution

1036
00:44:43,159 --> 00:44:47,960
only under testing and then we're doing

1037
00:44:45,639 --> 00:44:50,118
RNA sequencing from tissues fixed in RNA

1038
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:51,880
later so when we go to the field and we

1039
00:44:50,119 --> 00:44:55,440
collect we collect in these all of these

1040
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:57,960
Solutions Plus the herbarium

1041
00:44:55,440 --> 00:45:00,519
sample and from silic at dry tissues we

1042
00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:03,519
also try to get packed by a long reads

1043
00:45:00,519 --> 00:45:05,759
and we do get something from them um

1044
00:45:03,519 --> 00:45:09,920
however what we got is like one8 of the

1045
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:12,200
expected yield um and when we

1046
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:14,358
assembled it was like 2third of the

1047
00:45:12,199 --> 00:45:16,719
genome so these these genomes are rather

1048
00:45:14,358 --> 00:45:19,239
large three to four Giga base pairs and

1049
00:45:16,719 --> 00:45:21,639
we got two to twoth thirds of the of the

1050
00:45:19,239 --> 00:45:23,358
whole length of the genome so it's

1051
00:45:21,639 --> 00:45:25,799
satisfying you get something but you

1052
00:45:23,358 --> 00:45:28,199
won't get chromosome level fully

1053
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:30,200
resolved um whole genomes if you're

1054
00:45:28,199 --> 00:45:31,719
working with silica dried tissue and you

1055
00:45:30,199 --> 00:45:34,078
won't be able to annotate them because

1056
00:45:31,719 --> 00:45:35,679
you don't we won't have the RNA so this

1057
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:38,680
is where we're at with this project we

1058
00:45:35,679 --> 00:45:40,960
don't still have um results but I still

1059
00:45:38,679 --> 00:45:43,879
wanted to show you because um this is

1060
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:43,880
where we where we're

1061
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:50,480
going late run late a little

1062
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:52,719
okay so yeah in the future I still want

1063
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:54,519
to continue working with Palms around

1064
00:45:52,719 --> 00:45:57,439
humans I think they can tell us so much

1065
00:45:54,519 --> 00:45:59,838
about um

1066
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:02,079
anthropogenic systems but also about

1067
00:45:59,838 --> 00:46:04,358
what humans create so humans create

1068
00:46:02,079 --> 00:46:06,880
drier systems or systems that tend to

1069
00:46:04,358 --> 00:46:09,078
dry more more open environments in

1070
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:11,599
particular this species does very well

1071
00:46:09,079 --> 00:46:13,519
in transitional systems and I think they

1072
00:46:11,599 --> 00:46:15,480
can tell us a lot about the evolution of

1073
00:46:13,519 --> 00:46:17,280
people U and of more Disturbed

1074
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:18,880
environment so we're teaming up with

1075
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:21,319
Montgomery Botanical center and

1076
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:24,640
colleagues from ASU

1077
00:46:21,318 --> 00:46:27,199
um to work on the historical demography

1078
00:46:24,639 --> 00:46:29,519
we are also trying to find but we

1079
00:46:27,199 --> 00:46:31,399
haven't been successful so far but we're

1080
00:46:29,519 --> 00:46:33,920
uh um extracting more and more

1081
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:36,039
environmental um Edna from

1082
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:38,039
archaeological soils to see if we find

1083
00:46:36,039 --> 00:46:41,800
this bom on archaeological

1084
00:46:38,039 --> 00:46:45,159
soils and um to continue with my future

1085
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:47,359
goals I've been very collections based I

1086
00:46:45,159 --> 00:46:49,920
see the enormous potential of of

1087
00:46:47,358 --> 00:46:51,799
collections in Colombia I formed this

1088
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:54,159
tissue collection which is now covers

1089
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:57,519
all of the Colombian palms and has now

1090
00:46:54,159 --> 00:47:00,239
5,300 specimens and with this tissue

1091
00:46:57,519 --> 00:47:03,239
collection I could um along with

1092
00:47:00,239 --> 00:47:05,558
herbarium work in herbaria I could um

1093
00:47:03,239 --> 00:47:08,639
write monographs describe species work

1094
00:47:05,559 --> 00:47:11,119
on red listing so I think they're very

1095
00:47:08,639 --> 00:47:13,000
valuable assets because they help

1096
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:15,079
prepare Society children students and

1097
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:17,440
researchers to become interested in the

1098
00:47:15,079 --> 00:47:20,119
future of biodiversity they really time

1099
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:22,880
and space observatories facing um

1100
00:47:20,119 --> 00:47:25,079
biodiversity crisis they can guide our

1101
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:27,599
exploration strategies so where when how

1102
00:47:25,079 --> 00:47:30,680
to collect right um

1103
00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:32,920
and their cultural repositories too um

1104
00:47:30,679 --> 00:47:35,039
about plant and human species and

1105
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:37,119
species interactions so I see the

1106
00:47:35,039 --> 00:47:40,199
enormous potential of

1107
00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:42,039
Collections and well you have a great

1108
00:47:40,199 --> 00:47:45,239
collection here Palm collection the

1109
00:47:42,039 --> 00:47:47,039
continent's largest Palm herbarium I

1110
00:47:45,239 --> 00:47:50,558
I've told uh several people that I've

1111
00:47:47,039 --> 00:47:54,000
met that I started my journey with Palms

1112
00:47:50,559 --> 00:47:56,880
by um working on some ma some material

1113
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:59,358
that had been sent by Dr natal U to the

1114
00:47:56,880 --> 00:48:02,358
person who was my supervisor uh during

1115
00:47:59,358 --> 00:48:05,000
my PhD so Cornell has always been a

1116
00:48:02,358 --> 00:48:06,838
reference collection and and it is a

1117
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:08,800
reference collection for all Palm

1118
00:48:06,838 --> 00:48:11,440
researchers in the

1119
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:13,559
world so with that I want to leave time

1120
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:14,599
for questions and thank you uh all for

1121
00:48:13,559 --> 00:48:18,800
your

1122
00:48:14,599 --> 00:48:22,000
attention um thank you very

1123
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:25,400
much have time for a couple

1124
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:27,480
questions yes first of all thanks for

1125
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:30,200
giving us so much to think about

1126
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:31,760
Marvel's presentation um I'm G of course

1127
00:48:30,199 --> 00:48:34,879
I'm going to ask you about The Beetles

1128
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:36,200
yes yeah and so not only the the

1129
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:38,800
beautiful Montaine system that you

1130
00:48:36,199 --> 00:48:41,039
showed us but also the peach Palms it

1131
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:43,440
makes me think a lot of figs because

1132
00:48:41,039 --> 00:48:45,558
those those trees are feeding so much

1133
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:47,480
biomass right they're they're connecting

1134
00:48:45,559 --> 00:48:50,440
the forest through frugivores Etc

1135
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:53,440
they're really important um and all the

1136
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:55,400
focus on pollinator Health in this

1137
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:58,240
continent and in Europe is very B

1138
00:48:55,400 --> 00:49:00,838
Centric thinking about bee management

1139
00:48:58,239 --> 00:49:02,519
bee viruses all of that these beetles

1140
00:49:00,838 --> 00:49:05,000
that pollinate your palms are never

1141
00:49:02,519 --> 00:49:06,559
regarded as important you know in terms

1142
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:09,318
of their ecosystem services so my

1143
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:11,400
question for you is uh unlike figs you

1144
00:49:09,318 --> 00:49:13,079
know they don't live their entire lives

1145
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:14,160
inside the palm tree where do these

1146
00:49:13,079 --> 00:49:16,079
beetles live when they're not

1147
00:49:14,159 --> 00:49:18,239
pollinating your palms and is that part

1148
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:20,440
of the conservation question as well to

1149
00:49:18,239 --> 00:49:22,358
preserve their habitat yes so this is

1150
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:24,440
why we really liked our results because

1151
00:49:22,358 --> 00:49:26,960
it shows the importance of congenerics

1152
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:29,559
because we found in several Genera astar

1153
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:32,880
included which I didn't show results of

1154
00:49:29,559 --> 00:49:34,880
but for astrarium when you have um

1155
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:36,680
different species of that genus living

1156
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:38,318
together they keep the pollinator alive

1157
00:49:36,679 --> 00:49:40,558
they share the main pollinator and they

1158
00:49:38,318 --> 00:49:42,880
keep it alive so you do need assemblages

1159
00:49:40,559 --> 00:49:45,200
to keep your main pollinator alive it's

1160
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:46,798
not like you can go and plant a species

1161
00:49:45,199 --> 00:49:49,199
away from its ecosystem and keep the

1162
00:49:46,798 --> 00:49:51,280
pollinator alive because it takes a a

1163
00:49:49,199 --> 00:49:53,439
village to raise a child because it

1164
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:55,599
takes the con generics that share that

1165
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:57,880
same that that U main pollinator so

1166
00:49:55,599 --> 00:50:00,000
that's the case for Asar for ter for

1167
00:49:57,880 --> 00:50:03,559
cerox and we're finding more and more

1168
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:06,480
that's a pattern for bacteries it's a

1169
00:50:03,559 --> 00:50:09,240
different group it's barine another um

1170
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:11,679
uh tribe that's the so another tribe but

1171
00:50:09,239 --> 00:50:15,078
it's still beetles and that's right for

1172
00:50:11,679 --> 00:50:17,798
for Palms it's mostly beetles and it's

1173
00:50:15,079 --> 00:50:21,680
mostly unknown beetles uh undescribed

1174
00:50:17,798 --> 00:50:24,079
beetles and miniature beetles um so they

1175
00:50:21,679 --> 00:50:25,639
have just been disregarded and I think

1176
00:50:24,079 --> 00:50:28,599
they're an asset of of of course of

1177
00:50:25,639 --> 00:50:30,598
forest that we should look more into um

1178
00:50:28,599 --> 00:50:33,039
so I think the way they keep them alive

1179
00:50:30,599 --> 00:50:36,200
is there's special

1180
00:50:33,039 --> 00:50:38,358
specialization but there's not it it's

1181
00:50:36,199 --> 00:50:40,639
not these these pollinators are not

1182
00:50:38,358 --> 00:50:43,078
exclusive to one species so that they

1183
00:50:40,639 --> 00:50:44,400
can um share it around across the year

1184
00:50:43,079 --> 00:50:47,559
so there has to be some standing

1185
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:49,160
diversity to keep them alive um that's

1186
00:50:47,559 --> 00:50:52,240
another reason why monocultures don't

1187
00:50:49,159 --> 00:50:55,639
work yes thank you and it's another

1188
00:50:52,239 --> 00:50:57,598
reason why um these communities that

1189
00:50:55,639 --> 00:50:59,838
have lived for thousands of years in the

1190
00:50:57,599 --> 00:51:03,318
Amazon know that the best way to get

1191
00:50:59,838 --> 00:51:05,440
food is by growing or enriching their

1192
00:51:03,318 --> 00:51:07,358
palms of interest within biodiverse

1193
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:09,480
systems because they'll get a higher

1194
00:51:07,358 --> 00:51:13,039
yield and not

1195
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:15,480
by just extracting the one species and

1196
00:51:13,039 --> 00:51:18,440
multiplying it by the hundreds and

1197
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:21,079
thousands but by keeping it in a managed

1198
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:23,960
by biodiverse

1199
00:51:21,079 --> 00:51:26,280
System here in the Northeast yes when

1200
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:28,760
the settlers came it's estimated roughly

1201
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:32,640
90 % of our land is cleared for for

1202
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:35,440
Farming purposes surprisingly now sorry

1203
00:51:32,639 --> 00:51:37,879
uh it it it seems to have recovered um

1204
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:40,039
for the most part in terms of diversity

1205
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:41,720
and currently when we see some of these

1206
00:51:40,039 --> 00:51:44,480
successional lands they're they're a

1207
00:51:41,719 --> 00:51:45,919
monoculture of golden rod and and but

1208
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:48,039
apparently that plays an important role

1209
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:50,838
in that succession can you speak to

1210
00:51:48,039 --> 00:51:53,599
Palm's role in natural succession back

1211
00:51:50,838 --> 00:51:55,480
to Forest from disturbed land yeah so

1212
00:51:53,599 --> 00:51:57,599
what you normally see for these canopy

1213
00:51:55,480 --> 00:52:00,119
bombs it's different from the understory

1214
00:51:57,599 --> 00:52:02,400
herbs but what you can see with the T

1215
00:52:00,119 --> 00:52:04,960
canopy Palms is when you have a high

1216
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:06,838
abundance of canopy Palms that usually

1217
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:08,798
coincides with an early successional

1218
00:52:06,838 --> 00:52:11,078
stage why because they're monocots they

1219
00:52:08,798 --> 00:52:13,920
can grow faster than other trees right

1220
00:52:11,079 --> 00:52:16,039
so they form these um early Forest um

1221
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:18,400
and then as the forest becomes more and

1222
00:52:16,039 --> 00:52:20,318
more mature and the canopy becomes more

1223
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:22,559
closed and there's more Shadow then

1224
00:52:20,318 --> 00:52:25,519
ponds become less abundant so you will

1225
00:52:22,559 --> 00:52:28,599
still have the same uh Regional pool of

1226
00:52:25,519 --> 00:52:31,079
species ALB in lower abundances relative

1227
00:52:28,599 --> 00:52:33,480
abundances for each so FMS do play an

1228
00:52:31,079 --> 00:52:35,400
important role in producing biomass in

1229
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:38,559
those first um early stages of

1230
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:40,559
succession and then um as the forest

1231
00:52:38,559 --> 00:52:42,119
becomes more mature they become less and

1232
00:52:40,559 --> 00:52:43,079
less abundant but still remain in the

1233
00:52:42,119 --> 00:52:45,599
regional

1234
00:52:43,079 --> 00:52:47,519
pool the

1235
00:52:45,599 --> 00:52:51,039
golden

1236
00:52:47,519 --> 00:52:55,719
yes and they're very um opportunistic

1237
00:52:51,039 --> 00:52:57,358
because they love light so an open

1238
00:52:55,719 --> 00:52:59,519
Corner in the Forest is always an

1239
00:52:57,358 --> 00:53:03,078
opportunity to grow faster and reproduce

1240
00:52:59,519 --> 00:53:05,880
faster so they use

1241
00:53:03,079 --> 00:53:09,119
it

1242
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:12,079
aleandra mention the volcanism during

1243
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:15,519
the my but you also have the inion of

1244
00:53:12,079 --> 00:53:18,720
the p c yes so do you think it have a

1245
00:53:15,519 --> 00:53:20,280
role in the diversification or the

1246
00:53:18,719 --> 00:53:23,679
increase

1247
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:26,280
in highly diverse populations that you

1248
00:53:23,679 --> 00:53:28,879
have there yeah so the the Pea system

1249
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:30,720
has been more studied in terms of

1250
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:33,358
Divergence because it meant a barrier

1251
00:53:30,719 --> 00:53:35,558
for low elevation plants whereas this

1252
00:53:33,358 --> 00:53:38,759
volcanism was like

1253
00:53:35,559 --> 00:53:41,079
um we're we're studying it as a point of

1254
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:42,920
connection between Mountain segments so

1255
00:53:41,079 --> 00:53:44,960
they're within the same region but the

1256
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:46,318
PBA system is a little bit Northeast of

1257
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:49,079
where we're at with these volcanic

1258
00:53:46,318 --> 00:53:51,639
centers and these volcanic centers are

1259
00:53:49,079 --> 00:53:54,519
on top of existing low topography so

1260
00:53:51,639 --> 00:53:56,920
they're acting upon mid elevation lands

1261
00:53:54,519 --> 00:53:58,759
so already within um the the area of

1262
00:53:56,920 --> 00:54:02,039
influence of the Andes whereas the PBA

1263
00:53:58,760 --> 00:54:03,520
system was um east of the Andes and so

1264
00:54:02,039 --> 00:54:05,838
they're they're similar in the way that

1265
00:54:03,519 --> 00:54:07,960
both can both certainly affect the

1266
00:54:05,838 --> 00:54:09,400
distribution of diversity they're both

1267
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:11,318
certainly interesting because we can

1268
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:14,240
date them from different perspectives

1269
00:54:11,318 --> 00:54:17,159
and see how this system comes together

1270
00:54:14,239 --> 00:54:19,000
um and I know the PBA system is

1271
00:54:17,159 --> 00:54:22,920
specifically interesting because it left

1272
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:27,079
behind all of these um species adapted

1273
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:30,318
to marshes and um seasonally flooded um

1274
00:54:27,079 --> 00:54:32,519
areas so like maiia and manicaria and

1275
00:54:30,318 --> 00:54:34,400
all of these species that were left

1276
00:54:32,519 --> 00:54:36,519
behind by the PBA system so the PBA

1277
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:38,798
system was a marine incursion and it

1278
00:54:36,519 --> 00:54:42,199
left behind all these swamps and then

1279
00:54:38,798 --> 00:54:45,079
the Marine incursion retracted um and

1280
00:54:42,199 --> 00:54:49,039
and further north but it left all of

1281
00:54:45,079 --> 00:54:51,359
these swamp uh adapted species so it's

1282
00:54:49,039 --> 00:54:52,960
funny because you're walking on T in the

1283
00:54:51,358 --> 00:54:54,719
Amazon and you're finding all these

1284
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:57,880
species that look like they're

1285
00:54:54,719 --> 00:55:00,719
Coastal but it's because of it's another

1286
00:54:57,880 --> 00:55:02,119
example of how uh there are signs of the

1287
00:55:00,719 --> 00:55:03,358
past everywhere if you know how to look

1288
00:55:02,119 --> 00:55:06,358
for

1289
00:55:03,358 --> 00:55:08,119
them so that I think we're gonna have to

1290
00:55:06,358 --> 00:55:09,798
uh end the questions if you have any

1291
00:55:08,119 --> 00:55:11,920
other things questions You' like to ask

1292
00:55:09,798 --> 00:55:14,159
come on up and don't forget there's a

1293
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:18,240
lunch with The Graduate students

1294
00:55:14,159 --> 00:55:18,239
immediately now thank you

1295
00:55:20,920 --> 00:55:26,480
