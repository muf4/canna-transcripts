1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:05,360
this is a production of cornell

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:05,360
university

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,639
so thank you all for coming and thanks

4
00:00:11,039 --> 00:00:14,160
bill for the introduction

5
00:00:12,638 --> 00:00:16,480
so i'm going to talk about population

6
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,560
genetics of my phytoplasms

7
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:20,719
phytophthora infestas is the causal

8
00:00:18,559 --> 00:00:22,960
organism of green light disease that is

9
00:00:20,719 --> 00:00:24,160
a disease that affects mainly potatoes

10
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:27,599
and tomatoes

11
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:29,759
it can grow on leaves stems tubers in

12
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:32,159
the case of potatoes and fruits in the

13
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:34,320
case of tomatoes

14
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:36,398
phytophthora infestance reproduces both

15
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,960
sexually and asexually

16
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:39,679
the sexual cycle serves like any other

17
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,640
organism

18
00:00:39,679 --> 00:00:43,359
as a mode of survival and recombination

19
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,200
and

20
00:00:43,359 --> 00:00:46,878
phytophthora intestines to be able to

21
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,520
reproduce sexually it meets two

22
00:00:46,878 --> 00:00:50,799
different

23
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:53,920
organisms and these are called terms

24
00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:55,839
a1 and a2 matin types and with when the

25
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:59,280
a1 and the a2 mating types

26
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:02,399
meet and then they recombine their

27
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:04,239
dna material they form an all spore

28
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:06,239
which is the sexual score

29
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:08,478
and this is a spore that serves as a

30
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:11,280
mechanism for survival because

31
00:01:08,478 --> 00:01:13,118
it can resist a high temperatures very

32
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,599
low temperatures and it can survive in

33
00:01:13,118 --> 00:01:18,239
the soil for many years

34
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:20,640
the asexual cycle on the other hand

35
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:23,759
accounts for population increase

36
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:26,799
and the asexual spore are the sporangia

37
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:30,239
this sporangia can germinate directly

38
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:32,799
or indirectly by releasing soil spores

39
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:35,199
and it can release up to 12 solar spores

40
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:36,720
and each of this source force is able to

41
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,200
cause an infection

42
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:41,920
so whenever the pathogen is able to

43
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:44,320
germinate indirectly epidemics are much

44
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,920
faster because instead of having one

45
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:49,279
infection set you can have

46
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:50,879
up to 12 infectious sites in the united

47
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,159
states phytoplankton intestines

48
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:55,599
reproduces mainly

49
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:57,439
asexually and that's why we have a

50
00:01:55,599 --> 00:02:00,319
population that is very simple

51
00:01:57,438 --> 00:02:01,758
composed only of a few clonal lineages

52
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:04,959
and clonal lineages

53
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:07,438
are all asexuals descendants

54
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:10,399
from a single individual and variation

55
00:02:07,438 --> 00:02:12,318
within them arises by mutations

56
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:13,520
so how are these clonal lineages

57
00:02:12,318 --> 00:02:15,679
determined

58
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,640
they are determined utilizing a set of

59
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,840
markers

60
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:21,759
so we have utilized an allosite test

61
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,039
we determine the mating type of the

62
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:25,120
individual

63
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:26,639
we do a restriction fragment left

64
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:29,280
polymorphism assay

65
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:30,878
using the a moderately repetitive dna

66
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,959
probe rj57

67
00:02:30,878 --> 00:02:34,479
which can show differences between

68
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:36,400
individuals

69
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:38,719
most recently we're using 12

70
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:41,599
microsatellite markers

71
00:02:38,719 --> 00:02:44,080
we have mitochondrial haplotyping and

72
00:02:41,598 --> 00:02:47,199
nuclear gene sequences

73
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:50,000
in the united states over the past

74
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:50,799
40 years there have been approximately

75
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,800
24

76
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:57,519
different clonal lineages of phytoplasms

77
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,719
but in any particular year we only see a

78
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:01,840
few of this

79
00:02:58,719 --> 00:03:03,919
for example since the late 1990s

80
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:06,000
u.s eighth quarter lineage is the one

81
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:07,839
that has been prevalent

82
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,519
and this lineage is a really good

83
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,840
pathogen of potatoes

84
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:13,680
it doesn't grow very well in tomatoes

85
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:16,158
and it's resistant to a very

86
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,439
useful or effective fungicide called

87
00:03:16,158 --> 00:03:19,120
methanoxins

88
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:20,878
and because it is resistant to

89
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:24,959
methanoxan people stopped

90
00:03:20,878 --> 00:03:28,479
using this fungicide in the late 1990s

91
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:31,039
so in 2009 the us was again

92
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:32,000
reminded of how devastating late flight

93
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:34,318
this

94
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,158
and this is the year that as bill said i

95
00:03:34,318 --> 00:03:37,119
came here to do an internship so i

96
00:03:36,158 --> 00:03:40,399
experienced

97
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:42,080
this epidemic and why was it so bad it

98
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:45,760
was bad because

99
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:48,400
tomato plants little siblings were being

100
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:50,719
shipped to all retail stores so lowe's

101
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,719
walmart was selling tomato plants that

102
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:54,878
were infected with the pathogen

103
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:56,799
and home gardeners and organic growers

104
00:03:54,878 --> 00:03:58,318
were growing disinfected plants in their

105
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:00,239
homes or in their fields

106
00:03:58,318 --> 00:04:01,759
and they helped disperse this disease

107
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:04,799
throughout the u.s

108
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:06,798
so in june 24 we

109
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:07,840
found our a professor in the department

110
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:10,959
he barely brought

111
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:12,719
a infected tomato plant to our lab from

112
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:15,360
one of these retail stores

113
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:17,040
and then by the end by mid august it was

114
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:20,079
all over new york state

115
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,879
so since i was here during this summer i

116
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:23,680
experienced

117
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:25,199
bill's face of panic and like doing an

118
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:28,079
emergency meeting

119
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:30,240
and he invited a doctor keith perry and

120
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:32,639
dr tom cedar to join this meeting

121
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,000
as well as the lab and i saw how worried

122
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,840
they were they were saying like

123
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,680
okay what's going on like all tomatoes

124
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:39,679
are dying what's different

125
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,040
what's happening and immediately i saw

126
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,519
like this was important

127
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:45,120
i just had like done things in the lab

128
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:47,599
but i forgot about

129
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:49,280
the impact the real input so people were

130
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,000
losing everything they were losing a lot

131
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:51,758
of money

132
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,160
so it was super important so that's why

133
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:56,560
i decided to come back in 2011

134
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,840
and figure out what what was this new

135
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:01,199
lynch

136
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:02,319
so as i had said before here i'm going

137
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:05,120
to show

138
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:06,000
the ice the genotypes that we have

139
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,959
received

140
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,199
in our lab from potato and tomatoes and

141
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:14,159
prior to 2009

142
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:15,360
us-8 which is this pink collar was the

143
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,639
dominant village

144
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,600
there were others but this was a

145
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:21,759
dominant one then in 2009

146
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,680
you can see that this red lineage which

147
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:27,199
we called us 22

148
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:28,959
started displacing us-8 and this us-22

149
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:30,800
was that same genotype that wasn't the

150
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:31,599
tomato seedlings that were being sold

151
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,240
everywhere

152
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:36,240
so it makes sense that humans help

153
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:39,680
disperse these diseases and that's why

154
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:41,038
we see this change but then in 2010 and

155
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:43,439
2011

156
00:05:41,038 --> 00:05:45,120
we see that other new genotypes arise

157
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:48,478
these are us-23

158
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:51,199
in dark blue and us-24 in light blue

159
00:05:48,478 --> 00:05:52,959
as well as this rare and diverse

160
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:53,759
genotypes which you can see in the

161
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:56,959
striped

162
00:05:53,759 --> 00:06:00,240
bars which we had no idea what they were

163
00:05:56,959 --> 00:06:01,918
so we i arrived in 2011 and i wanted to

164
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,478
figure out like okay

165
00:06:01,918 --> 00:06:05,599
what is going on with this what what's

166
00:06:04,478 --> 00:06:07,199
happening with phytoplankton

167
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,680
infestations in the u.s

168
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:11,360
so just to put you into context today

169
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:14,079
the situation is this

170
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:16,240
us-23 is displacing all of the other

171
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:17,120
genotypes and today us-23 is the

172
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:20,400
prevalent

173
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:22,399
genes so again we have 24 different

174
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:25,038
lineages but on a particular year

175
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:27,839
there's one that predominance

176
00:06:25,038 --> 00:06:28,680
so my first research objective was to

177
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:31,279
investigate

178
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:33,439
epidemiologically important phenotypic

179
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:34,719
characteristics of the recently emerged

180
00:06:33,439 --> 00:06:38,319
colonial lineages

181
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:41,280
this were us 22 23 and 24

182
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:43,120
and more specifically i wanted to know

183
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:44,959
what was the host preference of this

184
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,959
genotype

185
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:48,478
if temperature had an effect in the

186
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:51,680
germination

187
00:06:48,478 --> 00:06:55,199
if germination rates differ among

188
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:57,038
lineages and if this isolate differ

189
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:58,960
in their sensitivity to the fungicide

190
00:06:57,038 --> 00:07:01,279
methanox

191
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:02,719
so the first phenotype i studied was

192
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:05,359
host preference

193
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,800
and to do this i inoculated tomato and

194
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:09,360
potato leaflets

195
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,879
and i placed them at 15 degrees celsius

196
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,720
and after six days

197
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:14,240
i washed this leaflets with three

198
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:17,199
milliliters of water

199
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:19,360
and i counted angel so in this figure

200
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:21,840
what we're seeing here in the y-axis

201
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:24,000
are square energy counts and in the

202
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:25,758
x-axis we're seeing the

203
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,079
three the four different vintages i

204
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:30,000
studied i included usa

205
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:32,079
as a control because we already knew

206
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,839
what we were going to expect we knew usa

207
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:36,159
preferred to grow on potatoes

208
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:38,318
and indeed we can see that the gray bars

209
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:40,400
are potatoes the blacks are tomatoes

210
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:42,080
so we can see that usage correlates much

211
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:43,198
better on potatoes than it does on

212
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:47,198
tomatoes

213
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:49,598
but we learned that us 22 and us 22 at 3

214
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:51,280
were very good pathogens of tomatoes

215
00:07:49,598 --> 00:07:54,079
and what's even more interesting is that

216
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:57,918
they were also able to grow a potato

217
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:58,399
and the us 24 was very similar to usaid

218
00:07:57,918 --> 00:08:01,198
in that

219
00:07:58,399 --> 00:08:03,198
it was able to grow better on potatoes

220
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:04,800
and not that greater tomatoes

221
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:06,800
the numbers that i have within

222
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:10,400
parenthesis represent the number of

223
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:13,520
isolates i used for genotype

224
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:15,279
so all of this i did it in the lab but

225
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:17,038
something that was really cool was to

226
00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:18,719
see that when you separate

227
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:21,439
that figure i showed at the beginning

228
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:23,440
but here i've only included isos that

229
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:27,038
came to the lab from potato

230
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:28,478
we can see that we see us-8 and us-24

231
00:08:27,038 --> 00:08:30,240
like dominating and these were the

232
00:08:28,478 --> 00:08:33,598
lineages that refer to growth

233
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:36,240
on potato and then we can see that us-23

234
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:36,959
is very good pathogen of potato as well

235
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,959
and today

236
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:40,879
like most of the samples we receive are

237
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:42,958
from us 23

238
00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:47,519
and you see how usaid that was very

239
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:51,039
important prior to 2009 is disappearing

240
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:53,839
on tomato we see that us 22 was

241
00:08:51,039 --> 00:08:54,799
exclusively found in 2009 on tomatoes so

242
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:56,240
us-8

243
00:08:54,799 --> 00:08:59,278
you can see us we haven't gotten a

244
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:00,159
sample of us-8 since 2009 growing on

245
00:08:59,278 --> 00:09:03,838
tomatoes

246
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:05,199
there were a few isolates from us 24 and

247
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:06,959
tomato but very real

248
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:09,278
in comparison to those that came from

249
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:11,759
the table

250
00:09:09,278 --> 00:09:12,799
the next phenotype i wanted to study was

251
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:15,679
the effect of

252
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:16,879
germinated temperature and germination

253
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:18,239
so as i had mentioned in the

254
00:09:16,879 --> 00:09:21,120
introduction

255
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:22,240
um german direct germination is when the

256
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,320
sporangia

257
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:26,720
forms a germ tube and it infects it

258
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:28,560
penetrates the leaf and causes infection

259
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:31,040
whereas in direct germination the

260
00:09:28,559 --> 00:09:33,119
sporangium releases eight sauceports and

261
00:09:31,039 --> 00:09:35,278
each of this is able to germinate

262
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:37,200
so the epidemics are much more

263
00:09:35,278 --> 00:09:38,320
aggressive if indirect termination is

264
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,879
happening

265
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,839
so how i did this experiment is i

266
00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:45,278
inoculated

267
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:45,920
a microscopic slide slides with water

268
00:09:45,278 --> 00:09:49,039
agar

269
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:51,120
droplets i put the inoculum of the sperm

270
00:09:49,039 --> 00:09:53,120
oh i put sporangia in them

271
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,159
and then i placed those parents at four

272
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:57,600
different temperatures

273
00:09:54,159 --> 00:10:00,319
10 15 20 and 25 degrees celsius

274
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,920
and after 16 hours i counted on the

275
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:05,120
microscope how many

276
00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:07,439
esperanza were empty indicating that

277
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:10,399
those had germinated indirectly or how

278
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:12,720
many sporangia had germinated directly

279
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:14,559
so here in the continuous lines we see

280
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:16,560
that in direct germination

281
00:10:14,559 --> 00:10:18,559
and what we can see is that at lower

282
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:20,159
temperatures in direct germination is

283
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:23,919
favored and as temperature

284
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:26,480
decreases sorry as temperature increases

285
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:28,639
in direct termination decreases

286
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,680
something that's also interesting is if

287
00:10:28,639 --> 00:10:34,799
you see

288
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:36,399
at 15 degrees celsius us-8 and us-22

289
00:10:34,799 --> 00:10:38,479
do not do that well i mean they don't

290
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:41,839
release as many solar spores

291
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:44,159
but us-23 and us-24 do

292
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:45,440
release more soil spores at 50. so

293
00:10:44,159 --> 00:10:48,399
temperature

294
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:49,600
varies a little bit between between

295
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:51,839
genotypes

296
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:53,440
and in terms of direct germination we

297
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:55,920
learn it's not that common

298
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:58,160
but when it happens it happens more at

299
00:10:55,919 --> 00:11:01,679
higher temperature

300
00:10:58,159 --> 00:11:04,000
so we were interested in seeing how fast

301
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:06,159
our sporadic release in soil spores and

302
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,919
if some genus types release soil spores

303
00:11:06,159 --> 00:11:10,159
more quicker than others

304
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:11,838
so i did a similar experiment but

305
00:11:10,159 --> 00:11:13,120
instead of placing

306
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:14,720
the isolate at four different

307
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,759
temperatures i only placed it at a

308
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:18,800
single temperature

309
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:20,559
it was 40 degrees celsius and i had and

310
00:11:18,799 --> 00:11:21,519
what i did is counted how many sperm

311
00:11:20,559 --> 00:11:25,919
that were emptied

312
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:29,759
after 30 minutes 90 minutes 150 210

313
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:30,958
and 960 minutes and what we were amazed

314
00:11:29,759 --> 00:11:34,559
because we didn't know that

315
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:37,599
before is that us 24 released

316
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:39,119
a soul sports by 30 minutes 80 percent

317
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,720
of their spranda were empty

318
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,879
so it's really quick at releasing

319
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,759
saucers whereas the other ones are

320
00:11:42,879 --> 00:11:46,159
slower

321
00:11:43,759 --> 00:11:48,319
so we still do not know what are the

322
00:11:46,159 --> 00:11:50,399
implications of this but if you can

323
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:52,560
imagine a summer that has very short

324
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:55,600
periods of cold temperature

325
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:58,638
genotypes isolates belonging to

326
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,759
a genotype us24 are going to be favored

327
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:01,519
because they are going to be able to

328
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:02,799
release a lot of solar sports and are

329
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:04,320
going to be able to cause a lot of

330
00:12:02,799 --> 00:12:06,639
infection

331
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:09,920
and finally the last phenotype i

332
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:11,278
assessed was sensitivity to methanoxy

333
00:12:09,919 --> 00:12:14,479
and methyl oxen

334
00:12:11,278 --> 00:12:15,278
is a phenylal fungicide that is widely

335
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,120
used against

336
00:12:15,278 --> 00:12:20,159
almond seeds and it's believed to

337
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:22,480
inhibit the ribosomal rna biosynthesis

338
00:12:20,159 --> 00:12:24,480
this is the same fungicide that we knew

339
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:26,480
usaid was resistant to so that's why

340
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:29,519
people stopped using it

341
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:32,320
to assess sensitivity to methanoxin

342
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:34,720
what we did was uh take isolates that

343
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:37,360
had never been exposed to methanoxan

344
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:40,160
and we then transfer them to plates with

345
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:42,079
no methanoxin which were our controls

346
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:44,240
other plates with low concentrations of

347
00:12:42,078 --> 00:12:47,120
methanoxin and other plates with high

348
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:50,959
pressure high concentration of methanols

349
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:53,200
so for isolates that were resistant

350
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:54,159
basically how we assessed it is that

351
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,879
when

352
00:12:54,159 --> 00:12:59,039
in the in our controls there were plates

353
00:12:56,879 --> 00:13:02,159
that had no methanoxin when growth was

354
00:12:59,039 --> 00:13:05,199
80 to 90 percent of the plate then we

355
00:13:02,159 --> 00:13:06,879
measured the diameter of the three

356
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:09,920
different concentrations

357
00:13:06,879 --> 00:13:12,720
and we reported growth here

358
00:13:09,919 --> 00:13:14,879
relative to growth here so how much less

359
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:16,079
it grew here than here or how much more

360
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:18,240
grew here than here

361
00:13:16,078 --> 00:13:19,278
so us8 is resistant and you can see that

362
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,039
it grows very well

363
00:13:19,278 --> 00:13:22,399
at low concentrations and at high

364
00:13:21,039 --> 00:13:25,599
concentrations

365
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:27,440
but us-22 is sensitive it doesn't grow

366
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:29,278
it grows very little at low

367
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:31,440
concentrations and almost nothing

368
00:13:29,278 --> 00:13:33,360
at high concentrations and this is

369
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:36,000
something people did not know you in

370
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:38,079
2009 and that's why the epidemic was so

371
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,679
bad if people would have known that the

372
00:13:38,078 --> 00:13:41,439
u.s turned into a sensitive they could

373
00:13:39,679 --> 00:13:44,799
have again used the sponsorship and

374
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:45,360
saved a lot of money so we investigated

375
00:13:44,799 --> 00:13:48,559
this

376
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:51,120
in u.s 23 and u.s 24 as well

377
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:51,759
and what i have in this figure is in the

378
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:54,480
bottom we

379
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:56,078
we have the concentrations of methanoxin

380
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:59,519
the white bars represent

381
00:13:56,078 --> 00:14:02,958
growth at zero my with no methanoxan

382
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:03,839
so because this bars are relative to

383
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:05,198
those ones

384
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:07,040
the white ones you're always going to

385
00:14:05,198 --> 00:14:09,278
see us as a hundred percent

386
00:14:07,039 --> 00:14:10,480
and then you're going to see that us8 is

387
00:14:09,278 --> 00:14:14,320
resistant whereas

388
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:14,320
these three lineages are sensitive

389
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:18,240
something that was very interesting is

390
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:20,639
we wanted to see whether

391
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,759
resistance or sensitivity was maintained

392
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:24,799
over the years

393
00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:26,559
so here we have genotypes that we

394
00:14:24,799 --> 00:14:29,120
collected in 2009

395
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:31,759
genotypes we collected in 2010 and

396
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:34,320
genotypes we collected in 2011

397
00:14:31,759 --> 00:14:36,720
and we did again the same type of study

398
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:39,519
we inoculated each of those

399
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,920
at five and a hundred and we can see

400
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:43,440
that

401
00:14:39,919 --> 00:14:46,078
for us eight for example

402
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,639
the resistance was maintained over the

403
00:14:46,078 --> 00:14:50,078
years

404
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:53,360
and for us 22 23 and 24

405
00:14:50,078 --> 00:14:56,479
isolates that were found in 2009 were

406
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:56,879
sensitive in 2010 as well and in 2011 as

407
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,120
well

408
00:14:56,879 --> 00:15:00,958
and like that we decide for us 23 and

409
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:03,519
news 24.

410
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:04,638
so to conclude this first part of my

411
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:08,399
work

412
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:10,000
what we learned was that us-22 and us-23

413
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:11,519
were very good packaging of both

414
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,720
potatoes and tomatoes

415
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:16,480
whereas us-8 and us-24 were good

416
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:19,759
pathogens of material

417
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:22,240
we learned that all of the new lineages

418
00:15:19,759 --> 00:15:23,600
22 23 and 24 were sensitive to

419
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:26,720
methanoxin

420
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:29,278
we also learned that 24 germinates

421
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:30,879
much quicker than the others indirectly

422
00:15:29,278 --> 00:15:35,120
at lower temperatures

423
00:15:30,879 --> 00:15:37,278
and this data was used by farmers to to

424
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:38,560
to apply informed management decisions

425
00:15:37,278 --> 00:15:42,320
so for example

426
00:15:38,559 --> 00:15:44,319
in 2012 this blue that

427
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:46,000
kind of gray blue that we see here is

428
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:47,920
lineage us11

429
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,919
so this is a lineage that we hadn't seen

430
00:15:47,919 --> 00:15:53,120
since early 2000s but

431
00:15:49,919 --> 00:15:54,559
it appeared again in 2012 and that

432
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:56,799
lineage grows

433
00:15:54,559 --> 00:15:58,159
on tomato and potato and it's resistant

434
00:15:56,799 --> 00:16:00,319
to methanol

435
00:15:58,159 --> 00:16:02,799
so when when the farmers send their

436
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:04,879
samples to our lab we genotype them

437
00:16:02,799 --> 00:16:06,639
and then they receive you have us 11 or

438
00:16:04,879 --> 00:16:08,720
you have us 23.

439
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:11,039
so they call tour lab and they say okay

440
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:13,040
i received that i have us 23

441
00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:14,799
should i spray or should i not and we

442
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:17,278
could tell them yes great because

443
00:16:14,799 --> 00:16:18,958
it's sensitive but others that called

444
00:16:17,278 --> 00:16:20,159
and said i have you as 11 can you pray

445
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:21,679
with me

446
00:16:20,159 --> 00:16:23,838
we told him no don't spray because it's

447
00:16:21,679 --> 00:16:25,838
resistant so people are really

448
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:27,120
thankful for this data because it helps

449
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:30,560
them make decisions that

450
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:32,320
save them a lot of money so

451
00:16:30,559 --> 00:16:34,078
now going to my second research

452
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:36,160
objective

453
00:16:34,078 --> 00:16:38,319
here i'm showing again the result for

454
00:16:36,159 --> 00:16:41,679
methanoxin sensitivity

455
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:44,079
and and we see that us22 is sensitive

456
00:16:41,679 --> 00:16:45,120
it doesn't it grows very little at 500

457
00:16:44,078 --> 00:16:48,479
100

458
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:50,639
but there's some growth at 5.

459
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,759
so we were wondering okay what happens

460
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:54,159
if we take

461
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:55,360
a plug or a sample from the iso that

462
00:16:54,159 --> 00:16:57,600
growing at five

463
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:58,720
and we transfer it to zero five and a

464
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,720
hundred again

465
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:01,759
so we are expecting to see this right

466
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:05,279
but instead

467
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:08,400
this is what we saw after yeah

468
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:09,918
i was going to say the results but so we

469
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:12,000
looked into the literature

470
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:13,439
and and we saw that other people had

471
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,240
reported this that there

472
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:18,319
there was some resistance after exposure

473
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:19,199
to sublethal concentrations of the

474
00:17:18,318 --> 00:17:21,359
fungus

475
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:22,480
so we became very interested in this

476
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:24,879
phenomenon

477
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:27,038
and my second research objective was to

478
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:28,640
learn the characteristics of methanoxan

479
00:17:27,038 --> 00:17:30,720
acquire resistance

480
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:32,640
so more specifically i wanted to know if

481
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:35,600
this phenomenon was unique

482
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:36,880
to us 22 or if it was more universal for

483
00:17:35,599 --> 00:17:38,719
other strains

484
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:41,600
i wanted to know how fast did

485
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:43,839
methanoxaman fire resistance occur

486
00:17:41,599 --> 00:17:45,279
and i wanted to see the gene expression

487
00:17:43,839 --> 00:17:47,439
differences between

488
00:17:45,279 --> 00:17:50,798
initially sensitive isolates and those

489
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:54,480
same isolates after they had a viruses

490
00:17:50,798 --> 00:17:56,879
so again i'm showing usaid

491
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:59,599
in this figure what we can see is here

492
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:01,440
it's the previous exposure so it means

493
00:17:59,599 --> 00:18:03,759
all isolates that are here have never

494
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:06,320
been exposed to methanoxan before

495
00:18:03,759 --> 00:18:07,599
and they were then transferred to 0 5

496
00:18:06,319 --> 00:18:10,480
and 100

497
00:18:07,599 --> 00:18:12,319
whereas isolates that are here have been

498
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:15,279
previously exposed to 5

499
00:18:12,319 --> 00:18:16,240
and then i transfer them to 0 5 on 100

500
00:18:15,279 --> 00:18:19,599
and we can see

501
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:21,759
that for usa8 it is resistant and after

502
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:22,959
being exposed to methanoxan it continues

503
00:18:21,759 --> 00:18:26,720
to be resistance

504
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:28,480
but for us 22 we see that at the

505
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:29,919
beginning acids that have never been

506
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:33,038
exposed to methanoxan

507
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:34,720
are sensitive to methanoxan but just

508
00:18:33,038 --> 00:18:36,480
after a single transfer through

509
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:39,120
methanoxal containing media they

510
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:41,038
increase the resistance immediately

511
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:43,199
and so we wanted to know whether this

512
00:18:41,038 --> 00:18:44,000
was unique for us 22 or for other

513
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,960
isolates

514
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,558
and we saw it for us 23 and u.s 24 the

515
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:50,400
same phenomenon occurred

516
00:18:48,558 --> 00:18:52,558
after a single transfer through

517
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:55,519
methanoxan containing media either

518
00:18:52,558 --> 00:18:56,319
low or high concentrations resistance

519
00:18:55,519 --> 00:18:59,759
increased

520
00:18:56,319 --> 00:19:02,558
for us 23 and u.s 24.

521
00:18:59,759 --> 00:19:04,400
so is the phenomenon of acquire systems

522
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:05,918
unique to certain strains of my doctor

523
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:07,280
intestines it's not

524
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:09,280
it can happen at least in three

525
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:10,480
different sensitive originally sensitive

526
00:19:09,279 --> 00:19:13,200
genotypes

527
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:14,960
how fast does it occur it occurs after a

528
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,798
single passage through metronox

529
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:18,960
containing media

530
00:19:16,798 --> 00:19:21,038
and now we're interested in seeing the

531
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:23,120
gene expression differences between the

532
00:19:21,038 --> 00:19:24,240
originally sensitive isolates and those

533
00:19:23,119 --> 00:19:27,359
same ones

534
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:28,400
with acquire systems so to answer this

535
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:30,719
question

536
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,679
we used one individual of usaid which is

537
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,839
resistant

538
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:36,880
one individual of us 23 and two

539
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:39,678
individuals of us 24 which are sensitive

540
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:40,799
and we grew the isolated in pea broth

541
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:44,000
and we extracted

542
00:19:40,798 --> 00:19:45,679
extracted dna rna from it p brock with

543
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,519
normal phenoxy

544
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:48,720
and then we took isolates that had

545
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:50,960
already been

546
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:52,880
transferred several times to 100

547
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:55,120
micrograms per milliliter of methanoxan

548
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:57,200
so they had already acquired resistance

549
00:19:55,119 --> 00:19:58,798
we grew them on pbroth with 100

550
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:01,200
micrograms per milliliter

551
00:19:58,798 --> 00:20:01,918
of methanoxan and then we extracted

552
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,000
their rna

553
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:07,038
and we sent everything to sequence and

554
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:09,960
we did three biological records

555
00:20:07,038 --> 00:20:12,319
so from our rna sequencing we received

556
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:14,480
177 million reads

557
00:20:12,319 --> 00:20:16,639
but then these were aligned to ribosomal

558
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:18,640
rna and transfer rna to eliminate

559
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:22,080
the contamination from this and we ended

560
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:24,080
up with 5.5 to 9.5 million reads

561
00:20:22,079 --> 00:20:26,079
then we aligned it to the draft genome

562
00:20:24,079 --> 00:20:29,759
of phytoplastis

563
00:20:26,079 --> 00:20:33,119
and we were left with 4.6 to 7.8 million

564
00:20:29,759 --> 00:20:34,558
rock pounds then we normalized to

565
00:20:33,119 --> 00:20:36,798
account for the

566
00:20:34,558 --> 00:20:38,319
size of the genes because bigger genes

567
00:20:36,798 --> 00:20:39,200
are going to have more reads and smaller

568
00:20:38,319 --> 00:20:42,000
genes

569
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:44,480
and after that we studied the

570
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:47,679
differential gene expression

571
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:49,919
so we were interested in knowing these

572
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:51,120
were the the sensitive isolates so we

573
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:53,520
were different we were

574
00:20:51,119 --> 00:20:55,359
interested in knowing the differences in

575
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:57,359
gene expression between originally

576
00:20:55,359 --> 00:20:59,279
sensitive acids and those same ones

577
00:20:57,359 --> 00:21:01,678
after a fire system

578
00:20:59,279 --> 00:21:03,599
so we compared that and we found 32

579
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:06,798
genes that were significantly

580
00:21:03,599 --> 00:21:09,759
differentially expressed in response in

581
00:21:06,798 --> 00:21:12,558
all originally sensitive isolate studies

582
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:14,400
so some of these genes were upregulated

583
00:21:12,558 --> 00:21:15,279
among this there were 280p binding

584
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,519
cassettes

585
00:21:15,279 --> 00:21:19,759
one phospholipase 11 conserved

586
00:21:17,519 --> 00:21:21,839
hypothetical proteins some are excel are

587
00:21:19,759 --> 00:21:24,558
effectors sprinklers

588
00:21:21,839 --> 00:21:26,319
and endonuclear in the nucleus and

589
00:21:24,558 --> 00:21:30,079
manitoba's hydrogenates

590
00:21:26,319 --> 00:21:33,119
and some of the hypothetical functions

591
00:21:30,079 --> 00:21:34,720
you know the atp transport a cassette

592
00:21:33,119 --> 00:21:36,399
family or transporter so

593
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:38,159
it's logical to find transporters

594
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:40,400
because you can imagine that when you

595
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:41,360
expose an iso to stress it wants to get

596
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,679
rid of all these

597
00:21:41,359 --> 00:21:44,879
toxins that it's going inside of them

598
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:46,880
and this zombie

599
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:49,360
dependent receptor has also been implied

600
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:51,520
with some antibiotic resistance

601
00:21:49,359 --> 00:21:52,639
and then we saw some that were down

602
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:54,720
regulated

603
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:56,960
we still do not understand very well

604
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:57,759
like what these genes are how they are

605
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:00,480
implicated

606
00:21:57,759 --> 00:22:02,079
i mean much more research has to be done

607
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:04,640
to understand this

608
00:22:02,079 --> 00:22:06,480
but in conclusion all individuals from

609
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:09,679
all sensitive clinical lineage be

610
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:10,960
investigated became a tolerant of

611
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:13,038
methanoxin

612
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:14,079
and this tolerance occurred upon a

613
00:22:13,038 --> 00:22:17,038
single transfer

614
00:22:14,079 --> 00:22:18,158
through methanoxan containing media and

615
00:22:17,038 --> 00:22:19,519
among the 32

616
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:21,280
genes that were different and truly

617
00:22:19,519 --> 00:22:22,960
expressed there's some that could have

618
00:22:21,279 --> 00:22:26,079
putative functions

619
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:28,240
involving stress responses and further

620
00:22:26,079 --> 00:22:29,759
work will be necessary to identify the

621
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:32,798
precise mechanisms

622
00:22:29,759 --> 00:22:34,480
underlying this so we have not observed

623
00:22:32,798 --> 00:22:36,079
the fire assistance in the field which

624
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:37,919
is good news we saw that

625
00:22:36,079 --> 00:22:39,599
isos that are sensitive have been

626
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:41,919
sensitive throughout the years

627
00:22:39,599 --> 00:22:43,038
we inoculated some plants but there was

628
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:45,280
a lot of variants

629
00:22:43,038 --> 00:22:47,519
so we didn't really see anything in

630
00:22:45,279 --> 00:22:50,240
plants this is just an in vitro

631
00:22:47,519 --> 00:22:50,960
observation and we think it happens

632
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,798
because

633
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:55,200
perhaps there is a fitness cost

634
00:22:52,798 --> 00:22:57,359
associated with the acquire resistance

635
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:59,600
but we still need to investigate more to

636
00:22:57,359 --> 00:23:02,479
really understand this

637
00:22:59,599 --> 00:23:04,000
so now we understand a little bit more

638
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:06,000
about the prevalent

639
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,240
lineages of my copter intestines from

640
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:11,279
2009 to today

641
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:14,558
but now but what about this rare

642
00:23:11,279 --> 00:23:18,240
and diverse genotypes that happened that

643
00:23:14,558 --> 00:23:20,879
that we saw in 2010 and 2011.

644
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:21,359
so this rare and diverse genotypes were

645
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:24,720
found

646
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:26,879
mostly in new york state but some

647
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:28,880
individuals were found in pennsylvania

648
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:32,159
and in ontario canada

649
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:33,760
and if you see in this map with the red

650
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:36,000
lines i'm showing

651
00:23:33,759 --> 00:23:37,119
counties where only the a1 mating type

652
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,119
was found

653
00:23:37,119 --> 00:23:41,359
with the blue lines counties where only

654
00:23:39,119 --> 00:23:43,599
the eight remaining type was found

655
00:23:41,359 --> 00:23:44,719
and with the squares black squares

656
00:23:43,599 --> 00:23:47,359
counties where both

657
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:48,240
a1 and a2 made in touch were found so

658
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:50,399
remember that

659
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:53,038
when a1 and a two main types are

660
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:56,159
together sexual recombination can have

661
00:23:53,038 --> 00:23:57,839
and that is bad news so i want you to

662
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:59,278
look at this carefully because it

663
00:23:57,839 --> 00:23:59,759
doesn't mean the fact that we are not

664
00:23:59,278 --> 00:24:01,839
seeing an

665
00:23:59,759 --> 00:24:03,679
a2 here because it either wasn't one our

666
00:24:01,839 --> 00:24:05,199
sample size was really small

667
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:08,240
so it might have been by chance that we

668
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:11,360
didn't sample the a2

669
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:14,798
we named this genotypes gdt-1

670
00:24:11,359 --> 00:24:16,558
through gdt20 and the

671
00:24:14,798 --> 00:24:19,278
genotypes that i'm showing underlying

672
00:24:16,558 --> 00:24:22,480
were those that were found in 2010

673
00:24:19,278 --> 00:24:24,640
and the rest were all sampled in 2011 so

674
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:26,079
much more were sampled in 2011 and in

675
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:27,520
2010

676
00:24:26,079 --> 00:24:29,918
and something that i also want to

677
00:24:27,519 --> 00:24:31,119
highlight is that some genotypes the

678
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:34,240
ones that are involved

679
00:24:31,119 --> 00:24:37,278
were found in multiple counties

680
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:39,038
so my third research objective was to

681
00:24:37,278 --> 00:24:41,200
investigate the rare and diverse

682
00:24:39,038 --> 00:24:42,480
genotypes of phytoplasms that were

683
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:45,440
detected in a region

684
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:47,599
around central new york i wanted to know

685
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:50,640
if this new genotypes

686
00:24:47,599 --> 00:24:52,240
arose either by mutation migration or

687
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:55,278
recombination

688
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:58,880
and if they arose to recombination

689
00:24:55,278 --> 00:25:00,720
if there could be any of parents

690
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:02,880
among the dominant lineages that we were

691
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:06,319
seeing in the u.s

692
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:07,760
so again the three possible explanations

693
00:25:06,319 --> 00:25:09,839
for this scenario for

694
00:25:07,759 --> 00:25:11,679
seeing this diversity remember in 40

695
00:25:09,839 --> 00:25:14,240
years we have seen 24 different

696
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:15,360
genotypes in two years we saw twin so

697
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,038
that's weird

698
00:25:15,359 --> 00:25:18,879
so there could be three possible

699
00:25:17,038 --> 00:25:21,839
explanations either mutations

700
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:22,240
migrations or recombination we don't

701
00:25:21,839 --> 00:25:25,439
think

702
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:25,919
mutation is a possibility because the

703
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,840
this

704
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:30,320
these genotypes were diverse for their

705
00:25:27,839 --> 00:25:32,798
allosans their micro satellites

706
00:25:30,319 --> 00:25:34,319
their restriction fragments polymer

707
00:25:32,798 --> 00:25:36,158
fission their profiles

708
00:25:34,319 --> 00:25:37,519
they were polymorphic for their nuclear

709
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:40,480
genes and they showed

710
00:25:37,519 --> 00:25:42,558
diverse methanol sensitivity so they

711
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:45,679
were different in a lot of different

712
00:25:42,558 --> 00:25:48,158
low side and larger so it's really

713
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:50,559
not likely that this could be explained

714
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:53,200
by mutation in such a short time

715
00:25:50,558 --> 00:25:54,480
so mutation we don't think it is but it

716
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:57,600
could be migration

717
00:25:54,480 --> 00:26:00,319
or recombination and migration is a

718
00:25:57,599 --> 00:26:01,918
possibility for sure it could be that

719
00:26:00,319 --> 00:26:03,278
these genotypes arose

720
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:05,679
somewhere else and they were all

721
00:26:03,278 --> 00:26:06,319
transported either to tubers or tomato

722
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:08,880
seedlings

723
00:26:06,319 --> 00:26:10,720
to numeric states and that's when we

724
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:12,640
found them in new york state

725
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:14,319
but to test whether they came from

726
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:16,320
recombination we did

727
00:26:14,319 --> 00:26:17,599
a test that is called the index of

728
00:26:16,319 --> 00:26:20,000
association that is

729
00:26:17,599 --> 00:26:22,879
using the microsoft of hypnosis and this

730
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:25,119
test just proves the null hypothesis of

731
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:26,480
a recombination and we failed to reject

732
00:26:25,119 --> 00:26:28,879
it so

733
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:30,960
this genotype might represent a

734
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:34,320
recombinant population

735
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:34,960
our next question was if one of the

736
00:26:34,319 --> 00:26:36,720
dominant

737
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:38,159
clonal lineages could be one of the

738
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:40,319
possible parents

739
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:42,400
and in order to do this and this is how

740
00:26:40,319 --> 00:26:45,519
it's done also for humans to see if

741
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:47,038
a child is the child of some terms so we

742
00:26:45,519 --> 00:26:49,839
get a strength

743
00:26:47,038 --> 00:26:52,319
and then we get our perpetual progeny

744
00:26:49,839 --> 00:26:56,000
and what we do is we look at at

745
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:58,558
one locus at a time so if in that locus

746
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,278
they do not have any alleles in common

747
00:26:58,558 --> 00:27:02,639
then

748
00:26:59,278 --> 00:27:04,960
you that's not apparent of that project

749
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:06,159
but if it has one allele at least one

750
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:08,000
allele in common

751
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:10,159
then it might be apparent and then you

752
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,599
have to go to the next locus and do the

753
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:13,760
same thing

754
00:27:11,599 --> 00:27:16,000
so here i have a concrete example this

755
00:27:13,759 --> 00:27:19,599
is microsatellite dosa

756
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,319
i only have three loci here and what we

757
00:27:19,599 --> 00:27:23,199
can see

758
00:27:20,319 --> 00:27:26,079
is that for us8 the alleles which in

759
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:29,440
this case are numbers that are distances

760
00:27:26,079 --> 00:27:32,960
uh i mean sizes the for usa

761
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:34,880
it has for the d certain locus a 108 and

762
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:37,679
112 alleluia

763
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:38,480
but among all these new genotypes there

764
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:40,640
were not

765
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:43,200
none of the alleles were either of this

766
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:43,840
so we eliminated usaid as a possible

767
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:46,080
parent

768
00:27:43,839 --> 00:27:48,959
and doing the same type of reasoning we

769
00:27:46,079 --> 00:27:52,398
eliminated us 23 and u.s spring 4

770
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:54,159
as possible parents but us 22 was not

771
00:27:52,398 --> 00:27:57,199
eliminated

772
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:58,080
so further looking at other markers

773
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,360
because that was done with

774
00:27:58,079 --> 00:28:01,519
microsatellites

775
00:27:59,359 --> 00:28:04,079
us 22 share the same mitochondria

776
00:28:01,519 --> 00:28:06,319
hablotype as in your genotypes

777
00:28:04,079 --> 00:28:07,519
for the allosan glucose 6-phosphate

778
00:28:06,319 --> 00:28:11,839
isomerase

779
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:15,200
the us-22 had a 100 and a 1212 yield

780
00:28:11,839 --> 00:28:18,158
and the new types i had a 100 111 and 1

781
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:20,080
2012 u so this means that if us22 is

782
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:24,240
apparent the other parent had to

783
00:28:20,079 --> 00:28:26,480
contribute with the 111a

784
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:27,359
but when we look at the nuclear genes

785
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:30,159
what we found

786
00:28:27,359 --> 00:28:32,639
was that us22 could be apparent of some

787
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:36,640
but not of all of this new genotypes

788
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:39,679
and this is because us22 for three lossa

789
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:41,679
was homozygous for g t and g

790
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:43,679
whereas these three individuals were

791
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:45,919
homozygous for a different elite

792
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:46,960
so us 22 could not be the parent of this

793
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:49,520
real news but

794
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:51,278
it could be the parent of the other 17

795
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:53,599
individuals

796
00:28:51,278 --> 00:28:54,640
we next wanted to study population

797
00:28:53,599 --> 00:28:57,519
structure

798
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:59,278
and for this we included isolates that

799
00:28:57,519 --> 00:29:02,079
have been prevalent in the us

800
00:28:59,278 --> 00:29:03,599
at some point but we haven't seen over

801
00:29:02,079 --> 00:29:05,839
the past 10 years

802
00:29:03,599 --> 00:29:07,278
isolates that have been prevalent in the

803
00:29:05,839 --> 00:29:10,798
us over this past

804
00:29:07,278 --> 00:29:13,278
five years and the gdt isos and when we

805
00:29:10,798 --> 00:29:14,879
do this analysis the analysis tells us

806
00:29:13,278 --> 00:29:18,000
that we have two groups

807
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:20,640
we have one group in red that comprises

808
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,599
most all of the gdt isolates and one

809
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:24,240
group in green

810
00:29:21,599 --> 00:29:24,719
that comprises most of the us references

811
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:27,200
what is

812
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:28,798
interesting is that us-22 seems more

813
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:31,038
similar to the gdt

814
00:29:28,798 --> 00:29:32,398
than it does to any of the other us

815
00:29:31,038 --> 00:29:35,919
reference sizes

816
00:29:32,398 --> 00:29:38,558
but because this er software assumes

817
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:40,399
evolutionary models that are not valid

818
00:29:38,558 --> 00:29:43,119
for by doctrine infestance

819
00:29:40,398 --> 00:29:44,639
then we also run a discriminant analysis

820
00:29:43,119 --> 00:29:46,879
of principle component

821
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:48,080
which does not take into account any

822
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:50,880
molecular

823
00:29:48,079 --> 00:29:53,839
any evolutionary model and this was the

824
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:56,320
last one and this were done with

825
00:29:53,839 --> 00:29:57,119
and what we can see is that as as the

826
00:29:56,319 --> 00:30:00,879
other test

827
00:29:57,119 --> 00:30:02,959
we see that gdt group with us 22

828
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:05,360
then we see the u.s reference isolates

829
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:06,880
but this one further differentiates us

830
00:30:05,359 --> 00:30:10,000
from your us1

831
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:13,520
from the other axis so

832
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:14,798
in conclusion we found 20 rare and

833
00:30:13,519 --> 00:30:17,519
diverse

834
00:30:14,798 --> 00:30:19,599
genotypes composed of both a1 and a2

835
00:30:17,519 --> 00:30:20,158
mating types in northeastern usa and

836
00:30:19,599 --> 00:30:24,079
canada

837
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:26,320
in 2011. the gdt isolate seemed to be a

838
00:30:24,079 --> 00:30:28,798
recombinant population

839
00:30:26,319 --> 00:30:29,918
it seems that us-22 could be one of the

840
00:30:28,798 --> 00:30:31,918
possible patterns

841
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:33,120
for this new genotypes but at least

842
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:35,919
other two parents

843
00:30:33,119 --> 00:30:36,319
must exist we don't know who they are

844
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:38,799
and

845
00:30:36,319 --> 00:30:41,038
if the gdp assets represent a migrant

846
00:30:38,798 --> 00:30:42,798
population it's reasonable to think that

847
00:30:41,038 --> 00:30:44,480
they arose at a single place and then

848
00:30:42,798 --> 00:30:46,558
migrated to new york state

849
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:48,000
either through tubers or tomato

850
00:30:46,558 --> 00:30:51,839
seedlings or

851
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:53,839
humans we don't know so that was

852
00:30:51,839 --> 00:30:55,119
what we concluded for research objective

853
00:30:53,839 --> 00:30:57,759
3.

854
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:58,239
now i hope that at this point it's clear

855
00:30:57,759 --> 00:30:59,919
that

856
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:02,319
different genotypes of hydrogen

857
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:03,679
intestines even if they look similar

858
00:31:02,319 --> 00:31:05,759
they are very different in their

859
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:08,480
responses to a lot of

860
00:31:05,759 --> 00:31:08,960
different phenotypic traits so they

861
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:11,440
differ

862
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:12,159
very sensitivity to fungicides they have

863
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:14,798
different main

864
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:16,799
type mating types and they respond

865
00:31:14,798 --> 00:31:18,720
differently to different hosts

866
00:31:16,798 --> 00:31:20,639
and this is what farmers really want to

867
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:23,120
know i mean they i don't think they care

868
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:25,200
if they have us 11 22 or 23 they just

869
00:31:23,119 --> 00:31:26,959
want to know should i spray should i not

870
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:30,080
if i have tomatoes should i be worried

871
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:32,319
or not do i have two of this or just one

872
00:31:30,079 --> 00:31:34,558
that is what they want to know so what

873
00:31:32,319 --> 00:31:37,278
we're currently trying to address

874
00:31:34,558 --> 00:31:39,918
is if there are any genetic markers

875
00:31:37,278 --> 00:31:42,079
associated with phenotypic traits

876
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:43,440
that would allow us to determine the

877
00:31:42,079 --> 00:31:46,720
phenotype

878
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:48,798
within one day or hours instead of weeks

879
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:52,240
or months that is what it takes us to

880
00:31:48,798 --> 00:31:54,480
do all of these experiments so there is

881
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:56,000
one problem and the problem is that for

882
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:58,880
any two isolates

883
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,679
there are millions of differences so how

884
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:02,000
do we know

885
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:03,200
which of those differences are the ones

886
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,200
that will tell us

887
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:07,120
this is what is sensitive to my finances

888
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:09,600
this one is resistant

889
00:32:07,119 --> 00:32:12,719
so one of the ways to approach that is

890
00:32:09,599 --> 00:32:15,678
by doing a genome-wide association study

891
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:17,440
and to do that we have sequenced six u.s

892
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:21,120
reference genotypes

893
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:22,960
18 gdt isolates 36 mexican iceland and

894
00:32:21,119 --> 00:32:25,119
one european isolate

895
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:27,360
the mexican islands are very important

896
00:32:25,119 --> 00:32:28,000
because mexico is believed to be the

897
00:32:27,359 --> 00:32:31,199
center of

898
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:34,000
origin of phytoplankton intestines so

899
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:34,880
mexico mexican assets are very diverse

900
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:38,079
sexual

901
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:40,080
recombination occurs commonly like

902
00:32:38,079 --> 00:32:41,359
it from every everything you sample is

903
00:32:40,079 --> 00:32:42,319
probably an outcome of sexual

904
00:32:41,359 --> 00:32:44,558
recombination

905
00:32:42,319 --> 00:32:45,759
and in order to do a genome association

906
00:32:44,558 --> 00:32:47,918
study you need

907
00:32:45,759 --> 00:32:49,919
isolates that are diverse and are not

908
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:52,720
linked like the clones

909
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:54,000
and for all of these genotypes we are

910
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:56,720
phenotyping a

911
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,119
all of these traits so today i'm just

912
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:59,919
going to

913
00:32:57,119 --> 00:33:01,038
focus on the phenoxin sensitivity and

914
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:03,120
effect of

915
00:33:01,038 --> 00:33:05,278
temperature on dry weight because of

916
00:33:03,119 --> 00:33:07,439
time and i'll just show the results for

917
00:33:05,278 --> 00:33:10,798
the next communities

918
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:12,320
so again these are methanoxin

919
00:33:10,798 --> 00:33:14,798
sensitivity acids

920
00:33:12,319 --> 00:33:16,319
in the top we have growth at five

921
00:33:14,798 --> 00:33:18,319
micrograms per milliliter low

922
00:33:16,319 --> 00:33:20,480
concentrations of the fungicide

923
00:33:18,319 --> 00:33:22,398
and in the bottom we have growth at high

924
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:24,319
concentrations of the chronic

925
00:33:22,398 --> 00:33:26,319
and we can see that the mexican isolates

926
00:33:24,319 --> 00:33:29,439
are super diverse so

927
00:33:26,319 --> 00:33:31,200
if if you focus on this line this is

928
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:33,200
what the control group the control

929
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:34,798
through 100 because i'm showing this

930
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:37,038
relative to the controls

931
00:33:34,798 --> 00:33:38,079
so in the mexican isis there's some that

932
00:33:37,038 --> 00:33:39,599
grow better

933
00:33:38,079 --> 00:33:41,839
in the presence of methanoxan than

934
00:33:39,599 --> 00:33:44,000
without the penalty such as these ones

935
00:33:41,839 --> 00:33:44,879
and there's some that are very sensitive

936
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,960
that they don't grow

937
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:49,120
not even like at five micrograms per

938
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:50,640
milliliter so this diversity is really

939
00:33:49,119 --> 00:33:53,038
important and it's what we need to do

940
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:56,240
this type of studies

941
00:33:53,038 --> 00:33:57,038
um effect of temperature on my cellular

942
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:59,519
mass

943
00:33:57,038 --> 00:34:01,278
so here remember i was saying that for

944
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:03,278
germination low temperatures

945
00:34:01,278 --> 00:34:05,759
favor the indirect germination and that

946
00:34:03,278 --> 00:34:07,839
is good but for mycelial growth

947
00:34:05,759 --> 00:34:09,039
my cell growth is favored at higher

948
00:34:07,839 --> 00:34:12,000
temperatures

949
00:34:09,039 --> 00:34:12,559
so we are interested in this phenotype

950
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,719
because

951
00:34:12,559 --> 00:34:16,480
climate is changing and we know that the

952
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:18,959
summers are getting hotter

953
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:20,480
and we want to be able to predict which

954
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:22,559
isots are going to be

955
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:24,320
selected when temperatures are higher or

956
00:34:22,559 --> 00:34:26,799
when temperatures are low

957
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:27,760
so what we did is we transferred the

958
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:30,000
isolate

959
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:31,839
to four different plates and we placed

960
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:34,960
them at four different temperatures

961
00:34:31,838 --> 00:34:35,918
that were 10 15 20 and 25 degrees

962
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:37,679
celsius

963
00:34:35,918 --> 00:34:39,358
and after six days we measured the

964
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:42,559
diameter of growth

965
00:34:39,358 --> 00:34:43,199
and then what i'm presenting here is

966
00:34:42,559 --> 00:34:45,759
growth

967
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:48,559
relative to growth at 15 degrees celsius

968
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:49,200
so for example we can see that isolates

969
00:34:48,559 --> 00:34:51,199
grow

970
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:52,878
worse at 10 degrees celsius than they do

971
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:54,480
at 50 all of them

972
00:34:52,878 --> 00:34:56,000
so they really do not like cold

973
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:58,960
temperatures to grow

974
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,719
but 20 and 25 we start seeing some

975
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:04,000
diversity some isotopes grow

976
00:35:00,719 --> 00:35:06,559
really well at 25 better than 15

977
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,760
and others grow almost the same at 15

978
00:35:06,559 --> 00:35:09,440
that at 25

979
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:11,040
so this is something that we think is

980
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:14,480
very important but we

981
00:35:11,039 --> 00:35:17,440
have to investigate so these are the

982
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:19,760
phenotypic data but to sequence our isos

983
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:20,800
we are doing we did genotyping by

984
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:24,000
sequencing

985
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:26,560
what what this does is it takes the

986
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:29,599
whole dna of the isolate it cuts it with

987
00:35:26,559 --> 00:35:32,239
restriction enzymes that favor

988
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:34,559
gene dense regions so hopefully it will

989
00:35:32,239 --> 00:35:37,759
eliminate a lot of the repetitive dna

990
00:35:34,559 --> 00:35:41,039
and then we send them to sequence

991
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:42,320
so our results were we sent 65 isolates

992
00:35:41,039 --> 00:35:44,000
to sequence

993
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:46,000
most of these isotopes were sent in

994
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,838
triplicates or duplicates so that helped

995
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,199
us eliminate a lot of the missing data

996
00:35:47,838 --> 00:35:52,239
that we have

997
00:35:49,199 --> 00:35:55,358
we received 570 000

998
00:35:52,239 --> 00:35:56,078
snips after merging and merging i mean

999
00:35:55,358 --> 00:35:59,199
like

1000
00:35:56,079 --> 00:36:02,480
with the triplicates to have one single

1001
00:35:59,199 --> 00:36:03,759
genotype then we filter for proportion

1002
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:06,000
of missing data and

1003
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:06,880
minor allele frequency and we were left

1004
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:10,159
with 98

1005
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:11,760
000 snips so remember everything that i

1006
00:36:10,159 --> 00:36:15,679
have shown you before was with

1007
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:18,800
12 markers uh

1008
00:36:15,679 --> 00:36:22,000
24 36 markers now we have 98

1009
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:23,440
000 mark so this is important and what's

1010
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:26,239
even more

1011
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:28,559
cool i think is that after doing a

1012
00:36:26,239 --> 00:36:31,358
neighbor joining tree using those

1013
00:36:28,559 --> 00:36:33,119
uh snips we saw that a lot of the things

1014
00:36:31,358 --> 00:36:35,279
that have been proven in the past

1015
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:36,880
were real so that was what we were

1016
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:39,040
showing that expected to

1017
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:41,119
to be confident on our data so

1018
00:36:39,039 --> 00:36:43,920
everything that is black here

1019
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:46,000
are isolates that came from mexico and

1020
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:46,880
what is in blue are isolates that are in

1021
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:51,519
the u.s

1022
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:52,880
so us 23 is very similar to an iso that

1023
00:36:51,519 --> 00:36:55,280
came from europe

1024
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:57,358
and that was interesting because us 23

1025
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:59,200
has also been found in europe so there's

1026
00:36:57,358 --> 00:37:01,199
some connection either

1027
00:36:59,199 --> 00:37:02,239
europe sends it to us or we send it

1028
00:37:01,199 --> 00:37:03,519
there we don't know but

1029
00:37:02,239 --> 00:37:06,799
there's a connection between those

1030
00:37:03,519 --> 00:37:07,440
islands us-7 and us-11 are close

1031
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:10,800
together

1032
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:13,280
is also very nice because

1033
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:16,880
there are reports that us 11 is the

1034
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:19,280
progeny of us7 and us6

1035
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:20,320
then we find that all the gdt isotopes

1036
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:22,000
are grouped together

1037
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:23,519
but what's even more interesting is that

1038
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:26,480
us-22 is the root

1039
00:37:23,519 --> 00:37:26,800
of this so it's further data to support

1040
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:29,519
that

1041
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:31,119
us-22 could be apparent although this of

1042
00:37:29,519 --> 00:37:34,239
some of these genomes

1043
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:36,000
and then we see usa and us-24

1044
00:37:34,239 --> 00:37:38,399
that are together and they were very

1045
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:40,800
similar at least scenario

1046
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:41,519
but after looking at these trees some

1047
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:44,560
something i

1048
00:37:41,519 --> 00:37:45,519
call uh my grandma attention was the

1049
00:37:44,559 --> 00:37:47,759
fact that

1050
00:37:45,519 --> 00:37:49,599
all assets that you see up here are able

1051
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:52,160
to grow on potato and tomato

1052
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:54,240
whereas the ones that broke here almost

1053
00:37:52,159 --> 00:37:56,399
exclusively grow entertain

1054
00:37:54,239 --> 00:37:57,838
so this is really interesting because

1055
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:59,920
people have tried to

1056
00:37:57,838 --> 00:38:01,279
address this issue of post preference

1057
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:04,000
for a long time

1058
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:05,040
and there's almost like there's no clues

1059
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,119
of what's going on

1060
00:38:05,039 --> 00:38:09,039
but at least here we have hypotheses and

1061
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:09,280
we have a lot of markers that can help

1062
00:38:09,039 --> 00:38:11,519
us

1063
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:13,040
understand these differences in host

1064
00:38:11,519 --> 00:38:15,679
practices

1065
00:38:13,039 --> 00:38:18,079
so this is my last slide and these are

1066
00:38:15,679 --> 00:38:21,000
the conclusions of all of my work

1067
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:23,039
so first what we did we described the

1068
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,639
epidemiologically important phenotypic

1069
00:38:23,039 --> 00:38:28,000
traits for the most prevalent

1070
00:38:24,639 --> 00:38:29,199
genotypes in the us we documented that

1071
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:32,000
phytoplankton infested

1072
00:38:29,199 --> 00:38:33,519
is able to acquire resistance to in

1073
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:36,079
vitro and it's important in vitro

1074
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:38,400
because moles in this implant

1075
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:40,480
we found evidence that suggests that

1076
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:41,838
sexual reproduction might have occurred

1077
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:44,719
in the us

1078
00:38:41,838 --> 00:38:45,279
and this is important because right now

1079
00:38:44,719 --> 00:38:47,358
sexual

1080
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:50,160
reproduction is not dominant in the us

1081
00:38:47,358 --> 00:38:52,319
clearly but if it happens to become

1082
00:38:50,159 --> 00:38:54,159
common we're going to have to find

1083
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:56,559
genetic determinants to

1084
00:38:54,159 --> 00:38:57,598
to understand phenotypic traits of

1085
00:38:56,559 --> 00:38:59,519
interest

1086
00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:01,200
in order to make isolate specific

1087
00:38:59,519 --> 00:39:02,639
recommendations

1088
00:39:01,199 --> 00:39:05,519
and with that i would like to

1089
00:39:02,639 --> 00:39:08,000
acknowledge my community members

1090
00:39:05,519 --> 00:39:09,199
bill is the best advisor i could have

1091
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:12,320
ever dreamed of

1092
00:39:09,199 --> 00:39:15,838
and i'm really bad at this

1093
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:18,400
and i bet this helped me a lot with uh

1094
00:39:15,838 --> 00:39:19,119
with my current research and michael has

1095
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:21,680
also helped me

1096
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:24,079
a lot and chip helped me a lot with the

1097
00:39:21,679 --> 00:39:29,838
population

1098
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:29,839
and yeah

1099
00:39:39,838 --> 00:39:43,039
all welcome to colombia whenever you

1100
00:39:41,358 --> 00:39:44,880
want to come

1101
00:39:43,039 --> 00:39:47,119
this is very close to my house and it's

1102
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:49,920
like that all year long so

1103
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:50,880
if you ever want to have a christmas or

1104
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:53,519
winter break

1105
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:55,599
please please please come with me so i

1106
00:39:53,519 --> 00:39:57,280
think it's really appropriate that

1107
00:39:55,599 --> 00:40:00,559
somebody from a very warm climate should

1108
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:00,560
have for a visa seminar

1109
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:04,000
other questions

1110
00:40:07,519 --> 00:40:10,960
so is it still the case that you only

1111
00:40:09,519 --> 00:40:14,239
find a single

1112
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:15,440
clonal lineage for each farm or outbreak

1113
00:40:14,239 --> 00:40:18,479
or whatever

1114
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:21,760
okay ever find two in the same place

1115
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:24,318
so the question is if from a farm

1116
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:24,960
when we receive a sample from a leaf if

1117
00:40:24,318 --> 00:40:28,000
we find

1118
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:31,119
one single genotype or more than one so

1119
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:34,159
this year we found

1120
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:36,160
right this year we found two at least

1121
00:40:34,159 --> 00:40:36,879
two different genotypes in a single leaf

1122
00:40:36,159 --> 00:40:39,279
but

1123
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:40,240
that's very preliminary data so i don't

1124
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:42,480
know how much

1125
00:40:40,239 --> 00:40:44,399
we can talk about because i mean i guess

1126
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:44,800
what i'm getting at is the implications

1127
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,960
of

1128
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:48,960
getting a small sample from a farm and

1129
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:52,000
saying yes you can spray or not

1130
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:54,720
with ethanol yeah so

1131
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,440
i think i think that's why we really

1132
00:40:54,719 --> 00:40:57,439
have to put

1133
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:58,639
a lot of attention in what i'm currently

1134
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:00,800
working on because

1135
00:40:58,639 --> 00:41:01,679
it's a matter of time until sexual

1136
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:03,599
reproduction

1137
00:41:01,679 --> 00:41:05,279
can become dominant in the us i mean the

1138
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:07,200
two main types are here

1139
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:09,519
so we have been very lucky that

1140
00:41:07,199 --> 00:41:11,039
populations reproduce asexually mainly

1141
00:41:09,519 --> 00:41:12,318
and because of that we have been able to

1142
00:41:11,039 --> 00:41:15,358
manage the disease

1143
00:41:12,318 --> 00:41:18,838
easier but but i don't know if that's

1144
00:41:15,358 --> 00:41:20,239
going to be the case in ten or five

1145
00:41:18,838 --> 00:41:23,759
years

1146
00:41:20,239 --> 00:41:26,719
stuart do you have information

1147
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:26,720
as to whether

1148
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:36,559
in the um that you've seen over the

1149
00:41:35,039 --> 00:41:40,239
years

1150
00:41:36,559 --> 00:41:43,119
uh so the question is if i am aware of

1151
00:41:40,239 --> 00:41:45,838
any potatoes or seeds that might have

1152
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:47,440
implications in the population structure

1153
00:41:45,838 --> 00:41:51,519
of phytoplankton that we see year

1154
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:54,000
by year and i'm not aware of it and

1155
00:41:51,519 --> 00:41:55,519
it's it's hard to predict what assets

1156
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,639
are we're going to see next year but

1157
00:41:55,519 --> 00:41:59,280
there's a lot of

1158
00:41:56,639 --> 00:41:59,759
explanations for example tubers that are

1159
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:02,480
left

1160
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:04,319
in the field and perhaps the soil didn't

1161
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:06,800
get as cold so they survived or

1162
00:42:04,318 --> 00:42:08,719
volunteered plants that grow next year

1163
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:10,079
but about like a seed source that

1164
00:42:08,719 --> 00:42:12,959
disperses them i

1165
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:13,440
am not aware of it so i think we could

1166
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:16,400
ask

1167
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:18,720
keith and stewart if either of them

1168
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:19,440
knows the seed source from those potato

1169
00:42:18,719 --> 00:42:22,559
growers

1170
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:22,559
in western new york

1171
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:32,400
so first congratulations on a really

1172
00:42:30,559 --> 00:42:33,440
impressive body of work and an excellent

1173
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:36,639
seminar

1174
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:38,079
my question relates to the mating

1175
00:42:36,639 --> 00:42:39,679
it's not prevalent in the u.s it's

1176
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:41,440
prevalent in mexico

1177
00:42:39,679 --> 00:42:42,799
you say it's sort of a matter of luck

1178
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:44,639
and it's just a matter of time before we

1179
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:45,760
have

1180
00:42:44,639 --> 00:42:46,960
do you think it's luck or do you think

1181
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:48,160
there are environmental factors that

1182
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:51,039
affect me

1183
00:42:48,159 --> 00:42:51,519
anybody has looked at that i think it's

1184
00:42:51,039 --> 00:42:53,358
more

1185
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:54,639
of a matter i was okay so the question

1186
00:42:53,358 --> 00:42:58,480
was why

1187
00:42:54,639 --> 00:43:00,639
in mexico do we see like sexually

1188
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:02,079
reproduction occurring frequently and in

1189
00:43:00,639 --> 00:43:05,759
the us we do not

1190
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:08,560
so a very like a good example is europe

1191
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:09,040
in europe at the beginning isis migrated

1192
00:43:08,559 --> 00:43:11,599
from

1193
00:43:09,039 --> 00:43:12,318
the us running from mexico to the u.s

1194
00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:15,200
from u.s

1195
00:43:12,318 --> 00:43:17,599
to europe and during that migration

1196
00:43:15,199 --> 00:43:18,480
apparently no 82 main types went on the

1197
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:20,800
a1s

1198
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:21,760
so so in europe there was no sexual

1199
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:24,480
production happening

1200
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:27,119
then there was a second migration from

1201
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:28,719
mexico to europe and in that migration

1202
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:32,000
both a1s and atools

1203
00:43:28,719 --> 00:43:34,799
were sent to europe and because there

1204
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:37,519
were a lot of a to making types i think

1205
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:38,400
uh it's just chance of encountering i

1206
00:43:37,519 --> 00:43:40,318
think

1207
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:42,079
more than more than environmental i

1208
00:43:40,318 --> 00:43:44,239
think it's chan it's probability

1209
00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:45,440
if they survive and if they arrive and

1210
00:43:44,239 --> 00:43:48,559
if they increase or

1211
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:50,400
so places where it's 50 50 racial

1212
00:43:48,559 --> 00:43:51,920
have more chance of sexual reproduction

1213
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:52,880
than places where you see that one

1214
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:54,960
village is

1215
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:57,200
one main type is dominating over the

1216
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:57,199
other

1217
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:05,358
if you take a methanoxin tolerant

1218
00:44:02,239 --> 00:44:06,799
variance of let's say us-22 and then you

1219
00:44:05,358 --> 00:44:09,119
passages in one

1220
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:09,119
media

1221
00:44:12,719 --> 00:44:17,279
so we did that so our question is if we

1222
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:19,920
have the isos with our fire

1223
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:22,160
systems and then we transfer those

1224
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:24,240
through methanol some free media

1225
00:44:22,159 --> 00:44:25,358
if we lose the upper resistance so we

1226
00:44:24,239 --> 00:44:27,919
did that

1227
00:44:25,358 --> 00:44:28,719
up to three passages to refinancing free

1228
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:31,039
media

1229
00:44:28,719 --> 00:44:32,000
and we didn't lose it completely but if

1230
00:44:31,039 --> 00:44:34,239
you lose it

1231
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:35,358
but not complete so they are still

1232
00:44:34,239 --> 00:44:37,519
persistent

1233
00:44:35,358 --> 00:44:39,440
have you tried passaging them through

1234
00:44:37,519 --> 00:44:41,679
plants

1235
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:43,760
so we we tried to do that through plants

1236
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:46,318
but well there was a lot of variation

1237
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:46,960
i mean like sometimes the apart assisted

1238
00:44:46,318 --> 00:44:48,800
some

1239
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:50,318
assets sometimes grew on the plants

1240
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:52,318
sometimes they didn't the ones

1241
00:44:50,318 --> 00:44:53,679
with originally sensitive sometimes grew

1242
00:44:52,318 --> 00:44:56,159
sometimes didn't so we

1243
00:44:53,679 --> 00:44:59,759
so basically the answer is we don't know

1244
00:44:56,159 --> 00:44:59,759
we have to repeat those experiments and

1245
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:05,119
because then your question is did you

1246
00:45:02,239 --> 00:45:06,879
actually we all had said you sort of was

1247
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:08,480
seen implying that there was a mutation

1248
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:10,000
that was occurring you think this is

1249
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:12,159
actually a mutation

1250
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:14,159
you know that isn't basically is

1251
00:45:12,159 --> 00:45:16,318
selected for when you can put them on

1252
00:45:14,159 --> 00:45:17,519
you know it's one generation of this and

1253
00:45:16,318 --> 00:45:19,440
all of a sudden

1254
00:45:17,519 --> 00:45:21,920
where is it some sort of epigenetic kind

1255
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:22,800
of type modification of gene expression

1256
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:25,358
that's

1257
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:26,720
leading to the resistance so our

1258
00:45:25,358 --> 00:45:27,679
question is whether the acquire

1259
00:45:26,719 --> 00:45:30,318
resistance

1260
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:32,799
could be because of a mutation or

1261
00:45:30,318 --> 00:45:35,358
because of an epigenetic mechanism

1262
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:37,440
i personally think is an epigenetic

1263
00:45:35,358 --> 00:45:39,119
mechanism because it happens in multiple

1264
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:42,079
genotypes and in different

1265
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:43,920
individuals within genotypes so it's

1266
00:45:42,079 --> 00:45:46,400
highly unlikely that we get

1267
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:47,920
like the same typical mutations so many

1268
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:49,119
times and with a lot of different

1269
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:51,440
ingredients

1270
00:45:49,119 --> 00:45:53,519
but i have no idea what it is and we're

1271
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:55,039
trying travis talking in these days with

1272
00:45:53,519 --> 00:45:59,119
richard that is the undergrad

1273
00:45:55,039 --> 00:46:01,759
student that worked with me on that

1274
00:45:59,119 --> 00:46:03,599
here richard and we were really

1275
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:04,800
interested in doing like an apartment in

1276
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:08,079
my fire assistant

1277
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:11,039
to paper and analyzing this because now

1278
00:46:08,079 --> 00:46:13,519
i have dna data as well this genotype

1279
00:46:11,039 --> 00:46:14,559
so so i'm going i can make like much

1280
00:46:13,519 --> 00:46:17,920
more accurate

1281
00:46:14,559 --> 00:46:17,920
analysis of this

1282
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:22,079
a related question that is on on the you

1283
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:25,920
can't was it

1284
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:28,640
the screen 22 was secured a progenitor

1285
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:29,440
or all these gtx where these cigarette

1286
00:46:28,639 --> 00:46:31,519
strains were

1287
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:33,119
now you've got full genome sequencer

1288
00:46:31,519 --> 00:46:37,358
basically genome

1289
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:39,519
sort of sequence by genome by

1290
00:46:37,358 --> 00:46:42,880
data from throughout the genome 98 000

1291
00:46:39,519 --> 00:46:45,280
snips can you go through and look at

1292
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:47,440
the the segments within those different

1293
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:49,519
strains that don't match

1294
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:50,639
that you know the two strain because

1295
00:46:49,519 --> 00:46:52,239
then you could actually say

1296
00:46:50,639 --> 00:46:54,239
what because there's likely to be you

1297
00:46:52,239 --> 00:46:56,639
know a neighbor joining thing takes and

1298
00:46:54,239 --> 00:46:58,639
crunches all the genome down into one

1299
00:46:56,639 --> 00:47:00,318
single tree it ignores the fact that

1300
00:46:58,639 --> 00:47:00,719
different pieces of the genome have

1301
00:47:00,318 --> 00:47:04,719
actually

1302
00:47:00,719 --> 00:47:04,719
different phylogeny combinations

1303
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:10,880
okay so the question is what if now that

1304
00:47:08,719 --> 00:47:14,239
i have like all the data

1305
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:17,358
of of sequences of the whole genomes and

1306
00:47:14,239 --> 00:47:19,679
all the gdt's plus us 22 if i can go

1307
00:47:17,358 --> 00:47:21,759
over it and see like what parts of the

1308
00:47:19,679 --> 00:47:24,159
genome are shared and which ones are not

1309
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:25,680
we're doing or an evolutionary model

1310
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:26,480
because the tree i have here is a

1311
00:47:25,679 --> 00:47:28,639
distance tree

1312
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:29,920
so it doesn't really take into account

1313
00:47:28,639 --> 00:47:32,719
mutations or

1314
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:34,159
or models so yes if that's something

1315
00:47:32,719 --> 00:47:38,000
i've thought of but i haven't

1316
00:47:34,159 --> 00:47:40,078
i haven't started

1317
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,599
was wondering if you wanted to speculate

1318
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:44,160
on why

1319
00:47:41,599 --> 00:47:45,200
isolates become predominant and why

1320
00:47:44,159 --> 00:47:47,838
other isolates

1321
00:47:45,199 --> 00:47:49,039
disappear and presumably if you're

1322
00:47:47,838 --> 00:47:50,480
asking this question you have to think

1323
00:47:49,039 --> 00:47:52,880
of where they come from

1324
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:54,880
and in potatoes presumably that would be

1325
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:57,119
seed sources

1326
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:58,960
okay so i have i have talked to bill

1327
00:47:57,119 --> 00:48:01,119
about this um

1328
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:03,679
he tells me sometimes that i speculate a

1329
00:48:01,119 --> 00:48:07,039
little bit but this is my speculation

1330
00:48:03,679 --> 00:48:09,759
and it's like so if we go back to this

1331
00:48:07,039 --> 00:48:09,759
original

1332
00:48:12,159 --> 00:48:18,480
this figure we can see that sporulation

1333
00:48:15,679 --> 00:48:19,440
is much greater on tomatoes than a

1334
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:21,199
potato

1335
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:23,280
and that's why i've always thought that

1336
00:48:21,199 --> 00:48:24,078
being a pathogen that is able to grow on

1337
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:25,760
tomato is

1338
00:48:24,079 --> 00:48:27,119
really good like if i wear a pathogen i

1339
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:29,680
would want to go on

1340
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:31,680
on tomato because they really make a lot

1341
00:48:29,679 --> 00:48:32,639
of spores and potatoes because of the

1342
00:48:31,679 --> 00:48:34,558
tissue

1343
00:48:32,639 --> 00:48:36,719
it dies so quickly that the packaging is

1344
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:39,280
not able to sporulate that much

1345
00:48:36,719 --> 00:48:40,639
so the the good thing about being able

1346
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:42,240
to grow on a potato is that you can

1347
00:48:40,639 --> 00:48:44,159
survive on the tuber

1348
00:48:42,239 --> 00:48:45,919
because on the other hand tomatoes don't

1349
00:48:44,159 --> 00:48:47,039
survive very well in the winter or not

1350
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:49,119
at all

1351
00:48:47,039 --> 00:48:50,800
but if you're able to grow a tomato and

1352
00:48:49,119 --> 00:48:52,960
potato then you are like

1353
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:54,400
the best character so here i remember

1354
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:55,119
when we were doing this that i had

1355
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:57,039
already

1356
00:48:55,119 --> 00:48:58,318
i thought i told kids like who kept this

1357
00:48:57,039 --> 00:49:00,239
yours coming through i said

1358
00:48:58,318 --> 00:49:02,639
i know it's gonna be like around for a

1359
00:49:00,239 --> 00:49:03,519
while and and we see it today and it's

1360
00:49:02,639 --> 00:49:04,719
everywhere and

1361
00:49:03,519 --> 00:49:06,800
that was something that i was just

1362
00:49:04,719 --> 00:49:08,159
saying like to make fun because i loved

1363
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:10,318
doing this because there were so many

1364
00:49:08,159 --> 00:49:11,920
sports and i liked seeing that because

1365
00:49:10,318 --> 00:49:13,440
sometimes you never see anything like

1366
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:16,720
here and it's very boring

1367
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:18,639
so so i told that to and tolerate and

1368
00:49:16,719 --> 00:49:22,078
that was my reasoning but again

1369
00:49:18,639 --> 00:49:24,719
i mean u.s 22 disappeared completely

1370
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:28,000
it's probably because us 22 we saw that

1371
00:49:24,719 --> 00:49:29,598
it wasn't it was just in a few potatoes

1372
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:31,199
but it was mostly on tomatoes and

1373
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:32,000
because tomatoes do not survive the

1374
00:49:31,199 --> 00:49:34,239
winter then

1375
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:37,039
didn't have great chances of surviving

1376
00:49:34,239 --> 00:49:39,279
whereas the us-23

1377
00:49:37,039 --> 00:49:40,400
somehow happened to be in the potatoes

1378
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:44,000
so it probably

1379
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:47,200
arrived to the u.s potatoes or

1380
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:47,199
that's my speculation

1381
00:49:48,318 --> 00:49:55,838
well if i were oh yeah um

1382
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:59,838
i have you or can you look for a snip

1383
00:49:55,838 --> 00:49:59,838
that segregated

1384
00:50:09,519 --> 00:50:13,199
and so this is the problem with

1385
00:50:11,679 --> 00:50:15,838
phytoplankton okay doctors

1386
00:50:13,199 --> 00:50:16,558
draft genome has like a lot of scaffold

1387
00:50:15,838 --> 00:50:19,358
so if

1388
00:50:16,559 --> 00:50:21,200
i talker has 8 to 12 chromosomes but we

1389
00:50:19,358 --> 00:50:21,679
have no idea what the order of all of

1390
00:50:21,199 --> 00:50:24,960
this

1391
00:50:21,679 --> 00:50:27,279
are but if you see this there's like a

1392
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:28,639
locust that seems to be promised so this

1393
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:32,319
is a manhattan plot

1394
00:50:28,639 --> 00:50:35,279
so what i'm looking here is uh

1395
00:50:32,318 --> 00:50:36,400
scaffolds or like context of sequences

1396
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:38,640
and then

1397
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:40,000
here is the inverse in the log so the

1398
00:50:38,639 --> 00:50:42,719
more the higher it is the more

1399
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:44,639
significant it is so the more markers

1400
00:50:42,719 --> 00:50:46,558
you see that are significant is because

1401
00:50:44,639 --> 00:50:48,239
there's something happening there that

1402
00:50:46,559 --> 00:50:49,280
that it's called that it's making an

1403
00:50:48,239 --> 00:50:51,199
association

1404
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:53,040
and here we are comparing the a ones

1405
00:50:51,199 --> 00:50:55,358
versus the a to b

1406
00:50:53,039 --> 00:50:57,358
so if we eliminate all of this and just

1407
00:50:55,358 --> 00:51:01,039
keep the bigger scaffolds

1408
00:50:57,358 --> 00:51:02,799
we see this and we are and then we saw

1409
00:51:01,039 --> 00:51:05,039
some papers that had published

1410
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:06,960
they were doing a amplified fragment

1411
00:51:05,039 --> 00:51:08,000
polymorphisms and they had identified

1412
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:11,119
some loci that were

1413
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:12,639
present in the a1 but not in the a2 and

1414
00:51:11,119 --> 00:51:16,160
we did a pcr

1415
00:51:12,639 --> 00:51:18,879
uh in silicon pcr

1416
00:51:16,159 --> 00:51:20,159
and and we saw that it was some of the

1417
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:23,358
hits are in this

1418
00:51:20,159 --> 00:51:24,719
in this in this cathode so i mean this

1419
00:51:23,358 --> 00:51:30,078
very

1420
00:51:24,719 --> 00:51:30,078
beginning but we're we're trying to find

1421
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:33,679
well thank you very much giovanna i

1422
00:51:32,239 --> 00:51:37,838
think it's a really fun seminar

1423
00:51:33,679 --> 00:51:37,838
and uh are you sure

1424
00:51:45,679 --> 00:51:49,039
this has been a production of cornell

1425
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:55,440
university

1426
00:51:49,039 --> 00:51:55,440
