1
00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:09,509
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,218 --> 00:00:11,820
University so I'm gonna tell you a

3
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:13,679
journey that I feel is a little bit of a

4
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:16,440
two-fold journey because it's partially

5
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:18,600
a journey of me and my research and how

6
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:21,240
it progressed but I'm also gonna be

7
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:22,920
talking about the journey that sugar

8
00:00:21,239 --> 00:00:29,509
takes through a plant because I'm gonna

9
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:32,820
be talking about phloem transport so I

10
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:35,730
started my scientific career more in the

11
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:38,789
field of ecology and even my graduate

12
00:00:35,729 --> 00:00:42,259
research was asking ecological questions

13
00:00:38,789 --> 00:00:44,488
and trying to think about the different

14
00:00:42,259 --> 00:00:47,460
physiological factors the different

15
00:00:44,488 --> 00:00:50,159
aspects of plant stress tolerance that

16
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:52,679
influence where species occur across the

17
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:57,538
landscape so very sort of basic

18
00:00:52,679 --> 00:00:59,488
questions in terms of ecology and when I

19
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:03,798
was doing a lot of this work I kept

20
00:00:59,488 --> 00:01:06,450
finding what I felt was a familiar theme

21
00:01:03,798 --> 00:01:09,388
when you look at all the things that

22
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:11,819
influence the way that plants interact

23
00:01:09,388 --> 00:01:14,839
with the environment a lot of it has to

24
00:01:11,819 --> 00:01:18,990
do with resource allocation are they

25
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:22,170
investing in really stress tolerant

26
00:01:18,989 --> 00:01:24,919
structures do they have very dense wood

27
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:28,799
that can deal with drought conditions

28
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:31,799
how are they changing their growth rate

29
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:33,779
at different times of the year I was

30
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:35,579
doing work on wetland plants and root

31
00:01:33,778 --> 00:01:37,019
elongation was really important in

32
00:01:35,578 --> 00:01:38,938
determining where they were occurring

33
00:01:37,019 --> 00:01:41,248
and how fast they could establish at

34
00:01:38,938 --> 00:01:44,068
different sites and there's a lot of

35
00:01:41,248 --> 00:01:45,718
different aspects of carbon allocation

36
00:01:44,069 --> 00:01:48,599
or other kinds of nutrient allocation

37
00:01:45,718 --> 00:01:50,879
that impact the way that plants interact

38
00:01:48,599 --> 00:01:53,639
with other organisms and the way they

39
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:55,259
interact with each other and so through

40
00:01:53,638 --> 00:01:59,118
all this work it made me start thinking

41
00:01:55,259 --> 00:02:02,819
about well what is happening in terms of

42
00:01:59,118 --> 00:02:04,468
this allocation and specifically in

43
00:02:02,819 --> 00:02:06,509
terms of the carbon and I started

44
00:02:04,468 --> 00:02:08,579
thinking about how carbon is moved

45
00:02:06,509 --> 00:02:11,068
around the plants what do we know about

46
00:02:08,579 --> 00:02:12,340
this and how does it affect these larger

47
00:02:11,068 --> 00:02:14,469
processes

48
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:18,640
and so I got interested in studying the

49
00:02:14,469 --> 00:02:20,169
phloem and so this may all be reviewed

50
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:23,639
to you but I figured I'd take a moment

51
00:02:20,169 --> 00:02:27,098
and talk to you about how the phloem

52
00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:30,309
functions so the phloem is the part of

53
00:02:27,098 --> 00:02:35,679
the vascular system that transports

54
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:40,598
sugar and it operates in a very specific

55
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:42,790
mechanism it's very directional on one

56
00:02:40,598 --> 00:02:46,209
hand you have an area that's providing

57
00:02:42,789 --> 00:02:47,679
the sugar this is your source tissue it

58
00:02:46,209 --> 00:02:49,120
we often think of this as being the lead

59
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,650
because it's where photosynthesis is

60
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:53,860
happening but it can also be coming out

61
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:55,629
of storage and in that source tissue you

62
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:58,660
have the loading of a lot of sugars

63
00:02:55,629 --> 00:03:01,299
happening into the phloem and this is

64
00:02:58,659 --> 00:03:03,848
really important because it causes the

65
00:03:01,299 --> 00:03:05,049
phloem to have a high pressure you're

66
00:03:03,848 --> 00:03:07,568
gonna have a whole bunch of water move

67
00:03:05,049 --> 00:03:10,719
in after you have the loading of the

68
00:03:07,568 --> 00:03:12,369
sugar this pressure is important because

69
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:15,280
it's part of what drives phloem

70
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:17,500
transport so other parts of the plant

71
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:19,209
any place that's having active growth

72
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:22,659
this could be your roots this could be

73
00:03:19,209 --> 00:03:26,439
fruit this could be an apical meristem

74
00:03:22,659 --> 00:03:28,900
that's growing you're having a similar

75
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:31,209
but opposite phenomenon happening the

76
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:34,359
plants removing sugar from the system

77
00:03:31,209 --> 00:03:36,340
and so in this part of the plant you're

78
00:03:34,359 --> 00:03:39,099
pulling out the sugar and you're

79
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:42,669
reducing the pressure and so the plant

80
00:03:39,098 --> 00:03:44,500
causes this pressurized this pressure

81
00:03:42,669 --> 00:03:47,319
gradient that drives this circulation

82
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:50,199
from the source to the sink and this is

83
00:03:47,318 --> 00:03:55,388
the way that we think transport happens

84
00:03:50,199 --> 00:03:57,759
in the phloem now similar to the diagram

85
00:03:55,389 --> 00:03:59,560
that I've shown here you often will see

86
00:03:57,759 --> 00:04:02,709
pictures of the phloem that look like

87
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:06,969
this they look like a large pipe an

88
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:10,060
empty tube with these plates in between

89
00:04:06,969 --> 00:04:12,370
the cells but this is very stylized and

90
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:16,298
I always like to show a picture of what

91
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:19,840
the actual tissue looks like so this is

92
00:04:16,298 --> 00:04:21,679
a scanning electron micrograph of a cell

93
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:23,899
in the phloem

94
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:26,629
and the reason I like this picture is

95
00:04:23,899 --> 00:04:29,239
because it reminds us that this is a

96
00:04:26,629 --> 00:04:31,819
living tissue we're not talking about

97
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:34,850
pipes I'm gonna talk to you a little bit

98
00:04:31,819 --> 00:04:36,620
about models that you'd use and Flaum

99
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:39,379
transport how we think about it being

100
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:42,860
how we think about carbon moving in the

101
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:45,620
phloem but we have a system here of

102
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:47,689
interconnected living cells they have

103
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:49,310
fewer organelles than a lot of the

104
00:04:47,689 --> 00:04:51,589
neighbor neighboring cells but they do

105
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:54,949
have organelles and most importantly I

106
00:04:51,589 --> 00:04:56,478
would say they have a membrane and so

107
00:04:54,949 --> 00:04:58,430
this is something that's really

108
00:04:56,478 --> 00:05:01,129
important not just for how the phloem

109
00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:02,629
functions but it's also really important

110
00:05:01,129 --> 00:05:03,680
in explaining why we don't know much

111
00:05:02,629 --> 00:05:07,189
about the phloem

112
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:10,519
so we have a system that is pressurized

113
00:05:07,189 --> 00:05:13,339
that's surrounded by a membrane so that

114
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:15,918
means if you manipulate it if you cut it

115
00:05:13,339 --> 00:05:19,969
you can influence not only how it

116
00:05:15,918 --> 00:05:22,819
functions but where everything is inside

117
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:25,220
of it and so for a long time there's

118
00:05:22,819 --> 00:05:27,829
been a lot of debates about what even

119
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:31,430
the phloem looks like in an intact

120
00:05:27,829 --> 00:05:34,519
system and so one thing I'm really

121
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:37,280
interested in is trying to understand

122
00:05:34,519 --> 00:05:40,879
the connection this basic connection

123
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:43,309
between structure and function it's it's

124
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:45,769
sort of a you know the baseline when you

125
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:48,379
get into physiology but it's something

126
00:05:45,769 --> 00:05:51,168
we don't really understand that well in

127
00:05:48,379 --> 00:05:53,149
the phone so you can think about this in

128
00:05:51,168 --> 00:05:56,198
a lot of different levels you know

129
00:05:53,149 --> 00:05:59,029
plants have complex three-dimensional

130
00:05:56,199 --> 00:06:02,120
architecture and different branching

131
00:05:59,029 --> 00:06:05,029
patterns this we can imagine how this

132
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:07,250
would impact where carbon can move how

133
00:06:05,029 --> 00:06:09,168
it can move and growth patterns but we

134
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:11,810
don't understand the connections that

135
00:06:09,168 --> 00:06:14,990
lie there you can think about on a

136
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:18,560
tissue level there's a lot of variation

137
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:20,569
in what florrum looks like and how much

138
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:23,689
different plants have and where it's

139
00:06:20,569 --> 00:06:26,538
located and we do not have a good idea

140
00:06:23,689 --> 00:06:31,579
of what that means in terms of plant

141
00:06:26,538 --> 00:06:35,180
growth reproduction or even just

142
00:06:31,579 --> 00:06:36,889
patterns of carbon movement in the plant

143
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:39,470
and when you get down to this cellular

144
00:06:36,889 --> 00:06:42,410
level so here you know we're looking at

145
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:45,680
those tubes with the individual cells

146
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:48,199
that are separated by plates there's a

147
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:50,990
large amount of variation among species

148
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:53,180
and what the cells look like they vary

149
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:56,509
in what the plates look like they vary

150
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:58,069
in how large the tubes are and we don't

151
00:06:56,509 --> 00:06:59,750
understand the implications of this

152
00:06:58,069 --> 00:07:01,879
we're just starting to scratch the

153
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:04,370
surface on some of these pretty basic

154
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:07,219
questions in trying to understand it

155
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:10,189
understand the design of the phloem why

156
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:13,490
why does it work so well and what are

157
00:07:10,189 --> 00:07:16,009
the implications of it and so what I

158
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:17,478
want to talk to you about today is three

159
00:07:16,009 --> 00:07:19,550
different projects that I've worked on

160
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:21,168
that are trying to get at this this

161
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:24,050
connection between structure and

162
00:07:21,168 --> 00:07:27,469
function and I've organized this in

163
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:30,288
terms of three different questions so

164
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:33,020
I've been curious thinking about how

165
00:07:30,288 --> 00:07:36,019
does phloem physiology and Anatomy

166
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:39,620
impact how much carbon can be moved in a

167
00:07:36,019 --> 00:07:43,609
plant how far it can be moved and when

168
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:45,879
it can be moved and so I'm gonna start

169
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:48,288
with the very seasoned the appropriate

170
00:07:45,879 --> 00:07:51,259
first one which is work on pumpkins

171
00:07:48,288 --> 00:07:55,879
right so it's almost Halloween so I had

172
00:07:51,259 --> 00:07:58,269
to talk about pumpkins and I got

173
00:07:55,879 --> 00:08:00,889
interested in this because I was curious

174
00:07:58,269 --> 00:08:03,589
what happens when you have a plant

175
00:08:00,889 --> 00:08:06,408
that's allocating a lot of Carman really

176
00:08:03,589 --> 00:08:08,629
rapidly to on developing structure and

177
00:08:06,408 --> 00:08:11,509
so so look at this I didn't look at just

178
00:08:08,629 --> 00:08:17,089
any pumpkin I figured I wanted to find

179
00:08:11,509 --> 00:08:20,900
the biggest pumpkins so I did my work on

180
00:08:17,089 --> 00:08:22,728
giant pumpkins and I had the pleasure of

181
00:08:20,899 --> 00:08:25,848
working with the New England giant

182
00:08:22,728 --> 00:08:28,339
pumpkin growers and these are many of

183
00:08:25,848 --> 00:08:29,990
the growers that I worked with I also

184
00:08:28,339 --> 00:08:35,598
did this work in collaboration with

185
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:38,180
Missy Holbrook and Dustin Haines and so

186
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:40,039
I started thinking about these giant

187
00:08:38,179 --> 00:08:43,609
pumpkins and trying to understand and

188
00:08:40,038 --> 00:08:45,769
figure out how they're able to move so

189
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:47,379
much carbon into this developing

190
00:08:45,769 --> 00:08:53,730
structure

191
00:08:47,379 --> 00:08:56,889
so what I did is I decided to compare

192
00:08:53,730 --> 00:09:00,550
different types or different varieties

193
00:08:56,889 --> 00:09:02,319
of this species so giant pumpkins are

194
00:09:00,549 --> 00:09:05,169
all in the species cucurbit of Maxima

195
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:07,660
you might know this species from Hubbard

196
00:09:05,169 --> 00:09:09,339
squash there's a lot of squashes that

197
00:09:07,659 --> 00:09:11,919
have the same species they're just

198
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:13,960
different variety so this giant pumpkin

199
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:17,649
is not related to the field pumpkin that

200
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:20,500
you typically know but it's been under

201
00:09:17,649 --> 00:09:23,889
very strong selection for over the last

202
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:25,960
century for size because people have

203
00:09:23,889 --> 00:09:30,689
been competitively growing pumpkins in

204
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:32,710
this country since the early 1900s and

205
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:34,720
gradually over time we've seen an

206
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:37,090
increase in the size of these pumpkins

207
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:39,670
one of the big breakthroughs was in the

208
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:42,129
1970s we had the development of the

209
00:09:39,669 --> 00:09:45,250
Atlantic giant variety this is the

210
00:09:42,129 --> 00:09:48,070
variety that is used in almost all of

211
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:52,450
the giant pumpkin competitions nowadays

212
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:54,160
and I I'm not sure it could be that this

213
00:09:52,450 --> 00:09:56,410
very moment this records being broken it

214
00:09:54,159 --> 00:09:58,509
gets broken very quickly so it's hard to

215
00:09:56,409 --> 00:10:00,399
keep it up to date and it's the time of

216
00:09:58,509 --> 00:10:03,939
season but the world record is somewhere

217
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:09,730
around 2600 pounds so these can grow

218
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:11,410
very large all right so to understand

219
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:13,720
what's happening with giant pumpkins I

220
00:10:11,409 --> 00:10:16,419
decided I wanted to look at several

221
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:18,910
varieties urban and maxima and look at

222
00:10:16,419 --> 00:10:21,459
their phloem from source to sink so

223
00:10:18,909 --> 00:10:25,269
thinking about their leaves all the way

224
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:27,250
to the fruit and I picked two giant

225
00:10:25,269 --> 00:10:29,470
varieties so the Atlantic giant or the

226
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:31,809
competitive ones there are mammoth ones

227
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:33,639
which are another smaller but also giant

228
00:10:31,809 --> 00:10:35,709
pumpkin variety and the Hubbard squash

229
00:10:33,639 --> 00:10:37,960
so these are all the same species but

230
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:41,560
they invest different amounts in their

231
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:43,090
fruit and I grew all of these in a

232
00:10:41,559 --> 00:10:45,129
greenhouse so most of the work I'm going

233
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:47,410
to talk to you about is green house work

234
00:10:45,129 --> 00:10:48,939
but then I was also able to work with

235
00:10:47,409 --> 00:10:51,370
the giant pumpkin growers and get data

236
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:52,660
from field ground giant pumpkins to add

237
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:57,220
to it and I'll talk to you a little bit

238
00:10:52,659 --> 00:10:59,379
about what I found in that so the first

239
00:10:57,220 --> 00:11:00,790
thing I started doing was looking at

240
00:10:59,379 --> 00:11:02,200
some of the basics

241
00:11:00,789 --> 00:11:05,469
is there a difference in how much they

242
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:09,190
photosynthesize there isn't so on a

243
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:11,500
source level in terms of carbon being

244
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:14,350
fixed it's similar among all the

245
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:16,899
varieties I looked at some aspects of

246
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:19,750
the fruit especially the young ovaries

247
00:11:16,899 --> 00:11:21,939
and despite the fact that the Hubbard

248
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:24,759
squash had a slightly different shape

249
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:27,250
and color actually remarkably similar

250
00:11:24,759 --> 00:11:29,889
the cell sizes in the tissues are the

251
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:33,309
same the same water content in carbon

252
00:11:29,889 --> 00:11:38,679
content same mass very similar early

253
00:11:33,309 --> 00:11:41,739
trajectory of their growth I also wanted

254
00:11:38,679 --> 00:11:44,319
to look at how much carbon is being

255
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:47,680
moved in the phloem and I looked at this

256
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:49,690
in the leaves so I've done some work on

257
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:53,169
who turbines in the past where I have

258
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:55,360
measured phloem transport using a

259
00:11:53,169 --> 00:11:58,000
fluorescent dye that we can get into the

260
00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:00,759
phloem and by doing this and using

261
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:03,789
really sensitive light sensors can

262
00:12:00,759 --> 00:12:05,529
actually detect movement in an intact

263
00:12:03,789 --> 00:12:07,509
plant so you actually don't have to cut

264
00:12:05,529 --> 00:12:10,389
into the plant or disturb anything and

265
00:12:07,509 --> 00:12:13,470
so I was able to do this on the leaves

266
00:12:10,389 --> 00:12:15,789
of these different pumpkin species and

267
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:17,470
the same as when I looked at

268
00:12:15,789 --> 00:12:21,240
photosynthesis when you look at the

269
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:24,220
amount of carbon so this is the

270
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:26,169
volumetric transport in these three

271
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:28,740
different varieties out of the leaves

272
00:12:26,169 --> 00:12:30,879
the exporting the same amount of carbon

273
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:33,850
all right so there's not a difference

274
00:12:30,879 --> 00:12:37,870
here you're starting to notice a pattern

275
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:39,460
I looked at the cells there's also not a

276
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:42,070
difference there so you look at the

277
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:44,910
cells and the phloem you look at these

278
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:49,960
are the plates that separate the cells

279
00:12:44,909 --> 00:12:52,779
same size same pore size the transport

280
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:59,710
cells are same in all the varieties

281
00:12:52,779 --> 00:13:01,990
right yes yes so it's one species and

282
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:03,970
all these varieties so huge difference

283
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:07,450
in what's happening with the growth of

284
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:09,399
the fruit at the end but a lot of

285
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:14,740
similarities right so what's what's

286
00:13:09,399 --> 00:13:16,509
going on here well I did find one

287
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:20,409
distinct difference that was really

288
00:13:16,509 --> 00:13:23,139
strong between these varieties and it

289
00:13:20,409 --> 00:13:25,419
had to do with the amount of flow that

290
00:13:23,139 --> 00:13:27,639
they had so when you looked at a

291
00:13:25,419 --> 00:13:31,509
cellular level the cells were the same

292
00:13:27,639 --> 00:13:33,429
but they had more of them so this is the

293
00:13:31,509 --> 00:13:35,590
cross sectional area of the flow um I

294
00:13:33,429 --> 00:13:37,269
have it here in the pedestal I also

295
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:39,280
looked at it in the stem and the petiole

296
00:13:37,269 --> 00:13:42,309
these patterns are true really

297
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:45,069
throughout the whole plant when you look

298
00:13:42,309 --> 00:13:47,500
at the two giant varieties they have

299
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:49,810
about three percent more phloem than the

300
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:52,029
non giant variety and the field grown

301
00:13:49,809 --> 00:13:53,739
ones have even higher now I can't

302
00:13:52,029 --> 00:13:55,720
differentiate between whether this is a

303
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:59,740
genetic effect of it being more of an

304
00:13:55,720 --> 00:14:01,360
award-winning genotype or whether it's

305
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:04,360
driven by the environmental effects of

306
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:06,430
being grown in a field but these three

307
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:11,139
varieties were all grown in the same

308
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:13,959
conditions so what this looks like is

309
00:14:11,139 --> 00:14:16,809
happening is there has been a big shift

310
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:19,720
in the giant pumpkins from other

311
00:14:16,809 --> 00:14:21,789
varieties Cucurbita Maxima in the amount

312
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:26,200
of film that they actually have inside

313
00:14:21,789 --> 00:14:27,819
of their tissue now in addition to that

314
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:30,610
there are some interesting differences

315
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:32,950
that are in the way the phloem is

316
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:34,330
structured and I always put this out

317
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:36,220
when I talk about this maybe somebody

318
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:39,280
here knows more about this and I do I

319
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:41,350
just find it a little bit odd

320
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:44,649
I always think acute carbons is having

321
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:47,050
very consistent vascular structure these

322
00:14:44,649 --> 00:14:49,240
giant varieties even when their fruits

323
00:14:47,049 --> 00:14:51,939
are at a young age start having some

324
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:54,129
irregularities so you would often see

325
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:56,470
vascular bundles appearing in the middle

326
00:14:54,129 --> 00:14:58,269
of the cortex which could create these

327
00:14:56,470 --> 00:15:01,060
strings in the center of the stem and

328
00:14:58,269 --> 00:15:04,120
the pumpkin or you start having really

329
00:15:01,059 --> 00:15:06,789
weird vascular and your regular basket

330
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:08,500
arrangement so it's it's a little bit of

331
00:15:06,789 --> 00:15:10,269
an interesting pattern and along in

332
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:12,519
addition to having more phloem the way

333
00:15:10,269 --> 00:15:18,850
it's arranged starts changing especially

334
00:15:12,519 --> 00:15:22,240
as they get bigger so I was curious to

335
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:25,120
try to understand this shift this 3%

336
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:26,830
shift in the amount of phloem does it

337
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:28,278
actually matter does it make a

338
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:31,189
difference

339
00:15:28,278 --> 00:15:35,059
to get at this I actually worked with

340
00:15:31,188 --> 00:15:37,730
the pumpkin growers to model carbon

341
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:39,708
transport into the pumpkins and so the

342
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:41,480
pumpkin growers are really careful at

343
00:15:39,708 --> 00:15:44,539
grow measuring the dimensions of their

344
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:47,089
pumpkins often daily sometimes it's more

345
00:15:44,539 --> 00:15:49,308
weekly and they've got very detailed

346
00:15:47,089 --> 00:15:52,430
charts about how weight relates to size

347
00:15:49,308 --> 00:15:55,100
and so you can look at these growth

348
00:15:52,429 --> 00:15:57,828
trajectories for all of these pumpkins

349
00:15:55,100 --> 00:16:01,069
and I was also able to get samples from

350
00:15:57,828 --> 00:16:04,789
some of the field grown plants to get an

351
00:16:01,068 --> 00:16:07,248
idea of how much water and carbon and

352
00:16:04,789 --> 00:16:08,629
how much phloem there was in the plants

353
00:16:07,249 --> 00:16:14,959
at each of their stages during

354
00:16:08,629 --> 00:16:16,759
development and so it's pretty amazing

355
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:18,859
when you start getting into this we know

356
00:16:16,759 --> 00:16:20,240
these are large pumpkins not surprising

357
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:22,519
when you start looking at the date and

358
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:25,129
you realize they can grow 20 kilograms a

359
00:16:22,519 --> 00:16:28,578
day it's a little bit mind-boggling at

360
00:16:25,129 --> 00:16:31,069
least to me in terms of carbon that's

361
00:16:28,578 --> 00:16:33,289
could be somewhere around 600 grams of

362
00:16:31,068 --> 00:16:38,870
carbon can be moving into the pumpkin in

363
00:16:33,289 --> 00:16:42,318
one day and so I use the data that I had

364
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:44,600
to actually look at transport velocity I

365
00:16:42,318 --> 00:16:46,729
was curious how fast does carbon moving

366
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:48,379
into these pumpkins and that's what

367
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:52,100
we're seeing here this is transport

368
00:16:48,379 --> 00:16:53,240
velocity with mass and I'm you know we

369
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:55,040
could we could talk for a while about

370
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:57,049
the trends and if there's a trend and

371
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:59,870
I'm not going to go into that what I

372
00:16:57,049 --> 00:17:01,490
want to draw attention to is some of the

373
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:02,959
numbers that we're looking at which may

374
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:05,209
not have meaning to you unless you've

375
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:09,558
actually measured a lot of phloem

376
00:17:05,209 --> 00:17:12,949
transport the thing to note is that in

377
00:17:09,558 --> 00:17:15,139
any literature I found on cue turbines

378
00:17:12,949 --> 00:17:18,919
so going beyond pumpkins talking about

379
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:20,870
cucumbers they all have a foam transport

380
00:17:18,919 --> 00:17:24,020
velocity that tends to average somewhere

381
00:17:20,869 --> 00:17:27,259
in this range it's really common they're

382
00:17:24,019 --> 00:17:29,929
around point one to point one and that's

383
00:17:27,259 --> 00:17:32,179
where this falls out and what's

384
00:17:29,929 --> 00:17:33,980
interesting is if you go into this model

385
00:17:32,179 --> 00:17:35,780
and you ask the question what happens if

386
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:37,190
we decrease the cross-sectional area of

387
00:17:35,779 --> 00:17:40,129
phloem so that it's more like the

388
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:42,350
Hubbard squash you would have to have

389
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:45,289
velocities that are normal

390
00:17:42,349 --> 00:17:47,329
three times larger and these are larger

391
00:17:45,288 --> 00:17:50,210
than anything we've ever measured in a

392
00:17:47,329 --> 00:17:53,480
cubit now they're not beyond the range

393
00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:56,919
that we've seen in other plants but this

394
00:17:53,480 --> 00:18:02,870
makes you think it makes me think right

395
00:17:56,919 --> 00:18:04,519
about what's going on here and so you

396
00:18:02,869 --> 00:18:07,369
know getting to this question with giant

397
00:18:04,519 --> 00:18:10,490
pumpkins it seems like what's happening

398
00:18:07,369 --> 00:18:12,500
is these pumpkins are able to move a lot

399
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:15,409
of carbon into that developing fruit

400
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:16,819
because they have more phloem if you

401
00:18:15,409 --> 00:18:17,870
want to think about this in terms of a

402
00:18:16,819 --> 00:18:20,509
simple equation

403
00:18:17,869 --> 00:18:22,069
you've got the area of the phloem the

404
00:18:20,509 --> 00:18:25,089
transport velocity and that's going to

405
00:18:22,069 --> 00:18:29,058
determine that volumetric flow rate and

406
00:18:25,089 --> 00:18:31,548
so they are increasing the area but the

407
00:18:29,058 --> 00:18:36,500
velocity seems to be saying similar into

408
00:18:31,548 --> 00:18:38,119
the fruit and to me this is interesting

409
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:39,319
because it creates another question

410
00:18:38,119 --> 00:18:41,268
right so this is what makes the most

411
00:18:39,319 --> 00:18:45,379
exciting research I think is when you're

412
00:18:41,269 --> 00:18:48,109
left with a bigger question and so what

413
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:52,850
I see when I look at this is a question

414
00:18:48,109 --> 00:18:56,329
about transport capacity why is it that

415
00:18:52,849 --> 00:18:58,459
cue cards don't just increase the flow

416
00:18:56,329 --> 00:19:02,210
through those tubes is there a limit to

417
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:04,278
how fast they can move carbon with their

418
00:19:02,210 --> 00:19:04,880
Anatomy and that's something we don't

419
00:19:04,278 --> 00:19:08,269
know

420
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:12,409
but the fact that the strategy that we

421
00:19:08,269 --> 00:19:13,009
see here for increasing flow rate into a

422
00:19:12,409 --> 00:19:15,679
pumpkin

423
00:19:13,009 --> 00:19:18,379
results from more tissue instead of

424
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:22,669
increased capacity of transport in those

425
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:25,429
tissue to me makes me wonder about what

426
00:19:22,669 --> 00:19:27,590
is actually happening and how does cue

427
00:19:25,429 --> 00:19:30,350
kerbin Anatomy influence bone transport

428
00:19:27,589 --> 00:19:35,658
velocity so that's a question that I'm

429
00:19:30,349 --> 00:19:39,319
hoping to look at more in the future all

430
00:19:35,659 --> 00:19:42,620
right so now for something very

431
00:19:39,319 --> 00:19:44,148
different completely I like to jump

432
00:19:42,619 --> 00:19:46,189
around systems so maybe there's a little

433
00:19:44,148 --> 00:19:49,369
bit for everyone I'm hoping we're gonna

434
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:51,730
go from talking about pumpkins and a

435
00:19:49,369 --> 00:19:55,549
more of an agricultural system to

436
00:19:51,730 --> 00:20:01,279
talking about trees and vines

437
00:19:55,549 --> 00:20:04,609
so there's been a lot of ongoing debate

438
00:20:01,279 --> 00:20:07,460
and discussion about how plants are able

439
00:20:04,609 --> 00:20:09,169
to move carbon really long distances you

440
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:11,509
know some tree is king and 100 meters

441
00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:18,470
tall it's a long distance to move from

442
00:20:11,509 --> 00:20:20,960
the canopy to the roots and this is

443
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:22,250
especially a challenging thing to think

444
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:24,319
about when you're thinking about the

445
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:27,410
mechanism that I explained right we're

446
00:20:24,319 --> 00:20:30,079
having a situation where just these

447
00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:34,400
local osmotic gradients are creating a

448
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:36,519
pressure that's driving passively carbon

449
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:41,330
movement the whole length of the plant

450
00:20:36,519 --> 00:20:43,039
and as you increase the length of that

451
00:20:41,329 --> 00:20:45,799
pathway you should be increasing the

452
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:49,039
resistance this is basics of fluid flow

453
00:20:45,799 --> 00:20:52,039
through a pipe if that's the case then

454
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:54,349
as you grow taller you wouldn't be able

455
00:20:52,039 --> 00:20:56,210
to move as much and trees would have

456
00:20:54,349 --> 00:20:58,189
slower and slower and slower carbon

457
00:20:56,210 --> 00:21:00,350
transport and this this is a little bit

458
00:20:58,190 --> 00:21:01,940
problematic to the way that we think

459
00:21:00,349 --> 00:21:04,909
about growth and the way that we think

460
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:08,000
about the vascular system and so I

461
00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:10,610
worked in collaboration with Missy again

462
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:13,400
and also Michael Knobloch at Washington

463
00:21:10,609 --> 00:21:16,009
State to try to get at this question and

464
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:18,710
we started initially in a system that

465
00:21:16,009 --> 00:21:21,710
was a little simpler than trees we

466
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:25,819
started with a Morning Glory all right

467
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:28,700
and what we wanted to do with the

468
00:21:25,819 --> 00:21:30,200
Morning Glory was measure basically as

469
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:34,730
much as we could about the phloem and

470
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:37,940
see if we could get the numbers to add

471
00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:39,799
up right we have this theory about how

472
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:41,330
phloem transport happens what happens if

473
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:44,299
we measure everything that goes into

474
00:21:41,329 --> 00:21:46,669
those equations does it actually work

475
00:21:44,299 --> 00:21:49,490
and does it change as you increase the

476
00:21:46,670 --> 00:21:51,560
length of the plant and so here I've

477
00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:54,769
given you just a simple equation for

478
00:21:51,559 --> 00:21:56,299
flow some of you may be familiar this

479
00:21:54,769 --> 00:21:58,639
some of you may not but bear with me

480
00:21:56,299 --> 00:22:00,619
it's pretty straight for it so when

481
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:03,590
you're having pressure driven flow the

482
00:22:00,619 --> 00:22:05,149
velocity how fast it can move is going

483
00:22:03,589 --> 00:22:06,799
to be related to the pressure gradient

484
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:08,740
so this is the pressure between the

485
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:10,509
source and the sink and

486
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:13,599
whatever the resistance is in the tissue

487
00:22:10,509 --> 00:22:15,940
and this is going to be influenced by

488
00:22:13,599 --> 00:22:18,490
the height of the tree the viscosity of

489
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:23,200
the solution is going to be influenced

490
00:22:18,490 --> 00:22:25,089
by the anatomy of the tubes and so there

491
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:27,788
was a large group of us that were in

492
00:22:25,089 --> 00:22:30,069
Missy and Michael's lab at all through

493
00:22:27,788 --> 00:22:32,740
everything we could at this just to give

494
00:22:30,069 --> 00:22:35,558
you an idea of some of the people and

495
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:38,230
some of the stuff that was involved

496
00:22:35,558 --> 00:22:42,308
we measured phloem transport velocity

497
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:46,890
using c11 we did a lot of detailed

498
00:22:42,308 --> 00:22:49,450
microscopy work we collaborated with

499
00:22:46,890 --> 00:22:53,860
physicists who helped us model it core

500
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:56,980
Jennsen we estimated velocity sorry

501
00:22:53,859 --> 00:23:01,689
viscosity inside of sieve tubes using

502
00:22:56,980 --> 00:23:04,000
molecular rotors and we used some newly

503
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:06,750
developed pressure gauges to measure

504
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,919
pressure in the different tissues and

505
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:10,569
what we found was really interesting

506
00:23:08,919 --> 00:23:12,940
they're sort of two key things that

507
00:23:10,569 --> 00:23:14,589
jumped out when we looked at this trying

508
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:16,480
to understand what's actually happening

509
00:23:14,589 --> 00:23:18,189
in terms of all of these different

510
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:20,110
factors as a plant's growing taller like

511
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:24,640
are they actually slowing down their

512
00:23:20,109 --> 00:23:27,129
carbon transport or not well one of the

513
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:29,799
things that we found was that that

514
00:23:27,130 --> 00:23:33,789
pressure inside of the leaves increased

515
00:23:29,798 --> 00:23:36,788
as the morning glories got taller so

516
00:23:33,788 --> 00:23:39,250
here is a little schematic of it we

517
00:23:36,788 --> 00:23:40,869
altered the the length harshly by

518
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:43,179
manipulating where the lowest leaf was

519
00:23:40,869 --> 00:23:47,319
and so the longest difference between a

520
00:23:43,179 --> 00:23:49,630
source and a sink on a whole handful of

521
00:23:47,319 --> 00:23:53,048
plants and we measured pressure in the

522
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:58,510
phloem at those top leaves and what we

523
00:23:53,048 --> 00:24:00,398
find is that as you get to be longer at

524
00:23:58,509 --> 00:24:01,960
least if you're a Morning Glory the

525
00:24:00,398 --> 00:24:05,199
pressure inside of the phloem and the

526
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:07,149
leaf increases so this is really cool

527
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:09,370
it's suggesting well maybe these plants

528
00:24:07,148 --> 00:24:12,699
are compensating by just pressurizing

529
00:24:09,369 --> 00:24:16,869
their phloem more but this wasn't the

530
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:18,159
only difference that we saw that wasn't

531
00:24:16,869 --> 00:24:21,250
the only thing that happened is the

532
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:22,400
plants grew taller another thing that

533
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:28,130
happened is

534
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:29,870
anatomy changed so these are the same

535
00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:33,980
plates that connect the cells in the

536
00:24:29,869 --> 00:24:36,889
phloem and as you go from the top to the

537
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:38,960
bottom of one of these tall plants you

538
00:24:36,890 --> 00:24:41,540
will find that those plates get more and

539
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:44,420
more complex and they have more and more

540
00:24:41,539 --> 00:24:48,230
parts and the pores are bigger and the

541
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:50,810
tubes are bigger so the anatomy of the

542
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:53,750
plant is actually changing as the plants

543
00:24:50,809 --> 00:24:55,730
growing and that's really important when

544
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:59,269
we're thinking about resistance of a

545
00:24:55,730 --> 00:25:01,490
tooth if you ever want to make water

546
00:24:59,269 --> 00:25:04,609
move faster through a tube make that

547
00:25:01,490 --> 00:25:07,490
tube wider a the simplest simplest thing

548
00:25:04,609 --> 00:25:10,009
you can do and so having these kinds of

549
00:25:07,490 --> 00:25:12,710
structural changes we think are really

550
00:25:10,009 --> 00:25:14,839
important in allowing these plants to

551
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:16,970
transport over longer distance because

552
00:25:14,839 --> 00:25:20,980
it decreases that a resistance that

553
00:25:16,970 --> 00:25:24,890
they're experiencing so this is really

554
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:26,809
cool and great and everything but to me

555
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:29,509
the question was well hello this morning

556
00:25:26,809 --> 00:25:32,720
gorg it's still just 14 meters it's not

557
00:25:29,509 --> 00:25:34,759
really as big as plants can get and it's

558
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:40,130
also this hurt it's it's an herbaceous

559
00:25:34,759 --> 00:25:42,799
or herbaceous plant and we know that

560
00:25:40,130 --> 00:25:45,290
there is there are differences in

561
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:52,329
species in what's happening in that

562
00:25:45,289 --> 00:25:52,329
phloem loading zone and a lot of trees

563
00:25:52,539 --> 00:25:58,789
appear to have a more passive loading

564
00:25:55,369 --> 00:26:01,759
system in terms of how they move sugar

565
00:25:58,789 --> 00:26:03,259
into the phloem and this is important

566
00:26:01,759 --> 00:26:05,599
when we're thinking about this

567
00:26:03,259 --> 00:26:07,789
phenomenon that we saw in the morning

568
00:26:05,599 --> 00:26:10,609
glory so the morning glories show this

569
00:26:07,789 --> 00:26:13,819
ability to increase the pressure in

570
00:26:10,609 --> 00:26:16,069
their phloem and our best thought is

571
00:26:13,819 --> 00:26:18,769
that this has to do with the fact that

572
00:26:16,069 --> 00:26:20,539
they actively load sugars into their

573
00:26:18,769 --> 00:26:24,170
phloem and so there is a control

574
00:26:20,539 --> 00:26:27,920
mechanism there for potentially altering

575
00:26:24,170 --> 00:26:30,590
the pressure in the tissue but with a

576
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:32,690
lot of trees they rely just on a

577
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:35,599
concentration gradient from the mess of

578
00:26:32,690 --> 00:26:38,808
mesophyll into the phloem and this

579
00:26:35,599 --> 00:26:40,490
and a system is hard to imagine it's

580
00:26:38,808 --> 00:26:43,970
hard to imagine that it could pressurize

581
00:26:40,490 --> 00:26:48,079
easily may you know maybe it can

582
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:49,370
but our suspicion was is that that they

583
00:26:48,079 --> 00:26:53,359
weren't doing the same thing as the

584
00:26:49,369 --> 00:26:56,329
morning glories and so I led a project

585
00:26:53,359 --> 00:26:58,579
to look specifically at trees we looked

586
00:26:56,329 --> 00:27:01,699
at nine different species to try to see

587
00:26:58,579 --> 00:27:04,759
what was happening and how phloem and

588
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:07,038
aadmi changed with height and so we

589
00:27:04,759 --> 00:27:08,509
looked at a lot of the same things we

590
00:27:07,038 --> 00:27:10,819
looked at the other ones so these are

591
00:27:08,509 --> 00:27:13,279
those longitudinal sections looking at

592
00:27:10,819 --> 00:27:15,649
the plates using scan Electrike Moss

593
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:18,710
microscopy to look more detail at the

594
00:27:15,650 --> 00:27:23,750
plates we sampled trees and multiple

595
00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:25,069
Heights and we found a very similar

596
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:29,269
pattern to what we saw in the morning

597
00:27:25,069 --> 00:27:31,220
glory in terms of their Anatomy so we

598
00:27:29,269 --> 00:27:34,788
found that this is the bottom of a tree

599
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:38,630
and the top of a tree the tubes were

600
00:27:34,788 --> 00:27:43,190
bigger at the bottom they were often

601
00:27:38,630 --> 00:27:46,340
more pores in the plates the pores and

602
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:48,470
the plates were bigger and so what this

603
00:27:46,339 --> 00:27:50,899
is suggesting is that as trees are

604
00:27:48,470 --> 00:27:53,079
getting taller the same as morning

605
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:55,970
glories are getting bigger the new

606
00:27:53,079 --> 00:27:58,970
vascular tissue they're making is larger

607
00:27:55,970 --> 00:28:02,870
and can move more and so they're

608
00:27:58,970 --> 00:28:05,710
adjusting as they're growing and this is

609
00:28:02,869 --> 00:28:10,399
is really important because it helps

610
00:28:05,710 --> 00:28:12,529
prevent issues with growing tall it

611
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:14,990
would be very inefficient if you could

612
00:28:12,529 --> 00:28:20,139
only grow a few meters before your

613
00:28:14,990 --> 00:28:36,788
transport of carbon became slow right

614
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:36,789
yeah no that's a great question or

615
00:28:38,890 --> 00:28:44,330
probably both so we're I'm not going to

616
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:47,869
talk about the work that we've done

617
00:28:44,329 --> 00:28:49,339
within the same species but when they're

618
00:28:47,869 --> 00:28:52,669
smaller they all

619
00:28:49,339 --> 00:28:59,059
have smaller conduits but there is some

620
00:28:52,670 --> 00:29:01,160
variation between species in how big the

621
00:28:59,059 --> 00:29:03,859
conduits and that does seem to relate to

622
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:06,740
size so it could be that there's a

623
00:29:03,859 --> 00:29:12,679
little bit of both in there but that's a

624
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:14,420
great question so here's here's what

625
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:16,100
some of the data looks like and I'm

626
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:17,570
gonna explain this to you because it's a

627
00:29:16,099 --> 00:29:19,909
little bit counterintuitive if you

628
00:29:17,569 --> 00:29:23,689
haven't looked at many crafts of scaling

629
00:29:19,910 --> 00:29:26,060
relationships so this is resistance okay

630
00:29:23,690 --> 00:29:30,559
so this makes sense higher resistance

631
00:29:26,059 --> 00:29:32,659
would mean slower transport right and we

632
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:36,919
do this as distance from the top of the

633
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:40,240
tree so at the base of the tallest trees

634
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:42,890
the resistance is the lower lowest and

635
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:44,900
as you go towards the top of the trees

636
00:29:42,890 --> 00:29:49,009
and as you move towards shorter trees

637
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:50,630
the resistance gets higher and it looks

638
00:29:49,009 --> 00:29:53,509
like from what we can tell the

639
00:29:50,630 --> 00:29:56,080
relationship within a plant within a

640
00:29:53,509 --> 00:29:59,450
species is the same as a cross species

641
00:29:56,079 --> 00:30:01,119
seems to be a pretty constant scaling

642
00:29:59,450 --> 00:30:05,090
relationship that we see and how

643
00:30:01,119 --> 00:30:08,839
resistance scales with height which is

644
00:30:05,089 --> 00:30:11,119
which is really exciting but of course

645
00:30:08,839 --> 00:30:13,459
the thing that it leaves us with is this

646
00:30:11,119 --> 00:30:15,250
question of is it enough right the

647
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:19,220
Morning Glory had to do this and more

648
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:21,109
what are the trees doing more is then

649
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:23,660
anatomical changes we're seeing here

650
00:30:21,109 --> 00:30:27,979
enough to allow for transport and really

651
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:30,860
tall trees so to get at this we also

652
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:32,809
went back to modeling because there are

653
00:30:30,859 --> 00:30:35,179
some things that unfortunately we just

654
00:30:32,809 --> 00:30:36,559
can't always measure but the modeling

655
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:40,220
gives us a nice framework for how to

656
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:43,269
think about what's going on and so these

657
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:46,160
are some basic models of the phloem

658
00:30:43,269 --> 00:30:49,160
looking at how we would expect pressure

659
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:50,660
to change with different Anatomy so if

660
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:52,490
you had a situation where there was no

661
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:53,850
change in Anatomy along the length of a

662
00:30:52,490 --> 00:30:57,960
tree as

663
00:30:53,849 --> 00:31:00,740
you got taller you would need to have a

664
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:04,829
really high pressure okay

665
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:07,200
but if you put into the model this same

666
00:31:04,829 --> 00:31:09,029
scaling relationship that we saw where

667
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:10,558
resistance actually just decreases

668
00:31:09,029 --> 00:31:15,000
because the tubes get bigger and the

669
00:31:10,558 --> 00:31:17,009
pores get bigger it drops off and you

670
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:21,720
don't ever need those really high

671
00:31:17,009 --> 00:31:25,230
pressures and so we wanted to know

672
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:28,288
whether this was in the range of what

673
00:31:25,230 --> 00:31:30,179
you could find in the leaf of a tree in

674
00:31:28,288 --> 00:31:31,619
terms of the pressure is that reasonable

675
00:31:30,179 --> 00:31:36,210
can a tree achieve that much pressure

676
00:31:31,619 --> 00:31:38,069
and to do this oh I forgot there is this

677
00:31:36,210 --> 00:31:39,779
I was gonna explain these two lines so

678
00:31:38,069 --> 00:31:41,730
we did make some differences in our

679
00:31:39,779 --> 00:31:43,259
assumptions about the cross sectional

680
00:31:41,730 --> 00:31:45,230
area of the phloem it's a little bit

681
00:31:43,259 --> 00:31:47,730
complicated to measure this in a tree

682
00:31:45,230 --> 00:31:53,250
but it doesn't matter much for the

683
00:31:47,730 --> 00:31:57,150
actual pattern we here but we decided to

684
00:31:53,250 --> 00:32:00,679
try to measure pressure in leaves on

685
00:31:57,150 --> 00:32:02,850
intact trees so we built a scaffolding

686
00:32:00,679 --> 00:32:05,580
we used a bucket truck we brought a

687
00:32:02,849 --> 00:32:07,288
microscope up to the canopy and use

688
00:32:05,579 --> 00:32:09,089
these little peeko gauges this work was

689
00:32:07,288 --> 00:32:11,640
done primarily by Yann and Michel

690
00:32:09,089 --> 00:32:17,308
Knobloch to actually measure pressure in

691
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:21,720
leads in tall trees and what we found

692
00:32:17,308 --> 00:32:24,710
was the oak that we studied had a

693
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:27,659
pressure that was close to a mega Pascal

694
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:30,329
which is completely within the range

695
00:32:27,659 --> 00:32:33,690
that we would that would be would make

696
00:32:30,329 --> 00:32:35,699
transport feasible with this Anatomy so

697
00:32:33,690 --> 00:32:38,190
what this suggests is the changes that

698
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:42,179
we're seeing in the anatomy these

699
00:32:38,190 --> 00:32:47,460
changes in trees in terms of the

700
00:32:42,179 --> 00:32:50,669
resistance is enough to allow tall trees

701
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:54,240
to transport really long distances

702
00:32:50,669 --> 00:32:57,299
without much pressure The Morning Glory

703
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:58,859
seems to have this added capability to

704
00:32:57,298 --> 00:33:01,288
pressurize its phloem which is also

705
00:32:58,859 --> 00:33:03,298
helping as it along gates and so where

706
00:33:01,288 --> 00:33:05,400
we're having these really interesting

707
00:33:03,298 --> 00:33:07,210
changes that are facilitating long

708
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:11,110
distance transport in

709
00:33:07,210 --> 00:33:13,240
the phloem and so as I mentioned we're

710
00:33:11,109 --> 00:33:15,519
also doing some work within species now

711
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:17,230
we're doing work on Oaks different sizes

712
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:19,660
to try to understand what happens as

713
00:33:17,230 --> 00:33:21,610
plants develop and we also have a larger

714
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:25,840
data set of about 50 species that

715
00:33:21,609 --> 00:33:27,569
include more vines and trees and herbs

716
00:33:25,839 --> 00:33:31,089
to get another understanding on how

717
00:33:27,569 --> 00:33:34,029
height impacts a whole variety of these

718
00:33:31,089 --> 00:33:36,909
different organisms and what their

719
00:33:34,029 --> 00:33:41,829
phloem looks like so stay tuned there

720
00:33:36,910 --> 00:33:44,100
will be more coming on about this so the

721
00:33:41,829 --> 00:33:46,809
last thing I want to leave you with is

722
00:33:44,099 --> 00:33:51,069
some work that I'm more recently getting

723
00:33:46,809 --> 00:33:54,399
into and this is just the beginning

724
00:33:51,069 --> 00:33:56,589
phases of it but I have become really

725
00:33:54,400 --> 00:34:00,300
interested in what happens seasonally in

726
00:33:56,589 --> 00:34:03,789
plants and how they change and

727
00:34:00,299 --> 00:34:05,649
specifically how the carbon transport

728
00:34:03,789 --> 00:34:07,450
system change and so once again I've

729
00:34:05,650 --> 00:34:09,250
gone back full circle instead of going

730
00:34:07,450 --> 00:34:11,079
to fruit I'm gonna go to flowers but

731
00:34:09,250 --> 00:34:16,269
thinking again about transport into a

732
00:34:11,079 --> 00:34:19,150
specific organ as its developing and so

733
00:34:16,269 --> 00:34:21,099
there's a sort of a battering of

734
00:34:19,150 --> 00:34:22,630
research out there on what happens to

735
00:34:21,099 --> 00:34:25,719
the phloem in the winter there's not a

736
00:34:22,630 --> 00:34:28,360
lot of information on this there was

737
00:34:25,719 --> 00:34:31,059
some great classic work done using a

738
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:33,220
fits to collect phloem samples and

739
00:34:31,059 --> 00:34:35,380
looking at the concentration of sugars

740
00:34:33,219 --> 00:34:37,179
that suggests in the winter

741
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:40,420
sugar concentrations get higher in the

742
00:34:37,179 --> 00:34:41,919
SAP of the phloem so not necessarily

743
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:43,539
surprising it might be what you would

744
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:46,630
expect compared to what's happening in

745
00:34:43,539 --> 00:34:48,730
the rest of the plant there's also been

746
00:34:46,630 --> 00:34:52,119
a lot of anatomical work looking at

747
00:34:48,730 --> 00:34:53,800
kalos deposition and sometimes this is

748
00:34:52,119 --> 00:34:57,190
deposited and then dissolved in the

749
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:59,740
spring sometimes it appears that plants

750
00:34:57,190 --> 00:35:03,039
just forsake their phloem from that year

751
00:34:59,739 --> 00:35:05,919
and don't reuse it the next year but

752
00:35:03,039 --> 00:35:08,559
regardless the way you look at it phloem

753
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:09,880
transport likely decreases in the winter

754
00:35:08,559 --> 00:35:13,539
in most species either because of

755
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:15,599
viscosity or because of occlusion and

756
00:35:13,539 --> 00:35:18,759
because they're just not moving as much

757
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:20,159
so to me this begs the question of well

758
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:24,490
what's happening in the spring

759
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:26,980
right and I got interested in this

760
00:35:24,489 --> 00:35:28,989
because I have had a lifelong level

761
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:30,610
Boulos and I've done a lot of work on

762
00:35:28,989 --> 00:35:34,299
them and I love the fact that they

763
00:35:30,610 --> 00:35:36,070
flower so early in the spring and there

764
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:38,140
are a lot of plants both in our

765
00:35:36,070 --> 00:35:40,480
horticultural and our natural landscape

766
00:35:38,139 --> 00:35:43,719
that do this often the first growth we

767
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:45,550
see is flowers so this made me start

768
00:35:43,719 --> 00:35:47,889
wondering about well what's happening in

769
00:35:45,550 --> 00:35:50,200
the phloem of these species how are they

770
00:35:47,889 --> 00:35:51,879
actually growing these new organs

771
00:35:50,199 --> 00:35:55,329
sometimes when there's still snow in the

772
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:58,390
ground in the spring and so I've been

773
00:35:55,329 --> 00:36:00,429
doing work on five just different gener

774
00:35:58,389 --> 00:36:03,219
here I and what I've done is I have

775
00:36:00,429 --> 00:36:05,109
pairs of species that flower really

776
00:36:03,219 --> 00:36:06,549
early without their leaves so they

777
00:36:05,110 --> 00:36:08,890
flower precociously

778
00:36:06,550 --> 00:36:11,440
and ones that flower later with their

779
00:36:08,889 --> 00:36:12,940
leaves but they're in the same genus so

780
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:15,550
I can try to separate out what's

781
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:17,590
happening in terms of the flowers and in

782
00:36:15,550 --> 00:36:18,850
the leaves in development and so I'm

783
00:36:17,590 --> 00:36:22,570
just going to show you a little bit of

784
00:36:18,849 --> 00:36:25,239
the work they've been doing on this so

785
00:36:22,570 --> 00:36:27,910
I've been trying to think about when and

786
00:36:25,239 --> 00:36:29,759
how is carbon moving into this bud this

787
00:36:27,909 --> 00:36:32,949
is where I started with just a simple

788
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:34,870
simple thought all right these all have

789
00:36:32,949 --> 00:36:37,210
preformed flowers they make them the

790
00:36:34,869 --> 00:36:41,319
year before in the summer but they're

791
00:36:37,210 --> 00:36:43,240
not at full size so there's some certain

792
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:46,660
amount of carbon flux there's gonna

793
00:36:43,239 --> 00:36:48,729
period of dormancy and then in the

794
00:36:46,659 --> 00:36:51,869
spring they're gonna have more carbon

795
00:36:48,730 --> 00:36:54,099
flux as they grow and I wanted to know

796
00:36:51,869 --> 00:36:56,799
what's happening in terms of the timing

797
00:36:54,099 --> 00:36:58,449
of this and how much carbon is is moving

798
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:00,370
in there and so the first thing I did is

799
00:36:58,449 --> 00:37:03,909
I just looked at biomass and carbon

800
00:37:00,369 --> 00:37:08,829
content of the tissues and this is some

801
00:37:03,909 --> 00:37:11,920
of the data here so this is the floral

802
00:37:08,829 --> 00:37:15,819
biomass but we're looking at the biomass

803
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:18,099
as a percentage of the total flower so

804
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:20,920
if you take a dormant bud and you say

805
00:37:18,099 --> 00:37:22,809
how much does that weigh and what

806
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:24,849
percentage of the final weight of the

807
00:37:22,809 --> 00:37:26,170
flower is that dormant but this gives

808
00:37:24,849 --> 00:37:28,449
you an idea of how much does it actually

809
00:37:26,170 --> 00:37:30,250
have to grow in the spring so the

810
00:37:28,449 --> 00:37:33,259
dormant buds for exam of the Hema

811
00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:35,000
malleus the witch-hazel are almost nine

812
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:37,340
percent of the final weight of the flour

813
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:39,260
they show very little growth in the

814
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:43,970
spring almost everything they need to

815
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:45,020
flour is there or they get dormant but

816
00:37:43,969 --> 00:37:48,049
with the other species it's more

817
00:37:45,019 --> 00:37:50,320
variable and the interesting thing that

818
00:37:48,050 --> 00:37:53,510
came out when I just did this simple

819
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:55,580
look at these different pairs is that

820
00:37:53,510 --> 00:37:58,700
there's a big difference based on when

821
00:37:55,579 --> 00:38:00,650
you flour and in some ways maybe this

822
00:37:58,699 --> 00:38:02,529
also seems intuitive but these plants

823
00:38:00,650 --> 00:38:04,789
that are flowering really early are

824
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:08,930
investing much more of their carbon a

825
00:38:04,789 --> 00:38:11,570
year prior to flowering then the ones

826
00:38:08,929 --> 00:38:13,190
that flower later so the darker purple

827
00:38:11,570 --> 00:38:15,170
here you can see they're all larger for

828
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:18,679
each species and I put some pictures

829
00:38:15,170 --> 00:38:21,320
here of the dissected buds and these are

830
00:38:18,679 --> 00:38:25,159
all at the same scale so this is a

831
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:27,980
precocious early flowering cornice this

832
00:38:25,159 --> 00:38:29,539
is a non precocious same with a Magnolia

833
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:31,280
and the Salix this was consistent across

834
00:38:29,539 --> 00:38:34,279
all of the groups that I've looked at

835
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:36,220
the ones that flower early always invest

836
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:41,380
more carbon in their buds

837
00:38:36,219 --> 00:38:41,379
prior to dormancy prior to the winter

838
00:38:43,719 --> 00:38:50,779
now that being said none of them besides

839
00:38:47,869 --> 00:38:52,819
Tama MELAS is pretty borderline put all

840
00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:55,220
their carbon in so they all need their

841
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:57,220
phloem in the spring or that's what all

842
00:38:55,219 --> 00:38:59,899
the evidence suggests and I actually

843
00:38:57,219 --> 00:39:02,869
tried to test this by looking at

844
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:05,119
girdling I girdled these branches remove

845
00:39:02,869 --> 00:39:07,219
the phloem to see what happened and when

846
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:08,929
you girdle them they don't increase in

847
00:39:07,219 --> 00:39:11,209
biomass so there's no growth in the

848
00:39:08,929 --> 00:39:12,409
spring they might still bloom but

849
00:39:11,210 --> 00:39:13,909
they're gonna be tiny and they're gonna

850
00:39:12,409 --> 00:39:16,960
be the same weight as they were doing

851
00:39:13,909 --> 00:39:21,699
dormancy so it seems like they need

852
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:24,769
active phloem in them and they actually

853
00:39:21,699 --> 00:39:26,329
probably require the phloem for more

854
00:39:24,769 --> 00:39:29,119
than just the carbon so I spent almost

855
00:39:26,329 --> 00:39:31,250
this whole talk talking about carbon but

856
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:33,500
that carbon comes in an aqueous solution

857
00:39:31,250 --> 00:39:35,119
it comes in water and when you're

858
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:38,000
talking about small structures that

859
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:39,109
don't use a lot of water the phloem can

860
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:42,110
actually be really important in

861
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:45,289
hydrating them and so I did some models

862
00:39:42,110 --> 00:39:46,849
looking at how much water you need based

863
00:39:45,289 --> 00:39:50,480
on the measurements I took of the bud

864
00:39:46,849 --> 00:39:52,969
for those flowers to expand and for most

865
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:55,309
of the species there is enough water in

866
00:39:52,969 --> 00:39:58,579
the phloem to hydrate those flowers

867
00:39:55,309 --> 00:40:00,289
prior to blooming prior tan pieces all

868
00:39:58,579 --> 00:40:01,819
right so it looks like the phloem could

869
00:40:00,289 --> 00:40:03,889
be what's supporting these flowers

870
00:40:01,820 --> 00:40:06,440
really early in the spring and I

871
00:40:03,889 --> 00:40:08,750
actually did this model too I just want

872
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:13,480
to mention with different assumptions

873
00:40:08,750 --> 00:40:15,469
about respiration because I didn't have

874
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:17,240
temporal measurements of respiration

875
00:40:15,469 --> 00:40:20,659
during the entire span of floral

876
00:40:17,239 --> 00:40:23,359
development and the if you if you assume

877
00:40:20,659 --> 00:40:26,960
there was no respiration handful of

878
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:28,340
species came out as not having enough

879
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:30,139
water in their phloem to hydrate the

880
00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:32,570
flowers but as soon as you put even a

881
00:40:30,139 --> 00:40:35,059
low rate of respiration there was maybe

882
00:40:32,570 --> 00:40:36,920
one there was one species left and if

883
00:40:35,059 --> 00:40:40,820
you got a little bit higher there were

884
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:44,360
none so I would say that the phloem

885
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:46,269
should be at least able to supply 60% of

886
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:48,410
the water that these flowers need

887
00:40:46,269 --> 00:40:55,009
possibly all of the water they need

888
00:40:48,409 --> 00:40:56,869
during development so that's a great

889
00:40:55,010 --> 00:41:00,680
question so with this work I've been

890
00:40:56,869 --> 00:41:05,359
focusing on just up into an thesis when

891
00:41:00,679 --> 00:41:09,559
they open the only one that I believe

892
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:11,240
has store mates is the Magnolia and I

893
00:41:09,559 --> 00:41:14,269
have a graduate student actually right

894
00:41:11,239 --> 00:41:16,399
now looking at floral loss through

895
00:41:14,269 --> 00:41:18,230
through these different structures and

896
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:20,539
what happens after in theses because I

897
00:41:18,230 --> 00:41:22,579
think after that after they open and

898
00:41:20,539 --> 00:41:27,469
those petals are exposed the whole story

899
00:41:22,579 --> 00:41:30,139
changes yep so so this as I say is just

900
00:41:27,469 --> 00:41:31,789
an ongoing project but I mentioned

901
00:41:30,139 --> 00:41:32,809
before how I have my favorite projects

902
00:41:31,789 --> 00:41:35,029
the ones that leave two more questions

903
00:41:32,809 --> 00:41:37,369
and this leaves the big question because

904
00:41:35,030 --> 00:41:39,650
I just gave you some tidbits I said the

905
00:41:37,369 --> 00:41:42,170
phloem seems active in the spring it's

906
00:41:39,650 --> 00:41:44,690
supplying carbon and water but to me

907
00:41:42,170 --> 00:41:46,639
this is really intriguing those plants

908
00:41:44,690 --> 00:41:48,889
that flower early invest more of their

909
00:41:46,639 --> 00:41:50,750
carbon the year before that tells me

910
00:41:48,889 --> 00:41:52,219
there's there's probably some

911
00:41:50,750 --> 00:41:54,139
restriction on phloem transport in the

912
00:41:52,219 --> 00:41:56,629
spring so maybe they don't have a big

913
00:41:54,139 --> 00:41:58,730
enough window to transport or maybe

914
00:41:56,630 --> 00:42:00,300
they're transporting at a slower rate

915
00:41:58,730 --> 00:42:01,740
and so this is something

916
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:03,870
we're currently looking in to try to

917
00:42:01,739 --> 00:42:05,489
actually what's happening in terms of

918
00:42:03,869 --> 00:42:08,460
transport into these flowers in the

919
00:42:05,489 --> 00:42:10,529
spring but you know that will come at a

920
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:13,470
later time hopefully I'll have more

921
00:42:10,530 --> 00:42:17,100
answers and more questions so so with

922
00:42:13,469 --> 00:42:18,719
that just to wrap it up you know I hope

923
00:42:17,099 --> 00:42:20,849
I gave you a little bit of a hint of

924
00:42:18,719 --> 00:42:24,449
some of the cool questions that are out

925
00:42:20,849 --> 00:42:26,039
there I in no way claimed to have

926
00:42:24,449 --> 00:42:28,019
answered this question I think we are

927
00:42:26,039 --> 00:42:29,489
just scratching the surface in terms of

928
00:42:28,019 --> 00:42:31,920
the connection between the structure and

929
00:42:29,489 --> 00:42:33,449
function in the phloem but we'll we

930
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:35,430
ended up with at the end of all this

931
00:42:33,449 --> 00:42:37,619
it's a lot of really cool questions so

932
00:42:35,429 --> 00:42:39,089
if there's anybody out here looking for

933
00:42:37,619 --> 00:42:44,369
cool research projects on the phone

934
00:42:39,090 --> 00:42:45,840
there's a lot of them out there so with

935
00:42:44,369 --> 00:42:48,150
that I'd like to thank you for your

936
00:42:45,840 --> 00:43:15,059
attention and I can take any questions

937
00:42:48,150 --> 00:43:17,730
that you have is the same then they

938
00:43:15,059 --> 00:43:21,329
either are completely for the more

939
00:43:17,730 --> 00:43:27,690
leaves which just either branching horn

940
00:43:21,329 --> 00:43:28,559
or so yeah so the one thing I know so

941
00:43:27,690 --> 00:43:30,570
this is a little complicated because

942
00:43:28,559 --> 00:43:32,369
most of the plants I was growing never

943
00:43:30,570 --> 00:43:34,230
got to the size in a greenhouse you

944
00:43:32,369 --> 00:43:36,900
can't grow them as big so I don't know

945
00:43:34,230 --> 00:43:39,240
if you grew like a Hubbard squash under

946
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:41,970
the exact same conditions as a Atlantic

947
00:43:39,239 --> 00:43:44,369
giant in the field weather would produce

948
00:43:41,969 --> 00:43:46,139
more in the greenhouse they were

949
00:43:44,369 --> 00:43:47,730
remarkably similar but they showed a big

950
00:43:46,139 --> 00:43:50,129
difference in their pattern of

951
00:43:47,730 --> 00:43:53,639
allocation to their fruit in terms of

952
00:43:50,130 --> 00:43:57,720
how many fruits versus how big and so it

953
00:43:53,639 --> 00:44:02,099
might be more of a trade-off at that

954
00:43:57,719 --> 00:44:04,649
level I'm not sure but without actually

955
00:44:02,099 --> 00:44:06,719
growing the Hubbard squash and pushing

956
00:44:04,650 --> 00:44:09,420
them to the extent that those Atlantic

957
00:44:06,719 --> 00:44:12,239
Giants are pushed I'm not sure that we

958
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:13,769
could see at that scale does that make

959
00:44:12,239 --> 00:44:20,338
sense

960
00:44:13,769 --> 00:44:23,519
yeah it could be and so the other thing

961
00:44:20,338 --> 00:44:26,070
they do there's a lot of practices they

962
00:44:23,519 --> 00:44:29,480
do during giant pumpkin growing and they

963
00:44:26,070 --> 00:44:32,190
do a lot of very careful pruning and

964
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:36,210
maintenance and planning about the whole

965
00:44:32,190 --> 00:44:38,369
plant and how it is put out and the

966
00:44:36,210 --> 00:44:41,309
problem that that there is with these

967
00:44:38,369 --> 00:44:43,710
field grown ones as they all use the one

968
00:44:41,309 --> 00:44:45,690
variety so to convince somebody to put

969
00:44:43,710 --> 00:44:46,889
that much effort into doing experiments

970
00:44:45,690 --> 00:44:49,650
of a whole bunch of different ones is

971
00:44:46,889 --> 00:44:51,389
really would be really hard but there's

972
00:44:49,650 --> 00:44:53,099
a lot of thing I could definitely

973
00:44:51,389 --> 00:44:55,799
believe that there's something going on

974
00:44:53,099 --> 00:45:06,390
typical dominance or branch hanging for

975
00:44:55,800 --> 00:45:08,519
sure it's a great point no it's a great

976
00:45:06,389 --> 00:45:15,329
question and I wish I had an answer for

977
00:45:08,519 --> 00:45:16,530
it but I don't so I I a while ago

978
00:45:15,329 --> 00:45:18,420
participated in a study where we

979
00:45:16,530 --> 00:45:19,710
actually compiled a lot of data from the

980
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:21,269
literature and we're trying to get an

981
00:45:19,710 --> 00:45:25,559
idea of how variable sugar

982
00:45:21,269 --> 00:45:27,269
concentrations are in the phloem and the

983
00:45:25,559 --> 00:45:28,679
the problem that we have is there's a

984
00:45:27,269 --> 00:45:32,759
lot of methods that people use for

985
00:45:28,679 --> 00:45:36,088
measuring this and it's not clear how

986
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:41,310
equivalent they are and so there's a lot

987
00:45:36,088 --> 00:45:43,049
of debate in general about whether like

988
00:45:41,309 --> 00:45:45,088
a particular study that showed a really

989
00:45:43,050 --> 00:45:47,760
low or really high concentration is

990
00:45:45,088 --> 00:45:49,588
actually realistic she should always be

991
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:51,930
in the middle and so the default is

992
00:45:49,588 --> 00:45:54,299
often in our models to do what the

993
00:45:51,929 --> 00:45:57,449
average is where we see it it's also the

994
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:59,310
concentration that's that's sort of

995
00:45:57,449 --> 00:46:03,569
optimal for transport in terms of

996
00:45:59,309 --> 00:46:04,858
viscosity but I mean the work that I

997
00:46:03,570 --> 00:46:06,510
showed you the Fisher showed that the

998
00:46:04,858 --> 00:46:09,630
seasonal changes shows that it does

999
00:46:06,510 --> 00:46:11,820
change it's likely not the same all the

1000
00:46:09,630 --> 00:46:13,500
time and we don't know we don't know how

1001
00:46:11,820 --> 00:46:20,400
much it differs between species and how

1002
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:23,269
dynamic it is yeah do you have any

1003
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:23,269
questions

1004
00:46:24,650 --> 00:46:33,389
this is generic I'm

1005
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:35,489
wondering what other molecules you

1006
00:46:33,389 --> 00:46:37,889
measure with the transport whether it

1007
00:46:35,489 --> 00:46:40,440
was just carbon or whether you included

1008
00:46:37,889 --> 00:46:43,348
nutrients like potassium and easy 'm

1009
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:45,269
other things are actively transported in

1010
00:46:43,349 --> 00:46:47,309
the phloem to see if there was any

1011
00:46:45,268 --> 00:46:51,028
correlation between the carbon that was

1012
00:46:47,309 --> 00:46:55,019
transported and and and these nutrients

1013
00:46:51,028 --> 00:46:59,429
and we also have RNA and all kinds of

1014
00:46:55,018 --> 00:47:02,639
other things that are moving so any

1015
00:46:59,429 --> 00:47:05,219
hints about that yeah yeah it's a great

1016
00:47:02,639 --> 00:47:08,518
question I have not I focused primarily

1017
00:47:05,219 --> 00:47:10,439
on carbon and sugars I know that it's a

1018
00:47:08,518 --> 00:47:11,939
really active and interesting area of

1019
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:14,338
research as a lot of things that are

1020
00:47:11,940 --> 00:47:17,568
transported in the phloem that have huge

1021
00:47:14,338 --> 00:47:20,278
implications for how plants function so

1022
00:47:17,568 --> 00:47:23,210
yeah I think it's be a great thing to

1023
00:47:20,278 --> 00:47:23,210
look at more in the future

1024
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:41,068
it so I've actually gotten different

1025
00:47:39,108 --> 00:47:43,679
opinions on this when I've talked to

1026
00:47:41,068 --> 00:47:47,358
people who do more of the modeling and

1027
00:47:43,679 --> 00:47:47,358
who study physics since long transport

1028
00:47:48,498 --> 00:47:56,759
generally the thought is that it doesn't

1029
00:47:50,699 --> 00:47:58,919
matter a lot because of you have to get

1030
00:47:56,759 --> 00:48:05,460
really tall to have it be a significant

1031
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:06,630
impact and most plants with the

1032
00:48:05,460 --> 00:48:09,119
exception of some of these really tall

1033
00:48:06,630 --> 00:48:11,430
trees do not have those really long

1034
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:13,829
different distances between a source and

1035
00:48:11,429 --> 00:48:15,018
a sink where you would be tall enough

1036
00:48:13,829 --> 00:48:17,400
that gravity would have a big impact

1037
00:48:15,018 --> 00:48:21,718
it's possible that in really tall trees

1038
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:25,150
it has some impacts but it's not clear

1039
00:48:21,719 --> 00:48:27,800
to me how much of an impact

1040
00:48:25,150 --> 00:48:30,220
we have time for one more question if

1041
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:30,220
there is one

1042
00:48:35,170 --> 00:49:01,369
yeah within the same cult or depending

1043
00:48:52,730 --> 00:49:03,050
on how the winter goes over yeah no it's

1044
00:49:01,369 --> 00:49:04,819
an interesting question I mean I I sort

1045
00:49:03,050 --> 00:49:06,620
of present this as it being black and

1046
00:49:04,820 --> 00:49:08,680
white and it's it's not even for some of

1047
00:49:06,619 --> 00:49:11,960
the species that I've used it depends on

1048
00:49:08,679 --> 00:49:13,519
it seems to depend on even just the

1049
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:15,619
micro environment they're growing in in

1050
00:49:13,519 --> 00:49:19,130
addition to yearly variation how much

1051
00:49:15,619 --> 00:49:22,130
the flowers and leaves overlap and I

1052
00:49:19,130 --> 00:49:24,860
don't know exactly what's going on what

1053
00:49:22,130 --> 00:49:26,300
soived I all say about phloem but I've

1054
00:49:24,860 --> 00:49:27,860
actually done a lot of work on xylem too

1055
00:49:26,300 --> 00:49:30,860
and I've done a lot of work on xylem in

1056
00:49:27,860 --> 00:49:32,720
this system and it seems like what's

1057
00:49:30,860 --> 00:49:34,460
happening with leaves is more tightly

1058
00:49:32,719 --> 00:49:39,019
tied to what's happening in this eylem

1059
00:49:34,460 --> 00:49:42,559
and that the flowers are disconnected so

1060
00:49:39,019 --> 00:49:43,579
my guess is that the signaling is just

1061
00:49:42,559 --> 00:49:46,070
different and depending on the

1062
00:49:43,579 --> 00:49:48,710
conditions the flowers are more flexible

1063
00:49:46,070 --> 00:49:51,289
if the phloem is easier to reactivate

1064
00:49:48,710 --> 00:49:53,960
which is my suspicion xylem is usually

1065
00:49:51,289 --> 00:49:57,349
reactivated later a lot of species

1066
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:58,820
especially in cold climates so it might

1067
00:49:57,349 --> 00:50:01,279
be that if they're able to separate

1068
00:49:58,820 --> 00:50:03,410
themselves so to speak from the xylem

1069
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:05,390
I'd be relying on the phloem that

1070
00:50:03,409 --> 00:50:08,319
flowers are able to come out before

1071
00:50:05,389 --> 00:50:19,699
leaves but it would depend on the year

1072
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:22,130
yeah it's a great question this has been

1073
00:50:19,699 --> 00:50:26,799
a production of Cornell University on

1074
00:50:22,130 --> 00:50:26,800
the web at Cornell edu
