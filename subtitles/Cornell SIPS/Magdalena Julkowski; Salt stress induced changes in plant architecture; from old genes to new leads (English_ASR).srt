00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:05,439
this is a production of cornell

2
00:00:02,799 --> 00:00:05,439
university

3
00:00:09,759 --> 00:00:13,359
great thank you so much for uh such a

4
00:00:11,919 --> 00:00:15,039
kind introduction and giving me an

5
00:00:13,359 --> 00:00:17,198
opportunity to speak

6
00:00:15,039 --> 00:00:18,320
in front of such a wise and esteemed

7
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:20,080
audience of

8
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:21,519
plant science planned scientists of

9
00:00:20,079 --> 00:00:24,639
cornell university

10
00:00:21,519 --> 00:00:25,599
so um at my research i was lucky enough

11
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,560
to develop

12
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:29,039
my research from my phd all the way

13
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:31,198
through

14
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:32,160
my position as a as a group leader so

15
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:35,280
i'm going to take you

16
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:37,759
through that journey starting with

17
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,480
um what really amazed me as a plant

18
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:41,280
scientist

19
00:00:38,479 --> 00:00:44,558
is that plants although they have their

20
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:48,160
preferred habitats they still manage to

21
00:00:44,558 --> 00:00:49,919
to grow over over a wide range of

22
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:52,640
different habitats from

23
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,079
almost desert-like habitats where the

24
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,399
there is a high range of

25
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:58,160
daily temperatures all the way to the

26
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:00,558
tropics where the range of temperatures

27
00:00:58,159 --> 00:01:02,398
is very narrow humidity is very high

28
00:01:00,558 --> 00:01:05,679
and what's also quite interesting is

29
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:09,040
that we as a human species

30
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:11,360
manage to build agricultural systems

31
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:13,200
throughout those different habitats as

32
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:14,719
well so we've got people that are doing

33
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,359
agriculture

34
00:01:14,719 --> 00:01:20,239
in australia as crazy as it might sound

35
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:22,719
uh to europe and india and africa

36
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:24,000
so but right now as probably most of you

37
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:26,239
are aware of

38
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,519
our agricultural systems are being

39
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:29,759
challenged by the climate

40
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:31,920
climate change and in here we've got an

41
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:34,879
overview of what are the challenges to

42
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,799
the agriculture in general

43
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:38,319
and you see that a lot of those risks

44
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:40,000
are represented by blue

45
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:42,719
which is representing the water

46
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,920
availability or rather the lack of water

47
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:46,478
availability

48
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,079
so many times when there is no fresh

49
00:01:46,478 --> 00:01:49,039
water available people are doing

50
00:01:48,078 --> 00:01:51,919
irrigation

51
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:55,280
which in turns is is resulting in in

52
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:58,240
soil salinization over the long term

53
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,960
and so how can we how can we improve or

54
00:01:58,239 --> 00:02:01,118
manage that

55
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:02,319
our agricultural systems are resilient

56
00:02:01,118 --> 00:02:04,000
against those changes

57
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:06,158
so one way of doing this is to

58
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,118
domesticate species that are already

59
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:10,479
loving the extremes for example this

60
00:02:09,118 --> 00:02:13,439
desert rose which

61
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:14,400
in my photoshop fantasy i put some very

62
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:16,079
juicy fruits

63
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,560
normally the fruits of the desert rose

64
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,560
are very not very appealing to it

65
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,000
but maybe with some with some genetic

66
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,080
engineering we can domesticate

67
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,560
them and make them produce something

68
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:29,280
that we as a humans are interested in

69
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:31,039
another strategy is looking into an

70
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,120
intra-specific variation so the

71
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:35,519
variation that already exists within the

72
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,039
species we like to eat or use for other

73
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:39,039
purposes

74
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:40,959
or exploring the variation within the

75
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:44,560
species that are closely related

76
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:48,239
to the species that that we like to eat

77
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:50,080
so but before we start to equip our

78
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:52,080
agricultural systems with all of those

79
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,239
different mechanisms of resilience

80
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,400
we still need to understand what are

81
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:57,759
actually the plant responses to applying

82
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,280
those resilience mechanisms as

83
00:02:57,759 --> 00:03:02,719
efficiently as possible

84
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:05,120
with as little yield damages as

85
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:06,560
as possible as well so i'm focusing on

86
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,080
the salt stress

87
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,680
and salt is usually occurring in the

88
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,360
soil so the plants

89
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,360
when they are exposed to the salt the

90
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,319
first reaction is to try to pump all of

91
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,360
the ions

92
00:03:14,318 --> 00:03:19,759
out of the root against the gradient and

93
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:22,159
as pumping anything against the gradient

94
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:24,239
it is very energetically expensive

95
00:03:22,158 --> 00:03:25,598
and over the long term not very

96
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:29,280
efficient

97
00:03:25,598 --> 00:03:30,479
so um another part of the response is

98
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,959
whenever the salt

99
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:34,000
is accumulated in the soil in very

100
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:36,239
patches

101
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,239
and the plant will propagate its roots

102
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:40,878
mainly in the portions of the soil that

103
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:43,599
is not that much affected by salinity

104
00:03:40,878 --> 00:03:45,199
and it's known as a negative halotropism

105
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:47,839
which we described

106
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:49,439
in the crystal slab with carlos galvan

107
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,360
and puria

108
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:52,799
however at some point plant needs to

109
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:56,080
take up the water so

110
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:58,879
it takes up ions and uses them as an

111
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:00,959
osmoticum to to be able to

112
00:03:58,878 --> 00:04:02,639
increase the hydraulic conductivity into

113
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:04,959
the root and all the way so that the

114
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:07,679
plant can continue transpiring

115
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:09,039
if the salt concentration is high at

116
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,000
some point the leaves that are the

117
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:11,759
oldest

118
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,438
that have been exposed to salinity for

119
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:15,280
the longest time they are going

120
00:04:13,438 --> 00:04:18,079
undergoing a premature senescence and

121
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:20,238
the yield is probably slightly decreased

122
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:21,280
but if the concentrations of the salt in

123
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:24,399
the soil

124
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:25,599
is reaching the photosynthetic apparatus

125
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:27,120
in the younger leaves

126
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,879
they are also undergoing premature

127
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:32,000
senescence and the yolk is

128
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:35,199
basically negligible of those plants

129
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,600
so as you see the whole

130
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,800
the the this overall salinity tolerance

131
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,360
of the plant is pretty

132
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,000
complex thing it's comprised of multiple

133
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,600
processes

134
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,519
that are compounding on top of each

135
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,759
other so that's why

136
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:50,159
there is this example of the study of

137
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:50,960
qatari dao from a decade ago right now

138
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,439
where they studied

139
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:55,279
the different accessions of arabidopsis

140
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:58,639
and looked throughout time

141
00:04:55,279 --> 00:05:00,239
when watered with quite high salinity so

142
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:03,519
this is equivalent of

143
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:05,600
red sea salinity and they looked at how

144
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:06,719
those plants are surviving or not

145
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,919
surviving

146
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:11,919
throughout time and they failed to

147
00:05:09,918 --> 00:05:14,478
identify any genetic components

148
00:05:11,918 --> 00:05:15,279
because they were looking at selling

149
00:05:14,478 --> 00:05:18,319
tolerance

150
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:21,038
as a whole well

151
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:22,639
when you're trying to look at map all of

152
00:05:21,038 --> 00:05:24,159
those different processes at the same

153
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:26,240
time you simply don't have enough

154
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:28,560
statistical power to do so

155
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:30,240
so what i was told very early on in my

156
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:33,280
career is to focus

157
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:35,199
focus on specific specific tissues or

158
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:37,599
specific processes that you hypothesize

159
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:39,680
are contributing to cellulite tolerance

160
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,280
and and i might comment on that later

161
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:43,360
when when talking about high throughput

162
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:45,599
phenotyping facility

163
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:48,400
but without knowing any better i decided

164
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:52,320
to focus on root system architecture

165
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:54,638
so um when you when as a phd student i

166
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:57,120
started growing those arabidopsis plants

167
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:58,000
on increasing concentrations of soil if

168
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,240
salt

169
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,399
i observe that yeah plants the more salt

170
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,560
you add the smaller they grow

171
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:06,638
not very surprising but the question

172
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,280
that i really really was excited about

173
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:10,400
addressing

174
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:10,959
is is it on is the salt or stress in

175
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:13,758
general

176
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:15,680
only delaying plant development or is it

177
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:18,080
really reprogramming it

178
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:19,120
so i scratch my hair my my head for a

179
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:20,800
couple of minutes to

180
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,319
to figure out how are we going to do

181
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,960
that

182
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:26,240
um and i decided to to to look at the

183
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:29,120
dynamics of

184
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:31,360
root development throughout time and

185
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:33,840
under different soul stress conditions

186
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:35,199
so um what we basically did is we

187
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:37,918
germinated the plants

188
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:39,360
under um control conditions for four

189
00:06:37,918 --> 00:06:41,519
days and at four they all

190
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:43,840
the the root there's just the main roots

191
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:46,159
there's not much architecture per se

192
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:47,839
to a plant so at four day we

193
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:51,599
transplanted those seedlings

194
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:53,119
into zero 75 and 125 millimolar of salt

195
00:06:51,598 --> 00:06:56,399
stress

196
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:58,478
and we scan those plates

197
00:06:56,399 --> 00:06:59,918
very high-tech technology scanning off

198
00:06:58,478 --> 00:07:03,038
the plates every second

199
00:06:59,918 --> 00:07:03,680
day and to observe how the plants are

200
00:07:03,038 --> 00:07:05,439
developing

201
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,759
under those different conditions and

202
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:11,038
then later on we also quantified

203
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:12,879
um this development using a semi

204
00:07:11,038 --> 00:07:16,000
automatic or semi-manual

205
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:19,038
uh software called easy rhizo

206
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,360
so once we had the heaps of data and i

207
00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:22,879
had to think about how to synthesize it

208
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:25,759
in a way that i can really make

209
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:28,000
comparisons so what i did is i set up a

210
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:29,520
very simple model to describe

211
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,759
the growth of the root system

212
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:33,279
architecture per se so i divided it into

213
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:33,919
three components so we're starting with

214
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:35,918
this

215
00:07:33,918 --> 00:07:37,758
main root that is just a tiny little

216
00:07:35,918 --> 00:07:40,000
root at the four days

217
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:42,080
and that root is growing with a certain

218
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,439
speed and i could fit a quadratic

219
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:45,758
function into that

220
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:46,800
sorry so you've got the starting

221
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:49,199
starting point

222
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,240
and then you've got the growth rate of

223
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:51,680
the of the root

224
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:54,079
at some point you also have lateral

225
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:56,240
roots popping up and the speed at which

226
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:58,000
the lateral roots are emerging

227
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,840
is also the increase of the lateral root

228
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,079
number so we can also fit

229
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:03,918
similar type of function in there and

230
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:05,519
then you also have the outgrowth of

231
00:08:03,918 --> 00:08:06,799
those lateral roots which you can then

232
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:09,680
measure with

233
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,960
like fit an average latitude length

234
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,800
speed to it

235
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:14,719
so basically you can summarize the

236
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,478
entire dynamic

237
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,759
of the root system architecture in just

238
00:08:16,478 --> 00:08:20,000
three numbers

239
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:20,879
and by adding and multiplying them

240
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,038
together we could

241
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:24,639
definitely predict the total root size

242
00:08:23,038 --> 00:08:26,399
of the entire root system which was

243
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:28,960
really really cool

244
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:30,079
so when i quantified those all of those

245
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:32,399
different parameters

246
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:33,278
in the three different conditions for

247
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:35,200
the main roots

248
00:08:33,278 --> 00:08:36,719
number of lateral roots and average

249
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:39,519
lateral root growth

250
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:41,519
and what i observe is that you've got

251
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:44,240
the decrease the more salt you add the

252
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:47,360
slower individual components are growing

253
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:48,639
again not very surprising but because

254
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,959
we're using the same

255
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:53,120
kind of family of mathematical formulas

256
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:55,278
so this is a quadratic formula

257
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:57,600
and we can actually compare the

258
00:08:55,278 --> 00:08:59,519
differences caused by salt between

259
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,600
individual components so when we

260
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:03,278
calculate the relative

261
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,519
change in the main root number of

262
00:09:03,278 --> 00:09:08,799
lateral roots and every flat root

263
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:10,480
growth between those components we

264
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:12,559
observed that in colombia which is a

265
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:14,240
reference genotype of arabidopsis

266
00:09:12,559 --> 00:09:15,919
the main root is impacted much more

267
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:17,440
severely than the number of lateral

268
00:09:15,919 --> 00:09:19,120
roots and average lateral root lengths

269
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:21,360
in both conditions

270
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:22,560
which was pretty pretty exciting because

271
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,720
it means that

272
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:26,000
they are not only growing just slower

273
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,480
they are really growing

274
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,559
differently because if they would be

275
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:33,440
impacted with exactly the same

276
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:35,359
um extent then we wouldn't see any of

277
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:38,399
the differences in the relative

278
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:41,759
change right okay so then

279
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:43,759
we quantified multiple accessions so we

280
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:45,120
classified them uh some of them that

281
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:48,000
were responsible

282
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:49,759
responding exactly the same as colombia

283
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,200
some of them were having exactly the

284
00:09:49,759 --> 00:09:52,559
opposite so the main root kept on

285
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:56,080
growing but the lateral roots

286
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:59,199
not so much so um we also

287
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:00,879
performed um quantification of the root

288
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:03,680
system architecture on a wider

289
00:10:00,879 --> 00:10:07,039
population which comprised

290
00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:08,879
accessions and for this this population

291
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:11,599
back then when i was starting a phd we

292
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:12,559
had a data set of 250 000 snips

293
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,320
available

294
00:10:12,559 --> 00:10:16,000
which allowed us to do a genomic

295
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:17,760
association study

296
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,120
and so connecting our different

297
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:21,039
phenotypes of the root system

298
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,879
architecture with the snip markers so

299
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:25,120
here you see a typical output of the

300
00:10:22,879 --> 00:10:27,278
genome association and manhattan plot

301
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:29,278
association strength on the y-axis and

302
00:10:27,278 --> 00:10:31,200
five chromosomes of arabidopsis

303
00:10:29,278 --> 00:10:33,120
and here is an association that we were

304
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:36,160
most excited and the association was

305
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:39,759
with average latitude length

306
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:41,600
um and why were why were we the most

307
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:43,439
excited about this association is

308
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:46,159
basically because it was

309
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:48,560
association with hkt1 which stands for

310
00:10:46,159 --> 00:10:51,919
high affinity potassium transporter

311
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:55,278
so that's the beauty of salt stress

312
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:57,360
field so in multiple plant species there

313
00:10:55,278 --> 00:10:59,439
are number of hkt1 in arabidopsis

314
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:01,278
there's only one hkt1

315
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:03,040
and it's not transporting potassium but

316
00:11:01,278 --> 00:11:05,600
it's made from transporting sodium

317
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:07,679
into the cell and we were very excited

318
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,560
because hkt1 was already previously

319
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:12,399
mapped by

320
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:14,879
avon baxter and to be associated with

321
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:16,559
sodium accumulation trade that we know

322
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:18,480
was very much correlated with selling

323
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:21,039
its tolerance but it was not previously

324
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:24,399
associated with root development

325
00:11:21,039 --> 00:11:25,039
so we made use of the lines that were

326
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:28,159
available

327
00:11:25,039 --> 00:11:30,719
for those hkt1 which um

328
00:11:28,159 --> 00:11:33,278
where over expression lines in the xylem

329
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:37,040
popery cycle which is a native

330
00:11:33,278 --> 00:11:37,679
expression site for hkt1 so why is hkt1

331
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:39,919
correct

332
00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:42,159
correlated with salinity tolerance when

333
00:11:39,919 --> 00:11:44,719
it's actually pumping ions in

334
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:47,199
um so it's the key is where is the

335
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:49,360
native expression of the hkt1 so it's

336
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:51,120
expressed in the xylem propery cycles

337
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,480
which are the cells that are surrounding

338
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,078
the transpiration stream

339
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:56,240
and are basically sucking all of the

340
00:11:54,078 --> 00:11:58,239
ions out of the transpiration stream

341
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:00,480
so that that that sodium is not

342
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:03,120
accumulating to the toxic levels

343
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:04,399
into the into the chute so when we

344
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,399
looked at those lines and

345
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:08,000
the ingo miller generated those lines in

346
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:09,600
both columbia and c24

347
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,440
background so here we've got the

348
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,360
background lines and the two

349
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,560
lines that have an over expression of

350
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,759
hkt1

351
00:12:14,559 --> 00:12:17,278
when we grew them under control

352
00:12:15,759 --> 00:12:19,600
conditions there is not much difference

353
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:22,159
but as soon as we added salt

354
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:23,600
we observed that there is a the the

355
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:24,000
plants are really suffering and they're

356
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,240
mainly

357
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,120
suffering in their lateral development

358
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:30,560
as you can see

359
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:31,440
demonstrated in here well no significant

360
00:12:30,559 --> 00:12:33,518
differences were

361
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:35,440
observed under control conditions so

362
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:38,560
that was exciting but then we had to

363
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:41,040
think like how is that possible so

364
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:43,199
hkt1 as i already told you is expressed

365
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:45,120
around xylem for parasites

366
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:47,278
around excellent vessels and that's

367
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:49,200
exactly the same tissue that is giving

368
00:12:47,278 --> 00:12:52,879
origin to the lateral roots

369
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:55,440
so if you over accumulate those ions

370
00:12:52,879 --> 00:12:56,799
in this very tiny precious little

371
00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:00,320
lateral root primordia

372
00:12:56,799 --> 00:13:02,159
they're going to die so we thought okay

373
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,720
this is a good hypothesis let's test it

374
00:13:02,159 --> 00:13:05,199
in another

375
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:06,000
biological system so there are lines

376
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:09,120
wheat lines so

377
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:12,559
wheat has five hkt1

378
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:15,360
genes and uh to be to make it easier

379
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:18,399
hkt1 that is the most homologous to

380
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:20,560
arabidopsis one is nax2 locus

381
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:21,519
and in here we've got the introgression

382
00:13:20,559 --> 00:13:24,719
lines of

383
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:26,560
another hkt1 and an hkt1 that is

384
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,600
homologous to arabidopsis so this is the

385
00:13:26,559 --> 00:13:29,278
nax2

386
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,839
and we got those those lines from

387
00:13:29,278 --> 00:13:32,799
ranamans and richard james from csiro in

388
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:35,760
australia

389
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:37,439
and we screened them very early on in

390
00:13:35,759 --> 00:13:40,720
their development for changes

391
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:42,480
in the interseminal root length lateral

392
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:44,720
lateral root number and lateral root

393
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,360
length under control conditions and salt

394
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:47,519
stress

395
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:49,519
so for the seminal root length we didn't

396
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:52,000
really observe that much of a difference

397
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:53,600
either in control or insult stress but

398
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,919
when it came to number of

399
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,639
lateral roots or average lateral root

400
00:13:55,919 --> 00:13:58,639
lengths

401
00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:00,799
we saw a little bit of a phenotype under

402
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:02,799
control conditions but it was definitely

403
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:05,519
much more pronounced under soul stress

404
00:14:02,799 --> 00:14:06,719
that those lines with high hkt1

405
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:08,799
expression in the weed

406
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:10,560
developed more lateral roots which is

407
00:14:08,799 --> 00:14:12,799
exactly the right phenotype in exactly

408
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:14,958
the wrong direction

409
00:14:12,799 --> 00:14:17,519
so we were again scratching back to the

410
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:20,719
drawing board scratching our heads

411
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:22,799
how is that possible and reviewing some

412
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:24,480
basic developmental biology and

413
00:14:22,799 --> 00:14:25,278
differences between the monocots and

414
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:27,839
dicots

415
00:14:25,278 --> 00:14:28,399
well hkt1 in wheat is still expressed

416
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:32,079
around

417
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:33,360
the asylum and the lateral roots are

418
00:14:32,078 --> 00:14:35,278
actually originating from the

419
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:38,720
phloemperic cycle

420
00:14:35,278 --> 00:14:41,198
so hkt1 is giving much better um

421
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:42,959
protection for the in the in the wheat

422
00:14:41,198 --> 00:14:44,799
without damaging the lateral

423
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:46,879
development unlike in the in the

424
00:14:44,799 --> 00:14:48,719
arabidopsis so this is at the moment

425
00:14:46,879 --> 00:14:50,240
the working hypothesis that we're

426
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,079
dealing with

427
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:53,278
another interesting phenomenon that we

428
00:14:52,078 --> 00:14:55,759
observe is

429
00:14:53,278 --> 00:14:57,439
that when we supplement it so hkt1 is

430
00:14:55,759 --> 00:14:59,360
mainly transporting

431
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:01,519
sodium but it also transports a little

432
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:03,360
bit potassium and salt stress is not

433
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:05,278
only about iron accumulation but also

434
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,720
getting a disbalance between sodium and

435
00:15:05,278 --> 00:15:08,559
potassium

436
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,399
so we were wondering if we add a little

437
00:15:08,559 --> 00:15:10,958
bit of potassium to the media together

438
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:14,078
with our

439
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:16,799
souls can we then alleviate this

440
00:15:14,078 --> 00:15:17,919
this um dramatic decrease in lateral

441
00:15:16,799 --> 00:15:20,240
root development

442
00:15:17,919 --> 00:15:22,000
and the answer is yes we can although in

443
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:23,759
the background lines the number the

444
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,240
average lateral root length went down

445
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:27,360
because

446
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:30,799
you've got higher overall osmolarity

447
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:33,278
and we we could we could observe a very

448
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:35,519
small but still significant the increase

449
00:15:33,278 --> 00:15:37,519
in the lateral development in the in the

450
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:40,078
lines over expressing hkt1

451
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:41,120
so we thought okay let's use hkt1 as a

452
00:15:40,078 --> 00:15:42,719
tool to learn

453
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:44,240
more about what's happening to the

454
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:47,040
lateral development

455
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:47,680
undersold stress and so we did what many

456
00:15:47,039 --> 00:15:50,879
people do

457
00:15:47,679 --> 00:15:53,039
when they want to move forward and and

458
00:15:50,879 --> 00:15:54,320
do a hypothesis generating experiment we

459
00:15:53,039 --> 00:15:56,958
did aaron asec

460
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:58,800
where we again gener germinated those

461
00:15:56,958 --> 00:16:00,879
seedlings on the control conditions we

462
00:15:58,799 --> 00:16:03,359
transferred them to four different

463
00:16:00,879 --> 00:16:05,919
treatments we let the seedling be there

464
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:06,560
for 24 hours and then we harvested only

465
00:16:05,919 --> 00:16:08,399
the root

466
00:16:06,559 --> 00:16:09,919
from all four genome types per

467
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:12,799
experiment so

468
00:16:09,919 --> 00:16:14,159
one sample consisted of 150 to 200

469
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:16,559
seedlings so you can imagine i was

470
00:16:14,159 --> 00:16:18,240
harvesting forests of arabidopsis

471
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:21,119
we had three replicates per line per

472
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:23,120
condition and we only harvested roots so

473
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,799
after doing oops

474
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:26,720
sorry not the right direction so after

475
00:16:24,799 --> 00:16:29,359
doing differential expression

476
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:30,800
for individual line between control and

477
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:33,440
individual treatments we

478
00:16:30,799 --> 00:16:34,399
also did a double differential

479
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:37,199
expression

480
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:39,360
between the background line and the line

481
00:16:37,198 --> 00:16:40,958
over expressing hkt1 so we've got a

482
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:43,440
response not only to stress

483
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:44,559
but also to hkt1 which is background

484
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:46,639
specific

485
00:16:44,559 --> 00:16:48,958
so after we did that so here we see

486
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:51,919
differential expression in response to

487
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:53,359
salt and hkt1 and c24 background

488
00:16:51,919 --> 00:16:55,278
and here we've got the same for the

489
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:58,240
columbia background and here we've got

490
00:16:55,278 --> 00:17:00,159
salt and potassium for c24 salt and

491
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:02,639
potassium for colombia

492
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:04,000
and when we looked at the overlapping

493
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:06,880
genes surprisingly enough

494
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,160
we didn't find that many genes that were

495
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,880
overlapping between two different

496
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,400
backgrounds

497
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,919
but we also know that those two

498
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:14,160
different lines are having very

499
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:16,480
fundamentally different responses

500
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:17,600
to stress so we were in the end we were

501
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:20,160
happy to have

502
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:22,078
any overlap i would say and when you

503
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:24,558
have little overlap it's easier to pick

504
00:17:22,078 --> 00:17:27,119
the genes that you're going to focus on

505
00:17:24,558 --> 00:17:27,599
so one of the genes that we focused on

506
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:31,038
was

507
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:31,359
shared between colombia and c24 response

508
00:17:31,038 --> 00:17:35,038
to

509
00:17:31,359 --> 00:17:37,359
salt nhkh1 and it was encoding tmac2

510
00:17:35,038 --> 00:17:39,279
which is a negative aba regulator

511
00:17:37,359 --> 00:17:41,519
and when we looked at the relative

512
00:17:39,279 --> 00:17:44,319
expression of this tmac2

513
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:46,480
in the columbia an over expression line

514
00:17:44,319 --> 00:17:48,000
in c24 and it's over expression line we

515
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:49,679
observed that the pattern was actually

516
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,839
yeah it was significantly changed but it

517
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:55,120
was exactly the opposite

518
00:17:51,839 --> 00:17:56,480
which was very very interesting so uh we

519
00:17:55,119 --> 00:17:59,599
couldn't get our hands on

520
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:00,400
any of the mutants of the tmac but we

521
00:17:59,599 --> 00:18:03,439
did measure

522
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:06,559
aba accumulation in collaboration with

523
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:11,038
sorry in collaboration with jang yuvang

524
00:18:06,558 --> 00:18:13,678
from salim albabili lab in kaust and

525
00:18:11,038 --> 00:18:15,919
what we did what we observed is the

526
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:18,880
pattern that was exactly complementary

527
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:20,559
to an expression of negative aba

528
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:22,960
regulators so whenever our

529
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:24,639
negative aba regulator was upregulated

530
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:26,880
the aba levels were down

531
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:28,000
whenever it was downregulated the aba

532
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:30,799
levels were

533
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,160
up so there might be some some feedback

534
00:18:30,798 --> 00:18:34,720
mechanisms between this

535
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:36,640
aba negative regulator and the aba

536
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:38,558
biosynthesis itself

537
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:40,320
which i think is quite interesting so at

538
00:18:38,558 --> 00:18:41,599
the moment we're generating the crispr

539
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:45,359
mutants

540
00:18:41,599 --> 00:18:48,480
in in all of those background of

541
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:50,240
c24 colombia and both tissue-specific

542
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:52,880
over-expression lines to see

543
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:54,480
do we have uh can we reverse this

544
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:57,760
decrease in latitude

545
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:59,679
emergence and result stress another gene

546
00:18:57,759 --> 00:19:02,240
that we also explored was

547
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:03,759
tip 2-2 which encodes a tonoplast

548
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:06,798
interesting protein

549
00:19:03,759 --> 00:19:07,519
um which is supposedly an aquaporin

550
00:19:06,798 --> 00:19:09,359
although

551
00:19:07,519 --> 00:19:10,960
nowadays there there is an increasing

552
00:19:09,359 --> 00:19:13,519
evidence that aquaporins are

553
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:15,600
transporting much more than just water

554
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:16,558
so over here we observe that in both

555
00:19:15,599 --> 00:19:19,678
lines

556
00:19:16,558 --> 00:19:23,279
of over expression the upright the tip

557
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:26,240
2-2 expression was upregulated

558
00:19:23,279 --> 00:19:28,079
and luckily we could get our hands on

559
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:30,640
tip 2-2 mutant

560
00:19:28,079 --> 00:19:32,558
in colombia background and we explored

561
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,200
their root system architecture under

562
00:19:32,558 --> 00:19:35,038
control

563
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,960
salt and more salt conditions for total

564
00:19:35,038 --> 00:19:38,240
root length number of lateral roots and

565
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:40,079
main root lengths

566
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:41,759
and we didn't see that much of a

567
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:43,359
difference under control conditions but

568
00:19:41,759 --> 00:19:45,038
as soon as we added salt

569
00:19:43,359 --> 00:19:47,119
the difference in the total root length

570
00:19:45,038 --> 00:19:48,720
was becoming more and more pronounced

571
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:51,918
and we figured out that it's mainly

572
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:53,759
because the tip-2-2 mutants developed

573
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:56,480
much more number of latitudes

574
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:58,640
so again right now we're generating the

575
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:00,160
crispr mutants in the background of the

576
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:03,038
uas hkt1

577
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:03,919
lines and their retrospective background

578
00:20:03,038 --> 00:20:06,000
lines

579
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:07,200
and also we're working in collaboration

580
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,400
with steve tireman

581
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:12,558
and and caitlin bird in australia with

582
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:14,640
um the transport properties of this tip

583
00:20:12,558 --> 00:20:17,119
2-2 because it hasn't been that well

584
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:20,159
characterized yet

585
00:20:17,119 --> 00:20:21,599
so this was all focusing on the root

586
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:23,440
system architecture and as a root

587
00:20:21,599 --> 00:20:23,839
biologist i tend to be very proud

588
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:26,159
because

589
00:20:23,839 --> 00:20:27,439
i'm working on the on the hidden part of

590
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:29,760
the of the part

591
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:30,798
of the hidden half of the plant but it's

592
00:20:29,759 --> 00:20:32,960
still a half

593
00:20:30,798 --> 00:20:34,158
so talking to mark we realized that we

594
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:35,919
don't really know what's happening to

595
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:37,840
the root to shoot ratio

596
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:39,520
in salt stress unlike we know what's

597
00:20:37,839 --> 00:20:42,558
happening in the drought

598
00:20:39,519 --> 00:20:43,599
so together with first rashid we

599
00:20:42,558 --> 00:20:46,000
developed this

600
00:20:43,599 --> 00:20:47,279
tool that was able to transfer our

601
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,079
scanned pictures

602
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:51,839
into just green white and blue pixels

603
00:20:50,079 --> 00:20:54,079
and it's a semi-manual

604
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:56,319
analysis tool so i only say it's

605
00:20:54,079 --> 00:20:57,759
semi-manual because if you as a phd

606
00:20:56,319 --> 00:21:00,558
student in postdoc

607
00:20:57,759 --> 00:21:02,319
get to work with semi-automatic making

608
00:21:00,558 --> 00:21:03,839
all of those manual corrections you

609
00:21:02,319 --> 00:21:07,359
realize that it's quite still

610
00:21:03,839 --> 00:21:09,599
a lot of manual work um but

611
00:21:07,359 --> 00:21:11,359
we still did it it wasn't perfect

612
00:21:09,599 --> 00:21:13,038
because we were still not able to deal

613
00:21:11,359 --> 00:21:14,319
with plans that where the roots are

614
00:21:13,038 --> 00:21:15,919
overlapping

615
00:21:14,319 --> 00:21:17,918
so there might be still a little bit of

616
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:18,640
an error but we were willing to take

617
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:21,200
that risk

618
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:22,960
of that error and use the tool to

619
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:26,080
calculate the growth rate

620
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:27,038
of the root and the shoot and here again

621
00:21:26,079 --> 00:21:28,960
we fitted

622
00:21:27,038 --> 00:21:31,119
very simple mathematical functions and

623
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:33,200
here we're using exponential functions

624
00:21:31,119 --> 00:21:34,319
to estimate the root growth and the

625
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:37,600
shoot growth

626
00:21:34,319 --> 00:21:38,480
of the all 350 accessions of arabidopsis

627
00:21:37,599 --> 00:21:41,119
again

628
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:42,798
and again the more stress you add the

629
00:21:41,119 --> 00:21:45,519
slower the plants are growing

630
00:21:42,798 --> 00:21:47,200
but the more interestingly is that when

631
00:21:45,519 --> 00:21:50,960
you look at the route to shoot

632
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:52,960
growth rate ratio oops right

633
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:55,360
and you see that it's not really

634
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:56,240
responding in a certain way so the

635
00:21:55,359 --> 00:21:58,000
plants are not getting

636
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:59,679
rootier as they would under drought

637
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,240
stress but actually they are just

638
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:04,159
getting dysregulated so the roots and

639
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:05,759
the shoot growth rate is not as well

640
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:06,640
coordinated as it is under control

641
00:22:05,759 --> 00:22:10,240
conditions

642
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:13,440
but it's just going both ways

643
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:15,759
so we did genomic dissociation

644
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:16,798
and we used shoot per total seedling

645
00:22:15,759 --> 00:22:18,558
area as

646
00:22:16,798 --> 00:22:19,839
our indicator of root to shoot ratio

647
00:22:18,558 --> 00:22:22,079
among other things

648
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:23,678
and one of the associations we found was

649
00:22:22,079 --> 00:22:27,279
on chromosome 3

650
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:28,880
and this association was in the duf 247

651
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:31,000
which if you don't know stands for

652
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:34,400
domain of unknown function

653
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:37,519
247 so so far for creative

654
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:38,080
naming anyway so it was in the in the

655
00:22:37,519 --> 00:22:41,440
valley

656
00:22:38,079 --> 00:22:43,678
of other duf 247 and

657
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:44,480
we looked at the sequence diversity

658
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:46,720
across

659
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:48,640
hapmap accessions we observed that there

660
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:49,839
are some insertions and deletions and

661
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:53,038
that there is some sequence

662
00:22:49,839 --> 00:22:53,599
divergence in here and when we use the

663
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:55,599
newer

664
00:22:53,599 --> 00:22:58,000
snip set containing 10 million snips

665
00:22:55,599 --> 00:23:00,719
that was provided to us by arthur corta

666
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,440
well the threshold went up but we found

667
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,759
much more

668
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:06,240
snips that were still above our previous

669
00:23:03,759 --> 00:23:08,879
threshold of six

670
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:09,599
so we found around 50 associations 50

671
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:13,200
snips

672
00:23:09,599 --> 00:23:15,678
within this duf-247 so

673
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:17,600
what we also did is we looked at all of

674
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:19,759
the snips that were in the coding region

675
00:23:17,599 --> 00:23:21,199
of the duf-247 and performed haplotype

676
00:23:19,759 --> 00:23:22,960
analysis so we grouped

677
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:25,440
now the accession is not per snip but

678
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:29,038
just per the clusters of snips

679
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:31,679
and we found that cluster 11 um

680
00:23:29,038 --> 00:23:33,679
was significantly shootier than the

681
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:34,320
cluster one which contained our favorite

682
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:37,600
columbia

683
00:23:34,319 --> 00:23:39,599
zero so when we started to clone

684
00:23:37,599 --> 00:23:40,879
those different alleles together with

685
00:23:39,599 --> 00:23:43,759
michelle sorry

686
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:44,159
michelle alcatani who was a phd student

687
00:23:43,759 --> 00:23:46,640
in

688
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:47,278
mark's lab and we observed that there

689
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:51,120
are actually

690
00:23:47,278 --> 00:23:53,119
two huge 200 base purse insertions

691
00:23:51,119 --> 00:23:55,199
in here and they are leading to a

692
00:23:53,119 --> 00:23:59,839
premature stop codon which is basically

693
00:23:55,200 --> 00:24:02,880
resulting in lack of the duf domain

694
00:23:59,839 --> 00:24:06,158
so um we also know

695
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:07,760
that there are 26 other duf 247 in

696
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:11,200
arabic genomes

697
00:24:07,759 --> 00:24:12,480
the closest similarity are the dufs 247

698
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:14,480
that are within

699
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:16,240
within the same genomic region but they

700
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:18,880
are showing very little expression

701
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:19,759
similarity so right now in the lab at

702
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:21,520
the bti

703
00:24:19,759 --> 00:24:23,519
haley sussman is working on the

704
00:24:21,519 --> 00:24:25,599
functional characterization of the

705
00:24:23,519 --> 00:24:27,278
different tdna insertion mutants of

706
00:24:25,599 --> 00:24:29,439
not only the daf that we're interested

707
00:24:27,278 --> 00:24:32,640
in but also all of the other ones that

708
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:33,440
are in the neighboring um regions and

709
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:36,240
also

710
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:38,000
figuring out where is this duf 247

711
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:40,400
localizing to

712
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:42,400
liang is looking at the evolutionary

713
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:44,240
context of the duf 247

714
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:45,440
in collaboration of course with andrew

715
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:49,038
nelson

716
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:51,440
and anna nelson is

717
00:24:49,038 --> 00:24:53,759
doing molecular characterization of the

718
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:55,200
duf-247 looking at calcium binding

719
00:24:53,759 --> 00:24:57,759
dimerization

720
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,960
and also at those characteristics of the

721
00:24:57,759 --> 00:25:01,759
domains

722
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:03,600
so now for the whatever time i've got

723
00:25:01,759 --> 00:25:04,798
remaining i want to kind of switch gears

724
00:25:03,599 --> 00:25:06,399
and talk about

725
00:25:04,798 --> 00:25:08,720
like do we really need to focus on

726
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:11,120
individual traits so traditionally

727
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:12,720
as a biologist we learn to use forward

728
00:25:11,119 --> 00:25:15,519
or reverse genetics

729
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:18,000
and to identify the cor the relationship

730
00:25:15,519 --> 00:25:21,038
between a gene and a phenotype

731
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,159
or a phenotype and an allelic variation

732
00:25:21,038 --> 00:25:25,599
within the gene

733
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:27,520
in in terms of forward genetics

734
00:25:25,599 --> 00:25:29,359
and those there's absolutely nothing

735
00:25:27,519 --> 00:25:29,918
wrong with that and we learned a lot we

736
00:25:29,359 --> 00:25:32,879
learned

737
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:34,159
which processes are are important for

738
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:36,480
celine tolerance

739
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:38,159
which genes are among other genes

740
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:40,480
contributing to that

741
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:42,000
and how are all of those different genes

742
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:44,558
uh interacting

743
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,000
but what we're what we're still missing

744
00:25:44,558 --> 00:25:47,839
from one picture

745
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,079
is all of the other traits that could

746
00:25:47,839 --> 00:25:52,319
potentially contribute that we are not

747
00:25:50,079 --> 00:25:54,480
even hypothesizing or contributing

748
00:25:52,319 --> 00:25:56,240
so this is i think where high throughput

749
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:58,798
phenotyping is coming in

750
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:59,359
and high throughput enabled discovery

751
00:25:58,798 --> 00:26:02,400
because

752
00:25:59,359 --> 00:26:03,038
where then you can think about you can

753
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:06,159
think about

754
00:26:03,038 --> 00:26:07,839
your in in the interesting process that

755
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:10,480
that is of your interest

756
00:26:07,839 --> 00:26:13,038
and without the need to focus on only

757
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:16,240
one phenotype that you can score

758
00:26:13,038 --> 00:26:18,720
um so you can score multiple fiends

759
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:20,880
so those are basically a relation to a

760
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:23,440
fee into a phenotype is the same as

761
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:24,400
gene to a genotype so it's very

762
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:27,038
elemental

763
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:28,480
function of the phenotype uh you can

764
00:26:27,038 --> 00:26:31,519
score them throughout time

765
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:33,440
and and the the denser you go you can

766
00:26:31,519 --> 00:26:35,278
also observe very transient processes

767
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:37,200
which are still occurring but we're very

768
00:26:35,278 --> 00:26:38,720
often missing when we're doing it in the

769
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:42,960
field or when we're doing

770
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:45,759
doing phenotyping um that is destructive

771
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:47,440
so we can not only quantify how the

772
00:26:45,759 --> 00:26:48,319
fiend contributes to overall plant

773
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:50,240
performance

774
00:26:48,319 --> 00:26:52,000
but also what is the individual

775
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:53,679
contribution of the fiend to each other

776
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,519
and how they are reacting and how those

777
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:56,240
interactions are changing throughout

778
00:26:55,519 --> 00:27:00,240
time

779
00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:03,679
and throughout um different conditions

780
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:04,480
so um i've got some uh papers that are

781
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:07,278
already that

782
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:08,960
where we're looking into how can we use

783
00:27:07,278 --> 00:27:11,839
high throughput phenotyping

784
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:14,079
into gaining more insight gaining more

785
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:16,240
insight about the process in general

786
00:27:14,079 --> 00:27:17,119
looking beyond one phenotype and beyond

787
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:19,038
one gene

788
00:27:17,119 --> 00:27:21,119
so one example is this paper that was

789
00:27:19,038 --> 00:27:23,038
published with gigi gao

790
00:27:21,119 --> 00:27:24,158
in plant phenomics where we basically

791
00:27:23,038 --> 00:27:26,079
took colombia

792
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:28,399
and a mutant that we know is heat

793
00:27:26,079 --> 00:27:30,398
sensitive and we

794
00:27:28,398 --> 00:27:31,839
phenotyped it in the with the high

795
00:27:30,398 --> 00:27:34,798
throughput facility

796
00:27:31,839 --> 00:27:35,439
and we developed a logistic regression

797
00:27:34,798 --> 00:27:38,079
model

798
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:38,880
where we trained it on the subset of our

799
00:27:38,079 --> 00:27:42,158
data

800
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:43,840
and um and then the the model was able

801
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:46,240
to distinguish whether a plant was a

802
00:27:43,839 --> 00:27:47,678
mutant or a wild type based only on the

803
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:49,120
inputted phenotypes

804
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:51,120
and then we could retest it on the

805
00:27:49,119 --> 00:27:53,599
remaining set of the data

806
00:27:51,119 --> 00:27:55,839
and and usually machine learning is

807
00:27:53,599 --> 00:27:58,480
being seen as this black box

808
00:27:55,839 --> 00:28:00,240
but i'm really interested to look what's

809
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:01,679
inside and making that black box

810
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:04,079
transparent to see

811
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:06,159
which of the traits are actually used by

812
00:28:04,079 --> 00:28:08,480
this logistic regression

813
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:10,799
with more seriousness are being taken

814
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:13,278
more seriously into consideration

815
00:28:10,798 --> 00:28:15,200
how to make a decision and like this we

816
00:28:13,278 --> 00:28:16,960
can also learn which of the traits are

817
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:19,200
contributing

818
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:20,079
to this distinction between mutant or

819
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:22,480
wild type

820
00:28:20,079 --> 00:28:24,000
or stress and non-stress plans and

821
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:26,558
things like that and i think that

822
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:29,038
one of the this might be a powerful

823
00:28:26,558 --> 00:28:31,200
approach later on

824
00:28:29,038 --> 00:28:32,798
another paper that is currently under

825
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,440
revision but you can find the bio

826
00:28:32,798 --> 00:28:36,079
archive

827
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:38,320
version of it is um a paper that we

828
00:28:36,079 --> 00:28:40,398
worked together with maryam aulia

829
00:28:38,319 --> 00:28:42,639
who focused on early responses to salt

830
00:28:40,398 --> 00:28:44,639
stress so she developed a protocol to

831
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:46,720
apply salt stress in the soil

832
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:48,399
and then phenotype the plants for the

833
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:51,519
subsequent seven days

834
00:28:48,398 --> 00:28:53,599
so we end up with this big data tsunami

835
00:28:51,519 --> 00:28:55,278
which we then used for multivariate

836
00:28:53,599 --> 00:28:56,639
analysis and machine learning and in

837
00:28:55,278 --> 00:28:58,240
this case we didn't use logistic

838
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:01,278
regressions but we used

839
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:04,079
tree based models and

840
00:29:01,278 --> 00:29:06,159
and that's allowed us to identify the

841
00:29:04,079 --> 00:29:07,678
traits that have a high contribution to

842
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:10,000
overall plant size

843
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:10,798
under control and soil stress conditions

844
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,798
and also

845
00:29:10,798 --> 00:29:15,200
took that information when we were

846
00:29:12,798 --> 00:29:16,158
reviewing the genomic association output

847
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,679
so we knew

848
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:20,320
which of the traits we should give a

849
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:23,038
little bit more love to and attention

850
00:29:20,319 --> 00:29:25,359
and so that led us to identification of

851
00:29:23,038 --> 00:29:28,480
this uncharacterized protein kinase

852
00:29:25,359 --> 00:29:30,398
which affects um quantum yield under

853
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:34,319
light adapted conditions

854
00:29:30,398 --> 00:29:35,038
and and then also the mutants show the

855
00:29:34,319 --> 00:29:40,720
significant

856
00:29:35,038 --> 00:29:43,599
differences um with their um

857
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:43,919
with the uh with colombia for the for

858
00:29:43,599 --> 00:29:46,319
just

859
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:48,159
overall plant area and plant growth

860
00:29:46,319 --> 00:29:50,079
which i think is pretty excited and i

861
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:52,320
don't think we would have focused on

862
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:53,359
one of the 700 associations that we

863
00:29:52,319 --> 00:29:56,798
found

864
00:29:53,359 --> 00:29:58,479
without doing this step all right um

865
00:29:56,798 --> 00:30:00,398
i don't really have that much time to

866
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:02,480
talk about that but i also was involved

867
00:30:00,398 --> 00:30:05,439
in developing multiple tools for

868
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:05,759
dealing with high amount of data so mv

869
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:08,320
app

870
00:30:05,759 --> 00:30:09,200
is one of the results where it allows

871
00:30:08,319 --> 00:30:11,038
you to do

872
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:12,640
quick pre-processing of your data

873
00:30:11,038 --> 00:30:15,839
identify outliers which

874
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:17,759
usually takes quite a lot of time and

875
00:30:15,839 --> 00:30:19,439
but also evaluate the traits for the

876
00:30:17,759 --> 00:30:21,038
broad sense heritability

877
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:22,640
do some curve fittings so you can

878
00:30:21,038 --> 00:30:23,599
estimate the growth rate summary

879
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:25,840
statistics

880
00:30:23,599 --> 00:30:27,359
but also hypothesis testing so we

881
00:30:25,839 --> 00:30:29,439
usually do anova but nobody

882
00:30:27,359 --> 00:30:31,038
really does assumptions testing

883
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:33,519
assumptions for anova so

884
00:30:31,038 --> 00:30:35,359
it's there you don't have any excuse now

885
00:30:33,519 --> 00:30:36,079
and but also a lot of hypothesis

886
00:30:35,359 --> 00:30:38,719
generating

887
00:30:36,079 --> 00:30:41,519
uh tools which is quantum regression

888
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:44,319
clustering correlation analysis pca

889
00:30:41,519 --> 00:30:46,079
so all of this is based on r but we just

890
00:30:44,319 --> 00:30:48,879
package it into

891
00:30:46,079 --> 00:30:50,720
a user-friendly clickable approach and

892
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:52,640
there's also a youtube channel and a

893
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:54,880
twitter account where you can find quite

894
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:57,038
a lot of resources on how to use that

895
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:58,159
we're dedicated in mind maintaining this

896
00:30:57,038 --> 00:31:01,359
tool

897
00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:03,120
and and and keeping it updated based on

898
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:04,719
extremely positive feedback from the

899
00:31:03,119 --> 00:31:07,359
community

900
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:09,200
so just quickly what i want to do in at

901
00:31:07,359 --> 00:31:10,959
the bti during my

902
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:12,558
appointment as an assistant professor in

903
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:14,960
here i want to focus on

904
00:31:12,558 --> 00:31:15,918
species that are naturally tolerant to

905
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:17,679
stress

906
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:19,360
and one of them is solan and

907
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:20,000
pimpinellifolio which is the closest

908
00:31:19,359 --> 00:31:22,398
relative

909
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:24,319
of tomato it's native to the west coast

910
00:31:22,398 --> 00:31:27,199
of south america

911
00:31:24,319 --> 00:31:29,119
and and it's it's super tolerant because

912
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:31,200
it survived in my garden in saudi arabia

913
00:31:29,119 --> 00:31:33,439
so i think that's that's a very good

914
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:34,960
argument for working on something i'm a

915
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:38,798
very poor gardener

916
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:39,600
and so faye from the bti they released

917
00:31:38,798 --> 00:31:41,519
the recently

918
00:31:39,599 --> 00:31:42,879
released the reference genome for the

919
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:46,558
pimping elifoleum

920
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:48,480
and we at cause sequence 230 accessions

921
00:31:46,558 --> 00:31:50,480
uh which were right now processing for

922
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:53,200
the snip calling and making it as a

923
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:54,480
as a useful genomic association resource

924
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:56,960
so what we want to do with this

925
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:59,038
population is going to be our guinea pig

926
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:00,079
together with andrew nelson which i was

927
00:31:59,038 --> 00:32:02,240
hired

928
00:32:00,079 --> 00:32:03,918
together with andrew as a cluster hire

929
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:05,919
you can read all about it on the bti

930
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:07,519
website i'm not going to talk that much

931
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:09,038
but what we want to do is we want to

932
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:11,679
phenotype this

933
00:32:09,038 --> 00:32:14,558
population using traditional high

934
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:17,038
throughput phenotyping so scoring growth

935
00:32:14,558 --> 00:32:19,038
chlorophyll fluorescence uh doing

936
00:32:17,038 --> 00:32:20,319
multi-spectral imaging things like that

937
00:32:19,038 --> 00:32:22,640
but also

938
00:32:20,319 --> 00:32:24,720
using raspberry pi phenotyping which

939
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:25,600
will allow us to have much higher time

940
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:27,519
density

941
00:32:25,599 --> 00:32:29,759
so look at the look at the changes that

942
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:31,440
are occurring within minutes

943
00:32:29,759 --> 00:32:33,519
of the plant and that will allow us to

944
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:35,840
identify things that are very much

945
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:37,519
very often overlooked like quiescent

946
00:32:35,839 --> 00:32:39,199
phase that plants undergoing after

947
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:41,200
strength stress exposure

948
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:42,880
and also how quickly the plants recover

949
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:43,919
and what is what are the dynamics of

950
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:47,039
this recovery

951
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:49,679
so those high um

952
00:32:47,038 --> 00:32:50,960
high quality changes in plant growth

953
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:52,720
will allow us to

954
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:55,278
select time points at which we're going

955
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:57,679
to collect more molecular phenotypes

956
00:32:55,278 --> 00:32:58,880
such as transcriptomics metabolomics

957
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:02,080
epigenomics

958
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:04,000
and using all of this data we're going

959
00:33:02,079 --> 00:33:05,439
to be able to perform basically like

960
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,599
gwas on steroids

961
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:09,919
which is not only association between

962
00:33:07,599 --> 00:33:11,839
your phenotype and the snip but also

963
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:13,278
your phenotype and the transcript levels

964
00:33:11,839 --> 00:33:16,079
or metabolome levels

965
00:33:13,278 --> 00:33:17,759
and then this layered approach is going

966
00:33:16,079 --> 00:33:20,240
to allow us to

967
00:33:17,759 --> 00:33:21,200
see which of the associations are very

968
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:24,319
stable

969
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:25,600
and and confirmed by different layers

970
00:33:24,319 --> 00:33:27,359
and also pick ones

971
00:33:25,599 --> 00:33:29,759
pick the ones that that that we're the

972
00:33:27,359 --> 00:33:32,639
most excited about

973
00:33:29,759 --> 00:33:34,158
in the larger scheme of things uh we're

974
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:36,880
we have a very evil plan

975
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:39,039
on exploring not only company volume but

976
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:39,679
closely related cultivated tomato and

977
00:33:39,038 --> 00:33:42,319
then also

978
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:44,240
branch out to all the brassy cases and

979
00:33:42,319 --> 00:33:46,558
later on also to monocots

980
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:47,679
and this comparative framework will

981
00:33:46,558 --> 00:33:49,359
allow us to

982
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:51,278
establish which of the resilience

983
00:33:49,359 --> 00:33:53,359
mechanisms are very short-range

984
00:33:51,278 --> 00:33:54,319
applied and only found in within the

985
00:33:53,359 --> 00:33:56,719
species

986
00:33:54,319 --> 00:33:58,558
medium range so applied and found within

987
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:00,240
the closely related species

988
00:33:58,558 --> 00:34:02,398
and long range and that's that kind of

989
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:04,240
framework will allow us to see

990
00:34:02,398 --> 00:34:06,479
what are the mechanisms that are easily

991
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:07,919
transferable between the species

992
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:10,159
and what are the mechanisms that are

993
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:13,519
more species specific

994
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:17,679
um yeah and in the end

995
00:34:13,519 --> 00:34:20,159
i wanted to thank you for your attention

996
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:22,079
and but also my group that i did a phd

997
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:22,320
so this is krista tester in clubs back

998
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:24,079
at

999
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:26,480
university of amsterdam christa right

1000
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:28,320
now moved on to wageningen university

1001
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:30,480
she was an excellent mentor and gave me

1002
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:33,200
quite a lot of freedom in my phd

1003
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:34,079
then i did a pg postdoc in mark tester's

1004
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:36,398
lab so here

1005
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:37,599
is a basically a look a view from the

1006
00:34:36,398 --> 00:34:40,239
lab we're having

1007
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:41,359
view we're at the red sea coast so mark

1008
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:43,598
was also an excellent

1009
00:34:41,358 --> 00:34:44,878
mentor and and all of those amazing

1010
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:48,079
people

1011
00:34:44,878 --> 00:34:49,279
were were great colleagues and and oops

1012
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:52,240
sorry

1013
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:52,800
um and also all of the collaborators and

1014
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:55,918
colleagues

1015
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:58,000
students from kaust and of course

1016
00:34:55,918 --> 00:35:00,078
last but not least i wanted to thank all

1017
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:02,880
of my new colleagues here at the bti

1018
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:03,920
who are a wonderful team and to work

1019
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:07,599
with so hayley

1020
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:07,920
and liang and of course andrew and anna

1021
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:10,320
who

1022
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:11,200
were absolutely instrumental when i was

1023
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:14,640
starting here

1024
00:35:11,199 --> 00:35:18,078
just clueless about where everything was

1025
00:35:14,639 --> 00:35:20,078
who was doing what and also the bti

1026
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:22,400
senior leadership team who managed to

1027
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:25,680
get me from saudi arabia

1028
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:26,079
to ithaca from all the places during

1029
00:35:25,679 --> 00:35:29,440
this

1030
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:31,519
weird time of kovit and

1031
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:34,000
that's it i would like to welcome all

1032
00:35:31,519 --> 00:35:34,000
the questions

1033
00:35:34,239 --> 00:35:37,598
after a presentation it's always like is

1034
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:40,960
anyone else there

1035
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:42,838
still you can unmute yourselves and ask

1036
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:45,440
a question or you can just put it in

1037
00:35:42,838 --> 00:35:49,119
chat

1038
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:53,200
so magdalena this is voitek um

1039
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:55,358
so in your g was on steroids

1040
00:35:53,199 --> 00:35:56,799
like i you mentioned and i saw it in the

1041
00:35:55,358 --> 00:35:59,519
slide that you want to

1042
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:01,599
take the environment into account as

1043
00:35:59,519 --> 00:36:05,199
well and i wonder like

1044
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:07,280
uh if you could elaborate on that like

1045
00:36:05,199 --> 00:36:09,358
i'm curious like how and are you going

1046
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:11,839
to do it in practice

1047
00:36:09,358 --> 00:36:13,119
yeah so do you so the environment the

1048
00:36:11,838 --> 00:36:15,279
environmental geos

1049
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:17,358
it's it's not our idea i think it

1050
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:20,720
originated from ed buckler

1051
00:36:17,358 --> 00:36:22,719
um from over the road um so what he

1052
00:36:20,719 --> 00:36:23,759
uh what he's do what we're what we would

1053
00:36:22,719 --> 00:36:26,159
be doing then in

1054
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:26,960
environmental g was is collecting the

1055
00:36:26,159 --> 00:36:28,480
gps

1056
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:30,159
coordinates of all of the accessions

1057
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:32,880
where they are originating in

1058
00:36:30,159 --> 00:36:33,679
and then you use the environmental

1059
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:37,039
traits so

1060
00:36:33,679 --> 00:36:39,440
annual precipitation uh temperature

1061
00:36:37,039 --> 00:36:40,159
stuff like that as your phenotypic

1062
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:43,519
traits

1063
00:36:40,159 --> 00:36:45,679
so that that would then if you've got an

1064
00:36:43,519 --> 00:36:48,239
overlapping association between your

1065
00:36:45,679 --> 00:36:50,319
phenotype and this environmental geos

1066
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:51,358
it would say oh this is something that

1067
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:53,440
is causing

1068
00:36:51,358 --> 00:36:55,279
local adaptation to this specific

1069
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:58,240
climate to this specific

1070
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:59,359
environmental variable does that answer

1071
00:36:58,239 --> 00:37:01,679
your question by deck

1072
00:36:59,358 --> 00:37:04,480
yeah sure and so that then you have to

1073
00:37:01,679 --> 00:37:08,719
like pay attention to a geographical

1074
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:11,119
distribution of the

1075
00:37:08,719 --> 00:37:13,279
whatever lines or accessions you're

1076
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:16,079
collecting right

1077
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:16,560
uh you would no well so you would always

1078
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:19,680
have

1079
00:37:16,559 --> 00:37:21,519
a kinship matrix as your co cofactor in

1080
00:37:19,679 --> 00:37:22,000
your duos that that would that would not

1081
00:37:21,519 --> 00:37:24,559
exclude

1082
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:26,239
the need for that uh because running

1083
00:37:24,559 --> 00:37:26,799
that as a co-factor or running it as a

1084
00:37:26,239 --> 00:37:28,879
separate

1085
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:30,560
genome association is very very

1086
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:33,280
different

1087
00:37:30,559 --> 00:37:34,480
but what would yeah so we would be able

1088
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:37,280
to do that but

1089
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:39,039
i also realized based on the work that

1090
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:40,720
i've done on arabidopsis and a lot of

1091
00:37:39,039 --> 00:37:42,000
people are like oh you know all of those

1092
00:37:40,719 --> 00:37:43,759
successions are running

1093
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,760
are from the coast and therefore they

1094
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:47,680
must be more affected by salt

1095
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:49,359
well so this a stress that is very

1096
00:37:47,679 --> 00:37:52,239
difficult to make this kind of

1097
00:37:49,358 --> 00:37:53,199
assumptions based on just global data

1098
00:37:52,239 --> 00:37:56,399
because

1099
00:37:53,199 --> 00:37:58,319
um yeah it's it's very depending on the

1100
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:59,358
type of the soil that you've got and

1101
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:01,920
things like that

1102
00:37:59,358 --> 00:38:03,279
i would assume that the the west coast

1103
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:06,720
of south america

1104
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:08,880
would be less disturbed by by that but

1105
00:38:06,719 --> 00:38:10,799
i don't know i think it would be still

1106
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:12,640
good to good to do it especially

1107
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:14,480
with the stresses that we're planning to

1108
00:38:12,639 --> 00:38:15,279
work on so not only salt but also heat

1109
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:17,920
stress

1110
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:18,640
and drought stress so those parameters

1111
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:20,400
are much

1112
00:38:18,639 --> 00:38:22,239
much easier to estimate from the

1113
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:24,000
environment and the data that is

1114
00:38:22,239 --> 00:38:26,319
available

1115
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,320
thanks

1116
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:33,680
other questions anyone okay i see

1117
00:38:31,039 --> 00:38:36,079
nothing in chat

1118
00:38:33,679 --> 00:38:38,000
okay let's thank mike laner for our

1119
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:40,400
fantastic seminar

1120
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,400
thank you
