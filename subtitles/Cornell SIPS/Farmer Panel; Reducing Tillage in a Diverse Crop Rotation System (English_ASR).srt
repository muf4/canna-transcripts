1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,719
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,679
University so uh we're gonna shift over

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:17,000
to our our our farmer panel so we have

4
00:00:14,679 --> 00:00:18,839
uh Jay goldmark and Dean James who will

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,839
be talking about reducing tillage in a

6
00:00:18,839 --> 00:00:24,559
diverse propop rotation so uh really um

7
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:27,240
grateful to have uh Dean James and Jay

8
00:00:24,559 --> 00:00:29,518
up uh so uh Dean is coming from

9
00:00:27,239 --> 00:00:32,159
Pennsylvania Jay is coming from uh yeah

10
00:00:29,518 --> 00:00:34,119
Central New York so Jay goldmark from

11
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:37,558
Stonehouse grain in Livingston New York

12
00:00:34,119 --> 00:00:39,439
Jay manages Stonehouse grain a 2500 acre

13
00:00:37,558 --> 00:00:41,919
organic grain Farm outside of Hudson New

14
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:44,000
York the farm grows a diverse rotation

15
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,600
of grains legumes hay and cover crops

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,198
while finishing several hundred

17
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:51,198
grass-fed beef each year Stonehouse

18
00:00:48,198 --> 00:00:53,799
grain also runs an on-farm Mill that

19
00:00:51,198 --> 00:00:56,640
processes grains uh that they grow as

20
00:00:53,799 --> 00:00:59,518
well as grains from The Wider Community

21
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:02,439
uh they make animal feed and also um uh

22
00:00:59,518 --> 00:01:04,679
do some food grade grains as well so uh

23
00:01:02,439 --> 00:01:06,640
really uh grateful again to have Jay

24
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:08,680
here to share with us what they're doing

25
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,478
down at Stonehouse and then I'm also

26
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:12,720
going to introduce Dean James at the

27
00:01:10,478 --> 00:01:16,158
same time the other panel member so Dean

28
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:18,519
James U from uh don Cotner farms uh in

29
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:20,920
Danville Pennsylvania so really uh

30
00:01:18,519 --> 00:01:23,359
wonderful to have a Pennsylvania farmer

31
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:25,840
come up to New York and uh share with us

32
00:01:23,359 --> 00:01:27,680
so Dean James manages um yeah the farm I

33
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:30,200
mentioned a fourth generation Farm

34
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:32,560
consisting of 1700 Acres cot Farm Farms

35
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:35,600
started their organic journey in Spring

36
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:38,040
of 2020 so somewhat new to organic

37
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:42,000
farming but a long and deep history of

38
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:44,320
noil and uh and so uh Dean James has U

39
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,560
Been no tilling um for on the farm for

40
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:48,199
over 50 years they now have um but in

41
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:51,159
terms of organic production they now

42
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:53,159
have 200 Acres from what I understand in

43
00:01:51,159 --> 00:01:57,000
certified organic production and they

44
00:01:53,159 --> 00:02:00,000
grow uh corn soybean Rye oat oats uh

45
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,359
spring wheat hay and sunflowers I'm sure

46
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,118
Dean will tell you a little bit more

47
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:06,200
about that when he he speaks the farm is

48
00:02:04,118 --> 00:02:08,239
also affiliated with boy station a

49
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:10,399
processor for organic soybeans and

50
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:11,840
canola so really happy to have these

51
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:13,439
guys here so why don't we welcome them

52
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:16,360
with a round of

53
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:19,079
applause all right Jay okay hi good

54
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:22,760
morning everybody can you hear

55
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:26,040
me all right um it is a pleasure to be

56
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:29,079
here somewhat intimidating so bear with

57
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:31,799
me um it's so good to see many of you in

58
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:34,360
person I talked to a lot of you on the

59
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:38,160
phone more than I see you in person so

60
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:40,280
really great to to be here um I manage

61
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:45,039
ston housee grain we also call it ston

62
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:50,080
housee Farm uh we Farm down in h outside

63
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:53,318
H just north of pipy and south of Al

64
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:55,120
that springs on the east side of the

65
00:02:53,318 --> 00:02:59,039
river

66
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:01,879
um a little bit about the farm um we

67
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:04,798
grow a lot of the typical organic grains

68
00:03:01,878 --> 00:03:08,318
for feed like corn soy beans in food

69
00:03:04,799 --> 00:03:11,760
great stuff like Black beans penil beans

70
00:03:08,318 --> 00:03:16,238
um spring peas winter peas then the

71
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:18,479
medle of small grains um and we do some

72
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:22,920
experimental stuff with sunflowers and

73
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:24,479
flats and oats um we get the idea um the

74
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:29,318
cool thing is we brought a nonfarm

75
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:32,000
animal feed mill and a balanced uh P Tre

76
00:03:29,318 --> 00:03:34,000
diet calls for a lot of cool stuff that

77
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:38,438
we can grow in a diverse crop rotation

78
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:41,400
like uh soybeans corn peas wheat trale

79
00:03:38,438 --> 00:03:44,239
barley too so by having the market on

80
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:47,000
our farm that calls for diverse set of

81
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:50,239
grains it makes us grow a diverse set of

82
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:55,598
grains that's probably really good for

83
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:58,120
our soil um we've been Organics since

84
00:03:55,598 --> 00:04:00,438
practicing Organics since 2013 we just

85
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:04,920
celebrated being 10 years old still

86
00:04:00,438 --> 00:04:08,120
pretty new um and certified in

87
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:10,878
2017 um most of our grains like I said

88
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:14,599
we we mill on the farm it's really

89
00:04:10,878 --> 00:04:16,478
simple we run a Arts way grinder mixer

90
00:04:14,598 --> 00:04:19,319
and then you know make different animal

91
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:22,199
feed products um poultry layers is

92
00:04:19,319 --> 00:04:27,120
probably our biggest seller uh followed

93
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:29,759
by soyf free poultry layer and then hog

94
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:32,720
feed uh here's a look at the overview of

95
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:35,080
the farm um you know we kind of color

96
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:37,280
code everything to try and map out the

97
00:04:35,079 --> 00:04:39,918
logistics so we're not running all over

98
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:44,159
the county um you know the basic

99
00:04:39,918 --> 00:04:47,198
rotation is corn soy or peas uh followed

100
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:49,800
by small grains under so into perennials

101
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:52,800
and then depending on the field and soil

102
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:54,360
type uh if we're really hungry to keep

103
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:58,360
supplying the mill with grain will go

104
00:04:54,360 --> 00:05:00,479
back into corn um but if the soil's not

105
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:03,160
ready we'll kick it into a longer term

106
00:05:00,478 --> 00:05:06,199
PID perennial pasture that then supports

107
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:09,240
our grass fed beef part of the operation

108
00:05:06,199 --> 00:05:11,560
so that the two main pressures they feel

109
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:14,160
like a pressure when you're managing the

110
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:16,160
farm is you got to grow grain from the

111
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:18,680
milk and a lot of different grain so

112
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:20,439
that's kind of good pressure uh and then

113
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:23,120
the other is you got to make a lot of

114
00:05:20,439 --> 00:05:26,680
feed for the cows uh and that's good for

115
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:29,759
the soil so I think by having cows and

116
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:31,840
having the feed mill it it makes it

117
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:33,560
challenging but it overall really makes

118
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:35,679
it so you're you're growing a diverse

119
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:38,120
set of crops in a long-term rotation

120
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:40,478
that ultimately benefits the soil and

121
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:41,639
the energy you have there to C around

122
00:05:40,478 --> 00:05:45,439
anything you

123
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:47,918
want um here's just a real basic look at

124
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:50,000
the the rotation it's it can get more

125
00:05:47,918 --> 00:05:53,079
complicated than this when we grow some

126
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:57,360
of the specialty crops but in general

127
00:05:53,079 --> 00:06:01,000
just like uh you know a

128
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:02,919
stand just like a standard of

129
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
jazz song that starts out with like an

130
00:06:02,918 --> 00:06:06,959
eight

131
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,720
bar or yeah an eight bar chord you can

132
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:12,719
improvise from there so this is our

133
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:16,319
fouryear cord of you know corn and then

134
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:20,280
into ease and then into roll and crimp

135
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:22,479
Ry noil soybeans and then pack into

136
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:26,719
small grains and if everything looks

137
00:06:22,478 --> 00:06:29,839
good you're P into core um and then I

138
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:31,720
guess the point is after you undo your

139
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:34,598
red clover your grasses into small

140
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:36,400
grains that's where you can lengthen the

141
00:06:34,598 --> 00:06:38,598
crop rotation to really build soil

142
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:40,598
health and make hey or if you got fence

143
00:06:38,598 --> 00:06:42,879
and water you can you can graze it for a

144
00:06:40,598 --> 00:06:42,879
few

145
00:06:43,399 --> 00:06:50,079
years um so we all know how to grow corn

146
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:52,400
like like this it takes a lot of work

147
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:54,519
but it's got pretty consistent High

148
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:57,079
yielding

149
00:06:54,519 --> 00:06:59,120
results and then you know in that prop

150
00:06:57,079 --> 00:07:01,120
rotation you need soybeans so you grow

151
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:03,439
them after corn and you can grow them

152
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:09,120
like this and cultivate them uh with

153
00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:11,519
pretty reliable re results too um but uh

154
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:14,240
the moment you st out soybeans because

155
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:16,279
you need peas to satisfy the soyf free

156
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:19,360
customers that are buying your your

157
00:07:16,279 --> 00:07:22,359
poultry feed um you plant your cool

158
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:25,319
season Yellow grain peas in year two F

159
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:27,520
and corn and then you harvest them in

160
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:30,080
mid July and then you can do some cool

161
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:34,439
stuff you can plant cover crops

162
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:36,918
uh like a um rais Crazy Summer Mix from

163
00:07:34,439 --> 00:07:38,560
Rod there um they don't get that still

164
00:07:36,918 --> 00:07:42,000
got plenty of time to put on some

165
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:46,560
biomass um and you can chop it or graze

166
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:48,560
it or make bage to finish beef on that

167
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:52,079
uh and then still plant your fall Ryan

168
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:54,038
for that midt day too and that sets you

169
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:56,519
up for soybeans in your

170
00:07:54,038 --> 00:07:59,158
three um so that's kind of a unique

171
00:07:56,519 --> 00:08:01,240
thing you've got your um your big grass

172
00:07:59,158 --> 00:08:03,598
crop corn and then you go into your cool

173
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:05,598
season legum peas then you do another

174
00:08:03,598 --> 00:08:09,000
warm season legum

175
00:08:05,598 --> 00:08:12,079
soybeans um so it helps kind of break up

176
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,879
that typical rotation and then know

177
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:17,279
here's a great example of grazing your

178
00:08:13,879 --> 00:08:20,840
warm Seasons um they seem to gain really

179
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:20,839
well on the a race grazing

180
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:31,800
mix uh here's just a look at I can't

181
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:33,680
remember which warm season this is but

182
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:35,560
you also can just do nothing instead of

183
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:38,319
hurrying up to plant your Fall Ride just

184
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:40,679
let it um winter fill and then we've had

185
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:43,560
Lu no tilling spring wheat

186
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:47,199
into win killed warm

187
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:48,179
season um or we no till winter week into

188
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:51,640
that as

189
00:08:48,179 --> 00:08:54,000
[Music]

190
00:08:51,639 --> 00:08:56,360
well and then if we're trying to

191
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,519
terminate warm season just to hurry up

192
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:00,159
and plant another cover crop sometimes

193
00:08:58,519 --> 00:09:02,799
doesn't always make sense

194
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:05,559
but um for no till soybeans that's what

195
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:07,479
Plan called for so we go out there in

196
00:09:05,559 --> 00:09:10,278
early September and hit it with the

197
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:14,440
highs speeed disc uh this was a mix from

198
00:09:10,278 --> 00:09:19,600
over Le the 10 away um mix with sorum

199
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:22,079
cityan CIS on so on um yeah those warm

200
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:24,230
seasons are so cool that to break up

201
00:09:22,078 --> 00:09:27,519
compaction in in the

202
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:27,519
[Music]

203
00:09:27,639 --> 00:09:33,360
heavier there we go

204
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:36,519
and it's it's Rocky you can

205
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:39,680
hear that field I didn't realize this so

206
00:09:36,519 --> 00:09:42,959
that field is where we grew no tail corn

207
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:48,078
this year uh that's

208
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:50,518
interesting um so when we uh yeah we

209
00:09:48,078 --> 00:09:53,199
high speed disc the warm seasons and

210
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:55,560
then with a no till drill slices right

211
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:59,720
through it again in our ride and like

212
00:09:55,559 --> 00:10:04,599
Aaron was saying we our rotic RI to the

213
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:04,600
acre and really try and get it in by mid

214
00:10:06,159 --> 00:10:12,199
September and then if all goes

215
00:10:08,759 --> 00:10:16,159
well um the following late May is when

216
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:16,930
nesis typically hits us around Hudson we

217
00:10:16,159 --> 00:10:18,799
can lay it

218
00:10:16,929 --> 00:10:22,799
[Music]

219
00:10:18,799 --> 00:10:25,319
down um and then we're out there um this

220
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:29,479
is a field we did no till soybeans on

221
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:32,040
it's a really heavy clay field uh it the

222
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:35,159
moment we try and fill it in the spring

223
00:10:32,039 --> 00:10:38,039
it just turns into a disaster so this

224
00:10:35,159 --> 00:10:41,278
was actually a great way to treat a a

225
00:10:38,039 --> 00:10:44,838
heavier soil field um not to till it at

226
00:10:41,278 --> 00:10:48,078
all so sometimes the joke is well no

227
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:50,240
till yields less um but then on a field

228
00:10:48,078 --> 00:10:52,958
like this it it yields more than if we

229
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:56,959
would have killed

230
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:59,479
it um so yeah what what Matt and Kristen

231
00:10:56,958 --> 00:11:03,399
were good about like okay uh talk about

232
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:06,200
what motivated you to try planting notto

233
00:11:03,399 --> 00:11:08,799
um and on the farm uh when we're trying

234
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:11,480
to run around say 1500 Acres of

235
00:11:08,799 --> 00:11:14,759
cultivated crop ground you just start to

236
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:18,079
run out of time um and so it's it seems

237
00:11:14,759 --> 00:11:20,958
like um a well balanced portfolio to

238
00:11:18,078 --> 00:11:23,239
have you know 70% of the farm or some

239
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:25,759
ratio of the farm in

240
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:28,240
cultivated Acres but then to try and

241
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:30,600
Target some of your soils that maybe you

242
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:32,399
least ground far away from the shop or

243
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:35,200
some ground that just it's hard to tell

244
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:36,759
to keep that in no till uh Because by

245
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:39,600
the time you finish Road crop

246
00:11:36,759 --> 00:11:42,319
cultivating corn and then soybeans uh

247
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:45,519
the crew is pretty tired of running late

248
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:47,560
nights and then when you get up to oh we

249
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:50,039
still have like 200 Acres of soybeans

250
00:11:47,559 --> 00:11:52,000
and then oh those are no beans everybody

251
00:11:50,039 --> 00:11:55,519
breeds the S Rel you don't have to do

252
00:11:52,000 --> 00:12:00,000
anything um so it it's pretty cool to be

253
00:11:55,519 --> 00:12:03,399
able to plant no till and then uh

254
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:07,799
kind of walk away and go back and take

255
00:12:03,399 --> 00:12:07,799
pictures and come that Harvest

256
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:12,639
Time um I see a lot of photos I'm so

257
00:12:11,639 --> 00:12:15,480
glad

258
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:17,159
that Aon Silva showed photos of harvest

259
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:20,000
time because you look at all the awesome

260
00:12:17,159 --> 00:12:23,198
seed catalogs and often times you see

261
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,919
photos in like late June early July the

262
00:12:23,198 --> 00:12:27,039
soybeans are really nice and clean the

263
00:12:24,919 --> 00:12:29,360
corn is nice and clean um but then of

264
00:12:27,039 --> 00:12:32,278
course they don't show all the the warm

265
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:34,480
season weeds to come on in Mid July and

266
00:12:32,278 --> 00:12:37,360
August uh so I thought I'd throw this

267
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:40,680
clip in this is our this is a no soybean

268
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:43,278
field um you know hardly any broadlees

269
00:12:40,679 --> 00:12:45,759
we do have a lot of box steel pressure

270
00:12:43,278 --> 00:12:47,629
there um so it it goes right through

271
00:12:45,759 --> 00:12:48,919
theine after a frost

272
00:12:47,629 --> 00:12:51,559
[Music]

273
00:12:48,919 --> 00:12:53,559
filling night but of course we do

274
00:12:51,559 --> 00:12:58,719
scatter some weed seeds

275
00:12:53,559 --> 00:13:00,479
there um I guess that uh overall seems

276
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:02,920
like we're finding a place in the

277
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:04,920
rotation to experiment planting noil

278
00:13:02,919 --> 00:13:07,679
with winter wheat spring wheat into

279
00:13:04,919 --> 00:13:10,838
those warm season mixes like I

280
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:14,638
mentioned um and just relay cover croing

281
00:13:10,839 --> 00:13:17,000
so if we get better at um you know with

282
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:19,278
a warm season instead of discing it you

283
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:22,159
could just run right through it uh with

284
00:13:19,278 --> 00:13:25,799
cows and graze it and then no till in

285
00:13:22,159 --> 00:13:27,799
you're R um you know trying things like

286
00:13:25,799 --> 00:13:29,759
that uh and then of course any

287
00:13:27,799 --> 00:13:33,278
opportunity we have to Frost seed

288
00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:36,639
clovers or mustards or if we're going to

289
00:13:33,278 --> 00:13:39,078
after small grains go into a a longer

290
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:42,079
term pasture we

291
00:13:39,078 --> 00:13:45,519
just there's ways to frosted your your

292
00:13:42,078 --> 00:13:48,000
grass um

293
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:51,799
so some of the exciting things we did

294
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:54,480
this year were uh related to noil Horn

295
00:13:51,799 --> 00:13:58,159
uh like Aon Sila said don't try this on

296
00:13:54,480 --> 00:14:01,879
a large scale uh we did it with the Ryan

297
00:13:58,159 --> 00:14:03,759
lab On th Acres which is the largest

298
00:14:01,879 --> 00:14:05,639
Mount we've ever done so this is that

299
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:07,919
same field I think two years prior it

300
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:11,120
was in that warm season mix that we were

301
00:14:07,919 --> 00:14:14,159
highpe ising it's kind of it's got some

302
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:19,278
rock it's kind of cobbly uh and this

303
00:14:14,159 --> 00:14:24,319
year since last year 2024 um it uh it

304
00:14:19,278 --> 00:14:26,559
dried out um but what was cool is that

305
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:27,680
uh see I don't know if you can tell but

306
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:29,638
that picture on the right with the

307
00:14:27,679 --> 00:14:32,319
planter uh we're just planting right

308
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:34,600
through standing bench um we've never

309
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:37,759
done that before the Ryan lab really

310
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:42,399
encouraged us to try it out and it

311
00:14:37,759 --> 00:14:45,720
worked really slick um so this was June

312
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:48,360
10th uh and a room full of farmers June

313
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:52,320
10th is the last state you can ensure

314
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:53,759
your corn crop at 100% uh rate so that

315
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:56,839
worked out pretty cool that we could

316
00:14:53,759 --> 00:15:01,039
still ensure no tail corn at the at the

317
00:14:56,839 --> 00:15:01,040
five 100% of the 5year car average

318
00:15:03,159 --> 00:15:09,399
um here we are June 19th so 9 days later

319
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:11,560
I me I plant notes of corn you just walk

320
00:15:09,399 --> 00:15:15,480
away and look like nothing's going to

321
00:15:11,559 --> 00:15:18,719
ever grow there um but the corn started

322
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:21,519
to come up um and this was during that

323
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:24,879
heat wave uh you know we were in a

324
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:26,679
drought and the you know our another

325
00:15:24,879 --> 00:15:28,639
look at our cultivated corn on the same

326
00:15:26,679 --> 00:15:33,078
day you know the Headlands are starting

327
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:35,360
to to wilt there um but that little

328
00:15:33,078 --> 00:15:37,758
Spiker corn doesn't even know it yet it

329
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:41,039
seemed pretty

330
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:43,720
protective let's see so five days later

331
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:46,519
we are rowing up through the through the

332
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:48,278
rolling crimp very vetch can't remember

333
00:15:46,519 --> 00:15:49,879
if we rolled it by this point but we

334
00:15:48,278 --> 00:15:52,078
basically really didn't need to even

335
00:15:49,879 --> 00:15:55,000
roll and crimp the vetch just by

336
00:15:52,078 --> 00:15:58,120
planting into it standing and the the

337
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:00,240
Heat and drought conditions of the the

338
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:03,120
double disc open on the planner seemed

339
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:06,000
seem to slice and kill the VCH so when

340
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:09,000
we did roll it probably around there or

341
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,839
maybe just a little bit before there um

342
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,600
you know flatten the corn in the one to

343
00:16:10,839 --> 00:16:14,240
two we stage but the corn came right

344
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:16,560
back again something I never would have

345
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:19,799
tried it's the Ryan lab and said yeah

346
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:23,119
we've done it try it out and it worked

347
00:16:19,799 --> 00:16:25,078
um and then the corn kept and I just

348
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:28,959
kept doing great even though it was a

349
00:16:25,078 --> 00:16:32,159
really weird hot dry year um you know

350
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:34,559
August 5th we started the tel out uh on

351
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:37,318
that 30 acre block we did five different

352
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:39,679
varieties uh shortest day was 88 the

353
00:16:37,318 --> 00:16:43,799
longest day was

354
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:45,799
102 um so here we are at Harvest Time um

355
00:16:43,799 --> 00:16:48,329
out of the five

356
00:16:45,799 --> 00:16:51,418
varieties yeah here's the

357
00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:51,419
[Music]

358
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:57,800
97 but you kind have to see it to

359
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:59,480
believe it I never thought this would

360
00:16:57,799 --> 00:17:02,439
work out this well

361
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:03,678
um uh SMI who's R the combine here was

362
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:07,880
just over the

363
00:17:03,678 --> 00:17:10,119
moon just said like over 200 per second

364
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:13,720
um I think that variety averaged

365
00:17:10,119 --> 00:17:18,918
126 o was an acre over a 9 acre block of

366
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:22,318
just that variety U then the 102 day did

367
00:17:18,919 --> 00:17:24,240
um what did it

368
00:17:22,318 --> 00:17:27,399
do

369
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:29,079
132 no sorry the 95 day did the best at

370
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:33,840
132

371
00:17:29,079 --> 00:17:36,960
P anchor um so I was you know joking

372
00:17:33,839 --> 00:17:39,480
last night I think if if we did this on

373
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:43,240
a large scale I want hydraulic down

374
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:46,440
pressure on a planter um but it gave us

375
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:49,359
kind of a crazy amount of confidence to

376
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:51,640
to keep keep experimenting and scaling

377
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:55,000
this up it seemed to work really well

378
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:57,240
even on a dry year um but I think it

379
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:00,480
depends on your soil type too I mean we

380
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:02,919
did a control we did till I think 5

381
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:05,200
Acres of that field we yeah we plowed

382
00:18:02,919 --> 00:18:08,440
down 5 Acres of that field for control

383
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:12,679
and planted 95 day horn and it it dried

384
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:12,679
out and definitely was imped by lack of

385
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:20,120
moisture here's just another few clips

386
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:20,120
for no planting soybeans and roll

387
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:30,000
PR here we are when I was working with

388
00:18:27,359 --> 00:18:33,119
Jeff at the farmhub we were Zone

389
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:36,279
building through standing ride uh before

390
00:18:33,119 --> 00:18:39,000
planting dry beans and this was just an

391
00:18:36,279 --> 00:18:43,480
attempt to try and actually the soil was

392
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:45,640
really wet and cold so we were trying to

393
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:49,880
um get through the ride before we rolled

394
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:53,400
it so we wouldn't Wad and ball up um and

395
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:56,159
so we're loosening on the the seed zones

396
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:59,080
and aerating the soil and warming it up

397
00:18:56,159 --> 00:19:02,039
and then a couple days later we came

398
00:18:59,079 --> 00:19:05,319
back in and rolled

399
00:19:02,038 --> 00:19:08,158
it which was kind of scary because then

400
00:19:05,319 --> 00:19:10,558
we thought oh no we can't find our feed

401
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:12,559
lines anymore but around the same time

402
00:19:10,558 --> 00:19:15,319
we were learning about how to how to

403
00:19:12,558 --> 00:19:17,000
share GPS lines which is really cool

404
00:19:15,319 --> 00:19:21,119
with organic farming because now you can

405
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:23,720
create these layers and layers um so we

406
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:25,759
then came back and planted on the same

407
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:29,519
pre R zone with the

408
00:19:25,759 --> 00:19:31,440
planter um and I don't have any pictures

409
00:19:29,519 --> 00:19:34,480
of the of the beans we but they they

410
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:38,640
turned out really good and we're still

411
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:42,360
trying to grow beans as good as we did

412
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:44,720
back uh these on were P beans think it

413
00:19:42,359 --> 00:19:44,719
was like

414
00:19:48,679 --> 00:19:52,720
lar beginn

415
00:19:50,450 --> 00:19:56,319
[Music]

416
00:19:52,720 --> 00:20:02,759
Lu uh here's just a close look of like a

417
00:19:56,319 --> 00:20:02,759
a the seed trench in the soy you can see

418
00:20:04,519 --> 00:20:12,558
the anyway uh you see that we use micro

419
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:15,519
risal inoculant in the C box um just to

420
00:20:12,558 --> 00:20:17,759
try and help the bi the SE and help it

421
00:20:15,519 --> 00:20:19,079
partner with microbes in the soil and if

422
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:20,798
you look on that picture on the right

423
00:20:19,079 --> 00:20:22,839
there's like a little cat mushroom there

424
00:20:20,798 --> 00:20:26,319
too so there's a lot of biology

425
00:20:22,839 --> 00:20:26,319
underneath that that stat

426
00:20:26,839 --> 00:20:35,918
of um what we're learn about noil um

427
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:39,480
like as already today uh noil soy beans

428
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:43,080
works really well um know till corn is

429
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:46,679
still a bit of a wild card but uh I'm

430
00:20:43,079 --> 00:20:49,439
I'm pretty excited about it and uh it's

431
00:20:46,679 --> 00:20:53,038
so hard to scale organic farming I mean

432
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:56,200
2% of all us Farmland is organic

433
00:20:53,038 --> 00:20:58,158
certified um there's a reason for that

434
00:20:56,200 --> 00:21:01,279
and I think one of the reasons is really

435
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:05,360
really diff diffult to for a family farm

436
00:21:01,279 --> 00:21:08,200
and one Farm operation to grow and scale

437
00:21:05,359 --> 00:21:10,319
in size just because cultivation is a

438
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:13,278
real um

439
00:21:10,319 --> 00:21:15,798
bottleneck um so how can we do it I

440
00:21:13,278 --> 00:21:20,000
think through just Innovative noil

441
00:21:15,798 --> 00:21:22,918
techniques when you could a 12 row or or

442
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:25,919
you know a nice big planter go out um

443
00:21:22,919 --> 00:21:29,440
and plant a lot of corn uh into into

444
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:33,159
standing veg that that could be a good

445
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:35,798
day um so we still really don't know

446
00:21:33,159 --> 00:21:37,440
what to do after we plant no till corn

447
00:21:35,798 --> 00:21:40,158
because there is the vetch that comes

448
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:42,440
back um so we typically just kick it

449
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:45,200
into a air rotation to manage the the

450
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:46,960
vet and makes great great

451
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:48,440
Forge and then we're going to keep

452
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:52,759
experimenting with different fall cover

453
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:54,759
crops to set up um for notil corn uh bch

454
00:21:52,759 --> 00:21:57,960
and oats is kind of our standard you

455
00:21:54,759 --> 00:21:59,200
know see 30 pounds of bch 100 pounds

456
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:02,640
oats

457
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:05,038
um and then the Max and fixation mix Le

458
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:08,360
is pretty interesting we've been growing

459
00:22:05,038 --> 00:22:11,158
that as a as a coverop for plow down

460
00:22:08,359 --> 00:22:13,519
corn um but then we started to let it go

461
00:22:11,159 --> 00:22:16,600
too long and it started to Bunch up and

462
00:22:13,519 --> 00:22:19,319
create problems for the plow uh and then

463
00:22:16,599 --> 00:22:21,199
on one piece we saidd don't even plow it

464
00:22:19,319 --> 00:22:25,278
let's just plant right into it and

465
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:27,679
that's started to work pretty good too

466
00:22:25,278 --> 00:22:30,519
um and then always interested what

467
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:32,360
happens when you you do less so with a

468
00:22:30,519 --> 00:22:35,639
warm season crop we have established

469
00:22:32,359 --> 00:22:38,240
after PE um you know if we graze it with

470
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:40,480
our cows and let it Naturally Winter

471
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:44,278
kill maybe we touch it up once with a

472
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:45,640
high disc and plant corn um so those are

473
00:22:44,278 --> 00:22:48,400
some kind of

474
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:53,278
low uh low impact ways we're thinking

475
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:57,278
about going forward um but like uh erand

476
00:22:53,278 --> 00:22:59,278
that small and scale up um if things are

477
00:22:57,278 --> 00:23:02,000
working well

478
00:22:59,278 --> 00:23:02,000
that's it thank

479
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:06,798
you so I think we have time for one

480
00:23:04,919 --> 00:23:08,360
question maybe for Jay while we switch

481
00:23:06,798 --> 00:23:10,400
slides so if there's anyone that has a

482
00:23:08,359 --> 00:23:12,558
burning question there will be time

483
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:15,559
after uh Dean presents as well for

484
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:17,399
questions but if anybody wants to uh ask

485
00:23:15,558 --> 00:23:19,678
Jay about what he was just talking about

486
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:21,400
yeah this would be a good time to do it

487
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:24,919
any problems with

488
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:26,798
slugs yes um we've never done anything

489
00:23:24,919 --> 00:23:29,278
about it but we go out and count them

490
00:23:26,798 --> 00:23:31,038
especially our our neighbors will call

491
00:23:29,278 --> 00:23:32,919
and say hey yeah we just had to replant

492
00:23:31,038 --> 00:23:35,119
you know a bunch of soy soy that you

493
00:23:32,919 --> 00:23:38,000
check you scattered your Fields they're

494
00:23:35,119 --> 00:23:39,759
they're out there um and that's maybe

495
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,759
why some of the fields are a little less

496
00:23:39,759 --> 00:23:46,278
with noil stor I'm guess that's what

497
00:23:41,759 --> 00:23:49,278
you're talking about yeah um you know

498
00:23:46,278 --> 00:23:49,278
just

499
00:23:49,359 --> 00:23:53,759
spray I think we're going to shift over

500
00:23:51,519 --> 00:23:55,798
here so yeah really inspiring and great

501
00:23:53,759 --> 00:23:58,558
to see some of the the results from the

502
00:23:55,798 --> 00:23:59,879
work at Jay's place there so Dean going

503
00:23:58,558 --> 00:24:01,678
to take over now and tell us about what

504
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:04,679
he's been up

505
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:04,679
to

506
00:24:05,278 --> 00:24:10,640
but lot of familiar faces here um I

507
00:24:08,679 --> 00:24:12,080
think it's really good between Matt and

508
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:14,600
Aaron I mean they're pretty good

509
00:24:12,079 --> 00:24:17,319
Educators that's where we learn we've

510
00:24:14,599 --> 00:24:20,038
been no till on Farm like Matt said for

511
00:24:17,319 --> 00:24:22,319
50 some years so when the work came down

512
00:24:20,038 --> 00:24:24,879
from up above we should try this organic

513
00:24:22,319 --> 00:24:26,720
thing we really hung our heads but we

514
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,840
went out and did like a lot of you guys

515
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:32,159
we spent a lot of time on YouTube and

516
00:24:28,839 --> 00:24:34,720
podcast and everything and and uh

517
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:37,000
decided that we'd try this um through

518
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:39,360
transition especially and see how we

519
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:41,200
made out this is just a picture of some

520
00:24:39,359 --> 00:24:43,439
roll down Ride This is how we do a lot

521
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:45,399
of our conventional farming and how we

522
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:47,399
knew that this stuff could work and

523
00:24:45,398 --> 00:24:49,158
we've even tried things on the

524
00:24:47,398 --> 00:24:51,319
conventional side in case it got out of

525
00:24:49,159 --> 00:24:53,520
hand we could control just to evolve it

526
00:24:51,319 --> 00:24:56,158
into the

527
00:24:53,519 --> 00:24:58,000
organic this was our corn experiment the

528
00:24:56,159 --> 00:25:02,399
first year we went into with a lot of

529
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:05,919
high folks um we had our leges there was

530
00:25:02,398 --> 00:25:09,239
crimson clover and vet and of course the

531
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:13,720
Rye um we waited until the ride was in

532
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:15,599
an to plant horn um the way we do it we

533
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:17,679
see Road Dale you know there's a lot of

534
00:25:15,599 --> 00:25:19,719
guys talking about roller crimping and I

535
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:21,600
don't know how you guys did it Matt roll

536
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:23,440
you know crimp her eye and implanted our

537
00:25:21,599 --> 00:25:26,319
thing has always been play and then

538
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:29,278
crimp um and it was good to see you got

539
00:25:26,319 --> 00:25:31,720
Aon talk about that the other thing we

540
00:25:29,278 --> 00:25:35,159
often thought was because we could print

541
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:36,880
later we could actually kind of go a

542
00:25:35,159 --> 00:25:38,960
little bit against the drain you know on

543
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:41,919
an angle so things would cover the row

544
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:43,919
up keep the weeds out of the row but

545
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:47,240
this this was our mix this is what we

546
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:49,759
were doing um but there again it was a

547
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:51,359
learning curve because the Rye was ready

548
00:25:49,759 --> 00:25:55,079
to be rolled the crimson clover and the

549
00:25:51,359 --> 00:25:57,839
vet was not so we went both ways on this

550
00:25:55,079 --> 00:25:59,599
field to get the ride down and the

551
00:25:57,839 --> 00:26:02,199
crimson just grew back up and we had to

552
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:04,480
come back later on and roll that

553
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:07,278
also um this is kind of what it looks

554
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:10,200
like I good pictur like to see I think

555
00:26:07,278 --> 00:26:12,480
that's actually some some s and2 inch

556
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:14,960
beans that we've done too so we've been

557
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:17,399
there um our first year there again on

558
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:18,840
the bean side was we were at O greens

559
00:26:17,398 --> 00:26:21,119
and you know we went out to supper and

560
00:26:18,839 --> 00:26:22,918
there was a guy from Wisconsin or

561
00:26:21,119 --> 00:26:25,319
Michigan and he was talking about non

562
00:26:22,919 --> 00:26:28,278
vertil ride he spoke up pretty highly

563
00:26:25,319 --> 00:26:30,000
that so we tried that we tried the Romo

564
00:26:28,278 --> 00:26:32,599
Pro concept pushing the lawn mower up

565
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,839
and down the roads we you know but

566
00:26:32,599 --> 00:26:37,719
because we wanted to stay the noil the

567
00:26:34,839 --> 00:26:39,759
covered soils um you know they say it

568
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:43,038
takes what 200 years to develop an inch

569
00:26:39,759 --> 00:26:45,720
of soil top soil so it's pretty critical

570
00:26:43,038 --> 00:26:47,720
and you know let's say having been NOA

571
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:51,720
for for as long as we are that's been

572
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:54,200
the big thing is the uh CAU out the

573
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:57,200
erosion so this was this was a picture

574
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:58,880
after the corn was coming up it uh looks

575
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:00,558
pretty good you can see the closure

576
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:03,278
laying there we thought we were off to a

577
00:27:00,558 --> 00:27:05,639
pretty good start couple of broad leaves

578
00:27:03,278 --> 00:27:08,038
there um down here in the

579
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:09,759
corner you can kind of see some vets

580
00:27:08,038 --> 00:27:14,480
that that wasn't taken out but a little

581
00:27:09,759 --> 00:27:16,359
bit was not a big deal we figured we V

582
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:18,960
but then as the season went on this is

583
00:27:16,359 --> 00:27:21,599
what we were seeing stand wasn't there

584
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:24,159
um we contacted different folks and

585
00:27:21,599 --> 00:27:27,519
talked about it and they were thinking

586
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:29,760
it was a planning depth issue um but I

587
00:27:27,519 --> 00:27:31,918
need to quantify that with our planner

588
00:27:29,759 --> 00:27:35,000
we do have a a plan with hydraulic

589
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:37,360
downforce so it was not an issue there

590
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:39,079
um I kind of highly recommend if you're

591
00:27:37,359 --> 00:27:41,959
going to plant through thick covers is

592
00:27:39,079 --> 00:27:44,519
is to have that and if you're not plant

593
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:46,720
the end Rose first because you won't get

594
00:27:44,519 --> 00:27:48,960
a stand on the endr where the r is laid

595
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:52,000
over it really is harder to get through

596
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:54,200
and we had airbags on the last planner

597
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,200
and uh we're not able to plant through

598
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:59,840
until we've got the hydraulic down

599
00:27:56,200 --> 00:28:02,159
flors um we don't run a road cleaner in

600
00:27:59,839 --> 00:28:05,278
this we don't run a a colder in this

601
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:07,159
it's just a double dis openers and as as

602
00:28:05,278 --> 00:28:10,558
things have progressed we realized that

603
00:28:07,159 --> 00:28:10,559
we don't need a sep

604
00:28:11,119 --> 00:28:17,398
F but this to this is some things that

605
00:28:13,798 --> 00:28:19,398
we we were seeing uneven emergence V5

606
00:28:17,398 --> 00:28:21,599
and V3 form right there next to each

607
00:28:19,398 --> 00:28:23,798
other so we knew the yield wasn't going

608
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:28,719
to be really good

609
00:28:23,798 --> 00:28:32,599
um but we did did did get it all and uh

610
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:33,839
it yielded like 65 bushel so we thought

611
00:28:32,599 --> 00:28:36,079
we're not going to throw it out we

612
00:28:33,839 --> 00:28:39,000
figured we got to try it again second

613
00:28:36,079 --> 00:28:40,960
year it turned dry eyes between the deer

614
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,480
and dry weather we never ran the combine

615
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:45,798
through the field so we've been pretty

616
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:47,720
discouraged but it's good to see Jay

617
00:28:45,798 --> 00:28:50,639
offer some encouragement maybe there is

618
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:52,839
a way to make it work um this was

619
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:55,320
another experiment that we ran we were

620
00:28:52,839 --> 00:28:58,119
transitioned in this field this was a

621
00:28:55,319 --> 00:29:00,558
year prior to trying to grow Suns Sun

622
00:28:58,119 --> 00:29:02,199
flowers so we decided our planner was

623
00:29:00,558 --> 00:29:04,678
wide enough we wanted to try three

624
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:06,200
scenarios go through the roller Crim

625
00:29:04,679 --> 00:29:10,038
grow through some work ground and then

626
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:12,159
plan green um the one thing we found was

627
00:29:10,038 --> 00:29:14,720
that the only place we had any stand was

628
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:16,799
where it was be ground so that kind of

629
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:19,319
toss that out I'm not sure if anyone

630
00:29:16,798 --> 00:29:23,119
else's has done that or not with sons

631
00:29:19,319 --> 00:29:24,678
but um it'd be nice to be able to do it

632
00:29:23,119 --> 00:29:27,000
um after seeing the erosion there and

633
00:29:24,679 --> 00:29:29,480
talk about the hard rainfalls that we're

634
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:31,319
getting nowadays and it is it's kind of

635
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:34,159
a tough thing to see your soil

636
00:29:31,319 --> 00:29:35,720
walk um the birds made out really well

637
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:38,399
on the sunflowers there they cleaned

638
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:41,679
them all in that

639
00:29:38,398 --> 00:29:43,879
year so this is this is kind of where

640
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:45,278
we've evolved to now we're we're still

641
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:51,240
trying to

642
00:29:45,278 --> 00:29:52,558
grow beans and Ry and we know that if uh

643
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:54,399
if we're going to do that we've got to

644
00:29:52,558 --> 00:29:56,960
have a good stand to ride one thing that

645
00:29:54,398 --> 00:30:00,599
we've learned through Penn State about

646
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:03,480
small grains is to get it tillered out

647
00:30:00,599 --> 00:30:06,119
and so this ground had had the layer

648
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:08,278
maneuver spread on it prior to the the

649
00:30:06,119 --> 00:30:11,398
riding plan and you can see that picture

650
00:30:08,278 --> 00:30:13,240
was just taken last early last week so

651
00:30:11,398 --> 00:30:15,199
you can see how it is hopefully it'll

652
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:17,200
it'll do what we want to do with it but

653
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:19,600
that's one thing to keep in mind is is

654
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:22,080
you got to make a judgment call on your

655
00:30:19,599 --> 00:30:24,000
stand when when you do this when you're

656
00:30:22,079 --> 00:30:25,158
playing beans because if you don't

657
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,119
you're going to have a mess you're going

658
00:30:25,159 --> 00:30:29,519
to have Ry coming in the row and beside

659
00:30:27,119 --> 00:30:30,918
the row you can't get cated out and

660
00:30:29,519 --> 00:30:34,839
we've done that already we've taken a

661
00:30:30,919 --> 00:30:36,278
field of ride out that didn't didn't uh

662
00:30:34,839 --> 00:30:38,720
look like it was going to do what it was

663
00:30:36,278 --> 00:30:38,720
supposed to

664
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:47,480
be there's another picture of that

665
00:30:42,679 --> 00:30:50,440
ride so um we've evolved through a lot

666
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:52,798
of a lot of different things um we

667
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:55,320
wanted to try playing some beans into a

668
00:30:52,798 --> 00:30:59,918
good stand of winnery so this is this is

669
00:30:55,319 --> 00:30:59,918
what we did um

670
00:31:00,798 --> 00:31:08,158
it's it's come a long way the one thing

671
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:11,679
that uh we did have do after was

672
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:13,480
planned this this is roller roller crimp

673
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:15,720
um the one thing on roller crimpers our

674
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:18,720
is a 30 foot roller crimper but it has

675
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:20,839
three sections um to do it again we'd

676
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:22,720
rather have more sections for uneven

677
00:31:20,839 --> 00:31:25,519
ground so it follows the ground

678
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:27,679
Contour seem the legings are not not

679
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:30,679
hard to kill but it's the grass it's the

680
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:32,399
the R and and they do continue to suck

681
00:31:30,679 --> 00:31:35,000
suck moisture out of the soil it doesn't

682
00:31:32,398 --> 00:31:37,398
kill it immediately

683
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,119
so this is the field of beans a little

684
00:31:37,398 --> 00:31:40,359
bit

685
00:31:38,119 --> 00:31:41,918
later you can see there's a few broad

686
00:31:40,359 --> 00:31:44,959
leaves coming in

687
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:47,799
there um there it is U we did go back

688
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:51,440
through that a with a high residue

689
00:31:47,798 --> 00:31:53,679
culator um those beans did 35 Bush

690
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:55,798
course which was a little off far

691
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:57,519
average but some of the thoughts where

692
00:31:55,798 --> 00:32:00,158
that field is really stuning kind of

693
00:31:57,519 --> 00:32:02,960
Drive so we're wondering if that's not

694
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:05,720
what it is but we're willing to try it

695
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:07,639
again so if there are um so at this

696
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:10,399
point we're going to transition over to

697
00:32:07,638 --> 00:32:12,519
uh more of a discussion so uh we have

698
00:32:10,398 --> 00:32:14,599
some if you have questions for the

699
00:32:12,519 --> 00:32:16,399
panelists this is the time to ask um we

700
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:17,879
have some questions that um we are

701
00:32:16,398 --> 00:32:20,199
thinking about as well but want to turn

702
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:21,720
it over to you first and just see uh

703
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:23,519
based on what you were hearing a lot of

704
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:25,839
discussion about reducing tillage in

705
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:27,359
organic systems again trying to protect

706
00:32:25,839 --> 00:32:29,918
our our soil Health that we've worked so

707
00:32:27,359 --> 00:32:31,638
hard to build up um but I thought yeah

708
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:34,080
some very interesting stories from from

709
00:32:31,638 --> 00:32:35,719
Jay and from Dean so uh I don't know if

710
00:32:34,079 --> 00:32:38,278
anyone in the audience has any questions

711
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:40,759
wants to uh kick things off for the

712
00:32:38,278 --> 00:32:44,359
panel discussion at this

713
00:32:40,759 --> 00:32:47,000
point in the back I was wondering either

714
00:32:44,359 --> 00:32:50,798
of you considered or saw did any side by

715
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,798
side see there any value

716
00:32:53,038 --> 00:32:59,119
start we we typically we put fish in the

717
00:32:57,599 --> 00:33:00,558
row

718
00:32:59,119 --> 00:33:04,879
I'm not sure the rate that we put fish

719
00:33:00,558 --> 00:33:08,278
in the road and also chal to the side

720
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:10,559
just try to get going in the corn there

721
00:33:08,278 --> 00:33:13,079
the pictures I showed to the roll down

722
00:33:10,558 --> 00:33:15,440
covers we knew that you know there was

723
00:33:13,079 --> 00:33:16,839
going to be a lot of nit high up and

724
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:20,639
that's the one thing that's kind of

725
00:33:16,839 --> 00:33:25,240
tough to get past is you know the ride

726
00:33:20,638 --> 00:33:27,599
um so we know that there is a lot of

727
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:29,759
that I in the conven side keep talking

728
00:33:27,599 --> 00:33:32,278
about about that but you know we

729
00:33:29,759 --> 00:33:34,319
overcame the ride some folks called

730
00:33:32,278 --> 00:33:37,679
mopath

731
00:33:34,319 --> 00:33:41,599
in by adding like 60 units in we weren't

732
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:44,278
able to do that on the organic the form

733
00:33:41,599 --> 00:33:47,599
so we kind of backed off trying to do

734
00:33:44,278 --> 00:33:47,599
anything now

735
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:55,879
with this okay uh we haven't done any

736
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:58,038
side by side uh trials by the time we

737
00:33:55,880 --> 00:34:00,039
finished the cultivated

738
00:33:58,038 --> 00:34:02,480
to get to the no tail ground we try to

739
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:05,960
leave the planner just the exact same

740
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:09,440
way it's set up so we put down uh liquid

741
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:13,440
micronutrients and organic Gem and and

742
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:15,720
bio SE Ulin um it's interesting because

743
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:17,559
it doesn't really go down in with the

744
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:19,678
sea because it's riding on top of the

745
00:34:17,559 --> 00:34:21,878
mulch it's going out through the Katon

746
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:24,079
seed permer but I think the liquid's

747
00:34:21,878 --> 00:34:25,838
getting close to the seed and that's

748
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:28,399
what we're hoping for there's biology

749
00:34:25,838 --> 00:34:31,000
around the seed

750
00:34:28,398 --> 00:34:31,000
the answer is

751
00:34:31,889 --> 00:34:37,800
[Music]

752
00:34:34,119 --> 00:34:39,960
no your sunflower comment brought up a

753
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:42,679
question that came up when I was at

754
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:45,480
Purdue at conference we had people

755
00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:47,240
saying that sunflowers do great no till

756
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:48,918
into rye and we had other people saying

757
00:34:47,239 --> 00:34:51,078
we plant Rye after sunflowers because we

758
00:34:48,918 --> 00:34:53,078
know it'll kill them so there won't be

759
00:34:51,079 --> 00:34:55,800
any volunteers what came out of it was

760
00:34:53,079 --> 00:34:57,920
that there were some varieties of

761
00:34:55,800 --> 00:35:00,119
sunflowers would work with certain

762
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:02,039
varieties of Ry been great and other

763
00:35:00,119 --> 00:35:03,160
varieties of sunflowers been killed by

764
00:35:02,039 --> 00:35:05,679
the

765
00:35:03,159 --> 00:35:08,920
r and it would be an interesting thing

766
00:35:05,679 --> 00:35:11,440
to assign to Matt or somebody in

767
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:13,119
your can we figure out which varieties

768
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:16,559
work with which varieties but I wonder

769
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:19,240
if that fits any of

770
00:35:16,559 --> 00:35:21,199
your it was just that one time we did

771
00:35:19,239 --> 00:35:23,679
that and that could very well be you

772
00:35:21,199 --> 00:35:26,039
know what it was

773
00:35:23,679 --> 00:35:27,759
um sounds like maybe we ought to try a

774
00:35:26,039 --> 00:35:29,838
little something again if nothing you

775
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:32,680
know other than just on an experimental

776
00:35:29,838 --> 00:35:36,000
basis because there is a lot of a lot of

777
00:35:32,679 --> 00:35:36,000
erosion in the in the

778
00:35:36,039 --> 00:35:40,559
sunflowers that's it's good to have CLA

779
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:42,440
asked questions because everybody

780
00:35:40,559 --> 00:35:44,920
thinking we may not find answers and I

781
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:48,200
think that's the whole or got lots of

782
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:50,960
questions but the answer may be fleing

783
00:35:48,199 --> 00:35:53,358
but we can can have ideas and the first

784
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:56,039
you look into things is to why things

785
00:35:53,358 --> 00:35:57,440
are you may find some something to pop

786
00:35:56,039 --> 00:35:59,480
up that you didn't even know that you

787
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:01,440
can

788
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:03,920
I'm going to throw another observation

789
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:05,720
out to you in that discussion we do

790
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:08,800
there was a researcher who had been

791
00:36:05,719 --> 00:36:11,719
noticing with wheat in the Carolinas

792
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:14,359
where they they'll double crop and plant

793
00:36:11,719 --> 00:36:16,679
soy beads after wheat and he was

794
00:36:14,358 --> 00:36:20,318
suddenly noticing that certain varieties

795
00:36:16,679 --> 00:36:22,480
of we of some of soybeans would yield 10

796
00:36:20,318 --> 00:36:24,920
to 20 bushel better after certain

797
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:27,280
varities of Queen he found an

798
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:29,200
interaction and he started looking at if

799
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:32,040
you're going to be double cropping after

800
00:36:29,199 --> 00:36:35,759
wheat which variety of wheat would work

801
00:36:32,039 --> 00:36:37,679
which variety of soybeans

802
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:39,319
afterwards and it was one of those

803
00:36:37,679 --> 00:36:41,279
things that never got followed up but I

804
00:36:39,318 --> 00:36:45,519
think be really useful in noil and it

805
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:47,720
may take out one variable that's causing

806
00:36:45,519 --> 00:36:50,318
problems yeah that's really cool I

807
00:36:47,719 --> 00:36:54,159
immedately think of animals too just

808
00:36:50,318 --> 00:36:56,358
because uh you have Ang a her and T

809
00:36:54,159 --> 00:36:58,118
doesn't mean they're all the same um eat

810
00:36:56,358 --> 00:36:59,779
every plant

811
00:36:58,119 --> 00:37:02,849
different characteristic and

812
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:02,849
[Music]

813
00:37:03,159 --> 00:37:07,199
personality I should say that about half

814
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:08,760
of our research a agenda in the

815
00:37:07,199 --> 00:37:10,118
sustainable cropping systems lab is

816
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:11,359
coming from from Claus and his

817
00:37:10,119 --> 00:37:13,838
suggestions about things that we should

818
00:37:11,358 --> 00:37:15,960
be doing so really appreciate uh the

819
00:37:13,838 --> 00:37:18,400
Martins and and all their contributions

820
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:20,280
um no but really interesting ideas here

821
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:23,559
other comments questions Emily in the

822
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:23,560
back thereal

823
00:37:39,318 --> 00:37:44,519
going yeah when I was when I was

824
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:49,358
talking you hear good and I were

825
00:37:47,679 --> 00:37:50,919
catching up before this and was like

826
00:37:49,358 --> 00:37:52,559
yeah Jay you traveled far enough away

827
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:55,079
from the par that you're considered an

828
00:37:52,559 --> 00:37:57,039
expert now I don't know about that but

829
00:37:55,079 --> 00:37:58,200
yeah back on the farm we're just such

830
00:37:57,039 --> 00:38:00,639
crazy

831
00:37:58,199 --> 00:38:03,879
um because what we do is so different

832
00:38:00,639 --> 00:38:08,199
but I do feel like I was connecting most

833
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:11,200
with some of our neighbors who no till

834
00:38:08,199 --> 00:38:12,719
uh with using chemicals but they were

835
00:38:11,199 --> 00:38:15,759
really excited to see what we were doing

836
00:38:12,719 --> 00:38:17,279
with the no till core into standing har

837
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:20,760
bch I that's something that they can do

838
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:23,359
too um so I feel like we were we were

839
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:26,520
bonding over

840
00:38:23,358 --> 00:38:28,838
that yeah yeah a question are you you

841
00:38:26,519 --> 00:38:31,039
doing any type of boot grade small

842
00:38:28,838 --> 00:38:32,639
grains or anything and how was the vet

843
00:38:31,039 --> 00:38:34,519
have you had any issues with vet and

844
00:38:32,639 --> 00:38:37,879
those

845
00:38:34,519 --> 00:38:40,838
volunteers why did you have to ask

846
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:43,880
that yeah uh yeah we we do grow a

847
00:38:40,838 --> 00:38:46,159
Paramount third grade wheat um and we

848
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:51,750
can't do that where we are experimenting

849
00:38:46,159 --> 00:38:54,358
with throwing no corn or really

850
00:38:51,750 --> 00:38:59,039
[Music]

851
00:38:54,358 --> 00:39:03,639
no down down our way they say grow V it

852
00:38:59,039 --> 00:39:03,639
gets attached to the it's always

853
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:12,880
there uh you guys

854
00:39:10,199 --> 00:39:15,519
experimented no taing your beans for

855
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:15,519
something more

856
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:19,760
than maybe double

857
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:27,079
15 we have the first year I referred to

858
00:39:23,039 --> 00:39:31,800
that non ver ride 30in beans and also

859
00:39:27,079 --> 00:39:35,920
drill be um the drilled be for the

860
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:37,800
cleanest out we got to draw that but

861
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:40,400
overall the biggest thing that we've

862
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:44,720
learned about organic is you got to have

863
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:47,800
plan A B C and sometimes the plan B and

864
00:39:44,719 --> 00:39:49,480
the 30in roads have allowed us to have

865
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:52,240
that and so that's kind of why we're

866
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:56,000
staying on we're staying on 30 in

867
00:39:52,239 --> 00:39:59,279
Road I know there's some folks near us

868
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:02,199
um and they're pushing like 250,000

869
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:06,920
population out no convention just so

870
00:40:02,199 --> 00:40:10,358
they don't have to come up going sh out

871
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:12,358
um so yeah the one one thing that we

872
00:40:10,358 --> 00:40:15,960
found too I mean in the not we have

873
00:40:12,358 --> 00:40:18,199
mayale on our area and and with the no

874
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:21,119
the covered crops tend to crowd that out

875
00:40:18,199 --> 00:40:21,118
so that may be

876
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:30,519
something yeah same my my experience is

877
00:40:27,559 --> 00:40:34,000
the same as we've got it on 30 in in

878
00:40:30,519 --> 00:40:38,440
with a 7 in crin drill um and then we

879
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:40,318
got into as well uh just uh tilling as

880
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:42,880
you know doing the same kind of seat bed

881
00:40:40,318 --> 00:40:46,239
prep with tillage and then planting

882
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:48,400
light like in mid June uh after the you

883
00:40:46,239 --> 00:40:50,879
know first summer flush of weeds come

884
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:54,400
and then just rotary hoing the soy beans

885
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:56,000
on S to control that actually worked out

886
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:58,119
pretty

887
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:00,099
well y

888
00:40:58,119 --> 00:41:02,760
a question for you J have

889
00:41:00,099 --> 00:41:06,719
[Music]

890
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:09,480
you running have you ever time we beans

891
00:41:06,719 --> 00:41:11,959
and how many times have you been over

892
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:16,440
control Leeds

893
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:19,920
in um okay yes uh we kind of need a lot

894
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:19,920
of beans come on mik

895
00:41:20,838 --> 00:41:26,078
up

896
00:41:22,358 --> 00:41:28,759
okay um okay maybe just put that thing

897
00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:30,960
down and project uh yeah we time we a

898
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:33,079
lot too it's basically comes down to

899
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:35,960
soil type if we've got you know really

900
00:41:33,079 --> 00:41:38,200
heavier soil we go rotary H because it

901
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:42,159
can it can crack open the soil a little

902
00:41:38,199 --> 00:41:46,399
bit more um and the time heer is great

903
00:41:42,159 --> 00:41:49,000
on lighter soil um depends on the skill

904
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:51,639
of the operator too anybody can rotary

905
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:54,358
ho I think but the time reader is really

906
00:41:51,639 --> 00:41:58,679
delicate with the settings um so will

907
00:41:54,358 --> 00:42:00,960
rotary h a lot like sometimes especially

908
00:41:58,679 --> 00:42:04,559
Fe

909
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:04,559
like times and

910
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:10,280
it all right well I think we're gonna

911
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:13,200
wrap it up there but Jay and Dean will

912
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:16,280
be here all day I think and um please

913
00:42:13,199 --> 00:42:16,279
feel free to follow up

914
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:26,960
so this has been a production of Cornell

915
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:26,960
University on the web at cornell.edu

916
00:42:27,358 --> 00:42:29,480
