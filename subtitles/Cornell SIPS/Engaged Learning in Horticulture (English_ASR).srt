1
00:00:01,159 --> 00:00:04,799
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:11,839
University engaged learning is a key

3
00:00:09,759 --> 00:00:14,919
component of our mission at Cornell

4
00:00:11,839 --> 00:00:17,439
University as we prepare students to be

5
00:00:14,919 --> 00:00:20,278
creative collaborative and critically

6
00:00:17,439 --> 00:00:23,079
reflective leaders we take that really

7
00:00:20,278 --> 00:00:26,439
seriously in horiculture where we engage

8
00:00:23,079 --> 00:00:29,439
students in three important ways we

9
00:00:26,439 --> 00:00:33,119
provide students with direct hands-on

10
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:35,558
experience es we also give students

11
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:37,759
chances to apply what they've learned in

12
00:00:35,558 --> 00:00:41,718
communities from the community of the

13
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:43,920
classroom to local and global settings

14
00:00:41,719 --> 00:00:46,480
and we provide students with

15
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:50,120
opportunities to reflect on their

16
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:52,679
learning to consider and articulate how

17
00:00:50,119 --> 00:00:55,159
they will use what they've learned to

18
00:00:52,679 --> 00:00:59,000
make the world a better place as they

19
00:00:55,159 --> 00:01:01,119
grow to become leaders in horiculture so

20
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,878
what does engage AG learning look like

21
00:01:01,119 --> 00:01:07,239
in horiculture let's look at some

22
00:01:03,878 --> 00:01:10,039
examples students in creating the urban

23
00:01:07,239 --> 00:01:13,079
Eden serve the Campus Community while

24
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:15,759
they learn they design and install

25
00:01:13,079 --> 00:01:19,000
landscape plantings as part of their

26
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:22,478
intensive study of more than 300 species

27
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:25,719

30
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:34,359
their work while walking across this

31
00:01:31,239 --> 00:01:37,199
beautiful campus in Horticultural

32
00:01:34,359 --> 00:01:39,959

33
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:43,000
many Hands-On activities from planting

34
00:01:39,959 --> 00:01:46,158
trees to harvesting Peppers to donating

the field is not separate from their

49
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:29,400
classroom experience rather it builds on

50
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:32,280
it Agricultural Science majors and many

changed them viticulture and enology

learning and exercise exercises and

74
00:03:30,519 --> 00:03:35,759
writing encourages students to reflect

75
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:39,360
on the impact of Nature and Gardens on

76
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:41,759
their well-being we create public art

77
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:45,000
which may range from a sad sofa on

78
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:47,598
campus to special installations such as

79
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,479

94
00:04:21,478 --> 00:04:27,279
horiculture instills non- Majors with a

95
00:04:24,478 --> 00:04:29,918
lifelong appreciation for plants and

96
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:33,239
teaches them basic Horticultural skills

97
00:04:29,918 --> 00:04:35,799
s they apply techniques such as pruning

98
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:38,720
to campus Landscapes and fruit trees at

99
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:40,879
the Cornell Orchards and students in a

00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:43,400
freshman seminar have gotten their hands

101
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:46,360
dirty partnering with Habitat for

Humanity to see Lawns for low income

103
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:51,520

104
00:04:49,038 --> 00:04:55,879
University and the communities in which

105
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:58,120
our students work extend far beyond Etha

106
00:04:55,879 --> 00:05:00,519
in my course experiential garden-based

107
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:02,800
learning and bise the students spend

108
00:05:00,519 --> 00:05:05,839
their entire spring break creating

109
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:08,680
School Gardens and teaching lessons that

110
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:12,198
tie the garden to the curriculum in

111
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:16,000
southern bise so by focusing on those

112
00:05:12,199 --> 00:05:19,360
three things direct experience

113
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:22,240
reflection and Community engagement

114
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:25,199
we're preparing our students to become

115
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:30,079
leaders in their field in their

116
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:30,080
communities and all around the world
