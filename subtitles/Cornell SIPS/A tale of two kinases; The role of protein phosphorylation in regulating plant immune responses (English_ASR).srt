1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,760
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:10,599
University mention what my lab is

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:13,400
interested in is the interaction between

4
00:00:10,599 --> 00:00:14,879
bacterial pathogens and plants and today

5
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:17,600
I'm going to talk about two different

6
00:00:14,878 --> 00:00:20,559
projects in the lab one is focused on

7
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:23,519
the role of plant kinases in regulating

8
00:00:20,559 --> 00:00:26,759
plant immune responses and the second um

9
00:00:23,518 --> 00:00:28,959
is work on bacterial canker of tomato uh

10
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:31,080
disease that's caused by Asylum limiting

11
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,759
uh bacterium and some our work

12
00:00:31,079 --> 00:00:34,640
understanding what regulates bacterial

13
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:37,679
virulence in that

14
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:40,239
system so um plants have a variety of

15
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:42,558
different associations um with

16
00:00:40,238 --> 00:00:44,159
microorganisms uh in nature and also in

17
00:00:42,558 --> 00:00:46,718
agriculture and this significantly

18
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:49,479
shapes plant health and productivity uh

19
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:51,239
in these Landscapes and so uh I'm sure

20
00:00:49,479 --> 00:00:52,558
we're all aware that there are positive

21
00:00:51,238 --> 00:00:55,119
associations between different

22
00:00:52,558 --> 00:00:57,718
microorganisms and plants like that of

23
00:00:55,119 --> 00:01:00,038
nitrogen fixing bacteria um or micro

24
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:02,760
risal fungi that enable nutrient acqu

25
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:04,519
position but what we're interested in uh

26
00:01:02,759 --> 00:01:06,840
in my group are these negative

27
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:09,200
associations um or pathogens that can

28
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:11,920
infect plants and decrease uh crop

29
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:15,040
yields and so we work on some Leaf uh

30
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:16,799
Leaf pathogens like pseudomona singi and

31
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:20,240
we are also working on vascular

32
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:22,000
pathogens that can infect um uh tomato

33
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:24,399
uh as well as

34
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,959
citrus and one of the reasons why I

35
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:29,359
became interested um as a a younger

36
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:31,438
scientist in Plant Pathology and decided

37
00:01:29,359 --> 00:01:33,399
to pursue that was because plant

38
00:01:31,438 --> 00:01:35,959
pathogens can really significantly

39
00:01:33,399 --> 00:01:38,478
impact agricultural production and in

40
00:01:35,959 --> 00:01:42,039
addition uh there's always a lot of very

41
00:01:38,478 --> 00:01:44,118
interesting plant diseases um that are

42
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:46,600
are continuously emerging as well as

43
00:01:44,118 --> 00:01:49,519
really important longstanding diseases

44
00:01:46,599 --> 00:01:52,798
so I've just Illustrated a few here um

45
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:54,759
so Banana uh is particularly problematic

46
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:56,479
uh for plant disease and it's currently

47
00:01:54,759 --> 00:01:58,879
being affected by a number of different

48
00:01:56,478 --> 00:02:00,000
fungal pathogens including microser

49
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:02,158
fijiensis

50
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,599
and this is because all banana uh that

51
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:06,280
we eat is clonally propagated and

52
00:02:04,599 --> 00:02:08,758
derived from a single clone called

53
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:10,759
cendes so that makes breeding for

54
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:12,519
resistance uh very difficult because

55
00:02:10,758 --> 00:02:15,039
there's no genetic diversity there to

56
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:16,800
draw from uh and so because of that

57
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:19,000
there's lots of fungicide sprays that

58
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,360
are sprayed aerially over uh banana

59
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,318
plantations multiple times even within a

60
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:26,280
week uh in a growing season uh another

61
00:02:24,318 --> 00:02:29,039
really important disease is Citrus

62
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:31,159
Greening or Juan long Bing uh this is a

63
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:34,359
long-standing disease but it's emerged

64
00:02:31,159 --> 00:02:37,199
recently within the United States um

65
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:39,239
it's severely impacted Citrus production

66
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:41,318
in Florida there's been about5 billion

67
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:42,840
dollars worth of loss in the last um

68
00:02:41,318 --> 00:02:44,679
five or six years and it's thought that

69
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:48,439
almost all trees in Florida are now

70
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:50,360
infected uh it's transmitted by a sid uh

71
00:02:48,439 --> 00:02:52,919
and it's very hard to control a flying

72
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:55,400
insect um and we now know that the

73
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:58,119
disease is present in Texas the SIDS

74
00:02:55,400 --> 00:03:01,039
established in California um and there

75
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:02,879
are um disease trees within the Los

76
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:05,280
Angeles area and now we know that that's

77
00:03:02,878 --> 00:03:08,560
spreading within the LA County area of

78
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:10,719
California um and uh uh so this is an

79
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,959
important uh emerging disease within the

80
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:15,400
US um there are also long-standing

81
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:18,120
diseases that still retain importance

82
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:21,439
like late blight of potato and tomato uh

83
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:24,039
caused by the OM phyto feses and here

84
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:25,719
you can see the um importance of genetic

85
00:03:24,039 --> 00:03:27,878
resistance where you have one row of

86
00:03:25,719 --> 00:03:30,080
potato uh that possesses an immune

87
00:03:27,878 --> 00:03:32,840
receptor that can recognize the pathogen

88
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:34,719
and another row that uh lacks the

89
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:36,959
corresponding immune receptor and is

90
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:39,400
decimated by the disease so genetic

91
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:41,519
resistance can be quite robust the issue

92
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:43,879
is is that some immune receptors can be

93
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:45,879
rapidly overcome uh by the pathogen

94
00:03:43,878 --> 00:03:47,639
population and then there's also been

95
00:03:45,878 --> 00:03:49,399
quite a bit of basic research on plant

96
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:52,039
microb interactions that have really

97
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:54,680
significantly enhanced our understanding

98
00:03:52,039 --> 00:03:57,679
um of genome engineering and editing in

99
00:03:54,680 --> 00:04:00,959
Plants also hormone perception and um

100
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:03,480
receptor perception as well

101
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:06,598
so we work on the plant andate immune

102
00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:09,318
system so plants don't actually have um

103
00:04:06,598 --> 00:04:11,000
uh adaptive immunity like you and I do

104
00:04:09,318 --> 00:04:13,238
they don't have specialized immune cells

105
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,799
that can circulate but what they do have

106
00:04:13,239 --> 00:04:17,918
is a large number of germline encoded

107
00:04:15,799 --> 00:04:21,439
receptors that can specifically

108
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:23,680
recognize all classes of pathogens so

109
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:25,478
there are receptors that are present on

110
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,879
the cell surface called pattern

111
00:04:25,478 --> 00:04:30,240
recognition receptors that can

112
00:04:27,879 --> 00:04:33,319
specifically recognize conserved

113
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:35,600
microbial features called pamps or Ms

114
00:04:33,319 --> 00:04:38,639
examples of this would be uh bacterial

115
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:41,199
fuelin or fungal kiten um and these

116
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:44,918
surface localized receptors recognize

117
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:47,080
these microbial signatures as nonself uh

118
00:04:44,918 --> 00:04:50,399
commonly function in conjunction with a

119
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:52,439
co- uh receptor and then elicit pattern

120
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:56,439
triggered immune responses uh and

121
00:04:52,439 --> 00:04:59,839
resistance so um uh pathogens need to be

122
00:04:56,439 --> 00:05:01,478
able to be adapted to inhibit uh plant

123
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:03,918
immune responses if they want to be able

124
00:05:01,478 --> 00:05:06,719
to cause disease and one way that

125
00:05:03,918 --> 00:05:09,799
pathogens can do this is by delivery of

126
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:13,400
pathogen proteins called affectors into

127
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:15,478
plant cells and these affectors um uh or

128
00:05:13,399 --> 00:05:17,198
characterized affectors can disrupt

129
00:05:15,478 --> 00:05:19,519
plant immune signaling they can Target

130
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:22,280
The receptors themselves or Downstream

131
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:25,240
immune signaling components um and these

132
00:05:22,279 --> 00:05:27,519
affectors can still be recognized um in

133
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:30,120
certain plant genotypes by the presence

134
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:33,560
of plant resistance genes um I'll call

135
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:36,439
them nlrs but basically resistance Gene

136
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:38,160
and nlr can be interchangeable um

137
00:05:36,439 --> 00:05:40,639
they're called nlrs because they have a

138
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:43,319
nucleotide binding site and C terminal

139
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:45,120
Lucine Rich repeats and these nlrs can

140
00:05:43,319 --> 00:05:47,400
recognize the presence of pathogen

141
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:49,120
affectors trigger robust defense

142
00:05:47,399 --> 00:05:51,799
responses and affector triggered

143
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:53,160
immunity and uh historically it was

144
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:55,600
thought that these are two distinct

145
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:57,120
branches of plant immune signaling but

146
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,720
now we know that it's kind of more of a

147
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:01,360
complicated web uh and there are sign

148
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:04,840
ific overlap in immune signaling

149
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:07,439
networks between PTI and

150
00:06:04,839 --> 00:06:09,679
ETI and then plants also have large

151
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:11,879
arsenals of immune receptors so if you

152
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:14,959
look in uh plant genomes and you're just

153
00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:17,240
looking at these um R proteins or nlrs

154
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:19,560
that can recognize uh intracellular

155
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:22,759
effectors they range on the low end of

156
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:26,478
about 54 in papaya um to the high end of

157
00:06:22,759 --> 00:06:28,759
around a th and domesticated Apple um

158
00:06:26,478 --> 00:06:31,279
and the repertoire differs significantly

159
00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:34,160
even among different genotypes of a

160
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:36,159
particular plant uh there's also large

161
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:38,560
numbers of receptor like kinases or

162
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:40,240
receptor like proteins these do control

163
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:42,360
a range of processes but at least a

164
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:44,439
subset are going to be involved in

165
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:46,560
pathogen perception and in the model

166
00:06:44,439 --> 00:06:48,279
plant to rabit opsis there are 600 of

167
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:50,478
these um and the number is just

168
00:06:48,279 --> 00:06:53,239
increasing for nlrs as well with the

169
00:06:50,478 --> 00:06:55,800
Advent of AR Ren seek uh to identify

170
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:58,759
more nlr receptors and

171
00:06:55,800 --> 00:07:01,400
plants so in my lab we work on three

172
00:06:58,759 --> 00:07:03,919
different p pathogens um and I'll talk

173
00:07:01,399 --> 00:07:06,598
about two of them today

174
00:07:03,918 --> 00:07:09,839
uh one disease that we work on is called

175
00:07:06,598 --> 00:07:11,839
bacterial Speck um it's caused by Pamona

176
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:14,719
sinki path of Our tomato and it can

177
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:16,638
infect both tomato and a rabbit opsis

178
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,599
and cause these necrotic specs during

179
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:21,319
later stages of disease and that's where

180
00:07:18,598 --> 00:07:23,598
the disease got its name we're primarily

181
00:07:21,319 --> 00:07:26,319
um I'll Focus today on our work with

182
00:07:23,598 --> 00:07:29,199
pseudomona singi and a rabid opsis uh

183
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:31,598
the other uh pathogen that we work on is

184
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:33,800
clav actor Michigan ensus and this

185
00:07:31,598 --> 00:07:36,439
causes bacterial canker of tomato you

186
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:38,280
can see some of the symptoms here um

187
00:07:36,439 --> 00:07:40,478
it's called canker because during later

188
00:07:38,279 --> 00:07:42,679
stages of disease uh the bacteria will

189
00:07:40,478 --> 00:07:44,719
induce the stem to split open and this

190
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:46,400
is caused called a canker where then

191
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:48,960
bacteria can ooze out and serve as a

192
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:50,878
secondary source of inoculant uh and if

193
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:52,799
there's a lot of bacteria around during

194
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:55,400
um flowering you can get fruit symptoms

195
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:57,360
as well and so here we're interested in

196
00:07:55,399 --> 00:07:59,799
we've performed some genome sequencing

197
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:02,840
of a variety of different clava Michigan

198
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:05,120
Andis isolates and use that for um diag

199
00:08:02,839 --> 00:08:07,519
diagnostic testing as well as to gain

200
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:10,079
insight into conserved viance mechanisms

201
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:11,959
present in caor and then I won't talk

202
00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:13,800
about this project but I'd be happy to

203
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:15,758
talk with anyone afterwards uh we're

204
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:18,280
also working on Citrus Greening or Juan

205
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:20,800
Lang Bing um here we're primarily

206
00:08:18,279 --> 00:08:22,758
interested in investigating the role of

207
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:25,158
secreted bacterial proteins called

208
00:08:22,759 --> 00:08:27,038
affectors and what their plant targets

209
00:08:25,158 --> 00:08:29,759
uh are during

210
00:08:27,038 --> 00:08:32,399
infection so first I'll talk about PUD

211
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:35,240
singi and our work with the Rabbid opsis

212
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:37,278
and uh if you look at camonis singi um

213
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:39,240
it can be divided into different pathar

214
00:08:37,278 --> 00:08:41,679
and each path ofar can cause a distinct

215
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:43,680
disease uh and pseudomonads in general

216
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:45,879
are pretty good epifit so if you go out

217
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:48,719
and surf uh sample the surface of a

218
00:08:45,879 --> 00:08:50,879
plant leaf you'll see that pseudomonads

219
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:53,720
are a core component of the phosphere

220
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:55,519
microbiome but pathogenic pseudomonads

221
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:58,278
need to gain entry into the plant

222
00:08:55,519 --> 00:09:00,480
interior in order to cause disease and

223
00:08:58,278 --> 00:09:02,838
they can do this by swimming through

224
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:06,039
open stamata or wounds where then they

225
00:09:02,839 --> 00:09:08,160
multiply in the apoplast or the space

226
00:09:06,039 --> 00:09:09,958
between mesophile cells and if it's a

227
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:11,879
susceptible genotype that lacks

228
00:09:09,958 --> 00:09:14,039
corresponding immune receptors you can

229
00:09:11,879 --> 00:09:16,240
get quite High bacterial titer and then

230
00:09:14,039 --> 00:09:18,838
visible uh disease

231
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:22,320
symptoms so first I want to talk about

232
00:09:18,839 --> 00:09:24,760
our our work focusing on how uh these

233
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,600
intracellular uh nlr immune receptors

234
00:09:24,759 --> 00:09:28,799
are

235
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:31,040
activated so these nlr receptors have a

236
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:33,599
conserved domain architecture they would

237
00:09:31,039 --> 00:09:36,240
have either a coil coil or tier domain

238
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:39,600
at their end Terminus uh a nucleotide

239
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:42,959
binding site that could bind and hydy um

240
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:45,519
ATP and C terminal Lucine Rich repeats

241
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:47,919
and it's hypothesized at a resting state

242
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:51,159
the receptor is tightly bound and it's

243
00:09:47,919 --> 00:09:53,199
bound to ADP and so uh if a receptor

244
00:09:51,159 --> 00:09:56,559
directly recognizes an affector in their

245
00:09:53,200 --> 00:10:00,360
cases of this uh what happens is um you

246
00:09:56,559 --> 00:10:03,278
get exchange of ADP for ATP um this is a

247
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:05,720
switch for the active bound uh form of

248
00:10:03,278 --> 00:10:08,039
the receptor so now it's on an on State

249
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:10,759
and can signal Downstream can also get

250
00:10:08,039 --> 00:10:14,480
ATP hydrolysis to potentially recycle it

251
00:10:10,759 --> 00:10:17,240
back uh to an inactive state in indirect

252
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:19,920
recognition the model is similar except

253
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:24,680
the affector is not directly recognized

254
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:26,479
rather the uh nlr guards a host Protein

255
00:10:24,679 --> 00:10:28,399
that's targeted by the affector or a

256
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:32,240
mimic of a host Protein that's targeted

257
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:34,120
by the affector um and when the affector

258
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:36,159
targets and modifies this guarded

259
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:38,159
protein this acts as a switch for

260
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:40,879
receptor

261
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:43,199
activation and other outputs of affector

262
00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:46,320
triggered immune responses in Plants um

263
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:48,839
are kind of shown here uh and outputs of

264
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:50,720
ETI are really if you're looking at uh

265
00:10:48,839 --> 00:10:53,079
resistance or susceptibility it's more

266
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:55,278
of a quantitative phenotype than a

267
00:10:53,078 --> 00:10:57,359
qualitative phenotype so you can see

268
00:10:55,278 --> 00:11:00,838
here these are tobacco plants that have

269
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:03,399
the enge that recognizes um the portion

270
00:11:00,839 --> 00:11:05,519
of the tobacco mosaic virus and you can

271
00:11:03,399 --> 00:11:07,679
see these resistant uh tobacco plants

272
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:09,839
there's basically no um viral

273
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:11,120
proliferation but compared to

274
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:13,279
susceptible plants where you're looking

275
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:15,560
at gfp this is the presence of the virus

276
00:11:13,278 --> 00:11:19,078
there uh similarly in bacterial

277
00:11:15,559 --> 00:11:22,599
infection this uh arabidopsis line has

278
00:11:19,078 --> 00:11:25,319
the rpm1 resistance uh nlr uh you

279
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:27,040
basically see no symptoms after uh

280
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:30,278
inoculation whereas susceptible

281
00:11:27,039 --> 00:11:33,078
genotypes um look uh very diseased and

282
00:11:30,278 --> 00:11:34,958
at the at the cellular level a common

283
00:11:33,078 --> 00:11:37,278
Hallmark of effector triggered immune

284
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:39,638
responses is programed cell death at the

285
00:11:37,278 --> 00:11:41,078
sight of infection so this plant if you

286
00:11:39,639 --> 00:11:43,600
look under the microscope will have

287
00:11:41,078 --> 00:11:45,359
patches of programed cell death um and

288
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:47,720
what we can do in the laboratory is go

289
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:49,759
in with a higher dose of pathogen and

290
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:51,240
then you can see macroscopic cell death

291
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:55,039
symptoms as

292
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:58,440
well so work in my lab has focused on uh

293
00:11:55,039 --> 00:12:00,919
one key plant protein called ren4 ren4

294
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:03,680
is conserved across land plants and it's

295
00:12:00,919 --> 00:12:07,120
been shown to be important for mediating

296
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:11,000
immune responses in lettuce tomato

297
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:12,919
soybean uh and also a rabid opsis and so

298
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,039
uh what we know about rin4 and a rabid

299
00:12:12,919 --> 00:12:17,399
opsis from work in my lab and Brian

300
00:12:15,039 --> 00:12:20,919
stt's lab also Jeff dangle lab and Dave

301
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:24,000
Mackey's lab is that uh it can associate

302
00:12:20,919 --> 00:12:26,360
with several immune receptors and it's

303
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:30,000
also targeted by a number of different

304
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:34,399
bacterial effectors so uh at a ing State

305
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:37,559
rfor can associate um with the nlr rpm1

306
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:39,919
and rps2 holds it in an inactive State

307
00:12:37,559 --> 00:12:43,879
um to suppress effector triggered immune

308
00:12:39,919 --> 00:12:47,159
responses um but upon um delivery of the

309
00:12:43,879 --> 00:12:49,679
bacterial effector avrb Rin for gets

310
00:12:47,159 --> 00:12:52,120
phosphorated and Rin for phosphorilation

311
00:12:49,679 --> 00:12:54,479
was hypothesized to be a trigger to

312
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:56,159
activate the rpm1 receptor leading to

313
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:58,959
effector triggered immunity so this is

314
00:12:56,159 --> 00:13:00,719
an example of indirect recognition um

315
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:02,479
now we tried and several other

316
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:04,399
Laboratories tried quite hard to see if

317
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:06,680
avrb was a kise that would be the most

318
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:09,720
simple explanation uh but we were never

319
00:13:06,679 --> 00:13:11,239
able to detect kise activity for avrb so

320
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:14,800
we thought there had to be another hose

321
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:17,440
kyes that might uh be playing a role and

322
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:20,159
what we did is we used Mass spectrometry

323
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:23,720
uh and imuno precipitation to pull down

324
00:13:20,159 --> 00:13:26,919
the rin4 and rpm1 complex upon um

325
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:29,360
activation uh and upon delivery of avrb

326
00:13:26,919 --> 00:13:32,159
and what we found uh is a kise called

327
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:35,199
Rip K and rip K is a receptor like

328
00:13:32,159 --> 00:13:38,399
cytoplasmic kise um and we could show in

329
00:13:35,198 --> 00:13:40,679
vitro that rip K can phosphorate Ren for

330
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:45,399
at three sites uh and we map those sites

331
00:13:40,679 --> 00:13:48,919
by mass spectrometry 3 21 Serene 160 and

332
00:13:45,399 --> 00:13:51,839
3166 and 321 and uh

333
00:13:48,919 --> 00:13:54,078
3166 uh were conserved across rin4

334
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:56,639
homologues and land

335
00:13:54,078 --> 00:13:59,120
plants and we had some evidence to

336
00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:00,759
indicate that 3 166 would be a critical

337
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:03,959
region based on where it was within the

338
00:14:00,759 --> 00:14:06,320
rin4 protein so we generated a phosphos

339
00:14:03,958 --> 00:14:09,638
specific antibody that would recognize

340
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:11,278
phosphorilation of 3 166 and we can show

341
00:14:09,639 --> 00:14:14,399
that during natural infection with

342
00:14:11,278 --> 00:14:17,559
pomonis expressing avrb you get Rin for

343
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:19,759
phosphorilation at 31 166 total levels

344
00:14:17,559 --> 00:14:21,518
of R for at this time Point don't change

345
00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:24,039
and the bacterial effector is also

346
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:27,720
expressed and delivered uh then we used

347
00:14:24,039 --> 00:14:29,078
a genetic approach to um uh determine

348
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:31,680
the importance of Ren for

349
00:14:29,078 --> 00:14:34,120
phosphorilation for Activation of rpm1

350
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:36,039
so we changed these phosph phosphorated

351
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:39,440
residues and mimicked phosphorilation by

352
00:14:36,039 --> 00:14:42,039
changing them to um aspartic acid and

353
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:44,399
then uh if we looked at the resulting uh

354
00:14:42,039 --> 00:14:46,439
lines when we tried to complement rin4

355
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:49,000
if we mimic rfor phosphorilation you see

356
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:51,440
the plants are small dwarf they're

357
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,360
lesion mimic so this is a Hallmark for

358
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:56,320
constitutive activation of immune

359
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:59,039
responses um whereas if uh we cross

360
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:00,800
these lines into a genotype that did no

361
00:14:59,039 --> 00:15:02,159
no longer possess the rpm1 immune

362
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:03,439
receptor these plants looked

363
00:15:02,159 --> 00:15:06,559
phenotypically

364
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:09,360
normal and then um using transient

365
00:15:06,559 --> 00:15:11,838
expression in N kosana we also um

366
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:14,360
determined what the critical residue was

367
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:18,079
uh that's required for uh recognition by

368
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:20,278
rpm1 and so here if we coexpress rpm1

369
00:15:18,078 --> 00:15:21,758
with various versions of Ren 4 we can

370
00:15:20,278 --> 00:15:26,000
see that coexpressing with a

371
00:15:21,759 --> 00:15:27,919
phosphomimic of 3in 166 induces uh this

372
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,440
macroscopic hypersensitive response

373
00:15:27,919 --> 00:15:31,240
which is a Hallmark of a factor

374
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:33,800
triggered

375
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:36,039
responses and then uh if you look at Ren

376
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:38,919
4 it doesn't look like it's an enzyme of

377
00:15:36,039 --> 00:15:41,120
any kind uh although it's conserved um

378
00:15:38,919 --> 00:15:45,278
and it has a high predicted level of

379
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:47,078
intrinsic Disorder so um we tested the

380
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:50,000
hypothesis that potentially

381
00:15:47,078 --> 00:15:52,159
phosphorilation might change uh uh uh

382
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,360
secondary structure or some aspect of

383
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:56,480
flexibility we didn't see any change in

384
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:59,360
Gross secondary structure and what we

385
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:01,560
did is we what we we phosphorated for in

386
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:05,519
the presence of rip K using recombinant

387
00:16:01,559 --> 00:16:08,159
proteins um then got rid of uh rip K uh

388
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:10,480
using centrifugation and then subjected

389
00:16:08,159 --> 00:16:13,318
either phosphorated here or un

390
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:15,600
phosphorated Rin 4 to CD spectroscopy

391
00:16:13,318 --> 00:16:18,639
and you can see here for wild type rin4

392
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:21,440
you get a peak uh at low wavelength and

393
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:23,440
that's cons consistent with this being

394
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:26,920
uh uh intrinsically disordered or random

395
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:29,160
coil protein uh and it you see a

396
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:31,159
stronger negative elasy uh in the

397
00:16:29,159 --> 00:16:32,799
presence of phosphorilated Rin

398
00:16:31,159 --> 00:16:35,278
indicating that it's a more flexible

399
00:16:32,799 --> 00:16:38,559
protein see similar things if we're

400
00:16:35,278 --> 00:16:42,240
looking at wow type rin4 or a foso uh

401
00:16:38,559 --> 00:16:45,159
mytic mutant here by CD spectroscopy

402
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:46,600
um and then we also searched for

403
00:16:45,159 --> 00:16:50,159
potentially other players that could

404
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:51,920
play a role in early recognition of rpm1

405
00:16:50,159 --> 00:16:54,198
and this is a collaboration between my

406
00:16:51,919 --> 00:16:56,240
group uh and Jim s group at Chinese

407
00:16:54,198 --> 00:16:59,278
Academy of Sciences and what they

408
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:01,879
identified was a point mutation in a

409
00:16:59,278 --> 00:17:04,720
cyclophilin uh that had enhanced

410
00:17:01,879 --> 00:17:07,480
enzymatic activity uh but compromised

411
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:10,640
rpm1 mediated recognition so

412
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:14,038
cyclophilins are cyrans isomerases uh

413
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:15,880
and they catalyze this uh for pepal pral

414
00:17:14,038 --> 00:17:18,798
bonds and this is a rate limiting step

415
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:21,520
during protein folding and if we looked

416
00:17:18,798 --> 00:17:24,519
at this particular point mutation uh

417
00:17:21,519 --> 00:17:27,439
within Rock one and we perform disease

418
00:17:24,519 --> 00:17:29,599
assays using virulent bacteria here on

419
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:33,919
the y axis you can see

420
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:36,038
bacterial growth um on a log scale and

421
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:37,640
then this is days post inoculation you

422
00:17:36,038 --> 00:17:40,640
can see there's not a difference between

423
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:43,880
wild type Colombia and The Rock one

424
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:47,440
point mutation or any null mutations

425
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:51,000
within uh uh nlr immune receptors but if

426
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:54,320
we look we could see a specific effect

427
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:56,679
uh after uh activation of rpm1 in

428
00:17:54,319 --> 00:17:59,439
resistant plants uh and so what you can

429
00:17:56,679 --> 00:18:01,440
see here is that Colombia can can

430
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:04,400
recognize avrb through the presence of

431
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:07,038
rpm1 so has much lower bacterial growth

432
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:09,960
than here um and then the rock one point

433
00:18:07,038 --> 00:18:12,599
mutation was compromised in rpm1

434
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:13,840
recognition this here is the rpm1 uh

435
00:18:12,599 --> 00:18:16,519
null

436
00:18:13,839 --> 00:18:19,879
mutant and then we did some mapping of

437
00:18:16,519 --> 00:18:23,720
the importance of uh Proline residues

438
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:25,840
across Ren 4 for activating rpm1 um and

439
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:27,360
mutated every single Proline residue and

440
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:28,959
first the graduate student that was

441
00:18:27,359 --> 00:18:30,399
doing it I said don't don't do that

442
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:31,759
because that's going to grossly mess up

443
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,759
the the structure and you're going to

444
00:18:31,759 --> 00:18:35,879
get a lot of uh results that aren't

445
00:18:33,759 --> 00:18:38,079
going to be easy to interpret but I was

446
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:40,679
wrong because there was only one mutant

447
00:18:38,079 --> 00:18:43,359
uh that uh gave a phenotype and that was

448
00:18:40,679 --> 00:18:44,919
proline at position 149 so sometimes

449
00:18:43,359 --> 00:18:47,158
it's good the students don't listen to

450
00:18:44,919 --> 00:18:49,440
you and just go and do the

451
00:18:47,159 --> 00:18:51,400
experiment so here what we've done is

452
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:54,320
we've taken a peptide of ren4

453
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:57,038
surrounding pein 149 labeled it and then

454
00:18:54,319 --> 00:18:58,319
subjected that to NMR spectroscopy and

455
00:18:57,038 --> 00:18:59,279
we can see that this is the general

456
00:18:58,319 --> 00:19:01,599
structure

457
00:18:59,279 --> 00:19:03,759
and then if we add in unlabeled Rock one

458
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:05,599
you're still only looking at Ren 4 what

459
00:19:03,759 --> 00:19:08,839
we can see is specific

460
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:11,879
isomerization um here and here uh

461
00:19:08,839 --> 00:19:14,359
surrounding Proline 149 so that

462
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:17,720
indicates that in vro uh Rock one can

463
00:19:14,359 --> 00:19:19,639
isomerize Ren for at position uh 149 and

464
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:22,480
then we tested to see what's the effect

465
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:24,840
of this uh on the ability to induce Rin

466
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:28,279
for phosphorilation so first if we look

467
00:19:24,839 --> 00:19:30,879
in Plants uh at this rock one point

468
00:19:28,279 --> 00:19:33,879
mutation that has higher isomerization

469
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:37,280
capability uh that uh after delivery of

470
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:40,480
avrb we see much lower ability to induce

471
00:19:37,279 --> 00:19:43,319
rin4 phosphorilation and if we delete uh

472
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:45,759
Proline 149 from Ren 4 we can see that

473
00:19:43,319 --> 00:19:49,399
at a basil level you much you have much

474
00:19:45,759 --> 00:19:52,400
higher basil phosphorilation uh of Ren

475
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:54,960
4 so this is our current model of rpm1

476
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:57,480
activation we know that rpm1 is at the

477
00:19:54,960 --> 00:20:00,558
membrane um it can associate at a

478
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:03,599
resting state with rip K Rin 4 and rock

479
00:20:00,558 --> 00:20:07,119
one and ren 4 is isomerized by Rock one

480
00:20:03,599 --> 00:20:08,399
we predict at a resting state upon

481
00:20:07,119 --> 00:20:13,319
delivery of

482
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:15,559
avrb um avrb can dimerize with um rip K

483
00:20:13,319 --> 00:20:18,759
Rock one disassociates

484
00:20:15,558 --> 00:20:22,918
rin4 is now in a Cy confirmation at its

485
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:25,599
pran 149 residue this uh enables

486
00:20:22,919 --> 00:20:27,880
stronger phosphorilation uh via rip K

487
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:30,519
and then subsequently we know that rip K

488
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:33,159
and avrb disassociate from the complex

489
00:20:30,519 --> 00:20:36,639
but rin4 and rpm1 stay at the membrane

490
00:20:33,159 --> 00:20:40,280
and you get activation of rpm1 uh and

491
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:42,559
induction of Defense responses so um

492
00:20:40,279 --> 00:20:44,480
this association with rock one enforces

493
00:20:42,558 --> 00:20:46,839
the inactive State prior to recognition

494
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:48,880
because you want really close control

495
00:20:46,839 --> 00:20:50,839
over uh activation of plant immune

496
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:53,320
responses because there's a energetic

497
00:20:50,839 --> 00:20:54,720
cost to inducing immunity and enforces

498
00:20:53,319 --> 00:20:56,558
actually the active state after

499
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:59,679
recognition so you get robust immune

500
00:20:56,558 --> 00:21:01,759
responses there and and we've also done

501
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:04,159
some work to try to figure out why

502
00:21:01,759 --> 00:21:09,119
affectors would actually Target rin4 in

503
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:11,039
the absence um uh uh of rpm1 so I

504
00:21:09,119 --> 00:21:13,439
mentioned that there's a large number of

505
00:21:11,038 --> 00:21:16,720
nlr immune receptors that are present in

506
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:18,400
plant genomes but um the nlr complement

507
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:21,400
can vary significantly depending on the

508
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:24,600
plant genotype so our hypothesis was

509
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:26,440
that in the absence of rpm1 ren4

510
00:21:24,599 --> 00:21:28,639
phosphorilation would enhance bacterial

511
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:30,038
virulence and this would be maybe one

512
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:31,799
reason why multiple effectors would

513
00:21:30,038 --> 00:21:34,519
Target RN 4 because it's not going to be

514
00:21:31,798 --> 00:21:37,759
beneficial to them if it's inducing

515
00:21:34,519 --> 00:21:41,558
immunity uh and so we able to show that

516
00:21:37,759 --> 00:21:44,200
uh rinor mediated phosphorilation inside

517
00:21:41,558 --> 00:21:45,839
mesil cells suppresses pattern triggered

518
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:48,558
immune responses so you get lower

519
00:21:45,839 --> 00:21:50,798
extracellular Ros burst um altered M

520
00:21:48,558 --> 00:21:53,480
kyes kinetics and increased growth of

521
00:21:50,798 --> 00:21:55,798
non-adapted pathogens uh we were also

522
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:58,159
able to show a number of years ago on

523
00:21:55,798 --> 00:22:00,200
this PL biology paper that Ren for can

524
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:05,080
associ with a plasma membrane pump

525
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:07,360
called aha um and uh what we found was

526
00:22:05,079 --> 00:22:10,038
is that phosphorated Rin could more

527
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:12,918
strongly associate with Aha and induces

528
00:22:10,038 --> 00:22:15,079
enhanced um uh activity and if you look

529
00:22:12,919 --> 00:22:17,520
at plants that are phosph mimics for

530
00:22:15,079 --> 00:22:19,879
ren4 what we see is that they have wider

531
00:22:17,519 --> 00:22:23,278
basil stodal apertures and we also know

532
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:25,640
that avrb when you inoculate ponus

533
00:22:23,278 --> 00:22:28,038
stringy expressing avrb it can also

534
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:30,080
manipulate stodel apertures uh upon

535
00:22:28,038 --> 00:22:31,960
surfaces

536
00:22:30,079 --> 00:22:34,000
inoculation so now I want to switch

537
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:36,240
gears and talk about another kinas that

538
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:40,319
we've been working on uh and this is pbl

539
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:42,400
13 and uh pbl 13 and rip K are closely

540
00:22:40,319 --> 00:22:45,839
related they're both members of these

541
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:49,559
receptor like cytoplasmic kineses so uh

542
00:22:45,839 --> 00:22:51,798
here is just a um a diagram of the

543
00:22:49,558 --> 00:22:54,359
receptor likee kinases and you can see

544
00:22:51,798 --> 00:22:56,519
these receptor like cytoplasmic kinases

545
00:22:54,359 --> 00:23:00,000
uh their kinase domain is similar to the

546
00:22:56,519 --> 00:23:02,918
rlks but they lack uh an extracellular

547
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:05,798
domain and there's a a number of

548
00:23:02,919 --> 00:23:08,480
different um uh subfamilies within the

549
00:23:05,798 --> 00:23:11,158
RLC Cas and one particular sub family

550
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:13,200
called subam 7 uh has been demonstrated

551
00:23:11,159 --> 00:23:15,400
to be important in immunity uh in a

552
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:19,679
Rabbid opsis and so here is just the

553
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:22,200
philogyny of um subfam 7 and why we

554
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:25,080
became interested initially in pbl 13 is

555
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:27,080
because it's closely related uh to ripk

556
00:23:25,079 --> 00:23:28,960
um and other members that are uh have

557
00:23:27,079 --> 00:23:33,158
been intensely studied in this area are

558
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:34,960
also um uh PBS 5 and bi one and they all

559
00:23:33,159 --> 00:23:38,400
belong to the sub family

560
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:41,558
7 but pbl 13 actually looks uh different

561
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:45,159
than these other rlck and that's because

562
00:23:41,558 --> 00:23:47,440
um it has a unique amino acid repeat uh

563
00:23:45,159 --> 00:23:49,960
of 15 amino acids that are repeated five

564
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:53,798
times at its C Terminus uh the rest of

565
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:55,919
the rlck looks very similar to other RLC

566
00:23:53,798 --> 00:23:57,558
it has all of the um catalytic

567
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:59,278
subdomains that would You' predict it

568
00:23:57,558 --> 00:24:01,480
would be an active k

569
00:23:59,278 --> 00:24:03,119
uh it has a pilation motif at its in

570
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:06,038
Terminus and we've shown that it can go

571
00:24:03,119 --> 00:24:08,439
to the membrane as well so a graduate

572
00:24:06,038 --> 00:24:11,400
student in the lab Dan Lynn was um

573
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:13,480
focused on the role of pbl 13 and so he

574
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:17,000
obtained two different tdna insertion

575
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:20,120
lines in pb13 one's called pbl

576
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:22,599
13-1 and the other one which has a tdna

577
00:24:20,119 --> 00:24:25,359
insertion right before this amino acid

578
00:24:22,599 --> 00:24:27,918
repeat and it's a truncated alal uh and

579
00:24:25,359 --> 00:24:30,079
the other is pbl 13-2 that has a tdna

580
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:32,799
insertion closer to the beginning of the

581
00:24:30,079 --> 00:24:35,599
um Gene and is a true knockout and what

582
00:24:32,798 --> 00:24:38,038
we found is that both tdna insertions

583
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:40,278
had identical disease phenotypes uh

584
00:24:38,038 --> 00:24:43,119
which indicates that this C Terminus uh

585
00:24:40,278 --> 00:24:45,000
is important for pbl 13 function and so

586
00:24:43,119 --> 00:24:47,558
here is just phenotype after dip

587
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:49,599
inoculation with virulent pomonis you

588
00:24:47,558 --> 00:24:52,480
can see Colombia's diseased you see

589
00:24:49,599 --> 00:24:54,879
yellowing here uh whereas the tdna

590
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:58,079
insertion uh looks much better and if we

591
00:24:54,880 --> 00:25:00,520
look um either by dip or after pressure

592
00:24:58,079 --> 00:25:03,119
in filtration syringe infiltration we

593
00:25:00,519 --> 00:25:05,558
can see that um these tdna insertion

594
00:25:03,119 --> 00:25:07,839
lines uh exhibit enhanced disease

595
00:25:05,558 --> 00:25:10,519
resistance so here's bacterial growth on

596
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:13,319
the y- axis and you can see uh both of

597
00:25:10,519 --> 00:25:14,960
these have at least a log uh decrease in

598
00:25:13,319 --> 00:25:18,240
bacterial growth so it's pretty strong

599
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:20,278
phenotype and we can complement um this

600
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:22,480
enhanced resistance phenotype uh by

601
00:25:20,278 --> 00:25:25,839
adding in Wild type pbl

602
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:29,000
13 so it looks like pbl 13 is an active

603
00:25:25,839 --> 00:25:31,599
kise um and indeed when we performed in

604
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:34,000
vitrinas activity assays with radio

605
00:25:31,599 --> 00:25:36,439
labeled p32 we can see that it is an

606
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,119
active chinise uh we already knew rip K

607
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:41,200
is a chinise so we use this as a

608
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:43,239
positive control pbl 13 can uh Auto

609
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:46,759
phosphorate and trans phosphorate a

610
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:48,919
common kyes substrate and then uh if we

611
00:25:46,759 --> 00:25:51,000
have this lysine mutant it's no longer

612
00:25:48,919 --> 00:25:53,159
an active chinise and what we also

613
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:57,000
noticed is this is recant protein from

614
00:25:53,159 --> 00:25:59,799
ecoli here while typ pbl 13 U migrated

615
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:02,278
abnormally large based on SDs page gels

616
00:25:59,798 --> 00:26:04,359
whereas the kyes dead variant uh ran at

617
00:26:02,278 --> 00:26:06,759
its predicted molecular weight and we

618
00:26:04,359 --> 00:26:09,719
know that uh by treatment with SIP that

619
00:26:06,759 --> 00:26:11,640
this is due to um heavy Auto

620
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:14,278
phosphorilation and then we tested the

621
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:17,000
importance of kinas activity uh for its

622
00:26:14,278 --> 00:26:19,558
resistance phenotype and we can see that

623
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:21,759
the pbl 13's kinas activity is actually

624
00:26:19,558 --> 00:26:23,158
functionally required because you can't

625
00:26:21,759 --> 00:26:25,919
complement the enhanced disease

626
00:26:23,159 --> 00:26:29,200
resistance phenotype by adding in a kyes

627
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:32,159
dead variant of pbl 13

628
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:35,399
so we were interested in what uh

629
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:37,919
residues within pbl 13 are actually

630
00:26:35,398 --> 00:26:40,319
phosphorated so we subjected the protein

631
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:42,600
to mass spectrometry and mapped phosphor

632
00:26:40,319 --> 00:26:44,720
related sites and what we could see is

633
00:26:42,599 --> 00:26:47,959
there are few residues within the kise

634
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:50,720
domain that are phosphorated and uh

635
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:52,120
there the serine serine and thine but if

636
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:54,240
you look at the percentage of the

637
00:26:52,119 --> 00:26:56,239
phosphopeptide distribution we can see

638
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:59,359
that the vast these this correlates to

639
00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:01,798
one Spectra and round three Spectra

640
00:26:59,359 --> 00:27:03,719
respectively uh but the vast majority of

641
00:27:01,798 --> 00:27:06,278
phosphorilated residues are present

642
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:08,720
within this repeat region um and since

643
00:27:06,278 --> 00:27:10,398
it's a repeat region it was a little bit

644
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:12,519
difficult to actually nail down

645
00:27:10,398 --> 00:27:14,239
unambiguously what particular residues

646
00:27:12,519 --> 00:27:17,038
were phosphorated so we used a few

647
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:19,599
different enzymes and we could get um

648
00:27:17,038 --> 00:27:21,720
some uh unambiguous Spectra uh

649
00:27:19,599 --> 00:27:22,879
indicating that likely this repeat of

650
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:26,159
threein

651
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:29,000
serene is phosphorated on most of the

652
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:32,159
repeats so we're interested now and why

653
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:34,200
actually pbl 13 is more resistant um we

654
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:37,399
hypothesize it's a negative regulator if

655
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:40,360
we look at um uh the plants they don't

656
00:27:37,398 --> 00:27:42,678
actually look um uh phenotypically

657
00:27:40,359 --> 00:27:44,439
different uh than wild type of rabid

658
00:27:42,679 --> 00:27:48,320
opsis they don't have much higher levels

659
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:50,000
of salicylic acid um but we do think

660
00:27:48,319 --> 00:27:51,439
that it and so there we think it's

661
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,398
actually uh but we do think it's a

662
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:54,880
negative regulator because it has such a

663
00:27:53,398 --> 00:27:56,759
strong enhanced disease resistance

664
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:58,760
phenotype and we know that immune

665
00:27:56,759 --> 00:28:00,558
responses have to be uh tightly

666
00:27:58,759 --> 00:28:03,599
regulated there is a trade-off between

667
00:28:00,558 --> 00:28:06,200
plant growth uh and plant defense and so

668
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:08,319
the timing and also the amplitude uh of

669
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:10,960
immune responses are tightly controlled

670
00:28:08,319 --> 00:28:13,798
within the plant so these are just some

671
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:16,880
common outputs of plant immunity uh and

672
00:28:13,798 --> 00:28:19,679
we looked at a few of them for pbl 13 so

673
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:22,360
one is you get this uh uh reactive

674
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:25,159
oxygen uh Ross burst this extracellular

675
00:28:22,359 --> 00:28:28,119
Ross burst upon pathogen perception um

676
00:28:25,159 --> 00:28:30,080
this is by an nadph oxidase this uh

677
00:28:28,119 --> 00:28:32,879
extracellular Ross then serves as an

678
00:28:30,079 --> 00:28:35,480
antimicrobial it can also uh lead to

679
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:37,240
cell wall reinforcement um and then

680
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:39,079
Downstream of immune perception very

681
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:40,798
early events also are this calcium

682
00:28:39,079 --> 00:28:43,319
influx which is an important secondary

683
00:28:40,798 --> 00:28:46,599
messenger you also get activation of

684
00:28:43,319 --> 00:28:48,439
specific map kyes Cascades that lead to

685
00:28:46,599 --> 00:28:50,959
um transcriptional reprogramming in the

686
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:54,360
nucleus so we looked at a few of these

687
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:56,679
Ross uh and map Kines activation and

688
00:28:54,359 --> 00:28:59,918
what we're able to show is that the pbl

689
00:28:56,679 --> 00:29:02,919
13 knockout has enhanced M induced Ross

690
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:05,120
burst uh so here what we do to measure

691
00:29:02,919 --> 00:29:07,600
the Ross burst is we use luminol based

692
00:29:05,119 --> 00:29:10,038
acid and so here you can see the sum of

693
00:29:07,599 --> 00:29:11,798
the relative light units on the Y AIS

694
00:29:10,038 --> 00:29:15,240
and then the different genotypes on the

695
00:29:11,798 --> 00:29:18,639
x-axis so uh when we add in uh a

696
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:21,599
bacterial mamp called um L8 uh what we

697
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:24,240
see is that you can get uh rapid Ross

698
00:29:21,599 --> 00:29:26,719
production in Colombia the pbl 13

699
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:28,679
knockout has higher Ross burst and this

700
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:32,319
can be complemented by when of the pbl

701
00:29:28,679 --> 00:29:35,038
13 complementation lines um also uh if

702
00:29:32,319 --> 00:29:38,119
we apply bacterial immunogenic epitope

703
00:29:35,038 --> 00:29:41,278
of bacterial fuelin we can see that uh

704
00:29:38,119 --> 00:29:45,000
Colombia can respond to this um the pbl

705
00:29:41,278 --> 00:29:47,038
13 knockout has an enhanced response and

706
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:49,119
this can be complemented uh in the

707
00:29:47,038 --> 00:29:51,919
complementation lines the next thing we

708
00:29:49,119 --> 00:29:54,319
looked at uh was map kinas

709
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:57,440
activation and here what we can see is

710
00:29:54,319 --> 00:30:02,000
that um this occurs between typically 10

711
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:03,798
and 15 minutes uh after uh applying uh

712
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:06,759
recognized microbial pattern here we're

713
00:30:03,798 --> 00:30:09,398
looking at bacterial uh flag 22 um

714
00:30:06,759 --> 00:30:12,079
application so you can see a strong

715
00:30:09,398 --> 00:30:14,719
expression of phosphorated map kinases

716
00:30:12,079 --> 00:30:17,359
around 15 minutes um after treatment but

717
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:20,038
we see faster um expression at 5 minutes

718
00:30:17,359 --> 00:30:22,359
in the pbl 13 knockout and then this is

719
00:30:20,038 --> 00:30:24,480
just the felin receptor mutant uh as a

720
00:30:22,359 --> 00:30:26,158
negative control and so both of these

721
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:28,919
are very early processes this is going

722
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:31,519
to occur around 10 minutes after

723
00:30:28,919 --> 00:30:33,919
bacterial or or pathogen perception the

724
00:30:31,519 --> 00:30:35,798
Ross burst occurs you know five to uh at

725
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:37,038
least by five minutes after perception

726
00:30:35,798 --> 00:30:38,440
so we think that this is going to be an

727
00:30:37,038 --> 00:30:40,879
early

728
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:44,399
response so we are interested in this

729
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:46,640
Ross uh phenotype and um previous work

730
00:30:44,398 --> 00:30:48,599
out of Jim anda's lab as well as Cal

731
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:51,840
Zip's lab had shown that a related

732
00:30:48,599 --> 00:30:54,759
chinise called Bick one is involved uh

733
00:30:51,839 --> 00:30:58,000
in phosphor lating the nadph oxidase

734
00:30:54,759 --> 00:31:00,759
rbohd and rbohd is responsible for

735
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:03,558
producing this extracellular Ross uh it

736
00:31:00,759 --> 00:31:05,319
produces a super oxide uh which is then

737
00:31:03,558 --> 00:31:07,319
rapidly dismutated into hydrogen

738
00:31:05,319 --> 00:31:09,558
peroxide and can serve as an

739
00:31:07,319 --> 00:31:13,319
antimicrobial and what they were able to

740
00:31:09,558 --> 00:31:15,519
show with Bick one is um after felin

741
00:31:13,319 --> 00:31:19,000
perception B one is able to associate

742
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:21,720
with rbohd phosphorate it and this act

743
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:24,240
to Prime subsequent phosphorilation by

744
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:26,960
calcium dependent protein kinases uh

745
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:29,720
leading to enhanced activity so because

746
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:31,919
pbl 13 had an opposite phenotype as Vic

747
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:32,639
one we are interested in its association

748
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:35,080
with

749
00:31:32,638 --> 00:31:37,638
RBD so here we're using a split

750
00:31:35,079 --> 00:31:39,359
luciferase assay where you can take um

751
00:31:37,638 --> 00:31:41,319
one protein and fuse it to one half of

752
00:31:39,359 --> 00:31:43,599
luciferase another protein fuse it to

753
00:31:41,319 --> 00:31:46,439
another half of luciferase and then if

754
00:31:43,599 --> 00:31:48,119
they uh associate you can see um uh

755
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:51,159
luminescence within the plant and this

756
00:31:48,119 --> 00:31:54,879
is transient expression in Nana so here

757
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:57,880
we can see that um pbl 13 can associate

758
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:59,679
with rbohd at a resting state but um

759
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:03,320
opposite to B one it rapidly

760
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:05,399
disassociates upon felin perception and

761
00:32:03,319 --> 00:32:07,319
this is a negative control on aquaporin

762
00:32:05,398 --> 00:32:09,319
that's also membrane localized uh to

763
00:32:07,319 --> 00:32:11,319
show that there's no signal there we

764
00:32:09,319 --> 00:32:13,519
also looked for associations by split

765
00:32:11,319 --> 00:32:16,558
luciferase or coip between primary

766
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:19,480
immune receptors uh and pbl 13 and we

767
00:32:16,558 --> 00:32:22,440
didn't detect

768
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:24,399
that so this is our current model uh for

769
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:26,200
pbl 13 function and I should also

770
00:32:24,398 --> 00:32:29,678
mention that we know that pbl 13 can

771
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:31,200
phosphorate rbohd uh C Terminus as well

772
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:34,080
and we're currently mapping those sites

773
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:36,519
by mass spectrometry so we see that pbl

774
00:32:34,079 --> 00:32:38,960
13 has enhanced disease resistance it

775
00:32:36,519 --> 00:32:42,440
has a higher Ross burst and faster map

776
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:44,880
kyes kinetics um and we hypothesize that

777
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:47,038
it acts to suppress defense responses in

778
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:49,720
the absence of pathogen

779
00:32:47,038 --> 00:32:51,440
perception uh it's Unique among rlck

780
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:53,839
because it has an extended SE terminal

781
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:55,360
domain that's heavily phosphorated at

782
00:32:53,839 --> 00:32:57,599
least in vitro we're interested in

783
00:32:55,359 --> 00:32:59,798
determining the importance uh in Vivo of

784
00:32:57,599 --> 00:33:03,480
P bl13 C terminal

785
00:32:59,798 --> 00:33:05,599
phosphorilation um and um we think that

786
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:07,798
it could compete with bi one to regulate

787
00:33:05,599 --> 00:33:09,638
the extracellular Ros first so we know

788
00:33:07,798 --> 00:33:11,960
there's different pools of pd13 within

789
00:33:09,638 --> 00:33:14,199
the plant cell uh potentially one pool

790
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:16,038
could be involved in suppressing uh map

791
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:18,120
kinas activation because we know rth

792
00:33:16,038 --> 00:33:20,440
first and map kinas perception can be

793
00:33:18,119 --> 00:33:22,839
genetically uncoupled uh but there's a

794
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:25,278
pool of pbl 13 that can also associate

795
00:33:22,839 --> 00:33:27,398
with rbohd potentially phosphor relating

796
00:33:25,278 --> 00:33:29,519
it at novel sites in order to suppress

797
00:33:27,398 --> 00:33:32,558
activ in the absence of pathogen

798
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:35,359
perception uh but in the presence uh of

799
00:33:32,558 --> 00:33:38,278
pathogen perception or elicitors pbl 13

800
00:33:35,359 --> 00:33:40,798
disassociates enabling bit one to come

801
00:33:38,278 --> 00:33:42,960
in and phosphorate which then primes for

802
00:33:40,798 --> 00:33:45,558
subsequent phosphorilation by calcium

803
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:50,079
dependent protein kinases uh and an

804
00:33:45,558 --> 00:33:50,079
enhanced Ross burst uh upon pathogen

805
00:33:50,638 --> 00:33:55,038
perception okay so now I'm going to

806
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:58,120
switch years and talk uh about uh the

807
00:33:55,038 --> 00:34:00,278
final project uh and this is uh looking

808
00:33:58,119 --> 00:34:02,918
at the interaction between a gram

809
00:34:00,278 --> 00:34:06,038
positive bacterial pathogen clava

810
00:34:02,919 --> 00:34:07,879
michiganensis subspecies michiganensis

811
00:34:06,038 --> 00:34:10,719
uh and

812
00:34:07,878 --> 00:34:12,239
tomato so uh this pathogen causes

813
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:14,358
bacterial canker of tomato I've just

814
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:17,319
shown some disease symptoms here it

815
00:34:14,358 --> 00:34:20,159
proliferates in the xylon vessels uh and

816
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:22,599
if you uh look at an infected tomato

817
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:25,358
stem you can see Browning of the xylem

818
00:34:22,599 --> 00:34:27,559
here uh there's also Leaf symptoms where

819
00:34:25,358 --> 00:34:29,159
you can this is called Leaf firing stage

820
00:34:27,559 --> 00:34:31,078
where where you can get marginal leaflet

821
00:34:29,159 --> 00:34:33,440
necrosis uh which is a Hallmark of the

822
00:34:31,079 --> 00:34:35,800
disease as well and then if there's a

823
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:37,358
lot of bacteria around flowering uh

824
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:39,240
during flowering you can get fruit

825
00:34:37,358 --> 00:34:41,199
symptoms these are called Bird's eyee

826
00:34:39,239 --> 00:34:43,398
spots because there's a black spot

827
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:45,398
surrounded by a white margin or Halo and

828
00:34:43,398 --> 00:34:47,759
you can also get infection of the

829
00:34:45,398 --> 00:34:49,078
vasculature of the fruit uh by the

830
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:52,599
pathogen as

831
00:34:49,079 --> 00:34:55,639
well um sources of inoculum are infected

832
00:34:52,599 --> 00:34:58,000
seeds uh infected tool staks or

833
00:34:55,639 --> 00:35:00,519
transplants um the bacteria can also

834
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:03,800
survive several years on crop debris in

835
00:35:00,519 --> 00:35:06,400
the field um and uh when you have this

836
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:08,160
canker formation what happens is the

837
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:10,440
bacteria then will ooze out get

838
00:35:08,159 --> 00:35:13,159
bacterial streaming and in the presence

839
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:14,920
of water uh they can then move from one

840
00:35:13,159 --> 00:35:17,879
plant to another plant so that can serve

841
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:22,880
as a secondary source of an ulum as

842
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:25,760
well so um uh CMM has a high GC content

843
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:27,720
uh it's xylem limited it's subjected to

844
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:30,640
International quarantine because it's

845
00:35:27,719 --> 00:35:33,399
particularly problematic uh within um

846
00:35:30,639 --> 00:35:35,480
Glass House Greenhouse production uh and

847
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:37,599
there's no genetic resistance in

848
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:39,440
commercial cultivars uh there have been

849
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:41,960
a few sources of resistance that have

850
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:44,280
been identified uh in Wild tomato

851
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:47,480
species but they're primarily associated

852
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:49,079
with altered um vascular morphology and

853
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:51,000
so they have negative Horticultural

854
00:35:49,079 --> 00:35:53,119
attributes that are associated with them

855
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:55,559
so uh they haven't been successful and

856
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:59,559
then transferring those into cultivated

857
00:35:55,559 --> 00:36:01,599
germ plasm so right now the control stat

858
00:35:59,559 --> 00:36:04,400
strategy is sea disinfestation copper

859
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:06,480
sprays don't really work very well um

860
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:08,559
and uh in the literature there's one

861
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:11,280
completely finished reference genome uh

862
00:36:08,559 --> 00:36:13,119
that was published a number of years ago

863
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:16,079
so what we are interested in doing is

864
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:17,920
collecting a large number of CMM strains

865
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:19,920
uh to represent the worldwide diversity

866
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:22,400
and then using philogyny to sequence a

867
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:24,358
number of these strains and so here is

868
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:26,039
just a map that's highlighting the

869
00:36:24,358 --> 00:36:28,598
geographical distribution of these

870
00:36:26,039 --> 00:36:30,599
different uh CMM strains so we collected

871
00:36:28,599 --> 00:36:33,640
from six continents over about six

872
00:36:30,599 --> 00:36:35,760
decades uh and then used philogyny of

873
00:36:33,639 --> 00:36:37,400
five core housekeeping genes to try to

874
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:38,680
figure out which strains we really

875
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:41,519
wanted to

876
00:36:38,679 --> 00:36:46,078
sequence so we sequenced uh a number of

877
00:36:41,519 --> 00:36:48,199
different uh CMM strains um 34 uh

878
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:51,039
pathogenic strains and then five

879
00:36:48,199 --> 00:36:54,639
saprophytes so there are closely related

880
00:36:51,039 --> 00:36:56,039
um clava strains that are non-pathogenic

881
00:36:54,639 --> 00:36:58,838
that are saprophytic so they kind of

882
00:36:56,039 --> 00:37:00,559
hang out they'll uh grow a little bit

883
00:36:58,838 --> 00:37:02,679
within the Tomato uh but they won't

884
00:37:00,559 --> 00:37:05,239
cause disease but this is problematic

885
00:37:02,679 --> 00:37:08,440
because then if a grower wants to test

886
00:37:05,239 --> 00:37:09,919
to see if they have bacterial canker um

887
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:13,400
they these will light up with any kind

888
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:15,559
of currently based Eliza techniques so

889
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:17,720
um this is problematic for for Disease

890
00:37:15,559 --> 00:37:20,318
Control uh and also if they detect that

891
00:37:17,719 --> 00:37:21,598
there's actually um clav aaor there they

892
00:37:20,318 --> 00:37:24,639
have to get rid of all of their plants

893
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:27,079
when it could be just sapric clavor um

894
00:37:24,639 --> 00:37:29,679
now I mentioned that CMM has a high GC

895
00:37:27,079 --> 00:37:32,359
content it's at least 72% so we did

896
00:37:29,679 --> 00:37:33,799
aluminous sequencing um but that became

897
00:37:32,358 --> 00:37:36,078
and and it also has a number of

898
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:37,640
repetitive elements uh within the genome

899
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:39,599
but we couldn't get great assemblies

900
00:37:37,639 --> 00:37:42,118
just based on aluminous sequencing so

901
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:45,119
for a subset of these um we went in and

902
00:37:42,119 --> 00:37:46,519
did uh pack bio sequencing as well uh

903
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:47,760
and there that worked quite well we were

904
00:37:46,519 --> 00:37:50,639
able to get completely finished

905
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:53,440
reference genomes uh and completely uh

906
00:37:50,639 --> 00:37:56,679
uh complete plasmid uh sequences just in

907
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:58,838
a single shot um so what I'll talk about

908
00:37:56,679 --> 00:38:02,879
uh from now is mainly our work on the

909
00:37:58,838 --> 00:38:06,960
pack bio sequences um and we also

910
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:09,559
sequenced um in this number of 34 uh

911
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:12,679
some CMM strains that were collected uh

912
00:38:09,559 --> 00:38:17,000
within California as well so in

913
00:38:12,679 --> 00:38:20,000
2011 uh and also uh 2015 what we had in

914
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:22,280
California was this Vine decline disease

915
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:24,679
which uh basically what we've found

916
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:27,599
right now is that it's a combination of

917
00:38:24,679 --> 00:38:31,159
fungal infection of the roots uh as well

918
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:32,760
well as uh clava uh infection um which

919
00:38:31,159 --> 00:38:35,118
combines to have a decrease in

920
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:38,520
productivity during later stages uh of

921
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:40,119
the disease and so most of the tomatoes

922
00:38:38,519 --> 00:38:44,318
that are grown in California are for

923
00:38:40,119 --> 00:38:45,599
processing um and UC Davis is in Yolo

924
00:38:44,318 --> 00:38:47,599
County that's where they grow a lot of

925
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:49,000
tomatoes uh so we've collected a number

926
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:51,000
of isolates just right around the

927
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:53,639
university in collaboration with Farm

928
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:57,639
advisers and also the sanwa valley grows

929
00:38:53,639 --> 00:38:59,759
quite a bit of uh Tomatoes as well

930
00:38:57,639 --> 00:39:02,358
so um what we first looked at were the

931
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:04,680
plasmid complements um and as I

932
00:39:02,358 --> 00:39:06,598
mentioned there're saprophytic claba so

933
00:39:04,679 --> 00:39:08,559
this is one of the saites we sequenced

934
00:39:06,599 --> 00:39:11,240
you can inoculate but you don't see

935
00:39:08,559 --> 00:39:13,559
disease symptoms uh plants look healthy

936
00:39:11,239 --> 00:39:15,078
um this is one of the pathogenic uh

937
00:39:13,559 --> 00:39:17,000
strains that we sequenced and this is

938
00:39:15,079 --> 00:39:19,519
the reference genome that's been uh

939
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:23,119
studied the most so the reference genome

940
00:39:19,519 --> 00:39:25,960
has two plasmas pcm1 and pcm2 um both

941
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:28,400
are required for uh disease symptoms so

942
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:30,400
you can delete these uh from The genome

943
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:32,680
or or cure them from the

944
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:35,358
bacteria bacteria can still replicate

945
00:39:32,679 --> 00:39:37,440
but they don't cause wilting symptoms um

946
00:39:35,358 --> 00:39:40,159
what we found was there's a variation in

947
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:41,358
plasmid complement uh among the strains

948
00:39:40,159 --> 00:39:44,199
that we've sequenced which is really

949
00:39:41,358 --> 00:39:45,559
similar to what uh has been found for uh

950
00:39:44,199 --> 00:39:49,239
uh some of the strains that have come

951
00:39:45,559 --> 00:39:52,119
out of Cornell as well um and around the

952
00:39:49,239 --> 00:39:53,519
the Cornell area and in New York uh so

953
00:39:52,119 --> 00:39:54,838
they have vary in their plasmid

954
00:39:53,519 --> 00:39:58,119
complement all the strands that we

955
00:39:54,838 --> 00:40:00,639
sequenced have pcm1 um um but there's

956
00:39:58,119 --> 00:40:03,640
variation in the presence of pcm2 Andor

957
00:40:00,639 --> 00:40:06,159
presence of other plasmas um and sapres

958
00:40:03,639 --> 00:40:09,239
have neither pcm1 or pcm2 but they have

959
00:40:06,159 --> 00:40:12,239
a novel uh plasmid uh that we call PCM

960
00:40:09,239 --> 00:40:13,838
sap and if you look at this circos plot

961
00:40:12,239 --> 00:40:16,039
of the reference strain in one of the

962
00:40:13,838 --> 00:40:18,358
California strands for pcm1 it's similar

963
00:40:16,039 --> 00:40:20,318
for others you can see that uh these

964
00:40:18,358 --> 00:40:22,639
lines here indicate that U there's

965
00:40:20,318 --> 00:40:25,400
homology and those genes are present uh

966
00:40:22,639 --> 00:40:28,519
there's there's High homology between um

967
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:31,079
sap the other strains uh and the

968
00:40:28,519 --> 00:40:33,838
reference strain with respect to pcm1

969
00:40:31,079 --> 00:40:36,680
and if you look at bacterial growth um

970
00:40:33,838 --> 00:40:38,799
PCM uh 2 is not necessary because this

971
00:40:36,679 --> 00:40:40,598
California strain can grow quite well

972
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:42,160
just as well as the reference strain and

973
00:40:40,599 --> 00:40:44,880
then like I mentioned the sapry will

974
00:40:42,159 --> 00:40:48,279
grow a little bit but not to the same

975
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:50,720
extent so we looked at the The genome to

976
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:54,560
predict uh secreted affector proteins so

977
00:40:50,719 --> 00:40:56,679
this is a gr positive bacteria so um it

978
00:40:54,559 --> 00:40:58,880
can't deliver affectors directly into

979
00:40:56,679 --> 00:41:02,078
host cells but it can secrete affectors

980
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:04,000
direct outside of its own cell uh and so

981
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:06,280
what we found when we were mining for

982
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:09,119
the serrone is that there's a set of

983
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:12,000
about 40 affectors uh that are conserved

984
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:14,318
across pathogens and sapres there is

985
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:16,400
also around 10 that are only found in

986
00:41:14,318 --> 00:41:17,880
all the pathogens that we looked at and

987
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:19,800
then there's a variable number of

988
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:22,358
effectors as well if we look at these

989
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:25,359
conserved effectors most of them look

990
00:41:22,358 --> 00:41:27,318
like uh that at least that that have

991
00:41:25,358 --> 00:41:29,519
been have assigned potential fun

992
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:31,639
function would be degradative enzymes or

993
00:41:29,519 --> 00:41:33,639
secreted

994
00:41:31,639 --> 00:41:35,559
proteases then we also looked at the

995
00:41:33,639 --> 00:41:39,400
presence of genomic islands and so

996
00:41:35,559 --> 00:41:41,440
bacteria can acquire um uh uh DNA

997
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:45,480
horizontally either through conjugation

998
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:47,200
for plasmids viral infection or um uh

999
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:50,119
through the environment and this can be

1000
00:41:47,199 --> 00:41:52,879
detected uh based on their uh deviation

1001
00:41:50,119 --> 00:41:56,519
and GC content so if we look at the

1002
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:57,920
genomic Islands present U between sapres

1003
00:41:56,519 --> 00:42:00,000
pathogens and Cal California and

1004
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:02,240
pathogens in the reference drain we can

1005
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:06,480
see that most there's only one large

1006
00:42:02,239 --> 00:42:09,000
genomic Island that's present um both uh

1007
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:11,760
in the reference strain as well as all

1008
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:14,559
the other strains that we um sequenced

1009
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:17,400
and the other genomic islands are

1010
00:42:14,559 --> 00:42:20,639
variable and the genomic Island that's

1011
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:22,280
uh conserved is called the CHP T

1012
00:42:20,639 --> 00:42:24,440
pathogenicity cluster so I've just

1013
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:27,599
highlighted it here and you can see it's

1014
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:29,159
quite conserved um uh across the

1015
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:31,240
reference strain this is one of the

1016
00:42:29,159 --> 00:42:33,799
California strains and this is the sapry

1017
00:42:31,239 --> 00:42:36,759
where it's lacking so there's been some

1018
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:39,119
work that's been done on CHP Tom uh on

1019
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:41,440
in clav aactor we know if you delete the

1020
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:45,119
entire genomic Island it abolishes

1021
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:48,519
pathogenicity if you delete uh just chpc

1022
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:51,480
which is shown here in yellow um this is

1023
00:42:48,519 --> 00:42:54,358
a Serene protease it's secreted um that

1024
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:56,039
decreases virulence um and what we are

1025
00:42:54,358 --> 00:42:57,960
interested in is what about some

1026
00:42:56,039 --> 00:43:00,440
degradative enzymes because you do get

1027
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:01,960
this canker formation there's mation of

1028
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:03,599
the host tissue you get the stem

1029
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:05,480
splitting open during later stages of

1030
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:07,680
disease and we know that the genome

1031
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:11,079
encodes several putative degradative

1032
00:43:07,679 --> 00:43:13,318
enzymes um and so we focused on the

1033
00:43:11,079 --> 00:43:15,880
importance of two um potential

1034
00:43:13,318 --> 00:43:18,318
degradative enzymes Pelle 1 and Pelle 2

1035
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:21,318
that are conserved that are pectate

1036
00:43:18,318 --> 00:43:24,000
liases so if we look at Pelle 1 and

1037
00:43:21,318 --> 00:43:26,119
Pelle 2 they're predicted to be secreted

1038
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:28,000
they have a a central and this is

1039
00:43:26,119 --> 00:43:31,000
cleaved then afterwards we have a

1040
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:33,079
central pectate lias domain um if we

1041
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:35,719
look at crystallized pectate liases we

1042
00:43:33,079 --> 00:43:38,599
can generate high confidence uh models

1043
00:43:35,719 --> 00:43:41,039
it really looks like a pectate lias the

1044
00:43:38,599 --> 00:43:43,880
uh catalytic sites are conserved between

1045
00:43:41,039 --> 00:43:46,639
Pelle 1 Pelle 2 and characterize pectate

1046
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:49,119
liasis um and then if we perform

1047
00:43:46,639 --> 00:43:51,639
Knockouts uh of either Pelle one or

1048
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:54,920
Pelle 2 what we can see is that the

1049
00:43:51,639 --> 00:43:56,920
Pelle one deletion um in clavor has

1050
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:59,519
reduced symptom morphology we don't see

1051
00:43:56,920 --> 00:44:02,240
this Leaf firing stage whereas the Pelle

1052
00:43:59,519 --> 00:44:04,800
2 deletion doesn't really affect uh

1053
00:44:02,239 --> 00:44:07,159
bacterial virulence and we can see a

1054
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:09,720
decrease in bacterial growth uh but it's

1055
00:44:07,159 --> 00:44:12,440
not very robust here so this may be

1056
00:44:09,719 --> 00:44:14,679
affecting symptom morphology and not

1057
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:16,760
necessarily bacterial colonization but

1058
00:44:14,679 --> 00:44:18,519
we need to go back in and look over time

1059
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:19,839
and potentially look at movement within

1060
00:44:18,519 --> 00:44:22,079
the plant as

1061
00:44:19,838 --> 00:44:24,519
well uh and then if we look at

1062
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:26,760
expression of Pelle 1 and Pelle 2 uh if

1063
00:44:24,519 --> 00:44:29,199
we look in rich media both are expressed

1064
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:31,119
to fairly low level but if we look uh

1065
00:44:29,199 --> 00:44:33,199
and grow the bacteria in xylm mimicking

1066
00:44:31,119 --> 00:44:36,200
media minimal media we can see that

1067
00:44:33,199 --> 00:44:38,919
Pelle 1 uh is much stronger expressed

1068
00:44:36,199 --> 00:44:41,078
than Pelle 2 uh and Pelle 1 the deletion

1069
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:43,760
is the one that gives us a phenotype

1070
00:44:41,079 --> 00:44:46,920
after we inoculate on

1071
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:49,680
tomato so we've also used um these

1072
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:51,920
genome sequences to try to develop uh

1073
00:44:49,679 --> 00:44:55,039
diagnostic primers for Growers and

1074
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:57,400
Industry to use um so what we did is we

1075
00:44:55,039 --> 00:45:00,199
looked at um our genome sequences of

1076
00:44:57,400 --> 00:45:02,039
pathogenic clav actor sapric clav aactor

1077
00:45:00,199 --> 00:45:04,318
we also sequence some genomes of a

1078
00:45:02,039 --> 00:45:06,880
related pathogen um subspecies

1079
00:45:04,318 --> 00:45:09,358
sepedonicus that causes potato ring rot

1080
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:11,400
um and we designed about 10 different

1081
00:45:09,358 --> 00:45:14,279
PCR based primers uh that should

1082
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:16,119
specifically detect uh pathogenic clava

1083
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:18,079
but not saprophytes and then we found

1084
00:45:16,119 --> 00:45:21,000
two that very robustly amplify and

1085
00:45:18,079 --> 00:45:23,400
looked quite specific uh one is based on

1086
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:25,639
a sugar ABC transporter the other is

1087
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:28,039
based on a transcriptional regulator and

1088
00:45:25,639 --> 00:45:30,480
so uh We've provided these to Growers uh

1089
00:45:28,039 --> 00:45:34,039
to now use uh for Diagnostics where they

1090
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:36,880
wouldn't detect uh these sapres or other

1091
00:45:34,039 --> 00:45:38,599
pathogens so uh just to summarize we've

1092
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:42,079
completely finished genomes for about

1093
00:45:38,599 --> 00:45:44,640
seven um uh CMM strings using pack bio

1094
00:45:42,079 --> 00:45:46,599
uh use that to develop specific PCR

1095
00:45:44,639 --> 00:45:48,838
primers we know these strains are not

1096
00:45:46,599 --> 00:45:51,838
clonal there's variation in plasma

1097
00:45:48,838 --> 00:45:54,880
composition genomic Islands also uh in

1098
00:45:51,838 --> 00:45:58,078
secretome uh we can see there's about 10

1099
00:45:54,880 --> 00:46:00,119
core secreted uh proteins uh from uh

1100
00:45:58,079 --> 00:46:01,920
clav aactor and we' started to

1101
00:46:00,119 --> 00:46:03,599
investigate a subset of these secreted

1102
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:07,920
proteins for their role in bacterial

1103
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:09,800
virulence um the conserved uh Pelle one

1104
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:12,800
pectate lias is important for bacterial

1105
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:15,800
symptom morphology but deletion of a

1106
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:18,200
clustered and closely related um pectate

1107
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:20,119
lice Pelle 2 has no effect and that may

1108
00:46:18,199 --> 00:46:21,078
be because it's not robustly expressed

1109
00:46:20,119 --> 00:46:23,160
during

1110
00:46:21,079 --> 00:46:24,800
infection so I'd like to thank the

1111
00:46:23,159 --> 00:46:28,598
people in the lab that have done the

1112
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:31,599
work um work on on Ren 4 was uh

1113
00:46:28,599 --> 00:46:33,280
initially started by Jun Lee AE previous

1114
00:46:31,599 --> 00:46:36,440
postdoc in the lab who's now faculty

1115
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:39,640
member at Chinese Academy of Sciences um

1116
00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:41,240
and also uh dung hulley a graduate

1117
00:46:39,639 --> 00:46:43,799
student has worked on that project as

1118
00:46:41,239 --> 00:46:46,598
well work on pbl 13 was led by a former

1119
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:51,318
graduate student Dan Lynn um as well as

1120
00:46:46,599 --> 00:46:54,838
D huley and then um work on uh clab of

1121
00:46:51,318 --> 00:46:58,159
actor has been performed uh by a post in

1122
00:46:54,838 --> 00:47:00,159
the lab sharit tapa and then Coast uh

1123
00:46:58,159 --> 00:47:03,279
Thomas and Jessica have also contributed

1124
00:47:00,159 --> 00:47:05,399
to the ren4 project um also I'd like to

1125
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:09,390
thank my collaborators and then uh

1126
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:14,960
funding uh for support so thank

1127
00:47:09,389 --> 00:47:18,118
[Applause]

1128
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:20,000
you you know so the question wasc pbl 13

1129
00:47:18,119 --> 00:47:21,640
and ripk are closely related but it

1130
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:23,039
seems like they have different functions

1131
00:47:21,639 --> 00:47:25,358
uh so the question was are they

1132
00:47:23,039 --> 00:47:27,279
functionally redundant um initially the

1133
00:47:25,358 --> 00:47:30,039
reason why we were interested in PD 13

1134
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:31,559
is we thought that it could be um uh

1135
00:47:30,039 --> 00:47:32,880
functionally redundant with rip you

1136
00:47:31,559 --> 00:47:35,599
might be able to get more severe

1137
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:38,880
phenotypes when we made uh higher order

1138
00:47:35,599 --> 00:47:41,800
mutants and we we tried that so we have

1139
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:45,400
double mutants of PDL 13 and rip K but

1140
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:46,960
we don't see that there uh is more of a

1141
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:49,838
significant phenotype let's say with

1142
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:52,039
respect to activation uh of rpm1 or loss

1143
00:47:49,838 --> 00:47:53,679
of rpm1 activation than just the rip ke

1144
00:47:52,039 --> 00:47:56,480
knockout so I think they're actually

1145
00:47:53,679 --> 00:47:58,118
doing uh different things uh if you just

1146
00:47:56,480 --> 00:48:00,559
look at the the central region it looks

1147
00:47:58,119 --> 00:48:03,318
very very similar to uh rip K so what

1148
00:48:00,559 --> 00:48:06,680
we're trying to do now is just take um

1149
00:48:03,318 --> 00:48:08,960
pbl 13 central region and if we and see

1150
00:48:06,679 --> 00:48:11,719
if we can complement The ripk Knockout

1151
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:12,800
just with that as compared with fand um

1152
00:48:11,719 --> 00:48:14,519
but I think there's something that's

1153
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:17,119
going on with the c Terminus that might

1154
00:48:14,519 --> 00:48:19,239
determine specificity um we're also

1155
00:48:17,119 --> 00:48:21,640
doing some kise assays with truncated

1156
00:48:19,239 --> 00:48:24,639
pbl 13 versus full length to see if that

1157
00:48:21,639 --> 00:48:28,078
changes um ability to uh phosphorate

1158
00:48:24,639 --> 00:48:29,159
particular residues uh within Target

1159
00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:34,480
do you know anything about their

1160
00:48:29,159 --> 00:48:37,318
expression Express tis yeah so rip K is

1161
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:40,318
uh expressed in strongly in the root and

1162
00:48:37,318 --> 00:48:42,759
also within the uh the leaves but more

1163
00:48:40,318 --> 00:48:46,119
strongly in the root um and it has a

1164
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:49,440
much higher expression than pd13 so pd13

1165
00:48:46,119 --> 00:48:52,079
is very lowly expressed um in the root

1166
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:53,480
as well as in uh uh the leaf and in

1167
00:48:52,079 --> 00:48:55,839
cessing

1168
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:58,719
tissues U but it's its expression level

1169
00:48:55,838 --> 00:48:58,719
is quite low

1170
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:11,000
disase certainly has no commercial value

1171
00:49:08,519 --> 00:49:12,639
it oh okay so the question was for

1172
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:14,079
citrus Greening is it edible after

1173
00:49:12,639 --> 00:49:16,679
infection

1174
00:49:14,079 --> 00:49:21,318
well um in the juicing industry for

1175
00:49:16,679 --> 00:49:24,639
Florida uh they can do certain things to

1176
00:49:21,318 --> 00:49:27,519
um uh the juice like add sugars Etc and

1177
00:49:24,639 --> 00:49:29,598
then that will uh still enable them to

1178
00:49:27,519 --> 00:49:31,119
sell uh the product you know during

1179
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:34,440
later stages of disease it's going to

1180
00:49:31,119 --> 00:49:37,119
kill the Citrus plant so then obviously

1181
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:38,960
yield will be reduced but um part of the

1182
00:49:37,119 --> 00:49:40,559
phenotypes for citrus Greening and why

1183
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:44,400
they they called it Citrus Greening is

1184
00:49:40,559 --> 00:49:46,440
that you get this um inversion of uh rip

1185
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:48,400
the ripening of the fruit so usually uh

1186
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:50,358
it'll ripen at the bottom first and then

1187
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:52,280
go up and then here when you have citrus

1188
00:49:50,358 --> 00:49:54,798
Greening you have green at the bottom

1189
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:57,319
and then ripening at the top you get the

1190
00:49:54,798 --> 00:50:00,318
pathogen proliferates in the FL

1191
00:49:57,318 --> 00:50:03,719
and so you get more bitter fruit uh

1192
00:50:00,318 --> 00:50:05,838
because uh there's flow blockage uh by

1193
00:50:03,719 --> 00:50:08,439
uh Callos and so there's decreased uh

1194
00:50:05,838 --> 00:50:11,558
sugar accumulation within the fruit so

1195
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:13,440
it's possible to do some things uh for

1196
00:50:11,559 --> 00:50:16,599
uh it's juicing industry for a fresh

1197
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:20,440
market there's not much you can

1198
00:50:16,599 --> 00:50:22,318
do so the question is if the um pbl 13's

1199
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:24,159
General function is to dampen Ross as

1200
00:50:22,318 --> 00:50:27,558
the mutant have phenotypes in addition

1201
00:50:24,159 --> 00:50:29,679
to defense responses um so that's a good

1202
00:50:27,559 --> 00:50:32,000
question we're looking at that right now

1203
00:50:29,679 --> 00:50:34,719
so some of these rboh mutants have

1204
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:38,159
altered root morphology Etc we know that

1205
00:50:34,719 --> 00:50:40,039
pbl 13 is uh expressed in Roots and so I

1206
00:50:38,159 --> 00:50:41,358
don't have the answer uh now but we're

1207
00:50:40,039 --> 00:50:44,279
looking into it to see if they can

1208
00:50:41,358 --> 00:50:46,318
phenocopy uh some of those uh mutant

1209
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:47,798
phenotypes yeah and if they do then that

1210
00:50:46,318 --> 00:50:50,480
would I think that would indicate that

1211
00:50:47,798 --> 00:50:54,679
there may be um additional functions for

1212
00:50:50,480 --> 00:51:01,719
p 13 outside of just depend responses

1213
00:50:54,679 --> 00:51:04,078
