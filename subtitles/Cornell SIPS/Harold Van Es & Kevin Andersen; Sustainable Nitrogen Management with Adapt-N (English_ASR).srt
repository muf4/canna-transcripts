1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:04,280
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:06,439 --> 00:00:09,679
University so good afternoon everyone

3
00:00:08,718 --> 00:00:13,039
thank you for

4
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:15,879
coming um so I thought it would be

5
00:00:13,039 --> 00:00:19,198
interesting to give an update on on the

6
00:00:15,878 --> 00:00:22,198
adap end technology and uh uh

7
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:24,599
specifically how uh integration with

8
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:26,199
other software platforms is really

9
00:00:24,599 --> 00:00:29,960
critical if you want to bring this kind

10
00:00:26,199 --> 00:00:31,439
of technology to um to the farming Comm

11
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:33,359
Community before I do I want to

12
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:35,520
introduce this gentleman here is

13
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:37,200
Professor Rafael Otto he's been here for

14
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,200
a few weeks now but I hadn't had a

15
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:43,520
chance to introduce him he's a professor

16
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:46,199
uh at the of soral science at the um

17
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:48,640
university of sa Paulo in Brazil and so

18
00:00:46,198 --> 00:00:51,479
he's uh interested in this particular

19
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:55,039
Topic in improving nitogen

20
00:00:51,479 --> 00:00:57,640
recommendations so um with that so Kevin

21
00:00:55,039 --> 00:01:00,198
will do the uh the second part remotely

22
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:01,920
he is in Minnesota right now uh but we

23
00:01:00,198 --> 00:01:05,438
thought it would be a great way to kind

24
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:07,719
of talk about uh the uh the opp

25
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:11,519
opportunities around this kind of

26
00:01:07,719 --> 00:01:12,400
integration okay uh so quick uh overview

27
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:15,599
so

28
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:19,240
adapten um has a bit of a history coming

29
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:23,639
out of uh Cornell out of my program very

30
00:01:19,239 --> 00:01:26,560
much a team effort and um we um rolled

31
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:31,478
it out in 2008 which is already 16 years

32
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:34,320
ago and uh then in 2013 we decided that

33
00:01:31,478 --> 00:01:37,438
uh it wasn't um good to remain in the

34
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:40,559
public space and uh so we uh decided to

35
00:01:37,438 --> 00:01:43,279
license it to a startup company um and

36
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:46,960
then uh we continued working on it and

37
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:49,599
it became a cloud-based uh uh solution

38
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:52,319
and we did a lot of uh uh on fire

39
00:01:49,599 --> 00:01:55,438
validation of the of the technology then

40
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:57,438
in 2017 was a was a great year for us at

41
00:01:55,438 --> 00:02:00,239
uh the startup company was acquired by

42
00:01:57,438 --> 00:02:02,758
Yara International which is uh big

43
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:05,118
Global uh crop Nutrition Company it's a

44
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:07,599
Norwegian company they're in like 160

45
00:02:05,118 --> 00:02:09,479
countries or so uh we want a big

46
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:11,318
International price around the same time

47
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:14,640
I think they were only a month apart so

48
00:02:11,318 --> 00:02:17,479
was was a very nice time um working also

49
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:18,839
on API integration so integration with

50
00:02:17,479 --> 00:02:21,759
other software

51
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:24,360
systems and then uh earlier this year

52
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:28,039
Yara sold the adap and Technology to

53
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:30,599
ever a which is a really a u sort of

54
00:02:28,039 --> 00:02:32,959
digital uh agriculture

55
00:02:30,598 --> 00:02:36,119
uh platform and so they they have field

56
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:38,719
management software but also uh

57
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:41,280
livestock related uh I believe insurance

58
00:02:38,719 --> 00:02:43,400
and financing uh so they're a very big

59
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,479
player in the in the digital uh

60
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:48,560
agriculture

61
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:51,039
space um just quickly I'm not going to

62
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:55,000
go into details but you know uh this has

63
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:56,919
very much been a a multiple team efforts

64
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,560
uh here at at Cornell

65
00:02:56,919 --> 00:03:01,158
University um as well as when it went

66
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:04,000
commercial commercial uh some very

67
00:03:01,158 --> 00:03:07,199
talented entrepreneurs software

68
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,479
Engineers uh marketing people and all of

69
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:12,479
that and we also worked with many

70
00:03:09,479 --> 00:03:15,238
farmers consultants in uh you know in

71
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:18,679
New York in Iowa in in North Carolina

72
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:22,439
many many other places to uh validate

73
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:26,439
and and test and refine the system okay

74
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:28,438
so why why ad OP 10 so nitrogen is uh by

75
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:30,318
far the most problematic of the crop

76
00:03:28,438 --> 00:03:31,878
nutrients I would say

77
00:03:30,318 --> 00:03:34,958
uh that's not an overstatement I don't

78
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:36,878
think uh from the uh sort of farmer

79
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:39,799
perspective it's

80
00:03:36,878 --> 00:03:42,199
costly uh the use efficiency tends to be

81
00:03:39,799 --> 00:03:44,760
relatively low uh because there's a lot

82
00:03:42,199 --> 00:03:46,798
of losses and there's a lot of

83
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:49,959
uncertainty around it especially as it

84
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:52,040
relates to weather and uh by uh that

85
00:03:49,959 --> 00:03:54,560
Association also you know High

86
00:03:52,039 --> 00:03:55,479
sensitivity to climate change especially

87
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,438
extreme

88
00:03:55,479 --> 00:04:02,359
events from an environmental perspective

89
00:03:58,438 --> 00:04:05,519
five major concerns uh big energy input

90
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:07,560
into cropping systems uh nitrous oxide

91
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:10,158
of course the big greenhouse gas uh

92
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:13,280
concern groundwater nitrate

93
00:04:10,158 --> 00:04:16,279
levels uh as well as the hypoxia and

94
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:19,560
anoxia concerns in estuaries the dead

95
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:22,959
zones and then particulate formation

96
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:25,839
from ammonia of lization so a lot of

97
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:28,758
concerns there I'm going to go into a

98
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:31,519
little bit more depth um so when we

99
00:04:28,759 --> 00:04:34,360
think about the input puts into the

100
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:37,038
system into a field you might say we

101
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:39,360
have kind of two major inputs one is

102
00:04:37,038 --> 00:04:42,439
through the biological pathway mostly

103
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:44,600
legumes or maybe some free living

104
00:04:42,439 --> 00:04:48,560
bacteria of course the synthetic

105
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:49,800
industrial uh process Hab BOS notably

106
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:53,560
takes a lot of

107
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:56,120
energy um Berkland a by the way is an

108
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:58,280
older um uh technology that was

109
00:04:56,120 --> 00:05:00,959
developed by Yara at the time norsk

110
00:04:58,279 --> 00:05:02,519
Hydro uh that now is gaining some

111
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:05,719
interest because of the green interest

112
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:08,399
in green ammonia uh using renewable

113
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:10,360
energy um and then of course a lot of

114
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:13,000
you know uh there's a lot of cycling of

115
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:16,160
this organic nitrogen uh through the so

116
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,680
organic matter or inputs or residues or

117
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,160
things like that so you have all these

118
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,439
different sources of nitrogen that you

119
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:24,400
have to deal with and then you have a

120
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:26,160
fairly complicated nitrogen cycle and I

121
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:29,159
won't go into details but you have all

122
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,160
these inputs that I U mentioned and most

123
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:32,479
of the

124
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:35,120
Transformations that happen in the soil

125
00:05:32,478 --> 00:05:37,719
are microbially mediated so that means

126
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:39,639
that they're impacted by the the

127
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:42,240
environment you know the temperature

128
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:44,840
water but also crop management practices

129
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:47,439
and all of those kind of things most

130
00:05:44,839 --> 00:05:50,679
nitrogen in Aerobic environments ends up

131
00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:52,519
in the nitrate form and thereby is then

132
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:55,840
subject to losses so either leeching

133
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:59,120
losses or denitrification losses both

134
00:05:55,839 --> 00:06:01,599
being obviously very problematic and

135
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:04,160
then these uh Transformations and and

136
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:06,639
the associated crop and availability can

137
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:08,120
change dramatically in very short uh

138
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:12,120
periods of time especially if you get a

139
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:14,079
lot of rainfall so that's a challenge a

140
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:15,959
little bit about the hypoxia Zone

141
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:17,680
because that's very relevant in uh when

142
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:19,799
you are dealing with n especially in

143
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:21,759
corn production systems you're probably

144
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:23,800
most uh most of you are familiar with

145
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:26,560
that especially in the Mississippi River

146
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:30,280
Basin uh the large uh so-called dead

147
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:33,800
zone that develops typically in mid to

148
00:06:30,279 --> 00:06:36,198
late summer and uh this past year this

149
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:38,520
is an updated graph it uh The Dead Zone

150
00:06:36,199 --> 00:06:42,199
was again about the size of the state of

151
00:06:38,519 --> 00:06:45,598
New Jersey very large area where um

152
00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:48,720
basically most of the uh uh the fish are

153
00:06:45,598 --> 00:06:52,680
being killed because of a lack of oxygen

154
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:55,680
um and U and this is the uh I should

155
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:58,519
say this is the level of the hypoxia

156
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:00,120
task force goal Which is less than 1,900

157
00:06:58,519 --> 00:07:02,318
M square miles

158
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:04,360
and uh they have not been able to reach

159
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:07,680
that for quite a while so a lot of money

160
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:10,800
being poured into it but relatively few

161
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:14,680
results um the hypoxia Task Force is is

162
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:16,120
pushing the states to uh reduce their uh

163
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:19,519
nitrogen

164
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:21,280
losses uh and reduce them by 45% that's

165
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:25,120
what these two states they're big corn

166
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:27,878
states of course what their goals are um

167
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:30,360
long-term 45% with no timeline which is

168
00:07:27,879 --> 00:07:33,960
very convenient uh

169
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:36,560
but for 2025 they said minus 15% uh

170
00:07:33,959 --> 00:07:38,519
which as far as I know has not been

171
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,959
reached I don't think that they've tried

172
00:07:38,519 --> 00:07:43,279
that hard quite

173
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:44,878
frankly the greenhouse gas emissions so

174
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:47,559
nitrous oxide is about

175
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:50,520
18% of the global greenhouse gas

176
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:51,280
emissions uh so a little less than let's

177
00:07:50,519 --> 00:07:55,279
say

178
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:58,439
one5 um the I think what's notable is

179
00:07:55,279 --> 00:08:00,559
how little attention it gets and uh most

180
00:07:58,439 --> 00:08:04,519
of the attention goes to carbon dioxide

181
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:07,280
and of course methane for us a it's uh a

182
00:08:04,519 --> 00:08:10,079
little over 50% of the greenhouse gas

183
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:12,079
emissions are associated with nitrous

184
00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:14,120
oxide uh and that's more than the

185
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:17,959
methane by the way doesn't this look

186
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:20,399
like a like an a precedential polling

187
00:08:17,959 --> 00:08:22,000
result of the past few days especially

188
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:25,638
with the red and the blue and all of

189
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:30,478
that you know but it's not um but it

190
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:32,560
seems kind of tough but anyway so uh so

191
00:08:30,478 --> 00:08:35,278
pretty significant right uh and very

192
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:37,119
little attention being paid to it U for

193
00:08:35,278 --> 00:08:39,278
New York sorry you can't see that it has

194
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:42,120
a little thing here with that's a that's

195
00:08:39,278 --> 00:08:43,519
a zoom thing uh it's about onethird Is

196
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:45,959
nitrous oxide we have a lot more

197
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:48,480
livestock especially dairy industry uh

198
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:51,759
in New York so methane is is is a bigger

199
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:54,759
deal um I think the nitrous oxide uh

200
00:08:51,759 --> 00:08:57,159
estimates are a little low for New York

201
00:08:54,759 --> 00:08:59,838
um but New York is all in on the on on

202
00:08:57,159 --> 00:09:01,879
the methane it's a Millions of dollars

203
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:04,760
are going to that very little as far as

204
00:09:01,879 --> 00:09:09,200
I know uh on the nitrous oxide

205
00:09:04,759 --> 00:09:11,879
issue okay so in order to understand uh

206
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:14,320
why it's difficult to affect change with

207
00:09:11,879 --> 00:09:16,919
Farmers on on niten we need to

208
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:19,600
understand the risk so farmers are

209
00:09:16,919 --> 00:09:21,519
inherently Risk Managers you got to have

210
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:25,600
nerves of Steel to be a farmer these

211
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:27,679
days so um if we have here an economic

212
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:31,480
Optimum end rate that's that's the the

213
00:09:27,679 --> 00:09:33,199
perfectly right 9 rate for a particular

214
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:35,480
crop in a particular field and you know

215
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:38,480
think corn because that's our Focus here

216
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:41,240
so risk is probability times cost and we

217
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:43,480
have this asymmetric risk for the farmer

218
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:46,320
that is if they under fertilize because

219
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:48,320
there's uncertainty around this eonr if

220
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,560
they under fertilize it's a lot more

221
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:53,040
costly to them than if they over

222
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:54,518
fertilize because they lose yield and

223
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:57,278
especially when the grain prices are

224
00:09:54,519 --> 00:09:59,480
high which they were a few years ago uh

225
00:09:57,278 --> 00:10:01,958
they uh they don't want to lose yield

226
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:05,720
they can't afford that if you over

227
00:10:01,958 --> 00:10:08,039
fertilize you wasted money on fertilizer

228
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:10,320
okay but that's much less costly that

229
00:10:08,039 --> 00:10:14,240
that's a much lower risk right so the

230
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:15,640
farmer has an incentive to always make

231
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:18,360
sure that there's enough nitrogen that

232
00:10:15,639 --> 00:10:19,799
means that they tend to apply excess

233
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:21,600
nitrogen and that's just realistic

234
00:10:19,799 --> 00:10:23,879
that's just risk management on their

235
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:26,839
part but from a societal perspective

236
00:10:23,879 --> 00:10:29,759
it's kind of the opposite in that we

237
00:10:26,839 --> 00:10:32,200
like to see Farmers apply less might as

238
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:34,679
INF fertilizer and not over fertilized

239
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:36,200
because then you see a lot of losses

240
00:10:34,679 --> 00:10:38,359
some of our work some of the work that

241
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:40,720
was done at M Michigan State where we've

242
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:42,959
been able to demonstrate once you exceed

243
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:46,360
the planned update you obviously have a

244
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:50,439
lot more losses right so this is kind of

245
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:52,399
uh uh opposing interests right so what's

246
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:54,880
the solution to that well from our

247
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:57,000
perspective the solution is to get this

248
00:10:54,879 --> 00:11:00,159
uncertainty down to very minimal so that

249
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:02,759
we can estimate what is the proper

250
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:05,078
uh nitrogen rate for your crop in any

251
00:11:02,759 --> 00:11:07,600
particular field in any particular year

252
00:11:05,078 --> 00:11:12,239
in any particular location

253
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:14,079
okay so the industry um let me get rid

254
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:16,600
of that okay

255
00:11:14,078 --> 00:11:18,679
here the industry response to that has

256
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:20,839
been the four RS of nutrient management

257
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:22,278
so right Source right rate right time

258
00:11:20,839 --> 00:11:25,639
right place that's what they're what

259
00:11:22,278 --> 00:11:27,679
they're promoting right uh great concept

260
00:11:25,639 --> 00:11:29,879
but the problem is what's right how do

261
00:11:27,679 --> 00:11:32,078
you define what's right

262
00:11:29,879 --> 00:11:35,879
okay uh and especially when it comes to

263
00:11:32,078 --> 00:11:38,120
rate the problem is that the rate is is

264
00:11:35,879 --> 00:11:41,200
is the right rate is defined by the

265
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:44,240
other three Rs Source time place as well

266
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:46,800
as weather and many other factors okay

267
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:50,079
so it's a complicated issue just to

268
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:51,679
illustrate that it this is data from uh

269
00:11:50,078 --> 00:11:54,838
Iowa State

270
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:58,199
University uh that shows um the economic

271
00:11:54,839 --> 00:12:01,360
Optimum n rate from many n response

272
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:04,519
trials over for number of years and many

273
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:07,440
locations that shows uh quite quite a

274
00:12:04,519 --> 00:12:09,759
distribution right so one could ask the

275
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:11,720
question well what's what's the proper

276
00:12:09,759 --> 00:12:14,278
what's the correct nitrogen rate right

277
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:18,199
it's very very difficult to decide that

278
00:12:14,278 --> 00:12:20,480
it can be from 50 to 250 this core after

279
00:12:18,198 --> 00:12:22,399
soybean right so you can throw up your

280
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,920
hands you say well is there maybe

281
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:27,879
something underlying that causes this

282
00:12:24,919 --> 00:12:30,159
variability now the ISU recommendation

283
00:12:27,879 --> 00:12:33,039
is this one here around

284
00:12:30,159 --> 00:12:35,278
150 so that would mean that uh in about

285
00:12:33,039 --> 00:12:36,838
a third of the cases you would under

286
00:12:35,278 --> 00:12:40,198
fertilize in about two-third of the

287
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:42,560
cases you would over fertilize okay so

288
00:12:40,198 --> 00:12:44,000
obviously having a very generalized

289
00:12:42,559 --> 00:12:45,838
recommendations which they do I mean

290
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,159
it's remarkable the state of Iowa number

291
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:50,360
one corn State the recommendations is

292
00:12:48,159 --> 00:12:52,759
the same for every field and every year

293
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:57,519
in the state every soil type everything

294
00:12:52,759 --> 00:12:59,319
okay um we can do better than that so um

295
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:02,320
so some of the work that we did starting

296
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:05,920
maybe about 25 years ago where we uh

297
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:09,800
started to look at this uh temporal or

298
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:12,479
or weather induced variability so Jason

299
00:13:09,799 --> 00:13:14,120
kahabka uh who some of you may know as

300
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:17,278
the associate dean of the grad school

301
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:19,799
here uh he was a master student with me

302
00:13:17,278 --> 00:13:21,439
so like in one case we needed 110

303
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:24,240
kilograms per hectare in another year we

304
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:26,360
needed 220 right I mean huge differences

305
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:29,639
this is here at the musra farm in New

306
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:32,278
York Shan sbgi who was a PhD student

307
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:34,560
started to work with the Lea model and

308
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:36,639
said hey wait a minute we can kind of if

309
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:38,759
we incorporate weather information we

310
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:41,799
can sort of simulate these effects and

311
00:13:38,759 --> 00:13:43,759
that was basically the idea behind adapt

312
00:13:41,799 --> 00:13:46,759
end to say we can make better

313
00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:49,799
recommendations by incorporating these

314
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:51,838
factors so more recently some uh work

315
00:13:49,799 --> 00:13:55,240
came out of uh Illinois where they did

316
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:57,240
The Meta analysis of many site years in

317
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:59,198
the US and Eastern Canada where they

318
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:00,799
looked at you know what's the source

319
00:13:59,198 --> 00:14:03,439
main source of variability in this

320
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:06,359
economic Optimum in rate and it was

321
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:08,440
basically weather so especially

322
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:10,680
precipitation okay two3 of the

323
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:12,040
variability was weather related so you

324
00:14:10,679 --> 00:14:15,519
don't incorporate weather into your

325
00:14:12,039 --> 00:14:18,000
recommendations you miss a lot of the uh

326
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:20,078
information that's critical soil factors

327
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,399
was second about 10 to

328
00:14:20,078 --> 00:14:25,439
23% and then they said well you need to

329
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:28,000
also account for risk which of course we

330
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:29,720
had already been working on at that time

331
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,519
but it was nice to see that

332
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:34,278
confirmed you know some of the earlier

333
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:36,720
work that we did and uh justification

334
00:14:34,278 --> 00:14:37,480
for use like a that use like a tool of

335
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,519
that

336
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:42,800
then um but most of the uh

337
00:14:40,519 --> 00:14:45,480
recommendations that are being used

338
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:48,879
around the United States and actually

339
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:51,278
anywhere else in the world almost um are

340
00:14:48,879 --> 00:14:53,759
either static or there are what we might

341
00:14:51,278 --> 00:14:55,919
call Dynamic and and and adaptive so

342
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:58,320
static is basically the one that I just

343
00:14:55,919 --> 00:15:00,559
Illustrated with Iowa State the official

344
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:02,720
New York recommendations are also static

345
00:15:00,559 --> 00:15:05,559
they're relatively simplistic they don't

346
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:07,959
account for WEA uh as a source of

347
00:15:05,559 --> 00:15:10,719
variability the other category is the

348
00:15:07,958 --> 00:15:13,719
dynamic or adaptive approach it can be

349
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:16,920
soil testing like a ps&amp;t uh it can be

350
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:19,680
canopy sensors or it can be models which

351
00:15:16,919 --> 00:15:21,679
is really what the area that we sort of

352
00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:23,519
started to work in and they each have

353
00:15:21,679 --> 00:15:26,758
their pros and

354
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:28,560
cons the main question however is does

355
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:30,720
it give you a good recommendation you

356
00:15:28,559 --> 00:15:33,958
can have fancy equipment but if it

357
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:36,759
doesn't give you a good rate then what's

358
00:15:33,958 --> 00:15:39,359
the point right so you have to prove

359
00:15:36,759 --> 00:15:40,480
that the other kind of complicating

360
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:44,120
factor is that a lot of these

361
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:46,959
recommendations are based on very simple

362
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:50,639
cropping systems like corn after corn or

363
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:53,719
corn after soye okay but now we're

364
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:55,480
interested in more diverse type of

365
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:57,319
cropping systems in a sort of

366
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:59,000
multiobjective environment we're care

367
00:15:57,318 --> 00:16:01,479
about Cal Health about carbon

368
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:03,799
illustration about water quality about

369
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:06,278
energy about greenhouse gas emissions

370
00:16:03,799 --> 00:16:08,919
and so we're bringing in these more

371
00:16:06,278 --> 00:16:12,278
sustainable type cropping systems or

372
00:16:08,919 --> 00:16:14,759
regenerative uh rotations cover cropping

373
00:16:12,278 --> 00:16:17,879
uh using more organic inputs we have

374
00:16:14,759 --> 00:16:19,079
higher yielding uh crop genetics all of

375
00:16:17,879 --> 00:16:21,240
those kind of things we have better

376
00:16:19,078 --> 00:16:22,679
fertilizers right so if you just base

377
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:25,000
all your recommendations on these very

378
00:16:22,679 --> 00:16:27,318
simple systems you're missing some of

379
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:30,078
the technological uh

380
00:16:27,318 --> 00:16:32,838
Innovations so that really was the the

381
00:16:30,078 --> 00:16:36,000
whole point of adap 10 so this here

382
00:16:32,839 --> 00:16:39,440
shows the adap in as an Standalone user

383
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:42,318
interface the way uh it was originally

384
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:45,800
offered so Kevin is going to be showing

385
00:16:42,318 --> 00:16:47,919
how this technology is better integrated

386
00:16:45,799 --> 00:16:49,599
with other field management systems

387
00:16:47,919 --> 00:16:51,879
because that's what farmers are using

388
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:54,040
Farmers don't want to use a standalone

389
00:16:51,879 --> 00:16:55,720
piece of software they wanted to be part

390
00:16:54,039 --> 00:16:58,360
of another piece of software that

391
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:59,519
already has a lot of the data in there

392
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:01,120
okay

393
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:02,639
so what are some of these inputs for

394
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,519
adaptin and I'm not going to go into

395
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:07,599
details some of it is sourced

396
00:17:04,519 --> 00:17:10,240
automatically like climate data uh soils

397
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:12,519
data as well we have our own uh soil

398
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:14,759
databases and then there's user in

399
00:17:12,519 --> 00:17:17,558
inputs on basically soil and crop

400
00:17:14,759 --> 00:17:20,160
management practices right uh fertilized

401
00:17:17,558 --> 00:17:22,480
applications manure Etc but you'll see

402
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:24,400
that some of these kind of regenerative

403
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:27,000
practices are also included in that

404
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:29,000
cover cropping rotations organic

405
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,679
amendments and and all of those kind of

406
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:34,919
things very important um and then the

407
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:37,759
model basically discretizes the soil

408
00:17:34,919 --> 00:17:41,280
into layers and then it discretizes in

409
00:17:37,759 --> 00:17:44,519
time on a daily basis so uh based on uh

410
00:17:41,279 --> 00:17:46,720
daily climate data are the simulations

411
00:17:44,519 --> 00:17:49,160
that then generate a

412
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:52,400
recommendation so just quickly about

413
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:54,000
some of the results and this is uh a

414
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:56,759
graph that was actually developed by Jim

415
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:59,119
shephers from the ARs after we shared

416
00:17:56,759 --> 00:18:02,158
the data with him um and this this is

417
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:04,199
based on uh field validations where we

418
00:18:02,159 --> 00:18:07,520
had uh strips in a field where we had an

419
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:11,000
adapt end rate and we had a grower rate

420
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:12,480
whatever the grower used to apply and um

421
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:15,159
and you see on the left side of the

422
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:17,240
graph those were the uh situations where

423
00:18:15,159 --> 00:18:19,159
adapt end recommended less nitrogen than

424
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:20,880
what the grower was using and you can

425
00:18:19,159 --> 00:18:23,840
see that there was virtually no yield

426
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:25,919
loss on the average no yield loss so the

427
00:18:23,839 --> 00:18:29,240
savings were with the fertilizer that

428
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:33,000
was 83% of the cases in the remaining

429
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:35,240
70% of the cases we uh adapt and

430
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,038
recommended more than the grower but it

431
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:39,640
was justified by a yield

432
00:18:37,038 --> 00:18:41,480
increase okay so this is kind of the

433
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:44,080
situation that that you want in most

434
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:47,000
cases you reduce your end rate but you

435
00:18:44,079 --> 00:18:48,519
acknowledge that especially in wet years

436
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,119
you may actually need a little bit more

437
00:18:48,519 --> 00:18:53,519
nitrogen but overall you can actually

438
00:18:51,119 --> 00:18:55,399
have considerable benefits in terms of

439
00:18:53,519 --> 00:18:57,918
profits both in terms of saving a

440
00:18:55,400 --> 00:19:00,000
fertilizer or avoid avoiding yield

441
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:03,600
losses

442
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:05,679
in terms of the environmental losses um

443
00:19:03,599 --> 00:19:07,000
we you can simply by using a more

444
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:08,600
precise recommendations you can

445
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:11,640
significantly use your environmental

446
00:19:08,599 --> 00:19:14,959
losses so on the left is uh is leeching

447
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:18,080
losses any of the dots above the one to

448
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:20,519
one line meant that there was a

449
00:19:18,079 --> 00:19:24,158
reduction in leeching losses from adap

450
00:19:20,519 --> 00:19:25,720
10 relative to uh Growers and the same

451
00:19:24,159 --> 00:19:30,640
on the right side with the gaseous

452
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:33,240
losses so 36 to 39% reductions simply by

453
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:35,720
not over fertilizing basically in in a

454
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:37,038
vast majority of of the cases without

455
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:40,319
any yield

456
00:19:37,038 --> 00:19:42,919
losses so we also did uh work with some

457
00:19:40,319 --> 00:19:46,240
third parties uh notably University of

458
00:19:42,919 --> 00:19:49,600
Nebraska has a great uh on Farm uh trial

459
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:52,440
Network really fantastic um and so they

460
00:19:49,599 --> 00:19:55,079
were interested in testing adap then and

461
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:57,480
uh so you can see on the left there um

462
00:19:55,079 --> 00:19:58,839
that uh for one of the field they had

463
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:01,079
several of the fields I'm just showing

464
00:19:58,839 --> 00:20:03,038
for for one field at adapt end

465
00:20:01,079 --> 00:20:05,639
recommended a much lower rate than the

466
00:20:03,038 --> 00:20:07,240
canopy sensor or the what the grower was

467
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:08,960
using but you can see that the yields

468
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:12,440
are basically the same so that's a good

469
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:15,200
situation right same yield with less

470
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:17,200
nitrogen um they also did some multi-

471
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:19,679
rate uh trials where you can determine

472
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:24,080
the economic Optimum end rate and they

473
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:25,640
compared adap 10 with uh grower uh

474
00:20:24,079 --> 00:20:29,359
another commercial product that's now

475
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:30,600
off the market from Cava uh and then

476
00:20:29,359 --> 00:20:33,759
uh University of Nebraska

477
00:20:30,599 --> 00:20:36,000
recommendations and you can see that

478
00:20:33,759 --> 00:20:38,000
adap ended very well in terms of

479
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:42,119
following that onetoone line which is

480
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:44,759
really uh what you want to do so um so

481
00:20:42,119 --> 00:20:45,918
it's been nice to have third parties do

482
00:20:44,759 --> 00:20:48,119
some

483
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:51,320
evaluations okay before I hand it over

484
00:20:48,119 --> 00:20:54,038
to Kevin uh wanted to maybe talk about

485
00:20:51,319 --> 00:20:56,439
some of the learnings from doing this so

486
00:20:54,038 --> 00:20:58,960
having a product and and integrating it

487
00:20:56,440 --> 00:21:02,000
with commercial software so first first

488
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:05,000
commercialization is critical adapt end

489
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:07,679
would be dead died on the vine if we

490
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:10,798
didn't license it and partner with the

491
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:13,080
commercial Company software integration

492
00:21:10,798 --> 00:21:15,720
as Kevin will show is critical for

493
00:21:13,079 --> 00:21:18,798
scaling you want Farmers to use it you

494
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:21,839
got to you got to you got to integrate

495
00:21:18,798 --> 00:21:24,240
it with other software systems and these

496
00:21:21,839 --> 00:21:27,119
cloud-based uh software end Solutions

497
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:28,960
have very distinct advantages especially

498
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:30,399
when it comes to scaling it's Rel you

499
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:32,880
don't need to buy equipment or anything

500
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:36,120
like that you can scale it up relatively

501
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:39,600
quickly so specifically for adap

502
00:21:36,119 --> 00:21:41,599
in um Yara when it was still within Yara

503
00:21:39,599 --> 00:21:43,959
did an the marketing department did a

504
00:21:41,599 --> 00:21:45,519
survey of adap 10 users and the number

505
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:47,558
one thing that they really valued was

506
00:21:45,519 --> 00:21:50,278
the scientific validity it does matter

507
00:21:47,558 --> 00:21:52,558
to them there's a lot of stuff out there

508
00:21:50,278 --> 00:21:55,240
very muddy waters but they like the

509
00:21:52,558 --> 00:21:58,918
scientific validity the customer turn

510
00:21:55,240 --> 00:22:01,278
rate is uh relatively low so most people

511
00:21:58,919 --> 00:22:04,240
that start to use it app then want to

512
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:05,880
keep using it they don't say doesn't

513
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:08,798
work and they throw it to the site so

514
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:11,400
that's good um third party providers

515
00:22:08,798 --> 00:22:14,639
offer additional scaling so both Yara

516
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:16,960
and now ever do work with what are

517
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:19,559
basically competitors and say they make

518
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:22,000
they will make adap in available uh to

519
00:22:19,558 --> 00:22:24,798
them so that's you have that additional

520
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,519
scaling and then uh and this my my

521
00:22:24,798 --> 00:22:29,000
experience is that the the the public

522
00:22:26,519 --> 00:22:31,119
sector really struggles with this kind

523
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,798
of Technology they like the old

524
00:22:31,119 --> 00:22:35,558
recommendation systems that are very

525
00:22:32,798 --> 00:22:38,798
simple and then you have much more

526
00:22:35,558 --> 00:22:41,000
Innovative improved technology and uh

527
00:22:38,798 --> 00:22:43,278
both within the landr university system

528
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:45,480
as well as like state agencies they

529
00:22:43,278 --> 00:22:48,798
don't really know how to deal with that

530
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:50,640
and uh and so that's uh that's a topic

531
00:22:48,798 --> 00:22:53,759
for another discussion at some point in

532
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:56,200
time anyway uh so with that I now I'm

533
00:22:53,759 --> 00:22:58,798
going to hand it over to Kevin who is in

534
00:22:56,200 --> 00:23:01,840
Minnesota and he's going to do a

535
00:22:58,798 --> 00:23:04,599
demonstration of the adapt end tool

536
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:06,639
within the field allytics uh field

537
00:23:04,599 --> 00:23:10,639
management software system so within

538
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:11,880
their their platform okay uh Kevin uh

539
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:14,720
you can take

540
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:16,880
over go ahead and start sharing

541
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:19,519
excellent thank you Harold um appreciate

542
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:21,400
the time appreciate the invite to

543
00:23:19,519 --> 00:23:23,079
present field allytics and the

544
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:27,200
integration of adapt and into field a

545
00:23:23,079 --> 00:23:28,960
lytics um to this group uh little bit

546
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:32,159
the history

547
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:35,759
that I have um that I think is is

548
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:38,159
important in my role today is I spent 25

549
00:23:35,759 --> 00:23:40,839
years in production agriculture in the

550
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:44,039
retail setting um started off out of

551
00:23:40,839 --> 00:23:47,759
college have a BS in geography with GIS

552
00:23:44,038 --> 00:23:51,000
started off with a crop consultant um

553
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:52,558
teaching basically University extension

554
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:55,359
people throughout the United States on

555
00:23:52,558 --> 00:23:57,440
how GPS is going to work in tractors how

556
00:23:55,359 --> 00:23:59,158
it's going to work in combines and and

557
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:01,960
how the data is going to be used so I've

558
00:23:59,159 --> 00:24:05,200
been in this game um quite a long time

559
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:07,640
and the thing that I always um been

560
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:09,400
working towards is efficiencies how do

561
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:13,520
we make the tool more efficient so we

562
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:16,519
can get it to more people and that that

563
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:20,278
is one of the drivers on why I um left

564
00:24:16,519 --> 00:24:22,519
retail and went to Yara with adap Den um

565
00:24:20,278 --> 00:24:27,200
back in April of

566
00:24:22,519 --> 00:24:29,000
2023 um my goal was is to help them

567
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:30,840
understand retail better

568
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:35,519
understand the grower at the farm gate

569
00:24:30,839 --> 00:24:37,278
better so we could build a tool that

570
00:24:35,519 --> 00:24:41,200
could help with a lot of the issues that

571
00:24:37,278 --> 00:24:43,119
Harold talked about and the the thing

572
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:44,919
that really hits home is is Harold

573
00:24:43,119 --> 00:24:49,119
mentioned the

574
00:24:44,919 --> 00:24:50,759
eonr and we in universities and and you

575
00:24:49,119 --> 00:24:53,759
and people who are researching we

576
00:24:50,759 --> 00:24:55,440
understand that nitrogen is is finicky

577
00:24:53,759 --> 00:24:57,679
right but when you try to convince a

578
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:59,240
grower that they need to cut 40 to 50 to

579
00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:01,640
60 pounds an nitrogen out of their

580
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:03,359
program It's A Hard Sell um they'd

581
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:05,520
rather pay the money for the extra

582
00:25:03,359 --> 00:25:07,319
nitrogen to not have the yield loss so

583
00:25:05,519 --> 00:25:09,480
we're working in conjunction trying to

584
00:25:07,319 --> 00:25:12,398
to help ease some of that pain and and

585
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:15,278
this tool has really opened up a lot of

586
00:25:12,398 --> 00:25:17,319
eyes but we need to get to a lot more so

587
00:25:15,278 --> 00:25:20,200
if there's 96 million acres of corn in

588
00:25:17,319 --> 00:25:23,720
the United States today we're running in

589
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:25,840
about 500,000 Acres of that so we're not

590
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:28,798
even you know the tip of the iceberg

591
00:25:25,839 --> 00:25:31,038
here on the number of fields and Farms

592
00:25:28,798 --> 00:25:35,798
that we can touch and help manage

593
00:25:31,038 --> 00:25:37,599
nitrogen better and um and for the

594
00:25:35,798 --> 00:25:39,240
industry for the environment for

595
00:25:37,599 --> 00:25:41,199
everything it's it's the right thing to

596
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:43,480
do and that's why I'm excited to take

597
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:46,558
this job with ever

598
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:49,759
egg as a product manager is now I'm

599
00:25:46,558 --> 00:25:52,278
helping the developers and our modelers

600
00:25:49,759 --> 00:25:53,519
make things more efficient um and put

601
00:25:52,278 --> 00:25:55,038
into this software so I'm just going to

602
00:25:53,519 --> 00:25:57,879
give you a little rundown of the

603
00:25:55,038 --> 00:26:00,038
software usually our software demos take

604
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:02,720
two sometimes three hours depending on

605
00:26:00,038 --> 00:26:05,879
questions so forgive me I'm going to

606
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:07,558
condense this into 20 minutes and um you

607
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:10,640
know do the best I can in that 20

608
00:26:07,558 --> 00:26:13,240
minutes so basically the software this

609
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:15,480
is a we call it an fmis a farm

610
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:17,359
management information system it's not a

611
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:19,960
true GIS because I can't write scripts

612
00:26:17,359 --> 00:26:22,439
in it I can't do a lot of third party

613
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:24,038
stuff but but we have grower farms and

614
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:25,440
Fields and this would be what a typical

615
00:26:24,038 --> 00:26:28,000
retailer would look like where they

616
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:29,880
would have different locations and then

617
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,519
they would have within that location

618
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:33,159
they would have Growers and then a

619
00:26:31,519 --> 00:26:35,599
grower would have farms and I'm going to

620
00:26:33,159 --> 00:26:39,000
just share this my little demo Farm here

621
00:26:35,599 --> 00:26:41,719
that I Call KOA adop in So within that I

622
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:45,159
have I have a handful of different Farms

623
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:48,120
that I manage and I'm looking at and if

624
00:26:45,159 --> 00:26:49,640
I were a a retail agronomist or a grower

625
00:26:48,119 --> 00:26:51,879
that had access to this and I wanted to

626
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:54,080
look at my Farms I I could come to this

627
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:56,278
dashboard and I could pull up this

628
00:26:54,079 --> 00:26:58,759
dashboard and quickly look through what

629
00:26:56,278 --> 00:27:01,558
are my nitrogen needs for today so this

630
00:26:58,759 --> 00:27:03,720
RX is giving me a A Min average and Max

631
00:27:01,558 --> 00:27:05,359
nitrogen need for each of these fields

632
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:08,480
so I can see this Field's calling for

633
00:27:05,359 --> 00:27:11,719
137 pounds of nitrogen today this Fields

634
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:14,360
98 pounds this Fields 130 pounds and I

635
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:16,480
can I can click around and I can open up

636
00:27:14,359 --> 00:27:18,918
the map and it'll Zoom to the map and I

637
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:21,679
can see what what encompasses that

638
00:27:18,919 --> 00:27:23,720
recommendation I can look through uh I

639
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:26,240
can click on a cell and it'll tell me

640
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:30,038
what is needed I can look over here and

641
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:32,440
see that um on the right side I can see

642
00:27:30,038 --> 00:27:34,720
a a few of the metrics for that field

643
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:37,120
such as planning date rainfall since

644
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:40,919
planting and again this is current day

645
00:27:37,119 --> 00:27:42,558
so we're looking at all the information

646
00:27:40,919 --> 00:27:44,720
set up I can see I don't have any

647
00:27:42,558 --> 00:27:47,558
applications set on this field and I got

648
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:50,399
a little bit left to do but this is this

649
00:27:47,558 --> 00:27:52,158
is the area that um the retail

650
00:27:50,398 --> 00:27:54,239
agronomist or the crop consultant will

651
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:56,399
spend they'll come in here on a daily

652
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:58,558
basis and look or you know when it's

653
00:27:56,398 --> 00:28:00,079
that when it's on schedule to say I need

654
00:27:58,558 --> 00:28:01,519
to see what's going on in these fields

655
00:28:00,079 --> 00:28:02,480
they'll come here just to see where

656
00:28:01,519 --> 00:28:07,159
that's

657
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:11,480
at the real the real power of this tool

658
00:28:07,159 --> 00:28:13,919
is um having an integration with field

659
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:16,720
allytics is the ability to batch process

660
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:19,519
or do batch things in batch so I'm going

661
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:22,360
to just come back out here to my grower

662
00:28:19,519 --> 00:28:24,640
level and I'm going to come in here to

663
00:28:22,359 --> 00:28:26,359
configure fields on adapt end so the

664
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:29,320
first thing I can do every field that I

665
00:28:26,359 --> 00:28:32,158
have a check mark in I already enrolled

666
00:28:29,319 --> 00:28:33,759
into the program so if I if I have a

667
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:35,640
grower come and say I need I want to

668
00:28:33,759 --> 00:28:37,480
enroll these three Fields I can come in

669
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:39,919
here I can say click that I can hit

670
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:41,798
enroll what it does then is it starts to

671
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:43,799
process and sends that through the API

672
00:28:41,798 --> 00:28:45,679
to the adapt end model it starts

673
00:28:43,798 --> 00:28:48,278
building out the soil types the

674
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:50,919
autogenerated um layers that Harold was

675
00:28:48,278 --> 00:28:53,679
talking about um our goal in the future

676
00:28:50,919 --> 00:28:55,519
is to make more layers automated and as

677
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:57,278
I click through some of these layers I

678
00:28:55,519 --> 00:28:58,679
you you'll get an idea of how we might

679
00:28:57,278 --> 00:29:01,319
want to do that

680
00:28:58,679 --> 00:29:02,640
but that's the start of that and I'm not

681
00:29:01,319 --> 00:29:05,798
going to hit enrolled because I don't

682
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:08,038
want to enroll any extra Acres that

683
00:29:05,798 --> 00:29:09,359
aren't enrolled because it um it will

684
00:29:08,038 --> 00:29:13,720
trigger an

685
00:29:09,359 --> 00:29:16,599
invoice so once I have the fields um

686
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:21,000
enrolled then I can start to I can start

687
00:29:16,599 --> 00:29:23,599
to um configure them so I can just pick

688
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:26,319
a couple Fields here and I can go into

689
00:29:23,599 --> 00:29:27,839
configure selected so now what I'm doing

690
00:29:26,319 --> 00:29:30,000
is I have these two fields that I have

691
00:29:27,839 --> 00:29:32,720
not configured yet I I have them in a

692
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:35,599
rle but I haven't configured I can come

693
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:37,880
in and I can do them individually or I

694
00:29:35,599 --> 00:29:40,480
can do them in a batch so I can say okay

695
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:43,919
my expected yield on these fields is 225

696
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:46,079
bushels I'm going to have 105 day corn

697
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:48,480
and I plan to plant somewhere around

698
00:29:46,079 --> 00:29:48,480
April

699
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:55,360
15th so I can look at an individually I

700
00:29:52,759 --> 00:29:57,480
can come back in after the fact and say

701
00:29:55,359 --> 00:30:00,959
okay I actually didn't get into this

702
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:03,640
field until April 20th so now I can just

703
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:06,200
change that I can also load different

704
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:10,640
yield management zones so on and so

705
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:13,319
forth but it's it's really easy to

706
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:17,000
create a system where you

707
00:30:13,319 --> 00:30:19,480
can um multiple do multiple fields and

708
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:22,000
this is I could go 10 Fields I could go

709
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:23,519
20 Fields I could do his whole farm at

710
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,798
this

711
00:30:23,519 --> 00:30:29,640
level so that that's really a powerful

712
00:30:26,798 --> 00:30:32,319
thing that we we had some of that in the

713
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:34,799
past but not to this level so this

714
00:30:32,319 --> 00:30:36,319
allows us to batch process and enroll

715
00:30:34,798 --> 00:30:40,359
multiple fields at

716
00:30:36,319 --> 00:30:43,599
once for for the purpose of showing you

717
00:30:40,359 --> 00:30:45,319
some uh transparency and and get more

718
00:30:43,599 --> 00:30:46,959
granular with the data I'm going to I'm

719
00:30:45,319 --> 00:30:48,879
going to zoom into just one field and

720
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:51,120
I'm going to spend most of my time that

721
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:54,519
I have on on this one

722
00:30:51,119 --> 00:30:57,158
field so the power of having an

723
00:30:54,519 --> 00:31:00,319
integration and using the API to Shell

724
00:30:57,159 --> 00:31:02,919
out to adapt to to grab that information

725
00:31:00,319 --> 00:31:05,720
that nitrogen rck is it allows all of

726
00:31:02,919 --> 00:31:08,480
the data to be in one space so a lot of

727
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:11,079
the issues that I had as a user of adapt

728
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:13,679
end when I was back in retail and a lot

729
00:31:11,079 --> 00:31:17,398
of the customer feedback that we get is

730
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:19,440
that there there are times when you

731
00:31:17,398 --> 00:31:21,158
don't want to leave a software I don't

732
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:22,639
want to come in here and take my yield

733
00:31:21,159 --> 00:31:25,278
data and Export it I don't want to

734
00:31:22,638 --> 00:31:27,359
export my soil test cuz it's all export

735
00:31:25,278 --> 00:31:30,079
import and you're touching things a lot

736
00:31:27,359 --> 00:31:32,158
of times that you won't have to so if

737
00:31:30,079 --> 00:31:34,439
you have this system where everything is

738
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:37,600
sitting then you can start to configure

739
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:39,840
the field um

740
00:31:37,599 --> 00:31:41,678
individually so I can come in here and I

741
00:31:39,839 --> 00:31:44,278
can look and say okay what's my expected

742
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:47,360
yield so on this particular field I'm

743
00:31:44,278 --> 00:31:49,960
using a a yield potential layer that I

744
00:31:47,359 --> 00:31:54,558
created off of a normalized yield yield

745
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:56,440
map so I can I can assign different

746
00:31:54,558 --> 00:31:59,440
yield goals to it here or I can take

747
00:31:56,440 --> 00:32:01,480
what the what the data is in my tree

748
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:02,880
then I start to look at population so

749
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:04,679
this field they didn't have a variable

750
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:07,760
rate planter so he just put one flat

751
00:32:04,679 --> 00:32:10,480
population in it I can look at the prior

752
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:12,519
crop I can change the tillage method

753
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:15,639
organic matter so I'm using my most

754
00:32:12,519 --> 00:32:17,798
recent soil test Point um I can put in

755
00:32:15,638 --> 00:32:21,798
an emerging State when that crop came up

756
00:32:17,798 --> 00:32:24,359
this field was planted May 18th I or Mar

757
00:32:21,798 --> 00:32:26,319
yeah May 18th and it took a while we we

758
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:28,918
were very wet this spring in southern

759
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:30,960
Minnesota um I can add a cover crop if

760
00:32:28,919 --> 00:32:33,759
there was a cover crop to it so on and

761
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:36,558
so forth so so this screen gives us a

762
00:32:33,759 --> 00:32:40,038
lot of Versatility once all that is

763
00:32:36,558 --> 00:32:43,359
entered it sends the data on its way and

764
00:32:40,038 --> 00:32:45,398
then a wreck comes back and in season

765
00:32:43,359 --> 00:32:49,000
this wreck will update

766
00:32:45,398 --> 00:32:52,119
daily but we shut this off around August

767
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:55,558
15th August 30th um just because people

768
00:32:52,119 --> 00:32:58,839
are not applying nitrogen after that day

769
00:32:55,558 --> 00:33:02,440
so if I look at this particular field

770
00:32:58,839 --> 00:33:04,599
I can see what the setup is so May 13th

771
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:08,558
was the planting date I had full

772
00:33:04,599 --> 00:33:12,319
emergence on May 28th I've had 23.4 Ines

773
00:33:08,558 --> 00:33:16,879
of rain since since uh planting

774
00:33:12,319 --> 00:33:18,200
estimated growth stage this stops at BT

775
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:20,480
so one thing that we're looking for in

776
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:23,120
the future is how do we how do we expand

777
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:25,120
this out into the r stages um and does

778
00:33:23,119 --> 00:33:28,439
that make sense or do we just stop it at

779
00:33:25,119 --> 00:33:31,638
VT and and that's it um what is the

780
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:33,558
maturity class prior crop tillage then

781
00:33:31,638 --> 00:33:37,278
we look at organic matter so this field

782
00:33:33,558 --> 00:33:39,319
has an organic matter range from 1.4 to

783
00:33:37,278 --> 00:33:42,919
13.5 welcome to

784
00:33:39,319 --> 00:33:45,319
Minnesota um that this is a very this is

785
00:33:42,919 --> 00:33:49,159
not abnormal in the region that I work

786
00:33:45,319 --> 00:33:50,839
in so we work a lot with different um

787
00:33:49,159 --> 00:33:52,039
organic matters and that's important

788
00:33:50,839 --> 00:33:53,918
because it's a

789
00:33:52,038 --> 00:33:55,440
mineralization factor that a lot of

790
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:56,720
people don't take into account when

791
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:58,440
they're when they're figuring their

792
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:00,440
nitrogen programs

793
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:04,278
then our yield targets so this is what I

794
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:06,840
want to hit on why why one of the major

795
00:34:04,278 --> 00:34:08,960
reasons why the integration with everg

796
00:34:06,839 --> 00:34:12,319
and field allytics is is is big for

797
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:13,878
adapt end so here I have a yield Target

798
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:16,280
right everybody has a yield goal going

799
00:34:13,878 --> 00:34:18,440
into the season but it's not always

800
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:20,240
attained due to environmental factors

801
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:23,119
that you can't control as Herald

802
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:25,719
touchdown so if I start this year and I

803
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:27,399
got a 266 bushel yield goal which is

804
00:34:25,719 --> 00:34:30,439
field has attained that it's been in the

805
00:34:27,398 --> 00:34:33,118
two 60s um it's not it's not

806
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:34,760
unreasonable to have that goal to start

807
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:37,119
but then I start to think about all

808
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:38,800
right I didn't start PL I didn't plant

809
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:42,200
this field until May

810
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:45,879
13th um it had kind of a slow emergence

811
00:34:42,199 --> 00:34:50,598
it was cool and wet this spring so how

812
00:34:45,878 --> 00:34:52,279
can I justify changing that rate well

813
00:34:50,599 --> 00:34:55,039
there's a couple different ways that we

814
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:57,800
can do it and and it depends on what

815
00:34:55,039 --> 00:34:59,920
your Agronomy philosophy is my my

816
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:01,960
Agronomy philosophy is is I'm going to

817
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:04,240
look at historical data to see what did

818
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:05,880
this achieve with similar years so

819
00:35:04,239 --> 00:35:09,239
there's different ways that you can look

820
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:13,200
to see what was similar what was not one

821
00:35:09,239 --> 00:35:15,159
of the tools that adapt in has um that

822
00:35:13,199 --> 00:35:17,799
we can run in the old user interface is

823
00:35:15,159 --> 00:35:21,118
a multi-year comparison so what this

824
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:22,200
shows us is what were my nitrogen needs

825
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:24,280
for this

826
00:35:22,199 --> 00:35:27,199
field the

827
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:29,240
past the past years that it was corn

828
00:35:27,199 --> 00:35:32,000
because I just wanted to to simplify it

829
00:35:29,239 --> 00:35:33,799
a little bit I can go back to 20 2010

830
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:36,880
and do every year but I skipped a few

831
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:39,760
years and I wanted to look and see okay

832
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:42,559
what's similar so this 2018 seems pretty

833
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:45,320
similar to what 2014 is for loss

834
00:35:42,559 --> 00:35:47,159
recommendation and rainfall so then I

835
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:49,720
start to look at my data and say okay

836
00:35:47,159 --> 00:35:52,960
what happened in 2018 in this field and

837
00:35:49,719 --> 00:35:56,358
I can load up the 2018 yield data and I

838
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:58,159
can look at this and say hm well I had

839
00:35:56,358 --> 00:36:00,880
170 bushel yield

840
00:35:58,159 --> 00:36:04,598
average and I had quite a few areas here

841
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:07,720
that this this spot here was 89 bushel

842
00:36:04,599 --> 00:36:10,200
this spot was 63 bushels over here on

843
00:36:07,719 --> 00:36:13,759
this little sand on this little wet hole

844
00:36:10,199 --> 00:36:15,358
was 93 bushels I did I did obtain some

845
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:18,920
okay yields

846
00:36:15,358 --> 00:36:22,318
215 200 so my first thought is is I am

847
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:25,960
going to reassign my yield um estimates

848
00:36:22,318 --> 00:36:27,960
because the 266 bushel is not accurate

849
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:30,199
or realistic

850
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:32,280
so how do I do that well I could take

851
00:36:30,199 --> 00:36:34,519
this past Year's yield data but I don't

852
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:35,960
really want to do that because it's not

853
00:36:34,519 --> 00:36:38,280
exactly what's going to happen this year

854
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:40,199
so I'm I'm going to go back to inseason

855
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:41,480
imagery so what I'm going to do is I'm

856
00:36:40,199 --> 00:36:44,078
going to come in here and I'm going to

857
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:47,400
look through my inseason imagery so

858
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:50,240
imagine with me it's it's July 15th and

859
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:52,680
the Corn's about v18 V16 and I'm going

860
00:36:50,239 --> 00:36:54,318
to Y drop it so what I would do is I

861
00:36:52,679 --> 00:36:56,679
would come in and find the most recent

862
00:36:54,318 --> 00:36:59,639
image closest to that day obviously if

863
00:36:56,679 --> 00:37:02,118
it's July 15th none of these would be

864
00:36:59,639 --> 00:37:04,199
populated yet so I'll look at this July

865
00:37:02,119 --> 00:37:07,480
12th

866
00:37:04,199 --> 00:37:10,039
image and when that image comes up it's

867
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:14,119
going to show me the ndvi so now I can

868
00:37:10,039 --> 00:37:17,079
see what is my crop Vigor in those spots

869
00:37:14,119 --> 00:37:20,559
and I can tell I've got almost crop

870
00:37:17,079 --> 00:37:22,200
failure or really poor

871
00:37:20,559 --> 00:37:25,639
um

872
00:37:22,199 --> 00:37:28,799
Leaf reflectant in those areas so I can

873
00:37:25,639 --> 00:37:31,318
assume that these are poor yielding

874
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:32,920
areas I could also go out and Scout that

875
00:37:31,318 --> 00:37:35,639
I can send this to the field of litics

876
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:38,400
mobile app I can look at this image as I

877
00:37:35,639 --> 00:37:41,118
go out there and I can verify on foot as

878
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:42,920
well if that's the issue so I'm going to

879
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:44,240
use this layer so what I'm going to do

880
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:47,240
is I'm going to create a new yield

881
00:37:44,239 --> 00:37:49,479
potential for it and and I would come

882
00:37:47,239 --> 00:37:52,759
into this tool and say create yield

883
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:55,599
potential and I'm going to call it

884
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:59,240
uh July

885
00:37:55,599 --> 00:38:01,920
12th yield adjustment

886
00:37:59,239 --> 00:38:03,799
and I have to tell what commodity I'm on

887
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:06,800
SO corn

888
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:08,720
field and bushell's breaker so it's

889
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:11,400
taking these numbers from a database

890
00:38:08,719 --> 00:38:15,598
that that ever EG has generated off of

891
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:17,119
Nas data based on historic yields so

892
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:20,280
it's saying in this field the range is

893
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:24,519
going to be from 178 to 276 on a normal

894
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:26,800
year on an average year so I create that

895
00:38:24,519 --> 00:38:29,440
and then I can come in and look at that

896
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:29,440
created

897
00:38:35,719 --> 00:38:40,239
takes just a minute as it rasterizes

898
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,239
that

899
00:38:53,639 --> 00:38:59,318
data so now I have this yield estimation

900
00:38:56,480 --> 00:39:01,000
layer and I I can edit that as well so

901
00:38:59,318 --> 00:39:04,159
because it's going off of averages and I

902
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:06,079
don't feel that I'm above average or at

903
00:39:04,159 --> 00:39:07,799
average so I can do that two different

904
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:11,240
ways I'm going to take this back to what

905
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:13,640
I feel is appropriate for That season so

906
00:39:11,239 --> 00:39:16,759
now I'm going to go average yeld 210 and

907
00:39:13,639 --> 00:39:19,639
my range is going to be from 134 to 232

908
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:22,560
so I can submit that

909
00:39:19,639 --> 00:39:24,920
and now I've got a yield potential layer

910
00:39:22,559 --> 00:39:27,440
that I can load into adap n that will

911
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:29,559
change the rre accordingly based on the

912
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:32,720
those yield

913
00:39:29,559 --> 00:39:34,920
estimates so I come back into the adapt

914
00:39:32,719 --> 00:39:37,480
end

915
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:39,318
configuration and under expected yield

916
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:41,440
I'm going to unlock that

917
00:39:39,318 --> 00:39:43,279
layer and I'm going to change my

918
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:47,280
expected yield to average to

919
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:49,720
210 and I'm going to use that July 12th

920
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:53,079
yield adjustment

921
00:39:49,719 --> 00:39:55,118
number and it's going to give me values

922
00:39:53,079 --> 00:39:57,880
that look like this and I'm going to say

923
00:39:55,119 --> 00:40:00,039
this hole because I went out and scouted

924
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:03,440
is not going to be 143 belel I'm going

925
00:40:00,039 --> 00:40:05,480
to take that down to 120 bushel and

926
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:07,079
these areas over here I also looked at

927
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:09,079
those because I didn't feel that those

928
00:40:07,079 --> 00:40:11,560
were and I'm going to take those to 150

929
00:40:09,079 --> 00:40:15,160
so you can be it gives you gives the

930
00:40:11,559 --> 00:40:18,719
agronomist the opportunity to

931
00:40:15,159 --> 00:40:21,440
um change things on the fly as they see

932
00:40:18,719 --> 00:40:23,239
fit they might say where the field that

933
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:25,039
where it's good is really good and and

934
00:40:23,239 --> 00:40:27,559
then you could change that to

935
00:40:25,039 --> 00:40:31,400
245 um you know whatever you felt that

936
00:40:27,559 --> 00:40:34,519
number was so then you save that

937
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:38,240
configuration and now what is doing is

938
00:40:34,519 --> 00:40:41,039
hitting the API sending that data

939
00:40:38,239 --> 00:40:42,598
to um the adapt

940
00:40:41,039 --> 00:40:45,159
n

941
00:40:42,599 --> 00:40:46,960
model and it takes just a minute because

942
00:40:45,159 --> 00:40:50,480
it's it's a you know

943
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:52,039
it's this is it tells me that my

944
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:54,800
configuration was complete and that

945
00:40:52,039 --> 00:40:57,400
adapt end accepted the the configuration

946
00:40:54,800 --> 00:41:00,720
changes so then it usually takes about 2

947
00:40:57,400 --> 00:41:02,760
minutes for it to come back so in those

948
00:41:00,719 --> 00:41:04,318
two minutes you know I I'll go to

949
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:07,560
another field I'll look at something

950
00:41:04,318 --> 00:41:08,880
else on this maybe look at some

951
00:41:07,559 --> 00:41:11,719
statistics

952
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:15,119
or try and figure out what my next step

953
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:15,118
is with with

954
00:41:19,039 --> 00:41:24,559
that like I said it it the calculations

955
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:29,240
there's quite a few calculations that

956
00:41:24,559 --> 00:41:32,639
are being done on it um it's no slower

957
00:41:29,239 --> 00:41:36,519
than if we were in the user interface um

958
00:41:32,639 --> 00:41:36,519
working within the model

959
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:45,480
itself so I'll just give it a minute um

960
00:41:41,519 --> 00:41:47,358
the other things that that are really

961
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:51,318
great about being integrated is the

962
00:41:47,358 --> 00:41:54,000
transparency so I can look at um my soil

963
00:41:51,318 --> 00:41:56,000
test I can look at my phes and I can

964
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:58,079
make that I can make a decision if I

965
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,679
want to add pH to the the model or not

966
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:02,760
some of our users will add it

967
00:41:59,679 --> 00:42:05,239
automatically others might say uh pretty

968
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:07,040
neutral I'm not I'm not going to mess

969
00:42:05,239 --> 00:42:09,559
around with it it's just another

970
00:42:07,039 --> 00:42:11,358
variable so you know you could look at

971
00:42:09,559 --> 00:42:13,480
this and say okay in this sand area here

972
00:42:11,358 --> 00:42:16,400
I've got some pretty high phes i' I

973
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:19,920
might want to add my pH to the

974
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:22,160
configuration if I haven't already um so

975
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:25,800
there's different different advantages

976
00:42:22,159 --> 00:42:27,879
of being in all the data in one as

977
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:30,318
applied data so anything that's applied

978
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:33,720
to the field if the if the controller is

979
00:42:30,318 --> 00:42:36,318
hooked up to field alytic then the data

980
00:42:33,719 --> 00:42:40,439
will come back into the software so we

981
00:42:36,318 --> 00:42:43,719
have access to everything um in one

982
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:43,720
spot and

983
00:42:56,119 --> 00:43:02,119
again so you can see part of it is back

984
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:04,079
because the yield has changed to 217

985
00:43:02,119 --> 00:43:07,800
because I changed those high that high

986
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:10,640
level to 245 but the wreck still is

987
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:10,640
still is on its

988
00:43:12,719 --> 00:43:17,399
way but we can use what we have and I

989
00:43:15,199 --> 00:43:19,439
can come back to that so the user then

990
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:21,920
would would then the next step would be

991
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:24,400
to pull up the PDF off of the field and

992
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:27,480
what this tells tells us is what's going

993
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:30,880
on in this field what is happening that

994
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:32,599
would make that recommendation 91 pounds

995
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:34,720
and so you can see the range of total

996
00:43:32,599 --> 00:43:40,119
end loss so we can look throughout the

997
00:43:34,719 --> 00:43:42,279
season on what our losses are from the

998
00:43:40,119 --> 00:43:44,559
men and the Max and the

999
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:47,040
average then I can break that down into

1000
00:43:44,559 --> 00:43:49,400
a gas loss or a leeching loss so I

1001
00:43:47,039 --> 00:43:51,759
didn't have a lot of gas loss this year

1002
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:53,240
most of my loss came from the leeching

1003
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:57,880
state

1004
00:43:53,239 --> 00:44:00,039
um which is normal to the of moisture we

1005
00:43:57,880 --> 00:44:03,760
had so here I'm looking at the Field

1006
00:44:00,039 --> 00:44:05,679
capacity um of moisture and you can see

1007
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:09,400
how the up and down throughout the

1008
00:44:05,679 --> 00:44:13,598
season um and we were wet most of the

1009
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:15,639
Year up until probably early July um

1010
00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:17,480
then it dried out and we finally got

1011
00:44:15,639 --> 00:44:21,598
back into the fields uh there probably

1012
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:24,679
wasn't a wheel turn spraying or um side

1013
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:29,119
dressing in southern Minnesota from June

1014
00:44:24,679 --> 00:44:32,519
10th to July 4th um just that much rain

1015
00:44:29,119 --> 00:44:34,960
um so here's you know the different

1016
00:44:32,519 --> 00:44:37,400
graphs that we we look at so the grower

1017
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:39,119
and the and the agronomist can can see

1018
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:43,119
what's happening to this field why are

1019
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:45,720
we getting that if we have fall um

1020
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:47,640
application of ammonia then we look at

1021
00:44:45,719 --> 00:44:49,519
okay what's mineralizing where are we

1022
00:44:47,639 --> 00:44:52,199
getting some winter losses are we

1023
00:44:49,519 --> 00:44:55,199
getting you know was it warm here so we

1024
00:44:52,199 --> 00:44:57,199
can see this is not normal for Minnesota

1025
00:44:55,199 --> 00:44:59,039
in this February March time frame to

1026
00:44:57,199 --> 00:45:02,318
have averages of

1027
00:44:59,039 --> 00:45:06,039
50° consistently usually it's it's down

1028
00:45:02,318 --> 00:45:09,279
here we only have this one cold spell

1029
00:45:06,039 --> 00:45:10,960
January February this year so uh for for

1030
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:13,119
winter lovers it was kind of a dismal

1031
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:16,199
winter but for people that like the

1032
00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:21,318
warmth it was nice um we can break it

1033
00:45:16,199 --> 00:45:25,879
out lost by different soil structure so

1034
00:45:21,318 --> 00:45:28,400
sand leeching so this this field the two

1035
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:30,920
red spots in the field sand so we are

1036
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:32,599
losing a lot of nitrogen on that sand so

1037
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:34,680
what do we do we talk to this girl the

1038
00:45:32,599 --> 00:45:36,680
next year and say maybe we pull the

1039
00:45:34,679 --> 00:45:39,399
anhydrous bar up as we go across those

1040
00:45:36,679 --> 00:45:41,919
spots maybe it's not worth it to put

1041
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:44,119
that nitrogen down in those areas and we

1042
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:47,240
we treat it differently or we go to a

1043
00:45:44,119 --> 00:45:49,160
all spring Ura application variable rate

1044
00:45:47,239 --> 00:45:51,799
and and just start with a lower rate at

1045
00:45:49,159 --> 00:45:53,799
that point so those are all the metrics

1046
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:56,480
that that we look at when we're we're

1047
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:57,599
trying to Define what what the wreck

1048
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:59,719
will look like

1049
00:45:57,599 --> 00:46:03,480
so now that other wreck is

1050
00:45:59,719 --> 00:46:07,279
back so I can look to see now

1051
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:10,400
how the wreck is adjusted by changing

1052
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:12,599
that nitrogen um that yield that yield

1053
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:16,280
goal so we were we're going to go from a

1054
00:46:12,599 --> 00:46:17,920
95 pound rate to a 40 pound rate so now

1055
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:21,040
we're looking at a new

1056
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:24,039
recommendation based on

1057
00:46:21,039 --> 00:46:26,440
um this lower yield goal which is more

1058
00:46:24,039 --> 00:46:28,358
realistic to what the season is so this

1059
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:29,960
is where the user would go

1060
00:46:28,358 --> 00:46:32,838
out

1061
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:35,480
um and and take this to the field to

1062
00:46:32,838 --> 00:46:36,759
apply and you can see the how much time

1063
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:39,440
do I have left

1064
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:41,839
Harold uh we're just about out of time

1065
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:45,280
yes okay so I I I just want to do one

1066
00:46:41,838 --> 00:46:48,159
more thing here so the main thing about

1067
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:51,079
this is a tool that's in this tool set

1068
00:46:48,159 --> 00:46:53,118
that's really um powerful is I'm going

1069
00:46:51,079 --> 00:46:54,839
to pick this field so I'm I'm going to

1070
00:46:53,119 --> 00:46:58,680
get ready to take this to the to the

1071
00:46:54,838 --> 00:47:01,159
field to spread and what I can do is I

1072
00:46:58,679 --> 00:47:04,199
can come in here and and select this

1073
00:47:01,159 --> 00:47:07,558
adapt end only

1074
00:47:04,199 --> 00:47:09,639
wreck and I have a product built in here

1075
00:47:07,559 --> 00:47:12,400
um called just straight nitrogen so I

1076
00:47:09,639 --> 00:47:14,679
just call it adapted nitrogen need and

1077
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:18,200
what I do is I run

1078
00:47:14,679 --> 00:47:19,919
this and I do a flat rate comparison so

1079
00:47:18,199 --> 00:47:22,118
if you remember this field was calling

1080
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:23,680
for 40 pounds of n so I'm going to

1081
00:47:22,119 --> 00:47:25,960
submit

1082
00:47:23,679 --> 00:47:28,919
this and this is where you would send

1083
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:30,838
the the prodct to the machine it sends

1084
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:32,358
direct if your machine or asset is

1085
00:47:30,838 --> 00:47:33,639
connected we can send it right to the

1086
00:47:32,358 --> 00:47:36,039
machine out in the field we don't have

1087
00:47:33,639 --> 00:47:37,960
to do jump drives and stuff like that

1088
00:47:36,039 --> 00:47:40,880
that we had to do in the old user

1089
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:44,679
interface but what this is showing

1090
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:46,358
is the red areas are being underapplied

1091
00:47:44,679 --> 00:47:48,558
and the green areas are being over

1092
00:47:46,358 --> 00:47:53,519
applied or vice

1093
00:47:48,559 --> 00:47:55,920
versa so in this 50 pound application

1094
00:47:53,519 --> 00:47:57,440
rate that we're going to put on this

1095
00:47:55,920 --> 00:48:00,480
field

1096
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:03,480
some areas are getting 135 pounds and

1097
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:06,318
some areas should get a lot less than

1098
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:09,000
that and so what it does is it shows the

1099
00:48:06,318 --> 00:48:12,279
farmer that if I went out with that 50

1100
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:15,159
pound rate or the yeah if I went out

1101
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:17,480
with that 50 pound

1102
00:48:15,159 --> 00:48:21,118
rate some areas I would be under

1103
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:23,280
applying by 110 PBS and other areas I

1104
00:48:21,119 --> 00:48:25,480
would over apply by 40

1105
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:28,839
PBS

1106
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:30,599
so by by doing a flat rate application

1107
00:48:28,838 --> 00:48:32,719
you're not putting the right product in

1108
00:48:30,599 --> 00:48:34,359
the right place and that's the main

1109
00:48:32,719 --> 00:48:37,279
point of the 4 hours

1110
00:48:34,358 --> 00:48:39,679
is if if I were to recommend if this

1111
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:44,720
person absolutely did not want to do

1112
00:48:39,679 --> 00:48:48,919
varable rate and they wanted to um

1113
00:48:44,719 --> 00:48:51,838
maximize yield on this

1114
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:53,480
field the recommendation to that grower

1115
00:48:51,838 --> 00:48:56,119
would be you need to be somewhere in

1116
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:59,639
that 120 to 150 pound range across the

1117
00:48:56,119 --> 00:49:01,760
field because you want to maximize y the

1118
00:48:59,639 --> 00:49:04,440
yield at the highest

1119
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:06,960
level so it's it's really unfortunate

1120
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:09,039
that people are looking at what they can

1121
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:11,599
do and not utilizing the tools that are

1122
00:49:09,039 --> 00:49:13,798
out there with the GPS and the variable

1123
00:49:11,599 --> 00:49:15,960
rate application and and and and it's

1124
00:49:13,798 --> 00:49:18,440
getting more and more I mean things are

1125
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:20,280
coming online faster than ever and and

1126
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:22,440
looking forward to where you know the

1127
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:24,599
next 10 years are going to go with with

1128
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:28,200
all this technology and Automation and

1129
00:49:24,599 --> 00:49:30,200
and AI um EV valuations of fields and

1130
00:49:28,199 --> 00:49:33,039
and data so maybe you don't have to go

1131
00:49:30,199 --> 00:49:36,000
out and boot check it or you can use

1132
00:49:33,039 --> 00:49:40,519
data imagery more quickly and have more

1133
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:42,960
more images available so um again yeah

1134
00:49:40,519 --> 00:49:45,039
appreciate the time I I get excited when

1135
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:47,240
I when I think about all the

1136
00:49:45,039 --> 00:49:49,838
opportunities that users have now today

1137
00:49:47,239 --> 00:49:52,679
with the DAP in and and just appreciate

1138
00:49:49,838 --> 00:49:55,279
Cornell and Harold you know coming up

1139
00:49:52,679 --> 00:49:58,078
with the tool and and hopefully we can

1140
00:49:55,280 --> 00:50:00,720
continue the relationship to to to

1141
00:49:58,079 --> 00:50:03,440
continue to make it better and one other

1142
00:50:00,719 --> 00:50:07,159
thing the the university validity is is

1143
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:09,960
a big deal Farmers want that that check

1144
00:50:07,159 --> 00:50:12,480
they want that that um I know what I'm

1145
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:14,838
doing is right um and I'm not going to

1146
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:14,838
lose

1147
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:20,239
you great thank you very much

1148
00:50:22,639 --> 00:50:27,759
Kevin I hope that gave you a little bit

1149
00:50:24,798 --> 00:50:29,358
of a taste of um the benefits that we

1150
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:31,440
have from integration with other

1151
00:50:29,358 --> 00:50:34,239
software and the innovations that are

1152
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:35,798
happening on that end and and how we

1153
00:50:34,239 --> 00:50:38,838
basically can partner with him Janice

1154
00:50:35,798 --> 00:50:40,280
you have a question uh at the 10th

1155
00:50:38,838 --> 00:50:44,159
celebration

1156
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:47,160
of school I hope you were there's

1157
00:50:44,159 --> 00:50:49,039
presentation I wasn't no okay where he

1158
00:50:47,159 --> 00:50:52,440
heralded un

1159
00:50:49,039 --> 00:50:57,159
intended in on one of the slides as a

1160
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:58,519
pleasant outcome of the school but

1161
00:50:57,159 --> 00:51:01,759
yeah so

1162
00:50:58,519 --> 00:51:05,559
congratul Wasing his

1163
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:07,280
presentation really delighted to see so

1164
00:51:05,559 --> 00:51:10,839
there was a little bit of her Buckle in

1165
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:12,960
the back when um uh end supplying

1166
00:51:10,838 --> 00:51:15,279
capacity of the soil was discussed and I

1167
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:19,838
just want to understand this aspect of

1168
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:19,839
it a little bit better I mean um

1169
00:51:20,199 --> 00:51:27,078
andiz your your climate and all the rest

1170
00:51:23,838 --> 00:51:30,159
so are you starting from um

1171
00:51:27,079 --> 00:51:32,680
a position of having a soil Heth measur

1172
00:51:30,159 --> 00:51:36,159
on soil protein for example and then

1173
00:51:32,679 --> 00:51:39,239
work that into the bottle how is the end

1174
00:51:36,159 --> 00:51:42,480
the capacity of the soil itself being

1175
00:51:39,239 --> 00:51:45,000
put into these calculations in account

1176
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:49,079
yeah no that's that's a good question um

1177
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:50,920
so we we we we basically have um kind of

1178
00:51:49,079 --> 00:51:53,318
two pools that we're working with so one

1179
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:55,880
is the is the soil organic matter pool

1180
00:51:53,318 --> 00:51:58,400
and the mineralization of soil organic

1181
00:51:55,880 --> 00:52:03,079
matter and we're basing that currently

1182
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:07,880
on uh basically on uh organic matter and

1183
00:52:03,079 --> 00:52:10,318
texture so um uh we're not using any of

1184
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:12,200
the soil health indicators uh that's

1185
00:52:10,318 --> 00:52:14,039
something that I'd like to do um but

1186
00:52:12,199 --> 00:52:15,879
it's not that widely measured you know

1187
00:52:14,039 --> 00:52:19,039
so so organic matter is you know

1188
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:21,200
standard soil testing the other pool uh

1189
00:52:19,039 --> 00:52:23,920
is the more layby pool that is

1190
00:52:21,199 --> 00:52:26,679
associated with uh sort of these more

1191
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:28,480
recent additions so like a cover crop uh

1192
00:52:26,679 --> 00:52:30,759
Kevin didn't have time to really talk

1193
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:32,920
about that but we we you know worked and

1194
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:38,839
Matt Ryan actually contribute Matt was

1195
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:41,920
here right yeah um uh helped uh and um

1196
00:52:38,838 --> 00:52:44,000
Steve mky as well had some good data on

1197
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:47,000
You Know cover crop nitrogen uh

1198
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:48,920
contributions or uh previous some of my

1199
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:51,199
earlier work at the willsboro farm on

1200
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:54,480
you know Alfalfa contribution so those

1201
00:52:51,199 --> 00:52:56,919
are kind of seen as more L B Pools and

1202
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:59,318
then we had s organic matter pool so

1203
00:52:56,920 --> 00:53:01,480
it's uh you know you have to you have to

1204
00:52:59,318 --> 00:53:03,000
make shortcuts right you have to so you

1205
00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:06,719
have to focus on you know what what

1206
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:08,838
really matters and uh so yeah so that's

1207
00:53:06,719 --> 00:53:10,719
basically manure of course is a big

1208
00:53:08,838 --> 00:53:12,719
issue and you know being here in New

1209
00:53:10,719 --> 00:53:15,439
York we put a lot of effort into the

1210
00:53:12,719 --> 00:53:18,318
manure component and U and it's

1211
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:21,519
interesting because the here in New York

1212
00:53:18,318 --> 00:53:23,199
especially uh the Consultants so ACS

1213
00:53:21,519 --> 00:53:25,358
which is the big uh crop consulting

1214
00:53:23,199 --> 00:53:27,598
company their headquarters right here by

1215
00:53:25,358 --> 00:53:31,239
the airport on for Road they're

1216
00:53:27,599 --> 00:53:33,280
developing new software uh that uh

1217
00:53:31,239 --> 00:53:36,078
focuses a little bit more on the dairy

1218
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:38,240
industry and uh so they're going to be

1219
00:53:36,079 --> 00:53:40,839
one of the users of adap and through

1220
00:53:38,239 --> 00:53:43,519
their own ecosystem through their own

1221
00:53:40,838 --> 00:53:46,759
platform basically so but the but the

1222
00:53:43,519 --> 00:53:49,639
yeah the the manure manure issue is any

1223
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:51,440
of these organic inputs as you know are

1224
00:53:49,639 --> 00:53:55,440
much tougher to deal with then sort of

1225
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:57,838
like a straight you know Ura or you know

1226
00:53:55,440 --> 00:54:00,440
uh uh

1227
00:53:57,838 --> 00:54:02,400
uh liquid solution or anything like that

1228
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:04,318
so I think we can take a little bit of

1229
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:06,720
Pride on on that component at least that

1230
00:54:04,318 --> 00:54:10,960
I think we've done a fairly good job

1231
00:54:06,719 --> 00:54:10,959
yeah any other questions

1232
00:54:20,159 --> 00:54:25,920
yeah no not that I'm aware of we we did

1233
00:54:23,119 --> 00:54:29,358
work with um environmental defense fund

1234
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:32,440
a few years years ago on uh the issue of

1235
00:54:29,358 --> 00:54:34,880
a benchmark the end balance uh uh

1236
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:37,400
Benchmark uh and to see how that sort of

1237
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:39,920
related to actual recommendations and

1238
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:43,160
whe you know you'd be able to meet a

1239
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:46,159
certain criteria certain uh inbalance

1240
00:54:43,159 --> 00:54:48,558
benchmarks that's about about the extent

1241
00:54:46,159 --> 00:54:51,719
of it you know it's been you know one of

1242
00:54:48,559 --> 00:54:54,640
the reasons why we uh decided to go and

1243
00:54:51,719 --> 00:54:55,519
license it is uh is because it was very

1244
00:54:54,639 --> 00:55:01,159
difficult to work with other

1245
00:54:55,519 --> 00:55:04,000
universities uh they they um so when you

1246
00:55:01,159 --> 00:55:05,519
do an innovation you're uh to some

1247
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:07,838
extent disrupting I mean I don't like

1248
00:55:05,519 --> 00:55:09,440
the term disrupting because it's kind of

1249
00:55:07,838 --> 00:55:11,960
overused

1250
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:14,280
but within the us we have a land gr

1251
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:16,039
University system and every state has

1252
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:19,040
their own langr University and has their

1253
00:55:16,039 --> 00:55:20,358
own nutrient recommendations and we only

1254
00:55:19,039 --> 00:55:22,358
have that with nutrient recommendations

1255
00:55:20,358 --> 00:55:24,558
we don't have it with tillet or cover

1256
00:55:22,358 --> 00:55:25,639
crop recommendations or but nutrients

1257
00:55:24,559 --> 00:55:28,240
every state has their own

1258
00:55:25,639 --> 00:55:32,038
recommendations system and so our system

1259
00:55:28,239 --> 00:55:34,038
was much more Universal and um and so it

1260
00:55:32,039 --> 00:55:36,079
was difficult working with the

1261
00:55:34,039 --> 00:55:38,680
specialist in each of the land grant

1262
00:55:36,079 --> 00:55:41,640
University uh and so we said okay let's

1263
00:55:38,679 --> 00:55:43,719
in let's in Just Go the commercial route

1264
00:55:41,639 --> 00:55:46,400
and I'm really really glad we did

1265
00:55:43,719 --> 00:55:48,959
because you can see the the the result

1266
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:50,680
that if you work with the commercial SE

1267
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:52,639
sector you can really innovate and keep

1268
00:55:50,679 --> 00:55:57,960
innovating you

1269
00:55:52,639 --> 00:55:57,960
know I the

1270
00:55:58,119 --> 00:56:02,519
I we need to talk to the company you

1271
00:56:00,679 --> 00:56:05,598
know the the uh the company has an

1272
00:56:02,519 --> 00:56:08,639
exclusive license so so they can sub

1273
00:56:05,599 --> 00:56:10,760
license uh but Cornell cannot sub

1274
00:56:08,639 --> 00:56:12,759
license to someone else but yeah we've

1275
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:15,000
always worked with with other uh

1276
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:18,839
organizations like the University of

1277
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:22,000
Nebraska um Auburn University NC State

1278
00:56:18,838 --> 00:56:25,119
University so uh they're uh the company

1279
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:28,039
is very open to you know collaborations

1280
00:56:25,119 --> 00:56:29,280
we always are careful that uh because

1281
00:56:28,039 --> 00:56:31,240
sometimes you have collaborators who

1282
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:33,359
don't use the the tool properly and then

1283
00:56:31,239 --> 00:56:36,118
they say oh it doesn't work it's say no

1284
00:56:33,358 --> 00:56:37,920
you didn't use it properly uh so uh

1285
00:56:36,119 --> 00:56:42,559
there's but yeah in general they're very

1286
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:42,559
open to that yeah yeah

1287
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:56,639
baru

1288
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:59,639
thisat kinon something I was watching so

1289
00:56:56,639 --> 00:56:59,639
complex or

1290
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:05,920
compated very

1291
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:05,920
busy of

1292
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:25,838
things I would say that the that the

1293
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:28,679
vast majority uh of the users are these

1294
00:57:25,838 --> 00:57:31,838
consult these people these agronomists

1295
00:57:28,679 --> 00:57:35,679
and they could work either with um you

1296
00:57:31,838 --> 00:57:37,759
say a co-op uh they could be a private

1297
00:57:35,679 --> 00:57:40,159
consultant uh sometimes they work with a

1298
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:42,480
larger company maybe Kevin you can chime

1299
00:57:40,159 --> 00:57:45,078
in a little bit on that but I would say

1300
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:48,039
it's now fairly rare that it's an

1301
00:57:45,079 --> 00:57:50,039
individual farmer although it may be a

1302
00:57:48,039 --> 00:57:52,920
larger farm that employs their own

1303
00:57:50,039 --> 00:57:54,640
agronomist you know it's basically you

1304
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:57,000
know it it it probably looked a lot more

1305
00:57:54,639 --> 00:57:58,440
complicated than than is you know there

1306
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:00,440
there's not that steep of a learning

1307
00:57:58,440 --> 00:58:03,440
curve but you know you always have to

1308
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:04,880
strike a balance between uh you know

1309
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:06,599
people want certain level of

1310
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:08,519
sophistication because they want good

1311
00:58:06,599 --> 00:58:11,519
recommendations but if you have a data

1312
00:58:08,519 --> 00:58:14,639
driven tool it does require you know

1313
00:58:11,519 --> 00:58:17,199
some skills to be able to uh you know to

1314
00:58:14,639 --> 00:58:19,759
use it effectively so Kevin do you have

1315
00:58:17,199 --> 00:58:21,199
any did you hear that question yeah I I

1316
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:23,559
heard a little bit of it it was breaking

1317
00:58:21,199 --> 00:58:26,480
up but I think the the the the gist of

1318
00:58:23,559 --> 00:58:28,640
it was I would say 98% of the Acres that

1319
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:31,079
are run through adapt and today are done

1320
00:58:28,639 --> 00:58:33,598
through a retail agronomist or a crop

1321
00:58:31,079 --> 00:58:37,160
consultant type of business and the

1322
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:42,200
reason is is that farmers want that they

1323
00:58:37,159 --> 00:58:44,279
want they request that second opinion um

1324
00:58:42,199 --> 00:58:45,960
just like doing their taxes a lot of a

1325
00:58:44,280 --> 00:58:49,079
lot of farmers aren't going to prepare

1326
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:50,559
their own their own tax returns um just

1327
00:58:49,079 --> 00:58:52,920
because there's so much detail and

1328
00:58:50,559 --> 00:58:55,240
nitrogen is the same way a farmer wants

1329
00:58:52,920 --> 00:58:57,599
another set of eyes and they want proof

1330
00:58:55,239 --> 00:58:59,318
and data to know that they're doing the

1331
00:58:57,599 --> 00:59:01,240
right thing Farmers want to be

1332
00:58:59,318 --> 00:59:03,239
environmentally sensitive they they

1333
00:59:01,239 --> 00:59:06,159
really do but they also have to do it at

1334
00:59:03,239 --> 00:59:08,038
a cost and so how do how do we marry

1335
00:59:06,159 --> 00:59:10,920
both of those together but I would say

1336
00:59:08,039 --> 00:59:14,599
the majority of our users are crop

1337
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:14,599
consultant or retail

1338
00:59:16,639 --> 00:59:22,159
anonomous this has been a production of

1339
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:25,160
Cornell University on the web at

1340
