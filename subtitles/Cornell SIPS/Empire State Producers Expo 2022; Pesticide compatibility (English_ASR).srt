00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:05,839
this is a production of cornell

2
00:00:03,198 --> 00:00:05,839
university

3
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:11,920
all right well thank you everyone for

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:14,000
coming today um and thanks so much for

5
00:00:11,919 --> 00:00:15,439
your introduction steve

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,359
i'm going to first introduce my program

7
00:00:15,439 --> 00:00:19,839
a little bit i know that steve did as

8
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:21,199
well um so we'll do a little bit of an

9
00:00:19,839 --> 00:00:22,000
introduction of the resources we have

10
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:23,279
for you

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,359
and then i'm going to define

12
00:00:23,278 --> 00:00:26,960
incompatibility and then we'll kind of

13
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:28,480
get into the meat of the talk and that's

14
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:32,320
where we'll be talking about how to

15
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:32,320
avoid incompatibility issues

16
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:36,160
so as steve said i'm the director and

17
00:00:34,558 --> 00:00:37,839
educator with our program cornell

18
00:00:36,159 --> 00:00:40,238
cooperative extension pesticide safety

19
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:42,640
education program we go by cce psep and

20
00:00:40,238 --> 00:00:44,159
we were formerly pmep

21
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,878
and we've been a leader in pesticide

22
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:48,238
safety education for over 40 years

23
00:00:46,878 --> 00:00:50,320
and you know steve mentioned that we

24
00:00:48,238 --> 00:00:51,839
provide training we answer questions and

25
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,759
we serve as an objective source of

26
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,480
information about pesticides for both

27
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:57,759
applicators and consumers

28
00:00:56,479 --> 00:01:01,038
and what might be of interest to you is

29
00:00:57,759 --> 00:01:02,718
we have applicator certification manuals

30
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:03,920
and so we write and publish those

31
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:05,198
manuals

32
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,799
which you can use to study for your

33
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:08,158
certification exam

34
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:09,760
and you can purchase those online

35
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:11,118
through the cornell store at the link

36
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:13,439
here

37
00:01:11,118 --> 00:01:15,759
and the manuals of interest to you would

38
00:01:13,438 --> 00:01:18,000
include probably fruit and vegetables so

39
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:20,879
we have category 22 and 23 we also have

40
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,879
the core manual

41
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:24,798
we also have uh in addition to the live

42
00:01:23,438 --> 00:01:26,798
talks that i'm giving today we give

43
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:28,720
talks like this but we also give

44
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:30,880
on-demand recertification courses that

45
00:01:28,719 --> 00:01:33,118
are online so you can just go to our

46
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:34,078
distance learning center uh

47
00:01:33,118 --> 00:01:35,519
you know this might be a little bit

48
00:01:34,078 --> 00:01:37,359
harder to read but you can see there's a

49
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:39,039
wide variety of talks from

50
00:01:37,359 --> 00:01:41,280
recertification credits in new york

51
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:43,439
state and also nine other northeast

52
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,280
states um and they cover core and

53
00:01:43,438 --> 00:01:46,398
category topics so this might be of

54
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49,118
interest to you if you're looking to get

55
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:50,719
some more credits

56
00:01:49,118 --> 00:01:52,959
and then we also publish the cornell

57
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:55,118
crop and pest management guidelines

58
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:57,199
and we're currently selling the 2022

59
00:01:55,118 --> 00:01:58,399
guidelines uh

60
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,320
the guidelines that might be of interest

61
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:02,320
to you are probably you know vegetable

62
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:03,438
tree fruit and barrier out also field

63
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:04,639
crops

64
00:02:03,438 --> 00:02:06,718
and you can purchase those online as

65
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,479
well

66
00:02:06,718 --> 00:02:10,399
okay so now that i've kind of shown off

67
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:11,360
our program resources a little bit here

68
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:14,318
um

69
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:16,480
i do a little bit of housekeeping so

70
00:02:14,318 --> 00:02:18,399
uh in this talk there's some pesticide

71
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:20,000
trade names that are included

72
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,599
and the sole purpose of having those

73
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,560
trade names in there is to explain

74
00:02:21,598 --> 00:02:24,560
common

75
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,239
compatibility issues they're just

76
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,920
examples i'm not endorsing the products

77
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:28,878
mentioned here and if i don't mention

78
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:30,399
something it's not because i'm

79
00:02:28,878 --> 00:02:31,679
criticizing it

80
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,959
and please know that you know i'm only

81
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,360
sharing sections of the label you have

82
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:37,199
to read the entire label

83
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:40,560
specific to your product before you go

84
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:41,598
to purchase mix load store or apply it

85
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,199
to make sure you're using that product

86
00:02:41,598 --> 00:02:44,479
correctly

87
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:46,399
okay now that we've gotten through all

88
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:47,759
that housekeeping um let's get into

89
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,760
things so when we think about

90
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:51,359
incompatibility you know the first thing

91
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:52,878
i kind of want to zoom out first and

92
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:56,319
really talk about

93
00:02:52,878 --> 00:02:58,560
why uh do we run into this problem and

94
00:02:56,318 --> 00:03:00,318
mainly it's tank mixing right so

95
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,560
let's talk about the benefits of tank

96
00:03:00,318 --> 00:03:04,560
mixing first uh before we get into

97
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,360
incompatibility issues

98
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,920
so

99
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:10,560
you know there are many upsides to tank

100
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:10,559
mixing

101
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:13,680
it can help you make more timely

102
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:16,080
applications you often have a very

103
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,840
narrow window of time where your pest is

104
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,519
in the correct life stage and weather

105
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:22,158
conditions to allow for you to

106
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:24,158
effectively use chemical controls right

107
00:03:22,158 --> 00:03:25,759
and mixing multiple products in one

108
00:03:24,158 --> 00:03:27,759
application

109
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:29,120
can reduce expenses associated with

110
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:32,878
labor

111
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:33,759
time wear and equipment

112
00:03:32,878 --> 00:03:36,479
and

113
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:38,639
you can also reduce soil compaction um

114
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:41,759
or crop damage just by not going out as

115
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:44,238
often right and you can improve control

116
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:47,359
with tanks mixing by hitting a pest with

117
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:48,799
multiple different products

118
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,879
and then you can also manage multiple

119
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:52,159
pests in one application by for instance

120
00:03:50,878 --> 00:03:53,598
you know mixing an herbicide and an

121
00:03:52,158 --> 00:03:55,519
insecticide together

122
00:03:53,598 --> 00:03:57,039
or combining pre and post-emergent

123
00:03:55,519 --> 00:04:00,719
herbicides to manage multiple different

124
00:03:57,039 --> 00:04:02,000
species of wheat at the same time

125
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:04,000
so there's a lot of benefits to tank

126
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,039
mixing and you know before you take mix

127
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,719
you have to make sure the following

128
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:08,000
things are true you want to make sure

129
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:10,400
that none of the pesticide labels

130
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,639
prohibit that mix the timing is right

131
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,400
for efficacy of each pesticide against

132
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:16,639
the target pests

133
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,160
that the application method is used

134
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:19,680
that you're using is appropriate for all

135
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,439
pesticides that mix

136
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,040
and you want to make sure that mixing

137
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:24,959
those pesticides won't lead to

138
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,160
incompatibility

139
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:28,159
and so that's what we're going to focus

140
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:31,520
on today is the incompatibility piece of

141
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:33,439
it so first let's define incompatibility

142
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:35,439
so incompatibility occurs when you're

143
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:38,000
mixing two or more pesticide products

144
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:39,918
together and that negatively influences

145
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,639
how the other pesticide products in the

146
00:04:39,918 --> 00:04:44,879
tank disperse mix and deliver

147
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:46,879
so basically incompatibility is where

148
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:49,918
one or more of your pesticide products

149
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:51,040
are no longer effective for pest control

150
00:04:49,918 --> 00:04:52,159
because you mix them with another

151
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,000
product

152
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,759
and there's two types of incompatibility

153
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,839
that we're going to talk about so you've

154
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:59,360
got physical incompatibility this is

155
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:00,799
kind of the more obvious one right it's

156
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:03,038
the failure of pesticide products to

157
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,960
stay uniformly mixed in the spray tank

158
00:05:03,038 --> 00:05:06,240
and you're going to see all sorts of

159
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:08,000
horrible stuff

160
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,160
you've seen some of these pictures here

161
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,439
the products fail to stay uh uniformly

162
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,520
mixed that you're seeing separation into

163
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:16,079
layers of putties and pastes

164
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:18,478
clogging of screens and nozzles uh this

165
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:20,399
is difficult to clean and it can render

166
00:05:18,478 --> 00:05:22,478
the products ineffective or impossible

167
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:23,918
to spray and then if you have you know

168
00:05:22,478 --> 00:05:25,839
some of that left in your tank you can

169
00:05:23,918 --> 00:05:28,079
actually those residues can cause injury

170
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:29,679
to your crops later on if it's not

171
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:31,439
cleaned properly

172
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,759
and the other type of incompatibility is

173
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:35,199
chemical incompatibility

174
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:37,280
and so this occurs when you're mixing

175
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:39,280
two pesticides together

176
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:42,159
are two or more and the activity of one

177
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:44,239
of those pesticides is reduced

178
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:47,120
um so you're going to see reduced

179
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:48,240
efficacy or even undesirable crop damage

180
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,160
um

181
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,160
and the only indication often of

182
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,759
chemical incompatibility is the lack of

183
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:56,160
results

184
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:58,080
or efficacy okay so if you've ever mixed

185
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,080
a tank application in the field

186
00:05:58,079 --> 00:06:01,680
that was mysteriously ineffective that's

187
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:06,318
probably due to a chemical

188
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:07,519
incompatibility it's very rarely visible

189
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:09,520
so regardless of which type of

190
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:11,599
incompatibility you have uh there's

191
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:13,120
really negative consequences right you

192
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,800
might have to repeat the applications to

193
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,759
control your pests or even switch

194
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,919
products

195
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:19,600
if repeat application violates the label

196
00:06:17,918 --> 00:06:21,359
direction on that product

197
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:23,199
if you applied spilled or have to

198
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,879
dispose of the mixture then the

199
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:26,639
resultant mixture that could be

200
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:28,319
considered an environmental contaminant

201
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:30,478
right because it didn't provide any

202
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:31,919
benefit for pest control and now it's in

203
00:06:30,478 --> 00:06:34,800
the environment

204
00:06:31,918 --> 00:06:37,038
incompatibility waste time money

205
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,720
and product and as we talked about a

206
00:06:37,038 --> 00:06:41,199
little bit it can damage your equipment

207
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:43,440
and it can also injure your crop for

208
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:45,280
example with phytotoxicity there's a lot

209
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:47,120
of obvious incentives to avoiding

210
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:48,159
incompatibility

211
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,759
and so that's what we're going to talk

212
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:52,000
about now and this is just kind of an

213
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:53,520
overview of what we'll talk about today

214
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,279
uh mostly focusing on avoiding

215
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:56,639
incompatibility so we'll talk about only

216
00:06:55,279 --> 00:06:59,679
mixing a few

217
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:01,840
things reading the label mixing in order

218
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:04,000
mixing correctly knowing your carrier

219
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:06,079
properties conducting jar tests

220
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,439
accounting for multiple factors and then

221
00:07:06,079 --> 00:07:09,439
finally we'll talk about resolving

222
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:11,038
incompatibility if it should happen to

223
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:14,000
you but most of what we'll talk about

224
00:07:11,038 --> 00:07:17,120
today is avoiding it

225
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,720
so the first way to avoid compatibility

226
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,680
issues

227
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,360
uh

228
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:24,319
is to only mix a few products mixing

229
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:25,919
fewer products reduces your chance of

230
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:28,319
incompatibility

231
00:07:25,918 --> 00:07:30,000
so to get into why this is

232
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:31,039
let's talk about what goes into your

233
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,399
tank

234
00:07:31,038 --> 00:07:33,439
we've already discussed you're putting

235
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:34,879
pesticides in your tank and we're

236
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:37,360
talking about things like herbicides

237
00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:39,279
fungicides and sex science depending on

238
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,800
pesticides formulation

239
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:42,959
they might respond differently to things

240
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,560
like temperature water ph storage

241
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:46,399
conditions

242
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:48,399
mixing in the carrier and mixing with

243
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:49,198
other pesticide products

244
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:50,638
so

245
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:51,840
let's talk about what makes up a

246
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:53,199
pesticide

247
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:57,198
if you remember back to your core

248
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:59,598
training a pesticide formulation

249
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:01,680
is the active ingredient plus the inert

250
00:07:59,598 --> 00:08:03,680
ingredients right together that makes up

251
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,280
the formulation so for example we have

252
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,199
roundup pro it's a broad spectrum

253
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:09,119
post-emergency herbicide

254
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:10,960
and the pesticide

255
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,879
product name is roundup pro the active

256
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:15,120
ingredient is glyphosate and you can see

257
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:16,240
highlighted here it's a specific salt

258
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,918
form

259
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:21,598
and then 50

260
00:08:17,918 --> 00:08:23,439
uh 8 or 59 of this product

261
00:08:21,598 --> 00:08:26,478
is listed as other ingredients and those

262
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:27,598
are the inert ingredients

263
00:08:26,478 --> 00:08:30,240
you're probably familiar with a lot of

264
00:08:27,598 --> 00:08:31,038
these inert ingredients um

265
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,639
but

266
00:08:31,038 --> 00:08:34,559
you know what they do is they improve

267
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:35,679
efficacy so the active ingredient is the

268
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:37,119
thing that's actually preventing

269
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:38,079
destroying repelling and mitigating the

270
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,360
pests

271
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,599
and the inert ingredients actually

272
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:45,120
improving efficacy uh shelf life

273
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:46,480
application ease and applicator safety

274
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:49,039
and it can do things like reduce

275
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:51,278
segregation from sunlight for example or

276
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:54,679
help penetrate the active ingredient

277
00:08:51,278 --> 00:08:54,679
into a weed

278
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:58,719
and so inner ingredients include things

279
00:08:56,559 --> 00:08:59,838
like solvents and anti-drift and wetting

280
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:03,120
agents

281
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:05,600
antifreeze and ph buffers

282
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:07,440
d foamers

283
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,440
so when you're taking mixing two or more

284
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,800
pesticides together

285
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:13,040
you know when you think about how

286
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:15,278
complicated the formulation can be it

287
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:17,360
makes sense that simply because of those

288
00:09:15,278 --> 00:09:19,439
complex formulations you might see

289
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:21,200
incompatibility because it's often the

290
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,200
inert ingredient that composes

291
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,959
incompatibility issues

292
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,640
now think about everything else that

293
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:28,239
goes into your tank okay you've got

294
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:30,639
fertilizers macronutrients

295
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:32,799
micronutrients plant

296
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:35,278
growth regulators spray dyes

297
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:36,879
biostimulants okay and all of these

298
00:09:35,278 --> 00:09:37,919
substances can interact with one another

299
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:40,320
and with the water and with your

300
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:41,278
pesticides and the carrier's ph

301
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,480
um

302
00:09:41,278 --> 00:09:44,639
and the temperature and the mineral

303
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,560
content resulting in compatibility okay

304
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:48,958
so this is really why

305
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:50,319
if you can reduce the number of products

306
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:53,679
that you're mixing you're going to have

307
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,680
less chance of thinking ability

308
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:58,080
now i'd be remiss as a pesticide safety

309
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:00,320
educator if i didn't talk about

310
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,839
this so when you're mixing pesticides

311
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:04,480
together you have to follow the

312
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:06,800
strictest label okay and i'm sure you've

313
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:09,519
heard of this um but let's just take an

314
00:10:06,799 --> 00:10:13,278
example here so you've got product a and

315
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:15,360
product a requires a rei of eight hours

316
00:10:13,278 --> 00:10:17,600
and product b is four hours okay so

317
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,120
product a is a little more strict here

318
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:21,839
and then product a requires chemical

319
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:23,919
resistant gloves and product b requires

320
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:26,320
us gloves but also protective eyewear

321
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:28,399
and a respirator

322
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,839
so we're mixing these two together you

323
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:33,360
know what rei are we going to be

324
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:35,120
expecting and what level of ppe

325
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,959
well it's going to be the strictest from

326
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,839
each thing

327
00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:38,958
so

328
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:40,640
you know

329
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:43,359
when you mix things together basically

330
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:45,519
the hazards posed by each pesticide are

331
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:47,360
still present okay so whatever houses

332
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:49,440
there were that that required product a

333
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:50,879
to have that eight hour rei that's still

334
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:53,440
there right

335
00:10:50,879 --> 00:10:54,639
and um the same thing for product b you

336
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,720
know maybe there was a respiratory

337
00:10:54,639 --> 00:10:58,559
concern maybe like an inhalation hazard

338
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,839
of some sort that's still gonna be true

339
00:10:58,559 --> 00:11:03,119
when you mix things together so that's

340
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:05,839
why you follow the strictest label

341
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:09,919
so the next way to avoid incompatibility

342
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:09,920
um is to read the label

343
00:11:10,159 --> 00:11:14,480
now product labels can tell you a lot of

344
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,440
different things regarding compatibility

345
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,120
okay

346
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,240
so they have statements about other

347
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,480
products that are tested for

348
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:22,560
compatibility with your pesticide the

349
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:25,120
order in which to add products

350
00:11:22,559 --> 00:11:26,879
recommendations for tank mix agitation

351
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:29,039
products not to mix

352
00:11:26,879 --> 00:11:31,679
sensitivities to temperature

353
00:11:29,039 --> 00:11:33,679
warnings about ph of water hardness

354
00:11:31,679 --> 00:11:36,799
recommended carrier volume

355
00:11:33,679 --> 00:11:38,958
and whether you need to

356
00:11:36,799 --> 00:11:40,838
tank mix and adjuvant okay so all those

357
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:42,559
things can be on the

358
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:44,880
label

359
00:11:42,559 --> 00:11:47,679
but i do want you to keep in mind that

360
00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:50,320
compatibility issues are only sometimes

361
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:52,078
and not always mentioned on the label

362
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:53,839
so in red here i'm just going to give

363
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:55,679
you one example

364
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:57,360
uh and that's you know this example of

365
00:11:55,679 --> 00:11:58,559
other products so sometimes the label

366
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,320
will list other products tested for

367
00:11:58,559 --> 00:12:02,399
compatibility with your product right

368
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,839
but they don't always do it

369
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:06,240
um

370
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:07,680
so companies will test formulations with

371
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,680
other products that applicators might

372
00:12:07,679 --> 00:12:13,039
apply during the season but they do not

373
00:12:09,679 --> 00:12:14,958
account for every possible tank mix

374
00:12:13,039 --> 00:12:17,679
okay and so

375
00:12:14,958 --> 00:12:20,958
um you know this is just an example

376
00:12:17,679 --> 00:12:23,958
that you really gotta make sure to

377
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:23,958
um

378
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,278
you know keep in mind that that's not

379
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:28,159
always going to be on the label right so

380
00:12:27,278 --> 00:12:30,159
really

381
00:12:28,159 --> 00:12:31,519
when it comes down to it

382
00:12:30,159 --> 00:12:32,799
you're the one that's responsible for

383
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:35,360
knowing if the products in your tank are

384
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:35,359
compatible

385
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:40,399
and hopefully what we're talking about

386
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,919
today will help with that

387
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:44,159
so one of the major reasons that

388
00:12:41,919 --> 00:12:45,838
mixtures become incompatible are we

389
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:48,240
seeing compatibility issues is that

390
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:50,560
products were mixed in the incorrect

391
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:52,320
order

392
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:54,479
so mixing water is really important to

393
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:56,879
understand so let's start by talking

394
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:59,200
about mixing order with water as your

395
00:12:56,879 --> 00:13:01,600
carrier okay and we're going to touch on

396
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:03,759
fertilizer as your carrier next

397
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:06,240
we're going to start with water here um

398
00:13:03,759 --> 00:13:08,559
okay so the first thing to do like i

399
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:10,639
just stressed is to read and follow any

400
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:12,559
instructions on the label

401
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:14,399
and contact the manufacturer or you can

402
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:17,278
contact our program with any questions

403
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:18,559
okay so if the label touches on mixing

404
00:13:17,278 --> 00:13:21,278
at all you have to follow with the

405
00:13:18,559 --> 00:13:23,759
labels set if the label doesn't talk

406
00:13:21,278 --> 00:13:25,278
about you know the mixing order

407
00:13:23,759 --> 00:13:28,000
then there's kind of this generic order

408
00:13:25,278 --> 00:13:29,519
that i'm going to present to you okay

409
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,200
so this is the generic order if your

410
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:32,720
label doesn't say anything else okay

411
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,600
it's kind of a rule of thumb procedure

412
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,720
here

413
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,399
so what you're going to do is you're

414
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,759
going to agitate liquid products in

415
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:39,919
their containers

416
00:13:37,759 --> 00:13:41,278
as per the label instructions to ensure

417
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:42,958
that they're thoroughly mixed before you

418
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:45,039
add them to the tank then you're going

419
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:47,198
to add your water to the tank and

420
00:13:45,039 --> 00:13:48,799
usually recommend about 50 of the

421
00:13:47,198 --> 00:13:50,159
required volume

422
00:13:48,799 --> 00:13:52,000
and then you're going to start agitation

423
00:13:50,159 --> 00:13:53,439
of that tank before you even add the

424
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,919
first product you're going to continue

425
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:57,120
agitation throughout the mixing process

426
00:13:55,919 --> 00:14:00,799
and then you want to add products to

427
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:02,240
your tank in order based on formulation

428
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:05,599
so in blue here i'm going to give you

429
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:07,440
the order the formulation order okay

430
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,639
so this is not otherwise specifying the

431
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,320
label this is the order you're going to

432
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:12,560
follow

433
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,760
so first you want to add water soluble

434
00:14:12,559 --> 00:14:15,119
bags

435
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:17,198
okay then you want to add your dry

436
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:19,679
formulations including dry flowables and

437
00:14:17,198 --> 00:14:21,039
soluble rainbows and this is because

438
00:14:19,679 --> 00:14:22,879
these formulations must be mixed with

439
00:14:21,039 --> 00:14:25,278
water carrier with moderate agitation

440
00:14:22,879 --> 00:14:27,519
you want those particles to break apart

441
00:14:25,278 --> 00:14:28,720
and the surfactants to dissolve

442
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:30,000
and remember if you follow the mixing

443
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:32,240
order that we just talked about you

444
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,919
already have been agitating the water

445
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:37,278
okay so um that will already be starting

446
00:14:35,919 --> 00:14:39,039
now you want to make sure to give your

447
00:14:37,278 --> 00:14:40,958
dry formulations enough wait time to

448
00:14:39,039 --> 00:14:43,198
properly mix with water and part of this

449
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:45,198
is that you really should be only adding

450
00:14:43,198 --> 00:14:46,958
one of these at a time

451
00:14:45,198 --> 00:14:48,399
so you want to add the dry products one

452
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:50,638
at a time and then wait for each of them

453
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:52,879
to disperse before you add the next one

454
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:54,560
and this will give time for them to mix

455
00:14:52,879 --> 00:14:56,240
and also then if you encounter

456
00:14:54,559 --> 00:14:58,239
incompatibility you're going to lose

457
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,919
less product okay because you'll catch

458
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:02,000
it early you're not going to have to mix

459
00:14:59,919 --> 00:15:03,838
them all at once

460
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,440
with the water soluble packets you want

461
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:07,199
to visually ensure that those bags have

462
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:09,199
fully dissolved and the product has

463
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:11,759
dispersed okay and the kind of rule of

464
00:15:09,198 --> 00:15:13,519
thumb for each of these dry formulations

465
00:15:11,759 --> 00:15:14,720
is about three to five minutes but this

466
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:16,959
can really vary a lot and we're going to

467
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:18,480
touch on this later in the talk

468
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:20,159
but you know one of the factors that can

469
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:24,079
change that wait time

470
00:15:20,159 --> 00:15:24,078
is the temperature of the water

471
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:30,078
the next thing that can be added is the

472
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:32,159
dry or liquid ammonium sulfate after

473
00:15:30,078 --> 00:15:33,679
this step you could add the dry or solid

474
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:37,600
anti-drift agents and then the

475
00:15:33,679 --> 00:15:39,120
compatibility agents and anti-foamers

476
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,720
you're going to want to wait 2-3 minutes

477
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,159
after you add the compatibility agents

478
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,199
and anti-foamers before you go to the

479
00:15:42,159 --> 00:15:44,958
next step

480
00:15:43,198 --> 00:15:46,559
now while we have compatibility agents

481
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:49,439
anti-foamers of step five in this

482
00:15:46,559 --> 00:15:50,719
generic order you want to keep in mind

483
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,720
that um

484
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:54,320
they're not necessarily subject to a

485
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:56,480
typical mixing order protocol so you

486
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:57,920
really want to check for those uh

487
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:59,600
defomers

488
00:15:57,919 --> 00:16:01,360
and

489
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,959
the compatibility agents and see if the

490
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,399
label says anything about when to add

491
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:05,679
them and especially with the

492
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:07,360
anti-foamers you know you're kind of

493
00:16:05,679 --> 00:16:08,879
putting those in a lot of times you want

494
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:10,959
to put those in throughout the mixing

495
00:16:08,879 --> 00:16:12,399
process

496
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:14,958
so yeah just make sure to check the

497
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:14,958
labels there

498
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:19,600
next up you're going to add all liquid

499
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:20,959
formulations that have dispersed active

500
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,278
ingredients such as suspension

501
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:25,838
concentrates suspo emulsions emulsions

502
00:16:23,278 --> 00:16:28,000
in water micro capsules and flowables

503
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:31,120
and so this picture shows a suspension

504
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,120
in water on the left

505
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:36,000
the next thing you do is if you're

506
00:16:33,919 --> 00:16:39,120
planning to add emulsifiable

507
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:41,440
concentrates or ecs to your mixture

508
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:43,839
you'll want to add polymer-based drift

509
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:45,279
retardants first in step seven so you're

510
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:48,000
going to add those liquidus retardants

511
00:16:45,278 --> 00:16:50,559
and that allows the ec formulation to

512
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,240
absorb water and avoid clumping okay so

513
00:16:50,559 --> 00:16:54,239
then next you would add those remaining

514
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:56,480
liquid formulations which include the

515
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:58,240
emulsifiable concentrates and also oil

516
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:01,120
dispersions and salt solutions or

517
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:01,120
soluble liquids

518
00:17:01,679 --> 00:17:06,000
and because the ecs are oil or

519
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,679
solvent-based products they require more

520
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,919
time to disperse throughout the solution

521
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:12,480
the picture shown here shows an emulsion

522
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:15,199
in water on the right so often emulsions

523
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:16,558
appear milky

524
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:18,558
okay next you're going to add any

525
00:17:16,558 --> 00:17:20,160
remaining adjuvants such as crop oil

526
00:17:18,558 --> 00:17:22,240
concentrates high surfactant oil

527
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:25,199
concentrates methylated seed oils

528
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:28,400
non-ionic surfactants spreader stickers

529
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:29,360
and our conditioning agents

530
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:32,880
and then you're going to add

531
00:17:29,359 --> 00:17:35,119
micronutrients and liquid fertilizers

532
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:37,039
okay so now that you know the order to

533
00:17:35,119 --> 00:17:38,719
mix let's talk about why it's so

534
00:17:37,038 --> 00:17:40,319
important that things are mixed in this

535
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:44,079
order

536
00:17:40,319 --> 00:17:45,759
if not otherwise stated in the label

537
00:17:44,079 --> 00:17:47,439
so it really comes down to formulation

538
00:17:45,759 --> 00:17:49,279
and the properties of the products with

539
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:51,600
these specific formulation types and i

540
00:17:49,279 --> 00:17:53,599
highlighted those in yellow here so as

541
00:17:51,599 --> 00:17:55,839
we mentioned dry formulations require

542
00:17:53,599 --> 00:17:56,959
agitation the particles must break apart

543
00:17:55,839 --> 00:17:59,439
and must

544
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:00,880
dissolve in water

545
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:03,360
suspensions

546
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:05,200
um such as suspect emotions and

547
00:18:03,359 --> 00:18:07,279
suspension concentrates are suspended in

548
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,319
water with a thickener or pre-mixed with

549
00:18:07,279 --> 00:18:10,558
oils

550
00:18:08,319 --> 00:18:11,519
and that oil often stays in the tank's

551
00:18:10,558 --> 00:18:13,599
surface

552
00:18:11,519 --> 00:18:15,599
once you add those okay and then

553
00:18:13,599 --> 00:18:17,199
emulsifiable concentrates

554
00:18:15,599 --> 00:18:18,959
they contain surfactants in their

555
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,840
formulation that keep the oil droplets

556
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,120
small

557
00:18:19,839 --> 00:18:21,839
so we're kind of we're talking about two

558
00:18:21,119 --> 00:18:22,959
different things here we're talking

559
00:18:21,839 --> 00:18:24,798
about something that needs to disperse

560
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:26,400
in water and it's dry and then we're

561
00:18:24,798 --> 00:18:28,558
talking about you know other products

562
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:30,720
that have oils or thickeners in them and

563
00:18:28,558 --> 00:18:32,879
so you can imagine that if we were to

564
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:36,000
add the

565
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:36,000
dry ingredients

566
00:18:36,319 --> 00:18:40,240
second what would happen is they would

567
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:41,279
hit that oil that's already on top of

568
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,359
the tank

569
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:45,038
and then that oil would coat them right

570
00:18:43,359 --> 00:18:46,399
then they're going to sink down to the

571
00:18:45,038 --> 00:18:48,640
bottom they're not going to be able to

572
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,600
interact and disperse in the water

573
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:51,759
um

574
00:18:49,599 --> 00:18:55,558
and so that is why you want to add those

575
00:18:51,759 --> 00:18:55,558
dry ingredients first

576
00:18:56,558 --> 00:18:59,678
so after you add the products in this

577
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,200
order

578
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:02,160
the next thing you do when you're mixing

579
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,840
is you're going to add the remaining

580
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:06,798
water you're going to continue agitation

581
00:19:03,839 --> 00:19:08,399
until the tank mix appears uniform

582
00:19:06,798 --> 00:19:10,240
and then you want to measure the ph and

583
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:12,320
water hardness to determine the proper

584
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:13,599
levels of water conditioners or ammonium

585
00:19:12,319 --> 00:19:15,359
sulfate that you might need to add if

586
00:19:13,599 --> 00:19:17,359
the ph is out of range and while it's

587
00:19:15,359 --> 00:19:19,599
always a good rule of thumb to check the

588
00:19:17,359 --> 00:19:21,038
pa after you've mixed everything

589
00:19:19,599 --> 00:19:22,798
you want to keep in mind that ph

590
00:19:21,038 --> 00:19:24,400
adjusters are not always added at the

591
00:19:22,798 --> 00:19:25,918
end and the label will tell you when to

592
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:28,240
add them so you might have to add a

593
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:30,320
different time during the mixing process

594
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:31,679
we're going to talk about ph and also

595
00:19:30,319 --> 00:19:35,519
water hardness

596
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:35,519
a little bit later on in the talk

597
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:40,880
so we talked about the mixing order here

598
00:19:39,359 --> 00:19:42,719
but it's important to stress this is the

599
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:44,400
order to follow only if the product

600
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:45,839
labels do not have their own

601
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:48,320
instructions for mixing i think i've

602
00:19:45,839 --> 00:19:51,959
said that a couple times here but i want

603
00:19:48,319 --> 00:19:51,960
to give you an example

604
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,759
so my example is senstar and i heard

605
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:57,440
from a new york state extension

606
00:19:55,759 --> 00:19:59,679
associate with the cornell cooperative

607
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:01,038
extension vegetable program uh kristy

608
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:04,640
hopetig that

609
00:20:01,038 --> 00:20:06,720
this new product um sunstar you know for

610
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:08,320
control of onion thrips on onion among

611
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,759
other sites and pests had some tank

612
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:11,200
mixing issues

613
00:20:09,759 --> 00:20:13,759
and what was happening is it was forming

614
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:15,679
into a glob that had to be disposed of

615
00:20:13,759 --> 00:20:16,960
and you know we couldn't be sure exactly

616
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:18,159
what the source of these tank mixing

617
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,840
issues was

618
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:21,760
but when you look at the tank mixing

619
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:23,439
order on the senstar label you can see

620
00:20:21,759 --> 00:20:25,119
that it doesn't follow the generic

621
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:27,200
mixing order that i just showed you for

622
00:20:25,119 --> 00:20:28,959
most pesticides

623
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,400
so in fact it jumps around quite a bit

624
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,759
and you can see the numbers i have here

625
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,840
you know correspond to the generic

626
00:20:31,759 --> 00:20:35,519
mixing order so you can see that sensor

627
00:20:33,839 --> 00:20:37,759
label requires you to add oil

628
00:20:35,519 --> 00:20:39,279
dispersions in the third step and

629
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:41,038
typically this wouldn't happen until the

630
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:43,519
eighth step under the generic mixing

631
00:20:41,038 --> 00:20:45,599
order so things like this are exactly

632
00:20:43,519 --> 00:20:47,119
why it's really important to read the

633
00:20:45,599 --> 00:20:49,839
label to avoid

634
00:20:47,119 --> 00:20:49,839
incompatibility

635
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:56,559
so far we've just been talking about

636
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:58,960
mixing with water but what if your

637
00:20:56,558 --> 00:21:01,038
carrier is fertilizer what adjustments

638
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:02,960
should you make

639
00:21:01,038 --> 00:21:05,038
so most pesticide products are actually

640
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:08,079
designed to be used with water okay and

641
00:21:05,038 --> 00:21:11,119
water tends to be a better carrier than

642
00:21:08,079 --> 00:21:12,639
for those products and take mixtures

643
00:21:11,119 --> 00:21:13,918
one of the problems is that liquid

644
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:15,919
fertilizers are essentially a

645
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:17,520
concentrated salt solution and so

646
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:20,400
there's going to be less water available

647
00:21:17,519 --> 00:21:22,158
to help disperse your dry formulations

648
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:24,320
so incompatibility is more likely to

649
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:26,480
occur when you have fertilizer

650
00:21:24,319 --> 00:21:27,918
as your solution

651
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:31,200
and then the salts can also mix with

652
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:32,960
inert ingredients in your product

653
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,319
so knowing this

654
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:36,240
um

655
00:21:34,319 --> 00:21:38,240
it makes sense you see some changes to

656
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:39,200
the mixing order with fertilizer so

657
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,880
first you're going to see that you

658
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:43,200
should always conduct a jar test with

659
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:44,799
fertilizer as your carrier to avoid that

660
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:46,240
incompatibility

661
00:21:44,798 --> 00:21:49,440
also when you're using for lighter

662
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:51,599
carriers you never want to pre-mix crop

663
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:53,440
protection products in an inductor

664
00:21:51,599 --> 00:21:55,038
and some products are not designed to be

665
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:57,519
added directly to liquid fertilizer

666
00:21:55,038 --> 00:21:59,599
mixtures that's important to know

667
00:21:57,519 --> 00:22:01,119
similar to water carrier you want to

668
00:21:59,599 --> 00:22:02,558
make sure to agitate the fertilizer

669
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:04,319
mixture before adding the ingredients

670
00:22:02,558 --> 00:22:05,678
but it's even more important with

671
00:22:04,319 --> 00:22:07,678
fertilizer because things are less

672
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:09,440
likely to disperse

673
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:11,280
compared to water

674
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:13,679
also with fertilizer you always want to

675
00:22:11,279 --> 00:22:16,480
check for incompatibilities after mixing

676
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:18,240
because they're more likely to happen

677
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:19,919
and you know there's not a big change

678
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:22,558
here to the

679
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:23,759
order that you want to add your products

680
00:22:22,558 --> 00:22:26,079
um

681
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:28,000
in terms of you know formulation but

682
00:22:26,079 --> 00:22:29,678
you'll see that you are encouraged to

683
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,279
make these pre-slurries okay so with

684
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:32,400
fertilizer you want to make pre-slurries

685
00:22:31,279 --> 00:22:33,200
and water

686
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,559
um

687
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:37,120
with these

688
00:22:34,558 --> 00:22:38,639
dry products before you put them into

689
00:22:37,119 --> 00:22:40,239
the tank and that helps them dissolve

690
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:42,640
before they even go into the fertilizer

691
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:44,079
carrier

692
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:45,600
so let's talk about pre-stories a little

693
00:22:44,079 --> 00:22:47,279
bit more

694
00:22:45,599 --> 00:22:49,359
here these two pictures on the right

695
00:22:47,279 --> 00:22:51,279
show an example of a dry herbicide being

696
00:22:49,359 --> 00:22:52,479
added directly to urea and ammonium

697
00:22:51,279 --> 00:22:54,399
nitrate

698
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:56,798
on the top versus being mixed in a

699
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:58,400
pre-slurry with water and then add it to

700
00:22:56,798 --> 00:22:59,679
the fertilizer carrier on the bottom and

701
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:01,200
you can see that you know that

702
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:03,440
pre-slurry made a huge difference in

703
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:05,200
terms of dispersion uh why are there

704
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:07,759
still layers here well you know this

705
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:09,759
hasn't been agitated yet okay so

706
00:23:07,759 --> 00:23:11,038
that would help get rid of the layers

707
00:23:09,759 --> 00:23:13,839
but you can see freezers are really

708
00:23:11,038 --> 00:23:15,759
important for fertilizer carriers

709
00:23:13,839 --> 00:23:18,639
and remember when you're mixing a

710
00:23:15,759 --> 00:23:20,240
pre-slurry you want to reduce exposure

711
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:22,480
okay there's going to be an inhalation

712
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:23,679
hazard with those dry ingredients

713
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,440
there's going to be increased risk of

714
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:27,600
splashing and sloshing because you're

715
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:30,080
mixing in an open bucket so pay

716
00:23:27,599 --> 00:23:31,519
attention to label language um and you

717
00:23:30,079 --> 00:23:33,678
know make sure to wear

718
00:23:31,519 --> 00:23:36,240
ppe including gloves eye and skin

719
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:37,600
protection in case of splashing and take

720
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:39,839
extra care when you pour that into the

721
00:23:37,599 --> 00:23:39,839
tank

722
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:44,159
so now that we've talked about

723
00:23:42,558 --> 00:23:45,519
the mixing order for both water and

724
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:46,799
fertilizer

725
00:23:45,519 --> 00:23:48,079
let's discuss

726
00:23:46,798 --> 00:23:49,759
the three main things you want to be

727
00:23:48,079 --> 00:23:50,879
aware of

728
00:23:49,759 --> 00:23:52,240
so we're going to talk about mixing

729
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:54,240
correctly

730
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:56,159
and the first thing we'll talk about is

731
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:59,038
carrier volume

732
00:23:56,159 --> 00:24:00,320
so just like when you're adding sugar to

733
00:23:59,038 --> 00:24:02,720
your tea

734
00:24:00,319 --> 00:24:04,558
right if you don't have enough water

735
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:06,880
that sugar is going to precipitate out

736
00:24:04,558 --> 00:24:08,798
and not dissolve and it'll end up at the

737
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:10,880
bottom of your cup so this is similar

738
00:24:08,798 --> 00:24:12,558
with pesticides okay and so you have to

739
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:14,640
make sure to add the right amount of

740
00:24:12,558 --> 00:24:15,678
water pesticides will dissolve

741
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:17,759
otherwise you're going to eat product

742
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:19,200
clumping at the bottom

743
00:24:17,759 --> 00:24:20,720
typically the directions on the label

744
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,679
state the tank should be half full of

745
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:23,278
water

746
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:26,720
and three ports full of fertilizer

747
00:24:23,278 --> 00:24:26,720
before you add the first product

748
00:24:27,839 --> 00:24:30,879
next let's go let's talk about wait time

749
00:24:29,599 --> 00:24:33,199
and we already went over wait time a

750
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:34,640
little bit but you just want to make

751
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:36,159
sure to check that each of your products

752
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:39,038
have mixed that had enough time to mix

753
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:41,120
before you add the next one

754
00:24:39,038 --> 00:24:43,440
you want to agitate those products

755
00:24:41,119 --> 00:24:44,879
before you add another product

756
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,558
especially when the active ingredients

757
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:48,400
do not disperse or suspend quickly in

758
00:24:46,558 --> 00:24:50,079
water and keep in mind that a product

759
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:51,759
may appear to have dispersed when it

760
00:24:50,079 --> 00:24:53,038
actually hasn't completely dissolved so

761
00:24:51,759 --> 00:24:55,679
even though it appears dissolves it

762
00:24:53,038 --> 00:24:56,480
actually might need a little more time

763
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:58,400
um

764
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:00,720
and then note that mixing time can be a

765
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:03,919
lot slower when water is colder we're

766
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:07,679
going to talk about that in a second

767
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:08,960
finally let's discuss agitation

768
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:11,600
so you want to agitate your tank

769
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:13,120
mixtures moderately before and during

770
00:25:11,599 --> 00:25:15,839
spray applications so what i mean by

771
00:25:13,119 --> 00:25:17,038
moderate agitation well if you're doing

772
00:25:15,839 --> 00:25:18,480
moderate agitation you're going to be

773
00:25:17,038 --> 00:25:20,000
able to see that top layer of your

774
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:22,880
mixture moving when you look into the

775
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:25,200
tank if it looks like boiling water

776
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:27,679
that's too much agitation

777
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:29,600
why is it so important to not over under

778
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:31,278
agitate

779
00:25:29,599 --> 00:25:32,959
okay if you over agitate what you're

780
00:25:31,278 --> 00:25:34,640
going to get is dry product formulations

781
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:37,440
will foam when they remain at the top

782
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:39,440
and they'll swell and sink

783
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:43,840
and that can lead to uneven dispersion

784
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:43,840
or even clogged and stop pumps

785
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:47,440
you can also get

786
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,839
pesticides dislodging from their

787
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:51,679
surfactants and this can destabilize the

788
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:53,359
mixture and you can get clumping and

789
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:56,798
cottage cheese

790
00:25:53,359 --> 00:25:58,798
and then anti-drift agents can shear

791
00:25:56,798 --> 00:26:00,960
if things are over agitated and that

792
00:25:58,798 --> 00:26:03,599
will lead to diminishing effectiveness

793
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:05,360
during the course of application

794
00:26:03,599 --> 00:26:07,278
so moderate agitation and also adding

795
00:26:05,359 --> 00:26:09,119
that anti-foaming agent should help

796
00:26:07,278 --> 00:26:11,038
ensure that products are dispersed

797
00:26:09,119 --> 00:26:13,599
without foaming

798
00:26:11,038 --> 00:26:15,359
now you can also under mix your products

799
00:26:13,599 --> 00:26:16,719
and under agitate them

800
00:26:15,359 --> 00:26:18,399
and what happens then is that you're

801
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:20,159
going to see things settling out over

802
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:21,919
time just like you'd see with italian

803
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:23,679
salad dressing breaking into layers

804
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:25,360
right and if particles remain settled

805
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:27,519
out for too long it can be difficult or

806
00:26:25,359 --> 00:26:30,319
impossible to resuspend them this can

807
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:32,639
lead to obstructed hoses or piping

808
00:26:30,319 --> 00:26:33,918
and for liquid active ingredients before

809
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:35,200
you add them you want to check the

810
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:37,440
container of the storage tank to make

811
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:39,120
sure that mixture is mixed in the tank

812
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:40,960
right before you even add it or sorry in

813
00:26:39,119 --> 00:26:41,839
the container before you even enter the

814
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:43,440
tank

815
00:26:41,839 --> 00:26:46,000
and this should help keep things evenly

816
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:46,000
distributed

817
00:26:46,319 --> 00:26:49,519
so i just want to give you an agitation

818
00:26:47,759 --> 00:26:51,919
example and this is from a professor in

819
00:26:49,519 --> 00:26:55,158
plant pathology microbiology his name is

820
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:58,320
dr david rosenberger and he was using

821
00:26:55,159 --> 00:27:00,240
nordx75wg it's a fungicide for selecting

822
00:26:58,319 --> 00:27:01,839
buying crops and field and veg crops in

823
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:04,000
greenhouse ornamental

824
00:27:01,839 --> 00:27:05,038
so you can see that the nordocs label

825
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,038
language

826
00:27:05,038 --> 00:27:09,759
it states agitate the mixture to

827
00:27:07,038 --> 00:27:11,679
maintain a uniform suspension and david

828
00:27:09,759 --> 00:27:14,640
ran into problems trying to apply this

829
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:16,080
product with poor agitation okay so the

830
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:18,240
product settled to the bottom of the

831
00:27:16,079 --> 00:27:19,839
tank it remained as a sludge

832
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:21,359
after the liquid was sprayed out and so

833
00:27:19,839 --> 00:27:23,839
in david's case he said just reviewing

834
00:27:21,359 --> 00:27:25,918
that statement on the label or even a 10

835
00:27:23,839 --> 00:27:27,278
to 15 minute jar test would have

836
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:29,038
forewarned him of the settling problems

837
00:27:27,278 --> 00:27:32,000
beforehand we're going to talk about jar

838
00:27:29,038 --> 00:27:32,000
tests later on

839
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:35,600
so the next thing you want to think

840
00:27:34,079 --> 00:27:37,119
about is the properties of your carrier

841
00:27:35,599 --> 00:27:38,879
and those can greatly influence

842
00:27:37,119 --> 00:27:41,359
compatibility we're first going to talk

843
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:44,240
about ph

844
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:47,119
so ph just measures the degree to which

845
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:48,399
a substance is acidic or basic

846
00:27:47,119 --> 00:27:51,038
so lemon juice

847
00:27:48,398 --> 00:27:52,639
for example has a ph of 2. it's pretty

848
00:27:51,038 --> 00:27:55,278
acidic

849
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:57,679
ammonia has a ph of 12 and it's more

850
00:27:55,278 --> 00:28:00,640
basic and then water is supposed to have

851
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:02,159
a ph that's close to neutral or 7 but

852
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:04,559
we're going to talk about how this is

853
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:06,799
not always true

854
00:28:04,558 --> 00:28:08,720
so most pesticides perform best if your

855
00:28:06,798 --> 00:28:11,038
carrier's ph is you know four to six

856
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:13,440
point five or so okay so they do better

857
00:28:11,038 --> 00:28:14,960
in slightly acidic conditions uh one

858
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:17,440
exception would be the

859
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:20,319
cell phone urea herbicides and they

860
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:22,399
perform best at slightly basic

861
00:28:20,319 --> 00:28:24,079
ph of seven to eight

862
00:28:22,398 --> 00:28:26,479
when your ph is out of range for your

863
00:28:24,079 --> 00:28:28,000
particular pesticide products can fall

864
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:29,919
out of solution they can degrade and

865
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,759
decompose and this will happen faster if

866
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:33,759
the ph is more extreme or the

867
00:28:31,759 --> 00:28:36,079
temperature is higher and they can also

868
00:28:33,759 --> 00:28:38,480
lose their electrical charge and this

869
00:28:36,079 --> 00:28:41,359
can reduce the product penetration into

870
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:44,480
weeds so reduce efficacy so clearly it's

871
00:28:41,359 --> 00:28:46,158
really important that your ph be optimal

872
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:48,000
for pesticides to be effective and to

873
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:49,679
ensure they're compatible how do you

874
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,640
make sure that the ph is addressed

875
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:53,919
properly when you're tank mixing

876
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:56,640
okay i don't want you to get overwhelmed

877
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:58,080
by this chart but i want you to realize

878
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:00,320
that you know the ph of your water

879
00:28:58,079 --> 00:29:02,398
sources can be really variable and so

880
00:29:00,319 --> 00:29:05,119
this was a chart from a study that was

881
00:29:02,398 --> 00:29:06,719
done in 1986 um and basically what it's

882
00:29:05,119 --> 00:29:08,479
showing there's ph for different water

883
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:10,000
sources in the fruit growing regions of

884
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:11,278
new york state

885
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,278
okay so you have these different regions

886
00:29:11,278 --> 00:29:14,880
and you can see the ph ranges and what i

887
00:29:13,278 --> 00:29:16,880
want you to focus on is really just that

888
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:19,679
the range is so variable in some of

889
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:22,159
these similar regions and then across

890
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:24,240
the season you can also see that uh you

891
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:26,000
see a difference in the ph range you

892
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:27,759
know from summer to fall spring in these

893
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,798
same areas

894
00:29:27,759 --> 00:29:32,720
okay so ph can shift both seasonally and

895
00:29:30,798 --> 00:29:34,960
within the same place and a lot of times

896
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:36,240
these shifts especially in surface water

897
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:37,679
um

898
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:39,359
can be because of sediments and

899
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:40,399
microorganisms and minerals that are in

900
00:29:39,359 --> 00:29:42,240
flux

901
00:29:40,398 --> 00:29:44,398
okay but the bottom line is just don't

902
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:47,038
assume that you know the ph even if you

903
00:29:44,398 --> 00:29:48,479
tested it you know last year okay you

904
00:29:47,038 --> 00:29:50,000
need to be testing your water source

905
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:51,440
really frequently

906
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,440
and so you want to measure the ph of

907
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:56,080
your water sources several times

908
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:57,840
throughout the season you want to test

909
00:29:56,079 --> 00:29:59,278
your water probably a couple weeks

910
00:29:57,839 --> 00:30:00,319
before your spray regime begins and

911
00:29:59,278 --> 00:30:01,839
that'll give you time to kind of

912
00:30:00,319 --> 00:30:03,278
evaluate your water make sure you know

913
00:30:01,839 --> 00:30:04,398
which products will be optimal with your

914
00:30:03,278 --> 00:30:06,640
water source

915
00:30:04,398 --> 00:30:08,639
and also which ph adjusters or adjuvants

916
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:10,080
you might want to have on hand

917
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:12,720
and to measure ph you can use an

918
00:30:10,079 --> 00:30:14,639
electronic ph meter or ph dye strips and

919
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:17,679
both of those can be found

920
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:17,679
pretty easily online

921
00:30:17,759 --> 00:30:22,079
also labels may direct you to measure ph

922
00:30:20,398 --> 00:30:23,519
at different times during the mixing

923
00:30:22,079 --> 00:30:25,678
process

924
00:30:23,519 --> 00:30:28,480
okay but you always want to measure ph

925
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:28,480
after mixing

926
00:30:29,359 --> 00:30:32,639
and then you want to add your ph

927
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:33,759
adjusters if you need to adjust the ph

928
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:35,360
with care

929
00:30:33,759 --> 00:30:38,000
okay ph adjusters like water

930
00:30:35,359 --> 00:30:39,678
conditioners or adjuvants um

931
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,919
you know they might be prohibited by the

932
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:43,200
label and sometimes just specific ones

933
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:44,399
are prohibited so you want to make sure

934
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:46,399
that what you add is effective and

935
00:30:44,398 --> 00:30:48,479
compatible with your product

936
00:30:46,398 --> 00:30:50,319
acidifiers can be

937
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:52,240
they can lower the ph of the tank

938
00:30:50,319 --> 00:30:53,519
sometimes they can lower it too much

939
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,880
okay and that can cause your active

940
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:59,200
ingredients to precipitate out of

941
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:59,200
solution or even volatilize oh hi

942
00:30:59,599 --> 00:31:04,000
hello

943
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:05,919
karen i think that you are i'm just

944
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,159
going to mute karen here unless you had

945
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:09,759
a question

946
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:10,640
all right

947
00:31:09,759 --> 00:31:11,839
um

948
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:13,679
so you want to keep in mind that the

949
00:31:11,839 --> 00:31:16,319
label may require adding adding the

950
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:18,640
conditioner first or at some other time

951
00:31:16,319 --> 00:31:22,319
during the mixing process okay so don't

952
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:22,320
assume that you always add at the end

953
00:31:22,398 --> 00:31:26,319
and you should be aware of product

954
00:31:24,079 --> 00:31:29,038
degradation over time as well with

955
00:31:26,319 --> 00:31:31,519
different ph okay so an active

956
00:31:29,038 --> 00:31:33,679
ingredient can become ineffective after

957
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:36,159
10 hours when the ph is five but it can

958
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:37,919
only last you two minutes at a ph of

959
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:39,519
nine okay these aren't exact numbers i'm

960
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:41,120
giving you but it really can be

961
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:44,079
dramatically different

962
00:31:41,119 --> 00:31:46,558
um so purdue university's extension

963
00:31:44,079 --> 00:31:49,038
publication that i was looking over

964
00:31:46,558 --> 00:31:51,119
shares these following rules of thumb

965
00:31:49,038 --> 00:31:54,240
for most pesticides okay so if your

966
00:31:51,119 --> 00:31:55,359
mixture is you know 3.5 to 6 ph

967
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:57,599
you're going to want to apply that

968
00:31:55,359 --> 00:31:59,678
mixture within 12 to 24 hours

969
00:31:57,599 --> 00:32:01,038
if your ph is a little closer to neutral

970
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:01,919
you want to apply it within one to two

971
00:32:01,038 --> 00:32:03,599
hours

972
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:05,360
and if your ph is more than seven you

973
00:32:03,599 --> 00:32:07,519
want to apply that immediately and

974
00:32:05,359 --> 00:32:09,759
remember this rule of thumb is only for

975
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:13,038
uh you know most pesticides we talked

976
00:32:09,759 --> 00:32:15,119
about how most pesticides do well

977
00:32:13,038 --> 00:32:18,000
and the ph is a little more acidic so

978
00:32:15,119 --> 00:32:20,158
the sulfonylureal herbicides uh wouldn't

979
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,919
match these timeframes

980
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:24,559
but this just gives you an idea that you

981
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:26,320
know things can really degrade over time

982
00:32:24,558 --> 00:32:29,038
and the best rule of thumb of course is

983
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:31,918
to just mix right before you apply you

984
00:32:29,038 --> 00:32:33,440
don't have to worry about any of this

985
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:35,679
um

986
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:37,360
the label will not always mention water

987
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:38,240
ph okay

988
00:32:37,359 --> 00:32:39,599
so

989
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:41,679
that doesn't mean it won't cause an

990
00:32:39,599 --> 00:32:43,519
incompatibility problem what's going to

991
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:45,679
happen often is the manufacturer just

992
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:47,440
might assume that your water ph will be

993
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:49,278
in a normal range and they may not be

994
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:51,120
able to warn you you know about an out

995
00:32:49,278 --> 00:32:52,880
of range ph issue because they're not

996
00:32:51,119 --> 00:32:55,879
assuming that you have an out of range

997
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:55,880
ph

998
00:32:56,159 --> 00:33:01,120
and you want to avoid mixing pesticides

999
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:02,319
with radically different ph requirements

1000
00:33:01,119 --> 00:33:04,239
because what would happen is that you're

1001
00:33:02,319 --> 00:33:05,839
always trying to condition for one

1002
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:07,440
pesticide and that would mean that

1003
00:33:05,839 --> 00:33:08,879
you're kind of reducing the efficacy and

1004
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:11,600
performance of the other right they're

1005
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:14,880
if they're radically different needs for

1006
00:33:11,599 --> 00:33:16,798
the ph range so for instance li 700 can

1007
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:19,200
help acidify spray water so products

1008
00:33:16,798 --> 00:33:21,599
like captain and median don't degrade so

1009
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:23,159
that's useful for captain and edan but

1010
00:33:21,599 --> 00:33:25,519
if he were to mix

1011
00:33:23,159 --> 00:33:27,559
li-700 with copper fungicides for

1012
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:30,720
instance for instance um that can cause

1013
00:33:27,558 --> 00:33:32,319
phytotoxicity at low ph right so you

1014
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:33,278
really have to be careful

1015
00:33:32,319 --> 00:33:34,960
um

1016
00:33:33,278 --> 00:33:36,960
and you should just avoid mixing

1017
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:39,679
pesticides that have radically different

1018
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:43,759
ph requirements

1019
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:43,759
so next we'll talk about water hardness

1020
00:33:44,798 --> 00:33:50,000
another factor that can influence

1021
00:33:46,558 --> 00:33:52,158
compatibility is water hardness

1022
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:55,200
so negatively charged pesticide

1023
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:58,000
molecules have a tendency to attach or

1024
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:59,759
attract to positively charged cat ion

1025
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,640
cations that are naturally found in

1026
00:33:59,759 --> 00:34:02,158
water

1027
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:05,519
so these include things like aluminum

1028
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:07,278
iron calcium sodium and magnesium

1029
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:09,760
the pesticides that bind with these

1030
00:34:07,278 --> 00:34:10,800
minerals can actually precipitate out of

1031
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:12,320
solution

1032
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,919
or they might be less likely to enter

1033
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:16,480
the target test

1034
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:19,358
so weak acid herbicides like glyphosate

1035
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:21,599
or dodean or 24d and dicamba

1036
00:34:19,358 --> 00:34:24,319
are more susceptible to incompatibility

1037
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:26,079
in hard water

1038
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:27,359
and you can see from this map i have in

1039
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:29,359
the u.s

1040
00:34:27,358 --> 00:34:32,960
that the natural concentration of these

1041
00:34:29,358 --> 00:34:35,199
minerals in hard water so water hardness

1042
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:37,039
red is like the most hard water right it

1043
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:38,799
really varies across the country you can

1044
00:34:37,039 --> 00:34:40,800
see the hardest water is sort of in the

1045
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:42,960
middle of the country uh a little bit

1046
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:44,480
more out west from us but you can also

1047
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:46,800
if you look at new york state there's

1048
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:49,440
some red parts of our state

1049
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:51,200
okay and there's a lot of variation with

1050
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:53,119
across our state so you really want to

1051
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:56,319
be careful that you know what the water

1052
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:56,320
hardness is where you are

1053
00:34:57,039 --> 00:35:00,559
so let's take a pause here and think

1054
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:02,720
about why would water hardness render

1055
00:35:00,559 --> 00:35:04,559
pesticides ineffective

1056
00:35:02,719 --> 00:35:06,639
so what i'm showing here is uh two

1057
00:35:04,559 --> 00:35:08,159
containers the one on the left contains

1058
00:35:06,639 --> 00:35:10,719
distilled water

1059
00:35:08,159 --> 00:35:11,838
uh so it has zero water hardness and the

1060
00:35:10,719 --> 00:35:13,759
one on the right

1061
00:35:11,838 --> 00:35:16,159
contains hard water a lot of minerals

1062
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:18,000
concentration okay and a material that

1063
00:35:16,159 --> 00:35:19,759
mimics glyphosate is going to be added

1064
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:22,719
to both these bottles and you'll notice

1065
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:24,240
that the water on the left remains clear

1066
00:35:22,719 --> 00:35:26,639
and this indicates that the added

1067
00:35:24,239 --> 00:35:28,000
product is in solution okay so that's

1068
00:35:26,639 --> 00:35:30,000
what you want

1069
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,760
the water on the right is cloudy and

1070
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,679
what this is indicating is that the

1071
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:35,760
calcium has actually bound to the

1072
00:35:33,679 --> 00:35:36,719
glyphosate mimic okay

1073
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:38,480
and so

1074
00:35:36,719 --> 00:35:39,519
if the mixture on the right were to be

1075
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:41,440
applied

1076
00:35:39,519 --> 00:35:43,199
there would not be any glyphosate

1077
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:45,119
available to act on your weeds because

1078
00:35:43,199 --> 00:35:47,039
it would have already bound to the hard

1079
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:48,880
water

1080
00:35:47,039 --> 00:35:50,400
even if you're adding the full rate to

1081
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:52,400
your tank you're just not going to get

1082
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:53,920
any efficacy because it's bound to the

1083
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:55,920
hard water and of course if you think

1084
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:57,599
about this this is like on a continuum

1085
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:58,880
right so if you have a really high

1086
00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:00,160
concentration

1087
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:01,599
um you're going to see something like

1088
00:36:00,159 --> 00:36:03,039
this where it's completely ineffective

1089
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:04,800
but there might be

1090
00:36:03,039 --> 00:36:07,039
different degrees of

1091
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:09,519
efficacy depending on how hard your

1092
00:36:07,039 --> 00:36:09,519
water is

1093
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:13,119
so to avoid water hardness issues you'll

1094
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:14,720
want to measure water hardness with

1095
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:16,480
commercially available water testing

1096
00:36:14,719 --> 00:36:18,159
kits

1097
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:20,559
and if your water is out of the normal

1098
00:36:18,159 --> 00:36:23,440
range water softeners like ammonium

1099
00:36:20,559 --> 00:36:25,199
sulfate or ams and ammonium thiosulfate

1100
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:26,880
can counter the effects of hardness but

1101
00:36:25,199 --> 00:36:30,000
you want to be careful because adding

1102
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:31,838
ams to things like ec formulations can

1103
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,960
sometimes result in phytotoxicity and

1104
00:36:31,838 --> 00:36:34,159
hopefully

1105
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:36,720
you know it should be on the label

1106
00:36:34,159 --> 00:36:38,559
language so here's an example this is

1107
00:36:36,719 --> 00:36:41,199
angenia this product is an herbicide

1108
00:36:38,559 --> 00:36:42,480
listed for dt soybean new york

1109
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:44,799
and there's instructions to use a

1110
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:47,519
conditioning agent if your water iron

1111
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:48,560
content's above 500 ppm so you have hard

1112
00:36:47,519 --> 00:36:50,400
water you're like all right i'm going to

1113
00:36:48,559 --> 00:36:52,320
use this conditioning agent but the

1114
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:56,400
label dictates not to use the more

1115
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:57,519
common ones so ams or uan and instead um

1116
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,880
you have to use conditioners that are

1117
00:36:57,519 --> 00:37:00,480
pre-approved for ingenious you actually

1118
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:01,599
have to go look those up right and i

1119
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:03,679
think they're in a different section of

1120
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:05,760
the label but this is really important

1121
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:08,559
also in this label there's a statement

1122
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:10,240
that talks about noting that the ph

1123
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:11,599
buffering agent that's required for this

1124
00:37:10,239 --> 00:37:13,279
product okay

1125
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:15,200
so there's a you you know this is

1126
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:18,000
another exception of why there's so many

1127
00:37:15,199 --> 00:37:19,039
uh exceptions and complications another

1128
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:22,079
example

1129
00:37:19,039 --> 00:37:23,519
of why you have to check the label

1130
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:25,839
we're also going to talk about water

1131
00:37:23,519 --> 00:37:28,159
turbidity

1132
00:37:25,838 --> 00:37:30,400
so water hardness was when negatively

1133
00:37:28,159 --> 00:37:31,759
charged pesticides were attracted to cat

1134
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,880
ions and weren't available to act in

1135
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:34,640
your pests

1136
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:36,480
with water turbidity what you have is

1137
00:37:34,639 --> 00:37:38,480
positively charged pesticides that are

1138
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:40,559
attracted to and bind

1139
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:41,760
um to negatively charged particles in

1140
00:37:40,559 --> 00:37:43,199
your water

1141
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,720
so what are the negatively charged

1142
00:37:43,199 --> 00:37:47,519
particles that are in your water well

1143
00:37:44,719 --> 00:37:49,598
they're things like soil sediment

1144
00:37:47,519 --> 00:37:51,759
so in general just do not mix pesticides

1145
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:53,200
with water that is visibly muddy or

1146
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:54,640
murky because this will lead to

1147
00:37:53,199 --> 00:37:55,759
incompatibility

1148
00:37:54,639 --> 00:37:56,799
or could

1149
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:58,320
um

1150
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:00,079
sometimes a label will talk about

1151
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:02,160
turbidity issues you probably can't see

1152
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:03,599
this as well but this is glyphosate plus

1153
00:38:02,159 --> 00:38:05,598
and the label states

1154
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:07,519
reduced results may occur if water

1155
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:09,280
containing soil is used such as visibly

1156
00:38:07,519 --> 00:38:12,400
muddy water or water from ponds and

1157
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:12,400
ditches that it's not clear

1158
00:38:14,639 --> 00:38:17,440
and last when we're thinking about

1159
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:19,838
carrier properties let's talk about

1160
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:19,838
temperature

1161
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:23,920
so water temperature influences the rate

1162
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:26,000
at which products dissolve disperse

1163
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:27,680
emulsify and flow

1164
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:30,159
and more materials will dissolve in

1165
00:38:27,679 --> 00:38:32,399
warmer water than in colder water

1166
00:38:30,159 --> 00:38:34,159
you can see this diagram here the cold

1167
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:35,760
water is just not moving as fast so it's

1168
00:38:34,159 --> 00:38:37,279
not going to be able to bump into your

1169
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:38,400
pesticides as much and interact with

1170
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:39,680
them as much

1171
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:42,000
and that's why they don't dissolve as

1172
00:38:39,679 --> 00:38:44,399
much as they do with warm water

1173
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,920
when you have cold or water dry and

1174
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:48,240
liquid flowable formulations will take

1175
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:51,039
longer to disperse

1176
00:38:48,239 --> 00:38:53,199
ecs crop oil and seed oil formulations

1177
00:38:51,039 --> 00:38:55,358
will form gels and kind of distribute

1178
00:38:53,199 --> 00:38:57,519
unevenly in the tank

1179
00:38:55,358 --> 00:38:58,799
and water-soluble packets may not

1180
00:38:57,519 --> 00:39:01,199
dissolve as easily they may take a

1181
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:03,280
really long time to dissolve

1182
00:39:01,199 --> 00:39:06,078
so how do you avoid compatibility issues

1183
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:07,440
with cold water

1184
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:09,680
if you're working with colder water

1185
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:11,358
you'll want to agitate the water more

1186
00:39:09,679 --> 00:39:12,879
you're going to wait for longer for

1187
00:39:11,358 --> 00:39:14,639
those products to dissolve

1188
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:16,480
and you maybe even want to create pretty

1189
00:39:14,639 --> 00:39:18,078
slurries in warmer water to ensure the

1190
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:19,599
products are distributing evenly so you

1191
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:22,400
put them in warm water first before you

1192
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:24,480
add them to the cold tank water

1193
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:26,480
and keep in mind that temperature is

1194
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:28,079
usually not addressed on the label

1195
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:29,760
because it's assumed that you're working

1196
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:31,280
with water that's within the right

1197
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:34,079
temperature range

1198
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:35,280
so how cold is too cold

1199
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:36,640
unfortunately there's not enough

1200
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:38,960
research on this for me to really give

1201
00:39:36,639 --> 00:39:39,759
you an exact range hopefully more comes

1202
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:41,920
out

1203
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:44,000
but what i can show you is research data

1204
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:45,358
purdue which is summarizing this table

1205
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,400
so what they did in the study is they

1206
00:39:45,358 --> 00:39:48,319
mix the

1207
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:50,639
you know the following herbicides here

1208
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:51,920
with different temperature water and the

1209
00:39:50,639 --> 00:39:53,759
extras show where the herbicide

1210
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:55,358
performance was reduced and maybe it

1211
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:56,800
wasn't reduced completely but you know

1212
00:39:55,358 --> 00:39:59,440
it was reduced in some way for at least

1213
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:01,359
some weed species and the checks show

1214
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:03,119
where their products were effective

1215
00:40:01,358 --> 00:40:05,598
and so you even though they only tested

1216
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:07,358
four products this information you know

1217
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:09,519
could help you think about things

1218
00:40:07,358 --> 00:40:12,239
because what you're seeing is that

1219
00:40:09,519 --> 00:40:14,000
you know if the water's at 72

1220
00:40:12,239 --> 00:40:15,838
these herbicides were effective and then

1221
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:18,079
it wasn't when the water was as cold as

1222
00:40:15,838 --> 00:40:20,078
41. and so as your water gets farther

1223
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:21,440
away from 72 and closer to 41 you're

1224
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:23,680
going to want to think about increasing

1225
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:24,720
agitation waiting longer for products to

1226
00:40:23,679 --> 00:40:26,960
dissolve

1227
00:40:24,719 --> 00:40:29,279
and creating those pre-slurries and warm

1228
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:29,280
water

1229
00:40:29,358 --> 00:40:32,318
one of the most important tools that you

1230
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:34,800
have at your disposal to avoid

1231
00:40:32,318 --> 00:40:36,800
incompatibility is to test before you

1232
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:39,200
mix in the tank with a small amount of

1233
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:40,880
product with the jar test

1234
00:40:39,199 --> 00:40:42,799
you're probably familiar with these but

1235
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:44,400
you should always conduct a jar chest if

1236
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:46,079
you're mixing products that you have not

1237
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:48,079
mixed before because you don't know if

1238
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:49,680
those will be incompatible you don't

1239
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:51,920
want to experiment with an untested tank

1240
00:40:49,679 --> 00:40:53,759
mixing data application you should also

1241
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:56,000
do periodic jar tests with products that

1242
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:58,000
you actually have mixed already this is

1243
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,519
because manufacturers can often change

1244
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,480
the inert ingredients that are in their

1245
00:40:59,519 --> 00:41:01,440
products

1246
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:03,119
and

1247
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:04,800
sometimes another factor such as your

1248
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:07,280
carrier ph or water hardness could

1249
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:08,800
change over time and that might impact

1250
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:12,000
compatibility the jar test could

1251
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:14,318
actually catch that for you right

1252
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,519
remember there's no recovery once you've

1253
00:41:14,318 --> 00:41:17,838
mixed things in the tank if you're

1254
00:41:15,519 --> 00:41:19,679
having incompatibility issues um or

1255
00:41:17,838 --> 00:41:21,358
often no recovery right the jar test can

1256
00:41:19,679 --> 00:41:24,078
really save you from losing product and

1257
00:41:21,358 --> 00:41:25,519
having a mess to clean up

1258
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:26,960
when you do a jar test you're looking

1259
00:41:25,519 --> 00:41:28,480
for the following indicators of

1260
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:30,079
incompatibility and we talked about you

1261
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:31,920
know it's really hard to flag chemical

1262
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:33,680
incompatibility you often can't see it

1263
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:34,880
but sometimes the mixture will give off

1264
00:41:33,679 --> 00:41:36,559
heat

1265
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:38,000
um or sometimes you're going to see

1266
00:41:36,559 --> 00:41:39,838
something looking cloudy kind of like

1267
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:41,760
that glyphosate hard water example that

1268
00:41:39,838 --> 00:41:43,759
i showed you

1269
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:45,200
so you might be able to catch chemical

1270
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:46,319
incompatibility certainly you're going

1271
00:41:45,199 --> 00:41:48,000
to be able to catch physical

1272
00:41:46,318 --> 00:41:49,440
incompatibilities

1273
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,559
um

1274
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:52,318
you know you're going to see layers

1275
00:41:50,559 --> 00:41:54,318
forming or the mixture isn't uniform if

1276
00:41:52,318 --> 00:41:55,519
particles are floating or foaming maybe

1277
00:41:54,318 --> 00:41:56,800
you're going to see residue accumulating

1278
00:41:55,519 --> 00:41:58,318
on the sides of the container or

1279
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:59,440
material that just takes a really long

1280
00:41:58,318 --> 00:42:00,639
time just

1281
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:03,039
to

1282
00:42:00,639 --> 00:42:05,519
settle to the bottom

1283
00:42:03,039 --> 00:42:06,880
or larger particles are present that

1284
00:42:05,519 --> 00:42:09,759
would not fit through your screens

1285
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:10,960
filters or nozzles

1286
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:12,560
when you conduct the jar test you're

1287
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:14,079
going to use the exact same water that

1288
00:42:12,559 --> 00:42:15,920
you use in the tank

1289
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:17,680
because you know we know that water ph

1290
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:18,720
hardness uh turbidity can all make a

1291
00:42:17,679 --> 00:42:19,838
difference

1292
00:42:18,719 --> 00:42:21,759
and then

1293
00:42:19,838 --> 00:42:23,838
you know the labels usually tell you uh

1294
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:25,440
how to do a jar test but it usually

1295
00:42:23,838 --> 00:42:27,519
involves measuring cups and glass or

1296
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:28,960
plastic containers and don't reuse those

1297
00:42:27,519 --> 00:42:31,960
for other purposes right just for

1298
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:34,720
pesticides and you can purchase chemical

1299
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:37,039
compatibility test kits online if you

1300
00:42:34,719 --> 00:42:38,719
need to with all the supplies needed

1301
00:42:37,039 --> 00:42:40,000
to conduct the test you're going to mix

1302
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:41,838
the appropriate amounts of carrier and

1303
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:43,679
pesticide you're going to make sure you

1304
00:42:41,838 --> 00:42:45,679
use enough water and you would start by

1305
00:42:43,679 --> 00:42:48,078
adding what you know the carrier that's

1306
00:42:45,679 --> 00:42:49,199
needed about one-fifth to one-half carry

1307
00:42:48,079 --> 00:42:50,640
needed you're going to mix the

1308
00:42:49,199 --> 00:42:52,239
proportionate amount of pesticides in

1309
00:42:50,639 --> 00:42:53,440
the recommended order

1310
00:42:52,239 --> 00:42:54,879
then you're going to add the rest of the

1311
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:56,480
carrier and you invert the container

1312
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:57,680
after adding a product

1313
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:59,039
once you've mixed your products in the

1314
00:42:57,679 --> 00:43:01,679
jar you're going to let it stand for at

1315
00:42:59,039 --> 00:43:03,519
least 30 minutes now if you can let it

1316
00:43:01,679 --> 00:43:05,358
stand for longer that'll give you more

1317
00:43:03,519 --> 00:43:07,920
information if a pesticide were to

1318
00:43:05,358 --> 00:43:10,318
degrade overnight for instance if your

1319
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:11,599
jar test can go overnight

1320
00:43:10,318 --> 00:43:13,039
and maybe you know that's how long your

1321
00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:14,318
mixture is going to be in the tank that

1322
00:43:13,039 --> 00:43:18,239
would really let you know if you're

1323
00:43:14,318 --> 00:43:18,239
going to have an incompatibility issue

1324
00:43:19,199 --> 00:43:23,838
and to drive home why you need enough

1325
00:43:20,719 --> 00:43:24,639
water here in the left we have

1326
00:43:23,838 --> 00:43:26,078
um

1327
00:43:24,639 --> 00:43:28,078
you know pesticide products touchdown

1328
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:30,400
and flexstar mixed with

1329
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:32,240
liquid ams and water on the left we only

1330
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:33,599
have 25 milliliters of water and on the

1331
00:43:32,239 --> 00:43:35,519
right we have the recommended 80

1332
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:37,680
milliliters of water you know it's just

1333
00:43:35,519 --> 00:43:38,960
based on the proportions right and so if

1334
00:43:37,679 --> 00:43:41,358
you don't use the right proportion you

1335
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:43,599
can see that the one on the left is much

1336
00:43:41,358 --> 00:43:44,318
less close to being compatible than the

1337
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:45,760
one

1338
00:43:44,318 --> 00:43:49,039
on the right

1339
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:49,040
where enough water was added

1340
00:43:49,199 --> 00:43:52,719
all right so we're getting close to the

1341
00:43:50,639 --> 00:43:55,118
end here but i'm going to kind of throw

1342
00:43:52,719 --> 00:43:57,679
a bunch of extra

1343
00:43:55,119 --> 00:43:59,680
tips at you here so i want you to think

1344
00:43:57,679 --> 00:44:01,598
about you know

1345
00:43:59,679 --> 00:44:03,279
compatibility is really holistic we've

1346
00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:04,559
been going into each little aspect of it

1347
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:06,240
but actually it's really important to

1348
00:44:04,559 --> 00:44:08,880
look at things overall

1349
00:44:06,239 --> 00:44:11,519
um and there's many things to to take

1350
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:14,160
into account all at once so i have an

1351
00:44:11,519 --> 00:44:15,039
example here and it's captain

1352
00:44:14,159 --> 00:44:16,399
and

1353
00:44:15,039 --> 00:44:18,960
it's a fungicide label for fruit

1354
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:21,440
ornamentals um

1355
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:24,240
and what you can see is that the label

1356
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:26,000
warns that mixing caftan with alkaline

1357
00:44:24,239 --> 00:44:28,000
materials like spray lime and bordeaux

1358
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:29,920
mix can reduce the fungicidal activity

1359
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:31,760
of the product

1360
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:33,440
um and this is because the liquid lime

1361
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:35,040
sulfur has an extremely high ph so it

1362
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:36,800
can degrade captain so that's the first

1363
00:44:35,039 --> 00:44:38,239
thing you want to watch out for

1364
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:41,760
then the label mentions that you should

1365
00:44:38,239 --> 00:44:43,279
not apply captain close to oil sprays

1366
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:44,640
and the reason why is because the oil

1367
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:46,640
can actually make your plant cuticle

1368
00:44:44,639 --> 00:44:48,480
more permeable and this means that

1369
00:44:46,639 --> 00:44:51,118
captain could enter the plant and cause

1370
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:53,199
phytotoxicity

1371
00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:54,720
next the label states that

1372
00:44:53,199 --> 00:44:56,799
there might be problems with captain and

1373
00:44:54,719 --> 00:44:58,239
photo toxicity and those problems sorry

1374
00:44:56,800 --> 00:45:01,119
the problems with captain of better

1375
00:44:58,239 --> 00:45:02,879
toxicity can get worse after an extended

1376
00:45:01,119 --> 00:45:04,160
period of cloudy and damp weather so

1377
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:06,079
you're going to have to look out for the

1378
00:45:04,159 --> 00:45:07,358
weather and the reason why this is is

1379
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:10,400
because you know new leaves are going to

1380
00:45:07,358 --> 00:45:12,159
be growing when it's cloudy and damp

1381
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:14,079
and then those new leaves will have less

1382
00:45:12,159 --> 00:45:16,078
cuticular waxes it'll be easier for

1383
00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:18,800
captain to accidentally penetrate and

1384
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:20,240
damage the plant

1385
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:21,839
also the label will discourage the use

1386
00:45:20,239 --> 00:45:23,439
of spreaders that cause excessive

1387
00:45:21,838 --> 00:45:25,199
wetting and this is because much like

1388
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:27,200
with the oils adding adjuvants that

1389
00:45:25,199 --> 00:45:29,118
increase penetration into the plant can

1390
00:45:27,199 --> 00:45:30,480
cause damage to your plant vital

1391
00:45:29,119 --> 00:45:32,079
toxicity

1392
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:34,559
and then finally the label talks about

1393
00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:36,480
organophosphates and sulfur

1394
00:45:34,559 --> 00:45:38,318
um for example flint which contains

1395
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:39,760
phosphate in its formulation when it's

1396
00:45:38,318 --> 00:45:42,159
sprayed around the same time as captain

1397
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:44,319
it can result in phytotoxicity so this

1398
00:45:42,159 --> 00:45:45,759
just shows how many things you have to

1399
00:45:44,318 --> 00:45:48,318
keep in mind when you're trying to avoid

1400
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:50,800
incompatibility

1401
00:45:48,318 --> 00:45:52,400
and like with many things that are this

1402
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:54,240
complicated there's always additional

1403
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:56,559
rules of thumb so i talked to some

1404
00:45:54,239 --> 00:45:58,799
cornell extension cooperative extension

1405
00:45:56,559 --> 00:46:01,358
educators and scientists and i just want

1406
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:05,200
to share the following tips with you

1407
00:46:01,358 --> 00:46:05,199
and um steve how are we doing on time

1408
00:46:05,838 --> 00:46:08,639
we've got uh we've got another 10

1409
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:10,480
minutes or so

1410
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:12,239
okay great yeah so i might go a little

1411
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:14,960
bit over the 50 minutes but we'll still

1412
00:46:12,239 --> 00:46:16,078
have time for questions okay so um here

1413
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:17,760
are some of the additional rules of

1414
00:46:16,079 --> 00:46:19,760
thumb and i wanted to share this with

1415
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:21,119
you because you know i was talking to

1416
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:23,599
people that work with fruit and veg

1417
00:46:21,119 --> 00:46:25,519
growers so i think this is really

1418
00:46:23,599 --> 00:46:26,960
helpful to keep in mind

1419
00:46:25,519 --> 00:46:28,119
so the first thing i want to talk about

1420
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:30,159
is you want to keep in mind that

1421
00:46:28,119 --> 00:46:32,960
phytotoxicity can be specific to

1422
00:46:30,159 --> 00:46:33,838
specific crops and cultivars okay

1423
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:35,760
so

1424
00:46:33,838 --> 00:46:38,000
read the labels really carefully and

1425
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:42,079
don't assume that things will be true

1426
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:44,318
across all cultivars for example apogee

1427
00:46:42,079 --> 00:46:46,640
this is a product that can cause

1428
00:46:44,318 --> 00:46:50,159
fruit cracking on empire and stamen

1429
00:46:46,639 --> 00:46:52,239
apples but it's safe on other cultivars

1430
00:46:50,159 --> 00:46:53,920
okay and even if you aren't tank mixing

1431
00:46:52,239 --> 00:46:55,519
you want to be careful

1432
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:56,639
with tank

1433
00:46:55,519 --> 00:46:59,920
residues

1434
00:46:56,639 --> 00:47:02,239
so for example as oxy strobin

1435
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:04,639
will cause leaf and fruit burn on some

1436
00:47:02,239 --> 00:47:06,559
apple cultivars even if it's just in the

1437
00:47:04,639 --> 00:47:08,799
slightest amount like in parts per

1438
00:47:06,559 --> 00:47:10,239
billion okay so this could be a

1439
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:11,599
situation where you don't clean out your

1440
00:47:10,239 --> 00:47:13,439
tank as well as

1441
00:47:11,599 --> 00:47:15,519
you know you hope to after spraying

1442
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:17,200
exoxy and pumpkins or something right

1443
00:47:15,519 --> 00:47:18,960
then you later spray an apple and

1444
00:47:17,199 --> 00:47:21,118
there's only a tiny bit of that esoxy

1445
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:22,318
strogan but it can damage

1446
00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:24,480
um

1447
00:47:22,318 --> 00:47:25,838
the apples

1448
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:27,760
you also want to make sure your

1449
00:47:25,838 --> 00:47:29,599
ingredients are fresh

1450
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:32,079
so for example if you're an apple grower

1451
00:47:29,599 --> 00:47:33,838
you might know that lime absorbs carbon

1452
00:47:32,079 --> 00:47:35,680
dioxide and the reason why apple growers

1453
00:47:33,838 --> 00:47:38,000
might know this is because paper bags of

1454
00:47:35,679 --> 00:47:40,639
lime were actually traditionally placed

1455
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:42,318
in controlled atmosphere apple storage

1456
00:47:40,639 --> 00:47:44,239
and the reason why is because they

1457
00:47:42,318 --> 00:47:46,239
absorb carbon dioxide and this reduced

1458
00:47:44,239 --> 00:47:48,479
injury to stored apples

1459
00:47:46,239 --> 00:47:50,799
but now think about other uses you might

1460
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:52,800
have for lime if you make bordeaux mix

1461
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:54,079
with spray lime and copper sulfate

1462
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:56,000
imagine what might happen if you're

1463
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:58,240
using some of the older spray line that

1464
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:00,480
you were storing in paper bags if you

1465
00:47:58,239 --> 00:48:03,358
didn't seal that spray lime up it

1466
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:05,358
probably absorbs some carbon dioxide and

1467
00:48:03,358 --> 00:48:08,318
so just like with the glyphosate in the

1468
00:48:05,358 --> 00:48:11,358
hard water example that i showed um

1469
00:48:08,318 --> 00:48:13,920
you know it will have bound to

1470
00:48:11,358 --> 00:48:16,159
the carbon dioxide and that lime will no

1471
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:17,039
longer combine with the copper sulfate

1472
00:48:16,159 --> 00:48:18,558
because it's just not going to be

1473
00:48:17,039 --> 00:48:20,880
available and so the copper is going to

1474
00:48:18,559 --> 00:48:22,160
be less effective

1475
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:24,000
so keep in mind how fresh your

1476
00:48:22,159 --> 00:48:25,279
ingredients are

1477
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:27,039
and then i also want to talk about name

1478
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:28,800
brand versus generic i'm going to be

1479
00:48:27,039 --> 00:48:30,800
really careful here and say this is just

1480
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:32,880
anecdotal evidence okay there's not you

1481
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:34,960
know proven studies on this or anything

1482
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:36,318
but from people who have worked closely

1483
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:38,639
with apple and vegetable growers what

1484
00:48:36,318 --> 00:48:41,358
i'm hearing is that there's reports of

1485
00:48:38,639 --> 00:48:43,358
mixing issues and also crop damage with

1486
00:48:41,358 --> 00:48:45,838
some of your cheaper or off brand

1487
00:48:43,358 --> 00:48:47,598
formulations and so the reason why is

1488
00:48:45,838 --> 00:48:49,838
because cheaper formulations can have

1489
00:48:47,599 --> 00:48:52,160
varying amounts of surfactant

1490
00:48:49,838 --> 00:48:53,759
or varying quality of the inert

1491
00:48:52,159 --> 00:48:55,039
ingredients

1492
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:56,880
okay so even though the active

1493
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:57,838
ingredient is the same between the two

1494
00:48:56,880 --> 00:49:01,519
different

1495
00:48:57,838 --> 00:49:02,799
products the one that's off-brand

1496
00:49:01,519 --> 00:49:04,239
you know you might have to add more

1497
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:05,760
surfactant

1498
00:49:04,239 --> 00:49:09,118
or uh

1499
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:10,720
there's just less quality so for example

1500
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:12,880
um

1501
00:49:10,719 --> 00:49:14,639
with glyphosate for instance some of

1502
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:16,240
those off-brand products that have legs

1503
00:49:14,639 --> 00:49:18,078
as the active ingredient might require

1504
00:49:16,239 --> 00:49:20,159
more surfactants and that can increase

1505
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:21,440
the chances of like say uptake of an

1506
00:49:20,159 --> 00:49:23,519
injury to

1507
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:25,519
tree bark

1508
00:49:23,519 --> 00:49:27,039
and then also you know

1509
00:49:25,519 --> 00:49:29,358
if you have different quality of your

1510
00:49:27,039 --> 00:49:30,880
inert ingredients

1511
00:49:29,358 --> 00:49:32,558
we're seeing some generic formulations

1512
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:34,720
that sometimes don't mix as well with

1513
00:49:32,559 --> 00:49:38,079
the name brands for

1514
00:49:34,719 --> 00:49:39,279
instance bravo weather stick

1515
00:49:38,079 --> 00:49:42,400
and that's probably because those inner

1516
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:44,400
ingredients just not being as quality

1517
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:45,838
and then finally be careful

1518
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:48,240
uh which products you mix with

1519
00:49:45,838 --> 00:49:50,400
biological products okay

1520
00:49:48,239 --> 00:49:52,479
because products like fungicides

1521
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:54,800
sanitizers or bacteria size can kill

1522
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:56,800
those biologically active ingredients

1523
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:58,000
and if they're dead they're definitely

1524
00:49:56,800 --> 00:50:00,240
not going to be effective against your

1525
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,239
past

1526
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:05,599
so we talked a lot about how to prevent

1527
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:07,599
incompatibility before you even

1528
00:50:05,599 --> 00:50:09,200
you know have the problem

1529
00:50:07,599 --> 00:50:10,960
that's your first line of defense but

1530
00:50:09,199 --> 00:50:13,279
what if you do run into unexpected

1531
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:14,000
incompatibility in your tank what do you

1532
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:15,519
do

1533
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,960
when you first notice it you're going to

1534
00:50:15,519 --> 00:50:19,679
contact your dealer or product

1535
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:22,000
manufacturer to talk about options

1536
00:50:19,679 --> 00:50:23,679
worst case scenario they can tell you

1537
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:25,760
how to dispose of the solution in a way

1538
00:50:23,679 --> 00:50:27,279
that you know causes the least risk to

1539
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:29,599
you and poses the least risk to the

1540
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:31,280
environment and your equipment

1541
00:50:29,599 --> 00:50:32,960
they also might direct you to add a

1542
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:35,599
conditioner or an adjuvant that could

1543
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:37,199
improve the situation

1544
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:39,359
these could be things like more water a

1545
00:50:37,199 --> 00:50:43,598
compatibility agent a detergent soap

1546
00:50:39,358 --> 00:50:46,000
non-ionic surfactant or a ph adjuster

1547
00:50:43,599 --> 00:50:48,640
and even if that added product resolves

1548
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:50,639
the incompatibility it doesn't mean that

1549
00:50:48,639 --> 00:50:52,000
your product will be effective anymore

1550
00:50:50,639 --> 00:50:53,759
right so you'll want to check with the

1551
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:55,599
dlr manufacturer to know if your product

1552
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:58,079
will still work or if if you just

1553
00:50:55,599 --> 00:51:01,200
resolve it in compatibility enough to

1554
00:50:58,079 --> 00:51:01,200
not damage your equipment

1555
00:51:01,679 --> 00:51:07,838
and then you also want to check is the

1556
00:51:04,239 --> 00:51:09,358
problem isolated to your spray tank

1557
00:51:07,838 --> 00:51:11,358
if not

1558
00:51:09,358 --> 00:51:14,558
you may need to dismantle your sprayer

1559
00:51:11,358 --> 00:51:14,558
to remove any residues

1560
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:22,639
so i think that that's all that i have

1561
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:25,039
and i am ready to take questions

1562
00:51:22,639 --> 00:51:27,358
uh mary i will just say to you thank you

1563
00:51:25,039 --> 00:51:30,239
so much for making

1564
00:51:27,358 --> 00:51:32,318
a very complicated subject i think uh

1565
00:51:30,239 --> 00:51:33,679
rather easy to follow

1566
00:51:32,318 --> 00:51:35,519
and uh

1567
00:51:33,679 --> 00:51:37,679
i hope people feel that way i hope i

1568
00:51:35,519 --> 00:51:40,318
didn't bore you all to tears

1569
00:51:37,679 --> 00:51:42,078
no it's such an important subject too so

1570
00:51:40,318 --> 00:51:44,318
i thought it was really fascinating too

1571
00:51:42,079 --> 00:51:45,280
in terms of like the order to put things

1572
00:51:44,318 --> 00:51:47,679
in

1573
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:50,839
um and how to do that so again thank you

1574
00:51:47,679 --> 00:51:50,838
for that

1575
00:51:55,039 --> 00:52:02,679
this has been a production of cornell

1576
00:51:57,440 --> 00:52:02,679
university on the web at cornell.edu
