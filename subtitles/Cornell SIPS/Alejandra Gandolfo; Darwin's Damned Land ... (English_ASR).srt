1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,339
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:04,339
University

3
00:00:07,349 --> 00:00:13,179
thank you so much for having me be seen

4
00:00:10,179 --> 00:00:16,329
in 25 years it's the first time that I

5
00:00:13,179 --> 00:00:18,489
give a formal talk here in front of my

6
00:00:16,329 --> 00:00:21,118
my colleagues and my peers so thank you

7
00:00:18,489 --> 00:00:25,899
so much for having me doing this today

8
00:00:21,118 --> 00:00:27,490
so basically what I will show you is the

9
00:00:25,899 --> 00:00:30,868
work that I have been done for the last

10
00:00:27,489 --> 00:00:34,390
15 or 20 years actually I started this

11
00:00:30,868 --> 00:00:37,030
work when I was an undergrad student and

12
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:39,370
I got a masters studying fossils from

13
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:42,280
Patagonia then I have elapsed when I

14
00:00:39,369 --> 00:00:44,409
came here as a postdoc and then when it

15
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:46,840
was time for me to establish my own

16
00:00:44,409 --> 00:00:50,379
research program I went back to

17
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:52,210
Argentina something that is really

18
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:56,640
important for me is collaboration and

19
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:59,500
this is part of my team I have my

20
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:02,350
colleagues from Argentina colleagues

21
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:04,149
from here least was a student here at

22
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:07,539
Cornell University now she is my

23
00:01:04,149 --> 00:01:11,200
collaborator she is in Ohio my colleague

24
00:01:07,539 --> 00:01:15,879
Peter will he works the infants in Penn

25
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:17,950
State and of course my group of people

26
00:01:15,879 --> 00:01:20,618
that helped me when we are in the field

27
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:22,259
so this project is basically a

28
00:01:20,618 --> 00:01:25,000
collaboration with several institutions

29
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:30,129
not just from Cornell and the United

30
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:31,750
States but also from Argentina so one of

31
00:01:30,129 --> 00:01:34,868
the things that is important to

32
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:37,750
understand is a wire fossils important

33
00:01:34,868 --> 00:01:39,789
and one of the things that we need to

34
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:43,989
concentrate is actually in the global

35
00:01:39,789 --> 00:01:46,239
diversity throughout the world something

36
00:01:43,989 --> 00:01:48,640
that most people don't know is that the

37
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:51,549
northern hemisphere is characterized for

38
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:55,659
being continental what means that that

39
00:01:51,549 --> 00:02:00,239
means that 30% of land is in the

40
00:01:55,659 --> 00:02:03,459
northern hemisphere 70% is worth

41
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:08,050
something hemisphere is characterized to

42
00:02:03,459 --> 00:02:11,140
be in oceanic that is because only 6% of

43
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:13,959
land masses is what is formed the south

44
00:02:11,139 --> 00:02:16,268
and hemisphere and if you consider the

45
00:02:13,959 --> 00:02:18,158
part of land that is between the two

46
00:02:16,269 --> 00:02:20,620
tropics the northern hemisphere is

47
00:02:18,158 --> 00:02:24,340
represented one one two one

48
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:28,120
land and water and the South became is

49
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:32,229
ferries 1 to 16 so only one part of land

50
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:34,509
record 16% of water something that is

51
00:02:32,229 --> 00:02:37,689
interesting about this is the fact that

52
00:02:34,509 --> 00:02:40,810
of the season considered to be six

53
00:02:37,689 --> 00:02:44,109
hotspot for diversity fall into the

54
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:47,079
south and hemisphere and this is

55
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:49,989
actually indicating that definitely

56
00:02:47,079 --> 00:02:56,230
there's an asymmetry in the diversity of

57
00:02:49,989 --> 00:02:59,590
plants and biomes in general this

58
00:02:56,229 --> 00:03:02,378
latitudinal diversity it's not new is

59
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:06,219
not just in the modern times we know

60
00:03:02,378 --> 00:03:09,939
that equatorial peaks in species

61
00:03:06,219 --> 00:03:12,009
richness are typical not only for plants

62
00:03:09,939 --> 00:03:14,769
they are also for terrestrial and marine

63
00:03:12,009 --> 00:03:16,509
animals as well we know that has

64
00:03:14,769 --> 00:03:18,579
increased a moderately through the

65
00:03:16,509 --> 00:03:20,439
Cretaceous to the Cenozoic and that is

66
00:03:18,579 --> 00:03:23,590
because we have the great appear

67
00:03:20,439 --> 00:03:27,250
appearance of the vascular plants and

68
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:30,519
the unjust ferns and gymnosperm stir and

69
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:33,370
that we have buyers too late sinusoid to

70
00:03:30,519 --> 00:03:36,159
Neogene vicariance events that

71
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:38,709
effectively partitioned the tropics in

72
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:40,539
centers of high diversity so we see

73
00:03:38,709 --> 00:03:43,209
these Peaks since they Ordovician

74
00:03:40,539 --> 00:03:45,608
they're coming up and they pick actually

75
00:03:43,209 --> 00:03:48,639
with the appearance of the flowering

76
00:03:45,609 --> 00:03:52,260
plants during some place here in the

77
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:55,090
Cretaceous around 140 million years ago

78
00:03:52,259 --> 00:03:57,239
so what happened with the Americas this

79
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:59,680
is this talk is about patagonia so I'm

80
00:03:57,239 --> 00:04:03,609
trying to go towards there so what

81
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:06,579
happened with a America in the United

82
00:04:03,609 --> 00:04:09,730
States that has approximately 10 million

83
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:12,129
square kilometres it has 7 percent of

84
00:04:09,729 --> 00:04:14,768
the global diversity and inches per

85
00:04:12,128 --> 00:04:17,889
level and 1.4 are considered to be

86
00:04:14,769 --> 00:04:21,759
endemic however if we look at Brazil

87
00:04:17,889 --> 00:04:24,879
that is smaller than the United States

88
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:28,418
actually carries 98 20 percent of the

89
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:29,339
global diversity of those 66 percent an

90
00:04:28,418 --> 00:04:31,259
endemic

91
00:04:29,339 --> 00:04:36,060
and we know that it's a fact that around

92
00:04:31,259 --> 00:04:38,519
40% of the of the Amazon basic has never

93
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:40,769
been sampled therefore we expect to have

94
00:04:38,519 --> 00:04:43,680
much more in them explains there than we

95
00:04:40,769 --> 00:04:45,948
know up today and what happened with

96
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:50,639
Argentina where Patagonia is located

97
00:04:45,949 --> 00:04:52,740
Argentina is actually almost one-third

98
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:55,620
of the size of United States

99
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:59,759
it only has 3% of the global angiosperm

100
00:04:55,620 --> 00:05:01,978
diversity and has 0.5% of endemics but

101
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:03,870
if you consider this half of the size is

102
00:05:01,978 --> 00:05:09,719
approximately has the same number of

103
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:14,819
endemic stabbed the United States so we

104
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:19,169
observe this diversity asymmetry also if

105
00:05:14,819 --> 00:05:22,288
we look at the Americas in general so

106
00:05:19,168 --> 00:05:24,839
coming from South America it's important

107
00:05:22,288 --> 00:05:26,038
for me to explain what South America is

108
00:05:24,839 --> 00:05:29,129
about

109
00:05:26,038 --> 00:05:32,899
more or less we have 90 thousand

110
00:05:29,129 --> 00:05:37,110
vascular plants species of which in

111
00:05:32,899 --> 00:05:40,138
Antarctica only has two of them but

112
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:44,009
South America and Antarctica are really

113
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:46,889
critical are extremely critical to

114
00:05:44,009 --> 00:05:50,189
understand and comprehend several

115
00:05:46,889 --> 00:05:52,199
factors about plants first explain the

116
00:05:50,189 --> 00:05:54,360
direction and flow of the dispersion

117
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:57,629
emmigration roots of all these plants

118
00:05:54,360 --> 00:06:00,598
and also animals explain the radiation

119
00:05:57,629 --> 00:06:04,379
and dominance of the ancestors in the

120
00:06:00,598 --> 00:06:07,469
south and hemisphere in general and also

121
00:06:04,379 --> 00:06:10,079
helps to interpret the distant model of

122
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:12,660
the modern astral distribution and this

123
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:17,189
is because South America was part of

124
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:20,789
their big continent called Gondwana so

125
00:06:17,189 --> 00:06:23,728
just to show you Antarctica is during

126
00:06:20,788 --> 00:06:27,538
the summer it has only two percent free

127
00:06:23,728 --> 00:06:30,449
of snow is the coldest windiest and

128
00:06:27,538 --> 00:06:33,500
driest desert on the planet

129
00:06:30,449 --> 00:06:36,360
and has only two particular plants

130
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:39,060
Columb Antos which is in the car yo

131
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:43,319
Philly AC and this champion which is a

132
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:47,759
grass Argentine

133
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:49,589
it's only a thousand miles exactly for

134
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:51,899
the Antarctic Peninsula so it's only

135
00:06:49,589 --> 00:06:54,709
1600 kilometers from the Antarctic

136
00:06:51,899 --> 00:06:57,299
Peninsula to the South Armagh city of

137
00:06:54,709 --> 00:07:01,649
Argentina which is suya

138
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:05,689
and actually it has high diversity has

139
00:07:01,649 --> 00:07:11,120
families are represented 215 we have

140
00:07:05,689 --> 00:07:11,120
approximately 2,000 general and around

141
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:21,930
2009 thousand species of vascular plants

142
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:22,980
and of the ups of these 1800 are

143
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:27,300
endemics

144
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:29,819
they are only found in Argentina so what

145
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:32,009
is Patagonia Patagonia is basically the

146
00:07:29,819 --> 00:07:37,139
last thousand mass of the southernmost

147
00:07:32,009 --> 00:07:42,899
tip of South America is considered to be

148
00:07:37,139 --> 00:07:46,560
largely inhabited and I the population

149
00:07:42,899 --> 00:07:48,750
is around 4 people per kilometer square

150
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:52,459
so when you go there mostly you don't

151
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:57,750
see people around if you divide

152
00:07:52,459 --> 00:08:00,629
Patagonia using the Andes you will have

153
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:04,350
two different type of environments in

154
00:08:00,629 --> 00:08:09,089
general they step or the Patagonian step

155
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:12,170
which is actually flat dry plain mostly

156
00:08:09,089 --> 00:08:16,319
are grasslands and if you look at the

157
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:18,270
border with Chile and the Andes what you

158
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:21,569
will see our mountain sites that are

159
00:08:18,269 --> 00:08:27,029
covered by rainforests that's where we

160
00:08:21,569 --> 00:08:28,860
have the numerous glaciers that extend

161
00:08:27,029 --> 00:08:35,519
on both sides on the argentinian side

162
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:38,009
and the Chile Nia side so the term

163
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:40,799
Patagonia comes from actually the first

164
00:08:38,009 --> 00:08:43,889
Spaniards that arrived there around 50

165
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:48,479
countries they saw this big Indians

166
00:08:43,889 --> 00:08:50,909
cause they will chest and it will chase

167
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:54,450
we are very tall men up to 2 meters and

168
00:08:50,909 --> 00:08:55,949
they wear look higher and taller due to

169
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:59,009
the fact that they wear

170
00:08:55,950 --> 00:09:01,710
a lot of pills from one uncle's to cover

171
00:08:59,009 --> 00:09:04,500
themselves and also because they use

172
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:07,470
those to cover their feet so what they

173
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:10,230
see the footstep that they Spanier so

174
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:13,470
we're the ones used by these out by

175
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:18,300
these natives so the name Patagonia

176
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:21,149
comes from there however Charles Darwin

177
00:09:18,299 --> 00:09:25,649
during the trip to the beat the big old

178
00:09:21,149 --> 00:09:28,379
trip with Fitzroy in commanding London

179
00:09:25,649 --> 00:09:31,649
in Patagonia he was only 24 years old

180
00:09:28,379 --> 00:09:34,590
and the first impression of Patagonia

181
00:09:31,649 --> 00:09:37,259
was exactly this is the surface in quite

182
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:41,399
level and is composed of well-rounded

183
00:09:37,259 --> 00:09:43,769
single mix with the widest earth here

184
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:46,769
and they are is character of brown wire

185
00:09:43,769 --> 00:09:49,679
with grass are supported and is still

186
00:09:46,769 --> 00:09:52,110
really some low thorny bushes and

187
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:58,309
actually it does exactly what Patagonia

188
00:09:52,110 --> 00:10:01,440
is so we have a huge this is prepare

189
00:09:58,309 --> 00:10:04,739
cabin this is one of cabinet slides and

190
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:07,230
actually it's just to show that that was

191
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:10,919
his vision is know how Patagonia is

192
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:13,889
Patagonia is extremely rich in vascular

193
00:10:10,919 --> 00:10:16,379
plants and extremely endemic so we have

194
00:10:13,889 --> 00:10:19,259
different type of biomes and just I will

195
00:10:16,379 --> 00:10:21,679
show you only a couple of them I will

196
00:10:19,259 --> 00:10:24,210
show you materials from this step and

197
00:10:21,679 --> 00:10:27,000
materials that you will see close to the

198
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:30,389
valdivian forests so if you were looking

199
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:36,120
at this step extant flora oh sorry

200
00:10:30,389 --> 00:10:38,789
if you were looking at the side of the

201
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:41,879
Andes what you will see are these

202
00:10:38,789 --> 00:10:46,939
spectacular views these are mostly big

203
00:10:41,879 --> 00:10:50,939
lakes with volcanoes covers by beautiful

204
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:53,490
forest of notify us and when - and Clube

205
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:56,640
us and also if you have the chance you

206
00:10:53,490 --> 00:11:00,230
can see the perito moreno glacier which

207
00:10:56,639 --> 00:11:03,720
is one of the most active pleasures in

208
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:06,389
modern times and these are some of the

209
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:09,589
endemics we have in between in the

210
00:11:06,389 --> 00:11:15,389
poetry in Proteus e we have notification

211
00:11:09,589 --> 00:11:19,139
looma is a mute AC which lack of bark as

212
00:11:15,389 --> 00:11:22,289
many of them UTC we have the typical RL

213
00:11:19,139 --> 00:11:27,240
Korea in the era of Korea s colonia and

214
00:11:22,289 --> 00:11:29,278
dream is in the winter AC but if you go

215
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:30,750
to the step you have the opportunity to

216
00:11:29,278 --> 00:11:36,958
see me while you are walking

217
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:42,690
penguins you can see also other kind of

218
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:45,469
wildlife such as Maureen's arms it went

219
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:48,779
out of my mind it's not important but

220
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:52,800
you can also see a different type of

221
00:11:48,778 --> 00:11:56,100
bushes and brushes and some of those are

222
00:11:52,799 --> 00:12:01,439
these for example area in the sea go

223
00:11:56,100 --> 00:12:04,470
fillet see we have beautiful legumes are

224
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:08,040
a natural freedom we have some of the

225
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:10,079
most spectacular cut tide and we have

226
00:12:08,039 --> 00:12:22,409
these are endemics we have chuckwalla

227
00:12:10,078 --> 00:12:26,068
which is one of the composite ok these

228
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:28,409
are this next to it slides our photos

229
00:12:26,068 --> 00:12:32,338
that I took meanwhile I was working from

230
00:12:28,409 --> 00:12:34,948
the truck to one of my sides so and that

231
00:12:32,339 --> 00:12:37,380
was a work of less than 1 kilometer so

232
00:12:34,948 --> 00:12:41,039
he's really very rich if you are looking

233
00:12:37,379 --> 00:12:43,620
down Patagonia has all kind of budgets

234
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:45,299
and brushes but the trick is to look on

235
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:50,818
the ground so we see things like a

236
00:12:45,299 --> 00:12:54,448
federal holiday see we seek Tripoli a

237
00:12:50,818 --> 00:12:56,849
sea like a school area Romney see in the

238
00:12:54,448 --> 00:13:02,219
colleague waha this is one of the

239
00:12:56,850 --> 00:13:08,659
endemics another cactus as Arella louis

240
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:08,660
AC another composite apiaceae

241
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:20,540
another ones like in natera

242
00:13:14,458 --> 00:13:23,578
a bunch of legumes and several monocots

243
00:13:20,539 --> 00:13:27,179
so this is charge from the work from the

244
00:13:23,578 --> 00:13:30,088
truck to one of my sites so they the

245
00:13:27,179 --> 00:13:32,159
flora is incredible and then also me

246
00:13:30,089 --> 00:13:34,649
what you are collecting you are really

247
00:13:32,159 --> 00:13:38,370
lucky on see a lot of wildlife such as

248
00:13:34,649 --> 00:13:44,850
condors when I chose penguins

249
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:47,100
Andrea's these are flightless birds so

250
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:50,040
how did Patagonia reach the high

251
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:52,290
diversity the present flora to answer

252
00:13:50,039 --> 00:13:55,379
that question definitely we need to look

253
00:13:52,289 --> 00:13:57,990
at the fossil record fossils are

254
00:13:55,379 --> 00:14:00,449
extremely important no chance to check

255
00:13:57,990 --> 00:14:02,730
for endemics or no chance to explain

256
00:14:00,448 --> 00:14:06,028
modern distribution but they actually

257
00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:08,879
provide additional information to assess

258
00:14:06,028 --> 00:14:12,299
quality and evolutionary change through

259
00:14:08,879 --> 00:14:14,639
time they also provide character

260
00:14:12,299 --> 00:14:17,159
evidence that effect our phylogenetic

261
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:19,230
conclusion so one of the things that we

262
00:14:17,159 --> 00:14:23,100
do is include all these fossils within

263
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:26,519
the phylogenetic analysis that helps us

264
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:30,209
to understand more than relationship not

265
00:14:26,519 --> 00:14:32,129
just past relationships fossils also

266
00:14:30,208 --> 00:14:34,469
help to estimate the minimal

267
00:14:32,129 --> 00:14:37,528
ages of certain clays that they are

268
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:39,720
prisoner and those definitely are the

269
00:14:37,528 --> 00:14:43,649
best source for calibration for

270
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:45,629
molecular dating finally they also help

271
00:14:43,649 --> 00:14:48,629
to understand the evidence of past

272
00:14:45,629 --> 00:14:50,970
distribution therefore they can aid us

273
00:14:48,629 --> 00:14:53,370
to understand biogeographic histories

274
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:56,160
not only from the past but also from the

275
00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:58,558
present so we have several papers in

276
00:14:56,159 --> 00:15:01,350
which we've been utilizing the

277
00:14:58,558 --> 00:15:03,899
record to answer different questions for

278
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:06,000
example we provide lists of Monaco's

279
00:15:03,899 --> 00:15:09,948
that are suitable for molecular dating

280
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:12,120
analysis we also study the Cenozoic

281
00:15:09,948 --> 00:15:16,109
biogeographical evolution of goodI

282
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:18,720
plants we are able to understand

283
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:20,818
phylogenetic biome conservatism if we

284
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:23,639
look at the fossil record comparing them

285
00:15:20,818 --> 00:15:27,569
with extra material and fine

286
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:31,949
we are able to do some testing to impact

287
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:35,730
of how we do calibration treatments

288
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:38,220
using fossils so fossils really are key

289
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:41,970
for any kind of study that you want to

290
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:44,100
do so the research questions these are

291
00:15:41,970 --> 00:15:48,990
the big research questions that we have

292
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:51,959
in in my group are basically based on

293
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:54,899
Patagonia and one of the questions we

294
00:15:51,958 --> 00:15:58,078
thought is was Patagonia a refuge from

295
00:15:54,899 --> 00:16:00,240
the M of Cretaceous maxes station and I

296
00:15:58,078 --> 00:16:03,539
will we go to that in a little bit if

297
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:06,930
you remember during the KPG boundary was

298
00:16:03,539 --> 00:16:09,750
a mass extinction many vertebrates group

299
00:16:06,929 --> 00:16:12,569
disappear many plants disappear however

300
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:14,278
the event is completely different in the

301
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:16,950
northern hemisphere than the south

302
00:16:14,278 --> 00:16:20,669
hemisphere and why is that because again

303
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:23,009
we have bad differences in the top the

304
00:16:20,669 --> 00:16:24,449
northern hemisphere being continental

305
00:16:23,009 --> 00:16:28,799
that south and chemists are being

306
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:31,740
oceanic what are the composition

307
00:16:28,799 --> 00:16:34,379
diversity and biogeography affinities of

308
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:36,419
early Paleocene Eocene flora and why is

309
00:16:34,379 --> 00:16:38,939
this important because if we have mass

310
00:16:36,419 --> 00:16:41,189
extinction at the end of the Cretaceous

311
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:44,279
we need to have something at the

312
00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:46,829
beginning of the apology so we are

313
00:16:44,278 --> 00:16:51,179
interested in Damian Flores which is the

314
00:16:46,828 --> 00:16:53,939
South the most basal part of the

315
00:16:51,179 --> 00:16:56,099
pollutant and one of the things that we

316
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:58,290
are very lucky is because we shop the

317
00:16:56,100 --> 00:17:03,300
only Danian in the south and chemists

318
00:16:58,289 --> 00:17:05,730
are represented in Patagonia so are

319
00:17:03,299 --> 00:17:08,759
these flora contain lineages that now

320
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:12,900
survive South America Asia Africa as

321
00:17:08,759 --> 00:17:15,029
well as Australasia do they document the

322
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:17,548
early phases of South America and

323
00:17:15,029 --> 00:17:20,160
isolation by showing a loss of congo

324
00:17:17,548 --> 00:17:23,578
anna taxa and increasing the new word

325
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:26,509
taxa our evolutionary processes

326
00:17:23,578 --> 00:17:29,940
processes register in the fossil record

327
00:17:26,509 --> 00:17:33,359
so this is something that we attempt to

328
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:35,370
answer not today will be impossible for

329
00:17:33,359 --> 00:17:37,908
me to answer all those questions but we

330
00:17:35,369 --> 00:17:41,729
are working towards answered them

331
00:17:37,909 --> 00:17:45,769
so the journey has stars much before we

332
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:48,720
get today today film so first we start

333
00:17:45,769 --> 00:17:51,929
collecting information and checking

334
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:53,880
geological maps here in my library then

335
00:17:51,929 --> 00:17:57,389
if we are lucky enough that United

336
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:59,399
doesn't cancel my fly from Ithaca I'm

337
00:17:57,388 --> 00:18:01,469
able to arrive to New York I'm from

338
00:17:59,398 --> 00:18:04,229
there I fly all the way to Buenos Aires

339
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:07,048
from when aside as I fly again to a

340
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:08,970
small town called parallel where my

341
00:18:07,048 --> 00:18:12,148
colleagues from the Museo paleontology

342
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:14,548
Coheed of Aurelio or myth our house and

343
00:18:12,148 --> 00:18:17,638
that's where I spend most of my time

344
00:18:14,548 --> 00:18:21,480
when I go to Argentina before leaving to

345
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:25,918
the film if you go to Toledo you have

346
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:31,490
the chance to stop in the Touring Club

347
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:34,950
this is the Touring Club and around 99

348
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:38,339
1900 species today and there is where

349
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:40,798
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid stay

350
00:18:38,339 --> 00:18:43,158
you can stay in the room it charge you a

351
00:18:40,798 --> 00:18:46,288
little extra money

352
00:18:43,159 --> 00:18:49,409
you can sit also at the table where

353
00:18:46,288 --> 00:18:52,710
George Simpson write some of his books

354
00:18:49,409 --> 00:18:56,610
he was a visitor there for several years

355
00:18:52,710 --> 00:19:00,210
in the 30s and finally you can also sat

356
00:18:56,609 --> 00:19:03,269
at a table where excites up untwine

357
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:06,360
exonic super ii wrote part of the little

358
00:19:03,269 --> 00:19:08,940
prince book so you can do all those

359
00:19:06,359 --> 00:19:15,329
things when you go to Train L class work

360
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:17,610
in the collections so what do we do we

361
00:19:15,329 --> 00:19:21,058
work at the collections first we check

362
00:19:17,609 --> 00:19:22,829
numbers we also get ready to go to the

363
00:19:21,058 --> 00:19:26,788
field so we carry everything we carry

364
00:19:22,829 --> 00:19:29,460
from the water food before leaving from

365
00:19:26,788 --> 00:19:33,599
the film we take pictures of course and

366
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:36,990
we drive and drive sometimes we get into

367
00:19:33,599 --> 00:19:38,878
situations where is dubious if you can

368
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:42,089
pass with the truck or no we were able

369
00:19:38,878 --> 00:19:45,538
to after three days if the tracks breaks

370
00:19:42,089 --> 00:19:47,668
are there's no the shop you need to come

371
00:19:45,538 --> 00:19:50,269
up to the occasion and everybody works

372
00:19:47,669 --> 00:19:52,909
to try to fix the truck

373
00:19:50,269 --> 00:19:56,239
lucky enough you come maybe arrive on

374
00:19:52,909 --> 00:19:59,330
time to set your tent which it will be

375
00:19:56,239 --> 00:20:02,598
your house for the next 15 days and then

376
00:19:59,329 --> 00:20:05,808
if the wind doesn't blow does the tent

377
00:20:02,598 --> 00:20:07,548
where you will have hopefully some

378
00:20:05,808 --> 00:20:11,618
dinners and lunches

379
00:20:07,548 --> 00:20:15,788
maybe now we never go out of the pill

380
00:20:11,618 --> 00:20:19,638
without having a dinosaur detector I

381
00:20:15,788 --> 00:20:22,398
suppose such as said by the people in

382
00:20:19,638 --> 00:20:26,028
Jurassic Park and actually we keep an

383
00:20:22,398 --> 00:20:29,628
eye open if we see bones we were very

384
00:20:26,028 --> 00:20:32,028
lucky to find not too long ago bones of

385
00:20:29,628 --> 00:20:37,118
the loved one of the largest dinosaurs

386
00:20:32,028 --> 00:20:39,409
in in Patagonia and on the earth so

387
00:20:37,118 --> 00:20:42,078
concentration we are working in many

388
00:20:39,409 --> 00:20:44,629
different Paolo Flores I will just

389
00:20:42,078 --> 00:20:46,969
mention three of them today because

390
00:20:44,628 --> 00:20:49,038
these are the most spectacular ones I

391
00:20:46,969 --> 00:20:51,889
will be talking about La Colonia

392
00:20:49,038 --> 00:20:54,739
formation which is that one that is in

393
00:20:51,888 --> 00:20:57,108
the KPG boundary is the most companion

394
00:20:54,739 --> 00:21:00,528
to Maastricht and in h de salamanca

395
00:20:57,108 --> 00:21:03,378
formation which is dannion that puts us

396
00:21:00,528 --> 00:21:06,618
in the early Paleocene around 65 million

397
00:21:03,378 --> 00:21:08,628
years ago and then the tufa leta Laguna

398
00:21:06,618 --> 00:21:13,308
del junco which is basically a tough

399
00:21:08,628 --> 00:21:15,828
they were just stuff is just ashes and

400
00:21:13,308 --> 00:21:19,009
ashes and ashes it the two Politis

401
00:21:15,828 --> 00:21:21,348
Laguna alum Co is compared today what

402
00:21:19,009 --> 00:21:24,229
you have in Yellowstone is considered to

403
00:21:21,348 --> 00:21:28,158
be one of the largest mega calderas for

404
00:21:24,229 --> 00:21:31,399
theyíre seeing worldwide and that I the

405
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:33,679
age of that to Paula died is I present

406
00:21:31,398 --> 00:21:36,168
which is an early policy so basically

407
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:39,169
what we are looking is from La Colonia

408
00:21:36,169 --> 00:21:41,959
to the Salamanca to the to Politis

409
00:21:39,169 --> 00:21:47,269
Laguna Lucca and here is where you will

410
00:21:41,959 --> 00:21:49,879
have the KPG boundary this is just I

411
00:21:47,269 --> 00:21:52,219
don't want to over menu with geology but

412
00:21:49,878 --> 00:21:55,009
this is just to show you how the south

413
00:21:52,219 --> 00:21:57,259
and chemistry look in polar view during

414
00:21:55,009 --> 00:22:01,009
a specific time so these seas around

415
00:21:57,259 --> 00:22:02,929
amassed ricktum and as you can see we

416
00:22:01,009 --> 00:22:04,069
have it still little con wanna start to

417
00:22:02,929 --> 00:22:08,269
break at around the track

418
00:22:04,069 --> 00:22:11,569
but major movements started from the

419
00:22:08,269 --> 00:22:14,839
Triassic all the way to modern times so

420
00:22:11,569 --> 00:22:16,879
here is the reconstruction for the

421
00:22:14,839 --> 00:22:21,259
maastricht Ian this is a brief

422
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:23,690
reconstruction for the dannion one for

423
00:22:21,259 --> 00:22:25,640
the using which is depression and

424
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:27,320
finally disease today is the

425
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:29,840
reconstruction one of the things that I

426
00:22:27,319 --> 00:22:32,179
want to point it out here is about this

427
00:22:29,839 --> 00:22:35,359
point this point and this points we

428
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:38,150
didn't have the circumpolar current

429
00:22:35,359 --> 00:22:41,509
so the temperature at that point was is

430
00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:43,610
still high so when we hear their ears in

431
00:22:41,509 --> 00:22:47,359
what we are hearing is the maximum

432
00:22:43,609 --> 00:22:50,119
thermal during the tertiary and that is

433
00:22:47,359 --> 00:22:52,819
important because is when we start to

434
00:22:50,119 --> 00:22:58,339
change different type of taxa and we

435
00:22:52,819 --> 00:23:02,149
will see that in a minute once we are in

436
00:22:58,339 --> 00:23:04,490
the field we continue driving we drop

437
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:06,490
the cars there and then we walk to the

438
00:23:04,490 --> 00:23:10,250
sediments where we will be collecting

439
00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:12,890
it's not easy it's not vacation time

440
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:17,630
like most people think we carry heavy

441
00:23:12,890 --> 00:23:19,790
machinery to break the rocks in this

442
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:25,070
case you can see here we have a rotary

443
00:23:19,789 --> 00:23:26,960
so once we have what is called a quarry

444
00:23:25,069 --> 00:23:30,549
which is the place where we work at

445
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:33,319
where fossils we do a lot of on hand

446
00:23:30,549 --> 00:23:37,460
activities chests are using the pick and

447
00:23:33,319 --> 00:23:40,579
shovels and cleaning the quarry we

448
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:44,299
obtain rocks and we pick the rocks we

449
00:23:40,579 --> 00:23:46,909
divide the rocks we clean the fossils we

450
00:23:44,299 --> 00:23:49,940
select the fossils in the field we pack

451
00:23:46,910 --> 00:23:53,330
them and finally we live a clean quarry

452
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:56,830
for the following day having a clean

453
00:23:53,329 --> 00:24:00,559
quarry helps you to do paleoecological

454
00:23:56,829 --> 00:24:03,619
studies we take every single fossil that

455
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:07,309
every single fossil that we excavate is

456
00:24:03,619 --> 00:24:10,399
recorded that allow us to do fish anomic

457
00:24:07,309 --> 00:24:12,980
analysis which basically allow us to

458
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:15,500
calculate maximum temperatures and also

459
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:17,500
based on those characters we also are

460
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:21,910
able to produce

461
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:26,200
small temperature and a ring so these

462
00:24:21,910 --> 00:24:29,500
studies are really important so what are

463
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:32,230
the Middle's that we use obviously on

464
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:34,900
the fossils are collected we take it to

465
00:24:32,230 --> 00:24:37,390
their collections and they are the

466
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:39,759
Apostles are prepared we use standard

467
00:24:37,390 --> 00:24:41,860
methods depends on the fossils we do it

468
00:24:39,759 --> 00:24:44,769
by hand sometimes we have a little tools

469
00:24:41,859 --> 00:24:47,549
that help us to do that you will see

470
00:24:44,769 --> 00:24:50,829
later on sometimes we are able to obtain

471
00:24:47,549 --> 00:24:58,029
pollen grains in situ so that those are

472
00:24:50,829 --> 00:25:02,230
a study with TEM and SEM as well and we

473
00:24:58,029 --> 00:25:05,379
are try to include all our photos within

474
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:08,349
a phylogenetic context so basically what

475
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:11,290
we do is at oral evidence approach for

476
00:25:08,349 --> 00:25:13,539
this we use matrices that have already

477
00:25:11,289 --> 00:25:16,180
provided I've had already published if

478
00:25:13,539 --> 00:25:19,240
they are not we produce our own a

479
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:21,580
morphological matrices we combine those

480
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:23,859
with molecular data that we obtain from

481
00:25:21,579 --> 00:25:25,689
gene Bank and other sources and

482
00:25:23,859 --> 00:25:28,779
sometimes you will find that we need

483
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:31,990
some key taxa that needs to be explored

484
00:25:28,779 --> 00:25:36,099
for the relationship we even do our own

485
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:40,359
instruction of DNA and these are just

486
00:25:36,099 --> 00:25:43,689
some of the things that we use we use

487
00:25:40,359 --> 00:25:47,169
maximum persimmony and we use use a

488
00:25:43,690 --> 00:25:49,930
maximum likelihood on all our projects

489
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:53,230
sometimes fossils can not be included

490
00:25:49,930 --> 00:25:55,269
and we don't so the methodology that we

491
00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:58,360
use is basically to go to our buyer

492
00:25:55,269 --> 00:26:00,879
sheet compare what do we have there and

493
00:25:58,359 --> 00:26:03,429
try to figure it out where we can place

494
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:06,700
these fossils in what families so we do

495
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:10,900
a lot of modern and modern taxonomy or

496
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:13,090
systematics of these groups so now

497
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:13,780
colonial formation our crops in the

498
00:26:13,089 --> 00:26:16,599
Samoa

499
00:26:13,779 --> 00:26:18,670
massive is considered to be upper

500
00:26:16,599 --> 00:26:21,009
cretaceous and one of the things that is

501
00:26:18,670 --> 00:26:23,830
important is for all the deformations

502
00:26:21,009 --> 00:26:27,190
that we present today we have a very

503
00:26:23,829 --> 00:26:30,250
good detriment eh so the age in this

504
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:30,740
case is 65 to 83 if based on many

505
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:33,940
current

506
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:38,240
geographic markers so we know that the

507
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:41,090
formation is 72 million years old it has

508
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:42,740
three different fascias which means

509
00:26:41,089 --> 00:26:45,558
three different type of environments

510
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:48,019
where the forces were a deposit and what

511
00:26:45,558 --> 00:26:50,119
is important here is that all our

512
00:26:48,019 --> 00:26:53,058
fossils come from the lower and middle

513
00:26:50,119 --> 00:26:56,539
phases which are represented by coastal

514
00:26:53,058 --> 00:27:00,170
freshwater lakes or fresh water lagoons

515
00:26:56,539 --> 00:27:02,629
and I will not show you all the fossils

516
00:27:00,170 --> 00:27:07,370
today but I want to make sure that is

517
00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:10,059
one the fossils that we have found there

518
00:27:07,369 --> 00:27:13,428
are represented by the family salvini AC

519
00:27:10,058 --> 00:27:14,539
which is a equity fern Dixon II AC

520
00:27:13,429 --> 00:27:17,240
source of ferns

521
00:27:14,539 --> 00:27:19,009
we have several conifers but the most

522
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:23,558
prominent one are from the familiar

523
00:27:19,009 --> 00:27:26,690
Akari I see we have the first and oldest

524
00:27:23,558 --> 00:27:31,160
record of Nagumo Lacy which is an

525
00:27:26,690 --> 00:27:34,429
aquatic plant we have pumps the family

526
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:36,590
Eric AC and we have T faci also is

527
00:27:34,429 --> 00:27:37,340
considered to be an offshore kind of

528
00:27:36,589 --> 00:27:39,319
plant

529
00:27:37,339 --> 00:27:41,480
we have several dicots and monocots

530
00:27:39,319 --> 00:27:43,819
leave from Morpho types we are working

531
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:46,460
on that but also we have an extremely

532
00:27:43,819 --> 00:27:50,960
rich Paulino flora which is basically

533
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:53,690
pollen grains and spores so I will show

534
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:56,150
you just a couple of examples and I'm

535
00:27:53,690 --> 00:27:58,850
very proud of their solar because this

536
00:27:56,150 --> 00:28:00,980
is the oldest record worldwide of a cold

537
00:27:58,849 --> 00:28:04,279
plant that means we have the sporophyte

538
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:06,470
and we have these four Oh cups and those

539
00:28:04,279 --> 00:28:09,079
inside the sporocarp sir this is the

540
00:28:06,470 --> 00:28:13,490
plant this is one of the poorer cups we

541
00:28:09,079 --> 00:28:19,009
were able to pull out the Mayla spores

542
00:28:13,490 --> 00:28:21,890
and each megaspore has stick to it the

543
00:28:19,009 --> 00:28:23,750
microspores and those micro spores are

544
00:28:21,890 --> 00:28:26,900
represented by these little things here

545
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:29,359
and this is a specific type of extension

546
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:31,820
of the wall called a clock idea

547
00:28:29,359 --> 00:28:35,149
the glochidia are fundamental for the

548
00:28:31,819 --> 00:28:40,990
micro sport to reach the floaters of the

549
00:28:35,150 --> 00:28:40,990
megaspores and then copulate

550
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:48,080
marci liaison is also an aquatic firm

551
00:28:45,319 --> 00:28:53,059
they are it's a very small family with

552
00:28:48,079 --> 00:28:56,179
three genera and we have here this is

553
00:28:53,059 --> 00:28:58,579
represented a very close to the genus

554
00:28:56,180 --> 00:29:00,950
Martin Maher cilia which has four

555
00:28:58,579 --> 00:29:03,819
leaflets we have the four leaflets here

556
00:29:00,950 --> 00:29:07,220
and in this case we also find the

557
00:29:03,819 --> 00:29:11,059
sporocarp and regnal idiom which is only

558
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:14,360
is endemic of a small area in Brazil

559
00:29:11,059 --> 00:29:16,399
away and Argentina has a rich fossil

560
00:29:14,359 --> 00:29:19,219
record in the northern hemisphere not in

561
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:22,519
the South ek mister however we found

562
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:26,870
that in log whoops we founded in La

563
00:29:22,519 --> 00:29:31,539
Colonia with the two leaflets and this

564
00:29:26,869 --> 00:29:35,149
is flora carbs yield the mega spores

565
00:29:31,539 --> 00:29:37,399
which has called more last fora when you

566
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:39,860
find it that is not associated and

567
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:46,850
chrisphillip or it is which are these

568
00:29:39,859 --> 00:29:49,009
ones here so these are the oldest

569
00:29:46,849 --> 00:29:52,399
records for the family Marci Lee I see

570
00:29:49,009 --> 00:29:54,129
worldwide the Salamanca formation

571
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:56,870
belongs to a completely different

572
00:29:54,130 --> 00:30:00,080
formation and basin is the son jorge

573
00:29:56,869 --> 00:30:03,009
basin we know that is Dan Ian is really

574
00:30:00,079 --> 00:30:06,949
well established the age is the only

575
00:30:03,009 --> 00:30:09,349
South and hemisphere Danian sediments is

576
00:30:06,950 --> 00:30:11,269
represented by Australian deposits and

577
00:30:09,349 --> 00:30:14,409
one of the things that we know is that

578
00:30:11,269 --> 00:30:17,750
has one of the most fantastic

579
00:30:14,410 --> 00:30:20,420
invertebrate flora M in vertebrae

580
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:25,190
furnace and among them is one of the

581
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:28,310
breaches for insects it also has a rich

582
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:31,309
Bellino flora but the mega flora is

583
00:30:28,309 --> 00:30:35,389
almost unknown and that is because we

584
00:30:31,309 --> 00:30:37,129
have a lot of and just firm or four

585
00:30:35,390 --> 00:30:39,500
times does are the ones that we don't

586
00:30:37,130 --> 00:30:41,540
know where to put them

587
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:44,650
the formation was discovered many many

588
00:30:41,539 --> 00:30:49,190
years ago but it still we started

589
00:30:44,650 --> 00:30:52,129
something around it 2007

590
00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:58,159
and that's where we go they always

591
00:30:52,128 --> 00:31:01,728
record for the re Casey represented by

592
00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:05,659
the ethylene II subscribe

593
00:31:01,729 --> 00:31:07,639
these are their seats the Charlotte I'm

594
00:31:05,659 --> 00:31:10,039
sorry those are actually the fruits you

595
00:31:07,638 --> 00:31:13,428
can see here they have the three bulbs

596
00:31:10,038 --> 00:31:17,808
they have only two pores and these are

597
00:31:13,429 --> 00:31:22,479
the seeds we extend distribution of the

598
00:31:17,808 --> 00:31:27,200
a tahini is this area northern part of

599
00:31:22,479 --> 00:31:30,200
Argentina and again we did a

600
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:35,778
phylogenetic analysis and is place

601
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:39,819
within this trade of the ethylene e we

602
00:31:35,778 --> 00:31:43,579
also this is work with my with Nathan my

603
00:31:39,819 --> 00:31:46,278
actual my postdoc at this time so here

604
00:31:43,579 --> 00:31:47,720
we have the oldest record from Nasik

605
00:31:46,278 --> 00:31:50,868
were y as well

606
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:53,329
it's a flower and is characterized abide

607
00:31:50,868 --> 00:31:56,058
as being pentamerous they have a very

608
00:31:53,329 --> 00:31:57,978
distinctive type of colleagues they have

609
00:31:56,058 --> 00:32:03,168
the clock cookie laid a margin eight

610
00:31:57,979 --> 00:32:05,389
petals petals and the family is today

611
00:32:03,169 --> 00:32:08,570
work well distributed but the fossil

612
00:32:05,388 --> 00:32:11,148
record is not very abundant again we

613
00:32:08,569 --> 00:32:14,418
included a phylogenetic context and it

614
00:32:11,148 --> 00:32:18,798
fits within the CC points which are

615
00:32:14,419 --> 00:32:22,009
found today in there in the Americas we

616
00:32:18,798 --> 00:32:25,190
have also found Koonin EAC which is a

617
00:32:22,009 --> 00:32:27,739
typical South and Hemisphere family in

618
00:32:25,190 --> 00:32:30,590
Argentina we have only four genera clock

619
00:32:27,739 --> 00:32:35,598
rubia okra Elliman Anya and when Manya

620
00:32:30,589 --> 00:32:39,918
and we have this one this flower that

621
00:32:35,598 --> 00:32:42,470
but is the number of parts the suppose

622
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:45,769
are three you have a very distinctive

623
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:47,989
type of venation but the most important

624
00:32:45,769 --> 00:32:50,298
thing are the pillows which are here and

625
00:32:47,989 --> 00:32:53,389
this is characteristic of one of the

626
00:32:50,298 --> 00:32:56,749
groups between their fight within the

627
00:32:53,388 --> 00:32:59,088
family and each day is key CAC and we

628
00:32:56,749 --> 00:33:02,579
found the pollen grains within the

629
00:32:59,088 --> 00:33:06,720
anthers again we included a phylogenetic

630
00:33:02,579 --> 00:33:09,029
and his place as the sister of the crank

631
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:10,799
group excuse Oh Mary and this is

632
00:33:09,029 --> 00:33:12,690
important because later on I will show

633
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:16,589
you another fossil that belongs to the

634
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:19,380
same group another Coonan yes see this

635
00:33:16,589 --> 00:33:21,809
is Kenyatta be careful akka and again we

636
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:24,630
found the distinctive on EAC

637
00:33:21,809 --> 00:33:26,819
morphology we found the pollen grains in

638
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:29,460
situ here and these are the pollen

639
00:33:26,819 --> 00:33:31,980
grains of ammonia and Colombia which are

640
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:34,829
two of the general diet grows in

641
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:37,140
Argentina today and again it was

642
00:33:34,829 --> 00:33:40,500
included in a phylogenetic context and

643
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:47,430
this one feeds as the core in the base

644
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:49,289
of the core of the whole punani AC what

645
00:33:47,430 --> 00:33:51,750
are the two philetus laguna alum code

646
00:33:49,289 --> 00:33:54,559
does considered to be one of the largest

647
00:33:51,750 --> 00:33:57,869
volcanic rock lastic complex worldwide

648
00:33:54,559 --> 00:34:00,029
the photo comes from two facials mats

649
00:33:57,869 --> 00:34:02,399
and these are representing caldera like

650
00:34:00,029 --> 00:34:06,000
deposits exactly the same as if today

651
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:09,840
Yellowstone will erupt we know exactly

652
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:12,510
the age fifty two million years ago and

653
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:17,220
this is actually one of the highest

654
00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:22,260
value by orders worldwide and is highest

655
00:34:17,219 --> 00:34:26,129
is the richest years in Flores were why

656
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:28,740
even comparing with United States we

657
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:33,119
have found Toledo fight gymnosperms and

658
00:34:28,739 --> 00:34:36,869
several unjust firms and these are some

659
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:40,380
of the gymnosperms as retro feelin in

00:34:44,519 --> 00:34:50,730
is only found in certain areas of

664
00:34:48,030 --> 00:34:53,340
Australasia we shops dingo it is and

665
00:34:50,730 --> 00:34:57,780
this is the cuticle as you can see here

666
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:59,640
this is the last record of dingo areas

667
00:34:57,780 --> 00:35:02,490
worldwide and this is the one that gave

668
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:04,949
origin to the Gingles as we know today

669
00:35:02,489 --> 00:35:10,049
and then we have our Stroh Samia

670
00:35:04,949 --> 00:35:14,789
which is in the seeker AAC among those

671
00:35:10,050 --> 00:35:16,080
we found the oldest record of eucalyptus

672
00:35:14,789 --> 00:35:17,639
and

673
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:19,799
of the things that is important is we

674
00:35:17,639 --> 00:35:23,309
have a whole plant there we have the

675
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:25,890
Leafs with a typical type of by nation

676
00:35:23,309 --> 00:35:29,759
we have deep roots there are the

677
00:35:25,889 --> 00:35:32,429
capsules that have the bulbs and we have

678
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:35,820
flowers and within the flowers we were

679
00:35:32,429 --> 00:35:38,549
able to obtain pollen grains and these

680
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:42,269
pulling grains are what if you find an

681
00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:45,450
isolated as military Severus eucalyptus

682
00:35:42,269 --> 00:35:47,579
and this is the type that is considered

683
00:35:45,449 --> 00:35:53,059
to be the precursor of the genus

684
00:35:47,579 --> 00:35:56,340
eucalyptus or eucalyptus so again we are

685
00:35:53,059 --> 00:35:59,009
included in a phylogenetic context this

686
00:35:56,340 --> 00:36:01,350
is isolated multi seed ideas and as we

687
00:35:59,010 --> 00:36:06,390
can see the Patagonian fossils are

688
00:36:01,349 --> 00:36:08,219
placed within the genus eucalyptus this

689
00:36:06,389 --> 00:36:10,799
is the other kunin yes see that we found

690
00:36:08,219 --> 00:36:13,859
this is remember this is tertiary these

691
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:15,030
belongs again to the super our to the

692
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:19,890
tribe is key so Mary

693
00:36:15,030 --> 00:36:22,410
these are the fruits we have other

694
00:36:19,889 --> 00:36:24,329
colony acid that we are being a study at

695
00:36:22,409 --> 00:36:26,819
this point but as you can see this is

696
00:36:24,329 --> 00:36:30,000
modern way money these are characterized

697
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:31,410
by having these a capsules that open

698
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:34,980
with two bulbs and they have the

699
00:36:31,409 --> 00:36:37,139
remnants of their styles and you can see

700
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:41,519
this one is one of those with this

701
00:36:37,139 --> 00:36:44,099
typical opening with the Stars and we

702
00:36:41,519 --> 00:36:46,289
have another one here these are totally

703
00:36:44,099 --> 00:36:48,269
two different types of fossils these at

704
00:36:46,289 --> 00:36:51,090
the typical pinnacle and this is a

705
00:36:48,269 --> 00:36:53,219
typical regime so we know the colony was

706
00:36:51,090 --> 00:36:58,620
much more diverse that when we have

707
00:36:53,219 --> 00:37:02,339
today in living we have also fossils of

708
00:36:58,619 --> 00:37:04,199
the jigglin day see these are correct

709
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:08,430
these are fruits they are not less and

710
00:37:04,199 --> 00:37:12,199
these allow us to actually we did a CT

711
00:37:08,429 --> 00:37:14,519
scan to actually observe that the

712
00:37:12,199 --> 00:37:17,159
embryos and the cotyledons

713
00:37:14,519 --> 00:37:20,519
are separated in four and they are

714
00:37:17,159 --> 00:37:24,690
together dusky to determine if these

715
00:37:20,519 --> 00:37:26,940
belong to two gland AC or not again we

716
00:37:24,690 --> 00:37:29,039
included in a phylogenetic context and

717
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:32,188
it fits within the angle gar

718
00:37:29,039 --> 00:37:35,549
yo D and angle gallery are represented

719
00:37:32,188 --> 00:37:38,098
today in the northern part of South

720
00:37:35,548 --> 00:37:42,778
America and Central America there's node

721
00:37:38,099 --> 00:37:45,059
in Argentina and of course we have

722
00:37:42,778 --> 00:37:47,728
stolen a seed that was so really

723
00:37:45,059 --> 00:37:50,609
important because Solanaceae are mostly

724
00:37:47,728 --> 00:37:53,698
herbaceous thing they are very important

725
00:37:50,608 --> 00:37:58,199
a group for crops but we found this

726
00:37:53,699 --> 00:38:01,409
beautiful preserve very similar to the

727
00:37:58,199 --> 00:38:03,688
modern some of the border general and in

728
00:38:01,409 --> 00:38:07,588
this case very similar to the fruits

729
00:38:03,688 --> 00:38:12,118
that are produced by Sally's the family

730
00:38:07,588 --> 00:38:16,909
is today were Y distributed we know that

731
00:38:12,119 --> 00:38:20,880
the origin of the family is the this

732
00:38:16,909 --> 00:38:23,788
South America and one of the things is

733
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:26,039
that we were able to infer the provide

734
00:38:23,789 --> 00:38:28,259
that we are distributed they were

735
00:38:26,039 --> 00:38:32,569
dispersed by the rivers because these

736
00:38:28,259 --> 00:38:36,778
have the syndrome of the floating calyx

737
00:38:32,568 --> 00:38:39,358
again we place it I don't expect for you

738
00:38:36,778 --> 00:38:43,739
to read this but we place it here within

739
00:38:39,358 --> 00:38:46,108
the corpus Alice so we have actually

740
00:38:43,739 --> 00:38:48,239
northern connections or some connections

741
00:38:46,108 --> 00:38:51,449
fountain connections so in the northern

742
00:38:48,239 --> 00:38:53,159
connection this is they actually this is

743
00:38:51,449 --> 00:38:53,699
they must strict in the Scout you will

744
00:38:53,159 --> 00:38:57,179
see it

745
00:38:53,699 --> 00:39:00,869
we have regnal idiom we have the Marcy

746
00:38:57,179 --> 00:39:03,150
Lea area Sola we have grains of disease

747
00:39:00,869 --> 00:39:07,559
actually organized a poly nightís which

748
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:10,019
is a deficit we have array see this is

749
00:39:07,559 --> 00:39:13,528
the oldest record DC said the genius

750
00:39:10,018 --> 00:39:15,928
pandan itis which is an array see this

751
00:39:13,528 --> 00:39:18,028
is praveen actually we find also the

752
00:39:15,929 --> 00:39:21,599
mega fossils

753
00:39:18,028 --> 00:39:26,369
those are aquatic plants and of course

754
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:28,979
we have not a fat adidas we have certain

755
00:39:26,369 --> 00:39:31,979
connection is indicated also by these

756
00:39:28,978 --> 00:39:34,558
fern this is the genus todya we have

757
00:39:31,978 --> 00:39:36,958
agate is in their locker a see we have

758
00:39:34,559 --> 00:39:39,269
the jigglin they see we have gymnast oma

759
00:39:36,958 --> 00:39:42,279
which is Kathryn acid today this is

760
00:39:39,268 --> 00:39:46,449
totally extinct in Argentina and

761
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:50,590
grows in certain parts of Australasia we

762
00:39:46,449 --> 00:39:52,000
have the eucalyptus and we have several

763
00:39:50,590 --> 00:39:55,150
Kanye Seng

764
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:57,789
so based on this information what we can

765
00:39:55,150 --> 00:40:01,570
say actually is that we can observe

766
00:39:57,789 --> 00:40:04,090
certain evolutionary processes such as

767
00:40:01,570 --> 00:40:08,130
extinction we don't have a godís or

768
00:40:04,090 --> 00:40:11,950
eucalyptus or Kasserine AC anymore in

769
00:40:08,130 --> 00:40:14,050
South America however they are all of

770
00:40:11,949 --> 00:40:18,639
those are represented by the oldest

771
00:40:14,050 --> 00:40:21,340
records in the Eocene of Argentina we

772
00:40:18,639 --> 00:40:23,440
have also an expansion we have this

773
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:26,380
Alvin Ailey's those are the aquatic

774
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:28,869
ferns we have they are a sea we have not

775
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:31,510
Apogee kundunese he amputee sea which

776
00:40:28,869 --> 00:40:34,599
have expanded based on the fossil record

777
00:40:31,510 --> 00:40:36,790
to other areas of South America and the

778
00:40:34,599 --> 00:40:39,670
south and hemisphere we have definitive

779
00:40:36,789 --> 00:40:42,610
retraction of several taxes such as Rek

780
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:44,889
see remember if we have here the palms

781
00:40:42,610 --> 00:40:47,320
and now they are restricted to this area

782
00:40:44,889 --> 00:40:49,509
they are really retracted based on

783
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:53,110
paleontology we can say the same about

784
00:40:49,510 --> 00:40:55,390
the family rubiaceae and finally there

785
00:40:53,110 --> 00:40:57,940
are several things that are explaining

786
00:40:55,389 --> 00:41:00,969
disjunction models such as the familiar

787
00:40:57,940 --> 00:41:03,280
winter a/c and iraq reac which have

788
00:41:00,969 --> 00:41:05,529
discharge we have some of those in the

789
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:11,290
northern part of Argentina some in the

790
00:41:05,530 --> 00:41:13,930
south so in summary I want to make sure

791
00:41:11,289 --> 00:41:17,289
that you know that actually fossils are

792
00:41:13,929 --> 00:41:19,449
really critical and they provide an

793
00:41:17,289 --> 00:41:21,460
unprecedent worth of information not

794
00:41:19,449 --> 00:41:24,879
only on Cretaceous and tertiary Flores

795
00:41:21,460 --> 00:41:28,389
but also if we compare them with ekstam

796
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:30,460
Flores to understand certain things they

797
00:41:28,389 --> 00:41:32,079
provide knowledge on past south and

798
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:33,880
distribution which is critical for

799
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:37,029
understanding modern global distribution

800
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:40,410
if you remember the first slide I said

801
00:41:37,030 --> 00:41:43,480
that was an estimate a symmetry in the

802
00:41:40,409 --> 00:41:45,129
latitudinal gradients of diversity so

803
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:46,289
this is proving that that is actually

804
00:41:45,130 --> 00:41:49,570
occurring

805
00:41:46,289 --> 00:41:51,880
these Polly Flores are certain relevant

806
00:41:49,570 --> 00:41:55,210
for explaining modern high diversity

807
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:55,890
centers and evolutionary processes are

808
00:41:55,210 --> 00:41:57,690
really

809
00:41:55,889 --> 00:42:01,798
in the Palio floristic record of

810
00:41:57,690 --> 00:42:05,130
Patagonia and for all of you we actually

811
00:42:01,798 --> 00:42:07,380
we need to celebrate the past to awaken

812
00:42:05,130 --> 00:42:10,200
their future and that is because we

813
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:13,349
actually genomic information is

814
00:42:10,199 --> 00:42:15,568
extremely important molecular data is

815
00:42:13,349 --> 00:42:18,900
critical but also we have the other

816
00:42:15,568 --> 00:42:21,748
component so we have if we don't study

817
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:23,940
the taxonomy past distribution modern

818
00:42:21,748 --> 00:42:25,679
distribution we are missing a lot of

819
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:29,009
critical information that helped us to

820
00:42:25,679 --> 00:42:31,739
understand actually the value of that

821
00:42:29,009 --> 00:42:36,690
genomic and molecular data with that I

822
00:42:31,739 --> 00:42:40,980
say thank you this has been funded by

823
00:42:36,690 --> 00:42:44,999
several agencies NSF may full Brian

824
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:47,400
Coney said nothing of this can be done

825
00:42:44,998 --> 00:42:51,268
without the staff of the museum people

826
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:54,869
here Cornell has a fantastic herbarium

827
00:42:51,268 --> 00:42:57,268
which I use quite frequently we cannot

828
00:42:54,869 --> 00:43:02,430
do this work if we didn't have access to

829
00:42:57,268 --> 00:43:27,258
all of our our sites and to my to

830
00:43:02,429 --> 00:43:31,190
becomes question yes it's a it's a task

831
00:43:27,259 --> 00:43:34,528
so first of all we really clean them so

832
00:43:31,190 --> 00:43:37,230
that in in the field we we get the big

833
00:43:34,528 --> 00:43:40,230
rocks and we treat them there so we

834
00:43:37,230 --> 00:43:42,719
don't carry all that the way to the to

835
00:43:40,230 --> 00:43:45,088
the field these collections are

836
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:48,689
approximately Laguna del junco has more

837
00:43:45,088 --> 00:43:51,389
than a thousand specimens total so what

838
00:43:48,690 --> 00:43:54,599
the dual later is when we get into their

839
00:43:51,389 --> 00:43:58,068
lab we trim them again and we have a

840
00:43:54,599 --> 00:44:01,798
special tools to treat them demean

841
00:43:58,068 --> 00:44:05,219
two-dimensionally and then if possible

842
00:44:01,798 --> 00:44:07,318
we wash them with water and after that

843
00:44:05,219 --> 00:44:08,799
we just put it on their cameras and take

844
00:44:07,318 --> 00:44:14,170
the pictures

845
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:16,660
oh he buries a virus we have things that

846
00:44:14,170 --> 00:44:36,070
are mystic and we have things that are

847
00:44:16,659 --> 00:44:39,460
distinct yeah oh okay yeah yeah I got I

848
00:44:36,070 --> 00:44:57,220
go all the way down and then I go here

849
00:44:39,460 --> 00:45:02,050
and you know no is there strong

850
00:44:57,219 --> 00:45:05,849
directionality as to the north-south

851
00:45:02,050 --> 00:45:08,289
direction we do okay we do actually and

852
00:45:05,849 --> 00:45:10,389
of course I don't have the time to

853
00:45:08,289 --> 00:45:14,320
explain all these so what's happening is

854
00:45:10,389 --> 00:45:17,739
based on the position of Patagonia

855
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:20,140
during this time he was still connected

856
00:45:17,739 --> 00:45:22,779
to Antarctica so what we are doing is

857
00:45:20,139 --> 00:45:25,900
actually we are missing all the record

858
00:45:22,780 --> 00:45:28,930
for Antarctica now the peninsula and

859
00:45:25,900 --> 00:45:30,460
several of the islands that are close to

860
00:45:28,929 --> 00:45:32,859
the Antarctic Peninsula during the

861
00:45:30,460 --> 00:45:36,220
summer you can go and collect so that's

862
00:45:32,860 --> 00:45:38,410
the next step there are very few works

863
00:45:36,219 --> 00:45:44,589
that have been done there it started in

864
00:45:38,409 --> 00:45:46,029
the 1900 with the treats of northern

865
00:45:44,590 --> 00:45:50,950
whole with the boat called the

866
00:45:46,030 --> 00:45:53,650
Antarctica he was his his father was a

867
00:45:50,949 --> 00:45:56,500
geology so early on in his life although

868
00:45:53,650 --> 00:45:58,780
he was a person that was interested in

869
00:45:56,500 --> 00:46:00,849
hunting whales and that's why they did

870
00:45:58,780 --> 00:46:03,370
the trip with Antarctica

871
00:46:00,849 --> 00:46:05,980
they were interested he was interested

872
00:46:03,369 --> 00:46:08,199
in collecting rocks so he collected

873
00:46:05,980 --> 00:46:10,659
actually a bunch of fossils that are

874
00:46:08,199 --> 00:46:13,529
considered now today they also type for

875
00:46:10,659 --> 00:46:17,859
the oldest records for not the faggus

876
00:46:13,530 --> 00:46:20,410
those who are a study in sweden by north

877
00:46:17,860 --> 00:46:22,010
by Doosan which is a very famous

878
00:46:20,409 --> 00:46:25,129
paleobotanist

879
00:46:22,010 --> 00:46:28,100
so there are material there and we are

880
00:46:25,130 --> 00:46:30,050
trying to to get to it so if everything

881
00:46:28,099 --> 00:46:32,239
goes okay maybe in a couple of years I

882
00:46:30,050 --> 00:46:35,840
would be going there and collect and

883
00:46:32,239 --> 00:46:38,799
those we the nice thing about these is

884
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:42,320
that they will have the whole sequence

885
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:44,750
from the Maastricht and all the way

886
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:48,019
actually to the myosin there are very

887
00:46:44,750 --> 00:46:51,949
interesting things happening here and we

888
00:46:48,019 --> 00:46:54,108
have myosin Florez to pick Flora's in

889
00:46:51,949 --> 00:46:57,529
Tierra del Fuego and those are critical

890
00:46:54,108 --> 00:47:02,449
because does when almost all the species

891
00:46:57,530 --> 00:47:07,580
of North follows are recorded so the

892
00:47:02,449 --> 00:47:10,339
knot of our screw goes this way but we

893
00:47:07,579 --> 00:47:12,940
actually did all this record is falling

894
00:47:10,340 --> 00:47:18,230
grains from the maastricht end of

895
00:47:12,940 --> 00:47:25,039
Antarctica so when do you start to see

896
00:47:18,230 --> 00:47:29,750
the current it does it just depends so

897
00:47:25,039 --> 00:47:31,269
then the last big thing that appear

898
00:47:29,750 --> 00:47:34,969
where the Andes

899
00:47:31,269 --> 00:47:36,889
that they started to elevate during the

900
00:47:34,969 --> 00:47:40,299
Maya scene and at the end is when we

901
00:47:36,889 --> 00:47:43,429
start to see already the artists area

902
00:47:40,300 --> 00:47:50,019
already the diagonal already established

903
00:47:43,429 --> 00:47:54,699
so it's still there biggest changes are

904
00:47:50,019 --> 00:47:57,980
mostly observed after the PTM there

905
00:47:54,699 --> 00:48:02,059
paleocene-eocene thermal maximum thus

906
00:47:57,980 --> 00:48:04,190
when the geological aspects does when

907
00:48:02,059 --> 00:48:07,880
the current the Antarctic currents start

908
00:48:04,190 --> 00:48:10,190
to be more prominent so is when during

909
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:12,619
the Oligocene you start to observe the

910
00:48:10,190 --> 00:48:14,809
curve already the temperatures start to

911
00:48:12,619 --> 00:48:16,579
go down and at the beginning of the olio

912
00:48:14,809 --> 00:48:19,039
scene is when you start to see the

913
00:48:16,579 --> 00:48:21,049
elation in antarctica so all those

914
00:48:19,039 --> 00:48:26,119
things are affecting what you are

915
00:48:21,050 --> 00:48:28,400
getting into the into Patagonia and this

916
00:48:26,119 --> 00:48:30,200
is only this is based not only in the

917
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:35,760
data I presented today of course there

918
00:48:30,199 --> 00:48:37,439
are many many examples so

919
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:39,869
with for example with the north of ours

920
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:42,030
we start to observe when notify us

921
00:48:39,869 --> 00:48:44,450
appears also missiles and races start to

922
00:48:42,030 --> 00:48:48,630
appear and we know that miss addendum is

923
00:48:44,449 --> 00:48:50,819
actually simpler ik with not follows he

924
00:48:48,630 --> 00:49:02,160
grows all your not foul so we start to

925
00:48:50,820 --> 00:49:12,809
observe as well those kind of events all

926
00:49:02,159 --> 00:49:15,539
the major clades we this this is

927
00:49:12,809 --> 00:49:17,880
actually kind of noon and one of the

928
00:49:15,539 --> 00:49:19,980
things is something hemisphere is

929
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:22,769
considered to be extremely under sample

930
00:49:19,980 --> 00:49:27,300
and there are many biases why this is

931
00:49:22,769 --> 00:49:29,190
occurring first again is oceanic is now

932
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:31,170
considered to be continental so there's

933
00:49:29,190 --> 00:49:32,099
no too many long where you can go and

934
00:49:31,170 --> 00:49:36,180
look for fossils

935
00:49:32,099 --> 00:49:39,289
then there's for example you have africa

936
00:49:36,179 --> 00:49:41,789
africa is almost doesn't have almost any

937
00:49:39,289 --> 00:49:46,409
sedimentary rocks which is where you

938
00:49:41,789 --> 00:49:49,590
find the fossils and then until not too

939
00:49:46,409 --> 00:49:51,480
many years ago i nobody was interested

940
00:49:49,590 --> 00:49:53,100
in what was happening in South and

941
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:54,900
hemisphere because you could explain

942
00:49:53,099 --> 00:49:56,699
everything studying things in the

943
00:49:54,900 --> 00:50:01,170
northern hemisphere actually the

944
00:49:56,699 --> 00:50:03,118
original original Polly botanist we are

945
00:50:01,170 --> 00:50:05,909
from the northern hemisphere so the way

946
00:50:03,119 --> 00:50:09,450
that these Flores were collected until

947
00:50:05,909 --> 00:50:11,849
their fifties was based on all companies

948
00:50:09,449 --> 00:50:15,868
so they send the geologists to respect

949
00:50:11,849 --> 00:50:17,368
for oil they collect some fossils they

950
00:50:15,869 --> 00:50:20,760
bring them to United States and they

951
00:50:17,369 --> 00:50:23,700
study them so until the 50 that was the

952
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:26,580
methodology after the 50s 1950s the

953
00:50:23,699 --> 00:50:29,809
thing is start to change and more people

954
00:50:26,579 --> 00:50:32,279
was more involved in other aspects of

955
00:50:29,809 --> 00:50:37,230
Palio botany not just you know

956
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:39,900
indicators of oil so we are trying to

957
00:50:37,230 --> 00:50:42,809
collect we expect that we will find

958
00:50:39,900 --> 00:50:44,760
actually more interesting things for

959
00:50:42,809 --> 00:50:48,599
example we have the genus value Isola

960
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:49,800
and poly Isola has actually three mega

961
00:50:48,599 --> 00:50:53,099
sports that we call

962
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:57,630
see that that are viable and without any

963
00:50:53,099 --> 00:51:00,569
doubt he belongs to salvini Elias it

964
00:50:57,630 --> 00:51:02,340
belongs he said it's an aquatic firm so

965
00:51:00,570 --> 00:51:04,860
there are all those things that we still

966
00:51:02,340 --> 00:51:12,660
need to experiment with thank you so

967
00:51:04,860 --> 00:51:16,349
much this has been a production of

968
00:51:12,659 --> 00:51:19,279
