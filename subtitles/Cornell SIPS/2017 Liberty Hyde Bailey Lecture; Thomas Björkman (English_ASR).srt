1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,309
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,679 --> 00:00:04,309
University

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:16,079
thanks very much very nice to see you

4
00:00:10,689 --> 00:00:20,519
all here I need to go back to my first

5
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:24,278
so I'm going to talk to you about a

6
00:00:20,519 --> 00:00:27,429
perhaps more commonplace vegetable than

7
00:00:24,278 --> 00:00:32,189
what you heard about and how it fits in

8
00:00:27,429 --> 00:00:34,899
the food revolution and that is broccoli

9
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:37,149
get this guy to go so there is a

10
00:00:34,899 --> 00:00:38,558
revolution in the food system when it

11
00:00:37,149 --> 00:00:41,859
comes to vegetables there's a

12
00:00:38,558 --> 00:00:45,280
revolutionary rise in consumption that

13
00:00:41,859 --> 00:00:49,048
you may not even be aware of so this is

14
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:54,039
a graph of how much broccoli people eat

15
00:00:49,048 --> 00:00:56,890
in a year in America and it may surprise

16
00:00:54,039 --> 00:00:58,868
you that sometime earlier in your

17
00:00:56,890 --> 00:01:01,899
lifetime people in America did not eat

18
00:00:58,868 --> 00:01:04,989
broccoli pretty much it wasn't very well

19
00:01:01,899 --> 00:01:08,819
known at all and there's been a pretty

20
00:01:04,989 --> 00:01:11,170
much continuous rise since about 1970

21
00:01:08,819 --> 00:01:14,859
partly as a result of introduction of

22
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:17,740
some high high quality hybrid broccoli

23
00:01:14,859 --> 00:01:20,260
varieties in the 1960s and so the

24
00:01:17,739 --> 00:01:22,989
production was able to rise and broccoli

25
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:25,300
is actually one of the most consumed of

26
00:01:22,989 --> 00:01:27,429
the cooked green vegetables so that the

27
00:01:25,299 --> 00:01:29,349
biggies are tomatoes and potatoes

28
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:32,440
in other words pizza and french fries

29
00:01:29,349 --> 00:01:35,169
right so we're talking about public

30
00:01:32,439 --> 00:01:38,469
health and increasing vegetable

31
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:40,540
consumption with that public health goal

32
00:01:38,469 --> 00:01:41,920
so the pizza and fries are probably not

33
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:44,140
the ones we want to be leading with

34
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:46,750
broccoli is one that's sort of a symbol

35
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:49,659
of a healthy food so there's a

36
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:53,200
revolution going on in the consumption

37
00:01:49,659 --> 00:01:55,659
and we're working on a revolution in

38
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:59,079
where that is happening so this is a

39
00:01:55,659 --> 00:02:01,330
graph that or a diagram that shows where

40
00:01:59,079 --> 00:02:05,530
broccoli is currently produced so orange

41
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:06,789
is summertime blue is wintertime and you

42
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:09,158
can see right away there's some big

43
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:10,659
blobs in California that is where the

44
00:02:09,158 --> 00:02:13,959
broccoli comes from the desert in the

45
00:02:10,658 --> 00:02:16,840
wintertime and on the cold Pacific coast

46
00:02:13,959 --> 00:02:20,650
where the fog comes in at night and

47
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:23,769
broccoli happy in the summertime it is

48
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:25,539
possible to grow in the east as long as

49
00:02:23,769 --> 00:02:29,379
you're in the northern most coldest

50
00:02:25,539 --> 00:02:31,929
county in these and it is possible to

51
00:02:29,378 --> 00:02:33,609
grow in the winter if you are in a

52
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:36,159
particular spot in the sheltered

53
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:37,599
Atlantic coast of Florida not too far

54
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:39,969
north or too far south so there's a

55
00:02:37,598 --> 00:02:44,469
couple of spots where it has been

56
00:02:39,969 --> 00:02:47,409
working but if we're going to really

57
00:02:44,469 --> 00:02:50,739
increase the production across the

58
00:02:47,409 --> 00:02:52,989
country increase the availability for

59
00:02:50,739 --> 00:02:55,689
people who want local and there is a

60
00:02:52,989 --> 00:02:58,450
considerable demand for local in the

61
00:02:55,689 --> 00:03:01,209
east and also if we want to think about

62
00:02:58,449 --> 00:03:04,419
this food security in the country so

63
00:03:01,209 --> 00:03:08,590
last year in California was very driest

64
00:03:04,419 --> 00:03:10,869
and probably heard and in those coastal

65
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:13,450
counties where they were irrigating the

66
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:15,489
broccoli from wells they depleted the

67
00:03:13,449 --> 00:03:18,399
water table so far down that the Pacific

68
00:03:15,489 --> 00:03:21,039
Ocean started moving in underneath some

69
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,930
of the best farmland in the country so

70
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:26,650
that's not a good thing that puts us at

71
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:28,689
risk to be dependent on creating that

72
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:30,879
sort of problem so distributing the

73
00:03:28,689 --> 00:03:33,729
production across the country is good

74
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:35,289
not only to meet the local demand the

75
00:03:33,729 --> 00:03:36,939
environmental benefits of that but

76
00:03:35,289 --> 00:03:38,888
really to make sure that we have a

77
00:03:36,939 --> 00:03:40,269
secure supply of some of these

78
00:03:38,889 --> 00:03:44,170
vegetables that are critical to our

79
00:03:40,269 --> 00:03:46,090
health so the challenge with moving the

80
00:03:44,169 --> 00:03:48,638
broccoli over since you see it's pretty

81
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:50,739
polarized on the East Coast is that

82
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:52,930
we're trying to make it grow in a place

83
00:03:50,739 --> 00:03:55,870
that it really doesn't want to in the

84
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:58,569
summertime in the East it's warm and

85
00:03:55,870 --> 00:04:01,870
humid at night and the broccoli depends

86
00:03:58,568 --> 00:04:07,918
on cool temperatures to become broccoli

87
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:10,389
and what we see in the marketplace very

88
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:14,079
specific parts of what's actually a

89
00:04:10,389 --> 00:04:19,168
continuum in nature and so these are

90
00:04:14,079 --> 00:04:21,819
some very closely related genotypes at

91
00:04:19,168 --> 00:04:24,490
what we'd call harvest maturity and you

92
00:04:21,819 --> 00:04:26,168
probably recognize the first one so

93
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:28,930
that's that's a familiar market class

94
00:04:26,168 --> 00:04:29,810
this is actually sold as a product in

95
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:32,418
part

96
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:35,959
written in Italy this one's called

97
00:04:32,418 --> 00:04:38,779
purple cauliflower this one you pretty

98
00:04:35,959 --> 00:04:40,879
much can't buy that the denia recognizes

99
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:44,239
the typical supermarket broccoli and

100
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:45,680
mrs. Sarah Chinese kale so that what's

101
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,990
happening here is the flower buds are

102
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:51,590
getting bigger at maturity and there's a

103
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:53,629
there's a huge range of what's possible

104
00:04:51,589 --> 00:04:56,168
and we only like those two in the u.s.

105
00:04:53,629 --> 00:05:00,019
marketplace it has to get exactly that

106
00:04:56,168 --> 00:05:01,909
and so the problem is when we move a

107
00:05:00,019 --> 00:05:03,409
California variety to the East Coast and

108
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:05,930
grow it during the growing season it

109
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:12,830
doesn't know what to do it produces this

110
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:14,418
you're not going to buy that and even

111
00:05:12,829 --> 00:05:19,519
the varieties that were developed for

112
00:05:14,418 --> 00:05:21,560
the summertime produce this and you're

113
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:22,969
still not going to buy that you're not

114
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:28,910
going to have the opportunity to buy

115
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:32,720
that so this is where we think about how

116
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:36,950
to develop broccoli that meets the

117
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:38,900
consumer demand and so what can we do to

118
00:05:36,949 --> 00:05:41,810
identify the consumer demand so I'll

119
00:05:38,899 --> 00:05:43,879
start with that part that you might say

120
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:46,160
well you know it's local people will

121
00:05:43,879 --> 00:05:49,279
accept that it's okay if it's local the

122
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:52,490
the weird weird look good taste fine

123
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:54,769
cooks fine the yields fine people will

124
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:57,769
just educate the consumer and make them

125
00:05:54,769 --> 00:06:00,168
accept this and I experienced with

126
00:05:57,769 --> 00:06:03,490
educating consumers to do what we think

127
00:06:00,168 --> 00:06:06,259
they should do is very very limited I

128
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:08,389
don't even try anymore

129
00:06:06,259 --> 00:06:11,478
the second factor in this is that

130
00:06:08,389 --> 00:06:15,560
there's a very specific gatekeeper the

131
00:06:11,478 --> 00:06:18,050
supermarket produce warehouseman they

132
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:21,610
accept the product so when a truck comes

133
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:23,900
up with vegetables for that supermarket

134
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:26,090
they go through and they decide which of

135
00:06:23,899 --> 00:06:27,739
it they're actually going to buy if it's

136
00:06:26,089 --> 00:06:29,269
not good enough they send it back with

137
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:33,769
the farmer and when it's a perishable

138
00:06:29,269 --> 00:06:36,469
product that has essentially no value so

139
00:06:33,769 --> 00:06:39,079
the risk of delivering something that's

140
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:42,480
not absolutely acceptable to the

141
00:06:39,079 --> 00:06:46,370
supermarket buyer is enormous you

142
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:46,370
can't take that risk as a as a grower

143
00:06:47,689 --> 00:06:51,930
with broccoli there I think they're

144
00:06:50,069 --> 00:06:53,849
especially finicky because broccoli is

145
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:56,850
sort of a comfort food for a lot of

146
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:58,980
people and so our comfort zone on

147
00:06:56,850 --> 00:07:01,379
comfort foods is pretty narrow

148
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:04,740
we like familiarity with comfort foods

149
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:07,139
we like novelty in other areas but we

150
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:11,250
want our comfort foods to be very

151
00:07:07,139 --> 00:07:13,199
consistent and so that's where getting

152
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:15,540
the broccoli to stop doing these things

153
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:18,779
that's fun I put in there it froze

154
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:22,410
leaves out also so what we've done with

155
00:07:18,779 --> 00:07:25,409
a rather large team of scientists and

156
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:27,720
breeders is to do a lot of science which

157
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:30,420
I won't you any details of website

158
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:33,120
either these are the developing flower

159
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:35,129
buds and the white stuff our genes

160
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,509
turning on the control the enlargement

161
00:07:35,129 --> 00:07:38,670
of the flowers which is the process

162
00:07:36,509 --> 00:07:42,199
we're looking at and so we've taken my

163
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:44,939
latest techniques in genomics the

164
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:47,459
genetic resources that are available in

165
00:07:44,939 --> 00:07:49,800
the germ plasm collections worldwide and

166
00:07:47,459 --> 00:07:51,299
in the commercial breeding programs we

167
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:53,120
work very closely with commercial

168
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:56,819
breeders as well as the public breeders

169
00:07:53,120 --> 00:08:00,269
to bring all that to bear on developing

170
00:07:56,819 --> 00:08:02,219
a broccoli that will look normal even

171
00:08:00,269 --> 00:08:03,949
though the temperatures it's experience

172
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:09,420
or anything but normal

173
00:08:03,949 --> 00:08:11,509
based on its expectations and so this is

174
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:13,949
what we have now that's actually a

175
00:08:11,509 --> 00:08:16,199
recently released commercial variety

176
00:08:13,949 --> 00:08:18,000
that was grown here last summer when it

177
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:23,610
was very very hot and I took all those

178
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:28,199
other pictures of other materials so

179
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:33,259
we've gotten to the point where we can

180
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:39,529
have what looks like a normal flower bud

181
00:08:33,259 --> 00:08:42,539
development so we are working with the

182
00:08:39,529 --> 00:08:44,819
the Wilder material that was brought in

183
00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:46,169
that's part of the public programs is

184
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:49,590
where the public programs are absolutely

185
00:08:46,169 --> 00:08:52,240
critical they'll make crosses that

186
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:56,830
wouldn't even be considered in the

187
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:59,799
private industry and then actually

188
00:08:56,830 --> 00:09:02,200
license that material to the commercial

189
00:08:59,799 --> 00:09:03,909
companies who then develop varieties and

190
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:06,100
sell those varieties that's what they're

191
00:09:03,909 --> 00:09:10,959
good at so we've got a good team going

192
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:14,100
to try to bring this out so we're quite

193
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:17,050
far along on solving this problem

194
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:19,870
there's a few challenges that still

195
00:09:17,049 --> 00:09:23,439
remains one of the key things for

196
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:26,259
keeping customers is a year-round supply

197
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:28,750
so having broccoli coming from somewhere

198
00:09:26,259 --> 00:09:30,460
on the East Coast for the entire year is

199
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:33,129
important so that's we're connecting

200
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:35,950
Maine and Florida with New York being a

201
00:09:33,129 --> 00:09:39,129
very large producer for summer and fall

202
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:41,230
is important but the one most

203
00:09:39,129 --> 00:09:44,950
challenging season is the springtime and

204
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:46,629
so I'll show you this is one of the more

205
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:50,350
detailed things that's turning out to be

206
00:09:46,629 --> 00:09:53,740
an issue so they look pretty similar

207
00:09:50,350 --> 00:10:00,879
don't they it turns out there's a

208
00:09:53,740 --> 00:10:03,700
critical difference and that side branch

209
00:10:00,879 --> 00:10:06,610
is relatively short this side branch is

210
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:08,980
a little bit longer it's just enough

211
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:11,259
longer but it's a little bit Wiggly and

212
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:13,450
when you pack all the broccoli together

213
00:10:11,259 --> 00:10:16,350
all those side branches push against

214
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:18,970
each other and wiggle and look ugly

215
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:20,470
that's not okay because then when you

216
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:23,230
put them out on the grocery store shelf

217
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:26,769
they're not attractive enough and the

218
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:28,269
staff will toss them and this happens in

219
00:10:26,769 --> 00:10:29,889
the springtime when it's they've been

220
00:10:28,269 --> 00:10:31,629
growing under cold conditions and then

221
00:10:29,889 --> 00:10:34,029
it starts to warm up and you start to

222
00:10:31,629 --> 00:10:36,250
harvest them then that branch starts to

223
00:10:34,029 --> 00:10:39,100
grow a little bit earlier than it would

224
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:40,929
otherwise place at a tiny detail but it

225
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:45,000
makes a difference between what you can

226
00:10:40,929 --> 00:10:49,149
sell and not sell and there's another

227
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:52,089
difference that shows up if you look at

228
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:53,199
the open spaces in the top of this head

229
00:10:52,089 --> 00:10:55,570
you'll see that they're a little bit

230
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:59,230
smaller than the open spaces in this one

231
00:10:55,570 --> 00:11:01,300
and that means that you have to put four

232
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:04,089
or five more of these heads in a box

233
00:11:01,299 --> 00:11:05,019
than you do of those and again they're

234
00:11:04,089 --> 00:11:08,290
less firm

235
00:11:05,019 --> 00:11:10,480
and so they don't ship as well so those

236
00:11:08,289 --> 00:11:11,949
are issues that we still need to deal

237
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:14,259
with we're discovering this spring issue

238
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:15,220
is actually a fairly new one we didn't

239
00:11:14,259 --> 00:11:16,659
know they were going to do that because

240
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:20,740
nobody was growing it in that season

241
00:11:16,659 --> 00:11:23,279
before and that's we're working with

242
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:26,830
commercial breeders who have experience

243
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:33,100
in adjusting with all of these subtle

244
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:35,920
traits he's coming in because it looks

245
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:37,899
very normal at the end but behind it

246
00:11:35,919 --> 00:11:41,139
we're doing we're really having a

247
00:11:37,899 --> 00:11:43,809
revolution in the amount of consumption

248
00:11:41,139 --> 00:11:46,659
where the production is happening how

249
00:11:43,809 --> 00:11:49,809
we're getting the broccoli to market

250
00:11:46,659 --> 00:11:51,789
from new areas and also the science

251
00:11:49,809 --> 00:11:57,549
behind it learning a whole lot about how

252
00:11:51,789 --> 00:12:01,449
flowers develop and so we're hoping to

253
00:11:57,549 --> 00:12:03,599
see broccoli not develop additional

254
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:08,650
trait like presumptuousness

255
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:12,159
pretentiousness but it's continuing to

256
00:12:08,649 --> 00:12:14,379
be one of the biggest comfort foods and

257
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:16,299
we want to make better broccoli locally

258
00:12:14,379 --> 00:12:23,200
available for as much of the East Coast

259
00:12:16,299 --> 00:12:25,629
as we can thank you this has been a

260
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:30,450
production of Cornell University on the

261
00:12:25,629 --> 00:12:30,450
web at Cornell edu
