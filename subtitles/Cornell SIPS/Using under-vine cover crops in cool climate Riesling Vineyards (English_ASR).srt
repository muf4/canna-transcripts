1
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:05,040
this is a production of cornell

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:05,040
university

3
00:00:09,359 --> 00:00:13,279
i will be presenting on the work i've

4
00:00:11,119 --> 00:00:15,919
done for the last three growing seasons

5
00:00:13,279 --> 00:00:18,079
here at cornell working with justine van

6
00:00:15,919 --> 00:00:20,399
hoovel with thomas bjorkman and anna

7
00:00:18,079 --> 00:00:21,839
katherine mansfield also on my committee

8
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:23,599
the work here for my masters has

9
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:26,079
centered around using undervine cover

10
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:28,800
crops as an herbicide replacement in

11
00:00:26,079 --> 00:00:31,038
cool climate riesling vineyards

12
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,679
so i'll go quickly over the background

13
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:36,320
why am i even bothering to look at this

14
00:00:33,679 --> 00:00:38,479
in for my materials and methods i did

15
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,320
all my experiments at two field sites so

16
00:00:38,479 --> 00:00:41,279
i'll go over over the design at both of

17
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,878
them

18
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:46,558
my different results and at the end of

19
00:00:42,878 --> 00:00:48,718
the day what can we say about this work

20
00:00:46,558 --> 00:00:51,599
so currently it is

21
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:53,520
pretty commonplace to use cover crops at

22
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:57,520
some point in the season between vine

23
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:59,520
rows but it is almost universally kept

24
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:01,280
weed free or vegetation free in the zone

25
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,680
directly beneath vines

26
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:06,159
this bare soil strip is maintained with

27
00:01:03,679 --> 00:01:08,400
a combination or selection of herbicide

28
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:10,560
and or cultivation this is done because

29
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,478
growers perceive that it would be a very

30
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,159
negative effect on vines having

31
00:01:12,478 --> 00:01:15,519
vegetation there it's not so much

32
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:17,118
support in the science literature but

33
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:19,280
it's definitely the perception and that

34
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:21,519
is why it's done

35
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:24,000
so any risk there's always a risk when

36
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:26,079
you introduce an herbicide to a system

37
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,599
not only are you in increasing your

38
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:30,078
chances of resistance in the weed

39
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:31,599
community but you're always offering the

40
00:01:30,078 --> 00:01:32,798
opportunity for these herbicides to

41
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:35,039
leach out

42
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:37,040
or run off this is a special concern

43
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,280
when you're growing vineyards above

44
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,000
lakes like in this region

45
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,478
and if you're worried about

46
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,078
contaminating your ground water sources

47
00:01:42,478 --> 00:01:47,599
and regardless of whether you're using

48
00:01:44,078 --> 00:01:50,239
herbicide or cultivation bare soil is a

49
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:51,839
big risk in terms of your soil health

50
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:53,679
any kind of bear exposed soil is going

51
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,520
to be subject to crusting during a hard

52
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,200
rainfall event which leads to further

53
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:58,560
runoff you get soil structure

54
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,719
degradation

55
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,719
a decrease in organic matter and also

56
00:02:00,718 --> 00:02:04,559
it's very subject to erosion anytime

57
00:02:02,718 --> 00:02:06,559
soil is left bare this is a great

58
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,318
concern when you have vineyards planted

59
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,520
on hillsides which is very common not

60
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:12,238
only here in the finger lakes but

61
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,239
worldwide

62
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,920
so this is all coupled with the fact

63
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:18,560
that if you look at kind of the state of

64
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:22,479
the union of vineyard growth habits in

65
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:25,520
this region we have a lot of very

66
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:27,280
excessively vegetative growing vines for

67
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,120
lack of a better phrase

68
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,640
you can see that picture there the

69
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,840
shoots have not only well extended

70
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:34,479
beyond the trellising but they're

71
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:36,479
starting to grow into the next row

72
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:38,799
we have frequent rainfall throughout the

73
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:40,238
growing season here so water is rarely a

74
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,920
limiting factor

75
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:43,920
many vineyards are planted on what just

76
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:46,238
happened to be very deep in fertile soil

77
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:48,318
sites so though that's not a limiting

78
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:50,560
factor and we also just have selected

79
00:02:48,318 --> 00:02:51,759
due to commercial and production reasons

80
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,759
some varieties that just have a

81
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:55,280
particularly vigorous growth habit so

82
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:57,759
all this sort of creates the perfect

83
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:59,759
trifecta of growing more like jungles

84
00:02:57,759 --> 00:03:01,518
than little vineyards

85
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:03,679
this excessive vegetative growth is a

86
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:05,759
problem because it is associated with

87
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:09,280
very poor resulting grape and wine

88
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:12,000
quality shaded buds are less fruitful

89
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:13,759
a lot of the desirable aromas we want in

90
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,919
our wine are correlated with sunlight

91
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:17,280
exposure so when you have 15 bazillion

92
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:18,958
leaf layers blocking them you're not

93
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,560
going to get a lot of exposure

94
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:22,560
and those conditions are really ripe for

95
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,799
disease all that leaf area is going to

96
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,318
contribute to a higher relative humidity

97
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:28,799
and just make it harder to get into the

98
00:03:26,318 --> 00:03:29,759
canopy to manage your fruit

99
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:31,519
and so

100
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:33,280
given that deleterious effect on the

101
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:35,120
vines from this excessive vegetative

102
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:37,199
growth we spend a lot of time and money

103
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,080
in vineyards maintaining it we'll go

104
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:39,598
through in

105
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,920
pretty much right from the time shoots

106
00:03:39,598 --> 00:03:44,158
burst and have to remove vegetative

107
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:46,479
growth we'll take out shoots we'll leave

108
00:03:44,158 --> 00:03:47,840
thin we'll drop excess clusters we'll

109
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:50,238
drive tractors throughout the entire

110
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:52,479
season to hedge off those tops of shoots

111
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:54,080
but this is all costly and takes lots of

112
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:57,119
time to manage and it's also at the end

113
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:59,760
of the day just treating the problem not

114
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,599
the source of the problem

115
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:03,199
so there's been successful research in

116
00:04:01,598 --> 00:04:05,518
other humid climates that have this

117
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:07,598
excessive growth problem in new zealand

118
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:09,680
long island and virginia that have shown

119
00:04:07,598 --> 00:04:11,919
that when you replace using herbicides

120
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:13,840
direct lander vines and instead plant a

121
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:15,839
very intentionally planted under vine

122
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:17,600
cover crop not only are you eliminating

123
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:20,879
herbicide use but you're actually

124
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:23,439
getting a positive deviating effect

125
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:25,360
however as this californian can tell you

126
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:27,120
the finger lakes is pretty cold

127
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,439
and we aren't as warm as these other

128
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,720
regions so we have sort of a different

129
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:32,478
management

130
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,720
practicality to work around in the

131
00:04:32,478 --> 00:04:36,879
winter we mound up a lot of soil around

132
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,000
the graft union of vines the european

133
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:40,079
grapevines you guys are going to be

134
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,079
familiar with including riesling which

135
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:44,560
is what my research is done on are all

136
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:46,159
planted on rootstock so if we ever had a

137
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,680
really hard freeze these vines would

138
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,040
kill to the ground and all you're going

139
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,160
to be left with is your rootstock which

140
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,000
isn't going to produce your fruit and

141
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,000
you're pretty much back to square one so

142
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,600
by healing up this dirt all over those

143
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,560
graft unions you're ensuring the

144
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:00,479
survival of some scion buds which come

145
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,680
the spring you heal back down you can

146
00:05:00,478 --> 00:05:03,599
grow up

147
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,280
your your riesling or your cab franc or

148
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,280
whatever it may be from those surviving

149
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:08,638
buds and you're not back to square one

150
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:10,799
you still have some work ahead of you

151
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:12,879
but you're not devastated also at the

152
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,560
end of the day crop insurance requires

153
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:15,680
growers to heal up so regardless of

154
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,439
whether you're going to take the chance

155
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,680
or not you're pretty much going to do it

156
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:21,439
so given this

157
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,120
need to heal up vines in the winter and

158
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:25,199
heal them back down in the spring we

159
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:27,199
have to operate on kind of a different

160
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:28,960
system vineyard floor management system

161
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:30,720
than these other regions which showed

162
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:32,959
success with looking at permanently

163
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:35,520
established perennials

164
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:38,000
that's why my objective for my master's

165
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:39,918
work was to look at annually established

166
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,160
undervine cover crop species as an

167
00:05:39,918 --> 00:05:44,639
alternative to herbicide in finger lakes

168
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:47,120
riesling vineyards

169
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:49,759
we hypothesized that given this very

170
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:52,160
common excessive vegetative growth habit

171
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:54,479
of riesling grapevines in the region

172
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:56,240
that there will be no deleterious effect

173
00:05:54,478 --> 00:05:58,800
by introducing this underlying cover

174
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:00,160
crop vegetation with the vines

175
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,000
we actually if anything predict that

176
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:05,120
there would be a positive outcome by

177
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:08,000
reducing this figure

178
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:10,319
so my data sort of stemmed on two sides

179
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,360
of looking at the question the first was

180
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:13,039
looking at different measures of

181
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,680
vegetative growth

182
00:06:13,038 --> 00:06:17,839
right now and subsequently taking some

183
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:20,160
rough measures of vine nutrient and

184
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:21,679
water status for water i looked at

185
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:23,919
midday and pre-dawn stem water

186
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,439
potentials i'll talk about those later

187
00:06:23,918 --> 00:06:27,680
take a quick moment because i'll mention

188
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:30,959
several times enhanced point quadrant

189
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:32,879
analysis or epqa is a way of quantifying

190
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:34,318
the canopy canopy characteristics the

191
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:35,918
number of leaves the number of clusters

192
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:37,919
those sorts of things and the light

193
00:06:35,918 --> 00:06:40,159
environment within the canopy that's

194
00:06:37,918 --> 00:06:41,599
what jim myers did for his phd a former

195
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:44,400
student of justine's he's now a postdoc

196
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:46,479
for us so that's building upon his work

197
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:47,758
and then a petiole were collected at

198
00:06:46,478 --> 00:06:49,680
verizon

199
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:51,598
for nutrient analysis for that side of

200
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,280
things then

201
00:06:51,598 --> 00:06:54,800
i don't just watch the vines grow all

202
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:56,239
season but i do in fact harvest the

203
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,160
fruit and different measures that

204
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:00,720
harvest are taken and then the

205
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:02,800
subsequent juice is analyzed brix is our

206
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,400
measures of sugar so the soluble solids

207
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,240
in the juice sugar is really important

208
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:07,758
because in fermentation sugar goes out

209
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,918
to alcohol

210
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:11,520
ta is short for titratable acidity this

211
00:07:09,918 --> 00:07:14,478
is really important for your perception

212
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:16,560
of acid in the wine and juice ph not

213
00:07:14,478 --> 00:07:18,560
only is it related to acid but really

214
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,478
important for microbial stability in

215
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,000
wines so we don't have bugs that we

216
00:07:20,478 --> 00:07:24,159
don't want growing in there and tainting

217
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,399
your wine and yan is short for yeast

218
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:28,800
assimible nitrogen this is important

219
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:30,560
because yeast are biota a living

220
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,720
organism and we want them to do our

221
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,160
bidding of converting sugar to alcohol

222
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,919
so we need to provide them with enough

223
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:38,160
nutrients for them to do that when you

224
00:07:35,918 --> 00:07:40,159
have low nitrogen values fermentations

225
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,840
can get stuck and sluggish putting off

226
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:43,280
off aromas and at the end of the day not

227
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:45,119
completing your fermentation so that's

228
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:46,878
why it's an important value to look at

229
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,399
and i also subjected these wines to a

230
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:50,319
sensory analysis

231
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:53,679
looking at differences perceived in wine

232
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:54,800
aroma which i'll also talk about later

233
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:57,038
so to give you an idea of the

234
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,800
abbreviated season we're working with in

235
00:07:57,038 --> 00:08:00,639
may we get bud break this is when

236
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,720
grapevines are dehilled that soil is

237
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:04,478
pushed back down from the roots or from

238
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:06,160
the over the graft union this is also

239
00:08:04,478 --> 00:08:07,359
when i begin to establish my underlying

240
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,199
cover crops

241
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,319
by bloom which occurs in mid-june you

242
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:11,598
can see that's the second picture at the

243
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:14,720
top there we're not pretty like the

244
00:08:11,598 --> 00:08:16,478
apples but it happens nonetheless

245
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:18,160
the cover crops have emerged this is

246
00:08:16,478 --> 00:08:19,918
also typically when growers will start

247
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:21,759
having to manage any kind of excess

248
00:08:19,918 --> 00:08:23,120
vegetative growth they'll start going in

249
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:25,120
and shoot thinning they might adjust

250
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,120
cluster crop that kind of thing

251
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:29,038
this is also when i start looking at

252
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:31,038
the water potential readings

253
00:08:29,038 --> 00:08:32,879
and i start tracking shoot lengths

254
00:08:31,038 --> 00:08:35,120
verizon is a really critical time in our

255
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:36,799
world veraison is the fancy word we have

256
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,560
for when ripening really starts to

257
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:40,879
accelerate this is when sugar starts to

258
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:43,038
rapidly accumulate in the fruit acid

259
00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:44,958
levels start to drop in red varieties

260
00:08:43,038 --> 00:08:46,639
you get the green to red color shift

261
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:49,119
change and in the whites you do get a

262
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:51,199
color shift it goes from those bright

263
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,879
like hard green berries to the skin

264
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:56,080
soften and in recently it turns a nice

265
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:57,360
kind of bright yellow color

266
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:59,200
harvest

267
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:01,680
roughly happened late september to most

268
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:03,360
likely early october this is when all

269
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:05,359
the fruits taken off the vines i take

270
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,519
different yield components i crush the

271
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,720
fruit analyze the juice and the juices

272
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:10,320
then put through fermentation to be

273
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,080
completed wines

274
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:14,480
by november we are healing our

275
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,920
grapevines back up and this is sort of

276
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,600
would be the end date then for my

277
00:09:15,919 --> 00:09:19,599
undervine cover crops because we have a

278
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,519
giant cultivation operation underneath

279
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,360
the vines at this point the vines have

280
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:24,720
pretty much gone dormant and have leaves

281
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:27,680
drop and they're preparing to hibernate

282
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:30,000
in the winter like i wish i was

283
00:09:27,679 --> 00:09:31,759
as i said i do make wine from the juice

284
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,519
this is sort of a standard white wine

285
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:35,120
fermentation procedure

286
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:37,519
that in general was held for both of my

287
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,799
lots what's important to note here is

288
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:41,440
that for each treatment there are

289
00:09:38,799 --> 00:09:43,199
duplicate lots of wine made

290
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:45,519
and the whole idea is since this is a

291
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:47,759
viticultural trial i'm trying to be as

292
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:50,000
hands-off as possible in the enological

293
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:51,439
process and try to allow characteristics

294
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,879
in the vineyard to be carried through so

295
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:55,120
i'm using a yeast that doesn't throw off

296
00:09:52,879 --> 00:09:56,958
a lot of interesting aromas i uh

297
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:59,519
chopalize or add sugar to a standard

298
00:09:56,958 --> 00:10:01,439
sugar level i supplement the yeast or

299
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:03,039
the yam level to make sure

300
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:06,160
these yeast are going to be able to go

301
00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:07,759
and i do ferment these wines to dryness

302
00:10:06,159 --> 00:10:09,679
so for the multi-dimensional sorting

303
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:12,399
analysis by wine aroma the big fancy

304
00:10:09,679 --> 00:10:14,078
word for my sensory tests in short

305
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:15,759
all the duplicate lots were presented to

306
00:10:14,078 --> 00:10:17,759
panelists and they were asked to sort

307
00:10:15,759 --> 00:10:19,600
wines by similarity into groups if you

308
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:21,278
found a wine to be similar

309
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,879
to another wine you put them in the same

310
00:10:21,278 --> 00:10:24,639
group if you found them to be different

311
00:10:22,879 --> 00:10:26,639
you put them in different groups this

312
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:28,399
gets a lot of grouping data data that's

313
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:30,240
then run through sas and can give you a

314
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:32,720
visual representation of the differences

315
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:34,320
which i'll be showing you later so i had

316
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:36,000
two field sites that i did my research

317
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:38,720
on the first was an uh commercial

318
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,360
vineyard on the east side of seneca lake

319
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:43,519
um these vines were older almost 20 year

320
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:45,839
old 20 years old now

321
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:48,000
i planted on a honey oil silt loam

322
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:50,079
riesling and what i want to note here is

323
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,320
it's a scott henry training system

324
00:10:50,078 --> 00:10:54,319
meaning that there is both an upper and

325
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,839
lower fruiting zone

326
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,839
this is important because we'll often do

327
00:10:55,839 --> 00:11:00,240
this in vineyards that have sort of

328
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:01,519
excessive growth but this already has

329
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:04,720
been done at this vineyard and we were

330
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:04,720
still seeing excessive growth

331
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,480
um there were treatments the underlying

332
00:11:07,278 --> 00:11:10,240
cover crops were originally planted in

333
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:12,000
2011 and carried through through this

334
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:13,440
year in a randomized complete block

335
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,360
design with four replicates per

336
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:17,279
treatment

337
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:19,120
my four treatments were as such annual

338
00:11:17,278 --> 00:11:20,799
rye grass planted in the middle of may

339
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,240
this is a later establishing while

340
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:23,759
planted in the middle of may it doesn't

341
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,519
really get going and i noticed the most

342
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:27,360
biomass accumulation much later in the

343
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:29,120
season such as july august and it grows

344
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:31,039
well through october

345
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,919
buckwheat that beautiful white flowering

346
00:11:31,039 --> 00:11:33,759
plant

347
00:11:31,919 --> 00:11:35,759
has seeded in late may interesting about

348
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:37,360
buckwheat is it frost kills so that'd be

349
00:11:35,759 --> 00:11:39,838
ideal for a kind of abbreviated time

350
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:41,360
frame that we're looking for

351
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:42,800
buckwheat also has a lot of notoriety

352
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,959
right now because work out of berkeley

353
00:11:42,799 --> 00:11:47,359
and work by greg globe here has shown

354
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:49,439
that it could potentially increase

355
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:51,440
the incidence of generalist predators in

356
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:53,519
the vineyard and increase rates of

357
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:55,440
parasitism of vineyard pests there's a

358
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:57,120
lot of interest around buckwheat

359
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,079
natural vegetation polite word for

360
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,360
wheats

361
00:11:58,078 --> 00:12:01,120
we allow them to grow throughout the

362
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,800
season whatever may be there and then

363
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,480
our control is the traditional

364
00:12:02,799 --> 00:12:06,159
glyphosate spray

365
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,759
applied one to two times a year the

366
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:09,278
underlying cover crop treatments were

367
00:12:07,759 --> 00:12:11,039
mowed as needed to keep them from

368
00:12:09,278 --> 00:12:12,639
getting too tall into the canopy and

369
00:12:11,039 --> 00:12:13,838
that ended up being one to two times a

370
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:15,839
year

371
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:18,320
my second site is the cornell orchards

372
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:19,680
at lansing in one of the riesling blocks

373
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:22,480
that i kind of inherited from ian

374
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:24,159
merwin's old work

375
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:26,560
here these fines were originally planted

376
00:12:24,159 --> 00:12:28,159
in 2007 it once again is a two-tier flat

377
00:12:26,559 --> 00:12:30,000
bow which is a double canopy fruiting

378
00:12:28,159 --> 00:12:31,519
system and that picture that i used on

379
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,200
the slide about excessive vigor came

380
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:36,879
from this site so i can assure you that

381
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:38,160
there's a lot of excess vigor here

382
00:12:36,879 --> 00:12:40,559
these treatments were originally

383
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:42,159
established in 2012 and carried out this

384
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:43,679
year this site's a little complicated so

385
00:12:42,159 --> 00:12:45,120
i'll do my best to describe it under

386
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:47,519
vine cover crops are planted down the

387
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,959
entire lengths of rows each cover crop

388
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:51,120
was planted down four rows in its

389
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:52,958
entirety there is then an overlay of

390
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:55,200
irrigation at this site that allows me

391
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:57,119
to irrigate half of a given row which

392
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:59,759
half as irrigated alternates down the

393
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:01,679
rows the whole site is in total just

394
00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:02,958
under one acre to put that size into

395
00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:05,679
perspective

396
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:07,518
i just i initiated irrigation

397
00:13:05,679 --> 00:13:09,759
when the average midday leaf stem water

398
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:12,159
potential exceeded minus eight bars this

399
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:14,480
is a rough threshold for when vine water

400
00:13:12,159 --> 00:13:16,078
status tends to be inhibited inhibiting

401
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:18,320
vegetative growth so that's kind of

402
00:13:16,078 --> 00:13:21,278
where that number came from in 2012 we

403
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:22,800
irrigated three times in 2013 it never

404
00:13:21,278 --> 00:13:25,519
actually got that

405
00:13:22,799 --> 00:13:27,039
that dry to need to irrigate so i did

406
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:29,759
analyze it in case there was any kind of

407
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:31,120
a carryover effect with the irrigation

408
00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:33,039
but that was just simply the case this

409
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:35,360
year my three underlying cover crop or

410
00:13:33,039 --> 00:13:37,039
three under vine cover treatments here

411
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:39,199
was the buckwheat which i talked about

412
00:13:37,039 --> 00:13:40,719
the same glyphosate sprayed control but

413
00:13:39,198 --> 00:13:42,000
what i did here was look at chicory

414
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,600
which is sort of a different growth

415
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,159
habit all the rest are pretty much

416
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:47,920
straight annuals chicory is a biannual

417
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:49,919
which often acts as a short-lived

418
00:13:47,919 --> 00:13:51,679
perennial its first year you can see it

419
00:13:49,919 --> 00:13:54,240
had that nice low-growing rosette form

420
00:13:51,679 --> 00:13:55,278
established really nice

421
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,799
this year

422
00:13:55,278 --> 00:13:58,720
even though i reseeded and there was a

423
00:13:56,799 --> 00:14:00,719
complete cultivation operation obviously

424
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:02,720
some survived and it shot up all these

425
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:04,879
not only the low growing rosette form

426
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:06,560
but all those flowering stalks another

427
00:14:04,879 --> 00:14:08,078
note thing to note about the chicory

428
00:14:06,559 --> 00:14:09,518
that makes it sort of different is that

429
00:14:08,078 --> 00:14:11,439
all the rest tend to be relatively

430
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:13,039
shallow rooted cover crops

431
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:14,560
chicory has this nice deep tap root and

432
00:14:13,039 --> 00:14:15,439
these were taken very early in the

433
00:14:14,559 --> 00:14:16,799
season

434
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:19,040
when i was doing soil sampling just a

435
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:20,719
few weeks ago i found chicory roots

436
00:14:19,039 --> 00:14:22,799
going past even 20 centimeters in the

437
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:25,759
soil so it's just looking at a very

438
00:14:22,799 --> 00:14:28,319
different growing habit of a plant

439
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:29,919
so first question did my cover where are

440
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:32,240
my cover crops there why look at this

441
00:14:29,919 --> 00:14:33,439
question if they weren't so yes in short

442
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:36,320
at all three sites the cover crops

443
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:38,000
established 2011 at my first site i had

444
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:39,519
mowed once already so that's why they

445
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,360
have much lower values i think that's an

446
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:42,399
interesting note in case a grower was

447
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,079
ever worried about it going out of

448
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:46,480
control mowing does sufficiently

449
00:14:44,078 --> 00:14:47,838
decrease a lot of the biomass present

450
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,440
in both other years you can see animal

451
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:51,120
rye grass and buckwheat established well

452
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,120
but with a fair amount of weeds

453
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:55,198
and that in all years at all the

454
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,959
both sites the control was essentially

455
00:14:55,198 --> 00:14:58,639
vegetation free

456
00:14:56,958 --> 00:15:00,719
you can see the biannual growth habit of

457
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:02,879
chicory reflected in the biomass with it

458
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:05,199
being relatively low in that first year

459
00:15:02,879 --> 00:15:07,039
but a lot a lot of it was present this

460
00:15:05,198 --> 00:15:08,958
last year and buckwheat was relatively

461
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:10,319
consistent

462
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:12,078
so one of my first measures of

463
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:14,079
vegetative growth was looking at cane

464
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:16,078
diameter this is a bit of a goldilocks

465
00:15:14,078 --> 00:15:17,838
story when we go to prune in the winter

466
00:15:16,078 --> 00:15:19,039
we don't want a cane that's too thick or

467
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:20,639
too thin

468
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:22,240
and the rough

469
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:25,120
ideal that some people argue is about

470
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:26,560
pencil thickness or six millimeters

471
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:28,879
on my first site there were never any

472
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:31,518
significant differences made um on cane

473
00:15:28,879 --> 00:15:33,198
diameter but on my second site in this

474
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:35,198
last year chicory actually did

475
00:15:33,198 --> 00:15:37,519
significantly reduce the cane diameter

476
00:15:35,198 --> 00:15:39,919
down to six millimeters from just around

477
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:41,360
seven compared to the glyphosate control

478
00:15:39,919 --> 00:15:43,039
so it might not be a big difference but

479
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,800
it definitely was a lower value that's

480
00:15:43,039 --> 00:15:46,879
closer to what we would consider more

481
00:15:44,799 --> 00:15:48,399
ideal

482
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:50,000
as i said i tracked shoot lengths and

483
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:51,679
could subsequently calculate shoot

484
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,198
growth rates throughout the season for

485
00:15:51,679 --> 00:15:55,519
my first sight there was never an effect

486
00:15:53,198 --> 00:15:57,439
in 2012 but this last year natural

487
00:15:55,519 --> 00:16:00,320
vegetation actually did have a greater

488
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:02,160
shoot growth rate in the early july time

489
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:04,240
period and at my second site there was

490
00:16:02,159 --> 00:16:06,000
never any significant effect on shoot

491
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:08,159
growth rate by the under vine cover crop

492
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,399
treatments

493
00:16:08,159 --> 00:16:12,078
so this is this epqa i was talking about

494
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:13,759
earlier

495
00:16:12,078 --> 00:16:15,198
at site at the first site the annual

496
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:17,120
ryegrass the buckwheat and the natural

497
00:16:15,198 --> 00:16:19,838
vegetation never affected any of the

498
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:21,679
canopy characteristics uh same goes from

499
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:24,000
the first year at site number two

500
00:16:21,679 --> 00:16:25,439
however in this last year chicory did

501
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,679
significantly affect canopy

502
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:30,240
characteristics it reduced the total

503
00:16:27,679 --> 00:16:32,078
number of leaf layers in the canopy

504
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,519
it reduced the occlusion layer number

505
00:16:32,078 --> 00:16:35,599
which means the number of shade

506
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:37,198
producing layers in the canopy and then

507
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:39,120
not surprisingly if you have fewer shade

508
00:16:37,198 --> 00:16:41,120
producing layers and fewer leaves it

509
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:43,278
actually increased the cluster exposure

510
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:46,078
flux availability which is a big phrase

511
00:16:43,278 --> 00:16:47,838
for the light exposure on clusters

512
00:16:46,078 --> 00:16:50,078
this graph here as you move left to

513
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:53,120
right on the x-axis you're moving from

514
00:16:50,078 --> 00:16:54,958
deeply shaded fruit to highly exposed

515
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:56,399
fruit so in our world we tend to want

516
00:16:54,958 --> 00:16:58,479
more exposed fruit for disease

517
00:16:56,399 --> 00:17:00,159
management purposes

518
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:02,240
you can see that the

519
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:04,558
tall blue bar and the yellow bars are

520
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:06,240
the control treatments and they by far

521
00:17:04,558 --> 00:17:08,078
and large were dominated by deeply

522
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,519
shaded fruit whereas when you come and

523
00:17:08,078 --> 00:17:10,798
look over here at the more exposed

524
00:17:09,519 --> 00:17:12,720
regions it was the two trickery

525
00:17:10,798 --> 00:17:14,400
treatments that had much more exposed

526
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:17,199
fruit and the buckwheat was yet again

527
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,199
intermediate

528
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:21,359
uh we take pre we pro when we prune in

529
00:17:19,519 --> 00:17:23,918
the winter we'll calculate all that

530
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:26,558
growth um from the last season

531
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:28,000
and way um in the first site there was

532
00:17:26,558 --> 00:17:31,279
no significant difference among pruning

533
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,720
treatments in 2011 and 2012 2013 data

534
00:17:31,279 --> 00:17:34,879
will be coming

535
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:36,400
but i don't have it for you yet

536
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,600
and then at my second site what's

537
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,600
interesting here is that there was

538
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:41,918
actually a significant cover crop by

539
00:17:39,599 --> 00:17:44,558
irrigation interaction effect

540
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:46,640
where the irrigated control yielded a

541
00:17:44,558 --> 00:17:48,639
significantly higher pruning weight than

542
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:50,160
the non-irrigated buckwheat but that's

543
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:52,640
the only definitive relation that really

544
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:54,400
came out in that

545
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:55,840
so pre-dawn water potential which at

546
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,919
this point i think almost everyone in

547
00:17:55,839 --> 00:17:59,199
this room has heard me complain about

548
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:01,038
is when

549
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,480
i go out to the vineyard at 3 30 in the

550
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:04,879
morning because there is no

551
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:07,038
transpiration on the plants and this is

552
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:09,200
when the vine water status will have

553
00:18:07,038 --> 00:18:10,480
equilibrated the soil moisture

554
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,240
and so i'm getting a rough measure on

555
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:13,599
soil moisture where the rooting zone

556
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:15,279
grape roots are

557
00:18:13,599 --> 00:18:17,678
in 2012 there were no differences in

558
00:18:15,279 --> 00:18:20,000
2013 there was one significant

559
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:21,600
difference at my first sight

560
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,440
it actually did happen

561
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:25,599
the control was

562
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:26,798
significantly slightly less water

563
00:18:25,599 --> 00:18:28,319
stressed

564
00:18:26,798 --> 00:18:30,240
the more negative the value the more

565
00:18:28,319 --> 00:18:32,558
water stress but i would just like to

566
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:34,960
point that negative

567
00:18:32,558 --> 00:18:37,038
one and a quarter bars to negative half

568
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:39,200
a bar is hardly what we would call water

569
00:18:37,038 --> 00:18:41,119
stressed as i said minus eight was the

570
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:42,720
limit that we began to see an inhibition

571
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:46,159
of vegetative growth so these are just

572
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:47,679
essentially very well hydrated vines

573
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:49,360
uh same goes for site number two there

574
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:52,000
were never any significant differences

575
00:18:49,359 --> 00:18:54,079
in this predawn water potential

576
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,599
so going from the least amount of stress

577
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:57,519
to the most amount of stress of vine is

578
00:18:55,599 --> 00:18:59,439
seeing midday stem water potentials are

579
00:18:57,519 --> 00:19:01,519
taken at solar noon and kind of looking

580
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:03,519
at the maximum potential water stress

581
00:19:01,519 --> 00:19:05,200
for site number one there was never any

582
00:19:03,519 --> 00:19:07,119
significant differences in the midday

583
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:08,798
stem water potential among the cover

584
00:19:07,119 --> 00:19:10,879
crop treatments

585
00:19:08,798 --> 00:19:12,319
for site number two there was never any

586
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:14,320
significant difference in the midday

587
00:19:12,319 --> 00:19:15,759
stem water potentials among treatment

588
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:18,558
those black arrows indicate when

589
00:19:15,759 --> 00:19:20,879
irrigation was initiated in 2012 and as

590
00:19:18,558 --> 00:19:22,960
you can see by the graph uh 2013 was

591
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:24,799
just a much wetter year we just never

592
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:26,400
received those that level of water

593
00:19:24,798 --> 00:19:28,000
stress those vines were very well

594
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,519
hydrated

595
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,919
even with the presence of an under vine

596
00:19:29,519 --> 00:19:34,319
cover crop

597
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:35,679
so to look at see if there's a potential

598
00:19:34,319 --> 00:19:37,359
nutrient effect of having these

599
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:39,679
underlying cover crops right there in

600
00:19:37,359 --> 00:19:42,319
the rooting zone of the vine

601
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:44,880
we took petial tissue at verizon sampled

602
00:19:42,319 --> 00:19:47,200
and submitted for analysis uh 2013 data

603
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:48,799
is still pending but uh this is the data

604
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:50,400
from 2012.

605
00:19:48,798 --> 00:19:52,400
the overall story here is that there is

606
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:54,720
no overall story there was no consistent

607
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:56,880
effect that i could find interestingly

608
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:58,558
annual ryegrass actually increased the

609
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:00,559
levels of phosphorus compared to the

610
00:19:58,558 --> 00:20:02,000
herbicide control and increased levels

611
00:20:00,558 --> 00:20:03,759
of iron

612
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,839
at the second site there was there was

613
00:20:03,759 --> 00:20:08,240
no effect on any of the nutrients except

614
00:20:05,839 --> 00:20:10,480
for nitrogen and you can see yet again

615
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:12,960
there was this interaction effect where

616
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:15,200
the irrigated control had significantly

617
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:17,679
more nitrogen than both the buckwheat

618
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,679
treatments

619
00:20:18,798 --> 00:20:23,359
so at harvest we look at different

620
00:20:21,038 --> 00:20:25,279
measures of yield i look at the total

621
00:20:23,359 --> 00:20:26,319
number of clusters per vine so a lot of

622
00:20:25,279 --> 00:20:28,000
counting

623
00:20:26,319 --> 00:20:30,000
and then we weigh these total clusters

624
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,000
on a pervine base basis to get a yield

625
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,640
per vine you can then calculate an

626
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,798
average weight per individual cluster

627
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:38,559
and then from that from those clusters i

628
00:20:36,798 --> 00:20:40,558
take individual berries and weigh them

629
00:20:38,558 --> 00:20:42,240
out so i can get an average weight per

630
00:20:40,558 --> 00:20:43,918
berry and then from that you can

631
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:45,440
calculate on average how many berries

632
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:46,960
there were per cluster

633
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,798
so for my site number one there was

634
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:50,960
never a terribly consistent effect

635
00:20:48,798 --> 00:20:53,200
except for that annual rye grass

636
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:55,840
did influence the number of berries per

637
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,880
cluster having significantly fewer

638
00:20:55,839 --> 00:20:59,279
same with the cluster weight was

639
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:00,799
slightly smaller but significantly so

640
00:20:59,279 --> 00:21:02,399
then actually the buckwheat treatment

641
00:21:00,798 --> 00:21:05,038
and the buckwheat treatment

642
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:06,320
but no terribly consistent effect i'll

643
00:21:05,038 --> 00:21:09,200
take a moment here to explain what the

644
00:21:06,319 --> 00:21:11,519
rivas index is too that's a very common

645
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:13,360
measure in the grape and wine community

646
00:21:11,519 --> 00:21:15,599
to help evaluate the ratio of

647
00:21:13,359 --> 00:21:17,839
reproductive to vegetative growth what

648
00:21:15,599 --> 00:21:19,759
we do is on a pervine basis take the

649
00:21:17,839 --> 00:21:22,158
total yield and fruit like how much that

650
00:21:19,759 --> 00:21:23,440
fruit weight in kilograms divided by the

651
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:25,440
pruning weight we harvest that

652
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:26,960
subsequent winter from the vine and

653
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:29,038
kilograms so essentially ends up as

654
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:31,759
kilograms or kilograms or a unitless

655
00:21:29,038 --> 00:21:33,919
ratio and what exactly the ideal ratio

656
00:21:31,759 --> 00:21:35,839
is that's a wonderfully debated subject

657
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:37,360
roughly ten some people say anywhere

658
00:21:35,839 --> 00:21:39,359
between four to ten some people say ten

659
00:21:37,359 --> 00:21:42,079
to twelve but you can see here there was

660
00:21:39,359 --> 00:21:42,839
no significant effect on this ratio at

661
00:21:42,079 --> 00:21:46,480
this

662
00:21:42,839 --> 00:21:47,678
site so that's arg is annual

663
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:49,919
correct

664
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:52,080
annual ryegrass buckwheat control for

665
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:53,679
the glyphosate and nat nat short for

666
00:21:52,079 --> 00:21:55,359
natural vegetation

667
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:57,200
so you're seeing it

668
00:21:55,359 --> 00:21:58,798
so yeah i did see fewer berries per

669
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:01,120
cluster and in one year i saw a reduced

670
00:21:58,798 --> 00:22:03,359
cluster weight

671
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:04,479
for site number two in 2012 there were

672
00:22:03,359 --> 00:22:06,399
no differences in any of these

673
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:08,240
components but in 23

674
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:10,320
chicory head did have a pretty

675
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:11,759
consistent effect so while the total

676
00:22:10,319 --> 00:22:13,839
number of clusters per vine was not

677
00:22:11,759 --> 00:22:15,440
affected the yield per fine was

678
00:22:13,839 --> 00:22:17,199
significantly reduced with chicory

679
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:18,720
present under the vines so if you do

680
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:20,640
that math it's not too surprising to

681
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:22,319
figure out that the cluster weight the

682
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:24,000
individual clusters weighed less when

683
00:22:22,319 --> 00:22:25,759
the chicory was present

684
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,759
subsequently also the berries were

685
00:22:25,759 --> 00:22:29,359
smaller for the chicory treatment and

686
00:22:27,759 --> 00:22:31,919
the total number of berries per cluster

687
00:22:29,359 --> 00:22:33,759
were smaller and i will get back to you

688
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:36,159
on if there was any difference in 2012

689
00:22:33,759 --> 00:22:38,879
for the rivas index but there wasn't for

690
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:41,280
2012.

691
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:42,960
so uh this fruit is then crushed into

692
00:22:41,279 --> 00:22:44,399
juice and analyzed

693
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:46,240
for site number one

694
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:48,000
the annual rye grass buckwheat and

695
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:49,919
natural vegetation compared to the

696
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,599
glyphosate spray control had no

697
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:53,919
significant differences on the bricks so

698
00:22:51,599 --> 00:22:56,000
the sugar content our tatratable acidity

699
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:57,360
the ph or the yeast dissimible nitrogen

700
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,279
of the juice

701
00:22:57,359 --> 00:23:01,359
for site number two

702
00:22:59,279 --> 00:23:02,720
for 2012

703
00:23:01,359 --> 00:23:04,399
what was interesting is at the beginning

704
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:06,798
of the season the buckwheat actually had

705
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:09,360
a significantly lower acid level

706
00:23:06,798 --> 00:23:11,119
a lower titratable acidity than the

707
00:23:09,359 --> 00:23:13,119
glyphosate control but by the end of the

708
00:23:11,119 --> 00:23:15,279
season at harvest it was actually the

709
00:23:13,119 --> 00:23:18,079
chicory that was had a significantly

710
00:23:15,279 --> 00:23:20,000
reduced titratable acidity by just under

711
00:23:18,079 --> 00:23:22,240
one gram per liter

712
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:26,720
there was never any cover crop effect

713
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:26,720
for on the sugar the ph or the yan

714
00:23:27,038 --> 00:23:31,359
so the wine aroma sensory as i said once

715
00:23:29,759 --> 00:23:33,679
you do all this grouping data you get a

716
00:23:31,359 --> 00:23:36,639
visual representation of how people

717
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:38,480
found the wines to be similar by roma so

718
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:40,880
the closer two points are together on

719
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:42,480
these graphs indicate

720
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,840
the more similar by aroma they were

721
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:46,000
found to be

722
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:47,199
in 2012 you can see that while buckwheat

723
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,880
and natural

724
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:50,558
vegetation were found to yield more

725
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:52,799
similarly

726
00:23:50,558 --> 00:23:54,158
aromatic wines they were all all the

727
00:23:52,798 --> 00:23:56,400
undervine treatments were found to be

728
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:58,240
different by aroma than control and in

729
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:00,000
2012 that same trend kind of continued

730
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:01,519
with the buckwheat and natural being

731
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,839
found to be pretty damn different than

732
00:24:01,519 --> 00:24:06,558
the control by

733
00:24:02,839 --> 00:24:08,798
aroma so for my second site um here i'll

734
00:24:06,558 --> 00:24:10,000
note that actually at the previous site

735
00:24:08,798 --> 00:24:11,599
there were eight wines presented to

736
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,440
panelists like i said duplicate lots of

737
00:24:11,599 --> 00:24:15,439
wines there were four treatments so

738
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:17,038
eight wines were presented for this site

739
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:19,120
there were 12 wines presented because i

740
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:21,038
have six treatments buckwheat buckwheat

741
00:24:19,119 --> 00:24:22,479
irrigated and non-irrigated chicory

742
00:24:21,038 --> 00:24:24,720
irrigated and non-irrigated and my

743
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:27,200
control irrigated and non-irrigated

744
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:28,880
um 53 panelists participated so thank

745
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:30,798
you and then you were asked to sort them

746
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:32,400
between one and six groups

747
00:24:30,798 --> 00:24:34,720
i don't know if i could have created a

748
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:36,320
more equidistant point graph than what

749
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:37,200
the numbers gave me

750
00:24:36,319 --> 00:24:38,639
um

751
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:40,720
but that was what happened there's

752
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:42,559
potentially a trend here with uh the

753
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:44,240
control and buckwheat non-irrigated at

754
00:24:42,558 --> 00:24:45,839
the bottom being kind of similar in a

755
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:47,919
group typically you want to analyze

756
00:24:45,839 --> 00:24:49,839
these graphs by groupings but it's a

757
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:51,679
little rough here and similarly the

758
00:24:49,839 --> 00:24:53,359
control irrigated and chicory irrigated

759
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:54,960
potentially but overall what is

760
00:24:53,359 --> 00:24:56,639
interesting to note is that these wines

761
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:58,960
were found to be different

762
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:01,038
aromatically and that the irrigation and

763
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:03,038
cover crops were the things that made

764
00:25:01,038 --> 00:25:04,640
them different

765
00:25:03,038 --> 00:25:06,798
so at the end of the day

766
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:08,400
what can i say

767
00:25:06,798 --> 00:25:09,759
it's important to note that these

768
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,519
underlying cover crops did yield

769
00:25:09,759 --> 00:25:13,679
significantly different amounts of above

770
00:25:11,519 --> 00:25:14,879
ground biomass this is important if

771
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:16,159
you're looking to

772
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:18,000
adopt this as part of your vineyard

773
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:19,520
floor management system understanding

774
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,319
that these cover crops are establishing

775
00:25:19,519 --> 00:25:24,960
different depending on species

776
00:25:22,319 --> 00:25:26,879
overall underlying cover crops did not

777
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:28,798
significantly impact measures of vine

778
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:31,039
vegetative growth the two exceptions

779
00:25:28,798 --> 00:25:32,798
being that in this last year natural

780
00:25:31,038 --> 00:25:34,798
vegetation essentially doubled the shoot

781
00:25:32,798 --> 00:25:36,319
growth rate at one point in the season

782
00:25:34,798 --> 00:25:38,639
and that chicory

783
00:25:36,319 --> 00:25:40,480
in its second year of establishment

784
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:42,400
reduced cane diameter and the number of

785
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:45,440
leaf layers in the canopy which resulted

786
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:47,600
in greater cluster exposure to light

787
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:50,320
underlying cover crops were not found to

788
00:25:47,599 --> 00:25:52,558
significantly affect pre-dawn or midday

789
00:25:50,319 --> 00:25:54,720
stem water potentials and similarly

790
00:25:52,558 --> 00:25:56,639
there was no consistent effect on the

791
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:58,640
petiole nutrient content taken at

792
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:00,559
verizon these points are important to

793
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:02,159
note because the whole premise of why

794
00:26:00,558 --> 00:26:04,960
growers are spending a lot of money and

795
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:07,200
a lot of time to keep a vegetation free

796
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:09,360
zone under vines is they fear there will

797
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:11,440
be some kind of water or nutrient effect

798
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:13,359
on the vines which my work has at least

799
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:15,679
preliminarily shown and confirmed with

800
00:26:13,359 --> 00:26:18,798
pass work that this just isn't the case

801
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:18,798
at least in this region

802
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:24,239
under vine cover crops on the whole were

803
00:26:21,599 --> 00:26:26,000
not found to also impact harvest yield

804
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:27,679
this is important if a grower especially

805
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,400
a lot of growers here

806
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:30,559
are

807
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:32,320
not making tons of money their costs of

808
00:26:30,558 --> 00:26:34,558
management are quite expensive for any

809
00:26:32,319 --> 00:26:36,079
of the viniferas including riesling so

810
00:26:34,558 --> 00:26:38,158
they cannot take a hit and yield

811
00:26:36,079 --> 00:26:39,599
potentially so this is important to note

812
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:42,080
that for most of the species tested

813
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:43,439
there were no impacts the one big major

814
00:26:42,079 --> 00:26:44,879
exception being that chicory in its

815
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:47,600
second year of establishment

816
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:50,240
significantly reduced vine

817
00:26:47,599 --> 00:26:51,918
yield and cluster size by 25 percent

818
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:54,480
that the berries per cluster and berry

819
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:55,600
mass was reduced by 14 percent

820
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:57,440
um

821
00:26:55,599 --> 00:26:58,480
i will interestingly note though that i

822
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,840
am not in the

823
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:02,159
viticulture is not the business of

824
00:26:59,839 --> 00:27:04,000
optimizing yield we're in the business

825
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:07,679
of optimizing whatever the winemaker

826
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:10,640
perceives as the wine quality and

827
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:12,480
there is often a notion that too much

828
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:14,559
yield will have detriment to wine

829
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:16,960
quality so currently many vineyard

830
00:27:14,558 --> 00:27:20,079
managers pay lots of money to have crews

831
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:22,079
go through and drop crop

832
00:27:20,079 --> 00:27:23,599
so this reduced yield actually may not

833
00:27:22,079 --> 00:27:25,519
be quite the deal breaker most people

834
00:27:23,599 --> 00:27:27,119
are thinking of in our industry that

835
00:27:25,519 --> 00:27:28,639
could actually be saving you a pass in

836
00:27:27,119 --> 00:27:29,839
the vineyard with your crew

837
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:32,399
similarly

838
00:27:29,839 --> 00:27:34,319
some people do prefer smaller berry size

839
00:27:32,398 --> 00:27:35,519
so this reduced berry mass could be

840
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:38,158
beneficial if that's what you were

841
00:27:35,519 --> 00:27:39,839
looking to achieve in your vineyard

842
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:41,520
overall undervine cover crops were not

843
00:27:39,839 --> 00:27:43,038
impacting your juice composition with

844
00:27:41,519 --> 00:27:45,038
the exception being that chicory at

845
00:27:43,038 --> 00:27:46,960
harvest did reduce titratable acidity by

846
00:27:45,038 --> 00:27:48,480
one gram per liter if you're happy with

847
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:49,759
your juice characteristics then hey it

848
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:51,120
looks like undervine cover crops

849
00:27:49,759 --> 00:27:53,759
probably won't mess with that except for

850
00:27:51,119 --> 00:27:55,759
maybe chicory um here too i would argue

851
00:27:53,759 --> 00:27:57,359
that a one gram per liter reduction

852
00:27:55,759 --> 00:27:58,960
could be beneficial i don't know if

853
00:27:57,359 --> 00:28:00,719
anyone here has tasted our wonderful

854
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:02,720
finger lakes riesling but sometimes they

855
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:04,480
can be a little acidic

856
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:05,440
dropping this by one gram per liter

857
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:07,120
could

858
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:09,519
be desirable to certain wine makers

859
00:28:07,119 --> 00:28:09,519
goals

860
00:28:09,599 --> 00:28:14,639
for a few of my data measures including

861
00:28:11,839 --> 00:28:16,558
the pruning weights and pedial nitrogen

862
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:18,399
there was a significant cover crop by

863
00:28:16,558 --> 00:28:20,240
irrigation interaction

864
00:28:18,398 --> 00:28:21,678
this is sort of interesting to note

865
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:23,120
because it's indicating that these

866
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:25,440
underlying cover crops could have

867
00:28:23,119 --> 00:28:26,959
varying effect in different soil

868
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:29,440
moisture conditions

869
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:31,600
so understanding your specific site and

870
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:32,798
any variability in your site could be

871
00:28:31,599 --> 00:28:34,079
really critical if you're looking to

872
00:28:32,798 --> 00:28:35,918
adapt this to your vineyard floor

873
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:38,158
management plants

874
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:40,720
and the one consistent effect that we

875
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:42,240
saw year after year was that wine aroma

876
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:45,839
was impacted by the presence of

877
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:48,079
underlying cover crops in all years

878
00:28:45,839 --> 00:28:49,839
why since i just talked about a lot of

879
00:28:48,079 --> 00:28:52,158
how my data was not significantly

880
00:28:49,839 --> 00:28:55,038
impacting measures of vine growth or

881
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:57,120
water status or nutrient content

882
00:28:55,038 --> 00:28:58,398
i have a few theories on this so bear

883
00:28:57,119 --> 00:29:00,959
with me

884
00:28:58,398 --> 00:29:02,959
that epqa measurement i took

885
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:04,960
that evaluated the canopy characteristic

886
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:07,519
and light penetration the canopy i took

887
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:09,600
once at verizon similarly i took

888
00:29:07,519 --> 00:29:13,519
nutrient status of the vine via petiole

889
00:29:09,599 --> 00:29:14,798
tissue sampling once at verizon

890
00:29:13,519 --> 00:29:16,960
it is known

891
00:29:14,798 --> 00:29:18,879
from work out of our lab misha who just

892
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:20,640
graduated with a phd

893
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:22,799
from gavin sachs in food science he did

894
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:24,240
work with justine that showed the timing

895
00:29:22,798 --> 00:29:26,000
of cluster light exposure can

896
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:28,720
dramatically affect concentrations of

897
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,960
tdn tdn is that very characteristic

898
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:32,480
petrol gasoline aroma that riesling is

899
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:34,558
sort of famous for

900
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:36,798
um so that not only did the

901
00:29:34,558 --> 00:29:38,398
timing cluster light exposure impact

902
00:29:36,798 --> 00:29:40,639
these important aroma precursors and

903
00:29:38,398 --> 00:29:42,959
riesling but the overall cluster light

904
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:44,720
exposure uh jim meyer

905
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:46,399
myers from our lab just put out a paper

906
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:48,558
showing that very important aroma

907
00:29:46,398 --> 00:29:50,639
precursors in the fruit that create a

908
00:29:48,558 --> 00:29:52,720
lot of characteristic riesling aromas

909
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:55,200
are impacted by the quantity of cluster

910
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:57,200
light exposure so i only looked at this

911
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:58,640
diff at this potentially

912
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,679
different um

913
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:01,120
these differences in cluster lights

914
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:03,600
which are at one point the season at

915
00:30:01,119 --> 00:30:05,119
verizon if there were differences

916
00:30:03,599 --> 00:30:06,398
earlier in the season or later in the

917
00:30:05,119 --> 00:30:07,918
season they could have had dramatic

918
00:30:06,398 --> 00:30:10,319
effects on aroma precursors and i was

919
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:12,240
simply unable to detect them so my same

920
00:30:10,319 --> 00:30:14,240
idea with nutritional differences

921
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:15,919
if there were a nutritional difference

922
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:17,759
early in the season or much later in the

923
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:19,200
season than verizon that was affecting

924
00:30:17,759 --> 00:30:20,879
the biosynthesis of these aroma

925
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:22,720
precursors in the grapes

926
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:24,159
i wouldn't have been able to detect it

927
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:25,360
so those are sort of our biggest

928
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:27,520
theories especially when it comes to

929
00:30:25,359 --> 00:30:29,599
cluster light exposure

930
00:30:27,519 --> 00:30:31,278
but another thing not to rule out is

931
00:30:29,599 --> 00:30:32,798
that green volatiles

932
00:30:31,278 --> 00:30:34,798
could be impacting wine aroma i am

933
00:30:32,798 --> 00:30:36,558
introducing a lot of vegetation directly

934
00:30:34,798 --> 00:30:38,639
underneath the vine some very

935
00:30:36,558 --> 00:30:40,798
preliminary work from justine and dr

936
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:42,720
gavin sachs has shown that hedging

937
00:30:40,798 --> 00:30:44,079
materials directly under the vines can

938
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:46,319
impact

939
00:30:44,079 --> 00:30:47,918
certain characteristics of wine so

940
00:30:46,319 --> 00:30:49,678
kind of taking the next step further too

941
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:51,919
we also know that decomposing plant

942
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:53,278
tissues do give off green volatiles and

943
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:54,799
like i said i've introduced a lot of it

944
00:30:53,278 --> 00:30:58,319
into the vineyard so there is that

945
00:30:54,798 --> 00:31:00,480
potential interaction going on

946
00:30:58,319 --> 00:31:02,720
so where do i go from here i've spent

947
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:04,000
three growing seasons studying this

948
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:05,759
well i've actually just received the

949
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,679
northeast uh sar

950
00:31:05,759 --> 00:31:09,519
graduate student grant to continue my

951
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:11,200
work at my second field site the site at

952
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:13,679
lansing looking at if there's a

953
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:15,679
potential more long-term four-plus years

954
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:17,120
of effect of underlying cover crop

955
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:18,480
establishment

956
00:31:17,119 --> 00:31:20,639
so i'm excited to be able to continue

957
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:21,919
that work there similarly since we do

958
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:23,278
know that these wine aromas were

959
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:25,440
perceived as very different when

960
00:31:23,278 --> 00:31:27,759
underlying cover crops were present um

961
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:29,200
doing the more chemical side of things

962
00:31:27,759 --> 00:31:30,839
looking at potential compounds that

963
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:33,278
could be responsible for these

964
00:31:30,839 --> 00:31:35,199
differences further

965
00:31:33,278 --> 00:31:36,720
preference testing so all i can tell you

966
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:38,798
from those graphs is that the wines were

967
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:41,120
different i can't tell you if that was a

968
00:31:38,798 --> 00:31:43,359
good or bad thing so preference testing

969
00:31:41,119 --> 00:31:44,798
would allow me to better analyze that

970
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:47,119
and understand potential consumer

971
00:31:44,798 --> 00:31:49,519
reactions of being sold wine that was

972
00:31:47,119 --> 00:31:51,119
grown without herbicide

973
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:53,919
similarly we're still sort of on the

974
00:31:51,119 --> 00:31:55,918
search for the holy grail of cover crops

975
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:58,480
uh chicory's showing some promise but an

976
00:31:55,919 --> 00:32:00,000
undervine cover crop that could come

977
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:01,519
that could compete on a level to

978
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,278
actually see this reduction in

979
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:05,679
vegetative growth would still continue

980
00:32:03,278 --> 00:32:08,319
to be a goal um since we do still have

981
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:10,000
this excessively vegetative growth habit

982
00:32:08,319 --> 00:32:11,359
in the finger lakes and lastly

983
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,880
understanding how your vineyard floor

984
00:32:11,359 --> 00:32:15,038
management decisions including using

985
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:16,799
herbicide compared to an underlying

986
00:32:15,038 --> 00:32:19,119
cover crop are affecting the iota of

987
00:32:16,798 --> 00:32:21,918
your entire agro ecosystem could be

988
00:32:19,119 --> 00:32:23,038
something that would be very interesting

989
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:25,038
these are works

990
00:32:23,038 --> 00:32:27,119
cited we all in science stand on the

991
00:32:25,038 --> 00:32:29,200
shoulders of the giants before us

992
00:32:27,119 --> 00:32:31,359
um at this time there's so many people

993
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:32,720
i'd like to thank um i especially want

994
00:32:31,359 --> 00:32:34,240
to thank eric and the cornell orchards

995
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:35,839
crew and john wagner out at wagner

996
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:37,200
vineyards for allowing a graduate

997
00:32:35,839 --> 00:32:38,558
student to run amok in their vineyards

998
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:40,399
and making their life i know more

999
00:32:38,558 --> 00:32:41,519
difficult but uh without their hard work

1000
00:32:40,398 --> 00:32:42,558
i wouldn't have been able to do any of

1001
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:44,000
this work

1002
00:32:42,558 --> 00:32:45,678
i want to especially take a moment to

1003
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,440
thank the cornell drearer committee

1004
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:49,440
because i am the fortunate recipient of

1005
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:51,278
the frederick drear award this year and

1006
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:53,120
i'm basically counting the days till i

1007
00:32:51,278 --> 00:32:54,798
will be leaving for marlboro where i

1008
00:32:53,119 --> 00:32:56,959
will be going off to savion blanc

1009
00:32:54,798 --> 00:32:58,240
country for quite a while where of all

1010
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:00,240
things i'll be doing some undervine

1011
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:02,798
cover crop research

1012
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:04,720
and i've also accepted um

1013
00:33:02,798 --> 00:33:05,759
a lab tech position with individual wine

1014
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:08,480
company

1015
00:33:05,759 --> 00:33:11,119
to work the 2014 harvest over there but

1016
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:13,278
never fear i'll be back

1017
00:33:11,119 --> 00:33:15,599
um i've just i've accepted uh continuing

1018
00:33:13,278 --> 00:33:17,278
on for my phd working here with justine

1019
00:33:15,599 --> 00:33:19,759
to stop or to continue on with some of

1020
00:33:17,278 --> 00:33:21,519
the work that um i've done here and

1021
00:33:19,759 --> 00:33:23,359
presented to you today to you for my

1022
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:24,720
master's at this time i'd be happy to

1023
00:33:23,359 --> 00:33:27,519
take any questions and thank you

1024
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:27,519
everyone for listening

1025
00:33:33,119 --> 00:33:36,798
uh definitely so the question was in

1026
00:33:35,038 --> 00:33:38,879
relation to the fact that uh the annual

1027
00:33:36,798 --> 00:33:41,519
rye grass treatment exhibited higher

1028
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:44,480
levels of phosphorus and um iron and had

1029
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:44,480
had certain yield effects

1030
00:33:44,558 --> 00:33:48,558
well yes it was it was not a predominant

1031
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:50,399
effect the number of berries per cluster

1032
00:33:48,558 --> 00:33:52,960
was significant but not on a level that

1033
00:33:50,398 --> 00:33:54,079
would uh i would have been shot from the

1034
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:55,360
rooftops

1035
00:33:54,079 --> 00:33:57,038
and it wasn't consistently it was only

1036
00:33:55,359 --> 00:33:58,558
the one year that we saw a reduction in

1037
00:33:57,038 --> 00:33:59,440
cluster size so

1038
00:33:58,558 --> 00:34:00,798
um

1039
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:02,399
my sort of response is that yes we

1040
00:34:00,798 --> 00:34:03,839
certainly think the soil microbiota and

1041
00:34:02,398 --> 00:34:05,678
all that could be dramatically affecting

1042
00:34:03,839 --> 00:34:08,000
it the soil side of the undervine cover

1043
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:10,159
crops is more the project of um it was

1044
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:12,159
becky ciriani and adam carl in our lab

1045
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:14,159
has taken over and looking a lot at that

1046
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:15,440
and that's sort of it but definitely

1047
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:17,039
it's something to consider i think

1048
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:18,720
what's unique in this situation that

1049
00:34:17,039 --> 00:34:20,800
could be dramatically affecting the soil

1050
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:22,719
biota is the fact that we have hilling

1051
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:24,240
up so we're essentially doing a giant

1052
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:26,398
mulching of these

1053
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:28,959
decomposing or cover crops into the soil

1054
00:34:26,398 --> 00:34:30,638
every winter and then we're mixing it

1055
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:31,838
all up again in the spring so i think

1056
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:33,280
that's potentially where you're getting

1057
00:34:31,838 --> 00:34:35,199
some of these interesting effects and

1058
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:36,879
how these plants are decomposing too

1059
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:38,319
could have some dramatic effects so

1060
00:34:36,878 --> 00:34:39,440
certainly it's of something of interest

1061
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:41,599
and yeah those results were a little

1062
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:43,039
surprising and i'm still waiting to get

1063
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:44,800
results back from our cornell nutrient

1064
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:46,398
lab and when i get those i'll be able to

1065
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:49,440
further see if this is a consistent

1066
00:34:46,398 --> 00:34:50,638
year-to-year effect

1067
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:52,000
the questions about training of the

1068
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:54,320
sensory individuals in short they

1069
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,918
weren't so for this sort of study you do

1070
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:58,240
not want trained individuals they are

1071
00:34:55,918 --> 00:35:00,480
given an explicit set of instructions

1072
00:34:58,239 --> 00:35:01,519
they are allowed to ask me questions and

1073
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:03,280
i can

1074
00:35:01,519 --> 00:35:05,440
expound on the procedure but the idea is

1075
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:07,359
that i am looking for

1076
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:08,960
a just normal white wine consumer the

1077
00:35:07,358 --> 00:35:10,639
one limitation was that on average you

1078
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:12,400
drink white wine about once a month i

1079
00:35:10,639 --> 00:35:15,039
was looking for wine drinkers not just

1080
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:16,720
anybody but um we weren't this wasn't

1081
00:35:15,039 --> 00:35:18,239
what was what you might be thinking of

1082
00:35:16,719 --> 00:35:20,719
which is called a descriptive analysis

1083
00:35:18,239 --> 00:35:22,479
panel where you have explicit training

1084
00:35:20,719 --> 00:35:24,799
on the different characteristics um

1085
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:26,400
you'll have training on what you think

1086
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:28,160
the characteristics are in this type of

1087
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:31,039
wine and then subsequently the standards

1088
00:35:28,159 --> 00:35:33,838
of lemon flavor or standards of

1089
00:35:31,039 --> 00:35:36,000
acid flavor and those sorts of things

1090
00:35:33,838 --> 00:35:38,159
this was sort of not supposed to be that

1091
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:40,079
this is about your own perception of the

1092
00:35:38,159 --> 00:35:41,598
aroma i'm not looking to identify aromas

1093
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:44,720
so however you perceive them to be

1094
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:46,160
different you group them accordingly

1095
00:35:44,719 --> 00:35:47,439
so the question is is there a tendency

1096
00:35:46,159 --> 00:35:48,960
in difference testing to find more

1097
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:50,240
differences that may exist that's always

1098
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:51,838
the risk when you're asking someone to

1099
00:35:50,239 --> 00:35:52,719
find differences they can be prone to

1100
00:35:51,838 --> 00:35:55,358
that

1101
00:35:52,719 --> 00:35:56,719
this is a little more i would say

1102
00:35:55,358 --> 00:35:58,159
they are presented with the option of

1103
00:35:56,719 --> 00:35:59,759
putting them all in one group which

1104
00:35:58,159 --> 00:36:01,118
people did

1105
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:03,520
if they found that there were no

1106
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:04,640
differences so while it is always a

1107
00:36:03,519 --> 00:36:06,000
problem there's always a problem like

1108
00:36:04,639 --> 00:36:07,358
that i think with almost any sensory

1109
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,880
test you do there's going to be some

1110
00:36:07,358 --> 00:36:10,559
bias that way so i think this test was

1111
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:12,079
pretty representative of being able to

1112
00:36:10,559 --> 00:36:13,358
determine differences but like i said at

1113
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:14,560
the end of the day all i can say is

1114
00:36:13,358 --> 00:36:17,358
differences i can't tell if they were

1115
00:36:14,559 --> 00:36:18,320
preferred or not or while relatively

1116
00:36:17,358 --> 00:36:19,920
they might have been different from each

1117
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,880
other but if overall compared to all the

1118
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:22,320
whites the world they weren't that

1119
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:23,920
different i can't say that because i

1120
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:26,640
didn't have any other externally tested

1121
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:28,320
lines so there's a balance that way so i

1122
00:36:26,639 --> 00:36:30,159
haven't so the questions about

1123
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:31,680
mycorrhizal biomass in where i'm having

1124
00:36:30,159 --> 00:36:33,920
these cover crops potentially a nutrient

1125
00:36:31,679 --> 00:36:36,000
effect um i have not looked at that in

1126
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:37,920
any kind of scientific form for me to

1127
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:40,880
actually say

1128
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:42,480
there was a difference or anything um

1129
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:43,838
doing quick research on these cover

1130
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:45,280
crops there is that potential especially

1131
00:36:43,838 --> 00:36:47,920
like with chicory i definitely know just

1132
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:49,119
doing my soil samples i saw them but um

1133
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:50,800
and i'm still waiting to get some of the

1134
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:52,838
back and research potentially back this

1135
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:55,200
year about the chicory but

1136
00:36:52,838 --> 00:36:56,639
um in short i just don't know that's on

1137
00:36:55,199 --> 00:36:58,078
the soil side of things and that's

1138
00:36:56,639 --> 00:36:59,519
definitely a direction that would be

1139
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:00,880
very interesting

1140
00:36:59,519 --> 00:37:03,599
what would i recommend to the grower i

1141
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:05,760
would say if you're a grower who um

1142
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:07,280
is looking to reduce their inputs which

1143
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:09,839
i think every viticulturist should be

1144
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:11,359
doing and i and if you are relatively

1145
00:37:09,838 --> 00:37:12,799
happy with your vineyard i think looking

1146
00:37:11,358 --> 00:37:13,920
at these annual underwine cover crops

1147
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:15,200
especially something like buckwheat

1148
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:16,880
which was pretty well controlled the

1149
00:37:15,199 --> 00:37:18,559
weeds were relatively low

1150
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:21,039
it established very consistently year to

1151
00:37:18,559 --> 00:37:24,078
year and i just was not seeing effects i

1152
00:37:21,039 --> 00:37:25,838
would say why not try it why risk using

1153
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:27,519
herbicide over and over destroying your

1154
00:37:25,838 --> 00:37:29,838
soil structure destroying your soil

1155
00:37:27,519 --> 00:37:30,960
health when you have another option

1156
00:37:29,838 --> 00:37:33,119
and then potentially something like

1157
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:35,440
chicory which was showing those that

1158
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:36,960
potential benefit beneficial reduction

1159
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:38,880
in yield which is a weird phrase to say

1160
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:41,280
but you know that's how our industry is

1161
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:42,720
i would say why not try it um i think

1162
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:44,640
there's a lot of perception that people

1163
00:37:42,719 --> 00:37:46,639
are really afraid of the cover crops

1164
00:37:44,639 --> 00:37:49,199
getting close to the fruiting zone and

1165
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:50,559
um i definitely mowed at the first site

1166
00:37:49,199 --> 00:37:52,239
because it was a commercial vineyard but

1167
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:53,838
i did not touch anything at the second

1168
00:37:52,239 --> 00:37:55,679
site i just let it go grow including

1169
00:37:53,838 --> 00:37:57,279
those flowering stalks of chicory and

1170
00:37:55,679 --> 00:37:58,960
while maybe management wise it wasn't

1171
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:00,160
pretty and had offered a little few more

1172
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:01,280
difficulties at the end of the day

1173
00:38:00,159 --> 00:38:02,960
though that was about as minimal

1174
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:04,640
maintenance as i could and it was still

1175
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:06,240
a pretty well established system so i

1176
00:38:04,639 --> 00:38:08,159
say to grow up what i would say from

1177
00:38:06,239 --> 00:38:10,078
growers is that it's unlikely you're

1178
00:38:08,159 --> 00:38:11,598
going to be seeing dramatic effects why

1179
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:13,920
not try it and see what works for your

1180
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:13,920
system

1181
00:38:14,159 --> 00:38:17,920
yeah the questions are growers ready to

1182
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:19,839
change practices the world of

1183
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:22,079
viticulture is notorious for it's like

1184
00:38:19,838 --> 00:38:25,279
the slowest rate of adoption curve ever

1185
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:27,920
in terms of any agricultural field

1186
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:29,760
we are based in history right rules and

1187
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:31,358
how we grow things how we make our wine

1188
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:33,520
that's you know literally

1189
00:38:31,358 --> 00:38:34,480
law on how you make your wine in europe

1190
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:36,719
um

1191
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:38,400
our growers ready to change i think some

1192
00:38:36,719 --> 00:38:39,679
are and there's always early adopters

1193
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,880
who benefit from this kind of thing

1194
00:38:39,679 --> 00:38:42,719
there's definitely one grower in this

1195
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:44,400
region who plants buckwheat not only as

1196
00:38:42,719 --> 00:38:45,919
an inter-row cover crop but just

1197
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:47,519
everywhere under vines in a rows

1198
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:48,880
everywhere he's willing to try it you

1199
00:38:47,519 --> 00:38:49,759
know you'll always have those people who

1200
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:51,519
are

1201
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:53,200
and i think it's stepping away a bit of

1202
00:38:51,519 --> 00:38:55,358
that perception of that very nice

1203
00:38:53,199 --> 00:38:56,399
looking vineyard of having vegetation

1204
00:38:55,358 --> 00:38:58,078
free

1205
00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:02,240
and stepping more into maybe more of the

1206
00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:03,519
agroman ecosystem management perspective

1207
00:39:02,239 --> 00:39:05,439
at the end of the day vineyards are also

1208
00:39:03,519 --> 00:39:06,960
places where people host weddings and

1209
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:08,480
those sorts of things and it's always

1210
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:09,679
hard for me to remove that when i'm at

1211
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:14,000
the end of the day asking a grower to

1212
00:39:09,679 --> 00:39:15,519
make do something a little different

1213
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,480
the chicory

1214
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:18,320
yeah

1215
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:20,480
good question um

1216
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:22,640
i think even though the resulting vine

1217
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:24,800
water status isn't being isn't that

1218
00:39:22,639 --> 00:39:26,719
different because these are own root or

1219
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:28,160
not own rooted sorry but these are

1220
00:39:26,719 --> 00:39:29,919
vines that while grown with some

1221
00:39:28,159 --> 00:39:31,199
irrigation

1222
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:33,280
i still think these roots are going

1223
00:39:31,199 --> 00:39:35,279
incredibly deep as we can see off in the

1224
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:36,880
finger lakes and i think maybe while the

1225
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:38,960
whole vine water status isn't being that

1226
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:40,559
affected they are having to rely on

1227
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:42,240
drawing water from those deeper roots

1228
00:39:40,559 --> 00:39:43,119
than the upper surface of the roots

1229
00:39:42,239 --> 00:39:45,118
where the

1230
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:46,640
cover crop is actively growing and i

1231
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:48,160
think there might be some of that just

1232
00:39:46,639 --> 00:39:49,920
physiological differences that are

1233
00:39:48,159 --> 00:39:51,519
causing some of that

1234
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:52,880
similarly uh

1235
00:39:51,519 --> 00:39:55,199
it is known

1236
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:57,119
that pre-verizon water deficits will

1237
00:39:55,199 --> 00:39:59,598
significantly impact fruit set that's

1238
00:39:57,119 --> 00:40:00,960
mark matthews work and um i think maybe

1239
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:02,480
there were just some differences but

1240
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:05,280
just so slight that statistically they

1241
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:06,719
weren't there but um i yeah i don't

1242
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:08,480
really have a great question or answer

1243
00:40:06,719 --> 00:40:10,159
to that unfortunately but i think it has

1244
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:11,519
a lot to do with just the sensitivity of

1245
00:40:10,159 --> 00:40:13,440
my measurements

1246
00:40:11,519 --> 00:40:14,800
and maybe some physiological processes

1247
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:17,280
going on in the vine that i'm not able

1248
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:17,280
to detect

1249
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:20,159
sure

1250
00:40:18,318 --> 00:40:21,119
i establish my cover crops by hand

1251
00:40:20,159 --> 00:40:23,679
seeding

1252
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:25,760
and hand cultivating over them um it's

1253
00:40:23,679 --> 00:40:27,919
not that glorious but uh it was

1254
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:30,960
efficient they sufficiently emerged

1255
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:32,159
every year um we there is if this was to

1256
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:33,358
be adopted on a larger scale we

1257
00:40:32,159 --> 00:40:34,960
understand most growers are not going to

1258
00:40:33,358 --> 00:40:37,039
be willing to walk over their acres and

1259
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:39,679
acres of vineyards with hand seating but

1260
00:40:37,039 --> 00:40:41,039
uh there's interest and potential with a

1261
00:40:39,679 --> 00:40:43,118
few of our collaborators and the

1262
00:40:41,039 --> 00:40:44,559
extension side of things that have been

1263
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:46,400
coming up with different ideas of how to

1264
00:40:44,559 --> 00:40:48,159
implement this on a vineyard level scale

1265
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:50,160
but yeah i know that's right now is just

1266
00:40:48,159 --> 00:40:52,960
just just me myself and i have labor of

1267
00:40:50,159 --> 00:40:54,799
hand seating

1268
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:56,079
yeah so the questions about the site to

1269
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:57,039
site differences which there certainly

1270
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:58,079
was

1271
00:40:57,039 --> 00:40:59,599
definitely i think there were

1272
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:01,440
differences by the nature of the age of

1273
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:03,760
the vines as i said that first sight was

1274
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:05,599
almost 20 year old vines and the second

1275
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:07,920
site here these vines are younger and um

1276
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:09,280
i think it's just a little less fertile

1277
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:11,519
a little less fertile a little less deep

1278
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:12,800
soil of a site um what is interesting to

1279
00:41:11,519 --> 00:41:15,199
know though the one

1280
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:16,880
carryover cover crop of buckwheat pretty

1281
00:41:15,199 --> 00:41:18,719
much had no significant effects at

1282
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:20,880
either side so that's sort of my take

1283
00:41:18,719 --> 00:41:22,078
home message there's going to be more

1284
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:23,599
and less vigorous sites here in the

1285
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:25,680
finger lakes we have vineyards planted

1286
00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:26,640
on the whole range of them here so at

1287
00:41:25,679 --> 00:41:28,559
the end of the day i was trying to look

1288
00:41:26,639 --> 00:41:30,239
at more the state good step back from

1289
00:41:28,559 --> 00:41:31,440
what i can say at this particular site

1290
00:41:30,239 --> 00:41:32,959
and what could i say about the general

1291
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:34,480
trend of using underlying cover crops as

1292
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:36,159
a whole but yeah there's certainly were

1293
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:37,760
site differences

1294
00:41:36,159 --> 00:41:39,039
and that's something to consider for any

1295
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:40,720
grower you know

1296
00:41:39,039 --> 00:41:42,318
if they were looking to change up their

1297
00:41:40,719 --> 00:41:44,159
vineyard floor management is how their

1298
00:41:42,318 --> 00:41:45,679
site may differ but both these sites

1299
00:41:44,159 --> 00:41:47,759
were relatively fertile and both sites

1300
00:41:45,679 --> 00:41:48,559
were exhibiting excessive vegetative

1301
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:51,920
growth

1302
00:41:48,559 --> 00:41:51,920
so that's why they were selected

1303
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:56,800
any more questions

1304
00:41:55,599 --> 00:41:58,160
well thank you all for coming please

1305
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:59,519
help yourself to any food remaining and

1306
00:41:58,159 --> 00:42:02,519
i'm up here if you want any further

1307
00:41:59,519 --> 00:42:02,519
questions

1308
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:12,359
this has been a production of cornell
