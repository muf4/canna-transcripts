1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:13,279
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,238 --> 00:00:16,760
University Cornell oh yeah when I was a

3
00:00:13,279 --> 00:00:21,309
graduate student I was very much aware

4
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:25,220
of group led by Ed lemon here Musgraves

5
00:00:21,309 --> 00:00:31,989
doing photosynthesis research sort of

6
00:00:25,219 --> 00:00:34,460
moving from the laboratory skater's

7
00:00:31,989 --> 00:00:36,979
reductionist approach to photosynthesis

8
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:40,640
out into the field and you know there's

9
00:00:36,979 --> 00:00:43,669
you know iconic paper Suns work in it's

10
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:47,329
a corn field that was maybe 1965

11
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:49,400
something like that science just so it's

12
00:00:47,329 --> 00:00:51,379
always been I've always been interested

13
00:00:49,399 --> 00:00:54,170
in Cornell I've never visited here

14
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:54,890
before so it's been it's good to be here

15
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:58,070
I

16
00:00:54,890 --> 00:01:03,439
and it's good to to experience the

17
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:08,659
legendary winter I was very lucky to get

18
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:11,929
here but with Young's help we made it

19
00:01:08,659 --> 00:01:14,390
and made this work so I'm interested as

20
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:17,930
it says in photosynthesis and what I'm

21
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:23,569
trying to do is to patch together ways

22
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:26,960
to model and measure photosynthesis at

23
00:01:23,569 --> 00:01:29,599
large scales while not forgetting the

24
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:32,179
mechanisms that underlie it so I'm

25
00:01:29,599 --> 00:01:35,509
trying to make the connections the

26
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:39,320
long-term goal is really to come up with

27
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:40,930
a way of monitoring photosynthesis to

28
00:01:39,319 --> 00:01:43,969
understand what controls it and

29
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:48,140
particularly to see whether things like

30
00:01:43,969 --> 00:01:50,929
climate change are changing it land-use

31
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:55,340
change how are we doing in agriculture

32
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:57,470
and things like this the photosynthesis

33
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:59,750
is really the primary driver of all

34
00:01:57,469 --> 00:02:04,250
these productivity processes and then of

35
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:07,969
course is linked as you mentioned

36
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:12,379
transpiration and to the hydrologic

37
00:02:07,969 --> 00:02:13,330
cycle and actually to weather so it's

38
00:02:12,379 --> 00:02:18,549
been

39
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:22,180
a lot of fun kind of middle of all this

40
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:25,840
stuff in working with things like our

41
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:30,159
system models so I'll talk mostly today

42
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:35,469
about fluorescence which is really the

43
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:37,689
expert on and a little bit about ways

44
00:02:35,469 --> 00:02:40,180
that we're trying to build on what we

45
00:02:37,689 --> 00:02:45,609
learned from chlorophyll fluorescence to

46
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:48,569
understand the standard multi spectral

47
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:50,350
approaches that have been used by the

48
00:02:48,569 --> 00:02:54,789
satellites that have been around since

49
00:02:50,349 --> 00:02:57,849
the 1980s to see if we can improve the

50
00:02:54,789 --> 00:03:02,799
way that they do photosynthesis

51
00:02:57,849 --> 00:03:04,569
I start by so that I don't forget these

52
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:11,709
are the folks in the lab doing most of

53
00:03:04,569 --> 00:03:17,639
the work I and this is Grayson Badgley

54
00:03:11,709 --> 00:03:21,489
who's done recently work on reflectance

55
00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:25,929
convert linking reflectance measurements

56
00:03:21,489 --> 00:03:30,239
to the solar news fluorescence you lose

57
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:36,010
a modeller radiation transport modeler

58
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:38,650
Arie is doing the doing measurements I

59
00:03:36,009 --> 00:03:40,569
sort of lab measurements working out the

60
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:43,150
techniques for major in fluorescent

61
00:03:40,569 --> 00:03:47,560
fluorescence from fields Jan is a

62
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:49,689
modeler working with me on extending the

63
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:57,120
the models that we've made of

64
00:03:49,689 --> 00:03:59,409
photosynthesis Lee is a is doing work on

65
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,420
he's a great statistician and he's

66
00:03:59,409 --> 00:04:04,500
working with us on putting this together

67
00:04:01,419 --> 00:04:09,939
and try and do global simulations

68
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:14,049
yuuichi is doing geostatistics trying to

69
00:04:09,939 --> 00:04:18,339
show how solar news fluorescence works

70
00:04:14,049 --> 00:04:21,160
as a variable driving or correlating

71
00:04:18,339 --> 00:04:23,769
with gross primary productivity trying

72
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:26,850
to approach it from the data as opposed

73
00:04:23,769 --> 00:04:29,909
to the modeling approach and this is you

74
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:35,670
we'll Ryu who is a sabbatic bizza tur

75
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:38,730
from from Seoul Korea and they do most

76
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:42,120
of the work so I want to make sure they

77
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:47,550
have credit to start out with I thought

78
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:49,500
I'd the way I look at it I you know it's

79
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:52,620
driven by the Sun of course but I think

80
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:57,000
it's useful to think about really how is

81
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:59,100
it linked up think of it the radiations

82
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:02,389
coming from the Sun really comes from

83
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:07,290
the collision of mostly hydrogen atoms

84
00:05:02,389 --> 00:05:10,979
in the Solar solar atmosphere right at

85
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:13,860
the top and when a wonderful two

86
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:16,350
molecules or two atoms like this collide

87
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:19,110
there's a really rapid change in

88
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:25,140
velocity when that happens electrons

89
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:27,750
jump around and the a good deal of most

90
00:05:25,139 --> 00:05:30,509
of the energy of that collision gets

91
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:34,319
transferred into the emission of like

92
00:05:30,509 --> 00:05:37,620
romantic electromagnetic radiation and

93
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:39,839
the average energy of those is coupled

94
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:45,269
to the temperature the Sun is about

95
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:48,599
6,000 K so and that's the mechanism that

96
00:05:45,269 --> 00:05:52,680
some the energy produced by that

97
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:54,960
thermonuclear reactions get released at

98
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:59,430
the surface it's just blackbody

99
00:05:54,959 --> 00:06:02,329
radiation so every photon that comes out

100
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:07,050
is really related to the collision of

101
00:06:02,329 --> 00:06:11,039
atoms on the Sun some of those photons

102
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:12,720
get earth and some fairly large fraction

103
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:14,520
of them actually wind up getting

104
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:19,860
absorbed by chlorophyll if they're in

105
00:06:14,519 --> 00:06:22,579
the right wavelengths so it's eight

106
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:29,100
minutes from the Sun to the chlorophyll

107
00:06:22,579 --> 00:06:31,620
the electron is promoted to a higher

108
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:36,150
energy orbital in the chlorophyll

109
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:37,918
molecule and basically it has the energy

110
00:06:36,149 --> 00:06:40,679
of this collision that happened just

111
00:06:37,918 --> 00:06:43,019
shortly ago and in

112
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:47,009
relative listing terms simultaneously on

113
00:06:43,019 --> 00:06:50,909
the Sun so in a way a part of that

114
00:06:47,009 --> 00:07:00,419
molecule is at 6,000 K weight huh

115
00:06:50,910 --> 00:07:06,300
could do a lot and it of course is

116
00:07:00,418 --> 00:07:09,060
unstable in this configuration but it

117
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:17,310
has trapped at least momentarily the

118
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:20,009
energy and what it's done is essentially

119
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:22,860
promoted that electron on chlorophyll

120
00:07:20,009 --> 00:07:25,400
molecule to a higher state as you know

121
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:30,509
the the blue absorption of chlorophyll

122
00:07:25,399 --> 00:07:38,839
degrades to the red first excited state

123
00:07:30,509 --> 00:07:43,560
and it can decay or move to other other

124
00:07:38,839 --> 00:07:48,929
decay by fluorescence or photochemistry

125
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:51,300
or other pathways basically these are

126
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:54,478
what I'm going to use fee for is a

127
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:57,780
fluorescence or a yield and the yield of

128
00:07:54,478 --> 00:08:00,990
all the processes that can be involved

129
00:07:57,779 --> 00:08:06,029
in the the excitation of that absorbed

130
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:09,780
packet of energy as up to one in terms

131
00:08:06,029 --> 00:08:15,418
of sort of structural biology someplace

132
00:08:09,779 --> 00:08:20,219
that this is the a diagram of the yeah

133
00:08:15,418 --> 00:08:22,049
kind of a symbolic diagram of the of a

134
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:25,050
photosystem two reaction center and

135
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:27,360
antenna complex where the reaction there

136
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:29,788
two reaction centers here in the in this

137
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:32,519
center and these are light harvesting

138
00:08:29,788 --> 00:08:34,889
chlorophyll proteins which are the ones

139
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:39,028
that are most likely to capture that

140
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:40,769
energy the energy is captured and moves

141
00:08:39,028 --> 00:08:44,370
from chlorophyll molecule to chlorophyll

142
00:08:40,769 --> 00:08:47,159
molecule and ultimately comes to the the

143
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:48,778
reaction center or something else

144
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:50,699
happens to it but it becomes the

145
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:53,939
reaction center there's a charge

146
00:08:50,700 --> 00:09:00,780
separation that occurs and the energy is

147
00:08:53,940 --> 00:09:03,480
in electronic state many so I just kind

148
00:09:00,779 --> 00:09:09,439
of diagrammatically it looks like this

149
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:09,440
the energy is comes in and the real

150
00:09:10,009 --> 00:09:15,870
transformative element in this is -

151
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:21,330
chlorophyll molecules that are really

152
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:23,220
oppressed close to one another and when

153
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:25,590
they're far they're apart they just set

154
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:27,509
the and transfer energy as

155
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:28,950
electromagnetic energy from one to

156
00:09:27,509 --> 00:09:31,889
another but when they're really close

157
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:34,520
together they they can interact in a way

158
00:09:31,889 --> 00:09:38,069
that where an electron moves from one

159
00:09:34,519 --> 00:09:40,679
excited chlorophyll one chlorophyll to

160
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:47,180
the other so it it's a charge separation

161
00:09:40,679 --> 00:09:50,399
and I when that charge separation occurs

162
00:09:47,179 --> 00:09:53,759
an electron can be provided from water

163
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:56,279
to quench the one that's become positive

164
00:09:53,759 --> 00:10:01,110
and the one that has the electron on it

165
00:09:56,279 --> 00:10:06,419
can move that electron over to a quinone

166
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:08,450
and ultimately to a mobile electron

167
00:10:06,419 --> 00:10:12,629
transport carrier which diffuses away

168
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:16,370
the essence of this is that what started

169
00:10:12,629 --> 00:10:21,299
out as an electromagnetic excitation

170
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:23,789
winds up causing an electronic charge

171
00:10:21,299 --> 00:10:28,679
separation which is a kind of a redox

172
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:33,120
reaction and the energy of that is

173
00:10:28,679 --> 00:10:37,669
essentially stored in the the product

174
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:42,360
here a reduced de fusible chemical

175
00:10:37,669 --> 00:10:44,669
entity so the chemin so what started in

176
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:49,289
the Sun with a collision winds up out

177
00:10:44,669 --> 00:10:53,219
here you know eight minutes and maybe a

178
00:10:49,289 --> 00:10:56,279
few hundred picoseconds as a stable

179
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:59,639
chemic chemical entity which has enough

180
00:10:56,279 --> 00:11:04,470
energy associated with it to fix carbon

181
00:10:59,639 --> 00:11:06,809
dioxide and power of the biosphere it's

182
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:07,470
not really fundamentally different than

183
00:11:06,809 --> 00:11:11,009
what we

184
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:15,269
with a silicon photocell where the

185
00:11:11,009 --> 00:11:18,208
photocell the photoelectric effect in

186
00:11:15,269 --> 00:11:22,320
silicon causes charge separations and

187
00:11:18,208 --> 00:11:24,689
these migrate to electrodes and current

188
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:27,778
flows which we conserve kind of store

189
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:31,740
that in a battery and we can drive

190
00:11:27,778 --> 00:11:34,379
around on it all right so I tend to look

191
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:38,820
at what's happening with photosynthesis

192
00:11:34,379 --> 00:11:42,028
very much in the same way that we're

193
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:45,980
using solar energy to talk to to

194
00:11:42,028 --> 00:11:51,539
generate a or charge a chemical battery

195
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:55,920
and we can then use what's in that

196
00:11:51,539 --> 00:11:58,490
battery which is in the form of reduced

197
00:11:55,919 --> 00:12:02,269
carbon compounds and oxygen

198
00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:07,339
metabolically to go over run or

199
00:12:02,269 --> 00:12:11,039
industrially to burn fossil fuels to

200
00:12:07,339 --> 00:12:14,250
generate electricity or power cars or

201
00:12:11,039 --> 00:12:18,120
whatever so all of that really goes back

202
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:27,328
to charging this large battery which is

203
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:29,909
last year just by say probably one of

204
00:12:27,328 --> 00:12:32,639
the best indicators of this is the

205
00:12:29,909 --> 00:12:34,379
oxygen in the atmosphere it's about it

206
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:39,028
takes about fifteen hundred years or

207
00:12:34,379 --> 00:12:42,028
half of the oxygen to be processed by

208
00:12:39,028 --> 00:12:47,070
redox reactions that are associated with

209
00:12:42,028 --> 00:12:49,799
this battery turning over so there's you

210
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:51,990
can see it's pretty active we kind of

211
00:12:49,799 --> 00:12:56,370
tend to think of oxygen as being stable

212
00:12:51,990 --> 00:13:00,089
and always there but in timeframes so to

213
00:12:56,370 --> 00:13:04,519
say between the last ice age and now the

214
00:13:00,089 --> 00:13:04,519
atmosphere is probably all new oxygen

215
00:13:05,389 --> 00:13:10,730
that's just kind of why I'm fascinating

216
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:10,730
the thousands

217
00:13:10,759 --> 00:13:18,720
you mentioned the stuff that we did a

218
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:20,990
long time ago in 1980 well in 1980 or so

219
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:23,690
on photosynthesis

220
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:26,000
modeling this is a picture that we I

221
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:28,220
just was at a symposium with this is

222
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:33,799
Graham Farquhar Suzanne Eve on camera

223
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:37,990
and B we did a paper that Graham

224
00:13:33,799 --> 00:13:40,399
actually got the Kyoto Prize in part for

225
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:44,690
so I thought I'd just throw that out

226
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:47,299
because we were all in our 30s or 20s at

227
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:50,600
the time that was done and it's kind of

228
00:13:47,299 --> 00:13:54,319
funny to think that's stuff you're doing

229
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:56,720
as a postdoc actually something sticks

230
00:13:54,320 --> 00:14:00,890
and something happens we had no idea

231
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:04,820
that this was in fact we had entirely

232
00:14:00,889 --> 00:14:08,480
different goals for doing the work and

233
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:13,580
it was rejected three times but it's

234
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:15,620
turned out to be reason it was with

235
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:19,070
potion planet it's the most cited paper

236
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:22,959
that plant is published but it took us I

237
00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:22,959
think three years to get it accepted

238
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:30,230
just to decide the the whole idea of it

239
00:14:27,259 --> 00:14:34,159
is to deal with this problem that

240
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:38,240
photochemistry is coming in at whatever

241
00:14:34,159 --> 00:14:40,129
rate the light comes in so the potential

242
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:43,899
from a photochemistry is entirely

243
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:48,159
dependent on clouds and solar angle and

244
00:14:43,899 --> 00:14:52,100
things like that and leaves in between

245
00:14:48,159 --> 00:14:55,789
your particular chloroplast and the Sun

246
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:57,889
and the the energy is going to be stored

247
00:14:55,789 --> 00:15:00,469
ultimately in dark reactions which

248
00:14:57,889 --> 00:15:02,870
result in co2 fixation and Simpsons

249
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:06,200
Insulza sugars which is dependent upon

250
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:08,778
the availability of co2 linked to the

251
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:12,050
availability of water temperature and

252
00:15:08,778 --> 00:15:17,659
the amount of nutrients that are in that

253
00:15:12,049 --> 00:15:20,958
the plant has to make enzymes with so

254
00:15:17,659 --> 00:15:24,759
this has an entirely different drummer

255
00:15:20,958 --> 00:15:29,929
than this but there's no place to put

256
00:15:24,759 --> 00:15:34,039
excess photochemical products so you've

257
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:37,399
got to have a way to make

258
00:15:34,039 --> 00:15:38,929
this system stay balanced so that the

259
00:15:37,399 --> 00:15:40,578
rate at which this occurs and this

260
00:15:38,929 --> 00:15:43,338
occurs are balanced because there's

261
00:15:40,578 --> 00:15:46,669
there's there's very little capacity for

262
00:15:43,339 --> 00:15:49,519
storage in between the two and that was

263
00:15:46,669 --> 00:15:54,309
the very simple idea that led to this

264
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:56,870
paper that the minimum of the rate of

265
00:15:54,309 --> 00:15:58,489
photosynthesis is a minimum of the

266
00:15:56,870 --> 00:16:02,089
capacity of either one of these

267
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:06,169
reactions a lot of the work we're doing

268
00:16:02,089 --> 00:16:09,319
right now really focuses back to well

269
00:16:06,169 --> 00:16:12,500
how does this actually fit together what

270
00:16:09,318 --> 00:16:16,278
what is that what is the mechanism that

271
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:18,948
allows this one to go at its maximum

272
00:16:16,278 --> 00:16:21,500
capacity until it reaches this one and

273
00:16:18,948 --> 00:16:25,519
then this one to go in its capacity

274
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:31,600
while this one sees it without large

275
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:35,360
losses between the two and sorry for the

276
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:38,300
scribbling slide here but the idea we're

277
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:42,379
working on right now with Jen Johnson is

278
00:16:38,299 --> 00:16:46,490
- is that the real regulation of this is

279
00:16:42,379 --> 00:16:48,639
a a cytochrome complex that sits between

280
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:50,360
photosystem 1 and photosystem two

281
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:54,399
photosystem two is the one that

282
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:58,068
generates oxygen produces an electron

283
00:16:54,399 --> 00:17:02,078
which moves to the cytochrome and then

284
00:16:58,068 --> 00:17:04,838
moves on to the photosystem 1 which

285
00:17:02,078 --> 00:17:08,750
lifts it up to the level where it can

286
00:17:04,838 --> 00:17:12,769
react protists react in carbon fixation

287
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:19,630
I the interesting thing is that when

288
00:17:12,769 --> 00:17:19,629
this system becomes light saturated this

289
00:17:20,048 --> 00:17:26,209
reaction center becomes more reduced and

290
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:29,450
this reaction center becomes more

291
00:17:26,209 --> 00:17:31,610
oxidized you'd think that both of them

292
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:33,740
would become more reduced and the reason

293
00:17:31,609 --> 00:17:36,168
that they doesn't work that way is that

294
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:39,109
this is kind of a ratchet or a regulator

295
00:17:36,169 --> 00:17:41,240
that occurs right in between and that

296
00:17:39,109 --> 00:17:45,168
there is very strong regulation at this

297
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:47,870
point which prevents if for example you

298
00:17:45,169 --> 00:17:50,330
buy a bright too bright a light

299
00:17:47,869 --> 00:17:53,479
for photosynthesis it prevents this one

300
00:17:50,329 --> 00:17:57,589
from becoming too reduced and producing

301
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:59,720
really strong reactive substrates so it

302
00:17:57,589 --> 00:18:03,289
just kind of keeps the voltage across

303
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:07,819
this whole system more or less constant

304
00:18:03,289 --> 00:18:10,519
while still allowing things to work so

305
00:18:07,819 --> 00:18:17,509
it's it's kind of a it's a kind of a

306
00:18:10,519 --> 00:18:19,910
conductor in this and so I guess I tell

307
00:18:17,509 --> 00:18:22,400
you this because we keep working on

308
00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:24,230
things like this while we're working on

309
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:27,800
large-scale photosynthesis studies

310
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:29,329
because they keep exposing things that

311
00:18:27,799 --> 00:18:31,129
we didn't understand about the

312
00:18:29,329 --> 00:18:35,779
photosynthetic mechanism it's kind of

313
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:38,150
fun to go back and play with them one of

314
00:18:35,779 --> 00:18:43,279
the reasons that we got very interested

315
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:48,290
in photosynthesis which was related to

316
00:18:43,279 --> 00:18:53,149
this yield here or fluorescence excuse

317
00:18:48,289 --> 00:18:56,808
me this is the yield of fluorescence so

318
00:18:53,150 --> 00:19:02,620
fractional yield of fluorescence it's

319
00:18:56,808 --> 00:19:06,379
it's a fairly small component but it's

320
00:19:02,619 --> 00:19:09,339
maybe 1% to 5% of all the photons that

321
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:11,840
come in are readmitted as fluorescence

322
00:19:09,339 --> 00:19:14,269
the interesting thing is that that's a

323
00:19:11,839 --> 00:19:17,000
function of the molecule itself of

324
00:19:14,269 --> 00:19:19,819
chlorophyll it's like when it's excited

325
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:22,490
it has a half time or a half life just

326
00:19:19,819 --> 00:19:25,009
like a radioactive half-life it's going

327
00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:30,319
to decay just as a function of the time

328
00:19:25,009 --> 00:19:32,808
but the exit excited state exists so it

329
00:19:30,319 --> 00:19:34,250
tells you something about all the rest

330
00:19:32,808 --> 00:19:38,808
of these things that are going on at

331
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:41,119
least the some of them if these didn't

332
00:19:38,808 --> 00:19:42,649
exist then the lifetime of fluorescence

333
00:19:41,119 --> 00:19:47,539
would be very long and you would

334
00:19:42,650 --> 00:19:51,320
approach a yield of one so it gives you

335
00:19:47,539 --> 00:19:53,808
kind of an internal clock to understand

336
00:19:51,319 --> 00:19:58,849
how photosynthesis is processing the

337
00:19:53,808 --> 00:20:02,779
photons make sense feel free to

338
00:19:58,849 --> 00:20:05,009
interrupt please so

339
00:20:02,779 --> 00:20:08,639
fluorescence is also something that we

340
00:20:05,009 --> 00:20:13,200
can major outside of the chloroplast so

341
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:14,820
it's we can then see what's going on in

342
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:16,529
the leaf by just looking at the

343
00:20:14,819 --> 00:20:19,769
fluorescence that's coming out of it

344
00:20:16,529 --> 00:20:21,990
and it's been used for 50 years or more

345
00:20:19,769 --> 00:20:23,430
to look at photosynthesis one of the

346
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:25,109
really nice things

347
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:28,920
nice approaches for looking at

348
00:20:25,109 --> 00:20:35,699
photosynthesis particularly in

349
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:38,269
laboratory situations the other thing

350
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:41,100
that I wanted to point out here is that

351
00:20:38,269 --> 00:20:43,609
some of these are passive that is

352
00:20:41,099 --> 00:20:45,990
there's kind of a wastage term and

353
00:20:43,609 --> 00:20:48,599
fluorescence which have to do simply

354
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:52,890
with a lifetime and then some of them

355
00:20:48,599 --> 00:20:55,289
are dynamic that deal are essentially

356
00:20:52,890 --> 00:20:57,900
physiologically controlled and vary with

357
00:20:55,289 --> 00:21:00,839
the system so we can see how these

358
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:04,680
dynamic components are behaving by

359
00:21:00,839 --> 00:21:08,399
following fluorescence and those dynamic

360
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:13,019
components are photochemistry itself and

361
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:14,970
a regulated step or regulated competing

362
00:21:13,019 --> 00:21:17,460
reaction we call non photochemical

363
00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:20,460
quenching which is actually kind of like

364
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:24,059
Stowe mates for life it regulates the

365
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:26,220
amount of light that comes through from

366
00:21:24,059 --> 00:21:32,129
the pigment system of the reaction

367
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:34,920
centers so in essence that problem of

368
00:21:32,130 --> 00:21:39,180
how light is just how the light

369
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:41,730
reactions are down regulated starts

370
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:46,080
before the photons even get the reaction

371
00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:52,019
center they're quenched by this non

372
00:21:46,079 --> 00:21:55,199
photochemical quenching negative how

373
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:57,920
much to go into this is we have we can

374
00:21:55,200 --> 00:22:01,910
measure fluorescence and we can measure

375
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:05,100
photosynthesis this is a gas exchange

376
00:22:01,910 --> 00:22:07,440
cuvette or a system which can measure

377
00:22:05,099 --> 00:22:10,199
the co2 and water vapor exchange of a

378
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:13,500
plant and it also has the capability of

379
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:14,789
measuring fluorescence changes in

380
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:17,819
response to chain

381
00:22:14,789 --> 00:22:22,649
changing the light environment and we

382
00:22:17,819 --> 00:22:23,519
can calculate the yield of

383
00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:26,430
photochemistry

384
00:22:23,519 --> 00:22:28,920
in this system by saying the Weller's

385
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:31,380
for electrons required for every co2

386
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:39,450
that's for photons required for every

387
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:43,800
co2 that's fixed and there is a we can

388
00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:46,890
measure the co2 exchange add to it the

389
00:22:43,799 --> 00:22:50,639
dark respiration that's going on correct

390
00:22:46,890 --> 00:22:52,980
for the photo respiratory effect and

391
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:55,170
divided by the total number of quanta

392
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:57,450
and that gets you that this is the

393
00:22:55,170 --> 00:23:00,210
number of electrons that are transported

394
00:22:57,450 --> 00:23:02,039
to account for the photosynthetic rate

395
00:23:00,210 --> 00:23:05,009
that's majored and this is a number of

396
00:23:02,039 --> 00:23:07,710
photons that are absorbed by that system

397
00:23:05,009 --> 00:23:11,129
so that gives you the apparent quantum

398
00:23:07,710 --> 00:23:14,400
yield or for a photochemical yield of

399
00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:16,560
that system with the fluorescence by

400
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:21,390
looking at the change in fluorescence

401
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:25,079
you get by applying an intense light you

402
00:23:21,390 --> 00:23:25,950
can get an estimate directly of the

403
00:23:25,079 --> 00:23:29,069
photochemistry

404
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:34,220
it comes about by making the assumption

405
00:23:29,069 --> 00:23:36,869
that when you apply an intense light you

406
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:38,450
essentially reduce all the reaction

407
00:23:36,869 --> 00:23:41,579
centers so that there are no

408
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:43,440
photochemistry stops and fluorescence is

409
00:23:41,579 --> 00:23:45,899
going to increase because photochemistry

410
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:48,180
has stopped these measurements are

411
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:50,009
actually measurements of the yield not

412
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:51,420
the actual amount of fluorescence the

413
00:23:50,009 --> 00:23:52,859
actual amount of fluorescence goes way

414
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:57,150
up when you hit it with a bright light

415
00:23:52,859 --> 00:24:00,059
but if you use a special technique which

416
00:23:57,150 --> 00:24:02,340
uses a modulated fluorescent light or

417
00:24:00,059 --> 00:24:04,349
modulated light to excite fluorescence

418
00:24:02,339 --> 00:24:06,599
and then you look at only the modulated

419
00:24:04,349 --> 00:24:13,799
component of fluorescence you see that

420
00:24:06,599 --> 00:24:16,500
yield effect and here the ratio the

421
00:24:13,799 --> 00:24:18,889
amount of fluorescence increase that is

422
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:23,759
this variable fluorescence that occurs

423
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:25,890
relative to the total modulation the

424
00:24:23,759 --> 00:24:28,049
total fluorescence that occurs this is

425
00:24:25,890 --> 00:24:28,559
the dark this is the fluorescence that

426
00:24:28,049 --> 00:24:30,538
occur

427
00:24:28,558 --> 00:24:34,079
steady-state this is what you get to

428
00:24:30,538 --> 00:24:35,278
bright light that that ratio is actually

429
00:24:34,079 --> 00:24:37,259
the photochemistry

430
00:24:35,278 --> 00:24:39,628
the efficiency of photochemistry and

431
00:24:37,259 --> 00:24:42,569
there are ways you can go through and

432
00:24:39,628 --> 00:24:43,798
count and prove that the interesting

433
00:24:42,569 --> 00:24:47,308
thing is that if you turn the light on

434
00:24:43,798 --> 00:24:49,048
allow the system to equilibrate and then

435
00:24:47,308 --> 00:24:51,720
redo this bright light you don't get

436
00:24:49,048 --> 00:24:54,329
near as much fluorescence out and this

437
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:57,690
ratio is much lower and that's because

438
00:24:54,329 --> 00:25:01,319
the photochemical yield has decreased

439
00:24:57,690 --> 00:25:03,058
because the system is responding to the

440
00:25:01,319 --> 00:25:08,099
increased light that you've applied to

441
00:25:03,058 --> 00:25:09,658
the system it's down regulated it ah the

442
00:25:08,099 --> 00:25:13,168
other interesting thing about that is if

443
00:25:09,659 --> 00:25:15,629
you look at it from fluorescence or from

444
00:25:13,169 --> 00:25:19,470
co2 exchange and you just take a bunch

445
00:25:15,628 --> 00:25:22,048
of points and calculate the yield of

446
00:25:19,470 --> 00:25:25,710
photochemistry from the two approaches

447
00:25:22,048 --> 00:25:28,470
they agree pretty well so it's a gives

448
00:25:25,710 --> 00:25:31,288
you a pretty strong indication that

449
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:34,048
eight you can measure photosynthesis

450
00:25:31,288 --> 00:25:36,298
either by looking at the way the photons

451
00:25:34,048 --> 00:25:40,500
are processed or by looking at the end

452
00:25:36,298 --> 00:25:41,778
result of that processing see you - I

453
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:44,368
[Music]

454
00:25:41,778 --> 00:25:46,618
think I'll just skip over this that the

455
00:25:44,368 --> 00:25:50,368
main point of this is that there's no

456
00:25:46,618 --> 00:25:53,069
tusen - has a whole series of regulatory

457
00:25:50,368 --> 00:25:55,319
processes to drive it some of them are

458
00:25:53,069 --> 00:25:57,599
very quick some of them take long

459
00:25:55,319 --> 00:26:01,428
periods of time and it's kind of very

460
00:25:57,599 --> 00:26:03,528
much like a current regulating IC

461
00:26:01,429 --> 00:26:11,278
responding to things that are happening

462
00:26:03,528 --> 00:26:19,440
downstream we can as I mentioned there's

463
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:21,210
this light stomata for light that is non

464
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:23,038
photochemical quenching and this would

465
00:26:21,210 --> 00:26:25,319
be the rate constant for that non

466
00:26:23,038 --> 00:26:27,509
photochemical process and this the rate

467
00:26:25,319 --> 00:26:31,349
constant for the photochemical process

468
00:26:27,509 --> 00:26:35,029
and this these data on this side are

469
00:26:31,349 --> 00:26:39,129
derived from this experiment here this

470
00:26:35,029 --> 00:26:43,069
normal graph here so this is the rate of

471
00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:46,460
co2 uptake and this is the concentration

472
00:26:43,069 --> 00:26:49,460
of co2 and of course as you increase the

473
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:54,230
co2 it goes up and up to fairly high

474
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:59,299
rate and then it saturates at co2 co2

475
00:26:54,230 --> 00:27:01,640
saturation here you'd actually improve

476
00:26:59,299 --> 00:27:04,789
this rate by giving it more light here

477
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:08,120
you can't this it's limited by the

478
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:13,339
capacity of the co2 fixing enzyme which

479
00:27:08,119 --> 00:27:15,529
is co2 so out here it's a high rate this

480
00:27:13,339 --> 00:27:19,339
is the rate of photosynthesis so this is

481
00:27:15,529 --> 00:27:21,250
this point in this point this here and

482
00:27:19,339 --> 00:27:24,319
this here correspond to one another

483
00:27:21,250 --> 00:27:25,789
photochemistry is the rate of the rate

484
00:27:24,319 --> 00:27:28,189
constant for motor chemistry is really

485
00:27:25,789 --> 00:27:29,930
high the rate constant for non

486
00:27:28,190 --> 00:27:36,980
photochemical quenching is really low

487
00:27:29,930 --> 00:27:40,100
and as the this begins to to go down in

488
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:43,099
photosynthetic rate this non

489
00:27:40,099 --> 00:27:46,609
photochemical quenching turns on and it

490
00:27:43,099 --> 00:27:49,609
corresponds to fairly stable region

491
00:27:46,609 --> 00:27:52,189
where the photochemical rate constant

492
00:27:49,609 --> 00:27:55,899
stays the same or about the same so the

493
00:27:52,190 --> 00:27:59,240
system is responding in such a way that

494
00:27:55,900 --> 00:28:01,009
the light coming in or the photons

495
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:06,140
getting into the reaction centers are

496
00:28:01,009 --> 00:28:08,480
not there they're being reduced and the

497
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:10,490
rate constant photochemistry is staying

498
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:12,860
about the same and then that system

499
00:28:10,490 --> 00:28:15,109
saturates ultimately and the rate

500
00:28:12,859 --> 00:28:19,429
constant photochemistry also drops as

501
00:28:15,109 --> 00:28:22,099
the reaction centers close so it just to

502
00:28:19,430 --> 00:28:24,620
give you an idea how that teeter-totter

503
00:28:22,099 --> 00:28:30,799
kind of thing that I Illustrated to

504
00:28:24,619 --> 00:28:35,139
begin with I works and this is there's a

505
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:44,059
lot of power in you doing fluorescence

506
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:46,759
but the guess the main thing that point

507
00:28:44,059 --> 00:28:49,129
out here is that this Pam floor imagery

508
00:28:46,759 --> 00:28:51,170
the approach that we're using to make

509
00:28:49,130 --> 00:28:54,380
all these inferences about the way

510
00:28:51,170 --> 00:28:57,590
photons process requires that we

511
00:28:54,380 --> 00:29:01,010
manipulate the light and that's not on

512
00:28:57,589 --> 00:29:04,819
if we're looking at the planet or even a

513
00:29:01,009 --> 00:29:07,609
field any as we get out in the field

514
00:29:04,819 --> 00:29:11,569
that's that's just not possible

515
00:29:07,609 --> 00:29:13,849
so we had this great method but we were

516
00:29:11,569 --> 00:29:15,169
very frustrated with the idea that he

517
00:29:13,849 --> 00:29:18,049
we're never going to really apply this

518
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:21,950
in the field we did some things like put

519
00:29:18,049 --> 00:29:25,940
together laser excitation systems to do

520
00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:29,600
that try and pull this out but you know

521
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:33,350
you actually can't make a laser that is

522
00:29:29,599 --> 00:29:37,789
in the visible range that's any brighter

523
00:29:33,349 --> 00:29:42,069
than a pointer and in fact if you

524
00:29:37,789 --> 00:29:45,200
actually went back and tried to license

525
00:29:42,069 --> 00:29:48,829
with the laser licensing regulations a

526
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:50,740
one of these pointers I you probably

527
00:29:48,829 --> 00:29:53,059
have to reduce most of their

528
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:54,920
considerably these are kind of

529
00:29:53,059 --> 00:29:57,769
grandfathered in so there's not much we

530
00:29:54,920 --> 00:30:01,940
can do to go out in the field and

531
00:29:57,769 --> 00:30:04,369
provide bright light to manipulate so we

532
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:06,350
more or less given up that it couldn't

533
00:30:04,369 --> 00:30:11,869
be used for regional or global scales

534
00:30:06,349 --> 00:30:16,089
even though it's and that all changed in

535
00:30:11,869 --> 00:30:18,349
about 2010 for me I was walking around a

536
00:30:16,089 --> 00:30:19,929
meeting the poster session of a meeting

537
00:30:18,349 --> 00:30:22,759
kind of at the close of the meeting

538
00:30:19,930 --> 00:30:25,580
looking at posters that had nothing to

539
00:30:22,759 --> 00:30:27,440
do with me and I stumbled on this poster

540
00:30:25,579 --> 00:30:32,809
that said hey we can major fluorescence

541
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:35,840
from space and yeah I wrote down the

542
00:30:32,809 --> 00:30:39,019
name and that's got on the phone the

543
00:30:35,839 --> 00:30:42,439
next day it turned out that it wasn't

544
00:30:39,019 --> 00:30:46,519
actually such a new deal it had been

545
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:48,799
measured before the technique was

546
00:30:46,519 --> 00:30:55,879
originally worked out in the 60 in the

547
00:30:48,799 --> 00:31:02,240
70s using very narrow filters to look at

548
00:30:55,880 --> 00:31:03,190
the light that comes off vegetated

549
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:08,170
surfaces

550
00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:11,180
it had actually been measured I with a

551
00:31:08,170 --> 00:31:12,759
reflectance satellite one of the things

552
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:16,390
that's kind of interesting about this

553
00:31:12,759 --> 00:31:18,769
comparison here these are crop circles

554
00:31:16,390 --> 00:31:23,960
irrigated sort patches in the desert and

555
00:31:18,769 --> 00:31:26,809
you can see these are in RGB color and

556
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:29,569
these are in fluorescents and this is

557
00:31:26,809 --> 00:31:33,649
really dark there's there's no light

558
00:31:29,569 --> 00:31:35,089
coming off that is the light that's

559
00:31:33,650 --> 00:31:38,230
coming here is the light that's coming

560
00:31:35,089 --> 00:31:42,049
from from chlorophyll fluorescence and

561
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:44,960
one of the things that b-doubles remote

562
00:31:42,049 --> 00:31:46,519
sensing in general if I reflect insists

563
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:49,009
there's not a lot of light reflected by

564
00:31:46,519 --> 00:31:52,879
the uninteresting part of the land

565
00:31:49,009 --> 00:31:56,839
surface and it's really messes things up

566
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:58,550
and here you can see that forget it

567
00:31:56,839 --> 00:32:00,740
you don't see it at all if you could

568
00:31:58,549 --> 00:32:05,200
just look at that you'd see the plants

569
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:08,990
much more specifically and that was the

570
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:12,220
the punchline from these two papers that

571
00:32:08,990 --> 00:32:15,890
simultaneously figured out how to

572
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:17,690
acquire the fluorescence from satellites

573
00:32:15,890 --> 00:32:20,360
that were originally designed to measure

574
00:32:17,690 --> 00:32:26,980
the concentration of gases in the

575
00:32:20,359 --> 00:32:31,309
atmosphere and this is a year's

576
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:34,390
fluorescence measurements showing that

577
00:32:31,309 --> 00:32:38,990
areas like the Amazon have very and the

578
00:32:34,390 --> 00:32:42,650
Indonesia and tropical Africa have the

579
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:45,829
highest rates of fluorescence and things

580
00:32:42,650 --> 00:32:50,530
more or less follow the patterns that we

581
00:32:45,829 --> 00:32:53,769
expect so even though we couldn't

582
00:32:50,529 --> 00:32:56,329
measure do any experiments on

583
00:32:53,769 --> 00:32:58,369
manipulating the light look like this is

584
00:32:56,329 --> 00:33:02,470
coming out that's looking kind of like

585
00:32:58,369 --> 00:33:02,469
we hoped fluorescence would look anyway

586
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:09,529
and this is a graph from a recent paper

587
00:33:06,589 --> 00:33:13,039
that yang is the senior author on

588
00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:14,660
looking at fluorescence from a satellite

589
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:16,299
that was originally put in orbit to

590
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:22,360
measure carbon dioxide

591
00:33:16,299 --> 00:33:26,680
concentration and flux measured at co2

592
00:33:22,359 --> 00:33:29,289
flux towers I simultaneously with the

593
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:32,230
fluorescence measures they agree pretty

594
00:33:29,289 --> 00:33:36,670
well so this is pulling it down to a

595
00:33:32,230 --> 00:33:39,610
smaller scale the other was really based

596
00:33:36,670 --> 00:33:42,960
on what we expected for photosynthesis

597
00:33:39,609 --> 00:33:45,969
this is really based on observations

598
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:52,660
photosynthesis so it's getting close to

599
00:33:45,970 --> 00:34:00,000
home make this run here this is kind of

600
00:33:52,660 --> 00:34:00,000
fun this is a yearly fluorescence

601
00:34:00,119 --> 00:34:10,480
transit changes in fluorescence and if

602
00:34:03,430 --> 00:34:15,220
you look the we look at it up I can make

603
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:16,650
this repeat I call your attention to the

604
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:20,489
Corn Belt here

605
00:34:16,650 --> 00:34:23,950
you can see that that's really bright it

606
00:34:20,489 --> 00:34:27,159
really comes up it's it's actually the

607
00:34:23,949 --> 00:34:29,189
brightest spot on the planet probably by

608
00:34:27,159 --> 00:34:31,809
this large spot on the planet there's

609
00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:36,280
other areas that look almost as bright

610
00:34:31,809 --> 00:34:40,750
the Ganges Delta area some parts of

611
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:42,940
Europe those that's what that's saying

612
00:34:40,750 --> 00:34:45,820
is that photosynthesis in the Corn Belt

613
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:48,909
how about we during the time of crop

614
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:52,150
production is the highest of any place

615
00:34:48,909 --> 00:34:57,519
on earth you know at least a large a

616
00:34:52,150 --> 00:35:00,820
large patch this is just one of the

617
00:34:57,519 --> 00:35:07,119
things that we try to do is to measure

618
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:09,910
this also from from field instruments

619
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:12,609
this is a fluorescence equivalent of a

620
00:35:09,909 --> 00:35:15,129
satellite sitting above a soybean field

621
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:19,289
that we're working on this year what

622
00:35:15,130 --> 00:35:21,550
we're trying to do is - this is the

623
00:35:19,289 --> 00:35:23,829
absorption spectrum of chlorophyll the

624
00:35:21,550 --> 00:35:27,250
green and the red is the emission

625
00:35:23,829 --> 00:35:29,519
spectrum of chlorophyll fluorescence and

626
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:32,849
what we're

627
00:35:29,519 --> 00:35:35,009
so light that's absorbed here comes back

628
00:35:32,849 --> 00:35:39,960
some of it comes back out in these bands

629
00:35:35,010 --> 00:35:42,330
and you know if we were doing this in a

630
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:45,269
laboratory we just put in a filter so

631
00:35:42,329 --> 00:35:48,179
that we only use light we only only

632
00:35:45,269 --> 00:35:50,039
light the plant would see light that was

633
00:35:48,179 --> 00:35:52,139
in this range and then it would be dark

634
00:35:50,039 --> 00:35:55,170
in this range we could see the

635
00:35:52,139 --> 00:35:57,449
fluorescence from that very simple all

636
00:35:55,170 --> 00:36:01,670
right that's kind of hard to do again in

637
00:35:57,449 --> 00:36:06,179
the field because filtering the sunlight

638
00:36:01,670 --> 00:36:09,090
doesn't work very well so it's would

639
00:36:06,179 --> 00:36:12,329
require a pretty large filter to to

640
00:36:09,090 --> 00:36:13,860
filter the Earth's input radiation so we

641
00:36:12,329 --> 00:36:16,920
could walk walk for blocking

642
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:19,680
fluorescence but the the way we do way

643
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:22,889
that they figured out how to do this was

644
00:36:19,679 --> 00:36:25,829
to look at the spectral composition of

645
00:36:22,889 --> 00:36:28,019
the light that's coming down that of

646
00:36:25,829 --> 00:36:30,569
course affects the spectral composition

647
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:33,780
light that's going up and wait.you

648
00:36:30,570 --> 00:36:37,100
what's shown here a lot of what looks

649
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:40,800
like noise but it isn't noise it's

650
00:36:37,099 --> 00:36:42,929
changes in the composition of the or the

651
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:45,450
intensity of the lights a function of

652
00:36:42,929 --> 00:36:47,539
wavelength which occurs because of

653
00:36:45,449 --> 00:36:49,980
things like iron and magnesium and

654
00:36:47,539 --> 00:36:53,820
elements like that in the solar

655
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:58,079
atmosphere that absorb light and they

656
00:36:53,820 --> 00:37:01,160
cause these little divots and you see

657
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:04,009
them again in the upwelling light

658
00:37:01,159 --> 00:37:06,119
because it's essentially sunlight edge

659
00:37:04,010 --> 00:37:09,090
reflecting it doesn't change its

660
00:37:06,119 --> 00:37:13,619
spectral composition but fluorescence is

661
00:37:09,090 --> 00:37:16,890
new light there's no impact of the fact

662
00:37:13,619 --> 00:37:20,549
there's no impact of these spectral

663
00:37:16,889 --> 00:37:25,409
features of the sunlight on the spectrum

664
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:29,880
of the fluorescence so if you think of

665
00:37:25,409 --> 00:37:34,759
it the light that you get back out is a

666
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:39,869
function of the fluorescence coming out

667
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:43,350
and the light that's coming from the Sun

668
00:37:39,869 --> 00:37:47,699
which does and if you

669
00:37:43,349 --> 00:37:51,839
use a a statistical tool it's kind of

670
00:37:47,699 --> 00:37:54,689
like n member unmixing you can separate

671
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:57,809
those two you can determine what

672
00:37:54,690 --> 00:38:00,840
fraction of the total they're for red

673
00:37:57,809 --> 00:38:03,029
light is coming back at you has come

674
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:06,150
from fluorescence and what is just

675
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:09,000
scattered light and that is made

676
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:11,789
possible by having satellites that have

677
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:16,349
the spectral resolution to resolve these

678
00:38:11,789 --> 00:38:20,400
lines I we focus mostly on these lines

679
00:38:16,349 --> 00:38:22,409
which we do to front offers mishit

680
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:25,320
estranja for absorptions in the solar

681
00:38:22,409 --> 00:38:29,609
atmosphere this big feature is due to

682
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:33,240
oxygen in the Earth's atmosphere and a

683
00:38:29,610 --> 00:38:35,880
lot of people work with this it's it's a

684
00:38:33,239 --> 00:38:38,819
much bigger signal it's much easier to

685
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:41,789
separate fluorescence from photos from

686
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:45,330
scattered light using this but

687
00:38:41,789 --> 00:38:48,480
unfortunately it's also due to it's due

688
00:38:45,329 --> 00:38:50,429
to the oxygen atmosphere so what you see

689
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:52,079
depends upon how much of the atmosphere

690
00:38:50,429 --> 00:38:54,119
is between you and your major Minh and

691
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:55,860
what's happened to the light has has

692
00:38:54,119 --> 00:38:57,900
come through the atmosphere before you

693
00:38:55,860 --> 00:39:00,480
actually do your measurements so it's

694
00:38:57,900 --> 00:39:02,610
it's a more complicated thing but it's

695
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:06,210
possible and this is the way that we

696
00:39:02,610 --> 00:39:08,970
make this this determination of how much

697
00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:12,389
fluorescence there is this is always a

698
00:39:08,969 --> 00:39:14,039
bit of a problematic area so if you've

699
00:39:12,389 --> 00:39:19,489
got any questions about this feel free

700
00:39:14,039 --> 00:39:23,009
to interrupt and ask it makes sense ok

701
00:39:19,489 --> 00:39:26,629
this is just if we look at fluorescence

702
00:39:23,010 --> 00:39:30,590
coming off a this is from an Amazon

703
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:34,559
canopy and all of this is due to clouds

704
00:39:30,590 --> 00:39:35,550
but if we look at the fluorescence

705
00:39:34,559 --> 00:39:39,389
that's coming out

706
00:39:35,550 --> 00:39:43,740
it's fairly well behaved and it behaves

707
00:39:39,389 --> 00:39:45,599
pretty well if we look at there are ways

708
00:39:43,739 --> 00:39:48,559
that we can sort of normalize this

709
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:51,000
either to the incoming light intensity

710
00:39:48,559 --> 00:39:53,900
or to the amount of light that's

711
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:57,329
reflected so it's kind of well-behaved

712
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:58,559
the measurement has is difficult

713
00:39:57,329 --> 00:40:00,719
we're looking at these very small

714
00:39:58,559 --> 00:40:02,219
spectral features but if we're really

715
00:40:00,719 --> 00:40:06,298
careful the way we do spectroscopy

716
00:40:02,219 --> 00:40:07,889
cultural temperatures do a lot of signal

717
00:40:06,298 --> 00:40:12,119
averaging and things like that we get

718
00:40:07,889 --> 00:40:15,179
pretty good data so yeah we got this

719
00:40:12,119 --> 00:40:17,160
method based on resolving these fine

720
00:40:15,179 --> 00:40:20,848
spectral details that gives us the light

721
00:40:17,159 --> 00:40:26,028
emitted by chlorophyll it's a pretty

722
00:40:20,849 --> 00:40:29,849
powerful proxy for photosynthesis I and

723
00:40:26,028 --> 00:40:31,429
I guess the initial thought that we had

724
00:40:29,849 --> 00:40:34,229
was that this would all be due to

725
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:36,328
changes in fluorescence you tell us

726
00:40:34,228 --> 00:40:39,558
about the physiology the plants and that

727
00:40:36,329 --> 00:40:42,719
would tell us all about photosynthesis

728
00:40:39,559 --> 00:40:45,569
as we've gotten more and more involved

729
00:40:42,719 --> 00:40:48,229
in this it's become clear that the

730
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:51,358
structure of the canopy that's doing

731
00:40:48,228 --> 00:40:53,149
photosynthesis has an awful lot to do

732
00:40:51,358 --> 00:40:57,958
with how much fluorescence gets out

733
00:40:53,150 --> 00:41:00,239
maybe even more than the the yield so

734
00:40:57,958 --> 00:41:02,489
and that has the really key component

735
00:41:00,239 --> 00:41:05,119
here is what we call the escape

736
00:41:02,489 --> 00:41:09,528
probability which is the probability

737
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:11,910
that emitted fluorescent photon that's

738
00:41:09,528 --> 00:41:13,798
photons are submitted in the canopy

739
00:41:11,909 --> 00:41:16,708
actually makes it out so that we could

740
00:41:13,798 --> 00:41:21,239
measure it and that's very dependent

741
00:41:16,708 --> 00:41:24,868
upon both the the observational geometry

742
00:41:21,239 --> 00:41:27,059
so it changes as you say a satellite

743
00:41:24,869 --> 00:41:31,619
looks at the surface from different

744
00:41:27,059 --> 00:41:34,499
directions or if you're looking at the

745
00:41:31,619 --> 00:41:38,190
same piece of canopy and the Sun were to

746
00:41:34,498 --> 00:41:41,238
go through a you know the daily course

747
00:41:38,190 --> 00:41:44,699
you'd also see that this emission

748
00:41:41,239 --> 00:41:46,798
parameter would change so it's a

749
00:41:44,699 --> 00:41:51,989
directional property of the canopy

750
00:41:46,798 --> 00:41:56,358
itself just to sort of go back to that

751
00:41:51,989 --> 00:41:59,039
diagram what's happening here is that

752
00:41:56,358 --> 00:42:02,458
photon is absorbed in some of it gets to

753
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:05,209
the reaction center some of it since

754
00:42:02,458 --> 00:42:08,998
this takes a finite period of time

755
00:42:05,208 --> 00:42:11,489
chlorophyll fluorescence comes out while

756
00:42:08,998 --> 00:42:14,339
it's in transit and

757
00:42:11,489 --> 00:42:18,119
it tells you essentially something about

758
00:42:14,340 --> 00:42:21,620
the lifetime that the photon or the

759
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:23,759
excited state has in this pigment bed

760
00:42:21,619 --> 00:42:24,929
longer the lifetime the more

761
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:32,630
fluorescence is going to come out

762
00:42:24,929 --> 00:42:37,409
relative to other things I think I

763
00:42:32,630 --> 00:42:41,190
probably skip all this and just say that

764
00:42:37,409 --> 00:42:43,319
we have we've been working to of course

765
00:42:41,190 --> 00:42:45,389
one thing to do is to put this into a

766
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:46,789
model of photosynthesis and see if we

767
00:42:45,389 --> 00:42:49,829
can figure out well how's that

768
00:42:46,789 --> 00:42:51,360
physiology control this and this is a

769
00:42:49,829 --> 00:42:53,849
series of simulations where we're

770
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:56,070
looking at photosynthetic rate as a

771
00:42:53,849 --> 00:42:59,279
function of light if we change the

772
00:42:56,070 --> 00:43:01,890
amount of the co2 fixing enzyme rubisco

773
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:04,500
so here is very low levels and very high

774
00:43:01,889 --> 00:43:06,119
levels this has an effect on the yield

775
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:09,000
of photochemistry we've got more

776
00:43:06,119 --> 00:43:12,630
capacity the ELA photochemistry can be

777
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:16,739
higher i and get some fairly complicated

778
00:43:12,630 --> 00:43:21,360
patterns of the fluorescence yield as a

779
00:43:16,739 --> 00:43:26,879
function of increasing decreasing to be

780
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:29,150
max and this here is the simulated Sol

781
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:32,570
reduced fluorescence you can see that

782
00:43:29,150 --> 00:43:34,650
there are some differences as high

783
00:43:32,570 --> 00:43:38,970
photosynthetic capacity you tend to get

784
00:43:34,650 --> 00:43:41,070
more Sol reduce fluorescence than at low

785
00:43:38,969 --> 00:43:44,399
photosynthetic capacity but it's known

786
00:43:41,070 --> 00:43:48,720
if nowhere near the linear zero

787
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:56,960
intercept relationship which we see in

788
00:43:48,719 --> 00:43:58,709
Yang's data for example and if we do

789
00:43:56,960 --> 00:44:01,250
simulations with a model that

790
00:43:58,710 --> 00:44:04,010
incorporates radiation transport

791
00:44:01,250 --> 00:44:08,420
photosynthesis and fluorescence yield

792
00:44:04,010 --> 00:44:11,630
and we very things which vary that the

793
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:16,380
near-infrared reflectance of the canopy

794
00:44:11,630 --> 00:44:21,710
by changing leaf angle distribution leaf

795
00:44:16,380 --> 00:44:24,720
area index fractional vegetation cover

796
00:44:21,710 --> 00:44:27,690
soil color and things like that

797
00:44:24,719 --> 00:44:32,879
we we change the amount of solar news

798
00:44:27,690 --> 00:44:34,769
fluorescence and if we change keep go

799
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:37,230
through that same matrix of things and

800
00:44:34,769 --> 00:44:40,108
change the fluorescent yield you get a

801
00:44:37,230 --> 00:44:42,179
different slope so it looks like what we

802
00:44:40,108 --> 00:44:45,449
see is something that's we see two

803
00:44:42,179 --> 00:44:48,269
effects one is related to the

804
00:44:45,449 --> 00:44:51,000
essentially structure of the canopy and

805
00:44:48,269 --> 00:44:52,619
the other is related to the fluorescence

806
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:57,320
and we have the two things

807
00:44:52,619 --> 00:45:01,950
simultaneously affecting what we see

808
00:44:57,320 --> 00:45:04,680
from looking from space this is just to

809
00:45:01,949 --> 00:45:07,379
show you something about what we expect

810
00:45:04,679 --> 00:45:09,779
from the fluorescence itself based on

811
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:12,840
those models so we're looking with a

812
00:45:09,780 --> 00:45:15,000
satellite at the same time of day most

813
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:16,769
of satellites we're using at polar

814
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:19,409
orbits and they come over at the same

815
00:45:16,769 --> 00:45:21,590
solar time for each space so we're

816
00:45:19,409 --> 00:45:25,679
always looking at the same illumination

817
00:45:21,590 --> 00:45:29,280
this is say illuminated with full Sun

818
00:45:25,679 --> 00:45:32,429
and lots of photosynthetic capacity this

819
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:35,250
is the photochemistry this is the non

820
00:45:32,429 --> 00:45:39,960
photochemical quenching this is the sort

821
00:45:35,250 --> 00:45:42,809
of wastage term and this is what's lost

822
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:45,150
by fluorescence as you go to lower

823
00:45:42,809 --> 00:45:48,449
capacity the photo chemistry goes down

824
00:45:45,150 --> 00:45:52,050
the non photochemistry non photochemical

825
00:45:48,449 --> 00:45:57,739
quenching goes up really goes up when

826
00:45:52,050 --> 00:46:00,180
you have stress but the this is the

827
00:45:57,739 --> 00:46:05,219
fluorescence and this is that

828
00:46:00,179 --> 00:46:07,829
fluorescence expanded ten times so this

829
00:46:05,219 --> 00:46:11,459
just shows that yeah there's some

830
00:46:07,829 --> 00:46:16,409
sensitivity to the environment but that

831
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:24,470
sensitivity is is not the whole story at

832
00:46:16,409 --> 00:46:26,969
least we have wanted to do this to

833
00:46:24,469 --> 00:46:31,129
couple with these kinds of measurements

834
00:46:26,969 --> 00:46:35,358
you can measure the gas exchange of a

835
00:46:31,130 --> 00:46:35,358
system we do it for time

836
00:46:39,449 --> 00:46:46,419
you can measure the co2 exchange and

837
00:46:44,309 --> 00:46:48,549
essentially reconstruct with the gross

838
00:46:46,420 --> 00:46:51,610
primary productivity is but these are

839
00:46:48,550 --> 00:46:55,090
areas that about a kilometer at most in

840
00:46:51,610 --> 00:46:57,070
size and the solar it is fluorescence

841
00:46:55,090 --> 00:47:02,890
measurements that we're trying to make

842
00:46:57,070 --> 00:47:04,690
are normally in the range of the most

843
00:47:02,889 --> 00:47:07,139
frequent one the one to use the most has

844
00:47:04,690 --> 00:47:10,329
a footprint of 40 kilometers on the side

845
00:47:07,139 --> 00:47:14,859
so they're too big to actually match

846
00:47:10,329 --> 00:47:18,279
with these sites all right but if we

847
00:47:14,860 --> 00:47:20,230
could match with these sites we have

848
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:22,210
maybe a hundred of these around the

849
00:47:20,230 --> 00:47:25,179
world maybe a kilometer squared each

850
00:47:22,210 --> 00:47:27,909
that's at least a sampling of one part

851
00:47:25,179 --> 00:47:30,579
per million of the biosphere and that

852
00:47:27,909 --> 00:47:32,199
would be useful in putting together some

853
00:47:30,579 --> 00:47:37,619
information about how the whole bio

854
00:47:32,199 --> 00:47:41,049
scores I think you understand that the

855
00:47:37,619 --> 00:47:42,639
limitations of that as well but probably

856
00:47:41,050 --> 00:47:46,030
the best approach that's been made so

857
00:47:42,639 --> 00:47:50,920
far to do this is to use machine

858
00:47:46,030 --> 00:47:53,320
learning to analyze these which student

859
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:57,820
in our group you in she's been doing is

860
00:47:53,320 --> 00:48:00,970
to look at gas exchange in fairly large

861
00:47:57,820 --> 00:48:05,680
scales air moving across the continent

862
00:48:00,969 --> 00:48:09,639
and try and use models and data to

863
00:48:05,679 --> 00:48:10,839
predict or to explain the variation in

864
00:48:09,639 --> 00:48:13,719
the co2 concentration

865
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:15,850
you know what the co2 is it starts and

866
00:48:13,719 --> 00:48:17,589
you know it at the end you should be

867
00:48:15,849 --> 00:48:20,289
able to say something about what co2

868
00:48:17,590 --> 00:48:22,510
change has occurred over the path across

869
00:48:20,289 --> 00:48:24,940
continent the interesting thing from

870
00:48:22,510 --> 00:48:27,190
this is just that the models that we

871
00:48:24,940 --> 00:48:31,840
have they're sort of the state of the

872
00:48:27,190 --> 00:48:35,429
art or system models get anywhere the

873
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:37,870
best one does 0.6 our point for of the

874
00:48:35,429 --> 00:48:40,839
the variance and most of them are down

875
00:48:37,869 --> 00:48:43,089
here in fairly low compartment

876
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:45,039
part of the variance solar dues

877
00:48:43,090 --> 00:48:46,630
fluorescence by itself as a single

878
00:48:45,039 --> 00:48:48,219
variable without putting in the

879
00:48:46,630 --> 00:48:51,760
meteorology and a bunch of other

880
00:48:48,219 --> 00:48:55,089
stuff which are in these models explains

881
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:56,710
more you can explain more of it by

882
00:48:55,090 --> 00:48:59,170
putting in a couple of other variables

883
00:48:56,710 --> 00:49:02,139
but it's it's cold that this is

884
00:48:59,170 --> 00:49:06,550
something that seems to capture a lot of

885
00:49:02,139 --> 00:49:08,159
the variance that occurs and what you

886
00:49:06,550 --> 00:49:11,200
want to do when you're making a model is

887
00:49:08,159 --> 00:49:14,170
put in the data that's most has the

888
00:49:11,199 --> 00:49:17,618
largest leverage and ignore the data

889
00:49:14,170 --> 00:49:21,550
that doesn't have any leverage and

890
00:49:17,619 --> 00:49:23,800
models principally we don't do that when

891
00:49:21,550 --> 00:49:26,859
we make we put in everything including

892
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:30,730
the kitchen sink so this is kind of a

893
00:49:26,858 --> 00:49:34,090
refreshing way of looking at it alright

894
00:49:30,730 --> 00:49:45,099
so I think we'll skip over that quickly

895
00:49:34,090 --> 00:49:50,108
and go on the idea that we worked on was

896
00:49:45,099 --> 00:49:53,890
the observation that the light that was

897
00:49:50,108 --> 00:49:56,139
coming from read reflected by the canopy

898
00:49:53,889 --> 00:49:58,629
in the near infrared seem to correlate

899
00:49:56,139 --> 00:50:02,829
quite well with then it was coming off

900
00:49:58,630 --> 00:50:07,150
fluorescence if we were looking at full

901
00:50:02,829 --> 00:50:09,460
canopies and this is sorting out pixels

902
00:50:07,150 --> 00:50:11,588
by their normalized difference

903
00:50:09,460 --> 00:50:13,150
vegetation index so when that vegetation

904
00:50:11,588 --> 00:50:15,909
index is high you get a really high

905
00:50:13,150 --> 00:50:19,809
correlation with the reflectance and as

906
00:50:15,909 --> 00:50:22,449
it goes down to less vegetated pixels of

907
00:50:19,809 --> 00:50:24,369
course that correlation goes away so we

908
00:50:22,449 --> 00:50:26,710
thought well let's just multiply the

909
00:50:24,369 --> 00:50:28,900
total near phred reflectance times the

910
00:50:26,710 --> 00:50:34,210
NDVI and see what happens and this is

911
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:36,639
SIF and that product they fall in line

912
00:50:34,210 --> 00:50:39,760
really nicely and the thing that's

913
00:50:36,639 --> 00:50:45,190
really nice about this even though it's

914
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:48,160
kind of a derived product we've got that

915
00:50:45,190 --> 00:50:50,380
at 300 meters resolution 300 meters

916
00:50:48,159 --> 00:50:54,368
ground resolution and we have it from

917
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:58,180
1980 to present so we can now look at

918
00:50:54,369 --> 00:50:59,829
flux ice with something that looks a

919
00:50:58,179 --> 00:51:01,838
little bit like solar news fluorescence

920
00:50:59,829 --> 00:51:06,038
it isn't exactly the same

921
00:51:01,838 --> 00:51:09,460
has some of the same properties this is

922
00:51:06,039 --> 00:51:14,009
just looking at this that correlated

923
00:51:09,460 --> 00:51:20,519
with some global models again just the

924
00:51:14,009 --> 00:51:23,259
the annual NRV sum and the GPP modelled

925
00:51:20,518 --> 00:51:25,389
so they it captures a lot of the

926
00:51:23,259 --> 00:51:29,650
variability in the biosphere all by

927
00:51:25,389 --> 00:51:34,838
itself what we're looking at is

928
00:51:29,650 --> 00:51:36,759
essentially the the normalized

929
00:51:34,838 --> 00:51:39,038
difference vegetation index is this

930
00:51:36,759 --> 00:51:41,619
error this reflectance here this green

931
00:51:39,039 --> 00:51:44,259
is the reflectance of a leaf and you

932
00:51:41,619 --> 00:51:49,869
look at it it looks at the ratio of this

933
00:51:44,259 --> 00:51:52,978
band to and band for the difference

934
00:51:49,869 --> 00:51:58,838
between those two over the sum of those

935
00:51:52,978 --> 00:52:00,939
and the this is a spectrum of soil you

936
00:51:58,838 --> 00:52:03,639
can see that there's some slope there

937
00:52:00,940 --> 00:52:06,940
but not nearly as much so that is that

938
00:52:03,639 --> 00:52:08,379
vegetation index for the soil if you

939
00:52:06,940 --> 00:52:10,838
were looking at soil would be very low

940
00:52:08,380 --> 00:52:15,099
vegetation index you're looking at at

941
00:52:10,838 --> 00:52:21,759
the at a vegetated area would be very

942
00:52:15,099 --> 00:52:25,568
high and what we're if you think of it

943
00:52:21,759 --> 00:52:29,880
the the light that's coming off of say a

944
00:52:25,568 --> 00:52:33,460
mix pixel like this you have a very low

945
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:36,009
NDVI of the light that's coming up from

946
00:52:33,460 --> 00:52:40,478
the soil but if that's coming off from a

947
00:52:36,009 --> 00:52:44,559
leaf it has a very high if you multiply

948
00:52:40,478 --> 00:52:48,578
the total times this ratio the NDVI this

949
00:52:44,559 --> 00:52:50,950
index the NDVI you essentially get

950
00:52:48,579 --> 00:52:53,259
something it's all coming from the leaf

951
00:52:50,949 --> 00:52:55,778
it's going to be high and generic bread

952
00:52:53,259 --> 00:53:00,940
that's coming off the canopy is going to

953
00:52:55,778 --> 00:53:03,969
be off the plant and it's going to vary

954
00:53:00,940 --> 00:53:06,338
pretty much by how much a fraction of

955
00:53:03,969 --> 00:53:08,338
light that's coming out of the system is

956
00:53:06,338 --> 00:53:10,838
that's coming from the leaf it's

957
00:53:08,338 --> 00:53:12,099
actually analogous to the way that we're

958
00:53:10,838 --> 00:53:15,130
measuring fluorescence

959
00:53:12,099 --> 00:53:15,670
we're just determining how much of the

960
00:53:15,130 --> 00:53:17,410
in there

961
00:53:15,670 --> 00:53:20,170
red light is coming off leaves and

962
00:53:17,409 --> 00:53:22,989
multiplying that times the total and

963
00:53:20,170 --> 00:53:25,780
that gives us an index that's kind of

964
00:53:22,989 --> 00:53:28,659
like the fluorescence and this is what

965
00:53:25,780 --> 00:53:31,900
you see if we just take the total NIR

966
00:53:28,659 --> 00:53:34,298
and compare it this is four pixels so

967
00:53:31,900 --> 00:53:37,450
this is actually for all the all the

968
00:53:34,298 --> 00:53:39,759
land surface so this is just the total

969
00:53:37,449 --> 00:53:43,179
near-infrared coming out and you can see

970
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:45,069
it's scattered there's some some

971
00:53:43,179 --> 00:53:47,289
indication that there's something there

972
00:53:45,068 --> 00:53:50,199
but if you just multiply it by the NIR

973
00:53:47,289 --> 00:53:51,880
the NDVI you get just nice correlation

974
00:53:50,199 --> 00:53:54,879
because it throws away all these

975
00:53:51,880 --> 00:54:01,539
excellents that are influenced by clouds

976
00:53:54,880 --> 00:54:04,030
or soil or other things interfere and if

977
00:54:01,539 --> 00:54:08,949
you just take the these are flux sites

978
00:54:04,030 --> 00:54:14,530
now if you take the say a hundred or so

979
00:54:08,949 --> 00:54:19,000
flux sites and look at the annual GPP

980
00:54:14,530 --> 00:54:22,780
some and the some of the this NRB some

981
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:25,210
other things that we can analyze it

982
00:54:22,780 --> 00:54:28,180
looks it's actually quite an improvement

983
00:54:25,210 --> 00:54:30,369
over other approaches that been used in

984
00:54:28,179 --> 00:54:35,259
the past and one of the things that

985
00:54:30,369 --> 00:54:38,980
really we found very interesting of this

986
00:54:35,260 --> 00:54:40,390
is that if we took this na RV you would

987
00:54:38,980 --> 00:54:42,639
think that if you took that and

988
00:54:40,389 --> 00:54:47,019
multiplied it by the light did improve

989
00:54:42,639 --> 00:54:50,348
things but it actually makes it worse I

990
00:54:47,019 --> 00:54:54,429
and we think that what's going on what

991
00:54:50,349 --> 00:54:57,599
we're finding is that there isn't the na

992
00:54:54,429 --> 00:55:01,179
RV has most of the environmental

993
00:54:57,599 --> 00:55:03,880
correlates that have normally thought to

994
00:55:01,179 --> 00:55:07,659
drive photosynthesis already kind of

995
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:10,420
work into it and when you add another

996
00:55:07,659 --> 00:55:16,838
one or add one that's already in it you

997
00:55:10,420 --> 00:55:19,659
just add the noise so we're very

998
00:55:16,838 --> 00:55:21,759
interested in it that from that point of

999
00:55:19,659 --> 00:55:27,308
view because that means we we have a

1000
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:28,869
that a system is growing a canopy which

1001
00:55:27,309 --> 00:55:33,420
has

1002
00:55:28,869 --> 00:55:38,829
some I think we'll just skip over these

1003
00:55:33,420 --> 00:55:46,470
except to show you the canapes are very

1004
00:55:38,829 --> 00:55:50,048
diverse plants grow those canopies under

1005
00:55:46,469 --> 00:55:52,118
genetic and environmental control they

1006
00:55:50,048 --> 00:55:55,869
have very different properties in the

1007
00:55:52,119 --> 00:55:58,088
way they transport radiation but the way

1008
00:55:55,869 --> 00:56:00,309
that they reflect near-infrared

1009
00:55:58,088 --> 00:56:02,650
radiation seems to have a lot of

1010
00:56:00,309 --> 00:56:06,609
information about how they actually are

1011
00:56:02,650 --> 00:56:07,599
function and I we're really interested

1012
00:56:06,608 --> 00:56:09,759
in it from the point of view of

1013
00:56:07,599 --> 00:56:16,930
understanding the biology of this

1014
00:56:09,759 --> 00:56:18,400
control so first before stopping just

1015
00:56:16,929 --> 00:56:19,389
mentioned that there are a couple of

1016
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:23,318
other things that are really interesting

1017
00:56:19,389 --> 00:56:27,909
in this if this is an area where we're

1018
00:56:23,318 --> 00:56:29,739
looking at an area in the Amazon with

1019
00:56:27,909 --> 00:56:31,449
two different remote sensing products

1020
00:56:29,739 --> 00:56:33,729
one's better cloud filtered than the

1021
00:56:31,449 --> 00:56:35,858
other the better remote sensing product

1022
00:56:33,730 --> 00:56:37,690
has a tighter correlation so we can

1023
00:56:35,858 --> 00:56:42,699
improve this by getting better remote

1024
00:56:37,690 --> 00:56:47,470
sensing this is a c3 soybean crop this

1025
00:56:42,699 --> 00:56:48,730
is a corn crop same floor you can see

1026
00:56:47,469 --> 00:56:51,068
that there's a big difference

1027
00:56:48,730 --> 00:56:53,498
as you'd expect because of c4

1028
00:56:51,068 --> 00:56:56,788
photosynthesis things like that that can

1029
00:56:53,498 --> 00:57:01,389
also be put into to improve this system

1030
00:56:56,789 --> 00:57:04,470
it works well monthly and does as well

1031
00:57:01,389 --> 00:57:08,018
as the best models all by itself and

1032
00:57:04,469 --> 00:57:12,429
it's a pretty good job of simulating

1033
00:57:08,018 --> 00:57:17,929
global photosynthesis and somewhat up

1034
00:57:12,429 --> 00:57:24,489
there thank you very much

1035
00:57:17,929 --> 00:57:24,489
[Applause]

1036
00:57:31,338 --> 00:57:39,420
yeah actually the oceans are easier

1037
00:57:35,719 --> 00:57:43,189
because there's no no substantial

1038
00:57:39,420 --> 00:57:45,990
reflectance in the near-infrared so

1039
00:57:43,190 --> 00:57:51,298
they've been using it for some time to

1040
00:57:45,989 --> 00:57:54,000
do fluorescence the biggest most of the

1041
00:57:51,298 --> 00:57:57,298
work has been done looking at things

1042
00:57:54,000 --> 00:58:00,239
like nutrient limitation there's a new

1043
00:57:57,298 --> 00:58:03,719
satellite that has just come online

1044
00:58:00,239 --> 00:58:08,129
called Romi that allows you to do red

1045
00:58:03,719 --> 00:58:09,959
fluorescence red light gets out of the

1046
00:58:08,130 --> 00:58:12,000
ocean the near-infrared light that we're

1047
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:19,380
working with the ocean is black in that

1048
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:23,190
range so you can see coastal blooms and

1049
00:58:19,380 --> 00:58:25,559
things like that we haven't worked very

1050
00:58:23,190 --> 00:58:34,740
much with that at this point but I think

1051
00:58:25,559 --> 00:58:38,519
it's going to be useful any effect of

1052
00:58:34,739 --> 00:58:41,239
the polarization of skylight changes

1053
00:58:38,519 --> 00:58:41,239
during the day

1054
00:58:43,250 --> 00:58:52,730
yeah well certainly the reflectance

1055
00:58:47,010 --> 00:58:55,230
remote sensing is it is there there are

1056
00:58:52,730 --> 00:58:58,760
there have been satellites put up to

1057
00:58:55,230 --> 00:59:02,568
look at polarization of the light I

1058
00:58:58,760 --> 00:59:10,500
there's all also in effect I mean the

1059
00:59:02,568 --> 00:59:14,880
the specular reflectance off of the

1060
00:59:10,500 --> 00:59:16,710
leaves is polarized so you know if light

1061
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:18,298
strikes the epidermis and then it's

1062
00:59:16,710 --> 00:59:21,210
reflected back like a mirror

1063
00:59:18,298 --> 00:59:25,829
that's for reflectance a real problem

1064
00:59:21,210 --> 00:59:28,470
because it doesn't carry the this signal

1065
00:59:25,829 --> 00:59:30,990
of the vegetation and they've been able

1066
00:59:28,469 --> 00:59:32,019
to eliminate that bipolar by looking at

1067
00:59:30,989 --> 00:59:35,500
the polarization

1068
00:59:32,019 --> 00:59:40,059
there is also the satellite that

1069
00:59:35,500 --> 00:59:45,000
measures the oco-2 satellite it changes

1070
00:59:40,059 --> 00:59:49,000
its orientation as it goes through the

1071
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:52,539
from north to south from pole to pole

1072
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:55,300
and because of polarization and I don't

1073
00:59:52,539 --> 01:00:01,500
understand the spectroscopy of that

1074
00:59:55,300 --> 01:00:04,840
maybe maybe you do they do that they

1075
01:00:01,500 --> 01:00:09,250
rotate the position of the slit because

1076
01:00:04,840 --> 01:00:10,720
of the polarization effect so it is it

1077
01:00:09,250 --> 01:00:18,099
is important but I don't I don't

1078
01:00:10,719 --> 01:00:23,349
understand yeah with a region that has

1079
01:00:18,099 --> 01:00:35,170
water limitation throat or so I assume

1080
01:00:23,349 --> 01:00:40,989
aids close to 2 into believe how well if

1081
01:00:35,170 --> 01:00:43,440
they I know we we don't have an awful

1082
01:00:40,989 --> 01:00:46,959
lot of measurements where we have

1083
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:49,840
regulated control of water availability

1084
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:55,599
at this point we we have drought

1085
01:00:49,840 --> 01:00:57,850
episodes what we see is that droughts

1086
01:00:55,599 --> 01:01:04,239
almost invariably result in lower

1087
01:00:57,849 --> 01:01:07,630
fluorescence all right it could be we

1088
01:01:04,239 --> 01:01:14,019
see that droughts and leaves have less

1089
01:01:07,630 --> 01:01:15,670
fluorescence but not a huge effect it

1090
01:01:14,019 --> 01:01:23,400
could be that there is an additional

1091
01:01:15,670 --> 01:01:26,380
effect due to leaf dropping leaf curling

1092
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:30,460
leaf obsession and things like that that

1093
01:01:26,380 --> 01:01:33,670
happened consistent or simultaneously

1094
01:01:30,460 --> 01:01:37,929
with the drought which interesting also

1095
01:01:33,670 --> 01:01:41,108
has to do with just shedding light just

1096
01:01:37,929 --> 01:01:43,549
as the the the non photochemical

1097
01:01:41,108 --> 01:01:47,199
quenching does the plan

1098
01:01:43,550 --> 01:01:50,570
so responding to drought by absorbing

1099
01:01:47,199 --> 01:01:52,639
less light and letting less of that

1100
01:01:50,570 --> 01:01:55,580
light get to the reaction centers

1101
01:01:52,639 --> 01:01:59,359
because it's then because of the

1102
01:01:55,579 --> 01:02:20,150
limitation of water become less able to

1103
01:01:59,360 --> 01:02:24,550
use that light chemistry it's a really

1104
01:02:20,150 --> 01:02:30,619
good question i1 what you tend to see

1105
01:02:24,550 --> 01:02:34,400
and you we'd have to look for for small

1106
01:02:30,619 --> 01:02:37,009
areas that are I think there are some

1107
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:38,960
sites that are in the Corn Belt but in

1108
01:02:37,010 --> 01:02:40,370
forests for example that we could look

1109
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:44,690
at and figure that out

1110
01:02:40,369 --> 01:02:48,349
my my expectation is that the whole

1111
01:02:44,690 --> 01:02:51,139
thing is pretty much limited by the the

1112
01:02:48,349 --> 01:02:54,049
season and the environment and but

1113
01:02:51,139 --> 01:02:56,809
that's for crops the productivity is

1114
01:02:54,050 --> 01:02:59,300
squished into a very narrow window and

1115
01:02:56,809 --> 01:03:01,429
for forests it kind of gets spread out

1116
01:02:59,300 --> 01:03:04,460
and I wouldn't be surprised if they tend

1117
01:03:01,429 --> 01:03:06,500
to be more the same if you add it all up

1118
01:03:04,460 --> 01:03:18,619
over the year but I don't have a good

1119
01:03:06,500 --> 01:03:22,039
answer yeah to use this yeah well we you

1120
01:03:18,619 --> 01:03:25,159
see a very substantial change in the

1121
01:03:22,039 --> 01:03:27,440
reflectance of the planet in these

1122
01:03:25,159 --> 01:03:31,759
visible wavelengths visible and

1123
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:37,809
near-infrared wavelengths I it's been

1124
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:40,070
suggested as a way of looking for for

1125
01:03:37,809 --> 01:03:44,150
photosynthetic pigments on other planets

1126
01:03:40,070 --> 01:03:46,670
I think the more likely way that we'll

1127
01:03:44,150 --> 01:03:49,849
get to that in the near future is

1128
01:03:46,670 --> 01:03:52,610
looking at the light that's that gets

1129
01:03:49,849 --> 01:03:56,889
through the atmosphere as the planet

1130
01:03:52,610 --> 01:04:00,519
transits across the star but

1131
01:03:56,889 --> 01:04:14,170
yeah I think it's worth a shot certainly

1132
01:04:00,518 --> 01:04:17,018
worth thinking about yes that's a good

1133
01:04:14,170 --> 01:04:21,849
good point what we do in almost all of

1134
01:04:17,018 --> 01:04:24,699
our models of plans of radiation

1135
01:04:21,849 --> 01:04:27,818
transport for example our system models

1136
01:04:24,699 --> 01:04:32,980
as we we have all kinds of very

1137
01:04:27,818 --> 01:04:34,900
elaborate descriptions of the water

1138
01:04:32,980 --> 01:04:39,099
relations and the physiology of the

1139
01:04:34,900 --> 01:04:41,230
plant and then we put in an arbitrary

1140
01:04:39,099 --> 01:04:45,220
function for the way that light is

1141
01:04:41,230 --> 01:04:50,159
absorbed by the leaves and that can be

1142
01:04:45,219 --> 01:04:53,108
spiracle or a rectifier but people have

1143
01:04:50,159 --> 01:04:58,318
avoided dealing with the explicit

1144
01:04:53,108 --> 01:05:01,509
radiative transport of the canopies and

1145
01:04:58,318 --> 01:05:04,058
our work is saying that that is really

1146
01:05:01,509 --> 01:05:06,130
important and we aren't going to get

1147
01:05:04,059 --> 01:05:09,730
photosynthesis right until we do that

1148
01:05:06,130 --> 01:05:12,789
and how and understand how that relates

1149
01:05:09,730 --> 01:05:17,769
to how enzymatic capacity is also

1150
01:05:12,789 --> 01:05:19,839
distributed among those leaves so yeah

1151
01:05:17,768 --> 01:05:22,838
and the other thing that's I think

1152
01:05:19,838 --> 01:05:25,619
really interesting about this is that

1153
01:05:22,838 --> 01:05:27,880
the work kind of suggests that

1154
01:05:25,619 --> 01:05:32,108
photosynthesis isn't that strongly

1155
01:05:27,880 --> 01:05:34,599
limited by physiology it's more limited

1156
01:05:32,108 --> 01:05:36,759
by the amount of canopy and the

1157
01:05:34,599 --> 01:05:39,009
structure of the canopy that's made and

1158
01:05:36,759 --> 01:05:44,130
we're not dealing with that at all

1159
01:05:39,009 --> 01:05:46,269
in modeling or in modeling newer systems

1160
01:05:44,130 --> 01:05:58,509
so that's that's what I mean by it's

1161
01:05:46,268 --> 01:06:00,518
wrong it's wrong to say no but everybody

1162
01:05:58,509 --> 01:06:03,190
tacit assumptions about the nature of

1163
01:06:00,518 --> 01:06:06,129
the photon itself or the nature of light

1164
01:06:03,190 --> 01:06:10,750
itself in coming up with your models

1165
01:06:06,130 --> 01:06:16,119
I well probably we have but a and and

1166
01:06:10,750 --> 01:06:18,130
this whole thing about they the thing on

1167
01:06:16,119 --> 01:06:19,539
the Sun and they linking to the

1168
01:06:18,130 --> 01:06:20,440
chlorophyll that that sort of thing it's

1169
01:06:19,539 --> 01:06:23,619
something I made up

1170
01:06:20,440 --> 01:06:25,659
just recently all right and I've ordered

1171
01:06:23,619 --> 01:06:27,700
a couple of physicists asked you know

1172
01:06:25,659 --> 01:06:30,038
it's this really off-the-wall or it's

1173
01:06:27,699 --> 01:06:32,949
about weight weighted way to explain it

1174
01:06:30,039 --> 01:06:36,519
and they said yeah I don't like the you

1175
01:06:32,949 --> 01:06:48,268
know the vocabulary using but it seems

1176
01:06:36,518 --> 01:06:48,268
about right but if it would be yeah good

1177
01:06:48,789 --> 01:06:53,090
