1
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:17,000
full of other people who might want to

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
vote

3
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:34,480
close that poll and we'll move to the

4
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,479
last

5
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,119
question

6
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,600
very crop most most able to use higher

7
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:47,599
rates of nitrogen

8
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:52,840
is but um

9
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:25,759
all right we've got about 11

10
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,799
folks voting thank you very much

11
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:28,799
and now

12
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:31,920
we will move into the presentation

13
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:31,920
portion of the

14
00:01:32,078 --> 00:01:35,919
the class of the webcast

15
00:01:34,239 --> 00:01:37,199
and i want to introduce i don't really

16
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,400
think he needs too much of an

17
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,960
introduction

18
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:44,640
dr marvin pritz who is the small fruit

19
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:46,639
specialist um at cornell university

20
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,478
he is also the horticulture department

21
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:51,200
chairman and um

22
00:01:48,478 --> 00:01:53,679
has also this is his second webcast of

23
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:56,240
this serie series but nutrient

24
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:58,960
management and berry crops and

25
00:01:56,239 --> 00:02:00,718
thank you everybody and marvin

26
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:02,478
take it from here

27
00:02:00,718 --> 00:02:05,599
okay and thanks everyone for joining

28
00:02:02,478 --> 00:02:07,359
this is great what a convenient way to

29
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:08,639
be in touch with everyone

30
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:10,399
so we want to talk about nutrient

31
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:11,598
management vary crops and of course our

32
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:12,479
challenge is

33
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:14,079
the

34
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:15,199
diversity of berry crops that we have

35
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,520
out there

36
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:19,119
and each one requires some specificity

37
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,800
in terms of its nutrient needs but what

38
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,878
we're going to do is try to focus on

39
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,560
some general principles instead and

40
00:02:22,878 --> 00:02:26,399
probably one principle that cuts across

41
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,239
all these berry crops in terms of

42
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,520
nutrient management are

43
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:31,840
first

44
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,840
get a soil test prior to planting you've

45
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:36,959
all heard this before but that allows us

46
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:39,519
to adjust the ph and our nutrient levels

47
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:41,598
and then for perennial fruit crops once

48
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:43,680
the plants are growing in the ground a

49
00:02:41,598 --> 00:02:46,560
leaf analysis is usually the best way to

50
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,920
fine tune your fertilization program

51
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,479
and if you followed the soil test

52
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:52,719
correctly and got the ph right

53
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:54,719
and got the nutrient levels right

54
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:57,598
at least for the first five or six years

55
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:58,959
you may not have to do anything

56
00:02:57,598 --> 00:03:00,878
in terms of fertilizer application

57
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:02,640
except for maybe nitrogen

58
00:03:00,878 --> 00:03:04,318
but hopefully if you've done it right

59
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:06,399
and put those nutrients into the soil

60
00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:07,839
before you plant you can have that long

61
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:10,640
of a time before you have to go in and

62
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,840
start fine tuning and for most very

63
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:13,518
crops

64
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,039
you might be ready to replant by that

65
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:16,319
time anyway

66
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:19,120
so these are the two overriding

67
00:03:16,318 --> 00:03:21,199
principles for all of it

68
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,640
what happens if you don't

69
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:25,039
follow that test

70
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:26,719
and then you find out later oh my soil

71
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:28,000
ph is too low and i have to add some

72
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:29,840
lime and where to get those plants

73
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,158
growing well you end up with kind of a

74
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:34,158
mess because you're putting lime over

75
00:03:32,158 --> 00:03:35,840
top of the planting and it doesn't

76
00:03:34,158 --> 00:03:36,639
really work its way into the ground very

77
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,039
well

78
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:41,119
and it blows around and it's always best

79
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:43,280
to do that before you plant so you don't

80
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,280
end up trying to apply lime after the

81
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:47,919
plants are in the ground

82
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:50,158
so soil testing is real good

83
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:52,238
and then once the plants are growing we

84
00:03:50,158 --> 00:03:53,519
can take leaves from those plants in the

85
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:55,680
middle of summer

86
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:57,280
after things are sort of stabilized

87
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,200
and look at the nutrients in those

88
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,438
leaves and we can tell whether they're

89
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:03,359
in the adequate range and if they're not

90
00:04:01,438 --> 00:04:05,039
we can make a recommendation on how to

91
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:07,200
make that adjustment

92
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:08,318
and both of these tests it can be done

93
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:10,238
at cornell they can be done through

94
00:04:08,318 --> 00:04:11,759
private labs

95
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:13,759
but the point is

96
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:15,199
using the nutrient analysis after the

97
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:16,319
plants underground is the best way we

98
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:17,759
can tell

99
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:19,358
what to do with your plants and give

100
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:21,919
recommendations

101
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:22,638
these standard fuller nutrient ranges

102
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:24,959
are

103
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:25,918
good only if the soil ph is in the right

104
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:28,879
range

105
00:04:25,918 --> 00:04:30,560
if the soil ph is off then these values

106
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:32,079
all become off and it doesn't do any

107
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:35,199
good to play around with

108
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:37,519
potassium or calcium or boron

109
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,879
if the basic problem is the ph is too

110
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:40,319
high or too low

111
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:43,360
so if you know your ph is in the right

112
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:46,240
range then rely on the leaf analysis for

113
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:48,479
modifications

114
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,560
and each of those leaf analyses are

115
00:04:48,478 --> 00:04:51,839
they're specific for different crops so

116
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,120
the blueberry one will be different than

117
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:55,599
the strawberry one will be different

118
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,680
than a raspberry one

119
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,960
what i want to talk about though are

120
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,519
some of the specific nutrient

121
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:02,560
requirements uh for in this case

122
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:04,560
blueberries we'll start off with

123
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:06,160
blueberries because i probably got a lot

124
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,839
of questions about that and indeed one

125
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:10,320
of the questions i asked

126
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:11,359
uh earlier was what's the most uh common

127
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:13,279
problem across the country with

128
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:17,038
blueberries and the answer that most of

129
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:18,959
you got was the ph being too high

130
00:05:17,038 --> 00:05:20,879
so the first thing and the most

131
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:24,719
important thing in growing blueberries

132
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:27,680
is test the soil ph and make sure it's

133
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:29,919
you bring it down to about 4.5

134
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,840
that's pretty low for most crops

135
00:05:29,918 --> 00:05:33,519
and

136
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:34,719
that usually it's going to take some

137
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:36,639
sulfur

138
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,560
and incorporate it into the soil and

139
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:40,240
letting that sulfur work for several

140
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,000
months before the site will be suitable

141
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,120
for blueberries once in a while you'll

142
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,038
find a site

143
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,319
particularly maybe down where sandy is

144
00:05:45,038 --> 00:05:47,599
on long island where the soils are

145
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:49,120
already naturally

146
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,199
low in and

147
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,399
ph you can plant blueberries directly

148
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:54,400
into that but most

149
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:57,198
soils you have to apply some sulfur to

150
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:57,198
get that to happen

151
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,720
blueberries are very slow growing it

152
00:05:59,038 --> 00:06:02,240
takes several years before they reach

153
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,520
maturity we figure about eight years

154
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,280
from the time you plant by the time

155
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:07,599
they're really full grown

156
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:08,559
they have some adaptations to these low

157
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,160
ph

158
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,079
low nutrient soils and if indeed if

159
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:14,400
you're walking through the woods and out

160
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:16,478
hiking around you will find blueberries

161
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:18,799
in sites that tend to have

162
00:06:16,478 --> 00:06:21,599
acidic sandy soils usually sometimes

163
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,639
it's wet because they can grow there

164
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,319
and

165
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:25,199
one of the adaptations that blueberries

166
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:27,199
have

167
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:29,680
is that the roots have an association

168
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:32,000
with endomycorrhizal fungi and these

169
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,199
fungi actually colonize the fine roots

170
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,439
of blueberry

171
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:37,600
and the hyphae grow out into the soil

172
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:39,199
and aid in phosphorous and nitrogen

173
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:41,360
uptake

174
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:43,360
that's not all plants have

175
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:45,360
endomycorrhizal fungi in fact just a few

176
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:48,080
do and the iricase family the

177
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:49,759
blueberries belong to is one that has

178
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:50,800
this association that allows them to

179
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:52,319
tolerate

180
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,439
soils that tend not to have a lot of

181
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:56,000
phosphorus

182
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:57,839
and where a lot of the nitrogen is in

183
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,598
the ammonium form as opposed to the

184
00:06:57,839 --> 00:07:02,239
nitrate form

185
00:06:59,598 --> 00:07:04,159
so in your garden where you have fairly

186
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:06,160
high ph and the soils are warm you don't

187
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:08,880
have a lot of water out there

188
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:10,880
the most of the nitrogen gets converted

189
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:14,478
by the soil bacteria into the nitrate

190
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:16,159
form that plants can readily take up

191
00:07:14,478 --> 00:07:18,079
you can fertilize your garden plants

192
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:20,560
with ammonium sources of fertilizer but

193
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:22,639
the bacteria convert it to nitrate and

194
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,639
then the plants take it up

195
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:27,120
blueberries have the unique ability to

196
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:30,319
take up the ammonium ion directly

197
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:33,120
which makes them really suitable for low

198
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:34,639
ph wetter cooler soils where the

199
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,800
predominant form of nitrogen is the

200
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:38,560
ammonium ion anyway

201
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,319
blueberries can also tolerate very high

202
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,560
levels of manganese

203
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:45,120
because manganese availability goes up a

204
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:47,120
lot when the soil ph drops

205
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:49,918
so if plants didn't have the ability to

206
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:51,840
tolerate that when you lower the ph

207
00:07:49,918 --> 00:07:54,000
in some soils the manganese would go so

208
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:55,359
high that would be toxic to the plant

209
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,879
but blueberries have the ability to

210
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:59,038
sequester that

211
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:01,840
manganese and vacuoles and allow plants

212
00:07:59,038 --> 00:08:03,120
to tolerate relatively high levels

213
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:04,478
and the other thing that blueberries can

214
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,918
do is they can tolerate low levels of

215
00:08:04,478 --> 00:08:08,240
calcium

216
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:09,839
and in fact high levels of calcium is

217
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:12,560
pretty detrimental to blueberries they

218
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:14,239
do not do well where the calcium in the

219
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,680
soil is over say

220
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:18,319
2 000

221
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:20,720
pounds per acre and a lot of soils have

222
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:23,120
calcium that high i've seen soils where

223
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,400
the ph is low the cat but the calcium

224
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,000
levels are high

225
00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:28,799
and the blueberries just don't do well

226
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,879
even though the ph is low that calcium

227
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,639
just doesn't help the plants for some

228
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:34,320
reason

229
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:36,958
this is a blueberry roots grown in

230
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:39,599
nitrate nitrogen and ammonium nitrogen

231
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:42,079
and you can see that

232
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:44,480
the nitrate form of nitrogen

233
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:47,278
makes the roots sort of

234
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:48,959
die it causes necrosis they do not like

235
00:08:47,278 --> 00:08:50,799
the nitrate form and nitrogen whereas

236
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:52,159
the ammonium form of nitrogen they can

237
00:08:50,799 --> 00:08:54,399
do just fine

238
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:56,079
interestingly if you did this with a

239
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:58,879
tomato or a pepper or any other

240
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:00,399
strawberry it would just be the opposite

241
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:02,080
the ammonium

242
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:04,080
force-fed plants would have black roots

243
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,120
and nitrate force-fed plants would be

244
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,879
just fine

245
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,480
blueberries are different

246
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:10,480
the other thing is that high levels of

247
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:13,200
nitrogen fertilizers are detrimental to

248
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:14,639
the endomycorrhizal fungi and hence hurt

249
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,560
the blueberry plant so you don't want to

250
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:18,319
fertilize with too much nitrogen on

251
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:20,639
blueberries because it hurts the plants

252
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:22,560
and the fungal association

253
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:24,958
another thing that hurts the plants is

254
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:27,278
too much chloride

255
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:29,518
and if you fertilize with potassium

256
00:09:27,278 --> 00:09:31,360
chloride or murieta potash

257
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:33,839
you may be applying too much chloride so

258
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:36,240
on blueberry plants we recommend if you

259
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:38,480
have to apply potassium to apply

260
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:40,720
potassium sulfate

261
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:42,639
that's a lot safer to use than potassium

262
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:46,720
chloride around blueberries more

263
00:09:42,639 --> 00:09:46,720
expensive but it's safer to use

264
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,720
so how do we manage blueberries so i put

265
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:53,600
this all together well we pick a site

266
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:55,920
with adequate pore space in the soil

267
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:58,639
select a site with low calcium

268
00:09:55,919 --> 00:10:00,079
ideally less than 1800 pounds per acre

269
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:01,919
of calcium

270
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:03,920
high organic matter is really important

271
00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:07,199
for blueberries they don't do well when

272
00:10:03,919 --> 00:10:07,199
the organic matter is low

273
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:10,879
the lower the ph

274
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,320
usually the better and you can lower

275
00:10:10,879 --> 00:10:15,600
that with sulfur until you get down

276
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,600
around 4.5

277
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:22,319
under low nutrient condition under low

278
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:24,480
ph conditions sometimes

279
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:26,640
magnesium becomes unavailable so

280
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:28,480
sometimes you have to apply supplemental

281
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:30,958
magnesium in order

282
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:33,839
to compensate for the lower ph

283
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:36,639
but rarely any others

284
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:38,240
usually in your pre plant soil tests

285
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:40,000
you know you might not have to ever

286
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:42,000
apply phosphorus because blueberries are

287
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,958
really good at sequestering phosphorus

288
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,559
such as endomycorrhizal fungi

289
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:48,159
the organic matter

290
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:49,919
that you want to have is you know the

291
00:10:48,159 --> 00:10:52,559
more the better uh you can grow

292
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:54,639
blueberries on mux soils but ideally if

293
00:10:52,559 --> 00:10:56,078
you have you know four to six percent

294
00:10:54,639 --> 00:10:59,199
that would be good it also helps to

295
00:10:56,078 --> 00:11:01,278
buffer against that ph requirement

296
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:03,040
so in a say a sandy soil with very

297
00:11:01,278 --> 00:11:05,919
little organic matter you've got to be

298
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:08,159
right about 4.5 ph

299
00:11:05,919 --> 00:11:09,679
on a sandy soil with a lot of organic

300
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:12,000
matter you can cheat a little bit you

301
00:11:09,679 --> 00:11:14,799
might not have to go much below five

302
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:17,039
and so it just provides a a buffer for

303
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:17,039
that

304
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:22,480
and then

305
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:24,160
mulching with sawdust and wood chips to

306
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:25,519
maintain the organic matter and moisture

307
00:11:24,159 --> 00:11:27,679
in the soil

308
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:31,200
when you fertilize blueberries

309
00:11:27,679 --> 00:11:32,958
we recommend ammonium sulfate or urea

310
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:35,200
as opposed to other sources of

311
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:37,199
fertilizer that might contain nitrates

312
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:39,200
because again the nitrates are toxic to

313
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:42,240
the blueberry roots but ammonium sulfate

314
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:44,000
is perfect blueberries really like that

315
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,360
and you apply increasing amounts as a

316
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,559
plant ages

317
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:49,039
up to about

318
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:51,599
65 pounds per acre so

319
00:11:49,039 --> 00:11:54,159
none the first year maybe 10 pounds the

320
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:56,959
next year per acre and then 20 30 40 all

321
00:11:54,159 --> 00:11:59,199
the way up until you have about 65-70

322
00:11:56,958 --> 00:12:01,359
pounds on a bush that might be seven or

323
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:03,440
eight years old

324
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:05,680
workout michigan has found that uptake

325
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:07,680
is much more efficient if you split the

326
00:12:05,679 --> 00:12:10,000
application between bloom

327
00:12:07,679 --> 00:12:12,399
and then six weeks later we used to

328
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,759
recommend putting all the nitrogen down

329
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:15,440
in april

330
00:12:13,759 --> 00:12:18,399
but now we've found that it's much more

331
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:20,560
efficient to put it on probably in may

332
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:22,159
when they first bloom and then six weeks

333
00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:24,239
later the problem with putting it down

334
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:26,078
in april was that the roots were not

335
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:28,320
active at that time and a lot of that

336
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:30,078
nitrogen was leaching before the roots

337
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,519
had a chance to take it up

338
00:12:30,078 --> 00:12:32,479
so you need to wait until the roots are

339
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:35,759
warm

340
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:38,000
and then put it on a split application

341
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:39,838
also if you are using lots of mulch you

342
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,958
may have to increase the rate above that

343
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:45,040
65 pounds per acre to compensate

344
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:46,958
for the the mulch which tends to tie up

345
00:12:45,039 --> 00:12:48,480
some of the nitrogen

346
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:50,399
here's a blueberry plant on the left

347
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:53,600
hand side you can see a plant with

348
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:55,519
adequate nitrogen and one over here with

349
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:58,240
inadequate you just look at the plant

350
00:12:55,519 --> 00:13:00,000
just not nearly as green

351
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:02,480
and that's the symptoms of too low

352
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,480
nitrogen

353
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:08,879
this is magnesium deficiency and it's

354
00:13:06,559 --> 00:13:11,679
fairly common in new york and the reason

355
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:13,919
for that is as a ph drops the

356
00:13:11,679 --> 00:13:15,439
availability of magnesium also drops and

357
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:17,278
sometimes you can get in a situation

358
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:19,600
where yeah you got to have the ph low

359
00:13:17,278 --> 00:13:21,278
but it also makes the magnesium

360
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:23,920
unavailable

361
00:13:21,278 --> 00:13:26,799
and you may have to add some epsom salts

362
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:28,240
which is magnesium sulfate to build that

363
00:13:26,799 --> 00:13:30,399
back up

364
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:32,079
and this is a symptom that you might get

365
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:33,519
when magnesium is low it's pretty

366
00:13:32,078 --> 00:13:36,559
distinctive they call it sort of a

367
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:38,399
christmas tree pattern where you get red

368
00:13:36,559 --> 00:13:39,838
colors between the veins and the veins

369
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:40,799
themselves stay

370
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:42,160
green

371
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:44,000
so that's real characteristic of

372
00:13:42,159 --> 00:13:45,439
magnesium deficiency

373
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,278
and essentially what's going on within

374
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:50,480
the plant is the plant isn't able to

375
00:13:47,278 --> 00:13:52,720
make chlorophyll at that level it needs

376
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:53,680
so the chlorophyll disappears there

377
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,879
isn't

378
00:13:53,679 --> 00:13:57,120
there isn't as much of that and the

379
00:13:54,879 --> 00:13:59,120
other pigments in the leaf start to show

380
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,720
up so you almost get the fall colors

381
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,320
maybe in the middle of summer showing up

382
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:06,639
because there's not enough chlorophyll

383
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:06,639
to mask the other anthocyanins

384
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:12,240
having a high ph

385
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,839
is the most common problem across the

386
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:16,399
country with blueberries

387
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:18,720
and the symptom of high ph is what we

388
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:20,078
call iron chlorosis

389
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,000
and this is

390
00:14:20,078 --> 00:14:24,239
similar to what you saw with magnesium

391
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:28,000
deficiency except in this case it's iron

392
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:30,480
deficiency the leaves turn yellow

393
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:33,039
instead of red and again it has to do

394
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:35,120
with the pigments that are manufactured

395
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:36,319
and are expressed when the iron isn't

396
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,919
available

397
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:40,800
now interestingly enough

398
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:42,719
iron is one of the most common elements

399
00:14:40,799 --> 00:14:44,479
in the earth's crust there's usually

400
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,399
lots of iron in the soil

401
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:48,720
the plant just isn't able to take it up

402
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:50,559
if the ph is too high

403
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,959
so you could add all the iron you want

404
00:14:50,559 --> 00:14:55,518
to the soil but if the ph is too high

405
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:57,679
the plants are still going to be yellow

406
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:58,480
so two things you can do one is you can

407
00:14:57,679 --> 00:15:01,359
spray

408
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:02,720
iron chelate on the leaves and sort of

409
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,919
foliar feed some iron and that will

410
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:06,240
green up the plants but that's only

411
00:15:03,919 --> 00:15:09,198
temporary the solution to this problem

412
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:11,440
is a reduction in the soil ph so once

413
00:15:09,198 --> 00:15:14,000
you lower the ph then the iron can

414
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:15,680
become in its active form and be taken

415
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,440
into the plant and used to manufacture

416
00:15:15,679 --> 00:15:20,958
chlorophyll and other pigments that will

417
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,959
turn the leaves green again

418
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,959
another deficiency that we sometimes see

419
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:28,000
on blueberries particularly in sandy

420
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:30,479
soils is potassium

421
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,480
and again it creates a distinctive

422
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:34,399
symptom of this marginal burning it

423
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:36,800
looks like maybe the plants didn't get

424
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:38,399
watered and they dried out

425
00:15:36,799 --> 00:15:40,319
and kind of that's what's happening

426
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:42,639
physiologically potassium is used to

427
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:44,800
help transport water through the plant

428
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:46,320
without potassium you don't have stomata

429
00:15:44,799 --> 00:15:48,078
open and closing properly and you get

430
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:50,240
this burning

431
00:15:48,078 --> 00:15:51,758
so if the potassium is low even though

432
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:54,159
you have adequate irrigation adequate

433
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:55,440
water you still might get this symptom

434
00:15:54,159 --> 00:15:56,958
and i've seen this

435
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:59,600
i'm not so much in new york but i have

436
00:15:56,958 --> 00:16:02,958
seen it in new jersey

437
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,959
but it's just something to watch out for

438
00:16:05,679 --> 00:16:10,399
boron is a nutrient is relatively

439
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:12,399
commonly deficient in our soils in the

440
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:14,240
northeast and we see symptoms of boron

441
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:15,198
deficiency

442
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,480
a lot

443
00:16:15,198 --> 00:16:18,879
and this is a

444
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:19,680
boron deficient blueberry plant

445
00:16:18,879 --> 00:16:21,439
and

446
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:23,039
the grower thought this was winter

447
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:25,120
injury and indeed it looks very much

448
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:27,599
like winter injury we couldn't find any

449
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:29,278
pathogen on there it wasn't a canker

450
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,399
but it assumed it was winter injury even

451
00:16:29,278 --> 00:16:32,879
though

452
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:34,799
the winters weren't that cold and

453
00:16:32,879 --> 00:16:37,759
anyway bottom line is we did foliar

454
00:16:34,799 --> 00:16:39,838
analysis boron tested out really low

455
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:43,278
and they applied a couple of pounds of

456
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:44,320
boron per acre and the problem went away

457
00:16:43,278 --> 00:16:46,320
that's what it looks like on blueberry

458
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:49,519
we'll see in a few minutes some more

459
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:50,879
distinctive symptoms on strawberry

460
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:53,039
this is a healthy

461
00:16:50,879 --> 00:16:55,679
blueberry filled what you like to see

462
00:16:53,039 --> 00:16:56,879
grass between the rose straw mulch

463
00:16:55,679 --> 00:17:00,078
and

464
00:16:56,879 --> 00:17:00,078
vigorously growing plants

465
00:17:01,679 --> 00:17:06,240
let's shift to strawberries for a minute

466
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:08,880
completely different plant not a woody

467
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:12,798
plant it's a herbaceous perennial

468
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:14,160
and it has a target ph of about 6 to 6.5

469
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:16,000
for making adjustments so for

470
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:17,360
strawberries growers aren't adding

471
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,679
sulfur to the soil they're generally

472
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:22,798
adding lime to bring the ph up a little

473
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:24,480
bit so it's in the adequate range

474
00:17:22,798 --> 00:17:26,240
now strawberries are grown as either

475
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,599
annuals or perennials depending on what

476
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,960
part of the country you're from some

477
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:30,558
parts of the country you know people are

478
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:32,079
doing both

479
00:17:30,558 --> 00:17:34,399
some people in new york are playing

480
00:17:32,079 --> 00:17:36,399
around with annual strawberry production

481
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:39,679
and in practice some growers apply up to

482
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:41,600
400 pounds per acre of actual nitrogen

483
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:43,280
sprouted over the season but

484
00:17:41,599 --> 00:17:46,079
data show that strawberry plants can

485
00:17:43,279 --> 00:17:47,918
only use about 100 pounds

486
00:17:46,079 --> 00:17:49,839
that they can take up so

487
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:52,320
in many annual systems 300 pounds is

488
00:17:49,839 --> 00:17:53,759
just being wasted just being washed

489
00:17:52,319 --> 00:17:55,119
through the soil profile and into the

490
00:17:53,759 --> 00:17:56,720
groundwater

491
00:17:55,119 --> 00:17:58,959
strawberries are very inefficient at

492
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:01,120
sequestering nitrogen the root systems

493
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:02,240
are somewhat shallow they're not very

494
00:18:01,119 --> 00:18:04,399
extensive

495
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:06,480
and so you have to really spoon feed

496
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:08,320
strawberries nitrogen and you can't

497
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:10,720
expect them to take a lot of it out of

498
00:18:08,319 --> 00:18:12,480
the soil

499
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:15,519
we grow strawberries in new york mostly

500
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:17,440
as perennials and

501
00:18:15,519 --> 00:18:19,200
most of the growth of a strawberry in

502
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:21,120
our system occurs in early spring right

503
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:23,200
after we take the mulch off

504
00:18:21,119 --> 00:18:25,199
and that's when carbon and nitrogen can

505
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:27,279
be limiting because the plants have been

506
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:30,480
under the mulch all winter long they've

507
00:18:27,279 --> 00:18:33,038
they've used up all their carbon

508
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:36,720
just during the process of respiration

509
00:18:33,038 --> 00:18:37,759
the nitrogen was used up last spring and

510
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:40,000
fall

511
00:18:37,759 --> 00:18:42,079
and now they're deficient in both you

512
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:45,839
take the mulch off and they need to put

513
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:47,199
on this really fast growth spurt

514
00:18:45,839 --> 00:18:48,959
these are some data

515
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:51,120
of strawberries

516
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:53,200
in the planning year planting them in

517
00:18:51,119 --> 00:18:55,918
july you can see how the strawberry

518
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:57,440
plant grows kind of slowly it slows down

519
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:59,759
in the fall then we go through the

520
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:02,320
winter it loses some biomass during the

521
00:18:59,759 --> 00:19:05,359
winter and the next spring it just

522
00:19:02,319 --> 00:19:05,359
really takes off

523
00:19:08,319 --> 00:19:11,599
push of growth at that time

524
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:14,240
so

525
00:19:11,599 --> 00:19:15,759
logic would have it that well we ought

526
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:18,000
to be fertilizing our strawberries right

527
00:19:15,759 --> 00:19:19,440
about here because that's right before

528
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,679
the big growth spurt and the plants need

529
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:23,840
a lot of nitrogen and

530
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:25,600
carbohydrate then to sustain itself

531
00:19:23,839 --> 00:19:27,119
during this rapid growth spurt when it's

532
00:19:25,599 --> 00:19:30,399
fruiting

533
00:19:27,119 --> 00:19:31,918
but in actual aldi we've done studies

534
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,038
that show that those spring nitrogen

535
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:35,360
rates

536
00:19:33,038 --> 00:19:37,919
make the fruit really soft

537
00:19:35,359 --> 00:19:39,359
and increases our botrytis incidence we

538
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:41,440
did this for three years in a row and

539
00:19:39,359 --> 00:19:43,359
every year we got the same results

540
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:45,759
anything more than about 30 pounds of

541
00:19:43,359 --> 00:19:47,519
actual nitrogen per acre really softened

542
00:19:45,759 --> 00:19:48,319
the fruit

543
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:49,918
so

544
00:19:48,319 --> 00:19:51,599
if spring's kind of out because it

545
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:54,559
softens the fruit you know when when

546
00:19:51,599 --> 00:19:57,279
should we fertilize strawberries

547
00:19:54,558 --> 00:19:59,279
and the answer seems to be

548
00:19:57,279 --> 00:20:01,839
immediately after harvest in july so you

549
00:19:59,279 --> 00:20:04,399
wait until that fruit comes off then

550
00:20:01,839 --> 00:20:06,079
put down some of your fertilizer

551
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,759
but we don't want to put it all down

552
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:09,359
then because strawberries aren't

553
00:20:07,759 --> 00:20:11,038
efficient at taking up nitrogen from the

554
00:20:09,359 --> 00:20:13,759
soil so we put maybe

555
00:20:11,038 --> 00:20:14,960
two-thirds of it on after harvest

556
00:20:13,759 --> 00:20:17,759
and then another

557
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:19,519
third of it on in early september

558
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:21,359
prior to flower blood formation that

559
00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:23,359
seems to be the best timing

560
00:20:21,359 --> 00:20:24,558
the roots are active they're taking it

561
00:20:23,359 --> 00:20:25,678
up

562
00:20:24,558 --> 00:20:27,279
and you

563
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:28,080
spoon feed them a little bit during that

564
00:20:27,279 --> 00:20:30,240
time

565
00:20:28,079 --> 00:20:31,439
we also have done some research to show

566
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:34,000
that fall

567
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:35,200
foliar fertilization helps strawberries

568
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,279
as well it seems to increase the

569
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:38,880
nitrogen reserves just before the plant

570
00:20:37,279 --> 00:20:42,079
goes into the winter

571
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:44,000
if you put fall fuller applications on

572
00:20:42,079 --> 00:20:46,000
during the summer it stimulates

573
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,640
vegetative growth and the plants grow

574
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,839
more but it doesn't result in more

575
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,520
yields

576
00:20:49,839 --> 00:20:53,359
it seems like if you wait until after

577
00:20:51,519 --> 00:20:54,879
growth is over

578
00:20:53,359 --> 00:20:56,879
and then you put the fall folder

579
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:59,120
fertilization on like october early

580
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:01,440
october the strawberry plant takes up

581
00:20:59,119 --> 00:21:02,879
that nitrogen

582
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:04,080
but it's not going to grow anymore

583
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:06,720
because it's too cold and the daylight

584
00:21:04,079 --> 00:21:08,960
is short and that nitrogen actually goes

585
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:11,120
into the reserve pools of nitrogen and

586
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:13,200
then is available for the following

587
00:21:11,119 --> 00:21:17,119
spring

588
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:20,400
we found that five pounds of foliar

589
00:21:17,119 --> 00:21:23,119
urea actually nitrogen as full urea in

590
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:26,159
the fall gives us as big of a yolk kick

591
00:21:23,119 --> 00:21:27,839
as maybe 30 pounds the following spring

592
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:30,480
so it's a very efficient time to put on

593
00:21:27,839 --> 00:21:32,000
a foliar spray

594
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:33,519
these are some data

595
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,720
sort of hot off the press from a study

596
00:21:33,519 --> 00:21:37,038
that we did on

597
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:40,558
fertilizing strawberries

598
00:21:37,038 --> 00:21:40,558
on this axis let's see

599
00:21:41,119 --> 00:21:45,759
this axis here we have increasing rates

600
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:48,079
of fertilizer so we grew the plants with

601
00:21:45,759 --> 00:21:49,839
increasing rates of fertilizer and then

602
00:21:48,079 --> 00:21:51,918
here we looked at how much nitrogen was

603
00:21:49,839 --> 00:21:53,439
in the plant and i mean no surprise we

604
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:55,600
fertilize more

605
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:57,519
and we get more fertilizer in the plant

606
00:21:55,599 --> 00:21:59,439
more nitrogen in the plant

607
00:21:57,519 --> 00:22:01,440
but with just a little bit of fall

608
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:02,720
fertilizer as well fuller fertilizer we

609
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:04,320
can increase the amount of nitrogen

610
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:05,919
plant quite a bit

611
00:22:04,319 --> 00:22:09,200
by just putting on a couple of

612
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:09,200
applications in october

613
00:22:09,519 --> 00:22:14,798
trade-off you make when you do that is

614
00:22:12,319 --> 00:22:18,240
that you actually decrease your

615
00:22:14,798 --> 00:22:20,558
carbohydrate this number this is total

616
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:23,038
non-structural carbohydrate so as you

617
00:22:20,558 --> 00:22:25,678
increase your nitrogen

618
00:22:23,038 --> 00:22:28,240
your carbohydrate levels go down and

619
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:30,798
particularly when we increase nitrogen

620
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:32,000
from fall foliar fertilizer this is a

621
00:22:30,798 --> 00:22:34,879
good way of getting nitrogen to the

622
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,558
plant it decreases your carbohydrates

623
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:38,320
now that's not a problem as long as you

624
00:22:36,558 --> 00:22:40,319
have adequate carbohydrate but if you

625
00:22:38,319 --> 00:22:43,279
don't have enough carbohydrate you can

626
00:22:40,319 --> 00:22:45,839
actually see your yields decreasing

627
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:48,000
so in this graph here

628
00:22:45,839 --> 00:22:49,839
we've increased our nitrogen without

629
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,839
fall foliar application as we increased

630
00:22:49,839 --> 00:22:53,759
our nitrogen our yields go up the

631
00:22:51,839 --> 00:22:54,798
following year and that's what we would

632
00:22:53,759 --> 00:22:55,679
expect

633
00:22:54,798 --> 00:22:57,119
but

634
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:59,840
if we

635
00:22:57,119 --> 00:23:01,678
also increase nitrogen we fall

636
00:22:59,839 --> 00:23:04,158
foliar feed we can get to the point we

637
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:05,840
get so much nitrogen in the plant that

638
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:08,080
our yields no longer keep going up but

639
00:23:05,839 --> 00:23:09,678
they actually fall back down and that's

640
00:23:08,079 --> 00:23:11,279
because we're above

641
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:12,320
the optimal amount for the plant and

642
00:23:11,279 --> 00:23:13,759
we're starting to deplete our

643
00:23:12,319 --> 00:23:15,678
carbohydrates to the point where the

644
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:19,038
plant can't

645
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:21,120
sustain itself during that spring flush

646
00:23:19,038 --> 00:23:22,558
so down here we have just sort of put it

647
00:23:21,119 --> 00:23:24,399
all together looking at the total amount

648
00:23:22,558 --> 00:23:26,158
of nitrogen in the plant

649
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,759
going into the fall and looking at the

650
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:29,760
yield the following spring and we can

651
00:23:27,759 --> 00:23:32,000
see that there is an optimal point

652
00:23:29,759 --> 00:23:34,240
and it's you can exceed that

653
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,480
with high fertilizer rates

654
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:38,960
in a growing year coupled with fall

655
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,759
foliar fertilizer so you want to do too

656
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:42,079
much

657
00:23:39,759 --> 00:23:43,679
but if you're moderately fertilized

658
00:23:42,079 --> 00:23:45,918
in the growing season and then add a

659
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:47,919
little bit of fall fertilizer you can be

660
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:50,919
up in this range here which is good for

661
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:50,919
yield

662
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:57,038
here's a graph showing

663
00:23:54,079 --> 00:24:00,399
yields with fall

664
00:23:57,038 --> 00:24:00,400
fertilizer this is

665
00:24:00,558 --> 00:24:06,399
no fall foliar fertilizer and five

666
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:08,240
pounds of fall

667
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:10,480
fuller your fertilizer and you can see

668
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:12,798
our yields jump quite a bit almost to

669
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:15,278
the same level that's where we put 30

670
00:24:12,798 --> 00:24:17,278
pounds on in the springtime

671
00:24:15,278 --> 00:24:19,278
so this is what i guess six times more

672
00:24:17,278 --> 00:24:20,798
efficient and the other thing is with

673
00:24:19,278 --> 00:24:22,079
spring nitrogen we're getting softer

674
00:24:20,798 --> 00:24:24,158
fruit

675
00:24:22,079 --> 00:24:26,558
so

676
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:28,240
we want to avoid the spring if we can

677
00:24:26,558 --> 00:24:30,558
and if we want to if we don't think the

678
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:32,558
plants have adequate nitrogen

679
00:24:30,558 --> 00:24:34,960
a fall foliar application seems to be

680
00:24:32,558 --> 00:24:34,960
the best

681
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:39,440
so the goal of nitrogen fertilization in

682
00:24:37,359 --> 00:24:41,839
strawberries is to boost those nitrogen

683
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:43,278
reserves so it has them available for

684
00:24:41,839 --> 00:24:45,839
flower production and early spring

685
00:24:43,278 --> 00:24:46,880
growth so late summer soil applications

686
00:24:45,839 --> 00:24:49,759
are good

687
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:51,200
fall foliar applications are really good

688
00:24:49,759 --> 00:24:52,640
spring nitrogen

689
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,679
boosts vegetative growth a lot the

690
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:55,278
plants really grow a lot when you

691
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:56,559
fertilize in the spring

692
00:24:55,278 --> 00:24:59,038
but it doesn't have a big impact on

693
00:24:56,558 --> 00:25:00,639
yield and it seems to soften the fruit

694
00:24:59,038 --> 00:25:02,720
and then the summer foliar applications

695
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:04,480
also promotes vegetative growth doesn't

696
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:07,600
seem to translate into any yield

697
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:07,599
increase the following year

698
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:13,600
so here's that

699
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:13,600
picture i showed earlier about

700
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:18,480
strawberries ammonium forms of nitrogen

701
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:19,679
and you can see the roots are black so

702
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:22,558
this is just the opposite with

703
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:25,519
blueberries nitrate forms roots are just

704
00:25:22,558 --> 00:25:27,278
fine mixture both somewhere in between

705
00:25:25,519 --> 00:25:28,720
so if you force fetum

706
00:25:27,278 --> 00:25:30,720
ammonium this is what happens that

707
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:32,960
doesn't mean you can't use ammonium

708
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:34,079
sources of fertilizer it's just that the

709
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:36,319
ammonium

710
00:25:34,079 --> 00:25:37,519
fertilizers in the soil get converted by

711
00:25:36,319 --> 00:25:39,119
the bacteria

712
00:25:37,519 --> 00:25:40,879
into the nitrate form that the plant can

713
00:25:39,119 --> 00:25:42,959
take up so go ahead and you can use

714
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:44,720
ammonium sources of fertilizer the only

715
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:46,558
time you really want to do that is if

716
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:48,798
you fumigated the soil

717
00:25:46,558 --> 00:25:50,158
and you killed the bacteria so there was

718
00:25:48,798 --> 00:25:52,240
nothing to convert the ammonium

719
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:54,080
fertilizer to the nitrate then you might

720
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:55,599
cause some toxicity

721
00:25:54,079 --> 00:25:57,038
but in normal soils that haven't been

722
00:25:55,599 --> 00:25:58,480
fumigated

723
00:25:57,038 --> 00:26:01,839
you can use ammonium sources because

724
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:01,839
they're generally cheaper than nitrogen

725
00:26:03,278 --> 00:26:05,839
now let's look at some deficiency

726
00:26:04,558 --> 00:26:07,519
symptoms in strawberries so you can

727
00:26:05,839 --> 00:26:09,359
maybe learn to recognize

728
00:26:07,519 --> 00:26:11,359
what these plants might look like when

729
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:13,918
they're short of certain nutrients now

730
00:26:11,359 --> 00:26:15,918
again ideally with growers you would

731
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:18,400
never want to get to the state where you

732
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:20,880
see visible symptoms of deficiency you

733
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:22,559
would want to do a leaf analysis

734
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:24,960
regularly every two or three years so

735
00:26:22,558 --> 00:26:26,960
you could head off any deficiency once

736
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:29,120
you see visible symptoms then you know

737
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:31,759
you're having an impact on yields

738
00:26:29,119 --> 00:26:33,359
you want to head that off by monitoring

739
00:26:31,759 --> 00:26:34,558
plenty of time to the head

740
00:26:33,359 --> 00:26:36,639
so here's a

741
00:26:34,558 --> 00:26:38,720
nitrogen deficiency the leaves sort of

742
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:40,320
turn red this is a field of strawberries

743
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:42,240
you can see those red leaves this would

744
00:26:40,319 --> 00:26:44,319
be late july

745
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:46,640
early august way too early for leaves to

746
00:26:44,319 --> 00:26:48,399
be turning red on their own and that is

747
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:51,960
because this field was not fertilized

748
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:51,960
for a couple of years

749
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:57,440
software deficiency it's something that

750
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,600
we

751
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:01,679
don't generally see in the northeast

752
00:26:59,599 --> 00:27:04,079
because we got lots of acid rain and our

753
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:05,759
acid rain contains lots of sulfur

754
00:27:04,079 --> 00:27:07,278
and so the plants just every time it

755
00:27:05,759 --> 00:27:09,599
rains they get fertilized with sulfur so

756
00:27:07,278 --> 00:27:10,960
we tend not to see deficiency symptoms

757
00:27:09,599 --> 00:27:12,558
of sulfur

758
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:13,519
but if we did this is what it would look

759
00:27:12,558 --> 00:27:15,200
like

760
00:27:13,519 --> 00:27:17,119
sulfur is a component of a lot of amino

761
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:19,038
acids and proteins

762
00:27:17,119 --> 00:27:21,439
and nitrogen is part of amino acids so

763
00:27:19,038 --> 00:27:23,440
we don't have sulfur this nitrogen can't

764
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:25,200
be converted into amino acids and the

765
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:27,759
leaves are yellow instead of nice and

766
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,759
dark green

767
00:27:27,839 --> 00:27:31,359
okay potassium deficiency i mentioned we

768
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:33,440
see this in blueberries we sometimes see

769
00:27:31,359 --> 00:27:36,558
this in strawberries as well

770
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:37,840
particularly where we have sandier soils

771
00:27:36,558 --> 00:27:40,240
and the first thing you see with

772
00:27:37,839 --> 00:27:41,678
potassium diffusion is a little bit of

773
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:44,319
browning around the

774
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:46,320
bottom of this leaflet here

775
00:27:44,319 --> 00:27:48,879
and sometimes you can see some burning

776
00:27:46,319 --> 00:27:51,439
on the margins of the leaves and they

777
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:52,960
also get this funny color a little bit

778
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:54,798
dark

779
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:56,798
mottled throughout the leaf

780
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:58,879
from potassium look at another

781
00:27:56,798 --> 00:28:00,960
picture of this up close so you can see

782
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:03,200
the little bit of burning

783
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:04,240
along the edge of the leaf you can see a

784
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:06,720
little bit of

785
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:08,399
necrosis here where the leaflets come

786
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:10,880
and then you can see this little bit

787
00:28:08,398 --> 00:28:11,839
darker color on the leaf than what looks

788
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:14,960
normal

789
00:28:11,839 --> 00:28:17,199
so that is potassium deficiency

790
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:19,360
often with potassium deficiency you see

791
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:21,519
this on the older leaves first the same

792
00:28:19,359 --> 00:28:22,879
with nitrogen you see it on the older

793
00:28:21,519 --> 00:28:24,639
leaves first

794
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:26,480
and the reason for that is is that

795
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:28,320
potassium and nitrogen are very mobile

796
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:31,519
in the plant and they tend to be

797
00:28:28,319 --> 00:28:34,000
mobilized from the older leaves into the

798
00:28:31,519 --> 00:28:34,879
new growth so the new growth is a big

799
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,558
sink

800
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:38,480
everything moves there the sugar moves

801
00:28:36,558 --> 00:28:40,558
there the photosynthetic the nutrients

802
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:42,798
all move to the new growth it leaves the

803
00:28:40,558 --> 00:28:44,398
older leaves without any nutrient

804
00:28:42,798 --> 00:28:46,158
because the nitrogen

805
00:28:44,398 --> 00:28:48,639
shot off to the sink and the potassium

806
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:52,399
left and went to the growing point

807
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:52,399
the older leaves show these symptoms

808
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:56,079
this is you're actually in the field

809
00:28:54,079 --> 00:28:58,558
looking at potassium deficiency and you

810
00:28:56,079 --> 00:29:01,038
can see the marginal burning very

811
00:28:58,558 --> 00:29:02,720
typical of any plant with potassium

812
00:29:01,038 --> 00:29:05,519
deficiency you see the marginal burning

813
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:07,360
because potassium is so important for

814
00:29:05,519 --> 00:29:10,359
water uptake and movement through the

815
00:29:07,359 --> 00:29:10,359
plant

816
00:29:13,359 --> 00:29:17,199
phosphorus deficiency this is what it

817
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:19,360
would look like i can't say i've ever

818
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:20,558
really seen phosphorus deficiency in the

819
00:29:19,359 --> 00:29:21,918
field

820
00:29:20,558 --> 00:29:22,960
our soils

821
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:25,360
in new york tend to have lots of

822
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:27,360
phosphorus at least historically growers

823
00:29:25,359 --> 00:29:28,879
have used manure and that has lots of

824
00:29:27,359 --> 00:29:31,119
phosphorus and

825
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:33,278
we just tend not to see a lot of it and

826
00:29:31,119 --> 00:29:35,678
again you can test for it

827
00:29:33,278 --> 00:29:37,759
and see if it's getting low

828
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:39,200
pre-plant phosphorus applications

829
00:29:37,759 --> 00:29:40,480
usually take care of everything you

830
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:42,798
might need for the rest of the life of

831
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:44,798
your planting so it's not something that

832
00:29:42,798 --> 00:29:46,480
we ever would generally ever recommend

833
00:29:44,798 --> 00:29:48,398
growers do is go out and apply

834
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:49,278
phosphorus fertilizer to an established

835
00:29:48,398 --> 00:29:51,119
field

836
00:29:49,278 --> 00:29:52,398
and even if we did phosphorus is not

837
00:29:51,119 --> 00:29:53,839
very mobile

838
00:29:52,398 --> 00:29:55,278
so it would take a couple of years

839
00:29:53,839 --> 00:29:56,879
before it ever worked its way down into

840
00:29:55,278 --> 00:29:57,679
the root zone anyway

841
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:59,440
so

842
00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:00,960
do a good job pre-plant and you don't

843
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:03,278
have to worry about phosphorus ever

844
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,278
again

845
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:11,599
phosphorus you get that reddish color is

846
00:30:09,359 --> 00:30:13,839
fairly characteristic of phosphorus

847
00:30:11,599 --> 00:30:15,439
deficiency

848
00:30:13,839 --> 00:30:18,000
now calcium deficiency that's an

849
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:19,200
interesting one calcium is also very

850
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,440
important for

851
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:22,558
movement of water in the plant

852
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:25,759
and

853
00:30:22,558 --> 00:30:26,639
calcium is transported through the

854
00:30:25,759 --> 00:30:28,000
water

855
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:29,759
it's dissolved in the water and it's

856
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,599
moved through the transpiration stream

857
00:30:29,759 --> 00:30:32,640
it's not really actively moved from cell

858
00:30:31,599 --> 00:30:34,319
to cell like a lot of the other

859
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:35,200
nutrients are it moves up through the

860
00:30:34,319 --> 00:30:37,038
water

861
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:39,759
and through the plant and if you have

862
00:30:37,038 --> 00:30:42,079
conditions that do not favor movement of

863
00:30:39,759 --> 00:30:44,480
water in the plant you sometimes will

864
00:30:42,079 --> 00:30:46,720
get calcium deficiency symptoms usually

865
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:49,200
at the extremities because the water

866
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:52,319
isn't getting out there so on this plant

867
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:55,038
here you see this browning at the tip

868
00:30:52,319 --> 00:30:57,678
and the leaf isn't unfolding properly

869
00:30:55,038 --> 00:30:58,720
brown tip here brown tip here brown tip

870
00:30:57,679 --> 00:31:01,038
here

871
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:02,640
this is the extremity of the plant the

872
00:31:01,038 --> 00:31:04,000
water is not moving through the plant

873
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:06,080
and you get that brown tip it's

874
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,839
analogous to blossom and drought of

875
00:31:06,079 --> 00:31:10,000
tomato exactly the same thing is

876
00:31:07,839 --> 00:31:12,000
happening except here's the strawberry

877
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:14,240
so to prevent calcium deficiency it's

878
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:16,000
usually not well i need to apply lime or

879
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:18,399
more calcium to the soil that's usually

880
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,000
not the solution the solution is usually

881
00:31:18,398 --> 00:31:22,000
and make sure the water the plant is

882
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,919
well irrigated

883
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:26,000
if you have situations where you let it

884
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:27,759
get really dry and then you water lots

885
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:31,960
and to get really dry again you're

886
00:31:27,759 --> 00:31:31,960
likely to see these symptoms develop

887
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:41,840
so here is another extremity

888
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:43,439
this is

889
00:31:41,839 --> 00:31:45,199
a growing tip

890
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:47,840
and it's already starting to turn brown

891
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:50,720
from the lack of calcium

892
00:31:47,839 --> 00:31:52,720
and again a runner tip you see the brown

893
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:54,159
at the end of the runner and you see the

894
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:57,759
brown leaf here

895
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:57,760
so you see it in the extremities

896
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:02,720
so um laura asked a question about how

897
00:32:01,038 --> 00:32:04,319
much reduction in yield

898
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:05,839
uh the fill would be seen i'm not

899
00:32:04,319 --> 00:32:08,000
exactly sure what field so maybe you

900
00:32:05,839 --> 00:32:09,599
could indicate what nutrient we were

901
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,599
talking about and i can give you some

902
00:32:09,599 --> 00:32:14,558
sense of that marvin i it was the

903
00:32:11,599 --> 00:32:16,240
nitrogen one i was just wondering

904
00:32:14,558 --> 00:32:17,918
if you see something like that that's

905
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:19,599
that profound

906
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:23,360
what could you tell the grower like how

907
00:32:19,599 --> 00:32:25,918
much yield might he be losing

908
00:32:23,359 --> 00:32:27,519
yeah if and it feels like you saw there

909
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:29,120
without it being fertilized for a couple

910
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:30,079
of years i wouldn't be surprised if you

911
00:32:29,119 --> 00:32:31,918
could lose

912
00:32:30,079 --> 00:32:33,519
close to you could be down about 50

913
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:37,440
percent over what you might normally

914
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:37,440
have with adequate fertilization

915
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:42,159
nitrogen is a really important nutrient

916
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:44,080
for you know lots of things but you know

917
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:46,000
plant growth and fruit development

918
00:32:44,079 --> 00:32:48,000
without that you don't get the flower

919
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,960
bud initiation that you need

920
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,079
and that's

921
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:53,200
determines the number of fruits you're

922
00:32:50,079 --> 00:32:53,199
going to have the following year

923
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,679
okay magnesium deficiency we saw this in

924
00:32:56,398 --> 00:33:00,000
blueberries remember this is the one

925
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:02,320
with a christmas tree like shape

926
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:05,200
in the leaf and here

927
00:33:02,319 --> 00:33:07,278
we still we also see

928
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:08,720
intervenal

929
00:33:07,278 --> 00:33:10,319
coloring

930
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:11,839
but in this case here unlike the

931
00:33:10,319 --> 00:33:14,879
blueberry doesn't turn red it just sort

932
00:33:11,839 --> 00:33:17,119
of turns a dark funky color

933
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:20,399
and then if it's real severe

934
00:33:17,119 --> 00:33:21,918
you'll get brown between the veins

935
00:33:20,398 --> 00:33:24,719
so again

936
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:27,278
that intervenal necrosis or coloring is

937
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:29,120
often typical of magnesium deficiency

938
00:33:27,278 --> 00:33:30,480
usually you find that when the soil ph

939
00:33:29,119 --> 00:33:32,879
is getting too low

940
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:35,360
and in the case of magnesium it's not as

941
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:37,200
mobile in the plant so you tend to see

942
00:33:35,359 --> 00:33:39,119
this on the newer leaves first as

943
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:40,399
opposed to the older leaves

944
00:33:39,119 --> 00:33:42,319
so that's one way you can look at a

945
00:33:40,398 --> 00:33:43,918
plant kind of help narrow down what the

946
00:33:42,319 --> 00:33:45,759
deficiency might be

947
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:48,559
mobile nutrients you see the deficiency

948
00:33:45,759 --> 00:33:51,119
first and overleaves immobile nutrients

949
00:33:48,558 --> 00:33:53,599
you see it first in younger leaves so

950
00:33:51,119 --> 00:33:55,839
magnesium is not as mobile it's part of

951
00:33:53,599 --> 00:33:58,079
the chlorophyll molecule and it doesn't

952
00:33:55,839 --> 00:34:00,959
move around as much it's a big molecule

953
00:33:58,079 --> 00:34:01,918
kind of stays in place so you see that

954
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:04,319
in the

955
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:06,559
younger leaves first

956
00:34:04,319 --> 00:34:08,639
marvin i just i'm sorry to interrupt i

957
00:34:06,558 --> 00:34:11,119
just want to bring to your attention i

958
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:13,679
think your voice might be dropping a

959
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:15,760
little bit in volume and

960
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:18,000
um maybe just getting a little closer to

961
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:21,000
the mic might help okay i'll try to do

962
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,000
better

963
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:27,359
so this is iron deficiency iron is also

964
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:29,039
a component of chlorophyll synthesis

965
00:34:27,358 --> 00:34:29,838
chlorophyll is a big molecule doesn't

966
00:34:29,039 --> 00:34:31,918
move

967
00:34:29,838 --> 00:34:34,239
so you see the deficiencies

968
00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:35,598
in the younger leaves first so you

969
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:37,918
notice in this plant here the older

970
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:39,519
leaves still look reasonably green but

971
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:40,719
the center leaves the younger leaves

972
00:34:39,519 --> 00:34:43,199
that are coming out are the ones that

973
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:43,199
are yellow

974
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:50,879
this is a strawberry root and it's a

975
00:34:47,918 --> 00:34:52,719
healthy root and you can see lots of

976
00:34:50,878 --> 00:34:55,279
nice white roots lots of root hairs it's

977
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:56,799
growing really well now the next slide

978
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:58,400
i'm going to show you is boron

979
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:00,960
deficiency

980
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:03,838
boron is a nutrient that's responsible

981
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:04,639
for auxin synthesis and if you remember

982
00:35:03,838 --> 00:35:06,719
from

983
00:35:04,639 --> 00:35:08,960
your biology class

984
00:35:06,719 --> 00:35:10,399
auxin was responsible for cell

985
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:12,800
elongation

986
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:14,480
so when you don't have cell elongation

987
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:16,480
you have you know the meristems abort

988
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:18,719
and you end up with stubby roots so the

989
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:21,519
next slide is a picture of a strawberry

990
00:35:18,719 --> 00:35:23,118
grown in a low boron solution and the

991
00:35:21,519 --> 00:35:25,759
root hair is just sort of abort and

992
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:27,760
you're left with these stubby roots

993
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:30,320
and with stubby roots you don't get a

994
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:32,320
very good uptake of other nutrients so

995
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:34,640
i've seen time and time again

996
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:37,599
strawberry fields and raspberry fields

997
00:35:34,639 --> 00:35:39,519
too where the leaf analysis comes back

998
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:41,440
lots of things are low

999
00:35:39,519 --> 00:35:42,159
but boron is also low

1000
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:44,800
and

1001
00:35:42,159 --> 00:35:46,960
often times not always but oftentimes if

1002
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:48,800
you correct that boron problem with a

1003
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:51,119
couple of pounds of actual boron per

1004
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:53,359
acre and get those roots to grow again

1005
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:55,119
the other deficiencies kind of correct

1006
00:35:53,358 --> 00:35:56,480
themselves because now the plant can

1007
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:58,000
take up those nutrients that it couldn't

1008
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:59,519
otherwise because there's a decent root

1009
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,320
system under it

1010
00:35:59,519 --> 00:36:03,440
so i look for boron

1011
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:04,800
frequently when i'm looking at leaf

1012
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:07,119
analysis one of the first things i look

1013
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:09,200
at and indeed if you look at all the

1014
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:10,800
leaves that were ever sent to cornell

1015
00:36:09,199 --> 00:36:13,118
in the leaf analysis

1016
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:15,599
boron is the one that's most commonly

1017
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:18,320
deficient in our leaf analyses that we

1018
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:18,320
analyze here

1019
00:36:18,639 --> 00:36:24,639
some leaf symptoms of boron deficiency

1020
00:36:22,559 --> 00:36:26,400
asymmetrical leaves

1021
00:36:24,639 --> 00:36:27,759
and then this is one kind of interesting

1022
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:29,760
too this is

1023
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:32,000
you know the fruit obviously looks like

1024
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:35,040
maybe tarnish plant bug or maybe poor

1025
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:37,599
pollination or frost injury

1026
00:36:35,039 --> 00:36:39,358
but it's boron deficiency and again

1027
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:42,480
these little

1028
00:36:39,358 --> 00:36:45,119
seeds on the strawberry are called akins

1029
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:46,800
they secrete auxin that causes the

1030
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:48,160
receptacle tissue underneath it to

1031
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:49,839
expand

1032
00:36:48,159 --> 00:36:52,319
so as long as those little akins are all

1033
00:36:49,838 --> 00:36:54,960
in gear all pollinated and all secreting

1034
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:58,160
oxen you get a really nice berry

1035
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:59,838
but if the plant can't make oxen

1036
00:36:58,159 --> 00:37:01,118
then these berries can't expand very

1037
00:36:59,838 --> 00:37:04,480
well so you get all these deformed

1038
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:07,880
berries again characteristic of severe

1039
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:07,880
boron deficiency

1040
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:12,320
now the challenge with boron is that you

1041
00:37:10,159 --> 00:37:14,239
can also apply too much it's one of

1042
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:16,240
those that doesn't have a very wide

1043
00:37:14,239 --> 00:37:17,838
range of where it's either you know

1044
00:37:16,239 --> 00:37:19,598
deficient or toxic so you've got to make

1045
00:37:17,838 --> 00:37:21,519
sure you don't put on too much or you'll

1046
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:23,280
get the burning

1047
00:37:21,519 --> 00:37:24,719
the burning in this case

1048
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:26,400
it looks very much like potassium

1049
00:37:24,719 --> 00:37:29,118
deficiency but it's actually boron

1050
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:29,119
toxicity

1051
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:34,480
and this is also you know zinc too much

1052
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:37,119
zinc can cause

1053
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:38,800
you know problems as well as too little

1054
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:41,200
and that's why the leaf analysis is so

1055
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:41,200
important

1056
00:37:43,039 --> 00:37:46,159
just a couple of things on raspberries

1057
00:37:44,639 --> 00:37:47,759
and blackberries we're not going to go

1058
00:37:46,159 --> 00:37:49,598
through the whole feel like we did with

1059
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:51,359
blueberries and strawberries but we have

1060
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:53,119
the summer bearing types

1061
00:37:51,358 --> 00:37:54,799
and just some thoughts on nitrogen there

1062
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:56,240
too much nitrogen can lead to winter

1063
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:57,519
injury

1064
00:37:56,239 --> 00:37:59,358
on summer bearing types because they

1065
00:37:57,519 --> 00:38:02,159
have to get through the winter and so

1066
00:37:59,358 --> 00:38:04,239
can fertilizing too late therefore with

1067
00:38:02,159 --> 00:38:06,879
summer bearing raspberries we fertilize

1068
00:38:04,239 --> 00:38:09,118
in the spring

1069
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:10,960
if you fertilize too late or use too

1070
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:12,640
much you'll get winter injury and we can

1071
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:13,838
see winter injury right here it's killed

1072
00:38:12,639 --> 00:38:16,319
the canes

1073
00:38:13,838 --> 00:38:20,480
the new primocanes are growing just fine

1074
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:20,480
but the old canes aren't doing so well

1075
00:38:20,559 --> 00:38:24,960
now fall bearing raspberry since we

1076
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:27,039
usually mow those down every year

1077
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:29,440
it's you know too much nitrogen usually

1078
00:38:27,039 --> 00:38:31,279
isn't an issue and raspberries have a

1079
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:32,880
pretty extensive root system and they're

1080
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:34,960
really good efficient at taking up

1081
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:36,640
nitrogen so

1082
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:37,920
they can handle a lot more nitrogen and

1083
00:38:36,639 --> 00:38:40,078
they grow

1084
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:42,320
more vigorously with more nitrogen and

1085
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:43,839
they can handle it so there we fertilize

1086
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:45,039
in the spring and we can fertilize in

1087
00:38:43,838 --> 00:38:47,440
the summer

1088
00:38:45,039 --> 00:38:48,880
at and combine the rates a little bit

1089
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:50,800
higher because you don't have to worry

1090
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:52,240
about going too late

1091
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:55,599
or putting on too much because we're

1092
00:38:52,239 --> 00:38:57,039
just going to cut the canes anyway

1093
00:38:55,599 --> 00:39:00,400
we've done a little bit of work on

1094
00:38:57,039 --> 00:39:03,519
foliar feeding of raspberries

1095
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:05,599
and we put on these foliar sprays and we

1096
00:39:03,519 --> 00:39:07,280
monitored the uptake of the foliar spray

1097
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:10,079
into the plant we used

1098
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:11,760
n15 which is sort of a tracer it's not

1099
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:13,359
radioactive it's a stable isotope of

1100
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:16,400
nitrogen but you can spray it on and

1101
00:39:13,358 --> 00:39:19,519
watch it move into the plant

1102
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:22,240
and we looked at various factors to see

1103
00:39:19,519 --> 00:39:24,480
if any factors might aid in the uptake

1104
00:39:22,239 --> 00:39:25,759
of the urea that was labeled

1105
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:27,679
and we looked at

1106
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:30,480
surfactants

1107
00:39:27,679 --> 00:39:32,480
we looked at you know time of day

1108
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:34,000
we looked at the ph as a solution we

1109
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:35,838
looked at plants that were stressed or

1110
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,599
not because a lot of the companies that

1111
00:39:35,838 --> 00:39:38,960
sell these products say well you know

1112
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:40,320
you didn't put them on at the right time

1113
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:42,559
or didn't have the right surfactant and

1114
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:44,400
stuff like that this is our control

1115
00:39:42,559 --> 00:39:45,920
we were getting his you know our

1116
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:47,280
standard treatment just mixing it with

1117
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:49,519
water and spraying on was giving us

1118
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:51,599
almost 50 percent of the nitrogen being

1119
00:39:49,519 --> 00:39:53,679
absorbed almost anything else we do

1120
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:54,880
either didn't make a difference or

1121
00:39:53,679 --> 00:39:56,799
actually

1122
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:57,760
reduce the uptake

1123
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:59,200
so

1124
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:01,119
i don't think there's anything magic if

1125
00:39:59,199 --> 00:40:02,719
you want to use it about half of it goes

1126
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:04,480
on

1127
00:40:02,719 --> 00:40:06,239
we did the same thing

1128
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:08,480
looking at a potassium analog in this

1129
00:40:06,239 --> 00:40:10,799
case we looked at rubidium which is a

1130
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:12,880
periodic chart it's the same valence as

1131
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:14,880
potassium behaves the same way

1132
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:16,880
sprayed to rubidium on looked at uptake

1133
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:18,480
again almost the same thing our standard

1134
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:19,760
treatment was pretty much as good as we

1135
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:21,358
could get

1136
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:22,880
maybe putting on early in the morning

1137
00:40:21,358 --> 00:40:24,639
was a little bit better but for the most

1138
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:26,000
part it didn't make a difference

1139
00:40:24,639 --> 00:40:28,000
the problem with these foliar

1140
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:30,960
applications though is that even though

1141
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:34,400
we get 50 uptake you can only put on

1142
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:36,800
about five pounds of actual urea per

1143
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:39,039
acre at any one time or else you get

1144
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:41,200
toxicity to the leaf if the plant's only

1145
00:40:39,039 --> 00:40:43,279
taking up 50 of that

1146
00:40:41,199 --> 00:40:45,118
that's two and a half pounds and truth

1147
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:47,200
of the matter is not all that you spray

1148
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:48,720
on hits the plant some of it just goes

1149
00:40:47,199 --> 00:40:50,000
off into the air it never really touches

1150
00:40:48,719 --> 00:40:51,598
a plant so

1151
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,920
in actuality you're probably only really

1152
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:56,000
getting into the plant one or one and a

1153
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:57,760
half pounds of actual nitrogen with

1154
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,838
every time you spray

1155
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:01,680
so it's not a very efficient way of

1156
00:40:59,838 --> 00:41:04,000
applying nitrogen you almost have to

1157
00:41:01,679 --> 00:41:05,440
spray every day to get give the plant

1158
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,760
the nitrogen it needs from foliar

1159
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:09,519
applications and our data show that it

1160
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:11,440
doesn't make any difference anyway when

1161
00:41:09,519 --> 00:41:12,400
it's sprayed during the growing season

1162
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:14,400
the only time we're seeing the

1163
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:15,440
difference is when it's sprayed late in

1164
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:18,720
the fall

1165
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:20,800
to contribute to those nitrogen reserves

1166
00:41:18,719 --> 00:41:23,199
so to wrap everything up

1167
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:25,039
pre-plan amendments are important

1168
00:41:23,199 --> 00:41:27,759
bases on soil test recommendations from

1169
00:41:25,039 --> 00:41:29,358
a reputable lab

1170
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:31,440
use leaf analysis to fine-tune your

1171
00:41:29,358 --> 00:41:33,519
fertilization and establish plantings

1172
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:35,440
and generally not always but generally

1173
00:41:33,519 --> 00:41:36,559
restrict nitrogen applications to the

1174
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:38,079
spring

1175
00:41:36,559 --> 00:41:39,599
although evidence exists of building

1176
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:41,920
reserve nitrogen late fall can be

1177
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:44,920
helpful if carbohydrate status is

1178
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:44,920
adequate

1179
00:41:48,159 --> 00:41:50,879
so

1180
00:41:49,679 --> 00:41:53,039
all right

1181
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:56,000
thank you thank you marvin does anybody

1182
00:41:53,039 --> 00:41:58,559
have any questions and i apologize if

1183
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:01,199
there's some problem with the audio for

1184
00:41:58,559 --> 00:42:04,000
some people um it sounded really good to

1185
00:42:01,199 --> 00:42:05,759
me but that doesn't mean that everyone

1186
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,838
else is having good reception and i

1187
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:09,200
certainly would appreciate feedback

1188
00:42:07,838 --> 00:42:11,119
about how the quality of the

1189
00:42:09,199 --> 00:42:12,159
presentation

1190
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:14,000
and

1191
00:42:12,159 --> 00:42:16,960
so this is your opportunity to ask

1192
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:19,039
marvin some questions about the

1193
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:21,519
the presentation does anybody have any

1194
00:42:19,039 --> 00:42:21,519
questions

1195
00:42:23,199 --> 00:42:28,960
if not i'm going to move into the final

1196
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:31,679
oh hold on

1197
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:33,760
stephanie has a question stephanie

1198
00:42:31,679 --> 00:42:35,440
would you i think you have a microphone

1199
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:39,640
now if you have one or you could type

1200
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:39,639
the question in the chat box

1201
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:49,440
okay i'm not hearing from stephanie you

1202
00:42:47,838 --> 00:42:50,960
might want to

1203
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:53,200
type right down at the bottom of the

1204
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:56,000
chat box stephanie or if you have a

1205
00:42:53,199 --> 00:42:59,838
microphone i you are unable to to ask

1206
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,838
the question right now

1207
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:11,280
so molly just asked a question about

1208
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:13,838
were the last comments

1209
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:16,160
about foliar feeding for strawberries or

1210
00:43:13,838 --> 00:43:18,960
raspberries the data i showed you an

1211
00:43:16,159 --> 00:43:21,759
uptake was for raspberries

1212
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:23,920
the data i showed you on the actual

1213
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:27,280
yield response for fall foliar

1214
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:29,280
fertilization was for strawberries but

1215
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:31,280
strawberries and raspberries

1216
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:33,359
are fairly close related and most of the

1217
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:35,280
time when people do these studies they

1218
00:43:33,358 --> 00:43:37,199
find that strawberries and raspberries

1219
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:39,280
generally spawn the same way

1220
00:43:37,199 --> 00:43:41,279
so i wouldn't be surprised

1221
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:43,200
if we did those same studies that we did

1222
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:45,440
on strawberries with fall foliar

1223
00:43:43,199 --> 00:43:47,519
applications we did that to

1224
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:49,838
raspberries whether we would see the

1225
00:43:47,519 --> 00:43:51,599
same response ylang chung here in the

1226
00:43:49,838 --> 00:43:54,400
department has done those

1227
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:56,880
studies on grapes and apples and he's

1228
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:57,680
found the exact same thing that late

1229
00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:00,400
fall

1230
00:43:57,679 --> 00:44:02,719
foliary applications increase nitrogen

1231
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:04,000
reserves and improve yields the

1232
00:44:02,719 --> 00:44:06,799
following year provided that

1233
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:08,559
carbohydrate levels are not too low

1234
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:10,240
i don't see why raspberries would be any

1235
00:44:08,559 --> 00:44:12,480
different

1236
00:44:10,239 --> 00:44:14,559
um marvin there was a question from dan

1237
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:18,000
welch about differences in nutrients for

1238
00:44:14,559 --> 00:44:20,799
day neutral strawberries

1239
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:22,559
okay yeah so day neutral strawberries

1240
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:24,480
are quite different than the regular

1241
00:44:22,559 --> 00:44:26,719
perennial strawberries they have very

1242
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:28,800
shallow root systems

1243
00:44:26,719 --> 00:44:31,279
they allocate only about

1244
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:32,880
10 of their growth to roots and that's

1245
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:35,119
pretty low compared to like a raspberry

1246
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:36,960
where it's 50 or more so these really

1247
00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:39,119
shallow roots they don't go out very far

1248
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:40,720
so with they neutral strawberries you

1249
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:43,760
really do have to

1250
00:44:40,719 --> 00:44:45,199
spoon feed those nitrogen almost all

1251
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:47,520
season long

1252
00:44:45,199 --> 00:44:49,279
and we recommend

1253
00:44:47,519 --> 00:44:51,920
about one pound

1254
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:54,720
of actual nitrogen a day for day neutral

1255
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:56,559
strawberries during the growing season

1256
00:44:54,719 --> 00:44:58,239
now you don't have to fertilize them

1257
00:44:56,559 --> 00:44:59,679
every day unless you're set up to do

1258
00:44:58,239 --> 00:45:01,679
that you can put a pound of nitrogen

1259
00:44:59,679 --> 00:45:03,919
through the irrigation system

1260
00:45:01,679 --> 00:45:06,078
once a day but we don't recommend going

1261
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:07,200
more than about seven days before you do

1262
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:08,560
apply

1263
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:09,598
that nitrogen so if you're gonna do it

1264
00:45:08,559 --> 00:45:12,078
weekly

1265
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:13,838
you know seven pounds every week would

1266
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:15,839
be equivalent one pound a day but they

1267
00:45:13,838 --> 00:45:17,358
need that much to get them through and

1268
00:45:15,838 --> 00:45:20,480
if you add that up over the entire

1269
00:45:17,358 --> 00:45:22,078
season they're using more nitrogen than

1270
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:23,760
a regular strawberry it probably

1271
00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:24,800
shouldn't say they're using more but

1272
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:26,160
they just

1273
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:28,000
need a lot of nitrogen around because

1274
00:45:26,159 --> 00:45:30,399
their roots aren't really very good at

1275
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:31,679
sequestering what's there so you spoon

1276
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:34,000
feed them

1277
00:45:31,679 --> 00:45:36,559
and uh about one pound a day the other

1278
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:38,000
nutrients potassium

1279
00:45:36,559 --> 00:45:39,440
phosphorus and all

1280
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:41,519
that's the same you know if you put

1281
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:43,039
enough in the ground before you plant

1282
00:45:41,519 --> 00:45:44,318
then you don't have to worry about that

1283
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:46,400
and they're they're grown mostly as

1284
00:45:44,318 --> 00:45:48,960
annuals anyway so that's not a big deal

1285
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:50,639
with daniel's but the nitrogen is

1286
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:51,679
and we don't have to worry for most part

1287
00:45:50,639 --> 00:45:53,440
about

1288
00:45:51,679 --> 00:45:54,960
fall folder applications because most

1289
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:57,679
people are not overwintering their day

1290
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:59,358
neutrals anyway but if they would it

1291
00:45:57,679 --> 00:46:01,679
would probably have the same response as

1292
00:45:59,358 --> 00:46:03,920
a june bearing

1293
00:46:01,679 --> 00:46:05,759
craig thank you very much for answering

1294
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:08,000
that one question

1295
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:09,920
these series have all been recorded and

1296
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:11,440
this one will also be available it was

1297
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:13,920
recorded today

1298
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:15,519
and we will open them up to the general

1299
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:17,838
public shortly

1300
00:46:15,519 --> 00:46:19,599
so you can

1301
00:46:17,838 --> 00:46:21,440
you know you will be able to get them or

1302
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:23,039
and recommend them to growers if you

1303
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:24,480
would like to do that

1304
00:46:23,039 --> 00:46:27,679
i want to thank

1305
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:30,480
dr pritz for taking the time today and

1306
00:46:27,679 --> 00:46:32,639
earlier in the session and also greg

1307
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:34,719
loeb and courtney weber because they

1308
00:46:32,639 --> 00:46:36,799
were the other speakers it was a little

1309
00:46:34,719 --> 00:46:38,559
bit different presentation style and i

1310
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:39,359
really appreciate them

1311
00:46:38,559 --> 00:46:41,279
uh

1312
00:46:39,358 --> 00:46:44,000
you know taking the time to learn how to

1313
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:46,480
do it and everything i also want to

1314
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:48,559
thank all of you for joining us it

1315
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:50,240
really wouldn't be any good if we didn't

1316
00:46:48,559 --> 00:46:51,519
have anybody listening and asking

1317
00:46:50,239 --> 00:46:54,559
questions

1318
00:46:51,519 --> 00:46:57,280
and i do want to ask if you folks

1319
00:46:54,559 --> 00:46:58,318
wouldn't mind just taking one quick exit

1320
00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:01,680
poll

1321
00:46:58,318 --> 00:47:05,639
and i'll deliver this now

1322
00:47:01,679 --> 00:47:05,639
just give us a little feedback

1323
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:16,318
this is an um multiple answer so you'll

1324
00:47:15,358 --> 00:47:18,719
just

1325
00:47:16,318 --> 00:47:21,039
read the questions as they're numbered

1326
00:47:18,719 --> 00:47:22,959
and then answer them in the boxes just

1327
00:47:21,039 --> 00:47:24,880
click on the box you don't have to hit a

1328
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:28,000
submit or anything

1329
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:30,880
and we will be able to have that data

1330
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:32,480
to help us evaluate the sessions and

1331
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:35,039
then also

1332
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:37,199
maybe move forward with some other

1333
00:47:35,039 --> 00:47:38,639
webcast training

1334
00:47:37,199 --> 00:47:41,679
and then unless you have any other

1335
00:47:38,639 --> 00:47:43,920
questions for marvin after this poll is

1336
00:47:41,679 --> 00:47:43,919
done

1337
00:47:44,318 --> 00:47:49,000
that's it thank you very much

1338
00:48:01,039 --> 00:48:06,000
pretty much everybody that i expected

1339
00:48:04,318 --> 00:48:08,318
to weigh in has weighed in and i

1340
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:11,358
appreciate that

1341
00:48:08,318 --> 00:48:16,199
and if anything else to add please go
