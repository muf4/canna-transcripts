1
00:00:00,919 --> 00:00:05,000
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,718 --> 00:00:08,119
University and uh thank you for the

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,120
invitation to uh to be here today um and

4
00:00:08,119 --> 00:00:12,000
for letting me choose my own topic to

5
00:00:10,119 --> 00:00:14,878
speak about because those of you who

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,920
know me probably know that for much of

7
00:00:14,878 --> 00:00:19,559
the past decade I've really work mainly

8
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:21,760
on irrigation control my students like

9
00:00:19,559 --> 00:00:23,879
to say that I'm a control freak I've

10
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,760
been controlling irrigation I don't want

11
00:00:23,879 --> 00:00:27,799
to stop there I now want to control

12
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,759
light and I want to control light in a

13
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:33,399
smarter way than what we have done in

14
00:00:29,759 --> 00:00:37,399
the last uh much of my work was inspired

15
00:00:33,399 --> 00:00:39,920
by a book that was published in 2011 I

16
00:00:37,399 --> 00:00:43,280
think it's an interesting book it is

17
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:45,200
full of uh vague claims uh poor

18
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,480
understanding of PL science but it

19
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:49,960
inspired a lot of people and quite

20
00:00:47,479 --> 00:00:53,279
frankly the book was written by Dixon

21
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:54,878
desier we may not agree with the claims

22
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,800
that he makes but I think we should

23
00:00:54,878 --> 00:00:59,280
thank him for putting controlled

24
00:00:56,799 --> 00:01:01,159
environment agriculture on the Forefront

25
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:04,040
of night of of a national discussion

26
00:01:01,159 --> 00:01:07,438
about how we are going to grow food in

27
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:10,320
the future and so I think because he is

28
00:01:07,438 --> 00:01:11,798
incredible at PR there are lots of uh

29
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:14,279
people who are really interested in

30
00:01:11,799 --> 00:01:16,720
vertical farms in producing food in

31
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:19,478
places where we may or may not be able

32
00:01:16,719 --> 00:01:21,039
to grow food efficiently but it has

33
00:01:19,478 --> 00:01:23,200
generated a lot of research

34
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:26,280
opportunities if nothing else I think

35
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:28,280
the people were probably most fascinated

36
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:30,000
with vertical Farms were Architects

37
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:32,040
because as soon as this book came out

38
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,118
architect started architect started

39
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:35,840
making beautiful designs for what

40
00:01:34,118 --> 00:01:38,680
vertical Farms should look like and it

41
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:41,000
is actually a lot of fun to just Google

42
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:43,560
images for vertical Farms because they

43
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,920
are absolutely beautiful um they

44
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:48,200
probably don't work but I would love to

45
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:51,280
see this building right here wouldn't

46
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:53,280
that be cool to be able to visit that um

47
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:57,680
let's hope someone is going to invest in

48
00:01:53,280 --> 00:02:00,320
that thing and make it happen um German

49
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:02,399
engine Engineers not architect they took

50
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:03,919
a slightly more pragmatic approach to

51
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:06,519
what it would take to actually run a

52
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:08,640
vertical farm so they came up with this

53
00:02:06,519 --> 00:02:11,079
design it is not nearly as pretty but

54
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:13,079
they did all of the engineering to try

55
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:16,120
to figure out what it would actually

56
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:18,760
take to build a large vertical farm and

57
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:21,400
produce food year round in a facility

58
00:02:18,759 --> 00:02:26,439
like that so this vertical Farm has a

59
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:32,080
footprint of 44 by 44 uh met it is 37

60
00:02:26,439 --> 00:02:33,959
floors tall and um they um probably over

61
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,840
engineered the building since these are

62
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:38,080
aerospace engineers and they do like to

63
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:40,560
over engineer things but I looked then

64
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:42,159
at how much does it cost to build this

65
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,878
and this building would be a little bit

66
00:02:42,158 --> 00:02:46,959
over $300 million so we need a

67
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:48,799
substantial investor to be able to make

68
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:51,360
that happen but what I was more

69
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:53,439
interested in is uh the analysis that

70
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,760
they did on what it takes to actually

71
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:58,639
run that facility on a year-to-year

72
00:02:55,759 --> 00:03:00,560
basis so it turns out that the power

73
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:04,318
consumption for this veral farm would be

74
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:09,000
400,000 kilowatt kilowatt hours per day

75
00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:12,798
and it would cost about 32 to 35 million

76
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:16,158
these values here are in Euros a year to

77
00:03:12,799 --> 00:03:17,920
pay for the power for this electricity

78
00:03:16,158 --> 00:03:21,000
now this number probably doesn't mean a

79
00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:24,119
whole lot to you but 400,000 kilowatt

80
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,120
hours a day is pretty much when you

81
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:28,158
compare that to a household a typical

82
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:30,319
household is about 30 kilowatt hours per

83
00:03:28,158 --> 00:03:32,280
day and it turns out that this number

84
00:03:30,318 --> 00:03:36,679
right here is probably pretty close to

85
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:39,280
the power consumption of Etha a c size

86
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:42,040
so that's what it takes to run this one

87
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:45,080
vertical farm so there is a tremendous

88
00:03:42,039 --> 00:03:47,000
amount of power that you need to do this

89
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:51,080
and much of the cost of running these

90
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:53,639
things 60% is in power consumption their

91
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:56,319
calculations show that half of this 30%

92
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:59,759
of total operating cost was to run the

93
00:03:56,318 --> 00:04:02,280
LEDs much of the rest U of the power use

94
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:04,039
would be for uh air conditioning and

95
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:06,560
part of that air conditioning is is

96
00:04:04,039 --> 00:04:10,158
needed to remove the heat that you

97
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:12,079
actually get from the LEDs so in reality

98
00:04:10,158 --> 00:04:14,840
um the cost of running lights is

99
00:04:12,079 --> 00:04:17,160
probably about 40 to 50% of the total

100
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:18,478
cost to run a facility like this and

101
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:21,959
it's a lot of

102
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:24,079
money um my research isn't just limited

103
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:26,879
to Vertical Farms this is an example of

104
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:29,918
a small vertical farm that is actually

105
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:32,079
just outside of um uh Atlanta that are

106
00:04:29,918 --> 00:04:33,599
close to the airport they located next

107
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:36,639
to the airport because they get

108
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:38,199
naturally 800 PS per million CO2 there

109
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:40,079
apparently just from the airplanes

110
00:04:38,199 --> 00:04:44,000
taking off it's pretty amazing how much

111
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:45,879
CO2 that generates so they uh typically

112
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,120
use very little CO2 enrichment they

113
00:04:45,879 --> 00:04:49,600
don't have to but so you can see here

114
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:52,680
that they're working with fluorescent

115
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:55,039
lights they grow these plants under

116
00:04:52,680 --> 00:05:01,120
amazingly low light levels but still for

117
00:04:55,038 --> 00:05:04,000
them um the light is a big cost for them

118
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:06,478
um in green houses worst case scenario

119
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,800
you you may be spending up to about $500

120
00:05:06,478 --> 00:05:12,240
a day on the power to run supplemental

121
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:13,918
Lighting in the greenhouse so this too

122
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:17,079
when you add that up over the course of

123
00:05:13,918 --> 00:05:19,399
a year um that can be a substantial

124
00:05:17,079 --> 00:05:21,519
amount of money just last week I was in

125
00:05:19,399 --> 00:05:23,439
a 100 acre

126
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:25,399
greenhouse um where they use

127
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:27,038
supplemental lighting I don't know what

128
00:05:25,399 --> 00:05:28,879
the power bill is but they spend

129
00:05:27,038 --> 00:05:30,279
millions of dollars a year on

130
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:35,399
electricity

131
00:05:30,279 --> 00:05:38,918
uh for the lighting um so it can be

132
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:42,079
expensive so people think that LEDs are

133
00:05:38,918 --> 00:05:45,879
the solution to everything um and the

134
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:47,318
question is are LEDs the solution to um

135
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:49,519
solve these lighting issues and

136
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:52,120
controlled environment agriculture first

137
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:55,519
of all when people tell you that LEDs

138
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:57,280
don't generate heat just laugh just

139
00:05:55,519 --> 00:06:00,000
start laughing right away you hear that

140
00:05:57,279 --> 00:06:03,279
claim a lot it's just not possible

141
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:06,160
so LEDs uh good LEDs right now I think

142
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:07,839
are 30 maybe 40% efficient that means

143
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:10,720
that's the energy that gets converted

144
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:12,519
into light all of that other energy is

145
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:15,599
going to have to go somewhere that is

146
00:06:12,519 --> 00:06:17,478
basic physics so all that other energy

147
00:06:15,598 --> 00:06:20,079
is heat that gets

148
00:06:17,478 --> 00:06:21,560
generated um the difference between LEDs

149
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:24,478
and most other lights are that we

150
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:27,199
normally use is that the LED light

151
00:06:24,478 --> 00:06:28,680
itself you can get really close to it it

152
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:31,160
doesn't generate a lot of heat it's the

153
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:32,840
electronics on the back side of the LED

154
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:35,120
where the heat is generated and that

155
00:06:32,839 --> 00:06:37,038
heat you actually have to remove if you

156
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:39,918
don't remove that an LED will burn up in

157
00:06:37,038 --> 00:06:43,478
a matter of probably milliseconds if not

158
00:06:39,918 --> 00:06:45,598
seconds um so LEDs have been around for

159
00:06:43,478 --> 00:06:48,399
a while the two green lights show

160
00:06:45,598 --> 00:06:50,959
different kinds of LEDs right here but

161
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:54,359
they have really become more prevalent

162
00:06:50,959 --> 00:06:56,159
in the last 5 to 10 years and one reason

163
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:58,840
that I have become so much more common

164
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:01,919
than they used to be sorry is that the

165
00:06:58,839 --> 00:07:04,079
efficiency of LEDs has rapidly increased

166
00:07:01,918 --> 00:07:06,439
so it is a rapidly evolving

167
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:07,959
technology and right now people may

168
00:07:06,439 --> 00:07:10,038
argue about whether they are more

169
00:07:07,959 --> 00:07:11,680
efficient or equally efficient as the

170
00:07:10,038 --> 00:07:13,800
best high pressure sodium lights that

171
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:15,478
are out on the market there may not be

172
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:19,079
much of a difference in efficiency at

173
00:07:15,478 --> 00:07:21,519
this point but led technology since it

174
00:07:19,079 --> 00:07:23,758
is still relatively new is likely to

175
00:07:21,519 --> 00:07:26,399
become substantially more efficient than

176
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:28,639
any other light source we have uh right

177
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:31,318
now so that makes it a good choice

178
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:33,000
potentially for supplemental lighting or

179
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:36,360
for sour Source lighting where you grow

180
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:38,959
plans in a completely enclosed

181
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:41,759
environment so another advantage in

182
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:44,560
addition to the efficiency is that LEDs

183
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:47,520
if you use them correctly they can last

184
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:49,240
a very long time and that using them

185
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:50,959
correctly is mainly depending on making

186
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:53,038
sure they don't get more power than they

187
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:55,359
should because that will quickly wear

188
00:07:53,038 --> 00:07:58,079
them out and make sure that they cool

189
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:00,080
that they are cooled appropriately I

190
00:07:58,079 --> 00:08:01,959
mentioned previously that the light

191
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:03,478
itself does not get hot so that means

192
00:08:01,959 --> 00:08:06,079
that you can have these light these

193
00:08:03,478 --> 00:08:08,199
lights very close to the canopy or you

194
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:10,560
can even put them inside of the canopy

195
00:08:08,199 --> 00:08:12,680
so this is a picture of Philips light

196
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:16,120
bars where they put them inside of a

197
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:18,639
tomato crop and it doesn't burn the

198
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:20,240
leaves so that's that is a big

199
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:22,199
difference compared to the more

200
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:25,639
traditional high-intensity discharge

201
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:28,280
lights that we've always used in um in

202
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:30,759
green houses another advantage of this

203
00:08:28,279 --> 00:08:33,158
is that this actually allows you to get

204
00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:35,320
light into the bottom part of the canopy

205
00:08:33,158 --> 00:08:36,958
when you use uh traditional

206
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:38,800
high-intensity discharge lights you

207
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:40,799
would have your light somewhere above

208
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:42,838
the canopy obviously off the picture

209
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:46,679
here that light is coming down but it's

210
00:08:42,839 --> 00:08:48,399
going to be absorbed almost entirely by

211
00:08:46,679 --> 00:08:50,319
the leaves in the top of the canopy so

212
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:52,759
this is a way to get a more even light

213
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:55,480
distribution and that should help

214
00:08:52,759 --> 00:08:57,480
overall canopy

215
00:08:55,480 --> 00:09:00,480
photosynthesis there is a drawback to

216
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:02,039
LEDs and they are still very expensive

217
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:04,200
they are getting cheaper they are

218
00:09:02,039 --> 00:09:06,919
continuously getting cheaper but right

219
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:09,120
now the question of whether or not it is

220
00:09:06,919 --> 00:09:11,759
actually cost effective to

221
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:14,639
replace um high-intensity discharge

222
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:16,439
lights with LEDs is a pretty tough

223
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:18,919
question to answer do you get enough

224
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:21,079
benefits from them to make it worthwhile

225
00:09:18,919 --> 00:09:24,360
to make that

226
00:09:21,078 --> 00:09:26,439
Replacements but we are still in many

227
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:29,720
cases when I look at LED research we are

228
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:32,720
using LEDs as if they are just a

229
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:36,519
replacement for traditional lights and

230
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:38,639
LEDs have much more capability than a

231
00:09:36,519 --> 00:09:40,959
high press sodium or a metal halight

232
00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:43,519
light you can get them in pretty much

233
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:47,000
any spectrum that you want but what I am

234
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:50,000
most interested in is controlling the

235
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:52,679
light levels that we get from the LED

236
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,320
lights and matching that light level to

237
00:09:52,679 --> 00:09:57,838
the physiological ability of the plants

238
00:09:55,320 --> 00:10:00,959
to actually use that light so it turns

239
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:04,160
out that controlling in LEDs is actually

240
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:06,639
very easy and very cheap it's not often

241
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:08,639
that you have that combination um the

242
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:11,120
investment is practically nothing if you

243
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:13,559
want to do this so with LEDs one thing

244
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:15,919
that we can do is we can very easily

245
00:10:13,559 --> 00:10:18,919
control the frequency at which they turn

246
00:10:15,919 --> 00:10:20,919
on and off and you probably don't

247
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:23,240
realize that but the standard demo that

248
00:10:20,919 --> 00:10:25,278
you may have in this room or that you

249
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:27,560
may have at home and light dmer actually

250
00:10:25,278 --> 00:10:30,480
does the same thing it turns off the

251
00:10:27,559 --> 00:10:32,879
current to your light bulb on and off um

252
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,759
at a high frequency we can tell that

253
00:10:32,879 --> 00:10:37,399
because it goes so fast that our our

254
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:39,799
eyes cannot detect it but so with LEDs

255
00:10:37,399 --> 00:10:41,879
we can turn these lights on and off but

256
00:10:39,799 --> 00:10:44,479
in addition to that what we can do then

257
00:10:41,879 --> 00:10:47,720
is we can control the duty cycle of the

258
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:50,399
LEDs so what that means is within one on

259
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:54,120
off cycle so this is off on and off

260
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:57,120
again how long are these LEDs actually

261
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:59,959
on so in this example here we have a 50%

262
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:03,480
duty cycle and and that basically gives

263
00:10:59,958 --> 00:11:05,439
us effectively half of the light output

264
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:07,720
that you get from when the LEDs are on

265
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:10,720
fulltime so this would be a medium light

266
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:13,920
level if we go to a 10% duty cycle the

267
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:16,040
LEDs are only on a small um amount of

268
00:11:13,919 --> 00:11:18,039
the time and you get a much lower light

269
00:11:16,039 --> 00:11:20,480
level and then likewise if you increase

270
00:11:18,039 --> 00:11:23,319
the duty cycle you get higher light

271
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:25,639
levels so adjusting that duty cycle is

272
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:27,800
really easy I didn't realize that this

273
00:11:25,639 --> 00:11:30,200
until I as an engineer if he could build

274
00:11:27,799 --> 00:11:31,639
a board for me and he said well yes I

275
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:34,120
could but I'll just have an undergrad

276
00:11:31,639 --> 00:11:35,519
put it together for you um apparently it

277
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:38,799
is that

278
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:40,000
complicated um so sometimes it is good

279
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:42,359
to talk to

280
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:47,759
Engineers is Lou

281
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:50,120
here um so what what I am focused on is

282
00:11:47,759 --> 00:11:53,240
what I want to do is to optimize the

283
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:55,519
light use efficiency so I'm going to go

284
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:58,360
through the physiology of what actually

285
00:11:55,519 --> 00:12:00,240
happens to light when you are providing

286
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:04,680
light to a cross prop and then that will

287
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:07,440
get us to how we are using that um plant

288
00:12:04,679 --> 00:12:09,759
physi plant physiological background to

289
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:11,240
actually control the lights so

290
00:12:09,759 --> 00:12:13,078
ultimately what really needs to happen

291
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:16,799
in the light reactions of photosynthesis

292
00:12:13,078 --> 00:12:19,879
is that we have to make nadph and

293
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:21,679
ATP plants don't use light very

294
00:12:19,879 --> 00:12:24,039
efficiently necessarily sometimes they

295
00:12:21,679 --> 00:12:26,479
do sometimes they they don't it largely

296
00:12:24,039 --> 00:12:28,919
depends on how much light you give them

297
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:31,079
the more light you give a plant the less

298
00:12:28,919 --> 00:12:34,159
efficiently the plant is actually using

299
00:12:31,078 --> 00:12:36,198
that light but the way this works um in

300
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:38,360
the chloroplast is that light gets

301
00:12:36,198 --> 00:12:40,559
absorbed by chlorophyll molecules and

302
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:42,600
what hopefully will happen is that

303
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:44,159
excitation energy from that photon is

304
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:45,920
transferred from one chlorophyll to

305
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:48,480
another and ultimately to the reaction

306
00:12:45,919 --> 00:12:51,519
Center of either photosystem one or

307
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:55,399
photos system 2 and there that energy

308
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:58,078
from that photon is used to move an

309
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:59,639
electron from one from a donor to an

310
00:12:58,078 --> 00:13:02,239
acceptor and then there is a whole

311
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:04,519
electron transport chain that follows

312
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:06,839
this so this process is referred to as

313
00:13:04,519 --> 00:13:09,440
photochemistry this is what we want to

314
00:13:06,839 --> 00:13:11,199
happen with the light that is absorbed

315
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:13,440
by

316
00:13:11,198 --> 00:13:15,120
leaves and when that happens so this

317
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:18,600
gives you a better idea of the overall

318
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:20,519
electron transport uh chain we have a

319
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:22,959
photon that comes in this case from the

320
00:13:20,519 --> 00:13:26,000
Sun it reaches the reaction Center of

321
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:28,039
photos system to and then electron goes

322
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,720
from water it is transported initially

323
00:13:28,039 --> 00:13:31,719
to this point and this is the rate

324
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:34,278
limiting step I'll come back to that

325
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:37,120
later this turns out to be important for

326
00:13:34,278 --> 00:13:39,278
some of the work that we do um and if it

327
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:42,120
gets past this bottleneck then that

328
00:13:39,278 --> 00:13:45,559
electron moves ultimately to nadph and

329
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:47,679
now we have reductant that gets produced

330
00:13:45,559 --> 00:13:50,518
that can be used in the Kelvin cycle to

331
00:13:47,679 --> 00:13:52,838
ultimately make carbohydrates at the

332
00:13:50,519 --> 00:13:55,639
same time what is happening in this

333
00:13:52,839 --> 00:13:58,759
process is that hydrogen actually moves

334
00:13:55,639 --> 00:14:00,399
from the stroma into the Lumen and

335
00:13:58,759 --> 00:14:02,320
hydrogen is produced from the splitting

336
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:05,360
of water right here so we got a pH

337
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:08,278
gradient across this membrane and that

338
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:12,879
that pH gradient is used right here to

339
00:14:08,278 --> 00:14:14,519
make ATP so now we have nadph and ATP

340
00:14:12,879 --> 00:14:16,799
and that is ultimately the energy that

341
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:20,519
is going to drive the Calin

342
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:22,958
cycle unfortunately not all of the light

343
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:24,919
that is absorbed by a leaf is actually

344
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:27,278
used for

345
00:14:24,919 --> 00:14:30,039
photochemistry some of the light is

346
00:14:27,278 --> 00:14:33,000
actually going to be converted into heat

347
00:14:30,039 --> 00:14:35,240
and plants have the ability to control

348
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:38,360
how much of that light gets converted

349
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:41,560
into heat and that control is actually

350
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:45,320
based on that pH gradient that develops

351
00:14:41,559 --> 00:14:48,399
across the phid membrane inside of the

352
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:51,600
chloroplast so we're moving hydrogens

353
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:53,799
into the Lumen if a plant can use all of

354
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:56,519
this hydrogen to make ATP then we don't

355
00:14:53,799 --> 00:14:58,359
get much of a drop in PH right here but

356
00:14:56,519 --> 00:15:00,959
if the hydrogen transport across this

357
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:03,240
membrane m braan is faster than the rate

358
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:06,518
at which that hydrogen can be used to

359
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:09,839
make ATP then we get a drop in PH right

360
00:15:06,519 --> 00:15:12,078
here if that happens that triggers an

361
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:14,720
enzymatic activation with an enzyme

362
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:18,278
called VI violan and deepoxidase that

363
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:22,278
get activated by low PH inside of the

364
00:15:18,278 --> 00:15:24,799
Lumen Viola zantin deepoxidase converts

365
00:15:22,278 --> 00:15:27,198
Viola zantin which is a zenil pigment

366
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:30,039
that is present in the Chlor in the phid

367
00:15:27,198 --> 00:15:33,159
membrane it converts to ananin and

368
00:15:30,039 --> 00:15:35,799
subsequently to zantin and that

369
00:15:33,159 --> 00:15:37,838
conversion is reversible when the pH

370
00:15:35,799 --> 00:15:41,519
increases again the reason that this

371
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:44,680
conversion is important is that Viola

372
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:47,799
zantin is a pigment that helps

373
00:15:44,679 --> 00:15:49,719
chloroplasts absorb light and transfer

374
00:15:47,799 --> 00:15:52,439
that light to the reaction

375
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:54,360
centers when Viola lantin gets converted

376
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:57,560
into anos lantin or

377
00:15:54,360 --> 00:16:00,278
zantin these two pigments actually act

378
00:15:57,559 --> 00:16:04,559
very differently those two pigments

379
00:16:00,278 --> 00:16:06,879
cause um the absorbed light energy to be

380
00:16:04,559 --> 00:16:09,278
converted into heat they have an impact

381
00:16:06,879 --> 00:16:11,838
on the surrounding chlorophyll molecules

382
00:16:09,278 --> 00:16:13,318
and prevent chlorophyll molecules from

383
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:15,319
transferring that energy from one

384
00:16:13,318 --> 00:16:18,000
chlorophyll molecule to another and

385
00:16:15,318 --> 00:16:19,879
instead that energy now is lost as heat

386
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,759
that may seem like a bad thing but this

387
00:16:19,879 --> 00:16:25,399
is a way that plants can protect

388
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:28,800
themselves from excess

389
00:16:25,399 --> 00:16:31,278
light and then there is a third

390
00:16:28,799 --> 00:16:33,599
potential fade for absorb light energy

391
00:16:31,278 --> 00:16:35,000
and that is chlorophyll fluoresence this

392
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:38,600
doesn't seem to be something that is

393
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:41,480
actually actively controlled by plants

394
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:43,839
but it happens so um you cannot see it

395
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:46,360
but every plant that is exposed to light

396
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:48,920
is fluorescing it is giving off red

397
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:51,000
light with a wavelength of around 690

398
00:16:48,919 --> 00:16:53,639
nanometers you actually can see it if

399
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,600
you get a green laser pointer and you

400
00:16:53,639 --> 00:16:57,600
point that at a leaf you can see a

401
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:59,639
reddish glow where you hit that leaf

402
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:02,360
that is actually red photons coming from

403
00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:06,439
that leaf after you give it only green

404
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:09,000
light um so chlorophyll fluoresence

405
00:17:06,439 --> 00:17:10,839
turns out is actually really easy to

406
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,400
measure um there are very good

407
00:17:10,838 --> 00:17:14,918
techniques out there you can buy the

408
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:18,360
equipment not necessarily cheap but it's

409
00:17:14,919 --> 00:17:19,640
not difficult to do um so this is an

410
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:21,838
example here of a chlorophyll

411
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:23,640
fluorometer when we measure chlorophyll

412
00:17:21,838 --> 00:17:26,838
fluoresence basically what we are

413
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:29,720
measuring is how much light is emitted

414
00:17:26,838 --> 00:17:33,038
from that leaf um at a wavelength of

415
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:36,120
around 695 nanom and so this is light

416
00:17:33,038 --> 00:17:38,839
that is emitted that photon is created

417
00:17:36,119 --> 00:17:42,199
inside of the leaf it is not reflected

418
00:17:38,839 --> 00:17:44,558
that's a very different thing and so to

419
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:46,600
measure that we typically measure the

420
00:17:44,558 --> 00:17:48,918
fluoresence coming from the leaf under

421
00:17:46,599 --> 00:17:50,719
ambient light conditions and then in

422
00:17:48,919 --> 00:17:53,160
this picture right here you can see a

423
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:55,720
very bright spot right here where you

424
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:58,558
also measure the chlorophyll fluoresence

425
00:17:55,720 --> 00:18:00,279
when you give the leaf an amount of life

426
00:17:58,558 --> 00:18:02,200
that completely saturates all of the

427
00:18:00,279 --> 00:18:04,839
photosystems in that little part of the

428
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:07,200
leaf um and from those measurements we

429
00:18:04,839 --> 00:18:09,240
can actually calculate all kinds of

430
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:11,279
things and this is where we can get a

431
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:14,359
lot of in-depth physiological

432
00:18:11,279 --> 00:18:16,319
information incredibly easily I'm still

433
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:18,639
always a bit dumbfounded when I think

434
00:18:16,319 --> 00:18:21,200
about the biophysical processes that we

435
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:24,600
can measure so easily by shining a light

436
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:27,600
onto a leaf um so if you take these

437
00:18:24,599 --> 00:18:30,480
measurements on a leaf that has been in

438
00:18:27,599 --> 00:18:31,918
the dark fall while then you can measure

439
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:34,839
something called the maximum Quantum

440
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:37,679
yield of photos system too and that

441
00:18:34,839 --> 00:18:40,038
indicates whether that leaf is healthy

442
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:43,640
or not whether photos system to in that

443
00:18:40,038 --> 00:18:45,519
leaf has been damaged by heat excess

444
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:47,799
light salinity whatever it doesn't

445
00:18:45,519 --> 00:18:50,519
matter but you can detect whether or not

446
00:18:47,798 --> 00:18:53,119
was damage to photosystem too so for a

447
00:18:50,519 --> 00:18:57,319
healthy leave you're typically looking

448
00:18:53,119 --> 00:19:00,639
for a maximum Quantum yield of

449
00:18:57,319 --> 00:19:03,678
0.82 what that value of 0.82 means is

450
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:04,679
that under those conditions that leaf

451
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:08,919
uses

452
00:19:04,679 --> 00:19:11,440
82% of the light that it absorbs for

453
00:19:08,919 --> 00:19:13,200
photochemistry for electron transport

454
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:16,080
and that's the process that we need to

455
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:18,600
get transpiration uh sorry to get

456
00:19:16,079 --> 00:19:20,960
photosynthesis um we can take these same

457
00:19:18,599 --> 00:19:22,279
measurements on a Lea that is exposed to

458
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:24,200
light and now we can measure the

459
00:19:22,279 --> 00:19:26,399
intrinsic Quantum yield and light and

460
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:30,240
that is actually more interesting

461
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:31,798
because that actually tells us um under

462
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:34,400
let's say Greenhouse conditions if you

463
00:19:31,798 --> 00:19:37,558
do this in a greenhouse you can measure

464
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:39,440
how efficiently that plant is using the

465
00:19:37,558 --> 00:19:41,839
light that it is getting what fraction

466
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:43,400
of light that is absorbed by the leaf is

467
00:19:41,839 --> 00:19:45,720
actually used for

468
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:47,759
photochemistry so that in principle is

469
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:50,159
something that we would like to be as

470
00:19:47,759 --> 00:19:55,000
high as possible we want plants to use

471
00:19:50,159 --> 00:19:58,480
light as efficiently um uh as possible

472
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:00,679
if we know the quantum yield of photo

473
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:02,798
system to the intrinsic Quantum yield we

474
00:20:00,679 --> 00:20:06,200
can actually so that's going to be

475
00:20:02,798 --> 00:20:08,599
abbreviated as F PS2 the efficiency of

476
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:12,558
photos system 2 we can calculate the

477
00:20:08,599 --> 00:20:15,839
electron transport rate of photos system

478
00:20:12,558 --> 00:20:18,678
2 because we know the efficiency with

479
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:21,319
which light is used we can very easily

480
00:20:18,679 --> 00:20:23,519
measure the amount of Life of light that

481
00:20:21,319 --> 00:20:25,798
is getting to the leaf and we typically

482
00:20:23,519 --> 00:20:27,839
make the assumption that 84% of the

483
00:20:25,798 --> 00:20:30,200
light that reaches a leaf is going to be

484
00:20:27,839 --> 00:20:32,480
absorbed by that leaf that's a value

485
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:35,360
that is roughly accurate for a wide

486
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:37,558
range of different species and then we

487
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:40,678
multiply that by

488
00:20:37,558 --> 00:20:42,519
0.5 and that is to account for the fact

489
00:20:40,679 --> 00:20:44,159
that we have two photo systems and the

490
00:20:42,519 --> 00:20:46,279
assumption is that half of the light is

491
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:48,720
going to photo system 2 half of the

492
00:20:46,279 --> 00:20:51,599
light is going to photo system one and

493
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:54,159
then based on that um we can calculate

494
00:20:51,599 --> 00:20:57,319
the electron transport rate in in that

495
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:59,559
leaf and so we got all of that basically

496
00:20:57,319 --> 00:21:01,399
from Shining a light onto that leaf and

497
00:20:59,558 --> 00:21:03,000
measuring how much fluoresence is

498
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:06,080
emitted from that

499
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,960
leaf um the last parameter that I want

500
00:21:06,079 --> 00:21:09,798
to talk about that we can calculate is

501
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:12,919
non-photochemical quenching

502
00:21:09,798 --> 00:21:15,960
non-photochemical quenching is an

503
00:21:12,919 --> 00:21:18,120
indicator of um the activity of the

504
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:20,519
zenil cycle how much of the absorbed

505
00:21:18,119 --> 00:21:23,079
light energy is actually converted into

506
00:21:20,519 --> 00:21:25,480
heat so non-photochemical quenching in

507
00:21:23,079 --> 00:21:28,199
principle we would like to be low

508
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:31,599
because um if you get a lot of thermal

509
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:33,440
dissipation of light energy that means

510
00:21:31,599 --> 00:21:35,240
that the efficiency of photos system to

511
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:37,240
is going down less light is actually

512
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:40,038
being used for

513
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:42,240
photochemistry and this is calculated

514
00:21:40,038 --> 00:21:45,599
from the fluoresence that you measure

515
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:45,599
under that saturated light

516
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:52,080
bols um so our goal um we started on

517
00:21:50,038 --> 00:21:54,440
this about a year and a half ago was to

518
00:21:52,079 --> 00:21:56,879
develop a bio feedback system to measure

519
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:58,600
chlorophyll fluoresence then calculate

520
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:01,679
the electron transport rate and then

521
00:21:58,599 --> 00:22:03,798
adjust the duty cycle of the LEDs to

522
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:06,360
maintain whatever electron transport

523
00:22:03,798 --> 00:22:09,918
rate we program into the

524
00:22:06,359 --> 00:22:12,519
system so before we started doing that

525
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:14,679
um we needed to understand just what

526
00:22:12,519 --> 00:22:17,918
these plants were doing under LED light

527
00:22:14,679 --> 00:22:21,000
so we had um an LED light right here

528
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:23,000
with a power supply a plant below it a

529
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,640
fluorometer for chlorophyl fluoresence

530
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,919
connected to a Data Logger the Data

531
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:28,480
Logger is controlling the fluorometer it

532
00:22:26,919 --> 00:22:30,720
tells the fluorometer when to take a

533
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:33,000
measurement and it gets the data from

534
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:34,519
the fluorometer then and a light sensor

535
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,599
so that we can calculate the electron

536
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:39,400
transport

537
00:22:35,599 --> 00:22:41,158
rate um so we just collected data under

538
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:43,720
staty State conditions where we turned

539
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:45,640
the LEDs on this is a picture of what it

540
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:47,558
looks like inside of the growth chamber

541
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:49,200
this is a very early picture you can

542
00:22:47,558 --> 00:22:51,158
actually see the flickering nature of

543
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:53,278
the LEDs in that picture that's that was

544
00:22:51,159 --> 00:22:56,640
captured by the camera right here the

545
00:22:53,278 --> 00:22:59,038
stripes that you see is actually uh the

546
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:02,038
result of how the camera shutter is

547
00:22:59,038 --> 00:23:04,440
detecting the light and this is our

548
00:23:02,038 --> 00:23:06,640
rather ugly control system that runs the

549
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:11,278
whole system it's not pretty but it

550
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:15,278
works most of the time um so when we

551
00:23:11,278 --> 00:23:17,679
Expos these plants this was with lce for

552
00:23:15,278 --> 00:23:20,759
uh in this case this was 14 hours I

553
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:23,519
believe um to 400 micro moles of

554
00:23:20,759 --> 00:23:26,640
photosynthetic uh Photon flux what we

555
00:23:23,519 --> 00:23:28,879
see over the course of that period is

556
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:31,038
that the electron transport rate

557
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:33,200
gradually

558
00:23:31,038 --> 00:23:36,798
decreases and the electron transport

559
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:40,038
rate decreases because the efficiency of

560
00:23:36,798 --> 00:23:42,359
photosystem 2 decreases over time and

561
00:23:40,038 --> 00:23:44,759
the efficiency of photos system 2

562
00:23:42,359 --> 00:23:46,639
decreases because nonphotochemical

563
00:23:44,759 --> 00:23:48,879
quenching is

564
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:50,640
upregulated um as these plant are

565
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:53,278
exposed to these relatively High light

566
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:55,480
levels for lettuce for a prolonged

567
00:23:53,278 --> 00:23:57,919
period one thing that I do want to point

568
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:59,640
out though is that the scales here when

569
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:01,440
we look at the magnitude of the change

570
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:05,200
it's actually fairly small so we have

571
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:08,200
about a 5% change decrease in electron

572
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:10,519
transport rate the same for the

573
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:13,840
efficiency of photosystem 2 decreases by

574
00:24:10,519 --> 00:24:15,879
about 5% npq those values are just

575
00:24:13,839 --> 00:24:18,399
really difficult to interpret the number

576
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:20,440
itself doesn't mean a whole lot other

577
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:22,159
than that a higher value indicates that

578
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:25,919
more of the absorbed light is being

579
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:29,159
converted into heat Mark are those

580
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:32,120
24hour illuminations no these plans were

581
00:24:29,159 --> 00:24:34,320
under 16 hours of light 8 hours of

582
00:24:32,119 --> 00:24:36,199
dark um so when we look at the

583
00:24:34,319 --> 00:24:38,079
relationship between non-photo

584
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:40,319
non-photochemical quenching and the

585
00:24:38,079 --> 00:24:42,038
efficiency of photosystem too you see

586
00:24:40,319 --> 00:24:44,359
that there is a pretty nice relationship

587
00:24:42,038 --> 00:24:46,200
between the two so that uh is very

588
00:24:44,359 --> 00:24:49,918
consistent with the idea that the

589
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:52,038
upregulation of the zenil cycle um is a

590
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:53,759
mechanism that decreases um the

591
00:24:52,038 --> 00:24:55,319
efficiency of photos system too but at

592
00:24:53,759 --> 00:24:59,759
the same time helps to protect the

593
00:24:55,319 --> 00:24:59,759
plants against damage from exess light

594
00:25:00,119 --> 00:25:04,839
so um we have we had this system where

595
00:25:03,159 --> 00:25:07,440
we just had LEDs and we could measure

596
00:25:04,839 --> 00:25:10,558
the plans below them so we had to adapt

597
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:13,080
this system to actually give us control

598
00:25:10,558 --> 00:25:15,359
active control over the LED so the

599
00:25:13,079 --> 00:25:17,240
engineer that I mentioned previously he

600
00:25:15,359 --> 00:25:19,798
build us a duty cycle and frequency

601
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:22,399
control board um we can control that

602
00:25:19,798 --> 00:25:24,599
from the Data Logger um by sending a

603
00:25:22,398 --> 00:25:26,798
voltage signal using an analog output

604
00:25:24,599 --> 00:25:28,240
module to the frequency control board

605
00:25:26,798 --> 00:25:31,599
and now the data log

606
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:33,440
can tell the LED Lins basically what

607
00:25:31,599 --> 00:25:35,000
duty cycle should you maintain what

608
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:36,558
should the frequency be and I'm not

609
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,519
going to talk about frequency that has

610
00:25:36,558 --> 00:25:40,519
turned out to be a really boring aspect

611
00:25:38,519 --> 00:25:41,480
of everything that we've done it had no

612
00:25:40,519 --> 00:25:43,720
impact

613
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:45,599
whatsoever um but the duty cycle

614
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:49,480
basically when we adjust adjust the duty

615
00:25:45,599 --> 00:25:51,000
cycle we're adjusting um the light level

616
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:53,919
that we give to the

617
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:56,599
plants um so the question was can we

618
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:59,600
maintain a steady electron transport

619
00:25:56,599 --> 00:26:01,678
rate well well so we tried we actually

620
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:03,759
use a different lce plan this time but

621
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:06,840
we tried to maintain a stable electron

622
00:26:03,759 --> 00:26:08,278
transport rate of 70 micr moles per

623
00:26:06,839 --> 00:26:11,359
square meter per

624
00:26:08,278 --> 00:26:13,640
second um so that the 70 micro moles of

625
00:26:11,359 --> 00:26:18,439
electrons that move through one square

626
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:21,799
meter of leaf in 1 second and other than

627
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:24,159
the first few minutes we were actually

628
00:26:21,798 --> 00:26:27,000
able to control that electron transport

629
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:29,880
rate I thought very nicely we were very

630
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:32,440
happy to see this as I'll point out in a

631
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:34,120
second it was amazingly easy to control

632
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:36,519
the electron transport rate at 70

633
00:26:34,119 --> 00:26:38,519
micromoles though um but we tried

634
00:26:36,519 --> 00:26:41,558
different levels so this is a similar

635
00:26:38,519 --> 00:26:43,960
graph with higher uh electron transport

636
00:26:41,558 --> 00:26:46,480
rates it's a little bit more noisy but

637
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:48,558
overall we still have very nice control

638
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:51,079
over the electron transport rate so we

639
00:26:48,558 --> 00:26:53,798
have a way now that we can actually

640
00:26:51,079 --> 00:26:55,960
control the rate of the light reactions

641
00:26:53,798 --> 00:26:58,879
of photosynthesis by simply adjusting

642
00:26:55,960 --> 00:27:00,480
the Duty Cycles of the the LEDs one of

643
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:01,960
the nice thing about fluoresence

644
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:05,120
measurements is that you get a lot of

645
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:07,399
physiological information so this showed

646
00:27:05,119 --> 00:27:10,239
how the efficiency of photos system

647
00:27:07,398 --> 00:27:13,319
2 changed with an electron transport

648
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:16,960
rate uh set at 70 and the efficiency of

649
00:27:13,319 --> 00:27:19,678
photo system to is always the same there

650
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:21,159
was no down regulation um so what that

651
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:23,759
basically means is to maintain an

652
00:27:21,159 --> 00:27:25,320
electron transport rate of 70 micromoles

653
00:27:23,759 --> 00:27:28,398
per square meter per second if the

654
00:27:25,319 --> 00:27:30,000
efficiency of the leaf doesn't change

655
00:27:28,398 --> 00:27:31,798
you're always maintaining the same light

656
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,599
level and you're right there so you just

657
00:27:31,798 --> 00:27:36,000
turn the lights on walk away and you're

658
00:27:33,599 --> 00:27:37,959
actually fine um there wasn't any active

659
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,599
control needed one thing that was good

660
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:43,278
to see is that in the dark before and

661
00:27:40,599 --> 00:27:46,079
after the trial we got Quantum yields of

662
00:27:43,278 --> 00:27:48,720
over 0.8 and that indicates that these

663
00:27:46,079 --> 00:27:51,359
leaves were actually healthy and not

664
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:52,960
damaged um during this process I'll get

665
00:27:51,359 --> 00:27:55,599
back to that later but it turns out we

666
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:59,000
can actually cause severe damage to the

667
00:27:55,599 --> 00:28:02,278
leaves just by taking these measurements

668
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:04,919
so when I add the quantum yield of

669
00:28:02,278 --> 00:28:07,599
photos system to for the higher electron

670
00:28:04,919 --> 00:28:10,519
transport rates to this first of all you

671
00:28:07,599 --> 00:28:12,278
see that the efficiency is lower when

672
00:28:10,519 --> 00:28:14,558
you have higher electron transport rates

673
00:28:12,278 --> 00:28:16,798
when you give plant more light again

674
00:28:14,558 --> 00:28:19,480
they use that light less efficiently so

675
00:28:16,798 --> 00:28:25,558
we see a decrease in the quantum yield

676
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:27,640
of about 63 to maybe. 58 or so so the

677
00:28:25,558 --> 00:28:30,839
plants at this higher light level they

678
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:33,320
become less and less efficient over time

679
00:28:30,839 --> 00:28:35,359
so we also looked at nonphotochemical

680
00:28:33,319 --> 00:28:36,759
quenching what we see at the lower

681
00:28:35,359 --> 00:28:39,599
electron transport rate is that

682
00:28:36,759 --> 00:28:42,440
non-photochemical quenching is very

683
00:28:39,599 --> 00:28:44,398
boring and always the same when we go to

684
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:46,720
higher electron transport rates we have

685
00:28:44,398 --> 00:28:48,479
more nonphotochemical quenching than at

686
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:51,278
lower electron transport rates because

687
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:53,558
we have more light and at the same time

688
00:28:51,278 --> 00:28:55,880
we see that non-photochemical quenching

689
00:28:53,558 --> 00:28:59,119
is upregulated over the course of this

690
00:28:55,880 --> 00:29:01,840
day so the plant is inducing that zenil

691
00:28:59,119 --> 00:29:03,398
cycle activity to help protect itself

692
00:29:01,839 --> 00:29:06,158
from light

693
00:29:03,398 --> 00:29:08,199
damage and then ultimately when we look

694
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:10,799
at the light levels that were needed to

695
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:13,200
maintain these electron transport rates

696
00:29:10,798 --> 00:29:15,240
so this is the light that we needed over

697
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:17,960
this period to maintain an electron

698
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:20,079
transport rate of 70 so basically the

699
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:22,880
bio feedback system that we developed

700
00:29:20,079 --> 00:29:27,519
didn't have to make any adjustments

701
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:30,720
whatsoever um a light level of 240 micro

702
00:29:27,519 --> 00:29:33,558
m/ second was just um what these plans

703
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:36,360
needed um at the higher Target electron

704
00:29:33,558 --> 00:29:38,000
transport rate of 100 though we see that

705
00:29:36,359 --> 00:29:40,398
the biof feedback system needed to

706
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:43,759
upregulate the duty cycle and the light

707
00:29:40,398 --> 00:29:45,479
level to maintain a stable rate of

708
00:29:43,759 --> 00:29:48,440
electron

709
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:50,399
transport um so it showed us that the

710
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:52,759
system works that was exciting enough to

711
00:29:50,398 --> 00:29:54,158
see in the early days of this work the

712
00:29:52,759 --> 00:29:55,879
whole Lab group would come sit around

713
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:57,799
the lce plan in the lab and we would

714
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:59,480
just see what would happen next to the

715
00:29:57,798 --> 00:30:00,960
light we had hooked up to it and it was

716
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:03,599
actually really fascinating to watch

717
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:05,519
that plant basically adjusting the light

718
00:30:03,599 --> 00:30:08,918
to whatever level it

719
00:30:05,519 --> 00:30:11,880
needed um we were also interested in

720
00:30:08,919 --> 00:30:13,799
seeing what rates can we actually

721
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:16,600
achieve with this kind of a biof

722
00:30:13,798 --> 00:30:18,319
feedback system um we worked with

723
00:30:16,599 --> 00:30:20,439
different species I am only going to

724
00:30:18,319 --> 00:30:22,200
talk about lce because the other species

725
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:24,360
didn't respond all that differently so

726
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:26,519
it's not that interesting and we were

727
00:30:24,359 --> 00:30:27,839
interested in looking at what is the

728
00:30:26,519 --> 00:30:30,359
physiology

729
00:30:27,839 --> 00:30:35,398
that underlies the processes that U that

730
00:30:30,359 --> 00:30:37,798
we see so our goal was to maintain the

731
00:30:35,398 --> 00:30:39,319
electron transport rate of letters at

732
00:30:37,798 --> 00:30:40,839
different levels over the course of a

733
00:30:39,319 --> 00:30:42,359
day so we would increase the target

734
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:44,798
electron transport rate according to

735
00:30:42,359 --> 00:30:48,479
this doted line that you see right here

736
00:30:44,798 --> 00:30:50,319
going from initially zero up to 70 micro

737
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:53,839
mes per square me/ second and then back

738
00:30:50,319 --> 00:30:56,558
down again because we had each Target

739
00:30:53,839 --> 00:30:58,158
electron transport rate for only 1 hour

740
00:30:56,558 --> 00:31:00,678
we were colle colting chlorophyll

741
00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:04,639
fluoresence data more often in this

742
00:31:00,679 --> 00:31:06,360
study to give the system enough time to

743
00:31:04,638 --> 00:31:08,558
measure electron transport rate at a

744
00:31:06,359 --> 00:31:10,439
particular level and to make the needed

745
00:31:08,558 --> 00:31:12,519
adjustments in the duty cycle of the

746
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:14,200
LEDs to be able to maintain that

747
00:31:12,519 --> 00:31:18,759
electron transport rate so here we were

748
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:20,880
measuring every 2 minutes um and so this

749
00:31:18,759 --> 00:31:23,759
is the level of control that we got that

750
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:26,120
actually I thought looked pretty good

751
00:31:23,759 --> 00:31:27,599
where we can maintain these def electron

752
00:31:26,119 --> 00:31:29,439
transport rates pretty well so we

753
00:31:27,599 --> 00:31:32,678
reached a limit right here this plan

754
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:35,679
simply couldn't do any more than this

755
00:31:32,679 --> 00:31:38,000
and then going back down again we regain

756
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:39,600
control of the electron transport rate

757
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:42,000
but so one thing that you may notice

758
00:31:39,599 --> 00:31:44,199
here hopefully you didn't this is what

759
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:46,200
things didn't work the maximum electron

760
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:48,319
transport rate that we got was only

761
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:50,960
about 60 micr mes per square meter per

762
00:31:48,319 --> 00:31:52,839
second I just showed you in the previous

763
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:55,079
studies that we have no trouble

764
00:31:52,839 --> 00:31:58,158
maintaining electron transport rates of

765
00:31:55,079 --> 00:32:01,158
up to 100 micr per square met per

766
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:03,519
second um so when we looked at the light

767
00:32:01,159 --> 00:32:06,360
levels that were needed to achieve these

768
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:09,038
electron transport rates we see a

769
00:32:06,359 --> 00:32:10,638
stepwise pattern here we were maxing out

770
00:32:09,038 --> 00:32:14,119
the light that we could get from the

771
00:32:10,638 --> 00:32:15,759
LEDs and then it goes back down again

772
00:32:14,119 --> 00:32:18,199
but one thing that is interesting in

773
00:32:15,759 --> 00:32:19,919
this is that we needed a lot more light

774
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:22,159
to maintain a specific electron

775
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:24,038
transport rate during the first half of

776
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:27,120
the trial then during the second half of

777
00:32:24,038 --> 00:32:29,158
the trial so both of these lines

778
00:32:27,119 --> 00:32:30,879
indicate the light level needed to

779
00:32:29,159 --> 00:32:33,200
maintain an electron transport rate

780
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:35,840
right here of 10 micr per square me/

781
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:38,440
second but at the end of the day we

782
00:32:35,839 --> 00:32:40,959
needed almost twice as much light as we

783
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:44,038
did during the beginning of the

784
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:45,278
day and so our initial thought was well

785
00:32:44,038 --> 00:32:46,960
this is upregulation of

786
00:32:45,278 --> 00:32:50,038
non-photochemical quenching in these

787
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:52,960
plants we see the same difference here

788
00:32:50,038 --> 00:32:54,599
at an uh electron transport rate of 50

789
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:56,240
this is the difference in light level

790
00:32:54,599 --> 00:32:57,879
that we needed at this point in time

791
00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:00,599
versus this point in

792
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:03,559
time um so these plant were becoming

793
00:33:00,599 --> 00:33:06,278
less and less efficient over the course

794
00:33:03,558 --> 00:33:09,519
of this uh 14-hour

795
00:33:06,278 --> 00:33:11,398
period when we uh looked at the

796
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:14,200
efficiency of photosystem 2 or the

797
00:33:11,398 --> 00:33:16,479
quantum yield we see that during the

798
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:18,278
initial part of that trial the quantum

799
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:20,599
yield dropped which is what we would

800
00:33:18,278 --> 00:33:23,240
expect as you increase light levels the

801
00:33:20,599 --> 00:33:25,558
efficiency of photos system 2 increases

802
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:28,798
but the efficiency did not really go up

803
00:33:25,558 --> 00:33:32,398
a whole lot the second half of the trial

804
00:33:28,798 --> 00:33:34,599
until we actually turned off the lights

805
00:33:32,398 --> 00:33:37,278
so the efficiency of photosystem 2 here

806
00:33:34,599 --> 00:33:39,038
did not recover and when I took a closer

807
00:33:37,278 --> 00:33:41,119
look at these data another thing that I

808
00:33:39,038 --> 00:33:43,278
noticed was that when we look at the

809
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:46,278
quantum yield this initial data right

810
00:33:43,278 --> 00:33:48,278
here that's in the dark first of all

811
00:33:46,278 --> 00:33:51,000
these values are pretty low we started

812
00:33:48,278 --> 00:33:53,599
about 72 and then the efficiency of

813
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:56,558
photo system 2 was decreasing during

814
00:33:53,599 --> 00:33:58,240
that initial hour in the dark so that

815
00:33:56,558 --> 00:34:00,319
was actually indicating that our

816
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:02,759
measurements us measuring chlorophyll

817
00:34:00,319 --> 00:34:05,278
fluoresence was changing the efficiency

818
00:34:02,759 --> 00:34:07,960
of photosystem too and then at the end

819
00:34:05,278 --> 00:34:10,878
of the trial when we measured the yield

820
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:14,760
again here in the dark we only got

821
00:34:10,878 --> 00:34:17,719
Quantum yields of around 0.6 0.6 at the

822
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:22,359
end of the day and that told us we are

823
00:34:17,719 --> 00:34:24,598
really damaging these leaves um so this

824
00:34:22,358 --> 00:34:26,239
indicates a problem and we have now

825
00:34:24,599 --> 00:34:27,800
narrowed that problem down to the fact

826
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:29,479
that we were simply measuring

827
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:31,639
chlorophyll fluoresence too often and

828
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:35,159
it's a saturating light pulse that has

829
00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:37,240
an intensity of around 6,000 microl per

830
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:39,280
square meter per second that's a lot of

831
00:34:37,239 --> 00:34:41,199
light that is three times of the maximum

832
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:44,119
amount of light that you may get during

833
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:46,199
the middle of summer and exposing that

834
00:34:44,119 --> 00:34:49,320
leaf to that very high light level every

835
00:34:46,199 --> 00:34:52,118
2 minutes was actually causing damage to

836
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:53,800
that leaf so when we look at the changes

837
00:34:52,119 --> 00:34:56,039
in non-photochemical quenching we see

838
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:59,400
that non-photochemical quenching gets

839
00:34:56,039 --> 00:35:01,519
upregulated as the light levels increase

840
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:04,119
and non-photochemical quenching is

841
00:35:01,519 --> 00:35:06,358
actually nicely downregulated again as

842
00:35:04,119 --> 00:35:08,960
we decrease light levels when we try to

843
00:35:06,358 --> 00:35:11,319
maintain progressively lower electron

844
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:14,119
transport rates so non-photochemical

845
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:18,960
quenching could not explain the

846
00:35:14,119 --> 00:35:22,800
difference that we saw in yield um early

847
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:25,599
in this trial versus late in this trial

848
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:28,720
this is another way to look at this so

849
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:30,240
the solid symbol right here they

850
00:35:28,719 --> 00:35:32,358
indicate the relationship between

851
00:35:30,239 --> 00:35:34,598
non-photochemical quenching and the

852
00:35:32,358 --> 00:35:39,239
measured Quantum yield and we see this

853
00:35:34,599 --> 00:35:42,000
is in the dark um the yield decreases as

854
00:35:39,239 --> 00:35:44,078
nonphotochemical quenching increases but

855
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,880
then during the second half of the trial

856
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:48,000
as the light levels decrease

857
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:51,318
non-photochemical quenching decreases

858
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:55,679
again but the yield doesn't increase the

859
00:35:51,318 --> 00:35:59,199
way you would expect um so after I

860
00:35:55,679 --> 00:36:01,000
realized that this was was happening um

861
00:35:59,199 --> 00:36:02,679
we had a lab meeting to talk about this

862
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,760
it took us a while to figure out what

863
00:36:02,679 --> 00:36:08,480
was going on why do we not see that

864
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:11,200
yield recovering in the afternoon um

865
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:12,079
even though non-photochemical quenching

866
00:36:11,199 --> 00:36:14,159
gets

867
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:16,760
downregulated and then we took a look at

868
00:36:14,159 --> 00:36:18,440
the raw data from the fluoresence

869
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:20,000
measurements and so this is the

870
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:22,480
fluoresence that is measured under the

871
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:24,400
saturating light this is an indicator of

872
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:26,800
non-photochemical quenching the lower

873
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:30,838
this value the more non-photochemical

874
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:32,839
quenching and we see that uh stepwise

875
00:36:30,838 --> 00:36:34,559
pattern that is associated with changes

876
00:36:32,838 --> 00:36:37,838
in the electron transport rate changes

877
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:42,159
in light level and a recovery again

878
00:36:37,838 --> 00:36:43,679
later in the day um the next line This

879
00:36:42,159 --> 00:36:46,799
is the floressence signal that we

880
00:36:43,679 --> 00:36:48,719
measured on these leaves under ambient

881
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:51,920
light conditions without the saturating

882
00:36:48,719 --> 00:36:54,719
light pulse and what we saw early in the

883
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:56,358
day is that that fluorescence increase

884
00:36:54,719 --> 00:36:58,199
and that is normal as light levels

885
00:36:56,358 --> 00:37:00,400
increase inrease but during the second

886
00:36:58,199 --> 00:37:01,879
half of the day that fluoresence didn't

887
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:04,800
decrease back down again that

888
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:08,119
fluoresence actually kept increasing and

889
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:10,599
this indicates damage that we had caused

890
00:37:08,119 --> 00:37:12,838
to photosystem 2 by trying to measure

891
00:37:10,599 --> 00:37:15,519
chlorophyll fluoresence more frequently

892
00:37:12,838 --> 00:37:17,679
than these plants could handle so the

893
00:37:15,519 --> 00:37:20,159
way that that damage happens is through

894
00:37:17,679 --> 00:37:23,159
a process that is called photo inovation

895
00:37:20,159 --> 00:37:25,559
so under normal conditions you have an

896
00:37:23,159 --> 00:37:28,598
active photos system too that is capable

897
00:37:25,559 --> 00:37:30,039
of uh taking an electron from water and

898
00:37:28,599 --> 00:37:31,079
moving it on through the electron

899
00:37:30,039 --> 00:37:34,199
transport

900
00:37:31,079 --> 00:37:37,000
chain if you apply too much lie to

901
00:37:34,199 --> 00:37:39,078
plants photos system 2 can actually

902
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:40,880
become inactivated and it is actually a

903
00:37:39,079 --> 00:37:41,640
really ingenious mechanism through which

904
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:44,760
this

905
00:37:41,639 --> 00:37:47,199
works so if you have too much light

906
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:48,720
basically what happens is that too many

907
00:37:47,199 --> 00:37:50,879
electrons get taken from a water

908
00:37:48,719 --> 00:37:52,078
molecule these electrons normally would

909
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:55,480
be moving through this electron

910
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:57,039
transport chain but they can't in this

911
00:37:55,480 --> 00:38:00,079
case because there's so much light that

912
00:37:57,039 --> 00:38:03,279
was not enough capacity that electron is

913
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:05,400
going to react with something and in

914
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:08,960
this case what happens is that in

915
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:12,119
photosystem 2 that excess energy is

916
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:14,599
actually specifically directed towards A

917
00:38:12,119 --> 00:38:17,440
protein that is called the D1 protein

918
00:38:14,599 --> 00:38:19,280
that protein gets damaged and the plant

919
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:21,280
can then take that protein out of the

920
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:23,079
reaction Center of photo system to and

921
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:25,599
put a new one in but this takes a few

922
00:38:23,079 --> 00:38:28,000
hours so it is a slow repair process but

923
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:29,800
think about how genus this is when you

924
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:32,760
think about this in the context of your

925
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:34,440
car let's say you're driving your car

926
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:36,760
something goes wrong in the engine if

927
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:39,559
you had a smart engine that was as smart

928
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:41,079
as a plant that engine would direct

929
00:38:39,559 --> 00:38:43,279
whatever is going wrong in that engine

930
00:38:41,079 --> 00:38:45,280
to your first spark plug make that blow

931
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:47,160
up and all you need to do to repair it

932
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:49,079
is replace that spark plug no matter

933
00:38:47,159 --> 00:38:52,279
what that is basically what plants have

934
00:38:49,079 --> 00:38:54,839
done they direct all of that energy well

935
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:58,000
maybe not all but that directed energy

936
00:38:54,838 --> 00:39:00,599
to the D1 protein and then the plant

937
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:02,639
essentially knows what it needs to

938
00:39:00,599 --> 00:39:05,039
repair it's the D1 protein that needs to

939
00:39:02,639 --> 00:39:07,440
be repaired and obviously plants have a

940
00:39:05,039 --> 00:39:09,920
very efficient mechanism to repair that

941
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:12,920
protein because they know that that is

942
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:16,760
what uh is going to be damaged so we get

943
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:20,079
this photo inhibition plants can

944
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:22,599
reactivate uh photo system too but this

945
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:24,760
can be a matter of hours so what we saw

946
00:39:22,599 --> 00:39:26,720
in our trials we think we're pretty

947
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:29,640
confident about this is photo inhibition

948
00:39:26,719 --> 00:39:31,719
that was induced by those light pulses

949
00:39:29,639 --> 00:39:34,358
so what we do know from these studies is

950
00:39:31,719 --> 00:39:37,559
that we can control electron transport

951
00:39:34,358 --> 00:39:40,679
rate over a wide range of different

952
00:39:37,559 --> 00:39:42,920
levels and we can do it in many species

953
00:39:40,679 --> 00:39:44,358
I haven't shown that here because it's

954
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:46,200
not really interesting to look at the

955
00:39:44,358 --> 00:39:48,519
same graphs for different

956
00:39:46,199 --> 00:39:50,679
species when we do get high electron

957
00:39:48,519 --> 00:39:52,880
transport rates that is associated with

958
00:39:50,679 --> 00:39:56,598
a low yield and high non-photochemical

959
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:59,440
quenching so um we also found that that

960
00:39:56,599 --> 00:40:02,039
two frequent of measurements can result

961
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:04,519
in photo inhibition and what we do now

962
00:40:02,039 --> 00:40:06,639
is we measure that fluoresence under

963
00:40:04,519 --> 00:40:08,838
saturating light only once every 15

964
00:40:06,639 --> 00:40:11,400
minutes and that seems to be fine we're

965
00:40:08,838 --> 00:40:14,719
not seeing any damage from that but the

966
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:17,280
good thing is that we can actually see

967
00:40:14,719 --> 00:40:19,000
photo inhibition happening if we take a

968
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:21,720
close enough look at the data because

969
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:24,039
that photo inhibition should be evident

970
00:40:21,719 --> 00:40:26,480
from an upward Trend in the basal

971
00:40:24,039 --> 00:40:28,159
fluoresence that you're measuring so

972
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:29,838
this was part of uh of what we've been

973
00:40:28,159 --> 00:40:32,239
working on we have a biof feedback

974
00:40:29,838 --> 00:40:35,078
system and now that we understand the

975
00:40:32,239 --> 00:40:36,919
damage that we get from the measurements

976
00:40:35,079 --> 00:40:39,240
um I think we'll be able to run this

977
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:41,240
without causing damage from the

978
00:40:39,239 --> 00:40:43,838
measurements but we're working on other

979
00:40:41,239 --> 00:40:45,519
things as well and one thing that LEDs

980
00:40:43,838 --> 00:40:49,599
have done is they have actually

981
00:40:45,519 --> 00:40:51,159
generated a lot of interest in McCree

982
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:53,960
action spectrum of

983
00:40:51,159 --> 00:40:56,838
photosynthesis so this curve right here

984
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:59,280
shows how efficiently plants use

985
00:40:56,838 --> 00:41:01,279
different wavelengths of photons for

986
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:04,760
photosynthesis and it's normalized to a

987
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:06,440
peak of one right here so with LEDs we

988
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:07,920
can actually get very specific

989
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:10,800
wavelengths and there is a lot of

990
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:13,559
interest right now in trying to recreate

991
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:15,599
the action spectrum and see if this

992
00:41:13,559 --> 00:41:19,679
holds up under LEDs and see if it holds

993
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:21,079
up under different light intensities so

994
00:41:19,679 --> 00:41:23,318
because there was a lot of interest in

995
00:41:21,079 --> 00:41:25,240
this I'm not doing it all of people are

996
00:41:23,318 --> 00:41:28,199
and what I'm going to do is try to

997
00:41:25,239 --> 00:41:30,078
convince you that this doesn't work

998
00:41:28,199 --> 00:41:33,199
because that's much more fun I like to

999
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:35,039
be contrarian but so because the

1000
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:37,279
efficiency is relatively high in the

1001
00:41:35,039 --> 00:41:40,639
blue and red part of the spectrum and we

1002
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:41,640
have good LEDs in those uh wavelengths

1003
00:41:40,639 --> 00:41:44,920
efficient

1004
00:41:41,639 --> 00:41:47,799
LEDs the typical grow light now has a

1005
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:51,039
mixture of red and blue LEDs we are

1006
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:52,880
actually using some of these exact same

1007
00:41:51,039 --> 00:41:55,000
lights this is just another grow light

1008
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:58,079
but that has become the standard mixing

1009
00:41:55,000 --> 00:42:01,480
red and blue and some cases white

1010
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:04,200
LEDs but what Keith McCree in his

1011
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:06,440
groundbreaking work in the 60s didn't

1012
00:42:04,199 --> 00:42:08,239
seem to think about was even more

1013
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:11,200
groundbreaking work that was done in the

1014
00:42:08,239 --> 00:42:14,519
50s by Amazon so

1015
00:42:11,199 --> 00:42:16,759
Amazon is largely credited for doing the

1016
00:42:14,519 --> 00:42:18,400
initial research that showed that there

1017
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:21,160
were actually two different photos

1018
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:24,119
systems that work together an electron

1019
00:42:21,159 --> 00:42:25,879
transport rate and what emson did was he

1020
00:42:24,119 --> 00:42:28,240
looked at photosynthetic rates if we

1021
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:31,358
only GI plant light with wavelengths

1022
00:42:28,239 --> 00:42:33,439
greater than 680 nanom and what we found

1023
00:42:31,358 --> 00:42:36,119
was that you get very low photosynthetic

1024
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:38,480
rates and with what we know now that is

1025
00:42:36,119 --> 00:42:41,358
actually to be expected because photos

1026
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:45,079
system 2 can only use light with

1027
00:42:41,358 --> 00:42:48,480
wavelength of 680 or below well photos

1028
00:42:45,079 --> 00:42:50,640
system one can use light up to 700 nanom

1029
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:53,240
so with this kind of light you really

1030
00:42:50,639 --> 00:42:57,400
only stimulating photos system one not

1031
00:42:53,239 --> 00:42:59,279
photos system 2 so what Amazon also

1032
00:42:57,400 --> 00:43:01,440
found and I think we have failed to

1033
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:04,240
really recognize the importance of this

1034
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:08,639
is that if you gift plants lighted with

1035
00:43:04,239 --> 00:43:11,239
wavelengths only below 680 nanom and

1036
00:43:08,639 --> 00:43:12,598
that's this right here we also get low

1037
00:43:11,239 --> 00:43:15,159
photosynthetic

1038
00:43:12,599 --> 00:43:17,880
rates but that light can still excite

1039
00:43:15,159 --> 00:43:19,318
photosystem 2 and photos system one both

1040
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:22,039
but we still get only very low

1041
00:43:19,318 --> 00:43:24,318
photosynthetic rates and when we combine

1042
00:43:22,039 --> 00:43:26,239
these two lights then you get this right

1043
00:43:24,318 --> 00:43:28,838
here you get much much higher photos St

1044
00:43:26,239 --> 00:43:30,799
static rates much higher than using e

1045
00:43:28,838 --> 00:43:33,558
well than the combination of these two

1046
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:37,079
lights when used individually so there

1047
00:43:33,559 --> 00:43:39,760
was aestic effect of light below and

1048
00:43:37,079 --> 00:43:43,920
Light Above 680

1049
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:47,280
nanom um and the idea behind that is

1050
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:50,159
that I showed this slide before the rate

1051
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:53,280
limiting step in the electron transport

1052
00:43:50,159 --> 00:43:56,719
chain is right here where this electron

1053
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:59,720
needs to be transferred to uh a plastic

1054
00:43:56,719 --> 00:44:01,118
Kone right here and that will allow that

1055
00:43:59,719 --> 00:44:03,959
electron to move further down the

1056
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:05,960
electron transport chain so we often say

1057
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:08,679
that photos system 2 is the rate

1058
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:10,440
limiting step for the light reactions

1059
00:44:08,679 --> 00:44:13,519
and that is because photos system 2

1060
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:15,760
right here is not capable of donating

1061
00:44:13,519 --> 00:44:18,000
this electron to the plasticon pool

1062
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:20,400
right here if most of that plasticon

1063
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:22,440
pool has already been reduced there is

1064
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:26,119
only so much plastically

1065
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:29,519
known but um based on what Amazon found

1066
00:44:26,119 --> 00:44:34,280
basically what we can do is if we excite

1067
00:44:29,519 --> 00:44:36,800
photos system one more what we can do is

1068
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:39,000
reoxidize all these Downstream

1069
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:42,839
intermediates in the electron transport

1070
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:45,559
chain and if we can oxidize the plastic

1071
00:44:42,838 --> 00:44:47,838
kones right here then they can accept

1072
00:44:45,559 --> 00:44:51,200
another electron and photos system to

1073
00:44:47,838 --> 00:44:54,199
now is capable of transferring that

1074
00:44:51,199 --> 00:44:57,159
electron more efficiently and electron

1075
00:44:54,199 --> 00:45:00,199
transport can occur at a higher rate

1076
00:44:57,159 --> 00:45:02,399
theoretically so there goes the electron

1077
00:45:00,199 --> 00:45:07,598
all the way to

1078
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:10,240
nadph so um I told a graduate student of

1079
00:45:07,599 --> 00:45:12,720
mine about 10 days ago if she could get

1080
00:45:10,239 --> 00:45:14,959
me convincing data on this by last

1081
00:45:12,719 --> 00:45:17,199
Wednesday so she had about four days to

1082
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:20,880
do this I'll let you go to the light

1083
00:45:17,199 --> 00:45:23,879
Symposium at Michigan State and she got

1084
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:26,358
pretty motivated so she grabbed u a red

1085
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:29,160
and blue LED bar that has this from

1086
00:45:26,358 --> 00:45:31,078
right here and we have some Far red LEDs

1087
00:45:29,159 --> 00:45:36,199
sitting in the lab and she added

1088
00:45:31,079 --> 00:45:38,160
incrementally more um far red light to

1089
00:45:36,199 --> 00:45:41,199
it and then she measured photosynthetic

1090
00:45:38,159 --> 00:45:44,078
rates and she measured um the quantum

1091
00:45:41,199 --> 00:45:46,639
yield of photo system too and so this is

1092
00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:49,280
the far red LED right here it adds

1093
00:45:46,639 --> 00:45:51,358
practically no photosynthetically active

1094
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:53,319
radiation there was virtually no light

1095
00:45:51,358 --> 00:45:56,880
below 700

1096
00:45:53,318 --> 00:45:58,880
nanom so when she did that the Y AIS

1097
00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:00,599
here is really confusing because this

1098
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:03,119
data is so new that we haven't figured

1099
00:46:00,599 --> 00:46:05,760
out yet how we actually want to express

1100
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:07,760
this but this indicates the current that

1101
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:09,880
we were given to the far red LEDs it's

1102
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:12,559
basically the intensity of the far red

1103
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:14,960
light so it goes from zero with the far

1104
00:46:12,559 --> 00:46:17,359
red off to more and more far red light

1105
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:20,920
and then the far red light turned off

1106
00:46:17,358 --> 00:46:23,400
again and what we see is indeed an

1107
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:25,159
increase in photosynthesis that is

1108
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:26,400
disproportional to the amount of light

1109
00:46:25,159 --> 00:46:28,960
that we were adding

1110
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:30,519
so we have now made the great discovery

1111
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:32,358
that science da in the ' 50s was

1112
00:46:30,519 --> 00:46:34,639
actually right but I think we have

1113
00:46:32,358 --> 00:46:35,960
forgotten about the science from the 50s

1114
00:46:34,639 --> 00:46:38,558
and that's really the point I'm trying

1115
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:40,480
to make um it is really worthwhile to

1116
00:46:38,559 --> 00:46:42,800
look at some key papers from a very long

1117
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:44,920
time ago um because there is a lot of

1118
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:47,519
good information out there and what we

1119
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:49,200
were also able to do what Emison never

1120
00:46:47,519 --> 00:46:51,559
could do because he doesn't have the

1121
00:46:49,199 --> 00:46:54,000
equipment we looked at the quantum yield

1122
00:46:51,559 --> 00:46:58,680
of photos system 2 and it actually

1123
00:46:54,000 --> 00:47:00,880
follows a very very similar pattern but

1124
00:46:58,679 --> 00:47:04,519
the increase that we see in the quantum

1125
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:06,480
yield the photosystem 2 is actually not

1126
00:47:04,519 --> 00:47:09,318
as big as the increase that we see in

1127
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:12,719
photosynthesis so this by itself doesn't

1128
00:47:09,318 --> 00:47:14,400
explain the entire um effect that we see

1129
00:47:12,719 --> 00:47:16,879
on the actual photosynthetic

1130
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:18,440
measurements um we haven't had any time

1131
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:20,800
to look at this in more depth or to

1132
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:24,519
think about this a whole lot um I got

1133
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:26,119
these graphs on Saturday I think so um

1134
00:47:24,519 --> 00:47:28,119
but I think it's just interesting to go

1135
00:47:26,119 --> 00:47:30,880
back to that old literature and so there

1136
00:47:28,119 --> 00:47:32,400
was a lot of interest in mccree's action

1137
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:34,559
spectrum of photosynthesis and the

1138
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:36,920
reason that I say maybe it's not all

1139
00:47:34,559 --> 00:47:39,480
that important is that that action

1140
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:42,039
spectrum that McCree developed and it it

1141
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:44,039
was great work but it assumes that all

1142
00:47:42,039 --> 00:47:47,400
of these wavelengths are acting

1143
00:47:44,039 --> 00:47:50,079
independently and they don't we know

1144
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:52,720
from Amazon that far red light has a

1145
00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:55,200
synergistic effect and that becomes

1146
00:47:52,719 --> 00:47:57,358
really difficult to capture in an in an

1147
00:47:55,199 --> 00:47:59,519
action SP spectrum that might mean that

1148
00:47:57,358 --> 00:48:01,558
you need to develop an action Spectrum

1149
00:47:59,519 --> 00:48:03,039
with different amounts of far Red Light

1150
00:48:01,559 --> 00:48:04,680
added to it or something like that and

1151
00:48:03,039 --> 00:48:06,199
it's far red light the only kind of

1152
00:48:04,679 --> 00:48:08,759
light that has this kind of an effect

1153
00:48:06,199 --> 00:48:10,439
who knows we can't possibly test all

1154
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:12,000
different possibilities all different

1155
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:13,720
wavelengths of light because that would

1156
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:15,920
be hundreds if not thousands of

1157
00:48:13,719 --> 00:48:18,159
different wavelengths that you can

1158
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:20,680
combine to try to figure out what the

1159
00:48:18,159 --> 00:48:23,558
most efficient combination actually

1160
00:48:20,679 --> 00:48:26,639
is so we did see that far red light has

1161
00:48:23,559 --> 00:48:29,000
a COGIC effect so again that is nothing

1162
00:48:26,639 --> 00:48:31,639
new but it is I thought was worthwhile

1163
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:33,880
revisiting and it does increase the uh

1164
00:48:31,639 --> 00:48:35,759
Quantum yield of photosystem too it does

1165
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:38,519
make photos system 2 more efficient

1166
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:41,640
presumably because it helps to reoxidize

1167
00:48:38,519 --> 00:48:45,000
that plasticon pool that photos system 2

1168
00:48:41,639 --> 00:48:46,519
needs to donate the electron to and

1169
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:48,639
again wavelengths do not have

1170
00:48:46,519 --> 00:48:50,798
independent effects so how can we come

1171
00:48:48,639 --> 00:48:54,118
up with an action Spectrum for

1172
00:48:50,798 --> 00:48:57,639
photosynthesis um something to think

1173
00:48:54,119 --> 00:48:59,280
about so our future goals is to um try

1174
00:48:57,639 --> 00:49:01,719
to commercialize some of this bio

1175
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:03,920
feedback technology and I'm doing that

1176
00:49:01,719 --> 00:49:07,000
in collaboration with a local startup

1177
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:09,079
company called fyto synthetics um that

1178
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:12,079
was actually uh a company that was

1179
00:49:09,079 --> 00:49:13,960
started by two graduate students that I

1180
00:49:12,079 --> 00:49:17,720
had in a photosynthesis class that I

1181
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:19,480
taught um eight or 10 years ago we

1182
00:49:17,719 --> 00:49:22,000
talked about some of these

1183
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:24,199
ideas um they talked to their adviser

1184
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:27,960
about it he got a patent on the

1185
00:49:24,199 --> 00:49:31,679
technology with telling me about it

1186
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:34,639
um and the two students started uh two

1187
00:49:31,679 --> 00:49:37,519
years ago this company to try to get

1188
00:49:34,639 --> 00:49:39,598
this technology to Market so I'm now

1189
00:49:37,519 --> 00:49:43,119
working with fyto synthetics pretty

1190
00:49:39,599 --> 00:49:44,720
closely to um to do all of this uh so

1191
00:49:43,119 --> 00:49:46,358
one of the things that we want to do is

1192
00:49:44,719 --> 00:49:48,598
to build a lowcost chlorophyll

1193
00:49:46,358 --> 00:49:50,960
fluorometer that is done between phyto

1194
00:49:48,599 --> 00:49:53,798
synthetics and an engineering Professor

1195
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:56,599
the instrument we use costs

1196
00:49:53,798 --> 00:49:59,119
$115,000 um we hope we can build

1197
00:49:56,599 --> 00:50:01,119
something for $300 or $400 that would

1198
00:49:59,119 --> 00:50:02,280
make this a lot more appealing to

1199
00:50:01,119 --> 00:50:05,119
potential

1200
00:50:02,280 --> 00:50:08,359
users um so this is a picture of the

1201
00:50:05,119 --> 00:50:11,160
Prototype of uh the fluorometer you can

1202
00:50:08,358 --> 00:50:14,759
see the saturating light bus coming from

1203
00:50:11,159 --> 00:50:18,078
a laser right here shining onto that

1204
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:20,920
leaf um I hope that uh in the next week

1205
00:50:18,079 --> 00:50:22,640
or two they'll get me an updated version

1206
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:24,680
of this fluorometer that may actually

1207
00:50:22,639 --> 00:50:26,199
work um apparently it's not easy to

1208
00:50:24,679 --> 00:50:30,318
build a chlorofil

1209
00:50:26,199 --> 00:50:33,480
floma um I would like to uh thank janito

1210
00:50:30,318 --> 00:50:35,519
faresi he was the post do in my lab who

1211
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:38,719
built the very first iteration of the

1212
00:50:35,519 --> 00:50:40,358
bio feedback system uh Jeff Weaver who I

1213
00:50:38,719 --> 00:50:42,279
subsequently hired to work on this

1214
00:50:40,358 --> 00:50:45,239
project and who will hopefully become my

1215
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:47,720
PhD student soon um did a lot of work on

1216
00:50:45,239 --> 00:50:50,479
this Shu yangang Zen is a PhD student in

1217
00:50:47,719 --> 00:50:53,358
my lab she did to work revisiting the

1218
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:55,679
Emison effect and my current post

1219
00:50:53,358 --> 00:50:57,679
working on this Michael Martin the whole

1220
00:50:55,679 --> 00:51:00,598
Lab crew I would also like to thank Dex

1221
00:50:57,679 --> 00:51:03,279
and desier for getting this topic on the

1222
00:51:00,599 --> 00:51:05,359
radar um because again I don't think

1223
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:08,040
that I would have been able to get the

1224
00:51:05,358 --> 00:51:11,279
funding I got if it hadn't been for his

1225
00:51:08,039 --> 00:51:15,558
Pie in the Sky well corn in the sky

1226
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:17,240
views um so we may really disagree with

1227
00:51:15,559 --> 00:51:21,040
what he did but I think he has done us a

1228
00:51:17,239 --> 00:51:23,479
great favor in many ways as well um and

1229
00:51:21,039 --> 00:51:25,480
these are the various funding agencies

1230
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:27,519
uh that obviously I would like to thank

1231
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:30,639
as well and hopefully with that we have

1232
00:51:27,519 --> 00:51:30,639
time left for

1233
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:41,400
questions um if if you were lighting at

1234
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:46,119
247 and

1235
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:48,880
not and um if if you knew the level in

1236
00:51:46,119 --> 00:51:49,680
intensity you would not necessarily need

1237
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:53,920
a

1238
00:51:49,679 --> 00:51:57,639
dyamic uh control correct well so if you

1239
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:59,119
lied your plant 24 4 S um you may have

1240
00:51:57,639 --> 00:52:01,519
an increase in non-photochemical

1241
00:51:59,119 --> 00:52:02,880
quenching over time and you may be

1242
00:52:01,519 --> 00:52:06,280
decreasing the quantum yield of

1243
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:08,519
photosystem too so that may or may not

1244
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:10,960
happen but I I would love to see data on

1245
00:52:08,519 --> 00:52:12,639
that before I would make any hard claims

1246
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:15,119
about that I'm not convinced that you

1247
00:52:12,639 --> 00:52:17,159
would necessarily maintain a stable

1248
00:52:15,119 --> 00:52:18,720
electron transport rate if you keep the

1249
00:52:17,159 --> 00:52:20,239
plants in the light all the time and

1250
00:52:18,719 --> 00:52:24,318
some plants don't tolerate it like

1251
00:52:20,239 --> 00:52:25,838
tomatoes uh they need their rest at

1252
00:52:24,318 --> 00:52:27,960
night um

1253
00:52:25,838 --> 00:52:30,480
have you tried growing lettuce on the

1254
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:31,920
continuous light I never have and

1255
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:35,760
lettuce is fine with

1256
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:38,480
it yeah um it would be easy enough to

1257
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:41,400
find out if you have changes in Quantum

1258
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:45,199
yield yeah so no it is not a whole lot

1259
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:47,240
of light it is A8 second pulse so if you

1260
00:52:45,199 --> 00:52:49,118
were to integrate that over the 2 minute

1261
00:52:47,239 --> 00:52:51,239
period it's not a whole lot of light but

1262
00:52:49,119 --> 00:52:53,599
it is a whole lot of light that that

1263
00:52:51,239 --> 00:52:55,519
leaf has to deal with all at once and

1264
00:52:53,599 --> 00:52:57,680
that the leaf cannot do it's just it's

1265
00:52:55,519 --> 00:52:58,880
overwhelming the system do you have any

1266
00:52:57,679 --> 00:53:01,598
estimates

1267
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:04,599
of

1268
00:53:01,599 --> 00:53:04,599
fraction

1269
00:53:06,519 --> 00:53:13,000
Rel

1270
00:53:09,039 --> 00:53:15,519
backal no pretty small um yeah that most

1271
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:18,119
a few percent but so it's it's not

1272
00:53:15,519 --> 00:53:19,719
really everything it out doesn't take

1273
00:53:18,119 --> 00:53:22,318
into account that all of this light is

1274
00:53:19,719 --> 00:53:24,399
coming just in a very very brief burst

1275
00:53:22,318 --> 00:53:27,039
and that is more than the leaf can can

1276
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:30,519
handle

1277
00:53:27,039 --> 00:53:30,519
and doing that over and over and

1278
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:36,040
over yes simar to the first question do

1279
00:53:34,838 --> 00:53:39,798
you think

1280
00:53:36,039 --> 00:53:39,798
the has to

1281
00:53:40,639 --> 00:53:45,798
do um no I don't think so because when

1282
00:53:43,838 --> 00:53:48,679
we tried to maintain an electron

1283
00:53:45,798 --> 00:53:50,838
transport rate of 70 we saw a completely

1284
00:53:48,679 --> 00:53:53,480
flat line the quantum yielder photos

1285
00:53:50,838 --> 00:53:55,199
system 2 was completely stable so there

1286
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:57,760
was no evidence there of any kind of

1287
00:53:55,199 --> 00:53:59,399
Cadian Rhythm while at a higher electron

1288
00:53:57,760 --> 00:54:01,680
transport rate we see that that Quantum

1289
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:03,838
yield starts dropping over time so it

1290
00:54:01,679 --> 00:54:07,519
doesn't seem to me like it's the cadium

1291
00:54:03,838 --> 00:54:09,480
Rhythm that is involved yes um yeah

1292
00:54:07,519 --> 00:54:10,960
great question and plans definitely

1293
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:13,639
adapt to different light levels and

1294
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:15,559
Shang Zen um has done work on that as

1295
00:54:13,639 --> 00:54:18,279
well so if you grow plants under higher

1296
00:54:15,559 --> 00:54:19,839
light levels they will actually be

1297
00:54:18,280 --> 00:54:22,040
capable of achieving much higher

1298
00:54:19,838 --> 00:54:24,599
electron transport rates they are making

1299
00:54:22,039 --> 00:54:26,079
more reaction centers to help use all of

1300
00:54:24,599 --> 00:54:29,480
that light

1301
00:54:26,079 --> 00:54:33,400
there's definitely acclamation going on

1302
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:33,400
you see thisal

1303
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:41,159
application well so you mean the LEDs or

1304
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:44,160
so the LEDs are going on and off at the

1305
00:54:41,159 --> 00:54:45,759
frequency of 1,000 Hertz um you don't

1306
00:54:44,159 --> 00:54:48,199
see it you don't see that yeah but if

1307
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:50,400
you start to do it in a second or a

1308
00:54:48,199 --> 00:54:52,239
little more you'll see it yeah but

1309
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:54,119
there's no reason to do it at a at a

1310
00:54:52,239 --> 00:54:56,118
different frequency you can do it at a

1311
00:54:54,119 --> 00:54:58,798
very high frequency my understanding is

1312
00:54:56,119 --> 00:55:02,119
that it doesn't harm LEDs at all Tessa

1313
00:54:58,798 --> 00:55:04,400
may be able to uh corroborate that but

1314
00:55:02,119 --> 00:55:06,640
um so we're doing that already with a

1315
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:08,798
lot of lighting that we are exposed to

1316
00:55:06,639 --> 00:55:11,118
every single day a lot of this lighting

1317
00:55:08,798 --> 00:55:13,679
is being controlled using the same pul

1318
00:55:11,119 --> 00:55:17,200
withth modulation um

1319
00:55:13,679 --> 00:55:19,039
so uh there was other old research where

1320
00:55:17,199 --> 00:55:21,279
people were actually looking at how does

1321
00:55:19,039 --> 00:55:22,960
the frequency of the light affect the

1322
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:25,079
photosynthetic rate

1323
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:27,280
and there was a lot of really bad

1324
00:55:25,079 --> 00:55:28,920
science out there um but it turns it

1325
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:33,200
looks like there is no effect of

1326
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:35,880
frequency to speak of and um we've um

1327
00:55:33,199 --> 00:55:37,719
tested that as well that was really

1328
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:39,798
boring data if we keep the same

1329
00:55:37,719 --> 00:55:42,358
integrated light level and change the

1330
00:55:39,798 --> 00:55:43,030
frequency the plant does exactly the

1331
00:55:42,358 --> 00:55:46,679
same

1332
00:55:43,030 --> 00:55:46,679

1333
00:55:46,838 --> 00:55:52,558
thing this has been a production of
