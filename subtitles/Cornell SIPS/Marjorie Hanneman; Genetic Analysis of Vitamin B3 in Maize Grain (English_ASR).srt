00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,158
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:04,158
University

3
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:13,439
all right thank you Anna my name is

4
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:15,839
Marjorie hanneman as Anna said and I'm a

5
00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:17,460
second year in the gore lab and my

6
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:21,000
research project that I'm focusing on

7
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:24,420
today is the analysis of vitamin B3 or

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:28,018
niacin in Maize grain

9
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:30,240
to give a cultural context to vitamin B3

10
00:00:28,018 --> 00:00:32,519
and Maize we need to talk about next

11
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:34,460
stimulization which is a traditional

12
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:38,399
cultural practice

13
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:41,340
from Central America where the maze

14
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:45,000
kernels are cooked in lime and then

15
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:47,160
eventually ground to create a Masa to

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,159
make tortillas or tamales or other

17
00:00:47,159 --> 00:00:52,259
foreign-based Foods uh one thing about

18
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:56,578
this process though is that it increases

19
00:00:52,259 --> 00:01:01,320
the bioavailability of vitamin B3

20
00:00:56,579 --> 00:01:02,698
and in Maize diets whether it's the

21
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:05,400
predominant food

22
00:01:02,698 --> 00:01:06,959
there are uh

23
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,700
in cultures that don't have

24
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:12,539
nyximalization

25
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:15,719
we see severe B3 deficiency and diseases

26
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:18,900
such as balegra occur and that is

27
00:01:15,719 --> 00:01:21,599
predominantly because vitamin B3 is

28
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:23,820
mostly unavailable in the Maize grain

29
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:26,280
I have this pathway here showing

30
00:01:23,819 --> 00:01:27,978
nicotinic acid or niacin which is our

31
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:31,379
main form of B3

32
00:01:27,978 --> 00:01:34,799
and a trigonelling is the end methyl

33
00:01:31,379 --> 00:01:37,259
derivative of niacin where this compound

34
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:41,159
is inactive and undigestible because of

35
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:44,700
this methylation and in the majority of

36
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:47,600
corn kernels this is predominantly the

37
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:47,600
form of B3

38
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:53,340
vitamin B3 is also essential

39
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:55,740
specifically to the NAD cycle where

40
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:57,540
living organisms get the majority of

41
00:01:55,739 --> 00:02:00,419
their energy

42
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:02,460
I have the three compounds in the

43
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:05,099
previous side listed here showing that

44
00:02:02,459 --> 00:02:10,139
trigonelling is an offshoot of this uh

45
00:02:05,099 --> 00:02:12,659
this cycle more of a byproduct and uh

46
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:16,799
there's some thoughts that it's involved

47
00:02:12,659 --> 00:02:18,598
in a plant growth hormones but for our

48
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:22,620
cycle we're focusing on here is vitamin

49
00:02:18,598 --> 00:02:25,699
B3 it is inactive and is an offshoot

50
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:25,700
from the necessary cycle

51
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:30,598
so to further look into the B3 compounds

52
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:34,259
in Maize grain we used a high throughput

53
00:02:30,598 --> 00:02:36,419
lcms to phenotype these three compounds

54
00:02:34,259 --> 00:02:39,598
that I had mentioned in the cycle

55
00:02:36,419 --> 00:02:41,878
uh looking at about 1500 different maze

56
00:02:39,598 --> 00:02:45,179
lines we can see that there were three

57
00:02:41,878 --> 00:02:48,120
specifically that have extremely low

58
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:50,819
trigonelling and that would be the blue

59
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:54,840
green and red triangles uh specifically

60
00:02:50,818 --> 00:02:57,179
t232 which we will focus on is a reading

61
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:59,459
line out of Tennessee

62
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:01,680
it was the same three I have an elevated

63
00:02:59,459 --> 00:03:03,060
level of nicotinic acid or niacin the

64
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,860
active compound

65
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:08,280
and so that's suggesting that something

66
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:11,459
is happening between the nicotinic acid

67
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:13,199
and niacin step and trigonelli

68
00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:14,759
also interesting though is that for

69
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:17,639
nicotinamide they're all at average

70
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:19,560
levels so we're wanting to focus on

71
00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:22,699
specifically what is happening between

72
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:22,699
those two compounds

73
00:03:23,158 --> 00:03:27,060
and our main question for this project

74
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:29,519
is what is genetically causing this

75
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:34,340
extremely high niacin level and low

76
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:34,340
trigonelli level in The t232 Maze grain

77
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:42,959
comparing the t232 line a B3 composition

78
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:45,120
with B104 which is a fairly standard

79
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:46,979
line that we chose because of its

80
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,239
ability to be transformed

81
00:03:46,979 --> 00:03:51,179
you can see the difference in

82
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:53,939
trigonellian levels where it's basically

83
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:56,700
a sliver here in t232

84
00:03:53,939 --> 00:03:59,579
so choosing this average line in an

85
00:03:56,699 --> 00:04:01,859
extreme phenotype we crossed them and

86
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:04,680
self to make an F2 population so that we

87
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:07,379
can identify causal variants that could

88
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:10,099
be responsible for these unique rare

89
00:04:07,378 --> 00:04:10,098
phenotypes

90
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:17,220
within our F2 progeny this is a

91
00:04:14,759 --> 00:04:19,319
distribution of the trigonellian

92
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:21,600
phenotype and it's very interesting

93
00:04:19,319 --> 00:04:23,779
because you can see that there's a three

94
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:28,199
to one ratio here

95
00:04:23,779 --> 00:04:30,839
presence absence of trigonellin with

96
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:34,680
a zero absolutely no trigonelling

97
00:04:30,839 --> 00:04:36,899
compared to where B104 is where it is a

98
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:38,220
continuous distribution this would

99
00:04:36,899 --> 00:04:40,679
suggest that there's some sort of

100
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:43,800
genetic switch that

101
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:46,978
has a homozygous recessive allele that

102
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:48,840
is causing an absence of trigonalene and

103
00:04:46,978 --> 00:04:52,399
then to have a continuous quantitative

104
00:04:48,839 --> 00:04:52,399
phenotype for presence

105
00:04:54,120 --> 00:05:00,418
then genotyping our F2 population with

106
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:03,780
rhmc and then inputting it into an icim

107
00:05:00,418 --> 00:05:06,719
software we were doing a qtl analysis to

108
00:05:03,779 --> 00:05:08,519
look at the three phenotypes we were

109
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,440
interested in

110
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:13,500
now we specifically wanted to look at

111
00:05:10,439 --> 00:05:17,819
trigonelling where we had a very large

112
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:19,918
qtl on chromosome 4. and also seeing it

113
00:05:17,819 --> 00:05:21,899
in nicotinic acid

114
00:05:19,918 --> 00:05:24,799
so that would suggest that there is a

115
00:05:21,899 --> 00:05:27,899
single Locus that's going to be

116
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:29,639
associated with the niacin to

117
00:05:27,899 --> 00:05:32,879
trigonalene pathway

118
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:36,120
now nicotinamide also had a few qtl

119
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:38,819
Peaks but we are specifically going to

120
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:41,100
be interested in only nicotinic acid and

121
00:05:38,819 --> 00:05:44,659
trigonelline for now and look into that

122
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:50,000
later since it had more average

123
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:50,000
phenotypes for our extreme lines

124
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:55,680
this qtl was also about two megabases

125
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:58,199
wide with 51 genes in it

126
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:02,639
um and then we're hoping to narrow that

127
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:04,978
down and think and identify genes that

128
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:07,519
are specifically involved in a

129
00:06:04,978 --> 00:06:07,519
methylation

130
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:11,459
and specifically here is our NAD cycle

131
00:06:10,019 --> 00:06:15,319
again

132
00:06:11,459 --> 00:06:15,319
what is causing this to stop

133
00:06:17,339 --> 00:06:21,959
so for our next steps that this project

134
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:26,219
would be to integrate our qtl results

135
00:06:21,959 --> 00:06:28,560
with GEOS tus and eqtl specifically from

136
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:31,860
those 15 000 lines we originally looked

137
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:35,459
at to see if there are any genes that

138
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:37,680
would be hit here but because this is a

139
00:06:35,459 --> 00:06:40,318
rare phenotype it would be interesting

140
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:42,060
to see what else is going to be

141
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:43,919
identified

142
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:46,079
additionally we'll use orthologous

143
00:06:43,918 --> 00:06:48,959
information from other model plant

144
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:51,439
species such as arabidopsis to

145
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:53,758
prioritize our selection of possible

146
00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:56,639
causal genes

147
00:06:53,759 --> 00:07:00,538
then using de novo assembly of t232

148
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:02,519
genome we can identify the causal

149
00:07:00,538 --> 00:07:06,680
variants and see if they are also

150
00:07:02,519 --> 00:07:06,680
present in the other two extreme lines

151
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,879
and I would like to acknowledge my

152
00:07:09,779 --> 00:07:14,579
committee members and specifically the

153
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:16,978
gore lab and our collaborators at

154
00:07:14,579 --> 00:07:18,959
Georgia Michigan State and Iowa State

155
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:20,339
thank you

156
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:21,680
okay

157
00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:25,739
um

158
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:27,959
by parental population do you develop or

159
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:30,259
that you use do you know why you use the

160
00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:34,079
average line instead of another extreme

161
00:07:30,259 --> 00:07:36,120
that had a higher level sure so the

162
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:38,038
question was why did we choose an

163
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:40,860
average line to make the biparental

164
00:07:38,038 --> 00:07:43,680
population instead of using uh two

165
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:45,720
extreme lines that was because the

166
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:48,959
average line we chose B104 is

167
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:51,539
transformable and so then later down the

168
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:54,538
line we would be able to use that line

169
00:07:51,538 --> 00:07:58,139
to use Gene editing or something else to

170
00:07:54,538 --> 00:08:00,719
confirm uh causal genes I guess guys

171
00:07:58,139 --> 00:08:03,060
what do you know about the background of

172
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:06,660
the line and do you have a hypothesis as

173
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:08,519
to why this is so rare

174
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:10,020
um the background of the line was It was

175
00:08:08,519 --> 00:08:14,038
a

176
00:08:10,019 --> 00:08:17,339
tradition a breeding line from Tennessee

177
00:08:14,038 --> 00:08:20,279
um it was a non-stiff stock line all

178
00:08:17,339 --> 00:08:23,279
three of the extreme lines were not the

179
00:08:20,279 --> 00:08:28,378
same uh heterotic group though I am

180
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:32,658
thinking that this is a mutation in a

181
00:08:28,379 --> 00:08:35,940
single Gene and that could be

182
00:08:32,658 --> 00:08:38,939
uh resulting in that it continued

183
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:42,360
there's not seeing it in any other lines

184
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:44,640
could be because

185
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:48,300
there wasn't enough of a mutation to

186
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:50,879
have a selection over time

187
00:08:48,299 --> 00:08:52,679
so Kelly just add mutation doesn't

188
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:55,919
appear to be lethal

189
00:08:52,679 --> 00:08:58,559
but it's just occurring a very rare

190
00:08:55,919 --> 00:09:00,360
variant frequency so maybe like a more

191
00:08:58,559 --> 00:09:03,479
recent mutation or there's just no

192
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:06,659
selection I would say well probably a

193
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:07,740
combination of both yeah or if it did

194
00:09:06,659 --> 00:09:11,100
happen

195
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:12,778
uh say 80 000 years ago through fruit

196
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:16,500
drift it could have been lost but it

197
00:09:12,778 --> 00:09:19,159
probably occasionally occurs yeah

198
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:19,159
foreign

199
00:09:31,399 --> 00:09:36,778
the question was if the plant otherwise

200
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:39,060
looks the same because of the extremely

201
00:09:36,778 --> 00:09:41,338
low trigonalian lines uh specifically

202
00:09:39,059 --> 00:09:44,759
t232 there's

203
00:09:41,339 --> 00:09:48,060
um not anything obvious I want to look

204
00:09:44,759 --> 00:09:50,458
more into how does if trigonaling is

205
00:09:48,059 --> 00:09:52,859
going to be used as a plant hormone how

206
00:09:50,458 --> 00:09:55,739
does that affect growth they're one of

207
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:59,879
the extreme lines G14 though is very

208
00:09:55,740 --> 00:10:02,759
difficult to get seed from

209
00:09:59,879 --> 00:10:05,159
oh I'll I'll just add this this is a

210
00:10:02,759 --> 00:10:08,519
seed phenotype but we we haven't looked

211
00:10:05,159 --> 00:10:12,559
at in other tissues out outside of sea

212
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:12,560
so that's on yeah

213
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:17,820
is that chickenelling an

214
00:10:15,419 --> 00:10:20,458
anti-nutritional factor I mean is it is

215
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:22,920
it bad to eat outside of the fact that

216
00:10:20,458 --> 00:10:25,018
it prevents you from getting vitamin B3

217
00:10:22,919 --> 00:10:27,120
I guess but

218
00:10:25,019 --> 00:10:29,639
um not that I know of it's just

219
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:32,539
undigestable and unprocessable it goes

220
00:10:29,639 --> 00:10:32,539
through a human body

221
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:39,019
I don't know of any negative

222
00:10:36,179 --> 00:10:39,019
well thank you
