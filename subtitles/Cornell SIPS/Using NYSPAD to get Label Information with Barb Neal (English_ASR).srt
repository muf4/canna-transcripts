1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,339
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:04,339
University

3
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:13,830
this is a short PowerPoint presentation

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:17,820
on getting used to using the nice pad

5
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:20,310
website to get label information I hope

6
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:22,618
that you find it helpful so that you can

7
00:00:20,309 --> 00:00:26,098
fill out your Master Gardener sheets in

8
00:00:22,618 --> 00:00:35,369
order to complete the training in a few

9
00:00:26,099 --> 00:00:39,088
weeks so the first thing to do is to go

10
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:42,689
to the nice pad website the website

11
00:00:39,088 --> 00:00:46,409
address is listed up here and in your

12
00:00:42,689 --> 00:00:49,349
handout but you can also just google

13
00:00:46,409 --> 00:00:53,608
nice pad and it and you will come right

14
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:56,579
to this website what you want to do in

15
00:00:53,609 --> 00:00:58,920
order to get a label is to look to the

16
00:00:56,579 --> 00:01:01,878
where I've circled it in yellow under

17
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:10,109
pesticides information and press

18
00:01:01,878 --> 00:01:13,319
products that will bring you to the

19
00:01:10,109 --> 00:01:16,140
search engine part of the nice pad

20
00:01:13,319 --> 00:01:18,179
website the search engine is very nice

21
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:21,090
you can search by different categories

22
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:25,650
you can look for insecticides with a

23
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:28,079
specific lower toxicity level you can

24
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:31,050
find out if a product is restricted or

25
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:34,079
not it's very very powerful

26
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:36,019
but for us what we're just going to do

27
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:39,709
we're trying to find a particular label

28
00:01:36,019 --> 00:01:42,299
we're going to enter the label number

29
00:01:39,709 --> 00:01:45,030
we're going to enter the product EPA

30
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:48,899
registration number and to try to find

31
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:52,710
the label so what you do is you where

32
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:55,590
I've circled in red product EPA

33
00:01:52,709 --> 00:01:59,369
registration number we're going to use

34
00:01:55,590 --> 00:02:02,659
that pull down menu to choose New York

35
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:02,660
product number

36
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:13,019
so you pull down New York product number

37
00:02:07,978 --> 00:02:16,830
and leave it there and then enter your

38
00:02:13,019 --> 00:02:20,099
EPA registration number it can have the

39
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:23,550
dash number so where it says four two

40
00:02:20,098 --> 00:02:32,219
six nine seven dash sixty put the dashes

41
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:35,069
in then slide your mouse down to the

42
00:02:32,219 --> 00:02:37,259
bottom of the search page and to find

43
00:02:35,068 --> 00:02:38,939
that search button you won't be able to

44
00:02:37,259 --> 00:02:41,399
see it when you're putting in the EPA

45
00:02:38,939 --> 00:02:44,098
number it's sort of off screen so to

46
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:46,590
slide the website screen down so you can

47
00:02:44,098 --> 00:02:55,589
find that search button and then press

48
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:58,319
that if if it works you'll see this card

49
00:02:55,590 --> 00:03:00,989
so to speak that shows the the

50
00:02:58,318 --> 00:03:04,679
information of the product that you have

51
00:03:00,989 --> 00:03:07,409
put you put the EPA number in for so in

52
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:13,049
this case I put in the number for safer

53
00:03:07,409 --> 00:03:17,159
soap very common insecticide and the

54
00:03:13,049 --> 00:03:19,019
card shows you a few things one that has

55
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:21,049
of course the name of the product the

56
00:03:19,019 --> 00:03:24,870
newer product number or the EPA number

57
00:03:21,049 --> 00:03:27,689
the company and whether it's restricted

58
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:30,000
use or not in this case there's no

59
00:03:27,689 --> 00:03:32,639
restrictions which means that homeowners

60
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,799
can buy this product and use it if it

61
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:39,389
was restricted in New York that means

62
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:42,299
only certified pesticide applicators

63
00:03:39,389 --> 00:03:42,840
could use that product the second

64
00:03:42,299 --> 00:03:46,859
circles

65
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:49,200
it says Li use yes and that means the

66
00:03:46,859 --> 00:03:53,459
product can be used in Long Island in

67
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:56,238
some some products leach to to quickly

68
00:03:53,459 --> 00:04:00,598
through the soil and the sandy soils of

69
00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:04,409
Long Island you could have a potential

70
00:04:00,598 --> 00:04:07,259
for groundwater pollution so there are

71
00:04:04,409 --> 00:04:10,379
some chemicals that you cannot use in

72
00:04:07,259 --> 00:04:12,389
Long Island you can use them here in

73
00:04:10,379 --> 00:04:17,488
upstate New York but not in Long Island

74
00:04:12,389 --> 00:04:20,250
so that will tell you that in the square

75
00:04:17,488 --> 00:04:26,370
there's a button called more and you

76
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:29,129
press that to get the label once you

77
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:31,620
press that another more detailed card

78
00:04:29,129 --> 00:04:35,219
will come up with more information about

79
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:37,379
your product it has information about

80
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:40,200
what type of product in this case it's

81
00:04:37,379 --> 00:04:42,810
an insecticide it's used in home gardens

82
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:44,879
and ornamental plantings and I want to

83
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:47,879
point out that it also will have the

84
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:50,310
signal warning in this case it's warning

85
00:04:47,879 --> 00:04:53,100
it might be caution warning or danger or

86
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:56,069
I guess poison and the most toxic of

87
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:58,590
pesticides so that's a good thing to be

88
00:04:56,069 --> 00:05:03,170
able to find if you want to get the

89
00:04:58,589 --> 00:05:07,549
label you press the most recent label

90
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:11,189
date in this case it's four three nine

91
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:13,530
2017 so press that the blue highlighted

92
00:05:11,189 --> 00:05:19,829
numbers for the for the most recent

93
00:05:13,529 --> 00:05:23,729
label for this product and what will

94
00:05:19,829 --> 00:05:27,629
come up is a the picture of the label

95
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:30,270
for safer soap you probably if you had

96
00:05:27,629 --> 00:05:32,909
chosen this product to look at you would

97
00:05:30,269 --> 00:05:34,469
be seeing what's on the left and on the

98
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:37,979
upper right is the back side of the

99
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:40,470
label but inside once you purchase a

100
00:05:37,978 --> 00:05:44,459
product to kind of peel away this part

101
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:47,310
and you see the actual fine print so to

102
00:05:44,459 --> 00:05:51,060
speak of the label how it's used on what

103
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:54,030
insects the application rates etc in

104
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:55,949
this case you'll be your eyes would be

105
00:05:54,029 --> 00:05:58,500
better than mine if I could if you could

106
00:05:55,949 --> 00:06:03,349
read that so here's a little tip in

107
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:03,350
order to read the fine print of a label

108
00:06:04,699 --> 00:06:10,110
you want to swipe your mouse to the

109
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:13,200
right and sort of magically these three

110
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:16,080
buttons will appear if you press the

111
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:18,719
plus button it increases the font size

112
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:21,029
though you'll be able to read this fine

113
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:23,669
print and I actually like to use this

114
00:06:21,029 --> 00:06:25,889
because quite frankly a lot of labels

115
00:06:23,668 --> 00:06:28,978
they have to squeeze so much information

116
00:06:25,889 --> 00:06:30,389
into them that the actual physical label

117
00:06:28,978 --> 00:06:33,479
the paper label that's

118
00:06:30,389 --> 00:06:36,060
part of the cat the product is the types

119
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:38,430
really small so it is really nice to be

120
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:40,079
able to have this larger be able to

121
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:43,530
really read it you could print it out

122
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:46,229
and be able to study the label because

123
00:06:43,529 --> 00:06:48,000
remember the label is the law you have

124
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:51,300
to apply a chemical according to the

125
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:54,779
label whether it's organic or not and so

126
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:57,870
that part of what we want you to learn

127
00:06:54,779 --> 00:07:01,500
is how to quickly access the most

128
00:06:57,870 --> 00:07:04,050
important parts of information for the

129
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:06,269
label what's the first aid what's the

130
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:09,660
environmental hazards what's the product

131
00:07:06,269 --> 00:07:11,969
what kind of PPE protective equipment

132
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:13,800
that you need to wear in order to

133
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:15,930
protect yourself when using the chemical

134
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:18,810
those kind of things so we just want you

135
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:23,160
to be familiar with the aspects of a

136
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:25,199
label specifically with safety in mind I

137
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:29,060
hope you have enjoyed this PowerPoint

138
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:31,579
and good luck searching nice pad
