1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,839
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:09,058
University okay so I'm primarily a

3
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:13,320
vegetable grower and been working with

4
00:00:09,058 --> 00:00:18,420
cover crops for almost three decades and

5
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:20,969
so today I'm going to talk about kind of

6
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:22,920
a pastiche of different techniques that

7
00:00:20,969 --> 00:00:26,608
I've used on my farm for different

8
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:30,090
reasons and you know really the idea is

9
00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:32,759
is how on a intensely managed vegetable

10
00:00:30,089 --> 00:00:35,308
cropping operation can you fit cover

11
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:41,189
crops into where those vegetable crops

12
00:00:35,308 --> 00:00:43,140
are grown and and for myself personally

13
00:00:41,189 --> 00:00:45,449
I didn't start I didn't grow up on a

14
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:49,429
farm I grew up in suburbia and central

15
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:52,260
Illinois and I didn't go to school

16
00:00:49,429 --> 00:00:54,679
University in that and agriculture or

17
00:00:52,259 --> 00:00:59,128
even science for that matter I was

18
00:00:54,679 --> 00:01:01,259
English an Asian Lit major and so I

19
00:00:59,128 --> 00:01:04,228
really got into agriculture by by

20
00:01:01,259 --> 00:01:06,118
reading reading poetry really and so I

21
00:01:04,228 --> 00:01:08,429
thought there'd be a nice to start off

22
00:01:06,118 --> 00:01:11,760
with appropriate poem which talks about

23
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:14,280
cover crops really frost seeding by

24
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:16,170
Wendell Berry and it seems appropriate

25
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:20,960
now even though this is data in February

26
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:25,079
2nd 1968 in the dark of the Moon in

27
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:28,938
flying snow in the dead of winter war

28
00:01:25,079 --> 00:01:32,750
spreading families dying in the world

29
00:01:28,938 --> 00:01:37,618
danger I walked the rocky hillsides

30
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:42,359
sowing clover so Wendell here is a frost

31
00:01:37,618 --> 00:01:44,519
seeding covert and probably has a nice

32
00:01:42,359 --> 00:01:47,489
heavy clay soil which frost seeding

33
00:01:44,519 --> 00:01:49,859
works much better on than the farm where

34
00:01:47,489 --> 00:01:51,688
most of my farming experience came from

35
00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:54,649
southern New Hampshire and that where we

36
00:01:51,688 --> 00:01:54,648
had a sandy loam

37
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:02,969
know everybody today has been talking

38
00:02:01,379 --> 00:02:06,589
about all the beneficial effects of

39
00:02:02,968 --> 00:02:09,568
cover crops and green manures and just

40
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:11,640
just kind of reiterate some of them is

41
00:02:09,568 --> 00:02:14,518
the allopathic effects on the weed seed

42
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:17,969
bank interruption of pests and disease

43
00:02:14,519 --> 00:02:21,450
cycles elevated microbial activity in

44
00:02:17,969 --> 00:02:24,659
soils positive effect on soil moisture

45
00:02:21,449 --> 00:02:26,789
conservation legging family fix anywhere

46
00:02:24,659 --> 00:02:31,259
from 50 to 300 pounds of nitrogen per

47
00:02:26,789 --> 00:02:32,818
acre and the attractive capability of

48
00:02:31,259 --> 00:02:34,109
cover crops for beneficial and

49
00:02:32,818 --> 00:02:36,289
pollinating insects and of course

50
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:40,349
addition of organic matter to your soils

51
00:02:36,289 --> 00:02:42,090
to promote soil health so I'm just going

52
00:02:40,348 --> 00:02:43,979
to start with some profiles of different

53
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:46,079
cover crops on that and and these are

54
00:02:43,979 --> 00:02:49,709
really very common used in the upper

55
00:02:46,079 --> 00:02:54,230
north northeast winter rye our winner

56
00:02:49,709 --> 00:02:59,969
Ryan combination with hairy vetch and

57
00:02:54,229 --> 00:03:03,419
run through some photographs where I've

58
00:02:59,969 --> 00:03:07,049
farmed in southern New Hampshire up to

59
00:03:03,419 --> 00:03:09,780
Midcoast Maine there's a ideal windows

60
00:03:07,049 --> 00:03:12,359
for getting in some of these cover crops

61
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:14,340
as Thomas was definitely talking about

62
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:16,709
with some of the cover crops he was

63
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:19,200
talking about you know winter rye

64
00:03:16,709 --> 00:03:20,759
there's a pretty long period of time

65
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:23,189
that you can get your eye on from late

66
00:03:20,759 --> 00:03:25,019
August all the way into about now if you

67
00:03:23,189 --> 00:03:26,549
want to gamble a little bit but the

68
00:03:25,019 --> 00:03:29,039
window is much shorter for hairy vetch

69
00:03:26,549 --> 00:03:32,159
and I found that really mid-august to

70
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:35,189
mid September is the ideal time to get

71
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:37,680
that vetch in in especially in

72
00:03:35,189 --> 00:03:40,079
combination with your winter rye and

73
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:43,709
these two in combination over winter

74
00:03:40,079 --> 00:03:47,280
really well the kill time or the

75
00:03:43,709 --> 00:03:48,959
termination time for rye would be very

76
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:52,068
early in the spring if you can get into

77
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:55,139
the fields and with the tilling stage or

78
00:03:52,068 --> 00:03:58,530
allow it to get to full maturity and add

79
00:03:55,139 --> 00:04:01,790
to the pollen stage and then mow it at

80
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:01,789
the pollen stage

81
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:09,709
and with the veg component in that and

82
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:13,519
with tillage and there is a lot of

83
00:04:09,709 --> 00:04:16,608
tillage with vegetable crop rotations in

84
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:18,829
that the mineralisation they'll come off

85
00:04:16,608 --> 00:04:22,299
the rind batch will you know feed most

86
00:04:18,829 --> 00:04:26,509
of your cash crops for a midsummer into

87
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:32,800
into later in the fall so it's a great

88
00:04:26,509 --> 00:04:34,460
great setup crop with no the use of

89
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,860
winter rye

90
00:04:34,459 --> 00:04:43,099
it catches really nicely with just soil

91
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:46,479
moisture net and so for fall kind of

92
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:48,919
widely spaced single row or crops

93
00:04:46,478 --> 00:04:51,800
there's a great opportunity to get rye

94
00:04:48,918 --> 00:04:54,549
into your field while you're still

95
00:04:51,800 --> 00:05:00,560
growing your cash crop in this case

96
00:04:54,550 --> 00:05:03,710
broccoli transplanted in August and the

97
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:07,728
Rye is just spun on in mid-september

98
00:05:03,709 --> 00:05:11,120
it's critical that your your broccoli

99
00:05:07,728 --> 00:05:13,598
planning is clean from weeds and that

100
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:16,038
but you don't need to press it in or

101
00:05:13,598 --> 00:05:17,689
cultivate it in and that you can just

102
00:05:16,038 --> 00:05:21,939
spin it on with the moisture net you can

103
00:05:17,689 --> 00:05:25,038
get a pretty good catch on most years

104
00:05:21,939 --> 00:05:27,050
broccoli will continue and the growth

105
00:05:25,038 --> 00:05:30,199
slows down in that shaded area where the

106
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:33,560
where the broccoli is and then much

107
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:35,538
later after Rocky's been cut off and

108
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:38,060
this case this feel it's much too wet to

109
00:05:35,538 --> 00:05:39,769
get in there with implementing that have

110
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:42,189
a nice stand of winter rye to get you

111
00:05:39,769 --> 00:05:42,189
through the winter

112
00:05:43,949 --> 00:05:51,629
I learned this trick from Thomas from

113
00:05:48,899 --> 00:05:55,408
his website and that and that is that

114
00:05:51,629 --> 00:05:58,439
sometimes you have a field where you

115
00:05:55,408 --> 00:06:00,899
didn't get a cover crop in in in the

116
00:05:58,439 --> 00:06:02,430
late fall in the winter it's bare it

117
00:06:00,899 --> 00:06:05,698
could be weedy

118
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:11,550
and you schedule something that would go

119
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:13,020
in there say and in June that that kind

120
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:15,120
of bare window of time it's a great time

121
00:06:13,019 --> 00:06:17,490
to put down some cheap seed like rye and

122
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:19,259
you'll flush some annual weeds through

123
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:21,990
that you'll kind of stimulate the

124
00:06:19,259 --> 00:06:25,710
microbial soil life and that with that

125
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:27,389
rye and and also it will be scavenging

126
00:06:25,709 --> 00:06:29,519
some leftover nitrogen than that so you

127
00:06:27,389 --> 00:06:32,579
can use this rice really like a starter

128
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:35,430
fertilizer the trick is not to let it

129
00:06:32,579 --> 00:06:40,769
get very much growth four to six inches

130
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:43,620
and then the tillage don't need

131
00:06:40,769 --> 00:06:45,718
aggressive tillage analogies the perfect

132
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:47,848
to pass the perfect of the field was

133
00:06:45,718 --> 00:06:52,918
ready to go and then I was able to

134
00:06:47,848 --> 00:06:54,750
transplant summer summer squash and in

135
00:06:52,918 --> 00:06:56,310
winter squash and this little block here

136
00:06:54,750 --> 00:07:02,879
but to basically use it as a bio

137
00:06:56,310 --> 00:07:06,468
stimulant and in a weed suppressant for

138
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:06,468
many years of work with the idea of

139
00:07:06,769 --> 00:07:13,430
obstruent of rye over whenever Ryan veg

140
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:15,810
and instead of using a crimper and app

141
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:17,550
which will kind of kill your Ryan

142
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:20,338
veteran app but the ground stays kind of

143
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:22,918
cool in a crimper most of my farming

144
00:07:20,338 --> 00:07:24,810
experience is a little further north in

145
00:07:22,918 --> 00:07:28,468
the Northeast and I want that soil to

146
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:32,218
warm up in that for what I intend to put

147
00:07:28,468 --> 00:07:33,228
into these strips and that so I I would

148
00:07:32,218 --> 00:07:36,990
with a Spader

149
00:07:33,228 --> 00:07:38,788
early in the spring cut strips in my

150
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:43,110
field of overwinter dry and vetch

151
00:07:38,788 --> 00:07:45,329
and then is able to direct seed winter

152
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:47,580
squash our pumpkins and the alternating

153
00:07:45,329 --> 00:07:50,128
strips what strips are wide enough that

154
00:07:47,579 --> 00:07:52,680
that soil gets warm before I put the

155
00:07:50,129 --> 00:07:55,870
seed in and I let the right vet continue

156
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:58,360
to grow so I'm getting a fair amount of

157
00:07:55,870 --> 00:08:00,660
some straw mulch from that and then then

158
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:03,460
at that termination time which is the

159
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:06,640
the winner dry and a pollen stage and

160
00:08:03,459 --> 00:08:08,289
vetch we gain to the flower this case is

161
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:15,870
probably a little bit far advanced and

162
00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:19,840
that mow it down and you have a nice

163
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:22,780
straw between your between your beds of

164
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:24,879
winter squash our pumpkins still able to

165
00:08:22,779 --> 00:08:28,299
cultivate the pumpkins the grounds warm

166
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:31,779
there and then and then kind of

167
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:34,419
refinement of this technique if I want

168
00:08:31,779 --> 00:08:36,819
to get a fall cover crop in the field as

169
00:08:34,419 --> 00:08:39,219
hard to get a cover crop in when at the

170
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:43,680
time with the squash and pumpkins would

171
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:47,950
come off in mid late September in that

172
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:51,250
using the it's kind of establishing

173
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:54,100
living mulch strips of medium red clover

174
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:56,830
and so just at the stage of where the

175
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:59,409
tendrils start to move out on the

176
00:08:56,830 --> 00:09:04,270
pumpkin plants here and that movement is

177
00:08:59,409 --> 00:09:07,000
very quick I'll do a shallow tillage and

178
00:09:04,269 --> 00:09:08,740
then drop clover seed in it's very

179
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,360
important that there's moisture to soil

180
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:14,370
to get good germination the color Packer

181
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:18,220
press that seed in it'll germinate

182
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:21,940
different field same thing and then the

183
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:23,889
the broad leaves from the pumpkins or

184
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:26,530
winter squash and that shade that clover

185
00:09:23,889 --> 00:09:28,990
so the shape the clover doesn't really

186
00:09:26,529 --> 00:09:33,819
interfere with the growth of the winter

187
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:35,649
squash and that and then as the squash

188
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:37,900
and pumpkins comes out of the field in

189
00:09:35,649 --> 00:09:40,600
that very important to get it out of the

190
00:09:37,899 --> 00:09:44,110
field as quickly as you can mow off that

191
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:49,330
that crop residue and that so the the

192
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:51,039
clover strips can get light and then

193
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:52,930
you're in the fall I'm it's that you

194
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:55,149
know I get my my fall cover crop

195
00:09:52,929 --> 00:09:58,539
established but it was seeded back in

196
00:09:55,149 --> 00:10:00,159
July and with the liberation of light to

197
00:09:58,539 --> 00:10:03,849
the clover net then it'll fill in this

198
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:05,740
fill in the field and that different

199
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:09,250
field here at butternut same thing the

200
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:12,610
butternuts come out strips are there

201
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:17,289
and here we are in November and then

202
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:22,688
that clover has filled in the field and

203
00:10:17,289 --> 00:10:26,528
then next spring yet you know really

204
00:10:22,688 --> 00:10:27,849
nice clean stand of clover and yet in

205
00:10:26,528 --> 00:10:29,799
the nitrogen that's coming off that

206
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:31,449
clover and then I'll flip families on

207
00:10:29,799 --> 00:10:34,979
that so I'm using establishment with a

208
00:10:31,448 --> 00:10:38,128
cubit family and they'll cut strips in

209
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:40,480
that field of red clover and I'm

210
00:10:38,129 --> 00:10:42,069
transplanting Tomatoes it's kind of hard

211
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:45,699
to see the tomato plants very small on

212
00:10:42,068 --> 00:10:47,349
this slide and and and so I'm just kind

213
00:10:45,698 --> 00:10:49,419
of changing plant families and I use the

214
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:51,870
clover it's a straw mulch for the

215
00:10:49,419 --> 00:10:51,870
tomatoes

216
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:57,850
Johnny's you know they were a little

217
00:10:55,470 --> 00:11:01,509
hesitant to see some of these techniques

218
00:10:57,850 --> 00:11:02,680
brought on to their farm so you're just

219
00:11:01,509 --> 00:11:05,318
kind of like a little bit of refinement

220
00:11:02,679 --> 00:11:07,299
this technique this is last spring in

221
00:11:05,318 --> 00:11:09,448
that on fields there's a lot of crop

222
00:11:07,299 --> 00:11:14,679
residue we've got the plastic out and

223
00:11:09,448 --> 00:11:17,649
and basically Herald a field marked

224
00:11:14,679 --> 00:11:19,958
marked all my beds and then any bed that

225
00:11:17,649 --> 00:11:27,759
I was going to have on plastic plastic

226
00:11:19,958 --> 00:11:33,308
whoops plastic mulch i seated seated all

227
00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:35,740
in any strips to oats and in medium

228
00:11:33,308 --> 00:11:37,419
medium red clover the oats is a nurse

229
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:40,139
crop for the clover use a collie part

230
00:11:37,419 --> 00:11:42,909
pack it in and then I continued with the

231
00:11:40,139 --> 00:11:45,459
spot transplanting in the areas that

232
00:11:42,909 --> 00:11:47,649
we're gonna that are in the plastic

233
00:11:45,458 --> 00:11:54,789
mulch in that as those crops are

234
00:11:47,649 --> 00:11:57,429
available and then manage them by mowing

235
00:11:54,789 --> 00:11:59,679
it and also you're flushing a lot of the

236
00:11:57,429 --> 00:12:01,838
annual weed seats of the clover so it's

237
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:04,479
a technique you're managing your weed

238
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:06,339
seed bank with the clover and again

239
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:10,149
there's no bare soil here there's no

240
00:12:06,339 --> 00:12:12,759
bare soil cultivation that but the

241
00:12:10,149 --> 00:12:14,889
clover is not interfering with you know

242
00:12:12,759 --> 00:12:19,600
your cash crop in this place in this

243
00:12:14,889 --> 00:12:22,899
case eggplant and then here we are early

244
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:24,430
October taking the plastic out

245
00:12:22,899 --> 00:12:25,899
not easy you know there's really not an

246
00:12:24,429 --> 00:12:28,058
easy way to get that plastic out in this

247
00:12:25,899 --> 00:12:30,730
case I was using bio teller but in other

248
00:12:28,058 --> 00:12:32,350
fields you're using kind of non bio

249
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:34,659
telecom to conventional plastic mulch

250
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:37,058
but getting that plastic out and then

251
00:12:34,659 --> 00:12:40,480
with what the light and that migrates in

252
00:12:37,058 --> 00:12:43,928
and so there's no fall tillage and you

253
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:47,709
have a good stand of clover in that in

254
00:12:43,928 --> 00:12:50,678
that field and then modification of this

255
00:12:47,708 --> 00:12:52,419
in tomatoes this is a johnie's and that

256
00:12:50,678 --> 00:12:56,198
same thing basically start off with a

257
00:12:52,419 --> 00:12:59,039
bare soil seed your your oats and medium

258
00:12:56,198 --> 00:13:01,868
red clover and then here we're using

259
00:12:59,039 --> 00:13:03,669
straw mulch instead of plastic so this

260
00:13:01,869 --> 00:13:08,290
is straw mulch that we had bailed at our

261
00:13:03,669 --> 00:13:10,868
farm and first the clover notes are

262
00:13:08,289 --> 00:13:13,509
established and then we transplant the

263
00:13:10,869 --> 00:13:15,790
tomatoes and the bare soil important for

264
00:13:13,509 --> 00:13:20,829
that bare soil to be warm so the soil

265
00:13:15,789 --> 00:13:24,028
can warm up where we are and then then

266
00:13:20,828 --> 00:13:26,588
bring the mulch into the tomato plants

267
00:13:24,028 --> 00:13:30,220
you can see the straw mulch with the

268
00:13:26,589 --> 00:13:32,559
with the clover strips and then the

269
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:34,149
management again with mowing and that so

270
00:13:32,558 --> 00:13:37,539
we're flushing or annual weeds through

271
00:13:34,149 --> 00:13:39,278
there but what I liked about this with

272
00:13:37,539 --> 00:13:42,039
the straw mulch and saw the plastic with

273
00:13:39,278 --> 00:13:43,899
a plastic we'd have a little weed kind

274
00:13:42,039 --> 00:13:45,669
of a weed strip right on that edge a net

275
00:13:43,899 --> 00:13:48,009
and created a kind of a challenge for

276
00:13:45,669 --> 00:13:50,438
managing those weeds on that strip but

277
00:13:48,009 --> 00:13:56,230
with the with the straw mulch and that I

278
00:13:50,438 --> 00:14:00,009
could drive my tractor tire onto that

279
00:13:56,230 --> 00:14:01,600
onto that straw and and I you know the

280
00:14:00,009 --> 00:14:03,220
management of the weeds and that end

281
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:05,499
that field with the straw instead of the

282
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:07,540
plastic and that was phenomenally faster

283
00:14:05,499 --> 00:14:09,909
just run that mower through the Eric and

284
00:14:07,539 --> 00:14:12,039
run it right up on the straw and have

285
00:14:09,909 --> 00:14:14,678
nice airflow good harvest aisles for the

286
00:14:12,039 --> 00:14:18,068
tomatoes a net you notice how they would

287
00:14:14,678 --> 00:14:20,188
you know well-established field and then

288
00:14:18,068 --> 00:14:22,568
and then in the fall

289
00:14:20,188 --> 00:14:27,068
take out the stakes and the string

290
00:14:22,568 --> 00:14:28,928
tomatoes mow it and and then you have

291
00:14:27,068 --> 00:14:32,078
kind of straw and I found that the I

292
00:14:28,928 --> 00:14:33,818
didn't get the the migration of the

293
00:14:32,078 --> 00:14:35,859
clover into the straw it really seemed

294
00:14:33,818 --> 00:14:36,639
to impede a little bit I think if we use

295
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:38,230
less straw

296
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:41,049
probably get better migration of it but

297
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:42,970
point is is that a nice cover going into

298
00:14:41,049 --> 00:14:45,009
the winter and good stands of clover

299
00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:47,170
then this this year we planted our

300
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:48,509
winter squash and pumpkin nursery into

301
00:14:47,169 --> 00:14:51,909
those clover strips without any

302
00:14:48,509 --> 00:14:53,980
additional fertilizer natin had a you

303
00:14:51,909 --> 00:14:57,459
know a hundred a crop of that had very

304
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:59,409
good crops of pumpkins and winter squash

305
00:14:57,460 --> 00:15:01,570
from the clover that was established the

306
00:14:59,409 --> 00:15:03,399
previous year but you know the key is

307
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:06,490
that there is almost no tillage for two

308
00:15:03,399 --> 00:15:08,769
years and almost no bare soil for two

309
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:13,750
years once you do the initial setup of

310
00:15:08,769 --> 00:15:15,939
the field in that and so it works well

311
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:18,190
on you know crops like sunflowers cut

312
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:20,980
flowers again we're flushing annual

313
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:25,380
weeds through the clover just wider

314
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:29,100
spacing and after a couple of mowings

315
00:15:25,379 --> 00:15:31,570
the in that case the amaranth is gone I

316
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:35,740
found this technique works really well

317
00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:39,310
for a gallon saga I've read that the

318
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:41,980
gallon Saugus seed has a very short term

319
00:15:39,309 --> 00:15:46,119
viability about a year and a half and so

320
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:48,909
if you have fields that are infested

321
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:50,799
with gallon Soga if you can shut off all

322
00:15:48,909 --> 00:15:53,019
kind of cultivation and tillage for two

323
00:15:50,799 --> 00:15:55,659
seasons you can really blow a hole in

324
00:15:53,019 --> 00:15:57,340
your weed seed bank a viable gallon

325
00:15:55,659 --> 00:15:59,559
soldier seed so if you can use this

326
00:15:57,340 --> 00:16:01,899
technique with the clover and at the

327
00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:03,699
gallon so go we'll just it'll head out

328
00:16:01,899 --> 00:16:05,949
just above the clover and so you just

329
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:07,750
mow it you just clip off those heads do

330
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:10,780
it four or five times and then there you

331
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:13,360
know then you can you know there'll be

332
00:16:10,779 --> 00:16:17,529
no gallon saga in that field plus all

333
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:19,810
the weeds I mean the clover seed and I'm

334
00:16:17,529 --> 00:16:22,480
sorry the the gallon so see that's in

335
00:16:19,809 --> 00:16:25,000
the soil that is breaking down a net so

336
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:27,100
this is a great technique to eliminate

337
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,919
gallon so go in a vegetable farm which

338
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:31,300
is a problem in a lot of vegetable farms

339
00:16:28,919 --> 00:16:36,759
induced by all that cultivation of bare

340
00:16:31,299 --> 00:16:38,889
soil another way just to think about

341
00:16:36,759 --> 00:16:41,350
cover crops is how to phenomenon as

342
00:16:38,889 --> 00:16:44,740
actually turn cover crops into cash a

343
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:48,819
cash crop a variable cash crop so for

344
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:52,989
many years I've utilized field Peas

345
00:16:48,818 --> 00:16:55,568
as a as a summer fallow nurse with oats

346
00:16:52,989 --> 00:16:58,359
just spin it on three two one two three

347
00:16:55,568 --> 00:17:00,938
three parts of fuel peas 2 1 part oats

348
00:16:58,359 --> 00:17:02,979
I've done trials of about 15 varieties

349
00:17:00,938 --> 00:17:05,918
of feel peas and I'm looking for a

350
00:17:02,979 --> 00:17:09,308
tender and juicy and and non powdery

351
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:12,819
mildew susceptible variety of fuel

352
00:17:09,308 --> 00:17:16,778
pianet and and maximum at Johnny's is

353
00:17:12,818 --> 00:17:21,788
one varietal and many varieties that

354
00:17:16,778 --> 00:17:23,980
don't work so well and and after about

355
00:17:21,788 --> 00:17:25,509
four weeks of growth with the fuel peas

356
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:27,849
when they first come out the shoots are

357
00:17:25,509 --> 00:17:30,429
tough so you need to have enough growth

358
00:17:27,849 --> 00:17:32,079
and so that that with your finger you

359
00:17:30,429 --> 00:17:33,370
can snap them when they snap and that

360
00:17:32,079 --> 00:17:35,798
then they're tender and it's a great

361
00:17:33,369 --> 00:17:37,538
stir fried green it's very popular in

362
00:17:35,798 --> 00:17:40,450
Asian cuisine also a kind of new

363
00:17:37,538 --> 00:17:42,099
American chefs I used to sell to 35

364
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:44,440
restaurants and so I was getting nine

365
00:17:42,099 --> 00:17:45,759
ten dollars a pound for the pea shoots

366
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:48,340
for the restaurant trade but it was the

367
00:17:45,759 --> 00:17:50,500
only thing I sold straight wholesale

368
00:17:48,339 --> 00:17:52,359
market terminal Chelsea Market Terminal

369
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:54,940
to a broker the market terminal I was

370
00:17:52,359 --> 00:17:57,638
getting 450 a pound for my broker there

371
00:17:54,940 --> 00:18:00,340
and I was selling you know from 40 to 80

372
00:17:57,638 --> 00:18:02,349
cases a week through the market terminal

373
00:18:00,339 --> 00:18:04,509
and so I would stagger my ceilings of

374
00:18:02,349 --> 00:18:08,740
fuel piece of notes to try to extend my

375
00:18:04,509 --> 00:18:10,990
my supply of the fuel peas and oats for

376
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:12,909
that cash crop value as well as getting

377
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:15,038
all the benefits of having this fallow

378
00:18:12,909 --> 00:18:16,840
field of you know tillage weed

379
00:18:15,038 --> 00:18:18,638
suppression you'd get off that buildup

380
00:18:16,839 --> 00:18:23,798
of organic matter and also the nitrogen

381
00:18:18,638 --> 00:18:25,388
that come off the fuel B's in that as

382
00:18:23,798 --> 00:18:28,148
the maximum Brian or a few other

383
00:18:25,388 --> 00:18:29,709
varieties of field Peas and that you

384
00:18:28,148 --> 00:18:31,058
know that the the flowers at different

385
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:32,500
colors and that I found the chef's

386
00:18:31,058 --> 00:18:35,109
really liked the purple flower you got

387
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:37,240
off the maxima and also just used that

388
00:18:35,109 --> 00:18:38,678
little little point where the flower

389
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:41,138
isn't that and I would add that in my

390
00:18:38,679 --> 00:18:42,850
salad mix it's a great bulking agent for

391
00:18:41,138 --> 00:18:45,308
the salad mix and the pea flower is a

392
00:18:42,849 --> 00:18:49,148
beautiful pea flavor and I was getting a

393
00:18:45,308 --> 00:18:51,190
clam shell 50 count people options for

394
00:18:49,148 --> 00:18:53,888
20 dollars a clam shell and selling many

395
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:56,649
hundreds of pounds I mean how many

396
00:18:53,888 --> 00:18:59,528
hundreds of dollars a value off those of

397
00:18:56,648 --> 00:19:01,449
people awesomes also as a white flower

398
00:18:59,528 --> 00:19:03,299
some varieties that's kind of the that's

399
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:06,700
the length of the pshew

400
00:19:03,299 --> 00:19:09,129
and then if I wanted to extend that

401
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:11,410
season you could use it for just get one

402
00:19:09,130 --> 00:19:13,930
flush and then have cash crops come on

403
00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:16,930
the back side of fuel Pisa and oats or

404
00:19:13,930 --> 00:19:18,759
you could double up and designate a

405
00:19:16,930 --> 00:19:21,220
whole field for a whole season than that

406
00:19:18,759 --> 00:19:25,720
and so a lot of the acreage that's what

407
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:28,180
I would do I would let the oats and the

408
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:31,150
fuel pee mature but it wouldn't have to

409
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:34,480
be combine mature just just start to

410
00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:37,000
have a bit of a seed coat to it and then

411
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:39,970
I would mow it I use the Spader one pass

412
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:42,430
of the Spader which is a less aggressive

413
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:46,180
tillage tool but you know it is it still

414
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:47,890
has a tillage group tool for certain so

415
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:50,049
that's one pass the Spader get that

416
00:19:47,890 --> 00:19:51,850
residue into the ground you need

417
00:19:50,049 --> 00:19:54,359
moisture to sprout it so you need to do

418
00:19:51,849 --> 00:19:59,259
it with rain whoops

419
00:19:54,359 --> 00:20:01,029
or with irrigation and then here's your

420
00:19:59,259 --> 00:20:02,890
second flush later in August and then

421
00:20:01,029 --> 00:20:04,450
you have another another round going

422
00:20:02,890 --> 00:20:07,630
into the fall of your pea shoots and

423
00:20:04,450 --> 00:20:09,220
that as well as all that biomass very

424
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:10,420
dry last two years of Johnny so

425
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:12,970
definitely had to irrigate an in

426
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:18,340
midsummer there it is a Johnny's really

427
00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:22,059
nice flushed back in August and then

428
00:20:18,339 --> 00:20:23,619
then that will winter kill if we have my

429
00:20:22,059 --> 00:20:25,539
you know if you have a mild fall in that

430
00:20:23,619 --> 00:20:27,879
you don't want the oats in that second

431
00:20:25,539 --> 00:20:30,670
flush to set maturity to that so you

432
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:32,350
might mow it down as that oat seed if

433
00:20:30,670 --> 00:20:34,240
it's a little juicy you want to mow it

434
00:20:32,349 --> 00:20:35,379
down before it hardens up and that so

435
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:37,900
you don't have a problem with that as a

436
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:39,910
volunteer or the next spring and then I

437
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:44,530
found that I used a much less aggressive

438
00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:47,019
tillage after the fuel Pina no residue

439
00:20:44,529 --> 00:20:48,339
and that kind of got wet and and soft

440
00:20:47,019 --> 00:20:51,970
and that through the winter net very

441
00:20:48,339 --> 00:20:53,679
easy to work for early spring crops and

442
00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:55,480
that with no additional fertilization

443
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:58,000
other than you know adjusting for pH and

444
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:59,529
at and most of my direct seeded crops my

445
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:05,440
following spring would come off the

446
00:20:59,529 --> 00:21:08,349
field piano fallow Sudan grass just a

447
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:11,830
great builder of organic matter and a

448
00:21:08,349 --> 00:21:13,509
weed suppressant I want to see the thick

449
00:21:11,829 --> 00:21:15,220
I'm broadcasting but you can just see

450
00:21:13,509 --> 00:21:17,170
drill

451
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:18,819
what I found is that I may let the Sudan

452
00:21:17,170 --> 00:21:21,250
grass get the full maturity and add its

453
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:23,200
so stocky and lignin it's hard to break

454
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:25,359
it down through the winter the next year

455
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,799
and that so I would mow it three times

456
00:21:25,359 --> 00:21:30,939
not let it get any higher than waist

457
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:33,309
high and also it would I find that it

458
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:35,710
would the root mass and that would get

459
00:21:33,309 --> 00:21:38,190
thicker from that mowing in that you'd

460
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:41,710
have you know no weeds in that

461
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:44,110
understory of the Sudan grass and then

462
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:45,640
sometimes I wanted to with this this

463
00:21:44,109 --> 00:21:49,539
summer foul and that get a clover

464
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:51,730
established in the backside and so just

465
00:21:49,539 --> 00:21:54,700
before my third mowing I would drop

466
00:21:51,730 --> 00:21:56,559
medium red clover seed into the Sudan

467
00:21:54,700 --> 00:22:00,330
grass and the mowett so that the

468
00:21:56,559 --> 00:22:02,919
resident would be a mulch and then

469
00:22:00,329 --> 00:22:04,960
here's the stuff my first year I get it

470
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:06,519
and that you know part of the field they

471
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:09,160
just did it straight Sudan grass let it

472
00:22:06,519 --> 00:22:11,680
winter kill and the other part of the

473
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:13,150
field I did this technique and now I've

474
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:14,860
used I've used it up in johnny's it

475
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:17,290
works really well on if you have kind of

476
00:22:14,859 --> 00:22:19,689
dry sandy soils on that that mulch and

477
00:22:17,289 --> 00:22:21,220
that is a nice kind of nurse material

478
00:22:19,690 --> 00:22:22,990
for that clover underneath it than that

479
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:24,009
and then you'll have a nice stand of

480
00:22:22,990 --> 00:22:29,259
clover they'll take you into the next

481
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:32,049
next spring buckwheat tom has talked

482
00:22:29,259 --> 00:22:37,150
about that it's just it's a great great

483
00:22:32,049 --> 00:22:39,690
interruption summer cover crop great

484
00:22:37,150 --> 00:22:43,780
smother crop it's also really good for

485
00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:47,019
harboring beneficial insects bees and

486
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:50,589
otherwise and so I would always in in

487
00:22:47,019 --> 00:22:55,420
fields of this case Brussels sprouts but

488
00:22:50,589 --> 00:22:58,119
in Nebraska fields that every xx bed and

489
00:22:55,420 --> 00:23:01,180
that I would put a bed of of buckwheat

490
00:22:58,119 --> 00:23:02,559
stagger those beds and they would be

491
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:04,380
insect II areas and had to bring my

492
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:06,970
beneficial is in I found that there's a

493
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:09,070
predator wasps it likes to crack open

494
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:11,829
the back of imported cabbage worm

495
00:23:09,069 --> 00:23:14,200
Annette and so if you have these little

496
00:23:11,829 --> 00:23:17,529
stands of flowering buckwheat in that

497
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:19,420
it's a great attractant for bringing in

498
00:23:17,529 --> 00:23:21,849
some of these these wasps and that that

499
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:25,179
really can knock out your cabbage worms

500
00:23:21,849 --> 00:23:27,869
and that also they're great great crop

501
00:23:25,179 --> 00:23:27,870
for honeybees

502
00:23:28,019 --> 00:23:33,548
Kim stoner and the Connecticut

503
00:23:31,659 --> 00:23:35,919
Experiment Station that has done a lot

504
00:23:33,548 --> 00:23:37,778
of work on evaluating different cover

505
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:40,120
crops and what beneficial insects they

506
00:23:37,778 --> 00:23:42,250
bring in and this is kind of a hard

507
00:23:40,119 --> 00:23:45,009
slide to read an app but the point of it

508
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:48,388
is is that she was looking at at

509
00:23:45,009 --> 00:23:50,648
honeybees and in bumblebees bumblebees

510
00:23:48,388 --> 00:23:52,298
build their nests in the ground so

511
00:23:50,648 --> 00:23:54,009
ground tillage and that disturbance on

512
00:23:52,298 --> 00:23:56,069
that is going to take that need of be

513
00:23:54,009 --> 00:23:58,000
out of you're off your farm and that

514
00:23:56,069 --> 00:24:00,970
honeybees of course you know they were

515
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:04,058
managing honeybees with Europe be high

516
00:24:00,970 --> 00:24:06,639
and that but not all flowering cover

517
00:24:04,058 --> 00:24:09,519
crops are going to attract the the same

518
00:24:06,638 --> 00:24:12,009
same insect canet so for medium red

519
00:24:09,519 --> 00:24:15,130
clover net it's attractive to bumble

520
00:24:12,009 --> 00:24:18,089
bees but not honeybees and as opposed to

521
00:24:15,130 --> 00:24:21,389
say buckwheat is is attractive to

522
00:24:18,089 --> 00:24:25,178
honeybees but not bumblebees and there

523
00:24:21,388 --> 00:24:26,949
are few of these flowering cover crops

524
00:24:25,179 --> 00:24:28,809
like white clover that attractive to

525
00:24:26,950 --> 00:24:30,580
both honey bees and bumblebees so it's

526
00:24:28,808 --> 00:24:32,470
kind of like know your bees and know

527
00:24:30,579 --> 00:24:35,109
your cover crop and and you can use them

528
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:39,009
to bring in something into your into

529
00:24:35,109 --> 00:24:40,959
your fields and buckwheat is great it's

530
00:24:39,009 --> 00:24:42,849
really easy to knock down I really like

531
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:45,278
buckwheat he's a setup for fall carrots

532
00:24:42,849 --> 00:24:46,959
and at to really clean your soil up for

533
00:24:45,278 --> 00:24:49,898
direct seeded carrots and that it's just

534
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:52,240
a great setup crop for that and and

535
00:24:49,898 --> 00:24:54,009
again I found that if I'm not gonna put

536
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:56,740
a fall crop in the backside of a

537
00:24:54,009 --> 00:24:58,388
buckwheat net just before you move that

538
00:24:56,740 --> 00:25:01,058
flowering buckwheat down if you can drop

539
00:24:58,388 --> 00:25:02,918
medium red clover down then mow it and

540
00:25:01,058 --> 00:25:04,690
then run a coldie Packer over you get a

541
00:25:02,919 --> 00:25:09,490
nice stand of clover take you into the

542
00:25:04,690 --> 00:25:13,120
into the fall equipment and that for

543
00:25:09,490 --> 00:25:14,620
cover crops it's good that you know you

544
00:25:13,119 --> 00:25:18,219
want to match up the width of your

545
00:25:14,619 --> 00:25:19,898
implements to your bed bed widths on

546
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:24,069
that so you can work with these strips

547
00:25:19,898 --> 00:25:26,768
and that it's also important that if

548
00:25:24,069 --> 00:25:28,839
you're going to set aside cropland to

549
00:25:26,769 --> 00:25:30,880
cover crops and that you know it they're

550
00:25:28,839 --> 00:25:32,980
not you know run by automatic pilot you

551
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:35,049
need to manage them irrigation is very

552
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:37,240
important to be able to kind of mitigate

553
00:25:35,048 --> 00:25:41,759
drought stress on cover crops and so you

554
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:43,720
want to think about that and

555
00:25:41,759 --> 00:25:45,700
you know and so that there's a

556
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:48,339
commitment to getting these cover crops

557
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:50,170
in not as an afterthought so all my

558
00:25:48,339 --> 00:25:52,119
equipment will kind of match up for my

559
00:25:50,170 --> 00:25:55,440
purposes of using cover crops and that

560
00:25:52,119 --> 00:25:57,669
and the bed width of my tractors I mean

561
00:25:55,440 --> 00:26:00,490
an implement that we brought in to

562
00:25:57,670 --> 00:26:02,680
johnny's that was discovery for me it's

563
00:26:00,490 --> 00:26:04,870
very stony soil for a lot of fields we

564
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:06,580
had there so I guess Bader would not

565
00:26:04,869 --> 00:26:08,139
work well therefore cutting strips and

566
00:26:06,579 --> 00:26:09,879
so this is kind of like a hybrid

567
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:12,040
perfecter than that but instead of

568
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:14,260
having those s tine sweeps and that it

569
00:26:12,039 --> 00:26:17,230
has two gangs of disks then you have the

570
00:26:14,259 --> 00:26:19,359
rakes and the roller bar in the back but

571
00:26:17,230 --> 00:26:22,329
it's great for cutting strips if you get

572
00:26:19,359 --> 00:26:28,359
in there early and makes a nice level

573
00:26:22,329 --> 00:26:32,589
seed bed and also it's a nice nice bed

574
00:26:28,359 --> 00:26:35,069
to also be laying plastic on all kinds

575
00:26:32,589 --> 00:26:38,470
of implements for seeding and that from

576
00:26:35,069 --> 00:26:41,379
fertilizers spreaders to see drills we

577
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:44,289
do a lot of Racine just by by hand

578
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:45,880
Cedars nothing wrong with that it's a

579
00:26:44,289 --> 00:26:48,670
nice feel that was seated with the see

580
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:50,680
drill but when I'm using the see drill

581
00:26:48,670 --> 00:26:52,210
and spinning home you know almost every

582
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:54,610
time I'm putting cover crops on because

583
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:56,440
I really want to get a good catch in

584
00:26:54,609 --> 00:26:58,209
that I'll put a coldie packer on the

585
00:26:56,440 --> 00:27:00,279
backside I think that called a packer in

586
00:26:58,210 --> 00:27:02,319
the backside just a good guarantee that

587
00:27:00,279 --> 00:27:04,599
you get good seed to soil contact and

588
00:27:02,319 --> 00:27:06,490
and you want to seed with moisture

589
00:27:04,599 --> 00:27:08,169
either either moisture is coming are

590
00:27:06,490 --> 00:27:10,089
there's good moisture in the field to

591
00:27:08,170 --> 00:27:12,670
get a good stand you do not want to seed

592
00:27:10,089 --> 00:27:14,980
in kind of desert dry conditions that's

593
00:27:12,670 --> 00:27:17,070
a recipe for disaster with with cover

594
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:17,069
crops

595
00:27:18,079 --> 00:27:23,599
and just pictures of Kovac you can buy

596
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:25,789
coldly Packers without without seed seed

597
00:27:23,599 --> 00:27:28,129
hoppers and that I'll just kind of skip

598
00:27:25,789 --> 00:27:30,259
quickly and just to end a net burn

599
00:27:28,130 --> 00:27:31,970
talked about this but there uh you know

600
00:27:30,259 --> 00:27:33,859
I've been thinking recently there's a

601
00:27:31,970 --> 00:27:35,960
lot of high tunnels that Johnny's and

602
00:27:33,859 --> 00:27:37,579
that looking for ideal candidates a high

603
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:39,860
tunnel environment so I'm looking for

604
00:27:37,579 --> 00:27:41,029
something that might be a legume might

605
00:27:39,859 --> 00:27:44,029
have something to do with with bio

606
00:27:41,029 --> 00:27:46,069
fumigation easy to manage easy with hand

607
00:27:44,029 --> 00:27:49,129
tillage a knock down so fenugreek is one

608
00:27:46,069 --> 00:27:51,139
it's a thirty five day leg you it's also

609
00:27:49,130 --> 00:27:57,110
a high valley cash crop for East Indian

610
00:27:51,140 --> 00:28:01,009
community whoops that's what it looks

611
00:27:57,109 --> 00:28:03,049
like here it is in a high tunnel and

612
00:28:01,009 --> 00:28:06,950
other ones by OPM to get mustards than

613
00:28:03,049 --> 00:28:10,789
that and easy to manage very thick and

614
00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:19,009
cut and come again and with that well

615
00:28:10,789 --> 00:28:20,779
will stop as I'm over time here this has

616
00:28:19,009 --> 00:28:26,349
been a production of Cornell University

617
00:28:20,779 --> 00:28:26,349
on the web at Cornell edu
