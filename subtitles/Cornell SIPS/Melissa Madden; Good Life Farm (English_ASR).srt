1
00:00:00,549 --> 00:00:05,310
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,678 --> 00:00:05,309
University

3
00:00:07,219 --> 00:00:12,330
hi so you guys are all about to go into

4
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:15,629
finals but right

5
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:16,349
I was kind of impressed that you're here

6
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:19,710
thank you

7
00:00:16,349 --> 00:00:21,719
and I got a total load of crap dumped on

8
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:23,849
me when I left the farm today we're all

9
00:00:21,719 --> 00:00:25,229
planting trees so we can all just be

10
00:00:23,849 --> 00:00:29,699
glad that we're in this little cocoon

11
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:31,469
together for an hour how many of you

12
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:34,950
have heard of the Finger Lakes cider

13
00:00:31,469 --> 00:00:36,420
house or let me start with how many have

14
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:37,829
you been to the Finger Lakes cider house

15
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:41,210
okay cool

16
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:44,969
how many have heard of Goodlife farm

17
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:48,710
haha that is a UH tur failure let me

18
00:00:44,969 --> 00:00:51,329
just say of the loves of cider house on

19
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:54,689
so I'm going to start with that at that

20
00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:57,299
point um I guess I'll tell you a little

21
00:00:54,689 --> 00:01:00,209
bit of myself first um so my name is

22
00:00:57,299 --> 00:01:05,459
Melissa med I graduated from Cornell in

23
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:07,200
2004 and I was the whatever you guys are

24
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:11,609
calling that position now the organic

25
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:14,728
farm coordinator at Cornell from 2008 to

26
00:01:11,609 --> 00:01:17,069
2011 okay Betsy yeah

27
00:01:14,728 --> 00:01:20,609
and during that time my husband and I

28
00:01:17,069 --> 00:01:23,908
bought our farm we had spent a number of

29
00:01:20,609 --> 00:01:27,120
years apprentice inform and just kind of

30
00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:28,950
in 2007 something kind of like so that

31
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:31,170
doesn't actually sound that long from

32
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:33,270
2004 to 2007 we're like we're done

33
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:34,859
working for other people we can't

34
00:01:33,269 --> 00:01:38,629
possibly do this another minute longer

35
00:01:34,859 --> 00:01:41,909
and we're both really lucky to get a

36
00:01:38,629 --> 00:01:43,649
really good job that were not like

37
00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:46,080
apprenticeships in agriculture anymore

38
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:48,810
my husband was originally very well

39
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:50,670
trained carpenter and he became the

40
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:52,769
production manager at slug planet which

41
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:55,680
she heard of is like a great revolution

42
00:01:52,769 --> 00:01:59,399
in energy efficiency for housing in

43
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:01,260
Tompkins County um and I got the jobs at

44
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:02,640
Bettina house and that was really

45
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:06,659
pivotal for us because we were

46
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:09,030
immediately able to get loans and buy a

47
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:13,110
piece of land so we spent a lot of time

48
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:16,528
looking for farm a farm a lot of time is

49
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:19,200
like super relative like I was 24 and he

50
00:02:16,528 --> 00:02:19,900
are 25 and he was 21 and so like every

51
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:24,158
month that went

52
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:27,849
I felt like greater emergency so we came

53
00:02:24,158 --> 00:02:30,219
back from an apprenticeship in December

54
00:02:27,848 --> 00:02:32,828
of 2007 applied for these jobs like

55
00:02:30,219 --> 00:02:36,699
somehow miraculously got them by January

56
00:02:32,829 --> 00:02:38,620
of 2008 and then by March of 2008 we had

57
00:02:36,699 --> 00:02:40,780
an offer and a piece of property and we

58
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:43,629
were like that don't so long oh my god

59
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:45,370
like what were we like oh this is just

60
00:02:43,628 --> 00:02:49,810
agonizing we need to start farming right

61
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:52,150
now and then the funny thing was this is

62
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:54,759
the land we bought so there was this is

63
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:57,158
not on our property so there was no

64
00:02:54,759 --> 00:02:59,378
there was no infrastructure at all and

65
00:02:57,158 --> 00:03:01,060
it was it took till June to close who

66
00:02:59,378 --> 00:03:05,169
put an offer in and Marchant took till

67
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:06,938
June to close and we put a little yurt

68
00:03:05,169 --> 00:03:08,589
here those of you who have been there

69
00:03:06,938 --> 00:03:10,150
maybe have heard of it or seen it but

70
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:11,799
it's kind of across this little creeks

71
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:14,230
we had to build it we felled some trees

72
00:03:11,799 --> 00:03:16,299
and built a bridge and then we by the

73
00:03:14,229 --> 00:03:19,268
time we closed like this entire farm was

74
00:03:16,299 --> 00:03:21,670
planted to conventional wheat and

75
00:03:19,269 --> 00:03:23,889
soybeans so that was it for us for the

76
00:03:21,669 --> 00:03:25,539
year of having any control over our

77
00:03:23,889 --> 00:03:27,400
property which was like a really

78
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:32,828
interesting and difficult experience

79
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:35,739
because we were coming coming at it with

80
00:03:32,829 --> 00:03:38,260
these extreme I would say views about

81
00:03:35,739 --> 00:03:39,639
the way we wanted to manage land and the

82
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:42,128
changes that we wanted to see and the

83
00:03:39,639 --> 00:03:44,349
reason I'm kind of making so much fun of

84
00:03:42,128 --> 00:03:46,628
our sense of time is that it's been over

85
00:03:44,348 --> 00:03:49,089
the past ten years like expanded and

86
00:03:46,628 --> 00:03:51,638
expanded because we wanted to have a

87
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:54,128
permaculture paradise so more hands who

88
00:03:51,639 --> 00:03:56,340
knows what permaculture means does

89
00:03:54,128 --> 00:03:58,509
anyone care to offer a definition I

90
00:03:56,340 --> 00:04:00,430
certainly am NOT an expert and I kind of

91
00:03:58,509 --> 00:04:03,219
started forgetting what I usually say

92
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:07,879
about it so does anyone else one throw

93
00:04:03,219 --> 00:04:10,188
something out there agriculture that is

94
00:04:07,878 --> 00:04:12,858
based on attorney electron based

95
00:04:10,188 --> 00:04:16,939
agriculture so the crops that you grow

96
00:04:12,859 --> 00:04:21,079
there so backwards are there like trees

97
00:04:16,939 --> 00:04:23,269
or yeah I love writing so I'm going to

98
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:27,110
so actually there's like two things

99
00:04:23,269 --> 00:04:28,788
going on there there's the concept and

100
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:30,949
then there's the tools right and what

101
00:04:28,788 --> 00:04:35,089
you just said I would personally say as

102
00:04:30,949 --> 00:04:36,770
a tool which is perennial agriculture do

103
00:04:35,089 --> 00:04:41,209
you know what the concept is that it

104
00:04:36,769 --> 00:04:42,680
goes with that well that's that's the

105
00:04:41,209 --> 00:04:45,348
most common interpretation of

106
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:47,120
permaculture anyone else want to take a

107
00:04:45,348 --> 00:04:50,149
stab at it I'm not like I hope you don't

108
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:52,038
feel like I just shot you down I made a

109
00:04:50,149 --> 00:04:53,899
mistake once when I first met my husband

110
00:04:52,038 --> 00:04:56,029
I was giving a talk on soil science and

111
00:04:53,899 --> 00:04:57,469
we were brainstorming and he said

112
00:04:56,029 --> 00:05:00,619
something that I thought was wrong and I

113
00:04:57,470 --> 00:05:03,310
said no it is an extract of the entire

114
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:07,610
room and I can't believe we got married

115
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:10,788
but anyway so I won't do that promise

116
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:14,800
does anyone want to take stab just these

117
00:05:10,788 --> 00:05:14,800
are really important for me so yeah

118
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:23,930
design approach for what was sustainable

119
00:05:24,709 --> 00:05:31,680
yeah thank you

120
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:34,439
that's the big overarching one right I'm

121
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,459
just going to say life and then there's

122
00:05:34,439 --> 00:05:40,290
three kind of like

123
00:05:35,459 --> 00:05:41,549
little things that we like to say does

124
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:44,939
anyone know what they are they're very

125
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:49,590
codified in the permaculture looks kind

126
00:05:44,939 --> 00:05:51,329
so earth care this is I had a very

127
00:05:49,589 --> 00:05:58,049
embarrassing moment where I forgot one

128
00:05:51,329 --> 00:06:04,169
of them fair share and people care does

129
00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:08,280
anyone disagree with me did you ever

130
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:10,080
kind of okay so I think this is where

131
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:12,449
like a lot of permaculture lists end up

132
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:16,319
is that this is a this is a really

133
00:06:12,449 --> 00:06:18,019
direct line in terms of tools and one

134
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:20,279
thing I'm excited to talk about is how

135
00:06:18,019 --> 00:06:21,539
once your business gets more mature you

136
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:23,099
actually maybe start to feel like you

137
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:25,140
can address these things these other two

138
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:27,120
things but this is definitely where we

139
00:06:25,139 --> 00:06:29,250
started so if you can imagine we're

140
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:31,590
sitting we were like camping basically

141
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:34,949
living in a yurt which we still live in

142
00:06:31,589 --> 00:06:36,479
ten years later which is a problem under

143
00:06:34,949 --> 00:06:42,199
this which is like you should have a

144
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:44,520
house after 10 years so we were watching

145
00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:46,379
this farming system that we like very

146
00:06:44,519 --> 00:06:48,389
vehement Lee just agreed with right like

147
00:06:46,379 --> 00:06:51,870
I had has anyone heard of Cayuga pure

148
00:06:48,389 --> 00:06:54,709
organics not yeah these things pass and

149
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:58,110
then we find out how old we are all

150
00:06:54,709 --> 00:07:01,079
because no it was like hot you

151
00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:02,490
could send here to call this so how you

152
00:07:01,079 --> 00:07:04,379
get pure organics is where I met my

153
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:06,120
husband and it was a green farm that was

154
00:07:04,379 --> 00:07:08,639
making really big waves in brook Tyndale

155
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:10,259
because they were vertically integrating

156
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:13,349
in the way that older grain farms used

157
00:07:10,259 --> 00:07:16,500
to processing their own grain instead of

158
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:18,870
selling it to a much larger mill and it

159
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:20,730
was in green star and everyone was

160
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:22,379
trying to like figure out how to work

161
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:24,509
with it and I was one of the original

162
00:07:22,379 --> 00:07:26,040
cleaners of beans there and you know

163
00:07:24,509 --> 00:07:27,469
like Reva taquería would get these

164
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:29,600
incredible bags being

165
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:31,130
and then have to spend a lot of time

166
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:32,990
pulling the rocks out because we were

167
00:07:31,129 --> 00:07:36,050
not that great at what we were doing

168
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:38,150
originally and so that was that was one

169
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:39,170
of those things that in farming that way

170
00:07:38,149 --> 00:07:42,109
no that was a certified organic

171
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:44,660
operation anytime there was a rain event

172
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:46,520
like you can imagine for most of the

173
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:48,860
year that's like a ton of exposed soil

174
00:07:46,519 --> 00:07:50,810
and it can be a really distressing thing

175
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:55,819
to be part of and witness and perpetuate

176
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:57,530
so I remember in 2000 so this is for a

177
00:07:55,819 --> 00:07:59,930
full year we weren't able to get like

178
00:07:57,529 --> 00:08:02,419
permanent ground cover on our property

179
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:04,879
and I'm not saying like I eat perennial

180
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:07,100
or I eat annual vegetables I eat annual

181
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:08,779
grains I'm not saying no I'm saying

182
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:10,310
that's not how we wanted a farm we

183
00:08:08,779 --> 00:08:10,909
wanted to push the boundaries as much as

184
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:14,389
possible

185
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:15,920
of this because we were seeing that most

186
00:08:14,389 --> 00:08:17,870
of the people practicing this we're

187
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:19,670
practicing it on a hobby scale under

188
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:22,459
definitely under five acres and mostly

189
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:24,050
under one acre and so we wanted to know

190
00:08:22,459 --> 00:08:25,549
if it's like an actual farming system

191
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:29,509
that could be a pride apply to a broad

192
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:32,659
scale so this is a 69 acre parcel 45

193
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:34,788
acres of open fields and 24 acres of

194
00:08:32,659 --> 00:08:37,579
woods and we felt like this is like this

195
00:08:34,788 --> 00:08:40,218
great blank slate this from here to here

196
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:43,250
is Honeoye soil does anybody know very

197
00:08:40,219 --> 00:08:44,960
much about that soil type it's the state

198
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:46,909
soil oh my God thank you for knowing

199
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:48,920
that it's delicious right like it's

200
00:08:46,909 --> 00:08:51,620
actually a sweet soil a little bit

201
00:08:48,919 --> 00:08:54,889
alkaline it's very deep and very lonely

202
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:57,230
lomi and incredibly rich and then from

203
00:08:54,889 --> 00:09:00,949
here down as Cazenovia so to anyone know

204
00:08:57,230 --> 00:09:02,750
anything about Cazenovia it was still a

205
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:05,750
really good Ag soil it doesn't really

206
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:07,580
nothing compares to honey way but um so

207
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:09,559
our two flagship sliders are now named

208
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:11,389
to those two things and in terms of the

209
00:09:09,559 --> 00:09:12,588
failure of the tasting room to tell you

210
00:09:11,389 --> 00:09:14,710
those things that you don't know about

211
00:09:12,589 --> 00:09:17,810
our farm you don't know that that stuff

212
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:20,180
so we were we were thinking okay with

213
00:09:17,809 --> 00:09:23,119
this great farm it's a really good base

214
00:09:20,179 --> 00:09:26,059
we're going to show what 69 acres can do

215
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:28,009
in terms of perennial agriculture but

216
00:09:26,059 --> 00:09:33,439
then we had to wait a year just to plant

217
00:09:28,009 --> 00:09:36,230
the ground cover so in March of 20 2009

218
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:37,410
on there was a huge rain event and I

219
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:39,659
remember just standing out

220
00:09:37,409 --> 00:09:41,939
so all the crafts have been harvested

221
00:09:39,659 --> 00:09:43,409
there's very little residue and there

222
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:44,940
are no roots no living roots in the

223
00:09:43,409 --> 00:09:47,789
ground and very you know like very few

224
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:50,459
even your like previous care roots and

225
00:09:47,789 --> 00:09:54,000
this is like an 8% slope would you agree

226
00:09:50,458 --> 00:09:56,429
Tom from here to here slippin down

227
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,509
towards how you like and you can do see

228
00:09:56,429 --> 00:10:04,409
these does anyone know what these are

229
00:09:59,509 --> 00:10:07,230
not Tom what yeah these are like the

230
00:10:04,409 --> 00:10:09,000
dips in the farm yeah and this is where

231
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:10,470
can you see how they're even in this

232
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
time of year which you can see this is

233
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:16,620
like really early spring have dark green

234
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:18,720
layer like it's amazing what how much

235
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:20,818
less soil is on the top of these ridges

236
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:23,639
here than in these valleys here so we

237
00:10:20,818 --> 00:10:27,378
our big goal was to stop that right away

238
00:10:23,639 --> 00:10:31,019
and I remember in March of 2009 just

239
00:10:27,379 --> 00:10:33,420
like totally freaking out like standing

240
00:10:31,019 --> 00:10:35,578
here and watching all this topsoil go

241
00:10:33,419 --> 00:10:38,818
this way I mean like what do I do like I

242
00:10:35,578 --> 00:10:40,828
want to lie down and like put some straw

243
00:10:38,818 --> 00:10:43,259
down like I'm a tiny little person and

244
00:10:40,828 --> 00:10:45,359
this is 16 acres or 69 acres and like

245
00:10:43,259 --> 00:10:48,000
there was nothing I could do and then

246
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:51,089
luckily by May we had gotten the whole

247
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,490
thing planted to grass and I ran into my

248
00:10:51,089 --> 00:10:55,620
friend who is a grain farmer who has

249
00:10:53,490 --> 00:11:01,589
spoken here and I will not say his name

250
00:10:55,620 --> 00:11:03,149
and he was so so annoyed because it was

251
00:11:01,589 --> 00:11:05,339
like I really wish you would have rented

252
00:11:03,149 --> 00:11:06,688
your farm to me why you figured your

253
00:11:05,339 --> 00:11:07,860
out and I was like well it's

254
00:11:06,688 --> 00:11:10,289
already figured out that I know what I'm

255
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:13,318
doing and this is what I'm doing and we

256
00:11:10,289 --> 00:11:15,539
have saved the planet so it was a very

257
00:11:13,318 --> 00:11:19,889
successful moment to plant grass and

258
00:11:15,539 --> 00:11:23,338
then quickly in succession let's see I

259
00:11:19,889 --> 00:11:28,379
hope I made good so this is what it

260
00:11:23,339 --> 00:11:30,300
looks like in in April of 2009 and then

261
00:11:28,379 --> 00:11:32,039
so you remember this this is what it

262
00:11:30,299 --> 00:11:34,558
basically looks like now I'm not like a

263
00:11:32,039 --> 00:11:37,708
very excellent graphic designer this is

264
00:11:34,558 --> 00:11:39,838
a PowerPoint mock-up and yeah I see that

265
00:11:37,708 --> 00:11:41,458
it says 2013 on the top but I guess what

266
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:43,829
I'll say is we continue to plant trees

267
00:11:41,458 --> 00:11:45,750
all the way down and the entire farm is

268
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:47,609
green and I just learned that there's

269
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:49,139
actually a new google shot so I probably

270
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:50,830
should have put that in there but

271
00:11:49,139 --> 00:11:53,710
basically what you can see is

272
00:11:50,830 --> 00:11:55,540
it the only part of our farm at this

273
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:57,040
point that remains in annual tillage

274
00:11:55,539 --> 00:12:00,059
agriculture is right here

275
00:11:57,039 --> 00:12:02,529
it's a flattest spot on the farm it's

276
00:12:00,059 --> 00:12:04,809
six high tunnels five of which are

277
00:12:02,529 --> 00:12:08,110
movable asleep all five of those have

278
00:12:04,809 --> 00:12:10,199
three rotations each and otherwise

279
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:13,029
everything's covered in grass and

280
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:16,690
asparagus and we've been planting fruit

281
00:12:13,029 --> 00:12:20,949
trees since 2009 2010 we plant asparagus

282
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:23,770
in 2009 and that was this project that

283
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:26,200
was like crazy like I felt like it was

284
00:12:23,769 --> 00:12:30,129
in a desert right like like nothing

285
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:33,460
happening and now this is 2010 planting

286
00:12:30,129 --> 00:12:35,649
trees and that's a team work looks like

287
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:36,900
I just want to show you this is this is

288
00:12:35,649 --> 00:12:40,120
part of what it looks like now or

289
00:12:36,899 --> 00:12:42,429
actually that's 2011 so those trees are

290
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:44,649
much bigger so it's green is covered in

291
00:12:42,429 --> 00:12:46,209
trees it's it's got like some places

292
00:12:44,649 --> 00:12:49,929
where there's a little bit of tillage

293
00:12:46,210 --> 00:12:52,060
and that's done with horses um and at

294
00:12:49,929 --> 00:12:53,559
the same time like do you think that

295
00:12:52,059 --> 00:12:55,809
we've been able to I'm just looking for

296
00:12:53,559 --> 00:12:59,739
some more pictures I've been able to

297
00:12:55,809 --> 00:13:02,019
make a living off of this farm I see a

298
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:04,299
head shaking some of you who have

299
00:13:02,019 --> 00:13:06,189
already heard this from me I think my

300
00:13:04,299 --> 00:13:10,240
doom and gloom story I've been warned

301
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:12,310
not to be like too negative so one of

302
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:15,639
the problems I think you run into when

303
00:13:12,309 --> 00:13:17,319
you have really big ideas and you you

304
00:13:15,639 --> 00:13:19,600
think that you in in and of yourself

305
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:25,410
like our grand solution is that

306
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:28,659
sometimes you can really fail here and

307
00:13:25,409 --> 00:13:30,490
the one thing about this farm I love my

308
00:13:28,659 --> 00:13:34,659
farm so much I at this point we raise

309
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:36,669
beef cows we raise we have organic

310
00:13:34,659 --> 00:13:38,829
asparagus organic peaches organic apples

311
00:13:36,669 --> 00:13:40,389
organic Asian pears specialty greens

312
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:42,220
which showed you a picture of specialty

313
00:13:40,389 --> 00:13:46,809
ginger which we make into a house-made

314
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:48,700
soda and then poultry sometimes and I

315
00:13:46,809 --> 00:13:51,369
like love the place that the good life

316
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:53,200
farm is but the reality is that it'll be

317
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:56,200
like a whole other generation before

318
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:58,600
that farm is capitalized and that I find

319
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:59,890
challenging like more challenging every

320
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:01,690
year so like one of the things I

321
00:13:59,889 --> 00:14:03,220
mentioned is like still living and

322
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:05,970
basically shack

323
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:10,629
and I think what a lot of people find

324
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:12,279
hilarious about that is that this I'll

325
00:14:10,629 --> 00:14:12,610
come back to these I didn't know what

326
00:14:12,279 --> 00:14:14,529
work

327
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:17,590
I forgot what we're gonna do this is our

328
00:14:14,529 --> 00:14:19,419
building right and we built that

329
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:21,370
ourselves so we're like infinitely

330
00:14:19,419 --> 00:14:23,889
capable of actually building a home and

331
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:25,720
I think one of the things that we have

332
00:14:23,889 --> 00:14:29,590
constantly struggled against is in that

333
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:34,240
idea that we want to make the biggest

334
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:36,490
possible positive impact we realized

335
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:38,889
that we weren't able to be full-time on

336
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:42,669
our own operation with everything being

337
00:14:38,889 --> 00:14:44,230
based in corneal agriculture and in some

338
00:14:42,669 --> 00:14:46,089
ways like I would say cows our perennial

339
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:48,190
agriculture like we raise a cow-calf

340
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:50,080
herd so we're always working off of our

341
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:51,940
own mothers only so every year I have

342
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:54,030
one new mother to add to my herd and

343
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:57,520
that means one additional cow but

344
00:14:54,029 --> 00:15:00,819
ideally like an operation that would

345
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:03,009
good cash flow sorry would be like 100

346
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:05,410
cows anyone want to take a guess at how

347
00:15:03,009 --> 00:15:12,340
many I have in my painful years of

348
00:15:05,409 --> 00:15:14,850
building my heart 18 come on yeah so

349
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:17,590
it's going to be like forever right so

350
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:20,560
we decided that we needed to vertically

351
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:22,930
integrate I did anyone here come to the

352
00:15:20,559 --> 00:15:25,959
farmer ground and a Schnurr farm stock

353
00:15:22,929 --> 00:15:27,309
or have heard from them before so those

354
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:28,840
guys are two of my best friends and

355
00:15:27,309 --> 00:15:30,969
there are really important mentors in my

356
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:33,850
life and I think one of the things they

357
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:35,710
do for me really well is makes fun of me

358
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:38,950
like all the time

359
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:40,660
and they thought this was crazy but they

360
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:43,990
also got it but one of the things about

361
00:15:40,659 --> 00:15:45,730
their vertical integration - did Greg

362
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:46,690
come with them did farmer ground flour

363
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:50,320
no okay

364
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:52,210
so there's Oscar farm very well run like

365
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:53,950
one of the best run organic grain farms

366
00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:58,660
you're ever going to find incredible

367
00:15:53,950 --> 00:16:01,120
crop rotation plan supporting the

368
00:15:58,659 --> 00:16:03,250
beginning of former ground flour which

369
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:05,589
is a really high quality grain mill that

370
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:07,179
sources is designed to source locally

371
00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:09,550
especially for master farms and then

372
00:16:07,179 --> 00:16:10,929
wide awake bakery right

373
00:16:09,549 --> 00:16:12,459
the difference is those are three

374
00:16:10,929 --> 00:16:15,309
separate businesses run by three

375
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:17,379
separate owners one of the things that

376
00:16:15,309 --> 00:16:19,328
we did was we try to verge

377
00:16:17,379 --> 00:16:21,609
we integrate within our own operation so

378
00:16:19,328 --> 00:16:23,798
at this point we've got good life farm

379
00:16:21,609 --> 00:16:26,079
and it is really important that that's

380
00:16:23,798 --> 00:16:28,178
the foundation every year we are able to

381
00:16:26,078 --> 00:16:29,558
make a little bit more of our cider from

382
00:16:28,178 --> 00:16:32,188
our own production but right now we're

383
00:16:29,558 --> 00:16:35,198
only at 20 percent in a good year and

384
00:16:32,188 --> 00:16:36,639
then we have a farm cidery which I

385
00:16:35,198 --> 00:16:38,438
should have a farm winery license and

386
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:39,609
that is great because it means we can

387
00:16:38,438 --> 00:16:41,168
take these apples that we're growing

388
00:16:39,609 --> 00:16:44,139
organically and they look super gnarly

389
00:16:41,168 --> 00:16:46,178
and also the variety is weird

390
00:16:44,139 --> 00:16:47,379
like who here well you guys are really

391
00:16:46,178 --> 00:16:49,448
unique crowd but you know like

392
00:16:47,379 --> 00:16:51,788
Garlington mill Ellis better like dab

393
00:16:49,448 --> 00:16:53,469
Manette our these are not terribly well

394
00:16:51,788 --> 00:16:58,629
known varieties but they're great to

395
00:16:53,470 --> 00:17:00,428
grow in an organic system and we again

396
00:16:58,629 --> 00:17:01,839
like going back to like not only the

397
00:17:00,428 --> 00:17:03,158
fact that it's perennial but how do you

398
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:04,538
want to manage your perennial

399
00:17:03,158 --> 00:17:06,818
agriculture like what do you want your

400
00:17:04,538 --> 00:17:07,808
rotation of inputs to be what do you

401
00:17:06,818 --> 00:17:11,230
want the things that you have to

402
00:17:07,808 --> 00:17:13,418
purchase to be I think that people tend

403
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:16,750
to assume that permaculture farms are

404
00:17:13,419 --> 00:17:18,309
organic and that seems like a natural

405
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:19,990
assumption to me I still personally

406
00:17:18,308 --> 00:17:22,178
think it's very important to be

407
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:23,318
certified if you're practicing organic

408
00:17:22,179 --> 00:17:25,990
agriculture it's not something we should

409
00:17:23,318 --> 00:17:28,658
be self certifying in my opinion because

410
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:31,298
it's really hard to do and takes a lot

411
00:17:28,659 --> 00:17:35,019
of attention a lot of times people will

412
00:17:31,298 --> 00:17:37,898
mix biodynamic swith with permaculture

413
00:17:35,019 --> 00:17:39,878
and I think that's also a great mix as

414
00:17:37,898 --> 00:17:41,319
you can see we it's sort of silly at

415
00:17:39,878 --> 00:17:43,058
this point that we haven't certified

416
00:17:41,319 --> 00:17:45,579
biodynamic because of the integration of

417
00:17:43,058 --> 00:17:48,369
animals on our farm but we don't do the

418
00:17:45,579 --> 00:17:51,250
preparation so we don't we don't do the

419
00:17:48,369 --> 00:17:53,168
full thing and so we've got this farm

420
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:56,378
winery and it's justified by the

421
00:17:53,169 --> 00:17:58,210
existence of our farm our farm but in

422
00:17:56,378 --> 00:18:00,428
reality in New York State you could be a

423
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:03,548
farm winery or farm brewery without

424
00:18:00,429 --> 00:18:05,528
producing a single piece of the

425
00:18:03,548 --> 00:18:07,269
commodity yourself and apples are still

426
00:18:05,528 --> 00:18:10,480
considered a commodity which in and of

427
00:18:07,269 --> 00:18:12,548
itself is an incredibly difficult part

428
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:16,509
of the equation so you all are familiar

429
00:18:12,548 --> 00:18:19,628
maybe with the Lake Ontario sort of

430
00:18:16,509 --> 00:18:21,519
apple belt right that's like it's pretty

431
00:18:19,628 --> 00:18:24,369
cool up there anyone driven along and

432
00:18:21,519 --> 00:18:28,538
like miles and miles and miles of apple

433
00:18:24,369 --> 00:18:30,028
orchards those guys for years this is

434
00:18:28,538 --> 00:18:31,950
slowly changing because

435
00:18:30,028 --> 00:18:35,788
the hard cider revolution but like who

436
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:38,778
do you think they were selling to mots

437
00:18:35,788 --> 00:18:45,479
at what price

438
00:18:38,778 --> 00:18:47,460
like 85 cents maybe 30 cents a pound so

439
00:18:45,479 --> 00:18:51,869
for us to like even start to turn around

440
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:53,129
we need to charge $2 pads it gets a

441
00:18:51,868 --> 00:18:54,569
little better when we just use it

442
00:18:53,128 --> 00:18:57,058
in-house and then it gets a lot better

443
00:18:54,569 --> 00:18:59,428
when we turn it into alcohol and put it

444
00:18:57,058 --> 00:19:03,538
in a bottle which is not very earth

445
00:18:59,429 --> 00:19:06,028
friendly at all and sell it and that is

446
00:19:03,538 --> 00:19:08,489
the beautiful thing the problem is that

447
00:19:06,028 --> 00:19:11,819
most cider e's are making their apples

448
00:19:08,489 --> 00:19:13,739
out of the previous construct that I

449
00:19:11,819 --> 00:19:15,298
just mentioned which is like extremely

450
00:19:13,739 --> 00:19:18,298
cheap fruit and not very high-quality

451
00:19:15,298 --> 00:19:20,940
fruit so there's like this messaging

452
00:19:18,298 --> 00:19:23,848
going on about cider being awesome and

453
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:25,859
farm related and of course like cider is

454
00:19:23,848 --> 00:19:29,608
farm related it's at some point comes

455
00:19:25,858 --> 00:19:30,898
from an apple maybe except for the ones

456
00:19:29,608 --> 00:19:32,999
that didn't write they're made from

457
00:19:30,898 --> 00:19:34,558
malic acid and all this kind of weird

458
00:19:32,999 --> 00:19:36,058
stuff and you can read that right on the

459
00:19:34,558 --> 00:19:39,178
ingredients on the bottle so don't need

460
00:19:36,058 --> 00:19:42,210
to like mention any names but there's a

461
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:43,409
lot of cider ease making cider with

462
00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:46,588
really cheap fruit and dressing it up

463
00:19:43,409 --> 00:19:48,269
really well and that is if you come into

464
00:19:46,588 --> 00:19:50,009
the finger-like cider house like I hope

465
00:19:48,269 --> 00:19:51,538
that you're going to get some glimpse of

466
00:19:50,009 --> 00:19:55,348
what we're trying to do which is stand

467
00:19:51,538 --> 00:19:57,989
for the farms whatever there's a variety

468
00:19:55,348 --> 00:19:59,608
of stages so I'm just going to like kind

469
00:19:57,989 --> 00:20:01,619
of puddle back and say what is the

470
00:19:59,608 --> 00:20:03,808
finger-like cider house specifically

471
00:20:01,618 --> 00:20:06,269
it's the tasting room that you must have

472
00:20:03,808 --> 00:20:08,759
sent most of you have been into and it's

473
00:20:06,269 --> 00:20:10,558
a tasting room for good life cider which

474
00:20:08,759 --> 00:20:11,548
is from Grilli farm which is not an

475
00:20:10,558 --> 00:20:13,019
estate cidery

476
00:20:11,548 --> 00:20:14,759
right we are not a hundred percent

477
00:20:13,019 --> 00:20:16,649
around fruit but it's very important to

478
00:20:14,759 --> 00:20:18,538
us to be working towards that which is

479
00:20:16,648 --> 00:20:20,428
why my crew is at home planting nine

480
00:20:18,538 --> 00:20:24,408
hundred more trees right now and they're

481
00:20:20,429 --> 00:20:27,450
like you are leaving what are you doing

482
00:20:24,409 --> 00:20:29,429
and there's three other cider ease in

483
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:31,919
there Redbird orchard it has anyone

484
00:20:29,429 --> 00:20:34,259
heard of them Eric is the Cornell

485
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:36,479
orchards manager here at Cornell and he

486
00:20:34,259 --> 00:20:39,559
owns Redbird orchard cider they're the

487
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:42,049
smallest black diamonds

488
00:20:39,559 --> 00:20:45,049
we're on part of them and marijuana was

489
00:20:42,049 --> 00:20:49,609
a professor of homology here until 2013

490
00:20:45,049 --> 00:20:51,769
and Eve cidery anyone heard of them so

491
00:20:49,609 --> 00:20:54,049
she's actually the person that I met in

492
00:20:51,769 --> 00:20:57,079
2000 when I discovered that farming was

493
00:20:54,049 --> 00:20:58,549
cool because I worked for her and at

494
00:20:57,079 --> 00:21:02,179
that I didn't realize she was like

495
00:20:58,549 --> 00:21:04,549
almost my age she was 21 and I was 19

496
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:07,490
and I was here amazing you're ageless

497
00:21:04,549 --> 00:21:10,369
like who are you and I feel really lucky

498
00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:12,650
because she's been my mentor since 2000

499
00:21:10,369 --> 00:21:14,419
and has been making cider that entire

500
00:21:12,650 --> 00:21:17,240
time so she actually qualifies as one of

501
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:19,550
the longest-running sort of method Shemp

502
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:21,500
and masai therese in the country and is

503
00:21:19,549 --> 00:21:24,409
very nationally recognized for her

504
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:25,910
quality and struggles enormous ly to get

505
00:21:24,410 --> 00:21:27,470
the price that she needs to get for her

506
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:31,279
cider it's crazy

507
00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:33,319
it should she's 75% her own fruit so

508
00:21:31,279 --> 00:21:34,579
between the four of us that's the story

509
00:21:33,319 --> 00:21:37,849
we're trying to tell in the cider house

510
00:21:34,579 --> 00:21:39,829
and the Tiger has his own like super

511
00:21:37,849 --> 00:21:41,959
conundrum of like collaboration is

512
00:21:39,829 --> 00:21:44,839
awesome but not if the risk isn't shared

513
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:47,420
and there's a whole bunch of stuff about

514
00:21:44,839 --> 00:21:49,220
that that has been very confusing but

515
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:51,170
what I keep coming back to is like if

516
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:54,170
we're trying to support small family

517
00:21:51,170 --> 00:21:56,000
farms who are truly producing their own

518
00:21:54,170 --> 00:21:58,490
fruit and paying like a lot of attention

519
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,410
to like what is the microbial makeup on

520
00:21:58,490 --> 00:22:02,150
the skin of this fruit and how is it

521
00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:05,029
going to make our cider really

522
00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:07,070
interesting and really delicious we have

523
00:22:05,029 --> 00:22:09,019
to be telling our stories loudly as some

524
00:22:07,069 --> 00:22:12,169
of our competitors who have a marketing

525
00:22:09,019 --> 00:22:15,200
budget any marketing person and who are

526
00:22:12,170 --> 00:22:19,990
not paying almost anything for juice so

527
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:22,549
I think everybody showed us a lot of in

528
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:24,890
2014 when we presented the idea to those

529
00:22:22,549 --> 00:22:27,079
other side erease they showed us a lot

530
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:29,150
of faith because we were saying like

531
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:31,399
look our farm is a great place for this

532
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:34,430
we can build the building we can find

533
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:37,490
the funding which is crazy that we did

534
00:22:34,430 --> 00:22:39,980
and we will run the tasting room for all

535
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:41,779
of us on all of our behalf and over that

536
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:43,819
time it's become really clear to my

537
00:22:41,779 --> 00:22:44,990
husband and I I don't know if you heard

538
00:22:43,819 --> 00:22:47,059
in my story so far

539
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:49,430
is there any background in hospitality

540
00:22:47,059 --> 00:22:51,089
that I mentioned any background and

541
00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:53,400
classes no we had

542
00:22:51,089 --> 00:22:56,159
no idea what we were getting into it was

543
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:58,170
crazy we were just like sure that we

544
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:59,759
could do it and I I was talking to

545
00:22:58,170 --> 00:23:01,050
Stefan last night actually and it's

546
00:22:59,759 --> 00:23:02,670
funny because I told him I was coming

547
00:23:01,049 --> 00:23:05,879
here and he didn't tell me he'd give a

548
00:23:02,670 --> 00:23:07,740
talk of course I was just like Stefan my

549
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:09,060
head is scrambled like help me what

550
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:11,910
should I say here's what he told me to

551
00:23:09,059 --> 00:23:12,509
say he said say ask him ask me about my

552
00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:15,150
business

553
00:23:12,509 --> 00:23:17,789
ask me what inspires me ask me what

554
00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:19,200
terrifies me and and then see what

555
00:23:17,789 --> 00:23:20,609
happens and I haven't done that yet but

556
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:22,110
that's kind of where I'd like to leave

557
00:23:20,609 --> 00:23:24,779
it at this point and open it up to

558
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:26,909
questions I hope we can have the rest of

559
00:23:24,779 --> 00:23:28,289
this be and I didn't really do my slide

560
00:23:26,910 --> 00:23:30,360
show I'm not really concerned with my

561
00:23:28,289 --> 00:23:31,740
slide show at this point like whatever

562
00:23:30,359 --> 00:23:34,829
I'll go through the rest of pictures if

563
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:37,019
you want me to but I would love to just

564
00:23:34,829 --> 00:23:42,000
talk to you guys and I hope I kind of

565
00:23:37,019 --> 00:23:44,779
laid out what our businesses are Paul

566
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,779
thank you

567
00:23:46,410 --> 00:23:54,769
pointing their farm career that you're

568
00:23:49,410 --> 00:23:54,769
in immigration sorts of realities

569
00:24:02,339 --> 00:24:06,490
also cuz you ran into me at 4 o'clock

570
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:12,340
and asked me how I was doing and I was

571
00:24:06,490 --> 00:24:14,339
like okay that's a great question thank

572
00:24:12,339 --> 00:24:18,389
you

573
00:24:14,339 --> 00:24:21,879
this continues to be what inspires me

574
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:25,000
this is a picture of my cow herd being

575
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:27,640
followed by my turkey flock and I feel

576
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:29,589
really really strongly about the kind of

577
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:32,050
agriculture we're doing and I feel

578
00:24:29,589 --> 00:24:35,049
really really well educated about how

579
00:24:32,049 --> 00:24:37,059
expensive it is to do it this is my

580
00:24:35,049 --> 00:24:38,710
original cow herd there were three

581
00:24:37,059 --> 00:24:41,859
animals in it and two of them were

582
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:44,799
female and one of them we ate and so

583
00:24:41,859 --> 00:24:46,809
this is like yay yay

584
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:50,500
obviously I bought a couple more mom's

585
00:24:46,809 --> 00:24:54,220
eyes in 2012 get to 18 just my own

586
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:56,440
breeding but um I feel like so my bet

587
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:58,870
this gives me a chance to say like my

588
00:24:56,440 --> 00:25:01,750
people often ask me like oh did you go

589
00:24:58,869 --> 00:25:04,569
to Cornell for soccer and I'm sorry Tom

590
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:06,369
but I bought was like no except only did

591
00:25:04,569 --> 00:25:09,009
it because when I was an undergrad here

592
00:25:06,369 --> 00:25:10,779
I took the only class that I took that

593
00:25:09,009 --> 00:25:12,069
resonated the most with me was Tom what

594
00:25:10,779 --> 00:25:14,649
was class I don't know if you know him

595
00:25:12,069 --> 00:25:16,119
but he's my old advisor he's here and

596
00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:17,610
he's my dear friend please raise your

597
00:25:16,119 --> 00:25:20,199
hand

598
00:25:17,609 --> 00:25:22,599
thank you he teaches a class called

599
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:24,789
restoration ecology and that was where I

600
00:25:22,599 --> 00:25:27,939
was at for my entire career as a student

601
00:25:24,789 --> 00:25:30,399
here was much more interested like the

602
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:31,930
natural world than the agricultural

603
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:33,700
world and at the same time every summer

604
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:35,560
I was working on farms I worked on

605
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:38,140
remembrance farmer to stick in stone I

606
00:25:35,559 --> 00:25:41,529
worked for Indians not any tree cab

607
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:42,070
sorry what's the big picture didn't own

608
00:25:41,529 --> 00:25:44,289
it anymore

609
00:25:42,069 --> 00:25:46,809
the sister farm to Indian Creek that is

610
00:25:44,289 --> 00:25:51,519
no longer sister farm anyway we're

611
00:25:46,809 --> 00:25:55,839
autumn west what no in new field on

612
00:25:51,519 --> 00:25:59,200
Shaffer Road like the James come and

613
00:25:55,839 --> 00:26:03,099
started but anyway it's not a hobby of

614
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:05,140
cidery sorry and all that whole time I

615
00:26:03,099 --> 00:26:07,149
was thinking like this is fun but it's

616
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:08,680
not a thing like people don't make their

617
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:10,630
money this way and they don't make a

618
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:12,549
living this way and certainly like the

619
00:26:10,630 --> 00:26:15,010
people I was working for were either

620
00:26:12,549 --> 00:26:15,230
still working full time jobs a farm or

621
00:26:15,009 --> 00:26:17,690
part

622
00:26:15,230 --> 00:26:19,429
time jobs are just struggling and those

623
00:26:17,690 --> 00:26:22,690
farms have all evolved to be like full

624
00:26:19,429 --> 00:26:26,000
family operations at this point but I

625
00:26:22,690 --> 00:26:28,419
never really thought a Greek I just

626
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:31,970
always thought like restoration or

627
00:26:28,419 --> 00:26:33,950
conservation and I think it was signing

628
00:26:31,970 --> 00:26:36,740
out about permaculture that really

629
00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:38,058
turned that corner for me and then

630
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:40,880
getting in lots and lots of arguments

631
00:26:38,058 --> 00:26:43,308
with grain and vegetable farmers about

632
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:44,750
what jerks permaculture list could be

633
00:26:43,308 --> 00:26:46,369
because I would say like ten years ago

634
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:48,829
the movement was in a different place

635
00:26:46,369 --> 00:26:51,279
and it was a lot more antagonistic and I

636
00:26:48,829 --> 00:26:53,629
think there's a much better recognition

637
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:55,759
from the permaculture side about the

638
00:26:53,630 --> 00:26:58,429
value of these are small organic farms

639
00:26:55,759 --> 00:26:59,808
and I feel really lucky Paul that I have

640
00:26:58,429 --> 00:27:02,179
my animals to wake up to every morning

641
00:26:59,808 --> 00:27:03,349
because what has evolved the Rio and I

642
00:27:02,179 --> 00:27:05,120
would say yes my inspiration has

643
00:27:03,349 --> 00:27:07,399
Warrenton because I've turned into like

644
00:27:05,119 --> 00:27:09,019
a master administrator I do all the

645
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:12,559
marketing I do all the staff management

646
00:27:09,019 --> 00:27:15,859
I have 17 employees I used to have one

647
00:27:12,558 --> 00:27:17,418
I find the money I spend the money I

648
00:27:15,859 --> 00:27:21,678
account for the fact that we have no

649
00:27:17,419 --> 00:27:24,140
money and luckily I still have livestock

650
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:26,120
that's like my main thing is like I I

651
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:28,520
have to do the chores so in the morning

652
00:27:26,119 --> 00:27:30,199
and in the evening I'm still a farmer

653
00:27:28,519 --> 00:27:33,650
whether I can afford to be a farmer in

654
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:35,750
the middle of the day and I think as

655
00:27:33,650 --> 00:27:39,350
we've gotten kind of pounded in the

656
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:40,069
cider house by attention and our lack of

657
00:27:39,349 --> 00:27:43,639
experience

658
00:27:40,069 --> 00:27:45,740
I keep really saying that people still

659
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:46,940
tend to but but maybe not because you

660
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:48,200
guys have all been there and you didn't

661
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:49,700
know about the good life farm but let's

662
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:53,259
pretend that what I'm saying is true and

663
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:53,259
then you can tell me it's not later

664
00:27:53,589 --> 00:27:58,490
people know that they're on a working

665
00:27:55,880 --> 00:28:00,169
farm to some degree and that that feels

666
00:27:58,490 --> 00:28:02,329
different and that they see that we

667
00:28:00,169 --> 00:28:05,570
treat our place like with a lot of

668
00:28:02,329 --> 00:28:06,889
reverence and I think it tends to be

669
00:28:05,569 --> 00:28:08,450
like one of the best educational

670
00:28:06,890 --> 00:28:11,720
experiences a lot of people can have

671
00:28:08,450 --> 00:28:13,160
which is why we have this festival which

672
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:14,600
is a Memorial Day weekend and then

673
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:16,519
you're all welcome to come it's called

674
00:28:14,599 --> 00:28:18,349
it's organza and we've been having it

675
00:28:16,519 --> 00:28:21,440
for six years because we planted two

676
00:28:18,349 --> 00:28:24,079
acres of asparagus which is a lot if you

677
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:25,650
are curious it is four miles of walking

678
00:28:24,079 --> 00:28:28,169
if one person has two

679
00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:31,410
harvested by themselves can we never do

680
00:28:28,170 --> 00:28:32,759
that ever I used to and I remember like

681
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:35,400
I had a mental breakdown once in the

682
00:28:32,759 --> 00:28:36,808
middle of it and I walked away and so

683
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:40,890
now it's like a four or five person

684
00:28:36,808 --> 00:28:44,789
thing and yeah I think what I need to do

685
00:28:40,890 --> 00:28:46,620
better to keep myself happy is is is be

686
00:28:44,789 --> 00:28:49,950
out there like giving farm tours and

687
00:28:46,619 --> 00:28:51,599
explaining this to people so that that

688
00:28:49,950 --> 00:28:53,789
proportion of hand-raising let's do it

689
00:28:51,599 --> 00:28:56,609
again who knew about the Finger Lakes

690
00:28:53,789 --> 00:28:59,759
cider house okay and before this who

691
00:28:56,609 --> 00:29:02,779
knew about the good life farm ok well

692
00:28:59,759 --> 00:29:05,700
that I feel like it was like different I

693
00:29:02,779 --> 00:29:07,589
really do yeah I feel you're all

694
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:11,370
cheating it seemed to me like it was

695
00:29:07,589 --> 00:29:13,769
like half I think we need to do a better

696
00:29:11,369 --> 00:29:15,299
job with that because we want to connect

697
00:29:13,769 --> 00:29:18,509
people to like the quality of what

698
00:29:15,299 --> 00:29:19,919
they're tasting to something that's real

699
00:29:18,509 --> 00:29:21,960
and something they can support and

700
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:24,269
that's like an incredible capitalist

701
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:27,480
construct right like that we would use

702
00:29:24,269 --> 00:29:30,299
our dollars are purchasing dollars to

703
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:32,579
make things better for people and at the

704
00:29:30,299 --> 00:29:35,609
same time like in the cider house it is

705
00:29:32,579 --> 00:29:37,889
totally true for us like it is totally

706
00:29:35,609 --> 00:29:39,449
worked out that way so yeah I decided

707
00:29:37,890 --> 00:29:45,240
did that answer your question or not you

708
00:29:39,450 --> 00:29:51,090
want to ask it again yeah oh yes right I

709
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:54,390
did i okay yeah um we had a picture of

710
00:29:51,089 --> 00:29:57,250
it somewhere why'd you with your

711
00:29:54,390 --> 00:30:01,750
pointed wanting it becoming more your

712
00:29:57,250 --> 00:30:06,819
motivation to half working and brother

713
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:12,069
oh it's the same the same thing I mean I

714
00:30:06,819 --> 00:30:13,839
feel like it was so from 2009 to May of

715
00:30:12,069 --> 00:30:16,299
last year so not quite a year we did not

716
00:30:13,839 --> 00:30:19,509
have a tractor and for a long time that

717
00:30:16,299 --> 00:30:21,519
was fine this is how we moved grain

718
00:30:19,509 --> 00:30:22,930
really big quantities of grain for our

719
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:24,279
turkeys and we moved our turkeys all

720
00:30:22,930 --> 00:30:26,380
over the farm so this is like they're

721
00:30:24,279 --> 00:30:28,180
feeding vessel and then on the days I

722
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:30,520
would move it I would load it up behind

723
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:32,620
like in between the wheels and move it

724
00:30:30,519 --> 00:30:35,440
and the turkey is like yes this is so

725
00:30:32,619 --> 00:30:36,969
great we are so happy about this and you

726
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:39,580
can't see if they actually are fenced

727
00:30:36,970 --> 00:30:40,990
like you don't invest that much and

728
00:30:39,579 --> 00:30:45,220
livestock and then nothing

729
00:30:40,990 --> 00:30:47,079
no they are and so I think that that was

730
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:48,910
like a nice system was very light and I

731
00:30:47,079 --> 00:30:50,349
think I started to sort of feel like

732
00:30:48,910 --> 00:30:52,990
everything we did was really like a

733
00:30:50,349 --> 00:30:54,339
light touch one of the problems was we

734
00:30:52,990 --> 00:30:56,529
were also touching our compost very

735
00:30:54,339 --> 00:30:58,149
lightly which meant that we weren't

736
00:30:56,529 --> 00:31:00,190
flipping international we're making very

737
00:30:58,150 --> 00:31:02,110
nice compost and as we started to have

738
00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:04,900
Apple pomace coming off the presses it

739
00:31:02,109 --> 00:31:07,509
was like a legitimate issue that turn

740
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:10,050
into a rat problem and then we were

741
00:31:07,509 --> 00:31:15,220
starting to get these bottle orders so

742
00:31:10,049 --> 00:31:17,680
we made seventy five hundred gallons

743
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:19,750
which is nothing like it

744
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:24,450
last year it is how much does your son

745
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:27,309
making not that much you've so URI

746
00:31:24,450 --> 00:31:29,950
capped out at ten thousand red bird

747
00:31:27,309 --> 00:31:32,980
never makes more than three Black

748
00:31:29,950 --> 00:31:34,539
Diamond made three and so it would make

749
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:36,190
use the biggest us the next and the

750
00:31:34,539 --> 00:31:38,680
other two just like so much smaller just

751
00:31:36,190 --> 00:31:41,170
for a proportion meanwhile like do you

752
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:44,289
have any statistics on wineries in your

753
00:31:41,170 --> 00:31:45,910
head that doesn't touch the wineries

754
00:31:44,289 --> 00:31:48,460
around here that's not even a small

755
00:31:45,910 --> 00:31:50,110
winery like it's just and we're having a

756
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:51,759
very hard time like getting people to

757
00:31:50,109 --> 00:31:55,169
recognize like a fifteen to twenty

758
00:31:51,759 --> 00:31:57,579
dollar price point for our product but

759
00:31:55,170 --> 00:32:01,060
where the hell am I going with this

760
00:31:57,579 --> 00:32:02,470
oh right so the thing with always

761
00:32:01,059 --> 00:32:04,149
wanting to do everything the hardest

762
00:32:02,470 --> 00:32:06,339
possible way and the most

763
00:32:04,150 --> 00:32:07,350
labor-intensive possible way is at some

764
00:32:06,339 --> 00:32:08,899
point it gets really

765
00:32:07,349 --> 00:32:12,689
offensive and you can measure it and

766
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:14,910
when we started really measuring it or

767
00:32:12,690 --> 00:32:16,950
like losing out on the opportunity to

768
00:32:14,910 --> 00:32:18,480
get really good freight freight rates

769
00:32:16,950 --> 00:32:19,830
for our bottles because we couldn't

770
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:23,700
order them in a quantity because it

771
00:32:19,829 --> 00:32:25,500
couldn't unload them that became an

772
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:29,090
issue where we got a tractor but and

773
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:33,150
that at that point I started to have a

774
00:32:29,089 --> 00:32:35,220
separation of I would say direction with

775
00:32:33,150 --> 00:32:37,500
my husband so at this point the horses

776
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:40,890
are my animals and I have to make sure

777
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:42,179
that they work the thing is that you did

778
00:32:40,890 --> 00:32:43,830
everyone experience those rain storms

779
00:32:42,179 --> 00:32:44,759
last Wednesday Thursday and Friday is

780
00:32:43,829 --> 00:32:46,949
crazy

781
00:32:44,759 --> 00:32:48,599
well I Reno - hey my cows aren't on

782
00:32:46,950 --> 00:32:50,159
grass quite yet I'd be like wait for it

783
00:32:48,599 --> 00:32:52,109
to get to a certain height because

784
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:54,150
they'll just mow it down right away so

785
00:32:52,109 --> 00:32:56,189
to get hay out to my cows on Friday and

786
00:32:54,150 --> 00:32:58,620
the idea of driving a tractor and that

787
00:32:56,190 --> 00:33:00,419
is like you're committing to ruts for

788
00:32:58,619 --> 00:33:02,428
the rest of your life right but I didn't

789
00:33:00,419 --> 00:33:04,049
have to do that I was able to load it

790
00:33:02,429 --> 00:33:06,090
onto this sled which is not in this

791
00:33:04,048 --> 00:33:08,569
picture and get it out to the pasture

792
00:33:06,089 --> 00:33:11,069
and no damage done so there's always

793
00:33:08,569 --> 00:33:13,529
it's nice to have something that's four

794
00:33:11,069 --> 00:33:15,149
footed you know like it can get through

795
00:33:13,529 --> 00:33:17,190
anything it's an animal like it's like

796
00:33:15,150 --> 00:33:18,890
you you can jump over a log like they

797
00:33:17,190 --> 00:33:21,570
can jump over logs so we still have

798
00:33:18,890 --> 00:33:23,759
legitimate jobs for them we've been we

799
00:33:21,569 --> 00:33:27,269
pulled 200 locust posts out of our woods

800
00:33:23,759 --> 00:33:28,500
over the past two months on behalf of

801
00:33:27,269 --> 00:33:31,038
them we pulled out with the horses they

802
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:34,200
were in a creek you know are like in

803
00:33:31,038 --> 00:33:35,759
behind a tree under a bush like really

804
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:38,640
hard to get with the tractor or way too

805
00:33:35,759 --> 00:33:42,029
big for a human to lift onto the tractor

806
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:43,860
Forks I insist on doing the tillage and

807
00:33:42,029 --> 00:33:46,139
it's like almost is doing her hobby

808
00:33:43,859 --> 00:33:48,869
right now like her farm work hobby

809
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:51,538
because it's like half as efficient at

810
00:33:48,869 --> 00:33:53,729
this point but the thing is because once

811
00:33:51,538 --> 00:33:55,619
you have a tractor like you're you're in

812
00:33:53,730 --> 00:33:57,329
it like you have a tractor why don't you

813
00:33:55,619 --> 00:33:58,859
have implements for your tractor and the

814
00:33:57,329 --> 00:34:01,019
lucky thing I feel like is we own no

815
00:33:58,859 --> 00:34:02,819
implements for our tractor so at this

816
00:34:01,019 --> 00:34:06,058
one we won't have a choice but that's

817
00:34:02,819 --> 00:34:07,769
one of those difficult things where he's

818
00:34:06,058 --> 00:34:09,358
he's going in one direction I'm going

819
00:34:07,769 --> 00:34:12,300
the other and I basically I'm like well

820
00:34:09,358 --> 00:34:15,210
they'll just be mine then and that'll be

821
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:19,889
my hobby so I don't know a little bit of

822
00:34:15,210 --> 00:34:20,710
a challenge I don't know any any horse

823
00:34:19,889 --> 00:34:23,460
farms

824
00:34:20,710 --> 00:34:25,690
again correct me some wrong that are

825
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:27,369
either not split operation which means

826
00:34:25,690 --> 00:34:30,068
they own a tractor and they do like

827
00:34:27,369 --> 00:34:31,780
their efficient stuff with tractors or

828
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:33,730
that aren't supporting that with an off

829
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:37,089
arm job I don't know of a single one

830
00:34:33,730 --> 00:34:39,309
does anybody yeah so I'm supporting it

831
00:34:37,088 --> 00:34:43,949
with the cider house and it's a great

832
00:34:39,309 --> 00:34:43,950
marketing yeah

833
00:34:48,949 --> 00:34:54,109
like into the orchards yes isube

834
00:34:55,190 --> 00:35:00,269
they are shot on blood out on farm and

835
00:34:58,199 --> 00:35:02,730
then they're butchered off farm so

836
00:35:00,269 --> 00:35:06,869
that's a very specific way to do it

837
00:35:02,730 --> 00:35:08,730
which is called custom cut and we means

838
00:35:06,869 --> 00:35:10,799
that we sign up all of our customers

839
00:35:08,730 --> 00:35:12,300
before while they're still alive agree

840
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:13,680
on a cut sheet and at that point and

841
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:17,580
they pay a deposit so at that point they

842
00:35:13,679 --> 00:35:19,379
own the animal and that allows us to do

843
00:35:17,579 --> 00:35:23,759
that and it's a super beautiful thing

844
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:25,230
it's the only I I don't want to have a

845
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:26,880
hundred cows because I don't want to

846
00:35:25,230 --> 00:35:29,369
stop being able to do that I really

847
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:33,599
really value the lack of transport

848
00:35:29,369 --> 00:35:36,389
before slaughter so yeah I way too

849
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:38,630
intimate with my account it's really not

850
00:35:36,389 --> 00:35:38,629
healthy

851
00:35:39,650 --> 00:35:44,369
yeah do we want to see another picture a

852
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:49,380
really cute little guy

853
00:35:44,369 --> 00:35:52,409
or did he go yeah they are so great when

854
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:54,539
they're and then like this is like just

855
00:35:52,409 --> 00:35:56,670
born and I'm like hello Here I am let me

856
00:35:54,539 --> 00:35:58,440
stab you let me capture you let me put a

857
00:35:56,670 --> 00:36:01,050
tag in your ear and then like a day

858
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:03,750
later there's no catching just like

859
00:36:01,050 --> 00:36:05,190
cannot get a hold of them so this is the

860
00:36:03,750 --> 00:36:07,139
beginning of calving season so in our

861
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:09,539
farm like from now until the millage in

862
00:36:07,139 --> 00:36:11,489
is like it's sort of like running a

863
00:36:09,539 --> 00:36:12,719
sprint for the entire time it's like

864
00:36:11,489 --> 00:36:14,279
planting trees picking asparagus

865
00:36:12,719 --> 00:36:15,989
spelling it all delivering it all

866
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:18,090
remembering that the tasting room is

867
00:36:15,989 --> 00:36:20,279
open trying to find the calves that have

868
00:36:18,090 --> 00:36:21,750
been born and often when they're born in

869
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:23,940
tall grass like we try to calves on

870
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:28,079
grass there's a lot of finding them

871
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:31,050
involved running after them weeping and

872
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:32,819
catching them and that's like you missed

873
00:36:31,050 --> 00:36:35,990
it if you're doing that some things are

874
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:38,990
too old but yeah any other questions

875
00:36:35,989 --> 00:36:38,989
yeah

876
00:36:41,750 --> 00:36:51,420
looks like everything how are you been

877
00:36:44,309 --> 00:36:52,858
in there oh yeah like oh my god so I

878
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:55,019
actually texted one of my employees

879
00:36:52,858 --> 00:36:56,880
because she's a master student in plant

880
00:36:55,019 --> 00:36:58,920
science of science I was like will you

881
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:00,510
come I wasn't like really wanted to call

882
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:04,190
on her cuz she's been with us for two

883
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:07,050
years her her friend at a seminar um I

884
00:37:04,190 --> 00:37:08,460
think that the naivete was actually like

885
00:37:07,050 --> 00:37:11,220
a good thing in some ways because there

886
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:12,960
was like a fresh approach but there was

887
00:37:11,219 --> 00:37:15,509
also like just a lot of really dumb

888
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:18,510
stuff about like how do we take orders

889
00:37:15,510 --> 00:37:20,460
for food let's design a system like not

890
00:37:18,510 --> 00:37:24,359
like let's use a system that restaurants

891
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:26,068
use you know and so okay what so we

892
00:37:24,358 --> 00:37:28,588
think we're great systems thinkers right

893
00:37:26,068 --> 00:37:30,269
like that is the entire concept in

894
00:37:28,588 --> 00:37:31,980
permaculture it's not like we totally

895
00:37:30,269 --> 00:37:34,259
screwed it up it's like we totally tried

896
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:36,659
to make it up from scratch but it was so

897
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:39,030
naive and it caused us a lot of stress

898
00:37:36,659 --> 00:37:40,920
and luckily my husband and I worked

899
00:37:39,030 --> 00:37:42,990
every Friday and every Saturday for the

900
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:45,389
first two years of that business so we

901
00:37:42,989 --> 00:37:47,159
were there to take heat or to fix the

902
00:37:45,389 --> 00:37:49,980
problem but can you imagine what that

903
00:37:47,159 --> 00:37:52,259
did us to our farm I mean I worked

904
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:56,099
probably 20 hours not like managing but

905
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:59,970
like actually doing a shift so yeah our

906
00:37:56,099 --> 00:38:01,859
farm really really suffered and 2015 was

907
00:37:59,969 --> 00:38:03,989
a great fruit year it was a really tough

908
00:38:01,858 --> 00:38:06,000
year for us like getting things picked

909
00:38:03,989 --> 00:38:08,068
and remembering that's it like I my

910
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:11,369
sister came to visit in August and I was

911
00:38:08,068 --> 00:38:13,829
like oh um I think it's but like the

912
00:38:11,369 --> 00:38:15,930
vivid variety of peaches isn't ripe and

913
00:38:13,829 --> 00:38:18,089
Matt is on vacation our farm manager and

914
00:38:15,929 --> 00:38:19,440
she was like aha okay I think well I

915
00:38:18,088 --> 00:38:23,940
think I work in the tasting for six

916
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:26,220
hours can you pick it my sister pixie I

917
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:27,809
mean you know it was just like oh my god

918
00:38:26,219 --> 00:38:30,239
like what are you thinking like you have

919
00:38:27,809 --> 00:38:32,549
to work these chefs like you should not

920
00:38:30,239 --> 00:38:35,279
think that you're a farmer the whole

921
00:38:32,550 --> 00:38:36,750
time you're in there like be clean be

922
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:40,050
ready and don't be stressed out about it

923
00:38:36,750 --> 00:38:41,429
I think that's like probably anyone

924
00:38:40,050 --> 00:38:44,910
who's ever worked in a restaurant once

925
00:38:41,429 --> 00:38:46,799
like knows that right so I think it's

926
00:38:44,909 --> 00:38:48,838
like hilarious now but it was enormous

927
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:50,880
ly stressful and I'm not saying it's

928
00:38:48,838 --> 00:38:52,409
fixed but one of the things that Gary

929
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:53,630
and I realized is for us to do a good

930
00:38:52,409 --> 00:38:55,578
job for armed

931
00:38:53,630 --> 00:38:56,809
and for our farm like we actually can't

932
00:38:55,579 --> 00:38:59,990
hold those shifts anymore

933
00:38:56,809 --> 00:39:01,069
so as of January we don't work on

934
00:38:59,989 --> 00:39:05,558
Saturdays anymore

935
00:39:01,068 --> 00:39:09,349
mm-hmm ha ha but we come in all the time

936
00:39:05,559 --> 00:39:15,048
ruffle everybody's feathers so yeah any

937
00:39:09,349 --> 00:39:22,068
other questions so am I going over okay

938
00:39:15,048 --> 00:39:23,960
I probably you're pretty young started a

939
00:39:22,068 --> 00:39:26,778
little bit not so I started about an

940
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:34,009
ally your husband fun you love when your

941
00:39:26,778 --> 00:39:35,989
buyers are and what was that like like

942
00:39:34,009 --> 00:39:40,818
what's going into it was there ever that

943
00:39:35,989 --> 00:39:44,409
thought of being young how do I start

944
00:39:40,818 --> 00:39:44,409
this thing saying goodbye

945
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:51,739
there are a lot of people in here who

946
00:39:47,929 --> 00:39:53,598
knew me at that time I so you guys can

947
00:39:51,739 --> 00:39:57,739
feel I can't you were actually kind of

948
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:59,590
an but I think that we just

949
00:39:57,739 --> 00:40:03,199
really thought we could and I think

950
00:39:59,590 --> 00:40:06,260
honestly some 35 now I feel like there's

951
00:40:03,199 --> 00:40:08,210
a lot of arrogance there and that so I

952
00:40:06,260 --> 00:40:10,130
used to give tours specifically to the

953
00:40:08,210 --> 00:40:12,230
permaculture design class that there's

954
00:40:10,130 --> 00:40:14,630
one held in Ithaca every year and I

955
00:40:12,230 --> 00:40:16,400
remember after one of them like I was

956
00:40:14,630 --> 00:40:19,039
just really we just really got a handed

957
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:23,570
to us like constantly like we were just

958
00:40:19,039 --> 00:40:28,369
so tired and so overworked and so

959
00:40:23,570 --> 00:40:29,990
confused about like not our vision our

960
00:40:28,369 --> 00:40:31,608
vision was very clear to us but we were

961
00:40:29,989 --> 00:40:34,339
confused about how to maintain the rest

962
00:40:31,608 --> 00:40:35,539
of our lives like this I keep coming

963
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:39,140
back to this because I really feel like

964
00:40:35,539 --> 00:40:41,239
we we traded on this and one of the

965
00:40:39,139 --> 00:40:43,159
things that really helped me stop

966
00:40:41,239 --> 00:40:44,569
trading on that or like have a desire to

967
00:40:43,159 --> 00:40:46,399
stop trading on it was to have employees

968
00:40:44,570 --> 00:40:47,780
and realize that like I did not want to

969
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:50,329
subject them to the conditions I'd

970
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:51,950
subjected myself to and what it like

971
00:40:50,329 --> 00:40:53,838
what did I want to be as an employer

972
00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:55,848
especially in the tasting because you

973
00:40:53,838 --> 00:40:57,920
could see it immediately like if if

974
00:40:55,849 --> 00:40:59,720
you're stressed out and you enter after

975
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:05,059
the customer like everybody's stressed

976
00:40:59,719 --> 00:41:06,439
out like it's terrible and so as I've

977
00:41:05,059 --> 00:41:08,869
been stepping back from the tasting room

978
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:10,760
and are like from working in it and

979
00:41:08,869 --> 00:41:12,829
trying to support my staff like I try to

980
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:15,109
treat them like they're the most

981
00:41:12,829 --> 00:41:16,639
important for lack of a better way to

982
00:41:15,108 --> 00:41:18,170
describe it like customer make sure

983
00:41:16,639 --> 00:41:21,739
they're really happy and comfortable and

984
00:41:18,170 --> 00:41:23,750
I think we were really really naive

985
00:41:21,739 --> 00:41:26,389
about what we were going to need for

986
00:41:23,750 --> 00:41:28,550
ourselves so we didn't manage have

987
00:41:26,389 --> 00:41:31,909
children in those 10 years and all of

988
00:41:28,550 --> 00:41:33,800
our friends has at this point and I'm

989
00:41:31,909 --> 00:41:38,269
not saying we're not going to but I

990
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:40,460
think I feel like we made a big trade

991
00:41:38,269 --> 00:41:41,869
and it's really clear to me at this

992
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:42,980
point what it was and I don't know that

993
00:41:41,869 --> 00:41:45,079
I would do it again I'm not trying to

994
00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:46,338
make this like sound terrible but I

995
00:41:45,079 --> 00:41:49,009
don't think you have to make those

996
00:41:46,338 --> 00:41:51,170
trades if you're not so silly about some

997
00:41:49,010 --> 00:41:54,859
things one thing that would have been a

998
00:41:51,170 --> 00:41:56,690
lot easier like to go back to this is to

999
00:41:54,858 --> 00:41:58,139
buy a piece of land with like any

1000
00:41:56,690 --> 00:42:02,309
building on

1001
00:41:58,139 --> 00:42:04,828
like at all Oh like a barn like there

1002
00:42:02,309 --> 00:42:06,778
was a water there wasn't a driveway like

1003
00:42:04,829 --> 00:42:08,759
you know we really we can do it and care

1004
00:42:06,778 --> 00:42:10,768
it was like I'm a builder so like I

1005
00:42:08,759 --> 00:42:13,259
don't want other people's mistakes and

1006
00:42:10,768 --> 00:42:16,348
we were like great like okay it's all

1007
00:42:13,259 --> 00:42:17,880
great so you know like it's not like

1008
00:42:16,349 --> 00:42:19,349
this house was even for sale are

1009
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:22,380
available and we didn't like turn that

1010
00:42:19,349 --> 00:42:24,298
opportunity down but most of the other

1011
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:25,318
farms we looked at like at some point

1012
00:42:24,298 --> 00:42:26,579
we're like we're not going to look at

1013
00:42:25,318 --> 00:42:28,739
farms with buildings anymore because

1014
00:42:26,579 --> 00:42:31,200
that's stupid like why would we do that

1015
00:42:28,739 --> 00:42:33,170
he's like I don't want to renovate so I

1016
00:42:31,199 --> 00:42:35,399
think that was foolish like definitely

1017
00:42:33,170 --> 00:42:38,519
not having a place to live that was

1018
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:40,170
stable but did that was the question you

1019
00:42:38,518 --> 00:42:42,209
asked me I think that was like really

1020
00:42:40,170 --> 00:42:44,999
the biggest mistake we still don't have

1021
00:42:42,210 --> 00:42:48,119
a place to live and also unfortunately

1022
00:42:44,998 --> 00:42:50,399
like this was designed to be our home

1023
00:42:48,119 --> 00:42:52,559
it's a third floor of this building and

1024
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:55,170
we run into some really funny things

1025
00:42:52,559 --> 00:42:58,319
with the code officers so like yeah oh

1026
00:42:55,170 --> 00:42:59,730
that's my sister she comes and works she

1027
00:42:58,318 --> 00:43:01,108
doesn't work for me she just comes and

1028
00:42:59,730 --> 00:43:02,909
does what I tell her and that scares

1029
00:43:01,108 --> 00:43:04,558
brother by the way so one of the things

1030
00:43:02,909 --> 00:43:06,239
I think I've been remiss and not

1031
00:43:04,559 --> 00:43:08,519
mentioning sorry I maybe I should try to

1032
00:43:06,239 --> 00:43:10,048
get through my slides on is what a

1033
00:43:08,518 --> 00:43:11,659
family operation marek don't worry about

1034
00:43:10,048 --> 00:43:16,460
my slides

1035
00:43:11,659 --> 00:43:19,588
okay well that's carrot on the outside

1036
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:22,499
matching and that's his brother and so

1037
00:43:19,588 --> 00:43:25,349
his family he's from Dryden his family

1038
00:43:22,498 --> 00:43:27,028
does live on our farm now so we build

1039
00:43:25,349 --> 00:43:28,619
our barn and then he built his mother a

1040
00:43:27,028 --> 00:43:29,998
house his mother and a stepfather and

1041
00:43:28,619 --> 00:43:32,039
they're at the bottom of our farm and

1042
00:43:29,998 --> 00:43:33,868
then his brother started his brothers

1043
00:43:32,039 --> 00:43:35,430
worked for us on and off almost every

1044
00:43:33,869 --> 00:43:38,039
year since we started and now he's our

1045
00:43:35,429 --> 00:43:39,568
cider maker and he's he was really good

1046
00:43:38,039 --> 00:43:41,670
at it and it's funny because I have

1047
00:43:39,568 --> 00:43:43,469
known Jimmy now since he was 18 and I

1048
00:43:41,670 --> 00:43:45,450
would not have told you 10 years ago

1049
00:43:43,469 --> 00:43:48,679
that he was going to be a really good

1050
00:43:45,449 --> 00:43:51,028
like award-winning cider maker but

1051
00:43:48,679 --> 00:43:52,649
that's like you know we kind of try to

1052
00:43:51,028 --> 00:43:55,710
remind people that we live in this

1053
00:43:52,650 --> 00:43:58,108
society where there's a lot of truths

1054
00:43:55,710 --> 00:44:00,480
and there's a lot of true partial truths

1055
00:43:58,108 --> 00:44:02,880
used as marketing and like what is the

1056
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:05,519
what is this place and like what is true

1057
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:07,680
about this place and I think that people

1058
00:44:05,518 --> 00:44:09,539
are tend to be very inspired by family

1059
00:44:07,679 --> 00:44:12,449
operations that are truly family

1060
00:44:09,539 --> 00:44:15,840
and I feel really lucky to have the

1061
00:44:12,449 --> 00:44:19,079
Millers as part of our operation my his

1062
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:21,210
stepfather is a master electrician so

1063
00:44:19,079 --> 00:44:23,130
like today I was like I need a stove

1064
00:44:21,210 --> 00:44:25,500
wired in tomorrow

1065
00:44:23,130 --> 00:44:26,970
like I sorry I decided to do this event

1066
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:28,920
we don't have the right equipment like I

1067
00:44:26,969 --> 00:44:31,639
found the stove but I'm not a wired like

1068
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:34,680
can you come do and he's like yeah okay

1069
00:44:31,639 --> 00:44:37,409
I'll do that for you so you know that's

1070
00:44:34,679 --> 00:44:39,449
like that's one of the nice things and I

1071
00:44:37,409 --> 00:44:41,279
think we did know getting into that that

1072
00:44:39,449 --> 00:44:43,169
we would have some level of support like

1073
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:45,480
that but I think we actually had no idea

1074
00:44:43,170 --> 00:44:49,050
the kind of support we were going to get

1075
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:52,619
it has been amazing I would say like

1076
00:44:49,050 --> 00:44:54,720
Stefan and tor like I yeah the number of

1077
00:44:52,619 --> 00:44:56,909
people that have like randomly showed up

1078
00:44:54,719 --> 00:44:59,459
for us and said like we think what

1079
00:44:56,909 --> 00:45:02,489
you're doing is cool and we also see

1080
00:44:59,460 --> 00:45:04,889
that you are ridiculous and we would

1081
00:45:02,489 --> 00:45:06,569
like to help you in some way or another

1082
00:45:04,889 --> 00:45:10,859
our bank I don't know if anyone has seen

1083
00:45:06,570 --> 00:45:12,750
our commercial but we see yeah so

1084
00:45:10,860 --> 00:45:16,829
Thomson so now we're the poster children

1085
00:45:12,750 --> 00:45:18,090
for Tompkins trust because it looks

1086
00:45:16,829 --> 00:45:19,110
successful right on the outside

1087
00:45:18,090 --> 00:45:21,840
definitely people are like you were

1088
00:45:19,110 --> 00:45:24,630
successful I know like maybe we'll talk

1089
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:27,870
about that in 15 years but we're a

1090
00:45:24,630 --> 00:45:33,539
really big client of Tompkins trust and

1091
00:45:27,869 --> 00:45:35,400
they wanted a heteronormative couple for

1092
00:45:33,539 --> 00:45:36,929
their commercial I mean yeah definitely

1093
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:38,490
and then it turned out they kept

1094
00:45:36,929 --> 00:45:41,250
interviewing me and I have like a really

1095
00:45:38,489 --> 00:45:43,859
bad speaking voice went on recordings I

1096
00:45:41,250 --> 00:45:45,360
found like like I'm in a hole and I was

1097
00:45:43,860 --> 00:45:46,920
like you should really interview Garrett

1098
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:49,410
he's much more interesting and they were

1099
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:50,820
like no and i6y and they're like we want

1100
00:45:49,409 --> 00:45:53,549
a woman

1101
00:45:50,820 --> 00:45:55,410
as we go why I got it so we're we have a

1102
00:45:53,550 --> 00:45:55,950
commercial and I was me talking and it's

1103
00:45:55,409 --> 00:45:57,929
embarrassing

1104
00:45:55,949 --> 00:46:00,210
but it's very very beautiful they did it

1105
00:45:57,929 --> 00:46:02,009
I thought I did a great job so these are

1106
00:46:00,210 --> 00:46:03,780
the kind of things and they I think they

1107
00:46:02,010 --> 00:46:05,580
didn't like pay us for that but I feel

1108
00:46:03,780 --> 00:46:09,320
like they must give us every loan we ask

1109
00:46:05,579 --> 00:46:14,969
for at this point how could they say no

1110
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:18,330
right so anyway let's see what else we

1111
00:46:14,969 --> 00:46:19,319
got that's Ellen my sister yeah fun so

1112
00:46:18,329 --> 00:46:21,090
this is what it looks like inside the

1113
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:24,240
tasting room we do a lot of events like

1114
00:46:21,090 --> 00:46:26,970
this you can't really see this but one

1115
00:46:24,239 --> 00:46:30,389
of the things we're trying to do is we

1116
00:46:26,969 --> 00:46:31,980
started out two years ago serving 100%

1117
00:46:30,389 --> 00:46:35,429
local which means there were like

1118
00:46:31,980 --> 00:46:37,949
significant spices missing from our menu

1119
00:46:35,429 --> 00:46:39,599
like black pepper and there was a really

1120
00:46:37,949 --> 00:46:41,909
funny article written and tasting table

1121
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:43,889
about us not using black pepper and I

1122
00:46:41,909 --> 00:46:45,629
was like that's what you got from your

1123
00:46:43,889 --> 00:46:47,039
experience here it's like the same thing

1124
00:46:45,630 --> 00:46:50,610
like Forbes came and they wrote about

1125
00:46:47,039 --> 00:46:52,860
the bathroom when I was like what oh you

1126
00:46:50,610 --> 00:46:55,019
wrote about the bathroom so you know

1127
00:46:52,860 --> 00:46:57,599
it's like our messaging right if you

1128
00:46:55,019 --> 00:46:59,219
have to constantly and I would say this

1129
00:46:57,599 --> 00:47:02,610
another thing we had no idea like how

1130
00:46:59,219 --> 00:47:04,769
you can't talk openly to the press you

1131
00:47:02,610 --> 00:47:08,490
must have a message and you must repeat

1132
00:47:04,769 --> 00:47:09,929
it like five ways you know and so one of

1133
00:47:08,489 --> 00:47:11,519
the things we're trying to do is serve

1134
00:47:09,929 --> 00:47:13,619
our food on our friends food that they

1135
00:47:11,519 --> 00:47:16,409
grow and we want to be a good customer

1136
00:47:13,619 --> 00:47:18,839
to other farms but we also really want

1137
00:47:16,409 --> 00:47:20,909
to elevate the fact that like Finger

1138
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:23,579
Lakes food is amazing and we are trying

1139
00:47:20,909 --> 00:47:25,829
to put Finger Lakes on the map for cider

1140
00:47:23,579 --> 00:47:27,779
and for food the way Napa is on the map

1141
00:47:25,829 --> 00:47:29,730
for wine like that is what we're trying

1142
00:47:27,780 --> 00:47:31,680
to do and that is the purpose of the

1143
00:47:29,730 --> 00:47:35,550
tasting room and of any event that we

1144
00:47:31,679 --> 00:47:40,369
have this food pairing I feel like I

1145
00:47:35,550 --> 00:47:40,370
needed to say that any other questions

1146
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:46,139
yeah hi

1147
00:47:50,099 --> 00:47:56,199
the land

1148
00:47:52,460 --> 00:47:56,199
creation and competition

1149
00:47:58,730 --> 00:48:01,329
well

1150
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:06,500
we haven't been there it's really silly

1151
00:48:05,300 --> 00:48:08,570
at this point do you want to say

1152
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:08,690
something about it I would love for you

1153
00:48:08,570 --> 00:48:12,210
to

1154
00:48:08,690 --> 00:48:12,210
[Laughter]

1155
00:48:32,469 --> 00:48:43,459
right then he wrote a book I don't

1156
00:48:40,460 --> 00:48:46,880
remember the name of that do you right

1157
00:48:43,460 --> 00:48:49,039
so he is a current permaculture star I

1158
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:53,510
believe I could be wrong that he we

1159
00:48:49,039 --> 00:48:56,119
share an inspiration which is a new

1160
00:48:53,510 --> 00:48:58,250
forest farm in viola Wisconsin which is

1161
00:48:56,119 --> 00:49:00,619
where Garrett and I spent 2007 and that

1162
00:48:58,250 --> 00:49:02,960
was the first broad-scale permaculture

1163
00:49:00,619 --> 00:49:05,769
operation that we could find his 100

1164
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:08,240
acres on this basically ridge and valley

1165
00:49:05,769 --> 00:49:09,710
like the Driftless area wisconsin if

1166
00:49:08,239 --> 00:49:12,439
you're familiar with it's like the lower

1167
00:49:09,710 --> 00:49:15,230
western part of Wisconsin and it's these

1168
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:18,860
huge values and these huge ridges and

1169
00:49:15,230 --> 00:49:20,300
it's totally farmed for like it's

1170
00:49:18,860 --> 00:49:23,570
totally plowed even though these are

1171
00:49:20,300 --> 00:49:25,400
extremely steep slopes and what mark

1172
00:49:23,570 --> 00:49:28,340
would say the owner of that farm is that

1173
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:31,099
it was where the NRCS wrote the book on

1174
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:34,250
like contour plowing and I don't know if

1175
00:49:31,099 --> 00:49:37,639
it's true but he says and it's a great

1176
00:49:34,250 --> 00:49:42,949
point so he has been trying to replace

1177
00:49:37,639 --> 00:49:45,289
corn with hybrid chestnut and soy with

1178
00:49:42,949 --> 00:49:47,469
hazelnuts because originally that area

1179
00:49:45,289 --> 00:49:49,489
was savanna and when I used to have

1180
00:49:47,469 --> 00:49:50,959
presentations on the good life farm I'd

1181
00:49:49,489 --> 00:49:52,849
actually spend like ten minutes talking

1182
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:55,190
about new forest farm because the

1183
00:49:52,849 --> 00:49:56,960
challenge that he was facing was he's up

1184
00:49:55,190 --> 00:49:58,610
against how many years of corn and

1185
00:49:56,960 --> 00:50:01,670
soybean breeding right and he's trying

1186
00:49:58,610 --> 00:50:05,240
to breed food crops on his own dime not

1187
00:50:01,670 --> 00:50:08,480
supported by you know the government any

1188
00:50:05,239 --> 00:50:10,009
schools and somehow compete against that

1189
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:12,170
industry and that's like one of those

1190
00:50:10,010 --> 00:50:14,090
things is like so we were living at his

1191
00:50:12,170 --> 00:50:16,039
farm 15 years in so I'm telling you we

1192
00:50:14,090 --> 00:50:18,740
live in a shack they still don't have

1193
00:50:16,039 --> 00:50:20,659
half you know and he had two kids and so

1194
00:50:18,739 --> 00:50:23,199
I feel like that was like fairly

1195
00:50:20,659 --> 00:50:25,819
traumatizing for me actually it was like

1196
00:50:23,199 --> 00:50:28,039
like you guys seemed kind of unhappy

1197
00:50:25,820 --> 00:50:31,340
even though you're so inspired and

1198
00:50:28,039 --> 00:50:32,960
inspiring and now they're 25 years in

1199
00:50:31,340 --> 00:50:35,690
and they have dealt with some of those

1200
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:38,090
things but that farm is still like it's

1201
00:50:35,690 --> 00:50:40,010
basically a test concept in a lot of

1202
00:50:38,090 --> 00:50:40,400
ways and it's a really important one in

1203
00:50:40,010 --> 00:50:42,829
icing

1204
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:44,750
he's he's an elder in the permaculture

1205
00:50:42,829 --> 00:50:46,278
movement at this point mark Shepherd and

1206
00:50:44,750 --> 00:50:48,230
he wrote a really beautiful book that I

1207
00:50:46,278 --> 00:50:51,710
cannot remember the name of but I would

1208
00:50:48,230 --> 00:50:53,240
look it up and so it was like we came

1209
00:50:51,710 --> 00:50:56,659
away from that being like okay so the

1210
00:50:53,239 --> 00:50:59,058
idea is good and the implementation is

1211
00:50:56,659 --> 00:51:00,618
incredibly difficult we shouldn't be

1212
00:50:59,059 --> 00:51:02,690
doing any breeding we should be growing

1213
00:51:00,619 --> 00:51:04,039
agriculturally recognized crops so

1214
00:51:02,690 --> 00:51:05,389
that's how we ended up with the

1215
00:51:04,039 --> 00:51:08,240
perennial crop layout that we have

1216
00:51:05,389 --> 00:51:10,449
asparagus fruit crops I get much more

1217
00:51:08,239 --> 00:51:13,578
like those go to market in a really

1218
00:51:10,449 --> 00:51:19,009
straightforward way right even if they

1219
00:51:13,579 --> 00:51:20,210
go as cider but yeah I think I don't

1220
00:51:19,010 --> 00:51:22,880
know you made me feel like I should have

1221
00:51:20,210 --> 00:51:25,970
mentioned mark earlier thank you any

1222
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:29,500
other thoughts questions I'm totally

1223
00:51:25,969 --> 00:51:31,489
just like ping pong like random never

1224
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:35,750
should we see if there's any more slides

1225
00:51:31,489 --> 00:51:37,788
I missed mmm

1226
00:51:35,750 --> 00:51:42,349
yeah I think we're good yeah so this is

1227
00:51:37,789 --> 00:51:43,670
the this is the farm in 2013 these trees

1228
00:51:42,349 --> 00:51:46,220
are much bigger those are Asian pears

1229
00:51:43,670 --> 00:51:49,809
and this is again the inside of the

1230
00:51:46,219 --> 00:51:56,328
cider has a really strange font yeah

1231
00:51:49,809 --> 00:51:59,019
like I cut off the time we're done no

1232
00:51:56,329 --> 00:51:59,019
one has any questions

1233
00:52:00,769 --> 00:52:08,190
directly for the most part and I've had

1234
00:52:06,420 --> 00:52:09,599
so many big I've had a like a number of

1235
00:52:08,190 --> 00:52:12,599
big ideas that have truly failed

1236
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:14,219
actually and one of them was this

1237
00:52:12,599 --> 00:52:16,380
collaborative CSA that we were running

1238
00:52:14,219 --> 00:52:17,789
and we just it was the same idea as the

1239
00:52:16,380 --> 00:52:19,950
food we serve in the cider house which

1240
00:52:17,789 --> 00:52:22,500
was like someone could join our CSA and

1241
00:52:19,949 --> 00:52:24,419
get a full diet because I was working

1242
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:26,730
with all these other farms but we they

1243
00:52:24,420 --> 00:52:28,800
were such small producers we couldn't

1244
00:52:26,730 --> 00:52:30,780
get a low enough price to put our margin

1245
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:32,550
on it to run that so that was two years

1246
00:52:30,780 --> 00:52:34,890
of really big challenge and one of the

1247
00:52:32,550 --> 00:52:36,480
things that's generated for me was a

1248
00:52:34,889 --> 00:52:38,159
really incredible marketing list so

1249
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:39,990
between direct marketing turkeys which

1250
00:52:38,159 --> 00:52:43,739
was really easy for years and years and

1251
00:52:39,989 --> 00:52:47,129
running the CSA plus I fell like 400 or

1252
00:52:43,739 --> 00:52:49,679
500 of my pounds of ginger in one to ten

1253
00:52:47,130 --> 00:52:52,500
pound units directly to people and then

1254
00:52:49,679 --> 00:52:54,239
I mean we grow 3,000 pounds so the rest

1255
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:55,559
of it I wholesale and we buy a fair

1256
00:52:54,239 --> 00:52:57,239
amount of it and I'm not allowed to open

1257
00:52:55,559 --> 00:52:58,799
this like Cornell's all kinds of

1258
00:52:57,239 --> 00:52:59,879
regulations but I did bring this to

1259
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:02,970
share with you guys and this is our

1260
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:05,910
house-made soda we use about 300 pounds

1261
00:53:02,969 --> 00:53:07,709
of our own gender a year for this yeah

1262
00:53:05,909 --> 00:53:09,000
and then we make these shrubs but you

1263
00:53:07,710 --> 00:53:12,300
can also have these are for you

1264
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:15,719
is there to look at a shrub who

1265
00:53:12,300 --> 00:53:17,640
justifies you a shrub is a very old

1266
00:53:15,719 --> 00:53:20,789
drink actually and it's related to

1267
00:53:17,639 --> 00:53:23,699
sherbert so my understanding is that

1268
00:53:20,789 --> 00:53:25,440
it's it's you middle eastern and origin

1269
00:53:23,699 --> 00:53:27,539
and it's a way of preserving fruit and

1270
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:30,240
vegetables by macerating them in vinegar

1271
00:53:27,539 --> 00:53:32,309
and then straining like the the

1272
00:53:30,239 --> 00:53:35,669
particulate back out and using it as a

1273
00:53:32,309 --> 00:53:37,590
mixer and so it was very vinegary we

1274
00:53:35,670 --> 00:53:39,990
sell it as a cocktail and this is one of

1275
00:53:37,590 --> 00:53:41,640
the fun things about Governor Cuomo he's

1276
00:53:39,989 --> 00:53:43,169
been great for craft beverage and also

1277
00:53:41,639 --> 00:53:45,029
like a little confusing to it maybe

1278
00:53:43,170 --> 00:53:49,470
agree with me he's done this thing where

1279
00:53:45,030 --> 00:53:51,570
like any farm Blanc can serve any other

1280
00:53:49,469 --> 00:53:52,980
farm Blanc product so what you're going

1281
00:53:51,570 --> 00:53:56,850
to start seeing on the wine trails now

1282
00:53:52,980 --> 00:53:58,980
is like where am I like who made this

1283
00:53:56,849 --> 00:54:01,110
stuff you know that's how I feel about

1284
00:53:58,980 --> 00:54:03,869
it but at the same time we're going to

1285
00:54:01,110 --> 00:54:05,789
probably start selling vodka gin in the

1286
00:54:03,869 --> 00:54:08,150
shrubbery because we have a shrubbery

1287
00:54:05,789 --> 00:54:10,139
which is a cooler where we sell shrubs

1288
00:54:08,150 --> 00:54:11,309
and we probably are going to serve

1289
00:54:10,139 --> 00:54:13,239
cocktails because I don't want to go

1290
00:54:11,309 --> 00:54:15,369
there but it's mostly a really

1291
00:54:13,239 --> 00:54:18,089
cocktail mixer and a lot of people also

1292
00:54:15,369 --> 00:54:21,130
when they are quitting drinking buy it

1293
00:54:18,090 --> 00:54:22,210
so that they can have something fancy to

1294
00:54:21,130 --> 00:54:35,170
drink with their friends who are

1295
00:54:22,210 --> 00:54:37,570
drinking alcohol no no because this has

1296
00:54:35,170 --> 00:54:39,579
a CSA that we were doing a 100% our own

1297
00:54:37,570 --> 00:54:41,710
products with a spring CSA so March

1298
00:54:39,579 --> 00:54:45,670
April and May because we have all of

1299
00:54:41,710 --> 00:54:48,130
these tunnels like six of them and this

1300
00:54:45,670 --> 00:54:51,250
is what we produce but the thing was

1301
00:54:48,130 --> 00:54:54,000
that that even with that much of our own

1302
00:54:51,250 --> 00:54:56,440
production like there was still so much

1303
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:57,460
unpredictability in terms of what's

1304
00:54:56,440 --> 00:54:59,170
going to bolt and you're going to like

1305
00:54:57,460 --> 00:55:01,240
all this and have nothing for the CSA

1306
00:54:59,170 --> 00:55:02,710
this week which was always very

1307
00:55:01,239 --> 00:55:05,409
stressful and always happen at the end

1308
00:55:02,710 --> 00:55:06,400
of April and I was like why did I do

1309
00:55:05,409 --> 00:55:09,940
this

1310
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:12,099
like I was so dumb and so we just went

1311
00:55:09,940 --> 00:55:15,010
back to wholesaling our green super

1312
00:55:12,099 --> 00:55:18,400
straightforward but I think that the

1313
00:55:15,010 --> 00:55:19,810
thing about the CSA was like we would do

1314
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:22,450
you pick strawberries at the very end of

1315
00:55:19,809 --> 00:55:24,400
it people like loved coming to our farm

1316
00:55:22,449 --> 00:55:26,949
and that's a really important thing that

1317
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:29,710
I'm still trying to figure out how to

1318
00:55:26,949 --> 00:55:32,139
offer that and I think that the cider

1319
00:55:29,710 --> 00:55:32,619
house is a great a great vehicle for

1320
00:55:32,139 --> 00:55:35,710
that

1321
00:55:32,619 --> 00:55:37,329
and it can it can justify it in a way

1322
00:55:35,710 --> 00:55:39,190
that as a farmer just being a good host

1323
00:55:37,329 --> 00:55:42,608
can be very very difficult because

1324
00:55:39,190 --> 00:55:44,409
you're like I'm wasting my time like

1325
00:55:42,608 --> 00:55:46,090
literally right now you know whereas

1326
00:55:44,409 --> 00:55:48,819
it's a cider house like being a good

1327
00:55:46,090 --> 00:55:50,769
host is an imperative part of that of

1328
00:55:48,820 --> 00:55:51,369
that job and it's been a helpful shift

1329
00:55:50,769 --> 00:55:53,530
for me

1330
00:55:51,369 --> 00:55:56,050
so this vision I only did it once this

1331
00:55:53,530 --> 00:55:58,330
year I didn't we had a sight orchard

1332
00:55:56,050 --> 00:56:00,880
with sale in January where I was like

1333
00:55:58,329 --> 00:56:02,380
come whatever drink I don't care but I'm

1334
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:03,550
going to be out driving my horses in

1335
00:56:02,380 --> 00:56:05,769
circles and I'm going to give your kids

1336
00:56:03,550 --> 00:56:08,560
rides on my sled and it was so much fun

1337
00:56:05,769 --> 00:56:10,659
and it actually did turn into people

1338
00:56:08,559 --> 00:56:12,340
wanting to go in and drink in the cider

1339
00:56:10,659 --> 00:56:13,839
house and I think that's a nice place to

1340
00:56:12,340 --> 00:56:15,460
like back off and not try to exert

1341
00:56:13,840 --> 00:56:16,960
control which is kind of what we do at a

1342
00:56:15,460 --> 00:56:18,670
spare again is like you can come and

1343
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:20,500
spend no money and that's like totally

1344
00:56:18,670 --> 00:56:21,880
fine we want you to appreciate what

1345
00:56:20,500 --> 00:56:23,650
we're doing here and we want you have

1346
00:56:21,880 --> 00:56:25,280
fun and one should be safe so we're

1347
00:56:23,650 --> 00:56:28,490
going to control that

1348
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:31,640
and then what tends to happen is to like

1349
00:56:28,489 --> 00:56:34,369
I like this place and I think what you

1350
00:56:31,639 --> 00:56:36,589
do is special and sometimes I can afford

1351
00:56:34,369 --> 00:56:39,619
to spend money here sometimes not so

1352
00:56:36,590 --> 00:56:42,710
like yeah whereas if you're only selling

1353
00:56:39,619 --> 00:56:45,409
fetch in jur like you're only going to

1354
00:56:42,710 --> 00:56:48,710
ever get people who really really get

1355
00:56:45,409 --> 00:56:51,829
ginger which is a really small segment

1356
00:56:48,710 --> 00:56:57,679
hey a lot more people get alcohol turns

1357
00:56:51,829 --> 00:56:58,969
out so yeah any other questions feel

1358
00:56:57,679 --> 00:57:07,099
like you were trying to like get up and

1359
00:56:58,969 --> 00:57:08,899
stop me no questions no just like once

1360
00:57:07,099 --> 00:57:11,599

1361
00:57:08,900 --> 00:57:13,610
