1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,399
this is a production of cornell

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:04,399
university

3
00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:10,879
and so i'm really interested in how we

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,599
can aid

5
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:14,639
breeding efforts across a wide range of

6
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:17,679
crop species

7
00:00:14,638 --> 00:00:20,160
in order to combat malnutrition

8
00:00:17,679 --> 00:00:21,839
and really aid the ability to get a

9
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,800
wider variety of food sources in our

10
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:24,879
diets

11
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:27,199
and so one way that we can think of how

12
00:00:24,879 --> 00:00:29,118
to aid these breeding efforts is by

13
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:30,880
transferring knowledge and so the

14
00:00:29,118 --> 00:00:32,719
question is how can we

15
00:00:30,879 --> 00:00:34,719
transfer lessons learned from

16
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:37,200
well-studied species like maize

17
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:39,039
and arabidopsis and apply that knowledge

18
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,239
to a wide number of crops and orphan

19
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:42,878
crops

20
00:00:40,238 --> 00:00:44,558
and so one of the mechanisms that we can

21
00:00:42,878 --> 00:00:46,718
use to facilitate this net

22
00:00:44,558 --> 00:00:48,399
uh transfer of knowledge is by thinking

23
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:52,399
of mechanisms that are conserved

24
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:53,920
across long evolutionary time scales

25
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:55,840
and so one of the mechanisms that's

26
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:58,320
conserved across long evolutionary time

27
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:59,520
scales is transcription factor binding

28
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,520
and what i'm showing here is a very

29
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,640
simplistic tree but what i want you to

30
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,879
take away from it is

31
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,840
in red is what i'm showing the emergence

32
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:08,478
of

33
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:10,000
new transcription factor families and so

34
00:01:08,478 --> 00:01:11,599
there are a number of transcription

35
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,799
factor families that predate

36
00:01:11,599 --> 00:01:15,839
the origin of plants and also

37
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:17,840
there are a number of plant

38
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,520
transcription plant-specific

39
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,040
transcription factor families that

40
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:23,359
predate angiosperms

41
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,960
and so we expect a lot of their binding

42
00:01:23,359 --> 00:01:28,640
motifs to be conserved

43
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:28,640
in many of these plant species

44
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:32,560
and so this is the problem that a former

45
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:35,118
member of the lab catherine mejiaguera

46
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,960
explicitly tried to look at and so what

47
00:01:35,118 --> 00:01:39,599
she did was she trained

48
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:42,000
some sequence models on to predict

49
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:43,118
whether a tf is bound to a specific dna

50
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,040
sequence

51
00:01:43,118 --> 00:01:46,560
and when she looks at the motifs that

52
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,399
are learned by these models

53
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,399
and clusters them they follow the

54
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:52,239
expected phylogeny of the transcription

55
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:53,680
factor families that she sampled

56
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:55,438
so this suggests that the models are

57
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,280
really learning uh the biologically

58
00:01:55,438 --> 00:01:59,599
relevant motifs

59
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,320
and so what she did then was compared

60
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:02,798
the

61
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:05,758
learned motifs against the orthologs in

62
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:08,000
arabidopsis and saw that about 60

63
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:11,199
of these binding motifs are conserved

64
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,199
between the two species

65
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:15,919
and so what i wanted to do to follow up

66
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:17,640
on this was take catherine's model

67
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:19,598
architecture and train them in

68
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:23,199
arabidopsis-specific tf

69
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:24,560
and so i used i predicted in arabidopsis

70
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:25,359
and so what i want you to focus on here

71
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,120
is the area

72
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,720
the relative area under these curves

73
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,759
here and so the black line shows the

74
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:33,280
within species model performance

75
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:35,518
then when i take that same model and

76
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,000
attempt to predict an orthologous tf and

77
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:38,000
maize

78
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,598
i get a reduction in performance but

79
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,800
still above the baseline random

80
00:02:39,598 --> 00:02:44,238
classifier shown in

81
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,719
the gray dashed line the next when i

82
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:47,039
take

83
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:48,000
uh arabidopsis and maize sequence and

84
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:50,959
attempt to predict

85
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,639
tf binding in arabidopsis or maze i see

86
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:54,479
that this across species model does

87
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:55,119
almost as well as the within species

88
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:56,878
model

89
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,959
despite very different genomic contexts

90
00:02:56,878 --> 00:03:01,518
between these two species

91
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:03,598
now unfortunately transcription factor

92
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:06,400
binding especially chip

93
00:03:03,598 --> 00:03:07,679
expensive and complicated to assay and

94
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,360
so i was wondering if there was an

95
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,280
alternative way that we can really get

96
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,800
at this transcription factor binding

97
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:17,360
motif question

98
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:19,280
uh in a more easily accessible manner

99
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,879
and so we know that open chromatin

100
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,840
regions in the genome are really where

101
00:03:20,878 --> 00:03:24,079
these functional

102
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,360
uh transcription factor binding motifs

103
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,560
are concentrated

104
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,159
and so here i'm just showing a very

105
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,920
simple schematic of an open chromatin

106
00:03:28,158 --> 00:03:31,359
region flanked by the closed chromatin

107
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:34,079
wrapped around the histones and

108
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:35,440
various transcription factors bound in

109
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:38,480
different orientations

110
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:38,479
uh in the sequence

111
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:42,400
and so the question becomes can we

112
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:44,480
transfer

113
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,640
these open chromatin sequences across

114
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:48,560
angiosperms but also are they

115
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:50,639
even relevant for breeding purposes and

116
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,719
that's one of the questions that this

117
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:53,679
2016 study in may is attempted to

118
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:55,359
address

119
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,799
and so what they found is that open

120
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,879
chromatin regions

121
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:00,640
explain about 40 percent of the

122
00:03:58,878 --> 00:04:01,598
phenotypic variants in a number of

123
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:04,798
traits

124
00:04:01,598 --> 00:04:06,639
in two maize populations suggesting that

125
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:08,239
really these open chromatin regions do

126
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:10,958
help capture some of the non-genetic

127
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:10,959
functional space

128
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:15,199
and so the next question becomes can we

129
00:04:13,598 --> 00:04:17,039
well so i've shown that maize

130
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:18,879
and arabidopsis you can transfer

131
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,680
transcription factor binding between the

132
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:22,159
two

133
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,600
then can we also transfer chromatin

134
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,680
accessibility

135
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:29,600
and then the next question becomes what

136
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:30,800
kind of models would be used to do that

137
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,120
and so one of the models that i've

138
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:35,439
already introduced in a previous seminar

139
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:37,918
is convolutional neural networks and so

140
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:40,639
cnns are really well suited for this

141
00:04:37,918 --> 00:04:40,639
kind of

142
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,080
open chromatin prediction because

143
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:47,199
they're designed to

144
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:49,758
learn the spatial dependencies and

145
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:52,000
relationships between motifs or patterns

146
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:53,759
in a sequence and this is exactly like

147
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,839
we'd expect the transcription factor

148
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:58,160
binding motifs to be arranged in the

149
00:04:55,839 --> 00:05:00,319
open chromatin like i showed in the left

150
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:02,320
and so another important point here is

151
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:05,439
that not only do these

152
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:07,439
cnns learn the presence and absence

153
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:08,478
relationship between tfs and chromatin

154
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:10,719
accessibility

155
00:05:08,478 --> 00:05:12,240
but more importantly the co-presence and

156
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:15,039
the co-presence of maybe

157
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,319
larger tf modules because since tf

158
00:05:15,038 --> 00:05:18,159
binding sites are so short and

159
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:19,599
degenerate they tend to occur just by

160
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,880
chance throughout the genome and it's

161
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,639
really critical that

162
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:24,800
we can precisely identify these open

163
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:28,319
chromatin regions by their context

164
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,319
and not just single motifs

165
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:32,478
and so how i train this convolutional

166
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:35,519
neural network was using an excellent

167
00:05:32,478 --> 00:05:36,478
leaf ataxia data set from 13 angiosperm

168
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:38,319
species

169
00:05:36,478 --> 00:05:39,599
that was published last year by bob

170
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:40,800
schmidt's group over at the university

171
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,120
of georgia

172
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:45,280
and so what i did was i trained this cnn

173
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:48,160
in 26 different configurations

174
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:49,918
13 of which were within species model

175
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:53,039
where i took one species

176
00:05:49,918 --> 00:05:56,719
split the genomic regions into

177
00:05:53,038 --> 00:05:59,120
training and test sets and then

178
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:01,280
evaluated the model in the test set and

179
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,918
then i also trained 13 across species

180
00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:03,758
models

181
00:06:01,918 --> 00:06:05,038
where i took one test species of the

182
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:06,720
angiosperms

183
00:06:05,038 --> 00:06:08,240
trained in the genomic regions of the

184
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,520
other 12

185
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:12,079
and tried to predict chromatin

186
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:13,758
accessibility in the 13th species

187
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:16,159
so just a very quick overview of how the

188
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:18,080
data looks the atex c

189
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,520
causes basically a reed pile up in these

190
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:20,879
open chromatin regions

191
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:23,038
and you can run an algorithm that's

192
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:23,759
known as a peak collar to binarize that

193
00:06:23,038 --> 00:06:26,800
output

194
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:27,680
and denoise the open chromatin region

195
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,960
predictions

196
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,800
and then what you can do is then

197
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:32,318
randomly sample a group of closed

198
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:36,000
chromatin regions from

199
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:37,600
the genome so very quickly an example

200
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
for a specific sequence or

201
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:41,439
specific species let's say arabidopsis

202
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,879
the within species model very

203
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:44,240
straightforward you just split the

204
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:45,759
genomic regions and

205
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:48,079
train in the training set and then test

206
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:49,598
in your test set

207
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:51,359
and then the cross species model is

208
00:06:49,598 --> 00:06:52,399
let's say we're testing an arabidopsis

209
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,560
we would then train

210
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:58,159
in the other 12 species and attempt to

211
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:59,918
predict in arabidopsis like this

212
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,360
and so here is what the example

213
00:06:59,918 --> 00:07:03,038
performance would look like for the

214
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,400
arabidopsis within species in a

215
00:07:03,038 --> 00:07:06,478
cross-species model

216
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:09,198
we see the performances on the x-axis

217
00:07:06,478 --> 00:07:09,199
from zero to one

218
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:15,199
and so when i do the results across all

219
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:16,879
the angiosperm species i've sampled

220
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,720
we see that despite there being a

221
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:20,079
variability in performance across the

222
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:23,199
species they're all doing

223
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:25,198
much much better than a random baseline

224
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:27,360
classifier shown in the gray dash or the

225
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:30,080
black dash line

226
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,360
and then when we show the cross species

227
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:33,279
model performance

228
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:36,000
pretty much in every species we see that

229
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:38,000
the cross species model performance

230
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,120
is very equivalent to the within species

231
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,680
model performance

232
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:43,918
and what this suggests is that without

233
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:45,519
seeing any open chromatin data from a

234
00:07:43,918 --> 00:07:46,159
given species we are still able to

235
00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:48,719
utilize

236
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:50,639
angiosperm open chromatin data to

237
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,240
accurately and precisely predict

238
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:54,800
the open chromatin in that unobserved

239
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,800
species

240
00:07:55,439 --> 00:07:58,478
and so to dive a little deeper into

241
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,560
these results i want to show you two

242
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:01,839
precision recall plots from my cross

243
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,360
species models

244
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:04,878
so on the left we see arabidopsis

245
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,080
daliana as the test set and what i want

246
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:09,680
you to take away from this

247
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:11,038
is that essentially about 55 of my open

248
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,038
chromatin regions

249
00:08:11,038 --> 00:08:15,199
in arabidopsis the model is able to

250
00:08:13,038 --> 00:08:17,120
precisely predict them before it starts

251
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:19,439
to begin making mistakes

252
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:21,439
and so also in asparagus which the model

253
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:23,918
does relatively

254
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:25,918
worse on we're still able to predict

255
00:08:23,918 --> 00:08:27,038
about 20 percent of the open chromatin

256
00:08:25,918 --> 00:08:28,799
regions as open

257
00:08:27,038 --> 00:08:31,120
precisely before we start to make

258
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,080
mistakes and so what this suggests is

259
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,320
that there's a

260
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,200
seems to be a subset of open chromatin

261
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,039
regions

262
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,560
that we're really precisely able to

263
00:08:37,038 --> 00:08:39,519
identify and these might be a good

264
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,639
starting point

265
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:45,039
while we're still trying to figure out

266
00:08:40,639 --> 00:08:46,799
how to predict the the other percentages

267
00:08:45,039 --> 00:08:48,559
and one other interesting phenomenon

268
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:49,439
that we see in asparagus and a few other

269
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:52,079
species

270
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,760
is this rapid drop-off in precision so

271
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,959
essentially what this says is there is a

272
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:56,639
subset of open

273
00:08:54,958 --> 00:08:59,039
uh closed chromatin regions in the

274
00:08:56,639 --> 00:08:59,759
a-taxi that the model is highly

275
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:02,319
confidently

276
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:03,039
predicting as open which suggests to me

277
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:05,839
there may be

278
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:06,480
some uh maybe due to lower coverage and

279
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:09,120
the a-tac

280
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:10,399
seeks some truly open regions that were

281
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,519
marked as closed

282
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:14,000
and so this really gets at the whole

283
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:17,839
idea that your model can only be

284
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:20,080
evaluated as good as your test set is

285
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:21,760
and so in summary um shown a bit that

286
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:23,600
transcription factor binding can be

287
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:25,120
predicted across angiosperms

288
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,720
but is unfortunately expensive and

289
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,879
complicated the assay

290
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:30,399
and so the open chromatin also contains

291
00:09:28,879 --> 00:09:30,958
transcription factor binding sites and

292
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:34,080
therefore

293
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:37,039
overlap our non-genetic functional sites

294
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:38,560
and so therefore cnns can predict uh i

295
00:09:37,039 --> 00:09:40,319
show that cnns can predict chromatin

296
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:42,239
accessibility across long evolutionary

297
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,440
distances with high accuracy

298
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,839
and a couple more things i want to

299
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,959
follow up on is how well do these leaf

300
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:49,120
train models do

301
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:51,039
in other tissues as well as are these

302
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:52,799
predicted regions enriched in geowas

303
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:54,879
hits and other signals of regulatory

304
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:56,719
regions

305
00:09:54,879 --> 00:09:58,958
and so i'd like to finally acknowledge

306
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:00,720
my committee at buckler amy williams and

307
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:02,319
eric richards for their guidance

308
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,000
catherine mejiaguera who has been like

309
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:05,920
an unofficial fourth committee member

310
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,839
and has really been who i'm basing a lot

311
00:10:05,919 --> 00:10:09,278
of this work on them off of

312
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:10,959
as well as the buckler lab for their

313
00:10:09,278 --> 00:10:13,200
excellent discussions on this project

314
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:16,838
and of course my funding sources

315
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:19,839
i'd be happy to take any questions thank

316
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:19,839
you

317
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:24,639
thank you so much for that talk travis

318
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:27,679
uh lots of clap em emojis

319
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:30,480
um if anybody has any questions they can

320
00:10:27,679 --> 00:10:31,919
either add them oh i think mike gore has

321
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,680
some questions if you can see them in

322
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:37,039
the chat

323
00:10:33,679 --> 00:10:38,879
sure let me see is there a need to

324
00:10:37,039 --> 00:10:40,639
control for evolutionary relatedness

325
00:10:38,879 --> 00:10:41,759
from protecting across species or is

326
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:43,679
that what is leveraged

327
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:45,278
yeah that's a great question mike and uh

328
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:46,078
we talked about this in the lab a bit

329
00:10:45,278 --> 00:10:47,679
and

330
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:49,359
i'm really leaning towards the second

331
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:51,278
part of that question

332
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,639
there is revolutionary relationship

333
00:10:51,278 --> 00:10:55,200
between uh these

334
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:56,559
open chromatin regions um and it's

335
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,000
really a tough call because that's

336
00:10:56,559 --> 00:10:58,879
exactly what we're trying to expect to

337
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,120
leverage

338
00:10:58,879 --> 00:11:03,838
so the question becomes how can we make

339
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:06,000
sure these models are learning

340
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:06,959
for example transcription factor binding

341
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,919
rather than

342
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:11,599
a non-informative but evolutionary

343
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:13,919
related sequence

344
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,680
and then two are the shared open

345
00:11:13,919 --> 00:11:17,278
chromatin regions overlapping with

346
00:11:15,679 --> 00:11:18,799
conserved non-coding regions

347
00:11:17,278 --> 00:11:20,559
i haven't looked at this yet but that's

348
00:11:18,799 --> 00:11:22,879
a question i definitely want to follow

349
00:11:20,559 --> 00:11:22,879
up on

350
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:30,079
um travis just to follow on what what

351
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:31,838
mike was asking

352
00:11:30,078 --> 00:11:34,159
have you have you tried schemes like

353
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:35,839
where you if you're predicting a monocot

354
00:11:34,159 --> 00:11:36,799
you just use the monocots you don't

355
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:41,040
bother with the

356
00:11:36,799 --> 00:11:43,039
dicots yeah and and how does that impact

357
00:11:41,039 --> 00:11:44,719
performance yeah so that's an

358
00:11:43,039 --> 00:11:46,000
interesting question because i did do

359
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:49,360
that initially i haven't

360
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:51,519
i haven't shown the results here and

361
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,879
it does show essentially what you expect

362
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:55,039
in that

363
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:57,200
for most of the species performance

364
00:11:55,039 --> 00:11:59,519
decreases a bit

365
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,480
slightly when you go from a monocot

366
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:03,440
based model

367
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:04,399
to an angiosperm based model there's

368
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,880
some very

369
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:08,879
strange signal for some species like we

370
00:12:06,879 --> 00:12:10,879
saw poplar got very

371
00:12:08,879 --> 00:12:12,399
was very good with a die-cut model but

372
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:14,240
when you bring it out to the angiosperms

373
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:17,440
it does poorly so

374
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:18,959
i'd say generally performance lowers a

375
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:24,480
little bit but not

376
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:26,559
significantly or not very much

377
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:28,639
we have another question how to explain

378
00:12:26,559 --> 00:12:29,679
the lower performance in maize compared

379
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:31,440
to rice

380
00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:32,799
yeah i think i'll answer that question

381
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,800
by just sort of explaining

382
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:36,078
why i think there's some variability

383
00:12:34,799 --> 00:12:38,879
between species and

384
00:12:36,078 --> 00:12:41,120
ed sort of gets at that point a bit in

385
00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:43,919
that there is an uneven

386
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:44,959
uh depth of data between these species

387
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:46,399
and so

388
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:48,638
not only is the data quality a bit

389
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:50,159
variable between species and we can

390
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:52,000
see that by looking at the within

391
00:12:50,159 --> 00:12:55,360
species models are also performing

392
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:57,759
poorly so a combination of uneven

393
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,959
data quality across the species maybe

394
00:12:57,759 --> 00:13:02,319
some assembly

395
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:03,439
issues some possible tissue mismatching

396
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:06,879
so there are a number of things that

397
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:10,000
could go into that

398
00:13:06,879 --> 00:13:11,519
i think that wraps up our time but we

399
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,600
can give a final

400
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:14,879
round of applause to all of our speakers

401
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,040
