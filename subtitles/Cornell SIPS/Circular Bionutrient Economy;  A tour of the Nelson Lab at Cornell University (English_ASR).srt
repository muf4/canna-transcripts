00:00:02,638 --> 00:00:07,119
Welcome to our lab tour thanks so much

3
00:00:04,679 --> 00:00:08,638
for joining so I'm sitting here in my

4
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:11,199
office in the plant science building at

5
00:00:08,638 --> 00:00:14,320
Cornell University opposite Mr Jensen

6
00:00:11,199 --> 00:00:16,679
and jagy our brilliant and accomplished

7
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:20,278
filmmaker here and he's going to take us

8
00:00:16,679 --> 00:00:23,039
on a whirlwind kaleidoscopic tour of our

9
00:00:20,278 --> 00:00:25,079
facilities so it's nice to be here and

10
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:27,240
I'm just going to mention now a few of

11
00:00:25,079 --> 00:00:29,198
the sites that Jensen who's a member of

12
00:00:27,239 --> 00:00:30,959
our lab is going to take you on so

13
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:32,880
Jensen's going to show but a few scenes

14
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,480
and a few other people from the lab will

15
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:38,200
make appearances in some of these

16
00:00:34,479 --> 00:00:40,319
different places so um so here in plant

17
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:42,520
science I hope you're going to see a

18
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:46,840
couple of our PE collection points at

19
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:49,359
Cornell and you're also going to see our

20
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:51,199
laboratory u in a different building

21
00:00:49,359 --> 00:00:53,640
you're going to also see our kind of wet

22
00:00:51,198 --> 00:00:56,079
lab where we do our pee work we have a

23
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:58,679
pasteurizer from the rich rich Earth

24
00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:00,000
Institute there we have our IC tanks and

25
00:00:58,679 --> 00:01:02,799
it's right near our Greenhouse so

26
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,879
connects with our um setup and Analysis

27
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:08,679
work and uh our green Greenhouse work

28
00:01:05,879 --> 00:01:10,478
there um you'll also be visiting dilman

29
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:12,240
Hill student organic farm where some of

30
00:01:10,478 --> 00:01:14,679
our experiments take place in the high

31
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:17,478
tunnel and out in the on the Saxon racks

32
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:19,280
and see our little garden there and then

33
00:01:17,478 --> 00:01:21,640
we'll also be making a quick visit to

34
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:24,280
the soil Factory where we have Community

35
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:27,239
engagement and even a few scenes from

36
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:28,840
our work in Kenya so just real quick to

37
00:01:27,239 --> 00:01:30,478
acknowledge a couple of our

38
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:33,840
collaborators

39
00:01:30,478 --> 00:01:35,759
um Professor Johannes Layon is a biochar

40
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,640
expert who's a key conspirator for some

41
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:39,959
of our resource recovery work with

42
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:43,159
involving biochars he's involved in our

43
00:01:39,959 --> 00:01:45,718
project on um also on PE powered

44
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:48,320
composting and grow as you go gardening

45
00:01:45,718 --> 00:01:51,078
also in East Africa where our lead

46
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:54,158
collaborator is professor Charles Mida

47
00:01:51,078 --> 00:01:58,718
another world famous uh he's a biologist

48
00:01:54,159 --> 00:02:01,359
uh entomologist a public health guy and

49
00:01:58,718 --> 00:02:04,158
all around circular om IST so anyway

50
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:06,159
just want to want to uh TI my hat to

51
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:08,840
them and many other collaborators who

52
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:12,319
are involved in our work thanks the P

53
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:15,360
cycling that we're involved with is

54
00:02:12,318 --> 00:02:17,878
entirely container based sanitation so

55
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:20,800
all the urine collected from all the

56
00:02:17,878 --> 00:02:25,039
sites and all the collection schemes is

57
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:27,400
collected in containers that transported

58
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:31,239
Dr Nelson transports the

59
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:36,080
containers um to this site here you have

60
00:02:31,239 --> 00:02:40,560
a tank just outside this window that um

61
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:42,920
uh receive y from various places we

62
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:46,000
collect it dump it in there and it's

63
00:02:42,919 --> 00:02:48,479
pumped into the pasteurizer from the

64
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,840
rich Earth Institute and return to

65
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:54,119
another tank which we then we can draw

66
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:54,120
down and and use in

67
00:02:54,878 --> 00:03:01,079
experiments as with any area of

68
00:02:58,158 --> 00:03:03,199
agricultural innovation you know we have

69
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:06,159
a lot to benefit from working with

70
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:07,679
Partners who are engaged in uh either

71
00:03:06,158 --> 00:03:10,199
exploring the same questions but a

72
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:12,280
different contexts or exploring

73
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:15,598
different but related questions and so

74
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:19,120
the Nelson lab collaborates with many

75
00:03:15,598 --> 00:03:20,158
many collaborators on Cornell's campus

76
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,799
uh

77
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:25,679
Cornell's uh the university slogan is

78
00:03:22,799 --> 00:03:27,879
any person any study so there there are

79
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:30,560
people across the university pursuing

80
00:03:27,878 --> 00:03:33,598
different areas of of study but who have

81
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:36,479
who share an interest in in circularity

82
00:03:33,598 --> 00:03:38,839
and so there are collaborators all

83
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:41,238
across campus in other disciplines

84
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:44,319
within the school of Agriculture and

85
00:03:41,239 --> 00:03:46,239
outside that school um that we who we

86
00:03:44,318 --> 00:03:48,878
collaborate with on campus one of our

87
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:52,560
most important collaborators is the

88
00:03:48,878 --> 00:03:56,719
student Farm Cornell has a network

89
00:03:52,560 --> 00:04:00,239
of agricultural experiment stations uh

90
00:03:56,719 --> 00:04:02,400
Farms where researchers host research

91
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:04,000
host extension

92
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:07,079
activities

93
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,000
um and one of the sites closest to

94
00:04:07,079 --> 00:04:12,000
Cornell's academic campus is the student

95
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,199
Farm which is right on right on campus

96
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:18,079
and it's

97
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:21,199
a it's a site that hosts student Le

98
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:23,879
research including students you see in

99
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:25,639
this video here who lead research

100
00:04:23,879 --> 00:04:27,399
projects with the Nelson landb based at

101
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:29,120
the student farm and this summer I've

102
00:04:27,399 --> 00:04:30,918
been working here on the dman hill

103
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:33,360
student organic farm and also a bit

104
00:04:30,918 --> 00:04:36,319
inside the lab uh where we're taking a

105
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:38,879
look at how our uh organic underutilized

106
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:41,000
resource substrate and a variety of

107
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:43,399
alternative organic fertilizers such as

108
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,399
urine and fish effluent are affecting

109
00:04:43,399 --> 00:04:47,758
the health and growth of two culturally

110
00:04:45,399 --> 00:04:51,120
significant indigenous crops which are

111
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:54,680
honani skunk beans and Cherokee tobacco

112
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:56,840
it also is a place where students um can

113
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:58,759
work as Farm managers and be hired into

114
00:04:56,839 --> 00:05:01,560
that role when they learn how to manage

115
00:04:58,759 --> 00:05:04,160
a farm and they also lead a number of

116
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:07,038
community engagement initiatives that

117
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:09,800
bring uh really substantial amounts of

118
00:05:07,038 --> 00:05:13,038
of the student body onto the farm to

119
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:16,600
engage uh and the P cycling efforts that

120
00:05:13,038 --> 00:05:20,000
the Nelson lab leads there at the PE

121
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:22,840
collection the the EOL the

122
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,240
collecting toilet as well as our

123
00:05:22,839 --> 00:05:27,560
experiments in the high tunnel there are

124
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:29,879
featured really really prominently and

125
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:32,639
students are exposed to that through

126
00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:34,800
that facility we are studying different

127
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:37,360
aspects of the circular bionutrient

128
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:40,120
economy and as you can see we're up at

129
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:43,100
dilman Hill student organic farm in our

130
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:46,280
high tunnel working with some

131
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:48,639
[Music]

132
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:51,119
Tomatoes we're also interested in

133
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:53,960
looking at alternatives to Conventional

134
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:56,038
nitrogen fertilizers so in this case

135
00:05:53,959 --> 00:05:58,918
we've grown some of our tomatoes with

136
00:05:56,038 --> 00:06:00,560
Miracle Row a standard fertilizer used

137
00:05:58,918 --> 00:06:03,478
by many gardeners

138
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:05,519
uh but we've also grown some plants with

139
00:06:03,478 --> 00:06:08,318
pasteurized human

140
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:10,680
urine and we're here at dman Hill

141
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:15,160
student organic farm at the pollinator

142
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:18,319
Garden that is a pea powered pollinator

143
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:20,199
Garden beautiful bees all around me with

144
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:22,879
these beautiful flowers that are growing

145
00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:22,879
because of

146
00:06:23,319 --> 00:06:30,319
pea also in this vicinity

147
00:06:27,598 --> 00:06:33,399
is uh an

148
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:36,039
indigenous research project using

149
00:06:33,399 --> 00:06:38,638
culturally relevant crops that are also

150
00:06:36,038 --> 00:06:39,800
fertilized with PE as well as black

151
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:42,038
solder fly

152
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:44,079
frass and comparing that against

153
00:06:42,038 --> 00:06:47,159
conventional Miracle Grow where we made

154
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:50,000
this P indigenous panamerican Garden as

155
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:53,240
a model for marginalized areas where

156
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:56,240
their soils may be contaminated or

157
00:06:53,240 --> 00:07:00,680
depleted by nutrients from synthetic

158
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:00,680
fertilizer and pesticide abuse

159
00:07:00,759 --> 00:07:04,840
so the soil Factory is an off-campus

160
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:07,720
site with a big warehouse and a lot of

161
00:07:04,839 --> 00:07:12,038
space and an artist residency so that's

162
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:14,479
where um a group of us uh key

163
00:07:12,038 --> 00:07:18,639
coconspirator again being johanes Layman

164
00:07:14,478 --> 00:07:20,719
and um many others uh we have uh art

165
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:25,199
science events where artists come visit

166
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:27,800
and put on shows we have PE cycling uh

167
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:29,520
toilets being invented there and we have

168
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:31,439
a big grow as you go Garden where we're

169
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:33,758
doing PE powered composting and

170
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:35,478
gardening um and when people come from

171
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:37,759
abroad for instance I also mentioned

172
00:07:35,478 --> 00:07:40,360
Charles midega when he and other people

173
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:42,120
come to talk about whatever um circular

174
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:44,520
economy topic you know they they'd

175
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:47,199
always have a a community event there

176
00:07:44,519 --> 00:07:49,198
with a dinner and people an informal uh

177
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:51,199
exposure to the community and exchanging

178
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:53,158
ideas with people from around here so

179
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:55,478
it's a it's a nice place for all sorts

180
00:07:53,158 --> 00:07:59,478
of exchange of information and um P

181
00:07:55,478 --> 00:07:59,478
cycling gets a whole lot of press

182
00:08:01,158 --> 00:08:07,149
welcome to the Rebecca Nelson

183
00:08:04,009 --> 00:08:07,149
[Music]

184
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:15,519
lab I'll guide you through our lab

185
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:17,918
facilities and showcase some key areas

186
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:19,598
and equipment that support our research

187
00:08:17,918 --> 00:08:21,598
activities I'll start with the

188
00:08:19,598 --> 00:08:23,240
workbenches where we conduct most of our

189
00:08:21,598 --> 00:08:25,598
Hands-On

190
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:28,240
experiments each bench is equipped with

191
00:08:25,598 --> 00:08:30,319
standard tools and equipment such as

192
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:32,560
microscopes for obser

193
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:34,360
microorganisms pH and conductivity

194
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:37,038
meters for monitoring the ph and

195
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:38,639
solinity of samples as well as the

196
00:08:37,038 --> 00:08:40,439
sentug for separating different

197
00:08:38,639 --> 00:08:43,080
components of

198
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:46,040
samples above the workbenches are

199
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:48,600
shelves with mostly region glassware and

200
00:08:46,039 --> 00:08:51,278
items we use for chemical and biological

201
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:53,080
analysis we also have refrigerators and

202
00:08:51,278 --> 00:08:54,278
freezers that we use for storing and

203
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:56,839
preserving

204
00:08:54,278 --> 00:08:58,720
samples there's also a fume hood and

205
00:08:56,839 --> 00:09:03,079
bios safety cabinet that we use for

206
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:03,079
experiments that that involve volatile

207
00:09:03,879 --> 00:09:08,559
chemicals in the agricultural College we

208
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:12,200
collaborate with johannas Layman and his

209
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:14,199
research group on the uses of biochar in

210
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:16,920
these systems and and and other

211
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:20,440
questions I as well

212
00:09:16,919 --> 00:09:22,599
internationally um Dr Nelson Has

213
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:25,519
colleagues around the world but

214
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:28,040
especially in Kenya uh is our closest

215
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:30,399
collaborator Dr Charles Mida at poverty

216
00:09:28,039 --> 00:09:32,439
and Health Integrated Solutions

217
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:35,399
uh where he focuses

218
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:38,480
on different uses for urine and

219
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:41,200
agriculture there especially targeting

220
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:42,920
the per Urban and

221
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:46,440
urban uh

222
00:09:42,919 --> 00:09:48,639
applications uses of urine with biochar

223
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:51,079
and is really intimately engaged with a

224
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:54,039
number of community- based organizations

225
00:09:51,078 --> 00:09:56,599
there uh both for the P cycing side of

226
00:09:54,039 --> 00:10:01,199
the work and for the community

227
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:04,399
engagement and extension aspect

228
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:07,879
in addition to all the facilities that

229
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:11,720
facilitate our ability to study uh the

230
00:10:07,879 --> 00:10:13,679
use of urine as fertilizer and to um

231
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:15,079
provide nutrients in in these novel

232
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:19,000
Horticultural

233
00:10:15,078 --> 00:10:22,519
media um really the secret sauce to our

234
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:25,240
our work and and how we uh can study

235
00:10:22,519 --> 00:10:28,399
what we study here is not the facilities

236
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:31,959
but the the colleagues we have so um all

237
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:36,320
of my team teammates that and the team

238
00:10:31,958 --> 00:10:38,119
that Rebecca that Dr Nelson leads uh I

239
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:41,519
know we we all feel really lucky to work

240
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:43,159
with each other and and uh that that is

241
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:46,639
is really what what the Nelson lab

242
00:10:43,159 --> 00:10:46,639
brings to the table
