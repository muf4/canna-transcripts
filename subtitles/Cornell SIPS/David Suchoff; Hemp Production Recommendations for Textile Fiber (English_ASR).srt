Argentina so I this is just a really

72
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:07,239
really uh wonderful webinar series that

73
00:03:04,799 --> 00:03:08,959
you all host so uh as Bia mentioned my

74
00:03:07,239 --> 00:03:10,360
name is David suchoff I'm a faculty

75
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:15,878
member here in the department of crop

76
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:17,799
and soil Sciences at NC State and um my

77
00:03:15,878 --> 00:03:20,318
position as as mentioned is alternative

78
00:03:17,799 --> 00:03:22,920
crops extension specialist and so what I

79
00:03:20,318 --> 00:03:24,238
wanted to do today is to first kind of

80
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:27,958
discuss what that means what does my

81
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:29,480
position mean why do we do what we do um

82
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:32,199
and then we're going to delve a little

83
00:03:29,479 --> 00:03:34,399
bit into North Carolina agriculture uh

84
00:03:32,199 --> 00:03:37,079
and then really spend the majority of

85
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,920
our time talking about fiber him and

86
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:40,519
I'll admit that the title of the talk is

87
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:42,238
somewhat misleading the title is

88
00:03:40,519 --> 00:03:45,080
production recommendations for textile

89
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:48,080
fiber um and it's misleading because we

90
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:51,159
are still very much learning what those

91
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:52,560
recommendations are um and so a lot of

92
00:03:51,158 --> 00:03:54,560
the research that we're doing with fiber

93
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,199
hemp is actually quite new many of the

94
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,400
trials that we've initiated that I'll be

95
00:03:56,199 --> 00:04:01,000
talking about today started this past

96
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:03,120
summer so so uh any of the data that

97
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,959
I'll be sharing is very much preliminary

98
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,759
um it's giving us a better idea in terms

99
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:09,039
of how we need to move when it comes to

100
00:04:06,759 --> 00:04:10,518
to production recommendations but um

101
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:12,239
just know that a lot of this is very

102
00:04:10,519 --> 00:04:13,959
much preliminary uh and we're looking

103
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:16,439
forward to kind of continuing on with

104
00:04:13,959 --> 00:04:19,600
this work and expanding uh further so

105
00:04:16,439 --> 00:04:23,160
let me go ahead and share my

106
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:28,720
screen okay can you all see

107
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:31,039
that I'm assume you can um yes thank you

108
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,400
so um let's first talk a little bit

109
00:04:31,038 --> 00:04:34,918
about North Carolina for those of you

110
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:37,719
that may not know much about the state

111
00:04:34,918 --> 00:04:39,918
um agriculture is big in North Carolina

112
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:42,800
um it is our number one industry in

113
00:04:39,918 --> 00:04:45,639
terms of um economics this past year in

114
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:47,560
2023 we received just a little over

115
00:04:45,639 --> 00:04:49,720
hundred billion do in sales of all these

116
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:50,918
different uh agricultural goods and this

117
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:52,880
was the first time that we broke a

118
00:04:50,918 --> 00:04:55,000
hundred billion dollar so not only is it

119
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:58,560
a large industry but it is still a very

120
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,560
uh important uh and um ever growing

121
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:03,280
industry the other interesting fact

122
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:05,759
about North Carolina is that um our

123
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:08,000
agriculture sector is the third most

124
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:11,479
diverse in the nation we are only behind

125
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,199
California and Florida which I think is

126
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:15,839
um pretty impressive given the size of

127
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:17,600
our state compared to uh Florida and

128
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:19,399
California now a lot of this has to do

129
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,360
with the fact that even though we're

130
00:05:19,399 --> 00:05:23,079
relatively small we're quite long and

131
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,560
we've got a a lot of different

132
00:05:23,079 --> 00:05:25,959
geographies ranging from the coast all

133
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,680
the way to the mountains so we've got

134
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:30,000
different soil types different climates

135
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:32,600
different microclimates and so on

136
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,918
um now even though this is a very

137
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:36,600
diverse agricultural system there are

138
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:38,758
certain crops that have been more

139
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:40,960
important economically speaking than

140
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:42,840
others uh and one in particular is

141
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:44,599
tobacco um if you don't know North

142
00:05:42,839 --> 00:05:47,000
Carolina and agriculture know that

143
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:49,160
tobacco built this state and it still is

144
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,399
an important crop in our state um though

145
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:53,639
as you all probably guessed tobacco

146
00:05:51,399 --> 00:05:55,959
acdes down right consumption of tobacco

147
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:58,240
is down globally and so ACD is going

148
00:05:55,959 --> 00:06:00,680
down with it uh and so unfortunately

149
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,519
what we're seeing is many of the

150
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:04,600
counties or regions in our state where

151
00:06:02,519 --> 00:06:07,680
tobacco has been prominent and really

152
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:09,639
did build up those communities are going

153
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:12,199
through a lot of economic hardship and

154
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:14,800
depression and they're having challenges

155
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:16,680
finding some alternative crop to be

156
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,520
either a full or partial replacement for

157
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:20,759
tobacco and so that's where my position

158
00:06:18,519 --> 00:06:22,198
comes in my position is a new one in the

159
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:25,038
college that was developed about five

160
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:27,400
years ago and it was created

161
00:06:25,038 --> 00:06:29,519
specifically to look at new emerging

162
00:06:27,399 --> 00:06:30,959
crops that can fit in a traditional

163
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:32,399
tobacco system as either a full or

164
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:34,598
partial replacement for Farmers that are

165
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:36,638
either already out of tobacco or are

166
00:06:34,598 --> 00:06:39,360
starting to kind of you know make their

167
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:40,759
way out of that production system and so

168
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,720
I guess the first question is well what

169
00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:45,038
are the crops do they grow um now the

170
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:47,440
majority of tobacco production occurs in

171
00:06:45,038 --> 00:06:50,038
the eastern part of the state and if you

172
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:52,360
look basically these are traditional row

173
00:06:50,038 --> 00:06:53,639
cropping systems meaning there's corn

174
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:55,598
production there's soy production and

175
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:58,319
there's wheat production and tobacco is

176
00:06:55,598 --> 00:07:00,399
fitting in uh that rotation and so when

177
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:01,919
we're looking at alternative crops we

178
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:05,399
really want to be looking at crops that

179
00:07:01,918 --> 00:07:08,038
can also fit Within These systems um so

180
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:09,839
something that is going to leverage the

181
00:07:08,038 --> 00:07:12,560
same type of equipment or infrastructure

182
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:14,839
that is shared among these uh systems uh

183
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:16,240
and so um when we are thinking about new

184
00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:20,159
crops we really need to keep that in

185
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:22,319
mind now um taken together when when

186
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:24,080
we're talking about our program we look

187
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:25,479
at a number of different crops so be had

188
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:28,159
mentioned we look at hemp we've been

189
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:29,959
working at on hemp since I first started

190
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:31,840
admittedly when when I first started

191
00:07:29,959 --> 00:07:33,439
most of our work was in canabo or floral

192
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:36,359
hemp because that's where the industry

193
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:38,120
was um but that was somewhat of a bubble

194
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:40,199
that burst and we're seeing a huge shift

195
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:42,519
towards fiber and so we are moving with

196
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:44,759
that uh shift as well but we also work

197
00:07:42,519 --> 00:07:48,079
with with sunflowers as beia mentioned

198
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:51,080
um we're working a lot with Sesame um

199
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:52,839
flax and a few other crops and there's

200
00:07:51,079 --> 00:07:56,399
kind of Three core aspects of our

201
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:58,000
program the first is agronomics I am am

202
00:07:56,399 --> 00:07:59,519
an agronomist by training and so that's

203
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,720
the type of work that we're doing we

204
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:04,198
want to understand a if we can even grow

205
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:05,520
the crop here and then B what is it that

206
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:06,840
we need to do from a production

207
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:08,719
standpoint to ensure that we are

208
00:08:06,839 --> 00:08:11,359
producing that crop at the highest

209
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,919
standard we also focus on sustainability

210
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:15,319
and we really do try to focus on the

211
00:08:12,918 --> 00:08:17,439
three tenants of sustainability that is

212
00:08:15,319 --> 00:08:19,598
economic viability environmental

213
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:20,759
sustainability and then social equity

214
00:08:19,598 --> 00:08:22,158
and when we're looking at these new

215
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:24,319
crops we really want to make sure that

216
00:08:22,158 --> 00:08:26,279
we're looking at all three of those and

217
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:29,000
then the last one is this concept of

218
00:08:26,279 --> 00:08:31,239
quality um one of the things that has

219
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,278
made made tobacco so special for our

220
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:35,399
state is that we are able to produce a

221
00:08:33,278 --> 00:08:37,439
very specific type of highquality

222
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:39,479
tobacco which is often referred to as

223
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:41,719
you know the Golden Leaf the flu cured

224
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:42,839
Golden Leaf Tobacco of North Carolina

225
00:08:41,719 --> 00:08:45,080
and why that's important and the reason

226
00:08:42,839 --> 00:08:46,959
why I bring that up is that it is a

227
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:50,120
product that is recognized across the

228
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:52,239
globe and it generates higher profit

229
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:54,039
margins and so when we are looking at

230
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,320
these new and emerging crops we want to

231
00:08:54,039 --> 00:08:58,039
make sure that we are taking that

232
00:08:55,320 --> 00:09:00,079
mindset that is I want folks in a

233
00:08:58,039 --> 00:09:02,399
different part of the world to know that

234
00:09:00,078 --> 00:09:04,039
okay sesame from North Carolina or Fiber

235
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:05,120
hemp from North Carolina is of high

236
00:09:04,039 --> 00:09:06,879
quality because that means that our

237
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,399
farmers can uh Garner the highest

238
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:10,278
profits now we're going to talk a little

239
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:12,639
bit about quality and fiber hemp and the

240
00:09:10,278 --> 00:09:14,120
challenges that we've had in terms of um

241
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:16,838
what that actually means but but we'll

242
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:18,919
get to that in in a little bit now as I

243
00:09:16,839 --> 00:09:21,160
mentioned we saw this big boom and bust

244
00:09:18,919 --> 00:09:23,479
around floral hemp and a big shift

245
00:09:21,159 --> 00:09:26,199
towards fiber hemp um and what's

246
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:28,278
exciting for North Carolina is that it's

247
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:29,560
not just farmer interest in fiber but

248
00:09:28,278 --> 00:09:32,519
we're seeing a lot of interest from

249
00:09:29,559 --> 00:09:34,799
processors uh and use manufacturers and

250
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:36,360
so this brings me to the next important

251
00:09:34,799 --> 00:09:38,838
aspect of our state to know and that is

252
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:41,440
that textiles is still also a very

253
00:09:38,839 --> 00:09:43,600
important uh industry in our city now

254
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:46,079
admittedly this industry is not what it

255
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,800
was you know 20 years ago a 100 years

256
00:09:46,078 --> 00:09:49,879
ago there's been a tremendous amount of

257
00:09:47,799 --> 00:09:51,679
offshoring of textiles but it still

258
00:09:49,879 --> 00:09:53,000
generates quite a lot of money as you

259
00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:56,078
could see close to one and a half

260
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:58,120
billion dollars in 2023 we have almost

261
00:09:56,078 --> 00:09:59,919
400 textile manufacturers in our state

262
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:03,159
and these range from you know mom and

263
00:09:59,919 --> 00:10:05,599
pop very small scale handmade products

264
00:10:03,159 --> 00:10:08,078
to very very large processors like you

265
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:11,120
see in the photo here uh and large

266
00:10:08,078 --> 00:10:12,919
apparel Brands um and what's also really

267
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:15,679
important to note is that our state

268
00:10:12,919 --> 00:10:18,319
produces about 20% of the nation's

269
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:19,679
export of textille so yes the industry

270
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:22,600
is not what it used to be but it still

271
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:25,719
is a very very important industry to the

272
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:28,278
state and this industry is particularly

273
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:30,079
interested in fiber and when I talk to

274
00:10:28,278 --> 00:10:31,919
these folks whether it is apparel

275
00:10:30,078 --> 00:10:33,399
companies that want to integrate fiber

276
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:35,240
hemp into some of their apparel lines or

277
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:36,839
if it's non-woven companies they want to

278
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:38,839
include it into some of their non-woven

279
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:40,880
products they are really excited about

280
00:10:38,839 --> 00:10:42,800
fiber hemp and it's not just simply the

281
00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:45,240
novelty of saying you know this shirt

282
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:47,719
contains hemp but there are actual

283
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:50,480
benefits to the Garment or to the non-

284
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:52,519
moven product that that fiber from fiber

285
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,759
hemp affords them and so they're really

286
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:55,320
excited about that and they're also

287
00:10:53,759 --> 00:10:57,600
really excited about the the

288
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:58,839
sustainability story that's associated

289
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,600
with fiber Hamp and we can certainly

290
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:04,480
spend spend some time talking about that

291
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:06,000
a bit later on so I I'm going to go over

292
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:07,480
some Basics and I apologize because I'm

293
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,078
sure there are plenty of people on this

294
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:10,399
this call that know this information but

295
00:11:09,078 --> 00:11:12,039
it's going to be important if you don't

296
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:13,720
know it that you do because we're going

297
00:11:12,039 --> 00:11:14,799
to talk about this later on but when

298
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:16,278
we're talking about fiber hemp

299
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:18,359
production we're really talking about

300
00:11:16,278 --> 00:11:20,600
stem farming right all we're after is

301
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:22,120
producing nice long thin stems the

302
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:24,560
reason for that is that's where the

303
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:27,039
fibers are located and the fibers are

304
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:30,159
located in the bast in particular so the

305
00:11:27,039 --> 00:11:32,199
bast is uh basically the Ark of the stem

306
00:11:30,159 --> 00:11:33,879
and that's where these very very long

307
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:35,680
very strong cellulosic fibers are

308
00:11:33,879 --> 00:11:38,120
located that we can use for clothing or

309
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:40,319
yarn or non-woven materials and so on

310
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:42,759
and so forth there's also the herd right

311
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:44,040
which is that inner Woody core and you

312
00:11:42,759 --> 00:11:45,639
know historically it's been used for

313
00:11:44,039 --> 00:11:47,639
animal bedding but we're seeing a lot of

314
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:49,639
really really interesting Innovations

315
00:11:47,639 --> 00:11:52,039
around hempcrete or or other

316
00:11:49,639 --> 00:11:53,839
applications of herd in fact the herd

317
00:11:52,039 --> 00:11:55,439
Market in the US is growing much faster

318
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:56,920
than the bast Market is and there's a

319
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:59,800
number of reasons

320
00:11:56,919 --> 00:12:01,799
why but when we talk talk about textile

321
00:11:59,799 --> 00:12:02,759
application it's also important to

322
00:12:01,799 --> 00:12:04,958
understand that there are a number of

323
00:12:02,759 --> 00:12:06,600
processes that are required to go from

324
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:08,799
harvesting in the field to something

325
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:10,879
that can then be spun or woven or

326
00:12:08,799 --> 00:12:13,078
incorporated into you know name your

327
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:14,759
garment or name your non-woven product

328
00:12:13,078 --> 00:12:16,278
and so we're going to cut our crop and

329
00:12:14,759 --> 00:12:17,639
we're going to let it R and so during

330
00:12:16,278 --> 00:12:20,679
that rting process we're leaving it in

331
00:12:17,639 --> 00:12:22,440
the field and during that time period as

332
00:12:20,679 --> 00:12:24,078
long as the environment is correct

333
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:26,079
microbes are going to be breaking down

334
00:12:24,078 --> 00:12:28,239
the pectin that binds together the bast

335
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:30,838
and herd which is critical for our next

336
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:33,039
step which is decortication so after

337
00:12:30,839 --> 00:12:35,000
it's readed we take that stem material

338
00:12:33,039 --> 00:12:37,679
out of the field to a decorticator and

339
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:40,759
all a decorticator is is just a set of

340
00:12:37,679 --> 00:12:43,198
it's most basic a set of rolling uh

341
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:45,799
gears that crush the stems and if the

342
00:12:43,198 --> 00:12:48,078
stems are properly readed the herd will

343
00:12:45,799 --> 00:12:49,879
separate from the bast so we've got a

344
00:12:48,078 --> 00:12:52,599
pile of herd and we've got a pile of

345
00:12:49,879 --> 00:12:55,958
Bast once it's decorticated we then take

346
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:58,000
that Bast to our next and final step

347
00:12:55,958 --> 00:12:59,719
which is De guming and D guming is just

348
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,720
pulping so we're going to take that Bast

349
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:04,240
we're going to put it in a big bath

350
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:07,240
that's going to be water maybe sodium

351
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:09,000
hydroxide maybe uh hydrogen peroxide

352
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:10,519
maybe some other products and what we're

353
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,919
we're going to add heat and pressure and

354
00:13:10,519 --> 00:13:14,278
we're cooking it so that we can more or

355
00:13:11,919 --> 00:13:16,559
less wash away the impurities mainly

356
00:13:14,278 --> 00:13:17,600
ligan and hemicellulose so there's other

357
00:13:16,559 --> 00:13:19,319
stuff in there that we're trying to get

358
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:21,720
rid of so that when we are done with de

359
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:24,000
guming all we have are those cellulosic

360
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:27,000
fibers that we can then send to the the

361
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,879
the textile or unwoven companies and

362
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,600
what's really exciting in North Carolina

363
00:13:28,879 --> 00:13:32,639
to my knowledge and I may be may be

364
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:34,519
incorrect in saying this we are the only

365
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:37,440
state that has both decortication

366
00:13:34,519 --> 00:13:38,959
facilities and degumming Facilities um

367
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:41,680
and this is going to be really critical

368
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:43,719
when we think about the longterm picture

369
00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:45,039
with fiber him um you know we are

370
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:46,759
certainly doing a lot of shipping of

371
00:13:45,039 --> 00:13:48,919
materials from state to state but I

372
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:50,919
think when we you know talk about this

373
00:13:48,919 --> 00:13:52,278
crop really becoming a commodity crop in

374
00:13:50,919 --> 00:13:56,078
the United States we're going to have to

375
00:13:52,278 --> 00:13:58,838
see a lot more um close processing of

376
00:13:56,078 --> 00:14:00,919
these materials because shipping costs

377
00:13:58,839 --> 00:14:03,519
money and this is bulky material so

378
00:14:00,919 --> 00:14:05,759
we've got a number of dumers we've got a

379
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:07,759
number of decorators and then we also

380
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:09,639
have a number of spinners and Weavers

381
00:14:07,759 --> 00:14:11,278
and so on and so forth and so what what

382
00:14:09,639 --> 00:14:13,240
I like to see is yes there's interest

383
00:14:11,278 --> 00:14:14,879
from Farmers but also there's interest

384
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:16,360
from local processors that want that

385
00:14:14,879 --> 00:14:17,519
material and that really is critical

386
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:19,320
when we think about looking at a new

387
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:20,959
crop because if there's no demand and

388
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:24,959
there's nowhere to sell it why is a

389
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:26,119
farmer going to grow it now when we talk

390
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:27,799
about the research that we're doing at

391
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:29,360
NC State at least in my program as I

392
00:14:27,799 --> 00:14:30,958
mentioned I'm in a gr

393
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,600
and so we are looking at trying to

394
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:34,559
address some of the basic production

395
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:35,879
challenges that farmers have to ensure

396
00:14:34,559 --> 00:14:38,719
that they can produce a sustainable

397
00:14:35,879 --> 00:14:40,120
fiber crop and so I've got a list of uh

398
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:42,040
some of the different projects that my

399
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:43,480
program is working on but the other

400
00:14:42,039 --> 00:14:44,799
thing that I wanted to highlight is that

401
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:47,000
we're doing a lot of really interesting

402
00:14:44,799 --> 00:14:48,278
collaborations within the university um

403
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,078
so we're working a lot with folks in our

404
00:14:48,278 --> 00:14:52,838
College of Natural Resources they're

405
00:14:50,078 --> 00:14:56,039
looking more at um the pulping side of

406
00:14:52,839 --> 00:14:59,839
things and the use of herd for uh paper

407
00:14:56,039 --> 00:15:01,599
and packaging uh and uh s sanitation uh

408
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:03,720
uh materials and then of course we're

409
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:06,159
also doing a lot more collaboration with

410
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:07,399
folks in our Wilson College of textiles

411
00:15:06,159 --> 00:15:09,719
they of course are interested in

412
00:15:07,399 --> 00:15:12,600
applications of of this material in

413
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:14,440
apparel and non-woven materials and you

414
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:16,120
know this is always a plug if you're

415
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:17,440
ever in North Carolina you've got to

416
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:18,639
visit the College of textiles because

417
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,680
the work they do there is just

418
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:22,600
absolutely incredible and they are

419
00:15:20,679 --> 00:15:23,919
really really excited about fiber Hamp

420
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:26,120
and they're doing some very very cool

421
00:15:23,919 --> 00:15:27,439
things with fiber hemp when it comes to

422
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:29,440
you know developing new types of

423
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:31,600
garments or new ways of spinning and

424
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:34,639
incorporating hemp into um more

425
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:36,399
traditional lines so we do basic

426
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:38,519
agronomic work and we collect all

427
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:40,278
different types of data um but at the

428
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:42,278
end of the day there's two main pieces

429
00:15:40,278 --> 00:15:44,799
of data that are really important for

430
00:15:42,278 --> 00:15:46,600
Farmers quantity and quality right

431
00:15:44,799 --> 00:15:48,519
that's how I'm paid how many pounds of

432
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:50,079
tomatoes did I produce produce per acre

433
00:15:48,519 --> 00:15:51,720
and what's the grade of tomato that I

434
00:15:50,078 --> 00:15:55,318
produced because that's going to dictate

435
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:57,079
how I get paid now measuring quantity is

436
00:15:55,318 --> 00:15:59,360
easy I can measure the amount of dry

437
00:15:57,078 --> 00:16:01,799
reded straw and then I can decorticate

438
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:05,278
and I can measure the vast yields easy

439
00:16:01,799 --> 00:16:09,159
enough quality is an issue the reason

440
00:16:05,278 --> 00:16:12,519
for that is we do not yet have a set of

441
00:16:09,159 --> 00:16:14,120
um International or even national uh

442
00:16:12,519 --> 00:16:16,318
standards Universal standards when it

443
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:17,839
comes to fiber quality now that's not to

444
00:16:16,318 --> 00:16:20,679
say that people don't know what quality

445
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:22,360
is you know a Nike or a VF or a

446
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:24,439
Patagonia may have their definition of

447
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:27,600
of of quality but when you look at other

448
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:30,440
fiber crops like cotton there are USDA

449
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:32,480
um standards for cotton and it makes

450
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:35,160
grading cotton very easy but it also

451
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:36,519
makes our job as researchers easy too

452
00:16:35,159 --> 00:16:37,600
because we can look at the different

453
00:16:36,519 --> 00:16:39,278
treatments that we're applying in the

454
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:41,839
field and then relate that back to

455
00:16:39,278 --> 00:16:43,838
Quality and so in the absence of of

456
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:45,360
these quality metrics and I will say as

457
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:46,920
an aside there are many groups working

458
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:49,519
on this and so it's just a matter of

459
00:16:46,919 --> 00:16:51,838
time before we get them we are trying to

460
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:54,879
think about how we measure quality and I

461
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:56,639
like to think of quality in two uh bins

462
00:16:54,879 --> 00:16:57,919
one is just the basic fiber morphology

463
00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:00,039
right if you're to separate that fiber

464
00:16:57,919 --> 00:17:01,719
out you can measure its length its

465
00:17:00,039 --> 00:17:04,959
diameter or its daire which is kind of

466
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:06,318
the the diameter of of the the fiber its

467
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:09,000
T Cell strength so on and so forth so

468
00:17:06,318 --> 00:17:11,599
these are just basic morphological uh

469
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,240
properties of the fiber we can certainly

470
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:15,918
do that in fact we've got equipment that

471
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:17,318
can do that but there's another uh

472
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:19,240
bucket which is what I'm calling

473
00:17:17,318 --> 00:17:21,318
processability how easy is it to

474
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:24,318
decorticate meaning how easy is it to

475
00:17:21,318 --> 00:17:25,599
separate the herd from the vast how much

476
00:17:24,318 --> 00:17:28,879
cellulose is in there and how much

477
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:30,480
lignan and hemicellulose other um

478
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:33,679
impurities are in there because that's

479
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:37,038
going to digate uh uh that's going to

480
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:38,559
um that's going to dictate uh how much

481
00:17:37,038 --> 00:17:41,359
energy and resources are going to be

482
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:43,798
required to deum it this is very very

483
00:17:41,359 --> 00:17:45,439
important the reason why is if it

484
00:17:43,798 --> 00:17:47,759
requires a lot more energy to

485
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:50,160
decorticate or a lot more energy and

486
00:17:47,759 --> 00:17:52,319
inputs to De gum you will quickly

487
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:54,160
overwhelm any of the benefits you see in

488
00:17:52,319 --> 00:17:56,000
the fiber quality you're going to affect

489
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:57,759
the strength of the fiber you may even

490
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,558
damage the actual fibers cut them and so

491
00:17:57,759 --> 00:18:02,400
on and so forth and so what we're doing

492
00:18:00,558 --> 00:18:03,759
is trying to focus on both but a lot of

493
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,798
our work right now is actually focusing

494
00:18:03,759 --> 00:18:06,879
more on processability how can we

495
00:18:05,798 --> 00:18:08,918
produce stems that are easy to

496
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:10,720
decorticate and that require the least

497
00:18:08,919 --> 00:18:13,159
amount of chemistry chemistries or

498
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:14,880
energy and so on and so forth to degum

499
00:18:13,159 --> 00:18:18,960
because not only is that going to reduce

500
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:21,320
the cost Downstream but that should uh

501
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:22,558
keep us from damaging those fibers then

502
00:18:21,319 --> 00:18:24,200
we can start doing work whether it's

503
00:18:22,558 --> 00:18:26,839
Larry smart breeding for different types

504
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:29,038
of fibrom morphologies or or uh looking

505
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:31,038
at some of the other um you know

506
00:18:29,038 --> 00:18:33,000
agronomic practices to affect those

507
00:18:31,038 --> 00:18:34,200
those different uh morphological

508
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,279
properties

509
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:37,919
so let's jump into one of the first

510
00:18:36,279 --> 00:18:39,798
challenges we had and the first

511
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:41,360
challenge uh is beautifully Illustrated

512
00:18:39,798 --> 00:18:43,279
in this picture I think I use in every

513
00:18:41,359 --> 00:18:46,918
one of my talks this is a picture from

514
00:18:43,279 --> 00:18:48,519
2019 uh in hemp grower magazine and uh

515
00:18:46,919 --> 00:18:50,400
it's taken in North Carolina there was a

516
00:18:48,519 --> 00:18:52,599
really nice article about uh this

517
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:55,480
interest in fiber hemp in our state uh

518
00:18:52,599 --> 00:18:58,279
the gentleman on the left is Gary Sykes

519
00:18:55,480 --> 00:19:00,360
he is a hemp farmer and the gentle

520
00:18:58,279 --> 00:19:04,759
gentlem on the right is tamour AAR who

521
00:19:00,359 --> 00:19:06,439
is a um uh CEO of a hemp decortication

522
00:19:04,759 --> 00:19:08,158
company in North Carolina and they're

523
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:11,558
standing in a field of what should have

524
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:12,880
been fiber hemp that Gary planted now

525
00:19:11,558 --> 00:19:14,759
with fiber hemp we're going to harvest

526
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:16,679
this crop at the onset of flowering

527
00:19:14,759 --> 00:19:18,519
there's a couple reasons why one

528
00:19:16,679 --> 00:19:21,000
generally speaking we're not going to

529
00:19:18,519 --> 00:19:22,440
gain a lot more in terms of stem height

530
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,880
though we certainly do see some

531
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:28,000
increasing growth in in uh uh certain

532
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:29,039
varieties even during flowering but the

533
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,519
other is that we're going to have an

534
00:19:29,038 --> 00:19:31,679
increase in secondary fiber production

535
00:19:30,519 --> 00:19:33,319
in the stems we're going to have an

536
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:34,519
increase of ligant so goes back to

537
00:19:33,319 --> 00:19:36,639
processability it's going to be harder

538
00:19:34,519 --> 00:19:39,119
to process and it's going to affect uh

539
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:41,120
that fiber quality but you could see

540
00:19:39,119 --> 00:19:43,558
that uh Gary and Tamar are standing in a

541
00:19:41,119 --> 00:19:46,199
field that's maybe three feet tall um

542
00:19:43,558 --> 00:19:47,720
you know for this crop to be uh

543
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:50,919
profitable we need to be producing at

544
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:53,319
least six eight foot tall stems uh to

545
00:19:50,919 --> 00:19:56,080
produce enough biomass for to be worth

546
00:19:53,319 --> 00:19:57,480
Gary's time to harvest and the issue was

547
00:19:56,079 --> 00:19:58,879
that we didn't have regionally

548
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:00,200
appropriate variety

549
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:02,520
at the time we were only getting

550
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:06,120
varieties from uh you know countries

551
00:20:02,519 --> 00:20:08,319
like France and Italy and Poland and it

552
00:20:06,119 --> 00:20:10,839
is critical with a daylength sensitive

553
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:13,439
crop to understand where it was bred and

554
00:20:10,839 --> 00:20:16,000
what the latitude was and so uh I like

555
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:17,840
to share this map and what this map is

556
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,279
is it's lining up the latitudes with

557
00:20:17,839 --> 00:20:22,279
North America and with Europe and it

558
00:20:20,279 --> 00:20:24,200
beautifully illustrates how far north

559
00:20:22,279 --> 00:20:26,519
those countries are right um if we're

560
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:27,679
looking at New York for example you know

561
00:20:26,519 --> 00:20:29,279
okay I think those French varieties

562
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:30,480
might be a fit for you all but even then

563
00:20:29,279 --> 00:20:32,279
they're getting a little bit F farther

564
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:34,000
north but when you look down at North

565
00:20:32,279 --> 00:20:36,079
Carolina where we're right around 35

566
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,200
degrees north we're you know North

567
00:20:36,079 --> 00:20:40,000
Africa in terms of our latitude and this

568
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:43,279
is very very important because

569
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:46,000
daylengths differ so what I have here is

570
00:20:43,279 --> 00:20:47,879
just a plot of uh the the the average

571
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,720
day length for North Carolina Raleigh

572
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:51,919
where I am right now in Ithaca New York

573
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:53,640
you all are farther north so in the

574
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:55,440
middle of the summer when you have your

575
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:58,120
longest days they're going to be longer

576
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:59,519
than ours that's just how it works well

577
00:20:58,119 --> 00:21:01,119
let's look at France because a lot of

578
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:03,480
varieties were coming from France

579
00:21:01,119 --> 00:21:04,959
specifically from the L Valley it's even

580
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:06,679
farther north than New York and so when

581
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:08,640
you look at their day length they're

582
00:21:06,679 --> 00:21:11,400
even longer than your day lengths uh and

583
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:13,799
in fact if you look at our uh longest

584
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:16,640
day in North Carolina that light blue

585
00:21:13,798 --> 00:21:19,200
that is roughly the beginning of April

586
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:21,679
meaning beginning of Spring or the

587
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:23,720
beginning of October beginning of fall

588
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:25,240
in France and so it's no wonder that

589
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:27,319
when we plant a French Variety in North

590
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:30,079
Carolina it's going to go to flower very

591
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:32,079
very early just like we saw in Gary's

592
00:21:30,079 --> 00:21:34,038
field and so one of the first things

593
00:21:32,079 --> 00:21:35,839
that we did was look for varieties from

594
00:21:34,038 --> 00:21:37,119
different latitudes uh and we were able

595
00:21:35,839 --> 00:21:39,599
to obtain genetics from China

596
00:21:37,119 --> 00:21:41,519
specifically uh unan Province and so

597
00:21:39,599 --> 00:21:43,558
when we look there well this is great

598
00:21:41,519 --> 00:21:45,240
even farther south in North Carolina uh

599
00:21:43,558 --> 00:21:47,519
so we're looking at Kon Ming right now

600
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:50,120
which is about 25 degrees north so even

601
00:21:47,519 --> 00:21:51,960
farther south than us and with our first

602
00:21:50,119 --> 00:21:54,079
year in looking at them much better

603
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:56,120
production much better production and a

604
00:21:54,079 --> 00:21:59,199
much longer season so the individual in

605
00:21:56,119 --> 00:22:00,599
this photo excuse me is Alyssa Hawker

606
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:02,360
Alyssa just completed her master's

607
00:22:00,599 --> 00:22:04,480
degree and one of her projects was to

608
00:22:02,359 --> 00:22:06,798
look at these new Chinese genetics at

609
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:09,038
least new to us uh in terms of their fit

610
00:22:06,798 --> 00:22:10,599
for for daylength sensitivity uh and

611
00:22:09,038 --> 00:22:12,679
then biomass production as well as

612
00:22:10,599 --> 00:22:13,839
looking at planting dates and you know

613
00:22:12,679 --> 00:22:16,120
we had a lot of issues the first year

614
00:22:13,839 --> 00:22:17,480
with seed quality though uh our second

615
00:22:16,119 --> 00:22:19,599
year we had really really good seed

616
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:23,599
quality and these this it was a really

617
00:22:19,599 --> 00:22:25,158
really tremendous uh uh producing crop

618
00:22:23,599 --> 00:22:26,839
in fact we found that the the the

619
00:22:25,159 --> 00:22:28,120
flowering time was so late for us which

620
00:22:26,839 --> 00:22:30,038
was usually around the beginning of

621
00:22:28,119 --> 00:22:32,119
September that we really need to

622
00:22:30,038 --> 00:22:34,240
reconsider when we planted the crop

623
00:22:32,119 --> 00:22:36,079
because it just got too big for really

624
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,919
what we would consider textile grade

625
00:22:36,079 --> 00:22:39,839
fiber this is what it looked like at

626
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:41,840
Harvest um it really does look like

627
00:22:39,839 --> 00:22:43,319
bamboo admittedly once again as I said

628
00:22:41,839 --> 00:22:46,278
this is a little bit thicker than what I

629
00:22:43,319 --> 00:22:47,599
think we would want for textile purposes

630
00:22:46,278 --> 00:22:49,240
generally speaking what the textile

631
00:22:47,599 --> 00:22:51,240
industry says is they want it to be the

632
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:53,519
width of a number two pencil 7 and a

633
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:55,798
half millimeters uh and this is a little

634
00:22:53,519 --> 00:22:57,599
bit on the thick side now even though

635
00:22:55,798 --> 00:22:59,639
these were a good fit for us in terms of

636
00:22:57,599 --> 00:23:01,639
dayling sensitivity there are still

637
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:03,559
added challenges that we're now trying

638
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:05,720
to address the first is just basic

639
00:23:03,558 --> 00:23:08,440
economics right if I'm having to ship

640
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:10,519
seed across the globe from China there's

641
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:13,440
added cost to that and so right now seed

642
00:23:10,519 --> 00:23:15,000
is around $4 a pound um and we really

643
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:17,600
want to see more domestic seed

644
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,759
production um you know I I I know that

645
00:23:17,599 --> 00:23:19,759
there are a lot of folks including Larry

646
00:23:18,759 --> 00:23:21,640
and I'll talk about that in a second

647
00:23:19,759 --> 00:23:23,839
that are doing uh breeding work and

648
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:25,200
there are others uh Trey riddle who I

649
00:23:23,839 --> 00:23:27,199
think was on early but I know we'll be

650
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:29,200
speaking they've got their own variety

651
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:32,000
and so you know having more domestic

652
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:33,159
seeds that work for us or other parts of

653
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,319
the country is going to be critical in

654
00:23:33,159 --> 00:23:36,960
reducing the cost of production but

655
00:23:35,319 --> 00:23:39,119
another big issue with these Chinese

656
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:42,200
genetics is that they go hot and so what

657
00:23:39,119 --> 00:23:43,399
I have up here are our total THC values

658
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:45,038
that we collected from these different

659
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:49,519
varieties in 21 and

660
00:23:45,038 --> 00:23:52,319
22 the Bold numbers are above 3% right

661
00:23:49,519 --> 00:23:54,000
that USDA threshold and then that red

662
00:23:52,319 --> 00:23:56,158
bold with the exclamation point is

663
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,558
getting really close to that 1%

664
00:23:56,159 --> 00:24:00,640
negligent violation which is very

665
00:23:57,558 --> 00:24:02,319
concern ER and you'll notice that it's

666
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:04,840
not every year that we see those values

667
00:24:02,319 --> 00:24:07,119
go hot and so Larry and his crew have

668
00:24:04,839 --> 00:24:08,759
done a really tremendous uh job in

669
00:24:07,119 --> 00:24:11,119
looking at these Chinese genetics and

670
00:24:08,759 --> 00:24:13,599
they found that they're really a

671
00:24:11,119 --> 00:24:17,038
population and within that population

672
00:24:13,599 --> 00:24:18,278
we'll say of Yuma Yuma one um you're

673
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:20,440
going to have individuals that still

674
00:24:18,278 --> 00:24:22,720
have that Gene to produce THC and some

675
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:24,640
that don't and so when a farmer plants

676
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:27,360
this they're kind of playing Russian

677
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:29,880
roulette because there's really no way

678
00:24:27,359 --> 00:24:31,519
without testing it prior to know if it's

679
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:33,440
got that Gene or not what's also

680
00:24:31,519 --> 00:24:34,480
important to note is that these plants

681
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:36,080
even though they were starting to

682
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:37,919
produce male flowers were not really

683
00:24:36,079 --> 00:24:39,439
truly flowering most of the material

684
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:41,000
that we were having tested was was

685
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:43,798
vegetative leaf and stem and it was

686
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:45,000
still going quite hot and so I know that

687
00:24:43,798 --> 00:24:46,639
Larry has been doing breeding work we

688
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,919
are collaborating with Larry in

689
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:50,200
screening some of his materials uh down

690
00:24:48,919 --> 00:24:52,360
south and he's I know he's working with

691
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:54,038
others uh and we're continuing to do

692
00:24:52,359 --> 00:24:55,439
variety trials and so this is what our

693
00:24:54,038 --> 00:24:58,720
variety trial looked like this past year

694
00:24:55,440 --> 00:25:00,960
in 2023 um let me see if this

695
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:02,159
so the variety on the the bottom left

696
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,319
that's actually one of Larry's genetics

697
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:05,559
which looked really good you could see

698
00:25:03,319 --> 00:25:07,599
not flowering uh the variety next to it

699
00:25:05,558 --> 00:25:08,839
is one from Colorado and then two over

700
00:25:07,599 --> 00:25:10,480
it's another from Colorado you can see

701
00:25:08,839 --> 00:25:12,119
that it's already starting to flower so

702
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:14,240
once again you know it really is going

703
00:25:12,119 --> 00:25:15,319
to the background in terms of where they

704
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:18,038
come from but then also where their

705
00:25:15,319 --> 00:25:20,158
bread is going to be really really

706
00:25:18,038 --> 00:25:21,599
important the final challenge that we

707
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:23,360
have with these Chinese genetics is what

708
00:25:21,599 --> 00:25:25,480
we're calling phenotypic plasticity or

709
00:25:23,359 --> 00:25:26,879
what is known as phenotypic plasticity

710
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:29,558
and what that is is just basically a

711
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:31,399
plant's ability to change its phenotype

712
00:25:29,558 --> 00:25:34,200
based off of the resources that it's

713
00:25:31,398 --> 00:25:35,759
given and for some reason we see that in

714
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:37,840
these Chinese varieties there's a lot

715
00:25:35,759 --> 00:25:40,359
more phenotypic plasticity than there

716
00:25:37,839 --> 00:25:42,398
are in the Italian varieties or in the

717
00:25:40,359 --> 00:25:44,359
French varieties if you give these

718
00:25:42,398 --> 00:25:46,398
Chinese varieties a lot of space they

719
00:25:44,359 --> 00:25:48,678
become trees they get really thick they

720
00:25:46,398 --> 00:25:50,879
produce a lot of stems and it's neat to

721
00:25:48,679 --> 00:25:52,759
look at but it's really of no use from a

722
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:54,278
textille uh perspective and it's going

723
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:56,759
to be a real challenge to just Harvest

724
00:25:54,278 --> 00:25:59,119
it and so um we can see that in this

725
00:25:56,759 --> 00:26:01,000
picture so um this is from one of

726
00:25:59,119 --> 00:26:03,639
Alyssa's first studies I believe this

727
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:05,000
variety on the left is is puma and we

728
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:06,880
had really poor seed quality but you

729
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,398
could see there's so much space around

730
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:10,360
that they become these thick trees with

731
00:26:08,398 --> 00:26:12,959
lots of branches whereas on the right

732
00:26:10,359 --> 00:26:15,599
this is Yuma one better stands though

733
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:19,399
not great but the stems are much thinner

734
00:26:15,599 --> 00:26:21,678
and um they've got a lot less branching

735
00:26:19,398 --> 00:26:24,000
so until we can breed out this

736
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:26,200
phenotypic plasticity which you know

737
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,319
that's a job for Larry we need to focus

738
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:30,080
more on plant popul

739
00:26:28,319 --> 00:26:32,720
because if we look at just some of the

740
00:26:30,079 --> 00:26:34,918
the basic data from alysa's study we see

741
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:35,640
that as we increase plant populations on

742
00:26:34,919 --> 00:26:38,080
the

743
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:43,159
xaxis we see a decrease in stem diameter

744
00:26:38,079 --> 00:26:45,918
on the y- axis that is the um basics of

745
00:26:43,159 --> 00:26:47,960
of phenotypic plasticity and so this

746
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:49,679
past summer uh one of my new master

747
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:52,240
students picture on the left this is Sam

748
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:54,360
Caroll is working on a plant density

749
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:56,319
study and what Sam is doing is she's

750
00:26:54,359 --> 00:26:58,359
looking at different plant stands

751
00:26:56,319 --> 00:27:00,158
ranging from 300,000 plants per acre

752
00:26:58,359 --> 00:27:02,278
which is very low all the way up to one

753
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:04,080
and a half million plants per acre now

754
00:27:02,278 --> 00:27:07,079
how did she do this well first we

755
00:27:04,079 --> 00:27:09,158
overseed our plots by about 30% and then

756
00:27:07,079 --> 00:27:11,079
we came in we counted every single plant

757
00:27:09,159 --> 00:27:13,399
per plot and then we thinned them out to

758
00:27:11,079 --> 00:27:14,879
get the exact density that we needed for

759
00:27:13,398 --> 00:27:18,239
that specific treatment was a lot of

760
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:20,159
work but it's a great study and um what

761
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:21,880
Sam did is throughout the season she was

762
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:23,159
measur measuring stem diameter and stem

763
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:24,880
height and then of course she harvested

764
00:27:23,159 --> 00:27:26,240
that material and so um what I'll just

765
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:28,399
be sharing with you today are some of

766
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:29,880
the uh height and width data she's in

767
00:27:28,398 --> 00:27:31,879
the process of decorticating it so we

768
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:33,880
can look at Bast and then quality and so

769
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:35,960
on and so forth so what we're looking at

770
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:38,640
here is stem height over time and these

771
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:40,558
are just plotted no hard analysis but

772
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:43,559
they once again show basic plasticity

773
00:27:40,558 --> 00:27:44,599
right the black is that 300,000 per acre

774
00:27:43,558 --> 00:27:46,359
and you see that it's they're going to

775
00:27:44,599 --> 00:27:47,798
be taller uh and they're also going to

776
00:27:46,359 --> 00:27:51,398
be a lot thicker and there also is a lot

777
00:27:47,798 --> 00:27:53,798
more spread and so um what I also want

778
00:27:51,398 --> 00:27:55,879
to show is the distribution of stem

779
00:27:53,798 --> 00:27:58,079
diameters one of the other things that

780
00:27:55,880 --> 00:28:00,600
the textile industry says that is

781
00:27:58,079 --> 00:28:02,519
critical is consistency right they want

782
00:28:00,599 --> 00:28:03,959
consistency in product and they want

783
00:28:02,519 --> 00:28:05,880
consistency when it comes to stem

784
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:08,319
diameter and so we wanted to see how

785
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:10,200
that would affect um the distributions

786
00:28:08,319 --> 00:28:11,960
right what do our stem diameters look

787
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:13,798
like within the plots and so this is

788
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:16,079
just showing the the densities of our

789
00:28:13,798 --> 00:28:17,960
diameter over time so on week three and

790
00:28:16,079 --> 00:28:20,839
you can see that bottom yellow is

791
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:23,079
300,000 the top is 1.5 million and look

792
00:28:20,839 --> 00:28:25,879
at how wide the distribution is on

793
00:28:23,079 --> 00:28:28,359
300,000 right we're just getting a very

794
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:30,039
inconsistent stem diam and so we're

795
00:28:28,359 --> 00:28:34,079
really trying to focus on getting a much

796
00:28:30,038 --> 00:28:35,679
narrower stem yes but also a lot more

797
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:38,918
consistency

798
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:40,798
and next what we're looking at is the

799
00:28:38,919 --> 00:28:42,799
height and stem width at Harvest so we

800
00:28:40,798 --> 00:28:45,119
come in we cut the stems and then we

801
00:28:42,798 --> 00:28:47,000
measure them this is nothing new right

802
00:28:45,119 --> 00:28:49,079
we're seeing that as we increase plant

803
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:51,240
populations our stem height goes down

804
00:28:49,079 --> 00:28:53,038
which is going to happen but also that

805
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:54,759
stem diameter is going to go down and

806
00:28:53,038 --> 00:28:55,919
we're getting close to that magic even

807
00:28:54,759 --> 00:28:58,079
though I don't think it's really magical

808
00:28:55,919 --> 00:29:00,000
7 and a half millimeters

809
00:28:58,079 --> 00:29:02,359
around a million seeds per acre give or

810
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:05,079
take or I should say Pure Life seed per

811
00:29:02,359 --> 00:29:08,319
acre but what's really interesting is

812
00:29:05,079 --> 00:29:09,918
when we look at thinning so hemp and all

813
00:29:08,319 --> 00:29:11,519
crops do what is called self thinning if

814
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:13,679
you plant enough meaning they're going

815
00:29:11,519 --> 00:29:14,798
to compete with one another in a plot

816
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:15,960
and they're going to shade each other

817
00:29:14,798 --> 00:29:18,798
out they're going to kill each other

818
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:21,200
until they reach an equilibrium and so

819
00:29:18,798 --> 00:29:23,278
on the top plot what we have is the

820
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:25,038
perent stand thinning meaning we know

821
00:29:23,278 --> 00:29:27,599
what we started with and then we know

822
00:29:25,038 --> 00:29:30,000
what we ended with was there any death

823
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:32,240
that happened you know during the season

824
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:34,599
and we see that even in our 300,000

825
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:38,079
there's about 30% self thinning and that

826
00:29:34,599 --> 00:29:40,759
as we increase our uh populations we're

827
00:29:38,079 --> 00:29:42,398
getting an increase in thinning what's

828
00:29:40,759 --> 00:29:44,720
really interesting is when we look at

829
00:29:42,398 --> 00:29:46,239
our final populations so we counted in

830
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:48,759
the beginning and then we counted at the

831
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:49,880
end we see that we actually Plateau at

832
00:29:48,759 --> 00:29:52,480
about

833
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:53,880
750,000 uh plants per acre right even

834
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:55,880
though we started with one and a half

835
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:59,880
million it all seems to had this

836
00:29:55,880 --> 00:30:01,640
equilibrium around 700 to 750,000 now

837
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:03,120
this is one year of research we're

838
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:04,159
obviously going to be continuing this

839
00:30:03,119 --> 00:30:06,158
again and we're going to look at quality

840
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:07,360
and so on um but it's really really

841
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:08,480
quite interesting and great work that

842
00:30:07,359 --> 00:30:10,798
Sam has

843
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:12,399
done another project that Sam is working

844
00:30:10,798 --> 00:30:14,599
on and this is uh one that we are doing

845
00:30:12,398 --> 00:30:16,000
in collaboration with IND hemp is

846
00:30:14,599 --> 00:30:17,759
understanding Harvest timing you can see

847
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,200
here here at our first harvest timing

848
00:30:17,759 --> 00:30:21,278
and then at our last and so we're

849
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:23,000
looking at two varieties Yuma which is

850
00:30:21,278 --> 00:30:25,000
Chinese variety and IH Williams which is

851
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,759
coming from IND hemp and we're looking

852
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:29,759
at different Harvest timing so quite

853
00:30:26,759 --> 00:30:32,000
early on the stems are 5T tall then at

854
00:30:29,759 --> 00:30:34,879
What's called the GV point which is when

855
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:36,880
there's a shift in photax so hemp

856
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:38,640
generally is opposites the leaves are

857
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:40,519
opposite one another on the stem but at

858
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:42,278
a certain point in the life cycle

859
00:30:40,519 --> 00:30:44,839
generally before blooming they're going

860
00:30:42,278 --> 00:30:48,119
to shift from opposite to altern it and

861
00:30:44,839 --> 00:30:50,199
they're going to um basically continue

862
00:30:48,119 --> 00:30:52,558
on that way so we've got five feet tall

863
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:54,038
then the GV point then male flowering

864
00:30:52,558 --> 00:30:55,960
which is more or less the traditional

865
00:30:54,038 --> 00:30:57,879
timing for textiles and then female

866
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:59,919
flowering which is a bit late and the

867
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:01,799
goal here is to understand yes what what

868
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:03,799
are biomass and bass yields but really

869
00:31:01,798 --> 00:31:05,599
hone in on quality and then understand

870
00:31:03,798 --> 00:31:07,638
what are the applications of these

871
00:31:05,599 --> 00:31:09,678
fibers so let's say a fiber can't get a

872
00:31:07,638 --> 00:31:11,719
farmer can't get to the crop uh until

873
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:13,038
female flowering well what can we do

874
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:14,880
with that product maybe maybe it's not

875
00:31:13,038 --> 00:31:17,278
great for apparel but maybe it can go

876
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:20,519
into non- Loven just so that we can have

877
00:31:17,278 --> 00:31:22,119
other ways for Farmers to get a decent

878
00:31:20,519 --> 00:31:23,720
pay for their crop even if it wouldn't

879
00:31:22,119 --> 00:31:25,918
be technically

880
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:28,000
ideal she also had to do water reading

881
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:28,919
for this study and or Sam as I was

882
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,440
putting this together I was reallying we

883
00:31:28,919 --> 00:31:32,840
put her through a lot if anyone is ever

884
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:35,240
water redded it's disgusting it smells

885
00:31:32,839 --> 00:31:36,959
awful um so Sam is very very dedicated

886
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:38,159
to the research um and we could

887
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:40,519
certainly talk about water breing a

888
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:41,799
little bit later weed management is

889
00:31:40,519 --> 00:31:43,720
another big issue that we have in the

890
00:31:41,798 --> 00:31:47,398
Southeast and in general um this year we

891
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:49,278
did have um a new well a herbicide

892
00:31:47,398 --> 00:31:50,678
labeled for use which is sonland which

893
00:31:49,278 --> 00:31:52,079
is great I know farmers are going to use

894
00:31:50,679 --> 00:31:53,759
it but there are also a lot of farmers

895
00:31:52,079 --> 00:31:55,638
that don't want to cultivate or are

896
00:31:53,759 --> 00:31:57,359
already employing no till practices and

897
00:31:55,638 --> 00:31:59,240
they don't want to go back to tillage

898
00:31:57,359 --> 00:32:01,879
now uh this is work that's being

899
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:04,679
conducted by uh my new PhD student

900
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:05,919
Ashley George who's pictured here uh and

901
00:32:04,679 --> 00:32:09,200
Ashley's got a number of projects that

902
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:11,679
I'll be talking about um and when we're

903
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:13,480
talking about weed management it's not

904
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:15,038
uncommon if Farmers have a really weedy

905
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:16,960
field in North Carolina didn't get the

906
00:32:15,038 --> 00:32:18,960
right planting they didn't get good um

907
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:20,399
crop emergence we can see what happens

908
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:21,240
on the left where we just lose the field

909
00:32:20,398 --> 00:32:23,439
to

910
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:25,960
weeds we also know that we can get

911
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:29,038
really good stands uh and really good

912
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:30,960
canopy closure quite early early um with

913
00:32:29,038 --> 00:32:32,798
uh many of these fiber hemp varieties so

914
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:34,558
the picture on the right is roughly

915
00:32:32,798 --> 00:32:35,679
canopy closure getting close to it and

916
00:32:34,558 --> 00:32:37,119
that was only about three and a half

917
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:39,320
weeks after planting it's a very quick

918
00:32:37,119 --> 00:32:41,278
growing crop admittedly we did use a

919
00:32:39,319 --> 00:32:43,599
herbicide here and so we're looking for

920
00:32:41,278 --> 00:32:45,679
alternative ways to manage weeds and so

921
00:32:43,599 --> 00:32:48,278
two years ago we initiated trials using

922
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:50,440
a noil system where we plant into a

923
00:32:48,278 --> 00:32:52,558
Serial Ry mulch this is a common system

924
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:54,840
for organic grain producers where they

925
00:32:52,558 --> 00:32:56,398
grow cereal R over the winter they roll

926
00:32:54,839 --> 00:32:59,079
it down and I'll show this in a little

927
00:32:56,398 --> 00:33:00,879
bit and then they plant into it and the

928
00:32:59,079 --> 00:33:02,599
idea is that that mulch acts as a weed

929
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:04,720
barrier but it still allows the crop to

930
00:33:02,599 --> 00:33:07,278
come up and we did it and it didn't

931
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:10,079
really work out well for us and what we

932
00:33:07,278 --> 00:33:13,398
found is that the cial Rye mulch was

933
00:33:10,079 --> 00:33:15,519
simply too thick we could not get good

934
00:33:13,398 --> 00:33:18,199
seed placement with our drill into that

935
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:20,720
Mulch and the reason for that is when

936
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:22,440
you look at no till corn or beans

937
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:24,000
they're not using a drill generally

938
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:25,639
speaking they're using a planter with

939
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,919
wider row spacing than we are with fiber

940
00:33:25,638 --> 00:33:31,158
hemp at seven and a half inches

941
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:33,200
and with a planter you have a lot more

942
00:33:31,159 --> 00:33:35,679
ability to move that material out of the

943
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:38,278
way that you can't do with the drill and

944
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:40,000
so we kind of steep back and reevaluated

945
00:33:38,278 --> 00:33:41,159
the system and so what Ashley's doing is

946
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,599
she's looking at a number of other

947
00:33:41,159 --> 00:33:43,880
different cover crops so yes we're

948
00:33:42,599 --> 00:33:45,319
looking at seral Ry though we are

949
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:47,600
reducing the biomass that's produced

950
00:33:45,319 --> 00:33:49,200
through limiting fertility applications

951
00:33:47,599 --> 00:33:50,798
we're looking at tral which is another

952
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:53,600
grass that doesn't produce quite as much

953
00:33:50,798 --> 00:33:55,200
biomass and then we're looking at uh two

954
00:33:53,599 --> 00:33:57,319
leguminous cover crops Harry vet and

955
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:58,960
crimson clover now these two are not

956
00:33:57,319 --> 00:34:01,119
used in no till traditionally because

957
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:03,480
they've got a high or excuse me a lower

958
00:34:01,119 --> 00:34:06,199
carbon to nitrogen ratio so that biomass

959
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:08,240
degrades quickly and it's not going to

960
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:10,320
provide season long weed management but

961
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:12,918
that's not necessarily a problem right

962
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:14,200
because as I showed fiber hemp can get

963
00:34:12,918 --> 00:34:15,960
canopy closure around three to four

964
00:34:14,199 --> 00:34:17,719
weeks after planting and then once it's

965
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:19,639
off it's off it can take care of the

966
00:34:17,719 --> 00:34:22,239
weeds so we really only need help those

967
00:34:19,639 --> 00:34:24,838
first four weeks or so and then of

968
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:26,199
course she has a bare clean so no cover

969
00:34:24,838 --> 00:34:27,759
crop that's bare and we're going to weed

970
00:34:26,199 --> 00:34:30,039
it throughout the season and then a bare

971
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:31,359
weedi where we kept it clean prior

972
00:34:30,039 --> 00:34:33,759
planted the hemp and then let the weeds

973
00:34:31,358 --> 00:34:35,000
take over as our control and so if

974
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:36,320
you've never seen the system before we

975
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:38,079
come in with a roller crimper so you can

976
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:40,079
see we just rolled down Crim uh hary

977
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:41,519
vetch this is what I I know I shouldn't

978
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:44,039
put videos in Zoom so I hope this is

979
00:34:41,519 --> 00:34:46,480
coming through okay um but this is just

980
00:34:44,039 --> 00:34:49,679
a video of us rolling down cereal Ry it

981
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:51,440
is always fun to just watch um and then

982
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:53,760
we come in with a no till drill and so

983
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:55,960
the noil drill just has uh these couters

984
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:57,680
up front that cut through that residue

985
00:34:55,960 --> 00:35:00,119
and open up a little bit of a seed

986
00:34:57,679 --> 00:35:02,799
trench and we place the seed and then

987
00:35:00,119 --> 00:35:03,920
the the closing Wheels Clos it that's it

988
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:05,480
and so she was looking at a lot of

989
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:07,400
different data obviously looking at

990
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:08,719
emergence um but what we're after is

991
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:09,760
something like this and admittedly I'd

992
00:35:08,719 --> 00:35:11,838
like to see the stands a little bit

993
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:14,280
better but this is still quite good uh

994
00:35:11,838 --> 00:35:16,599
this is uh fiber hemp coming through a

995
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:18,720
hary vetch Mulch and you'll notice that

996
00:35:16,599 --> 00:35:20,720
we're getting decent stands though you

997
00:35:18,719 --> 00:35:22,519
know as I said you could see some gaps

998
00:35:20,719 --> 00:35:24,639
but not a single weed that that hary

999
00:35:22,519 --> 00:35:27,440
Veet is doing a really great job at uh

1000
00:35:24,639 --> 00:35:28,719
reducing uh weed emergence and so let's

1001
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:30,519
jump into some of these data what I've

1002
00:35:28,719 --> 00:35:31,799
got here are our stands at the beginning

1003
00:35:30,519 --> 00:35:35,320
of the season because that was an issue

1004
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:36,960
in our first year of Trials um and I

1005
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:39,039
I'll admit the stands are lower than we

1006
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:42,039
wanted in general and so we need to work

1007
00:35:39,039 --> 00:35:44,719
on that but what is very important to

1008
00:35:42,039 --> 00:35:47,480
note is that when you look at our clean

1009
00:35:44,719 --> 00:35:49,118
uh uh control so that's the black box

1010
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:52,199
and then our wedy clean which is this

1011
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:53,920
this lightish Orange Box notice that on

1012
00:35:52,199 --> 00:35:55,879
the whole statistically speaking except

1013
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:57,559
for in Kinston they're not different

1014
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:58,920
from our no tail PL

1015
00:35:57,559 --> 00:36:02,000
this is really important because what

1016
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:04,240
that tells us is that it's not the cover

1017
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:06,519
crop that is reducing The Stance now

1018
00:36:04,239 --> 00:36:08,598
when we look at Kinston yes we do see

1019
00:36:06,519 --> 00:36:11,519
that crimson clover and Rye were

1020
00:36:08,599 --> 00:36:14,240
significantly lower than our um two

1021
00:36:11,519 --> 00:36:15,759
controls the Rye is not a huge uh

1022
00:36:14,239 --> 00:36:17,879
surprise given what we saw the first

1023
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:19,680
year what was a big surprise is what we

1024
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:21,039
saw with Harry vetch we're still

1025
00:36:19,679 --> 00:36:23,078
scratching our heads as to why we had

1026
00:36:21,039 --> 00:36:24,519
such good stands in Harry vetch I think

1027
00:36:23,079 --> 00:36:28,480
you know things just worked out well for

1028
00:36:24,519 --> 00:36:30,599
us um no till syst are quite complex uh

1029
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:32,358
and there's there's a lot that goes into

1030
00:36:30,599 --> 00:36:34,119
getting it just right so we're going to

1031
00:36:32,358 --> 00:36:35,559
we're obviously continuing this work um

1032
00:36:34,119 --> 00:36:36,838
but we're really really happy with what

1033
00:36:35,559 --> 00:36:38,679
we're seeing overall especially with

1034
00:36:36,838 --> 00:36:40,519
Harry Veet now when we look at stands at

1035
00:36:38,679 --> 00:36:42,000
the end of the season we don't see any

1036
00:36:40,519 --> 00:36:44,559
differences and the only differences

1037
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:46,880
that we do see are in Kinston and once

1038
00:36:44,559 --> 00:36:49,078
again higher stands Al although there is

1039
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:50,440
some self- thinning right that stand is

1040
00:36:49,079 --> 00:36:53,000
lower than what it was at the beginning

1041
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:55,119
of the season but it's got higher stands

1042
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,920
than uh all of the other treatments so

1043
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:58,200
we're feeling pretty good about that and

1044
00:36:56,920 --> 00:37:00,119
then when we look at just the basics of

1045
00:36:58,199 --> 00:37:01,759
height and diameter we see no difference

1046
00:37:00,119 --> 00:37:03,960
among our treatments no differences

1047
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:05,640
among height in any of our locations and

1048
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:06,920
no differences in Clinton or Goldsboro

1049
00:37:05,639 --> 00:37:09,679
when we look at our diameter which are

1050
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:11,318
these these bottom to here we do see

1051
00:37:09,679 --> 00:37:12,679
differences in Kinston but the main

1052
00:37:11,318 --> 00:37:15,440
differences are really once again coming

1053
00:37:12,679 --> 00:37:16,838
from Harry vet higher stands means

1054
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:18,280
thinner stems right we've already gone

1055
00:37:16,838 --> 00:37:20,920
over this and that's really what's

1056
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:22,319
driving those differences there now we

1057
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:23,720
want to get the stands still a little

1058
00:37:22,318 --> 00:37:25,358
bit better we're going to look at

1059
00:37:23,719 --> 00:37:27,799
quality the other thing that Ashley's

1060
00:37:25,358 --> 00:37:29,039
looking at too is how much biomass is

1061
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:30,760
left from the cover crops at the end of

1062
00:37:29,039 --> 00:37:31,880
the season because remember we're going

1063
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:33,160
to cut this we're going to leave it in

1064
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:35,079
the field and then we're going to bail

1065
00:37:33,159 --> 00:37:36,559
it and so there's a big concern that

1066
00:37:35,079 --> 00:37:38,720
we're going to just pull up all of that

1067
00:37:36,559 --> 00:37:41,318
Rye or pull up all of that vetch when we

1068
00:37:38,719 --> 00:37:43,519
bail it um what we're seeing is there is

1069
00:37:41,318 --> 00:37:45,079
still some residue from our our um

1070
00:37:43,519 --> 00:37:47,400
luminous cover crops though it's much

1071
00:37:45,079 --> 00:37:49,760
much lower than what we're getting from

1072
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:52,358
our uh grasses but once again we're

1073
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:53,640
we're continuing on with this work and

1074
00:37:52,358 --> 00:37:55,440
then I want to include this cool picture

1075
00:37:53,639 --> 00:37:57,598
that Ashley showed so on the left of the

1076
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:58,559
dotted line is our clover plot no till

1077
00:37:57,599 --> 00:37:59,960
and you could see that actually the

1078
00:37:58,559 --> 00:38:01,519
Clover went to seed and so we're getting

1079
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:03,358
some of that popping up not great and

1080
00:38:01,519 --> 00:38:05,599
you could see through the plot so not

1081
00:38:03,358 --> 00:38:08,039
great stands on the right is our vetch

1082
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:11,318
you can see a no vetch coming up but B

1083
00:38:08,039 --> 00:38:13,119
is a dense dense stand um and another

1084
00:38:11,318 --> 00:38:16,079
thing that we saw with Clover is you

1085
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:17,960
really have to be careful about um

1086
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:20,000
killing it before it goes to seed

1087
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:22,358
because it can become actually a weed I

1088
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:24,400
know there's a lot of talk about green

1089
00:38:22,358 --> 00:38:26,279
uh mulches but it really does not work

1090
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:28,880
with hemp this hemp was very stunted you

1091
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:31,280
could see all of that Clover emerging it

1092
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:33,039
does not like it it you cannot have that

1093
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:35,839
for a hemp

1094
00:38:33,039 --> 00:38:37,719
system the other work that she is uh um

1095
00:38:35,838 --> 00:38:39,838
looking at Ashley that is is nitrogen

1096
00:38:37,719 --> 00:38:41,519
management we know that this is the

1097
00:38:39,838 --> 00:38:43,639
biggest limiting factor when it comes to

1098
00:38:41,519 --> 00:38:45,920
nutrients and so Ashley is looking at a

1099
00:38:43,639 --> 00:38:47,838
range of of nitrogen rates from zero all

1100
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:49,720
the way up to 250 pounds per acre but

1101
00:38:47,838 --> 00:38:51,719
she's also looking at the inclusion of

1102
00:38:49,719 --> 00:38:53,118
leguminous cover crops crimson clover

1103
00:38:51,719 --> 00:38:54,879
and hary veg right they're fixing

1104
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:56,519
nitrogen over the fall and winter and

1105
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:58,280
then we incorporate that into the the

1106
00:38:56,519 --> 00:39:01,280
Fields the idea is that we can use all

1107
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:03,240
of that for our crop and so um this is

1108
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:04,960
just a fun picture of the edge effect if

1109
00:39:03,239 --> 00:39:06,279
you've never seen it this is a zero plot

1110
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:09,318
but you could see the edge around the

1111
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:10,880
plot where uh the hemp is basically SCA

1112
00:39:09,318 --> 00:39:12,279
scavening for anything it can get and it

1113
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:15,800
looks quite quite different so we always

1114
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:17,680
make sure to harvest within the plot um

1115
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:19,160
we take a lot of data we're doing weekly

1116
00:39:17,679 --> 00:39:21,078
measurements Heights and widths we're

1117
00:39:19,159 --> 00:39:23,358
looking at chlorophyll we're looking at

1118
00:39:21,079 --> 00:39:24,400
Leaf nitrate ammonium and so on and so

1119
00:39:23,358 --> 00:39:26,759
forth and then we're looking at these

1120
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:28,519
different uh metrics at Harvest I'm kind

1121
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:31,599
of running out of time so I'm going to

1122
00:39:28,519 --> 00:39:34,519
go by these uh these are just U height

1123
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:36,480
data not that interesting I will say

1124
00:39:34,519 --> 00:39:38,440
though in Clinton we didn't get great uh

1125
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:40,039
crimson clover uh stands and you could

1126
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:41,639
see that the height wasn't great in

1127
00:39:40,039 --> 00:39:43,719
Clinton in our plots that just received

1128
00:39:41,639 --> 00:39:45,759
crimson clover and we see a pretty

1129
00:39:43,719 --> 00:39:47,199
strong nitrogen effect the yellow and

1130
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:48,560
then the lighter greens are lower

1131
00:39:47,199 --> 00:39:50,279
nitrogen and then the darker greens are

1132
00:39:48,559 --> 00:39:52,318
higher nitrogen so the higher the

1133
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:55,119
nitrogen the taller the stem but we see

1134
00:39:52,318 --> 00:39:57,519
that with our our hary vet that it's

1135
00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:59,440
comparable to about 50 to 100 pounds of

1136
00:39:57,519 --> 00:40:01,639
nitrogen which is um normally what we

1137
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:03,240
can produce with that cover crop in our

1138
00:40:01,639 --> 00:40:04,838
kinson location we saw that both both

1139
00:40:03,239 --> 00:40:07,199
cover crops actually did quite well just

1140
00:40:04,838 --> 00:40:08,759
in terms of height now um compared to

1141
00:40:07,199 --> 00:40:11,039
our other nitrogen treatments and we're

1142
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:13,000
comparable to our 200 250 pounds of

1143
00:40:11,039 --> 00:40:15,559
nitrogen so you know we don't think we

1144
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:18,880
need 200 and 250 pounds of nitrogen but

1145
00:40:15,559 --> 00:40:20,920
um it certainly does quite well um as

1146
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:22,720
just a pure nitrogen source so keep an

1147
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:24,639
eye out for more of that

1148
00:40:22,719 --> 00:40:26,439
research the other work that that

1149
00:40:24,639 --> 00:40:28,358
Ashley's doing is looking at reading so

1150
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:30,639
reading is both an art and a science in

1151
00:40:28,358 --> 00:40:33,239
the sense that we know that there are a

1152
00:40:30,639 --> 00:40:35,559
lot of factors that affect reading we

1153
00:40:33,239 --> 00:40:39,159
know that temperature and moisture and

1154
00:40:35,559 --> 00:40:41,960
rain and microbes all affect reading but

1155
00:40:39,159 --> 00:40:43,519
we don't really know how to measure

1156
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:47,119
those and give good predictions in terms

1157
00:40:43,519 --> 00:40:50,239
of if a farmer harvests a crop on July 1

1158
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:52,480
I want to be able to pull down data that

1159
00:40:50,239 --> 00:40:55,000
can help them make the decision when to

1160
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:58,400
to pull the the crop out of the field

1161
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:59,920
and so uh what Ashley is doing is she's

1162
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:02,039
uh growing out you know large acreage of

1163
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:03,838
hemp and then she's putting out these

1164
00:41:02,039 --> 00:41:06,000
different sensors so we're looking at uh

1165
00:41:03,838 --> 00:41:07,880
ambient temperature rainfall uh Leaf

1166
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:10,639
moisture so on and so forth and then

1167
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:12,680
she's pulling stems out on a weekly

1168
00:41:10,639 --> 00:41:15,039
basis and what she's going to be doing

1169
00:41:12,679 --> 00:41:16,598
there is she's going to be decorticating

1170
00:41:15,039 --> 00:41:18,800
them and looking at how easy it is to

1171
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:20,400
decorticate Decor ability and then we're

1172
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:23,119
going to look at the chemical makeup of

1173
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:24,639
the stems so pectin ligant hemicellulose

1174
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:28,200
excuse me so on and so forth and look at

1175
00:41:24,639 --> 00:41:29,598
the fiber quality um and this is kind of

1176
00:41:28,199 --> 00:41:31,559
what it looks like so we took pictures

1177
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:33,480
throughout this process and you know you

1178
00:41:31,559 --> 00:41:35,119
go from Green all the way to this

1179
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:37,240
grayish and then you get these black

1180
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:39,960
splotches on it and so on and so forth

1181
00:41:37,239 --> 00:41:42,279
um and you know the thing is we're not

1182
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:43,599
going to say all hemp needs to be

1183
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:44,839
readded at three weeks that's not the

1184
00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:46,800
purpose of this project because that's

1185
00:41:44,838 --> 00:41:48,559
not how reading works uh instead we want

1186
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:51,200
to understand the temporal effects of

1187
00:41:48,559 --> 00:41:54,000
reading but also understand what else uh

1188
00:41:51,199 --> 00:41:55,480
really drives reading and so one aspect

1189
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,960
that we're looking at is color

1190
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:59,159
traditionally if if you look back most

1191
00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:01,639
folks base spreading off of color of

1192
00:41:59,159 --> 00:42:03,318
stem and so what we're looking at here

1193
00:42:01,639 --> 00:42:05,000
are uh the stems that she pulled out of

1194
00:42:03,318 --> 00:42:07,239
the field and they're color so we use a

1195
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:09,000
Colorimeter and what that does is it it

1196
00:42:07,239 --> 00:42:11,479
measures the color of an object and it

1197
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:13,480
converts color to basically a

1198
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:17,199
quantitative value so numbers that we

1199
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:18,480
can then analyze and so um the end goal

1200
00:42:17,199 --> 00:42:20,919
is we're going to be taking all of these

1201
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:23,960
different data from environmental data

1202
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:26,720
to color to detic ability to all of

1203
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:28,240
these other you know uh stem chemistries

1204
00:42:26,719 --> 00:42:30,039
put that into machine Le learning

1205
00:42:28,239 --> 00:42:33,959
algorithms and understand what are the

1206
00:42:30,039 --> 00:42:36,318
key drivers and then can we use those to

1207
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:38,400
predict ready and that's kind of further

1208
00:42:36,318 --> 00:42:40,558
down the line right but the idea is we

1209
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:42,200
know which are say the top three can we

1210
00:42:40,559 --> 00:42:43,640
measure those when we Harvest and then

1211
00:42:42,199 --> 00:42:45,318
use that algorithm to tell us when to

1212
00:42:43,639 --> 00:42:47,519
pull the the crop out of the field and

1213
00:42:45,318 --> 00:42:51,480
that's kind of a few years down the

1214
00:42:47,519 --> 00:42:53,960
line so um I'm a minute late but I

1215
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:56,280
wanted to end by uh first introducing

1216
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:57,400
and acknowledging someone I have an

1217
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:58,599
amazing team you've already seen a lot

1218
00:42:57,400 --> 00:43:00,720
of the hard work that they do but I have

1219
00:42:58,599 --> 00:43:02,000
an incredible technician her name is

1220
00:43:00,719 --> 00:43:03,879
Shannon Enrique as you know she's

1221
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,440
pictured here and I don't know if you

1222
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:06,960
could tell but Shannon has a little baby

1223
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:08,679
bump in this picture so she was working

1224
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:10,119
in the field this summer even though we

1225
00:43:08,679 --> 00:43:11,960
told her she should take it easy she

1226
00:43:10,119 --> 00:43:13,559
recently had her baby in the fall but

1227
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:16,679
this program is nothing without Shannon

1228
00:43:13,559 --> 00:43:18,720
and she does a tremendous job uh and we

1229
00:43:16,679 --> 00:43:21,639
are thrilled for her and her her her

1230
00:43:18,719 --> 00:43:24,598
newborn um and uh we are so thankful for

1231
00:43:21,639 --> 00:43:27,239
the hard work that she does um and I

1232
00:43:24,599 --> 00:43:29,640
also want to thank the rest of my and I

1233
00:43:27,239 --> 00:43:31,519
will end there and I am happy to take on

1234
00:43:29,639 --> 00:43:34,358
questions but the last thing I will do

1235
00:43:31,519 --> 00:43:37,039
is um just give you all an open

1236
00:43:34,358 --> 00:43:39,159
invitation we love having people down um

1237
00:43:37,039 --> 00:43:41,079
you know we we host field days we would

1238
00:43:39,159 --> 00:43:42,719
love to have as many people out to visit

1239
00:43:41,079 --> 00:43:43,760
with us and if you want to walk through

1240
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:45,358
the fields and look at the different

1241
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:47,680
trials we're doing we'd be more than

1242
00:43:45,358 --> 00:43:48,838
happy to to host you similarly if you

1243
00:43:47,679 --> 00:43:51,598
want to come visit our College of

1244
00:43:48,838 --> 00:43:53,400
textiles which I highly highly recommend

1245
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:55,599
I'd be more than happy to help uh

1246
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:56,519
coordinate those visits so uh with that

1247
00:43:55,599 --> 00:43:57,640
I want to thank thank the folks at

1248
00:43:56,519 --> 00:43:59,838
Cornell for for giving me this

1249
00:43:57,639 --> 00:44:02,039
opportunity and uh I'm willing to take

1250
00:43:59,838 --> 00:44:02,039
any

1251
00:44:02,599 --> 00:44:08,200
questions so I think you should be able

1252
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:10,599
to open the Q&amp;A box and look at them

1253
00:44:08,199 --> 00:44:13,399
yourself

1254
00:44:10,599 --> 00:44:15,559
yes okay

1255
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:17,480
um yeah I mean so there are some

1256
00:44:15,559 --> 00:44:19,640
questions I see that there's a question

1257
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:22,440
about the uh economic viability of hemp

1258
00:44:19,639 --> 00:44:23,558
for grain production we really don't do

1259
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:26,079
a lot of grain production in North

1260
00:44:23,559 --> 00:44:27,920
Carolina yet um that industry is not

1261
00:44:26,079 --> 00:44:29,960
evolved in our state and we also just

1262
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:31,480
don't really we've got issues with

1263
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:35,960
diseases we'll eventually get there but

1264
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:35,960
that's something I can't really answer

1265
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:41,200
um okay there was a question about uh

1266
00:44:39,559 --> 00:44:43,519
THC in Chinese varieties I think I

1267
00:44:41,199 --> 00:44:45,679
answered that one yep Aaron looks like

1268
00:44:43,519 --> 00:44:49,400
you jumped the gun

1269
00:44:45,679 --> 00:44:51,440
um okay Tomas what culture artist would

1270
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:53,720
you recommend for latitudes between 40

1271
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:54,960
and 32 degrees south which correspond to

1272
00:44:53,719 --> 00:44:57,959
the center of

1273
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:57,960
Argentina

1274
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:06,319
um umaa Yuma Han and fiber 2 would you

1275
00:45:02,599 --> 00:45:08,760
uh okay yeah so uh Tomas the question

1276
00:45:06,318 --> 00:45:11,079
about varieties that picture that I I

1277
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:13,319
showed you of Gary syes standing in that

1278
00:45:11,079 --> 00:45:16,039
field from hemp grower magazine that

1279
00:45:13,318 --> 00:45:18,639
variety I'm pretty sure was Bea brazis

1280
00:45:16,039 --> 00:45:20,199
or beab as people like to call it and

1281
00:45:18,639 --> 00:45:22,199
it's a great grain variety and I've seen

1282
00:45:20,199 --> 00:45:24,960
some people farther north do dual Market

1283
00:45:22,199 --> 00:45:26,759
or dual purpose but for our environment

1284
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:28,400
and our day lengths it cannot be used

1285
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:31,960
for fiber simply because of the the

1286
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:33,920
season so um I would say start off with

1287
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:35,519
those Chinese varieties keep an eye out

1288
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:37,200
for what's being produced and developed

1289
00:45:35,519 --> 00:45:39,639
in the United States whether it's from

1290
00:45:37,199 --> 00:45:41,000
Larry's program but others uh within the

1291
00:45:39,639 --> 00:45:42,480
us that are we're seeing a lot more

1292
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:46,480
breeding efforts around fiber for

1293
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:47,559
different latitudes um and when in doubt

1294
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:49,480
what I always tell folks that are

1295
00:45:47,559 --> 00:45:52,319
farming if you're ever trying anything

1296
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:53,519
new start small and never invest more

1297
00:45:52,318 --> 00:45:55,400
than you're willing to lose right

1298
00:45:53,519 --> 00:45:57,318
because you know it may not be the right

1299
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:59,440
variety or or things happen and so you

1300
00:45:57,318 --> 00:46:01,599
know if you get some be braisy try a

1301
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:05,519
small plot worth you know and obviously

1302
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:07,440
that's um um it's subjective right small

1303
00:46:05,519 --> 00:46:08,639
could be a quarter of an acre to one

1304
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:11,599
person or it could be 10 acres for

1305
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:13,279
someone else but start small I think

1306
00:46:11,599 --> 00:46:14,640
that in terms of daylength sensitivity

1307
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:17,519
those Chinese varieties should do well

1308
00:46:14,639 --> 00:46:18,920
for you but know too that even within

1309
00:46:17,519 --> 00:46:20,960
those there's differences when it comes

1310
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:22,200
to daylength uh sensitivity in that

1311
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:24,800
critical photo

1312
00:46:22,199 --> 00:46:26,960
period

1313
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:29,359
um

1314
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:31,519
okay uh TL asked are you planning on

1315
00:46:29,358 --> 00:46:33,759
evaluating the hemp spectral signature

1316
00:46:31,519 --> 00:46:36,239
for decortication trials that's a great

1317
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:38,359
question so we're we're currently doing

1318
00:46:36,239 --> 00:46:40,558
RGB um and that's what I I showed

1319
00:46:38,358 --> 00:46:43,440
earlier and we are going to be looking

1320
00:46:40,559 --> 00:46:46,680
at using multispectral Imaging as well

1321
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:48,920
um multispec is a little bit challenging

1322
00:46:46,679 --> 00:46:51,279
um based both on the amount of data you

1323
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:54,000
generate but then also the applicability

1324
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:55,920
of that data and how good those uh

1325
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:57,559
machine learning algorithms are but but

1326
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:59,440
we will be looking at that um because

1327
00:46:57,559 --> 00:47:01,440
it's really frankly just a matter of

1328
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:03,639
taking a picture quote unquote and then

1329
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:06,720
um having the computing power to analyze

1330
00:47:03,639 --> 00:47:08,639
that um Michael uh asked if the slide

1331
00:47:06,719 --> 00:47:10,078
presentation will be available I can

1332
00:47:08,639 --> 00:47:11,199
make some of the slides available but

1333
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:13,559
some with the data because they're

1334
00:47:11,199 --> 00:47:15,199
preliminary I can't um but Michael

1335
00:47:13,559 --> 00:47:16,440
please reach out to me um if there's

1336
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:18,239
specific information that you'd like I'd

1337
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:21,800
be more than happy to to get it to

1338
00:47:18,239 --> 00:47:25,159
you um is hemp susceptible to hop latent

1339
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:26,559
virus I don't know um one of the things

1340
00:47:25,159 --> 00:47:30,358
that I've seen with our fiber hemp

1341
00:47:26,559 --> 00:47:32,119
trials um in general is fortunately

1342
00:47:30,358 --> 00:47:34,119
we've not seen a lot of disease or

1343
00:47:32,119 --> 00:47:36,000
insect pest damage now that's not to say

1344
00:47:34,119 --> 00:47:38,680
that we don't see insect or disease pest

1345
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:41,400
damage in hemp in North Carolina in our

1346
00:47:38,679 --> 00:47:42,960
canabo or floral hemp corn wors will

1347
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:45,240
devastate a crop and there are also

1348
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:46,599
types of uh uh fungal pathogens that

1349
00:47:45,239 --> 00:47:47,838
will devastate a crop but since we're

1350
00:47:46,599 --> 00:47:50,640
not letting this go to flower we don't

1351
00:47:47,838 --> 00:47:53,039
see a lot of those issues the one issue

1352
00:47:50,639 --> 00:47:56,039
that I have seen in certain Fields is

1353
00:47:53,039 --> 00:47:57,960
sclerotinia soil born disease very Comm

1354
00:47:56,039 --> 00:48:00,599
in you know some commodity production

1355
00:47:57,960 --> 00:48:03,000
systems um and we can see it affect

1356
00:48:00,599 --> 00:48:04,838
fiber hm fortunately we haven't seen it

1357
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:07,159
on a widespread level but it is

1358
00:48:04,838 --> 00:48:08,719
something to be um aware of especially

1359
00:48:07,159 --> 00:48:10,039
if you're going into Fields where you

1360
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:14,598
know that you're you you've had a

1361
00:48:10,039 --> 00:48:17,039
history of that um uh

1362
00:48:14,599 --> 00:48:19,318
disease okay Michael you asked a great

1363
00:48:17,039 --> 00:48:21,239
question can the fibers be spun on Mach

1364
00:48:19,318 --> 00:48:23,838
Machinery that you can spin cotton on

1365
00:48:21,239 --> 00:48:25,799
the short answer is no um this is a a

1366
00:48:23,838 --> 00:48:27,719
big challenge that the industry has the

1367
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:29,839
reason I say no is that fiber hemp

1368
00:48:27,719 --> 00:48:32,598
fibers are much longer than cotton

1369
00:48:29,838 --> 00:48:35,358
fibers and so that's why what's

1370
00:48:32,599 --> 00:48:38,200
traditionally done at least in the US is

1371
00:48:35,358 --> 00:48:40,119
cotton isation all cotton is is cutting

1372
00:48:38,199 --> 00:48:43,239
fiber hemp fibers down so that they can

1373
00:48:40,119 --> 00:48:45,280
be spun on Cotton equipment now in other

1374
00:48:43,239 --> 00:48:47,759
countries like in China they have other

1375
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:49,240
spinning uh equipment uh like wet

1376
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:50,839
spinning and so on where you don't have

1377
00:48:49,239 --> 00:48:52,759
to do that in fact some of the folks in

1378
00:48:50,838 --> 00:48:55,239
our College of textiles are uh

1379
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:57,000
purchasing some large scale um spinning

1380
00:48:55,239 --> 00:48:59,519
equipment that is specifically built for

1381
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:01,559
spinning of long staple fiber so that we

1382
00:48:59,519 --> 00:49:03,880
don't have to Cotton it but when you

1383
00:49:01,559 --> 00:49:06,240
look across the nation we are built on

1384
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:07,599
Cotton proc excuse me cotton processing

1385
00:49:06,239 --> 00:49:08,798
so for the time being if we're going to

1386
00:49:07,599 --> 00:49:10,960
use that equipment it's going to have to

1387
00:49:08,798 --> 00:49:10,960
be

1388
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:16,640
cottoned are there any fiber processing

1389
00:49:14,159 --> 00:49:19,000
in New York I can't answer that I don't

1390
00:49:16,639 --> 00:49:22,759
know um I think that there's a lot of

1391
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:24,599
movement in New York for more um I hate

1392
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:26,040
to say industrial applications but more

1393
00:49:24,599 --> 00:49:30,599
things like hemp

1394
00:49:26,039 --> 00:49:33,000
or um uh construction and and and that

1395
00:49:30,599 --> 00:49:34,760
type of application but I'm not sure

1396
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:36,318
Larry smart would be a great person to

1397
00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:38,520
ask about

1398
00:49:36,318 --> 00:49:41,239
that what varieties were used in our

1399
00:49:38,519 --> 00:49:43,159
nitrogen and density study we used Yuma

1400
00:49:41,239 --> 00:49:45,719
um cond hemp the company that we got the

1401
00:49:43,159 --> 00:49:46,598
seed from uh is just selling Yuma

1402
00:49:45,719 --> 00:49:48,759
they're not doing any of the numbered

1403
00:49:46,599 --> 00:49:50,720
lines now it's just Yuma um and so

1404
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:53,680
that's what we are using uh for the time

1405
00:49:50,719 --> 00:49:56,078
being um until we get some other

1406
00:49:53,679 --> 00:49:57,919
varieties that work well in our

1407
00:49:56,079 --> 00:49:59,640
uh uh

1408
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:02,559
latitude what are we doing with the

1409
00:49:59,639 --> 00:50:05,118
herds Charles that's a great question um

1410
00:50:02,559 --> 00:50:07,040
so right now we are more or less just

1411
00:50:05,119 --> 00:50:08,400
giving it away to other researchers you

1412
00:50:07,039 --> 00:50:10,239
know like in our College of textiles

1413
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:12,200
that are looking at other ways to

1414
00:50:10,239 --> 00:50:15,399
valorize herd whether it's pulping and

1415
00:50:12,199 --> 00:50:17,000
making um packaging or paper I had a

1416
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:19,039
really interesting really interesting

1417
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:21,599
conversation with a researcher in our

1418
00:50:19,039 --> 00:50:24,440
bio andag engineering he says he thinks

1419
00:50:21,599 --> 00:50:26,599
he has a microb that can digest it and

1420
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:28,798
we can make a form of whis out of it

1421
00:50:26,599 --> 00:50:31,760
which will either be really cool or

1422
00:50:28,798 --> 00:50:32,838
really disgusting I don't know um but I

1423
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:34,480
think it would be pretty cool I will

1424
00:50:32,838 --> 00:50:36,960
tell you this I will not be the first

1425
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:39,199
person to try it because um it just

1426
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:40,960
sounds sounds dangerous but there are

1427
00:50:39,199 --> 00:50:44,519
folks that are working on herd uh

1428
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:46,280
processing here um but uh admittedly in

1429
00:50:44,519 --> 00:50:48,358
North Carolina the industry seems to be

1430
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:50,359
much more geared towards Bast production

1431
00:50:48,358 --> 00:50:53,358
for the time being but the other thing

1432
00:50:50,358 --> 00:50:56,119
to note about fiber hemp is that bass

1433
00:50:53,358 --> 00:50:57,558
production alone will I don't think

1434
00:50:56,119 --> 00:51:00,440
that's going to be enough for a farmer

1435
00:50:57,559 --> 00:51:01,839
when we talk about profit there there's

1436
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:03,599
plenty we can do with herd and farmers

1437
00:51:01,838 --> 00:51:06,480
are going to need to be able to benefit

1438
00:51:03,599 --> 00:51:09,200
from The Profit they can generate from

1439
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:09,199
the herd as

1440
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:17,039
well Thomas you asked a great question

1441
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:18,880
about turning the hemp yes so in our

1442
00:51:17,039 --> 00:51:20,920
reading study and I'm I'm I'm glad you

1443
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:22,880
brought this up I didn't mention this

1444
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:24,318
but at least for the bundles of hemp

1445
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:26,440
that we were pulling out of the field

1446
00:51:24,318 --> 00:51:28,239
for analysis asy was going in and

1447
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:29,960
turning them because that's something

1448
00:51:28,239 --> 00:51:33,239
that we do in general to get good even

1449
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:35,199
reading um you can leave them in the

1450
00:51:33,239 --> 00:51:36,519
field and not turn them but certainly if

1451
00:51:35,199 --> 00:51:38,318
you want better reading and faster

1452
00:51:36,519 --> 00:51:39,920
reading turning is ideal and so we are

1453
00:51:38,318 --> 00:51:44,798
doing

1454
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:46,000
that um share my contact uh Adriano I

1455
00:51:44,798 --> 00:51:47,838
hope I'm pronouncing that correctly my

1456
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:51,798
contact information

1457
00:51:47,838 --> 00:51:53,880
is I will put it in the webinar chat at

1458
00:51:51,798 --> 00:51:55,960
least my email

1459
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:57,318
address I know I'm running through these

1460
00:51:55,960 --> 00:51:58,960
quickly but there's a there's a bunch of

1461
00:51:57,318 --> 00:52:00,469
questions but he you can cut me off

1462
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:03,720
whenever you

1463
00:52:00,469 --> 00:52:03,719
[Music]

1464
00:52:07,199 --> 00:52:12,759
want any publication on the ranges of

1465
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:14,520
cellulose and ligant content uh Joan yes

1466
00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:17,920
there there's actually a lot of research

1467
00:52:14,519 --> 00:52:20,318
out there that has Quantified cellulose

1468
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:22,440
and hemicellulose and Lan in a lot of

1469
00:52:20,318 --> 00:52:24,558
feed stocks often it when you look in

1470
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:25,798
the literature it may not necessarily be

1471
00:52:24,559 --> 00:52:27,680
a paper on

1472
00:52:25,798 --> 00:52:29,199
fiber production but it's just general

1473
00:52:27,679 --> 00:52:33,199
feed stock so when they're looking at

1474
00:52:29,199 --> 00:52:37,679
like using fiber hemp for biochar or

1475
00:52:33,199 --> 00:52:38,919
digesting for um um biofuels those are

1476
00:52:37,679 --> 00:52:41,358
the papers where you'll see that

1477
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:43,599
information but there are a few other um

1478
00:52:41,358 --> 00:52:45,159
papers that I've seen that are fiber

1479
00:52:43,599 --> 00:52:47,240
specific that do also look in the

1480
00:52:45,159 --> 00:52:50,039
cellulous content or the ligant content

1481
00:52:47,239 --> 00:52:53,399
and so on

1482
00:52:50,039 --> 00:52:55,039
um Louise have you seen any effects on

1483
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:57,039
the end rates on reading time and

1484
00:52:55,039 --> 00:52:58,920
process processibility luxurious an

1485
00:52:57,039 --> 00:53:01,599
uptake can lead to longer writing times

1486
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:04,519
that's super interesting Lise um we

1487
00:53:01,599 --> 00:53:07,559
didn't look at that in our nitrogen rate

1488
00:53:04,519 --> 00:53:08,759
trial but because you brought that up

1489
00:53:07,559 --> 00:53:11,400
I'm going to talk to Ashley about that

1490
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:14,319
that would be really interesting um hemp

1491
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:16,960
certainly will likely do a luxury

1492
00:53:14,318 --> 00:53:18,639
consumption of nitrogen um we don't

1493
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:20,880
really think it fiber hemp at least for

1494
00:53:18,639 --> 00:53:22,078
for this purpose requires that much we

1495
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:24,039
think it's probably going to be

1496
00:53:22,079 --> 00:53:26,039
somewhere around 100 to 150 pounds per

1497
00:53:24,039 --> 00:53:29,000
acre maybe less

1498
00:53:26,039 --> 00:53:32,279
um but um that's a really interesting

1499
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:34,280
point about um that luxury consumption

1500
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:37,559
what its effects on on reading so thank

1501
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:37,559
you Louise I'm gonna look into that

1502
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:40,880
one

1503
00:53:41,159 --> 00:53:46,199
um so there's another question in the in

1504
00:53:44,199 --> 00:53:48,118
the webinar chat and I'm going back and

1505
00:53:46,199 --> 00:53:50,759
forth what is the performance difference

1506
00:53:48,119 --> 00:53:54,559
between dual purpose and fiber only

1507
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:56,200
genetics and the the the main thing here

1508
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:58,000
to understand is is that if you're going

1509
00:53:56,199 --> 00:53:59,719
for Dual Purpose that means I'm letting

1510
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:01,519
my plant go to full maturity or at least

1511
00:53:59,719 --> 00:54:02,879
to the point where I can Harvest seed

1512
00:54:01,519 --> 00:54:05,318
and so that means that it's likely going

1513
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:06,680
to be hard harder to process that stem

1514
00:54:05,318 --> 00:54:08,519
there's going to be more ligant in the

1515
00:54:06,679 --> 00:54:10,519
stem there's going to be more secondary

1516
00:54:08,519 --> 00:54:12,719
fiber in the stem and the fibers will

1517
00:54:10,519 --> 00:54:14,400
likely be thicker in general right when

1518
00:54:12,719 --> 00:54:17,838
we go back to that the morphology of the

1519
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:20,480
fibers and so that material may not the

1520
00:54:17,838 --> 00:54:23,880
fibers I should say may not necessarily

1521
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:26,318
be the best for say like a like a

1522
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:31,480
apparel a shirt or some other type of

1523
00:54:26,318 --> 00:54:32,599
texile application um but the other side

1524
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:35,199
of it is in a dual purpose you're

1525
00:54:32,599 --> 00:54:37,680
getting grain as well uh and admittedly

1526
00:54:35,199 --> 00:54:38,919
I'm quite excited about Dual Purpose um

1527
00:54:37,679 --> 00:54:41,000
you know it's going to require a lot

1528
00:54:38,920 --> 00:54:42,680
from Machinery investment to harvest

1529
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:46,440
that but I think that's another way for

1530
00:54:42,679 --> 00:54:49,440
firms to really maximize yield and

1531
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:49,440
profit

1532
00:54:52,039 --> 00:54:58,558
um oh Lord so Maro your question on

1533
00:54:56,159 --> 00:55:00,159
business models I'm an agronomist I'm

1534
00:54:58,559 --> 00:55:02,400
not going to answer questions on on

1535
00:55:00,159 --> 00:55:04,838
business models I apologize um I'm just

1536
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:07,160
not the right person I can certainly um

1537
00:55:04,838 --> 00:55:10,920
um put you in touch with folks that are

1538
00:55:07,159 --> 00:55:12,399
that handle more of the economics um but

1539
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:14,798
you know I think one one thing I will

1540
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:16,280
tell you in general about the industry

1541
00:55:14,798 --> 00:55:19,280
is that we always have this chicken and

1542
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:21,680
egg issue where you have companies that

1543
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:23,039
want the product but they're unwilling

1544
00:55:21,679 --> 00:55:24,279
to say invest in processing

1545
00:55:23,039 --> 00:55:25,559
infrastructure because they don't see

1546
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:26,720
people growing it

1547
00:55:25,559 --> 00:55:28,400
and then you've got Farmers that want to

1548
00:55:26,719 --> 00:55:30,000
grow it but they're not going to grow it

1549
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:33,519
because there's nowhere to get it

1550
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:34,960
processed and what what is allowing I

1551
00:55:33,519 --> 00:55:36,798
think the industry in North Carolina to

1552
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:39,559
move quickly I shouldn't say quickly but

1553
00:55:36,798 --> 00:55:42,239
move at a faster pace is that we are

1554
00:55:39,559 --> 00:55:44,280
seeing more processors pop up if you

1555
00:55:42,239 --> 00:55:46,318
don't have processing capabilities where

1556
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:48,960
you are it's going to be very hard to

1557
00:55:46,318 --> 00:55:51,199
get this crop off the ground so to speak

1558
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:52,559
this industry off the ground um and so I

1559
00:55:51,199 --> 00:55:55,038
think you really want to look into

1560
00:55:52,559 --> 00:55:56,680
processing but also understanding where

1561
00:55:55,039 --> 00:55:58,599
where is the demand who's going to buy

1562
00:55:56,679 --> 00:56:01,318
this right even if I build the process

1563
00:55:58,599 --> 00:56:06,359
this can process hundreds of Acres

1564
00:56:01,318 --> 00:56:09,199
thousands of Acres who's going to buy it

1565
00:56:06,358 --> 00:56:13,318
um

1566
00:56:09,199 --> 00:56:14,719
okay let's see oh Leo uh can you discuss

1567
00:56:13,318 --> 00:56:17,239
the benefits mentioned in regards to

1568
00:56:14,719 --> 00:56:18,959
clothing textile made from hemp okay

1569
00:56:17,239 --> 00:56:20,798
that's a great question and I will say

1570
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:23,480
that I'm going to venture into a realm

1571
00:56:20,798 --> 00:56:26,000
where I I know it enough to be dangerous

1572
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:28,280
but I'm no textile expt

1573
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:30,119
um one of the things that makes the hemp

1574
00:56:28,280 --> 00:56:32,920
from fiber really great is is its

1575
00:56:30,119 --> 00:56:36,280
durability it is incredibly strong uh

1576
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:38,200
and so where where hemp fits in is when

1577
00:56:36,280 --> 00:56:39,760
you think about Denim and you think

1578
00:56:38,199 --> 00:56:42,318
about workware like patagon has got

1579
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:45,079
their workware line um anything that is

1580
00:56:42,318 --> 00:56:47,960
going to be under a lot of abrasion but

1581
00:56:45,079 --> 00:56:52,200
still needs to hold its shape hemp is

1582
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:53,599
highly durable that said I highly doubt

1583
00:56:52,199 --> 00:56:56,199
we will ever get to a point where you're

1584
00:56:53,599 --> 00:56:58,200
seeing 100% hand shirts and other things

1585
00:56:56,199 --> 00:57:00,318
like that because it doesn't wear like

1586
00:56:58,199 --> 00:57:02,199
cotton it's not as soft as cotton um

1587
00:57:00,318 --> 00:57:04,519
we're often seeing a lot of cotton hemp

1588
00:57:02,199 --> 00:57:06,558
Blends so you get the best of both

1589
00:57:04,519 --> 00:57:08,400
worlds the other thing that that the

1590
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:11,839
textile industry gets really excited

1591
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:13,880
about is that they see the fibers from

1592
00:57:11,838 --> 00:57:15,838
fiber hemp being a replacement for a lot

1593
00:57:13,880 --> 00:57:18,480
of the synthetics that are put in a

1594
00:57:15,838 --> 00:57:21,519
cotton synthetic blend fill in the blank

1595
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:23,280
shirt sock whatever and there it's a

1596
00:57:21,519 --> 00:57:24,880
really cool sustainability store we're

1597
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:27,000
getting rid of these synthetics that are

1598
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:28,480
generated from Oil we're working with

1599
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:30,440
farmers who are growing the cotton and

1600
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:32,280
the fiber hm right and so there's

1601
00:57:30,440 --> 00:57:34,200
there's a much better story and you know

1602
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:37,440
it's something that I I think uh I would

1603
00:57:34,199 --> 00:57:39,399
love to wear um and there's also a

1604
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:40,519
number of other benefits um some of our

1605
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:42,400
researchers are working with the

1606
00:57:40,519 --> 00:57:45,400
military and looking at garments that

1607
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:47,318
have fiber hemp in them uh for folks

1608
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:49,480
that are uh in the Navy or are going to

1609
00:57:47,318 --> 00:57:52,358
be in and out of water regularly because

1610
00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:54,119
hemp holds it shape much better in water

1611
00:57:52,358 --> 00:57:56,598
um and so there are a number of other

1612
00:57:54,119 --> 00:58:00,680
benefits there um but it is it is quite

1613
00:57:56,599 --> 00:58:00,680
a unique and breathable uh

1614
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:06,680
fiber uh philli can you talk more about

1615
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:09,400
your decortication efforts with your

1616
00:58:06,679 --> 00:58:12,440
partners how was that relationship

1617
00:58:09,400 --> 00:58:15,119
developed um I don't really understand

1618
00:58:12,440 --> 00:58:18,318
the question Phillip

1619
00:58:15,119 --> 00:58:20,440
um I if you're talking about the

1620
00:58:18,318 --> 00:58:22,318
companies they have basically just been

1621
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:24,960
popping up they they've seen that

1622
00:58:22,318 --> 00:58:29,038
there's a need for it and that it wasn't

1623
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:31,960
being met and they're business folks so

1624
00:58:29,039 --> 00:58:34,280
they're really trying to get in you know

1625
00:58:31,960 --> 00:58:37,159
uh get in as soon as they

1626
00:58:34,280 --> 00:58:39,559
can what I really appreciate so far

1627
00:58:37,159 --> 00:58:41,440
about the decorators that that that I've

1628
00:58:39,559 --> 00:58:43,519
been working with here in North Carolina

1629
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:44,720
is that they understand that this is a

1630
00:58:43,519 --> 00:58:46,719
work in progress and they understand

1631
00:58:44,719 --> 00:58:47,719
that this is a new crop and they

1632
00:58:46,719 --> 00:58:50,558
understand that farmers are going to

1633
00:58:47,719 --> 00:58:52,519
have challenges and it's not just purely

1634
00:58:50,559 --> 00:58:54,760
business right on so for example some of

1635
00:58:52,519 --> 00:58:56,400
the decorators right now are paying more

1636
00:58:54,760 --> 00:59:00,079
or less a flat fee for Farmers for a

1637
00:58:56,400 --> 00:59:01,639
specific acreage regardless of yields um

1638
00:59:00,079 --> 00:59:03,559
they they understand that it's

1639
00:59:01,639 --> 00:59:05,679
eventually it will go to much more of a

1640
00:59:03,559 --> 00:59:08,200
traditional you know yield quality

1641
00:59:05,679 --> 00:59:10,239
system but I appreciate their

1642
00:59:08,199 --> 00:59:12,199
willingness to work with the farmer and

1643
00:59:10,239 --> 00:59:14,279
to kind of help them along the way as

1644
00:59:12,199 --> 00:59:16,598
this industry develops I'm not sure if

1645
00:59:14,280 --> 00:59:19,079
that's the question you you meant to ask

1646
00:59:16,599 --> 00:59:21,680
but um or or if that's the answer you

1647
00:59:19,079 --> 00:59:23,760
wanted but but um I could

1648
00:59:21,679 --> 00:59:26,639
certainly answer when you come to North

1649
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:26,640
Carolina which I think you want

1650
00:59:26,920 --> 00:59:32,960
um okay uh to what extent if any is the

1651
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:34,358
is Congress FDA stagnation in regulating

1652
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:36,358
cannabinoids impacting the growth of

1653
00:59:34,358 --> 00:59:40,358
fiber hemp industry in North Carolina

1654
00:59:36,358 --> 00:59:41,639
admittedly not that much um you know it

1655
00:59:40,358 --> 00:59:44,199
is a concern right with those Chinese

1656
00:59:41,639 --> 00:59:46,239
varieties going hot but that has not

1657
00:59:44,199 --> 00:59:48,199
been what's limiting folks mainly it's

1658
00:59:46,239 --> 00:59:51,199
just been industry pull and getting

1659
00:59:48,199 --> 00:59:55,159
these processors up to speed um the

1660
00:59:51,199 --> 00:59:58,960
cannaboid side is certainly a concern

1661
00:59:55,159 --> 01:00:01,000
um but it's not limiting producers it's

1662
00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:04,679
not keeping producers out I will say

1663
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:06,119
though that the burden of paperwork and

1664
01:00:04,679 --> 01:00:07,838
having to get an FBI background check

1665
01:00:06,119 --> 01:00:09,920
and all of that to get a license

1666
01:00:07,838 --> 01:00:12,199
certainly does keep Farmers from getting

1667
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:13,599
in in hemp that may haven't before and

1668
01:00:12,199 --> 01:00:15,838
that's not all of them but some of them

1669
01:00:13,599 --> 01:00:18,000
just don't want to do it and frankly I I

1670
01:00:15,838 --> 01:00:19,558
don't blame them

1671
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:22,159
um

1672
01:00:19,559 --> 01:00:25,680
so I guess in that regard that's where

1673
01:00:22,159 --> 01:00:27,798
some of that that governmental burden is

1674
01:00:25,679 --> 01:00:29,879
impacting um production and the adoption

1675
01:00:27,798 --> 01:00:34,838
of this

1676
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:38,280
crop okay David thank you so much uh for

1677
01:00:34,838 --> 01:00:42,279
joining us and um it's now a little bit

1678
01:00:38,280 --> 01:00:44,839
past two o'clock but um you answered so

1679
01:00:42,280 --> 01:00:46,119
many questions that was really helpful I

1680
01:00:44,838 --> 01:00:48,880
think

1681
01:00:46,119 --> 01:00:51,119
um you know we'll be getting a recording

1682
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:53,358
of all the hemp webinar talks up onto

1683
01:00:51,119 --> 01:00:56,640
the Cornell sips YouTube page in the

1684
01:00:53,358 --> 01:00:58,038
near future and um so people can rewatch

1685
01:00:56,639 --> 01:00:59,598
this if they're interested or share it

1686
01:00:58,039 --> 01:01:01,520
with other people they know would be

1687
01:00:59,599 --> 01:01:03,240
interested um but for now I think we're

1688
01:01:01,519 --> 01:01:05,000
going to say goodbye until two weeks

1689
