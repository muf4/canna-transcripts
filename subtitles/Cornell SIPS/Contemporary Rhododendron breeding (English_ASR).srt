1
00:00:01,159 --> 00:00:04,799
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:11,679
University all right well it's such a

3
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:15,400
nice spring day out there and uh so I

4
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:20,278
want to reward you for staying inside

5
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:24,198
with me uh with some beautiful spring

6
00:00:20,278 --> 00:00:26,719
flowers I'm going to talk about uh Ro

7
00:00:24,199 --> 00:00:28,640
redend project that I've been working on

8
00:00:26,719 --> 00:00:30,239
it's been a long-term project but that's

9
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:34,719
Woody plants for you they tend to be

10
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:38,519
long term uh the title is just meant to

11
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:40,960
convey uh my effort to really rejuvenate

12
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:42,760
a plant which has been popular for a

13
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:45,280
long time in gardens but has sort of

14
00:00:42,759 --> 00:00:48,359
languished in in Commerce and sort of

15
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:51,160
has lost popularity in the public

16
00:00:48,359 --> 00:00:53,759
imagination it's not for lack of of

17
00:00:51,159 --> 00:00:55,640
Aesthetics it's an incredibly beautiful

18
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:58,119
plant and every new variety that comes

19
00:00:55,640 --> 00:01:00,600
out seems more stunning than the one

20
00:00:58,119 --> 00:01:02,439
before uh the difficulty

21
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:04,599
uh the problem really lies with the

22
00:01:02,439 --> 00:01:06,359
culture of the plant it's biology it's

23
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:10,000
very difficult to

24
00:01:06,359 --> 00:01:11,599
grow unless you're you know willing to a

25
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,359
knowledgeable Gardener that's willing to

26
00:01:11,599 --> 00:01:15,879
make the effort to do so so for really

27
00:01:14,359 --> 00:01:19,239
the vast majority of the gardening

28
00:01:15,879 --> 00:01:21,118
public these are plants uh that fail in

29
00:01:19,239 --> 00:01:23,519
the garden we call them in our cynical

30
00:01:21,118 --> 00:01:25,840
moments bials you buy them in bloom at

31
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:28,840
the Garden Center and they die the next

32
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,840
year

33
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,359
well our depart research department at

34
00:01:32,719 --> 00:01:38,239
Holden is consists of four principal

35
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:40,879
investigators so why this uh big

36
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:43,879
investment in radad dendrons well part

37
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:46,560
of that is because of uh really it's

38
00:01:43,879 --> 00:01:48,560
happen stance it's a convergence of

39
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:51,680
like-minded people with the same

40
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:54,519
interests uh able to pull their

41
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:57,039
resources and and uh create what became

42
00:01:54,519 --> 00:01:59,920
the David G leech research station so

43
00:01:57,039 --> 00:02:00,840
David Leech was a uh influential

44
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,519
American

45
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:05,640
horticulturist president of the American

46
00:02:02,519 --> 00:02:08,118
Rance Society for many years involved

47
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:11,598
heavily with the garden Conservancy but

48
00:02:08,118 --> 00:02:13,479
also a passionate uh admirer of red

49
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:15,878
dendrons and very a world a world

50
00:02:13,479 --> 00:02:17,719
Authority really he wrote his seminal

51
00:02:15,878 --> 00:02:20,439
book called reders of the world which

52
00:02:17,719 --> 00:02:22,800
really came out in the early 60s really

53
00:02:20,439 --> 00:02:25,199
helped popularize the plant in the

54
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:28,840
American Consciousness and his niche as

55
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:30,679
a hybridizer was cold hearty hybrids so

56
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:33,959
his Target for

57
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:36,080
hardiness was zone five and in

58
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:38,000
ornamental plants the hardiness is

59
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,920
usually given for the buds the flower

60
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,280
buds that's the trait of Interest so

61
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:46,919
buds Hardy to about minus5 Fahrenheit

62
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:48,878
was was his uh threshold level and he

63
00:02:46,919 --> 00:02:50,919
created these beautiful hybrids here the

64
00:02:48,878 --> 00:02:53,000
Red Sea and the yellow

65
00:02:50,919 --> 00:02:55,199
Capistrano uh which are plants they're

66
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,639
recombinant plants you don't find those

67
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:59,479
colors in a hearty background in nature

68
00:02:57,639 --> 00:03:01,839
they're created by hybridizing different

69
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:01,840
species

70
00:03:02,039 --> 00:03:07,639
species the other answer to why roted D

71
00:03:05,318 --> 00:03:11,079
is why not they really are probably the

72
00:03:07,639 --> 00:03:13,318
most uh one of the most ornamental Woody

73
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:16,120
shrubs available in terms of the

74
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:18,119
diversity of colors these are species

75
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:21,319
most of them from Asia showing the range

76
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:27,519
of colors everything except maybe a a

77
00:03:21,318 --> 00:03:29,919
blue uh variety of types of infloresence

78
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:33,280
inflorescences tremendous variability of

79
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:36,000
Leaf morphology this is uh you have uh

80
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:39,719
low elevation tree species with leaves

81
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:42,759
that are 3 feet long up to small tiny

82
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:45,840
little small Lea Alpine plants at at

83
00:03:42,759 --> 00:03:48,878
about 18,000 ft in the in the Asian

84
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:52,158
mountains often times I'll have these uh

85
00:03:48,878 --> 00:03:54,878
kind of fuzzy undersides here different

86
00:03:52,158 --> 00:03:57,000
colors that's a it's kind of a suede

87
00:03:54,878 --> 00:03:58,639
type covering called indumentum don't

88
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,719
really know the function of it but it's

89
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:01,719
it's uh highly

90
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:08,280
Al so what I've been showing you so far

91
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:12,000
is just a slice of the total genus

92
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:15,519
renrin which worldwide consists of about

93
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,478
a thousand species and that includes

94
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:18,120
other

95
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:21,758
subgenera

96
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:24,079
um which uh are such as the Deciduous

97
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:27,199
aelas and the Evergreen aelas and the

98
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:29,758
small Leaf groad denance subgenus heanes

99
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:32,919
which is the focus of my talk are the

100
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:33,639
non-scaly Leaf large leaf rendin most of

101
00:04:32,918 --> 00:04:36,079
them

102
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:38,800
Evergreen and the center of diversity

103
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:41,198
Center of origin for this genus is

104
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:44,600
Southwest China into the Himalayas so

105
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:47,478
those solid and hatched areas areas of

106
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:50,199
extreme topographical relief uh which

107
00:04:47,478 --> 00:04:52,199
led to uh quite rapid

108
00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:55,919
speciation and then outward from that

109
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:58,240
Center you'll find instances of other

110
00:04:55,918 --> 00:05:02,198
species into Korea

111
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:04,319
Japan um Central Asia and Europe and

112
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:08,319
across the landbridge into North America

113
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:10,680
so there are a couple species on the uh

114
00:05:08,319 --> 00:05:14,038
in the eastern mountains of of North

115
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:16,959
America that uh are very useful for

116
00:05:14,038 --> 00:05:18,120
breeding cold hardiness so breeders like

117
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:22,359
David would

118
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:25,160
typically uh take a Hardy North American

119
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:28,680
species and cross it with a uh more

120
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:30,759
colorful but less hearty Asian species

121
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:33,319
and

122
00:05:30,759 --> 00:05:36,560
as a rule you can intercross quite

123
00:05:33,319 --> 00:05:38,479
freely at the subgeneric level and so

124
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:41,879
there's really no you don't have to go

125
00:05:38,478 --> 00:05:44,318
to extremes to to try to for these wide

126
00:05:41,879 --> 00:05:46,800
crosses uh and The Offspring themselves

127
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:50,360
are often fertile so hybridizers would

128
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:52,680
just cross species with species and

129
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:54,400
often times some of the the modern

130
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:56,199
varieties have as many as a dozen

131
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:58,679
different species in their

132
00:05:56,199 --> 00:06:00,639
background where you don't find renrin

133
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:04,120
is in these

134
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:07,199
uh Continental areas of Asia or the us

135
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:10,918
such as Cleveland uh and that's the

136
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:12,960
areas where of extreme heat and cold Ro

137
00:06:10,918 --> 00:06:15,120
ders like higher elevations in the

138
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:17,120
mountains or along

139
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:19,680
Maritime climates which are more

140
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:22,800
buffered uh in terms of

141
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:24,560
temperature all right well briefly uh

142
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,840
the interest in the west and renrin

143
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:30,839
really evolved out of that crazy

144
00:06:26,839 --> 00:06:32,119
Victorian uh passion for for plants um a

145
00:06:30,839 --> 00:06:34,719
lot of the

146
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:37,000
uh collections initial collections

147
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:40,720
coming into the into the West were were

148
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:44,519
in uh in England sponsored by uh landed

149
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:47,199
gentry who could fund Expeditions and in

150
00:06:44,519 --> 00:06:49,359
return they would get seed uh so really

151
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:51,960
the from the GetGo the interest was

152
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:54,319
among hobbyists enthusiasts and that has

153
00:06:51,959 --> 00:06:57,758
really continued into today's world most

154
00:06:54,319 --> 00:07:00,639
of the Breeders are are just um what I

155
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:01,960
call backyard breeders I'm definitely an

156
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:05,240
exception to the

157
00:07:01,959 --> 00:07:07,799
rule uh and some of the first hybrids

158
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:10,160
were made in England uh the Earl of

159
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:12,280
Caravan uh created some of the first

160
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:15,120
road enter hybrids and he was the U

161
00:07:12,279 --> 00:07:20,000
owner of

162
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:23,598
um it was called uh hi highest Castle

163
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,399
which you know as um down Abbey there

164
00:07:23,598 --> 00:07:28,719
you

165
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:31,079
go all right so 20 you know a century

166
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:33,840
and a half later there are over 25,000

167
00:07:31,079 --> 00:07:39,159
registered hybrids not uncommon in

168
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:39,159
popular plants like like roses let's see

169
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,120
here

170
00:07:45,158 --> 00:07:50,598
okay uh the style of breeding was was

171
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:53,478
done as pedigree breeding just like dogs

172
00:07:50,598 --> 00:07:56,240
and horses uh breeders had their

173
00:07:53,478 --> 00:07:58,318
favorite uh stud plants to use very

174
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:00,918
limited triing most things were

175
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:03,439
introduced commercially based on one

176
00:08:00,918 --> 00:08:07,478
plant at one location and the emphasis

177
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:12,879
really was on flowers above all uh and

178
00:08:07,478 --> 00:08:12,878
less on uh performance and

179
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:18,639
adaptability and that's been a problem

180
00:08:15,918 --> 00:08:21,799
in terms of general public uh use of

181
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:25,240
these plants um particularly soil issues

182
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:27,840
the requirement for acid soils pH

183
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:30,759
optimum around five and very good

184
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:32,679
drainage is required uh and that

185
00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:34,080
primarily has to do with avoidance of

186
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:36,679
root rot

187
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:40,360
disease and so many rotoden that are

188
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:42,199
planted by uh gardeners who are not

189
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:43,639
knowledgeable buying them at big box

190
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:46,640
stores and just sticking them into the

191
00:08:43,639 --> 00:08:49,480
foundation next to their down spouts uh

192
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:51,879
involves improper site selection and

193
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:54,120
lack of proper soil amendment to try to

194
00:08:51,879 --> 00:08:56,159
overcome those those restriction so

195
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:59,000
really out of that

196
00:08:56,159 --> 00:09:01,838
25,000 uh group of named hybrids there's

197
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:04,039
fewer than 20 that are important

198
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:06,040
commercially on a national have a

199
00:09:04,039 --> 00:09:07,599
national sales presence those are the

200
00:09:06,039 --> 00:09:10,000
so-called Ironclad

201
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:12,720
roadeden uh which were developed over a

202
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,759
century ago in England uh but have

203
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:17,920
proven to be very versatile and so my

204
00:09:15,759 --> 00:09:19,958
goal really is to try to expand that

205
00:09:17,919 --> 00:09:21,240
ornamental pallet and create really the

206
00:09:19,958 --> 00:09:23,518
modern

207
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:26,000
ironclads so I'm taking a collection

208
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:31,159
that David Leech created really a

209
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:32,600
50-year uh body of work that that he did

210
00:09:31,159 --> 00:09:34,759
uh that developed these highly

211
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:36,879
ornamental cold hearty plants and we're

212
00:09:34,759 --> 00:09:39,799
adding traits like root rot disease

213
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:42,759
resistance and heat tolerance to those

214
00:09:39,799 --> 00:09:45,359
with the goal of getting a plant product

215
00:09:42,759 --> 00:09:47,078
that people can grow more successfully

216
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,759
also one particularly with the addition

217
00:09:47,078 --> 00:09:51,838
of heat tolerance that will broaden the

218
00:09:48,759 --> 00:09:54,120
market renrin typically Fade Out of

219
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:58,640
culture as you go south around the Mason

220
00:09:54,120 --> 00:10:01,078
Dixon line and um as you go south the

221
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:02,360
emphasis shifts to Evergreen and

222
00:10:01,078 --> 00:10:05,239
deciduous as

223
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:07,639
alas so roted ERS are not considered to

224
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:09,519
be particularly heat tolerant and

225
00:10:07,639 --> 00:10:13,879
disease resistance and heat tolerance

226
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:15,519
are not really uh coincidental traits

227
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:17,519
our source of resistance that we're

228
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:19,519
using happens also to be quite heat

229
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:21,600
tolerant and we feel that there's

230
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:24,320
probably a functional relationship

231
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:27,680
between these two our working hypothesis

232
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:29,959
in the breeding program is that uh

233
00:10:27,679 --> 00:10:32,278
disease resistance is is important in

234
00:10:29,958 --> 00:10:36,559
warm climates because disease pressure

235
00:10:32,278 --> 00:10:36,559
increases as you get warmer and

236
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:44,920
wetter so the disease root rot disease

237
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:47,919
is caused main causal organism is phyto

238
00:10:44,919 --> 00:10:50,039
camoni which uh I will sometimes refer

239
00:10:47,919 --> 00:10:53,360
to as a fungus but truly it's not a true

240
00:10:50,039 --> 00:10:55,879
fungus it's fungus like now classified

241
00:10:53,360 --> 00:11:00,000
in the protstas

242
00:10:55,879 --> 00:11:02,159
um it's a soil pathogen when it finds a

243
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,759
susceptible host it

244
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:07,559
colonizes right behind the root cap and

245
00:11:05,759 --> 00:11:09,879
then begins to grow through the root

246
00:11:07,559 --> 00:11:12,638
system uh eventually moving up to the

247
00:11:09,879 --> 00:11:16,159
crown region you can see this section

248
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:17,440
here the the necrotic regions at that

249
00:11:16,159 --> 00:11:19,919
point it's really disrupting the

250
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,839
vascular system of the plant and you see

251
00:11:19,919 --> 00:11:24,039
this

252
00:11:20,839 --> 00:11:26,480
Wilt uh symptom that's the classtic

253
00:11:24,039 --> 00:11:28,759
indication in the choots and that's

254
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:30,360
irreversible at that point the plants uh

255
00:11:28,759 --> 00:11:35,039
is good as

256
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:38,200
Dead uh the zoospores are the Infectious

257
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:40,480
agents shown here in the lower right and

258
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:42,680
they are motile they have

259
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:44,639
fella uh they can move a little bit

260
00:11:42,679 --> 00:11:45,919
around in the soil and and under wet

261
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:48,560
conditions and so that's one of the

262
00:11:45,919 --> 00:11:52,078
reasons why drainage is so important as

263
00:11:48,559 --> 00:11:52,078
a disease avoidance

264
00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:00,278
mechanism well phop there is a problem

265
00:11:57,679 --> 00:12:03,239
for renin and many many other crops

266
00:12:00,278 --> 00:12:06,679
because it's a it's a uh it's a global

267
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:10,360
invasive it's everywhere and few native

268
00:12:06,679 --> 00:12:12,919
plants like uh many of our renin are

269
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:14,879
resistant so we early on we were looking

270
00:12:12,919 --> 00:12:17,958
for sources of resistance and when I

271
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:21,320
started there already was a report uh

272
00:12:17,958 --> 00:12:24,679
done by Pathologists at Ohio State uh in

273
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:27,480
the mid 70s and so we did another report

274
00:12:24,679 --> 00:12:29,799
in 2002 looking at more contemporary

275
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:32,000
hybrids just to do screen means and

276
00:12:29,799 --> 00:12:34,359
identify either cultivars or species

277
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:38,799
that would be useful for breeding only

278
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:41,759
6% of the hybrids prove resistant and

279
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:44,359
177% of the species out of these

280
00:12:41,759 --> 00:12:47,240
Collective studies and that's uh that

281
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:49,079
number gets even smaller when you look

282
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:52,079
for plants that are not only resistant

283
00:12:49,078 --> 00:12:53,679
but also have some measure of of cold

284
00:12:52,078 --> 00:12:55,958
hardiness which is another one of our

285
00:12:53,679 --> 00:12:55,958
key

286
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:03,639
criteria so doing resistance screens is

287
00:13:01,039 --> 00:13:06,559
is uh where these are done in control

288
00:13:03,639 --> 00:13:09,600
Greenhouse experiments where we culture

289
00:13:06,559 --> 00:13:12,599
the pathogen in the lab and then make an

290
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:14,759
inoculum and give it to the plants so

291
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:18,040
we're either doing these uh like on the

292
00:13:14,759 --> 00:13:20,240
left we're doing inoculations of single

293
00:13:18,039 --> 00:13:23,159
plants and pots that's when we're

294
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:25,680
usually trying to identify resistance

295
00:13:23,159 --> 00:13:27,838
level in specific genotypes where we

296
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:30,000
need a replicated trial or we're looking

297
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:31,760
at seedling population breeding

298
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:35,839
populations where we're screening

299
00:13:31,759 --> 00:13:37,720
genetically variable um Offspring and uh

300
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:41,279
these are done when the plants are at

301
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:41,278
about 6 months of

302
00:13:44,278 --> 00:13:50,078
age one of the key metrics that we use

303
00:13:47,078 --> 00:13:52,479
are are disease root scores or root rot

304
00:13:50,078 --> 00:13:53,399
disease scores which is a numerical

305
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:56,600
visual

306
00:13:53,399 --> 00:14:00,198
rating uh where on a scale of 1 to five

307
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:01,440
so one is a healthy root nice quite um

308
00:14:00,198 --> 00:14:04,559
fine Roots

309
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:06,639
here uh working up to a level of

310
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:09,078
intermediate level which is uh three

311
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:12,000
where you have necrotic fine Roots plus

312
00:14:09,078 --> 00:14:14,359
some of these coarse Roots here are also

313
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,639
damaged and we use pruners to kind of

314
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:18,639
cut and and inspect cross-section as we

315
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:22,519
go it's a destructive

316
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:28,039
sample uh up into the crown rot area and

317
00:14:22,519 --> 00:14:28,039
finally five which is a a dead plant

318
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:35,360
so not so it's important for a parent to

319
00:14:33,198 --> 00:14:38,919
be resistant but also for it to be able

320
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:41,560
to transmit that resistance to offspring

321
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:43,799
effectively and not all plants do this

322
00:14:41,559 --> 00:14:46,119
equally well it's based on really

323
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:47,359
breeding value which in turn is is a

324
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:49,360
measure of

325
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:51,240
heritability the resemblance that

326
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:53,720
Offspring Have to their

327
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:55,519
parents um and this is a key thing in

328
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:58,480
Woody plants especially you want a high

329
00:14:55,519 --> 00:15:00,839
heritability value which is estimated on

330
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:02,720
a scale of 0 to one uh because you want

331
00:15:00,839 --> 00:15:05,279
to make as much gain as possible in one

332
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:07,720
generation know the generation time in

333
00:15:05,278 --> 00:15:10,559
Woody plants can be long and if you can

334
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:12,519
get good Pro you make good progress in

335
00:15:10,559 --> 00:15:16,838
one generation that's that's really

336
00:15:12,519 --> 00:15:18,799
valuable So based on uh this is uh these

337
00:15:16,839 --> 00:15:23,639
are the parent scores on the scale of 1

338
00:15:18,799 --> 00:15:26,039
to five versus Offspring on the same

339
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:28,000
scale and uh we're looking at open

340
00:15:26,039 --> 00:15:30,759
pollinated offspring of all these

341
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,958
parents

342
00:15:30,759 --> 00:15:34,919
and so the heritability estimate which

343
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:38,799
is a narrow sense heritability a measure

344
00:15:34,919 --> 00:15:42,879
of additive genetic variability is 86

345
00:15:38,799 --> 00:15:44,439
which is a a satisfactorily high number

346
00:15:42,879 --> 00:15:48,838
uh that just suggests that we can make

347
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:48,839
pretty good gains in one breeding

348
00:15:51,879 --> 00:15:58,720
cycle and that value comes in line with

349
00:15:56,078 --> 00:16:01,599
some uh heritability studies down on

350
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:04,240
other Woody plants mostly uh these are

351
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:06,639
all threatened tree species where areas

352
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:08,159
from areas where pyur is actually

353
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:12,639
naturalized and is becoming an

354
00:16:08,159 --> 00:16:15,000
ecological issue eucalyptus monter Pine

355
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:18,600
European Chestnut so the values there

356
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:20,639
vary from 05 up to about 86 do you have

357
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:24,959
any similar data about prunus root

358
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:24,959
stocks in that respect I prunus I

359
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:32,958
don't ultimately through some trial and

360
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:35,519
error uh we settled on a really one

361
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:38,278
species as our foundation for resistance

362
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:39,759
breeding it's called Roden hyperm it's

363
00:16:38,278 --> 00:16:43,120
native to

364
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:45,360
Taiwan uh but it's and it it's so but

365
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:47,679
it's high enough elevation found between

366
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:49,839
1 and 2,000 MERS in the central

367
00:16:47,679 --> 00:16:51,559
mountains of Taiwan so it has some

368
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:55,600
hardiness we can grow it it's probably a

369
00:16:51,559 --> 00:16:58,958
zone six plant we can grow it outside uh

370
00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:02,639
in Ohio it did survive this winter uh

371
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:04,480
but it got took a pretty hard hit um but

372
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:07,640
it other virtue is heat Taun so this is

373
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:10,558
a one of the few large leafed Evergreen

374
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:12,280
species that will grow in the Gulf South

375
00:17:10,558 --> 00:17:14,959
in addition to those traits it has good

376
00:17:12,279 --> 00:17:19,038
ornamental traits this compact bushy

377
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:21,279
growth glossy foliage nice thick thick

378
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:24,119
leaves and it's very floriferous

379
00:17:21,279 --> 00:17:26,519
although the only comes in white uh and

380
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:27,918
the inflorescences or trusses as

381
00:17:26,519 --> 00:17:30,079
gardeners call them are a little bit

382
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:31,679
open the the

383
00:17:30,079 --> 00:17:35,319
typically the standard is for something

384
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:35,320
a little more Compact and

385
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:42,880
organized so from a B's perspective what

386
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:46,200
we're we're we're crossing this with

387
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:48,679
plants that we know have uh hardiness

388
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:50,080
have good saturated colors pinks Reds

389
00:17:48,679 --> 00:17:53,759
yellows

390
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:53,759
purples and and so

391
00:17:56,119 --> 00:18:02,759
forth so in a breeding experiments uh

392
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:05,279
again these are inoculated Greenhouse

393
00:18:02,759 --> 00:18:09,000
studies we just this just gives you a

394
00:18:05,279 --> 00:18:11,279
visual idea of of um what comes out of a

395
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,798
cross this is a susceptible cross in

396
00:18:11,279 --> 00:18:14,200
fact most of the parents we're crossing

397
00:18:12,798 --> 00:18:17,119
it with are

398
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:19,480
susceptible uh this is a variety called

399
00:18:17,119 --> 00:18:22,719
calap open pollinated so there's about

400
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:26,038
100% mortality uh this is 7 weeks after

401
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:28,798
inoculation cross with the species no

402
00:18:26,038 --> 00:18:31,359
mortality and the F1 shown here there's

403
00:18:28,798 --> 00:18:33,158
a little there are few dead seedings but

404
00:18:31,359 --> 00:18:36,879
otherwise things look pretty good so

405
00:18:33,159 --> 00:18:39,960
there's a strong resemblance of of the

406
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:41,919
first generation to the resistant parent

407
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:44,400
and you can quantify that just by doing

408
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:46,960
disease progress plots this is using

409
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:48,120
another susceptible variety yellow one

410
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:51,919
called

411
00:18:48,119 --> 00:18:55,319
Capistrano um this is the mortality rate

412
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:58,240
on the Y over days from inoculation so

413
00:18:55,319 --> 00:19:02,319
this is the um open pollinated Offspring

414
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:05,319
from cap EST Strano a fast trajectory to

415
00:19:02,319 --> 00:19:08,200
Extinction R is the hyperm resistant

416
00:19:05,319 --> 00:19:10,599
parent so it levels off at about 20%

417
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:14,440
mortality among those seedlings there

418
00:19:10,599 --> 00:19:18,158
seems to be some recombination where um

419
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:21,038
uh about 20% of The Offspring

420
00:19:18,159 --> 00:19:22,360
are susceptible rather than resistant

421
00:19:21,038 --> 00:19:26,319
and then the

422
00:19:22,359 --> 00:19:28,879
F1 plotted here which levels off and it

423
00:19:26,319 --> 00:19:30,879
tracks closely to the resistant parent

424
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:33,880
you measure the area under the disease

425
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:38,200
progress curves and just subtract and

426
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:40,840
divide and you can end up with a gain of

427
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:43,080
in this case 83% gain and resistance in

428
00:19:40,839 --> 00:19:43,079
one

429
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:49,759
generation so with some of those

430
00:19:46,839 --> 00:19:53,319
breeding experiments behind us we we set

431
00:19:49,759 --> 00:19:57,200
off to to generate large numbers of

432
00:19:53,319 --> 00:20:00,439
populations and progyny in in a in

433
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:03,840
Earnest and and uh this gives an an idea

434
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:06,440
of how we made those crosses we we

435
00:20:03,839 --> 00:20:09,199
bulked different hyperm genotypes we

436
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:11,000
didn't want to use just one accession

437
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:13,120
because we wanted to avoid the

438
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,079
possibility of inbreeding depression in

439
00:20:13,119 --> 00:20:17,599
later

440
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:20,319
generations and we'd cross those with uh

441
00:20:17,599 --> 00:20:22,918
an array of of cifi in this case this is

442
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:25,759
the red group of varieties we're looking

443
00:20:22,919 --> 00:20:29,240
for you know strong pinks or Reds out of

444
00:20:25,759 --> 00:20:33,279
this cross we also used yellow purple

445
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:34,240
whites so forth um and we grew those out

446
00:20:33,279 --> 00:20:36,240
in

447
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:38,720
quantities with the thought that we

448
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:40,519
could possibly make some of that first

449
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:42,558
generation material might be worthy of

450
00:20:40,519 --> 00:20:45,639
introduction but then to take that to

451
00:20:42,558 --> 00:20:49,079
the F2 Generation through siib mating

452
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:51,679
strategies either full or half

453
00:20:49,079 --> 00:20:55,240
CIB and this shows uh the crosses were

454
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:57,640
made in 2005 and 2008 we had them

455
00:20:55,240 --> 00:21:00,839
growing out in field rows they all have

456
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:03,280
kind of the same look pretty dense uh

457
00:21:00,839 --> 00:21:05,839
this is in the open sun they do pretty

458
00:21:03,279 --> 00:21:08,319
well you can see flower buds on them by

459
00:21:05,839 --> 00:21:10,480
a year four most of them had produced

460
00:21:08,319 --> 00:21:12,960
flowers to evaluate and of course they

461
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:16,159
were spending the winter

462
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:17,840
outside so we're getting a performance

463
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:23,440
and an ornamental

464
00:21:17,839 --> 00:21:25,639
evaluation uh within four years uh by

465
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:29,240
2009 and here it shows you some of the

466
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:31,799
selections we made out of those thousand

467
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:33,720
based on ornamental value and

468
00:21:31,798 --> 00:21:35,519
performance so we're reasonably

469
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:37,640
satisfied since one of the parents was

470
00:21:35,519 --> 00:21:40,079
white and we're happy with what we were

471
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:41,759
seeing in terms of color saturation

472
00:21:40,079 --> 00:21:45,038
often times too you get this nice

473
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:46,519
patterning gardeners call them blotches

474
00:21:45,038 --> 00:21:50,079
but of course bees know them as

475
00:21:46,519 --> 00:21:53,839
pollination guides and are any of those

476
00:21:50,079 --> 00:21:57,399
that we're seeing now named CS uh

477
00:21:53,839 --> 00:21:59,399
whoops on this list uh actually no but I

478
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:00,480
will finish up with

479
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:02,919
I'll show

480
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:04,519
you okay in fact this I'm going to peel

481
00:22:02,919 --> 00:22:05,960
off from the breeding program at this

482
00:22:04,519 --> 00:22:09,879
point and pick it up at the end of the

483
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:13,759
talk and Detour a bit on on some stress

484
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:16,120
testing we've done so uh I've been

485
00:22:13,759 --> 00:22:17,879
talking so far really about you know uh

486
00:22:16,119 --> 00:22:19,678
transferring resistance

487
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:25,320
genes

488
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:27,679
um to to progyny and in pathology the

489
00:22:25,319 --> 00:22:29,240
operating principle is is called the

490
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:30,679
disease triangle

491
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:33,679
I know many of you have probably been

492
00:22:30,679 --> 00:22:35,080
introduced to this uh so the disease

493
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:38,798
symptoms we

494
00:22:35,079 --> 00:22:40,480
see uh under in outdoor conditions is

495
00:22:38,798 --> 00:22:42,960
really the interaction between the host

496
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:45,200
plant the pathogen and the environment

497
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:46,600
and the environment can have a huge

498
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:50,519
effect on

499
00:22:46,599 --> 00:22:53,278
moderating um the outcomes and typically

500
00:22:50,519 --> 00:22:55,918
uh stress environmental conditions

501
00:22:53,278 --> 00:22:58,200
reduce resistance that's a phenomena

502
00:22:55,919 --> 00:23:00,720
that's called predisposition so if you

503
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:05,798
look at abiotic stresses like extremes

504
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:08,720
of moisture or temperature salinity

505
00:23:05,798 --> 00:23:11,158
ozone those are all things that can

506
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,919
somehow change host physiology in a way

507
00:23:11,159 --> 00:23:15,799
that

508
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:17,840
weakens uh its defense response and in

509
00:23:15,798 --> 00:23:20,918
particular I was interested in looking

510
00:23:17,839 --> 00:23:23,319
at flooding and heat because those are

511
00:23:20,919 --> 00:23:26,600
two traits that deal immediately with

512
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:29,678
our desire to move these plants South

513
00:23:26,599 --> 00:23:31,959
and also with uh really the heavy kind

514
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:34,960
of substandard soil conditions you find

515
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:37,919
in most most

516
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:40,519
Landscapes so in 2011 we conducted a

517
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:44,880
field flooding trial we put out an array

518
00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:46,879
of genotypes um some unknowns as well as

519
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:48,120
some controls both susceptible and

520
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:51,559
resistant

521
00:23:48,119 --> 00:23:53,599
checks and um this was an area where we

522
00:23:51,558 --> 00:23:56,639
knew that we suspected the pathogen was

523
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:59,639
present in our Fields the idea initially

524
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:02,120
was to flood the area by pumping in

525
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:04,559
water from our pond but it it turned out

526
00:24:02,119 --> 00:24:07,079
to be the wetest year on record in

527
00:24:04,558 --> 00:24:10,200
Northeast Ohio so mother nature took

528
00:24:07,079 --> 00:24:12,278
over our treatment plan and we had

529
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:14,038
conditions like shown there on the left

530
00:24:12,278 --> 00:24:16,359
repeatedly throughout the season

531
00:24:14,038 --> 00:24:18,400
probably on seven or eight occasions

532
00:24:16,359 --> 00:24:21,399
where we would we would flood and then

533
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:23,960
over the course of a day or two it would

534
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:25,640
drain so by the end of one season then

535
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:28,600
there were clear you know most things

536
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:32,440
were looking pretty bad from outright

537
00:24:28,599 --> 00:24:36,519
dead to often times a chosis is a sign

538
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:38,080
of of stress of of root Rod damage but

539
00:24:36,519 --> 00:24:39,440
what really stood out was how well

540
00:24:38,079 --> 00:24:42,079
hypertherm

541
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:43,679
performed uh under those conditions

542
00:24:42,079 --> 00:24:45,839
that's shown

543
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:49,399
here so

544
00:24:45,839 --> 00:24:51,599
it and when we did it so we we harvested

545
00:24:49,398 --> 00:24:54,359
all the dead plants got root scores of

546
00:24:51,599 --> 00:24:57,798
five and then we harvested the survivors

547
00:24:54,359 --> 00:24:58,839
and and um calculated the values for

548
00:24:57,798 --> 00:25:00,679
those

549
00:24:58,839 --> 00:25:03,158
and this shows the breakdown we had

550
00:25:00,679 --> 00:25:05,798
groups of susceptible plants resistant

551
00:25:03,159 --> 00:25:08,840
benchmarks three of those are resistant

552
00:25:05,798 --> 00:25:12,200
plants that don't have hyperm in them

553
00:25:08,839 --> 00:25:13,879
some experimental hybrids with unknown

554
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:17,278
um resistance levels and then the

555
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:21,720
species itself at the bottom and on the

556
00:25:17,278 --> 00:25:23,558
left here this column shows uh disease

557
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:25,919
scores under non-f flooded conditions

558
00:25:23,558 --> 00:25:28,359
and these were determined in previous

559
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:32,480
experiments uh before the the field Tru

560
00:25:28,359 --> 00:25:35,639
trial so um you know our resistant group

561
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:38,079
uh here and here had Roots values of

562
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:40,480
about two which is equivalent to uh just

563
00:25:38,079 --> 00:25:45,359
damage to fine Roots but but nothing

564
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:47,759
further under flooded conditions um some

565
00:25:45,359 --> 00:25:51,119
clear changes occurred everything was

566
00:25:47,759 --> 00:25:54,599
more susceptible under stress but in

567
00:25:51,119 --> 00:25:57,879
particular the the resistant benchmarks

568
00:25:54,599 --> 00:26:00,038
almost doubled from uh their root scores

569
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:02,200
so that's equivalent to from going from

570
00:26:00,038 --> 00:26:04,759
just having fine root damage to damage

571
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:07,558
up in the crown region so these plants

572
00:26:04,759 --> 00:26:11,119
were nearly dead and contrast

573
00:26:07,558 --> 00:26:13,639
hyperm uh although the values went up in

574
00:26:11,119 --> 00:26:18,639
root scores only about

575
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:20,759
30% and the hybrids of hypertherm uh did

576
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:23,240
quite well overall they weren't

577
00:26:20,759 --> 00:26:25,278
significantly different from the the

578
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:28,278
parent species in terms of root score

579
00:26:25,278 --> 00:26:28,278
values

580
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:35,679
and you know we're attributing these

581
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:39,919
results not to flooding stress uh

582
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:43,080
directly but to um pathogens and I mean

583
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:47,120
hypoxia is a possibility uh typically

584
00:26:43,079 --> 00:26:50,839
doesn't lead in to U plant

585
00:26:47,119 --> 00:26:54,000
mortality uh and Road D are can handle

586
00:26:50,839 --> 00:26:57,558
about 48 Hours of flooding with with no

587
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:59,079
issue um plus the plants really the

588
00:26:57,558 --> 00:27:01,038
sequence are mortality in the field

589
00:26:59,079 --> 00:27:03,558
really followed our expectations based

590
00:27:01,038 --> 00:27:06,240
on our Benchmark so that the susceptible

591
00:27:03,558 --> 00:27:07,918
plants died right away resistant plants

592
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:10,960
held on

593
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:15,320
longer and then to kind of close out

594
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:19,319
that that question we also um isolated

595
00:27:15,319 --> 00:27:21,359
phytop from necrotic regions uh of the

596
00:27:19,319 --> 00:27:24,319
field plants and so that's done by in

597
00:27:21,359 --> 00:27:26,319
this case we took pieces of stem near

598
00:27:24,319 --> 00:27:29,200
the crown region grew them out on

599
00:27:26,319 --> 00:27:32,759
semi-elective media which will screen

600
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:37,240
for phyas but not at at the genus level

601
00:27:32,759 --> 00:27:39,278
but not at the species level um phop

602
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:43,399
chinon though does have kind of an

603
00:27:39,278 --> 00:27:45,720
unusual morphology uh it's Coral like or

604
00:27:43,398 --> 00:27:48,639
coralloid so that's another indication

605
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:51,600
of a potential match and then finally uh

606
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:53,159
we had those samples sent to Ohio State

607
00:27:51,599 --> 00:27:55,240
and they did a sequence

608
00:27:53,159 --> 00:27:58,360
analysis against the there's a

609
00:27:55,240 --> 00:28:01,880
diagnostic storage protein in in phyto

610
00:27:58,359 --> 00:28:06,678
cinamon and the match was 96 to 100% so

611
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:07,919
we're fairly certain that um that uh

612
00:28:06,679 --> 00:28:12,278
really

613
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:14,399
flood um the phyto was was causing the

614
00:28:12,278 --> 00:28:16,398
symptoms and that it was uh that some of

615
00:28:14,398 --> 00:28:19,079
the effects we were seeing were were

616
00:28:16,398 --> 00:28:21,639
aided and eded by by the flooding

617
00:28:19,079 --> 00:28:24,319
treatment uh so in conclusions from the

618
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:26,399
flooding trials that it's it's less um

619
00:28:24,319 --> 00:28:29,278
predisposed to disease than other

620
00:28:26,398 --> 00:28:30,239
resistant renrin the trait's heritable

621
00:28:29,278 --> 00:28:33,960
because the

622
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:37,480
f1s um did almost add statistically they

623
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:39,440
did as well as the resistant parent and

624
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:42,159
this is good in the sense that uh in

625
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:43,798
terms of a a a product development

626
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:47,320
because we could potentially develop

627
00:28:43,798 --> 00:28:50,480
Renren that can withstand uh sub those

628
00:28:47,319 --> 00:28:52,079
poor soils heavy soils found around uh

629
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:56,000
in home

630
00:28:52,079 --> 00:28:59,119
Landscapes we also looked at heat

631
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:02,200
stress and uh this this is another key

632
00:28:59,119 --> 00:29:04,319
question the um being that are these

633
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:05,319
plants that are adapted to warm climates

634
00:29:04,319 --> 00:29:08,599
like

635
00:29:05,319 --> 00:29:11,200
hyperin uh less predisposed to disease

636
00:29:08,599 --> 00:29:15,398
under high temperature stress and to do

637
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:18,759
these kinds of experiments we we um we

638
00:29:15,398 --> 00:29:21,199
chose we we chose a a pulse treatment

639
00:29:18,759 --> 00:29:23,079
method where you could expose tissue in

640
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:27,080
this case roots to

641
00:29:23,079 --> 00:29:28,639
heat remove that stress then inoculate

642
00:29:27,079 --> 00:29:31,519
it or and include

643
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:33,320
uninoculated controls and then

644
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:35,720
subsequently measure the level of

645
00:29:33,319 --> 00:29:39,079
resistance in those treated

646
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:43,360
plants and we use large water baths such

647
00:29:39,079 --> 00:29:45,319
as this one here to um apply heat we

648
00:29:43,359 --> 00:29:48,398
grow either single plants or seedlings

649
00:29:45,319 --> 00:29:51,158
and pots and then drop those pots into a

650
00:29:48,398 --> 00:29:53,199
poly bag and immerse it in the water

651
00:29:51,159 --> 00:29:55,480
bath for treatment and our treatment

652
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:58,798
temperatures range from s of room

653
00:29:55,480 --> 00:30:02,000
temperature up to about 42 Celsius

654
00:29:58,798 --> 00:30:04,599
typically the experiment was done one

655
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:07,640
hour to Target in the bath and then one

656
00:30:04,599 --> 00:30:07,639
hour at the Target

657
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:15,640
temperature and these are some data we

658
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:16,919
just got uh this winter um comparing

659
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:19,960
Asian

660
00:30:16,919 --> 00:30:24,038
species U for the response to heat

661
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:25,960
stress uh and I just have summary means

662
00:30:24,038 --> 00:30:30,240
for these I don't I haven't run the

663
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:32,880
stats yet um but basically we have a red

664
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:35,200
so these are root Rod scores plotted

665
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:37,600
against days after inoculation and we're

666
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:41,519
comparing on the bars the

667
00:30:37,599 --> 00:30:44,359
controls wither without heat but no

668
00:30:41,519 --> 00:30:47,079
phyo and then wither without heat plus

669
00:30:44,359 --> 00:30:49,959
phop being the green bars and the dark

670
00:30:47,079 --> 00:30:51,519
green is the heat treatment so one thing

671
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:53,679
to point out in the controls is that

672
00:30:51,519 --> 00:30:56,079
there's no lethal effect of this heat

673
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:59,639
stress on the

674
00:30:56,079 --> 00:31:02,319
plants um and in this case this is a

675
00:30:59,638 --> 00:31:04,079
species from Central Asia called ponum

676
00:31:02,319 --> 00:31:08,240
it's a susceptible plant it was really

677
00:31:04,079 --> 00:31:10,879
our control and it it uh we reached

678
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:15,798
almost complete mortality within a week

679
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:19,000
and a half of inoculation in both um the

680
00:31:15,798 --> 00:31:20,558
nonstress and the heat treatment no

681
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:23,480
surprises there I mean it's hard to make

682
00:31:20,558 --> 00:31:26,359
a very susceptible plant more

683
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:28,200
susceptible uh in contrast though we we

684
00:31:26,359 --> 00:31:31,918
looked at two Asian species that are

685
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:33,319
resistant one from Japan called kisi

686
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:35,720
which is not considered to be heat

687
00:31:33,319 --> 00:31:36,798
tolerant and then our heat tolerant

688
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:40,079
hyper

689
00:31:36,798 --> 00:31:43,679
eum and in those cases the heat stress

690
00:31:40,079 --> 00:31:46,480
in kisi the dark green clearly elevated

691
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:49,519
the disease scores uh especially in the

692
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:51,720
early part of the time course again I

693
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:53,839
don't have a test yet on significance

694
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:57,480
but it it looks like it could

695
00:31:53,839 --> 00:31:59,638
be uh and hypertherm uh except for the

696
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:02,639
very first sampling date which could be

697
00:31:59,638 --> 00:32:06,158
sampling error uh all subsequent dates

698
00:32:02,638 --> 00:32:10,000
the heat stress plants showed uh the

699
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:13,360
same as or or lower uh root scores than

700
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:15,200
the non-stress one so seem to Su suggest

701
00:32:13,359 --> 00:32:17,959
that hyperm is not

702
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:19,880
predisposed to Disease by higher soil

703
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:23,000
temperatures much in the way that it was

704
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:25,799
less predisposed um by flooding so those

705
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:29,240
are good two attributes in addition to

706
00:32:25,798 --> 00:32:31,798
resistance per se

707
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:36,319
um another study

708
00:32:31,798 --> 00:32:39,519
was uh more um ecological so we wanted

709
00:32:36,319 --> 00:32:43,720
to know whether in natural populations

710
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:46,880
are warm adapted ecotypes more disease

711
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:51,399
tolerant uh following heat stress than

712
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:54,080
their uh cold tolerant relatives and and

713
00:32:51,398 --> 00:32:57,079
do this we switch to a a species called

714
00:32:54,079 --> 00:32:58,960
renin minus which is native to the

715
00:32:57,079 --> 00:33:01,638
Eastern

716
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:05,200
us and it grows from high elevation

717
00:33:01,638 --> 00:33:07,918
North Carolina down to within 50 miles

718
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:11,120
of the Gulf Coast so in the Florida

719
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:14,320
Panhandle and um Southern Alabama for

720
00:33:11,119 --> 00:33:16,759
instance and we've been collecting those

721
00:33:14,319 --> 00:33:18,960
over the years putting together a trying

722
00:33:16,759 --> 00:33:21,839
to capture the really a rangewide

723
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:23,120
collection of this species and we have

724
00:33:21,839 --> 00:33:28,439
compared

725
00:33:23,119 --> 00:33:32,038
two um two populations so far uh the one

726
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:33,600
here at elevation 4,000 ft in North

727
00:33:32,038 --> 00:33:37,038
Carolina

728
00:33:33,599 --> 00:33:40,278
and one at low elevation in southern

729
00:33:37,038 --> 00:33:42,519
Georgia um called Providence Canyon so

730
00:33:40,278 --> 00:33:45,398
this is the shrub here at the top of

731
00:33:42,519 --> 00:33:47,319
hawkville mountain and you'd find the

732
00:33:45,398 --> 00:33:49,479
the road enter minus at the bottom of

733
00:33:47,319 --> 00:33:53,278
this Canyon along the

734
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:56,079
riverbed in Providence

735
00:33:53,278 --> 00:33:58,798
Canyon so we did the same kinds of um

736
00:33:56,079 --> 00:34:02,558
disease progress plots same kind of heat

737
00:33:58,798 --> 00:34:04,278
treatments that I described earlier um

738
00:34:02,558 --> 00:34:07,838
temperatures were a little bit different

739
00:34:04,278 --> 00:34:11,878
I'm showing you results at 26 and at 42

740
00:34:07,838 --> 00:34:15,480
celus we also did them at 34 and 50°

741
00:34:11,878 --> 00:34:16,960
C um looking at mortality rates over

742
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:20,079
time so at

743
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:22,440
26° um and the blue is the northern high

744
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:25,919
elevation population and the red is the

745
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:29,280
southern low and these are the controls

746
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:32,199
down here so heat treated but not

747
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:35,159
inoculated again there's no that heat

748
00:34:32,199 --> 00:34:40,678
treatment appears to be

749
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:42,838
sublethal and um at 26 they they're

750
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:47,519
basically the same statistically the

751
00:34:42,838 --> 00:34:50,559
same uh response both species are highly

752
00:34:47,519 --> 00:34:53,719
susceptible uh to phyo so there's I know

753
00:34:50,559 --> 00:34:56,320
mortality within almost complete within

754
00:34:53,719 --> 00:34:58,919
under two weeks from inoculation and

755
00:34:56,320 --> 00:35:01,440
that you'd expect that uh in the case of

756
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:04,079
a natural population that's being

757
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:06,119
challenged with an invasive pathogen

758
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:10,359
it's never seen it

759
00:35:06,119 --> 00:35:13,320
before uh at 42 Celsius I there's a high

760
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:16,519
degree of mortality and ultimately in

761
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:18,920
both populations but the the rate of

762
00:35:16,519 --> 00:35:22,280
disease development or mortality in the

763
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:24,079
southern population is much slower and

764
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:26,280
looking at areas under the

765
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:28,560
curve here that turns out to be a

766
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:31,599
statistically significant difference

767
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:34,838
so there is a transient effect anyway

768
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:36,800
the heat stress appears to be initiating

769
00:35:34,838 --> 00:35:39,400
some sort of Defense

770
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:41,079
response in the warm climate ecotypes

771
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:42,838
that's not found in the cold ones so

772
00:35:41,079 --> 00:35:45,000
that I thought was a fairly novel result

773
00:35:42,838 --> 00:35:47,920
and we want to uh see if we can

774
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:50,960
generalize that those data looking at a

775
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:50,960
larger sample of

776
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:57,800
populations still the question of root

777
00:35:55,159 --> 00:36:00,559
damage is there you know it's sublethal

778
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:03,359
but you don't know if there is some

779
00:36:00,559 --> 00:36:07,078
something going on at 42 Cel that's

780
00:36:03,358 --> 00:36:09,799
pretty warm uh so we um and that could

781
00:36:07,079 --> 00:36:13,280
confound the interpretation of results

782
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:16,599
so we did um some viability assays on

783
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:19,880
both populations using TTC staining a

784
00:36:16,599 --> 00:36:22,680
vital stain that will turn cells Pink as

785
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:24,680
it as it's reduced by mitochondria and

786
00:36:22,679 --> 00:36:26,519
you can elute that stain and you know

787
00:36:24,679 --> 00:36:30,199
measure it spectrometer with a

788
00:36:26,519 --> 00:36:33,679
spectrometer so here we're showing

789
00:36:30,199 --> 00:36:37,239
absorbance uh standardized over dry

790
00:36:33,679 --> 00:36:40,039
weight uh milligrams dry weight for both

791
00:36:37,239 --> 00:36:42,598
Southern low Northern High populations

792
00:36:40,039 --> 00:36:46,440
and there is no significant difference

793
00:36:42,599 --> 00:36:49,559
in viability estimated that way so we

794
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:53,079
feel that at within that 26 to 42

795
00:36:49,559 --> 00:36:55,119
Celsius window um root viability is not

796
00:36:53,079 --> 00:36:58,240
an issue and that's a good range of

797
00:36:55,119 --> 00:37:02,119
temperatures to continue working in

798
00:36:58,239 --> 00:37:04,679
at 50 Celsius I mentioned we we had done

799
00:37:02,119 --> 00:37:07,720
um we had done a screen there and there

800
00:37:04,679 --> 00:37:12,118
actually was probably 50% loss of

801
00:37:07,719 --> 00:37:12,118
viability in those tissues a bit too

802
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:17,358
extreme well we don't really understand

803
00:37:15,239 --> 00:37:19,078
in Rod Dennis what's going on at the

804
00:37:17,358 --> 00:37:21,719
physiological level but there are

805
00:37:19,079 --> 00:37:24,280
reports there's increasingly reports

806
00:37:21,719 --> 00:37:29,318
from other systems notably rabid opsis

807
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:32,280
and tomato of of how uh pred disos might

808
00:37:29,318 --> 00:37:35,400
function and it really involves sort of

809
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:38,480
antagonistic me metabolisms so you start

810
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:42,480
with a resistant uh plant given it an

811
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:44,960
abiotic stress that kicks in the hormone

812
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:48,440
abscissic acid which is commonly it's a

813
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:52,679
very common uh upregulated stress

814
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:55,480
related hormone but ABA increased ABA

815
00:37:52,679 --> 00:37:58,078
can cause a inhibition of Defense

816
00:37:55,480 --> 00:38:01,519
signaling Pathways that are

817
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:05,039
specifically those mediated by jasmonic

818
00:38:01,519 --> 00:38:08,440
acid or salicylic acid so if there is

819
00:38:05,039 --> 00:38:10,960
then a pathogen challenge during or at

820
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:13,358
subsequent to that stress then the

821
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:15,159
defense system of the plant is lowered

822
00:38:13,358 --> 00:38:17,799
and you can change phenotypes from

823
00:38:15,159 --> 00:38:20,159
resistance to

824
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:22,240
susceptible that's um that's kind of a

825
00:38:20,159 --> 00:38:25,399
consensus model there's certainly lots

826
00:38:22,239 --> 00:38:27,679
of uh variations on that and we know and

827
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:31,240
what I feel from my work since we've

828
00:38:27,679 --> 00:38:33,039
identified genotypes that are less

829
00:38:31,239 --> 00:38:36,799
predisposed that clearly there's

830
00:38:33,039 --> 00:38:39,559
probably involves some different uh uh

831
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:42,560
regulation at the gene level and with

832
00:38:39,559 --> 00:38:43,880
the Advent of less expensive genomic

833
00:38:42,559 --> 00:38:46,519
analyses

834
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:48,680
metabolomics comparative transcriptome

835
00:38:46,519 --> 00:38:51,719
analysis uh these would be perhaps

836
00:38:48,679 --> 00:38:55,078
fruitful studies uh for the future if

837
00:38:51,719 --> 00:38:58,559
you were predisposed to

838
00:38:55,079 --> 00:39:02,079
that all right well finally back to the

839
00:38:58,559 --> 00:39:04,799
breeding program um since we wanted to

840
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:07,359
develop heat tolerant Lo of Denis the

841
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:10,280
obvious thing was to put them in the

842
00:39:07,358 --> 00:39:13,799
South and see how they did uh for this

843
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:16,680
work uh we found a industry partner with

844
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:20,000
plant development services based in U

845
00:39:16,679 --> 00:39:22,000
near Mobile Alabama uh they have a brand

846
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:25,199
called Southern Living plant collection

847
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:27,719
which is um quite popular and pdsi

848
00:39:25,199 --> 00:39:30,318
really they're not a nursery person say

849
00:39:27,719 --> 00:39:32,480
they they work between breeders like me

850
00:39:30,318 --> 00:39:35,039
and the marketplace they they take care

851
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:37,440
of the the development aspects of the

852
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:39,759
plant um those are services that we

853
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:42,480
don't have in House at

854
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:45,760
Holden and uh the test site was in

855
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:48,760
Southern Louisiana Independence we put

856
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:51,920
had put in over 165 selections that we

857
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:54,599
made in Madison initially and and a put

858
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:57,680
out a replicated field trial the plants

859
00:39:54,599 --> 00:40:00,519
were shaded I think for the first half

860
00:39:57,679 --> 00:40:03,199
of the first summer and subsequently

861
00:40:00,519 --> 00:40:06,519
have been out uh in the

862
00:40:03,199 --> 00:40:09,279
open um in in this is now the beginning

863
00:40:06,519 --> 00:40:14,280
of year three of the trial so they get

864
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:14,280
fairly strong afternoon sun

865
00:40:18,119 --> 00:40:25,760
uh and based on the results so far there

866
00:40:22,838 --> 00:40:28,199
are really about 20% or maybe 30 out of

867
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:31,599
the 165 select collections that we put

868
00:40:28,199 --> 00:40:35,318
in have really performed well that is

869
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:37,000
we're um you know we're at 100% Survivor

870
00:40:35,318 --> 00:40:39,838
ship and then the surviving plants

871
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:41,639
themselves are um vigorous Growers they

872
00:40:39,838 --> 00:40:43,799
have good Leaf quality and they're

873
00:40:41,639 --> 00:40:45,879
producing good flowers such as the one

874
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:48,960
shown

875
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:51,760
here and this past March I was down

876
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:54,199
there uh while they were in bloom the

877
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:58,440
first time I had been there in In Bloom

878
00:40:54,199 --> 00:41:01,358
and we selected three for introdu ction

879
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:03,519
uh those are the ones shown here so uh

880
00:41:01,358 --> 00:41:06,480
two pinks one kind of a clear pink the

881
00:41:03,519 --> 00:41:09,440
other more of a rose pink some of these

882
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:13,480
patterns these flares and blotches this

883
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:16,599
one has a a frilled margin to the pedal

884
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:18,800
um as does this there's another nice

885
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:20,960
feature where the petals the backs of

886
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:22,760
the petals will be Darkly pigmented and

887
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:25,800
the face will be lighter so that creates

888
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:28,040
kind of a a by color effect and these

889
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:30,680
little nuances do make a difference it

890
00:41:28,039 --> 00:41:33,119
makes the plant fancier and we're you

891
00:41:30,679 --> 00:41:34,838
know we hope that these can compete with

892
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:37,318
what's already kind of been established

893
00:41:34,838 --> 00:41:39,440
as the current standard for

894
00:41:37,318 --> 00:41:41,079
renrin uh and of course in the South

895
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:42,280
they will have no competition because

896
00:41:41,079 --> 00:41:46,720
there are no

897
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:48,760
rendin yet that um have been developed

898
00:41:46,719 --> 00:41:52,519
there so these will go into tissue

899
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:57,720
culture one this one already is uh and

900
00:41:52,519 --> 00:41:57,719
then subsequently out to uh Growers

901
00:41:58,559 --> 00:42:03,960
we can glean some extra information from

902
00:42:00,679 --> 00:42:06,318
that field trial by um we want to do the

903
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:09,119
confirm the presence of phyo just as we

904
00:42:06,318 --> 00:42:12,159
did in in Madison Ohio by isolating and

905
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:14,079
sequencing the pathogen uh just to prove

906
00:42:12,159 --> 00:42:17,078
that that's what's causing it it is an

907
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:19,640
old Nursery site uh and they apparently

908
00:42:17,079 --> 00:42:22,160
grew a lot of aelas and Chamas there and

909
00:42:19,639 --> 00:42:25,159
those are both host for phytop and

910
00:42:22,159 --> 00:42:28,279
because nurseries are constantly moving

911
00:42:25,159 --> 00:42:31,239
plants in and out of their in ventory

912
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:33,720
and phyo travels in soil it's quite

913
00:42:31,239 --> 00:42:36,358
likely that it's there all the certainly

914
00:42:33,719 --> 00:42:38,078
the symptoms are consistent with it and

915
00:42:36,358 --> 00:42:40,358
then it would be good to go back and

916
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:42,160
look at both the top and bottom classes

917
00:42:40,358 --> 00:42:46,598
of performers you know we have the

918
00:42:42,159 --> 00:42:50,759
original mother plants still in Ohio and

919
00:42:46,599 --> 00:42:53,599
um so we can go back to them and do uh

920
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:56,599
test for resistance under control

921
00:42:53,599 --> 00:42:59,440
conditions and confirm that they are

922
00:42:56,599 --> 00:43:01,119
respective resistant or susceptible and

923
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:04,280
that will really close the circle on

924
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:07,960
this notion that uh disease

925
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:10,800
resistance is is a key trait to um

926
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:12,519
surviving in a warm climate like that

927
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:14,839
with high disease

928
00:43:12,519 --> 00:43:17,599
pressure well Holden we always talk

929
00:43:14,838 --> 00:43:20,838
about being about more than just a

930
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:25,720
pretty plant uh because we're a serious

931
00:43:20,838 --> 00:43:27,719
institution on a serious mission but the

932
00:43:25,719 --> 00:43:29,480
and so I even though the scope of my

933
00:43:27,719 --> 00:43:31,519
project is fairly narrow I've tried to

934
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:35,199
move it in a Direction that's topical

935
00:43:31,519 --> 00:43:38,000
that addresses the issues that um you

936
00:43:35,199 --> 00:43:41,199
know knowledgeable scientists are are

937
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:43,199
concerned about in these days and age

938
00:43:41,199 --> 00:43:47,078
and so the issue of sustainability is

939
00:43:43,199 --> 00:43:49,719
addressed because resistance will allow

940
00:43:47,079 --> 00:43:51,839
probably result in reduced pesticide use

941
00:43:49,719 --> 00:43:54,959
typically fungicide drenches that are

942
00:43:51,838 --> 00:43:58,558
used in nurseries plants are broadly

943
00:43:54,960 --> 00:44:01,039
adaptable uh I think my goal of covering

944
00:43:58,559 --> 00:44:04,119
zones 5 to n has probably been modified

945
00:44:01,039 --> 00:44:06,719
by the past two Winters and I think we

946
00:44:04,119 --> 00:44:10,440
will release these marketed to zone six

947
00:44:06,719 --> 00:44:12,519
to n although you can you know many zone

948
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:17,480
five winners it will do fine just as it

949
00:44:12,519 --> 00:44:19,759
has done well in Ohio um up until

950
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:21,719
recently we'll call them climate change

951
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:26,119
ready certainly they're they're

952
00:44:21,719 --> 00:44:28,480
positioned for um global warming and

953
00:44:26,119 --> 00:44:31,760
warming is not just an issue in terms of

954
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:34,920
stress on Plants but most

955
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:38,960
predictions uh state that disease

956
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:41,599
pressure will also increase under those

957
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:44,838
conditions um and there's an increased

958
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:47,160
chance with warmer climats that

959
00:44:44,838 --> 00:44:51,239
pathogens like phyto could

960
00:44:47,159 --> 00:44:53,000
naturalize in in our Northern forests

961
00:44:51,239 --> 00:44:55,679
and finally it's a good example of a you

962
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:59,039
know solution based use of

963
00:44:55,679 --> 00:45:02,719
biodiversity um showing how uh we can

964
00:44:59,039 --> 00:45:06,759
tap a species like hyperm to address a

965
00:45:02,719 --> 00:45:09,480
real stubborn problematic issue like

966
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:10,960
root rot disease finally I'd just like

967
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:15,639
to

968
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:18,280
thank my some of my staff uh Jing Wong

969
00:45:15,639 --> 00:45:21,440
is a research associate who works year

970
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:24,040
round with me and Hillary Wright is been

971
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:27,559
a seasonal it's one of our volunteers

972
00:45:24,039 --> 00:45:32,159
Susan Hannah and Mike

973
00:45:27,559 --> 00:45:34,240
collaboration with pdsi uh is through um

974
00:45:32,159 --> 00:45:36,199
Buddy Lee shown here on the right who's

975
00:45:34,239 --> 00:45:39,000
the director of plant Innovations for

976
00:45:36,199 --> 00:45:41,719
pdsi and also an accomplished ornamental

977
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:43,760
breeder in his own right and finally a

978
00:45:41,719 --> 00:45:46,799
few sources of

979
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:50,359
funding U not to mention our my major

980
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:50,359
underwriter which is the hold

981
00:45:52,239 --> 00:45:58,919
arum that's okay we can have the lights

982
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:58,920
on

983
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:06,720
you had mentioned you had like maybe 10

984
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:09,039
genotypes of H used to prevent in

985
00:46:06,719 --> 00:46:11,039
compression were those selected for

986
00:46:09,039 --> 00:46:13,400
Superior performance in terms of

987
00:46:11,039 --> 00:46:16,159
resistance from a

988
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:18,599
broader they were I

989
00:46:16,159 --> 00:46:22,000
um although there is some structure

990
00:46:18,599 --> 00:46:23,680
those they were I didn't have any H

991
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:27,559
plant when I started wasn't in our

992
00:46:23,679 --> 00:46:29,239
collection uh but there's a u outfit in

993
00:46:27,559 --> 00:46:32,720
on the west coast called the third end

994
00:46:29,239 --> 00:46:35,118
of species Foundation ATA Washington and

995
00:46:32,719 --> 00:46:37,558
they have a pretty good World collection

996
00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:40,960
including several hyp region so they

997
00:46:37,559 --> 00:46:43,599
made some crosses of those accession

998
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:46,920
their accession and sent me SE and then

999
00:46:43,599 --> 00:46:49,559
I screen that for resistance and took

1000
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:51,960
out really the survivors that were

1001
00:46:49,559 --> 00:46:55,040
really the

1002
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:57,159
most um you didn't know about their

1003
00:46:55,039 --> 00:47:00,719
flower attributes

1004
00:46:57,159 --> 00:47:02,440
um the time we selected those pars most

1005
00:47:00,719 --> 00:47:06,000
these but there are some different some

1006
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:09,000
you have larger flowers but maybe more

1007
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:09,000
substance

1008
00:47:10,559 --> 00:47:16,559
others do any of the uh new varieties

1009
00:47:14,159 --> 00:47:20,000
have ornamentally interesting

1010
00:47:16,559 --> 00:47:22,720
grp no they're not really known for

1011
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:24,719
showing food it's uh they're green

1012
00:47:22,719 --> 00:47:28,118
turning

1013
00:47:24,719 --> 00:47:31,118
brown yes I ask if you have any idea

1014
00:47:28,119 --> 00:47:31,119
what the resistance

1015
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:39,599
is no um I don't really I it's it's a

1016
00:47:38,039 --> 00:47:42,039
it's

1017
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:45,920
polygenic it's not an

1018
00:47:42,039 --> 00:47:49,199
AR so it's it's probably it's probably

1019
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:49,200
multi could

1020
00:47:50,639 --> 00:47:53,639
invol

1021
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:59,040
PHS we think that there's an age

1022
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:01,280
responsibity I didn't show that on the

1023
00:47:59,039 --> 00:48:03,000
didn't discuss it on the her plot but

1024
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:06,280
the The

1025
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:08,960
Offspring um scores were the

1026
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:12,319
whole they had shifted up and Val so

1027
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:15,400
they were more susceptible in parents as

1028
00:48:12,318 --> 00:48:20,599
a group because we were measuring six

1029
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:20,599
mon versus phys mature

1030
00:48:24,318 --> 00:48:28,318
parents yeah

1031
00:48:29,318 --> 00:48:34,318
so when you your D you R how are we

1032
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:37,679
going to

1033
00:48:34,318 --> 00:48:40,920
know each had the

1034
00:48:37,679 --> 00:48:44,279
cities Geographic names right so what

1035
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:47,280
are you going to do so car

1036
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:50,079
we well I I guess a lot of it it may be

1037
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:53,000
somewh out of my hands I think pdsi will

1038
00:48:50,079 --> 00:48:55,160
probably have their own ideas and

1039
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:57,400
they're really you know they're the

1040
00:48:55,159 --> 00:49:01,239
marketeers they do a lot that and maybe

1041
00:48:57,400 --> 00:49:04,079
they have a sense of what

1042
00:49:01,239 --> 00:49:06,959
what so we haven't quite got to that

1043
00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:08,960
point of discussion but uh we sort of

1044
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:11,400
have another we sort of do what I call

1045
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:15,480
Leach classic hyds that we're

1046
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:15,480
introducing uh we taking the name

1047
00:49:16,239 --> 00:49:19,679
gold solar

1048
00:49:19,838 --> 00:49:24,719
FL so you will know

1049
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:28,519
those those wouldn't be for the South

1050
00:49:24,719 --> 00:49:28,519
they would be for the traditional

1051
00:49:28,838 --> 00:49:32,239
well I think we're out of time but again

1052
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:34,838
I want to thank you Steve for traveling

1053
00:49:32,239 --> 00:49:38,838
to itha and sharing uh your research

1054
00:49:34,838 --> 00:49:38,838
with us you're welcome thank you

1055
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:45,920
for this has been a production of
