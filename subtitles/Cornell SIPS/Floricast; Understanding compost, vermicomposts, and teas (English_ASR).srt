00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:11,759
welcome to this floorcast episode on

4
00:00:09,199 --> 00:00:14,320
understanding compost vermicomposts and

5
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:16,079
teas the purpose of this floracast is to

6
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:18,240
introduce the listener to several key

7
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:21,439
concepts related to using compost

8
00:00:18,239 --> 00:00:23,599
vermicompost teas and extracts as well

9
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:25,839
as to describe their use in certified

10
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,039
organic production systems in the

11
00:00:25,839 --> 00:00:29,518
greenhouse

12
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:32,160
composts are simply organic matter that

13
00:00:29,518 --> 00:00:33,839
has been subjected to decomposition in a

14
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:36,479
controlled process

15
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,480
compost can be useful in substrate

16
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:41,359
production because they can be a source

17
00:00:38,479 --> 00:00:43,199
of microbes for example for suppressing

18
00:00:41,359 --> 00:00:45,920
root borne diseases

19
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:48,160
composts have a high cation exchange or

20
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:50,160
nutrient holding capacity and the

21
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:51,839
compost itself can be a slow release

22
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:53,919
nutrient source

23
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,559
in container production mature compost

24
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:58,480
should always be used immature compost

25
00:00:56,558 --> 00:01:00,718
can be high in ammonia and volatile

26
00:00:58,479 --> 00:01:01,919
organic compounds which can be damaging

27
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:03,920
to plants

28
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,118
in certified organic greenhouse

29
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,280
production

30
00:01:05,118 --> 00:01:10,319
composts are allowed according to

31
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:12,640
national organic program nop guidelines

32
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:13,679
so long as the following criteria are a

33
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,280
met

34
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,680
the compost should use approved

35
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:19,118
feedstocks which include many plant and

36
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,759
animal materials that are not

37
00:01:19,118 --> 00:01:23,680
contaminated with prohibited substances

38
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:25,840
such as herbicides

39
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:28,560
minimum temperature requirements must be

40
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:30,478
met during the composting process one

41
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,960
thing when using compost and container

42
00:01:30,478 --> 00:01:34,640
production are that all composts are not

43
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:36,559
created equal

44
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,560
therefore one cannot assume that all

45
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,719
composts can be used in container

46
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:43,600
production and it is important for a

47
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:45,920
grower to test different compost sources

48
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:48,000
as well as batches to ensure that the

49
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:50,478
material is suitable

50
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,159
i like to think of compost using the

51
00:01:50,478 --> 00:01:55,200
sausage analogy

52
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:58,000
that is all sausages are not the same uh

53
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:01,280
sausages will have different feedstocks

54
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,519
and or meat products used in making them

55
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,200
as well as different curing processes

56
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:07,359
and ultimately that's going to affect

57
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:10,000
whether you have an oscar mire weiner or

58
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:11,919
a very nice polska kielbasa

59
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,159
there are some steps that you can check

60
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:16,479
to make sure that your compost is

61
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:18,239
suitable for container production and i

62
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:20,079
do recommend that you test each batch

63
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:22,560
from a supplier to ensure its

64
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,400
suitability now let's move on to talk

65
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,800
about vermicompost

66
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,800
very simply vermicompost can be thought

67
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,560
of as worm worked waste

68
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:33,760
worms will digest and fragment the

69
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:37,039
feedstock into finely divided materials

70
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:39,359
vermicompost is not just the poop or the

71
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:41,280
castings from worms but also the other

72
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,720
organic matter that the worms have

73
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,280
divided up

74
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:47,199
verma compost can be a useful material

75
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,919
because it is because it is finely

76
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:52,238
divided it is enriched in nutrients

77
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:54,559
it contains more soluble nitrogen

78
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:55,840
phosphorus and potassium than a standard

79
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,840
compost

80
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:00,000
an example of vermicomposting that's

81
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:02,479
done on an industrial scale is available

82
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,039
at worm power llc

83
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:07,439
in the process the manure solids from a

84
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:09,120
dairy operation are collected

85
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:10,479
these solids are then brought into a

86
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,640
warehouse where they are

87
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:15,280
thermophilically composted

88
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:17,518
in static piles

89
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:19,439
this then serves as the feedstock for

90
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:22,560
the final step which is

91
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:24,878
feeding this material to millions of red

92
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:27,360
wiggler earthworms according to the

93
00:03:24,878 --> 00:03:30,239
national organic program guidelines

94
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:32,000
vermicompost is allowed in certified

95
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:34,158
organic production so long as the

96
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,560
following guidelines are met

97
00:03:34,158 --> 00:03:39,039
the verma compost material should again

98
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:41,360
be made from allowed feedstock materials

99
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:43,120
and the duration of the vermicomposting

100
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:45,120
process should be six to twelve months

101
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,280
for outdoor windrows two to four months

102
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,959
for indoor container systems

103
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,439
two to four months for angled wedge

104
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:54,080
systems and 30 to 60 days for continuous

105
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:55,919
flow reactors now let's move on to talk

106
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:58,159
about compost teas

107
00:03:55,919 --> 00:04:01,199
compost teas are liquids that are made

108
00:03:58,158 --> 00:04:03,598
by brewing or steeping compost and water

109
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:06,479
this process serves to transfer

110
00:04:03,598 --> 00:04:08,639
microbes find particulate organic matter

111
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:10,719
and soluble chemical components such as

112
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:13,518
plant available nutrients from the

113
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:15,598
compost to the liquid the benefits of

114
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:16,959
compost tea are that it contains some

115
00:04:15,598 --> 00:04:18,879
nutrients

116
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:21,120
as well compost teas can contain a

117
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:22,959
beneficial microbial community which

118
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,639
might be used for the control of foliar

119
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:26,879
and root diseases

120
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:28,960
these microbes might also be involved in

121
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:31,120
enhancing nutrient cycling

122
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:34,159
growers may question whether or not

123
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:36,240
compost teas work and the answer again

124
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:38,000
is it all depends returning to the

125
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,240
sausage analogy

126
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,399
compost teas can be

127
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:44,400
prepared in many different ways and they

128
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:46,638
can also have many different feedstocks

129
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:48,879
and additives that are used

130
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:51,360
whether or not you get a beneficial

131
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:53,439
microbial community as an end result

132
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:55,840
will depend on all of the processes that

133
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:57,759
take place up to that point one of the

134
00:04:55,839 --> 00:04:59,758
things to decide when preparing compost

135
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:01,199
teas is whether or not to actively

136
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:03,600
aerate it

137
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:06,879
a tea is what we call the material when

138
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:09,840
we do use this active process to add air

139
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:12,079
or oxygen during brewing this is done to

140
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:14,239
promote the population of aerobic

141
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:17,519
microbes

142
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:20,319
we refer to the material as an extract

143
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:22,799
when a passive process is followed that

144
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:25,279
is oxygen is not introduced during the

145
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:28,240
steeping process this might be referred

146
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:30,959
to as a non-aerated or passively aerated

147
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:33,199
extract with extracts there is no need

148
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:35,918
for specialized equipment and one

149
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:38,639
advantage of an extract is that it has a

150
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:41,839
much longer shelf life than a compost

151
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:44,079
tea in certified organic production teas

152
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:46,239
and extracts can be used if certain

153
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:48,079
criteria are met

154
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:50,240
if the material is prepared without

155
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:53,279
compost additives it can be used on

156
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:55,038
edible crops without restriction

157
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:57,439
if the material is prepared with

158
00:05:55,038 --> 00:05:58,639
additives then it can be applied without

159
00:05:57,439 --> 00:06:00,879
restriction

160
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:03,360
if the compost tea production system and

161
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:06,478
materials have been pre-tested to meet

162
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:08,479
epa guidelines for a bacterial indicator

163
00:06:06,478 --> 00:06:11,199
of fecal contamination

164
00:06:08,478 --> 00:06:13,519
if the above criteria are not met

165
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:15,120
then the particular tea or extract must

166
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:18,240
be applied

167
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:19,519
90 or 120 days prior to harvesting an

168
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:22,079
edible crop

169
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:24,000
90 days in the case that the tea or

170
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:26,399
extract material does not come into

171
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,839
direct contact with the produce

172
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:33,038
and 120 days prior if the material
