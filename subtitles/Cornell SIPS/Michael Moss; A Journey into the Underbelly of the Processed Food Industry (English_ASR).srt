thank you so much for having me I've

10
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:39,439
been really lucky to talk to um students

00:00:36,439 --> 00:00:41,920
in a bunch of places like Yale and

12

conference places like Disneyland or

00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:57,199
Physicians dealing with obesity and

17
00:00:53,960 --> 00:01:00,558
diabetes in places like uh Saudi Arabia

18
00:00:57,198 --> 00:01:04,319
here for this recent talk but I've never

19
00:01:00,558 --> 00:01:08,039
been able or allowed to actually read

20
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:09,438
from my book salt sugar fat and I'm

21
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:12,560
going to do that here today and by the

22
00:01:09,438 --> 00:01:17,000
way I laugh every time I see the cover

23
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:19,519
because it was designed by this crazy

24
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:23,159
Russian igr who lives Upstate in New

25
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:24,959
York who to do it went into his grocery

26
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:26,799
store and pulled out his favorite

27
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:29,919
products off the shelf and brought it

28
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:33,960
back to his studio and hand ripped the

29
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:37,200
lettering out of them and rearrange

30
00:01:33,959 --> 00:01:41,078
letters to reflect what is really going

31
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:43,079
on about the products that he and I and

32
00:01:41,078 --> 00:01:46,078
you probably to some extent love so

33
00:01:43,078 --> 00:01:48,839
deeply um which of course is what the is

34
00:01:46,078 --> 00:01:50,399
what the book is all about and I'm and

35
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:52,680
I'm actually not going to read from the

36
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:57,159
book but I'm going to cite a couple of

37
00:01:52,680 --> 00:02:00,560
facts from it um in

38
00:01:57,159 --> 00:02:04,600
2002 the largest food company of all

39
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:09,560
Nestle paid $2.6

40
00:02:04,599 --> 00:02:11,039
billion for the hot pocket brand that

41
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:12,959
Frozen

42
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:15,878
microwavable

43
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:20,400
delicacy that became a poster child for

44
00:02:15,878 --> 00:02:25,039
let's say exuberant snacking and five

45
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:29,280
years later Nestle acquired the rights

46
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:34,439
to this drink which helped it Corner the

47
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:37,318
market on one of the grimmest results of

48
00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:41,400
Ting every year in this country some 2

49
00:02:37,318 --> 00:02:44,958
200,000 people undergo bariatric surgery

50
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:49,599
to physically shrink their stomach as a

51
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:54,959
way of helping them to actually eat less

52
00:02:49,598 --> 00:02:58,000
um so gorge on the Hot Pocket get fat on

53
00:02:54,959 --> 00:03:01,120
the hot pocket and then eat through a

54
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:04,759
tube was Nestle's Market strategy if you

55
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:06,280
will get them fat get them thin it's on

56
00:03:04,759 --> 00:03:10,959
page

57
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:13,959
337 of the book so imagine my surprise

58
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:17,598
now summer before last when I got a call

59
00:03:13,959 --> 00:03:21,239
from none other than Nestle's research

60
00:03:17,598 --> 00:03:24,000
and development organization on the

61
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:27,480
lovely shores of Lake Geneva asking me

62
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,239
to come give my book talk to their

63
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:32,079
secret Gathering not secret private

64
00:03:29,239 --> 00:03:34,280
Gathering of 60 R&amp;D people maybe 70 or

65
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:38,719
80 from all over the world that they had

66
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:43,120
they had gathered um and um and my first

67
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:44,680
reaction was what and when I told my son

68
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:48,120
Aaron who is with us in the audience

69
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:51,000
today about it his reaction was I hope

70
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:54,719
you're not spending my future tuition

71
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,719
money on a roundtrip ticket to Geneva

72
00:03:54,719 --> 00:03:58,438
because there's no way they're going to

73
00:03:56,719 --> 00:04:00,799
let you come back home they're proba to

74
00:03:58,438 --> 00:04:04,039
shove you off the matter horn but but

75
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:07,840
know that the the R&amp;D team had a new

76
00:04:04,039 --> 00:04:10,719
head Who convinced me that he was trying

77
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:12,560
to turn a corner at Nestle they had read

78
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:15,280
the book they were responding to

79
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:17,399
changing consumer demands and in order

80
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:19,918
for them to do good they needed to hear

81
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:24,039
more from people like me about all the

82
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:29,319
bad things that they had done and

83
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:31,160
remember though this is the richest

84
00:04:29,319 --> 00:04:33,719
company in the food business or

85
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:37,759
certainly is from year to year Nestle is

86
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:41,000
the owner of 29 of what it calls the

87
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:44,199
billionaire Brands as one of its

88
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:48,279
research scientists put it to me Nestle

89
00:04:44,199 --> 00:04:51,400
is the Swiss bank that prints

90
00:04:48,279 --> 00:04:53,839
food but I decided to go in part because

91
00:04:51,399 --> 00:04:56,599
I wanted to know what their 350 phds

92
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:58,799
were up to these days who work on

93
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:01,879
exclusively on food so I went I actually

94
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:05,038
took Aaron with me as a as a bodyguard

95
00:05:01,879 --> 00:05:07,360
this is the group right before I got up

96
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:09,478
to give my little Spiel and and I'm

97
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:12,240
giving you a little bit of the shortened

98
00:05:09,478 --> 00:05:14,800
version of what I said to what I said to

99
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,960
Nestle um and I started out with the

100
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:19,038
fact that in

101
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:21,198
2008 I was actually in Algeria writing

102
00:05:19,038 --> 00:05:23,079
about Jihadi militants when a couple of

103
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:25,439
FBI agents showed up at the New York

104
00:05:23,079 --> 00:05:29,159
Times headquarters looking for me I had

105
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:31,719
been traveling in to Iraq and to the

106
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:34,240
middle East first tormenting the

107
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:36,960
Pentagon for failing to equip American

108
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:40,759
and then Iraqi Soldiers with armor and

109
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:44,719
then looking at how the war in Iraq was

110
00:05:40,759 --> 00:05:46,759
was fueling the ability of recruiters uh

111
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:49,960
in other parts of the world to recruit

112
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:52,919
new jihadis like Abu Omar here whose job

113
00:05:49,959 --> 00:05:56,239
as he showed me was building better and

114
00:05:52,918 --> 00:05:58,839
more uh deadly IEDs to to kill more

115
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:02,400
Americans and I ended up in Algeria

116
00:05:58,839 --> 00:06:04,359
writing about insurgents there uh when

117
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:05,959
the newspaper decided it was probably

118
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:09,038
time for me to come home and find

119
00:06:05,959 --> 00:06:12,318
something safer to do and I mentioned

120
00:06:09,038 --> 00:06:15,800
this really only because I went from one

121
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:17,560
war to another I was having coffee with

122
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:20,759
my editor at the New York Times on the

123
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:24,879
14th floor cafeteria and I think I was

124
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:28,400
still pitching her a story about us arm

125
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:31,319
sales overseas something like that when

126
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:33,959
she said to me you Michael what do you

127
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:36,280
think about

128
00:06:33,959 --> 00:06:38,038
peanuts and I go come on Christy I mean

129
00:06:36,279 --> 00:06:39,959
let me tell you about these missiles and

130
00:06:38,038 --> 00:06:41,800
there's tear gas and it's going here and

131
00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:44,879
she go she goes no no listen to me

132
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:46,879
there's been an outbreak of salmonella

133
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:50,478
in peanuts being

134
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:52,240
manufactured by a factory in Georgia on

135
00:06:50,478 --> 00:06:55,240
the Alabama border and people are

136
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:56,879
getting sick all over the country and

137
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:58,478
I'm still kind of demurring and she's

138
00:06:56,879 --> 00:07:00,120
going look Michael think about it an

139
00:06:58,478 --> 00:07:03,079
investigative editor like to think of

140
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:05,439
bass notes for big potentially big

141
00:07:03,079 --> 00:07:07,079
stories to work on she's look you know

142
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:09,038
these peanuts aren't being manufactured

143
00:07:07,079 --> 00:07:11,399
by China or some other far off place we

144
00:07:09,038 --> 00:07:14,318
can't blame them for this one this is of

145
00:07:11,399 --> 00:07:16,038
our own making thousands of people are

146
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:18,919
being sicken they're even people

147
00:07:16,038 --> 00:07:21,639
starting to die in Most states across

148
00:07:18,918 --> 00:07:26,079
the country and these peanuts are you

149
00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:28,918
being used by as ingredients by this1

150
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:31,439
trillion processed food industry about

151
00:07:28,918 --> 00:07:32,719
which we really really know very little

152
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:34,478
and sure enough when I went down to

153
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:37,000
Georgia and spent some time reporting on

154
00:07:34,478 --> 00:07:39,560
the ground that outbreak became the

155
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:43,879
story about how that industry had lost

156
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:45,720
control over its food chain weeks and

157
00:07:43,879 --> 00:07:47,360
weeks were going by and the largest

158
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:49,159
companies were still trying to figure

159
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,879
out if they were using those peanuts in

160
00:07:49,158 --> 00:07:54,399
their products and then eventually

161
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:57,080
recalling those products to ensure um

162
00:07:54,399 --> 00:08:00,878
safety of consumers and my reporting on

163
00:07:57,079 --> 00:08:04,680
on food safety next took me to um to to

164
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:08,400
Minneapolis Minnesota um where I was

165
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:11,639
incredibly lucky to come across a trove

166
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:14,158
of documents that allowed me for the

167
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:17,879
first time to tell the story of the

168
00:08:14,158 --> 00:08:20,399
making of a hamburger that sickened many

169
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:22,599
people uh because of an eoli

170
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:24,439
contamination including Stephanie Smith

171
00:08:22,598 --> 00:08:27,000
here she was a 22-year-old dance

172
00:08:24,439 --> 00:08:29,879
instructor who had a burger at her mom's

173
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:32,440
house for Sunday supper one week and a

174
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:35,278
week later uh coming out of a a forced

175
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:38,519
coma she was paralyzed from the waist

176
00:08:35,278 --> 00:08:40,559
down because of the of the eoli in the

177
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:42,918
hamburger and and Stephanie allowed me

178
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:46,359
to sort of put a human face on this

179
00:08:42,918 --> 00:08:49,958
Trove of documents and the story of that

180
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:52,560
contamination was an industry that

181
00:08:49,958 --> 00:08:54,879
intentionally avoided knowing about its

182
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:57,838
food chain in order to avoid costly

183
00:08:54,879 --> 00:09:02,399
recalls they did not want to trace back

184
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:04,000
um the hamburger sources to um to the

185
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:06,240
slaughter houses because that would then

186
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,278
be traced forward to other uh other

187
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:11,278
manufacturers in this case it was

188
00:09:08,278 --> 00:09:15,000
Cargill um uh creating the hamburger and

189
00:09:11,278 --> 00:09:18,958
I was I was having dinner with one of my

190
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:22,120
best sources Monsour here who tests

191
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:25,838
pathogens for the meat industry and by

192
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:28,120
the way it was Monsur who Chipotle hired

193
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:30,160
recently to turn its company around from

194
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:32,560
a food safety standpoint me but he said

195
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:36,039
to me you know Michael is as tragic as

196
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:39,518
these episodes of contamination are you

197
00:09:36,039 --> 00:09:41,240
really should look at what my industry

198
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:42,720
he was talking about the imun industry

199
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:45,440
is

200
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:49,040
intentionally adding to its products

201
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:52,519
over which it has absolute control and

202
00:09:49,039 --> 00:09:55,719
he was talking about none other than

203
00:09:52,519 --> 00:09:58,360
Salt especially huge in processed Meats

204
00:09:55,720 --> 00:10:00,839
which got me thinking about sugar and

205
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:03,919
got me thinking about about fat as well

206
00:10:00,839 --> 00:10:05,959
and so that that became the impetus to

207
00:10:03,919 --> 00:10:08,879
the research and the reporting that that

208
00:10:05,958 --> 00:10:10,278
took me through for the book and and one

209
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:13,559
of the first things I had to Grapple

210
00:10:10,278 --> 00:10:17,799
with was well of course we already know

211
00:10:13,559 --> 00:10:21,039
that eating too much of food I like to

212
00:10:17,799 --> 00:10:23,919
call the stuff we hate to love can make

213
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:27,958
us you know unhealthily overweight and

214
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:29,919
otherwise ill but once again I was

215
00:10:27,958 --> 00:10:34,078
amazingly lucky to come AC across a

216
00:10:29,919 --> 00:10:37,879
mountain of documents emails and white

217
00:10:34,078 --> 00:10:40,078
papers and memos and strategy papers

218
00:10:37,879 --> 00:10:43,519
that put me at the table of the largest

219
00:10:40,078 --> 00:10:45,919
food companies in the world as they were

220
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:47,519
formulating and strategizing and

221
00:10:45,919 --> 00:10:49,919
marketing their products and it was

222
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:53,000
those documents that enabled me to

223
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:55,559
identify key players in those companies

224
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:58,159
and then convince them to talk to me and

225
00:10:55,559 --> 00:11:00,638
open up and tell me even more secrets

226
00:10:58,159 --> 00:11:03,919
about their work and and the

227
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:05,399
overwhelming sense of that material in

228
00:11:03,919 --> 00:11:08,159
those interviews which is which is what

229
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:12,320
the book is about is is a sense that

230
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:14,838
this is an industry that's driving 247

231
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:19,120
not just to get us to not just like

232
00:11:14,839 --> 00:11:22,040
their products but to want more and more

233
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:25,278
of them there's no word that they hate

234
00:11:22,039 --> 00:11:27,838
more than than the aw addiction and they

235
00:11:25,278 --> 00:11:31,159
will justifiably argue that look you

236
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:33,639
really can't compare you know Oreos with

237
00:11:31,159 --> 00:11:35,360
with drugs or what have you and and and

238
00:11:33,639 --> 00:11:37,600
I think that there's some validity to

239
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:40,839
that but they don't even need to use the

240
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:43,159
a word in describing their efforts to

241
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:46,240
maximize the Allure of their products

242
00:11:43,159 --> 00:11:49,639
they talk about maximizing

243
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:52,600
snackability and craveability one of my

244
00:11:49,639 --> 00:11:52,600
favorite terms is

245
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:57,679
morish these aren't English Majors right

246
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:59,839
these are bench chemists marketing

247
00:11:57,679 --> 00:12:01,719
people describing their effort and look

248
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:04,480
it's it's not like it's also not like

249
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:06,399
this is this I view this as this evil

250
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:08,920
empire that intentionally set out to

251
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:11,639
make us overweight or otherwise ill I

252
00:12:08,919 --> 00:12:14,039
mean these are companies doing what all

253
00:12:11,639 --> 00:12:16,198
companies want to do which is to make as

254
00:12:14,039 --> 00:12:19,198
much money as possible by selling as

255
00:12:16,198 --> 00:12:21,958
much product as possible the problem

256
00:12:19,198 --> 00:12:25,240
lies in their own sort of deep

257
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:29,319
dependence on using gobs of salt sugar

258
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:30,919
and fat to sort of get to that um get to

259
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:34,079
that sort of Ideal product in their in

260
00:12:30,919 --> 00:12:36,078
their eyes which is low cost convenient

261
00:12:34,078 --> 00:12:39,439
and utterly

262
00:12:36,078 --> 00:12:41,638
irresistible um I was incredibly uh

263
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:43,959
lucky to spend time with a legend in the

264
00:12:41,639 --> 00:12:46,360
industry named Howard mosow which who's

265
00:12:43,958 --> 00:12:48,638
responsible for many of the icons in the

266
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:50,199
grocery store he was trained in high

267
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:52,399
math at Queens College and then

268
00:12:50,198 --> 00:12:55,240
experimental psychology at Harvard and

269
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:58,278
and Howard walked me through one of his

270
00:12:55,240 --> 00:13:02,198
recent Creations which was a new soda

271
00:12:58,278 --> 00:13:05,480
flavor for Dr Pepper in which he started

272
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:07,559
with no less than 60 versions of

273
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:09,159
sweetness each one just slightly

274
00:13:07,559 --> 00:13:11,958
different than the next and subjected

275
00:13:09,159 --> 00:13:13,759
those to his 3,000 plus consumer taste

276
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:16,679
tests around the country and then took

277
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:19,039
the data thre it in his computer did his

278
00:13:16,679 --> 00:13:22,559
high math regression analysis thing and

279
00:13:19,039 --> 00:13:24,240
out came uh typically charts like this a

280
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:26,679
bell-shaped curve where at the top of

281
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:29,560
the curve is not the dreaded middle C

282
00:13:26,679 --> 00:13:32,719
you get in school but rather the perfect

283
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:35,399
amount of sweetness not too little not

284
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:38,240
too much it was Howard moscowitz who

285
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:40,679
coined the term the Bliss point to

286
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:42,600
describe that perfect amount of

287
00:13:40,679 --> 00:13:44,359
sweetness and when you talk to

288
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:47,079
nutritionists you realize that the

289
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:50,079
problem is not that the food industry

290
00:13:47,078 --> 00:13:52,479
has created or in Howard's word

291
00:13:50,078 --> 00:13:55,679
engineered Bliss points for things like

292
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:57,920
ice cream and cookies and soda things we

293
00:13:55,679 --> 00:14:00,519
know and expect to be sweet it's that

294
00:13:57,919 --> 00:14:03,479
they've marched around the grocery store

295
00:14:00,519 --> 00:14:06,519
adding sugar to products that didn't

296
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:09,480
used to be sweet before so now breads

297
00:14:06,519 --> 00:14:11,480
have added sugar and an engineered Bliss

298
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:14,199
point for sweetness some yogurts can

299
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:16,879
still have as much sugar pres serving as

300
00:14:14,198 --> 00:14:18,559
ice cream one of my favorite spots in

301
00:14:16,879 --> 00:14:20,439
the grocery store is the pasta sauce

302
00:14:18,559 --> 00:14:22,119
aisle where some Brands can have the

303
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:24,279
equivalent of a couple of Oreo cookies

304
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:28,240
with a sweetness and a tiny half cup

305
00:14:24,278 --> 00:14:32,320
serving and what this does is teach us

306
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:35,159
to EXP respect sweetness in everything

307
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:37,079
we eat which is a real problem for kids

308
00:14:35,159 --> 00:14:39,399
especially because they are born

309
00:14:37,078 --> 00:14:42,519
hardwired for sweet taste so when you

310
00:14:39,399 --> 00:14:44,320
drag them over to the produce aisle and

311
00:14:42,519 --> 00:14:49,480
try to get them interested in things

312
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:53,120
like brussel sprouts and celery and

313
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:57,519
broccoli you're going to get a rebellion

314
00:14:53,120 --> 00:15:01,440
on your hands um but it's not just sugar

315
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:04,039
of course if if you were to draw a drug

316
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:06,079
analogy which I hesitate to do but if

317
00:15:04,039 --> 00:15:10,159
you were to compare sugar to

318
00:15:06,078 --> 00:15:14,758
amphetamine fat to the food industry is

319
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:18,639
the opiate for its also very powerful

320
00:15:14,759 --> 00:15:20,440
very subtle way of sneaking up on you

321
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:23,198
not with a bliss point but with what the

322
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:26,839
industry calls the mouth feel because as

323
00:15:23,198 --> 00:15:30,159
you all know um fats are still not quite

324
00:15:26,839 --> 00:15:31,360
accepted as an official taste but rather

325
00:15:30,159 --> 00:15:33,799
that

326
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:36,360
sensation uh thanks to the trigeminal

327
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:37,519
nerve of biting into a warm toasted

328
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:39,919
cheese

329
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:42,959
sandwich you can tell I'm a bit of a

330
00:15:39,919 --> 00:15:45,759
salt and fat guy cuz the reward center

331
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:48,479
of my brain is going off because that's

332
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:51,318
connected to the to the to the pleasure

333
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:53,159
centers of your brain just as much as as

334
00:15:51,318 --> 00:15:56,759
as sugar is and one of the things the

335
00:15:53,159 --> 00:16:00,480
industry learned with fat is I write in

336
00:15:56,759 --> 00:16:02,360
the book that they could use the excess

337
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:05,720
processed cheese that they were

338
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:09,480
generating as an ingredient in processed

339
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:11,440
foods to increase the Allure of those

340
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:15,560
products and so that's why sandwich

341
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:17,839
shops U through a very strategic um uh

342
00:16:15,559 --> 00:16:20,198
joint venture between industry and the

343
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:22,079
government began offering and promoting

344
00:16:20,198 --> 00:16:23,318
and marketing cheese on Every Sandwich

345
00:16:22,078 --> 00:16:24,838
you eat and you can walk through the

346
00:16:23,318 --> 00:16:28,318
grocery store and so many products now

347
00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:31,040
have added cheese in it not not cheese

348
00:16:28,318 --> 00:16:34,799
for its own lovely sense of eating but

349
00:16:31,039 --> 00:16:36,120
cheese as an added ingredient with those

350
00:16:34,799 --> 00:16:38,679
those extra

351
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:41,000
calories and then there's salt of course

352
00:16:38,679 --> 00:16:43,318
which is a strange creature I don't even

353
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,799
know what the drug analogy to salt is I

354
00:16:43,318 --> 00:16:46,958
mean these days it's methadone because

355
00:16:45,799 --> 00:16:50,159
they're they're trying to come up with

356
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:52,479
salt substitutes right because our salt

357
00:16:50,159 --> 00:16:55,399
consumption typically is like so much

358
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:57,199
higher than than certainly some some

359
00:16:55,399 --> 00:16:59,559
scientists think we we we should be

360
00:16:57,198 --> 00:17:02,198
eating because of the the links to high

361
00:16:59,559 --> 00:17:06,720
blood pressure and and and heart disease

362
00:17:02,198 --> 00:17:08,359
um but the real eyeopener for me was was

363
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:11,000
the moment when I asked some of the

364
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:14,000
larger food companies why are you using

365
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:16,400
so much salt not in things I expect to

366
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,838
be salty but just in your your across

367
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:22,079
theboard processed foods and none other

368
00:17:18,838 --> 00:17:24,798
than Kelloggs invited me in to show me

369
00:17:22,078 --> 00:17:27,720
what salt meant to them and not only did

370
00:17:24,798 --> 00:17:30,679
I get to tour their R&amp;D Factory but they

371
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:32,919
sat me down and prepared for me special

372
00:17:30,679 --> 00:17:35,519
versions of some of the biggest icons in

373
00:17:32,919 --> 00:17:38,880
the grocery store without using any salt

374
00:17:35,519 --> 00:17:41,599
in them at all and so we started with

375
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:43,000
the um we started with the Chee itss

376
00:17:41,599 --> 00:17:44,918
which I managed to take a little

377
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:48,599
snapshot of here normally I could eat

378
00:17:44,919 --> 00:17:51,640
those day in day out but without salt we

379
00:17:48,599 --> 00:17:54,279
couldn't even swallow them they tasted

380
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:57,840
they stuck rather to the roof of our

381
00:17:54,279 --> 00:18:00,279
mouth because salt adds texture and

382
00:17:57,839 --> 00:18:02,158
solubility we moved on to the frozen

383
00:18:00,279 --> 00:18:05,279
waffles put them in the toaster and they

384
00:18:02,159 --> 00:18:09,200
came out looking and tasting Like Straw

385
00:18:05,279 --> 00:18:11,918
because salt adds color and flavor and

386
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:13,600
then we moved on to the Corn Flakes put

387
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:16,919
them in the bowl added some water taste

388
00:18:13,599 --> 00:18:18,678
a took a took a took a bite and before I

389
00:18:16,919 --> 00:18:19,919
could say anything the chief spokeswoman

390
00:18:18,679 --> 00:18:22,919
for the company was sitting there she

391
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:25,200
gets this look of horror on her face and

392
00:18:22,919 --> 00:18:29,240
she swallows and blurts out the word

393
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:31,720
metal I taste metal m e t a l the chief

394
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:33,359
technical officer is there and he starts

395
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:35,159
chuckling and goes yeah not not

396
00:18:33,359 --> 00:18:37,240
everybody will get this but one of the

397
00:18:35,159 --> 00:18:40,039
one of the beautiful things that makes

398
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:44,200
salt such a miracle ingredient to us is

399
00:18:40,038 --> 00:18:46,759
that it will mask some of the off notes

400
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:49,720
bad taste that are inherent to some

401
00:18:46,759 --> 00:18:52,759
processed foods in this case some of the

402
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:55,798
added minerals to the Corn Flakes would

403
00:18:52,759 --> 00:18:59,000
give you what I had a sensation of one

404
00:18:55,798 --> 00:19:01,720
of my fillings coming loose and sloshing

405
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:06,480
around in my mouth and that's when I

406
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:10,880
really got it which is as dependent as

407
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:15,279
we become on large amounts of salt sugar

408
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:17,400
fat the industry itself is even more

409
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:19,399
dependent on them which is a real

410
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:22,400
problem for it now because those same

411
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:25,120
companies like Nestle are now trying to

412
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:27,640
change um but I went on with nestling

413
00:19:25,119 --> 00:19:31,439
and said look as you guys know it's not

414
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:33,960
just salt sugar that it's the marketing

415
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:37,919
of course that goes into the products

416
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:40,640
and increasingly marketing people began

417
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:42,840
to run the largest food companies I had

418
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:45,520
a wonderful time with Ed Martin who was

419
00:19:42,839 --> 00:19:47,599
part of a SWAT team at Kelloggs when

420
00:19:45,519 --> 00:19:49,759
they were losing market share to General

421
00:19:47,599 --> 00:19:51,839
Mills and he told me how they sat around

422
00:19:49,759 --> 00:19:55,200
one day and they schemed up this thing

423
00:19:51,839 --> 00:19:57,119
called Rice Crispies treat cereal and

424
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:59,360
they they they and and they thought

425
00:19:57,119 --> 00:20:00,959
that's a great idea let's give it to the

426
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:02,839
technicians and let them work it out and

427
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:05,120
the poor technicians came back and

428
00:20:02,839 --> 00:20:06,720
pulling their hair out said we can't do

429
00:20:05,119 --> 00:20:09,000
it I mean every time we tried to add

430
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:13,400
marshmallow to the cereal it turns to

431
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:15,200
Mush and mush is the death of cereal so

432
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:16,960
the marketing people went back to their

433
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,919
Consumer Panel and said look we can't

434
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:21,759
quite do this guys help us out and they

435
00:20:18,919 --> 00:20:23,159
said well look you don't really have to

436
00:20:21,759 --> 00:20:26,440
give us

437
00:20:23,159 --> 00:20:29,640
marshmallow you you you can probably

438
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:34,240
just give us the sensation of of

439
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:37,679
marshmallow The Taste the flavor or the

440
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:40,240
smell and that'll be powerful enough for

441
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:43,480
us in the co the industry coin the term

442
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:46,679
permission we will give you permission

443
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:49,798
to fool us if you just get close enough

444
00:20:46,679 --> 00:20:51,360
to the real thing rice s treat cereal

445
00:20:49,798 --> 00:20:55,079
without the real marshmallows became a

446
00:20:51,359 --> 00:20:56,959
huge hit for for Kelloggs um I spent a

447
00:20:55,079 --> 00:20:59,079
whole chapter on the Lunchables because

448
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:00,640
it's just it's just absolutely

449
00:20:59,079 --> 00:21:02,240
fascinating I got I got to meet and

450
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:05,759
spend lots of time with the inventor of

451
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:09,440
the Lunchables Bob Dr Who who just you

452
00:21:05,759 --> 00:21:12,599
know who who who who was still amazed to

453
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:15,480
this day that they managed to turn you

454
00:21:12,599 --> 00:21:18,278
know little pieces of processed cheese

455
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:20,120
and processed meat and crackers

456
00:21:18,278 --> 00:21:23,079
something nobody would be even

457
00:21:20,119 --> 00:21:26,479
interested in eating necessarily into a

458
00:21:23,079 --> 00:21:29,359
billion doll a year brand that kids

459
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:32,519
would get excited about but at one point

460
00:21:29,359 --> 00:21:34,959
in the process they learned and decided

461
00:21:32,519 --> 00:21:38,000
and were were sort of known for saying

462
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:40,640
among themselves that that they realized

463
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:44,880
that Lunchables wasn't about the food as

464
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:47,840
much as it was the badge value the the

465
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:50,159
the the the great Buzz that gave to the

466
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:53,278
kid who pulled one of these Lunchables

467
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:56,278
out on the lunchroom he or she became

468
00:21:53,278 --> 00:21:57,839
the cats meow of the lunchroom and so

469
00:21:56,278 --> 00:22:00,599
they came up with that slogan for the

470
00:21:57,839 --> 00:22:05,359
kids all day you got to do what they say

471
00:22:00,599 --> 00:22:07,480
but lunchtime is all yours the food

472
00:22:05,359 --> 00:22:09,719
industry is incredibly smart about

473
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:13,759
hitting finding and hitting those

474
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:16,480
emotional buttons which really for for

475
00:22:13,759 --> 00:22:22,158
for for much of the time is what drives

476
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:26,679
us to to to um to eat and then of course

477
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:29,159
there was Jeffrey Dunn for 20 years he

478
00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:32,798
was the fiercest

479
00:22:29,159 --> 00:22:36,320
Warrior at this company he rose to

480
00:22:32,798 --> 00:22:39,480
become president of cocacola for North

481
00:22:36,319 --> 00:22:41,599
America South America Jeffrey Dunn

482
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:44,038
walked me through K's pioneering of the

483
00:22:41,599 --> 00:22:45,839
suis me phenomena where they they

484
00:22:44,038 --> 00:22:48,640
decided they could make more money by

485
00:22:45,839 --> 00:22:51,558
offering unlimited amounts of drink uh

486
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:53,038
soda Coca-Cola to people in restaurants

487
00:22:51,558 --> 00:22:55,879
because really the ingredients didn't

488
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:59,119
cost that more even for the Mega sizes

489
00:22:55,880 --> 00:23:02,360
um the the warlike language wage they

490
00:22:59,119 --> 00:23:03,959
used in their competition with Pepsi

491
00:23:02,359 --> 00:23:05,798
where they would refer to their best

492
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:08,000
customers people who would drink two or

493
00:23:05,798 --> 00:23:11,038
three Cokes a day or more not as their

494
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:14,558
best customers but as heavy

495
00:23:11,038 --> 00:23:17,440
users and and they're targeting of

496
00:23:14,558 --> 00:23:19,960
people like Tatiana here um who I caught

497
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:23,080
up within a corner store in Philadelphia

498
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:24,880
knowing that when kids walk into a store

499
00:23:23,079 --> 00:23:27,599
with a little bit of their own spending

500
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:29,880
money and make those first decisions

501
00:23:27,599 --> 00:23:32,918
about what to buy they will become

502
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:36,480
imprinted on that product on that brand

503
00:23:32,919 --> 00:23:39,480
and that's why Coke the Envy of solid

504
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:43,079
food manufacturers around the world

505
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:47,640
focused so hard on putting Cokes in the

506
00:23:43,079 --> 00:23:50,399
hands of kids at ballparks knowing that

507
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:53,000
sort of that joyous moment of a kid

508
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:54,679
being with their parent and getting that

509
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:59,200
product in their hand it was worth was

510
00:23:54,679 --> 00:24:02,759
worth gazillions in advertising um in

511
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:05,080
implanting that that wonderful memory in

512
00:24:02,759 --> 00:24:08,599
in the kid's head

513
00:24:05,079 --> 00:24:12,038
um and of course there's the analogy to

514
00:24:08,599 --> 00:24:14,240
Tobacco which isn't just an analogy many

515
00:24:12,038 --> 00:24:18,000
of us have forgotten that back in the

516
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:20,120
1980s the largest tobacco company in

517
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:23,440
North America eventually the world

518
00:24:20,119 --> 00:24:26,439
became the largest food manufacturer

519
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:29,080
Philip Morris through its acquisition of

520
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:32,798
General Foods the old food conglomerate

521
00:24:29,079 --> 00:24:35,759
out of New York um and craft and I was

522
00:24:32,798 --> 00:24:39,440
lucky to spend time with um some of the

523
00:24:35,759 --> 00:24:42,798
some of the former CEOs of Philip Morris

524
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:45,798
explaining to me how they lent some of

525
00:24:42,798 --> 00:24:50,079
their marketing practices for cigarettes

526
00:24:45,798 --> 00:24:52,879
to their food managers um at craft and

527
00:24:50,079 --> 00:24:54,960
general foods which also led me to write

528
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:56,520
about in the beginning of the book sort

529
00:24:54,960 --> 00:25:00,360
of this this

530
00:24:56,519 --> 00:25:03,200
wonderfully powerful moment back in

531
00:25:00,359 --> 00:25:07,359
1999 when the heads of the largest food

532
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:09,480
companies got together privately by

533
00:25:07,359 --> 00:25:10,759
brought together by cabals of insiders

534
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:12,798
within their own companies who are

535
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:16,240
becoming increasingly concerned about

536
00:25:12,798 --> 00:25:18,519
their culpability in the growing obesity

537
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:20,839
not just obesity but other Health crisis

538
00:25:18,519 --> 00:25:22,639
and up before them stands a senior

539
00:25:20,839 --> 00:25:25,398
official at the biggest company of all

540
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:27,200
craft he's armed with 72 slides

541
00:25:25,398 --> 00:25:30,199
including this one here that he's

542
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:32,640
showing to the CEO and he lays at their

543
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:36,798
feet responsibility not just for the

544
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:40,080
growing um obesity situation but

545
00:25:36,798 --> 00:25:42,879
diabetes uh gout several types of

546
00:25:40,079 --> 00:25:46,519
cancers and he pleads with the

547
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:50,320
executives to start doing something

548
00:25:46,519 --> 00:25:53,398
meaningful to turn a corner and in part

549
00:25:50,319 --> 00:25:56,038
reformulate their products to be truly

550
00:25:53,398 --> 00:25:57,398
healthier um he sits down and as I write

551
00:25:56,038 --> 00:26:00,519
in the book one of the biggest most

552
00:25:57,398 --> 00:26:05,000
powerful CEOs in the room stands up and

553
00:26:00,519 --> 00:26:07,798
is visibly angry and says look we are

554
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:09,880
already sensitive to what consumers want

555
00:26:07,798 --> 00:26:12,000
if they want a low fat this or a low

556
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:14,840
sugar this we make it it's on the Shelf

557
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:18,798
there they have options but you've got

558
00:26:14,839 --> 00:26:21,119
to remember that we are also beholden to

559
00:26:18,798 --> 00:26:23,038
shareholders and there is no way we're

560
00:26:21,119 --> 00:26:27,439
going to mess around with the company

561
00:26:23,038 --> 00:26:28,879
Jewels referring to salt sugar fat if

562
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:32,360
that's uh

563
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:34,919
if that's going to lead to lower sales

564
00:26:32,359 --> 00:26:38,199
because we would not be responsible then

565
00:26:34,919 --> 00:26:41,720
to those shareholders and by and large

566
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:44,278
that's still the basic story of the food

567
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:46,839
industry today even though it's changing

568
00:26:44,278 --> 00:26:49,880
oh and because it was Nestle I reminded

569
00:26:46,839 --> 00:26:52,480
them that they uh were sending boats

570
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:55,840
like this up and down the

571
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:57,558
Amazon finding new ways to Market their

572
00:26:55,839 --> 00:27:00,918
products to people who were still

573
00:26:57,558 --> 00:27:03,398
entirely cooking by scratch figuring out

574
00:27:00,919 --> 00:27:04,880
they they could sell many versions of

575
00:27:03,398 --> 00:27:09,000
their products and all the big companies

576
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:15,120
are doing it um uh to the emerging

577
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:19,159
middle class in uh in Brazil um and then

578
00:27:15,119 --> 00:27:23,199
I sat down and I spent the next two days

579
00:27:19,159 --> 00:27:26,360
at Nestle oh by the way to some some

580
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:28,840
mild mildly Pleasant Applause from the

581
00:27:26,359 --> 00:27:30,759
the R&amp;D people uh

582
00:27:28,839 --> 00:27:34,240
spending time with them looking at sort

583
00:27:30,759 --> 00:27:35,679
of what they were doing to reformulate

584
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:38,359
their products and I have to say it was

585
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:40,640
it was fairly impressive I mean they're

586
00:27:38,359 --> 00:27:43,079
taking they're they're they're trying to

587
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:45,919
minimize or reduce the amount of salt

588
00:27:43,079 --> 00:27:49,240
that they're using by um by taking it

589
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:51,320
out of products internally and

590
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:54,759
concentrating it on the surface of

591
00:27:51,319 --> 00:27:57,398
products so it provides that that that

592
00:27:54,759 --> 00:27:59,200
um what the industry calls flavor burst

593
00:27:57,398 --> 00:28:00,959
sort of immediate medely to the tongue

594
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:03,000
and the live and the reward center so

595
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:04,919
you can get basically more bang for your

596
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:08,839
buck um they showed me how they were

597
00:28:04,919 --> 00:28:13,320
taking fat globules and expanding the

598
00:28:08,839 --> 00:28:16,759
surface area um so you would have more

599
00:28:13,319 --> 00:28:20,918
contact of the fat with your mouth for

600
00:28:16,759 --> 00:28:23,119
again bigger mouth feel bang for the uh

601
00:28:20,919 --> 00:28:25,919
for the buck and of course how they were

602
00:28:23,119 --> 00:28:28,798
trying to replace caloric sweeteners

603
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:30,919
with with non-caloric sweeteners

604
00:28:28,798 --> 00:28:32,359
in changing some of their products like

605
00:28:30,919 --> 00:28:38,320
the like the hot

606
00:28:32,359 --> 00:28:40,759
pets but but here's kind of the rub and

607
00:28:38,319 --> 00:28:42,798
and in in in some ways I have a bit of a

608
00:28:40,759 --> 00:28:46,158
confession too because as much as I

609
00:28:42,798 --> 00:28:49,359
focused on salt sugar fat and as much as

610
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:50,799
I talked about the solution to the

611
00:28:49,359 --> 00:28:53,119
problem of companies adding too much

612
00:28:50,798 --> 00:28:55,440
salt sugar fat is obviously reducing the

613
00:28:53,119 --> 00:28:57,639
salt sugar fat when you talk to

614
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:59,880
nutritionists that's typically not the

615
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:02,440
first thing that they say to you the

616
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:07,679
first thing they will say to you is that

617
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:12,000
we all need to be doubling the amount of

618
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:14,159
this stuff that we eat um and if we do

619
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:17,240
that we're going to be way more than

620
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:20,000
halfway home to to Better Health from

621
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:22,200
the food that we have um and and and

622
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:25,558
kind of even the rest of the stuff will

623
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:28,720
start to some extent taking care of of

624
00:29:25,558 --> 00:29:30,879
itself and so I started and when I asked

625
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:32,919
nesle about that and there scientists I

626
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:35,278
said look okay I appreciate that you're

627
00:29:32,919 --> 00:29:37,360
reducing the salt sugar and fat and

628
00:29:35,278 --> 00:29:39,720
these products but but what are you

629
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:44,398
doing to stuff the Hot Pockets with this

630
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:46,679
stuff I got a Blank Stare because in

631
00:29:44,398 --> 00:29:49,000
fact that's one of the most difficult

632
00:29:46,679 --> 00:29:52,600
things for the processed food industry

633
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:54,519
now which is not decreasing the bad boy

634
00:29:52,599 --> 00:29:57,319
ingredients in their products it's

635
00:29:54,519 --> 00:29:58,679
increasing the good stuff is a real

636
00:29:57,319 --> 00:30:01,158
challenge for them

637
00:29:58,679 --> 00:30:03,360
and so I started thinking about

638
00:30:01,159 --> 00:30:06,720
well what

639
00:30:03,359 --> 00:30:09,240
would what would my food Giants exuse

640
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:13,558
the possessive what would my food Giants

641
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:17,440
do if they suddenly had to start

642
00:30:13,558 --> 00:30:19,639
selling fresh vegetables and fruit and

643
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:21,519
the and the and the cynics Among Us

644
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:25,080
would probably guess well they would

645
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:28,120
smother them with cheese sauce or fried

646
00:30:25,079 --> 00:30:29,720
caramel glazing but no if the rules was

647
00:30:28,119 --> 00:30:31,959
they had to sell produce as it was

648
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:33,919
without ruining the nutritional profile

649
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:35,960
of the what would they do and I'm

650
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:39,000
convinced they would sort of go to their

651
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:42,278
tried and true three things that make

652
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:44,640
processed food so um so successful they

653
00:30:42,278 --> 00:30:48,278
would make it more convenient they would

654
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:50,399
make it um they would make it more um

655
00:30:48,278 --> 00:30:53,398
more lower C they would lower the cost

656
00:30:50,398 --> 00:30:54,759
of it and they would do things to make

657
00:30:53,398 --> 00:30:57,199
it if not

658
00:30:54,759 --> 00:31:00,038
irresistible at least more interesting

659
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:03,080
in order to increase consumption um and

660
00:31:00,038 --> 00:31:06,278
I think probably you know for the for

661
00:31:03,079 --> 00:31:09,079
the for the lower the cost they would go

662
00:31:06,278 --> 00:31:10,798
to the agricultural community and say

663
00:31:09,079 --> 00:31:13,839
hey guys remember how we told you to

664
00:31:10,798 --> 00:31:17,119
grow soybeans and field corn which are

665
00:31:13,839 --> 00:31:20,678
the Staples of our Foods forget that we

666
00:31:17,119 --> 00:31:23,398
want you to grow fresh vegetables and

667
00:31:20,679 --> 00:31:26,440
fruits now and sure enough in the

668
00:31:23,398 --> 00:31:29,678
midwest I ran across a extension

669
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:32,278
programs which were teaching field corn

670
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:35,038
and soybean Farmers how to switch over

671
00:31:32,278 --> 00:31:37,960
to grow vegetables and

672
00:31:35,038 --> 00:31:41,558
increase increased Supply if not demand

673
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:45,200
in that way um lo and behold I also ran

674
00:31:41,558 --> 00:31:49,278
across your very own Thomas borkman here

675
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:51,558
who is working on the R&amp;D end of things

676
00:31:49,278 --> 00:31:54,159
because last time I looked the industry

677
00:31:51,558 --> 00:31:56,720
was spending $2 billion a year on

678
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:59,919
research and development to make soy and

679
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:02,798
corn more profit a for farmers and I had

680
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:05,200
trouble coming up with a mere $100

681
00:32:02,798 --> 00:32:09,200
million in research and development for

682
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:11,600
all vegetables and fruits and that's an

683
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:13,080
that's an uneven playing field that's

684
00:32:11,599 --> 00:32:15,359
very significant so I'm convinced that

685
00:32:13,079 --> 00:32:18,199
my food Giants would increase the amount

686
00:32:15,359 --> 00:32:20,278
of money they put into Research into

687
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:24,840
science to make

688
00:32:20,278 --> 00:32:28,079
vegetables more attractive more tasty

689
00:32:24,839 --> 00:32:32,119
fresher more longlasting if you will on

690
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:33,678
the Shelf um and um and then also I'm

691
00:32:32,119 --> 00:32:35,359
convinced that they would sort of fiddle

692
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:37,600
around with the grocery store and they

693
00:32:35,359 --> 00:32:40,359
ran across these These Guys in New

694
00:32:37,599 --> 00:32:42,079
Mexico practicing nudge marketing they

695
00:32:40,359 --> 00:32:44,199
were going into supermarkets and

696
00:32:42,079 --> 00:32:46,439
fiddling with the grocery cart and they

697
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:50,159
did some experiments where they in fact

698
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:52,159
um these these um one of these one of

699
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:55,399
these um scientists came out of the

700
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:58,240
Cornell Food Lab actually um Colin Payne

701
00:32:55,398 --> 00:32:59,599
and um did an experiment where he put

702
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:01,798
some duct tape down the middle of a

703
00:32:59,599 --> 00:33:04,319
grocery cart and a sign in the front

704
00:33:01,798 --> 00:33:06,158
saying put your vegetables in the front

705
00:33:04,319 --> 00:33:09,960
half of the shopping cart and that

706
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:12,240
little nudge led to a doubling in

707
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:14,480
produce sales in the grocery stores

708
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:16,440
where they did this experiments but he

709
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:19,720
also was playing around when I caught up

710
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:22,120
with him by putting with putting mirrors

711
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:25,360
in the front of the

712
00:33:22,119 --> 00:33:28,038
cart cuz the idea is when you walk into

713
00:33:25,359 --> 00:33:30,959
the grocery store everything about it is

714
00:33:28,038 --> 00:33:35,038
designed to sort of get you off your

715
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:37,399
game plan and make spontaneous purchase

716
00:33:35,038 --> 00:33:40,240
decisions and to kind of forget about

717
00:33:37,398 --> 00:33:42,439
who you are so his idea was if we could

718
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:44,399
remind people of who they were as

719
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:46,519
they're shopping in the store they'll

720
00:33:44,398 --> 00:33:48,479
reconnect kind of with the consequences

721
00:33:46,519 --> 00:33:51,759
of those purchase decisions and remember

722
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:55,159
the reality outside the store instead

723
00:33:51,759 --> 00:33:58,079
what you get is this law law music and

724
00:33:55,159 --> 00:33:59,799
and bright colors and so again of this

725
00:33:58,079 --> 00:34:01,119
law law atmosphere so he's starting

726
00:33:59,798 --> 00:34:03,278
picturing and I love this one because

727
00:34:01,119 --> 00:34:05,319
this is a this photo is reflecting the

728
00:34:03,278 --> 00:34:07,480
image of the person uh pushing the cart

729
00:34:05,319 --> 00:34:09,358
he was in Al Paso and and the mirror

730
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:11,960
that they had come up with was was was

731
00:34:09,358 --> 00:34:15,159
sort of um was rectangular and he had

732
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:18,440
suggested turning it this way so he

733
00:34:15,159 --> 00:34:22,039
would get the image of this part of his

734
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:25,039
body because he had a very uh

735
00:34:22,039 --> 00:34:26,480
substantial stomach but the real biggest

736
00:34:25,039 --> 00:34:28,519
thing I think that the food joints would

737
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:31,000
do to increase consumption of fruits and

738
00:34:28,519 --> 00:34:34,800
vegetables would be to turn to their

739
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:39,960
tried and true friends on Madison Avenue

740
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:43,560
and find those emotional buttons to push

741
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:46,760
that could drive consumption of

742
00:34:43,559 --> 00:34:50,759
vegetables like they drive consumption

743
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:54,359
of Snickers bars and what have you um

744
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:59,440
so it took a while but I managed to find

745
00:34:54,358 --> 00:35:04,279
an advertising firm to do an ad campaign

746
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:08,760
for me um uh for a vegetable and and and

747
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:13,720
not any vegetable but I settled on a

748
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:16,160
vegetable that tends to tends to cause

749
00:35:13,719 --> 00:35:19,039
issues for a good number of people

750
00:35:16,159 --> 00:35:21,679
especially of my generation if they had

751
00:35:19,039 --> 00:35:24,320
parents who cooked it to Mush and then

752
00:35:21,679 --> 00:35:26,118
made you and then made you eat it and

753
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:28,519
not only that but this advertising

754
00:35:26,119 --> 00:35:31,280
agency agreed to do this campaign

755
00:35:28,519 --> 00:35:34,480
and let me watch them do it and

756
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:40,040
videotape it and it was like being

757
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:41,639
inside a Mad Men and woman segment where

758
00:35:40,039 --> 00:35:43,920
they're where they're doing their sort

759
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:46,960
of Genius thing and so I'm going to show

760
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:48,920
you a couple of Snippets of the of the

761
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:51,838
video that we made of their process

762
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:56,559
trying to come up with this um this

763
00:35:51,838 --> 00:35:56,559
campaign for the problem vegetable

764
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:03,280
I do not like broccoli and I haven't

765
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:05,400
liked it since I was a little kid and my

766
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:07,280
mother made me eat it and I'm president

767
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:08,480
of the United States and I'm not going

768
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:11,560
to eat

769
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:15,199
any I hope you remember that guy well

770
00:36:11,559 --> 00:36:17,838
health brocc is not a popular vegetable

771
00:36:15,199 --> 00:36:19,799
it was dered by President George Bush

772
00:36:17,838 --> 00:36:22,199
and it's pretty much ignored by the rest

773
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:24,119
of us I'm Michael moss and I WR about

774
00:36:22,199 --> 00:36:26,679
the intersection of food and marketing

775
00:36:24,119 --> 00:36:31,720
for New York time I'm trying to answer a

776
00:36:26,679 --> 00:36:33,960
question it take to get people better

777
00:36:31,719 --> 00:36:37,719
advertising whose previous clients

778
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:39,400
includ T generals and cocacola took on

779
00:36:37,719 --> 00:36:41,679
the challenge pro

780
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:43,800
bono okay and about halfway through the

781
00:36:41,679 --> 00:36:45,759
process um and this went on for weeks

782
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:48,318
and weeks I mean these are people who

783
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:49,800
can turn around and ad for Porsche in

784
00:36:48,318 --> 00:36:52,159
like a couple of days but they were

785
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:54,318
pulling their hair out and and because

786
00:36:52,159 --> 00:36:57,799
this was like a real challenge I mean

787
00:36:54,318 --> 00:37:02,199
it's one thing to sell junkie stuff or

788
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:03,599
speed or sex to people but broccoli but

789
00:37:02,199 --> 00:37:05,399
at one point they decided okay look

790
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:06,960
Michael you're not giving us any money

791
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:09,599
but even in the real world we probably

792
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:11,400
wouldn't have money for prime time TV we

793
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:13,760
got to like start slowly here let's

794
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:15,800
let's do some social media campaigns

795
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:18,200
stuff and let's we're going to pick a

796
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:20,839
fight with another product in the

797
00:37:18,199 --> 00:37:23,199
grocery store and I thought oh boy

798
00:37:20,838 --> 00:37:25,639
they're going to go after you know one

799
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:27,078
of my favorites potato chips or maybe

800
00:37:25,639 --> 00:37:28,719
they're going to go after french fries

801
00:37:27,079 --> 00:37:31,480
in the restaur restaurant and they go no

802
00:37:28,719 --> 00:37:34,199
no no no no you're forgetting your own

803
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:37,800
book remember how you wrote about how

804
00:37:34,199 --> 00:37:40,960
the supposed war between Pepsi and

805
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:43,480
cocacola was like a bloody war and in

806
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:45,880
fact it was totally bloodless because

807
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:48,719
those two companies figured out that

808
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:50,920
every time they attacked each other or

809
00:37:48,719 --> 00:37:54,118
every time Pepsi got Michael Jackson to

810
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:57,039
come up with a new ad the sales of both

811
00:37:54,119 --> 00:38:02,079
companies would rise because it brought

812
00:37:57,039 --> 00:38:05,079
Buzz to the soda aisle and so they

813
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:08,400
decided to pick a fight with somebody

814
00:38:05,079 --> 00:38:11,880
else in the grocery store and this is a

815
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:13,880
video snippet of these mad men and women

816
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:16,358
actually at work sitting around the

817
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:18,599
table trying to come up with this with

818
00:38:16,358 --> 00:38:21,039
this uh campaign

819
00:38:18,599 --> 00:38:22,720
strategy so our key consumer inut that

820
00:38:21,039 --> 00:38:25,119
we're working with is that everyone is

821
00:38:22,719 --> 00:38:27,799
currently talking about chaos um it is

822
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:29,559
everywhere this is bone Appetit magazine

823
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:32,000
there's a whole section on the vegetable

824
00:38:29,559 --> 00:38:33,960
revolution in here and there's a

825
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:36,480
timeline around when all of these

826
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:39,039
vegetables had their it moments broccoli

827
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:40,960
is not on the SL there's nothing new or

828
00:38:39,039 --> 00:38:43,599
exciting to say about broccoli our

829
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:46,240
challenge is going to be how to change

830
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:49,720
the visual communication the visual

831
00:38:46,239 --> 00:38:50,959
style of broccoli in culture that wall

832
00:38:49,719 --> 00:38:55,078
over there

833
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:56,639
broccoli cool maybe be cool not cool you

834
00:38:55,079 --> 00:38:58,519
don't want to D anyone but maybe you

835
00:38:56,639 --> 00:39:00,598
know maybe there joke I mean the fact

836
00:38:58,519 --> 00:39:03,239
that BR is having it own campaign I

837
00:39:00,599 --> 00:39:06,000
think you can have a lot of fun

838
00:39:03,239 --> 00:39:07,519
with so you Rec like I like you to live

839
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,920
longer here's something that's going to

840
00:39:07,519 --> 00:39:12,800
do

841
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:12,800
that probably a better GI

842
00:39:13,679 --> 00:39:19,279
than so that drops out at the end but he

843
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:21,400
said is it a bro okay

844
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:23,200
so this is how these you know

845
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:26,000
advertising people you know get their

846
00:39:23,199 --> 00:39:30,199
juices up by sitting around thinking of

847
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:34,559
silly things like that but in fact they

848
00:39:30,199 --> 00:39:36,838
came up with a campaign um I came up

849
00:39:34,559 --> 00:39:38,480
with a story this is it landed on the

850
00:39:36,838 --> 00:39:41,358
cover of the New York Times magazine and

851
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:43,358
I'm still I'm still kind of amazed that

852
00:39:41,358 --> 00:39:44,880
the New York Times editors put it on in

853
00:39:43,358 --> 00:39:46,639
the magazine not to mention on the cover

854
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:49,480
because it was entirely fictitious there

855
00:39:46,639 --> 00:39:52,078
was no campaign there was no broccoli

856
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:54,800
grower that was buying this advertising

857
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:59,318
for their product but we did it and this

858
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:59,318
is one of the ad Strate

859
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:06,200
and boy did I hear it from the kale

860
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:08,280
people right and I'm still hearing it

861
00:40:06,199 --> 00:40:10,639
from the kale

862
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:13,480
people but they were having fun and that

863
00:40:10,639 --> 00:40:15,598
was that was the first lesson that they

864
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:16,800
learn themselves and they relate to me

865
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:18,599
which is the last thing in the world

866
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:20,000
we're going to do is preach about

867
00:40:18,599 --> 00:40:22,079
broccoli because the government has been

868
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:24,440
preaching about broccoli to us for years

869
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:26,359
and years and sales haven't increased

870
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:28,119
we're going to have fun and we're going

871
00:40:26,358 --> 00:40:32,639
to recreate

872
00:40:28,119 --> 00:40:35,440
broccoli image to Consumers um but then

873
00:40:32,639 --> 00:40:39,078
something really interesting

874
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:41,838
happened some students at another

875
00:40:39,079 --> 00:40:44,680
College I won't mention but it happens

876
00:40:41,838 --> 00:40:47,960
to be in New Haven one of the one of the

877
00:40:44,679 --> 00:40:50,598
biggest food deserts in the country

878
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:52,400
right a university surrounded by fairly

879
00:40:50,599 --> 00:40:56,000
poor people without a lot of shopping

880
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:58,400
options decided to take the campaign

881
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:00,519
advertising that Victors and spoils did

882
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:03,358
and create real Billboards and real

883
00:41:00,519 --> 00:41:07,358
signs and they managed to double

884
00:41:03,358 --> 00:41:12,880
broccoli sales in New Haven with their

885
00:41:07,358 --> 00:41:17,279
real Hands-On strategy um one of the the

886
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:21,519
rather largest broccoli grower on the

887
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:24,200
East Coast adopted the alpha vegetable

888
00:41:21,519 --> 00:41:26,159
strategy that Victors and spoils came up

889
00:41:24,199 --> 00:41:29,358
with having seen that broccoli was a bit

890
00:41:26,159 --> 00:41:32,358
of a wall flow are timid they decided to

891
00:41:29,358 --> 00:41:36,159
make it big and bold and dramatic and

892
00:41:32,358 --> 00:41:38,199
indeed thanks to Thomas this is one of

893
00:41:36,159 --> 00:41:40,440
their broccoli

894
00:41:38,199 --> 00:41:42,199
boxes and you can go to their website

895
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:44,960
and see a whole bunch of other sort of

896
00:41:42,199 --> 00:41:49,039
advertising strategy they're using and

897
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:52,039
then um the Obama let's move campaign

898
00:41:49,039 --> 00:41:55,480
people got the the um protest

899
00:41:52,039 --> 00:41:58,440
Association folks um interested in doing

900
00:41:55,480 --> 00:42:01,838
something even more dramatic powerful

901
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:04,880
which was engaging some of our

902
00:42:01,838 --> 00:42:07,639
celebrities who endorse the junkiest

903
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:11,400
food products out there to turn around

904
00:42:07,639 --> 00:42:15,679
and lend their good name and good faces

905
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:20,880
um to things like broccoli and um and in

906
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:26,399
this case um in this case Citrus um and

907
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:28,318
um um and it's taking off uh the produce

908
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:30,838
Association is actually now doing two

909
00:42:28,318 --> 00:42:33,960
experimental programs in two cities

910
00:42:30,838 --> 00:42:36,199
where they're trying to measure um the

911
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:39,079
ability of this kind of advertising

912
00:42:36,199 --> 00:42:42,078
campaign to um to increase sales and I

913
00:42:39,079 --> 00:42:44,000
think that I'm hoping that if that data

914
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:46,839
is as strong it as is they'll be able to

915
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:50,880
convince the produce Growers themselves

916
00:42:46,838 --> 00:42:53,119
to start coughing up money for marketing

917
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:55,480
again look there's no there's no way

918
00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:57,800
that SK that that spinach is ever going

919
00:42:55,480 --> 00:43:00,199
to be able to compete with Skittle

920
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:02,720
for that reward center of our brain but

921
00:43:00,199 --> 00:43:05,919
they don't really have to match it just

922
00:43:02,719 --> 00:43:07,959
get close to it to have some dramatic

923
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:10,480
impact in the grocery store where other

924
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:13,760
things can happen too none other than

925
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:16,280
Walmart I um I Heard the other day in

926
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:18,680
some of its stores in West Virginia were

927
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:22,519
rejiggering the physical layout of

928
00:43:18,679 --> 00:43:24,799
grocery stores to increase the presence

929
00:43:22,519 --> 00:43:28,159
of vegetables and I'll show you a little

930
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:30,519
segment of of this

931
00:43:28,159 --> 00:43:33,639
so what happens when three West Virginia

932
00:43:30,519 --> 00:43:36,639
Walmarts decide to take the cyan chicks

933
00:43:33,639 --> 00:43:38,639
out of one checkout out for store and

934
00:43:36,639 --> 00:43:40,118
replace them with fruit and other

935
00:43:38,639 --> 00:43:41,799
healthy items that's all I'm going to

936
00:43:40,119 --> 00:43:43,720
show you because the answer is they

937
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:45,359
increase sales and it was working

938
00:43:43,719 --> 00:43:47,439
because a checkout counter is actually

939
00:43:45,358 --> 00:43:49,679
one of the most dangerous places in The

940
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:51,599
Shopper if you're thinking about health

941
00:43:49,679 --> 00:43:53,358
because the stores know that that's when

942
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:55,559
your guard is down and you're much more

943
00:43:53,358 --> 00:43:58,400
apt to impulse buy and so that's why the

944
00:43:55,559 --> 00:44:00,400
soda company started planting um

945
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:01,920
refrigerators there with sodas that you

946
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:05,800
could buy at the last

947
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:09,039
moment um which brings me to this

948
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:13,079
incredible sort of moment we're in now

949
00:44:09,039 --> 00:44:17,558
where we have this huge number of

950
00:44:13,079 --> 00:44:21,240
startup companies run in some cases by

951
00:44:17,559 --> 00:44:24,880
people from Silicon Valley other cases

952
00:44:21,239 --> 00:44:28,598
food a people like here at Cornell who

953
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:31,838
are trying to to use that awful word

954
00:44:28,599 --> 00:44:33,760
disrupt or reinvent sort of all segments

955
00:44:31,838 --> 00:44:36,199
of the grocery store and it's it's

956
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:38,920
really sort of fun watching them try to

957
00:44:36,199 --> 00:44:42,439
do their their thing um some of them are

958
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:46,200
coming up with products like this which

959
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:49,240
is soilent the drink right but others

960
00:44:46,199 --> 00:44:53,879
are coming up with um really interesting

961
00:44:49,239 --> 00:44:57,439
things like this sort of reformulating a

962
00:44:53,880 --> 00:45:01,920
ketchup to substitute all the add added

963
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:03,679
sugar with like real vegetables instead

964
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:06,480
and in this case the guys who invented

965
00:45:03,679 --> 00:45:09,239
that are a couple of military veterans

966
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:12,159
from the Iraq War um and the stuff

967
00:45:09,239 --> 00:45:14,239
actually tastes really good um but one

968
00:45:12,159 --> 00:45:16,639
of the things that I'm most excited

969
00:45:14,239 --> 00:45:19,639
about is a number of the people I wrote

970
00:45:16,639 --> 00:45:22,960
about in the book who brought us things

971
00:45:19,639 --> 00:45:25,920
like the Lunchables and cocacola and

972
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:29,000
Rice Krispy treat cereal have now

973
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:30,920
switched s Ides having having some

974
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:33,679
considerable misgiving about their life

975
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:37,240
work and they are now helping some of

976
00:45:33,679 --> 00:45:40,519
the startups scale up by lending some of

977
00:45:37,239 --> 00:45:42,598
their hardcore formulation and marketing

978
00:45:40,519 --> 00:45:46,679
strategy to these new companies so

979
00:45:42,599 --> 00:45:50,240
Jeffrey Dunn of cocacola Fame Right

980
00:45:46,679 --> 00:45:52,838
started putting baby carrots in vending

981
00:45:50,239 --> 00:45:56,118
machines and using advertising like the

982
00:45:52,838 --> 00:45:59,000
broccoli campaign to make baby carrots

983
00:45:56,119 --> 00:46:01,760
fun Ed Martin the guy who invented the

984
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:04,880
Rice Krispies treat cereal for Kelloggs

985
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:08,559
is all excited about these

986
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:11,800
things which are cargo containers you

987
00:46:08,559 --> 00:46:13,319
can plop into any food desert these were

988
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:16,800
actually started to be used by pot

989
00:46:13,318 --> 00:46:19,480
growers but he's got the idea of using

990
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:22,440
them for lettu usce throw little solar

991
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:25,920
panels on the the roof and you have

992
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:29,960
instant year round accessible and

993
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:32,079
hopefully um affordable greens um and

994
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:35,240
then there's um then there's Sarah

995
00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:38,440
Britto from the victors and spoils um

996
00:46:35,239 --> 00:46:39,719
broccoli campaign who you saw um Sarah

997
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:43,838
is

998
00:46:39,719 --> 00:46:47,318
pictured um here I'm backing up sorry um

999
00:46:43,838 --> 00:46:50,119
here is Sarah Sarah uh worked for craft

1000
00:46:47,318 --> 00:46:53,239
and one of her one of her biggest hits

1001
00:46:50,119 --> 00:46:56,680
was figuring out how to increase sales

1002
00:46:53,239 --> 00:46:57,479
of mac and cheese and and as Sarah tells

1003
00:46:56,679 --> 00:47:00,358
us

1004
00:46:57,480 --> 00:47:03,519
she was surveying neighborhoods I think

1005
00:47:00,358 --> 00:47:04,960
it was in Denver and she walked into one

1006
00:47:03,519 --> 00:47:08,599
family's house and they were sitting

1007
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:11,440
around talking and and she said um she

1008
00:47:08,599 --> 00:47:13,280
said to them kind of confiding that hey

1009
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:15,920
we were just at your neighbors and they

1010
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:19,800
were telling us how much they loved

1011
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:21,680
craft mac and cheese and this light bulb

1012
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:24,800
went on and the people she was talking

1013
00:47:21,679 --> 00:47:26,919
to and they said really and that's when

1014
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:30,519
Sarah sort of understood that they could

1015
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:33,599
Market this as this shared secret among

1016
00:47:30,519 --> 00:47:38,239
consumers and so she came up with this

1017
00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:39,880
campaign you know you love it well Sarah

1018
00:47:38,239 --> 00:47:42,239
is now working for a group called The

1019
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:44,200
Chef's Collective bunch of people in the

1020
00:47:42,239 --> 00:47:46,719
restaurant industry cooks and what have

1021
00:47:44,199 --> 00:47:50,439
you who are trying to in reinvent

1022
00:47:46,719 --> 00:47:52,919
restaurant menus um and the foods and in

1023
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:56,159
restaurants to make them just as

1024
00:47:52,920 --> 00:48:00,480
delicious but healthier for people a

1025
00:47:56,159 --> 00:48:02,399
really Tre is part of the um of the of

1026
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:04,318
of our food chain right now in terms of

1027
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:08,160
changing people's habits and then

1028
00:48:04,318 --> 00:48:11,800
there's Bob dra inventor of the uh

1029
00:48:08,159 --> 00:48:15,000
before spoken luncha balls um he has

1030
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:18,280
started advising a young man named Luke

1031
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:21,039
Saunders who is trying to disrupt what

1032
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:23,119
of the more difficult Andor treacherous

1033
00:48:21,039 --> 00:48:27,599
parts of the food system in this country

1034
00:48:23,119 --> 00:48:32,200
the vending machine Luke by the way was

1035
00:48:27,599 --> 00:48:34,960
a was an was a me was a industrial oil

1036
00:48:32,199 --> 00:48:38,558
salesman working in the midwest when he

1037
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:42,280
went into a food factory that was making

1038
00:48:38,559 --> 00:48:45,680
frozen crustless peanut butter and jelly

1039
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:48,079
sandwiches and Luke said what parent

1040
00:48:45,679 --> 00:48:50,039
would serve these to their kids and the

1041
00:48:48,079 --> 00:48:51,720
and the manager said it's not parents

1042
00:48:50,039 --> 00:48:54,400
the schools are buying this because they

1043
00:48:51,719 --> 00:48:56,480
no longer have kitchens to cook real

1044
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:58,559
food and Luke just kind of goes God

1045
00:48:56,480 --> 00:49:02,000
there's got to be like a better way to

1046
00:48:58,559 --> 00:49:06,400
do some of this food stuff Luke came up

1047
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:10,039
with the farmers fridge salad vending

1048
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:13,559
machine which is actually working it's

1049
00:49:10,039 --> 00:49:16,759
fresh salad it's affordable he's got 30

1050
00:49:13,559 --> 00:49:19,839
or 100 of these in the Chicago area now

1051
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:23,359
poor people wealthier people are buying

1052
00:49:19,838 --> 00:49:28,000
them and Bob drain is helping him sort

1053
00:49:23,358 --> 00:49:30,039
of rethink the marketing Strate strategy

1054
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:32,599
um for the farmer fridge and it's a

1055
00:49:30,039 --> 00:49:35,239
little scary because because drain is

1056
00:49:32,599 --> 00:49:37,440
about you know things like captive

1057
00:49:35,239 --> 00:49:39,798
audiences and and he goes to Luke you

1058
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:42,440
know look you're putting these at 711s

1059
00:49:39,798 --> 00:49:43,639
but but people drive to the 7-Eleven and

1060
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:45,400
that means they can drive down the

1061
00:49:43,639 --> 00:49:47,000
street to Burger King you're not you're

1062
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:49,838
you're going to lose a lot of those

1063
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:51,798
people why don't you park these things

1064
00:49:49,838 --> 00:49:55,599
in like a big office building where you

1065
00:49:51,798 --> 00:49:57,880
have a captive audience a targeted

1066
00:49:55,599 --> 00:50:00,000
captive audience and it's the it's this

1067
00:49:57,880 --> 00:50:02,358
hardcore expression that maybe maybe a

1068
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:04,920
little scary for food startup people who

1069
00:50:02,358 --> 00:50:08,358
aren't used to thinking about their

1070
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:10,400
lovely product in in in that fashion um

1071
00:50:08,358 --> 00:50:13,759
this by the way is the original

1072
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:16,480
strategic marketing for for lunchable

1073
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:18,960
that that that made it so focused and so

1074
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:21,000
cunning and Bob is trying to help Luke

1075
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:24,798
come up with a sort of similar marketing

1076
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:28,199
strategy for the for the Lunchables

1077
00:50:24,798 --> 00:50:30,599
um and who knows I mean eventually I

1078
00:50:28,199 --> 00:50:33,838
think that going back to Nestle that if

1079
00:50:30,599 --> 00:50:37,039
you could use the tried and true food

1080
00:50:33,838 --> 00:50:40,440
industry methods of lowering cost

1081
00:50:37,039 --> 00:50:44,480
increasing convenience um and increasing

1082
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:46,280
demand um that you'll not just get more

1083
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:48,000
produce sales in the produce style I

1084
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:51,760
think you'll get the food Giants

1085
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:54,719
themselves more keen on using more

1086
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:56,640
vegetables um Andor fruits in their

1087
00:50:54,719 --> 00:50:57,879
products throughout the grocery store

1088
00:50:56,639 --> 00:51:00,118
store so you don't even have to do the

1089
00:50:57,880 --> 00:51:02,480
Walmart thing and put bananas at the

1090
00:51:00,119 --> 00:51:04,720
checkout counter you can have the

1091
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:06,480
essence of those bananas in food

1092
00:51:04,719 --> 00:51:09,199
products where you don't anymore today

1093
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:11,159
and all the the lovely nutritional value

1094
00:51:09,199 --> 00:51:15,000
of of that

1095
00:51:11,159 --> 00:51:18,000
um of course there's always the food

1096
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:20,798
Giants and they are trying their best

1097
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:24,798
now to reinvent their products too this

1098
00:51:20,798 --> 00:51:27,798
was a recent tasting in um in

1099
00:51:24,798 --> 00:51:29,798
Williamsburg Brooklyn where Kelloggs had

1100
00:51:27,798 --> 00:51:34,679
a stand where they were adding things

1101
00:51:29,798 --> 00:51:37,239
like pork fat to Rice Krispies Cereal

1102
00:51:34,679 --> 00:51:39,759
which was sort of their way of trying to

1103
00:51:37,239 --> 00:51:43,399
reinvent their products and who knows

1104
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:45,960
they may succeed in some ways maybe this

1105
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:48,318
maybe that or maybe they'll just go back

1106
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:50,639
to this sort of tried and true method

1107
00:51:48,318 --> 00:51:53,599
too but I think that with a little bit

1108
00:51:50,639 --> 00:51:56,039
of help from the food Giants and their

1109
00:51:53,599 --> 00:51:58,720
marketing strategies a lot of these

1110
00:51:56,039 --> 00:52:02,159
startups themselves can really start

1111
00:51:58,719 --> 00:52:06,439
scaling up and make a really big

1112
00:52:02,159 --> 00:52:10,279
difference in um our eating habits and

1113
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:13,440
and public health as a result of that

1114
00:52:10,280 --> 00:52:16,599
and lastly I always forget that but uh

1115
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:19,440
this rather but as I work on the next

1116
00:52:16,599 --> 00:52:21,720
book I'm is still out there engaging

1117
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:24,039
with people and tweeting through this

1118
00:52:21,719 --> 00:52:27,239
address so if any of you want to keep in

1119
00:52:24,039 --> 00:52:31,759
touch uh with me on that

1120
00:52:27,239 --> 00:52:37,479
um on on that scale I'd be glad to and

1121
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:37,480
that's all I have thank you so much for

1122
00:52:39,199 --> 00:52:44,118
listen sure if we have time absolutely

1123
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:46,240
yeah but the other beautiful thing about

1124
00:52:44,119 --> 00:52:48,760
about fruits and vegetables is you can

1125
00:52:46,239 --> 00:52:50,838
do some processing you can freeze for

1126
00:52:48,760 --> 00:52:52,160
example I mean one of my favorite things

1127
00:52:50,838 --> 00:52:55,000
to buy this time of year frozen

1128
00:52:52,159 --> 00:52:56,960
blueberries which if frozen correctly

1129
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:59,159
can actually make a lot more ethical

1130
00:52:56,960 --> 00:53:01,639
moral sense Health sense than trying to

1131
00:52:59,159 --> 00:53:03,879
buy fresh blueberries imported from who

1132
00:53:01,639 --> 00:53:07,558
knows where so I think there's actually

1133
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:09,680
a lot of cunning processing that the

1134
00:53:07,559 --> 00:53:12,519
industry could do and look look I mean

1135
00:53:09,679 --> 00:53:14,798
processing is not necessarily an evil

1136
00:53:12,519 --> 00:53:18,318
word word and and and certainly I'm not

1137
00:53:14,798 --> 00:53:19,798
about about being anti-all food

1138
00:53:18,318 --> 00:53:23,039
processing otherwise I wouldn't be

1139
00:53:19,798 --> 00:53:25,039
eating my favorite cheeses for example

1140
00:53:23,039 --> 00:53:27,119
um it's about it's about controlling

1141
00:53:25,039 --> 00:53:31,480
process foods rather than letting

1142
00:53:27,119 --> 00:53:33,358
them control us and I think that that

1143
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:34,599
knowing as the Food Industries know that

1144
00:53:33,358 --> 00:53:35,759
more and more people are caring about

1145
00:53:34,599 --> 00:53:37,240
what they put in their bodies and

1146
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:39,480
they're they're starting to make p

1147
00:53:37,239 --> 00:53:41,279
purchase decisions based on that I I

1148
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:42,599
think they'll understand that they can't

1149
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:45,440
they can't ruin those things and they

1150
00:53:42,599 --> 00:53:48,519
may be able to incorporate them into

1151
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:50,760
into into products you know where people

1152
00:53:48,519 --> 00:53:54,719
need some convenience in their in their

1153
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:56,200
lives yeah the the good news is that I

1154
00:53:54,719 --> 00:53:57,159
think in many other countries including

1155
00:53:56,199 --> 00:53:59,399
France

1156
00:53:57,159 --> 00:54:01,558
there's sort of more mindfulness about

1157
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:03,160
food and and I and I know that the folks

1158
00:54:01,559 --> 00:54:04,760
at the food lab here at Cornell has

1159
00:54:03,159 --> 00:54:06,960
really paid close attention to that

1160
00:54:04,760 --> 00:54:09,400
issue of mindfulness because it does

1161
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:11,519
seem to be does seem like there was this

1162
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:13,838
moment in the 1980s when suddenly

1163
00:54:11,519 --> 00:54:15,559
overnight we became mindless about food

1164
00:54:13,838 --> 00:54:17,759
and and it became socially acceptable to

1165
00:54:15,559 --> 00:54:19,720
eat anything anywhere any time and

1166
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:21,160
that's when you started people see

1167
00:54:19,719 --> 00:54:23,358
people walk down the street and eating

1168
00:54:21,159 --> 00:54:25,279
and drinking and bringing food into

1169
00:54:23,358 --> 00:54:26,960
business meetings and if I open up a bag

1170
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:30,119
of chips right now and had Naki probably

1171
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:31,599
wouldn't be that shocked and that played

1172
00:54:30,119 --> 00:54:34,760
right into the hands of the food

1173
00:54:31,599 --> 00:54:36,200
companies and making us less mindful

1174
00:54:34,760 --> 00:54:38,119
about them and so they started to

1175
00:54:36,199 --> 00:54:40,318
engineer products you could eat with one

1176
00:54:38,119 --> 00:54:42,280
hand and didn't need utensils while you

1177
00:54:40,318 --> 00:54:44,440
were doing something something else and

1178
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:46,839
that led to snacking becoming this

1179
00:54:44,440 --> 00:54:51,079
fourth American meal I mean in France

1180
00:54:46,838 --> 00:54:54,318
still people think we're crazy to I mean

1181
00:54:51,079 --> 00:54:57,280
why would you want to ruin your appetite

1182
00:54:54,318 --> 00:54:59,558
before having a meal where you were

1183
00:54:57,280 --> 00:55:03,319
going to sit down with friends and

1184
00:54:59,559 --> 00:55:06,160
family and linger for a couple of hours

1185
00:55:03,318 --> 00:55:09,000
enjoying kind of the sociability as well

1186
00:55:06,159 --> 00:55:11,118
as the food itself it's changing though

1187
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:13,280
but because American processed foods are

1188
00:55:11,119 --> 00:55:16,160
starting to spread around the world not

1189
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:19,680
just to Saudi Arabia or Brazil where I

1190
00:55:16,159 --> 00:55:22,598
showed Nestle's boat but in Europe as

1191
00:55:19,679 --> 00:55:26,118
well and so you're seeing increasing

1192
00:55:22,599 --> 00:55:29,519
obesity and diabetes and in in in lots

1193
00:55:26,119 --> 00:55:31,838
of the developed world as well um uh

1194
00:55:29,519 --> 00:55:34,038
where the convenience and the Allure of

1195
00:55:31,838 --> 00:55:37,239
processed foods and or kind of the

1196
00:55:34,039 --> 00:55:40,079
craziness of their lives is is is is

1197
00:55:37,239 --> 00:55:43,239
making them more dependent on American

1198
00:55:40,079 --> 00:55:46,200
style process

1199
00:55:43,239 --> 00:55:48,798
food all right um yeah I think

1200
00:55:46,199 --> 00:55:50,960
potentially but but um and you know I

1201
00:55:48,798 --> 00:55:53,480
used to I used to

1202
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:56,280
really I used to really hate the idea of

1203
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:59,639
the soda tax um as being regressive and

1204
00:55:56,280 --> 00:56:02,240
hurting poor people who you know who who

1205
00:55:59,639 --> 00:56:03,960
um you know who who who are paying the

1206
00:56:02,239 --> 00:56:06,519
tax but but I've sort of come around on

1207
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:09,039
that but but it's funny because I I I

1208
00:56:06,519 --> 00:56:12,838
put that question to Jeff Bible the

1209
00:56:09,039 --> 00:56:14,839
former CEO Philip Morris um and in his

1210
00:56:12,838 --> 00:56:16,519
Australian accent which I can't mimic he

1211
00:56:14,838 --> 00:56:19,880
said to me you know Michael look I'm no

1212
00:56:16,519 --> 00:56:22,400
fan of government but but when it comes

1213
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:25,318
to food I mean you have to remember

1214
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:28,440
these food companies are so viciously

1215
00:56:25,318 --> 00:56:32,239
competitive for space on the grocery

1216
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:36,039
shelf and and people are becoming so

1217
00:56:32,239 --> 00:56:38,719
concerned about food these days that I

1218
00:56:36,039 --> 00:56:42,640
think it could actually behoove the food

1219
00:56:38,719 --> 00:56:46,279
companies to to take it upon themselves

1220
00:56:42,639 --> 00:56:49,519
actually to suggest some regulation

1221
00:56:46,280 --> 00:56:52,079
relating to nutrition if only to sort of

1222
00:56:49,519 --> 00:56:55,239
give them cover from Wall Street because

1223
00:56:52,079 --> 00:56:57,640
they're all under tremendous pressure to

1224
00:56:55,239 --> 00:56:59,798
produce profits and that pressure is has

1225
00:56:57,639 --> 00:57:02,879
just increased year after year after

1226
00:56:59,798 --> 00:57:05,239
year and that was sort of Jeff Bible's

1227
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:08,119
sense was it would be in the industry's

1228
00:57:05,239 --> 00:57:09,598
own interest to sort of reach out but I

1229
00:57:08,119 --> 00:57:11,358
don't think they're going to accept it

1230
00:57:09,599 --> 00:57:14,400
coming the other way and I think there's

1231
00:57:11,358 --> 00:57:16,480
just this inherent resistance to to

1232
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:18,240
having government intervention

1233
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:20,719
especially if it doesn't make any sense

1234
00:57:18,239 --> 00:57:23,239
to the the food companies I'd much

1235
00:57:20,719 --> 00:57:26,318
rather see the change come from the food

1236
00:57:23,239 --> 00:57:29,479
companies themselves finding ways to

1237
00:57:26,318 --> 00:57:31,558
continue making money um uh with

1238
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:35,119
healthier products and and I think

1239
00:57:31,559 --> 00:57:35,119
they're starting they're starting to

1240
00:57:36,358 --> 00:57:42,759
try with that let's go try some food

1241
00:57:40,358 --> 00:57:42,759
great thank

1242
00:57:44,239 --> 00:57:49,759
