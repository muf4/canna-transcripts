1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:04,620
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,589 --> 00:00:04,619
University

3
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:15,179
and thank you again for coming so today

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:19,199
I'll be presenting about applications of

5
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:23,820
multi freight and multi canal models for

6
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:25,528
genomic selection in cassava and I'm

7
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:30,169
really grateful to a lot of people who

8
00:00:25,528 --> 00:00:30,169
have like helped me to reach this stage

9
00:00:35,659 --> 00:00:42,539
okay well I'll skip the outline and tell

10
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:46,289
you a little bit about cassava which is

11
00:00:42,539 --> 00:00:51,149
kind of very exciting to me cassava is

12
00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:53,539
no longer an orphan crop about 263

13
00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:58,350
million metric tons we are produced in

14
00:00:53,539 --> 00:01:01,890
2012 cassava is a starch mission

15
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:05,820
so we have about 90 percent of drivers

16
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:09,329
Kappa hydrates and then some tracy's all

17
00:01:05,819 --> 00:01:14,639
that stuff cassava is an out crosser

18
00:01:09,328 --> 00:01:16,679
producing male and female flower and the

19
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:20,129
interesting thing is even with low

20
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:23,190
imputes and marginal and still giving

21
00:01:20,129 --> 00:01:25,978
some tangible productivity so it's very

22
00:01:23,189 --> 00:01:30,989
interesting this is the most interesting

23
00:01:25,978 --> 00:01:34,349
to me it's 2016

24
00:01:30,989 --> 00:01:36,509
I guess who were in China and we

25
00:01:34,349 --> 00:01:38,819
collected this information that China

26
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:41,400
has bought about a billion US dollars

27
00:01:38,819 --> 00:01:44,849
worth of cassava chips and that's very

28
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:48,000
interesting it's gonna drive market and

29
00:01:44,849 --> 00:01:51,359
I think again the reason is that cassava

30
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:56,010
starch is very very very appealing to

31
00:01:51,359 --> 00:02:01,789
the food industry so with that I make a

32
00:01:56,010 --> 00:02:06,359
jump now to my introduction mixed models

33
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:08,429
so I was introduced to nice models by

34
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:13,110
working with Danny said at dinner he

35
00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:16,229
just walked in and I lent la jolla from

36
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:21,760
beneath to index so II remember ml has

37
00:02:16,229 --> 00:02:25,009
three servers if s so Verizon very

38
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:28,429
single candles over by canal we need one

39
00:02:25,009 --> 00:02:33,049
random effect and and it's based on the

40
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:37,219
EMA gordium the the the second service

41
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:40,459
is the motor canals over which is in

42
00:02:37,219 --> 00:02:43,219
fact heir apparent DS is based on canal

43
00:02:40,459 --> 00:02:47,360
averaging and then another interesting

44
00:02:43,219 --> 00:02:50,180
solver we have is this mod Street solver

45
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:52,480
which is based on Lee Seon agar idiom

46
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:56,540
there was developed by Zhu and Matthews

47
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:59,780
think 2014 so the interesting thing

48
00:02:56,539 --> 00:03:03,099
about Elam Rama is that it is very

49
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:07,699
flexible and you can adapt it to various

50
00:03:03,099 --> 00:03:11,419
things and we have actually adapted this

51
00:03:07,699 --> 00:03:15,829
multi traits over to different kind of

52
00:03:11,419 --> 00:03:17,809
models which I will show today and EMM

53
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:23,510
Renault has in fact been successful in

54
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:26,989
converting literature so the talk is

55
00:03:23,509 --> 00:03:30,879
structured as chapters in my thesis and

56
00:03:26,989 --> 00:03:33,799
the first chapter we looked at

57
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:36,229
accuracies of very little motivated

58
00:03:33,799 --> 00:03:39,439
anomic prediction models in african

59
00:03:36,229 --> 00:03:43,219
cassava so our motivation for these was

60
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:46,189
to understand which models are we to use

61
00:03:43,219 --> 00:03:48,469
for gsm cassava and then the next thing

62
00:03:46,189 --> 00:03:52,699
is to evaluate the breeding values from

63
00:03:48,469 --> 00:03:55,159
these models and see what's going on and

64
00:03:52,699 --> 00:03:59,179
so for these we had data set an

65
00:03:55,159 --> 00:04:03,039
interesting historic data set it was a

66
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:05,239
multi a multi environment trial data

67
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:11,019
he was collected from the so-called

68
00:04:05,239 --> 00:04:15,019
genetic game at IIT a button Nigeria and

69
00:04:11,019 --> 00:04:18,139
over a span of about 16 years from 2000

70
00:04:15,019 --> 00:04:21,829
to 2015 we chose these three locations

71
00:04:18,139 --> 00:04:24,139
would be a Johnny button and in fact

72
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:27,740
these locations are very divergent these

73
00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:31,069
these this is in the rain forest region

74
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:33,889
this is closer to these and this is like

75
00:04:31,069 --> 00:04:34,819
a semi-arid location so they are very

76
00:04:33,889 --> 00:04:37,069
divergent and

77
00:04:34,819 --> 00:04:41,779
represents areas of cassava production

78
00:04:37,069 --> 00:04:45,490
in the area so we used what we call

79
00:04:41,779 --> 00:04:48,619
clonal evolution trials data only and

80
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:56,300
cassava breeding clonal evolution trials

81
00:04:48,620 --> 00:05:00,800
where we impose heavy selection on plasm

82
00:04:56,300 --> 00:05:03,259
so cities mostly augmented design with

83
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:07,400
checks and there are no replications and

84
00:05:03,259 --> 00:05:09,680
this is because of cassava biology we

85
00:05:07,399 --> 00:05:15,639
plant in stakes so you can't get enough

86
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:18,800
text application so we fit we fit

87
00:05:15,639 --> 00:05:21,709
different sets of models in the first

88
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:24,139
scenario we fit models using data from a

89
00:05:21,709 --> 00:05:27,379
single environment but multiple year

90
00:05:24,139 --> 00:05:30,319
data and the second we fit multi

91
00:05:27,379 --> 00:05:38,089
environment trials to capture G by E and

92
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:41,120
we use GBS matrix data to be totally the

93
00:05:38,089 --> 00:05:42,649
genomic relationship matrix from about

94
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:49,939
one hundred and seventy three thousand

95
00:05:42,649 --> 00:05:53,689
markers so this is a little data on the

96
00:05:49,939 --> 00:05:57,500
trades we're dealing with and some

97
00:05:53,689 --> 00:06:00,350
matrix so this is number of records of

98
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:02,569
the data we have at different locations

99
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:05,060
and these are the number of individuals

100
00:06:02,569 --> 00:06:07,430
and we had about three hundred and

101
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:11,149
twenty four individuals across across

102
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:14,840
this location so we our target these

103
00:06:11,149 --> 00:06:17,089
trade six trades Sydney we go number of

104
00:06:14,839 --> 00:06:20,179
routes Hector

105
00:06:17,089 --> 00:06:24,319
fresh yield per hectare drama of course

106
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:27,470
and then lean CNB this is a very

107
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:34,839
critical trade for cassava and then main

108
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:39,370
CGM which is a best best CJ pasture that

109
00:06:34,839 --> 00:06:39,369
it's of this take cassava

110
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:51,910
so in Scenario 1 we fix two interesting

111
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:56,650
models the first model is the basic G

112
00:06:51,910 --> 00:07:00,340
block model we call UT and this is a

113
00:06:56,649 --> 00:07:03,939
single trade model and then the the the

114
00:07:00,339 --> 00:07:06,909
genomica fed are coming from this

115
00:07:03,939 --> 00:07:10,269
distribution given the genomic

116
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:13,030
relationship matrix in the same vein we

117
00:07:10,269 --> 00:07:17,139
fit the multi-thread model which is like

118
00:07:13,029 --> 00:07:21,099
this and in this case we have a matrix

119
00:07:17,139 --> 00:07:23,800
of tricks but then the distribution is

120
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:28,060
different and this is a matrix normal

121
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:30,340
distribution the matrix normal has a row

122
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:32,769
covariance and a column covariance and

123
00:07:30,339 --> 00:07:36,638
this is the covariance the capture of

124
00:07:32,769 --> 00:07:40,089
streets by trade genetic variances and

125
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:42,069
correlations and this this is in fact

126
00:07:40,089 --> 00:07:45,909
the eigen decomposition of this matrix

127
00:07:42,069 --> 00:07:48,430
the genomic referential matrix and it's

128
00:07:45,910 --> 00:07:50,500
a simplification of the algorithm so to

129
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:52,990
simplify the garden sir

130
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:55,629
further we use the chronica product and

131
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:58,900
then transform these to the multivariate

132
00:07:55,629 --> 00:08:02,079
normal distribution and the chronica

133
00:07:58,899 --> 00:08:04,870
helps to get this working but in this

134
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:09,159
case the Y becomes a long vector of

135
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:12,009
stock and effects together okay so a

136
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:15,370
couple of things here is that Y is a

137
00:08:12,009 --> 00:08:19,050
stack of many traits and the X which is

138
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:23,470
fixed effects comment we use location

139
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:26,348
trials trials nested within a nested

140
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:29,080
within locations as fixed and in fact

141
00:08:26,348 --> 00:08:33,759
this the algorithm we use can allow you

142
00:08:29,079 --> 00:08:37,120
to fix different trade different effects

143
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:37,918
sorry in this experience and this is how

144
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:41,979
it works

145
00:08:37,918 --> 00:08:45,399
so we fit this model with the air and

146
00:08:41,979 --> 00:08:47,980
f90 package which is the member of the

147
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:53,769
family of the Lopez 90 program developed

148
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:56,930
by let's meet mr. Alan Koh and we go

149
00:08:53,769 --> 00:09:01,460
forward again in the next scene

150
00:08:56,929 --> 00:09:04,159
to capture G by E in this data and we we

151
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:06,440
fit again two models one is univariate

152
00:09:04,159 --> 00:09:09,019
and another is a motivate in this

153
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:11,930
universe is an interesting model which

154
00:09:09,019 --> 00:09:15,139
is a multicolor model the first color

155
00:09:11,929 --> 00:09:17,689
captures the genomic effect and the

156
00:09:15,139 --> 00:09:20,629
second color captures the clone

157
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:22,580
bilocation effect and in fact what we do

158
00:09:20,629 --> 00:09:25,309
here is that we use the genomic

159
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:28,278
relationship matrix for each location

160
00:09:25,309 --> 00:09:31,419
each individual in each location to

161
00:09:28,278 --> 00:09:33,588
capture the genomic part of the

162
00:09:31,419 --> 00:09:37,399
interaction the clone by location

163
00:09:33,589 --> 00:09:41,660
interaction in the multi environment

164
00:09:37,399 --> 00:09:43,700
model we use the same traits in

165
00:09:41,659 --> 00:09:47,000
different locations it's just like the

166
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:49,640
multi trade model but there are some

167
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:52,129
subtle differences that one of the

168
00:09:49,639 --> 00:09:56,149
differences is coming from this PG

169
00:09:52,129 --> 00:09:58,789
matrix in this matrix now we capture the

170
00:09:56,149 --> 00:10:01,070
genetic variance of same trait at

171
00:09:58,789 --> 00:10:03,319
different locations in the diagonals and

172
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:07,660
in the off diagonals we capture

173
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:10,790
estimates of G by a as the covariances

174
00:10:07,659 --> 00:10:14,990
so the G Vivi's from this ami model

175
00:10:10,789 --> 00:10:20,449
contains both genomic and G by E parts

176
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:24,409
and ve ve is diagonal by diagonal means

177
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:26,240
we just allow for variances variants of

178
00:10:24,409 --> 00:10:28,819
the traits error variance of the trade

179
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:31,009
at different locations and we don't want

180
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:33,770
correlation between these because there

181
00:10:31,009 --> 00:10:36,759
is no no mechanism degeneres correlation

182
00:10:33,769 --> 00:10:40,578
between a trait at different locations

183
00:10:36,759 --> 00:10:44,600
so to match this to compare this um

184
00:10:40,578 --> 00:10:47,120
model with a me we we join these two

185
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:53,200
together the genomic part and the and

186
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:53,200
the interaction part as as DVDs

187
00:10:54,870 --> 00:11:03,570
so to compute the accuracy we fit a

188
00:10:58,019 --> 00:11:05,730
simple model that we call that we call

189
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:09,390
performance genetic performance model

190
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:12,240
and this model just is like the the

191
00:11:09,389 --> 00:11:15,000
first beauty model but in in this case

192
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:17,820
the difference is that it assumes an

193
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,529
identity which means that there is no

194
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:21,780
relationship between the individuals

195
00:11:19,529 --> 00:11:25,199
concerned and we fit this in different

196
00:11:21,779 --> 00:11:28,470
locations and we think that this

197
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:35,009
captures T the estimated total genetic

198
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:39,540
value of the individual so here I show

199
00:11:35,009 --> 00:11:43,769
results and in each block is a different

200
00:11:39,539 --> 00:11:47,009
trait so here is we go AMD is route

201
00:11:43,769 --> 00:11:50,639
number fresh food in each column is a

202
00:11:47,009 --> 00:11:53,220
different location and the first

203
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:56,610
location is a bad on the next is mocha

204
00:11:53,220 --> 00:12:00,090
and the other one is papaya excuse me

205
00:11:56,610 --> 00:12:03,930
so in red is the prediction accuracy for

206
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:07,620
the UT model and in green is the

207
00:12:03,929 --> 00:12:12,109
prediction accuracy for the MT model so

208
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:14,940
we see that in most trails actually that

209
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:20,159
the accuracies of the empty model at

210
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:24,540
higher and and in fact we see this in

211
00:12:20,159 --> 00:12:29,189
almost all the traits and what we make

212
00:12:24,539 --> 00:12:32,939
up these I show you a table of one

213
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:38,130
location and this location is a button

214
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:41,160
showing the heritability Xin diagonal of

215
00:12:38,129 --> 00:12:43,460
these traits and in the off-diagonal are

216
00:12:41,159 --> 00:12:46,949
the genetic correlations for this trait

217
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:50,190
so why do we see these accuracies there

218
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:53,340
we see here that these traits low

219
00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:55,770
heritability traits we have a bunch of

220
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:57,600
slow heritability traits and then we

221
00:12:55,769 --> 00:13:00,569
have this high heritability and maybe

222
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:03,810
this medium ones and in fact when you

223
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:06,780
gently analyze trace of low heritability

224
00:13:03,809 --> 00:13:08,599
with high health abilities and you have

225
00:13:06,779 --> 00:13:11,240
a substantial

226
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:12,920
correlation going on here we expect that

227
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:21,169
the multi-thread accuracies will be

228
00:13:12,919 --> 00:13:25,939
better okay so we ship gets to the

229
00:13:21,169 --> 00:13:30,049
second scenario which is the UD and AME

230
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:32,899
models and just like before we have we

231
00:13:30,049 --> 00:13:36,828
have blocks straights and then columns

232
00:13:32,899 --> 00:13:40,730
and in red is the UE and in green again

233
00:13:36,828 --> 00:13:44,179
is the MA model but in this case we see

234
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:47,360
that most of them are neck to neck in

235
00:13:44,179 --> 00:13:54,939
fact and just in slides places you have

236
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:54,940
the AME a little ahead of it higher so

237
00:13:56,289 --> 00:14:05,198
we get some interesting thing in the

238
00:14:00,159 --> 00:14:08,889
genomic matrix of in the G matrix of the

239
00:14:05,198 --> 00:14:12,620
accorded VD here of the ami model and

240
00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:15,528
this is somewhat kind of a description

241
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:20,240
of what this is and if you think about

242
00:14:15,528 --> 00:14:23,149
for example we go here here in via

243
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:28,000
jmopod this means that if we select some

244
00:14:23,149 --> 00:14:32,419
lines here in Gubicza we expect about

245
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:35,929
39% correlated response to selection in

246
00:14:32,419 --> 00:14:39,349
the next environment and and we see this

247
00:14:35,929 --> 00:14:42,919
in all the all the trades and in fact

248
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:46,159
this gives information on a few of how

249
00:14:42,919 --> 00:14:48,318
to see G by E and then something

250
00:14:46,159 --> 00:14:50,360
interesting again is that you can if you

251
00:14:48,318 --> 00:14:57,799
have several environments you can begin

252
00:14:50,360 --> 00:15:01,579
to cross studies into TPS okay and this

253
00:14:57,799 --> 00:15:05,838
is a table that shows various trends

254
00:15:01,578 --> 00:15:09,859
explained by by by the UE model this is

255
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:12,920
the clone by location variance is

256
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:15,438
explained and this is for clone and I

257
00:15:12,919 --> 00:15:20,629
just wanted to point out here that these

258
00:15:15,438 --> 00:15:22,159
new traits have so much G by E variance

259
00:15:20,629 --> 00:15:25,278
is here compared to order

260
00:15:22,159 --> 00:15:28,189
and we know that these traits are so

261
00:15:25,278 --> 00:15:32,778
much affected by the environment and the

262
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:35,779
same thing goes for these we see here we

263
00:15:32,778 --> 00:15:43,429
have lower correlated response to

264
00:15:35,778 --> 00:15:45,889
selections so in summary what did we get

265
00:15:43,429 --> 00:15:48,528
from these we get that the empty model

266
00:15:45,889 --> 00:15:52,940
of us more accurate reading values for a

267
00:15:48,528 --> 00:15:55,759
single location data and we we see that

268
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:58,069
this comes from significant significant

269
00:15:55,759 --> 00:16:01,459
correlations and joint analysis with

270
00:15:58,068 --> 00:16:03,229
flow and high heritability traits and we

271
00:16:01,458 --> 00:16:07,489
know that this low rate ability traits

272
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:10,339
benefit more from this analysis and then

273
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:13,509
we also see that the MD model and the ue

274
00:16:10,339 --> 00:16:16,519
are not significantly different actually

275
00:16:13,509 --> 00:16:20,180
but we recommend the multivariate

276
00:16:16,519 --> 00:16:22,310
environment for this because we see we

277
00:16:20,179 --> 00:16:25,388
get a lot of information from from

278
00:16:22,309 --> 00:16:28,000
betrayal of both models sorry so

279
00:16:25,389 --> 00:16:31,818
something interesting again coming from

280
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:34,429
the genetic correlations that I showed

281
00:16:31,818 --> 00:16:37,039
you is that there is good prospect for

282
00:16:34,429 --> 00:16:39,409
concurrent improvement of these traits

283
00:16:37,039 --> 00:16:42,860
in cassava and in fact these are the

284
00:16:39,409 --> 00:16:45,139
most well I would say these are

285
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:48,438
production traits and kisara religion

286
00:16:45,139 --> 00:16:51,438
important traits we also see something

287
00:16:48,438 --> 00:16:53,629
interesting is that CMD is negatively

288
00:16:51,438 --> 00:16:59,870
correlated with other traits which is

289
00:16:53,629 --> 00:17:01,250
the direction we want them to to be so

290
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:05,808
in the next chapter I'll move to

291
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:08,179
comparing selection gains from from

292
00:17:05,808 --> 00:17:11,869
multi trait indices from these models

293
00:17:08,179 --> 00:17:14,390
and it's an it's kind of an effort to

294
00:17:11,869 --> 00:17:18,349
evaluate more the breeding values that

295
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:20,270
we got from these models so in

296
00:17:18,349 --> 00:17:23,538
literature we see that a lot of models

297
00:17:20,269 --> 00:17:27,038
are usually evaluated by prediction

298
00:17:23,538 --> 00:17:31,190
accuracies there's a few places where

299
00:17:27,038 --> 00:17:32,960
the evaluation is selection gains but in

300
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:34,820
fact this is because it's not an easy

301
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:36,049
thing to actually do that they are

302
00:17:34,819 --> 00:17:39,019
predicted

303
00:17:36,049 --> 00:17:41,539
so we actually want to know how these

304
00:17:39,019 --> 00:17:46,099
models perform based on predicted games

305
00:17:41,539 --> 00:17:49,309
and one of the problems is having to

306
00:17:46,099 --> 00:17:52,069
make these models comparable it's not an

307
00:17:49,309 --> 00:17:54,409
easy thing to make even if you have

308
00:17:52,069 --> 00:17:56,899
independent data you should have a

309
00:17:54,410 --> 00:17:59,900
comparable reference framework and you

310
00:17:56,900 --> 00:18:01,730
think about which model do I use to make

311
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:06,140
the framework is it a multi trato a

312
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:08,569
single trait anyway we use multi trade

313
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:11,210
selection indices in this case to

314
00:18:08,569 --> 00:18:16,369
achieve this goal and we compared also

315
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:19,340
like before the UTM 3ue and emmy models

316
00:18:16,369 --> 00:18:22,219
but we added two other models to these

317
00:18:19,339 --> 00:18:27,139
which explained in the next slide and

318
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:32,089
these models if you recall the the Yui

319
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:35,570
model with two canals we we have the

320
00:18:32,089 --> 00:18:37,970
genomic part and the GT part so the UTA

321
00:18:35,569 --> 00:18:41,480
is just capturing the genomic parts and

322
00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:46,100
living out to you if the G pad and this

323
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:49,160
is just an average of the entire bar and

324
00:18:46,099 --> 00:18:53,449
then we fit another model which is m TM

325
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:57,680
he which is like a mansion but m e and

326
00:18:53,450 --> 00:19:00,110
entity models this this we think is an

327
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:02,529
interesting model the two reviewers

328
00:19:00,109 --> 00:19:06,049
pointed out there why don't you do this

329
00:19:02,529 --> 00:19:08,420
it wasn't an easy things to do it wasn't

330
00:19:06,049 --> 00:19:10,759
an easy thing to do though but but but

331
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:13,580
we fit it's just like the multi-thread

332
00:19:10,759 --> 00:19:16,039
model but in this case we have 18 traits

333
00:19:13,579 --> 00:19:18,409
we organized this trait as straight one

334
00:19:16,039 --> 00:19:21,700
in environment one trait to in

335
00:19:18,410 --> 00:19:26,360
environment one and in that direction so

336
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:31,130
we had altogether 6 by 3 which is 18 but

337
00:19:26,359 --> 00:19:35,419
then in the arrow arrow part we just use

338
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:38,060
kind of the the ve de from from the ami

339
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:40,789
model which is from the sorry from the

340
00:19:38,059 --> 00:19:43,250
empty model which allows traits to be

341
00:19:40,789 --> 00:19:46,269
only correlated in the specific

342
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:46,269
environment where there

343
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:51,880
and this model is complex to feed it was

344
00:19:49,778 --> 00:19:55,079
fitting in the Gibbs sampling algorithm

345
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:55,080
oh definitely

346
00:19:55,169 --> 00:20:01,389
so how did we estimate gains so first of

347
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:04,929
all we standardized or the trade so that

348
00:20:01,388 --> 00:20:07,119
everybody has the same stat and we used

349
00:20:04,929 --> 00:20:09,460
the same economic weights

350
00:20:07,119 --> 00:20:13,298
these are the weights and these weights

351
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:16,450
represent 20% increase in vigo that 5%

352
00:20:13,298 --> 00:20:19,148
increase in good number for 5% in Brian

353
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:22,419
mother that five percent decrease in CMD

354
00:20:19,148 --> 00:20:25,629
min CMD what five percent increase in

355
00:20:22,419 --> 00:20:30,100
yield fresh food and 10 percent decrease

356
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:33,309
in MC Jia so the index was calculated as

357
00:20:30,099 --> 00:20:35,829
as these so mattress multiplication of

358
00:20:33,308 --> 00:20:38,619
the of the economic weights with the GB

359
00:20:35,829 --> 00:20:43,720
with from each model we selected the top

360
00:20:38,619 --> 00:20:47,018
65 clones from each Motty trait index we

361
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:50,200
estimated gang as the mean of the index

362
00:20:47,019 --> 00:20:53,019
values of this selected and the trait

363
00:20:50,200 --> 00:21:00,278
games we estimated as the mean of the

364
00:20:53,019 --> 00:21:06,370
Gee Bee Gees of selected individuals so

365
00:21:00,278 --> 00:21:11,919
here we have a plot this is Ruby Agha

366
00:21:06,369 --> 00:21:14,798
this is Mohan this is a button and we

367
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:18,250
have this box plot I want you to notice

368
00:21:14,798 --> 00:21:20,859
something that in in and all the

369
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:23,798
locations even here we will have

370
00:21:20,859 --> 00:21:28,119
something like a tie the empty model is

371
00:21:23,798 --> 00:21:31,179
to in better than the UT model but we

372
00:21:28,119 --> 00:21:35,699
see here that the UE model is is doing

373
00:21:31,179 --> 00:21:39,700
much better in in OB aaja and then also

374
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:44,259
slightly better here on average in in

375
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:47,100
mocha and slightly better again on

376
00:21:44,259 --> 00:21:52,720
average in at Abaddonn

377
00:21:47,099 --> 00:21:57,459
well let's jump into the trades and see

378
00:21:52,720 --> 00:22:01,240
what was going on so here is Ruby Agha

379
00:21:57,460 --> 00:22:04,210
and each block is a trade

380
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:04,620
this is Vigo this is route number is dry

381
00:22:04,210 --> 00:22:09,819
matter

382
00:22:04,619 --> 00:22:13,689
this is CND this is fresh yield and this

383
00:22:09,819 --> 00:22:18,819
is a CGM and again they are colored as

384
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:21,700
the same this is you TM t ue a ue m e

385
00:22:18,819 --> 00:22:26,470
and emptier me I would want to point out

386
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:29,259
that this U is no is more like what we

387
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:32,319
do in the next gen is the selection in

388
00:22:29,259 --> 00:22:37,569
this we use in the next-gen program so

389
00:22:32,319 --> 00:22:41,950
we see here in abuja that the UE model

390
00:22:37,569 --> 00:22:45,369
was doing well here and you come to

391
00:22:41,950 --> 00:22:46,720
route number which is a trade today that

392
00:22:45,369 --> 00:22:47,529
has so much influenced by the

393
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:52,089
environment

394
00:22:47,529 --> 00:22:56,529
eme was from him better and in diameter

395
00:22:52,089 --> 00:23:03,099
DME was on average slightly adamian UE

396
00:22:56,529 --> 00:23:06,910
word UE a word in well so we point out

397
00:23:03,099 --> 00:23:09,909
here in CMD whether you eat UE model was

398
00:23:06,910 --> 00:23:12,460
really dominating others we want this to

399
00:23:09,910 --> 00:23:15,640
go down so this going down is a good

400
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:19,720
thing for us so this this is the place

401
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:23,440
that the this model is dominating all

402
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:28,360
these indices and then for fresh here

403
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:33,850
it's doing pretty well and and I think

404
00:23:28,359 --> 00:23:39,250
this models rank almost same so we move

405
00:23:33,849 --> 00:23:43,379
to Magua semi-arid region and we see the

406
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:46,779
mt emei is to a much better here in in

407
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:49,450
which with we go route number DNT a

408
00:23:46,779 --> 00:23:54,009
misty doing better it does very bad job

409
00:23:49,450 --> 00:23:57,100
here for dry mara again the you the UE

410
00:23:54,009 --> 00:24:01,680
and the UE a dominating for CMD here and

411
00:23:57,099 --> 00:24:08,789
in yield again this empty ami model is

412
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:12,970
dominating so we move again - ibadan and

413
00:24:08,789 --> 00:24:14,299
again we see the nga me sorry the ami

414
00:24:12,970 --> 00:24:17,799
model is

415
00:24:14,299 --> 00:24:23,839
kind of dominating here on average and

416
00:24:17,799 --> 00:24:27,919
the in roots number is the MTA me here I

417
00:24:23,839 --> 00:24:32,599
can rank these models want to us almost

418
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:36,140
same and then in again in CMD the youíve

419
00:24:32,599 --> 00:24:40,819
model is dominating in all occasions

420
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:44,300
so in year three MTA me again and LC GM

421
00:24:40,819 --> 00:24:50,509
bu is doing very bad here actually this

422
00:24:44,299 --> 00:24:55,700
should be going down okay so what do we

423
00:24:50,509 --> 00:25:00,740
see from here we see that some models

424
00:24:55,700 --> 00:25:02,779
have hired DVD stand orders and we kind

425
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:05,870
of ask a question since we are using

426
00:25:02,779 --> 00:25:08,509
breeding values can we combine reading

427
00:25:05,869 --> 00:25:12,589
values from different models together

428
00:25:08,509 --> 00:25:16,519
well why not if we interested in making

429
00:25:12,589 --> 00:25:20,269
games so we try these we replace the the

430
00:25:16,519 --> 00:25:24,019
breeding value for C MD from MD with

431
00:25:20,269 --> 00:25:27,109
that from Yui and for dry matter and CMD

432
00:25:24,019 --> 00:25:31,940
at n TM e in mobile we replace with Yui

433
00:25:27,109 --> 00:25:35,750
and ue8 and the same here for n TM e we

434
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:38,630
replace with this and this and then we

435
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:42,349
move on to see what happened in red is

436
00:25:38,630 --> 00:25:45,710
this composite index I call it and you

437
00:25:42,349 --> 00:25:54,199
see it becomes superior to order or the

438
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:56,450
ones so I know that there can be a lot

439
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:58,640
of arguments on why this is not a good

440
00:25:56,450 --> 00:26:00,610
system to evaluate these models there

441
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:05,350
should be a separate independent

442
00:26:00,609 --> 00:26:08,299
reference to do this but this is just

443
00:26:05,349 --> 00:26:10,939
kind of showing a clue of what is going

444
00:26:08,299 --> 00:26:13,490
on in in this and I think an ideal case

445
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:16,610
would be to have independent reference

446
00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:19,599
data to to be able to evaluate these

447
00:26:16,609 --> 00:26:23,179
models or jb's

448
00:26:19,599 --> 00:26:25,490
so from what we learn we see that in

449
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:28,460
accounting for G by E is very important

450
00:26:25,490 --> 00:26:32,670
for making games in

451
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:35,340
because of G by E we probably need to

452
00:26:32,670 --> 00:26:38,820
use several models we we don't know

453
00:26:35,339 --> 00:26:40,949
which can be good and we also in this

454
00:26:38,819 --> 00:26:42,569
case recommend multi trait models

455
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:45,330
because they had a lot of information

456
00:26:42,569 --> 00:26:48,599
month variate model sorry they have a

457
00:26:45,329 --> 00:26:50,549
lot of information and this shows good

458
00:26:48,599 --> 00:26:53,759
prospects actually for Kesava

459
00:26:50,549 --> 00:26:57,990
improvement the composite index males

460
00:26:53,759 --> 00:27:03,750
also be beneficial okay so now I make a

461
00:26:57,990 --> 00:27:07,109
jump to something else us type like type

462
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:11,519
analysis which is mapping traits so we

463
00:27:07,109 --> 00:27:13,199
have an issue in in cassava breeding we

464
00:27:11,519 --> 00:27:16,349
are trying to move towards this

465
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:19,529
beta-carotene cassava which is sponsored

466
00:27:16,349 --> 00:27:23,189
by harvest clause and so on and we saw

467
00:27:19,529 --> 00:27:24,899
we call it so code yellow cassava but we

468
00:27:23,190 --> 00:27:27,509
have a challenge in yellow cassava the

469
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:30,150
challenge is that most of most of the

470
00:27:27,509 --> 00:27:35,460
yellow cassava have lower levels of

471
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:38,340
trimmer actually and and and we need to

472
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:40,230
understand what is going on in this but

473
00:27:38,339 --> 00:27:42,839
we know already that there is a negative

474
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:45,839
correlation between ramada and two by

475
00:27:42,839 --> 00:27:48,740
yellowness in cassava so we set out to

476
00:27:45,839 --> 00:27:54,019
understand the genetic basis of these

477
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:57,660
and here I show a plot this is the white

478
00:27:54,019 --> 00:28:00,660
white cassava path this is the yellow

479
00:27:57,660 --> 00:28:04,529
path and this plot a bullet I brought

480
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:09,450
from is my Robi which was just plot in

481
00:28:04,529 --> 00:28:10,829
dry matter against yellow coloration so

482
00:28:09,450 --> 00:28:19,500
here you can see clearly that these

483
00:28:10,829 --> 00:28:21,960
populations split so we developed the so

484
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:26,009
called regional heritability mapping

485
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:27,900
procedure for cassava and this procedure

486
00:28:26,009 --> 00:28:30,690
is a very interesting application of

487
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:34,880
linear mixed models so what we do we

488
00:28:30,690 --> 00:28:39,390
divide chromosomes in cassava 18 of them

489
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:40,330
into windows sliding windows and these

490
00:28:39,390 --> 00:28:42,940
windows are

491
00:28:40,329 --> 00:28:46,538
hundreds nip each week all these

492
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:48,308
segments so we have this window slide

493
00:28:46,538 --> 00:28:53,408
and true and there is an overlap between

494
00:28:48,308 --> 00:28:56,470
them this overlap is fifty snips I just

495
00:28:53,409 --> 00:28:59,440
sent to 50 snip overlapping with others

496
00:28:56,470 --> 00:29:01,450
and windows so we make a genomic

497
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:03,940
relationship matrix from these segments

498
00:29:01,450 --> 00:29:06,490
we make another genomic relationship

499
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:08,230
matrix from the whole genome snips and

500
00:29:06,490 --> 00:29:11,288
this is the correct for background

501
00:29:08,230 --> 00:29:13,839
effect on population structure we fit

502
00:29:11,288 --> 00:29:17,919
two models one no an alternative model

503
00:29:13,839 --> 00:29:23,648
so here the normal model is just like

504
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:27,519
the G block model using one canal using

505
00:29:23,648 --> 00:29:30,219
all the sleeves but we have but in the

506
00:29:27,519 --> 00:29:33,700
alternative model we fit two canals one

507
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:35,769
canal for the genomic segment we want to

508
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:38,830
capture and the second kind of

509
00:29:35,769 --> 00:29:41,259
correcting for background effect so we

510
00:29:38,829 --> 00:29:45,038
use likelihood ratio test to test for

511
00:29:41,259 --> 00:29:52,658
significance of this canal and we plot

512
00:29:45,038 --> 00:29:56,200
these reproduce as Manhattan plots so

513
00:29:52,659 --> 00:29:58,240
what data do we use we use the so-called

514
00:29:56,200 --> 00:30:02,250
genetic data again genetic game data

515
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:08,769
again but this time only measured from

516
00:30:02,250 --> 00:30:11,980
2013 to 2015 we use a bivariate trait

517
00:30:08,769 --> 00:30:14,528
called pop color which just is sorry a

518
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:17,909
binary trait we just measures whether

519
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:21,159
you a yellow or white or maybe off-white

520
00:30:17,909 --> 00:30:23,730
that's the case maybe so we use this to

521
00:30:21,159 --> 00:30:28,360
separate the population into two parts

522
00:30:23,730 --> 00:30:31,778
we use GPS names numbering about 177

523
00:30:28,359 --> 00:30:36,908
thousand and the number of the whites

524
00:30:31,778 --> 00:30:39,190
were 451 and for yellow we're 262 so

525
00:30:36,909 --> 00:30:40,450
phenotypes of course we are from three

526
00:30:39,190 --> 00:30:44,880
locations again

527
00:30:40,450 --> 00:30:44,880
or we corrected these as fixed effects

528
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:51,788
so

529
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:54,519
we show the LD between segments its

530
00:30:51,788 --> 00:30:57,519
segments in a chromosome and each color

531
00:30:54,519 --> 00:31:01,690
change is a different chromosome so here

532
00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:05,019
we see see the kind of LD we get we have

533
00:31:01,690 --> 00:31:06,610
this low LD giving us confidence then

534
00:31:05,019 --> 00:31:11,740
when we get associations these

535
00:31:06,609 --> 00:31:16,240
associations be real okay here we see

536
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:19,058
the me the the this land or spar lengths

537
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:20,710
of genomic segments in base pairs and we

538
00:31:19,058 --> 00:31:27,119
see that a lot of segments are between

539
00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:27,120
300 plus Cape 200 plus thousand KD yeah

540
00:31:28,679 --> 00:31:36,370
okay so when we plot the results here we

541
00:31:32,769 --> 00:31:39,429
see we see in the first plot is the

542
00:31:36,369 --> 00:31:42,969
white cassava and in the second is the

543
00:31:39,429 --> 00:31:46,330
yellow cassava so we see here we pick up

544
00:31:42,970 --> 00:31:54,788
signals in chromosome one if you go from

545
00:31:46,329 --> 00:31:59,199
four from far from five from 10 from 17

546
00:31:54,788 --> 00:32:04,599
and from 18 and then in in yellow we

547
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:07,029
pick up only for chromosome 1 and so

548
00:32:04,599 --> 00:32:13,509
bear in mind here also that we have like

549
00:32:07,029 --> 00:32:17,079
very little sample size so what next we

550
00:32:13,509 --> 00:32:18,940
do we try to see whether we can extract

551
00:32:17,079 --> 00:32:22,269
some information from the genome by

552
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:26,890
doing candidate gene analysis and we

553
00:32:22,269 --> 00:32:31,658
extracted information on 500 KB flanking

554
00:32:26,890 --> 00:32:35,080
each side of the heat we had will show

555
00:32:31,659 --> 00:32:39,610
later the choice of this is 500 KB and

556
00:32:35,079 --> 00:32:43,418
based on literature review we were

557
00:32:39,609 --> 00:32:46,079
seeing two families coming up all the

558
00:32:43,419 --> 00:32:49,299
time and this this is

559
00:32:46,079 --> 00:32:52,808
glycosyltransferase ease and beginning

560
00:32:49,298 --> 00:32:55,690
deeper into these is like carbohydrate

561
00:32:52,808 --> 00:32:57,490
enzymes of which starts in DC sucrose

562
00:32:55,690 --> 00:32:58,419
synthesis and so on and so forth in

563
00:32:57,490 --> 00:33:02,019
there

564
00:32:58,419 --> 00:33:04,809
and we see another family of serine

565
00:33:02,019 --> 00:33:09,940
threonine kinases and and these these

566
00:33:04,808 --> 00:33:12,398
family regulatory protein kinases we

567
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:15,850
also see in vertices but neutral and

568
00:33:12,398 --> 00:33:21,398
acid and some other plants literally

569
00:33:15,849 --> 00:33:23,439
regions so we also looked on literature

570
00:33:21,398 --> 00:33:25,388
and we saw that this air entraining

571
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:29,308
kindnesses already have transgenic

572
00:33:25,388 --> 00:33:32,019
studies which i am getting in starch so

573
00:33:29,308 --> 00:33:37,928
before I go on I want to point out that

574
00:33:32,019 --> 00:33:41,319
that our goal was not really to say that

575
00:33:37,929 --> 00:33:43,690
this gene is what is causing this but we

576
00:33:41,319 --> 00:33:46,028
kind of think that these genes may be

577
00:33:43,690 --> 00:33:51,700
tagging regions which are very

578
00:33:46,028 --> 00:33:54,989
interesting for try memory in cassava ok

579
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:59,919
so how did how do we validate these then

580
00:33:54,989 --> 00:34:03,038
we performed a validation we performed a

581
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:05,649
validation for these are in training

582
00:34:03,038 --> 00:34:07,720
kindnesses we went to the genome and we

583
00:34:05,648 --> 00:34:12,190
grabbed everything called serine 20

584
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:16,510
kinase or look like it and we extracted

585
00:34:12,190 --> 00:34:20,409
about twelve twelve hundred genes we

586
00:34:16,510 --> 00:34:24,040
encode it to about 7,000 slips and we

587
00:34:20,409 --> 00:34:26,679
used an independent population which was

588
00:34:24,039 --> 00:34:29,199
the progeny of the genetic game hundred

589
00:34:26,679 --> 00:34:34,690
genetic and parents to validate these

590
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:38,259
change excuse me we also took randomly

591
00:34:34,690 --> 00:34:43,898
genes from from from the genome about 7

592
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:48,899
7 2004 about 7,000 snip as control for

593
00:34:43,898 --> 00:34:52,838
this now for these for this we we fix

594
00:34:48,898 --> 00:34:55,690
this to canal model again in the fest

595
00:34:52,838 --> 00:34:58,088
canal is this target which is disorient

596
00:34:55,690 --> 00:35:00,519
run in kinases and in the second is

597
00:34:58,088 --> 00:35:03,670
every retain every resonate in the

598
00:35:00,519 --> 00:35:06,659
genome not ticks and we get prediction

599
00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:06,659
equations for this

600
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:18,039
okay so we do this as well for all that

601
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:20,440
other we have we had this this site on

602
00:35:18,039 --> 00:35:23,409
paper which reported cassava genes

603
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:27,670
involved in stock biosynthesis so we

604
00:35:23,409 --> 00:35:30,359
took those genes excuse me an uncaught

605
00:35:27,670 --> 00:35:34,059
them to snips record em cassava stagings

606
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:37,210
we also extracted all things called

607
00:35:34,059 --> 00:35:41,409
genes in the rh in the significance

608
00:35:37,210 --> 00:35:44,699
regions we had and this gave rise to

609
00:35:41,409 --> 00:35:48,219
about 2300 snips record in region genes

610
00:35:44,699 --> 00:35:51,369
now based on literature we had these 53

611
00:35:48,219 --> 00:35:57,369
lists of genes that we saw that we could

612
00:35:51,369 --> 00:35:59,920
be implicated in starch and we also got

613
00:35:57,369 --> 00:36:02,170
these and anchored them to sleeps about

614
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:05,349
400 snips

615
00:36:02,170 --> 00:36:07,900
we got another 53 randomly just a

616
00:36:05,349 --> 00:36:11,170
control for these and then we went into

617
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:13,690
this region and said oh well let's get

618
00:36:11,170 --> 00:36:16,300
those those genes that I in this region

619
00:36:13,690 --> 00:36:18,670
that are not reported in literature just

620
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:21,190
to check what is going on and we also

621
00:36:18,670 --> 00:36:25,450
anchored them to about 300 something

622
00:36:21,190 --> 00:36:28,750
plus tips so we used these as well in

623
00:36:25,449 --> 00:36:34,059
the same methodology we use for the SNR

624
00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:40,809
case so here we show the prediction

625
00:36:34,059 --> 00:36:45,009
accuracies for the snacks for 7,000 plus

626
00:36:40,809 --> 00:36:47,199
genes it was up about 50% of the

627
00:36:45,010 --> 00:36:50,620
prediction accuracy we get from the

628
00:36:47,199 --> 00:36:53,730
entire snips in the genome so orders

629
00:36:50,619 --> 00:36:57,639
were about 20 something plus percent and

630
00:36:53,730 --> 00:37:01,869
and the random part for for the snacks

631
00:36:57,639 --> 00:37:06,639
was about half of what the snacks heart

632
00:37:01,869 --> 00:37:08,920
so interestingly here when when when I

633
00:37:06,639 --> 00:37:11,679
do the anchoring of these names I find

634
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:14,409
out that all the time the same names

635
00:37:11,679 --> 00:37:16,049
come up again and again which means that

636
00:37:14,409 --> 00:37:19,049
we are really talking something

637
00:37:16,050 --> 00:37:19,050
individuals

638
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:26,620
another thing we did is that we we kind

639
00:37:22,869 --> 00:37:29,170
of since this insight on has already

640
00:37:26,619 --> 00:37:31,989
published this James we wanted to see

641
00:37:29,170 --> 00:37:34,900
which is to with which in our region

642
00:37:31,989 --> 00:37:39,909
that intersecting with these ones that's

643
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:42,190
I don't pick up and we so for genes two

644
00:37:39,909 --> 00:37:44,879
of them one is an acid in vertex when

645
00:37:42,190 --> 00:37:48,119
it's a neutral invitation think so and

646
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:50,980
there's this forceful glucose isomerase

647
00:37:48,119 --> 00:37:52,750
and an interesting one the fructose

648
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:56,710
bisphosphate

649
00:37:52,750 --> 00:37:59,679
aldolase so a quick search on these

650
00:37:56,710 --> 00:38:04,840
shows that Monsanto has a patent pending

651
00:37:59,679 --> 00:38:07,449
on this so again want to point out that

652
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:09,730
we are not we are not searching for

653
00:38:07,449 --> 00:38:12,219
functionality of these genes but we are

654
00:38:09,730 --> 00:38:16,630
tagging regions in the genome that may

655
00:38:12,219 --> 00:38:19,750
be implicated in Andromeda so this is

656
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:23,619
just a plot showing all these genes we

657
00:38:19,750 --> 00:38:27,909
had and the regions where we kind of saw

658
00:38:23,619 --> 00:38:32,460
what was going on so I I don't see very

659
00:38:27,909 --> 00:38:37,119
much okay and this is in chromosome one

660
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:41,619
where we had top hits and the proximity

661
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:47,799
of different genes that we saw in we

662
00:38:41,619 --> 00:38:51,159
selected as candidates so how do we

663
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:52,900
validate the the rhm procedure itself we

664
00:38:51,159 --> 00:38:57,069
use the so called had a causal snip

665
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:59,950
methodology so we move into the genome

666
00:38:57,070 --> 00:39:04,390
we select five adjacent segments by

667
00:38:59,949 --> 00:39:07,089
random and on the third segment we

668
00:39:04,389 --> 00:39:09,179
choose a snip by random and inflate the

669
00:39:07,090 --> 00:39:13,360
variants of the trade fall to about 10%

670
00:39:09,179 --> 00:39:16,539
by adding effect and we make G matrices

671
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:18,340
for each each of the segments but when

672
00:39:16,539 --> 00:39:20,559
we come to the third segment we remove

673
00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:24,180
that sleep that we used for inflating

674
00:39:20,559 --> 00:39:27,610
the the variants phenotypic variants

675
00:39:24,179 --> 00:39:30,059
with only several times to see what was

676
00:39:27,610 --> 00:39:30,059
going on

677
00:39:30,179 --> 00:39:38,608
so this gave a clue on the span of our

678
00:39:36,059 --> 00:39:41,190
candidate gene analysis because we could

679
00:39:38,608 --> 00:39:43,318
pick up genes about two segments we

680
00:39:41,190 --> 00:39:47,159
could pick up effects about two segments

681
00:39:43,318 --> 00:39:51,058
away from from the from the place where

682
00:39:47,159 --> 00:39:53,879
we added this effect so we saw that the

683
00:39:51,059 --> 00:39:56,819
the HM was a good procedure for

684
00:39:53,880 --> 00:40:01,470
polygenic traits and in this analysis we

685
00:39:56,818 --> 00:40:03,630
picked out that 102 times out of two two

686
00:40:01,469 --> 00:40:08,548
and six we pick the effect that we added

687
00:40:03,630 --> 00:40:12,059
and this was about 47% power of

688
00:40:08,548 --> 00:40:13,949
dictation from Association and and we

689
00:40:12,059 --> 00:40:19,970
think that would increase sample size

690
00:40:13,949 --> 00:40:22,379
will probably benefit more so in summary

691
00:40:19,969 --> 00:40:26,669
the other term is informative for

692
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:29,880
mapping complex traits genomic segments

693
00:40:26,670 --> 00:40:33,210
may be employed in breeding there needs

694
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:35,099
to be some research to do this and we we

695
00:40:33,210 --> 00:40:36,838
see that there is good prospect for

696
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:40,528
improvement of crime and I especially

697
00:40:36,838 --> 00:40:44,849
quite casaba and then gerrymander as

698
00:40:40,528 --> 00:40:46,349
well is a polygenic traits okay so in

699
00:40:44,849 --> 00:40:48,750
case you have nothing yellow cassava

700
00:40:46,349 --> 00:40:53,579
this is how it looks and this is white

701
00:40:48,750 --> 00:40:57,900
cassava okay so I move on to the to the

702
00:40:53,579 --> 00:40:59,430
next chapter which is moving away moving

703
00:40:57,900 --> 00:41:03,088
on from the region of heritability

704
00:40:59,429 --> 00:41:05,788
mapping so one trait I'm trying to map

705
00:41:03,088 --> 00:41:08,099
two traits at a time and in this case we

706
00:41:05,789 --> 00:41:12,028
want to see how to trace our co

707
00:41:08,099 --> 00:41:16,260
inherited together and yeah we use dry

708
00:41:12,028 --> 00:41:18,989
matter again the yellowness which is

709
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:22,559
wood color and then we also use fresh

710
00:41:18,989 --> 00:41:26,969
food in some trials that they call high

711
00:41:22,559 --> 00:41:30,359
stockpiles so our motivation is to see

712
00:41:26,969 --> 00:41:33,838
how dry matter and this yellowness are

713
00:41:30,358 --> 00:41:35,940
inherited together and again to see

714
00:41:33,838 --> 00:41:39,889
whether we have like prospects of

715
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:39,889
developing yellow cassava

716
00:41:40,150 --> 00:41:48,590
so how does this go the other CHM

717
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:51,910
procedure starts by so by fitting I

718
00:41:48,590 --> 00:41:55,010
would point out here that the ideal

719
00:41:51,909 --> 00:41:57,379
procedure should have been exactly what

720
00:41:55,010 --> 00:42:00,530
we did for the regenerate ability but in

721
00:41:57,380 --> 00:42:04,010
my various model but we tried to do that

722
00:42:00,530 --> 00:42:06,920
without success because I cream probably

723
00:42:04,010 --> 00:42:08,810
we have less so much less today we could

724
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:12,200
not estimate it so big models were not

725
00:42:08,809 --> 00:42:14,000
converging so what we did was to look

726
00:42:12,199 --> 00:42:17,210
for another procedure to do this and

727
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:21,530
this is the procedure so we fitted by a

728
00:42:17,210 --> 00:42:25,280
very developed model where we use the

729
00:42:21,530 --> 00:42:28,190
empty model as we showed before we use

730
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:31,100
them principal components in in the

731
00:42:28,190 --> 00:42:33,679
fixed effect part and before we did this

732
00:42:31,099 --> 00:42:39,199
actually we brought out these 10 pieces

733
00:42:33,679 --> 00:42:42,879
and we regress them to to dry Mara for a

734
00:42:39,199 --> 00:42:46,669
start and for white we didn't see much

735
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:49,550
value for for the pieces they were not

736
00:42:46,670 --> 00:42:51,289
significant but for yellow we saw that

737
00:42:49,550 --> 00:42:56,090
these 10 pieces were explaining about

738
00:42:51,289 --> 00:43:00,858
23% of variation going on so was it was

739
00:42:56,090 --> 00:43:03,980
essential to toward that so

740
00:43:00,858 --> 00:43:07,309
after fitting this bivariate model we

741
00:43:03,980 --> 00:43:09,559
move forward immediately to calculate

742
00:43:07,309 --> 00:43:12,230
slip effects from the model and and this

743
00:43:09,559 --> 00:43:16,460
this is done by very much by animal

744
00:43:12,230 --> 00:43:19,250
breeders so-called slip lock and just

745
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:22,070
back solve using the estimates that we

746
00:43:19,250 --> 00:43:26,119
got for the billion values the genomic

747
00:43:22,070 --> 00:43:30,490
relationship matrix inverse the Mikami

748
00:43:26,119 --> 00:43:32,660
trees and this mattress may be used to

749
00:43:30,489 --> 00:43:35,500
probably with snips if you are

750
00:43:32,659 --> 00:43:35,500
interested in that

751
00:43:38,159 --> 00:43:45,268
so after solving for sleepy felts we

752
00:43:42,389 --> 00:43:48,679
divided the genome into on each

753
00:43:45,268 --> 00:43:53,129
chromosome into three fairly poor parts

754
00:43:48,679 --> 00:43:56,818
the mean of each segment was about it in

755
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:59,548
megabase approximately so what we did

756
00:43:56,818 --> 00:44:04,308
was we collected so-called genomic

757
00:43:59,548 --> 00:44:07,798
segments values from these excuse me and

758
00:44:04,309 --> 00:44:12,089
genomic segments values where where the

759
00:44:07,798 --> 00:44:16,679
Mikami trees for this segment were in x

760
00:44:12,088 --> 00:44:18,210
the snip effects in this segment way so

761
00:44:16,679 --> 00:44:21,179
this genomic segment values were

762
00:44:18,210 --> 00:44:25,579
calculated for both traits and and then

763
00:44:21,179 --> 00:44:28,440
to find to find to get a correlation for

764
00:44:25,579 --> 00:44:30,630
genomic segments correlation we just

765
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:33,690
correlated this genomic segment for the

766
00:44:30,630 --> 00:44:36,028
two traits were interested in so in fact

767
00:44:33,690 --> 00:44:38,009
this is this is a genetic correlation

768
00:44:36,028 --> 00:44:40,528
because we are correlating sort of this

769
00:44:38,009 --> 00:44:44,519
is the proxy looks like looks like a

770
00:44:40,528 --> 00:44:47,159
billion value okay so we did this for

771
00:44:44,518 --> 00:44:49,348
two traits we're interested in joining

772
00:44:47,159 --> 00:44:54,088
Manta and B durometer and fresh fuel and

773
00:44:49,349 --> 00:44:56,579
so on so what later did we use we use

774
00:44:54,088 --> 00:44:58,528
the same data we were using for we used

775
00:44:56,579 --> 00:45:01,859
for the air hm

776
00:44:58,528 --> 00:45:05,429
we applied these to the same populations

777
00:45:01,858 --> 00:45:07,798
again white yellow and in this case we

778
00:45:05,429 --> 00:45:13,469
also joined them together we call yellow

779
00:45:07,798 --> 00:45:16,108
plus y okay so we applied also for dry

780
00:45:13,469 --> 00:45:19,078
matter and unfresh huge in so-called

781
00:45:16,108 --> 00:45:21,690
high starched white trials and these are

782
00:45:19,079 --> 00:45:25,769
trials that had high levels of dry

783
00:45:21,690 --> 00:45:28,490
matter and and and good yield and they

784
00:45:25,768 --> 00:45:33,479
were they were planted sort of to

785
00:45:28,489 --> 00:45:35,669
understand when best to harvest and one

786
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:38,309
one set of harvests was done twelve

787
00:45:35,670 --> 00:45:40,798
months after planting and the second set

788
00:45:38,309 --> 00:45:44,359
of harvests was done 14 months after

789
00:45:40,798 --> 00:45:46,920
planting so we plot this segment

790
00:45:44,358 --> 00:45:50,670
correlations genome-wide to see what's

791
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:55,110
going on and excuse me

792
00:45:50,670 --> 00:45:57,360
then we also tried to say that when

793
00:45:55,110 --> 00:45:59,730
these segment correlations are going in

794
00:45:57,360 --> 00:46:02,730
in the direction that the breeder wants

795
00:45:59,730 --> 00:46:05,039
then they are favorable for for what you

796
00:46:02,730 --> 00:46:07,320
are looking for we use so-called

797
00:46:05,039 --> 00:46:14,159
residuary sampling for significance

798
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:18,090
testing okay I show here plots each bar

799
00:46:14,159 --> 00:46:21,929
represents a segment change of color

800
00:46:18,090 --> 00:46:27,390
represents another chromosome and this

801
00:46:21,929 --> 00:46:30,509
is for white and we see that most of the

802
00:46:27,389 --> 00:46:39,779
segments are in the in the positive

803
00:46:30,510 --> 00:46:43,590
direction and in yellow in yellow we see

804
00:46:39,780 --> 00:46:49,830
that most of these segments are going

805
00:46:43,590 --> 00:46:52,890
towards the negative direction this is

806
00:46:49,829 --> 00:47:00,029
for white mixed with yellow or we see a

807
00:46:52,889 --> 00:47:01,920
mixture of what is going on okay so we

808
00:47:00,030 --> 00:47:05,519
see seventy percent of the segments and

809
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:09,769
white were favorable and in fact from

810
00:47:05,519 --> 00:47:14,929
the bivariate model we saw that genomic

811
00:47:09,769 --> 00:47:17,730
the trait rates correlation was 0.14

812
00:47:14,929 --> 00:47:21,989
which indicates progress can be made

813
00:47:17,730 --> 00:47:24,150
using a multi trait index so we move

814
00:47:21,989 --> 00:47:29,069
over to yellow which is more interesting

815
00:47:24,150 --> 00:47:33,360
and we see that each 1% of the segment's

816
00:47:29,070 --> 00:47:36,600
were unfavorable and the whole genome

817
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:39,329
genomic relations where negative zero

818
00:47:36,599 --> 00:47:42,860
point three indicating that develop in

819
00:47:39,329 --> 00:47:45,869
yellow cassava could be challenging so

820
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:49,860
interestingly this doesn't happen in the

821
00:47:45,869 --> 00:47:52,769
South American gem plasm so sabalos has

822
00:47:49,860 --> 00:47:56,220
has this publication and has been saying

823
00:47:52,769 --> 00:47:59,639
that just a recurrent selection was

824
00:47:56,219 --> 00:48:01,048
