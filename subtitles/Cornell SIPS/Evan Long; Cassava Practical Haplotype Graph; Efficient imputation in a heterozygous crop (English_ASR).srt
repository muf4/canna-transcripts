1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,320
this is a production of cornell

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:04,320
university

3
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:11,679
um thanks everyone thanks for the

4
00:00:09,439 --> 00:00:12,239
introduction uh just to know i am part

5
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:15,599
of the

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:18,560
buckler and robin's labs uh co-mentored

7
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:20,560
um so yeah today i'm going to talk about

8
00:00:18,559 --> 00:00:22,719
a cassava practical haplotype graph

9
00:00:20,559 --> 00:00:23,839
for efficient amputation and hepatitis

10
00:00:22,719 --> 00:00:27,278
crop

11
00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:28,719
all right okay sorry um so first i want

12
00:00:27,278 --> 00:00:29,439
to talk about andrew's kind of what is a

13
00:00:28,719 --> 00:00:33,200
practical

14
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:34,960
type graph uh it's a tool for amputation

15
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,520
to help capture genomic variants across

16
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:40,399
the genome with minimal sequence input

17
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:41,600
so that's kind of the purpose of it and

18
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:43,200
why would we impute

19
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,600
uh there's a lot of different reasons to

20
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,239
but some of the main ones in breeding we

21
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,079
think about

22
00:00:46,238 --> 00:00:50,878
are kind of allowing data from different

23
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:52,799
genotypic sources to be used together

24
00:00:50,878 --> 00:00:54,079
and also to kind of capture more whole

25
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:56,839
genome variants for

26
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:58,719
maybe leverage other additional uh

27
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:01,600
annotations

28
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:03,920
um so just a basic kind of layout of

29
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,198
what making a phd looks like

30
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:08,159
basically take some whole genome

31
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:10,640
sequence um sometimes in

32
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:12,719
assemblies extract haplotypes and

33
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,719
populate a database

34
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:16,560
then we take to kind of test it we take

35
00:01:14,719 --> 00:01:17,920
some low coverage genotyping

36
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,159
pass it through the alignment of the

37
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:24,640
database and get out

38
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:24,640
basically all the haplotypes

39
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:30,319
so how does it work um

40
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,478
well first we break up the genome into

41
00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:33,839
these haplotype ranges we call reference

42
00:01:32,478 --> 00:01:35,519
ranges

43
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,079
uh we then populate the database with

44
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:39,359
haplotypes from some parental germplasm

45
00:01:38,078 --> 00:01:42,719
or

46
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:43,920
diversity panel um and then we make a

47
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:45,280
trellis graph this

48
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,840
is a graph structure that kind of

49
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:51,439
captures the relationship between

50
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:54,799
adjacent haplotypes and um

51
00:01:51,438 --> 00:01:57,438
now we have this because genome um

52
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:59,040
we can take maybe an un genotype taxa

53
00:01:57,438 --> 00:02:01,758
get some reads for it

54
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,399
align it to the band genome what this is

55
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:04,239
gonna

56
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:05,519
then we're gonna use a hidden markov

57
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:07,839
model

58
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:08,719
to find the most likely path through the

59
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:11,039
database

60
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:13,598
which then gives us our haplotype for

61
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:16,000
that new tax cell

62
00:02:13,598 --> 00:02:17,439
uh but it's not just that simple because

63
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,400
working in a heterozygous crop like

64
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:19,919
cassava

65
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,400
you have to model two copies of the

66
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:24,719
genome so instead we you know we line

67
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,400
the reeds but they hit multiple places

68
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:28,719
and we then get the two most likely

69
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:31,280
paths uh representing the two copies of

70
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:31,280
the genome

71
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:34,959
so first i just want to introduce kind

72
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:37,360
of what this looks like in simulation

73
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:38,800
simulations can help us kind of test our

74
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,480
methodology

75
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,160
look see what things look like under

76
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:44,479
ideal conditions

77
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:45,840
um and so the simulation i'm going to

78
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:48,878
show here basically take

79
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:50,239
20 parents these are cassava real self

80
00:02:48,878 --> 00:02:51,759
self-clones

81
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:54,239
simulate five generations of random

82
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:57,519
mating and then i my test amputation in

83
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:58,480
100 offspring and so just a test

84
00:02:57,519 --> 00:02:59,920
invitation

85
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:02,318
would sample the offspring at low

86
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:02,318
coverage

87
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:05,759
use the phd to impute the missing

88
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:07,280
genotypes

89
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:08,560
determine accuracy by comparing it to

90
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,598
the true which we know because the

91
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,920
simulation

92
00:03:09,598 --> 00:03:13,759
and then compare also uh how it does

93
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:15,119
with invitation to beagle which is very

94
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:18,719
common imputation

95
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:20,800
uh software that people use um

96
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:22,400
so this is what it looks like at least

97
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:25,120
for the simulation

98
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:27,439
we see the ph g in red i can't see my

99
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:30,959
mouse but um

100
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:33,598
you know the ph g in red outperforms

101
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:35,920
beagle in the simulated scenario across

102
00:03:33,598 --> 00:03:37,119
many the x-axis is depth of coverage for

103
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:40,399
sequencing

104
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:41,599
so um but so and this this big gap

105
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,719
between them especially the lower

106
00:03:41,598 --> 00:03:44,719
coverages

107
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:46,639
that's really due to the fact that the

108
00:03:44,719 --> 00:03:48,719
beagle can't really distinguish between

109
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:51,759
heterozygous and homozygous calls

110
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:53,120
with that little of data so just because

111
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:54,479
if you see something once you don't know

112
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,480
if that's homozygous

113
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:59,039
maybe it's uh maybe you're not capturing

114
00:03:56,479 --> 00:04:02,158
the second allele

115
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:02,560
um so now i've shown this really should

116
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:05,679
work

117
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:07,120
it does work in simulation um

118
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,120
even with two copies of the genome being

119
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:11,200
modeled um

120
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,039
the question is where do we get the

121
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:15,598
haplotypes for

122
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:16,319
for real data um because it's not quite

123
00:04:15,598 --> 00:04:18,399
as simple as

124
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:20,000
as it may look so what i'm going to

125
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:21,279
showing you some of the data i'm using

126
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,439
from the hapmap 2

127
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:24,879
population created or kind of

128
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:28,000
consolidated a few years ago

129
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:30,879
by remo and the and the bucker lab

130
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,319
it's got 241 clones mainly from some

131
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:34,800
cultivated varieties but

132
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:36,159
our columns but also for there's some

133
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:39,199
wild uh

134
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:41,439
lines in there as well so how do we find

135
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:42,400
haplotypes well one of the problem

136
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:45,360
challenges i'm going to

137
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:46,959
talk about is getting phased haplotypes

138
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:49,040
is not as easy as it sounds

139
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:50,879
from whole genome sequence uh just

140
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,639
imagine these three sites

141
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:53,918
uh two of which are segregating we've

142
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:56,160
got heterozygous at

143
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:58,159
sites one and three oh so you're like

144
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,960
okay we've got the genotype

145
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,600
but that is not a haplotype um we don't

146
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:03,279
know

147
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:06,160
if the genome looks like this with two

148
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:09,279
haplotypes acg and cct

149
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:11,919
or act and ccg

150
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:14,000
and so even with two snips or two

151
00:05:11,918 --> 00:05:17,198
celerying sites this can be harder to

152
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:20,000
to distinguish and in reality it's much

153
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:20,560
bigger for more possibilities than just

154
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,519
these two

155
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:25,199
you know with more stamps so how can we

156
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:27,918
resolve the true phase

157
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:28,478
uh what we can do and what we show here

158
00:05:27,918 --> 00:05:31,198
is

159
00:05:28,478 --> 00:05:33,519
we sample enough of these clones so we

160
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:35,520
can find clones that are homozygous

161
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:37,038
at these at this region for these

162
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:39,519
different haplotypes and we can see

163
00:05:37,038 --> 00:05:41,519
oh here maybe the true phase is actually

164
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:44,478
acg and cct

165
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:46,000
and so looking for these ibd or identity

166
00:05:44,478 --> 00:05:49,038
by descent regions

167
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,639
uh we can get the true phase of these

168
00:05:49,038 --> 00:05:53,199
haplotypes

169
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:54,960
and so that's how we created the i've

170
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:56,160
created this cassava database so this

171
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:57,758
phe

172
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,680
is by sampling the ibd regions of the

173
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:01,038
genome and and using those runs of

174
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,800
homozygosity

175
00:06:01,038 --> 00:06:04,079
that were most likely generated through

176
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:08,240
you know breeding

177
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:09,680
or selection and we then also capture if

178
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,319
there are runs of homosexual

179
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:13,759
relationships

180
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:16,639
between adjacent haplotypes

181
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:18,319
um and not only that but one of the

182
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:20,240
things we have to address is that this

183
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:21,919
method is going to kind of create a

184
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,759
sparse database because

185
00:06:21,918 --> 00:06:25,439
not every haplotype is being sampled in

186
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:27,439
every tax set

187
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:29,600
and so here this is the same picture i

188
00:06:27,439 --> 00:06:30,959
showed before with some missing habitats

189
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,280
one of the things we've done to kind of

190
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:35,038
make this viable

191
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:36,799
is by taking the reeds from these

192
00:06:35,038 --> 00:06:39,599
haplotypes we've sampled

193
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:41,439
we actually realign them to the graph

194
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:44,080
and find the most likely paths

195
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:45,279
and and fill in those gaps with most

196
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:47,680
likely haplotypes from the

197
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:49,359
types of samples with this realigning of

198
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,959
the whole genome sequence data does is

199
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,639
it fills in the gaps

200
00:06:50,959 --> 00:06:54,079
to kind of fill up the graph to improve

201
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:56,478
the transitions and the

202
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:59,598
the model as a whole but doesn't add any

203
00:06:56,478 --> 00:07:02,879
new information or new haplotypes

204
00:06:59,598 --> 00:07:07,120
and so now i'll just show uh we

205
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:09,519
run an imputation from this uh

206
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,959
phg and same kind of thing with the

207
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:13,918
other tests but i held out

208
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:15,680
a test set that were not sampled sampled

209
00:07:13,918 --> 00:07:19,038
their reads to a low coverage

210
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:22,160
and impute the missing sites and so here

211
00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:22,879
the results from that and um you'll see

212
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,439
it it's

213
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:27,038
it's not the beagles follows the same

214
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:29,839
relationship as it did in simulation but

215
00:07:27,038 --> 00:07:32,560
with this phd

216
00:07:29,839 --> 00:07:34,478
it's the same trend but it's translated

217
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:37,280
lower on the graph and what

218
00:07:34,478 --> 00:07:39,279
uh we're seeing here is that uh we're

219
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:41,519
not completely able by

220
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:43,439
this method isn't completely able to

221
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:46,799
sample all the haplotypes

222
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:50,000
the diversity happen types either due to

223
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:53,038
deleterious um alleles

224
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,560
or other population dependent

225
00:07:53,038 --> 00:07:58,959
parameters you know we might not be

226
00:07:54,560 --> 00:08:01,199
exampling all the available haplotypes

227
00:07:58,959 --> 00:08:02,959
um just to interrupt you a second but if

228
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:06,160
somebody's got a baby can you please

229
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:09,279
that's my baby that's okay oh sorry

230
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:10,960
no i'm that's i try to apologize but um

231
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:13,359
that just makes it adorable carry on

232
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:16,959
okay

233
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:18,879
um so we've shown okay

234
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:21,279
but it does do really well with the low

235
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:24,000
coverages uh compared to beagle

236
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:25,918
but how well is good enough so just try

237
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,800
to validate this with some genomic

238
00:08:25,918 --> 00:08:28,560
prediction

239
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,400
how does this imputation accuracy

240
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,958
translate to genomic prediction

241
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:33,519
so i've just used a subset of clones

242
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:36,158
from this

243
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:38,080
hat map did some cross validations with

244
00:08:36,158 --> 00:08:40,559
fresh root yield

245
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:42,158
and i found that it follows pretty much

246
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:43,199
the same trend as the amputation

247
00:08:42,158 --> 00:08:45,919
accuracy

248
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:47,519
as the genomic prediction accuracy um

249
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:49,439
and that it yeah the highest coverage

250
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:51,839
beagle is going to do better

251
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,800
because it it can kind of leverage the

252
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:56,880
information that

253
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:59,679
the phd can't um

254
00:08:56,879 --> 00:09:00,399
but it is we are you know these are

255
00:08:59,679 --> 00:09:03,519
upwards of

256
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:06,159
you know near if

257
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:07,839
if the beagle 5x is the top amount of

258
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:08,639
genomic prediction accuracy we can get

259
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:12,160
just with

260
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:13,278
0.5 x coverage uh the phd can get near

261
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:17,199
that i would say you know

262
00:09:13,278 --> 00:09:18,480
um and so kind of this brings us the

263
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,399
question is

264
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,000
if it can do pretty well it you know it

265
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:23,440
does affect it at low coverage

266
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,879
how can we sample more haplotypes

267
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,519
because that seems to be just the last

268
00:09:24,879 --> 00:09:27,919
piece

269
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:30,320
um to make this an effective tool in a

270
00:09:27,919 --> 00:09:34,479
heterozygous crop like cassava

271
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:36,720
so here i'm just going to show um some

272
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,480
preliminary data i've got from using

273
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,440
long read technology oxford nanopore

274
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:43,120
technology

275
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:46,240
or minion sequencing so here

276
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:48,879
i've got six clones um

277
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:49,759
uh that have oxford nanopore data i take

278
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:53,278
those clones

279
00:09:49,759 --> 00:09:54,559
their wgs data and use um long reads to

280
00:09:53,278 --> 00:09:56,399
phase their data

281
00:09:54,559 --> 00:09:58,479
and i make it i've made a phd database

282
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:01,120
just with those six lines

283
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:02,720
uh and then i'm gonna compare it to the

284
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:05,919
phd i just showed which

285
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:08,959
is made from the whole hat map too

286
00:10:05,919 --> 00:10:12,159
um so here's what it looks like and

287
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:13,679
it is lower but it includes data from

288
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:16,399
far fewer taxa

289
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:18,000
and so uh i wasn't able to get this huge

290
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:19,600
bump in accuracy even i didn't show this

291
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,200
but even by combining them i don't get

292
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:24,320
that bump in accuracy

293
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:25,759
that i'd like but um this does show a

294
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:29,040
lot of potential for

295
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:31,360
maybe if you had a breeding population

296
00:10:29,039 --> 00:10:33,360
if you sequence the parents with

297
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:35,519
um some long reads and short reads

298
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:37,039
together and get the face table types

299
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:40,320
then you can use those

300
00:10:37,039 --> 00:10:41,519
to effectively uh impute in the

301
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:45,360
offspring or the

302
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:47,120
in yes so just last i want to summarize

303
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,720
my points is the cassava phd can

304
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,959
leverage ibd haplotypes to get

305
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:54,320
good imputation accuracy that is

306
00:10:50,958 --> 00:10:55,838
applicable for general prediction

307
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,760
simulation experiments help us validate

308
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:59,680
and improve our methodology

309
00:10:57,759 --> 00:11:01,838
it shows its real potential if we have

310
00:10:59,679 --> 00:11:04,000
correctly faced apple types

311
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:05,360
and lastly um you know there is some

312
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,240
potential to use these long-range

313
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:09,039
technologies

314
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:10,399
as they get cheaper and more available

315
00:11:09,039 --> 00:11:14,399
to kind of solve the

316
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:15,600
phasing problem and last i'll just uh

317
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:17,919
want to acknowledge everyone that's

318
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:20,800
helped me both uh my mentors kelly and

319
00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:21,360
ed and all the the lab members that have

320
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:23,599
helped me

321
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,120
uh and especially a big shout out for

322
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:28,000
peter bradberry

323
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:29,600
whose uh programming work is you know

324
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,120
mostly support a lot of the results i

325
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,519
have is due to a lot of the work he's

326
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:35,839
done

327
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:38,639
and i will take any questions thank you

328
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:39,760
thank you for your talk evan um so yeah

329
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:42,399
you can either write

330
00:11:39,759 --> 00:11:44,399
the questions in the chat or you can

331
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:46,559
also raise your hand if you would like

332
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:46,559
to

333
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:51,439
evan i think you need to show us the

334
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,440
baby

335
00:11:53,519 --> 00:12:00,889
you said she was

336
00:11:57,250 --> 00:12:00,889
[Laughter]

337
00:12:01,669 --> 00:12:04,719
[Music]

338
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:10,959
um if we want to start with liz

339
00:12:09,278 --> 00:12:12,559
do you want to unmute yourself and ask

340
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:15,119
your question

341
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:15,119
hi evan

342
00:12:15,679 --> 00:12:18,958
can you hear me okay yes sorry liz i

343
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:22,000
just uh

344
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:23,759
didn't see you yeah this is liz so i was

345
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,078
interested in those last results on the

346
00:12:23,759 --> 00:12:26,480
long-range sequencing why you did not

347
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:29,039
get

348
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:30,800
better resolution and better accuracy is

349
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:32,639
that because the method itself is

350
00:12:30,799 --> 00:12:35,838
inherently

351
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:37,039
error-prone um so it's like i said still

352
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:40,240
some preliminary data

353
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:41,919
i think um

354
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:43,759
so i think what it shows is that we're

355
00:12:41,919 --> 00:12:44,399
able to phase some haplotypes correctly

356
00:12:43,759 --> 00:12:46,639
which

357
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:48,639
with short reads i've tried phasing with

358
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:50,560
other methods and it doesn't help

359
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:51,680
you know trying to giving face apple

360
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:53,359
types to

361
00:12:51,679 --> 00:12:54,799
uh incorporating face appetite doesn't

362
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,839
help but with the long reads it

363
00:12:54,799 --> 00:12:58,319
it looks like we're getting accurate

364
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:59,440
haplotypes um

365
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,600
and i think it's probably just a

366
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,000
limitation of only being able to have

367
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:05,600
those

368
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:09,039
few only six clones having that data

369
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:11,600
would probably be the limitation i'd um

370
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:13,120
and why it wouldn't improve the i i

371
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:16,079
still need to look into it more

372
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:18,078
um because i've tried combining both the

373
00:13:16,078 --> 00:13:19,838
ibd haplotypes and those

374
00:13:18,078 --> 00:13:21,359
phase apple types and it hasn't really

375
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:25,120
improved better than

376
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:27,919
my big ibd database um

377
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:29,039
yeah that haplotype imputation can they

378
00:13:27,919 --> 00:13:31,199
can get chimeric

379
00:13:29,039 --> 00:13:32,719
forms of sequencing for the long range

380
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,320
sequencing method so i wondered whether

381
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:37,920
you were seeing some of that

382
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:39,760
yeah um i have looked at chimera

383
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:41,838
you know like creating kind of these

384
00:13:39,759 --> 00:13:45,198
false haplotypes before

385
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:47,040
and um that may be part of it or maybe

386
00:13:45,198 --> 00:13:49,198
just that we're not it's not

387
00:13:47,039 --> 00:13:50,159
like all the haplotypes that i'm getting

388
00:13:49,198 --> 00:13:52,319
with the

389
00:13:50,159 --> 00:13:53,759
with the long read phasing may be

390
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:56,240
already captured by all the

391
00:13:53,759 --> 00:13:57,120
ibd apple types right that could be one

392
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:00,799
thing

393
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:02,000
um but that is you know that's kind of

394
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:04,559
my running hypothesis right

395
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,919
now it would i mean i don't have the

396
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:07,039
data for it really but it would be

397
00:14:05,919 --> 00:14:09,198
interesting if i had

398
00:14:07,039 --> 00:14:10,799
once again if i had offspring i've tried

399
00:14:09,198 --> 00:14:12,639
looking there's not really pedigr

400
00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:16,559
there's not at least whole genome

401
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:17,919
sequence on the pedigree data i have um

402
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:21,919
you know if i could look at the direct

403
00:14:17,919 --> 00:14:26,159
offspring of those uh six clones

404
00:14:21,919 --> 00:14:28,719
thanks very nice thank you evan

405
00:14:26,159 --> 00:14:29,439
there was another raised hand by

406
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,680
jean-luc

407
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:33,199
i don't know um he took his hand back i

408
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:33,599
don't know what he's done i i loaded it

409
00:14:33,198 --> 00:14:36,719
but

410
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:39,360
i'm sure um evan so the uh

411
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:41,759
the simulation what what data did you

412
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,800
actually give the phd in constructing it

413
00:14:41,759 --> 00:14:46,240
did you give it

414
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:49,599
the fully phased data on the 20 parents

415
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:52,000
yeah so i phased 20 parents just using

416
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:53,519
beagle and hap cut and i just gave the

417
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,879
phd and explained or

418
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:57,039
because that's what i used to simulate

419
00:14:54,879 --> 00:14:58,320
the offspring and so i gave that to the

420
00:14:57,039 --> 00:15:01,439
phd as well

421
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:02,320
i mean those are no by no means true i

422
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,920
just accept sure

423
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:06,000
it's true right right right i get it

424
00:15:03,919 --> 00:15:09,360
yeah okay so um

425
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:11,919
yeah does that answer your question

426
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,720
it does i i guess uh yeah that makes

427
00:15:11,919 --> 00:15:15,198
sense thanks

428
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,839
and they're all iita lines so at least

429
00:15:15,198 --> 00:15:19,198
they're all

430
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:19,199
somewhat related anyways

431
00:15:23,278 --> 00:15:26,559
you know we never really got a good view

432
00:15:24,879 --> 00:15:28,480
of the baby because

433
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:32,078
people were talking and then zoom puts

434
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:40,639
them on the screen or at least i didn't

435
00:15:32,078 --> 00:15:44,078
there were some backlighting issues

436
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:46,799
thank you so much oh wonderful

437
00:15:44,078 --> 00:15:48,078
very cute um there's one more question

438
00:15:46,799 --> 00:15:51,838
from shitai

439
00:15:48,078 --> 00:15:53,838
in the chat she asks which method

440
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:55,120
among the two you would recommend for

441
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:58,320
either irl

442
00:15:55,120 --> 00:16:01,839
or diverse populations um

443
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:02,399
i think if i had the ability to get long

444
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:05,680
reads

445
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:07,870
i would especially if you had

446
00:16:05,679 --> 00:16:09,919
like a finite number of parents you knew

447
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:11,839
[Music]

448
00:16:09,919 --> 00:16:13,198
okay uh if you had something like you

449
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:14,880
said if we said something

450
00:16:13,198 --> 00:16:16,479
in maize you know if you had something

451
00:16:14,879 --> 00:16:17,919
like the name

452
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:19,920
if you get long readings of those

453
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:23,759
parents and then look have those

454
00:16:19,919 --> 00:16:26,000
faith effects okay well

455
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:27,919
i better cut off but thank you and thank

456
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:31,278
you for the questions

457
00:16:27,919 --> 00:16:33,120
thanks for your talk evan um yeah george

458
00:16:31,278 --> 00:16:37,838
will introduce the third and last

459
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:37,839
