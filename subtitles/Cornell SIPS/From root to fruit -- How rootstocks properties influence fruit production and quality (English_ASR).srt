1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:04,960
this is a production of cornell

2
00:00:02,319 --> 00:00:04,960
university

3
00:00:09,039 --> 00:00:14,000
and thanks for having me

4
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:15,440
for the seminar

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,320
um

6
00:00:15,439 --> 00:00:20,079
from root to fruit so uh i'm i'm an

7
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,160
apple rooster creator

8
00:00:20,079 --> 00:00:24,479
uh i've been

9
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:25,920
um an apple extra reader now for about

10
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,080
12 years i

11
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,320
i guess when i started i had uh very

12
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:32,558
little idea what

13
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,759
apple roosters wear

14
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:36,000
and

15
00:00:33,759 --> 00:00:36,000
and

16
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:42,480
i had to

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,039
kind of grow up and and

18
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:46,878
come to an understanding of what they

19
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:50,160
what they wear thanks to

20
00:00:46,878 --> 00:00:52,558
uh the help of of a couple other people

21
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:55,439
on our team herbalinko

22
00:00:52,558 --> 00:00:57,839
and terence robinson who have been

23
00:00:55,439 --> 00:01:00,558
very supportive of the program

24
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:02,800
in geneva and then here is uh jim

25
00:01:00,558 --> 00:01:06,079
cummings the many of the crosses that

26
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:07,759
i'm still i'm working on were performed

27
00:01:06,079 --> 00:01:09,118
by

28
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:12,880
jim cummings

29
00:01:09,118 --> 00:01:13,920
he retired quite a while ago the rest of

30
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:16,000
the

31
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,240
rootstock team is

32
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,400
at least sarah bauer

33
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:22,319
and todd holleran

34
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,240
and i'd like to remember

35
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:26,719
charlie who passed away

36
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:29,759
a few years back um

37
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:31,840
a uh many of the trees that

38
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:32,879
we collect data today

39
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,640
um

40
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:36,158
were either

41
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:39,359
planted by him

42
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:41,840
uh budded by him or or

43
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:44,799
or propagated by

44
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:46,640
by him and so i um i'd like to always

45
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:47,840
recognize his contribution to the

46
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,680
program

47
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:52,399
um

48
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:54,640
my activity is called a cornell

49
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:58,239
i lead the appaloosa breeding program

50
00:01:54,640 --> 00:02:00,560
it's a joint uh cornell and nars program

51
00:01:58,239 --> 00:02:01,359
i advise graduate students i participate

52
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,359
in

53
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:05,118
in committees

54
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:07,920
either

55
00:02:05,118 --> 00:02:09,598
local committees at the geneva stations

56
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:13,120
or other committees and then i

57
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:16,959
collaborate with the cornell scientists

58
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:19,599
and cctech to advance the implementation

59
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:22,400
of these new technologies that that we

60
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:23,280
are developing um

61
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,360
and

62
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:28,080
i also participate in some extension

63
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:31,599
activities and field days talks and so

64
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:34,800
on so forth as i'm asked

65
00:02:31,598 --> 00:02:36,959
so those are my activities at cornell

66
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,160
research work however on apple restocks

67
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:42,319
requires

68
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:42,318
a lot more collaboration than

69
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:48,719
than just what we are able to do at

70
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:51,120
geneva and so we have collaborations

71
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:54,878
with washington state

72
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,840
usci rs in several different locations

73
00:02:54,878 --> 00:03:00,479
and

74
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:02,878
and also the collaboration of the nc 140

75
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:05,439
scientists that are all over the u.s and

76
00:03:02,878 --> 00:03:08,318
plus internationally

77
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:13,199
we have field trials anywhere from

78
00:03:08,318 --> 00:03:14,719
south korea to south africa and

79
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:16,839
in poland

80
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:19,199
so if you can imagine all upper growing

81
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:22,319
regions um

82
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:23,839
a little bit of a historical perspective

83
00:03:22,318 --> 00:03:26,158
we have released

84
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,840
quite a bit of germplasm uh

85
00:03:26,158 --> 00:03:28,959
up to to

86
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,319
this day

87
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:33,680
and

88
00:03:30,318 --> 00:03:36,158
this kind of tells you a little bit

89
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,120
where i'm coming from and and

90
00:03:36,158 --> 00:03:40,639
how

91
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:41,759
uh breeding for a crop that has a

92
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:45,199
20

93
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:47,598
15 to 20 year cycle in terms of

94
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:49,759
from the time you you plant the seed to

95
00:03:47,598 --> 00:03:51,280
the time you have something that is a

96
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:53,598
product

97
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:55,280
it's a it takes a little bit different

98
00:03:53,598 --> 00:03:58,959
approach than than something that you

99
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:00,560
can cycle for 20 times a year

100
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:02,158
so

101
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,199
we

102
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:05,519
i

103
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:07,039
want to acknowledge that in 1960s the

104
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:09,438
year i was born

105
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:10,639
and robusta phi was identified as a good

106
00:04:09,438 --> 00:04:11,438
parent

107
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:14,958
uh

108
00:04:11,438 --> 00:04:17,358
for for that and and uh and

109
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:20,319
dr cummings retired uh right here and

110
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:21,680
then dr l winkle retired uh these past

111
00:04:20,319 --> 00:04:25,680
couple years but

112
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:27,519
uh we released uh since my joining um

113
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,400
the the group released several root

114
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:31,839
stocks

115
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:35,279
that you'll see are having a

116
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:38,159
major effect in apple production

117
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:39,758
now here in the us and in the world so i

118
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,639
figured that

119
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:43,680
maybe this here we'll have

120
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:45,519
uh

121
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:48,000
for bruce ducks alone the finished trees

122
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:50,000
it's it's a to make a finished tree it

123
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,478
takes a couple years but we'll probably

124
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,519
have about uh three to four million

125
00:04:52,478 --> 00:04:55,120
plants

126
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:58,079
planted

127
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:59,280
uh and and this is going to

128
00:04:58,079 --> 00:05:01,359
increase

129
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:04,879
every single year

130
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:08,800
as you can see this is g41 and and it's

131
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:08,800
going up there this is g11

132
00:05:08,839 --> 00:05:15,198
and um these were numbers that were

133
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:17,038
calculated in uh early 20 2013 so we

134
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:18,319
don't have the the newest numbers yet

135
00:05:17,038 --> 00:05:21,360
but they're uh

136
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:24,639
the projections are are fairly good

137
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:26,319
and uh what does that mean that means

138
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:28,319
more plants that are resistant to fire

139
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:31,599
blight more plants that are replant

140
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:34,079
tolerant are going into the hands of of

141
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:36,800
growers

142
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:37,599
i recently attended a

143
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,600
or

144
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:42,000
presenting a seminar in illinois and and

145
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,439
i had a grower come back to me who was a

146
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,399
uh

147
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:47,439
a small uh pick your own operation and

148
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:49,439
he said

149
00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:52,719
you know without without these root

150
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:55,519
stocks we would not be in business

151
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,479
and that's that's that that put put me

152
00:05:55,519 --> 00:05:59,359
better

153
00:05:56,478 --> 00:06:01,918
back in perspective of of how important

154
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:04,160
the work that that we're doing

155
00:06:01,918 --> 00:06:05,120
in geneva is

156
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:08,080
so

157
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,959
here you see some um

158
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:09,918
maybe

159
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:13,038
there's a

160
00:06:09,918 --> 00:06:16,079
hundred thousand plants in just in this

161
00:06:13,038 --> 00:06:17,599
and uh we have propagation everywhere in

162
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:21,038
in oregon and

163
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:23,039
and uh now also

164
00:06:21,038 --> 00:06:25,360
we have the nurseries in new york state

165
00:06:23,038 --> 00:06:27,918
that participate

166
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:29,759
in propagation of geneva rootstocks

167
00:06:27,918 --> 00:06:32,240
and of course

168
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:33,199
we used to have some issues with

169
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,199
with

170
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:36,639
uh propagation because the rootstocks

171
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:39,360
are selected for

172
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:42,319
uh performance in the field and

173
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:43,840
not as much as for performance in in the

174
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:45,680
stool beds

175
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:47,839
but as you can see here this is

176
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:50,000
propagation by cuttings someone had the

177
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:51,198
idea well you know let's do cuttings out

178
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,720
of these and

179
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:58,560
and uh a couple years later 800 000

180
00:06:54,720 --> 00:07:02,800
plants come out every uh every season so

181
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:06,079
um i and i i'm proud of of

182
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:09,038
the nursery industry and how much they

183
00:07:06,079 --> 00:07:10,879
have adopted uh our material and and

184
00:07:09,038 --> 00:07:13,360
been able to work with it

185
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:15,038
and work with the kinks

186
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:17,280
so this is uh

187
00:07:15,038 --> 00:07:20,079
this is our program

188
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:23,519
in uh in a uh

189
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:26,478
nutshell uh biggest words rootstocks

190
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:28,639
apple and breeding we our apples are not

191
00:07:26,478 --> 00:07:29,680
good they don't taste very good but

192
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:32,720
and

193
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:34,560
susan brown teases me about that um

194
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:37,360
but i i can uh

195
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:40,319
the the good thing is that i can make

196
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:43,680
her apple trees uh produce better and

197
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:45,280
and higher quality apples

198
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,680
so

199
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:47,679
um

200
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:52,079
forward

201
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:54,878
so this is this is how apple production

202
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:55,680
was about a hundred years ago

203
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:57,280
uh

204
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,478
big ladders and

205
00:07:57,279 --> 00:08:00,559
and uh

206
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:02,639
everybody had to go out and hopefully

207
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,319
you bring the whole family and

208
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:06,160
have sometimes

209
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:09,280
people just

210
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:11,680
falling off the ladder sometimes

211
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:13,198
and carrying big bags

212
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:16,879
and this is the way

213
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:19,520
it is it is nowadays in in some cases

214
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:21,759
the apples are placed very uh tightly

215
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:24,878
and very neatly

216
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:27,759
they calculate how much

217
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:29,360
how much a a single branch can can hold

218
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:31,280
or how many apples can

219
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:33,038
uh a single branch can hold and then

220
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:35,918
they thin to that uh

221
00:08:33,038 --> 00:08:39,120
amount uh so it's pretty impressive to

222
00:08:35,918 --> 00:08:39,120
see that and

223
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:43,599
that

224
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:46,240
would not have been possible without

225
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:48,000
the dwarfing effect of the apple

226
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:50,159
roosters confer so

227
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,240
you see this transition from big trees

228
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:53,838
to here's a big tree that doesn't have

229
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,680
the dwarfing jeans in the small tree

230
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:57,279
that has the dwarfing gene

231
00:08:55,679 --> 00:08:59,919
you can see the effect

232
00:08:57,278 --> 00:09:01,439
also in fruit

233
00:08:59,919 --> 00:09:04,399
fruit density

234
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,600
per square centimeter of trunk

235
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:08,480
and

236
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:10,720
that made this possible which meant

237
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:13,360
less letter accidents less more

238
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:15,839
ergonomics for for picking increased

239
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:18,080
productivity

240
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:20,160
i figured that the productivity went up

241
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:21,360
about

242
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:25,838
in current

243
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:28,080
money uh 750

244
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:30,080
million uh half a million half a billion

245
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:33,680
to 750

246
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:38,399
million dollars in the u.s just based on

247
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:39,759
on the uh dwarfing effect so

248
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:42,480
um

249
00:09:39,759 --> 00:09:45,519
a while back we figured out what the

250
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:48,399
dwarfing effect was uh was caused by in

251
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:50,639
our program we did we did some

252
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:52,879
quantitative genetics

253
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:52,879
and

254
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:59,439
we identify the additional locus that

255
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:59,440
that causes

256
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:07,039
the dwarfing effect and and also related

257
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:09,679
to the induction of early bearing in in

258
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:13,278
apple science

259
00:10:09,679 --> 00:10:13,278
and long story short

260
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:19,200
the evaluations here

261
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,560
spanned about uh

262
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,480
i would say

263
00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:24,559
seven to nine years

264
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,680
uh so if you're looking for a quick

265
00:10:24,559 --> 00:10:28,239
paper

266
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:32,078
sorry this apple restaurants are not uh

267
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:33,120
not what you're uh looking for

268
00:10:32,078 --> 00:10:35,679
but

269
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:38,078
long story short there are two loci

270
00:10:35,679 --> 00:10:41,439
that interact with each other and they

271
00:10:38,078 --> 00:10:43,759
affect the size of the tree

272
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:48,000
as well as the productivity of the tree

273
00:10:43,759 --> 00:10:50,240
and only certain combinations of alleles

274
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,120
give the highest production

275
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,278
so

276
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:55,519
nowadays i can

277
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:58,078
go into a

278
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:59,519
marker assisted selection scheme and

279
00:10:58,078 --> 00:11:01,838
select four

280
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:01,839
for

281
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:06,480
a certain combination of alleles and

282
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:08,159
predictably

283
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,079
develop root stocks that can produce

284
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:12,559
higher

285
00:11:10,078 --> 00:11:14,958
more apples and and have a certain size

286
00:11:12,559 --> 00:11:17,518
of tree

287
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:17,518
part of our

288
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:23,200
arsenal that that we developed

289
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:26,319
in this process was

290
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:27,920
a set of eqtls

291
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:30,399
that

292
00:11:27,919 --> 00:11:31,679
segregated in one of our

293
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:34,000
big population one of the main

294
00:11:31,679 --> 00:11:36,000
populations that we have eqtl stands for

295
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,320
expression qtls

296
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,320
and

297
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:44,559
we use the qtls in this the eqtls

298
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,320
in

299
00:11:44,559 --> 00:11:48,799
as as

300
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:52,399
additional tools to develop markers so

301
00:11:48,799 --> 00:11:54,559
we look for eqtls that are

302
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:56,958
whose apotype is in cis configuration

303
00:11:54,559 --> 00:11:59,439
with the trait that we're studying

304
00:11:56,958 --> 00:11:59,439
let it be

305
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:02,560
yield or

306
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:05,680
tree size or

307
00:12:02,559 --> 00:12:08,479
or disease resistance and then

308
00:12:05,679 --> 00:12:11,199
we find the polymorphism that is

309
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:12,399
contained in that in that gene and we

310
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,278
harness it

311
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:15,679
and

312
00:12:13,278 --> 00:12:16,799
this is a little slide to show you a

313
00:12:15,679 --> 00:12:18,879
little bit

314
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:22,000
what we're talking about so we have uh

315
00:12:18,879 --> 00:12:23,600
here um powdery mildew resistance uh

316
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,480
that's segregating in that population

317
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,920
and then

318
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,200
several uh

319
00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:30,000
genes that are

320
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:31,600
kind of associated with that uh

321
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,039
resistance in

322
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:36,000
in that region

323
00:12:33,039 --> 00:12:38,319
and then uh we take

324
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,639
we take those genes

325
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:43,440
and uh

326
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:45,919
essentially transform them

327
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:47,519
into markers

328
00:12:45,919 --> 00:12:50,479
that

329
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:51,600
are mapped we can we know where they are

330
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:53,839
and

331
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:56,399
they kind of look like

332
00:12:53,839 --> 00:13:00,079
this when we're done with it we

333
00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:01,839
we uh utilize any kind of of uh

334
00:13:00,078 --> 00:13:03,039
polymorphism that we can get our hands

335
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:05,360
on so

336
00:13:03,039 --> 00:13:07,519
snips or indels

337
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:10,320
endos are very nice

338
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:13,278
because you can create nice pcr primers

339
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:15,519
that amplify or not

340
00:13:13,278 --> 00:13:15,519
and

341
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,240
that has been very useful in our

342
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:22,240
breeding program and reducing the number

343
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:24,560
of plants that that has to go in the

344
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,560
field

345
00:13:26,159 --> 00:13:28,399
so

346
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:33,359
the question comes

347
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:35,919
to me then

348
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:37,360
we're developing these root stocks

349
00:13:35,919 --> 00:13:38,799
and

350
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:41,120
and

351
00:13:38,799 --> 00:13:44,078
they will eventually end up in the hands

352
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:46,399
of apple growers

353
00:13:44,078 --> 00:13:46,399
and

354
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:51,039
apple growers

355
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:52,159
or orchards are an interesting place

356
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:54,240
because

357
00:13:52,159 --> 00:13:56,000
well we have

358
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,440
interactions this is the roosters

359
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,559
interactions we have interactions with

360
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:02,800
the soil the ph type structure

361
00:14:00,559 --> 00:14:04,719
content the biology of the soil

362
00:14:02,799 --> 00:14:07,039
we have an interaction with cyan variety

363
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:09,600
that we deal with

364
00:14:07,039 --> 00:14:11,039
climate temperature amount of water

365
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,959
that's available

366
00:14:11,039 --> 00:14:15,360
diseases and insects

367
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:16,879
and then of course we have

368
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:19,278
i think perhaps the most important

369
00:14:16,879 --> 00:14:22,559
interaction which is with humans

370
00:14:19,278 --> 00:14:22,559
management and

371
00:14:23,278 --> 00:14:27,519
i can i can vouch for the fact that

372
00:14:26,078 --> 00:14:29,359
a rootstock

373
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:31,360
under different management is going to

374
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:33,039
react uh quite

375
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:34,399
quite differently and and produce a

376
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:36,240
different product

377
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:38,958
uh in the orchard so

378
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:41,440
it's it's uh it's tough for to breed for

379
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:42,838
orchard management but you know we can

380
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:46,079
try but

381
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:47,360
uh these interactions i

382
00:14:46,078 --> 00:14:49,278
were

383
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:52,000
hoping that uh

384
00:14:49,278 --> 00:14:54,240
our selection scheme is good enough to

385
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,399
be able to account for

386
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:58,959
uh the variability we see in in our root

387
00:14:56,399 --> 00:15:00,958
stocks and select for the best performer

388
00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:02,399
once

389
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:04,479
so

390
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:06,879
we go back to the to the basics what

391
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:10,000
does a root system do in the orchard

392
00:15:06,879 --> 00:15:12,320
where it modifies three architecture

393
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,320
we have an interface with the soil so

394
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:17,360
root penetration anchorage soil

395
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:19,360
chemistry ph salt microbes uh competes

396
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,879
with our roots so you have

397
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:24,240
that

398
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:26,320
as well it collects nutrients in water

399
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:29,600
that then it sends up to the to the

400
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:32,959
scion and uh and it fights infections

401
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:34,720
survives uh in in certain climates or

402
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:37,359
thrives in other climates

403
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:39,360
so uh whenever you improve rootstock

404
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:41,278
functions you end up improving the

405
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:44,240
productivity of the tree

406
00:15:41,278 --> 00:15:46,000
uh as well as i think

407
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:48,240
uh the quality of the apples that are

408
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,039
harvested from that tree

409
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:53,120
so

410
00:15:49,039 --> 00:15:53,120
and this this is more of a general

411
00:15:53,679 --> 00:15:58,159
thought that doesn't apply just to apple

412
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:00,879
roosex but it can apply to any other

413
00:15:58,159 --> 00:16:03,439
tree crop or vegetable crop that uses

414
00:16:00,879 --> 00:16:04,879
root stocks so there's a big push

415
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:08,240
or

416
00:16:04,879 --> 00:16:11,360
with tomatoes and roost stocks

417
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:13,198
and uh and other crops uh vegetable

418
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:16,320
crops that are using rootstock so all of

419
00:16:13,198 --> 00:16:18,879
these improving all these functions

420
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:20,240
through breeding can improve the overall

421
00:16:18,879 --> 00:16:22,078
yield

422
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:23,759
of the plant

423
00:16:22,078 --> 00:16:26,399
a few years back

424
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:28,159
we did a study with

425
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:30,639
apple rootstocks that

426
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:33,519
looked at how rootstocks were regulating

427
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:37,198
gene expression in the in the scion

428
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:38,799
or well we had the question do they

429
00:16:37,198 --> 00:16:41,599
regulate gene expression it makes sense

430
00:16:38,799 --> 00:16:42,559
that that that they that they do

431
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:46,000
and

432
00:16:42,559 --> 00:16:48,799
then what what does the rootstock modify

433
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,799
in the scion

434
00:16:49,278 --> 00:16:54,320
and we found out that that

435
00:16:51,919 --> 00:16:56,639
in effect uh dwarfing rootstocks had

436
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:58,959
different potentials to change

437
00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:04,078
the expression of certain genes

438
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:07,119
uh in the scion uh dramatically uh and

439
00:17:04,078 --> 00:17:08,639
that knowledge was was important because

440
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:10,078
well all right

441
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:12,160
um

442
00:17:10,078 --> 00:17:14,480
how

443
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:15,279
because it went back to how

444
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:18,400
the

445
00:17:15,279 --> 00:17:18,399
rootstocks may affect

446
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:23,599
the fruit

447
00:17:20,318 --> 00:17:26,639
and the production of food so

448
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:27,519
you have signals that go up and they may

449
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:30,000
be

450
00:17:27,519 --> 00:17:31,679
of many different types you know here

451
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,640
you have ethylene but

452
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:35,519
auxin types gibberellins

453
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:38,400
water

454
00:17:35,519 --> 00:17:40,798
water status is a big signal to

455
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:42,798
to the scion and then

456
00:17:40,798 --> 00:17:44,798
individual

457
00:17:42,798 --> 00:17:46,960
nutrients

458
00:17:44,798 --> 00:17:48,960
and there are more and more things that

459
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:53,519
that the russo or the root systems can

460
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:55,679
do to affect the the scion

461
00:17:53,519 --> 00:17:55,679
so

462
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:02,640
we decided that

463
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,320
um

464
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,120
we would look at

465
00:18:04,319 --> 00:18:06,639
some

466
00:18:05,119 --> 00:18:08,879
something that was

467
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:11,038
sort of easy to do

468
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,039
but

469
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:15,440
that would

470
00:18:12,798 --> 00:18:17,440
take one of the these elements and

471
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:19,360
specifically the changes in nutrient

472
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:21,759
availability

473
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:22,798
we wanted to look at what

474
00:18:21,759 --> 00:18:24,480
um

475
00:18:22,798 --> 00:18:25,679
what does if

476
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,599
number one

477
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:29,600
rootstocks had an effect

478
00:18:27,599 --> 00:18:30,798
or the uh

479
00:18:29,599 --> 00:18:33,279
different

480
00:18:30,798 --> 00:18:36,960
uh germplasm had an effect on the same

481
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:39,119
scion of uh to see if it could it would

482
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:40,319
modify the concentration of certain

483
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:41,199
nutrients

484
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:43,200
in

485
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,640
in the scion

486
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,240
and uh

487
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:48,880
um

488
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:52,798
also we want to look at how these root

489
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:56,960
stocks performed in different uh uh

490
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:59,279
solar conditions so ph water soil borne

491
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:01,038
diseases and soil type

492
00:18:59,279 --> 00:19:03,038
we also

493
00:19:01,038 --> 00:19:05,359
wanted to see i wanted to see if i could

494
00:19:03,038 --> 00:19:07,279
mitigate food disorders that are caused

495
00:19:05,359 --> 00:19:10,558
sometimes by

496
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:13,119
the lack of or the overabundance of

497
00:19:10,558 --> 00:19:14,160
certain nutrients in the in the fruit

498
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:16,000
so

499
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:18,720
cal there is a very strong correlation

500
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,640
between calcium and bitter pit

501
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:22,839
and honey crisp and other apples that

502
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:26,240
develop bitter pit

503
00:19:22,839 --> 00:19:28,079
so for from a breeding standpoint

504
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:29,759
the question was can i

505
00:19:28,079 --> 00:19:31,839
select for

506
00:19:29,759 --> 00:19:35,200
increase calcium availability to the

507
00:19:31,839 --> 00:19:38,639
cyan so that we mitigate that problem

508
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:40,000
uh in that appears in storage facilities

509
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:42,240
around the

510
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,919
u.s and around the world

511
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:47,279
and

512
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:49,520
as lastly the possibility to improve on

513
00:19:47,279 --> 00:19:51,038
fertilizer applications what if we could

514
00:19:49,519 --> 00:19:54,079
apply

515
00:19:51,038 --> 00:19:57,200
percent less phosphorus or nitrogen

516
00:19:54,079 --> 00:19:58,480
to to the same planting maintaining the

517
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,519
same yield

518
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,400
uh

519
00:19:59,519 --> 00:20:03,038
in

520
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:04,080
in the orchard

521
00:20:03,038 --> 00:20:06,798
how would

522
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:08,319
can we can we do that and

523
00:20:06,798 --> 00:20:12,240
so uh

524
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:12,240
you know this is going back to to

525
00:20:12,558 --> 00:20:16,158
biology or root biology

526
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,960
we

527
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:21,679
said okay how are we gonna how are we

528
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:22,480
going to study this and uh of course we

529
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:24,559
in

530
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:26,000
apple roostock's

531
00:20:24,558 --> 00:20:27,839
it makes sense that they they may

532
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:31,519
possess different uh

533
00:20:27,839 --> 00:20:32,839
uh channels for for different nutrients

534
00:20:31,519 --> 00:20:36,558
um

535
00:20:32,839 --> 00:20:38,319
and here it goes into the roots uh

536
00:20:36,558 --> 00:20:40,480
this is the root hair and and then the

537
00:20:38,319 --> 00:20:42,720
nutrients go back up and you have the

538
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:44,640
same cyan and into the apples so you

539
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:47,440
have

540
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:49,360
so many things going on

541
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:52,798
that influence

542
00:20:49,359 --> 00:20:57,119
that and i was talking uh

543
00:20:52,798 --> 00:20:59,519
uh earlier and mentioning that okay

544
00:20:57,119 --> 00:21:01,839
when you have a system that is so

545
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:03,679
complex

546
00:21:01,839 --> 00:21:04,959
kind of had to use the black box

547
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:06,880
approach

548
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:08,720
which is

549
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:11,440
to

550
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:13,279
find out what happens at the

551
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,558
at the end of the

552
00:21:13,279 --> 00:21:17,519
at the end of the tunnel at the end of

553
00:21:14,558 --> 00:21:19,119
the process so

554
00:21:17,519 --> 00:21:22,319
all of the

555
00:21:19,119 --> 00:21:23,759
experiments that i'm going to show

556
00:21:22,319 --> 00:21:26,558
the results i'm going to show in the

557
00:21:23,759 --> 00:21:26,558
next few minutes

558
00:21:26,798 --> 00:21:30,119
have a similarity

559
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:36,000
they're all grown on the same media or

560
00:21:32,798 --> 00:21:37,759
treatments media treatments

561
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,038
and then they have we have different

562
00:21:37,759 --> 00:21:41,359
root stocks

563
00:21:39,038 --> 00:21:42,798
that that we're looking at so we have a

564
00:21:41,359 --> 00:21:45,119
diversity whether

565
00:21:42,798 --> 00:21:46,639
it is a diversity panel of rootstocks or

566
00:21:45,119 --> 00:21:49,359
whether it's a structured population

567
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:50,640
where we can do some genetics

568
00:21:49,359 --> 00:21:52,719
and

569
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:56,000
and then they all have the same cyan

570
00:21:52,720 --> 00:22:00,240
grafted on it so that we can

571
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:01,119
kind of separate perhaps the effect of

572
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:03,200
of

573
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:04,719
individual scion properties that the

574
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:06,319
rootstocks may have

575
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:07,759
so

576
00:22:06,319 --> 00:22:09,599
it's a good system and we measure

577
00:22:07,759 --> 00:22:13,119
everything

578
00:22:09,599 --> 00:22:13,839
on the on the common sign

579
00:22:13,119 --> 00:22:16,239
so

580
00:22:13,839 --> 00:22:18,399
way back then we devised

581
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:22,079
in collaboration with

582
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:24,880
dr robinson and and uh

583
00:22:22,079 --> 00:22:26,720
dr craiglist who was a visiting

584
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,960
scientist from lithuania

585
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:31,200
we designed

586
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:32,798
a few experiments

587
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,480
one that would

588
00:22:32,798 --> 00:22:36,879
look at ph

589
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:38,319
effects on apple root stocks the other

590
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:40,400
one that would look at

591
00:22:38,319 --> 00:22:42,720
apple replant disease and

592
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:44,159
and different uh

593
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:45,360
soil types

594
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:47,039
and then

595
00:22:45,359 --> 00:22:49,839
another one that

596
00:22:47,038 --> 00:22:51,200
uh investigated the genetics of soil of

597
00:22:49,839 --> 00:22:55,038
tree nutrition

598
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:57,919
and the actual and rude architecture

599
00:22:55,038 --> 00:22:57,919
so um

600
00:22:58,319 --> 00:23:03,119
and we published uh some of the results

601
00:23:01,038 --> 00:23:04,879
from uh from these studies this is what

602
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:07,119
uh the experiments looked like this is

603
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:09,840
darius quickly who did

604
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:09,839
most of the

605
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:14,080
real hard work

606
00:23:11,839 --> 00:23:17,359
here is looking at root systems and

607
00:23:14,079 --> 00:23:20,879
washing them and and categorizing them

608
00:23:17,359 --> 00:23:23,038
but these plants were grown in

609
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:24,159
randomized uh

610
00:23:23,038 --> 00:23:25,519
system

611
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:28,480
and uh

612
00:23:25,519 --> 00:23:31,839
in in these pots these were the original

613
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:31,839
plants before they were budded

614
00:23:32,798 --> 00:23:38,000
and as you can see what a field of them

615
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:40,480
looks like and they're all individually

616
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,319
further irrigated

617
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:44,240
or

618
00:23:42,319 --> 00:23:46,720
hand

619
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:48,400
hand fertilized

620
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:50,960
depending on the experiment this is

621
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:52,320
there were many different experiments so

622
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:55,038
um

623
00:23:52,319 --> 00:23:57,439
the first experiment that uh

624
00:23:55,038 --> 00:23:59,038
i'd like to talk about

625
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,558
is where we have two different soil

626
00:23:59,038 --> 00:24:02,558
types and

627
00:24:00,558 --> 00:24:03,519
sandy loam and clayroam from replant

628
00:24:02,558 --> 00:24:06,399
soils

629
00:24:03,519 --> 00:24:06,400
in new york state

630
00:24:07,038 --> 00:24:11,200
two different treatments within the soil

631
00:24:08,798 --> 00:24:13,440
steam pasteurized and unpasteurized

632
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,440
and

633
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:16,880
what we found was

634
00:24:15,519 --> 00:24:19,119
that

635
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:21,120
both the soil and

636
00:24:19,119 --> 00:24:22,319
the um

637
00:24:21,119 --> 00:24:24,798
the treatment

638
00:24:22,319 --> 00:24:28,960
had an effect on nutrient concentrations

639
00:24:24,798 --> 00:24:30,319
in the in the leaves we harvested the

640
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:32,880
five

641
00:24:30,319 --> 00:24:36,480
leaves from each replica and and so now

642
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:38,720
you're looking at at the at the means

643
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:39,519
it's interesting that

644
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:41,519
the

645
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:42,720
pasteurization treatment had an effect

646
00:24:41,519 --> 00:24:44,879
on uh

647
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:47,679
final three heights of

648
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:50,799
most plants

649
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:53,278
but we and then we find

650
00:24:50,798 --> 00:24:55,759
nutrients like iron

651
00:24:53,278 --> 00:24:56,798
and molybdenum

652
00:24:55,759 --> 00:24:58,879
kind of

653
00:24:56,798 --> 00:25:00,798
being

654
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:02,000
connected somehow

655
00:25:00,798 --> 00:25:04,158
to

656
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,519
the the tree height so how well the

657
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:08,320
plant grew

658
00:25:05,519 --> 00:25:09,599
uh and to the pasteurization treatment

659
00:25:08,319 --> 00:25:10,879
and then

660
00:25:09,599 --> 00:25:13,199
other

661
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:16,320
elements that were

662
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:17,919
dependent more on on the type of soil

663
00:25:16,319 --> 00:25:19,918
uh than uh

664
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:22,320
than the pasteurization treatment so for

665
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:24,960
example potassium it was one of the

666
00:25:22,319 --> 00:25:26,639
those where in sandy soils

667
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:28,640
uh you would there was a more

668
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:31,440
concentration of potassium in the leaves

669
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:32,480
than in not

670
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:35,600
and

671
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:36,558
these were i don't know if i

672
00:25:35,599 --> 00:25:39,599
they were

673
00:25:36,558 --> 00:25:41,839
38 different root stocks representing

674
00:25:39,599 --> 00:25:43,519
pretty much genetic diversity the

675
00:25:41,839 --> 00:25:46,079
worldwide genetic diversity of apple

676
00:25:43,519 --> 00:25:46,079
root stocks

677
00:25:47,278 --> 00:25:52,000
and after that so you can take

678
00:25:50,079 --> 00:25:54,879
all of that data and you can group root

679
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:57,919
stocks by their nutrient concentrations

680
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:58,720
and you get a graph that looks like this

681
00:25:57,919 --> 00:25:59,600
where

682
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:02,640
some

683
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:05,038
are in more in the higher range and

684
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:08,320
others are really really in the low

685
00:26:05,038 --> 00:26:10,240
range this is in the sandy soil

686
00:26:08,319 --> 00:26:12,480
the picture looks a little bit different

687
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:14,480
in clay soil so here's another

688
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:16,000
complexity that

689
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:19,360
i didn't want to have to work with but

690
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:22,319
guess what it's there so somehow it has

691
00:26:19,359 --> 00:26:22,319
to it has to

692
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:27,600
uh be incorporated into the knowledge

693
00:26:26,558 --> 00:26:28,879
base

694
00:26:27,599 --> 00:26:30,558
to develop

695
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:32,960
new root stocks

696
00:26:30,558 --> 00:26:35,200
perhaps the answer is going

697
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:36,880
to be to

698
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:38,640
sometime in the future to be able to

699
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:41,200
develop something that is

700
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:43,038
adapted to to uh

701
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:44,558
most in most soil types in most

702
00:26:43,038 --> 00:26:45,440
environments

703
00:26:44,558 --> 00:26:48,158
but

704
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:52,000
my guess is that if you want to really

705
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:55,520
crank uh apples from

706
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:57,119
different a certain soil type then

707
00:26:55,519 --> 00:26:59,440
perhaps you can select that you can

708
00:26:57,119 --> 00:27:00,639
maximize

709
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:03,600
that

710
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:03,600
that opportunity

711
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,839
using germplasm that we already have

712
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:12,880
another complexity um

713
00:27:11,119 --> 00:27:13,918
ph

714
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:15,360
so

715
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:18,240
we

716
00:27:15,359 --> 00:27:20,479
had 33 different root stocks on and

717
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:22,640
treated the cornell mix

718
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:26,640
adjusted to different ph

719
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:28,080
ranging from 4.5 to 8.5 and

720
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:30,720
and

721
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:32,798
looked at what the effect was

722
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:34,798
of ph in general

723
00:27:32,798 --> 00:27:36,960
on onto

724
00:27:34,798 --> 00:27:38,798
all these different root stocks and some

725
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:41,038
what's interesting is that some

726
00:27:38,798 --> 00:27:42,398
rootstocks

727
00:27:41,038 --> 00:27:43,839
here's the

728
00:27:42,398 --> 00:27:45,278
phosphorus

729
00:27:43,839 --> 00:27:48,879
the

730
00:27:45,278 --> 00:27:51,519
phosphorus concentration in leaves uh

731
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:52,399
the root sauce were quite different in

732
00:27:51,519 --> 00:27:55,038
their

733
00:27:52,398 --> 00:27:58,879
curves their individual curves there is

734
00:27:55,038 --> 00:27:58,879
there was a significant um

735
00:27:59,119 --> 00:28:03,278
nutrient concentration by roostock

736
00:28:01,599 --> 00:28:05,439
interaction

737
00:28:03,278 --> 00:28:07,519
and well actually roose talks about ph

738
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:09,759
interaction

739
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:09,759
so

740
00:28:10,398 --> 00:28:14,158
so that

741
00:28:11,759 --> 00:28:16,398
this this becomes yet another thing that

742
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:19,278
you have to worry about when when

743
00:28:16,398 --> 00:28:21,119
releasing uh apple resource because some

744
00:28:19,278 --> 00:28:23,200
some proof stocks that may be well

745
00:28:21,119 --> 00:28:24,398
adapted here in

746
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:26,798
low ph

747
00:28:24,398 --> 00:28:26,798
soils

748
00:28:27,278 --> 00:28:31,038
typical of new york state may not work

749
00:28:29,278 --> 00:28:32,880
as well in

750
00:28:31,038 --> 00:28:36,640
the rocky mountains or other places

751
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:36,640
where the ph is a little bit higher

752
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:42,240
and here is the

753
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:43,440
molybdenum for example

754
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,399
which

755
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:46,880
it shows

756
00:28:44,398 --> 00:28:49,439
that the the ph treatment worked because

757
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:52,080
of the shape of the curve

758
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:53,038
overall so

759
00:28:52,079 --> 00:28:56,158
um

760
00:28:53,038 --> 00:29:00,158
we found also in in the in all of these

761
00:28:56,159 --> 00:29:03,039
data some relationships between

762
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:04,320
nutrients that were

763
00:29:03,038 --> 00:29:07,038
generalized

764
00:29:04,319 --> 00:29:09,918
in among all root stocks so this is a

765
00:29:07,038 --> 00:29:11,599
relationship that between copper and

766
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:13,600
phosphorus

767
00:29:11,599 --> 00:29:15,519
it's pretty strong and it doesn't change

768
00:29:13,599 --> 00:29:18,158
very much by

769
00:29:15,519 --> 00:29:19,359
the ph

770
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:23,919
and

771
00:29:19,359 --> 00:29:26,398
i could show you maybe 50 different

772
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:29,520
more grafts like this and and not all of

773
00:29:26,398 --> 00:29:31,359
them are are like this some do change

774
00:29:29,519 --> 00:29:33,200
but i just wanted to

775
00:29:31,359 --> 00:29:34,719
uh mention that

776
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:38,319
um

777
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:41,759
this is the overall picture of of the uh

778
00:29:38,319 --> 00:29:44,558
of the relationships uh between the ph

779
00:29:41,759 --> 00:29:44,558
and and

780
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:48,720
actually these are all the phs put

781
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:49,759
together

782
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:51,519
and

783
00:29:49,759 --> 00:29:52,879
represents the whole data set and you

784
00:29:51,519 --> 00:29:55,759
can see that some relationships for

785
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:58,320
example between calcium and magnesium

786
00:29:55,759 --> 00:29:59,759
are still very significant or

787
00:29:58,319 --> 00:30:01,119
here you have

788
00:29:59,759 --> 00:30:03,440
the one that i showed you earlier

789
00:30:01,119 --> 00:30:04,879
between phosphorus and copper and so on

790
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:08,159
and so forth so

791
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:08,159
and all of these

792
00:30:08,398 --> 00:30:13,839
all of these relationships

793
00:30:10,398 --> 00:30:15,759
they tend to affect the final growth of

794
00:30:13,839 --> 00:30:16,879
of the plant

795
00:30:15,759 --> 00:30:18,558
okay

796
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:21,278
so uh

797
00:30:18,558 --> 00:30:24,000
here's another complexity

798
00:30:21,278 --> 00:30:27,839
and uh when you look at at an individual

799
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:31,679
ph uh treatment you can classify

800
00:30:27,839 --> 00:30:33,839
uh certain root stocks or or kind of uh

801
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:36,798
group them together according to

802
00:30:33,839 --> 00:30:38,720
what they what they like or

803
00:30:36,798 --> 00:30:41,839
or their similarity

804
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:41,839
based on on

805
00:30:43,119 --> 00:30:48,158
nutrient concentration

806
00:30:45,839 --> 00:30:48,158
okay

807
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:52,559
one more experiment

808
00:30:51,278 --> 00:30:55,200
uh and this

809
00:30:52,558 --> 00:30:56,720
dealt with the genetics

810
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:59,840
so you have

811
00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:01,679
uh so i i show you now the wider

812
00:30:59,839 --> 00:31:04,639
germplasm

813
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:06,159
and now we're going into a segregating

814
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:09,440
population

815
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:12,480
we had three replicas grafted with gala

816
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:12,480
apples and

817
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:19,839
and we're now we're looking at the

818
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:21,440
qtls or qtl analysis of

819
00:31:19,839 --> 00:31:24,158
this this is

820
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:24,159
the overall

821
00:31:24,319 --> 00:31:27,918
status or

822
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:30,480
relationship of the

823
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:33,519
of the nutrients

824
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:36,720
within this data set and

825
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:40,000
the relationships that we saw earlier

826
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:42,399
with the ph and replant um

827
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:44,398
some of them kind of disappear but these

828
00:31:42,398 --> 00:31:46,798
basically represent

829
00:31:44,398 --> 00:31:48,798
uh the segregation of genes

830
00:31:46,798 --> 00:31:50,639
okay this is the variability that's

831
00:31:48,798 --> 00:31:54,639
caused by the segregation of genes we're

832
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:55,840
looking at in individual genotypic means

833
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:59,679
here

834
00:31:55,839 --> 00:32:00,639
so um there are some things that that

835
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:02,880
are

836
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:04,799
very well connected

837
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:07,440
and they may share

838
00:32:04,798 --> 00:32:10,000
the same mechanisms

839
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:10,000
and you can

840
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:16,640
summarize those relationships

841
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:16,640
by looking at

842
00:32:17,278 --> 00:32:21,200
in this way so

843
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:24,399
magnesium and calcium

844
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:27,200
they seem to have very very tight

845
00:32:24,398 --> 00:32:28,879
a very tight relationship that's

846
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:30,720
very pretty well known in the in the

847
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:32,480
literature

848
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:35,600
in this case phosphorus and and

849
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:37,519
potassium also share quite a bit zinc

850
00:32:35,599 --> 00:32:39,278
and copper

851
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:41,599
and then the other interesting

852
00:32:39,278 --> 00:32:44,319
relationship was

853
00:32:41,599 --> 00:32:45,439
sulfur and manganese and what you see

854
00:32:44,319 --> 00:32:48,319
right here

855
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:50,558
sodium was which is a

856
00:32:48,319 --> 00:32:53,519
it's it's a it's absorbed

857
00:32:50,558 --> 00:32:56,240
in i think in a very different way than

858
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:58,480
than most of these

859
00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:01,278
nutrients

860
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:05,839
is is the out group or

861
00:33:01,278 --> 00:33:05,839
represents a very different beast

862
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:11,839
so

863
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:13,919
take all that data and you connect it to

864
00:33:11,839 --> 00:33:15,519
the to the genotypes

865
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:17,440
segregation uh

866
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:20,480
mendel's laws and and so on and so forth

867
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:23,038
and compare uh means and

868
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:26,558
uh of uh plants that have

869
00:33:23,038 --> 00:33:29,679
one allele a locus versus another allele

870
00:33:26,558 --> 00:33:31,599
and what we found was that

871
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:32,399
we could

872
00:33:31,599 --> 00:33:35,439
find

873
00:33:32,398 --> 00:33:38,079
significant effects caused by

874
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:40,880
by the segregation of alleles here this

875
00:33:38,079 --> 00:33:44,398
is on chromosome 5

876
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:45,360
for potassium concentration in leaves

877
00:33:44,398 --> 00:33:48,158
and

878
00:33:45,359 --> 00:33:50,398
what's interesting here is uh

879
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:52,720
the dwarfing locus 1 is here but it's

880
00:33:50,398 --> 00:33:57,038
not connected to to

881
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:59,440
to nutrient to potassium nutrition

882
00:33:57,038 --> 00:34:01,759
because we have recombinants that that

883
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:02,880
show that

884
00:34:01,759 --> 00:34:05,038
but

885
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:09,358
and then my question to you the audience

886
00:34:05,038 --> 00:34:11,358
maybe you can you can tell me what uh

887
00:34:09,358 --> 00:34:12,960
going from

888
00:34:11,358 --> 00:34:14,239
16

889
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:17,199
uh

890
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:20,479
milligrams per gram of potassium

891
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:22,158
concentration leaves to 28 milligrams

892
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:23,358
per gram that's the

893
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:25,440
range

894
00:34:23,358 --> 00:34:27,759
what does that mean to the whole plant

895
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:30,639
or the whole tree

896
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:33,599
to the fruit

897
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:34,878
so i'm still trying to figure that out

898
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:38,240
and if you have

899
00:34:34,878 --> 00:34:40,960
illuminated thoughts i would mostly

900
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:43,759
welcome them but here right here you can

901
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:45,519
break down the segregation of the

902
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:49,040
individual alleles and you can see that

903
00:34:45,519 --> 00:34:51,039
there is a lower alleles

904
00:34:49,039 --> 00:34:53,599
combination and a higher one and then

905
00:34:51,039 --> 00:34:55,599
two middle ones

906
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:56,639
good we did the same thing for for

907
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:58,079
sodium

908
00:34:56,639 --> 00:35:00,320
and we found a major effect on

909
00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:01,359
chromosome 17 this this

910
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:02,960
seems to

911
00:35:01,358 --> 00:35:05,199
uh it's

912
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:06,240
fairly close to

913
00:35:05,199 --> 00:35:11,118
the

914
00:35:06,239 --> 00:35:11,118
s locust but far enough to not be it

915
00:35:11,519 --> 00:35:15,199
and

916
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:16,640
again we have

917
00:35:15,199 --> 00:35:17,598
uh

918
00:35:16,639 --> 00:35:19,199
almost

919
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:21,280
a doubling

920
00:35:19,199 --> 00:35:24,319
of the uh

921
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:26,160
amount of sodium in into into the leaves

922
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:28,160
so what does that mean to the to the

923
00:35:26,159 --> 00:35:31,118
tree or to the fruit

924
00:35:28,159 --> 00:35:34,319
and that's what we're trying to find out

925
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:37,440
we can find copper qtls that are that

926
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:38,880
increase or decrease copper in in in the

927
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:40,079
plants

928
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:41,838
iron

929
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:43,359
and finally the picture looks a little

930
00:35:41,838 --> 00:35:46,799
bit like this

931
00:35:43,358 --> 00:35:50,319
which is very complex and so

932
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:51,760
it's kind of a little bit maddening

933
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:53,920
people have seen me

934
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:55,440
walk by my office and i've got four

935
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:56,800
screens and i've got

936
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:58,639
this and i'm trying to understand what

937
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:01,280
the relationship between this and this

938
00:35:58,639 --> 00:36:01,279
locus is

939
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:07,680
so more data is needed

940
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:11,119
but

941
00:36:07,679 --> 00:36:13,358
the long i think the message here

942
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:15,358
is is that

943
00:36:13,358 --> 00:36:17,199
we have genetic variation that we can

944
00:36:15,358 --> 00:36:19,838
harness

945
00:36:17,199 --> 00:36:21,118
if we want to target certain uh nutrient

946
00:36:19,838 --> 00:36:24,159
concentrations

947
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:27,280
so and and and it's plenty it's there

948
00:36:24,159 --> 00:36:29,039
uh and and it's heritable

949
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:31,760
another complication

950
00:36:29,039 --> 00:36:33,039
so how how does nutrient concentration

951
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:35,119
relate to this

952
00:36:33,039 --> 00:36:37,119
uh this is a

953
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:39,680
a

954
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:41,680
type of root morphology that is also

955
00:36:39,679 --> 00:36:43,118
segregating in that same population that

956
00:36:41,679 --> 00:36:45,039
we were studying

957
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:48,000
and

958
00:36:45,039 --> 00:36:51,119
it doesn't we have like minor qtls

959
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:54,079
perhaps uh that that show up in on

960
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:56,000
linkage four but not much on on well a

961
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:59,440
little bit on 11.

962
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:00,880
so uh but we mapped the the uh

963
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:03,358
this uh

964
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:04,800
this morphology change

965
00:37:03,358 --> 00:37:06,880
and uh

966
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:10,000
a lot of the effects are somewhat

967
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:14,000
independent of our morphology meaning

968
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:16,159
that this perhaps sits somewhere

969
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,280
in a different realm

970
00:37:16,159 --> 00:37:19,199
of

971
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:21,119
nutrition

972
00:37:19,199 --> 00:37:24,639
but

973
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:27,200
that root morphology is so important

974
00:37:24,639 --> 00:37:29,920
because it shows up in

975
00:37:27,199 --> 00:37:31,519
about 80 percent of our released root

976
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:34,400
stocks

977
00:37:31,519 --> 00:37:36,880
so this is a typical nine

978
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:40,639
root system it doesn't branch out very

979
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:43,599
much and this is a g41 g935 here's

980
00:37:40,639 --> 00:37:47,039
another one in that population g214

981
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:50,559
and uh and so

982
00:37:47,039 --> 00:37:53,358
we find that that somehow this was

983
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:55,440
selected based on yield efficiency this

984
00:37:53,358 --> 00:37:57,679
this this morphology

985
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,679
so

986
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:02,560
does this affect the

987
00:38:00,719 --> 00:38:04,719
the way

988
00:38:02,559 --> 00:38:07,358
fruit is produced

989
00:38:04,719 --> 00:38:08,799
yeah it does um

990
00:38:07,358 --> 00:38:11,199
it

991
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:13,200
how much how important is it well we're

992
00:38:11,199 --> 00:38:17,039
still in the process of of evaluating

993
00:38:13,199 --> 00:38:18,559
the importance of of that

994
00:38:17,039 --> 00:38:21,039
um

995
00:38:18,559 --> 00:38:23,920
so when you see a segregating population

996
00:38:21,039 --> 00:38:26,960
when you look at at uh at

997
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:28,559
the concentration of of uh

998
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:31,358
calcium potassium magnesium and

999
00:38:28,559 --> 00:38:32,559
phosphorus and trying uh try to group

1000
00:38:31,358 --> 00:38:34,239
and

1001
00:38:32,559 --> 00:38:37,599
find out different groups you can do

1002
00:38:34,239 --> 00:38:40,000
that and you can find

1003
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:40,000
perhaps

1004
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:45,679
rootstocks that have

1005
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:47,838
similarities just based on the alleles

1006
00:38:45,679 --> 00:38:51,118
that they inherited

1007
00:38:47,838 --> 00:38:54,480
from from the from the two parents and

1008
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:58,079
you can separate them and perhaps if you

1009
00:38:54,480 --> 00:39:01,358
here add the yield yield efficiency and

1010
00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:03,359
a few more columns you can begin to find

1011
00:39:01,358 --> 00:39:05,759
which rootstock has

1012
00:39:03,358 --> 00:39:07,279
some of these properties that that we're

1013
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:09,040
looking for

1014
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:10,079
um

1015
00:39:09,039 --> 00:39:12,159
so

1016
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:15,039
right now i've mostly

1017
00:39:12,159 --> 00:39:17,118
spoken about um

1018
00:39:15,039 --> 00:39:20,000
leaves we were looking at

1019
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:22,240
leaves in a scion but

1020
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,119
heck you don't taste leaves do you well

1021
00:39:22,239 --> 00:39:26,319
some

1022
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:26,320
i know some people do but

1023
00:39:26,838 --> 00:39:33,279
so uh what about fruit

1024
00:39:30,639 --> 00:39:34,879
and and so the next uh

1025
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:37,599
iteration for for this set of

1026
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:40,160
experiments was to look at fruit

1027
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:42,400
and we wanted i wanted to be bold i said

1028
00:39:40,159 --> 00:39:45,358
oh you know we have the same population

1029
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:47,440
now let's move on we have it in in the

1030
00:39:45,358 --> 00:39:49,519
field and let's look at what happens in

1031
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:51,440
the field so this is a field in loomis

1032
00:39:49,519 --> 00:39:54,400
and it's it's fairly the the soil is

1033
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:56,639
fairly unif uniform it's a silt loam

1034
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:59,760
so we have the same population that we

1035
00:39:56,639 --> 00:40:01,199
were studying in in in these buckets

1036
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:02,720
and uh

1037
00:40:01,199 --> 00:40:04,799
um

1038
00:40:02,719 --> 00:40:07,439
grafted with gala again

1039
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:11,640
and it's replicated and we collected the

1040
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:11,639
fruit and leaves for mineral analysis

1041
00:40:11,679 --> 00:40:17,679
i have to thank sarah bauer and and

1042
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:19,760
and todd holleran for working very hard

1043
00:40:17,679 --> 00:40:21,679
to

1044
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:23,440
with this experiment our technician

1045
00:40:21,679 --> 00:40:26,559
because they they work long hours

1046
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:27,440
preparing the material for analysis

1047
00:40:26,559 --> 00:40:29,039
um

1048
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:30,880
but

1049
00:40:29,039 --> 00:40:33,199
when when we look at fruit

1050
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:34,000
concentrations okay so so we here we

1051
00:40:33,199 --> 00:40:37,118
look

1052
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:39,440
in this orchard we looked at leaf

1053
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:41,838
as well as fruit from the same tree the

1054
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:43,200
fruit was collected prior to maturity so

1055
00:40:41,838 --> 00:40:45,679
we wanted to have

1056
00:40:43,199 --> 00:40:49,358
uh we want we didn't want to collect

1057
00:40:45,679 --> 00:40:51,759
things based on different maturities

1058
00:40:49,358 --> 00:40:53,759
and and we collected uh

1059
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:55,680
five mature

1060
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:57,119
leaves from different parts of the tree

1061
00:40:55,679 --> 00:41:00,399
so this is

1062
00:40:57,119 --> 00:41:02,480
these are overall mean genotypic means

1063
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:03,920
that that we're looking at

1064
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:07,199
and

1065
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:08,960
what we see is that we have maintained

1066
00:41:07,199 --> 00:41:11,919
some relationships

1067
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:13,358
uh for example this is phosphorus and

1068
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:15,119
and potassium

1069
00:41:13,358 --> 00:41:17,199
uh improves phosphorus and food

1070
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:19,599
potassium they they are in this box

1071
00:41:17,199 --> 00:41:22,480
right here so those relationships are

1072
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:24,559
still pretty strong then there are

1073
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:25,519
negative relationships

1074
00:41:24,559 --> 00:41:27,039
and

1075
00:41:25,519 --> 00:41:30,400
so you have leap magnesium and

1076
00:41:27,039 --> 00:41:32,719
fruit-borne that needs seem to be

1077
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:34,800
inversely

1078
00:41:32,719 --> 00:41:37,439
related to to uh

1079
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:39,519
uh these nutrients and we find a lot of

1080
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:41,679
relationships now

1081
00:41:39,519 --> 00:41:43,280
mind you this this right here this

1082
00:41:41,679 --> 00:41:45,440
diversity or this

1083
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:48,960
uh

1084
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:50,318
is is uh

1085
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:52,000
genotypic

1086
00:41:50,318 --> 00:41:54,239
so it's segregation of genes that's

1087
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,838
causing this it's it's and of course

1088
00:41:54,239 --> 00:41:57,279
there is a little bit of air built into

1089
00:41:55,838 --> 00:41:59,119
it or

1090
00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:03,200
more more than an air that's that's why

1091
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:06,720
it's not perfect but um

1092
00:42:03,199 --> 00:42:08,239
so we're able to perhaps select material

1093
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:10,799
uh and this is the first time that we

1094
00:42:08,239 --> 00:42:12,639
looked at nitrogen in

1095
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:16,079
both in food and leaves and we found

1096
00:42:12,639 --> 00:42:18,318
this interesting relationship between

1097
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:19,440
three diameter

1098
00:42:18,318 --> 00:42:21,519
fruit

1099
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:23,119
sulfur concentration of food nitrogen

1100
00:42:21,519 --> 00:42:24,480
concentration so

1101
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:26,960
as the

1102
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:28,000
trees were got bigger

1103
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:30,800
we had

1104
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:32,960
less nitrogen concentration in fruits

1105
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:35,039
that makes sense and less sulfur

1106
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:37,760
now i have no idea why sulfur and

1107
00:42:35,039 --> 00:42:38,719
nitrogen are are behaving in a similar

1108
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:40,880
manner

1109
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:42,078
perhaps some of you can can explain that

1110
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:45,200
to me

1111
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:47,359
but remember that that qtl that big qtl

1112
00:42:45,199 --> 00:42:48,639
that we found in

1113
00:42:47,358 --> 00:42:51,920
in leaves

1114
00:42:48,639 --> 00:42:54,239
of uh in potted plants in almost the

1115
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:57,119
perfect environment that we could it's

1116
00:42:54,239 --> 00:43:00,239
not perfect it's not as perfect as as

1117
00:42:57,119 --> 00:43:00,240
uh as as your

1118
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:06,559
the hydroponics that you do

1119
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:07,358
but

1120
00:43:06,559 --> 00:43:09,759
um

1121
00:43:07,358 --> 00:43:10,719
so remember that qtl for for potassium

1122
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:11,520
well

1123
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:12,959
we

1124
00:43:11,519 --> 00:43:17,679
found it in

1125
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:17,679
the in the field okay we were able to

1126
00:43:18,239 --> 00:43:22,639
find it in the field and there it is

1127
00:43:20,719 --> 00:43:24,639
in the leaves

1128
00:43:22,639 --> 00:43:25,679
but guess what happens in the fruit it's

1129
00:43:24,639 --> 00:43:27,679
gone

1130
00:43:25,679 --> 00:43:29,279
so

1131
00:43:27,679 --> 00:43:30,399
i don't know why

1132
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:32,640
uh

1133
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:35,119
but you can see that in the fruit this

1134
00:43:32,639 --> 00:43:38,639
is uh the uh

1135
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:41,039
uh i think the blue are the leaves uh

1136
00:43:38,639 --> 00:43:43,440
right here and the uh

1137
00:43:41,039 --> 00:43:45,519
radar is the fruit there is very little

1138
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:49,440
variation that's caused

1139
00:43:45,519 --> 00:43:52,480
by the alleles at this at the

1140
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:55,519
potassium locus that now because we know

1141
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:57,039
what gene it is we're able to mark and

1142
00:43:55,519 --> 00:43:58,719
and figure it out

1143
00:43:57,039 --> 00:43:59,920
and there is a little bit of variation

1144
00:43:58,719 --> 00:44:01,439
but it's still detectable and

1145
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:04,079
significant

1146
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:04,079
based on

1147
00:44:04,239 --> 00:44:08,959
on on the leaves

1148
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:12,160
uh and yet

1149
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:14,559
fruit uh potassium and fruit and leaf

1150
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:17,358
potassium are

1151
00:44:14,559 --> 00:44:19,440
highly correlated so

1152
00:44:17,358 --> 00:44:21,759
i'm scratching my head there's there's

1153
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:24,240
something else that's going on here

1154
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:26,480
we do have another qtl for fruit

1155
00:44:24,239 --> 00:44:28,959
potassium concentration it's not located

1156
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:31,119
here somewhere else in the genome

1157
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:34,800
and that's a story that

1158
00:44:31,119 --> 00:44:34,800
will come later but but

1159
00:44:34,838 --> 00:44:38,480
um how does

1160
00:44:38,639 --> 00:44:43,679
so we and and now we're beginning to

1161
00:44:40,639 --> 00:44:46,559
connect last year we took uh

1162
00:44:43,679 --> 00:44:47,519
fruit some very rudimental fruit quality

1163
00:44:46,559 --> 00:44:49,679
data

1164
00:44:47,519 --> 00:44:50,880
simple one is was

1165
00:44:49,679 --> 00:44:53,759
bricks

1166
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:56,000
and the pressure the mean fruit pressure

1167
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:58,800
based on i think 20 fruit

1168
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:00,639
uh collected from uh

1169
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:02,160
each individual t tree in that

1170
00:45:00,639 --> 00:45:04,960
population

1171
00:45:02,159 --> 00:45:08,239
and uh and now we're just looking at uh

1172
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:10,240
trunk diameter and and how those those

1173
00:45:08,239 --> 00:45:13,838
uh relation

1174
00:45:10,239 --> 00:45:17,759
the relationships between between these

1175
00:45:13,838 --> 00:45:20,480
the next stage is to increase this this

1176
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:22,400
this experiment to encompass perhaps

1177
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:24,800
more fruit and look at

1178
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:28,240
nutrient

1179
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:29,119
nutrient concentrations and storability

1180
00:45:28,239 --> 00:45:31,679
and

1181
00:45:29,119 --> 00:45:35,200
bricks and everything so we see we see

1182
00:45:31,679 --> 00:45:37,838
that the the rootstock at least

1183
00:45:35,199 --> 00:45:41,759
is having is having an effect

1184
00:45:37,838 --> 00:45:44,960
uh on uh on bricks and uh and the

1185
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:48,720
maturity of of the of the apple

1186
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:51,280
um or how soft that apple is when when

1187
00:45:48,719 --> 00:45:53,199
after i think it was two months of

1188
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:54,880
storage

1189
00:45:53,199 --> 00:45:57,118
so the question is can we select

1190
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:59,119
rootstocks that do a better job at

1191
00:45:57,119 --> 00:46:02,400
maintaining

1192
00:45:59,119 --> 00:46:04,000
that perhaps increasing bricks and uh

1193
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:07,519
and uh

1194
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:09,679
maintaining a good uh firmness

1195
00:46:07,519 --> 00:46:15,159
uh to to the apple yeah another

1196
00:46:09,679 --> 00:46:15,159
complexity but um so

1197
00:46:15,838 --> 00:46:19,119
what rootstocks would we choose in this

1198
00:46:17,519 --> 00:46:21,838
case if we

1199
00:46:19,119 --> 00:46:24,000
were just looking at this population as

1200
00:46:21,838 --> 00:46:25,279
uh as the breeder does and and we're

1201
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:27,679
looking

1202
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:30,400
discarding dwarfing and all of these

1203
00:46:27,679 --> 00:46:33,039
other uh elements

1204
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:36,800
so just based on nitrogen

1205
00:46:33,039 --> 00:46:39,199
phosphorus potassium and magnesium

1206
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:40,960
you see that they grew pretty well and

1207
00:46:39,199 --> 00:46:44,239
and

1208
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:46,800
potassium uh potassium and phosphorus

1209
00:46:44,239 --> 00:46:47,919
kind of go along together for uh for for

1210
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:49,039
the ride

1211
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:51,838
so

1212
00:46:49,039 --> 00:46:54,000
we can we can do this

1213
00:46:51,838 --> 00:46:56,639
um but there's still a lot of questions

1214
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:59,280
that need to be need to be answered in

1215
00:46:56,639 --> 00:47:01,199
the next five 10 15 years and depending

1216
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:03,839
on whether we get the multi-million

1217
00:47:01,199 --> 00:47:06,480
dollar grants to uh to fund this

1218
00:47:03,838 --> 00:47:09,039
uh with plenty i mean if you guys have

1219
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:11,358
any ideas and then

1220
00:47:09,039 --> 00:47:13,279
want to want to study this please i

1221
00:47:11,358 --> 00:47:15,119
welcome your help

1222
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:17,599
but

1223
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:20,480
what we have found is that

1224
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:22,318
the the nutri concentrations can are

1225
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:23,280
modified by

1226
00:47:22,318 --> 00:47:24,639
many

1227
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:27,680
segregating

1228
00:47:24,639 --> 00:47:30,318
loci in in in a germplasm

1229
00:47:27,679 --> 00:47:32,719
uh tree side affects tree size that can

1230
00:47:30,318 --> 00:47:34,480
affect fruit

1231
00:47:32,719 --> 00:47:36,959
just by

1232
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:39,119
just by having an effect on three sides

1233
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:41,440
and where the fruit exposure is to the

1234
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:41,440
sun

1235
00:47:41,838 --> 00:47:45,519
there is

1236
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:47,440
significant rootstock by genotype soil

1237
00:47:45,519 --> 00:47:49,440
interaction

1238
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:52,880
is it going to be the source of the

1239
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:54,800
terroir for apple cider or

1240
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:57,599
something like that

1241
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:59,280
and the questions

1242
00:47:57,599 --> 00:48:01,280
what does does

1243
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:03,440
nutrient deficiency have any effect on

1244
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:04,800
disease resistance

1245
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:06,318
perhaps

1246
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:07,599
you know we have interesting data that

1247
00:48:06,318 --> 00:48:09,759
might show that

1248
00:48:07,599 --> 00:48:11,440
and then should we select for higher low

1249
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:14,720
potassium

1250
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:17,039
uh in in our germplasm and those are the

1251
00:48:14,719 --> 00:48:20,078
easy ones but we can do more

1252
00:48:17,039 --> 00:48:21,679
uh what genes are underneath all of all

1253
00:48:20,079 --> 00:48:23,119
of these and specific greens so we were

1254
00:48:21,679 --> 00:48:24,719
lucky to find

1255
00:48:23,119 --> 00:48:27,358
the potassium one because there was an

1256
00:48:24,719 --> 00:48:31,439
eqtl sitting right on top of our of our

1257
00:48:27,358 --> 00:48:31,440
potassium qtl and that was like okay

1258
00:48:32,079 --> 00:48:36,240
but

1259
00:48:33,358 --> 00:48:40,078
can we look at different uh nutrients uh

1260
00:48:36,239 --> 00:48:41,439
calcium can we can we increase calcium

1261
00:48:40,079 --> 00:48:44,880
decrease

1262
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:44,880
nitrogen and so on and so forth so

1263
00:48:45,199 --> 00:48:48,399
we're

1264
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:50,480
doing more work

1265
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:52,400
uh we have uh

1266
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:55,440
different science that that we've

1267
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:57,358
grafted onto the the same populations

1268
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:59,119
and then we're expanding this work on

1269
00:48:57,358 --> 00:49:00,558
different uh other population of

1270
00:48:59,119 --> 00:49:01,519
rootstocks

1271
00:49:00,559 --> 00:49:03,519
um

1272
00:49:01,519 --> 00:49:05,599
so

1273
00:49:03,519 --> 00:49:07,519
can we um

1274
00:49:05,599 --> 00:49:08,960
one one of the things that i didn't

1275
00:49:07,519 --> 00:49:10,480
quite explain is

1276
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:12,800
is that the rootstock may have certain

1277
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:15,679
properties in terms of absorption and

1278
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:18,800
translocation but the cyan

1279
00:49:15,679 --> 00:49:20,960
may have its own properties its own

1280
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:22,318
channels its own things and so

1281
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:24,720
uh

1282
00:49:22,318 --> 00:49:27,279
looking at the interaction is i think is

1283
00:49:24,719 --> 00:49:30,159
going to be critical important

1284
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:31,440
and uh

1285
00:49:30,159 --> 00:49:32,318
how

1286
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:34,720
so

1287
00:49:32,318 --> 00:49:36,159
from from the perspective of of the of

1288
00:49:34,719 --> 00:49:38,318
the grower

1289
00:49:36,159 --> 00:49:39,358
how does a single gene or a couple of

1290
00:49:38,318 --> 00:49:42,838
genes

1291
00:49:39,358 --> 00:49:44,400
that affect nutrient uh absorption and

1292
00:49:42,838 --> 00:49:45,679
translocation

1293
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:48,480
how do

1294
00:49:45,679 --> 00:49:51,118
how can they modify the way we manage

1295
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:53,199
things in the orchard

1296
00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:56,160
are they going to make money

1297
00:49:53,199 --> 00:49:57,279
are they going to be detrimental and and

1298
00:49:56,159 --> 00:49:59,118
those are

1299
00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:02,160
all good questions

1300
00:49:59,119 --> 00:50:04,318
that uh need a few million dollars

1301
00:50:02,159 --> 00:50:06,399
so if you're uh

1302
00:50:04,318 --> 00:50:07,759
you know the the ride is a little bit

1303
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:10,240
curvy

1304
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:13,359
so i you know i try to imagine myself in

1305
00:50:10,239 --> 00:50:16,159
the ferrari and

1306
00:50:13,358 --> 00:50:19,279
i have to build it but

1307
00:50:16,159 --> 00:50:23,000
thank you for your time

1308
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:23,000
and if you have any questions

1309
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:39,079
this has been a production of cornell

1310
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:39,079
university on the web at cornell.edu

1311
00:50:40,719 --> 00:50:42,799
you
