1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:04,759
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:12,120
University awesome uh it's really great

3
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:14,039
to be presenting back in this room the

4
00:00:12,119 --> 00:00:18,079
last time I gave a seminar here was my

5
00:00:14,039 --> 00:00:19,799
job talk um many many years ago uh so

6
00:00:18,079 --> 00:00:24,159
this is very exciting to be back giving

7
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:27,199
my 10e seminar um before I jump into the

8
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:29,599
science I learn to overcome okay before

9
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:32,640
I jump into the science I really have to

10
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:36,039
thank uh my amazing lab members both

11
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:39,079
past and present uh who are just an

12
00:00:36,039 --> 00:00:42,399
incredibly strong and active group of

13
00:00:39,079 --> 00:00:44,759
people um I flipped back through my

14
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:46,960
photo re all the way to 2018 when we

15
00:00:44,759 --> 00:00:49,119
started and realized that we moved uh

16
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,520
lab spaces three different times so far

17
00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:53,320
hopefully one more time when the

18
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:56,160
renovations finished um and there was

19
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:58,238
almost no complaining during that time

20
00:00:56,159 --> 00:01:01,159
um just an incredibly adaptive group

21
00:00:58,238 --> 00:01:03,759
that um continued to science through the

22
00:01:01,159 --> 00:01:05,478
pandemic my first grad student graduated

23
00:01:03,759 --> 00:01:08,519
kind of in the midst of the pandemic and

24
00:01:05,478 --> 00:01:10,599
did um was just incredibly productive in

25
00:01:08,519 --> 00:01:13,039
that challenging time and now as we

26
00:01:10,599 --> 00:01:16,438
enter another challenging time I'm just

27
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:19,920
really proud of this group for um always

28
00:01:16,438 --> 00:01:22,919
uh looking for ways to push the science

29
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:25,040
forward so most of my lab's work it

30
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:26,840
focuses on plant grafting although as

31
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,118
you heard we had some soybean money so

32
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:30,320
we've done some other stuff too that I

33
00:01:28,118 --> 00:01:33,159
won't talk about today um I'll just

34
00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:35,158
focus on the grafting and grafting is

35
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:36,960
simply the physical joining of separate

36
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:39,799
plant parts so that they share an

37
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:40,839
interconnected vascular system and uh

38
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:43,280
throughout this talk I'll really

39
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:44,840
emphasize that last that second part of

40
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:47,000
the definition the interconnected

41
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:49,560
vascular system that's really crucial to

42
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,280
our understanding of what makes grafting

43
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:54,799
work um and grafting is pretty

44
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:58,200
remarkable it's our way of making real

45
00:01:54,799 --> 00:02:01,280
live Frankenstein's monsters um and it

46
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:03,920
happens incredibly easily in the plant

47
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:06,478
kingdom so Grafton actually occurs in

48
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:09,000
nature these are two examples of kissing

49
00:02:06,478 --> 00:02:11,840
trees that we saw in yosity on a hike

50
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,639
and this is a self defusing uh Tree by

51
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:18,000
the itha farmers market that you can see

52
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:19,559
here um and historians think that it was

53
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,159
human observations of these natural

54
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:23,560
graphs that inspired the first

55
00:02:21,159 --> 00:02:25,919
agricultural applications of grafting

56
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:30,199
which date back in the literature um to

57
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:33,518
424 BCE and it was likely co-invented um

58
00:02:30,199 --> 00:02:36,318
in ancient Greece and in Asia at the

59
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:39,039
same time um so when I say old tools for

60
00:02:36,318 --> 00:02:41,759
maximizing agriculture uh to some extent

61
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:44,519
these are prehistoric tools and really

62
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:48,399
uh anciently historic Tools in human

63
00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:49,879
f um there are many many applications of

64
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,239
grafting I'm just going to point out a

65
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:56,239
few prominent ones uh that we might care

66
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:57,920
about um so grafting is used uh across

67
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:00,959
viticulture to protect Vines from

68
00:02:57,919 --> 00:03:04,598
biionic stresses um there's a very

69
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:07,519
famous um decimation of European

70
00:03:04,598 --> 00:03:11,000
Vineyards um from the fxa outbreak uh

71
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:13,920
that was um in which The Vineyards were

72
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,878
saved through grafting to Missouri root

73
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:18,598
stocks wild Missouri root stocks um and

74
00:03:16,878 --> 00:03:22,280
so if you enjoy wine you might

75
00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:24,759
appreciate the um the the benefits of

76
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:27,280
grafting in this case um grafting is

77
00:03:24,759 --> 00:03:29,120
also used to modify plant architecture

78
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:32,840
um so here's an example of dwarfing root

79
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:34,879
stocks that um make apple harvest more

80
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:38,000
accessible this is also used in pear

81
00:03:34,878 --> 00:03:39,759
harvests um in the reverse Direction in

82
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,360
vegetable Crop Production grafting can

83
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:46,519
be used to invigorate the Chute system

84
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:49,920
or Scion and um greatly um improve

85
00:03:46,519 --> 00:03:52,158
yields in tomatoes and curits um

86
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:54,958
predominantly and that's a a direct

87
00:03:52,158 --> 00:03:56,759
topic of my lab uh grafting is also used

88
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:59,199
in Horticultural art this is an example

89
00:03:56,759 --> 00:04:00,840
of 40 different varieties grafted onto

90
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:04,078
One stock

91
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:06,560
um and probably one of the most recent

92
00:04:04,079 --> 00:04:08,640
Innovations in grafting is that you can

93
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:11,039
Harvest ketchup and fries from the same

94
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:14,798
plant um and you can actually buy this

95
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:18,279
in the UK and it's covered on a a stepen

96
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:23,160
uh CH bear episode so it's very famous

97
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:27,000
um so um grafting has wide Horticultural

98
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:29,120
uses um but in our case uh most of us

99
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,800
probably read about grafting when we're

100
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:35,800
studying mobile signaling and so it's

101
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:39,000
also used to demonstrate um the movement

102
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:41,918
and signaling function of peptides small

103
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,360
rnas um an emerging field is Messenger

104
00:04:41,918 --> 00:04:47,839
rnas that we're doing a lot of work in

105
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:49,280
um and hormones and so grafting um is

106
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:51,959
really the gold standard for

107
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:55,119
demonstrating mobile signaling and that

108
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:56,719
was uh this area of grafting was really

109
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,519
the extent of my knowledge when I

110
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:01,600
entered into the field of grafting of a

111
00:04:58,519 --> 00:05:03,758
postc um and then as I learned about its

112
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:06,120
dominance in agricultural production I

113
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:08,280
really became fascinated with the the

114
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:10,720
concept that we could actually use

115
00:05:08,279 --> 00:05:12,478
modern molecular tools to understand

116
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:14,840
some of the molecular biology that

117
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:18,159
underlies um beneficial agricultural

118
00:05:14,839 --> 00:05:20,959
grafting and potentially um start to

119
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:23,080
engineer beneficial graphs for

120
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:26,399
agricultural systems which I think were

121
00:05:23,079 --> 00:05:28,639
really at the cusp of doing uh just now

122
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:30,279
seven years almost seven years into

123
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:33,639
having the lab

124
00:05:30,279 --> 00:05:36,038
um so we do most of our work in tomato

125
00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:38,160
and the broader nightshade family

126
00:05:36,038 --> 00:05:40,038
because it's very easy to Gras I won't

127
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:42,600
show you this video just so I have

128
00:05:40,038 --> 00:05:45,120
enough time to get through everything um

129
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:47,560
but look it up it's produced by a

130
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:50,000
Cornell Alum Dr Molly Edwards who was

131
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:52,560
also in Mike scan's lab um when I was a

132
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,839
PhD student and she has a whole series

133
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:58,560
of science IRL videos so it's very easy

134
00:05:54,839 --> 00:06:02,079
to graph tomato it has almost 100% um

135
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:04,519
success in graph ing um and it heals

136
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:06,758
quite quickly relative to Woody crop

137
00:06:04,519 --> 00:06:09,120
systems and so this is the chot system

138
00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:11,639
or Scion and the root stock and this is

139
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:13,639
the joining graft system The graft

140
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:17,879
Junction um that's formed 10 days

141
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:20,319
postgrafting um and so we have a very uh

142
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:22,800
popular technique that we use in the lab

143
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:24,759
with h confocal Imaging of cleared

144
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:27,360
tissue where we can actually image into

145
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:30,080
the that graph Junction and study the

146
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,879
vascular connectivity that occurs

147
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:33,560
as the two parts of the plant heal

148
00:06:31,879 --> 00:06:36,079
together and so here we're getting into

149
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:39,280
the vascular system and you can see that

150
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:42,519
the regenerative processes um that are

151
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:46,598
occurring give this beautiful uh stitch

152
00:06:42,519 --> 00:06:48,918
together xylem and flum system um and so

153
00:06:46,598 --> 00:06:50,839
we can look at how that is disrupted and

154
00:06:48,918 --> 00:06:53,079
the genes that are involved in placing

155
00:06:50,839 --> 00:06:55,719
that vasculature so the pl plant can

156
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:59,318
reconnect um partially using this this

157
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:59,319
anatomical Imaging

158
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:04,399
another reason to study grafting in

159
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:06,000
tomatoes is that they are widely grafted

160
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:07,799
for commercial production so how many

161
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,839
people in the room knew that the

162
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:13,240
tomatoes that you buy at wigman's or

163
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:15,119
your favorite grocery store are

164
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:17,199
grafted yeah because I've been here a

165
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:21,399
few years but still not

166
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:23,639
everyone so so um pretty much all um

167
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:26,560
Tomatoes produced through um controlled

168
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:30,000
indoor agricultural systems are grafted

169
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:31,759
to root stocks that both invigorate um

170
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,639
the production of the S as well as

171
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:36,680
provide abiotic and biotic stress

172
00:07:33,639 --> 00:07:38,478
protect protection and this is um a trip

173
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:40,519
that I took the very first summer of

174
00:07:38,478 --> 00:07:42,079
starting my lab um to the Netherlands

175
00:07:40,519 --> 00:07:43,959
where I visited a plant

176
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:46,839
propagation facility where they were

177
00:07:43,959 --> 00:07:48,399
getting ready to graft 100,000 plants to

178
00:07:46,839 --> 00:07:51,598
ship to the Middle East for production

179
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:53,679
so it's used around the world um in

180
00:07:51,598 --> 00:07:55,680
agricultural production and so hopefully

181
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:58,639
some of the stuff that we learn can

182
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:03,240
influence um some of the practices in

183
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:06,079
positive ways in um in tomato production

184
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:08,960
um so despite the fact that grafting um

185
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:11,318
has been used internationally for

186
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:13,598
Millennia um there are still some core

187
00:08:11,319 --> 00:08:16,520
questions that motivate the exciting

188
00:08:13,598 --> 00:08:19,399
biology that we do in the lab um and so

189
00:08:16,519 --> 00:08:20,799
one um really exciting and challenging

190
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:23,758
question is how different draft

191
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:25,960
combinations produce emergent phenotypes

192
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:30,080
especially phenotypes um that are

193
00:08:25,959 --> 00:08:31,878
beneficial to us um

194
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:34,079
and then another question is just what

195
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:36,680
moves across the graph Junction and to

196
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:39,320
what extent are mobile molecules

197
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:42,120
functioning as signals and we're really

198
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:43,839
focusing on mobile messenger rnas here

199
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:46,320
which I don't have time to talk about

200
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:49,360
but I'll will point you to some great

201
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:52,120
resources from my lab during the talk um

202
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:54,080
and then finally at the most basic level

203
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:55,600
we don't have a good understanding of

204
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,200
what determines whether or not two

205
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:59,440
species are going to be compatible with

206
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:01,800
each other whether or not they can form

207
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:04,600
interconnected vasculature during

208
00:09:01,799 --> 00:09:06,958
grafting um and by compatible I mean the

209
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:08,959
ability for two things to coexist

210
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:11,518
without problems or conflict so the

211
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:13,559
ability for them to stitch together um

212
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:16,639
and so we study our questions in this

213
00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:19,199
compatibility framework where um two

214
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:22,838
things can grasp but maybe they have uh

215
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:25,600
like no uh appreciable beneficial impact

216
00:09:22,839 --> 00:09:28,120
on each other um on the other end of the

217
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,720
spectrum two things um that are

218
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:32,720
incompatible have a problem atic

219
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:37,639
coexistence so they're unable to coexist

220
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:39,440
um in that Gras um format and then um on

221
00:09:37,639 --> 00:09:41,159
the The Beneficial side Ultra

222
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:43,839
compatibility is where two things can

223
00:09:41,159 --> 00:09:46,439
graft and that graft produces beneficial

224
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:50,160
outputs um that we appreciate as humans

225
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:53,240
so not evolutionarily beneficial but um

226
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:56,120
uh appreciated by by us um through our

227
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:57,919
lens and so a lot of the work um that

228
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:59,879
we've done is on this spectrum of

229
00:09:57,919 --> 00:10:02,439
compatibility and incompatibility

230
00:09:59,879 --> 00:10:05,000
uh because my first student to join the

231
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:06,360
lab Dr Hannah Thomas was super excited

232
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,679
about these questions so she really

233
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:13,159
carved out um a lot of work in this

234
00:10:08,679 --> 00:10:16,359
direction that um two p uh least

235
00:10:13,159 --> 00:10:18,639
bo uh PhD candidate and Sam yanders a

236
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:21,320
PhD student are now carrying

237
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:23,919
forward um and so graph incompatibility

238
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:26,278
is not a huge problem for tomato tomato

239
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:28,159
grafts pretty well to its wild relatives

240
00:10:26,278 --> 00:10:30,039
but it can be a big problem in Woody

241
00:10:28,159 --> 00:10:31,480
crops and it can go under detected for a

242
00:10:30,039 --> 00:10:33,958
long periods of time and this is really

243
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:36,800
a classic um graph incompatibility

244
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:39,759
between pear and Quint um where you can

245
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:43,679
see this um necrotic divide across the

246
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:47,200
junction and um by detecting that

247
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:49,559
incompatibility Growers can then um WRA

248
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:51,240
in an interstock that is mutually

249
00:10:49,559 --> 00:10:53,638
compatible with the root stock and the

250
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:55,360
scon which is super cool um so you can

251
00:10:53,639 --> 00:10:58,560
actually rescue these incompatibilities

252
00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:00,879
if you can detect them we think that the

253
00:10:58,559 --> 00:11:04,078
information that we learn from tomato is

254
00:11:00,879 --> 00:11:06,559
going to provide useful markers for um

255
00:11:04,078 --> 00:11:09,239
detecting incompatibility in these other

256
00:11:06,559 --> 00:11:11,919
systems because the process of grafting

257
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:15,519
is very similar across different species

258
00:11:11,919 --> 00:11:18,679
so when you graft um two things together

259
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:21,278
um there's an initial adhesion um that

260
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:24,439
is um

261
00:11:21,278 --> 00:11:27,278
a uh that that occurs through the

262
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:30,079
release of pectin that helps stick the

263
00:11:27,278 --> 00:11:32,039
cells together um

264
00:11:30,078 --> 00:11:34,759
and then a wound response process

265
00:11:32,039 --> 00:11:37,120
promotes the formation of palis uh and

266
00:11:34,759 --> 00:11:40,159
so that's like an undifferentiated wound

267
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:43,278
responsive tissue that then um starts to

268
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:46,078
make contact and the callus will start

269
00:11:43,278 --> 00:11:49,439
to form plasmodes model connections and

270
00:11:46,078 --> 00:11:52,319
communicate across the graph um that

271
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:54,360
callus fills in and through that space

272
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:57,000
um vascular differentiation and other

273
00:11:54,360 --> 00:12:01,759
tissue tissue differentiation starts to

274
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:03,879
occur um and then subsequent quent um

275
00:12:01,759 --> 00:12:06,200
phys the resumption of physiological

276
00:12:03,879 --> 00:12:08,559
transport and subsequent um

277
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:11,360
differentiation leads to a very very

278
00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:13,638
strong um

279
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:15,720
Junction that is actually stronger than

280
00:12:13,639 --> 00:12:18,039
any other part in the stem because you

281
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:20,199
now have extra vascular extra

282
00:12:18,039 --> 00:12:22,159
magnification and so this whole process

283
00:12:20,198 --> 00:12:24,039
involves local signaling to actually

284
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:26,480
place the vascular strands in the right

285
00:12:24,039 --> 00:12:29,599
place to reconnect the two plant parts

286
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:33,039
and that process is not um under at the

287
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:35,079
molecular level um the the use of

288
00:12:33,039 --> 00:12:38,639
vascular patterning and differentiation

289
00:12:35,078 --> 00:12:40,599
genes um and all of these processes um

290
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:42,399
affect the integrity and biophysical

291
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:44,560
strength of the plant at the end and

292
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:46,600
you'll see um how that informs some of

293
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:48,679
the tests we use to look at

294
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:50,600
compatibility um so to understand

295
00:12:48,679 --> 00:12:52,958
compatibility in our system we grafted

296
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:55,040
tomato to a bunch of different um night

297
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:57,078
shade relatives that were readily

298
00:12:55,039 --> 00:12:59,198
available and just looked at whether or

299
00:12:57,078 --> 00:13:02,759
not there were negative impacts on the

300
00:12:59,198 --> 00:13:05,039
plant um in response to grafting and we

301
00:13:02,759 --> 00:13:07,879
found a really pronounced negative

302
00:13:05,039 --> 00:13:09,679
impact on pepper tomato combinations and

303
00:13:07,879 --> 00:13:11,198
so this is self grafted tomato and this

304
00:13:09,679 --> 00:13:14,239
is perer and

305
00:13:11,198 --> 00:13:16,919
pepato and I think this picture really

306
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:19,079
uh accentuates the the impact of the

307
00:13:16,919 --> 00:13:22,039
negative graft this is tomato on a

308
00:13:19,078 --> 00:13:24,159
Cayenne root stock um graft at the same

309
00:13:22,039 --> 00:13:26,399
time as self-grafted tomato and so often

310
00:13:24,159 --> 00:13:29,879
these plants are physiologically um

311
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:33,440
impaired which leads to stumped growth

312
00:13:29,879 --> 00:13:35,399
um and and so it's a pretty clear um

313
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:38,639
incompatibility phenotype but

314
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:40,120
importantly the plants do live um

315
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:42,919
otherwise it' be hard to study them and

316
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:46,360
so we we consider this system uh an

317
00:13:42,919 --> 00:13:49,078
example of delayed incompatibility where

318
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:51,680
um they're unable to graft but they're

319
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:54,278
able to survive for long periods of time

320
00:13:51,679 --> 00:13:56,439
and I've actually had a Topper plant

321
00:13:54,278 --> 00:13:58,759
live in my office for over a year so

322
00:13:56,440 --> 00:14:01,199
they can they can live and grow very

323
00:13:58,759 --> 00:14:05,199
very slowly for a very long

324
00:14:01,198 --> 00:14:06,838
time um and so a lot of Hannah's work

325
00:14:05,198 --> 00:14:09,319
looked at what causes this

326
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:11,480
incompatibility in pep NATO um and

327
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:13,480
before I dive into it I'll just show you

328
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:16,480
some of the the detailed information we

329
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:17,920
have about what happens when tomato is

330
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:20,759
self-grafted so when we have a

331
00:14:17,919 --> 00:14:23,240
compatible graft forming and this was um

332
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:25,919
collected in collaboration with uh

333
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:29,560
nuclear physicist at wasu med school Dr

334
00:14:25,919 --> 00:14:32,039
Yan chant Tha who uh just had a unique

335
00:14:29,559 --> 00:14:34,719
passion for plants and built his pet

336
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:37,759
imager which is allows the tracking of

337
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:41,519
radiol labeled nucleid um through 3D

338
00:14:37,759 --> 00:14:43,199
space and time um he built it inside of

339
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:45,519
a growth chamber so you could do

340
00:14:43,198 --> 00:14:49,359
physiologically relevant experiments in

341
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:53,198
Plants um and so we used that to track

342
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:56,120
um a labeled carbon CO2 movement in

343
00:14:53,198 --> 00:14:58,399
grafted plants um that were sealed they

344
00:14:56,120 --> 00:15:00,600
had an airtight seal right above the

345
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:04,240
junction what you can see is that at 5

346
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:06,360
days postgrafting um we start seeing the

347
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:07,919
resumption of carbon transport and so

348
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:10,680
that indicates that physiological

349
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:13,360
transport through the flum um happens as

350
00:15:10,679 --> 00:15:15,758
early as five days post grafting in this

351
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:19,320
setup um and then we used a labeled

352
00:15:15,759 --> 00:15:21,320
nitrogen to Track xylm Transport um

353
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:24,440
because labeled water has a very short

354
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:27,160
halflife and um we saw that uh the

355
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:29,279
plants resume transport as early as six

356
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:32,958
days post grafting and So within Le than

357
00:15:29,278 --> 00:15:34,120
a week you have a um a heel Junction

358
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:37,838
that's

359
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:39,519
transporting um in pep M we didn't have

360
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:41,920
access to the pet imager although I'm

361
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:44,159
pretty excited about the new XLE

362
00:15:41,919 --> 00:15:47,559
proposal um I think the synchron will

363
00:15:44,159 --> 00:15:50,799
have similar capacities in a few years

364
00:15:47,559 --> 00:15:53,119
um so we used a uh fluorescent die

365
00:15:50,799 --> 00:15:55,039
called cfda that's flow immobile you can

366
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:57,318
see the aphids that are contaminating

367
00:15:55,039 --> 00:16:01,198
our plant um are taking it up in their

368
00:15:57,318 --> 00:16:04,318
bellies um one one example of good

369
00:16:01,198 --> 00:16:07,838
contamination I guess

370
00:16:04,318 --> 00:16:10,559
um and when we look at cfda it uh gets

371
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:13,000
stopped at the junction um and so we

372
00:16:10,559 --> 00:16:15,518
looked closer into the anatomy of these

373
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,318
grafted plants um and we you can see in

374
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:20,198
self-crafted Plants you have these nice

375
00:16:17,318 --> 00:16:25,479
long spaghetti strings of zylin running

376
00:16:20,198 --> 00:16:28,278
through um and then in pepato we have um

377
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:31,079
this disorganized vasculature so it's

378
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:33,240
forming these an asmosis and failing to

379
00:16:31,078 --> 00:16:35,399
connect and communicate across the

380
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:37,240
junction uh we see a very similar

381
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:39,799
phenomenon in the reciprocal Direction

382
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:44,480
This Is Now with arming o staining um

383
00:16:39,799 --> 00:16:46,958
for lignan and um you get this mass of

384
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:48,759
differentiating vasculature that's

385
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:51,599
failing to communicate and coordinate

386
00:16:48,759 --> 00:16:55,000
with the other half of the graft um so

387
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:56,639
we consider these Bridges to Nowhere um

388
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,679
and we actually have a bridge to nowhere

389
00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:01,600
here in IA um how many people know the

390
00:16:59,679 --> 00:17:05,119
plans for the bridge to nowhere in

391
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:07,038
IA true okay so it's pretty exciting um

392
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:08,479
it's getting connected to a major trail

393
00:17:07,038 --> 00:17:11,199
system so it will become a bridge to

394
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:13,519
somewhere very soon um and that's kind

395
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:14,679
of Our Hope with this work too is one

396
00:17:13,519 --> 00:17:17,318
day we can rescue these

397
00:17:14,679 --> 00:17:19,240
incompatibilities so we're not there yet

398
00:17:17,318 --> 00:17:21,119
um and so basically the plant is forming

399
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:22,640
Bridges but they're not connecting

400
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:25,879
across they're not reconnecting the

401
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:28,199
physiological transport and this has um

402
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:29,919
major consequences for the biophysical

403
00:17:28,199 --> 00:17:33,038
stability of the stem and so this is a

404
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:34,919
bend test that Hannah invented um and

405
00:17:33,038 --> 00:17:37,640
basically you bend the plant and if it

406
00:17:34,919 --> 00:17:38,919
breaks at the junction it fails the test

407
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:41,038
um because that Junction is supposed to

408
00:17:38,919 --> 00:17:42,960
be the strongest point in the stem um

409
00:17:41,038 --> 00:17:46,200
and if it breaks anywhere else it passes

410
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:48,160
the test and so toer and pepato almost

411
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:50,880
always break up the stem every once in a

412
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:53,400
while you get um an exception because

413
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:55,760
it's biology but almost always break it

414
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:57,759
the stem um so another thing we looked

415
00:17:55,759 --> 00:17:59,640
at was uh whether we could identify some

416
00:17:57,759 --> 00:18:01,359
genetic regulators um that are

417
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:05,080
controlling this compatibility and so we

418
00:18:01,359 --> 00:18:07,879
collected RNA data of Pep and toer

419
00:18:05,079 --> 00:18:10,158
graphs and um tomato and pepper self

420
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:12,360
grafts at 1 three and five days

421
00:18:10,159 --> 00:18:15,400
postgrafting and we worked with Dr

422
00:18:12,359 --> 00:18:17,959
rani's Lab at NC State to build that I

423
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:19,880
think are like above average pretty Gene

424
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:23,279
networks they look organized to me at

425
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:27,240
least um and they were able to identify

426
00:18:23,279 --> 00:18:30,359
um putative major Regulators of graph

427
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:32,839
formation at the war three and five day

428
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:34,798
time points as well as mixed time points

429
00:18:32,839 --> 00:18:37,519
and then we and this is for self-grafted

430
00:18:34,798 --> 00:18:41,119
tomato the networks for incompatible

431
00:18:37,519 --> 00:18:43,759
graphs were crazy and really hard to

432
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:46,839
navigate it was like this huge mess of

433
00:18:43,759 --> 00:18:49,960
uh disregulation I guess um and so what

434
00:18:46,839 --> 00:18:52,158
we did was we mapped on um the loss of

435
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:55,679
connectivity in the network um to look

436
00:18:52,159 --> 00:18:57,559
for geneses that were important um in

437
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:59,640
compatible graph formation that are

438
00:18:57,558 --> 00:19:01,440
disrupted in the in compatible graphs

439
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:04,559
and this is just an example of one gene

440
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:07,919
that we see that has um altered

441
00:19:04,558 --> 00:19:11,119
connectivity it's GTI 5 um that Dr Greg

442
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:14,799
Martin's lab happened to have um mutants

443
00:19:11,119 --> 00:19:18,599
for because it inter it's um yeah

444
00:19:14,798 --> 00:19:22,000
interacts with um avrpto one of his

445
00:19:18,599 --> 00:19:25,199
favorite um mutants and so um this is

446
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:27,279
cool this was implicated uh to function

447
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,759
and grafting that one day postgrafting

448
00:19:27,279 --> 00:19:32,960
which is when those cells should be

449
00:19:28,759 --> 00:19:35,919
adhering to each other um and so uh we

450
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:37,720
see that the vascular connects the graph

451
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:40,679
actually forms okay but there's this

452
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:43,319
fissure that remains at the the wound

453
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:44,679
site um and we have more work to do to

454
00:19:43,319 --> 00:19:46,759
understand what's going on there but

455
00:19:44,679 --> 00:19:49,320
it's kind of a neat example of the

456
00:19:46,759 --> 00:19:51,200
networks informing some of the biology

457
00:19:49,319 --> 00:19:53,558
um so one thing that surprised us was

458
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:55,360
that most of the hubs in the self graph

459
00:19:53,558 --> 00:19:58,319
networks and in these incompatible

460
00:19:55,359 --> 00:19:59,199
graphs um are not related to vascular

461
00:19:58,319 --> 00:20:02,558
patterns

462
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:04,240
but our big um you know most apparent

463
00:20:02,558 --> 00:20:07,319
phenotype in these incomparable graphs

464
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:10,200
is disorganized vasculature and we think

465
00:20:07,319 --> 00:20:12,839
that that's because um a minority of the

466
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:15,960
cells in the the harvested tissue are

467
00:20:12,839 --> 00:20:18,558
actually forming new vasculature um so

468
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:20,519
it's a bulk Arn AEK data set with a lot

469
00:20:18,558 --> 00:20:22,558
of different things happening and so

470
00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:25,038
they're less pronounced in the network

471
00:20:22,558 --> 00:20:28,240
um so we pulled out known vascular

472
00:20:25,038 --> 00:20:30,720
patterning genes um based on a network

473
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:35,319
from opsis that's really nicely

474
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:37,720
characterized um and we uh built our own

475
00:20:35,319 --> 00:20:39,519
network from these genes based on what's

476
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:42,798
uh differentially expressed across our

477
00:20:39,519 --> 00:20:45,759
time points and graph types and um so in

478
00:20:42,798 --> 00:20:48,558
this network there's a lot of hypotheses

479
00:20:45,759 --> 00:20:50,599
to be tested but one was the role of

480
00:20:48,558 --> 00:20:54,000
this transcription Factor called blcks

481
00:20:50,599 --> 00:20:57,240
four um that's involved in Cambo

482
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,720
specification and so uh one indication

483
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:01,839
that it might be important in this

484
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:05,679
process is that it gets has somewhat

485
00:21:01,839 --> 00:21:07,918
chaotic expression in uh toer and pep

486
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:11,559
relative to self-grafted where it has

487
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:14,000
this gradual elevation in expression um

488
00:21:11,558 --> 00:21:17,440
and we are also able to obtain mutants

489
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:19,759
for this from Zack litman's lab um which

490
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:24,360
is very nice this was in 2020 when it

491
00:21:19,759 --> 00:21:26,679
was challenging to to to do um lots of

492
00:21:24,359 --> 00:21:29,199
wet lab work um and so you can see these

493
00:21:26,679 --> 00:21:31,400
walks for mutants um there

494
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,919
relatively normal they're a little bit

495
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:35,600
centered in growth but generally they

496
00:21:32,919 --> 00:21:38,360
look like a normal tomato they make a

497
00:21:35,599 --> 00:21:40,879
vascular bundles um so they have a nice

498
00:21:38,359 --> 00:21:44,759
stem anatomy and when we graft them they

499
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:46,960
have high survival rates um and so um

500
00:21:44,759 --> 00:21:50,480
this is self-grafted wild type this is

501
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:53,759
self-grafted walk 4 100% survival it was

502
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:56,480
pretty disappointing um but then Hannah

503
00:21:53,759 --> 00:21:59,278
performed the bend test and saw that

504
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:01,400
100% of them actually break at the jump

505
00:21:59,278 --> 00:22:04,240
and so that's an indication that there's

506
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:05,919
a loss of um biophysical stability even

507
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:10,079
though the plants survive and so that's

508
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:12,480
like um maybe our like uh big PR message

509
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:15,918
from the lab is that survival doesn't

510
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:18,200
equal compatibility um we can actually

511
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:20,320
look at the anatomy of these walk spor

512
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:23,440
plants Rel such to Wild type that form

513
00:22:20,319 --> 00:22:25,759
vascular connections and um we see that

514
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:27,720
they are impaired in specifying vascular

515
00:22:25,759 --> 00:22:34,319
connections and Elise is looking more

516
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:38,960
into the extent to which um this occurs

517
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:42,278
so um so so it's pretty cool that these

518
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:45,600
networks helped us find you know one one

519
00:22:42,278 --> 00:22:48,919
regulator in the process of vascular

520
00:22:45,599 --> 00:22:53,558
specification um and if we go back to

521
00:22:48,919 --> 00:22:56,000
the um vascular network from a Rabbid

522
00:22:53,558 --> 00:22:58,519
opsis you can see that there's other

523
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,159
potential genes that are likely involved

524
00:22:58,519 --> 00:23:03,240
in placing the vasculature in the right

525
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:04,919
place um so that reconnections happen um

526
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:08,159
so walk Flor is the one that we looked

527
00:23:04,919 --> 00:23:11,600
at um but Upstream of walk FL are these

528
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:14,360
um small signaling peptides called TS or

529
00:23:11,599 --> 00:23:18,678
cleas um and CLE 41 is one of those

530
00:23:14,359 --> 00:23:21,119
genes that help specify a walk fork in

531
00:23:18,679 --> 00:23:23,919
the process of vascular patterning and

532
00:23:21,119 --> 00:23:25,798
so um we are also able to get a mutant

533
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:28,720
for that and it looks like it's

534
00:23:25,798 --> 00:23:31,440
disrupted again in the vascular specific

535
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:35,159
ation um and again Elise is looking into

536
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:38,320
the extent to which um this occurs and

537
00:23:35,159 --> 00:23:41,320
and whether this um really a luring

538
00:23:38,319 --> 00:23:43,240
signal could be um playing the major

539
00:23:41,319 --> 00:23:45,359
role in placing Bas coach in the right

540
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:47,038
place so that roots and shoots can can

541
00:23:45,359 --> 00:23:49,599
communicate post

542
00:23:47,038 --> 00:23:51,319
drafting um and so one question that

543
00:23:49,599 --> 00:23:52,558
we've asked ourselves after collecting

544
00:23:51,319 --> 00:23:54,558
all this data and looking at these

545
00:23:52,558 --> 00:23:57,119
mutants is whether we've really

546
00:23:54,558 --> 00:24:00,960
explained graph incompatibility so it do

547
00:23:57,119 --> 00:24:04,918
walks for look like um our pepato Ander

548
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:08,000
mutants and i' think not really um so in

549
00:24:04,919 --> 00:24:10,120
pepato we have disorganized vascular

550
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,640
proliferation and in walks four we just

551
00:24:10,119 --> 00:24:15,079
fail to specify the vasculature so these

552
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:16,720
networks are telling us um about genes

553
00:24:15,079 --> 00:24:19,599
that are essential in grafting but maybe

554
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:22,558
not explaining the phenomenon of

555
00:24:19,599 --> 00:24:26,158
incompatibility uh so Hannah dug deeper

556
00:24:22,558 --> 00:24:29,000
into the role of tissue death in

557
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:32,600
incompatibility um again this is an 2020

558
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:36,679
was dark times and um and so she just

559
00:24:32,599 --> 00:24:39,798
looked at um basically the Persistence

560
00:24:36,679 --> 00:24:41,679
of dead tissue at The graft over a long

561
00:24:39,798 --> 00:24:44,960
periods of time using this trien blue

562
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:47,440
staining where this deep purple color um

563
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:50,278
means that the cells are dead um and

564
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:54,278
these lighter Purple colors um are kind

565
00:24:50,278 --> 00:24:57,240
of just noise in the Imaging um and so

566
00:24:54,278 --> 00:25:00,038
she looked at seven 14 and 21 days after

567
00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:03,200
grafting um and what she found she

568
00:25:00,038 --> 00:25:04,558
Quantified it using an imagej pipeline

569
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:07,038
um and what she found is that there's

570
00:25:04,558 --> 00:25:09,720
similar levels of dead tissue one week

571
00:25:07,038 --> 00:25:12,359
after grafting in self-grafted plants

572
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:14,038
and incompatible graphs um but over time

573
00:25:12,359 --> 00:25:17,359
the self grafts will clear that dead

574
00:25:14,038 --> 00:25:20,519
tissue and the incompatible graphs um

575
00:25:17,359 --> 00:25:22,119
persist in having dead tissue so of

576
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:25,440
course you wanted to see what was

577
00:25:22,119 --> 00:25:29,038
happening in terms of gene expression um

578
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:31,880
in this this uh persistent tissue death

579
00:25:29,038 --> 00:25:34,158
process um so she did RNA at these time

580
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:36,799
points as well um and this time she

581
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:39,159
pulled apart the San half of the graph

582
00:25:36,798 --> 00:25:40,960
and stock half of the graph so this top

583
00:25:39,159 --> 00:25:43,520
half is Canan data this bottom half is

584
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:45,360
stock and she just looked at um

585
00:25:43,519 --> 00:25:47,918
differential expression and saw that the

586
00:25:45,359 --> 00:25:49,798
incompatible graphs um this is align to

587
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:52,640
the to Tomato genome and this is to the

588
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:55,200
pepper genome a lot of factors here the

589
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:57,080
incompatible graphs have a dramatic up

590
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:59,600
regulation and down regulation of

591
00:25:57,079 --> 00:26:03,759
differentially expressed

592
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:05,359
genes um and uh there's a lot of go

593
00:26:03,759 --> 00:26:06,839
categories that are enriched across

594
00:26:05,359 --> 00:26:08,639
these time points but there are some

595
00:26:06,839 --> 00:26:11,398
that uh point us towards some really

596
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:12,919
cool models for what's happening so one

597
00:26:11,398 --> 00:26:14,199
which is just a nice reality check is

598
00:26:12,919 --> 00:26:16,399
that there's a response to water

599
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:19,558
deprivation it's not making xylm

600
00:26:16,398 --> 00:26:21,439
connections so that that felt right um

601
00:26:19,558 --> 00:26:24,720
it's still unclear how plants live for

602
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:28,840
this long without making ayl connections

603
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:31,278
um that's a open physiological mystery

604
00:26:28,839 --> 00:26:33,639
um but in addition there's a lot of um

605
00:26:31,278 --> 00:26:37,278
these geneontology categories related to

606
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:38,960
the plant immune system um and defense

607
00:26:37,278 --> 00:26:42,398
and so Hannah's big

608
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:43,919
hypothesis um from this data and she she

609
00:26:42,398 --> 00:26:46,519
did a lot more digging that I won't go

610
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:49,679
into but her big hypothesis is that the

611
00:26:46,519 --> 00:26:51,519
incompatible combinations of genomes are

612
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:53,759
causing this activation of the plant

613
00:26:51,519 --> 00:26:56,278
immune system that's leading to cell

614
00:26:53,759 --> 00:26:58,839
death and if you want to hear more about

615
00:26:56,278 --> 00:27:00,480
kind of our um

616
00:26:58,839 --> 00:27:03,038
our approach to digging into the

617
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:05,839
molecular details and mechanisms that

618
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:09,000
might be working within this uh this

619
00:27:05,839 --> 00:27:09,798
hypothesis go to Sam Meander seminar

620
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,240
next

621
00:27:09,798 --> 00:27:15,798
month um the student

622
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:18,200
seminar um so so another question um

623
00:27:15,798 --> 00:27:20,519
that we looked at is whether pepato and

624
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:22,640
toer are a specific type of

625
00:27:20,519 --> 00:27:25,200
incompatibility or whether there're some

626
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:28,240
general rules that guide incompatibility

627
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:30,159
in this branch of the Sol and AC and so

628
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:33,519
what Hannah did was she did these

629
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:37,200
reciprocal graphs across um a few

630
00:27:33,519 --> 00:27:39,038
members of the solenoid that were uh

631
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:42,880
possible to grow in graph together and

632
00:27:39,038 --> 00:27:45,240
we ignored uh NIOSA and envent of

633
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:49,159
tobacco because there's some like pretty

634
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:53,038
wild reports of um Nana being able to

635
00:27:49,159 --> 00:27:54,640
graft like across much any flowering

636
00:27:53,038 --> 00:27:57,240
plant family so it's like a super

637
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:59,840
grafter that's doing something uh

638
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:00,640
exceptional so we stuck to this branch

639
00:27:59,839 --> 00:28:03,558
of the

640
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:05,240
solenoid um and it doesn't look like a

641
00:28:03,558 --> 00:28:07,678
ton of plants to draft together but once

642
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:09,599
you start doing the reciprocal graphs in

643
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:13,038
replication it's actually a huge

644
00:28:09,599 --> 00:28:16,798
experiment um and again all the graphs

645
00:28:13,038 --> 00:28:19,679
survive so survivorship is not a measure

646
00:28:16,798 --> 00:28:21,918
of compatibility um self grafts form

647
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:24,360
really nice vascular connections that

648
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:28,120
string through um The

649
00:28:24,359 --> 00:28:30,398
Junction um intra generic grafts Within

650
00:28:28,119 --> 00:28:33,239
solanums this is tomato and eggplant

651
00:28:30,398 --> 00:28:36,119
form beautiful vascular connections um

652
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:39,319
and this is work done by Michelle he a

653
00:28:36,119 --> 00:28:42,518
PhD candidate in the lab um and in fact

654
00:28:39,319 --> 00:28:44,519
uh this system is so strong that it's uh

655
00:28:42,519 --> 00:28:46,720
formed the system that she's using to

656
00:28:44,519 --> 00:28:48,079
look at long-distance communication

657
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:52,360
between

658
00:28:48,079 --> 00:28:55,599
species um but all intergeneric so

659
00:28:52,359 --> 00:28:58,558
across gener graphs fail to communicate

660
00:28:55,599 --> 00:29:00,558
and form these really really ugly um

661
00:28:58,558 --> 00:29:03,798
disorganized

662
00:29:00,558 --> 00:29:06,278
graphs um and so we did a ton of

663
00:29:03,798 --> 00:29:08,720
confocal Imaging to to look at this

664
00:29:06,278 --> 00:29:10,558
process um but we also perform the bend

665
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:12,440
test and that's a pretty good indicator

666
00:29:10,558 --> 00:29:15,960
of compatibility so pretty much all the

667
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:18,399
incompatible graphs here um break Almost

668
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:20,880
100% of the time with the bend test so

669
00:29:18,398 --> 00:29:24,839
you really don't have to do imaging if

670
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:28,919
you want like a fast measure of this um

671
00:29:24,839 --> 00:29:31,678
this property um and so to wrap up this

672
00:29:28,919 --> 00:29:34,720
part of the talk we have found many ways

673
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:34,720
to make grafts

674
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:41,399
fail um and uh also collected some

675
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:43,240
really great tools to study this in more

676
00:29:41,398 --> 00:29:47,119
depth so we've really expanded the tool

677
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:51,399
system here um and again uh T plant and

678
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:53,398
egg is another system for uh studying uh

679
00:29:51,398 --> 00:29:56,479
communication and Michelle has just

680
00:29:53,398 --> 00:29:58,199
awarded the uh the the best three minute

681
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:02,120
thesis in Cal so you can watch her her

682
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:05,038
talk on YouTube um or hear her talk uh

683
00:30:02,119 --> 00:30:08,639
in a real seminar for for much more

684
00:30:05,038 --> 00:30:10,759
in-depth uh view of the process um but

685
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:13,120
we're hoping to use these tools to to

686
00:30:10,759 --> 00:30:16,038
eventually um find ways to reconnect

687
00:30:13,119 --> 00:30:18,439
those bridges so make graphs uh succeed

688
00:30:16,038 --> 00:30:21,278
and that I think will be a tremendous

689
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:23,840
effort to to overcome incompatibilities

690
00:30:21,278 --> 00:30:26,519
but uh it's going to be

691
00:30:23,839 --> 00:30:29,079
exciting so I want to use the last part

692
00:30:26,519 --> 00:30:31,798
of the talk to talk about um this other

693
00:30:29,079 --> 00:30:33,720
end of the spectrum um where we're

694
00:30:31,798 --> 00:30:36,119
looking at compatibility this neutral

695
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:38,399
coexistence which is really home plant

696
00:30:36,119 --> 00:30:40,879
and EG they don't really have huge

697
00:30:38,398 --> 00:30:42,038
beneficial impacts on each other um and

698
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:47,760
Ultra

699
00:30:42,038 --> 00:30:50,158
compatibility um and so this is uh an

700
00:30:47,759 --> 00:30:52,679
area of work that's really kind of brand

701
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:55,278
new results coming out of the lab um and

702
00:30:52,679 --> 00:30:58,000
this is looking at the ability to

703
00:30:55,278 --> 00:31:00,159
program communication with implants for

704
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:05,319
alter compatibility from the Viewpoint

705
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:08,039
of the the farmer um or the human um and

706
00:31:05,319 --> 00:31:09,439
so the goal here is to actually

707
00:31:08,038 --> 00:31:10,960
reprogram the way plants are

708
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:12,639
communicating to give us more

709
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:15,278
information about the environmental

710
00:31:12,638 --> 00:31:20,079
context in which plants are growing and

711
00:31:15,278 --> 00:31:21,599
um enhance the um timing and um

712
00:31:20,079 --> 00:31:25,638
quantitative responsive management

713
00:31:21,599 --> 00:31:28,158
practices from our end um and so the the

714
00:31:25,638 --> 00:31:30,959
first kind of example of this

715
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:33,880
reprogramming that we're looking at um

716
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:36,360
involves the signaling system called the

717
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:40,519
uh sep signaling system see terally

718
00:31:36,359 --> 00:31:43,879
encoded peptide say the name says it all

719
00:31:40,519 --> 00:31:45,558
and th this is um a root tissue and

720
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:48,039
shoot to root signaling system that

721
00:31:45,558 --> 00:31:51,319
allows roots to forage in heterogeneous

722
00:31:48,038 --> 00:31:53,319
nitrogen conditions um and it it's uh

723
00:31:51,319 --> 00:31:56,319
partially responsible for kind of the

724
00:31:53,319 --> 00:31:58,960
classic High nitrogen low nitrogen split

725
00:31:56,319 --> 00:32:00,759
plate response um um that's described in

726
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:02,440
the literature where Roots will um

727
00:32:00,759 --> 00:32:03,759
branch and grow more extensively in

728
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:06,038
areas of high

729
00:32:03,759 --> 00:32:08,638
nitrogen and so how this works is that

730
00:32:06,038 --> 00:32:11,519
under low nitrogen Roots will start to

731
00:32:08,638 --> 00:32:14,479
express these uh small peptides called

732
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:17,159
steps that move from root to shoot um

733
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:19,919
where they're perceived by a receptor um

734
00:32:17,159 --> 00:32:22,399
called Step R1 um which turns on the

735
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:24,679
production of a downstream signal called

736
00:32:22,398 --> 00:32:27,398
set Downstream really great naming

737
00:32:24,679 --> 00:32:31,600
scheme here um which moves back down

738
00:32:27,398 --> 00:32:34,678
from the Shoot To The Roots um and

739
00:32:31,599 --> 00:32:37,798
influences um nitrogen foraging

740
00:32:34,679 --> 00:32:40,480
responses including uh U regulation of

741
00:32:37,798 --> 00:32:41,960
nitrogen uptake Transporters as well as

742
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:45,599
increased root

743
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:47,639
branching um in in places where there's

744
00:32:45,599 --> 00:32:50,599
High nitrogen and not where there's low

745
00:32:47,638 --> 00:32:53,000
nitrogen and so our idea was that we

746
00:32:50,599 --> 00:32:56,398
could actually plug in to the signaling

747
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:58,398
system to um learn about when plants are

748
00:32:56,398 --> 00:33:01,839
experiencing below ground nitrogen

749
00:32:58,398 --> 00:33:04,599
stress by seeing the output of this lowr

750
00:33:01,839 --> 00:33:06,519
signal in the shoot um and then actually

751
00:33:04,599 --> 00:33:08,199
reprogram the activation of the

752
00:33:06,519 --> 00:33:10,759
signaling system to turn on in response

753
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:12,480
to other below ground stresses um and so

754
00:33:10,759 --> 00:33:15,798
this is a huge collaborative project and

755
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:17,319
these are the main major um posto and

756
00:33:15,798 --> 00:33:21,720
grad students have been leading this

757
00:33:17,319 --> 00:33:26,599
work um across my lab cjan Le's lab um

758
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:30,200
AB st's lab and Mark Bin's

759
00:33:26,599 --> 00:33:34,079
lab um and so what we've done is we've

760
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:36,038
created um these reporter plants um that

761
00:33:34,079 --> 00:33:38,599
tell us when step Downstream is turned

762
00:33:36,038 --> 00:33:41,119
on so that's F us when steps have moved

763
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:44,519
um and turned on the response uh by

764
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:47,079
turning on a ruby reporter so this is a

765
00:33:44,519 --> 00:33:49,798
pigmentation reporter in tomato plants

766
00:33:47,079 --> 00:33:52,638
under low nitrogen you can see it's um

767
00:33:49,798 --> 00:33:54,519
really nicely expressed in the FL the

768
00:33:52,638 --> 00:33:56,798
flanking Flo region where it's then

769
00:33:54,519 --> 00:33:58,798
going to produce a downstream signal

770
00:33:56,798 --> 00:34:02,038
that moves back from through and we've

771
00:33:58,798 --> 00:34:04,038
also made a fluorescent lines in Abid

772
00:34:02,038 --> 00:34:06,440
opsis to look at a more quantitative

773
00:34:04,038 --> 00:34:09,398
response of this

774
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:11,119
process um and so this is the exciting

775
00:34:09,398 --> 00:34:13,838
kind of new data coming out of the lab

776
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:15,838
where the plants actually work um and so

777
00:34:13,838 --> 00:34:19,320
up here is wild type tomato and down

778
00:34:15,838 --> 00:34:22,519
here are these Ru lines um under 13 days

779
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:25,000
of nitrogen deprivation um and so a grad

780
00:34:22,519 --> 00:34:28,519
student in Abes lab Jacob Belding has

781
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:31,358
actually Quantified um using a really

782
00:34:28,519 --> 00:34:33,519
simple image processing um pipeline that

783
00:34:31,358 --> 00:34:37,039
he developed the response of these Ruby

784
00:34:33,519 --> 00:34:39,480
lines under low nitrogen um over time

785
00:34:37,039 --> 00:34:41,119
versus wild typ plant and the cool thing

786
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:43,559
here is that you actually start seeing a

787
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:46,639
significant response within days of low

788
00:34:43,559 --> 00:34:48,679
nitrogen treatment which is way before

789
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:50,200
um any grower is going to see that with

790
00:34:48,679 --> 00:34:51,679
the yellowing of leaves and the loss

791
00:34:50,199 --> 00:34:54,358
productivity of their plant so we think

792
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:57,320
we have this early alarm system to help

793
00:34:54,358 --> 00:34:59,719
people um manage their plants that can

794
00:34:57,320 --> 00:35:03,000
then be adapted to many different below

795
00:34:59,719 --> 00:35:04,719
ground inputs that are hard to manage um

796
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:06,480
and so we've also built this in a rabid

797
00:35:04,719 --> 00:35:10,199
opsis with fluorescent reporters where

798
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:12,599
you see the kinetics are quite fast so

799
00:35:10,199 --> 00:35:15,199
within six hours of low nitrogen

800
00:35:12,599 --> 00:35:16,160
treatment we see um this reporter

801
00:35:15,199 --> 00:35:19,480
turning

802
00:35:16,159 --> 00:35:21,358
on um I thought this is quite a rapid

803
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:23,599
response and now the big question is

804
00:35:21,358 --> 00:35:25,319
when does it actually turn off like so

805
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:27,079
if you apply nitrogen can you turn the

806
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:28,280
signal back off and use it throughout

807
00:35:27,079 --> 00:35:30,599
the season

808
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:33,079
um and so we'll be getting into these uh

809
00:35:30,599 --> 00:35:35,880
Messier questions in real field

810
00:35:33,079 --> 00:35:37,560
environments as well as in the lab um so

811
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:40,599
we have plants that are actually uh

812
00:35:37,559 --> 00:35:42,480
started already in uh Tucson Arizona and

813
00:35:40,599 --> 00:35:44,000
they're going to go out to Maricopa and

814
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:47,079
then another set of plants that are

815
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:49,639
going to be um here in Aurora New York

816
00:35:47,079 --> 00:35:54,119
growing amongst corn fields so this is

817
00:35:49,639 --> 00:35:56,679
really um really cool to see work from

818
00:35:54,119 --> 00:35:58,800
our lab going out into the real world to

819
00:35:56,679 --> 00:36:00,799
be tested well the quote unquote real

820
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:03,519
world the research environment but still

821
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:05,839
the field to be tested and then again

822
00:36:03,519 --> 00:36:07,239
the next step is really to see the what

823
00:36:05,838 --> 00:36:09,519
extent can this communication be

824
00:36:07,239 --> 00:36:13,000
reprogrammed to tell us about other

825
00:36:09,519 --> 00:36:15,719
below ground um events that are really

826
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:18,719
hard to monitor like throughout

827
00:36:15,719 --> 00:36:20,879
inages um okay I think I

828
00:36:18,719 --> 00:36:24,039
have four

829
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:26,800
minutes so I'll tell you about um I'll

830
00:36:24,039 --> 00:36:29,318
end with actually the first grafting

831
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:30,839
phenomenon that brought me into grafting

832
00:36:29,318 --> 00:36:33,960
um and this is the phenomenon of

833
00:36:30,838 --> 00:36:36,078
grafting induced Vigor um where when you

834
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:37,679
graft to a hybrid root stock an inner

835
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:41,000
specific hybrid root stock you get this

836
00:36:37,679 --> 00:36:44,919
boost in vegetative and reproductive um

837
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:47,199
output that increases yield and so um

838
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:49,559
the commercial root stocks are typically

839
00:36:47,199 --> 00:36:51,719
formed through these crosses between

840
00:36:49,559 --> 00:36:55,039
domesticated tomato and a green fruited

841
00:36:51,719 --> 00:36:57,118
tomato called sanum hites um and one of

842
00:36:55,039 --> 00:36:59,800
the most popular commercial root stocks

843
00:36:57,119 --> 00:37:03,039
that we in our research as well is Max

844
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:07,318
aort Max for short um and so when you

845
00:37:03,039 --> 00:37:10,079
graft to Max support um the domesticated

846
00:37:07,318 --> 00:37:12,800
tomato shoot system has this huge boost

847
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:14,318
um in its growth and so here's just the

848
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:16,400
increase in biomass that you get when

849
00:37:14,318 --> 00:37:18,358
you graft a Max support that then

850
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:20,800
influences an increase in yield and

851
00:37:18,358 --> 00:37:22,279
that's um a large reason for why the

852
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:25,039
this grafting is used in tomato

853
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:27,000
production in addition to atic and bi

854
00:37:25,039 --> 00:37:28,639
stress tolerance and so a really cool

855
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:31,358
thing with this phenomenon is that it's

856
00:37:28,639 --> 00:37:33,199
highly reputable across environments as

857
00:37:31,358 --> 00:37:36,199
so these are greenhouse growth chamber

858
00:37:33,199 --> 00:37:38,399
and multiple field studies showing that

859
00:37:36,199 --> 00:37:40,838
the max support root stock really

860
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:44,160
increases uh vegetative biomass and

861
00:37:40,838 --> 00:37:46,159
yield across environments which is uh

862
00:37:44,159 --> 00:37:49,960
not common in biology to find something

863
00:37:46,159 --> 00:37:52,039
that repeats across across environments

864
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:53,720
um so one of the questions um that I

865
00:37:52,039 --> 00:37:55,440
actually started out asking is whether

866
00:37:53,719 --> 00:37:58,399
it's really the hybrid state of the root

867
00:37:55,440 --> 00:38:00,519
system that's increasing the biomass of

868
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:04,079
the choot um and so what I did is I

869
00:38:00,519 --> 00:38:06,559
compared yield in a um domesticated

870
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:11,039
tomato grafted to a a

871
00:38:06,559 --> 00:38:13,239
hites um root stock versus a hybrid an

872
00:38:11,039 --> 00:38:16,800
F1 hybrid that I made with this hites

873
00:38:13,239 --> 00:38:18,479
cross to M82 and I compared that to the

874
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:21,200
influence of Max of for root stocks and

875
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:24,240
so what I saw is that um it's really the

876
00:38:21,199 --> 00:38:26,399
hybrid state that boo sealed but also my

877
00:38:24,239 --> 00:38:29,318
random hybrid that I made just because

878
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:31,800
the seeds were available in the lab um

879
00:38:29,318 --> 00:38:33,639
performs uh pretty similarly to one of

880
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:34,880
the top performing commercial lines and

881
00:38:33,639 --> 00:38:37,679
that's

882
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:39,559
because I think we're growing these in

883
00:38:37,679 --> 00:38:42,519
field conditions and a lot of root stock

884
00:38:39,559 --> 00:38:46,799
breeding is um targeted to control

885
00:38:42,519 --> 00:38:49,199
agricultural environments um and so uh

886
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:51,079
the very first grant in the lab um that

887
00:38:49,199 --> 00:38:53,598
we got was a hatch Grant to look at

888
00:38:51,079 --> 00:38:56,560
whether we can um identify other root

889
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:58,359
stocks that are beneficial for um

890
00:38:56,559 --> 00:39:00,759
outdoor New York State growing

891
00:38:58,358 --> 00:39:02,519
environments and so we made 30 different

892
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:05,720
um hybrid root stocks with different

893
00:39:02,519 --> 00:39:07,519
habites ecotypes and grew these in high

894
00:39:05,719 --> 00:39:12,239
tunnels in Freeville so this is a very

895
00:39:07,519 --> 00:39:14,880
popular way to um uh grow tomatoes near

896
00:39:12,239 --> 00:39:17,000
here um and pretty much any Farmers

897
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:18,680
Market tomato that's available earlier

898
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:20,800
in the season or later in the season is

899
00:39:18,679 --> 00:39:23,799
likely harvested from one of these high

900
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:26,480
tunnels um and we found that many of our

901
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:29,079
experimental root stocks marketing green

902
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:31,159
um perform well to some top commercial

903
00:39:29,079 --> 00:39:34,400
root stocks or sometimes even a little

904
00:39:31,159 --> 00:39:36,639
bit better and so uh this is another

905
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:38,680
example of us going you know really out

906
00:39:36,639 --> 00:39:40,879
into the real world where we were able

907
00:39:38,679 --> 00:39:43,480
to take our top performing root stocks

908
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:47,519
test them out at a major um

909
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:52,400
production site um two hours from here

910
00:39:47,519 --> 00:39:54,639
um so Zade cck uh welcomed us and our

911
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:56,760
crazy tomatoes and we didn't get a

912
00:39:54,639 --> 00:39:57,960
quantitative measure of whether or not

913
00:39:56,760 --> 00:40:00,960
they lik them

914
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:02,639
but this is a quote wow they're

915
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:05,760
significantly taller and healthier than

916
00:40:02,639 --> 00:40:07,719
the non-grafted s in the ttle um and so

917
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:09,720
Tian is working on a more quantitative

918
00:40:07,719 --> 00:40:11,358
measure of you know what influences

919
00:40:09,719 --> 00:40:13,399
whether or not people use grafting in

920
00:40:11,358 --> 00:40:17,039
their in their farms and so she's

921
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:18,720
performing um a real uh intensive survey

922
00:40:17,039 --> 00:40:22,480
at these grower Expos which has been

923
00:40:18,719 --> 00:40:24,559
really fun to go to um and so just like

924
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:27,480
how the hyperides probably has untap

925
00:40:24,559 --> 00:40:29,920
potential for positively influencing um

926
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:32,400
um production and and the ability for

927
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:35,159
plants to perform uh nor is looking at

928
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:37,519
how other wild tomatoes are also

929
00:40:35,159 --> 00:40:40,239
influencing uh the

930
00:40:37,519 --> 00:40:43,880
performance of of tomatoes and so she's

931
00:40:40,239 --> 00:40:46,078
making a ton of other um hybrid crosses

932
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:47,640
to these different some of these

933
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:49,680
different not all of these but some of

934
00:40:47,639 --> 00:40:52,519
these different wild species that have

935
00:40:49,679 --> 00:40:54,719
Superior H stress capacity and seeing

936
00:40:52,519 --> 00:40:57,920
whether you can like rapidly adapt uh

937
00:40:54,719 --> 00:40:59,799
tomato to challenging environments

938
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:03,720
um so that's I think a really cool

939
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:07,480
Direction work um so to wrap up we

940
00:41:03,719 --> 00:41:09,239
have um a ton of awesome tools for the

941
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:12,199
spectrum of compatibility to

942
00:41:09,239 --> 00:41:13,959
incompatibility and alra compatibility

943
00:41:12,199 --> 00:41:18,399
and of course more questions than we

944
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:21,079
started with um and I have to thank the

945
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:22,960
lab again um for carving out these

946
00:41:21,079 --> 00:41:25,680
questions and leading the work

947
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:27,760
forward um our collaborators and people

948
00:41:25,679 --> 00:41:30,199
who really generously provided res

949
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:33,480
sources um I don't typically do this but

950
00:41:30,199 --> 00:41:35,759
because it's a 10e seminar my mentors um

951
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:37,960
especially Adrien rer the head of my

952
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:41,599
mentorship committee who's made tons and

953
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:46,039
tons of time for me um during the last

954
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:48,240
many years um and then funding uh

955
00:41:46,039 --> 00:41:50,759
without which none of this would happen

956
00:41:48,239 --> 00:41:55,000
so hopefully funding

957
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:55,000
continues and that's it yeah I'll take

958
00:41:55,239 --> 00:41:59,838
questions uh is there a relation ship

959
00:41:58,159 --> 00:42:03,799
between

960
00:41:59,838 --> 00:42:07,719
um how whether you can recover hybrid F1

961
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:11,839
hybrids easy easily and

962
00:42:07,719 --> 00:42:14,639
graph compatibility I know like Peli and

963
00:42:11,838 --> 00:42:16,838
htis are at the kind of that tail end

964
00:42:14,639 --> 00:42:19,558
where you don't need to do certain like

965
00:42:16,838 --> 00:42:22,078
embryo rescue and that kind of stuff to

966
00:42:19,559 --> 00:42:24,160
right yeah so um is reproductive

967
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:27,400
compatibility an indicator for graph

968
00:42:24,159 --> 00:42:31,399
compatibility and no it's not um so

969
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:33,318
there's a really cool um study where um

970
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:36,720
a group in Germany actually overcame

971
00:42:33,318 --> 00:42:39,838
reproductive barriers between to um the

972
00:42:36,719 --> 00:42:42,358
kosana species through grasing so they

973
00:42:39,838 --> 00:42:44,719
uh were able to fuse the genomes of the

974
00:42:42,358 --> 00:42:47,920
of the nuclei basically into one new

975
00:42:44,719 --> 00:42:49,959
alop poly pled individual um That Could

976
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:52,838
set seed uh so like the graph

977
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:55,679
compatibility is much much broader than

978
00:42:52,838 --> 00:42:59,119
reproductive compatibility is that that

979
00:42:55,679 --> 00:42:59,118
showed us at least it's really cool

980
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:05,519
how was Max originally selected given

981
00:43:03,318 --> 00:43:08,199
that hyperides seems to be almost as

982
00:43:05,519 --> 00:43:10,239
good is there like oh like other hites I

983
00:43:08,199 --> 00:43:12,799
think that there's a suite of other

984
00:43:10,239 --> 00:43:15,519
traits that are probably highly relevant

985
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:17,960
to controlled agricultural

986
00:43:15,519 --> 00:43:21,599
environments um including probably

987
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:25,119
stacking of disease um traits in

988
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:26,838
addition to its ability to um promote

989
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:28,440
that grafting induc bigger phenotype

990
00:43:26,838 --> 00:43:30,480
because it is is one of the most

991
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:33,159
invigorating root stocks that we've

992
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:35,920
evaluated and we've looked at many so

993
00:43:33,159 --> 00:43:39,000
it's definitely like a Surefire way to

994
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:40,639
increase um vegetative and reproductive

995
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,960
biomas which can be a problem sometimes

996
00:43:40,639 --> 00:43:46,000
people have to like it takes a lot more

997
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:46,000
maintenance but keep the plants in

998
00:43:55,358 --> 00:44:04,039
check I was just think that is it a

999
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:04,040
two IM response

1000
00:44:04,199 --> 00:44:12,558
supression process or it's the very

1001
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:16,199
beginning why is it to overcome that

1002
00:44:12,559 --> 00:44:18,280
it's the developmental

1003
00:44:16,199 --> 00:44:20,799
process yeah that's such a great

1004
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:23,760
question and I think that's right on

1005
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:27,640
Sam's mind is like what which part's

1006
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:29,200
active um in allowing plants to grasp um

1007
00:44:27,639 --> 00:44:32,279
and whether it's like an active process

1008
00:44:29,199 --> 00:44:35,838
to be able to graph or an active

1009
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:39,440
rejection of incompatible graphs um so

1010
00:44:35,838 --> 00:44:41,759
we don't know but but we'll know in a

1011
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:41,760
couple of

1012
00:44:44,599 --> 00:44:50,119
years um so I don't really know anything

1013
00:44:47,239 --> 00:44:51,838
about plant crafting but in fungi there

1014
00:44:50,119 --> 00:44:54,559
like some there can be some

1015
00:44:51,838 --> 00:44:57,599
interspecific fusion but like there are

1016
00:44:54,559 --> 00:44:59,880
lots of strains of the same species that

1017
00:44:57,599 --> 00:45:03,440
don't talk to each other and that has

1018
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:05,680
really helped in finding these like uh

1019
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:07,760
immune response mechanisms and I'm

1020
00:45:05,679 --> 00:45:10,558
wondering if there are like in plants if

1021
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:13,000
like there are different isolates of

1022
00:45:10,559 --> 00:45:14,720
like tomato that maybe are in the same

1023
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:16,719
species or or separate species but like

1024
00:45:14,719 --> 00:45:18,598
don't talk to each other at all or don't

1025
00:45:16,719 --> 00:45:20,759
don't pass the v test or whatever that

1026
00:45:18,599 --> 00:45:23,280
you could maybe use to help get at some

1027
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:24,800
of that immune response questions yeah

1028
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:28,960
that's a great question we were thinking

1029
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:31,119
about maybe um ingression lines where

1030
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:32,920
you have just chunks of like a really

1031
00:45:31,119 --> 00:45:38,240
distant species that could help with

1032
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:41,318
mapping the genetics of it um but tomato

1033
00:45:38,239 --> 00:45:44,358
graphs pretty well to like the wild Bel

1034
00:45:41,318 --> 00:45:48,318
that we've tested so far so but there

1035
00:45:44,358 --> 00:45:50,880
are examples in puber cucurbit um so

1036
00:45:48,318 --> 00:45:53,960
cucurbit where there's um yeah more

1037
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:58,039
distinct incompatibilities within a

1038
00:45:53,960 --> 00:46:00,480
species we should look at and try

1039
00:45:58,039 --> 00:46:00,480
um

1040
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:07,318
adventurous how adaptable do you think

1041
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:10,720
that nitrogen reporter plant could be to

1042
00:46:07,318 --> 00:46:14,358
like remote sensing via uavs we're gonna

1043
00:46:10,719 --> 00:46:17,199
test it out yeah so there's um a drone

1044
00:46:14,358 --> 00:46:21,838
that will like fly the over the Maricopa

1045
00:46:17,199 --> 00:46:25,199
fields and Aurora Fields we'll see I'm

1046
00:46:21,838 --> 00:46:30,599
like a detailed phenotyper so I'm a

1047
00:46:25,199 --> 00:46:30,598
little skeptical but field people aren't

1048
00:46:31,358 --> 00:46:36,358
so there any parallels to this to like

1049
00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:40,680
parasitic plants yeah

1050
00:46:36,358 --> 00:46:44,199
definitely useful tool to explore yeah

1051
00:46:40,679 --> 00:46:47,118
so um that's helped us kind of hone in

1052
00:46:44,199 --> 00:46:49,558
on some the next set of candidates that

1053
00:46:47,119 --> 00:46:51,318
might be interesting in those networks

1054
00:46:49,559 --> 00:46:54,359
um so there's these

1055
00:46:51,318 --> 00:46:56,599
LBD there's a lot of these Lal boundary

1056
00:46:54,358 --> 00:46:59,239
domain genes but um there are ones that

1057
00:46:56,599 --> 00:47:02,000
are essential for um post parasite

1058
00:46:59,239 --> 00:47:05,318
interactions in tomato that are also

1059
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:09,440
expressed in our data set so um they're

1060
00:47:05,318 --> 00:47:09,440
like high level candidates

1061
00:47:15,639 --> 00:47:21,159
yeah this has been a production of

1062
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:24,160
Cornell University on the web at

1063
00:47:21,159 --> 00:47:24,159
