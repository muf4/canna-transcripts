1
00:00:01,419 --> 00:00:07,240
you expect to for them to continue

2
00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:10,599
pretty well all the way through the

3
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:13,030
summer and you get really cool areas

4
00:00:10,599 --> 00:00:15,550
like new this card they just just keep

5
00:00:13,029 --> 00:00:20,350
going because it never gets too hot for

6
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:24,460
them well that's how I see it anyway the

7
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:27,310
next thing run a production well oh one

8
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:32,500
thing that has been asking I'll go back

9
00:00:27,309 --> 00:00:35,259
is that the terms day neutral tune

10
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:39,158
barring what do they mean well they

11
00:00:35,259 --> 00:00:41,228
neutral supposedly means that the plants

12
00:00:39,158 --> 00:00:44,228
are in different today length but we can

13
00:00:41,228 --> 00:00:46,359
see that you have to get up to the

14
00:00:44,228 --> 00:00:49,238
maximum temperatures before you can see

15
00:00:46,359 --> 00:00:52,959
any difference so that has come caused

16
00:00:49,238 --> 00:00:55,088
confusion in the in the terminology but

17
00:00:52,959 --> 00:00:57,190
just think of it in terms of its the

18
00:00:55,088 --> 00:01:00,039
maximum temperature which then initiate

19
00:00:57,189 --> 00:01:03,218
and and then how they react to the day

20
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:08,019
length okay run a production

21
00:01:03,219 --> 00:01:10,930
well runners produce are produced more

22
00:01:08,019 --> 00:01:12,670
at higher temperatures more in longer

23
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:15,969
day lengths they are very daily

24
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:18,219
insensitive day neutrals tend to have

25
00:01:15,968 --> 00:01:19,809
less than June bearing varieties purely

26
00:01:18,218 --> 00:01:22,449
and simply because they're spending the

27
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:27,939
effort producing fruit rather than

28
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:30,998
producing runners and to put on top of

29
00:01:27,938 --> 00:01:33,879
it its confounded by the ability to grow

30
00:01:30,998 --> 00:01:37,209
in short days basically when you look at

31
00:01:33,879 --> 00:01:39,849
the strawberry varieties that are around

32
00:01:37,209 --> 00:01:42,149
in North America there are kind of two

33
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:44,709
types there are the California and

34
00:01:42,149 --> 00:01:47,679
Florida varieties which have been

35
00:01:44,709 --> 00:01:51,849
genetically and have used germ plasm

36
00:01:47,679 --> 00:01:54,990
which has enabled those varieties to

37
00:01:51,849 --> 00:01:57,849
grow very successfully in short days and

38
00:01:54,989 --> 00:02:01,239
then the northern varieties which go

39
00:01:57,849 --> 00:02:03,818
dormant in short days as a reaction to

40
00:02:01,239 --> 00:02:06,280
well it's winter we need to get cold

41
00:02:03,819 --> 00:02:09,399
resistance we need to go to sleep and

42
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:11,949
they go dormant and

43
00:02:09,399 --> 00:02:14,560
down here in Florida you bring northern

44
00:02:11,949 --> 00:02:16,328
varieties down here they literally stay

45
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,900
dormant even though it's big enough to

46
00:02:16,329 --> 00:02:19,450
ward

47
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:22,120
a bit it's warm enough to grow and the

48
00:02:19,449 --> 00:02:24,369
Florida and California growth varieties

49
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:26,438
grow very successfully

50
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:29,319
similarly the California Florida

51
00:02:26,438 --> 00:02:31,620
varieties will grow up in our area in

52
00:02:29,318 --> 00:02:36,839
the northern areas but they tend to be

53
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:39,969
have problems with winter hardiness so

54
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:42,370
probably the most good example of what

55
00:02:39,969 --> 00:02:46,509
happens to run a production is this work

56
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:51,489
from Turner &amp; Company in 1984 where they

57
00:02:46,509 --> 00:02:53,769
put different June bearing and

58
00:02:51,489 --> 00:02:56,620
day-neutral varieties in growth chambers

59
00:02:53,769 --> 00:02:57,879
at different temperatures and on the

60
00:02:56,620 --> 00:03:00,700
left you can see the day/night

61
00:02:57,878 --> 00:03:03,818
temperatures they're looking at a four

62
00:03:00,699 --> 00:03:06,310
degree difference in practice I think in

63
00:03:03,818 --> 00:03:11,078
North America it's probably a day-night

64
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:13,979
difference of around 12 degrees and then

65
00:03:11,079 --> 00:03:18,189
they either grew them in short days or

66
00:03:13,979 --> 00:03:20,948
short days with a night interrupt this

67
00:03:18,189 --> 00:03:24,400
is a plant physiology technique that we

68
00:03:20,949 --> 00:03:27,699
use to imitate long days but if you give

69
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:30,129
them a short period of low light in the

70
00:03:27,699 --> 00:03:32,620
middle of the night the strawberries

71
00:03:30,128 --> 00:03:37,780
think they've had another day and it

72
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:39,789
acts as if they're there in long days

73
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:42,549
and that way you you've still got about

74
00:03:39,789 --> 00:03:45,400
the same amount amount of light energy

75
00:03:42,549 --> 00:03:49,000
involved but you've lengthened the day

76
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:53,109
from short to long and the short day

77
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:55,628
plants under June bearing plants and the

78
00:03:53,109 --> 00:03:58,419
short days didn't produce runners until

79
00:03:55,628 --> 00:04:01,030
they got warm when they had the night

80
00:03:58,419 --> 00:04:03,609
they put you into long days they

81
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:05,229
produced it much more but again you got

82
00:04:03,609 --> 00:04:08,560
the increase as the temperatures

83
00:04:05,229 --> 00:04:12,430
increased the day neutrals and the short

84
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:15,459
days produced more runners again a

85
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:17,739
little bit more and this I think is

86
00:04:15,459 --> 00:04:19,180
probably going back to that ability to

87
00:04:17,738 --> 00:04:22,509
grow in short days which they've

88
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:25,030
inherited from the California material

89
00:04:22,509 --> 00:04:27,819
and when you put the night interrupt you

90
00:04:25,029 --> 00:04:31,449
Ganga Ghat the same pattern but it kind

91
00:04:27,819 --> 00:04:33,310
of interesting to note that under the

92
00:04:31,449 --> 00:04:37,389
night interrupts the day neutrals had

93
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:42,269
less runners on average than the than

94
00:04:37,389 --> 00:04:45,399
the short day plans and so you know he

95
00:04:42,269 --> 00:04:47,579
this is the classical response of day

96
00:04:45,399 --> 00:04:51,669
neutrals high temperature long days I

97
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:53,979
know one grower in Ontario was growing

98
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:56,400
his own runners and he said well I'm not

99
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:59,500
getting very many at him I said well put

100
00:04:56,399 --> 00:05:01,839
a light night interrupts in and he did

101
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:04,449
and instead of getting five or six

102
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:06,339
runners think up twenty or thirty so you

103
00:05:04,449 --> 00:05:13,060
know that day length is crucial in terms

104
00:05:06,339 --> 00:05:16,869
of runner production so lastly heat

105
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:20,470
acclamation welcome this is the ability

106
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:24,040
of the plant to adapt to heat stress and

107
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:26,350
what have you there's relatively little

108
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:28,270
information out there on what happens in

109
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:32,560
strawberries but we do know that

110
00:05:28,269 --> 00:05:36,639
strawberries can acclimate and there are

111
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:40,120
some points here that I want to make one

112
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:42,430
is that they're able to acclimate and it

113
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:45,399
varies considerably between the species

114
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:47,590
and the variety and we have to remember

115
00:05:45,399 --> 00:05:50,409
that the cultivated strawberries made up

116
00:05:47,589 --> 00:05:52,299
of two original species The Virginian

117
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:55,930
from eastern North America and the

118
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:59,050
Chilean from Chile and the west coast of

119
00:05:55,930 --> 00:06:03,459
North America and so all sorts of things

120
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:06,060
happen different things but basically if

121
00:06:03,459 --> 00:06:08,169
we talk in terms of photosynthesis it's

122
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:10,959
interesting that you look in the

123
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:13,569
literature and they say that if you grow

124
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:18,250
the plants below about ten before you

125
00:06:13,569 --> 00:06:20,469
subject them to tests you get most

126
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:24,370
photosynthesis happening between 15 and

127
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:29,500
20 Celsius if on the other hand you grow

128
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:32,290
them at 20 to 30 degrees before you do

129
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:33,569
the tests you can move the optimum up to

130
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:37,260
25 C

131
00:06:33,569 --> 00:06:40,290
I recently was at a conference and there

132
00:06:37,259 --> 00:06:42,719
was a gentleman from from Switzerland

133
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:44,689
talking about how he tested it in the

134
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:48,090
field and he found that the

135
00:06:44,689 --> 00:06:51,120
photosynthesis in the field in his plots

136
00:06:48,089 --> 00:06:54,209
was the highest rate of furthest

137
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:57,180
photosynthesis was was at 30 Celsius

138
00:06:54,209 --> 00:07:01,289
which his current sort of higher than 2

139
00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:02,730
like certainly I'd been meant to to

140
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:06,750
think was what was happening

141
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:08,970
so obviously the plants are very

142
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:12,329
adaptable in terms of that and that's

143
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:14,100
nice if in terms of de neutrals if 30 is

144
00:07:12,329 --> 00:07:15,750
the maximum of photosynthesis it means

145
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:20,550
you get really high yields and high

146
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:23,490
temperatures then the other point that I

147
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:26,400
want want to do is some talk about is

148
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:29,490
his skin colour this is a comment that

149
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:32,609
came up in Ontario in terms of

150
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:34,769
acclamation we have Cavendish and you

151
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:39,389
get some summers where cavern issues

152
00:07:34,769 --> 00:07:43,969
nice read others where the skins gone

153
00:07:39,389 --> 00:07:46,589
pale as if call it albinism or whatever

154
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:50,910
and it makes it pale and it looks

155
00:07:46,589 --> 00:07:54,149
unmarketable what's happening well we

156
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:58,260
had some studies and we ran seascape and

157
00:07:54,149 --> 00:08:00,239
Honeoye in 12-hour days at two very

158
00:07:58,259 --> 00:08:04,889
different temperatures a 30 degree day

159
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:08,040
and 18 degree night 18 degree day and

160
00:08:04,889 --> 00:08:11,099
six degree night and the potted plants

161
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:14,220
up um we grew them in the growth

162
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:18,480
chambers from potting all the way

163
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:20,550
through to write fruit and we split them

164
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:22,590
up into three periods the first period

165
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:24,449
which was fun when we parted them up

166
00:08:22,589 --> 00:08:27,389
until they produce their first flowers

167
00:08:24,449 --> 00:08:30,180
the second period was from first flower

168
00:08:27,389 --> 00:08:33,389
to when the fruit fir the King Blas

169
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:37,139
fruit was white and then from white

170
00:08:33,389 --> 00:08:38,580
fruit to fully ripe so what we do is put

171
00:08:37,139 --> 00:08:40,799
them in high temperatures or low

172
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:42,740
temperatures and switch them around at

173
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:45,240
the different stages so you've got

174
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:46,639
plants that were always in high plants

175
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,960
that were always in low

176
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:49,789
and then plants that were switched

177
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:54,620
between high and low in the different

178
00:08:49,789 --> 00:08:56,569
combinations and at the end one of the

179
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:58,940
things that came about out of it was the

180
00:08:56,570 --> 00:09:03,650
observation of what had happened to the

181
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:07,220
skin color and it was kind of interested

182
00:09:03,649 --> 00:09:11,689
when you average them out and this shows

183
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:17,870
that the average is my representation of

184
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:20,660
the averages and cold days cool

185
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:21,320
temperatures when there was when the

186
00:09:20,659 --> 00:09:27,159
fruit was ripe

187
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:29,540
you saw nice red ripe fruit and often

188
00:09:27,159 --> 00:09:36,919
and if it was hot

189
00:09:29,539 --> 00:09:39,980
often the fruit went white that was at

190
00:09:36,919 --> 00:09:41,509
the ripe fruit stage when the middle

191
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:43,850
stage it really didn't matter too much

192
00:09:41,509 --> 00:09:46,490
but what was interesting was when we

193
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:51,200
went from potted till first flower and

194
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:53,960
we kept those under high temperatures we

195
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:58,430
never saw any album any of the white

196
00:09:53,960 --> 00:10:01,670
fruit and the right white skin at the

197
00:09:58,429 --> 00:10:05,750
ripe fruit stage whereas if they were

198
00:10:01,669 --> 00:10:08,659
cold kept in the cool when we got to the

199
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:16,279
right to the right fruit stage we saw a

200
00:10:08,659 --> 00:10:18,439
lot with good white fruit and for

201
00:10:16,279 --> 00:10:22,309
instance should you'd have high high and

202
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:26,540
high and those fruit were red whereas if

203
00:10:22,309 --> 00:10:27,139
you had low low and high that fruit was

204
00:10:26,539 --> 00:10:31,099
white

205
00:10:27,139 --> 00:10:35,720
so obviously the plant was adapting at

206
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:38,899
the very early stage in the growing

207
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:41,690
season to acclimate itself so that it

208
00:10:38,899 --> 00:10:44,870
was able to protect the fruit when it

209
00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:47,120
was right and so when we think of that

210
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:48,710
think about heat acclamation we have to

211
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:52,190
think about processes that are happening

212
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:54,410
a long time before so is it the cold

213
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:57,380
spring hot spring how's that gonna

214
00:10:54,409 --> 00:10:57,889
affect things anyway I've gone on long

215
00:10:57,379 --> 00:11:00,499
enough

216
00:10:57,889 --> 00:11:02,678
and there are some of the things that I

217
00:11:00,499 --> 00:11:05,480
think are important in terms of

218
00:11:02,678 --> 00:11:09,548
strawberry physiology in terms of de

219
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:13,339
neutrals around blabbered initiation

220
00:11:09,548 --> 00:11:15,558
running also has an effect and I think

221
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:18,699
we've only just started to understand

222
00:11:15,558 --> 00:11:21,048
how heat will affect the day neutrals

223
00:11:18,698 --> 00:11:23,748
there's one last thing you've got to

224
00:11:21,048 --> 00:11:26,539
remember is every variety will act

225
00:11:23,749 --> 00:11:28,699
differently from every other variety so

226
00:11:26,539 --> 00:11:31,568
you have to learn your varieties as you

227
00:11:28,698 --> 00:11:34,159
go through okay

228
00:11:31,568 --> 00:11:36,918
thank you very much Adam I think we'll

229
00:11:34,159 --> 00:11:39,738
hold questions to the end so that we can

230
00:11:36,918 --> 00:11:42,980
keep on track and so we're going to

231
00:11:39,739 --> 00:11:45,470

Association Pam hello how are you good

251
00:12:29,418 --> 00:12:32,688
afternoon everybody

252
00:12:30,409 --> 00:12:35,719
I've just been chatting away in the box

253
00:12:32,688 --> 00:12:37,698
there and I hope you're you're ready to

254
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:39,528
go on to a new presentation I'm talking

255
00:12:37,698 --> 00:12:41,599
about day-neutral strawberries not

256
00:12:39,528 --> 00:12:44,629
because I'm an expert at all but because

257
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:47,048
I do see on different varieties as I

258
00:12:44,629 --> 00:12:49,399
travel across the province and listen to

259
00:12:47,048 --> 00:12:51,588
presentations in other areas so I hope

260
00:12:49,399 --> 00:12:53,149
you feel free to comment on what I have

261
00:12:51,589 --> 00:12:57,199
to say about these varieties and that we

262
00:12:53,149 --> 00:12:59,269
all learned something first of all while

263
00:12:57,198 --> 00:13:01,068
Adam was talking about the terminology

264
00:12:59,269 --> 00:13:03,918
and did a good job of explaining how de

265
00:13:01,068 --> 00:13:06,159
neutrals work some of the the terms I

266
00:13:03,918 --> 00:13:09,438
might use I thought I would define

267
00:13:06,159 --> 00:13:11,269
strong day neutral for example would be

268
00:13:09,438 --> 00:13:13,490
something that

269
00:13:11,269 --> 00:13:16,189
seems to set more flower buds at higher

270
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:18,440
temperatures and a weekday neutral maybe

271
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:20,540
something that has gaps in productions

272
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:23,000
so I know Adam explained the real reason

273
00:13:20,539 --> 00:13:25,189
for that but this is how I perceive it

274
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,830
to be so I wanted you to have those

275
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:32,030
terms when handy when I'm referring to

276
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:33,950
them later in this talk I also thought

277
00:13:32,029 --> 00:13:35,899
I'd start with some examples of

278
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:38,060
day-neutral varieties from different

279
00:13:35,899 --> 00:13:41,329
breeding programs that I'm not going to

280
00:13:38,059 --> 00:13:43,669
talk about today tribute and Tristar

281
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:44,960
were two of the early day neutral

282
00:13:43,669 --> 00:13:46,849
varieties some of you may be familiar

283
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:49,700
with they were developed in the United

284
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:53,060
States the USDA for Eastern North

285
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:55,190
America so they truly are adapted to the

286
00:13:53,059 --> 00:13:57,979
Northeast but they're very vigorous

287
00:13:55,190 --> 00:14:00,230
plants and they have good yields the

288
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:02,300
fruit is generally much smaller than we

289
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:04,190
would find acceptable these days

290
00:14:02,299 --> 00:14:06,349
although they may still have a niche

291
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:08,150
market for certain growers and these

292
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:11,060
varieties tribute and tristar are

293
00:14:08,149 --> 00:14:13,970
available still from some plant growers

294
00:14:11,059 --> 00:14:15,409
and then I listed some of the older

295
00:14:13,970 --> 00:14:18,279
day-neutral varieties from the

296
00:14:15,409 --> 00:14:21,079
University of California they have had a

297
00:14:18,279 --> 00:14:22,789
long history of developing de neutrals

298
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:26,389
and you may have heard of some of these

299
00:14:22,789 --> 00:14:29,480
varieties like fern and Salva aromas

300
00:14:26,389 --> 00:14:32,750
which were very popular in their day but

301
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:34,490
are no longer widely grown and finally I

302
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:36,320
wanted to point out that there are

303
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:39,560
several plant breeding programs in

304
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:41,570
Europe with day-neutral varieties that

305
00:14:39,559 --> 00:14:44,149
make their way to North America

306
00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:46,550
typically a plant growers secures the

307
00:14:44,149 --> 00:14:49,429
rights to distribute these varieties in

308
00:14:46,549 --> 00:14:52,179
North America and so you'll see in in

309
00:14:49,429 --> 00:14:54,199
catalogs from different plant growers

310
00:14:52,179 --> 00:14:56,689
day-neutral varieties that have been

311
00:14:54,200 --> 00:15:03,500
developed in north america and may find

312
00:14:56,690 --> 00:15:07,190
a place here so what I'm going to do is

313
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:09,830
talk about the three most important

314
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:12,140
varieties that I see in North in Ontario

315
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:14,840
and then I'll talk about three

316
00:15:12,139 --> 00:15:18,379
relatively new varieties that we tested

317
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:20,990
last year so the first one and by far

318
00:15:18,379 --> 00:15:22,250
the most popular is seascape this one

319
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:23,740
was developed in the University of

320
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:25,419
California and

321
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:27,220
made its way to farmers fields in

322
00:15:25,419 --> 00:15:30,610
approximately 1991

323
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:32,440
it's a cross with Salva which is an

324
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:35,200
older day-neutral variety and Douglas

325
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:37,420
and seascape has been very popular for a

326
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:40,629
long time the fruit is good quality it's

327
00:15:37,419 --> 00:15:45,069
firm it's a medium long conic and shape

328
00:15:40,629 --> 00:15:47,320
bright red it produces the best yields

329
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:51,070
in August and early September in our

330
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:54,790
area and it's widely grown and the most

331
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:57,870
winter hardy variety that we have of the

332
00:15:54,789 --> 00:15:57,870
six that I'm talking about

333
00:15:59,769 --> 00:16:04,360
the fruit we know are flavorful but

334
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:06,250
recently more and more growers are

335
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:08,440
telling me that it does seem to develop

336
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:10,950
an intense and sometimes unpleasant

337
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:13,780
aroma in the heat of the summer and

338
00:16:10,950 --> 00:16:16,210
although I've never experienced seascape

339
00:16:13,779 --> 00:16:19,629
with an objective objectionable taste I

340
00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:21,129
still love to eat this fruit growers do

341
00:16:19,629 --> 00:16:24,429
told me that compared to some of the

342
00:16:21,129 --> 00:16:27,419
other varieties it's not as nice also

343
00:16:24,429 --> 00:16:27,419
you all summer long

344
00:16:28,169 --> 00:16:33,009
another problem with seascape is that

345
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:36,250
it's very susceptible to powdery mildew

346
00:16:33,009 --> 00:16:38,080
and this disease is not we're not used

347
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:40,090
to this disease on other June bearing

348
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:42,550
varieties for example we don't see it as

349
00:16:40,090 --> 00:16:45,370
often and on seascape not only does it

350
00:16:42,549 --> 00:16:49,089
attack the leaves which you can see in

351
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:52,299
the lower right here but it attacks the

352
00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:54,690
fruit and it attacks the blossom and so

353
00:16:52,299 --> 00:16:58,599
you can end up with smaller fruit and

354
00:16:54,690 --> 00:17:01,600
blossom abortion sometimes and seeds

355
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:04,120
that are very that arrow isn't working

356
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:07,000
seeds that are prominent on the fruit

357
00:17:04,119 --> 00:17:10,509
and some fruit cracking sometimes that

358
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:12,670
can be due to powdery mildew so it's

359
00:17:10,509 --> 00:17:14,709
very susceptible to mildew you need a

360
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:16,539
really good spray program to keep on top

361
00:17:14,709 --> 00:17:18,430
of it and we are limited in the

362
00:17:16,539 --> 00:17:22,559
fungicides that we can use at least in

363
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:22,560
in Canada for powdery mildew

364
00:17:25,279 --> 00:17:29,720
another problem with seascape it's very

365
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:34,490
susceptible to rain damage so although

366
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:37,039
it has high yields of nice large fruit

367
00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:38,779
often after rain growers have to go

368
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:41,690
through and throw away a lot of the

369
00:17:38,779 --> 00:17:45,170
fruit it's the skin just sort of melts

370
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:49,880
away after after a rain and the fruit is

371
00:17:45,170 --> 00:17:52,550
unmarketable a lot of varieties do this

372
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:55,190
but seascape does it quite badly and

373
00:17:52,549 --> 00:17:57,349
it's important to have a well shaped bed

374
00:17:55,190 --> 00:18:02,230
in a sloping bed to prevent some of that

375
00:17:57,349 --> 00:18:02,230
damage but but it is susceptible to rain

376
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:08,940
now throughout this talk I'm going to

377
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:11,370
show you some graphs of typical yield

378
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:12,660
curves of these day-neutral varieties in

379
00:18:11,369 --> 00:18:15,629
there in the first year after planting

380
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:18,060
and the graphs come from some data that

381
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:20,790
we collected this summer funded by the

382
00:18:18,059 --> 00:18:23,369
Ontario berry Growers Association we put

383
00:18:20,789 --> 00:18:25,859
out five varieties of day neutrals at a

384
00:18:23,369 --> 00:18:29,069
few different sites you can see on the

385
00:18:25,859 --> 00:18:31,500
map Bowmanville Woodstock Dunnville and

386
00:18:29,069 --> 00:18:34,409
Delhi and the graphs that I'm showing

387
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:39,210
you all come from this site here in

388
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:41,430
Woodstock which is a fairly fairly mild

389
00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:50,360
site compared to eastern and northern

390
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:54,000
Ontario so this was seascape harvest in

391
00:18:50,359 --> 00:18:56,279
2010 at my Woodstock site we had small

392
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,980
plots of five different varieties and

393
00:18:56,279 --> 00:19:00,569
harvest them twice a week all through

394
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:06,660
the season the plants were planted the

395
00:19:00,569 --> 00:19:08,639
first of May week one is July 20th so

396
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:13,080
that's almost began harvest and week

397
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:15,210
twelve was October the 7th so we

398
00:19:13,079 --> 00:19:19,109
harvested till almost or just after

399
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:20,850
Thanksgiving the other thing to notice

400
00:19:19,109 --> 00:19:23,250
you'll see the same in all these graphs

401
00:19:20,849 --> 00:19:26,730
that we we have the total marketable

402
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:28,380
yield unmarketable yield and then the

403
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:30,569
total yield so the total yield is your

404
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:32,640
blue line and then the brown line is

405
00:19:30,569 --> 00:19:35,129
what was unmarketable and marketable is

406
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:37,380
the purple you can see that seascape is

407
00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:42,150
a fairly early variety with very good

408
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:46,050
yields high yields particularly through

409
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:47,370
August and early September but and I

410
00:19:46,049 --> 00:19:50,069
don't think you'll see this on any of

411
00:19:47,369 --> 00:19:53,189
the other graphs the unmarketable yield

412
00:19:50,069 --> 00:19:55,500
is sometimes higher than the marketable

413
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:56,850
yield and that's not a very good thing

414
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:59,609
those berries could have been

415
00:19:56,849 --> 00:20:01,949
unmarketable because they were small or

416
00:19:59,609 --> 00:20:05,779
because they had rain damage or because

417
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:05,779
they were suffering from powdery mildew

418
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:16,779
yeah that was Canadian Thanksgiving okay

419
00:20:13,569 --> 00:20:20,259
so Albion is another very popular

420
00:20:16,779 --> 00:20:22,359
variety in Ontario most growers are our

421
00:20:20,259 --> 00:20:25,750
trying Albion and many growers have

422
00:20:22,359 --> 00:20:29,259
moved substantially away from seascape

423
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:31,690
too to Albion especially in the warmer

424
00:20:29,259 --> 00:20:34,599
parts of the province and the main

425
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:36,519
reason is quality Albion is a weak or

426
00:20:34,599 --> 00:20:39,399
moderate day-neutral the yields are not

427
00:20:36,519 --> 00:20:41,829
as high as seascape but the quality is

428
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:44,769
very good it's a conical fruit bright

429
00:20:41,829 --> 00:20:47,019
red and shiny the skin is not

430
00:20:44,769 --> 00:20:49,829
susceptible to bruising or rain damage

431
00:20:47,019 --> 00:20:53,589
and it has excellent excellent flavor

432
00:20:49,829 --> 00:20:56,019
also Albion is more tolerant to powdery

433
00:20:53,589 --> 00:21:02,589
mildew and more tolerant to spider mites

434
00:20:56,019 --> 00:21:05,859
than seascape I should show you this -

435
00:21:02,589 --> 00:21:07,539
this this habit I think is fairly unique

436
00:21:05,859 --> 00:21:13,119
to Albion where it ripens from the

437
00:21:07,539 --> 00:21:14,889
bottom the bottom up so these are some

438
00:21:13,119 --> 00:21:16,839
of the things we've observed with Albion

439
00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:19,420
Ontario very high percentage of

440
00:21:16,839 --> 00:21:22,329
marketable fruit even though the yields

441
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:26,590
are outstanding the the biggest drawback

442
00:21:22,329 --> 00:21:28,059
I guess - to Albion is well two

443
00:21:26,589 --> 00:21:31,509
drawbacks the yields are lower than

444
00:21:28,059 --> 00:21:34,440
seascape and winter hardiness could be a

445
00:21:31,509 --> 00:21:38,670
problem it's definitely not as Hardy as

446
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:42,009
seascape if you overwinter the planting

447
00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:45,130
most growers do overwinter day-neutral

448
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:47,619
plantings in Ontario and this is a field

449
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:50,890
of Albion taking it at the end of April

450
00:21:47,619 --> 00:21:55,919
and you can see that there are some some

451
00:21:50,890 --> 00:21:59,230
weak areas some areas with strong plants

452
00:21:55,920 --> 00:22:01,060
I'm trying to use this arrow sorry some

453
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:03,099
areas where the plants are stronger and

454
00:22:01,059 --> 00:22:04,629
then some areas up at the foreground

455
00:22:03,099 --> 00:22:06,639
here where the plants are a little bit

456
00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:10,930
weaker and they can recover from this

457
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:13,530
type of damage but but in the end it is

458
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:13,529
winter injury

459
00:22:16,789 --> 00:22:21,589
and we've noticed especially with Albion

460
00:22:19,339 --> 00:22:25,429
but without other varieties as well that

461
00:22:21,589 --> 00:22:29,179
after the winter rose in the centre of a

462
00:22:25,430 --> 00:22:31,070
bed tend to be vigorous and more larger

463
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:35,299
plants and less winter damaged than the

464
00:22:31,069 --> 00:22:37,369
rose on the outside edges near the edge

465
00:22:35,299 --> 00:22:39,200
of the bed and that's probably just due

466
00:22:37,369 --> 00:22:43,429
to a cold effect where there's more cold

467
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:45,710
coming into the bed from the edges these

468
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:48,230
plants do seem to recover quite well but

469
00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:53,690
they do we don't know what the effect of

470
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:55,730
sub-lethal winter injury could be so

471
00:22:53,690 --> 00:22:59,590
this is a graph of Albion harvest in

472
00:22:55,730 --> 00:23:02,000
2010 at that same site near Woodstock

473
00:22:59,589 --> 00:23:06,349
you can see that the peak of production

474
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:09,829
is later than seascape with week six

475
00:23:06,349 --> 00:23:13,129
being approximately August 23rd so a lot

476
00:23:09,829 --> 00:23:15,889
of that yield came in after after

477
00:23:13,130 --> 00:23:18,290
mid-august you can also see that the

478
00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:20,870
percent if you look at that purple line

479
00:23:18,289 --> 00:23:22,970
the unmarketable fruit not the percent

480
00:23:20,869 --> 00:23:25,250
but the amount of unmarketable fruit is

481
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:28,299
quite low and consistently low

482
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:28,299
throughout the season

483
00:23:34,869 --> 00:23:41,259
and this is some some data comparing the

484
00:23:38,769 --> 00:23:44,230
cultivar Albion to the cultivar seascape

485
00:23:41,259 --> 00:23:46,140
at one of the most northerly locations

486
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:48,490
in Ontario and new lists scred where

487
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:50,320
becky Hughes does research on

488
00:23:48,490 --> 00:23:52,569
strawberries and she shared this slide

489
00:23:50,319 --> 00:23:54,609
with me I thought you'd be interested to

490
00:23:52,569 --> 00:23:57,369
see because it gives you some some

491
00:23:54,609 --> 00:24:00,429
numbers to compare the the yields of

492
00:23:57,369 --> 00:24:02,469
Albion to seascape and I think also you

493
00:24:00,430 --> 00:24:05,190
can see the effect of winter injury on

494
00:24:02,470 --> 00:24:09,640
the marketable yield in the second year

495
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:12,940
Becky says that that winter between 2008

496
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:15,790
and 2009 I think was a fairly normal

497
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:18,308
winter there was 15% plant mortality in

498
00:24:15,789 --> 00:24:20,619
Albion after that winter so it's really

499
00:24:18,308 --> 00:24:23,410
not as bad as you would expect for a

500
00:24:20,619 --> 00:24:26,619
condition for a location as far north as

501
00:24:23,410 --> 00:24:28,900
new lists Kurt these plants would have

502
00:24:26,619 --> 00:24:31,689
been protected with straw and a floating

503
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:34,030
row cover for the winter but you can see

504
00:24:31,690 --> 00:24:36,190
that the yield the second year and the

505
00:24:34,029 --> 00:24:37,899
berry size the second year is is quite a

506
00:24:36,190 --> 00:24:40,740
bit smaller than it was the first year

507
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:40,740
for both those varieties

508
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:51,230
now the third variety that's still grown

509
00:24:49,009 --> 00:24:55,190
in Ontario to some extent although not a

510
00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:59,000
lot is Evie - this is a variety from the

511
00:24:55,190 --> 00:25:01,130
United Kingdom and people people like it

512
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:04,220
because the plants are vigorous the

513
00:25:01,130 --> 00:25:07,520
fruit is large it's light red and firm

514
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:09,529
it's fairly round I think that most

515
00:25:07,519 --> 00:25:11,720
growers really prefer to have the longer

516
00:25:09,529 --> 00:25:13,549
conical fruit if they're exporting or

517
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:16,430
not exporting if they're shipping their

518
00:25:13,549 --> 00:25:19,339
fruit to retail stores the flavor is

519
00:25:16,430 --> 00:25:21,410
sweet and it is somewhat earlier than

520
00:25:19,339 --> 00:25:26,720
seascape so those are the advantages of

521
00:25:21,410 --> 00:25:29,630
EB - however the fruit is too soft for

522
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:32,029
most for most markets off the farm and

523
00:25:29,630 --> 00:25:34,850
it is also very susceptible to rain

524
00:25:32,029 --> 00:25:37,250
damage so there's not much Evie - grown

525
00:25:34,849 --> 00:25:40,339
in Ontario we are looking forward to

526
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:45,220
testing some of the newer siblings from

527
00:25:40,339 --> 00:25:45,220
this line of the neutrals in the future

528
00:25:47,429 --> 00:25:51,839
so those were the three varieties that

529
00:25:49,229 --> 00:25:55,139
I've seen grown widely in Ontario

530
00:25:51,838 --> 00:25:56,729
seascape Albion a little bit of 82 and

531
00:25:55,138 --> 00:25:58,558
now I'll talk about the three new ones

532
00:25:56,729 --> 00:26:02,909
from California which are San Andreas

533
00:25:58,558 --> 00:26:06,388
Monterey and Portola San Andreas is a

534
00:26:02,909 --> 00:26:08,700
cross with Albion in the parentage it's

535
00:26:06,388 --> 00:26:12,238
a very large firm fruit with excellent

536
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:13,919
quality the shape is good its medium to

537
00:26:12,239 --> 00:26:16,769
long conic and it's very highly

538
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:19,799
symmetrical in shape which helps it look

539
00:26:16,769 --> 00:26:22,169
great in a basket it's similar in season

540
00:26:19,798 --> 00:26:24,588
to Albion and I think they selected it

541
00:26:22,169 --> 00:26:27,690
because yields are apparently higher

542
00:26:24,588 --> 00:26:33,418
than Albion or at least they were higher

543
00:26:27,690 --> 00:26:35,639
in California we notice that San Andreas

544
00:26:33,419 --> 00:26:40,229
is a very attractive berry it's got a

545
00:26:35,638 --> 00:26:43,408
nice large calyx good flavor it was very

546
00:26:40,229 --> 00:26:45,869
late for us but we've only tested it for

547
00:26:43,409 --> 00:26:48,389
one year in in a few locations in

548
00:26:45,868 --> 00:26:50,009
Ontario so there could be physiological

549
00:26:48,388 --> 00:26:53,398
reasons why it was late it was much

550
00:26:50,009 --> 00:26:55,950
later than Albion and it's supposed to

551
00:26:53,398 --> 00:26:57,598
come in the same season as Albion the

552
00:26:55,950 --> 00:26:59,609
plans for San Andreas were really

553
00:26:57,598 --> 00:27:01,229
vigorous and I could see them across the

554
00:26:59,608 --> 00:27:03,838
field because they're so disease

555
00:27:01,229 --> 00:27:06,028
resistant so where we could see powdery

556
00:27:03,838 --> 00:27:07,739
mildew and other leaf diseases on all

557
00:27:06,028 --> 00:27:10,348
the other varieties San Andreas was

558
00:27:07,739 --> 00:27:14,338
remarkably clean it is however are

559
00:27:10,348 --> 00:27:16,858
susceptible to botrytis and this is the

560
00:27:14,338 --> 00:27:19,588
yield curve for San Andreas just one

561
00:27:16,858 --> 00:27:22,408
year like I said of harvest in in

562
00:27:19,588 --> 00:27:25,200
southern Ontario it had very high yields

563
00:27:22,409 --> 00:27:28,019
but they didn't really start until the

564
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:30,058
end of August and early September and

565
00:27:28,019 --> 00:27:34,700
you can see that the unmarketable yield

566
00:27:30,058 --> 00:27:34,700
was fairly low and consistently low

567
00:27:37,079 --> 00:27:41,819
the third the second new cultivar out of

568
00:27:40,048 --> 00:27:44,929
California released at the same time

569
00:27:41,819 --> 00:27:50,308
also with Albion in the parentage is

570
00:27:44,929 --> 00:27:52,980
Monterey and this one is probably the

571
00:27:50,308 --> 00:27:55,019
most similar of the three to albion and

572
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:57,480
it was released also because it has

573
00:27:55,019 --> 00:28:00,359
apparently higher yields in Albion it's

574
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:07,079
got large red fruit kind of an orange e

575
00:28:00,359 --> 00:28:08,939
red fruit and in vigorous plants we

576
00:28:07,079 --> 00:28:11,278
noticed that the size and the yield of

577
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:13,889
this variety were good and that the

578
00:28:11,278 --> 00:28:15,599
flavor was good but the quality is not

579
00:28:13,888 --> 00:28:17,908
what we're used to if you've grown

580
00:28:15,599 --> 00:28:19,528
albion so the skin seems a little bit

581
00:28:17,909 --> 00:28:21,419
thinner it seems a little more

582
00:28:19,528 --> 00:28:24,028
susceptible to rain damage maybe a

583
00:28:21,419 --> 00:28:27,929
little more susceptible to leaf diseases

584
00:28:24,028 --> 00:28:30,388
and fruit rots still it's a fine variety

585
00:28:27,929 --> 00:28:33,989
if you can't get your hands on Albion I

586
00:28:30,388 --> 00:28:36,988
would give them onto Rea a try and this

587
00:28:33,989 --> 00:28:40,308
is the yield curve for Monterey earlier

588
00:28:36,989 --> 00:28:45,090
than some of the others we've seen and

589
00:28:40,308 --> 00:28:49,200
fairly productive with high yields and

590
00:28:45,089 --> 00:28:51,238
reasonably the unmarketable fruit is a

591
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:54,889
little bit higher than San Andreas and

592
00:28:51,239 --> 00:28:54,889
Albion but not terribly so

593
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:02,788
finally Portola another cross from the

594
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:05,639
University of California released at the

595
00:29:02,788 --> 00:29:07,440
same time it's it's touted as being a

596
00:29:05,638 --> 00:29:10,258
strong day-neutral which means you

597
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:11,909
wouldn't see so many gaps in production

598
00:29:10,259 --> 00:29:14,399
and you would expect it to come in a

599
00:29:11,909 --> 00:29:17,429
little bit earlier in Ontario which it

600
00:29:14,398 --> 00:29:20,788
does the fruit is a much orange or red

601
00:29:17,429 --> 00:29:23,038
orange or red than the others that it's

602
00:29:20,788 --> 00:29:26,730
a bit rounder in shape with a small

603
00:29:23,038 --> 00:29:29,669
calyx and we saw high early yields with

604
00:29:26,730 --> 00:29:32,069
Portola it is definitely an earlier

605
00:29:29,669 --> 00:29:36,840
berry than the other than most of the

606
00:29:32,069 --> 00:29:40,200
others the fruit does have a kind of an

607
00:29:36,839 --> 00:29:42,528
unusual color to it it's I don't know if

608
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:46,528
it's the gloss or the shine or the color

609
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:50,970
it wasn't so rain tolerant as albion and

610
00:29:46,528 --> 00:29:53,940
my students did not like the taste now

611
00:29:50,970 --> 00:29:55,919
they'd been spoiled on Albion I'm in

612
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:58,169
this slide I think shows it is easy to

613
00:29:55,919 --> 00:30:00,690
pick out the color and the appearance of

614
00:29:58,169 --> 00:30:03,090
Portola this is a basket of fruit with

615
00:30:00,690 --> 00:30:06,028
several varieties in the basket but you

616
00:30:03,089 --> 00:30:09,388
can see on the lower right that's where

617
00:30:06,028 --> 00:30:12,749
all the Portola are they are they're

618
00:30:09,388 --> 00:30:15,358
much orange er kind of duller an almost

619
00:30:12,749 --> 00:30:17,159
plastic in color but they would put up a

620
00:30:15,358 --> 00:30:23,999
very attractive pack for wholesale

621
00:30:17,159 --> 00:30:24,659
markets and this is the yield curve for

622
00:30:23,999 --> 00:30:28,319
Portola

623
00:30:24,659 --> 00:30:31,590
I think it has fairly fairly high

624
00:30:28,319 --> 00:30:33,898
unmarketable yields but also fairly high

625
00:30:31,589 --> 00:30:36,898
yields altogether and you can see that

626
00:30:33,898 --> 00:30:38,998
it was much earlier than than some of

627
00:30:36,898 --> 00:30:43,349
those other varieties coming in at week

628
00:30:38,999 --> 00:30:45,690
three which was third of August as

629
00:30:43,349 --> 00:30:48,079
opposed to week five and six for some of

630
00:30:45,690 --> 00:30:48,080
the others

631
00:30:52,299 --> 00:30:57,730
this graph is just one to show the size

632
00:30:55,480 --> 00:31:00,099
of the berries in these trials at this

633
00:30:57,730 --> 00:31:04,319
at this location throughout the summer I

634
00:31:00,099 --> 00:31:08,730
think the thing to notice here is that

635
00:31:04,319 --> 00:31:12,909
seascape had the smaller fruit and

636
00:31:08,730 --> 00:31:16,120
Albion Monterrey Portola we're all very

637
00:31:12,910 --> 00:31:19,029
similar in fruit size and the San

638
00:31:16,119 --> 00:31:25,839
Andreas may be a tiny bit bigger some

639
00:31:19,029 --> 00:31:27,519
times of the year so and I'm about ready

640
00:31:25,839 --> 00:31:29,769
to wrap up and maybe we'll have time for

641
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:32,440
some discussion but I hope I've given

642
00:31:29,769 --> 00:31:35,170
you some points on on choosing a variety

643
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:36,880
I think it's more than just yield for

644
00:31:35,170 --> 00:31:38,370
day neutrals although yield is still an

645
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:40,600
important consideration

646
00:31:38,369 --> 00:31:43,419
albian has really set the stage for

647
00:31:40,599 --> 00:31:46,179
flavor and people have turned to albion

648
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:48,130
away from seascape for that reason the

649
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:50,410
quality of fruit is important how much

650
00:31:48,130 --> 00:31:53,860
fruit are you going to throw away for

651
00:31:50,410 --> 00:31:55,630
poor quality or rain damage I think

652
00:31:53,859 --> 00:31:58,359
disease resistance is important if a

653
00:31:55,630 --> 00:31:59,590
variety is so susceptible to disease

654
00:31:58,359 --> 00:32:02,769
that you're going to have trouble

655
00:31:59,589 --> 00:32:06,369
controlling it with our limited toolbox

656
00:32:02,769 --> 00:32:08,379
and we'll have to see what happens with

657
00:32:06,369 --> 00:32:10,989
winter hardiness so seascape is

658
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:14,800
definitely a hardy or variety for most

659
00:32:10,990 --> 00:32:16,210
of Ontario more Hardy than Albion the

660
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:19,269
advantage to these new varieties

661
00:32:16,210 --> 00:32:21,549
Monterey Portola and San Andreas may be

662
00:32:19,269 --> 00:32:24,069
that they're a little more Hardy than

663
00:32:21,549 --> 00:32:28,740
Albion and we need some more experience

664
00:32:24,069 --> 00:32:31,210
in the Northeast to find that out and

665
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:34,120
this is just my favorite slide of

666
00:32:31,210 --> 00:32:37,660
somebody who day-neutral varieties in in

667
00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:40,089
Ontario and I'm really proud to work

668
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:42,360
with growers that grow such beautiful

669
00:32:40,089 --> 00:32:42,359
fruit

670
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:47,140
thank you very much Pam Adam if he'll

671
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:48,670
join us again if anyone has any

672
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:50,860
questions you're welcome to type them

673
00:32:48,670 --> 00:32:55,840
into the chat box and either of our

674
00:32:50,859 --> 00:33:01,049
speakers will reply while we're waiting

675
00:32:55,839 --> 00:33:04,240
for those I'm going to move to the end

676
00:33:01,049 --> 00:33:06,690
screen thank you all for joining us this

677
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:06,690
week

678
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:12,039
our second presentation will be next

679
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:14,019
week in the day-neutral strawberry

680
00:33:12,039 --> 00:33:16,000
miniseries we're going to be hearing

681
00:33:14,019 --> 00:33:18,369
about day-neutral growing systems for

682
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:20,440
mr. Simo and Perl who's the president of

683
00:33:18,369 --> 00:33:22,889
Nova fruit and we'll also be hearing

684
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:25,210
about fertility and fertigation from

685
00:33:22,890 --> 00:33:27,509
johns and straw from the University of

686
00:33:25,210 --> 00:33:27,509
Guelph

687
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:31,210
okay

688
00:33:32,829 --> 00:33:38,619
there is a question from Ian McGregor

689
00:33:36,190 --> 00:33:41,250
Pam how much earlier is evey to than

690
00:33:38,619 --> 00:33:41,250
seascape

691
00:33:48,549 --> 00:33:55,279
damn yeah oh yes I was typing the answer

692
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:59,270
but I guess I could answer it yes Mike

693
00:33:55,279 --> 00:34:01,279
yeah anyways Heidi and I I haven't

694
00:33:59,269 --> 00:34:03,379
compared them I think it's about a week

695
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:05,569
earlier to get into big bigger

696
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:08,630
production and I wonder if anyone else

697
00:34:05,569 --> 00:34:18,500
has experience with ev2 compared to

698
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:21,019
seascape also I'm interested in knowing

699
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:22,489
if who else has tried some of these

700
00:34:21,019 --> 00:34:26,539
newer varieties and what their

701
00:34:22,489 --> 00:34:28,129
experience is while we're waiting for

702
00:34:26,539 --> 00:34:30,079
people to weigh in on that Michele and

703
00:34:28,130 --> 00:34:31,909
Norbert have a question about varieties

704
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:42,349
that would be suited to Edmonton and the

705
00:34:31,909 --> 00:34:45,220
north the day neutrals would be suitable

706
00:34:42,349 --> 00:34:47,779
and there's a quite a large acreage of

707
00:34:45,219 --> 00:34:50,148
Daniels in Alberta and their husband for

708
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:56,600
a long time a lot of growers and growing

709
00:34:50,148 --> 00:34:58,219
fern burnin also seascape would be okay

710
00:34:56,599 --> 00:35:03,980
don't you think Adam I don't want to try

711
00:34:58,219 --> 00:35:08,349
yeah Rob black is on maybe Rob can tell

712
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:08,349
us what they're growing in Alberta

713
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:14,809
otherwise you look at the Jim Barris me

714
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:17,390
my standard devices you've got to try

715
00:35:14,809 --> 00:35:19,880
them and see I know that our recent

716
00:35:17,389 --> 00:35:25,190
variety of seascape and serenity did

717
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:29,440
very well in Charles Herman in sapphire

718
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:29,440
sapphire yeah sorry I'm getting all the

719
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:46,360
you know you've got to try try them in

720
00:35:39,650 --> 00:35:46,360
your environment thank you David

721
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:51,838
David commented David Handley from Maine

722
00:35:49,769 --> 00:35:55,079
has commented that eb2 was seven to ten

723
00:35:51,838 --> 00:35:56,818
days earlier than seascape in some years

724
00:35:55,079 --> 00:36:00,990
and then in others only three to five

725
00:35:56,818 --> 00:36:03,269
days thank you rob rob has a lot of

726
00:36:00,989 --> 00:36:05,879
experience with day neutrals in Alberta

727
00:36:03,269 --> 00:36:13,739
and so that's confirming that it would

728
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:15,630
be a good one to try but it also depends

729
00:36:13,739 --> 00:36:17,189
to the people up near Edmonton whether

730
00:36:15,630 --> 00:36:20,670
you're going to grow them as an annual

731
00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:21,150
or whether you want to have them for two

732
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:23,039
years

733
00:36:21,150 --> 00:36:24,809
well there's been a guess yeah but

734
00:36:23,039 --> 00:36:27,449
there's been some very good research out

735
00:36:24,809 --> 00:36:30,269
of Saskatchewan that has shown that if

736
00:36:27,449 --> 00:36:31,558
you cover them with plastic you can get

737
00:36:30,269 --> 00:36:32,849
them through you can get most

738
00:36:31,559 --> 00:36:37,859
strawberries through the winter very

739
00:36:32,849 --> 00:36:39,180
very easily in those climates yeah

740
00:36:37,858 --> 00:36:41,159
that's what Becky's doing in new

741
00:36:39,179 --> 00:36:47,338
less-good covering with straw and

742
00:36:41,159 --> 00:36:50,279
plastic worst in row cover growing

743
00:36:47,338 --> 00:36:52,789
systems of day neutrals and high tunnels

744
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:55,048
oh it's plastic

745
00:36:52,789 --> 00:37:00,000
Laura's asking is it plastic or rock oh

746
00:36:55,048 --> 00:37:03,659
it's plastic not round cover album I

747
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:06,920
think Becky's using real cover yeah but

748
00:37:03,659 --> 00:37:11,578
the research was done on plastic

749
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:15,690
internals I tend to my feeling on

750
00:37:11,579 --> 00:37:17,400
tunnels is that in most areas it's not

751
00:37:15,690 --> 00:37:22,619
going to be economic because of the

752
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:25,200
price you get for the berries but temper

753
00:37:22,619 --> 00:37:30,599
that weed I think if you are in an area

754
00:37:25,199 --> 00:37:35,368
where in in the north where you have a

755
00:37:30,599 --> 00:37:38,940
very short growing season the day new

756
00:37:35,369 --> 00:37:40,769
tunnels can make could be very

757
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:42,900
profitable and we're doing some research

758
00:37:40,769 --> 00:37:44,480
with Becky it's got the day neutrals

759
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:48,260
under tunnels now a new listing

760
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:51,039
and I think that in that kind of area it

761
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:53,480
could be a very profitable enterprise

762
00:37:51,039 --> 00:37:56,210
but suddenly come down into southern

763
00:37:53,480 --> 00:38:01,088
Ontario and anywhere dancer further than

764
00:37:56,210 --> 00:38:03,800
that the economics aren't going to work

765
00:38:01,088 --> 00:38:06,828
having said that I here in Florida

766
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:09,980
they're starting to put tunnels up like

767
00:38:06,829 --> 00:38:13,480
crazy because in the winter they get

768
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:16,519
very very good high early season yields

769
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:18,769
but then again that's you know cool

770
00:38:16,519 --> 00:38:20,690
growing season and that's pushing the

771
00:38:18,769 --> 00:38:24,019
temperature up when you get into

772
00:38:20,690 --> 00:38:25,760
northern areas and you have tunnels the

773
00:38:24,019 --> 00:38:30,619
temperature in the tunnels is higher and

774
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:36,369
it surprises the the yield and the

775
00:38:30,619 --> 00:38:36,369
flyboard initiation so I think it's very

776
00:38:37,059 --> 00:38:42,460
regionally sensitive if you like as to

777
00:38:39,679 --> 00:38:44,989
where the tunnels will work or white

778
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:47,150
there's a question from John brand

779
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:54,919
Strada best varieties for southern Ohio

780
00:38:47,150 --> 00:39:00,530
Heat he's asking well I would suggest

781
00:38:54,920 --> 00:39:06,940
I'll be in for sure because seascape

782
00:39:00,530 --> 00:39:06,940
does tend to develop those flavors

783
00:39:07,239 --> 00:39:13,309
really all flavors but less flavorful

784
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:18,309
than Albion but we haven't got much

785
00:39:13,309 --> 00:39:24,409
higher in southern note on my Ohio I

786
00:39:18,309 --> 00:39:26,210
suspect it will could we didn't see much

787
00:39:24,409 --> 00:39:29,568
of a gap this year when it was quite hot

788
00:39:26,210 --> 00:39:31,970
but I guess it wasn't as hard as it

789
00:39:29,568 --> 00:39:34,880
depends when when when the heat is BAM

790
00:39:31,969 --> 00:39:36,980
if the heats early it will gap if it's

791
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:39,920
the heats later it was already set it's

792
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:43,869
laberd's and if there's a gap it'll sort

793
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:43,869
of catch itself back up over the winter

794
00:39:43,929 --> 00:39:48,309
so

795
00:39:46,090 --> 00:39:52,829
yeah in terms of food quality I think

796
00:39:48,309 --> 00:39:57,699
Albin would be better in Ohio than

797
00:39:52,829 --> 00:40:02,860
seascape but I I wonder about the

798
00:39:57,699 --> 00:40:06,699
gapping so maybe an Eevee too would

799
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:08,769
probably be too soft way too soft so

800
00:40:06,699 --> 00:40:12,129
maybe try some Portola because it had

801
00:40:08,769 --> 00:40:13,690
great great quality the flavor wasn't

802
00:40:12,130 --> 00:40:17,530
good for us but the flavor could change

803
00:40:13,690 --> 00:40:27,579
with the region there's a story try and

804
00:40:17,530 --> 00:40:29,970
see are there any other questions it

805
00:40:27,579 --> 00:40:32,319
looks like there may be one or two more

806
00:40:29,969 --> 00:40:36,129
thank you all for participating today

807
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:37,660
really appreciate your patience we had a

808
00:40:36,130 --> 00:40:40,720
few issues with audio but for the most

809
00:40:37,659 --> 00:40:44,079
part I think it was summer temperatures

810
00:40:40,719 --> 00:40:47,129
in Ontario well in southern Ontario you

811
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:52,539
can get those in the low 30s and

812
00:40:47,130 --> 00:40:56,309
sometimes in August Nights in the low 25

813
00:40:52,539 --> 00:40:59,320
to 28 Celsius once you get further north

814
00:40:56,309 --> 00:41:02,440
then you can you can get a few days into

815
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:04,630
that into the 30s but by and large the

816
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:06,490
temperatures are much lower it just

817
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:11,230
depends where you are because Ontario's

818
00:41:06,489 --> 00:41:13,509
a big province how does Fabien yield in

819
00:41:11,230 --> 00:41:15,340
the second season well some clothes had

820
00:41:13,510 --> 00:41:18,460
very good yields with it look with it in

821
00:41:15,340 --> 00:41:24,850
on southern Ontario Canada pens where

822
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:28,119
you are less than seas napier every

823
00:41:24,849 --> 00:41:30,309
every year yes about 3035 percent less

824
00:41:28,119 --> 00:41:32,559
than seascape and then with the winner

825
00:41:30,309 --> 00:41:35,590
damage if you had winner damage which

826
00:41:32,559 --> 00:41:38,710
isn't as severe as we're waiting for the

827
00:41:35,590 --> 00:41:41,980
big winter to sort out these varieties

828
00:41:38,710 --> 00:41:43,960
they haven't had a good test but if yeah

829
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:46,809
if there was winter damage you may lose

830
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:49,690
a lot of that early yield on Albion like

831
00:41:46,809 --> 00:41:52,199
maybe 50% but I think it would catch

832
00:41:49,690 --> 00:41:52,200
back up

833
00:41:58,570 --> 00:42:03,830
yeah I always think I was wondering

834
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:05,659
about what Kevin's comment about is your

835
00:42:03,829 --> 00:42:10,369
reduction between varieties marketable

836
00:42:05,659 --> 00:42:12,969
yield I would say my gut feel is that a

837
00:42:10,369 --> 00:42:16,940
bein has more marketable yield than

838
00:42:12,969 --> 00:42:19,579
seascape and that you'd look you'd lose

839
00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:24,829
in skill scape you'd lose marketable

840
00:42:19,579 --> 00:42:27,590
yield to a marketable yield what

841
00:42:24,829 --> 00:42:30,769
spacings do we use we're going for rose

842
00:42:27,590 --> 00:42:32,390
on a diagonal pattern on a bed foot

843
00:42:30,769 --> 00:42:37,429
apart between the rows for the part

844
00:42:32,389 --> 00:42:39,799
between the plants the Charles in

845
00:42:37,429 --> 00:42:48,889
Woodstock were a two row bed but 12 by

846
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:50,990
12 inch lacing you don't need 8 inches

847
00:42:48,889 --> 00:42:56,960
is the absolute minimum you want to go

848
00:42:50,989 --> 00:43:00,439
with in the row anything and then that's

849
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:02,449
tight and you will increase your yields

850
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:05,389
but that will give you a lower yield per

851
00:43:02,449 --> 00:43:08,569
plant the tighter you get so it's a sort

852
00:43:05,389 --> 00:43:15,500
of balance between your player versus

853
00:43:08,570 --> 00:43:17,150
yield per plant alright then thank you

854
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:19,369
very much Pam and Adam thank you

855
00:43:17,150 --> 00:43:23,300
everyone for participating and we will

856
00:43:19,369 --> 00:43:28,329
be back with you again next week thanks

857
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:28,330
Kathy thank you bye bye now

858
00:43:35,099 --> 00:43:37,160
you

859
00:43:57,250 --> 00:43:59,309
you
