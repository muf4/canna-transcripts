1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,169
when you need your blade sharpened the

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:06,899
best thing to do is have a couple of

3
00:00:04,169 --> 00:00:08,969
blades on hand so that you can take one

4
00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:10,679
off and then put on the new blade and

5
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:13,440
while that way can be used for another

6
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:15,809
eight to ten to twelve hours of use then

7
00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:17,399
you take the blade you took off to the

8
00:00:15,808 --> 00:00:19,379
local hardware store and most of the

9
00:00:17,399 --> 00:00:20,788
local hardware store should be able to

10
00:00:19,379 --> 00:00:23,250
put a nice edge on you and it's

11
00:00:20,789 --> 00:00:25,710
important having a sharp blade not only

12
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:28,528
keeps the plants healthy but it costs

13
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:29,880
you less and fuel in the long run so the

14
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:32,850
first thing I like to do is grab a piece

15
00:00:29,879 --> 00:00:34,019
of cardboard is something lay down on no

16
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:35,250
matter how much you try to clean your

17
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:37,079
concrete pad it's always going to be

18
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:39,980
dirty and if that's a concern for you

19
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:42,359
this makes a nice surface to lay down on

20
00:00:39,979 --> 00:00:43,949
one thing i like to keep with me when

21
00:00:42,359 --> 00:00:47,070
i'm changing blades and what I'm taking

22
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:48,899
them off is a welding glove you can pick

23
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:51,659
these up at your local hardware store a

24
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:53,219
large rag works well I like a glove

25
00:00:51,659 --> 00:00:55,259
because I can actually hold on to the

26
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:58,198
blade there's no chance of its slipping

27
00:00:55,259 --> 00:01:00,808
out of my hand when you're taking a

28
00:00:58,198 --> 00:01:03,929
blade off if you're not holding on to it

29
00:01:00,808 --> 00:01:06,420
it's going to want to turn on you you

30
00:01:03,929 --> 00:01:08,159
never want to be use a socket to take a

31
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:10,290
blade off if you're not holding on to it

32
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:11,880
when you're laying on your back trying

33
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:14,189
to take a blade off sometimes

34
00:01:11,879 --> 00:01:16,709
counterclockwise and clockwise becomes

35
00:01:14,188 --> 00:01:18,618
confusing so what I do is before I use

36
00:01:16,709 --> 00:01:21,089
my tool I'll make sure that it's

37
00:01:18,618 --> 00:01:22,799
loosening up or tightening down

38
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:24,570
depending on what I'm doing and I'll set

39
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:26,430
it before hand so when I crawl

40
00:01:24,569 --> 00:01:35,169
underneath the machine I'm already set

41
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:37,159
up to do it okay

42
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:39,560
now when you take them out what I like

43
00:01:37,159 --> 00:01:41,570
to do is just mark it right top on it

44
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:48,228
whatever helps you put that blade back

45
00:01:41,569 --> 00:01:49,639
in the same way I like to use the center

46
00:01:48,228 --> 00:01:52,489
block is something to hold the top of

47
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:56,060
the lower down this way you can access

48
00:01:52,489 --> 00:01:57,649
the blade safely just remember with

49
00:01:56,060 --> 00:02:00,469
these small rotary mowers you don't want

50
00:01:57,649 --> 00:02:02,478
to leave them tip back for very long gas

51
00:02:00,469 --> 00:02:04,609
and oil can move on you and they'll

52
00:02:02,478 --> 00:02:09,469
start spilling out remove your blade

53
00:02:04,609 --> 00:02:12,259
move your tools to the side and lift up

54
00:02:09,469 --> 00:02:14,330
your cinder block and set the mower back

55
00:02:12,259 --> 00:02:16,899
down until you're ready to put your

56
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:16,900
blade back on
