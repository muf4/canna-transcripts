00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,819
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,218 --> 00:00:04,820
University

3
00:00:07,339 --> 00:00:13,349
okay hello everyone I mean today I'm

4
00:00:11,429 --> 00:00:15,899
going to talk to you about linear

5
00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:17,399
underlying soil measurement and I'm

6
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:19,710
going to look at it from two

7
00:00:17,399 --> 00:00:22,189
perspectives including being a vine

8
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:26,640
physiological perspective as well as

9
00:00:22,189 --> 00:00:28,018
vineyard soil microbial grade microbial

10
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:31,588
and wine fermentation microbial

11
00:00:28,018 --> 00:00:34,679
precession so if you look at a picture

12
00:00:31,588 --> 00:00:37,558
you will notice that fair cylinder vine

13
00:00:34,679 --> 00:00:41,359
for a closer picture so maintaining bare

14
00:00:37,558 --> 00:00:43,649
soil under mine is the most popular

15
00:00:41,359 --> 00:00:46,410
linear measurement practice in our

16
00:00:43,649 --> 00:00:48,960
region and the reason for that is we

17
00:00:46,409 --> 00:00:51,378
basically heritage this from the juice

18
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:56,009
grape industry where they needed a

19
00:00:51,378 --> 00:00:58,049
larger vine to support higher yield but

20
00:00:56,009 --> 00:01:00,320
for a wine grape industry this is a

21
00:00:58,049 --> 00:01:03,268
excessive vigor it's a problem

22
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:05,790
people are just sent in their crews to

23
00:01:03,268 --> 00:01:08,489
do hedging model things to do leapling

24
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:10,860
multiple times just to control the vine

25
00:01:08,489 --> 00:01:14,579
bigger so you know that this is not a

26
00:01:10,859 --> 00:01:17,989
very favourable kind of mentioned

27
00:01:14,579 --> 00:01:21,179
practice in our wine grape industry and

28
00:01:17,989 --> 00:01:24,719
plus there's a research done by our

29
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:30,150
group by mr. Adam Carroll who's not here

30
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:32,519
today who found that using glyphosate to

31
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:35,400
maintain bare soil and Irvine in

32
00:01:32,519 --> 00:01:38,280
vineyard for long turn you increase the

33
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:42,090
amount of a nutrient bleaching and also

34
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:45,120
the pesticide leaching and soil leachate

35
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:49,500
so overall speaking is this is not

36
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:51,780
really simple for a lot of the wine

37
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:56,040
grape vineyard and we are looking for a

38
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:59,790
good alternative so many people study

39
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:01,830
that using undermine cover crops as the

40
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:03,560
alternative and they found that under

41
00:02:01,829 --> 00:02:07,459
vine cover crop can reduce fine vigor

42
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:11,340
through water and nutrient competition

43
00:02:07,459 --> 00:02:11,640
but those studies were done in young Ben

44
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:14,759
Urich

45
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:17,589
so what happening in a mature vineyard

46
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:20,318
for with those vines with

47
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:24,780
um well it's a well-established fruit

48
00:02:20,318 --> 00:02:28,060
system so study done by our group again

49
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:29,830
um in a mature recently married we found

50
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:32,650
that under vine cover crops did not

51
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:35,530
impact on vine growth did not impact on

52
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:38,769
vine water nutrient status and do not

53
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:41,860
vary composition but what we found is

54
00:02:38,769 --> 00:02:45,939
that when sensory properties wasn't was

55
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:49,390
were impacted and that is the really

56
00:02:45,939 --> 00:02:51,459
make us think because if we don't get

57
00:02:49,389 --> 00:02:55,179
the effect from the physiological

58
00:02:51,459 --> 00:02:58,870
perspective what else can plain the

59
00:02:55,180 --> 00:03:01,360
treat there and so we start getting

60
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:03,069
curious about the microbes so maybe

61
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:06,700
microbes is playing the trick there so

62
00:03:03,068 --> 00:03:13,359
we want to study more to focus on the

63
00:03:06,699 --> 00:03:15,729
microbial perspective in a beard so

64
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,620
these are our objectives we want to

65
00:03:15,729 --> 00:03:19,768
evaluate how under vine cover crops

66
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:23,639
would affect on the vegetative growth

67
00:03:19,769 --> 00:03:27,579
yelled food composition of a mature

68
00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:29,530
Riesling vineyard aim finger lakes and

69
00:03:27,579 --> 00:03:31,120
we want to determine how so your health

70
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:33,909
will be impacted by adopting different

71
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:38,159
undefined flows from flora management

72
00:03:33,909 --> 00:03:42,189
practice so these are considered as the

73
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:44,199
physiological perspectives so we also

74
00:03:42,189 --> 00:03:46,479
want to know that microbial perspective

75
00:03:44,199 --> 00:03:49,500
so I want to see how formant flora

76
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:53,280
measurement practice would affect soil

77
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:57,699
great and also wine fermenting microbial

78
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:59,919
and finally we want to evaluate wine the

79
00:03:57,699 --> 00:04:02,078
sensory property of the wine to see if

80
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:06,810
the wine sensory property are being

81
00:04:02,079 --> 00:04:10,439
affected if so is this going through a

82
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:13,680
physiology a root or is going through

83
00:04:10,439 --> 00:04:13,680
microbial roots

84
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:21,639
so our experimenter was contacted and at

85
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:23,650
Abbott New York sitting on the Howard

86
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:26,168
gravely loan with long term average

87
00:04:23,649 --> 00:04:28,269
growth degree days around a thousand

88
00:04:26,168 --> 00:04:30,819
three hundred seventy six based on

89
00:04:28,269 --> 00:04:31,389
degree Celsius and the vineyard was

90
00:04:30,819 --> 00:04:34,839
coming

91
00:04:31,389 --> 00:04:37,509
we managed the vines armature vine so in

92
00:04:34,839 --> 00:04:40,029
2014 they're around 14 to 15 years old

93
00:04:37,509 --> 00:04:45,219
and the vines where Scott Henry changed

94
00:04:40,029 --> 00:04:48,549
to 16 bucks per meter and these are the

95
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:51,670
treatments we use so GL y means

96
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:54,400
glyphosate so we spray glyphosate one to

97
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:57,819
two times per season depending on the

98
00:04:54,399 --> 00:05:04,109
weed pressure and we also consider this

99
00:04:57,819 --> 00:05:07,269
as our control the NR 2 treatments are

100
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:10,810
native natural vegetation so we have

101
00:05:07,269 --> 00:05:13,750
previous MV which you basically just led

102
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:15,910
to we to grow under vine and we mow them

103
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:20,680
down whenever it's interfering the

104
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:24,160
fruiting zone and C ult which means soil

105
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:27,910
cultivation so we did it by using roto

106
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:30,880
tiller and cultivation for the hoe

107
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:34,000
experimental setup we adopt randomized

108
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:36,670
complete block design with each of the

109
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,470
treatment replicate for four times for

110
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:41,319
each of our experimental unit it

111
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:43,480
contains nine panels in three rows as

112
00:05:41,319 --> 00:05:46,149
you can see here for each of the panel

113
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:50,560
contains three binds so there's nine

114
00:05:46,149 --> 00:05:53,849
panels we only collect our sample from

115
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:56,439
the middle panel which is our data panel

116
00:05:53,850 --> 00:06:00,820
because we're doing microbial work here

117
00:05:56,439 --> 00:06:04,170
so we really want to have that that

118
00:06:00,819 --> 00:06:07,389
physical and spatial barrier to prevent

119
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:11,020
the interfere that intervene coming from

120
00:06:07,389 --> 00:06:13,659
outside of our experimental unit so

121
00:06:11,019 --> 00:06:17,289
that's why we set up like this and this

122
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:23,350
so to be big enough do you have those

123
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:28,390
buffer so then let's look at the results

124
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:31,900
for first the physiological results so

125
00:06:28,389 --> 00:06:33,819
vegetative growth we measured primary

126
00:06:31,899 --> 00:06:35,529
shoot growth and lateral shoot growth

127
00:06:33,819 --> 00:06:38,889
throughout the growing season for each

128
00:06:35,529 --> 00:06:41,229
of the year for 2015-16 just remind you

129
00:06:38,889 --> 00:06:43,779
that the experiment was set up in 2014

130
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:44,980
but when we collect the yelled and grave

131
00:06:43,779 --> 00:06:48,459
data until

132
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:50,560
14 and it growth like Pacific growth we

133
00:06:48,459 --> 00:06:54,839
only collect the data until than 15,000

134
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:58,180
16 so it was assessed in this two years

135
00:06:54,839 --> 00:06:59,739
so the vegetative growth we use primary

136
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:03,519
and lateral shoot growth as an indicator

137
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:05,590
and as you can see here for a lateral

138
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:08,139
shoot growth we measure two went and

139
00:07:05,589 --> 00:07:12,399
also the proportion of shoot that has

140
00:07:08,139 --> 00:07:14,439
that had the lateral shoot and basically

141
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:17,169
we did not see any difference amount of

142
00:07:14,439 --> 00:07:19,600
treatments just to remind you that at

143
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:21,610
our site our vine sorry there the vines

144
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:23,560
are huge and they're mature so they had

145
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:25,750
that really extensive really

146
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:28,120
well-established brew system so they

147
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:31,660
have it get assessed to those really

148
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:33,610
deep soil water and nutrients so it is

149
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:35,920
very reasonable to not seeing any

150
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:41,020
difference amount of treatment here it

151
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:43,600
turns out the vegetative growth and we

152
00:07:41,019 --> 00:07:49,629
use midday stand water potential as an

153
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:53,530
indicator for the vine water status so

154
00:07:49,629 --> 00:07:55,709
as measured as farce and we did not see

155
00:07:53,529 --> 00:08:00,969
any difference amount of treatment in

156
00:07:55,709 --> 00:08:04,180
2016 but in the late season 2015 I found

157
00:08:00,970 --> 00:08:07,600
that natural vegetation and cultivation

158
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:10,990
basically divining those two treatments

159
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:14,350
had a more had higher stem water

160
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:18,100
potential compared to that of glyphosate

161
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:21,760
so the the the theory behind that is for

162
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:26,890
those two treatments they basically has

163
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:29,949
a soil surface protection so and in

164
00:08:26,889 --> 00:08:32,080
native vegetation in 2015

165
00:08:29,949 --> 00:08:34,330
around August we had very low rainfall

166
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:36,910
and then a lot of the weeds or stunt

167
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:39,090
growth so there is just hang out there

168
00:08:36,909 --> 00:08:42,899
but they're not doing like a very

169
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:47,350
aggressive growing and for cultivation

170
00:08:42,899 --> 00:08:50,470
after we do the cultivation the plant

171
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:53,740
procedures are just left on top of the

172
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:56,379
soil so those stuff just serve as a

173
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:57,639
surface cover like a mulch and they

174
00:08:56,379 --> 00:09:00,189
protect

175
00:08:57,639 --> 00:09:02,620
the surface soil water to evaporate it

176
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:06,010
evaporates so that means for those

177
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:14,259
things that got more of the surface soil

178
00:09:06,009 --> 00:09:17,559
of water for a vine nutrient status we

179
00:09:14,259 --> 00:09:20,019
took leaf petioles at Verizon for each

180
00:09:17,559 --> 00:09:22,239
of the year we did not see any

181
00:09:20,019 --> 00:09:26,470
difference among treatment in 2016 but

182
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:30,639
in 2015 we found that natural vegetation

183
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:35,220
basically increase amount of the alumni

184
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:39,669
and the petioles compared to glyphosate

185
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:41,560
so I think my theory behind this is for

186
00:09:39,669 --> 00:09:43,479
those if you input all of your organic

187
00:09:41,559 --> 00:09:46,689
matters and if there's a rescrew

188
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:49,870
actively growing in your soil that means

189
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:52,540
in a very small scale localized soil

190
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:55,750
there'd be soil acidification and that

191
00:09:52,539 --> 00:09:58,629
freed up a lot of the free aluminum to

192
00:09:55,750 --> 00:10:02,159
the plant so that's why we see this and

193
00:09:58,629 --> 00:10:05,708
that's the theory back that I formed and

194
00:10:02,159 --> 00:10:09,578
for natural vegetation that also reduce

195
00:10:05,708 --> 00:10:12,549
the amount of magnums in the vine by 28

196
00:10:09,578 --> 00:10:14,679
percent compared to the cultivation and

197
00:10:12,549 --> 00:10:21,099
this can just purely due to the

198
00:10:14,679 --> 00:10:23,919
competition and we also collect the

199
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:28,120
think yield and pruning weight so right

200
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:31,469
note it's very simple it's just how much

201
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:34,448
of the fruits for each fine we got so we

202
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:38,620
measured the amount of fruits for each

203
00:10:34,448 --> 00:10:42,099
vine and we weigh it that's how we

204
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:45,339
measured the reproductive growth for the

205
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:49,870
vine and pruning weights so I'm going to

206
00:10:45,339 --> 00:10:51,820
explain your pruning weight so and each

207
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:56,679
of the growing season after we harvest

208
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:59,019
and after the leaf all will prove we

209
00:10:56,679 --> 00:11:01,599
prune the vine into the same shape with

210
00:10:59,019 --> 00:11:04,060
same numbers of shoots and same number

211
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:07,329
of buds so just maintaining into the

212
00:11:04,059 --> 00:11:11,469
same shape and those shoes got pruned

213
00:11:07,328 --> 00:11:14,409
off we consider us as the fish

214
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:17,819
of the confirmed beard growth so we

215
00:11:14,409 --> 00:11:20,230
weighed those shoots as our cream weight

216
00:11:17,818 --> 00:11:22,750
so as you can see here those are the

217
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:25,899
shoe step Kuna and this guy's having

218
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:29,019
that backpack a weighing scale and we

219
00:11:25,899 --> 00:11:31,720
just weigh the amount of shoes we prune

220
00:11:29,019 --> 00:11:34,149
from the vine so that is the indicator

221
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:37,449
for the vegetative growth for each of

222
00:11:34,149 --> 00:11:39,309
the vine so now we've got the gel from

223
00:11:37,448 --> 00:11:42,159
the vine we've got a vegetative growth

224
00:11:39,309 --> 00:11:44,198
of the vine we know we get an idea of

225
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:49,480
the balance between those reproductive

226
00:11:44,198 --> 00:11:52,049
growth and vegetative growth however in

227
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:57,009
our study we found no difference amount

228
00:11:52,049 --> 00:12:00,059
the yellow pruning weight and also the

229
00:11:57,009 --> 00:12:03,430
ratio between them so there's no

230
00:12:00,059 --> 00:12:05,258
difference so again because our vines

231
00:12:03,429 --> 00:12:08,188
are huge and they have very deep roots

232
00:12:05,259 --> 00:12:11,289
and so they got they have those

233
00:12:08,188 --> 00:12:14,230
resources coming really deep down from

234
00:12:11,289 --> 00:12:17,139
the soil so it is it is reasonable to

235
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:20,560
not see those differences in the mature

236
00:12:17,139 --> 00:12:27,220
beam yure any basic conference are a

237
00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:32,379
previous study so we also measure the

238
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:35,699
great basic composition parameters such

239
00:12:32,379 --> 00:12:38,759
as bricks pH and total acidity a

240
00:12:35,698 --> 00:12:41,198
previous TA here

241
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:44,289
so in general we don't see any

242
00:12:41,198 --> 00:12:46,088
difference but in 2015 the cultivation

243
00:12:44,289 --> 00:12:50,289
the great friend cultivation treatments

244
00:12:46,089 --> 00:12:53,170
had a lower acidity if you look more

245
00:12:50,289 --> 00:12:55,599
closely into the bricks for a 2015

246
00:12:53,169 --> 00:13:00,068
cultivation here you will find that a

247
00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:03,909
number it's really weird because when

248
00:13:00,068 --> 00:13:07,179
the in a normal mature ation process

249
00:13:03,909 --> 00:13:12,730
usually the brick the bricks the sugar

250
00:13:07,179 --> 00:13:15,578
content is coupled with the lower amount

251
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:20,139
of acidity so when you get hired sugar

252
00:13:15,578 --> 00:13:24,008
you get lower acidity but in this

253
00:13:20,139 --> 00:13:25,289
treatment we found that the cultivation

254
00:13:24,009 --> 00:13:28,529
the grapes from the cultivate

255
00:13:25,289 --> 00:13:32,459
fifteen actually had a lower sugar and

256
00:13:28,529 --> 00:13:34,679
also Loris it is very weird so what we

257
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:36,240
found is thank you on 15 we had a lot we

258
00:13:34,679 --> 00:13:39,679
had some binding that treatment

259
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:43,230
specifically had little virus infection

260
00:13:39,679 --> 00:13:47,069
so that's why that the couple of sugar

261
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:49,610
and acids happen and into on sixteen a

262
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:53,129
lot of those fines were naturally bad or

263
00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:54,750
those fines that show the really severe

264
00:13:53,129 --> 00:13:57,539
symptoms we see excluded for our

265
00:13:54,750 --> 00:14:01,379
experience so in 2016 we see that a

266
00:13:57,539 --> 00:14:03,269
number come back to normal but basically

267
00:14:01,379 --> 00:14:09,200
we do not see any difference among the

268
00:14:03,269 --> 00:14:13,649
treatments for those parameters and also

269
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:15,090
we assess sensory properties I know a

270
00:14:13,649 --> 00:14:18,299
lot of you are very excited about this

271
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:21,980
data because a lot of you had contribute

272
00:14:18,299 --> 00:14:26,729
to this and got the money out of it it's

273
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:29,519
so I the most important thing is you

274
00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:32,009
will no longer you know do you remember

275
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:35,490
those days when you open your email

276
00:14:32,009 --> 00:14:38,519
inbox and see 10 emails from me asking

277
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:40,500
you to do my sensory study and do you

278
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:42,539
remember that time when you see me in

279
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:44,669
the hallway like just sweaty and grumpy

280
00:14:42,539 --> 00:14:47,009
trying to get people stuff in the room

281
00:14:44,669 --> 00:14:48,959
to smell my stinky why I knew that you

282
00:14:47,009 --> 00:14:53,309
get your freaked out because I look like

283
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:55,139
like but I going to use not going to

284
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:57,989
happen again because we've got all the

285
00:14:55,139 --> 00:15:01,799
data here but unfortunately any is going

286
00:14:57,990 --> 00:15:04,799
to do that in the near future so that's

287
00:15:01,799 --> 00:15:08,009
a look at data I'm going to explain to

288
00:15:04,799 --> 00:15:11,549
you how we did this for those few didn't

289
00:15:08,009 --> 00:15:12,799
come to my sensory study thank you by

290
00:15:11,549 --> 00:15:18,269
the way

291
00:15:12,799 --> 00:15:20,939
so we basically a soda family peles to

292
00:15:18,269 --> 00:15:23,610
smell through all the wines and then

293
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:27,330
sort the wine into groups based on their

294
00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:29,550
aroma similarity so the wine says smells

295
00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:32,550
the same to the panelists they just put

296
00:15:29,549 --> 00:15:37,620
it into the sink ooh and then we assign

297
00:15:32,549 --> 00:15:38,879
the score based on the grouping and then

298
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:40,379
we do we

299
00:15:38,879 --> 00:15:45,179
collect all the data and then we

300
00:15:40,379 --> 00:15:48,720
calculate the distance between or among

301
00:15:45,179 --> 00:15:51,209
the samples and then we visualize the

302
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:55,290
soap we visualize it based on the

303
00:15:51,210 --> 00:15:56,879
distant matrix so I know it's very it

304
00:15:55,289 --> 00:15:58,889
sounds very confusing and it sounds very

305
00:15:56,879 --> 00:16:00,809
complicated but what do you need to know

306
00:15:58,889 --> 00:16:03,000
is that if the samples are closer

307
00:16:00,809 --> 00:16:05,909
together that means they're a real mass

308
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,470
similarity or higher if the sample is a

309
00:16:05,909 --> 00:16:11,250
further apart that means there are

310
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:15,120
almost a molarity or a lower so as you

311
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:17,279
can see into 114 glyphosate samples

312
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:20,730
close together so then they means they

313
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:24,629
stay there there's maybe a treatment

314
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:27,170
effect but let's look at 2015/16 so in

315
00:16:24,629 --> 00:16:31,679
215 now we see the costing of

316
00:16:27,169 --> 00:16:35,849
cultivation but not glyphosate in 2016

317
00:16:31,679 --> 00:16:39,929
we don't see any clustering or pattern

318
00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:42,600
at all so which means we don't like

319
00:16:39,929 --> 00:16:46,229
overall speaking we don't see the

320
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:54,300
treatment effects in each of each year

321
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:56,610
of wine sensory properties so also

322
00:16:54,299 --> 00:16:59,490
measure the soil health parameters

323
00:16:56,610 --> 00:17:02,340
including aggregate stability organic

324
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:07,459
matter accountant microbial respiration

325
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:11,009
rate and carbon minimize ability so here

326
00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:14,779
in the third year of study in 2016 we

327
00:17:11,009 --> 00:17:17,430
basically see that in the increase of

328
00:17:14,779 --> 00:17:21,539
aggregate stability and organic matter

329
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:24,269
for the natural vegetation treatment and

330
00:17:21,539 --> 00:17:27,539
it is very easy to understand because if

331
00:17:24,269 --> 00:17:29,519
you just let a way to grow that's the

332
00:17:27,539 --> 00:17:31,589
organic manner that's organic matter and

333
00:17:29,519 --> 00:17:33,629
during the winter they got killed and

334
00:17:31,589 --> 00:17:36,539
it's just a natural improve of or

335
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:38,550
getting metairie to the soil so if you

336
00:17:36,539 --> 00:17:42,500
have a higher organic matter accountant

337
00:17:38,549 --> 00:17:45,049
then you were expecting a better

338
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:47,940
microbial activity and also a better

339
00:17:45,049 --> 00:17:52,289
aggregate stability so it's easy to

340
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:54,930
understand here so in 2000 in :

341
00:17:52,289 --> 00:17:56,819
team also see an increase the microbial

342
00:17:54,930 --> 00:18:00,630
respiration rate in the natural

343
00:17:56,819 --> 00:18:03,509
vegetation and also 2016 compared to the

344
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:05,900
rest of the treatments and so microbial

345
00:18:03,509 --> 00:18:10,230
respiration is indicator for the

346
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:12,150
microbial activity in soil so and it is

347
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:14,670
important because you know you have a

348
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:18,000
higher microbial activity that means you

349
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:21,779
will have a higher nutrient immuno as a

350
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:25,200
minimized mineralization and in your

351
00:18:21,779 --> 00:18:29,639
soil and your it's it's beneficial to

352
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:32,569
both your plants and the soil so we see

353
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:35,310
that natural vegetation increased

354
00:18:32,569 --> 00:18:39,559
microbial activity there in both year

355
00:18:35,309 --> 00:18:43,109
and for the carbon memorize ability is

356
00:18:39,559 --> 00:18:45,269
indicator for the nutrient

357
00:18:43,109 --> 00:18:48,269
mineralization the soil and we found

358
00:18:45,269 --> 00:18:50,339
that natural vegetation increased

359
00:18:48,269 --> 00:18:54,509
immunizes ability cover meal as it might

360
00:18:50,339 --> 00:19:00,589
mean arise ability in 2015 so overall

361
00:18:54,509 --> 00:19:06,029
speaking our soil health was improved

362
00:19:00,589 --> 00:19:09,119
throughout the years so to summarize the

363
00:19:06,029 --> 00:19:11,629
physiological perspective that line

364
00:19:09,119 --> 00:19:14,339
vegetative growth fruit composition

365
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:16,380
basic food composition parameters and

366
00:19:14,339 --> 00:19:18,990
wine sensory properties were not

367
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:22,430
impacted there's no difference among the

368
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:27,029
treatments however natural vegetation

369
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:32,279
treatments basically prove the soil

370
00:19:27,029 --> 00:19:38,730
health so let's look at best look at the

371
00:19:32,279 --> 00:19:41,819
the results from our microbial sunny so

372
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:45,180
we simple the SONA grapes in the

373
00:19:41,819 --> 00:19:48,509
vineyard we grid simple six soil cores

374
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:50,460
and ten clusters from each of the

375
00:19:48,509 --> 00:19:53,250
experimental units and then we combine

376
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:55,950
all the sub simples for each of the

377
00:19:53,250 --> 00:20:00,200
experiment and then we extract the DNA

378
00:19:55,950 --> 00:20:04,250
out of it using those in isolation kids

379
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:11,659
and we are also interested to see

380
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:12,980
the wine fermentation microbiome so so

381
00:20:11,659 --> 00:20:16,730
here I want to explain you're very clear

382
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:19,970
that we only want to capture the effect

383
00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:22,788
of the microbes so we want to get rid of

384
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:26,329
those great composition variation from

385
00:20:22,788 --> 00:20:29,839
different treatments so what we did was

386
00:20:26,329 --> 00:20:32,359
we obtained a corneal juice from Lansing

387
00:20:29,839 --> 00:20:34,879
that's a Riesling juice and then we

388
00:20:32,359 --> 00:20:36,889
pasteurize it so that's not coming from

389
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:38,929
our experiment site but it's just a base

390
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:41,350
juice that we use and we pasteurize it

391
00:20:38,929 --> 00:20:46,009
would kill all the microbes in there and

392
00:20:41,349 --> 00:20:48,558
we use that the base used to arrange 24

393
00:20:46,009 --> 00:20:52,849
cluster is from each of the treatment at

394
00:20:48,558 --> 00:20:57,288
our experimental site so that means we

395
00:20:52,849 --> 00:20:59,178
use so that means we dislodge those

396
00:20:57,288 --> 00:21:02,150
microbes on the surface of the quays

397
00:20:59,179 --> 00:21:05,330
from each of the treatment and then we

398
00:21:02,150 --> 00:21:09,288
use that to do a fermentation to

399
00:21:05,329 --> 00:21:11,480
inoculate the base juice so finally you

400
00:21:09,288 --> 00:21:13,640
know our doing our fermentation the only

401
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:17,569
difference amount the different batch of

402
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:20,000
the wine the only difference there is

403
00:21:17,569 --> 00:21:22,269
the microbiome difference and the

404
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:27,548
difference is coming from the treatment

405
00:21:22,269 --> 00:21:31,308
so we only we we really exclude that

406
00:21:27,548 --> 00:21:32,900
confounding factors of the very

407
00:21:31,308 --> 00:21:37,548
composition difference among the

408
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:40,250
treatments and then we took samples

409
00:21:37,548 --> 00:21:44,599
throughout the fermentation and the

410
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:49,159
simple DNA's then sequence used aluminum

411
00:21:44,599 --> 00:21:55,269
I seek and for bacterias we target 16s

412
00:21:49,159 --> 00:21:55,270
region for fungi we target IPS regions

413
00:21:55,329 --> 00:21:59,658
so this is the results before I getting

414
00:21:57,798 --> 00:22:02,179
a result I want to talk to you about the

415
00:21:59,659 --> 00:22:05,799
method we use as you can see here it

416
00:22:02,179 --> 00:22:09,919
says Pico a on axis which represents

417
00:22:05,798 --> 00:22:13,849
principal coordinates analysis so what

418
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:16,000
we did is we distract a metrics number

419
00:22:13,849 --> 00:22:17,868
in front each of the sample and that

420
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:21,148
takes

421
00:22:17,868 --> 00:22:23,999
organism relative abundance diversity

422
00:22:21,148 --> 00:22:28,138
and the presents and absence of those

423
00:22:23,999 --> 00:22:31,679
organisms for each you account for each

424
00:22:28,138 --> 00:22:36,019
of the sample and then among all those

425
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:39,749
samples there's a huge variation so we

426
00:22:36,019 --> 00:22:41,700
extract two dimension that explain the

427
00:22:39,749 --> 00:22:44,999
most variance among the sample and we

428
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:48,179
use those as our two x's and then we

429
00:22:44,999 --> 00:22:52,139
plot the samples according to those two

430
00:22:48,179 --> 00:22:54,720
x's again this is very company I know a

431
00:22:52,138 --> 00:22:59,038
lot of a lot of you are falling asleep

432
00:22:54,720 --> 00:23:01,229
but just keep in mind that if you see

433
00:22:59,038 --> 00:23:04,378
the samples are further apart that means

434
00:23:01,229 --> 00:23:07,739
their microbial community structure are

435
00:23:04,378 --> 00:23:10,709
less similarity if they're close

436
00:23:07,739 --> 00:23:14,729
together that means they're more similar

437
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:17,249
to each other so this is the soil

438
00:23:14,729 --> 00:23:21,389
bacterial community structured data for

439
00:23:17,249 --> 00:23:24,269
2014 basically we can see a pattern here

440
00:23:21,388 --> 00:23:29,269
that green dots which is the natural

441
00:23:24,269 --> 00:23:31,979
vegetation on top of here and then

442
00:23:29,269 --> 00:23:38,308
cultivation samples are here they

443
00:23:31,979 --> 00:23:40,499
separate according to the y-axis in 2014

444
00:23:38,308 --> 00:23:45,058
there's they just ran in this together

445
00:23:40,499 --> 00:23:48,419
it's hard to find a pattern here but

446
00:23:45,058 --> 00:23:51,178
until I'm 16 we basically see that the

447
00:23:48,419 --> 00:23:55,739
the blue dots the blue samples and the

448
00:23:51,179 --> 00:23:58,950
green samples they separated and this

449
00:23:55,739 --> 00:24:02,879
these are visual like a visual result

450
00:23:58,950 --> 00:24:05,580
but the visual result were validated

451
00:24:02,878 --> 00:24:07,248
with a paired criminal analysis so

452
00:24:05,579 --> 00:24:12,388
there's a number to actually show that

453
00:24:07,249 --> 00:24:15,149
your visual conception is true so let's

454
00:24:12,388 --> 00:24:17,428
look at 2014 you see that natural

455
00:24:15,148 --> 00:24:20,118
vegetation treatments the soil

456
00:24:17,429 --> 00:24:22,979
composition was very different from

457
00:24:20,118 --> 00:24:26,579
cultivation in quite the state so here

458
00:24:22,979 --> 00:24:29,340
in 2015 there's no pattern as you

459
00:24:26,579 --> 00:24:31,529
remember in the picoway analysis and

460
00:24:29,339 --> 00:24:34,859
yeah it is true there's

461
00:24:31,529 --> 00:24:37,829
different samanda treatment and in 2016

462
00:24:34,859 --> 00:24:40,740
that natural vegetation the green dots

463
00:24:37,829 --> 00:24:45,210
is very different from the glyphosate

464
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:47,309
which is the blue dot so the overall

465
00:24:45,210 --> 00:24:51,660
male analysis also showed that natural

466
00:24:47,309 --> 00:24:53,549
vegetation really make the bacterial

467
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:57,620
community structure very different from

468
00:24:53,549 --> 00:25:00,690
that of glyphosate and our cultivation

469
00:24:57,619 --> 00:25:03,629
and soil fungal community you also

470
00:25:00,690 --> 00:25:06,470
analyze that so there are two patterns

471
00:25:03,630 --> 00:25:11,100
you can visual you can find in the

472
00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:14,690
visual results here so first of all the

473
00:25:11,099 --> 00:25:18,389
round stop those round dots are here and

474
00:25:14,690 --> 00:25:20,610
out the square ducts are here and all

475
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:24,240
the diamond does are in the middle of

476
00:25:20,609 --> 00:25:28,919
the graph so they basically cluster it

477
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:31,980
based on our x-axis and the shape we

478
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:34,500
present here so basically our simples

479
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:37,349
cluster based on year year to year

480
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:41,279
difference is important here and also

481
00:25:37,349 --> 00:25:42,990
you see there's a colored clustering as

482
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:45,319
well because all the green paths no

483
00:25:42,990 --> 00:25:49,309
matter it's dark green or light green

484
00:25:45,319 --> 00:25:52,519
they basically separated so you see that

485
00:25:49,309 --> 00:25:55,049
natural vegetation had a huge impact on

486
00:25:52,519 --> 00:25:57,720
the microbial community on the fungal

487
00:25:55,049 --> 00:26:00,359
community structure here and also this

488
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:05,309
is validated by our appeared from ANOVA

489
00:26:00,359 --> 00:26:07,819
analysis as you can see in 2015-2016

490
00:26:05,309 --> 00:26:12,359
and the overall analysis showed that

491
00:26:07,819 --> 00:26:15,480
each Ana soil fungal community structure

492
00:26:12,359 --> 00:26:18,439
of each of the treatment being

493
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:18,440
distinctive

494
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:27,370
so I want to remind you why I wanted to

495
00:26:22,930 --> 00:26:29,320
do this analysis and also we look into

496
00:26:27,369 --> 00:26:32,259
the soil and then we look into the

497
00:26:29,319 --> 00:26:36,069
grapes and wine because many of you have

498
00:26:32,259 --> 00:26:37,750
may have noticed that microbiome in a

499
00:26:36,069 --> 00:26:40,179
wine world as being a really hot topic

500
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:44,890
there's a lot of good papers coming out

501
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:48,279
and they all focus on one issue that is

502
00:26:44,890 --> 00:26:51,340
micro biota Gua micro biota was a very

503
00:26:48,279 --> 00:26:53,349
vague term but basically they they

504
00:26:51,339 --> 00:26:55,869
claimed that microbes in the being

505
00:26:53,349 --> 00:27:01,179
marriage or microbes in the wine they

506
00:26:55,869 --> 00:27:04,269
give the wine a sense of location so

507
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:07,810
what do we want to really look into that

508
00:27:04,269 --> 00:27:09,849
and there are two leaders in United

509
00:27:07,809 --> 00:27:12,879
States they did a lot of the GU research

510
00:27:09,849 --> 00:27:14,799
on this topic including Jack Gilbert's

511
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:17,520
who came last year she gave a talk

512
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:21,190
Jackie opers Jackie O Berg's from

513
00:27:17,519 --> 00:27:27,369
University of Chicago and Dave Mills

514
00:27:21,190 --> 00:27:32,049
from UC Davis so for a um Gilbert's

515
00:27:27,369 --> 00:27:35,079
group they found that for vine aerial

516
00:27:32,049 --> 00:27:38,680
Oregon associate microbes there actually

517
00:27:35,079 --> 00:27:40,750
originates originated from the vineyard

518
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:43,210
soil so what's on the aerial parts

519
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:45,789
including grapes its originated friend

520
00:27:43,210 --> 00:27:49,180
of soil in abeyance oil but they only

521
00:27:45,789 --> 00:27:51,700
did a bacterial community study so we

522
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:53,410
want to look into the fungi to see if

523
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:56,440
that's true for fungi because you know

524
00:27:53,410 --> 00:27:59,100
that it's very different for uh for

525
00:27:56,440 --> 00:28:02,769
fungi and bacteria and thus for size and

526
00:27:59,099 --> 00:28:04,449
the mobility is very different so I want

527
00:28:02,769 --> 00:28:07,480
to see if that's true for fungal

528
00:28:04,450 --> 00:28:10,330
community as well and for that meal

529
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:16,210
scoop they found a strong association

530
00:28:10,329 --> 00:28:19,599
and mount vineyard site climate and also

531
00:28:16,210 --> 00:28:21,850
the wine fermenting microbiome so want

532
00:28:19,599 --> 00:28:23,589
to study that as well so and so later I

533
00:28:21,849 --> 00:28:27,579
will show you our wine data so that's

534
00:28:23,589 --> 00:28:30,189
why we we sent both from soil grapes to

535
00:28:27,579 --> 00:28:33,048
the Y fermentation so that's looking to

536
00:28:30,190 --> 00:28:35,379
let's look at the grid data we

537
00:28:33,048 --> 00:28:39,259
that is a very clear pattern they

538
00:28:35,378 --> 00:28:41,748
cluster based on shape but if you look

539
00:28:39,259 --> 00:28:46,460
at look into each of the cluster there's

540
00:28:41,749 --> 00:28:49,278
no separation based on the color so they

541
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:52,220
cluster based on year so years important

542
00:28:49,278 --> 00:28:54,048
vector here but not color treatment so

543
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:57,019
treatment it's not an important factor

544
00:28:54,048 --> 00:28:59,989
here so the thousand trick triggered the

545
00:28:57,019 --> 00:29:04,009
separation again this data other visual

546
00:28:59,989 --> 00:29:07,819
data is being supported by paired from a

547
00:29:04,009 --> 00:29:10,878
criminal analysis as you can see that

548
00:29:07,819 --> 00:29:14,509
there's no significance among the

549
00:29:10,878 --> 00:29:16,339
treatments for all three years so which

550
00:29:14,509 --> 00:29:18,440
means yes

551
00:29:16,339 --> 00:29:21,048
adopting different underlying soil

552
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:24,499
management practice really had a great

553
00:29:21,048 --> 00:29:28,489
impact on the soil microbial community

554
00:29:24,499 --> 00:29:30,489
but this does not reflect on what's on

555
00:29:28,489 --> 00:29:38,749
the grapes this is very different from

556
00:29:30,489 --> 00:29:41,389
the previous studies so um we take

557
00:29:38,749 --> 00:29:44,720
samples through all the wine

558
00:29:41,388 --> 00:29:48,638
fermentation so these in 2014 and this

559
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:51,618
is where we took the sample so day 7 and

560
00:29:48,638 --> 00:29:54,709
day night so Dana is the very beginning

561
00:29:51,618 --> 00:29:58,038
of the presentation as you can see it's

562
00:29:54,710 --> 00:30:00,470
when the sugars start dropping and day

563
00:29:58,038 --> 00:30:04,190
13 which is the back slope is that the

564
00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:07,700
peak of fermentation day 21 as a lay

565
00:30:04,190 --> 00:30:10,700
stage and day 48 that is at the end of

566
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:13,100
fermentation we so we took the same pose

567
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:16,028
throughout the fermentation process and

568
00:30:13,099 --> 00:30:21,378
we want to compare the treatments here

569
00:30:16,028 --> 00:30:23,989
so ni notte inoculated means it's just a

570
00:30:21,378 --> 00:30:27,230
fermentation control to see if the

571
00:30:23,989 --> 00:30:29,329
fermentation went wrong or not so we

572
00:30:27,230 --> 00:30:34,808
actually want what we want to compare is

573
00:30:29,329 --> 00:30:36,769
and these treatments here so this is

574
00:30:34,808 --> 00:30:38,928
non-metric and what i damage on sorting

575
00:30:36,769 --> 00:30:42,288
is a very is a different method than the

576
00:30:38,929 --> 00:30:44,840
pee kool-aid but the way to interpret

577
00:30:42,288 --> 00:30:46,730
the data is the same so if you see the

578
00:30:44,839 --> 00:30:50,859
points are close then

579
00:30:46,730 --> 00:30:54,559
microbial community are more similar and

580
00:30:50,859 --> 00:30:58,819
vice-versa so if you see here it's a

581
00:30:54,559 --> 00:31:02,480
very very clear closing pattern that the

582
00:30:58,819 --> 00:31:04,759
simple cluster based on they stay a

583
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:12,349
fermentation or a station fermentation

584
00:31:04,759 --> 00:31:14,509
but not by treatment here so what we see

585
00:31:12,349 --> 00:31:17,240
here is that the soil microbial

586
00:31:14,509 --> 00:31:19,460
community was heavily impacted by using

587
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:22,299
different soil management patches and

588
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:25,970
then this does not reflect on the grapes

589
00:31:22,299 --> 00:31:31,669
so nothing for springing over into the

590
00:31:25,970 --> 00:31:37,519
wine fermentation another interesting

591
00:31:31,670 --> 00:31:40,130
thing that we found is as this so sacrum

592
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:43,000
I see is always being considered as the

593
00:31:40,130 --> 00:31:45,920
major player during a wine fermentation

594
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:48,079
what is main is during a wine

595
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:50,600
fermentation or at least at the peak of

596
00:31:48,079 --> 00:31:52,369
the fermentation the second we see would

597
00:31:50,599 --> 00:31:54,559
present the most in the relative

598
00:31:52,369 --> 00:31:57,109
abundance because as a major player is

599
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:59,929
doing the workers its equity growing so

600
00:31:57,109 --> 00:32:02,589
the numbers of the sacrum Isis means

601
00:31:59,930 --> 00:32:05,990
that the largest during the fermentation

602
00:32:02,589 --> 00:32:09,289
however in our fermentation what we

603
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:13,099
found is that hence any Apsara presented

604
00:32:09,289 --> 00:32:15,799
most in relative abundance Theory all

605
00:32:13,099 --> 00:32:17,179
the fermentation and even at the peak of

606
00:32:15,799 --> 00:32:20,210
the fermentation so if you look at the

607
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:23,480
peak of impatient which is stage 13 it's

608
00:32:20,210 --> 00:32:27,650
around 60% relative abundance whereas

609
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:32,079
the sacrum is only 15% of 303 of

610
00:32:27,650 --> 00:32:32,080
abundance this is a huge difference and

611
00:32:32,769 --> 00:32:38,809
so that's very different from what we

612
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:41,779
normally think and from most of the

613
00:32:38,809 --> 00:32:47,210
previous study however we don't know

614
00:32:41,779 --> 00:32:50,389
what the actual function for the $0.10

615
00:32:47,210 --> 00:32:53,269
for us there in the wine fermentation so

616
00:32:50,390 --> 00:32:59,480
just you know just show you this very

617
00:32:53,269 --> 00:33:02,839
interesting results okay so finally the

618
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:08,240
wine sensory studied for us simulated

619
00:33:02,839 --> 00:33:12,549
spontaneous fermentation so this is the

620
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:15,049
results so it's very very Rendon

621
00:33:12,549 --> 00:33:18,769
scattered of the samples on the

622
00:33:15,049 --> 00:33:22,819
two-dimensional plot so basically we we

623
00:33:18,769 --> 00:33:24,769
did not see any patterns here so it is a

624
00:33:22,819 --> 00:33:27,529
very reason because we see no difference

625
00:33:24,769 --> 00:33:29,960
of microbial communities and mounded

626
00:33:27,529 --> 00:33:32,779
grapes on the grapes and on the

627
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:34,779
treatments and also there's no

628
00:33:32,779 --> 00:33:38,329
difference among treatments in the wine

629
00:33:34,779 --> 00:33:46,509
so that the sensory properties were not

630
00:33:38,329 --> 00:33:50,599
impacted is very reasonable and so yeah

631
00:33:46,509 --> 00:33:54,200
that's basically our microbial study

632
00:33:50,599 --> 00:33:57,589
so to summarize it we found that vintage

633
00:33:54,200 --> 00:34:00,170
being them the the may play the major

634
00:33:57,589 --> 00:34:03,199
role there in terms of the microbial

635
00:34:00,170 --> 00:34:07,450
community structure for soils and grapes

636
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:09,889
and natural vegetation

637
00:34:07,450 --> 00:34:11,990
impacted soil microbial community

638
00:34:09,889 --> 00:34:18,639
structure in terms of the bacteria and

639
00:34:11,989 --> 00:34:23,119
also the fungi and fermentation stage

640
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:24,980
was the only factor there to trigger the

641
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:28,400
simple clustering on the two-dimensional

642
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:31,340
sorting but not the treatments

643
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:35,860
so the overall wine sensory properties

644
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:41,090
would not impacted by our underlying

645
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:44,300
soil treatments here an in conclusion

646
00:34:41,090 --> 00:34:46,190
for our the whole study the undermined

647
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:49,539
soil management did not impact on plant

648
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:53,030
growth yelled or the simple berry

649
00:34:49,539 --> 00:34:56,090
composition parameters of the mature

650
00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:58,460
Racine vine aim finger lakes and natural

651
00:34:56,090 --> 00:35:00,769
vegetation generally improve of soil

652
00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:03,610
health as you can see that the parameter

653
00:35:00,769 --> 00:35:05,989
we use soil aggregation organic matter

654
00:35:03,610 --> 00:35:09,410
microbial respiration rate and covering

655
00:35:05,989 --> 00:35:13,729
the rise ability were all in

656
00:35:09,409 --> 00:35:16,239
by using a natural vegetation in terms

657
00:35:13,730 --> 00:35:19,190
of micro microbial community that

658
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:23,298
undermine soil measurement impact on the

659
00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:26,298
soil bacterial and fungal community but

660
00:35:23,298 --> 00:35:28,759
that effect did not reflect on what's on

661
00:35:26,298 --> 00:35:32,358
a grape and what's in the wine

662
00:35:28,759 --> 00:35:34,519
fermentation so overall speaking there

663
00:35:32,358 --> 00:35:38,869
are no detection on the wine sensor

664
00:35:34,518 --> 00:35:42,288
sensory properties no matter is through

665
00:35:38,869 --> 00:35:44,000
the conventional winemaking no is

666
00:35:42,289 --> 00:35:48,710
through simulated a spontaneous

667
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:50,719
fermentation so that's uh that's my

668
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:53,809
study and there's so many people I

669
00:35:50,719 --> 00:35:56,538
wanted to thank through my study here at

670
00:35:53,809 --> 00:35:58,519
Cornell so firstly I want to thank you

671
00:35:56,539 --> 00:36:00,559
short rake Point winery because they

672
00:35:58,518 --> 00:36:02,929
provide me the land to use in to do the

673
00:36:00,559 --> 00:36:05,329
research and they do everything they

674
00:36:02,929 --> 00:36:10,338
could to support us and I want to thank

675
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:13,400
Steve lurch are a field of sister field

676
00:36:10,338 --> 00:36:17,268
technician and assistant and the people

677
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:20,389
at Geneva brewing and winemaking lat and

678
00:36:17,268 --> 00:36:23,028
also my previous and my current lab

679
00:36:20,389 --> 00:36:26,989
mates like Adam caribou standing right

680
00:36:23,028 --> 00:36:31,329
there and also my committee member Anna

681
00:36:26,989 --> 00:36:35,298
Katherine Mansfield Jenny Kahn -

682
00:36:31,329 --> 00:36:41,109
Johannes Lehmann and most important of

683
00:36:35,298 --> 00:36:44,869
all my major advisor Justine venerable

684
00:36:41,108 --> 00:36:47,389
who not only helped me through my

685
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:48,380
research and also make me a much better

686
00:36:47,389 --> 00:36:51,278
person

687
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:51,278
thank you

688
00:36:55,639 --> 00:37:06,000
I'm going to take questions we'll start

689
00:36:59,130 --> 00:37:09,720
from Geneva and I was just ok

690
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:12,269
Geneva do you have any questions you may

691
00:37:09,719 --> 00:37:15,649
engage just wondering if you can

692
00:37:12,269 --> 00:37:19,469
describe what your natural vegetation

693
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:21,720
treatments look like for the weeds three

694
00:37:19,469 --> 00:37:25,609
feet tall 6 feet tall was there any

695
00:37:21,719 --> 00:37:25,609
attempt to control or mow

696
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:36,329
okay so in 2014 because there there's

697
00:37:32,610 --> 00:37:38,550
some you know the herbicide procedures

698
00:37:36,329 --> 00:37:42,449
in the soil so that that so the lease

699
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:46,500
were not growing so well however they

700
00:37:42,449 --> 00:37:50,279
got like around 80 centimeter to a meter

701
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:53,670
tall and we bet we didn't have to molten

702
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:55,800
down in 2014 but in 2015 they got really

703
00:37:53,670 --> 00:37:59,340
tall so we had to mow them down like

704
00:37:55,800 --> 00:38:03,350
twice in the season so like maximum that

705
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:07,920
for what I can remember they can get to

706
00:38:03,349 --> 00:38:10,259
around mice in height as me so yeah as

707
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:12,090
you can get really high really tell for

708
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:14,700
those especially milk weeds we saw a lot

709
00:38:12,090 --> 00:38:18,180
of milk weeds echo really tall in 2015

710
00:38:14,699 --> 00:38:21,689
in 2016 they're not that aggressive but

711
00:38:18,179 --> 00:38:25,379
we had two more than down once in very

712
00:38:21,690 --> 00:38:34,530
late season does that answer your

713
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:37,550
question thank you thank you sorry

714
00:38:34,530 --> 00:38:41,430
do we go for Jeanne poppin shorty okay

715
00:38:37,550 --> 00:38:44,910
so please really enjoy your talk I

716
00:38:41,429 --> 00:38:46,679
noticed in many of your analyses years

717
00:38:44,909 --> 00:38:49,710
seem very different you might find a

718
00:38:46,679 --> 00:38:52,319
significant result in 2050 or the first

719
00:38:49,710 --> 00:38:54,690
year but not the second what do you

720
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:56,880
attribute that kind of variation to I

721
00:38:54,690 --> 00:38:59,909
know it was a drier year but as there

722
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:02,760
are other sounding factors or how do you

723
00:38:59,909 --> 00:39:05,969
make sense out of the big year

724
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:08,960
differences you saw so yeah yes I would

725
00:39:05,969 --> 00:39:11,578
consider climate

726
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:13,289
being the most important factor there

727
00:39:11,579 --> 00:39:15,950
and but there's a lot more than just

728
00:39:13,289 --> 00:39:20,849
climbing so if you look at different

729
00:39:15,949 --> 00:39:22,469
treatments the Wiis growing is is really

730
00:39:20,849 --> 00:39:25,440
different amount a year because of the

731
00:39:22,469 --> 00:39:27,598
climate and also because of the disease

732
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:29,579
pressure that different year to year so

733
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:34,190
the like a spraying program are very

734
00:39:29,579 --> 00:39:37,650
different and the way the vineyard crew

735
00:39:34,190 --> 00:39:39,630
managed vineyard were different but i

736
00:39:37,650 --> 00:39:41,309
would say the most important factor

737
00:39:39,630 --> 00:39:43,920
there is because of the climate that

738
00:39:41,309 --> 00:39:47,460
triggers the different weed pressure

739
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:59,818
different disease pressure so that

740
00:39:47,460 --> 00:40:01,318
resulting a very different data you know

741
00:39:59,818 --> 00:40:03,358
to what extent do you think there's any

742
00:40:01,318 --> 00:40:06,170
motivation then for mature you know

743
00:40:03,358 --> 00:40:08,728
vineyard managers with mature vineyards

744
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:11,338
to work towards improving soil health

745
00:40:08,728 --> 00:40:14,159
you did since beginning maybe less

746
00:40:11,338 --> 00:40:16,880
leaching of nutrients and pesticides

747
00:40:14,159 --> 00:40:20,129
with their bead to understand are they

748
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:23,039
fertilizing and the state on losses and

749
00:40:20,130 --> 00:40:26,460
what about self-compassion drink is that

750
00:40:23,039 --> 00:40:28,769
does that matter to them how are your

751
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:30,960
manager is gonna respond to this yeah

752
00:40:28,768 --> 00:40:33,919
this is a very good question so Jeff and

753
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:36,449
repeat okay so the question is what's

754
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:38,729
what's the incentive for the growers to

755
00:40:36,449 --> 00:40:42,298
to use different sort of mentioned

756
00:40:38,728 --> 00:40:49,949
practice because and because basically

757
00:40:42,298 --> 00:40:54,929
we see no difference is that okay yeah

758
00:40:49,949 --> 00:40:58,739
so so so if we think of it another way

759
00:40:54,929 --> 00:41:01,139
around if there's no impact on the yield

760
00:40:58,739 --> 00:41:03,048
or the sensory property why not doing

761
00:41:01,139 --> 00:41:06,239
something that is better for your soil

762
00:41:03,048 --> 00:41:08,038
right so if you adopt a natural

763
00:41:06,239 --> 00:41:10,619
vegetation and you're improving your

764
00:41:08,039 --> 00:41:13,799
soil health that they give that yourself

765
00:41:10,619 --> 00:41:18,298
more resilience to biotic or abiotic

766
00:41:13,798 --> 00:41:23,179
stress then it's it's a good thing for

767
00:41:18,298 --> 00:41:23,179
yourself and for the long term long term

768
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:26,739
sustainability in terms of financial

769
00:41:25,449 --> 00:41:29,349
sustainability and also the

770
00:41:26,739 --> 00:41:30,909
environmental sustainability and no

771
00:41:29,349 --> 00:41:32,890
matter what you do you're not impacting

772
00:41:30,909 --> 00:41:36,368
on guilt and also not impacting on the

773
00:41:32,889 --> 00:41:39,248
sensory property so so why not so I

774
00:41:36,369 --> 00:41:41,528
think if it's it there would be no like

775
00:41:39,248 --> 00:41:46,509
short turn come over for doing those

776
00:41:41,528 --> 00:41:49,958
kind of practice hallo baby look at it

777
00:41:46,509 --> 00:41:54,248
in the long run it is a good thing for

778
00:41:49,958 --> 00:41:57,759
not protecting your soil also protecting

779
00:41:54,248 --> 00:42:00,068
clean water because you know if those

780
00:41:57,759 --> 00:42:03,068
that the nutrients and pesticides into a

781
00:42:00,068 --> 00:42:05,978
waterway that what gets into our

782
00:42:03,068 --> 00:42:10,798
drinking water and or into the lakes and

783
00:42:05,978 --> 00:42:14,909
it's not good for for those perspectives

784
00:42:10,798 --> 00:42:20,288
to answer your question thank you okay

785
00:42:14,909 --> 00:42:24,098
you mentioned and so it seems like from

786
00:42:20,289 --> 00:42:26,650
your data you disprove that so I'm

787
00:42:24,099 --> 00:42:29,229
wondering is it worth going into that

788
00:42:26,650 --> 00:42:31,838
anymore or you kind of feel like it's a

789
00:42:29,228 --> 00:42:33,428
bit explored enough and it's really just

790
00:42:31,838 --> 00:42:36,728
something that sounds nice that doesn't

791
00:42:33,429 --> 00:42:40,630
exist so the thing is I'm just testing

792
00:42:36,728 --> 00:42:43,509
in our region so it is I will say is

793
00:42:40,630 --> 00:42:46,269
very region specific because a previous

794
00:42:43,509 --> 00:42:48,548
study have shown that vineyard and claim

795
00:42:46,268 --> 00:42:51,818
is playing a major factor there and also

796
00:42:48,548 --> 00:42:55,478
we proved that as well so in our region

797
00:42:51,818 --> 00:42:58,298
specifically what are the obstacles

798
00:42:55,478 --> 00:43:00,848
they're preventing the microbe bill to

799
00:42:58,298 --> 00:43:04,389
war to happen is that we have a really

800
00:43:00,849 --> 00:43:06,609
really big bang so our vines are huge so

801
00:43:04,389 --> 00:43:09,568
that the barrenness spatial barrier from

802
00:43:06,608 --> 00:43:12,009
the soil to the grape is really far away

803
00:43:09,568 --> 00:43:14,469
so even though we have a changing the

804
00:43:12,009 --> 00:43:16,449
micro microbial community in the soil it

805
00:43:14,469 --> 00:43:18,548
is very hard first of all is very hard

806
00:43:16,449 --> 00:43:23,170
to get into the fruiting zone compared

807
00:43:18,548 --> 00:43:26,170
to that say in in France in Burgundy in

808
00:43:23,170 --> 00:43:31,150
Champagne they have their vines are

809
00:43:26,170 --> 00:43:33,548
maybe 30 40 50 centimeter tall so it's

810
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:35,499
very their cluster are just hanging next

811
00:43:33,548 --> 00:43:36,460
to the soil and there have been studies

812
00:43:35,498 --> 00:43:39,519
showing that

813
00:43:36,460 --> 00:43:44,530
that the mobility of the microbes in the

814
00:43:39,519 --> 00:43:47,559
soil - to the air it's about four for a

815
00:43:44,530 --> 00:43:50,680
fungi especially is around 15 centimeter

816
00:43:47,559 --> 00:43:53,949
so it's really difficult for us to for

817
00:43:50,679 --> 00:43:58,059
the fine china so to move a metre or a

818
00:43:53,949 --> 00:44:00,579
meter 20 centimeter tall to our fruiting

819
00:43:58,059 --> 00:44:03,279
zone so that really prevents those who

820
00:44:00,579 --> 00:44:05,588
show up in our study and also as I've

821
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:08,890
mentioned that we had very high disease

822
00:44:05,588 --> 00:44:10,929
pressure so we had to spray so many

823
00:44:08,889 --> 00:44:12,699
times in a year and even there's

824
00:44:10,929 --> 00:44:15,219
something getting to including zone it

825
00:44:12,699 --> 00:44:21,460
will very hard for them to either thrive

826
00:44:15,219 --> 00:44:25,389
or to be able to to be alive in the

827
00:44:21,460 --> 00:44:29,230
grapes and then for us to capture it so

828
00:44:25,389 --> 00:44:33,279
I was saying in our specific region here

829
00:44:29,230 --> 00:44:36,490
it is difficult to see and there's those

830
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:39,820
those reasons but it cannot be applied

831
00:44:36,489 --> 00:44:45,329
to you everywhere in this world it's

832
00:44:39,820 --> 00:44:45,330
really region from region difference is

833
00:44:45,780 --> 00:44:56,200
contributing to that microbial to our

834
00:44:48,190 --> 00:45:04,300
thing Thank You microbes they get on the

835
00:44:56,199 --> 00:45:07,389
outside of the field manipulations yes

836
00:45:04,300 --> 00:45:09,789
you that's you have mentioned most of

837
00:45:07,389 --> 00:45:12,159
the the reason and also like the rain

838
00:45:09,789 --> 00:45:14,829
splash they're studying being show that

839
00:45:12,159 --> 00:45:17,649
the rain splash is playing a playing the

840
00:45:14,829 --> 00:45:22,989
road there and also the the wind is

841
00:45:17,650 --> 00:45:29,260
playing the road there and also like

842
00:45:22,989 --> 00:45:47,379
human as vector to distribute it's also

843
00:45:29,260 --> 00:45:50,550
very important or like so if you could

844
00:45:47,380 --> 00:45:50,550
just explain to people

845
00:45:51,318 --> 00:45:59,880
okay so micro pietà part is so testified

846
00:45:56,250 --> 00:46:05,250
to our furs and I try not to be too big

847
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:09,838
um tewara is a is basically the sense of

848
00:46:05,250 --> 00:46:12,510
the place in the wine that's why we

849
00:46:09,838 --> 00:46:17,429
called it also you expect even the same

850
00:46:12,510 --> 00:46:20,160
grapes with the same winemaking

851
00:46:17,429 --> 00:46:23,219
techniques people would expect it

852
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:25,558
differently if you get a California

853
00:46:23,219 --> 00:46:27,929
Pinot Noir or a Finger Lake Pinot Noir

854
00:46:25,559 --> 00:46:31,079
so that gives you a sense of place so

855
00:46:27,929 --> 00:46:35,190
that's the turn up to warrant means and

856
00:46:31,079 --> 00:46:38,250
micro biota warrant is that the what

857
00:46:35,190 --> 00:46:39,329
role does microbes play to give you that

858
00:46:38,250 --> 00:47:09,750
sense of place

859
00:46:39,329 --> 00:47:12,480
so micro po2 are is yeah I think it's

860
00:47:09,750 --> 00:47:15,269
it's worth looking today and we do have

861
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:18,929
like a spring schedule and what kind of

862
00:47:15,269 --> 00:47:20,969
thought substance they use but for the

863
00:47:18,929 --> 00:47:23,669
harvest so a lot of data were analyzed

864
00:47:20,969 --> 00:47:27,088
at harvest or the same were taken at

865
00:47:23,670 --> 00:47:30,990
harvest before harvest is basically

866
00:47:27,088 --> 00:47:35,219
there's about a week of window with sell

867
00:47:30,989 --> 00:47:37,949
spring right so basically there it's

868
00:47:35,219 --> 00:47:41,279
it's the same so I wouldn't say there

869
00:47:37,949 --> 00:47:54,769
would be so much of a interaction for

870
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:54,769
that Thanks okay yeah okay

871
00:47:59,570 --> 00:48:05,809
so you were saying the microbes travel

872
00:48:02,150 --> 00:48:11,960
via air is it not going through the root

873
00:48:05,809 --> 00:48:16,279
system and that is a yes so her question

874
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:19,220
is this microbes only travel through the

875
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:21,980
air does it not travel through the plan

876
00:48:19,219 --> 00:48:26,019
and the answer is yes it does travel

877
00:48:21,980 --> 00:48:29,210
through the plane so there's a lot of

878
00:48:26,019 --> 00:48:30,710
the especially bacteria there's a lot of

879
00:48:29,210 --> 00:48:34,309
them made into the plants and that

880
00:48:30,710 --> 00:48:36,440
triggers the second plant or the vine

881
00:48:34,309 --> 00:48:39,170
and grapes secondary metabolites a

882
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:42,050
synthesis so yes there's a lot of those

883
00:48:39,170 --> 00:48:44,720
and that's I think that's important for

884
00:48:42,050 --> 00:48:47,180
our next step to see so now we see that

885
00:48:44,719 --> 00:48:50,329
it's not impacting the wine sensory

886
00:48:47,179 --> 00:48:52,849
properties and what is there to trigger

887
00:48:50,329 --> 00:48:55,670
the wine sensory differences in the end

888
00:48:52,849 --> 00:48:58,309
of very study a very first study I

889
00:48:55,670 --> 00:49:00,950
showed so we can really look into those

890
00:48:58,309 --> 00:49:03,529
endophytes to see if they are playing

891
00:49:00,949 --> 00:49:08,949
the trick here to really make the wine

892
00:49:03,530 --> 00:49:08,950
sensory properties different thank you

893
