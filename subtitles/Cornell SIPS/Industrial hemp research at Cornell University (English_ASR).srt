2
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:09,830
industrial hemp research was authorized

3
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:11,810
in the 2014 farm bill Cornell as the

4
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:14,719
land-grant University in New York State

5
00:00:11,810 --> 00:00:17,179
picked up very quickly to begin a pilot

6
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:20,000
program we started our hemp research in

7
00:00:17,179 --> 00:00:22,730
the middle of the 2016 growing season

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,210
but really it took off in the 2017

9
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:27,530
growing season I was also asked by New

10
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:29,539
York State AG and markets in the

11
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:32,719
governor's office to lead an initiative

12
00:00:29,539 --> 00:00:34,520
to plant 1,700 acres that support from

13
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:36,620
the governor's office and the

14
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:38,810
legislature in Ag and markets has really

15
00:00:36,619 --> 00:00:41,149
put New York at the forefront of hemp

16
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:44,420
research in the country my research in

17
00:00:41,149 --> 00:00:46,429
particular is to evaluate existing hemp

18
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:48,500
cultivars for their suitability in New

19
00:00:46,429 --> 00:00:50,869
York conditions to be able to advise

20
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:52,789
farmers as to the best cultivars for

21
00:00:50,869 --> 00:00:55,189
them to grow as they get started in the

22
00:00:52,789 --> 00:00:57,229
hemp industry but also we're initiating

23
00:00:55,189 --> 00:00:59,179
a long term and breeding program to

24
00:00:57,229 --> 00:01:01,279
develop cultivars that are adapted for

25
00:00:59,179 --> 00:01:02,899
New York conditions Cornell has

26
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:05,750
assembled a strong multidisciplinary

27
00:01:02,899 --> 00:01:08,329
team of hemp researchers we're really

28
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:10,250
trying to cover all of the bases of hemp

29
00:01:08,329 --> 00:01:12,140
research in the multidisciplinary

30
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:14,239
expertise that we have in the school of

31
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:16,700
integrated plant science at Cornell the

32
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:19,280
hemp industry overall has grown by leaps

33
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:21,650
and bounds across the country New York

34
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:23,689
is one of the leaders in hemp research

35
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:27,049
in the country

36
00:01:23,689 --> 00:01:27,048
