1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:05,160
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:12,058
University

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:15,179
so Mike Scanlon say hi Mike and I are

4
00:00:12,058 --> 00:00:17,309
really really happy to be here today for

5
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:21,990
the undergraduate symposium for the

6
00:00:17,309 --> 00:00:25,739
Plant Sciences majors and Friends where

7
00:00:21,989 --> 00:00:29,189
we had a fantastic class this year our

8
00:00:25,739 --> 00:00:30,839
plant science 4950 course all of these

9
00:00:29,189 --> 00:00:32,219
students were involved in the class they

10
00:00:30,839 --> 00:00:34,259
worked really hard putting their

11
00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:38,010
presentations together and we're happy

12
00:00:34,259 --> 00:00:40,888
to have everyone here today to see the

13
00:00:38,009 --> 00:00:42,539
results of not only the hard work during

14
00:00:40,889 --> 00:00:44,670
class to put this presentation together

15
00:00:42,539 --> 00:00:46,558
but the results of the research and

16
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:49,039
extension experiences that our students

17
00:00:46,558 --> 00:00:52,548
have had that both Mike and I find to be

18
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:52,548
amazing and inspiring

19
00:00:54,948 --> 00:00:58,878
firing the first thought today is

20
00:00:57,679 --> 00:01:01,698
actually not from one of our

21
00:00:58,878 --> 00:01:04,158
undergraduates but from the recipient of

22
00:01:01,698 --> 00:01:07,640
the celibate fellowship yes

23
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:10,759
selling fellowship sorry

24
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:12,618
grant Thompson and that fellowship grant

25
00:01:10,759 --> 00:01:15,379
will talk about a little bit but it's

26
00:01:12,618 --> 00:01:17,269
about undergraduate mentoring and grant

27
00:01:15,379 --> 00:01:20,060
is a graduate student in Jenny Cohn

28
00:01:17,269 --> 00:01:21,978
difference allowed and he will be

29
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:24,560
actually starting an assistant professor

30
00:01:21,978 --> 00:01:26,599
position at Iowa State University fairly

31
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:30,679
soon about which he is not in any way

32
00:01:26,599 --> 00:01:33,559
nervous grants undergraduate student

33
00:01:30,679 --> 00:01:35,840
that he worked with is Michelle Chen and

34
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:38,329
the two of them to get today will give

35
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:40,368
us a brief overview of the work that

36
00:01:38,329 --> 00:01:41,840
they did and then we'll begin the

37
00:01:40,368 --> 00:01:45,170
students that were involved in our class

38
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:57,709
so grant and Michelle please come on up

39
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:59,629
and the clicker should work the title is

40
00:01:57,709 --> 00:02:02,020
reflections on mentoring a learning

41
00:01:59,629 --> 00:02:04,938
laboratory for grads and undergrads

42
00:02:02,019 --> 00:02:10,099
thank you very much for the introduction

43
00:02:04,938 --> 00:02:11,358
so I'm grant Thompson and as was

44
00:02:10,099 --> 00:02:13,430
mentioned the title for this is

45
00:02:11,359 --> 00:02:15,489
reflecting on mentoring learning

46
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:17,620
laboratory for grads and undergrads and

47
00:02:15,489 --> 00:02:20,509
so I'll give a little bit of background

48
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:23,180
over all talk a little about the solu

49
00:02:20,509 --> 00:02:24,769
fellowship and mentoring it's it's

50
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:26,959
really more than just the research that

51
00:02:24,769 --> 00:02:28,909
we've done together give some of my

52
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:30,439
perspectives and Michelle will give hers

53
00:02:28,909 --> 00:02:32,289
on it and kind of the important

54
00:02:30,439 --> 00:02:34,969
experiences we've walked away from this

55
00:02:32,289 --> 00:02:36,919
the research which you actually won't be

56
00:02:34,969 --> 00:02:39,439
hearing a whole lot about is part of the

57
00:02:36,919 --> 00:02:41,988
Baltimore ecosystem study so this is an

58
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:44,539
experiment or it's part of a longer

59
00:02:41,989 --> 00:02:47,840
running experiment looking at land use

60
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:51,590
change in urban grasslands and how that

61
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:53,180
is affecting soil micro biomes and kind

62
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:55,849
of the various controls on that that we

63
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:57,739
see and this work that we've done

64
00:02:55,849 --> 00:02:59,539
together has been supported by a

65
00:02:57,739 --> 00:03:01,280
generous donation of the cella family

66
00:02:59,539 --> 00:03:05,019
for the excellence in mentoring

67
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:08,390
fellowship so it was endowed by mark and

68
00:03:05,019 --> 00:03:12,200
Lisa sellou of prides corner farms

69
00:03:08,389 --> 00:03:14,089
it's $50,000 annually to one recipient a

70
00:03:12,199 --> 00:03:17,389
graduate student in each of the five

71
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:19,280
sections of sips and it's for students

72
00:03:17,389 --> 00:03:21,669
who have demonstrated previous and

73
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:24,409
ongoing commitment to mentoring of

74
00:03:21,669 --> 00:03:26,000
undergraduate researchers it's been

75
00:03:24,409 --> 00:03:28,400
really critical for me this past year

76
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,620
for the support that I've had both in

77
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,969
finishing my dissertation in working

78
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:35,689
with Michelle and it's just been a

79
00:03:31,969 --> 00:03:36,830
fantastic experience and so as I've

80
00:03:35,689 --> 00:03:38,419
mentioned it's more than just the

81
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:40,370
research of course there's all of the

82
00:03:38,419 --> 00:03:43,369
training that goes along into it

83
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:46,580
showing Michelle how to do PCR take lab

84
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:49,069
knows amplified DNA quantify what we've

85
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:51,380
had but it's also a process of building

86
00:03:49,069 --> 00:03:53,120
relationships and inspiring the next

87
00:03:51,379 --> 00:03:56,900
generation students who are going out

88
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:59,330
into research careers into academia into

89
00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:02,120
wherever life takes them after Cornell

90
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:03,890
and what this has been able to do is

91
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:05,569
have allow any kind of a more focused

92
00:04:03,889 --> 00:04:07,250
and intentional approach to what I've

93
00:04:05,569 --> 00:04:10,039
been doing in the lab for years working

94
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:11,780
with undergraduate students and so we've

95
00:04:10,039 --> 00:04:13,909
had a series of regular weekly meetings

96
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:16,579
checking in and seeing about progress

97
00:04:13,909 --> 00:04:20,418
talking about pitfalls troubleshooting

98
00:04:16,579 --> 00:04:22,668
hurdles etc as a graduate student most

99
00:04:20,418 --> 00:04:24,469
of the time I'm focused on the research

100
00:04:22,668 --> 00:04:26,870
end of things communicating my science

101
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:29,090
to my peers to my advisers at

102
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:31,728
conferences talking to extension

103
00:04:29,089 --> 00:04:34,250
audiences so really working with an

104
00:04:31,728 --> 00:04:36,139
undergraduate researcher has forced me

105
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:38,509
to kind of slow down reflect and think

106
00:04:36,139 --> 00:04:40,909
about my own science about how I

107
00:04:38,509 --> 00:04:42,829
approach things that may be now it's

108
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:44,419
kind of not automatic but certainly

109
00:04:42,829 --> 00:04:46,550
ingrained in me that I don't kind of

110
00:04:44,418 --> 00:04:48,109
think about those things as much anymore

111
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:51,290
it's also given me a lot of really

112
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:52,879
valuable lessons in terms of what is

113
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:54,890
appropriate goal-setting how do you

114
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:58,279
motivate a student experiencing

115
00:04:54,889 --> 00:05:00,050
challenges in the lab how do they move

116
00:04:58,279 --> 00:05:02,269
forward with their own time management

117
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:05,660
so it's really a lot about leadership

118
00:05:02,269 --> 00:05:07,039
and people skills and you know frankly

119
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:08,510
admitting when things aren't always

120
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:10,550
doing well you know if we're having

121
00:05:08,509 --> 00:05:12,978
trouble in the lab okay what's what's

122
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:15,500
not working what can I do to change that

123
00:05:12,978 --> 00:05:16,939
and so I think that's a really important

124
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:20,149
thing that I've walked away from this

125
00:05:16,939 --> 00:05:21,579
experience with and it's really company

126
00:05:20,149 --> 00:05:23,859
form and

127
00:05:21,579 --> 00:05:25,419
kind of solidified my teaching mentoring

128
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:27,310
philosophies which I've had to

129
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:29,020
articulate quite a few times over the

130
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:32,439
past years I've applied for different

131
00:05:29,019 --> 00:05:34,659
professors positions in various

132
00:05:32,439 --> 00:05:37,060
institutions and I've had a lot of

133
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:39,130
really fantastic mentors in my career so

134
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:42,100
it's really been an opportunity for me

135
00:05:39,129 --> 00:05:43,990
to pay it forward and give back working

136
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:49,090
very closely with Michelle as well as

137
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:51,189
undergrads that I haven't asked I'm here

138
00:05:49,089 --> 00:05:55,269
to talk about my experience with us um

139
00:05:51,189 --> 00:05:57,610
so primary or this is my second year

140
00:05:55,269 --> 00:06:00,579
inductee organism slips so primary uh

141
00:05:57,610 --> 00:06:03,310
prior to this I worked with all of the

142
00:06:00,579 --> 00:06:08,949
students um we have bunch of different

143
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:11,620
uh post PhD students um so what I really

144
00:06:08,949 --> 00:06:15,069
got to enjoy from this mentorship was

145
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:17,050
the ability to go beyond just working

146
00:06:15,069 --> 00:06:19,839
with like bouncing off different

147
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:21,579
students really focusing and working

148
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:23,649
primarily with Grant on comes fresh

149
00:06:21,579 --> 00:06:28,779
shots at the black square lawn study and

150
00:06:23,649 --> 00:06:31,419
so last semester I worked for his

151
00:06:28,779 --> 00:06:33,369
research and this lasted I got some sort

152
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:35,170
of had my own projects with us so I

153
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:36,850
really got to be in charge and

154
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:40,030
experience all the challenges and and

155
00:06:36,850 --> 00:06:41,950
joys of doing that um it was an

156
00:06:40,029 --> 00:06:43,959
opportunity for me to really see the

157
00:06:41,949 --> 00:06:46,569
bigger part in research like I don't

158
00:06:43,959 --> 00:06:48,789
have as much of a background in plant

159
00:06:46,569 --> 00:06:52,240
science so asking a questions how does

160
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:55,360
my work fit directly into his project

161
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:58,720
and into the figure box where lawn study

162
00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:00,370
seeing all of that sort of piece

163
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:03,790
together and like tell the bigger story

164
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:05,918
was really interesting journey uh and

165
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:09,100
also uh part of the mentorship was just

166
00:07:05,918 --> 00:07:10,870
asking him about like about research

167
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:13,270
about graduate student least you know

168
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:15,160
like t graduating with spring so I

169
00:07:13,269 --> 00:07:18,159
really got to see all of the work that

170
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:21,550
he plays with his dissertation his final

171
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:23,790
um I know like exams and his exit

172
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:25,930
ceremony so really getting to see

173
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:29,650
potentially if I really want to go into

174
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:31,750
research how might my like be and also

175
00:07:29,649 --> 00:07:32,629
just like developing like a relationship

176
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:34,430
with a mentor

177
00:07:32,629 --> 00:07:37,490
research that I might career in life

178
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:39,110
advice so I got to UM when I was

179
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:42,439
applying for internships earlier this

180
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:44,720
winter I talked to him about how to

181
00:07:42,439 --> 00:07:48,790
raise certain applications how to really

182
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:52,520
articulate my interest in my um my

183
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:58,280
creative layers and that actually works

184
00:07:52,519 --> 00:08:01,399
out really well and so just to wrap it

185
00:07:58,279 --> 00:08:02,959
up I think you know we all maybe take

186
00:08:01,399 --> 00:08:04,669
for granted or just kind of intuitively

187
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:07,039
understand the value of mentoring and

188
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:09,980
the support that it takes to be able to

189
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:11,569
provide good mentorship and I think it's

190
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:13,189
a fantastic opportunity for

191
00:08:11,569 --> 00:08:15,019
undergraduates and graduates I think we

192
00:08:13,189 --> 00:08:16,339
both have learned a ton from each other

193
00:08:15,019 --> 00:08:18,709
and just kind of going through the

194
00:08:16,339 --> 00:08:20,269
process of working together you know I

195
00:08:18,709 --> 00:08:22,279
think one of the important things when

196
00:08:20,269 --> 00:08:24,769
it comes to mentorship is not only the

197
00:08:22,279 --> 00:08:26,389
informal process but having people to

198
00:08:24,769 --> 00:08:29,269
check in with having kind of maybe a

199
00:08:26,389 --> 00:08:32,479
formalized way to get feedback about how

200
00:08:29,269 --> 00:08:34,038
mentoring can be improved and I've had

201
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:36,320
I've checked in with a number of people

202
00:08:34,038 --> 00:08:38,689
and just kind of done so informally but

203
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:41,270
I think any way that we can formalize

204
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:42,500
that moving forward would be good and I

205
00:08:41,269 --> 00:08:44,000
just really wanted to say thank you very

206
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:46,039
much to the sella family for their

207
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:50,210
support it's been fantastic this year

208
00:08:46,039 --> 00:08:52,610
and Michelle will be going to records

209
00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:54,590
this summer for a research experience

210
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:56,300
and as was already stated I'll be

211
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:58,120
joining Iowa State so certainly this

212
00:08:56,299 --> 00:09:01,779
experience has been really formative and

213
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:08,370
helping people think so - thank you

214
00:09:01,779 --> 00:09:08,370
[Applause]

215
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:20,970
the title of Rico sock is plant and

216
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:27,000
pathogen wars outside the cell the X DNA

217
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:30,840
X DNA's system so hi everyone

218
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:33,509
Andrey : and I'm a plant pathology

219
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:34,980
implant microbiology concentration today

220
00:09:33,509 --> 00:09:36,870
I'm going to present some of them work

221
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:39,960
at Professor Acadian today's lab

222
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:42,629
studying pongo genetics and genomics the

223
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:44,879
topic of my today's talk is hunt and

224
00:09:42,629 --> 00:09:47,220
pathogen worse outside the cell

225
00:09:44,879 --> 00:09:50,460
the actress all our DNA actors already

226
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:52,350
ate systems so when we talk about DNA we

227
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:55,110
usually think of it as a molecule that

228
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:57,090
carries genetic information and usually

229
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:59,580
resides in the nucleus or other work

230
00:09:57,090 --> 00:10:02,460
announced but this idea of intracellular

231
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:04,889
DNA it's radically overturned with the

232
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:07,680
discovery of the new fulfil actress our

233
00:10:04,889 --> 00:10:09,990
trap so you fulfill is a type of human

234
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:13,769
immune cell that normally looks like

235
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:15,389
this and when they encounter a microbial

236
00:10:13,769 --> 00:10:18,750
pathogens they can't flatter themselves

237
00:10:15,389 --> 00:10:22,080
and secrete in a outside the cell to

238
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:25,230
form this web-like material to trap a

239
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:27,720
microbial pathogen to immobilize them

240
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:30,600
and prevent them from further infection

241
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:33,690
and this mechanism is also actually

242
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:36,269
discovered in plants so it was

243
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:39,600
discovered that actress alert the MD&amp;A

244
00:10:36,269 --> 00:10:42,480
can be secreted by plant root tips and

245
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:45,330
what's shown here is that um julienne

246
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:49,409
rods and also pointed by the black arrow

247
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:52,800
is the pea root and showing in green is

248
00:10:49,409 --> 00:10:55,740
a fungal hyphae of a fungal a plant

249
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:59,279
fungal pathogen and pointed by the white

250
00:10:55,740 --> 00:11:02,190
arrows is a slime layer that's composed

251
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:05,059
of DNA and other proteins and this one

252
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:08,460
layer is separating the green of the

253
00:11:05,059 --> 00:11:11,159
fungal hyphae from approaching the plant

254
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:14,009
root tips to continue infection and when

255
00:11:11,159 --> 00:11:17,399
we treats this system was purely an h1

256
00:11:14,009 --> 00:11:19,889
on this will happen so the fungal this

257
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:22,289
slime layer will be loosened and the

258
00:11:19,889 --> 00:11:24,449
fungal hyphae can now penetrate through

259
00:11:22,289 --> 00:11:27,059
the DNA complex

260
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:28,710
reach the planter tip to cause a hundred

261
00:11:27,059 --> 00:11:33,029
percent root rot

262
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:36,090
so as a happens a lot between our host

263
00:11:33,029 --> 00:11:39,659
and passenger interactions when a plant

264
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:42,570
or or many hosts come up with the

265
00:11:39,659 --> 00:11:45,089
defense mechanism the pathogens always

266
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:48,210
comes up with the color defense in this

267
00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:51,509
case is the actress already being aided

268
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:54,240
by microbial pathogens so it was

269
00:11:51,509 --> 00:11:56,519
discovered that mammalian bacterial

270
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:58,830
pathogens can secretly in AIDS outside

271
00:11:56,519 --> 00:12:02,159
the cell to chew up these neutrophils

272
00:11:58,830 --> 00:12:04,830
secreted DNA and release themselves and

273
00:12:02,159 --> 00:12:07,589
then they can continue the infection and

274
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:09,870
the similar mechanism is also discovered

275
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:11,790
in plant bacterial pathogens that they

276
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:14,129
can secrete in AIDS outside the cells to

277
00:12:11,789 --> 00:12:16,889
chew up on the plant secrets

278
00:12:14,129 --> 00:12:19,889
access our DNA however there hasn't been

279
00:12:16,889 --> 00:12:22,169
any report on whether we're not fungal

280
00:12:19,889 --> 00:12:24,449
pathogen can seek reach actors are again

281
00:12:22,169 --> 00:12:27,389
aids as a counter defense against when

282
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:29,790
secreted actors are DNA so our lab is

283
00:12:27,389 --> 00:12:32,370
asking the question whether this counter

284
00:12:29,789 --> 00:12:34,769
defense mechanism is also present in the

285
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:37,080
plant fungal system and the model fungus

286
00:12:34,769 --> 00:12:39,419
that were using is Kokomo's Heather

287
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:41,340
office which is an epic traffic one

288
00:12:39,419 --> 00:12:44,969
pathogen that causes sodium currently

289
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:48,000
flood and to study the actors our DNA

290
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:51,120
system in cochlea Heather Chavez we use

291
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:53,279
bioinformatics force to generate 30

292
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:56,129
candidate genes that are encoding being

293
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:58,799
aids in the fungal genome and then if

294
00:12:56,129 --> 00:13:00,960
it's secure if this encoding actors are

295
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:03,089
being AIDS whether it is secreted when

296
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:06,180
all will be important so we analyze them

297
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:09,330
for secretion and picked on the ones was

298
00:13:06,179 --> 00:13:11,939
the predicted secretion signals and so

299
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:14,639
far we've analyzed our eight of them and

300
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:17,370
they are all marked in pink here and

301
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:19,620
among the eight had a moderate candidate

302
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:23,460
one was identified as important for

303
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:25,950
virulence and also of it had secreted

304
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:28,320
near AIDS activity which is marked in

305
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:31,350
green here and the protein IV of this

306
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:33,600
gene is one who for 206 and in my

307
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:36,990
project I am screaming another candidate

308
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:40,409
gene and the protein ID is one

309
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:41,519
to see if also encodes the actors are

310
00:13:40,409 --> 00:13:44,250
being Hg

311
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:46,528
so study this gene I generated mutants

312
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:49,440
with this tree and billiards in my

313
00:13:46,528 --> 00:13:52,950
fungus and firstly I performed a

314
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:55,200
Baroness sa inoculated corns with four

315
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:57,649
different strains the first one is well

316
00:13:55,200 --> 00:14:01,379
paid and also the second one as a

317
00:13:57,649 --> 00:14:04,919
positive control which is a mutant was

318
00:14:01,379 --> 00:14:08,039
the identified on security agent deleted

319
00:14:04,919 --> 00:14:11,189
Delta one point four to six and the rest

320
00:14:08,039 --> 00:14:14,219
- Azam the other two are my mutants that

321
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:18,270
are lacking my gene of interest 197 62

322
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:20,399
and I collected my collected Leafs of my

323
00:14:18,269 --> 00:14:23,220
infected corns and measured the legal

324
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:26,429
ends of every legions on the third leaf

325
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:31,080
out of my courts and used average legal

326
00:14:26,429 --> 00:14:32,939
ins as a criterium for virulence so as

327
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:35,550
you can see that this is a symptom of

328
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:37,230
course impacted by wall type and this is

329
00:14:35,549 --> 00:14:39,389
a zoom picture of what the Legion and

330
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:41,700
this is the symptoms caused by the

331
00:14:39,389 --> 00:14:44,789
positive control and as you can see and

332
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:46,528
based on statistical tasks the virulence

333
00:14:44,789 --> 00:14:48,990
of the mutants is significantly

334
00:14:46,528 --> 00:14:51,929
decreased compared to wall type however

335
00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:54,509
the difference of ruins between the well

336
00:14:51,929 --> 00:14:57,149
Kuip and shoe of my mutants wasn't

337
00:14:54,509 --> 00:15:00,299
significant which any case that is 197

338
00:14:57,149 --> 00:15:02,399
62 is likely not a variance factor or

339
00:15:00,299 --> 00:15:06,299
worse your interesting why whether this

340
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:08,909
one 97 6 or 2 is encoding an actress or

341
00:15:06,299 --> 00:15:11,129
gain 8 so I also performed a teenage

342
00:15:08,909 --> 00:15:13,500
activity test I cultivated the

343
00:15:11,129 --> 00:15:15,750
straightest and khalakka media from the

344
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:18,450
cultures and maize for suspension and

345
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:20,549
puts equal amounts of sports aspiration

346
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:23,190
into individual a keyboard cubes and

347
00:15:20,549 --> 00:15:25,559
added six surface sterilized core leaf

348
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:27,630
pieces of into worthless cube and

349
00:15:25,559 --> 00:15:29,250
incubated both of the tubes at room

350
00:15:27,629 --> 00:15:33,028
temperature with scheduled shaking for

351
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:35,039
three days after three day I centrifuge

352
00:15:33,028 --> 00:15:37,528
both of these cultures and use a few

353
00:15:35,039 --> 00:15:39,539
traits to treat lung that DNA to see if

354
00:15:37,528 --> 00:15:43,649
there's a difference between lung that

355
00:15:39,539 --> 00:15:46,708
neotec Astra so if the King is encoding

356
00:15:43,649 --> 00:15:49,889
for a DNA actress our teen AIDS this is

357
00:15:46,708 --> 00:15:50,989
the result that we're expecting so all

358
00:15:49,889 --> 00:15:53,809
the twelves campaign

359
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:56,778
that being a here and this is what long

360
00:15:53,809 --> 00:15:59,088
that a origin looks like without any

361
00:15:56,778 --> 00:16:02,240
treatment and when it's treated when

362
00:15:59,089 --> 00:16:03,709
steer is one they will there's um

363
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:05,659
there's nothing left

364
00:16:03,708 --> 00:16:07,849
oh when is treated with me an h1 and

365
00:16:05,659 --> 00:16:10,129
when they are treated with so welcome

366
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:12,709
children's as you can see that the love

367
00:16:10,129 --> 00:16:16,129
the DN a is no longer impact or less

368
00:16:12,708 --> 00:16:21,519
intact and indicating that the lambda

369
00:16:16,129 --> 00:16:24,230
DNA is digested and these two lines are

370
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:26,480
created with few traits of well type

371
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:29,750
culture cultivated with corn leaves and

372
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:32,000
these two are treated with cultures of

373
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:34,759
well type cultures without corn leaves

374
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:37,278
which in as you can see that there's an

375
00:16:34,759 --> 00:16:39,289
increased amount of DNA activity in

376
00:16:37,278 --> 00:16:41,269
these two lanes which indicates that

377
00:16:39,289 --> 00:16:43,819
there's an association between the

378
00:16:41,269 --> 00:16:48,319
presence of core leaves and also the

379
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:50,959
DNA's activity and when we treat lambda

380
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:53,990
P na with the positive control which are

381
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:56,119
mutants lacking one for 206 oh we can

382
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:57,889
see that compared to wall type there's a

383
00:16:56,120 --> 00:17:00,049
decreased amount of flubbed a DNA

384
00:16:57,889 --> 00:17:02,269
digestion indicating that this gene is

385
00:17:00,049 --> 00:17:05,029
encoding for an extrasolar being aids

386
00:17:02,269 --> 00:17:07,250
because lacking this gene will make a

387
00:17:05,029 --> 00:17:10,879
decrease the amount of the in a stash

388
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:13,308
via a digestion so I apply the same as a

389
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:16,490
to my Newtons and this is a result I've

390
00:17:13,308 --> 00:17:18,799
got so this is longer than a by itself

391
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:21,970
and when it's treated when spean is

392
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:25,549
purely and h1 and this is wall type and

393
00:17:21,970 --> 00:17:27,558
these last four lanes are my mute are

394
00:17:25,549 --> 00:17:30,740
treated with my mutants and as you can

395
00:17:27,558 --> 00:17:33,920
see there's no obvious decrease of AIDS

396
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:36,890
activity but however you might also

397
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:38,900
notice that in the positive control here

398
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:42,440
that there's also another obvious

399
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:44,300
decrease in a kinase activity which I

400
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:47,029
have to be honest that these tests are

401
00:17:44,299 --> 00:17:48,740
quite crude and there's variation

402
00:17:47,029 --> 00:17:50,779
between each trial indicating that

403
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:54,170
there's many feel of there's many

404
00:17:50,779 --> 00:17:56,119
unknown factors in our experimental

405
00:17:54,170 --> 00:17:58,340
design which are we are Co trying to

406
00:17:56,119 --> 00:18:00,289
improve but this is definitely not an

407
00:17:58,339 --> 00:18:02,509
easy task because there's little

408
00:18:00,289 --> 00:18:04,309
literature associated with filamentous

409
00:18:02,509 --> 00:18:06,049
fungi holding in a

410
00:18:04,309 --> 00:18:09,079
not to mention about functional analysis

411
00:18:06,049 --> 00:18:10,789
our definition tire and also this is now

412
00:18:09,079 --> 00:18:13,309
the end of story because I also

413
00:18:10,789 --> 00:18:16,490
performed a phylogenetic analysis of DNA

414
00:18:13,309 --> 00:18:18,589
encoding genes we identified using

415
00:18:16,490 --> 00:18:20,920
bioinformatics tool we identified the

416
00:18:18,589 --> 00:18:24,740
Versa locks of the identified on

417
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:27,560
secreted in asian cochlea almost 1.4 206

418
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:30,079
and found is worse about seeing other

419
00:18:27,559 --> 00:18:33,339
plant Hangul pathogens that has cochlear

420
00:18:30,079 --> 00:18:36,500
buzz victory which is a old pathogen and

421
00:18:33,339 --> 00:18:39,379
we're asking the question to what the

422
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:41,720
logs of 104 306 had similar or

423
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:43,640
functionally in other pathogens we're

424
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:46,160
asking whether it has a similar

425
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:49,190
functions in another pathogen that

426
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:51,350
infects another host and also in facts

427
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:53,860
another plant part because um see

428
00:18:51,349 --> 00:18:56,809
victory is actually a crown pathogen and

429
00:18:53,859 --> 00:18:59,449
I have generated the mutants of see

430
00:18:56,809 --> 00:19:01,250
victory lacking this ortholog and I am

431
00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:05,930
performing the Baroness essays on

432
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:09,079
recently so in conclusion according to

433
00:19:05,930 --> 00:19:11,570
our virulence has 1 9 7 6 3 q is likely

434
00:19:09,079 --> 00:19:14,809
not a burdens factor and according to

435
00:19:11,569 --> 00:19:18,259
our DNA ace has one i 762 might not be

436
00:19:14,809 --> 00:19:21,129
as secreted being 8 so we have a lot of

437
00:19:18,259 --> 00:19:23,450
future research going on one is that um

438
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:25,970
we are as I mentioned before we're

439
00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:28,190
improving the DNA SSA order to get more

440
00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:30,200
consistent result and secondly as I

441
00:19:28,190 --> 00:19:32,150
mentioned there's a association between

442
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:35,210
the presence of core leaves and the

443
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:37,280
increase in a stack tivity so what we're

444
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:40,370
asking whether the presence of core leaf

445
00:19:37,279 --> 00:19:42,079
is inducing on the DNA's activity or

446
00:19:40,369 --> 00:19:44,119
assistant Lee that because of the

447
00:19:42,079 --> 00:19:47,449
presence of core leaf there's better

448
00:19:44,119 --> 00:19:50,869
fungal growth also we have a lot more

449
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:54,319
candidates to analyze and many of them

450
00:19:50,869 --> 00:19:57,559
are Co are under current research and I

451
00:19:54,319 --> 00:20:00,859
am studying the water log of 104 12 6 in

452
00:19:57,559 --> 00:20:03,139
Coakley opps victory and I am saying the

453
00:20:00,859 --> 00:20:05,329
burdens of my mutants in recent days and

454
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:07,370
last but not least I also want to

455
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:09,980
mention that in the meantime of this

456
00:20:07,369 --> 00:20:13,129
project I also adapted CRISPR cosmicism

457
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:15,289
to Coakley out of las Heras coffers

458
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:17,900
and I'm improving this so that's in the

459
00:20:15,289 --> 00:20:20,629
future research hopefully we can use it

460
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:23,330
to study to do more sites the specific

461
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:27,050
research on functional analysis on the

462
00:20:23,329 --> 00:20:29,269
identified on DNA stream so I want to

463
00:20:27,049 --> 00:20:32,480
thank everyone in the Terkel lab

464
00:20:29,269 --> 00:20:35,180
especially my PI Gillan and also our

465
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:38,120
postdoc kitchen park who have been

466
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:40,279
helping me a lot and also who send all

467
00:20:38,119 --> 00:20:42,459
my funding sources the RC ARS program

468
00:20:40,279 --> 00:20:45,589
the Jim Grobe only primary research

469
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:47,509
award and Frederick Kepler memorial

470
00:20:45,589 --> 00:21:01,039
research endowments and now I would like

471
00:20:47,509 --> 00:21:04,089
to take questions questions for Rico so

472
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:08,869
one would expect that this phenomenon of

473
00:21:04,089 --> 00:21:12,319
being able to degrade our DNA as DNA is

474
00:21:08,869 --> 00:21:15,919
produced by root cups that would be

475
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:20,409
something more may be expressed in root

476
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:25,580
pathogens why did you choose to study a

477
00:21:20,410 --> 00:21:29,779
foliar pathogen so when we studied only

478
00:21:25,579 --> 00:21:32,539
first studied our identified actors RDH

479
00:21:29,779 --> 00:21:35,359
gene which is 1 for 12 6 we actually

480
00:21:32,539 --> 00:21:37,670
performed a root si

481
00:21:35,359 --> 00:21:40,879
um to evaluate surveillance and we also

482
00:21:37,670 --> 00:21:45,110
performed a polar I say by evaluating

483
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:48,440
the virulence on the plant feeds and

484
00:21:45,109 --> 00:21:50,599
both of them show sick decreased amount

485
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:53,000
of berlin so we're suspecting it could

486
00:21:50,599 --> 00:21:55,849
also be some Authority acre also be

487
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:58,849
secreted by um leaf and also cochlea bus

488
00:21:55,849 --> 00:22:00,889
has a surface although it's mostly a

489
00:21:58,849 --> 00:22:07,089
foliar pathogen but sometimes they can

490
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:07,090
also in fact roots other questions

491
00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:17,778
all right thanks

492
00:22:10,910 --> 00:22:17,778
[Applause]

493
00:22:19,569 --> 00:22:27,009
so next we have J Winans who will be

494
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:29,139
talking on phenotypic phenotypic

495
00:22:27,009 --> 00:22:31,389
variance and disease severity caused by

496
00:22:29,138 --> 00:22:36,519
Fusarium gramineae Arum sampled from

497
00:22:31,388 --> 00:22:38,949
wheat and wild grasses so this is the

498
00:22:36,519 --> 00:22:41,739
work 20% today is the work I did for my

499
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:44,288
honors thesis here I'm collected from

500
00:22:41,739 --> 00:22:46,298
Northeastern New York a little bit of

501
00:22:44,288 --> 00:22:49,450
background for our memory room it didn't

502
00:22:46,298 --> 00:22:51,608
ascomycete plant pathogen and wheat

503
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:53,528
barley and corn when it's infecting

504
00:22:51,608 --> 00:22:57,908
wheat and barley it causes we saw in

505
00:22:53,528 --> 00:23:01,269
head by week that's infected the white

506
00:22:57,909 --> 00:23:04,539
and bleached and the infected car and

507
00:23:01,269 --> 00:23:08,048
the molded area is the infected

508
00:23:04,538 --> 00:23:11,288
liberally rod that consumption of this

509
00:23:08,048 --> 00:23:13,179
fungus can lead to vomiting malnutrition

510
00:23:11,288 --> 00:23:15,009
a lot of health concerns for humans and

511
00:23:13,179 --> 00:23:17,320
livestock both and the reason for that

512
00:23:15,009 --> 00:23:19,118
because the mycotoxins this fungus

513
00:23:17,319 --> 00:23:21,519
produces so it produces a bunch of

514
00:23:19,118 --> 00:23:25,778
different mycotoxins on the right here I

515
00:23:21,519 --> 00:23:27,460
have the the six of them that isn't an

516
00:23:25,778 --> 00:23:29,618
inclusive list these are all incredibly

517
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:31,659
potent mycotoxins of one part per

518
00:23:29,618 --> 00:23:34,808
million and it's dangerous for people to

519
00:23:31,659 --> 00:23:36,009
consume them they're also pretty

520
00:23:34,808 --> 00:23:37,989
economically important because our

521
00:23:36,009 --> 00:23:40,058
environments one of the most

522
00:23:37,989 --> 00:23:42,340
economically important pathogens for

523
00:23:40,058 --> 00:23:44,378
wheat production and then 2014 it was

524
00:23:42,339 --> 00:23:45,819
estimated that a billion dollars were

525
00:23:44,378 --> 00:23:48,398
lost due to who saw him head blight

526
00:23:45,819 --> 00:23:49,808
based off of grade loss so there was

527
00:23:48,398 --> 00:23:51,928
enough micro toxins that you couldn't

528
00:23:49,808 --> 00:23:53,858
sell it for human consumption and

529
00:23:51,929 --> 00:23:55,899
livestock is only at ten parts per

530
00:23:53,858 --> 00:23:58,239
million so like it's pretty close to it

531
00:23:55,898 --> 00:23:59,648
once that you have infected grain

532
00:23:58,239 --> 00:24:07,499
there's very little you can do to get

533
00:23:59,648 --> 00:24:09,848
rid of it or get rid of the toxins the

534
00:24:07,499 --> 00:24:12,399
synthesis of micro toxins vary between

535
00:24:09,848 --> 00:24:15,460
populations so the Corn Belt is

536
00:24:12,398 --> 00:24:18,278
dominated by the 1581 phenotype or chemo

537
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:20,798
type sorry so normally a fungus isolate

538
00:24:18,278 --> 00:24:22,808
will produce one mycotoxin and fast

539
00:24:20,798 --> 00:24:24,190
quantities more than other ones or it'll

540
00:24:22,808 --> 00:24:27,098
only put this one at all and that's

541
00:24:24,190 --> 00:24:29,470
called its chemo type II upstate New

542
00:24:27,098 --> 00:24:31,148
York region has much more diversity in

543
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:33,309
micro toxins that are produced by

544
00:24:31,148 --> 00:24:36,399
isolates such as the nh-2

545
00:24:33,309 --> 00:24:39,819
three aton variety 1581 these are all

546
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:42,220
kind of more present in this region wild

547
00:24:39,819 --> 00:24:44,019
grasses are colonized by fruit sorry I'm

548
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:45,940
a symptomatically so you won't ever see

549
00:24:44,019 --> 00:24:48,369
the infected spikelets that I showed the

550
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:51,130
wheat when you're collecting off native

551
00:24:48,369 --> 00:24:53,979
grasses less like a talking accumulation

552
00:24:51,130 --> 00:24:56,140
of a program in your own weight it's

553
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:58,569
infecting wild grasses as well but the

554
00:24:56,140 --> 00:25:01,630
aggressiveness devices from different

555
00:24:58,569 --> 00:25:02,889
hosts organs are currently unclear so

556
00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:05,470
all this information in mind my

557
00:25:02,890 --> 00:25:08,440
questions was is there a significant

558
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:11,620
difference in the phenotype and zeal

559
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:13,420
aggressiveness when you sample for sorry

560
00:25:11,619 --> 00:25:15,489
I'm off of wild grasses and when you

561
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:16,900
sample for him off of wheat right so

562
00:25:15,490 --> 00:25:21,450
would you see a difference in chemo type

563
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:23,470
identified here at BCC information

564
00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:26,830
you're gonna get into the methods now

565
00:25:23,470 --> 00:25:28,150
the collection sites we had were in

566
00:25:26,829 --> 00:25:30,399
northeastern New York

567
00:25:28,150 --> 00:25:34,720
way past our culture most agriculture or

568
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:35,860
wheat is in on this area here so these

569
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,829
are the four different sites you go to

570
00:25:35,859 --> 00:25:41,379
and this is an enhanced version of the

571
00:25:37,829 --> 00:25:46,779
Willsboro research farm there are each

572
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:51,940
is a precise marking of a grass I salute

573
00:25:46,779 --> 00:25:55,240
that we grabbed and then from this part

574
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:58,509
we so in total we hit twenty I slits

575
00:25:55,240 --> 00:26:01,329
from grass eight from eight from soon

576
00:25:58,509 --> 00:26:04,569
from eight from Canary redress and four

577
00:26:01,329 --> 00:26:07,210
from Orchard and then 15 from wheat all

578
00:26:04,569 --> 00:26:08,889
clicking around here and then I ran into

579
00:26:07,210 --> 00:26:12,009
the greenhouse experiments this was a

580
00:26:08,890 --> 00:26:14,560
live host inoculations to test disease

581
00:26:12,009 --> 00:26:17,349
severity of incidence so in the

582
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:18,669
greenhouse I had two lab standard checks

583
00:26:17,349 --> 00:26:20,139
or I had to run three different

584
00:26:18,670 --> 00:26:23,259
inoculation ship because of spatial

585
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:24,430
restrictions in the greenhouse and so I

586
00:26:23,259 --> 00:26:28,000
would have knock you liked them and then

587
00:26:24,430 --> 00:26:30,759
every week or the next month I would go

588
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,380
back and I would predict take a incident

589
00:26:30,759 --> 00:26:35,289
since the very degrading just is the

590
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:38,050
disease there and if it is how bad is it

591
00:26:35,289 --> 00:26:39,609
and then on the fourth week I brought

592
00:26:38,049 --> 00:26:43,169
them all back to the lab brush them and

593
00:26:39,609 --> 00:26:45,519
then did a percentage of damage kernels

594
00:26:43,170 --> 00:26:47,170
get really orange and trebled compared

595
00:26:45,519 --> 00:26:51,009
to be

596
00:26:47,170 --> 00:26:54,039
I also did in lab correlation assay and

597
00:26:51,009 --> 00:26:56,200
of my Celia growth right so what I'm

598
00:26:54,039 --> 00:26:59,740
curtisha is the reproductive structures

599
00:26:56,200 --> 00:27:04,150
of Rosario and these are little black

600
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:06,940
dots and right here this is a celiac

601
00:27:04,150 --> 00:27:10,840
growth si just seeing after five days

602
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:12,070
how large of a colony did it produce so

603
00:27:10,839 --> 00:27:13,599
that was kind of the book methods never

604
00:27:12,069 --> 00:27:18,159
uncommon of the results so the chemo

605
00:27:13,599 --> 00:27:20,949
typing we found 15 3 aton mycotoxin if

606
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:25,300
18 1581 and won the Ballon all which is

607
00:27:20,950 --> 00:27:28,059
a pretty standard split or this area we

608
00:27:25,299 --> 00:27:30,159
collected it from chemo sites had no

609
00:27:28,059 --> 00:27:32,470
significant any the phenotypes observed

610
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:34,480
whether it be is for production I Celia

611
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:37,630
growth disease in the greenhouse and

612
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:40,059
damaged kernels however we did see was

613
00:27:37,630 --> 00:27:41,590
that the origin of the isolate so if you

614
00:27:40,059 --> 00:27:44,099
grabbed it from a grass isolate or from

615
00:27:41,589 --> 00:27:46,809
wheat that had a significant effect on

616
00:27:44,099 --> 00:27:49,779
whether it caused a lot of disease or

617
00:27:46,809 --> 00:27:51,639
less disease in the greenhouse and we

618
00:27:49,779 --> 00:27:53,500
see that we final disease rating I took

619
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:56,230
and so this graph right here this is

620
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:58,809
either a tomato and the Tsarevich

621
00:27:56,230 --> 00:27:59,769
kernels and that's the correlation just

622
00:27:58,809 --> 00:28:01,210
go just knowing about the two different

623
00:27:59,769 --> 00:28:03,639
ways I was meandering disease those are

624
00:28:01,210 --> 00:28:05,289
correlated be well and then this

625
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:06,700
regression line is for the grass eye

626
00:28:05,289 --> 00:28:11,109
slits and this one is for the weeks and

627
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:14,140
then this is what's interesting was that

628
00:28:11,109 --> 00:28:16,839
while this was significant the the storm

629
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:19,330
damage kernels was not related it was

630
00:28:16,839 --> 00:28:19,720
not significant but the place you took

631
00:28:19,329 --> 00:28:22,319
me

632
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:24,730
isolate from was not significant for

633
00:28:22,319 --> 00:28:26,200
predicting damaged kernels which is

634
00:28:24,730 --> 00:28:28,269
weird because Deena this is correlated

635
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:31,750
and this but that wasn't and I'm like

636
00:28:28,269 --> 00:28:36,970
because my theory is my bad I had would

637
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:44,259
be this one there was four four data

638
00:28:36,970 --> 00:28:46,299
points my steely-eyed pretty see a grill

639
00:28:44,259 --> 00:28:53,529
so I found a trend so this is not

640
00:28:46,299 --> 00:28:54,940
something to show that there is some

641
00:28:53,529 --> 00:28:57,599
sort of significance that if maybe with

642
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:59,500
a higher sample size we could see a

643
00:28:57,599 --> 00:29:00,219
significant effect what I think is

644
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:01,869
interesting

645
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:03,370
it does show that maybe there's a

646
00:29:01,869 --> 00:29:05,019
difference between whether you're

647
00:29:03,369 --> 00:29:06,459
growing larger or you're producing more

648
00:29:05,019 --> 00:29:09,359
spores like that could show that there's

649
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:11,288
a you know a difference in life patterns

650
00:29:09,359 --> 00:29:14,889
so the inflation of these results

651
00:29:11,288 --> 00:29:24,908
processes cause less disease host

652
00:29:14,890 --> 00:29:28,870
adaptation negative it's unimportant in

653
00:29:24,909 --> 00:29:30,760
colonizing of huge sweet hosts so for

654
00:29:28,869 --> 00:29:32,709
the research we were I'm going to move

655
00:29:30,759 --> 00:29:34,599
in Madison when that's not when these

656
00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:35,980
summer is over but before that I'll be

657
00:29:34,599 --> 00:29:39,730
working on the differentiation between

658
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:41,589
and excellence and realign excellence so

659
00:29:39,730 --> 00:29:44,980
on this trap which shown here is that

660
00:29:41,589 --> 00:29:48,069
these bars down here this is the reading

661
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:53,620
link this one is the 15 then this one

662
00:29:48,069 --> 00:29:55,599
appears however 381 and NX does not

663
00:29:53,619 --> 00:29:58,869
differentiate with this so I'm going to

664
00:29:55,599 --> 00:30:00,908
want to do that and see that larger

665
00:29:58,869 --> 00:30:02,408
sample size to see if very thieves

666
00:30:00,909 --> 00:30:04,539
deformation and might see a growth if

667
00:30:02,409 --> 00:30:05,710
those are different I think really do

668
00:30:04,538 --> 00:30:11,470
have a negative relation to each other

669
00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:13,419
good for me to see exactly how much

670
00:30:11,470 --> 00:30:15,759
mycotoxins are being produced by the

671
00:30:13,419 --> 00:30:22,840
grass ice or the grass I slipped when if

672
00:30:15,759 --> 00:30:25,150
I can wheat and the seedlings we tried

673
00:30:22,839 --> 00:30:26,529
this once but the for suspension was

674
00:30:25,150 --> 00:30:29,019
just it just destroyed completely

675
00:30:26,529 --> 00:30:35,440
destroyed every single seedling that we

676
00:30:29,019 --> 00:30:36,759
tried to inoculate I've been working

677
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:39,429
with for about two years now

678
00:30:36,759 --> 00:30:42,158
personal mentor of mine Jamie coming to

679
00:30:39,429 --> 00:30:44,950
be a great lab manager dr. Gary Bertram

680
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:46,240
who is my VI dr. Deniz acting here for

681
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:48,279
all the help of the statistics for this

682
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:51,220
thesis and Chad Thomas who helped me

683
00:30:48,279 --> 00:30:55,019
grow a house plants that'll make your

684
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:55,019
time and questions

685
00:30:56,940 --> 00:31:03,309
great job Jim curious is the what parts

686
00:31:02,049 --> 00:31:04,839
of the world where they grow we'd have

687
00:31:03,309 --> 00:31:08,019
the greatest problem which they're aimin

688
00:31:04,839 --> 00:31:10,809
what contributes to that being right so

689
00:31:08,019 --> 00:31:12,970
this arm is kind of a worldwide problem

690
00:31:10,809 --> 00:31:14,679
or in the United States most of my

691
00:31:12,970 --> 00:31:16,360
productions are screened for and then

692
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:18,279
are separated and not soul cream

693
00:31:16,359 --> 00:31:20,769
consumption in developing countries in

694
00:31:18,279 --> 00:31:22,930
Africa I know that this arm is a pretty

695
00:31:20,769 --> 00:31:24,309
big problem because it's not screened

696
00:31:22,930 --> 00:31:35,320
for well enough so people are ingesting

697
00:31:24,309 --> 00:31:37,869
infected grains other questions I should

698
00:31:35,319 --> 00:31:40,299
point out when you see the presenters

699
00:31:37,869 --> 00:31:42,039
smile it's because they're looking at my

700
00:31:40,299 --> 00:31:44,970
cry and they're talking about something

701
00:31:42,039 --> 00:31:48,819
that was discussed extensively in class

702
00:31:44,970 --> 00:31:51,730
and so far I have to say both presenters

703
00:31:48,819 --> 00:31:54,750
have done the best job of presentation

704
00:31:51,730 --> 00:31:54,750
today it was today so

705
00:31:59,798 --> 00:32:06,950
all right so next we have Kyra Archer

706
00:32:03,019 --> 00:32:12,168
and the title of Clara's talk if she

707
00:32:06,950 --> 00:32:15,080
didn't change it is role role and

708
00:32:12,169 --> 00:32:20,679
elucidation role elucidation of terpene

709
00:32:15,079 --> 00:32:20,678
synthase TPS - in maze a food defense

710
00:32:20,859 --> 00:32:27,319
can you hear me yeah so hi everyone I am

711
00:32:25,130 --> 00:32:29,120
a plant science major and also

712
00:32:27,319 --> 00:32:30,649
nutritional science major and this is a

713
00:32:29,119 --> 00:32:32,808
project that I did for my honors thesis

714
00:32:30,650 --> 00:32:35,630
and I'm happy to talk with you all about

715
00:32:32,808 --> 00:32:37,129
it today um so as Chris said I'm going

716
00:32:35,630 --> 00:32:41,390
to talk to you about a specific enzyme

717
00:32:37,130 --> 00:32:44,299
at TPS - and the role of this enzyme in

718
00:32:41,390 --> 00:32:48,288
Mays defense specifically against corn

719
00:32:44,298 --> 00:32:50,029
leaf a Fitz and green peach aphids so we

720
00:32:48,288 --> 00:32:53,029
all know that may is very important crop

721
00:32:50,029 --> 00:32:56,149
and unfortunately Mays experience is

722
00:32:53,029 --> 00:32:58,399
such a wide range of or bibury from bone

723
00:32:56,150 --> 00:32:59,679
feeding to chewing and stem boring it

724
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:02,390
just can't catch a break

725
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:04,400
but I think what's more interesting than

726
00:33:02,390 --> 00:33:06,710
evaluating all of these different

727
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:08,900
insects that feed is the way that the

728
00:33:06,710 --> 00:33:11,150
plant naturally defends itself against

729
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:12,530
all of these insects and there's so many

730
00:33:11,150 --> 00:33:14,019
different ways and today I'm going to

731
00:33:12,529 --> 00:33:18,109
talk with you about one in particular

732
00:33:14,019 --> 00:33:21,048
the use of volatile organic compounds so

733
00:33:18,109 --> 00:33:23,178
VOCs are not only defensive compounds

734
00:33:21,048 --> 00:33:26,389
but they can be used to attract

735
00:33:23,179 --> 00:33:28,820
pollinators like bees but if they are

736
00:33:26,390 --> 00:33:32,090
used in defense they're used indirectly

737
00:33:28,819 --> 00:33:34,129
or directly indirectly is when it

738
00:33:32,089 --> 00:33:37,099
attracts natural enemies of herbivores

739
00:33:34,130 --> 00:33:39,530
like parasitic wasps and directly is

740
00:33:37,099 --> 00:33:42,048
when it deters things like caterpillars

741
00:33:39,529 --> 00:33:46,700
and infants from actually feeding on the

742
00:33:42,048 --> 00:33:48,558
plant and so I mentioned this enzyme to

743
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:51,140
PSU and you're probably wondering what

744
00:33:48,558 --> 00:33:53,119
does this have to do with VOCs um so T

745
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:55,970
vs juice and enzyme O's found by a

746
00:33:53,119 --> 00:33:58,279
previous postdoc in my lab to experience

747
00:33:55,970 --> 00:34:01,100
a significant gene upregulation in

748
00:33:58,279 --> 00:34:03,619
response to a feed feeding and whenever

749
00:34:01,099 --> 00:34:04,908
we see this in an rna-seq analysis we

750
00:34:03,619 --> 00:34:06,399
think okay maybe it's playing a role in

751
00:34:04,909 --> 00:34:08,950
defense

752
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:11,079
further elucidation of this enzyme is

753
00:34:08,949 --> 00:34:13,839
found that the primary products are a

754
00:34:11,079 --> 00:34:17,529
little they're a little journal in alone

755
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:19,870
which are all VOCs so I became really

756
00:34:17,530 --> 00:34:22,620
interested in this because the natural

757
00:34:19,869 --> 00:34:24,940
next question is let's see if these

758
00:34:22,619 --> 00:34:27,759
compounds are playing a direct role in

759
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:28,480
defense and if you can touch test each

760
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,800
one of them

761
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:31,119
maybe there's a specific one in

762
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:35,590
particular that a peds are being

763
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:37,628
attracted to or deter and this is just a

764
00:34:35,590 --> 00:34:40,780
GC analysis that was conducted by the

765
00:34:37,628 --> 00:34:42,579
post office on GPS tube and this is

766
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:45,030
showing that the wild-type line that we

767
00:34:42,579 --> 00:34:48,279
have which is a DES knockout line um

768
00:34:45,030 --> 00:34:51,909
does not have the same volatile Peaks

769
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:55,540
for literal d MN t TM TT and their

770
00:34:51,909 --> 00:34:56,950
little as the wild-type w22

771
00:34:55,539 --> 00:35:01,119
which is amazing bread line that was

772
00:34:56,949 --> 00:35:03,069
used to make this not go and so I had a

773
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:05,799
variety of different methods for trying

774
00:35:03,070 --> 00:35:07,900
to answer this question what is TPS -

775
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:09,820
doing a defense and could went a little

776
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:12,340
narrow little and Jeremy Lin will all be

777
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:14,830
involved in this event the first was a

778
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:17,500
choice assay and this assay was meant to

779
00:35:14,829 --> 00:35:19,750
see if a phase or exhibiting a general

780
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:23,710
preference towards the TPS - knockout

781
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:25,360
line or not the second was all full

782
00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:28,030
factory assays which appeals to the

783
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:30,610
aphid sense of smell and this was meant

784
00:35:28,030 --> 00:35:33,130
to determine if little ol mer little or

785
00:35:30,610 --> 00:35:36,130
Gary Nolan Elul were directly causing

786
00:35:33,130 --> 00:35:38,590
some sort of defense or attraction in

787
00:35:36,130 --> 00:35:41,410
the final which was my favorite was on

788
00:35:38,590 --> 00:35:43,210
electrical penetration grab a C and this

789
00:35:41,409 --> 00:35:45,789
was meant to see if a good feeding

790
00:35:43,210 --> 00:35:48,550
duration pattern and frequency were

791
00:35:45,789 --> 00:35:50,699
altered in response to these volatile

792
00:35:48,550 --> 00:35:54,640
compounds that are present in tickets

793
00:35:50,699 --> 00:35:57,730
and so the choice assay the pretty

794
00:35:54,639 --> 00:35:59,679
self-explanatory I planted w22 plant

795
00:35:57,730 --> 00:36:02,590
next to the knockout line that we have

796
00:35:59,679 --> 00:36:04,899
and I put about 20 agents in the center

797
00:36:02,590 --> 00:36:05,500
of the plant a caged it and timed it for

798
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:08,410
20 hours

799
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:11,199
um and then I counted where the aphids

800
00:36:08,409 --> 00:36:13,989
choose to go if it was on that w22 or

801
00:36:11,199 --> 00:36:16,108
the TPS - and the reason I chose 20

802
00:36:13,989 --> 00:36:18,479
hours is because a graph that I have

803
00:36:16,108 --> 00:36:19,659
later that I can show you if you want

804
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:22,630
show

805
00:36:19,659 --> 00:36:25,269
that the gene expression of TPS to its

806
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:27,309
highest between 18 and 24 hours so it

807
00:36:25,269 --> 00:36:31,989
makes sense to evaluate the offense

808
00:36:27,309 --> 00:36:36,010
within a and the results for this were

809
00:36:31,989 --> 00:36:38,798
pretty surprising I guess um for the

810
00:36:36,010 --> 00:36:41,140
knockout line we see that Athens weren't

811
00:36:38,798 --> 00:36:44,108
actually got into it compared to the

812
00:36:41,139 --> 00:36:46,568
wild type line w22 and I talked about

813
00:36:44,108 --> 00:36:48,759
volatiles before is potentially acting

814
00:36:46,568 --> 00:36:51,159
as direct or indirect defense mechanisms

815
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:53,109
but what we're seeing here is the

816
00:36:51,159 --> 00:36:54,879
volatiles that are present in the wild

817
00:36:53,108 --> 00:36:57,130
type line and not in the knockout are

818
00:36:54,880 --> 00:37:00,608
actually encouraging the agents to come

819
00:36:57,130 --> 00:37:02,920
to the wild type so after getting these

820
00:37:00,608 --> 00:37:05,710
results I thought okay maybe I need to

821
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:08,349
reevaluate my hypothesis and look at

822
00:37:05,710 --> 00:37:11,139
these volatiles little narrow little

823
00:37:08,349 --> 00:37:15,430
journal and law as attractants and not

824
00:37:11,139 --> 00:37:18,009
as defense mechanisms so the next thing

825
00:37:15,429 --> 00:37:20,048
I did was olfactory at they this one was

826
00:37:18,010 --> 00:37:20,440
kind of fun I got to watch 8 bits move

827
00:37:20,048 --> 00:37:22,829
around

828
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:24,789
the glass tube for three minutes

829
00:37:22,829 --> 00:37:26,859
essentially what I did is I put them in

830
00:37:24,789 --> 00:37:31,020
the center and then I introduced the

831
00:37:26,858 --> 00:37:34,358
volatile here and track their movement a

832
00:37:31,019 --> 00:37:36,400
very crude setup and in the future this

833
00:37:34,358 --> 00:37:38,440
will probably be repeated with a y tube

834
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:41,588
which controls for pressure and air flow

835
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:43,389
to prevent any other volatiles from

836
00:37:41,588 --> 00:37:44,619
being in the system and to also control

837
00:37:43,389 --> 00:37:48,639
the amount they're actually being

838
00:37:44,619 --> 00:37:50,769
exposed to and the results for this

839
00:37:48,639 --> 00:37:53,920
we're also quite interesting so we see

840
00:37:50,769 --> 00:37:56,409
general little ole here um they're

841
00:37:53,920 --> 00:38:00,909
little and little all show general

842
00:37:56,409 --> 00:38:03,670
movement towards however I based on this

843
00:38:00,909 --> 00:38:06,239
data that I collected and data that I've

844
00:38:03,670 --> 00:38:09,039
collected previously using our Midas I

845
00:38:06,239 --> 00:38:10,959
would deem general Manila as a potential

846
00:38:09,039 --> 00:38:13,480
attractant because although this isn't

847
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:15,278
statistically significant I've done many

848
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:18,099
more replicates of this experiment and

849
00:38:15,278 --> 00:38:21,088
we do see a fifth migrating far more

850
00:38:18,099 --> 00:38:24,579
towards during a little oil then away

851
00:38:21,088 --> 00:38:27,608
the next guy is Nair a little and I

852
00:38:24,579 --> 00:38:31,059
would deem this a very clear attractant

853
00:38:27,608 --> 00:38:32,969
for the aphids the reason being of all

854
00:38:31,059 --> 00:38:35,880
of these guys that I tested

855
00:38:32,969 --> 00:38:38,519
the amount of aphids that made a choice

856
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:40,650
or didn't just stay put and that you was

857
00:38:38,519 --> 00:38:44,610
the highest form they're a little it is

858
00:38:40,650 --> 00:38:46,230
about 65% and we see a highly

859
00:38:44,610 --> 00:38:48,210
statistically significant movement

860
00:38:46,230 --> 00:38:52,190
towards the volatile rather than away

861
00:38:48,210 --> 00:38:54,900
which makes me think that it's and

862
00:38:52,190 --> 00:38:56,880
little is unconfirmed although this

863
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:58,800
graph looks very promising that the

864
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:01,800
aphids clearly seem to want to move

865
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:03,510
toward the volatile um previous data

866
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:05,370
that I've done with our Midas did not

867
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:06,960
find this at all they actually I'd

868
00:39:05,369 --> 00:39:09,960
actually found that the aphids are

869
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:13,349
moving about as equally toward as a way

870
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:16,050
um and only 10% of the aphids made a

871
00:39:13,349 --> 00:39:18,599
choice in this situation so I don't deem

872
00:39:16,050 --> 00:39:22,470
that enough to say that this could be an

873
00:39:18,599 --> 00:39:24,360
attractive and the final essay that I

874
00:39:22,469 --> 00:39:27,869
did was the electrical penetration graph

875
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:32,340
passing and how this works is you have

876
00:39:27,869 --> 00:39:34,199
an aphid attached to a probe here which

877
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:37,800
is attached to a device that basically

878
00:39:34,199 --> 00:39:39,750
amplifies the different voltage

879
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:42,500
potentials that happen when an aphid

880
00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:45,210
styler is inserted into the leaf and

881
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:47,550
this amplification gets stored in a

882
00:39:45,210 --> 00:39:50,730
computer and I get a nice set of

883
00:39:47,550 --> 00:39:52,830
waveforms I can analyze and essentially

884
00:39:50,730 --> 00:39:55,409
what this is doing is creating a massive

885
00:39:52,829 --> 00:39:57,690
circuit so we're tracking the difference

886
00:39:55,409 --> 00:40:02,190
in voltage potential and determining

887
00:39:57,690 --> 00:40:04,139
where in the plant and I just want to

888
00:40:02,190 --> 00:40:06,869
show you what I actually have to do for

889
00:40:04,139 --> 00:40:09,449
this happen um this is a feed here and

890
00:40:06,869 --> 00:40:11,400
it is attached with silver glue to a

891
00:40:09,449 --> 00:40:14,339
gold wire that's probably as thin as a

892
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:16,410
hair and this wire the touch with silver

893
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:19,620
glucose copper wire which is then

894
00:40:16,409 --> 00:40:23,099
soldered to a brass insect pin and this

895
00:40:19,619 --> 00:40:25,559
pin then goes into the probe that I

896
00:40:23,099 --> 00:40:27,839
showed before and when the aphid starts

897
00:40:25,559 --> 00:40:30,799
feeding the circuit is complete and you

898
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:30,800
have data that you can analyze

899
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:40,130
experiment in action and this machine

900
00:40:37,670 --> 00:40:44,269
can take up to eight eight plants at

901
00:40:40,130 --> 00:40:46,400
once I did about 30 plants for each line

902
00:40:44,269 --> 00:40:48,860
and it takes a long time to analyze the

903
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:50,690
data so it was a lot of work it's a very

904
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:54,260
cool machine and I definitely my

905
00:40:50,690 --> 00:40:56,030
favorite part about doing this and

906
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:57,650
unfortunately even though all this is

907
00:40:56,030 --> 00:40:59,630
really cool the results weren't actually

908
00:40:57,650 --> 00:41:02,180
that significant for me um

909
00:40:59,630 --> 00:41:04,880
I separated the results into four

910
00:41:02,179 --> 00:41:07,190
different types the first being an

911
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:09,680
assessment of the non probing non

912
00:41:07,190 --> 00:41:12,260
probing behavior of the aphid meaning

913
00:41:09,679 --> 00:41:14,629
when it's not feeding um the second

914
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:16,850
being a pathway phase behavior which is

915
00:41:14,630 --> 00:41:20,210
basically preparation for feeding or

916
00:41:16,849 --> 00:41:22,309
salivation the third being xylem phase

917
00:41:20,210 --> 00:41:24,289
feeding or just inserting the silent to

918
00:41:22,309 --> 00:41:25,789
the xylem and the fourth which is what

919
00:41:24,289 --> 00:41:27,889
we really care about is the flow and

920
00:41:25,789 --> 00:41:31,400
feeding which is when the aphid is

921
00:41:27,889 --> 00:41:32,989
actually ingesting plone and as you can

922
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:35,720
see if we're non coping and pathway

923
00:41:32,989 --> 00:41:37,369
phase behavior um these results are not

924
00:41:35,719 --> 00:41:39,349
statistically significant they're pretty

925
00:41:37,369 --> 00:41:42,739
similar to one another in terms of the

926
00:41:39,349 --> 00:41:45,409
TPS to knock out in a wild-type and four

927
00:41:42,739 --> 00:41:49,309
xylem and clone face feeding we also see

928
00:41:45,409 --> 00:41:51,139
very similar results and at first I was

929
00:41:49,309 --> 00:41:52,789
a bit discouraged by this but when I

930
00:41:51,139 --> 00:41:55,670
thought about it a little bit more I

931
00:41:52,789 --> 00:41:57,440
think that this could just be indicating

932
00:41:55,670 --> 00:42:00,050
that the TPS you enzyme is not

933
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:02,480
necessarily playing a role in a fig

934
00:42:00,050 --> 00:42:04,910
feeding behavior but more of a role in

935
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:05,780
attracting the aphid to the plant and

936
00:42:04,909 --> 00:42:07,579
once it's there

937
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:11,180
it'll just feed on its own and do

938
00:42:07,579 --> 00:42:14,150
something so the main takeaways of my

939
00:42:11,179 --> 00:42:18,139
project I want to first reintroduce the

940
00:42:14,150 --> 00:42:20,119
goal so the goal was to determine what

941
00:42:18,139 --> 00:42:23,420
role this TPS 2 enzyme is playing in

942
00:42:20,119 --> 00:42:26,690
Mason may say for defense specifically

943
00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:29,269
if the the byproducts of this enzyme

944
00:42:26,690 --> 00:42:31,460
were serving as attractants or deterring

945
00:42:29,269 --> 00:42:34,099
the Athan or something else was going on

946
00:42:31,460 --> 00:42:36,470
and based on the results that I found

947
00:42:34,099 --> 00:42:38,119
you see that Athens do seem to be

948
00:42:36,469 --> 00:42:40,129
favoring the wild-type line which has

949
00:42:38,119 --> 00:42:42,259
the volatiles present over the knockout

950
00:42:40,130 --> 00:42:44,210
which would indicate some sort of

951
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:45,980
attractive mechanism going on

952
00:42:44,210 --> 00:42:48,108
and then when we move forward and look

953
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:49,820
at the actual volatiles we see that

954
00:42:48,108 --> 00:42:52,639
narrow little and general little Oh

955
00:42:49,820 --> 00:42:55,070
could be clear attractant stored the

956
00:42:52,639 --> 00:42:58,759
aphid little ol would have to do more

957
00:42:55,070 --> 00:43:00,410
work to assess that and finally because

958
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:04,250
the EPG results weren't as conclusive

959
00:43:00,409 --> 00:43:07,460
one could determine that the the role of

960
00:43:04,250 --> 00:43:09,170
T PSU is not to encourage feeding

961
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:12,289
behavior but to encourage a third

962
00:43:09,170 --> 00:43:13,820
attraction so I have a lot of people I'd

963
00:43:12,289 --> 00:43:17,389
like to thank first and foremost George

964
00:43:13,820 --> 00:43:18,800
gender my PA and my postdoc in at

965
00:43:17,389 --> 00:43:20,659
Richter for helping me throughout this

966
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:23,839
whole project I've been in this lab for

967
00:43:20,659 --> 00:43:25,879
four years now so it's a long time I'd

968
00:43:23,838 --> 00:43:27,650
also like to thank the ASP B education

969
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:30,289
and outreach team for giving me the

970
00:43:27,650 --> 00:43:32,119
opportunity to present this preliminary

971
00:43:30,289 --> 00:43:34,849
data for this research last year and

972
00:43:32,119 --> 00:43:36,588
fund this project and the hunter ruins

973
00:43:34,849 --> 00:43:38,059
the third presidential research scholars

974
00:43:36,588 --> 00:43:55,900
for funding my research throughout my

975
00:43:38,059 --> 00:43:58,820
time that was a great talk thank you so

976
00:43:55,900 --> 00:44:02,660
I'm a corn breeder so my question of

977
00:43:58,820 --> 00:44:04,940
course is if you shut this TPS two down

978
00:44:02,659 --> 00:44:06,319
what are the downsides for the plant you

979
00:44:04,940 --> 00:44:08,329
haven't I know that wasn't part of your

980
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:10,309
research but what other things besides

981
00:44:08,329 --> 00:44:14,630
maybe attracting agents could it be

982
00:44:10,309 --> 00:44:17,960
doing for the corn plant I think the

983
00:44:14,630 --> 00:44:20,450
main issue that could arise is when you

984
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:23,420
shut down this enzyme other terpenes

985
00:44:20,449 --> 00:44:26,269
could be created from the substrates of

986
00:44:23,420 --> 00:44:28,099
the enzyme and unfortunately the scope

987
00:44:26,269 --> 00:44:30,259
of my project did not research those

988
00:44:28,099 --> 00:44:32,450
terpenes but that was my secondary

989
00:44:30,260 --> 00:44:34,940
hypothesis is that those terpenes could

990
00:44:32,449 --> 00:44:37,368
actually be influencing the attraction

991
00:44:34,940 --> 00:44:40,159
or detection of the aphids so you either

992
00:44:37,369 --> 00:44:41,960
could see maybe a difference in a third

993
00:44:40,159 --> 00:44:46,420
behavior but what you would more likely

994
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:46,420
see is a different implant behavior

995
00:44:48,010 --> 00:44:51,189
[Applause]

996
00:44:55,039 --> 00:45:01,259
all right I think already next we have

997
00:44:58,619 --> 00:45:03,420
Samantha Hackett and she will be talking

998
00:45:01,260 --> 00:45:05,790
about lead and arsenic uptake by

999
00:45:03,420 --> 00:45:10,230
radishes in contaminated orchard soil

1000
00:45:05,789 --> 00:45:15,599
Sam thank you so we're talking about a

1001
00:45:10,230 --> 00:45:17,070
minute land okay so how did the soil get

1002
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:18,420
contaminated that's a really great

1003
00:45:17,070 --> 00:45:21,059
question

1004
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:24,809
so there are sides are used for orchard

1005
00:45:21,059 --> 00:45:26,639
soils and that was a common practice for

1006
00:45:24,809 --> 00:45:28,349
these pesticides fees from about like

1007
00:45:26,639 --> 00:45:32,909
the 1920s and 1950s

1008
00:45:28,349 --> 00:45:35,069
and so this land was passed orchard soil

1009
00:45:32,909 --> 00:45:36,960
and it's still prevalent it's still

1010
00:45:35,070 --> 00:45:38,730
there it's not going anywhere because

1011
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:39,990
it's rather immobile I'm just a good

1012
00:45:38,730 --> 00:45:42,119
thing a bad thing you know doesn't gonna

1013
00:45:39,989 --> 00:45:46,229
turn water sources but can't really

1014
00:45:42,119 --> 00:45:47,519
harmless with much freedom and with that

1015
00:45:46,230 --> 00:45:49,440
like there's other areas that are

1016
00:45:47,519 --> 00:45:51,449
impacted not just old orchard soils

1017
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:53,429
there was Letty gasoline that was very

1018
00:45:51,449 --> 00:45:55,769
common and it's still prevalent

1019
00:45:53,429 --> 00:45:59,129
throughout the world but so like urban

1020
00:45:55,769 --> 00:46:01,349
soils are always a concern also and this

1021
00:45:59,130 --> 00:46:03,300
is a picture of some land that is

1022
00:46:01,349 --> 00:46:05,909
contaminated Carrie tell because it's

1023
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:07,530
just a bunch of soil but continuing so

1024
00:46:05,909 --> 00:46:11,989
health effects why do we even care about

1025
00:46:07,530 --> 00:46:15,330
these lovely toxic metals so arsenic is

1026
00:46:11,989 --> 00:46:17,969
very critical when it deals with the

1027
00:46:15,329 --> 00:46:20,699
nervous system and cardiovascular system

1028
00:46:17,969 --> 00:46:23,129
will cause those fail and then also with

1029
00:46:20,699 --> 00:46:25,230
lead those will that will cause

1030
00:46:23,130 --> 00:46:27,420
developmental behavioral problems

1031
00:46:25,230 --> 00:46:29,789
especially in children and then also

1032
00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:32,639
affect your cognitive cognitive function

1033
00:46:29,789 --> 00:46:36,059
and then eventually lead to death okay

1034
00:46:32,639 --> 00:46:39,239
so um cellular uptake of arsenic so

1035
00:46:36,059 --> 00:46:41,159
arsenic is a physiological of toxic

1036
00:46:39,239 --> 00:46:44,879
metal and so it's gonna be taken up

1037
00:46:41,159 --> 00:46:47,989
through the plant so arsenic 5 it looks

1038
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:51,570
really similar to phosphate and then

1039
00:46:47,989 --> 00:46:55,049
arsenic 5 can turn into arsenic 3 in

1040
00:46:51,570 --> 00:46:57,390
anaerobic soils arsenic 5 is also then

1041
00:46:55,050 --> 00:47:01,370
going to be tightly bound to these soil

1042
00:46:57,389 --> 00:47:04,019
particles so leaving it in mobile soil

1043
00:47:01,369 --> 00:47:06,179
so because it looks so similar capacity

1044
00:47:04,019 --> 00:47:08,369
it's going to be taken up through the

1045
00:47:06,179 --> 00:47:10,528
cell by Fossey

1046
00:47:08,369 --> 00:47:13,200
order there and then it's also going to

1047
00:47:10,528 --> 00:47:16,259
do that in transitioned to arsenic three

1048
00:47:13,199 --> 00:47:18,268
by a reductase and then from here it's

1049
00:47:16,259 --> 00:47:21,389
going to either restore it in a vacuole

1050
00:47:18,268 --> 00:47:23,308
or it's going to go into the xylem and

1051
00:47:21,389 --> 00:47:25,650
just go through multiple other cells

1052
00:47:23,309 --> 00:47:28,740
basically repeat this whole process will

1053
00:47:25,650 --> 00:47:31,139
run over our hope is that then some

1054
00:47:28,739 --> 00:47:33,868
plants will store more arsenic in its

1055
00:47:31,139 --> 00:47:38,190
vacuoles versus having it yeah taken up

1056
00:47:33,869 --> 00:47:40,740
through plants higher places so some

1057
00:47:38,190 --> 00:47:43,200
other ways that it's taking off can vary

1058
00:47:40,739 --> 00:47:47,248
from plants plants so like rice is going

1059
00:47:43,199 --> 00:47:49,139
to have a si si channel and then it

1060
00:47:47,248 --> 00:47:53,548
varies as you go through different

1061
00:47:49,139 --> 00:47:55,858
plants so let it's a particular

1062
00:47:53,548 --> 00:47:57,989
contaminant and that means that it

1063
00:47:55,858 --> 00:48:00,088
basically the physical particles if it's

1064
00:47:57,989 --> 00:48:01,348
on those leaves or on that piece of

1065
00:48:00,088 --> 00:48:03,929
vegetable that you're trying to eat

1066
00:48:01,349 --> 00:48:07,079
that's how you would get led ingest it

1067
00:48:03,929 --> 00:48:08,639
and that's a concern because we're

1068
00:48:07,079 --> 00:48:10,980
growing radishes radishes are in direct

1069
00:48:08,639 --> 00:48:13,768
contact with soil and that's also

1070
00:48:10,980 --> 00:48:16,920
concerned like lettuce and much other

1071
00:48:13,768 --> 00:48:18,719
vegetables some other concerns that we

1072
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:21,420
have are where is it actually in the

1073
00:48:18,719 --> 00:48:24,028
soil profile is it going to be in the

1074
00:48:21,420 --> 00:48:25,798
upper layer or lower layer in this case

1075
00:48:24,028 --> 00:48:29,130
because we're working with pesticides it

1076
00:48:25,798 --> 00:48:32,159
is in the upper layer and then also the

1077
00:48:29,130 --> 00:48:34,980
contact exposure so do you have

1078
00:48:32,159 --> 00:48:37,889
something over that surface of freshly

1079
00:48:34,980 --> 00:48:39,960
tilled soil and such and then also a

1080
00:48:37,889 --> 00:48:43,558
plan Anatomy you know are we harvesting

1081
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:45,298
the like corn that's under the husk or

1082
00:48:43,559 --> 00:48:46,798
are we harvesting the radish wheat

1083
00:48:45,298 --> 00:48:52,199
that's right in contact with the soil

1084
00:48:46,798 --> 00:48:55,998
and then soil pH also does vary so with

1085
00:48:52,199 --> 00:48:59,759
my particular research I had 12 pots

1086
00:48:55,998 --> 00:49:01,949
they're all contaminated soil and the

1087
00:48:59,759 --> 00:49:03,960
only difference was that half were

1088
00:49:01,949 --> 00:49:08,489
fertilized with composted chicken manure

1089
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:10,849
and the other half were just plain and

1090
00:49:08,489 --> 00:49:15,329
then plant it radishes and all of them

1091
00:49:10,849 --> 00:49:17,269
so results um I kind of just highlighted

1092
00:49:15,329 --> 00:49:21,240
the things that we're either trending or

1093
00:49:17,268 --> 00:49:25,109
significant and based on Europe and

1094
00:49:21,239 --> 00:49:28,979
Asia's standards for lead arsenic they

1095
00:49:25,110 --> 00:49:32,640
have one PPI ppm excuse me for lead and

1096
00:49:28,980 --> 00:49:35,039
then also 5 ppm for arsenic and that's

1097
00:49:32,639 --> 00:49:36,629
for dry weights a vegetable or produce

1098
00:49:35,039 --> 00:49:39,300
that you would be consuming and that's

1099
00:49:36,630 --> 00:49:44,010
the considered like safe value we are

1100
00:49:39,300 --> 00:49:45,840
over that hippie um and so the first

1101
00:49:44,010 --> 00:49:48,930
thing arsenic is what we're kind of

1102
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:52,050
hoping for the fertilizer to compete

1103
00:49:48,929 --> 00:49:55,019
with Aussie and that's showing a trend

1104
00:49:52,050 --> 00:49:56,880
but not yet snick significant so it's

1105
00:49:55,019 --> 00:49:58,289
hoping that if I fertilize it more than

1106
00:49:56,880 --> 00:50:03,240
there'd be more competition with that

1107
00:49:58,289 --> 00:50:06,269
uptake and then from lead with leaves in

1108
00:50:03,239 --> 00:50:09,000
the second harvest between fertilize and

1109
00:50:06,269 --> 00:50:11,460
not fertilize that was a significant

1110
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:13,110
another one was with the roots um so

1111
00:50:11,460 --> 00:50:18,059
that's in there at contact and that's

1112
00:50:13,110 --> 00:50:20,099
good that is showing a difference so

1113
00:50:18,059 --> 00:50:22,860
since they're lettuce and particulate

1114
00:50:20,099 --> 00:50:25,469
contaminate we wanted to show that

1115
00:50:22,860 --> 00:50:28,590
difference between when an arsenic so I

1116
00:50:25,469 --> 00:50:33,179
did a correlation and this is people

1117
00:50:28,590 --> 00:50:35,430
looking at LED and aluminum and beans

1118
00:50:33,179 --> 00:50:37,079
and then this is looking at the roots I

1119
00:50:35,429 --> 00:50:38,879
didn't show the arsenic because there

1120
00:50:37,079 --> 00:50:40,969
wasn't a correlation but you can see

1121
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:44,220
here with this trend line there is a

1122
00:50:40,969 --> 00:50:47,608
correlation with that I'm so just going

1123
00:50:44,219 --> 00:50:52,459
forward on that's consistent with other

1124
00:50:47,608 --> 00:50:55,319
research the options for remediation um

1125
00:50:52,460 --> 00:50:56,699
we chose the compost and fertilizer so

1126
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:59,280
kind of just hidden those two bullets

1127
00:50:56,699 --> 00:51:01,409
there but you can fuse item or there's a

1128
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:04,109
lot of different options for research

1129
00:51:01,409 --> 00:51:06,868
and experimentation and also looking at

1130
00:51:04,108 --> 00:51:09,389
other production of life stages but

1131
00:51:06,869 --> 00:51:11,430
we're hoping to do was analyze exceeds

1132
00:51:09,389 --> 00:51:13,440
unfortunately I should take a while to

1133
00:51:11,429 --> 00:51:16,589
see so that's what we're doing right now

1134
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:19,260
but um so instead of like growing

1135
00:51:16,590 --> 00:51:20,970
radishes and hoping to eat the actual

1136
00:51:19,260 --> 00:51:23,250
radishes you could just produce the

1137
00:51:20,969 --> 00:51:26,449
seeds and some seeds those are all

1138
00:51:23,250 --> 00:51:29,358
options and to try to fight going around

1139
00:51:26,449 --> 00:51:31,939
that contamination

1140
00:51:29,358 --> 00:51:35,019
some acknowledgments that I wanted to

1141
00:51:31,940 --> 00:51:37,659
say some running with Brian my professor

1142
00:51:35,019 --> 00:51:40,119
and supervising me he's spent a lot of

1143
00:51:37,659 --> 00:51:41,920
time also like gathered the soil and

1144
00:51:40,119 --> 00:51:44,019
doing a lot stuff so that was Austin to

1145
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:47,920
get first-hand knowledge for him and

1146
00:51:44,019 --> 00:51:51,099
then Hana was the push-off in Assam and

1147
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:52,750
she was super helpful to filming Hill

1148
00:51:51,099 --> 00:51:54,730
unfortunately for their contaminated

1149
00:51:52,750 --> 00:51:56,800
soil and then also the greenhouse staff

1150
00:51:54,730 --> 00:52:01,150
for being so nice and helping me with

1151
00:51:56,800 --> 00:52:03,789
watering so those are references that

1152
00:52:01,150 --> 00:52:07,130
we're from my own pictures and such

1153
00:52:03,789 --> 00:52:13,779
thank you happy to take any questions

1154
00:52:07,130 --> 00:52:13,780
[Applause]

1155
00:52:13,860 --> 00:52:21,280
anyone investigated uptake from things

1156
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:23,230
like lead-based paints because that

1157
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:25,300
occurs around houses and people have

1158
00:52:23,230 --> 00:52:28,920
garden there and so forth so is it visit

1159
00:52:25,300 --> 00:52:33,190
go into the plants that way yeah so um

1160
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:34,809
with lead specifically based that is a

1161
00:52:33,190 --> 00:52:37,000
concern obviously because I'm most

1162
00:52:34,809 --> 00:52:38,949
affecting so many urban soils and then

1163
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:41,949
also like suburban soils and such

1164
00:52:38,949 --> 00:52:44,109
because those are so like a large fleet

1165
00:52:41,949 --> 00:52:46,949
the concern is really when they start

1166
00:52:44,110 --> 00:52:50,320
getting really small and broken up and

1167
00:52:46,949 --> 00:52:52,539
the concern is then is that going to be

1168
00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:54,370
directly on chi or whatever you're

1169
00:52:52,539 --> 00:52:56,559
eating or if the child is eating it or

1170
00:52:54,369 --> 00:53:00,029
whoever's eating it you know so that can

1171
00:52:56,559 --> 00:53:03,730
be amended with like washing regimens or

1172
00:53:00,030 --> 00:53:05,050
removing that top layer of soil we're

1173
00:53:03,730 --> 00:53:07,630
just removing those chips of paint

1174
00:53:05,050 --> 00:53:10,030
there's plenty of research on it because

1175
00:53:07,630 --> 00:53:13,470
there was such a scare and so many

1176
00:53:10,030 --> 00:53:14,680
people got um basically sick from it

1177
00:53:13,469 --> 00:53:16,359
yeah

1178
00:53:14,679 --> 00:53:17,919
there's a ton of research on it and like

1179
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:22,470
now they're looking at specifically what

1180
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:27,809
plants and crops are safe to grow with

1181
00:53:22,469 --> 00:53:27,809
thank you the questions

1182
00:53:31,719 --> 00:53:36,319
hi so I know that you talked about more

1183
00:53:34,250 --> 00:53:38,119
of the soil effects on the uptake but I

1184
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:40,430
was curious on if we know anything about

1185
00:53:38,119 --> 00:53:42,769
whether or not the plant has control

1186
00:53:40,429 --> 00:53:45,230
once it's in the cell on whether or not

1187
00:53:42,769 --> 00:53:47,269
you can like store it in vacuole rather

1188
00:53:45,230 --> 00:53:49,490
than going back to like the harvested

1189
00:53:47,269 --> 00:53:51,710
parts of the plants yeah definitely

1190
00:53:49,489 --> 00:53:53,899
so that's gonna vary plant to plant or

1191
00:53:51,710 --> 00:53:55,610
species to species really the plants

1192
00:53:53,900 --> 00:53:57,920
don't want it in them it's typically

1193
00:53:55,610 --> 00:53:59,480
toxic there are some plants that will

1194
00:53:57,920 --> 00:54:02,360
just take up an abundant amount and

1195
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:04,250
that's not really those are kind of not

1196
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:06,260
considered excluders you know they are

1197
00:54:04,250 --> 00:54:08,960
they're the ones that people usually use

1198
00:54:06,260 --> 00:54:11,660
to try to remove the text metals from

1199
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:14,269
the soil but besides that so it's very

1200
00:54:11,659 --> 00:54:16,460
common for the plants to stop it at the

1201
00:54:14,269 --> 00:54:18,349
flowering and seeding or flowering and

1202
00:54:16,460 --> 00:54:20,389
fruiting phase because that's their

1203
00:54:18,349 --> 00:54:23,779
offspring and they don't want any other

1204
00:54:20,389 --> 00:54:27,259
toxic things to go into that and it's

1205
00:54:23,780 --> 00:54:29,630
common for that uptake to basically halt

1206
00:54:27,260 --> 00:54:32,210
at that point and that's where like

1207
00:54:29,630 --> 00:54:34,940
growing corn or beans and stuff like

1208
00:54:32,210 --> 00:54:36,320
that is better or like seen as more of

1209
00:54:34,940 --> 00:54:38,240
the solution and that's why I like

1210
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:40,190
permaculture is a very common thing in

1211
00:54:38,239 --> 00:54:41,599
those soil isn't like why it worked is

1212
00:54:40,190 --> 00:54:48,619
there still a look and grow on those

1213
00:54:41,599 --> 00:54:52,159
lands thank you hello so in your results

1214
00:54:48,619 --> 00:54:54,859
there was like a 23 something but it was

1215
00:54:52,159 --> 00:54:58,519
plus or minus 17 I wanted to like ask

1216
00:54:54,860 --> 00:55:01,789
you how you explain that okay so those

1217
00:54:58,519 --> 00:55:03,980
are basically the averages of all my

1218
00:55:01,789 --> 00:55:05,449
results and then the plus and minus was

1219
00:55:03,980 --> 00:55:07,119
the standard deviation does that answer

1220
00:55:05,449 --> 00:55:09,859
your question

1221
00:55:07,119 --> 00:55:13,279
why was it so variable this question why

1222
00:55:09,860 --> 00:55:15,220
is it so variable um I mean I think I'd

1223
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:19,670
have to look at it specifically but uh

1224
00:55:15,219 --> 00:55:23,539
there is a plus or minus 17 I guess

1225
00:55:19,670 --> 00:55:25,010
because out of those six I had a number

1226
00:55:23,539 --> 00:55:27,139
of radishes like harvest see it wasn't

1227
00:55:25,010 --> 00:55:29,660
just like one from each pot but it was

1228
00:55:27,139 --> 00:55:32,059
like six or seven from each pot and then

1229
00:55:29,659 --> 00:55:36,889
tried to reach that wheat goal and that

1230
00:55:32,059 --> 00:55:38,630
was necessary for the test and that was

1231
00:55:36,889 --> 00:55:40,579
kind of I guess I need to look at the

1232
00:55:38,630 --> 00:55:43,119
specific number I'm sorry but yeah does

1233
00:55:40,579 --> 00:55:43,119
that answer your question

1234
00:55:48,559 --> 00:55:56,369
Thanks

1235
00:55:49,900 --> 00:55:56,369
[Applause]

1236
00:56:01,789 --> 00:56:09,829
alright next we have Alison comer

1237
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:13,400
Alison's the title of Alison's talk is

1238
00:56:09,829 --> 00:56:15,318
diseases in forage intercropping systems

1239
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:19,619
ready

1240
00:56:15,318 --> 00:56:21,900
Alison alright thank you so I'm a

1241
00:56:19,619 --> 00:56:25,588
December 2018 graduate so this project

1242
00:56:21,900 --> 00:56:27,660
is ongoing and I'm working on the data

1243
00:56:25,588 --> 00:56:29,429
collection pretty much starting next

1244
00:56:27,659 --> 00:56:30,750
week so my presentation is gonna be a

1245
00:56:29,429 --> 00:56:33,750
little bit of different format than

1246
00:56:30,750 --> 00:56:35,400
everyone else's so I'm gonna start with

1247
00:56:33,750 --> 00:56:38,130
an overview of the problem that my

1248
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:40,289
project is meant to address here in New

1249
00:56:38,130 --> 00:56:42,059
York we have a very large dairy industry

1250
00:56:40,289 --> 00:56:45,929
an organic dairy production is growing

1251
00:56:42,059 --> 00:56:48,450
in order to support dairy cows we use

1252
00:56:45,929 --> 00:56:50,219
forages as animal feed so by extension a

1253
00:56:48,449 --> 00:56:53,250
lot of forage crops are grown in New

1254
00:56:50,219 --> 00:56:54,929
York forage production is becoming

1255
00:56:53,250 --> 00:56:56,849
increasingly more important as organic

1256
00:56:54,929 --> 00:56:58,469
production spreads because there are

1257
00:56:56,849 --> 00:57:00,359
certain requirements organic producers

1258
00:56:58,469 --> 00:57:04,139
to use a certain amount of fresh feed

1259
00:57:00,358 --> 00:57:07,019
that has to come from forages which it's

1260
00:57:04,139 --> 00:57:09,629
easier to grow them locally so forage

1261
00:57:07,019 --> 00:57:10,920
production continues to expand but it is

1262
00:57:09,630 --> 00:57:13,309
being threatened by extreme weather

1263
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:16,440
events in our area so as you can see

1264
00:57:13,309 --> 00:57:19,470
from this graph graph on the right we've

1265
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:21,298
had a 71 percent increase in extreme

1266
00:57:19,469 --> 00:57:26,179
weather events or very heavy

1267
00:57:21,298 --> 00:57:29,699
precipitation in the Northeast since in

1268
00:57:26,179 --> 00:57:31,949
2014 so these weather events have caused

1269
00:57:29,699 --> 00:57:34,348
a lot of damage to forage production in

1270
00:57:31,949 --> 00:57:36,419
our region and intercropping has been

1271
00:57:34,349 --> 00:57:38,068
proposed as a mechanism to buffer for

1272
00:57:36,420 --> 00:57:42,809
introduction from these extreme weather

1273
00:57:38,068 --> 00:57:44,789
events so intercropping is part of a

1274
00:57:42,809 --> 00:57:46,829
bigger scheme called system resilience

1275
00:57:44,789 --> 00:57:48,779
so this is increasing the system's

1276
00:57:46,829 --> 00:57:50,910
tolerance to extreme weather events and

1277
00:57:48,780 --> 00:57:52,798
different environmental conditions so

1278
00:57:50,909 --> 00:57:55,949
intercropping falls into the absorptive

1279
00:57:52,798 --> 00:57:59,338
capacity so this is increasing tolerance

1280
00:57:55,949 --> 00:58:00,989
of the system by using diversifying your

1281
00:57:59,338 --> 00:58:02,849
crop and essentially not putting all

1282
00:58:00,989 --> 00:58:04,199
your eggs in one basket there's also

1283
00:58:02,849 --> 00:58:05,700
other ways to make your system more

1284
00:58:04,199 --> 00:58:08,250
resilience one is the adaptive capacity

1285
00:58:05,699 --> 00:58:09,568
so opening up your cropping system to

1286
00:58:08,250 --> 00:58:11,670
more management strategies such as

1287
00:58:09,568 --> 00:58:14,159
introducing tidal drainage or irrigation

1288
00:58:11,670 --> 00:58:15,840
to cope with weather events that are

1289
00:58:14,159 --> 00:58:18,000
sort of new to the area that you're

1290
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:20,940
starting to see more of in your area and

1291
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:22,710
there's also the restorative capacity so

1292
00:58:20,940 --> 00:58:24,240
this involves recovering from a crop

1293
00:58:22,710 --> 00:58:25,289
failure with external support so that's

1294
00:58:24,239 --> 00:58:28,679
going to be things such as crop

1295
00:58:25,289 --> 00:58:30,539
insurance so a closer look at

1296
00:58:28,679 --> 00:58:32,399
intercropping intercropping is the

1297
00:58:30,539 --> 00:58:34,829
practice of sowing multiple crops in the

1298
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:36,539
same field at the same time so here you

1299
00:58:34,829 --> 00:58:39,239
can see a strip in your cropping system

1300
00:58:36,539 --> 00:58:41,779
where you have maize soybean and OH

1301
00:58:39,239 --> 00:58:45,569
that are all grown in alternating strips

1302
00:58:41,780 --> 00:58:47,370
so essentially the idea with this in

1303
00:58:45,570 --> 00:58:49,500
terms of system resilience is that if

1304
00:58:47,369 --> 00:58:50,909
you have a really tough year for soybean

1305
00:58:49,500 --> 00:58:52,409
so you have a lot of one passed or the

1306
00:58:50,909 --> 00:58:54,629
weather is not great and you see a

1307
00:58:52,409 --> 00:58:58,019
failure of your soybean crop two-thirds

1308
00:58:54,630 --> 00:58:59,340
of your field is not soybean and so you

1309
00:58:58,019 --> 00:59:01,889
don't have complete failure because you

1310
00:58:59,340 --> 00:59:04,980
can rely on your maize and oat crop to

1311
00:59:01,889 --> 00:59:06,480
support you so there are several

1312
00:59:04,980 --> 00:59:08,070
different types of intercropping the one

1313
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:09,570
I just showed is strip which you can see

1314
00:59:08,070 --> 00:59:11,519
here on the right there's more

1315
00:59:09,570 --> 00:59:13,920
alternating type such as row strip and

1316
00:59:11,519 --> 00:59:17,099
row which you'll see in a push-pull

1317
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:19,470
system the system of intercropping that

1318
00:59:17,099 --> 00:59:22,529
this project uses is mixed so all the

1319
00:59:19,469 --> 00:59:23,699
seeds are essentially put together at

1320
00:59:22,530 --> 00:59:27,840
the beginning and then planted out

1321
00:59:23,699 --> 00:59:30,059
randomly so the objective of my study is

1322
00:59:27,840 --> 00:59:32,039
to determine the prevalence of pathogens

1323
00:59:30,059 --> 00:59:33,329
in these diverse organic forage systems

1324
00:59:32,039 --> 00:59:35,369
that also include the use of

1325
00:59:33,329 --> 00:59:37,259
intercropping so some of the smaller

1326
00:59:35,369 --> 00:59:38,339
questions that I'm looking at is are we

1327
00:59:37,260 --> 00:59:39,750
seeing a difference in disease pressure

1328
00:59:38,340 --> 00:59:41,789
when we have an annual inter cropping

1329
00:59:39,750 --> 00:59:43,739
system versus a perennial perennial

1330
00:59:41,789 --> 00:59:45,029
intercropping system are we seeing a

1331
00:59:43,739 --> 00:59:47,099
difference in disease pressure when we

1332
00:59:45,030 --> 00:59:48,690
have multiple susceptible species

1333
00:59:47,099 --> 00:59:51,659
present versus one susceptible species

1334
00:59:48,690 --> 00:59:52,860
to a disease and are we seeing my

1335
00:59:51,659 --> 00:59:56,279
difference in disease pressure when we

1336
00:59:52,860 --> 00:59:57,660
have a plot with one cultivar or a pot

1337
00:59:56,280 --> 00:59:59,850
with both of ours that have varying

1338
00:59:57,659 --> 01:00:01,170
resistance so some might have high

1339
00:59:59,849 --> 01:00:05,969
resistance in the pathogen and others

1340
01:00:01,170 --> 01:00:09,420
might be very susceptible so this year

1341
01:00:05,969 --> 01:00:12,679
we have about 12 crops that are involved

1342
01:00:09,420 --> 01:00:12,680
in this different intercropping

1343
01:00:13,429 --> 01:00:19,319
systems so for the perennial our main

1344
01:00:17,130 --> 01:00:21,420
crop is alfalfa which is involved in all

1345
01:00:19,320 --> 01:00:24,120
four different treatments and for the

1346
01:00:21,420 --> 01:00:25,230
annuals it is triticale so there are

1347
01:00:24,119 --> 01:00:26,489
four different diverse

1348
01:00:25,230 --> 01:00:30,030
Gidi treatments the low diversity

1349
01:00:26,489 --> 01:00:32,429
consists of one species one cultivar the

1350
01:00:30,030 --> 01:00:34,380
conspecific treatment is for Dakar

1351
01:00:32,429 --> 01:00:36,929
cultivars of one species the hetero

1352
01:00:34,380 --> 01:00:39,119
specific treatment is for different

1353
01:00:36,929 --> 01:00:42,059
species one cultivar each and the high

1354
01:00:39,119 --> 01:00:45,769
diversity treatment is for different

1355
01:00:42,059 --> 01:00:45,769
cultivars of four different species so

1356
01:00:46,219 --> 01:00:50,309
this is part of a larger experiment

1357
01:00:48,630 --> 01:00:52,710
called the fire trials which stands for

1358
01:00:50,309 --> 01:00:56,849
forage intercrop resiliency experiment

1359
01:00:52,710 --> 01:00:58,260
so this is a large experiment where they

1360
01:00:56,849 --> 01:01:00,299
use four different diversity levels of

1361
01:00:58,260 --> 01:01:01,890
both annuals and perennials are being

1362
01:01:00,300 --> 01:01:04,260
grown by a Matt Ryan's lab group and

1363
01:01:01,889 --> 01:01:06,239
they're looking at how resilient really

1364
01:01:04,260 --> 01:01:08,609
is the system so measuring things such

1365
01:01:06,239 --> 01:01:12,029
as forage quality and biomass and yield

1366
01:01:08,608 --> 01:01:14,460
and this is an example of what one block

1367
01:01:12,030 --> 01:01:17,010
looks like so there's perennials here

1368
01:01:14,460 --> 01:01:18,389
and annuals and you can see there's the

1369
01:01:17,010 --> 01:01:20,730
four different levels of diversity in

1370
01:01:18,389 --> 01:01:22,769
each and there are five blocks those

1371
01:01:20,730 --> 01:01:24,000
like this each one of the pots is about

1372
01:01:22,769 --> 01:01:26,759
30 by 50 feet

1373
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:28,108
this trial is also big replicated at the

1374
01:01:26,760 --> 01:01:29,730
University of New Hampshire and the

1375
01:01:28,108 --> 01:01:33,239
University of Vermont but their pots are

1376
01:01:29,730 --> 01:01:35,369
a lot smaller so here's an example of

1377
01:01:33,239 --> 01:01:38,219
what one of the blocks looked like for

1378
01:01:35,369 --> 01:01:39,900
the winter annuals about a year ago so

1379
01:01:38,219 --> 01:01:41,730
you can see across the four treatments

1380
01:01:39,900 --> 01:01:43,590
there's sort of a variation in the shade

1381
01:01:41,730 --> 01:01:45,719
of green which is indicative of the

1382
01:01:43,590 --> 01:01:50,460
different mixtures of crops that are

1383
01:01:45,719 --> 01:01:51,149
present in each treatment so so far for

1384
01:01:50,460 --> 01:01:53,940
my methods

1385
01:01:51,150 --> 01:01:56,430
last fall I went out to the fields and

1386
01:01:53,940 --> 01:01:58,320
collected foliar samples with the intent

1387
01:01:56,429 --> 01:01:59,849
to identify some failure diseases and

1388
01:01:58,320 --> 01:02:02,160
then compare and check for overwintering

1389
01:01:59,849 --> 01:02:03,750
this spring so this involves collecting

1390
01:02:02,159 --> 01:02:05,670
foliar tissue samples and bringing them

1391
01:02:03,750 --> 01:02:08,250
back to the lab surface sterilizing the

1392
01:02:05,670 --> 01:02:10,079
tissue planning it on PDA and sub

1393
01:02:08,250 --> 01:02:12,659
culturing the colonies onto fresh plates

1394
01:02:10,079 --> 01:02:15,210
for identification on the right this is

1395
01:02:12,659 --> 01:02:17,909
probably threaded from on clover this is

1396
01:02:15,210 --> 01:02:20,820
commonly known as City blotch so you can

1397
01:02:17,909 --> 01:02:23,339
see I make sort of that dot pattern on

1398
01:02:20,820 --> 01:02:27,420
the clover itself and then it has kind

1399
01:02:23,340 --> 01:02:31,619
of a wild pic snowman look under the

1400
01:02:27,420 --> 01:02:33,960
microscope so these are all of the

1401
01:02:31,619 --> 01:02:35,940
foliar diseases that I was able to

1402
01:02:33,960 --> 01:02:38,099
identify in the fall I just want to draw

1403
01:02:35,940 --> 01:02:38,970
your attention to circus row which is a

1404
01:02:38,099 --> 01:02:41,219
leaf spot

1405
01:02:38,969 --> 01:02:42,839
found on both alfalfa and clover in the

1406
01:02:41,219 --> 01:02:44,849
perennial system so we are already

1407
01:02:42,840 --> 01:02:46,980
starting to see some cross of diseases

1408
01:02:44,849 --> 01:02:50,639
onto multiple species which is something

1409
01:02:46,980 --> 01:02:52,860
that I'm particularly looking for so

1410
01:02:50,639 --> 01:02:54,569
starting next week and then again once

1411
01:02:52,860 --> 01:02:56,340
in the summer and next fall I'll be

1412
01:02:54,570 --> 01:02:58,890
taking both incidents and severity

1413
01:02:56,340 --> 01:03:00,600
measurements in each of these pots so

1414
01:02:58,889 --> 01:03:02,940
I'm gonna for the incidence measurements

1415
01:03:00,599 --> 01:03:05,190
I will be placing five quadrats in each

1416
01:03:02,940 --> 01:03:06,780
plot and looking at the percent of the

1417
01:03:05,190 --> 01:03:08,550
plants out of all the plants in the

1418
01:03:06,780 --> 01:03:12,300
quadrat that are infected with some sort

1419
01:03:08,550 --> 01:03:15,450
of foliar disease and I will then repeat

1420
01:03:12,300 --> 01:03:17,880
this in September and some folks from at

1421
01:03:15,449 --> 01:03:21,779
Brian's that are nice enough to do a

1422
01:03:17,880 --> 01:03:24,750
smaller measurement of this in July I am

1423
01:03:21,780 --> 01:03:26,970
gone and then the severity measurements

1424
01:03:24,750 --> 01:03:29,550
will involve the same laying down five

1425
01:03:26,969 --> 01:03:30,989
quadrats or plot and using up control

1426
01:03:29,550 --> 01:03:33,840
graphs such as the one shown here for

1427
01:03:30,989 --> 01:03:39,059
alfalfa to estimate the percentage of

1428
01:03:33,840 --> 01:03:40,980
disease in each quadrat so I would just

1429
01:03:39,059 --> 01:03:42,900
like to think everyone I worked with in

1430
01:03:40,980 --> 01:03:44,760
the Bergstrom lab especially my PI Gary

1431
01:03:42,900 --> 01:03:46,980
Bergstrom and the lab manager Jamie

1432
01:03:44,760 --> 01:03:48,870
Cummings and the Matt Ryan lab for

1433
01:03:46,980 --> 01:03:51,360
growing these plants and fertilizing

1434
01:03:48,869 --> 01:03:54,599
them and doing all the other wonderful

1435
01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:56,099
things to help them grow my mentor is my

1436
01:03:54,599 --> 01:03:58,380
culture who's a graduate student in

1437
01:03:56,099 --> 01:04:00,360
plant pathology and my contact in a Matt

1438
01:03:58,380 --> 01:04:02,250
Ryan lab is and Bybee Henley who's a

1439
01:04:00,360 --> 01:04:04,620
graduate student in silent sciences I

1440
01:04:02,250 --> 01:04:06,960
also want to thank the hatch supplement

1441
01:04:04,619 --> 01:04:08,509
for supporting my research and I will

1442
01:04:06,960 --> 01:04:14,099
take any questions

1443
01:04:08,510 --> 01:04:16,780
[Applause]

1444
01:04:14,099 --> 01:04:19,839
thanks for that presentation so I'm a

1445
01:04:16,780 --> 01:04:21,820
fan of Matt Ryan's work and so um I like

1446
01:04:19,840 --> 01:04:23,680
the idea of intercropping but we want to

1447
01:04:21,820 --> 01:04:26,200
make it as easy as possible for farmers

1448
01:04:23,679 --> 01:04:27,549
and yeah and so it's not very easy to to

1449
01:04:26,199 --> 01:04:29,319
do with three or more different

1450
01:04:27,550 --> 01:04:32,789
commodity markets if you want to be able

1451
01:04:29,320 --> 01:04:36,700
to to sell your season's harvests of

1452
01:04:32,789 --> 01:04:38,829
corn and soybean and oats it might be a

1453
01:04:36,699 --> 01:04:41,799
lot of work but I like the idea of

1454
01:04:38,829 --> 01:04:44,380
intercropping so there's quite a lot of

1455
01:04:41,800 --> 01:04:47,830
phenotypic diversity within a single

1456
01:04:44,380 --> 01:04:50,619
crop species so is there a way for this

1457
01:04:47,829 --> 01:04:52,929
format Ryan and others doing his work to

1458
01:04:50,619 --> 01:04:55,690
focus more on you know a single type of

1459
01:04:52,929 --> 01:04:57,819
commodity market where you have you're

1460
01:04:55,690 --> 01:05:01,750
dealing with cultivars that span

1461
01:04:57,820 --> 01:05:04,360
different genotypic diversity and that's

1462
01:05:01,750 --> 01:05:07,539
and that's targeted to whatever pest

1463
01:05:04,360 --> 01:05:09,400
pressures there are or if it's resistant

1464
01:05:07,539 --> 01:05:11,500
if you're trying to tolerate some kind

1465
01:05:09,400 --> 01:05:14,010
of change in climatic conditions but

1466
01:05:11,500 --> 01:05:17,500
just really have it so that it's it's

1467
01:05:14,010 --> 01:05:18,940
diversifying your your farm but also you

1468
01:05:17,500 --> 01:05:20,920
want to make it easy on the farmers and

1469
01:05:18,940 --> 01:05:23,170
just if they want to deal with a single

1470
01:05:20,920 --> 01:05:25,539
commodity market then let them but the

1471
01:05:23,170 --> 01:05:27,880
ideas are absolutely applicable but it's

1472
01:05:25,539 --> 01:05:30,369
just simply instead of multiple crops of

1473
01:05:27,880 --> 01:05:32,800
species multiple species of crops

1474
01:05:30,369 --> 01:05:36,159
it's just multiple genotypes of within a

1475
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:38,560
comp yeah so I think there's a couple of

1476
01:05:36,159 --> 01:05:40,119
things that the Matt Ryan lab has done

1477
01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:41,590
to make this conducive to farmers I

1478
01:05:40,119 --> 01:05:43,630
think first of all the mixed

1479
01:05:41,590 --> 01:05:44,829
intercropping system where everything

1480
01:05:43,630 --> 01:05:46,869
can be planted together you don't have

1481
01:05:44,829 --> 01:05:49,329
to do three separate planting regimens

1482
01:05:46,869 --> 01:05:50,980
makes it a little bit easier we also do

1483
01:05:49,329 --> 01:05:52,690
have the con specific treatment which is

1484
01:05:50,980 --> 01:05:55,750
just different genotypes of one plant

1485
01:05:52,690 --> 01:05:57,700
which I think helps a lot one thing that

1486
01:05:55,750 --> 01:06:00,820
I think is a particularly a struggle

1487
01:05:57,699 --> 01:06:02,049
with this is the optimal harvest time

1488
01:06:00,820 --> 01:06:04,710
for each of these forage crops is a

1489
01:06:02,050 --> 01:06:07,600
little bit different so it's hard to

1490
01:06:04,710 --> 01:06:09,610
decide when to harvest the high

1491
01:06:07,599 --> 01:06:11,319
diversity forage crop because you might

1492
01:06:09,610 --> 01:06:13,510
not get the optimal forage quality of

1493
01:06:11,320 --> 01:06:16,809
some of the different crops you have in

1494
01:06:13,510 --> 01:06:18,580
there but I do think that versus like a

1495
01:06:16,809 --> 01:06:20,889
corn and soybean intercrop the forages

1496
01:06:18,579 --> 01:06:23,239
are easier to sell in bulk because

1497
01:06:20,889 --> 01:06:29,319
they're just going directly toward

1498
01:06:23,239 --> 01:06:29,319
livestock feed so other questions

1499
01:06:35,659 --> 01:06:37,719
you

1500
01:06:42,940 --> 01:06:51,559
our next speaker is will Dahl who also

1501
01:06:47,210 --> 01:06:55,429
change the title the title of his talk

1502
01:06:51,559 --> 01:06:55,969
is crisper cast 9 in Lemna minor hi

1503
01:06:55,429 --> 01:06:57,889
everyone

1504
01:06:55,969 --> 01:06:59,059
I'm will and today I'll be talking to

1505
01:06:57,889 --> 01:07:02,150
you about my efforts to implement

1506
01:06:59,059 --> 01:07:05,210
crisper gas 9 in the duck weed species

1507
01:07:02,150 --> 01:07:08,420
limited minor so why am I talking about

1508
01:07:05,210 --> 01:07:09,860
duck weed well it's a small aquatic

1509
01:07:08,420 --> 01:07:12,320
plant which grows on the surface of

1510
01:07:09,860 --> 01:07:13,789
fresh water and it has some of the it's

1511
01:07:12,320 --> 01:07:16,850
one of the smallest flowering plants in

1512
01:07:13,789 --> 01:07:18,139
the world I'm dealing with Lemna which

1513
01:07:16,849 --> 01:07:21,679
is right in the middle here but there

1514
01:07:18,139 --> 01:07:25,789
are five genera with 37 species and each

1515
01:07:21,679 --> 01:07:27,799
of them is smaller than a quarter so it

1516
01:07:25,789 --> 01:07:30,409
was recently demoted from its own family

1517
01:07:27,800 --> 01:07:33,070
lamiaceae a to alumni da the subfamily

1518
01:07:30,409 --> 01:07:36,859
of her Asya that's a recent development

1519
01:07:33,070 --> 01:07:40,430
and so I'm right in the middle here with

1520
01:07:36,860 --> 01:07:42,680
lambda minor so duck weed is a good

1521
01:07:40,429 --> 01:07:44,960
candidate for both bioremediation and

1522
01:07:42,679 --> 01:07:47,449
biofuels because it has a high tolerance

1523
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:49,309
to high nitrogen concentrations and

1524
01:07:47,449 --> 01:07:50,869
phosphorus concentrations which are

1525
01:07:49,309 --> 01:07:54,049
characteristic of agricultural runoff

1526
01:07:50,869 --> 01:07:57,589
and wastewater so we can use it in

1527
01:07:54,050 --> 01:08:00,260
runoff zones to absorb a lot of nitrogen

1528
01:07:57,590 --> 01:08:03,980
and phosphorus it also has a very high

1529
01:08:00,260 --> 01:08:06,320
growth rate this disputed time of 16

1530
01:08:03,980 --> 01:08:09,050
hours is actually a little bit low it's

1531
01:08:06,320 --> 01:08:12,950
as a doubling time of about a day and a

1532
01:08:09,050 --> 01:08:14,930
half four and a half days so currently

1533
01:08:12,949 --> 01:08:18,229
the US produces about half of the

1534
01:08:14,929 --> 01:08:20,510
world's biofuels primarily with corn and

1535
01:08:18,229 --> 01:08:24,409
soybean but if we can add another system

1536
01:08:20,510 --> 01:08:25,880
that could also be doubly used as a

1537
01:08:24,409 --> 01:08:30,318
candidate for bioremediation

1538
01:08:25,880 --> 01:08:32,750
the effect so as you can see it's it's

1539
01:08:30,319 --> 01:08:34,190
somewhat of an invasive species this is

1540
01:08:32,750 --> 01:08:38,079
the picture from Prospect Park where

1541
01:08:34,189 --> 01:08:40,969
it's totally overtaken this area but

1542
01:08:38,079 --> 01:08:44,930
it's indicative of how quickly it can

1543
01:08:40,970 --> 01:08:47,210
actually grow so it has a very fast

1544
01:08:44,930 --> 01:08:49,010
doubling time and it has a very high

1545
01:08:47,210 --> 01:08:51,710
lipid content relative to the lignin and

1546
01:08:49,010 --> 01:08:53,960
other contaminants that might make it

1547
01:08:51,710 --> 01:08:56,279
difficult to actually remove try a

1548
01:08:53,960 --> 01:09:01,560
solicitor and use it

1549
01:08:56,279 --> 01:09:03,840
biofuels so in preliminary assemblies

1550
01:09:01,560 --> 01:09:06,830
found a lot of worth logs for genes that

1551
01:09:03,840 --> 01:09:10,140
have been used in other systems to

1552
01:09:06,829 --> 01:09:12,460
promote trials of glycerol hyper

1553
01:09:10,140 --> 01:09:14,230
accumulation

1554
01:09:12,460 --> 01:09:17,710
but duckweed has some challenges

1555
01:09:14,229 --> 01:09:19,048
associated with it we don't have a

1556
01:09:17,710 --> 01:09:22,420
complete picture of all the genomes

1557
01:09:19,048 --> 01:09:23,949
Lebanon Minor is the farthest along so

1558
01:09:22,420 --> 01:09:28,359
we've identified the most genes in it

1559
01:09:23,949 --> 01:09:31,000
and a lot of other strategies using a

1560
01:09:28,359 --> 01:09:33,548
rabbit OPS's for instance aren't going

1561
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:36,488
to work very well in duckweed because it

1562
01:09:33,548 --> 01:09:39,488
propagates clonally primarily we can't

1563
01:09:36,488 --> 01:09:43,718
really use the floral dip staple

1564
01:09:39,488 --> 01:09:45,909
expression strategy and here's a lemon

1565
01:09:43,719 --> 01:09:48,009
that give a flower which is among the

1566
01:09:45,909 --> 01:09:50,229
largest species in the genus that I'm

1567
01:09:48,009 --> 01:09:52,600
working in and you can see it's pistils

1568
01:09:50,229 --> 01:09:54,779
and it's anthers and it's only about a

1569
01:09:52,600 --> 01:09:57,610
millimeter to two millimeters long and

1570
01:09:54,779 --> 01:10:00,340
it is only produced and they're very

1571
01:09:57,609 --> 01:10:03,149
stressed out conditions so we have to

1572
01:10:00,340 --> 01:10:05,890
find a way to achieve stable expression

1573
01:10:03,149 --> 01:10:07,899
so the first thing that we tried was to

1574
01:10:05,890 --> 01:10:10,810
transform the dirt the meristem via

1575
01:10:07,899 --> 01:10:12,639
direct injection and we tried to develop

1576
01:10:10,810 --> 01:10:17,560
that with an artificial micro RNA

1577
01:10:12,640 --> 01:10:20,079
construct regimen that didn't work very

1578
01:10:17,560 --> 01:10:22,239
well the expression was biased towards

1579
01:10:20,079 --> 01:10:23,800
the vasculature and we were unable to

1580
01:10:22,238 --> 01:10:26,500
achieve stable expression throughout

1581
01:10:23,800 --> 01:10:30,880
many generations so we're exploiting the

1582
01:10:26,500 --> 01:10:33,699
callus State which is a strategy used by

1583
01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:35,829
the duckweed to D differentiate and

1584
01:10:33,699 --> 01:10:37,929
accumulate a lot of carbohydrates in

1585
01:10:35,829 --> 01:10:41,769
order to avoid abiotic stressors such as

1586
01:10:37,930 --> 01:10:43,300
frost so D differentiates into a clump

1587
01:10:41,770 --> 01:10:46,780
of tissue that then sinks to the bottom

1588
01:10:43,300 --> 01:10:47,400
of ponds where it can avoid being frozen

1589
01:10:46,779 --> 01:10:50,439
to death

1590
01:10:47,399 --> 01:10:52,689
so we induced the state using hormones

1591
01:10:50,439 --> 01:10:56,738
and then transform the callus using

1592
01:10:52,689 --> 01:10:58,689
vacuum infiltration that protocol is

1593
01:10:56,738 --> 01:11:01,988
also used with the artificial micro RNA

1594
01:10:58,689 --> 01:11:05,019
constructs and we've tried many

1595
01:11:01,988 --> 01:11:07,889
different promoters some of them we

1596
01:11:05,020 --> 01:11:11,130
tried P 35 s ubiquitin from maize and

1597
01:11:07,890 --> 01:11:13,539
then some native Rubisco promoters and

1598
01:11:11,130 --> 01:11:14,920
we've run into some issues with them so

1599
01:11:13,539 --> 01:11:20,949
we're trying different combinations of

1600
01:11:14,920 --> 01:11:25,130
promoters as well so I am trying to

1601
01:11:20,949 --> 01:11:28,460
promote to small guys at a time gas 9

1602
01:11:25,130 --> 01:11:30,650
and some associated tags such as em

1603
01:11:28,460 --> 01:11:34,069
cherry which is prepended to the cast

1604
01:11:30,649 --> 01:11:35,960
nine and a nuclear localization motif

1605
01:11:34,069 --> 01:11:37,309
which has also added the cast on so it

1606
01:11:35,960 --> 01:11:40,730
can be expressed in the nucleus and

1607
01:11:37,310 --> 01:11:43,670
actually cut the DNA so these are three

1608
01:11:40,729 --> 01:11:45,678
gene targets for my small guides which I

1609
01:11:43,670 --> 01:11:47,779
made it the farthest with the person is

1610
01:11:45,679 --> 01:11:51,289
Fido in desaturates which is ortholog

1611
01:11:47,779 --> 01:11:53,119
from solanum and bio induced gene

1612
01:11:51,289 --> 01:11:56,329
silencing in jatropha which is another

1613
01:11:53,119 --> 01:11:58,609
plant that's been used for biofuels

1614
01:11:56,329 --> 01:12:01,340
applications it's a succulent with high

1615
01:11:58,609 --> 01:12:05,119
triacylglycerol content has been shown

1616
01:12:01,340 --> 01:12:08,630
to accumulate tag and also result in a

1617
01:12:05,119 --> 01:12:11,479
bleach leaves phenotype there's a sugar

1618
01:12:08,630 --> 01:12:14,779
defendant one which is actually sdp one

1619
01:12:11,479 --> 01:12:16,908
not SPG one which could be confusing so

1620
01:12:14,779 --> 01:12:20,929
that's sealing classes development my

1621
01:12:16,908 --> 01:12:22,879
bad it's actually a lipase which causes

1622
01:12:20,929 --> 01:12:24,980
the breakdown of triacylglycerol and

1623
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:26,510
when we can knock that out we can

1624
01:12:24,979 --> 01:12:29,238
maintain try acid Lister all

1625
01:12:26,510 --> 01:12:31,579
concentrations which are desirable from

1626
01:12:29,238 --> 01:12:33,948
other transformations such as wrinkled

1627
01:12:31,579 --> 01:12:38,090
one and diacylglycerol acid transferase

1628
01:12:33,948 --> 01:12:41,149
and then finally we have TG b1 which is

1629
01:12:38,090 --> 01:12:45,770
try galactose 'l diacylglycerol which is

1630
01:12:41,149 --> 01:12:48,198
a transporter and it can also accumulate

1631
01:12:45,770 --> 01:12:50,090
try a slow glycerol and Arabidopsis so

1632
01:12:48,198 --> 01:12:54,198
these are the three gene targets that I

1633
01:12:50,090 --> 01:12:58,010
made the farthest with small guides up

1634
01:12:54,198 --> 01:12:59,899
here so I've had some issues of actually

1635
01:12:58,010 --> 01:13:02,389
detecting caste 9 once I've transformed

1636
01:12:59,899 --> 01:13:04,189
it it's typically in low abundance and

1637
01:13:02,389 --> 01:13:06,469
because of my nuclear localization

1638
01:13:04,189 --> 01:13:08,210
signal it was been it's been hard to

1639
01:13:06,469 --> 01:13:12,170
actually detect from vegetative tissue

1640
01:13:08,210 --> 01:13:14,810
so I extracted nuclei try to detect it

1641
01:13:12,170 --> 01:13:17,719
directly and then I've also tried to

1642
01:13:14,810 --> 01:13:20,389
optimize caste 9 because I used SP gas 9

1643
01:13:17,719 --> 01:13:23,029
which is optimized around 37 degrees

1644
01:13:20,389 --> 01:13:25,940
Celsius and so I actually grew the

1645
01:13:23,029 --> 01:13:28,069
duckweed at 37 degrees Celsius to make

1646
01:13:25,939 --> 01:13:29,960
the this particular enzyme happier

1647
01:13:28,069 --> 01:13:35,448
because the duckweed doesn't really care

1648
01:13:29,960 --> 01:13:37,980
about that I've been using to guide

1649
01:13:35,448 --> 01:13:40,259
targets in some

1650
01:13:37,979 --> 01:13:42,329
situations and one in others what we

1651
01:13:40,260 --> 01:13:48,900
would expect to see if one guide works

1652
01:13:42,329 --> 01:13:50,369
is a an indelible reducing motif but if

1653
01:13:48,899 --> 01:13:52,679
to work we would expect to see a

1654
01:13:50,369 --> 01:13:55,619
complete deletion via non-homologous end

1655
01:13:52,680 --> 01:13:59,220
joining so to detect cast 9 I've

1656
01:13:55,619 --> 01:14:01,859
targeted M cherry with antibodies and

1657
01:13:59,220 --> 01:14:05,850
also try to detect my small guys with

1658
01:14:01,859 --> 01:14:09,000
rt-pcr and that has so far been a little

1659
01:14:05,850 --> 01:14:11,310
bit difficult so the goal would be to

1660
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:13,590
achieve stable expression of high lipid

1661
01:14:11,310 --> 01:14:15,690
content which would result in low

1662
01:14:13,590 --> 01:14:18,510
carbohydrate content because of the load

1663
01:14:15,689 --> 01:14:21,689
of producing more proportionately more

1664
01:14:18,510 --> 01:14:24,329
lipids we would like to see the growth

1665
01:14:21,689 --> 01:14:26,309
viability stay in shape which would be

1666
01:14:24,329 --> 01:14:28,199
nice if it could survive accumulating

1667
01:14:26,310 --> 01:14:30,239
all these lipids and I'd like to

1668
01:14:28,199 --> 01:14:33,029
directly detect cast on the small guide

1669
01:14:30,238 --> 01:14:36,889
and the higher lipid content so it would

1670
01:14:33,029 --> 01:14:39,659
result in a bleach leaves phenotype like

1671
01:14:36,890 --> 01:14:42,090
so at this point I'm not complete with

1672
01:14:39,659 --> 01:14:43,920
the project but we could have

1673
01:14:42,090 --> 01:14:46,079
successfully transformed cast 9 already

1674
01:14:43,920 --> 01:14:49,920
and had a failure to delete on the

1675
01:14:46,079 --> 01:14:51,300
pesticide we could also have run into

1676
01:14:49,920 --> 01:14:56,670
some issues with the promoters that

1677
01:14:51,300 --> 01:14:59,850
we're currently using so that's possible

1678
01:14:56,670 --> 01:15:02,489
and on the other end of possibility I

1679
01:14:59,850 --> 01:15:05,070
could to go back and detect gas 9 and

1680
01:15:02,488 --> 01:15:06,899
then also detect my small guides and the

1681
01:15:05,069 --> 01:15:09,630
deletion which would be the absolute

1682
01:15:06,899 --> 01:15:14,009
best case scenario but I have yet to do

1683
01:15:09,630 --> 01:15:16,140
that so this would be ideal is if my

1684
01:15:14,010 --> 01:15:18,150
small guide there thereby cats 9 is

1685
01:15:16,140 --> 01:15:23,910
there and I actually delete the gene

1686
01:15:18,149 --> 01:15:25,920
that I wanted please so currently I have

1687
01:15:23,909 --> 01:15:28,859
seen of leech leaves phenotype unique to

1688
01:15:25,920 --> 01:15:30,899
37 degrees Celsius transformants so

1689
01:15:28,859 --> 01:15:35,670
hopefully that means that the deletion

1690
01:15:30,899 --> 01:15:39,238
is working and I've also detected small

1691
01:15:35,670 --> 01:15:41,130
guide via RT PCR but it's I need to redo

1692
01:15:39,238 --> 01:15:42,659
it because I'm reaching the end stages

1693
01:15:41,130 --> 01:15:46,500
of actually detecting all these things

1694
01:15:42,659 --> 01:15:48,539
and I have not yet conclusively detected

1695
01:15:46,500 --> 01:15:50,488
all of them the Cassadine is still

1696
01:15:48,539 --> 01:15:51,969
difficult to detect I did my first

1697
01:15:50,488 --> 01:15:57,488
Western blot

1698
01:15:51,969 --> 01:15:59,050
on Jerry and so my antibodies might be

1699
01:15:57,488 --> 01:16:03,899
off there might be a lot of issues with

1700
01:15:59,050 --> 01:16:03,900
it but we'll see and then my rt-pcr

1701
01:16:04,889 --> 01:16:09,849
so with that that's where I'm up to you

1702
01:16:08,170 --> 01:16:12,190
right now and I'd like to thank my

1703
01:16:09,849 --> 01:16:16,599
mentor Jas

1704
01:16:12,189 --> 01:16:18,669
my other mentor Evan and the duckweed

1705
01:16:16,599 --> 01:16:22,179
team Joe Almudena

1706
01:16:18,670 --> 01:16:24,760
and uma and Alex who did a lot of work

1707
01:16:22,179 --> 01:16:29,260
on the artificial micro rna's and then

1708
01:16:24,760 --> 01:16:43,300
my my p.i rob partington and I'll take

1709
01:16:29,260 --> 01:16:46,329
any questions question I know it's a

1710
01:16:43,300 --> 01:16:47,979
preliminary result but what about what

1711
01:16:46,328 --> 01:16:50,558
frequency did you see the bleached

1712
01:16:47,979 --> 01:16:52,749
phenotype in you're pretty high but only

1713
01:16:50,559 --> 01:16:57,070
for Fito in desaturates

1714
01:16:52,748 --> 01:17:02,309
so I'd say about 80% for Fito in

1715
01:16:57,069 --> 01:17:08,408
saturates but no other transformers yet

1716
01:17:02,309 --> 01:17:11,550
question so maybe I missed this in the

1717
01:17:08,408 --> 01:17:14,558
beginning part of your talk where you

1718
01:17:11,550 --> 01:17:17,110
outline experimental to design but is

1719
01:17:14,559 --> 01:17:19,599
the gold then to knock these genes out

1720
01:17:17,109 --> 01:17:22,238
or are you trying to adjust the

1721
01:17:19,599 --> 01:17:24,969
expression of these using guide RNAs to

1722
01:17:22,238 --> 01:17:28,058
the promoters we're trying to knock them

1723
01:17:24,969 --> 01:17:29,198
out for these three genes and then we

1724
01:17:28,059 --> 01:17:32,710
have different strategies for other

1725
01:17:29,198 --> 01:17:35,738
genes so we've promoted wrinkled and you

1726
01:17:32,710 --> 01:17:38,618
got to try and promote triacylglycerol

1727
01:17:35,738 --> 01:17:41,379
accumulation but these genes are also

1728
01:17:38,618 --> 01:17:44,589
associated there's a already established

1729
01:17:41,380 --> 01:17:46,359
three gene strategy for tryouts the

1730
01:17:44,590 --> 01:17:48,369
glycerol hyper accumulation in other

1731
01:17:46,359 --> 01:17:50,380
systems so we've been kind of following

1732
01:17:48,368 --> 01:17:51,939
that and these are just the genes that I

1733
01:17:50,380 --> 01:17:56,559
happen to make it farthest with and they

1734
01:17:51,939 --> 01:17:58,948
all happen to be knockouts the questions

1735
01:17:56,559 --> 01:17:58,949
for will

1736
01:18:02,658 --> 01:18:13,819
I I love asking molecular biologists an

1737
01:18:10,219 --> 01:18:16,698
ecology question so I'm fascinated by

1738
01:18:13,819 --> 01:18:20,179
Levi's Lemna the duck weeds and other

1739
01:18:16,698 --> 01:18:22,788
floating aquatic plants so is this like

1740
01:18:20,179 --> 01:18:25,880
a serious bioenergy crop and what other

1741
01:18:22,788 --> 01:18:28,518
types of species like a Zola or some

1742
01:18:25,880 --> 01:18:31,248
others are they now targeting for

1743
01:18:28,519 --> 01:18:33,320
biofuel crops we think it's serious we

1744
01:18:31,248 --> 01:18:36,948
hope it's serious we've been at it for

1745
01:18:33,319 --> 01:18:39,529
about five years now algea seems to be

1746
01:18:36,948 --> 01:18:42,859
almost a better option at this point but

1747
01:18:39,529 --> 01:18:44,809
uh right now we're really hoping that we

1748
01:18:42,859 --> 01:18:46,938
can do a good job because it's an

1749
01:18:44,809 --> 01:18:48,829
accumulate biomass so quickly and it's

1750
01:18:46,939 --> 01:18:51,918
also very resistant it's the highest

1751
01:18:48,828 --> 01:18:55,130
growth rate among the higher plants so

1752
01:18:51,918 --> 01:18:56,448
hopefully it can do the same thing with

1753
01:18:55,130 --> 01:19:00,309
stand the same conditions that we've

1754
01:18:56,448 --> 01:19:03,428
seen in vitro and actually accumulate

1755
01:19:00,309 --> 01:19:06,829
the fats that we needed to accumulate

1756
01:19:03,429 --> 01:19:12,099
hopefully the questions Rob is pretty

1757
01:19:06,828 --> 01:19:12,099
serious all right thank you

1758
01:19:12,550 --> 01:19:14,610
you

1759
01:19:20,489 --> 01:19:27,069
our next speaker is Jeffrey yen and the

1760
01:19:23,979 --> 01:19:31,119
title of his talk is comparative legal

1761
01:19:27,069 --> 01:19:33,460
development in PO AC my name is Jeffrey

1762
01:19:31,119 --> 01:19:36,039
and I'm a student working in Mike

1763
01:19:33,460 --> 01:19:38,079
Scanlon slab studying comparative legal

1764
01:19:36,039 --> 01:19:41,079
development and similar to Allison I'm

1765
01:19:38,079 --> 01:19:46,029
also on a December 2018 graduate so

1766
01:19:41,079 --> 01:19:48,069
might not have as much the first thing

1767
01:19:46,029 --> 01:19:49,899
I'd like to talk about is what is a lick

1768
01:19:48,069 --> 01:19:52,420
you and why we basically care about it

1769
01:19:49,899 --> 01:19:54,609
if we look at a grass leaf it is

1770
01:19:52,420 --> 01:19:57,159
composed of sheath that wraps around the

1771
01:19:54,609 --> 01:19:59,859
stem and also a corresponding blade

1772
01:19:57,159 --> 01:20:02,920
portion that extends away from the stem

1773
01:19:59,859 --> 01:20:04,630
so if we look at the region in which the

1774
01:20:02,920 --> 01:20:07,149
two intersect we can define a region

1775
01:20:04,630 --> 01:20:09,190
called the blade sheath boundary at this

1776
01:20:07,149 --> 01:20:11,619
blade she's boundary we have a structure

1777
01:20:09,189 --> 01:20:14,409
called an Oracle here that is a wedge

1778
01:20:11,619 --> 01:20:17,109
that allows the blade to extend outwards

1779
01:20:14,409 --> 01:20:19,090
to maximize light capture and also we

1780
01:20:17,109 --> 01:20:21,299
have the ligament region which is an

1781
01:20:19,090 --> 01:20:25,539
epidermal e derived fringe of tissue on

1782
01:20:21,300 --> 01:20:27,430
the top side of the leaf so very

1783
01:20:25,539 --> 01:20:29,890
fundamental question in developmental

1784
01:20:27,430 --> 01:20:32,320
biology is the formation of boundaries

1785
01:20:29,890 --> 01:20:35,470
so here we can see the shoot apical

1786
01:20:32,319 --> 01:20:37,569
meristem of a plant and when a new leaf

1787
01:20:35,470 --> 01:20:39,579
primordia initiates what has to happen

1788
01:20:37,569 --> 01:20:42,189
is that we have to create a boundary

1789
01:20:39,579 --> 01:20:44,979
here that separates domains inside the

1790
01:20:42,189 --> 01:20:47,889
leaf primordia and the shoot apical

1791
01:20:44,979 --> 01:20:49,719
meristem very similarly in floral

1792
01:20:47,890 --> 01:20:52,750
development we also get formation but

1793
01:20:49,720 --> 01:20:55,900
boundaries signified here as these green

1794
01:20:52,750 --> 01:20:58,180
strips of tissue so what's interesting

1795
01:20:55,899 --> 01:21:00,519
about this project is that the Lydia is

1796
01:20:58,180 --> 01:21:02,440
in fact at the location of the blade

1797
01:21:00,520 --> 01:21:04,650
sheet boundary and would like to

1798
01:21:02,439 --> 01:21:06,609
understand how the formation of legal

1799
01:21:04,649 --> 01:21:08,109
development contributes to the

1800
01:21:06,609 --> 01:21:11,199
establishment of the blade sheath

1801
01:21:08,109 --> 01:21:12,639
boundary so when we're talking about

1802
01:21:11,199 --> 01:21:15,250
development the first things we like to

1803
01:21:12,640 --> 01:21:17,440
ask about is the enough taja knee and

1804
01:21:15,250 --> 01:21:20,350
what I mean by that is the developmental

1805
01:21:17,439 --> 01:21:23,079
sequence in which has to occur for this

1806
01:21:20,350 --> 01:21:25,840
particular structure to form so here we

1807
01:21:23,079 --> 01:21:29,050
have a histological section of a

1808
01:21:25,840 --> 01:21:31,239
longitudinal section of a maze Epis II

1809
01:21:29,050 --> 01:21:33,880
in which here we can clearly see that we

1810
01:21:31,239 --> 01:21:36,039
have the shoot apical meristem and some

1811
01:21:33,880 --> 01:21:37,690
leaf primordia there are just initiating

1812
01:21:36,039 --> 01:21:39,939
what I like to bring to your attention

1813
01:21:37,689 --> 01:21:42,729
is that as we go further and further

1814
01:21:39,939 --> 01:21:44,859
away from the shoot apical meristem the

1815
01:21:42,729 --> 01:21:47,589
leaves are more mature in developmental

1816
01:21:44,859 --> 01:21:51,099
age we can denote its developmental

1817
01:21:47,590 --> 01:21:53,469
stage by giving each leaf a plastic

1818
01:21:51,100 --> 01:21:56,050
wrong number in which the newly

1819
01:21:53,469 --> 01:21:58,480
initiated leaf will be called plastic on

1820
01:21:56,050 --> 01:22:01,210
number one the second one here will be

1821
01:21:58,479 --> 01:22:03,369
loud classical number two and the number

1822
01:22:01,210 --> 01:22:06,670
increases as we get more and more mature

1823
01:22:03,369 --> 01:22:10,000
leaf structures here we can see that in

1824
01:22:06,670 --> 01:22:11,889
a maize plant around pasarán seven we

1825
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:14,800
don't see any morphological changes

1826
01:22:11,889 --> 01:22:16,989
associated with likio formation however

1827
01:22:14,800 --> 01:22:19,420
during plastic on 8 we get this little

1828
01:22:16,988 --> 01:22:23,138
tiny bump that's going to correspond to

1829
01:22:19,420 --> 01:22:25,119
where the Lydia is going to develop so

1830
01:22:23,139 --> 01:22:28,600
to give a little bit more insight on to

1831
01:22:25,119 --> 01:22:30,189
how this process occurs we can hear how

1832
01:22:28,600 --> 01:22:32,739
the depiction of what just cells

1833
01:22:30,189 --> 01:22:34,419
looking at it at its surface view what

1834
01:22:32,738 --> 01:22:36,879
has to happen first is that you get a

1835
01:22:34,420 --> 01:22:40,329
series of cell divisions that create

1836
01:22:36,880 --> 01:22:43,150
these very long cells that are fat in

1837
01:22:40,329 --> 01:22:45,010
appearance on an SEM image you can see

1838
01:22:43,149 --> 01:22:47,948
them right here in which we call this

1839
01:22:45,010 --> 01:22:50,199
the pre module band a little bit later

1840
01:22:47,948 --> 01:22:52,689
in development the pre leg you'll ban

1841
01:22:50,198 --> 01:22:54,908
would start dividing parallel to the

1842
01:22:52,689 --> 01:22:57,250
surface of the leaf pushing a layer of

1843
01:22:54,908 --> 01:23:00,129
cells outwards to create what's called a

1844
01:22:57,250 --> 01:23:02,469
pre little Ridge we can nicely see the

1845
01:23:00,130 --> 01:23:06,039
pre Lego Ridge here on this SEM image

1846
01:23:02,469 --> 01:23:08,380
and this structure is going to grow into

1847
01:23:06,039 --> 01:23:12,219
the mature legal structure later in

1848
01:23:08,380 --> 01:23:14,650
plant development so a lot of insights

1849
01:23:12,219 --> 01:23:17,889
have been obtained through studying the

1850
01:23:14,649 --> 01:23:20,319
genetics in maize and here we have a

1851
01:23:17,889 --> 01:23:22,960
gene of interest called legalist one

1852
01:23:20,319 --> 01:23:24,849
when you have mutations in Lydia Swan we

1853
01:23:22,960 --> 01:23:27,489
get plants that lack both the Arkell

1854
01:23:24,850 --> 01:23:30,100
structure and the little compared to a

1855
01:23:27,488 --> 01:23:31,658
wild-type maize plant we can also see

1856
01:23:30,100 --> 01:23:33,579
that the blade sheath boundary is lot

1857
01:23:31,658 --> 01:23:37,329
less distinct compared to wild-type

1858
01:23:33,579 --> 01:23:39,519
plants if we have mutations in barley

1859
01:23:37,329 --> 01:23:41,920
and maize they create similar phenotypes

1860
01:23:39,520 --> 01:23:45,940
suggesting that this gene is very highly

1861
01:23:41,920 --> 01:23:46,489
conserved within de Graaff species so

1862
01:23:45,939 --> 01:23:50,629
that brings

1863
01:23:46,488 --> 01:23:52,488
me too my model organism which is in the

1864
01:23:50,630 --> 01:23:55,460
kind of clothes species in which if you

1865
01:23:52,488 --> 01:24:00,709
look at its phenotype at least for some

1866
01:23:55,460 --> 01:24:03,139
members of the genus is represented by a

1867
01:24:00,710 --> 01:24:05,389
lack of legal structures yeah it has a

1868
01:24:03,139 --> 01:24:07,969
very nice oracle structure and the blade

1869
01:24:05,389 --> 01:24:10,279
sheath boundary is very distinct so my

1870
01:24:07,969 --> 01:24:13,519
main question of interest is how can

1871
01:24:10,279 --> 01:24:15,920
members in the kind of Chloe family not

1872
01:24:13,519 --> 01:24:17,900
have liguras yet have very nice blade

1873
01:24:15,920 --> 01:24:20,029
sheath boundary formation compared to

1874
01:24:17,899 --> 01:24:23,058
when we have mutations that disrupt the

1875
01:24:20,029 --> 01:24:25,210
league you'll the Oracle and associated

1876
01:24:23,059 --> 01:24:28,610
blade chief boundary is lost in other

1877
01:24:25,210 --> 01:24:31,038
species so to do that I'm going to use

1878
01:24:28,609 --> 01:24:33,759
three experimental approaches first I'm

1879
01:24:31,038 --> 01:24:38,090
looking to examine the ontological

1880
01:24:33,760 --> 01:24:39,530
development of a kind of Chloe and then

1881
01:24:38,090 --> 01:24:42,230
I'm going to look at candidate gene

1882
01:24:39,529 --> 01:24:45,380
expression of known genes in maize and

1883
01:24:42,229 --> 01:24:48,018
other grass species that are responsible

1884
01:24:45,380 --> 01:24:49,578
for legal development and lastly I'm

1885
01:24:48,019 --> 01:24:52,489
going to utilize a transcript no-mix

1886
01:24:49,578 --> 01:24:54,738
approach to identify novel gene elements

1887
01:24:52,488 --> 01:24:58,009
that not might not be present in other

1888
01:24:54,738 --> 01:25:00,468
grass species so the first thing I

1889
01:24:58,010 --> 01:25:03,019
wanted to see is that if I can't

1890
01:25:00,469 --> 01:25:05,630
directly observed particular cellular

1891
01:25:03,019 --> 01:25:08,059
differences within these different

1892
01:25:05,630 --> 01:25:11,449
developmental domains so to do that I

1893
01:25:08,059 --> 01:25:13,610
use scanning electron microscopy to look

1894
01:25:11,448 --> 01:25:15,710
at the blade sheet boundary region and

1895
01:25:13,609 --> 01:25:18,018
here we can clearly see that we have

1896
01:25:15,710 --> 01:25:20,868
three distinct domains the blade sheath

1897
01:25:18,019 --> 01:25:22,849
an oracle region if you look more

1898
01:25:20,868 --> 01:25:27,229
closely at the cellular features we can

1899
01:25:22,849 --> 01:25:29,269
see that here we have sheath cells and

1900
01:25:27,229 --> 01:25:31,069
blade cells and you can see that the

1901
01:25:29,269 --> 01:25:33,469
sheath cells are characterized by its

1902
01:25:31,069 --> 01:25:36,590
bumpiness and if we compare it to oracle

1903
01:25:33,469 --> 01:25:39,618
cells we can see that these article

1904
01:25:36,590 --> 01:25:42,619
cells are very odd texturized which

1905
01:25:39,618 --> 01:25:46,219
corresponds to the secretion of waxy

1906
01:25:42,618 --> 01:25:48,439
cuticles on the surface so in order to

1907
01:25:46,219 --> 01:25:50,569
find out when this blade sheath boundary

1908
01:25:48,439 --> 01:25:53,089
kersek in kind of Chloe the first thing

1909
01:25:50,569 --> 01:25:56,448
I did was to do histological sectioning

1910
01:25:53,090 --> 01:25:58,880
to find out if I can find these specific

1911
01:25:56,448 --> 01:25:59,819
cellular characteristics associated with

1912
01:25:58,880 --> 01:26:02,909
sheath

1913
01:25:59,819 --> 01:26:05,299
bleh tissue here we can see that this is

1914
01:26:02,908 --> 01:26:07,710
also a longitudinal section and we

1915
01:26:05,300 --> 01:26:10,199
identify the shoot apical meristem here

1916
01:26:07,710 --> 01:26:13,319
and if we count up fast across here we

1917
01:26:10,198 --> 01:26:16,259
have passed upon one to posture on three

1918
01:26:13,319 --> 01:26:18,389
and oh very plastic on four we can see

1919
01:26:16,260 --> 01:26:20,789
this distinct swelling at the base of

1920
01:26:18,389 --> 01:26:23,099
the tissue whereas the cells on the top

1921
01:26:20,789 --> 01:26:26,279
portions of the leaf primordia all are a

1922
01:26:23,099 --> 01:26:27,779
lot thinner and appearance this tells me

1923
01:26:26,279 --> 01:26:30,059
that the blade sheath boundaries

1924
01:26:27,779 --> 01:26:32,039
probably formed during plastic on four

1925
01:26:30,060 --> 01:26:36,090
and gives us more insight on where to

1926
01:26:32,039 --> 01:26:38,340
look at during development a very

1927
01:26:36,090 --> 01:26:40,650
exciting thing that happened while I was

1928
01:26:38,340 --> 01:26:42,900
working on this project is the recent

1929
01:26:40,649 --> 01:26:45,569
publication of the kind of clone genome

1930
01:26:42,899 --> 01:26:47,488
which gave me the ability to use more

1931
01:26:45,569 --> 01:26:50,609
molecular techniques to approach the

1932
01:26:47,488 --> 01:26:53,879
problem so the first thing I wanted to

1933
01:26:50,609 --> 01:26:57,598
ask is that whether or not known genes

1934
01:26:53,880 --> 01:26:59,310
involved in Lydia love formation in same

1935
01:26:57,599 --> 01:27:01,529
a species whether or not their

1936
01:26:59,310 --> 01:27:04,079
expression patterns are matched with any

1937
01:27:01,529 --> 01:27:06,269
kind of closed species so here I have an

1938
01:27:04,078 --> 01:27:08,549
in situ hybridization of the gene that I

1939
01:27:06,270 --> 01:27:11,420
talked about Lydia Swan and here I just

1940
01:27:08,550 --> 01:27:16,020
want to bring your attention to asbestos

1941
01:27:11,420 --> 01:27:18,539
the specificity of when and where this

1942
01:27:16,020 --> 01:27:21,630
gene expressed so for in situ

1943
01:27:18,539 --> 01:27:25,019
hybridization wherever you have this

1944
01:27:21,630 --> 01:27:26,789
little colours lighting up that

1945
01:27:25,020 --> 01:27:29,099
signifies that the gene X is expressed

1946
01:27:26,789 --> 01:27:32,340
at that particular tissue at that

1947
01:27:29,099 --> 01:27:34,949
particular stage in development so to do

1948
01:27:32,340 --> 01:27:37,590
that what I did is I took known protein

1949
01:27:34,948 --> 01:27:39,689
sequences that are in maize and did some

1950
01:27:37,590 --> 01:27:41,489
simple bioinformatics in this case I did

1951
01:27:39,689 --> 01:27:42,269
a two blast and search to try to

1952
01:27:41,488 --> 01:27:44,488
identify

1953
01:27:42,270 --> 01:27:46,530
orthologues in a kind of clover that

1954
01:27:44,488 --> 01:27:50,009
might correspond to in this case the

1955
01:27:46,529 --> 01:27:51,899
Legolas one gene and then a

1956
01:27:50,010 --> 01:27:55,020
correspondingly I fished out their

1957
01:27:51,899 --> 01:27:56,429
sequences using a genome browser so

1958
01:27:55,020 --> 01:27:58,619
afterwards what I can do is I can

1959
01:27:56,429 --> 01:28:00,389
construct a gene tree that tells me

1960
01:27:58,618 --> 01:28:02,009
whether or not these genes are indeed

1961
01:28:00,389 --> 01:28:05,489
true orthologs

1962
01:28:02,010 --> 01:28:07,679
so here I have the genes fished out from

1963
01:28:05,488 --> 01:28:11,459
the kind of clawed genus and then

1964
01:28:07,679 --> 01:28:12,118
compared to citerior maize rice and as

1965
01:28:11,460 --> 01:28:13,800
an out-group

1966
01:28:12,118 --> 01:28:16,948
I used a parallel

1967
01:28:13,800 --> 01:28:19,260
that is present in maze here we can see

1968
01:28:16,948 --> 01:28:21,210
that they fostered together in a clade

1969
01:28:19,260 --> 01:28:25,619
signifying that I indeed have an

1970
01:28:21,210 --> 01:28:27,420
ortholog of Regulus 1 protein and also

1971
01:28:25,618 --> 01:28:28,889
we can see here that the genes are

1972
01:28:27,420 --> 01:28:30,899
duplicated which isn't surprising

1973
01:28:28,889 --> 01:28:33,960
because we know that it kind of Claude

1974
01:28:30,899 --> 01:28:38,129
gene oh yeah the genus of many kind of

1975
01:28:33,960 --> 01:28:41,309
clone species are actually hexaploid so

1976
01:28:38,130 --> 01:28:43,078
the main a pipeline in which I'm going

1977
01:28:41,309 --> 01:28:45,420
to figure out whether or not these genes

1978
01:28:43,078 --> 01:28:47,639
are expressed is first by using these

1979
01:28:45,420 --> 01:28:50,730
candidate genes I'm going to do rt-pcr

1980
01:28:47,639 --> 01:28:53,520
to see if they are expressed in the shoe

1981
01:28:50,729 --> 01:28:55,618
tips if they are expressed then I can

1982
01:28:53,520 --> 01:28:58,170
ask the question on whether or not they

1983
01:28:55,618 --> 01:29:00,420
are expressed at the correct time and at

1984
01:28:58,170 --> 01:29:04,349
the correct location so by that I'm

1985
01:29:00,420 --> 01:29:06,359
going to use in situ hybridization so

1986
01:29:04,349 --> 01:29:08,460
here are some preliminary data on what

1987
01:29:06,359 --> 01:29:10,948
legalists one looks like any kind of

1988
01:29:08,460 --> 01:29:13,408
clone plants so here I have two alleles

1989
01:29:10,948 --> 01:29:18,779
of legal asjuan in which I term Legolas

1990
01:29:13,408 --> 01:29:22,198
1-1 and Legolas 1-2 we can see that 4-1

1991
01:29:18,779 --> 01:29:24,359
we have we can amplify using PCR from

1992
01:29:22,198 --> 01:29:26,399
genomic DNA and that tells us that the

1993
01:29:24,359 --> 01:29:29,269
gene isn't back there when you reuse

1994
01:29:26,399 --> 01:29:32,509
cDNA we can see very faint expression

1995
01:29:29,270 --> 01:29:35,790
signifying that the gene is indeed

1996
01:29:32,510 --> 01:29:39,750
expressed and it kind of closes shoe

1997
01:29:35,789 --> 01:29:42,750
tips we compare that to the Lille number

1998
01:29:39,750 --> 01:29:45,300
2 where we get amplification in the

1999
01:29:42,750 --> 01:29:47,760
genome yet we do not have any expression

2000
01:29:45,300 --> 01:29:51,659
which signifies that that allele is not

2001
01:29:47,760 --> 01:29:54,389
being expressed um further on I would

2002
01:29:51,658 --> 01:29:56,279
like to do some in situ hybridization on

2003
01:29:54,389 --> 01:29:58,710
this specific gene to see if they're

2004
01:29:56,279 --> 01:30:03,920
expressed correctly in the right time

2005
01:29:58,710 --> 01:30:06,179
and location so that's to be determined

2006
01:30:03,920 --> 01:30:10,230
so one other thing that I was really

2007
01:30:06,179 --> 01:30:12,480
curious about is that the fact that the

2008
01:30:10,229 --> 01:30:15,658
this particular phenotype is only

2009
01:30:12,479 --> 01:30:17,729
present in it kind of clawed genus so

2010
01:30:15,658 --> 01:30:19,649
signifies that there might be novel

2011
01:30:17,729 --> 01:30:25,078
genetic elements that are in the kind of

2012
01:30:19,649 --> 01:30:27,599
OG to do that I designed an interesting

2013
01:30:25,078 --> 01:30:29,969
system in which I can compare

2014
01:30:27,600 --> 01:30:33,539
um what factors are in charge of making

2015
01:30:29,970 --> 01:30:35,820
a little so here I want to compare and

2016
01:30:33,539 --> 01:30:37,489
you kind of close species that doesn't

2017
01:30:35,819 --> 01:30:39,750
have a leg you and compare it to a

2018
01:30:37,489 --> 01:30:42,359
relative that does have a leg you will

2019
01:30:39,750 --> 01:30:42,869
signified here by these little hairy elk

2020
01:30:42,359 --> 01:30:45,869
Grove's

2021
01:30:42,869 --> 01:30:47,309
from the top of the leaf so to do that

2022
01:30:45,869 --> 01:30:50,880
I'm going to utilize a transcriptomics

2023
01:30:47,310 --> 01:30:53,550
approach to look at the differentially

2024
01:30:50,880 --> 01:30:55,859
expressed genes in these two plant

2025
01:30:53,550 --> 01:30:58,289
species and to see if there are any

2026
01:30:55,859 --> 01:31:02,670
specific genes that are correlated with

2027
01:30:58,289 --> 01:31:04,050
the appearance of illegal structure did

2028
01:31:02,670 --> 01:31:06,029
you do this I'm going to use an

2029
01:31:04,050 --> 01:31:08,310
experimental technique called laser

2030
01:31:06,029 --> 01:31:10,920
microdissection in which I can enhance

2031
01:31:08,310 --> 01:31:13,260
the amount of tissue collected in very

2032
01:31:10,920 --> 01:31:16,109
specific locations in this case I will

2033
01:31:13,260 --> 01:31:18,780
take tissue that are present in the

2034
01:31:16,109 --> 01:31:22,170
blade sheath boundary so by doing that

2035
01:31:18,779 --> 01:31:25,199
I'm going to cut out specific regions of

2036
01:31:22,170 --> 01:31:27,449
interest using the micro laser

2037
01:31:25,199 --> 01:31:31,199
microdissection technique and the two

2038
01:31:27,449 --> 01:31:34,710
different species and isolate RNA to do

2039
01:31:31,199 --> 01:31:37,800
an RNA seek so in summary my main

2040
01:31:34,710 --> 01:31:40,350
question of interest is why we have this

2041
01:31:37,800 --> 01:31:42,390
unique phenotype in kind of close

2042
01:31:40,350 --> 01:31:44,850
species in which they don't have a leg

2043
01:31:42,390 --> 01:31:48,360
you'll you have a very nice lady

2044
01:31:44,850 --> 01:31:50,850
boundary to do that I have found out

2045
01:31:48,359 --> 01:31:53,099
that the first instances of blade sheath

2046
01:31:50,850 --> 01:31:56,280
boundary formation are around plastic on

2047
01:31:53,100 --> 01:32:00,090
or and using very simple bioinformatics

2048
01:31:56,279 --> 01:32:03,449
I was able to tell that the genes are in

2049
01:32:00,090 --> 01:32:05,190
the genome and also expressed in the

2050
01:32:03,449 --> 01:32:08,909
shoe embassies however I'm not sure

2051
01:32:05,189 --> 01:32:12,149
about its expression in a specific

2052
01:32:08,909 --> 01:32:15,210
manner and by utilizing RNA seek

2053
01:32:12,149 --> 01:32:17,579
approaches I wish to identify novel gene

2054
01:32:15,210 --> 01:32:20,760
elements that are responsible for

2055
01:32:17,579 --> 01:32:22,140
creating lingual and finally this

2056
01:32:20,760 --> 01:32:24,119
project is funded by the National

2057
01:32:22,140 --> 01:32:26,220
Science Foundation and will be later on

2058
01:32:24,119 --> 01:32:28,529
funded by the dextral undergraduate

2059
01:32:26,220 --> 01:32:31,050
research endowment grant given to me on

2060
01:32:28,529 --> 01:32:33,179
special thanks to Mike Scanlon who has

2061
01:32:31,050 --> 01:32:34,829
handed down the project to me and to

2062
01:32:33,180 --> 01:32:37,320
Josh rainbow who's a postdoc in the lab

2063
01:32:34,829 --> 01:32:40,140
that has given me a lot of mentoring and

2064
01:32:37,319 --> 01:32:41,420
support also thanks to other members in

2065
01:32:40,140 --> 01:32:43,910
the Scanlon lab and

2066
01:32:41,420 --> 01:32:46,190
Jerell Davis who has provided C to me

2067
01:32:43,909 --> 01:32:48,529
and also gave me a little insight on how

2068
01:32:46,189 --> 01:32:50,928
to explore the diversity within the

2069
01:32:48,529 --> 01:32:53,659
grass family and also finally to the

2070
01:32:50,929 --> 01:32:56,600
Cornell Center of Materials Research on

2071
01:32:53,659 --> 01:32:59,090
assisting me on doing SEM experiments

2072
01:32:56,600 --> 01:33:10,400
and by that I'd like to open up to

2073
01:32:59,090 --> 01:33:13,730
further questions thank you so are you

2074
01:33:10,399 --> 01:33:16,219
hypothesizing that the lack of fuel is

2075
01:33:13,729 --> 01:33:20,599
related to polyploid nature and

2076
01:33:16,219 --> 01:33:24,230
conflicts yeah yeah that's one of the

2077
01:33:20,600 --> 01:33:28,489
very interesting hypotheses that I serve

2078
01:33:24,229 --> 01:33:31,159
came up very early on because as I was

2079
01:33:28,488 --> 01:33:34,629
digging up in literature most species in

2080
01:33:31,159 --> 01:33:38,029
the kind of Chloe genus in fact are

2081
01:33:34,630 --> 01:33:41,539
hexaploid or even higher boy D bubbles I

2082
01:33:38,029 --> 01:33:45,050
think the highest one was 52 um and

2083
01:33:41,539 --> 01:33:47,630
that's ubiquitous throughout the genus

2084
01:33:45,050 --> 01:33:50,119
so that might be an indication that

2085
01:33:47,630 --> 01:33:52,300
maybe there are some because the whole

2086
01:33:50,119 --> 01:33:55,340
genome was duplicated and each gene is

2087
01:33:52,300 --> 01:33:57,440
represented in three times as much

2088
01:33:55,340 --> 01:34:00,699
depandi maybe there's some interesting

2089
01:33:57,439 --> 01:34:03,349
we're Navajo gene interaction that is

2090
01:34:00,698 --> 01:34:05,059
plays a defect of creating this unique

2091
01:34:03,350 --> 01:34:07,280
phenotype another really interesting

2092
01:34:05,060 --> 01:34:10,100
observation as I was looking at it is

2093
01:34:07,279 --> 01:34:11,809
that the species that do have alig

2094
01:34:10,100 --> 01:34:13,910
you'll they tend to be perennial in

2095
01:34:11,810 --> 01:34:16,489
nature so maybe that too signifies

2096
01:34:13,909 --> 01:34:20,000
something about how this unique

2097
01:34:16,488 --> 01:34:22,459
phenotype arises but I don't haven't

2098
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:25,640
found a very good way to test that

2099
01:34:22,460 --> 01:34:28,369
hypothesis of polyploid in terms of

2100
01:34:25,640 --> 01:34:32,030
creating this phenotype yet but that's

2101
01:34:28,369 --> 01:34:35,800
one of the possibilities other questions

2102
01:34:32,029 --> 01:34:35,800
for our poster break

2103
01:34:39,189 --> 01:34:41,250
you

2104
01:34:44,770 --> 01:34:50,270
the second half of our program today

2105
01:34:47,469 --> 01:34:53,810
we're mixing things up a bit

2106
01:34:50,270 --> 01:34:56,960
Patricia Chan is going first and then

2107
01:34:53,810 --> 01:34:58,960
we'll start back with been after patty

2108
01:34:56,960 --> 01:35:03,469
so patty we'll be talking today about

2109
01:34:58,960 --> 01:35:06,619
the LHB conservatory the green jewel of

2110
01:35:03,469 --> 01:35:09,439
campus we are the whole class loved the

2111
01:35:06,619 --> 01:35:11,210
title thank you Chris

2112
01:35:09,439 --> 01:35:12,439
my name is Patricia Chan it is my

2113
01:35:11,210 --> 01:35:14,420
pleasure to present to you today about

2114
01:35:12,439 --> 01:35:16,669
my involvement in the Liberty hi Bailey

2115
01:35:14,420 --> 01:35:18,710
conservatory or as Chris said the green

2116
01:35:16,670 --> 01:35:20,510
jewel of campus I've been working with

2117
01:35:18,710 --> 01:35:23,060
the conservatory in the past few years

2118
01:35:20,510 --> 01:35:24,289
since my matriculation in 2015 so I'd

2119
01:35:23,060 --> 01:35:26,510
like to tell you a little bit about its

2120
01:35:24,289 --> 01:35:28,698
backgrounds and about how its progressed

2121
01:35:26,510 --> 01:35:31,100
over these years a little bit on the

2122
01:35:28,698 --> 01:35:33,259
history of the conservatories on campus

2123
01:35:31,100 --> 01:35:35,539
the Liberty High bailey conservatory was

2124
01:35:33,260 --> 01:35:38,869
not a first exhibition green house at

2125
01:35:35,539 --> 01:35:42,350
Cornell the Sage conservatory circa 1882

2126
01:35:38,869 --> 01:35:44,119
to 1923 pictured above over here and it

2127
01:35:42,350 --> 01:35:46,699
is round where sage Hall is today

2128
01:35:44,119 --> 01:35:48,890
Liberty High bailey himself was a

2129
01:35:46,698 --> 01:35:50,809
renowned botanist and horticulturalists

2130
01:35:48,890 --> 01:35:52,760
he had great involvement in the founding

2131
01:35:50,810 --> 01:35:54,380
of the 4-h organization and was the

2132
01:35:52,760 --> 01:35:56,869
first Dean of the College of Agriculture

2133
01:35:54,380 --> 01:35:58,640
which is now known as house he founded

2134
01:35:56,869 --> 01:36:00,679
the Liberty High bailey heart aureum

2135
01:35:58,640 --> 01:36:02,900
which includes Cornell's plant Anatomy

2136
01:36:00,679 --> 01:36:04,369
collection or a barium and our

2137
01:36:02,899 --> 01:36:06,439
conservatory he believed that

2138
01:36:04,369 --> 01:36:07,908
greenhouses were vital to the college's

2139
01:36:06,439 --> 01:36:09,619
mission and he had visions of

2140
01:36:07,908 --> 01:36:11,569
incorporating living plant collections

2141
01:36:09,619 --> 01:36:13,609
into the teaching of botany he is

2142
01:36:11,569 --> 01:36:16,819
pictured below the state conservatory

2143
01:36:13,609 --> 01:36:19,698
over here the first lhp conservatory was

2144
01:36:16,819 --> 01:36:21,920
built in 1931 is a classical Lorden

2145
01:36:19,698 --> 01:36:24,169
Burnham style greenhouse however due to

2146
01:36:21,920 --> 01:36:26,719
compromised structures it was taken down

2147
01:36:24,170 --> 01:36:29,000
in 2010 a much to the thanks in support

2148
01:36:26,719 --> 01:36:30,560
of the sips community and cows the

2149
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:33,760
current conservatory was built recently

2150
01:36:30,560 --> 01:36:36,320
and open to the public in 2016 and

2151
01:36:33,760 --> 01:36:38,810
here's an image of the original lhp

2152
01:36:36,319 --> 01:36:41,000
conservatory in the palm house and for

2153
01:36:38,810 --> 01:36:44,570
comparison this is our greenhouse today

2154
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:46,100
in the student house now there are a lot

2155
01:36:44,569 --> 01:36:47,960
of advantages of being housed in our

2156
01:36:46,100 --> 01:36:49,010
modern greenhouse which allows us the

2157
01:36:47,960 --> 01:36:51,679
use of state-of-the-art technology

2158
01:36:49,010 --> 01:36:53,600
through our plants we have precise light

2159
01:36:51,679 --> 01:36:55,810
humidity and heat regulation using our

2160
01:36:53,600 --> 01:36:57,700
argot system the top over here

2161
01:36:55,810 --> 01:36:59,320
into the Argos boxes which are scattered

2162
01:36:57,699 --> 01:37:00,760
throughout the greenhouse which

2163
01:36:59,319 --> 01:37:02,259
constantly take measurements of the

2164
01:37:00,760 --> 01:37:04,780
light and humidity and then the

2165
01:37:02,260 --> 01:37:07,090
automatic system of shades lights events

2166
01:37:04,779 --> 01:37:09,399
fans and fog will adjust these in

2167
01:37:07,090 --> 01:37:11,380
real-time we have numerous irrigation

2168
01:37:09,399 --> 01:37:13,599
options including reverse osmosis water

2169
01:37:11,380 --> 01:37:14,650
tempered water and fertilize water to

2170
01:37:13,600 --> 01:37:17,440
cater to the needs of our diverse

2171
01:37:14,649 --> 01:37:19,420
collection as well as four feet deep of

2172
01:37:17,439 --> 01:37:23,139
a custom growing medium in our palm

2173
01:37:19,420 --> 01:37:25,510
house for a large trees all of these

2174
01:37:23,140 --> 01:37:27,010
factors together allows us to grow pence

2175
01:37:25,510 --> 01:37:28,720
for many different climates including

2176
01:37:27,010 --> 01:37:32,680
those originating from desert temperate

2177
01:37:28,720 --> 01:37:34,539
regions peat bogs or aquatic areas now

2178
01:37:32,680 --> 01:37:37,270
why do we have the conservatory for the

2179
01:37:34,539 --> 01:37:39,699
first place well it serves our uses as a

2180
01:37:37,270 --> 01:37:41,620
living museum for one it's an attraction

2181
01:37:39,699 --> 01:37:43,809
for artists and photographers from all

2182
01:37:41,619 --> 01:37:45,849
around to come here for inspiration and

2183
01:37:43,810 --> 01:37:48,220
it's an oasis for students and faculty

2184
01:37:45,850 --> 01:37:50,470
here during ethnic as long and arduous

2185
01:37:48,220 --> 01:37:52,630
winters especially this year it's the

2186
01:37:50,470 --> 01:37:54,730
home of the titan arum switch I'm sure

2187
01:37:52,630 --> 01:37:55,569
you've heard of we stinky and Corolla

2188
01:37:54,729 --> 01:37:57,579
switch will talk a little bit about

2189
01:37:55,569 --> 01:38:00,340
later and you play a role in preserving

2190
01:37:57,579 --> 01:38:02,109
rare and unusual species by sharing

2191
01:38:00,340 --> 01:38:04,060
seeds cuttings and Papa culés with other

2192
01:38:02,109 --> 01:38:06,460
academic institutions now most

2193
01:38:04,060 --> 01:38:09,100
importantly to us the conservatories of

2194
01:38:06,460 --> 01:38:10,359
versatile educational tool material from

2195
01:38:09,100 --> 01:38:12,789
the conservatory is used to teach

2196
01:38:10,359 --> 01:38:15,039
classes and many groups of students and

2197
01:38:12,789 --> 01:38:17,769
others come through and tour regularly

2198
01:38:15,039 --> 01:38:19,569
the material from the screen house is

2199
01:38:17,770 --> 01:38:22,570
used to teach classes such as plant

2200
01:38:19,569 --> 01:38:24,699
biodiversity systematics paleo botany

2201
01:38:22,569 --> 01:38:26,679
chemical ecology and even classes like

2202
01:38:24,699 --> 01:38:30,010
botanical illustration and as a quick

2203
01:38:26,680 --> 01:38:33,100
aside to that point here's some examples

2204
01:38:30,010 --> 01:38:35,079
of artworks done by myself and my fellow

2205
01:38:33,100 --> 01:38:37,420
students and our botanical illustration

2206
01:38:35,079 --> 01:38:40,750
classes from subjects that we saw in the

2207
01:38:37,420 --> 01:38:42,520
conservatory now during this talk I'll

2208
01:38:40,750 --> 01:38:45,609
be cutting a little bit about our recent

2209
01:38:42,520 --> 01:38:47,470
projects in continuing to showcase our

2210
01:38:45,609 --> 01:38:50,009
biodiversity fortify our collections

2211
01:38:47,470 --> 01:38:52,930
database and installing an inground Hans

2212
01:38:50,010 --> 01:38:55,710
first off biodiversity as we can't have

2213
01:38:52,930 --> 01:38:59,920
a greenhouse without plants inside of it

2214
01:38:55,710 --> 01:39:02,680
this picture was taken in 2015 during

2215
01:38:59,920 --> 01:39:04,630
the reestablishment of the conservatory

2216
01:39:02,680 --> 01:39:06,970
in our new greenhouse so we've got a

2217
01:39:04,630 --> 01:39:09,190
Melissa Lynn Bruckner and Chad Thomas

2218
01:39:06,970 --> 01:39:10,989
we're a greenhouse workers that

2219
01:39:09,189 --> 01:39:15,329
transporting these comically large

2220
01:39:10,988 --> 01:39:18,069
cycads in through this much smaller door

2221
01:39:15,329 --> 01:39:19,809
our conservatory of both great

2222
01:39:18,069 --> 01:39:21,488
biodiversity and we're always trying to

2223
01:39:19,810 --> 01:39:24,280
improve on it currently we have about

2224
01:39:21,488 --> 01:39:27,129
150 families an inner database we have

2225
01:39:24,279 --> 01:39:29,529
over 750 unique specimens accessions

2226
01:39:27,130 --> 01:39:31,569
some of the most well represented

2227
01:39:29,529 --> 01:39:34,000
families that we have our Castle 8c I

2228
01:39:31,569 --> 01:39:37,569
know it is a succulent orchid a sea

2229
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:40,448
orchids cactus II cacti and airy see

2230
01:39:37,569 --> 01:39:43,329
Aaron's a little bit more about this

2231
01:39:40,448 --> 01:39:46,149
photo in the corner here is this photo

2232
01:39:43,329 --> 01:39:48,039
is Amorphophallus long so coolly I which

2233
01:39:46,149 --> 01:39:51,159
is the smallest member of the genus

2234
01:39:48,039 --> 01:39:53,500
Amorphophallus for reference in the

2235
01:39:51,159 --> 01:39:55,448
background here is the patio of its

2236
01:39:53,500 --> 01:39:57,420
cousin the largest member of

2237
01:39:55,448 --> 01:40:00,460
Amorphophallus Amorphophallus titanum

2238
01:39:57,420 --> 01:40:04,119
it's one of the italian arabs that is

2239
01:40:00,460 --> 01:40:06,189
just the petiole of one single leaf so

2240
01:40:04,119 --> 01:40:09,819
we've got we sing key and Curless which

2241
01:40:06,189 --> 01:40:11,738
are two adult blooming sized italian

2242
01:40:09,819 --> 01:40:13,119
arabs and people travel from all over

2243
01:40:11,738 --> 01:40:15,279
the country in order to Whitney's

2244
01:40:13,119 --> 01:40:16,809
witness these plants which over the

2245
01:40:15,279 --> 01:40:19,779
course of several days produces

2246
01:40:16,810 --> 01:40:22,180
stunningly large inflorescence with a

2247
01:40:19,779 --> 01:40:24,488
scent akin to rotting meat over the year

2248
01:40:22,180 --> 01:40:27,310
students and faculty have taken seed and

2249
01:40:24,488 --> 01:40:29,500
data describing volatile emissions of

2250
01:40:27,310 --> 01:40:31,330
these plants in the backgrounds of we

2251
01:40:29,500 --> 01:40:33,789
stinky here you may be able to discern

2252
01:40:31,329 --> 01:40:36,670
the vegetative state of cruelest and

2253
01:40:33,789 --> 01:40:39,399
here's Troilus in bloom who is actually

2254
01:40:36,670 --> 01:40:41,350
our first Titan to have blooming outside

2255
01:40:39,399 --> 01:40:44,079
in men's gardens you might also be able

2256
01:40:41,350 --> 01:40:47,260
to see this fishing line a descending

2257
01:40:44,079 --> 01:40:48,640
down into the state as we place a sticky

2258
01:40:47,260 --> 01:40:50,860
insect trap in order to check for

2259
01:40:48,640 --> 01:40:55,690
pollinators this is a Samantha Schultz

2260
01:40:50,859 --> 01:40:58,479
and I read this an audience here so we

2261
01:40:55,689 --> 01:41:00,488
have our database which serves to inform

2262
01:40:58,479 --> 01:41:03,899
the general public as well as people of

2263
01:41:00,488 --> 01:41:05,799
the curatorial and horticultural staff

2264
01:41:03,899 --> 01:41:07,929
accessible to the public we have

2265
01:41:05,800 --> 01:41:10,900
information like the taxonomy of the

2266
01:41:07,930 --> 01:41:13,000
plant including Latin name family common

2267
01:41:10,899 --> 01:41:15,488
name geography of where plants are

2268
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:17,500
native to an additional historical and

2269
01:41:15,488 --> 01:41:20,019
ethnographic all information we also

2270
01:41:17,500 --> 01:41:21,609
have myriad of photos of these plants in

2271
01:41:20,020 --> 01:41:23,380
different stages and

2272
01:41:21,609 --> 01:41:26,099
supplemental info in the form of videos

2273
01:41:23,380 --> 01:41:29,409
or links to additional websites

2274
01:41:26,100 --> 01:41:31,300
accessible to the curators and to the

2275
01:41:29,409 --> 01:41:33,309
horticultural staff we have information

2276
01:41:31,300 --> 01:41:35,829
like the present location of the plants

2277
01:41:33,310 --> 01:41:37,450
and flowering times in collecting flower

2278
01:41:35,829 --> 01:41:39,399
and times are starting to reveal trends

2279
01:41:37,449 --> 01:41:40,720
that can help professors coordinate

2280
01:41:39,399 --> 01:41:43,089
their lesson plans with the blooms in

2281
01:41:40,720 --> 01:41:44,980
the conservatory over here we have an

2282
01:41:43,090 --> 01:41:46,480
example of one of the pages that would

2283
01:41:44,979 --> 01:41:49,299
be brought up if you scanned one of the

2284
01:41:46,479 --> 01:41:50,619
QR codes in the conservatory to bring

2285
01:41:49,300 --> 01:41:55,239
more information about this aerosol

2286
01:41:50,619 --> 01:41:58,029
okiya this is alumnus Nick Linus and I

2287
01:41:55,239 --> 01:42:00,429
taking down data in order to input in

2288
01:41:58,029 --> 01:42:04,179
the database and if you see over here

2289
01:42:00,430 --> 01:42:05,920
and here our examples of QR codes puts

2290
01:42:04,180 --> 01:42:07,360
it on the place where you can scan them

2291
01:42:05,920 --> 01:42:10,180
with your mobile device to bring up

2292
01:42:07,359 --> 01:42:12,009
information in the greenhouse now we

2293
01:42:10,180 --> 01:42:13,750
have several efforts in order to best

2294
01:42:12,010 --> 01:42:15,670
showcase our collections to the public

2295
01:42:13,750 --> 01:42:18,430
to disperse information and make

2296
01:42:15,670 --> 01:42:20,529
everything more accessible we have for

2297
01:42:18,430 --> 01:42:23,050
one organized our plants into

2298
01:42:20,529 --> 01:42:24,939
collections series of educational themes

2299
01:42:23,050 --> 01:42:27,460
such as convergence or the separate

2300
01:42:24,939 --> 01:42:30,909
evolution of similar traits for example

2301
01:42:27,460 --> 01:42:32,529
succulents karna pari are criticized and

2302
01:42:30,909 --> 01:42:34,359
we have an evolutionary sequence that

2303
01:42:32,529 --> 01:42:37,300
goes from bryophytes through Torretta

2304
01:42:34,359 --> 01:42:38,380
fights gymnosperms and angiosperms that

2305
01:42:37,300 --> 01:42:40,690
goes to the center aisle of the

2306
01:42:38,380 --> 01:42:44,560
conservatory as i mentioned before we

2307
01:42:40,689 --> 01:42:46,269
have QR codes on about 119 plants in the

2308
01:42:44,560 --> 01:42:48,220
conservatory where you can access

2309
01:42:46,270 --> 01:42:49,990
information with your phone and craig

2310
01:42:48,220 --> 01:42:52,210
kramer runs the conservatory blog which

2311
01:42:49,989 --> 01:42:55,329
features plants and current events for

2312
01:42:52,210 --> 01:42:56,800
everyone to find online lastly i'll be

2313
01:42:55,329 --> 01:42:59,550
talking a little bit about the pond in

2314
01:42:56,800 --> 01:43:03,539
the conservatory this is a project that

2315
01:42:59,550 --> 01:43:06,130
I was involved in in the summer of 2016

2316
01:43:03,539 --> 01:43:07,300
where I worked really closely with kevin

2317
01:43:06,130 --> 01:43:08,859
nixon and paul cooper and other

2318
01:43:07,300 --> 01:43:11,680
greenhouse staff in order to install

2319
01:43:08,859 --> 01:43:13,839
this in order for us to have a venue to

2320
01:43:11,680 --> 01:43:15,760
display our aquatic plants a little bit

2321
01:43:13,840 --> 01:43:17,560
about this pond it's approximately eight

2322
01:43:15,760 --> 01:43:19,360
feet long and three feet deep at its

2323
01:43:17,560 --> 01:43:22,150
deepest point it's got like a wooden

2324
01:43:19,359 --> 01:43:25,449
shelving in strips infrastructure in

2325
01:43:22,149 --> 01:43:27,429
order to display tons of different sizes

2326
01:43:25,449 --> 01:43:29,380
it runs fertilized water which is

2327
01:43:27,430 --> 01:43:32,050
recycled via the waterfall that's

2328
01:43:29,380 --> 01:43:33,609
located in the corner over here and it's

2329
01:43:32,050 --> 01:43:35,020
lined with coconut coir which can be

2330
01:43:33,609 --> 01:43:38,259
used as a substrate for

2331
01:43:35,020 --> 01:43:40,090
aquatic plants the perimeter is kept

2332
01:43:38,260 --> 01:43:43,239
usually very moist so it's very suitable

2333
01:43:40,090 --> 01:43:46,960
for moisture living plants speaking of

2334
01:43:43,239 --> 01:43:49,630
which this pond allows us to grow plants

2335
01:43:46,960 --> 01:43:52,779
such as our coniferous plants our

2336
01:43:49,630 --> 01:43:57,130
tropical and temperate picture plants

2337
01:43:52,779 --> 01:43:59,159
are sarracenia and Nepenthes we have

2338
01:43:57,130 --> 01:44:01,270
aquatic ferns like Marcy Liana Zola

2339
01:43:59,159 --> 01:44:03,639
bryophytes such as moss and liverworts

2340
01:44:01,270 --> 01:44:06,430
and our Victoria water lily pictured

2341
01:44:03,640 --> 01:44:08,380
over here it's got this stunning blossom

2342
01:44:06,430 --> 01:44:11,409
that goes over the course of two days

2343
01:44:08,380 --> 01:44:13,119
with the beetle pollinated strategy over

2344
01:44:11,409 --> 01:44:15,010
here is me handling the Victoria water

2345
01:44:13,119 --> 01:44:18,880
lily as you can see the pods grow up to

2346
01:44:15,010 --> 01:44:20,530
three feet in diameter ongoing projects

2347
01:44:18,880 --> 01:44:22,720
in the conservatory include installing a

2348
01:44:20,529 --> 01:44:26,229
central trunk in the palm house working

2349
01:44:22,720 --> 01:44:27,909
on getting a fake tree using a robinia

2350
01:44:26,229 --> 01:44:30,129
bark in order to host epiphytes an

2351
01:44:27,909 --> 01:44:32,109
inground succulent and cacti garden and

2352
01:44:30,130 --> 01:44:34,300
of course a continued expansion of plant

2353
01:44:32,109 --> 01:44:37,389
collections and database information to

2354
01:44:34,300 --> 01:44:39,550
increase accessibility I'd like to

2355
01:44:37,390 --> 01:44:41,260
acknowledge Kevin Nixon my advisor in

2356
01:44:39,550 --> 01:44:43,239
the curator Liberty hi Bailey

2357
01:44:41,260 --> 01:44:44,530
conservatory Paul Cooper and the other

2358
01:44:43,239 --> 01:44:46,090
greenhouse staff for keeping these

2359
01:44:44,529 --> 01:44:50,619
plants alive and raising them so well

2360
01:44:46,090 --> 01:44:53,680
Craig Cramer who fastidiously documented

2361
01:44:50,619 --> 01:44:55,840
this via his photography and addcom hulu

2362
01:44:53,680 --> 01:44:59,560
sedated information on the previous

2363
01:44:55,840 --> 01:45:00,520
greenhouses on campus and lastly I'd

2364
01:44:59,560 --> 01:45:02,020
like to thank you all for being here

2365
01:45:00,520 --> 01:45:03,430
today I knew this presentation piqued

2366
01:45:02,020 --> 01:45:05,260
your interest consider visiting the

2367
01:45:03,430 --> 01:45:07,510
conservatory which is open on weekdays

2368
01:45:05,260 --> 01:45:14,770
from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. and I'd like to

2369
01:45:07,510 --> 01:45:19,030
open the floor to questions questions

2370
01:45:14,770 --> 01:45:20,440
from floor to Penny what new species

2371
01:45:19,029 --> 01:45:22,179
would you like to see at it if you were

2372
01:45:20,439 --> 01:45:24,339
like the curator and you wanted a that's

2373
01:45:22,180 --> 01:45:26,619
it what's your dream plants that you

2374
01:45:24,340 --> 01:45:29,230
like to have that is a really great

2375
01:45:26,619 --> 01:45:31,510
question there's so many that I can't

2376
01:45:29,229 --> 01:45:33,159
even begin to think of just a few names

2377
01:45:31,510 --> 01:45:35,260
but I would really like to see a lot

2378
01:45:33,159 --> 01:45:36,819
more families being represented even

2379
01:45:35,260 --> 01:45:37,960
more orders we have some really

2380
01:45:36,819 --> 01:45:39,340
interesting fence that I don't think are

2381
01:45:37,960 --> 01:45:41,050
advertised very well such as their

2382
01:45:39,340 --> 01:45:43,960
umbrellas which play a really

2383
01:45:41,050 --> 01:45:46,180
interesting role in the placement of

2384
01:45:43,960 --> 01:45:48,289
basal angiosperms and I'd like to see

2385
01:45:46,180 --> 01:45:50,150
more plants that are not necessarily

2386
01:45:48,289 --> 01:45:56,649
large and showy but play maybe a

2387
01:45:50,149 --> 01:45:56,649
historical importance other questions

2388
01:45:56,739 --> 01:46:04,618
thanks patty

2389
01:45:59,020 --> 01:46:04,619
[Applause]

2390
01:46:07,538 --> 01:46:13,389
our next speaker is Ven sword Ben

2391
01:46:10,958 --> 01:46:16,559
in addition to being a Plant Sciences

2392
01:46:13,389 --> 01:46:19,659
major is the chief Botanical officer at

2393
01:46:16,559 --> 01:46:22,479
ecosystems and today he'll be talking

2394
01:46:19,658 --> 01:46:27,908
about charged zeolite as a hydroponic

2395
01:46:22,479 --> 01:46:29,590
growth medium Ben thank you Chris so as

2396
01:46:27,908 --> 01:46:31,628
Chris mentioned I'm a plant science

2397
01:46:29,590 --> 01:46:35,729
major concentrating in breeding in

2398
01:46:31,628 --> 01:46:37,868
genetics but most of my research and

2399
01:46:35,729 --> 01:46:39,639
extracurricular interests is in

2400
01:46:37,868 --> 01:46:42,398
hydroponics and so I've been working

2401
01:46:39,639 --> 01:46:45,069
closely with Neil Matson on a lot of the

2402
01:46:42,399 --> 01:46:48,449
research here and so today I'll be

2403
01:46:45,069 --> 01:46:51,878
talking about zeolite as an alternative

2404
01:46:48,448 --> 01:46:54,009
hydroponic growth media so the current

2405
01:46:51,878 --> 01:46:57,819
problem with hydroponics is that

2406
01:46:54,010 --> 01:47:01,208
rockwool is mainly used for starting

2407
01:46:57,819 --> 01:47:02,378
seeds and transplanting into along the

2408
01:47:01,208 --> 01:47:05,198
growth of plants

2409
01:47:02,378 --> 01:47:08,378
the problem with rockwool is that it

2410
01:47:05,198 --> 01:47:11,198
starts with its inception and how it's

2411
01:47:08,378 --> 01:47:15,248
made so it was originally used as

2412
01:47:11,198 --> 01:47:18,518
insulation material and basically what

2413
01:47:15,248 --> 01:47:20,948
rockwell is is a rock that's been melted

2414
01:47:18,519 --> 01:47:23,349
down and then spun like cotton candy in

2415
01:47:20,948 --> 01:47:28,268
order to make this insulation fiber

2416
01:47:23,349 --> 01:47:30,159
material and another issue with it is

2417
01:47:28,269 --> 01:47:33,369
that it's a non biodegradable and non

2418
01:47:30,158 --> 01:47:36,518
reusable so that when the growers are

2419
01:47:33,368 --> 01:47:38,828
done with their one round of cycle with

2420
01:47:36,519 --> 01:47:41,409
these plants they have to throw out the

2421
01:47:38,828 --> 01:47:43,840
rockwool and start with none with new

2422
01:47:41,408 --> 01:47:47,948
ones and that just sits in a landfill

2423
01:47:43,840 --> 01:47:50,409
and doesn't we'll never biodegrade and

2424
01:47:47,948 --> 01:47:52,319
the last issue with rock wool is that it

2425
01:47:50,408 --> 01:47:56,109
has a very low cation exchange capacity

2426
01:47:52,319 --> 01:47:59,378
making it very inert and cation exchange

2427
01:47:56,109 --> 01:48:01,958
capacity is the materials ability to

2428
01:47:59,378 --> 01:48:04,389
hold on to fertilizer and other ions

2429
01:48:01,958 --> 01:48:08,679
that the plant needs throughout its

2430
01:48:04,389 --> 01:48:11,469
growth cycle so the alternative that I

2431
01:48:08,679 --> 01:48:14,559
found for rock wool is called zeolite

2432
01:48:11,469 --> 01:48:17,349
it's a rock that has a honeycomb-like

2433
01:48:14,559 --> 01:48:19,940
structure which allows it to be to have

2434
01:48:17,349 --> 01:48:23,090
a high cation exchange capacity

2435
01:48:19,939 --> 01:48:27,829
making it able to hold on to those ions

2436
01:48:23,090 --> 01:48:30,920
and it's the structure of of it is this

2437
01:48:27,829 --> 01:48:32,869
beta cage which creates the actual

2438
01:48:30,920 --> 01:48:35,449
structure of the rock and then the alpha

2439
01:48:32,869 --> 01:48:39,619
cage which is inside where the ions are

2440
01:48:35,449 --> 01:48:41,539
stored and so along with this high CEC

2441
01:48:39,619 --> 01:48:44,390
it provides structural support for the

2442
01:48:41,539 --> 01:48:46,569
plants it has a water and air holding

2443
01:48:44,390 --> 01:48:52,100
capacity that which is similar to

2444
01:48:46,569 --> 01:48:56,799
potting mix and it is able to buffer the

2445
01:48:52,100 --> 01:48:59,900
pH of the solution because of that CDC

2446
01:48:56,800 --> 01:49:03,860
it's the way that I found this media was

2447
01:48:59,899 --> 01:49:06,409
through NASA research that NASA did with

2448
01:49:03,859 --> 01:49:08,139
a few different types of zeolite and in

2449
01:49:06,409 --> 01:49:11,090
their synthetic substrate they used

2450
01:49:08,140 --> 01:49:12,710
these three media's here which are

2451
01:49:11,090 --> 01:49:16,250
designed it was designed in a specific

2452
01:49:12,710 --> 01:49:19,130
way so that the the nutrients in those

2453
01:49:16,250 --> 01:49:20,689
three types of zeolite were slowly

2454
01:49:19,130 --> 01:49:25,239
released over the course of the growth

2455
01:49:20,689 --> 01:49:28,849
cycle of the plant and then able to have

2456
01:49:25,239 --> 01:49:31,519
effective yields so this was one of

2457
01:49:28,850 --> 01:49:34,160
their trials that they did and with

2458
01:49:31,520 --> 01:49:36,130
carrots and this these are over

2459
01:49:34,159 --> 01:49:38,449
generations if we're using the media

2460
01:49:36,130 --> 01:49:40,909
taking out the old organic matter

2461
01:49:38,449 --> 01:49:43,279
sterilizing it and then reusing it and

2462
01:49:40,909 --> 01:49:47,180
so as you can see the first round of

2463
01:49:43,279 --> 01:49:49,609
carrots was pretty normal but then as

2464
01:49:47,180 --> 01:49:52,070
they started continually growing in the

2465
01:49:49,609 --> 01:49:56,359
zeolite you can see the carrots started

2466
01:49:52,069 --> 01:49:58,479
to form fingers I guess and they kind of

2467
01:49:56,359 --> 01:50:02,839
split into different different roots

2468
01:49:58,479 --> 01:50:04,899
which is kind of interesting and so the

2469
01:50:02,840 --> 01:50:07,960
current uses in industry for zeolite

2470
01:50:04,899 --> 01:50:11,210
include hard water treatment in

2471
01:50:07,960 --> 01:50:12,949
facilities where they take out all the

2472
01:50:11,210 --> 01:50:16,100
salts and other things that are in the

2473
01:50:12,949 --> 01:50:20,239
in the water it's used as a soil

2474
01:50:16,100 --> 01:50:23,060
additive mainly in in golf courses and

2475
01:50:20,239 --> 01:50:25,489
that's the Zeo Pro on the left here

2476
01:50:23,060 --> 01:50:28,670
that's the use of that I tried growing

2477
01:50:25,489 --> 01:50:30,210
in that but it was mainly micronutrients

2478
01:50:28,670 --> 01:50:32,369
there was no nitrogen

2479
01:50:30,210 --> 01:50:34,710
anything like that I did a water runoff

2480
01:50:32,369 --> 01:50:38,460
analysis and so that didn't really work

2481
01:50:34,710 --> 01:50:41,969
but it's also used as an odor eliminator

2482
01:50:38,460 --> 01:50:44,460
in horse stalls and cat litter and the

2483
01:50:41,969 --> 01:50:46,890
last thing which is pretty skeptical is

2484
01:50:44,460 --> 01:50:50,909
a detox which I wouldn't recommend

2485
01:50:46,890 --> 01:50:53,280
anybody so the commercial application

2486
01:50:50,909 --> 01:50:55,889
which I am trying to use this for is my

2487
01:50:53,279 --> 01:50:59,309
startup company called eco systems we're

2488
01:50:55,890 --> 01:51:01,619
making kitchen top growth chambers for

2489
01:50:59,310 --> 01:51:03,570
the consumer to grow their own culinary

2490
01:51:01,619 --> 01:51:06,059
herbs and you can think about it kind of

2491
01:51:03,569 --> 01:51:08,309
like a Keurig machine for plants where

2492
01:51:06,060 --> 01:51:09,840
you put the pod into the system fill up

2493
01:51:08,310 --> 01:51:11,789
with water and then it does everything

2494
01:51:09,840 --> 01:51:14,850
else for you it creates a controlled

2495
01:51:11,789 --> 01:51:16,680
environment for the plants and Vermont

2496
01:51:14,850 --> 01:51:21,060
and the app reminds you when you need to

2497
01:51:16,680 --> 01:51:23,159
do anything to take care of them so my

2498
01:51:21,060 --> 01:51:27,420
efforts with zeolite are trying to

2499
01:51:23,159 --> 01:51:29,189
develop this growth pod and so the first

2500
01:51:27,420 --> 01:51:32,760
experiment that I did was a germination

2501
01:51:29,189 --> 01:51:35,488
experiment there was five treatments and

2502
01:51:32,760 --> 01:51:38,369
three replicates of each treatment just

2503
01:51:35,488 --> 01:51:40,468
to see if it would happen just to see if

2504
01:51:38,369 --> 01:51:44,849
it could effectively germinate these

2505
01:51:40,469 --> 01:51:46,920
cilantro seeds and we so the treatments

2506
01:51:44,850 --> 01:51:51,329
the first one the control was with the

2507
01:51:46,920 --> 01:51:56,219
tap water soak and then a CEA fertilizer

2508
01:51:51,329 --> 01:51:59,250
recipe 1x strength soak going all the

2509
01:51:56,219 --> 01:52:02,760
way down to 8x and then a addition of

2510
01:51:59,250 --> 01:52:05,159
magnesium on the t3 and the CEA recipe

2511
01:52:02,760 --> 01:52:07,770
is basically just a two-part nutrient

2512
01:52:05,159 --> 01:52:11,519
solution with 125 parts per million

2513
01:52:07,770 --> 01:52:13,440
nitrogen target so the results from this

2514
01:52:11,520 --> 01:52:14,969
experiment are that I had high

2515
01:52:13,439 --> 01:52:19,229
germination across the board

2516
01:52:14,969 --> 01:52:22,500
besides the tap water treatment which is

2517
01:52:19,229 --> 01:52:24,809
kind of interesting and so the zeolite

2518
01:52:22,500 --> 01:52:27,630
was able to hold on to the nutrients for

2519
01:52:24,810 --> 01:52:30,300
the seedling stage but the design of

2520
01:52:27,630 --> 01:52:33,000
this experiment was such that there is

2521
01:52:30,300 --> 01:52:36,529
no tray or anything that would catch the

2522
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:39,060
runoff water underneath these pots so

2523
01:52:36,529 --> 01:52:42,659
after the seedling stage the growth kind

2524
01:52:39,060 --> 01:52:43,920
of stopped and I I think this is due to

2525
01:52:42,659 --> 01:52:47,279
leaching from

2526
01:52:43,920 --> 01:52:51,180
the just a clear water irrigation that

2527
01:52:47,279 --> 01:52:53,009
we were giving giving the plants and the

2528
01:52:51,180 --> 01:52:56,270
highest fresh weights and root weights

2529
01:52:53,010 --> 01:53:00,900
were observed in both t5 which is the

2530
01:52:56,270 --> 01:53:03,540
CEA 8 X oak and the CEA rescue plus

2531
01:53:00,899 --> 01:53:06,179
magnesium so as you can see the

2532
01:53:03,539 --> 01:53:08,519
magnesium one over here and the 8 X

2533
01:53:06,180 --> 01:53:11,940
right here and they have very

2534
01:53:08,520 --> 01:53:16,800
substantial root zones as compared to

2535
01:53:11,939 --> 01:53:19,429
these other three so the next experiment

2536
01:53:16,800 --> 01:53:23,039
that I did was trying to create this

2537
01:53:19,430 --> 01:53:25,560
sort of pod and the experiment here is

2538
01:53:23,039 --> 01:53:27,810
to replicate the different methods that

2539
01:53:25,560 --> 01:53:31,440
we might use in our system in our

2540
01:53:27,810 --> 01:53:35,520
product to kind of to provide this

2541
01:53:31,439 --> 01:53:37,769
service to our customers so the first

2542
01:53:35,520 --> 01:53:40,170
except the first treatment here is just

2543
01:53:37,770 --> 01:53:43,110
a it's kind of like a control with the

2544
01:53:40,170 --> 01:53:45,829
rockwool cubes and I'm growing lettuce

2545
01:53:43,109 --> 01:53:49,439
in this experiment

2546
01:53:45,829 --> 01:53:52,979
so there's five trays with four plants

2547
01:53:49,439 --> 01:53:57,000
in each tray and this replicate or this

2548
01:53:52,979 --> 01:54:00,599
treatment was being topped fertilized

2549
01:53:57,000 --> 01:54:03,000
with the the greenhouse fertilizer that

2550
01:54:00,600 --> 01:54:04,620
just comes out of the tap and so those

2551
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:07,260
nutrients were allowed to kind of

2552
01:54:04,619 --> 01:54:10,289
accumulate in the tray and this would

2553
01:54:07,260 --> 01:54:12,630
simulate if we were to have the consumer

2554
01:54:10,289 --> 01:54:14,399
add in nutrients to the reservoir

2555
01:54:12,630 --> 01:54:17,159
instead of having the nutrients in the

2556
01:54:14,399 --> 01:54:19,889
pod and then these two treatments were

2557
01:54:17,159 --> 01:54:25,260
with charge zeolite so zeolite soaked in

2558
01:54:19,890 --> 01:54:28,619
CDA 2 X and Z like charge charged in CEA

2559
01:54:25,260 --> 01:54:31,770
4x and so this is what it looked like

2560
01:54:28,619 --> 01:54:35,809
when I first started I took lettuce

2561
01:54:31,770 --> 01:54:38,190
seedlings and took away the rock wool on

2562
01:54:35,810 --> 01:54:41,130
for the majority of the rock wall and

2563
01:54:38,189 --> 01:54:43,229
left the roots intact transplanting them

2564
01:54:41,130 --> 01:54:45,449
it's the zeolite here and then I just

2565
01:54:43,229 --> 01:54:49,469
put the entire rock wall cube in the pot

2566
01:54:45,449 --> 01:54:53,769
on these trials and so the results for

2567
01:54:49,470 --> 01:54:56,800
this I took yesterday and so

2568
01:54:53,770 --> 01:54:59,410
it's awesome this is exactly what I

2569
01:54:56,800 --> 01:55:05,199
wanted so the highest yield comes from

2570
01:54:59,409 --> 01:55:06,779
the zeolite 4x so at one of the main one

2571
01:55:05,199 --> 01:55:10,929
of our main options moving forward

2572
01:55:06,779 --> 01:55:12,909
getting closer to product launch and

2573
01:55:10,930 --> 01:55:14,320
then this isn't necessarily an

2574
01:55:12,909 --> 01:55:17,289
experiment but this is just some

2575
01:55:14,319 --> 01:55:20,229
anecdotal growing that I did with the

2576
01:55:17,289 --> 01:55:23,100
hydroponics Club and so we did we grew

2577
01:55:20,229 --> 01:55:26,409
three carrots in a Dutch bucket system

2578
01:55:23,100 --> 01:55:28,840
purple carrots and next to it we have

2579
01:55:26,409 --> 01:55:31,329
beets and I know there's no control or

2580
01:55:28,840 --> 01:55:35,170
anything here but it's just kind of a

2581
01:55:31,329 --> 01:55:37,269
fun little Pro experiment and everybody

2582
01:55:35,170 --> 01:55:39,730
remembers this slide from the NASA when

2583
01:55:37,270 --> 01:55:43,690
big when they tried growing carrots well

2584
01:55:39,729 --> 01:55:46,659
this is what I got which is awesome

2585
01:55:43,689 --> 01:55:49,359
that's kind of cool so yeah they had the

2586
01:55:46,659 --> 01:55:54,219
same same kind of fingers that the NASA

2587
01:55:49,359 --> 01:55:59,979
carrots did and and a similar similar

2588
01:55:54,219 --> 01:56:02,439
height and fresh weight so yeah and this

2589
01:55:59,979 --> 01:56:06,789
is the prototype right now that we

2590
01:56:02,439 --> 01:56:09,339
currently have for our unit and I like

2591
01:56:06,789 --> 01:56:12,640
to call them Zeo pods and it's basically

2592
01:56:09,340 --> 01:56:14,590
charged zeolite in the base with a

2593
01:56:12,640 --> 01:56:18,310
little bit of rock wool on top for the

2594
01:56:14,590 --> 01:56:21,579
seedling germination and then enclosed

2595
01:56:18,310 --> 01:56:23,320
in the unit and everything so far has

2596
01:56:21,579 --> 01:56:27,488
been working pretty good in my house

2597
01:56:23,319 --> 01:56:30,069
so that's nice preliminary conclusions

2598
01:56:27,488 --> 01:56:31,449
from this or that zeolite has a water

2599
01:56:30,069 --> 01:56:34,090
and air holding capacity that's

2600
01:56:31,449 --> 01:56:35,949
comparable to potting mix the CEA is

2601
01:56:34,090 --> 01:56:40,710
adequate the whole nutrients for at

2602
01:56:35,949 --> 01:56:46,809
least the seedling stage zeolite zo pods

2603
01:56:40,710 --> 01:56:51,250
the the 4x oak was pretty across the

2604
01:56:46,810 --> 01:56:54,039
board and the zeolite is easily sipped

2605
01:56:51,250 --> 01:56:56,380
washed and autoclaved and able to be

2606
01:56:54,039 --> 01:56:58,539
used again unlike rock wool which is one

2607
01:56:56,380 --> 01:57:02,500
of the main reasons why I set out

2608
01:56:58,539 --> 01:57:05,800
studying zeolite so that's great and in

2609
01:57:02,500 --> 01:57:07,119
root crops it causes them to almost

2610
01:57:05,800 --> 01:57:09,220
bifurcate the

2611
01:57:07,119 --> 01:57:12,039
route and cause these formation of

2612
01:57:09,220 --> 01:57:13,810
fingers on the roots and further

2613
01:57:12,039 --> 01:57:16,659
experimentation I'd like to do over this

2614
01:57:13,810 --> 01:57:18,910
summer includes soaking the zeolite

2615
01:57:16,659 --> 01:57:22,059
incense Agra one of the issues that I

2616
01:57:18,909 --> 01:57:24,460
had in those trays was that the pH tends

2617
01:57:22,060 --> 01:57:27,280
to shoot up really high over the growth

2618
01:57:24,460 --> 01:57:31,930
cycles of these plants and we're not

2619
01:57:27,279 --> 01:57:35,859
we're not we want it to be able to have

2620
01:57:31,930 --> 01:57:39,039
the consumer not have to do anything to

2621
01:57:35,859 --> 01:57:41,529
adjust the pH in any way so I've already

2622
01:57:39,039 --> 01:57:43,989
tested this I've already tested this

2623
01:57:41,529 --> 01:57:46,659
fertilizer in my food computer that I

2624
01:57:43,989 --> 01:57:48,819
built and it's great it does it does its

2625
01:57:46,659 --> 01:57:50,800
job it regulates the pH keeps it at five

2626
01:57:48,819 --> 01:57:52,659
point eight which is really nice

2627
01:57:50,800 --> 01:57:55,390
and so hopefully if I socio light in

2628
01:57:52,659 --> 01:57:57,760
that and keep them in the trays it'll do

2629
01:57:55,390 --> 01:58:00,010
the same thing and then I'd like to do

2630
01:57:57,760 --> 01:58:03,150
more root crop trials and more Zeo pod

2631
01:58:00,010 --> 01:58:06,579
trials with different combinations so

2632
01:58:03,149 --> 01:58:09,159
and with that I'm just like to thank dr.

2633
01:58:06,579 --> 01:58:11,619
Neil Matson for being my advisor in all

2634
01:58:09,159 --> 01:58:14,170
my research Johnson not in the JumpStart

2635
01:58:11,619 --> 01:58:16,000
program for funding everything the

2636
01:58:14,170 --> 01:58:19,090
hydroponics Club for being my pride and

2637
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:21,939
joy KP a greenhouse staff or especially

2638
01:58:19,090 --> 01:58:24,880
Julie for everything that she's done in

2639
01:58:21,939 --> 01:58:29,049
the greenhouses for me and my team at

2640
01:58:24,880 --> 01:58:31,000
ecosystems so thank you very much I'll

2641
01:58:29,050 --> 01:58:35,609
take some questions if they're right

2642
01:58:31,000 --> 01:58:35,609
[Applause]

2643
01:58:36,429 --> 01:58:41,739
are the fingers that grown root crops

2644
01:58:39,710 --> 01:58:46,609
are those desirable like what's the

2645
01:58:41,738 --> 01:58:49,459
what's the point of them I think they're

2646
01:58:46,609 --> 01:58:51,319
pretty cool but in a supermarket I doubt

2647
01:58:49,460 --> 01:58:53,840
that they would sell very well because

2648
01:58:51,319 --> 01:58:59,498
everyone would be like wow those are GMO

2649
01:58:53,840 --> 01:59:03,529
carrots nobody wants to do that yeah but

2650
01:58:59,498 --> 01:59:05,478
Chris thought that it might be the fact

2651
01:59:03,529 --> 01:59:07,788
that when the root apical meristem

2652
01:59:05,479 --> 01:59:11,179
encounters something in its path it

2653
01:59:07,788 --> 01:59:13,340
tends to split so yeah I'd like to see

2654
01:59:11,179 --> 01:59:21,019
if that happens with like other crops

2655
01:59:13,340 --> 01:59:22,998
that every I don't know maybe they just

2656
01:59:21,019 --> 01:59:25,639
for some reason didn't see that result

2657
01:59:22,998 --> 01:59:28,099
on that first time I don't know why then

2658
01:59:25,639 --> 01:59:37,489
that happened but I saw it and all the

2659
01:59:28,099 --> 01:59:40,998
other all the other trials dissecting

2660
01:59:37,488 --> 01:59:43,549
the root tips did you try that I haven't

2661
01:59:40,998 --> 01:59:47,769
tried that yet no but I would expect it

2662
01:59:43,550 --> 01:59:52,060
to grow more similar to soil

2663
01:59:47,769 --> 01:59:56,329
absolutely thanks man

2664
01:59:52,060 --> 01:59:56,329
[Applause]

2665
01:59:59,539 --> 02:00:04,920
our next speaker is Kelly Damon and she

2666
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:08,909
will be talking about the hunger games

2667
02:00:04,920 --> 02:00:18,029
of cabbage varietal susceptibility to

2668
02:00:08,909 --> 02:00:20,309
black rot Kelly all right so thank you

2669
02:00:18,029 --> 02:00:23,729
everybody good afternoon I don't know

2670
02:00:20,310 --> 02:00:26,430
what I just did okay we're good so as

2671
02:00:23,729 --> 02:00:28,469
Chris said my name is Kelly Damon today

2672
02:00:26,430 --> 02:00:31,230
I'll be presenting on cabbage varietal

2673
02:00:28,470 --> 02:00:33,390
susceptibility to black rot and I did

2674
02:00:31,229 --> 02:00:37,500
this research in dr. Christine smarts

2675
02:00:33,390 --> 02:00:39,030
lab over the past summer so a little bit

2676
02:00:37,500 --> 02:00:42,060
of background about the project of this

2677
02:00:39,029 --> 02:00:44,609
goal it was essentially to identify the

2678
02:00:42,060 --> 02:00:46,610
different levels of susceptibility to

2679
02:00:44,609 --> 02:00:49,319
black rot and commercially available

2680
02:00:46,609 --> 02:00:52,500
cabbage varieties that cabbage farmers

2681
02:00:49,319 --> 02:00:54,090
would use in their own fields so a

2682
02:00:52,500 --> 02:00:57,270
little bit of background about the host

2683
02:00:54,090 --> 02:01:00,090
the disease and also the pathogen so the

2684
02:00:57,270 --> 02:01:02,160
host that we were running this

2685
02:01:00,090 --> 02:01:04,260
experiment with is cabbage

2686
02:01:02,159 --> 02:01:06,960
it is a cruciferous vegetable which is

2687
02:01:04,260 --> 02:01:08,400
part of the Brass Casey family I do have

2688
02:01:06,960 --> 02:01:10,380
pictures in case somebody doesn't know

2689
02:01:08,399 --> 02:01:12,089
what a cabbage looks like we have the

2690
02:01:10,380 --> 02:01:13,319
cabbage heads up here and just showing

2691
02:01:12,090 --> 02:01:15,869
you a little bit of differentiation

2692
02:01:13,319 --> 02:01:18,269
between it and then also in the middle

2693
02:01:15,869 --> 02:01:21,300
just a little bit of the cabbage growth

2694
02:01:18,270 --> 02:01:23,190
itself agitated grow so New York is

2695
02:01:21,300 --> 02:01:26,100
actually one of the top producers in the

2696
02:01:23,189 --> 02:01:28,799
United States of cabbage they produce

2697
02:01:26,100 --> 02:01:31,710
fresh as well as processed cabbage

2698
02:01:28,800 --> 02:01:34,619
including sauerkraut and it's estimated

2699
02:01:31,710 --> 02:01:36,149
value of production is forty eight point

2700
02:01:34,619 --> 02:01:39,300
six million dollars and that's according

2701
02:01:36,149 --> 02:01:42,389
to a 2017 sentence report done by the

2702
02:01:39,300 --> 02:01:43,949
USDA so a little bit of background about

2703
02:01:42,390 --> 02:01:46,320
the disease that I'm talking about today

2704
02:01:43,949 --> 02:01:50,159
black rot black out was first identified

2705
02:01:46,319 --> 02:01:53,489
in New York in 1896 and essentially

2706
02:01:50,159 --> 02:01:55,760
since then has been a common issue for

2707
02:01:53,489 --> 02:01:58,859
cabbage growers throughout the state

2708
02:01:55,760 --> 02:02:01,650
this disease does cause a lot of

2709
02:01:58,859 --> 02:02:04,849
academic growth or excuse me

2710
02:02:01,649 --> 02:02:07,889
economic loss to growers as it produces

2711
02:02:04,850 --> 02:02:09,300
undesirable heads of cabbage that the

2712
02:02:07,890 --> 02:02:11,789
farmers can't bring to the market to

2713
02:02:09,300 --> 02:02:14,100
sell and it also decreases the yields

2714
02:02:11,789 --> 02:02:17,539
that the farmers see

2715
02:02:14,100 --> 02:02:20,219
black rot is transmitted multiple ways

2716
02:02:17,539 --> 02:02:22,380
first being through seeds or transplants

2717
02:02:20,219 --> 02:02:25,260
that are already infected with this

2718
02:02:22,380 --> 02:02:27,179
pathogen as well as crop degrees that

2719
02:02:25,260 --> 02:02:28,800
were left over in the field and weeds

2720
02:02:27,179 --> 02:02:31,949
surrounding the field but its main

2721
02:02:28,800 --> 02:02:34,260
source to infect a crop is through water

2722
02:02:31,948 --> 02:02:38,759
droplets so such as rain or other

2723
02:02:34,260 --> 02:02:42,119
splashes and forms water so the pathogen

2724
02:02:38,760 --> 02:02:44,219
that causes black rot disease is known

2725
02:02:42,119 --> 02:02:46,289
as Xanthomonas campestris path of are

2726
02:02:44,219 --> 02:02:48,569
compassed risks and I'll be referring to

2727
02:02:46,289 --> 02:02:51,210
this as xs-3x ec throughout the

2728
02:02:48,569 --> 02:02:52,349
remainder of this presentation and you

2729
02:02:51,210 --> 02:02:54,210
can see here on the left side of the

2730
02:02:52,350 --> 02:02:56,400
screen the screen that it's a

2731
02:02:54,210 --> 02:02:58,500
gram-negative bacterium and this is just

2732
02:02:56,399 --> 02:03:00,779
a what I played it out to kind of show

2733
02:02:58,500 --> 02:03:02,130
you some of its characteristics and then

2734
02:03:00,779 --> 02:03:03,809
over here on the right side of the

2735
02:03:02,130 --> 02:03:08,300
screen you could see it's very

2736
02:03:03,810 --> 02:03:11,520
characteristic yellow v-shaped lesions

2737
02:03:08,300 --> 02:03:12,810
so how does this pathogen essentially

2738
02:03:11,520 --> 02:03:17,280
get into the plant to cause this

2739
02:03:12,810 --> 02:03:19,140
infection so xcc generally enters

2740
02:03:17,279 --> 02:03:20,460
through the high codes of a plant and

2741
02:03:19,140 --> 02:03:24,119
the highe thought is essentially just

2742
02:03:20,460 --> 02:03:25,739
modified pour along the leaf leaf margin

2743
02:03:24,119 --> 02:03:29,698
of the plant and you can see that right

2744
02:03:25,738 --> 02:03:31,908
here and from the height of codification

2745
02:03:29,698 --> 02:03:37,319
fluid which is essentially just water

2746
02:03:31,908 --> 02:03:40,139
build up right here is an easy source to

2747
02:03:37,319 --> 02:03:42,750
get contaminated by bacteria so the

2748
02:03:40,140 --> 02:03:44,789
bacteria essentially will move in to

2749
02:03:42,750 --> 02:03:47,359
this little droplet of water and you can

2750
02:03:44,789 --> 02:03:49,529
see how easy it is for it sir

2751
02:03:47,359 --> 02:03:51,420
essentially affecting the plant and

2752
02:03:49,529 --> 02:03:51,920
getting into the vascular system of the

2753
02:03:51,420 --> 02:03:54,090
plant

2754
02:03:51,920 --> 02:03:57,230
however the height of thon is not the

2755
02:03:54,090 --> 02:03:59,400
only entry point for xec as it can also

2756
02:03:57,229 --> 02:04:02,279
come into the plant through different

2757
02:03:59,399 --> 02:04:05,369
types of wounding such as bibury so

2758
02:04:02,279 --> 02:04:09,149
insect damage also held along with

2759
02:04:05,369 --> 02:04:11,519
different mechanical damage so one

2760
02:04:09,149 --> 02:04:14,250
secksy see is present in the plant

2761
02:04:11,520 --> 02:04:16,530
itself it can actually survive in this

2762
02:04:14,250 --> 02:04:18,810
island for many many months until

2763
02:04:16,529 --> 02:04:22,009
favorable conditions arise this is

2764
02:04:18,810 --> 02:04:24,719
essentially what what causes the large

2765
02:04:22,010 --> 02:04:26,789
the issues for the growers because they

2766
02:04:24,719 --> 02:04:29,220
don't know if their plants have black

2767
02:04:26,789 --> 02:04:31,289
or not until you get conduction

2768
02:04:29,220 --> 02:04:33,930
conditions which are warm and also wet

2769
02:04:31,289 --> 02:04:38,460
and once those condition of conditions

2770
02:04:33,930 --> 02:04:40,320
arise the bacteria can produce multiply

2771
02:04:38,460 --> 02:04:41,730
out very rapidly and then go

2772
02:04:40,319 --> 02:04:43,529
systemically throughout the plant

2773
02:04:41,729 --> 02:04:46,439
essentially getting into the cabbage

2774
02:04:43,529 --> 02:04:49,109
head itself and this image here is just

2775
02:04:46,439 --> 02:04:50,549
to show you another form of damage this

2776
02:04:49,109 --> 02:04:53,699
is hail damage and you can see the

2777
02:04:50,550 --> 02:04:55,380
discoloration in the leaf along with how

2778
02:04:53,699 --> 02:04:57,420
the veins are starting to blacken just a

2779
02:04:55,380 --> 02:05:01,260
little bit I'm starting to move through

2780
02:04:57,420 --> 02:05:03,569
the best there's some of this so

2781
02:05:01,260 --> 02:05:05,579
currently there's a couple control

2782
02:05:03,569 --> 02:05:07,769
methods that are available to growers

2783
02:05:05,579 --> 02:05:10,800
but most of them are preventative as

2784
02:05:07,770 --> 02:05:12,900
well as good management practices so for

2785
02:05:10,800 --> 02:05:15,510
starters you have just good sanitation

2786
02:05:12,899 --> 02:05:16,920
practices with tools and equipment along

2787
02:05:15,510 --> 02:05:19,650
with just making sure that the

2788
02:05:16,920 --> 02:05:22,230
greenhouse that the regrown is groanin

2789
02:05:19,649 --> 02:05:24,899
is sanitized along with this you can

2790
02:05:22,229 --> 02:05:27,869
also do crop rotation to help suppress

2791
02:05:24,899 --> 02:05:29,789
the pathogen and you can have pathogen

2792
02:05:27,869 --> 02:05:32,279
free seeds and transplants which is

2793
02:05:29,789 --> 02:05:33,988
always a good way to start and you can

2794
02:05:32,279 --> 02:05:36,000
control the weeds that are surrounding

2795
02:05:33,988 --> 02:05:38,879
the field especially those that are

2796
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:41,939
possibly close relatives in this sense

2797
02:05:38,880 --> 02:05:44,579
to the cabbage and it also has been

2798
02:05:41,939 --> 02:05:48,238
shown that some copper sprays have been

2799
02:05:44,579 --> 02:05:51,869
helpful in reducing the spread of black

2800
02:05:48,238 --> 02:05:54,929
rat as well so for the research I did we

2801
02:05:51,869 --> 02:05:57,569
started this on May 5th and we sewed 35

2802
02:05:54,930 --> 02:05:59,720
different cabbage cultivar varieties and

2803
02:05:57,569 --> 02:06:04,039
we did this face on different harp

2804
02:05:59,720 --> 02:06:08,340
harvesting points so we had 10 early

2805
02:06:04,039 --> 02:06:10,100
season cultivars 14 mid season and 11

2806
02:06:08,340 --> 02:06:13,050
late season cultivars that we planted

2807
02:06:10,100 --> 02:06:14,880
and then I'm May 31st after they grew a

2808
02:06:13,050 --> 02:06:16,890
little bit we move them up to the cold

2809
02:06:14,880 --> 02:06:19,590
frames which essentially it's just a box

2810
02:06:16,890 --> 02:06:22,230
with an open lid so those plants can

2811
02:06:19,590 --> 02:06:26,000
begin to get a little hearty before they

2812
02:06:22,229 --> 02:06:30,179
are transplanted into the field itself

2813
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:32,520
so then on June 12th we started to plant

2814
02:06:30,180 --> 02:06:35,700
the cabbage plants by hand there was

2815
02:06:32,520 --> 02:06:37,739
roughly about 700 cabbage plants that we

2816
02:06:35,699 --> 02:06:41,019
had plant so I fortunately had the help

2817
02:06:37,738 --> 02:06:43,419
of the smart lab to help you with

2818
02:06:41,019 --> 02:06:47,079
and we did a randomized complete block

2819
02:06:43,420 --> 02:06:49,449
design for this planting and the each

2820
02:06:47,078 --> 02:06:53,889
cultivar was planted in five plant pots

2821
02:06:49,448 --> 02:06:55,569
with four repetitions each so after they

2822
02:06:53,889 --> 02:06:56,708
had some time to kind of settle and get

2823
02:06:55,569 --> 02:06:59,139
used to the environment and get

2824
02:06:56,708 --> 02:07:02,109
established we then went out in the

2825
02:06:59,139 --> 02:07:05,050
early morning of June 27th to spray

2826
02:07:02,109 --> 02:07:07,299
inoculate with backpack sprayers we did

2827
02:07:05,050 --> 02:07:09,190
this in the early morning essentially

2828
02:07:07,300 --> 02:07:12,190
because this is when that mutation fluid

2829
02:07:09,189 --> 02:07:14,078
is most present as well as this is when

2830
02:07:12,189 --> 02:07:16,388
the cabbage plants are transpiring the

2831
02:07:14,078 --> 02:07:20,170
most so hopefully it increases our

2832
02:07:16,389 --> 02:07:22,239
chance for infection and what we used

2833
02:07:20,170 --> 02:07:26,019
was a New York strain of xec that was

2834
02:07:22,238 --> 02:07:27,939
isolated from the cabbage in 2010 um so

2835
02:07:26,019 --> 02:07:30,010
from there about a week and a half later

2836
02:07:27,939 --> 02:07:32,228
we waited to see if infections would

2837
02:07:30,010 --> 02:07:34,420
occur and then we started ratings of

2838
02:07:32,229 --> 02:07:36,729
percent incidence as well as severity

2839
02:07:34,420 --> 02:07:39,368
and we did that once a week for four

2840
02:07:36,729 --> 02:07:42,849
weeks and then after we did those

2841
02:07:39,368 --> 02:07:44,618
ratings we then waited until the first

2842
02:07:42,849 --> 02:07:47,590
harvest so the early harvest of the ten

2843
02:07:44,618 --> 02:07:49,929
the first time called barse and then

2844
02:07:47,590 --> 02:07:52,958
moved on to the fourteen midseason

2845
02:07:49,929 --> 02:07:55,929
cultivars and then the eleven late

2846
02:07:52,958 --> 02:07:59,529
season cultivars and when we harvested

2847
02:07:55,929 --> 02:08:01,510
we harvested two heads per plot so there

2848
02:07:59,529 --> 02:08:04,478
is a total of eight heads per cultivar

2849
02:08:01,510 --> 02:08:07,929
and how we rated these was on a visual

2850
02:08:04,479 --> 02:08:09,880
basis so this is just to kind of show

2851
02:08:07,929 --> 02:08:13,208
you a comparison between a susceptible

2852
02:08:09,880 --> 02:08:15,880
and a tolerant cause of our cabbage so

2853
02:08:13,208 --> 02:08:18,219
here on your left you have the cultivar

2854
02:08:15,880 --> 02:08:21,819
kazuma this is a slightly more

2855
02:08:18,219 --> 02:08:23,439
susceptible variety excuse me convert to

2856
02:08:21,819 --> 02:08:25,238
black wrap and you can see the

2857
02:08:23,439 --> 02:08:27,759
characteristics these shaped lesions on

2858
02:08:25,238 --> 02:08:30,638
the older leaves as well as on the

2859
02:08:27,760 --> 02:08:32,979
younger leeks that's two and then over

2860
02:08:30,639 --> 02:08:36,670
here on the right you have more tolerant

2861
02:08:32,979 --> 02:08:38,708
hotbar species so this is a capture and

2862
02:08:36,670 --> 02:08:40,779
you can see some of the v-shaped lesions

2863
02:08:38,708 --> 02:08:42,158
on older leaves however when you look at

2864
02:08:40,779 --> 02:08:47,349
the younger leaves there aren't as many

2865
02:08:42,158 --> 02:08:49,748
present if none at all and taking those

2866
02:08:47,349 --> 02:08:51,578
pictures onto this graph here this is

2867
02:08:49,748 --> 02:08:53,449
just showing the amount of disease over

2868
02:08:51,578 --> 02:08:56,210
time depending on

2869
02:08:53,449 --> 02:08:57,559
particular cultivars and from what I was

2870
02:08:56,210 --> 02:08:59,119
just showing you previously you could

2871
02:08:57,560 --> 02:09:01,730
see course uma here all the way on the

2872
02:08:59,119 --> 02:09:04,250
left is under the extremely susceptible

2873
02:09:01,729 --> 02:09:05,989
and there was you could see the

2874
02:09:04,250 --> 02:09:07,880
progression of disease throughout the

2875
02:09:05,989 --> 02:09:09,289
growing season however when you compare

2876
02:09:07,880 --> 02:09:13,279
that to the capture that I was just

2877
02:09:09,289 --> 02:09:14,689
talking about you could see that the the

2878
02:09:13,279 --> 02:09:18,949
amount of disease over the growing

2879
02:09:14,689 --> 02:09:22,429
period was a lot lower in essence - of

2880
02:09:18,949 --> 02:09:24,439
course we moved cultivar so when we did

2881
02:09:22,430 --> 02:09:27,950
these visual ratings we started with

2882
02:09:24,439 --> 02:09:30,229
looking at the core of the cabbage so we

2883
02:09:27,949 --> 02:09:32,750
would harvest basically just cut off the

2884
02:09:30,229 --> 02:09:35,359
cabbage head flip it over to look at the

2885
02:09:32,750 --> 02:09:37,210
core and what we were looking for this

2886
02:09:35,359 --> 02:09:39,799
is kind of the best picture of it is

2887
02:09:37,210 --> 02:09:44,480
kind of that blackening the black

2888
02:09:39,800 --> 02:09:46,400
lesions of the of the veins going into

2889
02:09:44,479 --> 02:09:47,899
the cabbage head and if we saw that

2890
02:09:46,399 --> 02:09:51,379
there was a good indication that there

2891
02:09:47,899 --> 02:09:55,399
might be black rot inside so after we

2892
02:09:51,380 --> 02:09:57,380
did that and all the heads that we

2893
02:09:55,399 --> 02:09:59,420
harvested which had black rot we would

2894
02:09:57,380 --> 02:10:01,460
then split them in half and look to see

2895
02:09:59,420 --> 02:10:03,980
how much infection was actually in the

2896
02:10:01,460 --> 02:10:06,199
head of cabbage so you could see on this

2897
02:10:03,979 --> 02:10:08,569
picture on her left the black route

2898
02:10:06,199 --> 02:10:11,599
moving into the cabbage and then how it

2899
02:10:08,569 --> 02:10:14,090
spreads throughout the cabbage head into

2900
02:10:11,600 --> 02:10:15,710
the center of the cabbage and this is

2901
02:10:14,090 --> 02:10:19,250
essentially what is making the cabbage

2902
02:10:15,710 --> 02:10:21,640
unmarketable for growers and these are

2903
02:10:19,250 --> 02:10:24,829
just a couple other images to show you

2904
02:10:21,640 --> 02:10:28,430
kind of the array if you will of disease

2905
02:10:24,829 --> 02:10:30,819
between the cabbage heads so once we

2906
02:10:28,430 --> 02:10:34,640
harvested all three season are all three

2907
02:10:30,819 --> 02:10:36,679
harvest seasons we then kind of looked

2908
02:10:34,640 --> 02:10:39,829
at the total comparison of percent of

2909
02:10:36,680 --> 02:10:42,770
affection of the cultivars throughout

2910
02:10:39,829 --> 02:10:45,140
those harvest times and you can see that

2911
02:10:42,770 --> 02:10:48,970
the early season which was harvested in

2912
02:10:45,140 --> 02:10:51,079
mid to late July had the least amount of

2913
02:10:48,970 --> 02:10:54,980
infection in the cabbage heads which we

2914
02:10:51,079 --> 02:10:57,109
were looking at and any of the cultivars

2915
02:10:54,979 --> 02:10:58,759
that don't have a green bar that just

2916
02:10:57,109 --> 02:11:01,159
indicates that when it harvested them

2917
02:10:58,760 --> 02:11:03,020
there was a zero percent infection in

2918
02:11:01,159 --> 02:11:06,260
those heads and as you progress

2919
02:11:03,020 --> 02:11:06,679
throughout the season the mid season and

2920
02:11:06,260 --> 02:11:09,530
late

2921
02:11:06,679 --> 02:11:12,800
in college birds generally had a higher

2922
02:11:09,529 --> 02:11:15,288
amount of infection especially in the

2923
02:11:12,800 --> 02:11:18,889
late season however I will note that

2924
02:11:15,288 --> 02:11:21,529
there are a couple cultivars in the late

2925
02:11:18,889 --> 02:11:24,109
season which still had 0% infection or

2926
02:11:21,529 --> 02:11:24,969
very minimal percent infection of black

2927
02:11:24,109 --> 02:11:28,368
crop

2928
02:11:24,969 --> 02:11:31,158
so in summary how would the research

2929
02:11:28,368 --> 02:11:32,658
that I did we have done this previous

2930
02:11:31,158 --> 02:11:34,549
growing seasons especially the year

2931
02:11:32,658 --> 02:11:36,408
before which was completely different

2932
02:11:34,550 --> 02:11:38,029
weather conditions however was

2933
02:11:36,408 --> 02:11:40,399
interesting to see that even with the

2934
02:11:38,029 --> 02:11:42,050
different weather conditions the

2935
02:11:40,399 --> 02:11:43,998
cultivar susceptibility basically

2936
02:11:42,050 --> 02:11:46,550
remained the same throughout those true

2937
02:11:43,998 --> 02:11:49,550
burrowing seasons also as I mentioned

2938
02:11:46,550 --> 02:11:52,519
earlier with the comparison of barsoom

2939
02:11:49,550 --> 02:11:56,840
a' and capture that some of the

2940
02:11:52,519 --> 02:11:59,179
cultivars had infection in the early

2941
02:11:56,840 --> 02:12:02,569
stages but once the new newer leafs rose

2942
02:11:59,179 --> 02:12:04,609
you didn't see as much infection also

2943
02:12:02,569 --> 02:12:07,340
the third point is that the cultivars

2944
02:12:04,609 --> 02:12:10,098
showing internal symptoms were generally

2945
02:12:07,340 --> 02:12:12,949
associated with the most foliar black

2946
02:12:10,099 --> 02:12:14,569
rat and also in regards to the last

2947
02:12:12,948 --> 02:12:16,908
slide we looked at looked at the last

2948
02:12:14,569 --> 02:12:18,978
graph the mid and late season college

2949
02:12:16,908 --> 02:12:21,288
berg showed more internal symptoms of

2950
02:12:18,979 --> 02:12:23,300
black rats in the early harvested and

2951
02:12:21,288 --> 02:12:25,759
this is essentially probably probably

2952
02:12:23,300 --> 02:12:26,869
because they were in the field longer so

2953
02:12:25,760 --> 02:12:30,889
they had a greater chance of getting

2954
02:12:26,868 --> 02:12:33,438
infected I'm more seriously impacted so

2955
02:12:30,889 --> 02:12:36,349
I don't know I'd like to acknowledge dr.

2956
02:12:33,439 --> 02:12:38,840
Christine smart for letting me help out

2957
02:12:36,349 --> 02:12:41,019
in the lab and run this experiment as

2958
02:12:38,840 --> 02:12:44,260
well as Holly Lang who was my supervisor

2959
02:12:41,019 --> 02:12:47,719
during this time and also the entire

2960
02:12:44,260 --> 02:12:50,179
2017 smart lab the grad students and the

2961
02:12:47,719 --> 02:12:52,578
Summer Scholars and also the cabbage

2962
02:12:50,179 --> 02:12:53,899
research and development program which

2963
02:12:52,578 --> 02:12:56,090
if it wasn't for them we wouldn't be

2964
02:12:53,899 --> 02:13:03,348
able to do this research so thank you

2965
02:12:56,090 --> 02:13:05,958
and I'm happy to take any questions are

2966
02:13:03,349 --> 02:13:08,739
there wild resistant relatives sister

2967
02:13:05,958 --> 02:13:11,420
groups of commercial cabbage from which

2968
02:13:08,738 --> 02:13:15,018
resistance genes could be harvested or

2969
02:13:11,420 --> 02:13:17,479
bred in what's the deal there so I'm not

2970
02:13:15,019 --> 02:13:19,400
100% sure so I can't fully answer that

2971
02:13:17,479 --> 02:13:20,449
question but I would assume that there

2972
02:13:19,399 --> 02:13:22,849
probably are some

2973
02:13:20,449 --> 02:13:24,769
resistant cultivars out there which

2974
02:13:22,850 --> 02:13:27,010
potentially future research can be done

2975
02:13:24,770 --> 02:13:29,510
in that and seeing if somehow we can

2976
02:13:27,010 --> 02:13:33,280
inherit a breeding system possibly to

2977
02:13:29,510 --> 02:13:33,280
get these calls Barsky more tolerant

2978
02:13:34,000 --> 02:13:43,550
questions so I'm curious about the

2979
02:13:41,810 --> 02:13:46,550
mechanism in which the inoculation

2980
02:13:43,550 --> 02:13:49,220
occurs so since you have the hide their

2981
02:13:46,550 --> 02:13:51,470
codes that are secreting water outside

2982
02:13:49,220 --> 02:13:53,180
I'm supposing that collects bacteria

2983
02:13:51,470 --> 02:13:55,030
does it like suck it back in or

2984
02:13:53,180 --> 02:13:58,550
something or does it just sort of

2985
02:13:55,029 --> 02:14:01,149
randomly by chance going to the veins

2986
02:13:58,550 --> 02:14:01,150
yeah

2987
02:14:02,840 --> 02:14:06,860
so in essence that's why we did it in

2988
02:14:05,180 --> 02:14:09,260
the early morning because the fluid is

2989
02:14:06,859 --> 02:14:12,679
so prevalent so it does increase our

2990
02:14:09,260 --> 02:14:14,960
chances for infection and generally the

2991
02:14:12,680 --> 02:14:17,510
cute asian fluid is due to the pressure

2992
02:14:14,960 --> 02:14:19,159
basically in a root system and the plant

2993
02:14:17,510 --> 02:14:21,079
itself can't handle that amount of water

2994
02:14:19,159 --> 02:14:23,239
um so it's trying to shoot it out so one

2995
02:14:21,079 --> 02:14:25,309
step I would assume once it balances out

2996
02:14:23,239 --> 02:14:27,559
with the roots and everything that it

2997
02:14:25,310 --> 02:14:29,810
would essentially decrease vegetation

2998
02:14:27,560 --> 02:14:32,090
fluid which in essence could suck the

2999
02:14:29,810 --> 02:14:36,370
bacteria back and kind of help it get

3000
02:14:32,090 --> 02:14:36,369
into the back there's a little bit more

3001
02:14:37,930 --> 02:14:44,350
other questions thanks

3002
02:14:44,500 --> 02:14:49,520
you

3003
02:14:46,420 --> 02:14:49,520
[Applause]

3004
02:14:52,460 --> 02:14:59,279
our next speaker is Patrick O'Brien and

3005
02:14:56,270 --> 02:15:02,190
he will be talking about a push/pull

3006
02:14:59,279 --> 02:15:08,309
agro-ecosystem sustainably manipulating

3007
02:15:02,189 --> 02:15:11,279
try trophic interactions so I'm gonna be

3008
02:15:08,310 --> 02:15:15,270
talking to you today about biological

3009
02:15:11,279 --> 02:15:18,359
control of a invasive pest species in

3010
02:15:15,270 --> 02:15:20,790
Africa to start though I'm gonna zoom

3011
02:15:18,359 --> 02:15:25,649
way out to a bigger issue of food

3012
02:15:20,789 --> 02:15:27,859
security and there's four four points to

3013
02:15:25,649 --> 02:15:31,710
food security that matter in this case

3014
02:15:27,859 --> 02:15:34,639
availability is is being able to access

3015
02:15:31,710 --> 02:15:40,140
your food at any time that you need to

3016
02:15:34,640 --> 02:15:43,320
access itself is is related to being

3017
02:15:40,140 --> 02:15:47,400
able to have the food in a in a location

3018
02:15:43,319 --> 02:15:51,059
that you can reach say we run into this

3019
02:15:47,399 --> 02:15:55,469
issue in in urban areas in a in the US

3020
02:15:51,060 --> 02:15:57,960
where the the problem becomes the only

3021
02:15:55,470 --> 02:16:00,780
available source is there's a liquor

3022
02:15:57,960 --> 02:16:04,189
store in the in the area but not any

3023
02:16:00,779 --> 02:16:04,189
grocery stores or things like that

3024
02:16:04,489 --> 02:16:09,840
additionally we want to we want

3025
02:16:06,300 --> 02:16:14,430
nutritious food so I mean the food needs

3026
02:16:09,840 --> 02:16:15,960
to be supportive of a healthy lifestyle

3027
02:16:14,430 --> 02:16:19,770
for for yourself

3028
02:16:15,960 --> 02:16:23,130
and ultimately appropriate that means we

3029
02:16:19,770 --> 02:16:26,150
can't just come in and dictate what what

3030
02:16:23,130 --> 02:16:31,109
people grow for themselves to lead a

3031
02:16:26,149 --> 02:16:36,500
healthy and happy lifestyle so zooming

3032
02:16:31,109 --> 02:16:41,069
in on on Kenya itself food security wise

3033
02:16:36,500 --> 02:16:46,319
it's 33% of sub-saharan African

3034
02:16:41,069 --> 02:16:48,979
countries are food insecure so anything

3035
02:16:46,319 --> 02:16:51,269
below the desert are running into a

3036
02:16:48,979 --> 02:16:53,399
substantial problem with providing

3037
02:16:51,269 --> 02:16:58,349
themselves with healthy and appropriate

3038
02:16:53,399 --> 02:17:01,440
food in Kenya itself 80% of the

3039
02:16:58,349 --> 02:17:04,280
population either lives off the food

3040
02:17:01,440 --> 02:17:08,019
that they grow themselves or they live

3041
02:17:04,280 --> 02:17:11,679
of me selling the the agricultural

3042
02:17:08,019 --> 02:17:15,260
products that they make and with in

3043
02:17:11,679 --> 02:17:18,170
Kenya itself 10 million plus people are

3044
02:17:15,260 --> 02:17:21,889
food insecure you can see the more

3045
02:17:18,170 --> 02:17:25,579
heavily affected areas here and a little

3046
02:17:21,888 --> 02:17:28,399
less so here I'll be working with Boveda

3047
02:17:25,579 --> 02:17:32,120
lab down here on this offshoot of Lake

3048
02:17:28,399 --> 02:17:35,058
Victoria where it's a little less

3049
02:17:32,120 --> 02:17:39,349
affected by food security issues but

3050
02:17:35,058 --> 02:17:41,329
this is to note that this is previous to

3051
02:17:39,349 --> 02:17:44,659
the introduction of the pests each

3052
02:17:41,329 --> 02:17:48,468
species that I'm talking about this

3053
02:17:44,659 --> 02:17:50,569
species is adopter of Kruger para or

3054
02:17:48,468 --> 02:17:55,989
fall army worm it's native to this

3055
02:17:50,569 --> 02:18:00,199
region of the u.s. it was introduced in

3056
02:17:55,989 --> 02:18:03,888
2016 they found it in Nigeria and South

3057
02:18:00,200 --> 02:18:09,650
tomé and príncipe and since that time it

3058
02:18:03,888 --> 02:18:13,549
is now from this line south it is in

3059
02:18:09,649 --> 02:18:17,690
every country in in Africa Africa just

3060
02:18:13,549 --> 02:18:22,539
happens to have a very conducive climate

3061
02:18:17,690 --> 02:18:27,380
to this this insect on breeding and

3062
02:18:22,540 --> 02:18:31,160
spreading so here in America we we

3063
02:18:27,379 --> 02:18:35,839
control it by a BT crops and by pest

3064
02:18:31,159 --> 02:18:37,670
insecticides for the folks that I'm

3065
02:18:35,840 --> 02:18:41,389
we're going to be working directly with

3066
02:18:37,670 --> 02:18:45,260
it's mostly about subsistence farmers so

3067
02:18:41,388 --> 02:18:48,049
on a general basis they can't afford the

3068
02:18:45,260 --> 02:18:52,130
insecticides to be used to control this

3069
02:18:48,049 --> 02:18:58,308
insect BT is is a non-issue because

3070
02:18:52,129 --> 02:19:01,609
Kenya doesn't allow GMO crops so the

3071
02:18:58,308 --> 02:19:05,449
difference between a common pests that

3072
02:19:01,610 --> 02:19:11,269
Kenya is affected by African army worm

3073
02:19:05,450 --> 02:19:14,090
and the fall army worm is that when the

3074
02:19:11,269 --> 02:19:16,760
African army worm it targets their grain

3075
02:19:14,090 --> 02:19:21,529
crops when it has

3076
02:19:16,760 --> 02:19:24,978
said to the point of being satisfied it

3077
02:19:21,529 --> 02:19:28,849
moves on to another another agricultural

3078
02:19:24,978 --> 02:19:31,549
plot the the fall army worm instead

3079
02:19:28,849 --> 02:19:35,090
switches to different host plants and

3080
02:19:31,549 --> 02:19:39,018
completely devastates these these two

3081
02:19:35,090 --> 02:19:40,939
sis's farmers crops and with that their

3082
02:19:39,019 --> 02:19:46,068
livelihoods

3083
02:19:40,939 --> 02:19:48,469
so a beta lab is working with ACP the

3084
02:19:46,068 --> 02:19:52,309
International Centre for insect

3085
02:19:48,468 --> 02:19:56,289
physiology and ecology and we're working

3086
02:19:52,309 --> 02:19:59,648
on a push-pull system agro-ecosystem

3087
02:19:56,290 --> 02:20:03,350
that is a type of intercropping that

3088
02:19:59,648 --> 02:20:07,219
works well on the Triboro frog

3089
02:20:03,350 --> 02:20:12,710
interactions that is the effects of the

3090
02:20:07,219 --> 02:20:15,709
the host plant and the insect pest and

3091
02:20:12,709 --> 02:20:19,669
their natural enemies what we're looking

3092
02:20:15,709 --> 02:20:24,489
at is intercropping the corn with a

3093
02:20:19,670 --> 02:20:28,489
desmo diem species that is a basis plant

3094
02:20:24,489 --> 02:20:30,770
that brings in it adds nitrogen to the

3095
02:20:28,489 --> 02:20:36,289
system for the the maize plants

3096
02:20:30,770 --> 02:20:39,649
initially desmo diem was used here desmo

3097
02:20:36,290 --> 02:20:44,420
diem was used to control Strega invasive

3098
02:20:39,648 --> 02:20:48,309
weed parasitic we and they found that it

3099
02:20:44,420 --> 02:20:52,939
also releases some volatile chemicals

3100
02:20:48,309 --> 02:20:57,199
that that the insect pests are repelled

3101
02:20:52,939 --> 02:21:00,139
by so so the desmo diem helps to push

3102
02:20:57,200 --> 02:21:03,710
the the insects away from the maize

3103
02:21:00,139 --> 02:21:07,068
plants and nature grass releases

3104
02:21:03,709 --> 02:21:11,568
volatiles that are an attractant to the

3105
02:21:07,068 --> 02:21:14,209
insect pests so in conjunction the the

3106
02:21:11,568 --> 02:21:16,939
two species intercropped with corn help

3107
02:21:14,209 --> 02:21:19,728
push push the insect pests out to the

3108
02:21:16,939 --> 02:21:24,950
Napier grass make your dress also acts

3109
02:21:19,728 --> 02:21:28,699
as a butter crop for their animal

3110
02:21:24,950 --> 02:21:30,180
livestock so they have that benefit as

3111
02:21:28,700 --> 02:21:32,659
well

3112
02:21:30,180 --> 02:21:36,659
so what we're specifically looking at is

3113
02:21:32,659 --> 02:21:39,299
is how the interaction between the to

3114
02:21:36,659 --> 02:21:43,648
help to the the increased diversity

3115
02:21:39,299 --> 02:21:49,019
helps bring in parasitoid wasps that

3116
02:21:43,648 --> 02:21:51,898
target the insect s species so the

3117
02:21:49,020 --> 02:21:56,909
insect though the wasp in question is

3118
02:21:51,898 --> 02:22:01,648
shallowness what we saw a year ago was

3119
02:21:56,909 --> 02:22:04,020
that even with how how knew how newly

3120
02:22:01,648 --> 02:22:06,959
introduced the the pest species is to

3121
02:22:04,020 --> 02:22:12,000
the area we found this species of wasps

3122
02:22:06,959 --> 02:22:15,599
that typically targets spa doctoral in

3123
02:22:12,000 --> 02:22:18,350
general it has switched to the new

3124
02:22:15,600 --> 02:22:22,920
target these these introduced species

3125
02:22:18,350 --> 02:22:25,920
what it does is it comes in and it finds

3126
02:22:22,920 --> 02:22:31,710
the clutches of eggs it lays eggs within

3127
02:22:25,920 --> 02:22:37,469
the eggs and it the parasitoid babies

3128
02:22:31,709 --> 02:22:40,049
stay within the eggs and into this state

3129
02:22:37,469 --> 02:22:44,099
into the larval stage where they they

3130
02:22:40,049 --> 02:22:49,139
burst forth similar to the movie alien

3131
02:22:44,100 --> 02:22:53,790
to go forward and and terrorize future

3132
02:22:49,139 --> 02:22:56,459
spa doctoral so our experiment is going

3133
02:22:53,790 --> 02:23:00,439
to be we're going to lay Sentinel

3134
02:22:56,459 --> 02:23:03,750
clutches of eggs on within the the

3135
02:23:00,439 --> 02:23:06,180
protocol system plots and we're going to

3136
02:23:03,750 --> 02:23:08,850
give it a set amount of time we're going

3137
02:23:06,180 --> 02:23:14,029
to come back before they become larvae

3138
02:23:08,850 --> 02:23:17,029
and collect the eggs to account both the

3139
02:23:14,029 --> 02:23:20,670
parasitoid rate comparison size the

3140
02:23:17,029 --> 02:23:23,609
parasitism rate and to account how many

3141
02:23:20,670 --> 02:23:27,299
have been predated on by other species

3142
02:23:23,609 --> 02:23:31,170
so we're going to collect that

3143
02:23:27,299 --> 02:23:32,519
information we're going to go to we're

3144
02:23:31,170 --> 02:23:35,670
going to be stationed here where is see

3145
02:23:32,520 --> 02:23:38,729
fade campuses and will be in this rural

3146
02:23:35,670 --> 02:23:44,228
region here working with both farmers

3147
02:23:38,728 --> 02:23:47,299
that have accepted the our help here

3148
02:23:44,228 --> 02:23:49,010
so we're gonna have roughly ten farms

3149
02:23:47,299 --> 02:23:51,679
they're going to be separated by at

3150
02:23:49,010 --> 02:23:53,238
least two miles from each other and

3151
02:23:51,680 --> 02:23:56,328
we're gonna be controlling for the

3152
02:23:53,238 --> 02:24:00,228
push-pull system and unconventional

3153
02:23:56,328 --> 02:24:03,648
systems of agriculture for subsistence

3154
02:24:00,228 --> 02:24:06,078
farmers on collection day we're gonna

3155
02:24:03,648 --> 02:24:08,389
hopefully beat this this instance so we

3156
02:24:06,078 --> 02:24:12,998
don't spread more adopter into the

3157
02:24:08,389 --> 02:24:15,349
region we're gonna be looking for

3158
02:24:12,998 --> 02:24:16,458
basically how much damage has happened

3159
02:24:15,350 --> 02:24:20,088
to the plants

3160
02:24:16,459 --> 02:24:24,229
recording that's dr. Andre Ressler and

3161
02:24:20,088 --> 02:24:26,148
that's Ethan from the kessler lab so

3162
02:24:24,228 --> 02:24:29,358
we're gonna be looking at the parasitism

3163
02:24:26,148 --> 02:24:33,189
rate we're also going to be running

3164
02:24:29,359 --> 02:24:36,949
transects within the the field itself

3165
02:24:33,189 --> 02:24:40,639
with bug nets to catch additional

3166
02:24:36,949 --> 02:24:44,498
species richness and abundance and we're

3167
02:24:40,639 --> 02:24:46,788
also going to do it fall traps to see if

3168
02:24:44,498 --> 02:24:48,799
there's any correlation between the

3169
02:24:46,789 --> 02:24:50,539
predation rate of the eggs and maybe

3170
02:24:48,799 --> 02:24:54,498
some species that we haven't looked at

3171
02:24:50,539 --> 02:24:56,600
previously so the outcomes we hope to

3172
02:24:54,498 --> 02:25:00,918
have from this is to intensify our

3173
02:24:56,600 --> 02:25:03,109
network with with a CPA working with the

3174
02:25:00,918 --> 02:25:05,628
farmers themselves and establish a

3175
02:25:03,109 --> 02:25:10,430
better network with that this is a very

3176
02:25:05,629 --> 02:25:12,079
preliminary work so far and with these

3177
02:25:10,430 --> 02:25:14,088
working with the extension workers to

3178
02:25:12,078 --> 02:25:17,389
get this information out to the farmers

3179
02:25:14,088 --> 02:25:20,838
themselves so that we can start working

3180
02:25:17,389 --> 02:25:22,728
on controlling this pest so we're hoping

3181
02:25:20,838 --> 02:25:25,549
to find some correlation with the

3182
02:25:22,728 --> 02:25:28,849
parasitism rate and the the push-pull

3183
02:25:25,549 --> 02:25:31,248
system and hopefully get a damage

3184
02:25:28,850 --> 02:25:34,129
reduction for the plants and see a

3185
02:25:31,248 --> 02:25:38,180
little more production for the the

3186
02:25:34,129 --> 02:25:40,159
farmers itself so I'd like to thank Alex

3187
02:25:38,180 --> 02:25:43,729
little fellows their funding me getting

3188
02:25:40,158 --> 02:25:49,728
out there havedo lab my mentor copy of

3189
02:25:43,728 --> 02:25:52,938
ADA my NPI and the graduate student

3190
02:25:49,728 --> 02:25:56,328
who's who's kind of figure headed this

3191
02:25:52,939 --> 02:25:57,370
project in Luna Mercer and will be

3192
02:25:56,328 --> 02:26:00,220
working

3193
02:25:57,370 --> 02:26:03,870
closely with Kessler lab as well dr.

3194
02:26:00,220 --> 02:26:10,059
Andre Kessler and from the CEPA campus

3195
02:26:03,870 --> 02:26:16,500
dr. Khan and dr. Mann daga thank you for

3196
02:26:10,059 --> 02:26:16,500
[Applause]

3197
02:26:18,600 --> 02:26:21,709
[Music]

3198
02:26:23,040 --> 02:26:32,350
the the armyworm onto the maze park that

3199
02:26:28,989 --> 02:26:37,210
over does the does vidya push the

3200
02:26:32,351 --> 02:26:41,200
armyworm on to the maze no it it works

3201
02:26:37,210 --> 02:26:43,630
to push the the armyworm away from the

3202
02:26:41,200 --> 02:26:46,091
insect pest and generally the volatiles

3203
02:26:43,630 --> 02:26:53,229
are repellent away from the system

3204
02:26:46,091 --> 02:26:55,421
itself in together with the the trap

3205
02:26:53,229 --> 02:26:59,649
crop that pulled in a pure grass they

3206
02:26:55,421 --> 02:27:01,560
they had just individually they worked

3207
02:26:59,649 --> 02:27:04,899
fairly well but together they were

3208
02:27:01,560 --> 02:27:10,199
exceptionally well at pulling the the

3209
02:27:04,899 --> 02:27:10,199
pest species away from the your crops I

3210
02:27:11,011 --> 02:27:16,541
think you said that the caterpillars are

3211
02:27:13,899 --> 02:27:19,960
able to move from one plant toast to

3212
02:27:16,540 --> 02:27:23,020
another but like how do they do that if

3213
02:27:19,960 --> 02:27:25,510
they're little caterpillars well it's

3214
02:27:23,021 --> 02:27:29,200
the caterpillars and so stay within the

3215
02:27:25,511 --> 02:27:33,671
area the the moths age is highly mobile

3216
02:27:29,200 --> 02:27:37,511
so it's been spreading that way and they

3217
02:27:33,671 --> 02:27:41,880
just have a very rapid generation time

3218
02:27:37,511 --> 02:27:41,881
now that they're in a conducive climate

3219
02:27:45,780 --> 02:27:52,498
Thank You Patrick

3220
02:27:48,200 --> 02:27:52,499

3221
02:27:55,619 --> 02:28:01,140
our next speaker is Katie Mazur and she

3222
02:27:59,068 --> 02:28:04,469
will be talking today about crop load

3223
02:28:01,139 --> 02:28:09,809
and harvest management for hard cider or

3224
02:28:04,469 --> 02:28:11,278
Church thank you Chris yes thank you hi

3225
02:28:09,809 --> 02:28:12,600
everyone so today I'm gonna be talking

3226
02:28:11,279 --> 02:28:14,550
about my involvement in this while I was

3227
02:28:12,600 --> 02:28:19,020
a fruit intern at the Cornell orchard

3228
02:28:14,549 --> 02:28:22,559
last year working with so a little bit

3229
02:28:19,020 --> 02:28:23,850
of history about hard cider hearts a is

3230
02:28:22,559 --> 02:28:26,368
actually very culturally important to

3231
02:28:23,850 --> 02:28:28,738
American history well one of the reasons

3232
02:28:26,369 --> 02:28:30,270
being is that fruit trees were shown

3233
02:28:28,738 --> 02:28:32,629
that you had a long term stake in the

3234
02:28:30,270 --> 02:28:35,399
land so as people were moving west and

3235
02:28:32,629 --> 02:28:36,809
settling the frontier having those fruit

3236
02:28:35,398 --> 02:28:39,108
trees indicated that they were actually

3237
02:28:36,809 --> 02:28:41,340
meant there to stay and actually had

3238
02:28:39,109 --> 02:28:44,430
stake in the land and one of the more

3239
02:28:41,340 --> 02:28:46,408
popular fruit trees was apples so from

3240
02:28:44,430 --> 02:28:48,210
that hard cider usually was produced by

3241
02:28:46,408 --> 02:28:49,648
many homeowners and farmers it was one

3242
02:28:48,209 --> 02:28:51,898
of the more easier things for them to

3243
02:28:49,648 --> 02:28:54,028
make especially compared to say grapes

3244
02:28:51,898 --> 02:28:57,269
since they're difficult to grow over

3245
02:28:54,029 --> 02:28:59,340
things like buy locks rough however if

3246
02:28:57,270 --> 02:29:00,840
you jump closer jump forward to the

3247
02:28:59,340 --> 02:29:02,369
beginning of the 20th century there was

3248
02:29:00,840 --> 02:29:04,710
about three different things that kind

3249
02:29:02,369 --> 02:29:06,540
of put the nail in the coffin first out

3250
02:29:04,709 --> 02:29:08,698
of production one of them was a large

3251
02:29:06,540 --> 02:29:10,829
immigration of northern and central

3252
02:29:08,699 --> 02:29:12,949
European immigrants to America who

3253
02:29:10,828 --> 02:29:15,420
actually had a preference for beer and

3254
02:29:12,949 --> 02:29:17,819
most beer was made from grain it was

3255
02:29:15,420 --> 02:29:20,760
very easy to transport that grain the

3256
02:29:17,818 --> 02:29:22,648
second one was excuse me prohibition so

3257
02:29:20,760 --> 02:29:25,350
prohibition lasted from the 1920s till

3258
02:29:22,648 --> 02:29:27,809
1933 and even though there were some

3259
02:29:25,350 --> 02:29:29,189
caveats within prohibition for people to

3260
02:29:27,809 --> 02:29:31,228
actually make cider at home because it

3261
02:29:29,189 --> 02:29:34,229
was illegal to make and sell alcohol

3262
02:29:31,228 --> 02:29:36,028
that still put a big damper on it and

3263
02:29:34,228 --> 02:29:38,188
the last one was the temperance

3264
02:29:36,029 --> 02:29:39,810
religious movement who wide a complete

3265
02:29:38,189 --> 02:29:41,189
and utter ban on all alcohol to the

3266
02:29:39,809 --> 02:29:44,359
point where they would go and ashlee

3267
02:29:41,189 --> 02:29:47,550
burn down orchards as their method of

3268
02:29:44,359 --> 02:29:49,470
protest if you will so after that there

3269
02:29:47,549 --> 02:29:54,599
was a huge decrease in center production

3270
02:29:49,469 --> 02:29:56,278
until about 2011 during that time there

3271
02:29:54,600 --> 02:29:58,318
was an astronomical growth in the cider

3272
02:29:56,279 --> 02:30:00,060
industry and this was partially due the

3273
02:29:58,318 --> 02:30:04,170
craft beer movement and the great

3274
02:30:00,059 --> 02:30:06,090
interest in craft alcohol making so from

3275
02:30:04,170 --> 02:30:08,309
that there's been a 900 percent increase

3276
02:30:06,090 --> 02:30:09,300
in cider production volume alone and in

3277
02:30:08,309 --> 02:30:11,880
New York

3278
02:30:09,300 --> 02:30:15,810
in 2015-2016 there was over 5 million

3279
02:30:11,880 --> 02:30:17,430
gallons of hard cider made so this is

3280
02:30:15,810 --> 02:30:19,081
really important in the case of hard

3281
02:30:17,431 --> 02:30:20,581
cider is because scuse me cider apples

3282
02:30:19,081 --> 02:30:22,161
because Santa rappers make the best hard

3283
02:30:20,581 --> 02:30:24,511
cider you can get there it has all the

3284
02:30:22,161 --> 02:30:26,911
Tenon's in the phenolic compound need to

3285
02:30:24,511 --> 02:30:29,101
make a nice complex cider versus

3286
02:30:26,911 --> 02:30:30,569
culinary outlets and in New York this is

3287
02:30:29,101 --> 02:30:32,431
especially prevalent because we have

3288
02:30:30,569 --> 02:30:34,770
around 100 cider producers which is the

3289
02:30:32,431 --> 02:30:36,271
most in the entire country there's a

3290
02:30:34,771 --> 02:30:38,190
Saito producer in every single state but

3291
02:30:36,271 --> 02:30:40,110
we hold the most out of any of them and

3292
02:30:38,190 --> 02:30:42,569
here is actually a little example right

3293
02:30:40,110 --> 02:30:44,041
here from Black Diamond farm and cider E

3294
02:30:42,569 --> 02:30:47,720
which I believe that's their Hicks

3295
02:30:44,040 --> 02:30:50,399
decided that we got to try last year so

3296
02:30:47,720 --> 02:30:52,620
there's been a great demand for hard

3297
02:30:50,399 --> 02:30:54,210
cider apples but there's been a bit of

3298
02:30:52,620 --> 02:30:55,470
an issue nationally meeting that demand

3299
02:30:54,210 --> 02:30:57,689
and the reason for that is something

3300
02:30:55,470 --> 02:30:59,370
called biannual bearing so this is also

3301
02:30:57,690 --> 02:31:00,931
known as alternative or a regular

3302
02:30:59,370 --> 02:31:02,850
bearing and there's two different

3303
02:31:00,931 --> 02:31:04,501
theories as to why biennial bearing has

3304
02:31:02,851 --> 02:31:07,771
occurred so the first one is the

3305
02:31:04,501 --> 02:31:09,451
carbohydrate capacity so basically the

3306
02:31:07,771 --> 02:31:11,431
tree has so much carbohydrate stored

3307
02:31:09,450 --> 02:31:13,470
within it to go through its growth

3308
02:31:11,431 --> 02:31:15,240
functions the first things it needs to

3309
02:31:13,470 --> 02:31:17,819
do is for growth and survival the second

3310
02:31:15,240 --> 02:31:18,720
everything else goes towards flowering

3311
02:31:17,819 --> 02:31:20,940
and fruit production

3312
02:31:18,720 --> 02:31:23,520
so fruit production fruits are a huge

3313
02:31:20,940 --> 02:31:25,501
sink of carbohydrates so when it does

3314
02:31:23,521 --> 02:31:26,820
this and I'll show you pictures in the

3315
02:31:25,501 --> 02:31:29,220
next slide apples tend to produce

3316
02:31:26,819 --> 02:31:31,800
thousands of flowers when they are

3317
02:31:29,220 --> 02:31:33,720
blooming so it puts so much of its

3318
02:31:31,800 --> 02:31:35,609
carbohydrates into making those fruit

3319
02:31:33,720 --> 02:31:37,229
that it needs so that it doesn't

3320
02:31:35,610 --> 02:31:38,551
actually produce the flower buds needed

3321
02:31:37,229 --> 02:31:41,100
for the next year because they initiate

3322
02:31:38,550 --> 02:31:44,581
that the year before so they almost need

3323
02:31:41,101 --> 02:31:46,891
that rest period to re-establish its

3324
02:31:44,581 --> 02:31:49,201
internal carbohydrate reserves the

3325
02:31:46,890 --> 02:31:51,540
second theory is as you can see from the

3326
02:31:49,200 --> 02:31:54,660
graph right here involving plant hormone

3327
02:31:51,540 --> 02:31:56,581
balance so one of them is the inhibition

3328
02:31:54,661 --> 02:32:00,261
of flower bud initiation and that is

3329
02:31:56,581 --> 02:32:02,790
done in the seeds right here and they

3330
02:32:00,261 --> 02:32:06,171
single gibberellins gibberellins are a

3331
02:32:02,790 --> 02:32:09,359
flower bud inhibitor so when a tree is

3332
02:32:06,171 --> 02:32:10,921
absolutely loaded with fruit it's also

3333
02:32:09,360 --> 02:32:12,601
loaded with a lot of maturing seats

3334
02:32:10,921 --> 02:32:14,640
which means that it has a lot of

3335
02:32:12,601 --> 02:32:15,871
gibberellin being produced and during

3336
02:32:14,640 --> 02:32:18,149
those years there's not that much leaf

3337
02:32:15,870 --> 02:32:22,728
production and I say that because leaves

3338
02:32:18,149 --> 02:32:24,709
are actually the cycle sorry about that

3339
02:32:22,728 --> 02:32:26,179
leaves are actually the initiation site

3340
02:32:24,709 --> 02:32:30,828
for something called Florida and Florida

3341
02:32:26,180 --> 02:32:32,300
actually initiates flower but initiation

3342
02:32:30,828 --> 02:32:34,158
so when you have a heavy crop load here

3343
02:32:32,299 --> 02:32:35,358
you don't have that many leaves so

3344
02:32:34,158 --> 02:32:36,978
you're getting the trees getting

3345
02:32:35,359 --> 02:32:38,300
overloaded with gibberellins therefore

3346
02:32:36,978 --> 02:32:40,578
it's not going to initiate new flower

3347
02:32:38,299 --> 02:32:42,108
buds for the next year on the other year

3348
02:32:40,578 --> 02:32:44,600
the off year it has a lot more

3349
02:32:42,109 --> 02:32:46,578
vegetation by comparison so it's going

3350
02:32:44,600 --> 02:32:49,340
to be saying okay initiate loss and lots

3351
02:32:46,578 --> 02:32:52,158
of flower buds so that's why we get

3352
02:32:49,340 --> 02:32:54,559
things we get something in called an on

3353
02:32:52,158 --> 02:32:57,738
and off year for trees and that way you

3354
02:32:54,559 --> 02:32:59,748
don't get consistent crops for culinary

3355
02:32:57,738 --> 02:33:02,779
apples there has been methods of taking

3356
02:32:59,748 --> 02:33:04,670
care of this so what they want to

3357
02:33:02,779 --> 02:33:05,960
prevent is this right here so you can

3358
02:33:04,670 --> 02:33:07,639
see this is a picture I took from the

3359
02:33:05,959 --> 02:33:10,488
angry orchard research and development

3360
02:33:07,639 --> 02:33:12,019
orchard in Walden New York and the tree

3361
02:33:10,488 --> 02:33:14,389
is starting to become overloaded for

3362
02:33:12,020 --> 02:33:19,100
flowers and it's not taken care of it

3363
02:33:14,389 --> 02:33:19,519
can be overloaded with fruits and there

3364
02:33:19,100 --> 02:33:21,649
we go

3365
02:33:19,520 --> 02:33:23,479
overloaded with fruit and not really be

3366
02:33:21,648 --> 02:33:25,818
able to go to the next year so what

3367
02:33:23,478 --> 02:33:26,658
Apple farmers do for culinary apples

3368
02:33:25,818 --> 02:33:28,609
which is what you buy at the grocery

3369
02:33:26,658 --> 02:33:32,090
store is they'll go through thinning

3370
02:33:28,609 --> 02:33:34,100
practices so the quality that those

3371
02:33:32,090 --> 02:33:35,658
apple farmers want is different than

3372
02:33:34,100 --> 02:33:37,988
what you get in cider apples so they go

3373
02:33:35,658 --> 02:33:40,189
through something like this so for

3374
02:33:37,988 --> 02:33:41,689
culinary apples the to quality the

3375
02:33:40,189 --> 02:33:43,998
qualities are looking for R is related

3376
02:33:41,689 --> 02:33:47,898
to fruit size and the overall appearance

3377
02:33:43,998 --> 02:33:49,459
of it so here fruit size and yield are

3378
02:33:47,898 --> 02:33:51,498
inversely related so the larger the

3379
02:33:49,459 --> 02:33:53,988
fruit the lower the yield the more yield

3380
02:33:51,498 --> 02:33:55,488
the smaller the fruit so they're trying

3381
02:33:53,988 --> 02:33:57,698
to get the most bang for their buck and

3382
02:33:55,488 --> 02:33:59,840
trying to find that nice middle ground

3383
02:33:57,699 --> 02:34:01,489
economically for them which can be shown

3384
02:33:59,840 --> 02:34:03,889
in this growth in this curve right here

3385
02:34:01,488 --> 02:34:05,898
so Apple farmers want to go right and

3386
02:34:03,889 --> 02:34:08,420
from here they're producing culinary

3387
02:34:05,898 --> 02:34:10,998
apples to actually make it profitable

3388
02:34:08,420 --> 02:34:13,639
all apple farmers are taught this though

3389
02:34:10,998 --> 02:34:16,369
the problem being this doesn't work the

3390
02:34:13,639 --> 02:34:17,689
same way for cider apples because you're

3391
02:34:16,369 --> 02:34:18,770
looking for something different when it

3392
02:34:17,689 --> 02:34:20,238
comes to quality you're not exactly

3393
02:34:18,770 --> 02:34:21,920
looking for size you're looking for

3394
02:34:20,238 --> 02:34:24,648
other components and the physiology

3395
02:34:21,920 --> 02:34:26,539
isn't quite the same so that's where dr.

3396
02:34:24,648 --> 02:34:28,189
Greg pecks research comes in is trying

3397
02:34:26,539 --> 02:34:29,479
to find out how to get rid of that

3398
02:34:28,189 --> 02:34:31,578
biennial bearing and maintain the

3399
02:34:29,478 --> 02:34:33,170
qualities needed for cider apples so

3400
02:34:31,578 --> 02:34:34,788
this part of the part that I was

3401
02:34:33,170 --> 02:34:35,780
involved in was done at the linn open

3402
02:34:34,789 --> 02:34:37,670
farm and Medina

3403
02:34:35,780 --> 02:34:39,021
York and here is the Oaks family who are

3404
02:34:37,670 --> 02:34:41,780
gracious enough to let us conduct the

3405
02:34:39,021 --> 02:34:43,190
experiment there and while there we use

3406
02:34:41,780 --> 02:34:45,739
eight different hard cider apple

3407
02:34:43,190 --> 02:34:48,829
varieties we use chisel Jersey Michelin

3408
02:34:45,739 --> 02:34:51,649
been a Roush dab Annette hairy master

3409
02:34:48,829 --> 02:34:53,060
Jersey trim lights bitter Garlington

3410
02:34:51,649 --> 02:34:54,529
mill and brown snap these are all

3411
02:34:53,060 --> 02:34:57,709
European varieties that have been well

3412
02:34:54,530 --> 02:34:59,840
known to make good parts so the

3413
02:34:57,709 --> 02:35:01,189
experiment this is only one of three but

3414
02:34:59,840 --> 02:35:04,280
this is what I was involved with was

3415
02:35:01,190 --> 02:35:06,890
crop low density and tree development so

3416
02:35:04,280 --> 02:35:10,190
what we are doing there is determining

3417
02:35:06,890 --> 02:35:12,279
the overall impact of tree growth on

3418
02:35:10,190 --> 02:35:15,500
crop load management because their own

3419
02:35:12,280 --> 02:35:17,090
closely correlated so in order to do

3420
02:35:15,500 --> 02:35:19,431
that we measured the trunk

3421
02:35:17,090 --> 02:35:22,130
cross-sectional area of the tree to get

3422
02:35:19,431 --> 02:35:25,399
a proxy for the overall tree size and

3423
02:35:22,129 --> 02:35:27,170
this was measured centimetres square so

3424
02:35:25,399 --> 02:35:28,819
we had two different controls and three

3425
02:35:27,170 --> 02:35:31,700
different treatments so the first

3426
02:35:28,819 --> 02:35:34,699
control was we didn't do anything to the

3427
02:35:31,700 --> 02:35:36,620
tree we just left it alone to see how it

3428
02:35:34,700 --> 02:35:38,840
would work the next one was we

3429
02:35:36,620 --> 02:35:40,370
completely stripped it of all fruits to

3430
02:35:38,840 --> 02:35:42,590
see how that would affect growth over

3431
02:35:40,370 --> 02:35:46,670
the years and then the next three was to

3432
02:35:42,590 --> 02:35:50,239
do a low crop load so basically three

3433
02:35:46,670 --> 02:35:52,420
apples per centimeter squared in the

3434
02:35:50,239 --> 02:35:56,780
tree and then we did a medium of six oh

3435
02:35:52,420 --> 02:35:59,239
hi a nine excuse me and from that we did

3436
02:35:56,780 --> 02:36:01,820
four single tree bugger it's randomized

3437
02:35:59,239 --> 02:36:03,500
per block and then we did ten fruit

3438
02:36:01,819 --> 02:36:04,851
samples from each replication to be

3439
02:36:03,500 --> 02:36:07,399
measured later on which will explain

3440
02:36:04,851 --> 02:36:11,000
what the measurements were and we based

3441
02:36:07,399 --> 02:36:12,979
the harvesting time off of maturity

3442
02:36:11,000 --> 02:36:15,190
assessments done by Craig kalki who is a

3443
02:36:12,979 --> 02:36:17,390
part of the Lake Ontario fruit program

3444
02:36:15,190 --> 02:36:18,710
so the measurements that we were going

3445
02:36:17,390 --> 02:36:22,539
for were two different things

3446
02:36:18,709 --> 02:36:24,589
in culinary apples you want to have a

3447
02:36:22,540 --> 02:36:25,700
little bit of starch left over in it

3448
02:36:24,590 --> 02:36:27,920
because culinary apples are actually

3449
02:36:25,700 --> 02:36:29,210
stored for a long period of time cider

3450
02:36:27,920 --> 02:36:31,431
apples are very different

3451
02:36:29,209 --> 02:36:33,049
you actually want them to be harvested

3452
02:36:31,431 --> 02:36:34,880
Colts the rightness as possible because

3453
02:36:33,049 --> 02:36:36,709
they're not usually stored there usually

3454
02:36:34,879 --> 02:36:38,479
press immediately to have juice you want

3455
02:36:36,709 --> 02:36:39,949
to have different components so that's

3456
02:36:38,479 --> 02:36:42,409
why we're doing things like measuring

3457
02:36:39,950 --> 02:36:43,880
fruit maturity the starch pattern index

3458
02:36:42,409 --> 02:36:45,560
the fruit permanence and the total

3459
02:36:43,879 --> 02:36:47,479
soluble cells to measure the sugars and

3460
02:36:45,560 --> 02:36:49,469
everything else involved trying to get

3461
02:36:47,479 --> 02:36:53,488
it so we can get as much

3462
02:36:49,469 --> 02:36:55,260
needed so dr. Greg pecks lab also

3463
02:36:53,488 --> 02:36:56,818
measured the cider quality those things

3464
02:36:55,260 --> 02:36:59,010
like pH titratable

3465
02:36:56,818 --> 02:37:01,498
acid the phenolic contact the ease of

3466
02:36:59,010 --> 02:37:02,699
cinebulle nitrogen things that are very

3467
02:37:01,498 --> 02:37:04,680
important where you're going through a

3468
02:37:02,699 --> 02:37:06,479
fermentation process is it going to be

3469
02:37:04,680 --> 02:37:08,189
the right pH for the fermentation for

3470
02:37:06,478 --> 02:37:09,748
the yeast to survive are we going to

3471
02:37:08,189 --> 02:37:11,130
have the needed phenolic compounds and

3472
02:37:09,748 --> 02:37:12,958
the acids to actually create the

3473
02:37:11,129 --> 02:37:14,488
complexity that we want is there gonna

3474
02:37:12,959 --> 02:37:15,959
be enough nitrogen there for the yeast

3475
02:37:14,488 --> 02:37:18,180
to do what it needs to because it needs

3476
02:37:15,959 --> 02:37:19,920
the nitrogen in order to form an ferment

3477
02:37:18,180 --> 02:37:21,600
properly or are we gonna have to do a

3478
02:37:19,920 --> 02:37:22,648
lot of additions in order for it to go

3479
02:37:21,600 --> 02:37:26,550
according to plan

3480
02:37:22,648 --> 02:37:28,948
for what the cider that we want so based

3481
02:37:26,549 --> 02:37:32,009
on of all of this this is just the

3482
02:37:28,949 --> 02:37:34,709
beginning of the project so we just

3483
02:37:32,010 --> 02:37:36,539
recently within the last month started

3484
02:37:34,709 --> 02:37:38,550
actually Reece looking over the results

3485
02:37:36,539 --> 02:37:40,709
and everything else so this is gonna be

3486
02:37:38,549 --> 02:37:42,840
going on for a longer so the outcomes

3487
02:37:40,709 --> 02:37:44,699
and expected benefits of this are to

3488
02:37:42,840 --> 02:37:46,350
provide cultivar specific crop load

3489
02:37:44,699 --> 02:37:47,789
recommendations to assist growers

3490
02:37:46,350 --> 02:37:49,680
because they are different than what a

3491
02:37:47,789 --> 02:37:52,020
lot of apple growers are used to and to

3492
02:37:49,680 --> 02:37:54,180
provide cultivar specific harvest index

3493
02:37:52,020 --> 02:37:56,449
recommendations so they have an idea of

3494
02:37:54,180 --> 02:37:58,470
when to harvest for what they have and

3495
02:37:56,449 --> 02:38:01,739
to finish it off I would like to

3496
02:37:58,469 --> 02:38:04,438
encourage dr. Greg Peck right there and

3497
02:38:01,738 --> 02:38:06,538
right there with the other interns that

3498
02:38:04,439 --> 02:38:09,209
I worked with last year I would also

3499
02:38:06,539 --> 02:38:12,840
like to thank dr. Marvin Pritz who

3500
02:38:09,209 --> 02:38:14,130
actually got me on to the fruit orchard

3501
02:38:12,840 --> 02:38:16,350
internship because I was actually his

3502
02:38:14,129 --> 02:38:18,208
intern we help each other a lot with

3503
02:38:16,350 --> 02:38:19,800
different researchers I'd like to thank

3504
02:38:18,209 --> 02:38:21,300
Craig kalki who worked with Cornell

3505
02:38:19,799 --> 02:38:23,519
Cooperative Extension and the Lake

3506
02:38:21,299 --> 02:38:25,408
Ontario program and I'd also like to

3507
02:38:23,520 --> 02:38:27,119
thank in New York State apple growers in

3508
02:38:25,408 --> 02:38:29,609
the Apple research development program

3509
02:38:27,119 --> 02:38:40,680
who helped fund this project and I'll be

3510
02:38:29,609 --> 02:38:44,309
willing to take any questions I was

3511
02:38:40,680 --> 02:38:48,600
tempted I'm not sure how well that would

3512
02:38:44,309 --> 02:38:56,430
have gone support New York apple cider

3513
02:38:48,600 --> 02:38:58,050
makers I presentation so I am also

3514
02:38:56,430 --> 02:39:01,680
really interested in the biennial

3515
02:38:58,049 --> 02:39:03,180
bearing problem and one way that I've

3516
02:39:01,680 --> 02:39:06,271
seen on to control

3517
02:39:03,181 --> 02:39:09,681
crop load um is to examine I think what

3518
02:39:06,271 --> 02:39:13,650
they call the spur extinction rates on

3519
02:39:09,681 --> 02:39:16,319
spur extinction rates okay so basically

3520
02:39:13,649 --> 02:39:18,149
how often do these sedatives first

3521
02:39:16,319 --> 02:39:19,560
disappear and they don't produce flowers

3522
02:39:18,149 --> 02:39:21,841
anymore so I was just curious in terms

3523
02:39:19,560 --> 02:39:24,931
of cider production are there a lot of

3524
02:39:21,841 --> 02:39:27,511
genetic resources of specific genotypes

3525
02:39:24,931 --> 02:39:30,480
that have this characteristic and which

3526
02:39:27,511 --> 02:39:39,899
we might be able to exploit I'm gonna be

3527
02:39:30,479 --> 02:39:41,279
honest I'm not sure I'm not sure how

3528
02:39:39,899 --> 02:39:42,720
much genetic research has been done for

3529
02:39:41,280 --> 02:39:44,431
hard cider apples there's been a renew

3530
02:39:42,720 --> 02:39:46,229
interest and looking into the genetics

3531
02:39:44,431 --> 02:39:48,721
and actually start breeding for more

3532
02:39:46,229 --> 02:39:50,880
hard cider varieties I know we know that

3533
02:39:48,720 --> 02:39:53,100
more for culinary apples but if there's

3534
02:39:50,880 --> 02:39:55,020
research out there I'm not sure how much

3535
02:39:53,101 --> 02:39:57,060
there is that's probably not based here

3536
02:39:55,021 --> 02:39:58,471
but I think there's actually a growing

3537
02:39:57,060 --> 02:39:59,851
interest in looking into things like

3538
02:39:58,470 --> 02:40:05,091
that and there will be more research on

3539
02:39:59,851 --> 02:40:05,091
it other questions okay

3540
02:40:09,139 --> 02:40:14,920
[Applause]

3541
02:40:17,180 --> 02:40:25,620
all right our next speaker is Nellie

3542
02:40:21,120 --> 02:40:27,540
roach and today what there's some

3543
02:40:25,620 --> 02:40:29,640
feedback or something today Natalie will

3544
02:40:27,540 --> 02:40:34,620
be talking about spreading the word on

3545
02:40:29,639 --> 02:40:36,539
plant nutrition and sprouts all right

3546
02:40:34,620 --> 02:40:39,630
thank you for that Chris all right hi

3547
02:40:36,540 --> 02:40:41,040
guys I'm Natalie and I had an internship

3548
02:40:39,629 --> 02:40:42,750
this past winter with Cornell

3549
02:40:41,040 --> 02:40:44,811
Cooperative Extension in Seneca County

3550
02:40:42,750 --> 02:40:47,129
I'm also a plant science major

3551
02:40:44,810 --> 02:40:49,379
concentrating in plants in human health

3552
02:40:47,129 --> 02:40:51,239
so a little bit of background on Cornell

3553
02:40:49,379 --> 02:40:53,699
Cooperative Extension the smith-lever

3554
02:40:51,239 --> 02:40:56,340
act was passed in 1914 by President

3555
02:40:53,700 --> 02:40:59,311
Woodrow Wilson and this wasn't created

3556
02:40:56,340 --> 02:41:01,409
to create all these property extensions

3557
02:40:59,310 --> 02:41:03,360
connected to land right universities in

3558
02:41:01,409 --> 02:41:05,789
order to inform individuals on new

3559
02:41:03,360 --> 02:41:08,720
agricultural practices home economic and

3560
02:41:05,790 --> 02:41:12,240
policy changes so this could involve

3561
02:41:08,719 --> 02:41:13,770
different farmers that just want to be

3562
02:41:12,239 --> 02:41:15,959
very updated on new agricultural

3563
02:41:13,771 --> 02:41:17,610
policies or techniques or it could just

3564
02:41:15,959 --> 02:41:20,219
be merely community members that want to

3565
02:41:17,610 --> 02:41:22,079
just kind of have more insight onto what

3566
02:41:20,219 --> 02:41:23,819
we're learning agriculturally or from

3567
02:41:22,079 --> 02:41:25,021
Cornell or other land-grant universities

3568
02:41:23,819 --> 02:41:27,029
so this is the idea of taking the

3569
02:41:25,021 --> 02:41:28,530
university to the people and kind of

3570
02:41:27,030 --> 02:41:31,290
spreading them spreading the word if you

3571
02:41:28,530 --> 02:41:34,050
will so some of the benefits of Cornell

3572
02:41:31,290 --> 02:41:36,660
Cooperative Extension since 1914 they've

3573
02:41:34,049 --> 02:41:38,219
expanded a little now involved

3574
02:41:36,659 --> 02:41:40,170
things like life skills nutrition and

3575
02:41:38,219 --> 02:41:43,049
health informing people on different

3576
02:41:40,170 --> 02:41:45,870
agriculture sustainability environmental

3577
02:41:43,049 --> 02:41:47,279
education and even job skills and this

3578
02:41:45,870 --> 02:41:49,380
is all with the promise of an unbiased

3579
02:41:47,280 --> 02:41:51,659
research so all this research comes from

3580
02:41:49,379 --> 02:41:55,679
either Cornell or on other land-grant

3581
02:41:51,659 --> 02:41:58,860
universities and all of these can be

3582
02:41:55,680 --> 02:42:00,930
done in a community workshop setting so

3583
02:41:58,860 --> 02:42:02,130
as seen here this is kind of more of a

3584
02:42:00,930 --> 02:42:04,500
community setting this one is actually

3585
02:42:02,129 --> 02:42:05,670
in Essex County and this was all growers

3586
02:42:04,500 --> 02:42:07,799
and fellow farmers they're learning

3587
02:42:05,670 --> 02:42:11,100
different techniques on cherry tomato

3588
02:42:07,799 --> 02:42:12,659
and pepper propagation or it can also be

3589
02:42:11,100 --> 02:42:13,860
done one on one if you want to just have

3590
02:42:12,659 --> 02:42:15,299
a one-on-one meeting and learn about

3591
02:42:13,860 --> 02:42:17,220
these things they're also experimenting

3592
02:42:15,299 --> 02:42:19,229
now as some like webinar and Skype type

3593
02:42:17,219 --> 02:42:21,179
of things they're expanding even their

3594
02:42:19,229 --> 02:42:23,340
ability to get this information across

3595
02:42:21,180 --> 02:42:24,720
to different people so although most of

3596
02:42:23,340 --> 02:42:26,549
these are for adults they also have a

3597
02:42:24,719 --> 02:42:27,689
youth development program so it's with a

3598
02:42:26,549 --> 02:42:30,199
bunch of kids that can do summer

3599
02:42:27,690 --> 02:42:32,360
programs cookouts and just learn to

3600
02:42:30,200 --> 02:42:34,909
things about agriculture and other

3601
02:42:32,360 --> 02:42:36,739
policies so here's a couple of these

3602
02:42:34,909 --> 02:42:39,559
examples here's a 4-h program with

3603
02:42:36,739 --> 02:42:42,139
children they're doing cookout here

3604
02:42:39,559 --> 02:42:43,369
here we are is a lecture style classroom

3605
02:42:42,139 --> 02:42:45,170
setting which would actually the two

3606
02:42:43,370 --> 02:42:48,229
workshops I participated in row but in

3607
02:42:45,170 --> 02:42:50,629
that style here's a maple syrup workshop

3608
02:42:48,228 --> 02:42:52,579
actually which is really cool

3609
02:42:50,629 --> 02:42:54,769
um and here is Cornell Cooperative

3610
02:42:52,579 --> 02:42:56,450
Extension at the farmers market so

3611
02:42:54,770 --> 02:42:57,920
they're kind of telling different people

3612
02:42:56,450 --> 02:42:59,450
that are interested in the vegetables on

3613
02:42:57,920 --> 02:43:00,590
different ways they grew then and just

3614
02:42:59,450 --> 02:43:04,010
giving them a little bit of knowledge on

3615
02:43:00,590 --> 02:43:05,659
their food so my work in Cornell

3616
02:43:04,010 --> 02:43:08,540
Cooperative Extension in Seneca County

3617
02:43:05,659 --> 02:43:10,309
and I worked with Moira tee-ball and

3618
02:43:08,540 --> 02:43:13,520
Susan Pearson who were two CCE

3619
02:43:10,309 --> 02:43:16,159
nutritional educators and so what coming

3620
02:43:13,520 --> 02:43:19,790
into it my two frog my two workshops we

3621
02:43:16,159 --> 02:43:21,350
decided to do something based on plant

3622
02:43:19,790 --> 02:43:23,240
nutrition and since it's really hard to

3623
02:43:21,350 --> 02:43:24,620
get access to vegetables during the

3624
02:43:23,239 --> 02:43:27,680
winter months like there's not many

3625
02:43:24,620 --> 02:43:29,329
farmers market or not access to local

3626
02:43:27,680 --> 02:43:32,479
things so we thought that we'd create

3627
02:43:29,329 --> 02:43:34,340
two workshops that people could grow

3628
02:43:32,478 --> 02:43:35,899
some plants in their own home so I did a

3629
02:43:34,340 --> 02:43:37,430
sprouts workshop where we taught people

3630
02:43:35,899 --> 02:43:40,939
how to grow sprouts indoors just in your

3631
02:43:37,430 --> 02:43:43,309
windowsill as well as a herb herb

3632
02:43:40,939 --> 02:43:45,439
workshop at a let's start in day

3633
02:43:43,309 --> 02:43:47,090
teaching people how to you just grow

3634
02:43:45,439 --> 02:43:48,920
some herbs the potential benefit or you

3635
02:43:47,090 --> 02:43:51,620
can just put it in your winch window so

3636
02:43:48,920 --> 02:43:54,620
and then translate it into your garden

3637
02:43:51,620 --> 02:43:57,290
in the spring so why do we choose

3638
02:43:54,620 --> 02:43:59,390
sprouts specifically so sprouts contain

3639
02:43:57,290 --> 02:43:59,990
a really concentrated amount of vitamins

3640
02:43:59,389 --> 02:44:02,059
and minerals

3641
02:43:59,989 --> 02:44:03,680
it's the sheet of the plant with usually

3642
02:44:02,059 --> 02:44:05,869
some two cotyledons

3643
02:44:03,680 --> 02:44:07,430
on it and it has a really packed amount

3644
02:44:05,870 --> 02:44:09,590
of vitamins and minerals it's also

3645
02:44:07,430 --> 02:44:11,510
really low in calories and it's a good

3646
02:44:09,590 --> 02:44:12,829
way to add some flavor into dishes so if

3647
02:44:11,510 --> 02:44:14,630
you have something like a radish sprout

3648
02:44:12,829 --> 02:44:16,639
which is really spicy and you want to

3649
02:44:14,629 --> 02:44:18,319
flavor up your salad or stir-fry it for

3650
02:44:16,639 --> 02:44:19,899
me you can toss those in there get the

3651
02:44:18,319 --> 02:44:21,770
nutritional benefits as well as flavor

3652
02:44:19,899 --> 02:44:24,978
also some of them have really good

3653
02:44:21,770 --> 02:44:27,590
textures as well I can be like crunchy

3654
02:44:24,978 --> 02:44:28,670
they're also organic fresh and they can

3655
02:44:27,590 --> 02:44:29,750
be grown all year round if you're

3656
02:44:28,670 --> 02:44:31,549
growing them right near home and

3657
02:44:29,750 --> 02:44:33,439
something that I found was really cool

3658
02:44:31,549 --> 02:44:35,029
dr. Clive McKay who was a Cornell

3659
02:44:33,439 --> 02:44:36,800
nutrition professor and during World War

3660
02:44:35,030 --> 02:44:40,939
two was the one who actually brought the

3661
02:44:36,799 --> 02:44:42,769
idea of sprouts to the public eye so my

3662
02:44:40,939 --> 02:44:43,909
sprouts research process I was

3663
02:44:42,770 --> 02:44:45,319
researching different primary

3664
02:44:43,909 --> 02:44:48,909
articles from Cornell or other outside

3665
02:44:45,319 --> 02:44:51,140
universities looking at the different

3666
02:44:48,909 --> 02:44:53,149
nutritional benefits and growth time

3667
02:44:51,140 --> 02:44:54,680
flavor and then putting this all

3668
02:44:53,149 --> 02:44:56,810
together in a giant chart so you can

3669
02:44:54,680 --> 02:44:59,030
kind of pick whatever you're wanting to

3670
02:44:56,810 --> 02:45:00,529
have and grow those specifically or

3671
02:44:59,030 --> 02:45:02,210
whatever you're looking for whether that

3672
02:45:00,530 --> 02:45:04,610
was flavor or texture just certain

3673
02:45:02,209 --> 02:45:08,020
vitamins for the ones that we focused on

3674
02:45:04,610 --> 02:45:11,930
was radish broccoli chickpeas lentils

3675
02:45:08,021 --> 02:45:13,370
cabbage and mustard seed sprouts I also

3676
02:45:11,930 --> 02:45:15,560
researched a bunch of the USDA

3677
02:45:13,370 --> 02:45:17,360
nutritional data that consumers might

3678
02:45:15,560 --> 02:45:19,760
find important such as protein amounts

3679
02:45:17,360 --> 02:45:21,351
for example a half a cup of chickpeas

3680
02:45:19,760 --> 02:45:23,750
sprouts which is not very much it all

3681
02:45:21,351 --> 02:45:25,579
has the equivalent protein of four eggs

3682
02:45:23,750 --> 02:45:27,351
so that's really great someone for like

3683
02:45:25,579 --> 02:45:28,549
a vegan or vegetarian where to know that

3684
02:45:27,351 --> 02:45:31,730
and they can coorporate that into their

3685
02:45:28,549 --> 02:45:33,890
meals and get enough protein so the

3686
02:45:31,729 --> 02:45:35,569
sprouts workshop was presented in the

3687
02:45:33,890 --> 02:45:37,219
beginning of January at the Cornell

3688
02:45:35,569 --> 02:45:39,289
Cooperative Extension office in Seneca

3689
02:45:37,219 --> 02:45:41,000
County and I told people a little bit

3690
02:45:39,290 --> 02:45:43,391
about what our sprouts on their

3691
02:45:41,000 --> 02:45:46,040
different nutritional medicinal benefits

3692
02:45:43,390 --> 02:45:47,989
the nutritional benefits focused a lot

3693
02:45:46,040 --> 02:45:50,811
on these vitamins right here the holy I

3694
02:45:47,989 --> 02:45:52,430
didn't even a vitamin C an iron and then

3695
02:45:50,810 --> 02:45:53,810
I also incorporate some of the medicinal

3696
02:45:52,430 --> 02:45:55,489
benefits that some of these sprouts may

3697
02:45:53,810 --> 02:45:56,750
have for example like if they had really

3698
02:45:55,489 --> 02:45:58,760
high levels of glucosinolates

3699
02:45:56,750 --> 02:46:00,649
which can accent anti-cancer compounds

3700
02:45:58,760 --> 02:46:01,700
or if they aided in digestion or

3701
02:46:00,649 --> 02:46:04,219
something like that you can incorporate

3702
02:46:01,700 --> 02:46:06,200
all these medicinal benefits in with

3703
02:46:04,219 --> 02:46:07,699
these different sprouts and one of the

3704
02:46:06,200 --> 02:46:08,930
questions someone had was why would I

3705
02:46:07,700 --> 02:46:10,579
want to eat these sprouts for these

3706
02:46:08,930 --> 02:46:13,130
vitamins instead of just taking a

3707
02:46:10,579 --> 02:46:15,021
dietary supplement am i intended I was

3708
02:46:13,129 --> 02:46:17,270
that these sprouts contain like a bunch

3709
02:46:15,021 --> 02:46:19,311
of different of these compounds and

3710
02:46:17,271 --> 02:46:22,190
these vitamins and that although they

3711
02:46:19,310 --> 02:46:23,479
might may may only provide the I guess

3712
02:46:22,190 --> 02:46:25,790
if you could take a bunch of the dietary

3713
02:46:23,479 --> 02:46:26,930
supplements they kind of come together

3714
02:46:25,790 --> 02:46:29,601
in different things with also

3715
02:46:26,930 --> 02:46:31,399
micronutrients they complexly break down

3716
02:46:29,601 --> 02:46:34,310
in your body where's one vitamin may

3717
02:46:31,399 --> 02:46:35,920
have a role in absorption of another and

3718
02:46:34,310 --> 02:46:38,750
they also have different compounds like

3719
02:46:35,920 --> 02:46:40,340
antioxidants may be anti-inflammatory

3720
02:46:38,750 --> 02:46:41,719
antimicrobial all of those kind of

3721
02:46:40,340 --> 02:46:42,140
compounds well that work within your

3722
02:46:41,719 --> 02:46:43,640
body

3723
02:46:42,140 --> 02:46:47,149
the dietary supplements may not provide

3724
02:46:43,640 --> 02:46:50,359
you and then Moira did Bal who is one of

3725
02:46:47,149 --> 02:46:52,190
my one of the CCE nutritional educators

3726
02:46:50,360 --> 02:46:54,021
presented on how to actually grow these

3727
02:46:52,190 --> 02:46:56,069
sprouts so you can go the media like a

3728
02:46:54,021 --> 02:46:57,989
colander like up here

3729
02:46:56,069 --> 02:46:59,879
there's these trades down here and then

3730
02:46:57,989 --> 02:47:01,649
Thiessen you bought at country time

3731
02:46:59,879 --> 02:47:03,420
which is kind of up by at room very over

3732
02:47:01,649 --> 02:47:04,590
there so it's like a bunch of different

3733
02:47:03,420 --> 02:47:05,700
ways you can grow these sprouts right in

3734
02:47:04,590 --> 02:47:08,280
your windowsill and then there was a

3735
02:47:05,700 --> 02:47:09,720
mason jar in the previous slide that you

3736
02:47:08,280 --> 02:47:11,570
can put right in your windowsill and you

3737
02:47:09,719 --> 02:47:13,709
just wash it once a day it's super easy

3738
02:47:11,569 --> 02:47:16,289
so she presented a little bit and then

3739
02:47:13,709 --> 02:47:18,539
all of our workshop attendees it was

3740
02:47:16,290 --> 02:47:20,820
about 25 30 people got to leave with a

3741
02:47:18,540 --> 02:47:23,390
mason jar a filter a bunch of sprouts

3742
02:47:20,819 --> 02:47:25,649
and some sprout seeds to start their own

3743
02:47:23,389 --> 02:47:26,670
so some of the health concerns that have

3744
02:47:25,649 --> 02:47:28,520
been kind of in the news recently

3745
02:47:26,670 --> 02:47:31,680
especially a new case of Jimmy John's

3746
02:47:28,521 --> 02:47:34,170
sandwich shop was with presence of E

3747
02:47:31,680 --> 02:47:35,639
coli and Salmonella while growing these

3748
02:47:34,170 --> 02:47:37,139
sprouts because of sprouts growing

3749
02:47:35,639 --> 02:47:39,539
environment is very conducive for these

3750
02:47:37,139 --> 02:47:42,719
bacteria since it's warm moist and

3751
02:47:39,540 --> 02:47:44,850
everything's very close together so the

3752
02:47:42,719 --> 02:47:46,260
FDA suggests that you cook your sprouts

3753
02:47:44,850 --> 02:47:48,329
before you eat them to get rid of these

3754
02:47:46,260 --> 02:47:50,579
bacteria however people don't usually

3755
02:47:48,329 --> 02:47:52,799
eat cooked sprouts usually eat them raw

3756
02:47:50,579 --> 02:47:54,420
in a salad or sandwich or something so

3757
02:47:52,799 --> 02:47:55,829
if you watch them for two minutes and

3758
02:47:54,420 --> 02:47:57,120
kind of a mechanical process of washing

3759
02:47:55,829 --> 02:47:59,430
it helps to get rid of some of that

3760
02:47:57,120 --> 02:48:00,990
bacteria or if you do want to try to

3761
02:47:59,430 --> 02:48:02,430
cook it to kill these but you don't want

3762
02:48:00,989 --> 02:48:03,899
to lose all of those vitamins and

3763
02:48:02,430 --> 02:48:06,210
minerals that may break down in the

3764
02:48:03,899 --> 02:48:07,649
heating process it's suggested to

3765
02:48:06,209 --> 02:48:09,839
actually steam them and I guess that

3766
02:48:07,649 --> 02:48:11,579
that retains a lot of those compounds

3767
02:48:09,840 --> 02:48:12,780
without actually and then you kind of

3768
02:48:11,579 --> 02:48:15,569
could see them and kill some of the

3769
02:48:12,780 --> 02:48:17,820
bacteria also to refrigerate them after

3770
02:48:15,569 --> 02:48:19,139
you harvest your sprouts to decrease the

3771
02:48:17,819 --> 02:48:22,260
problems those bacteria and if they

3772
02:48:19,139 --> 02:48:23,729
smell musty have dark buds or look slimy

3773
02:48:22,260 --> 02:48:27,600
and don't consume them kind of like in

3774
02:48:23,729 --> 02:48:30,350
this picture right here so for the

3775
02:48:27,600 --> 02:48:35,370
second workshop which was on March 18th

3776
02:48:30,350 --> 02:48:37,800
was presented at the Ovid at Firehouse

3777
02:48:35,370 --> 02:48:40,560
and it was there the lecture today so we

3778
02:48:37,799 --> 02:48:41,939
I researched a bunch of different small

3779
02:48:40,559 --> 02:48:44,250
herbs that are local when people are

3780
02:48:41,940 --> 02:48:46,980
familiar with the lavender parsley dill

3781
02:48:44,250 --> 02:48:48,659
cilantro basil and mint and those kind

3782
02:48:46,979 --> 02:48:50,819
of have varying properties summer uses

3783
02:48:48,659 --> 02:48:54,539
I'm seasoning and dishes other confusing

3784
02:48:50,819 --> 02:48:57,600
as inhalation therapy with lavender for

3785
02:48:54,540 --> 02:49:00,330
like stress relief some can be used in

3786
02:48:57,600 --> 02:49:01,380
drinks like mint and so I talked a bit

3787
02:49:00,329 --> 02:49:03,120
about the nutritional and medicinal

3788
02:49:01,379 --> 02:49:05,039
properties of those as well and they

3789
02:49:03,120 --> 02:49:07,800
also had kind of similar vitamins and

3790
02:49:05,040 --> 02:49:10,200
minerals and also their medicinal

3791
02:49:07,799 --> 02:49:12,429
properties

3792
02:49:10,200 --> 02:49:15,040
such as lavender with the inhalation

3793
02:49:12,430 --> 02:49:17,710
therapy helped with anxiety and helps

3794
02:49:15,040 --> 02:49:19,600
you sleep I guess at night so then Susan

3795
02:49:17,709 --> 02:49:21,759
Peterson which was also one of the CCE

3796
02:49:19,600 --> 02:49:23,530
educators talked a little bit about how

3797
02:49:21,760 --> 02:49:25,210
to grow these certain do's and don'ts of

3798
02:49:23,530 --> 02:49:28,960
planting these herbs some potential

3799
02:49:25,209 --> 02:49:30,250
threats from pests or maybe if you were

3800
02:49:28,959 --> 02:49:32,319
to water them too frequently what would

3801
02:49:30,250 --> 02:49:33,879
happen so just kind of suggestions for

3802
02:49:32,319 --> 02:49:35,619
its people there were fellow gardeners

3803
02:49:33,879 --> 02:49:37,719
though so usually this was given I'm a

3804
02:49:35,620 --> 02:49:39,340
little bit higher of a scientific level

3805
02:49:37,719 --> 02:49:41,770
than the general audience that was

3806
02:49:39,340 --> 02:49:43,030
presented for the sprouts workshop we

3807
02:49:41,771 --> 02:49:44,590
also talked about some preservation and

3808
02:49:43,030 --> 02:49:46,030
recipes so like you can freeze herbs

3809
02:49:44,590 --> 02:49:47,079
actually to kind of preserve their

3810
02:49:46,030 --> 02:49:49,150
freshness and then just use them

3811
02:49:47,079 --> 02:49:50,500
whenever you're cooking then we had a

3812
02:49:49,149 --> 02:49:51,819
bunch of different recipes we made with

3813
02:49:50,500 --> 02:49:52,899
them all these herbs and we're able to

3814
02:49:51,819 --> 02:49:55,840
give them out to people which is nice

3815
02:49:52,899 --> 02:49:57,609
and then had some precautions that these

3816
02:49:55,840 --> 02:49:59,229
herbs if you're using them for medicinal

3817
02:49:57,610 --> 02:50:00,579
purpose they can have certain side

3818
02:49:59,229 --> 02:50:02,379
effects or interact with another

3819
02:50:00,579 --> 02:50:04,539
medication you're taking so if you were

3820
02:50:02,379 --> 02:50:06,459
actually trying to take these herbs like

3821
02:50:04,540 --> 02:50:09,310
daily for a certain medical issue then

3822
02:50:06,459 --> 02:50:11,529
should consult a physician so this was

3823
02:50:09,309 --> 02:50:14,770
the let's garden day in Ovid and this is

3824
02:50:11,530 --> 02:50:16,300
the classroom setting so for all these

3825
02:50:14,771 --> 02:50:18,370
fellow gardeners is a really great

3826
02:50:16,299 --> 02:50:20,649
experience and it was with a bunch of

3827
02:50:18,370 --> 02:50:22,000
other people from Cornell as well as I

3828
02:50:20,649 --> 02:50:24,549
see that presented on different

3829
02:50:22,000 --> 02:50:26,021
gardening techniques or maybe some

3830
02:50:24,549 --> 02:50:30,279
pathogens or pests that may be in the

3831
02:50:26,021 --> 02:50:33,220
area and so I'd really like to thank the

3832
02:50:30,280 --> 02:50:36,310
CCE Seneca County office as well as

3833
02:50:33,219 --> 02:50:39,219
Morton ball and Susan Peterson and Patti

3834
02:50:36,309 --> 02:50:41,229
Battley who organized a Lexar today so

3835
02:50:39,219 --> 02:50:42,199
thank you so much and I will take any

3836
02:50:41,229 --> 02:50:47,310
questions

3837
02:50:42,200 --> 02:50:51,940
[Applause]

3838
02:50:47,310 --> 02:50:53,920
questions what's your favorite sprout

3839
02:50:51,940 --> 02:50:57,340
growing method and what's your favorite

3840
02:50:53,920 --> 02:50:59,079
sprout I think the trade method works

3841
02:50:57,340 --> 02:51:00,549
really really well we grew it on a

3842
02:50:59,079 --> 02:51:02,440
couple different rounds at sprouts while

3843
02:51:00,549 --> 02:51:03,579
I was working there in the trays it's

3844
02:51:02,440 --> 02:51:05,140
found hard to tell in that picture but

3845
02:51:03,579 --> 02:51:06,700
the trays have four different sections

3846
02:51:05,140 --> 02:51:09,100
you can go for different types of

3847
02:51:06,700 --> 02:51:10,240
sprouts in it just kind of nice so we

3848
02:51:09,101 --> 02:51:11,800
were like pass it out and whatever

3849
02:51:10,239 --> 02:51:13,060
you're kinda in the mood for like I like

3850
02:51:11,799 --> 02:51:15,310
the radish sprout the bestest is really

3851
02:51:13,060 --> 02:51:16,239
spicy so I thought that was great so you

3852
02:51:15,310 --> 02:51:17,649
could just kind of like take out

3853
02:51:16,239 --> 02:51:19,719
whatever sprouts you really wanted and

3854
02:51:17,649 --> 02:51:21,369
put them into the smoothie stir-fry

3855
02:51:19,719 --> 02:51:21,939
whatever you wanted so yeah that was

3856
02:51:21,370 --> 02:51:28,290
really cool

3857
02:51:21,940 --> 02:51:28,290
I don't want us other questions

3858
02:51:30,079 --> 02:51:37,148
[Applause]

3859
02:51:38,899 --> 02:51:45,139
okay the penultimate Speaker of the day

3860
02:51:48,799 --> 02:51:56,279
penultimate we can learn a new word and

3861
02:51:55,139 --> 02:52:01,500
ultimate it's a great word

3862
02:51:56,280 --> 02:52:04,560
second-to-last so Meghan Dodge is

3863
02:52:01,500 --> 02:52:07,139
speaking next and Meghan it will be

3864
02:52:04,559 --> 02:52:10,439
talking about her internship at the

3865
02:52:07,139 --> 02:52:12,989
Central Park Conservatory lessons in

3866
02:52:10,439 --> 02:52:17,489
urban park horticulture and management

3867
02:52:12,989 --> 02:52:19,110
thank you hi so I'm going into landscape

3868
02:52:17,489 --> 02:52:20,789
architectures this is going to be a

3869
02:52:19,110 --> 02:52:24,390
pretty different talk than the ones that

3870
02:52:20,790 --> 02:52:26,460
you've heard so far just to kind of set

3871
02:52:24,389 --> 02:52:28,889
the stage an overview of what Central

3872
02:52:26,459 --> 02:52:30,659
Park is and its origin it was designed

3873
02:52:28,889 --> 02:52:33,389
by Landscape Architect Frederick Law

3874
02:52:30,659 --> 02:52:37,020
Olmsted and architect Calvert Vaux in

3875
02:52:33,389 --> 02:52:38,789
1858 they want to design competition to

3876
02:52:37,020 --> 02:52:39,600
create this massive park in the middle

3877
02:52:38,790 --> 02:52:42,930
of Manhattan

3878
02:52:39,600 --> 02:52:44,880
it's 843 acres which is about six

3879
02:52:42,930 --> 02:52:47,489
percent of Manhattan's total acreage so

3880
02:52:44,879 --> 02:52:49,349
it's a pretty big deal and its design

3881
02:52:47,489 --> 02:52:51,119
was supposed to be an escape from

3882
02:52:49,350 --> 02:52:52,319
urbanism so once you're in the park you

3883
02:52:51,120 --> 02:52:54,290
don't even realize you're in a city

3884
02:52:52,319 --> 02:52:57,750
anymore

3885
02:52:54,290 --> 02:52:59,729
okay so some yearly stats 42 million

3886
02:52:57,750 --> 02:53:01,530
people visit Central Park every year

3887
02:52:59,728 --> 02:53:03,750
which makes it the fourth most visited

3888
02:53:01,530 --> 02:53:05,489
destination in the entire world behind

3889
02:53:03,750 --> 02:53:11,280
the Eiffel Tower the Great Wall of China

3890
02:53:05,489 --> 02:53:13,409
and the Taj Mahal so it gets a ton of

3891
02:53:11,280 --> 02:53:15,989
traffic this is just like a normal day

3892
02:53:13,409 --> 02:53:17,850
in the summer home it has a seventy

3893
02:53:15,989 --> 02:53:20,100
million dollar budget per year which is

3894
02:53:17,850 --> 02:53:22,319
supplemented by the parks department but

3895
02:53:20,100 --> 02:53:27,899
it's also mostly funded by private

3896
02:53:22,319 --> 02:53:30,449
donations so as far as porta culture

3897
02:53:27,899 --> 02:53:31,770
goes I was a horticulture intern this is

3898
02:53:30,450 --> 02:53:34,290
the garden that I worked in the

3899
02:53:31,770 --> 02:53:38,159
Shakespeare garden it's an essential

3900
02:53:34,290 --> 02:53:40,410
green space in New York City it has tons

3901
02:53:38,159 --> 02:53:42,629
of different plant species some of them

3902
02:53:40,409 --> 02:53:45,000
are very coveted plant species it has

3903
02:53:42,629 --> 02:53:47,279
the largest American elm Grove in the

3904
02:53:45,000 --> 02:53:49,260
world as a lot of you might know Dutch

3905
02:53:47,280 --> 02:53:51,360
elm disease is a problem that's

3906
02:53:49,260 --> 02:53:53,011
decimating American elm populations

3907
02:53:51,360 --> 02:53:54,989
across the

3908
02:53:53,011 --> 02:53:57,331
so it's pretty impressive that this

3909
02:53:54,989 --> 02:54:00,751
massive collection of Elms can still

3910
02:53:57,331 --> 02:54:03,899
exist in one place throughout the park

3911
02:54:00,751 --> 02:54:06,239
there is a lot of variation in design

3912
02:54:03,899 --> 02:54:08,850
and habitat there are three different

3913
02:54:06,239 --> 02:54:11,761
woodlands a variety of wetlands like

3914
02:54:08,851 --> 02:54:13,980
lakes and creeks and ponds there are

3915
02:54:11,761 --> 02:54:15,720
formal and informal Gardens the

3916
02:54:13,979 --> 02:54:19,350
Shakespeare garden where I worked was an

3917
02:54:15,720 --> 02:54:21,930
informal garden and some native plant

3918
02:54:19,351 --> 02:54:26,041
meadows that show off New York State

3919
02:54:21,931 --> 02:54:28,381
native plants so my duties as a

3920
02:54:26,040 --> 02:54:30,779
horticulture intern I shadowed a zone

3921
02:54:28,380 --> 02:54:32,909
gardener for the Shakespeare garden and

3922
02:54:30,780 --> 02:54:35,581
I helped him with his daily tasks

3923
02:54:32,909 --> 02:54:39,630
everything from staking and pruning

3924
02:54:35,581 --> 02:54:43,351
watering picking up trash to design a

3925
02:54:39,630 --> 02:54:45,210
bed layouts this down here is a bed that

3926
02:54:43,351 --> 02:54:47,581
we designed at the beginning of the

3927
02:54:45,210 --> 02:54:52,380
summer and it was huge and gorgeous by

3928
02:54:47,581 --> 02:54:54,091
the end I wish that opposed to picking

3929
02:54:52,380 --> 02:54:55,979
out plants for the following season so

3930
02:54:54,091 --> 02:54:59,011
stuff that's in bloom right now I hope

3931
02:54:55,979 --> 02:55:00,511
to pick out it's pretty cool probably

3932
02:54:59,011 --> 02:55:02,371
the biggest part of my job though was

3933
02:55:00,511 --> 02:55:04,440
just interacting with and assisting art

3934
02:55:02,370 --> 02:55:06,449
patrons because there's so much traffic

3935
02:55:04,440 --> 02:55:07,980
in Central Park every other second

3936
02:55:06,450 --> 02:55:09,301
people are tapped me on the back asking

3937
02:55:07,979 --> 02:55:10,739
you where's the bathroom where's this

3938
02:55:09,300 --> 02:55:13,979
where's that I'm telling about this

3939
02:55:10,739 --> 02:55:16,610
plant so that's that's a big part of it

3940
02:55:13,979 --> 02:55:19,050
just topic talking with the public I

3941
02:55:16,610 --> 02:55:21,351
additionally the internship program

3942
02:55:19,050 --> 02:55:23,729
offered opportunities to tour and

3943
02:55:21,351 --> 02:55:26,101
volunteer at other New York City parks

3944
02:55:23,729 --> 02:55:27,390
in the different five boroughs so I got

3945
02:55:26,101 --> 02:55:28,921
to see a lot of different york city

3946
02:55:27,390 --> 02:55:33,540
parks and helped out with various

3947
02:55:28,921 --> 02:55:35,371
projects okay here is just some photos

3948
02:55:33,540 --> 02:55:36,060
of the variation that you can see in

3949
02:55:35,370 --> 02:55:38,489
Central Park

3950
02:55:36,060 --> 02:55:40,620
up there is the conservatory garden a

3951
02:55:38,489 --> 02:55:43,560
little lily pad pond this is the

3952
02:55:40,620 --> 02:55:45,479
American elm stand it's a super famous

3953
02:55:43,560 --> 02:55:47,581
area of the park called the mall you've

3954
02:55:45,479 --> 02:55:50,100
probably seen tons of movie shops in

3955
02:55:47,581 --> 02:55:52,979
there the harlem mere and then the rest

3956
02:55:50,101 --> 02:55:59,221
of these plants are in the garden that I

3957
02:55:52,979 --> 02:56:01,649
work okay so with all that being said

3958
02:55:59,220 --> 02:56:03,591
there are some problems with Central

3959
02:56:01,649 --> 02:56:05,760
Park and I want to kind of go over those

3960
02:56:03,591 --> 02:56:09,359
for being a green space it

3961
02:56:05,760 --> 02:56:12,809
very not green it has a lot of

3962
02:56:09,359 --> 02:56:15,210
inefficiencies one of them being that it

3963
02:56:12,809 --> 02:56:16,079
doesn't have a waste disposal system for

3964
02:56:15,209 --> 02:56:18,269
plant matter

3965
02:56:16,079 --> 02:56:20,969
there's no composting system in place

3966
02:56:18,270 --> 02:56:22,439
they tried to do a composting system in

3967
02:56:20,969 --> 02:56:24,898
one part of the park but it wasn't hot

3968
02:56:22,439 --> 02:56:27,239
enough to actually degrade the material

3969
02:56:24,898 --> 02:56:29,278
so they ended up dispersing tons of

3970
02:56:27,239 --> 02:56:33,689
invasives across the park and causing a

3971
02:56:29,279 --> 02:56:35,700
lot more problems than health tree and

3972
02:56:33,689 --> 02:56:37,979
turf maintenance takes up a ton of the

3973
02:56:35,700 --> 02:56:41,550
budget trying to keep trees like the

3974
02:56:37,978 --> 02:56:44,429
American elms alive that really are this

3975
02:56:41,549 --> 02:56:46,648
inevitably going to die trying to keep

3976
02:56:44,430 --> 02:56:49,010
grass green throughout the entire summer

3977
02:56:46,648 --> 02:56:52,680
when people are constantly walking on it

3978
02:56:49,010 --> 02:56:54,450
so they like recover the lawns multiple

3979
02:56:52,680 --> 02:56:58,648
times per season which is very costly

3980
02:56:54,450 --> 02:57:03,689
and also removing invasives like mugwort

3981
02:56:58,648 --> 02:57:05,818
and hope we takes up a lot of time a lot

3982
02:57:03,689 --> 02:57:09,059
of money because there's no protocol for

3983
02:57:05,818 --> 02:57:10,379
it once an invasive is removed nothing

3984
02:57:09,059 --> 02:57:12,689
is done to prevent it from coming back

3985
02:57:10,379 --> 02:57:15,179
so that has to be done like every few

3986
02:57:12,689 --> 02:57:16,920
weeks and now there's really no

3987
02:57:15,180 --> 02:57:20,639
foreseeable improvement cities because

3988
02:57:16,920 --> 02:57:24,750
the part has priorities on aesthetics

3989
02:57:20,639 --> 02:57:26,430
versus efficiency so the gardener's

3990
02:57:24,750 --> 02:57:28,170
these are some of the people that I

3991
02:57:26,430 --> 02:57:30,898
worked with every day this is Russell

3992
02:57:28,170 --> 02:57:33,059
Riedel the zone gardener for the zone I

3993
02:57:30,898 --> 02:57:34,469
worked in this is Larry Bo's the head

3994
02:57:33,059 --> 02:57:37,799
gardener for the Shakespeare garden he's

3995
02:57:34,469 --> 02:57:41,608
a mentor and Lisa Kozlowski the head of

3996
02:57:37,799 --> 02:57:43,199
the Hallett nature sanctuary they make

3997
02:57:41,609 --> 02:57:44,970
the park what it is and they're very

3998
02:57:43,200 --> 02:57:47,550
educated and passionate about what they

3999
02:57:44,969 --> 02:57:49,289
do they all into school for horticulture

4000
02:57:47,549 --> 02:57:50,818
and agriculture and botany and so they

4001
02:57:49,290 --> 02:57:52,979
really know what they're doing and they

4002
02:57:50,818 --> 02:57:56,969
really care about how the park looks and

4003
02:57:52,978 --> 02:57:59,519
how it runs unfortunately in the park

4004
02:57:56,969 --> 02:58:01,829
system they are rather underappreciated

4005
02:57:59,520 --> 02:58:04,079
and underrepresented a lot of big

4006
02:58:01,829 --> 02:58:05,850
decisions that are made they're not

4007
02:58:04,079 --> 02:58:08,219
really filled in on they're not asked

4008
02:58:05,850 --> 02:58:09,930
about they're treated as scapegoats so

4009
02:58:08,219 --> 02:58:11,639
any sort of problem that might happen

4010
02:58:09,930 --> 02:58:14,460
like on the ground floor of the park

4011
02:58:11,639 --> 02:58:16,079
it's often blamed on them additionally

4012
02:58:14,459 --> 02:58:17,938
they're made to do tasks below their

4013
02:58:16,079 --> 02:58:19,498
merit they're made to spend at least

4014
02:58:17,939 --> 02:58:23,068
like an hour a day or

4015
02:58:19,498 --> 02:58:25,078
picking up trash or picking up someone's

4016
02:58:23,068 --> 02:58:26,818
dog's poop that they didn't pick up like

4017
02:58:25,078 --> 02:58:31,498
all this stuff that really their time

4018
02:58:26,818 --> 02:58:34,138
could be used more wisely so these

4019
02:58:31,498 --> 02:58:37,859
problems stem from the hierarchy of the

4020
02:58:34,138 --> 02:58:39,688
central park system wealthy donors kind

4021
02:58:37,859 --> 02:58:43,199
of reign supreme here as I said earlier

4022
02:58:39,689 --> 02:58:45,929
they make up the largest portion of the

4023
02:58:43,199 --> 02:58:48,209
budget so they kind of get the most say

4024
02:58:45,929 --> 02:58:50,068
in what happens in the park there's a

4025
02:58:48,209 --> 02:58:53,039
lack of communication between upper

4026
02:58:50,068 --> 02:58:55,378
management and the gardener's and this

4027
02:58:53,039 --> 02:58:57,509
leads to a lot of flawed landscape

4028
02:58:55,379 --> 02:58:59,279
designs and in efficiencies because

4029
02:58:57,509 --> 02:59:01,558
gardeners aren't consulted when really

4030
02:58:59,279 --> 02:59:04,168
they're the ones who see the park on the

4031
02:59:01,558 --> 02:59:06,028
day-to-day basis and know what it needs

4032
02:59:04,168 --> 02:59:08,128
additionally upper management values

4033
02:59:06,029 --> 02:59:10,369
politics more than the park they care

4034
02:59:08,129 --> 02:59:15,059
about connections they care about

4035
02:59:10,369 --> 02:59:17,219
knowing New York elite and middle

4036
02:59:15,058 --> 02:59:19,708
management is essentially non-existent

4037
02:59:17,218 --> 02:59:21,898
as a the beginning of June 50 people

4038
02:59:19,709 --> 02:59:24,299
were fired that's 8 percent of the staff

4039
02:59:21,898 --> 02:59:25,978
and so now there's like no one in the

4040
02:59:24,299 --> 02:59:29,459
middle to kind of like provide a checks

4041
02:59:25,978 --> 02:59:32,578
and balance system so some smaller

4042
02:59:29,459 --> 02:59:34,889
solutions to these problems these are

4043
02:59:32,578 --> 02:59:37,349
just solutions that I'm kind of

4044
02:59:34,888 --> 02:59:38,968
proposing not that they're gonna be put

4045
02:59:37,349 --> 02:59:41,068
in place but I think that there are some

4046
02:59:38,968 --> 02:59:44,009
problems that can be solved

4047
02:59:41,068 --> 02:59:45,868
smaller solutions for the near future a

4048
02:59:44,009 --> 02:59:47,818
composting site that's pretty doable

4049
02:59:45,869 --> 02:59:50,729
just find a site that can get hot enough

4050
02:59:47,818 --> 02:59:52,708
have a protocol in place for separating

4051
02:59:50,728 --> 02:59:56,218
out invasives from things that can be

4052
02:59:52,709 --> 02:59:58,349
used in compost replacing problem plants

4053
02:59:56,218 --> 03:00:00,598
such as replacing a certain type of

4054
02:59:58,349 --> 03:00:03,539
grass that might Brown easily or not

4055
03:00:00,599 --> 03:00:06,689
withstand heavy traffic with a hardy

4056
03:00:03,539 --> 03:00:09,049
earth species invasives management

4057
03:00:06,689 --> 03:00:12,119
protocol so have some sort of system for

4058
03:00:09,049 --> 03:00:13,439
when you remove an invasive prevent it

4059
03:00:12,119 --> 03:00:16,019
from coming back white laying down

4060
03:00:13,439 --> 03:00:20,789
cardboard or some sort of chemical

4061
03:00:16,019 --> 03:00:22,709
deterrent for further future solutions

4062
03:00:20,789 --> 03:00:24,748
global warming should really be

4063
03:00:22,709 --> 03:00:26,989
addressed in Central Park it's one of

4064
03:00:24,748 --> 03:00:30,388
the largest green spaces in the city and

4065
03:00:26,988 --> 03:00:31,859
it holds a lot of power there for stuff

4066
03:00:30,388 --> 03:00:32,969
that can be done to kind of address

4067
03:00:31,859 --> 03:00:37,350
global warming

4068
03:00:32,969 --> 03:00:39,809
um use records oh no use reference sites

4069
03:00:37,350 --> 03:00:42,420
such as Governors Island Park which was

4070
03:00:39,809 --> 03:00:44,459
recently built on Governors Island it's

4071
03:00:42,420 --> 03:00:47,219
built with stand 100 years of sea level

4072
03:00:44,459 --> 03:00:49,709
rise but Juanes Canal Park which is in

4073
03:00:47,219 --> 03:00:52,260
the process of being built in gowanus

4074
03:00:49,709 --> 03:00:55,049
brooklyn which has a lot of plantings

4075
03:00:52,260 --> 03:00:56,760
that deal with bioremediation like

4076
03:00:55,049 --> 03:01:00,299
removal of toxins from the soils and

4077
03:00:56,760 --> 03:01:03,420
waters and those are both great ideas

4078
03:01:00,299 --> 03:01:06,238
for sort of mitigating problems using

4079
03:01:03,420 --> 03:01:08,340
our green space that we already have as

4080
03:01:06,238 --> 03:01:10,109
far as the gardener's go some things

4081
03:01:08,340 --> 03:01:12,180
that can be done to give them more of

4082
03:01:10,109 --> 03:01:13,770
the respect they deserve perhaps we'd be

4083
03:01:12,180 --> 03:01:15,600
signs that say respect that our

4084
03:01:13,770 --> 03:01:18,420
respective caretakers so people know

4085
03:01:15,600 --> 03:01:20,309
that the gardener's are really qualified

4086
03:01:18,420 --> 03:01:21,029
people and that they deserve to be

4087
03:01:20,309 --> 03:01:23,068
respected

4088
03:01:21,029 --> 03:01:25,290
additionally maybe a rebranding could be

4089
03:01:23,068 --> 03:01:28,170
done taking cues from National Park

4090
03:01:25,290 --> 03:01:30,000
Rangers they have this cool title they

4091
03:01:28,170 --> 03:01:32,040
have matching uniforms something like

4092
03:01:30,000 --> 03:01:37,049
that just till I give the Central Park

4093
03:01:32,040 --> 03:01:39,330
gardeners more as far as the kind of

4094
03:01:37,049 --> 03:01:43,170
hierarchy of the Central Park system the

4095
03:01:39,329 --> 03:01:44,488
public like New York City public now is

4096
03:01:43,170 --> 03:01:46,318
aware that there are problems in the

4097
03:01:44,488 --> 03:01:49,289
system because it was widely reported on

4098
03:01:46,318 --> 03:01:50,969
when all those people were fired so it's

4099
03:01:49,290 --> 03:01:53,700
pretty clear that things need to be

4100
03:01:50,969 --> 03:01:56,219
changed gardeners are becoming a lot

4101
03:01:53,700 --> 03:01:58,950
more vocal and they're united in their

4102
03:01:56,219 --> 03:02:00,778
decision to want to be heard to want to

4103
03:01:58,950 --> 03:02:01,520
have more say in what upper management

4104
03:02:00,779 --> 03:02:03,810
decides

4105
03:02:01,520 --> 03:02:05,279
additionally gardeners supervisors are

4106
03:02:03,809 --> 03:02:07,619
in a great position for upward mobility

4107
03:02:05,279 --> 03:02:08,970
into middle management because when all

4108
03:02:07,620 --> 03:02:12,960
those people were fired they kind of

4109
03:02:08,969 --> 03:02:14,760
took on that job anyways the on Central

4110
03:02:12,959 --> 03:02:17,009
Park these are some things that should

4111
03:02:14,760 --> 03:02:19,529
be addressed long term in the Park

4112
03:02:17,010 --> 03:02:22,318
System no two parks are like in New York

4113
03:02:19,529 --> 03:02:23,729
City and that's not a good thing the New

4114
03:02:22,318 --> 03:02:25,559
York City Parks Department is spread

4115
03:02:23,728 --> 03:02:27,148
pretty thin it doesn't have a ton of

4116
03:02:25,559 --> 03:02:30,389
funding and the funding that it does

4117
03:02:27,148 --> 03:02:32,728
have it kind of displaces towards

4118
03:02:30,389 --> 03:02:34,920
wealthier areas for instance High Line

4119
03:02:32,728 --> 03:02:36,750
in Chelsea Manhattan gets a ton of

4120
03:02:34,920 --> 03:02:38,579
funding it's beautiful it has a whole

4121
03:02:36,750 --> 03:02:41,068
bunch of gardeners versus a park like

4122
03:02:38,579 --> 03:02:43,409
Marine Park in Brooklyn that has

4123
03:02:41,068 --> 03:02:45,180
literally one gardener even though it's

4124
03:02:43,409 --> 03:02:48,870
about four times the size of

4125
03:02:45,181 --> 03:02:50,521
hyaline and almost no funding and I

4126
03:02:48,870 --> 03:02:52,020
think hopefully over time that can be

4127
03:02:50,521 --> 03:02:54,061
addressed so all the parts could be

4128
03:02:52,021 --> 03:02:56,881
equally beautiful and equally well cared

4129
03:02:54,060 --> 03:02:59,370
for as a thank you I'd like to thank

4130
03:02:56,880 --> 03:03:03,001
Shanna Blanchard she was the head of the

4131
03:02:59,370 --> 03:03:04,770
internship program she hired me and she

4132
03:03:03,001 --> 03:03:05,569
was fantastic she showed us all around

4133
03:03:04,771 --> 03:03:09,239
New York City

4134
03:03:05,569 --> 03:03:10,800
Larry Bose was my mentor and Russell

4135
03:03:09,239 --> 03:03:13,319
Rydell who I learned a lot from just

4136
03:03:10,800 --> 03:03:24,290
today great people can I take your

4137
03:03:13,319 --> 03:03:28,921
questions why is it not good thing that

4138
03:03:24,290 --> 03:03:30,420
you say I just think that some of the

4139
03:03:28,921 --> 03:03:31,979
parts like really have a lot of

4140
03:03:30,421 --> 03:03:34,711
potential but they're just left to sort

4141
03:03:31,979 --> 03:03:36,331
of the grade because they don't receive

4142
03:03:34,710 --> 03:03:40,770
the same funding that apart in a

4143
03:03:36,331 --> 03:03:43,501
wealthier area would get in funding and

4144
03:03:40,771 --> 03:03:45,511
in staffing like the High Line has

4145
03:03:43,501 --> 03:03:50,271
thousands of gardeners versus other

4146
03:03:45,511 --> 03:03:50,271
parts on the other few other questions

4147
03:03:54,659 --> 03:03:59,829
[Applause]

4148
03:04:02,750 --> 03:04:08,091
our final speaker of the day is

4149
03:04:08,120 --> 03:04:19,940
formatted for final speaker our final

4150
03:04:16,829 --> 03:04:24,539
last but never ever least would be

4151
03:04:19,940 --> 03:04:26,480
Matthew Simon and Hughie talking today I

4152
03:04:24,540 --> 03:04:28,500
still love the title

4153
03:04:26,479 --> 03:04:36,270
[Music]

4154
03:04:28,500 --> 03:04:39,479
summer stress not so amazing so thank

4155
03:04:36,271 --> 03:04:41,670
you Chris hello everybody I'm Matt and

4156
03:04:39,479 --> 03:04:44,850
I'm going to talk about summer stress

4157
03:04:41,670 --> 03:04:51,390
which if you're a corn plant is not so

4158
03:04:44,851 --> 03:04:52,829
amazing so specifically I'm gonna be

4159
03:04:51,390 --> 03:04:55,380
talking about my experience this past

4160
03:04:52,829 --> 03:04:58,500
summer working in dr. yangsun's lab and

4161
03:04:55,380 --> 03:05:00,479
soil and crop sciences I was part of a

4162
03:04:58,500 --> 03:05:02,729
of the beginnings of a a large-scale

4163
03:05:00,479 --> 03:05:04,649
field experiment that is based at

4164
03:05:02,729 --> 03:05:07,319
Musgrave farm which is in Aurora New

4165
03:05:04,649 --> 03:05:09,000
York and the objective of the experiment

4166
03:05:07,319 --> 03:05:12,500
of the experiment that we were setting

4167
03:05:09,000 --> 03:05:15,540
up is that we we want to gather

4168
03:05:12,500 --> 03:05:18,091
large-scale phenotypic data on corn

4169
03:05:15,540 --> 03:05:19,230
crops and field so we did not set up

4170
03:05:18,091 --> 03:05:22,290
controlled environment

4171
03:05:19,229 --> 03:05:24,119
rather we wanted to just see how corn

4172
03:05:22,290 --> 03:05:26,960
crops respond to whatever mother nature

4173
03:05:24,120 --> 03:05:30,780
decides to throw at them and so in

4174
03:05:26,959 --> 03:05:32,459
looking at that we measured a lot of

4175
03:05:30,780 --> 03:05:34,561
different physiological parameters on

4176
03:05:32,459 --> 03:05:36,989
the corn crops in the field so to begin

4177
03:05:34,560 --> 03:05:39,060
with why are we interested corn why does

4178
03:05:36,989 --> 03:05:40,739
one matter well per one corn is the

4179
03:05:39,060 --> 03:05:44,130
biggest crop in the USA economy it's

4180
03:05:40,739 --> 03:05:45,659
extremely important for export a lot we

4181
03:05:44,130 --> 03:05:48,119
export a lot of the corn that we produce

4182
03:05:45,659 --> 03:05:49,909
across this country we also use a lot of

4183
03:05:48,120 --> 03:05:53,311
deployment we produce in things like

4184
03:05:49,909 --> 03:05:55,681
livestock feed and just to give you an

4185
03:05:53,310 --> 03:05:59,039
idea of some of the numbers last year

4186
03:05:55,681 --> 03:06:01,230
alone corn constituted 68 percent of our

4187
03:05:59,040 --> 03:06:03,330
production and grain and oilseed harvest

4188
03:06:01,229 --> 03:06:07,800
so you haven't gathered it's a pretty

4189
03:06:03,329 --> 03:06:10,470
important crop so before I begin talking

4190
03:06:07,800 --> 03:06:12,420
about the materials materials and

4191
03:06:10,470 --> 03:06:14,130
methods that we used I said that we

4192
03:06:12,420 --> 03:06:16,351
gathered data on a few important

4193
03:06:14,130 --> 03:06:16,710
physiological parameters in the corn

4194
03:06:16,351 --> 03:06:19,110
that we

4195
03:06:16,710 --> 03:06:19,831
and the first one of those is water

4196
03:06:19,110 --> 03:06:21,480
potential

4197
03:06:19,831 --> 03:06:24,091
so water potential is basically a

4198
03:06:21,479 --> 03:06:26,279
measure of the water pressure inside of

4199
03:06:24,091 --> 03:06:28,621
a plant it is a measure for whether or

4200
03:06:26,280 --> 03:06:31,051
not that plant is feeling water stressed

4201
03:06:28,620 --> 03:06:32,699
at the time if you find that the water

4202
03:06:31,050 --> 03:06:36,091
potential usually measured in a unit

4203
03:06:32,700 --> 03:06:37,530
like bar its pressure if you find that

4204
03:06:36,091 --> 03:06:39,831
the water potential is looking pretty

4205
03:06:37,530 --> 03:06:42,239
negative that plan is probably feeling

4206
03:06:39,831 --> 03:06:44,069
dehydrated if you find that you rather

4207
03:06:42,239 --> 03:06:46,739
have a pretty positive value for water

4208
03:06:44,069 --> 03:06:49,591
potential then that plants doing pretty

4209
03:06:46,739 --> 03:06:52,319
well we also measured gas exchange and

4210
03:06:49,591 --> 03:06:54,181
gas exchange in this case specifically

4211
03:06:52,319 --> 03:06:56,581
relates to the amount of co2 that is

4212
03:06:54,181 --> 03:06:58,681
assimilated by a plant because plants

4213
03:06:56,581 --> 03:07:01,440
use co2 filling atmosphere to assimilate

4214
03:06:58,681 --> 03:07:04,621
that and fix that into carbohydrates via

4215
03:07:01,440 --> 03:07:07,230
photosynthesis and then a byproduct of

4216
03:07:04,620 --> 03:07:09,540
photosynthesis is oxygen gas which

4217
03:07:07,229 --> 03:07:11,699
plants produce when they during the

4218
03:07:09,540 --> 03:07:14,640
light reactions and then the third

4219
03:07:11,700 --> 03:07:16,891
parameter that we looked at largely is

4220
03:07:14,640 --> 03:07:17,729
chlorophyll fluorescence which and I'm

4221
03:07:16,890 --> 03:07:20,370
going to give you a little review of

4222
03:07:17,729 --> 03:07:21,779
biochemistry here is I think it's a

4223
03:07:20,370 --> 03:07:24,449
pretty interesting topic but it's also a

4224
03:07:21,780 --> 03:07:26,940
complicated one so basically when a co

4225
03:07:24,450 --> 03:07:29,820
wynia when the plant takes in light

4226
03:07:26,940 --> 03:07:32,161
photons of light from the Sun that light

4227
03:07:29,819 --> 03:07:34,380
can basically have one of three

4228
03:07:32,161 --> 03:07:35,911
different face one of those is photo

4229
03:07:34,380 --> 03:07:37,739
chemistry which is just another term for

4230
03:07:35,911 --> 03:07:40,351
photosynthesis that uses that light

4231
03:07:37,739 --> 03:07:42,479
energy to make sugar that light can also

4232
03:07:40,351 --> 03:07:45,239
be given off as heat so it's dissipated

4233
03:07:42,479 --> 03:07:47,251
as heat the third way is fluorescence

4234
03:07:45,239 --> 03:07:49,110
now chlorophyll which is the pigment

4235
03:07:47,251 --> 03:07:51,319
chlorophyll a and B which are the

4236
03:07:49,110 --> 03:07:54,631
pigments responsible for capturing light

4237
03:07:51,319 --> 03:07:56,069
fluoresce red light as you can see here

4238
03:07:54,630 --> 03:07:58,470
and this is a really cool picture under

4239
03:07:56,069 --> 03:07:59,880
UV radiation you can see that

4240
03:07:58,470 --> 03:08:02,251
chlorophyll fluorescence red light and

4241
03:07:59,880 --> 03:08:05,040
so why would we want to measure

4242
03:08:02,251 --> 03:08:07,291
fluorescence because if a plant is

4243
03:08:05,040 --> 03:08:09,390
fluorescing a lot then that means that

4244
03:08:07,290 --> 03:08:11,399
less of that light energy is being

4245
03:08:09,390 --> 03:08:14,550
directed towards photochemistry so high

4246
03:08:11,399 --> 03:08:17,911
fluorescence likely a lower value for

4247
03:08:14,550 --> 03:08:19,591
photo chemistry efficiency so vegan

4248
03:08:17,911 --> 03:08:21,810
materials and methods we measured water

4249
03:08:19,591 --> 03:08:23,251
potential by using something called a

4250
03:08:21,810 --> 03:08:26,341
pressure bomb which is basically a giant

4251
03:08:23,251 --> 03:08:27,810
briefcase with a little nozzle here that

4252
03:08:26,341 --> 03:08:29,819
you can insert a little leaf cutting

4253
03:08:27,810 --> 03:08:31,440
into and then you turn a

4254
03:08:29,819 --> 03:08:33,449
another nozzle and you fill a chamber

4255
03:08:31,440 --> 03:08:34,739
with gas so you build a pressure and you

4256
03:08:33,450 --> 03:08:37,409
get it to the point at which the water

4257
03:08:34,739 --> 03:08:38,640
begins to escape the leaf so at the

4258
03:08:37,409 --> 03:08:41,399
point at which you see a little water

4259
03:08:38,640 --> 03:08:45,479
droplets form on the Leafs cut surface

4260
03:08:41,399 --> 03:08:47,789
that is basically giving you the water

4261
03:08:45,479 --> 03:08:49,649
pressure of the leaf and typically our

4262
03:08:47,790 --> 03:08:51,480
goal is to measure this parameter in the

4263
03:08:49,649 --> 03:08:55,199
early morning so around 7 or 8 o'clock

4264
03:08:51,479 --> 03:08:57,300
a.m. in the field in terms of measuring

4265
03:08:55,200 --> 03:08:59,700
chlorophyll fluorescence and gas

4266
03:08:57,300 --> 03:09:02,760
exchange we used a very wonderful fancy

4267
03:08:59,700 --> 03:09:05,700
machine called a GFS 3000 and how that

4268
03:09:02,761 --> 03:09:07,920
machine basically works is it has a like

4269
03:09:05,700 --> 03:09:09,750
a cuvette that you plant on two elite

4270
03:09:07,920 --> 03:09:11,489
and first we would dark adapt a leaf

4271
03:09:09,750 --> 03:09:13,110
which is what you need to do if you want

4272
03:09:11,489 --> 03:09:14,521
to measure chlorophyll fluorescence we

4273
03:09:13,110 --> 03:09:15,659
would take a piece of tin foil and wrap

4274
03:09:14,521 --> 03:09:16,320
it around to lead so we would

4275
03:09:15,659 --> 03:09:19,920
dark-adapted

4276
03:09:16,319 --> 03:09:22,261
and then we would take the gfs 3000

4277
03:09:19,920 --> 03:09:24,000
which I provided the picture here and we

4278
03:09:22,261 --> 03:09:26,640
would clamp it onto the surface of a

4279
03:09:24,000 --> 03:09:29,129
leaf and that machine would

4280
03:09:26,640 --> 03:09:32,369
simultaneously measure the amount of co2

4281
03:09:29,129 --> 03:09:34,079
that was assimilated and basically taken

4282
03:09:32,370 --> 03:09:36,690
up by the plant it would also measure

4283
03:09:34,079 --> 03:09:38,729
how much o2 oxygen gas is being

4284
03:09:36,690 --> 03:09:40,610
introduced into the atmosphere about

4285
03:09:38,729 --> 03:09:43,859
little microenvironment Nick you bet and

4286
03:09:40,610 --> 03:09:46,110
after shining a bright brief flash of

4287
03:09:43,860 --> 03:09:47,641
light on the leaf tissue it would

4288
03:09:46,110 --> 03:09:51,319
measure chlorophyll fluorescence to give

4289
03:09:47,640 --> 03:09:55,949
us an idea of how efficient that

4290
03:09:51,319 --> 03:09:57,810
photosynthesizing so the use of the

4291
03:09:55,950 --> 03:09:59,971
pressure bomb and the gfs 3000 were

4292
03:09:57,810 --> 03:10:03,390
things we largely intended to use in the

4293
03:09:59,970 --> 03:10:04,949
field whereas in the wet lab we did a

4294
03:10:03,390 --> 03:10:06,840
lot of chlorophyll quantification by

4295
03:10:04,950 --> 03:10:08,851
using a UV vis spectrometer and

4296
03:10:06,840 --> 03:10:11,011
basically what we did with this is we

4297
03:10:08,851 --> 03:10:12,540
would take leaf tissue from corn plants

4298
03:10:11,011 --> 03:10:14,670
we would freeze dry them and grind them

4299
03:10:12,540 --> 03:10:17,101
up and then we would extract things like

4300
03:10:14,670 --> 03:10:19,050
chlorophyll a and B and carotenoids from

4301
03:10:17,101 --> 03:10:21,239
the sleep tissues and we would use a UV

4302
03:10:19,050 --> 03:10:25,079
vis spectrometer kindly provided to us

4303
03:10:21,239 --> 03:10:27,030
by the Martinez lab on 4/9 to basically

4304
03:10:25,079 --> 03:10:28,470
gain an idea of how what the

4305
03:10:27,030 --> 03:10:33,360
concentrations of these pigments were

4306
03:10:28,470 --> 03:10:37,800
and and finally I wasn't directly

4307
03:10:33,360 --> 03:10:41,700
involved in these methods but we also

4308
03:10:37,800 --> 03:10:43,260
use a very large metal tower with arms

4309
03:10:41,700 --> 03:10:45,630
that we fixed onto it so

4310
03:10:43,260 --> 03:10:47,880
we could put data collect data

4311
03:10:45,629 --> 03:10:50,579
collectors onto the urns that gathering

4312
03:10:47,879 --> 03:10:54,239
data on things like ambient humidity the

4313
03:10:50,579 --> 03:10:57,060
amount of sunlight and just gather data

4314
03:10:54,239 --> 03:10:59,729
from the environment of the field and we

4315
03:10:57,060 --> 03:11:01,351
also use soil moisture probes which are

4316
03:10:59,729 --> 03:11:04,560
kindly provided to us by dr. Jeff

4317
03:11:01,351 --> 03:11:09,659
laconian so we could gather data on soil

4318
03:11:04,560 --> 03:11:11,789
moisture results so this summer was kind

4319
03:11:09,659 --> 03:11:13,890
of a washout we had a lot of rain I

4320
03:11:11,790 --> 03:11:16,771
don't know what the stats are for Epica

4321
03:11:13,890 --> 03:11:19,799
but in Aurora at most great farm they

4322
03:11:16,771 --> 03:11:21,989
had the wettest July for I think around

4323
03:11:19,799 --> 03:11:25,379
40 something years so it was a very very

4324
03:11:21,989 --> 03:11:27,021
very rainy summer so why is that a

4325
03:11:25,379 --> 03:11:30,299
problem if you're doing field work

4326
03:11:27,021 --> 03:11:32,010
hopefully in a lab something like rain

4327
03:11:30,299 --> 03:11:34,079
isn't going to be a problem if you're

4328
03:11:32,010 --> 03:11:36,149
indoors but if you're in a field where a

4329
03:11:34,079 --> 03:11:37,709
lot of the roads are dirt roads which

4330
03:11:36,149 --> 03:11:41,310
turn to mud when it rains very hard

4331
03:11:37,709 --> 03:11:45,149
getting to the farm can become a

4332
03:11:41,310 --> 03:11:46,979
substantial challenge and so during late

4333
03:11:45,149 --> 03:11:48,750
June and the month of July we had a

4334
03:11:46,979 --> 03:11:53,159
pretty difficult time getting to the

4335
03:11:48,750 --> 03:11:55,860
farm to collect data a few times so as a

4336
03:11:53,159 --> 03:11:59,459
result that delayed our collection of

4337
03:11:55,860 --> 03:12:01,530
field data until I think it was a late

4338
03:11:59,459 --> 03:12:03,029
July and then to early August is when we

4339
03:12:01,530 --> 03:12:06,840
really got hit the ground running with

4340
03:12:03,030 --> 03:12:08,120
collecting some hard word that we used

4341
03:12:06,840 --> 03:12:11,729
became damaged

4342
03:12:08,120 --> 03:12:14,010
for instance we used to data collectors

4343
03:12:11,729 --> 03:12:16,260
that we stored inside of a styrofoam

4344
03:12:14,010 --> 03:12:20,610
cooler which turned out to not be 100%

4345
03:12:16,260 --> 03:12:22,319
watertight right there and so because

4346
03:12:20,610 --> 03:12:24,090
water doesn't really mix very well with

4347
03:12:22,319 --> 03:12:25,560
computer hardware we had to go back to

4348
03:12:24,090 --> 03:12:27,840
the drawing board and figure out a new

4349
03:12:25,560 --> 03:12:30,000
way to protect that equipment so that

4350
03:12:27,840 --> 03:12:31,530
was an ongoing project personally I

4351
03:12:30,000 --> 03:12:34,049
thought it was fun a fun thing to work

4352
03:12:31,530 --> 03:12:37,290
on but it it was an ongoing challenge

4353
03:12:34,049 --> 03:12:40,199
for us and also the metal tower that I

4354
03:12:37,290 --> 03:12:42,271
mentioned it's tall and it has a lot of

4355
03:12:40,200 --> 03:12:44,670
arms onto it so in the case of inclement

4356
03:12:42,271 --> 03:12:47,130
weather and high wind conditions the

4357
03:12:44,670 --> 03:12:51,510
middle Tower wasn't super stable so that

4358
03:12:47,129 --> 03:12:53,819
was also a source of concern for us I

4359
03:12:51,510 --> 03:12:55,590
will go over the fact that I did get

4360
03:12:53,819 --> 03:12:57,029
some data the other undergraduate

4361
03:12:55,590 --> 03:12:59,219
student that I worked with and loud

4362
03:12:57,029 --> 03:13:01,560
we did a lot of practice in extracting

4363
03:12:59,219 --> 03:13:03,298
chlorophyll so what we did is we had

4364
03:13:01,559 --> 03:13:05,100
some plants that we basically stored in

4365
03:13:03,299 --> 03:13:06,959
the sunroom and Bradfield and then we

4366
03:13:05,100 --> 03:13:08,939
would snip off the leaves freeze dry

4367
03:13:06,959 --> 03:13:10,770
them and just practice the coral

4368
03:13:08,939 --> 03:13:13,470
chlorophyll extraction procedure on

4369
03:13:10,770 --> 03:13:15,060
those leads and elephant in the room the

4370
03:13:13,469 --> 03:13:17,188
16th of June I don't know what I did

4371
03:13:15,059 --> 03:13:20,338
there but I made a mistake here such

4372
03:13:17,189 --> 03:13:22,619
that I got much higher reads for

4373
03:13:20,338 --> 03:13:25,709
chlorophyll and carotenoid

4374
03:13:22,619 --> 03:13:28,890
concentrations so sorry ignore that but

4375
03:13:25,709 --> 03:13:30,930
you can't see that from May 30th to June

4376
03:13:28,889 --> 03:13:34,528
29th the values are relatively

4377
03:13:30,930 --> 03:13:37,168
consistent and what we saw is that clerk

4378
03:13:34,529 --> 03:13:39,299
will a is present and greater amounts in

4379
03:13:37,168 --> 03:13:40,859
chlorophyll B and of course both

4380
03:13:39,299 --> 03:13:42,299
chlorophyll a and work will be are

4381
03:13:40,859 --> 03:13:43,289
present in higher amounts than

4382
03:13:42,299 --> 03:13:44,879
carotenoids which isn't really

4383
03:13:43,289 --> 03:13:46,939
surprising because the leaves we

4384
03:13:44,879 --> 03:13:51,180
collected for green Gardens are orange

4385
03:13:46,939 --> 03:13:53,568
so yeah but I want to mention that the

4386
03:13:51,180 --> 03:13:56,430
reason why chlorophyll a is in greater

4387
03:13:53,568 --> 03:13:58,828
quantity things work will be is because

4388
03:13:56,430 --> 03:14:00,238
while these are both the main types of

4389
03:13:58,828 --> 03:14:04,109
chlorophyll that we see in plant leaves

4390
03:14:00,238 --> 03:14:06,658
chlorophyll a is known to interact more

4391
03:14:04,109 --> 03:14:08,189
directly with capturing light so in this

4392
03:14:06,658 --> 03:14:11,658
way chlorophyll a is known as the

4393
03:14:08,189 --> 03:14:13,859
primary light capturing pigment so

4394
03:14:11,658 --> 03:14:15,958
chlorophyll a is present in the reaction

4395
03:14:13,859 --> 03:14:18,568
centers which is like the core of the

4396
03:14:15,959 --> 03:14:21,088
reaction center that captures the energy

4397
03:14:18,568 --> 03:14:24,208
from photons chlorophyll B are known as

4398
03:14:21,088 --> 03:14:26,309
is known as an accessory pigment so they

4399
03:14:24,209 --> 03:14:28,140
are inside of the antenna pigments that

4400
03:14:26,309 --> 03:14:30,118
surround the reaction Center complexes

4401
03:14:28,139 --> 03:14:34,458
and leaves and they basically just play

4402
03:14:30,119 --> 03:14:34,459
a hot potato with the energy that comes

4403
03:14:35,658 --> 03:14:40,559
valuable takeaway so in spite of the

4404
03:14:37,709 --> 03:14:44,159
fact that we were delayed and getting

4405
03:14:40,559 --> 03:14:47,038
the field data captured we were still

4406
03:14:44,158 --> 03:14:49,288
setting things up and seeing what worked

4407
03:14:47,039 --> 03:14:51,209
I personally had a lot of very valuable

4408
03:14:49,289 --> 03:14:53,489
takeaways from from this experience

4409
03:14:51,209 --> 03:14:55,379
first and foremost I personally learned

4410
03:14:53,488 --> 03:14:58,408
that in the case of doing field work

4411
03:14:55,379 --> 03:15:01,560
this requires special planning and

4412
03:14:58,408 --> 03:15:03,898
foresight that you might not be applying

4413
03:15:01,559 --> 03:15:06,748
to working in a wet lab for instance as

4414
03:15:03,898 --> 03:15:08,608
I said rain shouldn't be a problem when

4415
03:15:06,748 --> 03:15:09,809
you're working in a wet lab rain and

4416
03:15:08,609 --> 03:15:10,729
inclement weather are absolutely

4417
03:15:09,809 --> 03:15:12,380
something that need to be

4418
03:15:10,729 --> 03:15:14,630
considered when you're doing a study as

4419
03:15:12,380 --> 03:15:16,789
there other things like pathogens which

4420
03:15:14,630 --> 03:15:19,520
did go up due to the fact that we had

4421
03:15:16,790 --> 03:15:21,530
very moist conditions this summer so I

4422
03:15:19,521 --> 03:15:24,500
learned the value of proper planning in

4423
03:15:21,530 --> 03:15:25,971
this case also personally I had a lot of

4424
03:15:24,500 --> 03:15:28,579
fun learning to use cutting-edge

4425
03:15:25,970 --> 03:15:30,109
equipment as I said I had limited

4426
03:15:28,579 --> 03:15:33,649
exposure to using a pressure bomb before

4427
03:15:30,110 --> 03:15:35,870
which was a lot of fun and also I had

4428
03:15:33,649 --> 03:15:38,091
never used a gfs 3000 before to gather

4429
03:15:35,870 --> 03:15:39,771
data on things like gas exchange and

4430
03:15:38,091 --> 03:15:41,030
chlorophyll fluorescence so that was

4431
03:15:39,771 --> 03:15:42,230
really really cool to learn how to use

4432
03:15:41,030 --> 03:15:45,980
that and not just learn how to use those

4433
03:15:42,229 --> 03:15:47,869
equipment in the wet lab where things

4434
03:15:45,979 --> 03:15:49,761
are pretty ideal it's pretty ideal

4435
03:15:47,870 --> 03:15:51,261
environment but to also carry those out

4436
03:15:49,761 --> 03:15:55,909
to the field and learn how to use those

4437
03:15:51,261 --> 03:15:58,399
in an open environment I also want to

4438
03:15:55,909 --> 03:16:00,619
just name briefly the fact that I think

4439
03:15:58,399 --> 03:16:04,250
it's really important and enriching to

4440
03:16:00,620 --> 03:16:06,620
have a balance between fieldwork and wet

4441
03:16:04,250 --> 03:16:09,021
lab work because personally for me that

4442
03:16:06,620 --> 03:16:11,721
gave me the chance to see how cellular

4443
03:16:09,021 --> 03:16:13,820
and molecular processes that I was

4444
03:16:11,720 --> 03:16:15,380
looking at and the wet lab can be

4445
03:16:13,819 --> 03:16:17,449
connected to what I see on the whole

4446
03:16:15,380 --> 03:16:19,421
plant level in the field so being able

4447
03:16:17,450 --> 03:16:22,551
to connect those two observations and

4448
03:16:19,421 --> 03:16:24,530
areas of research I think is especially

4449
03:16:22,550 --> 03:16:26,300
important and the field of plant science

4450
03:16:24,530 --> 03:16:27,891
and also I got to work with some very

4451
03:16:26,300 --> 03:16:30,859
knowledgeable and wonderful people in

4452
03:16:27,890 --> 03:16:33,800
the lab who know a lot about the fields

4453
03:16:30,860 --> 03:16:36,400
and we're very very helpful to Julie the

4454
03:16:33,800 --> 03:16:38,329
under 100 graduate student I and

4455
03:16:36,399 --> 03:16:40,369
learning at a better performing search

4456
03:16:38,329 --> 03:16:43,780
so that being said I would like to

4457
03:16:40,370 --> 03:16:47,271
acknowledge dr. eunsung my PI and the

4458
03:16:43,780 --> 03:16:49,790
head honcho of the Sun lab dr. christine

4459
03:16:47,271 --> 03:16:51,530
chang who was the postdoctoral student

4460
03:16:49,790 --> 03:16:52,940
that i worked with dr. Jeff meconium who

4461
03:16:51,530 --> 03:16:56,480
provided a lot of very invaluable

4462
03:16:52,940 --> 03:16:58,370
insight and help to us and letting us

4463
03:16:56,479 --> 03:17:00,640
use his soil moisture probes and helping

4464
03:16:58,370 --> 03:17:03,771
us set up and run a lot of our field

4465
03:17:00,640 --> 03:17:06,949
equipment dr. carmen aided martinez who

4466
03:17:03,771 --> 03:17:09,261
kindly let us use a lot of her equipment

4467
03:17:06,950 --> 03:17:12,320
and her lab on floor 9 of Bradfield hall

4468
03:17:09,261 --> 03:17:13,909
we used her UV vis spectrometer and also

4469
03:17:12,319 --> 03:17:15,199
Julie Levon who was the under

4470
03:17:13,909 --> 03:17:17,750
undergraduate student that I worked with

4471
03:17:15,200 --> 03:17:19,610
this summer and who I hell up I'm

4472
03:17:17,750 --> 03:17:22,720
working with so thank you very much and

4473
03:17:19,610 --> 03:17:22,721
I am happy to answer questions

4474
03:17:25,810 --> 03:17:43,239
since format well a I think it's

4475
03:17:41,511 --> 03:17:48,860
important to point out to everyone that

4476
03:17:43,239 --> 03:17:53,720
farming is hard right don't ever forget

4477
03:17:48,860 --> 03:17:56,631
that meat and thank a farmer always but

4478
03:17:53,720 --> 03:17:58,430
what I did so I guess in terms of the

4479
03:17:56,630 --> 03:18:01,699
maize

4480
03:17:58,431 --> 03:18:04,159
what are the plans to repeat things this

4481
03:18:01,700 --> 03:18:06,771
summer what you know what where are

4482
03:18:04,159 --> 03:18:09,739
these experiments going um it is an

4483
03:18:06,771 --> 03:18:12,051
ongoing project uh I am not entirely

4484
03:18:09,739 --> 03:18:14,181
sure actually Julie is returning this

4485
03:18:12,050 --> 03:18:17,689
summer and what I heard I personally am

4486
03:18:14,181 --> 03:18:19,521
NOT unfortunately but it's yeah I think

4487
03:18:17,690 --> 03:18:22,730
it's it's an ongoing project you gotta

4488
03:18:19,521 --> 03:18:24,650
mark and we were this past summer was a

4489
03:18:22,729 --> 03:18:27,170
lot about setting up our field

4490
03:18:24,649 --> 03:18:29,659
experiments and field data and really

4491
03:18:27,170 --> 03:18:32,750
seeing what needed to be streamlined and

4492
03:18:29,659 --> 03:18:34,341
given further attention so a lot of it

4493
03:18:32,750 --> 03:18:35,690
was seeing what worked and what needed

4494
03:18:34,341 --> 03:18:40,159
more attention

4495
03:18:35,690 --> 03:18:41,329
this summer I'm probably people have a

4496
03:18:40,159 --> 03:18:44,271
little have a better idea of what works

4497
03:18:41,329 --> 03:18:46,130
and what doesn't and there will probably

4498
03:18:44,271 --> 03:18:48,381
be a drought yes because it's every

4499
03:18:46,130 --> 03:18:51,229
other year one year we get wet

4500
03:18:48,380 --> 03:18:55,219
conditions in the other year we have so

4501
03:18:51,229 --> 03:19:00,309
all right well thank you Matthew

4502
03:18:55,219 --> 03:19:00,309
[Applause]

4503
03:19:05,369 --> 03:19:11,049
so I would like to thank all of the

4504
03:19:09,158 --> 03:19:13,809
students again you guys did a great job

4505
03:19:11,049 --> 03:19:16,600
I would love to get a picture of you to

4506
03:19:13,809 --> 03:19:18,488
tweet out after so you guys can all just

4507
03:19:16,600 --> 03:19:19,959
hang out there and mike has to go there

4508
03:19:18,488 --> 03:19:23,770
so I can get a picture everyone to tweet

4509
03:19:19,959 --> 03:19:27,310
out and thank Mike my partner in crime

4510
03:19:23,770 --> 03:19:38,350
for this capstone seminar series so

4511
03:19:27,309 --> 03:19:40,118
we'll see you all next year this has

4512
03:19:38,350 --> 03:19:45,869
been a production of Cornell University

4513
03:19:40,119 --> 03:19:45,869
