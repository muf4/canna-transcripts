1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:04,860
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,229 --> 00:00:04,859
University

3
00:00:09,199 --> 00:00:15,839
so today I'm going to talk about some of

4
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:19,920
the different types of projects that

5
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:22,109
I've been involved in in Geneva and this

6
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,570
is going to seem possibly like a

7
00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:26,278
schizophrenic talk and if so that's

8
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:27,300
because my job is a little bit

9
00:00:26,278 --> 00:00:30,778
schizophrenic

10
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:32,820
I work in two research units both the

11
00:00:30,778 --> 00:00:34,380
plant genetic resources unit and those

12
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:37,170
of you who are lucky enough to hear

13
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:40,230
Joann last week speaks she's in this

14
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:43,379
unit but I also work with the grape

15
00:00:40,229 --> 00:00:49,288
genetics research unit so this one is

16
00:00:43,378 --> 00:00:51,988
involved in conservation of crops and

17
00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:54,390
it's a seed bank sort of sort of group

18
00:00:51,988 --> 00:00:57,390
and this one is more involved in

19
00:00:54,390 --> 00:01:02,280
understanding grape genomics and

20
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:04,799
genetics and disease resistance so let's

21
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:06,719
just start by talking about what is a

22
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:08,189
computational biologist there's a lot of

23
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:11,819
terms you hear bioinformatics

24
00:01:08,189 --> 00:01:14,340
computational biology and I like the

25
00:01:11,819 --> 00:01:16,379
term computational biologist because it

26
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:21,450
explains the fact that I am first a

27
00:01:16,379 --> 00:01:23,849
biologist but I do it by computers so my

28
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:26,010
original training was in genetics I

29
00:01:23,849 --> 00:01:29,669
think about the structure function and

30
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:32,100
evolution of genomes but I do it in a

31
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:36,480
computer instead of at a lab bench or in

32
00:01:32,099 --> 00:01:39,959
the field so that's the perspective that

33
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:42,920
I come to this with I started as a

34
00:01:39,959 --> 00:01:46,259
biologist and then added the computers

35
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:48,000
so here's why what I do is going to

36
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:51,810
sound a little bit complicated and

37
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:56,430
that's because it is 80% of my time is

38
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:58,950
paid for by the folks who work in the

39
00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:01,680
clonal repository in clonal just means

40
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:03,390
that these crops are grafted so that's

41
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:07,530
the apples the tart cherries and the

42
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:09,118
grapes that we curate in Geneva and we

43
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:10,500
distribute the germ plasm and

44
00:02:09,118 --> 00:02:14,848
characterize it and I'm part of the

45
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:16,199
characterizing process 24% of my time

46
00:02:14,848 --> 00:02:18,929
where is working with the seed

47
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:20,250
repository and there are many many

48
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:23,370
vegetables in this report

49
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:26,030
auditory joanne is in this group and one

50
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:28,500
of them is tomato and you'll see some

51
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:32,430
work that we did in tomato they're

52
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:34,650
together 15 percent of my time is on

53
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:37,680
Apple rootstock breeding with general

54
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:40,469
fat CEO who's in this this section and

55
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:42,540
then the remaining 20% of my time is

56
00:02:40,469 --> 00:02:46,530
split between working on grapes ion

57
00:02:42,539 --> 00:02:49,620
genomics and grape disease resistance so

58
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:51,990
I work on a vast variety of types of

59
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:54,150
questions and a vast variety of

60
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:56,760
organisms and so what you're gonna see

61
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:59,550
today is going to cover a lot of

62
00:02:56,759 --> 00:03:02,069
organisms and a lot of questions so just

63
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:03,510
bear with me strap your seatbelt in

64
00:03:02,069 --> 00:03:05,659
because it's going to be fast but what

65
00:03:03,509 --> 00:03:08,669
I'm gonna try and do is least get across

66
00:03:05,659 --> 00:03:10,979
what it is we wanted to find out why we

67
00:03:08,669 --> 00:03:13,139
wanted to find it out and what we found

68
00:03:10,979 --> 00:03:18,119
out but there's a lot of projects so

69
00:03:13,139 --> 00:03:19,859
just bear with me so the first the first

70
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:21,509
series of projects I'm going to talk

71
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:23,790
about actually came out of a

72
00:03:21,509 --> 00:03:29,219
collaboration with people in this very

73
00:03:23,789 --> 00:03:32,340
department Courtney and Surin approached

74
00:03:29,219 --> 00:03:35,489
me many years ago and asked me what can

75
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:38,099
we do with the resistance gene analogs

76
00:03:35,489 --> 00:03:39,959
in rubus and I realized there's an

77
00:03:38,099 --> 00:03:43,469
opportunity here to work out a system

78
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:46,080
that could be applied to the other crops

79
00:03:43,469 --> 00:03:48,780
that we have in our repository and so we

80
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:51,719
did that and actually what came out of

81
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:55,769
that was also eventually later a

82
00:03:51,719 --> 00:03:59,310
master's thesis from a student at RIT so

83
00:03:55,769 --> 00:04:02,069
one of the things I've done in Geneva is

84
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:04,920
help supervise or act as a functional

85
00:04:02,069 --> 00:04:06,989
thesis advisor for masters students

86
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:11,009
working in the field of bioinformatics

87
00:04:06,989 --> 00:04:14,159
at Rochester Institute of Technology who

88
00:04:11,009 --> 00:04:16,349
need real-life problems to work on and

89
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:17,548
somebody to help guide them through that

90
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:19,890
they can apply what they've learned

91
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:21,689
toward and then make it into a thesis

92
00:04:19,889 --> 00:04:25,289
and there's two theses I'll talk about

93
00:04:21,689 --> 00:04:27,029
today and one of them was done with

94
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:29,099
Aubrey Baily so it's kind of neat to see

95
00:04:27,029 --> 00:04:31,649
the progression and one of this project

96
00:04:29,098 --> 00:04:33,050
actually came out of something that was

97
00:04:31,649 --> 00:04:36,408
a collaboration

98
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:40,069
originally from this department so in

99
00:04:36,408 --> 00:04:43,310
this project we collected a whole bunch

100
00:04:40,069 --> 00:04:46,120
of resistance gene analogues now it's

101
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:48,259
convenient about these NBS lrr

102
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:50,449
resistance genes is that they have

103
00:04:48,259 --> 00:04:53,960
conserved fried sections that can be

104
00:04:50,449 --> 00:04:56,629
used for sitting primers down and then

105
00:04:53,959 --> 00:04:59,568
you can amplify between them to get the

106
00:04:56,629 --> 00:05:01,340
variable part and you can all because

107
00:04:59,569 --> 00:05:02,900
that's a convenient thing to do lots of

108
00:05:01,339 --> 00:05:05,149
people have done this in other organisms

109
00:05:02,899 --> 00:05:06,888
besides the ones that we gathered the

110
00:05:05,149 --> 00:05:09,439
sequences from so we gathered a whole

111
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:12,139
bunch from gene Bank we collected some

112
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:14,269
from cherry from our collection we

113
00:05:12,139 --> 00:05:16,069
collected a whole bunch from apples in

114
00:05:14,269 --> 00:05:17,990
our collection and there are even the

115
00:05:16,069 --> 00:05:22,669
ones that we got from the project with

116
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:25,728
Courtney and with these what Aubrey the

117
00:05:22,668 --> 00:05:31,389
student from RIT was able to do was to

118
00:05:25,728 --> 00:05:34,120
cluster these and we were able to see

119
00:05:31,389 --> 00:05:38,000
classify these resistance genes

120
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:42,019
according to what their sequence

121
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:45,110
similarity was based on a hypothetically

122
00:05:42,019 --> 00:05:49,370
translated protein sequence so this was

123
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:52,639
a huge huge huge project and we were

124
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:55,598
also involving all of the resistance

125
00:05:52,639 --> 00:06:02,870
genes found in the recent been recently

126
00:05:55,598 --> 00:06:06,110
sequenced apple genome so we did a big

127
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:08,209
tree we found that they were classified

128
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:10,490
that there were some resistance genes

129
00:06:08,209 --> 00:06:12,408
that were not even found in domestic

130
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:14,329
apple at all but they were available in

131
00:06:12,408 --> 00:06:19,009
other wild species and that's important

132
00:06:14,329 --> 00:06:21,589
because if you're trying to find parents

133
00:06:19,009 --> 00:06:25,098
to breed for novel resistance an apple

134
00:06:21,589 --> 00:06:27,918
you might want to go for the samples in

135
00:06:25,098 --> 00:06:32,449
our germ plasm collection that have

136
00:06:27,918 --> 00:06:34,370
novel resistance gene analogs so that

137
00:06:32,449 --> 00:06:37,189
that can in turn help breeders and

138
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:40,278
meanwhile we've also with a big group

139
00:06:37,189 --> 00:06:42,829
that involved collaborators from all

140
00:06:40,278 --> 00:06:46,409
over the world we've mapped some of

141
00:06:42,829 --> 00:06:50,069
these resistance gene analogues to

142
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:52,840
fire blight resistance hello sigh and

143
00:06:50,069 --> 00:06:56,170
recently we're just finishing up there's

144
00:06:52,839 --> 00:06:58,739
one that might actually it came from a

145
00:06:56,170 --> 00:07:00,730
powdery mildew resistant cherry strain

146
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:04,720
and Amy Aya's Oni

147
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:06,850
in Michigan State is mapping QTL there

148
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:10,450
and so it may be that we'll also have a

149
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:12,340
similar result that these things are

150
00:07:10,449 --> 00:07:15,639
showing up in the same part of the

151
00:07:12,339 --> 00:07:18,759
genome that is involved in known

152
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:20,469
resistance for cherries as well so that

153
00:07:18,759 --> 00:07:21,990
was that was one project we're switching

154
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:24,700
gears now

155
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:27,480
now here's another type of project I've

156
00:07:24,699 --> 00:07:30,579
done and this one had to do with

157
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:35,250
figuring out what the risk was of

158
00:07:30,579 --> 00:07:39,459
transferring transmitting resistant

159
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:41,740
alleles or sorry disease susceptible

160
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:44,579
alleles depending on which grapefruit

161
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:48,220
stock you use so there was a question

162
00:07:44,579 --> 00:07:51,029
with this freedom grapefruit stock it's

163
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:54,090
valuable because it's nematode resistant

164
00:07:51,029 --> 00:07:57,699
but the question about freedom is

165
00:07:54,089 --> 00:08:00,339
doesn't already have is it likely to

166
00:07:57,699 --> 00:08:03,879
already have flux or resistance or not

167
00:08:00,339 --> 00:08:05,949
if it's likely to be flux or susceptible

168
00:08:03,879 --> 00:08:09,639
then it might not be so good for

169
00:08:05,949 --> 00:08:11,529
breeding more grapefruit sucks so the

170
00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:15,219
question in this case was more of a

171
00:08:11,529 --> 00:08:17,949
paternity analysis question because if

172
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:21,490
we could piece together who the parents

173
00:08:17,949 --> 00:08:24,879
and grandparents were of freedom and if

174
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:27,040
they were not vanilla then freedom was

175
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:30,430
more likely to be resistant to phlox

176
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:34,659
Roth we knew that freedom was derived

177
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:37,629
from open pollinated parents and there

178
00:08:34,659 --> 00:08:41,409
were 31 potential pollen donors in a

179
00:08:37,629 --> 00:08:46,090
grape in a vineyard in Fresno that David

180
00:08:41,409 --> 00:08:48,699
ramming one usda grape

181
00:08:46,090 --> 00:08:51,190
breeder had but we didn't know which

182
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:54,490
parents might be the actual pollen

183
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:56,470
donors so we did took thirty

184
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:57,490
microsatellite markers and this is old

185
00:08:56,470 --> 00:09:00,459
technology but it

186
00:08:57,490 --> 00:09:02,200
still interesting so we took 30 micro

187
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:05,049
satellite markers and we looked at this

188
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:07,839
genetic tree of freedom and also of its

189
00:09:05,049 --> 00:09:11,769
half subharmonic and we started asking

190
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:18,040
who are the pollen donors and we found

191
00:09:11,769 --> 00:09:20,679
some of them so we knew that and also

192
00:09:18,039 --> 00:09:22,419
some of these individuals were dead so

193
00:09:20,679 --> 00:09:27,519
the ones in the boxes are definitely

194
00:09:22,419 --> 00:09:30,549
dead and we knew that the mother of

195
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:33,069
freedom was sixteen 1359 we were able to

196
00:09:30,549 --> 00:09:35,169
confirm that because that sample was

197
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:41,649
still alive in the vineyard when we

198
00:09:35,169 --> 00:09:44,769
tested we knew that the mother for 16

199
00:09:41,649 --> 00:09:47,110
the grandmother was supposed to be 16 13

200
00:09:44,769 --> 00:09:49,778
see we confirmed that and then we

201
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:54,490
identified that the grandfather of

202
00:09:49,778 --> 00:09:56,620
freedom was a cross derived from a cross

203
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:59,169
between ripe area and reap estrus

204
00:09:56,620 --> 00:10:02,560
neither of which is vanilla which is

205
00:09:59,169 --> 00:10:06,120
really nice because that means that it's

206
00:10:02,559 --> 00:10:09,729
less likely to be susceptible to falaqa

207
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:11,470
we also tried to find these individuals

208
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:15,190
but it appears that they were no longer

209
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:17,320
alive in the vineyard or else their

210
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:20,380
alleles weren't unique enough to be able

211
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:23,320
to identify with this study so that was

212
00:10:20,379 --> 00:10:27,250
a paternity analysis in grape that we

213
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:29,800
did okay switching gears again here's

214
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:31,659
another master's thesis this one is on a

215
00:10:29,799 --> 00:10:33,519
completely different organism it's not

216
00:10:31,659 --> 00:10:36,519
even a plant we're talking about fungi

217
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:39,699
now lance Cadle davidson is a

218
00:10:36,519 --> 00:10:42,189
collaborator of mine in Geneva and he

219
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:45,610
works on disease resistance in grapes

220
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:48,459
and in on their pathogens and he had a

221
00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:51,909
project where he had a lot of sequence

222
00:10:48,458 --> 00:10:56,979
from a great many different varieties of

223
00:10:51,909 --> 00:10:59,409
grape powdery mildew and the problem and

224
00:10:56,980 --> 00:11:02,320
he got his thesis this year or just this

225
00:10:59,409 --> 00:11:04,958
past year and he was again another RIT

226
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:06,170
student that I had supervised first

227
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:09,259
thesis

228
00:11:06,169 --> 00:11:12,139
and the problem with great powdery

229
00:11:09,259 --> 00:11:14,629
mildew which is here is that there was

230
00:11:12,139 --> 00:11:18,528
almost no information about it there may

231
00:11:14,629 --> 00:11:20,720
be five sequences in GenBank altogether

232
00:11:18,528 --> 00:11:23,509
or something on it it was very very few

233
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:26,028
and it's next closest relative that we

234
00:11:23,509 --> 00:11:29,389
knew anything about was way down here

235
00:11:26,028 --> 00:11:32,409
bloom area Graham anise now this one was

236
00:11:29,389 --> 00:11:34,759
sequenced and there was a paper where

237
00:11:32,409 --> 00:11:37,399
lots of people got together and

238
00:11:34,759 --> 00:11:40,490
annotated it but there was nothing

239
00:11:37,399 --> 00:11:44,809
available for this organism and so what

240
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:48,799
we did was we went to transcriptomics so

241
00:11:44,809 --> 00:11:52,009
we took the transcripts and we had to

242
00:11:48,799 --> 00:11:55,698
figure out how to assemble a reference

243
00:11:52,009 --> 00:12:00,588
transcriptome from scratch and then how

244
00:11:55,698 --> 00:12:04,278
to describe the polymorphisms among the

245
00:12:00,589 --> 00:12:07,070
different isolates and we had 56 of them

246
00:12:04,278 --> 00:12:09,649
if you include the reference version so

247
00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:12,019
this was one example of taking organism

248
00:12:09,649 --> 00:12:14,179
that you know almost nothing about from

249
00:12:12,019 --> 00:12:20,980
scratch and figuring out what you can

250
00:12:14,179 --> 00:12:23,719
just from the transcriptome so together

251
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:26,360
Jason and I worked out a workflow and

252
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:29,199
this was a lot of trial and error we had

253
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:35,990
a lot of four or five for sequencing of

254
00:12:29,198 --> 00:12:38,629
the of one single isolate and then we

255
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:42,759
had a lot of Illumina paradin sequencing

256
00:12:38,629 --> 00:12:45,169
data from that isolate plus 55 other

257
00:12:42,759 --> 00:12:47,208
geographic isolates now what's different

258
00:12:45,169 --> 00:12:50,149
about these isolates is that some

259
00:12:47,208 --> 00:12:52,759
there's a there's a genetics arms race

260
00:12:50,149 --> 00:12:55,940
going on between the powdery mildew and

261
00:12:52,759 --> 00:12:59,470
the grape and the question is what

262
00:12:55,940 --> 00:13:02,899
regions of the powdery mildew genome are

263
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:04,670
mutating more quickly because if we can

264
00:13:02,899 --> 00:13:07,730
figure out which ones are mutating more

265
00:13:04,669 --> 00:13:11,439
quickly we might have a clue as to which

266
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:15,649
parts are helping the powdery mildew

267
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:17,950
gain access foothold into the vineyards

268
00:13:15,649 --> 00:13:19,690
where they're supposed to be

269
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:22,480
distance so in other words how its

270
00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:24,610
winning its side of the arms race so

271
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:26,680
that was the whole object so in order to

272
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:29,590
do that first we had to figure out how

273
00:13:26,679 --> 00:13:34,149
to assemble the genome sorry the

274
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:37,840
transcriptome so it was assembled it was

275
00:13:34,149 --> 00:13:40,199
mapped to the closest relative and then

276
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:43,240
we also did paired in sequencing

277
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:46,090
assembled that and assembled that de

278
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:49,419
novo out of these three different

279
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:51,970
assemblies we devised ways of asked to

280
00:13:49,419 --> 00:13:55,059
ascertaining which assembly was the best

281
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:58,149
one and that's tricky all in itself

282
00:13:55,059 --> 00:14:01,119
because is it by length of context is it

283
00:13:58,149 --> 00:14:04,179
by number of context and or is it maybe

284
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:06,669
by how many protein sequences are

285
00:14:04,179 --> 00:14:08,979
predicted that makes sense based on what

286
00:14:06,669 --> 00:14:11,589
you expect in say the next closest

287
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:16,000
relative so you have to balance a lot of

288
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:18,700
different criteria in order to figure

289
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:23,889
out which is your best assembly to begin

290
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:28,300
with now once we did do that then we did

291
00:14:23,889 --> 00:14:31,809
some finer tuning of figuring out which

292
00:14:28,299 --> 00:14:34,299
genes we had relative to what was known

293
00:14:31,809 --> 00:14:37,899
in bloom area gram Onis than nearest

294
00:14:34,299 --> 00:14:41,139
relative and then we took the single end

295
00:14:37,899 --> 00:14:44,289
sequence or the the other isolates and

296
00:14:41,139 --> 00:14:46,179
aligned them as well put this all

297
00:14:44,289 --> 00:14:48,279
together and ended up putting it in a

298
00:14:46,179 --> 00:14:50,679
genome browser so our scientific

299
00:14:48,279 --> 00:14:52,959
colleagues at the bench in other parts

300
00:14:50,679 --> 00:14:57,309
of the country in the world could then

301
00:14:52,960 --> 00:15:00,910
go and identify these regions and start

302
00:14:57,309 --> 00:15:03,339
to focus their research on them so

303
00:15:00,909 --> 00:15:06,009
here's an example of some of the types

304
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:08,350
of ways that we would visualize the data

305
00:15:06,009 --> 00:15:14,939
in order to figure out if what we had

306
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:18,940
even made sense over here on the left is

307
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:23,080
simply a scatter plot of contig length

308
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:25,330
versus number of reads in the context so

309
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:28,270
the idea is that you would want to have

310
00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:31,180
bigger contexts ought to be bigger not

311
00:15:28,269 --> 00:15:33,519
because you have the same read piling

312
00:15:31,179 --> 00:15:36,219
up on top of itself over and over and

313
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:39,009
over but rather you have multiple reeds

314
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:41,320
all sticking next to each other building

315
00:15:39,009 --> 00:15:44,559
a larger and larger and larger context

316
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:47,230
and it's sort of comforting to see that

317
00:15:44,559 --> 00:15:50,669
we do have a relationship there where

318
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:53,649
you have more context or more reeds in

319
00:15:50,669 --> 00:15:56,319
the larger context so that means the

320
00:15:53,649 --> 00:16:00,059
assembly is probably working fairly well

321
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:03,160
and that the libraries weren't just

322
00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:06,819
copies all of the same transcript over

323
00:16:03,159 --> 00:16:07,750
and over and over and over on top of

324
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:09,220
each other because even when you

325
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:10,870
normalize that doesn't always

326
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:13,870
necessarily work so this was good

327
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:15,669
confirmation that the assembly seemed to

328
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:18,669
be working and that the normalization

329
00:16:15,669 --> 00:16:21,579
had worked pretty well and then you want

330
00:16:18,669 --> 00:16:24,279
to ask well if the context as they get

331
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:26,889
longer and longer then they ought to

332
00:16:24,279 --> 00:16:28,720
match things that you expect to see in

333
00:16:26,889 --> 00:16:31,480
that organism better and better and

334
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:34,500
better because if you do say a blast

335
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:38,019
match between two different sequences

336
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:42,700
the score that you get is dependent on

337
00:16:38,019 --> 00:16:46,090
the length of that match so the longer

338
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:48,759
the longer that section of sequence is

339
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:52,330
that matches the better your score is

340
00:16:48,759 --> 00:16:55,450
and so if you have a contig that's

341
00:16:52,330 --> 00:16:58,690
longer it ought to have better potential

342
00:16:55,450 --> 00:17:00,430
to match a long context somewhere else

343
00:16:58,690 --> 00:17:05,650
in other words it ought to have a better

344
00:17:00,429 --> 00:17:11,200
blast score and so here is a graph with

345
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:12,700
the context along the x-axis so the

346
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:16,380
longer contexts are over here and the

347
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:21,100
shorter contexts are here and here is

348
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:24,550
the blast score and you can see that

349
00:17:21,099 --> 00:17:29,379
well we do get some longer contigs with

350
00:17:24,549 --> 00:17:32,169
pretty low blast matches the best blast

351
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:34,630
matches do come from the longest context

352
00:17:32,170 --> 00:17:39,490
and that makes sense so that means that

353
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:41,680
these are probably matching what what

354
00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:42,730
they should so not only did the Assembly

355
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:44,980
assemble thing

356
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:47,529
and in the end the way that should have

357
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:49,799
but the things that assembled actually

358
00:17:47,529 --> 00:17:52,359
are matching stuff that we expect to see

359
00:17:49,799 --> 00:17:54,129
and this is all the sort of work that

360
00:17:52,359 --> 00:17:56,079
you have to go through when you've got a

361
00:17:54,130 --> 00:17:59,530
brand new organism nobody knows anything

362
00:17:56,079 --> 00:18:03,639
about Jason did a lot of work for this

363
00:17:59,529 --> 00:18:06,039
he did a good job so let's just take a

364
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:09,700
look at how much did we see versus what

365
00:18:06,039 --> 00:18:12,490
we expected to see now one of the ways

366
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:16,690
that we did our annotation the way we

367
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:20,230
labeled what we found in the powdery

368
00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:23,380
mildew genome was we did reciprocal

369
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:26,730
blasts so we searched the powdery mildew

370
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:29,380
genome with the bloom area gram Onis

371
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:32,500
transcripts or protein sequences and

372
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:34,300
then we searched the bloom area grameena

373
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:36,309
sequences with the powdery mildew

374
00:18:34,299 --> 00:18:42,970
sequences and whenever there was a

375
00:18:36,309 --> 00:18:48,089
reciprocal one-to-one match so protein a

376
00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:51,250
liked protein bloom area protein a liked

377
00:18:48,089 --> 00:18:53,139
powdery mildew protein be better than

378
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:56,319
any other powdery mildew protein and

379
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:58,570
powdery mildew protein be like bloom

380
00:18:56,319 --> 00:19:01,119
area protein a better than any other

381
00:18:58,569 --> 00:19:03,819
bloom area protein that's what we call a

382
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:06,669
reciprocal one to one best match and

383
00:19:03,819 --> 00:19:09,879
that's just one quick and dirty way to

384
00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:14,890
figure out whether those two things are

385
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:20,260
most likely to be the analogs of each

386
00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:25,380
other in each genome and so of when we

387
00:19:20,259 --> 00:19:29,259
did this we found four thousand or 4,500

388
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:33,850
reciprocal best matches in the bloom

389
00:19:29,259 --> 00:19:38,470
area genome altogether we had only six

390
00:19:33,849 --> 00:19:40,809
thousand queries so that means if flute

391
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:43,720
if powdery mildew how's about the same

392
00:19:40,809 --> 00:19:48,099
genome size and about the same number of

393
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:52,509
proteins in its transcriptome as bloom

394
00:19:48,099 --> 00:19:54,709
area then we found over two-thirds of

395
00:19:52,509 --> 00:19:56,390
them and that's pretty good

396
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:57,829
and they're not the closest relatives in

397
00:19:56,390 --> 00:19:59,590
the world I mean when you saw that tree

398
00:19:57,829 --> 00:20:02,990
there's a lot of things in between and

399
00:19:59,589 --> 00:20:05,449
fungi and you take quick so it's not bad

400
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:11,059
it's I mean for for the next closest

401
00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:13,910
relative and that was how we labeled the

402
00:20:11,059 --> 00:20:15,109
genes or the proteins that we found in

403
00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:20,240
powdery mildew

404
00:20:15,109 --> 00:20:23,869
now we also characterized these these

405
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:27,680
proteins among the all the different 56

406
00:20:23,869 --> 00:20:30,799
isolates so we took our what we had over

407
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:33,500
sequenced our reference isolate and then

408
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:36,409
compared all the other 55 isolates to it

409
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:39,890
and some of these like this one and this

410
00:20:36,410 --> 00:20:44,930
one and this one had and dis purports

411
00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:47,090
are artifacts these are not these these

412
00:20:44,930 --> 00:20:50,240
numbers of snips and in Dells are not

413
00:20:47,089 --> 00:20:53,059
because of biological fact but because

414
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:56,240
these are actually pooled samples

415
00:20:53,059 --> 00:21:00,139
themselves so these samples here

416
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:03,170
actually represent multiple isolates and

417
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:04,970
that was an artifact of how this the

418
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:06,950
laboratory work was done in the

419
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:11,089
beginning before we figured out how to

420
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:14,809
properly barcode samples but the other

421
00:21:11,089 --> 00:21:17,569
ones did have numerous snips and indels

422
00:21:14,809 --> 00:21:23,349
and the breakdown was sort of

423
00:21:17,569 --> 00:21:26,629
interesting about of all the predicted

424
00:21:23,349 --> 00:21:31,809
protein differences about 21 percent

425
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:35,990
were nonsynonymous of those 21 percent

426
00:21:31,809 --> 00:21:40,159
or 18 percent of the total were

427
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:42,620
nonsynonymous and three percent actually

428
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:47,500
looked like stop codons now these are

429
00:21:42,619 --> 00:21:51,129
all obviously based on low quality

430
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:57,170
Illumina tie high-throughput sequencing

431
00:21:51,130 --> 00:21:59,180
error and there's also the fact that

432
00:21:57,170 --> 00:22:02,350
we're conceptually translating these to

433
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:05,798
begin with as well as comparing them to

434
00:22:02,349 --> 00:22:08,469
their nearest relative protein sequence

435
00:22:05,798 --> 00:22:10,450
and in another organism that who knows

436
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:13,390
how close it really really is but it's

437
00:22:10,450 --> 00:22:16,960
our best chance so that's all we've got

438
00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:19,990
but all together what we can say is that

439
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:23,769
the regions where we found so 18 or 20

440
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:27,669
percent of those polymorphisms do look

441
00:22:23,769 --> 00:22:29,589
like they might be involved in this arms

442
00:22:27,669 --> 00:22:33,610
race between the pathogen and the host

443
00:22:29,589 --> 00:22:36,428
and so those are now the ones that

444
00:22:33,609 --> 00:22:39,569
here's the genome browser and here are

445
00:22:36,429 --> 00:22:45,330
the genes and you can see the various

446
00:22:39,569 --> 00:22:49,029
positions where there are mutations and

447
00:22:45,329 --> 00:22:52,058
these are now the regions of the genome

448
00:22:49,029 --> 00:22:58,089
that our bench colleagues can focus on

449
00:22:52,058 --> 00:23:00,759
to find possible genes related in over

450
00:22:58,089 --> 00:23:02,889
in what powdery mildew uses to overcome

451
00:23:00,759 --> 00:23:05,440
the resistance of the host to its

452
00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:07,179
infection so that was that was a fun

453
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:12,759
project okay now we're going to move

454
00:23:07,179 --> 00:23:15,990
back into plants and I was one of the

455
00:23:12,759 --> 00:23:19,210
people early on a few years ago who

456
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:22,298
started looking at how to do along with

457
00:23:19,210 --> 00:23:25,779
Paula here but in a different set of

458
00:23:22,298 --> 00:23:31,029
grape species or great populations how

459
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:37,149
to use genotyping by sequencing data to

460
00:23:31,029 --> 00:23:40,690
get information about genes responsible

461
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:44,080
for traits and so one of the projects I

462
00:23:40,690 --> 00:23:46,659
did was I compared the tassel pipeline

463
00:23:44,079 --> 00:23:49,990
which is pure genome-wide Association

464
00:23:46,659 --> 00:23:51,309
mapping and traditional QTL mapping just

465
00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:54,849
to see what would work and the

466
00:23:51,308 --> 00:23:59,259
population I used in this case segregate

467
00:23:54,849 --> 00:24:04,918
it was two populations actually y1 by y3

468
00:23:59,259 --> 00:24:08,048
so the blue versus the red and then y1

469
00:24:04,919 --> 00:24:11,559
versus Y four so the blue versus the

470
00:24:08,048 --> 00:24:14,500
green and so for various traits that had

471
00:24:11,558 --> 00:24:17,849
to do with table grape quality

472
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:20,950
so in other words less seeds or no seeds

473
00:24:17,849 --> 00:24:22,599
Barry sighs that sort of thing which is

474
00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:25,120
all what you care about is you want a

475
00:24:22,599 --> 00:24:26,649
big berry with no seeds in it or at

476
00:24:25,119 --> 00:24:28,239
least that's what the public wants so

477
00:24:26,650 --> 00:24:31,120
that's what David ramming Lots because

478
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:35,650
he's breeding table grapes and so our

479
00:24:31,119 --> 00:24:38,979
populations had 71 offspring between

480
00:24:35,650 --> 00:24:41,650
these two individuals and 17 offspring

481
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:45,069
between these two individuals we

482
00:24:41,650 --> 00:24:48,640
genotyped these two individuals three

483
00:24:45,069 --> 00:24:51,819
times each and this individual twice and

484
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:55,059
that becomes important later when when

485
00:24:51,819 --> 00:24:56,859
you try to do QTL mapping you need in

486
00:24:55,058 --> 00:24:59,019
order to create a genetic map you really

487
00:24:56,859 --> 00:25:01,808
do if you're doing GBS you really do

488
00:24:59,019 --> 00:25:04,658
need to get deeper coverage of the

489
00:25:01,808 --> 00:25:07,210
parents so let's just talk real briefly

490
00:25:04,659 --> 00:25:08,950
about genotyping by sequencing probably

491
00:25:07,210 --> 00:25:11,140
most of you here have seen this a

492
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:14,980
million times some of you have even

493
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:18,220
displayed this slide before yourself

494
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:20,500
I've seen you do it at PEG but I

495
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:22,440
borrowed the slide from the workshops

496
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:26,288
that the Institute of genomic diversity

497
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:29,440
provides and that's because it's a good

498
00:25:26,288 --> 00:25:33,970
slide basically genotyping by sequencing

499
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:37,419
is a way of getting polymorphism out of

500
00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:39,640
a genome with just using restriction

501
00:25:37,419 --> 00:25:41,650
enzyme fragments and high-throughput

502
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:43,440
technology I'm not going to go into a

503
00:25:41,650 --> 00:25:47,169
whole lot more detail about it right now

504
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:50,710
but basically what you need to know is

505
00:25:47,169 --> 00:25:53,559
we do genome complexity reduction by

506
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:56,558
choosing the restriction enzyme so in

507
00:25:53,558 --> 00:25:58,928
other words the way we pick where the

508
00:25:56,558 --> 00:26:00,700
genotyping is going to occur is by what

509
00:25:58,929 --> 00:26:04,298
the restriction enzyme site is going to

510
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:07,210
be the cuts and then we use that

511
00:26:04,298 --> 00:26:12,750
information to figure out where the

512
00:26:07,210 --> 00:26:15,460
polymorphisms are and figure out the

513
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:17,349
yeah figure out the polymorphism so

514
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:20,140
you're doing marker discovery and

515
00:26:17,349 --> 00:26:22,480
genotyping simultaneously the advantage

516
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:24,880
of this over chips if you haven't heard

517
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:26,980
this already is if you have a snip chip

518
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:27,470
you have to already know what the

519
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:29,690
diverse

520
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:31,538
you expect or what the polymorphisms you

521
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:33,558
expect to see are going to be otherwise

522
00:26:31,538 --> 00:26:36,200
you won't see them because you're not

523
00:26:33,558 --> 00:26:39,740
asking for them this way if it's there

524
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:41,750
in a restriction site and you cover the

525
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:45,679
genome deeply enough you will see it and

526
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:47,630
so you can either have a loss of a site

527
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:50,090
which is a lot harder to see because

528
00:26:47,630 --> 00:26:52,520
this day these data are very patchy or

529
00:26:50,089 --> 00:26:54,740
what you can have is a difference in

530
00:26:52,519 --> 00:26:58,970
sequence between two sites and that's

531
00:26:54,740 --> 00:27:01,400
much much easier to ascertain just as a

532
00:26:58,970 --> 00:27:04,579
side note I tried to do a project for

533
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:06,590
somebody once where sample2 was

534
00:27:04,579 --> 00:27:08,750
gamma-irradiated so they were big

535
00:27:06,589 --> 00:27:11,149
they're supposed to be deletions and the

536
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:15,409
other genome and it completely failed

537
00:27:11,150 --> 00:27:19,370
with GBS so it if you're thinking of

538
00:27:15,409 --> 00:27:23,659
trying to find deletions by GBS talk to

539
00:27:19,369 --> 00:27:26,808
me first because there's a lot of issues

540
00:27:23,659 --> 00:27:28,640
and and we've it a really hard good

541
00:27:26,808 --> 00:27:31,069
solid try and I wasn't able to do that

542
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:33,890
so I would not actually consider it very

543
00:27:31,069 --> 00:27:36,529
good at finding deletions but it is good

544
00:27:33,890 --> 00:27:39,590
at finding polymorphisms when the site

545
00:27:36,529 --> 00:27:42,200
is found between multiple organisms so

546
00:27:39,589 --> 00:27:44,869
it's pretty cheap it scales well it

547
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:46,669
there's no ascertain 'men bias and then

548
00:27:44,869 --> 00:27:48,168
lab wise is nice because you don't have

549
00:27:46,669 --> 00:27:49,730
to size fractionate the way you would

550
00:27:48,169 --> 00:27:51,980
have to do with rad tags which is

551
00:27:49,730 --> 00:27:54,500
another way of doing this sort of data

552
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:57,288
gathering and you can pick your

553
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:59,720
restriction enzyme based on how

554
00:27:57,288 --> 00:28:01,849
frequently it cuts and whether or not

555
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:03,319
it's methylation sensitive and so on so

556
00:28:01,849 --> 00:28:04,969
if you're trying to avoid certain parts

557
00:28:03,319 --> 00:28:06,428
of the genome that might be methylated

558
00:28:04,970 --> 00:28:08,900
say you want to go for the euchromatin

559
00:28:06,429 --> 00:28:10,580
I'm probably dating myself using that

560
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:12,110
term right if you want to go for the

561
00:28:10,579 --> 00:28:15,918
parts of the genome that have the genes

562
00:28:12,109 --> 00:28:17,538
in them versus the non-coding part of

563
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:19,190
the genome you might want to go for

564
00:28:17,538 --> 00:28:21,470
methylation sensitive enzymes or

565
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:23,509
something like that so that's what's

566
00:28:21,470 --> 00:28:26,569
nice about that and so you can pick how

567
00:28:23,509 --> 00:28:28,669
often you get a marker and so on so

568
00:28:26,569 --> 00:28:32,960
let's go back to these two great

569
00:28:28,669 --> 00:28:36,380
populations called and mapped genotypes

570
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:39,450
there are 19 chromosomes in grape with

571
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:42,390
the QTL analysis

572
00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:45,569
there were many fewer markers called for

573
00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:47,340
each chromosome and we could we

574
00:28:45,569 --> 00:28:49,769
obviously were able to map them because

575
00:28:47,339 --> 00:28:54,209
we're using join map to map these things

576
00:28:49,769 --> 00:29:00,240
with tassel which was a G wasp method we

577
00:28:54,210 --> 00:29:05,000
used all of the tax and not so for for

578
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:07,920
these work this for this version we used

579
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:10,019
just the biggest mapping population the

580
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:13,650
71 offspring for the G us we're able to

581
00:29:10,019 --> 00:29:15,629
throw all the data in and genetic

582
00:29:13,650 --> 00:29:19,170
mapping wasn't done we just tried to

583
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:21,900
assume where the markers fell based on

584
00:29:19,170 --> 00:29:24,990
the grape genome sequence that's been

585
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:27,480
published now that's also problematic

586
00:29:24,990 --> 00:29:30,660
because we know that some of these

587
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:34,680
markers that when we did our mapping

588
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:37,680
with join map that those markers did not

589
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:41,400
show up where the grape genome assembly

590
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:43,110
said they work so when you use this type

591
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:47,009
of method you have to watch out for that

592
00:29:43,109 --> 00:29:49,709
sort of thing but the bottom line was

593
00:29:47,009 --> 00:29:51,390
that no matter which method you used it

594
00:29:49,710 --> 00:29:53,970
often found the same region of the

595
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:57,810
genome so the seedless nough snowin

596
00:29:53,970 --> 00:30:02,130
seedless no skewed seed less this QTL on

597
00:29:57,809 --> 00:30:05,849
linkage group 18 was found both with

598
00:30:02,130 --> 00:30:09,330
tassel which are the green dots and with

599
00:30:05,849 --> 00:30:11,519
map QTL which are the blue dots so if

600
00:30:09,329 --> 00:30:14,069
you have enough data and the data and

601
00:30:11,519 --> 00:30:22,039
the system is robust enough you will

602
00:30:14,069 --> 00:30:22,039
find your your associations either way

603
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:29,150
so just to summarize the difference

604
00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:31,849
between these two methods if you're

605
00:30:29,150 --> 00:30:34,940
doing traditional mapping you'll get

606
00:30:31,849 --> 00:30:36,379
about ten times less markers because you

607
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:41,240
need to be confident in how they are

608
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:43,670
phased between the two parents it

609
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:46,039
requires a high depth high read depth

610
00:30:43,670 --> 00:30:49,700
for the parents so remember I said we G

611
00:30:46,039 --> 00:30:51,680
know typed y1 + y3 each three times and

612
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:54,380
if we had not done that we would have

613
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:56,299
had problems doing traditional mapping

614
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:58,070
and there was another project that was

615
00:30:56,299 --> 00:31:01,009
trying to do the same thing with a

616
00:30:58,069 --> 00:31:04,119
different population in grape and Palo

617
00:31:01,009 --> 00:31:06,289
remembers and that was tricky because

618
00:31:04,119 --> 00:31:08,449
those parents and only been genotyped

619
00:31:06,289 --> 00:31:10,490
once so I tried running that dataset

620
00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:12,860
through my pipeline and I was not able

621
00:31:10,490 --> 00:31:14,630
to get a genetic map because I didn't

622
00:31:12,859 --> 00:31:18,199
have enough information for what the

623
00:31:14,630 --> 00:31:20,060
markers should be according to what the

624
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:24,799
parents were because we didn't parents

625
00:31:20,059 --> 00:31:26,869
weren't sequence deeply enough and with

626
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:30,049
the traditional mapping approach you can

627
00:31:26,869 --> 00:31:31,759
create the map you don't have to you

628
00:31:30,049 --> 00:31:35,089
don't have to have an existing map or

629
00:31:31,759 --> 00:31:37,759
assembly with G wasps you got a lot more

630
00:31:35,089 --> 00:31:39,709
markers and it's a it's a brute-force

631
00:31:37,759 --> 00:31:42,440
method more it uses just the sheer

632
00:31:39,710 --> 00:31:45,470
number of markers to work and it allows

633
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:48,860
imputation this one this method we did

634
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:51,650
not do imputed in this method you can

635
00:31:48,859 --> 00:31:53,809
genotype parents once and that might be

636
00:31:51,650 --> 00:31:56,509
good if you had say a big open

637
00:31:53,809 --> 00:32:00,200
pollinated population out in nature and

638
00:31:56,509 --> 00:32:04,099
you're just trying to find out how the

639
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:05,809
traits were associated in that or if you

640
00:32:04,099 --> 00:32:06,709
had a population that you inherited from

641
00:32:05,809 --> 00:32:08,869
another breeder

642
00:32:06,710 --> 00:32:10,700
and you weren't really sure how the

643
00:32:08,869 --> 00:32:12,289
individuals were related because you

644
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:14,569
couldn't find their notebooks or

645
00:32:12,289 --> 00:32:16,609
something like that but it was a

646
00:32:14,569 --> 00:32:18,139
valuable enough population of spend time

647
00:32:16,609 --> 00:32:20,659
on because it had the trait you wanted

648
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:25,340
so G who else would probably be better

649
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:27,590
for that now it turns out that the

650
00:32:25,339 --> 00:32:30,559
Vettes gen project is actually working

651
00:32:27,589 --> 00:32:32,168
on a way to do mapping genetic mapping

652
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:35,499
from the

653
00:32:32,169 --> 00:32:37,720
data without having to go through some

654
00:32:35,499 --> 00:32:40,358
of this process and I'm really excited

655
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:42,159
to see how their unique pipeline will

656
00:32:40,358 --> 00:32:44,408
work and some of the projects I'm gonna

657
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:47,049
be that I'm working on at the present so

658
00:32:44,409 --> 00:32:49,720
stay tuned and I'll let you know how

659
00:32:47,048 --> 00:32:52,989
that works out okay we're gonna switch

660
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:55,058
gears again but this time only to a

661
00:32:52,989 --> 00:32:56,919
different great population and I just

662
00:32:55,058 --> 00:32:59,378
want to show you this is one of those

663
00:32:56,919 --> 00:33:00,850
slides that I had to make purposely

664
00:32:59,378 --> 00:33:05,259
vague because I know this is going to

665
00:33:00,849 --> 00:33:08,439
end up on YouTube we have mapped a great

666
00:33:05,259 --> 00:33:11,889
trait a developmental trait to one of

667
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:14,649
the chromosomes with really strong QTL

668
00:33:11,888 --> 00:33:18,308
evidence using this same technology

669
00:33:14,648 --> 00:33:21,878
where we take the GBS data we filter it

670
00:33:18,308 --> 00:33:24,428
down and then we do traditional genetic

671
00:33:21,878 --> 00:33:27,368
mapping and QTL mapping with it and this

672
00:33:24,429 --> 00:33:29,950
population is beautiful it's got 142

673
00:33:27,368 --> 00:33:33,339
offspring which is huge for a clonal

674
00:33:29,950 --> 00:33:36,100
crop it's great we ended up with a

675
00:33:33,339 --> 00:33:38,349
little over 2,000 markers on a paternal

676
00:33:36,099 --> 00:33:43,028
map because the trait is segregating

677
00:33:38,349 --> 00:33:45,998
between in the in the father and we got

678
00:33:43,028 --> 00:33:48,009
a decent number of markers in each of

679
00:33:45,999 --> 00:33:52,200
the linkage groups about a hundred or so

680
00:33:48,009 --> 00:33:54,970
and so here's here's a trait and

681
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:56,019
hopefully by this time next year I'll be

682
00:33:54,970 --> 00:34:01,079
able to tell you what it is

683
00:33:56,019 --> 00:34:05,108
openly because we'll publish it okay

684
00:34:01,079 --> 00:34:07,089
finally one other thing I thought would

685
00:34:05,108 --> 00:34:09,308
be fun to tell you about is sometimes

686
00:34:07,089 --> 00:34:13,628
when I'm doing the type of work I'm

687
00:34:09,309 --> 00:34:15,849
doing there aren't tools to do what I

688
00:34:13,628 --> 00:34:19,418
want to do and so part of my job

689
00:34:15,849 --> 00:34:20,409
sometimes not so often most of the time

690
00:34:19,418 --> 00:34:22,838
because most of the time there are other

691
00:34:20,409 --> 00:34:24,789
research labs out in the world doing

692
00:34:22,838 --> 00:34:26,710
what the same kind of thing and I can

693
00:34:24,789 --> 00:34:29,019
take their tool and use it for our

694
00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:31,720
purposes but sometimes there isn't a

695
00:34:29,019 --> 00:34:34,838
tool like that or I don't know about one

696
00:34:31,719 --> 00:34:36,368
or I think of one and then I make it so

697
00:34:34,838 --> 00:34:39,429
I just thought I'd mention this one to

698
00:34:36,369 --> 00:34:41,950
you guys just for fun so in this tool it

699
00:34:39,429 --> 00:34:44,048
was a it was a it was came out an idea I

700
00:34:41,949 --> 00:34:44,939
got from attending Carl severs course so

701
00:34:44,048 --> 00:34:47,940
any

702
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:49,789
here who hasn't attended or thought

703
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:52,619
about attending Carl Siebert's

704
00:34:49,789 --> 00:34:54,898
chemometrics course ought to think about

705
00:34:52,619 --> 00:34:57,960
it especially if you ever spend time in

706
00:34:54,898 --> 00:35:01,199
Geneva because it's not just about wine

707
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:04,318
and beer characteristics it's about how

708
00:35:01,199 --> 00:35:07,259
to do multi-dimensional analysis and I

709
00:35:04,318 --> 00:35:10,318
am not trained in statistics I'm a

710
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:12,329
geneticist you know I was training like

711
00:35:10,318 --> 00:35:13,949
molecular genetics and a little bit I

712
00:35:12,329 --> 00:35:16,190
had to teach classical genetics when I

713
00:35:13,949 --> 00:35:19,500
was at was on as a grad student but

714
00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:22,079
statistics is not something I'm that

715
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:25,318
strong in and so I really enjoyed taking

716
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:27,750
Carl sieverts course in Geneva and one

717
00:35:25,318 --> 00:35:29,460
of the methods that he taught us about

718
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:31,889
was how to do principal components

719
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:34,920
analysis and I started thinking about

720
00:35:31,889 --> 00:35:40,049
this and I thought you know genetically

721
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:42,900
if you have two homozygotes and a hair a

722
00:35:40,050 --> 00:35:45,839
zygote between them from a genetic

723
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:48,420
perspective the heterozygote is actually

724
00:35:45,838 --> 00:35:53,250
genetically intermediate right if the

725
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:57,300
traits are codominant so why not do

726
00:35:53,250 --> 00:36:01,588
Pease code those those genotypes as ones

727
00:35:57,300 --> 00:36:04,318
and zeros and twos and treat it like PCA

728
00:36:01,588 --> 00:36:08,789
and see if you get correlations between

729
00:36:04,318 --> 00:36:10,588
the genotype and a treat or a behavior

730
00:36:08,789 --> 00:36:13,108
or some kind of characteristic that

731
00:36:10,588 --> 00:36:15,779
you're interested in so we tried it and

732
00:36:13,108 --> 00:36:19,710
it works and what's really cool about it

733
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:23,760
is that it's a way to assess genetic

734
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:26,269
correlation between the markers and the

735
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:29,430
characteristics because you can get a

736
00:36:26,269 --> 00:36:32,699
principal components loading plot so you

737
00:36:29,429 --> 00:36:35,789
can actually say okay which principle

738
00:36:32,699 --> 00:36:38,068
coordinate actually separates my sample

739
00:36:35,789 --> 00:36:40,500
according to say fruit size or something

740
00:36:38,068 --> 00:36:42,029
and if and if and if one of them does

741
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:43,318
and the bigger fruits are over here and

742
00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:45,359
the littler fruits are over here

743
00:36:43,318 --> 00:36:48,088
according to that one principal

744
00:36:45,358 --> 00:36:51,650
coordinate then you can actually take

745
00:36:48,088 --> 00:36:54,869
this the data and go back and ask which

746
00:36:51,650 --> 00:36:56,940
markers contributed to that principal

747
00:36:54,869 --> 00:36:58,650
component which which ones are actually

748
00:36:56,940 --> 00:37:01,740
giving which genotype

749
00:36:58,650 --> 00:37:03,509
which alleles are giving you that axis

750
00:37:01,739 --> 00:37:05,788
and that tells you what part of the

751
00:37:03,509 --> 00:37:07,829
genome might be involved so it's a kind

752
00:37:05,789 --> 00:37:09,599
of a cool thing to do the other thing

753
00:37:07,829 --> 00:37:11,480
that's nice about it and the examples

754
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:14,099
I'll show you here are from this

755
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:16,440
application and that is it's a direct

756
00:37:14,099 --> 00:37:18,990
way to visualize genetic relationships

757
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:20,999
among organisms because you can just

758
00:37:18,989 --> 00:37:23,489
plot them according to their principal

759
00:37:20,998 --> 00:37:25,558
components genetically and this

760
00:37:23,489 --> 00:37:29,389
different the spacing you see is the

761
00:37:25,559 --> 00:37:33,150
genetic spacing it's the actual like

762
00:37:29,389 --> 00:37:37,679
amalgam of or addition of all the

763
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:39,599
different genetic markers and it's so

764
00:37:37,679 --> 00:37:41,009
it's not multi-dimensional scaling where

765
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:42,720
it's just taking all the data and trying

766
00:37:41,009 --> 00:37:45,509
to like figure out a way to stretch it

767
00:37:42,719 --> 00:37:47,278
out no these are the actual physical

768
00:37:45,509 --> 00:37:48,960
points in space triangular you know

769
00:37:47,278 --> 00:37:53,818
triangulated points in space that you

770
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:55,710
get when you'd look at genetic the the

771
00:37:53,818 --> 00:37:57,509
some of the genetic differences among

772
00:37:55,710 --> 00:37:59,519
these organisms according to these

773
00:37:57,509 --> 00:38:05,429
different components that separate them

774
00:37:59,518 --> 00:38:08,518
so this has been published and the

775
00:38:05,429 --> 00:38:12,239
example in the paper is tomato data so I

776
00:38:08,518 --> 00:38:14,189
promised tomato data here it is in our

777
00:38:12,239 --> 00:38:18,139
collection in Geneva that Larry

778
00:38:14,190 --> 00:38:20,548
Robertson curates we have samples of

779
00:38:18,139 --> 00:38:22,498
tomato DNA it will samples a tomato

780
00:38:20,548 --> 00:38:24,210
which obviously contain the DNA see

781
00:38:22,498 --> 00:38:26,038
that's where I'm a geneticist because

782
00:38:24,210 --> 00:38:29,849
I'm like we have samples of tomato DNA

783
00:38:26,039 --> 00:38:34,609
in the actual tomato plants yeah and the

784
00:38:29,849 --> 00:38:37,769
question is can we genetically tell

785
00:38:34,608 --> 00:38:41,759
which samples are closer to the origin

786
00:38:37,768 --> 00:38:44,329
of domestication so let me see if I

787
00:38:41,759 --> 00:38:47,869
still have this slide here and

788
00:38:44,329 --> 00:38:49,489
no I don't okay so let me explain what

789
00:38:47,869 --> 00:38:50,690
happened here with tomatoes those of you

790
00:38:49,489 --> 00:38:52,909
who saw Joanne's

791
00:38:50,690 --> 00:38:56,179
talk last week saw a really nice cartoon

792
00:38:52,909 --> 00:39:00,859
of this but basically tomatoes were

793
00:38:56,179 --> 00:39:03,679
domesticated in three general Eric parts

794
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:05,900
or three place that overlaps with Chile

795
00:39:03,679 --> 00:39:08,809
Ecuador and Peru so this little spot in

796
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:11,030
South America that's where all the wild

797
00:39:08,809 --> 00:39:13,219
tomato diversity is that's where people

798
00:39:11,030 --> 00:39:16,070
came and said oh we could eat these tiny

799
00:39:13,219 --> 00:39:18,949
little things and then they started like

800
00:39:16,070 --> 00:39:22,630
eating them and somehow in the dark

801
00:39:18,949 --> 00:39:26,299
history of tomato they started becoming

802
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:29,720
domesticated and eventually the better

803
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:32,690
ones started spreading and so we have

804
00:39:29,719 --> 00:39:34,579
samples from Chile Ecuador and Peru we

805
00:39:32,690 --> 00:39:37,190
also have samples from the countries

806
00:39:34,579 --> 00:39:40,130
contiguous to them and then what

807
00:39:37,190 --> 00:39:42,980
happened was the conquistadors came from

808
00:39:40,130 --> 00:39:44,420
Europe to South America and said oh what

809
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:46,340
are these things you people are eating

810
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:51,170
let us take them back so they took them

811
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:54,860
to Europe and that was a bottleneck in

812
00:39:51,170 --> 00:39:56,570
in the jeanna in the diversity of

813
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:58,900
tomatoes so only a subset of the

814
00:39:56,570 --> 00:40:03,670
tomatoes got to go and visit Europe and

815
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:06,559
then when people from Europe started

816
00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:08,960
colonizing North America they brought

817
00:40:06,559 --> 00:40:11,110
some tomatoes from Europe up to North

818
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:14,179
America so there have been two major

819
00:40:11,110 --> 00:40:17,780
bottlenecks in the history of tomato

820
00:40:14,179 --> 00:40:20,569
that led to the germ plasm that we have

821
00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:23,900
here now subsequently there's been other

822
00:40:20,570 --> 00:40:25,820
things like int regressions from other

823
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:30,019
wild species back in that started in the

824
00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:34,910
1940s but before 1940 if you saw tomato

825
00:40:30,019 --> 00:40:37,909
it was usually most diverse if it was

826
00:40:34,909 --> 00:40:40,730
from where tomatoes were domesticated a

827
00:40:37,909 --> 00:40:42,500
little less allelic diversity in the

828
00:40:40,730 --> 00:40:44,630
sample in Europe and then even less in

829
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:46,159
North America and that was the

830
00:40:44,630 --> 00:40:48,140
conventional wisdom and the question was

831
00:40:46,159 --> 00:40:53,440
could we see this in the tomatoes and

832
00:40:48,139 --> 00:40:56,440
our collections so we looked at

833
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:59,139
50 different accessions 14 were from

834
00:40:56,440 --> 00:41:02,559
Chile Ecuador and Peru six were from

835
00:40:59,139 --> 00:41:06,489
countries next to Chile Ecuador and Peru

836
00:41:02,559 --> 00:41:10,588
and 30 were from places other than that

837
00:41:06,489 --> 00:41:12,789
like other continents and sure enough

838
00:41:10,588 --> 00:41:14,980
first of all it's kind of interesting

839
00:41:12,789 --> 00:41:17,920
the first principal component explained

840
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:19,420
20% of the variation in the data in the

841
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:22,030
genetic data the second principal

842
00:41:19,420 --> 00:41:25,269
component explained 10% more and the

843
00:41:22,030 --> 00:41:28,060
third explained six percent more so only

844
00:41:25,269 --> 00:41:30,219
probably I mean you don't really need to

845
00:41:28,059 --> 00:41:32,679
look deeper than three unless you wanted

846
00:41:30,219 --> 00:41:34,509
to say compare fruit size or something

847
00:41:32,679 --> 00:41:36,399
like that and maybe one of the

848
00:41:34,510 --> 00:41:38,560
components later than that might explain

849
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:39,940
the specific kind of variation you're

850
00:41:38,559 --> 00:41:42,909
interested in but if you're looking at

851
00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:45,210
just the diversity among the samples and

852
00:41:42,909 --> 00:41:47,618
not looking for certain traits traits

853
00:41:45,210 --> 00:41:49,510
diversity in a certain trait then this

854
00:41:47,619 --> 00:41:52,180
is probably good enough just to stop in

855
00:41:49,510 --> 00:41:56,010
the first three and sure enough the

856
00:41:52,179 --> 00:42:01,239
biggest cloud are these yellow dots

857
00:41:56,010 --> 00:42:05,680
these represent the 14 samples from the

858
00:42:01,239 --> 00:42:08,439
primary center of diversity and the red

859
00:42:05,679 --> 00:42:10,389
dots are a little bit less inside of

860
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:13,329
that cloud they're subsets of that cloud

861
00:42:10,389 --> 00:42:16,480
those are the ones that made it to

862
00:42:13,329 --> 00:42:19,900
places like Argentina where they're

863
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:22,329
contiguous to Chile say but not in the

864
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:26,440
in the center of diversity or where they

865
00:42:22,329 --> 00:42:30,369
were domesticated originally and finally

866
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:33,130
when you look at the last few which is

867
00:42:30,369 --> 00:42:35,440
the last 30 it's hard to see in this

868
00:42:33,130 --> 00:42:37,869
picture but actually that is you can

869
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:39,960
actually rotate these plots if you use R

870
00:42:37,869 --> 00:42:43,660
which is a really nice staff package

871
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:47,530
that's free you can see that the blue

872
00:42:43,659 --> 00:42:50,679
dots are actually inside of the yellow

873
00:42:47,530 --> 00:42:54,280
dots and actually smaller than this big

874
00:42:50,679 --> 00:42:58,779
red disc and so actually it worked and

875
00:42:54,280 --> 00:43:02,140
you can actually see that the tomatoes

876
00:42:58,780 --> 00:43:04,109
that come from the places furthest from

877
00:43:02,139 --> 00:43:06,259
where they were originally domesticated

878
00:43:04,108 --> 00:43:10,009
have the least

879
00:43:06,260 --> 00:43:14,420
diversity this method also works in

880
00:43:10,010 --> 00:43:16,130
grapes we did a big study where we

881
00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:18,079
looked at a hundred and twenty

882
00:43:16,130 --> 00:43:21,170
accessions of grapes both in our

883
00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:24,559
collection and some from China that were

884
00:43:21,170 --> 00:43:27,409
brought by our collaborator and we asked

885
00:43:24,559 --> 00:43:30,170
how do these things look if you sequence

886
00:43:27,409 --> 00:43:35,089
30 different genes and you throw their

887
00:43:30,170 --> 00:43:36,829
their sequences into this PCA thing what

888
00:43:35,090 --> 00:43:40,400
does it look like well here are the

889
00:43:36,829 --> 00:43:43,909
first three principal components and the

890
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:47,510
North American grapes are in this pale

891
00:43:43,909 --> 00:43:50,989
blue color the european grapes are in

892
00:43:47,510 --> 00:43:54,260
this sort of orange color and the asian

893
00:43:50,989 --> 00:43:56,000
grapes are in the blue color and there

894
00:43:54,260 --> 00:43:59,600
are a few that are known hybrids that

895
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:01,670
are other colors and again what's really

896
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:04,159
interesting to see is that some of the

897
00:44:01,670 --> 00:44:08,180
North American grapes that come from the

898
00:44:04,159 --> 00:44:10,909
part of North America near Asia are a

899
00:44:08,179 --> 00:44:12,949
little more like the Asian grapes kind

900
00:44:10,909 --> 00:44:16,159
of interesting and we were also able to

901
00:44:12,949 --> 00:44:18,349
show with this we were able to see in

902
00:44:16,159 --> 00:44:22,210
some cases where things that were

903
00:44:18,349 --> 00:44:25,579
labeled as North American were probably

904
00:44:22,210 --> 00:44:29,000
hybrids with vanilla like this one here

905
00:44:25,579 --> 00:44:30,949
so it's a it's a it's a fun it's it's

906
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:34,340
fun sometimes to develop your own tools

907
00:44:30,949 --> 00:44:36,889
to answer questions about what you're

908
00:44:34,340 --> 00:44:38,750
seeing in the data and this project is

909
00:44:36,889 --> 00:44:41,449
being written up by Heidi schwa Nagar

910
00:44:38,750 --> 00:44:43,429
and a team of us in Geneva actually it's

911
00:44:41,449 --> 00:44:46,309
been written up and it's since we're in

912
00:44:43,429 --> 00:44:49,159
the pools of submitting and resubmitting

913
00:44:46,309 --> 00:44:53,539
at the moment so that's a fun fun thing

914
00:44:49,159 --> 00:44:55,099
too so looks like I'm going to leave

915
00:44:53,539 --> 00:44:58,789
enough time for students to ask

916
00:44:55,099 --> 00:45:00,769
questions which will be nice we have

917
00:44:58,789 --> 00:45:04,309
some other projects in the works just

918
00:45:00,769 --> 00:45:08,199
big ones I've just started surveying

919
00:45:04,309 --> 00:45:14,110
apple germ plasm for srna's alleles and

920
00:45:08,199 --> 00:45:16,599
this is coming out of a project that was

921
00:45:14,110 --> 00:45:19,360
spearheaded by Gallo and Zhang

922
00:45:16,599 --> 00:45:21,339
and Shawn miles that you may remember

923
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:25,180
from working with Edie buckler on a

924
00:45:21,340 --> 00:45:27,700
grape snip diversity and what they're

925
00:45:25,179 --> 00:45:29,230
doing is or what we've all as a group

926
00:45:27,699 --> 00:45:32,139
done and this also involves

927
00:45:29,230 --> 00:45:36,630
collaborators in Fort Collins too we've

928
00:45:32,139 --> 00:45:40,029
taken 42 species and 1600 accessions

929
00:45:36,630 --> 00:45:45,490
from our collection as well as some

930
00:45:40,030 --> 00:45:46,960
other doméstica proprietary doméstica

931
00:45:45,489 --> 00:45:50,259
varieties that we don't have art

932
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:55,090
collection and done a huge gb/s survey

933
00:45:50,260 --> 00:45:56,980
of them and two enzymes were used

934
00:45:55,090 --> 00:45:59,680
remember I mentioned that in GPS you can

935
00:45:56,980 --> 00:46:01,809
use different enzymes you can also

936
00:45:59,679 --> 00:46:07,440
combine enzymes to get different

937
00:46:01,809 --> 00:46:10,090
coverage of the genome and of that data

938
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:12,280
what Shawn and his team are doing are

939
00:46:10,090 --> 00:46:15,039
looking at the diversity among the apple

940
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:18,550
germ plasm but because these data

941
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:21,940
involves small snippets of sequence it's

942
00:46:18,550 --> 00:46:23,980
also possible to hunt in them for genes

943
00:46:21,940 --> 00:46:25,960
of interest known genes of interest and

944
00:46:23,980 --> 00:46:31,719
so one thing that I'm doing with Gennaro

945
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:35,380
Fazio is hunting for markers in the

946
00:46:31,719 --> 00:46:37,209
region of the S RNAs alleles and I guess

947
00:46:35,380 --> 00:46:40,470
I should explain what the srna's alleles

948
00:46:37,210 --> 00:46:45,670
are and why this is important Apple is

949
00:46:40,469 --> 00:46:48,039
self incompatible so if you want to make

950
00:46:45,670 --> 00:46:50,470
an apple that breeds true the only way

951
00:46:48,039 --> 00:46:53,289
to do that is to graft it that's why it

952
00:46:50,469 --> 00:46:54,849
is a clonal crop okay now the many of

953
00:46:53,289 --> 00:46:58,420
you may already know this but in case

954
00:46:54,849 --> 00:47:02,349
you didn't now you do if you want to

955
00:46:58,420 --> 00:47:06,730
breed one Apple to another it has to

956
00:47:02,349 --> 00:47:09,789
have a different s RNA Salil and that's

957
00:47:06,730 --> 00:47:12,849
why for example when you grow an apple

958
00:47:09,789 --> 00:47:14,800
orchard you need to have other than

959
00:47:12,849 --> 00:47:17,079
something say you have a big bunch of

960
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:18,730
big big bunch of Golden Delicious trees

961
00:47:17,079 --> 00:47:20,019
and you want Golden Delicious apples

962
00:47:18,730 --> 00:47:22,690
well if you don't include at least one

963
00:47:20,019 --> 00:47:25,210
crabapple or some other non Golden

964
00:47:22,690 --> 00:47:28,329
Delicious pollinator you will not get

965
00:47:25,210 --> 00:47:29,690
apples at all okay is that clear

966
00:47:28,329 --> 00:47:32,239
great

967
00:47:29,690 --> 00:47:35,530
all right so also suppose you want to

968
00:47:32,239 --> 00:47:37,789
make apple germ plasm or breed apples

969
00:47:35,530 --> 00:47:39,220
you don't just want to grow them you

970
00:47:37,789 --> 00:47:42,739
want to breed them well you need to know

971
00:47:39,219 --> 00:47:45,649
what the resistance alleles are right so

972
00:47:42,739 --> 00:47:47,629
what we're hoping is that once we survey

973
00:47:45,650 --> 00:47:50,930
our collection for all these different

974
00:47:47,630 --> 00:47:53,869
possible alleles that we may be able to

975
00:47:50,929 --> 00:47:56,329
suggest good alternative breeding

976
00:47:53,869 --> 00:47:58,099
parents for creating new varieties and I

977
00:47:56,329 --> 00:48:00,380
see some of the people who work on Apple

978
00:47:58,099 --> 00:48:05,210
reading nodding so I'm on track and I'm

979
00:48:00,380 --> 00:48:07,700
glad they agree so anyway that's that's

980
00:48:05,210 --> 00:48:09,409
one project that we're doing will also

981
00:48:07,699 --> 00:48:11,029
hunt because I still have those friends

982
00:48:09,409 --> 00:48:13,339
remember way back when I talked about

983
00:48:11,030 --> 00:48:15,530
the RDAs and the fire blight resistance

984
00:48:13,340 --> 00:48:18,890
well those those colleagues down there

985
00:48:15,530 --> 00:48:21,710
and West Virginia are also interested in

986
00:48:18,889 --> 00:48:25,099
disease resistance genes still so once

987
00:48:21,710 --> 00:48:28,789
we've figured out how to survey these

988
00:48:25,099 --> 00:48:31,400
GBS markers for srna's alleles will

989
00:48:28,789 --> 00:48:33,110
branch off into other things and one

990
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:36,110
might be fire blight resistance and

991
00:48:33,110 --> 00:48:40,760
there may be say dwarfing traits or

992
00:48:36,110 --> 00:48:44,210
other interesting traits that we want in

993
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:45,980
apples and we'll hunt for them because

994
00:48:44,210 --> 00:48:48,409
it's a nice big database and then we'll

995
00:48:45,980 --> 00:48:52,429
be able to suggest parents another

996
00:48:48,409 --> 00:48:57,069
project that's started is Lance Cal

997
00:48:52,429 --> 00:49:01,480
Davidson has a person that he's hired

998
00:48:57,070 --> 00:49:04,430
for hired into his lab who wants a

999
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:06,710
master's degree in bioinformatics so

1000
00:49:04,429 --> 00:49:08,569
she's actually now in this case instead

1001
00:49:06,710 --> 00:49:10,429
of RIT giving us a student we're

1002
00:49:08,570 --> 00:49:11,780
actually giving RIT a student but it's

1003
00:49:10,429 --> 00:49:15,409
still going to work in the similar way

1004
00:49:11,780 --> 00:49:19,340
she's enrolling an RIT in bioinformatics

1005
00:49:15,409 --> 00:49:22,339
and Lance and I will work together with

1006
00:49:19,340 --> 00:49:24,500
our colleagues at RIT to mentor her

1007
00:49:22,340 --> 00:49:27,850
through that process and she's working

1008
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:30,889
on the pathogen botrytis cinerea

1009
00:49:27,849 --> 00:49:32,809
so there's some there's some fun other

1010
00:49:30,889 --> 00:49:36,199
research projects going on and just

1011
00:49:32,809 --> 00:49:40,789
briefly because I know that in the

1012
00:49:36,199 --> 00:49:41,838
guidelines for for what we are supposed

1013
00:49:40,789 --> 00:49:45,108
to talk about

1014
00:49:41,838 --> 00:49:46,608
these adjunct appointments I just

1015
00:49:45,108 --> 00:49:50,210
thought I'd mention that I also do a lot

1016
00:49:46,608 --> 00:49:53,630
of outreach so I travel to career fairs

1017
00:49:50,210 --> 00:49:56,210
and I've given guest lectures in high

1018
00:49:53,630 --> 00:49:58,099
schools and like in truman's Brook high

1019
00:49:56,210 --> 00:50:00,228
school I have a friend who teaches

1020
00:49:58,099 --> 00:50:03,528
biology ap biology and so I've given

1021
00:50:00,228 --> 00:50:08,298
crop domestication lectures there we

1022
00:50:03,528 --> 00:50:11,210
helped with making DNA with kids and so

1023
00:50:08,298 --> 00:50:12,798
there's a lot of fun outreach things

1024
00:50:11,210 --> 00:50:14,960
that we get to do with this kind of type

1025
00:50:12,798 --> 00:50:16,969
of job too we go to Empire Farm days

1026
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:19,699
talk to the public about the kinds of

1027
00:50:16,969 --> 00:50:21,858
work that we do in Geneva and so on so

1028
00:50:19,699 --> 00:50:24,018
there are way way way too many collab

1029
00:50:21,858 --> 00:50:25,278
individual collaborators to mention so

1030
00:50:24,018 --> 00:50:28,548
instead what I'll do is I'll just

1031
00:50:25,278 --> 00:50:31,940
quickly mention the labs that I've

1032
00:50:28,548 --> 00:50:35,059
collaborated with in Geneva in the USDA

1033
00:50:31,940 --> 00:50:38,389
that's every other scientist in the unit

1034
00:50:35,059 --> 00:50:40,519
basically and some sadly are no longer

1035
00:50:38,389 --> 00:50:41,210
in the group but I've enjoyed working

1036
00:50:40,518 --> 00:50:43,998
with them

1037
00:50:41,210 --> 00:50:46,460
there are used USDA scientists elsewhere

1038
00:50:43,998 --> 00:50:49,009
that I have worked with and still work

1039
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:53,239
with there are Cornell scientists I've

1040
00:50:49,009 --> 00:50:55,278
published with and I'm happy if any of

1041
00:50:53,239 --> 00:50:57,499
you have any kind of idea for a project

1042
00:50:55,278 --> 00:50:59,599
that would relate to our germ plasm or

1043
00:50:57,498 --> 00:51:01,518
our grape tsiyon or disease resistance

1044
00:50:59,599 --> 00:51:02,960
work let me know or if you have a

1045
00:51:01,518 --> 00:51:04,419
student that you want help

1046
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:06,858
guiding because they have some

1047
00:51:04,420 --> 00:51:09,190
bioinformatic component let me know I'd

1048
00:51:06,858 --> 00:51:11,630
be happy to talk to you

1049
00:51:09,190 --> 00:51:14,900
there's also scientists elsewhere

1050
00:51:11,630 --> 00:51:19,309
there's Amy Ione Michael Malinois David

1051
00:51:14,900 --> 00:51:23,289
Francis sue Gardner Andrews pile marks

1052
00:51:19,309 --> 00:51:26,719
Alton ancien lon and finally there were

1053
00:51:23,289 --> 00:51:28,969
two RIT students that did masters theses

1054
00:51:26,719 --> 00:51:30,889
they came in as summer students liked

1055
00:51:28,969 --> 00:51:32,778
working with us so much that they

1056
00:51:30,889 --> 00:51:35,568
decided to stay and make their project

1057
00:51:32,778 --> 00:51:37,579
based on their their thesis project

1058
00:51:35,568 --> 00:51:39,318
based on what we worked on so that's it

1059
00:51:37,579 --> 00:51:42,609
thank you so much for your attention and

1060
00:51:39,318 --> 00:51:42,608
I'd love to answer questions

1061
00:51:44,619 --> 00:51:53,799
okay so the question was whether this

1062
00:51:49,659 --> 00:51:57,190
this dataset looked like it matched the

1063
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:59,740
gene flow and the the answer is that

1064
00:51:57,190 --> 00:52:02,829
except for these none of these are

1065
00:51:59,739 --> 00:52:04,869
developed lines these are Venice

1066
00:52:02,829 --> 00:52:08,199
vinifera ants and their wild relatives

1067
00:52:04,869 --> 00:52:12,429
and the rest of these are all basically

1068
00:52:08,199 --> 00:52:16,359
wild accessions and so nobody really

1069
00:52:12,429 --> 00:52:18,639
knows how grapes evolved the problem is

1070
00:52:16,360 --> 00:52:21,640
that there looks like there was one big

1071
00:52:18,639 --> 00:52:26,230
giant explosion of grapes all at once

1072
00:52:21,639 --> 00:52:27,730
and so that's part of the problem with

1073
00:52:26,230 --> 00:52:30,010
visualizing these data with a

1074
00:52:27,730 --> 00:52:33,340
phylogenetic tree is because what you

1075
00:52:30,010 --> 00:52:35,530
get is a big rush of everything off

1076
00:52:33,340 --> 00:52:37,539
splitting off almost at once the other

1077
00:52:35,530 --> 00:52:39,250
thing that's tricky is that almost all

1078
00:52:37,539 --> 00:52:41,590
of these freely in a breed with each

1079
00:52:39,250 --> 00:52:44,409
other so as soon as you move one

1080
00:52:41,590 --> 00:52:46,720
somewhere else they just start happily

1081
00:52:44,409 --> 00:52:49,629
interbreeding there's only one grape in

1082
00:52:46,719 --> 00:52:50,859
North America and that doesn't do that

1083
00:52:49,630 --> 00:52:54,820
because it has a slightly different

1084
00:52:50,860 --> 00:52:56,860
number of chromosomes and and even it

1085
00:52:54,820 --> 00:52:58,320
can be made to crossbreed and some

1086
00:52:56,860 --> 00:53:01,750
people think it doesn't even belong in

1087
00:52:58,320 --> 00:53:06,970
Vitus necessarily or they think it's

1088
00:53:01,750 --> 00:53:09,940
like a an out-group so so it does match

1089
00:53:06,969 --> 00:53:11,679
what we might expect but it's really

1090
00:53:09,940 --> 00:53:13,090
hard to know what to expect given that

1091
00:53:11,679 --> 00:53:17,139
none of the trees and none of the

1092
00:53:13,090 --> 00:53:23,340
history of grape as a species or a genus

1093
00:53:17,139 --> 00:53:23,339
is clear thanks Dave yeah

1094
00:53:23,909 --> 00:53:39,509
I don't know if they I'm not sure

1095
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:42,659
they've taken that data I think that

1096
00:53:39,510 --> 00:53:45,420
that project came from a snip data

1097
00:53:42,659 --> 00:53:47,578
project and remember I said that gb/s

1098
00:53:45,420 --> 00:53:50,159
was better than snip chips because

1099
00:53:47,579 --> 00:53:54,030
there's no ascertain 'men bias the

1100
00:53:50,159 --> 00:53:56,460
problem the reason snip chips are bad

1101
00:53:54,030 --> 00:54:01,380
for some organisms is because if you

1102
00:53:56,460 --> 00:54:04,470
have a highly outcrossing clonal crop so

1103
00:54:01,380 --> 00:54:06,960
this thing is not an annual and it's

1104
00:54:04,469 --> 00:54:10,108
highly out crossing you have so much

1105
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:12,179
hetero zygosity expected and so much

1106
00:54:10,108 --> 00:54:15,690
diversity that if you use chip

1107
00:54:12,179 --> 00:54:19,019
technology to assay a collection you're

1108
00:54:15,690 --> 00:54:21,539
going to miss all of the diversity that

1109
00:54:19,019 --> 00:54:25,980
wasn't in the original samples that were

1110
00:54:21,539 --> 00:54:28,950
used to design the chip and so even if

1111
00:54:25,980 --> 00:54:31,289
it I I can't really say because it was

1112
00:54:28,949 --> 00:54:33,989
not exactly the same codes collections

1113
00:54:31,289 --> 00:54:38,609
first of all and are the same samples

1114
00:54:33,989 --> 00:54:42,058
but even if it were its we were directly

1115
00:54:38,608 --> 00:54:44,038
sequencing with PCR so if we found a

1116
00:54:42,059 --> 00:54:46,980
verse if there was diversity we found it

1117
00:54:44,039 --> 00:54:51,059
and they were they used a different

1118
00:54:46,980 --> 00:54:52,019
technology and so I'm not sure that what

1119
00:54:51,059 --> 00:54:54,298
they found would have been

1120
00:54:52,019 --> 00:54:55,889
representative but then on the other

1121
00:54:54,298 --> 00:54:59,538
hand they were surveying more of the

1122
00:54:55,889 --> 00:55:02,219
genome whereas we are only surveying 30

1123
00:54:59,539 --> 00:55:05,339
so it's hard to it's hard to compare

1124
00:55:02,219 --> 00:55:07,439
those but but as far as the conventional

1125
00:55:05,338 --> 00:55:09,088
understanding of how grapes evolved in

1126
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:13,920
general I would say this is pretty

1127
00:55:09,088 --> 00:55:17,389
accurate maybe we didn't expect to

1128
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:19,798
separate lumps of North Americans I

1129
00:55:17,389 --> 00:55:23,250
think that might have been unexpected

1130
00:55:19,798 --> 00:55:25,650
and definitely as far as identifying

1131
00:55:23,250 --> 00:55:27,929
hybrids and mislabeled accessions this

1132
00:55:25,650 --> 00:55:30,559
works too this corroborate that sort of

1133
00:55:27,929 --> 00:55:30,558
thing yeah

1134
00:55:34,389 --> 00:55:44,129
yeah go ahead Oh for the powdery mildew

1135
00:55:41,769 --> 00:55:44,130
sure

1136
00:55:44,219 --> 00:55:57,099
oops yes we did try to do that but the

1137
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:58,809
computers we had access to were not

1138
00:55:57,099 --> 00:56:01,389
powerful enough and this guy needed to

1139
00:55:58,809 --> 00:56:03,820
get out he was only working on a

1140
00:56:01,389 --> 00:56:06,819
master's so we only had him for a year

1141
00:56:03,820 --> 00:56:08,260
we couldn't keep it stuck keep nope nope

1142
00:56:06,820 --> 00:56:12,190
sorry you have to stay here for three

1143
00:56:08,260 --> 00:56:14,380
more years so if if we had had access to

1144
00:56:12,190 --> 00:56:16,179
more powerful computers and more time I

1145
00:56:14,380 --> 00:56:19,269
think a hybrid assembly would have

1146
00:56:16,179 --> 00:56:21,609
worked but unfortunately it didn't

1147
00:56:19,269 --> 00:56:28,960
because of Technology thanks for the

1148
00:56:21,610 --> 00:56:31,720
question yes we have an estimate and I

1149
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:32,829
cannot remember what the number is but I

1150
00:56:31,719 --> 00:56:33,309
can look it up for you if you're

1151
00:56:32,829 --> 00:56:37,170
interested

1152
00:56:33,309 --> 00:56:40,329
I believe it's pre-human

1153
00:56:37,170 --> 00:56:41,889
it's probably pre-human but you know

1154
00:56:40,329 --> 00:56:46,799
what I will look it up and I will get

1155
00:56:41,889 --> 00:56:46,799
back to you on that yes

1156
00:56:49,289 --> 00:56:52,289
yes

1157
00:56:52,659 --> 00:57:07,509
the North American and Asian oops sorry

1158
00:56:56,820 --> 00:57:09,400
wrong way okay they aren't as distinct

1159
00:57:07,510 --> 00:57:11,410
as they look because if you rotate this

1160
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:16,150
thing you'll see that these fall in the

1161
00:57:11,409 --> 00:57:18,069
same plane and if you're interested I

1162
00:57:16,150 --> 00:57:20,230
can show you a rotated version of this

1163
00:57:18,070 --> 00:57:22,120
sometime it's really fun you just take

1164
00:57:20,230 --> 00:57:25,869
your mouse and you grab it and you can

1165
00:57:22,119 --> 00:57:27,670
like rotate the whole thing around which

1166
00:57:25,869 --> 00:57:30,069
makes it a lot easier to see but harder

1167
00:57:27,670 --> 00:57:32,079
to Polycom so I went with a still slide

1168
00:57:30,070 --> 00:57:34,510
for this but yeah it's sort of like

1169
00:57:32,079 --> 00:57:38,230
these are in one plane and then these

1170
00:57:34,510 --> 00:57:40,900
make another sort of when you when you

1171
00:57:38,230 --> 00:57:43,440
rotate it it sort of looks like this if

1172
00:57:40,900 --> 00:57:43,440
that's

1173
00:57:48,670 --> 00:57:57,119
this has been a production of Cornell
