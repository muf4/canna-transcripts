1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:05,870
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,238 --> 00:00:07,668
University okay so thank you for having

3
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:10,009
me I haven't spoken to this seminar

4
00:00:07,668 --> 00:00:14,480
series before so it's really nice to be

5
00:00:10,009 --> 00:00:18,800
here faces and introduce you to our

6
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:22,730
program so today I want to cover quite a

7
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:24,710
large number of things so that's gonna

8
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:27,679
give me the high five if I'm going too

9
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:31,250
long but I want to set the stage in case

10
00:00:27,678 --> 00:00:33,979
you're not familiar with global data on

11
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:36,530
where we are with climate change and how

12
00:00:33,979 --> 00:00:39,049
that affects agriculture and then I want

13
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:41,420
to introduce you to the work we've been

14
00:00:39,049 --> 00:00:44,949
doing since 2015 with the climate smart

15
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:47,870
farming program and that includes

16
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:50,690
stakeholder research and engagement so I

17
00:00:47,869 --> 00:00:52,539
am trained as a social scientist my PhD

18
00:00:50,689 --> 00:00:55,219
is in global environmental politics

19
00:00:52,539 --> 00:00:58,429
which you could ask me how I got to this

20
00:00:55,219 --> 00:01:00,320
position it was a long circuitous route

21
00:00:58,429 --> 00:01:04,010
but I'm really happy to be here I love

22
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:05,599
working with farmers and agriculture at

23
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:08,359
the intersection of agriculture and

24
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:11,299
environment um then I'll talk about our

25
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:13,069
resources I'll introduce you to the

26
00:01:11,299 --> 00:01:15,979
decision tools that we have developed

27
00:01:13,069 --> 00:01:20,359
and talked about the outreach that we do

28
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:22,340
and then I want to take this to sort of

29
00:01:20,359 --> 00:01:25,310
connect it to the work that johannes and

30
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:29,240
I do by talking about what we do at the

31
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:31,480
cup and how climate smart agriculture is

32
00:01:29,239 --> 00:01:34,339
a term that's really gaining traction

33
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:37,550
globally it's critically important that

34
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:40,159
Cornell stay involved with this and I

35
00:01:37,549 --> 00:01:42,259
also want to acknowledge that I'm part

36
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:44,540
of a team you'll see the team up here so

37
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:47,330
this work I'm presenting it but it's

38
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:48,920
really that I helped facilitate a lot of

39
00:01:47,329 --> 00:01:52,340
the work that goes on at Cornell and

40
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:55,849
this is not just my output it's a whole

41
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:58,909
team so Brian Belcher is one of our

42
00:01:55,849 --> 00:02:01,209
programmers an amazing computer

43
00:01:58,909 --> 00:02:03,350
programmer with a master's degree in

44
00:02:01,209 --> 00:02:05,269
atmospheric science and he was going to

45
00:02:03,349 --> 00:02:09,769
be here today to help talk about the

46
00:02:05,269 --> 00:02:12,949
tools but he is sick so so to give you a

47
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:14,080
little bit of background this if you

48
00:02:12,949 --> 00:02:16,879
haven't seen the

49
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:23,239
data this is the global temperature

50
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:28,189
change data showing here global change

51
00:02:23,239 --> 00:02:31,489
in Fahrenheit from before 1900 up past

52
00:02:28,189 --> 00:02:34,909
2000 and if you saw the New York Times

53
00:02:31,489 --> 00:02:38,239
article recently last year was one of

54
00:02:34,909 --> 00:02:40,909
the warmest years on record our earth's

55
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:44,239
temperature globally in 2018 was more

56
00:02:40,909 --> 00:02:46,579
than 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit warmer or

57
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:50,930
above average temperature of the

58
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:53,569
previous since the 19th century and so

59
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:55,219
we also we talked about in terms of

60
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:58,869
climate change because it's not only

61
00:02:55,219 --> 00:03:01,519
temperature change but impacts like

62
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:04,099
increasing severity of drought so this

63
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:06,080
shows data of the change in the drought

64
00:03:04,098 --> 00:03:10,238
severity index the Palmer drought

65
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:13,280
severity index from 1900 to 20 2002

66
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:16,730
areas of the globe that are more dry are

67
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:19,189
getting drier and projections are that

68
00:03:16,729 --> 00:03:24,649
that will be the trend so we in the

69
00:03:19,189 --> 00:03:27,590
Northeast are actually very fortunate um

70
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:29,719
this is one of the things that when I go

71
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:32,329
out and do very frequent talks with

72
00:03:29,719 --> 00:03:34,519
agriculture groups farmers this is the

73
00:03:32,329 --> 00:03:37,129
thing that they are noticing the most

74
00:03:34,519 --> 00:03:38,719
and that I talk about in terms of they

75
00:03:37,129 --> 00:03:41,389
often don't make the connection that

76
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:44,239
this is related to changing climate so

77
00:03:41,389 --> 00:03:47,449
we see an observed trend in these very

78
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:50,870
very heavy rainfall events from 1950 to

79
00:03:47,449 --> 00:03:52,849
2000 to 2012 this is happening all over

80
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:54,980
the United States but the most

81
00:03:52,849 --> 00:03:57,370
pronounced effect is in the northeastern

82
00:03:54,979 --> 00:04:00,280
US where we're getting these very heavy

83
00:03:57,370 --> 00:04:05,140
downpours and then

84
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:06,939
shows you data from the last National

85
00:04:05,139 --> 00:04:08,829
Climate Assessment that shows that in

86
00:04:06,939 --> 00:04:12,609
the Northeast we're seeing this

87
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:16,359
frost-free season length lengthening by

88
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:19,600
10 days so these changes all affect

89
00:04:16,358 --> 00:04:24,969
farmers and where we are projected to go

90
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:27,070
this projections of climate depend on

91
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:28,840
the emissions that we all emit globally

92
00:04:27,069 --> 00:04:30,939
and so this is just a middle emission

93
00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:34,209
scenario there is a high emission

94
00:04:30,939 --> 00:04:36,910
scenario and a very very efficient low

95
00:04:34,209 --> 00:04:39,789
emission scenario even with a high

96
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:43,439
emission scenario or a middle emission

97
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:46,860
scenario we are going to be warming on

98
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:49,990
average we are expected to increase by 2

99
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:51,910
to 13 degrees Fahrenheit by the end of

100
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:57,519
the century depending on what we as

101
00:04:51,910 --> 00:05:00,160
humans do and so this is in really one

102
00:04:57,519 --> 00:05:03,629
of the most critical issues globally

103
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:06,970
that we face and especially for farmers

104
00:05:03,629 --> 00:05:09,009
so agriculture you can think about it

105
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:11,680
that it's really one of the most unique

106
00:05:09,009 --> 00:05:15,069
sectors and one of the most challenging

107
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:17,709
to address and that's why when I talk

108
00:05:15,069 --> 00:05:20,620
about global policy it's been very hard

109
00:05:17,709 --> 00:05:22,180
to address agriculture within the United

110
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:24,728
Nations Framework Convention because

111
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:27,069
it's so challenging because it's it's an

112
00:05:24,728 --> 00:05:30,728
economic sector farmers need to be

113
00:05:27,069 --> 00:05:33,699
profitable but they are also globally

114
00:05:30,728 --> 00:05:35,969
one of the largest oops one of the

115
00:05:33,699 --> 00:05:39,189
largest shoots

116
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:44,080
producers of greenhouse gas emissions so

117
00:05:39,189 --> 00:05:46,300
this is local data from the IPCC that

118
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:48,310
agriculture forestry and land use

119
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:51,400
represents 24 percent of global

120
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:53,610
greenhouse gas emissions but at the same

121
00:05:51,399 --> 00:05:58,509
time they are one of the most vulnerable

122
00:05:53,610 --> 00:06:01,660
sectors that is really impacted by

123
00:05:58,509 --> 00:06:05,289
climate change so this is a brand new

124
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:07,570
FAO report from 2018 that shows the

125
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:10,150
increase in these annual economic

126
00:06:07,569 --> 00:06:12,879
damages to agriculture from

127
00:06:10,149 --> 00:06:13,939
climate-related disasters we know that

128
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:16,490
one disaster

129
00:06:13,939 --> 00:06:18,709
or one weather event is not climate

130
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:21,050
change but we know that these extreme

131
00:06:18,709 --> 00:06:21,560
events are increasing with climate

132
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:25,430
change

133
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:27,610
so from 14 billion in the last decade

134
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:32,900
we've gone to a hundred billion dollars

135
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:35,420
annually and if another way of thinking

136
00:06:32,899 --> 00:06:37,879
about this is in our own region we have

137
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:41,230
we know farmers are experiencing

138
00:06:37,879 --> 00:06:43,370
challenges and are expected to increase

139
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:46,400
experience these challenges in the

140
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:48,620
future including the increase in extreme

141
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:51,589
weather events flooding and then

142
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:54,620
short-term droughts on the other extreme

143
00:06:51,589 --> 00:06:58,939
high temperature stress few pests and

144
00:06:54,620 --> 00:07:01,189
diseases but of all you saw that picture

145
00:06:58,939 --> 00:07:04,550
of the globe of where it's going to get

146
00:07:01,189 --> 00:07:08,029
more dry and if we think about dr. Toby

147
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:11,629
alts work looking at projections for

148
00:07:08,029 --> 00:07:14,509
very long term droughts in the

149
00:07:11,629 --> 00:07:15,860
southeastern United States then if we

150
00:07:14,509 --> 00:07:17,870
think about where we are in the

151
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:20,389
Northeast we have opportunities

152
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:25,519
potentially if we manage our water

153
00:07:20,389 --> 00:07:27,680
resources well we're also closely linked

154
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:30,168
to 22 percent of the population and

155
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:34,790
markets in in New York and the Northeast

156
00:07:30,168 --> 00:07:38,379
so we could be producing more products

157
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:42,530
to make up for losses in other areas and

158
00:07:38,379 --> 00:07:45,168
so this is the latest National Climate

159
00:07:42,529 --> 00:07:46,899
Assessment that just came out even in

160
00:07:45,168 --> 00:07:51,109
the Trump administration this came out

161
00:07:46,899 --> 00:07:53,299
talking about the effects on agriculture

162
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:57,680
and I I won't read it but you can go and

163
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:58,579
find the link there so with that as a

164
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,709
background

165
00:07:58,579 --> 00:08:04,668
the Cornell Institute for climate smart

166
00:08:00,709 --> 00:08:06,918
solutions was formed in 2013 really to

167
00:08:04,668 --> 00:08:09,918
focus on agriculture we did change our

168
00:08:06,918 --> 00:08:14,990
name to be able to work on communities

169
00:08:09,918 --> 00:08:18,019
very related to agriculture and we are

170
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:20,600
based we're working on facilitating

171
00:08:18,019 --> 00:08:23,779
research helping pull together large

172
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:27,689
grant proposals that get submitted to

173
00:08:23,779 --> 00:08:30,899
USDA or NSF and there's a really huge

174
00:08:27,689 --> 00:08:32,519
capacity here at Cornell when we think

175
00:08:30,899 --> 00:08:34,590
about it there are more than a hundred

176
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:36,329
and fifty researchers at Cornell working

177
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:38,759
on some aspects related to climate

178
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:42,360
change so all of all the global

179
00:08:38,759 --> 00:08:44,279
universities I think we are one of the

180
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:48,279
strongest in this area and we should

181
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:51,399
seize this strength

182
00:08:48,279 --> 00:08:55,269
so this is our core team here we sit

183
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:59,110
over in Rice Hall our faculty advisors

184
00:08:55,269 --> 00:09:00,939
are here we have three postdocs one

185
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:05,500
Danielle is full-time with us and then

186
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:07,900
Carlos and Demetri sit mostly in E is

187
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:09,700
and work with Toby but they work on

188
00:09:07,899 --> 00:09:13,329
tools that are on the climate start

189
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:15,250
farming website and then quite uniquely

190
00:09:13,330 --> 00:09:16,629
I was on the phone with our extension

191
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:19,870
team this morning these are an

192
00:09:16,629 --> 00:09:22,480
incredible resource for New York State

193
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:24,639
we have the only climate smart farming

194
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:26,769
team in the country and these are folks

195
00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:30,580
that are out working in the region's

196
00:09:26,769 --> 00:09:33,220
kitty has a PhD Elizabeth is brand new

197
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:35,170
to the team an amazing resource and they

198
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:37,570
can really connect us to what's

199
00:09:35,169 --> 00:09:39,909
happening on the farms and what farmers

200
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:41,860
think and are they going to be using

201
00:09:39,909 --> 00:09:44,620
these tools or what's the most important

202
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:46,240
tool that we could develop and I'll talk

203
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:51,100
about some of the resources we've worked

204
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:52,839
on with them so I mention at the

205
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:55,509
beginning that I am a social scientist

206
00:09:52,839 --> 00:09:58,900
and so part of the research that I do

207
00:09:55,509 --> 00:10:01,689
with others here to contribute to the

208
00:09:58,899 --> 00:10:04,779
climate smart farming program is to take

209
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:07,350
a look at what stakeholders in this case

210
00:10:04,779 --> 00:10:10,209
farmers or extension or consultants

211
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:12,370
think about climate change what are they

212
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:14,430
doing to adapt what are they doing to

213
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:17,649
mitigate what are the barriers that they

214
00:10:14,429 --> 00:10:19,959
experience and we know that a

215
00:10:17,649 --> 00:10:22,588
stakeholder is defined as any citizen or

216
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:26,500
group partially potentially affected by

217
00:10:22,589 --> 00:10:28,300
or having a vested interest and so I

218
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:30,460
think this is really critically

219
00:10:28,299 --> 00:10:32,799
important I love working at Cornell

220
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:35,920
because we have the capacity to work

221
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:38,649
with interdisciplinary teams probably

222
00:10:35,919 --> 00:10:40,569
more than any other University when I

223
00:10:38,649 --> 00:10:42,879
talked to my colleagues at American

224
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:44,860
University and they and they understand

225
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:47,470
what we can do here that I get to work

226
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:50,019
with Matt on a proposal or call him up

227
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:52,450
and ask him for input but I can work on

228
00:10:50,019 --> 00:10:55,629
the social science it's really really

229
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:58,540
powerful and it's critically important

230
00:10:55,629 --> 00:11:01,870
because if if we're just developing fact

231
00:10:58,539 --> 00:11:05,079
sheets and tools but we don't

232
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:08,139
no if farmers even want them or what

233
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:09,850
their level of computer usage is or are

234
00:11:08,139 --> 00:11:11,980
they going to use them they're not

235
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:15,278
likely to use them and I have some data

236
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:18,730
a little bit depressing data that shows

237
00:11:15,278 --> 00:11:22,450
that quite well so the things that the

238
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:24,639
idea here is that we would be doing we

239
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:27,430
are doing cutting-edge climate change

240
00:11:24,639 --> 00:11:29,620
research here at Cornell we are

241
00:11:27,429 --> 00:11:32,229
developing decision tools for a long

242
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:34,028
time starting and work in this

243
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:37,300
department with adapt gun and other

244
00:11:34,028 --> 00:11:40,120
tools we do have very strong abstention

245
00:11:37,299 --> 00:11:42,009
programming and so we can engage farmers

246
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:45,549
and understand what they are looking for

247
00:11:42,009 --> 00:11:48,220
and then improve research and the

248
00:11:45,549 --> 00:11:50,740
extension that we're doing so some of

249
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:53,170
the social science research that we've

250
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:55,480
been involved with we did a

251
00:11:53,169 --> 00:11:56,889
meta-analysis that looked at all the

252
00:11:55,480 --> 00:12:00,310
literature on climate change in

253
00:11:56,889 --> 00:12:03,370
agriculture from 1997 to 2016 and

254
00:12:00,309 --> 00:12:05,709
published that in this article in Weyers

255
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:07,560
climate change we've conducted focus

256
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:10,509
groups in New York and Pennsylvania

257
00:12:07,559 --> 00:12:12,278
that's been published and then we are

258
00:12:10,509 --> 00:12:15,750
working on a publication that looks at

259
00:12:12,278 --> 00:12:17,860
dairy producers views and actions in

260
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:20,470
Wisconsin in New York that was part of

261
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:23,230
the dairy cap project um and then we've

262
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:25,450
started to do some work in surveys now

263
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:28,539
that we have really some in-depth

264
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:31,450
knowledge we can do more broad scale

265
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:34,059
surveys so we've done a convenient

266
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:37,930
sample survey at Empire Farm days over

267
00:12:34,059 --> 00:12:41,679
two years we've done an online random

268
00:12:37,929 --> 00:12:44,019
sample survey of New York farmers we did

269
00:12:41,679 --> 00:12:46,838
not get a great response rate because it

270
00:12:44,019 --> 00:12:48,909
was a an electronic survey so if you

271
00:12:46,839 --> 00:12:50,440
think about 32,000 farmers in New York

272
00:12:48,909 --> 00:12:53,730
State we did not get a good response

273
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:56,620
rate so we and that's in part because

274
00:12:53,730 --> 00:13:00,209
farmers are less likely to fill out an

275
00:12:56,620 --> 00:13:03,399
electronic survey so we're planning to

276
00:13:00,208 --> 00:13:05,319
revise the survey and do a mailed survey

277
00:13:03,399 --> 00:13:07,208
it's much more expensive to do it that

278
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:10,209
way but we're going to hire a company to

279
00:13:07,208 --> 00:13:13,059
help with that and then as an example we

280
00:13:10,208 --> 00:13:15,199
can do farm visits and with an intern

281
00:13:13,059 --> 00:13:17,379
that we had a Cooperative Extension

282
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:20,480
pharming intern I'm an awesome

283
00:13:17,379 --> 00:13:22,549
undergraduate Tyler Brewer went out and

284
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:25,190
he worked in Madison County all last

285
00:13:22,549 --> 00:13:27,829
summer with Sarah ficken and they went

286
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:29,690
out to over 30 farms and talked about

287
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:31,850
the impacts that farmers are

288
00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:36,890
experiencing and what are the adaptation

289
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:40,120
practices they are working on so just

290
00:13:36,889 --> 00:13:43,100
some general too much text on this side

291
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:45,830
but some general findings from our

292
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:47,750
social science aspects are that the key

293
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:50,270
impacts in the Northeast are things that

294
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:52,549
we would expect more farmers are

295
00:13:50,269 --> 00:13:55,100
noticing more extreme weather flooding

296
00:13:52,549 --> 00:14:00,289
are the two things they talk about most

297
00:13:55,100 --> 00:14:02,509
changes in seasons and pests and we know

298
00:14:00,289 --> 00:14:04,789
that the majority of farmers believe the

299
00:14:02,509 --> 00:14:08,870
climate is changing so even today

300
00:14:04,789 --> 00:14:10,789
talking to our extension team they know

301
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:12,950
that their colleagues are reluctant to

302
00:14:10,789 --> 00:14:15,799
talk up to farmers about this issue but

303
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:19,070
we know that farmers agree the climate

304
00:14:15,799 --> 00:14:19,579
is changing so I keep trying to talk to

305
00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:22,129
you

306
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:23,900
our extension team and Extension say

307
00:14:22,129 --> 00:14:26,330
don't be afraid to address this issue

308
00:14:23,899 --> 00:14:28,100
talk about it in terms of increased

309
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:30,980
flooding or talked about it in terms of

310
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:34,279
resiliency or energy savings through

311
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:36,139
mitigation because they know that your

312
00:14:34,279 --> 00:14:41,240
climate is changing don't shy away from

313
00:14:36,139 --> 00:14:43,220
this science-based topic all day and

314
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:45,620
then from the focus groups we know that

315
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:47,720
although farmers are concerned about

316
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:49,940
climate impacts especially in New York

317
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:53,149
State when we've done the focus groups

318
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:55,940
they are also much more concerned about

319
00:14:53,149 --> 00:14:57,949
these other issues and so what we see is

320
00:14:55,940 --> 00:15:00,320
that climate change just adds one more

321
00:14:57,950 --> 00:15:02,270
layer of stress if you think about the

322
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:04,310
dairy industry and profitability right

323
00:15:02,269 --> 00:15:07,429
now climate change is not their type

324
00:15:04,309 --> 00:15:09,919
priority but when they get hit by a five

325
00:15:07,429 --> 00:15:10,489
inch rainfall event then yeah they are

326
00:15:09,919 --> 00:15:13,279
suffering

327
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:15,320
more than they would have been so if we

328
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:17,389
can talk to them about adaptation

329
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:20,629
practices that they're already doing or

330
00:15:17,389 --> 00:15:25,590
they could do slowly over time that's a

331
00:15:20,629 --> 00:15:28,110
good way of framing it and just

332
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:32,550
very recent findings from our pilot

333
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:34,200
surveys in terms of climate change 68%

334
00:15:32,549 --> 00:15:35,519
of the farmers that responded we're

335
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:40,110
concerned are very concerned about

336
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:44,250
drought and about increases in extreme

337
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:45,779
precipitation 64% of the adaptation

338
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:49,169
practices that they said they are

339
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:52,919
adopting many are using diversified

340
00:15:49,169 --> 00:15:57,120
rotation soil health less so reduced

341
00:15:52,919 --> 00:16:01,019
tillage and when we asked about tools or

342
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:03,450
weather forecasts most farmers 63% do

343
00:16:01,019 --> 00:16:05,399
not use any apps or smartphones or

344
00:16:03,450 --> 00:16:07,800
mobile devices to inform their

345
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:11,009
management decisions so that's pretty

346
00:16:07,799 --> 00:16:12,990
depressing when we asked about the

347
00:16:11,009 --> 00:16:15,480
specific online weather and climate

348
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:20,610
resources they are using the Farmers

349
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:24,810
Almanac which is not that accurate so we

350
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:28,230
have a lot of work to do to get farmers

351
00:16:24,809 --> 00:16:33,869
to really understand these tools and

352
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:36,450
understand how they are helpful so with

353
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:39,539
that I'll introduce you to the program

354
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:41,879
and I have materials in the back some

355
00:16:39,539 --> 00:16:44,219
fact sheets and business cards you could

356
00:16:41,879 --> 00:16:46,830
take a bunch and hand them out if you

357
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:52,980
work with farmers so really we're

358
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:55,080
providing of one place for resources we

359
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:57,029
have some videos of farmers talking

360
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:59,610
about what they have experienced we have

361
00:16:57,029 --> 00:17:04,649
links to our extension team and the site

362
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:08,459
actually got above 3000 web web hits a

363
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:12,420
month recently so we see that the usage

364
00:17:08,459 --> 00:17:14,910
is climbing which is great so there's an

365
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:19,259
example of a video that we captured with

366
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:21,570
the help of undergrads is this local

367
00:17:19,259 --> 00:17:25,049
farmer maybe you know him Toro Schnur

368
00:17:21,569 --> 00:17:27,089
and he says in the video a normal season

369
00:17:25,049 --> 00:17:30,990
doesn't seem like it happens anymore

370
00:17:27,089 --> 00:17:33,629
it's either really dry or really wet we

371
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:36,480
got five inches of rain in an hour and a

372
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:39,060
half and I had a lot of soil loss and he

373
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:41,970
was almost in tears at this point

374
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:44,730
it was like apocalyptic so please check

375
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:46,529
out this video and others not all the

376
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:48,990
farmers that we talked to would agree

377
00:17:46,529 --> 00:17:51,180
that there taking the actions that they

378
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:52,950
are because of climate change some of

379
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:56,730
the apple farmers in western New York

380
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:58,559
are there's a net zero farm and he did

381
00:17:56,730 --> 00:18:00,660
not do that for climate change he did

382
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:05,099
that because he wanted to have control

383
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:06,779
over his energy costs um so I would say

384
00:18:05,099 --> 00:18:09,119
maybe that doesn't matter

385
00:18:06,779 --> 00:18:12,440
he's a NetZero farm and we should share

386
00:18:09,119 --> 00:18:14,279
his story and get other farmers to

387
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:18,450
understand that they can do the same

388
00:18:14,279 --> 00:18:23,579
thing so this is our extension team

389
00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:26,130
again and the idea here is that very we

390
00:18:23,579 --> 00:18:28,559
don't have the funds nor would these

391
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:31,680
experts have the time to work on climate

392
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:33,960
change solely for 100% of their job and

393
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:35,789
I actually think it's more important

394
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:38,549
that they incorporate this into the work

395
00:18:35,789 --> 00:18:40,440
that they're doing so kiddi just told me

396
00:18:38,549 --> 00:18:43,079
on the call that she did two talks last

397
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:45,090
week that explained the cover crop tool

398
00:18:43,079 --> 00:18:49,349
and the growing degree day tool so

399
00:18:45,089 --> 00:18:51,269
they're incorporating what their climate

400
00:18:49,349 --> 00:18:54,929
and the resources and tools into their

401
00:18:51,269 --> 00:18:58,859
work with farmers and so these are the

402
00:18:54,930 --> 00:19:01,410
resources our undergrad is working on

403
00:18:58,859 --> 00:19:05,699
getting new fact sheets from Peter wood

404
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:07,769
buried up here on mitigation and there

405
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:09,990
are a lot of things up there so I'm

406
00:19:07,769 --> 00:19:11,670
assuming you all have a good

407
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:13,410
understanding of this I'm not going to

408
00:19:11,670 --> 00:19:15,180
explain this this would be something

409
00:19:13,410 --> 00:19:18,090
that I would talk about with farmer

410
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:20,160
audiences but when we do we need to

411
00:19:18,089 --> 00:19:23,699
think about mitigation which is reducing

412
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:28,460
emissions and adaptation for a long time

413
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:28,460
in climate science in policy world

414
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:32,880
policymakers didn't want to go to work

415
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:37,259
on adaptation because it would be like

416
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:38,850
admitting defeat and if we start working

417
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:40,670
on adaptation we're not going to reduce

418
00:19:38,849 --> 00:19:44,009
emissions I think there's a definite

419
00:19:40,670 --> 00:19:48,330
change where as we know even if we

420
00:19:44,009 --> 00:19:51,750
mitigate we're going to have to adapt so

421
00:19:48,329 --> 00:19:52,769
Peter is the expert in the room on much

422
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:56,490
more than I

423
00:19:52,769 --> 00:19:59,240
on these things and there are tools on

424
00:19:56,490 --> 00:20:02,339
the website that we are linking to and

425
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:05,069
much more it could be done at Cornell to

426
00:20:02,339 --> 00:20:07,558
find out if farmers are actually using

427
00:20:05,069 --> 00:20:09,359
these tools to what extent are they

428
00:20:07,558 --> 00:20:13,619
doing greenhouse gas audits on their

429
00:20:09,359 --> 00:20:18,599
farm but we don't have the resources to

430
00:20:13,619 --> 00:20:22,019
do that yet the other term as I

431
00:20:18,599 --> 00:20:24,538
mentioned is adaptation and there are a

432
00:20:22,019 --> 00:20:27,538
lot of examples of some great resources

433
00:20:24,538 --> 00:20:30,000
out there one of which came from the

434
00:20:27,538 --> 00:20:33,000
USDA climate hubs and it's this

435
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:37,259
adaptation resources book workbook

436
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:39,839
that's now online if you look at it it's

437
00:20:37,259 --> 00:20:43,619
pretty straightforward it's identifying

438
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:45,898
a process that farmers can use to look

439
00:20:43,619 --> 00:20:48,778
at what hap what's happening on their

440
00:20:45,898 --> 00:20:51,089
farms specifically and then evaluate the

441
00:20:48,778 --> 00:20:53,909
different management options they have

442
00:20:51,089 --> 00:20:57,898
and then adaptation approaches and then

443
00:20:53,909 --> 00:21:01,200
monitor and monitor and review if

444
00:20:57,898 --> 00:21:03,509
they're making changes so an example of

445
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:07,580
that these are the key strategies that

446
00:21:03,509 --> 00:21:10,048
that adaptation resource is highlighting

447
00:21:07,579 --> 00:21:12,439
sustaining fundamental functions of soil

448
00:21:10,048 --> 00:21:15,599
and water so protecting water quality

449
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:17,880
improving soil health and then all the

450
00:21:15,599 --> 00:21:20,459
way down to looking at infrastructure

451
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:22,470
what we found we actually did an online

452
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:26,819
climate smart farming course and had

453
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:28,860
some farmers use this workbook and it's

454
00:21:26,819 --> 00:21:32,819
not that easy to use and it's pretty

455
00:21:28,859 --> 00:21:36,538
complicated it's 100 pages long and so

456
00:21:32,819 --> 00:21:38,849
our team thought that it would be much

457
00:21:36,538 --> 00:21:43,548
more useful there wasn't a resource like

458
00:21:38,849 --> 00:21:46,048
this that's a short very factual

459
00:21:43,548 --> 00:21:48,240
assessed short assessment of what are

460
00:21:46,048 --> 00:21:50,849
the six key things that you may already

461
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:53,909
be doing as a farmer but that will help

462
00:21:50,849 --> 00:21:56,089
you increase resiliency and so this is

463
00:21:53,909 --> 00:21:58,500
one of the sheets I have in the back our

464
00:21:56,089 --> 00:22:00,509
team worked on this it took us longer

465
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:04,710
than we thought because we didn't want

466
00:22:00,509 --> 00:22:06,148
the language to be vague we wanted it to

467
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:08,129
be really specific

468
00:22:06,148 --> 00:22:13,528
to what farmers could actually do and

469
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:15,658
that helped we do this so I want to turn

470
00:22:13,528 --> 00:22:20,459
now to the decision tools that are on

471
00:22:15,659 --> 00:22:22,829
our website and we are really fortunate

472
00:22:20,459 --> 00:22:25,558
at Cornell to have the Northeast

473
00:22:22,828 --> 00:22:28,888
Regional Climate Center here on the 11th

474
00:22:25,558 --> 00:22:32,219
floor that's led by dr. art de Gaetano

475
00:22:28,888 --> 00:22:34,048
and they maintain all of the climate

476
00:22:32,219 --> 00:22:37,219
data for the northeastern United States

477
00:22:34,048 --> 00:22:39,719
for NOAA and their the purpose of the in

478
00:22:37,219 --> 00:22:42,088
center there's a center in different

479
00:22:39,719 --> 00:22:45,058
regions this is the Northeast region is

480
00:22:42,088 --> 00:22:47,519
to make climate data available for

481
00:22:45,058 --> 00:22:51,118
stakeholders to use the data and

482
00:22:47,519 --> 00:22:55,138
understand the climate and how climate

483
00:22:51,118 --> 00:22:59,718
is changing and so by working with NRCC

484
00:22:55,138 --> 00:23:02,968
we've worked to make some very specific

485
00:22:59,719 --> 00:23:05,519
web-based decision tools that can be

486
00:23:02,969 --> 00:23:08,028
used anywhere in the northeastern United

487
00:23:05,519 --> 00:23:12,118
States from Maine down to West Virginia

488
00:23:08,028 --> 00:23:16,919
for free any one of you if you live in

489
00:23:12,118 --> 00:23:19,138
Ithaca you can enter your address and on

490
00:23:16,919 --> 00:23:22,589
the left hand side of the tool is where

491
00:23:19,138 --> 00:23:25,678
you enter your user information there's

492
00:23:22,588 --> 00:23:27,928
some user inputs on the on the water

493
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:31,169
tool you enter what kind of soil you

494
00:23:27,929 --> 00:23:33,089
have what type of crop you're growing

495
00:23:31,169 --> 00:23:36,299
and then you get some pretty specific

496
00:23:33,088 --> 00:23:40,348
information about where you are in the

497
00:23:36,298 --> 00:23:42,808
season based on the different tool so

498
00:23:40,348 --> 00:23:45,448
the amazing thing about these tools

499
00:23:42,808 --> 00:23:50,519
there is a complimentary system called

500
00:23:45,449 --> 00:23:53,788
NOAA which is based on whether small

501
00:23:50,519 --> 00:23:55,618
weather stations and data from these

502
00:23:53,788 --> 00:23:57,298
small stations that farmers have

503
00:23:55,618 --> 00:23:59,368
purchased and put on their farm

504
00:23:57,298 --> 00:24:01,048
they cost about a thousand dollars and

505
00:23:59,368 --> 00:24:01,499
there's a not a large network of them

506
00:24:01,048 --> 00:24:03,538
now

507
00:24:01,499 --> 00:24:05,578
but if you're not near one of those

508
00:24:03,538 --> 00:24:07,919
stations you're kind of out of luck in

509
00:24:05,578 --> 00:24:12,868
using their tools and so this is a

510
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:14,999
really nice complementary system so this

511
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:17,668
shows you the tools that we have its

512
00:24:14,999 --> 00:24:19,950
climate smart farming org and the first

513
00:24:17,669 --> 00:24:22,040
tool is a really

514
00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:25,830
powerful growing degree day calculator

515
00:24:22,039 --> 00:24:28,319
the way that we talk about the fact that

516
00:24:25,829 --> 00:24:31,319
this one is different from many others

517
00:24:28,319 --> 00:24:33,659
out there is that it's using its

518
00:24:31,319 --> 00:24:36,899
updating on a daily basis of data

519
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:39,750
whereas many if you looked in a a group

520
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:41,130
or above 50 years ago and looked at the

521
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:44,450
charts for growing degree day

522
00:24:41,130 --> 00:24:46,560
calculations it was using a static

523
00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:48,509
calculation and it might have been

524
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:52,139
updated and some of the calculators out

525
00:24:48,509 --> 00:24:55,529
there use a static day that's 15 years

526
00:24:52,140 --> 00:25:00,240
so this is updating on a daily basis and

527
00:24:55,529 --> 00:25:02,109
you can see here the ranges this is

528
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:04,028
showing

529
00:25:02,109 --> 00:25:06,668
ethic of New York you would put any

530
00:25:04,028 --> 00:25:10,859
address in the northeast year and you

531
00:25:06,669 --> 00:25:13,778
would put your planting date or put

532
00:25:10,859 --> 00:25:16,240
March if you have one at whatever date

533
00:25:13,778 --> 00:25:19,569
if you have a perennial crop and then

534
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:22,630
you choose your GDD base and it would

535
00:25:19,569 --> 00:25:24,788
show you where you are in the season if

536
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:26,830
you look at the tool right now brian has

537
00:25:24,788 --> 00:25:28,990
not hit the switch to start this growing

538
00:25:26,829 --> 00:25:31,689
season although we just got an email

539
00:25:28,990 --> 00:25:34,990
from a farmer in Virginia asking like

540
00:25:31,690 --> 00:25:36,940
it's already warming it's already the

541
00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:40,720
spring season so we're gonna think about

542
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:43,028
maybe starting the tool earlier but you

543
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:46,058
can go back and look at last year's data

544
00:25:43,028 --> 00:25:49,119
and all the way back I think very far

545
00:25:46,058 --> 00:25:51,308
back many years back so as a planning

546
00:25:49,119 --> 00:25:53,798
tool a farmer can look at what happened

547
00:25:51,308 --> 00:25:57,609
last year or the year before when they

548
00:25:53,798 --> 00:26:00,548
planted what date they planted and Kitty

549
00:25:57,609 --> 00:26:02,829
O'Neil and Elizabeth are planning to do

550
00:26:00,548 --> 00:26:05,319
really short little video clips talk

551
00:26:02,829 --> 00:26:09,428
about four farmers that this is a really

552
00:26:05,319 --> 00:26:12,038
it's an agronomic tool so you if they

553
00:26:09,429 --> 00:26:15,179
can use this to do some planning

554
00:26:12,038 --> 00:26:18,129
decisions about exactly when to plant or

555
00:26:15,179 --> 00:26:19,809
different different crops that they may

556
00:26:18,130 --> 00:26:23,080
plant with different growing degree days

557
00:26:19,808 --> 00:26:25,240
where were they last year where was the

558
00:26:23,079 --> 00:26:27,490
end of the season and makes some much

559
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:31,480
more informed decisions so this is

560
00:26:27,490 --> 00:26:35,259
showing you the period of record here is

561
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:37,450
the black and this was 2016 this is the

562
00:26:35,259 --> 00:26:40,480
growing degree day a cumulation up to

563
00:26:37,450 --> 00:26:42,429
that date we have a forecast here which

564
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:46,298
farmers really like it looks at the next

565
00:26:42,429 --> 00:26:48,940
five six days and then you can see that

566
00:26:46,298 --> 00:26:51,190
it's also just an educational tool

567
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:54,100
because this is the 30 year normal and

568
00:26:51,190 --> 00:26:57,820
this is the 15 year average and

569
00:26:54,099 --> 00:27:00,699
oftentimes this isn't this image image

570
00:26:57,819 --> 00:27:02,980
isn't showing this but oftentimes this

571
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:05,710
growing new gray accumulation for a year

572
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:09,399
will be like way above here I should

573
00:27:05,710 --> 00:27:11,390
have used a different screenshot so any

574
00:27:09,398 --> 00:27:15,259
questions about that

575
00:27:11,390 --> 00:27:18,799
tool so the other tool that we developed

576
00:27:15,259 --> 00:27:22,250
really based on Kitty's input of working

577
00:27:18,798 --> 00:27:26,298
with farmers is that we need a cover

578
00:27:22,250 --> 00:27:29,619
crops scheduler because oftentimes

579
00:27:26,298 --> 00:27:33,319
what's happening is that we have a

580
00:27:29,619 --> 00:27:35,479
unusually wet or cold spring and farmers

581
00:27:33,319 --> 00:27:37,399
can't get into the field to plant and

582
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:40,460
then they're trying to make a decision

583
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:44,380
on whether they can get that cover crop

584
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:47,779
established in time to where it would be

585
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:51,140
enough of a profitable venture by the

586
00:27:47,779 --> 00:27:53,418
end of the season and so we have three

587
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:57,500
cover crops in there now that's the data

588
00:27:53,419 --> 00:27:59,480
that we have working with researchers on

589
00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:03,558
campus if we had other data we could

590
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:07,039
populate this more Brian also added this

591
00:28:03,558 --> 00:28:09,829
feature with farmer input which so shows

592
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:13,210
the last first and last freeze dates

593
00:28:09,829 --> 00:28:17,808
which is really helpful for farmers and

594
00:28:13,210 --> 00:28:21,470
then another tool that we have is this

595
00:28:17,808 --> 00:28:24,099
water deficit calculator and I don't

596
00:28:21,470 --> 00:28:29,360
know what the screenshot is showing here

597
00:28:24,099 --> 00:28:31,459
okay it's showing 2016 and you enter

598
00:28:29,359 --> 00:28:33,709
your soil water capacity and your crop

599
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:35,720
what are you growing when did you plant

600
00:28:33,710 --> 00:28:37,610
it and whether or not you've irrigated

601
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:41,000
if you have not irrigated you just leave

602
00:28:37,609 --> 00:28:45,619
this plank and you will see the chance

603
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:49,849
that you have or might have severe plant

604
00:28:45,619 --> 00:28:53,899
stress based on that crop and it does

605
00:28:49,849 --> 00:28:57,109
have a forecast on there as well so this

606
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:59,600
was a tool that was really useful when

607
00:28:57,109 --> 00:29:03,709
we had the very dry period a few years

608
00:28:59,599 --> 00:29:07,279
ago so the newest tool we've developed

609
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:10,490
is called climate change in my County

610
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:13,700
and it was a conception for a long time

611
00:29:10,490 --> 00:29:15,529
we weren't really sure how maybe

612
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:19,120
farmers are not the most interested in

613
00:29:15,529 --> 00:29:24,109
this but policymakers would be or

614
00:29:19,119 --> 00:29:25,369
agencies county agencies Farm Bureau so

615
00:29:24,109 --> 00:29:28,009
when you go into this

616
00:29:25,369 --> 00:29:30,679
tool it's you would come into the

617
00:29:28,009 --> 00:29:33,619
Northeast right off the bat and it would

618
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:36,110
show you what is though general warming

619
00:29:33,619 --> 00:29:38,509
in each County what's the warming data

620
00:29:36,109 --> 00:29:40,459
and you can see that for the with the

621
00:29:38,509 --> 00:29:42,558
exception of these few counties

622
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:45,410
unfortunately down here in more

623
00:29:42,558 --> 00:29:49,700
conservative West Virginia that wouldn't

624
00:29:45,410 --> 00:29:51,890
would would not want that data but other

625
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:54,319
than that it's been a warming trend and

626
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:57,440
then what you can do is over here you

627
00:29:54,319 --> 00:29:59,509
can pick your county and these are the

628
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:02,799
choices here if you want to see average

629
00:29:59,509 --> 00:30:06,140
temperature high temperature days with

630
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:08,629
highs above 90 degrees growing season

631
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:12,020
length and then total precipitation

632
00:30:08,630 --> 00:30:14,750
extreme precipitation and then you can

633
00:30:12,019 --> 00:30:17,839
also look at the climate change

634
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:22,279
projections for those temperature or

635
00:30:17,839 --> 00:30:26,569
precipitation so this is showing you

636
00:30:22,279 --> 00:30:29,210
that the projected increase in

637
00:30:26,569 --> 00:30:32,359
temperature through the end of the

638
00:30:29,210 --> 00:30:34,640
century based on climate models the data

639
00:30:32,359 --> 00:30:37,909
that we have through the Northeast

640
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:40,370
Regional Climate Center showing in this

641
00:30:37,910 --> 00:30:42,590
county we are projected to get a lot

642
00:30:40,369 --> 00:30:45,339
warmer and it's nice because all of

643
00:30:42,589 --> 00:30:50,029
these dots are the observed data and

644
00:30:45,339 --> 00:30:52,009
there is a trend of a significant trend

645
00:30:50,029 --> 00:30:54,710
in warming and then it shows where we

646
00:30:52,009 --> 00:30:58,579
would be by the end of the century so

647
00:30:54,710 --> 00:31:00,380
this is a long-term planning tool and

648
00:30:58,579 --> 00:31:02,539
that's really where the Institute has

649
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:05,870
been trying to get is we can tell you

650
00:31:02,539 --> 00:31:07,849
how things are more variable we can give

651
00:31:05,869 --> 00:31:10,099
you more accurate information help you

652
00:31:07,849 --> 00:31:12,109
with specific planting cropping

653
00:31:10,099 --> 00:31:15,649
decisions but you can also think long

654
00:31:12,109 --> 00:31:18,619
term the same thing with rainfall like

655
00:31:15,650 --> 00:31:21,320
should I start thinking about irrigation

656
00:31:18,619 --> 00:31:27,079
or or tile drainage if I know that this

657
00:31:21,319 --> 00:31:29,119
is the trend so we do have done more and

658
00:31:27,079 --> 00:31:31,460
more training and outreach these are two

659
00:31:29,119 --> 00:31:34,609
events that we did Twilight meetings on

660
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:37,519
farms in Madison County and Oneida

661
00:31:34,609 --> 00:31:38,959
County last year which were great

662
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:42,170
because we

663
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:44,240
had the soil lab there but we also were

664
00:31:42,170 --> 00:31:47,180
able to demonstrate the tools and this

665
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:48,890
is Kevin gun oh he's a AG expansion

666
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:50,720
specialist so she he was explaining

667
00:31:48,890 --> 00:31:52,730
exactly how you could use that going to

668
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:55,430
breed a calculator with planting

669
00:31:52,730 --> 00:31:58,099
decisions in mind and we have a Wi-Fi

670
00:31:55,430 --> 00:32:03,350
device so it was live people could put

671
00:31:58,099 --> 00:32:05,329
their address in and so I want to switch

672
00:32:03,349 --> 00:32:07,219
just for the last couple minutes and

673
00:32:05,329 --> 00:32:12,500
talk connect this to where we are

674
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:17,360
globally and as Matt mentioned I've gone

675
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:20,089
as a trained in global policy my love is

676
00:32:17,359 --> 00:32:22,939
to work globally and connect that to the

677
00:32:20,089 --> 00:32:25,819
local level this past year I taught

678
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:28,759
global environmental climate science and

679
00:32:25,819 --> 00:32:31,389
policy with Natalie Mahal and we took 17

680
00:32:28,759 --> 00:32:33,710
students to the UN climate change talks

681
00:32:31,390 --> 00:32:37,960
yo.hannes went on the delegation to

682
00:32:33,710 --> 00:32:41,420
Poland in December and when we're at the

683
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:44,000
cop meetings we have a exhibit of

684
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:46,130
Cornell's research climate research and

685
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:49,130
we talk about what we're doing here at

686
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:50,960
Cornell and we have videos and I there's

687
00:32:49,130 --> 00:32:53,300
a huge interest in climate change in

688
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:55,370
agriculture and I talk about the tools

689
00:32:53,299 --> 00:32:58,009
that we have and they say can we get

690
00:32:55,369 --> 00:33:01,279
those tools in our country or what are

691
00:32:58,009 --> 00:33:03,799
you doing in Ethiopia and so we know

692
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:06,980
globally there is a lack of accurate

693
00:33:03,799 --> 00:33:09,430
weather station and climate data there's

694
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:12,200
a huge need and a huge interest in

695
00:33:09,430 --> 00:33:15,200
digital agriculture and decision support

696
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:17,480
tools globally they with Cornell's

697
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:21,529
expertise they could be connected to the

698
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:25,640
landscape scale and there's a need there

699
00:33:21,529 --> 00:33:27,250
also then to develop similar extension

700
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:30,259
or training and outreach programs

701
00:33:27,250 --> 00:33:32,210
globally so we've had a lot of interests

702
00:33:30,259 --> 00:33:35,119
we tried developing a proposal for

703
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:36,980
Pakistan it didn't get funded but the

704
00:33:35,119 --> 00:33:41,839
proposal is still there there's a lot of

705
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:44,059
interest and connecting that to some of

706
00:33:41,839 --> 00:33:49,279
the work that I do as a social scientist

707
00:33:44,059 --> 00:33:51,079
if we think about policy global climate

708
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:52,750
change in agriculture policy

709
00:33:51,079 --> 00:33:55,720
there's

710
00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:57,279
policy that takes place at the national

711
00:33:55,720 --> 00:34:00,670
level through this United Nations

712
00:33:57,279 --> 00:34:02,829
Framework Convention and every single

713
00:34:00,670 --> 00:34:05,920
country that came to the Paris agreement

714
00:34:02,829 --> 00:34:07,779
in 2015 had to come with a national plan

715
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:10,269
of how they were going to reduce

716
00:34:07,779 --> 00:34:15,009
emissions and also many of them included

717
00:34:10,269 --> 00:34:17,530
adaptation and of those probably 60% of

718
00:34:15,010 --> 00:34:19,090
those included climate smart agriculture

719
00:34:17,530 --> 00:34:21,429
in their plan

720
00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:24,720
so they especially countries in

721
00:34:21,429 --> 00:34:28,929
developing developing countries are very

722
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:32,109
keen to work on to get resources and

723
00:34:28,929 --> 00:34:34,450
technology and get help with adaptation

724
00:34:32,110 --> 00:34:38,139
in agriculture and then if we think

725
00:34:34,449 --> 00:34:40,089
about policy you have to think about

726
00:34:38,139 --> 00:34:41,950
what's the national government policy

727
00:34:40,090 --> 00:34:43,899
and how is that global policy going to

728
00:34:41,949 --> 00:34:49,299
be translated to the national level and

729
00:34:43,898 --> 00:34:52,148
then down to the local level and so I

730
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:55,840
could give you a whole talk on the Paris

731
00:34:52,148 --> 00:35:02,170
agreement but basically it's been signed

732
00:34:55,840 --> 00:35:04,900
by 184 parties and the u.s. is still a

733
00:35:02,170 --> 00:35:08,110
signatory to this agreement and every

734
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:10,119
party with the exception of the United

735
00:35:08,110 --> 00:35:13,269
States every country in the world is

736
00:35:10,119 --> 00:35:14,829
party to this agreement now is agreeing

737
00:35:13,269 --> 00:35:17,469
to the goal that we will reduce

738
00:35:14,829 --> 00:35:21,099
emissions to keep our global temperature

739
00:35:17,469 --> 00:35:23,799
at well below two degrees Celsius with

740
00:35:21,099 --> 00:35:25,750
the intention to keep it below 1.5 and

741
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:27,820
if you heard the climate talked last

742
00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:30,159
week from Natalie Mahal she was a lead

743
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:32,950
author on this one point five degree

744
00:35:30,159 --> 00:35:35,440
report from the IPCC that looked at

745
00:35:32,949 --> 00:35:38,739
whether or not this is even possible and

746
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:40,809
so if you think about this global policy

747
00:35:38,739 --> 00:35:43,750
all these countries have agreed to work

748
00:35:40,809 --> 00:35:45,489
on this then how does that translate to

749
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:48,250
the work we need to do on agriculture

750
00:35:45,489 --> 00:35:50,679
and so there is a new process that was

751
00:35:48,250 --> 00:35:52,599
agreed to you at last year's cop called

752
00:35:50,679 --> 00:35:55,419
the koruna be a joint work program on

753
00:35:52,599 --> 00:35:58,000
agriculture it's something where I went

754
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:59,740
to these two track these meetings tried

755
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,599
my best to track these meetings for the

756
00:35:59,739 --> 00:36:03,789
past two years and it

757
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:07,989
basically that the implementation

758
00:36:03,789 --> 00:36:09,489
committee in the UN and the the

759
00:36:07,989 --> 00:36:12,579
Technology Committee are working

760
00:36:09,489 --> 00:36:14,859
together just to think about what are

761
00:36:12,579 --> 00:36:16,929
the global challenges for addressing

762
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:19,809
climate change in agriculture and what

763
00:36:16,929 --> 00:36:21,779
are the needs and at the last cop in

764
00:36:19,809 --> 00:36:25,389
Poland there was an all-day workshop

765
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:27,070
with 11 agencies reporting on what they

766
00:36:25,389 --> 00:36:31,059
are doing on climate smart agriculture

767
00:36:27,070 --> 00:36:36,269
and the United States had representation

768
00:36:31,059 --> 00:36:38,739
there some farm bureau and some other AG

769
00:36:36,269 --> 00:36:42,429
agencies were represented there to try

770
00:36:38,739 --> 00:36:45,099
and track this a key summary from a

771
00:36:42,429 --> 00:36:46,960
group called CGIAR is that these

772
00:36:45,099 --> 00:36:49,269
conferences are crucial to further

773
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:52,329
climate action on agriculture but

774
00:36:49,269 --> 00:36:55,360
progress has been slow over the past 24

775
00:36:52,329 --> 00:36:59,049
years and so we need to think about at

776
00:36:55,360 --> 00:37:00,579
Cornell but also at all these different

777
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:03,400
levels how can we complement the

778
00:37:00,579 --> 00:37:06,210
negotiations with initiatives to speed

779
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:11,309
up adaptation and mitigation in

780
00:37:06,210 --> 00:37:13,780
agriculture and I'll end up the talk by

781
00:37:11,309 --> 00:37:15,610
talking about this concept of climate

782
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:19,600
smart agriculture how many of you are

783
00:37:15,610 --> 00:37:24,280
familiar with it Matt and ok a good

784
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:28,710
number it's really came out in the last

785
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:32,140
few years as a way to advance policy and

786
00:37:28,710 --> 00:37:34,389
work on the ground with farmers and it's

787
00:37:32,139 --> 00:37:37,900
really based on three pillars of looking

788
00:37:34,389 --> 00:37:41,369
at adaptation mitigation and sustainably

789
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:48,460
increasing productivity to reduce global

790
00:37:41,369 --> 00:37:53,319
food insecurity and it came about in

791
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:56,349
2009 there's been some controversy about

792
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:57,850
this term even on our campus where

793
00:37:56,349 --> 00:38:01,480
people have asked me are you sure you

794
00:37:57,849 --> 00:38:03,489
want to work on that because it the

795
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:06,369
controversy is that the term wasn't

796
00:38:03,489 --> 00:38:09,969
well-defined before the concepts we're

797
00:38:06,369 --> 00:38:14,849
not well defined before this got put out

798
00:38:09,969 --> 00:38:17,679
by the FAO and some believe that

799
00:38:14,849 --> 00:38:21,789
global corporations like Monsanto will

800
00:38:17,679 --> 00:38:24,219
have undue influence and be pushing this

801
00:38:21,789 --> 00:38:26,739
agenda to push one agenda where they're

802
00:38:24,219 --> 00:38:29,409
still conflicting ideas about what is

803
00:38:26,739 --> 00:38:31,419
the best way to mitigate climate change

804
00:38:29,409 --> 00:38:34,869
or what's the best way to adapt to

805
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:38,320
climate change in agriculture I really

806
00:38:34,869 --> 00:38:41,019
feel like it's a useful concept and a

807
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:42,670
useful process there is a Global

808
00:38:41,019 --> 00:38:45,670
Alliance for climate smart agriculture

809
00:38:42,670 --> 00:38:47,470
that Cornell is a part of and I try to

810
00:38:45,670 --> 00:38:49,869
help them as much as possible it's just

811
00:38:47,469 --> 00:38:53,849
a voluntary network and they share

812
00:38:49,869 --> 00:38:53,849
information and share resources

813
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:58,599
including with businesses because they

814
00:38:56,349 --> 00:39:00,610
argue that if we don't get companies on

815
00:38:58,599 --> 00:39:02,889
board and be talking with them and

816
00:39:00,610 --> 00:39:05,140
farmer organizations and we're not going

817
00:39:02,889 --> 00:39:07,659
to really make progress we can't just be

818
00:39:05,139 --> 00:39:11,039
working on small-scale agriculture we

819
00:39:07,659 --> 00:39:14,949
have to work on all types of agriculture

820
00:39:11,039 --> 00:39:18,369
and so this is some work that I've done

821
00:39:14,949 --> 00:39:21,159
and I guess I would end up talk by

822
00:39:18,369 --> 00:39:23,289
saying there is a lot of work going on

823
00:39:21,159 --> 00:39:26,500
globally on climate smart agriculture

824
00:39:23,289 --> 00:39:27,849
there's a need to scale up we hear this

825
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:29,619
term all the time

826
00:39:27,849 --> 00:39:31,449
globally there's a need to scale up

827
00:39:29,619 --> 00:39:33,250
adaptation at the same time as

828
00:39:31,449 --> 00:39:35,409
mitigation and sustainable

829
00:39:33,250 --> 00:39:38,650
intensification but there's different

830
00:39:35,409 --> 00:39:41,259
interests and it's really complicated we

831
00:39:38,650 --> 00:39:44,980
need to strengthen capacity and

832
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:47,140
extension and research globally so some

833
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:49,329
key takeaways from the talk and then I'm

834
00:39:47,139 --> 00:39:51,250
happy to answer questions is that

835
00:39:49,329 --> 00:39:55,239
climate change is already affecting

836
00:39:51,250 --> 00:39:57,519
farmers in New York State and globally

837
00:39:55,239 --> 00:39:59,319
it's interesting when you go to the cop

838
00:39:57,519 --> 00:40:02,110
and you actually talk to a farmer from

839
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:03,910
Africa and I'll ask them what what are

840
00:40:02,110 --> 00:40:05,860
you experiencing and they'll say extreme

841
00:40:03,909 --> 00:40:09,480
rainfall events I'll say Wow

842
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:13,269
you see some of the same challenges

843
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:15,219
globally farmers acknowledge they're

844
00:40:13,269 --> 00:40:16,509
experiencing climate change you just

845
00:40:15,219 --> 00:40:19,299
need to figure out the best way to

846
00:40:16,510 --> 00:40:21,670
engage them on this topic um we need

847
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:23,920
social science is really important we

848
00:40:21,670 --> 00:40:26,139
need to understand what farmers think

849
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:28,150
about this issue what tools and

850
00:40:26,139 --> 00:40:29,980
practices they're using

851
00:40:28,150 --> 00:40:33,250
what they have available to them and

852
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:37,179
what they can do what they need to adapt

853
00:40:33,250 --> 00:40:40,239
and mitigate the climate and agriculture

854
00:40:37,179 --> 00:40:42,699
tools can help farmers make much more

855
00:40:40,239 --> 00:40:45,309
informed decisions and I would say I

856
00:40:42,699 --> 00:40:47,529
hear this again and again extension

857
00:40:45,309 --> 00:40:49,779
globally and in New York State is really

858
00:40:47,530 --> 00:40:52,720
critical and there needs to be more

859
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:54,730
funding and support for extension um and

860
00:40:52,719 --> 00:40:57,250
the last point I would make is that I

861
00:40:54,730 --> 00:40:59,199
would love to see more engagement

862
00:40:57,250 --> 00:41:01,809
globally I would love to see Cal say

863
00:40:59,199 --> 00:41:03,549
this is a priority we need to be engaged

864
00:41:01,809 --> 00:41:05,829
globally on climate change in

865
00:41:03,550 --> 00:41:07,810
agriculture is something Johannes has

866
00:41:05,829 --> 00:41:12,269
really been talking about for a long

867
00:41:07,809 --> 00:41:12,269
time so that's

868
00:41:12,789 --> 00:41:18,869
[Applause]

869
00:41:22,119 --> 00:41:29,179
hi hi so here's a bill in front of the

870
00:41:26,869 --> 00:41:32,449
New York State Legislature or Carbon

871
00:41:29,179 --> 00:41:36,049
Farming just reproduced with a bunch of

872
00:41:32,449 --> 00:41:41,480
new sponsors on it and the plan would be

873
00:41:36,050 --> 00:41:43,730
to subsidize farmers for the economic

874
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:47,300
value of the carbon sequestered by

875
00:41:43,730 --> 00:41:51,110
various types of our farm practices that

876
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:53,090
would be a tax credit so just comments

877
00:41:51,110 --> 00:41:56,030
on with your stability with the hill

878
00:41:53,090 --> 00:41:59,059
weather I mean agate markets are

879
00:41:56,030 --> 00:42:01,250
supposed to come up with this model

880
00:41:59,059 --> 00:42:02,960
which I think they're probably not quite

881
00:42:01,250 --> 00:42:05,690
up to that task you know given their

882
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:08,179
presence that thing but just thoughts

883
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:10,280
about that model and whether the science

884
00:42:08,179 --> 00:42:13,009
is there to make this ready for

885
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:25,160
primetime and whether they contact you

886
00:42:13,010 --> 00:42:27,230
without I have heard about the bill

887
00:42:25,159 --> 00:42:28,730
filtering through I don't know the

888
00:42:27,230 --> 00:42:31,940
prospects that it's gonna get passed

889
00:42:28,730 --> 00:42:34,550
this year but it is something that we

890
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:37,659
should be tracking I didn't mention it

891
00:42:34,550 --> 00:42:41,539
but there is a New York State climate

892
00:42:37,659 --> 00:42:45,980
resilient farm initiative and most of

893
00:42:41,539 --> 00:42:49,489
that funding goes to Ag and markets to

894
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:53,300
put technology in place like manure

895
00:42:49,489 --> 00:42:55,939
covers through the AG Environment

896
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:59,300
Program AEM there has been a little bit

897
00:42:55,940 --> 00:43:01,280
of research funding that came here so I

898
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:05,300
haven't really tracked that bill other

899
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:07,940
than I knew it was out there yeah they

900
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:11,690
counted for coming to talk to us I'd

901
00:43:07,940 --> 00:43:16,010
like your opinion on the disconnection

902
00:43:11,690 --> 00:43:17,929
from the aims or units in your program

903
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:19,850
and some of the additional

904
00:43:17,929 --> 00:43:22,369
recommendations that are coming on

905
00:43:19,849 --> 00:43:25,469
University that are really countered to

906
00:43:22,369 --> 00:43:28,348
that notably our recommendation for late

907
00:43:25,469 --> 00:43:31,379
I didn't manifest they're not adaptive

908
00:43:28,349 --> 00:43:33,780
they're not mitigative they allow for

909
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:36,088
highly excessive rates been warned that

910
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:38,430
management fertilizer rate implications

911
00:43:36,088 --> 00:43:40,619
on carbon sequestration batches oxide

912
00:43:38,429 --> 00:43:43,649
emissions and so there's really this

913
00:43:40,619 --> 00:43:45,920
contradiction between what progressive

914
00:43:43,650 --> 00:43:49,500
programs like yours are trying to do and

915
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:57,599
what we stand for as an institution in

916
00:43:49,500 --> 00:44:00,630
terms of I'm aware of the of the

917
00:43:57,599 --> 00:44:15,240
challenge what do you think we could do

918
00:44:00,630 --> 00:44:18,059
to bridge that the best ways to get

919
00:44:15,239 --> 00:44:22,199
farmers to I don't know the best tools

920
00:44:18,059 --> 00:44:24,500
and information well there's a lot of

921
00:44:22,199 --> 00:44:28,919
things that we sort of fish you promote

922
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:30,809
guidelines and and maybe it's time to is

923
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:33,240
we have programs like this which I think

924
00:44:30,809 --> 00:44:35,759
it's great and I support it's time to

925
00:44:33,239 --> 00:44:38,669
kind of revisit what we are otherwise

926
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:41,000
recommending and somebody's recommending

927
00:44:38,670 --> 00:44:44,159
that regulations are highly updated and

928
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:59,480
and so you know we have very limited

929
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:59,480
credibility on the one hand yes

930
00:45:00,349 --> 00:45:13,610
so my question is I'm one guy he was

931
00:45:09,380 --> 00:45:16,550
born 100 percent agency in regards to

932
00:45:13,610 --> 00:45:19,610
each development these payments are in

933
00:45:16,550 --> 00:45:22,519
schools and their ability to use them on

934
00:45:19,610 --> 00:45:24,680
their part day vibrates have a hundred

935
00:45:22,519 --> 00:45:28,039
percent changes either totally in charge

936
00:45:24,679 --> 00:45:37,250
of what they're doing they're giving him

937
00:45:28,039 --> 00:45:41,779
our mercy system by its own forces their

938
00:45:37,250 --> 00:45:53,690
hand decision I pushed him on that

939
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:55,700
spectrum where he ever thought so that's

940
00:45:53,690 --> 00:45:59,329
a great question no one's ever asked me

941
00:45:55,699 --> 00:46:02,809
that before so what what are you

942
00:45:59,329 --> 00:46:05,539
thinking of the decisions that are not

943
00:46:02,809 --> 00:46:07,940
that they can't because of the system

944
00:46:05,539 --> 00:46:12,650
are you thinking because of seed that

945
00:46:07,940 --> 00:46:17,269
they have to buy or like when I think

946
00:46:12,650 --> 00:46:22,639
about dairy farms right now the price is

947
00:46:17,269 --> 00:46:25,489
so low you need to produce mill work not

948
00:46:22,639 --> 00:46:33,559
to stay solvent which then leads to

949
00:46:25,489 --> 00:46:37,189
ensuring the center of sure so okay so I

950
00:46:33,559 --> 00:46:39,289
guess I would say to that that this is a

951
00:46:37,190 --> 00:46:42,550
challenging time to talk about climate

952
00:46:39,289 --> 00:46:45,320
change in this for the dairy industry

953
00:46:42,550 --> 00:46:49,300
right now because they are not going to

954
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:51,559
be able to take make large investments

955
00:46:49,300 --> 00:46:55,250
they just don't have the money to do

956
00:46:51,559 --> 00:46:59,779
that but I would I would say that it's

957
00:46:55,250 --> 00:47:01,760
an additional stress or to them and if

958
00:46:59,780 --> 00:47:04,700
they're already doing things like

959
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:06,920
they're already plant thinking about

960
00:47:04,699 --> 00:47:09,589
l'hotel or they're thinking about soil

961
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:11,240
health they're many of the progressive

962
00:47:09,590 --> 00:47:12,320
farmers are doing a lot of these

963
00:47:11,239 --> 00:47:17,059
practices

964
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:19,039
or not new then making them aware that

965
00:47:17,059 --> 00:47:21,799
over time if they do these things or

966
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:24,250
they prioritize if they know that

967
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:26,780
flooding in this area of the farm is

968
00:47:24,250 --> 00:47:29,659
where they're getting hit the most then

969
00:47:26,780 --> 00:47:31,720
they prioritize adaptations that would

970
00:47:29,659 --> 00:47:36,129
help with that

971
00:47:31,719 --> 00:47:38,459
right did I answer try to answer your

972
00:47:36,130 --> 00:47:44,108
question okay

973
00:47:38,460 --> 00:47:47,139
yes kindness but I see from your

974
00:47:44,108 --> 00:47:48,449
presentation that extension is pretty

975
00:47:47,139 --> 00:47:51,549
involved where you're targeting

976
00:47:48,449 --> 00:47:53,500
individual parts and introducing them to

977
00:47:51,550 --> 00:47:55,980
these tools are helping them we use

978
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:59,619
digital I that have been developed

979
00:47:55,980 --> 00:48:02,409
collection that it's going into unlike

980
00:47:59,619 --> 00:48:09,220
how much work would you say is brilliant

981
00:48:02,409 --> 00:48:12,489
to looking at larger organizations and

982
00:48:09,219 --> 00:48:16,118
people or policies that mean a great

983
00:48:12,489 --> 00:48:19,289
point great point I mean if I had more

984
00:48:16,119 --> 00:48:21,519
time and I am a policy person so I

985
00:48:19,289 --> 00:48:24,730
understand that we need to be thinking

986
00:48:21,519 --> 00:48:28,119
about how do we interact with Farm

987
00:48:24,730 --> 00:48:31,000
Bureau or how do we make changes as

988
00:48:28,119 --> 00:48:33,818
cornell to the farm bill that just got

989
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:36,309
passed or we think about state and

990
00:48:33,818 --> 00:48:39,849
national policy the way we've tried to

991
00:48:36,309 --> 00:48:41,619
do that is just stay engaged with new

992
00:48:39,849 --> 00:48:44,859
york state agencies and let them know

993
00:48:41,619 --> 00:48:47,890
the resources we have but we were not

994
00:48:44,858 --> 00:48:52,029
being asked to do Policy Analysis maybe

995
00:48:47,889 --> 00:48:57,719
Peter is or others but we could be doing

996
00:48:52,030 --> 00:48:57,720
more in that area as Cornell

997
00:49:01,409 --> 00:49:27,960
yeah we're out of time but well they may

998
00:49:26,070 --> 00:49:31,650
be interested in protecting the land but

999
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:33,630
they own very small plots so it is a

1000
00:49:31,650 --> 00:49:36,059
challenge and that's why I think we

1001
00:49:33,630 --> 00:49:38,340
can't just have these global initiatives

1002
00:49:36,059 --> 00:49:40,710
we need to look at what every country is

1003
00:49:38,340 --> 00:49:43,140
doing - what if what are they proposing

1004
00:49:40,710 --> 00:49:45,329
for adaptation and climate change and if

1005
00:49:43,139 --> 00:49:47,879
you look at it it's often very vague and

1006
00:49:45,329 --> 00:49:49,349
then even if they have a national policy

1007
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:53,930
is that actually getting implemented

1008
00:49:49,349 --> 00:49:57,989
with input from farmers on the ground so

1009
00:49:53,929 --> 00:50:01,139
we have Humphrey fellows here and we had

1010
00:49:57,989 --> 00:50:03,389
a really interested fellow who is now

1011
00:50:01,139 --> 00:50:07,049
the climate change in agriculture focal

1012
00:50:03,389 --> 00:50:08,879
point / Punjab Pakistan and she's on

1013
00:50:07,050 --> 00:50:13,080
Facebook and she posted that they have a

1014
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:16,140
brand new CSA plan and her idea she

1015
00:50:13,079 --> 00:50:19,920
wanted these decision tools to be put in

1016
00:50:16,139 --> 00:50:21,809
place with a plan that every farmer the

1017
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:23,930
government just paid every farmer to get

1018
00:50:21,809 --> 00:50:27,480
a smartphone even if they're really

1019
00:50:23,929 --> 00:50:30,169
small-scale farmers and so we could be

1020
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:33,360
doing alerts we could be sending out

1021
00:50:30,170 --> 00:50:35,490
alerts of when they might see a pasture

1022
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:37,620
when they might need to irrigate and so

1023
00:50:35,489 --> 00:50:41,549
I think people are thinking about it

1024
00:50:37,619 --> 00:50:45,559
it's a really big challenge and

1025
00:50:41,550 --> 00:50:45,560
something exciting to think about

1026
00:50:50,849 --> 00:50:59,699
this has been a production of Cornell

1027
