1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:04,359
issues or concerns that they've had with

2
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:05,599
what they've been doing um in order to

3
00:00:04,359 --> 00:00:10,000
do deep Zone

4
00:00:05,599 --> 00:00:14,638
pillage recommendations to grow I

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,638
got can I see it I

6
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,960
didn't

7
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:47,799
um are there particular

8
00:00:45,159 --> 00:00:49,279
photos either of you would like to put

9
00:00:47,799 --> 00:00:52,558
up

10
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:56,039
there go ahead I don't have a problem

11
00:00:52,558 --> 00:01:00,399
the only one of mine there is 13 or 20

12
00:00:56,039 --> 00:01:02,439
20 20 is my okay 20 is my little tiller

13
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:03,679
see you did H pictures up there huh I

14
00:01:02,439 --> 00:01:06,438
told you you had pictures up there I

15
00:01:03,679 --> 00:01:06,438
know that's the only

16
00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:13,920
one

17
00:01:09,959 --> 00:01:16,879
okay but you also have an uner I've got

18
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:19,359
a six row uner for the for my main crops

19
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:21,879
cuz I'm primarily a grain grower but I

20
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:23,640
built that two Row for my strawberries

21
00:01:21,879 --> 00:01:25,640
and uh it's a pretty simple little

22
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:28,159
machine and as you can tell right there

23
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:30,359
it works awfully good if you're as long

24
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:32,079
as you have your cover crop or

25
00:01:30,359 --> 00:01:34,118
clean ground ahead of time in other

26
00:01:32,078 --> 00:01:36,599
words that's a field that had Rye in it

27
00:01:34,118 --> 00:01:38,239
was sprayed in the fall and I use that

28
00:01:36,599 --> 00:01:40,118
for strawberri so I'm doing that about

29
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:41,879
the first week in April or last week in

30
00:01:40,118 --> 00:01:43,319
March as soon as I can get in the field

31
00:01:41,879 --> 00:01:46,118
to get it ready so I can plant my

32
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:48,679
strawberries in April and uh all it is

33
00:01:46,118 --> 00:01:53,078
is two chisel Shanks and then two sets

34
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:56,520
of closing covering uh for um cters on

35
00:01:53,078 --> 00:01:58,919
the back to shape up a ridge um it's a

36
00:01:56,519 --> 00:02:01,158
two machine I pull it about 13 or 14

37
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:03,759
inches deep and I'm pulling it with a 30

38
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:06,600
horsepower tractor right there is all

39
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:08,118
but there's no fancy equipment on it if

40
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:11,719
I had the only thing I would have to be

41
00:02:08,118 --> 00:02:13,800
different if I had a uh a cover crop a

42
00:02:11,719 --> 00:02:16,000
heavy cover crop ahead of time I'd need

43
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,280
a cter in front of that to cut through

44
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
and there's a tool bar in the front

45
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,239
there I made so I could put one on but

46
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,479
I've never needed it so I've only got

47
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:26,159
just the the chisels in the middle and

48
00:02:23,479 --> 00:02:30,759
the cters in the back and how deep are

49
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:32,519
the chisels about 13 or 14 in

50
00:02:30,759 --> 00:02:34,799
no fertilizer or anything on mean it'd

51
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:37,319
be easy to put a little tank on there

52
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,879
and run a a hose with a nozzle down the

53
00:02:37,318 --> 00:02:41,039
back of each chisel point you could put

54
00:02:38,878 --> 00:02:42,759
fertilizer 8 in deep if you were going

55
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:44,799
to grow sweet corn or some other crop

56
00:02:42,759 --> 00:02:47,039
that needed nitrogen you could put it on

57
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:49,080
with that 8 Ines or so put about half

58
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:50,799
your nitrogen on early with that and

59
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:53,000
then put the other half on top when you

60
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:56,319
plant your crop but I don't need it for

61
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,318
the berries so I don't do

62
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:03,319
that any question questions about

63
00:03:03,719 --> 00:03:10,039
that and then uh where is an unreferred

64
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:13,039
slide um

65
00:03:10,039 --> 00:03:13,039
Betsy

66
00:03:14,318 --> 00:03:20,798
yeah why machine isn't in there it's too

67
00:03:16,878 --> 00:03:25,679
big Betsy where is an uner slide over

68
00:03:20,799 --> 00:03:28,400
number number 16 looks like a good bit

69
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:31,080
okay one above it too isn't it one uh it

70
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,840
might be one right that one there yeah

71
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:36,280
that might be an unreferred that's there

72
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:40,479
that one is the one above it

73
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:41,640
nine yeah that's an unre machine yeah

74
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:45,199
that's like

75
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:47,639
mine yep and uh the advantages

76
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:49,158
disadvantages of

77
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:51,798
that

78
00:03:49,158 --> 00:03:53,438
well that that the only difference

79
00:03:51,799 --> 00:03:55,360
between that and mine I've replaced

80
00:03:53,438 --> 00:03:57,840
those baskets on the back with CER

81
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:59,879
Packer uh little rollers CER Packer

82
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:02,680
Wheels I think it makes a little more it

83
00:03:59,878 --> 00:04:04,919
makes a better uh rad to plant in

84
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:06,640
because it firms the soil a little bit

85
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:08,759
uh I like that machine because it's got

86
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:11,158
the straight Shanks we've all we're

87
00:04:08,759 --> 00:04:13,078
trying to do with that is to make a slot

88
00:04:11,158 --> 00:04:15,759
in the ground that the plant roots can

89
00:04:13,079 --> 00:04:17,840
follow down is below the compacted

90
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:19,918
layers I like that better than the

91
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:22,239
parabolic shanks because the parabolic

92
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:24,879
shanks pull up more Stones than that

93
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:26,639
will so that's a if you're in a Stony

94
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:30,439
situation that machine is a cleaner one

95
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:33,079
to run um I've been using my for 15

96
00:04:30,439 --> 00:04:34,839
years and it pulls you know takes about

97
00:04:33,079 --> 00:04:36,959
half as much power to pull it now as it

98
00:04:34,839 --> 00:04:39,279
did when I started it gets better and

99
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:41,918
better every single year in fact I'm to

100
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:43,719
the point now on my gravel and good LOM

101
00:04:41,918 --> 00:04:45,959
ground I don't do that anymore I just

102
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:47,919
strip till plant on top of the ground

103
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:50,560
but in the heavier ground heavy clay I

104
00:04:47,918 --> 00:04:52,038
still do that and uh but I put Coler

105
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,918
Packer Wheels on the back to break the

106
00:04:52,038 --> 00:04:56,319
clouds up and do a little compaction on

107
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:59,240
that road firm it up before I'm going to

108
00:04:56,319 --> 00:05:01,519
plant I prefer to do it in the fall if

109
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:03,240
somebody body needed to know when in

110
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:05,120
which case I take that back piece right

111
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:06,840
off I don't need to firm the slot and I

112
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:09,399
don't need to use the basket so I just

113
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:11,799
have the closing discs and the big shank

114
00:05:09,399 --> 00:05:14,359
in the front in the fall and then let

115
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:15,918
mother nature take care of of uh firming

116
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:17,800
up the row and then just went and plan

117
00:05:15,918 --> 00:05:21,120
on it in the spring so I prefer to do it

118
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:23,038
in the fall if I have a choice um loosen

119
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,959
the ground and get that slot made so

120
00:05:23,038 --> 00:05:26,759
that freezing and thawing and whatever

121
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:28,318
will take care of it but if you have to

122
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:30,319
do it in the spring then you need either

123
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:31,800
that basket or color pack of wheels or

124
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:33,080
something on the back or you're going to

125
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:35,800
have the soil is going to be too loose

126
00:05:33,079 --> 00:05:37,279
to plant in well you can plant in it but

127
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:39,120
it's better if you put something on the

128
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:40,879
back there that doesn't really break up

129
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:43,519
the clouds that well no that was a the

130
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:45,319
problem George did mine before I started

131
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:46,399
um he and I talked about I said I wonder

132
00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:47,960
what would happen if you put a color

133
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:50,679
Packer wheel on there cuz I've got

134
00:05:47,959 --> 00:05:52,680
cloudier ground than he does and works

135
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:54,079
better yeah that he did it afterwards

136
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:56,038
and that was uh that seem to be the

137
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:59,758
answer for breaking the clouds up yeah

138
00:05:56,038 --> 00:06:02,599
especially in that um we had a dry year

139
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:05,400
and then we really wanted people to go

140
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:07,599
to the culter Packers to seal that

141
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:11,318
moisture that's right that's right if it

142
00:06:07,598 --> 00:06:12,800
was wet um maybe then the basket's okay

143
00:06:11,319 --> 00:06:15,199
because it'll probably break the clouds

144
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,759
up if it's wet anyway the question in

145
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:18,960
two things in the heavy ground which is

146
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:20,598
where that thing really is needed you're

147
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:22,120
going to get clouds if you get clouds

148
00:06:20,598 --> 00:06:23,800
you got to do something with them you

149
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:25,199
don't just leave them there to dry out

150
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:27,199
and get hard and then try to plant

151
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:28,759
through them so you you know if the

152
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:30,919
basket will break up your clouds fine

153
00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:33,038
and dandy if won't the cuip Packer

154
00:06:30,918 --> 00:06:34,879
wheels will do a better job of that but

155
00:06:33,038 --> 00:06:36,879
if it's really really wet you're going

156
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:38,719
to get too much with that you know then

157
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:40,159
you got to take the spring off and do

158
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:42,800
everything to keep it so it doesn't push

159
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:44,400
down quite so hard and so it's a it's a

160
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,360
question every year what the ground is

161
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:48,079
like what kind of soil is it what field

162
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:49,720
you're in you don't do it the same way

163
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:52,598
in every field every year you have to be

164
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:55,160
able to make some adjustments but the

165
00:06:52,598 --> 00:06:57,000
the shank the The Cutting disc in the

166
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:58,639
front the shank and then the two closing

167
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
discs stay the same no matter where you

168
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:02,519
are and that's all you use in the fall

169
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,360
and and that's another reason I like to

170
00:07:02,519 --> 00:07:06,519
do it in the fall because it's generally

171
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:08,280
drier in the fall the soil's in better

172
00:07:06,519 --> 00:07:09,918
condition and you're not worried about

173
00:07:08,279 --> 00:07:12,119
it wet in the spring because if you do

174
00:07:09,918 --> 00:07:14,240
it in the fall make your Row in the fall

175
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:16,560
it'll dry out in the spring if it's a

176
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:18,360
wet spring all by itself and the clouds

177
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,680
will be gone from from Mother Nature so

178
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:22,038
you don't have to deal with those issues

179
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:24,120
if you do your your deep tail or your

180
00:07:22,038 --> 00:07:26,038
ripping in the fall I think that's a

181
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:28,918
better way to

182
00:07:26,038 --> 00:07:30,399
go one of one of the things that uh I

183
00:07:28,918 --> 00:07:33,120
would have I've kind of toyed with the

184
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:35,159
idea of adding to mine was um a set of

185
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:38,439
rolling baskets not rolling baskets but

186
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:41,840
um trash uh trash cleaners in front of

187
00:07:38,439 --> 00:07:47,038
the the Ripper Point

188
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:50,638
uh yeah um just when we're using the one

189
00:07:47,038 --> 00:07:52,680
row Setter to set either seeds or uh

190
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:55,680
transplants trash can be a problem if

191
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:57,319
you let it get too too tall and uh even

192
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,639
if you kill it round up if you let it

193
00:07:57,319 --> 00:08:01,158
get Woody at all you got to kind of keep

194
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:03,079
it you spray it when it's in a grass

195
00:08:01,158 --> 00:08:07,120
single blade form or you're going to run

196
00:08:03,079 --> 00:08:10,079
into problems well um okay we've got uh

197
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:13,800
what what slide is that that you're

198
00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:16,158
referring to here now with the Trash

199
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:19,038
Wheels let's

200
00:08:16,158 --> 00:08:24,279
see um can you hear me Carol it's number

201
00:08:19,038 --> 00:08:24,279
eight number eight okay

202
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:30,079
yep so when I built my unit I didn't

203
00:08:27,918 --> 00:08:32,559
leave enough room to put any stuff on

204
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:36,120
um I didn't really think about pre roll

205
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:38,199
I was trying to get um a real aggressive

206
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:40,519
point on the thing to get down deep and

207
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:42,719
um I've tried to put stuff after it and

208
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:43,839
it doesn't really work I guess I could

209
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:45,600
probably put a set of roll cleaners

210
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:47,640
right before my my Hiller disc in the

211
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:50,240
back um you know that could possibly

212
00:08:47,639 --> 00:08:53,000
work or run it after run the Hiller disc

213
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,959
and then run these after um I've kind of

214
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,679
I've looked at the things several

215
00:08:53,958 --> 00:08:57,639
different ways and I've got it set

216
00:08:55,679 --> 00:09:00,559
pretty good so it works well the way it

217
00:08:57,639 --> 00:09:01,759
is so I just I've never really taken the

218
00:09:00,559 --> 00:09:03,719
time to mess with putting these things

219
00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:05,480
on but see those in that picture are

220
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:07,600
like my planner you put those on the

221
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:09,079
front of your planner yeah so I'm I'm

222
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,680
wondering why you couldn't put those on

223
00:09:09,078 --> 00:09:13,000
the front of your transplanter that's

224
00:09:10,679 --> 00:09:14,159
where they belong clean that road just

225
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,480
before you get right there with the

226
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:17,159
transplanter yeah but you have to don't

227
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:19,320
you have to go like 5 miles an hour or

228
00:09:17,159 --> 00:09:21,759
something make work they'll work that

229
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:25,760
slow yep on a transp well I'm not sure

230
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:28,000
they work place inther half properly the

231
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:29,720
floating ones which you know got the

232
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,440
depth B

233
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:34,320
that's that does a nice job of cleaning

234
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:36,399
even at the like a qu M hour half really

235
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:38,120
just like a garden R okay okay trying to

236
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:40,559
R the cloud and that's then you don't

237
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:42,560
have to deal with garage out of the way

238
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:43,759
but they got to be free floating right

239
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:45,559
at least might they got to have those

240
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:48,278
Wheels Treader Wheels on the side depth

241
00:09:45,559 --> 00:09:51,679
wheels so they don't go too deep

242
00:09:48,278 --> 00:09:55,838
okay the floating ones will never make a

243
00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:59,120
gouge a trench great too many get you

244
00:09:55,839 --> 00:10:00,920
know our complex topography Hills

245
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:03,120
sideways everything they they will gouge

246
00:10:00,919 --> 00:10:05,039
on you sometimes that's not good you go

247
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,799
too fast or you have them too deep and

248
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:09,360
then you end up with a depression with

249
00:10:06,799 --> 00:10:12,039
all this junk on the side collects water

250
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:14,480
and yeah collect it collects water and

251
00:10:12,039 --> 00:10:16,838
it's it's murder if you got uh

252
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:19,399
processing snap beans or dry beans

253
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:21,760
because you've got your row is below is

254
00:10:19,399 --> 00:10:23,519
starting below the level of the soil

255
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:27,319
snap beans need to have that mini Mount

256
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:29,759
still intact so that so um uh Carol and

257
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:32,839
um Jim and Lynn and George um I have

258
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:35,039
this picture up this is Anu um of the

259
00:10:32,839 --> 00:10:37,720
The Trash Wheels and I do know that umer

260
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:40,078
has made an adapt uh they have created

261
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:42,360
um a mounting unit for in front of the

262
00:10:40,078 --> 00:10:44,439
cutting disc that you can actually put

263
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:46,440
trash CLE that's where it belongs right

264
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:47,720
on the disc that's where it belongs

265
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:49,560
right in front of the cutting disc

266
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:51,759
they've made a unit so I wanted to make

267
00:10:49,559 --> 00:10:53,759
sure folks are new about that um I

268
00:10:51,759 --> 00:10:56,360
before we move around for questions I

269
00:10:53,759 --> 00:10:58,200
wanted to see if um uh Lynn if you had

270
00:10:56,360 --> 00:11:01,039
any other comments on how you got

271
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:01,040
started

272
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:08,120
um well basically I was struggling on on

273
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:11,679
either dry years or excessively dry

274
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:13,959
years or excessively wet years um my

275
00:11:11,679 --> 00:11:17,638
ground would pond on a wet year and on a

276
00:11:13,958 --> 00:11:19,199
dry year nothing would grow um that's

277
00:11:17,639 --> 00:11:21,320
kind of what got me started into it and

278
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:24,560
between a little urging from George and

279
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:25,800
um Gary site we had tried Zone tillage

280
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:29,119
without any

281
00:11:25,799 --> 00:11:30,240
ripping first year I had tried it I I

282
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,679
thought that's where I had to go cuz it

283
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,079
worked it was beautiful we got a rain

284
00:11:31,679 --> 00:11:34,319
right after I planted everything came

285
00:11:33,078 --> 00:11:36,359
out of the ground the pumpkins were

286
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:39,320
beautiful that year the next year I

287
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:43,039
expanded again had George uh plant my

288
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:45,440
winter squash in pumpkins and it was a

289
00:11:43,039 --> 00:11:46,799
total failure it was so dry that year uh

290
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,680
the plants didn't germinate when they

291
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:51,799
did germinate they really didn't grow

292
00:11:48,679 --> 00:11:54,439
well um the missing ingredient seemed to

293
00:11:51,799 --> 00:11:56,759
be the ripping and making that slot

294
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:59,639
giving it a place to grow uh the

295
00:11:56,759 --> 00:12:01,600
following year if you go back uh um do

296
00:11:59,639 --> 00:12:03,799
your pictures there I started out with a

297
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,159
one shank Ripper that I it was just a

298
00:12:03,799 --> 00:12:08,240
subsoiler I had that I used for some

299
00:12:05,159 --> 00:12:08,240
drainage it's picture number

300
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:12,959
six U that's that was my first

301
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:15,759
experiment right there I I took that

302
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:17,879
went down through and I ripped four rows

303
00:12:15,759 --> 00:12:19,919
um in the middle of a tomato field on a

304
00:12:17,879 --> 00:12:23,120
clay null where nothing would grow

305
00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:24,479
anyway with the attitude that if nothing

306
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:26,519
if it doesn't work well nothing was

307
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:29,159
going to grow there anyway so I'm really

308
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:33,159
not out anything um I went through with

309
00:12:29,159 --> 00:12:35,000
Then followed up with a a cub with

310
00:12:33,159 --> 00:12:36,399
Hiller discs on it we went back and

311
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,958
forth through a couple times break the

312
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:41,839
clouds up trans used a conventional

313
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:43,239
transplanter planted into it first thing

314
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:44,720
I noticed was the transplanter worked

315
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:48,278
better than it ever had before planning

316
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:50,040
on that mound a nice soft Mound second

317
00:12:48,278 --> 00:12:51,838
thing I noticed was again it was a it

318
00:12:50,039 --> 00:12:53,480
started out to be a really dry spring

319
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:55,040
the transplants hit the ground and just

320
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:56,720
started running from the minute they hit

321
00:12:55,039 --> 00:12:59,519
the ground the the plants looked way

322
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:02,639
better than the tomato plants on either

323
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:04,519
side of the four rows the test strip all

324
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:06,320
season long I mean us the they grew

325
00:13:04,519 --> 00:13:08,159
faster it looked like I had you know

326
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:11,519
used a different fertilizer program or

327
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:13,159
something everything was the same um we

328
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:14,560
had pictures somewhere I don't know if

329
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:16,120
we have them here today or not but the

330
00:13:14,559 --> 00:13:17,679
final result with the the yield

331
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:19,959
difference was

332
00:13:17,679 --> 00:13:21,078
unbelievable uh quality everything the

333
00:13:19,958 --> 00:13:24,198
tomatoes were bigger there was more

334
00:13:21,078 --> 00:13:26,799
tomatoes on a plant um so that was

335
00:13:24,198 --> 00:13:29,799
that's what got me started and I've been

336
00:13:26,799 --> 00:13:33,479
experimenting ever since um I think it's

337
00:13:29,799 --> 00:13:36,078
pitcher 28 or 21 or something um the

338
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:37,600
following year I built a two row unit

339
00:13:36,078 --> 00:13:39,679
which included the Hillary disc try to

340
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:43,519
do everything in one

341
00:13:39,679 --> 00:13:48,000
pass was in the PTT you sent us um yeah

342
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:49,639
but she cut some okay would so many okay

343
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,799
it's similar to George's actually but

344
00:13:49,639 --> 00:13:55,159
the only difference is I've got straight

345
00:13:50,799 --> 00:13:57,919
Shanks on mine um and I've got a a set

346
00:13:55,159 --> 00:13:59,719
of spider wheels that run behind the

347
00:13:57,919 --> 00:14:01,519
Ripper

348
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:03,959
uh Ripper shank to to kind of break up

349
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:05,278
the clouds and um it does roll some of

350
00:14:03,958 --> 00:14:07,159
the side and stuff out of the way a

351
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:10,278
little bit and then it's followed up by

352
00:14:07,159 --> 00:14:13,198
two Hiller discs they um the

353
00:14:10,278 --> 00:14:15,879
concave Hiller discs okay to to throw a

354
00:14:13,198 --> 00:14:17,599
nice the mound I throw is probably like

355
00:14:15,879 --> 00:14:19,720
8 to 10 inches high I like a good High

356
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:23,320
Mound so after it settles you you've

357
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:24,800
still got a mound there but um every

358
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:29,278
experiment that I've done with this so

359
00:14:24,799 --> 00:14:31,078
far has been positive um from planting

360
00:14:29,278 --> 00:14:32,679
four rows I've take that two row Ripper

361
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:35,838
and go out in the middle of a 10 acre

362
00:14:32,679 --> 00:14:38,239
cornfield and rip four rows plant

363
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:39,440
directly into it you can drive across

364
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,759
the end of the field on a pickup truck

365
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:43,160
don't even get out of the truck the corn

366
00:14:40,759 --> 00:14:45,839
is 6 Ines to a foot taller than the corn

367
00:14:43,159 --> 00:14:47,679
on both sides of it it's just I haven't

368
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:50,759
had one bad experience with it yet it

369
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:53,799
seems for me it's been the way to go you

370
00:14:50,759 --> 00:14:58,039
you had a significant compaction problem

371
00:14:53,799 --> 00:15:00,719
yes on a light soil right yeah it

372
00:14:58,039 --> 00:15:04,360
wouldn't per at all

373
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:08,639
right which is Not Unusual on vegetable

374
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:12,519
soil till panss yeah so so I um I wanted

375
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:14,440
to just H here um I wanted to take a a

376
00:15:12,519 --> 00:15:15,959
minute to go around all the locations

377
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:17,440
and see if we had any questions because

378
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:19,159
we wanted to move on to some of the

379
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:21,480
Growers on Long Island who have used

380
00:15:19,159 --> 00:15:22,958
different equipment so before we move on

381
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:24,959
I'm going to just look at the Growers

382
00:15:22,958 --> 00:15:26,439
that are here with us in the room in

383
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:29,518
itha do you have any questions for

384
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:31,360
George yes go ahead George when you when

385
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:33,159
you uh till in the fall do you have a

386
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:37,000
hard time finding your rose in the

387
00:15:33,159 --> 00:15:40,679
spring no no CU I end up with about a 6

388
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:42,600
in 6 to 7 in wide clean tilled strip

389
00:15:40,679 --> 00:15:45,039
there with a mound and it's still

390
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:47,920
visible in the spring I mean you have to

391
00:15:45,039 --> 00:15:50,360
do fall weed control is the best option

392
00:15:47,919 --> 00:15:51,759
for Zone tillage anyway and so the

393
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:53,278
strips are still there in the spring I

394
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:55,399
don't have any

395
00:15:53,278 --> 00:15:57,799
trouble we have one more question from

396
00:15:55,399 --> 00:15:59,879
itha are you doing that zone tilling in

397
00:15:57,799 --> 00:16:02,198
the fall into into a cover crop that'll

398
00:15:59,879 --> 00:16:06,958
winter kill or into a rye that's still

399
00:16:02,198 --> 00:16:08,838
alive in the spring or near uh no both a

400
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:10,239
lot of it is into soybean ground that's

401
00:16:08,839 --> 00:16:12,000
going to go back to sweet corn or

402
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:14,600
something so there isn't any cover crop

403
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:17,240
there it's too late I may plant Rye but

404
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:18,839
then I do the the Deep till early enough

405
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:20,600
that the rise is barely coming up it

406
00:16:18,839 --> 00:16:23,560
comes up afterwards and then we have to

407
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:25,560
kill it in the spring but but um I've

408
00:16:23,559 --> 00:16:27,399
done it when like I for my pumpkins I

409
00:16:25,559 --> 00:16:29,239
usually do it either very late in the

410
00:16:27,399 --> 00:16:31,039
fall or very early in the spring into

411
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:32,639
standing rye and again I don't have a

412
00:16:31,039 --> 00:16:34,000
problem getting through the Rye or

413
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:36,360
seeing the rose when I get ready to

414
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,240
plant killed R it's killed R yeah right

415
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:39,959
so you won't you won't want to try to

416
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:41,360
plant into green Ry well you don't want

417
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:42,879
to plant in anything green if you can

418
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,959
help it that side it'll just it'll make

419
00:16:42,879 --> 00:16:47,240
a mess and it'll ball up and you you've

420
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:50,078
got to kill that crop whatever you plan

421
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:51,919
into make sure it's dead if that if that

422
00:16:50,078 --> 00:16:54,120
zone Builder has a good cutting disc

423
00:16:51,919 --> 00:16:55,919
ahead of that shank you can Zone build

424
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:57,399
through anything but you can't plant

425
00:16:55,919 --> 00:16:58,639
through anything green you want to make

426
00:16:57,399 --> 00:17:00,240
sure everything is dead when when you

427
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:03,639
get there with the

428
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:07,078
planner takes about a month um you want

429
00:17:03,639 --> 00:17:10,558
to spray what I found is 3 weeks to four

430
00:17:07,078 --> 00:17:13,838
weeks before three weeks yeah yeah can

431
00:17:10,558 --> 00:17:16,678
hear me um can we move on to Long Island

432
00:17:13,838 --> 00:17:19,279
any questions for George or

433
00:17:16,679 --> 00:17:21,079
Lynn go ahead go ahead and ask a

434
00:17:19,279 --> 00:17:23,798
question yeah we've got a couple

435
00:17:21,078 --> 00:17:25,838
questions okay what kind of PL what kind

436
00:17:23,798 --> 00:17:30,679
of planter are you

437
00:17:25,838 --> 00:17:33,839
using me yeah John Deere John Deere

438
00:17:30,679 --> 00:17:37,080
7000 same here um I also use a

439
00:17:33,839 --> 00:17:40,279
conventional it's an old uh new idea

440
00:17:37,079 --> 00:17:43,038
transplanter yeah um I use that then I

441
00:17:40,279 --> 00:17:45,759
have a newer style with a uh the finger

442
00:17:43,038 --> 00:17:48,000
pickup uh for the the transplants also

443
00:17:45,759 --> 00:17:49,720
but there's nothing I've done nothing no

444
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,160
modifications to the transplanters we

445
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:54,679
just um if you if you build a clean

446
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:56,400
Mound that's something I failed to

447
00:17:54,679 --> 00:17:58,038
mention earlier too you're going to have

448
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:00,200
seasons where you you may have to go

449
00:17:58,038 --> 00:18:02,400
back over over that where you ripped I I

450
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:04,480
with a two row Ripper I will go through

451
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:06,240
it One Direction if I don't have a nice

452
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:09,360
clean seat bed I will turn around and go

453
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:11,079
back the opposite direction uh at the

454
00:18:09,359 --> 00:18:12,839
same time and that usually does enough

455
00:18:11,079 --> 00:18:14,759
to it breaks up the clouds and clears up

456
00:18:12,839 --> 00:18:17,240
the gives you a nice clean seed bed a

457
00:18:14,759 --> 00:18:19,839
nice mound to plant into um make sure it

458
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:20,839
looks good you want it to look the way

459
00:18:19,839 --> 00:18:22,599
you got to be happy with the way it

460
00:18:20,839 --> 00:18:25,359
looks or you won't be happy with the the

461
00:18:22,599 --> 00:18:26,839
end result so um just make sure you got

462
00:18:25,359 --> 00:18:29,199
a clean place to

463
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:31,240
start any other questions from Long

464
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:33,480
Island yeah I'm just wondering about

465
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:35,798
having a rolling basket followed by a

466
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:37,919
Cula Packer or some of our Growers have

467
00:18:35,798 --> 00:18:40,119
tried two rolling baskets just to have a

468
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:42,120
really good bed and this would be um

469
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:43,918
Zone building in the spring what do you

470
00:18:42,119 --> 00:18:47,399
think of those

471
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:49,000
ideas uh don't see any reason it

472
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:51,120
wouldn't work I've not done that I've

473
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,440
either had the basket or the CER Packer

474
00:18:51,119 --> 00:18:56,558
I haven't had both but I it should be

475
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:58,840
all right I think the key in the if is

476
00:18:56,558 --> 00:19:00,678
to have the CER Packer one place or the

477
00:18:58,839 --> 00:19:01,959
other so you get the firming up of that

478
00:19:00,679 --> 00:19:04,360
row if you're going to do it in the

479
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:06,079
spring you don't have very long for

480
00:19:04,359 --> 00:19:08,639
mother nature to do that for you so you

481
00:19:06,079 --> 00:19:08,639
want to do it

482
00:19:09,519 --> 00:19:14,918
yourself

483
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:14,919
okay to

484
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:22,279
Jeffer I I have like two questions one

485
00:19:18,919 --> 00:19:24,679
is uh there was a comment made that

486
00:19:22,279 --> 00:19:27,759
someone doing the ripping along with the

487
00:19:24,679 --> 00:19:30,240
Zone building after a period of time was

488
00:19:27,759 --> 00:19:33,359
able to not do that ripping anymore how

489
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:35,679
long did it take before you got to that

490
00:19:33,359 --> 00:19:37,240
point I don't know I'm at the point and

491
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:39,600
it's been different each field is

492
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:41,919
different um my heavy ground I still do

493
00:19:39,599 --> 00:19:44,480
the ripping the heavy clay because it

494
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:46,679
just seals up so hard every year but I

495
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:49,519
haven't done any ripping on some grally

496
00:19:46,679 --> 00:19:52,480
LOM around where I live probably for the

497
00:19:49,519 --> 00:19:55,720
last oh I'd say 5 years and I've been

498
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:57,240
doing zone tillage for 15 or 16 years so

499
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:59,720
I probably could have quit quicker the

500
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:01,279
ray rosson when I started tried to tell

501
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:03,038
everybody that you could do it two years

502
00:20:01,279 --> 00:20:04,359
in a row you do your ripping one year

503
00:20:03,038 --> 00:20:05,798
and then you split the middles the

504
00:20:04,359 --> 00:20:07,279
second year and then you don't have to

505
00:20:05,798 --> 00:20:09,240
do it anymore as long as you don't mess

506
00:20:07,279 --> 00:20:10,759
the soil up and you may have been right

507
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:13,038
I don't know I never had nerve enough to

508
00:20:10,759 --> 00:20:15,000
do it that way so I probably went six or

509
00:20:13,038 --> 00:20:16,679
seven or eight years before I quit doing

510
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,640
The Ripping on the good soil but the

511
00:20:16,679 --> 00:20:21,000
heavy clay I still rip every

512
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:23,720
year thank you and then the second

513
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:25,919
question is you have a John Deere 7000

514
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:29,720
do you have a gang of couters in front

515
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:33,000
of each planner row nope I I have a I'm

516
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:36,000
uh up until this year I've had the old

517
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:38,319
unur cart that had a tank and cters on

518
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,119
the cart three cters to the row and pull

519
00:20:38,319 --> 00:20:43,519
the planner behind it this year I'm

520
00:20:40,119 --> 00:20:45,000
going to have a set of uh Trash Wheels

521
00:20:43,519 --> 00:20:48,359
like you saw on that other picture on

522
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:50,279
the front with a single disc fertilizer

523
00:20:48,359 --> 00:20:51,918
applicator off to one side for each row

524
00:20:50,279 --> 00:20:54,240
and I won't use the card anymore I don't

525
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:56,880
need it the cart was needed when I

526
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:59,319
started because if you put the cters on

527
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:00,600
the planter 15 years ago you couldn't

528
00:20:59,319 --> 00:21:03,158
get the planter in the ground the ground

529
00:21:00,599 --> 00:21:05,519
was too hard so I got the cart which you

530
00:21:03,159 --> 00:21:07,480
could put 500 gallons of fertilizer in

531
00:21:05,519 --> 00:21:09,158
or water or whatever for weight and you

532
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:10,440
could get the thing in the ground but

533
00:21:09,159 --> 00:21:12,640
I'm to the point now I don't have any

534
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:15,759
problem anymore so this from now on I

535
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:19,360
won't use the cart I have the same 7,000

536
00:21:15,759 --> 00:21:21,879
planner but it has a a no till cter just

537
00:21:19,359 --> 00:21:24,759
one cter in front of each row uh does a

538
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:28,320
pretty good job I have two neighbors

539
00:21:24,759 --> 00:21:29,798
that have switched to uh Zone till not

540
00:21:28,319 --> 00:21:32,158
if you want to call it that both of them

541
00:21:29,798 --> 00:21:34,079
have kiny Planters and they started with

542
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:36,600
a cter like the one that's in that

543
00:21:34,079 --> 00:21:38,678
picture there the a single cutting cter

544
00:21:36,599 --> 00:21:40,879
in the front no till couter with a

545
00:21:38,679 --> 00:21:42,798
fertilizer unit on and they don't do the

546
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:44,679
Deep ripping anymore they're in the same

547
00:21:42,798 --> 00:21:46,558
shape I'm in uh but they're grain

548
00:21:44,679 --> 00:21:48,080
producers and they have a lot of trouble

549
00:21:46,558 --> 00:21:50,399
with that getting the planter in the

550
00:21:48,079 --> 00:21:52,639
ground so everybody around me has taken

551
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:54,759
the no till couter off and the

552
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:57,440
fertilizer opener they've gone to a

553
00:21:54,759 --> 00:21:59,240
smooth straight slicer disc for the

554
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:01,200
fertilizer opener so that they don't

555
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:02,679
have trouble with those openers holding

556
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:05,240
the planter up out of the

557
00:22:02,679 --> 00:22:07,759
ground great um why don't we move then

558
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:10,120
last to Massachusetts Andy do you have

559
00:22:07,759 --> 00:22:12,079
any questions from Growers at your site

560
00:22:10,119 --> 00:22:13,759
do we have any questions on uh these

561
00:22:12,079 --> 00:22:17,720
folks equipment

562
00:22:13,759 --> 00:22:20,400
situation let me uh hand off the mic

563
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:23,440
here uh I think it was George who said

564
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:25,278
he only goes 13 inches deep is that

565
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:27,679
really adequate to get the plow pan on

566
00:22:25,278 --> 00:22:30,880
your Fields because here our Fields have

567
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:33,480
been farmed about 350 years and packed

568
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:37,840
continually and I have to go down 17 or

569
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:40,960
18 in to get below it wow okay what I

570
00:22:37,839 --> 00:22:42,918
was talking about was that two Row one

571
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:45,038
that I built for my strawberries there's

572
00:22:42,919 --> 00:22:47,320
no compaction layers in that field cuz

573
00:22:45,038 --> 00:22:50,200
I've zoned tilled for years so I go down

574
00:22:47,319 --> 00:22:52,278
12 or 13 in when I plant strawberries

575
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:54,120
the big machine that's the regular under

576
00:22:52,278 --> 00:22:57,480
Earth for planting soybeans or sweet

577
00:22:54,119 --> 00:23:00,079
corn or pumpkins I go about 17 or 18 in

578
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:01,919
if in the clay in the fields where I

579
00:23:00,079 --> 00:23:04,119
have done it a number of years and I

580
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:06,400
don't have any compaction anymore again

581
00:23:04,119 --> 00:23:07,879
I still only go 10 or 12 in there's no

582
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:09,600
reason to go any deeper if you don't

583
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:11,400
have a density layer and it pulls a heck

584
00:23:09,599 --> 00:23:13,918
of a lot easier 10 in deep than it does

585
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:15,679
18 so once you've done it a few years

586
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:17,120
you can quit going so deep if you don't

587
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:18,519
mess it up and go back in there with a

588
00:23:17,119 --> 00:23:21,918
plow or disc or something and put a

589
00:23:18,519 --> 00:23:24,480
layer back in you need to measure your

590
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:28,278
compat right penetrometer you need a

591
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:31,558
penetrometer or a a tile rod or

592
00:23:28,278 --> 00:23:34,558
something so you can detect where your

593
00:23:31,558 --> 00:23:36,599
compaction layer is so you can rip just

594
00:23:34,558 --> 00:23:40,119
a little deeper

595
00:23:36,599 --> 00:23:42,599
right which is I check every

596
00:23:40,119 --> 00:23:45,839
field um uh is there any other questions

597
00:23:42,599 --> 00:23:48,798
there I'm sorry any other questions

598
00:23:45,839 --> 00:23:50,639
here looks like that's it okay great

599
00:23:48,798 --> 00:23:53,200
Lynn um I'm sorry I cut you off you had

600
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:55,320
a comment no I just start to say I I

601
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:57,440
check every field um I go around once or

602
00:23:55,319 --> 00:23:59,720
twice and I jump off and uh take the

603
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:01,640
penetr and I'll check in the rip and

604
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:03,960
make sure I'm I'm breaking through the

605
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:05,880
hard Pan um then that's how I determine

606
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:07,120
how deep I have to go in each field so

607
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:09,440
most of the time I just run it all the

608
00:24:07,119 --> 00:24:11,158
way down but um you can tell I just kind

609
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:13,159
of listen to the Tractor you can some

610
00:24:11,159 --> 00:24:14,880
Fields you can you can tell it's pulling

611
00:24:13,159 --> 00:24:16,080
a lot easier I'll just jump off and

612
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:17,440
check in if I don't have to run it as

613
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:21,839
deep I will tend to pick it up a little

614
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:23,880
bit and uh do it that way so great um

615
00:24:21,839 --> 00:24:27,879
all right I think what we want to do is

616
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:28,760
um uh we' got one more question can we f

617
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:31,320
go

618
00:24:28,759 --> 00:24:32,960
ahead Yes actually I have two questions

619
00:24:31,319 --> 00:24:35,359
one question would

620
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:36,960
be assuming it's dry enough in the

621
00:24:35,359 --> 00:24:38,798
spring is there any good reason not to

622
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:40,720
do the no tillage preparation in the

623
00:24:38,798 --> 00:24:44,240
spring because conventionally on Long

624
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:46,360
Island we have Sandy loyal uh LOM soils

625
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:49,038
if we do feeli preparation the season

626
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:51,398
before in the fall we have wind and or

627
00:24:49,038 --> 00:24:51,398
water

628
00:24:52,079 --> 00:24:58,519
erosion I I do all of mine in the spring

629
00:24:55,159 --> 00:25:01,120
um I cover crop with Rye on all just

630
00:24:58,519 --> 00:25:02,960
about all of my ground um and again like

631
00:25:01,119 --> 00:25:04,398
I said three weeks to four weeks before

632
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:06,240
I'm going to rip I'll go through and

633
00:25:04,398 --> 00:25:10,119
spray with Roundup and then go back

634
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:11,599
through um and and do my my tillage and

635
00:25:10,119 --> 00:25:13,839
that that seems it's been a pretty good

636
00:25:11,599 --> 00:25:15,759
combination for me so I don't have a

637
00:25:13,839 --> 00:25:18,639
problem with spring as long as you can

638
00:25:15,759 --> 00:25:20,319
do the ripping two or three weeks ahead

639
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:22,278
of when you're going to plant to let

640
00:25:20,319 --> 00:25:24,319
that row get healed up and if you put

641
00:25:22,278 --> 00:25:26,398
the CER Packer on the back you'll do a

642
00:25:24,319 --> 00:25:28,158
little better job the problem is that

643
00:25:26,398 --> 00:25:30,599
slot will stay open and you'll have

644
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:32,520
loose soil for a while for a short

645
00:25:30,599 --> 00:25:34,558
period after you do it until you get a

646
00:25:32,519 --> 00:25:36,960
heavy rain or until it just naturally

647
00:25:34,558 --> 00:25:38,879
settles in so I don't like it in the

648
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:40,159
spring if you got to do it with right

649
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:42,159
away and then try to plant right

650
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:44,559
afterwards we had a trial in Wayne

651
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:46,640
County uh with Mike stanard some years

652
00:25:44,558 --> 00:25:48,119
ago on beans and the guy ripped today

653
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:49,919
and he planted the beans tomorrow and

654
00:25:48,119 --> 00:25:51,959
they were terrible because he's planting

655
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:54,120
beans in a 1inch wide slot that's

656
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:56,399
nothing but a big air pocket you have to

657
00:25:54,119 --> 00:25:58,558
either do it in the fall or do it far

658
00:25:56,398 --> 00:26:02,678
enough ahead in the spring so it heals

659
00:25:58,558 --> 00:26:06,558
up all righty um let's oh can we um hit

660
00:26:02,679 --> 00:26:08,960
our mutes thank you um I think it do we

661
00:26:06,558 --> 00:26:11,798
have do we have Thomas on I don't see

662
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:14,120
him on yet okay all right so we wanted

663
00:26:11,798 --> 00:26:15,879
to move to uh Long Island because we had

664
00:26:14,119 --> 00:26:17,678
a Growers that were using some slightly

665
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:22,440
different uh some different equipment

666
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:27,240
there um and uh so do we have Jen

667
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:29,480
and yeah we're here Anu okay um so I did

668
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:32,839
make um I did put all of the pictures

669
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:34,679
for Jen's setup um on a PowerPoint and I

670
00:26:32,839 --> 00:26:36,879
think Betsy sent that out this

671
00:26:34,679 --> 00:26:40,200
morning um I will put it up on our

672
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:40,200
screen as well so you can all see

673
00:26:42,278 --> 00:26:47,359
it so go ahead

674
00:26:45,159 --> 00:26:50,080
Jen I'm just waiting for the picture so

675
00:26:47,359 --> 00:26:50,079
I know what I'm talking

676
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:57,679
about hi this is Thomas I am

677
00:26:55,359 --> 00:27:01,038
connected oh okay Thomas we'll be right

678
00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:03,000
right with you okay I didn't see that is

679
00:27:01,038 --> 00:27:05,640
a uh no till grain drill that we

680
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:08,480
purchased the sunflower 7t

681
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:12,799
wide um 7 and 1/2 foot wide so that we

682
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:14,919
can no till cover crops into the fields

683
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:17,839
that we are resting for a year we grow

684
00:27:14,919 --> 00:27:20,200
pumpkins specifically one year at rest

685
00:27:17,839 --> 00:27:23,439
one year is in pumpkins and one of our

686
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:25,159
biggest problems is fyora and keeping it

687
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:28,399
away because we don't have enough ground

688
00:27:25,159 --> 00:27:31,520
to rotate in so we're trying to build up

689
00:27:28,398 --> 00:27:33,879
the soil um to protect itself against

690
00:27:31,519 --> 00:27:36,839
the phyas so the noil drill is given us

691
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:40,600
some options to try other cover crops

692
00:27:36,839 --> 00:27:43,519
this past year we tried um oats and

693
00:27:40,599 --> 00:27:45,959
Alfalfa uh that's it going down the

694
00:27:43,519 --> 00:27:49,240
field um so you can see that it it does

695
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:51,720
a nice job in in the field without

696
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:55,038
tillage um we also used it to plant

697
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:57,519
sorghum Sudan grass and third we planted

698
00:27:55,038 --> 00:27:59,519
our Rye in the fall um which is about

699
00:27:57,519 --> 00:28:01,359
about three bushels to the acre and then

700
00:27:59,519 --> 00:28:05,359
we use the Rye in the

701
00:28:01,359 --> 00:28:05,359
springtime as the mulch for the

702
00:28:06,919 --> 00:28:13,840
pumpkins that is our Zone Builder that

703
00:28:10,599 --> 00:28:16,558
was earlier in the season when we were

704
00:28:13,839 --> 00:28:19,720
just testing it out and we had what

705
00:28:16,558 --> 00:28:21,759
they're called the shark tooth reduced

706
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:24,839
um residue managers and there in the

707
00:28:21,759 --> 00:28:27,079
front of the couter and then we also had

708
00:28:24,839 --> 00:28:28,000
shark tooth behind the couter and we

709
00:28:27,079 --> 00:28:31,319
found

710
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:33,640
we had about four bushel of Rye to the

711
00:28:31,319 --> 00:28:36,439
acre this past year so there was a lot

712
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:38,240
of residue on the field and we found

713
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:40,679
that the even the two sets of shark

714
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:42,960
teeth residue managers were not clearing

715
00:28:40,679 --> 00:28:44,880
enough to make a nice zone so what we

716
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:47,278
did was we got more aggressive residue

717
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:48,720
managers behind the couter and there

718
00:28:47,278 --> 00:28:50,759
should be another

719
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:53,240
picture that might be the one I can't

720
00:28:50,759 --> 00:28:53,240
really see it

721
00:28:54,839 --> 00:28:58,678
well and that's it yeah that's right

722
00:28:57,240 --> 00:29:01,038
that was earlier in the season there

723
00:28:58,679 --> 00:29:03,320
that's the two shark teeth and right

724
00:29:01,038 --> 00:29:05,440
there there's hardly any residue but the

725
00:29:03,319 --> 00:29:08,319
pictures previous that's where we had a

726
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:11,840
ton of residue so we found that putting

727
00:29:08,319 --> 00:29:14,720
the um more aggressive residue managers

728
00:29:11,839 --> 00:29:16,879
behind the cter really helped push more

729
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:19,440
of the Ry

730
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:22,600
away this was our first year using this

731
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:24,679
Zone Builder um originally we've used a

732
00:29:22,599 --> 00:29:27,879
water wheel transplanter to transplant

733
00:29:24,679 --> 00:29:30,000
our pumpkins directly into the dry and

734
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:31,600
we were noticing that they weren't there

735
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:34,038
wasn't as good of a stand they weren't

736
00:29:31,599 --> 00:29:36,599
growing as well and we knew that they

737
00:29:34,038 --> 00:29:39,599
needed more and this Zone built up a

738
00:29:36,599 --> 00:29:42,319
nice 8 in zone where with fluffy soil

739
00:29:39,599 --> 00:29:44,798
and they grew very well um we just need

740
00:29:42,319 --> 00:29:46,439
some more time to perfect it those are

741
00:29:44,798 --> 00:29:50,200
some of the strips that you can see that

742
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:52,200
we prepared and um it made a nice little

743
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:54,840
Zone there and you can see the amount of

744
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:56,798
residue in between and there's a lot of

745
00:29:54,839 --> 00:29:58,519
residue there even with all of that

746
00:29:56,798 --> 00:30:00,319
residue though we had some trouble with

747
00:29:58,519 --> 00:30:04,200
weeds so that's one of the questions

748
00:30:00,319 --> 00:30:06,759
that we have is weed management and also

749
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:10,558
with that is also the and there's the

750
00:30:06,759 --> 00:30:13,440
pumpkins and we put um tea tape down so

751
00:30:10,558 --> 00:30:16,158
that we can water and also fertig with

752
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:18,320
and another one of our questions is

753
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:21,519
fertilizer inside this

754
00:30:18,319 --> 00:30:23,439
Zone and is it being is are the weeds

755
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:25,880
taking away from the fertilizer and how

756
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:27,919
we can compete with the weeds so there's

757
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:29,799
two issues in here it's the taking care

758
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:32,200
of the weeds and also knowing if if we

759
00:30:29,798 --> 00:30:35,319
need to do something different with our

760
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:37,159
fertilizer at this point in time we have

761
00:30:35,319 --> 00:30:39,278
purchased a John Deere planter a pea

762
00:30:37,159 --> 00:30:41,880
planter corn planter that we would like

763
00:30:39,278 --> 00:30:44,119
to try seeding the pumpkins in the

764
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:46,039
ground rather than transplant planning

765
00:30:44,119 --> 00:30:48,278
because it would take a lot less time

766
00:30:46,038 --> 00:30:48,278
and

767
00:30:48,679 --> 00:30:53,840
labor I don't know if there's any other

768
00:30:51,119 --> 00:30:55,439
question how did you manage the Rye when

769
00:30:53,839 --> 00:30:57,480
you got lot you said you got a lot of

770
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:58,919
Rye there how did you when did you cut

771
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:01,319
it at what stage did you cut it and how

772
00:30:58,919 --> 00:31:03,799
did you get it that that manageable

773
00:31:01,319 --> 00:31:05,278
we've tried several different we've

774
00:31:03,798 --> 00:31:08,200
tried cutting it tall we've tried

775
00:31:05,278 --> 00:31:10,398
cutting it short we have a flail Chopper

776
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:12,200
that we've used um we've had difficulty

777
00:31:10,398 --> 00:31:15,119
with that when it's got too gotten Too

778
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:16,519
Tall so we use a ro rotary rotary mower

779
00:31:15,119 --> 00:31:18,599
we'll cut it down and we'll go through

780
00:31:16,519 --> 00:31:21,519
and fluff it up again um what we're

781
00:31:18,599 --> 00:31:23,240
really interested in is rolling we had

782
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:25,960
just a roller that we used to roll our

783
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:27,919
lawn and we tried rolling some of the

784
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:29,600
the Rye and that seemed to but we found

785
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:31,320
that you can't go in the same direction

786
00:31:29,599 --> 00:31:33,199
that you are with the Zone Builder

787
00:31:31,319 --> 00:31:34,599
otherwise that ride just wraps right up

788
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:36,759
so we're considering trying this year

789
00:31:34,599 --> 00:31:39,079
going Crossways and so we didn't know if

790
00:31:36,759 --> 00:31:41,119
anybody had any um experience with the

791
00:31:39,079 --> 00:31:43,558
rollers because there are rollers

792
00:31:41,119 --> 00:31:44,918
available that we've seen on the front

793
00:31:43,558 --> 00:31:46,798
of tractors right in front of their

794
00:31:44,919 --> 00:31:48,320
planter and they go through and roll and

795
00:31:46,798 --> 00:31:51,278
plant right at the same time so we're

796
00:31:48,319 --> 00:31:53,519
interested in that as well we've rolled

797
00:31:51,278 --> 00:31:54,880
high ride with a color Packer and then

798
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:57,679
planted right in

799
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:59,880
it pumpkins came up but we had problems

800
00:31:57,679 --> 00:31:59,880
with

801
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:06,960
fertility oh sorry about that um Jen uh

802
00:32:05,599 --> 00:32:08,879
I wanted to see if there was any

803
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:10,720
questions any of the questions from

804
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:12,600
Massachusetts from any of the Growers

805
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:15,159
there with the

806
00:32:12,599 --> 00:32:18,759
system um we have one here hold

807
00:32:15,159 --> 00:32:18,760
on this is Wally

808
00:32:19,398 --> 00:32:24,359
zakowski we try and plant in as big a Ry

809
00:32:22,079 --> 00:32:25,960
as possible but we don't cultipack it or

810
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:28,240
roll it or anything we just spray it

811
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:31,880
with Roundup it's usually in the head

812
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:33,679
stage when we do it and uh sometimes it

813
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:35,639
works and sometimes it doesn't it has to

814
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:37,759
be really really dry when we're working

815
00:32:35,638 --> 00:32:41,240
it though so you don't tangle up when

816
00:32:37,759 --> 00:32:42,558
it's wet it's like wire um I don't know

817
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:46,038
what's the advantage to knock going to

818
00:32:42,558 --> 00:32:46,038
ride down that's what I don't

819
00:32:47,759 --> 00:32:53,679
understand can you answer

820
00:32:51,398 --> 00:32:56,319
that yeah I can answer it but give me a

821
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:57,880
half a day to think about it my

822
00:32:56,319 --> 00:32:59,960
understanding is if you Let It Drop and

823
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:02,320
I've heard that from Steve gr that it it

824
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:03,639
falls in various directions and so it's

825
00:33:02,319 --> 00:33:06,638
harder to plant

826
00:33:03,638 --> 00:33:08,918
into so we've what we've done is we roll

827
00:33:06,638 --> 00:33:12,038
and then we hit it with Roundup and

828
00:33:08,919 --> 00:33:12,038
that's just to keep the drift

829
00:33:12,558 --> 00:33:18,200
down I don't think you could run a Zone

830
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:21,278
Builder through large dry so if you're

831
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:22,278
looking to build a zone that might be a

832
00:33:21,278 --> 00:33:25,159
a

833
00:33:22,278 --> 00:33:28,720
problem the person from Yeta that we

834
00:33:25,159 --> 00:33:31,519
talked with uh used the

835
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:33,200
analogy you you couldn't comb your hair

836
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:37,200
if one end wasn't

837
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:41,278
fastened and so rolling it down gives Z

838
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:44,679
more of an opportunity to

839
00:33:41,278 --> 00:33:46,200
work I wonder if you could kill the Roy

840
00:33:44,679 --> 00:33:48,679
when it's standing and go through the

841
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:50,840
Zone Builder when it's standing without

842
00:33:48,679 --> 00:33:52,278
knocking it down cuz then you don't get

843
00:33:50,839 --> 00:33:54,918
that once you knock it down even if you

844
00:33:52,278 --> 00:33:56,319
go straight you still get that it's not

845
00:33:54,919 --> 00:33:58,320
perfectly straight you still get that

846
00:33:56,319 --> 00:33:59,918
mixing you know

847
00:33:58,319 --> 00:34:01,200
and if it's but if it's standing you're

848
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:03,639
not going to get that

849
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:05,798
mixing it's upright you might be able to

850
00:34:03,638 --> 00:34:08,039
go through with the machine and make a

851
00:34:05,798 --> 00:34:10,519
and make your

852
00:34:08,039 --> 00:34:14,398
Zone what about after with a planter

853
00:34:10,519 --> 00:34:16,838
though the after the cedar or the

854
00:34:14,398 --> 00:34:18,279
transplanter cedar cedar would go right

855
00:34:16,838 --> 00:34:19,519
through it cuz you're not going to so

856
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:22,159
why don't we do we have any other

857
00:34:19,519 --> 00:34:22,159
questions from

858
00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:28,079
Massachusetts especially this if you're

859
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:30,119
not going to knock knock the dry down

860
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:33,399
doesn't that affect the light light

861
00:34:30,119 --> 00:34:33,399
getting to the crop of

862
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:38,800
pumpkins it knocks down when you plant

863
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,599
it guys when you run the wheels of the

864
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:42,919
tractor will run it over and it'll knock

865
00:34:40,599 --> 00:34:46,159
most of it down you're better off we

866
00:34:42,918 --> 00:34:47,759
found George does it and I do it too go

867
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:49,838
leave it standing and go through that

868
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:52,639
way let the wheels of the tractor knock

869
00:34:49,838 --> 00:34:55,119
it down both between your deep tillage

870
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:57,838
and your planning um it opens it up it

871
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:59,519
knocks probably 85 90% of it down then

872
00:34:57,838 --> 00:35:02,199
the rest Falls within a couple weeks it

873
00:34:59,519 --> 00:35:04,679
it'll fall down um it looks good after

874
00:35:02,199 --> 00:35:07,000
you've finished if it's really dead the

875
00:35:04,679 --> 00:35:09,440
cold through cut the qu the key is you

876
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:11,159
got to get the round up on the gry far

877
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:13,920
enough ahead so it's dead when you go to

878
00:35:11,159 --> 00:35:15,559
plant it and I agree with Lyn I think I

879
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:17,320
can get through it with a Zone Builder

880
00:35:15,559 --> 00:35:19,480
and the planner much better if I haven't

881
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:21,640
rolled it the one year that I did try

882
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:23,358
rolling it that it got too big you have

883
00:35:21,639 --> 00:35:25,279
to go the same way with the roller you

884
00:35:23,358 --> 00:35:27,559
can't go backwards or it all balls up

885
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:29,119
and I can't roll my field precisely

886
00:35:27,559 --> 00:35:31,199
enough to know exactly where my planter

887
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:33,240
is going to go so I had big trouble that

888
00:35:31,199 --> 00:35:36,000
year if you just kill it when it's about

889
00:35:33,239 --> 00:35:38,118
24 inches tall or 30 Ines high and let

890
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,358
it fall down and you've done it three

891
00:35:38,119 --> 00:35:40,960
weeks before you're going to plant

892
00:35:39,358 --> 00:35:42,559
pumpkins your planter won't have and the

893
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:44,559
Deep taer won't have any trouble going

894
00:35:42,559 --> 00:35:46,039
through there yeah and it even if you go

895
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:47,639
the same direction it still tends to

896
00:35:46,039 --> 00:35:50,679
wind up on the on the wheels of the

897
00:35:47,639 --> 00:35:51,838
planter y um I found it's far better to

898
00:35:50,679 --> 00:35:54,519
just leave it standing when you go

899
00:35:51,838 --> 00:35:56,078
through it and um it it doesn't seem to

900
00:35:54,519 --> 00:35:58,318
ball up at all once in a while you get

901
00:35:56,079 --> 00:36:00,480
some but for the most part it'll it

902
00:35:58,318 --> 00:36:01,920
won't plug your wheels up and you don't

903
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:03,480
have to get back and chop that stuff out

904
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:07,358
of

905
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:09,440
there great thanks Lynn um uh because we

906
00:36:07,358 --> 00:36:11,679
are behind schedule I'm going to ask

907
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:14,639
folks to hold their questions for Jen

908
00:36:11,679 --> 00:36:14,639
and we'll come back to
