1
00:00:01,159 --> 00:00:04,799
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:08,199 --> 00:00:14,000
University okay so I think after a long

3
00:00:10,638 --> 00:00:17,118
day now it's U it's time for me I guess

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,399
to uh Entertain You for the next hour or

5
00:00:17,118 --> 00:00:23,480
so and um try to keep you awake and and

6
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:26,678
what I thought what I should do is um uh

7
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:30,160
share and discuss with you uh our more

8
00:00:26,678 --> 00:00:33,640
recent work on uh microbal Association

9
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:36,840
with healthy plants and also proposed

10
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:40,878
functions of these uh

11
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:44,359
microbes now um since this is very much

12
00:00:40,878 --> 00:00:45,558
a an emerging research field I thought

13
00:00:44,359 --> 00:00:46,920
you know it would be appropriate to give

14
00:00:45,558 --> 00:00:50,399
a brief

15
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:52,198
introduction and um so personally I

16
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,640
believe that really one of the more

17
00:00:52,198 --> 00:00:57,000
profound discoveries in molecular plant

18
00:00:54,640 --> 00:01:00,039
microb interactions during the last

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,079
decade has been the observation that

20
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:04,680
healthy asymptomatic plants in nature

21
00:01:03,079 --> 00:01:07,118
live in association with a rich

22
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:09,720
diversity of microorganisms and in

23
00:01:07,118 --> 00:01:12,319
simple terms the sum of the

24
00:01:09,719 --> 00:01:14,640
microorganisms that live in association

25
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:18,118
that colonize a healthy asymptomatic

26
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:20,879
plants that's what called the plant

27
00:01:18,118 --> 00:01:22,920
microbal and it's important that really

28
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:24,920
for Association of healthy plants with

29
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:27,640
microbes that we see association with

30
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:30,400
different microbial classes so we see

31
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:32,799
for example association with bacteria we

32
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:35,000
have association with protes and we have

33
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:37,240
also associations with

34
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:41,078
fungi and

35
00:01:37,239 --> 00:01:44,118
um the microbes that live in association

36
00:01:41,078 --> 00:01:46,919
with above ground plants uh that's often

37
00:01:44,118 --> 00:01:48,640
called the phosphere and uh the microbes

38
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:50,920
that live in association with below

39
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:53,478
ground Parts particular the root uh this

40
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:54,879
is called the risos spere now what I

41
00:01:53,478 --> 00:01:57,359
thought what would be useful to

42
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:59,438
structure my presentation today what

43
00:01:57,359 --> 00:02:01,759
I'll do is in the first part of my

44
00:01:59,438 --> 00:02:05,599
lecture I will uh tell you what we've

45
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:08,919
learned about the bacterial um plant

46
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:11,878
microbot and then during the last maybe

47
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:14,719
10 15 minutes I'll tell you some uh

48
00:02:11,878 --> 00:02:16,959
recent findings of uh association

49
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:19,878
between healthy plants and root

50
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:21,360
Associated fungi I thought this might be

51
00:02:19,878 --> 00:02:23,159
interesting so let's get started with

52
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:26,360
the bacterial root

53
00:02:23,159 --> 00:02:29,318
microbot um it's I think it's now um

54
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:32,239
widely accepted that essentially all

55
00:02:29,318 --> 00:02:34,799
flowering plants in nature are densely

56
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:37,000
colonized by by bacteria healthy

57
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:39,120
asymptomatic plants and literally

58
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,239
millions of bacteria colonize the leaf

59
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,319
surface and the interior and it's very

60
00:02:41,239 --> 00:02:45,039
similar to The Roots we we find zillions

61
00:02:43,318 --> 00:02:47,560
of bacteria that colonize the root

62
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:50,318
surface and also the root interior what

63
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:52,439
is slightly more controversial is the

64
00:02:50,318 --> 00:02:54,639
source of inoculum of these Leaf

65
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:58,439
Associated bacteria because leaves you

66
00:02:54,639 --> 00:03:01,039
know they thrive in a in a natural open

67
00:02:58,439 --> 00:03:02,919
environment and and and it's very clear

68
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:04,759
that there are multiple sources for

69
00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:08,280
these Leaf Associated microbes but this

70
00:03:04,759 --> 00:03:11,359
is quite different um from the root from

71
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:14,598
uh the root microbot it's it's now also

72
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:17,519
I think widely accepted that um bacteria

73
00:03:14,598 --> 00:03:19,719
that live in unplanted soil that those

74
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:21,920
bacteria defines the bacterial St in

75
00:03:19,719 --> 00:03:24,120
ulum for the formation of the root

76
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:26,199
microbot and that has some experimental

77
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:27,840
advantages that I will explain to you

78
00:03:26,199 --> 00:03:30,399
later during my

79
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,840
presentation so what are proposed

80
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:35,560
microbot functions for the plant hose

81
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:37,360
there are a number of them and um these

82
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:39,680
include nutrient mobilization there's

83
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:42,239
certainly strong evidence that many uh

84
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:45,239
root Associated bacteria help plants to

85
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:49,200
mobilize uh nutrients for plant growth

86
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:51,599
so plant growth promotion is has been um

87
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:53,839
repeatedly reported there's evidence for

88
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:56,798
IND indirect pathogen protection and I

89
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:58,598
will report on that as well aoic stress

90
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:00,438
tolerance and increased Fitness so it's

91
00:03:58,598 --> 00:04:02,759
almost too good to believe and one has

92
00:04:00,438 --> 00:04:04,280
to be really skeptical because many of

93
00:04:02,759 --> 00:04:06,518
these claims are anecdotal and

94
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:09,919
importantly many of these claims are

95
00:04:06,519 --> 00:04:13,280
based on monoassociation so one microb

96
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:15,759
member plus one host under a laboratory

97
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:18,238
conditions but the the community context

98
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:21,439
is frequently missing so one needs to

99
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:24,439
really um take these claims uh with a

100
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:25,918
grain of salt so these are our long-term

101
00:04:24,439 --> 00:04:27,680
questions that we would like to address

102
00:04:25,918 --> 00:04:29,918
for our work how can healthy plants

103
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:32,319
establish intimate associations with

104
00:04:29,918 --> 00:04:34,319
microbial communities how can plants

105
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:36,079
discriminate between beneficial and

106
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:38,639
pathogenic microbes I think this not

107
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:40,599
understood and and and lastly how do

108
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:42,280
plant Associated microbic communities

109
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:46,080
promote plant health so this is really

110
00:04:42,279 --> 00:04:48,879
what guides our our research

111
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:52,240
activities now let's have a closer look

112
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:54,879
into the root Associated bacteria it's

113
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,759
known actually since more than 100 years

114
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:58,319
that's Roots growing in natural soil

115
00:04:56,759 --> 00:05:01,360
live an intimate association with a

116
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:04,000
diverse range of soil born bacteria and

117
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:06,400
I think there's some evidence now that

118
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,720
um it's really organic compounds that

119
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:12,198
are actively exuded by Roots into soil

120
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:15,720
that those serve as chemical cues and

121
00:05:12,199 --> 00:05:17,360
attract soil born bacteria many of these

122
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:19,440
bacteria then become enriched on the

123
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,439
root surface and some of them also make

124
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:23,839
it inside the root so they are bacterial

125
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:25,600
root endophytes now there are two

126
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:28,198
numbers that I would like you to keep in

127
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:31,800
mind and the first number is really that

128
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:35,120
soil so unplanted soil uh is an

129
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:38,280
incredibly Rich compartment on this

130
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:40,800
globe for bacteria um and one gram of

131
00:05:38,279 --> 00:05:42,638
soil contains between 10 to the 7 to 10

132
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,759
to the N bacteria so this is very

133
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:48,400
important so essentially roots are

134
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:50,960
growing in a bacterial broth this is um

135
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:54,239
it's it's really a remarkable um

136
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:58,159
observation the the second um important

137
00:05:54,240 --> 00:06:00,240
number is that about 10 to 20% of um

138
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,919
carbon dioxide atmosph Eric carbon

139
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:05,319
dioxide that is fixed via the Kelvin

140
00:06:01,918 --> 00:06:08,159
benenson cycle in green leaves is ex is

141
00:06:05,319 --> 00:06:10,720
extruded as organic carbon vir Roots

142
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:13,400
into soil so there's substantial organic

143
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:16,000
carbon sequestration by plants into soil

144
00:06:13,399 --> 00:06:19,038
and you ask OS why why do plants invest

145
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,800
so much energy into soil now

146
00:06:19,038 --> 00:06:24,360
conceptually I think um the root is

147
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:28,240
analogous to the digestive tract of of

148
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:29,879
of vertebrates and you may ask why um I

149
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:32,038
think the arguments for this is both

150
00:06:29,879 --> 00:06:34,680
organs the the digestive tract as well

151
00:06:32,038 --> 00:06:36,719
as roots are organs that are dedicated

152
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:39,439
for nutrient mobilization and nutrient

153
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:41,280
uptake the the difference is between the

154
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:43,279
two system this is a closed system this

155
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:44,799
is an open system and essentially you

156
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:46,439
can look at a root you know as a

157
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,639
digestive tract where the inside is

158
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:50,399
turned out and I will come back to that

159
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:54,280
in a

160
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:57,318
minute so um then I thought it might be

161
00:06:54,279 --> 00:07:00,359
useful if this works to briefly explain

162
00:06:57,319 --> 00:07:02,240
to you how do we measure these root

163
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:04,319
Associated bacterial communities and

164
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:06,240
this in a cartoon explains the

165
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:07,960
fractionation of the arabidopsis root

166
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:10,160
Associated bacterial microb AO which is

167
00:07:07,959 --> 00:07:12,719
now more or less a standard protocol so

168
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:15,400
what we do is we grow our arabidopsis

169
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:17,120
plants in natural soil but in otherwise

170
00:07:15,399 --> 00:07:19,279
controlled environmental conditions in

171
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:22,199
the greenhouse we grow them to bolting

172
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:25,038
stage then we Harvest about three uh 3

173
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:27,080
cm long segments of arabidopsis roots we

174
00:07:25,038 --> 00:07:28,800
wash the roots and collect the soil

175
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:30,719
particles that physically adhere to the

176
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:33,160
root surface and this is then what we

177
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:35,199
call the risos spere compartment and

178
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:38,560
subsequent to the washing we apply a

179
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:41,560
sonication step to deplete remaining

180
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:43,918
epithetic bacteria from the um root

181
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:46,839
surface and then we end up with these um

182
00:07:43,918 --> 00:07:48,519
washed and sonicated Roots we homogenize

183
00:07:46,839 --> 00:07:50,918
the roots to release bacteria that

184
00:07:48,519 --> 00:07:53,198
thrive inside roots and this is then

185
00:07:50,918 --> 00:07:55,560
what we call the root compartment and

186
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:57,158
then in a subsequent step we compare the

187
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:58,759
bacterial communities in the root

188
00:07:57,158 --> 00:08:00,918
compartment with the bacterial

189
00:07:58,759 --> 00:08:02,400
communities in the isosphere compartment

190
00:08:00,918 --> 00:08:04,918
and as a control the bacterial

191
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:08,239
communities present in unplanted natural

192
00:08:04,918 --> 00:08:09,240
soil right so it's very simple so how do

193
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,720
you

194
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:14,879
molecularly characterize these spectal

195
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:17,199
communities we and essentially most

196
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:20,280
other groups in microbial ecology use

197
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:22,560
the bacterial 6 in srna gene uh it's

198
00:08:20,279 --> 00:08:24,799
really the most widely used DNA sequence

199
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:27,639
for taxonomic assignments of bacteria

200
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:30,680
it's technically a relatively simple um

201
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:33,360
experiment you just use various PCR

202
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:35,839
primer combinations to amplify segments

203
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:38,360
of this bacterial 6 ands ribosomal RNA

204
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:40,479
genes and then the PCR amplicons are

205
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:42,399
subjected to pyro aluminous sequencing

206
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:45,278
so that's you know it's it's relatively

207
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:48,000
standard uh what becomes important is

208
00:08:45,278 --> 00:08:50,240
the uh computational or the the

209
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,000
bioinformatic processing of these 6ins

210
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:55,560
sequences and so for this um we

211
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,958
developed a customized pipeline uh we

212
00:08:55,559 --> 00:08:59,518
use at least 10,000 high quality reads

213
00:08:57,958 --> 00:09:01,039
per sample then in the first step

214
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:03,399
there's a read alignment and this is

215
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:05,639
perhaps the most critical step which is

216
00:09:03,399 --> 00:09:08,639
called complete linkage clustering where

217
00:09:05,639 --> 00:09:12,278
all of the um six and srna sequences

218
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:14,199
that share greater than 97% identity are

219
00:09:12,278 --> 00:09:16,439
used for the definition of a strange

220
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:19,839
term which is called an operational

221
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:22,399
taxonomic unit so bacterial otu and to

222
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:25,480
give you an idea of the taxonomic of the

223
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:27,278
resolution power of these otus this is

224
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:28,800
roughly between the bacterial genos and

225
00:09:27,278 --> 00:09:30,200
a bacterial species so it's very

226
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:33,240
important to keep in mind this

227
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:35,399
technology fails to discriminate between

228
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:38,000
different strains of one and the same

229
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:40,278
species but it can resolve in the best

230
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,200
cases different bacterial species and

231
00:09:40,278 --> 00:09:45,078
then you get two types of information if

232
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:48,040
you examine a compartment you can Define

233
00:09:45,078 --> 00:09:50,000
the number of different otus and you

234
00:09:48,039 --> 00:09:51,480
also obtain the relative abundance so

235
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,879
you know which one is abundant which one

236
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:56,639
is a rare one and those two informations

237
00:09:53,879 --> 00:09:59,559
are then used for um multivariate

238
00:09:56,639 --> 00:10:04,399
statistic uh analysis

239
00:09:59,559 --> 00:10:06,639
so why don't we have a look into um our

240
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:09,559
early work that was published now some

241
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:11,078
time ago where our goal was to

242
00:10:09,559 --> 00:10:13,119
characterize the structure of the

243
00:10:11,078 --> 00:10:15,239
arabidopsis root microbot and for this

244
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:17,480
purpose we've grown our plants in

245
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:20,278
natural soils but under controlled

246
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:23,360
environmental conditions and then we've

247
00:10:20,278 --> 00:10:25,480
compared um the root Associated uh

248
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:27,720
bacteria with the bacterial communities

249
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:30,360
in the risos spere compartment and in

250
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:32,278
the unplanted soil and this is typically

251
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:34,600
how we visualize these results it's a

252
00:10:32,278 --> 00:10:38,360
Turner plot and I need to explain to you

253
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:42,200
how to read uh uh these uh these plots

254
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:45,200
each dot represents an bacterial otu as

255
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:48,079
defined by six as sequence tag and the

256
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:50,160
size uh indicates the relative abundance

257
00:10:48,078 --> 00:10:51,919
so let's say large dots represents

258
00:10:50,159 --> 00:10:54,078
abundant bacteria small dots low

259
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:56,559
abundance bacteria more important is the

260
00:10:54,078 --> 00:10:58,879
position within this triangle because

261
00:10:56,559 --> 00:11:02,439
the the position of a particular

262
00:10:58,879 --> 00:11:04,679
bacterial otus indicates um the relative

263
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:06,720
abundance of a bacterium in these three

264
00:11:04,679 --> 00:11:09,239
compartments and so what I've colorcoded

265
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:12,440
here are those bacteria that become

266
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:15,759
enriched in arabidopsis Roots relative

267
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:17,680
to unplanted soil and the rizosphere and

268
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:19,639
what when we when you do the taxonomic

269
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:22,638
assignments of these root enriched

270
00:11:19,639 --> 00:11:25,079
bacteria root enriched otus they

271
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:27,240
essentially Define three bacterial F

272
00:11:25,078 --> 00:11:28,838
they correspond to three bacterial F

273
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:30,759
which are called actinobacteria Proto

274
00:11:28,839 --> 00:11:32,959
bacteria and back to dat is so

275
00:11:30,759 --> 00:11:34,919
relatively at this High taxonomic rank

276
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:37,559
you know a relatively simple taxonomic

277
00:11:34,919 --> 00:11:40,639
structure the major take-home message

278
00:11:37,559 --> 00:11:42,518
from independent experiments carried out

279
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:44,480
um by David bulgarelli and our lab in

280
00:11:42,519 --> 00:11:48,799
Cologne and by Jeff dangles lab by Derek

281
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:50,879
lunbeck in the US really uh uh using um

282
00:11:48,799 --> 00:11:54,120
soils from from two different continents

283
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:56,120
in Europe and us uh is that soil type is

284
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:57,959
the main determinant of root microd

285
00:11:56,120 --> 00:12:00,759
composition how genotype contributes

286
00:11:57,958 --> 00:12:03,359
limited variation so relatively simple

287
00:12:00,759 --> 00:12:05,078
uh take- home message so since that time

288
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:07,919
when We examined really the structure of

289
00:12:05,078 --> 00:12:09,838
the arabidopsis rot microbal and also of

290
00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:11,639
uh some arabidopsis relatives there were

291
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:13,480
a number of additional studies now

292
00:12:11,639 --> 00:12:16,600
published these include various crop

293
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:19,159
plants barley maze uh Grape Wine and so

294
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:20,839
on and quite recently we've done a meta

295
00:12:19,159 --> 00:12:23,399
study we simply wanted to know how

296
00:12:20,839 --> 00:12:25,440
similar or dissimilar is the root

297
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:28,639
associated microbot in all of these

298
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:31,160
different plant species right that span

299
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:33,560
um about 150 million years of of

300
00:12:31,159 --> 00:12:37,000
evolution and the result is actually

301
00:12:33,559 --> 00:12:40,198
shown in uh this projection where each

302
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:43,759
of the dot uh represents a sample and

303
00:12:40,198 --> 00:12:47,120
the proximity of the dots represents uh

304
00:12:43,759 --> 00:12:50,120
the taxonomic similarity um of the of

305
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:53,159
the root microba and what you can see is

306
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:55,560
that essentially um the taxonomic

307
00:12:53,159 --> 00:12:57,679
structure of the root micro water from

308
00:12:55,559 --> 00:13:00,198
these different plant species is very

309
00:12:57,679 --> 00:13:02,278
similar to each other but when we

310
00:13:00,198 --> 00:13:04,958
compare the taxonomic structure of the

311
00:13:02,278 --> 00:13:08,198
root Associated bacterial microbot with

312
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:10,679
the gut with the human gut microbot it's

313
00:13:08,198 --> 00:13:13,278
it's there's essentially no overlap so

314
00:13:10,679 --> 00:13:15,879
although as you recall both the

315
00:13:13,278 --> 00:13:18,278
vertebrate gut and the root are if you

316
00:13:15,879 --> 00:13:20,320
like physiologically equivalent organs

317
00:13:18,278 --> 00:13:22,600
but you know it's it's it's very clear

318
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:24,320
the bacteria that populate our digestive

319
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:28,199
tract or of any other vertebrae are

320
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:30,440
totally different so um uh the major

321
00:13:28,198 --> 00:13:32,240
lesson from this is is uh there's a

322
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:35,000
conserved taxonomic structure of the

323
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:36,919
bacterial micro root microb at phm rank

324
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,399
Proto bacteria actinobacteria bacteria

325
00:13:36,919 --> 00:13:41,759
datus andic so it's it's a highly

326
00:13:39,399 --> 00:13:45,600
conserved plant

327
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:47,679
trait now about two years ago we we

328
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:50,199
weren't entirely satisfied with the type

329
00:13:47,679 --> 00:13:52,159
of work that we were doing and we we

330
00:13:50,198 --> 00:13:54,559
felt you know we were really reaching a

331
00:13:52,159 --> 00:13:56,439
ceiling um essentially what we were

332
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:58,518
doing is we were we were doing case

333
00:13:56,440 --> 00:14:01,120
control studies or time serious studies

334
00:13:58,519 --> 00:14:03,159
we applied the 16sr gene Community

335
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:05,440
profiling that I've explained to you

336
00:14:03,159 --> 00:14:07,600
we've applied metag genome sequencing

337
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:09,839
and then uh we inferred from these

338
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:11,800
results hypothesis that are based on

339
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:13,600
statistics on Advanced statistics but if

340
00:14:11,799 --> 00:14:15,679
you really look closely in our

341
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,399
Publications these are correlations

342
00:14:15,679 --> 00:14:20,638
between multiple variables and because

343
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:22,759
I'm trained as a geneticist I'm somewhat

344
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:25,680
I'm I'm not satisfied if you end up with

345
00:14:22,759 --> 00:14:27,399
qualitive observation so we felt that

346
00:14:25,679 --> 00:14:29,638
there might be an opportunity on the

347
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:32,320
long run to develop a new br brch of

348
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:34,560
plant microbol research and this Branch

349
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:37,278
might involve really systematic

350
00:14:34,559 --> 00:14:39,119
cultivation of um the bacterial plant

351
00:14:37,278 --> 00:14:41,360
microt so high throughput bacterial

352
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:43,198
cultivation and then if this were

353
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:45,079
successful then we could design

354
00:14:43,198 --> 00:14:47,439
synthetic bacterial communities that we

355
00:14:45,078 --> 00:14:49,638
call syncom um and then we could add

356
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:52,160
them to germfree uh plants and then we

357
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:53,680
could test the hypothesis you know from

358
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:56,000
these experiments and make scientific

359
00:14:53,679 --> 00:14:59,399
conclusions that are based on clation so

360
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,958
that was the idea but a potential caveat

361
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:03,039
is that when we were talking with our

362
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:05,359
colleagues from uh environmental

363
00:15:03,039 --> 00:15:07,319
microbiology that they told us well

364
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,959
whatever environmental sample you take

365
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:12,600
if you want to cultivate the bacteria

366
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:15,000
you can only cultivate barely 1% of them

367
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:17,560
so if that were true then of course you

368
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:20,039
could say well is this entire approach

369
00:15:17,559 --> 00:15:22,679
realistic right but there were reasons

370
00:15:20,039 --> 00:15:24,480
why we were skeptical with the claims of

371
00:15:22,679 --> 00:15:28,359
the environmental

372
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:30,720
microbiologists and um we therefore um

373
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:32,919
about two or 2 and a half years ago we

374
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,480
started to establish a reference culture

375
00:15:32,919 --> 00:15:36,559
collection of the arabidopsis root

376
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:40,360
microbot and this work is now impress in

377
00:15:36,559 --> 00:15:43,599
the British weekly so I um uh this

378
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:46,000
involves uh initially we collect Roots

379
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:48,040
again from plants grown in natural soil

380
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,720
we wash them we homogenize the roots and

381
00:15:48,039 --> 00:15:54,159
they're very simple we just uh PL the

382
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:57,199
root homogenates on on Ager plates or um

383
00:15:54,159 --> 00:16:00,159
on 96 microtiter plates with uh liquid

384
00:15:57,198 --> 00:16:02,838
media and as you can see um by these two

385
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:05,078
methods we've now been able to isolate

386
00:16:02,839 --> 00:16:08,399
more than 5,000 root derived um

387
00:16:05,078 --> 00:16:11,559
bacterial colonies and then we determine

388
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:14,000
just by sequencing the 6 in s RNA Gene

389
00:16:11,559 --> 00:16:16,318
sequences from all of these 5,800

390
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,318
bacterial colonies and this is why we

391
00:16:16,318 --> 00:16:21,278
call our culture collection sequence

392
00:16:18,318 --> 00:16:23,479
index risal libraries that are stored at

393
00:16:21,278 --> 00:16:25,799
minus 80° and can be used then for

394
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:27,759
subsequent

395
00:16:25,799 --> 00:16:29,719
experimentation so this is again to

396
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:32,879
remind you that our root culture

397
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:35,399
collection these 5,800 bacteria that

398
00:16:32,879 --> 00:16:38,799
they are isolated from arabidopsis

399
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:41,039
plants growing in Cologne soil and in

400
00:16:38,799 --> 00:16:44,278
parallel with our collaborator Julia

401
00:16:41,039 --> 00:16:47,399
fold at the eth sirich um we've also

402
00:16:44,278 --> 00:16:49,919
isolated Leaf Associated bacteria of

403
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:52,639
arabidopsis um about 3 and a half

404
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:55,278
thousand and keep in mind that these

405
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:58,480
leafes were harvested from arabidopsis

406
00:16:55,278 --> 00:17:01,120
populations growing either um um

407
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:04,318
surround in turich or in the vicinity of

408
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:08,078
of tubing so at at a geographic distance

409
00:17:04,318 --> 00:17:09,918
right so then in the next step this is

410
00:17:08,078 --> 00:17:12,279
really the most critical one because

411
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:15,160
what we needed what we had to do is to

412
00:17:12,279 --> 00:17:17,318
cross reference our culture Independent

413
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:19,240
Community data this is the six ands

414
00:17:17,318 --> 00:17:22,519
Community profiling with a culture

415
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:24,798
dependent approaches to really estimate

416
00:17:22,519 --> 00:17:27,199
you know what fraction of the root

417
00:17:24,798 --> 00:17:29,480
microbot can we actually recover as pure

418
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:32,360
bacterial isolates and that's shown on

419
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:35,160
this slide where the Inner Circle all of

420
00:17:32,359 --> 00:17:37,959
these small dots they represent

421
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:42,400
bacterial OT root Associated bacterial

422
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:45,319
otus from colog grow cologne soil grown

423
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:47,160
plants that we can resolve by the 6s

424
00:17:45,319 --> 00:17:51,200
Community profiling and in the outer

425
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:53,798
ring these uh um uh black squares they

426
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:56,640
indicate hits in our culture collection

427
00:17:53,798 --> 00:17:58,038
from these 5,800 culture collection and

428
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:01,400
the same is shown here for the leaf

429
00:17:58,038 --> 00:18:04,759
deriv p culture collection so um in

430
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:07,000
total we've now recovered more than 60%

431
00:18:04,759 --> 00:18:10,919
of the root and the leaf

432
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:13,240
Associated bacteria um so this is um

433
00:18:10,919 --> 00:18:15,240
clearly not a perfect culture collection

434
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:18,200
we still have some gaps but it's

435
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:22,880
certainly way more than the 1% that the

436
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:26,240
microbial ecologist wanted us to to

437
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:28,400
believe so um the next question then was

438
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:30,480
so from from these thousands of

439
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:33,600
thousands of of root and leaf Associated

440
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:35,839
bacteria we've we've um um characterized

441
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:38,678
really and assembled a core collection

442
00:18:35,839 --> 00:18:40,839
that is maximized for philogenetic um uh

443
00:18:38,679 --> 00:18:42,720
diversity and that's shown by these

444
00:18:40,839 --> 00:18:45,480
philogenetic trees in the center of

445
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:47,880
these um slides and and this represents

446
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:49,759
the color code is really according to

447
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:51,960
bacterium phm resolution so you see

448
00:18:49,759 --> 00:18:54,319
actinobacteria bacteria futs and and

449
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:56,360
Proto bacteria but then what we wanted

450
00:18:54,319 --> 00:18:58,079
to compare these two culture Collections

451
00:18:56,359 --> 00:19:00,798
and we wanted to know how similar or

452
00:18:58,079 --> 00:19:02,839
different this SAR are the bacteria that

453
00:19:00,798 --> 00:19:05,400
associate with healthy roots and leaves

454
00:19:02,839 --> 00:19:08,119
of arabidopsis and that is shown in the

455
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:10,240
most in the outermost ring by these

456
00:19:08,119 --> 00:19:13,719
green arrowheads or by the the brown

457
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:15,599
arrowheads because uh this denotes a

458
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:18,440
strain from our culture collection from

459
00:19:15,599 --> 00:19:20,678
leaves that shares greater than 97%

460
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:24,000
identical sixs sequences so it's

461
00:19:20,679 --> 00:19:26,559
essentially it's the same species and uh

462
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:29,400
we were quite surprised to learn that 40

463
00:19:26,558 --> 00:19:31,759
to 50% of the root and leaf D Bal

464
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:34,360
isolates share greater than 97 so

465
00:19:31,759 --> 00:19:36,319
essentially are same sequences and and

466
00:19:34,359 --> 00:19:38,678
the same bacterial species and we think

467
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:40,359
this is notable because recall our root

468
00:19:38,679 --> 00:19:42,000
and Lea derived culture collections were

469
00:19:40,359 --> 00:19:43,359
generated from plant material of

470
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,720
populations that are geographically

471
00:19:43,359 --> 00:19:48,000
widely separated 500 kilometers

472
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:51,480
apart so that's something to keep in

473
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:54,798
mind uh for later on so then in the next

474
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:57,599
step we thought um um it would be useful

475
00:19:54,798 --> 00:20:01,038
to determine whole genomes of all of our

476
00:19:57,599 --> 00:20:03,000
root and leaf associ bacteria and we

477
00:20:01,038 --> 00:20:06,679
generated whole genome assemblies and

478
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:08,880
also annotated U the genomes of 432

479
00:20:06,679 --> 00:20:11,280
microb members and then inferred a whole

480
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:13,360
genome philogenetic tree which is shown

481
00:20:11,279 --> 00:20:15,519
here which is largely congruent with a

482
00:20:13,359 --> 00:20:18,519
philogenetic tree that is purely based

483
00:20:15,519 --> 00:20:20,679
on the bacterial 6 ands ribosomal R but

484
00:20:18,519 --> 00:20:22,918
this is mainly you know archival but I

485
00:20:20,679 --> 00:20:26,038
think the genome sequences are of course

486
00:20:22,919 --> 00:20:28,120
a very powerful resource and one thing

487
00:20:26,038 --> 00:20:30,319
that we were of course interested in

488
00:20:28,119 --> 00:20:32,918
having access to these whole genome

489
00:20:30,319 --> 00:20:35,158
sequences is to study genomewide

490
00:20:32,919 --> 00:20:38,280
functional diversity between microbot

491
00:20:35,159 --> 00:20:41,559
members of the root and the the the um

492
00:20:38,279 --> 00:20:43,359
um leaf microbot and what we use for

493
00:20:41,558 --> 00:20:46,399
these experiments were really KAG

494
00:20:43,359 --> 00:20:48,599
annotated genes or k annotated Pathways

495
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:52,240
and then simply compare how similar or

496
00:20:48,599 --> 00:20:53,678
dissimilar are um those genes in in

497
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:56,798
these different genomes and what is

498
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:59,519
shown in these projections is each dot

499
00:20:56,798 --> 00:21:02,119
represents a bacterial genomes and I've

500
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:05,599
colorcoded uh the dots such that the r

501
00:21:02,119 --> 00:21:07,479
red dots uh represent root derived

502
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:09,639
bacteria and the green dots represent

503
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:13,558
Leaf derived bacteria and again

504
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:16,679
proximity is a measure of functional uh

505
00:21:13,558 --> 00:21:19,359
similarity or functional overlap and uh

506
00:21:16,679 --> 00:21:21,519
what we noted is that we can clearly

507
00:21:19,359 --> 00:21:25,199
resolve different clusters functional

508
00:21:21,519 --> 00:21:26,679
clusters functional capabilities of uh

509
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:29,640
these bacteria in our culture

510
00:21:26,679 --> 00:21:34,278
collections but the functional clust

511
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:38,200
um they mainly correspond uh to um

512
00:21:34,278 --> 00:21:39,960
bacterial phog to bacterial philogen so

513
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:42,240
that there's a strong philogenetic

514
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:44,079
signal but as you will see in most of

515
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:46,759
these clusters we find both root

516
00:21:44,079 --> 00:21:48,720
Associated and leaf Associated members

517
00:21:46,759 --> 00:21:50,640
so there must be a strong functional

518
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:52,798
overlap of members from the root and the

519
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:54,720
leaf microbol and there's actually only

520
00:21:52,798 --> 00:21:57,079
very few clusters where you can see a

521
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:59,278
separation so at this level we observed

522
00:21:57,079 --> 00:22:01,798
only weak signatures for n Niche

523
00:21:59,278 --> 00:22:04,359
specialization at the whole genome level

524
00:22:01,798 --> 00:22:06,720
and then Ruben gido he decided to take

525
00:22:04,359 --> 00:22:09,000
this analysis one step further and to

526
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:12,319
look really for differential enrichment

527
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:14,038
of functions at at um um individual

528
00:22:12,319 --> 00:22:16,480
functional categories and this for

529
00:22:14,038 --> 00:22:18,119
example involves carbohydrate metabolism

530
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:20,240
membrane transport so these are high

531
00:22:18,119 --> 00:22:23,199
level functions and what is shown here

532
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:25,120
this is a heat map and uh the relative

533
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:27,278
proportion of the genes that are

534
00:22:25,119 --> 00:22:30,399
annotated to these high level biological

535
00:22:27,278 --> 00:22:32,599
functions and in the upper part um Ruben

536
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:34,080
calculated for differential enrichment

537
00:22:32,599 --> 00:22:36,480
between the root and the leaf microb

538
00:22:34,079 --> 00:22:38,278
Auto members and what he noted was there

539
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:40,240
were two functional categories

540
00:22:38,278 --> 00:22:42,839
carbohydrate metabolism and I think

541
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:45,240
cobotics biodegradation and Metabolism

542
00:22:42,839 --> 00:22:47,119
where we see a highly significant uh

543
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:51,319
difference between the root and the leaf

544
00:22:47,119 --> 00:22:52,959
microbol members so at this level we see

545
00:22:51,319 --> 00:22:55,439
um clear evidence for Niche

546
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:58,880
specialization at individual at least at

547
00:22:55,440 --> 00:23:01,120
two uh individual functional categories

548
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:03,960
and again you know this might become

549
00:23:01,119 --> 00:23:06,639
important later on so now I would like

550
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:08,600
to come back and and to this scheme and

551
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:10,880
I hope I've convinced you that we have a

552
00:23:08,599 --> 00:23:12,558
decent culture collection from the root

553
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:14,760
and the leaf microbot we have the whole

554
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:16,558
genomes and we thought now we in the

555
00:23:14,759 --> 00:23:18,879
position that we can use this culture

556
00:23:16,558 --> 00:23:20,720
collection and design synthetic mural

557
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:23,320
communities add them to germ free plants

558
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:25,120
and then test uh particular um

559
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:27,399
hypothesis so this is what we call

560
00:23:25,119 --> 00:23:30,359
microbal reconstitution experiments in

561
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:32,159
the lab

562
00:23:30,359 --> 00:23:34,359
so for this purpose I need to introduce

563
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:36,080
to you keline clay which is an inert

564
00:23:34,359 --> 00:23:37,879
Matrix for condation of germ free

565
00:23:36,079 --> 00:23:40,918
arabidopsis plants with defined

566
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:44,278
bacterial communities it's very simple

567
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:48,000
you use this sterile keline clay and

568
00:23:44,278 --> 00:23:50,599
then you uh inoculate the keline clay

569
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,558
with defined input syn comps

570
00:23:50,599 --> 00:23:55,278
simultaneously with a sewing of surface

571
00:23:52,558 --> 00:23:57,960
sterilized arabidopsis seeds and then

572
00:23:55,278 --> 00:23:59,480
you you close the container you grow the

573
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:01,600
plants to together with the microbes in

574
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:03,599
a closed container it's a magenta box

575
00:24:01,599 --> 00:24:05,480
it's a very simple experimental system

576
00:24:03,599 --> 00:24:09,798
was actually originally developed this

577
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:12,720
system by um in uh in the lotos yonos

578
00:24:09,798 --> 00:24:14,639
community by y stat in in in Denmark and

579
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:17,679
then after seven weeks you determine

580
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:20,278
output syncom of kelen clay without host

581
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:22,960
roots and then you determine the output

582
00:24:20,278 --> 00:24:25,798
uh syncom in the roots and leaves using

583
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:28,519
6s Community profiling so I need to

584
00:24:25,798 --> 00:24:30,960
familiarize you how to read these uh

585
00:24:28,519 --> 00:24:33,519
data we typically display them by heat

586
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:35,759
maps and that's shown here this is an

587
00:24:33,519 --> 00:24:38,558
experiment where we've added a root

588
00:24:35,759 --> 00:24:39,798
derived 188 member syncom so from our

589
00:24:38,558 --> 00:24:43,200
culture collection these are all root

590
00:24:39,798 --> 00:24:46,200
derived bacteria and this is the input

591
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:47,440
syncom and uh the numbers indicate

592
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:50,240
biological

593
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:52,679
replicates so each row indicates a BAL

594
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:54,519
replicate and each line represents

595
00:24:52,679 --> 00:24:57,559
either a single bacterial strain or

596
00:24:54,519 --> 00:25:00,440
group of bacterial strains and the color

597
00:24:57,558 --> 00:25:03,200
code indic Ates the relative abundance

598
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:05,120
color code is relative abundance we try

599
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:08,840
for the for the input Community

600
00:25:05,119 --> 00:25:11,079
inoculate U the bacteria at a 1:1 ratio

601
00:25:08,839 --> 00:25:12,639
so when after 7 weeks if we look at the

602
00:25:11,079 --> 00:25:15,319
root output Community you can see

603
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:17,799
there's a marked Community shift so this

604
00:25:15,319 --> 00:25:19,918
community shift can either be dependent

605
00:25:17,798 --> 00:25:22,720
on the host but it can also be host

606
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:24,320
independent and to discriminate between

607
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:26,360
those two possibilities we also

608
00:25:24,319 --> 00:25:28,480
incubated the input Community for 7

609
00:25:26,359 --> 00:25:30,038
weeks just in unplanted clay in the ABS

610
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:32,880
of those and you see also a marked

611
00:25:30,038 --> 00:25:34,839
Community shift but if you then compare

612
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:37,320
the output community in unplanted clay

613
00:25:34,839 --> 00:25:38,839
in Roots then you will note numerous

614
00:25:37,319 --> 00:25:40,839
changes for example the relative

615
00:25:38,839 --> 00:25:42,759
abundance of this bacterium increases

616
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:43,959
this one barely grows in unplanted clay

617
00:25:42,759 --> 00:25:45,839
but in the presence of the root is

618
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:47,960
really dramatically enriched this

619
00:25:45,839 --> 00:25:49,639
bacterium which is dominant in the

620
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:51,759
absence of the host becomes depleted

621
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:54,919
from root so you see really significant

622
00:25:51,759 --> 00:25:57,798
changes but the surprise came when we

623
00:25:54,919 --> 00:26:00,640
also analyzed leaves from these bacteria

624
00:25:57,798 --> 00:26:02,558
so seven weeks later because we noted

625
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:05,399
that now many of the root derived

626
00:26:02,558 --> 00:26:07,879
bacteria can also colonize arabidopsis

627
00:26:05,398 --> 00:26:10,079
leap so there's an ectopic localization

628
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:12,760
and ectopic colonization of these Root

629
00:26:10,079 --> 00:26:15,119
Drive bacteria that was uh somewhat

630
00:26:12,759 --> 00:26:17,798
surprising now the nice thing about this

631
00:26:15,119 --> 00:26:20,558
experimental system it's quite flexible

632
00:26:17,798 --> 00:26:23,240
so um you can grow those arabidopsis

633
00:26:20,558 --> 00:26:25,359
plants for 3 weeks then you can open the

634
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:28,319
magenta boxes and you can spray them

635
00:26:25,359 --> 00:26:30,038
with a leaf derived bacteria and then

636
00:26:28,319 --> 00:26:31,839
you incubate them co- incubate them for

637
00:26:30,038 --> 00:26:35,200
another week and then do community

638
00:26:31,839 --> 00:26:37,678
profiling after 7

639
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:39,600
weeks and I think this slide shows the

640
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:42,278
result again this is a highly Complex

641
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:44,319
Community 226 members this is the input

642
00:26:42,278 --> 00:26:46,119
communities now we have only Leaf Drive

643
00:26:44,319 --> 00:26:48,960
bacteria this is why the root ones are

644
00:26:46,119 --> 00:26:50,759
negative are black and expectedly and we

645
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:52,558
were quite pleased about this most of

646
00:26:50,759 --> 00:26:54,038
these Leaf Drive bacteria can abundantly

647
00:26:52,558 --> 00:26:56,519
colonized leaves that's not so

648
00:26:54,038 --> 00:26:59,240
surprising but the surprise again is if

649
00:26:56,519 --> 00:27:01,119
you now look at the roots then you see a

650
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:03,440
substantial proportional subset of the

651
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:06,038
leaf derived bacteria can ectopically

652
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:07,960
also colonize Roots so bacteria from

653
00:27:06,038 --> 00:27:10,798
Roots go up to leaves and bacteria from

654
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:12,759
leaves go down to roots of course we

655
00:27:10,798 --> 00:27:15,879
have to quantify these results this is

656
00:27:12,759 --> 00:27:19,038
where we use a bit more quantitative um

657
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:20,679
um analysis of these Community profiles

658
00:27:19,038 --> 00:27:23,200
these are principal component analysis

659
00:27:20,679 --> 00:27:26,200
of break Curtis dissimilarity matrices

660
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:28,480
in principle um each of these or in a

661
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:30,880
simple terms each of these dots

662
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:34,480
represents the community from a single

663
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:36,440
magenta box with four plants and uh what

664
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:38,558
I've colorcoded here this is the input

665
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:40,840
Community where we added The Root Drive

666
00:27:38,558 --> 00:27:43,158
bacteria to the keline clay and these

667
00:27:40,839 --> 00:27:45,359
are the output communities output

668
00:27:43,159 --> 00:27:48,000
communities uh in the absence of the

669
00:27:45,359 --> 00:27:49,719
host this is the root Associated output

670
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,880
community and the leaf Associated output

671
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:53,960
Community it's very clear that the root

672
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:55,559
and the leaf output communities are

673
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:57,000
different and they're also different

674
00:27:55,558 --> 00:27:59,319
from the output communities in the

675
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:01,000
absence of the host so this is the host

676
00:27:59,319 --> 00:28:03,918
Independent Community shift and this is

677
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:05,640
the host dependent Community shift and

678
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:07,720
this was the second experiment that I

679
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:10,080
explained to you uh where we spray

680
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:12,399
inoculate the leaf dve bacteria to

681
00:28:10,079 --> 00:28:13,960
leaves and this is the input Community

682
00:28:12,398 --> 00:28:16,119
output community on the leaves and

683
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:19,278
output Comm ectopic colonization on

684
00:28:16,119 --> 00:28:21,839
Roots so take home message uh from these

685
00:28:19,278 --> 00:28:24,640
experiments root and leaf derived sync

686
00:28:21,839 --> 00:28:27,199
comps colonize cognate host organs but

687
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:30,120
they're also capable of ectopic leaf and

688
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:32,960
root colonization that's something that

689
00:28:30,119 --> 00:28:35,839
was rather unexpected so summarize this

690
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:38,600
part of my presentation we interpret

691
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:40,639
these data such that the leaf microbot

692
00:28:38,599 --> 00:28:42,879
appears to be a derived form of the roof

693
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:45,679
microba we think really the major

694
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:47,440
inoculum source for leaf Associated

695
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:50,000
bacteria are derived from root

696
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:52,159
Associated bacteria and from soil uh

697
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:54,079
bacteria and this is based on an

698
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:55,679
extensive species intersection between

699
00:28:54,079 --> 00:28:57,199
the leaf and the root micro Waters using

700
00:28:55,679 --> 00:29:00,278
this culture Independent Community

701
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:02,200
profiling and I think there's also now

702
00:29:00,278 --> 00:29:04,558
support on the basis of whole genome

703
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:06,480
drafts more than 400 isolates that

704
00:29:04,558 --> 00:29:09,200
revealed this large overlap of genome

705
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:11,679
encoded functional um capabilities but

706
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:13,038
also uh significant differences at the

707
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:15,759
level of individual functional

708
00:29:13,038 --> 00:29:18,720
categories and I think this is now most

709
00:29:15,759 --> 00:29:21,158
strongly supported by our microbol

710
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:24,278
reconstitution uh experiments showing

711
00:29:21,159 --> 00:29:26,399
that leaf and Root Drive sycom colonize

712
00:29:24,278 --> 00:29:28,599
cognet host organs and are capable of

713
00:29:26,398 --> 00:29:31,158
ectopic leaf and and root colon and I

714
00:29:28,599 --> 00:29:34,079
think this really raises the possibility

715
00:29:31,159 --> 00:29:36,840
that um bacteria from Roots make it up

716
00:29:34,079 --> 00:29:38,678
um to above ground parts and and vice

717
00:29:36,839 --> 00:29:40,678
versa so I think there's an unexpected

718
00:29:38,679 --> 00:29:42,720
dynamic between the leaf and the

719
00:29:40,679 --> 00:29:45,480
microbot and I think some evidence I

720
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:48,200
don't have time to go into details um

721
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:49,919
we've also now strong evidence um for

722
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:51,360
microbot specialization to their

723
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:54,200
respective

724
00:29:51,359 --> 00:29:57,038
Niche all right so I thought that in the

725
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:59,519
next um five or 10 minutes i' I'd tell

726
00:29:57,038 --> 00:30:02,158
you a little bit more how we now take

727
00:29:59,519 --> 00:30:05,319
advantage of our culture collections of

728
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:07,399
the root microbol to test proposed

729
00:30:05,319 --> 00:30:09,759
functions of the microbot and one of the

730
00:30:07,398 --> 00:30:11,719
proposed functions um from an early

731
00:30:09,759 --> 00:30:13,759
timeo was really indirect pathogen

732
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:15,600
protection so this is now again a bottom

733
00:30:13,759 --> 00:30:17,919
up approach where we use this

734
00:30:15,599 --> 00:30:20,918
reconstitution experiments to to test

735
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:22,519
this this function and um for this

736
00:30:20,919 --> 00:30:24,759
purpose I need to introduce to you

737
00:30:22,519 --> 00:30:27,480
fusarium oxysporum I'm sure many of you

738
00:30:24,759 --> 00:30:30,079
will be aware of this fungal pathogen of

739
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:33,000
arabid that severely inhibit arabidopsis

740
00:30:30,079 --> 00:30:36,879
grows so if you grow arabidopsis just

741
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:38,599
eally on um on Ager plates this is how

742
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:41,200
it looks like you know for yeah

743
00:30:38,599 --> 00:30:44,240
germ-free plants but if you add fusarium

744
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:47,159
oxos sporum um the plants really grow

745
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:49,919
very poorly and um one can actually

746
00:30:47,159 --> 00:30:52,880
visualize growth of this fusarium uh

747
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:55,840
fungus by lectin staining pharum oxos is

748
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:58,399
a soil born vascular pathogen these are

749
00:30:55,839 --> 00:31:00,599
the fungal hyi that surround paropsis

750
00:30:58,398 --> 00:31:04,359
roots and the fungus also makes it into

751
00:31:00,599 --> 00:31:08,558
the vasculature and um uh really this

752
00:31:04,359 --> 00:31:12,558
this results in this severe um disease

753
00:31:08,558 --> 00:31:14,558
symptoms and um what we were wondering

754
00:31:12,558 --> 00:31:18,918
is and these are experiments from Yang

755
00:31:14,558 --> 00:31:23,158
Bai and K hiruma what would happen if we

756
00:31:18,919 --> 00:31:25,240
um co- inoculate Our Roots with fusarium

757
00:31:23,159 --> 00:31:27,679
oxysporum spores and individual root

758
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:29,679
microbol from our culture collection

759
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:32,360
right and and this shows the difference

760
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:34,559
so the the presence of this B1 bacterium

761
00:31:32,359 --> 00:31:36,678
plus oxos essentially rescues

762
00:31:34,558 --> 00:31:38,558
arabidopsis grow and we can see also

763
00:31:36,679 --> 00:31:41,919
some rescue in the presence of this

764
00:31:38,558 --> 00:31:44,918
bacterium but this bacterium has no um

765
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:46,759
antifungal activity and uh this

766
00:31:44,919 --> 00:31:49,399
correlates indeed if you look

767
00:31:46,759 --> 00:31:51,359
microscopically um the the fusarium Hy

768
00:31:49,398 --> 00:31:54,239
in the presence of these bacteria are

769
00:31:51,359 --> 00:31:56,719
highly distorted and in in in in almost

770
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:58,359
all cases the fungus cannot any longer

771
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:01,159
enter the the vascular

772
00:31:58,359 --> 00:32:03,240
of of of roots so of course we had to do

773
00:32:01,159 --> 00:32:06,720
this more systematically and young and

774
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:10,720
and K they tested about 50 of our Riso

775
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:14,319
bacterial strains and we Quantified um

776
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:16,639
the protective activity of um these

777
00:32:14,319 --> 00:32:19,359
bacteria against fusarium infection by

778
00:32:16,638 --> 00:32:21,798
measuring shoot fresh weight and so

779
00:32:19,359 --> 00:32:24,879
these are the controls uh this is if you

780
00:32:21,798 --> 00:32:27,000
incubate arop plants with fusarium alone

781
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:29,360
uh the plants essentially die and if you

782
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:32,119
grow the maxic this is the this is a

783
00:32:29,359 --> 00:32:35,278
shoot fresh weight and then this is the

784
00:32:32,119 --> 00:32:38,239
shoot fresh weight in these Turner

785
00:32:35,278 --> 00:32:40,038
interactions so the host the bacterium

786
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:43,759
and the fungus and we see a range of

787
00:32:40,038 --> 00:32:47,278
infection phenotypes we can uh broadly

788
00:32:43,759 --> 00:32:49,000
um Define three categories um one

789
00:32:47,278 --> 00:32:51,759
category is these Riso bacteria where

790
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:53,638
there's unrestricted fusarium hyy growth

791
00:32:51,759 --> 00:32:55,480
there's intermediate growth and then

792
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:58,719
these bacteria are really strongly

793
00:32:55,480 --> 00:33:02,440
protect arabidopsis against f

794
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:04,079
and um if you um uh overlay um on these

795
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:06,278
results those bacteria that are highly

796
00:33:04,079 --> 00:33:09,240
root and Rich you you will note that in

797
00:33:06,278 --> 00:33:11,919
this class we find almost only bacteria

798
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:14,120
that are highly root enriched members of

799
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:17,200
the the microt and they are

800
00:33:14,119 --> 00:33:20,079
taxonomically quite diverse um bacteria

801
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:21,600
so one of our hypothesis on the basis of

802
00:33:20,079 --> 00:33:23,638
this result was that evolutionary

803
00:33:21,599 --> 00:33:25,278
selection might have favored root microb

804
00:33:23,638 --> 00:33:29,000
auto members with strong protective

805
00:33:25,278 --> 00:33:33,000
activity against soil born pathogenic

806
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:35,880
funi so um Stefan Haka a postto in the

807
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:38,159
lab he decided to test this hypothesis

808
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:41,440
by extending our work from fusarium

809
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:44,399
oxysporum to another soulborn um really

810
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:47,278
an economically relevant pathogen vedum

811
00:33:44,398 --> 00:33:51,000
and plos cumarina and another root

812
00:33:47,278 --> 00:33:53,519
infecting um Kum pathogen kot trium

813
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:55,919
incanum but but he decided you know

814
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:58,399
rather than using this time consuming

815
00:33:55,919 --> 00:34:01,120
and and really complex experiment with

816
00:33:58,398 --> 00:34:03,879
the fungus the host and the bacterium

817
00:34:01,119 --> 00:34:06,119
just to test binary interaction so just

818
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:07,919
co- incubate the fungal pathogens and

819
00:34:06,119 --> 00:34:09,440
the individual rise of bacteria from our

820
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:11,878
culture collection so these are he

821
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:14,159
tested a total of 90 of them and then he

822
00:34:11,878 --> 00:34:17,319
developed a quantitative readout to

823
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:19,559
measure fungal growth in these co-

824
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:22,240
cultures so this is all done in 96

825
00:34:19,559 --> 00:34:24,159
microtiter plates and the results of

826
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:25,559
these testing the interactions of these

827
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:27,720
rise of bacteria individual rise of

828
00:34:25,559 --> 00:34:29,679
bacteria with these four different fungi

829
00:34:27,719 --> 00:34:31,959
the results are shown in from triplicate

830
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:33,878
experiments for each of the four fungi

831
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:36,240
and they are visualized by a heat map

832
00:34:33,878 --> 00:34:38,358
where the cool blue colors indicate

833
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:41,559
fungal growth inhibition and the red

834
00:34:38,358 --> 00:34:43,878
colors indicate growth promotion and I

835
00:34:41,559 --> 00:34:47,039
hope you agree with me uh what we could

836
00:34:43,878 --> 00:34:49,519
see is that the individual um uh

837
00:34:47,039 --> 00:34:53,320
philogenetic lineages of the root

838
00:34:49,519 --> 00:34:55,440
microbot that prefer that confer strong

839
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:58,240
protective activity against all of these

840
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:59,800
four fungi for example these araa

841
00:34:58,239 --> 00:35:02,439
uh than the pseudomonas here and the

842
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:05,000
mesor rium and there are other ones the

843
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:07,639
streptomyces they're very potent against

844
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:11,880
fum oxysporum but their activity against

845
00:35:07,639 --> 00:35:14,000
plos Karina is is is lousy and So based

846
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:16,800
on these results and when we compare the

847
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:19,639
results from these binary uh interaction

848
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:22,079
screen with these uh tritrophic

849
00:35:19,639 --> 00:35:24,920
interaction uh system you will note that

850
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:27,359
there's clear overlap between the

851
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:29,039
results so what we conclude from these

852
00:35:27,358 --> 00:35:31,000
EXP performance is that specific

853
00:35:29,039 --> 00:35:33,039
taxonomic lineages of the bacterial root

854
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:35,159
micr water exert direct inhibitory

855
00:35:33,039 --> 00:35:38,358
activity you don't necessarily need the

856
00:35:35,159 --> 00:35:40,279
host that that's very important um and

857
00:35:38,358 --> 00:35:43,920
against a wide range of soil born

858
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:46,960
pathogenic root colonizing fungi so what

859
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:49,200
we infer from these experiments that

860
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:51,318
indirect protection against soil born

861
00:35:49,199 --> 00:35:53,199
fungal pathogen is a major physiological

862
00:35:51,318 --> 00:35:56,800
function of the arop bacterial root

863
00:35:53,199 --> 00:35:58,759
microbot so essentially it looks it it

864
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:01,440
looks you know as as if arabidopsis

865
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:04,240
really recruits a subset of the soil

866
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:06,519
bacteria right and and that many of

867
00:36:04,239 --> 00:36:09,399
these root Associated and root enriched

868
00:36:06,519 --> 00:36:12,838
bacteria uh help the plant to protect

869
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:14,039
itself against attack from these um soil

870
00:36:12,838 --> 00:36:16,440
born fungal

871
00:36:14,039 --> 00:36:18,119
pathogens now you could still criticize

872
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:21,240
us and you could say well you know this

873
00:36:18,119 --> 00:36:23,079
is um you've just tested one fungus one

874
00:36:21,239 --> 00:36:25,239
bacterium and one host it's still not in

875
00:36:23,079 --> 00:36:27,359
a community context so this is really

876
00:36:25,239 --> 00:36:31,078
now I think going in the right direction

877
00:36:27,358 --> 00:36:33,159
um where we've uh now tested um this is

878
00:36:31,079 --> 00:36:36,039
in the keline clay system if you just

879
00:36:33,159 --> 00:36:39,199
focus on this one uh these are germfree

880
00:36:36,039 --> 00:36:40,838
plants uh this is when we add 30 of our

881
00:36:39,199 --> 00:36:43,719
bacterial Riso bacteria that we've

882
00:36:40,838 --> 00:36:46,159
tested also in the in the binary or the

883
00:36:43,719 --> 00:36:48,639
tritrophic interaction system the plants

884
00:36:46,159 --> 00:36:50,318
still grow happily but this is if we

885
00:36:48,639 --> 00:36:53,039
really incubate the plants with our

886
00:36:50,318 --> 00:36:55,480
deadly mix of of four soil born fungal

887
00:36:53,039 --> 00:36:57,719
pathogens and the plants essentially die

888
00:36:55,480 --> 00:37:00,000
and if you add then the fungal community

889
00:36:57,719 --> 00:37:03,399
and the 30 micro members you see this

890
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:05,800
rescue so I think this suggests really

891
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:09,160
that um the protection against the

892
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:10,720
soulborn pathogen also can be reproduced

893
00:37:09,159 --> 00:37:12,679
under laboratory conditions in a

894
00:37:10,719 --> 00:37:16,239
community

895
00:37:12,679 --> 00:37:18,399
context all right so I think do I still

896
00:37:16,239 --> 00:37:21,279
have yes I think I still have 10 minutes

897
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:22,920
or so um because I promised that during

898
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:25,280
the last part of my presentation and

899
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:27,639
also because Maria is in the uh in the

900
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:30,800
audience um I mentioned in my

901
00:37:27,639 --> 00:37:33,279
introduction that the root that the

902
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:35,839
plant microbot does not involve only

903
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:38,800
bacteria but they are also association

904
00:37:35,838 --> 00:37:41,719
between healthy plants and fungi and

905
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:45,000
this illustrates the beautiful

906
00:37:41,719 --> 00:37:47,039
biodiversity of fungi root Associated

907
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:50,599
fungi that we've isolated from

908
00:37:47,039 --> 00:37:53,519
arabidopsis Roots and uh so these are

909
00:37:50,599 --> 00:37:55,079
all um uh fungal endophytes that we've

910
00:37:53,519 --> 00:37:58,039
isolated from surface sterilized

911
00:37:55,079 --> 00:38:00,039
arabidopsis Roots grown in natural soil

912
00:37:58,039 --> 00:38:04,358
now

913
00:38:00,039 --> 00:38:07,358
one difficulty with the uh fungal

914
00:38:04,358 --> 00:38:09,920
endophytes or with the fungal microbot

915
00:38:07,358 --> 00:38:12,159
if you like is that plant Associated

916
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:14,519
fungi are hyper diverse in natural plant

917
00:38:12,159 --> 00:38:16,078
populations so this is fundamentally

918
00:38:14,519 --> 00:38:18,039
different from the bacterial root microw

919
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:20,318
water recall you know I mentioned to you

920
00:38:18,039 --> 00:38:21,800
there's a highly reproducible taxonomic

921
00:38:20,318 --> 00:38:24,079
structure consisting of this Proto

922
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:26,400
bacteria actinobacteria and so on but

923
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:29,599
for fungi you know this is terrible you

924
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:31,880
know you you you just isolate too many

925
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:33,838
um and and that makes it difficult to

926
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:36,039
discriminate between stochastic

927
00:38:33,838 --> 00:38:38,759
encounters and associations that have

928
00:38:36,039 --> 00:38:41,960
ecophysiological relevance that's really

929
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:44,680
that's a challenge and one way to

930
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:47,599
overcome that limitation is that you

931
00:38:44,679 --> 00:38:49,480
sample over successive years and this

932
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:51,039
illustrates you how we've done it and I

933
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:55,039
want to discuss with you this is work

934
00:38:51,039 --> 00:38:57,039
that is now in revision um um um yeah

935
00:38:55,039 --> 00:38:58,880
how we do those those experiments so we

936
00:38:57,039 --> 00:39:02,519
isolate ated this fungus which is called

937
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:05,358
colot trium teli from healthy

938
00:39:02,519 --> 00:39:07,679
asymptomatic plants in natural

939
00:39:05,358 --> 00:39:10,440
arabidopsis populations of the central

940
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:13,039
plateau of Spain and and you can see

941
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:15,358
these are four different populations and

942
00:39:13,039 --> 00:39:18,079
uh it's really an endemic fungus uh in

943
00:39:15,358 --> 00:39:20,039
the central plateau of Spain We examined

944
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:22,920
habitats from Germany and France and we

945
00:39:20,039 --> 00:39:25,960
could not detect this Fung but here you

946
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:27,920
it's really it's persistent over

947
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:30,599
consecutive years there was one other

948
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:33,480
reason why this fungus attracted us uh

949
00:39:30,599 --> 00:39:37,280
and I think the the the Pathologists you

950
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:39,760
know may know this because um almost all

951
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:42,079
characterized colit trium fungal species

952
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:44,599
cause plant diseases you know this is

953
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:46,519
Tel these are some of its cousins and

954
00:39:44,599 --> 00:39:50,119
they cause diseases on fruits and leaves

955
00:39:46,519 --> 00:39:53,159
and Roots so um so why you know why is

956
00:39:50,119 --> 00:39:55,280
this fungus is it capable to engage in

957
00:39:53,159 --> 00:39:57,519
association with healthy asymptomatic

958
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:59,240
plants so that was something that we

959
00:39:57,519 --> 00:40:01,800
wanted to understand in Greater detail

960
00:39:59,239 --> 00:40:04,358
and one important clue really came uh

961
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:07,640
from a closer look at the natural

962
00:40:04,358 --> 00:40:09,159
habitat where you find this fungus so I

963
00:40:07,639 --> 00:40:10,799
I don't know whether any one of you had

964
00:40:09,159 --> 00:40:13,480
ever had the chance to visit the central

965
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:16,480
plateau of Spain this is really a harsh

966
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:18,920
environment and the soil um is very low

967
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:21,440
in nutrients in particular it's it's low

968
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:23,000
in in in phosphate and so these poor

969
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:24,760
arabidopsis plants they really have a

970
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:26,039
hard time to survive in these

971
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:30,480
arabidopsis

972
00:40:26,039 --> 00:40:32,440
populations so um uh what we thought is

973
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:34,440
um to better characterize sorry I need

974
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:36,559
to go back to better characterize this

975
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:39,079
system that we again apply our

976
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:40,400
reductionist approach that I explained

977
00:40:39,079 --> 00:40:43,400
to you before with the bacterial

978
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:46,280
microbot with this um plant fungus

979
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:50,160
interaction and so we generated uh a

980
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:52,319
transgenic uh gfp expressing kriel we

981
00:40:50,159 --> 00:40:54,838
inoculated it with the germfree aops

982
00:40:52,318 --> 00:40:56,880
plants this an aops plants expressing a

983
00:40:54,838 --> 00:40:59,480
plma membrane Mar protein and we notice

984
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:01,640
this if fungus really forms dense extra

985
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:03,079
rical Hy surrounding arabidopsis Roots

986
00:41:01,639 --> 00:41:05,000
but if you take a cross-section through

987
00:41:03,079 --> 00:41:08,000
a root this is really remarkable you

988
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:10,519
know the fungus um ramifies within the

989
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:13,318
root tissue it's um you know these are

990
00:41:10,519 --> 00:41:15,679
all fundal Hy you find them between uh

991
00:41:13,318 --> 00:41:17,960
arbid opsis root cells but also inside

992
00:41:15,679 --> 00:41:20,239
root cells is really extensive

993
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:22,159
colonization of of of the root and

994
00:41:20,239 --> 00:41:25,879
without causing visible symptoms so in

995
00:41:22,159 --> 00:41:27,920
the lab the plants stay healthy so um

996
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:30,720
because of this habitat feature and the

997
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:33,079
low nutrient um conditions we wondered

998
00:41:30,719 --> 00:41:35,279
you know what will happen uh if we grow

999
00:41:33,079 --> 00:41:37,920
arabidopsis under defined nutrient

1000
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:41,920
limiting conditions and we tested

1001
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:44,400
phosphate nitrate and uh this is um the

1002
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:46,800
typical seven know these are four week

1003
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:50,480
old arabidopsis plants grown under low

1004
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:53,200
phosphate conditions 50 micro at this

1005
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:55,599
condition um arabidopsis initiates the

1006
00:41:53,199 --> 00:41:58,159
phosphate station response the roots are

1007
00:41:55,599 --> 00:42:00,039
stunted and there's red used shoot

1008
00:41:58,159 --> 00:42:02,879
biomass and this is what happens when

1009
00:42:00,039 --> 00:42:04,480
you add this col to trium toel roots are

1010
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:07,119
elongated and there's an increase in

1011
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:10,119
shoot biomass we can quantify uh the

1012
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:12,559
shoot fresh weight um this is the mock

1013
00:42:10,119 --> 00:42:14,318
control this is if you add the tof

1014
00:42:12,559 --> 00:42:16,519
fungus so there's a growth promotion

1015
00:42:14,318 --> 00:42:18,639
activity this is an important control

1016
00:42:16,519 --> 00:42:21,400
heat killed fungus and this is another

1017
00:42:18,639 --> 00:42:24,598
important control when we add the cousin

1018
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:26,639
of telde which is the pathogenic incanum

1019
00:42:24,599 --> 00:42:28,960
root colonizing incanum fungus and

1020
00:42:26,639 --> 00:42:31,679
there's a of course a reduction in in

1021
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:33,480
biomass and importantly under high

1022
00:42:31,679 --> 00:42:35,358
phosphate level so sufficient phosphate

1023
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:38,000
level if you add the fungus there's no

1024
00:42:35,358 --> 00:42:40,838
increase in SHO biomass but it's not

1025
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:43,880
only that arabidopsis gr that this

1026
00:42:40,838 --> 00:42:46,480
fungus promotes arabidopsis growth under

1027
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:48,200
uh low phosphate but it also increases

1028
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:49,559
the fertility so the reproductive

1029
00:42:48,199 --> 00:42:51,519
Fitness of the plants and you can

1030
00:42:49,559 --> 00:42:53,280
measure that simply by counting the

1031
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:54,440
number of fruits of arabidopsis and

1032
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:57,280
there's it's very clear there's an

1033
00:42:54,440 --> 00:43:00,280
increase in the fruit number

1034
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:02,000
so how how does this fungus promote

1035
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:04,119
arabidopsis growth under phosphate

1036
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:06,039
limiting conditions and this is how we

1037
00:43:04,119 --> 00:43:08,880
took advantage of the tools that have

1038
00:43:06,039 --> 00:43:11,400
been developed by the microa community

1039
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:13,800
and um the way how we conduct these

1040
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:16,920
experiments we grow arabidopsis plants

1041
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:20,200
on um these large Ager plates and inside

1042
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:23,119
the Ager plates we um we place a small

1043
00:43:20,199 --> 00:43:26,239
patri dish and in the small petri dish

1044
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:29,559
uh we add the fungal spores and uh we

1045
00:43:26,239 --> 00:43:31,879
add p 33 so Auto phosphate radioactively

1046
00:43:29,559 --> 00:43:33,880
labeled Auto phosphate and then what

1047
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:35,800
happens is the fungus grows you know

1048
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:37,640
outside of this inner compartment

1049
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:41,039
establishes connectivities with the

1050
00:43:37,639 --> 00:43:44,078
roots and then we measure radioactivity

1051
00:43:41,039 --> 00:43:46,440
in the chotes after 3 weeks of

1052
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:49,000
co-incubation and the results the kilo

1053
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:51,838
beel you know per gram dry weight in

1054
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:53,960
individual plants is shown in in this

1055
00:43:51,838 --> 00:43:56,558
plot and I hope you agree with me that

1056
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:58,760
there is really a remarkable amount of

1057
00:43:56,559 --> 00:44:01,640
phosphate that is transferred from the

1058
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:04,839
Fungus via the H via the roots uh to the

1059
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:07,078
Chute and importantly if we now use the

1060
00:44:04,838 --> 00:44:10,558
pathogenic cousin of

1061
00:44:07,079 --> 00:44:12,519
kriel there's um you know very minor

1062
00:44:10,559 --> 00:44:15,040
transfer and what I find even more

1063
00:44:12,519 --> 00:44:16,920
remarkable under high phosphate

1064
00:44:15,039 --> 00:44:19,960
conditions so phosphate sufficient

1065
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:22,400
amounts then this beneficial fungus teli

1066
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:25,119
cannot transform any longer phosphate to

1067
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:27,920
the shoes so what this tells us is that

1068
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:30,880
the transfer of phosphate is strictly

1069
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:34,639
regulated on phosphate availability in

1070
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:37,039
the medium right so we wondered of

1071
00:44:34,639 --> 00:44:38,679
course what is the genetic control of

1072
00:44:37,039 --> 00:44:40,880
this and I mentioned before that

1073
00:44:38,679 --> 00:44:44,078
arabidopsis and all plants have

1074
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:46,440
developed a complex genetic system uh to

1075
00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:49,119
monitor phosphate availability and then

1076
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:50,838
to adjust growth in response to

1077
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:53,160
phosphate station that's the phosphate

1078
00:44:50,838 --> 00:44:54,679
station response system and so we

1079
00:44:53,159 --> 00:44:56,639
wondered you know whether this growth

1080
00:44:54,679 --> 00:44:58,078
promotion that we see in wild typ plants

1081
00:44:56,639 --> 00:45:00,118
whether that is dependent on these

1082
00:44:58,079 --> 00:45:03,680
genetic components and this shows you

1083
00:45:00,119 --> 00:45:05,599
one results this is the phf1 gene that

1084
00:45:03,679 --> 00:45:08,118
is actually necessary to release

1085
00:45:05,599 --> 00:45:09,920
phosphate Transporters from the ER to

1086
00:45:08,119 --> 00:45:12,640
the plasma membrane and if you look into

1087
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:14,800
that mutant you know clearly um the

1088
00:45:12,639 --> 00:45:17,039
plant growth promotion is impaired and

1089
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:19,200
what I find more interestingly if you

1090
00:45:17,039 --> 00:45:21,759
now measure fungal biomass in this

1091
00:45:19,199 --> 00:45:24,000
mutant only under low phosphate

1092
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:27,160
conditions then you see excessive growth

1093
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:29,679
so then this very sophisticated

1094
00:45:27,159 --> 00:45:32,159
beneficial interaction is is is

1095
00:45:29,679 --> 00:45:35,879
impaired all right so then in the next

1096
00:45:32,159 --> 00:45:38,719
step we were interested in examining um

1097
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:40,680
um at the transcriptome level changes

1098
00:45:38,719 --> 00:45:42,519
transcriptional reprogramming induced by

1099
00:45:40,679 --> 00:45:44,838
the fungus and so for this purpose we've

1100
00:45:42,519 --> 00:45:47,559
carried out time resolved RNA seek

1101
00:45:44,838 --> 00:45:50,239
experiments and um we noted that in

1102
00:45:47,559 --> 00:45:51,960
arabidopsis Roots um there's a large

1103
00:45:50,239 --> 00:45:53,719
number of genes that are differentially

1104
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:56,400
regulated these are 16 pair wise

1105
00:45:53,719 --> 00:45:58,598
comparisons very complex uh data set but

1106
00:45:56,400 --> 00:46:01,280
I want to pay your attention just to

1107
00:45:58,599 --> 00:46:03,838
this cluster of genes cluster nine genes

1108
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:06,359
that are specifically

1109
00:46:03,838 --> 00:46:08,239
upregulated in the presence of

1110
00:46:06,358 --> 00:46:10,358
sufficient amounts of phosphate and in

1111
00:46:08,239 --> 00:46:12,118
the presence of the beneficial fungus

1112
00:46:10,358 --> 00:46:13,598
but they are not upregulated in the

1113
00:46:12,119 --> 00:46:16,240
presence of the fungus and phosphate

1114
00:46:13,599 --> 00:46:19,800
deficient conditions and if you look you

1115
00:46:16,239 --> 00:46:22,959
know what do these genes encode they are

1116
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:25,880
strongly enriched in genes that are

1117
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:29,400
involved in innate immune responses so

1118
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:32,358
it looks as if arabidopsis activates

1119
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:34,039
defense gene expression um and innate

1120
00:46:32,358 --> 00:46:36,000
immune responses to the fungus

1121
00:46:34,039 --> 00:46:37,679
specifically only in the presence of

1122
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:40,440
sufficient phosphate but not under

1123
00:46:37,679 --> 00:46:42,598
phosphate deficiency and there was one

1124
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:45,679
cluster of genes from these cluster n

1125
00:46:42,599 --> 00:46:47,720
genes that attracted it specifically uh

1126
00:46:45,679 --> 00:46:49,639
because these are genes that encode for

1127
00:46:47,719 --> 00:46:51,639
indol and tryptophane metabolic

1128
00:46:49,639 --> 00:46:53,480
processes and there's a particular

1129
00:46:51,639 --> 00:46:56,480
reason for this because several years

1130
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:58,559
ago we had shown that this class of

1131
00:46:56,480 --> 00:47:01,079
compound s and and and these genes

1132
00:46:58,559 --> 00:47:03,519
encode indog glucosinolates a class of

1133
00:47:01,079 --> 00:47:05,760
secondary metabolites in arabidopsis

1134
00:47:03,519 --> 00:47:09,318
that these confer potent immune

1135
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:11,880
responses to fungal pathogens so we

1136
00:47:09,318 --> 00:47:14,920
wondered what would happen if we deplete

1137
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:17,280
arabidopsis plants of the biosynthesis

1138
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:19,880
of these uh secondary metabolites and

1139
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:22,160
you can do that in arabidopsis by uh

1140
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:25,280
using a double mutant of these p450

1141
00:47:22,159 --> 00:47:27,199
genes and the result is shown here so

1142
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:29,480
these plants in the absence of the

1143
00:47:27,199 --> 00:47:31,118
pathogens they just grow like wild type

1144
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:34,000
plants there there's no effect but then

1145
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:36,960
if you add the beneficial fungus it

1146
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:39,639
kills the host so now in the absence of

1147
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:42,119
these compounds The Beneficial call it a

1148
00:47:39,639 --> 00:47:44,838
triom toel fungus becomes a

1149
00:47:42,119 --> 00:47:48,920
pathogen so I think what this tells us

1150
00:47:44,838 --> 00:47:51,119
is that these secondary metabolites that

1151
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:54,119
have been proposed to have antibiotic

1152
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:56,318
functions again pathogens that they may

1153
00:47:54,119 --> 00:47:58,519
have novel functions and they they

1154
00:47:56,318 --> 00:48:00,719
clearly are necessary for the

1155
00:47:58,519 --> 00:48:03,039
establishment of an interaction with a

1156
00:48:00,719 --> 00:48:05,399
beneficial root Associated fungus and I

1157
00:48:03,039 --> 00:48:07,920
think that's somewhat um um

1158
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:09,838
thought-provoking so end of data slides

1159
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:11,440
I think I'd like to zoom out and just

1160
00:48:09,838 --> 00:48:14,838
like to put this work a little bit into

1161
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:16,838
a broader uh context um uh so I think

1162
00:48:14,838 --> 00:48:20,039
what this slide really shows is the

1163
00:48:16,838 --> 00:48:21,558
increase of uh word fertilizer

1164
00:48:20,039 --> 00:48:23,838
consumption and I showed you that this

1165
00:48:21,559 --> 00:48:27,079
beneficial fungus really provides

1166
00:48:23,838 --> 00:48:29,599
phosphate um to its host and help the

1167
00:48:27,079 --> 00:48:32,160
plant to mobilize phosphate from soil

1168
00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:35,400
and it's also clear that phosphate is

1169
00:48:32,159 --> 00:48:37,358
just one of the three nutrients um uh

1170
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:40,800
that we use in synthetic fertilizers

1171
00:48:37,358 --> 00:48:43,519
next to nitrate and to potassium and

1172
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:45,480
it's it's also clear that these um

1173
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:49,519
synthetic fertilizers help to feed the

1174
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:51,199
world roughly 50% of the plant

1175
00:48:49,519 --> 00:48:54,440
productivity is due to the use of

1176
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:56,239
fertilizers and 50% is plant genetics

1177
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:58,358
but you I guess you will also agree with

1178
00:48:56,239 --> 00:49:00,439
me that the the excessive use of

1179
00:48:58,358 --> 00:49:03,039
fertilizers has detrimental effects on

1180
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:04,760
the environment and and in addition you

1181
00:49:03,039 --> 00:49:06,558
know Global Sources for phosphate in

1182
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:09,960
fertilizers are limited and this

1183
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:12,640
certainly fuels interest in isolating

1184
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:13,599
novel biofertilizer microbes from from

1185
00:49:12,639 --> 00:49:16,199
the plant

1186
00:49:13,599 --> 00:49:18,039
microbot so but leaving apart this

1187
00:49:16,199 --> 00:49:20,159
translational aspect I hope I've been

1188
00:49:18,039 --> 00:49:22,318
able to convince you that really what

1189
00:49:20,159 --> 00:49:25,199
plant microbot research is about it's

1190
00:49:22,318 --> 00:49:27,079
about studying interactions between soil

1191
00:49:25,199 --> 00:49:30,639
microbial communities and plants

1192
00:49:27,079 --> 00:49:33,119
genotype and I think this offers unique

1193
00:49:30,639 --> 00:49:36,598
possibility it creates new interfaces

1194
00:49:33,119 --> 00:49:38,160
between um uh disciplines of of of

1195
00:49:36,599 --> 00:49:39,680
science that are traditionally more

1196
00:49:38,159 --> 00:49:42,598
separated you know terrestrial

1197
00:49:39,679 --> 00:49:44,960
microbiology plant science geochemistry

1198
00:49:42,599 --> 00:49:47,559
and and and soil science so I think this

1199
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:51,000
is really where we operate and where I

1200
00:49:47,559 --> 00:49:54,720
would like to yeah to extend our work

1201
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:59,880
over the next 5 10 well let's see how

1202
00:49:54,719 --> 00:50:01,598
long but um yeah um okay so um I've come

1203
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:03,880
to the conclusion most important slide

1204
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:05,640
is really to acknowledge a fantastic

1205
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:09,358
underground group I think I've mentioned

1206
00:50:05,639 --> 00:50:10,920
most of them in passing um uh I should

1207
00:50:09,358 --> 00:50:13,199
perhaps really give credit to the

1208
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:15,920
computational scientist Ruben Garo or

1209
00:50:13,199 --> 00:50:17,838
Gary shrinivas and of course to our

1210
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:19,599
collaborator on the leaf microt Daniel

1211
00:50:17,838 --> 00:50:21,679
Miller and Julia fold from the eth

1212
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:23,400
surich and a number of f funding

1213
00:50:21,679 --> 00:50:25,798
agencies and then we have a number of

1214
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:27,680
other external collaborators Ellis

1215
00:50:25,798 --> 00:50:29,519
mccardy Julie for hold I mentioned

1216
00:50:27,679 --> 00:50:31,318
before Jeff dangle of course Simona rut

1217
00:50:29,519 --> 00:50:34,750
toy and cor

1218
00:50:31,318 --> 00:50:38,230
Peterson so um thanks very much for your

1219
00:50:34,750 --> 00:50:38,230
[Applause]

1220
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:47,318
attention oo well in the in the

1221
00:50:45,199 --> 00:50:48,118
manuscript of course we Shi away from

1222
00:50:47,318 --> 00:50:50,199
any

1223
00:50:48,119 --> 00:50:53,280
mechanistic um interpretation but

1224
00:50:50,199 --> 00:50:56,358
actually if you if you um look into the

1225
00:50:53,280 --> 00:51:00,519
literature Frank deso actually uh in the

1226
00:50:56,358 --> 00:51:03,960
US has done experiments with gfp tagged

1227
00:51:00,519 --> 00:51:06,759
risia um where he had shown inoculated

1228
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:09,960
them to rise roots and he had shown that

1229
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:13,079
these Rovia then over time uh can be

1230
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:15,559
recovered um from above ground Parts

1231
00:51:13,079 --> 00:51:18,920
again how they get there whether they

1232
00:51:15,559 --> 00:51:21,319
you know are um whether they make it via

1233
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:24,358
the transpiration stream or outside you

1234
00:51:21,318 --> 00:51:27,199
know on the root surface on the um root

1235
00:51:24,358 --> 00:51:31,239
surface that is entirely unclear here

1236
00:51:27,199 --> 00:51:34,239
but I think um the other way um so from

1237
00:51:31,239 --> 00:51:36,318
leaves back to Roots um I think this

1238
00:51:34,239 --> 00:51:38,759
happens well more or less on a daily

1239
00:51:36,318 --> 00:51:41,639
basis because every rain shower you know

1240
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:44,160
will wash off uh Leaf Associated

1241
00:51:41,639 --> 00:51:46,679
bacteria then so it's definitely

1242
00:51:44,159 --> 00:51:48,598
possible that uh Leaf associate bacteria

1243
00:51:46,679 --> 00:51:50,960
makes it into the soil and then Rec

1244
00:51:48,599 --> 00:51:55,039
colonizes the root so this is I think

1245
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:58,358
really a yeah a connected system of of

1246
00:51:55,039 --> 00:52:02,000
leaf and root Associated bacteria

1247
00:51:58,358 --> 00:52:03,960
no no no no actually in this in this um

1248
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:07,838
closed compartment system in the keline

1249
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:11,519
clay We water them initially um and we

1250
00:52:07,838 --> 00:52:14,039
make sure um we water them at um um

1251
00:52:11,519 --> 00:52:16,519
maximum water retention capacity and

1252
00:52:14,039 --> 00:52:19,358
then we have to rewater them once so we

1253
00:52:16,519 --> 00:52:22,318
open the magenta boxes under clean bench

1254
00:52:19,358 --> 00:52:24,519
and then carefully add sterile water

1255
00:52:22,318 --> 00:52:28,719
just to avoid any

1256
00:52:24,519 --> 00:52:30,519
perturbation um yeah I think that's but

1257
00:52:28,719 --> 00:52:34,679
it's a it's a good

1258
00:52:30,519 --> 00:52:36,920
point ah Ellen yes so with your uh

1259
00:52:34,679 --> 00:52:40,440
caline clay

1260
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:43,519
uh population shift experim if instead

1261
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:46,039
of using uh

1262
00:52:43,519 --> 00:52:49,239
PL extracts

1263
00:52:46,039 --> 00:52:52,798
or a plastic FL or

1264
00:52:49,239 --> 00:52:55,919
other you see similar shifts in the

1265
00:52:52,798 --> 00:52:58,239
population whole we haven't done those

1266
00:52:55,920 --> 00:53:00,559
experiments because we always feel that

1267
00:52:58,239 --> 00:53:04,519
it is important to do experiments in a

1268
00:53:00,559 --> 00:53:06,160
whole organism context um but I think um

1269
00:53:04,519 --> 00:53:09,318
somewhat similar experiments have been

1270
00:53:06,159 --> 00:53:12,679
done by NOAA here in the US and he used

1271
00:53:09,318 --> 00:53:15,440
um he implanted organic carbon sources

1272
00:53:12,679 --> 00:53:18,078
into unplanted soil and it's it's very

1273
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:21,358
clear that organic carbon is the most

1274
00:53:18,079 --> 00:53:24,760
important rate limiting step for uh

1275
00:53:21,358 --> 00:53:27,318
growth of soil born bacteria so in

1276
00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:29,920
unplanted soil organic car is always

1277
00:53:27,318 --> 00:53:33,440
rate limiting and so I think one of our

1278
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:36,318
hypothesis indeed is that this whole

1279
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:39,159
process of community establishment in is

1280
00:53:36,318 --> 00:53:42,480
initiated by organic carbons that are

1281
00:53:39,159 --> 00:53:44,598
released um bya root exudation and that

1282
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:48,000
serves you know initiates a substrate

1283
00:53:44,599 --> 00:53:50,359
driven Community establishment process

1284
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:53,239
but this is you know hand waving at the

1285
00:53:50,358 --> 00:53:55,440
moment but I I think it becomes

1286
00:53:53,239 --> 00:53:58,279
experimentally tractable

1287
00:53:55,440 --> 00:54:01,318
now yes please that

1288
00:53:58,280 --> 00:54:02,720
se is beneficial to the plant but only

1289
00:54:01,318 --> 00:54:04,759
if the plant has certain secondary

1290
00:54:02,719 --> 00:54:06,480
metabolics can you say more about how

1291
00:54:04,760 --> 00:54:10,680
that works with those

1292
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:10,679
metabolites without it they become it

1293
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:16,400
becom um yeah I think these are really

1294
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:20,240
important questions actually it's um I I

1295
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:22,358
showed only a small part of the data um

1296
00:54:20,239 --> 00:54:27,199
and maybe

1297
00:54:22,358 --> 00:54:29,480
maybe um yes so for example you know

1298
00:54:27,199 --> 00:54:31,919
this is it becomes a pathogen if we

1299
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:33,880
deplete all of these Branch Pathways

1300
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:36,119
we've of course also genetically

1301
00:54:33,880 --> 00:54:39,318
depleted this Branch pathway the pen two

1302
00:54:36,119 --> 00:54:41,680
Mutant and then you specifically impair

1303
00:54:39,318 --> 00:54:45,000
the plant growth promotion but the plant

1304
00:54:41,679 --> 00:54:48,358
is still doing well so one hypothesis is

1305
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:51,400
that actually these metabolic products

1306
00:54:48,358 --> 00:54:53,159
may have yeah even a signaling role in

1307
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:56,119
growth promotion that's one

1308
00:54:53,159 --> 00:54:59,440
possibilities um we know when we deplete

1309
00:54:56,119 --> 00:55:02,880
um chin production there's no effect

1310
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:04,599
whatsoever so maybe one interpretation

1311
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:07,519
is that these secondary

1312
00:55:04,599 --> 00:55:10,318
metabolites um constrain the growth or

1313
00:55:07,519 --> 00:55:13,599
limit the growth of the fungus to a

1314
00:55:10,318 --> 00:55:17,000
certain extent and then if you uh

1315
00:55:13,599 --> 00:55:18,880
deplete them then um the fun there's

1316
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:20,599
excessive growth and that's consistent

1317
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:25,519
with the fact that at least in the sub

1318
00:55:20,599 --> 00:55:28,160
79 B2 B3 mutant um you know there's um

1319
00:55:25,519 --> 00:55:30,599
uh things six or Sevenfold increased

1320
00:55:28,159 --> 00:55:33,078
fungal biomass compared to wild typ

1321
00:55:30,599 --> 00:55:35,240
plants so it looks as if the fungal

1322
00:55:33,079 --> 00:55:39,280
colonization is uncontrolled in the

1323
00:55:35,239 --> 00:55:39,279
absence of of these secondary

1324
00:55:39,599 --> 00:55:46,119
metabolites yes yes because what we've

1325
00:55:42,519 --> 00:55:49,679
used um we've used a reporter line U for

1326
00:55:46,119 --> 00:55:53,160
plasma membrane Mar protein quorin and

1327
00:55:49,679 --> 00:55:56,759
so we can clearly see that the high that

1328
00:55:53,159 --> 00:56:00,920
grow inside root cells um are surround

1329
00:55:56,760 --> 00:56:05,240
it um by a plasma membrane we're quite

1330
00:56:00,920 --> 00:56:05,240
confident about that yes and have

1331
00:56:05,719 --> 00:56:13,558
you no not yet no not yet yeah we're

1332
00:56:10,838 --> 00:56:17,759
testing of course many many more um

1333
00:56:13,559 --> 00:56:19,599
mutants in this pathway um yeah no I

1334
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:22,599
think there's much more that can be

1335
00:56:19,599 --> 00:56:22,599
tested I

1336
00:56:22,639 --> 00:56:29,519
agree well um I haven't done those

1337
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:32,519
experiments first of all um but we've

1338
00:56:29,519 --> 00:56:34,639
taken indeed um we've taken

1339
00:56:32,519 --> 00:56:37,079
cross-section through different regions

1340
00:56:34,639 --> 00:56:41,279
of the root and we see colonization

1341
00:56:37,079 --> 00:56:45,798
really from um yeah from almost from the

1342
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:49,400
root tip to um uh highly differentiated

1343
00:56:45,798 --> 00:56:51,400
rots including secondary uh growth so I

1344
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:55,599
think there's no we cannot really

1345
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:58,240
pinpoint at the moment uh a particular

1346
00:56:55,599 --> 00:57:00,280
um development stage of the root where

1347
00:56:58,239 --> 00:57:01,919
this fungus would establish these

1348
00:57:00,280 --> 00:57:04,559
associations I think this is actually a

1349
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:06,960
disadvantage of the system you know the

1350
00:57:04,559 --> 00:57:10,200
uh it's unlike in microa where you have

1351
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:13,119
these beautifully uh abascal you know

1352
00:57:10,199 --> 00:57:16,759
this is really um yeah the fungus is is

1353
00:57:13,119 --> 00:57:19,559
ramifying throughout the root cortex and

1354
00:57:16,760 --> 00:57:22,119
occasionally even makes it into a into

1355
00:57:19,559 --> 00:57:25,400
the central cylinder but that is really

1356
00:57:22,119 --> 00:57:28,079
only um on rare occasions but it's

1357
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:33,519
mainly found in the in the root

1358
00:57:28,079 --> 00:57:37,240
cortex oh yes ah so this very important

1359
00:57:33,519 --> 00:57:40,559
so we thought if this were true it's too

1360
00:57:37,239 --> 00:57:44,479
bad I don't have the slide with me so

1361
00:57:40,559 --> 00:57:47,519
um we tested arabidopsis relatives and

1362
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:51,000
for example kadam huta which is a

1363
00:57:47,519 --> 00:57:54,559
relative of taliana but kadam huta is

1364
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:57,519
naturally lacks the capacity for calaxin

1365
00:57:54,559 --> 00:57:59,960
production and um I mentioned before

1366
00:57:57,519 --> 00:58:02,440
that if we genetically impair CX in

1367
00:57:59,960 --> 00:58:05,480
production arabidopsis we see retained

1368
00:58:02,440 --> 00:58:08,679
growth promotion and so in kadam huta

1369
00:58:05,480 --> 00:58:12,240
also this fungus colonizes arabidopsis

1370
00:58:08,679 --> 00:58:14,919
and promotes growth but when we tested

1371
00:58:12,239 --> 00:58:18,639
capsella rubella capsella rubella is one

1372
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:20,760
of the very few brasic Casia that has

1373
00:58:18,639 --> 00:58:23,879
lost the capacity for indog

1374
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:27,240
glucosinolate production then capsella

1375
00:58:23,880 --> 00:58:30,000
rubella looks like a SI 17 B2 B3 double

1376
00:58:27,239 --> 00:58:33,598
mutant so it kills capsella and this is

1377
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:36,519
relevant because in Spain capsella

1378
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:39,079
rubella and arabidopsis talana share the

1379
00:58:36,519 --> 00:58:41,759
same habitat so I think one of our

1380
00:58:39,079 --> 00:58:44,880
hypothesis is that these secondary

1381
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:47,799
metabolites are actually a Host range

1382
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:52,160
determinant so um yeah at least that's

1383
00:58:47,798 --> 00:58:53,920
what the data tell us so far yes yes now

1384
00:58:52,159 --> 00:58:57,000
I think this is one of the central

1385
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:59,798
questions you know how to

1386
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:02,039
um what's a minimum complexity

1387
00:58:59,798 --> 00:59:04,519
Community what

1388
00:59:02,039 --> 00:59:06,480
determines uh the taxonomic structure

1389
00:59:04,519 --> 00:59:07,960
this highly reproducible taxonomic

1390
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:11,119
structure of the

1391
00:59:07,960 --> 00:59:13,358
community um and and of course now

1392
00:59:11,119 --> 00:59:15,440
having access to this culture collection

1393
00:59:13,358 --> 00:59:17,639
enables us to test this you're

1394
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:20,079
absolutely right you know if you have 26

1395
00:59:17,639 --> 00:59:22,598
Root Drive bacteria the number of

1396
00:59:20,079 --> 00:59:25,079
combinations you can test is beyond

1397
00:59:22,599 --> 00:59:28,920
possibility so you need to have some

1398
00:59:25,079 --> 00:59:31,079
strategic plan um one possibility is you

1399
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:33,119
can deplete particular taxonomic

1400
00:59:31,079 --> 00:59:36,318
lineages let's say you take away the

1401
00:59:33,119 --> 00:59:38,358
Proto bacteria um another one is you you

1402
00:59:36,318 --> 00:59:41,318
can take away the bacteriodes that that

1403
00:59:38,358 --> 00:59:44,880
would be one way another possibility is

1404
00:59:41,318 --> 00:59:47,279
it's realistic you can test in binary

1405
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:50,200
interactions um interactions between the

1406
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:52,960
bacteria themselves so that is a

1407
00:59:50,199 --> 00:59:55,480
possible and this is one route that that

1408
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:58,000
we are pursuing because we believe that

1409
00:59:55,480 --> 01:00:00,358
antagonis mytic interactions so bacteria

1410
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:02,480
bacteria interactions are very important

1411
01:00:00,358 --> 01:00:04,159
for microbol

1412
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:06,798
establishment but that's these are

1413
01:00:04,159 --> 01:00:09,159
ongoing but very important

1414
01:00:06,798 --> 01:00:11,599
experiments yeah we do experimental

1415
01:00:09,159 --> 01:00:14,838
evolution in the lab now so we use our

1416
01:00:11,599 --> 01:00:17,000
culture collection and then we apply a

1417
01:00:14,838 --> 01:00:19,440
defined nutrient stress for example low

1418
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:24,358
phosphate and then we incubate them with

1419
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:26,838
the bacteria then we um isolate um the

1420
01:00:24,358 --> 01:00:28,880
synthetic community um and then we

1421
01:00:26,838 --> 01:00:30,480
reinoculate for a second time and we're

1422
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:34,440
now I think at generation six or

1423
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:35,639
Generation 7 um on the host side and um

1424
01:00:34,440 --> 01:00:37,559
the bacterial of course these are

1425
01:00:35,639 --> 01:00:39,639
thousands and thousands of bacterial

1426
01:00:37,559 --> 01:00:41,519
generations and so this is really I

1427
01:00:39,639 --> 01:00:45,199
don't know whether this will work but

1428
01:00:41,519 --> 01:00:47,038
that's one idea that you can apply um

1429
01:00:45,199 --> 01:00:49,919
experimental Evolution strategies and

1430
01:00:47,039 --> 01:00:54,640
you can test whether there's a realtime

1431
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:57,159
Evolution um to yeah support plant

1432
01:00:54,639 --> 01:01:01,078
growth but then

1433
01:00:57,159 --> 01:01:04,000
that's um yeah that's something for the

1434
01:01:01,079 --> 01:01:06,359
future yes that's another I think this

1435
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:08,480
is you know this is why um you know we

1436
01:01:06,358 --> 01:01:11,199
tend to say in Cologne you know we are

1437
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:13,039
facing the candy shop problem you know

1438
01:01:11,199 --> 01:01:15,759
more or less you can start so many

1439
01:01:13,039 --> 01:01:18,720
things now that it's um and if you start

1440
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:21,119
too many things you can feel really bad

1441
01:01:18,719 --> 01:01:25,598
so I think one needs to prioritize very

1442
01:01:21,119 --> 01:01:28,640
very um carefully um so so so remind me

1443
01:01:25,599 --> 01:01:31,359
again that the the the resilience of yes

1444
01:01:28,639 --> 01:01:33,558
yes yes yes absolutely so this is

1445
01:01:31,358 --> 01:01:35,358
something that we are now um that's a

1446
01:01:33,559 --> 01:01:37,319
project that we've started actually in a

1447
01:01:35,358 --> 01:01:42,239
collaboration with shenan he not far

1448
01:01:37,318 --> 01:01:44,440
from here Michigan um we now um we do

1449
01:01:42,239 --> 01:01:47,439
barcoding of our bacterial culture

1450
01:01:44,440 --> 01:01:50,519
collection with a tn7 you know you can

1451
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:53,039
you can barcode them and then we can add

1452
01:01:50,519 --> 01:01:55,440
because the fundamental question about

1453
01:01:53,039 --> 01:01:57,559
resilience of the community is so if you

1454
01:01:55,440 --> 01:01:59,200
I I think the the major function of a

1455
01:01:57,559 --> 01:02:00,798
community is that it's more than the sum

1456
01:01:59,199 --> 01:02:02,639
of the parts so there are emerging

1457
01:02:00,798 --> 01:02:04,880
properties that you cannot explain you

1458
01:02:02,639 --> 01:02:09,118
know on the basis of the individuals and

1459
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:14,079
I think a a a very popular um uh theory

1460
01:02:09,119 --> 01:02:18,200
in in um um ecology is that a community

1461
01:02:14,079 --> 01:02:21,839
whatever community of organism um is um

1462
01:02:18,199 --> 01:02:25,399
resistant to invasion of um alien

1463
01:02:21,838 --> 01:02:28,679
members so um what we do now with our

1464
01:02:25,400 --> 01:02:30,119
bar coded Root Drive bacteria that we

1465
01:02:28,679 --> 01:02:33,078
add them to a

1466
01:02:30,119 --> 01:02:35,760
preformed um root microbot of plants

1467
01:02:33,079 --> 01:02:38,920
grown in different soil types and then

1468
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:42,240
we can test their Invasion and

1469
01:02:38,920 --> 01:02:45,159
persistence so I think this is one way

1470
01:02:42,239 --> 01:02:48,558
uh we know this is a very rare event

1471
01:02:45,159 --> 01:02:50,358
that really a bacterium can intrude can

1472
01:02:48,559 --> 01:02:52,960
make it you know into a preformed

1473
01:02:50,358 --> 01:02:54,838
Community the molecular basis of this I

1474
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:56,679
think that is again it's years of

1475
01:02:54,838 --> 01:02:58,639
research ahead

1476
01:02:56,679 --> 01:03:01,318
but it's it's certainly something that

1477
01:02:58,639 --> 01:03:02,838
is of fundamental importance to

1478
01:03:01,318 --> 01:03:06,038
understand

1479
01:03:02,838 --> 01:03:08,159
um in it's I think it's in part it's

1480
01:03:06,039 --> 01:03:11,079
already you know during establishment of

1481
01:03:08,159 --> 01:03:13,759
these bacterial communities that um yeah

1482
01:03:11,079 --> 01:03:15,559
these bacteria must be competitive they

1483
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:18,079
must out compete all of their

1484
01:03:15,559 --> 01:03:20,119
competitors that are in the in the soil

1485
01:03:18,079 --> 01:03:23,119
zillions and zillions of bacteria so

1486
01:03:20,119 --> 01:03:26,480
they they must have a very high

1487
01:03:23,119 --> 01:03:28,960
competitiveness yes yes oh yeah the

1488
01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:31,599
these are again very important questions

1489
01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:34,720
so of course now we have um as I tried

1490
01:03:31,599 --> 01:03:36,640
to explain um our core culture

1491
01:03:34,719 --> 01:03:41,278
Collections and we have the whole genome

1492
01:03:36,639 --> 01:03:43,960
sequences one way to infer um functions

1493
01:03:41,278 --> 01:03:46,239
of the microbot is you use metagenomic

1494
01:03:43,960 --> 01:03:48,639
approaches but a major limitation of

1495
01:03:46,239 --> 01:03:51,679
metagenomic approaches is that only 20%

1496
01:03:48,639 --> 01:03:54,759
of the sequences could actually be um

1497
01:03:51,679 --> 01:03:57,519
annotated now um when we use our whole

1498
01:03:54,760 --> 01:04:00,160
genome sequencing is it looks like as if

1499
01:03:57,519 --> 01:04:01,960
you know the um the number of genes that

1500
01:04:00,159 --> 01:04:03,639
we can annotate on the basis of

1501
01:04:01,960 --> 01:04:06,079
metagenome approaches is really

1502
01:04:03,639 --> 01:04:07,759
dramatically U increases so I think I

1503
01:04:06,079 --> 01:04:10,519
hope that with the whole genome

1504
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:13,000
sequences that our future metag genome

1505
01:04:10,519 --> 01:04:15,960
um uh approaches will become more

1506
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:19,039
meaningful uh that's one thing but I

1507
01:04:15,960 --> 01:04:22,318
also believe that

1508
01:04:19,039 --> 01:04:25,039
um or at least one hypothesis is that

1509
01:04:22,318 --> 01:04:28,119
the adaptation or the the the functional

1510
01:04:25,039 --> 01:04:29,839
adaptation is not in the core genome but

1511
01:04:28,119 --> 01:04:32,920
it's in the accessory or in the Pang

1512
01:04:29,838 --> 01:04:35,798
Genome of of these bacterial communities

1513
01:04:32,920 --> 01:04:38,480
and this may explain why we have this

1514
01:04:35,798 --> 01:04:40,400
highly reproducible taxonomic structure

1515
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:42,960
and irrespective of whether we grow you

1516
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:44,798
know plants you know in the US or in

1517
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:46,440
Europe or in Asia or whatsoever we

1518
01:04:44,798 --> 01:04:48,679
always end up with the same taxonomic

1519
01:04:46,440 --> 01:04:51,039
structure but um of course looking at

1520
01:04:48,679 --> 01:04:53,679
the whole genome level there may be

1521
01:04:51,039 --> 01:04:55,920
signals of biogeography and there may be

1522
01:04:53,679 --> 01:04:57,558
adaptations to particular environments

1523
01:04:55,920 --> 01:05:01,880
that's that's my

1524
01:04:57,559 --> 01:05:04,319
hypothesis um yeah and and so again it's

1525
01:05:01,880 --> 01:05:07,920
it's it's a long-term question that I

1526
01:05:04,318 --> 01:05:10,480
think through um increased availability

1527
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:12,240
of whole genome sequences and hopefully

1528
01:05:10,480 --> 01:05:16,838
many many more systematic culture

1529
01:05:12,239 --> 01:05:16,838
collections we can address this

1530
01:05:17,599 --> 01:05:22,480
systematically let thank Paul again
