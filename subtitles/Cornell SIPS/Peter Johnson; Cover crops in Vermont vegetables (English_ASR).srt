1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,940
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:07,439
University hi everybody my name is Pete

3
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:10,170
Johnson I have a farm called Pete

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:14,099
screens in northern Vermont zone 3 zone

5
00:00:10,169 --> 00:00:17,550
4 we're way up there started as a tiny

6
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:19,289
little 2 acre you know half acre farm 20

7
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:21,118
years ago now

8
00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:23,160
my experience with cover cropping up to

9
00:00:21,118 --> 00:00:25,109
about 4 years ago was sort of typical

10
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:26,579
vegetable farm you know throwing some

11
00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:29,910
rides throwing some buckwheat here and

12
00:00:26,579 --> 00:00:31,768
there and then I decided to go and find

13
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:33,689
enough land to have three or four times

14
00:00:31,768 --> 00:00:37,890
as much land as we crop on we crop about

15
00:00:33,689 --> 00:00:40,890
100 acres and we have about 400 acres in

16
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:44,280
rotation now of varying quality some of

17
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:49,890
its not great but just jumped into this

18
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:52,010
big experiment of trying to learn about

19
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:54,210
technology

20
00:00:52,009 --> 00:00:55,710
just learning about cover crops in my in

21
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:57,239
my talk will just basically show the

22
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:59,340
experiments that I've been involved with

23
00:00:57,238 --> 00:01:01,500
for three or four years now different

24
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:04,650
pieces of equipment on different cover

25
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:06,000
crops things that I've learned things

26
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:08,219
that I realized I know almost nothing

27
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,140
about and have a ton more to learn about

28
00:01:08,219 --> 00:01:13,920
it now way more fun for me than growing

29
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:15,180
vegetables it's super interesting the

30
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,070
growing of the vegetables is sort of

31
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:19,229
just a proof that you did a decent job

32
00:01:17,069 --> 00:01:20,879
with with the prep time we're also

33
00:01:19,228 --> 00:01:24,359
trying we use a lot of raw chicken

34
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:26,969
manure and other bulk soil amendments

35
00:01:24,359 --> 00:01:29,489
and we're trying to get our soils fully

36
00:01:26,969 --> 00:01:32,400
up to speed ready to roll in the cover

37
00:01:29,489 --> 00:01:34,949
cropping period before vegetables start

38
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,540
and that's still a couple years away

39
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:38,820
from really being there but it's the I'm

40
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:40,439
seeing lots of good promise for that

41
00:01:38,819 --> 00:01:42,779
we've taken a lot of land that was sort

42
00:01:40,438 --> 00:01:45,179
of real old plate out land brought it

43
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:46,890
back and two or three years of lots of

44
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:50,340
fertility lots of cover cropping has

45
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:52,890
really been successful is this is this

46
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:55,670
slide showing it must be okay can you I

47
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:57,629
how do I get back at the beginning again

48
00:01:55,670 --> 00:02:00,228
so we're going to go at a certain pace

49
00:01:57,629 --> 00:02:00,228
apparently

50
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:05,439
so I started off thinking I'm gonna do

51
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:08,590
I'm gonna do like two years sod it's

52
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:09,699
gonna be my program legumes grasses and

53
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:13,870
I did a bunch of that for the first

54
00:02:09,699 --> 00:02:15,489
couple years this is an example of that

55
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:21,370
thank you

56
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:23,770
lots of red clover all sigh clover the

57
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:26,920
best grasses for us seemed to be fescues

58
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:29,110
real aggressive growers but I'm not

59
00:02:26,919 --> 00:02:31,239
finding that after this my soil has

60
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:33,220
really transformed the ways I want it to

61
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:37,450
it doesn't seem like a gain enough like

62
00:02:33,219 --> 00:02:39,520
bulk organic material some cases we've

63
00:02:37,449 --> 00:02:43,449
been hanging this some cases we've been

64
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:45,790
mowing it back in in all cases I haven't

65
00:02:43,449 --> 00:02:47,979
been super impressed by the results so

66
00:02:45,789 --> 00:02:49,840
now I'm basically doing that with land

67
00:02:47,979 --> 00:02:51,479
that's really got some issues needs to

68
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:56,170
be locked away for a while

69
00:02:51,479 --> 00:02:58,810
this is buckwheat this is a mix that we

70
00:02:56,169 --> 00:03:03,549
had this summer sunflowers buckwheat

71
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:06,849
there were some peas in there whole grab

72
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:08,890
bag oats some plant or more this is

73
00:03:06,849 --> 00:03:11,859
perhaps the most important slide this is

74
00:03:08,889 --> 00:03:13,298
300 pounds an acre of oats and fern

75
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:16,450
talked about tried-and-true stuff

76
00:03:13,299 --> 00:03:18,219
earlier my hot weather you know sue Dax

77
00:03:16,449 --> 00:03:19,509
things like that hardly grew for me this

78
00:03:18,219 --> 00:03:19,900
summer it was so cold and wet where we

79
00:03:19,509 --> 00:03:22,659
are

80
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:25,239
oh it's day in day out I can get to

81
00:03:22,659 --> 00:03:27,519
crank 300 pounds an acre no matter how

82
00:03:25,239 --> 00:03:29,920
we the field is I basically get a clean

83
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:31,480
stand every time and that's super

84
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:33,789
important that's probably the most

85
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:36,280
important factor for me in what I choose

86
00:03:33,789 --> 00:03:39,569
to you feel free to ask questions at any

87
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:41,890
point because this is a just a grab bag

88
00:03:39,569 --> 00:03:45,359
so we're going to do more and more of

89
00:03:41,889 --> 00:03:48,099
you know cheap seed high high rates a

90
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:52,060
whole bunch of organic matter production

91
00:03:48,099 --> 00:03:55,329
in a short period of time this is a rye

92
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:56,140
vet that was knocked down and that's

93
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:59,440
what it looked like before we knock it

94
00:03:56,139 --> 00:04:00,548
down we're gonna still stuff this spring

95
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:05,709
for the first time we had a no-till

96
00:04:00,549 --> 00:04:08,049
drill it was has struggles doing it

97
00:04:05,709 --> 00:04:10,030
without having some weeds in there and

98
00:04:08,049 --> 00:04:12,060
made me kind of think it's not really

99
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:14,530
going to be our future necessarily

100
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:16,269
because just a little bit of established

101
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:18,100
we'd from the previous crop really

102
00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:20,350
becomes something serious in the next

103
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:23,669
crop we played around at caliente

104
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:27,189
mustard this year just aiming at weed

105
00:04:23,668 --> 00:04:29,199
killing weed seeds I'm not sure if it

106
00:04:27,189 --> 00:04:31,990
worked well I'll show you the regulator

107
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:34,329
that we used to incorporate it

108
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:39,460
it was difficult without doing a really

109
00:04:34,329 --> 00:04:41,529
careful trial to tell I don't know what

110
00:04:39,459 --> 00:04:44,409
that is that's my farm down there in the

111
00:04:41,529 --> 00:04:46,509
valley Craftsbury

112
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:49,090
it's half an hour south of the Canadian

113
00:04:46,509 --> 00:04:51,730
border in the middle of the state this

114
00:04:49,089 --> 00:04:56,649
is the mix of I was telling John Paul

115
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:58,600
earlier I son hamp this summer it got

116
00:04:56,649 --> 00:04:59,069
about 8 inches tall it's in here

117
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:02,379
somewhere

118
00:04:59,069 --> 00:05:04,930
I was really excited you don't see this

119
00:05:02,379 --> 00:05:06,939
huge massive legume and it's just in

120
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:08,470
cool wet conditions that just didn't do

121
00:05:06,939 --> 00:05:12,459
anything that's me pointing to a sunhemp

122
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:15,190
plant down down there so it's it's

123
00:05:12,459 --> 00:05:16,719
really interesting how something that

124
00:05:15,189 --> 00:05:19,360
could be awesome one year especially in

125
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:25,419
a climate like mine is not so great some

126
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:29,889
other time there's some pictures here to

127
00:05:25,418 --> 00:05:33,549
show how even this great high seed rate

128
00:05:29,889 --> 00:05:34,659
mix like this there is pigweed there's a

129
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:38,650
pygmy plant right in the middle there

130
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:40,810
and that's a serious problem and that's

131
00:05:38,649 --> 00:05:43,839
you know in a rotation like I'm working

132
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:45,399
on it I really can't have that I'll show

133
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:47,889
some tools later that we're using to try

134
00:05:45,399 --> 00:05:51,519
to prevent that it seems to me like with

135
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:54,519
mixes I have a lot to learn about the

136
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:56,379
species composition the rate the timing

137
00:05:54,519 --> 00:06:00,129
what time of year it is to make sure

138
00:05:56,379 --> 00:06:02,288
that doesn't happen here's um a place

139
00:06:00,129 --> 00:06:04,959
that was no-till knocked down right at

140
00:06:02,288 --> 00:06:07,149
seated into it it's trying to show that

141
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:09,579
there's some weeds in there we actually

142
00:06:07,149 --> 00:06:12,489
use buckwheat a lot in the summer like

143
00:06:09,579 --> 00:06:14,139
wolves will seed a sod crop grass and

144
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:16,240
legume right through the summer and

145
00:06:14,139 --> 00:06:18,849
we'll use buckwheat in them in a

146
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:20,259
midsummer period as a weed suppressant

147
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:22,870
for that it's much more effective than

148
00:06:20,259 --> 00:06:24,788
oats at that time of year

149
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:26,439
buckwheat sat about 40 pounds an acre

150
00:06:24,788 --> 00:06:26,779
will basically keep weeds from going to

151
00:06:26,439 --> 00:06:35,149
sea

152
00:06:26,779 --> 00:06:37,279
newly seeded side crop more pigweed in

153
00:06:35,149 --> 00:06:39,589
this mix that had stood ax and all these

154
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:43,069
things and this was carefully prepared

155
00:06:39,589 --> 00:06:47,750
land that was tine weeded before seeding

156
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:49,490
the cover crop some flowers a lot of fun

157
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:51,529
first year i grown them this year we had

158
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:54,019
lots and lots of tourists checking them

159
00:06:51,529 --> 00:06:55,279
out I like that biomass I'm seeing off

160
00:06:54,019 --> 00:06:57,529
it

161
00:06:55,279 --> 00:07:00,949
the seed is cheap if you buy birdseed

162
00:06:57,529 --> 00:07:06,319
rather than you know sunflower seed seed

163
00:07:00,949 --> 00:07:08,479
and germination seem to be good this is

164
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:09,949
always the thing you got this stand you

165
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:12,680
look down in there you know this was a

166
00:07:09,949 --> 00:07:15,110
super weedy vegetable land had been kind

167
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:16,280
of abused for two or three years and you

168
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:17,720
got those weeds down there you're like

169
00:07:16,279 --> 00:07:20,599
okay what are they gonna do are they

170
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:23,270
going to make seeds or not and that's

171
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:26,120
the critical question and it really

172
00:07:23,269 --> 00:07:28,399
depends on how quickly things fill in

173
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:29,840
and cover in this case probably yes

174
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:33,379
because there's gum globe in there and

175
00:07:29,839 --> 00:07:37,579
it'll usually make seed wherever but in

176
00:07:33,379 --> 00:07:44,839
the 300 pounds acre of oats very very

177
00:07:37,579 --> 00:07:46,370
little maybe none this was a fun thing

178
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:48,168
we got this summer we've been trying to

179
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:51,009
do a mulching project for a number of

180
00:07:48,168 --> 00:07:56,060
years where we make round bales and then

181
00:07:51,009 --> 00:07:59,329
blow them onto vegetable plants yay tall

182
00:07:56,060 --> 00:08:02,030
and we've we've now played around four

183
00:07:59,329 --> 00:08:05,689
different round bale choppers and none

184
00:08:02,029 --> 00:08:09,859
of them cut the round bales quite short

185
00:08:05,689 --> 00:08:12,769
enough so my neighbor had this forest

186
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:16,069
chopper that we bought for 3,000 bucks

187
00:08:12,769 --> 00:08:18,168
and this was ride that's you know he ate

188
00:08:16,069 --> 00:08:19,819
all that we've kind of forgotten about

189
00:08:18,168 --> 00:08:21,978
and had to grow vegetables in this field

190
00:08:19,819 --> 00:08:23,149
and of course there's nothing you can do

191
00:08:21,978 --> 00:08:24,668
with it at that point doesn't matter how

192
00:08:23,149 --> 00:08:28,819
many times you've hair it

193
00:08:24,668 --> 00:08:30,649
so we mowed it with the hay mower and

194
00:08:28,819 --> 00:08:33,979
then chopped it and blew it over the

195
00:08:30,649 --> 00:08:36,889
field and I think we hit this stage just

196
00:08:33,979 --> 00:08:40,129
right it was you know fully in grain but

197
00:08:36,889 --> 00:08:41,870
still quite green and the fertility

198
00:08:40,129 --> 00:08:43,850
production from this for the vegetable

199
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:46,070
crop was really impressive and I don't

200
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:47,899
think it was from the veg because there

201
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:50,080
wasn't that much veg it was the Rye

202
00:08:47,899 --> 00:08:52,610
really released a lot of nutrients and

203
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:55,910
it was a fast step didn't take very long

204
00:08:52,610 --> 00:09:02,409
and that land was just ready to go and

205
00:08:55,909 --> 00:09:02,409
do great crops start into equipment we

206
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:10,610
know that was chopping wind rose but

207
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:14,690
we've what we've discovered now is that

208
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:17,629
when we're doing our our mulching we

209
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:20,510
have to forage chop and then spread that

210
00:09:17,629 --> 00:09:22,820
with a manure spreader so we take dry

211
00:09:20,509 --> 00:09:25,039
round bales or we take we take dry

212
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:26,750
windows forged chop them it's basically

213
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:28,039
a silage operation at this point and we

214
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:29,929
haven't quite figured out the details of

215
00:09:28,039 --> 00:09:32,120
that but that spreads really well with a

216
00:09:29,929 --> 00:09:33,979
manure spreader right over very small

217
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:37,340
vegetables cuz it's only an inch long

218
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:39,350
and it falls off at all everything we

219
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:41,360
were all the round bale choppers are all

220
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:45,950
two and a half inches plus and that's

221
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:48,019
just a bridges over the crops these this

222
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:51,050
is a new us we call it a speed disc

223
00:09:48,019 --> 00:09:53,019
formats a Czech company really slick

224
00:09:51,049 --> 00:09:55,939
tool we have a lot of rocks in our area

225
00:09:53,019 --> 00:09:58,490
we're constantly breaking gang bolts on

226
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:59,990
disc harrows this is the tool that's

227
00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:02,779
designed to be used at 9 miles an hour

228
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:06,500
it's very fast this is showing it

229
00:10:02,779 --> 00:10:09,589
incorporating two-year-old grass legume

230
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:11,690
sod that you know historically we would

231
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:14,870
moldboard plow

232
00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:16,910
three passes with this thing at 9 miles

233
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:18,950
an hour at different angles in the right

234
00:10:16,909 --> 00:10:21,289
conditions if the soils moist at the

235
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:24,740
right level and you can seed a cover

236
00:10:21,289 --> 00:10:26,299
crop into this three to four passes over

237
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:30,110
the course of three weeks and you can

238
00:10:26,299 --> 00:10:34,279
see vegetables so this has become sort

239
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:36,889
of a super critical tool for us we had a

240
00:10:34,279 --> 00:10:38,419
different version called a Lemkin this

241
00:10:36,889 --> 00:10:42,919
is much cheaper the parts are much

242
00:10:38,419 --> 00:10:45,439
cheaper the speed is tremendous when you

243
00:10:42,919 --> 00:10:49,159
have a lot of acres to cover and each

244
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:51,470
disc is individually as an individual

245
00:10:49,159 --> 00:10:52,809
spring on it so they just roll over

246
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:56,889
rocks with no

247
00:10:52,809 --> 00:10:58,359
no problem at all really long-term more

248
00:10:56,889 --> 00:11:01,509
established saw it takes some more

249
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:03,629
passes in three to four but still with

250
00:11:01,509 --> 00:11:07,389
the speed it's not a not a big deal

251
00:11:03,629 --> 00:11:09,370
we went and got a range rail with six

252
00:11:07,389 --> 00:11:10,659
inch spacing this year because we had

253
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:12,580
one that was seven and a half and it

254
00:11:10,659 --> 00:11:15,789
wasn't doing wasn't planting stuff close

255
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:18,089
enough this was a nice addition although

256
00:11:15,789 --> 00:11:23,079
I think we're gonna go to broadcasting I

257
00:11:18,089 --> 00:11:24,460
wish I get back up could you take me

258
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:30,180
back the bidding and that could shuttle

259
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:33,190
through again sorry that farm at Machine

260
00:11:30,179 --> 00:11:35,879
just gonna keep going no back to the

261
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:35,880
equipment part sorry

262
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:42,820
there yeah thank you so yeah I can't if

263
00:11:41,299 --> 00:11:45,740
I was smarter I could do that couldn't

264
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:47,600
so this cedar is not very useful that's

265
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:48,919
a cedar on there drops the seed right

266
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,800
here right behind the dish right before

267
00:11:48,919 --> 00:11:54,019
the rollers but it's way too small so we

268
00:11:51,799 --> 00:11:56,839
are looking at either pulling an air

269
00:11:54,019 --> 00:11:58,340
seeding cart behind this or having a

270
00:11:56,840 --> 00:12:00,129
much bigger air seeding tank on the

271
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:02,840
front three-point hitch of the tractor

272
00:12:00,129 --> 00:12:07,129
somehow to you know be able to carry at

273
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:08,360
least a ton of seed and I like the idea

274
00:12:07,129 --> 00:12:09,200
of this because I'm not going to have

275
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:11,120
rows at all

276
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:13,820
I'm gonna have a uniform distribution of

277
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:16,399
seed we we're demoing this and playing

278
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:19,220
around with it just to see if we liked

279
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:20,750
how it covered and it seemed like the

280
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:22,330
main concern is it likes to cover the

281
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:24,620
seat a little bit too deeply sometimes

282
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:28,100
but you could adjust the depth of these

283
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:30,710
discs with these rollers here it seems

284
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:33,830
like it has a lot of potential and we

285
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:35,960
can now be seating at 6 7 8 9 miles an

286
00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:39,980
hour rather than you know 5 with the

287
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:42,920
grain drill maybe 6 when you're covering

288
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:44,720
several hundred acres and doing

289
00:12:42,919 --> 00:12:49,360
sometimes multiple crops and the same

290
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:51,529
acres every year speed becomes important

291
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:54,080
so these things come with a variety of

292
00:12:51,529 --> 00:12:57,339
rollers this is a really heavy one that

293
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:57,340
packs the soil more

294
00:13:00,769 --> 00:13:07,129
main drill this is our little cobble

295
00:13:05,058 --> 00:13:07,730
together setup for a corporate in the

296
00:13:07,129 --> 00:13:11,058
mustard

297
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:12,649
so we flail mode it and then just

298
00:13:11,058 --> 00:13:15,259
seconds behind

299
00:13:12,649 --> 00:13:19,789
we disc arrow then coltie packed it

300
00:13:15,259 --> 00:13:23,928
seemed to work fairly well this is a 30

301
00:13:19,789 --> 00:13:25,698
foot lei Li tine weeder and we time with

302
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:28,458
a lot in our vegetable production we

303
00:13:25,698 --> 00:13:30,678
almost don't plant anything without a

304
00:13:28,458 --> 00:13:32,628
week and a half to two weeks of every

305
00:13:30,678 --> 00:13:35,328
three to four days tine weaning as a

306
00:13:32,629 --> 00:13:36,980
stale seed bed practice so I thought boy

307
00:13:35,328 --> 00:13:39,588
I'll do this on large scale for cover

308
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:41,600
crops and it'll work great and it didn't

309
00:13:39,589 --> 00:13:44,839
work that well and I can't I'm not

310
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:47,449
really quite sure why this spring are

311
00:13:44,839 --> 00:13:49,790
time we did a field for three weeks

312
00:13:47,448 --> 00:13:51,349
prior to seeding cover crops I think it

313
00:13:49,789 --> 00:13:53,629
was just too cold and wet nothing was

314
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:55,759
growing at all at that point because

315
00:13:53,629 --> 00:13:59,600
when I seen my cover crop I still had a

316
00:13:55,759 --> 00:14:02,509
whole lot of weeds come in so it's

317
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:03,920
probably just a timing thing but I'd

318
00:14:02,509 --> 00:14:06,829
almost rather just use a much higher

319
00:14:03,919 --> 00:14:08,928
rate with with some cheaper crops and

320
00:14:06,828 --> 00:14:10,338
and deal with it that way because you

321
00:14:08,928 --> 00:14:12,889
have to get out and about with this

322
00:14:10,339 --> 00:14:14,959
thing but I think it's a tool that has a

323
00:14:12,889 --> 00:14:16,548
lot of potential for cleaning up some

324
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:20,388
ground before seeding a cover crop to

325
00:14:16,548 --> 00:14:22,249
try to keep weeds from coming in but we

326
00:14:20,389 --> 00:14:26,839
haven't really found the sweet spot with

327
00:14:22,249 --> 00:14:28,459
it yet this is this no-till grain drill

328
00:14:26,839 --> 00:14:30,230
we has actually a minimal till this is

329
00:14:28,458 --> 00:14:32,599
the Caddy that went in front of a

330
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:36,769
regular grain drill and these Coulter's

331
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:38,269
made slices if anybody's interested I'm

332
00:14:36,769 --> 00:14:40,548
also learning how to do my own tiling

333
00:14:38,269 --> 00:14:44,149
that's a tile plot of the left hole

334
00:14:40,548 --> 00:14:46,009
another saga this is the grain drill

335
00:14:44,149 --> 00:14:49,428
that went behind that Coulter cart this

336
00:14:46,009 --> 00:14:52,539
was kind of a big cumbersome thing hard

337
00:14:49,428 --> 00:14:54,889
to turn around you know slow to pick up

338
00:14:52,539 --> 00:14:56,829
eat use quite a bit of horsepower to

339
00:14:54,889 --> 00:14:59,980
pull it

340
00:14:56,830 --> 00:15:06,520
besides it's not maybe the final

341
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:15,820
solution okay hopefully will blow up

342
00:15:06,519 --> 00:15:23,199
here at some point I'm stuck they won't

343
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:24,970
let me move about to restart yeah what I

344
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:26,350
found and I haven't done it enough to

345
00:15:24,970 --> 00:15:28,690
really be sure but it seems like those

346
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:30,220
large seated things if you let them go

347
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:33,580
to sea and let them sit on top of the

348
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:35,980
soil for the winter I have not had

349
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:38,860
problems when I incorporate them I

350
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:41,528
sometimes do but that's kind of cool to

351
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:43,240
learn that you can you know dump all

352
00:15:41,528 --> 00:15:46,240
this stuff on top of the soil and let

353
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:47,560
everything eat it all winter but I have

354
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:49,839
friends who had a lot of problems with

355
00:15:47,559 --> 00:15:54,129
buckwheat doing that so I don't know

356
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:56,140
that hasn't been an issue for us it's

357
00:15:54,129 --> 00:15:57,700
nice because I like to grow I like to

358
00:15:56,139 --> 00:15:59,049
have buckwheat as a component of some of

359
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:04,750
those mixes and of course it's going to

360
00:15:59,049 --> 00:16:06,759
seed so this is that Loompa Firth

361
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:09,578
rolling Harrow this is a really cool

362
00:16:06,759 --> 00:16:11,049
tool it's just these bat well we have

363
00:16:09,578 --> 00:16:14,469
these there's little scraper blade

364
00:16:11,049 --> 00:16:15,939
leveling blades or leveling Levellers

365
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:18,940
that's it in front of those baskets and

366
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:20,200
then little times they're off it right

367
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:23,649
now and then two sets the rolling

368
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:25,180
baskets this thinks 30 feet wide and so

369
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:27,370
we were worried about making really

370
00:16:25,179 --> 00:16:29,528
smooth hay fields for a while because we

371
00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:30,970
were that's sort of was our plan early

372
00:16:29,528 --> 00:16:33,250
on we're gonna be hanging and making all

373
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:35,440
this mulch and stuff and this is a

374
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:37,629
really important tool for making one

375
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:40,180
pass of this makes land you know fairly

376
00:16:37,629 --> 00:16:42,458
rough land pretty darn smooth it's also

377
00:16:40,179 --> 00:16:47,379
great if you're broadcasting cover crops

378
00:16:42,458 --> 00:16:48,869
to incorporate you can also stale seed

379
00:16:47,379 --> 00:16:52,179
bed with this it works really well

380
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:54,159
rather than the tine weeder every pass

381
00:16:52,179 --> 00:16:56,708
with it just makes things smoother and

382
00:16:54,159 --> 00:17:00,789
nicer and better this is 5000 bucks out

383
00:16:56,708 --> 00:17:02,139
of Quebec in good shape really awesome

384
00:17:00,789 --> 00:17:04,240
tool cover a lot of acres in a short

385
00:17:02,139 --> 00:17:06,730
amount of time this is another speed

386
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:09,490
distance is the Lumpkin Rubin this is

387
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:10,390
the one we got first we went away from

388
00:17:09,490 --> 00:17:11,920
it because the parts are

389
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:14,470
real expensive and you're gonna go

390
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:18,720
through disks and bearings and it just

391
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:18,720
seemed kind of crazy how much they cost

392
00:17:18,869 --> 00:17:23,019
I've got a power here a couple years ago

393
00:17:21,338 --> 00:17:24,429
it

394
00:17:23,019 --> 00:17:26,709
we actually have broken a lot of sod

395
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:33,009
with this - in places that are too steep

396
00:17:26,709 --> 00:17:35,320
to plow doesn't do great in rocks really

397
00:17:33,009 --> 00:17:37,920
great for finished touch over vegetable

398
00:17:35,319 --> 00:17:41,289
crops just another piece of the

399
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:44,769
component in France they seed a lot of

400
00:17:41,289 --> 00:17:47,440
green behind power arrows seems to be

401
00:17:44,769 --> 00:17:49,809
the standard practice over there there's

402
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:54,279
a there's a you know grain drill mounted

403
00:17:49,809 --> 00:17:56,470
behind the power Harrow really easy just

404
00:17:54,279 --> 00:17:58,089
two pins on a roller so you can go

405
00:17:56,470 --> 00:18:00,339
really fast and really shallow

406
00:17:58,089 --> 00:18:02,709
you can go eight miles an hour and just

407
00:18:00,339 --> 00:18:04,689
be skimming along or you can really

408
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:08,829
really good it's a very versatile tool

409
00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:10,690
it's just it's much it's better tool if

410
00:18:08,829 --> 00:18:11,859
you don't have a lot of rocks so we tend

411
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:15,340
to use it in certain fields

412
00:18:11,859 --> 00:18:19,479
not another ones speaking of rocks Rock

413
00:18:15,339 --> 00:18:21,129
rake we got we've took on 70 acres a

414
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:23,860
couple Springs ago that was a corn

415
00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:26,350
ground I mean I think it has a rock

416
00:18:23,859 --> 00:18:28,779
resource there the the number of cobbles

417
00:18:26,349 --> 00:18:31,990
like this is just infinite and we were

418
00:18:28,779 --> 00:18:35,049
able to seed really nice alfalfa grass

419
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:36,460
down by making one pass with this thing

420
00:18:35,049 --> 00:18:40,180
and then we had another machine to pick

421
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:43,259
up the rocks and this also leaves a

422
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:48,940
perfectly smooth finish for for seeding

423
00:18:43,259 --> 00:18:50,859
versatile tool these ill the round bale

424
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:52,029
mulching because I kind of think of

425
00:18:50,859 --> 00:18:53,740
mulching it's kind of an extension of

426
00:18:52,029 --> 00:18:55,359
cover crop but you think about no-till I

427
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:57,420
think about all the different things you

428
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:59,439
can do mulching is sort of like moving

429
00:18:57,420 --> 00:19:02,920
moving cover crop from one place to

430
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:06,100
another this is a real simple old-time

431
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:07,660
Bale chopper it's more of a flail the

432
00:19:06,099 --> 00:19:10,019
flails just kind of beat around this it

433
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:12,190
doesn't actually cut the grass at all

434
00:19:10,019 --> 00:19:15,339
but it throws it out it's really good

435
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:16,900
for garlic and strawberries things were

436
00:19:15,339 --> 00:19:20,289
you're just kind of doing bulk mulching

437
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:21,269
it's really fast simple tool not a lot

438
00:19:20,289 --> 00:19:23,710
to go wrong

439
00:19:21,269 --> 00:19:27,660
this is the best one we found for

440
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:30,400
actually cutting quite short this is a

441
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:31,750
has it two different chopping systems in

442
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:34,180
there takes a lot of horsepower it's

443
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:36,670
pretty slow it's maybe a bail every five

444
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:37,900
minutes four to five minutes you don't

445
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:39,130
wanna have any rocks or going like that

446
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:43,720
and your bail it's got to be nice and

447
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:45,940
clean different purpose this is what we

448
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:49,299
were trying to use to blow onto the

449
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:51,850
vegetable crops and it actually works

450
00:19:49,299 --> 00:19:54,759
well this does chop it fine enough that

451
00:19:51,849 --> 00:19:57,879
it works pretty well it's just a pretty

452
00:19:54,759 --> 00:19:59,259
slow step and I'm not sure if we're

453
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:10,220
going to be incorporating it into a lot

454
00:19:59,259 --> 00:20:11,990
of our acreage or not thanks

455
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:14,210
this is I'm just learned about these

456
00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:17,599
this is an air seeding cart and idea is

457
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:20,690
to pull this I have a 20 foot wide one

458
00:20:17,599 --> 00:20:23,719
of those fireman's coming and idea being

459
00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:25,940
we could pull this behind that and be

460
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:27,798
seating into the far mint with it it's

461
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:29,750
kind of a big cumbersome thing but I

462
00:20:27,798 --> 00:20:32,329
could go out with 4 tons of seed and

463
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:34,548
something like this and you know not

464
00:20:32,329 --> 00:20:36,408
have to come back and refill this would

465
00:20:34,548 --> 00:20:40,490
be like for a bulk like 300 pounds an

466
00:20:36,409 --> 00:20:43,429
acre oats stuff like that so if anybody

467
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:46,370
has any experience with with this or an

468
00:20:43,429 --> 00:20:49,879
air seater like this I found this this

469
00:20:46,369 --> 00:20:51,819
is in England but it's a big you know

470
00:20:49,878 --> 00:20:54,199
big tank where the seed goes and then

471
00:20:51,819 --> 00:20:55,939
those are just shanks where the seed

472
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:58,220
comes out they're five inches apart so

473
00:20:55,940 --> 00:21:01,190
it's really close spacing that's a 24

474
00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:03,169
foot wide machine but I got to get away

475
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:05,690
from the 12-foot wide grain drill which

476
00:21:03,169 --> 00:21:08,960
is taking too long for the land we're

477
00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:12,019
covering and this just survived today

478
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:17,389
this is this is what we're gonna pull

479
00:21:12,019 --> 00:21:18,319
the 20 foot new speed disc with because

480
00:21:17,388 --> 00:21:20,349
I want to spend more time with my

481
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:22,638
daughter unless time on the tractor and

482
00:21:20,349 --> 00:21:26,558
these things are cheap I mean the

483
00:21:22,638 --> 00:21:26,558
horsepower like this is super cheap and

484
00:21:28,058 --> 00:21:33,908
we're moving towards speed you know

485
00:21:30,829 --> 00:21:36,470
quick passes shallow passes fast passes

486
00:21:33,909 --> 00:21:41,149
you know incorporated it get something

487
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:46,329
else on so sort of like our version of

488
00:21:41,148 --> 00:21:48,829
no-till is lots of quick shallow passes

489
00:21:46,329 --> 00:21:51,888
not bringing up lots of weed seeds from

490
00:21:48,829 --> 00:21:55,308
below lots of different cover crops and

491
00:21:51,888 --> 00:21:59,449
different sequences and as you can tell

492
00:21:55,308 --> 00:22:04,058
very much a learning process that's it

493
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:04,058
for slides questions comments

494
00:22:05,329 --> 00:22:12,098
[Applause]

495
00:22:14,069 --> 00:22:27,879
top secret yeah

496
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:30,009
12 grand 360 it's crazy

497
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:32,528
biggest tractor I have is 140 horsepower

498
00:22:30,009 --> 00:22:36,099
it's also 13 feet why just gonna be

499
00:22:32,528 --> 00:22:37,869
interesting on the roads but but we pull

500
00:22:36,099 --> 00:22:39,250
implements down the road that are 15

501
00:22:37,869 --> 00:22:43,209
feet wide but there's something about

502
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:47,888
the height that scares people right out

503
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:49,179
front my neighbor is restoring a Porsche

504
00:22:47,888 --> 00:22:50,709
and I told him this is going to come

505
00:22:49,179 --> 00:22:55,120
into a shop we're gonna paint this first

506
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:57,190
to like say it but this I get this sort

507
00:22:55,119 --> 00:23:00,069
of thumbs up like how we do things we

508
00:22:57,190 --> 00:23:01,870
kind of go online learn about it figure

509
00:23:00,069 --> 00:23:03,730
out how to buy a version of it that we

510
00:23:01,869 --> 00:23:05,558
can afford bring it home try it

511
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:06,788
sometimes they work out sometimes they

512
00:23:05,558 --> 00:23:08,980
don't but you don't know until you get

513
00:23:06,788 --> 00:23:12,879
it home and you always learn something

514
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:16,589
interesting and it just informs the next

515
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:16,590
step of the process yeah

516
00:23:20,119 --> 00:23:24,859
oh of course that varies a lot from you

517
00:23:23,119 --> 00:23:29,209
know if you're sitting down I saw alpha

518
00:23:24,859 --> 00:23:31,879
grass mix it's gonna be 45 50 to 70

519
00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:33,710
bucks for the seed sometimes I'm going

520
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:39,730
organic here sometimes I'm not depending

521
00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:42,380
on whether I can get it you know it's

522
00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:46,370
the 300 pounds of oats I can get done

523
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:50,600
organically for 55 to 60 something like

524
00:23:46,369 --> 00:23:54,919
that the Sun hemp was an expensive

525
00:23:50,599 --> 00:23:57,469
failure you know and that's the question

526
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:59,720
I often ask myself you know is is three

527
00:23:57,470 --> 00:24:01,009
crops in a season you know if I have a

528
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:02,870
piece of ground I'm really trying to

529
00:24:01,009 --> 00:24:04,339
break up a weed seed cycle and I might

530
00:24:02,869 --> 00:24:05,479
want to actually have three cover crops

531
00:24:04,339 --> 00:24:07,939
in the course of a season to have a

532
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:10,789
little tillage in between am I gonna

533
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:12,320
spend a hundred bucks per seeding there

534
00:24:10,789 --> 00:24:13,579
it's probably totally worth it but I

535
00:24:12,319 --> 00:24:14,750
don't really know that math I don't

536
00:24:13,579 --> 00:24:16,399
really know what makes sense

537
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:17,930
I have vegetable crops that gross

538
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:20,420
forty-five thousand dollars an acre so

539
00:24:17,930 --> 00:24:23,180
sure why not but it adds up you know it

540
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:25,430
starts to seem like a lot of money my

541
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:25,940
sense is the more you spend it's totally

542
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:28,400
worth it

543
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:30,850
you just sized for us it's a new part of

544
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:35,420
our budget we're kind of getting used to

545
00:24:30,849 --> 00:24:36,889
so it seems like our seed costs just

546
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:39,880
keep going up and up but I think the

547
00:24:36,890 --> 00:24:39,880
benefits are really there

548
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:45,710
so what's your like typical rotation

549
00:24:43,730 --> 00:24:48,480
you're in vegetable in the field but Cup

550
00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:50,700
well what the the grand plan was 2 years

551
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:52,920
veggies in two years in a sod crop but

552
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:53,850
I'm finding that in my second year in

553
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:57,000
veggies I'm not getting the performance

554
00:24:53,849 --> 00:24:58,919
I want so I'm looking now mostly at

555
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,359
one-year veggies and land that's in

556
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:03,690
really good shape probably one year's

557
00:25:00,359 --> 00:25:04,919
veggies one year cover crop sometimes

558
00:25:03,690 --> 00:25:06,480
the one year in cover crop is more like

559
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:08,779
a year and a half you know how all this

560
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:10,860
stuff kind of goes around the circles

561
00:25:08,779 --> 00:25:12,240
but I actually have enough land here I

562
00:25:10,859 --> 00:25:14,549
could basically be one year in veggies

563
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:17,130
two years off three years off in some

564
00:25:14,549 --> 00:25:19,440
cases and I have some I have some land

565
00:25:17,130 --> 00:25:21,630
that still is recovering from being over

566
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:23,220
crop for a while so it'll be off for

567
00:25:21,630 --> 00:25:26,160
three years

568
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:28,170
but I'm finding that in that second year

569
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:29,880
no matter how good a job we did the

570
00:25:28,170 --> 00:25:31,019
first year in weed control I start

571
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:33,330
having some weeds going to seed in the

572
00:25:31,019 --> 00:25:35,700
second year and we don't we don't spend

573
00:25:33,329 --> 00:25:38,369
hardly any time hand weeding on in my

574
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:40,289
farm very very very small part of our

575
00:25:38,369 --> 00:25:44,250
budget so it's either controlled with

576
00:25:40,289 --> 00:25:45,809
tractor cultivation and pre pre

577
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:50,069
treatment or it's not really controlled

578
00:25:45,809 --> 00:25:51,779
so I like I like land that's just

579
00:25:50,069 --> 00:25:53,669
first-year and veggies after not being

580
00:25:51,779 --> 00:25:56,220
in it for a couple of years it really it

581
00:25:53,670 --> 00:26:00,320
solves a ton of problems and it makes

582
00:25:56,220 --> 00:26:00,319
all this stuff seem cheap in comparison

583
00:26:02,179 --> 00:26:09,059
yeah but that was but but that was

584
00:26:06,390 --> 00:26:10,920
created though by deciding to make that

585
00:26:09,058 --> 00:26:14,720
happen and I know it can't happen

586
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:14,720
everywhere maybe but I think

587
00:26:17,369 --> 00:26:22,719
well you know sneak them in wherever you

588
00:26:19,569 --> 00:26:24,700
can but I would advise trying to I see

589
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:27,490
great benefits to from a rotation that

590
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:29,890
goes a mile or two or three miles away

591
00:26:27,490 --> 00:26:32,170
you know potato peels for us are a real

592
00:26:29,890 --> 00:26:35,009
problem and if we can move our 10 acres

593
00:26:32,170 --> 00:26:38,259
of potatoes a couple three miles away

594
00:26:35,009 --> 00:26:40,509
it's really a lot better so we've gotten

595
00:26:38,259 --> 00:26:43,750
really comfortable we travel 20 acres or

596
00:26:40,509 --> 00:26:45,279
20 miles right now to one farm we've

597
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:47,349
gotten comfortable with the travel and

598
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:53,889
the trade off of that prepared to have

599
00:26:47,349 --> 00:26:54,789
it everything closed we wait well we

600
00:26:53,890 --> 00:26:56,440
won't be cropping down there for a

601
00:26:54,789 --> 00:27:05,139
couple of years but yeah I mean it goes

602
00:26:56,440 --> 00:27:07,210
23 miles an hour why not right yeah I

603
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:09,070
don't know we we don't irrigate there's

604
00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:10,990
another thing so for us to move around

605
00:27:09,069 --> 00:27:12,789
we haven't irrigated outdoors in 7 years

606
00:27:10,990 --> 00:27:14,500
partly that's our climate partly it's a

607
00:27:12,789 --> 00:27:17,109
lot organic matter residue in the soil

608
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:20,079
so we're not so tied into an

609
00:27:17,109 --> 00:27:24,189
infrastructure we can go and get a new

610
00:27:20,079 --> 00:27:26,379
field and farm over here so it's sort of

611
00:27:24,190 --> 00:27:28,420
like we're sort of like creating these

612
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:29,980
landscapes around that are in prime

613
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:31,720
condition for vegetables and we sort of

614
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:33,430
- it and grow a crop and get out of

615
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:38,079
there again that's how I think about it

616
00:27:33,430 --> 00:27:41,650
and that is leading to a fairly low

617
00:27:38,079 --> 00:27:44,500
input fairly low cost production system

618
00:27:41,650 --> 00:27:46,180
that seems to be working for us but it

619
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:48,549
still no three years before everything

620
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:53,740
kind of is fully online and make it all

621
00:27:48,549 --> 00:27:55,869
work the right way I thought I was gonna

622
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:59,519
first but then the the turns out the

623
00:27:55,869 --> 00:28:02,529
fertility suck up of hay is enormous so

624
00:27:59,519 --> 00:28:05,410
even even just to replace the nutrients

625
00:28:02,529 --> 00:28:07,269
that's taking is about two-thirds of the

626
00:28:05,410 --> 00:28:09,790
value of the hay and then there's

627
00:28:07,269 --> 00:28:11,769
nothing to screw up trying to grow

628
00:28:09,789 --> 00:28:14,079
vegetables than having a major hang week

629
00:28:11,769 --> 00:28:15,759
going on because it's the same guys the

630
00:28:14,079 --> 00:28:16,869
same equipment when you're hanging

631
00:28:15,759 --> 00:28:18,460
you're hanging I mean you're not do

632
00:28:16,869 --> 00:28:20,649
anything else and we actually love

633
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:25,000
hanging it's super fun we get all

634
00:28:20,650 --> 00:28:27,040
excited about it but so now we're mostly

635
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:29,230
flail mowing stuff back down we make we

636
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:29,579
have a pig farm as well so we make a

637
00:28:29,230 --> 00:28:31,170
whole

638
00:28:29,579 --> 00:28:33,869
around bales for it but they come back

639
00:28:31,170 --> 00:28:36,539
onto the land and I think if you were

640
00:28:33,869 --> 00:28:39,329
doing like a small round or small square

641
00:28:36,539 --> 00:28:41,609
bale premium organic hay thing you can

642
00:28:39,329 --> 00:28:43,859
make money doing it but you'd have to be

643
00:28:41,609 --> 00:28:45,839
set up for it and it's just not it's too

644
00:28:43,859 --> 00:28:51,299
too wet where we are to that it's hard

645
00:28:45,839 --> 00:28:55,289
to try it so we actually had to buy we

646
00:28:51,299 --> 00:28:57,569
have a mower with metal on metal rollers

647
00:28:55,289 --> 00:29:02,220
in order to crimp the legumes well

648
00:28:57,569 --> 00:29:04,139
enough to get legumes dry at all for our

649
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:05,750
mulching hand for our pig Hey

650
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:07,560
because we're trying not to wrap bales
