1
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:06,359
This is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:03,359 --> 00:00:06,359
University.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,599
Yeah, I'm basically going to talk about

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:15,919
uh what I've done so far and how I see

5
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:18,800
myself develop as a soil scientist

6
00:00:15,919 --> 00:00:21,839
moving forward. So, uh I'm excited for

7
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:24,080
the talk. Uh so yeah I'm going to be

8
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:26,320
jumping around different research

9
00:00:24,079 --> 00:00:28,959
projects that I've done in the past

10
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:31,439
starting from my undergrad

11
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:34,640
uh through my masters and then my PhD

12
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:37,359
work uh some postto work that I did uh

13
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:40,159
with Ryan lab and also I will give a

14
00:00:37,359 --> 00:00:43,960
brief uh glimpse of what I'll be doing

15
00:00:40,159 --> 00:00:45,558
uh in the coming year at Penn State.

16
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:50,160
So

17
00:00:45,558 --> 00:00:53,920
uh I'm from Nepal. So uh it's a small

18
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:56,799
country. Uh I'm from a valley

19
00:00:53,920 --> 00:01:01,198
uh which one of the biggest valley in

20
00:00:56,799 --> 00:01:04,640
Asia. So and rice is our staple crop. Uh

21
00:01:01,198 --> 00:01:08,719
I'm from somewhere here and this is me

22
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:11,118
and my brother while growing up. So

23
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:13,519
uh again uh lots of influence of

24
00:01:11,118 --> 00:01:15,359
agriculture while growing up and because

25
00:01:13,519 --> 00:01:18,599
it's a big agricultural country it's

26
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:23,719
hard to not uh think about

27
00:01:18,599 --> 00:01:26,879
agriculture uh there. So again bit of uh

28
00:01:23,719 --> 00:01:29,039
background I worked with bioar as Matt

29
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:31,519
mentioned during my undergrad I'll talk

30
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:34,560
a little bit more about that and during

31
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:37,840
my masters at the University of Tokyo I

32
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:40,000
worked with uh calsign phosphate rock so

33
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:42,640
this was a local phosphate rock

34
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,040
fertilizer that we are developing in uh

35
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:48,319
in coordination with a university of

36
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:52,079
Tokyo Jurkas and also people uh in West

37
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:54,158
Africa. So that was my main master's

38
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:58,559
project and we did some crop modeling

39
00:01:54,159 --> 00:02:01,520
with ABSIM uh to simulate those data. Uh

40
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:04,399
my PhD project was mainly looking at

41
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:07,840
biochar and carbon nanoparticles as soil

42
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:10,878
amendments for coarse textured sandy uh

43
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:12,878
acidic soils in Florida. And we also

44
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:15,679
looked at different nanoparticles. It

45
00:02:12,878 --> 00:02:17,759
was a more of a side project. Uh during

46
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:20,959
my PhD

47
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:24,399
uh one year around one year uh at Ryan

48
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:26,719
Lab, I got to work with uh some of the

49
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,599
uh soil health stuff uh soil health data

50
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:31,359
from the long-term experiment that we're

51
00:02:28,598 --> 00:02:34,238
having and a bunch of different cover

52
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:38,239
crop uh systems that uh the cool work

53
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:40,640
that is happening uh with Ryan Lab. And

54
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:44,719
in my uh current project, I'll be

55
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:46,878
working mainly on uh using uh anorobic

56
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:50,878
soil disinfestation. So this is a kind

57
00:02:46,878 --> 00:02:54,239
of like a a technique in organic systems

58
00:02:50,878 --> 00:02:56,639
an alternative to chemical fumigant to

59
00:02:54,239 --> 00:03:01,519
sort of restore or improve the soil

60
00:02:56,639 --> 00:03:05,359
health of uh of organic soils. So I'll

61
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:07,920
be introducing that a little bit. So uh

62
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:11,360
back going back to Nepal where I'm from

63
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:12,919
we we have a big problem. Uh again we

64
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:16,319
call it the burning

65
00:03:12,919 --> 00:03:19,280
problem. Uh so farmers especially at the

66
00:03:16,318 --> 00:03:22,878
end of the season uh they burn a lot of

67
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:25,439
the crop residues because as as a way to

68
00:03:22,878 --> 00:03:28,479
prepare their field for the next crop.

69
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:31,439
uh but this creates a massive issue

70
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:33,919
environmentally and if you look at uh

71
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:36,318
look at the NASA firms map during that

72
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:39,199
time of the season you can see a bunch

73
00:03:36,318 --> 00:03:42,639
of fire kind of small fires and these

74
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:45,280
are not real fires but these are farmers

75
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:47,919
burning the residue uh especially the

76
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,919
the southern part of Nepal where a lot

77
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:53,439
of agriculture rice wheat based

78
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:56,079
agriculture is so and this affects uh

79
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:57,919
the environment and you can see the haze

80
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:01,040
uh pretty much and the beautiful

81
00:03:57,919 --> 00:04:03,598
mountains that people go uh to see are

82
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:07,000
not really visible during that time. So

83
00:04:03,598 --> 00:04:09,518
it's a big issue uh managing crop

84
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,840
residues. So yeah I think when we are

85
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:14,400
doing undergrad we are about five or six

86
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:17,840
people who are thinking about an project

87
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:20,639
how to address this issue and again

88
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:22,239
there's a saying in in our country that

89
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:24,160
sometime you need to have a solution

90
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:28,720
like the problem. So we we came up with

91
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:32,560
the burning uh burning solution idea. It

92
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:34,400
was so we we decided to uh get some of

93
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:38,000
the crop residues and prepare different

94
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:40,000
kinds of biochar from uh these residues.

95
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,040
It was yeah it was a locally kind of

96
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:46,160
like developed furnace that we used to

97
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:49,360
prepare these biochar and we did a field

98
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:52,240
study with garden pee and we found that

99
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:54,000
again different uh different feed stock

100
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:57,918
of biochar that we use have different

101
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:00,399
kind of effect on on the yield but also

102
00:04:57,918 --> 00:05:04,478
uh on how the soil nutrient availability

103
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:07,079
and cycling uh happens. But overall I

104
00:05:04,478 --> 00:05:10,159
think we could say that uh using

105
00:05:07,079 --> 00:05:13,879
bioar uh was a good alternative

106
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:17,680
especially compared to burning those

107
00:05:13,879 --> 00:05:19,519
residues. So moving on again I told you

108
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:22,400
I'll be jumping from one to another. You

109
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:25,198
can ask questions later if you have some

110
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:26,879
uh I worked in West Africa during my

111
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:29,120
master's program. So here like I

112
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:30,879
mentioned we are working with a local

113
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:33,600
phosphate rock fertilizer as an

114
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:35,519
alternative to the chemical triple super

115
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,919
phosphate or single super phosphate

116
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:40,560
fertilizer and we are doing uh field

117
00:05:37,918 --> 00:05:43,918
studies with sorghum in four different

118
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:45,319
regions of of Burkinaaso a country in

119
00:05:43,918 --> 00:05:49,038
west

120
00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:54,079
Africa and what we found essentially was

121
00:05:49,038 --> 00:05:56,560
uh oops uh was that uh it was again on

122
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:58,879
average about 30 to 50% and effective

123
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:01,600
compared to the chemical fertilizer but

124
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:04,560
that really depended a lot on the region

125
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:06,639
and the factor that was driving uh

126
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:09,759
driving that difference across the

127
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:13,120
region was uh was the environment. So uh

128
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:15,680
soil moisture and also the soil type has

129
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:18,399
had a major impact on how effective

130
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:21,519
these new uh phosphate rock fertilizers

131
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:24,560
were. So uh we did a bit of a crop

132
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:27,038
modeling with Absim. It was uh we were

133
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:30,000
able to predict or simulate the biomass

134
00:06:27,038 --> 00:06:33,759
quite well but we were uh we're still

135
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:36,879
working on uh how to work or how to

136
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:38,639
accurately predict yield uh with appsim

137
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:41,360
because it was not really sensitive to

138
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:43,360
drought and uh that is something that

139
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:47,199
has been added I think since in appsim

140
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:52,080
so it's a lot more robust in terms of uh

141
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:56,080
simulating these systems uh apps as uh

142
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:58,240
compared to this was 2019. So

143
00:06:56,079 --> 00:06:59,680
uh and then uh my PhD was at the

144
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:02,240
University of Florida where I worked

145
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:05,840
with uh carbon nanop particles and

146
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:08,240
biochar at soil amendments uh for uh for

147
00:07:05,839 --> 00:07:11,038
the acidic sandy soils that that are in

148
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:13,598
Florida. So again the big question I

149
00:07:11,038 --> 00:07:16,879
guess that most of us in this room are

150
00:07:13,598 --> 00:07:21,120
working towards I believe uh is how can

151
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:23,519
we grow more food and again the how to

152
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:25,840
grow it economically and also

153
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:28,719
sustainably. So uh that was the idea

154
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:30,879
behind this project and again there are

155
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,880
different ways different management

156
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:36,399
practices different things that we are

157
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:38,478
all working on but uh one of the ways uh

158
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:41,758
that we can increase our overall food

159
00:07:38,478 --> 00:07:44,240
production could be uh if we know how to

160
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:46,560
utilize our sandy soils. Uh currently

161
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:48,720
there is only about four to 5% of sandy

162
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:51,519
soils in the world uh that are

163
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:54,160
cultivated. So uh again if we can figure

164
00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:56,240
out how to cultivate them uh there's

165
00:07:54,160 --> 00:08:00,879
there's a room for expansion and there

166
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:03,598
are opportunities there but as you can

167
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:05,680
imagine there's a reason why these soils

168
00:08:03,598 --> 00:08:07,918
are not cultivated as much because it's

169
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:10,720
not really easy to manage especially the

170
00:08:07,918 --> 00:08:15,318
soils that are really sandy uh like like

171
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:19,039
those in Florida uh more than 90% sands

172
00:08:15,319 --> 00:08:22,879
and and those that are acidic pH in in

173
00:08:19,038 --> 00:08:25,038
the range of 4.5 to 5 5.5 and it's

174
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:26,400
really difficult to build organic matter

175
00:08:25,038 --> 00:08:29,199
in these conditions because of the

176
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:31,679
humidity, temperature and everything. So

177
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:34,800
not not easy to retain organic matter

178
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:37,839
and nutrients in the soil. Uh it doesn't

179
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:40,958
help that these regions uh that have a

180
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:43,080
lot of sandy soils often also are in the

181
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:46,599
area that are quite vulnerable to

182
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:49,440
climate if we can still say climate uh

183
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:50,959
environment uh and all these kind of

184
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,120
pollution

185
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:55,039
uh that makes it really difficult to

186
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,879
manage.

187
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:58,799
Uh historically though I think these

188
00:08:56,879 --> 00:09:01,000
soils have been managed quite

189
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:03,439
successfully uh thanks to the citrus

190
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:08,000
industry. Uh that was quite successful

191
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:09,680
in Florida. Uh but uh since 2010 uh more

192
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,480
than a decade now there's been a steady

193
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:14,639
decline and the industry is really

194
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:17,200
suffering from the citrus greening

195
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:19,759
disease. So there's a lot of interest

196
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:21,360
there's a lot of need uh among farmers

197
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:25,000
among different stakeholders to find

198
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:28,560
alternative crops to straightress uh and

199
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:30,639
because of that we are trying to see uh

200
00:09:28,559 --> 00:09:33,039
if we can amend these soils to come up

201
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:34,958
with ways we can grow field crops in

202
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:36,759
that region.

203
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:38,919
Uh we looked at different soil

204
00:09:36,759 --> 00:09:40,600
amendments, compost,

205
00:09:38,919 --> 00:09:43,360
manure,

206
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:45,839
biochar, again different uh different

207
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:48,320
properties, compost and manure, more

208
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:51,440
readily available nutrients versus more

209
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:53,839
recalent carbon. So uh different

210
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:56,800
challenges associ associated with uh

211
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:59,440
each of these. And while we were

212
00:09:56,799 --> 00:10:04,159
thinking about an idea, we also learned

213
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:07,040
about this new uh technology, new uh

214
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:09,799
term I guess uh called nanotechnology.

215
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:11,958
So this was driven by the United States

216
00:10:09,799 --> 00:10:14,719
nanotechnology initiative that was

217
00:10:11,958 --> 00:10:16,479
released in 2000 and there was a bunch

218
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:19,839
of different nanoparticles that were

219
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:21,519
being researched uh since. So again we

220
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:25,440
found that carbon nanop particle could

221
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:27,519
be one way uh of supplementing these

222
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:30,560
soils and amending to provide more

223
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:33,200
carbon so the nutrient can be retained

224
00:10:30,559 --> 00:10:35,518
much more. And so we we started to

225
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:38,160
investigate on these product and we we

226
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:40,720
did some preliminary studies and uh

227
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:42,639
basically my PhD work focused on

228
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:47,200
comparing biochar and carbon nanop

229
00:10:42,639 --> 00:10:49,439
particles uh for how they work how they

230
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:51,759
affect nutrient retention how they

231
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:54,720
affect crops crop growth and performance

232
00:10:51,759 --> 00:10:58,319
and also if if and how we can optimize

233
00:10:54,720 --> 00:11:00,360
these systems uh in the region. An

234
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:03,760
obvious question. What are nanop

235
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:06,079
particles? Uh basically any particle

236
00:11:03,759 --> 00:11:09,360
that are in the range of a billionth of

237
00:11:06,078 --> 00:11:12,239
a meter is known as nanoparticles for

238
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:15,159
people working in the soil. Uh the the

239
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:17,120
fine clay particles are also natural

240
00:11:15,159 --> 00:11:19,600
nanoparticles. We're of course talking

241
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:21,720
about the engineered nanoparticles here

242
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:24,320
but just to give a

243
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:27,040
reference. So yeah basically something

244
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:30,200
that is available in nature but also can

245
00:11:27,039 --> 00:11:32,559
be uh generated in uh through

246
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:34,320
industry. Carbon is a big component of

247
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:37,518
soil. We all know a lot of different

248
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:40,720
soil functioning especially nutrient uh

249
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:43,200
depends on carbon. Uh one way of kind of

250
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:46,480
like understanding these carbon nanop

251
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:49,519
particles could be to think it as

252
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:51,278
ultra fine biochar cannot uh not that

253
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:52,720
straightforward but just for visualizing

254
00:11:51,278 --> 00:11:54,480
that and there are different kinds of

255
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:56,720
nanoparticles

256
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:58,879
uh mainly based on sape and solubility

257
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:01,040
and all these kind of things. Uh you

258
00:11:58,879 --> 00:12:03,838
might have heard about uh single wall

259
00:12:01,039 --> 00:12:05,599
multi-wall nano tubes bucky balls and

260
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:08,240
all different kinds of nanoparticle that

261
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:10,320
are used in different industry.

262
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:12,639
uh we're using the carbon black nanop

263
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:17,160
particles. So this was uh basically

264
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:20,240
utilizing the byproduct of uh the

265
00:12:17,159 --> 00:12:22,000
industry and we wanted to make it water

266
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:24,320
dispersible so it can be applied through

267
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,919
the existing uh irrigation and

268
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:30,079
fertigation systems by the

269
00:12:26,919 --> 00:12:32,319
farmers. And the idea behind using these

270
00:12:30,078 --> 00:12:34,078
nanoparticle is because when you when

271
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:37,839
you convert these particle into such a

272
00:12:34,078 --> 00:12:40,559
small size uh they they gain high jeta

273
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:42,160
potential a negative charge potential a

274
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:44,638
high surface area of course with the

275
00:12:42,159 --> 00:12:47,278
size and uh they have been shown to have

276
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:51,120
some kind of uh bio bio- stimulating

277
00:12:47,278 --> 00:12:53,039
effect to crops but it was still new and

278
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,959
not a lot of studies has have been done

279
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:58,000
in across different crops. So we wanted

280
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:59,399
to see how it behaves uh in the soils we

281
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,879
have down in

282
00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:06,078
Florida. To give you a perspective uh

283
00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:09,278
that it's not only about the size uh

284
00:13:06,078 --> 00:13:11,439
when you uh reduce the particle size to

285
00:13:09,278 --> 00:13:14,078
such small

286
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:17,279
uh dimension the property of the

287
00:13:14,078 --> 00:13:19,599
particle also changes uh significantly.

288
00:13:17,278 --> 00:13:22,000
So it's not only the size or the surface

289
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:24,720
area effect but the properties also

290
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,639
change and that could impart different

291
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:29,839
uh properties to plants and also in the

292
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:33,039
soil. So that's why we wanted to study.

293
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:35,519
Oh that didn't come out as I wanted but

294
00:13:33,039 --> 00:13:37,919
uh so my project had three components

295
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:40,560
plant soil and environment. So we're

296
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:43,039
looking at how it uh how plants uptake

297
00:13:40,559 --> 00:13:45,679
and respond to these particles how does

298
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:48,399
soil respond how does nutrient cycling

299
00:13:45,679 --> 00:13:51,519
is affected and how does it affect

300
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:53,440
environment. So we did a bunch of

301
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:55,679
uh incubation and greenhouse studies in

302
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:57,519
the beginning uh some column leeching

303
00:13:55,679 --> 00:14:00,319
studies to see how it's less in the

304
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:02,320
environment and how uh how long it can

305
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:05,440
stay in the environment. That was our

306
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:08,000
initial idea even though we could not do

307
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:10,760
uh during my time but uh the people at

308
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:13,198
UCF are now doing that uh life cycle

309
00:14:10,759 --> 00:14:15,120
assessment. Uh we also looked at some

310
00:14:13,198 --> 00:14:17,039
soil ecology especially how it affects

311
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:20,320
soil microbiome

312
00:14:17,039 --> 00:14:22,719
uh bacteria uh and then we took uh took

313
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:24,519
these particles into field uh for some

314
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:26,959
field

315
00:14:24,519 --> 00:14:29,120
trials. So a couple of greenhouse

316
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:31,679
studies basically we found that the

317
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:35,039
effect of these particles was dependent

318
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:38,159
on the application rate as uh as we

319
00:14:35,039 --> 00:14:41,039
could imagine. We found that around 200

320
00:14:38,159 --> 00:14:43,519
to 400 ppm or milligram per kg

321
00:14:41,039 --> 00:14:48,958
application uh there was a spike in

322
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:50,560
terms of uh both uh plants on how how

323
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:54,078
well they were growing but also in the

324
00:14:50,559 --> 00:14:56,239
soil uh in terms of uh how much

325
00:14:54,078 --> 00:14:58,719
nutrients was being retained. But we

326
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:00,959
also noticed that as we increase these

327
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:03,199
uh application rates to higher rates uh

328
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:05,759
the the effects seized quite

329
00:15:03,198 --> 00:15:08,559
dramatically at sometimes and even in

330
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:10,480
soil especially the soil microbiome and

331
00:15:08,559 --> 00:15:13,599
uh biological indicators started to

332
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:16,278
drop. So we we kind of saw uh that kind

333
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:19,600
of response through our greenhouse

334
00:15:16,278 --> 00:15:22,799
studies. Uh and then we did some column

335
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:25,920
leeching studies uh uh in two different

336
00:15:22,799 --> 00:15:28,719
soils uh alysol and sportool. basically

337
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:31,439
differing in pads. I would say uh

338
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:33,519
sportool much more acidic around pH5

339
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:35,839
versus alphasol

340
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:39,000
uh p7. So we also wanted to kind of see

341
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:42,560
across both pads because uh these

342
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:44,720
particles have a low pads. So yeah, we

343
00:15:42,559 --> 00:15:48,000
looked at uh different nutrients and how

344
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:50,440
they were being leased. Uh the bars that

345
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:54,159
are kind of red, yellow

346
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:57,440
and orange I guess are kind of like a

347
00:15:54,159 --> 00:15:59,838
high input systems. So the they were

348
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:02,480
highly fertilized versus these uh they

349
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:04,639
were low input systems. So uh we found

350
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:07,199
that in general

351
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:10,879
uh carbon nanoparticles we used two

352
00:16:07,198 --> 00:16:14,319
different uh treatments. So uh again we

353
00:16:10,879 --> 00:16:16,559
we ran about 13 leeching events uh

354
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:19,839
accumulating about 2 years of rainfall

355
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:23,679
in the region and we found that uh 200

356
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:27,199
to 400 mgram per kg of these carbon

357
00:16:23,679 --> 00:16:29,278
nanomart particles were were retaining a

358
00:16:27,198 --> 00:16:31,758
lot more nutrients in the soil. So the

359
00:16:29,278 --> 00:16:33,519
the cumulative leeching of of nitrate

360
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:36,199
from the soil especially in those

361
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:39,000
intensive systems were reduced

362
00:16:36,198 --> 00:16:42,719
significantly throughout our uh leeching

363
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:45,519
events. Uh a similar effect in terms of

364
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:47,839
phosphorus but mainly especially uh we

365
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:50,799
saw significant effect uh in the

366
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:53,680
potassium. So uh as you can imagine

367
00:16:50,799 --> 00:16:56,240
potassium is a positively charged ion in

368
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:58,479
the soil and when we have uh when we

369
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:00,399
apply these particles with a high

370
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:03,360
negative potential. So we found that

371
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:06,160
they were attracting these potassium ion

372
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:08,480
a lot more and uh even though we didn't

373
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:10,720
kind of nail down this but we we also

374
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:13,759
thought that because of this uh

375
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:16,640
potassium we also saw some bio stimul

376
00:17:13,759 --> 00:17:18,240
stimulating effect on the plants was

377
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:21,520
mainly driven through this potassium

378
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:23,160
uptake uh with these nanoparticles even

379
00:17:21,519 --> 00:17:25,119
though we couldn't kind of like

380
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:27,679
mechanistically prove that through our

381
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:31,918
study but uh recent studies have also

382
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:33,919
kind of like uh indicated that

383
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:37,679
uh we looked at soil ecology mainly

384
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:41,520
focused on bacteria here. Uh we found

385
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:43,759
that when we applied uh these nanop

386
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:46,639
particles there were a lot more unique

387
00:17:43,759 --> 00:17:50,000
uh genera of bacteria that we that we

388
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:51,919
are seeing in the soil. Uh again that

389
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,558
alone doesn't tell anything. It could be

390
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:56,240
that there are new bacteria coming

391
00:17:54,558 --> 00:17:58,399
because there's a new particle or it

392
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:01,359
could be that it's just enhancing the

393
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:03,840
diversity of the soil. So this work is

394
00:18:01,359 --> 00:18:06,319
still a work in progress I would say. We

395
00:18:03,839 --> 00:18:08,720
also looked at different film of of

396
00:18:06,319 --> 00:18:10,798
bacteria that were that were in the

397
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:13,600
treatments and we found that both biotar

398
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:16,240
and also uh low application rates of

399
00:18:13,599 --> 00:18:17,759
these nanop particles were uh

400
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:21,359
significantly increasing the

401
00:18:17,759 --> 00:18:23,919
cyanobacteria in the soil uh which are

402
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:26,879
kind of responsible or related to

403
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:29,360
nitrogen fixation and also uh nitrogen

404
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:32,000
cycling in the soil. So we uh we haven't

405
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:33,439
done the functional uh stuff yet, but

406
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,359
that's uh that's something we're

407
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:39,519
planning to do hopefully

408
00:18:36,359 --> 00:18:42,798
soon. Uh so yeah, we did a bunch of

409
00:18:39,519 --> 00:18:46,319
greenhouse uh column leing and soil

410
00:18:42,798 --> 00:18:48,798
ecological studies and then we we were

411
00:18:46,319 --> 00:18:51,200
finally kind of confident enough to try

412
00:18:48,798 --> 00:18:53,240
these in the field. Uh this was the

413
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:55,919
research field.

414
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:59,120
uh okay I could have given this a little

415
00:18:55,919 --> 00:19:00,960
bit earlier but uh bit more about these

416
00:18:59,119 --> 00:19:04,558
nanop particles so these are generated

417
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:06,319
from carbon black these have caroxil

418
00:19:04,558 --> 00:19:08,200
functional group and they have pH in the

419
00:19:06,319 --> 00:19:12,079
range of

420
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:14,880
5.5 high negative ga potential and a

421
00:19:12,079 --> 00:19:18,960
particle size in the range of 20 to 130

422
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:20,640
nano meters uh compared to biochar so

423
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:23,440
these were generated from the oak wood

424
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:26,080
residue that we have in Florida much

425
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:30,240
more carbon and much more higher pets

426
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:32,079
compared to uh these nanop particles. So

427
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:34,960
we did a field study this was not a

428
00:19:32,079 --> 00:19:40,399
rotation so two nearby fields with sugar

429
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:42,798
beat uh and corn. So I guess the only

430
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:46,000
main difference in ter in terms of soil

431
00:19:42,798 --> 00:19:48,558
in these two experiments was uh we lined

432
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:51,679
the p uh lined the bead field before

433
00:19:48,558 --> 00:19:53,918
study because a beet was a lot more

434
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:57,440
sensitive to low ps but also we wanted

435
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:59,840
to see uh the effect of these materials

436
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:03,038
in different ps. So it kind of like uh

437
00:19:59,839 --> 00:20:04,599
and corn was not uh limed before the

438
00:20:03,038 --> 00:20:08,000
study.

439
00:20:04,599 --> 00:20:11,678
So and looking at the eels uh we saw

440
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:16,240
that again similar to what we saw before

441
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:18,798
we saw significant increase in a leaf

442
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:22,880
suit biomass and also root biomass here

443
00:20:18,798 --> 00:20:25,319
in in terms of sugar beat with uh around

444
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:28,559
200 to 400 ppm application of these

445
00:20:25,319 --> 00:20:31,599
particles. So roughly about 20 to 24%

446
00:20:28,558 --> 00:20:33,759
increase in yield and uh as we we didn't

447
00:20:31,599 --> 00:20:36,319
go as high this time but we we could see

448
00:20:33,759 --> 00:20:38,558
that the the increase in yield was

449
00:20:36,319 --> 00:20:41,678
starting to seize uh as we increase the

450
00:20:38,558 --> 00:20:47,158
application rates. Uh with biochar we

451
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:50,480
didn't have a significant effect.

452
00:20:47,159 --> 00:20:53,840
Uh and similarly in corn we also saw

453
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:56,159
that uh there was a spike in terms of

454
00:20:53,839 --> 00:20:58,240
corn yields with these uh with these

455
00:20:56,159 --> 00:21:02,880
nanop particles and we saw ill responses

456
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:05,279
up to about uh 400 mgram per kg for corn

457
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:08,799
and we're getting quite good yields of

458
00:21:05,279 --> 00:21:11,359
corn with these particles. So uh I think

459
00:21:08,798 --> 00:21:13,440
last year starting last year we had our

460
00:21:11,359 --> 00:21:14,439
first onfarmm experiment with these

461
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:17,840
particles

462
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:20,240
and I'm hearing that uh the farmers are

463
00:21:17,839 --> 00:21:23,279
quite excited about these particles.

464
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:25,919
We couldn't do that during my time but

465
00:21:23,279 --> 00:21:28,639
uh anyways obvious questions what's

466
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:32,520
driving these eel eel gains with uh

467
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:34,960
nanop particles uh overall uh soil

468
00:21:32,519 --> 00:21:37,279
biogeeochemistry especially how the

469
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:39,519
nutrients react to these particles and

470
00:21:37,279 --> 00:21:42,119
how these particles are increasing the

471
00:21:39,519 --> 00:21:45,119
nutrient retention uh in the soil

472
00:21:42,119 --> 00:21:46,759
profile. We also saw that uh through our

473
00:21:45,119 --> 00:21:51,839
field

474
00:21:46,759 --> 00:21:54,879
studies. So uh we looked at soil pH and

475
00:21:51,839 --> 00:21:57,839
EC. So uh different dates we sample the

476
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:59,960
soils 30 70 and 110

477
00:21:57,839 --> 00:22:03,839
uh and different treatments

478
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:06,240
here. So the blue one here is what we're

479
00:22:03,839 --> 00:22:09,279
comparing. This is the standard practice

480
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:11,359
and uh the black one here is bioar and

481
00:22:09,279 --> 00:22:13,359
these four are uh the carbon

482
00:22:11,359 --> 00:22:16,079
nanoparticle treatments uh with

483
00:22:13,359 --> 00:22:18,240
increasing rates of application. So we

484
00:22:16,079 --> 00:22:19,000
found that both carbon nanop particles

485
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:22,720
and

486
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:25,200
biochar ra soil pads uh in these in

487
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:29,279
these soils both in limed and unlined

488
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:31,919
conditions and it reduced uh soil ec

489
00:22:29,279 --> 00:22:33,759
electrical conductivity. So basically it

490
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:37,440
increased the buffering capacity of

491
00:22:33,759 --> 00:22:40,640
these soils and as a result of this we

492
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:43,679
saw that a nutrient retention was a lot

493
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:45,759
more increased with nanop particles not

494
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:48,080
so much with biochar even though there

495
00:22:45,759 --> 00:22:50,400
was some increase we didn't see as

496
00:22:48,079 --> 00:22:53,359
significant effect but especially during

497
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:56,400
mid-season we found there was a lot more

498
00:22:53,359 --> 00:22:59,359
uh nitrate uh nitrogen with these uh

499
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:01,280
nanoparticle treatment and we I don't

500
00:22:59,359 --> 00:23:04,240
present that here But when we look we

501
00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:08,000
analyze the leaves of these corn and and

502
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:10,480
bead plants we saw a significant spike

503
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,960
of nitrogen in the mid-season treatment

504
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:14,720
as well. So it was throughout our

505
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:17,440
greenhouse and field studies and

506
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:19,480
different crops. Uh again we saw a

507
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:22,000
significant effect uh in

508
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:24,880
mid-season potassium especially and it

509
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:27,679
was really almost linear. So we could

510
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:29,679
really see that potassium was uh

511
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:36,000
retained in soil and it was being also

512
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:39,840
uptaken uh by by the plants. Uh again we

513
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:42,359
didn't uh look this directly but we also

514
00:23:39,839 --> 00:23:44,959
saw an increase in potassium with

515
00:23:42,359 --> 00:23:46,839
biochar but when we looked at our leaf

516
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:50,319
samples uh we didn't

517
00:23:46,839 --> 00:23:52,879
see we didn't see a similar increase in

518
00:23:50,319 --> 00:23:55,678
uh in uptake of potassium by the plants.

519
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:57,520
So again we don't know for sure yet but

520
00:23:55,679 --> 00:24:00,559
I think both the particles were kind of

521
00:23:57,519 --> 00:24:03,200
able to retain more nutrients but carbon

522
00:24:00,558 --> 00:24:05,038
nanop particle was able to supply these

523
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:07,038
nutrient to the plant more readily as

524
00:24:05,038 --> 00:24:09,839
opposed to biotar

525
00:24:07,038 --> 00:24:12,319
uh in which was kind of holding more

526
00:24:09,839 --> 00:24:14,439
nutrients but the supply was not as uh

527
00:24:12,319 --> 00:24:16,720
similar to the nanop

528
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:19,200
particles. Again that could be also

529
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:21,360
because biochar kind of requires more

530
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:24,240
incubation time compared to nanop

531
00:24:21,359 --> 00:24:27,839
particles because it's uh it's a much

532
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:30,359
larger surface area. Uh similar case uh

533
00:24:27,839 --> 00:24:33,079
we looked at uh the microbial

534
00:24:30,359 --> 00:24:35,839
respiration biomass all the biological

535
00:24:33,079 --> 00:24:38,079
indicators we found a spike at low

536
00:24:35,839 --> 00:24:40,879
application rates uh throughout the

537
00:24:38,079 --> 00:24:43,119
treatments. And as we uh increase our

538
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:45,360
application rates, we could see that uh

539
00:24:43,119 --> 00:24:47,278
these microbial indicators uh

540
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:50,399
consistently were being reduced at

541
00:24:47,278 --> 00:24:53,119
higher application rates. So and that

542
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:56,120
could be because of a potential hermetic

543
00:24:53,119 --> 00:24:58,239
effect which basically means that at low

544
00:24:56,119 --> 00:25:00,558
application there's a positive effect

545
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:03,919
and that either seizes or you start to

546
00:25:00,558 --> 00:25:06,079
have uh some kind of negative effect at

547
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:09,120
high application rates. uh pretty

548
00:25:06,079 --> 00:25:11,599
similar in in case of uh the enzyme

549
00:25:09,119 --> 00:25:14,399
activities although it was significant

550
00:25:11,599 --> 00:25:17,119
only for the ura enzyme which is

551
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:20,080
responsible for nitrogen but we also saw

552
00:25:17,119 --> 00:25:22,319
oops uh a decline as we increase the

553
00:25:20,079 --> 00:25:26,158
rate in terms of the enzyatic activity

554
00:25:22,319 --> 00:25:28,720
of the soil. So overall we found that

555
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:31,919
carbon nanop particles increased both

556
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:35,120
corn and sugar beet yields in the field

557
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:39,240
both enhanced the buffering capacity

558
00:25:35,119 --> 00:25:41,678
uh of our soils. Carbon nanop particles

559
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:43,200
especially both particles also increase

560
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:45,600
the nutrient retention but carbon

561
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:50,480
nanoparticles increase the leaf uh

562
00:25:45,599 --> 00:25:52,798
uptake of uh NPK and we found that at

563
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:54,720
higher application rates uh the

564
00:25:52,798 --> 00:25:57,038
microbial activities was seized but at

565
00:25:54,720 --> 00:26:00,079
lower activities there was an increase

566
00:25:57,038 --> 00:26:03,200
in soil microbial activities and we also

567
00:26:00,079 --> 00:26:06,798
did some uh ecological analysis here and

568
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:09,720
we found pretty similar uh results

569
00:26:06,798 --> 00:26:13,200
compared like like the field

570
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:16,079
studies. So, uh that's that's about it

571
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:16,080
for my PhD

572
00:26:16,759 --> 00:26:25,119
work. I joined Ryan Lab last year 2024

573
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:28,480
and I was involved in a couple of

574
00:26:25,119 --> 00:26:30,000
projects uh different cover crops uh

575
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:31,679
based projects. So, I'm going to talk a

576
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,558
little about the organic cropping

577
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:37,440
systems experiment that we have and uh

578
00:26:34,558 --> 00:26:39,599
this is the 20th anniversary. So

579
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:41,200
essentially we have four different

580
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:43,599
treatments here or four different

581
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:46,319
philosophies of how we can manage

582
00:26:43,599 --> 00:26:49,038
organic systems uh high fertility

583
00:26:46,319 --> 00:26:50,798
systems here we are increasing the the

584
00:26:49,038 --> 00:26:53,519
amendments and fertilizer that we are

585
00:26:50,798 --> 00:26:56,639
applying to the soil. So a lot higher

586
00:26:53,519 --> 00:26:59,200
about 50% higher fertilizer than uh than

587
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:01,600
the low low fertility treatment. In the

588
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:03,519
low fertility we are relying a lot more

589
00:27:01,599 --> 00:27:06,480
on the ecological processes such as

590
00:27:03,519 --> 00:27:10,400
incorporating legumes to provide that uh

591
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:12,798
sort of deficient uh soil fertility. So

592
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:16,798
uh so two gradients of fertility and two

593
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:19,278
gradients of uh weed management uh

594
00:27:16,798 --> 00:27:21,918
enhanced weed management. Uh here we

595
00:27:19,278 --> 00:27:25,119
have more intensive weed management uh

596
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:28,240
multiple passes to control weeds versus

597
00:27:25,119 --> 00:27:30,239
a reduced tage treat uh treatment or

598
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:32,880
philosophy where we're reducing the

599
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:36,720
tillage and trying to manage weed more

600
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:41,600
culturally such as u uh using a mulch uh

601
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:42,839
and things like that. So and uh so the

602
00:27:41,599 --> 00:27:45,839
crops were

603
00:27:42,839 --> 00:27:48,079
grown in rotation different crops. There

604
00:27:45,839 --> 00:27:50,319
are two entry points. It's a little bit

605
00:27:48,079 --> 00:27:53,599
complicated if I go through all of these

606
00:27:50,319 --> 00:27:56,398
but what I was looking mainly was

607
00:27:53,599 --> 00:27:59,278
uh we're comparing how these four

608
00:27:56,398 --> 00:28:01,519
treatments uh lined up in terms of soil

609
00:27:59,278 --> 00:28:04,720
health indicators and we were comparing

610
00:28:01,519 --> 00:28:07,599
these to uh conventional corn fields. So

611
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:11,519
this was uh 80 years around 80 years of

612
00:28:07,599 --> 00:28:14,240
conventional corn. Uh and then this

613
00:28:11,519 --> 00:28:16,798
treatment right here is is the alley. So

614
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:19,200
this is the grass alleys in between in

615
00:28:16,798 --> 00:28:21,480
between the treatments. So uh mainly

616
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:23,600
looking at uh the conventional corn

617
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:25,919
versus the four different treatments.

618
00:28:23,599 --> 00:28:28,119
And we could see that compared to the

619
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:32,159
conventional oops that

620
00:28:28,119 --> 00:28:34,000
was not the right click. All right. So

621
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:36,559
uh compared to the conventional corn we

622
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,720
saw a significant effect uh in terms of

623
00:28:36,558 --> 00:28:41,759
soil aggregate stability with the

624
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:45,200
organic systems uh the letters are

625
00:28:41,759 --> 00:28:46,720
slightly off here but uh irrespective of

626
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:49,120
different philosophies or treatments

627
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:49,960
that we're using we could see uh an

628
00:28:49,119 --> 00:28:53,278
increase

629
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:56,399
in uh the aggregation and soil structure

630
00:28:53,278 --> 00:28:59,119
throughout uh throughout these study. uh

631
00:28:56,398 --> 00:29:02,000
not as clear differences in terms of uh

632
00:28:59,119 --> 00:29:04,759
predictable soil protein and also uh

633
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:08,759
soil labile soil carbon the permanent

634
00:29:04,759 --> 00:29:11,200
manganate oxidizable soil carbon but

635
00:29:08,759 --> 00:29:13,119
overall when we looked at the overall

636
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:15,919
soil health score this is uh from the

637
00:29:13,119 --> 00:29:18,639
Cornell uh comprehensive soil health

638
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:21,840
assessment we saw that uh compared to

639
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:24,399
the corn and even compared to the alley

640
00:29:21,839 --> 00:29:27,158
the organic systems were consistently

641
00:29:24,398 --> 00:29:30,798
irrespective of the philosophy reads

642
00:29:27,159 --> 00:29:33,600
uh higher soil health indicators uh in

643
00:29:30,798 --> 00:29:35,278
these studies. So

644
00:29:33,599 --> 00:29:37,759
uh that was sort of the main thing that

645
00:29:35,278 --> 00:29:39,599
I looked at from this experiment. Uh

646
00:29:37,759 --> 00:29:42,079
another project that I was involved in

647
00:29:39,599 --> 00:29:45,199
was using the integrated cover crop

648
00:29:42,079 --> 00:29:48,480
experiment to control a white mold uh

649
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:51,120
which is a soybean uh disease and also

650
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:54,079
weeds uh in soybean and dry bean system.

651
00:29:51,119 --> 00:29:57,439
So basically what we're doing is uh we

652
00:29:54,079 --> 00:30:00,398
are planting the cover crop uh in the in

653
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:02,080
the fall September October cereal rye

654
00:30:00,398 --> 00:30:03,678
and we had three different treatments

655
00:30:02,079 --> 00:30:05,798
here

656
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:08,320
uh till two till

657
00:30:05,798 --> 00:30:11,200
treatments one without cover crop one

658
00:30:08,319 --> 00:30:15,439
with cover crop and one treatment that

659
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:18,798
has uh where the the cover crop is mowed

660
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:21,360
and a mat of cereal r formed uh for weed

661
00:30:18,798 --> 00:30:22,599
and also we found that uh it was

662
00:30:21,359 --> 00:30:26,000
effective

663
00:30:22,599 --> 00:30:27,918
in uh disease suppression. So two main

664
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,480
crops soybean and dry bean different

665
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:33,679
seeding rates and we evaluated different

666
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:34,519
plant parameters and analyzed these uh

667
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:37,519
in

668
00:30:34,519 --> 00:30:39,679
our I'm mainly going to focus on white

669
00:30:37,519 --> 00:30:42,798
mold uh because that was kind of like

670
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:45,200
the most distinct uh results that we saw

671
00:30:42,798 --> 00:30:47,119
from the study. So we here are the three

672
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:50,640
treatments the tills only without cover

673
00:30:47,119 --> 00:30:52,959
crop uh cover crop till treatment and

674
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:55,240
cover crop mulch treatment. So we we saw

675
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:59,679
that uh compared

676
00:30:55,240 --> 00:31:02,798
to both the the till treatments the the

677
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:06,399
treatment with the rye molds was able to

678
00:31:02,798 --> 00:31:10,639
reduce the white mold by almost uh 70 to

679
00:31:06,398 --> 00:31:13,119
80% uh across uh across soybean and in

680
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:16,159
both ears.

681
00:31:13,119 --> 00:31:18,798
So, so what is happening here is uh this

682
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:21,840
is the pathogen of white mold. So, what

683
00:31:18,798 --> 00:31:24,240
this is doing is by having the mulch

684
00:31:21,839 --> 00:31:26,000
protect the soil or cover the soil we

685
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:29,038
are reducing the the functional

686
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:31,599
germination of these epothesia. So, uh

687
00:31:29,038 --> 00:31:33,759
this is in the ry mulch treatment versus

688
00:31:31,599 --> 00:31:36,798
this is the trill treatment. So and this

689
00:31:33,759 --> 00:31:39,519
is uh why because of the reduction in

690
00:31:36,798 --> 00:31:41,960
the spores produced uh we could we were

691
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:45,440
seeing a reduction

692
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:47,919
in white mold. Uh in terms of weed

693
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:51,200
biomass and density we saw an overall

694
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:52,799
reduction in white b weed biomass with

695
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:55,679
uh the ry mulch treatment. There was

696
00:31:52,798 --> 00:31:58,720
some variation across years here. This

697
00:31:55,679 --> 00:32:01,278
is the uh weed density. So uh we think

698
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:03,200
that some of these high numbers is

699
00:32:01,278 --> 00:32:05,759
because uh there was a regrowth in

700
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:08,919
cereal rye which was also counted as

701
00:32:05,759 --> 00:32:11,278
weed and and because there is uh not

702
00:32:08,919 --> 00:32:13,679
really big difference in biomass. So

703
00:32:11,278 --> 00:32:16,159
it's uh kind of like counting more small

704
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:18,960
plants but not really turning into a big

705
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:20,200
biomass that is competing uh in terms of

706
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:23,038
weed

707
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:26,480
pressure. Uh we looked at the eel there

708
00:32:23,038 --> 00:32:28,640
was a variation across years. So in 2020

709
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:31,919
uh the yield were pretty similar among

710
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:37,440
the treatments versus in 2019 in soybean

711
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:40,559
we had uh about 20% yield reduction. So

712
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:45,440
uh and in dry bean there was about 20%

713
00:32:40,558 --> 00:32:48,000
yield reduction uh in 2020. So again

714
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:50,640
depending on probably weather and also

715
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:55,119
uh there could be room for optimizing

716
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:55,120
planting rates uh in dry bin

717
00:32:55,159 --> 00:33:02,080
especially. So that's uh that's about it

718
00:32:58,398 --> 00:33:06,719
from my postto with Brian lab and now

719
00:33:02,079 --> 00:33:08,960
I'm uh in my second postural adventure

720
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:11,839
uh with the vegetable crop science lab

721
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:13,840
at Penn State. So here kind of switching

722
00:33:11,839 --> 00:33:17,158
gears into more vegetables and

723
00:33:13,839 --> 00:33:19,599
horicultural crops uh and different

724
00:33:17,159 --> 00:33:23,278
systems. Uh the main project that I'll

725
00:33:19,599 --> 00:33:25,359
be working uh working at Penn State is

726
00:33:23,278 --> 00:33:29,119
sort of regenerating or improving the

727
00:33:25,359 --> 00:33:30,639
soil health of uh through anorobic soil

728
00:33:29,119 --> 00:33:33,199
disinfestation

729
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:35,038
uh to manage disease weeds and soil

730
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:37,600
health in organic vegetable production

731
00:33:35,038 --> 00:33:40,240
system. So this is uh going to be the

732
00:33:37,599 --> 00:33:41,839
main project that I'll be working on.

733
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:44,720
We'll have a bunch of different

734
00:33:41,839 --> 00:33:47,038
greenhouse and field studies. So

735
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:49,200
essentially what we're doing is amending

736
00:33:47,038 --> 00:33:51,679
the soil

737
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:53,360
uh with readily decomposible carbon

738
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:56,000
source

739
00:33:53,359 --> 00:33:59,199
uh and then muling the soil with kind of

740
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:01,839
like covering the soil with uh oxygen

741
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:04,480
impermeable film to to induce the the

742
00:34:01,839 --> 00:34:06,720
anorobic condition in the soil. And then

743
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:09,039
we are irrigating the soil until

744
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:12,079
saturation and leaving it for about a

745
00:34:09,039 --> 00:34:16,320
month and then opening the film and then

746
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:20,000
going with a uh a vegetable crop tomato

747
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:22,639
or cucumber and to see uh to see effect

748
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:25,838
in soil health uh and also crop

749
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:27,519
production. So yeah, another thing that

750
00:34:25,838 --> 00:34:31,599
we are trying to kind of like add to

751
00:34:27,519 --> 00:34:34,719
this uh from this year is uh to try to

752
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:36,800
use a more local locally available

753
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:39,598
carbon sources. So we're looking at

754
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:43,000
molasses which is a byproduct of sugar

755
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:46,879
can uh industry wheat mlings which are a

756
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:49,119
byproduct from wheat and also poultry

757
00:34:46,878 --> 00:34:53,519
manure or chicken manure. So using them

758
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:57,200
as carbon and nitrogen source uh to to

759
00:34:53,519 --> 00:34:59,119
optimize the anorobic uh treatment and

760
00:34:57,199 --> 00:35:02,559
we're also trying to integrate different

761
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:06,240
cover crops. So we're looking at uh

762
00:35:02,559 --> 00:35:10,039
tritical I think and crimson clover. So

763
00:35:06,239 --> 00:35:12,479
two different cover crops uh uh to

764
00:35:10,039 --> 00:35:16,039
induce uh to provide the source of

765
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:20,000
carbon to induce anorobic conditions.

766
00:35:16,039 --> 00:35:23,920
So yeah that's about it because yeah

767
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:27,280
this is a work in progress. So overall

768
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:30,159
again bunch of different research one

769
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:32,320
direction to another. Uh but overall I

770
00:35:30,159 --> 00:35:35,279
think uh what I was what is pretty clear

771
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:38,720
is that uh management how we manage our

772
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:41,839
soils is is really key to how it how the

773
00:35:38,719 --> 00:35:44,639
soil fertility is affected but weather

774
00:35:41,838 --> 00:35:46,400
environment also has a big role. So

775
00:35:44,639 --> 00:35:50,078
whenever we are trying to model our

776
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:52,000
systems or amendments uh it is it is

777
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:53,720
critical that we we take weather into

778
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:56,719
account

779
00:35:53,719 --> 00:35:59,358
uh there's not one single practice or

780
00:35:56,719 --> 00:36:01,919
system that that that can be adopted for

781
00:35:59,358 --> 00:36:04,719
for for one reason that you can say that

782
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:07,440
is universally successful or this works.

783
00:36:04,719 --> 00:36:08,959
So yeah there's sometimes it works with

784
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:11,440
one practice sometime you have to

785
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:14,800
combine different uh different things to

786
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:18,599
get uh the desired results. Uh again

787
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:22,240
each system respond differently based on

788
00:36:18,599 --> 00:36:24,320
practice. Uh similar stuff. Uh the big

789
00:36:22,239 --> 00:36:26,799
challenge I guess uh I talked a lot

790
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:31,200
about soil amendments. Uh the big

791
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:33,599
challenge again is uh how do we provide

792
00:36:31,199 --> 00:36:35,199
these uh amendments to the farmers is

793
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:38,079
always a big challenge. So whether we

794
00:36:35,199 --> 00:36:40,879
talk about biochar or nanop particles to

795
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:44,320
scale up to actually make it uh

796
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:46,240
applicable in the large field context is

797
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:49,359
or remains a challenge. So I think in

798
00:36:46,239 --> 00:36:52,719
this uh we might need more help from the

799
00:36:49,358 --> 00:36:55,279
industry or uh kind of collaborate with

800
00:36:52,719 --> 00:36:58,480
uh different stakeholders. So anyways,

801
00:36:55,280 --> 00:37:01,519
moving forward sort of kind of where I

802
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:05,599
see myself uh going forward uh in terms

803
00:37:01,519 --> 00:37:08,239
of my my ideas uh based on my experience

804
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:10,400
uh continue the soil fertility research

805
00:37:08,239 --> 00:37:13,118
trying new amendments different

806
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:15,599
management practices but also uh sort of

807
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:18,079
look at the soil health uh together with

808
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:21,680
soil fertility is going to be important

809
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:23,440
and also uh I am really interested in

810
00:37:21,679 --> 00:37:26,319
kind of like looking it from a system

811
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:28,559
point of view and sort of like uh work

812
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:30,880
towards building a system rather than

813
00:37:28,559 --> 00:37:33,000
only kind of one management practice or

814
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:36,160
one

815
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:38,960
amendment. Uh again different ecosystems

816
00:37:36,159 --> 00:37:41,199
different uh different amendments or

817
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:43,679
different practices respond differently.

818
00:37:41,199 --> 00:37:45,759
In some systems bioar seems to perform

819
00:37:43,679 --> 00:37:48,799
much better compared to even cover crops

820
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:52,240
while in other systems uh cover crops

821
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:54,640
per perform a lot better. So uh just to

822
00:37:52,239 --> 00:37:58,078
provide a context as even though biochar

823
00:37:54,639 --> 00:38:00,159
was not like really stand out in some of

824
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:02,880
my studies but there are some some

825
00:38:00,159 --> 00:38:05,920
studies that have that show that biochar

826
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:07,838
can increase soil organic carbon much uh

827
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:10,480
better than even cover crops depending

828
00:38:07,838 --> 00:38:12,400
on the management uh weather again in

829
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:15,280
the systems.

830
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:18,079
uh using ecological principles to to

831
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:20,880
look at soil fertility, soil health uh

832
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:23,880
but also looking at ways we can prevent

833
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:27,280
losses, reducing erosion and also

834
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:31,119
minimizing uh degradation of ecosystems.

835
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:34,640
And finally I guess uh sort of thinking

836
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:37,680
soil health uh putting the soil health

837
00:38:34,639 --> 00:38:40,879
concept in in this whole one health

838
00:38:37,679 --> 00:38:43,358
concept uh because we also work with

839
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:45,039
different diseases a lot of diseases and

840
00:38:43,358 --> 00:38:48,639
I'm going to work with diseases in my

841
00:38:45,039 --> 00:38:51,279
current project. So trying to combine uh

842
00:38:48,639 --> 00:38:53,519
plant disease soil disease everything

843
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:56,079
into this one health concept. So that is

844
00:38:53,519 --> 00:39:00,079
something I'm thinking more and more uh

845
00:38:56,079 --> 00:39:03,440
these days. So yeah, with that uh we'd

846
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:05,839
like to take any questions.

847
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:08,400
Thank you very much for your talk. Um a

848
00:39:05,838 --> 00:39:10,480
lot of interesting data. I was uh c

849
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:14,000
curious about two things. Actually there

850
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:16,320
were many but um you you said that the

851
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:18,559
carbon nanom materials were negatively

852
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:20,880
charged. Yeah. Did they come so out of

853
00:39:18,559 --> 00:39:22,320
the box? Did you choose them? Because

854
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:23,599
I'm familiar that a lot of carbon

855
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:25,280
nanomater materials are not charged at

856
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:27,359
all and they shouldn't be if they're

857
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:29,760
just graphine sheets. There's no charge

858
00:39:27,358 --> 00:39:31,920
on them. Or did you did you oxidize them

859
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:34,480
in some way and you Yeah. Yeah. These

860
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:37,280
Yeah. Yeah. these were oxidized to have

861
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:39,199
the caroxil groups. So that that's where

862
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:43,760
the charge is coming from. And you used

863
00:39:39,199 --> 00:39:45,838
what? Peroxide. Uh oxidiz some kind of

864
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:47,599
oxidizer. I'll have to check on that.

865
00:39:45,838 --> 00:39:49,199
But yeah, it was oxidized to have that

866
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:51,280
caroxil group and that's where the

867
00:39:49,199 --> 00:39:53,838
charge is coming from. Yeah. Can I

868
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:55,359
follow up on yes question? I was excited

869
00:39:53,838 --> 00:39:57,358
to see that the especially the carbon

870
00:39:55,358 --> 00:39:58,960
nanom materials didn't have really a

871
00:39:57,358 --> 00:40:00,960
high pH. You might have been

872
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:04,079
disappointed but I'm excited because

873
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:06,240
that excludes sort of pH correction from

874
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:09,039
the possible effects and you can really

875
00:40:06,239 --> 00:40:12,959
focus on maybe nutrient retention. Yes.

876
00:40:09,039 --> 00:40:15,838
Um but then I saw that your soil pH did

877
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:18,639
change. So, but they had 5.5. The soil

878
00:40:15,838 --> 00:40:21,039
had five to six. So, why did the pH

879
00:40:18,639 --> 00:40:23,519
change in the soil when you added

880
00:40:21,039 --> 00:40:26,400
something that had basically the same pH

881
00:40:23,519 --> 00:40:28,639
the soil was? What was that all about?

882
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:31,119
Yeah, that is something that made us c

883
00:40:28,639 --> 00:40:34,159
curious as well and we did this study in

884
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:36,559
bunch of different ped soils to see if

885
00:40:34,159 --> 00:40:38,000
that's happening. So, yeah, it was

886
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:41,279
interesting. We were seeing this effect

887
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:44,000
much more in these in more like like

888
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:46,160
really acidic soils and in those alpha

889
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:48,400
soil the increase in PS with these nanop

890
00:40:46,159 --> 00:40:50,639
particles was not as much even though

891
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:53,440
there was some. So yeah, we couldn't

892
00:40:50,639 --> 00:40:57,199
really kind of like pinpoint where this

893
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:59,720
uh increase is coming from. Yeah, it was

894
00:40:57,199 --> 00:41:04,399
Thank you. Thank you. I said that to

895
00:40:59,719 --> 00:41:06,799
you. I was like everybody there.

896
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:09,358
Um just another question on the carbon

897
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:11,440
nanop particles. Um make it sound like

898
00:41:09,358 --> 00:41:13,358
it's very positive across the board

899
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:14,639
especially in coarse textured soils. Um

900
00:41:13,358 --> 00:41:17,838
what are kind of the challenges and

901
00:41:14,639 --> 00:41:20,559
limitations of using it? Yeah, I think

902
00:41:17,838 --> 00:41:23,440
because we're seeing uh kind of like a

903
00:41:20,559 --> 00:41:24,599
decline or negative impact in especially

904
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:27,920
in the soil

905
00:41:24,599 --> 00:41:30,318
microbial aspect at the higher doses. I

906
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:33,039
think uh whether or not they accumulate

907
00:41:30,318 --> 00:41:34,639
in the soil for longer time uh is going

908
00:41:33,039 --> 00:41:37,599
to be challenged. So if you kind of like

909
00:41:34,639 --> 00:41:40,879
keep applying nano particles for again

910
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:43,119
and again uh they might accumulate and

911
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:45,440
uh so I think uh that's why I think

912
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:47,920
having that life cycle assessment is

913
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:51,119
important and that's uh it's happening

914
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:53,519
currently at UCF I believe so I could

915
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:57,119
see that being uh something that could

916
00:41:53,519 --> 00:41:58,480
be a concern but in terms of like seeing

917
00:41:57,119 --> 00:42:01,440
seeing the effect we could see

918
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:01,440
throughout our studies.

919
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:06,159
sort of follow up on that sort of the

920
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:08,318
comparison of the biochar versus versus

921
00:42:06,159 --> 00:42:10,480
the nanop particles in one of the graphs

922
00:42:08,318 --> 00:42:13,119
that you showed you saw this for you're

923
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:16,719
looking at EC you showed that the the

924
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:20,640
the biochar had a dramatic uh effect on

925
00:42:16,719 --> 00:42:24,078
EC lowering it much more than the the

926
00:42:20,639 --> 00:42:26,639
nanoparticles yes and and yet you had

927
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:28,880
much higher levels when you rinse them

928
00:42:26,639 --> 00:42:32,480
off with mic or however you did that

929
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:35,519
Yeah. Higher levels. So what was going

930
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:37,679
on there? I mean were did you have

931
00:42:35,519 --> 00:42:40,800
different CECs? I mean clearly you had a

932
00:42:37,679 --> 00:42:43,279
measurement of what their charge was.

933
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:45,760
You have a a measurement of their total

934
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:47,920
charge per volume.

935
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:51,119
No we didn't measure that total charge

936
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:54,480
per volume. No. So the CC sort of base

937
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:57,680
saturation component was not there. So

938
00:42:54,480 --> 00:43:00,400
this could have been effect of just

939
00:42:57,679 --> 00:43:04,000
nutrient efficiency and fert fertilizer

940
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:06,720
could be fertilizer. Yeah.

941
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:08,559
Good point though.

942
00:43:06,719 --> 00:43:10,559
Thank you. You told me the carbon

943
00:43:08,559 --> 00:43:13,358
particle increase the corn yield and

944
00:43:10,559 --> 00:43:15,358
that's very useful information for the

945
00:43:13,358 --> 00:43:17,358
corn production systems. So I'm

946
00:43:15,358 --> 00:43:20,159
wondering which parameters either

947
00:43:17,358 --> 00:43:22,880
parameters could be increased for number

948
00:43:20,159 --> 00:43:26,318
of cops or grain corner numbers per cops

949
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:28,960
or corner weight square. Yeah, I think

950
00:43:26,318 --> 00:43:33,119
uh we did that study but I think overall

951
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:36,559
we we saw the uh how to say the the

952
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:38,800
sizes of the of the kernel was the was

953
00:43:36,559 --> 00:43:40,838
the thing that was most increased across

954
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:43,760
the treatments. I would

955
00:43:40,838 --> 00:43:46,159
say should have that data somewhere so I

956
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:48,160
can check that.

957
00:43:46,159 --> 00:43:50,000
Kind of a basic topical question but

958
00:43:48,159 --> 00:43:52,719
when you started the presentation you

959
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:54,480
mentioned about the burning problem uh

960
00:43:52,719 --> 00:43:57,279
and the emissions of like burning all

961
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:59,280
this rice residue. Uh how does the

962
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:01,440
production of biochar compare in terms

963
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:04,720
of emissions? Is it does it lower

964
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:07,838
emissions and improve air quality of the

965
00:44:04,719 --> 00:44:10,959
ovens that you use or

966
00:44:07,838 --> 00:44:13,199
Yeah. I mean one thing it does like

967
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:16,000
directly is that if you burn something

968
00:44:13,199 --> 00:44:18,078
in the field you you affect the soil

969
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:20,159
also soil microbes and it it goes

970
00:44:18,079 --> 00:44:22,400
directly into environment as opposed to

971
00:44:20,159 --> 00:44:23,960
biotar it's much more controlled so it's

972
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:26,559
a controlled

973
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:29,800
burning but in terms of like comparing

974
00:44:26,559 --> 00:44:33,519
the exact

975
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:38,240
numbers I don't have that

976
00:44:33,519 --> 00:44:39,920
basic question the black the source of

977
00:44:38,239 --> 00:44:42,879
That

978
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:46,680
what what is that in terms of

979
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:49,200
resourcing? Yeah, it is

980
00:44:46,679 --> 00:44:52,318
basically in in a layman kind of term,

981
00:44:49,199 --> 00:44:55,838
it is something that that remains in the

982
00:44:52,318 --> 00:44:58,800
industrial kilm when you burn uh

983
00:44:55,838 --> 00:45:02,559
something with carbon. So if for example

984
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:05,200
if you burn a crop residue for example

985
00:45:02,559 --> 00:45:07,358
uh so basically how they're the the

986
00:45:05,199 --> 00:45:09,519
wolves company is the one who is

987
00:45:07,358 --> 00:45:12,000
processing that and they're kind of like

988
00:45:09,519 --> 00:45:14,800
outsourcing those carbon black that is

989
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:17,119
that gets stuck to those kils and

990
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:20,560
they're using that to pre uh oxidize it

991
00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:22,480
to to make these particles. So that's

992
00:45:20,559 --> 00:45:23,838
kind of like one way. There are

993
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:26,480
different ways they're they're doing it,

994
00:45:23,838 --> 00:45:28,799
but this is kind of like the cheapest uh

995
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:30,559
way to produce things. They're burning

996
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:33,280
the other material. What are they doing

997
00:45:30,559 --> 00:45:36,880
with the other material that's not stuck

998
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:40,560
to the kil? Uh that is probably used for

999
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:42,240
other things that I I don't know this.

1000
00:45:40,559 --> 00:45:43,400
Why? Yeah. I mean, yeah, I was trying to

1001
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:47,838
figure out what

1002
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:50,240
the source situation is and how that

1003
00:45:47,838 --> 00:45:52,078
applies to get then sounds like the more

1004
00:45:50,239 --> 00:45:55,039
minimal amount of material that's being

1005
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:58,079
used for this other process

1006
00:45:55,039 --> 00:46:00,318
and quantifying it to go to scale. Yeah,

1007
00:45:58,079 --> 00:46:05,280
that's a big challenge. And yeah, we're

1008
00:46:00,318 --> 00:46:08,800
doing some like cost analysis also uh to

1009
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:10,640
see if it like stacks up. And that's why

1010
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:12,400
I mentioned the the scrapping of the

1011
00:46:10,639 --> 00:46:14,960
kiln thing cuz that was the only thing

1012
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:17,838
that looked kind of like economical in

1013
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:20,639
terms of what we can use as a source

1014
00:46:17,838 --> 00:46:24,519
longer term. But yeah, where exactly

1015
00:46:20,639 --> 00:46:26,759
they get that uh carbon black particle

1016
00:46:24,519 --> 00:46:29,039
from I don't

1017
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:31,920
know but yeah we're working with this

1018
00:46:29,039 --> 00:46:34,239
company and they were yeah they were

1019
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:36,200
giving us these particles and they're

1020
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:39,358
trying to scale it.

1021
00:46:36,199 --> 00:46:41,279
So good question. I could maybe ask like

1022
00:46:39,358 --> 00:46:43,119
from a sustainability perspective. I

1023
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:44,960
think that would be an important Yes.

1024
00:46:43,119 --> 00:46:47,599
Know what the other things are going on

1025
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:50,720
that create the resource that they gave

1026
00:46:47,599 --> 00:46:52,079
you. Yes.

1027
00:46:50,719 --> 00:46:55,039
Can I bring it back to the the

1028
00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:57,039
nanoparticle? Yes. The the nutrients

1029
00:46:55,039 --> 00:46:58,960
that you were So you're having you have

1030
00:46:57,039 --> 00:47:00,639
negative decharge.

1031
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:03,679
So the responses that were associated

1032
00:47:00,639 --> 00:47:06,000
with the nitrate versus the ammonium,

1033
00:47:03,679 --> 00:47:07,199
what differences did I didn't see it

1034
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,719
quick enough that Yeah. What kind of

1035
00:47:07,199 --> 00:47:11,199
responses were you seeing that were

1036
00:47:08,719 --> 00:47:12,559
different there? Yeah, we it was

1037
00:47:11,199 --> 00:47:15,199
interesting, but we were seeing a lot

1038
00:47:12,559 --> 00:47:17,519
more nitrate than ammonium. We're

1039
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:19,679
expecting more ammonium to be retained

1040
00:47:17,519 --> 00:47:21,440
because of the positive and negative

1041
00:47:19,679 --> 00:47:24,159
charge, but we are seeing a lot more

1042
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:26,240
nitrate compared to ammonium.

1043
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:27,838
Is that more like was it associated with

1044
00:47:26,239 --> 00:47:29,358
the moisture component of it? Yeah,

1045
00:47:27,838 --> 00:47:32,559
that's what we think because of the

1046
00:47:29,358 --> 00:47:35,838
humidity and yeah the moisture did you

1047
00:47:32,559 --> 00:47:37,599
measure water holding capacity uh with

1048
00:47:35,838 --> 00:47:39,559
the amendments versus non amendments?

1049
00:47:37,599 --> 00:47:41,920
No, we didn't do that.

1050
00:47:39,559 --> 00:47:43,920
No. Yeah, that's yeah, that's one thing

1051
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:47,039
we also noticed. I mean especially with

1052
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:50,318
the biochar treatments that it seemed

1053
00:47:47,039 --> 00:47:51,759
like the the structure and and those

1054
00:47:50,318 --> 00:47:55,599
components were a lot better with

1055
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:56,960
biochar but we didn't measure those.

1056
00:47:55,599 --> 00:48:00,480
Okay, if there are no other questions

1057
00:47:56,960 --> 00:48:02,920
let's uh thank Jay and
