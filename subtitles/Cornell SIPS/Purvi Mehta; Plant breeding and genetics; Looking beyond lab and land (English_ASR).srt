great to be here um I I wanted to sort

17
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:57,160
of start with um if this if I know how

18
00:00:55,679 --> 00:01:00,558
to operate

19
00:00:57,159 --> 00:01:02,959
this I wanted to start with a

20
00:01:00,558 --> 00:01:06,840
with a small story that many of you may

21
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:10,118
have heard um this is this is a story

22
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:12,359
from maybe I don't know 1500 years ago

23
00:01:10,118 --> 00:01:15,239
when there were no televisions it feels

24
00:01:12,359 --> 00:01:18,159
like 1500 years ago there were no

25
00:01:15,239 --> 00:01:20,798
televisions and no radios and no media

26
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:24,079
and people were pretty siloed in their

27
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:27,520
little countries wherever they were and

28
00:01:24,078 --> 00:01:30,438
in in in those days uh something like

29
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:34,039
this an animal like this landed let's

30
00:01:30,438 --> 00:01:37,319
say here in IA where nobody had ever

31
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:40,759
seen an elephant before so people

32
00:01:37,319 --> 00:01:45,359
started looking at this huge big thing

33
00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:47,680
that came and landed here in IA and

34
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:51,078
um different people had different

35
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:53,560
interpretation about and describing uh

36
00:01:51,078 --> 00:01:56,438
this this whole animal people who saw it

37
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:59,039
from the top thought it was a fan people

38
00:01:56,438 --> 00:02:01,478
who saw it from from the tail side

39
00:01:59,039 --> 00:02:03,478
thought it was a rope people some people

40
00:02:01,478 --> 00:02:06,599
thought it was a it was a poll some

41
00:02:03,478 --> 00:02:09,959
people who saw it from that side thought

42
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:12,120
it was a big huge pipe the biggest

43
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:15,239
problem is that you know different

44
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:17,640
people had different views in in

45
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:20,480
identifying this thing and different

46
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:23,518
people had different interpretation of

47
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:25,799
of what this this whole thing was the

48
00:02:23,519 --> 00:02:28,879
biggest challenge was that they did not

49
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:30,879
see it in a holistic way and looked at

50
00:02:28,878 --> 00:02:34,120
the elephant as an elephant and they did

51
00:02:30,878 --> 00:02:36,280
not recognize that I think uh you know

52
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:39,239
we all would agree that a lot of the

53
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:43,400
work that we do in agriculture right now

54
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:46,319
is is pretty similar um we we look at it

55
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:48,239
from many many different angles uh you

56
00:02:46,318 --> 00:02:49,919
know the the people in the private

57
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:52,759
sector for

58
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:55,318
example you know from a vantage point of

59
00:02:52,759 --> 00:02:57,359
of one of the fastest growing business

60
00:02:55,318 --> 00:02:59,958
in the world if we look at the seed

61
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:02,560
industry for example you know we we know

62
00:02:59,959 --> 00:03:04,840
why these large mergers are happening

63
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,878
these days and and last week for example

64
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:09,120
one of the largest merger there is

65
00:03:06,878 --> 00:03:11,318
tremendous potential in the private

66
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,840
sector in the way agriculture is growing

67
00:03:11,318 --> 00:03:15,878
for example as a business proposition if

68
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,878
you look at the seed Industries for

69
00:03:15,878 --> 00:03:21,079
example which is at about what I think

70
00:03:17,878 --> 00:03:24,518
about 53 billion right now is is in 5

71
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:28,280
years projected to be at about 93.6

72
00:03:24,519 --> 00:03:30,480
billion and and all this growth uh is is

73
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:32,120
mainly going to come from developing

74
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:33,959
countries and so if we look at the

75
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:37,519
private sector angle they look at it

76
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:40,519
from a from a huge business opportunity

77
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:43,080
perspective if you look at the large NGO

78
00:03:40,519 --> 00:03:45,959
and CSO sectors which is very very

79
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:48,400
active in agriculture in uh developing

80
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:51,039
countries they look at it more from a

81
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:54,799
rural development angle because the

82
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:59,158
large number of Rural people whom these

83
00:03:54,799 --> 00:04:01,799
Nos and csos work with um also happen to

84
00:03:59,158 --> 00:04:04,078
be Farm so if if you are doing Health

85
00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:08,319
work in rural area if if if you are

86
00:04:04,079 --> 00:04:11,200
doing uh uh you know social benefit work

87
00:04:08,318 --> 00:04:13,158
in rural area agriculture becomes very

88
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:15,159
important as well and therefore you know

89
00:04:13,158 --> 00:04:17,639
often it is seen from that

90
00:04:15,159 --> 00:04:19,959
angle if you look at from the public

91
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:22,840
sector or the government perspective of

92
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:24,720
that of course policies and and so forth

93
00:04:22,839 --> 00:04:28,399
but let's face this one of the biggest

94
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:31,320
thing is uh you know a large portion of

95
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:33,399
their voters also happen to be people

96
00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:36,560
who are dependent on agriculture so you

97
00:04:33,399 --> 00:04:39,279
know from a political angle also uh you

98
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:41,439
and and and from a food security angle

99
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:44,279
uh this becomes an extremely important

100
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:47,759
proposition if you look at the uh the

101
00:04:44,279 --> 00:04:50,638
elections around the world uh in in last

102
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:55,639
four years which is recent elections in

103
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:59,240
in many countries 57 countries have had

104
00:04:55,639 --> 00:05:00,918
agriculture as their main issue uh of

105
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:03,079
election

106
00:05:00,918 --> 00:05:05,198
and this again is because of the

107
00:05:03,079 --> 00:05:07,079
dependence of a large number of people

108
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:09,280
in these countries on agriculture and

109
00:05:07,079 --> 00:05:11,918
therefore agriculture becomes a major

110
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:15,879
major agenda uh for the for the

111
00:05:11,918 --> 00:05:18,279
political um uh parties as well from an

112
00:05:15,879 --> 00:05:20,759
R&amp;D perspective of course you know there

113
00:05:18,279 --> 00:05:24,239
are lot large number of challenges to be

114
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:26,199
addressed um and and uh especially and

115
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:28,360
I'll talk about that a little more

116
00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:29,919
especially increasing productivity and

117
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:32,680
so forth so there is a there is is a

118
00:05:29,918 --> 00:05:35,000
different angle but if you look at the

119
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:37,879
farmers especially in the developing

120
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:41,279
country Farmers the way they look at

121
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:43,719
Agriculture and and contrary to a lot of

122
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:46,000
the governments even believing you know

123
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:47,400
I I always say Farmers don't Farm

124
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,279
because they are concerned about

125
00:05:47,399 --> 00:05:54,079
country's food security Farmers Farm

126
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:56,119
because they see this as a business and

127
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:59,000
and often a lot of these people

128
00:05:56,120 --> 00:06:03,000
especially CSO public sector and often

129
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:05,160
R&amp;D and angle sort of forgets that angle

130
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,720
that the farmer looks at it for a farmer

131
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:09,439
it is marketable product that they are

132
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:12,759
interested in they are really not

133
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:15,160
interested in in anything else right and

134
00:06:12,759 --> 00:06:17,919
Farmers around the world uh you know

135
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:20,360
grow it as a as an important source of

136
00:06:17,918 --> 00:06:23,399
their livelihood often an only source of

137
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:26,080
their livelihood and and we also know

138
00:06:23,399 --> 00:06:28,918
from a from a large number of studies

139
00:06:26,079 --> 00:06:30,079
that most of the developing country

140
00:06:28,918 --> 00:06:32,439
farmers

141
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:33,918
remain in agriculture because they don't

142
00:06:32,439 --> 00:06:37,279
have any other

143
00:06:33,918 --> 00:06:40,598
option and therefore the efforts that we

144
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:43,399
we do uh in in through any of these

145
00:06:40,598 --> 00:06:45,598
stakeholders we'll have to keep that in

146
00:06:43,399 --> 00:06:45,598
in

147
00:06:47,918 --> 00:06:53,279
mind so I just wanted to and I wanted to

148
00:06:50,918 --> 00:06:55,560
do it more as a discussion point because

149
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:57,559
I know there is a there is a there is a

150
00:06:55,560 --> 00:07:00,038
lot of knowledge in this room as well so

151
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:02,439
I wanted to sort of as much as I can and

152
00:07:00,038 --> 00:07:04,719
open this up and talk about these issues

153
00:07:02,439 --> 00:07:07,598
but uh one of the things I wanted to

154
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:10,319
talk about is taking India as an example

155
00:07:07,598 --> 00:07:12,680
and just taking an overview of uh of

156
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:14,759
Indian agriculture where it stands right

157
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:17,800
now and what are the key challenges from

158
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:21,000
all these different perspectives uh um

159
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:23,598
and um and and then looking at

160
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:26,639
productivity I I I was tempted to bring

161
00:07:23,598 --> 00:07:28,399
this because uh um Sarah told me this is

162
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:30,879
going to be a plant breeding and

163
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:33,878
genetics seminar and therefore I wanted

164
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:36,639
to bring a non-productivity angle to the

165
00:07:33,879 --> 00:07:38,560
to the seminar uh and and to to again

166
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:41,120
talk about more from a client

167
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:43,560
perspective from a farmers's perspective

168
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:46,199
and then I want to you know summing up

169
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:48,120
all these ideas that we've been thinking

170
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:51,520
about we have

171
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:53,639
completely sort of revamped uh our

172
00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:55,839
agriculture investment strategy as Bill

173
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:58,598
and Melinda Gates Foundation uh

174
00:07:55,839 --> 00:08:01,038
especially for India and uh uh we'd like

175
00:07:58,598 --> 00:08:03,478
to talk a little bit about uh about that

176
00:08:01,038 --> 00:08:06,680
and what are our Focus areas and how it

177
00:08:03,478 --> 00:08:09,038
has shifted kind of to respond to uh

178
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:12,918
some of these these big changes that I

179
00:08:09,038 --> 00:08:12,918
will talk about uh throughout the

180
00:08:13,918 --> 00:08:20,680
slides so you know India is about to

181
00:08:17,319 --> 00:08:24,199
become the the the most populated

182
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:26,959
country agriculture continues to to

183
00:08:24,199 --> 00:08:29,680
remain a backbone of India's economy

184
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:32,079
despite of the the large growth where

185
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:35,839
the country has moved to moved at the is

186
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:39,038
moving at the pace of say 7% 7.5%

187
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:42,959
economic growth uh agriculture remains

188
00:08:39,038 --> 00:08:45,080
at about 2.5 2.8 and yet because of the

189
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:48,199
large number of people dependent on

190
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:50,600
agriculture the rural economies of India

191
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:53,200
continues to remain very very dependent

192
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:55,278
on on agriculture and this is this is

193
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,920
not very different from many other

194
00:08:55,278 --> 00:09:00,559
developing countries but India it is it

195
00:08:57,919 --> 00:09:04,078
is it is really unique because if you

196
00:09:00,559 --> 00:09:06,439
look at uh look at generally the history

197
00:09:04,078 --> 00:09:09,639
as as the country

198
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:11,360
progresses the farm sizes have increased

199
00:09:09,639 --> 00:09:14,120
in many many countries around the world

200
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:16,480
we have seen it in India for some reason

201
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:20,480
we are not seeing that phenomenal in

202
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:23,560
last 40 years the the farm size or the

203
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:28,079
land holding has actually halfed from

204
00:09:23,559 --> 00:09:32,039
2.3 to about 1.2 now so it is it is

205
00:09:28,078 --> 00:09:34,958
going to continue for quite some time uh

206
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:37,958
as as an low input low output

207
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:40,518
agriculture system but the numbers that

208
00:09:37,958 --> 00:09:43,479
it has you know 1/4th of the of the

209
00:09:40,519 --> 00:09:46,320
world's farming population uh lives in

210
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:48,399
India so so if if you say every every

211
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:51,720
fourth Farmer in the world is an Indian

212
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:54,639
farmer so a large number of uh farming

213
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:57,959
population large number of PE people

214
00:09:54,639 --> 00:10:00,159
dependent on agriculture um as as an

215
00:09:57,958 --> 00:10:02,559
important or only so

216
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:05,519
uh of their livelihood is is what is

217
00:10:02,559 --> 00:10:07,799
making uh making it unique the other

218
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:09,360
unique feature about India and that's

219
00:10:07,799 --> 00:10:11,759
again something that we will have to

220
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:14,200
remember while while designing our

221
00:10:11,759 --> 00:10:17,838
research programs or while designing our

222
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:23,000
policies is the prevailance of mixed

223
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:25,959
farming system there is no such thing as

224
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:28,639
crop farmer or livestock farmer in a

225
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:29,838
country like India it is all mixed

226
00:10:28,639 --> 00:10:32,480
farming

227
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:34,959
farmers do it mainly as their mitigation

228
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:38,320
risk mitigation strategy but if you look

229
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:40,319
at a typical average Indian farm and and

230
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:42,519
you know this is something I constantly

231
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,959
remind my colleagues uh at the

232
00:10:42,519 --> 00:10:47,720
foundation also that you know anything

233
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:49,879
we say about India you know the the the

234
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:52,079
opposite view also could be true so it's

235
00:10:49,879 --> 00:10:55,360
is very difficult to generalize anything

236
00:10:52,078 --> 00:10:58,359
about this country however generally

237
00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:00,919
speaking on an average it is all mixed

238
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:01,680
farming system where there is typically

239
00:11:00,919 --> 00:11:05,599
a

240
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:07,958
1.2 hectares of land and one livestock

241
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:10,560
it is it could be a cow it could be a

242
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:14,319
buffalo or it could be um the the

243
00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:16,479
average is 2.2 goats so this is this is

244
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:18,278
the kind of mixed farming and therefore

245
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:20,879
when you look at it from a farmer's

246
00:11:18,278 --> 00:11:23,320
perspective the farmer is not looking

247
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:25,519
for a crop solution or a livestock

248
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:28,079
solution the farmer is looking for a

249
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:31,078
combined solution and a large number of

250
00:11:28,078 --> 00:11:34,239
our R&amp;D efforts a large number of our

251
00:11:31,078 --> 00:11:36,120
policy effort kind of Misses out on that

252
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:38,519
that vantage point and I I'll talk a

253
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:43,159
little bit more about that uh little a

254
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:46,078
little bit um the GDP growth so it's

255
00:11:43,159 --> 00:11:48,399
it's very interesting that as I said the

256
00:11:46,078 --> 00:11:51,638
the country's agriculture is growing at

257
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:53,879
at the rate of about 2.5 2.8% the

258
00:11:51,639 --> 00:11:57,240
country's generally economic growth is

259
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:59,360
at has crossed about 7% and and

260
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:02,000
therefore the demand for food is increas

261
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:04,600
increasing uh and and and with the

262
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:07,360
demand and with the income the kind of

263
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:09,639
food people are asking for the diversity

264
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:12,800
is increasing let me take you take an

265
00:12:09,639 --> 00:12:16,159
example of livestock for example for

266
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:19,399
over the years India itself India's

267
00:12:16,159 --> 00:12:21,278
policymaking itself and India's and and

268
00:12:19,399 --> 00:12:24,440
the international perception about the

269
00:12:21,278 --> 00:12:26,278
country was that this is predominantly a

270
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:29,399
vegetarian country and that's why the

271
00:12:26,278 --> 00:12:32,480
livestock sector is not growing the the

272
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:35,120
income levels changing has completely

273
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:37,320
proven us wrong in that perception the

274
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:40,399
livestock sector growth for example in

275
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:42,600
the country is is has doubled than uh

276
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:45,559
than the general agriculture growth and

277
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:48,480
the demand for meat in the country has

278
00:12:45,559 --> 00:12:51,319
increased at the rate of 8 to 12% in

279
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:55,839
last last uh uh Last 5 Years depending

280
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:57,600
upon which state so people were not

281
00:12:55,839 --> 00:13:00,959
predominantly

282
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:03,720
vegetarian because of of any religious

283
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:06,278
biases larger number of people were

284
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:09,120
vegetarian because they could not afford

285
00:13:06,278 --> 00:13:12,759
non-vegetarian food so now with those

286
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:15,519
income level rising there is a big uh

287
00:13:12,759 --> 00:13:18,319
demand in in in that also and and the

288
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:21,959
demand went up up to a level where for

289
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:25,240
example since last three years now India

290
00:13:21,958 --> 00:13:28,958
became the world's largest exporter of

291
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:31,159
meat for a contrary to the belief that

292
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:35,599
this is a vegetarian country you know

293
00:13:31,159 --> 00:13:39,919
that entire thing has has shifted as

294
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:42,519
well um very little land the last Point

295
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:45,399
very little land very little agriculture

296
00:13:42,519 --> 00:13:48,519
resources like water but a large

297
00:13:45,399 --> 00:13:51,360
population which is growing and uh also

298
00:13:48,519 --> 00:13:54,240
a very large number of world's 15%

299
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:56,639
livestock that uh that little land and

300
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,879
that water has to support so these are

301
00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:00,639
these these are some of the

302
00:13:57,879 --> 00:14:04,600
opportunities and some of the challenges

303
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:07,639
that one has to work with

304
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:09,839
uh so as you can see the dependence on

305
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:12,079
agriculture in the country you know if

306
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:14,399
if you look at compare it with China for

307
00:14:12,078 --> 00:14:17,719
example the dependence on agriculture

308
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:20,958
has been reducing however in India that

309
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:24,079
is that has not made a a a major major

310
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:26,198
change it is slowly decreasing but still

311
00:14:24,078 --> 00:14:28,319
extremely important where more than half

312
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:31,039
of the country's population depends on

313
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,040
agriculture

314
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:36,360
if you compare it say for example with

315
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:39,000
with some of these countries you can see

316
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:41,560
why from a policy perspective from a

317
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:44,440
politicians perspective from a uh

318
00:14:41,559 --> 00:14:47,638
private sector angle from all these NGO

319
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:49,680
CSO why would agriculture mean so much

320
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:51,799
not just because of Agriculture as

321
00:14:49,679 --> 00:14:54,599
farming but because of the people who

322
00:14:51,799 --> 00:14:54,599
are dependent on

323
00:14:55,720 --> 00:15:00,639
agriculture so over the years you know

324
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:04,240
given given all these population

325
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:07,039
challenges and all that also the country

326
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:09,278
has really come a long way in becoming

327
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:12,639
one of the one of the top agriculture

328
00:15:09,278 --> 00:15:16,120
producers of the world it is it is it's

329
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:19,519
remarkable where where it has come uh in

330
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:21,879
terms of its um its U you know rice and

331
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:23,959
wheat and vegetables and pulses and all

332
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:26,600
these production so that there has been

333
00:15:23,958 --> 00:15:29,359
a remarkable progress

334
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:31,240
however uh I am reminded as especially

335
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:34,278
because I'm I'm standing in a plant

336
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:37,159
breeding and genetics department that

337
00:15:34,278 --> 00:15:40,318
all these these large numbers and all

338
00:15:37,159 --> 00:15:43,639
this growth predominantly comes from the

339
00:15:40,318 --> 00:15:45,759
large number of people it does not come

340
00:15:43,639 --> 00:15:48,198
from productivity efficiency

341
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:51,000
productivity Still Remains at one of the

342
00:15:48,198 --> 00:15:53,919
lowest in the world in in India so it is

343
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:56,198
it is just this this large numbers that

344
00:15:53,919 --> 00:15:59,318
is driving this production and the

345
00:15:56,198 --> 00:16:02,559
growth so while I would say that the

346
00:15:59,318 --> 00:16:05,240
production um of India the output is

347
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:08,159
very very high I would not call the

348
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:12,519
Indian agriculture system as as an

349
00:16:08,159 --> 00:16:12,519
effective or sustainable Center um

350
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:19,920
system so I just wanted to take uh you

351
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:23,000
know two major areas where uh uh what

352
00:16:19,919 --> 00:16:24,719
what has driven mainly those big data

353
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:28,559
that you saw and what has brought the

354
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:30,920
country uh from uh uh to to a level of

355
00:16:28,559 --> 00:16:33,439
being one of the leaders in agriculture

356
00:16:30,919 --> 00:16:37,799
production but at the same time I also

357
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:39,480
wanted to visit two factors that has

358
00:16:37,799 --> 00:16:41,318
that has been a challenge as well for

359
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:43,560
the country and which which we which we

360
00:16:41,318 --> 00:16:45,919
continue to face and I I especially

361
00:16:43,559 --> 00:16:48,399
wanted to bring it because you know a

362
00:16:45,919 --> 00:16:50,799
lot of the uh lot of lot of other

363
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:53,799
countries especially countries in East

364
00:16:50,799 --> 00:16:55,719
Africa and so forth are trying to take

365
00:16:53,799 --> 00:16:59,120
these paths and there are a large number

366
00:16:55,720 --> 00:17:01,600
of lessons uh that are hidden from the

367
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:05,199
from the India

368
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:08,759
story so Green Revolution in India uh as

369
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:11,839
we know from uh from 60s to '90s this

370
00:17:08,759 --> 00:17:15,240
was really truly a revolutionary thing

371
00:17:11,838 --> 00:17:17,958
where the countryes uh um you know uh

372
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:21,359
the wheat and rice production went up by

373
00:17:17,959 --> 00:17:24,199
30% it was it was really a remarkable

374
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:28,639
progress in terms of the food production

375
00:17:24,199 --> 00:17:31,360
so um you know in in 50s uh from being

376
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:34,000
uh you know we they used to call it ship

377
00:17:31,359 --> 00:17:38,359
to mouth country where the country was

378
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:40,880
dependent on agriculture import uh the

379
00:17:38,359 --> 00:17:43,479
there was this this was one huge policy

380
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:46,320
change the Green Revolution that brought

381
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:49,279
the country to a to a food exporting

382
00:17:46,319 --> 00:17:53,240
state so it it was a remarkable progress

383
00:17:49,279 --> 00:17:55,720
it it it and it was mainly um you know

384
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:57,839
through large number of Technology

385
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:59,360
adoption it was especially the seed

386
00:17:57,839 --> 00:18:03,798
technology adoption

387
00:17:59,359 --> 00:18:06,639
and added with a large extension uh um

388
00:18:03,798 --> 00:18:10,918
efforts uh but but a very very public

389
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:14,120
dominated government uh dominated

390
00:18:10,919 --> 00:18:16,400
Revolution that uh that brought about

391
00:18:14,119 --> 00:18:19,558
that huge change that you you see that

392
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,559
that steep curve in the

393
00:18:19,839 --> 00:18:26,639
graph then came the da Revolution which

394
00:18:23,079 --> 00:18:30,439
was about 40 years ago now where uh

395
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:33,080
where um India became the largest

396
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:35,640
producer of milk in the world and this

397
00:18:33,079 --> 00:18:38,079
was again a revolutionary thing in the

398
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:41,000
livestock sector but only in the cattle

399
00:18:38,079 --> 00:18:43,319
sector in the in the dairy uh sector

400
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:46,558
which again was very very remarkable and

401
00:18:43,319 --> 00:18:48,879
it had a significant impact also on the

402
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:53,798
consumption pattern where people were

403
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:57,600
getting only about 111 GS per day in 74

404
00:18:53,798 --> 00:19:00,079
that went uh uh more than double uh by

405
00:18:57,599 --> 00:19:02,879
by 2011 so it was a huge and despite of

406
00:19:00,079 --> 00:19:05,558
the population growth so so the second

407
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:07,600
one was the was the white Revolution

408
00:19:05,558 --> 00:19:09,759
that brought about some of those numbers

409
00:19:07,599 --> 00:19:09,759
as

410
00:19:10,839 --> 00:19:18,199
well but again in both these re

411
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:20,919
revolutions the focus was the um you

412
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:23,319
know production by masses rather than

413
00:19:20,919 --> 00:19:26,919
mass production and that was the major

414
00:19:23,319 --> 00:19:28,720
difference between an industrial country

415
00:19:26,919 --> 00:19:30,960
uh you know bringing in their produ

416
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:33,079
production level high and and and this

417
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:36,000
kind of a country well bringing in a

418
00:19:33,079 --> 00:19:39,038
production High productivity continues

419
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,919
to remain a major challenge uh and it's

420
00:19:39,038 --> 00:19:43,400
it's just the numbers that is driving

421
00:19:40,919 --> 00:19:43,400
the whole

422
00:19:43,798 --> 00:19:50,240
thing so if you if we if we look at the

423
00:19:47,038 --> 00:19:52,359
comparison between Green Revolution and

424
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:55,359
white Revolution and I want to open this

425
00:19:52,359 --> 00:19:57,158
up uh um at this point also and I just

426
00:19:55,359 --> 00:20:00,279
wanted to bring a few pointers and

427
00:19:57,159 --> 00:20:03,120
wanted to have some uh some some

428
00:20:00,279 --> 00:20:05,839
brainstorming with uh with you guys

429
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:08,558
because I know some of you um know these

430
00:20:05,839 --> 00:20:11,119
stories very very well um and I just

431
00:20:08,558 --> 00:20:13,440
wanted to open up to to talk about a

432
00:20:11,119 --> 00:20:16,119
little more and is to comparing some of

433
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:18,720
these these revolutions but if you look

434
00:20:16,119 --> 00:20:21,558
at the Green Revolution it was public

435
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:23,798
sector driven whereas if you look at the

436
00:20:21,558 --> 00:20:26,000
white Revolution it was farmer

437
00:20:23,798 --> 00:20:28,279
Cooperative driven it was it was

438
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,640
basically a people's moment the white

439
00:20:28,279 --> 00:20:32,720
revolu tion uh the the government of

440
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:35,000
course was very very involved but it

441
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:39,360
wasn't dominated by the policies or it

442
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:41,519
wasn't the government driven um thing

443
00:20:39,359 --> 00:20:45,759
I'm just coming from from Sarah's

444
00:20:41,519 --> 00:20:47,839
program on on the alliance for sciences

445
00:20:45,759 --> 00:20:50,440
and I was thinking about the third one

446
00:20:47,839 --> 00:20:52,439
which came up which was the cotton

447
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:55,480
growth story and some people in India

448
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:58,159
like to call it as the gene Revolution

449
00:20:55,480 --> 00:21:00,279
uh and uh if if you look at the if if

450
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:03,240
you look at that as a revolution if you

451
00:21:00,279 --> 00:21:05,839
look at the the uh prevalence of

452
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:07,279
transgenic cotton in in in a country

453
00:21:05,839 --> 00:21:08,558
like India and if you want to call it

454
00:21:07,279 --> 00:21:11,200
like a gene

455
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:12,960
Revolution that was predominantly

456
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:15,558
private sector driven so it's so

457
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:18,600
interesting in the same kind of country

458
00:21:15,558 --> 00:21:20,558
in the same kind of a format um how

459
00:21:18,599 --> 00:21:23,480
different revolutions had different

460
00:21:20,558 --> 00:21:25,639
impacts at different levels and how all

461
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:29,159
three were completely a different

462
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:32,400
approach uh a public sector LED um a

463
00:21:29,159 --> 00:21:35,720
farmer Leed a people moment Cooperative

464
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:37,200
lead and a completely private sector Le

465
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:40,480
uh

466
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:43,400
Revolution the Green Revolution was very

467
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:46,519
production Centric right it was it was

468
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:49,000
only about you know increasing the

469
00:21:46,519 --> 00:21:51,119
production come what may whatever it

470
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:54,038
takes let's just increase the production

471
00:21:51,119 --> 00:21:56,439
of the country to be able to uh you know

472
00:21:54,038 --> 00:21:58,038
come out of that uh that import

473
00:21:56,440 --> 00:22:00,400
dependence so it was very very

474
00:21:58,038 --> 00:22:03,200
production Centric if you look at the

475
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:06,640
milk Revolution or the white Revolution

476
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:09,720
it was Market Centric the the entire

477
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:12,320
Focus was on not on production the

478
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:15,159
entire Focus was on Market development

479
00:22:12,319 --> 00:22:18,439
you know let's give all these large

480
00:22:15,159 --> 00:22:21,799
number of men and women especially women

481
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:23,880
a market base let let us let us create

482
00:22:21,798 --> 00:22:25,839
that market base where they can they can

483
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:28,039
aggregate their milk and they can sell

484
00:22:25,839 --> 00:22:30,359
their milk and create that market base

485
00:22:28,038 --> 00:22:33,000
everything else production Animal Health

486
00:22:30,359 --> 00:22:37,519
all those things will will follow and so

487
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:39,599
it was a very Market Centric uh program

488
00:22:37,519 --> 00:22:41,519
when when I say production Centric in

489
00:22:39,599 --> 00:22:43,918
Green Revolution Market of course is

490
00:22:41,519 --> 00:22:48,558
important but the

491
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:50,840
buyer in those days and buyer even now

492
00:22:48,558 --> 00:22:53,079
Remains the government which is the

493
00:22:50,839 --> 00:22:55,158
predominant buyer of the Green

494
00:22:53,079 --> 00:22:57,158
Revolution products from the farmer so

495
00:22:55,159 --> 00:23:00,000
the farmer did not have to worry about

496
00:22:57,159 --> 00:23:03,360
Market it was only the production aspect

497
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:06,000
whereas here it was Market aspect both

498
00:23:03,359 --> 00:23:09,519
focused on limited number of

499
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:12,720
Commodities you know none of our green

500
00:23:09,519 --> 00:23:15,480
none of our revolutions has been multic

501
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:18,440
commodity uh revolutions Green

502
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:21,599
Revolution focused only on two Comm

503
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:24,759
Commodities mainly rice and wheat milk

504
00:23:21,599 --> 00:23:28,599
revolution of course focused only on

505
00:23:24,759 --> 00:23:32,558
milk um and both interestingly in a

506
00:23:28,599 --> 00:23:37,839
large country like India focused on on a

507
00:23:32,558 --> 00:23:40,759
very very set small uh area of geography

508
00:23:37,839 --> 00:23:43,079
the Green Revolution focused only in

509
00:23:40,759 --> 00:23:45,759
three or four states in the northern

510
00:23:43,079 --> 00:23:48,599
part of India it did not worry about

511
00:23:45,759 --> 00:23:51,158
anything else uh the white Revolution

512
00:23:48,599 --> 00:23:53,319
focused only on two or three states in

513
00:23:51,159 --> 00:23:56,320
the western part of India and did not

514
00:23:53,319 --> 00:23:58,879
worry about anything else so this were

515
00:23:56,319 --> 00:24:02,558
the these were the two two very very

516
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:06,080
Dynamic but uh you know two revolutions

517
00:24:02,558 --> 00:24:08,839
same country completely different uh

518
00:24:06,079 --> 00:24:13,558
approaches I can stop here for a while

519
00:24:08,839 --> 00:24:13,558
and and get some get some discussion

520
00:24:14,599 --> 00:24:17,599
here

521
00:24:24,679 --> 00:24:31,159
yeah so the so the white Revolution as I

522
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:34,000
said was a very grassroot level uh level

523
00:24:31,159 --> 00:24:36,760
program right uh whereas the Green

524
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:40,038
Revolution I have a fascinating story

525
00:24:36,759 --> 00:24:42,519
that my my professor who uh who who used

526
00:24:40,038 --> 00:24:44,558
to be very associated with Cornell also

527
00:24:42,519 --> 00:24:46,679
uh Ms Swami Natan who worked with Norman

528
00:24:44,558 --> 00:24:50,319
borlock to bring the Green Revolution to

529
00:24:46,679 --> 00:24:53,919
India and um Dr swamin Natan um tells a

530
00:24:50,319 --> 00:24:56,439
very fantastic story where he says uh

531
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:59,278
the then prime minister of India Indira

532
00:24:56,440 --> 00:25:01,880
Gandhi had come to a trip to the US and

533
00:24:59,278 --> 00:25:04,558
had some meetings in Washington DC

534
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:08,200
asking uh the US government who was the

535
00:25:04,558 --> 00:25:10,879
main supplier of uh of wheat to India in

536
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:14,798
those days to reduce the price further

537
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:16,600
of what they are sending to India and

538
00:25:14,798 --> 00:25:20,918
whatever happened in that diplomatic

539
00:25:16,599 --> 00:25:24,719
meeting she Mrs Gandhi came back to uh

540
00:25:20,919 --> 00:25:26,799
to India at 6:00 in the morning and 8:30

541
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:29,240
she called a meeting of her agriculture

542
00:25:26,798 --> 00:25:32,158
Minister and a few people and said said

543
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:33,880
whatever is it takes I don't care for

544
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:35,960
anything else I don't care for

545
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:38,960
sustainability I don't care how many

546
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:41,240
people you need um I want the food

547
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:43,759
production in this country to go up and

548
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:47,480
I'm giving you 10 years for that and

549
00:25:43,759 --> 00:25:49,919
this this is a story so an extremely

550
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:51,919
strong political will I think was was

551
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:54,919
under that but at the same time an

552
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:57,559
extreme need it was almost like a crisis

553
00:25:54,919 --> 00:26:00,360
situation uh that that brought it there

554
00:25:57,558 --> 00:26:03,398
and in the history his of India uh this

555
00:26:00,359 --> 00:26:05,558
is the first time the agriculture

556
00:26:03,398 --> 00:26:07,239
scientist of the country the top

557
00:26:05,558 --> 00:26:10,960
agriculture scientists of the country

558
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:13,480
were reporting directly to the Prime

559
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:18,120
Minister that's the kind of I think

560
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:20,480
political will it it it

561
00:26:18,119 --> 00:26:24,558
required but you are you're most welcome

562
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:27,278
to add to this and not just just ask so

563
00:26:24,558 --> 00:26:30,960
a question on the white Revolution why

564
00:26:27,278 --> 00:26:33,839
is milk uh Revolution so limited in

565
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:37,360
number of pro does those areas have

566
00:26:33,839 --> 00:26:39,240
enough range or why is it no that's

567
00:26:37,359 --> 00:26:41,798
that's exactly and that's that's what I

568
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:44,200
wanted to talk about uh when I say what

569
00:26:41,798 --> 00:26:46,480
did not work and I think that is that

570
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:48,840
has been one of the biggest challenges

571
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:50,839
it has uh you know we've P paid a price

572
00:26:48,839 --> 00:26:54,158
for these revolutions also and I wanted

573
00:26:50,839 --> 00:26:56,639
to wanted to briefly talk about uh that

574
00:26:54,159 --> 00:27:00,240
also in the in the next V so thanks for

575
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:00,240
raising the yeah

576
00:27:14,798 --> 00:27:19,359
right so the meat Revolution again is uh

577
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:22,120
is is just because of the large number

578
00:27:19,359 --> 00:27:25,158
of cattles that uh that are sort of

579
00:27:22,119 --> 00:27:27,599
addressing the uh the milk need and and

580
00:27:25,159 --> 00:27:29,559
that's how it it came in there is very

581
00:27:27,599 --> 00:27:31,599
little government involvement really in

582
00:27:29,558 --> 00:27:34,359
that export Market it is it is all

583
00:27:31,599 --> 00:27:36,319
generally there are several perceptions

584
00:27:34,359 --> 00:27:39,240
now with with some of those religious

585
00:27:36,319 --> 00:27:41,639
biases of whether or not we can export

586
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:43,558
beef or not or whether or whether or not

587
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:45,840
we can actually kill a cow or not but

588
00:27:43,558 --> 00:27:50,200
that's a different thing India it's very

589
00:27:45,839 --> 00:27:53,278
interesting because uh uh you know at

590
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:56,880
least 58% of our milk comes from

591
00:27:53,278 --> 00:28:00,640
Buffalos and not cows so a large amount

592
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:05,799
of uh buff meat that you see getting

593
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:07,799
exported is predominantly Buffalo's

594
00:28:05,798 --> 00:28:11,839
so

595
00:28:07,798 --> 00:28:14,839
yeah I come from

596
00:28:11,839 --> 00:28:14,839
afri

597
00:28:21,519 --> 00:28:29,359
IND

598
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:29,360
not account for the fact that

599
00:28:35,759 --> 00:28:41,440
yeah that's that's one of the things and

600
00:28:37,599 --> 00:28:45,119
also uh as I said you know Buffalo is a

601
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:49,038
is a very big part of the dairy uh

602
00:28:45,119 --> 00:28:49,038
sector so it is it is

603
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:58,240
both but any because I know uh there has

604
00:28:54,919 --> 00:29:01,960
been several groups at Cornell historic

605
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:06,120
Ally uh also uh involved in in in some

606
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:08,558
of these uh India's uh revolutions

607
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:10,599
anything you would like to add um would

608
00:29:08,558 --> 00:29:13,240
be would be great as

609
00:29:10,599 --> 00:29:15,398
well yeah just a simple question what

610
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:18,960
was fostering this growth for both

611
00:29:15,398 --> 00:29:22,038
revolutions was it sector involvement

612
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:24,720
International cooperatives

613
00:29:22,038 --> 00:29:26,679
Partnerships so it was public sector

614
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:29,079
involvement in Green Revolution as I

615
00:29:26,679 --> 00:29:31,440
said and farmer cooperative moment you

616
00:29:29,079 --> 00:29:34,079
know Farmers themselves aggregating

617
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:36,159
together and and doing this uh and and

618
00:29:34,079 --> 00:29:40,879
making it world's largest farmer

619
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:43,519
Cooperative moment uh was was behind the

620
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:45,240
uh behind the white Revolution but there

621
00:29:43,519 --> 00:29:47,440
was a lot of international the

622
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:50,679
technology played an extremely important

623
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:53,200
role also Green Revolution for example

624
00:29:50,679 --> 00:29:55,559
now it's interesting because white

625
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:57,720
Revolution was as I said was not

626
00:29:55,558 --> 00:30:01,079
production driven it was Market driven

627
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:04,440
so there were limited technology um you

628
00:30:01,079 --> 00:30:06,480
know facets as it began later on of

629
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:08,278
course as the farmers saw more value to

630
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:10,120
their markets they had more money to

631
00:30:08,278 --> 00:30:12,159
spend on their cattle then the

632
00:30:10,119 --> 00:30:13,839
vaccination started then the animal

633
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:16,360
health investment started and that was a

634
00:30:13,839 --> 00:30:19,720
different story but but the Genesis of

635
00:30:16,359 --> 00:30:24,199
it but in in case of Green Revolution

636
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:27,159
the um the ir8 rice variety for example

637
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:30,880
the we the draft wheat variety all those

638
00:30:27,159 --> 00:30:33,200
Technologies actually uh came um with

639
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:35,039
the with the support of Ford foundation

640
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:37,558
and Rockefeller foundation and it was

641
00:30:35,038 --> 00:30:39,599
Norman borlock who who kind of brought

642
00:30:37,558 --> 00:30:42,359
those so that was very very technology

643
00:30:39,599 --> 00:30:45,158
oriented and with absolute uh

644
00:30:42,359 --> 00:30:48,519
international support as as far as the

645
00:30:45,159 --> 00:30:48,519
technology is is

646
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:56,679
concerned so I just wanted to briefly

647
00:30:54,079 --> 00:30:58,798
bring in and and sort of revisit both

648
00:30:56,679 --> 00:31:01,840
these Revolution and and and then

649
00:30:58,798 --> 00:31:05,079
connected to some of India's modern day

650
00:31:01,839 --> 00:31:08,000
agriculture problems and and perhaps uh

651
00:31:05,079 --> 00:31:11,359
if if with a threat of sounding uh you

652
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,919
know too abrupt uh connecting them with

653
00:31:11,359 --> 00:31:16,599
some of the limitations that these

654
00:31:12,919 --> 00:31:16,600
revolutions brought to the

655
00:31:17,038 --> 00:31:21,960
country to your

656
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:25,038
question Green

657
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:27,960
Revolution had a very very isolated

658
00:31:25,038 --> 00:31:30,440
impact it had huge impact on those

659
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:32,480
isolated areas and therefore the country

660
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:35,519
got a big win in increasing its

661
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:38,399
production and so forth but it it in

662
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:41,079
those days it it started in isolation

663
00:31:38,398 --> 00:31:44,439
and to date today even after all these

664
00:31:41,079 --> 00:31:48,519
years also we have not been successful

665
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:50,639
in bringing those revolutionary

666
00:31:48,519 --> 00:31:53,759
Productions both in case of Green

667
00:31:50,638 --> 00:31:57,359
Revolution and in white Revolution to

668
00:31:53,759 --> 00:31:59,839
other parts of India which actually um

669
00:31:57,359 --> 00:32:03,000
you know need needs it much more

670
00:31:59,839 --> 00:32:07,000
now and and so if you can see and it had

671
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:09,200
impact on everything if you see the the

672
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:11,319
uh the agriculture technology adoption

673
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:13,639
rate if you look at the productivity

674
00:32:11,319 --> 00:32:15,480
angle so I don't want to deny that

675
00:32:13,638 --> 00:32:18,240
productivity is not a challenge it

676
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:20,839
absolutely is a challenge and especially

677
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:23,120
in the coexistence of different system

678
00:32:20,839 --> 00:32:25,759
in a country like India where there are

679
00:32:23,119 --> 00:32:28,278
different trajectories uh there is an

680
00:32:25,759 --> 00:32:31,440
there is a very very high input high

681
00:32:28,278 --> 00:32:33,638
output agriculture in the country also

682
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:36,120
but predominantly the country remains

683
00:32:33,638 --> 00:32:38,199
very low input low output type

684
00:32:36,119 --> 00:32:40,759
Agriculture and there are major

685
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:42,558
differences in productivity within the

686
00:32:40,759 --> 00:32:45,558
state

687
00:32:42,558 --> 00:32:48,398
also so the same rice variety for

688
00:32:45,558 --> 00:32:51,678
example the uh the the one of the the

689
00:32:48,398 --> 00:32:54,239
most popular one uh uh the PSA Variety

690
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:59,038
in Punjab which was a Green Revolution

691
00:32:54,240 --> 00:33:02,599
state would uh would would be about 6 .8

692
00:32:59,038 --> 00:33:06,038
uh tons per hectare the same PSA variety

693
00:33:02,599 --> 00:33:09,119
the same rice in in a place in Bihar for

694
00:33:06,038 --> 00:33:12,359
example would hardly bring in a bring in

695
00:33:09,119 --> 00:33:14,759
a productivity of about 2.3 So within

696
00:33:12,359 --> 00:33:17,519
the country there are huge disparities

697
00:33:14,759 --> 00:33:20,240
in terms of productivity in the in the

698
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:23,919
same kind of agroclimatic regions or

699
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:23,919
with the same kind of varieties as

700
00:33:24,278 --> 00:33:28,278
well and and Green Revolution so

701
00:33:27,079 --> 00:33:30,119
interestingly

702
00:33:28,278 --> 00:33:32,440
and and and that's why uh you know we

703
00:33:30,119 --> 00:33:35,199
often call Green Revolution as grain

704
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:37,399
Revolution because it focused only on

705
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:39,798
two crops which was very important for

706
00:33:37,398 --> 00:33:41,239
food security but it focused only on

707
00:33:39,798 --> 00:33:44,759
rice and

708
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:49,278
wheat agriculture diversity a large

709
00:33:44,759 --> 00:33:53,398
number of other crops have really paid a

710
00:33:49,278 --> 00:33:57,398
price if you look at the third most

711
00:33:53,398 --> 00:34:01,119
important which is pulses has has really

712
00:33:57,398 --> 00:34:03,918
really suffered this is again um a sort

713
00:34:01,119 --> 00:34:07,479
of paradox where India is the world's

714
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:10,440
largest producer of pulses India is the

715
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:13,079
world's largest consumer of pulses and

716
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:16,480
India is also world's largest importer

717
00:34:13,079 --> 00:34:18,919
of pulses right now we are almost in

718
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:21,320
that kind of a in in case of pulses we

719
00:34:18,918 --> 00:34:26,598
are almost in that kind of a preg Green

720
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:29,599
Revolution era because as you will see a

721
00:34:26,599 --> 00:34:33,639
large number of the country's efforts up

722
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:38,440
to about 82 83% of the country's efforts

723
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:40,399
now go only on two crops rice and wheat

724
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:44,000
this is to sort of you know keep the

725
00:34:40,398 --> 00:34:47,519
Revolution going uh you know keep the

726
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:50,878
hard earned food security moving and

727
00:34:47,519 --> 00:34:52,878
also because of the large um subsidies

728
00:34:50,878 --> 00:34:55,319
that the government offer to the farmers

729
00:34:52,878 --> 00:34:58,199
to to be able to grow rice and wheat and

730
00:34:55,320 --> 00:35:00,880
the large procurement program that the

731
00:34:58,199 --> 00:35:02,879
government had to buy from the farmers

732
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:05,240
and and once you make a political

733
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:08,160
promise it is very difficult to withdraw

734
00:35:05,239 --> 00:35:10,838
from that so so about 80% of the

735
00:35:08,159 --> 00:35:13,559
country's spending on agriculture is

736
00:35:10,838 --> 00:35:16,440
actually going towards only two crops

737
00:35:13,559 --> 00:35:19,199
and and therefore a lot of the other

738
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:22,599
crops are really suffering and one of

739
00:35:19,199 --> 00:35:25,838
the biggest implication of that is India

740
00:35:22,599 --> 00:35:27,720
has become food secure but nutrition

741
00:35:25,838 --> 00:35:30,119
remains one of the biggest challenge of

742
00:35:27,719 --> 00:35:33,118
of the country so on one hand we are

743
00:35:30,119 --> 00:35:35,960
talking about uh India being you know

744
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:38,400
one of the top most one of the top seven

745
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:41,358
AGR producers of the world if you look

746
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:43,400
at the malnutrition level uh it hosts

747
00:35:41,358 --> 00:35:45,759
the world's largest number of Mal

748
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:49,119
nutrient people as well so that

749
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:54,240
imbalance came from from extreme

750
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:54,240
Revolution uh in in sorting out one

751
00:35:55,920 --> 00:36:00,519
problem so

752
00:35:58,318 --> 00:36:03,838
I jumped the gun a bit didn't know this

753
00:36:00,519 --> 00:36:06,239
SL were coming um so as you can see

754
00:36:03,838 --> 00:36:09,199
malnutrition continues to remain a

755
00:36:06,239 --> 00:36:12,358
challenge in a in India and a lot of

756
00:36:09,199 --> 00:36:15,639
this is also uh you know due to those

757
00:36:12,358 --> 00:36:18,598
kind of Serial based system

758
00:36:15,639 --> 00:36:22,838
interestingly if we if you look at in in

759
00:36:18,599 --> 00:36:25,480
terms of crops there has been three

760
00:36:22,838 --> 00:36:28,400
major policy pivots in the country so

761
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:30,800
far in the history of independent India

762
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:34,200
the first was the Green

763
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:37,000
Revolution the second was the FCI which

764
00:36:34,199 --> 00:36:39,118
is the food uh Food Corporation of India

765
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:41,880
where the government was promising

766
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:43,680
procuring and buying from the farmers uh

767
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:45,519
the government would set up prices and

768
00:36:43,679 --> 00:36:47,159
buy from the farmers because they saw

769
00:36:45,519 --> 00:36:48,800
that the market was the biggest

770
00:36:47,159 --> 00:36:50,559
challenge for the farmer and they

771
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:54,079
started procuring from the from the

772
00:36:50,559 --> 00:36:57,358
farmer and the third more recent one was

773
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:58,079
the food bill of India where the country

774
00:36:57,358 --> 00:37:01,119
uh

775
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:04,000
committed something like $3 billion doll

776
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:07,480
a year and said we are

777
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:11,519
promising uh almost free extremely

778
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:14,240
subsidized food to at least 60% of the

779
00:37:11,519 --> 00:37:17,280
country which was a very very ambitious

780
00:37:14,239 --> 00:37:20,279
plan it became the world's largest uh

781
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:23,240
public distribution system plan so the

782
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:26,720
three the Green Revolution the FCI and

783
00:37:23,239 --> 00:37:29,279
the food bill of India all three major

784
00:37:26,719 --> 00:37:31,239
reforms of of the of agriculture in

785
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:34,680
India have

786
00:37:31,239 --> 00:37:36,078
focused predominantly only on two crops

787
00:37:34,679 --> 00:37:39,559
rice and

788
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:42,079
wheat and we know that none of that has

789
00:37:39,559 --> 00:37:44,799
really contributed to the malnutrition

790
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:44,800
challenge of the

791
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:52,119
country so interestingly if we look at

792
00:37:49,719 --> 00:37:54,118
you know again as I said you know in a

793
00:37:52,119 --> 00:37:58,240
diverse country like India where they

794
00:37:54,119 --> 00:38:00,720
where there are such large number of of

795
00:37:58,239 --> 00:38:03,919
wealth quantiles it is very difficult to

796
00:38:00,719 --> 00:38:06,239
generalize that you know so and so um

797
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:08,559
village is more Mal nutrient so and so

798
00:38:06,239 --> 00:38:10,919
is not this quantile of health wealth

799
00:38:08,559 --> 00:38:14,719
people are less Mal nutrient and not but

800
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:17,480
if you look at the this this light brown

801
00:38:14,719 --> 00:38:19,799
bar it it kind of has a difference

802
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:22,599
between the top quantile which means the

803
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:24,640
wealthiest people of India and the fifth

804
00:38:22,599 --> 00:38:27,599
being the the lowest which is the

805
00:38:24,639 --> 00:38:30,000
poorest of the poor of of the country if

806
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:32,559
you look at the serial

807
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:37,519
consumption it is

808
00:38:32,559 --> 00:38:39,400
almost constant across the entire

809
00:38:37,519 --> 00:38:44,838
quantile which

810
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:48,160
means the the richest man um of India

811
00:38:44,838 --> 00:38:51,199
and the poorest man or a woman of India

812
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:53,598
the amount of cereals rice and wheat

813
00:38:51,199 --> 00:38:55,239
that they have access to there is not

814
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:58,800
much

815
00:38:55,239 --> 00:39:01,519
difference the difference is comes in

816
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:04,318
all the diversities in the excess they

817
00:39:01,519 --> 00:39:05,880
have to vegetables and legumes and meat

818
00:39:04,318 --> 00:39:08,759
and so

819
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:11,680
forth and therefore the problem doesn't

820
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:14,640
lie here and this this kind of a even

821
00:39:11,679 --> 00:39:16,480
distribution and excess is a huge

822
00:39:14,639 --> 00:39:19,679
success of Green

823
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:23,599
Revolution but the uneven success that

824
00:39:19,679 --> 00:39:27,838
came from non serials is a drawback of

825
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:27,838
of Green Revolution as well

826
00:39:33,358 --> 00:39:39,759
in a country

827
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:41,839
where as as we know um 53% of the people

828
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:44,240
depend on

829
00:39:41,838 --> 00:39:47,000
agriculture there is a there is a huge

830
00:39:44,239 --> 00:39:48,439
dependence on locally grown and locally

831
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:50,920
sourced

832
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:55,079
food and therefore Agriculture and

833
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:57,400
nutrition linkage in in India is is at

834
00:39:55,079 --> 00:40:00,440
its one of the strongest in the world

835
00:39:57,400 --> 00:40:02,160
world because because people basically

836
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:04,880
eat what they grow or what their

837
00:40:02,159 --> 00:40:04,879
neighbor

838
00:40:10,559 --> 00:40:15,920
produces

839
00:40:12,719 --> 00:40:19,439
so again perhaps as an implication of

840
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:22,079
the white Revolution or and and also as

841
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:24,200
a as a byproduct of country's economic

842
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:26,519
growth and income level changing the

843
00:40:24,199 --> 00:40:29,358
livestock sector as I said is really

844
00:40:26,519 --> 00:40:33,440
making making making huge shifts um if

845
00:40:29,358 --> 00:40:36,559
we look at the total um total output of

846
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:40,720
of livestock product in the country it

847
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:43,639
has uh it is more than all grains

848
00:40:40,719 --> 00:40:46,759
combined and the livestock sector again

849
00:40:43,639 --> 00:40:49,078
has grown almost on its own only meeting

850
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:52,760
the demand and Farmers sort of

851
00:40:49,079 --> 00:40:54,680
responding to the demand in the country

852
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:57,400
um

853
00:40:54,679 --> 00:41:00,078
so if you can see the livestock sector

854
00:40:57,400 --> 00:41:04,119
in the country is growing at the rate of

855
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:06,880
4.8% uh the the agriculture sector is uh

856
00:41:04,119 --> 00:41:06,880
you know now at

857
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:19,560
2.8 however one of the impacts of white

858
00:41:17,519 --> 00:41:24,679
Revolution and the potential that the

859
00:41:19,559 --> 00:41:26,519
dairy sector offers even today um you

860
00:41:24,679 --> 00:41:28,919
you know even if the livestock sector is

861
00:41:26,519 --> 00:41:31,519
growing and because of the large number

862
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:34,000
large amount of money of the government

863
00:41:31,519 --> 00:41:37,318
spent going into cereals and other

864
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:41,318
Commodities um as you can see the spend

865
00:41:37,318 --> 00:41:44,559
on the livestock is very very little so

866
00:41:41,318 --> 00:41:47,440
this is a sector that is growing double

867
00:41:44,559 --> 00:41:51,078
than this sector this is the sector that

868
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:54,318
is employing now almost double number of

869
00:41:51,079 --> 00:41:57,920
people than this sector and yet you can

870
00:41:54,318 --> 00:42:00,960
see that the that the the the PO policy

871
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:05,599
or the or the government spend is so

872
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:09,679
much more on on cereals and very little

873
00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:14,440
on livestock among the livestock spend

874
00:42:09,679 --> 00:42:18,399
87% of the livestock spend goes on Dairy

875
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:21,200
sector India has a large other sectors

876
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:23,480
such as for example the goat sector

877
00:42:21,199 --> 00:42:27,879
which is growing at the rate of 12%

878
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:31,400
right now 89 90% of the goat red is done

879
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:34,280
by rural women landless rural women and

880
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:36,519
therefore huge livelihood impact rug

881
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:39,280
rural development and social uh

882
00:42:36,519 --> 00:42:42,280
implications to it uh however there is

883
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:45,119
very little policy attention uh to to

884
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:47,680
that uh as well and we have prioritized

885
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:52,160
that as one of our uh major investment

886
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:52,159
areas and I'll I'll talk about that uh

887
00:42:55,719 --> 00:43:00,639
later so

888
00:42:57,679 --> 00:43:03,318
Rec recognizing that productivity is a

889
00:43:00,639 --> 00:43:06,400
challenge I really wanted to sort of

890
00:43:03,318 --> 00:43:08,199
brainstorm with you and and say that you

891
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:10,720
know increase in

892
00:43:08,199 --> 00:43:13,358
productivity increase in production in

893
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:14,959
some of the crops is not going to be the

894
00:43:13,358 --> 00:43:18,239
answer because that's not what the

895
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:18,240
farmers are looking for

896
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:24,679
also there are several things that needs

897
00:43:22,039 --> 00:43:27,119
to be combined and and we have we have

898
00:43:24,679 --> 00:43:30,159
you know historically seen that you know

899
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:33,800
our efforts in productivity and and uh

900
00:43:30,159 --> 00:43:36,679
in in plant productivity has not really

901
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:39,599
realized to its full value mainly

902
00:43:36,679 --> 00:43:42,159
because it has it has not been clubbed

903
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:44,838
with several other extremely important

904
00:43:42,159 --> 00:43:48,318
factors that the the plant productivity

905
00:43:44,838 --> 00:43:50,159
efforts needs to to hit the ground one

906
00:43:48,318 --> 00:43:51,920
is the extension you know having said

907
00:43:50,159 --> 00:43:54,799
again you know reminding you that this

908
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:57,400
is one of the fastest moving countries

909
00:43:54,800 --> 00:44:00,400
of the world this is one of the you know

910
00:43:57,400 --> 00:44:04,240
uh Agro leaders in the world and so

911
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:07,039
forth if we look at the the extension or

912
00:44:04,239 --> 00:44:11,318
or the knowledge to the farmers uh the

913
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:16,119
average is 40 which means only 40% of

914
00:44:11,318 --> 00:44:19,279
the Indian Farmers have access to any

915
00:44:16,119 --> 00:44:20,838
extension agriculture knowledge which

916
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:23,280
this is a this is one of the biggest

917
00:44:20,838 --> 00:44:25,558
challenges right so technology

918
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:28,680
development is an extremely important

919
00:44:25,559 --> 00:44:32,079
thing but you know with only 40% getting

920
00:44:28,679 --> 00:44:34,558
some access to extension knowledge or so

921
00:44:32,079 --> 00:44:36,640
forth how is the technology going to

922
00:44:34,559 --> 00:44:40,640
reach to the farm is going to be very

923
00:44:36,639 --> 00:44:42,159
very interesting if we if if you see the

924
00:44:40,639 --> 00:44:46,239
uh Indian

925
00:44:42,159 --> 00:44:49,838
R&amp;D system the the uh the Indian Council

926
00:44:46,239 --> 00:44:53,679
for agriculture research their rate is

927
00:44:49,838 --> 00:44:56,318
only 11% of the technologies that they

928
00:44:53,679 --> 00:44:58,318
develop which I think again still is an

929
00:44:56,318 --> 00:45:01,039
overestimate from their side but let me

930
00:44:58,318 --> 00:45:04,358
quote them 11% of the agriculture

931
00:45:01,039 --> 00:45:05,558
technologies that they develop reaches

932
00:45:04,358 --> 00:45:08,639
to the

933
00:45:05,559 --> 00:45:11,440
farmer rest all remains it's mainly

934
00:45:08,639 --> 00:45:11,440
because of this

935
00:45:12,599 --> 00:45:20,640
Gap very interesting angle to how India

936
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:23,240
has changed is extremely fast

937
00:45:20,639 --> 00:45:25,519
feminization of Agriculture you know in

938
00:45:23,239 --> 00:45:27,879
an economy where off Farm job

939
00:45:25,519 --> 00:45:30,480
opportunities are growing where roads

940
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:33,358
are being built and constructions are

941
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:35,800
happening everywhere and urbanization is

942
00:45:33,358 --> 00:45:38,960
is moving very fast and things like that

943
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:42,440
agriculture more and more is go is being

944
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:46,880
taken over by women

945
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:49,119
Farmers our policies our R&amp;D systems the

946
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:51,280
products that we develop in the labs are

947
00:45:49,119 --> 00:45:54,200
often not ready for this change and

948
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:56,760
there is a big mismatch between between

949
00:45:54,199 --> 00:45:58,960
those those two things uh you know from

950
00:45:56,760 --> 00:46:01,960
a policy angle there are major change

951
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:05,400
major challenges because uh you know for

952
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:07,920
a for a policy maker um you know

953
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:11,880
somebody who owns a land is considered

954
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:14,400
to be a farmer so any of the agriculture

955
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:17,240
reforms or any of the subsidy any of

956
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:21,720
these things goes to people who own the

957
00:46:17,239 --> 00:46:24,759
land women despite of over 40% of

958
00:46:21,719 --> 00:46:29,358
Agriculture work in India done by by

959
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:31,319
women the total land own by women is

960
00:46:29,358 --> 00:46:34,159
less than 5% in the

961
00:46:31,318 --> 00:46:36,318
country so there is a major major

962
00:46:34,159 --> 00:46:38,799
challenge there if you look at the

963
00:46:36,318 --> 00:46:42,880
extension services which I spoke about

964
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:46,760
earlier less than 10% of the Indian

965
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:49,640
women less about 40% of the farmers have

966
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:52,400
access to technology or

967
00:46:49,639 --> 00:46:55,719
extension in in case of women it is less

968
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:58,079
than 10 so these are some of the major

969
00:46:55,719 --> 00:47:00,879
uh major pivot that the country is

970
00:46:58,079 --> 00:47:02,640
making and and whatever efforts we do

971
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:04,920
within the country and from an

972
00:47:02,639 --> 00:47:09,679
international angle we'll have to keep

973
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:09,680
some of these major factors uh in

974
00:47:16,599 --> 00:47:23,640
mind I just wanted to very briefly talk

975
00:47:20,318 --> 00:47:27,000
about the end user or the client of the

976
00:47:23,639 --> 00:47:30,920
plant breeding efforts for example

977
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:33,880
the the efforts that we make from in an

978
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:36,838
international lab or so forth ultimately

979
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:39,000
I think it is very important to know who

980
00:47:36,838 --> 00:47:41,440
the client is and where it is going

981
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:43,639
right um I mean if you look at and all

982
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:46,440
these numbers that you see are the

983
00:47:43,639 --> 00:47:48,799
average number of a farmer in Bihar so

984
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:52,679
this is this is not madeup numbers these

985
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:56,559
are real state level averages uh that

986
00:47:52,679 --> 00:48:00,558
they have so if you look at the the farm

987
00:47:56,559 --> 00:48:02,640
in income it is $30 per month this is

988
00:48:00,559 --> 00:48:04,359
the average income people make out of

989
00:48:02,639 --> 00:48:07,118
the out of the

990
00:48:04,358 --> 00:48:09,598
farm um and and if you if you if you

991
00:48:07,119 --> 00:48:13,000
look at the consumption patterns about

992
00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:16,760
30% of what people produce is used in

993
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:19,960
the in the family and rest whatever is

994
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:23,280
there is used for generating income out

995
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:25,599
of it so if I see from a farmer's

996
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:28,800
perspective what happens

997
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:31,318
is let let me let me take an example of

998
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:33,160
a of a Dairy Farmer because there are

999
00:48:31,318 --> 00:48:35,920
there are no Dairy but if I look at the

1000
00:48:33,159 --> 00:48:39,679
example of this Farmer's cow

1001
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:44,119
right about 70% of the money that I need

1002
00:48:39,679 --> 00:48:46,960
to spend on that cow goes in buying feed

1003
00:48:44,119 --> 00:48:50,720
or uh you know in in feeding the animal

1004
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:53,480
okay now more I spend on the agriculture

1005
00:48:50,719 --> 00:48:56,199
input less is my margin on the

1006
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:58,679
profitability right and therefore that

1007
00:48:56,199 --> 00:49:01,879
is for fundamental reason why the

1008
00:48:58,679 --> 00:49:04,838
farmers adaption rate on agriculture

1009
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:08,400
Technologies uh such as seed I mean new

1010
00:49:04,838 --> 00:49:12,480
seeds new breeder breeder varieties um

1011
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:15,920
Animal Health uh you know aggro inputs

1012
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:19,000
are less because of course there is no

1013
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:22,240
appetite because your your that that

1014
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:25,519
margin between between how much you are

1015
00:49:22,239 --> 00:49:27,439
spending to produce your your crop or or

1016
00:49:25,519 --> 00:49:30,280
livestock and and how much you are

1017
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:33,798
earning from that is getting lower and

1018
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:38,680
lower and that's fundamental reason why

1019
00:49:33,798 --> 00:49:38,679
technology adoption becomes such a huge

1020
00:49:46,318 --> 00:49:51,960
challenge so just wanted to map the

1021
00:49:49,519 --> 00:49:54,358
major constraint this is again a farmers

1022
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:57,280
perspective to what are the major

1023
00:49:54,358 --> 00:50:01,358
constraints in agriculture okay what you

1024
00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:03,400
know every single day 2,000 people leave

1025
00:50:01,358 --> 00:50:05,639
farming in a country like India in a

1026
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:08,280
predominantly agriculture country like

1027
00:50:05,639 --> 00:50:11,719
India 2,000 people are leaving farming

1028
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:13,920
right and the the main reason is we see

1029
00:50:11,719 --> 00:50:16,000
it from a productivity angle we see from

1030
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:18,358
a climate change angle we see from lot

1031
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:20,119
of angle for a farmer there is only one

1032
00:50:18,358 --> 00:50:22,598
reason that there is no profitability

1033
00:50:20,119 --> 00:50:25,160
and I can make more money constructing

1034
00:50:22,599 --> 00:50:26,798
somebody's house right and so so that's

1035
00:50:25,159 --> 00:50:29,039
that's the reason that's the predom

1036
00:50:26,798 --> 00:50:31,280
minent reason now if we look at from a

1037
00:50:29,039 --> 00:50:34,599
farmers perspective these are the

1038
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:36,760
farmers key challenges in agriculture

1039
00:50:34,599 --> 00:50:40,440
why they think that you know it is

1040
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:40,440
becoming very difficult for them to

1041
00:50:40,719 --> 00:50:46,480
farm if we look at from a productivity

1042
00:50:43,798 --> 00:50:49,480
angle where a lot of the government and

1043
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:51,480
a lot of R&amp;D focuses these are the only

1044
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:55,798
two things which are related to

1045
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:58,639
productivity rest are all mostly nonfarm

1046
00:50:55,798 --> 00:51:01,199
nothing to do with agriculture kind of

1047
00:50:58,639 --> 00:51:05,279
uh kind of factors you know Market

1048
00:51:01,199 --> 00:51:05,279
related and and and so

1049
00:51:07,639 --> 00:51:13,759
forth India is one of the largest

1050
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:17,159
investors in agriculture in it it it

1051
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:19,599
spent something like $22 billion on its

1052
00:51:17,159 --> 00:51:24,159
agriculture sector which is one of the

1053
00:51:19,599 --> 00:51:27,720
largest uh in in developing uh

1054
00:51:24,159 --> 00:51:29,399
World however if look at where that

1055
00:51:27,719 --> 00:51:32,639
money is

1056
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:35,358
going these the sizes of these these

1057
00:51:32,639 --> 00:51:38,118
circles represent and it is it is it is

1058
00:51:35,358 --> 00:51:40,480
from an analysis of of all the different

1059
00:51:38,119 --> 00:51:43,680
government programs and government

1060
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:45,880
schemes the largest amount of money is

1061
00:51:43,679 --> 00:51:48,639
going in Crop

1062
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:51,119
Production now if you if you can please

1063
00:51:48,639 --> 00:51:53,558
remember the previous slide and and look

1064
00:51:51,119 --> 00:51:55,519
at the farmers perception this was a

1065
00:51:53,559 --> 00:51:57,839
very very small part of the challenge

1066
00:51:55,519 --> 00:52:01,440
that they were saying

1067
00:51:57,838 --> 00:52:04,558
the major part of the challenges was

1068
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:08,240
extension where the where there is very

1069
00:52:04,559 --> 00:52:12,359
limited effort so there is a there is a

1070
00:52:08,239 --> 00:52:14,838
major mismatch between between the whole

1071
00:52:12,358 --> 00:52:18,400
whole puzzle and and

1072
00:52:14,838 --> 00:52:21,679
therefore when we say R&amp;D you know

1073
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:25,000
Technologies are extremely important but

1074
00:52:21,679 --> 00:52:27,480
but I would really like to see

1075
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:30,318
Technologies not just just from a crop

1076
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:32,599
productivity or production angle but I

1077
00:52:30,318 --> 00:52:35,639
would like to see it from a slightly

1078
00:52:32,599 --> 00:52:37,880
wider angle to talk about what are the

1079
00:52:35,639 --> 00:52:40,920
various technologies that one can use

1080
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:43,838
for example Market access for nutrition

1081
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:45,680
and and so forth I mean Market access

1082
00:52:43,838 --> 00:52:48,000
for example you know having all these

1083
00:52:45,679 --> 00:52:51,118
challenges I I spoke about the Bihar

1084
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:53,199
farmer and and their challenges despite

1085
00:52:51,119 --> 00:52:56,599
of all those challenges and despite of

1086
00:52:53,199 --> 00:53:00,879
earning only $30 from agriculture the

1087
00:52:56,599 --> 00:53:03,359
other fact about Bihar also is 86% of

1088
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:07,000
the households in Bihar which is one of

1089
00:53:03,358 --> 00:53:10,078
the poorest states 86% of the households

1090
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:13,159
in Bihar have access to a cell phone

1091
00:53:10,079 --> 00:53:15,640
now and so how do we use these

1092
00:53:13,159 --> 00:53:18,239
opportunities to to complete the whole

1093
00:53:15,639 --> 00:53:21,879
picture and so that our productivity

1094
00:53:18,239 --> 00:53:25,039
effort also uh really really you know uh

1095
00:53:21,880 --> 00:53:27,119
realize in their value and and Farmers

1096
00:53:25,039 --> 00:53:29,199
you know even if the government effort

1097
00:53:27,119 --> 00:53:31,720
may be very little in these things

1098
00:53:29,199 --> 00:53:33,919
because it is a farmers priority you

1099
00:53:31,719 --> 00:53:35,879
know they they put in so much it is it

1100
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:39,240
is interesting I was talking to you

1101
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:41,160
about the the goat project that we have

1102
00:53:39,239 --> 00:53:43,639
this is a this is a goat project in

1103
00:53:41,159 --> 00:53:46,399
Bihar where a very very large number of

1104
00:53:43,639 --> 00:53:48,159
women farmers who are growing goats um

1105
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:50,240
we have a program with them where we do

1106
00:53:48,159 --> 00:53:54,039
the whole value chain development Animal

1107
00:53:50,239 --> 00:53:57,838
Health and everything and uh it was

1108
00:53:54,039 --> 00:54:00,119
fascinating to see these women on their

1109
00:53:57,838 --> 00:54:02,239
own absolutely zero credit to our

1110
00:54:00,119 --> 00:54:04,400
foundation or our investment or anything

1111
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:06,639
because we were focusing mainly on the

1112
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:09,920
animal health aspect and all that

1113
00:54:06,639 --> 00:54:12,598
completely on their own they started

1114
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:16,760
taking pictures of their goat with their

1115
00:54:12,599 --> 00:54:19,960
little cell phones and uploaded it on

1116
00:54:16,760 --> 00:54:22,559
the eBay like Indian site which is OLX

1117
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:27,280
which is an eBay like Indian site and

1118
00:54:22,559 --> 00:54:31,359
sold their Goat as far as a about 700

1119
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:33,960
800 kilm away and the the women who sold

1120
00:54:31,358 --> 00:54:36,318
their goat there they the the price that

1121
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:39,519
they go they got for their for their

1122
00:54:36,318 --> 00:54:44,440
goats selling it far from that eBay site

1123
00:54:39,519 --> 00:54:48,798
was was higher anywhere between 20 to

1124
00:54:44,440 --> 00:54:49,960
37% so you know looking at constraint

1125
00:54:48,798 --> 00:54:51,960
but looking at some of these

1126
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:54,199
opportunities and how they can use it

1127
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:56,559
and and you know very interestingly I

1128
00:54:54,199 --> 00:54:58,199
was um I was doing a seminar at Oxford

1129
00:54:56,559 --> 00:55:00,280
University and must have said something

1130
00:54:58,199 --> 00:55:02,118
like this and somebody challenged but

1131
00:55:00,280 --> 00:55:03,680
how can you say that because you know

1132
00:55:02,119 --> 00:55:05,680
there is there are so many states in

1133
00:55:03,679 --> 00:55:07,399
India where you know electricity is such

1134
00:55:05,679 --> 00:55:09,598
a problem how can you think that you

1135
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:11,720
know and I I frankly didn't have an

1136
00:55:09,599 --> 00:55:14,119
answer to that and I went back and spoke

1137
00:55:11,719 --> 00:55:16,679
to our field people and things like that

1138
00:55:14,119 --> 00:55:19,480
if you look at uh a place like

1139
00:55:16,679 --> 00:55:22,719
orisa there are rural entrepreneurs who

1140
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:27,358
have now developed what happens is on a

1141
00:55:22,719 --> 00:55:30,598
bicycle they have a solar panel the the

1142
00:55:27,358 --> 00:55:32,639
young fellow goes to a village and uh is

1143
00:55:30,599 --> 00:55:35,559
in the village for 4 hours everybody

1144
00:55:32,639 --> 00:55:37,960
gets their cell phone charged he charges

1145
00:55:35,559 --> 00:55:40,280
some uh 60 Cent or something per cell

1146
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:41,838
phone he goes to another Village he gets

1147
00:55:40,280 --> 00:55:43,920
and then he comes back to this Village

1148
00:55:41,838 --> 00:55:47,599
every two days so every two days you can

1149
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:50,920
get your cell phone charged fully right

1150
00:55:47,599 --> 00:55:53,039
Amazon for example um you know there was

1151
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:55,760
a there was this thing about uh you know

1152
00:55:53,039 --> 00:55:58,079
can we sell seeds through Amazon and

1153
00:55:55,760 --> 00:56:01,000
some people thought oh my God how naive

1154
00:55:58,079 --> 00:56:03,039
right I mean who's going to buy uh seeds

1155
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:05,400
through Amazon there are rural

1156
00:56:03,039 --> 00:56:06,920
entrepreneurs in places like jarand and

1157
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:09,318
other states and this is happening in

1158
00:56:06,920 --> 00:56:12,519
Africa as well where they go to a

1159
00:56:09,318 --> 00:56:14,798
village with their little little laptops

1160
00:56:12,519 --> 00:56:16,559
the people gather around them they order

1161
00:56:14,798 --> 00:56:18,400
things online it could be a plastic

1162
00:56:16,559 --> 00:56:21,519
bucket it could be seed it could be

1163
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:24,200
whatever children's clothes the these

1164
00:56:21,519 --> 00:56:26,318
entrepreneurs order it online then they

1165
00:56:24,199 --> 00:56:28,078
go back and after 10 days whenever they

1166
00:56:26,318 --> 00:56:30,318
come back they bring their things with

1167
00:56:28,079 --> 00:56:32,640
them so there is a huge rural Market

1168
00:56:30,318 --> 00:56:34,400
opening it does not limit itself from

1169
00:56:32,639 --> 00:56:36,440
whether you have internet connectivity

1170
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:38,599
or not you don't have to have a computer

1171
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:40,760
at home to be able to order through

1172
00:56:38,599 --> 00:56:42,640
Amazon uh you don't need to have

1173
00:56:40,760 --> 00:56:44,480
electricity to be able to charge your

1174
00:56:42,639 --> 00:56:46,960
cell phone so there are endless

1175
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:48,798
possibilities so I think looking Beyond

1176
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:51,199
just the productivity and production

1177
00:56:48,798 --> 00:56:54,079
lens to technology development looking

1178
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:54,078
at some of these

1179
00:56:54,239 --> 00:57:00,038
areas and and that's what I just wanted

1180
00:56:56,880 --> 00:57:02,838
to you know breeding for profitability

1181
00:57:00,039 --> 00:57:07,359
and not just productivity I think uh is

1182
00:57:02,838 --> 00:57:10,400
is is an important aspect the reason I I

1183
00:57:07,358 --> 00:57:14,000
put these three points down this morning

1184
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:16,720
is because I'm cognizant of the of the

1185
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:20,519
international uh audience I'm speaking

1186
00:57:16,719 --> 00:57:23,038
to right when we at the foundation were

1187
00:57:20,519 --> 00:57:25,679
revisiting our India investment strategy

1188
00:57:23,039 --> 00:57:28,880
one of the questions that we constantly

1189
00:57:25,679 --> 00:57:31,078
asked ourselves and uh Brantley my my

1190
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:33,559
colleague is here from the foundation

1191
00:57:31,079 --> 00:57:35,760
also we kept brainstorming on this and

1192
00:57:33,559 --> 00:57:39,280
said what is it that our small

1193
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:42,200
Foundation like us do in a large system

1194
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:44,039
like India which invest $22 billion what

1195
00:57:42,199 --> 00:57:47,279
is it that we can do that the country is

1196
00:57:44,039 --> 00:57:49,400
already not doing right and there's when

1197
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:52,200
we came up with some of these things as

1198
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:54,160
to what are what are those value ads

1199
00:57:52,199 --> 00:57:56,439
that we can we can bring in and where

1200
00:57:54,159 --> 00:57:58,480
should we focus so breeding for

1201
00:57:56,440 --> 00:58:01,318
profitability would be one idea I wanted

1202
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:04,838
to bring breeding for mixed farming and

1203
00:58:01,318 --> 00:58:08,480
and I have an example of that and and

1204
00:58:04,838 --> 00:58:11,519
what I mean when we breed for a

1205
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:15,000
crop keeping the mixed farming system in

1206
00:58:11,519 --> 00:58:18,000
mind where we know that uh you know 60%

1207
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:20,960
of the uh of the animals farm animals

1208
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:23,400
are fed with crop residue and not by

1209
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:27,440
feed that is bought from from a

1210
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:30,240
shop breeding for dual purpose

1211
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:32,960
which is which is increasing the food

1212
00:58:30,239 --> 00:58:34,759
value of it also but also looking at the

1213
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:38,039
feed value

1214
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:40,559
because the feed the animal is equally

1215
00:58:38,039 --> 00:58:42,599
important to that crop farmer as it is

1216
00:58:40,559 --> 00:58:45,440
this and therefore looking at it from a

1217
00:58:42,599 --> 00:58:49,079
from a mixed farming lens rather than a

1218
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:52,400
than just a crop lens or a livestock

1219
00:58:49,079 --> 00:58:52,400
lens oh

1220
00:58:53,318 --> 00:58:59,838
sorry and my last point there was um on

1221
00:58:57,318 --> 00:59:03,119
on nutrition I think uh you know

1222
00:58:59,838 --> 00:59:05,838
nutrition in both ways in the in the

1223
00:59:03,119 --> 00:59:08,519
existing rice wheat system around the

1224
00:59:05,838 --> 00:59:10,558
world how do we sort of fortify that and

1225
00:59:08,519 --> 00:59:12,239
how do we make that more nutrition

1226
00:59:10,559 --> 00:59:15,720
because we know that it is not really

1227
00:59:12,239 --> 00:59:17,639
contributing to people's nutrition lead

1228
00:59:15,719 --> 00:59:20,118
how do we how do we augment and value

1229
00:59:17,639 --> 00:59:22,159
add there is one area and the second

1230
00:59:20,119 --> 00:59:26,358
thing is also about you know

1231
00:59:22,159 --> 00:59:29,719
diversification something simple like um

1232
00:59:26,358 --> 00:59:32,318
uh an early uh early Harvest late sewing

1233
00:59:29,719 --> 00:59:34,959
rice variety for example where a farmer

1234
00:59:32,318 --> 00:59:37,599
gets one whole full season in between to

1235
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:40,880
be able to grow legumes for example you

1236
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:43,640
know so so nutrition in In from from

1237
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:43,640
many many

1238
00:59:45,480 --> 00:59:50,639
angles

1239
00:59:47,519 --> 00:59:52,119
oh so keeping all this in mind um you

1240
00:59:50,639 --> 00:59:55,558
know the the foundation has been

1241
00:59:52,119 --> 00:59:58,720
investing in India since 2007 and we've

1242
00:59:55,559 --> 01:00:01,599
had a large number of uh Investments

1243
00:59:58,719 --> 01:00:05,358
they were they were interestingly like

1244
01:00:01,599 --> 01:00:07,680
any other uh uh Investments were very

1245
01:00:05,358 --> 01:00:09,838
production productivity oriented

1246
01:00:07,679 --> 01:00:12,679
Investments and we've learned a lot from

1247
01:00:09,838 --> 01:00:15,199
those we last year we decided to

1248
01:00:12,679 --> 01:00:17,798
completely change and revamp our

1249
01:00:15,199 --> 01:00:21,000
agriculture investment strategy in India

1250
01:00:17,798 --> 01:00:24,239
to respond to uh and to leverage on the

1251
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:26,519
government spending and so forth and

1252
01:00:24,239 --> 01:00:29,038
what we you know rather than looking at

1253
01:00:26,519 --> 01:00:32,159
it from a science or from a productivity

1254
01:00:29,039 --> 01:00:35,200
only lens we we see that whatever

1255
01:00:32,159 --> 01:00:37,679
efforts we make in India should be able

1256
01:00:35,199 --> 01:00:39,879
to contribute towards three things

1257
01:00:37,679 --> 01:00:41,960
income and not just productivity

1258
01:00:39,880 --> 01:00:44,880
productivity as a means to achieve that

1259
01:00:41,960 --> 01:00:47,519
income but productivity not as the end

1260
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:49,720
and so farmers income nutrition

1261
01:00:47,519 --> 01:00:51,639
especially the uh what we call it as

1262
01:00:49,719 --> 01:00:54,118
food system where Agriculture and

1263
01:00:51,639 --> 01:00:56,358
nutrition comes together and uh we have

1264
01:00:54,119 --> 01:01:00,119
a large program here uh with Cornell

1265
01:00:56,358 --> 01:01:03,759
University as well on on that uh and of

1266
01:01:00,119 --> 01:01:06,160
course keeping the the women Farmers uh

1267
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:06,160
uh in

1268
01:01:10,760 --> 01:01:17,640
mind of course I mean you know given uh

1269
01:01:13,639 --> 01:01:19,639
given the large uh uh geography we

1270
01:01:17,639 --> 01:01:21,920
decided to focus on a few things and

1271
01:01:19,639 --> 01:01:23,920
learn from that and take it to other

1272
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:27,440
other

1273
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:29,960
states yeah so the end I wanted to say

1274
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:33,240
you know it would be good to take a sort

1275
01:01:29,960 --> 01:01:36,720
of a holistic view um and not just look

1276
01:01:33,239 --> 01:01:38,919
at it from an R&amp;D perspective R&amp;D to do

1277
01:01:36,719 --> 01:01:42,038
what is the question that we should be

1278
01:01:38,920 --> 01:01:44,798
asking ourselves and uh we could perhaps

1279
01:01:42,039 --> 01:01:48,000
you know ride the elephant together in

1280
01:01:44,798 --> 01:01:48,000
Etha thank

1281
01:01:51,119 --> 01:01:56,640
you this has been a production of

1282
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:59,640
Cornell University on theb we at

1283
01:01:56,639 --> 01:01:59,639
cornell.edu
