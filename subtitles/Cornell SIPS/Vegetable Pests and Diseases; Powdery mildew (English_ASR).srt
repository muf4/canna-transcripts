1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:05,160
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,359
University hello my name is keny

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:09,960
Rodriguez I am a PhD student of Cornell

4
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:12,719
and I am with I'm Chris smart I'm a

5
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:14,519
vegetable pathologist at Cornell and

6
00:00:12,718 --> 00:00:16,439
today we will talk about one of the most

7
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:19,278
common problem problems that we can see

8
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:21,199
in a curbit field and it's powder meu so

9
00:00:19,278 --> 00:00:23,679
we have Chris here so Chris can you tell

10
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:26,118
us a little bit about this problem and

11
00:00:23,679 --> 00:00:28,839
what is it and how we can recognize it

12
00:00:26,118 --> 00:00:32,479
absolutely so as Kenzie said powdery

13
00:00:28,839 --> 00:00:34,759
mildo is one of the most common diseases

14
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:37,119
that we see on cucurbit and that's

15
00:00:34,759 --> 00:00:39,159
whether it's in a farmer's field on a

16
00:00:37,119 --> 00:00:41,718
pumpkin field or zucchini squash field

17
00:00:39,159 --> 00:00:43,679
or in your own backyard let's start to

18
00:00:41,719 --> 00:00:46,079
talk a little bit about powdery Milos in

19
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:47,920
general um they get their name uh

20
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:52,600
because they give the leaf a very

21
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:56,239
powdery look and people will recognize

22
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:59,399
this because you see it on almost every

23
00:00:56,238 --> 00:01:03,118
type of plant there is importantly the

24
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:05,840
fungus that attacks cucurbits is

25
00:01:03,118 --> 00:01:07,719
different similar yet different from the

26
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:10,520
one that you might see on your Lilac or

27
00:01:07,719 --> 00:01:12,200
your peie or any of the other plants

28
00:01:10,519 --> 00:01:14,599
that you're growing there's a powdery

29
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:17,280
mdeo that attacks almost every plant

30
00:01:14,599 --> 00:01:20,559
that there is anything that we can do in

31
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:23,320
order to control or monitor yeah so

32
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:27,560
let's talk about what we're seeing first

33
00:01:23,319 --> 00:01:30,639
and if you look at this Leaf here um you

34
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:33,359
see this white powdery ex uh

35
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:36,799
appearance and it almost looks like

36
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:40,078
someone has shaken powdered sugar onto

37
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:43,240
onto the leaf itself uh what what you're

38
00:01:40,078 --> 00:01:47,438
actually seeing are the spores of the

39
00:01:43,239 --> 00:01:51,519
fungus so this fungus has a very unique

40
00:01:47,438 --> 00:01:54,398
life cycle you can't grow it in culture

41
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:57,959
in the lab which is pretty unusual for

42
00:01:54,399 --> 00:02:01,200
plant pathogens you have it has to grow

43
00:01:57,959 --> 00:02:05,280
on plant tissue like a Le Leaf surface

44
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:08,118
so uh the fungal spores like these here

45
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:11,598
one Spore will land on the leaf and

46
00:02:08,118 --> 00:02:14,479
it'll actually germinate and penetrate

47
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:16,799
into the cell of the leaf and that's how

48
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:19,639
it lives it actually essentially sucks

49
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:23,879
the juice from the plant

50
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:28,799
so knowing that um it's you what you see

51
00:02:23,878 --> 00:02:31,598
on the leaf here are the spores but the

52
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:34,200
actual body body of the fungus itself is

53
00:02:31,598 --> 00:02:35,839
inside the leaf you know you asked about

54
00:02:34,199 --> 00:02:39,439
oh are there you know what what do we do

55
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:41,840
how do we recognize it there are there

56
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:45,919
are diagnostic tools but really powdery

57
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:49,519
Milo is one of the easiest um diseases

58
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:52,238
to to identify in terms of control

59
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:54,120
strategies powdery Milo is somewhat

60
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:56,719
different from some other plants because

61
00:02:54,120 --> 00:03:00,400
it actually prefers the healthiest

62
00:02:56,719 --> 00:03:03,400
leaves on the plant so some some

63
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:05,360
diseases uh do best when you know the

64
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:08,519
plant uh the bottom leaves start to

65
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:10,440
sesse or or there's a wound powdery Milo

66
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:12,439
really likes that healthy leaf and the

67
00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:16,400
reason is because it needs those healthy

68
00:03:12,439 --> 00:03:18,359
cells to get its energy so if you if the

69
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,719
if you give if you give the plant too

70
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:22,640
much nitrogen and you have so many

71
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:25,280
leaves I mean this this cucurbit plant

72
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:29,119
has a lot of leaves here you know that

73
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:31,680
actually benefits powy MW um are we

74
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:34,120
going to see these mostly in like

75
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:37,280
younger or older leaves or it will be

76
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:39,280
distributed even and is are the leaves

77
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:41,039
the only ones that get the powdery or

78
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:44,120
can we see it in the stems of the plant

79
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:47,359
how um how is it distributed so in in

80
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:49,920
cucurbit you'll see it on the leaves the

81
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:52,360
pedals of the leaf like I'm just going

82
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:54,559
to pull this one right off um you can

83
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:57,760
see there's powdery Milo on the pedal of

84
00:03:54,560 --> 00:04:00,280
the leaf right there and you'll also you

85
00:03:57,759 --> 00:04:02,000
can also see it on the stem

86
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:05,640
of in particular you see it on pumpkin

87
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:08,039
fruit and it's a huge problem in pumpkin

88
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:11,279
uh if there's powdery Milo on the stem

89
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:13,359
that handle of the fruit gets weaker so

90
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:16,199
when people go you know you're at a

91
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:18,959
upick pumpkin farm and it's awesome and

92
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:21,280
you go to pick up your pumpkin and the

93
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:23,840
handle breaks off and no one wants that

94
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:25,478
and usually that's due to powdery mdeo

95
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:27,560
are we going to see any rotting over the

96
00:04:25,478 --> 00:04:30,120
fruit uh whenever the disease is press

97
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:31,319
in no the only way you would see rotting

98
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,639
H you know the powdery isn't really

99
00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:34,918
going to attack the fruit the way you'd

100
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:37,800
see rotting is if the powdery was so

101
00:04:34,918 --> 00:04:39,639
severe that um the leaves you lost the

102
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:42,319
leaves and then the fruit could get Suns

103
00:04:39,639 --> 00:04:44,560
scalded and then once it gets uh scalded

104
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:47,360
by the sun then you can get secondary

105
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:50,560
rots that might come in well pruning the

106
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:51,439
dis the diseased leaves will help um for

107
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,959
the

108
00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:57,680
disease so if if you prune early enough

109
00:04:54,959 --> 00:05:00,120
I mean anytime you get an oculum out of

110
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:03,720
the field you're going to

111
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:07,439
reduce the chance of spreading but with

112
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:10,280
powdery mildew there are so many spores

113
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:14,120
that it's really really hard to control

114
00:05:10,279 --> 00:05:15,918
by taking out the leaves um you know th

115
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:17,840
this plant itself you know probably has

116
00:05:15,918 --> 00:05:21,079
a million spores on it and this Leaf

117
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:23,000
isn't even that coated so it it's really

118
00:05:21,079 --> 00:05:25,560
hard and and you know there's you can

119
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,839
see it the powdery MW just starting

120
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:32,199
right there and you know you know that

121
00:05:28,839 --> 00:05:34,758
the fungus is is already inside the leaf

122
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:37,879
so taking off the powdery mildew

123
00:05:34,759 --> 00:05:39,840
infected leaves it isn't going to be the

124
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:42,038
best strategy for controlling this

125
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:43,839
particular disease if there if there was

126
00:05:42,038 --> 00:05:45,240
one leaf that was completely coated in

127
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:47,318
powdery mildew and the rest of the plant

128
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:49,759
had a lot less I would probably take

129
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:51,879
that off and get it out of there um but

130
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:53,680
in a especially in a large field

131
00:05:51,879 --> 00:05:55,519
situation that that's a tough thing to

132
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,240
do so is there anything that we can do

133
00:05:55,519 --> 00:06:00,159
for example are there varities that are

134
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:03,519
less susceptible to powder Milo

135
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:07,240
yes there are and there are um there are

136
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:10,478
cavars that uh have a k muu resistance

137
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:12,478
Gene and our lab actually is working

138
00:06:10,478 --> 00:06:16,519
with a breeder at Cornell Michael

139
00:06:12,478 --> 00:06:18,439
mourich and his lab uh has different

140
00:06:16,519 --> 00:06:20,598
cultivars that are resistant and he's

141
00:06:18,439 --> 00:06:23,759
actually trying to breed that resistance

142
00:06:20,598 --> 00:06:25,519
into winter squash um there's already

143
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:27,720
some resistance in melon and some of the

144
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:29,879
other cucurbit great is there any other

145
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:33,319
thing that you will um like to tell us

146
00:06:29,879 --> 00:06:36,719
about the disease or yeah um so powdery

147
00:06:33,319 --> 00:06:39,800
mdeo is is also somewhat unique in that

148
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:42,520
it it does best when there's high

149
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:46,120
humidity but not free water on the

150
00:06:42,519 --> 00:06:48,879
leaves so when when there's water on the

151
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:51,280
leaves the the canidia of powdery Milo

152
00:06:48,879 --> 00:06:54,759
are actually quite fragile they um they

153
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:57,638
don't do well in water uh but if there's

154
00:06:54,759 --> 00:07:00,639
high humidity they just Thrive so

155
00:06:57,639 --> 00:07:03,079
finding ways to keep the humidity down

156
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:05,199
is very helpful so in a in a really

157
00:07:03,079 --> 00:07:08,159
rainy year you tend to see less powdery

158
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:10,960
mildew uh however if you're in a garden

159
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:13,680
scenario and it's a dry year going out

160
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:15,439
and hosing down your plants once a day

161
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:17,000
is actually just going to increase the

162
00:07:15,439 --> 00:07:20,918
humidity so that would probably increase

163
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:25,639
the powdery MW um other things that

164
00:07:20,918 --> 00:07:27,318
um that uh uh girl will do is um that

165
00:07:25,639 --> 00:07:29,680
you know there are control strategies

166
00:07:27,319 --> 00:07:32,439
lots of uh different control strategies

167
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:35,000
for powder mildo uh because the fungus

168
00:07:32,439 --> 00:07:37,279
produces so many spores one of the

169
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,160
things that is fairly common especially

170
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:41,359
in well in all powdery milus but in

171
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:44,280
cucurbit powdery mildew for sure is

172
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:47,960
fungicide resistance so Growers are

173
00:07:44,279 --> 00:07:49,799
really careful about rotating Fungicide

174
00:07:47,959 --> 00:07:51,839
chemistries and making sure that they're

175
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:53,720
only using products that are going to be

176
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:55,399
effective against the powdery Milo

177
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:58,720
that's in their field in the hom

178
00:07:55,399 --> 00:08:01,959
Gardener situation um you might hear a

179
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:04,960
lot of folks talk about uh baking soda

180
00:08:01,959 --> 00:08:06,918
or other things to apply to plants and

181
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:09,000
there are commercially available

182
00:08:06,918 --> 00:08:12,598
products that are very similar to baking

183
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:15,360
soda and um those can be effective

184
00:08:12,598 --> 00:08:19,120
against powdery mildew uh especially on

185
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:22,080
a on a small scale if if I am a farmer

186
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:23,959
let's say I have a a lot of like corbits

187
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:27,000
on my field does this spacing will

188
00:08:23,959 --> 00:08:30,318
affect uh the absence or presence of the

189
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:33,519
disease yeah so any anything you can do

190
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:37,519
to to reduce the humidity you know in

191
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:42,158
inside of a very Lush plant will help

192
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:46,159
but because the the Canadia can fly a

193
00:08:42,158 --> 00:08:48,838
really long way it's spacing isn't isn't

194
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:51,039
going to help as much as you know as it

195
00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:53,839
would with other diseases so these

196
00:08:51,039 --> 00:08:56,559
Canadia um certainly can fly uh

197
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:59,200
throughout this field and to other other

198
00:08:56,559 --> 00:09:01,239
cucurbit fields in the area and then one

199
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,640
once they have the powder me do it will

200
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:04,240
they can blow in they blow in the wind

201
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:05,958
and they can blow in the Wind from there

202
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,680
so this uh mainly transmitted by the

203
00:09:05,958 --> 00:09:10,119
wind is there any insect that we can see

204
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:13,519
that can transmit the disease or only um

205
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:16,120
wind um wind is the wind is the major

206
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:19,440
way that the the passenger gets around

207
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:22,200
there are um it can overwinter in your

208
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:25,880
soil and I don't I don't see any here

209
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:28,240
today but sometimes if you have a very

210
00:09:25,879 --> 00:09:31,399
thick patch of powdery Milo like this

211
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:34,759
you'll see black dots inside of it and

212
00:09:31,399 --> 00:09:38,958
those are called uh casasmith thesia and

213
00:09:34,759 --> 00:09:41,958
those chth thesia um are actually the

214
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:44,799
the overwintering structure of the

215
00:09:41,958 --> 00:09:47,518
powdery mildew and those uh will fall

216
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:50,399
into the soil uh if this Leaf debris is

217
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:53,720
left in the field it'll get tilled in um

218
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:56,799
and and they will release spores in the

219
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:58,720
spring and that's frequently how this

220
00:09:56,799 --> 00:10:00,439
might get started so you recommend at

221
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,759
least getting get rid of like old plant

222
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:04,800
debris in the field yeah if at all

223
00:10:02,759 --> 00:10:07,399
possible getting rid of plant debris in

224
00:10:04,799 --> 00:10:09,120
the field um and um you know just

225
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:11,360
getting anything that's diseased out of

226
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,839
your field will be a big help okay

227
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,720
thanks chis so we just learned about

228
00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:16,800
part deio if you need more information

229
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:18,959
or want learn more about vegetables go

230
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:20,679
to the Cornell vegetable website and you

231
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:22,679
will find a lot of information there

232
00:10:20,679 --> 00:10:25,679
thank you thank you this has been a

233
00:10:22,679 --> 00:10:29,679
production of Cornell University on the

234
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:29,679
