1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:05,179
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:05,179
University

3
00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:11,580
and thanks Kevin for inviting me and

4
00:00:09,419 --> 00:00:14,039
really had a number of great talks this

5
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:15,780
morning with people already so the title

6
00:00:14,039 --> 00:00:17,579
of my talk is about the role of the

7
00:00:15,779 --> 00:00:20,219
Andes in neotropical plant

8
00:00:17,579 --> 00:00:22,500
diversification and after I sent that

9
00:00:20,219 --> 00:00:24,479
title I realized that I've only spent

10
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:26,118
about six months working on this topic

11
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:29,599
and so

12
00:00:26,118 --> 00:00:33,600
what you'll see is a lot about lowland

13
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:34,140
rainforest diversification and then

14
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,780
um

15
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:39,299
the latter part focused more exclusively

16
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:42,200
on the Andes which which is a sort of

17
00:00:39,299 --> 00:00:42,199
more recent development

18
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:46,820
um and as Kevin mentioned I'm very

19
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:49,700
interested in tropical forest biomes

20
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:52,980
this graphic will probably explain why

21
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:56,879
this shows the global distribution of

22
00:00:52,979 --> 00:01:00,500
tree diversity and we have three main

23
00:00:56,878 --> 00:01:03,358
biomes here we have arboreal forests

24
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:06,118
represented in blue we have our our

25
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:09,299
tempered Zone forests in red and we have

26
00:01:06,118 --> 00:01:11,159
our tropical forests in green and each

27
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:12,960
of these boxes represents the number of

28
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:15,659
species of trees in each of these

29
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:17,819
regions and this these numbers on the

30
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:22,799
side indicate the total tally so you can

31
00:01:17,819 --> 00:01:26,039
see 161 species about 1600 species here

32
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:30,180
and then 43 000 species in the tropical

33
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:32,640
realm so it's a huge diversity in global

34
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:34,799
terms in tropical forests

35
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,780
and then when you think not at the

36
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:39,060
regional or Continental scale but at a

37
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:41,340
very local scale there are many species

38
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:44,100
that are packed into very small areas in

39
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:45,259
tropical forests so in this forest in in

40
00:01:44,099 --> 00:01:47,759
Ecuador

41
00:01:45,259 --> 00:01:49,859
algentry noted that there were 300 tree

42
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:53,340
species All Above 10 centimeters in

43
00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:55,680
diameter in a single hectare of forest

44
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:58,200
so this has been a topic that's been

45
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:00,420
interesting to biologists for over a

46
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:01,859
century there are two main ways to

47
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:04,140
approach this question of why is there

48
00:02:01,859 --> 00:02:05,879
so much tropical diversity one is

49
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:07,920
through an ecological approach which

50
00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:10,500
would focus on why there are so many

51
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:13,520
species coexisting in small areas that

52
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:15,719
be focused on competition or bivory

53
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:17,640
the other way approach would be to look

54
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:19,318
at the evolutionary history of those

55
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:22,500
forests and that that's sort of the main

56
00:02:19,318 --> 00:02:24,839
area that my lab is interested in

57
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:26,580
laughs

58
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:28,860
um so the overall talk outline I'm going

59
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:31,080
to talk a bit about the history of the

60
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:31,739
tropical forest biome

61
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,800
um

62
00:02:31,739 --> 00:02:35,819
I'm going to talk more exclusively about

63
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:37,620
rainforests and particularly work that

64
00:02:35,818 --> 00:02:40,098
I've done on the phylogiography of

65
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:42,120
widespread rainforest trees

66
00:02:40,098 --> 00:02:44,699
and then finally I'm going to talk about

67
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:46,680
ambient plant diversification and its

68
00:02:44,699 --> 00:02:49,098
role in sort of creating all this

69
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:49,099
diversity

70
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:57,300
Forest history we have to go back to

71
00:02:53,479 --> 00:02:59,238
Alfred Russell Wallace and he noticed

72
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:01,980
you know way back in the 19th century

73
00:02:59,239 --> 00:03:03,599
that one reason why tropical forest

74
00:03:01,979 --> 00:03:05,280
probably had so much diversity is

75
00:03:03,598 --> 00:03:08,098
because they've been so stable as a

76
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:10,140
biome not only do they not have these

77
00:03:08,098 --> 00:03:12,359
very bitter Winters and you know

78
00:03:10,139 --> 00:03:14,759
dormancy that's required of of plants

79
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:16,319
and animals but also over geological

80
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:18,359
time periods they've been much more

81
00:03:16,318 --> 00:03:22,859
stable so they haven't been recently

82
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:24,300
wiped out by glacial glacial activity

83
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:26,400
um and so if we think about the

84
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:28,080
geological history of tropical forests I

85
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:31,080
want to just prevent present a little

86
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:33,019
overview this will take us back sort of

87
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:35,640
starting at the KT boundary

88
00:03:33,019 --> 00:03:37,980
k3t boundary is where we at least have

89
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:40,079
fossil records we know we had forests

90
00:03:37,979 --> 00:03:42,000
that are similar to Modern forests so

91
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:45,060
the KT boundary and Beyond in the

92
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,699
paleogene we have

93
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:50,219
here is our representative of the

94
00:03:47,699 --> 00:03:52,199
tropical forests and since we're already

95
00:03:50,219 --> 00:03:53,939
outside of the tropical region we have

96
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:56,039
to give another name for these forests

97
00:03:53,939 --> 00:03:58,139
this is what we call Mega thermal

98
00:03:56,039 --> 00:04:01,139
forests so these are forests that cannot

99
00:03:58,139 --> 00:04:03,719
endure any kind of freezing they're

100
00:04:01,139 --> 00:04:06,119
they're warmth loving so the mega

101
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:08,519
thermoforests extended all the way up

102
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:10,739
into New York Michigan during the

103
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:16,439
paleogene and so there's a much greater

104
00:04:10,739 --> 00:04:18,540
expansion of forests from 65 to 24

105
00:04:16,439 --> 00:04:20,279
million years ago

106
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:22,260
and this because the Earth was much

107
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:24,239
warmer and there was less of a

108
00:04:22,259 --> 00:04:26,099
latitudinal gradient in changes in

109
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,079
temperature

110
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:30,060
and we know that from fossil records in

111
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:32,758
Columbia that tropical forests were

112
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:34,978
highly diverse even in this very early

113
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:36,840
stage of rainforest development as

114
00:04:34,978 --> 00:04:40,758
diverse probably as today at least at

115
00:04:36,839 --> 00:04:43,258
the generic level level of Genera

116
00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:45,720
if we look at the neogene sort of the

117
00:04:43,259 --> 00:04:48,600
past 24 million years until the

118
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:51,300
beginning of the ice ages we had many

119
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:52,860
important developments for us the mega

120
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:54,960
thermal forests sort of shrank and

121
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:57,540
contracted into the equatorial regions

122
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:58,978
so now they're mostly within this

123
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:01,319
tropical area

124
00:04:58,978 --> 00:05:04,439
but we see a lot of developments

125
00:05:01,319 --> 00:05:06,120
geologically we see the the emergence of

126
00:05:04,439 --> 00:05:08,040
the Isthmus of Panama

127
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:10,259
which is a land bridge that connects

128
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:11,520
South America and North America allowing

129
00:05:10,259 --> 00:05:12,860
for the Great American biotic

130
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:15,299
interchange

131
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:17,280
we see the development of the Andes

132
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:19,139
Mountains during this this period in

133
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:21,299
time

134
00:05:19,139 --> 00:05:23,460
and so this is important in terms of the

135
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:26,460
development of sort of South American

136
00:05:23,459 --> 00:05:26,459
Landscapes

137
00:05:27,418 --> 00:05:32,399
and then finally the quaternary the past

138
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:34,860
2.6 million years this is a period

139
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:37,500
marked by Major climatic fluctuations

140
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:39,120
glacial interglacial periods and when

141
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:41,699
there were glacial periods that's when

142
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:44,579
the forests shrank the most in their 65

143
00:05:41,699 --> 00:05:46,680
million year history it's a much smaller

144
00:05:44,579 --> 00:05:48,839
extents than they were in the past 65

145
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:50,160
million years and this led to the

146
00:05:48,839 --> 00:05:52,560
development of The pleistine Refuge

147
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:54,180
hypothesis which posited that the

148
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,918
contraction of these rainforests would

149
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:59,519
have led to an accelerated rate of

150
00:05:55,918 --> 00:06:01,698
speciation during the past 2.6 million

151
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:01,698
years

152
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:07,939
and so this is the overall view if we

153
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:11,100
look back 65 million years to present

154
00:06:07,939 --> 00:06:13,860
this is these are proxies for

155
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:16,620
temperature Global mean temperature and

156
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:18,660
this represents a higher temperature so

157
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:22,500
the peak temperature was a sort of

158
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:23,699
paleocene eocene boundary and then our

159
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:27,120
global temperatures have got

160
00:06:23,699 --> 00:06:28,680
increasingly cool over the cenozoic and

161
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:31,560
now they're they're moving back up into

162
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:32,879
these areas but the area but the

163
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:35,699
temperatures that are predicted for the

164
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:37,379
year 2100 are similar to some of the

165
00:06:35,699 --> 00:06:39,720
temperatures that we see here in this

166
00:06:37,379 --> 00:06:44,659
neogene time frame and they're even

167
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:44,660
warmer earlier in the Earth's history

168
00:06:44,819 --> 00:06:50,699
yeah one thing that we discovered in

169
00:06:47,399 --> 00:06:52,318
just looking at the phylogenies of in

170
00:06:50,699 --> 00:06:55,020
the biogeographic history of the major

171
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:56,759
families that comprise rainforests if

172
00:06:55,019 --> 00:06:59,579
there has been a lot of movement across

173
00:06:56,759 --> 00:07:01,800
continents of rainforest lineages so

174
00:06:59,579 --> 00:07:04,258
even though we think of South America as

175
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:06,300
being isolated for tens of millions of

176
00:07:04,259 --> 00:07:08,220
years there's actually been dispersal

177
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:10,439
events that have been significant and

178
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:11,600
then that have resulted in the invasions

179
00:07:10,439 --> 00:07:15,000
of

180
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:18,120
Continental biotas

181
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,560
um very quick depiction of continental

182
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:20,720
drift

183
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:23,399
um

184
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:26,819
has about 65 million years worth of

185
00:07:23,399 --> 00:07:29,399
movement and at 3 million years ago we

186
00:07:26,819 --> 00:07:31,500
have Panama connecting North America and

187
00:07:29,399 --> 00:07:33,659
so we have this great American biotic

188
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:35,339
interchange but at many points

189
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:38,160
throughout the past 65 million years

190
00:07:35,339 --> 00:07:40,198
there have been migration events while

191
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:42,840
South America was an island continent

192
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:44,280
including from these megathermo forests

193
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:46,918
that were in North America and Europe

194
00:07:44,279 --> 00:07:50,638
which we call the boreotropics from

195
00:07:46,918 --> 00:07:52,799
Asian forests from Africa and Toby

196
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:55,259
Pennington and I tried to quantify the

197
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:57,120
impact of this migration and we looked

198
00:07:55,259 --> 00:07:59,699
at the yasini forest inventory plot

199
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:02,759
which is 25 hectares has 1100 species

200
00:07:59,699 --> 00:08:05,639
and we estimated that 30 percent of the

201
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:09,000
tree species and about 30 percent of the

202
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:11,900
biomass the actual stem counts came from

203
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,899
immigrant lineages

204
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:17,720
um so it's a very important impact of

205
00:08:14,279 --> 00:08:17,719
long distance dispersal

206
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:23,160
so this led to there are two major ideas

207
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:26,098
when I was a graduate student that I had

208
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:27,780
thought about about tropics and the one

209
00:08:26,098 --> 00:08:29,519
that is associated with Alfred Russell

210
00:08:27,779 --> 00:08:31,258
Wallace is that the tropics are a kind

211
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:33,778
of Museum of biological diversity

212
00:08:31,259 --> 00:08:36,418
because of the state stability of this

213
00:08:33,778 --> 00:08:38,059
biome and their long history and being

214
00:08:36,418 --> 00:08:40,439
even more expansive than they are today

215
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:43,079
species will be able to accumulate over

216
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:45,779
time without much of an Extinction rate

217
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:47,940
and so under this model you'd expect to

218
00:08:45,778 --> 00:08:49,860
have fairly old lineages that go all the

219
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:51,899
way back through the center Zerg

220
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:54,000
but under a cradle model this is where

221
00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:56,519
these other ideas about you know the

222
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,980
impact of potential pleistocene refugia

223
00:08:56,519 --> 00:09:00,778
coming into play or maybe you know more

224
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:03,600
recent geological developments driving

225
00:09:00,778 --> 00:09:05,458
speciation under those models the

226
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,620
tropics may be an area of active

227
00:09:05,458 --> 00:09:09,299
speciation with high Extinction rates

228
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:11,159
where you would expect most of the

229
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:12,958
diversity to be more recent in origin

230
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:15,500
and that's kind of broadly called a

231
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:15,500
cradle model

232
00:09:15,899 --> 00:09:20,159
and we can represent that

233
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:22,139
phylogenetically under a museum model if

234
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:24,600
we think back through the synagogue from

235
00:09:22,139 --> 00:09:27,240
the present back to the KT boundary or

236
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:30,300
the kpg boundary under a museum model

237
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:33,120
we'd expect common ancestors of our our

238
00:09:30,299 --> 00:09:35,399
species in general to sort of coalesce

239
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:37,379
going way back through the past 65

240
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:39,419
million years whereas under a cradle

241
00:09:37,379 --> 00:09:44,720
model we expect very small Branch

242
00:09:39,419 --> 00:09:44,719
lengths and more recent diversification

243
00:09:47,339 --> 00:09:53,339
an example of the the Cradle model was

244
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:56,820
founded in the genus Inga so Inga is a

245
00:09:53,339 --> 00:09:59,279
tree genus about 300 tree species only

246
00:09:56,820 --> 00:10:02,220
found in neotropical forests most of the

247
00:09:59,278 --> 00:10:04,019
species are widely distributed and

248
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:06,000
morphologically very distinctive from

249
00:10:04,019 --> 00:10:08,278
one another

250
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,139
um Toby Pennington James Richardson and

251
00:10:08,278 --> 00:10:11,580
colleagues tried to work out a phylogeny

252
00:10:10,139 --> 00:10:12,778
and found that they couldn't work out

253
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:14,580
the phylogeny there was not enough

254
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:16,980
phylogenetic resolution not enough

255
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:20,220
genetic Divergence among the species

256
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:23,159
and they placed the the genus phylogeny

257
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:25,800
into the broader legume phylogeny

258
00:10:23,159 --> 00:10:27,719
and estimated that the genus arose 6 to

259
00:10:25,799 --> 00:10:29,519
10 million years ago

260
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:32,519
with two-thirds of the species

261
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:34,679
originating during quaternary

262
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:36,839
which was consistent with sort of a

263
00:10:34,679 --> 00:10:39,419
pleistocene refuge hypothesis

264
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:41,339
and they they suggested that you know

265
00:10:39,419 --> 00:10:44,519
this is this may be the case with most

266
00:10:41,339 --> 00:10:46,740
Amazon tree species that uh most Amazon

267
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:48,839
trees may actually be very recent in

268
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:52,019
origin

269
00:10:48,839 --> 00:10:54,060
so my my supervisor postdoc collaborator

270
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:55,860
at the time and I were invited to write

271
00:10:54,059 --> 00:10:58,018
a perspective piece in science for this

272
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:58,800
article and it just didn't strike us as

273
00:10:58,019 --> 00:11:01,139
being

274
00:10:58,799 --> 00:11:03,359
very realistic and the reason being is

275
00:11:01,139 --> 00:11:05,100
that when we think about the force that

276
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:08,399
we were familiar with in Bar Colorado

277
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:10,980
Island and yasini there's a very deep

278
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:13,019
taxonomic structure so not only are

279
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:15,539
there lots of species but at higher

280
00:11:13,019 --> 00:11:17,220
levels the level of genus and families

281
00:11:15,539 --> 00:11:19,919
there's also a lot of higher level

282
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:21,959
taxonomic diversity so that for example

283
00:11:19,919 --> 00:11:24,539
in this yasumi Forest

284
00:11:21,958 --> 00:11:29,099
with our 1100 tree species in a 25

285
00:11:24,539 --> 00:11:31,799
hectare plot there are 333 Genera and 81

286
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:33,720
families of plants represented

287
00:11:31,799 --> 00:11:35,599
and so we can look at the distributions

288
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:38,100
of how many

289
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:41,579
species there are per genus on the

290
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:44,220
average so about 160 of those Genera are

291
00:11:41,578 --> 00:11:46,019
represented by a single species and many

292
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:47,579
of those Genera are in fact monotypic

293
00:11:46,019 --> 00:11:49,259
there are many gender that only have a

294
00:11:47,578 --> 00:11:52,379
single or one or two or three or four

295
00:11:49,259 --> 00:11:54,419
species they're species poor and so Inga

296
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:57,838
is actually the extreme extreme outlier

297
00:11:54,419 --> 00:12:01,439
it's a Genus that has 43 species in this

298
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:03,120
Forest plot so in this regard Ingo is

299
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:05,220
something of an outlier

300
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:07,799
and so at the time I was doing Philo

301
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:10,019
Geographic work and I became interested

302
00:12:07,799 --> 00:12:12,958
in particular in widespread widely

303
00:12:10,019 --> 00:12:14,639
distributed species that were found in

304
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:15,838
both in Central America and in South

305
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:17,759
America

306
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:19,920
and also thinking about the age

307
00:12:17,759 --> 00:12:21,120
structure of some of these species poor

308
00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:23,278
Genera

309
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:26,159
and so my first work was focused on

310
00:12:23,278 --> 00:12:27,980
Symphonia globulifra this is a species

311
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:31,078
in Ecclesiastes

312
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:33,360
it's very distinctive in rainforest it's

313
00:12:31,078 --> 00:12:35,759
something that I as a graduate student I

314
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:37,919
saw it frequently in manaus Brazil as a

315
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:39,600
postdoc I saw it in Panama when I

316
00:12:37,919 --> 00:12:41,699
visited French Guiana I saw it in Forest

317
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:45,000
plots there I saw it in yasuni

318
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:47,100
everywhere I traveled I saw it and and

319
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:50,458
interestingly enough it's also very

320
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:53,159
common and widespread in Africa

321
00:12:50,458 --> 00:12:54,958
um it has a very distinctive morphology

322
00:12:53,159 --> 00:12:56,458
which is very important because when

323
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:58,379
there's a thousand trees in the forest

324
00:12:56,458 --> 00:13:00,659
you want to be able to identify your

325
00:12:58,379 --> 00:13:02,759
species no matter which Forest you're in

326
00:13:00,659 --> 00:13:04,319
so I could always identify it to a

327
00:13:02,759 --> 00:13:07,799
combination of characters these aerial

328
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:10,379
buttress uh these aerial roots and a

329
00:13:07,799 --> 00:13:13,259
sort of a bright orange latex very

330
00:13:10,379 --> 00:13:14,480
distinctive globular flower

331
00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:17,338
um

332
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:19,860
and another really useful point about

333
00:13:17,339 --> 00:13:22,380
Symphonia there's only one species of

334
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:24,500
Symphonia found in the near tropics and

335
00:13:22,379 --> 00:13:27,299
it has a very distinctive pollen type

336
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:29,879
and the pollen has been used extensively

337
00:13:27,299 --> 00:13:32,458
by the oil industry for stratigraphy so

338
00:13:29,879 --> 00:13:34,799
if they want to find a character that

339
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:37,199
indicates that there's rain forest in a

340
00:13:34,799 --> 00:13:38,699
particular region or find the age of a

341
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:41,579
particular site they often look for

342
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:43,200
Symphonia pollen so we actually have a

343
00:13:41,578 --> 00:13:45,419
pretty good record of the fossil

344
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:48,560
distribution of Symphonia relative to

345
00:13:45,419 --> 00:13:48,559
other rainforest trees

346
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:55,860
so at the time they were that I was

347
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:58,078
doing the study there were no follow

348
00:13:55,860 --> 00:14:00,720
Geographic studies of tropical plants

349
00:13:58,078 --> 00:14:02,699
tropical trees and one of the things

350
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:06,720
that Drew me to Philo geography was was

351
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:08,940
traveling and so I was able to visit a

352
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:11,459
lot of these sites visit forests that I

353
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:13,740
hadn't seen before collect Symphonia and

354
00:14:11,458 --> 00:14:16,979
then I relied on herbarium material to

355
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:20,120
fill in the gaps or bury a material from

356
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:23,100
Africa and from other locations

357
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:26,539
and I use standard plant systematic

358
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:29,040
markers its chloroplast DNA

359
00:14:26,539 --> 00:14:31,379
not knowing that these would even be

360
00:14:29,039 --> 00:14:33,719
variable within this species

361
00:14:31,379 --> 00:14:36,059
so this is a these are the sites that I

362
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:38,820
visited and this is actually based on

363
00:14:36,059 --> 00:14:41,819
its internal transcribed spacer sequence

364
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:45,480
and each of these colors represents a

365
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:47,579
distinct haplotype or sequence and these

366
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:49,560
uh these circles sort of show the

367
00:14:47,578 --> 00:14:52,319
clustering of where the related

368
00:14:49,559 --> 00:14:54,719
haplotypes occurred

369
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:58,079
um so there's an Amazonian group

370
00:14:54,720 --> 00:15:00,480
a an area west of the Andes up through

371
00:14:58,078 --> 00:15:03,778
Central America it's highly diverse it

372
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:06,180
constitutes a clade a West Indian clade

373
00:15:03,778 --> 00:15:08,639
and then this this African group and

374
00:15:06,179 --> 00:15:11,159
this shows the fossil history so

375
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:13,500
Symphonia fossil pollen first occurs

376
00:15:11,159 --> 00:15:17,039
about 45 million years ago off the coast

377
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:18,120
of Nigeria so very old as a Genus at

378
00:15:17,039 --> 00:15:20,338
least

379
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:23,100
the first neotropical records are off

380
00:15:20,339 --> 00:15:25,500
the coast of Brazil and in the Maracaibo

381
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:26,459
Basin in Venezuela at about 15 million

382
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:28,799
years ago

383
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:30,778
and then in Central America we have the

384
00:15:28,799 --> 00:15:31,799
first fossils appearing about 8 million

385
00:15:30,778 --> 00:15:33,539
years ago

386
00:15:31,799 --> 00:15:35,899
so just based on that fossil information

387
00:15:33,539 --> 00:15:40,019
and Loan

388
00:15:35,899 --> 00:15:42,839
we can infer that there have been some

389
00:15:40,019 --> 00:15:44,399
Oceanic dispersal event that led to the

390
00:15:42,839 --> 00:15:48,380
establishment of symphony in the Amazon

391
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:48,379
basin sometime in the Maya scene

392
00:15:48,919 --> 00:15:53,458
because the West Indies have always been

393
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:55,860
islands and this is a very distinctive

394
00:15:53,458 --> 00:15:57,599
genetic group this would have had to

395
00:15:55,860 --> 00:16:00,480
have derived either from South America

396
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:02,459
or from Africa and then there there had

397
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:04,019
to have been assuming that there was no

398
00:16:02,458 --> 00:16:05,698
Isthmus of Panama eight million years

399
00:16:04,019 --> 00:16:07,740
ago there had to been dispersal from

400
00:16:05,698 --> 00:16:10,759
South America into Central America by

401
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:10,759
Oceanic currents

402
00:16:12,198 --> 00:16:17,278
this is the phylogenetic reconstruction

403
00:16:14,458 --> 00:16:19,679
of Symphonia and all the other species

404
00:16:17,278 --> 00:16:21,480
of Symphonia beside Symphonia globulifra

405
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:23,698
are found in Madagascar there are about

406
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:25,800
20 species of Symphonia Madagascar and

407
00:16:23,698 --> 00:16:27,778
then one species everywhere else these

408
00:16:25,799 --> 00:16:31,139
are the Madagascar the madagascan

409
00:16:27,778 --> 00:16:34,139
species and these are uh

410
00:16:31,139 --> 00:16:36,480
the clades within West Africa and then

411
00:16:34,139 --> 00:16:38,039
sister to this neotropical group so

412
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:41,339
there's a clay that's just sort of the

413
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:43,740
Amazon region and Guyana shield and then

414
00:16:41,339 --> 00:16:45,420
one that's in the trans Andes I use the

415
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:48,120
15 million year fossils to sort of

416
00:16:45,419 --> 00:16:49,439
calibrate this clade in that um

417
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:51,360
gave me

418
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:52,680
you know approximately seven million

419
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:54,240
years at the age of the Central American

420
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:56,719
group which is consistent with the

421
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,720
fossil record

422
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:03,120
so the thing to note about this is we

423
00:17:00,839 --> 00:17:05,400
have this very high level of

424
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:08,160
phylogenetic resolution and phylogenetic

425
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:11,040
depth within a single widespread species

426
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:13,798
and the species is actually older than

427
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:16,500
the entire genus of Inga which has 300

428
00:17:13,798 --> 00:17:18,000
species it's a it's a Genus that it

429
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:21,119
co-occurs with in just about every

430
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:23,759
Forest but it's a very old species and

431
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:25,198
when I when I publish this work the

432
00:17:23,759 --> 00:17:27,179
editor of the journal said well this is

433
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:29,340
really a living fossil you should sort

434
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:31,559
of sell it as a living fossil it's very

435
00:17:29,339 --> 00:17:33,779
unusual just unchanged morphologically

436
00:17:31,558 --> 00:17:35,399
for such a long period of time the other

437
00:17:33,779 --> 00:17:37,500
interesting thing was what it revealed

438
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:39,059
about Oceanic dispersal leading to sort

439
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:40,619
of the assembly patterns of these of

440
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:42,720
these forests

441
00:17:40,619 --> 00:17:45,298
so obviously I had this great result and

442
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:48,660
I wanted to see what I could learn about

443
00:17:45,298 --> 00:17:50,339
other widespread species

444
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:53,160
so the next one that I looked at was

445
00:17:50,339 --> 00:17:55,699
saber pantandra now Saba you might be

446
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:58,019
familiar with is the K-pop tree

447
00:17:55,700 --> 00:18:01,259
it's one of the most enormous trees

448
00:17:58,019 --> 00:18:05,058
you'll find in the Amazon basin

449
00:18:01,259 --> 00:18:08,700
this is a selfie taken by Robin Foster

450
00:18:05,058 --> 00:18:11,279
back in about 1966 on on BCI in Panama

451
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:13,380
or Colorado Island this tree just fell

452
00:18:11,279 --> 00:18:15,538
down last year unfortunately this is

453
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:18,720
called Big Tree you can see it's got

454
00:18:15,538 --> 00:18:20,519
these huge buttress roots and uh it's

455
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:23,579
got these uh these little seeds that are

456
00:18:20,519 --> 00:18:26,759
wrapped in sort of a cottony silk

457
00:18:23,579 --> 00:18:28,379
um it's a very fast growing it grows up

458
00:18:26,759 --> 00:18:30,779
to two meters per year

459
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:32,940
it sort of establishes along river banks

460
00:18:30,779 --> 00:18:35,220
and the largest ones are along the

461
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:37,798
salamois river in the Amazon basin with

462
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:39,600
nutrient-rich areas

463
00:18:37,798 --> 00:18:41,819
a little bit of Natural History I love

464
00:18:39,599 --> 00:18:44,699
Natural History it keeps me going this

465
00:18:41,819 --> 00:18:46,439
is bat pollination of Symphonia taken by

466
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:48,058
photo taken by a colleague of mine in

467
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:50,100
Brazil

468
00:18:48,058 --> 00:18:52,200
so what I found with Symphonia is a very

469
00:18:50,099 --> 00:18:54,480
different pattern so using those same

470
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:56,179
sets of molecular markers this is

471
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:58,679
another haplotype map

472
00:18:56,179 --> 00:19:02,038
the bottom part shows the chloroplast

473
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:04,200
DNA so the chloroplast DNA using the

474
00:19:02,038 --> 00:19:06,839
most variable chloroplast region was

475
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:09,380
entirely monomorphic in other words no

476
00:19:06,839 --> 00:19:12,599
variation throughout Central America

477
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:14,760
Amazon basin and Africa absolutely no

478
00:19:12,599 --> 00:19:17,339
DNA sequence variation just one

479
00:19:14,759 --> 00:19:19,679
nucleotide variant in the west coast of

480
00:19:17,339 --> 00:19:21,298
Ecuador and there were some its

481
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:24,179
haplotypes but showing no

482
00:19:21,298 --> 00:19:26,160
phyloggeographic pattern whatsoever

483
00:19:24,179 --> 00:19:29,220
and it turns out that the other species

484
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:31,380
of Sabo are located in the Amazon basin

485
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:33,419
there are several other species so the

486
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:36,419
species likely originated in South

487
00:19:33,419 --> 00:19:39,660
America and it got through long distance

488
00:19:36,419 --> 00:19:42,000
dispersal probably the oceanic currents

489
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:44,880
arrived in Africa we know that it

490
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:47,519
arrived in Africa before pre-columbian

491
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:49,919
times because there are records of Arab

492
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:52,319
traders moving the species in the 10th

493
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:55,380
Century into Asia

494
00:19:52,319 --> 00:19:57,659
um so it naturally got into Africa but

495
00:19:55,380 --> 00:20:01,020
over a very recent time scale and very

496
00:19:57,660 --> 00:20:04,200
weak phyloggeographic structure

497
00:20:01,019 --> 00:20:04,859
and probably not a very old species

498
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:07,519
um

499
00:20:04,859 --> 00:20:07,519
in general

500
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:13,200
so then I became well okay we have these

501
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:15,298
extreme cases we have one widespread

502
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:19,200
species it's very charismatic and well

503
00:20:15,298 --> 00:20:21,359
known but a very recent in origin and we

504
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:23,220
have another one that's very ancient and

505
00:20:21,359 --> 00:20:26,459
everywhere you go it shows deep follow

506
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:28,919
Geographic breaks and Divergence and so

507
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:30,900
I wanted to understand more about these

508
00:20:28,919 --> 00:20:32,940
patterns and I decided to focus

509
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:36,360
particularly on looking at the Andean

510
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:38,279
bear barrier and looking at populations

511
00:20:36,359 --> 00:20:41,399
that were located on either side of the

512
00:20:38,279 --> 00:20:43,259
Andes in Northern South America

513
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:45,720
this this was fascinating to me I was in

514
00:20:43,259 --> 00:20:47,759
Ecuador and I was reading the catalog of

515
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:49,798
the vascular plants of Ecuador and I

516
00:20:47,759 --> 00:20:51,720
came across a quote by Peter Raven and

517
00:20:49,798 --> 00:20:53,339
he indicated that you know right when

518
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:56,759
they were tallying the plant diversity

519
00:20:53,339 --> 00:20:58,798
they said that 30 percent of the plants

520
00:20:56,759 --> 00:21:02,460
found in little in rainforest of Ecuador

521
00:20:58,798 --> 00:21:04,079
are found on both sides of the Andes

522
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:07,319
and so that that account that's about

523
00:21:04,079 --> 00:21:09,720
1400 species so he said that about 30

524
00:21:07,319 --> 00:21:12,240
percent of the lowland Flora has been

525
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:13,980
around prior to the uplift of the Andes

526
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:15,779
and that may that means that a large

527
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:18,120
portion of these ecological communities

528
00:21:15,779 --> 00:21:20,339
have been really stable for several

529
00:21:18,119 --> 00:21:22,379
millions of years because the Andes are

530
00:21:20,339 --> 00:21:23,939
several million years old so I was

531
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:25,559
really interested in this idea and

532
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:27,900
thinking wow there must be large

533
00:21:25,558 --> 00:21:30,359
components that are very old in these

534
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:32,880
rainforest communities

535
00:21:30,359 --> 00:21:34,558
um and this is a situation known as

536
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:36,539
vicarians when you have a widespread

537
00:21:34,558 --> 00:21:39,119
population and then it's sort of broken

538
00:21:36,538 --> 00:21:41,519
up when a barrier Geographic barrier

539
00:21:39,119 --> 00:21:43,678
rises in the middle of it that's called

540
00:21:41,519 --> 00:21:45,839
vicarians so that vicarian's history

541
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:49,919
would indicate that these populations

542
00:21:45,839 --> 00:21:53,058
would have a neogene age be going back

543
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:53,059
prior to the pleistocene

544
00:21:54,259 --> 00:21:58,859
and so we have our northernmost Andes

545
00:21:57,298 --> 00:22:01,918
these are so the most recent part of the

546
00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:03,000
Andes to form in in Merida

547
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:04,620
um this would have been the final

548
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,140
barrier that would have been presented

549
00:22:04,619 --> 00:22:09,658
and the uplift of Merida Andes is about

550
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:11,460
2.7 million years ago sort of right

551
00:22:09,659 --> 00:22:15,120
between where the neogene and the

552
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:17,519
quaternary are and so as a way to test

553
00:22:15,119 --> 00:22:19,099
this I looked at uh estimated the ages

554
00:22:17,519 --> 00:22:21,599
of the ancestors of these populations

555
00:22:19,099 --> 00:22:23,759
and if they fell well within this

556
00:22:21,599 --> 00:22:26,038
neogene period that would support Andean

557
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:27,480
vicarians if they're a well in the

558
00:22:26,038 --> 00:22:30,480
quaternary that would indicate some kind

559
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:32,519
of dispersal to get around the Andes and

560
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:34,200
I just want to note that not only are

561
00:22:32,519 --> 00:22:37,319
the Andes important as an elevational

562
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:39,960
barrier but also right beside the Andes

563
00:22:37,319 --> 00:22:43,379
you have this really dry area the anus

564
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:45,659
and so any plant that is able to get

565
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:48,120
around the Andes is going to have to

566
00:22:45,659 --> 00:22:52,340
deal in some way with drought you know

567
00:22:48,119 --> 00:22:52,339
with drying dry habitats

568
00:22:54,779 --> 00:23:00,538
um so I picked I had 14 study species

569
00:22:58,079 --> 00:23:02,399
some of them were dealt with an

570
00:23:00,538 --> 00:23:04,319
individual case studies were sampled

571
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:06,120
much more broadly but for all the

572
00:23:04,319 --> 00:23:08,158
species I at least sampled in Panama

573
00:23:06,119 --> 00:23:10,079
Western Ecuador in the Eastern Ecuador

574
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:11,659
using these same sets of molecular

575
00:23:10,079 --> 00:23:14,339
markers

576
00:23:11,659 --> 00:23:16,760
and that included save a pentandra

577
00:23:14,339 --> 00:23:19,079
Symphonia glaviolifera

578
00:23:16,759 --> 00:23:21,359
as well as some other species that are

579
00:23:19,079 --> 00:23:24,480
fairly well known like acroma which is

580
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:25,500
the balsa wood producing tree

581
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:29,659
um

582
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:29,659
Jacaranda well known for its flowers

583
00:23:32,298 --> 00:23:36,119
and I also looked at well actually a

584
00:23:34,619 --> 00:23:37,918
student of mine Jordan demos looked at

585
00:23:36,119 --> 00:23:39,899
some functional traits associated with

586
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:42,059
these trees so he looked at drought

587
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:43,380
tolerance through ecological niche

588
00:23:42,058 --> 00:23:45,178
modeling we looked at where these

589
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:47,580
species were found some of them like

590
00:23:45,179 --> 00:23:49,798
Symphonia globulifra were only found in

591
00:23:47,579 --> 00:23:52,980
the wettest forests true rainforest

592
00:23:49,798 --> 00:23:54,298
whereas others were found in drier

593
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:55,798
Forest areas they were found in

594
00:23:54,298 --> 00:23:58,259
seasonally dry forest indicating they

595
00:23:55,798 --> 00:24:00,019
had more drought tolerant abilities we

596
00:23:58,259 --> 00:24:03,200
also looked at some other characters

597
00:24:00,019 --> 00:24:06,538
functional traits

598
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:10,440
so the results were that nine out of the

599
00:24:06,538 --> 00:24:12,359
14 species had a neogene aged population

600
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:16,380
structure so they had population

601
00:24:12,359 --> 00:24:18,619
histories that went back before 3

602
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:21,419
million years ago

603
00:24:18,619 --> 00:24:24,418
none of these species had much

604
00:24:21,419 --> 00:24:26,100
morphological variation despite these

605
00:24:24,419 --> 00:24:27,240
deep temporal divergences among these

606
00:24:26,099 --> 00:24:29,579
populations

607
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:31,500
and we also noticed there was this

608
00:24:29,579 --> 00:24:33,658
Association the species that did manage

609
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:35,119
to somehow get around the Andes during

610
00:24:33,659 --> 00:24:37,860
the quaternary

611
00:24:35,119 --> 00:24:39,658
those tend to be the drought tolerance

612
00:24:37,859 --> 00:24:41,219
species

613
00:24:39,659 --> 00:24:43,320
um and now we're currently looking at

614
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:45,120
more species we have 85 species all

615
00:24:43,319 --> 00:24:47,399
together that are shared between the BCI

616
00:24:45,119 --> 00:24:49,379
and the acne forest and we're using

617
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:54,000
other molecular markers particularly rad

618
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:56,100
seek DNA to analyze these divergences

619
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,839
but this figure just gives you an idea

620
00:24:56,099 --> 00:25:00,418
this goes back

621
00:24:57,839 --> 00:25:03,298
through this 10 million year history

622
00:25:00,419 --> 00:25:05,940
and we can see here's the age for our

623
00:25:03,298 --> 00:25:08,579
Crossing into Andy and Divergence of

624
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:10,620
Symphonia globulifra and it's not even

625
00:25:08,579 --> 00:25:13,500
the oldest species you know there are

626
00:25:10,619 --> 00:25:14,939
several species that have higher levels

627
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:17,220
of genetic Divergence between their

628
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:19,460
cross-andian populations then Symphonia

629
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:19,460
does

630
00:25:19,859 --> 00:25:22,859
there's this group particularly down

631
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:25,259
here this very old

632
00:25:22,859 --> 00:25:27,959
then we have a couple species of sort of

633
00:25:25,259 --> 00:25:29,940
the pliocene pleistocene boundary then

634
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:31,980
we have a group that definitely seem to

635
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:33,058
have their origin of quaternary or sort

636
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:35,099
of younger

637
00:25:33,058 --> 00:25:36,980
but you can see some of the things that

638
00:25:35,099 --> 00:25:40,879
species like Symphonia have experienced

639
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:43,079
they've experienced warmth Global warmth

640
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:45,240
warmer temperatures than are expected

641
00:25:43,079 --> 00:25:45,980
for the year 2100 or global climate

642
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:48,359
change

643
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:50,460
they've experienced the uplift of the

644
00:25:48,359 --> 00:25:53,538
Andes the development of the Merida

645
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:55,558
Andes the closure the isms of Panama

646
00:25:53,538 --> 00:25:59,298
these have been species that have been

647
00:25:55,558 --> 00:25:59,298
part of rainforest for all this period

648
00:26:00,359 --> 00:26:04,259
and this just shows this sort of how the

649
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:07,019
drought tolerant and intolerance species

650
00:26:04,259 --> 00:26:08,278
sort of segregate out so the drought you

651
00:26:07,019 --> 00:26:10,619
know all the youngest species are

652
00:26:08,278 --> 00:26:12,480
drought tolerant indicating that maybe

653
00:26:10,619 --> 00:26:14,579
that have played a role in allowing them

654
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:16,558
to get around the Andes so the Andes is

655
00:26:14,579 --> 00:26:18,899
really a filter it sort of lets the

656
00:26:16,558 --> 00:26:21,178
drought tolerance species through but it

657
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:24,200
keeps the rain forest Specialists on

658
00:26:21,179 --> 00:26:24,200
either side and separated

659
00:26:27,119 --> 00:26:32,519
so this isn't Alfred Russell Wallace's

660
00:26:29,759 --> 00:26:34,679
quote this is mine and it's just to say

661
00:26:32,519 --> 00:26:36,538
that alongside species like Inga which

662
00:26:34,679 --> 00:26:38,759
definitely do represent recent

663
00:26:36,538 --> 00:26:41,700
diversification in kind of a cradle mode

664
00:26:38,759 --> 00:26:44,278
there are many living fossil lineages

665
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:46,860
many lineages that are just hanging out

666
00:26:44,278 --> 00:26:49,679
in the rain forest for millions of years

667
00:26:46,859 --> 00:26:52,879
without much notable morphological or

668
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:52,880
ecological Divergence

669
00:26:55,679 --> 00:27:01,019
okay so where do the Andes fit in we've

670
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:02,700
seen how they fit in as a barrier but

671
00:27:01,019 --> 00:27:05,400
they actually contribute a whole lot

672
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:07,740
more to neotropical plant diversity so

673
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:11,538
here we have our our original photo and

674
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:11,538
here we have the the Andes

675
00:27:12,558 --> 00:27:19,220
so there are estimated 45

676
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:22,500
000 plant species in the Andes

677
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:24,600
44 of those are endemic to the Andean

678
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:26,278
region so that's a huge amount of the

679
00:27:24,599 --> 00:27:30,918
overall contributions neotropical plant

680
00:27:26,278 --> 00:27:30,919
diversity this localized on the Andes

681
00:27:32,579 --> 00:27:36,899
and there are many many important

682
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:40,440
linkages geologically between the Amazon

683
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:41,759
and the Andes and I've explored these a

684
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:44,700
lot recently in collaboration with

685
00:27:41,759 --> 00:27:46,619
geologists who will dispute every point

686
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:49,019
that I bring up today but but for the

687
00:27:46,619 --> 00:27:51,298
time being I find this a very reasonable

688
00:27:49,019 --> 00:27:54,298
scenario this is a review paper by

689
00:27:51,298 --> 00:27:56,460
Karina horn from back in 2010 and it

690
00:27:54,298 --> 00:27:58,679
shows the cenozoic development of the

691
00:27:56,460 --> 00:28:01,679
Amazon basin even before there was an

692
00:27:58,679 --> 00:28:05,419
Amazon River so at the very beginning of

693
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:08,100
the cenozoic 65 to 33 million years ago

694
00:28:05,419 --> 00:28:11,100
this is the Amazon drainage sort of

695
00:28:08,099 --> 00:28:13,019
moved in this direction and it actually

696
00:28:11,099 --> 00:28:15,359
flowed probably out through where the

697
00:28:13,019 --> 00:28:17,339
Orinoco River is and you see that

698
00:28:15,359 --> 00:28:19,139
there's not the Alpine habitat would be

699
00:28:17,339 --> 00:28:21,538
in Red so there's not much montane

700
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:24,140
habitat at that point it's just slowly

701
00:28:21,538 --> 00:28:24,140
developing

702
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:30,000
um and so as the Andes are uplifting

703
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:32,340
particularly these Northern Andes

704
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:35,640
they're causing uh

705
00:28:32,339 --> 00:28:37,740
these drainage patterns to shift and

706
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:40,440
they're causing to at one point shift

707
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:42,000
northward at one point develop a large

708
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:44,940
Wetland system

709
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,980
until finally they force the drainage to

710
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:48,538
move Eastward and so we have the

711
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:52,099
development of the modern Amazon River

712
00:28:48,538 --> 00:28:52,099
at about 10 million years ago

713
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:58,860
laughs

714
00:28:56,220 --> 00:29:01,558
we have the continued rising up of the

715
00:28:58,859 --> 00:29:04,079
Andes and as the Andes raise up all of a

716
00:29:01,558 --> 00:29:06,599
sudden it changes the climate

717
00:29:04,079 --> 00:29:09,418
it adds new precipitation there's a rain

718
00:29:06,599 --> 00:29:12,298
shadow effect there's lots of moisture

719
00:29:09,419 --> 00:29:14,759
now nearly available in this area and it

720
00:29:12,298 --> 00:29:15,960
also changes Global circulation patterns

721
00:29:14,759 --> 00:29:18,898
of air as well

722
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:20,940
and it also changing the Amazon basin in

723
00:29:18,898 --> 00:29:23,579
a very important Way by adding

724
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:25,259
nutrient-rich sediments so for the first

725
00:29:23,579 --> 00:29:28,319
time you know these are very ancient

726
00:29:25,259 --> 00:29:29,879
cratons that are Sandy and not very

727
00:29:28,319 --> 00:29:32,759
nutrient Rich all of a sudden you have

728
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:34,620
these new parent material rising up and

729
00:29:32,759 --> 00:29:36,960
depositing all kinds of sediments into

730
00:29:34,619 --> 00:29:39,959
this region so it's changing ecosystem

731
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:43,380
properties like like carbon flux as well

732
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:45,298
as well as promoting different kind of

733
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:47,940
ecological niche

734
00:29:45,298 --> 00:29:50,158
then finally over the quaternary we have

735
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:53,519
the development of the giannos this dry

736
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:56,960
area and then all the climate changes

737
00:29:53,519 --> 00:29:56,960
that are associated with the ice ages

738
00:29:59,819 --> 00:30:05,099
in terms of biogeographic processes I've

739
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:06,839
discussed a lot about how the Andes work

740
00:30:05,099 --> 00:30:09,658
as a barrier

741
00:30:06,839 --> 00:30:11,519
um and it's a barrier to up of 30

742
00:30:09,659 --> 00:30:14,000
percent of the rainforest species in

743
00:30:11,519 --> 00:30:14,000
Ecuador

744
00:30:15,179 --> 00:30:21,298
it acts as a corridor particularly for

745
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:22,980
temperate zone species to actually move

746
00:30:21,298 --> 00:30:25,798
into this region in Northern South

747
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:28,380
America and potentially most of them are

748
00:30:25,798 --> 00:30:30,179
are residing in this region in in

749
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:33,740
speciating when they get here some of

750
00:30:30,179 --> 00:30:33,740
them actually do move into the lowlands

751
00:30:35,579 --> 00:30:39,480
and of course it's acting as a

752
00:30:37,558 --> 00:30:41,359
speciation pump or a cradle of

753
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:44,940
diversification

754
00:30:41,359 --> 00:30:47,178
certainly the Alpine habitats have seen

755
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:49,320
an incredible amount of diversification

756
00:30:47,179 --> 00:30:51,419
but I think that with these new

757
00:30:49,319 --> 00:30:53,700
sediments that were formed in the slopes

758
00:30:51,419 --> 00:30:55,919
of the Andes I think that also promoted

759
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:57,620
some diversification and I think that

760
00:30:55,919 --> 00:31:00,419
may be where we have

761
00:30:57,619 --> 00:31:02,939
Inga playing out because Inga has its

762
00:31:00,419 --> 00:31:05,520
Center of distribution as a Genus on

763
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:07,700
sort of this slope of the Andes

764
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:07,700
foreign

765
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:16,019
this is a great review paper by Lou Bird

766
00:31:13,319 --> 00:31:18,178
and wagon that came out recently there

767
00:31:16,019 --> 00:31:20,940
have been a lot of phylogenetic studies

768
00:31:18,179 --> 00:31:22,860
of clades in the Andean region and they

769
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:24,778
did a synthesis of the of these studies

770
00:31:22,859 --> 00:31:27,418
and they tried to place all the ones

771
00:31:24,778 --> 00:31:29,940
that had any kind of age estimates

772
00:31:27,419 --> 00:31:31,620
associated with them into context and

773
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:33,899
they Associated them with different

774
00:31:31,619 --> 00:31:36,658
regions of the Andes so they separate

775
00:31:33,898 --> 00:31:39,058
the Andes into a northern region sort of

776
00:31:36,659 --> 00:31:41,240
a North Central and Central Andean

777
00:31:39,058 --> 00:31:44,339
region in the southern Andes

778
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:47,399
and these are progressively younger As

779
00:31:44,339 --> 00:31:50,459
you move north southern Andes being

780
00:31:47,398 --> 00:31:53,418
potentially the oldest part of the Andes

781
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:53,419
and

782
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:58,919
and if you kind of squint your eyes and

783
00:31:55,980 --> 00:32:02,399
you know don't apply statistics

784
00:31:58,919 --> 00:32:04,799
you can see that the southern Andes do

785
00:32:02,398 --> 00:32:06,839
have quite a lot of older lineages with

786
00:32:04,798 --> 00:32:09,359
ancestors that go back into the myocene

787
00:32:06,839 --> 00:32:11,459
and for the northern andian Clays there

788
00:32:09,359 --> 00:32:13,740
actually are a lot that seem to have

789
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:16,019
their origin in the quaternary or the or

790
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:17,940
the pliocene so it is you know

791
00:32:16,019 --> 00:32:20,158
potentially possible that we'd be able

792
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:21,600
to sort of find this association with

793
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:25,220
the age of the mountain and the age of

794
00:32:21,599 --> 00:32:25,219
the clades that are associated with them

795
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:31,919
so this is a project that um

796
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:34,440
that I've recently began participating

797
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:37,259
in in this past year with a group of

798
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:40,080
geologists and we had funding from NSF

799
00:32:37,259 --> 00:32:41,640
from Frontiers and Earth System Dynamics

800
00:32:40,079 --> 00:32:43,678
and um

801
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:44,700
the goal of it there were geologists who

802
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:46,740
are really interested in the Amazon

803
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:49,019
biodiversity and how it was generated

804
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:52,140
and they also know a lot about Andean

805
00:32:49,019 --> 00:32:53,700
history and we wanted to get together a

806
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:56,960
group of people that were experts in

807
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:59,600
Indian uplift geomorphology

808
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:02,100
paleoclimatology contemporary climates

809
00:32:59,599 --> 00:33:03,898
ecosystem function and they really

810
00:33:02,099 --> 00:33:06,619
wanted somebody that could contribute in

811
00:33:03,898 --> 00:33:09,418
terms of the plant phylogenetic history

812
00:33:06,619 --> 00:33:11,278
or in Philo geographic history

813
00:33:09,419 --> 00:33:15,179
so we've been meeting together regularly

814
00:33:11,278 --> 00:33:17,159
and talking about these patterns and and

815
00:33:15,179 --> 00:33:20,640
some questions we have like in the plant

816
00:33:17,159 --> 00:33:22,019
side are we want to know like was the

817
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:24,778
diversification that we see in the

818
00:33:22,019 --> 00:33:27,240
Indian clades was that because these

819
00:33:24,778 --> 00:33:29,759
plants migrated into new habitats it was

820
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:31,500
very open and didn't exist before they

821
00:33:29,759 --> 00:33:34,259
just immediately started occupying these

822
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:37,019
novel habitats or as some people have

823
00:33:34,259 --> 00:33:39,179
suggested is it because these habitats

824
00:33:37,019 --> 00:33:40,679
are kind of like Islands so these

825
00:33:39,179 --> 00:33:42,840
mountain tops are like Islands so that

826
00:33:40,679 --> 00:33:44,159
whenever you have climate change these

827
00:33:42,839 --> 00:33:46,619
islands grow

828
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:49,440
and sometimes coalesce and then shrink

829
00:33:46,619 --> 00:33:51,359
back again and so this would be a kind

830
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:53,460
of pleistocene Refuge model applied to

831
00:33:51,359 --> 00:33:54,298
the tops of the mountains

832
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:55,740
um

833
00:33:54,298 --> 00:33:57,359
so we wanted to know sort of what are

834
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:59,339
some of those dry what is driving that

835
00:33:57,359 --> 00:34:01,319
diversification and also what are the

836
00:33:59,339 --> 00:34:05,519
major drivers of the diversification

837
00:34:01,319 --> 00:34:08,878
apart from allopatry with respect to

838
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:11,460
ecological niche important ecological

839
00:34:08,878 --> 00:34:13,618
traits some people Al Gentry suggested

840
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:15,780
that the ability to move into

841
00:34:13,619 --> 00:34:17,639
hummingbird pollination opened up a lot

842
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:20,339
of ecological space for for high

843
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:22,320
elevation plants as well as genomic

844
00:34:20,338 --> 00:34:24,539
evolution

845
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:27,419
um and then what is the contribution of

846
00:34:24,539 --> 00:34:29,699
the andeons associated species with

847
00:34:27,418 --> 00:34:32,460
lowland rainforest diversity

848
00:34:29,699 --> 00:34:33,480
thinking about Inga you know to what

849
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:38,000
extent did this cradle of

850
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:38,000
diversification impact Amazonian Flora

851
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:43,079
so we we actually will be gathering our

852
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:44,519
own data pretty soon starting this

853
00:34:43,079 --> 00:34:46,319
summer

854
00:34:44,519 --> 00:34:47,699
um but over the past few months what

855
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:49,019
we've done is we've gone into the

856
00:34:47,699 --> 00:34:52,799
literature and we've done a

857
00:34:49,019 --> 00:34:54,719
meta-analysis of existing studies and

858
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:57,180
this is a inventy collaboration with

859
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:59,159
Stephen Smith this is what when you get

860
00:34:57,179 --> 00:35:02,338
a Gmail from him this is how his face

861
00:34:59,159 --> 00:35:04,139
appears and anybody who knows him knows

862
00:35:02,338 --> 00:35:06,920
it that's exactly what he looks like and

863
00:35:04,139 --> 00:35:09,420
he's just like a beard in black glasses

864
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:12,539
and this is his undergraduate student

865
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:14,579
Carolyn who he's been actually getting

866
00:35:12,539 --> 00:35:17,000
to do all the work of developing scripts

867
00:35:14,579 --> 00:35:19,980
to pull out DNA sequences from genbank

868
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:22,619
Analyze them in large scale and we then

869
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:24,900
these uh diversification analyzes that

870
00:35:22,619 --> 00:35:26,460
are based on

871
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:29,039
techniques that were developed by Dan

872
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:30,539
raboski who is actually a PhD student

873
00:35:29,039 --> 00:35:33,960
here very recently laboratory of

874
00:35:30,539 --> 00:35:36,300
ornithology so any questions about this

875
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:37,679
he'll be giving a talk here in Cornell

876
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:39,500
in a couple of weeks so

877
00:35:37,679 --> 00:35:41,879
please hold your questions for him

878
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:44,159
there's a lot of mathematical magic that

879
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:47,460
happens in there that but what this

880
00:35:44,159 --> 00:35:52,639
shows is a phylogenetic tree with sort

881
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:55,260
of a heat map and it shows when you have

882
00:35:52,639 --> 00:35:56,900
changes or significant shifts in the

883
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:59,240
rate of diversification

884
00:35:56,900 --> 00:36:01,619
diversification being sort of the

885
00:35:59,239 --> 00:36:04,500
speciation rate minus the extinction

886
00:36:01,619 --> 00:36:05,039
rate and this is the net impact

887
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:06,838
um

888
00:36:05,039 --> 00:36:08,179
and so here we have a fast rated

889
00:36:06,838 --> 00:36:10,199
diversification

890
00:36:08,179 --> 00:36:12,059
slowing down and then showing a

891
00:36:10,199 --> 00:36:15,000
significant Slowdown

892
00:36:12,059 --> 00:36:17,400
for example in this clade here we have

893
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:19,079
the Andy and clade this is the the

894
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:21,960
common ancestor of the Andean Group

895
00:36:19,079 --> 00:36:24,539
which is shown here with this Green Dot

896
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:26,940
and there's actually no evidence for any

897
00:36:24,539 --> 00:36:29,159
change in the diversification rate when

898
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:30,480
this group reaches the Andes

899
00:36:29,159 --> 00:36:33,000
this is the kind of thing that we're

900
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:35,579
looking at with this data

901
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:39,420
um and blue being slow rate of

902
00:36:35,579 --> 00:36:41,900
diversification yellow medium red is a

903
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:41,900
rapid rate

904
00:36:43,079 --> 00:36:47,640
so that that example that I showed you

905
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:50,099
there was berberus you might be familiar

906
00:36:47,639 --> 00:36:51,259
with Japanese Barberry which is invasive

907
00:36:50,099 --> 00:36:54,838
in Michigan

908
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:58,800
so when this genus reached the Andes it

909
00:36:54,838 --> 00:37:00,179
it did speciate but not in any rate that

910
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:02,280
was different from the background rate

911
00:37:00,179 --> 00:37:04,699
of speciation in other geographic

912
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:04,700
regions

913
00:37:07,039 --> 00:37:13,019
this is one of the classic papers and

914
00:37:09,838 --> 00:37:14,820
really important paper in

915
00:37:13,019 --> 00:37:17,280
sort of explosive diversification

916
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:21,000
patterns in the Andes and this is a

917
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:23,220
Genus lupinus in the lupins and here you

918
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:26,460
can see the geographic distribution of

919
00:37:23,219 --> 00:37:30,239
these lupines and as soon as they hit

920
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:32,579
the Andes represented in Orange you see

921
00:37:30,239 --> 00:37:36,479
very very short Branch lengths and lots

922
00:37:32,579 --> 00:37:39,839
of species similar to that Inga tree so

923
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:42,500
a very recent explosive uh phylogenetic

924
00:37:39,838 --> 00:37:44,460
diversification accompanied by

925
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:46,920
incredible diversification at the

926
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:49,500
morphological level so these are some of

927
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:51,960
the some of the plants that evolved

928
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:55,820
during that radiation so including

929
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:58,320
everything from herbaceous to to trees

930
00:37:55,820 --> 00:38:00,780
this all evolved within a quaternary

931
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:03,559
time scale some of the fastest

932
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:06,240
diversification rates that were measured

933
00:38:03,559 --> 00:38:08,599
for plants or animals were published in

934
00:38:06,239 --> 00:38:08,598
that paper

935
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:15,119
so when we look at we pull out all the

936
00:38:13,199 --> 00:38:16,980
all the sequences from genbank for the

937
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:19,858
lupins from all over the world we put

938
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:22,320
them in a phylogenetic tree we can see

939
00:38:19,858 --> 00:38:24,299
that across all lupines there are some

940
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:26,880
areas and some of this might be affected

941
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:29,339
by sample size as well that are are

942
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:31,500
slower or slower evolving or more

943
00:38:29,338 --> 00:38:33,719
quickly evolving and here we have our

944
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:35,880
Andean group right here

945
00:38:33,719 --> 00:38:40,019
but you can see that there's really no

946
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:41,640
evidence for any significant rate change

947
00:38:40,019 --> 00:38:44,940
lupines

948
00:38:41,639 --> 00:38:47,400
evolve very rapidly in the Andes but

949
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:49,858
they're already evolving very rapidly in

950
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:52,200
the Rocky Mountains already evolving

951
00:38:49,858 --> 00:38:54,299
very rapidly in in the Mexican mountains

952
00:38:52,199 --> 00:38:57,299
and when they were in the Andes they

953
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:58,980
just continued to evolve very rapidly

954
00:38:57,300 --> 00:39:01,140
and uh

955
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:03,119
in all fairness the authors do recognize

956
00:39:01,139 --> 00:39:05,159
that in the subsequent paper so this is

957
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:06,900
just a general pattern of Lupine biology

958
00:39:05,159 --> 00:39:10,098
not necessarily something that's

959
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:10,099
specific to the Andes

960
00:39:13,099 --> 00:39:17,338
draba is a is a group that does show a

961
00:39:16,139 --> 00:39:19,279
strong signature of Andean

962
00:39:17,338 --> 00:39:21,420
diversification so

963
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:23,099
compared to all the taxes that are

964
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:26,579
outside of the Andes when it hits the

965
00:39:23,099 --> 00:39:30,740
Andes it's it it has a significantly

966
00:39:26,579 --> 00:39:30,740
increased rate of diversification

967
00:39:31,559 --> 00:39:35,338
festuka

968
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:37,500
um

969
00:39:35,338 --> 00:39:39,838
this is another one that shows a strong

970
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:42,119
signature of Andy and diversification

971
00:39:39,838 --> 00:39:44,659
but you also see that it shows a

972
00:39:42,119 --> 00:39:47,400
significant slowdown so it Diversified

973
00:39:44,659 --> 00:39:49,980
initially very quickly compared to the

974
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:52,139
rest of the clade of festuka but then

975
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:54,480
diversification rate slowed down

976
00:39:52,139 --> 00:39:56,819
and so this would indicate to me that

977
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:59,219
potentially this is a group that

978
00:39:56,820 --> 00:40:02,280
Diversified initially as these plants

979
00:39:59,219 --> 00:40:04,858
came into the novel habitat but they

980
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:08,960
weren't necessarily affected by the

981
00:40:04,858 --> 00:40:08,960
climatic fluctuations of the pleistocene

982
00:40:12,838 --> 00:40:17,940
valeriana shows a similar pattern where

983
00:40:15,719 --> 00:40:20,819
it showed a significant increase in

984
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:24,559
diversification initially followed by a

985
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:24,559
Slowdown to the present

986
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:33,000
so the initial results of the this

987
00:40:30,119 --> 00:40:34,400
meta-analysis that there's quite a lot

988
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:37,079
of variability

989
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:39,480
some groups come in they speciate to

990
00:40:37,079 --> 00:40:41,519
some degree not any different from the

991
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:43,800
background levels of speciation some

992
00:40:41,519 --> 00:40:44,960
groups come in and show real rampant

993
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:47,900
radiations

994
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:50,820
some of them show radiations and then

995
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:53,940
stasis over coming into more recent time

996
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:55,680
scales indicating that probably

997
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:57,179
my hypothesis is that they're

998
00:40:55,679 --> 00:40:59,098
diversifying initially as they reach

999
00:40:57,179 --> 00:41:02,098
these new habitats but they're not

1000
00:40:59,099 --> 00:41:03,180
terribly impacted by pleistocene climate

1001
00:41:02,099 --> 00:41:05,359
changes

1002
00:41:03,179 --> 00:41:05,358
foreign

1003
00:41:07,619 --> 00:41:12,539
so the Future Works

1004
00:41:10,519 --> 00:41:15,000
my colleague Steven Smith is really

1005
00:41:12,539 --> 00:41:17,159
interested in incorporating as much data

1006
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:19,320
ecological data as is possible into

1007
00:41:17,159 --> 00:41:23,159
these analyzes including biogeographic

1008
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:23,880
data so we want to look at excuse me

1009
00:41:23,159 --> 00:41:25,799
um

1010
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:27,740
the ecological correlates of these rate

1011
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:30,000
increases

1012
00:41:27,739 --> 00:41:33,539
we would like to also do more

1013
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:36,300
transcriptomic work we want to look at

1014
00:41:33,539 --> 00:41:39,259
the genus clusia which is in the

1015
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:41,880
ecclesiacy this is one of the only

1016
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:43,680
tree lineages that has cam

1017
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:45,660
photosynthesis which allows it to

1018
00:41:43,679 --> 00:41:47,399
photosynthesize in very dry periods it

1019
00:41:45,659 --> 00:41:50,279
has a combination of C3 and cam

1020
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:52,559
photosynthesis and this is a Genus that

1021
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:55,079
shows high levels of species turnover As

1022
00:41:52,559 --> 00:41:56,219
you move up slopes in the Andes and so

1023
00:41:55,079 --> 00:41:57,660
we're interested in looking at the

1024
00:41:56,219 --> 00:42:00,598
evolution of that photosynthetic

1025
00:41:57,659 --> 00:42:02,460
mechanism and how some of these may have

1026
00:42:00,599 --> 00:42:05,220
impacted

1027
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:06,539
evolutionary divergences within the

1028
00:42:05,219 --> 00:42:08,039
Andes

1029
00:42:06,539 --> 00:42:10,019
and we're also interested in working

1030
00:42:08,039 --> 00:42:13,079
with the geologists to better pull

1031
00:42:10,019 --> 00:42:16,519
together geological history with the

1032
00:42:13,079 --> 00:42:18,599
plant phylogenetic history in particular

1033
00:42:16,519 --> 00:42:19,980
biologists have been working for a long

1034
00:42:18,599 --> 00:42:22,800
time thinking that some of the high

1035
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:25,920
elevation habitats like the paramo are a

1036
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:28,800
certain age a maximum five million years

1037
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:30,900
but these geologists say that the ages

1038
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:33,000
of the eastern and western courtiers of

1039
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:34,320
the Andes are very different and in the

1040
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:37,199
western parts of the Andes which are

1041
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:39,599
sort of a volcanic origin as opposed to

1042
00:42:37,199 --> 00:42:42,719
origin by uh

1043
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:44,579
faulting that these might have a much

1044
00:42:42,719 --> 00:42:47,159
deeper history so we want to see if we

1045
00:42:44,579 --> 00:42:50,960
can find clades that are much deeper

1046
00:42:47,159 --> 00:42:50,960
in age than five million years

1047
00:42:51,539 --> 00:42:55,440
um

1048
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:57,839
so I'd like particularly thank Stephen

1049
00:42:55,440 --> 00:43:01,318
and Carolyn I graduated in Jordan in

1050
00:42:57,838 --> 00:43:03,900
postdoc Ashley Thompson and my uh

1051
00:43:01,318 --> 00:43:07,099
geological geogenomics colleagues and

1052
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:07,099
I'd be happy to take any questions

1053
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:10,280
thank you

1054
00:43:12,059 --> 00:43:17,099
so at one point you mentioned the

1055
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:20,660
genomic correlates if you're interested

1056
00:43:17,099 --> 00:43:20,660
in the area exploring letters

1057
00:43:21,079 --> 00:43:26,780
well one thing that this team is doing

1058
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:29,339
now is developing biologies based on

1059
00:43:26,780 --> 00:43:32,579
transcriptomics he said he'll take that

1060
00:43:29,338 --> 00:43:33,960
the transcribe it might be sixteen

1061
00:43:32,579 --> 00:43:36,240
thousand of them from a number of

1062
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:37,858
lineages and then perform a foreign

1063
00:43:36,239 --> 00:43:40,799
College genetic analyzes of those

1064
00:43:37,858 --> 00:43:42,420
various genetic groups and you can look

1065
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:45,240
to see if there are certain groups

1066
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:46,619
certain genes that are outliners are

1067
00:43:45,239 --> 00:43:48,719
evolving much more quickly we have

1068
00:43:46,619 --> 00:43:50,940
deeper branch

1069
00:43:48,719 --> 00:43:52,799
um and so that might be one way to sort

1070
00:43:50,940 --> 00:43:54,300
of get at what are the actual functions

1071
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:56,519
that are involved that are evolving more

1072
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:58,560
quickly than otters inside of these

1073
00:43:56,519 --> 00:44:00,719
groups that might perceive the

1074
00:43:58,559 --> 00:44:03,059
diversification before enables and to

1075
00:44:00,719 --> 00:44:04,980
move into the technological space so

1076
00:44:03,059 --> 00:44:07,440
that that would be one aspect yeah what

1077
00:44:04,980 --> 00:44:09,719
about things like looking at the living

1078
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:11,159
fossil lineages versus the more

1079
00:44:09,719 --> 00:44:13,679
dispersal

1080
00:44:11,159 --> 00:44:15,598
to dwell dispersed lineages or read sort

1081
00:44:13,679 --> 00:44:17,338
of changes they think they're done with

1082
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:19,559
it was like if you're a Symphonia for

1083
00:44:17,338 --> 00:44:21,599
example well one thing that I'm very

1084
00:44:19,559 --> 00:44:25,139
interested in is looking below the

1085
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:26,818
surface of species like sometharnia I

1086
00:44:25,139 --> 00:44:29,039
mean I find it hard to believe that it's

1087
00:44:26,818 --> 00:44:31,199
such a biotically challenging

1088
00:44:29,039 --> 00:44:33,719
environment such as tropical forest but

1089
00:44:31,199 --> 00:44:35,399
huge amounts of pest pressure

1090
00:44:33,719 --> 00:44:39,118
pathogens

1091
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:40,318
insect damage you know constantly that

1092
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:42,599
there would be a lot of evolution

1093
00:44:40,318 --> 00:44:44,759
happening that may have to do with

1094
00:44:42,599 --> 00:44:46,619
secondary defense or other traits that

1095
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:48,359
we're just not saved and taxonomically

1096
00:44:46,619 --> 00:44:51,200
so I I think that would be very

1097
00:44:48,358 --> 00:44:51,199
interesting to look at

1098
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:57,240
it the last few examples we presented

1099
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:59,119
are the various

1100
00:44:57,239 --> 00:45:03,539
et cetera

1101
00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:06,780
in a relative rate changes speciation

1102
00:45:03,539 --> 00:45:08,699
events I was wondering if there is a

1103
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:10,859
higher level pattern of vivacious and

1104
00:45:08,699 --> 00:45:12,480
Woody and that they fall out into these

1105
00:45:10,858 --> 00:45:13,920
categories initially and then you're

1106
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:16,019
looking for patterns within each

1107
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:17,880
category and that that's a really good

1108
00:45:16,019 --> 00:45:20,699
question and uh

1109
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:22,680
I think I want you to look at that these

1110
00:45:20,699 --> 00:45:24,838
are just the initial results now that

1111
00:45:22,679 --> 00:45:27,118
it's a very good point so they're all on

1112
00:45:24,838 --> 00:45:30,318
the same scale yeah I mean I'm not sure

1113
00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:33,180
if some of those groups it is

1114
00:45:30,318 --> 00:45:34,519
there's some Woody elements there but

1115
00:45:33,179 --> 00:45:38,000
I'm not sure if that applies together

1116
00:45:34,519 --> 00:45:42,000
investigations about affordably

1117
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:46,099
and how that affected their Elementary

1118
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:46,099
yeah I would expect there'd be less

1119
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:50,579
for some reason but okay because of

1120
00:45:49,079 --> 00:45:53,539
longer generation times and things like

1121
00:45:50,579 --> 00:45:53,539
that but um

1122
00:45:55,818 --> 00:46:00,300
this is a more General and maybe like

1123
00:45:58,559 --> 00:46:03,358
naive question about a species

1124
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:05,700
diversification but after something like

1125
00:46:03,358 --> 00:46:06,960
a long distance disparation dispersal

1126
00:46:05,699 --> 00:46:08,818
event

1127
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:12,539
you know you might expect that species

1128
00:46:08,818 --> 00:46:15,179
to like diversify when it reaches its

1129
00:46:12,539 --> 00:46:19,079
new ecosystem but do you also see a drop

1130
00:46:15,179 --> 00:46:21,419
in species diversity that we're of

1131
00:46:19,079 --> 00:46:22,200
species that were already there sort of

1132
00:46:21,420 --> 00:46:24,300
like

1133
00:46:22,199 --> 00:46:27,838
the species that has come from far away

1134
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:30,599
is an invasive and how does that impact

1135
00:46:27,838 --> 00:46:31,519
the ecosystem that moves to well I think

1136
00:46:30,599 --> 00:46:34,260
um

1137
00:46:31,519 --> 00:46:36,358
there aren't many cases where we have a

1138
00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:39,359
long distance dispersal event whereas

1139
00:46:36,358 --> 00:46:43,619
species arise in terms of an already

1140
00:46:39,358 --> 00:46:45,598
species Rich environment diversifies I

1141
00:46:43,619 --> 00:46:47,039
think in the case of the ambient region

1142
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:50,700
I think a lot of attacks are arriving

1143
00:46:47,039 --> 00:46:52,800
there and then entering in an occupied

1144
00:46:50,699 --> 00:46:55,078
space because they're able to diversify

1145
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:57,180
and just like new islands you know

1146
00:46:55,079 --> 00:47:00,240
diversification without too much

1147
00:46:57,179 --> 00:47:02,879
competition and at some point there may

1148
00:47:00,239 --> 00:47:04,559
be a point where there's no longer much

1149
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:06,838
space to be made because there's a

1150
00:47:04,559 --> 00:47:08,219
certain carrying capacity but in the

1151
00:47:06,838 --> 00:47:10,380
dispersible event that I that I

1152
00:47:08,219 --> 00:47:12,838
mentioned there was never you know apart

1153
00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:15,180
from the ambient colonization there was

1154
00:47:12,838 --> 00:47:16,578
never much uh speciation after the long

1155
00:47:15,179 --> 00:47:20,239
distance ability

1156
00:47:16,579 --> 00:47:20,240
is not grounded

1157
00:47:20,579 --> 00:47:25,318
so how did you calibrate those metal

1158
00:47:23,338 --> 00:47:27,480
analysis again

1159
00:47:25,318 --> 00:47:29,759
so this meta-analysis don't have any

1160
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:31,619
kind of time calibration on them so

1161
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:33,240
they're just looking at the sphere based

1162
00:47:31,619 --> 00:47:35,880
on the numbers of those sort of the

1163
00:47:33,239 --> 00:47:38,358
relative ways so they don't really they

1164
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:41,460
don't really try to put pages on this

1165
00:47:38,358 --> 00:47:43,318
and it probably wouldn't trust any any

1166
00:47:41,460 --> 00:47:45,300
kind of NHS that you would put on it

1167
00:47:43,318 --> 00:47:48,619
which is not enough of a possible record

1168
00:47:45,300 --> 00:47:48,619
for this for this tax

1169
00:47:51,980 --> 00:47:57,719
and it's also yeah some of these methods

1170
00:47:55,079 --> 00:47:59,160
are dependent on technology sampling and

1171
00:47:57,719 --> 00:48:00,598
so

1172
00:47:59,159 --> 00:48:03,179
um

1173
00:48:00,599 --> 00:48:05,818
how extensively the sampling is done so

1174
00:48:03,179 --> 00:48:08,279
that there are many limitations

1175
00:48:05,818 --> 00:48:10,559
I'm trying to just sort of understand

1176
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:12,920
what these limitations are and what

1177
00:48:10,559 --> 00:48:12,920
questions

1178
00:48:14,818 --> 00:48:20,880
along the uh well these types of

1179
00:48:17,818 --> 00:48:25,440
diversifying species do they still cross

1180
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:27,838
hybridize and produce hybrid progeny

1181
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:32,280
um but I'm only very familiar with the

1182
00:48:27,838 --> 00:48:35,338
Inga and those species to my knowledge

1183
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:37,380
are very morphologically distinct and

1184
00:48:35,338 --> 00:48:40,078
without too many intermediates and they

1185
00:48:37,380 --> 00:48:43,700
also tend to have widespread overlapping

1186
00:48:40,079 --> 00:48:47,760
distributions so it's not as if they

1187
00:48:43,699 --> 00:48:49,559
speciated in small isolated valleys and

1188
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:51,960
then having that contact but somehow

1189
00:48:49,559 --> 00:48:53,759
they manage the species and then develop

1190
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:57,059
reproductive barriers to

1191
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:59,660
wider overlapping distributions for the

1192
00:48:57,059 --> 00:49:02,838
other groups of the Miami

1193
00:48:59,659 --> 00:49:02,838
cases because

1194
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:08,818
you have a

1195
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:10,800
population that's widely distributed and

1196
00:49:08,818 --> 00:49:13,199
then have it interrupted by the Andes

1197
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:15,900
how do you can you rule out this

1198
00:49:13,199 --> 00:49:18,059
personal algorithm is to attempt the

1199
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:20,880
similarities between the two components

1200
00:49:18,059 --> 00:49:22,500
yeah that was the main question is

1201
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:25,380
um like was that

1202
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:27,980
Peter Raven started suggest that this is

1203
00:49:25,380 --> 00:49:30,358
a sort of a My caring scenario

1204
00:49:27,980 --> 00:49:31,460
where the enemies just divided the

1205
00:49:30,358 --> 00:49:34,440
populations

1206
00:49:31,460 --> 00:49:37,440
for the alternative hypothesis is some

1207
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:39,300
kind of dispersal and

1208
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:41,818
what would be nice to do with you to get

1209
00:49:39,300 --> 00:49:43,818
enough taxes to just determine whether

1210
00:49:41,818 --> 00:49:47,039
that's been the case and there are some

1211
00:49:43,818 --> 00:49:49,559
relatively low areas in the Andes 2000

1212
00:49:47,039 --> 00:49:50,880
meters where conceivably some affordable

1213
00:49:49,559 --> 00:49:53,219
periods of time there could have been

1214
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:55,920
some kind of dispersal they're also did

1215
00:49:53,219 --> 00:49:58,078
a big dispersal in that sort of what is

1216
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:59,519
now Beyond us sort of along the slopes

1217
00:49:58,079 --> 00:50:01,560
of the mountains there are other

1218
00:49:59,519 --> 00:50:04,980
possibilities and also like in the case

1219
00:50:01,559 --> 00:50:07,039
of simonia and Seva yeah kind of done

1220
00:50:04,980 --> 00:50:11,179
around tradition and occurrence as well

1221
00:50:07,039 --> 00:50:11,179
before the before this was

1222
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:30,838
what happens when you start nesting

1223
00:50:27,619 --> 00:50:33,900
species which are inside into higher

1224
00:50:30,838 --> 00:50:36,420
attacks in your analysis in other words

1225
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:39,358
do you find that let's say a family

1226
00:50:36,420 --> 00:50:41,880
level with some families are prone to

1227
00:50:39,358 --> 00:50:45,000
throughout the diversification of slow

1228
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:46,920
diversification because there's always

1229
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:50,699
this idea as to

1230
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:54,059
is there something intrinsic to a Clay's

1231
00:50:50,699 --> 00:50:56,279
genomic potential to morphologically

1232
00:50:54,059 --> 00:50:58,319
diversity well I'm starting to think

1233
00:50:56,280 --> 00:50:59,339
that about legumes that I'd be

1234
00:50:58,318 --> 00:51:01,920
interested in what people have to say

1235
00:50:59,338 --> 00:51:03,679
about that but they've got every time to

1236
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:07,318
get into

1237
00:51:03,679 --> 00:51:09,259
legumes are a dominant family trees in

1238
00:51:07,318 --> 00:51:11,699
the rainforests around the world

1239
00:51:09,260 --> 00:51:13,559
so there might be something

1240
00:51:11,699 --> 00:51:15,899
there might be certain groups that

1241
00:51:13,559 --> 00:51:17,940
really can Diversified for some reason

1242
00:51:15,900 --> 00:51:19,818
available propensity for some reason or

1243
00:51:17,940 --> 00:51:23,000
another it could have to do with their

1244
00:51:19,818 --> 00:51:27,838
reproductive biology or

1245
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:27,838
previzable supervisors symbiotics

1246
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:43,338
it did come up earlier you know

1247
00:51:43,940 --> 00:51:48,480
we didn't talk enough about it but I

1248
00:51:47,219 --> 00:51:50,818
think that would be very interesting to

1249
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:55,039
look into college that's what I was

1250
00:51:50,818 --> 00:51:55,039
pushing for was correlation

1251
00:51:55,400 --> 00:52:00,559
that's the exploration did not Escape

1252
00:52:03,980 --> 00:52:07,579
I guess that's it

1253
00:52:11,719 --> 00:52:19,919
this has been a production of Cornell

1254
00:52:14,579 --> 00:52:19,920
University on the web at cornell.edu
