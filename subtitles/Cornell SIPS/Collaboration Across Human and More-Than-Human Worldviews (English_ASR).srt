1
00:00:13,199 --> 00:00:19,358
Um, what an honor uh to be here. It's

2
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:22,320
such exciting uh discussions and um I'm

3
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:24,000
humbled uh to to come from here in East

4
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,079
Hawaii Island, very rural uh

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,240
communities. I wanted to I think a lot

6
00:00:26,079 --> 00:00:30,159
about uh human behavior. Again, my name

7
00:00:28,239 --> 00:00:32,000
is Scott Larson. and I'm a climate uh

8
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,920
adaptation extension specialist with

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,079
PyASK and I have been for a little over

10
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,359
10 years and and and thinking about

11
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:39,039
human behavior and we've talked a little

12
00:00:37,359 --> 00:00:40,878
bit about that already in the previous

13
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:42,719
discussions you'll see some linkages and

14
00:00:40,878 --> 00:00:45,519
so I thought one way to to share that is

15
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:47,679
to talk about my behavior and uh one of

16
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:50,719
the uh the core to my professional path

17
00:00:47,679 --> 00:00:53,280
has always been to be regularly immersed

18
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:56,320
in the natural world and um equal to

19
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:58,320
that has been to develop and and and um

20
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:02,238
foster genuine connection or meaningful

21
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:05,198
relationship ships and in doing that um

22
00:01:02,238 --> 00:01:07,118
essentially I I really had focused on um

23
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:08,798
sustenance and when I say that I mean in

24
00:01:07,118 --> 00:01:11,040
in remote locations and and deeply

25
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:12,640
connected to the natural world

26
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,560
connecting to our food, water, shelter

27
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:18,000
basics. Obviously that's heavily linked

28
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:19,519
ancestrally as well to to u health and

29
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,680
I'm going to really center on well-being

30
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:25,039
a little bit more. Uh but in doing that

31
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:27,118
I'm going to share um sort of North

32
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:29,040
America and my experience and research

33
00:01:27,118 --> 00:01:30,959
and and leading outdoor expeditions

34
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:34,880
outdoor expeditions there and then

35
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:37,039
transition to um where I am now in in

36
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:39,759
middle of the Pacific Ocean and share

37
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:42,320
that transition again in a sense of of

38
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:46,000
human behavior and and um it's not at

39
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:48,319
all to diminish to to to to cue into

40
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,118
Sharon's talk. and you remember acutely

41
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:53,679
when you tear your ACL. Um, in remote

42
00:01:51,118 --> 00:01:55,680
places, you value emergency rooms and

43
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,640
access to them and and hospital visits

44
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,880
and those things, but I'm really

45
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,879
focusing on well-being that transcends

46
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:02,718
some of that. Um, it doesn't mean it's

47
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:04,879
more important. It's just the sense of

48
00:02:02,718 --> 00:02:07,199
well-being and um, and I'll get into

49
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:10,318
that next as far as connection and

50
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:12,239
relationships. And so, this is a biscom

51
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:14,958
pine in the upper left from uh, the

52
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:17,120
middle of Colorado. It's a it's a it's

53
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:19,598
an individual that I began to learn very

54
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:21,200
well its stories um through

55
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:22,959
dendrochronology and other other work

56
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:25,519
that I had done in this very remote area

57
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:27,520
at Treeline. Uh looking into the changes

58
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:30,159
in its stories or the way it tells its

59
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:33,200
story of change over more than 1200

60
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:34,878
years. Um this this this species this

61
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:37,439
individual has been alive and it put me

62
00:02:34,878 --> 00:02:39,759
in a place of understanding my place how

63
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:41,598
small it is and how for me that's where

64
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:43,479
I felt most alive. So getting back to

65
00:02:41,598 --> 00:02:45,598
that connection to nature and

66
00:02:43,479 --> 00:02:47,119
sustenance, I followed it in a human

67
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:48,639
behavior way because it's where I felt

68
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,959
most alive and I'm doing that to this

69
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:52,399
day. And the bottom right um I should

70
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:54,560
say the linkage from the left to the

71
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,560
right is that's one of the best mentors

72
00:02:54,560 --> 00:03:00,000
I've ever had. It's a black lab mut

73
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:01,360
again linking to Sharon's talk is um and

74
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
also the greatest hunter I've ever

75
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,920
known. And so the bottom right is my

76
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,680
work. The upper right was re researching

77
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:09,598
white pines in the Rockies and then the

78
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:12,640
bottom right is in northwest Wyoming

79
00:03:09,598 --> 00:03:15,280
researching wolves. And um the linkage

80
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:17,199
there is it really was compelling to for

81
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:20,239
me to understand wolves better through

82
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:22,799
my dog, this this great friend of mine

83
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:25,280
and then vice versa. and particularly in

84
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,959
the sense of sustenance of food and

85
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:29,199
hunting and watching and being

86
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:31,519
particularly in the winter with wolves

87
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:33,280
uh trained me much more deeply and truly

88
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:35,840
to connect to place sure but

89
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:38,080
pragmatically to find food successfully.

90
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:40,719
And so um this is David Abram wrote a

91
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:42,879
book that was really powerful in 1996

92
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:45,280
called the um spell of the sensuous and

93
00:03:42,878 --> 00:03:47,919
it really was a gamecher in literature

94
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,840
of um essentially he's saying we are

95
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:51,759
only human in as much as we are

96
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:54,000
connected to more than human. In other

97
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:56,158
words, if we're not connected to nature

98
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,759
we're missing our capacity uh in a

99
00:03:56,158 --> 00:04:00,560
psyche sense the development of our

100
00:03:57,759 --> 00:04:03,120
psyche. And so um going further at that

101
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:05,519
time, this is again all the about 2000s

102
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,039
um in in northwest Wyoming. And you

103
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:09,680
know, at the same time, I was I was

104
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:12,158
engaging outdoor education as research

105
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:13,599
in leading short um week-long small

106
00:04:12,158 --> 00:04:15,759
group expeditions, but I was also

107
00:04:13,598 --> 00:04:17,199
hunting and using my botanical skills

108
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:19,358
with a friend of mine, a non-blood

109
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:22,400
brother named Kevin. And we'd go up into

110
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:24,478
say 9 10,000 ft uh applying our

111
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:26,079
knowledge of ecosystems. And we start in

112
00:04:24,478 --> 00:04:28,000
the low areas, you know, digging

113
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:30,159
Yampampaoot going up to a range of

114
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,839
berries up elevation in the fall and

115
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:34,960
then we transition to small game hunting

116
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:37,679
and and um deer and and we wouldn't we'd

117
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:39,758
stay out there uh in the sense of not

118
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,759
having refrigeration, not some we're not

119
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:44,319
packing out anything. We're preserving

120
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:46,240
the food in place. And that's Doug Doug

121
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:48,719
fur tea I'm drinking in the upper left.

122
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,720
And the idea here is is this is bear

123
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,560
country. So, it's a certain heightened

124
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,639
awareness in Northwest Wyoming when you

125
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,639
are doing these kinds of things. And um

126
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:59,199
I found that not only was I most alive

127
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:01,280
in these situations, I I saw my own

128
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:03,840
horizons much better in a way of

129
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:06,000
pursuing my professional development of

130
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:08,159
connection to place. And so, Whoops. I

131
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,800
think I Yeah. Whoops. Oh, so moving

132
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:13,840
north in Alaska, uh again the mid 2000s

133
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:15,840
by this point and late 2000s. Um it's

134
00:05:13,839 --> 00:05:18,079
the relationships across the operators

135
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:20,000
in these week-long, in this case was two

136
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:22,000
week long expeditions across global

137
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
cultures. It was World Wildlife Funds

138
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,079
send their clientele across all kinds of

139
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,918
cultures and we would link up in these

140
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:30,319
small groups of say six to 10 people

141
00:05:27,918 --> 00:05:33,359
that we build a team and that team was

142
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:35,918
embedded deeply within boat captains,

143
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:37,919
float planes. Um, and establishing trust

144
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:40,399
there is fundamental because when things

145
00:05:37,918 --> 00:05:41,918
go south and they will, you got to be

146
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:44,159
ready and you have to have open

147
00:05:41,918 --> 00:05:46,159
communication. And I don't mean just

148
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:48,840
with the human components. And so this

149
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:51,680
is a fascinating way to engage human

150
00:05:48,839 --> 00:05:53,519
behavior at at more of an extreme as

151
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:56,160
you're furthering north in North America

152
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:57,758
and latitudes. Um, and at the same time,

153
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,639
the species that I was used to in in

154
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:02,080
northwest Wyoming were vastly different

155
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:03,600
and the same. They're the same species,

156
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:05,038
right? The coastal grizzly, the coastal

157
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,280
brown bear versus the grizzlies of

158
00:06:05,038 --> 00:06:09,279
Yellowstone, but they function totally

159
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:11,038
differently. And if I'm an omnivore and

160
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:13,279
I'm thinking of sustenance, that's an

161
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:14,879
omnivore. and most everything they eat

162
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:16,559
seasonally, even though it's very

163
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:18,800
different from the the interior bears of

164
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:21,519
Alaska or the grizzlies in Yellowstone,

165
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:24,478
I can eat mostly what they can. It's an

166
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:27,038
amazing connection to to reconnect to in

167
00:06:24,478 --> 00:06:29,758
these ways across species in different

168
00:06:27,038 --> 00:06:32,360
uh ecosystems. But again, the human

169
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:34,560
element is where I found myself most

170
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:36,080
situated. And working with people that

171
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:39,038
generationally have been engaged in

172
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:42,000
these areas was amazing. That's a a very

173
00:06:39,038 --> 00:06:43,519
rugged uh cabin of a very rugged woman

174
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,680
connected to place. It's Jod and Lucas

175
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:47,758
from the early 1900s. That's Kevin and I

176
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:49,759
again uh with some of the the clothes

177
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:51,840
that we tanned from their hunting

178
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:53,600
endeavors. But that's Peter and Mary,

179
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:56,159
good friends of mine from Rankin Inlet

180
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:58,479
on Hudson Bay. Um and that's Peter in

181
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:00,639
the right doing a drum dance while Mary

182
00:06:58,478 --> 00:07:03,199
is chanting. And we're in a small

183
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:07,439
structure built of essentially bearded

184
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:09,840
seal seal skin hut. and uh amazing to

185
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:11,680
see much more deeply not only into

186
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:15,119
generational connection to place and

187
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:17,680
survival well-being etc and adaptation

188
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:20,079
but therein to find myself more deeply

189
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:22,160
and so as I go further north again the

190
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:26,000
bear ecology totally changes with polar

191
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:28,000
bears it's vast open expanses and these

192
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,519
bears unlike brown bears and black bears

193
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,959
that are gone within nine out of 10en

194
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:33,038
times before you even know they're you

195
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:35,680
are in their area these bears will come

196
00:07:33,038 --> 00:07:38,318
right to you and It's it's also

197
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,840
extremely remote as far as resources. So

198
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:42,160
you need each other, you need these

199
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:44,079
relationships in place where you don't

200
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:47,199
have like aabaskan interior culture, say

201
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:50,000
in Alaska or across Canada, um all kinds

202
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:52,800
of wood and lots of resources. It's it's

203
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,120
driftwood here and except in the ocean.

204
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:57,439
And the the point is uh change is

205
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:59,759
paramount and as the the communities

206
00:07:57,439 --> 00:08:02,160
change the the more than human so the

207
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:03,919
the human and the Dorset culture. Sorry,

208
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,759
we're missing one. Oh, there it is. The

209
00:08:03,918 --> 00:08:08,159
Dorset culture uh was one that was used

210
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:10,080
to heavy ice and they would hunt and

211
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:12,000
fish from the ice hand lining

212
00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:14,159
essentially two-tonon or one ton

213
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,160
animals, marine mammals, and that was

214
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:18,400
massive. And they were around for 1500

215
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:20,639
stable years and then the climate shifts

216
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:23,359
around 500 AD, the medieval warming era,

217
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:26,079
and you get a very quick transition to

218
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:27,759
the Tuli people. Um, and I leave those

219
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:30,478
upper left amulets indicating that

220
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:32,399
throughout that that era, the Tuli being

221
00:08:30,478 --> 00:08:35,278
the predecessor of sort of Inuit,

222
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:37,360
Upupic, Inupia, uh, and certainly uh,

223
00:08:35,278 --> 00:08:39,120
all across coastal communities. But that

224
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:41,120
deep connection, those are amulets that

225
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:43,759
are Dorset amulets that are maybe an

226
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:45,200
inch or two hyper accurate skull

227
00:08:43,759 --> 00:08:47,120
structures of polar bears. And then

228
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:49,680
there's more stylized. They're really

229
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:52,399
getting at spiritual realms and and and

230
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:54,079
more swimming behaviors and and just a

231
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:55,919
fascinating connection. And by the time

232
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:58,839
the tulie take over, they're using open

233
00:08:55,919 --> 00:09:02,479
ocean crafts to

234
00:08:58,839 --> 00:09:05,839
harness right whales or um and and these

235
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:07,920
whales are so massive um that that

236
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:10,800
stabilizes the seasonality of of the

237
00:09:07,919 --> 00:09:12,958
tuli culture um and and from again a

238
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:15,039
sustenance standpoint. Uh but I need to

239
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:17,039
quick go through there we go that all

240
00:09:15,039 --> 00:09:20,079
those relationships by the time I'm in

241
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:23,360
Hawaii in 2010 I realized very quickly

242
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:25,360
that information data is not knowledge

243
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:28,240
um not very quickly I mean over that

244
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:30,320
time I came to Hawaii understanding that

245
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:32,879
information is is not knowledge nor do

246
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,720
we become any more knowledgeable through

247
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:37,439
information accumulation. it

248
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:39,920
knowledgeability rather sits is situated

249
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:42,000
in uh that information within the

250
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:43,519
context of direct perceptual engagements

251
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,360
with our environment. In other words,

252
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:48,320
experience. And this is a quote from Tim

253
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:50,080
Engold, one of the paramount um folks in

254
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:53,120
establishing environmental anthropology

255
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:55,600
as a as a new um discipline currently

256
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:57,519
since basically from the 80s to now. And

257
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,759
um you know through that time so if if

258
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:00,959
information is not knowledge, well what

259
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:02,720
is knowledge? Well, we just talked about

260
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:04,799
that as situated information through

261
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,560
experience. And then how come with all

262
00:10:04,799 --> 00:10:08,639
the decades of applied science and

263
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:10,399
climate science have we not seen more

264
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:12,799
human behavior change? Well,

265
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:14,720
psychologists, cognitive e uh biologists

266
00:10:12,799 --> 00:10:16,479
and certainly um a range of social

267
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:19,519
sciences have said, well, if you want to

268
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:21,600
engage behavior, engage affect emotion.

269
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:23,679
Um and what they're getting at is the

270
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:25,680
the type one and two knowledge forms or

271
00:10:23,679 --> 00:10:27,759
knowledge systems. Type one is visceral,

272
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:30,479
quick acting, very impactual instinct,

273
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:31,679
intuition, emotion, uh unconscious.

274
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,360
Again, thinking about hunting and

275
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:35,599
fishing, that kind of thing. Uh

276
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:37,839
gardening as well. Um and the system two

277
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:40,480
is that long-term slower to react

278
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:42,000
reason, logic, analysis, etc. And it's

279
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,839
not saying one is better than the other,

280
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,240
but it is saying most of the research

281
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:48,399
suggests if these two diverge in one

282
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:50,480
person, the visceral knowledge forms are

283
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:52,958
going to dominate behavior. But the

284
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:54,639
point is we need them both. And it

285
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:57,039
really is not thinking of climate change

286
00:10:54,639 --> 00:10:59,919
as some distant future or vast geography

287
00:10:57,039 --> 00:11:01,519
and objectivity. It's really shifting uh

288
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:03,120
social sciences have made clear we need

289
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:05,919
to think about climate change as deeply

290
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:09,278
personal, deeply local and deeply uh

291
00:11:05,919 --> 00:11:11,838
present in this moment. And so with that

292
00:11:09,278 --> 00:11:14,159
in 2015, I had developed uh with a

293
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:16,800
number of uh leaders co-developed the

294
00:11:14,159 --> 00:11:18,319
the the manager climate corps which is a

295
00:11:16,799 --> 00:11:20,958
research program for graduate students

296
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:22,720
where they get two-year immersions into

297
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:24,559
community. And what I mean by community

298
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,480
is I had worked hard to find the

299
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:28,639
long-term relationships connected to

300
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:32,720
place in East Hawaii uh and Hawaii

301
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:34,559
Island. Um and that is people who uh

302
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,480
cultural practitioners, heritage uh

303
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:38,319
managers, uh natural resource managers,

304
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,600
policy professionals who are deeply

305
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:42,079
connected to not only the more than

306
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,759
human place but also the communities of

307
00:11:42,078 --> 00:11:45,519
humans that utilize and engage that

308
00:11:43,759 --> 00:11:47,759
area. And so when I show these

309
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:49,679
foundational elements, hopefully they

310
00:11:47,759 --> 00:11:52,078
they of of the manager climate core

311
00:11:49,679 --> 00:11:54,000
program, um hopefully they make sense a

312
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:55,919
little bit more and I don't really need

313
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,480
to go through them as you think about

314
00:11:55,919 --> 00:12:00,240
the slides I've shared in my path, but

315
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:02,720
uh we've had 20 grad students go through

316
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:05,440
this over five cohorts and it's been a

317
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:07,920
hugely engaging way to drop graduate

318
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:10,320
students into long-term relationships

319
00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:12,159
through practitioners of place. Um and

320
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:14,320
then before I have a little time um I

321
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:15,919
can I want to there you'll see in the

322
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:17,360
website that we're linked that that

323
00:12:15,919 --> 00:12:19,439
those websites will show you about the

324
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:21,600
manager climate corps in detail but I'm

325
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:23,120
going to shift those same foundations of

326
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:26,720
that program that's been going on for

327
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:28,480
the last 10 year or yeah 10 years um and

328
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:30,800
show those same foundations applied in

329
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:34,720
new ways into new locations and this is

330
00:12:30,799 --> 00:12:36,399
Kakua on the west Hawaii island is uh

331
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,120
known more so globally now as one of

332
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:40,720
those top coral reef snorkel

333
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:43,839
environments Very few of those folks

334
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:45,920
engaging the reef understand the huge

335
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:47,760
power of that area as far as the native

336
00:12:45,919 --> 00:12:50,719
Hawaiian history and contemporary

337
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:52,439
culture and that's hika from the late

338
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:55,839
18th century in the in the artist

339
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:58,240
rendition practice there in in that ha

340
00:12:55,839 --> 00:13:00,000
or or sacred place sacred structure has

341
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:02,159
been traditional practice has gone on

342
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:05,039
from then to the present moment without

343
00:13:02,159 --> 00:13:07,120
interruption. Um, so if you think about

344
00:13:05,039 --> 00:13:08,719
sustenance, connection to food, water,

345
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:11,200
shelter, particularly within more than

346
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:12,800
human, what a great place to consider.

347
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,879
And so the community action plan that

348
00:13:12,799 --> 00:13:16,958
was developed was driven by traditional

349
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:19,838
that community itself. And it was

350
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:22,799
embedded into the state parks top down

351
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:24,560
kind of more conventional plan um to

352
00:13:22,799 --> 00:13:26,799
really join those two to have at the

353
00:13:24,559 --> 00:13:29,199
same time a community-driven plan united

354
00:13:26,799 --> 00:13:31,679
with a a state parks plan. the first

355
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:33,759
kind of that sort that has has been

356
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:35,838
established in in Hawaii, the state of

357
00:13:33,759 --> 00:13:38,480
Hawaii. And um importantly,

358
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:40,079
relationality or kinship modalities is

359
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:43,120
the only crosscutting theme of that

360
00:13:40,078 --> 00:13:45,278
community action plan. Um and that so

361
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:48,320
another way to think of it is the goal

362
00:13:45,278 --> 00:13:49,759
here is to root the practices in heia

363
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:52,000
that have again as far as relationality

364
00:13:49,759 --> 00:13:54,000
or kinship have been uh handed down for

365
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:57,120
generations and root them much more

366
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:59,120
deeply in um in all the surrounding

367
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:01,440
activities whether that's tourism

368
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,959
experience industries uh certainly

369
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,800
research that has largely been

370
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:07,599
parachuted in and not really engaging

371
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:10,078
the community. shifting all as as we can

372
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:12,000
patiently slowly to engage heritage

373
00:14:10,078 --> 00:14:14,239
management to engage natural resource

374
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:17,360
management through those very specific

375
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:19,120
practices in that area. Um and that's a

376
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:21,039
new five-year program that's being

377
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:23,278
developed uh currently. We're in our

378
00:14:21,039 --> 00:14:26,958
first year with that um partnering with

379
00:14:23,278 --> 00:14:29,439
Cornell for that uh from uh and so as an

380
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:30,958
example of a practice what in in the

381
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:32,639
area and of course Pacificwide and

382
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:36,159
actually globally this is a this

383
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:38,240
outrigger canoe paddling is a powerful

384
00:14:36,159 --> 00:14:40,319
way to demonstrate this is an sort of an

385
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,560
introduction to outrigger canoe paddling

386
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:44,560
what has been handed down for

387
00:14:41,559 --> 00:14:47,838
generations to obtain sustenance to to

388
00:14:44,559 --> 00:14:51,039
survive whether it's fishing hunting uh

389
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:53,199
adaptation as far as war transportation

390
00:14:51,039 --> 00:14:55,919
These are basics that have come down

391
00:14:53,198 --> 00:14:58,639
through generations. Um and and and

392
00:14:55,919 --> 00:15:00,000
really many spatial scales and temporal

393
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:01,759
scales are engaged here. Whether you're

394
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,360
talking about ground swells impacting

395
00:15:01,759 --> 00:15:05,919
the canoe, how to navigate that at the

396
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:08,240
same time as wind chop. And then if we

397
00:15:05,919 --> 00:15:10,240
take that notion of practice to a

398
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:12,000
broader scale, back to that manager

399
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,519
climate core. Again, those are two-year

400
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,240
research projects that graduate students

401
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:18,560
were driving. Well, what if each of the

402
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:20,399
islands here are stages or research

403
00:15:18,559 --> 00:15:22,719
projects? So like the first five there

404
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:23,839
that are darker, those could be each a

405
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:26,720
research project. And if you're

406
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:29,519
maintaining the relationships as as sort

407
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:32,079
of embodied in in the canoe itself and

408
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:33,839
and the navigators within the canoe. Um

409
00:15:32,078 --> 00:15:35,919
that final island, the sixth island is

410
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:38,920
where you engage for example through

411
00:15:35,919 --> 00:15:42,719
Kellua Bay, the community action plan I

412
00:15:38,919 --> 00:15:45,519
shared, deep kinship connection and

413
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:47,759
therein the capacity for gaining local

414
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:50,799
sustenance, food, water, shelter, but

415
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:54,319
also a way to adapt that's been intact

416
00:15:50,799 --> 00:15:56,639
for centuries. Um, and if if if we don't

417
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:58,879
consider th those those tremendous

418
00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:01,039
capacities just in the human condition,

419
00:15:58,879 --> 00:16:03,439
we're missing a lot of what it is to not

420
00:16:01,039 --> 00:16:06,159
only adapt, but actually to find our

421
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:08,880
deeper sense of self, our well-being,

422
00:16:06,159 --> 00:16:10,639
and certainly um health as far as our

423
00:16:08,879 --> 00:16:12,958
ability to survive. So, thanks very much

424
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:17,839
for your time. And that's what I got.

425
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:20,958
I'm just curious u and Sharon uh hop on

426
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:24,759
when you're ready for your concluding

427
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:30,278
statements, but I'm just curious, Scott,

428
00:16:24,759 --> 00:16:32,519
uh you're you're you're taking in this

429
00:16:30,278 --> 00:16:36,000
relationality.

430
00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:38,159
Um it's a very organic relationality and

431
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,480
one that I personally can understand or

432
00:16:38,159 --> 00:16:43,198
relate to. But we are entering into this

433
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:44,800
incredible abstract moment of artificial

434
00:16:43,198 --> 00:16:49,198
intelligence

435
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:51,758
um which is still you know two degrees

436
00:16:49,198 --> 00:16:55,039
of separation from whoever generated the

437
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:58,039
basis for which the AI is going at. But

438
00:16:55,039 --> 00:17:01,799
um how are you thinking about

439
00:16:58,039 --> 00:17:04,918
incorporating or or

440
00:17:01,799 --> 00:17:08,318
informing that

441
00:17:04,919 --> 00:17:11,480
trajectory in that direction? Right? How

442
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:15,480
how how are we going to sort of

443
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:20,120
integrate this massive ecosystem

444
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:23,568
thinking, corporeal thinking with these

445
00:17:20,119 --> 00:17:24,759
databased AI based

446
00:17:23,568 --> 00:17:28,000
[Music]

447
00:17:24,759 --> 00:17:29,359
um formulas for understanding the bigger

448
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,359
picture, right? They're two different

449
00:17:29,359 --> 00:17:35,439
ways. And I'm just curious how you're

450
00:17:31,359 --> 00:17:37,439
thinking about how we can

451
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:38,720
I tried to give an example of how I

452
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:40,160
didn't mention too much of the research

453
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:42,160
I'm involved with and have been for

454
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,919
decades that I didn't focus on that as

455
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:45,440
much

456
00:17:42,919 --> 00:17:47,120
as engaging that research and and

457
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:49,120
largely in place. And so that's one of

458
00:17:47,119 --> 00:17:50,519
the things I'd say is, you know, I'm

459
00:17:49,119 --> 00:17:52,558
talking about remote wilderness

460
00:17:50,519 --> 00:17:55,359
experience, sustenance, and building

461
00:17:52,558 --> 00:17:57,678
shelter in that way. But no less is this

462
00:17:55,359 --> 00:17:59,359
applied with with local sustenance in a

463
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:01,120
garden at a backyard garden or a front

464
00:17:59,359 --> 00:18:02,879
yard garden. And the more that we're in

465
00:18:01,119 --> 00:18:05,359
it engaging the senses like in the sense

466
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:07,840
of I mentioned with um David Abrams

467
00:18:05,359 --> 00:18:10,079
spell of the sensuous that's just as

468
00:18:07,839 --> 00:18:12,159
paramount and particularly when global

469
00:18:10,079 --> 00:18:13,599
supply chains are in question and and

470
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:15,840
we're talking about massively

471
00:18:13,599 --> 00:18:19,359
unsustainable connectivity globally in

472
00:18:15,839 --> 00:18:21,918
relation to to to carbon uh budgets and

473
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:24,000
it's it's unnatural to maintain those

474
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:26,320
pathways to connect to place more and

475
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,679
more. Um, that doesn't mean, you know,

476
00:18:26,319 --> 00:18:30,720
that I know where this shirt was made

477
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:32,960
from, but I try to make clothing to to

478
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:35,038
grow food or to wild harvest food. And

479
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:36,798
the more that we're doing that, David

480
00:18:35,038 --> 00:18:38,960
Abram would suggest that the more we're

481
00:18:36,798 --> 00:18:42,000
capable of finding our own well-being,

482
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:43,519
our own sense of self instinctively um

483
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,200
that's been handed down for for

484
00:18:43,519 --> 00:18:46,720
centuries to all cultures, to all

485
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,080
people. And that's kind of what I've

486
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:50,640
been on the path of and that's what I'd

487
00:18:48,079 --> 00:18:52,480
sort of answer with is just say that

488
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:54,400
doesn't with all the things going on

489
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:57,360
none of that negates the need to connect

490
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:59,919
to place. In fact, it only emphasizes it

491
00:18:57,359 --> 00:19:02,639
in my ru my zone and it doesn't suggest

492
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:06,880
that we shouldn't uh consider these

493
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:08,400
these large technologies. Um but as as

494
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,840
Sharon presented there are costs to a

495
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,280
lot of these whether it's AI she

496
00:19:09,839 --> 00:19:15,038
mentioned some of the cooling that's

497
00:19:11,279 --> 00:19:17,599
needed. Um the we need to think of all

498
00:19:15,038 --> 00:19:19,119
the spectrum of impacts in in plus and

499
00:19:17,599 --> 00:19:21,678
minus ways specifically towards

500
00:19:19,119 --> 00:19:24,000
sustainability of all species, not just

501
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:27,120
our own. And the more we consider that,

502
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:31,519
the less we're not centered on humans,

503
00:19:27,119 --> 00:19:31,519
the more I found that we'll become truly

504
00:19:34,519 --> 00:19:40,160
human. This has been a production of

505
00:19:37,279 --> 00:19:44,038
Cornell University on the web at

506
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:44,038
