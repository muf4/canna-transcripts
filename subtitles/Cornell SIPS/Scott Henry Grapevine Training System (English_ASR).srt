1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:05,040
this is a production of cornell

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:05,040
university

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,240
this is the scott henry training system

4
00:00:12,638 --> 00:00:15,359
and we've probably talked about this in

5
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:17,039
class

6
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:18,879
it's what we call a dynamic training

7
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:21,520
system which means we have to do an

8
00:00:18,879 --> 00:00:24,879
adjustment during the growing season

9
00:00:21,519 --> 00:00:26,960
so we've got uh four chains one two

10
00:00:24,879 --> 00:00:27,759
three four

11
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:31,118
and

12
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:33,039
what we do is we position the lower tier

13
00:00:31,118 --> 00:00:35,119
downwards so when we looked at the

14
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:36,960
double geo we've got four killings but

15
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:39,759
everything grows up and the scott

16
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,520
henry's system the top grows up and you

17
00:00:39,759 --> 00:00:43,039
can actually see this is what a machine

18
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,719
harvested

19
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:47,759
or mechanically harvested block looks

20
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:49,679
like so you can see what's left here uh

21
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:51,439
in terms of where the fruit was

22
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:52,238
so we had a fruiting zone up at the top

23
00:00:51,439 --> 00:00:54,320
here

24
00:00:52,238 --> 00:00:56,959
then we have a bit of a space and then

25
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,960
we have a lower fruiting zone here

26
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,239
and these shoots are actually positioned

27
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,160
downwards

28
00:01:00,238 --> 00:01:03,119
so that we come along just after berry

29
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:05,280
set

30
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:07,519
and flip this wire downwards so they're

31
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,879
growing up then we flip it down and pull

32
00:01:07,519 --> 00:01:10,879
the shoots down

33
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:12,879
as a result the growth along the bottom

34
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:15,679
isn't always very good

35
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:17,920
but it gives us this space here in the

36
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:20,320
training system that allows for more

37
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,680
light and more airflow

38
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:24,239
so this is something growers don't

39
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:26,799
always like it's extra work but the

40
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:29,199
studies that have been done usually show

41
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:30,799
that this can improve yield while either

42
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,118
maintaining or improving fruit

43
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:36,320
composition so it's a really good system

44
00:01:33,118 --> 00:01:37,920
that many growers need to consider using

45
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:41,438
so i'm going to prune this scott henry

46
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:43,040
system and get us down to four canes two

47
00:01:41,438 --> 00:01:45,438
that go out here

48
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:47,600
and two that grow out here

49
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:50,000
so i was just looking at this uh to

50
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:53,199
figure out what i was going to use and

51
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,879
remember i don't want to use bull wood

52
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,680
so bullwood is something that's built in

53
00:01:54,879 --> 00:02:00,239
diameter it has long spaces or long

54
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:02,880
internodes uh between the buds

55
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:03,759
and so i looked at at this shoot right

56
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:06,560
here

57
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:08,800
and i thought oh that's bullwood i'm not

58
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:10,878
going to use that so i thought okay

59
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:13,840
where am i going to cut this out and i

60
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:15,759
went to look and then i realized hold on

61
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,680
it's not from this vine

62
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:20,159
it comes up as if it is let's pull this

63
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:23,840
out because

64
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:23,840
it's crazy long

65
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,719
okay

66
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:31,839
so this is how long it is and it's not

67
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:31,840
even from this vine

68
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:39,280
and it's not from the neighboring vine

69
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:42,239
it actually comes from two vines over

70
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:45,519
so this is an absolutely crazy amount of

71
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:48,480
bull wood i mean this has got to be

72
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:50,400
15 feet or something like that

73
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:51,679
this is what you do not want to see

74
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,599
in your vineyard

75
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,760
so i'm getting rid of that

76
00:02:53,598 --> 00:02:58,479
okay so i'm going to cut away some of

77
00:02:55,759 --> 00:03:01,439
the extra stuff so that we can figure

78
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:03,598
out exactly what we're going to use here

79
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:04,959
so we'll start with the lower tier first

80
00:03:03,598 --> 00:03:06,959
and remember

81
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:09,759
we want to keep everything close to the

82
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:11,680
head so that we don't get a a space

83
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:13,598
where we're not going to have fruit

84
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,680
production

85
00:03:13,598 --> 00:03:18,079
so i've got a can here that's kind of

86
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,920
gray at the bottom so i think that's

87
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:23,040
probably not going to be very good so

88
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:26,399
that's really not a good option for me

89
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:30,840
these ones here are too far out

90
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,840
so we'll cut those right out of there

91
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:37,598
uh and that leaves this one here

92
00:03:35,598 --> 00:03:40,479
it's a little bit gray so i'm gonna see

93
00:03:37,598 --> 00:03:42,238
what else we have for the bottom tier

94
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:44,158
that's too low

95
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:46,560
not useful

96
00:03:44,158 --> 00:03:48,959
that would be a possibility but it's a

97
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:51,680
little bit big with long internodes so

98
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:53,519
i'm not going to use that either

99
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:57,000
so to simplify here we're going to cut

100
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:57,000
this out too

101
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:07,039
so looking at what we have

102
00:04:04,878 --> 00:04:09,280
here i'm actually seeing

103
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:12,079
a possibility for a cane that could go

104
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,080
along this wire

105
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:17,120
so if i stretch this one out i've got

106
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:18,720
all of these buttons along here that are

107
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:21,040
going to produce shoots

108
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,479
whereas if i use this one i'm going to

109
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,840
have this space here that doesn't have

110
00:04:22,478 --> 00:04:26,000
any shoots

111
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:26,839
so i think i'll use this claim to go in

112
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,759
this

113
00:04:26,839 --> 00:04:34,799
direction and then along this side

114
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:36,400
this one doesn't look too bad i'd like

115
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,478
it to be a little more brown it's a

116
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:41,198
little gray through there

117
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:42,639
but it might be my best bet for laying

118
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:44,240
out in that direction

119
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:47,120
so i'm going to use these two canes so

120
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,120
i'll get rid of this

121
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,199
cut this out of the way

122
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:58,160
and that's going to be my first clean

123
00:04:55,918 --> 00:05:00,000
along here

124
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:02,400
so i'll wrap it for now we'd come back

125
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
with these cane ties that we use and

126
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:05,120
actually tie these into place a little

127
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,959
bit later

128
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:10,240
in the spring

129
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:11,359
so for uh here i think i'm gonna use

130
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,439
this cane

131
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:16,639
it's a little gray towards the end but

132
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:18,399
uh we're running into this vine anyway

133
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:20,000
so then what i can do

134
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:21,198
is get rid of this whole thing through

135
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,199
here

136
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:25,680
because i'm not gonna use anything that

137
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:28,639
comes from it so

138
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,639
i'm going to cut this out

139
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:33,840
and i think i'll cut it right down it

140
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:36,720
actually it looks like it's a root

141
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:38,879
sucker anyway because here is our graft

142
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,960
union here's the bulge

143
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:42,319
and it's actually not coming from the

144
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:43,839
graft union

145
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:45,918
so this is a mistake someone should

146
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:47,679
never have tied this one up anyway

147
00:05:45,918 --> 00:05:49,599
because

148
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:52,400
it could be root stock material rather

149
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,600
than than fruit and uh fruiting wood or

150
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:54,319
cyan would

151
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,600
so

152
00:05:54,319 --> 00:06:01,199
we've got a kind that goes this way

153
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,199
cut some of this extra stuff out

154
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:05,600
and a plane that ties out in this

155
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,840
direction here let me get rid of our old

156
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,840
one

157
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,960
this comes from the neighboring vine i'm

158
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,720
going to cut that back

159
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:16,159
so

160
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,319
that comes from the neighboring vine as

161
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,319
well

162
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:23,439
so there's our two cones

163
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:25,439
for our lower tier

164
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:27,839
upper tier uh it looks like we've got a

165
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:31,680
little bit more choice here

166
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:34,159
either of these two shoots right here

167
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:36,319
are probably a possibility this one

168
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:38,319
might lay out there as well

169
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:40,560
so i'll cut the rest of this older clean

170
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:40,560
off

171
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:45,959
to get it out of the way so i can see

172
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:45,960
what i've got

173
00:06:55,439 --> 00:06:57,759
so

174
00:06:57,839 --> 00:07:00,399
there we go so that's cleared out of the

175
00:06:59,439 --> 00:07:02,000
way

176
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:04,478
and along here i know i'm not going to

177
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,918
use anything past this one

178
00:07:04,478 --> 00:07:07,918
so i'll get that out of the way as well

179
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:14,598
and it's tied in there pretty good with

180
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:14,598
a cane tie that i'm going to pull off

181
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:27,840
there's a lot of vigor in this block

182
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:30,478
which is why we have some overlap from

183
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:34,478
neighboring uh vines here because we

184
00:07:30,478 --> 00:07:37,199
needed more space to lay out more buds

185
00:07:34,478 --> 00:07:37,199
cut this out

186
00:07:41,918 --> 00:07:45,038
so this allows me to look at what's

187
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:47,519
really good here

188
00:07:45,038 --> 00:07:50,399
uh this is nice nice brown wood but it's

189
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:52,000
just too big in diameter definitely some

190
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:53,918
bull wood there

191
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,319
that's pretty useless so we'll cut that

192
00:07:53,918 --> 00:07:57,318
right out of there

193
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:03,360
uh i just damaged that chain a little

194
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:05,598
bit as i pulled the other piece out so

195
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:08,160
it's probably still gonna be okay so

196
00:08:05,598 --> 00:08:10,399
that's a good option still

197
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:13,280
that is probably an even better option

198
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:15,519
it's a little bit smaller in diameter

199
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:17,198
and i don't have to worry about uh that

200
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:21,318
little piece of bark i just pulled off

201
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:21,319
so i'm going to keep that one

202
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:29,359
it's from the neighboring vine

203
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:33,279
as is this

204
00:08:35,278 --> 00:08:39,399
okay so this one

205
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,360
and i just hit myself in the face with a

206
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:46,080
cane

207
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:49,200
this one we're going to tie out this way

208
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,879
and then we've got this one here

209
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,320
it's got what we call a persistent

210
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:54,639
lateral on it so we're going to get rid

211
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:56,399
of that persistent lateral we can leave

212
00:08:54,639 --> 00:08:58,319
an extra bud there if we want to make

213
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:00,399
sure we get something in the space

214
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:02,640
although it's pretty long anyway so i'll

215
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:06,159
probably cut right about there

216
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:08,480
and that is how i would clean prune this

217
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:10,159
scott henry system so we'll come back

218
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,600
with some cane ties

219
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:14,240
tie those down

220
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:16,800
i've got my four cones i'll leave that

221
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,560
as a renewal spur and the vines done

222
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:21,559
ready to go once we tie it down for the

223
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:21,559
season

224
00:09:24,879 --> 00:09:32,519
this has been a production of cornell

225
00:09:27,278 --> 00:09:32,519
university on the web at cornell.edu
