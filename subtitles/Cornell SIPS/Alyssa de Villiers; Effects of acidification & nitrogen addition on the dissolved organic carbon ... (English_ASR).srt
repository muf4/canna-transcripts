00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:04,759
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:12,919
University um okay so my name is Alyssa

3
00:00:10,039 --> 00:00:16,320
dilers I'm a thirdy Year Ms PhD student

4
00:00:12,919 --> 00:00:17,800
in the lab of Dr Carmen aned Martinez

5
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,480
and I'm really excited to share my

6
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:22,519
research with you today I'm going to try

7
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,880
using this clicky thing and oh here we

8
00:00:22,518 --> 00:00:27,320
go so first I'd like to acknowledge my

lab group I'm in all the great members

16
00:00:41,878 --> 00:00:46,479
of it and particularly aned thank you so

17
00:00:44,119 --> 00:00:48,280
much um I've been lucky to receive

18
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:50,238
funding through the USDA for the first

19
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:53,799
two years of my program that has been

20
00:00:50,238 --> 00:00:55,519
really wonderful and I'm uh recently

21
00:00:53,799 --> 00:00:57,399
funded through the Cornell ainson Center

22
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:00,399
for sustainability graduate research

23
00:00:57,399 --> 00:01:00,399
Grant

24
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,838
so to give you a general idea of how I

25
00:01:02,518 --> 00:01:06,959
anticipate my degree going the first two

26
00:01:04,838 --> 00:01:09,560
chapters will be based on my Master's

27
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:12,000
project this involves acidification and

28
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:13,759
nitrogen addition in Forest soils and

29
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,040
looking at the effects on the water

30
00:01:13,759 --> 00:01:17,920
extractable fraction and then the next

31
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:20,079
two chapters that I'm proposing for my

32
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:22,960
dissertation will shift to look at

33
00:01:20,078 --> 00:01:25,639
cellulose decomposition and trying to

34
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:26,959
link enzymatic breakdown with this

35
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:30,519
technique that an need mentioned of

36
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:33,039
density functional Theory

37
00:01:30,519 --> 00:01:35,319
so diving right in to the Master's

38
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:37,479
project as I said this is looking at

39
00:01:35,319 --> 00:01:40,599
acidification and nitrogen addition in

40
00:01:37,478 --> 00:01:42,399
Forest soils and while our uh

41
00:01:40,599 --> 00:01:44,759
collaborators in the good lab group are

42
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:47,200
looking at ecosystem fluxes of carbon

43
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:48,718
and nitrogen and the bowly group is

44
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,880
looking at below ground carbon

45
00:01:48,718 --> 00:01:52,959
allocation and root exodites we're

46
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:55,798
focused on the soil solution or what

47
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:58,038
comes off of the soil into water in the

48
00:01:55,799 --> 00:02:00,759
soil and our hypothesis was that

49
00:01:58,039 --> 00:02:03,159
dissolved organic matter composition and

50
00:02:00,759 --> 00:02:05,359
then absorption to soil minerals to form

51
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:09,599
mineral Associated organic matter would

52
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:09,599
be altered by nitrogen addition and

53
00:02:09,719 --> 00:02:15,318
acidification this is an important issue

54
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,639
because as probably many of you know uh

55
00:02:15,318 --> 00:02:20,119
we've had acidification and nitrogen

56
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:24,318
addition going on for quite a long time

57
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:27,360
in um our soils so uh what we see on the

58
00:02:24,318 --> 00:02:29,159
right here is global sulfur emissions

59
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:32,160
and through the combustion of fossil

60
00:02:29,159 --> 00:02:34,359
fuels and particularly coal uh we had

61
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:36,560
started having an increase in the 1900s

62
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:38,239
and then what you see I think I can here

63
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,318
we go so what you here see here is

64
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:42,599
around 1950 we have a sharp

65
00:02:40,318 --> 00:02:45,238
acceleration and down here this is

66
00:02:42,598 --> 00:02:47,119
nitrogen and in black is atmospheric

67
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:49,640
nitrogen so this is nitrogen sources in

68
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:51,640
the Chesapeake Bay and you see that same

69
00:02:49,639 --> 00:02:54,199
pattern so in the 1950s we have a big

70
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:56,839
acceleration of atmospheric nitrogen and

71
00:02:54,199 --> 00:02:58,518
then we see it uh peaking around 1980

72
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:00,239
and so what happened then was uh

73
00:02:58,519 --> 00:03:02,840
essentially the Clean Air Act started

74
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:06,080
regulating um sulfur and nitrogen

75
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:08,080
emissions so on this picture what we see

76
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:10,159
is that uh through the combustion fossil

77
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:12,080
fuel sulfur dioxide nitrogen oxides are

78
00:03:10,158 --> 00:03:13,679
released to the atmosphere they can

79
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,400
travel and then through dri or wet

80
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:18,239
deposition they get distributed across

81
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:20,439
the landscape and that can cause

82
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:22,680
acidification it can cause nitrogen

83
00:03:20,439 --> 00:03:25,199
addition which itself can cause

84
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:27,319
acidification um and then also we might

85
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:31,280
have other sources of nitrogen addition

86
00:03:27,318 --> 00:03:33,958
like ammonia volatization or runoff

87
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:35,759
so as you can see in that graph uh we've

88
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:37,438
actually already peaked on those things

89
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:38,798
those regulations worked and they helped

90
00:03:37,438 --> 00:03:41,359
to bring it down and this only is

91
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:43,920
showing until 2000 in that top graph but

92
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:45,760
those numbers continue to fall so

93
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:47,158
actually what we're seeing now that's

94
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:48,919
more important than the effects of

95
00:03:47,158 --> 00:03:51,079
acidification is really what's going to

96
00:03:48,919 --> 00:03:53,958
happen as we recover from acidification

97
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:55,680
and recover from nitrogen addition um so

98
00:03:53,959 --> 00:03:58,400
we want to see what effects we have on

99
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:01,040
the soil from that and one of them that

100
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:03,400
can be happening is that more dissolved

101
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:05,519
organic matter can leave the soil and

102
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:07,879
that can cause Lake Browning where the

103
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:09,879
water is getting more organic matter and

104
00:04:07,878 --> 00:04:12,359
more color in it and then that in turn

105
00:04:09,878 --> 00:04:14,959
affects the Aquatic uh life in in

106
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:17,040
streams and lakes um also we are

107
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:18,879
thinking about soil Health in terms of

108
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,840
losing nutrients or retaining nutrients

109
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:22,439
and carbon in the soil and climate

110
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:24,279
change if we have more carbon combing

111
00:04:22,439 --> 00:04:26,160
off into the soils it's possible that

112
00:04:24,279 --> 00:04:28,039
microbes would be able to respire that

113
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,840
out as CO2 and we might lose that from

114
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:32,960
the system so that's sort of of frames

115
00:04:30,839 --> 00:04:35,679
uh what we're thinking about in this

116
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:37,359
project the setup we used to look at

117
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,000
this was actually pretty exciting

118
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:41,439
because it's been happening for over a

119
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,120
decade so before I was involved with the

120
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:44,639
project these were already treatment

121
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,918
conditions that were set up in sites

122
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:49,079
around Ithaca there's a control

123
00:04:46,918 --> 00:04:50,879
treatment with no Amendment an acidified

124
00:04:49,079 --> 00:04:53,279
treatment where Elemental sulfur was

125
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:55,560
added a nitrogen addition treatment

126
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:58,279
where uh nitrate has been added and an

127
00:04:55,560 --> 00:05:00,639
acidify plus nitrogen addition treatment

128
00:04:58,279 --> 00:05:02,439
where ammonium sulfate has been added so

129
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:04,478
the idea there is that some effects

130
00:05:02,439 --> 00:05:06,399
might be from both acidification and

131
00:05:04,478 --> 00:05:08,758
nitrogen but some might be from just

132
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:11,319
acidification or just nitrogen

133
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:14,120
addition um so we're going to call each

134
00:05:11,319 --> 00:05:16,360
of those uh treatments a plot the plot

135
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:18,680
was 40 meters by 40 meters with a 10

136
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:20,319
meter buffer and the important thing to

137
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:22,639
know here is that those uh treatments

138
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:26,000
were each replicated six times so we

139
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:28,840
have 24 total plots distributed at three

140
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,279
sites around Ithaca and in general these

141
00:05:28,839 --> 00:05:34,799
are forested hillsides that are silt LOM

142
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:36,799
and septisol but there is uh you know

143
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,600
there are some pretty big variations in

144
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,560
organic matter and pH at these different

145
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:42,639
sites so we do take that into account

146
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:45,639
when we're doing the statistical

147
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:45,639
analyses

148
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:51,399
um at each of these plots soils were

149
00:05:49,079 --> 00:05:53,918
sampled in five locations and composited

150
00:05:51,399 --> 00:05:55,799
to the PO plot level and then cved and

151
00:05:53,918 --> 00:05:57,399
four depths were taken so we have the

152
00:05:55,800 --> 00:06:00,199
forest floor which I'm going to call the

153
00:05:57,399 --> 00:06:02,599
O Horizon and then pretty pretty shallow

154
00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:05,840
depth so 0 to 3 cenm just the first top

155
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:08,360
inch of soil 3 to 10 cenm and 10 to 20

156
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:12,478
cm which all fall into the a horizon

157
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:14,319
mineral soil and down here um in this

158
00:06:12,478 --> 00:06:17,598
graphs this is just to show that we did

159
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:19,560
have acidification in

160
00:06:17,598 --> 00:06:21,560
um you know in the treatments we

161
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:24,038
expected to acidify so acidify only

162
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:26,120
brought the pH of the forest floor down

163
00:06:24,038 --> 00:06:29,879
to an average of three and a half so

164
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:31,399
this is really quite acidic um at this

165
00:06:29,879 --> 00:06:33,759
point in the study these soils that I'm

166
00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:37,719
looking at are from 2022 we only saw a

167
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:39,360
small effect of pH in the um acidify

168
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:41,599
plus n condition so that's also

169
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:44,400
important to note and then once we look

170
00:06:41,598 --> 00:06:46,598
at the 0 to 3 cmers top inches soil both

171
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:51,478
acidify plus nitrogen addition and

172
00:06:46,598 --> 00:06:53,839
acidify are bringing the pH um to around

173
00:06:51,478 --> 00:06:55,680
4.6 so I just want to ground everybody

174
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:58,198
in what kind of phes we're talking about

175
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:00,918
because some of them are really quite

176
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:03,199
acidic okay

177
00:07:00,918 --> 00:07:05,598
so uh I was not involved in the soil

178
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:07,520
sample collection and then these samples

179
00:07:05,598 --> 00:07:09,519
as I said were composited cved they make

180
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:12,079
it to me so here's where I come into the

181
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:14,399
story I receive that soil and I shake it

182
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:16,800
with water and then filter it to less

183
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:19,038
than two microns so now what we have is

184
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,439
this water soluble fraction so

185
00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:22,839
everything that's going to come off the

186
00:07:20,439 --> 00:07:24,079
soil into the water um sometimes we

187
00:07:22,839 --> 00:07:26,239
might think of this as the dissolved

188
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:28,918
organic matter and our first objective

189
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:30,360
is to find out what's in that and as

190
00:07:28,918 --> 00:07:32,120
many of you will know it can be very

191
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:33,759
hard to find out like the exact

192
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:35,720
compounds are in there there's thousands

193
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:38,919
of compounds but we're going to pick

194
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:40,160
some uh analyses to give us an idea of

195
00:07:38,918 --> 00:07:43,639
what's in there and that's that

196
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:45,919
characterization step then if you think

197
00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:48,400
about that uh water moving through the

198
00:07:45,918 --> 00:07:49,799
soil and now it's picked up various

199
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:51,439
different things into it now it's going

200
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:53,960
to start interacting with the soil

201
00:07:51,439 --> 00:07:56,199
around it so the next part to simulate

202
00:07:53,959 --> 00:07:58,198
that is a batch experiment where we take

203
00:07:56,199 --> 00:07:59,840
that dissolved organic matter and shake

204
00:07:58,199 --> 00:08:02,439
it with minerals that are found in the

205
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:04,918
soil and see what sticks so the

206
00:08:02,439 --> 00:08:07,478
Assumption here is that you have some

207
00:08:04,918 --> 00:08:09,719
amount of say carbon or nitrogen in

208
00:08:07,478 --> 00:08:11,959
solution you shake it with a mineral you

209
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:13,960
remeasure the solution and whatever

210
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:16,878
amount that's decreased that has been

211
00:08:13,959 --> 00:08:19,758
zorbed or stuck to those soil minerals

212
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:21,520
so that's uh part two and then I I've

213
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:23,199
completed the experiment but not this

214
00:08:21,519 --> 00:08:26,120
variable importance which is going to be

215
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:28,680
the next aspect and the idea there is to

216
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:31,478
say what factors are controlling how

217
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:33,519
much carbon specifically is sticking to

218
00:08:31,478 --> 00:08:36,479
these different soil minerals and then

219
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:38,639
finally objective three is uh ATR FTI

220
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:40,038
flowthrough experiment and the important

221
00:08:38,639 --> 00:08:42,838
thing to know here is we're going to

222
00:08:40,038 --> 00:08:44,759
take a a soil mineral we're going to add

223
00:08:42,839 --> 00:08:47,399
some organic matter on top of it that's

224
00:08:44,759 --> 00:08:49,519
going to create uh what we call Ma or

225
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:51,240
mineral Associated organic matter and

226
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:53,480
then we're going to run root exodites

227
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:55,919
off of that and see what happens so root

228
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:58,079
exodites can push off organic matter

229
00:08:55,919 --> 00:09:02,958
possibly off minerals or maybe they'll

230
00:08:58,078 --> 00:09:04,799
get stuck themselves so uh those are the

231
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:06,319
objectives and one really important

232
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:08,039
thing to remember the whole time I'm

233
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:10,120
talking I think U probably people in

234
00:09:08,039 --> 00:09:12,958
this room mostly already know this but

235
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:15,039
I'm not talking about bulk soil or the

236
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:17,199
carbon and nitrogen in the soil I'm

237
00:09:15,039 --> 00:09:19,719
talking about the carbon and nitrogen in

238
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:21,800
the water that comes into contact with

239
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:23,600
the soil and so I might call this the

240
00:09:21,799 --> 00:09:26,159
water soluble fraction I could call it

241
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,759
the soil solution or the aquous phase or

242
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:29,480
I might talk about soluble carbon and

243
00:09:27,759 --> 00:09:31,799
water extractable nutrients but just

244
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:33,480
remember that it's all in the water and

245
00:09:31,799 --> 00:09:35,519
why we care about this fraction is

246
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:38,720
because it's highly mobile it's

247
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:40,440
responsive to environmental changes and

248
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:42,278
it's available to plants and microbes

249
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:44,959
without a lot of additional effort on

250
00:09:42,278 --> 00:09:46,838
their part and why I have all these

251
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:48,518
arrows is not to say oh I've gotten

252
00:09:46,839 --> 00:09:50,760
every single input or output of the

253
00:09:48,519 --> 00:09:52,679
system is just to illustrate that if we

254
00:09:50,759 --> 00:09:55,159
find that we have more or less of

255
00:09:52,679 --> 00:09:56,879
something in that water soluble fraction

256
00:09:55,159 --> 00:09:59,719
it could be for a number of reasons

257
00:09:56,879 --> 00:10:01,679
maybe it's because we have more inputs

258
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:04,680
but equally it could be because we have

259
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:06,399
fewer outputs so it kind of as usual

260
00:10:04,679 --> 00:10:08,439
with soil is a mess for trying to

261
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:11,000
determine exactly why something's

262
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:13,480
happening uh but just keep that in mind

263
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:16,240
for when we see uh an

264
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:18,240
effect so jumping right into the results

265
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:21,200
I'm going to start in the O Horizon and

266
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:24,039
talk about dissolved organic carbon so

267
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:26,240
here on the left uh we see that all of

268
00:10:24,039 --> 00:10:28,199
our treatments reduced the carbon coming

269
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:30,519
off the soil at this point which is 10

270
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:34,320
years you know de into the

271
00:10:30,519 --> 00:10:36,360
study so um then we want to see what can

272
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:38,278
we say about that carbon so just saying

273
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:40,759
the amount of carbon is pretty General

274
00:10:38,278 --> 00:10:42,679
and one measurement type we can get is

275
00:10:40,759 --> 00:10:45,360
aromaticity and

276
00:10:42,679 --> 00:10:46,759
aromaticity uh you can think of as

277
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,879
sometimes people think of these Benzene

278
00:10:46,759 --> 00:10:51,000
rings so it's where you have bonds where

279
00:10:48,879 --> 00:10:54,000
electrons are shared and it tends to

280
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:56,440
make the molecules more stable um and

281
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:59,360
also if it is a complex system then it

282
00:10:56,440 --> 00:11:01,480
can add more color to those molecules so

283
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:03,440
what we see here is that the only

284
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:06,278
treatment that had an effect was our

285
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:09,079
acidification treatment and that lowered

286
00:11:06,278 --> 00:11:12,439
aromaticity of the dissolved organic

287
00:11:09,078 --> 00:11:15,679
carbon now moving to this graph uh this

288
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:17,839
is sort of a proxy measurement for size

289
00:11:15,679 --> 00:11:20,759
or molecular weight of molecules in

290
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:22,920
solution and what we find is

291
00:11:20,759 --> 00:11:24,679
acidification alone is the only

292
00:11:22,919 --> 00:11:26,519
condition that had an effect and its

293
00:11:24,679 --> 00:11:29,599
effect is if we follow this Arrow up to

294
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:31,399
make molecules smaller so we start to

295
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:33,079
get this picture as we can see down here

296
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:35,519
if we imagine these little brown balls

297
00:11:33,078 --> 00:11:38,278
as dissolved organic carbon that when we

298
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:41,120
acidify what's coming off the soil is

299
00:11:38,278 --> 00:11:43,559
less in amount of carbon it's smaller

300
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:45,639
it's lesser aromatic and I'm not showing

301
00:11:43,559 --> 00:11:48,879
the uh box plot here but it also has a

302
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:50,240
trend of less color at the same time

303
00:11:48,879 --> 00:11:52,720
when we add

304
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:55,720
nitrogen we still see less dissolved

305
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:58,278
organic carbon but no change in size

306
00:11:55,720 --> 00:12:00,040
aromaticity and at first I thought oh

307
00:11:58,278 --> 00:12:02,120
the nitrogen's having a modifying effect

308
00:12:00,039 --> 00:12:05,159
in the acidification but remember that

309
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:08,600
in this o Horizon that acidify plus n

310
00:12:05,159 --> 00:12:10,879
treatment actually wasn't that acidified

311
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:13,278
so I think uh based on the fact that

312
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:16,278
size aromaticity and color in the O

313
00:12:13,278 --> 00:12:18,198
Horizon have a linear correlation to pH

314
00:12:16,278 --> 00:12:20,559
what we're actually seeing is just an

315
00:12:18,198 --> 00:12:22,879
acidification

316
00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:25,319
effect so why might this be happening

317
00:12:22,879 --> 00:12:26,799
and this is where we get into to u i

318
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:28,879
this is not I'm just giving you some

319
00:12:26,799 --> 00:12:31,639
ideas on this and everybody else is

320
00:12:28,879 --> 00:12:35,159
welcome to add their ideas in at the end

321
00:12:31,639 --> 00:12:37,600
um so there could be biotic and abiotic

322
00:12:35,159 --> 00:12:40,719
reasons why might we have less input of

323
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:42,399
docc into our water soluble fraction

324
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:44,120
well with nitrogen addition it's been

325
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:45,600
shown that there's fewer root exits

326
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:48,039
coming into the system essentially the

327
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:49,879
trees are getting enough on their own of

328
00:12:48,039 --> 00:12:53,078
their requirements met that maybe they

329
00:12:49,879 --> 00:12:55,198
don't need to be sort of uh enhancing

330
00:12:53,078 --> 00:12:58,159
the system to to their benefit in that

331
00:12:55,198 --> 00:13:00,399
way um alternatively maybe we're

332
00:12:58,159 --> 00:13:02,799
retaining more of the

333
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:05,159
on the soil so when you have

334
00:13:02,799 --> 00:13:07,159
acidification uh that is going to take

335
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:09,919
oxygens with negative charges that are

336
00:13:07,159 --> 00:13:11,198
in solution and add a proton to them so

337
00:13:09,919 --> 00:13:13,159
now they're not going to be negatively

338
00:13:11,198 --> 00:13:15,359
charged and that tends to reduce

339
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:17,198
repulsive interactions uh between

340
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:19,159
organic organic interactions we'd be

341
00:13:17,198 --> 00:13:20,599
talking about in the O Horizon and then

342
00:13:19,159 --> 00:13:22,679
that could mean that more is retained

343
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:27,440
and less is coming off into

344
00:13:22,679 --> 00:13:29,919
solution um okay so then in terms of the

345
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:33,000
smaller size in the acidification

346
00:13:29,919 --> 00:13:36,120
treatment a biotic reason might be that

347
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:38,759
at that really low pH of 3 3.5 we could

348
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:40,919
be inhibiting microbial decomposition so

349
00:13:38,759 --> 00:13:43,360
maybe a little bit is happening but just

350
00:13:40,919 --> 00:13:45,599
they're just knocking off a few number

351
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:49,560
that are just small small sort of small

352
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:52,480
bits off the end um and then an opposite

353
00:13:49,559 --> 00:13:54,638
idea would be that in fact larger

354
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:56,959
molecules are coming into solution but

355
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:59,320
because of that acidic pH they're broken

356
00:13:56,958 --> 00:14:01,559
down into smaller molecules rapidly a

357
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:03,440
biotically so this is the type of

358
00:14:01,559 --> 00:14:05,958
thought process we're going through when

359
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:08,360
we're doing this but overall the

360
00:14:05,958 --> 00:14:09,879
implications and and this is really uh

361
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:12,199
something that other Studies have found

362
00:14:09,879 --> 00:14:14,838
also and is really important is that as

363
00:14:12,198 --> 00:14:17,120
we Rec recover from acidification the

364
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:19,199
opposite effect can happen so that means

365
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:21,720
that we would have more docc coming off

366
00:14:19,198 --> 00:14:24,479
soils but also that it's made up of

367
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:27,079
larger and more aromatic molecules with

368
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:28,560
more color and so why that matters is

369
00:14:27,078 --> 00:14:31,559
that idea of Lake Browning that I

370
00:14:28,559 --> 00:14:35,039
mentioned earlier so if we have more doc

371
00:14:31,559 --> 00:14:37,758
coming off and also it's more aromatic

372
00:14:35,039 --> 00:14:40,838
per gr uh you know per unit of carbon

373
00:14:37,759 --> 00:14:42,159
that can impart more color to waterways

374
00:14:40,839 --> 00:14:43,639
and they do actually that is something

375
00:14:42,159 --> 00:14:46,519
that other people are finding and

376
00:14:43,639 --> 00:14:48,680
researching actively um but because we

377
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:50,078
see that nitrogen addition also reduced

378
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:52,278
the total amount of dissolved organic

379
00:14:50,078 --> 00:14:54,519
carbon it seems like that the recovery

380
00:14:52,278 --> 00:14:56,480
from nitrogen addition could add to the

381
00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:59,480
effects of the recovery from

382
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,480
acidification

383
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:04,720
okay straight from carbon to nitrogen

384
00:15:01,879 --> 00:15:07,759
all the important uh players here so in

385
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:11,120
this top left box plot we see total

386
00:15:07,759 --> 00:15:14,079
dissolve nitrogen and acidification plus

387
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:17,360
nitrogen is reducing total nitrogen and

388
00:15:14,078 --> 00:15:18,758
acidification has a trend of reduction

389
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,120
all right so then we want to think well

390
00:15:18,759 --> 00:15:21,839
what kind of nitrogen are we talking

391
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:24,720
about so first we're looking at

392
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:26,279
inorganic nitrogen nitrate and ammonium

393
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:29,040
and we see something pretty interesting

394
00:15:26,278 --> 00:15:30,958
although not wholly unexpected uh here

395
00:15:29,039 --> 00:15:33,318
and purple is the acidification only

396
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:35,679
treatment and what you see is that there

397
00:15:33,318 --> 00:15:37,639
this is for nitrate in that graph so

398
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:40,239
what you see is in the O Horizon there

399
00:15:37,639 --> 00:15:42,000
is no water extractable nitrate at all

400
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:43,919
coming off of these soils under

401
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,000
acidification and when you go down into

402
00:15:43,919 --> 00:15:48,679
the top inch of soil there's still

403
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,958
almost none um and then we don't see an

404
00:15:48,679 --> 00:15:53,399
effect for the other

405
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:55,799
treatments and then on this graph this

406
00:15:53,399 --> 00:15:58,360
is ammonium and what we see is that

407
00:15:55,799 --> 00:16:00,799
there's a little increase in ammonium

408
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:03,120
under ification and a decrease in

409
00:16:00,799 --> 00:16:04,919
ammonium in acidification plus nitrogen

410
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:07,440
addition and that's kind of interesting

411
00:16:04,919 --> 00:16:09,399
if we're adding nitrogen in that

412
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:11,279
condition as ammonium you might think

413
00:16:09,399 --> 00:16:13,078
okay we're adding ammonium to the soil

414
00:16:11,278 --> 00:16:16,679
ammonium might go up that's not what we

415
00:16:13,078 --> 00:16:19,359
see um so here uh pictorially you can

416
00:16:16,679 --> 00:16:23,278
see that the ammonium in acidify it's

417
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:26,159
mostly ammonium 0% nitrate and here in

418
00:16:23,278 --> 00:16:28,000
the acidification plus nitrogen uh we

419
00:16:26,159 --> 00:16:29,559
have a little reduction in ammonium and

420
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,120
increase in nitrate

421
00:16:29,559 --> 00:16:34,958
so why might that be

422
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:37,039
happening I think uh one of the

423
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:39,679
major

424
00:16:37,039 --> 00:16:41,198
uh bacteria that we need to think about

425
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:44,159
when we talk about ammonium and nitrate

426
00:16:41,198 --> 00:16:46,439
is nitri fires um and probably there's

427
00:16:44,159 --> 00:16:48,519
at least some role going on here for why

428
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:50,000
we're seeing that so there could be a

429
00:16:48,519 --> 00:16:52,519
number of reasons that we're losing that

430
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,360
nitrate in acidify uh but a microbial

431
00:16:52,519 --> 00:16:56,560
reason would be that even though

432
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:59,480
nitrifiers can operate at some acidic

433
00:16:56,559 --> 00:17:00,599
phes again we're really acidic uh and

434
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:02,839
it's possible that we're seeing

435
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:05,480
inhibition of nitrification and so the

436
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:08,838
ammonium is accumulating and not being

437
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:10,480
converted to nitrate but uh we also

438
00:17:08,838 --> 00:17:12,759
could have more output and in fact I'm

439
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:15,279
sure these two are working together so

440
00:17:12,759 --> 00:17:17,359
from abiotically speaking nitrate is an

441
00:17:15,279 --> 00:17:19,480
annion it's not going to stick to

442
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:20,798
negatively charge soil particles so

443
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:23,279
you're just going to have loss from the

444
00:17:20,798 --> 00:17:25,639
system and as acidification pushes out

445
00:17:23,279 --> 00:17:28,160
base cations and those lead to the soil

446
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:31,440
nitrate is a good uh kind of companion

447
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:33,120
to exit with them um also we could have

448
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:36,640
more output due to chemodenitrification

449
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:38,879
or self decomposition of

450
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:40,919
nitrate and then I'm actually going to

451
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,760
uh talk about this one at the same time

452
00:17:40,919 --> 00:17:44,480
because this is still in the

453
00:17:41,759 --> 00:17:48,079
acidification treatment so as we add

454
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:49,759
protons or hydrogen ions to the solution

455
00:17:48,079 --> 00:17:52,720
uh that might also push off zorbed

456
00:17:49,759 --> 00:17:55,480
ammonium so that those are some reasons

457
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:57,720
that would explain what we see in

458
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:59,360
acidification uh how about in the

459
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:01,839
acidify plus n why would we have that

460
00:17:59,359 --> 00:18:04,519
decrease in ammonium currently my idea

461
00:18:01,839 --> 00:18:06,079
is that maybe uh we have an in increase

462
00:18:04,519 --> 00:18:07,558
in nitr fires and they're able to

463
00:18:06,079 --> 00:18:08,918
process that ammonium we're saying

464
00:18:07,558 --> 00:18:11,000
here's your substrate and we're adding

465
00:18:08,919 --> 00:18:12,559
it every single year here you go and

466
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,240
maybe they're pretty good at at

467
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:16,440
processing that and continually putting

468
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:19,640
out nitrate into the system and you

469
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:21,240
really need that kind of continuous um

470
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:22,640
input of nitrate because again it's not

471
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:24,359
going to be retained in the soil it's

472
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:26,640
either going to be taken up by plants or

473
00:18:24,359 --> 00:18:28,959
leech leech

474
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:30,440
out um and what we've seen is that water

475
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:32,960
extractable nitrate was completely

476
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:35,200
absent after a decade of acidification

477
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:37,720
and it's not the nitrogen addition but

478
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:41,319
the acidity that is the major factor

479
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:41,319
influencing uh nitrogen

480
00:18:41,839 --> 00:18:46,000
speciation okay so now we're going to

481
00:18:43,599 --> 00:18:49,359
move out of the O Horizon and into the

482
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:51,319
mineral soil and uh we have a new a new

483
00:18:49,359 --> 00:18:53,439
player in the game and that's aluminum

484
00:18:51,319 --> 00:18:55,359
so what this first graph is showing is

485
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:57,679
the relationship between aluminum and

486
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:59,359
dissolved organic carbon and this is a

487
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:01,919
known relationship

488
00:18:59,359 --> 00:19:03,439
uh so again not wildly surprising but I

489
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:05,038
think the important thing to emphasize

490
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:07,200
here is we don't see a relationship in

491
00:19:05,038 --> 00:19:09,200
the O Horizon so aluminum's really not

492
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:11,919
playing a role even though we have those

493
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:14,279
really acidic soils in the O Horizon

494
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:18,000
then when we get down even an inch down

495
00:19:14,279 --> 00:19:18,000
all of the side and we see that

496
00:19:18,038 --> 00:19:23,558
correlation so moving to this graph on

497
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:27,558
the upper right um this is showing size

498
00:19:23,558 --> 00:19:30,519
or parent molecular weight on the y-

499
00:19:27,558 --> 00:19:32,319
axis to aluminum on the x-axis and again

500
00:19:30,519 --> 00:19:34,798
what we're seeing is that aluminum is

501
00:19:32,319 --> 00:19:36,480
really not affecting the O Horizon and

502
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:38,720
very you know essentially not in the

503
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:41,319
first in soil but once we get down a

504
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:43,400
little deeper to 3 to 10 centimeters as

505
00:19:41,319 --> 00:19:46,480
we increase in aluminum molecules are

506
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:48,880
getting larger in size and so a lot of

507
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:50,558
times people talk about cation bridging

508
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:52,360
which is the idea that a positively

509
00:19:50,558 --> 00:19:54,519
charged particle with more than one

510
00:19:52,359 --> 00:19:58,079
positive charge could essentially

511
00:19:54,519 --> 00:20:00,000
mediate between two negatively charged

512
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:02,399
uh carb containing molecules so if you

513
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,960
have two carboxilic acids with negative

514
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:07,038
charges and you have say a calcium with

515
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:08,840
a charge of plus two in the middle it's

516
00:20:07,038 --> 00:20:10,519
kind of making everyone play nice right

517
00:20:08,839 --> 00:20:13,240
it's making it so that you can have a

518
00:20:10,519 --> 00:20:15,079
little more um a little less space

519
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:18,440
between those negative charges and

520
00:20:15,079 --> 00:20:19,798
aluminum is a plus three uh ion and we

521
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:21,360
could expect that the same thing might

522
00:20:19,798 --> 00:20:24,639
be happening so this could be evidence

523
00:20:21,359 --> 00:20:26,639
of that then on this bottom graph uh

524
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:29,280
this is showing a romatic again and

525
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:32,919
there is a relationship in between

526
00:20:29,279 --> 00:20:35,038
aromatic aromaticity and size in the O

527
00:20:32,919 --> 00:20:37,200
Horizon and the top inch of soil but

528
00:20:35,038 --> 00:20:39,480
it's pretty flat you can see that here

529
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:42,880
but then once we get to 3 to 10

530
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:44,679
centimeters uh we see a a steeper slope

531
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:47,919
and that's saying as we have more

532
00:20:44,679 --> 00:20:50,759
aromatic molecules they're larger so we

533
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:53,759
start to get this picture where there's

534
00:20:50,759 --> 00:20:56,640
more aluminum in solution more carbon in

535
00:20:53,759 --> 00:20:59,440
solution they're larger molecules with

536
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:01,320
more aluminum and we have these larger

537
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:05,200
arom when there's more

538
00:21:01,319 --> 00:21:07,240
aromaticity and so uh why we better

539
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:09,640
click along here um so why would we care

540
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:12,038
about that so the next part is leading

541
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:13,960
into the batch experiments so once we

542
00:21:12,038 --> 00:21:15,960
have an idea of what's maybe making

543
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:19,079
larger molecules which tend to sit down

544
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:20,679
on Mineral surfaces uh more and we get

545
00:21:19,079 --> 00:21:22,359
the sense that aluminum is playing a

546
00:21:20,679 --> 00:21:25,000
role in that and we get a sense of how

547
00:21:22,359 --> 00:21:27,519
much carbon we have in solution now we

548
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:30,000
want to know how is it going to stick to

549
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:33,038
the other uh the rest of the

550
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,880
soil and so for this we're we move to

551
00:21:33,038 --> 00:21:37,400
objective two which is the batch

552
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:39,720
experiments and so I extracted dissolved

553
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:42,880
organic matter from the 0 to3 cimer

554
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:46,038
layer and then shook it with gerti an

555
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:48,640
iron oxide hydroxide cholite a one:1

556
00:21:46,038 --> 00:21:51,839
alumino silicate clay gibbsite an

557
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:53,440
aluminum hydroxide and the 3 to 10 cm

558
00:21:51,839 --> 00:21:57,319
soil which I'm not going to show the

559
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:59,240
results of uh right now but uh this

560
00:21:57,319 --> 00:22:00,759
graph which is um again I'm only going

561
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:02,319
to show one result from this we're still

562
00:22:00,759 --> 00:22:04,798
processing the data but this graph I

563
00:22:02,319 --> 00:22:07,879
think is kind of cool uh this is

564
00:22:04,798 --> 00:22:10,759
aluminum zorbed on the xais and organic

565
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:12,320
carbon zorbed on the y- axis so if we

566
00:22:10,759 --> 00:22:15,240
just look at the amount of organic

567
00:22:12,319 --> 00:22:17,720
carbon zorbed to the soil we see as

568
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:20,599
expected kite is really not absorbing

569
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:22,278
very much carbon and then uh gibbsite

570
00:22:20,599 --> 00:22:24,079
and gerti are absorbing you know at

571
00:22:22,278 --> 00:22:27,119
least in the same order of

572
00:22:24,079 --> 00:22:29,759
magnitude and the interesting part is we

573
00:22:27,119 --> 00:22:32,119
saw that aluminum associ with carbon in

574
00:22:29,759 --> 00:22:34,640
the solution but now we're still seeing

575
00:22:32,119 --> 00:22:37,038
it on what's been zorbed so what's left

576
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:38,759
the solution once we shake it with those

577
00:22:37,038 --> 00:22:41,158
minerals

578
00:22:38,759 --> 00:22:43,319
um and there could be a couple reasons

579
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:47,080
we might be seeing this so This bottom

580
00:22:43,319 --> 00:22:49,038
one um is saying here's aluminum

581
00:22:47,079 --> 00:22:51,558
associating with organic molecules in

582
00:22:49,038 --> 00:22:54,879
solution just like we saw maybe on that

583
00:22:51,558 --> 00:22:57,918
previous slide and then uh it's this is

584
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:59,720
a chem aborption to the iron and gerti

585
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:02,278
and it's sort of all helping it come

586
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:04,519
together kind of coor together or

587
00:23:02,278 --> 00:23:09,079
alternatively maybe aluminum first zorbs

588
00:23:04,519 --> 00:23:11,839
to the gerti and then allows for um more

589
00:23:09,079 --> 00:23:13,439
organic compounds to pile on so either

590
00:23:11,839 --> 00:23:15,278
way we're going to be investigating

591
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:17,480
what's going on there and seeing whether

592
00:23:15,278 --> 00:23:19,798
we can see particularly we can look for

593
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:22,000
this Bond here of iron oxygen aluminum

594
00:23:19,798 --> 00:23:23,079
so that's something we'll be continuing

595
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,159
to

596
00:23:23,079 --> 00:23:28,519
do all right uh for now that's going to

597
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:29,919
wrap up the Master's project disc

598
00:23:28,519 --> 00:23:32,599
session and I'll move on to what I'm

599
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:34,600
proposing for my dissertation proposal

600
00:23:32,599 --> 00:23:37,759
um while this is still relevant in

601
00:23:34,599 --> 00:23:41,359
Forest soils I'm actually uh mentally

602
00:23:37,759 --> 00:23:43,480
shifting more to agricultural soils um I

603
00:23:41,359 --> 00:23:46,278
think that we talk about soil health and

604
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:47,240
nutrient cycling and how to build soil

605
00:23:46,278 --> 00:23:49,798
Health which is something really

606
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:52,240
important to me as a small farmer and

607
00:23:49,798 --> 00:23:54,639
one thing we notice is one way is to add

608
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:56,440
plant matter and nutrients so what does

609
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:58,759
all that plant matter have it has

610
00:23:56,440 --> 00:24:00,600
cellulose and so how that cell cose

611
00:23:58,759 --> 00:24:02,200
breaks down and how it interacts how

612
00:24:00,599 --> 00:24:04,719
quickly it breaks down is going to

613
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:07,159
affect that nutrient cycling through the

614
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:09,919
system so I'd like to look at five

615
00:24:07,159 --> 00:24:12,200
factors on cellulose decomposition pH

616
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:14,159
enzyme and cellulose concentration the

617
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:16,400
presence of three soil minerals probably

618
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:17,960
the ones um I just showed the presence

619
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:20,440
of low molecular weight organic

620
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:22,480
molecules like amino acids and then the

621
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:24,880
presence of a divalent cation and an

622
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:27,038
agricultural systems calcium is probably

623
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,399
the one we'd want to look at because uh

624
00:24:27,038 --> 00:24:31,319
obviously when you're liming you're

625
00:24:28,398 --> 00:24:33,678
adding calcium to soils so the question

626
00:24:31,319 --> 00:24:37,759
is uh could could these different

627
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:40,720
factors affect how quickly celluloses

628
00:24:37,759 --> 00:24:42,278
cycling and the sort of inspiration for

629
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:45,319
this comes from the way cellulose

630
00:24:42,278 --> 00:24:47,519
enzymes work so here this is cellulose

631
00:24:45,319 --> 00:24:49,599
it's made up of chains of glucose

632
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:51,398
monomers called fibral that are then

633
00:24:49,599 --> 00:24:55,000
hydrogen bonded together and this

634
00:24:51,398 --> 00:24:56,719
actually rigid crystallin structure then

635
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,480
to break it down you need three

636
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:01,759
different types of enzymes endo

637
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:04,120
glucanases exoglucanases and beta

638
00:25:01,759 --> 00:25:06,679
glycosidases um and this is an example

639
00:25:04,119 --> 00:25:08,439
of exoglucanase cell 7A and I just think

640
00:25:06,679 --> 00:25:12,000
this is so cool this is a molecular

641
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:15,200
Dynamics simulation of the

642
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,200
oh hold

643
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:22,399
on

644
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:24,480
whoa so that's a a simulation molecular

645
00:25:22,398 --> 00:25:27,000
simulation of that enzyme at work and

646
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:29,319
what we see is that here it's picking up

647
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:31,278
a fibral off the cellul surface and it's

648
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:34,319
going to be knocking off two and three

649
00:25:31,278 --> 00:25:35,839
chunks of cellulose at a time off uh the

650
00:25:34,319 --> 00:25:37,960
back end here out of the catalytic

651
00:25:35,839 --> 00:25:39,759
domain and then it has this flexible

652
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:42,038
Linker and in the front it has a

653
00:25:39,759 --> 00:25:44,319
carbohydrate binding module which they

654
00:25:42,038 --> 00:25:46,519
sometimes call foot and that's that's

655
00:25:44,319 --> 00:25:48,398
anchoring that enzyme to the surface so

656
00:25:46,519 --> 00:25:51,519
that's a really important part of the

657
00:25:48,398 --> 00:25:53,558
whole thing and in this foot uh we can

658
00:25:51,519 --> 00:25:55,759
see it zoomed in over here it's got

659
00:25:53,558 --> 00:25:58,398
three amino acid residues that are

660
00:25:55,759 --> 00:26:00,440
helping it bind and those are tyrosine

661
00:25:58,398 --> 00:26:02,879
so the question is this is going to be

662
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:05,080
processing along the cellulose surface

663
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:07,880
breaking down these little units as it

664
00:26:05,079 --> 00:26:10,278
goes what happens if it hits an obstacle

665
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:12,720
and so when we think of uh aborption and

666
00:26:10,278 --> 00:26:15,119
protective absorption some ways that we

667
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:17,120
might see that for uh the cellulose

668
00:26:15,119 --> 00:26:19,038
enzyme would be the enzyme could bind to

669
00:26:17,119 --> 00:26:21,079
a mineral and then not be able to get to

670
00:26:19,038 --> 00:26:23,079
cellulose and break it down in the soil

671
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:24,879
or maybe the cellulose could bind to a

672
00:26:23,079 --> 00:26:27,960
mineral and then not be available for

673
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:29,559
the enzyme but another type that I want

674
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:32,360
to inv investigate is what if something

675
00:26:29,558 --> 00:26:34,200
binds to the cellulose like what if a

676
00:26:32,359 --> 00:26:36,479
couple tyrosines come in here could they

677
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:38,679
bind and would that then block the

678
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:42,319
process of of this enzyme moving down

679
00:26:38,679 --> 00:26:43,720
the surface so to test that um I have

680
00:26:42,319 --> 00:26:45,879
these eight different treatment

681
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:47,839
conditions and I'm going to shake each

682
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:49,880
of them with cellulose to allow any

683
00:26:47,839 --> 00:26:52,278
interactions that are going to happen to

684
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:55,240
happen uh and then we'll add an enzyme

685
00:26:52,278 --> 00:26:57,038
mix from a fungus called trod damari

686
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:59,599
that has the ability to break down the

687
00:26:57,038 --> 00:27:01,079
cellulose all the the way to glucose so

688
00:26:59,599 --> 00:27:04,240
then we can measure glucose as a

689
00:27:01,079 --> 00:27:06,480
function of time and see how much uh

690
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:09,000
cellulose is being broken down and the

691
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:11,240
idea would be uh we assume that some

692
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:13,240
some in some of these conditions you'll

693
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:14,960
find protective absorption of different

694
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:17,440
types and then we can investigate what

695
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:17,440
we see

696
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:22,440
there okay and then finally for

697
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:24,159
objective two I'd like to link this

698
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:27,200
technique called density functional

699
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:29,799
Theory um and see if we can get it to be

700
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:32,080
predictive in a slightly more macro

701
00:27:29,798 --> 00:27:34,319
scale of enzymatic breakdown so what

702
00:27:32,079 --> 00:27:36,158
that might look like is in density

703
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:38,359
functional Theory which is based on

704
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:40,679
quantum mechanics and models electron

705
00:27:38,359 --> 00:27:42,719
configurations we can model a surface

706
00:27:40,679 --> 00:27:45,278
like a mineral surface or the cellulose

707
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:47,480
surface and then we can Model A molecule

708
00:27:45,278 --> 00:27:50,278
like an amino acid and then we can put

709
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:52,839
them together and see how they bind and

710
00:27:50,278 --> 00:27:56,880
so the question is and I don't don't

711
00:27:52,839 --> 00:27:58,879
know the answer but can we um if we can

712
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:00,480
accurately by collaborating it with

713
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:02,679
laboratory experiments if we can

714
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:05,278
accurately predict which molecules are

715
00:28:02,679 --> 00:28:07,880
going to bind more strongly can we use

716
00:28:05,278 --> 00:28:10,240
that to predict whether or not say an

717
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:12,440
enzyme is going to have uh trouble

718
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:14,599
breaking something down and so that's

719
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:17,759
the idea with this and why why it's

720
00:28:14,599 --> 00:28:19,119
exciting is um partly because it's high

721
00:28:17,759 --> 00:28:21,119
throughput so once you model your

722
00:28:19,119 --> 00:28:22,798
surface you can Model A lot of different

723
00:28:21,119 --> 00:28:24,359
molecules although again you have to

724
00:28:22,798 --> 00:28:26,599
corroborate the results with your

725
00:28:24,359 --> 00:28:27,959
laboratory results um and then there's

726
00:28:26,599 --> 00:28:29,359
this question could it be predictive

727
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:31,759
that be pretty exciting if we could

728
00:28:29,359 --> 00:28:33,479
measure a cellulo surface measure how

729
00:28:31,759 --> 00:28:35,519
tightly something bound to it and that

730
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:37,720
correlated to how efficient the enzyme

731
00:28:35,519 --> 00:28:39,480
was uh I'm not sure that'll be possible

732
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:42,278
but that'd be exciting I

733
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:43,679
think um so that's everything I wanted

734
00:28:42,278 --> 00:28:45,839
to share with you today and I really

735
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:47,759
appreciate everybody coming and I'd like

736
00:28:45,839 --> 00:28:50,798
to open it up for

737
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:53,480
questions johannas yeah thank you very

738
00:28:50,798 --> 00:28:55,839
much Alysa great data and wonderfully

739
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:58,278
presented congratulations I just some

740
00:28:55,839 --> 00:29:00,519
Nitty Gritty questions I wanted to learn

741
00:28:58,278 --> 00:29:01,919
you you said you're you're filtering

742
00:29:00,519 --> 00:29:05,599
your doc at

743
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:10,640
0.22 why that soil scientists usually do

744
00:29:05,599 --> 00:29:12,079
0.45 aquatic scientist 0.7 why 0.2 well

745
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:13,278
I I think that the goal with all the

746
00:29:12,079 --> 00:29:15,240
filtering is to make sure you're not

747
00:29:13,278 --> 00:29:17,798
getting like mic I mean like microb

748
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:20,558
sterile so not getting microbial biomass

749
00:29:17,798 --> 00:29:22,960
U but also not getting like fine soil

750
00:29:20,558 --> 00:29:25,759
particles uh so I think that we just

751
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:27,720
chose point two to make sure we weren't

752
00:29:25,759 --> 00:29:30,158
getting anything in that range I think

753
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:33,519
there's a I think there are some things

754
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:37,880
between 0.2 and 04 um particularly like

755
00:29:33,519 --> 00:29:40,038
colloidal yeah lcms we doing Z point two

756
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:42,320
yeah um so I was just wondering whether

757
00:29:40,038 --> 00:29:43,798
there was a some other reason that I I

758
00:29:42,319 --> 00:29:45,278
was no it's just that reason and I'm

759
00:29:43,798 --> 00:29:47,440
trying to remember the chart of the

760
00:29:45,278 --> 00:29:48,759
different sizes but I remember at some

761
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:51,240
point looking at it and that's what we

762
00:29:48,759 --> 00:29:52,919
chose yeah it's always interesting how

763
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:54,359
the different fields are are using

764
00:29:52,919 --> 00:29:56,519
different cut offs right so you might

765
00:29:54,359 --> 00:30:00,038
lose a little bit that's in that range

766
00:29:56,519 --> 00:30:03,200
of 02 to point4 yeah yeah yeah um did

767
00:30:00,038 --> 00:30:05,679
you have another one yeah few ones so

768
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:08,720
did you look at do you think sulfur

769
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:10,798
plays a role in in in all of that I mean

770
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:12,480
you you H it on the nitrogen and acidity

771
00:30:10,798 --> 00:30:14,480
but then there's sulfur as well and I

772
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:16,679
know that you fundamentally change when

773
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:19,679
you add sulfur yes and also with the

774
00:30:16,679 --> 00:30:22,919
historic emissions uh that it changes

775
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:25,480
organic sulfur forms um yeah I think

776
00:30:22,919 --> 00:30:27,200
play a ro I'm sure it plays a role yeah

777
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:29,720
and and sulfur can be involved you know

778
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:31,120
there's redo reactions going on there

779
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:33,759
and in fact when we add the elemental

780
00:30:31,119 --> 00:30:37,000
sulfur it's primarily acidifying by

781
00:30:33,759 --> 00:30:38,879
microbial oxidation um so yeah it's a

782
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:41,640
lot of sulfur cycling going on and

783
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:45,200
unfortunately we were not well set up to

784
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:46,759
measure um The sulfur in solution so I

785
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:48,120
don't have a lot to say about it but

786
00:30:46,759 --> 00:30:49,679
that's definitely an important role and

787
00:30:48,119 --> 00:30:52,599
I do know some other papers are looking

788
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:54,720
at like sulfate concentrations also that

789
00:30:52,599 --> 00:30:56,240
be the counter iion for your yeah it

790
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:58,200
could in fact what could be a counter

791
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:00,679
ion primarily nitrate and sulfate it's a

792
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:03,000
really good point yeah yeah thank you

793
00:31:00,679 --> 00:31:03,000
yeah of

794
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:07,840
course yeah Jonathan I got a question if

795
00:31:05,599 --> 00:31:10,959
the aluminum component since you're

796
00:31:07,839 --> 00:31:13,839
reifying yes that the going from the SKB

797
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:16,319
site into these ionic state aluminums

798
00:31:13,839 --> 00:31:18,119
but with the pH you're you're increasing

799
00:31:16,319 --> 00:31:20,200
you're as you decrease the pH you're

800
00:31:18,119 --> 00:31:22,558
increasing accelerating aluminum

801
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:25,120
concentrations I'm

802
00:31:22,558 --> 00:31:29,398
wondering certainly from a concept of

803
00:31:25,119 --> 00:31:31,719
recovery from acidification what's the

804
00:31:29,398 --> 00:31:33,918
what's the tag there that this is what

805
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:36,200
we're going to see is recovery rather

806
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:38,278
than this is just more we're not mean

807
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:41,679
it's no no more acid brain in a sense of

808
00:31:38,278 --> 00:31:43,119
the EPA but still I actually think um

809
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:44,919
that's something I'm really interested

810
00:31:43,119 --> 00:31:46,158
in thinking about and I don't know if

811
00:31:44,919 --> 00:31:48,080
other people have this problem but I

812
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:50,200
find my mind can go round and round in

813
00:31:48,079 --> 00:31:51,480
these sort of different Circles of oh

814
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:53,798
may maybe it'd be this way or maybe it

815
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:55,558
would happen this way but um it it

816
00:31:53,798 --> 00:31:57,480
depends what role aluminum's playing in

817
00:31:55,558 --> 00:31:59,558
the aborption so we're not seeing it in

818
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:01,679
the oh Horizon and a lot of the research

819
00:31:59,558 --> 00:32:03,879
out there that's similar that's looking

820
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:05,278
at that runoff into streams and Lake

821
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:08,120
Browning is talking about what's coming

822
00:32:05,278 --> 00:32:09,720
from the O Horizon so but the O Horizon

823
00:32:08,119 --> 00:32:11,558
is not GNA be shch of aluminum exactly

824
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:13,480
right exactly so so that's interesting

825
00:32:11,558 --> 00:32:15,278
so so it depends is that going to be

826
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:17,919
going into the soil and then interacting

827
00:32:15,278 --> 00:32:20,079
with aluminum uh or is it just running

828
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:21,519
off the surface but if it's in the soil

829
00:32:20,079 --> 00:32:23,038
I would expect that what I mean what

830
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:25,319
we're seeing is more aluminum is

831
00:32:23,038 --> 00:32:28,000
actually helping it stick around so I

832
00:32:25,319 --> 00:32:29,839
would expect that as the pH goes up that

833
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:33,000
it would reduce aluminum and that that

834
00:32:29,839 --> 00:32:35,038
could also exacerbate uh losing you know

835
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,278
more carbon that that's the way I was

836
00:32:35,038 --> 00:32:38,278
looking at it anyway you're thinking

837
00:32:36,278 --> 00:32:40,759
that's more like a Spoto than the

838
00:32:38,278 --> 00:32:42,919
incepto that we have around here I mean

839
00:32:40,759 --> 00:32:45,079
there's that experiment that's up on

840
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:46,759
Turkey Hill or game farm well not game

841
00:32:45,079 --> 00:32:49,199
farm up to Mount Pleasant that they

842
00:32:46,759 --> 00:32:51,960
actually put the trees in place okay to

843
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:54,679
see if the I mean because it's the O

844
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:56,919
Horizon proding the acids y if the if

845
00:32:54,679 --> 00:32:58,919
the organic material that's coming from

846
00:32:56,919 --> 00:33:01,240
these trees are actually creating the

847
00:32:58,919 --> 00:33:04,519
spodic horizons which would then be

848
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:06,038
these BHS and bhs's farther down and

849
00:33:04,519 --> 00:33:08,120
when you when I looked at those numbers

850
00:33:06,038 --> 00:33:10,440
that you were saying this is the a

851
00:33:08,119 --> 00:33:13,319
horizon those those aren't a Horizons

852
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:16,360
you got an A Horizon that's may be this

853
00:33:13,319 --> 00:33:18,839
thick and yeah they like the soil series

854
00:33:16,359 --> 00:33:20,479
they consider it AP I don't know you

855
00:33:18,839 --> 00:33:23,678
know I don't know depends how you want

856
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:25,038
to think about it maybe yeah I I mean I

857
00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:28,559
think it's all effectively been

858
00:33:25,038 --> 00:33:30,679
Disturbed soil at some point so um but

859
00:33:28,558 --> 00:33:32,200
but I do think that that thinking about

860
00:33:30,679 --> 00:33:33,720
how the recovery acidification will

861
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:35,600
affect the aluminum is important and

862
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:39,000
whether something like calcium or a

863
00:33:35,599 --> 00:33:41,480
different uh Dent you know cat could

864
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:43,599
sort of take over some of that uh

865
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:46,558
bridging role would be interesting but

866
00:33:43,599 --> 00:33:48,839
um not something we're at yet I guess

867
00:33:46,558 --> 00:33:52,240
yeah thank you yeah of

868
00:33:48,839 --> 00:33:55,879
course any other

869
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:59,720
questions no okay so then Applause and

870
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:59,720
I'll will see you next
