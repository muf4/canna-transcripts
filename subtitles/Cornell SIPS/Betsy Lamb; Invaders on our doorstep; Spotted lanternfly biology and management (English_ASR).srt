1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,339
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:04,339
University

3
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:13,510
so you have not accidentally wandered

4
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:15,969
into an entomology talk this is actually

5
00:00:13,509 --> 00:00:17,410
a horticultural talk but because it's an

6
00:00:15,968 --> 00:00:19,269
insect that affects a lot of potential

7
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:20,679
plants um it's something that I thought

8
00:00:19,269 --> 00:00:24,099
people would be a would it be of

9
00:00:20,679 --> 00:00:24,489
interest to the horticulture seminar

10
00:00:24,099 --> 00:00:26,679
group

11
00:00:24,489 --> 00:00:28,449
I'm also and Nina noticed I actually do

12
00:00:26,679 --> 00:00:30,278
have a doorstep on my pick a picture of

13
00:00:28,449 --> 00:00:31,929
a doorstep so we'll get to that and

14
00:00:30,278 --> 00:00:33,850
explain it a little bit more so I'm

15
00:00:31,929 --> 00:00:35,259
gonna ask you questions to start out cuz

16
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:36,760
you know it's lunchtime and I have to

17
00:00:35,259 --> 00:00:39,039
keep everybody awake how many people

18
00:00:36,759 --> 00:00:41,858
have already heard of spotted Lantern

19
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:45,998
fly very good how many of you are from

20
00:00:41,859 --> 00:00:47,859
Pennsylvania if that helps okay so

21
00:00:45,999 --> 00:00:49,629
that's a start all right are there

22
00:00:47,859 --> 00:00:54,338
spotted Lantern fly populations in New

23
00:00:49,628 --> 00:00:56,049
York State at the moment yes okay so we

24
00:00:54,338 --> 00:00:56,649
have some yeses in some noes good we'll

25
00:00:56,049 --> 00:00:59,378
cover that

26
00:00:56,649 --> 00:01:02,980
what's the host range you can shout out

27
00:00:59,378 --> 00:01:05,170
anything that that's a pretty good

28
00:01:02,979 --> 00:01:07,420
answer so far as far as we know so far

29
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:10,570
and is there anything we should be doing

30
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:12,340
about it yes that's that's always a good

31
00:01:10,569 --> 00:01:13,659
answer there's almost always yes we

32
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:16,120
should be doing something about it and

33
00:01:13,659 --> 00:01:18,509
then is there any good news iÃ­ll answer

34
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:20,800
that one I think the answer is yes yep

35
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:25,450
CRISPR oh I haven't heard about that so

36
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:27,689
you could bring that up at the end so is

37
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:30,730
that the answer he gives to everything

38
00:01:27,689 --> 00:01:32,560
so if you haven't heard of it it's

39
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:35,050
spotted Lantern fly as a plant hopper

40
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:39,159
it's from China and it has moved across

41
00:01:35,049 --> 00:01:42,519
the universe actually just the world and

42
00:01:39,159 --> 00:01:44,500
even came in they believe on stones egg

43
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:46,929
masses came in on stone brought from

44
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:48,670
Korea I think as far as they understand

45
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:49,900
he was introduced to Korea about the

46
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:53,290
same time it was introduced to the

47
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:55,690
United States which is around 200 2014

48
00:01:53,290 --> 00:01:58,090
so you can see it is a beautiful insect

49
00:01:55,689 --> 00:02:04,120
if you happen to like insects let's see

50
00:01:58,090 --> 00:02:06,040
do I have a pointer I don't know oops

51
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:07,570
that's always a bad thing to do I won't

52
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:09,368
do that again one of the things I want

53
00:02:07,569 --> 00:02:12,219
you to note though is the size markers

54
00:02:09,368 --> 00:02:14,680
and you can see it's not the actual size

55
00:02:12,219 --> 00:02:16,030
is not this big but it is a half an inch

56
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:18,239
and I'm going to pass these around these

57
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:22,030
are not great but they at least show you

58
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:25,270
how big the insect is that we're talking

59
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:28,000
so yeah don'ts about the don'ts about an

60
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:29,920
inch you notice that when they fly into

61
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,959
you they're pretty big and they don't

62
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:34,329
they do fly they also hop they're good

63
00:02:31,959 --> 00:02:35,469
hoppers their planners so I'm gonna talk

64
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:37,660
a little bit about it but you'll see

65
00:02:35,469 --> 00:02:39,219
this kind of picture gets put out a lot

66
00:02:37,659 --> 00:02:40,900
because one of the things we're most

67
00:02:39,219 --> 00:02:43,959
interested in is that people are looking

68
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:46,750
for it and identifying it so if it does

69
00:02:43,959 --> 00:02:48,489
occur in New York State you'll know

70
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:50,139
about it so there's the here's the

71
00:02:48,489 --> 00:02:51,939
answer to that first question does are

72
00:02:50,139 --> 00:02:54,279
they're spotted Lantern fly populations

73
00:02:51,939 --> 00:02:55,930
in New York State at the moment as far

74
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:58,269
as we know you know scientists we have

75
00:02:55,930 --> 00:03:00,819
to qualify everything there are no

76
00:02:58,269 --> 00:03:02,799
existing populations in the state but if

77
00:03:00,818 --> 00:03:05,079
you look at all these orange spots those

78
00:03:02,799 --> 00:03:07,239
are all times that has been found for

79
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:09,459
example Monroe County they found at

80
00:03:07,239 --> 00:03:10,989
least 37 in an order of Christmas trees

81
00:03:09,459 --> 00:03:13,750
that were brought up from Pennsylvania

82
00:03:10,989 --> 00:03:15,250
cut Christmas trees it was first

83
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:18,810
identified actually in Dutchess County

84
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:22,120
and it was in a pharmaco pharmacology

85
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:23,860
pharmacological warehouse somebody

86
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:25,810
noticed it and that's when they first

87
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:28,269
that's first time they found it in New

88
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:32,109
York State so it was introduced in right

89
00:03:28,269 --> 00:03:35,849
around here in Pennsylvania and it has

90
00:03:32,109 --> 00:03:38,230
spread since 2014 that looks pretty bad

91
00:03:35,849 --> 00:03:41,259
like it's spreading it's continuing to

92
00:03:38,229 --> 00:03:46,298
spread and it is every time I go and

93
00:03:41,259 --> 00:03:49,060
look for this management website I have

94
00:03:46,299 --> 00:03:50,290
to keep making it it's bigger it takes

95
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:52,959
up more space because it keeps adding

96
00:03:50,289 --> 00:03:55,328
more states for locations either where

97
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:56,920
its existing populations blue or yellow

98
00:03:55,329 --> 00:04:00,549
where they found it and not not a

99
00:03:56,919 --> 00:04:02,559
population so it looks bad but the thing

100
00:04:00,549 --> 00:04:05,200
to me that's absolutely amazing it's it

101
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:08,019
is not yet there is no no no nations yet

102
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:09,879
in New York State and everyone assumed

103
00:04:08,019 --> 00:04:11,109
that we would get it last summer that we

104
00:04:09,879 --> 00:04:17,350
would have it last summer we don't have

105
00:04:11,109 --> 00:04:20,530
it yet what does that say to you what's

106
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:22,419
it well not that because you're right

107
00:04:20,529 --> 00:04:23,679
that the winters are cold enough to kill

108
00:04:22,418 --> 00:04:25,839
the adults they're not cold enough to

109
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,850
kill the egg nests what it means to me

110
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:30,609
is we've done a good job of keeping an

111
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:32,770
eye out for it and preventing it from

112
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:34,930
coming in so in Pennsylvania is doing a

113
00:04:32,769 --> 00:04:35,389
ton of work and are very generous and

114
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:38,418
sharing

115
00:04:35,389 --> 00:04:39,800
with us so not yet in New York State so

116
00:04:38,418 --> 00:04:41,779
it's not here why should we talk about

117
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:43,610
it start looking at the numbers and

118
00:04:41,779 --> 00:04:45,138
losses from Pennsylvania will give you

119
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:47,569
an indication of why we'd like to keep

120
00:04:45,139 --> 00:04:48,949
it out as long as possible and also be

121
00:04:47,569 --> 00:04:51,680
ready for it when it gets here

122
00:04:48,949 --> 00:04:53,300
so the AG AG department so 18 million

123
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,310
dollars in plant based commodities in

124
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:58,788
the state that doesn't include homeowner

125
00:04:55,310 --> 00:05:00,079
business tourism losses Pennsylvania has

126
00:04:58,788 --> 00:05:02,959
added three billion to their state

127
00:05:00,079 --> 00:05:07,609
budget to control it they have I think

128
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:09,438
four full-time hotline people but to

129
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:11,240
answer calls when people call that they

130
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:13,159
are recording it or that they they want

131
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:15,168
to know if they found it they also the

132
00:05:13,158 --> 00:05:17,389
problem that people are calling 9-1-1 so

133
00:05:15,168 --> 00:05:19,878
they have really have ads out that say

134
00:05:17,389 --> 00:05:22,490
please don't call 9-1-1 for spotted

135
00:05:19,879 --> 00:05:24,939
lanterns line they also have a lot of

136
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:28,968
you can get spotted land reply earrings

137
00:05:24,939 --> 00:05:31,789
socks all sorts of things so it is a

138
00:05:28,968 --> 00:05:34,639
beautiful so one of the things is why is

139
00:05:31,788 --> 00:05:36,259
it such a problem it's easy to kill with

140
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:38,300
pesticides it's a little hard to catch

141
00:05:36,259 --> 00:05:39,770
them they're good jumpers does this

142
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:47,210
picture give you any idea why they might

143
00:05:39,769 --> 00:05:50,448
be there as the egg masses in particular

144
00:05:47,209 --> 00:05:53,088
are hard to see the adults are pretty

145
00:05:50,449 --> 00:05:56,360
easy to see but look at the numbers it

146
00:05:53,088 --> 00:05:58,490
occurs in huge numbers I have never seen

147
00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:01,098
insects that mass like that it would

148
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:02,629
seem contouring contraindicated that you

149
00:06:01,098 --> 00:06:05,088
know they're all sharing the same flow

150
00:06:02,629 --> 00:06:06,889
of source so they're all competing with

151
00:06:05,088 --> 00:06:07,598
each other but they are very happy

152
00:06:06,889 --> 00:06:09,800
together

153
00:06:07,598 --> 00:06:11,149
unfortunately so what's one thing that

154
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:16,338
you notice from this picture with it

155
00:06:11,149 --> 00:06:18,258
apple trees in it the tree looks fine

156
00:06:16,338 --> 00:06:20,990
the leaves are still okay what really

157
00:06:18,259 --> 00:06:22,669
looks fine the fruit they don't feed on

158
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:24,079
the fruit they feed in the woody tissue

159
00:06:22,668 --> 00:06:27,799
so they're feeding in the phloem so

160
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:29,329
they're set and they're really they look

161
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:31,550
this picture little kind of malevolence

162
00:06:29,329 --> 00:06:33,228
these are not actually their eyes their

163
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:35,329
eyes are up there but the orange and

164
00:06:33,228 --> 00:06:37,758
orange spots make them look like they're

165
00:06:35,329 --> 00:06:39,019
really dangerous but look at the mouth

166
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:40,610
parts I don't know if you can see with

167
00:06:39,019 --> 00:06:42,709
the lights on but the mouth parts go

168
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:44,509
right into the twig but this twig is a

169
00:06:42,709 --> 00:06:47,269
lot woodier then you're going to see

170
00:06:44,509 --> 00:06:49,129
usual plant hoppers feeding on so

171
00:06:47,269 --> 00:06:50,598
they're big they're strong enough to

172
00:06:49,129 --> 00:06:52,520
get their mouthparts into that woody

173
00:06:50,598 --> 00:06:54,110
tissue and then they tap into the flow

174
00:06:52,519 --> 00:06:55,968
they don't actually have very much of a

175
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:58,788
suction but it just kind of sort of

176
00:06:55,968 --> 00:07:03,579
moves through them pretty pretty easily

177
00:06:58,788 --> 00:07:03,579
and the moving through is another issue

178
00:07:03,968 --> 00:07:11,178
I would have pregnant so they produce a

179
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:13,158
huge amount of honeydew oh that's much

180
00:07:11,178 --> 00:07:14,988
better thank you so if you look at this

181
00:07:13,158 --> 00:07:17,058
bottom step that's the one they've

182
00:07:14,988 --> 00:07:19,278
cleaned off the other two still have the

183
00:07:17,059 --> 00:07:22,069
honeydew on them and if you think about

184
00:07:19,278 --> 00:07:24,050
that number of insects in a tree you can

185
00:07:22,069 --> 00:07:29,479
imagine that there's a lot of honeydew

186
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:31,639
see if they can make this work so they

187
00:07:29,478 --> 00:07:33,258
have swarm feeding again they're not

188
00:07:31,639 --> 00:07:34,550
really feeding there's someone on the

189
00:07:33,259 --> 00:07:36,550
fruit but they're not actually attached

190
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:40,069
it's the ones that aren't moving much

191
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:41,509
and you can see this one up here there's

192
00:07:40,069 --> 00:07:43,879
some you can see their mouthparts but

193
00:07:41,509 --> 00:07:47,300
look at that that's the honeydew sorting

194
00:07:43,879 --> 00:07:49,669
out it's like a squirt gun so when

195
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:51,800
you're talking about and that's just one

196
00:07:49,668 --> 00:07:55,248
with that mass of them they're I mean

197
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:57,649
underneath you can see and then you get

198
00:07:55,249 --> 00:08:01,639
City mold developing in them in this in

199
00:07:57,649 --> 00:08:03,468
the honeydew so it can actually help

200
00:08:01,639 --> 00:08:06,379
kill some plants so this is a vineyard

201
00:08:03,468 --> 00:08:08,088
in Pennsylvania and you can see the the

202
00:08:06,379 --> 00:08:09,979
vines here don't look very happy and our

203
00:08:08,088 --> 00:08:12,379
dead actually what they think is the

204
00:08:09,978 --> 00:08:13,699
feeding on the plants affected them

205
00:08:12,379 --> 00:08:15,408
enough that winter that than they were

206
00:08:13,699 --> 00:08:17,658
winter killed so it wasn't that the

207
00:08:15,408 --> 00:08:22,278
insects directly killed them but they

208
00:08:17,658 --> 00:08:24,228
led to their demise and they they do fly

209
00:08:22,278 --> 00:08:25,848
and they move from feeding site to

210
00:08:24,228 --> 00:08:28,639
feeding site so this looks like I

211
00:08:25,848 --> 00:08:30,288
photoshopped spotted Lantern fly in

212
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:31,999
there but actually it's a clip from a

213
00:08:30,288 --> 00:08:34,958
video and all those things that look

214
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:37,129
kind of like birds are actually and

215
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:41,059
they're moving either into or out of

216
00:08:37,129 --> 00:08:42,769
this at large so it's big there's lots

217
00:08:41,059 --> 00:08:45,229
of them and it can move itself around

218
00:08:42,769 --> 00:08:47,028
and also isn't very fussy where it lays

219
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:49,159
eggs again from the point of view of

220
00:08:47,028 --> 00:08:50,720
development of an insect it seems very

221
00:08:49,159 --> 00:08:52,969
odd to put your eggs on something they

222
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:56,149
can't feed on but they like rusty metal

223
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:58,699
and if this this is at the bottom of a

224
00:08:56,149 --> 00:09:00,649
planter so if you you know your great

225
00:08:58,698 --> 00:09:02,429
aunt Agatha gave you a planter to take

226
00:09:00,649 --> 00:09:03,839
back from Pennsylvania you would

227
00:09:02,429 --> 00:09:05,519
necessarily think that that's something

228
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:07,920
you needed to remove it looks like money

229
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:10,230
and that's what they do they cover their

230
00:09:07,919 --> 00:09:11,579
eggs so here's egg masses the eggs are

231
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:14,580
laid and they cover them with kind of

232
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:16,680
this muddy substance and it dries and

233
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:19,259
turns of darker Brown and looks very

234
00:09:16,679 --> 00:09:20,789
much like bark so here's somebody

235
00:09:19,259 --> 00:09:21,059
scraping them we'll talk about that in a

236
00:09:20,789 --> 00:09:24,028
minute

237
00:09:21,059 --> 00:09:26,519
but they lay them on anything that's

238
00:09:24,028 --> 00:09:28,830
outside and they lay a lot of egg masses

239
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:30,629
all at the same time and one or other

240
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:32,700
people other their people other spotted

241
00:09:30,629 --> 00:09:35,789
lanterns I seem to lay them again in the

242
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:37,470
same location and it's a really good

243
00:09:35,789 --> 00:09:39,088
hitchhiker so can you see the numbers

244
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:40,680
here on this tire now at least on the

245
00:09:39,089 --> 00:09:45,540
tire many of them will be run over but

246
00:09:40,679 --> 00:09:47,009
not all of them and so they seem to they

247
00:09:45,539 --> 00:09:49,079
do everything in a group they're not

248
00:09:47,009 --> 00:09:51,689
very they're not great individualist

249
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:53,100
they're doing everything together so if

250
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:54,330
you've got numbers like that trying to

251
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:56,639
make sure that you've cleaned them all

252
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:59,459
off a vehicle before it goes anywhere is

253
00:09:56,639 --> 00:10:02,399
tough so if you think about this

254
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:03,989
location here's Philadelphia think about

255
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:06,778
the transportation that goes through

256
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:08,909
Philadelphia it's amazing and a lot of

257
00:10:06,778 --> 00:10:11,070
it comes door and it comes into New York

258
00:10:08,909 --> 00:10:13,559
State so this actually is another clip

259
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:15,150
from a video but there's a spotted

260
00:10:13,559 --> 00:10:17,489
lantern fly on a tree there's the Train

261
00:10:15,149 --> 00:10:18,480
and if you think about the kind of area

262
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:21,149
around train tracks

263
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:23,490
nobody's managing it very much so it's

264
00:10:21,149 --> 00:10:25,409
and it was going pretty slowly it would

265
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:27,539
be easy enough for a spotted lantern

266
00:10:25,409 --> 00:10:29,490
flag adult to hop on and find a place

267
00:10:27,539 --> 00:10:31,860
where it didn't get blown off and move

268
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:35,039
in fact the reason I said in boats too

269
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:37,709
is there was a boat that came from

270
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:39,329
Philadelphia Harbor into New York and it

271
00:10:37,708 --> 00:10:41,699
was quarantined before I was allowed to

272
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:43,680
land but to dock because they found

273
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:45,690
spotted Lantern flight on the boat and

274
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:48,750
they had to they had to clean it up

275
00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:51,660
before they would let it dock so it can

276
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:53,610
come in lots of ways it's very easy for

277
00:10:51,659 --> 00:10:55,500
it to hide in places I think with the

278
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:57,120
Christmas trees what we think is they

279
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:59,100
actually liked that the adults were all

280
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:01,200
dead but they seem to crawl into the

281
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:03,720
wrapping so they also seem to like to be

282
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:06,778
in sort of tight places which also makes

283
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:10,200
it harder to find them so okay are you

284
00:11:06,778 --> 00:11:11,610
all scared now it's it was in the that's

285
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:14,240
the reason to why we believe it is

286
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:14,240
definitely coming

287
00:11:15,269 --> 00:11:20,949
so here's the why here's about the host

288
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:22,480
range and I think this is what we know

289
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:23,500
and every time I see a list it's got

290
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:25,600
more things on it

291
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:27,639
at first it was mostly trees and shrubs

292
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,409
now we're seeing things like basil and

293
00:11:27,639 --> 00:11:32,080
cucumbers and soybeans and status and

294
00:11:29,409 --> 00:11:33,789
lots and lots of other things but

295
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:36,400
there's also this difference between

296
00:11:33,789 --> 00:11:39,490
what it's feeding on and what it's

297
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:43,269
laying its eggs on it lays its eggs on

298
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:44,950
lots of stuff so we have had one case of

299
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:47,649
an egg mass coming in on nursery stock

300
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:49,210
into Long Island we had as well as we've

301
00:11:47,649 --> 00:11:50,559
had I'm sure we've had other cases of

302
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:53,680
things coming in that's the one that

303
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:55,479
I've heard of but so the Christmas trees

304
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:57,099
you don't see anything that's what we

305
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:59,590
use is Christmas trees on this host

306
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:01,659
range list but it will lay its eggs on

307
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:03,100
Christmas tree bark and that's one thing

308
00:12:01,659 --> 00:12:05,110
we're worried about because who's

309
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:07,389
looking for the egg masses hopefully the

310
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:08,620
growers are but once they're in this so

311
00:12:07,389 --> 00:12:10,480
once you have them you bring it in your

312
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:12,070
house actually would be an advantage if

313
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,870
the egg mass would hatch it would freak

314
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:15,400
people out and we'd hear screaming so I

315
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:16,629
don't think it's happened yet but the

316
00:12:15,399 --> 00:12:18,069
problem is you keep it in your house a

317
00:12:16,629 --> 00:12:19,480
little bit of time and then you throw it

318
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:21,220
out now you've got an egg mass that's

319
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:23,200
sitting outside the eggs aren't killed

320
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:23,800
by the cold and they will hatch out at

321
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,710
some point

322
00:12:23,799 --> 00:12:28,750
so the feeding the feeding versus

323
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:30,310
egg-laying has some importance both for

324
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:32,080
moving it around and then also for the

325
00:12:30,309 --> 00:12:34,899
damage that's likely likely to call

326
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:37,270
cause so even where pebbles are one of

327
00:12:34,899 --> 00:12:38,470
the more or less preferred hosts part of

328
00:12:37,269 --> 00:12:40,179
the problem is not that they're feeding

329
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:42,370
on the maple but that they're dropping

330
00:12:40,179 --> 00:12:46,509
honeydew down below and it's in

331
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:47,980
landscape settings so they dothey we

332
00:12:46,509 --> 00:12:50,289
know a little bit about them Tree of

333
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:52,360
Heaven is a preferred host as it showed

334
00:12:50,289 --> 00:12:54,789
before that's that's we think it's

335
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:56,320
required a required host we also think

336
00:12:54,789 --> 00:12:58,719
that's the reason that they things don't

337
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:00,820
eat them because they acquire a toxin

338
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:02,649
from feeding on Tree of Heaven so they

339
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:04,360
don't taste good and if you saw the

340
00:13:02,649 --> 00:13:05,799
picture of the insect I'm gonna give you

341
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:07,060
an entomology quiz now what's the one

342
00:13:05,799 --> 00:13:08,319
thing about the picture of the insect

343
00:13:07,059 --> 00:13:11,439
which might let you believe that it

344
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:13,870
doesn't taste good it's red yep so

345
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:15,670
they're red so Tree of Heaven they seem

346
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:17,169
to be on anytime grapes they seem to be

347
00:13:15,669 --> 00:13:19,839
on anytime both wild and cultivated

348
00:13:17,169 --> 00:13:21,729
grape but there is a preference for

349
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:24,700
fourth instar through adults for the

350
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:26,440
Tree of Heaven so it makes it one

351
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:28,269
advantage on that is that you can use

352
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:30,999
Tree of Heaven as a place to go scout

353
00:13:28,269 --> 00:13:32,470
potentially treat the insect and they've

354
00:13:30,999 --> 00:13:35,079
they're seeing that they sort of move

355
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:37,149
over time so on some things like rows

356
00:13:35,078 --> 00:13:38,979
you find the nymphs but you don't see

357
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:40,328
the adults there and there seems to be

358
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:42,670
some preference for the late-season

359
00:13:40,328 --> 00:13:45,368
adults for things like silver maple and

360
00:13:42,669 --> 00:13:47,078
Willow so again everything that we know

361
00:13:45,369 --> 00:13:48,550
we know a little bit and we may find out

362
00:13:47,078 --> 00:13:49,928
more information as I said the

363
00:13:48,549 --> 00:13:52,240
Pennsylvania Pennsylvania they're doing

364
00:13:49,928 --> 00:13:53,649
a lot of research on it we're not doing

365
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,639
quite so much here because we don't have

366
00:13:53,649 --> 00:13:56,589
it and we don't want to bring it in

367
00:13:54,639 --> 00:14:00,249
there is some research that's going on

368
00:13:56,589 --> 00:14:02,110
in New York State though so what should

369
00:14:00,249 --> 00:14:03,999
we be doing about it

370
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:05,318
learn to identify it is the first thing

371
00:14:03,999 --> 00:14:07,778
that's kind of why I'm doing this

372
00:14:05,318 --> 00:14:09,009
presentation one is many of you had

373
00:14:07,778 --> 00:14:11,019
heard about it would you have been able

374
00:14:09,009 --> 00:14:12,909
to identify it before I gave the talk

375
00:14:11,019 --> 00:14:14,889
got some nodding and we've got some know

376
00:14:12,909 --> 00:14:17,799
so at least there's a reason to do this

377
00:14:14,889 --> 00:14:20,110
talk so we're learning to identify and

378
00:14:17,799 --> 00:14:22,389
looking for it is one thing that we can

379
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:24,278
do doing in New York State so again the

380
00:14:22,389 --> 00:14:26,919
life stages they're big and they're

381
00:14:24,278 --> 00:14:28,629
beautiful and that maybe helps I don't

382
00:14:26,919 --> 00:14:30,610
know but it's the egg masses that I

383
00:14:28,629 --> 00:14:33,240
think are the hard part to find just

384
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:35,289
because they're meant to be cryptic and

385
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:36,818
again I think I showed you so you can

386
00:14:35,289 --> 00:14:38,498
see the eggs and then they get covered

387
00:14:36,818 --> 00:14:40,990
with the mud and then the mud often

388
00:14:38,499 --> 00:14:43,209
turns brown they you won't find all

389
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:45,909
stages all the time so the life cycle

390
00:14:43,208 --> 00:14:48,669
has some importance in terms of

391
00:14:45,909 --> 00:14:51,009
identifying it and looking for it to

392
00:14:48,669 --> 00:14:52,208
know what you're looking for so eggs are

393
00:14:51,009 --> 00:14:53,740
there for a long time they actually

394
00:14:52,208 --> 00:14:55,539
start laying eggs in September and they

395
00:14:53,740 --> 00:15:00,009
can be there all the way through June so

396
00:14:55,539 --> 00:15:02,078
that's before they start hatching out

397
00:15:00,009 --> 00:15:03,699
then you get the first instars hatching

398
00:15:02,078 --> 00:15:06,578
out in the spring and you don't get

399
00:15:03,698 --> 00:15:08,588
forth in stars and the adults until and

400
00:15:06,578 --> 00:15:10,448
then the adults it shows that it says

401
00:15:08,589 --> 00:15:12,279
July to December they are killed by the

402
00:15:10,448 --> 00:15:14,548
cold temperatures but if it's warm

403
00:15:12,278 --> 00:15:17,678
enough they will stick around that long

404
00:15:14,548 --> 00:15:19,149
so this is based on Pennsylvania so it's

405
00:15:17,678 --> 00:15:22,778
going to be similar to what we would see

406
00:15:19,149 --> 00:15:24,220
here we think but there's always just

407
00:15:22,778 --> 00:15:25,958
enough difference that's one of them

408
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:30,970
good nose points that I'll get to at the

409
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:32,678
end so what to look for honey do wasps

410
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:34,660
and bees feeding on the honey do the

411
00:15:32,678 --> 00:15:36,610
black city mold on the honey do you can

412
00:15:34,659 --> 00:15:38,889
actually see this is a terrible slide

413
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:40,539
but there's a group of spotted lantern

414
00:15:38,889 --> 00:15:41,808
fly here in this trunk and then you can

415
00:15:40,539 --> 00:15:43,998
see that it's

416
00:15:41,808 --> 00:15:45,438
so that's again will help you do get

417
00:15:43,999 --> 00:15:47,720
some flight and get flagging on the

418
00:15:45,438 --> 00:15:48,980
branches but of course we get flagging

419
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:50,269
on branches for other reasons so you

420
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:52,519
need to go look to make sure that this

421
00:15:50,269 --> 00:15:54,948
flagging is actually caused by spotted

422
00:15:52,519 --> 00:15:57,409
lanterns life can most time us turn and

423
00:15:54,948 --> 00:16:00,428
all of a sudden that sounds very loud so

424
00:15:57,409 --> 00:16:02,749
hopefully I'm not blasting interview up

425
00:16:00,428 --> 00:16:04,578
now if you're looking for information on

426
00:16:02,749 --> 00:16:06,739
identification or lots of other pieces

427
00:16:04,578 --> 00:16:09,378
New York State IPM has a lot on our

428
00:16:06,739 --> 00:16:11,839
website and we're one of the partners in

429
00:16:09,379 --> 00:16:15,470
the in New York State sort of plan of

430
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:17,569
attack for spotted lantern fly and so as

431
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:19,879
I said the most current map is always on

432
00:16:17,568 --> 00:16:21,259
our website and there's other things

433
00:16:19,879 --> 00:16:23,178
anytime something comes up it usually

434
00:16:21,259 --> 00:16:23,688
gets added here and then we create some

435
00:16:23,178 --> 00:16:27,108
of it also

436
00:16:23,688 --> 00:16:31,730
so NYS IPM that Cornell dot edu that's

437
00:16:27,109 --> 00:16:34,220
us sorry NYS IPM at Cornell dd no extra

438
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:36,048
dot another thing that we can learn to

439
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:38,509
do is identify Tree of Heaven how many

440
00:16:36,048 --> 00:16:41,448
people can identify tree of heaven I'm

441
00:16:38,509 --> 00:16:43,220
glad to see the police should be able to

442
00:16:41,448 --> 00:16:46,088
identify it how many of them do we have

443
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:50,028
some in the Botanic Gardens undoubtedly

444
00:16:46,089 --> 00:16:51,739
there there are many many places and so

445
00:16:50,028 --> 00:16:53,629
one of the things to look for when the

446
00:16:51,739 --> 00:16:55,819
seeds are on it's pretty easy it's a

447
00:16:53,629 --> 00:16:56,959
compound leaf so that's a little there

448
00:16:55,818 --> 00:16:58,668
are some things other things that look

449
00:16:56,958 --> 00:17:01,638
like it but very few things have this

450
00:16:58,668 --> 00:17:03,588
little node so that's one of the

451
00:17:01,639 --> 00:17:06,349
indicators it's also reported to smell

452
00:17:03,589 --> 00:17:09,078
like rancid peanut butter rancid other

453
00:17:06,349 --> 00:17:13,359
things feet I've heard so if you're out

454
00:17:09,078 --> 00:17:18,918
walking around and you smell feet look

455
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:21,019
sinking tree so that's so that's one

456
00:17:18,919 --> 00:17:23,600
thing is to identify where they are and

457
00:17:21,019 --> 00:17:25,278
then map actually mapping them and if

458
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:27,198
you can get rid of them

459
00:17:25,278 --> 00:17:29,119
that's a good thing too now this is a

460
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:31,210
nice specimen tree no one's going to not

461
00:17:29,119 --> 00:17:33,859
very likely go out there and cut it down

462
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:35,450
so that one you may not take out if

463
00:17:33,859 --> 00:17:38,329
they're if you're in a more wild area or

464
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:40,038
woody edges you might actually try and

465
00:17:38,329 --> 00:17:41,960
remove them they are fairly hard to kill

466
00:17:40,038 --> 00:17:43,700
you can't just cut them down as you'll

467
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:45,110
have more so they do what they call the

468
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:48,139
hack and squirt method where you cut

469
00:17:45,109 --> 00:17:50,119
into essentially just under the bark and

470
00:17:48,138 --> 00:17:51,949
then you apply the herbicide there and

471
00:17:50,119 --> 00:17:53,148
that will kill the tree if you're going

472
00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:55,500
to kill if you're only going to kill one

473
00:17:53,148 --> 00:17:56,939
kill them female

474
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:59,069
but that's because they're producing

475
00:17:56,940 --> 00:18:01,380
seeds and they're very good invasive and

476
00:17:59,069 --> 00:18:03,990
they will grow more of trees from seeds

477
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:05,250
so if you can if you can get rid of the

478
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:06,900
females even if you leave the males

479
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:08,579
that's still an advantage and then

480
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:11,100
anything that's left is used as a place

481
00:18:08,579 --> 00:18:13,259
to scout so because they have to be

482
00:18:11,099 --> 00:18:15,178
there and especially when the adults are

483
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:17,039
out you can go look at those trees or

484
00:18:15,179 --> 00:18:19,320
actually put sticky traps on those trees

485
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:21,990
to see if you're finding any spotted

486
00:18:19,319 --> 00:18:23,548
lantern fly and so when they're when

487
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:25,079
they found it when we've had areas where

488
00:18:23,548 --> 00:18:27,480
they found some they do a lot of this

489
00:18:25,079 --> 00:18:29,759
around the areas it's go Scout the the

490
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:33,289
Tree of Heaven and do other things to

491
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:33,289
make sure that there is not a population

492
00:18:37,009 --> 00:18:42,419
well that's again yes it was that going

493
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:43,889
to get rid of the problem know it but

494
00:18:42,419 --> 00:18:46,620
because they tend to be an attractive

495
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:48,210
thing where it'll pull them in they

496
00:18:46,619 --> 00:18:50,668
they're actually using them as trap

497
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:51,960
trees so you keep some and get rid of

498
00:18:50,669 --> 00:18:53,640
the others and that way it makes it

499
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:56,340
easier you could treat the ones that are

500
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:57,900
left with a systemic pesticide and then

501
00:18:56,339 --> 00:19:00,720
that's a way to and that seems to work

502
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:03,269
on controlling spotted lantern fly it's

503
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:04,980
a good way to get get the control with

504
00:19:03,269 --> 00:19:07,980
using the least amount of pesticide also

505
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:09,808
so at this point I mean if if you can

506
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:11,730
get rid of some of them so that you're

507
00:19:09,808 --> 00:19:13,980
not trying to you know having to scout

508
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:15,599
all of them that also helps yes its and

509
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:16,798
it's one thing to say that when we don't

510
00:19:15,599 --> 00:19:18,769
have it yet it's like well I'll wait

511
00:19:16,798 --> 00:19:24,539
till they get here then that's

512
00:19:18,769 --> 00:19:26,099
understandable apparently they seem to

513
00:19:24,539 --> 00:19:29,129
like that they are preferred and they

514
00:19:26,099 --> 00:19:32,789
seem to have to feed on them so in

515
00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:34,890
Alaska well I say that as far as we know

516
00:19:32,789 --> 00:19:36,298
and so for example if you have them they

517
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:37,650
come into and there's maples around and

518
00:19:36,298 --> 00:19:39,839
they're happy on the maples they may not

519
00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:42,030
immediately move to the spot to the Tree

520
00:19:39,839 --> 00:19:43,769
of Heaven so but it is in terms of a

521
00:19:42,029 --> 00:19:45,690
place that they seem to require feeding

522
00:19:43,769 --> 00:19:48,539
there that they will eventually end up

523
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:50,340
there so if you find anything that you

524
00:19:48,539 --> 00:19:51,659
think might be spotted Lantern fly even

525
00:19:50,339 --> 00:19:53,639
if you're not quite sure and you might

526
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:55,980
be wrong still scrape eggs into the

527
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:57,630
handset hand sanitizer alcohol if you

528
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:59,789
can catch the other stages put them in

529
00:19:57,630 --> 00:20:01,470
alcohol or freeze them the nymphs and

530
00:19:59,789 --> 00:20:02,849
the second and the fourth end stars just

531
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:04,798
run they don't jump so they're a little

532
00:20:02,849 --> 00:20:06,808
bit easier to catch pretty fast though

533
00:20:04,798 --> 00:20:08,960
and then you can send pictures and the

534
00:20:06,808 --> 00:20:11,210
location information to

535
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:13,579
lantern fly at agriculture New York gov

536
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:15,590
some of the older information says Dec

537
00:20:13,579 --> 00:20:17,509
because Dec was originally the spot to

538
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:21,769
send them to now it's the Department of

539
00:20:17,509 --> 00:20:23,658
Ag and markets so now we also have an

540
00:20:21,769 --> 00:20:32,298
external quarantine and what's like

541
00:20:23,659 --> 00:20:34,880
what's a quarantine these days it has to

542
00:20:32,298 --> 00:20:36,440
do with tour boats that's right in this

543
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:38,000
case we have an external quarantine

544
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:39,620
because we don't have them yet so what

545
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,500
we have is a quarantine that's that's

546
00:20:39,619 --> 00:20:45,139
limiting access to movement of things

547
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:46,398
from someplace into New York so anywhere

548
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:47,600
that has a red line around that's

549
00:20:46,398 --> 00:20:49,398
interesting there are some places that

550
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:50,898
they know they have populations that are

551
00:20:49,398 --> 00:20:52,519
not yet in our quarantine but that

552
00:20:50,898 --> 00:20:54,469
everyone is but most of Pennsylvania

553
00:20:52,519 --> 00:20:55,849
most of the other sites it's some of

554
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:56,960
these areas of New Jersey that we're

555
00:20:55,849 --> 00:20:58,908
kind of worried about cuz they're pretty

556
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:02,269
close and I think they've maybe found

557
00:20:58,909 --> 00:21:04,490
some even closer to New York but so it's

558
00:21:02,269 --> 00:21:06,500
an external quarantine that means that

559
00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:08,778
you have to consider what's happened to

560
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:10,940
what's moving through that area any of

561
00:21:08,778 --> 00:21:11,960
those areas into New York State so how

562
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:14,210
do you know where it is if you're in

563
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:15,798
Pennsylvania actually the Pennsylvania

564
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:18,110
Department of Agriculture has this

565
00:21:15,798 --> 00:21:20,359
website if you look goo GLE them and and

566
00:21:18,109 --> 00:21:22,219
put under put it in spotted lantern fly

567
00:21:20,359 --> 00:21:24,678
in quarantine though there's a button

568
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:26,509
for an interactive map and the address

569
00:21:24,679 --> 00:21:28,850
and it will pop up whether or not it's

570
00:21:26,509 --> 00:21:29,869
in the quarantine zone or not so it's

571
00:21:28,849 --> 00:21:32,298
like well that seems like kind of

572
00:21:29,869 --> 00:21:33,619
overkill I'm just going on vacation but

573
00:21:32,298 --> 00:21:36,230
you can bring them back from being on

574
00:21:33,619 --> 00:21:42,288
vacation as well so that's actually

575
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:43,788
Brian our parents house so if you're a

576
00:21:42,288 --> 00:21:45,740
commercial business and you're bringing

577
00:21:43,788 --> 00:21:47,929
anything in not just if you're doing the

578
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:49,548
trucking but if anything is coming in

579
00:21:47,929 --> 00:21:51,259
and again this Christmas tree issue is

580
00:21:49,548 --> 00:21:53,298
one of them so if you're bringing in

581
00:21:51,259 --> 00:21:55,940
anything the regulated articles include

582
00:21:53,298 --> 00:21:58,038
all plants and plant parts any stage of

583
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:59,750
the insect and anything reasonably

584
00:21:58,038 --> 00:22:01,490
believed to be infested with or

585
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:03,859
harboring that's like anything that

586
00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:06,679
might be sitting outside vehicles

587
00:22:03,859 --> 00:22:09,139
everything else and all plant parts and

588
00:22:06,679 --> 00:22:10,750
any kind of any stage of the insect so

589
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:11,899
it's a broad it's a very broad

590
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:13,429
quarantine

591
00:22:11,898 --> 00:22:15,709
sometimes in quarantines we say you

592
00:22:13,429 --> 00:22:17,298
can't bring anything that would you know

593
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:19,429
like you can't bring this fruit in or

594
00:22:17,298 --> 00:22:21,558
you can't bring this plant in if we did

595
00:22:19,429 --> 00:22:22,880
this we would actually stop all commerce

596
00:22:21,558 --> 00:22:24,319
because essentially

597
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:27,290
anything that's outside it could be on

598
00:22:24,319 --> 00:22:30,049
so instead of saying you can't bring it

599
00:22:27,289 --> 00:22:32,029
if you if you have any of those articles

600
00:22:30,049 --> 00:22:34,250
you have to have a certificate of

601
00:22:32,029 --> 00:22:36,710
inspection you have to have a way bill

602
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:38,299
with where it originated and where it's

603
00:22:36,710 --> 00:22:39,740
supposed to be going and the companies

604
00:22:38,299 --> 00:22:41,569
that you're buying from are supposed to

605
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:42,799
provide those and then you should know

606
00:22:41,569 --> 00:22:45,829
something about how it was shipped and

607
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:47,419
loaded and everything else so again

608
00:22:45,829 --> 00:22:48,740
there's the the link from for the

609
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:50,529
department and egged markets they have a

610
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:53,690
lot of information on this quarantine

611
00:22:50,529 --> 00:22:55,970
but so this is an issue that does affect

612
00:22:53,690 --> 00:22:57,799
New York growers and other people that

613
00:22:55,970 --> 00:22:59,420
are bringing plant material so I've

614
00:22:57,799 --> 00:23:01,279
already had a call from somebody growing

615
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:02,960
blueberries who wanted to know if it was

616
00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:04,129
okay I don't even work on blueberries

617
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:06,110
but what I wanted to know if it was okay

618
00:23:04,130 --> 00:23:07,550
to bring in blueberry plants from

619
00:23:06,109 --> 00:23:09,079
Pennsylvania and I said well certainly

620
00:23:07,549 --> 00:23:11,059
just inspect them make sure that they

621
00:23:09,079 --> 00:23:13,549
he's like no I can't do it I have to get

622
00:23:11,059 --> 00:23:15,440
them from Maine now so that's the small

623
00:23:13,549 --> 00:23:17,809
example but I suspect that means that we

624
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:20,809
are seeing economic effects and we'll

625
00:23:17,809 --> 00:23:23,089
see more as they come along this is one

626
00:23:20,809 --> 00:23:24,559
on the d-o-t inspection spots so if you

627
00:23:23,089 --> 00:23:26,089
can see that and they're stopping trucks

628
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:27,919
they're stopping they're starving

629
00:23:26,089 --> 00:23:29,509
vehicles along the roads coming in from

630
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:32,150
Pennsylvania and actually inspecting

631
00:23:29,509 --> 00:23:34,309
them if you have they have splatted the

632
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:37,910
spot Atlanta fly sniffing dogs also

633
00:23:34,309 --> 00:23:39,619
which is pretty cool so if it's a

634
00:23:37,910 --> 00:23:41,570
personal trip the thing is if you're

635
00:23:39,619 --> 00:23:44,419
gonna be driving through the quarantine

636
00:23:41,569 --> 00:23:46,909
zone don't stop if you don't have to if

637
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:49,430
you do look check your vehicle inside

638
00:23:46,910 --> 00:23:50,810
and out they like to get inside cars for

639
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:52,789
some reason and I know someone was

640
00:23:50,809 --> 00:23:54,529
scouting I was a scout that was writing

641
00:23:52,789 --> 00:23:57,139
an article and they said yep they

642
00:23:54,529 --> 00:23:58,700
stopped at the gas station and they were

643
00:23:57,140 --> 00:24:00,710
just about to go into Maryland before it

644
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:02,330
was in Maryland and just look in their

645
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:04,549
trunk and one had climbed in the trunk

646
00:24:02,329 --> 00:24:06,619
so they for some reason like like to go

647
00:24:04,549 --> 00:24:08,359
visiting and if you're moving anything

648
00:24:06,619 --> 00:24:10,849
that's been left outside inspected

649
00:24:08,359 --> 00:24:12,619
especially for the egg masses so they're

650
00:24:10,849 --> 00:24:14,149
starting to put out again documents like

651
00:24:12,619 --> 00:24:15,769
this looking at the plants and plant

652
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:17,900
parts but looking at packing material

653
00:24:15,769 --> 00:24:21,170
looking at landscape materials looking

654
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:23,570
anything that's the left outside and you

655
00:24:21,170 --> 00:24:24,710
can even if you're a public citizen but

656
00:24:23,569 --> 00:24:27,439
you happen to go in and out of

657
00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:29,569
Pennsylvania a lot you can get a permit

658
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:30,740
it's pretty easy online trainings get

659
00:24:29,569 --> 00:24:33,678
the permit if

660
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:36,679
I was people from Pennsylvania were

661
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:37,820
speaking for us and they said yeah they

662
00:24:36,679 --> 00:24:39,320
had to make so many that they don't even

663
00:24:37,819 --> 00:24:41,119
have nice plastic ones now they're just

664
00:24:39,319 --> 00:24:45,558
paper cuz there were so many that the

665
00:24:41,119 --> 00:24:48,079
people are requesting so are we ready in

666
00:24:45,558 --> 00:24:49,129
New York State I think we are as ready

667
00:24:48,079 --> 00:24:50,539
as we can be

668
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:53,450
they actually created something called

669
00:24:50,539 --> 00:24:56,089
an incident command group just like a

670
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:57,830
like for battles where they brought in

671
00:24:56,089 --> 00:25:01,308
all these collaborators egg and markets

672
00:24:57,829 --> 00:25:02,689
Dec parks other people to say alright

673
00:25:01,308 --> 00:25:04,369
what do you need to know what who's

674
00:25:02,690 --> 00:25:06,950
doing what piece what do we need to know

675
00:25:04,369 --> 00:25:08,719
and what do we need to do so we have

676
00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:10,100
this concept of protective zones if they

677
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:11,839
found any stage that will make a

678
00:25:10,099 --> 00:25:13,308
protective zone around it and check very

679
00:25:11,839 --> 00:25:15,619
heavily to see if there are any

680
00:25:13,308 --> 00:25:17,509
populations there they have the

681
00:25:15,619 --> 00:25:19,339
checkpoints on the roads that we

682
00:25:17,509 --> 00:25:21,799
actually do have lists of - double e

683
00:25:19,339 --> 00:25:23,689
lists of pesticides already the labels

684
00:25:21,799 --> 00:25:25,220
are already ready they're not out yet

685
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:27,500
because we don't have the insect but as

686
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:29,569
soon as the insect is determined to be

687
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:30,829
here then those will become available so

688
00:25:29,569 --> 00:25:32,779
that it we don't do wait because it

689
00:25:30,829 --> 00:25:35,928
often takes a little bit of time to get

690
00:25:32,779 --> 00:25:37,970
a special special needs permit for our

691
00:25:35,929 --> 00:25:39,800
license I'm sorry not license but label

692
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:41,990
for a pesticide so this way they're

693
00:25:39,799 --> 00:25:43,549
already ready to go and they are looking

694
00:25:41,990 --> 00:25:45,079
at those for secondary effects on

695
00:25:43,549 --> 00:25:47,359
pollinators because we're trying not to

696
00:25:45,079 --> 00:25:49,460
cause harm when the process of causing

697
00:25:47,359 --> 00:25:50,869
good and then we're looking at this

698
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:52,970
concept of training for management

699
00:25:50,869 --> 00:25:54,319
methods I have some handouts up here

700
00:25:52,970 --> 00:25:56,450
that are from Pennsylvania that have a

701
00:25:54,319 --> 00:25:58,099
lot of the information on how to manage

702
00:25:56,450 --> 00:25:59,420
them and how to look for them and so

703
00:25:58,099 --> 00:26:03,129
forth so if anyone's interested and

704
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:05,269
bumper stickers there's a lot of swag

705
00:26:03,130 --> 00:26:06,890
Pennsylvania is doing as I said a lot of

706
00:26:05,269 --> 00:26:09,500
research and they're sharing all of it

707
00:26:06,890 --> 00:26:11,120
which is very very helpful so this is

708
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:13,519
one of their management calendars that

709
00:26:11,119 --> 00:26:15,169
they've created but they're also doing

710
00:26:13,519 --> 00:26:17,389
research on a lot of the different

711
00:26:15,170 --> 00:26:18,620
things not just management methods but

712
00:26:17,390 --> 00:26:19,940
biology and movement

713
00:26:18,619 --> 00:26:22,339
what's it one of the effects on

714
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:25,370
different host insecticide trials are

715
00:26:22,339 --> 00:26:28,699
there pheromones we create traps so make

716
00:26:25,369 --> 00:26:30,619
it easier to catch them so and more

717
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:32,029
there's a they have if you ever get a

718
00:26:30,619 --> 00:26:33,829
chance to hear the groups from

719
00:26:32,029 --> 00:26:35,420
Pennsylvania speak they have just

720
00:26:33,829 --> 00:26:39,769
amazing amounts of work that they're

721
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:41,929
doing and and I'm really helpful so is

722
00:26:39,769 --> 00:26:44,388
there good news

723
00:26:41,929 --> 00:26:45,798
I think they don't bite they don't sting

724
00:26:44,388 --> 00:26:47,719
and they're not structural pests and

725
00:26:45,798 --> 00:26:49,668
they're not here yet those are all good

726
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:51,558
those are all points of good news but I

727
00:26:49,669 --> 00:26:53,480
think there's even more so there are

728
00:26:51,558 --> 00:26:54,618
some things that will eat them now when

729
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:55,940
you look at the numbers it's very

730
00:26:54,618 --> 00:26:57,859
unlikely that you're going to have a

731
00:26:55,940 --> 00:27:00,139
good biological control for that many

732
00:26:57,859 --> 00:27:02,148
insects in one place have something eat

733
00:27:00,138 --> 00:27:04,008
them all but there are some that are

734
00:27:02,148 --> 00:27:06,258
being fed on so anyone that's gone I

735
00:27:04,009 --> 00:27:09,589
suspect is that that helps not laying

736
00:27:06,259 --> 00:27:11,569
eggs there is some biological control

737
00:27:09,589 --> 00:27:13,730
they found that they paired the egg

738
00:27:11,569 --> 00:27:16,249
parasitoid for gypsy moth actually was

739
00:27:13,730 --> 00:27:18,528
found infesting spotted lantern fly eggs

740
00:27:16,249 --> 00:27:20,440
and they've got two additional ones from

741
00:27:18,528 --> 00:27:22,878
China that are in quarantine for

742
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:24,590
potential release but what's something

743
00:27:22,878 --> 00:27:29,418
about these egg masses that you notice

744
00:27:24,589 --> 00:27:36,230
it looks different yes tell if you've

745
00:27:29,419 --> 00:27:38,538
been paying attention yep yep so they

746
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:40,999
lay eggs one in rows that's how they lay

747
00:27:38,538 --> 00:27:43,579
them is there something missing there's

748
00:27:40,999 --> 00:27:45,679
no mud so once they're covered with mud

749
00:27:43,579 --> 00:27:47,599
they're less likely to be attacked by an

750
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:50,240
egg parasitoid so this is a little wasp

751
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:51,678
it lays its egg into the egg it lays its

752
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:54,138
egg into the inside the egg of the

753
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:55,850
spotted lantern fly so they don't always

754
00:27:54,138 --> 00:27:58,519
get them all covered but most of them

755
00:27:55,849 --> 00:27:59,808
are so again that has some potential and

756
00:27:58,519 --> 00:28:03,169
they found I think

757
00:27:59,808 --> 00:28:05,690
levels of maybe 20% infestation but not

758
00:28:03,169 --> 00:28:23,419
enough to give you good control these

759
00:28:05,690 --> 00:28:25,340
are my favorite though not that I know

760
00:28:23,419 --> 00:28:28,490
but that's a good point he was asking if

761
00:28:25,339 --> 00:28:30,319
there's been any study of the of the mud

762
00:28:28,490 --> 00:28:31,839
and the chemical composition of the mud

763
00:28:30,319 --> 00:28:33,888
and so whether or not that's actually

764
00:28:31,839 --> 00:28:35,959
repelling the insects or it's just a

765
00:28:33,888 --> 00:28:38,508
physical process but they can't lay an

766
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:40,129
egg through it I think all of that is up

767
00:28:38,509 --> 00:28:42,618
for grabs now there's research also

768
00:28:40,128 --> 00:28:44,058
going on in Korea and in China they're

769
00:28:42,618 --> 00:28:46,638
under control because they've got the

770
00:28:44,058 --> 00:28:47,808
national enemies and so this is a work

771
00:28:46,638 --> 00:28:50,868
and actually this is some of the work

772
00:28:47,808 --> 00:28:53,480
that's being done and it Cornell is on

773
00:28:50,868 --> 00:28:55,429
the biological biological or intima

774
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:57,140
pathogenic fungi actually so

775
00:28:55,430 --> 00:29:00,259
the first one is Bavaria bastiana so you

776
00:28:57,140 --> 00:29:02,900
can see a nicely fuzzy adult there so

777
00:29:00,259 --> 00:29:04,129
it's infected with the fungus and from

778
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:05,950
what I know about malaria bassiano

779
00:29:04,130 --> 00:29:08,390
because it is one of the one of the

780
00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:09,860
pathogens that we use in greenhouse

781
00:29:08,390 --> 00:29:11,570
production so it's currently being

782
00:29:09,859 --> 00:29:13,909
produced commercially so you can

783
00:29:11,569 --> 00:29:15,799
actually buy it and apply it in some

784
00:29:13,910 --> 00:29:18,230
insects they shed their skins too fast

785
00:29:15,799 --> 00:29:20,149
and so they kind of Slough it off so

786
00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:23,120
they're not infected this has got a long

787
00:29:20,150 --> 00:29:24,500
period of development and so I think

788
00:29:23,119 --> 00:29:27,199
it's one where it actually can be

789
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:28,819
controlled and you can get some killing

790
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:31,700
of the insect with the Bavaria bus

791
00:29:28,819 --> 00:29:33,529
Asiata so it just infects the the body

792
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:35,360
and kills the insect this one is my

793
00:29:33,529 --> 00:29:37,789
favorite though this Beko a major and

794
00:29:35,359 --> 00:29:40,219
it's native they found it being infected

795
00:29:37,789 --> 00:29:43,250
in Pennsylvania so you notice this one

796
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:44,750
has its wings outspread and you also can

797
00:29:43,250 --> 00:29:47,299
maybe see there are little fungal

798
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:49,730
strands that attach it to that leaf so

799
00:29:47,299 --> 00:29:51,559
the fungus infects the insect it

800
00:29:49,730 --> 00:29:53,059
actually makes it climb up higher than

801
00:29:51,559 --> 00:29:56,359
normal so now it's above at the

802
00:29:53,059 --> 00:29:59,329
population below causes it to open its

803
00:29:56,359 --> 00:30:00,679
wings and attaches it to the plant with

804
00:29:59,329 --> 00:30:02,599
these little fungal strands so it

805
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:05,180
doesn't fall off so there's a rain of

806
00:30:02,599 --> 00:30:09,649
spores falling down on the ones on the

807
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:12,440
adults below but it's pretty amazing to

808
00:30:09,650 --> 00:30:15,500
be that that's what the fungus can do to

809
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:17,090
the insect so so that one again looks

810
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:19,640
like that's native but not commercially

811
00:30:17,089 --> 00:30:21,139
available so it has some potential so

812
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:23,120
they're actually trying spraying and

813
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:24,590
spraying a very bossy ana to see if they

814
00:30:23,119 --> 00:30:27,619
can get control but the Beco and they

815
00:30:24,589 --> 00:30:29,389
have to do more work on so the other

816
00:30:27,619 --> 00:30:32,689
thing that has some potential good news

817
00:30:29,390 --> 00:30:34,430
is so the adults will die with the cold

818
00:30:32,690 --> 00:30:35,990
the eggs survive but there's a something

819
00:30:34,430 --> 00:30:37,549
they're looking at the concept of

820
00:30:35,990 --> 00:30:40,039
growing degree days many people know

821
00:30:37,549 --> 00:30:41,690
what growing degree days are few so the

822
00:30:40,039 --> 00:30:43,609
idea of you need a certain amount of

823
00:30:41,690 --> 00:30:45,860
temperature to go through the stages of

824
00:30:43,609 --> 00:30:47,479
development of the insect and if there's

825
00:30:45,859 --> 00:30:49,609
not enough temperature and not enough

826
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:51,259
heat units they won't go all the way

827
00:30:49,609 --> 00:30:53,299
through development so there's some

828
00:30:51,259 --> 00:30:55,009
indication that that in parts of New

829
00:30:53,299 --> 00:30:56,389
York State at any rate there are not

830
00:30:55,009 --> 00:30:58,099
enough growing degree days for the

831
00:30:56,390 --> 00:31:00,110
insect to complete its life cycle and

832
00:30:58,099 --> 00:31:02,509
that might halt so you'll have either

833
00:31:00,109 --> 00:31:04,129
fewer or no eggs laid so that's a good

834
00:31:02,509 --> 00:31:06,529
sign for us and they don't really know

835
00:31:04,130 --> 00:31:09,240
exactly they think I belong the lakes is

836
00:31:06,529 --> 00:31:11,250
is actually a good place for the insects

837
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:12,599
five Adirondacks not so much but even

838
00:31:11,250 --> 00:31:13,319
there's some type of the southern tears

839
00:31:12,599 --> 00:31:14,849
not so good

840
00:31:13,319 --> 00:31:17,158
fortunately we grow a lot of grapes and

841
00:31:14,849 --> 00:31:18,569
apples up around the lake so in terms of

842
00:31:17,159 --> 00:31:20,370
production that's a problem

843
00:31:18,569 --> 00:31:24,048
so I think that's everything that the

844
00:31:20,369 --> 00:31:28,199
Haag have so again I love their

845
00:31:24,048 --> 00:31:29,639
advertising necessary I don't think you

846
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:32,909
can squash them all that easily maybe

847
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:35,720
that's a but I'm happy to answer

848
00:31:32,909 --> 00:31:35,720
questions if I can

849
00:31:39,109 --> 00:31:43,829
I'll be nice to Genevan I'm gonna ask

850
00:31:41,339 --> 00:31:50,069
Geneva first Geneva do you have any

851
00:31:43,829 --> 00:31:57,028
questions all right does anyone have

852
00:31:50,069 --> 00:31:58,349
questions here yes now I have to think

853
00:31:57,028 --> 00:32:02,369
of another one for the next time I give

854
00:31:58,349 --> 00:32:04,019
a summary never will forget I was

855
00:32:02,369 --> 00:32:07,019
curious if you're hearing reports from

856
00:32:04,019 --> 00:32:08,940
Pennsylvania lots of agronomics damage

857
00:32:07,019 --> 00:32:12,750
like is there indeed lots of agronomic

858
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:14,009
damage so they are doing lots of

859
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:15,419
pesticide spraying not just for the

860
00:32:14,009 --> 00:32:17,669
agronomic damage but also for the

861
00:32:15,419 --> 00:32:19,559
landscape issues and and so where

862
00:32:17,669 --> 00:32:22,500
they've seen the most damage that I've

863
00:32:19,558 --> 00:32:25,168
heard sorry question again have they

864
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:26,669
seen economic damage in Pennsylvania

865
00:32:25,169 --> 00:32:28,950
where they've seen the most is in grapes

866
00:32:26,669 --> 00:32:31,320
and hops they keep talking about hops

867
00:32:28,950 --> 00:32:33,120
but I haven't seen pictures like the one

868
00:32:31,319 --> 00:32:35,129
with the grape with a vineyard where you

869
00:32:33,119 --> 00:32:37,259
can actually see the plants are dead

870
00:32:35,130 --> 00:32:39,630
and the apples you know I guess you know

871
00:32:37,259 --> 00:32:41,548
those apples the fruits not affected but

872
00:32:39,630 --> 00:32:43,230
if you were someone harvesting my hand

873
00:32:41,548 --> 00:32:45,629
out in there with that many insects and

874
00:32:43,230 --> 00:32:47,038
that much go around I'm even if you know

875
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:48,659
even if the apples are fine you may have

876
00:32:47,038 --> 00:32:50,339
to now do washing or other things in

877
00:32:48,659 --> 00:32:53,278
terms of getting the honeydew in the

878
00:32:50,339 --> 00:32:55,230
city mold off them so I don't think they

879
00:32:53,278 --> 00:32:57,569
have I haven't I have not seen great

880
00:32:55,230 --> 00:33:00,120
information on other plant damage and I

881
00:32:57,569 --> 00:33:01,349
think a lot of it is again to me if you

882
00:33:00,119 --> 00:33:02,908
look at those little thing we said you

883
00:33:01,349 --> 00:33:04,379
could find them on basil they've got

884
00:33:02,909 --> 00:33:06,059
such a big mouth parts they go right

885
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:07,380
through the stems of basil you think and

886
00:33:06,058 --> 00:33:09,298
they probably suck it dry pretty quickly

887
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:12,210
so I was kind of surprised to see some

888
00:33:09,298 --> 00:33:16,139
of those more herbaceous things on the

889
00:33:12,210 --> 00:33:18,870
list yep so in addition to the two

890
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:22,278
pathogens that you showed us are there

891
00:33:18,869 --> 00:33:25,128
other natural predators in the native

892
00:33:22,278 --> 00:33:26,749
range of the insect so the question is

893
00:33:25,128 --> 00:33:28,548
are there other predators or other

894
00:33:26,749 --> 00:33:30,379
biological control organisms in the

895
00:33:28,548 --> 00:33:32,179
native range yes so those two little

896
00:33:30,378 --> 00:33:33,468
wasps that they were bringing in that

897
00:33:32,179 --> 00:33:34,190
are under quarantine that they're

898
00:33:33,469 --> 00:33:35,719
studying now

899
00:33:34,190 --> 00:33:37,580
those are both from China and we don't

900
00:33:35,719 --> 00:33:39,469
have them but of course it's not a fast

901
00:33:37,579 --> 00:33:40,939
process then because you have to bring

902
00:33:39,469 --> 00:33:41,989
them in and test them on all sorts of

903
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:43,729
things to make sure that they're not

904
00:33:41,989 --> 00:33:46,369
going to feed on anything that we

905
00:33:43,729 --> 00:33:48,710
actually want or damage anything else

906
00:33:46,368 --> 00:33:50,028
that's native here so the fact that they

907
00:33:48,710 --> 00:33:52,429
found the one that feeds that the egg

908
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:54,829
parasitoid of gypsy moth is surprising

909
00:33:52,429 --> 00:33:57,589
they're not related but so maybe it's a

910
00:33:54,829 --> 00:33:59,298
wasp it's like there's an egg we can we

911
00:33:57,588 --> 00:34:01,219
can figure out how to to Paris at eyes

912
00:33:59,298 --> 00:34:02,960
it but so and then whether or not there

913
00:34:01,219 --> 00:34:05,479
are other death aphanitic

914
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:06,798
or fungi or other things like that that

915
00:34:05,479 --> 00:34:08,329
they might bring in I haven't heard of

916
00:34:06,798 --> 00:34:10,219
anything but those two that they're

917
00:34:08,329 --> 00:34:12,379
working someone had a question back

918
00:34:10,219 --> 00:34:17,778
there yeah the negative range how cold

919
00:34:12,378 --> 00:34:18,798
is it like to go to New York so I don't

920
00:34:17,778 --> 00:34:20,239
know if the question was in the native

921
00:34:18,798 --> 00:34:22,519
range how cold is it compared to New

922
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:24,500
York I don't know the absolute answer on

923
00:34:22,519 --> 00:34:25,969
that certainly I've seen maps where they

924
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:29,659
see where they think it's going to it

925
00:34:25,969 --> 00:34:31,308
could survive and it you know once

926
00:34:29,659 --> 00:34:33,559
you're getting up much farther than New

927
00:34:31,309 --> 00:34:37,639
York State it's - it looks like they've

928
00:34:33,559 --> 00:34:39,528
got it as too cold but it may well be

929
00:34:37,639 --> 00:34:40,548
that it's not the temperature that it's

930
00:34:39,528 --> 00:34:41,659
not a temperature that's killing the

931
00:34:40,548 --> 00:34:43,639
eggs and I don't know the absolute

932
00:34:41,659 --> 00:34:46,148
temperature for killing the eggs my

933
00:34:43,639 --> 00:34:48,950
think my thought is that it's quite low

934
00:34:46,148 --> 00:34:51,828
which is unfortunate I'd like to kill

935
00:34:48,949 --> 00:34:55,699
the eggs any other questions

936
00:34:51,829 --> 00:34:58,720
yep I mean Korea's not that far from

937
00:34:55,699 --> 00:35:01,038
China why has it only been very recently

938
00:34:58,719 --> 00:35:02,449
that then that's also a good question

939
00:35:01,039 --> 00:35:04,549
and I don't know that it's through all

940
00:35:02,449 --> 00:35:06,318
of China I should go and look there is a

941
00:35:04,548 --> 00:35:08,150
map that they have that's at least the

942
00:35:06,318 --> 00:35:11,150
proposed distribution throughout the

943
00:35:08,150 --> 00:35:13,369
world and yes so especially if it's

944
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:15,619
moving on things like stone so if

945
00:35:13,369 --> 00:35:17,750
there's trade between the two places you

946
00:35:15,619 --> 00:35:21,410
would think that that would be an easy

947
00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:23,778
way for it to get there and why I didn't

948
00:35:21,409 --> 00:35:27,858
get there until 2014 I heard about then

949
00:35:23,778 --> 00:35:30,289
- I don't know I'm gonna have to go look

950
00:35:27,858 --> 00:35:33,318
that up seems like the native range is

951
00:35:30,289 --> 00:35:36,789
more like Vietnam from whatever have you

952
00:35:33,318 --> 00:35:36,788
yeah so maybe it's farther so

953
00:35:37,889 --> 00:35:42,159
any other questions do you know anything

954
00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:44,920
about crisper and spotted lantern fly

955
00:35:42,159 --> 00:35:47,319
other than stuff that no not

956
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:52,260
specifically with this but it's being

957
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:55,030
counted as the Oh save us a haul but

958
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:59,140
this is more of a comment rather than a

959
00:35:55,030 --> 00:36:00,970
question along highways there are rest

960
00:35:59,139 --> 00:36:03,849
stops and things like that and we're

961
00:36:00,969 --> 00:36:06,129
going to have observation posts you know

962
00:36:03,849 --> 00:36:08,259
whatever they might be I I look at rest

963
00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:09,579
stops I think that's where they're put I

964
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:11,850
think that I put anyone there in it for

965
00:36:09,579 --> 00:36:15,610
the trucks at the wing stations yeah

966
00:36:11,849 --> 00:36:19,150
there are very frequently

967
00:36:15,610 --> 00:36:21,519
I noticed Tree of Heaven growing around

968
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:24,610
freeway exchanges you know the ridges

969
00:36:21,519 --> 00:36:27,190
and things so that would both be maybe a

970
00:36:24,610 --> 00:36:31,240
place to concentrate eradication efforts

971
00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:33,300
although perhaps not in Brooklyn because

972
00:36:31,239 --> 00:36:38,289
this is the tree grows in Brooklyn right

973
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:41,820
also maybe have concentrated scouting

974
00:36:38,289 --> 00:36:45,579
efforts where you have these sequential

975
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:47,050
satellite yes and they may well be doing

976
00:36:45,579 --> 00:36:48,219
that in Pennsylvania but I and I think

977
00:36:47,050 --> 00:36:50,680
they're also doing it in New York

978
00:36:48,219 --> 00:36:52,569
and yes the concept of because Tree of

979
00:36:50,679 --> 00:36:54,399
Heaven is kind of a trash tree in a way

980
00:36:52,570 --> 00:36:56,559
and it ends up and it spreads and you

981
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:57,670
see a lot of it along roadways and so

982
00:36:56,559 --> 00:36:59,769
forth we did a program down in

983
00:36:57,670 --> 00:37:01,510
Westchester about the time when seeds

984
00:36:59,769 --> 00:37:02,980
were out and it looked like everywhere

985
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:05,680
we drove all the way along the roads

986
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:07,000
it's all Tree of Heaven it because it's

987
00:37:05,679 --> 00:37:08,949
a little bit hard to kill that makes

988
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,329
that also means that people aren't

989
00:37:08,949 --> 00:37:11,589
controlling it and it's areas where

990
00:37:10,329 --> 00:37:13,090
people aren't doing much management

991
00:37:11,590 --> 00:37:14,920
you're absolutely right so if you can

992
00:37:13,090 --> 00:37:16,450
use Tree of Heaven in the areas where

993
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:18,789
you think you might see it as it's

994
00:37:16,449 --> 00:37:21,460
moving outside of the zone it's in now

995
00:37:18,789 --> 00:37:23,679
certainly scouting and using those trees

996
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:26,019
as trap trees and places to treat with

997
00:37:23,679 --> 00:37:28,299
request society is a great way to do it

998
00:37:26,019 --> 00:37:29,860
they're also doing a lot of trapping in

999
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:30,940
fact they they have sticky traps that

1000
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:33,070
they're using and they found that they

1001
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:34,869
actually had to put cages over them

1002
00:37:33,070 --> 00:37:36,789
because they were getting other things

1003
00:37:34,869 --> 00:37:38,529
like birds even stuck to the sticky trap

1004
00:37:36,789 --> 00:37:40,539
so now they're trying to make the wire

1005
00:37:38,530 --> 00:37:41,800
mesh so that the spotted lentor fly

1006
00:37:40,539 --> 00:37:44,559
which actually goes up and down the

1007
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:45,880
trunk to some extent when they're young

1008
00:37:44,559 --> 00:37:47,079
that would they'll get stuck in other

1009
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:48,880
things won't but so you could do the

1010
00:37:47,079 --> 00:37:50,199
trapping and other things and that

1011
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:51,099
you're absolutely right makes sense to

1012
00:37:50,199 --> 00:37:53,228
do them places

1013
00:37:51,099 --> 00:37:54,880
vehicles are going to stop in places

1014
00:37:53,228 --> 00:37:57,969
that are going to have Tree of Heaven to

1015
00:37:54,880 --> 00:38:11,130
make it easy on yourself what's the plan

1016
00:37:57,969 --> 00:38:11,129
for longer than it takes now yeah yes

1017
00:38:14,159 --> 00:38:22,719
yes there's a lot of for them to feed on

1018
00:38:19,559 --> 00:38:24,900
so yeah I heard about you Matt this

1019
00:38:22,719 --> 00:38:27,998
issue and I just wondering because

1020
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:30,039
everywhere right so it'd be nice if we

1021
00:38:27,998 --> 00:38:32,379
had very rarely and they had to be there

1022
00:38:30,039 --> 00:38:34,778
would make it easier to use that as a

1023
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:36,759
management a management tool but because

1024
00:38:34,778 --> 00:38:39,009
they're everywhere and they're in places

1025
00:38:36,759 --> 00:38:41,048
that people aren't really looking it

1026
00:38:39,009 --> 00:38:43,509
makes it a little bit harder to use as

1027
00:38:41,048 --> 00:38:46,059
and as a perfect management tool early

1028
00:38:43,509 --> 00:38:47,528
on and I don't remember exactly there

1029
00:38:46,059 --> 00:38:50,499
where it was I saw a video that was a

1030
00:38:47,528 --> 00:38:52,900
building and there there were piles of

1031
00:38:50,498 --> 00:38:54,669
dead ones along sidewalks

1032
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:56,769
somebody else is nodding and I don't

1033
00:38:54,670 --> 00:38:58,778
know if they even know why they died but

1034
00:38:56,768 --> 00:39:01,238
just the numbers were amazing and and it

1035
00:38:58,778 --> 00:39:02,739
was clearly in an urban area they've got

1036
00:39:01,239 --> 00:39:04,420
you could go online you can find bars

1037
00:39:02,739 --> 00:39:05,440
that have competitions for how many you

1038
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:08,200
could SWAT with us

1039
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:10,900
slice water I've seen actually they made

1040
00:39:08,199 --> 00:39:13,149
beer coasters and wine coasters that are

1041
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:14,410
to promote knowing what spotted lantern

1042
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:16,028
fly is and getting rid of it and

1043
00:39:14,409 --> 00:39:19,478
contacting the Pennsylvania Department

1044
00:39:16,028 --> 00:39:21,728
of Agriculture as I say I've found like

1045
00:39:19,478 --> 00:39:23,679
maybe it's a non welcome mat a welcome

1046
00:39:21,728 --> 00:39:26,379
mat with a spotted Lantern fly on it and

1047
00:39:23,679 --> 00:39:29,228
get socks with us people are making

1048
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:31,269
jewelry out of real ones so people are

1049
00:39:29,228 --> 00:39:34,778
taking it as taking that on the

1050
00:39:31,268 --> 00:39:36,548
challenge and and but I think people if

1051
00:39:34,778 --> 00:39:38,349
you look at the house where the steps

1052
00:39:36,548 --> 00:39:39,699
that were coated and everything else we

1053
00:39:38,349 --> 00:39:40,930
don't need anything else that's going to

1054
00:39:39,699 --> 00:39:43,478
convince people that they don't want to

1055
00:39:40,929 --> 00:39:45,068
go outside and and to me like if you're

1056
00:39:43,478 --> 00:39:46,210
standing under a maple tree there was

1057
00:39:45,068 --> 00:39:47,108
someone doing a report and they're

1058
00:39:46,210 --> 00:39:48,880
standing under our maple tree and

1059
00:39:47,108 --> 00:39:50,889
they've got an umbrella and I realized

1060
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:52,660
oh that's the honeydew dripping that

1061
00:39:50,889 --> 00:39:55,058
they're trying to avoid so that's

1062
00:39:52,659 --> 00:39:57,338
another that whole issue of homeowners

1063
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:58,869
and tourists and everything else is I

1064
00:39:57,338 --> 00:40:01,210
think they're thinking and I don't think

1065
00:39:58,869 --> 00:40:02,469
we've counted what's the cost so we

1066
00:40:01,210 --> 00:40:04,710
don't want them so please don't bring

1067
00:40:02,469 --> 00:40:06,510
them so I tell all my girls

1068
00:40:04,710 --> 00:40:08,849
you do not be want to be the place where

1069
00:40:06,510 --> 00:40:11,310
they say oh this is where the population

1070
00:40:08,849 --> 00:40:15,588
started so even if your plant is not a

1071
00:40:11,309 --> 00:40:19,409
host be careful so any other questions

1072
00:40:15,588 --> 00:40:26,969
if you said grapes and Atlantis or the -

1073
00:40:19,409 --> 00:40:30,809
yeah so wild grapes right and also most

1074
00:40:26,969 --> 00:40:34,108
the plants that there seem to be using

1075
00:40:30,809 --> 00:40:39,269
our Sun webbing class so oh that's an

1076
00:40:34,108 --> 00:40:40,920
interesting point I don't know yeah

1077
00:40:39,269 --> 00:40:42,420
that's a good point so Nina's saying is

1078
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:44,250
that they plants on the list tend to be

1079
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:46,619
Sun loving plants and whether or not you

1080
00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:48,300
wouldn't find them in shady areas as

1081
00:40:46,619 --> 00:40:49,940
much I don't know the answer to that and

1082
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:52,080
I haven't seen anybody talk about that

1083
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:54,329
but as I say that I think we're still

1084
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:55,920
even though I mean that's six years and

1085
00:40:54,329 --> 00:40:58,049
it's been in Pennsylvania and certainly

1086
00:40:55,920 --> 00:41:00,000
you're still figuring things out so and

1087
00:40:58,050 --> 00:41:01,410
then there's even in terms of the map

1088
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,300
you know people don't want to have their

1089
00:41:01,409 --> 00:41:04,710
state put on the map so they don't want

1090
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:06,900
have their County put on the map so

1091
00:41:04,710 --> 00:41:14,000
they're trying to even get that yes is

1092
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:22,139
there any role for n-doped pesticides

1093
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:23,219
biologically based pesticides yes so so

1094
00:41:22,139 --> 00:41:25,319
the question is if there's any role for

1095
00:41:23,219 --> 00:41:26,639
systemic pesticides and yes what they

1096
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:29,099
tend to use when they're using those

1097
00:41:26,639 --> 00:41:31,469
three of heaven as trap trees is they're

1098
00:41:29,099 --> 00:41:33,359
actually using a systemic insecticide in

1099
00:41:31,469 --> 00:41:35,009
those so when the insects feed on it

1100
00:41:33,358 --> 00:41:37,949
they'll die and that's what they're

1101
00:41:35,010 --> 00:41:39,570
looking at primarily because again

1102
00:41:37,949 --> 00:41:41,608
trying to spray something and get good

1103
00:41:39,570 --> 00:41:43,830
contact over that number of insects when

1104
00:41:41,608 --> 00:41:45,269
they move around so much a systemic is a

1105
00:41:43,829 --> 00:41:47,429
much better idea and again you can get

1106
00:41:45,269 --> 00:41:50,009
away with you can use less pesticide and

1107
00:41:47,429 --> 00:41:52,319
get more effect and have it be really

1108
00:41:50,010 --> 00:41:54,270
spa treatment and in a controlled in a

1109
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:57,650
controlled sort of application which

1110
00:41:54,269 --> 00:42:01,579
from IPM point of view we like

1111
00:41:57,650 --> 00:42:04,298
yes trap that was more attractive to the

1112
00:42:01,579 --> 00:42:09,170
insect and we average one movie latest

1113
00:42:04,298 --> 00:42:10,460
yes and make it look like a big spotted

1114
00:42:09,170 --> 00:42:11,599
land why so exciting could you get

1115
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:13,039
something that's more attractive than

1116
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:18,619
the average car just sitting out there

1117
00:42:13,039 --> 00:42:20,420
screaming trap right trap it's not well

1118
00:42:18,619 --> 00:42:21,710
they're looking for pheromones and that

1119
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:23,450
so if you can find something that would

1120
00:42:21,710 --> 00:42:25,400
be even if it's not enough to trap them

1121
00:42:23,449 --> 00:42:27,259
to control him but it's enough to tell

1122
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:29,838
you that they're around and that's why

1123
00:42:27,259 --> 00:42:31,998
some having something like a spud

1124
00:42:29,838 --> 00:42:33,828
lantern fly sniffing dog they did have

1125
00:42:31,998 --> 00:42:35,389
one situation where the dog kept

1126
00:42:33,829 --> 00:42:36,950
pointing it you know saying it's here

1127
00:42:35,389 --> 00:42:39,018
and they couldn't find it and they did

1128
00:42:36,949 --> 00:42:41,358
finally find it inside the grill of the

1129
00:42:39,018 --> 00:42:43,788
vehicle and so they're well trained but

1130
00:42:41,358 --> 00:42:46,098
so yeah something like that where it's a

1131
00:42:43,789 --> 00:42:48,319
faster made a faster means of doing it

1132
00:42:46,099 --> 00:42:50,059
because thinking about trying to clean

1133
00:42:48,318 --> 00:42:52,788
off every vehicle that's going down the

1134
00:42:50,059 --> 00:42:55,130
highway route 15 into into New Yorker

1135
00:42:52,789 --> 00:42:57,890
