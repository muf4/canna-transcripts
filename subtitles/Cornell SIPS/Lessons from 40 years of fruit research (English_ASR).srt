1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:05,040
this is a production of cornell

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:05,040
university

3
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:17,359
okay thanks very much neil i'm not going

4
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:18,480
to talk about everything i did in the

5
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:21,920
last 40 years

6
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:25,439
because it would take about 40 years

7
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:28,560
thanks bill i would

8
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:30,240
uh when talked to neil about the

9
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:32,238
possibly doing this we thought it might

10
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:34,159
be interesting to take a little more

11
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:36,238
philosophical type of approach rather

12
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:38,799
than just showing a lot of data

13
00:00:36,238 --> 00:00:40,238
and uh talk about you know over a career

14
00:00:38,799 --> 00:00:40,959
what some of the lessons are that you

15
00:00:40,238 --> 00:00:42,878
learn

16
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,558
that you wish you knew at the beginning

17
00:00:42,878 --> 00:00:48,238
of your career

18
00:00:44,558 --> 00:00:49,519
so i put this together some of the

19
00:00:48,238 --> 00:00:51,519
latter parts going to be sort of

20
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:53,520
miscellaneous observations but

21
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:56,559
they hopefully they might be of some

22
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,559
some use to somebody

23
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,759
so first of all when you get started on

24
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:01,439
doing research

25
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:03,198
uh one of the questions that we don't

26
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:06,239
sort of ask ourselves

27
00:01:03,198 --> 00:01:07,920
implicitly but we actually do is so how

28
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:10,839
am i going to actually do this

29
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,960
what type of approach should i use for

30
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:16,320
research and

31
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:18,798
i heard a talk from success from the

32
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:19,359
australian wine research institute and

33
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:23,040
he uh

34
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:24,079
he showed this example of different

35
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,479
types of research

36
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:28,719
and his little matrix with research

37
00:01:26,478 --> 00:01:31,039
inspired by fundamental understanding

38
00:01:28,719 --> 00:01:33,280
with a yes or no and then research

39
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:36,560
inspired utility

40
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:37,200
by utility or or application yes or no

41
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,560
so

42
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,560
when you look at these of course you got

43
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:44,799
four quadrants he called one of them

44
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:46,719
bores after niels bohr the uh

45
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:48,799
physicist where it's pursued a

46
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:50,560
fundamental understanding

47
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:52,159
uh alone without any immediate

48
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,478
application and

49
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:55,759
that's uh you know basically basic

50
00:01:54,478 --> 00:01:57,599
research which is

51
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:59,280
fine and is something that's very

52
00:01:57,599 --> 00:02:01,599
important uh

53
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,560
kitty corner from that is the edison's

54
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:05,280
quadrant

55
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,240
which is uh pursuit of practical utility

56
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,199
but

57
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:10,079
not necessarily uh with an understanding

58
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:12,318
in mind but a

59
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,200
trial and error approach which has also

60
00:02:12,318 --> 00:02:17,199
been very

61
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:20,479
useful but he felt and i i agree that uh

62
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:23,839
probably the most useful approach

63
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:26,000
is what he called pasteur's approach

64
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,840
and that is integrated approach for a

65
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,199
fundamental understanding

66
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:32,878
and practical utility together and so if

67
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:33,759
you can do both of those and integrate

68
00:02:32,878 --> 00:02:36,318
them then

69
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:38,159
i think that's a preferable way of

70
00:02:36,318 --> 00:02:39,518
course you want to avoid the joker's

71
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:43,840
quadrant

72
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:46,879
of no value in either direction so

73
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:48,719
from saki's paper

74
00:02:46,878 --> 00:02:50,639
he basically said that the pasteurian

75
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:52,239
research is what's needed

76
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:53,919
towards increasing fundamental

77
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:55,840
understanding and

78
00:02:53,919 --> 00:02:58,158
i think the important thing in a context

79
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:00,239
responsive to applied needs

80
00:02:58,158 --> 00:03:02,000
at levels of both problem selection and

81
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:05,439
experimental design

82
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:08,400
now for us this i think this fits uh

83
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:08,878
the horticultural area i think we can

84
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,120
learn

85
00:03:08,878 --> 00:03:13,840
the fundamental understanding but if

86
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:17,360
it's in the context of a real problem

87
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:20,239
i think we gain in both directions so um

88
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,680
and then uh that usually if you have

89
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:22,800
that type of approach you're going to

90
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,719
try to understand

91
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,159
the physiological principle behind

92
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:27,840
things and so

93
00:03:26,158 --> 00:03:30,000
emerson had a nice quote that i think

94
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,120
summed it up nicely the value of a

95
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,799
principle

96
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,480
is in the number of things that will

97
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:37,599
explain

98
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:38,560
okay and uh another way of looking at it

99
00:03:37,598 --> 00:03:41,119
is

100
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,680
that if you have a system where for

101
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,599
example

102
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:47,760
environmental responses of

103
00:03:45,598 --> 00:03:49,839
of plants that if you have a

104
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:52,158
physiological principle of the plant

105
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,959
here in the middle it will interact with

106
00:03:52,158 --> 00:03:55,840
different

107
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:56,158
environmental conditions so the weather

108
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,479
a

109
00:03:56,158 --> 00:04:01,519
is might be a one year whether b might

110
00:03:58,479 --> 00:04:02,959
be a different year

111
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:04,480
the interaction between the

112
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:05,598
physiological principle and the

113
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:09,518
environment will give an

114
00:04:05,598 --> 00:04:11,759
outcome now in one year it might be dry

115
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:13,360
and you'll get a certain outcome and

116
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:16,478
another year it might be wet

117
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:19,519
and you'll get a different outcome

118
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:21,918
so the outcomes will vary along with the

119
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:22,800
with the inputs but the physiological

120
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:24,879
principle

121
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,840
doesn't change and so if you can

122
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:27,680
understand that

123
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:29,279
you're going to be much better at being

124
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,918
able to predict what's going to happen

125
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:36,159
or explain what happened

126
00:04:31,918 --> 00:04:37,599
and in many cases if we do field trials

127
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,919
you know in different years we get

128
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,199
different results and that doesn't

129
00:04:39,918 --> 00:04:43,439
always make a lot of sense

130
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:44,560
unless you understand the the principle

131
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:47,040
that is

132
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,959
interacting and uh you're giving a

133
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:52,479
different manifestation of the

134
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:54,959
that final outcome so um

135
00:04:52,478 --> 00:04:56,478
again i've i really tried to focus on

136
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:57,359
understanding what the physiological

137
00:04:56,478 --> 00:05:00,560
principles are

138
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:03,439
be behind the growth and development and

139
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,879
performance of primarily grapes and

140
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:06,800
apples that i've worked with over the

141
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:10,079
years

142
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:12,879
okay so my research goals really

143
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:14,478
is to uh been to understand the

144
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:15,759
environmental and physiological

145
00:05:14,478 --> 00:05:19,038
limitations

146
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:20,240
to both the basic biological uh as well

147
00:05:19,038 --> 00:05:23,360
as the economic

148
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:24,319
productivity of grapes and tree fruits

149
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,840
especially

150
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:30,000
apples but also to utilize that in

151
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:31,519
information collaboratively with

152
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:36,000
colleagues like

153
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:38,399
terence robinson and others to

154
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,720
to use that information to improve the

155
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:45,038
productivity or the performance

156
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:47,600
or the efficiency sustainability of

157
00:05:45,038 --> 00:05:48,879
of our tree performance and the cultural

158
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:53,439
practices that we

159
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:56,800
that we use again i i'm emphasizing

160
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:58,240
primarily light or energy uh carbon and

161
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:01,280
water relations

162
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,918
uh but i i try to in uh integrate those

163
00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:04,399
with

164
00:06:01,918 --> 00:06:06,000
information like from la lang chang on

165
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:08,879
nutrition and and

166
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,079
other other disciplines but that's

167
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:13,120
that's the area that i'm

168
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:15,279
focusing in um

169
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:17,120
okay instead of going through all the

170
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:20,000
details i thought i'd give

171
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:22,079
maybe three examples of some work that

172
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
started out asking fundamental questions

173
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:27,120
and ended up giving some practical

174
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:30,079
outcomes and one of them is

175
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,639
about i was wondering about apple trees

176
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:33,038
how much

177
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:35,038
dry matter they produce over the season

178
00:06:33,038 --> 00:06:37,038
what's really controlling that

179
00:06:35,038 --> 00:06:38,879
things like different climates why can

180
00:06:37,038 --> 00:06:40,800
new zealand produce twice the fruit that

181
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:42,719
we can

182
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:45,759
you know what what's really controlling

183
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:49,440
uh the productivity from a carbon

184
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:51,840
uh standpoint and then because of that

185
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:53,759
study over the years we gradually

186
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:55,598
developed a simulation model that i'll

187
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:58,240
talk about that has actually become

188
00:06:55,598 --> 00:07:01,680
useful for growers

189
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:06,160
so that's one example another one

190
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:07,918
is in terms of water use by apples

191
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,759
and you know the need for potential

192
00:07:07,918 --> 00:07:11,598
irrigation

193
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:12,800
i wanted to really understand you know

194
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:15,680
how how much

195
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:18,319
does the apple tree use because it has

196
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:20,800
some unusual characteristics

197
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:22,720
and what is what controls it under our

198
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,478
type of conditions

199
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:26,080
and that eventually led to an apple

200
00:07:24,478 --> 00:07:29,439
specific

201
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:31,758
penman-monteith equation for water use

202
00:07:29,439 --> 00:07:33,120
that is now being used by growers as

203
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:36,160
well

204
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:39,199
and then finally uh a nagging question

205
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:42,160
with water relations over the years is

206
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:43,759
how can we try to measure uh and

207
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:46,720
continuously monitor

208
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:47,360
the water relations of plants perennial

209
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,599
plants are

210
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:51,038
are particularly dynamic in their water

211
00:07:49,598 --> 00:07:53,759
relations

212
00:07:51,038 --> 00:07:55,038
and so it's so dynamic that just taking

213
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:57,840
a reading once a week

214
00:07:55,038 --> 00:07:58,399
isn't going to give you a very good uh

215
00:07:57,839 --> 00:08:01,679
overall

216
00:07:58,399 --> 00:08:03,918
view so you know looked into that and

217
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:06,879
how we can possibly do that and

218
00:08:03,918 --> 00:08:07,918
um so the sensor that uh vinay has been

219
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:10,720
working on

220
00:08:07,918 --> 00:08:11,439
uh is an example of of the outcome of

221
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:16,720
that

222
00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:16,719
so let me try to run through these

223
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:21,918
in the carbon balance area

224
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:24,240
some of the more specific questions

225
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:26,639
beyond just how much

226
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:28,560
dry matter does an apple tree produce in

227
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:30,720
the season

228
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:33,599
we're interested in what are the dynamic

229
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:36,399
patterns over the season

230
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:37,759
and during those different patterns

231
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:39,440
because not everything is

232
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:41,200
the demand and supply doesn't always

233
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,800
stay exactly in balance

234
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,560
are there key periods where there might

235
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:46,000
be a carbon deficit

236
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:49,199
and is there anything we could do about

237
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:52,240
that and so

238
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:53,680
we took a lot of field measurements

239
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:56,240
down in the lower left corner you can

240
00:08:53,679 --> 00:08:58,319
see we've used the whole canopy balloon

241
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:01,839
chambers

242
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,839
we have in some cases

243
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:06,799
had as many as 45 days during a season

244
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:09,600
that we measured

245
00:09:06,799 --> 00:09:11,199
measured them but we've done a lot of

246
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,080
single leaf and fruit development

247
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,240
measurements

248
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,278
but a lot of a lot of spot measurements

249
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:17,039
over the season

250
00:09:15,278 --> 00:09:18,320
but we'd like to try to integrate those

251
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:20,559
uh better

252
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:22,560
and so we ended up developing a

253
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:25,838
simulation model which i'll

254
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:30,079
show next about the

255
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:33,360
carbon balance of apples with malasim or

256
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:34,800
vitasim as the grape version

257
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:37,759
and we found over the years that it was

258
00:09:34,799 --> 00:09:40,639
very important to to

259
00:09:37,759 --> 00:09:42,799
go iteratively between the measurements

260
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:44,559
and the modeling

261
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:46,240
because the the modeling helps you

262
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:48,319
integrate the measurements

263
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:49,360
but then you can also get some wild

264
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,440
values if you're

265
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:53,440
if you're not always checking against

266
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:55,839
real measurements with the modeling

267
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,640
so i found that modeling and measurement

268
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:59,920
uh

269
00:09:56,639 --> 00:10:02,399
really fit together well and i think

270
00:09:59,919 --> 00:10:02,958
i was far better off doing both of them

271
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:07,360
rather than

272
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:07,359
one or the other okay

273
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:11,679
so i won't go through all of it but this

274
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:14,079
is basically a carbon balance

275
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:15,838
model we're trying to look for the

276
00:10:14,078 --> 00:10:17,439
carbon supply

277
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:18,959
and of course that depends on the

278
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:20,480
sunlight available and

279
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:22,399
what's intercepted and leaf

280
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:24,079
photosynthesis to convert it

281
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:25,839
into dry matter and of course many of

282
00:10:24,078 --> 00:10:28,559
the things around the outside

283
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:29,279
are factors that kind of influence those

284
00:10:28,559 --> 00:10:30,958
um

285
00:10:29,278 --> 00:10:32,559
and then we looked at the total demand

286
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:36,559
of respiration and growth

287
00:10:32,559 --> 00:10:40,078
of the different parts of the plant

288
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:41,119
and then this gives a general carbon

289
00:10:40,078 --> 00:10:43,439
supply demand

290
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:45,600
balance which we found very useful but

291
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:48,800
we also have components for fruit drop

292
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:51,040
and partitioning which don't really have

293
00:10:48,799 --> 00:10:54,559
time to go into but

294
00:10:51,039 --> 00:10:56,559
it's as simplified a model as possible

295
00:10:54,559 --> 00:10:58,559
although it still ends up being

296
00:10:56,559 --> 00:11:02,319
relatively complex to

297
00:10:58,559 --> 00:11:04,639
to put it together so when we did

298
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:05,920
to take a look at what was going on we

299
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:09,759
could estimate that the

300
00:11:05,919 --> 00:11:12,719
supply uh in in the blue here

301
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:13,519
uh you know initially dips because of

302
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,079
reserves

303
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:17,600
being used up so this is current supply

304
00:11:16,078 --> 00:11:19,120
current photosynthesis

305
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,120
and then peaks in the middle of the

306
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,600
season and then gradually drops off with

307
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:25,440
the

308
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:28,320
shorter days and less radiation

309
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:29,600
but the demands these more solid lines

310
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:33,120
are the

311
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:36,959
general demand curves for a normal crop

312
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:39,600
of fruit and then a heavier crop being

313
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:41,039
so there is some carbon deficit during a

314
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:44,000
good part of the season

315
00:11:41,039 --> 00:11:46,078
but with apples since you have a 10 to

316
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,720
20 times more

317
00:11:46,078 --> 00:11:51,120
flowers producing initial fruit than you

318
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:54,480
actually want to take to harvest

319
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:55,120
if all those fruit stayed on the demand

320
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,200
curve

321
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:58,879
is this purple one this initial crop

322
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:01,839
that just skyrockets and goes

323
00:11:58,879 --> 00:12:04,480
crazy because a tree might have two

324
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:07,040
thousand fruit and you want two hundred

325
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,600
so those two thousand fruit really take

326
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:10,000
off

327
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,879
and you can see that in the couple weeks

328
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,799
after bloom

329
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:14,559
a week to three weeks after bloom is

330
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:17,039
where you get a really dramatic

331
00:12:14,559 --> 00:12:19,199
carbon deficit of course that's right at

332
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:21,679
a time during a

333
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:23,759
natural fruit drop and then also during

334
00:12:21,679 --> 00:12:26,719
the response to chemical thinning

335
00:12:23,759 --> 00:12:28,799
so that sort of gave us a hint something

336
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:30,160
there was a physiological basis for some

337
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:33,278
of those

338
00:12:30,159 --> 00:12:36,159
things so using these types of

339
00:12:33,278 --> 00:12:38,000
simulations not trying to be too precise

340
00:12:36,159 --> 00:12:40,639
but looking at general patterns

341
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,159
and see when maybe the supply and demand

342
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:43,360
might be in balance or might be out of

343
00:12:42,159 --> 00:12:45,600
balance

344
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:47,278
was very helpful to focus our research

345
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:49,759
right into that

346
00:12:47,278 --> 00:12:51,039
time period where there's normally a

347
00:12:49,759 --> 00:12:53,200
tendency to you know

348
00:12:51,039 --> 00:12:54,399
have equally spaced readings over a

349
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:58,399
season

350
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:59,120
um in the last probably last 10 or 15

351
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:01,759
years i'm

352
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:04,159
i've almost never taken any readings

353
00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:07,200
after a month after bloom

354
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:09,039
because i know what's going to happen

355
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,879
the all the action really is occurring

356
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:13,199
early and so we do

357
00:13:10,879 --> 00:13:14,320
follow up with some readings later but

358
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,399
uh

359
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:19,120
but the action is occurring at that time

360
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:20,078
so the model helped us really identify

361
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:23,278
this

362
00:13:20,078 --> 00:13:25,919
and so help focus our research to be

363
00:13:23,278 --> 00:13:29,039
more efficient

364
00:13:25,919 --> 00:13:31,439
it also turned out at that time if you

365
00:13:29,039 --> 00:13:33,599
measure the measure a lot of fruit we

366
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:36,480
measured the fruit growth of

367
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:38,320
probably 10 or 12 000 fruits over the

368
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:41,440
years

369
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:44,480
during the that post bloom period

370
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:45,040
what we find is that the general pattern

371
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:48,560
is that

372
00:13:45,039 --> 00:13:51,360
if the fruits are growing at a high rate

373
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:52,159
uh usually something like 60 or 70

374
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,079
percent of

375
00:13:52,159 --> 00:13:57,120
the maximum rate that you would have at

376
00:13:54,078 --> 00:14:00,479
that time under those conditions

377
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,879
they will stay on the tree if the fruit

378
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,879
stop

379
00:14:00,879 --> 00:14:04,000
growing or slow their growth

380
00:14:02,879 --> 00:14:07,198
dramatically

381
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:10,480
they're going to fall off and

382
00:14:07,198 --> 00:14:11,838
it may be 10 14 days later before they

383
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:14,240
actually fall off

384
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:16,079
but we can tell by monitoring the fruit

385
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:18,320
usually within three or four days out

386
00:14:16,078 --> 00:14:19,359
if we're very careful within three or

387
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:21,920
four days after

388
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:22,639
say a chemical thinner or maybe a really

389
00:14:21,919 --> 00:14:25,198
shady

390
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:25,680
or low light period we can tell which

391
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:27,838
ones

392
00:14:25,679 --> 00:14:29,759
are going to fall off maybe 10 days

393
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:32,560
later

394
00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:34,078
because it to be retained they have to

395
00:14:32,559 --> 00:14:36,879
continue growth

396
00:14:34,078 --> 00:14:37,919
uh continue at a high growth rate now we

397
00:14:36,879 --> 00:14:39,600
we make it

398
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:41,519
as a fraction of the fastest growing

399
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,720
fruit because if it's colder

400
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:44,639
everything's going to grow somewhat

401
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:47,040
slower so

402
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:49,519
the absolute rate isn't isn't so

403
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:53,039
important

404
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:56,720
so we have incorporated this into the

405
00:14:53,039 --> 00:14:58,399
end of the model for a drop of fruit

406
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:01,278
but this is what's occurring at that

407
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:04,320
time when you have a carbon deficit

408
00:15:01,278 --> 00:15:06,000
so working with terrance we're saying

409
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,519
well you know we have some years that we

410
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,559
get

411
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:12,078
you know we get a big heavy drop natural

412
00:15:10,559 --> 00:15:14,799
drop and we get a strong response

413
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:15,120
to chemical thinners other years we put

414
00:15:14,799 --> 00:15:17,359
the

415
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,399
same thinner on same time same stage of

416
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:21,039
development and

417
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:22,480
you get very little drop you know so

418
00:15:21,039 --> 00:15:25,599
chemical thing has been very

419
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:27,600
very erratic the

420
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:29,040
the growers know that if you go out and

421
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:31,440
do exactly the same thing

422
00:15:29,039 --> 00:15:32,958
put on the same chemical same time same

423
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,800
stage same orchard you're going to get

424
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:36,479
different results every year

425
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:38,799
which is sort of like the definition of

426
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:41,120
insanity doing the same thing over and

427
00:15:38,799 --> 00:15:43,519
over but expecting different results

428
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:45,120
so so we thought well let's try to bring

429
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:46,959
some sanity to this

430
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:48,159
and see if the model might be able to

431
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:51,278
help us

432
00:15:48,159 --> 00:15:53,278
understand that so

433
00:15:51,278 --> 00:15:54,399
i started looking to see whether the

434
00:15:53,278 --> 00:15:57,838
model might help us

435
00:15:54,399 --> 00:16:00,559
understand natural drop for example

436
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:01,680
and this was an example from in uruguay

437
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:03,198
when i was there

438
00:16:01,679 --> 00:16:04,719
i happened to be there right about the

439
00:16:03,198 --> 00:16:07,359
time that there was

440
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:09,920
a lot of fruit drop and normally apples

441
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:12,000
will drop at a much smaller size

442
00:16:09,919 --> 00:16:14,000
than that but we were having fruit that

443
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,679
were some of them were up to 24

444
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,759
millimeters in size

445
00:16:15,679 --> 00:16:19,120
they had a heavy initial set and they

446
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:20,000
just kept growing and growing and

447
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:22,480
growing

448
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,519
and then there was a huge drop and it

449
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,680
just

450
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:26,639
the industry lost about 30 percent of

451
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:30,078
its normal

452
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:31,600
it was 70 of normal crop and it

453
00:16:30,078 --> 00:16:33,758
occurred just before all the hand

454
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:36,480
thinning that was supposed to be done by

455
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:38,159
50 000 workers there who all all of a

456
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:40,159
sudden were out of a job

457
00:16:38,159 --> 00:16:41,360
and when we looked at the we ran their

458
00:16:40,159 --> 00:16:44,000
weather data

459
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:45,519
through the carbon balance model and

460
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:50,799
what we found was at this

461
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:52,959
early initial critical time the uh

462
00:16:50,799 --> 00:16:54,399
in blue here you can see the circle that

463
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:57,119
we had abnormally good

464
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:58,879
carbon balance and when we have that we

465
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,320
see that the fruit don't fall off

466
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:01,198
because they're all able to continue

467
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,759
growing or

468
00:17:01,198 --> 00:17:04,720
much greater proportion can continue to

469
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:06,480
grow

470
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,759
so we ended up having a lot of quite

471
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:12,000
large fruit

472
00:17:07,759 --> 00:17:13,439
then they had five really cloudy days

473
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,439
they weren't particularly hot or

474
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:17,038
anything but they were just very cloudy

475
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:17,439
days that they didn't really think much

476
00:17:17,038 --> 00:17:18,959
about

477
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:21,120
you know it was a cloudy week you know

478
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:23,759
well it was very cloudy

479
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:24,639
and the carbon deficit just went really

480
00:17:23,759 --> 00:17:27,439
through the

481
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:29,520
through the floor and we find in this uh

482
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:31,360
this orange band here this is roughly

483
00:17:29,519 --> 00:17:34,240
sort of our threshold

484
00:17:31,359 --> 00:17:35,519
for having a strong effect so it can

485
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:37,519
bounce around above that

486
00:17:35,519 --> 00:17:39,839
but if it goes below that you're going

487
00:17:37,519 --> 00:17:42,558
to probably see a strong

488
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:43,599
reduction and this occurred right about

489
00:17:42,558 --> 00:17:47,599
the time these were

490
00:17:43,599 --> 00:17:51,199
just really having a huge uh demand

491
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:52,798
and uh so when you have five or six days

492
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,798
of really reduced growth

493
00:17:52,798 --> 00:17:56,558
then you're going to have a huge drop so

494
00:17:54,798 --> 00:17:57,200
it looks like it can help explain

495
00:17:56,558 --> 00:18:01,839
natural

496
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:01,840
drop okay so then yes

497
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:08,558
um i think that was somewhere in the 30

498
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:12,160
to 40 percent

499
00:18:08,558 --> 00:18:15,279
of normal radiation which

500
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:17,840
is not abnormal it was

501
00:18:15,279 --> 00:18:19,839
uh i mean we we'll see that overcast you

502
00:18:17,839 --> 00:18:21,439
know fairly heavy overcast

503
00:18:19,839 --> 00:18:23,519
uh the real key was that it was like

504
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:25,200
five days in a row

505
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:27,599
because one day doesn't really do much

506
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,319
to apples two days a little bit three

507
00:18:27,599 --> 00:18:30,959
days you

508
00:18:28,319 --> 00:18:32,399
really have a strong effect and more

509
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:35,519
even more so

510
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:38,720
um so it looked like natural drop could

511
00:18:35,519 --> 00:18:40,400
could relate to the carbon balance um

512
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:42,480
and then terence had been doing some

513
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:45,038
studies where he was putting on

514
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:46,160
uh chemical thinners exactly the same

515
00:18:45,038 --> 00:18:49,599
concentration

516
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:52,000
but about every four days on an orchard

517
00:18:49,599 --> 00:18:54,000
not not the same trees obviously uh so

518
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:57,279
he wanted to see what the timing was

519
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:59,200
and he would find that one year the best

520
00:18:57,279 --> 00:19:00,000
thinning occurred maybe the first week

521
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,519
after bloom

522
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,200
another one it would be three weeks

523
00:19:01,519 --> 00:19:04,160
after bloom another one two weeks after

524
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:06,160
bloom

525
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:07,919
uh and it was really erratic you

526
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:10,080
couldn't couldn't specifically

527
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:11,280
guess as to when it was going to be so

528
00:19:10,079 --> 00:19:13,279
he had this data

529
00:19:11,279 --> 00:19:15,279
on timing and so we started looking

530
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:18,399
we've got many different years but

531
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:21,519
there's an example where the

532
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:24,080
zero line means the carbon is in balance

533
00:19:21,519 --> 00:19:25,440
so anything above is excess and below

534
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:27,759
his deficit so

535
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:29,038
i found that everything was pretty much

536
00:19:27,759 --> 00:19:32,240
in balance

537
00:19:29,038 --> 00:19:35,599
um until we uh we got hit

538
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:40,079
about 17 to 20 days after

539
00:19:35,599 --> 00:19:42,719
so we had some i was warm and cloudy

540
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:44,240
and then we had another big dip and it

541
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:45,919
uh so we found that when we put the

542
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:48,240
thinner on at that time

543
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:50,400
we got the strongest thinning now that's

544
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:51,200
been observed many times by growers so

545
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,960
it's not

546
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,558
they know if it's warm and cloudy you're

547
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:55,120
going to have a strong thinner response

548
00:19:54,558 --> 00:19:56,960
but

549
00:19:55,119 --> 00:19:59,038
it did seem to correlate with the carbon

550
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:02,079
balance so

551
00:19:59,038 --> 00:20:05,440
we've tested this

552
00:20:02,079 --> 00:20:09,279
and so the way we're using this

553
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:12,320
uh i didn't really put the r there but

554
00:20:09,279 --> 00:20:14,879
thanks bill gates um

555
00:20:12,319 --> 00:20:15,439
any case the uh the way we're using this

556
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,559
model

557
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:20,000
is uh we're using it similar to the

558
00:20:18,558 --> 00:20:22,720
penman-monteith equation

559
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,679
for evapotranspiration where you have a

560
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,919
standard

561
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:27,840
reference plant like their standard

562
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:30,880
grass

563
00:20:27,839 --> 00:20:32,319
and which the parameters are set but

564
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:34,559
then you put in the weather for

565
00:20:32,319 --> 00:20:36,319
different years or different periods

566
00:20:34,558 --> 00:20:38,720
and then you can see what does the

567
00:20:36,319 --> 00:20:41,678
weather do to that standard plant

568
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:43,000
and so that's the basis of a lot of the

569
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:45,840
estimation of

570
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:48,480
evapotranspiration that is uh used and

571
00:20:45,839 --> 00:20:50,879
we'll i'll talk about a little bit later

572
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:52,159
so we're basically doing the same thing

573
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:55,039
uh with the

574
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:56,400
with the apple model and having a quote

575
00:20:55,038 --> 00:20:58,079
standard tree

576
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,840
and then we can put in weather from

577
00:20:58,079 --> 00:21:02,639
different climates and different

578
00:20:59,839 --> 00:21:04,399
years or different treatments if you put

579
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:06,400
a shade on for example

580
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:08,640
and then we can see what that would do

581
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:12,400
to say a carbon reference

582
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:13,840
and so terence started using this for

583
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:16,240
growers

584
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:17,678
where he was before he went out to speak

585
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:20,558
to the growers right at

586
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:21,600
the beginning of thinning he would run

587
00:21:20,558 --> 00:21:22,879
the model

588
00:21:21,599 --> 00:21:24,798
and then he would look for something

589
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:27,600
like a very strong deficit

590
00:21:24,798 --> 00:21:29,440
here in the circle on the bottom here uh

591
00:21:27,599 --> 00:21:30,639
where the

592
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:33,120
where it looked like it was going to be

593
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:36,880
a significant deficit during that

594
00:21:33,119 --> 00:21:38,319
sensitive period and he was able to warn

595
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:41,200
some of the growers

596
00:21:38,319 --> 00:21:42,158
uh that there was you know a severe

597
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,880
deficit coming

598
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:46,320
be careful about maybe using the same

599
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:48,080
normal concentration

600
00:21:46,319 --> 00:21:49,359
perhaps reduce the concentration of

601
00:21:48,079 --> 00:21:51,359
thinners

602
00:21:49,359 --> 00:21:52,959
and over the years that that turned out

603
00:21:51,359 --> 00:21:54,240
that it was very very helpful

604
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:56,000
and the growers had become much more

605
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:58,319
confident about

606
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,440
about their thinning using this type of

607
00:21:58,319 --> 00:22:02,480
model

608
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:02,880
and uh people from all over the world

609
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:06,079
are

610
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:07,200
testing this now and working with it but

611
00:22:06,079 --> 00:22:09,918
for the

612
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:12,240
new york growers uh we worked with the

613
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:15,520
climate center with

614
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:20,400
art digatano and keith eggleston

615
00:22:15,519 --> 00:22:23,918
and we we put a the carbon balance model

616
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:27,280
we translated it jim myers one of our

617
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:30,720
ex-students justine's postdoc

618
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:32,480
some of his time was we purchased to

619
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:35,360
translate the model into an excel

620
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:38,079
version and then also into python for

621
00:22:35,359 --> 00:22:39,519
an online version so what we can do now

622
00:22:38,079 --> 00:22:42,720
is the grower can go in

623
00:22:39,519 --> 00:22:45,440
select their weather station from the

624
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:47,440
automated weather stations and put in

625
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:49,840
information on the

626
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:50,960
when the trees begin to grow to start

627
00:22:49,839 --> 00:22:54,639
the model

628
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:55,200
and then the uh then the output shows

629
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,720
the

630
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:58,798
it only needs maximum minimum

631
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:59,759
temperatures and solar radiation for

632
00:22:58,798 --> 00:23:01,440
each day

633
00:22:59,759 --> 00:23:03,359
so it's the daily time step so you get

634
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,798
the data there and then it gives the

635
00:23:03,359 --> 00:23:08,399
production of demand

636
00:23:04,798 --> 00:23:10,558
and the carbon balance uh and there's a

637
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,840
four-day running average because the

638
00:23:10,558 --> 00:23:14,079
tree buffers out

639
00:23:11,839 --> 00:23:16,158
you know like one day i won't do it

640
00:23:14,079 --> 00:23:18,079
there's a buffering

641
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:19,520
and then terence has developed thinning

642
00:23:18,079 --> 00:23:22,798
recommendations based

643
00:23:19,519 --> 00:23:24,400
on what type of carbon deficit we're

644
00:23:22,798 --> 00:23:27,440
looking at

645
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:29,519
so this is being used currently we have

646
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:31,360
growers and consultants that actually

647
00:23:29,519 --> 00:23:33,599
have the model themselves and have been

648
00:23:31,359 --> 00:23:36,719
running them and

649
00:23:33,599 --> 00:23:38,158
one of the growers was reporting that he

650
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:41,519
was able to reduce his

651
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:43,760
post thinning hand thinning bill

652
00:23:41,519 --> 00:23:45,278
because he normally was he wasn't

653
00:23:43,759 --> 00:23:47,119
comfortable with the chemical

654
00:23:45,278 --> 00:23:49,038
so i was used a little less and he

655
00:23:47,119 --> 00:23:49,599
always had too many fruit so then he had

656
00:23:49,038 --> 00:23:52,240
to

657
00:23:49,599 --> 00:23:54,158
pay for extra hand thinning so he had

658
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:55,839
reduced this hand thinning from

659
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:58,240
about a hundred thousand dollars a year

660
00:23:55,839 --> 00:24:01,199
down to about 20 000 a year

661
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:02,240
so they're you know it's a it's a

662
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,798
critical time

663
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:06,400
and it's a important process to get that

664
00:24:04,798 --> 00:24:08,558
uh right so

665
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:10,559
uh so this has been helpful and we have

666
00:24:08,558 --> 00:24:11,678
we have collaborators in many different

667
00:24:10,558 --> 00:24:13,918
countries that are

668
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:15,440
working with it and so we want to

669
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:17,360
develop this further and

670
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:18,798
and have a website that others from

671
00:24:17,359 --> 00:24:21,199
around the world can

672
00:24:18,798 --> 00:24:22,319
input their own weather data directly

673
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:25,519
and then have it run the

674
00:24:22,319 --> 00:24:25,918
simulation model so this is one that

675
00:24:25,519 --> 00:24:29,440
over

676
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:31,759
we began with the model in 1988

677
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:33,840
so it's a overnight process as you can

678
00:24:31,759 --> 00:24:33,839
tell

679
00:24:34,558 --> 00:24:38,960
but you know gradually you have to keep

680
00:24:36,798 --> 00:24:42,319
plugging away

681
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:45,519
okay another one is about the

682
00:24:42,319 --> 00:24:48,480
area of how much water you know do

683
00:24:45,519 --> 00:24:50,158
apple trees need and use and uh you know

684
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:52,720
factors that control it

685
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:54,240
um a couple of the observations that

686
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:57,120
sort of led to the

687
00:24:54,240 --> 00:25:00,640
uh development here one is that a long

688
00:24:57,119 --> 00:25:03,038
time ago in 1980 or so i was

689
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:05,038
working with a colleague in germany and

690
00:25:03,038 --> 00:25:07,359
and we found that the

691
00:25:05,038 --> 00:25:09,359
stomates of apples seem to have an

692
00:25:07,359 --> 00:25:12,399
unusual response to

693
00:25:09,359 --> 00:25:15,678
vapor pressure deficit um

694
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:16,559
and in the in the field in the

695
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:18,240
greenhouse or

696
00:25:16,558 --> 00:25:19,839
growth chamber it's completely different

697
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:21,679
but in the field they don't seem to be

698
00:25:19,839 --> 00:25:22,959
very sensitive to the vapor pressure

699
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:24,000
deficit

700
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:26,159
it's really controlled by the

701
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,000
photosynthesis they're highly coupled to

702
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:30,400
the photosynthesis

703
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,240
uh and then this tied together with

704
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:35,519
terence's observations from

705
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:38,880
irrigation trials that if he used

706
00:25:35,519 --> 00:25:41,278
the normal thing using that monteith et

707
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:42,960
reference and then a fraction of that

708
00:25:41,278 --> 00:25:46,079
the crop coefficient

709
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:47,759
for estimating apple water use and

710
00:25:46,079 --> 00:25:49,119
in some years we're greatly over

711
00:25:47,759 --> 00:25:50,960
irrigating

712
00:25:49,119 --> 00:25:52,239
even though we're using this what it's

713
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:53,919
supposed to be so

714
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:55,440
we're trying to figure out well why why

715
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:56,159
aren't the trees using as much as we

716
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:58,400
expected

717
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:59,520
and so let's see if we can put this

718
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:03,679
together

719
00:25:59,519 --> 00:26:07,200
uh so a student danilo dragoni

720
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:10,440
about 10 years ago or so

721
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:11,759
came worked with us he was a

722
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:12,880
microclimatologist

723
00:26:11,759 --> 00:26:15,519
he really didn't know much about

724
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:17,600
horticulture and i'm not sure he learned

725
00:26:15,519 --> 00:26:19,918
a huge amount about horticulture but

726
00:26:17,599 --> 00:26:21,119
he did some really good work for us on

727
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:24,960
uh

728
00:26:21,119 --> 00:26:27,839
understanding what's going on and so

729
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:29,840
he did a lot of measurements again using

730
00:26:27,839 --> 00:26:32,399
sap flow gauges in the field

731
00:26:29,839 --> 00:26:33,519
and we calibrated them with the balloons

732
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:36,000
and

733
00:26:33,519 --> 00:26:37,918
so went through the season the crop

734
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,640
coefficient is the fraction of that

735
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:41,120
reference

736
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:42,799
that's actually used what we would find

737
00:26:41,119 --> 00:26:45,199
is some you know from day to day we

738
00:26:42,798 --> 00:26:46,079
would see it might be up to 90 or 96

739
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:48,240
percent

740
00:26:46,079 --> 00:26:49,599
and then other days it'd be down to like

741
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:53,200
45 percent

742
00:26:49,599 --> 00:26:54,719
so huge variations from day to day that

743
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:56,400
you know we're trying to figure out what

744
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:58,798
what actually is uh

745
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:00,480
going on here why why isn't that it's

746
00:26:58,798 --> 00:27:01,918
supposed to be fairly constant

747
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:03,599
because the reference is supposed to

748
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:06,799
adjust to the weather

749
00:27:03,599 --> 00:27:10,158
so we had to we

750
00:27:06,798 --> 00:27:11,839
we thought well shockingly grass

751
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:13,520
is maybe not a good model of an apple

752
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:16,000
tree so

753
00:27:13,519 --> 00:27:17,359
we thought well maybe we need to back up

754
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,679
and rather than

755
00:27:17,359 --> 00:27:21,199
using a wrong model and then taking a

756
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:23,038
fraction of a wrong model

757
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:25,200
we might be better off just taking the

758
00:27:23,038 --> 00:27:28,480
original pendant monteith equation

759
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:30,720
of all the physics and then

760
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:31,599
making our own apple specific version of

761
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:35,278
that

762
00:27:31,599 --> 00:27:37,199
and uh and we did that as if

763
00:27:35,278 --> 00:27:39,038
danilo did that i'll take credit of

764
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:43,120
course but um

765
00:27:39,038 --> 00:27:46,240
the this the model response curve here

766
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:46,798
um turns out that in very dry conditions

767
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:49,038
the

768
00:27:46,798 --> 00:27:50,639
the stomate do close due to high

769
00:27:49,038 --> 00:27:53,919
evaporative demand

770
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:56,799
but under moderately dry

771
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:58,320
all the way to very humid conditions it

772
00:27:56,798 --> 00:28:01,599
doesn't respond anymore

773
00:27:58,319 --> 00:28:04,079
to the vapor pressure deficit so if we

774
00:28:01,599 --> 00:28:06,079
use the pendulum on teeth equation we

775
00:28:04,079 --> 00:28:06,720
had to put in a very different boundary

776
00:28:06,079 --> 00:28:09,439
layer

777
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:10,399
of air because a an apple orchard is

778
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:12,640
very very

779
00:28:10,398 --> 00:28:15,038
a lot of turbulent flow so you don't

780
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:16,159
have that still air or like you do over

781
00:28:15,038 --> 00:28:19,038
grass

782
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:19,919
and then we had to adjust because the

783
00:28:19,038 --> 00:28:22,558
trees don't

784
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:23,679
always intercept 100 of the light like a

785
00:28:22,558 --> 00:28:26,480
grass would

786
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:29,679
and then secondly uh or finally we had

787
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:32,159
to put in this unusual stomatal response

788
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:32,880
and when we did we got a very very good

789
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:36,159
model

790
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:39,760
that fit the fit the data very nicely

791
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:42,080
and so from that then we've

792
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:43,519
again gone back to work with art and

793
00:28:42,079 --> 00:28:47,519
keith and

794
00:28:43,519 --> 00:28:49,759
and have an apple uh et model specific

795
00:28:47,519 --> 00:28:51,679
it turns out that humid conditions are

796
00:28:49,759 --> 00:28:53,679
the situation where that

797
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:54,798
that traditional system doesn't work

798
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:56,798
very well

799
00:28:54,798 --> 00:28:58,639
so again the growers can choose their

800
00:28:56,798 --> 00:29:00,798
own location

801
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:02,559
and the data is put in directly and then

802
00:29:00,798 --> 00:29:05,599
the model calculates the

803
00:29:02,558 --> 00:29:08,720
estimated water use and a

804
00:29:05,599 --> 00:29:12,319
and a water balance for the growers

805
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:15,600
okay so so this is the

806
00:29:12,319 --> 00:29:17,839
the output from that um chosen for

807
00:29:15,599 --> 00:29:19,759
say williamson in this particular case

808
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:20,158
so the growers can put in their spacing

809
00:29:19,759 --> 00:29:21,919
and

810
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:23,360
descriptions of the orchard so it can be

811
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:25,440
adjusted for

812
00:29:23,359 --> 00:29:26,719
um if it's a young orchard it'll be

813
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:30,080
smaller

814
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:32,079
so um so now

815
00:29:30,079 --> 00:29:33,278
again just studying how still mates

816
00:29:32,079 --> 00:29:36,720
respond to humidity

817
00:29:33,278 --> 00:29:39,599
has eventually led to a uh a useful tool

818
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:42,880
which is online for growers

819
00:29:39,599 --> 00:29:46,240
okay and then

820
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:48,880
another final one that i want to

821
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:49,839
talk about a bit is that when you work

822
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:52,320
with apple

823
00:29:49,839 --> 00:29:54,319
and grapes and tree fruits and all you

824
00:29:52,319 --> 00:29:56,398
know forest trees also

825
00:29:54,319 --> 00:29:58,240
uh one of the one of the real issues

826
00:29:56,398 --> 00:30:00,959
with uh

827
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:01,839
with understanding the water stress in

828
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,840
these types of

829
00:30:01,839 --> 00:30:06,079
systems well there's really two issues

830
00:30:03,839 --> 00:30:09,359
one is that

831
00:30:06,079 --> 00:30:12,639
the roots of these

832
00:30:09,359 --> 00:30:13,119
different types of perennial plants tend

833
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:15,840
to be

834
00:30:13,119 --> 00:30:16,398
quite erratic they can be they can be

835
00:30:15,839 --> 00:30:20,158
very

836
00:30:16,398 --> 00:30:22,239
uniform so this is this is grape roots

837
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:23,200
uh this is from south africa a couple

838
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:25,839
pictures here

839
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:26,960
uh this is in a very very uniform

840
00:30:25,839 --> 00:30:29,119
friable soil

841
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:30,640
you know about four feet deep and you

842
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:31,918
can see the roots distribute rather

843
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:35,120
nicely

844
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:36,880
but especially grape roots are

845
00:30:35,119 --> 00:30:38,798
they don't have any inherent structure

846
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:41,200
just the way the top doesn't

847
00:30:38,798 --> 00:30:42,480
so they will go wherever the conditions

848
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:44,399
are best

849
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:46,240
and because of that if you happen to

850
00:30:44,398 --> 00:30:50,558
have a plow pan

851
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:52,480
like here or a hard plant pan or uh

852
00:30:50,558 --> 00:30:54,720
you know maybe a perch water table or

853
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:55,839
things like that those root systems will

854
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:57,919
go wherever

855
00:30:55,839 --> 00:30:59,359
the conditions are best and you can't

856
00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:01,200
really predict that very well

857
00:30:59,359 --> 00:31:02,959
and we've dug up a lot of grape roots

858
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:05,679
and you know you

859
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:07,278
uh you just don't know where they are so

860
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:09,519
first of all then trying

861
00:31:07,278 --> 00:31:10,798
on a deep erratic root system you know

862
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:12,159
where do you put your soil moisture

863
00:31:10,798 --> 00:31:15,759
sensor

864
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:17,278
and uh so if you use soil moisture

865
00:31:15,759 --> 00:31:18,079
you're never sure exactly where to put

866
00:31:17,278 --> 00:31:20,640
it and

867
00:31:18,079 --> 00:31:22,240
we found that even things like neutron

868
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:25,519
probe that take a big

869
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:28,558
sample only

870
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:30,720
very generally will respond

871
00:31:28,558 --> 00:31:32,158
very well to the soil moisture and say

872
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:34,798
the photosynthesis or the

873
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:35,760
or the water potential of the of the

874
00:31:34,798 --> 00:31:39,038
plant

875
00:31:35,759 --> 00:31:39,759
um so that's one issue where are the

876
00:31:39,038 --> 00:31:41,599
roots and

877
00:31:39,759 --> 00:31:44,158
you know they may be in different parts

878
00:31:41,599 --> 00:31:46,000
of the soil with different conditions so

879
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:48,480
the other the other thing is that

880
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:51,519
because of the hydraulic resistance

881
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:53,599
with a like especially in apple trees or

882
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:55,759
beaches things like that the hydraulic

883
00:31:53,599 --> 00:31:58,719
resistance is fairly high

884
00:31:55,759 --> 00:31:59,679
in these types of plants what that means

885
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:01,919
is that

886
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:02,880
the water potential in the top of the

887
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:06,159
plant

888
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:08,480
depends not only on the soil but also on

889
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:10,480
the evaporative demand

890
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:11,759
so if you have two days with the same

891
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:14,960
soil moisture

892
00:32:11,759 --> 00:32:17,440
if one of them is a sunny breezy warm

893
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:19,200
dry day the water potential might go to

894
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:21,919
minus 20 bars

895
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:22,880
the next day if it's overcast and humid

896
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:25,360
and cool

897
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:27,519
it may only go to seven bars even though

898
00:32:25,359 --> 00:32:30,479
you have exactly the same soil

899
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:32,319
so because of that need the importance

900
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:34,079
of the evaporative demand

901
00:32:32,319 --> 00:32:35,359
to these perennials we'd like to be able

902
00:32:34,079 --> 00:32:37,359
to measure it directly

903
00:32:35,359 --> 00:32:39,678
in the plant rather than trying to

904
00:32:37,359 --> 00:32:43,199
indirectly measure it in the soil

905
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:46,480
so of course we use pressure bombs

906
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:48,480
pressure chambers excuse me

907
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:50,240
especially if you're having on on an

908
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:53,759
airplane

909
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:55,679
but we so we we go in but obviously

910
00:32:53,759 --> 00:32:57,599
it's sort of like taking your blood

911
00:32:55,679 --> 00:32:59,360
pressure you know once every

912
00:32:57,599 --> 00:33:00,959
week or two weeks you know you get an

913
00:32:59,359 --> 00:33:02,319
instantaneous reading

914
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:04,960
and then the rest of the time it might

915
00:33:02,319 --> 00:33:07,119
be going crazy it depends on whether you

916
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:10,640
just got a grant or just got refused

917
00:33:07,119 --> 00:33:13,038
you know from a grant so you know your

918
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:14,480
blood pressure and the and the water

919
00:33:13,038 --> 00:33:17,119
status of these uh

920
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:18,720
uh plants is very dynamic so if you have

921
00:33:17,119 --> 00:33:19,439
a dynamic system you want to be able to

922
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:22,480
measure

923
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:24,558
very often uh so we need to try to do a

924
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:26,720
continuous measurement

925
00:33:24,558 --> 00:33:29,359
versus you know say a one-time

926
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:31,440
measurement once a week or two weeks

927
00:33:29,359 --> 00:33:32,398
so we'd like to be able to do something

928
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:36,480
where we can

929
00:33:32,398 --> 00:33:40,239
monitor this continuously and

930
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:43,120
it's also a fairly large drop

931
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:44,159
in the water potential during the day

932
00:33:43,119 --> 00:33:45,759
and of course the water

933
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:47,440
status of the plant makes a big

934
00:33:45,759 --> 00:33:49,519
difference in terms of growth

935
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:51,440
and the size of fruit the quality of

936
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:53,599
fruit and especially in

937
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:55,440
wine grapes it's very important for

938
00:33:53,599 --> 00:33:58,000
flavor development

939
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:59,600
and wine quality and in many cases

940
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,919
especially with red grapes

941
00:33:59,599 --> 00:34:03,359
having an intermediate stress is the

942
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:06,799
optimum not

943
00:34:03,359 --> 00:34:08,398
not having too little stress and

944
00:34:06,798 --> 00:34:10,000
you don't want too much stress and shut

945
00:34:08,398 --> 00:34:10,878
don't shut the whole plant down so it

946
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,199
can't

947
00:34:10,878 --> 00:34:13,918
ripen the crop so if you want to have an

948
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:16,799
intermediate

949
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:18,960
stress in a very dynamic situation

950
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:21,519
you've got to have a lot of measurements

951
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:23,519
so we'd like to be able to make a more

952
00:34:21,519 --> 00:34:25,358
of a continuous measurement so

953
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:26,559
the approach that we use and this is in

954
00:34:25,358 --> 00:34:29,598
collaboration with

955
00:34:26,559 --> 00:34:31,599
abe strook who i think we'll be talking

956
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:34,960
next week right

957
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:38,240
he's a microfluidics

958
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:39,199
physics engineer in chemin biomolecular

959
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:40,799
engineering

960
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:42,398
who's been interested in water and

961
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:45,440
plants and

962
00:34:42,398 --> 00:34:48,480
under tension so we had an idea

963
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:49,760
and worked with abe and developed a

964
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:53,039
design and uh

965
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:55,200
vinay has been working for the last 24

966
00:34:53,039 --> 00:34:58,239
years or something you've been here

967
00:34:55,199 --> 00:35:02,159
uh oh four excuse me uh

968
00:34:58,239 --> 00:35:05,279
i'm putting this together uh so

969
00:35:02,159 --> 00:35:08,960
the basic concept is that we have a

970
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:11,119
a normal potentiometer that's been used

971
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:13,358
uh the water and as it's pulled out of

972
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:13,599
this the soil pulls water out you set up

973
00:35:13,358 --> 00:35:15,920
a

974
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:17,039
tension the problem is that of course

975
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:20,480
these fail

976
00:35:17,039 --> 00:35:23,599
with almost a bar is about the maximum

977
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:25,519
range that you get if we're going to do

978
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:28,880
this inside a plant we need to go to

979
00:35:25,519 --> 00:35:30,960
20 or 30 bars type of range

980
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:33,280
so the idea here is to take the same

981
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:36,400
concept of the tensiometer

982
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:40,320
but make a uh make a small chip

983
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:41,440
that actually is a micro version of the

984
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:45,519
tensiometer

985
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:48,559
but with uh with the uh tiny tiny

986
00:35:45,519 --> 00:35:48,960
tubes and a tiny uh volume in there what

987
00:35:48,559 --> 00:35:51,838
um

988
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:53,440
renee what's the volume in the is it

989
00:35:51,838 --> 00:35:57,358
like

990
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:59,760
less than a microliter of water in there

991
00:35:57,358 --> 00:36:01,119
because of these extremely tiny volumes

992
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:03,680
and and all the

993
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:05,760
wall effects uh you can have a much

994
00:36:03,679 --> 00:36:07,519
greater range than you do in a big macro

995
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:09,920
potentiometer so

996
00:36:07,519 --> 00:36:11,358
uh so we've been working uh we started

997
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:13,440
in 2007

998
00:36:11,358 --> 00:36:16,078
again got to be persistent to have

999
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:18,880
overnight success

1000
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:20,320
so we've developed and this is uh sort

1001
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:24,160
of the latest version

1002
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:27,039
of the micro tensiometer

1003
00:36:24,159 --> 00:36:28,399
and the idea being that we'll embed that

1004
00:36:27,039 --> 00:36:31,440
directly into the

1005
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:32,559
into the wood the trunk of the vine or

1006
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:35,760
the tree

1007
00:36:32,559 --> 00:36:37,199
and it's electronic so we have a we have

1008
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:40,560
an output

1009
00:36:37,199 --> 00:36:43,279
that we can electronically monitor

1010
00:36:40,559 --> 00:36:43,279
they're also

1011
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:50,400
they're made by uh using it's called

1012
00:36:47,159 --> 00:36:53,920
microelectromechanical systems or mems

1013
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:55,280
technology which is sort of like chips

1014
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:57,519
integrated circuits but the next

1015
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:59,760
generation integrated devices

1016
00:36:57,519 --> 00:36:59,759
so

1017
00:37:00,559 --> 00:37:07,679
there's vinay in the in the cornell

1018
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:12,240
nano nanofab facility

1019
00:37:07,679 --> 00:37:14,239
very fashionable bunny suits there

1020
00:37:12,239 --> 00:37:16,399
and so he's working with you know a lot

1021
00:37:14,239 --> 00:37:18,078
of very expensive equipment which

1022
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:21,358
occasionally works

1023
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:23,440
and making uh very small devices that

1024
00:37:21,358 --> 00:37:26,239
can be produced on wafers

1025
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:27,599
by robotic uh you know chip type

1026
00:37:26,239 --> 00:37:29,919
manufacturer

1027
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:31,200
and uh there are factories this is

1028
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:33,519
there's actually one in

1029
00:37:31,199 --> 00:37:36,719
uh it's called in photonics in canada

1030
00:37:33,519 --> 00:37:38,639
that can do that type of work

1031
00:37:36,719 --> 00:37:41,519
so the idea being that we can not only

1032
00:37:38,639 --> 00:37:45,838
have a sensor that is

1033
00:37:41,519 --> 00:37:47,838
a very large range i think the maximum

1034
00:37:45,838 --> 00:37:50,480
we've been able to calibrate up to or

1035
00:37:47,838 --> 00:37:54,880
down to about what 200 bars

1036
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:58,000
tension i'm sorry 320 bars

1037
00:37:54,880 --> 00:38:00,320
tension uh is the

1038
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:03,119
so we have about 320 times the range

1039
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:06,720
that the macros

1040
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:08,640
tensiometer has and so it's

1041
00:38:06,719 --> 00:38:10,078
you know it's a huge huge increase in

1042
00:38:08,639 --> 00:38:11,920
that so we're

1043
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:14,079
trying to we're working on the packaging

1044
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:16,000
trying to get this sensor into

1045
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:17,200
forms that we can get into soils and

1046
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:21,599
into

1047
00:38:17,199 --> 00:38:25,199
uh into plants uh but it it does work so

1048
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:26,480
uh this is the uh uh this is where we're

1049
00:38:25,199 --> 00:38:28,960
going and it looks

1050
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:30,240
it looks quite promising we're and we've

1051
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:33,920
got a lot of interest

1052
00:38:30,239 --> 00:38:35,439
uh because there's a good possibility of

1053
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:37,519
potentially a great improvement in the

1054
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:40,000
ability to monitor

1055
00:38:37,519 --> 00:38:42,639
the water stress and optimize the

1056
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:44,079
irrigation efficiency

1057
00:38:42,639 --> 00:38:46,319
and we hope because of that type of

1058
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:48,160
manufacturer with robots and

1059
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:49,440
you know like chip manufacturer reduces

1060
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:50,960
price uh

1061
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:53,280
quite dramatically so we're hoping the

1062
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:57,679
prices can be quite low

1063
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:58,640
and and then agriculture is a huge user

1064
00:38:57,679 --> 00:39:01,039
of water

1065
00:38:58,639 --> 00:39:02,639
and so if we can make even a one percent

1066
00:39:01,039 --> 00:39:05,279
change in the amount of water use

1067
00:39:02,639 --> 00:39:06,319
that can be a very big uh change in

1068
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:09,760
total

1069
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:12,240
so uh those are three of the

1070
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:13,359
uh types of projects that i think you

1071
00:39:12,239 --> 00:39:14,879
know starting out

1072
00:39:13,358 --> 00:39:17,039
just trying to understand the

1073
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:20,640
fundamental behavior of the plant

1074
00:39:17,039 --> 00:39:22,079
uh then but within the context of how

1075
00:39:20,639 --> 00:39:23,358
plants are working in the field and how

1076
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:27,119
we're managing them

1077
00:39:23,358 --> 00:39:27,440
i think uh is is good to be able to get

1078
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:30,400
that

1079
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:32,400
information into a usable form for

1080
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:36,160
growers

1081
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:38,240
okay so i'd like to just go through

1082
00:39:36,159 --> 00:39:39,440
just a bunch of sort of miscellaneous

1083
00:39:38,239 --> 00:39:41,598
thoughts and

1084
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:44,240
and uh things that i think i've learned

1085
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:44,240
over the years

1086
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:48,720
okay the these things that seem to have

1087
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:53,280
either have or

1088
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:54,838
potentially will have a biggest impact

1089
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:57,599
they dealt with a fundamental

1090
00:39:54,838 --> 00:39:58,559
understanding but within the integrated

1091
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:01,359
nature of

1092
00:39:58,559 --> 00:40:02,078
the plants in the natural environment

1093
00:40:01,358 --> 00:40:03,519
because

1094
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:06,000
at least apples and grape you put them

1095
00:40:03,519 --> 00:40:07,759
in a growth chamber they're not the same

1096
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,599
they you know some things are the same

1097
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:12,000
but a lot of in terms of

1098
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:13,119
carbon water those sorts that's more

1099
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:16,159
what i think of as a

1100
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:18,000
quantitative physiology depends a lot on

1101
00:40:16,159 --> 00:40:20,799
the environment

1102
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:22,159
and where there's other things like say

1103
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:23,920
phenological stage

1104
00:40:22,159 --> 00:40:25,358
beginning of ripening of grapes that's

1105
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:28,000
something that will happen in

1106
00:40:25,358 --> 00:40:29,440
in all different conditions so i think

1107
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,920
studying the plant in the

1108
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:33,920
natural environment and how we manage it

1109
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:37,039
i think was important as a context

1110
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:38,318
for the the work uh i didn't have any

1111
00:40:37,039 --> 00:40:41,679
particular

1112
00:40:38,318 --> 00:40:43,599
uh use in mind but i was working

1113
00:40:41,679 --> 00:40:44,879
on the physiology of an important

1114
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:46,079
process

1115
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:47,920
i didn't know how it was going to work

1116
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:49,519
but i i

1117
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:51,200
you know was aware of what the process

1118
00:40:49,519 --> 00:40:52,000
was and what the problem was in the

1119
00:40:51,199 --> 00:40:53,919
field

1120
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:56,960
and i think again that gives a context

1121
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:58,318
that's useful

1122
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:01,519
and the other thing was that none of

1123
00:40:58,318 --> 00:41:03,759
those things were well funded

1124
00:41:01,519 --> 00:41:05,679
matter of fact none of them were the

1125
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:08,720
even the micro sensor which seems

1126
00:41:05,679 --> 00:41:10,559
obvious uh i think it was 12

1127
00:41:08,719 --> 00:41:12,480
i can't remember it's the 12th grant

1128
00:41:10,559 --> 00:41:15,119
proposal that i wrote that actually

1129
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:17,280
finally got funded so

1130
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:18,318
a lot of times these things if you're

1131
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:20,720
studying still mates

1132
00:41:18,318 --> 00:41:22,159
nobody else thinks that you know that's

1133
00:41:20,719 --> 00:41:24,719
going to be very useful

1134
00:41:22,159 --> 00:41:26,960
at least not generally in our field so

1135
00:41:24,719 --> 00:41:29,679
uh so i think it's important to

1136
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:30,400
not be you know if if you think it's

1137
00:41:29,679 --> 00:41:32,639
important

1138
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:35,119
try to find some time you know to work

1139
00:41:32,639 --> 00:41:38,400
on it even if you can't get grants

1140
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:39,838
i know that's much more difficult to say

1141
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:43,358
now but

1142
00:41:39,838 --> 00:41:43,358
but i think it's still true

1143
00:41:43,679 --> 00:41:48,000
team research really is critical if

1144
00:41:45,679 --> 00:41:49,279
you're going to work on complex issues

1145
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:52,079
because there's so many different

1146
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:54,800
aspects that you need to be aware of so

1147
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:56,000
uh i this is i'm not showing pictures of

1148
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:58,000
everybody but

1149
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,519
uh you know terence has done so much

1150
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:02,079
with us for

1151
00:41:59,519 --> 00:42:03,599
a lot of the apple work dave eisenstadt

1152
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:05,119
at penn state we

1153
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:07,519
did a lot of work together with root

1154
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:10,559
biology and understanding that

1155
00:42:07,519 --> 00:42:13,599
and abe stroke and chem

1156
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:16,239
engineering bring in different expertise

1157
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:16,720
not only expertise but then also from

1158
00:42:16,239 --> 00:42:19,598
more

1159
00:42:16,719 --> 00:42:21,039
basic and more fundamental to applied an

1160
00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:23,920
extension that's

1161
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:25,199
equally important too and then it's

1162
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:29,119
important to find

1163
00:42:25,199 --> 00:42:31,598
really good people to work with to

1164
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:33,280
carry these things out so a couple of

1165
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:35,680
the technicians that i've had

1166
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:36,480
steve denning and uh currently rick

1167
00:42:35,679 --> 00:42:39,118
piccione

1168
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:39,838
and rick dunstad and fredonia and we've

1169
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:42,160
had

1170
00:42:39,838 --> 00:42:44,318
visiting scientists and students over

1171
00:42:42,159 --> 00:42:47,440
the years that have done a

1172
00:42:44,318 --> 00:42:49,519
huge amount of extra work and just a

1173
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:52,240
few of those to represent that uh

1174
00:42:49,519 --> 00:42:52,239
important group

1175
00:42:52,639 --> 00:42:58,400
okay some general observation i think

1176
00:42:56,079 --> 00:42:59,760
one thing that we tend to fall a trap we

1177
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:02,400
fall into is

1178
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:03,680
is we come up with hypotheses and they

1179
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:06,720
become our babies

1180
00:43:03,679 --> 00:43:09,199
you know and there's this tendency to

1181
00:43:06,719 --> 00:43:11,759
to really do all you can to prove the

1182
00:43:09,199 --> 00:43:13,279
hypothesis

1183
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:15,119
you know because as you came up with it

1184
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:16,400
and you you know you want you want to be

1185
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:20,240
successful

1186
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:23,200
um but i think this too often we end up

1187
00:43:20,239 --> 00:43:25,279
sort of either uh designing experiments

1188
00:43:23,199 --> 00:43:28,239
that are more likely to give supporting

1189
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:29,040
information where really what we need to

1190
00:43:28,239 --> 00:43:32,318
do

1191
00:43:29,039 --> 00:43:35,279
is we need to be our harshest critics

1192
00:43:32,318 --> 00:43:36,880
we need to do our damnedest to refute

1193
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:38,560
the hypothesis

1194
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:40,000
because it's our hypothesis we know it

1195
00:43:38,559 --> 00:43:43,679
best and

1196
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:44,800
so we should really really try our best

1197
00:43:43,679 --> 00:43:46,719
to disprove it

1198
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:48,640
and if you can't you've got something

1199
00:43:46,719 --> 00:43:50,959
pretty good

1200
00:43:48,639 --> 00:43:53,279
if you say well okay well can we come up

1201
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:56,880
with a condition or situation

1202
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:58,480
in which that's not going to work and

1203
00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:00,079
if you can then there's probably

1204
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:02,639
something wrong with that hypothesis

1205
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:03,200
maybe you need to either throw it out or

1206
00:44:02,639 --> 00:44:06,879
or

1207
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:07,279
modify it but if you if you keep working

1208
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:09,680
through

1209
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:11,040
by trying to disprove these things i

1210
00:44:09,679 --> 00:44:12,559
think in the end you're going to come up

1211
00:44:11,039 --> 00:44:15,838
with a much stronger

1212
00:44:12,559 --> 00:44:17,759
uh hypothesis that that again will be

1213
00:44:15,838 --> 00:44:20,559
closer to that principle that

1214
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:22,400
that emerson said will be able to

1215
00:44:20,559 --> 00:44:24,799
explain a lot of things

1216
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:25,838
so i think there's this tendency and

1217
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:28,560
again

1218
00:44:25,838 --> 00:44:30,480
i think it may be tied in with the um

1219
00:44:28,559 --> 00:44:31,920
with the need to get grants

1220
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:33,838
you know we're writing grant proposal

1221
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:36,960
we're having to be salesmen

1222
00:44:33,838 --> 00:44:37,358
to always trying to sell our our idea to

1223
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:39,838
a

1224
00:44:37,358 --> 00:44:42,719
granting agency something like that and

1225
00:44:39,838 --> 00:44:44,880
so it tends to put us into a positive

1226
00:44:42,719 --> 00:44:46,399
support kind of a thing but

1227
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:48,559
scientifically we need to do the

1228
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:50,639
opposite

1229
00:44:48,559 --> 00:44:51,599
and so i think we have to be careful not

1230
00:44:50,639 --> 00:44:55,598
falling into that

1231
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:56,240
trap um the other thing uh nelson

1232
00:44:55,599 --> 00:44:59,200
charles

1233
00:44:56,239 --> 00:44:59,439
here that um a few of you may have met

1234
00:44:59,199 --> 00:45:01,919
is

1235
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:03,920
uh he was our famous viticulturist and

1236
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:04,639
really the father of canopy management

1237
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:06,720
and

1238
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:08,639
in grapes but he was also a very wise

1239
00:45:06,719 --> 00:45:10,879
man and

1240
00:45:08,639 --> 00:45:12,078
and he really was constantly beating on

1241
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:14,400
us about

1242
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:15,200
be specific about what you're talking

1243
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:17,920
about

1244
00:45:15,199 --> 00:45:19,439
and so things like vigor when he was in

1245
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:20,639
the room you were not allowed to use the

1246
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:24,639
term vigor

1247
00:45:20,639 --> 00:45:26,960
because uh it wasn't clear what it meant

1248
00:45:24,639 --> 00:45:28,799
uh you know you talk to people sometimes

1249
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:30,720
the best way to get

1250
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:34,318
to really focus in on something is

1251
00:45:30,719 --> 00:45:37,358
asking what the what the units are

1252
00:45:34,318 --> 00:45:41,279
you say vigor okay what's the units

1253
00:45:37,358 --> 00:45:42,960
uh you know then it forces you to be

1254
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:44,400
more specific and you know things like

1255
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:45,599
crop load

1256
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:47,838
there's a lot of different ways of

1257
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:50,800
saying crop load and uh

1258
00:45:47,838 --> 00:45:51,599
resistance tolerance quality you know

1259
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:54,240
quality

1260
00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:55,359
is not an attribute of the of the

1261
00:45:54,239 --> 00:45:57,039
product

1262
00:45:55,358 --> 00:45:59,039
you know it's the interaction of that

1263
00:45:57,039 --> 00:46:00,400
product with the expectations of the

1264
00:45:59,039 --> 00:46:02,559
user that's

1265
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:03,680
quality so in a lot of cases we don't

1266
00:46:02,559 --> 00:46:06,000
measure quality

1267
00:46:03,679 --> 00:46:07,118
we might measure attributes related to

1268
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:11,519
quality but

1269
00:46:07,119 --> 00:46:14,640
so it just be try to be more

1270
00:46:11,519 --> 00:46:17,519
specific and uh and

1271
00:46:14,639 --> 00:46:20,239
try not to use so many vague terms or if

1272
00:46:17,519 --> 00:46:23,119
you use them at least define them

1273
00:46:20,239 --> 00:46:25,279
and aristotle had a nice generalities of

1274
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:28,079
the refuge of weak minds

1275
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:28,720
that's maybe a little harsh but uh

1276
00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:32,400
that's

1277
00:46:28,719 --> 00:46:35,838
that's the uh i think the main point

1278
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:38,400
uh of course we you know we have to

1279
00:46:35,838 --> 00:46:39,838
we have to continually use all the tools

1280
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:42,880
that we can

1281
00:46:39,838 --> 00:46:43,679
and uh use them but i i think again in

1282
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:45,440
our

1283
00:46:43,679 --> 00:46:47,519
situation i think it's very important to

1284
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:50,720
use those in the context

1285
00:46:47,519 --> 00:46:52,159
of understanding the whole plant in the

1286
00:46:50,719 --> 00:46:54,318
in the environment that is actually

1287
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:56,318
growing especially if we're

1288
00:46:54,318 --> 00:46:57,679
we're specifically interested in you

1289
00:46:56,318 --> 00:46:58,800
know horticultural crops that we're

1290
00:46:57,679 --> 00:47:01,279
growing

1291
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:02,880
and so molecular biology is really

1292
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:05,519
important to help elucidate

1293
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:06,640
what's going on underneath and we worked

1294
00:47:05,519 --> 00:47:09,519
with susheng

1295
00:47:06,639 --> 00:47:10,639
on understanding what low light actually

1296
00:47:09,519 --> 00:47:13,838
does

1297
00:47:10,639 --> 00:47:17,838
and it and it really does change

1298
00:47:13,838 --> 00:47:20,078
the chemistry and biochemistry of the

1299
00:47:17,838 --> 00:47:23,119
of the plant and it and it helps really

1300
00:47:20,079 --> 00:47:25,119
give a much better understanding

1301
00:47:23,119 --> 00:47:26,720
i think it by itself isn't going to be

1302
00:47:25,119 --> 00:47:29,280
as valuable as as

1303
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:30,239
in context with all the plant physiology

1304
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:33,119
too

1305
00:47:30,239 --> 00:47:33,838
uh and engineering technologies as i've

1306
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:36,240
learned

1307
00:47:33,838 --> 00:47:37,920
working with abe really have us allow us

1308
00:47:36,239 --> 00:47:39,279
to measure things that we had never

1309
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:41,599
really thought about

1310
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:43,280
i know taren's doing work with ct

1311
00:47:41,599 --> 00:47:45,519
scanning to be able to look at

1312
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:48,319
things that we could never see before so

1313
00:47:45,519 --> 00:47:50,400
i think those are really important to

1314
00:47:48,318 --> 00:47:53,279
take those again in context with what

1315
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:56,880
our problems are

1316
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:59,359
and so

1317
00:47:56,880 --> 00:48:00,800
i think we need to move along here um

1318
00:47:59,358 --> 00:48:03,279
okay these are just some

1319
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:04,839
just some quotes that i think i've sort

1320
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:08,480
of collected that i think are

1321
00:48:04,838 --> 00:48:10,639
useful intelligent person is not he who

1322
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:13,440
has the answers but he who knows what

1323
00:48:10,639 --> 00:48:13,440
questions ask

1324
00:48:13,679 --> 00:48:17,279
and the real voyage of discovery lies

1325
00:48:15,838 --> 00:48:20,480
not in seeking new

1326
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:22,720
lands but in seeing with new eyes uh

1327
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:24,800
you know we need to be able to get the

1328
00:48:22,719 --> 00:48:27,358
same information that everyone else sees

1329
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:29,599
and see something different in it than

1330
00:48:27,358 --> 00:48:31,519
everyone else sees

1331
00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:33,680
and actually in our area especially

1332
00:48:31,519 --> 00:48:35,199
palmology and viticulture

1333
00:48:33,679 --> 00:48:38,480
shamans pointed out he said we should

1334
00:48:35,199 --> 00:48:41,759
look for unquestioned answers

1335
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:44,880
as much as for unanswered questions

1336
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:46,240
because we have a lot of dogma and you

1337
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:48,640
look behind it and there's

1338
00:48:46,239 --> 00:48:50,239
many times very little scientific basis

1339
00:48:48,639 --> 00:48:53,358
behind it maybe one

1340
00:48:50,239 --> 00:48:55,358
one paper or something and then there's

1341
00:48:53,358 --> 00:48:56,558
there's a concept called contradictory

1342
00:48:55,358 --> 00:48:58,239
results

1343
00:48:56,559 --> 00:49:00,160
and i think basically i don't think

1344
00:48:58,239 --> 00:49:01,759
there are such things

1345
00:49:00,159 --> 00:49:03,519
i think they're really reflecting our

1346
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:04,960
inadequate understanding of what the

1347
00:49:03,519 --> 00:49:07,119
governing principle is

1348
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:08,318
of that system because if you know what

1349
00:49:07,119 --> 00:49:10,480
the principle is

1350
00:49:08,318 --> 00:49:12,800
then the results may be different but

1351
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:16,559
they're not contradictory

1352
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:18,318
as i pointed out earlier so um

1353
00:49:16,559 --> 00:49:19,680
anyway enthusiasm this is another

1354
00:49:18,318 --> 00:49:22,880
important one

1355
00:49:19,679 --> 00:49:25,199
um there's not a lot of really

1356
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:26,960
there's not a lot of nobel winners that

1357
00:49:25,199 --> 00:49:28,480
weren't pretty darn enthusiastic about

1358
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:31,039
what they were doing

1359
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:32,079
and that enthusiasm is is really

1360
00:49:31,039 --> 00:49:33,920
important

1361
00:49:32,079 --> 00:49:35,839
and i i thought churchill was talking

1362
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:37,440
about science here you know

1363
00:49:35,838 --> 00:49:39,119
success of the ability to go from one

1364
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:40,639
failure to another with no loss of

1365
00:49:39,119 --> 00:49:43,599
enthusiasm

1366
00:49:40,639 --> 00:49:45,838
and so i think that's very important for

1367
00:49:43,599 --> 00:49:45,838
us

1368
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:51,280
anyway so we don't i don't need to read

1369
00:49:49,039 --> 00:49:53,039
all those but

1370
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:54,559
another thing is that as i mentioned

1371
00:49:53,039 --> 00:49:56,719
earlier i think it's quite important to

1372
00:49:54,559 --> 00:49:58,960
do modeling

1373
00:49:56,719 --> 00:50:01,118
and even if you never actually come out

1374
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:04,000
with a mathematical and you know a

1375
00:50:01,119 --> 00:50:06,960
final output i think the process of

1376
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:09,039
trying to say well what is this system

1377
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:11,280
what are the components of this system

1378
00:50:09,039 --> 00:50:12,079
you know just drawing a modeling diagram

1379
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:14,559
i think is a very

1380
00:50:12,079 --> 00:50:16,240
useful thing because you begin to see

1381
00:50:14,559 --> 00:50:18,000
interrelationships that you hadn't

1382
00:50:16,239 --> 00:50:21,358
thought about before

1383
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:21,679
and so um i think it's important though

1384
00:50:21,358 --> 00:50:23,759
to

1385
00:50:21,679 --> 00:50:25,358
remember since they're all great

1386
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:28,640
simplifications

1387
00:50:25,358 --> 00:50:31,279
that all models are wrong

1388
00:50:28,639 --> 00:50:32,639
but some models are useful so the

1389
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:35,200
important thing is to focus on

1390
00:50:32,639 --> 00:50:37,279
usefulness not on the absolute

1391
00:50:35,199 --> 00:50:39,199
perfection of a model

1392
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:41,359
because models can never be perfect or

1393
00:50:39,199 --> 00:50:43,358
they wouldn't be a model because

1394
00:50:41,358 --> 00:50:44,400
you'd have everything described so and

1395
00:50:43,358 --> 00:50:46,480
then

1396
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:48,639
einstein always said make it as simple

1397
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:50,240
as possible but no simpler

1398
00:50:48,639 --> 00:50:52,719
and that's sort of like this finding the

1399
00:50:50,239 --> 00:50:54,639
balance if it gets too complex

1400
00:50:52,719 --> 00:50:56,639
you really can't understand even the

1401
00:50:54,639 --> 00:50:57,759
modeler learns to not be able to really

1402
00:50:56,639 --> 00:50:59,440
understand their

1403
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:01,119
model there's so many interactions that

1404
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:03,838
you just can't keep track

1405
00:51:01,119 --> 00:51:05,599
it's too simple it's just not realistic

1406
00:51:03,838 --> 00:51:08,558
and so you try to find

1407
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:10,240
those key central mechanisms that give

1408
00:51:08,559 --> 00:51:12,319
realistic behavior but are not

1409
00:51:10,239 --> 00:51:14,159
so complex that that you can't

1410
00:51:12,318 --> 00:51:17,920
understand

1411
00:51:14,159 --> 00:51:19,920
the the model and then finally it's

1412
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:23,280
important to remember that models

1413
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:26,000
never provide answers they only provide

1414
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:29,200
quantitative hypotheses

1415
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:30,639
okay so because they're just estimates

1416
00:51:29,199 --> 00:51:32,480
so

1417
00:51:30,639 --> 00:51:34,719
but the important thing is that they're

1418
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:36,639
quantitative hypotheses

1419
00:51:34,719 --> 00:51:38,318
so you can predict that this under this

1420
00:51:36,639 --> 00:51:40,318
condition you should get this much

1421
00:51:38,318 --> 00:51:42,159
dry matter it gives you something that's

1422
00:51:40,318 --> 00:51:44,558
really testable then

1423
00:51:42,159 --> 00:51:45,440
so i i think modeling is a very very

1424
00:51:44,559 --> 00:51:47,920
useful

1425
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:48,880
tool even if you don't get numbers just

1426
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:52,800
uh the

1427
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:56,400
intellectual process so anyway

1428
00:51:52,800 --> 00:52:00,318
so if you can take at least a small

1429
00:51:56,400 --> 00:52:01,760
uh part of your time to pursue ideas

1430
00:52:00,318 --> 00:52:04,719
that nobody else

1431
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:06,720
either understands or would think about

1432
00:52:04,719 --> 00:52:08,879
or would want you to do

1433
00:52:06,719 --> 00:52:09,759
i've had i've had proposals sent back

1434
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:11,280
saying

1435
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:14,319
no you don't get funding and we don't

1436
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:14,319
even want you to do this

1437
00:52:16,639 --> 00:52:20,400
and interestingly 10 years later the

1438
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:23,440
growers came back and said can you

1439
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:25,599
advise me on how to do this so

1440
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:27,679
so sometimes you have to have you know

1441
00:52:25,599 --> 00:52:31,280
confidence in your own

1442
00:52:27,679 --> 00:52:33,358
ideas and this is a

1443
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:35,440
another one about you know don't ask

1444
00:52:33,358 --> 00:52:38,159
what the world need ask what makes you

1445
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:39,679
come alive and go do it because that's

1446
00:52:38,159 --> 00:52:41,759
that's really important rather than

1447
00:52:39,679 --> 00:52:44,960
doing somebody else's ideas

1448
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:47,440
um so anyway be persistent

1449
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:49,358
um you know i started the modeling 25

1450
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:51,440
years ago and it's finally paying off

1451
00:52:49,358 --> 00:52:53,920
now

1452
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:54,559
and you don't have to be as old as i am

1453
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:57,599
to

1454
00:52:54,559 --> 00:53:00,720
get a result but but it

1455
00:52:57,599 --> 00:53:01,920
persistence helps a lot so anyway thanks

1456
00:53:00,719 --> 00:53:04,078
to everybody

1457
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:05,838
and this includes not only the visiting

1458
00:53:04,079 --> 00:53:07,200
scientists but the administrative

1459
00:53:05,838 --> 00:53:09,279
support

1460
00:53:07,199 --> 00:53:11,838
and even our buildings and property

1461
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:13,440
staff in geneva helped me so many times

1462
00:53:11,838 --> 00:53:15,279
with some ideas as to how to do

1463
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:17,039
something so

1464
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:18,319
it really takes quite a large team to

1465
00:53:17,039 --> 00:53:21,679
really have a good

1466
00:53:18,318 --> 00:53:23,759
program like that so anyway thank you

1467
00:53:21,679 --> 00:53:29,838
and it's veterans day so let's remember

1468
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:29,839
our veterans too

1469
00:53:39,119 --> 00:53:46,079
uh yes they're they are

1470
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:47,599
um we have we put in patents on an

1471
00:53:46,079 --> 00:53:49,920
initial design which

1472
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:50,640
worked but is difficult to manufacture

1473
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:53,358
so we've

1474
00:53:50,639 --> 00:53:54,879
modified the design and have a patent uh

1475
00:53:53,358 --> 00:53:56,719
uh pending on that

1476
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:59,200
as well yeah that's all going through

1477
00:53:56,719 --> 00:53:59,199
c-tec

1478
00:54:02,559 --> 00:54:08,000
and theory the potential concern for

1479
00:54:05,519 --> 00:54:10,800
stone fruits is there's a lot of gumming

1480
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:11,358
that you get with injury and so that

1481
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:14,880
that may

1482
00:54:11,358 --> 00:54:17,519
cause an issue uh we're not sure um

1483
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:19,838
apples seem to have a relatively neutral

1484
00:54:17,519 --> 00:54:22,239
kind of wood they don't respond too much

1485
00:54:19,838 --> 00:54:23,759
we put some sensors in and that looks

1486
00:54:22,239 --> 00:54:27,199
like that that we

1487
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:28,800
fairly well grapes we you know we hope

1488
00:54:27,199 --> 00:54:30,480
to get them in grapes but

1489
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:32,800
a lot of times grapes tend to have quite

1490
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:33,280
small trunks especially in our area we

1491
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:36,720
replace

1492
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:39,839
trunks because of winter injury so

1493
00:54:36,719 --> 00:54:40,639
they may be a little bit small but um oh

1494
00:54:39,838 --> 00:54:43,838
in theory

1495
00:54:40,639 --> 00:54:46,719
it could go into corn or other plants

1496
00:54:43,838 --> 00:54:47,838
although annuals rapidly growing and uh

1497
00:54:46,719 --> 00:54:50,239
may not be as

1498
00:54:47,838 --> 00:54:53,838
easy to it seems logical to go in and

1499
00:54:50,239 --> 00:54:56,078
really make crops first

1500
00:54:53,838 --> 00:54:57,119
you make it all sound so easy and yet

1501
00:54:56,079 --> 00:54:59,359
you had said

1502
00:54:57,119 --> 00:55:00,559
it's persistence and enthusiasm and so

1503
00:54:59,358 --> 00:55:03,358
forth are there any

1504
00:55:00,559 --> 00:55:07,839
things that you wish you had time to do

1505
00:55:03,358 --> 00:55:07,838
to get another career

1506
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:17,200
yeah actually that's why i'm retiring

1507
00:55:15,599 --> 00:55:18,798
so i can get away from the committees

1508
00:55:17,199 --> 00:55:19,679
and the reports and then go back to

1509
00:55:18,798 --> 00:55:23,039
doing science

1510
00:55:19,679 --> 00:55:24,960
so yeah

1511
00:55:23,039 --> 00:55:26,079
but one thing i always sort of wanted to

1512
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:29,679
do that

1513
00:55:26,079 --> 00:55:33,440
i never really got around to was

1514
00:55:29,679 --> 00:55:35,838
in in fruit crops when you have

1515
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:36,880
very low root length density like apples

1516
00:55:35,838 --> 00:55:39,279
and grapes

1517
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:39,920
tend to have rootline density in terms

1518
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:43,599
of you know

1519
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:46,559
length of roots in a volume of soil uh

1520
00:55:43,599 --> 00:55:48,960
grass roots might be 500 to a thousand

1521
00:55:46,559 --> 00:55:48,960
times

1522
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:54,559
so you have uh you got one apple root

1523
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:57,838
you got a thousand grape roots

1524
00:55:54,559 --> 00:56:00,319
or uh grassroots for example so that

1525
00:55:57,838 --> 00:56:02,159
but in terms of water use as we showed

1526
00:56:00,318 --> 00:56:05,039
on some of those days

1527
00:56:02,159 --> 00:56:07,279
the apple trees were using ninety

1528
00:56:05,039 --> 00:56:10,318
percent as much as a grass

1529
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:11,839
as an acre of grass so you have about

1530
00:56:10,318 --> 00:56:13,920
the same water use but you're

1531
00:56:11,838 --> 00:56:15,920
sucking that water through maybe one to

1532
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:19,358
one thousand many rooms

1533
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:21,200
so there's the calculations suggest

1534
00:56:19,358 --> 00:56:22,558
there should be localized drying around

1535
00:56:21,199 --> 00:56:24,639
that root system

1536
00:56:22,559 --> 00:56:25,839
in the rhizosphere and that is

1537
00:56:24,639 --> 00:56:29,039
consistent with some

1538
00:56:25,838 --> 00:56:31,358
studies that have been done that

1539
00:56:29,039 --> 00:56:32,719
in the middle of the day even with

1540
00:56:31,358 --> 00:56:37,039
excess irrigation

1541
00:56:32,719 --> 00:56:40,159
150 percent of e.t you're still

1542
00:56:37,039 --> 00:56:42,639
you can still have local drying and

1543
00:56:40,159 --> 00:56:44,000
reduction in water potential so i always

1544
00:56:42,639 --> 00:56:47,759
wondered if i could use a

1545
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:47,760
like a mini rhizotron terran

1546
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:51,358
use a mini rhizotron to actually

1547
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:53,200
visualize

1548
00:56:51,358 --> 00:56:54,400
and see if we could see that load white

1549
00:56:53,199 --> 00:56:56,798
drying

1550
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:57,680
around the roots in these types of

1551
00:56:56,798 --> 00:57:01,039
systems

1552
00:56:57,679 --> 00:57:03,118
because it must be it must be

1553
00:57:01,039 --> 00:57:04,719
drying out the root system but it

1554
00:57:03,119 --> 00:57:06,480
depends on the soil hydraulic

1555
00:57:04,719 --> 00:57:10,480
conductivity

1556
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:12,880
but that's a that's a little bit

1557
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:14,159
we i mean in retirement i'm going to be

1558
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:17,200
mostly following up

1559
00:57:14,159 --> 00:57:20,159
on the micro potentiometer and

1560
00:57:17,199 --> 00:57:20,960
uh and also the models that we've been

1561
00:57:20,159 --> 00:57:24,558
using

1562
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:26,240
we need to continue working on those so

1563
00:57:24,559 --> 00:57:28,480
so i just want more time to do those

1564
00:57:26,239 --> 00:57:28,479
things

1565
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:38,639
back to your philosophical start um

1566
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:40,318
i'm just wondering whether some of what

1567
00:57:38,639 --> 00:57:42,879
you were describing to us isn't a little

1568
00:57:40,318 --> 00:57:45,440
bit towards the bohr

1569
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:46,400
model but your carbon model you you were

1570
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:48,798
saying you didn't

1571
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:49,760
really go into that with a specific

1572
00:57:48,798 --> 00:57:52,318
applied

1573
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:53,920
result you worked on it for 10 years

1574
00:57:52,318 --> 00:57:55,039
confident that it was such a central

1575
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:56,720
mechanism that the

1576
00:57:55,039 --> 00:57:58,558
applications were going to follow and

1577
00:57:56,719 --> 00:58:00,239
you could say that bohr was pretty sure

1578
00:57:58,559 --> 00:58:02,400
that he understood the adversary would

1579
00:58:00,239 --> 00:58:07,039
be a lot of applications

1580
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:07,039
that's true yeah i don't

1581
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:14,079
i i guess the i guess the real uh

1582
00:58:11,039 --> 00:58:16,318
and maybe it's a false

1583
00:58:14,079 --> 00:58:18,000
sentence was that that i was seeing it

1584
00:58:16,318 --> 00:58:19,358
not not from saying well i just want to

1585
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:22,880
study the

1586
00:58:19,358 --> 00:58:25,199
fundamental behavior of plants

1587
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:25,920
you know i want to know why new zealand

1588
00:58:25,199 --> 00:58:28,558
could produce

1589
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:30,639
quite as much and if we understood that

1590
00:58:28,559 --> 00:58:31,519
then hopefully that might give us an

1591
00:58:30,639 --> 00:58:34,879
advance

1592
00:58:31,519 --> 00:58:36,798
being able to maybe improve our

1593
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:38,400
you know our production so and you

1594
00:58:36,798 --> 00:58:39,199
described the back and forth when you're

1595
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:41,920
experienced

1596
00:58:39,199 --> 00:58:43,279
in the modeling yeah so i've seen uh i

1597
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:46,400
think the fact that

1598
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:50,160
i guess i would say the type of actual

1599
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:52,160
work that you do

1600
00:58:50,159 --> 00:58:54,879
might be exactly the same i mean i go

1601
00:58:52,159 --> 00:58:57,519
out and measure say lethal prosensitis

1602
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:59,680
and uh maybe brian chabot measured

1603
00:58:57,519 --> 00:59:02,880
instances of a lot of strawberry now

1604
00:58:59,679 --> 00:59:06,639
again an ecological reason for it i

1605
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:08,640
applied orchard system

1606
00:59:06,639 --> 00:59:11,838
so we did the same techniques but we

1607
00:59:08,639 --> 00:59:14,318
were coming from different directions

1608
00:59:11,838 --> 00:59:16,159
so i think in our particular case i

1609
00:59:14,318 --> 00:59:18,480
found it more useful

1610
00:59:16,159 --> 00:59:21,759
to give that context by starting out

1611
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:24,000
with an issue

1612
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:25,280
of practical importance and then looking

1613
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:27,679
into the fundamental

1614
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:28,640
basis of that and then i think you stand

1615
00:59:27,679 --> 00:59:31,919
a better chance of

1616
00:59:28,639 --> 00:59:32,798
being able to come back the other way

1617
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:35,599
but yeah it's

1618
00:59:32,798 --> 00:59:38,480
like you said it's shifting a little bit

1619
00:59:35,599 --> 00:59:38,480
this way or that way

1620
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:43,680
so why do they produce twice as many

1621
00:59:40,639 --> 00:59:43,679
apples in new zealand

1622
00:59:44,838 --> 00:59:47,838
um

1623
00:59:51,679 --> 00:59:57,759
second the apple leaves do not seem to

1624
00:59:54,880 --> 01:00:00,798
physiologically age

1625
00:59:57,760 --> 01:00:02,400
they can have their s they can be seven

1626
01:00:00,798 --> 01:00:05,358
months old and still have fifty

1627
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:08,240
eighty percent the photosynthesis rate

1628
01:00:05,358 --> 01:00:10,159
that they did when they were born

1629
01:00:08,239 --> 01:00:11,679
so the conditions are good they just

1630
01:00:10,159 --> 01:00:13,679
keep cranking out they're very

1631
01:00:11,679 --> 01:00:16,960
productive

1632
01:00:13,679 --> 01:00:20,960
and so they have an extremely long

1633
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:24,159
uh growing season and they

1634
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:27,519
also the weather conditions the

1635
01:00:24,159 --> 01:00:31,118
carbon balance of the day is optimum

1636
01:00:27,519 --> 01:00:32,960
new conditions that are mostly sunny

1637
01:00:31,119 --> 01:00:34,880
but with some clouds it provides some

1638
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:38,318
confusive radiation around

1639
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:38,960
and then high temperatures in the low

1640
01:00:38,318 --> 01:00:43,279
70s

1641
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:46,000
low to mid-70s

1642
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:47,680
that's optimum for carbon balance so

1643
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:49,679
when we run the carbon as a model

1644
01:00:47,679 --> 01:00:51,919
then we look to see what's optimum you

1645
01:00:49,679 --> 01:00:51,919
know

1646
01:00:52,639 --> 01:00:56,000
a very long growing season which is very

1647
01:00:55,519 --> 01:00:58,639
uh

1648
01:00:56,000 --> 01:01:01,119
very good at adapting to it they also

1649
01:00:58,639 --> 01:01:02,719
have excess sinks

1650
01:01:01,119 --> 01:01:04,318
so that when you have a good condition

1651
01:01:02,719 --> 01:01:06,399
you can add things

1652
01:01:04,318 --> 01:01:07,759
at the beginning so you can take

1653
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:10,480
advantage of it which i think

1654
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:11,760
climate change with the co2 going up i

1655
01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:13,440
think fruit crops are going to be the

1656
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:17,280
ones that will have a big

1657
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:20,720
positive response to it because

1658
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:22,160
at least with like apples the fruit set

1659
01:01:20,719 --> 01:01:23,519
the numbers of fruit depends on the

1660
01:01:22,159 --> 01:01:25,358
carbon balance

1661
01:01:23,519 --> 01:01:27,280
so if you add more carbon you'll

1662
01:01:25,358 --> 01:01:31,119
increase the numbers of fruit

1663
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:33,440
that'll set and then because

1664
01:01:31,119 --> 01:01:35,760
you have an unlimited number of sinks

1665
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:38,240
you maintain the photosynthesis

1666
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:38,880
in the in the leaves they don't down

1667
01:01:38,239 --> 01:01:41,519
regulate

1668
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:44,160
the way you can get in some plants that

1669
01:01:41,519 --> 01:01:47,280
don't have the ability to add sinks

1670
01:01:44,159 --> 01:01:48,558
when you add extra carbon so and there's

1671
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:51,440
been

1672
01:01:48,559 --> 01:01:53,359
unfortunately very few studies that not

1673
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:56,400
been able to give us

1674
01:01:53,358 --> 01:02:00,558
that time type of data season but

1675
01:01:56,400 --> 01:02:03,838
it was a great one that they had about a

1676
01:02:00,559 --> 01:02:08,079
40 percent increase in total drynet

1677
01:02:03,838 --> 01:02:12,078
increase in yield and with no change in

1678
01:02:08,079 --> 01:02:13,440
brightening quality so

1679
01:02:12,079 --> 01:02:16,640
yeah there's quite a few different

1680
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:20,159
factors that i think you guys said

1681
01:02:16,639 --> 01:02:22,480
when the uh apple abort and they drop

1682
01:02:20,159 --> 01:02:24,480
is that an apple itself self-aborting

1683
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:26,240
does it lack enough carbon or the tree

1684
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:28,798
reeling into carbon stress and then

1685
01:02:26,239 --> 01:02:28,798
dropping through

1686
01:02:31,199 --> 01:02:34,879
well it's basically the carbon supply to

1687
01:02:34,239 --> 01:02:37,598
the fruit

1688
01:02:34,880 --> 01:02:38,880
because if you for example shade a whole

1689
01:02:37,599 --> 01:02:41,280
tree

1690
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:42,960
you reduce the light coming in but of

1691
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:44,160
course you've got gradients of light

1692
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:47,039
within the tree

1693
01:02:44,159 --> 01:02:47,838
so the fruit that's in the inside that

1694
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:49,760
might

1695
01:02:47,838 --> 01:02:51,279
already be at twenty percent of outside

1696
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:53,760
light then they're gonna

1697
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:55,920
use even more and then they all fall uh

1698
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:58,880
the ones near the bottom of the tree

1699
01:02:55,920 --> 01:03:01,280
to start i mean the ones up near the top

1700
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:03,358
that are really well exposed

1701
01:03:01,280 --> 01:03:06,079
you know you may reduce the light but it

1702
01:03:03,358 --> 01:03:10,480
doesn't deduce their growth very much

1703
01:03:06,079 --> 01:03:11,280
so it's you start out mostly local

1704
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:15,280
effects

1705
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:17,680
carbon moving but it can move all over

1706
01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:18,480
in the uh in the plant but it starts out

1707
01:03:17,679 --> 01:03:21,919
fairly local

1708
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:26,159
and then but it can move itself

1709
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:26,159
sort of it's not a clear answer

1710
01:03:26,239 --> 01:03:32,239
but it's the reason it's the individual

1711
01:03:28,239 --> 01:03:32,239
fruit's response to its carpeting

1712
01:03:36,159 --> 01:03:40,558
yeah there is the flower buds are

1713
01:03:38,079 --> 01:03:43,760
developing at the same time

1714
01:03:40,559 --> 01:03:45,359
they're initiating the flower bud uh

1715
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:46,160
just about the same time of all this

1716
01:03:45,358 --> 01:03:49,440
fruit drop

1717
01:03:46,159 --> 01:03:53,358
the first month or so after that they

1718
01:03:49,440 --> 01:03:55,599
develop uh the buds in terms of

1719
01:03:53,358 --> 01:03:57,440
all the little tiny structures and

1720
01:03:55,599 --> 01:03:59,359
things that martin kaufman can tell you

1721
01:03:57,440 --> 01:04:02,480
all about it

1722
01:03:59,358 --> 01:04:04,639
and we did find when we looked

1723
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:06,960
we were looking at the effects of

1724
01:04:04,639 --> 01:04:08,719
european spider mites

1725
01:04:06,960 --> 01:04:10,240
reducing the photosynthesis of the

1726
01:04:08,719 --> 01:04:12,639
foliage in

1727
01:04:10,239 --> 01:04:14,078
the beginning of august so we had

1728
01:04:12,639 --> 01:04:17,679
different levels of

1729
01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:19,359
injury and we uh we looked to see

1730
01:04:17,679 --> 01:04:22,078
what did that do to the whole tree

1731
01:04:19,358 --> 01:04:22,639
photosynthesis and then related that to

1732
01:04:22,079 --> 01:04:24,960
the

1733
01:04:22,639 --> 01:04:26,000
fruit development but we also then

1734
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:29,280
looked next year

1735
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:31,838
to see what happened and uh

1736
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:32,798
interestingly we saw we did it in two

1737
01:04:31,838 --> 01:04:36,719
different years

1738
01:04:32,798 --> 01:04:38,559
one year the flower bud initiation must

1739
01:04:36,719 --> 01:04:40,558
have occurred before the mites

1740
01:04:38,559 --> 01:04:42,079
yet because we had a pretty good number

1741
01:04:40,559 --> 01:04:43,920
of flowers

1742
01:04:42,079 --> 01:04:45,920
but once the mice hit they didn't

1743
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:46,480
develop very well so they didn't set any

1744
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:49,760
fruit

1745
01:04:46,480 --> 01:04:51,599
the next year the other year we didn't

1746
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:54,319
get the flowers

1747
01:04:51,599 --> 01:04:55,200
and so we had a low a low crop but when

1748
01:04:54,318 --> 01:04:57,838
we looked at the

1749
01:04:55,199 --> 01:04:59,838
return cropping it correspond very very

1750
01:04:57,838 --> 01:05:02,239
nicely with the carbon balance the

1751
01:04:59,838 --> 01:05:03,119
amount of poultry photosynthesis per

1752
01:05:02,239 --> 01:05:05,519
fruit

1753
01:05:03,119 --> 01:05:08,240
during that later parking season so yeah

1754
01:05:05,519 --> 01:05:11,679
there is there is a lot of interactions

1755
01:05:08,239 --> 01:05:15,199
um between those in it

1756
01:05:11,679 --> 01:05:16,639
and if you so it does appear that those

1757
01:05:15,199 --> 01:05:18,399
flower buds

1758
01:05:16,639 --> 01:05:20,879
even even though they're tiny they can't

1759
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:22,880
require any significant amount of carbon

1760
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:24,880
but they're very small they have a small

1761
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:27,519
demand but apparently are weak

1762
01:05:24,880 --> 01:05:27,519
competitors

1763
01:05:28,079 --> 01:05:32,798
so you know i i don't mean to imply that

1764
01:05:31,119 --> 01:05:35,358
everything is

1765
01:05:32,798 --> 01:05:37,358
carbon water you know it's there's many

1766
01:05:35,358 --> 01:05:39,440
many other factors that go on

1767
01:05:37,358 --> 01:05:40,960
but these are the things that that we

1768
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:44,400
found did poorly

1769
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:44,400
and we were able to model them

1770
01:05:45,920 --> 01:05:51,838
hey anymore from

1771
01:06:03,199 --> 01:06:06,639
this has been a production of cornell

01:06:05,599 --> 01:06:14,000
university
