1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:20,809
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,238 --> 00:00:23,710
University in genomics in biology and in

3
00:00:20,809 --> 00:00:27,229
agriculture but the question is you know

4
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:29,240
what what is the regulatory pathway for

5
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:31,219
those products and what's the consumer

6
00:00:29,239 --> 00:00:33,769
comp which the consumer pathway for

7
00:00:31,219 --> 00:00:35,179
consumer acceptance I don't think I'm

8
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:37,460
going to give you all the answers today

9
00:00:35,179 --> 00:00:39,469
I'm going to provide you only with some

10
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:41,840
new information about what's going on

11
00:00:39,469 --> 00:00:43,519
around those topics and I'll give you

12
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:47,270
some of my thoughts about where I think

13
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:48,710
you need to go and and you know produce

14
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:51,350
therefore a little bit of where I think

15
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:53,539
it will go the future but hopefully

16
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:56,510
provide you a little some different way

17
00:00:53,539 --> 00:00:58,460
to think about these topics as you go

18
00:00:56,509 --> 00:01:03,679
forward and a lot of the work that's

19
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:06,560
done here for now so with that I'm going

20
00:01:03,679 --> 00:01:08,780
to jump right in I'm gonna set the stage

21
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:12,320
a little bit just by the G company what

22
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:14,359
are the different applications there's

23
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:16,099
much about that and then I'm going to

24
00:01:14,359 --> 00:01:17,959
talk I narrowly spent a lot of time on

25
00:01:16,099 --> 00:01:20,750
the regulatory situation both you ask

26
00:01:17,959 --> 00:01:22,579
well give my thoughts on where that

27
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:25,250
should move forward and then talk about

28
00:01:22,579 --> 00:01:27,200
consumer acceptance and transparency of

29
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:29,930
products of this technology with some

30
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:31,130
final thoughts um so what are what did

31
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:33,830
you think what are we talking about

32
00:01:31,129 --> 00:01:35,810
we'll talk about today and she do you

33
00:01:33,829 --> 00:01:38,929
know anything is really the ability to

34
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:41,120
make specific genomic changes in support

35
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:44,720
isn't she know where we can identify a

36
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:46,340
specific location and then identify

37
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:48,950
specific kind of alteration we might

38
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:51,409
want in that location in the genome but

39
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:55,129
it could be an insertion of DNA Alicia

40
00:01:51,409 --> 00:01:57,080
point mutation we don't swap um and it

41
00:01:55,129 --> 00:02:04,369
really does take advantage of the

42
00:01:57,079 --> 00:02:07,219
natural process so there are a number of

43
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:10,490
different tools gene editing tools that

44
00:02:07,219 --> 00:02:12,359
are used to gene edit a genome we have

45
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:15,280
the finger

46
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:17,890
Allen crispers which I put in red

47
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:23,859
because that's the one that everybody

48
00:02:17,889 --> 00:02:25,179
seems to talk about these days today but

49
00:02:23,859 --> 00:02:26,769
I also put down at the end of the slide

50
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:28,480
and there are others and there will be

51
00:02:26,769 --> 00:02:30,640
others in the future I think if I give

52
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:33,219
this thought five years of now there

53
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:35,529
probably will be one or two other gene

54
00:02:33,219 --> 00:02:38,259
editing tools that have been added to

55
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:40,568
that toolbox so as a lawyer as a

56
00:02:38,259 --> 00:02:45,310
regulator when I think about you're not

57
00:02:40,568 --> 00:02:47,048
just going to do that the science is

58
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:49,449
going to keep evolving that it's going

59
00:02:47,049 --> 00:02:51,010
to keep changing out of your dress so I

60
00:02:49,449 --> 00:02:54,158
really wanted to point that out this

61
00:02:51,009 --> 00:02:55,688
isn't a problem and I also wanted to

62
00:02:54,158 --> 00:02:58,000
point out just a little bit about what

63
00:02:55,688 --> 00:03:00,219
gets done because what gets done we

64
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,878
helped us think about how consumers

65
00:03:00,219 --> 00:03:06,908
might accept it regulators like to buy

66
00:03:03,878 --> 00:03:12,548
so this is my one slide that I stole

67
00:03:06,908 --> 00:03:15,638
from somebody so we look at the green

68
00:03:12,549 --> 00:03:18,579
part of the DNA here this is the part of

69
00:03:15,639 --> 00:03:21,010
the that you want to edit so we set up

70
00:03:18,579 --> 00:03:23,500
an RNA molecule that has that sting

71
00:03:21,009 --> 00:03:26,620
animation here now his base pair

72
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:29,859
associated with it enzyme that cuts

73
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:33,250
through that we take that complex put it

74
00:03:29,859 --> 00:03:35,829
into the cell it finds the DNA match and

75
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:42,609
it goes in cuts and at that point we

76
00:03:35,829 --> 00:03:44,530
either like normal occupation before we

77
00:03:42,609 --> 00:03:47,469
get to add DNA at that point you could

78
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:49,449
also put in a specific piece of DNA that

79
00:03:47,469 --> 00:03:51,489
we want to introduce which could be a

80
00:03:49,449 --> 00:03:53,709
whole new gene or it could be a portion

81
00:03:51,489 --> 00:03:56,349
of a gene or code or whatever it wanted

82
00:03:53,709 --> 00:03:58,000
at that stage in the genome so that's

83
00:03:56,348 --> 00:04:01,119
what we're talking about we've done

84
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,829
about gene editing and I want to mention

85
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,810
that not all gene editing is the same

86
00:04:02,829 --> 00:04:08,349
and that I think is very important to

87
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:11,530
the discussion so you can become a

88
00:04:08,348 --> 00:04:13,060
tagine from the same organism or from a

89
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:15,818
different organism with gene editing

90
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:19,449
tools we could have a humanized in one

91
00:04:15,818 --> 00:04:22,348
location or we can even delete if you do

92
00:04:19,449 --> 00:04:31,000
size of one location of

93
00:04:22,348 --> 00:04:32,889
or a huge analogy so so not all

94
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,050
gene-editing is the same you're the

95
00:04:32,889 --> 00:04:36,579
discussion around the regulation of it a

96
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:38,710
lot of times there is this sort of

97
00:04:36,579 --> 00:04:41,430
thought it's all one thing they're doing

98
00:04:38,709 --> 00:04:43,719
the second thing but that's not the case

99
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:47,139
finally I just want to put this in

100
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:50,229
context so gene-editing may be the most

101
00:04:47,139 --> 00:04:52,658
recent way to alter plants and animals

102
00:04:50,228 --> 00:04:53,978
in agriculture but we've been you know

103
00:04:52,658 --> 00:04:56,800
scientists have been using a lot of

104
00:04:53,978 --> 00:04:59,288
different techniques to modify plans

105
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:01,538
have changed the genomes of plants for

106
00:04:59,288 --> 00:05:04,149
traits that are evaluated to agriculture

107
00:05:01,538 --> 00:05:05,949
and this slide so just you know sets

108
00:05:04,149 --> 00:05:10,779
forth a number of those different things

109
00:05:05,949 --> 00:05:12,400
you know when I think about these I've

110
00:05:10,779 --> 00:05:15,939
got a really bad job in this slide

111
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:17,859
convey to you all but when you look at

112
00:05:15,939 --> 00:05:18,879
all these techniques now they've gotten

113
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:21,729
to the point where they all blur

114
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:24,250
together it's no longer able to think

115
00:05:21,728 --> 00:05:26,019
about them on a straight-line continue

116
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:29,860
on to some extent so here we have

117
00:05:26,019 --> 00:05:31,418
different kinds of genes we have you

118
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:34,330
know more classical things like

119
00:05:31,418 --> 00:05:36,370
chemicals or radiation pewter Genesis we

120
00:05:34,329 --> 00:05:38,258
have genetic engineering GMOs its

121
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:40,478
antigenic we have some of the different

122
00:05:38,259 --> 00:05:41,860
gene editing things but I put them on

123
00:05:40,478 --> 00:05:45,568
which one you know which of these are

124
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:45,569
more controllable or less controllable

125
00:05:46,228 --> 00:05:50,439
we can add a gene with these techniques

126
00:05:49,209 --> 00:05:52,989
but we can also add it with this

127
00:05:50,439 --> 00:05:56,800
technique so these things begin to mold

128
00:05:52,990 --> 00:06:00,129
together on the continuum begin to sort

129
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:02,139
of hard to differentiate which is a

130
00:06:00,129 --> 00:06:03,759
lawyer become typically good laws and

131
00:06:02,139 --> 00:06:06,129
regulations like that freight line

132
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:08,590
definitions and it's very hard to have a

133
00:06:06,129 --> 00:06:10,839
bright line definition anymore so

134
00:06:08,589 --> 00:06:12,939
recently the World Economic Forum came

135
00:06:10,839 --> 00:06:14,799
out with a deeper a white paper on vinyl

136
00:06:12,939 --> 00:06:16,930
innovation I just wanted to quote a

137
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:20,348
couple words of this we're talking about

138
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:22,028
this idea of enemy they say there's a

139
00:06:20,348 --> 00:06:24,098
green intervention make up a more

140
00:06:22,028 --> 00:06:26,649
continuous spectrum determining low

141
00:06:24,098 --> 00:06:28,870
versus high levels of genetic alteration

142
00:06:26,649 --> 00:06:30,728
natural versus artificial outcomes with

143
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:32,579
low versus high risk cases this is

144
00:06:30,728 --> 00:06:34,620
becoming a question of judgment on a

145
00:06:32,579 --> 00:06:36,008
continuous spectrum

146
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:37,478
therefore depends

147
00:06:36,009 --> 00:06:40,270
other type of graduated change in

148
00:06:37,478 --> 00:06:41,918
organism editing to produce a product

149
00:06:40,269 --> 00:06:44,618
identical two-month the three

150
00:06:41,918 --> 00:06:47,378
traditional be tentative orthogonal to a

151
00:06:44,619 --> 00:06:48,939
transgenic GMO no longer other clear

152
00:06:47,379 --> 00:06:51,069
directions for transgenic at its

153
00:06:48,939 --> 00:06:53,080
conventional practice biotechnology and

154
00:06:51,069 --> 00:06:54,490
other methods and so forth and so on I

155
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:56,558
think that really captures this idea

156
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:58,899
that these things are all blending

157
00:06:56,559 --> 00:07:02,169
together to some extent and you can't

158
00:06:58,899 --> 00:07:03,610
make those big decisions so with that I

159
00:07:02,168 --> 00:07:04,990
want to briefly just talking about some

160
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:08,830
of the applications are out there so

161
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:10,930
everybody understanding so we have lots

162
00:07:08,829 --> 00:07:12,998
of things in the pipeline on the plant

163
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:18,338
side things like high delayed

164
00:07:12,999 --> 00:07:21,490
soybeans crew Gina a company Alex a high

165
00:07:18,338 --> 00:07:24,908
fiber weeds also from comics we have

166
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:26,499
lower saturated canola oil beef

167
00:07:24,908 --> 00:07:30,598
scientists working on citrus greening

168
00:07:26,499 --> 00:07:34,539
here's a citrus citrus greening disease

169
00:07:30,598 --> 00:07:37,688
using CRISPR we have scientists working

170
00:07:34,538 --> 00:07:39,759
on usaba resistant to Brown Street virus

171
00:07:37,689 --> 00:07:42,249
using this and we're talking about in

172
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:44,528
the top center the United States Asakusa

173
00:07:42,249 --> 00:07:46,930
development countries people trying to

174
00:07:44,528 --> 00:07:49,389
prevent chocolate from extinction using

175
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:50,408
CRISPR so a number of things on the

176
00:07:49,389 --> 00:07:52,300
plant side

177
00:07:50,408 --> 00:07:55,360
considerably we have things on the

178
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:57,189
animal side the hornless cattle is the

179
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:03,749
one that gets the most press down there

180
00:07:57,189 --> 00:08:03,749
I'm taking the allele from dairy cattle

181
00:08:03,838 --> 00:08:11,228
from Angus and from Angus cattle that

182
00:08:09,459 --> 00:08:13,718
are normally heartless and I could put

183
00:08:11,228 --> 00:08:16,360
that into dairy cattle and so that's an

184
00:08:13,718 --> 00:08:18,759
example out there we have one CRISPR

185
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:22,088
that was done to use a lower back pain

186
00:08:18,759 --> 00:08:28,479
and also

187
00:08:22,088 --> 00:08:31,180
swine virus so a number of things I

188
00:08:28,478 --> 00:08:33,370
could have put out forty more slides for

189
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:35,379
things that are all pipeline I know the

190
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:37,209
question with all these becomes a lot of

191
00:08:35,379 --> 00:08:42,338
these are proven concept which of these

192
00:08:37,208 --> 00:08:45,599
will actually so with that background I

193
00:08:42,339 --> 00:08:48,490
wanted to now get into so the regulation

194
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,409
and sort of what is the I'm going to

195
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:52,710
talk about now

196
00:08:49,409 --> 00:08:56,029
what is current situation in both the US

197
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:58,650
and other countries but the times that I

198
00:08:56,029 --> 00:09:03,929
look at district the Tories debate that

199
00:08:58,649 --> 00:09:05,939
goes on as a light switch and most of

200
00:09:03,929 --> 00:09:08,669
the faith that's going on is the

201
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:11,100
question is is the g- product of TMO

202
00:09:08,669 --> 00:09:15,299
which is its regulated light switches on

203
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:18,330
or is it not edgy about it's not

204
00:09:15,299 --> 00:09:19,709
regulated and that is my characterize

205
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:21,800
that I think that's going on around the

206
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:25,170
world that's the debate that's happening

207
00:09:21,799 --> 00:09:27,929
so far the answer to that is unclear

208
00:09:25,169 --> 00:09:30,120
okay most countries it's pretty still

209
00:09:27,929 --> 00:09:32,879
unclear what that is and clearly if we

210
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:35,399
look at all the 200 countries around the

211
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:37,980
world that if there's not a clear thing

212
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:40,079
of things the light switch being on or

213
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:42,480
the likes repeat Bop so with that

214
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:45,090
process what's the story in the u.s.

215
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:47,399
mandatory system and take away from the

216
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:49,410
electric the Tory system is currently it

217
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:52,799
treats g'head in products the same as a

218
00:09:49,409 --> 00:09:54,449
GMO okay I'm going to repeat that it

219
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:58,469
treating other products the same as a

220
00:09:54,450 --> 00:10:01,590
GMO in outfit thank you bye okay from a

221
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:04,220
legal perspective so in order to do that

222
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:08,310
you have a little understanding of

223
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:10,019
United's forty miles so u.s. regulations

224
00:10:08,309 --> 00:10:12,029
didn't engineered crops under the plant

225
00:10:10,019 --> 00:10:13,139
Protection Act and I've always been

226
00:10:12,029 --> 00:10:13,949
driven to know all this or on

227
00:10:13,139 --> 00:10:16,019
regionalist

228
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:17,610
but Plant Protection Act is how they

229
00:10:16,019 --> 00:10:20,279
regulate them what they pissed orally

230
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:21,930
said was you can't release the key to

231
00:10:20,279 --> 00:10:24,029
your crop it's in the environment

232
00:10:21,929 --> 00:10:26,159
without getting the permit from us today

233
00:10:24,029 --> 00:10:27,929
under the Plant Protection Act and

234
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:30,870
eventually you regulate that so that

235
00:10:27,929 --> 00:10:33,089
farmers can grow these permits anymore

236
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:35,879
there trigger their legal trigger what

237
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:37,080
the laws protecting is plant pests so

238
00:10:35,879 --> 00:10:39,269
the law of trying to protect the

239
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:42,000
environment agriculture environment from

240
00:10:39,269 --> 00:10:44,870
introduction of plant pass into the

241
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:47,940
environment and so the trigger has been

242
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:50,100
that a GM crop could be a potential

243
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:52,350
plant s and everywhere needed to be

244
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:54,060
regulated and primarily that was based

245
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:56,399
on the fact that the transformation

246
00:10:54,059 --> 00:10:59,309
vehicle the way you got the new gene

247
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:01,289
into the plant that new trade that was

248
00:10:59,309 --> 00:11:02,949
engineered was through hydro bacteria

249
00:11:01,289 --> 00:11:06,519
and I grow bacteria does

250
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:10,180
isn't listed micro bacterium infects

251
00:11:06,519 --> 00:11:11,799
plants and causes diseases and so that

252
00:11:10,179 --> 00:11:14,409
was the traditional way that they got

253
00:11:11,799 --> 00:11:17,500
the regulation so I can sit here today

254
00:11:14,409 --> 00:11:20,198
and say before 2010 all genetic engineer

255
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:22,419
crops were regulated hygienic engineered

256
00:11:20,198 --> 00:11:24,189
crop unites agent research at a place

257
00:11:22,419 --> 00:11:25,629
like Cornell you couldn't do that

258
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:31,120
research outside of the laboratory

259
00:11:25,629 --> 00:11:32,230
without any permit from USDA after 2010

260
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:36,100
it depends

261
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:38,230
not all Gina not all GMOs or genetically

262
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:40,149
engineered crops which are commodified

263
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:43,149
popular want to call them are currently

264
00:11:40,149 --> 00:11:45,070
regulated at USGS if you use that grow

265
00:11:43,149 --> 00:11:47,828
bacterium as your transformation that

266
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:50,110
are regulated but if you use the gene

267
00:11:47,828 --> 00:11:52,899
gun you're not regulated because the

268
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:55,000
gene gun holistically pushes that DNA

269
00:11:52,899 --> 00:11:58,179
into the cell and you're not using a

270
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:03,100
plant pest so contrary to what people

271
00:11:58,179 --> 00:12:05,409
think that all GMOs are regulated ok and

272
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:07,750
here's an example so there's a dredge a

273
00:12:05,409 --> 00:12:10,659
sorghum that they developed by series

274
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:12,399
biotech company and they went to USDA

275
00:12:10,659 --> 00:12:14,948
means that you know we introduced a

276
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:17,078
foreign gene a gene from a different

277
00:12:14,948 --> 00:12:19,809
species into our sorghum are we

278
00:12:17,078 --> 00:12:23,019
regulated and the USDA said in a letter

279
00:12:19,809 --> 00:12:25,028
back you can use any plant pests in your

280
00:12:23,019 --> 00:12:27,129
construct or in your method of

281
00:12:25,028 --> 00:12:30,009
transformation so you are not regulated

282
00:12:27,129 --> 00:12:32,049
and there are a number of other sorts of

283
00:12:30,009 --> 00:12:33,879
other examples up there none of them are

284
00:12:32,049 --> 00:12:35,948
commercial products yet as far as I'm

285
00:12:33,879 --> 00:12:38,198
aware of but there are other things in

286
00:12:35,948 --> 00:12:40,778
the pipeline that USPS said won't be

287
00:12:38,198 --> 00:12:44,229
regulated so but one of your takeaways

288
00:12:40,778 --> 00:12:45,720
is not all GMOs are regulated in States

289
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:49,060
by USDA

290
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:51,339
similarly people researchers who are

291
00:12:49,059 --> 00:12:53,768
developing gene headed across I've also

292
00:12:51,339 --> 00:12:56,079
gotten the USDA and said am i regulated

293
00:12:53,769 --> 00:12:57,568
so the non ground mushroom the most

294
00:12:56,078 --> 00:13:00,698
popular ones

295
00:12:57,568 --> 00:13:02,860
popular press use crisper and state

296
00:13:00,698 --> 00:13:05,679
research he was CRISPR to make adnan

297
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:08,079
browning to silence a feed and USDA said

298
00:13:05,679 --> 00:13:08,919
you didn't use any plant pests in the

299
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:12,129
process

300
00:13:08,919 --> 00:13:13,208
CRISPR itself CRISPR molecule is not a

301
00:13:12,129 --> 00:13:15,509
plant pass

302
00:13:13,208 --> 00:13:18,878
and so we're not going to rate the later

303
00:13:15,509 --> 00:13:22,360
and similar they said that for years own

304
00:13:18,879 --> 00:13:24,490
camelina oil that was used because

305
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:27,909
forecast night with you that and again I

306
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:29,499
could put up ugly couple dozen of these

307
00:13:27,909 --> 00:13:32,078
that have gone through this a my

308
00:13:29,499 --> 00:13:34,778
regulated process today and said that

309
00:13:32,078 --> 00:13:37,778
they're not regularly so so you'd say

310
00:13:34,778 --> 00:13:41,860
well and as far as I know they've not

311
00:13:37,778 --> 00:13:44,528
said that anymore regulated in fact I'm

312
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:47,769
so Secretary Purdue made a statement

313
00:13:44,528 --> 00:13:49,928
earlier this year where he said and this

314
00:13:47,769 --> 00:13:51,639
is from the press release us does not

315
00:13:49,928 --> 00:13:53,619
regulator have any plans for a date

316
00:13:51,639 --> 00:13:55,568
otherwise have been developed in

317
00:13:53,619 --> 00:13:57,249
traditional breeding techniques as long

318
00:13:55,568 --> 00:14:00,368
as they are not planned pasture develop

319
00:13:57,249 --> 00:14:02,379
using by a mess so and he gives the

320
00:14:00,369 --> 00:14:04,379
example of genome editing so he

321
00:14:02,379 --> 00:14:07,058
specifically said so sort of

322
00:14:04,379 --> 00:14:10,629
memorializes but USDA have been doing

323
00:14:07,058 --> 00:14:12,969
signing as long as it's as long as

324
00:14:10,629 --> 00:14:16,119
there's no plant ask involved it's not

325
00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:18,369
going to be regulate and they then went

326
00:14:16,119 --> 00:14:20,230
on to talk about things that would could

327
00:14:18,369 --> 00:14:22,480
be included with the deletion signal

328
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:25,420
base pairs of stars and so on but again

329
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:27,249
they also have this this caveat of it

330
00:14:25,419 --> 00:14:29,078
that we developed that could be

331
00:14:27,249 --> 00:14:33,040
developed with traditional breeding text

332
00:14:29,078 --> 00:14:35,698
which they didn't define so so that's

333
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:38,409
the current regulatory system in USDA

334
00:14:35,698 --> 00:14:41,169
FDA also regulates genetically

335
00:14:38,409 --> 00:14:43,419
engineered or all our troops and they

336
00:14:41,169 --> 00:14:46,028
currently have a voluntary consultation

337
00:14:43,419 --> 00:14:48,338
process for genetic class where they

338
00:14:46,028 --> 00:14:50,289
will get the genetic engineer plant and

339
00:14:48,339 --> 00:14:51,850
compare it to its vegetable counterpart

340
00:14:50,289 --> 00:14:55,058
and ask whether they're substantially

341
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:56,709
equivalent and today you know there's no

342
00:14:55,058 --> 00:15:00,368
reason not to believe that every single

343
00:14:56,708 --> 00:15:02,888
developers out there that's been through

344
00:15:00,369 --> 00:15:04,990
that voluntary process and that was what

345
00:15:02,889 --> 00:15:06,730
the government I suppose the same thing

346
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:08,678
for gene editing Christ saying you're

347
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:13,119
not required to come in but you could

348
00:15:08,678 --> 00:15:15,730
come in associated but they didn't see

349
00:15:13,119 --> 00:15:18,428
that the phenotypic disadvantage bullets

350
00:15:15,730 --> 00:15:20,860
who its conventional counterpart on the

351
00:15:18,428 --> 00:15:22,688
animal size there is a mandatory

352
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:24,730
pre-market approval process currently

353
00:15:22,688 --> 00:15:26,230
frisson have to execute animals they

354
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:28,829
have done under the new animals blood

355
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:28,829
provision

356
00:15:31,289 --> 00:15:37,509
a new animal drug is defined as anything

357
00:15:35,019 --> 00:15:41,259
that alters the structure or function of

358
00:15:37,509 --> 00:15:43,539
an animal and if you add a gene or you

359
00:15:41,259 --> 00:15:45,610
change the genetics of the cell

360
00:15:43,539 --> 00:15:47,860
you are altering the structure of that

361
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:51,759
cell you're altering the structure of

362
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:52,750
that DNA and so they interpreted that we

363
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:54,429
can argue whether that's a good

364
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:56,250
interpretation or not they've

365
00:15:54,429 --> 00:15:59,138
interpreted that to say therefore

366
00:15:56,250 --> 00:16:01,179
changing the DNA not adding up a key

367
00:15:59,139 --> 00:16:04,570
changes the structure or function of the

368
00:16:01,179 --> 00:16:08,948
animal coming to be different the amount

369
00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:11,410
of mother-approved they also propose the

370
00:16:08,948 --> 00:16:13,179
same treatment 14 other data they said

371
00:16:11,409 --> 00:16:17,889
if you change if you intentionally

372
00:16:13,179 --> 00:16:20,109
change a base pair of the DNA of an

373
00:16:17,889 --> 00:16:21,879
animal you are creating a new animal

374
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:25,149
drug and therefore it also these

375
00:16:21,879 --> 00:16:27,070
particular so that is a proposal that

376
00:16:25,149 --> 00:16:28,539
hasn't been finalized this

377
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:30,730
administration has been they've drawn

378
00:16:28,539 --> 00:16:32,139
that proposal but they also haven't said

379
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:34,060
in yours of things so instead we're

380
00:16:32,139 --> 00:16:35,589
looking into this how we're going to

381
00:16:34,059 --> 00:16:37,869
regulate gene editing products

382
00:16:35,589 --> 00:16:39,850
holistically and they haven't really

383
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:43,089
announced anything so that's the most

384
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:45,550
recent pronouncement from FDA on this

385
00:16:43,089 --> 00:16:50,709
topic so when I look at those together

386
00:16:45,549 --> 00:16:55,028
and there's another agency genetic

387
00:16:50,708 --> 00:16:57,789
engineering profit of pesticides today

388
00:16:55,028 --> 00:16:59,980
um when I look at this regulatory system

389
00:16:57,789 --> 00:17:01,929
what observations do I get well it's not

390
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:03,370
particularly science or Mis based and

391
00:17:01,929 --> 00:17:06,068
I'll argue that it either has

392
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:08,410
over-regulation currently and my example

393
00:17:06,068 --> 00:17:12,548
is so if I change one base pair of a

394
00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:14,769
genetic u of a G go to the crop it's a

395
00:17:12,548 --> 00:17:16,629
voluntary consultation process but if I

396
00:17:14,769 --> 00:17:17,828
change one base pair of an animal it's

397
00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:21,370
on the inventory pre-market approval

398
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:24,338
process I find it hard to argue that

399
00:17:21,369 --> 00:17:26,500
changing one base pair in two different

400
00:17:24,338 --> 00:17:28,808
species can have that very a risk

401
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:30,910
profile that one does a very high level

402
00:17:28,808 --> 00:17:33,730
scrutiny and oversight and one has very

403
00:17:30,910 --> 00:17:35,980
low levels somewhere along the line

404
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:38,140
somebody is being over regulated or

405
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:40,870
somebody's been under regular similarly

406
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:44,710
that we compare to GM of

407
00:17:40,869 --> 00:17:48,819
in the USDA instance if I use the gene

408
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:52,210
gun to introduce a gene to stop citrus

409
00:17:48,819 --> 00:17:53,740
greening it's not regulated if I use I

410
00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:58,240
grow bacterium to introduce that same

411
00:17:53,740 --> 00:18:01,808
gene all night and the same genotype it

412
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:04,120
is regulated and if I get the same

413
00:18:01,808 --> 00:18:06,278
phenotype by the leading and silencing

414
00:18:04,119 --> 00:18:08,798
of genes gene editing I get the same

415
00:18:06,278 --> 00:18:10,659
phenotype and it's not regulated and so

416
00:18:08,798 --> 00:18:12,069
again somewhere along the line topics

417
00:18:10,659 --> 00:18:14,440
either be over regulated by the

418
00:18:12,069 --> 00:18:16,658
regulator so it's hard to argue that

419
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:19,450
this is a science-based risk-based

420
00:18:16,659 --> 00:18:20,710
system whatever your view is of whether

421
00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:23,409
things should be regulated or not

422
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:27,038
regulated the system is existing I think

423
00:18:23,409 --> 00:18:28,240
has lots of flaws in it I also want to

424
00:18:27,038 --> 00:18:30,250
point out that it's not related to

425
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:32,019
foreign DNA in the debate over whether

426
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:34,028
something - chiumbo or not the always

427
00:18:32,019 --> 00:18:36,220
issue is did we introduce some foreign

428
00:18:34,028 --> 00:18:38,380
DNA into it the US regulatory system

429
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:40,569
plays no role whether it's foreign DNA

430
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:43,630
or it's whether it's a plant pest

431
00:18:40,569 --> 00:18:45,428
whether it's a food you know after a lot

432
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:50,169
of other triggers but the trigger is not

433
00:18:45,429 --> 00:18:53,259
whether you have it okay and so what you

434
00:18:50,169 --> 00:18:56,110
have is and that's why I argue they're

435
00:18:53,259 --> 00:18:58,240
treating GMOs and gene and it's the same

436
00:18:56,109 --> 00:19:00,668
from a legal perspective that using the

437
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:03,278
same laws and the same interpretations

438
00:19:00,669 --> 00:19:05,020
of those bars but when they apply them

439
00:19:03,278 --> 00:19:06,009
to the different products you get

440
00:19:05,019 --> 00:19:08,558
different results

441
00:19:06,009 --> 00:19:11,259
so what you'll get is most GMOs and get

442
00:19:08,558 --> 00:19:12,609
regulated by USDA but most genetic

443
00:19:11,259 --> 00:19:15,250
products are not going to get rid of it

444
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:17,769
not because they've been exempt or if

445
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:21,909
I'm insane but because they don't use I

446
00:19:17,769 --> 00:19:25,240
grow bacteria where they don't use quiet

447
00:19:21,909 --> 00:19:27,190
past whereas GMOs use the plant pest but

448
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:29,380
if the gene edited did use a plant

449
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:32,220
density at a plant pest associated with

450
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:35,740
it it would be Rachel and similarly

451
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:37,929
emotions are regulated so you get

452
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:40,929
different results because they're their

453
00:19:37,929 --> 00:19:43,630
legal trigger any change in the DNA

454
00:19:40,929 --> 00:19:47,409
applies equally for both genetically

455
00:19:43,630 --> 00:19:50,500
modified animals she so that's why I say

456
00:19:47,409 --> 00:19:52,899
that they are treated the same legally

457
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:53,960
and regulatory but the outcome may be

458
00:19:52,898 --> 00:19:58,428
different

459
00:19:53,960 --> 00:20:01,370
I to the facts so what's the regulatory

460
00:19:58,429 --> 00:20:03,140
situation in other countries again the

461
00:20:01,369 --> 00:20:06,709
debate is is the light switch on the

462
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:09,740
light switch off so I switched directly

463
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:12,980
to the European heard that was a big

464
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:14,690
issue if there was a court case in front

465
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:17,179
of the European Court of Justice brought

466
00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:19,220
by a French an NGO that went to a French

467
00:20:17,179 --> 00:20:21,350
Court at the French Court certified the

468
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:23,808
issue to the European Court of Justice

469
00:20:21,349 --> 00:20:27,619
which said are gene-editing

470
00:20:23,808 --> 00:20:30,019
props covered by the GMO law the GMO

471
00:20:27,619 --> 00:20:32,389
directive in Europe and this past July

472
00:20:30,019 --> 00:20:35,450
the European Court of Justice said yes

473
00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:36,950
they are cover and what they did and I

474
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:38,630
want to spend a minute on it because I

475
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:41,630
think it's understood by a lot of people

476
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:44,570
what they said was it was pretty much

477
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:46,909
just I did a pretty standard

478
00:20:44,569 --> 00:20:48,558
interpretation on the law so a lot of

479
00:20:46,909 --> 00:20:52,429
people wrote a lot of articles were

480
00:20:48,558 --> 00:20:53,960
written about this flame well this guy's

481
00:20:52,429 --> 00:20:56,059
up I hope they did made a science

482
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:58,730
determination they pretty much five law

483
00:20:56,058 --> 00:21:01,069
complement determine as they interpreted

484
00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:03,349
a law that there's a critique of this

485
00:21:01,069 --> 00:21:05,349
decision the critique is that Parliament

486
00:21:03,349 --> 00:21:08,119
wrote a law that was overly broad

487
00:21:05,349 --> 00:21:10,158
actually provision for this technology

488
00:21:08,119 --> 00:21:12,349
not that the European Court justice kind

489
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:15,230
of probably law but what the court

490
00:21:12,349 --> 00:21:16,879
appearances did was so GMO under the

491
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:18,769
directive is an organism in which the

492
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:21,080
genetic material is altered in a way

493
00:21:18,769 --> 00:21:23,179
that does not hurt naturally by mating

494
00:21:21,079 --> 00:21:25,009
or natural recombination so that's the

495
00:21:23,179 --> 00:21:27,230
definition and under that definition

496
00:21:25,009 --> 00:21:30,528
things like mutagenesis are included as

497
00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:33,589
GMOs under that normal but they're

498
00:21:30,528 --> 00:21:35,179
exempt from the requirements of that law

499
00:21:33,589 --> 00:21:38,990
they don't involve the use of

500
00:21:35,179 --> 00:21:41,450
recombinant DNA molecules are GMOs

501
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:44,419
so the concept is chemical oogenesis

502
00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:46,250
irradiation they do produce a GMO under

503
00:21:44,419 --> 00:21:50,899
the definition but they're exempt

504
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:54,140
because they don't and what the your big

505
00:21:50,898 --> 00:21:56,658
doses court knows is that that in the in

506
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:59,000
the law that Parliament at Parliament

507
00:21:56,659 --> 00:22:00,980
said the reason they did that was these

508
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,690
these other techniques they

509
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:04,999
conventionally used a number of

510
00:22:02,690 --> 00:22:07,429
applications to have a policy to

511
00:22:04,999 --> 00:22:09,919
record so that was a finding of fact on

512
00:22:07,429 --> 00:22:12,769
the European Parliament and so the new

513
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:14,599
European Court Justice said well then

514
00:22:12,769 --> 00:22:16,788
the only really congressman conventional

515
00:22:14,598 --> 00:22:19,368
mutagenic for the long history of safety

516
00:22:16,788 --> 00:22:21,769
and Christopher is a new technique

517
00:22:19,368 --> 00:22:24,499
without that long history of safety so

518
00:22:21,769 --> 00:22:27,769
it doesn't qualify for what they meant

519
00:22:24,499 --> 00:22:29,269
that exclusion to include so you know we

520
00:22:27,769 --> 00:22:31,278
can argue about what they should have

521
00:22:29,269 --> 00:22:33,439
what should be the proper role in the

522
00:22:31,278 --> 00:22:36,618
court wasn't so out of place and I did a

523
00:22:33,439 --> 00:22:38,778
lot of good welcome Joe if you want to

524
00:22:36,618 --> 00:22:40,668
read more about that detail they are not

525
00:22:38,778 --> 00:22:44,239
the only court that's done at some you

526
00:22:40,669 --> 00:22:46,309
zealand as a law about gmos their

527
00:22:44,239 --> 00:22:49,068
hazardous substance and you organize and

528
00:22:46,308 --> 00:22:51,138
they're a GMO is defined as any organism

529
00:22:49,068 --> 00:22:53,209
of any of the genes or other genetic

530
00:22:51,138 --> 00:22:55,068
material has been modified by Hindi from

531
00:22:53,209 --> 00:22:56,689
techniques it's pretty hard to argue

532
00:22:55,068 --> 00:22:59,959
that gene editing is not easy for

533
00:22:56,689 --> 00:23:01,759
technique okay that's part of my DNA and

534
00:22:59,959 --> 00:23:05,328
to something that that's what the quirky

535
00:23:01,759 --> 00:23:08,348
food it said okay I'm on this basis that

536
00:23:05,328 --> 00:23:11,178
signature 1p become more postal order

537
00:23:08,348 --> 00:23:14,088
combination and therefore are covering

538
00:23:11,179 --> 00:23:16,309
under the law so they went back to this

539
00:23:14,088 --> 00:23:18,408
definition and we don't even let should

540
00:23:16,308 --> 00:23:20,989
be the definition of oh or a definition

541
00:23:18,409 --> 00:23:23,089
for a genetically altered

542
00:23:20,989 --> 00:23:25,699
kind of organism but that's what they

543
00:23:23,088 --> 00:23:27,858
were doing so so we have in the

544
00:23:25,699 --> 00:23:30,649
international context several countries

545
00:23:27,858 --> 00:23:33,108
whose laws have been interpreted to

546
00:23:30,648 --> 00:23:34,968
include as GMO

547
00:23:33,108 --> 00:23:37,098
we also have countries like Argentina

548
00:23:34,969 --> 00:23:38,298
which is triple largest in this step

549
00:23:37,098 --> 00:23:40,458
we're gonna look at this a case-by-case

550
00:23:38,298 --> 00:23:42,078
basis but when you go through their

551
00:23:40,459 --> 00:23:44,209
analysis and this may be a little hard

552
00:23:42,078 --> 00:23:46,298
to read but what they're saying is if

553
00:23:44,209 --> 00:23:48,619
you've done a gene that a big drop you

554
00:23:46,298 --> 00:23:50,838
do an early consultation with the

555
00:23:48,618 --> 00:23:55,038
biosafety committee and they're going to

556
00:23:50,838 --> 00:23:57,588
ask you is there a new combination of

557
00:23:55,038 --> 00:24:00,259
genetic material involved in it and if

558
00:23:57,588 --> 00:24:02,598
it is that they say yes it's a GMO

559
00:24:00,259 --> 00:24:05,209
if it's not they're gonna ask cloud you

560
00:24:02,598 --> 00:24:07,489
user fans and is there transgene at the

561
00:24:05,209 --> 00:24:10,399
final product and if there's no Trinity

562
00:24:07,489 --> 00:24:12,019
in the final products and no new DNA in

563
00:24:10,398 --> 00:24:14,599
the final product that it's not going to

564
00:24:12,019 --> 00:24:17,359
be covered and so pretty much it there

565
00:24:14,599 --> 00:24:20,029
is there warranty in their house there's

566
00:24:17,359 --> 00:24:21,740
no foreign DNA in the final product even

567
00:24:20,029 --> 00:24:24,019
if there is an intermediary products

568
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:26,029
that it's not likely to doesn't she I'm

569
00:24:24,019 --> 00:24:28,730
up and you go through an assessment to

570
00:24:26,029 --> 00:24:30,678
comment that so that's what they've done

571
00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:34,130
in several other South American

572
00:24:30,679 --> 00:24:35,929
countries Brazil we have countries like

573
00:24:34,130 --> 00:24:37,910
Israel that also have a similarly

574
00:24:35,929 --> 00:24:41,030
similar regulatory system what they're

575
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:43,730
saying is Walmart on DNA sequences in it

576
00:24:41,029 --> 00:24:45,740
then it's not being regulated but you

577
00:24:43,730 --> 00:24:47,779
and I can also sit out of discussion

578
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:49,970
about but that's really good scientific

579
00:24:47,779 --> 00:24:52,428
may be a good way to deal with the

580
00:24:49,970 --> 00:24:56,298
regulatory situation but you know it's

581
00:24:52,429 --> 00:24:59,570
an all DNA DNA we have genes from other

582
00:24:56,298 --> 00:25:01,369
species and other species have genes in

583
00:24:59,569 --> 00:25:04,129
them from other places and so you know

584
00:25:01,369 --> 00:25:06,158
what is far in this understand we you

585
00:25:04,130 --> 00:25:10,880
know we do that's a fair discussion

586
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:12,289
about that countries like Japan not made

587
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:14,750
a decision yet but a government

588
00:25:12,288 --> 00:25:16,849
committee I said there's certain forms

589
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:19,009
of G never do again most if I when we

590
00:25:16,849 --> 00:25:21,740
give that means single base pair of

591
00:25:19,009 --> 00:25:26,690
deletions but not those more complex

592
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:29,359
things might not be regulated the United

593
00:25:26,690 --> 00:25:32,390
Kingdom interestingly when they were

594
00:25:29,359 --> 00:25:36,439
asked about GM teen editing they argue

595
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:37,940
to European community that if the

596
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:39,440
changes of the DNA could have occurred

597
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:53,029
naturally or the traditional breeding

598
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:55,038
then they would not be during it was

599
00:25:53,029 --> 00:25:58,129
similar to what occurred naturally

600
00:25:55,038 --> 00:26:01,250
traditional breeding such as a single

601
00:25:58,130 --> 00:26:03,559
point mutation then it shouldn't be

602
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:06,409
regulated as a GMO that's what they

603
00:26:03,558 --> 00:26:08,509
argue scientifically but they also said

604
00:26:06,409 --> 00:26:10,700
when they were leaving projects but they

605
00:26:08,509 --> 00:26:13,908
would incorporate the GMO laws of the

606
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:16,519
Union into the new UK lost because they

607
00:26:13,909 --> 00:26:18,289
didn't want to the offset trade with the

608
00:26:16,519 --> 00:26:20,839
EU and they wanted to say that they were

609
00:26:18,288 --> 00:26:22,819
reducing their food safety laws that

610
00:26:20,839 --> 00:26:25,069
their environmental laws so they're

611
00:26:22,819 --> 00:26:27,700
citizens and so now they're in a

612
00:26:25,069 --> 00:26:30,460
quandary because with the European Court

613
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:36,058
they exhibit their apology no law and

614
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:38,528
the Teemo law says that cheetah are GMOs

615
00:26:36,058 --> 00:26:39,548
we'll see where that ends up and then

616
00:26:38,528 --> 00:26:41,319
you have other countries that I don't

617
00:26:39,548 --> 00:26:43,690
think it even got a decision yet but if

618
00:26:41,319 --> 00:26:45,428
you look at their definition of the

619
00:26:43,690 --> 00:26:47,850
Philippines saying and she opposes any

620
00:26:45,429 --> 00:26:51,940
novel combination of genetic material

621
00:26:47,849 --> 00:26:52,298
thank you modern biotechnology that is a

622
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:55,808
lawyer

623
00:26:52,298 --> 00:26:58,929
hoping the logic interpretation Ghana

624
00:26:55,808 --> 00:27:03,638
says an organism that had his own gene

625
00:26:58,929 --> 00:27:05,320
modified without the insertion hard to

626
00:27:03,638 --> 00:27:10,869
argue under that definition you've seen

627
00:27:05,319 --> 00:27:12,788
how to make using any genes modified and

628
00:27:10,869 --> 00:27:14,168
you don't even have to add anything to

629
00:27:12,788 --> 00:27:17,019
do it just the fact that it's been

630
00:27:14,169 --> 00:27:19,330
modified covers it and then we have the

631
00:27:17,019 --> 00:27:20,710
international agreement in this area

632
00:27:19,329 --> 00:27:22,839
that coordinated by our safety protocol

633
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:24,850
which says that modern biotechnology is

634
00:27:22,839 --> 00:27:27,579
individually play acid techniques I

635
00:27:24,849 --> 00:27:29,500
think gene editing qualifies as an

636
00:27:27,579 --> 00:27:31,269
individual a gadget technique the

637
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:33,970
question becomes doesn't overcome

638
00:27:31,269 --> 00:27:36,009
natural production recombination

639
00:27:33,970 --> 00:27:38,019
barriers are not techniques using

640
00:27:36,009 --> 00:27:39,819
traditional breeding clearly is not one

641
00:27:38,019 --> 00:27:41,048
use the traditional breeding but it

642
00:27:39,819 --> 00:27:43,888
produces things similar to traditional

643
00:27:41,048 --> 00:27:49,210
breeding how does that interpretive

644
00:27:43,888 --> 00:27:51,189
unclear in my mind the lawyer so that's

645
00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:53,740
why I said the regulatory situation I

646
00:27:51,190 --> 00:27:56,470
think overall is unclear around the

647
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:58,659
world there's still many decisions to be

648
00:27:56,470 --> 00:28:00,909
made and even in the countries that we

649
00:27:58,659 --> 00:28:04,299
think are clear they're still not I

650
00:28:00,909 --> 00:28:08,590
think the final word so what are some

651
00:28:04,298 --> 00:28:10,418
observations and so I think when you

652
00:28:08,589 --> 00:28:13,658
look at this the government stakeholders

653
00:28:10,419 --> 00:28:15,250
with a population they discuss $2.99 a

654
00:28:13,659 --> 00:28:17,139
month but other things are regulated

655
00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:19,509
based on sort of three triggers they

656
00:28:17,138 --> 00:28:22,148
asked whether there's foreign DNA or

657
00:28:19,509 --> 00:28:23,648
entity in the final product whether the

658
00:28:22,148 --> 00:28:25,959
additive the motive is or could have

659
00:28:23,648 --> 00:28:27,459
been found in nature or whether the edit

660
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:29,440
could have introduced to conventional or

661
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:31,000
traditional breeding chemical

662
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:33,308
mutagenesis or radiation

663
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:35,019
I'm I'm not sure any of those triggers

664
00:28:33,308 --> 00:28:38,109
actually pulls up as a scientific matter

665
00:28:35,019 --> 00:28:40,450
they may hold up as a legal matter but

666
00:28:38,109 --> 00:28:41,109
I'm not sure they really pulled up as a

667
00:28:40,450 --> 00:28:44,710
lawyer

668
00:28:41,109 --> 00:28:46,809
I find things like our DNA or AB in

669
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:48,549
nature or conventional or traditional to

670
00:28:46,809 --> 00:28:50,349
know what the boundaries of those things

671
00:28:48,549 --> 00:28:52,839
are but that is where the debate is

672
00:28:50,349 --> 00:28:55,779
going and that leads to this question of

673
00:28:52,839 --> 00:28:59,669
whether that's on or off um I don't

674
00:28:55,779 --> 00:29:04,779
think my personal view is that a binary

675
00:28:59,670 --> 00:29:08,050
option is a high-risk game because the

676
00:29:04,779 --> 00:29:10,960
likelihood of 180 countries all turning

677
00:29:08,049 --> 00:29:12,849
the light switch off is near zero and

678
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:15,100
once you have a few countries turning it

679
00:29:12,849 --> 00:29:19,209
on then you run into trade issues and

680
00:29:15,099 --> 00:29:21,399
other issues in it and so and and and

681
00:29:19,210 --> 00:29:23,559
when the legs which goes on to get this

682
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:25,900
whole level of oversight that probably

683
00:29:23,559 --> 00:29:28,569
isn't relevant is it the latest of the

684
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:30,970
risk profile did she get a big cross so

685
00:29:28,569 --> 00:29:32,769
you're trying to push the editing into

686
00:29:30,970 --> 00:29:35,400
two different options

687
00:29:32,769 --> 00:29:38,019
neither which fits well the gene editing

688
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:40,360
and so you're putting square pegs into

689
00:29:38,019 --> 00:29:42,279
round holes and you're making a binary

690
00:29:40,359 --> 00:29:45,609
decision I just think that's going to

691
00:29:42,279 --> 00:29:48,160
end up in a bad situation overall do

692
00:29:45,609 --> 00:29:49,929
that interestingly Bill Gates had an

693
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:52,000
article in a journal awhile ago

694
00:29:49,930 --> 00:29:55,049
or talk about 2008 one of the things he

695
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:58,420
said which I liked about it was you know

696
00:29:55,049 --> 00:29:59,680
rule to know that need to go for other

697
00:29:58,420 --> 00:30:02,740
formula to make the treat don't

698
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:04,900
necessarily fit I think that's the that

699
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:07,390
is the key here that we're trying to fit

700
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:10,870
something that doesn't fit and so and

701
00:30:07,390 --> 00:30:12,250
we're doing that in a very risky bag so

702
00:30:10,869 --> 00:30:14,979
my ideas we need to broaden that

703
00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:17,740
discussion between those two options the

704
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:19,509
regulation can take many forms and we

705
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:22,480
have many different kinds of gene of it

706
00:30:19,509 --> 00:30:24,640
we have a silence gene versus 12 silence

707
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:27,610
genes to produce a metabolic pathway

708
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:29,890
versus adding DNA versus from one

709
00:30:27,609 --> 00:30:31,839
species from different species and so we

710
00:30:29,890 --> 00:30:34,330
want more of a science-based crisp

711
00:30:31,839 --> 00:30:35,980
system that has a number of different

712
00:30:34,329 --> 00:30:37,629
buckets forgive them different

713
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:39,730
categories for different types of

714
00:30:37,630 --> 00:30:42,460
products and so the questions you should

715
00:30:39,730 --> 00:30:44,740
be asking are one of the potential risks

716
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:46,059
anything from the process one of the

717
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:48,579
potential risks and anything from the

718
00:30:46,059 --> 00:30:50,289
product state using that process how

719
00:30:48,579 --> 00:30:52,149
does that risk profile compare to other

720
00:30:50,289 --> 00:30:54,220
articles will breeding techniques and

721
00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:55,298
products and then if there are visits

722
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:57,610
that need regulation

723
00:30:55,298 --> 00:31:00,128
what system would be proportionate to

724
00:30:57,609 --> 00:31:01,658
those risks and set up a system based on

725
00:31:00,128 --> 00:31:03,849
those potential risks for those

726
00:31:01,659 --> 00:31:04,539
categories of products that's not what's

727
00:31:03,849 --> 00:31:07,209
going on

728
00:31:04,538 --> 00:31:09,038
interestingly Bloomberg a territorial

729
00:31:07,210 --> 00:31:10,749
that I'd really like I didn't tell them

730
00:31:09,038 --> 00:31:12,700
about this but it's sort of said the

731
00:31:10,749 --> 00:31:15,220
same thing so it was saying a better

732
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:16,480
approach then is a middle course rather

733
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:18,940
than three just the products of a

734
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:20,798
technology regulators your screen and

735
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:23,919
single on those that might need special

736
00:31:20,798 --> 00:31:25,898
monitoring of restrictions the idea that

737
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:29,109
we should have a mandatory system but we

738
00:31:25,898 --> 00:31:31,089
should help smooth the way but that it

739
00:31:29,108 --> 00:31:33,939
wouldn't be either of the systems we

740
00:31:31,089 --> 00:31:35,738
have currently on so that's why I go for

741
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:37,538
this proportionate risk based system and

742
00:31:35,739 --> 00:31:39,819
I'll leave you with this sort of an

743
00:31:37,538 --> 00:31:41,648
example and this is my basis for this is

744
00:31:39,819 --> 00:31:43,028
okay so we have three different products

745
00:31:41,648 --> 00:31:45,368
all three of these products are made in

746
00:31:43,028 --> 00:31:48,128
the pipeline I can't tell you they will

747
00:31:45,368 --> 00:31:50,168
make it out to the market or not but

748
00:31:48,128 --> 00:31:53,048
here we have one gene editing cold

749
00:31:50,169 --> 00:31:55,869
storage potato calyx is using talons and

750
00:31:53,048 --> 00:31:57,819
they've inactivated a single gene so

751
00:31:55,868 --> 00:32:00,878
they silenced the single gene to bridge

752
00:31:57,819 --> 00:32:02,829
this old data we also have another

753
00:32:00,878 --> 00:32:06,089
biotech company that has turned off

754
00:32:02,829 --> 00:32:09,278
three genes to make a hypoallergenic

755
00:32:06,089 --> 00:32:12,249
peanut okay we use the opportunity of

756
00:32:09,278 --> 00:32:14,470
peanuts and we have a third Institute

757
00:32:12,249 --> 00:32:18,009
this one in Spain that's used whisper to

758
00:32:14,470 --> 00:32:19,808
35 different teams 35 different genes

759
00:32:18,009 --> 00:32:23,409
and they're making a gluten reduced

760
00:32:19,808 --> 00:32:25,808
beets so the question is do these three

761
00:32:23,409 --> 00:32:27,190
things have the same level of risk do

762
00:32:25,808 --> 00:32:31,808
they deserve the state level of

763
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:33,909
oversight I don't think they do this one

764
00:32:31,808 --> 00:32:35,888
I may have no problem with we can just

765
00:32:33,909 --> 00:32:38,499
get to no oversight no need for a risk

766
00:32:35,888 --> 00:32:40,079
assessment don't need any government

767
00:32:38,499 --> 00:32:43,149
oversight and they could just stuff a

768
00:32:40,079 --> 00:32:45,158
registry of what's happening here you

769
00:32:43,148 --> 00:32:46,928
know my food safety hat comes on and

770
00:32:45,159 --> 00:32:48,970
says I really want to trust this company

771
00:32:46,929 --> 00:32:51,249
that this is allergen free or do I want

772
00:32:48,970 --> 00:32:53,019
the government cooking and making sure

773
00:32:51,249 --> 00:32:54,669
before that gets out there that that's

774
00:32:53,019 --> 00:32:56,769
an allergen free beyond and that's not

775
00:32:54,669 --> 00:33:00,190
to cause people to go to the hospital as

776
00:32:56,769 --> 00:33:02,349
an allergen illness and this one again

777
00:33:00,190 --> 00:33:04,929
do I worry about the food safety issue

778
00:33:02,349 --> 00:33:06,009
and we starting with 35 genes are there

779
00:33:04,929 --> 00:33:07,340
any other things that have happened

780
00:33:06,009 --> 00:33:10,049
because the clock

781
00:33:07,339 --> 00:33:10,709
you know that we want somebody checking

782
00:33:10,049 --> 00:33:12,450
that out

783
00:33:10,710 --> 00:33:14,279
so my view is these three things get

784
00:33:12,450 --> 00:33:16,830
three different levels of oversight um

785
00:33:14,279 --> 00:33:18,539
they don't get the same but the system

786
00:33:16,829 --> 00:33:21,689
that we proposed would either treat all

787
00:33:18,539 --> 00:33:25,170
of these has no oversight whatsoever for

788
00:33:21,690 --> 00:33:30,059
all of them is GMOs and I think that's

789
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:32,039
what this is for I think so I put this

790
00:33:30,059 --> 00:33:33,899
final quote that by infinite innovation

791
00:33:32,039 --> 00:33:34,710
report that's a populist idea that you

792
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:36,840
want

793
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:38,910
appropriate regulation proportionate

794
00:33:36,839 --> 00:33:41,039
oversight actually helps developers

795
00:33:38,910 --> 00:33:43,410
bring products to market and an

796
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:45,599
independent assessment gives consumers

797
00:33:43,410 --> 00:33:48,150
trust if you have an overly stringent

798
00:33:45,599 --> 00:33:48,899
one with costly regulation that prevents

799
00:33:48,150 --> 00:33:51,509
things have grown through the

800
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:53,580
marketplace and can cause and there's no

801
00:33:51,509 --> 00:33:55,589
oversight consumers question the safety

802
00:33:53,579 --> 00:33:59,519
so we've got to figure out that balance

803
00:33:55,589 --> 00:34:01,889
in this situation if there is no federal

804
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:03,660
regulation what I have we could have

805
00:34:01,890 --> 00:34:05,250
state oversight there are states that

806
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:07,050
could have regulation I think your pops

807
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:09,329
I'm sure they get regulate gene editing

808
00:34:07,049 --> 00:34:11,639
drops so we do have some states

809
00:34:09,329 --> 00:34:13,860
California Minnesota others begin to

810
00:34:11,639 --> 00:34:16,550
regulate this is that better having

811
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:18,659
different states doing things that have

812
00:34:16,550 --> 00:34:20,429
we clearly will have other countries

813
00:34:18,659 --> 00:34:23,309
because I can't guarantee but not

814
00:34:20,429 --> 00:34:26,070
everybody can do it so what will be the

815
00:34:23,309 --> 00:34:28,559
trade impacts of that we still need some

816
00:34:26,070 --> 00:34:30,990
level of organization and do we want the

817
00:34:28,559 --> 00:34:33,360
fact of China so save me don't regulated

818
00:34:30,989 --> 00:34:35,189
here and trying to regulate it our

819
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:38,099
partners and behold it before China

820
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:41,210
proves it too they get to college one of

821
00:34:38,099 --> 00:34:44,789
the good things about regulation of GMOs

822
00:34:41,210 --> 00:34:46,320
we talked about is we regulated here a

823
00:34:44,789 --> 00:34:50,250
lot of countries defer to our

824
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:52,289
regulations so Korea and Japan others

825
00:34:50,250 --> 00:34:54,329
look at armistice definitely say we

826
00:34:52,289 --> 00:34:55,440
don't need to do a second one but we're

827
00:34:54,329 --> 00:34:58,679
not doing anything

828
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:59,970
who are they going to rely upon and if

829
00:34:58,679 --> 00:35:02,579
they don't agree with us that it needs

830
00:34:59,969 --> 00:35:05,759
no regulation and they may be like my

831
00:35:02,579 --> 00:35:07,980
China for the EU and do we want that or

832
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:10,230
we'd rather be the leaders saying what

833
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:12,809
is the level of oversight that goes on

834
00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:14,099
so I'll leave you with that I want to

835
00:35:12,809 --> 00:35:16,170
talk a little bit about consumer

836
00:35:14,099 --> 00:35:18,619
acceptance I think what consumers care

837
00:35:16,170 --> 00:35:19,860
the most about is an assurance of safety

838
00:35:18,619 --> 00:35:22,980
transparency

839
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:24,840
official products so what a different

840
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:27,840
stakeholders the same as you might

841
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:30,180
imagine a lot of the anyhow who said no

842
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:33,570
this this achieved in genetic

843
00:35:30,179 --> 00:35:36,449
engineering 2.0 they said that this is

844
00:35:33,570 --> 00:35:39,980
being promoted the same way they saying

845
00:35:36,449 --> 00:35:43,289
it's the same using dependence on case

846
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:46,230
and so they are only for regulation and

847
00:35:43,289 --> 00:35:48,059
calling for people not to be punished

848
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:51,510
like this the National Organic Standards

849
00:35:48,059 --> 00:35:53,820
Board voted in 2016 to make a

850
00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:56,700
recommendation that you must be a G

851
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:59,039
nothing the excluded methods securing

852
00:35:56,699 --> 00:36:01,829
that has not been accepted yet by the

853
00:35:59,039 --> 00:36:03,029
administration partly organic standards

854
00:36:01,829 --> 00:36:04,980
but you can see where they're felling

855
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:07,050
and you have you know the non-gmo

856
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:09,000
project pretty much saying these are

857
00:36:07,050 --> 00:36:11,100
GMOs and we're not going to include them

858
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:13,769
on the gears their Twitter don't be

859
00:36:11,099 --> 00:36:17,339
fooled products across from new tech

860
00:36:13,769 --> 00:36:20,219
like Tina dating survival are GMOs so

861
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:22,500
either way whether there's regulation or

862
00:36:20,219 --> 00:36:23,569
not and whether the consumer acceptance

863
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:25,289
or not there's going to be a

864
00:36:23,570 --> 00:36:26,789
differentiation in the marketplace

865
00:36:25,289 --> 00:36:29,509
that's already happening

866
00:36:26,789 --> 00:36:33,000
you already see that with some products

867
00:36:29,510 --> 00:36:36,050
that non-gmo project the organic

868
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:38,760
community and you know to some extent

869
00:36:36,050 --> 00:36:41,039
many consumers may not understand these

870
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:42,930
legal signs of extinctions you know you

871
00:36:41,039 --> 00:36:46,019
start explaining to them G nothing they

872
00:36:42,929 --> 00:36:48,089
said there's something about saying oh

873
00:36:46,019 --> 00:36:49,920
it's going to be very hard to make that

874
00:36:48,090 --> 00:36:51,780
distinction and is the foreign gene

875
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:53,970
distinction may be important for

876
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:56,640
regulation whether that will be as

877
00:36:53,969 --> 00:36:59,069
important River acceptance is I think an

878
00:36:56,639 --> 00:37:02,190
open question so you know to me the

879
00:36:59,070 --> 00:37:04,019
factors for consumer acceptance are has

880
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:05,610
it been conveyed by an independent party

881
00:37:04,019 --> 00:37:07,650
these are the questions that extraverts

882
00:37:05,610 --> 00:37:09,450
are going to ask as if it sounds age by

883
00:37:07,650 --> 00:37:11,910
the independent party are there benefits

884
00:37:09,449 --> 00:37:13,589
and who benefits doesn't finish their

885
00:37:11,909 --> 00:37:15,750
view of food if there's a sustainability

886
00:37:13,590 --> 00:37:20,220
and what an influential people they

887
00:37:15,750 --> 00:37:22,920
respects a I'm not saying that those

888
00:37:20,219 --> 00:37:24,809
aren't easy to answer I think there will

889
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:27,809
be many consumers whose role except gene

890
00:37:24,809 --> 00:37:29,460
other than products but I do think that

891
00:37:27,809 --> 00:37:33,210
there's going to be some discussion

892
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:34,199
about it on the issue of transparency I

893
00:37:33,210 --> 00:37:36,030
think

894
00:37:34,199 --> 00:37:38,578
learned as if something didn't

895
00:37:36,030 --> 00:37:41,160
supers they want robot you know didn't

896
00:37:38,579 --> 00:37:42,720
there's some reason it's hidden and for

897
00:37:41,159 --> 00:37:44,279
consumers you want to know which I think

898
00:37:42,719 --> 00:37:46,348
was a very small segment of the

899
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:49,410
population the information needs to be

900
00:37:46,349 --> 00:37:53,970
available so if there's no regulation

901
00:37:49,409 --> 00:37:55,409
out of the food chain supplies my

902
00:37:53,969 --> 00:37:57,269
thought is being in the National

903
00:37:55,409 --> 00:37:59,879
Register so if it's not rounding

904
00:37:57,269 --> 00:38:01,469
mushroom is out there a supermarket

905
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:03,450
chain like Wegmans can go look and say

906
00:38:01,469 --> 00:38:06,389
oh there are mom brownie monsters out

907
00:38:03,449 --> 00:38:08,129
there consumer asks I don't look at

908
00:38:06,389 --> 00:38:10,679
transparency as labeling but I do look

909
00:38:08,130 --> 00:38:13,650
at it is the ability to know what's out

910
00:38:10,679 --> 00:38:15,569
there and so forth one other thing that

911
00:38:13,650 --> 00:38:18,119
I think will impact consumer acceptance

912
00:38:15,570 --> 00:38:21,030
in this area is like all the wild card

913
00:38:18,119 --> 00:38:24,450
which is crisper and G I think is going

914
00:38:21,030 --> 00:38:26,609
to use it human and in gene drives and

915
00:38:24,449 --> 00:38:28,230
conservation areas and how is that going

916
00:38:26,608 --> 00:38:31,289
to affect consumers is that point that

917
00:38:28,230 --> 00:38:32,519
make them more likely to be favorable to

918
00:38:31,289 --> 00:38:34,858
this or less likely

919
00:38:32,519 --> 00:38:38,159
so you have research being done to

920
00:38:34,858 --> 00:38:40,440
correct sickle cell anemia ID number of

921
00:38:38,159 --> 00:38:44,399
different singles single point mutation

922
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:47,250
eye disease genetic diseases in humans

923
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:49,380
if they cure sickle cell anemia that

924
00:38:47,250 --> 00:38:53,608
might really give this a boost it might

925
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:56,309
actually help consumers accept this in

926
00:38:53,608 --> 00:38:59,328
other fields like agriculture but we're

927
00:38:56,309 --> 00:39:02,219
also using gene drives and you know

928
00:38:59,329 --> 00:39:05,430
eradicating bats is Meissen places like

929
00:39:02,219 --> 00:39:08,779
New Zealand to end malaria if this works

930
00:39:05,429 --> 00:39:12,059
again that may pave the way to

931
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:13,980
acceptance if it doesn't work or if we

932
00:39:12,059 --> 00:39:15,900
start creating designer babies or other

933
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:17,429
things it could backfire and could go

934
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:19,440
the other way so I think that's

935
00:39:17,429 --> 00:39:21,449
something a wild card here that people

936
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:24,690
forget about that as opposed to GMOs

937
00:39:21,449 --> 00:39:26,250
which has really been I think there are

938
00:39:24,690 --> 00:39:28,588
ethical issues and a lot of other issues

939
00:39:26,250 --> 00:39:31,050
on other aspects of gene editing that

940
00:39:28,588 --> 00:39:33,630
are gonna overflow into the under

941
00:39:31,050 --> 00:39:36,690
cultural debate people from at least the

942
00:39:33,630 --> 00:39:39,170
public's perception of it and one of the

943
00:39:36,690 --> 00:39:41,220
interesting things which I'll leave you

944
00:39:39,170 --> 00:39:44,460
but you know Commissioner Gandhi that

945
00:39:41,219 --> 00:39:46,199
USDA was talking about gene editing and

946
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:50,269
talking about regulation of it

947
00:39:46,199 --> 00:39:53,849
and pretty much we're saying you know um

948
00:39:50,269 --> 00:39:56,759
I'm I hitting the commissioner I'm in

949
00:39:53,849 --> 00:39:59,759
charge of both human make human drug

950
00:39:56,760 --> 00:40:02,940
therapies as well as al-bakr therapies

951
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:05,460
and if I say that I don't regulate a

952
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:07,619
single base pair change in the animal do

953
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:10,949
I do the same thing for humans which is

954
00:40:07,619 --> 00:40:14,400
the which would be the methods for

955
00:40:10,949 --> 00:40:19,230
solving sickle cell anemia and how do I

956
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:21,750
make the science and when these two

957
00:40:19,230 --> 00:40:24,090
essentials are applied to people I had

958
00:40:21,750 --> 00:40:26,150
never heard anybody in the

959
00:40:24,090 --> 00:40:28,559
administration make this argument before

960
00:40:26,150 --> 00:40:30,599
but it again makes you think about the

961
00:40:28,559 --> 00:40:33,779
bleeding over of these different areas

962
00:40:30,599 --> 00:40:36,059
and well we may want a certain question

963
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:37,890
is an agriculture we also have to worry

964
00:40:36,059 --> 00:40:40,199
that those question is how do those the

965
00:40:37,889 --> 00:40:43,980
president's applying the conservation I

966
00:40:40,199 --> 00:40:46,319
in the human area and I'm not saying

967
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:48,960
that it is one way the other just a

968
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:51,660
point keep in mind that that is

969
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:52,590
something that's in the minds of people

970
00:40:51,659 --> 00:40:54,569
on this issue

971
00:40:52,590 --> 00:40:55,860
so one of my conclusions you know I

972
00:40:54,570 --> 00:40:57,990
think regulation should be made about

973
00:40:55,860 --> 00:41:00,630
science risk these a regulatory

974
00:40:57,989 --> 00:41:03,899
situation right now internationally is

975
00:41:00,630 --> 00:41:05,280
not certain I think the existing laws

976
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:08,670
are having trouble keeping up with the

977
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:11,030
science the last thirty years they

978
00:41:08,670 --> 00:41:13,829
probably say for the next thirty years

979
00:41:11,030 --> 00:41:15,870
that's not you need you biotech um that

980
00:41:13,829 --> 00:41:19,949
there's going to be more concern second

981
00:41:15,869 --> 00:41:21,989
patients because but they're no matter

982
00:41:19,949 --> 00:41:24,929
how them a visual they are and so forth

983
00:41:21,989 --> 00:41:27,149
that's kind of reality and maybe a small

984
00:41:24,929 --> 00:41:28,289
portion and how these techniques have

985
00:41:27,150 --> 00:41:30,930
used and what products are developed

986
00:41:28,289 --> 00:41:32,789
will in time Super seven I still think

987
00:41:30,929 --> 00:41:35,669
in the end if it's a benefit for

988
00:41:32,789 --> 00:41:36,179
consumers consumers benefits very

989
00:41:35,670 --> 00:41:38,789
quickly

990
00:41:36,179 --> 00:41:41,399
the question is what's the benefit for

991
00:41:38,789 --> 00:41:43,289
consumers but if there's a benefit out

992
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:45,510
there that consumers perceive as a

993
00:41:43,289 --> 00:41:48,300
benefit it will fly off the shelf and

994
00:41:45,510 --> 00:41:50,720
nobody's gonna care about whether it's

995
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:53,130
gene edited we modify or anything

996
00:41:50,719 --> 00:41:55,799
the bumbled is to date a lot of the

997
00:41:53,130 --> 00:41:57,750
stuff is more effective firefighters or

998
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:58,560
others um I think in the end game

999
00:41:57,750 --> 00:42:01,440
currencies

1000
00:41:58,559 --> 00:42:03,389
crucial all around I think we've learned

1001
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:05,599
in this internet age that we're in in

1002
00:42:03,389 --> 00:42:08,639
this media ties to the Information Age

1003
00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:09,779
that without transparency people are

1004
00:42:08,639 --> 00:42:12,299
always going to confession

1005
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:14,580
why and that's just gonna automatic

1006
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:17,519
being negative start an uphill battle

1007
00:42:14,579 --> 00:42:55,469
that you don't need the hack so I'm

1008
00:42:17,519 --> 00:42:57,840
going in there the Canada has used to

1009
00:42:55,469 --> 00:43:19,289
have fun in Philly based on the product

1010
00:42:57,840 --> 00:43:22,019
or the implants as well answer that two

1011
00:43:19,289 --> 00:43:23,880
ways first of all the Canadian system is

1012
00:43:22,019 --> 00:43:25,559
right is being done novelty I would

1013
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:29,309
think of at reaching out it across the

1014
00:43:25,559 --> 00:43:30,719
same as a prom did it's novel but the

1015
00:43:29,309 --> 00:43:36,599
product is novel that it could be

1016
00:43:30,719 --> 00:43:40,199
regulated I think they would treat GM

1017
00:43:36,599 --> 00:43:43,799
and GM NGO is insane while the Canadian

1018
00:43:40,199 --> 00:43:45,960
system is long you product based but he

1019
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:49,530
had a friend diagram I'm not aware of

1020
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:52,679
them ever taking a GMO it's not powerful

1021
00:43:49,530 --> 00:43:54,420
it doesn't get regulated so when you

1022
00:43:52,679 --> 00:43:56,699
look at what they've regulated under

1023
00:43:54,420 --> 00:43:59,159
that law you took a Venn diagram

1024
00:43:56,699 --> 00:44:00,809
everything everything that's been GMO

1025
00:43:59,159 --> 00:44:03,569
didn't has been regulated employer to

1026
00:44:00,809 --> 00:44:05,549
other things that are not GMO so

1027
00:44:03,570 --> 00:44:08,240
although it's a product based system

1028
00:44:05,550 --> 00:44:10,800
it's hard to argue that it really is

1029
00:44:08,239 --> 00:44:11,809
independent of process because they've

1030
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:17,120
never exempted

1031
00:44:11,809 --> 00:44:20,869
comments jam up so that's just a side on

1032
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:24,349
it my own take is that the product

1033
00:44:20,869 --> 00:44:28,009
process decision isn't a really a good

1034
00:44:24,349 --> 00:44:29,869
one because well we want to either look

1035
00:44:28,010 --> 00:44:31,790
at both you're doing a mission centering

1036
00:44:29,869 --> 00:44:33,500
we don't just look at the products you

1037
00:44:31,789 --> 00:44:36,739
also look at the process that made that

1038
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:38,690
product that informs the process the

1039
00:44:36,739 --> 00:44:41,269
product how do you do a risk assessment

1040
00:44:38,690 --> 00:44:43,670
of that product so as my example before

1041
00:44:41,269 --> 00:44:47,269
Wilson screening you know if you used

1042
00:44:43,670 --> 00:44:49,070
CRISPR and you don't add a gene that

1043
00:44:47,269 --> 00:44:53,300
bruises a protein you don't need to take

1044
00:44:49,070 --> 00:44:55,730
here now but you use be made a citrus

1045
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:58,310
greening one and you do introduce a gene

1046
00:44:55,730 --> 00:45:00,980
from peanuts then you have a food safety

1047
00:44:58,309 --> 00:45:03,320
issue to look at so that process it's

1048
00:45:00,980 --> 00:45:05,900
not just a phenotype at the end you need

1049
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:08,150
to look at that genotype and that

1050
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:10,550
doesn't call some process associated

1051
00:45:08,150 --> 00:45:14,630
with it so my regular system would have

1052
00:45:10,550 --> 00:45:38,030
a combination of processes one or the

1053
00:45:14,630 --> 00:45:42,110
other so just a comment maybe you can

1054
00:45:38,030 --> 00:45:44,960
respond to it seems like the whole

1055
00:45:42,110 --> 00:45:48,110
argument is white fish focused on

1056
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:50,119
process start medicated on this human

1057
00:45:48,110 --> 00:45:53,599
instincts treat anything that's not

1058
00:45:50,119 --> 00:45:56,960
natural it's not established

1059
00:45:53,599 --> 00:45:59,289
conventional this is fish we asked for

1060
00:45:56,960 --> 00:46:02,829
this aversion to new things right

1061
00:45:59,289 --> 00:46:05,659
because it was not sure if they're safe

1062
00:46:02,829 --> 00:46:12,069
it tend to me that also sort of linked

1063
00:46:05,659 --> 00:46:15,079
to his sense religious right natural

1064
00:46:12,070 --> 00:46:17,390
god-given bounding it's healthy and safe

1065
00:46:15,079 --> 00:46:21,259
right and it may be somehow manipulated

1066
00:46:17,389 --> 00:46:24,159
business so is there is there a way to

1067
00:46:21,260 --> 00:46:24,160
sway public opinion

1068
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:30,100
you didn't answer you know human

1069
00:46:27,489 --> 00:46:32,559
instincts because everybody in this room

1070
00:46:30,099 --> 00:46:36,549
knows that a reader in a few generations

1071
00:46:32,559 --> 00:46:42,509
could produce you know toxic stupid hit

1072
00:46:36,550 --> 00:46:50,039
right through conventional means natural

1073
00:46:42,510 --> 00:46:50,040
reading and then nature is interesting

1074
00:46:50,070 --> 00:46:57,340
is there I think so much about so much

1075
00:46:53,230 --> 00:47:00,130
of the process right now the due process

1076
00:46:57,340 --> 00:47:02,530
risk inherent process comes from this

1077
00:47:00,130 --> 00:47:04,150
deep innate Greensburg part of to the

1078
00:47:02,530 --> 00:47:10,350
nature that has an aversion this truth

1079
00:47:04,150 --> 00:47:10,349
to the middle so is there any chance

1080
00:47:19,769 --> 00:47:32,739
familiar to us we're comfortable with

1081
00:47:22,300 --> 00:47:35,800
things that are new or different and so

1082
00:47:32,739 --> 00:47:39,549
things that are novel and do be you know

1083
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:41,140
raise a hand going back to your little

1084
00:47:39,550 --> 00:47:43,840
two-year-old you want to give them

1085
00:47:41,139 --> 00:47:45,460
something their usual actually say

1086
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:47,350
saying you know it always exchange their

1087
00:47:45,460 --> 00:47:49,720
money said yes later but their initial

1088
00:47:47,349 --> 00:47:51,789
reaction is to say no because they don't

1089
00:47:49,719 --> 00:47:53,859
know what that day I think you don't

1090
00:47:51,789 --> 00:47:55,300
want to be on the safe side and so human

1091
00:47:53,860 --> 00:47:58,390
nature I think is I'm usually the state

1092
00:47:55,300 --> 00:48:00,310
number and so we do regulate things that

1093
00:47:58,389 --> 00:48:01,690
are just not willing to because they're

1094
00:48:00,309 --> 00:48:03,489
not willing do it eventually

1095
00:48:01,690 --> 00:48:05,200
if you don't do they become familiar and

1096
00:48:03,489 --> 00:48:08,369
there's no need to regulate and part of

1097
00:48:05,199 --> 00:48:10,599
that is just consumer confidence and to

1098
00:48:08,369 --> 00:48:12,699
let people feel comfortable with

1099
00:48:10,599 --> 00:48:15,579
something because they don't know about

1100
00:48:12,699 --> 00:48:17,859
it how do you change that

1101
00:48:15,579 --> 00:48:19,949
I mean part of it at the Agricultural

1102
00:48:17,860 --> 00:48:23,170
feeling that that makes you more aware

1103
00:48:19,949 --> 00:48:25,689
you know what what how I come true how

1104
00:48:23,170 --> 00:48:26,920
food gets to their table comes from so

1105
00:48:25,690 --> 00:48:29,110
one of the examples I didn't want to

1106
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:32,530
talk about that what is natural to talk

1107
00:48:29,110 --> 00:48:34,780
ideas I give an example blue I go across

1108
00:48:32,530 --> 00:48:36,850
between an apricot in the claw which is

1109
00:48:34,780 --> 00:48:38,019
the total human invention they can't

1110
00:48:36,849 --> 00:48:41,529
cross that

1111
00:48:38,019 --> 00:48:43,989
naturally but it looks you pick it from

1112
00:48:41,530 --> 00:48:45,730
a tree it looks as natural as can be

1113
00:48:43,989 --> 00:48:47,769
it's a piece of fruit you know it came

1114
00:48:45,730 --> 00:48:50,320
from the tree game of the drought son

1115
00:48:47,769 --> 00:48:52,269
was on it water not much else and yet

1116
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:54,190
you and I know that it's the farthest

1117
00:48:52,269 --> 00:48:55,119
thing from natural whatever natural

1118
00:48:54,190 --> 00:48:57,429
means

1119
00:48:55,119 --> 00:48:59,140
so hopefully with education we in your

1120
00:48:57,429 --> 00:49:01,960
life people can begin to realize that

1121
00:48:59,139 --> 00:49:06,849
there isn't busy while their instinct is

1122
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:09,280
this big dichotomy or this big brave the

1123
00:49:06,849 --> 00:49:10,960
reality is in the biological world that

1124
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:13,660
distinction doesn't exist

1125
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:15,880
everything is continuum and therefore to

1126
00:49:13,659 --> 00:49:17,319
feel more comfortable with text but then

1127
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:19,150
you're always going to have a hesitation

1128
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:20,740
with any defense to whether it's

1129
00:49:19,150 --> 00:49:23,530
biological or other kinds of things

1130
00:49:20,739 --> 00:49:29,349
unless there's a major benefit some cell

1131
00:49:23,530 --> 00:49:34,470
phones everybody I go back up

1132
00:49:29,349 --> 00:49:34,469
pasteurization which was a new technique

1133
00:49:38,429 --> 00:49:46,569
used a key benefits to people eventually

1134
00:49:42,219 --> 00:50:41,349
became the norm so the hope is that some

1135
00:49:46,570 --> 00:50:49,090
of these be years ago does change but it

1136
00:50:41,349 --> 00:50:51,750
is little I mean I'm talking about a the

1137
00:50:49,090 --> 00:50:56,410
switch oh no GMO

1138
00:50:51,750 --> 00:50:58,980
how you make swallow holy syllables

1139
00:50:56,409 --> 00:51:01,980
countries where people have great

1140
00:50:58,980 --> 00:51:01,980
abilities

1141
00:51:04,088 --> 00:51:28,989
I mean sure in reference to what you

1142
00:51:24,130 --> 00:51:57,190
were just saying I understand that this

1143
00:51:28,989 --> 00:52:01,659
is always I think that speaks more to -

1144
00:51:57,190 --> 00:52:05,139
why are we it hasn't always worked

1145
00:52:01,659 --> 00:52:08,469
further and so we do need some relation

1146
00:52:05,139 --> 00:52:11,318
and it's not just religion or scary

1147
00:52:08,469 --> 00:52:32,289
science necessarily but every once in a

1148
00:52:11,318 --> 00:52:40,199
while I think the public is willing to

1149
00:52:32,289 --> 00:52:44,019
accept mistakes correct all the nine

1150
00:52:40,199 --> 00:52:45,969
when some of the examples that I might

1151
00:52:44,019 --> 00:52:48,579
get where it's really hard to college is

1152
00:52:45,969 --> 00:52:51,219
when things have been hit people didn't

1153
00:52:48,579 --> 00:52:54,550
acknowledge some of those uncertainties

1154
00:52:51,219 --> 00:52:56,769
or when things were found to be public

1155
00:52:54,550 --> 00:52:59,050
they didn't release that information and

1156
00:52:56,769 --> 00:53:01,838
they hold it back things like that and

1157
00:52:59,050 --> 00:53:03,609
that's where the public good comes very

1158
00:53:01,838 --> 00:53:05,549
very uncertain about things in the

1159
00:53:03,608 --> 00:53:08,279
future so that's why I think the change

1160
00:53:05,550 --> 00:53:10,740
the effects of key critical events

1161
00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:12,840
because I think I'm I knew is a

1162
00:53:10,739 --> 00:53:14,279
regulator or the scientist can get it

1163
00:53:12,840 --> 00:53:17,070
wrong but if they were upfront about

1164
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:18,900
things the public will forgive them but

1165
00:53:17,070 --> 00:53:21,750
if they weren't up front about it and

1166
00:53:18,900 --> 00:53:24,440
they won't forgive it and it kind of

1167
00:53:21,750 --> 00:53:28,380
thing that's my own view on it but

1168
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:30,360
that's up for debate in the end for

1169
00:53:28,380 --> 00:53:32,820
Africa for other countries if you have

1170
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:34,710
don't have a predatory system so I think

1171
00:53:32,820 --> 00:53:36,480
the ones that point out most of those

1172
00:53:34,710 --> 00:53:39,480
laws and most other definitions we're

1173
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:42,630
done before Gina even existed so the

1174
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:44,639
network we're applying an old law a new

1175
00:53:42,630 --> 00:53:47,610
technique I think we're getting gaps and

1176
00:53:44,639 --> 00:53:49,079
ambiguities and not good fixes and

1177
00:53:47,610 --> 00:53:50,220
nobody thought about when they made

1178
00:53:49,079 --> 00:53:52,559
those definitions that there would be

1179
00:53:50,219 --> 00:53:55,259
this technique if you're doing a law now

1180
00:53:52,559 --> 00:53:59,130
I think you have to consider your

1181
00:53:55,260 --> 00:54:00,600
definition you can now understand these

1182
00:53:59,130 --> 00:54:04,380
other techniques and decide to include

1183
00:54:00,599 --> 00:54:06,389
the consciousness whether to do that so

1184
00:54:04,380 --> 00:54:07,800
I think that's the difference but you

1185
00:54:06,389 --> 00:54:09,299
also have to realize it in those

1186
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:10,560
countries that ten years from now

1187
00:54:09,300 --> 00:54:12,480
there's going to be something else new

1188
00:54:10,559 --> 00:54:13,829
they're different so you have to have

1189
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:16,110
unions I'm never going to go to predict

1190
00:54:13,829 --> 00:54:20,400
what that is but you don't want to write

1191
00:54:16,110 --> 00:54:22,110
your language in such a way you might

1192
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:24,570
not want to capture it in future so you

1193
00:54:22,110 --> 00:54:26,550
have some flexibility built into that

1194
00:54:24,570 --> 00:54:29,250
system some of these definitions are

1195
00:54:26,550 --> 00:54:31,200
pretty inflexible there are countries

1196
00:54:29,250 --> 00:54:33,599
that by the definition for they allow

1197
00:54:31,199 --> 00:54:35,819
the regulator to exempt things and

1198
00:54:33,599 --> 00:54:39,599
modify things through regulation will be

1199
00:54:35,820 --> 00:54:41,100
power as these become more conventional

1200
00:54:39,599 --> 00:54:43,980
as people who know more comfortable as

1201
00:54:41,099 --> 00:54:45,719
do good regulatory systems would say to

1202
00:54:43,980 --> 00:54:48,000
put it's a lot of business that founder

1203
00:54:45,719 --> 00:54:49,230
while it's finding that everything is

1204
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:51,630
saying that you dealt with the

1205
00:54:49,230 --> 00:54:54,559
deregulate those vacuum regulation

1206
00:54:51,630 --> 00:54:57,079
without having to go back to Parliament

1207
00:54:54,559 --> 00:54:59,519
so there are ways you can do it

1208
00:54:57,079 --> 00:55:02,239
hopefully we learn and we do better jobs

1209
00:54:59,519 --> 00:55:02,239
and power
