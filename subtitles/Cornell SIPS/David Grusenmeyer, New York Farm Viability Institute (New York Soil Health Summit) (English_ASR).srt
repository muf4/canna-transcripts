1
00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:04,600
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,218 --> 00:00:07,390
University

3
00:00:04,599 --> 00:00:08,468
ah gee um Dave Grusin my executive

4
00:00:07,389 --> 00:00:10,660
director of New York farm viability

5
00:00:08,468 --> 00:00:13,019
institute and again also thinking

6
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:15,638
Cornell four minutes together and

7
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:17,769
developing the program I'll give you a

8
00:00:15,638 --> 00:00:19,448
little background about reliability for

9
00:00:17,769 --> 00:00:21,570
those of you that part aware and then

10
00:00:19,449 --> 00:00:25,870
talk a little bit about our role in

11
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:27,730
Slough projects over the years so far

12
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:30,339
mobility started as a grant from USDA

13
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:32,378
Rural Development in 2003 to Cornell for

14
00:00:30,339 --> 00:00:35,109
an Ag Innovation Center was one of ten

15
00:00:32,378 --> 00:00:37,869
grants across the United States and it

16
00:00:35,109 --> 00:00:40,329
is the only remnant of that program

17
00:00:37,869 --> 00:00:42,578
that's still in operation as that grant

18
00:00:40,329 --> 00:00:45,489
wound down the board of directors for

19
00:00:42,579 --> 00:00:47,439
that grant program which included Ag and

20
00:00:45,488 --> 00:00:48,849
markets Farm Bureau the largest

21
00:00:47,439 --> 00:00:51,939
agricultural commodities in the state

22
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:54,819
CEO said can we create something that

23
00:00:51,939 --> 00:00:57,189
will outlive this initial grant from

24
00:00:54,819 --> 00:00:59,799
USDA and they came up with the idea of a

25
00:00:57,189 --> 00:01:03,280
farmer farmer directed organization

26
00:00:59,798 --> 00:01:05,620
nonprofit that would provide guidance

27
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,478
for applying cultural research and

28
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:10,149
education programs for agriculture

29
00:01:07,478 --> 00:01:12,039
across the state of New York and so they

30
00:01:10,149 --> 00:01:16,118
took the I the idea to the list the

31
00:01:12,039 --> 00:01:18,939
state legislature and they liked it and

32
00:01:16,118 --> 00:01:21,728
funded it and in 2005 we were we

33
00:01:18,938 --> 00:01:27,658
received our first shot of funding and

34
00:01:21,728 --> 00:01:30,430
first started funding projects see you

35
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:37,299
get started heading off in directions

36
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:37,868
and on the wrong way there we go wrong

37
00:01:37,299 --> 00:01:41,289
direction

38
00:01:37,868 --> 00:01:45,608
yes so we're in 2005 we started our

39
00:01:41,289 --> 00:01:47,560
first projects we have a 10 member Board

40
00:01:45,608 --> 00:01:50,798
of Directors better all farmers and

41
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:53,140
volunteer on our board we fund a plan

42
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:55,210
egg cultural research education and

43
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:56,709
business development projects across all

44
00:01:55,209 --> 00:01:58,718
agricultural commodities in New York

45
00:01:56,709 --> 00:02:00,788
State that across all areas of the state

46
00:01:58,718 --> 00:02:04,509
we utilize an outcome-based funding

47
00:02:00,789 --> 00:02:07,210
model we the board wants to know what

48
00:02:04,509 --> 00:02:09,520
will be measurably different at the farm

49
00:02:07,209 --> 00:02:12,819
level as a result of funding this

50
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:16,390
project and all of our projects are

51
00:02:12,819 --> 00:02:19,780
reviewed by farmer review panels we have

52
00:02:16,389 --> 00:02:23,169
17 review panels that look at different

53
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:26,140
cultural areas and we activate those

54
00:02:23,169 --> 00:02:29,530
panels based on the applications that we

55
00:02:26,139 --> 00:02:33,250
receive in any particular grant year 17

56
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:36,430
review panels and we engaged over 100

57
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:39,129
dairy farm well and over 100 farmers on

58
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:40,870
those review panels and in this past

59
00:02:39,129 --> 00:02:43,090
year we've also added Agri service

60
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:44,950
professionals to those panels as well

61
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:46,479
we're always we're trying to recruit

62
00:02:44,949 --> 00:02:48,189
people so if anywhere it's interested in

63
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:50,049
the grant reviewer for prime value

64
00:02:48,189 --> 00:02:51,009
bility projects let me know we can put

65
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:54,160
you put you to work

66
00:02:51,009 --> 00:02:57,340
in January and February reviewing

67
00:02:54,159 --> 00:03:01,599
proposals so in terms of soil health

68
00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:03,789
projects we funded soil health projects

69
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:06,669
in the very first year of our existence

70
00:03:03,789 --> 00:03:09,579
in 2005 we funded two projects they were

71
00:03:06,669 --> 00:03:12,549
soil health oriented and since that time

72
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:14,740
we've funded 41 soil health related

73
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:18,189
projects or projects that contain soil

74
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:20,260
health components and across nine

75
00:03:18,189 --> 00:03:23,169
different organizations they used

76
00:03:20,259 --> 00:03:25,030
utilize our funding some of those

77
00:03:23,169 --> 00:03:27,250
organizations certainly include Cornell

78
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:30,000
we as Dave mentioned earlier we have

79
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:34,360
some of the funding for the soil health

80
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:36,759
soil test and getting it utilized more

81
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:40,540
widely across the state we provided some

82
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:43,389
funding to they've mentioned Elsa

83
00:03:40,539 --> 00:03:45,849
shields and the nematode work we've

84
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:47,109
provided funding Kanellis to Ellison

85
00:03:45,849 --> 00:03:49,180
over the years for that

86
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:50,800
provide funding to nofa New York for

87
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:53,439
some of the soil health workshop their

88
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:55,480
work that they have done and and also a

89
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:57,250
project that we funded with American

90
00:03:55,479 --> 00:04:00,129
Farmland trust a couple of years ago

91
00:03:57,250 --> 00:04:02,979
looking at interceding in corn so a

92
00:04:00,129 --> 00:04:05,409
number of projects over those 41

93
00:04:02,979 --> 00:04:07,799
projects we invested over three point

94
00:04:05,409 --> 00:04:12,099
six million dollars in soil health

95
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:13,270
related projects since 2005 so I'm not

96
00:04:12,099 --> 00:04:15,250
insignificant

97
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:18,040
in the areas that we've looked at in

98
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:20,170
terms of soil projects with fund

99
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:22,900
projects in grain production forage

100
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:27,430
production viticulture vegetables some

101
00:04:22,899 --> 00:04:29,949
of our news work in minimum till and

102
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:31,870
vegetables no-till vegetables high

103
00:04:29,949 --> 00:04:34,750
tunnel soil management and manure

104
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:38,590
management projects um it's a name a few

105
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:43,500
there in terms of what we've done now so

106
00:04:38,589 --> 00:04:43,500
in 2018 and going forward

107
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:47,210
2018

108
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:53,180
we had a kind of a special emphasis on

109
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:56,089
soil health we wanted to get project

110
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:58,370
leaders whose projects that didn't

111
00:04:56,089 --> 00:05:00,500
really falling in line as a soil health

112
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:03,259
project but might have soil health

113
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:05,360
implications for example we funded a lot

114
00:05:03,259 --> 00:05:07,550
of vegetable production work in flower

115
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:09,439
production work in high tunnels nobody

116
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:11,270
thought of us early and all the sudden

117
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:13,730
boom we have soil health problems and

118
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:15,439
issues in high tunnels so now we need to

119
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:18,439
resolve those issues nobody thought

120
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:21,439
about that with finding project funding

121
00:05:18,439 --> 00:05:23,360
two researchers who are applying various

122
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:25,969
chemicals and additives in soil to

123
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,319
control insects or diseases but not were

124
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:29,270
you thinking necessarily about the

125
00:05:27,319 --> 00:05:30,290
impact on soil health so we're going to

126
00:05:29,269 --> 00:05:33,680
try and get people to start thinking

127
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:37,010
about how their projects might be

128
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:38,840
related to soil health in 2019 we're

129
00:05:37,009 --> 00:05:42,050
gonna maintain a focus on soil health

130
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:44,689
and also encourage projects to be

131
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:46,220
submitted in the soil health arena those

132
00:05:44,689 --> 00:05:47,810
projects have sought to be good quality

133
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:49,940
projects they will not receive any

134
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:51,110
preferential treatment they still have

135
00:05:49,939 --> 00:05:57,889
to compete with all of our other

136
00:05:51,110 --> 00:06:01,490
projects going going forward so I heard

137
00:05:57,889 --> 00:06:04,189
bill so one thing I will say in closing

138
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:05,720
here is know that that part of my

139
00:06:04,189 --> 00:06:07,939
ability Institute and our board is

140
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:11,630
committed to soil health long term and

141
00:06:07,939 --> 00:06:14,689
in sort of staying in the game and we're

142
00:06:11,629 --> 00:06:17,719
looking forward to the development of

143
00:06:14,689 --> 00:06:20,300
the soil health roadmap that will be

144
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:22,280
talked about later today and I think the

145
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:24,980
guidance that that document will

146
00:06:22,279 --> 00:06:28,129
hopefully provide to universities to

147
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:31,400
extension associations to swim water

148
00:06:28,129 --> 00:06:34,699
conservation districts to agencies to

149
00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:38,299
NGOs like American Farmland trust and

150
00:06:34,699 --> 00:06:40,939
others and help to consolidate and

151
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:43,100
coordinate the work that's done in the

152
00:06:40,939 --> 00:06:45,529
soil health arena and farm viability is

153
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:47,000
looking forward to funding those kinds

154
00:06:45,529 --> 00:06:49,939
of activities across all those

155
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:52,220
organizations in the future so thank you

156
00:06:49,939 --> 00:06:55,480
very much and I'll turn it over to Jeff

157
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:55,480
take us to lunch

158
00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:06,870
this has been a production of Cornell

159
