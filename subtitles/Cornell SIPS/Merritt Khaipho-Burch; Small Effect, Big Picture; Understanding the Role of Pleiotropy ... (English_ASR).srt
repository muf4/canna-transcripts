1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:04,759
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:05,679 --> 00:00:11,039
University I'm going to start us off

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:12,679
with talking a little bit about myself

4
00:00:11,039 --> 00:00:15,838
and where I come from and the people

5
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:17,480
that I come from um so I grew up in a

6
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:20,278
trailer at the edge of the Tanto

7
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:22,000
National Forest in New River Arizona um

8
00:00:20,278 --> 00:00:24,518
so think desert Wilderness like down

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,039
here this is my first day of school ever

10
00:00:24,518 --> 00:00:29,518
um I'm an enrolled member of the OA

11
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:31,160
Lakota nation in South Dakota um that's

12
00:00:29,518 --> 00:00:33,119
where my family and I would spend a lot

13
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:35,600
of summers in the house that it's been

14
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:38,039
in my family for over 200 years and on

15
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:41,640
homelands for time in Memorial before

16
00:00:38,039 --> 00:00:44,679
that uh my mom is from bonpo Thailand my

17
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:47,719
mom's sitting over there um it's where

18
00:00:44,679 --> 00:00:50,840
we get the PO part of our names and

19
00:00:47,719 --> 00:00:52,879
uh uh and through a long and winding

20
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:54,280
Journey uh that I won't fully get into

21
00:00:52,878 --> 00:00:55,679
here that was filled with a lot of

22
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:57,640
Adventure a little bit of being

23
00:00:55,679 --> 00:00:59,719
homeschooled and a small stint of being

24
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:01,359
homeless and living in a tent my family

25
00:00:59,719 --> 00:01:03,480
and I I moved to Hawaii and that's where

26
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:05,640
Ed mentioned I got my bachelor's degree

27
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:07,280
at the University of Hawaii at Hilo and

28
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:09,320
after that I moved back to one of my

29
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:12,320
homelands to get my Master's Degree at

30
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:14,279
South Dakota state I'm the first person

31
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:16,158
in my family or my mom's family to have

32
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:17,680
gone to college and the first person in

33
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:19,880
all of my family to get any sort of

34
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,240
graduate degree and I'm not telling you

35
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:23,519
this because I want you to feel sorry

36
00:01:21,239 --> 00:01:26,599
for me or think differently about me or

37
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:28,359
my talk it's just that given my life and

38
00:01:26,599 --> 00:01:30,559
my cultural background I feel like a

39
00:01:28,359 --> 00:01:32,759
statistical anomaly every time I enter

40
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:35,960
academic spaces and especially here at

41
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:39,118
Cornell and so I know I was never meant

42
00:01:35,959 --> 00:01:40,478
to be here um but uh I hope that today I

43
00:01:39,118 --> 00:01:42,159
can tell you a little bit about what

44
00:01:40,478 --> 00:01:46,039
I've been able to do in the past six

45
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:49,600
years and how much this means to um the

46
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:51,479
people and places that I come from so

47
00:01:49,599 --> 00:01:53,879
for the past few years um I have been

48
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:55,840
working on Maze and Maze is a fantastic

49
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:58,839
species to understand the genetic basis

50
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:00,399
of complex traits and so ma is an annual

51
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:01,920
outcrossing

52
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:03,718
species that's deployed with 10

53
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,359
chromosomes and globally it's grown on

54
00:02:03,718 --> 00:02:08,758
around 200 million

55
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:10,919
hectares um and it serves as a fantastic

56
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:12,958
system to study the genetic basis of

57
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:14,958
complex traits uh to learn about Gene

58
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:17,280
regulation and then also validate all of

59
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:20,080
those findings within

60
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:22,439
fields and so my project is uh split

61
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,599
into three different parts the first is

62
00:02:22,439 --> 00:02:26,439
on elucidating the patterns of Pat tropy

63
00:02:24,598 --> 00:02:28,799
the second is on uh the regulatory

64
00:02:26,439 --> 00:02:31,800
impact of tees and the last is on field

65
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:34,480
testing and so for the First on piot

66
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:36,080
tropy um it's helpful to start off with

67
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:38,919
some definitions because p tropy is

68
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:41,040
still really confusing even to me so uh

69
00:02:38,919 --> 00:02:42,839
Pat tropy is a single Locus that can

70
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:44,560
affect multiple different seemingly

71
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:46,239
unrelated traits and there's a lot of

72
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,759
different ways that this Pat tropy can

73
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:51,759
manifest itself the first is with

74
00:02:48,759 --> 00:02:52,959
biological or horizontal pliot tropy um

75
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:54,679
that's where you can have a single

76
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:56,959
causal variant with the star that then

77
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:59,840
impacts two different traits you can

78
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:02,000
have mediated pliot tropy that uh where

79
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:04,560
uh one trait is then causal for

80
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,360
another and then you can have spous Pat

81
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,239
tropy where regions of really strong LD

82
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:10,760
make it hard to distinguish uh what

83
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:13,480
causal variance is leading to what

84
00:03:10,759 --> 00:03:15,919
trait and in maze there are a few

85
00:03:13,479 --> 00:03:18,000
examples of verified Pat tropy and these

86
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:20,559
are things like teent Branch one one of

87
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,439
the major domestication genes uh that

88
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,360
impacts lateral branching inflorescence

89
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:25,878
length and Branch length and there's

90
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:28,599
also one of the major flowering time

91
00:03:25,878 --> 00:03:31,079
genes vgt1 that impacts flowering time

92
00:03:28,598 --> 00:03:34,560
Leaf number and PL

93
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:36,480
tiddes and so looking across larger uh

94
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:39,000
sets of genes and not only domestication

95
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:41,878
or flowering genes the only real pliot

96
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,199
tropy that has able to been or be found

97
00:03:41,878 --> 00:03:46,039
is within a trait sharing the same

98
00:03:44,199 --> 00:03:48,119
developmental unit and so things like

99
00:03:46,039 --> 00:03:50,280
tassel architecture and ear architecture

100
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:51,959
like inflorescence traits there's also

101
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:53,438
some pliot tropy between flowering and

102
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:54,959
leaf traits where you need to have a

103
00:03:53,438 --> 00:03:56,878
certain number of leaves before

104
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:59,719
flowering initiates and then that life

105
00:03:56,878 --> 00:04:01,598
cycle finishes off and there's further

106
00:03:59,719 --> 00:04:03,479
evidence of this with uh sorghum and

107
00:04:01,598 --> 00:04:06,280
Maze where the only Pat tropy that's

108
00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:08,238
really found is in very few Snips um and

109
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:10,680
they are typically between again things

110
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:12,878
that are sharing the same developmental

111
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:14,840
unit um within a lot of the human

112
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:16,959
genetic studies they've been able to

113
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:18,720
look at things like how pliot tropy is

114
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:20,160
more associated with more highly

115
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,680
expressed genes that are expressed

116
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,880
across more tissues along with DNA

117
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:26,560
accessibility and DNA conservation but

118
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:30,279
in maze a lot of these things are

119
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:32,439
largely unknown and so in this project

120
00:04:30,279 --> 00:04:35,239
uh there two main questions were what

121
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:37,319
are the actual patterns of pliot tropy

122
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:39,240
do um they kind of mimic some of these

123
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:42,319
large effect domestication or flowering

124
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:43,879
time Loi or uh are they different in

125
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:46,360
large standing natural variation

126
00:04:43,879 --> 00:04:48,240
populations and the second is can pliot

127
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:50,038
tropy be modeled and if so what kind of

128
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:52,759
biological and noise terms actually

129
00:04:50,038 --> 00:04:55,159
explain the amount of Pat tropy

130
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:56,639
present and so in order to do this we

131
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:58,960
collected every single published

132
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:01,439
phenotype within the ma n and 282

133
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:03,599
populations and this came out to be over

134
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:05,918
120,000 different traits and they were

135
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:08,520
for things like RNA expression values

136
00:05:05,918 --> 00:05:10,079
across different tissues metabolite data

137
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:12,639
and also field traits so like the

138
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:15,240
traditional plant height uh kernel row

139
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:17,918
number and inflorescence

140
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:20,918
architecture and so with these traits we

141
00:05:17,918 --> 00:05:22,758
perform gwas using rassel and then for

142
00:05:20,918 --> 00:05:24,918
our pliot tropy metric we counted the

143
00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:27,319
number of unique traits mapping to each

144
00:05:24,918 --> 00:05:29,159
interval and so what this look like for

145
00:05:27,319 --> 00:05:30,960
Interval a for example there's two

146
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:33,360
shapes that map to it and so it's two

147
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:35,680
unique traits uh for Interval B it would

148
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:37,759
just be one C is our least fotopic

149
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,478
interval so it's zero and then e is our

150
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:42,319
most pliot Tropic interval with three

151
00:05:39,478 --> 00:05:44,159
unique traits mapping to it um in order

152
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:46,039
to get a kind of null Baseline of what

153
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,880
no pliot tropy would look like we

154
00:05:46,038 --> 00:05:50,839
permuted our traits anywhere from five

155
00:05:47,879 --> 00:05:53,159
to 10 times ran gwas again and then got

156
00:05:50,839 --> 00:05:54,279
our null counts of what no pliot tropy

157
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:56,439
looked

158
00:05:54,279 --> 00:05:58,478
like and so for all the plots that I'm

159
00:05:56,439 --> 00:06:00,038
going to show you all the types of fot

160
00:05:58,478 --> 00:06:01,918
tropy are mixed up we didn't try to

161
00:06:00,038 --> 00:06:05,959
distinguish between any one of these and

162
00:06:01,918 --> 00:06:08,598
so it's just a a mixed bag of

163
00:06:05,959 --> 00:06:10,918
everything

164
00:06:08,598 --> 00:06:14,240
uh realized I could turn the captions

165
00:06:10,918 --> 00:06:16,359
off okay uh so to Prime you for the plot

166
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:18,639
that I'm going to show you um this shows

167
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:21,038
on the xaxis the log number observed

168
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:23,120
over fudu traits and the y- AIS is the

169
00:06:21,038 --> 00:06:25,079
number of intervals and the main thing

170
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:27,478
is is that anything that falls along the

171
00:06:25,079 --> 00:06:30,560
dashed line means that there's oh no

172
00:06:27,478 --> 00:06:32,439
pliot tropy um anything to the left of

173
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,759
the dash line means that there's noise

174
00:06:32,439 --> 00:06:36,439
and anything to the right means there's

175
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:38,720
sum and so for the N Field traits around

176
00:06:36,439 --> 00:06:41,680
1% of intervals actually show evidence

177
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:42,800
for Pat tropy and it controls around

178
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:46,000
five different

179
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:48,079
traits um looking across all the other

180
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,918
populations and trait types um this

181
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:53,598
number varies from 1 to 32% of intervals

182
00:06:50,918 --> 00:06:55,799
controlling anywhere from 5 to 400

183
00:06:53,598 --> 00:06:57,839
traits and even though this seems like a

184
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:59,960
lot in later slides I'll show you that

185
00:06:57,839 --> 00:07:02,758
this is primarily due to noise terms imp

186
00:06:59,959 --> 00:07:05,318
parted through the gwos

187
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:08,400
process and so now that we know that

188
00:07:05,319 --> 00:07:10,520
there is variability in plot tropy um we

189
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:12,000
kind of we we bring back a lot of the

190
00:07:10,519 --> 00:07:14,000
terms that have been important within

191
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,639
the human genetics models like gene

192
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,598
expression uh DNA accessibility DNA

193
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:20,519
conservation and some noise terms that

194
00:07:18,598 --> 00:07:22,399
are imparted through gws like uh the

195
00:07:20,519 --> 00:07:24,399
mean amount of LD within the interval

196
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:26,079
we're looking at the size of the

197
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:28,318
interval and then also the number of

198
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:30,038
input gws Snips that we

199
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:32,080
used

200
00:07:30,038 --> 00:07:33,680
um and we put all these things together

201
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:35,279
and build a random forest model to

202
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:37,560
determine what are the most important

203
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:41,439
variables in explaining fot

204
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:43,240
tropy and this shows that um primarily

205
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:45,240
statistical noise terms in part of the

206
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:47,079
Gs are the most important and so again

207
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:48,960
these are things like Snips for Interval

208
00:07:47,079 --> 00:07:51,478
the physical size and the average amount

209
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:52,959
of LD of much lower biological

210
00:07:51,478 --> 00:07:55,918
importance are things like sequence

211
00:07:52,959 --> 00:07:58,478
conservation RNA expression or um

212
00:07:55,918 --> 00:08:00,318
protein expression and a very similar

213
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:01,959
trend is shown across all the other

214
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:04,199
populations and trait types that we

215
00:08:01,959 --> 00:08:07,519
looked

216
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:09,720
at and so altogether um LD and noise

217
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:12,719
terms explain Pat tropy much better than

218
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:14,879
any other biological feature or term and

219
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:17,199
we hypothesize that most descriptions of

220
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:19,280
plyopic genes in the past are probably

221
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:21,199
really confounded by linkage because

222
00:08:19,279 --> 00:08:22,799
it's it's a hard thing to break out of

223
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:25,400
and there's a lot of

224
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:28,960
it and so the key takeaways from this

225
00:08:25,399 --> 00:08:31,000
project um were Pat tropy are or is is

226
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:33,838
not as common as we previously thought

227
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,799
and the 1 to 32% of plyopic intervals

228
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:38,120
that we found can originate from sites

229
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:41,038
with varying chromatin accessibility

230
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:43,639
expression and conservation levels most

231
00:08:41,038 --> 00:08:45,919
observed petrop is noise and so LD will

232
00:08:43,639 --> 00:08:49,120
really mess up any uh Pat tropy

233
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:51,240
estimates that we get and last Pat tropy

234
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:53,480
in crop plants is highly constrained by

235
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:55,120
Evolution and so the load of modest

236
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:57,000
level Supply tropy actually kind of

237
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,919
makes sense because it would allow for

238
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,399
selection to more easily fine-tune and

239
00:08:58,919 --> 00:09:02,679
adap ADT varieties to different

240
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:04,679
locations and I like to think about if

241
00:09:02,679 --> 00:09:06,120
you had a single Gene that controlled 50

242
00:09:04,679 --> 00:09:07,919
different traits it's much harder to

243
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:11,679
work with that single Gene as opposed to

244
00:09:07,919 --> 00:09:14,319
50 genes controlling 50 different

245
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:16,838
traits and so even though Pat tropy

246
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:18,879
might have had little genome wide impact

247
00:09:16,839 --> 00:09:20,800
the the impact of trait curation and the

248
00:09:18,879 --> 00:09:22,759
gwas results themselves had a really

249
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:24,799
large impact and I've been lucky to be a

250
00:09:22,759 --> 00:09:26,919
part of numerous different papers that

251
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:29,240
have used these traits and phenotypes to

252
00:09:26,919 --> 00:09:30,719
predict traits with RNA expression

253
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:32,320
values or look at how they can be

254
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:36,959
explained by conserved non-coding

255
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:36,959
regions Upstream of jees so that was

256
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:45,919
good the next project that I worked on

257
00:09:43,078 --> 00:09:48,719
um was looking at the impact of tees on

258
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:51,519
gene expression and so a study I was a

259
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:54,320
major contributor to in 2021 showed that

260
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:56,240
around 34% of the expression variation

261
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:58,120
in genes can be explained by CIS

262
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,919
regulatory variants and these are

263
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:01,879
variants that occur within in genes or

264
00:09:59,919 --> 00:10:03,919
right next to genes and one of the

265
00:10:01,879 --> 00:10:06,200
long-standing questions has been how

266
00:10:03,919 --> 00:10:07,879
much do transposable elements or tees

267
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:09,640
themselves contribute to this gene

268
00:10:07,879 --> 00:10:13,120
expression

269
00:10:09,639 --> 00:10:15,600
variation um I really oh yeah and it

270
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:17,799
kind of makes sense in maze because 85%

271
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:20,360
of the genome is made up of transposable

272
00:10:17,799 --> 00:10:22,319
elements or these repetitive sequences

273
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:24,278
and a famous example of this is the

274
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,959
bronze one Locus and Maze where the

275
00:10:24,278 --> 00:10:28,679
different rows correspond to different

276
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:31,719
maze inbred lines and the yellow bars um

277
00:10:28,679 --> 00:10:35,000
are transposons and the orange or the

278
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:36,360
red triangles are DNA transposons and

279
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,120
you can see that the ma genome is

280
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:40,240
absolutely littered with transposable

281
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:43,440
elements throughout its inner genic

282
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:46,680
space in terms of tees that contribute

283
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:48,920
to gene expression uh tiente Branch one

284
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:51,159
is another really famous example where a

285
00:10:48,919 --> 00:10:52,958
hopscotch retrotransposon brings in an

286
00:10:51,159 --> 00:10:55,199
enhancer that then increases gene

287
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:56,679
expression by around two times and this

288
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:59,839
leads to the differences in plant

289
00:10:56,679 --> 00:11:02,838
architecture between tiente and Maze

290
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:05,240
um and bringing in an enhancer is just

291
00:11:02,839 --> 00:11:07,240
one way in which a te can potentially

292
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:08,839
impact gene expression uh you can

293
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:10,519
imagine with the bronze one example you

294
00:11:08,839 --> 00:11:12,440
could get a te that inserts into an

295
00:11:10,519 --> 00:11:14,799
Exxon and leads to a loss of function of

296
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:16,760
the gene entirely or it could be even

297
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:18,479
more complicated than that and the te

298
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:21,480
could introduce methylation to the

299
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:24,000
surrounding region and silence the gene

300
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:26,800
entirely and so for a large complex

301
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,600
trait like yields um tees have been

302
00:11:26,799 --> 00:11:30,719
shown to impart really subtle effects on

303
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:33,040
Fitness and this was another study I was

304
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:34,560
a part of that's now on bioarchive that

305
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:38,240
showed that individuals who had more

306
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:41,319
tees had um uh uh showed lower grain

307
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:43,480
yield in the ma namam hybrids and making

308
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:45,240
a number of assumptions on per plant

309
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:47,639
yields and planting density and the

310
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:50,600
number of kernels per year this came out

311
00:11:47,639 --> 00:11:53,000
to losing around one to eight kernels

312
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:55,600
per additional 14 megabases

313
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:58,159
at and the question kind of Still

314
00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:00,240
Remains though um if these same small

315
00:11:58,159 --> 00:12:03,799
effects occur for smaller molecular

316
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:05,959
phenotypes like gene expression um like

317
00:12:03,799 --> 00:12:08,399
they do for

318
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:10,679
yields so the key questions for this

319
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:12,320
project were do tees impact gene

320
00:12:10,679 --> 00:12:14,599
expression within the Maze imds and

321
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:17,680
hybrids and if so at what distances do

322
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:19,519
these effects occur at uh what te

323
00:12:17,679 --> 00:12:21,919
families cause the largest effects and

324
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:24,600
if so are there any known patterns among

325
00:12:21,919 --> 00:12:26,360
those families and last how much

326
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:28,360
expression variance do these tees

327
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:30,879
actually explain and do they mimic some

328
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:33,278
of the large domestication loai or um

329
00:12:30,879 --> 00:12:36,278
are they more subtle like

330
00:12:33,278 --> 00:12:38,559
yields and so to do this uh we use the

331
00:12:36,278 --> 00:12:41,078
high quality ma n genome sequences that

332
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:44,719
were releas released a few years ago um

333
00:12:41,078 --> 00:12:47,679
and we also collected around 372 RNA

334
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:50,040
samples uh from both the ma inbred

335
00:12:47,679 --> 00:12:53,120
founder parents and then also hybrids

336
00:12:50,039 --> 00:12:55,159
between b73 and two other testers we

337
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:57,240
collected RNA samples from across four

338
00:12:55,159 --> 00:12:59,319
different tissues and Quantified our

339
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:01,600
expression counts with salmon and then

340
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:03,278
for our te annotations we used the ones

341
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:05,360
that were generated as part of the N

342
00:13:03,278 --> 00:13:08,720
Genome Project and so they were the

343
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,720
Eda te

344
00:13:08,919 --> 00:13:14,198
annotations and so to actually model the

345
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:16,839
effect of tees on expression we chose to

346
00:13:14,198 --> 00:13:19,078
calculate the number of te base pairs in

347
00:13:16,839 --> 00:13:21,839
non-overlapping window of Windows

348
00:13:19,078 --> 00:13:23,879
Upstream of each gene um and so for this

349
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:25,959
example even though it looks weird the

350
00:13:23,879 --> 00:13:27,679
gene transcribes over to the left I know

351
00:13:25,958 --> 00:13:29,198
it looks funny but I'll explain the

352
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:33,919
other parts of the model and hopefully

353
00:13:29,198 --> 00:13:37,000
makes sense um so here we go oh no that

354
00:13:33,919 --> 00:13:39,159
really SPS okay so um we know that

355
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,720
there's tees Upstream of each gene and

356
00:13:39,159 --> 00:13:43,240
we also know that there are uh or DNA

357
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:44,839
methylation plays a large role in

358
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:46,720
whether or not genes are expressed and

359
00:13:44,839 --> 00:13:48,920
we know that unmethylated genes tend to

360
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:52,320
be expressed and so we layer on

361
00:13:48,919 --> 00:13:55,278
unmethylated regions on top

362
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:57,120
um and then we go window by window and

363
00:13:55,278 --> 00:13:58,799
count the number of te base pairs

364
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,759
occurring within that window and the

365
00:13:58,799 --> 00:14:02,758
number of unmethylated regions also

366
00:14:00,759 --> 00:14:05,639
occurring in that window and we do that

367
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:08,360
for every window Upstream up to 15 KB

368
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:10,039
away from genes and then we do that for

369
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:10,720
all the other genes that are present in

370
00:14:10,039 --> 00:14:13,039
the

371
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:14,759
genome and so we take all of those model

372
00:14:13,039 --> 00:14:16,799
components and then we build a model

373
00:14:14,759 --> 00:14:19,759
that actually asks what is the effect of

374
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:22,799
expression um uh with te base pairs in

375
00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:25,919
the number of unmethylated

376
00:14:22,799 --> 00:14:29,319
regions and so this plot is showing the

377
00:14:25,919 --> 00:14:31,439
uh Gene there we go oh no it's not

378
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:33,040
showing okay it's showing the gene that

379
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:35,199
again transcribes to the left and

380
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:38,198
multiple distances going away from that

381
00:14:35,198 --> 00:14:41,039
Gene and uh the yellow line shows the

382
00:14:38,198 --> 00:14:43,000
count of unmethylated regions um and the

383
00:14:41,039 --> 00:14:44,919
effect estimate on the y- axis from the

384
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:50,120
model and we can see near the core

385
00:14:44,919 --> 00:14:52,919
promoter of genes te um or sorry

386
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:54,600
um yeah near the core promoter

387
00:14:52,919 --> 00:14:56,240
unmethylated regions are really

388
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:59,399
important and that makes sense because

389
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:01,519
unmethylated genes tend to be expressed

390
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:04,399
in terms of tees we find a weekly

391
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:05,879
negative effect of tees uh te base pairs

392
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:08,360
when they insert within the core

393
00:15:05,879 --> 00:15:10,838
promoter along with another more weakly

394
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:14,159
negative effect uh near the actual

395
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:17,759
promoter of genes and this kind of

396
00:15:14,159 --> 00:15:19,879
suggests that um there uh tees are

397
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:22,199
imparting subtle negative effects when

398
00:15:19,879 --> 00:15:23,639
they insert into core regulatory regions

399
00:15:22,198 --> 00:15:25,359
and that makes sense because they might

400
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:27,799
be potentially

401
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:29,680
deleterious one of the main problems

402
00:15:27,799 --> 00:15:32,599
though with this model is that it's

403
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:34,278
looking across all te families and all

404
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:36,040
of these families differ really greatly

405
00:15:34,278 --> 00:15:38,759
by their insertion preferences their

406
00:15:36,039 --> 00:15:41,679
actual sequence content and the also

407
00:15:38,759 --> 00:15:44,039
physical size of the te

408
00:15:41,679 --> 00:15:46,239
itself and so this is an example just

409
00:15:44,039 --> 00:15:48,919
looking at the differences of te length

410
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:50,959
on the Y AIS between DNA transposons and

411
00:15:48,919 --> 00:15:52,958
retrotransposons and Maze and

412
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:56,799
retrotransposons or Retros tend to be

413
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:59,278
much larger in general than DNA

414
00:15:56,799 --> 00:16:01,919
tees kind of looking at this plot in a

415
00:15:59,278 --> 00:16:04,078
different way in my data um this plot is

416
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:06,039
looking at the proportion of te families

417
00:16:04,078 --> 00:16:08,879
that fall into four different size

418
00:16:06,039 --> 00:16:11,318
categories uh based on their cumulative

419
00:16:08,879 --> 00:16:13,879
abundance across Nam and so for very

420
00:16:11,318 --> 00:16:16,599
large te families the ones on the bottom

421
00:16:13,879 --> 00:16:19,439
there's only 48 of them in my data set

422
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:22,600
that make up um you know that are over a

423
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:25,959
100 megabases in n and they actually

424
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:27,759
make up like 50% of the N genome but

425
00:16:25,958 --> 00:16:30,039
there are there's an overwhelming

426
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:31,839
majority of really small te families out

427
00:16:30,039 --> 00:16:33,399
there that still could potentially cause

428
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:35,839
effects even though they don't

429
00:16:33,399 --> 00:16:38,000
contribute a lot of total base

430
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:40,120
pairs and so in order to see if there

431
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,039
was an effect between smaller tees and

432
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:43,879
really large tees I grouped them into

433
00:16:42,039 --> 00:16:46,240
these four different size categories and

434
00:16:43,879 --> 00:16:48,639
ran the same model as before seeing if

435
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:51,120
there's an impact of gene expression um

436
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:52,759
and te base pairs given in each one of

437
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:55,159
these small

438
00:16:52,759 --> 00:16:58,919
families and so this is just looking at

439
00:16:55,159 --> 00:17:00,879
one DNA transposon in the top 5% of te

440
00:16:58,919 --> 00:17:04,759
families causing the largest effects on

441
00:17:00,879 --> 00:17:08,119
gene expression and this is a DNA te a

442
00:17:04,759 --> 00:17:10,480
helon um and so we can see a long

443
00:17:08,119 --> 00:17:12,918
distance there's a variable effect of

444
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:14,679
this one te family a long distance and

445
00:17:12,919 --> 00:17:16,759
if we look at the other small families

446
00:17:14,679 --> 00:17:19,519
they tend to cause the largest overall

447
00:17:16,759 --> 00:17:21,439
absolute effects on expression versus

448
00:17:19,519 --> 00:17:24,959
much larger families which are in all of

449
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:28,079
the different colors here and so overall

450
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:30,160
yes we do see an effect uh with te size

451
00:17:28,078 --> 00:17:32,000
and we also see an effect by distance

452
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:33,600
and so we're still looking into what a

453
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,480
lot of this means and whether or not

454
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:38,279
it's just highlighting um like the te

455
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,839
family insertion preference into these

456
00:17:38,279 --> 00:17:42,599
different regions or if it's actually

457
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:42,599
something more

458
00:17:43,319 --> 00:17:48,038
biological and so all of our past models

459
00:17:46,519 --> 00:17:50,720
have shown that distance is really

460
00:17:48,038 --> 00:17:52,960
important in determining if a te has an

461
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:55,200
effect or not and so we wanted to run a

462
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:57,679
more simplified model just with distance

463
00:17:55,200 --> 00:18:00,080
to see what that effect was and so we

464
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:02,320
took the number of Bas pairs until the

465
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:04,439
first insertion from a particular family

466
00:18:02,319 --> 00:18:07,200
and so this one would be the first mint

467
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:09,600
te the first blue te family and the

468
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:11,960
first orange one and then we do this for

469
00:18:09,599 --> 00:18:13,639
all the other te families and first

470
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:15,759
insertions of that

471
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:17,600
family and so this is what our model

472
00:18:15,759 --> 00:18:19,200
looked like we just took expression

473
00:18:17,599 --> 00:18:21,038
against distance for each family

474
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:23,319
separately and did the same model for

475
00:18:21,038 --> 00:18:25,960
each family

476
00:18:23,319 --> 00:18:28,839
separately and this plot is looking at

477
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:31,440
the median distance to that family

478
00:18:28,839 --> 00:18:33,678
by the uh partial adjusted r squar on

479
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:36,000
the y- axis of how much variation it

480
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:38,720
actually explains in expression and

481
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:41,960
around one KB away from genes tends to

482
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:44,839
have the largest effects on expression

483
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:48,600
um and uh I should also explain that the

484
00:18:44,839 --> 00:18:52,199
color of the points uh sorry my bad uh

485
00:18:48,599 --> 00:18:54,399
refers to the number of genes that uh te

486
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:57,679
was present near and so the largest

487
00:18:54,400 --> 00:19:00,600
effect tees tend to be present in very

488
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:02,559
few genes overall tees that are present

489
00:19:00,599 --> 00:19:06,719
in more than a thousand genes don't tend

490
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:06,720
to cause any uh large effects

491
00:19:07,599 --> 00:19:12,038
whatsoever and so the top five families

492
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:14,519
that contribute to these effects tend to

493
00:19:12,038 --> 00:19:17,200
be things like helitrons and other DNA

494
00:19:14,519 --> 00:19:19,079
tees along with one LTR

495
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:21,480
retrotransposon um and a lot of the

496
00:19:19,079 --> 00:19:23,158
future work in the next coming months is

497
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:25,480
going to be towards validating some of

498
00:19:23,159 --> 00:19:27,280
these effects and and trying to

499
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:30,079
determine if there's any patterns in the

500
00:19:27,279 --> 00:19:32,440
genes that they insert

501
00:19:30,079 --> 00:19:34,558
here so the key takeaways from this

502
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:37,240
project um tees and known regulatory

503
00:19:34,558 --> 00:19:38,879
regions decrease gene expression um and

504
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:41,480
they tend to be near the core promoter

505
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:43,720
or actual promoter of the Gene and these

506
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:45,679
are known regions already that are

507
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:47,159
enriched for open chromatin or TF

508
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:48,880
binding sites so it makes sense that

509
00:19:47,159 --> 00:19:52,520
tees would impart more of a negative

510
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:54,440
effect there um next is that small te

511
00:19:52,519 --> 00:19:58,440
families tend to have the largest

512
00:19:54,440 --> 00:20:00,679
effects and uh last is yeah te families

513
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:02,400
only explain explain a fraction of the

514
00:20:00,679 --> 00:20:04,840
variance in the cyst regulatory

515
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:08,200
expression in the small subset of genes

516
00:20:04,839 --> 00:20:10,519
that they actually insert near and this

517
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:12,679
suggests that the ma Geno might uh be

518
00:20:10,519 --> 00:20:15,599
using selection to restrict large effect

519
00:20:12,679 --> 00:20:17,919
te insertions and in favor of more small

520
00:20:15,599 --> 00:20:17,918
effect

521
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:27,000
ones and so most of my work until this

522
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:29,159
point has shown that quantitative traits

523
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,880
are highly polygenic and that any

524
00:20:29,159 --> 00:20:33,520
candidate Loi that we find will have

525
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:35,960
incredibly small effects and a lot of

526
00:20:33,519 --> 00:20:38,960
this is dictated by uh Alan or's work

527
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:42,440
and along with Fisher's geometric model

528
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:45,400
um that uh that says as a a population

529
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:48,440
gets closer to its Fitness Optimum um

530
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:50,480
such as maze um the the smaller and fall

531
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:52,159
smaller those effects will actually be

532
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:54,038
and this makes sense because ma is

533
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:56,000
undergone domestication already and so

534
00:20:54,038 --> 00:20:58,798
any trait that we're looking at now will

535
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:01,038
have really small effects overall

536
00:20:58,798 --> 00:21:02,798
um and so for yields the most complex

537
00:21:01,038 --> 00:21:04,679
and quantitative of all traits we

538
00:21:02,798 --> 00:21:07,400
wouldn't expect anything

539
00:21:04,679 --> 00:21:09,679
different and this Segways into my last

540
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:12,240
project on yield testing that was

541
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:16,038
published in nature last

542
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:17,599
year so this is sparked by um a lot of

543
00:21:16,038 --> 00:21:20,400
papers that have been published over the

544
00:21:17,599 --> 00:21:22,319
last 20 years that say um that they can

545
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:25,519
increase yields by anywhere from 8 to

546
00:21:22,319 --> 00:21:27,079
68% through a single Gene but one of the

547
00:21:25,519 --> 00:21:30,079
main problems is that these results

548
00:21:27,079 --> 00:21:33,480
never translate into to uh real yield

549
00:21:30,079 --> 00:21:35,678
gains on farm and after reading a lot of

550
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:38,440
these papers and running a structured

551
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:40,798
review of them I found that they have a

552
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:42,759
lot of common problems among them and

553
00:21:40,798 --> 00:21:44,639
these problems are things like a

554
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:46,519
misunderstanding of what yield actually

555
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:49,559
is and how yield components contribute

556
00:21:46,519 --> 00:21:51,480
to that um this also has to do a lot

557
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:52,480
with measuring single plant yield versus

558
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:55,440
plot

559
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:56,919
yields uh next is not matching on Farm

560
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:59,400
conditions so a lot of folks are not

561
00:21:56,919 --> 00:22:01,720
testing an elite germ plasm and having

562
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:04,278
confounding um Edge and density effects

563
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:06,480
that lead to misleading yield estimates

564
00:22:04,278 --> 00:22:08,200
there's also uh questions of scale with

565
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:09,960
hand harvesting versus mechanically

566
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:12,400
harvesting these

567
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:14,600
experiments there's also insufficient

568
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:16,840
environmental and plot replication and

569
00:22:14,599 --> 00:22:19,678
so there's a good number of greenhouse

570
00:22:16,839 --> 00:22:21,199
onlys and this typically isn't a problem

571
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:23,000
if you're trying to do like a proof of

572
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:25,080
concept experiment but when you're

573
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,599
saying you know four plants grown in a

574
00:22:25,079 --> 00:22:28,918
greenhouse are going to change the face

575
00:22:26,599 --> 00:22:33,558
of Agriculture forever it starts to

576
00:22:28,919 --> 00:22:35,200
become a problem so yeah um there's also

577
00:22:33,558 --> 00:22:36,960
very little plot or environment

578
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:41,120
replication and testing for yield

579
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:43,038
effects in only a sing year um there's

580
00:22:41,119 --> 00:22:44,678
also a lot of testing genes that might

581
00:22:43,038 --> 00:22:47,038
have already been fixed within breeding

582
00:22:44,679 --> 00:22:50,080
programs and also

583
00:22:47,038 --> 00:22:51,158
um looking at yield effects in leals

584
00:22:50,079 --> 00:22:53,399
that have been segregating within

585
00:22:51,159 --> 00:22:55,520
breeding populations for the past few

586
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:57,159
decades and often when you read really

587
00:22:55,519 --> 00:22:58,639
closely within these papers you find

588
00:22:57,159 --> 00:23:01,080
that there are a lot of trade-offs with

589
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:03,559
other yield components um in those

590
00:23:01,079 --> 00:23:05,678
yields so um it's good to think about

591
00:23:03,558 --> 00:23:07,000
when you bring those uh particular yield

592
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:09,159
alals to

593
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:11,079
fixation and the last is lack of

594
00:23:09,159 --> 00:23:13,000
controls and so a lot of folks don't

595
00:23:11,079 --> 00:23:14,639
have empty Vector controls or don't

596
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,480
backcross their varieties into

597
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:18,120
non-transformed varieties or Elite

598
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:20,480
varieties to kind of clean up some of

599
00:23:18,119 --> 00:23:22,879
those background epigenetic effects that

600
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:25,599
can occur during or during the the

601
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:28,360
transformation

602
00:23:25,599 --> 00:23:30,000
process and so I talk about the L two

603
00:23:28,359 --> 00:23:32,319
within my paper and you can read about

604
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:35,880
those there as so I am just going to

605
00:23:32,319 --> 00:23:38,319
dive a little bit deeper into the first

606
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:40,240
three and so for a misunderstanding of

607
00:23:38,319 --> 00:23:42,480
yield and yield components yield is

608
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:44,200
typically the weight of the dry grain or

609
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:47,599
the dry matter content of the storage

610
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:49,558
organs harvested per unit area and so

611
00:23:47,599 --> 00:23:52,000
what a lot of these papers tend to do is

612
00:23:49,558 --> 00:23:53,839
measure differences for example in Grain

613
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,679
length for example between a wild type

614
00:23:53,839 --> 00:23:58,599
and a mutant and say that that increase

615
00:23:56,679 --> 00:24:01,120
in like a quarter of a mill of grain

616
00:23:58,599 --> 00:24:03,439
length is then going to translate into

617
00:24:01,119 --> 00:24:05,399
plot wide yield later on the same goes

618
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:07,720
for changes in Grain length or

619
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:10,480
differences in Grain fill between a wild

620
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:12,679
type and you another one of my favorites

621
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:14,278
is measuring biomass changes in a rabid

622
00:24:12,679 --> 00:24:16,240
opsis and saying that that will then

623
00:24:14,278 --> 00:24:18,159
translate into prop

624
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:22,558
plants and

625
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:25,039
so um it only or 40% or that's a lot of

626
00:24:22,558 --> 00:24:27,319
them uh of the studies in my review uh

627
00:24:25,038 --> 00:24:29,679
measured yields within single plants or

628
00:24:27,319 --> 00:24:31,599
measured y components and pass that off

629
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:34,120
as as their yield

630
00:24:31,599 --> 00:24:36,519
increase one of the main problems with

631
00:24:34,119 --> 00:24:38,359
this though is that increases in

632
00:24:36,519 --> 00:24:41,158
individual yield components or single

633
00:24:38,359 --> 00:24:43,599
plant yields won't necessarily uh scale

634
00:24:41,159 --> 00:24:45,440
especially um the it doesn't imply that

635
00:24:43,599 --> 00:24:47,480
yield per area will

636
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:49,600
increase and this is beautifully

637
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:51,519
exemplified in a lot of Donald duvic's

638
00:24:49,599 --> 00:24:53,798
work looking at the year of hybrid

639
00:24:51,519 --> 00:24:55,720
introduction in the uh Pioneer M

640
00:24:53,798 --> 00:24:58,398
breeding program from starting in the

641
00:24:55,720 --> 00:25:00,440
1930s up to the 2010s

642
00:24:58,398 --> 00:25:03,158
and it shows that when a variety is

643
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:05,038
planted at incredibly low density older

644
00:25:03,159 --> 00:25:07,640
hybrids tend to yield just as much as

645
00:25:05,038 --> 00:25:11,319
newer hybrids however when you increase

646
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:15,038
the density older hybrids are incredibly

647
00:25:11,319 --> 00:25:17,678
outcompeted by newer hybrids in general

648
00:25:15,038 --> 00:25:19,599
and this implies that single plant yield

649
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:22,038
hasn't really changed over time however

650
00:25:19,599 --> 00:25:24,199
the yield per unit area has and that has

651
00:25:22,038 --> 00:25:27,079
been a selection Target in maze breeding

652
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:30,080
programs over the past Century and kind

653
00:25:27,079 --> 00:25:31,839
of scarily only 16% of the studies in my

654
00:25:30,079 --> 00:25:33,678
review actually planted at commercially

655
00:25:31,839 --> 00:25:35,558
relevant densities quite typically

656
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:39,679
they're at incredibly low densities and

657
00:25:35,558 --> 00:25:39,678
that will skew yield estimates in and of

658
00:25:39,759 --> 00:25:44,558
itself up next is insufficient

659
00:25:42,278 --> 00:25:46,558
environment and plot replication and so

660
00:25:44,558 --> 00:25:49,759
this is an example from wheat looking at

661
00:25:46,558 --> 00:25:51,158
the wheat or yield within a plot uh

662
00:25:49,759 --> 00:25:52,759
starting from the center and going out

663
00:25:51,159 --> 00:25:54,399
to the edge and you can see as you go

664
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:56,359
out further to the edge those yield

665
00:25:54,398 --> 00:25:58,079
estimates will increase because those

666
00:25:56,359 --> 00:25:59,959
plants along the edge have more access

667
00:25:58,079 --> 00:26:02,319
to light and nutrients and all those

668
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:04,319
good things and so they'll yield more

669
00:26:02,319 --> 00:26:06,839
typically what folks do is only measure

670
00:26:04,319 --> 00:26:09,278
the stuff on the

671
00:26:06,839 --> 00:26:11,599
inside and something else that can

672
00:26:09,278 --> 00:26:13,919
impact uh just plot yield in general is

673
00:26:11,599 --> 00:26:16,158
competition between plants and so a lot

674
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:18,320
of studies don't tend to actually have

675
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:20,000
border rows or put really competitive

676
00:26:18,319 --> 00:26:22,240
genotypes next to each other and that

677
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,359
will skew a lot of these estimates

678
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:26,240
there's also small plots in terms of the

679
00:26:24,359 --> 00:26:27,759
physical size of the plot and the number

680
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:31,038
of individuals that can lead to

681
00:26:27,759 --> 00:26:33,398
unreliable data and a whopping 92% of

682
00:26:31,038 --> 00:26:35,398
the studies had experimental designs

683
00:26:33,398 --> 00:26:38,398
that would amplify Edge effects so it's

684
00:26:35,398 --> 00:26:40,398
something to keep an eye out for and

685
00:26:38,398 --> 00:26:42,519
yeah a very few studies actually

686
00:26:40,398 --> 00:26:44,639
measured yields within the center rows

687
00:26:42,519 --> 00:26:46,200
in for example in a four row plot

688
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:48,679
discarding the outer two rows and only

689
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:51,840
harvesting the

690
00:26:48,679 --> 00:26:54,399
center some last Quick stats on this um

691
00:26:51,839 --> 00:26:56,839
in terms of plants per plot it varied

692
00:26:54,398 --> 00:26:58,839
from anywhere from four plants to 900

693
00:26:56,839 --> 00:27:01,879
and 900 is is approaching the scale of a

694
00:26:58,839 --> 00:27:04,359
small scale yield trial but still the

695
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:07,320
there's around 40% of the studies

696
00:27:04,359 --> 00:27:10,599
measured less than 20 plants terms of

697
00:27:07,319 --> 00:27:12,398
plot replication 46% of them uh measured

698
00:27:10,599 --> 00:27:15,398
in less than three plots overall and

699
00:27:12,398 --> 00:27:17,439
typically this was only in a single year

700
00:27:15,398 --> 00:27:20,839
and in terms of multiple year testing

701
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:22,880
only us 63% of them tested in less than

702
00:27:20,839 --> 00:27:24,959
three years of testing so very little

703
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:26,919
validation often goes into some of these

704
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:28,919
large high impact papers which is kind

705
00:27:26,919 --> 00:27:32,520
of scary

706
00:27:28,919 --> 00:27:34,799
um in terms of not um or limited testing

707
00:27:32,519 --> 00:27:37,000
in Elite germ plasm this is an example

708
00:27:34,798 --> 00:27:39,319
from tobacco looking at tobacco yields

709
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:42,159
in a bunch of commercial uh tobacco

710
00:27:39,319 --> 00:27:44,398
hybrids and petite Havana and petite

711
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:46,440
Havana has been used in a lot of studies

712
00:27:44,398 --> 00:27:48,038
because it can be transformed but it's

713
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:51,440
also been used for a lot of yield

714
00:27:48,038 --> 00:27:53,398
estimates and uh some high impact papers

715
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:56,558
and the funny thing is is that petite

716
00:27:53,398 --> 00:27:59,398
Havana yields 1,600 per less than its

717
00:27:56,558 --> 00:28:03,319
commercial competitive counterparts so

718
00:27:59,398 --> 00:28:05,278
uh quite the difference um and 46% of

719
00:28:03,319 --> 00:28:08,278
the studies did not test an elite germ

720
00:28:05,278 --> 00:28:11,278
plasm and so this is a really common

721
00:28:08,278 --> 00:28:11,278
one

722
00:28:12,679 --> 00:28:17,159
um one of the um favorite analogies that

723
00:28:15,759 --> 00:28:19,319
I've heard for testing an elite

724
00:28:17,159 --> 00:28:23,679
germplasm is like changing a single part

725
00:28:19,319 --> 00:28:26,278
in a Model T versus a Ferrari and so um

726
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:28,038
Model T is not Elite or competitive and

727
00:28:26,278 --> 00:28:30,480
so any Improvement that you make to it

728
00:28:28,038 --> 00:28:32,640
will seem great um but it's limited in

729
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:34,278
its frame and its design by how fast it

730
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:36,200
can go given that

731
00:28:34,278 --> 00:28:37,720
Improvement but one of the main

732
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:39,399
arguments that I've gotten is that

733
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:41,960
they're available to academics to

734
00:28:39,398 --> 00:28:43,959
actually test they're transformable so

735
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:46,200
that's why folks use them and this is as

736
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:48,120
opposed to something like a Ferrari

737
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:50,240
that's Elite it's commercially

738
00:28:48,119 --> 00:28:53,239
competitive and so any Improvement that

739
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:57,000
you make to it will already add to a um

740
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:59,120
optimized engine and design but uh for

741
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:01,240
these typically they're only available

742
00:28:59,119 --> 00:29:02,839
to folks within industry or breeders

743
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:05,359
themselves given patent variety

744
00:29:02,839 --> 00:29:08,119
protection and outside of plant breeding

745
00:29:05,359 --> 00:29:10,479
most folks don't know that X patent

746
00:29:08,119 --> 00:29:13,678
variety protected lines exist for them

747
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:17,679
to test um and actually validate effects

748
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:21,600
in and I would kind of refer to these as

749
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:23,798
kind of like guyer's car and diners

750
00:29:21,599 --> 00:29:25,959
dive-ins and drives they are fairly

751
00:29:23,798 --> 00:29:27,879
competitive lines um and so any

752
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:30,120
improvements that you make in Yi can be

753
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:32,399
realistically tested in somewhat quality

754
00:29:30,119 --> 00:29:34,719
germ plasm and the best part is that

755
00:29:32,398 --> 00:29:37,839
they are available to academics to test

756
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:41,079
in so it's good

757
00:29:37,839 --> 00:29:42,639
ticket so bringing all of these things

758
00:29:41,079 --> 00:29:44,480
together I grouped a lot of the things

759
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:46,600
that I talked about into three General

760
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:48,880
categories and so they things like um

761
00:29:46,599 --> 00:29:50,678
controlling for moisture did they um

762
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:52,360
avoid Edge effects in their experimental

763
00:29:50,679 --> 00:29:55,679
design did they replicate their

764
00:29:52,359 --> 00:29:57,678
experiments um you know uh uh and did

765
00:29:55,679 --> 00:30:00,278
they test an elite germ plasm and if the

766
00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:03,559
study did that thing correctly I gave it

767
00:30:00,278 --> 00:30:05,558
a green box if they didn't do it well I

768
00:30:03,558 --> 00:30:07,398
gave it a black box and if it was

769
00:30:05,558 --> 00:30:09,918
unclear if that information wasn't

770
00:30:07,398 --> 00:30:12,599
provided I gave it a different color and

771
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:15,120
so looking across studies no one thing

772
00:30:12,599 --> 00:30:16,639
consistently goes wrong within them each

773
00:30:15,119 --> 00:30:18,678
of these studies shows a variable

774
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:20,320
experimental design and quality and so

775
00:30:18,679 --> 00:30:21,640
it's really important to check for a

776
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:25,960
number of different things when

777
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:25,960
evaluating the quality um of these

778
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:30,839
experiments and it's important to note

779
00:30:28,558 --> 00:30:32,839
that no single yield Gene has ever been

780
00:30:30,839 --> 00:30:35,278
commercialized and it's not from a lack

781
00:30:32,839 --> 00:30:37,240
of trying and this is as far as we can

782
00:30:35,278 --> 00:30:39,159
tell in the public data even though two

783
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:40,599
genes have gone through regulatory steps

784
00:30:39,159 --> 00:30:43,480
and I'll talk about one of them in the

785
00:30:40,599 --> 00:30:45,199
next slide but um this is one of my

786
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:47,759
favorite papers within the space it's

787
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:49,720
from Carl Simmons and it looks at a two

788
00:30:47,759 --> 00:30:53,200
decade long industry breeding program

789
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:56,278
where they tested 1,600 genes from 47

790
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:58,200
different species at scale in the field

791
00:30:56,278 --> 00:30:59,919
and they looked at things things uh for

792
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:01,960
growth and yields like water use

793
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:04,799
efficiency nitrogen use efficiency all

794
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:07,440
different kinds of traits and they found

795
00:31:04,798 --> 00:31:09,638
that of these 1600 genes only eight of

796
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:11,558
them significantly contributed to yield

797
00:31:09,638 --> 00:31:13,879
all the rest were either nonsignificant

798
00:31:11,558 --> 00:31:16,079
in Gray or significantly drug down

799
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:17,639
yields um in the environments that they

800
00:31:16,079 --> 00:31:20,918
were tested

801
00:31:17,638 --> 00:31:23,038
in the only Gene that has shown a lot of

802
00:31:20,919 --> 00:31:26,960
evidence and has gone through regulatory

803
00:31:23,038 --> 00:31:29,558
approval has been zmm 28 and it's amaz

804
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:31,679
or ma uh domestication transcription

805
00:31:29,558 --> 00:31:33,240
factor that across most of the

806
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:36,960
environments and conditions it was

807
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:39,240
tested in increases yield by around 2%

808
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:40,720
and one this is extraordinary because

809
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:43,440
you could statistically actually test

810
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:45,319
for a 2% yield Gene but then one or the

811
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:49,440
second thing is that this Gene actually

812
00:31:45,319 --> 00:31:53,720
exists um which feels very

813
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:55,240
rare very modest but rare um and so

814
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:57,600
given that a lot of these single yield

815
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:59,480
genes consistently get published in high

816
00:31:57,599 --> 00:32:02,319
impact journals I found it necessary to

817
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:04,519
write more of a policy piece uh to

818
00:32:02,319 --> 00:32:06,918
ensure that yield testing uh is more

819
00:32:04,519 --> 00:32:08,960
robust going forward and to do this I

820
00:32:06,919 --> 00:32:11,200
assembled a team of global domain

821
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:13,000
experts from across the fields of

822
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:14,919
quantitative genetics plant breeding

823
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:18,440
molecular biology and population

824
00:32:14,919 --> 00:32:20,919
genetics to write this perspective

825
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:22,840
piece and I'll say right now that all of

826
00:32:20,919 --> 00:32:25,278
these yield testing criteria aren't

827
00:32:22,839 --> 00:32:29,000
novel they're all written about in fiser

828
00:32:25,278 --> 00:32:31,759
1935 design of experience expent they're

829
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:33,240
uh published in kelb back's uh PhD

830
00:32:31,759 --> 00:32:35,638
dissertation from the University of

831
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:37,720
Nebraska Lincoln in 1917 so they've been

832
00:32:35,638 --> 00:32:39,959
around for a while and those are back in

833
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:42,200
the day when uh Planters Used to Be Drug

834
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:44,639
behind horses and they could still make

835
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:44,639
plots

836
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:49,440
well and so the criteria that we came up

837
00:32:47,638 --> 00:32:51,079
with were things like using standard

838
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:52,798
definitions of yield and so this is

839
00:32:51,079 --> 00:32:56,599
measuring plot yields versus single

840
00:32:52,798 --> 00:32:58,158
plant yields um this is testing for

841
00:32:56,599 --> 00:33:01,519
genotyp type by environment by

842
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:03,639
management effects it's matching on Farm

843
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:05,599
conditions and so this is thinking about

844
00:33:03,638 --> 00:33:07,000
plant competition and density and Edge

845
00:33:05,599 --> 00:33:09,599
effects as you're creating your

846
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:12,319
experimental blocks um and it's also

847
00:33:09,599 --> 00:33:16,038
following on Farm practices for planting

848
00:33:12,319 --> 00:33:18,240
and harvesting and fertilizer um

849
00:33:16,038 --> 00:33:19,759
applications there's also prioritizing

850
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:21,798
genes that plant breeding may have

851
00:33:19,759 --> 00:33:23,319
missed or uh checking to see that

852
00:33:21,798 --> 00:33:25,079
they're not already fixed within

853
00:33:23,319 --> 00:33:27,599
commercial breeding

854
00:33:25,079 --> 00:33:29,960
programs using appropriate controls and

855
00:33:27,599 --> 00:33:33,000
Elite germ plasm and so testing those

856
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:34,840
empty Vector controls and wild types and

857
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:37,159
then also developing collaborations

858
00:33:34,839 --> 00:33:39,439
because no one person knows how to do

859
00:33:37,159 --> 00:33:42,080
all of these

860
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:43,798
things and to kind of conclude all of

861
00:33:42,079 --> 00:33:47,240
these different projects in a mixed bag

862
00:33:43,798 --> 00:33:49,359
of a slide um anywhere from 1 to 32% of

863
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:51,519
intervals show some sort of plot tropy

864
00:33:49,359 --> 00:33:54,158
in Maze and most of this is noise

865
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:56,679
imparted through the gws process for

866
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:58,399
tees we found that primarily small tees

867
00:33:56,679 --> 00:34:00,080
that insert into known regulatory

868
00:33:58,398 --> 00:34:02,439
regions lead to the largest negative

869
00:34:00,079 --> 00:34:04,918
effects on gene expression and for

870
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:07,440
yields we redeveloped a set of yield

871
00:34:04,919 --> 00:34:08,878
testing standards to robustly test for

872
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:10,559
effects in the field and hopefully this

873
00:34:08,878 --> 00:34:12,918
will help researchers and reviewers in

874
00:34:10,559 --> 00:34:14,320
the future uh critically analyze this

875
00:34:12,918 --> 00:34:16,878
body of

876
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:18,919
work and a couple key lessons that I

877
00:34:16,878 --> 00:34:20,759
learned through my PhD I slipped this

878
00:34:18,918 --> 00:34:23,598
off into more scientific and personal

879
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:25,480
ones but the first is I can never escape

880
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:27,320
the constraints of Fisher and or they

881
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:31,159
are two people that are always is there

882
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:31,159
for me and they always bring me small

883
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:37,199
effects um a lab motto has been fail

884
00:34:35,039 --> 00:34:38,878
fast and I would build on that and say

885
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:41,158
building and nurturing the strength of

886
00:34:38,878 --> 00:34:42,918
fail fast is really um and and trusting

887
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:45,200
yourself in that process is really

888
00:34:42,918 --> 00:34:46,799
helpful to you know growth or my growth

889
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:49,239
and development as a

890
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:51,359
scientist and also I've used social

891
00:34:49,239 --> 00:34:53,319
media a lot especially Twitter as a

892
00:34:51,358 --> 00:34:55,239
platform for positive change within our

893
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:58,160
scientific Community to one call for

894
00:34:55,239 --> 00:34:59,959
more rigor within yield testing studies

895
00:34:58,159 --> 00:35:02,598
that led to the nature paper but then

896
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:05,440
also serving as you know probably some

897
00:35:02,599 --> 00:35:08,838
grad students reviewer number two and

898
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:10,280
correcting all of their yield things um

899
00:35:08,838 --> 00:35:12,039
and the second is calling for more

900
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:13,599
cultural change within our scientific

901
00:35:12,039 --> 00:35:16,119
societies that will hopefully end up

902
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:18,960
leading to better environments for our

903
00:35:16,119 --> 00:35:21,559
black brown and Indigenous uh

904
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:23,519
scientists in terms of her or personal

905
00:35:21,559 --> 00:35:24,960
things um I found that Community is

906
00:35:23,519 --> 00:35:27,079
really important and I'll talk about

907
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:29,199
mine in the next slide they're the folks

908
00:35:27,079 --> 00:35:32,200
that help keep you sane throughout this

909
00:35:29,199 --> 00:35:33,879
process and the last is you yourself are

910
00:35:32,199 --> 00:35:36,559
the most important project that you will

911
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:39,160
ever work on during your time at Cornell

912
00:35:36,559 --> 00:35:41,078
and no scientific project is worth your

913
00:35:39,159 --> 00:35:43,078
mental or physical well-being and so

914
00:35:41,079 --> 00:35:45,119
we're all here to develop and to learn

915
00:35:43,079 --> 00:35:46,640
and to grow and so as long as you

916
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:50,119
yourself are doing better than you

917
00:35:46,639 --> 00:35:50,118
yourself yesterday you're already

918
00:35:50,318 --> 00:35:54,400
winning in terms of finding Community

919
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:56,358
I've been really lucky to be a part of

920
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:58,000
synapsis and the indigenous grad Student

921
00:35:56,358 --> 00:36:00,400
Association ation over the past few

922
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,760
years that have provided a lot of great

923
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:05,960
uh friendships and uh sounding boards

924
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:08,079
for things um I'd also like to say thank

925
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:09,559
you to my family for supporting me this

926
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:11,440
entire time and through this very

927
00:36:09,559 --> 00:36:14,400
stressful process so I'm very thankful

928
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:15,800
for them I'm also thankful to a lot of

929
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:17,280
the mentors that have helped me along

930
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:19,839
the way and these are the folks that

931
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:21,119
taught me genetics and statistics folks

932
00:36:19,838 --> 00:36:23,279
that have helped me through a lot of

933
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:24,920
different projects and encourage me to

934
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:26,920
get into some of my first research

935
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:28,680
experiences as well as folks that to

936
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:31,200
have helped me move on to the next stage

937
00:36:28,679 --> 00:36:33,000
of my career and find jobs along with my

938
00:36:31,199 --> 00:36:36,639
mom who's filming all of this from the

939
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:40,000
back supporting me this whole

940
00:36:36,639 --> 00:36:41,838
time um I'd also like to say thanks to

941
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,400
the mentors that are no longer with us

942
00:36:41,838 --> 00:36:46,880
uh my Master's CIS adviser Don o passed

943
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:49,519
away in 2021 and he always said that for

944
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:51,079
this talk he'd be uh he'd drive here and

945
00:36:49,519 --> 00:36:52,838
sit in the front row and so that's why

946
00:36:51,079 --> 00:36:54,760
there is a seat with the blanket uh

947
00:36:52,838 --> 00:36:57,279
reserved for

948
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:59,400
him uh and last but not least I'd like

949
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:01,240
to thank the uh buckler lab for all of

950
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:04,119
their help throughout various projects

951
00:37:01,239 --> 00:37:05,679
my committee Cedric and wch um along

952
00:37:04,119 --> 00:37:07,400
with the American Indian and Indigenous

953
00:37:05,679 --> 00:37:08,759
studies program if not for them I

954
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:11,079
wouldn't have written my last three

955
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:13,599
papers or dissertation and so very

956
00:37:11,079 --> 00:37:16,039
thankful for them um and I have been

957
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:18,200
funded over the past few years by an Nea

958
00:37:16,039 --> 00:37:20,159
pre-doctoral Fellowship um and that's

959
00:37:18,199 --> 00:37:22,799
been great and so with that I'd be happy

960
00:37:20,159 --> 00:37:22,799
to take any

961
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:29,079
questions a question and a comment I

962
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:32,800
wonder if you're finding that player

963
00:37:29,079 --> 00:37:34,839
chopy plays a smaller role than folks

964
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:39,160
previously bought is related to the fact

965
00:37:34,838 --> 00:37:40,719
that maybe we can now dissect phenotypes

966
00:37:39,159 --> 00:37:46,000
better like we understand what a

967
00:37:40,719 --> 00:37:47,719
phenotype is and and what are distinct

968
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:50,280
phenotypes

969
00:37:47,719 --> 00:37:52,318
then yeah I think a lot of it has to do

970
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:53,880
with the type of Association models that

971
00:37:52,318 --> 00:37:56,639
people were using before because a lot

972
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:58,119
of Pat tropy was called the qtl studies

973
00:37:56,639 --> 00:38:00,318
and that just makes it seem like a whole

974
00:37:58,119 --> 00:38:01,880
chromosome arm is significant as opposed

975
00:38:00,318 --> 00:38:04,920
to gwas that gives

976
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:09,039
you a likely list of candidates that are

977
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:10,960
causal um and so yeah my comment is that

978
00:38:09,039 --> 00:38:12,880
actually is also kind of form of a

979
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:15,240
question that the last bit that you

980
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:17,039
talked about I wonder to what degree you

981
00:38:15,239 --> 00:38:21,719
think that these

982
00:38:17,039 --> 00:38:24,440
over extending of of validity of R of

983
00:38:21,719 --> 00:38:27,838
scientific papers it's driven by the

984
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:30,358
people who WR them or the the editors of

985
00:38:27,838 --> 00:38:32,440
journals that push folks particularly

986
00:38:30,358 --> 00:38:35,799
these highly visible

987
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:38,318
papers I I you know if I was to play

988
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:43,079
play play the play my suggestion would

989
00:38:38,318 --> 00:38:44,880
be 80% editors % people who submit to

990
00:38:43,079 --> 00:38:47,200
pressure I wonder what your thought is

991
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:50,680
that you actually very carefully read

992
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:52,358
all those papers yeah I think it's a

993
00:38:50,679 --> 00:38:54,559
little bit of a mixed bag I think a lot

994
00:38:52,358 --> 00:38:56,519
of the responsibility goes to editors

995
00:38:54,559 --> 00:38:58,279
because they are responsible for finding

996
00:38:56,519 --> 00:38:59,800
the correct peer reviewers for these

997
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:02,480
kinds of articles

998
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:04,519
that typically these yield studies tend

999
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:07,440
to only be like a couple of sentences or

1000
00:39:04,519 --> 00:39:09,000
a table in the supplementary info and so

1001
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:10,838
they typically try to find reviewers

1002
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:13,119
that can cover the majority of the paper

1003
00:39:10,838 --> 00:39:14,960
versus a couple sentences and I think

1004
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:18,599
that's a lot of the reason why these

1005
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:20,760
things can get published eventually um

1006
00:39:18,599 --> 00:39:24,240
but they also attractive yeah they are

1007
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:28,119
also highly cited and uh really yeah

1008
00:39:24,239 --> 00:39:31,000
well used so it's it's

1009
00:39:28,119 --> 00:39:32,720
yeah dear superb talk thanks I had a

1010
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:34,599
related question to voyex about

1011
00:39:32,719 --> 00:39:36,239
publication I mean plant gentic as a

1012
00:39:34,599 --> 00:39:38,519
whole has just churned out massive

1013
00:39:36,239 --> 00:39:40,159
volumes of gws studies most of those

1014
00:39:38,519 --> 00:39:42,559
hits don't get used and it's always felt

1015
00:39:40,159 --> 00:39:44,920
like a part of that is that a gws fits

1016
00:39:42,559 --> 00:39:47,239
in a dissertation and a variety doesn't

1017
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:49,079
12 years to make a variety three years

1018
00:39:47,239 --> 00:39:51,439
you know field trial plus analysis and

1019
00:39:49,079 --> 00:39:54,560
writing for a GS same with qil maing

1020
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:57,318
before it and test out five GS models

1021
00:39:54,559 --> 00:39:59,519
after it have you thought as somebody's

1022
00:39:57,318 --> 00:40:02,119
thought like really heavily and looked

1023
00:39:59,519 --> 00:40:03,719
at these and and looked at 25 of them

1024
00:40:02,119 --> 00:40:06,838
very intent and thought about them int I

1025
00:40:03,719 --> 00:40:08,159
mean have you do you have thoughts on

1026
00:40:06,838 --> 00:40:10,880
one if you feel like that statement I

1027
00:40:08,159 --> 00:40:14,759
just made is true and then two if you

1028
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:16,640
have thoughts about how in a field where

1029
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:18,880
start to finish the process takes 12

1030
00:40:16,639 --> 00:40:22,039
years nobody wants to stay for that for

1031
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:24,079
PhD what how we could how we could

1032
00:40:22,039 --> 00:40:25,519
mitigate that and start having more

1033
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:28,119
things that are relevant to variety

1034
00:40:25,519 --> 00:40:29,239
development but that fit within a 5 six

1035
00:40:28,119 --> 00:40:32,519
year time

1036
00:40:29,239 --> 00:40:35,838
span yeah that's a little hard

1037
00:40:32,519 --> 00:40:38,800
um solve the

1038
00:40:35,838 --> 00:40:41,159
field I mean in the second version of

1039
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:43,079
our guilt paper like we talk about ways

1040
00:40:41,159 --> 00:40:44,960
in which to describe your results in a

1041
00:40:43,079 --> 00:40:46,480
way that's not like this Gene will

1042
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:48,920
change the future of Agriculture and

1043
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:51,199
increase yield by like 50% it's more

1044
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:52,680
modest in that like future or additional

1045
00:40:51,199 --> 00:40:54,838
testing that's needed before it can be

1046
00:40:52,679 --> 00:40:56,279
used in the field or you know talking

1047
00:40:54,838 --> 00:40:58,119
about it differently with industry part

1048
00:40:56,280 --> 00:41:00,040
partners for example who have the better

1049
00:40:58,119 --> 00:41:02,119
abilities at scaling this and so in that

1050
00:41:00,039 --> 00:41:03,719
way you still get a paper that's still

1051
00:41:02,119 --> 00:41:07,200
important and show the importance of a

1052
00:41:03,719 --> 00:41:09,679
gene but um yeah

1053
00:41:07,199 --> 00:41:11,318
it's it's hard when the the cycle of

1054
00:41:09,679 --> 00:41:13,399
Academia is really short and dependent

1055
00:41:11,318 --> 00:41:15,159
on a grad student or a postto and it's

1056
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:17,039
hard to say where the responsibility

1057
00:41:15,159 --> 00:41:19,879
lies in some of these larger projects

1058
00:41:17,039 --> 00:41:24,719
but I would say write about the results

1059
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:24,720
a little bit differently and and go from

1060
00:41:25,239 --> 00:41:28,239
there

1061
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:38,200
Mark says he's gonna use this paper in

1062
00:41:36,358 --> 00:41:42,318
his class that's

1063
00:41:38,199 --> 00:41:42,318
cool I'm sorry to Future grad

1064
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:46,880
students it already is being used at a

1065
00:41:45,559 --> 00:41:50,719
number of

1066
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:53,838
universities yeah uh no questions in the

1067
00:41:50,719 --> 00:41:56,838
chat yeah so the the genes that are

1068
00:41:53,838 --> 00:41:58,639
essentially having no relationship to

1069
00:41:56,838 --> 00:42:00,639
yield are

1070
00:41:58,639 --> 00:42:02,960
they and this might be more of a

1071
00:42:00,639 --> 00:42:05,118
speculative question but are they genes

1072
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:07,920
that are not actually scaling up and

1073
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:10,680
have no relationship to yield or do you

1074
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:12,400
think that they are genes that have

1075
00:42:10,679 --> 00:42:14,318
something that is relevant but only to

1076
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:17,000
that scaled down experiment for instance

1077
00:42:14,318 --> 00:42:18,480
maybe that field did not have enough

1078
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:21,760
water and so it's actually a drought

1079
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:23,599
related Gene that actually

1080
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:26,440
increased

1081
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:28,039
uh I think they're typically sometimes

1082
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:29,920
only good in some of those smaller

1083
00:42:28,039 --> 00:42:33,039
experiments there have been a number of

1084
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:34,960
studies from industry looking at how

1085
00:42:33,039 --> 00:42:36,838
variable these single Gene effects are

1086
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:39,280
by environment and they show just

1087
00:42:36,838 --> 00:42:41,719
gigantic G by effects and

1088
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:43,200
so for any one of these genes to

1089
00:42:41,719 --> 00:42:45,358
actually go through the regulatory

1090
00:42:43,199 --> 00:42:47,000
process it costs like hundreds of

1091
00:42:45,358 --> 00:42:48,719
millions of dollars in order to do all

1092
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:50,880
the safety all the yield trials in

1093
00:42:48,719 --> 00:42:52,799
different locations and so whenever an

1094
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:54,200
industry uh company wants to

1095
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:55,559
commercialize one of these genes they

1096
00:42:54,199 --> 00:42:57,318
need to make sure that it's stable

1097
00:42:55,559 --> 00:43:00,480
across the majority of environments that

1098
00:42:57,318 --> 00:43:02,358
it's in and so that's why zmm 28 is one

1099
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:04,480
of those rare exceptions of like they're

1100
00:43:02,358 --> 00:43:06,598
not willing to pay $200 million for a

1101
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:08,318
one environment one condition kind of

1102
00:43:06,599 --> 00:43:11,119
yield Gene as opposed to something that

1103
00:43:08,318 --> 00:43:13,358
will work well across a lot more

1104
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:15,358
hopefully that answers your

1105
00:43:13,358 --> 00:43:18,159
question did I make a comment as

1106
00:43:15,358 --> 00:43:18,159
supposed asking a

1107
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:24,599
question uh I just wanted to say that I

1108
00:43:22,159 --> 00:43:26,879
there's an uncommon amount of wisdom in

1109
00:43:24,599 --> 00:43:30,119
the talk that you just gave as opposed

1110
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:32,559
to results and you know schol analyses

1111
00:43:30,119 --> 00:43:35,920
or whatever it's a different order of

1112
00:43:32,559 --> 00:43:38,000
things and so my comment has to do is is

1113
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:40,960
one that I want everybody to hear I'm a

1114
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:44,719
little scared about saying this

1115
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:47,280
but two things that you said that that

1116
00:43:44,719 --> 00:43:50,959
are really strong one thing that you

1117
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:53,359
said was I was never meant to be here

1118
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:55,358
and the other thing that you said was uh

1119
00:43:53,358 --> 00:43:57,279
cultural change is a really important

1120
00:43:55,358 --> 00:43:58,799
thing

1121
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:02,839
so I just want to make sure that our

1122
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:02,839
audience is hearing that and thank

1123
00:44:04,199 --> 00:44:08,199
you

1124
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:12,760
[Laughter]

1125
00:44:08,199 --> 00:44:15,159
thanks question yeah thank you

1126
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:17,720
for I'm kind of interested about your

1127
00:44:15,159 --> 00:44:20,759
take like what would be the evolutionary

1128
00:44:17,719 --> 00:44:22,719
role of Lop be and transposable elements

1129
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:26,800
in your opinion regard more on the

1130
00:44:22,719 --> 00:44:28,279
backseat or dri that opportunity

1131
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:31,039
I think they might lead to some of the

1132
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:33,119
larger adaptive changes especially tees

1133
00:44:31,039 --> 00:44:34,558
themselves because some of these effects

1134
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:36,720
have led to some of the really large

1135
00:44:34,559 --> 00:44:38,519
domestication genes for example or

1136
00:44:36,719 --> 00:44:40,078
radical changes in gene expression

1137
00:44:38,519 --> 00:44:42,239
especially under like stressful

1138
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:44,960
conditions like salt or drought a lot of

1139
00:44:42,239 --> 00:44:48,039
tees can get activated and so I think

1140
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:50,960
there is a really large impact even

1141
00:44:48,039 --> 00:44:54,000
though right now for things like yields

1142
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:54,960
it doesn't seem like it um and as for

1143
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,719
Pat

1144
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:59,639
tropy I I still think it exists I still

1145
00:44:57,719 --> 00:45:01,519
think it's out there but a common

1146
00:44:59,639 --> 00:45:04,519
limitation to what we're doing is that

1147
00:45:01,519 --> 00:45:05,759
gwas can only look for petrop and common

1148
00:45:04,519 --> 00:45:08,239
variants because you need like

1149
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:11,920
segregating alals you could still have

1150
00:45:08,239 --> 00:45:14,039
Pat tropy at fixed Loi like TV1 um

1151
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:15,599
because you have a lot more safety in

1152
00:45:14,039 --> 00:45:19,039
fixation you can't lose critical

1153
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:20,838
functions if that Gene gets lost or um

1154
00:45:19,039 --> 00:45:23,358
yeah the Leal frequency changes and it's

1155
00:45:20,838 --> 00:45:28,679
no longer prevalent in population and so

1156
00:45:23,358 --> 00:45:28,679
it it still has some effect but not uh

1157
00:45:36,519 --> 00:45:42,719
M oh we don't need bonus slides okay

1158
00:45:40,519 --> 00:45:45,599
uh your thoughts on canidate Gene

1159
00:45:42,719 --> 00:45:47,838
identification could be refined for re

1160
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:49,559
relevance to Elite germ plasm and

1161
00:45:47,838 --> 00:45:51,599
breeding programs often we rely on

1162
00:45:49,559 --> 00:45:53,880
insights from gws and very diverse

1163
00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:55,838
Association panels which typically don't

1164
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:57,800
have as much applied relevance in

1165
00:45:55,838 --> 00:46:00,799
structured breeding

1166
00:45:57,800 --> 00:46:00,800
programs

1167
00:46:01,519 --> 00:46:06,679
um so that I'm not sure sometimes going

1168
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:08,838
to other species and finding genes that

1169
00:46:06,679 --> 00:46:12,480
haven't already been tested for a long

1170
00:46:08,838 --> 00:46:13,920
time within the same species can help um

1171
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:16,039
some of even the yield genes that have

1172
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:17,960
been published before do have a lot of

1173
00:46:16,039 --> 00:46:19,400
Promise because sometimes they're

1174
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:21,760
introduced from different speces and you

1175
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:26,400
can have novel effects that haven't been

1176
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:29,319
tested so maybe there um is a start

1177
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:29,318
hope it answers your

1178
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:37,920
question thank us for May providing us

1179
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:48,960
wisdom this has been a production of
