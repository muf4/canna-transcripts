1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:05,350
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:05,349
University

3
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:11,919
all right thanks Tony appreciate

4
00:00:09,669 --> 00:00:13,179
everyone coming out this afternoon so

5
00:00:11,919 --> 00:00:14,949
I'm gonna be talking about perennial

6
00:00:13,179 --> 00:00:16,809
greens this is a bit of a new area of

7
00:00:14,949 --> 00:00:18,278
research for me so I don't have a whole

8
00:00:16,809 --> 00:00:20,500
lot of data to show you but I'm going to

9
00:00:18,278 --> 00:00:23,050
be telling you what we're up to in my

10
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:27,099
lab and so I'm I just want to share a

11
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:30,939
little little nugget of information so

12
00:00:27,099 --> 00:00:32,829
on my on my profile online for the the

13
00:00:30,939 --> 00:00:35,079
section not the department I have a

14
00:00:32,829 --> 00:00:37,030
research description and I say what I'm

15
00:00:35,079 --> 00:00:40,239
interested in and cover crops as Tony

16
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:42,189
was mentioning sustainable cropping

17
00:00:40,238 --> 00:00:44,140
systems ecological weed management and I

18
00:00:42,189 --> 00:00:46,299
have two words so I say I'm interested

19
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:49,659
in perennial greens and I received more

20
00:00:46,299 --> 00:00:52,268
comments students enquiries coming in

21
00:00:49,659 --> 00:00:54,459
from outside asking about that those two

22
00:00:52,268 --> 00:00:56,679
words out of a hundred word description

23
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:58,239
of my research then than anything else

24
00:00:56,679 --> 00:01:00,399
that I do even though I'm not doing a

25
00:00:58,238 --> 00:01:02,768
whole lot of work in this area quite yet

26
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:05,500
so there's a lot of interest and I hope

27
00:01:02,768 --> 00:01:07,959
you enjoy what what I have to offer here

28
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:09,250
so I have a lot of slides so I want to

29
00:01:07,959 --> 00:01:11,049
just go through and tell you what the

30
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:12,579
take-home messages are first in case we

31
00:01:11,049 --> 00:01:14,709
don't get to the end of the presentation

32
00:01:12,579 --> 00:01:16,239
and that is that perennial greens are

33
00:01:14,709 --> 00:01:17,859
becoming an option all right

34
00:01:16,239 --> 00:01:19,359
for the longest time people have just

35
00:01:17,859 --> 00:01:21,519
talked about this is more of a dream

36
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:23,859
well now it's becoming a reality

37
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:26,679
so there's increasing interest and

38
00:01:23,859 --> 00:01:28,569
consumer demand people have gotten wind

39
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:30,630
of what's going on there are people that

40
00:01:28,569 --> 00:01:33,219
are seeking out perennial green products

41
00:01:30,629 --> 00:01:34,719
and there are processors that are very

42
00:01:33,219 --> 00:01:37,090
interested in getting their hands on

43
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:40,179
this grain so really exciting time to be

44
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:42,250
working on perennial grains what fits

45
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:43,450
into my research program and one of the

46
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:45,129
reasons why I'm very interested in

47
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:47,260
kernel grains is because they have a

48
00:01:45,129 --> 00:01:48,939
potential to provide ecosystem services

49
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:51,880
and increase the sustainability of

50
00:01:48,939 --> 00:01:53,319
cropping systems okay when we're

51
00:01:51,879 --> 00:01:55,869
thinking about perennial grains because

52
00:01:53,319 --> 00:01:58,599
this is a new new type of crop the

53
00:01:55,870 --> 00:02:01,450
integration strategy is really important

54
00:01:58,599 --> 00:02:03,149
and critical for success okay so exactly

55
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:06,040
how we go about growing these crops

56
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:08,379
where on the landscape they're they're

57
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:10,269
planted and how they're managed alright

58
00:02:08,378 --> 00:02:13,989
so that that's really important and then

59
00:02:10,269 --> 00:02:15,909
with also being a new crop guidelines we

60
00:02:13,989 --> 00:02:17,740
need we need to understand how these

61
00:02:15,909 --> 00:02:19,449
crops grow and we need some more

62
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:20,080
information so that we can share this

63
00:02:19,449 --> 00:02:21,879
information with

64
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,830
farmers and provide them with

65
00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:27,849
information on best management practices

66
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:29,530
in ways to optimize production okay so

67
00:02:27,849 --> 00:02:30,939
before I go any further I just want to

68
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:33,430
highlight some of the people who are

69
00:02:30,939 --> 00:02:34,120
involved in this research at Cornell and

70
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:36,939
beyond

71
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:39,129
saundra Wayman she's really uh so in the

72
00:02:36,939 --> 00:02:41,079
front here she's been really leading the

73
00:02:39,129 --> 00:02:43,599
charge keeping this project together so

74
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:46,480
very happy to have her involved Valentin

75
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:50,019
Debray so this is Valentin this is a an

76
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:52,419
intern from France from esra Lyon who

77
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:54,790
came over this past summer and helped

78
00:02:52,419 --> 00:02:56,969
with some of the research Eugene law is

79
00:02:54,789 --> 00:02:59,679
a new graduate student right here

80
00:02:56,969 --> 00:03:02,349
working with Toni ditomasso and myself

81
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:04,360
and then Steve Coleman so this is Steve

82
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:05,799
you know having its arms up here saying

83
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:09,010
why aren't people growing more perennial

84
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:11,380
greens so he was actually from Cornell

85
00:03:09,009 --> 00:03:13,179
yet he's an alum so it came through the

86
00:03:11,379 --> 00:03:16,030
program here at Cornell he's at Ohio

87
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:18,159
State University now he's really was my

88
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:19,930
entryway into with working with

89
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:21,639
perennial green so he's when it really

90
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:24,370
got me first interested in this work and

91
00:03:21,639 --> 00:03:26,349
then lead to Han he came and actually

92
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:28,360
gave a seminar in this section a couple

93
00:03:26,349 --> 00:03:29,620
of years ago talking about some of the

94
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:33,820
updates of his work at the land

95
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:37,780
institute ok so why why focus on

96
00:03:33,819 --> 00:03:40,000
perennial greens so again thinking about

97
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:41,620
why I'm really interested in this it's a

98
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,590
lot of it has to do with climate change

99
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:45,159
if you remember Mike Hoffman's

100
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:48,459
presentation earlier in the semester

101
00:03:45,159 --> 00:03:50,069
climate change is a really big big deal

102
00:03:48,459 --> 00:03:51,819
for agriculture there are a lot of

103
00:03:50,069 --> 00:03:52,930
challenges associated with climate

104
00:03:51,819 --> 00:03:54,699
change in the future

105
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:56,409
associated with the projections and I

106
00:03:54,699 --> 00:03:59,289
see perennial grains as a way to deal

107
00:03:56,409 --> 00:04:01,750
with some of those challenges the recent

108
00:03:59,289 --> 00:04:03,189
advances in crop breeding I think are

109
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:06,400
really exciting and so there's

110
00:04:03,189 --> 00:04:08,289
opportunity for seeing some pretty fast

111
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:12,459
progress over the next several years

112
00:04:08,289 --> 00:04:14,229
with perennial greens and then ecosystem

113
00:04:12,459 --> 00:04:16,478
services people are starting to

114
00:04:14,229 --> 00:04:18,548
understand the importance of ecosystem

115
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:20,709
services and the importance of how we

116
00:04:18,548 --> 00:04:23,319
manage our landscapes our agricultural

117
00:04:20,709 --> 00:04:25,149
landscape so that we can achieve not

118
00:04:23,319 --> 00:04:26,500
only food production but also some of

119
00:04:25,149 --> 00:04:30,538
these other environmental benefits that

120
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:33,939
we get from agro ecosystems okay so with

121
00:04:30,538 --> 00:04:36,189
ecosystem services in 2005 Jonathan Pohl

122
00:04:33,939 --> 00:04:38,379
publish this paper global consequences

123
00:04:36,189 --> 00:04:41,139
of land use and was really calling for

124
00:04:38,379 --> 00:04:43,149
an integration of of what we're seeing

125
00:04:41,139 --> 00:04:45,639
in natural ecosystems where you have a

126
00:04:43,149 --> 00:04:47,259
lot of ecosystem services in this flower

127
00:04:45,639 --> 00:04:48,819
diagram these are represented up here

128
00:04:47,259 --> 00:04:51,459
from forest production and carbon

129
00:04:48,819 --> 00:04:53,709
sequestration number of these on the

130
00:04:51,459 --> 00:04:55,000
bottom of the flower diagram here and

131
00:04:53,709 --> 00:04:57,399
that's quite a bit different from

132
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,970
intensive cropland where the primary

133
00:04:57,399 --> 00:05:02,439
goal is is crop production ok and so

134
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:04,450
what we're trying to do here is to

135
00:05:02,439 --> 00:05:06,189
combine these two alright so that we get

136
00:05:04,449 --> 00:05:07,899
the best of both worlds and that's what

137
00:05:06,189 --> 00:05:09,639
we're seeing here with this cropland

138
00:05:07,899 --> 00:05:11,169
with restored ecosystem services and

139
00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:15,370
we're seeing perennial greens as an

140
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:19,270
opportunity to achieve this ok there was

141
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:24,040
a published not too long ago looking at

142
00:05:19,269 --> 00:05:26,049
the the way that we can put perennials

143
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:27,069
and this in this case are talking about

144
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:30,310
perennials in general not necessarily

145
00:05:27,069 --> 00:05:32,829
perennial greens but how we can place

146
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:34,780
these on the landscape to increase

147
00:05:32,829 --> 00:05:38,109
ecosystem services and what they're

148
00:05:34,779 --> 00:05:40,329
seeing is that with just a small amount

149
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:42,189
of perennials in the landscape we can

150
00:05:40,329 --> 00:05:44,529
dramatically increase the amount of

151
00:05:42,189 --> 00:05:46,360
ecosystem services that we're we're

152
00:05:44,529 --> 00:05:49,869
receiving from these agro-ecosystem 's

153
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:54,819
and also achieve green or crop

154
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:59,040
production at the same time ok so we

155
00:05:54,819 --> 00:06:01,149
think about why why why we're focused on

156
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:02,980
perennial cropping systems perennial

157
00:06:01,149 --> 00:06:05,379
greens one of the reasons is because

158
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:07,660
there are challenges with annual

159
00:06:05,379 --> 00:06:09,310
cropping systems and if you think take a

160
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:11,200
step back and you think about annual

161
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:13,720
cropping systems and the ecology of

162
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:15,789
annual cropping systems we know that

163
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:17,530
these are good in that they are highly

164
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:20,950
productive so we're getting a lot of

165
00:06:17,529 --> 00:06:24,369
food out of annual cropping systems ok

166
00:06:20,949 --> 00:06:27,849
but they often require very large

167
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:30,100
amounts of external inputs ok so rich

168
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:32,740
Smith came and gave a presentation in

169
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:35,340
the section several years ago and he had

170
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:37,509
a paper that came out looking at

171
00:06:35,339 --> 00:06:39,909
agriculture energy use environmental

172
00:06:37,509 --> 00:06:42,879
impact and he called into question

173
00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:44,080
annual cropping systems and said that

174
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:45,879
you know what we're really trying to do

175
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:47,158
here is maintain this perpetual state of

176
00:06:45,879 --> 00:06:49,379
secondary succession

177
00:06:47,158 --> 00:06:50,879
of initial secondary succession all

178
00:06:49,379 --> 00:06:52,439
right and so we're doing that with

179
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:54,989
disturbance and we're doing that to

180
00:06:52,439 --> 00:06:57,300
increase resource availability okay so

181
00:06:54,988 --> 00:06:59,488
in ecological terms we're using these

182
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:01,468
inputs to make resources available for

183
00:06:59,488 --> 00:07:04,348
these plants that we want to grow okay

184
00:07:01,468 --> 00:07:06,718
and the environmental impacts associated

185
00:07:04,348 --> 00:07:09,778
with annual cropping systems is directly

186
00:07:06,718 --> 00:07:12,988
related to the the energy that's

187
00:07:09,778 --> 00:07:15,418
required to maintain that state of

188
00:07:12,988 --> 00:07:18,149
initial secondary succession okay

189
00:07:15,418 --> 00:07:20,338
so some more background information just

190
00:07:18,149 --> 00:07:22,889
here to set the stage if we look at

191
00:07:20,338 --> 00:07:24,868
annual cropping systems alright there's

192
00:07:22,889 --> 00:07:28,168
an example we see that there could be a

193
00:07:24,869 --> 00:07:30,389
lot of evapotranspiration or evaporation

194
00:07:28,168 --> 00:07:32,008
excuse me a lot of runoff okay

195
00:07:30,389 --> 00:07:36,749
especially if you're on a sloped land

196
00:07:32,009 --> 00:07:40,079
like we have a lot of in New York this

197
00:07:36,749 --> 00:07:42,229
is a photograph from 2015 all right at

198
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:46,348
the musgrave research farm seeing some

199
00:07:42,228 --> 00:07:48,389
railroading here and so in 2015 in june

200
00:07:46,348 --> 00:07:50,668
there was quite a bit of rain so we had

201
00:07:48,389 --> 00:07:53,519
about 8 inches of rain where our

202
00:07:50,668 --> 00:07:56,519
long-term average is about 4 and at the

203
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:58,319
research farm and for all of you who do

204
00:07:56,519 --> 00:08:00,300
field research who are around this

205
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:02,669
summer we know that this past summer

206
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:04,588
2016 it didn't look anything like this

207
00:08:02,668 --> 00:08:05,938
it was actually the complete opposite we

208
00:08:04,588 --> 00:08:08,718
had less than one inch

209
00:08:05,939 --> 00:08:12,659
okay so we're seeing these dramatic

210
00:08:08,718 --> 00:08:15,928
swings in environmental conditions in in

211
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:17,879
rainfall patterns and you know I think

212
00:08:15,928 --> 00:08:19,288
this is going to continue and we really

213
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:22,528
need to help farmers deal with some of

214
00:08:19,288 --> 00:08:24,829
these issues ok so going back to this

215
00:08:22,528 --> 00:08:26,999
diagram comparing annual and perennial

216
00:08:24,829 --> 00:08:29,908
cropping systems perennial grains here

217
00:08:26,999 --> 00:08:31,669
so you see these differences so a couple

218
00:08:29,908 --> 00:08:33,990
things that I want to point out so

219
00:08:31,668 --> 00:08:36,389
evaporation decreasing because we're

220
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:39,719
having more ground cover here ok you

221
00:08:36,389 --> 00:08:41,610
also see a larger nutrient pool that can

222
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:43,740
be accessed by these roots that go down

223
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:46,709
deeper with perennial grains compared to

224
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:49,139
annual grains ok let's run off in

225
00:08:46,708 --> 00:08:50,369
erosion alright and the other thing

226
00:08:49,139 --> 00:08:52,769
that's happening here if you look at the

227
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:54,720
the diagram of the sons all right here

228
00:08:52,769 --> 00:08:56,399
we're using resources over an extended

229
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,559
period of time with perennial grain

230
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:59,899
cropping systems all right we're annuals

231
00:08:58,558 --> 00:09:02,819
you're planting and

232
00:08:59,899 --> 00:09:05,220
april/may okay you're missing out on

233
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:07,680
some of those heat units that happen

234
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:08,970
before you plant your crop all right and

235
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:10,919
the same thing after you harvest your

236
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:12,450
crop in the fall so with perennial

237
00:09:10,919 --> 00:09:14,490
grains you're really taking advantage of

238
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:19,170
all the resources that are available

239
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:20,850
throughout the year okay so there are

240
00:09:19,169 --> 00:09:23,759
two main approaches for developing

241
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:26,759
perennial grains one is to domesticate a

242
00:09:23,759 --> 00:09:29,429
wild crop or a wild perennial excuse me

243
00:09:26,759 --> 00:09:33,360
and the other one is to cross a crop an

244
00:09:29,429 --> 00:09:36,089
annual crop with a penny already two

245
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:38,460
main approaches for developing perennial

246
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:40,379
grain crops and what the breeders are

247
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:42,210
really trying to do is combine multiple

248
00:09:40,379 --> 00:09:44,399
desirable traits so they're looking at

249
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:46,980
regrowth per any allottee is really

250
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:48,990
important for perennial grains okay and

251
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:50,639
high yield so we're trying to get both

252
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:53,060
of these together into the same plant

253
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:55,199
all right obviously they should also be

254
00:09:53,059 --> 00:09:58,079
somewhat tolerant abiotic and biotic

255
00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:00,240
stresses so those are the the goals for

256
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:02,430
the plant breeders and one of the big

257
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:04,980
success stories is with intermediate

258
00:10:02,429 --> 00:10:06,959
wheat grass all right so this is um

259
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:10,110
the scientific name is thin opium

260
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:11,670
intermedium it's also called turns ax

261
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:14,039
this is the trade name that was

262
00:10:11,669 --> 00:10:16,769
developed by the land Institute so this

263
00:10:14,039 --> 00:10:18,689
is Leda Han is the the plant breeder at

264
00:10:16,769 --> 00:10:22,169
the Land Institute he's been developing

265
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:25,320
this particular crop so this was first

266
00:10:22,169 --> 00:10:27,779
identified in 1983 by Peggy Wagner down

267
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:28,980
at the the Rodale Institute they called

268
00:10:27,779 --> 00:10:30,839
it something different down there they

269
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:32,430
called it wild tree --ga that name is

270
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:37,170
not stuck where Kearns o has really

271
00:10:32,429 --> 00:10:39,569
taken off okay and this this plant this

272
00:10:37,169 --> 00:10:42,689
was identified out of a screening that

273
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:44,490
involved over a hundred plants a hundred

274
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:46,830
different species and they found that

275
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:50,909
this one was the best in terms of having

276
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:52,470
these desirable characteristics okay so

277
00:10:50,909 --> 00:10:55,620
this is what the grain looks like

278
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:58,290
alright it has a hole on it so like oats

279
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:59,970
so that's a one issue that we've been

280
00:10:58,289 --> 00:11:02,909
dealing with is trying to figure out how

281
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:04,500
to get this stuff clean and what's

282
00:11:02,909 --> 00:11:06,509
really exciting is that we're now seeing

283
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:08,850
the first commercial production of this

284
00:11:06,509 --> 00:11:11,939
crop alright so these are some plots and

285
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:13,509
this is in Kansas looking at combine

286
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:15,699
harvests of the

287
00:11:13,509 --> 00:11:18,370
the Kern's up and this is what the grain

288
00:11:15,698 --> 00:11:19,958
looks like all right I think this is the

289
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:24,009
nicest picture of the grain that I've

290
00:11:19,958 --> 00:11:26,649
ever seen our grain you know the brain

291
00:11:24,009 --> 00:11:29,470
that we grew here in New York doesn't

292
00:11:26,649 --> 00:11:31,089
quite look as nice but we're getting

293
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:33,040
there I'm just going to pass this around

294
00:11:31,089 --> 00:11:38,259
so you can see you know this stuff is

295
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:40,899
real okay and what's really exciting is

296
00:11:38,259 --> 00:11:43,659
that the first commercial product is now

297
00:11:40,899 --> 00:11:45,610
available so Patagonia the clothing

298
00:11:43,659 --> 00:11:48,549
company outdoor clothing company they

299
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:50,769
have started a new offshoot company new

300
00:11:48,549 --> 00:11:53,229
branch called Patagonia provisions or

301
00:11:50,769 --> 00:11:55,058
eight that uses the same kind of model

302
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:56,949
that they used with their clothing

303
00:11:55,058 --> 00:11:59,649
company where the clothing should be

304
00:11:56,948 --> 00:12:02,349
produced sustainably to start looking at

305
00:11:59,649 --> 00:12:03,789
food and so I think the original plan

306
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:06,339
was that they were going to develop a

307
00:12:03,789 --> 00:12:09,338
granola bar but they went with beer

308
00:12:06,339 --> 00:12:11,980
instead all right and so this is long

309
00:12:09,339 --> 00:12:14,680
route ale I actually have a can of this

310
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:18,188
stuff so Eugene was was kind enough to

311
00:12:14,679 --> 00:12:20,979
acquire some of this beer which was

312
00:12:18,188 --> 00:12:22,899
quite tasty because when we tried it but

313
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:24,490
this is really exciting again because

314
00:12:22,899 --> 00:12:26,169
people have always talked about this for

315
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:27,850
the past twenty thirty years people have

316
00:12:26,169 --> 00:12:29,948
talked about perennial greens but there

317
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:32,439
was no no commercial production of it

318
00:12:29,948 --> 00:12:35,498
and that we have are now at this point

319
00:12:32,438 --> 00:12:36,879
is just really exciting one thing if you

320
00:12:35,499 --> 00:12:39,689
look at the fine print it says free

321
00:12:36,879 --> 00:12:42,039
ground shipping on orders over $75

322
00:12:39,688 --> 00:12:46,360
unfortunately we can't get it shipped to

323
00:12:42,039 --> 00:12:47,919
New York State the U that doesn't apply

324
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:50,050
for the beer that's where the other

325
00:12:47,919 --> 00:12:51,519
products that they have okay so and just

326
00:12:50,049 --> 00:12:54,998
in case anybody was interested in

327
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:57,100
ordering some long route al another

328
00:12:54,999 --> 00:13:01,720
exciting thing happening with Kearns ax

329
00:12:57,100 --> 00:13:04,480
is that there was recently a a proposal

330
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:05,470
developed and this is the front cover of

331
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:09,999
this proposal

332
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:12,910
and this was for General Mills the food

333
00:13:09,999 --> 00:13:14,740
company the folks at the land Institute

334
00:13:12,909 --> 00:13:19,318
have been in contact with General Mills

335
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:22,480
and they have had requested a proposal

336
00:13:19,318 --> 00:13:25,568
to support research on Kearns ax and

337
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:26,620
what they're trying to do here is to go

338
00:13:25,568 --> 00:13:28,839
back up the supply

339
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:30,210
Chane to try to find ways that they can

340
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:32,800
meet their sustainability objectives

341
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:35,440
this is very similar to the work that

342
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:37,719
dr. Van Ness Harrell Dennis is doing

343
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:39,190
with Walmart and using adapt 10 so

344
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:41,290
they're going up the supply chain to try

345
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:43,570
to figure out how to increase the

346
00:13:41,289 --> 00:13:45,699
sustainability of their operation of

347
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:47,290
their corporation all right and so

348
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:51,240
General Mills aims to reduce greenhouse

349
00:13:47,289 --> 00:13:54,069
gas emissions by 28 percent by 2025 and

350
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:57,279
and so in order to achieve that goal

351
00:13:54,070 --> 00:14:02,350
they're looking to utilize 18 million

352
00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:04,419
pounds of turns ax annually by 2025 ok

353
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:05,560
so this proposal was developed and what

354
00:14:04,419 --> 00:14:08,439
they're calling for here is the

355
00:14:05,559 --> 00:14:10,989
development of the Kearns Development

356
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:13,510
Consortium all right and I really like

357
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:15,639
this last part here that's funded by an

358
00:14:13,509 --> 00:14:18,100
aggressive an aggressive investment in

359
00:14:15,639 --> 00:14:20,799
research over the next 15 years so I am

360
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:22,540
on this this I'm part of this Kearns of

361
00:14:20,799 --> 00:14:23,649
development consortium I'm really

362
00:14:22,539 --> 00:14:25,689
excited to see this moving forward

363
00:14:23,649 --> 00:14:28,059
hopefully we'll be doing a lot more

364
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:32,890
research on terms of in the near future

365
00:14:28,059 --> 00:14:35,049
with help from General Mills so again

366
00:14:32,889 --> 00:14:36,309
the ecosystem services that we're

367
00:14:35,049 --> 00:14:37,870
talking about with perennial grains

368
00:14:36,309 --> 00:14:41,259
we're talking about providing both food

369
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:43,740
and and potentially forage it's not

370
00:14:41,259 --> 00:14:46,929
listed there but carbon sequestration

371
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:48,909
habitat for wildlife and when we're

372
00:14:46,929 --> 00:14:51,069
growing these crops as opposed to annual

373
00:14:48,909 --> 00:14:53,379
crops we can reduce tillage reduce our

374
00:14:51,070 --> 00:14:54,790
soil erosion and reduce pollution from

375
00:14:53,379 --> 00:14:58,179
the inputs that we're using to grow

376
00:14:54,789 --> 00:15:00,279
these crops so I wanted to highlight

377
00:14:58,179 --> 00:15:03,939
some of the past work by Steve Coleman

378
00:15:00,279 --> 00:15:06,309
so this these plots are out at KBS this

379
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:07,600
was back a number of years ago I think

380
00:15:06,309 --> 00:15:10,329
in 2012

381
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:14,379
maybe 2011 but Steve invited me out to

382
00:15:10,330 --> 00:15:16,270
kbs2 as for part of this perennial

383
00:15:14,379 --> 00:15:19,330
grains meeting and we got the tour some

384
00:15:16,269 --> 00:15:21,309
of his plots and what they found in this

385
00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:23,290
research was that currency yields were

386
00:15:21,309 --> 00:15:25,419
quite low oh great currency is the

387
00:15:23,289 --> 00:15:27,309
perennial plant in the back this is

388
00:15:25,419 --> 00:15:29,229
annual wheat in the middle here and then

389
00:15:27,309 --> 00:15:30,969
this is perennial wheat so the perennial

390
00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:34,529
wheat here this is the cross this is

391
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:36,970
crossing the the annual crop with the

392
00:15:34,529 --> 00:15:39,250
perennial relative all right

393
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:39,670
turns on you know on the other hand is

394
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:42,820
the

395
00:15:39,669 --> 00:15:44,799
domesticated wild wild perennial okay

396
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:47,460
and so they saw that the yields were

397
00:15:44,799 --> 00:15:49,240
quite low all right with Kearns ax

398
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:50,980
especially in the first year they

399
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:53,230
planted a bit late all right

400
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:55,029
so an establishment year very low but

401
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:57,670
they got up to about a third of annual

402
00:15:55,029 --> 00:15:59,379
wheat in the second year all right they

403
00:15:57,669 --> 00:16:02,439
also found that currents of reduced

404
00:15:59,379 --> 00:16:04,679
nitrogen losses and and also had lower

405
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:07,810
moisture deeper in the soil profile

406
00:16:04,679 --> 00:16:09,429
there are not a summary results for

407
00:16:07,809 --> 00:16:11,500
perennial wheat because the perennial

408
00:16:09,429 --> 00:16:12,849
wheat did not fare so well although the

409
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:16,480
grain yields were higher in the first

410
00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:17,170
geo year all right it was not it did not

411
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,700
persist

412
00:16:17,169 --> 00:16:20,679
all right so died off so the Pernis

413
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:24,580
allottee all right is a really big issue

414
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:29,620
here with this one good yields but the

415
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:30,910
it did not survive okay so when we look

416
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:34,600
at some of these data we're looking at

417
00:16:30,909 --> 00:16:37,419
soil moisture alright in the profile so

418
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:40,180
this is 0 to 20 centimetres 20 to 40 40

419
00:16:37,419 --> 00:16:42,159
to 70 and 70 to 100 all right and what

420
00:16:40,179 --> 00:16:43,959
you're seeing here is that the perennial

421
00:16:42,159 --> 00:16:45,459
the perennial grain and this is in case

422
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:48,280
currants are compared to annual wheat

423
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:51,040
all right so it's drying out the the

424
00:16:48,279 --> 00:16:53,049
soil more so it's utilizing soil

425
00:16:51,039 --> 00:16:56,110
moisture to a greater degree than the

426
00:16:53,049 --> 00:16:59,250
annual annual wheat certainly in the

427
00:16:56,110 --> 00:17:02,259
year one over here 2010 and then in 2011

428
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:04,839
it's more pronounced in the as you go

429
00:17:02,259 --> 00:17:06,519
deeper in the soil profile okay so that

430
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:09,099
was so moist year here we're looking at

431
00:17:06,519 --> 00:17:10,839
at nitrate leaching alright so they

432
00:17:09,099 --> 00:17:13,929
installed my scimitar Zinn these plots

433
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:16,720
and they were looking at three different

434
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:20,740
types of nitrogen source so high

435
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:23,559
nitrogen a middle rate of 80 pounds of

436
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:25,660
nitrogen per acre as urea and then an

437
00:17:23,559 --> 00:17:28,240
organic source of nitrogen so another 80

438
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:30,009
pounds as poultry litter and what

439
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:32,890
they're seeing here again the perennial

440
00:17:30,009 --> 00:17:34,750
Grande turns a is the blue line alright

441
00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:37,240
and you're seeing virtually no leaching

442
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:40,390
alright so that current so those deep

443
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:42,099
roots alright you can see here they're

444
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:44,259
really sucking up that that nitrogen

445
00:17:42,099 --> 00:17:45,399
that nitrate and preventing it from

446
00:17:44,259 --> 00:17:47,259
leaching out so that's what we're

447
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:50,080
talking about reducing pollution

448
00:17:47,259 --> 00:17:52,029
associated with with these inputs that

449
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:53,449
we're using to grow our crops there's

450
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:56,149
also a lot of interest

451
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:58,400
in using perennial crops like Kern's ax

452
00:17:56,150 --> 00:18:00,380
to increase soil carbon sequestration

453
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:05,990
and as a tool for climate change

454
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:10,160
mitigation in our lab I've been working

455
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:12,920
on a review paper for the past year more

456
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:14,660
than a year I think but we're looking at

457
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:16,940
different cropping systems you know

458
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:19,580
specific cropping strategies for working

459
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:22,250
with perennial green crops one of those

460
00:18:19,579 --> 00:18:24,259
is using perennial rye which I'll talk

461
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:26,390
about in a second all right very similar

462
00:18:24,259 --> 00:18:28,789
to perennial wheat where it's a cross

463
00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:30,980
between the annual crop and the

464
00:18:28,789 --> 00:18:33,799
perennial relative intermediate wheat

465
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:36,829
grass combined with a perennial Legum

466
00:18:33,799 --> 00:18:38,240
forage and then and then this one here

467
00:18:36,829 --> 00:18:41,000
this highly diverse perennial grain

468
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:43,400
polyculture and so if we just start with

469
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,920
that one this is really what Wes Jackson

470
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:48,830
was thinking when he does a lot of his

471
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:50,990
talks about perennial grains and this is

472
00:18:48,829 --> 00:18:54,199
a with this strategy we're really trying

473
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:56,990
to mimic nature having all of these

474
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:59,180
different species growing together so

475
00:18:56,990 --> 00:19:01,880
this is supposed to simulate what we're

476
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:03,950
seeing in the prairies where you have

477
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:06,380
different species and they self-regulate

478
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:08,330
and you can imagine that you can have a

479
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:12,140
quite a bit of ecosystem services coming

480
00:19:08,329 --> 00:19:15,169
from a situation like this and so we are

481
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:17,180
not actively working on developing this

482
00:19:15,170 --> 00:19:19,550
type of system mainly because of the

483
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:21,680
complexity associated with it if we look

484
00:19:19,549 --> 00:19:24,440
at this this graphic here just this

485
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:26,180
example alright if we look at the number

486
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:28,700
of crop species that we're including in

487
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:30,560
a mixture or in a polyculture you can

488
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:32,420
imagine that the ecosystem services if

489
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:34,099
you follow this line here they increase

490
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:35,900
with the number of crop species that you

491
00:19:34,099 --> 00:19:38,719
have alright and then you hit an

492
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:41,960
asymptote but the management complexity

493
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:44,809
also increases and and we're not exactly

494
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:46,730
sure what these this relationship looks

495
00:19:44,809 --> 00:19:48,049
like in terms of management complexity

496
00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:49,759
it could be a lot different than that

497
00:19:48,049 --> 00:19:53,569
the shape of the curve that I just drew

498
00:19:49,759 --> 00:19:55,910
but we know it increases what we're

499
00:19:53,569 --> 00:19:58,339
thinking about is how can we do this how

500
00:19:55,910 --> 00:20:01,550
can we be smart about putting these

501
00:19:58,339 --> 00:20:03,439
species together so that we can increase

502
00:20:01,549 --> 00:20:05,960
our ecosystem services actually achieve

503
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:07,259
a higher level of ecosystem services all

504
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:09,480
right so we're here we're getting up

505
00:20:07,259 --> 00:20:11,579
nine all right we're over here we're

506
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:14,400
only getting up to seven and then also

507
00:20:11,579 --> 00:20:16,710
change change and make sure that we're

508
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:18,420
being strategic about our species that

509
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:21,500
were including so that the management

510
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:24,330
complexity is also reduced all right so

511
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:27,329
if you are strategic about it we think

512
00:20:24,329 --> 00:20:28,980
that there is potential here but again

513
00:20:27,329 --> 00:20:30,359
the the main concern here is with this

514
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:32,910
management complexity and just being

515
00:20:30,359 --> 00:20:34,429
able to grow these crops together in a

516
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:37,259
meaningful way

517
00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:38,700
what does seem like we can get some

518
00:20:37,259 --> 00:20:42,079
traction with is with perennial rye

519
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:44,340
we're looking at this crop as part of a

520
00:20:42,079 --> 00:20:47,460
at least thinking about it as part of a

521
00:20:44,339 --> 00:20:49,259
rotation where we would have it in in a

522
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:51,809
rotation with annual crops where we can

523
00:20:49,259 --> 00:20:53,910
increase the soil soil health over

524
00:20:51,809 --> 00:20:55,409
several years and then rotate back to

525
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:57,450
annual crops to take advantage of that

526
00:20:55,410 --> 00:20:59,220
increased soil health so again I already

527
00:20:57,450 --> 00:21:01,650
talked a little bit about this being

528
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:04,650
across these these yields have been a

529
00:21:01,650 --> 00:21:07,070
bit higher than then-current own at

530
00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:10,470
least in the past with previous research

531
00:21:07,069 --> 00:21:13,200
but there is some problems and so with

532
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:16,230
the title of the the presentation the

533
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:17,910
the promises the problems and the

534
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:19,860
progress I really want you to focus on

535
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:20,940
the progress of course but there are

536
00:21:19,859 --> 00:21:22,529
some problems that we need to

537
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:25,200
acknowledge this is one of the problems

538
00:21:22,529 --> 00:21:27,960
with our gate or gate is a fungal

539
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:31,259
disease and it can be pretty pretty bad

540
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:34,170
in terms of the impact health impacts

541
00:21:31,259 --> 00:21:36,210
it's causes a create psychoactive

542
00:21:34,170 --> 00:21:38,160
compounds so that's something that we

543
00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:39,630
really want to avoid when I first

544
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:41,580
started thinking about perennial rye I

545
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:43,830
thought we could use this for distilling

546
00:21:41,579 --> 00:21:46,769
to support the distilling industry

547
00:21:43,829 --> 00:21:48,329
around here but it turns out that forget

548
00:21:46,769 --> 00:21:50,039
the alkaloids will actually go through

549
00:21:48,329 --> 00:21:53,279
the distilling process and so that

550
00:21:50,039 --> 00:21:55,139
really isn't going to be a viable way to

551
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:57,629
deal with it so we're looking at color

552
00:21:55,140 --> 00:22:03,330
separation for dealing with any organs

553
00:21:57,630 --> 00:22:06,210
that we have with perennial rye so this

554
00:22:03,329 --> 00:22:07,439
this option this of including

555
00:22:06,210 --> 00:22:09,390
intermediate wheatgrass with the

556
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,890
perennial forage this does seem like one

557
00:22:09,390 --> 00:22:12,450
of the most tractable ways to move

558
00:22:10,890 --> 00:22:14,880
forward there's been a lot of progress

559
00:22:12,450 --> 00:22:16,529
with this we're interested in combining

560
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:19,650
these two different types of crops

561
00:22:16,529 --> 00:22:22,079
because of the ability of the legume to

562
00:22:19,650 --> 00:22:24,480
supply nitrogen to the

563
00:22:22,079 --> 00:22:27,599
and and also increase the Ford's quality

564
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:30,509
if we're thinking about dual purpose use

565
00:22:27,599 --> 00:22:32,490
of turns off harvesting in both for

566
00:22:30,509 --> 00:22:34,529
grain and for forage having a legging

567
00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:38,400
forage in there would certainly be nice

568
00:22:34,529 --> 00:22:39,839
so when you are intercropping one of the

569
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:43,350
challenges especially when you're

570
00:22:39,839 --> 00:22:45,569
dealing with perennials is the managing

571
00:22:43,349 --> 00:22:47,639
competition so depending on the time of

572
00:22:45,569 --> 00:22:49,649
establishment if you're planting them at

573
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:52,560
the same time or if you're trying to put

574
00:22:49,650 --> 00:22:54,600
in the legging later you can have one

575
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:56,970
species easily out-compete the other and

576
00:22:54,599 --> 00:22:59,549
so we're taking an active look at that

577
00:22:56,970 --> 00:23:03,210
we have a new experiment that Eugene

578
00:22:59,549 --> 00:23:06,000
Eugene law will be helping with managing

579
00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:09,319
in the future this was just established

580
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:11,849
this past summer and so this is

581
00:23:09,319 --> 00:23:14,819
comparing two annual grains to two

582
00:23:11,849 --> 00:23:17,549
perennial greens and and all of them

583
00:23:14,819 --> 00:23:19,139
have this split split plot with with red

584
00:23:17,549 --> 00:23:20,940
clover so with and without red clover

585
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:22,680
and so this will be a three-year

586
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:24,960
experiment where the annuals are are

587
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:27,150
repeatedly planted so kind of a worst

588
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:28,680
case scenario to really look at what

589
00:23:27,150 --> 00:23:31,410
happens if you do something that you're

590
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:35,279
not supposed to do but comparing that to

591
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:38,580
these perennial grains here okay so our

592
00:23:35,279 --> 00:23:40,319
hypotheses are that soil health and soil

593
00:23:38,579 --> 00:23:41,879
health will be greater and pests will be

594
00:23:40,319 --> 00:23:44,970
lower in plots with perennial grains

595
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:47,070
compared to plots with annual grains and

596
00:23:44,970 --> 00:23:51,240
that red clover will increase grain

597
00:23:47,069 --> 00:23:54,210
yields and overall profitability okay so

598
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:56,460
in terms of our measurements we're

599
00:23:54,210 --> 00:23:59,579
looking at crops crop performance

600
00:23:56,460 --> 00:24:02,400
indicators biomass grain yield and also

601
00:23:59,579 --> 00:24:04,500
pests grain quality soil health

602
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,550
indicators and soil erosion that's

603
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:09,180
another factor that we're really

604
00:24:05,549 --> 00:24:11,789
interested in this is what the plots the

605
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:16,170
plants look like 28 days after planting

606
00:24:11,789 --> 00:24:19,440
so turns ax over here and then the

607
00:24:16,170 --> 00:24:20,940
perennial rye all right these

608
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:23,820
photographs aren't the best but this is

609
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:26,430
55 days after planting and you can see

610
00:24:23,819 --> 00:24:28,799
the differences here so the kearns of

611
00:24:26,430 --> 00:24:30,330
plots all right there is some green in

612
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:32,339
there it looks like a lot of soil right

613
00:24:30,329 --> 00:24:34,349
now about being a perennial this crop is

614
00:24:32,339 --> 00:24:38,099
just much much slower than the

615
00:24:34,349 --> 00:24:40,168
annuals over here okay we came up with

616
00:24:38,099 --> 00:24:41,788
these varieties by working with some

617
00:24:40,169 --> 00:24:43,950
local farmers that we're collaborating

618
00:24:41,788 --> 00:24:46,679
with and so these are popular varieties

619
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:49,169
with them and so hopefully they'll be

620
00:24:46,679 --> 00:24:50,669
interested in our results and then this

621
00:24:49,169 --> 00:24:52,110
is what the perennial ride looks like a

622
00:24:50,669 --> 00:24:54,330
little bit better than the Kern zone but

623
00:24:52,109 --> 00:24:58,139
not quite as good as those annual annual

624
00:24:54,329 --> 00:24:59,220
small grains so that was a new

625
00:24:58,140 --> 00:25:00,630
experiment I'm going to tell you about

626
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:02,880
an experiment that we have been working

627
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:05,429
on over the past two years and

628
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:07,590
established it was established in 2014

629
00:25:05,429 --> 00:25:09,929
and this is with Steve Coleman this

630
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:11,548
dual-purpose Kern's experiment and this

631
00:25:09,929 --> 00:25:13,380
is really one of the reasons why we're

632
00:25:11,548 --> 00:25:15,089
interested in in conducting the

633
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:18,030
experiment with Eugene looking at

634
00:25:15,089 --> 00:25:20,129
combining the red clover with the

635
00:25:18,029 --> 00:25:23,609
currants off and that is because we're

636
00:25:20,130 --> 00:25:25,710
thinking that ferns a-- can be used for

637
00:25:23,609 --> 00:25:29,219
not only grain but also for forage

638
00:25:25,710 --> 00:25:32,579
production and so the grain yields have

639
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:35,700
traditionally been very low okay we see

640
00:25:32,579 --> 00:25:37,980
that the grain yields typically peak at

641
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:41,429
years one and two all right and then

642
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:44,788
they decline they decline because of the

643
00:25:41,429 --> 00:25:48,298
plant being sod bound okay so it's a

644
00:25:44,788 --> 00:25:51,150
this planet is highly prized amitis and

645
00:25:48,298 --> 00:25:53,730
then it forms a sod and this sod that

646
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:58,169
limits really the the reproductive

647
00:25:53,730 --> 00:25:59,400
tiller tillering density and and could

648
00:25:58,169 --> 00:26:02,460
be very problematic in terms of

649
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:04,259
maintaining grain yield alright steve

650
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:07,110
has done some work looking at fertilizer

651
00:26:04,259 --> 00:26:10,048
applications and so currency does

652
00:26:07,109 --> 00:26:12,779
respond to nitrogen but like many small

653
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:16,288
grains if you apply too much it can fall

654
00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:21,569
over and result in logic so that's one

655
00:26:16,288 --> 00:26:23,158
of those issues and there are goals in

656
00:26:21,569 --> 00:26:25,048
the objective you know the questions

657
00:26:23,159 --> 00:26:26,789
that we're asking is can we offset the

658
00:26:25,048 --> 00:26:28,950
low grain production with added value of

659
00:26:26,788 --> 00:26:31,440
forage alright and so we're trying to

660
00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:32,909
look at both green and forge yields over

661
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:36,390
a range of different environments and

662
00:26:32,909 --> 00:26:39,120
then how can we mitigate the declining

663
00:26:36,390 --> 00:26:41,460
grain yields over time and so what is

664
00:26:39,119 --> 00:26:46,619
the effect of defoliation on grain

665
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:48,240
yields okay so these slides or some of

666
00:26:46,619 --> 00:26:51,389
this information was recently presented

667
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:52,950
at the try society meeting and so these

668
00:26:51,390 --> 00:26:55,590
are the different locations where this

669
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:58,799
research is being conducted so we're

670
00:26:55,589 --> 00:27:01,409
your number number five here at Cornell

671
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:03,629
but you can see we're all over all over

672
00:27:01,410 --> 00:27:06,120
the US so Colorado Kansas Maryland

673
00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:10,320
Minnesota New York Ohio Iowa Wisconsin

674
00:27:06,119 --> 00:27:12,239
South Dakota and even in Canada okay I

675
00:27:10,319 --> 00:27:14,369
just wanted to make a note that there

676
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:16,349
are 30 percent of the people here are

677
00:27:14,369 --> 00:27:19,439
from Cornell they've come through

678
00:27:16,349 --> 00:27:21,959
Cornell program so there's certainly a

679
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:23,430
Cornell connection with these different

680
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:25,769
researchers I think that's perpetuated

681
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:29,970
by Steve Coleman just knowing these

682
00:27:25,769 --> 00:27:31,710
folks but interesting nonetheless and so

683
00:27:29,970 --> 00:27:32,850
with these different treatments in this

684
00:27:31,710 --> 00:27:35,400
experiment there are four different

685
00:27:32,849 --> 00:27:36,839
treatments there's a control this green

686
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:39,600
treatment where we're just harvesting

687
00:27:36,839 --> 00:27:42,899
the grain there's a forage and grain and

688
00:27:39,599 --> 00:27:44,069
then a fall cut okay as we go through

689
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:45,780
this I really just want you to pay

690
00:27:44,069 --> 00:27:47,759
attention to these two the grain and

691
00:27:45,779 --> 00:27:49,769
then the forage and grain so this is

692
00:27:47,759 --> 00:27:52,289
standard basically the standard practice

693
00:27:49,769 --> 00:27:55,200
all right and then this is trying to get

694
00:27:52,289 --> 00:27:57,170
some forage from these plots in the

695
00:27:55,200 --> 00:28:00,720
spring and then harvesting for grain

696
00:27:57,170 --> 00:28:04,800
okay we also had some nitrogen

697
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:05,569
treatments using urea applying at two

698
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:08,299
different rates

699
00:28:05,569 --> 00:28:10,859
all right using a split application and

700
00:28:08,299 --> 00:28:13,079
so I have some photographs for you so

701
00:28:10,859 --> 00:28:17,009
this is the spring growth this is in

702
00:28:13,079 --> 00:28:20,419
2015 so it was planted and in August of

703
00:28:17,009 --> 00:28:24,420
2014 so this is over wintered in May

704
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:25,980
this is harvesting with the very old

705
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:26,750
Carter harvest area so this is Brian

706
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:28,860
Caldwell

707
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:32,609
one of the folks that's in my lab

708
00:28:28,859 --> 00:28:33,899
harvesting on May 22nd you can see what

709
00:28:32,609 --> 00:28:37,799
the plots look like after they were

710
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:41,600
harvested all right cut to a height of

711
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:44,700
four inches one of the problems that we

712
00:28:41,599 --> 00:28:46,529
that we had with starting off this

713
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:48,450
experiment was that we went into a field

714
00:28:46,529 --> 00:28:52,230
that had previously been planted to

715
00:28:48,450 --> 00:28:54,240
annual wheat and so I was thinking that

716
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:57,120
this was a good idea the field was open

717
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:59,490
no big deal and it turns out that there

718
00:28:57,119 --> 00:29:01,500
was a lot of a lot of contamination a

719
00:28:59,490 --> 00:29:05,370
lot of the annual wheat

720
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:07,529
Daten wasn't collected in the combining

721
00:29:05,369 --> 00:29:10,619
process it was distributed across the

722
00:29:07,529 --> 00:29:12,539
field and so there were a lot of annual

723
00:29:10,619 --> 00:29:16,409
wheat heads mixed in with the Kern's uh

724
00:29:12,539 --> 00:29:20,730
at least during the first year okay and

725
00:29:16,410 --> 00:29:23,930
for were the research plots we had a

726
00:29:20,730 --> 00:29:25,799
quite an amazing crew of undergraduates

727
00:29:23,930 --> 00:29:28,230
undergraduate research assistants who

728
00:29:25,799 --> 00:29:30,750
went out and and hand-picked a lot of

729
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:33,480
the the annual wheat heads and I I think

730
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:36,089
they they almost killed me for that but

731
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:39,720
uh but it helped clean things up quite a

732
00:29:36,089 --> 00:29:43,980
bit this is a picture of our pot combine

733
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:46,350
going through the research pot another

734
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:48,150
challenge that we had with with this

735
00:29:46,349 --> 00:29:51,269
crop was harvesting it was direct

736
00:29:48,150 --> 00:29:53,130
combining with the with the research

737
00:29:51,269 --> 00:29:55,680
plot combine we did have a lot of

738
00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:57,810
clogging a lot of the material wasn't

739
00:29:55,680 --> 00:30:00,480
completely dry the thing is with

740
00:29:57,809 --> 00:30:03,480
perennial grains so they're drawing from

741
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:06,690
the top down right an annual grain will

742
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:08,460
dry from the bottom up okay and so we

743
00:30:06,690 --> 00:30:09,960
need to dry you know you don't have to

744
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:12,029
deal with wet material you can go

745
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:14,309
through with your combine you have the

746
00:30:12,029 --> 00:30:16,139
cutter bar it cuts everything passes

747
00:30:14,309 --> 00:30:18,450
through the combine without any problems

748
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:21,540
here the lower you go the greener it

749
00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:24,900
gets okay and so that was a bit of an

750
00:30:21,539 --> 00:30:27,299
issue for us and so I think we learned a

751
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:30,480
lot over the past couple of years this

752
00:30:27,299 --> 00:30:33,480
was using the the farm combine that has

753
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:36,720
an air rail up in front and this was a

754
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:38,579
lot easier to use just have a greater

755
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:42,720
capacity to get the material through the

756
00:30:38,579 --> 00:30:44,730
combine it was fairly dirty our first

757
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:46,500
harvest we had a lot of a lot of extra

758
00:30:44,730 --> 00:30:49,980
material in there we had a lot of annual

759
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:52,619
wheat despite the hand weeding and so we

760
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:55,950
weren't all that all that thrilled about

761
00:30:52,619 --> 00:30:59,099
our first harvest but it's certainly

762
00:30:55,950 --> 00:31:01,860
exciting to see and here are some of the

763
00:30:59,099 --> 00:31:04,339
the plots that had nitrogen applied to

764
00:31:01,859 --> 00:31:07,589
them you can see the extra green I was

765
00:31:04,339 --> 00:31:10,799
and you see here this is where the urea

766
00:31:07,589 --> 00:31:11,970
was applied and we didn't have a whole

767
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:14,849
lot of

768
00:31:11,970 --> 00:31:18,240
impacts on the on the grain we did see

769
00:31:14,849 --> 00:31:21,329
greater forage biomass production from

770
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:25,339
the nitrogen at least in the fall but no

771
00:31:21,329 --> 00:31:28,798
effect on the grain yield here the plots

772
00:31:25,339 --> 00:31:29,839
post an thesis in July this past year in

773
00:31:28,798 --> 00:31:33,329
2016

774
00:31:29,839 --> 00:31:35,759
ok and now I'm going to show you grain

775
00:31:33,329 --> 00:31:38,699
yields across all nine sites so these

776
00:31:35,759 --> 00:31:42,000
are just box plots going from Colorado

777
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:46,350
all the way on left to Wisconsin here in

778
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:48,388
the two years ok so average across all

779
00:31:46,349 --> 00:31:52,439
the sites grain yields were a bit higher

780
00:31:48,388 --> 00:31:56,699
in 2015 compared to 2016 but overall

781
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:58,620
very low ok and so I encourage you not

782
00:31:56,700 --> 00:32:00,929
to think about this in comparison to

783
00:31:58,619 --> 00:32:03,028
annual grains because that'll just maybe

784
00:32:00,929 --> 00:32:04,620
be a little depressing but but this is

785
00:32:03,028 --> 00:32:06,329
exciting we are getting grain off of

786
00:32:04,619 --> 00:32:08,548
these perennial plants ok and I think

787
00:32:06,329 --> 00:32:12,359
that's the main takeaway point here ok

788
00:32:08,548 --> 00:32:15,509
it's a low yield but it's something ok

789
00:32:12,359 --> 00:32:18,000
so if we're looking at just New York

790
00:32:15,509 --> 00:32:19,378
alright so here are the two treatments

791
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,269
that I ask you to pay attention to in

792
00:32:19,378 --> 00:32:24,148
the two different years alright and so

793
00:32:21,269 --> 00:32:27,000
we're looking at basically the the

794
00:32:24,148 --> 00:32:30,089
biomass alright so this is the straw

795
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:32,909
okay this is the the forage at the time

796
00:32:30,089 --> 00:32:34,829
of grain harvest okay

797
00:32:32,909 --> 00:32:37,139
these plots over here they had this

798
00:32:34,829 --> 00:32:39,089
spring cut so this is where we went in

799
00:32:37,138 --> 00:32:41,788
when it was still very green and we

800
00:32:39,089 --> 00:32:43,918
harvested these plots for forage ok and

801
00:32:41,788 --> 00:32:45,960
then we went back and we harvested them

802
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:48,690
for grain and then this is the straw

803
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:52,048
yield associated with that grain harvest

804
00:32:48,690 --> 00:32:54,210
okay so no no real difference overall in

805
00:32:52,048 --> 00:32:56,788
terms of overall biomass production but

806
00:32:54,210 --> 00:32:59,308
this alright this is quite a bit

807
00:32:56,788 --> 00:33:02,220
different material than this here ok

808
00:32:59,308 --> 00:33:04,079
when we look at the forage quality of

809
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:06,600
the spring cut so the green material

810
00:33:04,079 --> 00:33:08,158
compared to the summer cut we see that

811
00:33:06,599 --> 00:33:11,490
there are some pretty big differences

812
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:13,500
this is just some an example of what

813
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:17,519
we're shooting for with our forage

814
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:20,579
quality metrics here so crude protein in

815
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:23,308
this case it was higher associated with

816
00:33:20,579 --> 00:33:24,599
the with the straw okay if you think

817
00:33:23,308 --> 00:33:25,799
about it there's probably some grain

818
00:33:24,599 --> 00:33:28,019
that's going into this

819
00:33:25,799 --> 00:33:31,409
and that's driving up that that that

820
00:33:28,019 --> 00:33:34,170
straw protein value at the summer cut

821
00:33:31,410 --> 00:33:36,360
okay but everything else okay so if we

822
00:33:34,170 --> 00:33:38,519
look at the relative feed value okay so

823
00:33:36,359 --> 00:33:41,490
a good relative feed value is above 150

824
00:33:38,519 --> 00:33:44,879
so we're up to a 214 with that early cut

825
00:33:41,490 --> 00:33:46,799
okay and so we're really excited about

826
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:50,760
these results we see that that Kearns a

827
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:52,500
can make some very nice forage and the

828
00:33:50,759 --> 00:33:55,410
next question is well does that forage

829
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:58,289
clip really impact the grain yield okay

830
00:33:55,410 --> 00:34:01,050
and so although not statistically

831
00:33:58,289 --> 00:34:04,769
different our first year we did see that

832
00:34:01,049 --> 00:34:07,829
the the forage harvest didn't we did see

833
00:34:04,769 --> 00:34:09,179
a numerically lower yield than just

834
00:34:07,829 --> 00:34:12,449
harvesting the grain alone

835
00:34:09,179 --> 00:34:15,539
okay but overall it wasn't all that

836
00:34:12,449 --> 00:34:17,579
consistent here we did see that same

837
00:34:15,539 --> 00:34:20,039
negative effect when we take the forage

838
00:34:17,579 --> 00:34:24,148
we did have a lower grain yield but in

839
00:34:20,039 --> 00:34:27,320
the other cases again no no impact okay

840
00:34:24,148 --> 00:34:31,889
and these are not all the same set years

841
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:33,630
some of the other sites did not did not

842
00:34:31,889 --> 00:34:35,639
have this exact treatment or did not

843
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:37,648
manage it the same way so just as this

844
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:41,339
is a just a reduced set of those

845
00:34:37,648 --> 00:34:43,409
different sites so in terms of the dual

846
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:45,870
purpose current experiment so yields

847
00:34:43,409 --> 00:34:47,220
varied widely we saw that in terms of

848
00:34:45,869 --> 00:34:48,599
the control treatment we didn't talk a

849
00:34:47,219 --> 00:34:50,189
lot about the control treatment but

850
00:34:48,599 --> 00:34:52,349
that's basically just harvesting the

851
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:54,929
green versus going in and taking out the

852
00:34:52,349 --> 00:34:58,049
straw when we take out the straw we see

853
00:34:54,929 --> 00:34:59,460
some higher yields alright and so what I

854
00:34:58,050 --> 00:35:01,140
think is actually happening there is

855
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:02,550
when you mow those pots after you

856
00:35:01,139 --> 00:35:04,650
harvest you're actually getting some

857
00:35:02,550 --> 00:35:06,060
weed control associated with that we did

858
00:35:04,650 --> 00:35:08,579
have some perennial weeds that crept

859
00:35:06,059 --> 00:35:10,199
into the pot and so reducing that

860
00:35:08,579 --> 00:35:12,239
biomass that's standing biomass was

861
00:35:10,199 --> 00:35:14,639
beneficial alright

862
00:35:12,239 --> 00:35:17,789
spring clipping reduced plant height and

863
00:35:14,639 --> 00:35:19,500
so in terms of the lodging problem we

864
00:35:17,789 --> 00:35:21,119
think that that can help especially if

865
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:23,789
we are going to be adding nitrogen to

866
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:25,679
try to increase our crop yields and so

867
00:35:23,789 --> 00:35:27,869
so we're really excited about this

868
00:35:25,679 --> 00:35:29,099
experiment it's continuing I want to

869
00:35:27,869 --> 00:35:30,329
shift gears a little bit and tell you

870
00:35:29,099 --> 00:35:33,659
about some other research that we've

871
00:35:30,329 --> 00:35:35,840
done in the lab we conducted a survey of

872
00:35:33,659 --> 00:35:38,460
farmers so we wanted to really know

873
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:39,269
what's going on with farmers have they

874
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:41,490
heard about perennial

875
00:35:39,269 --> 00:35:43,530
Graeme's before are they interested in

876
00:35:41,489 --> 00:35:46,019
potentially growing perennial brains and

877
00:35:43,530 --> 00:35:47,940
so this was a survey of farmers and also

878
00:35:46,019 --> 00:35:50,219
processors we're still working on

879
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:52,769
analyzing the processor data set but we

880
00:35:50,219 --> 00:35:55,529
want to gauge interest and this was

881
00:35:52,769 --> 00:35:56,909
conducted in France and in the u.s. so

882
00:35:55,530 --> 00:36:00,660
we have some collaborators christophe

883
00:35:56,909 --> 00:36:04,139
david at is there a lyon and this was

884
00:36:00,659 --> 00:36:06,449
Valentin's project over the summer ok so

885
00:36:04,139 --> 00:36:08,400
we had a fairly decent response rate so

886
00:36:06,449 --> 00:36:11,189
over four hundred farmers responded to

887
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:12,480
this survey so a lot more in France I

888
00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:14,369
think we could have probably done a

889
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:17,639
better job getting the word out in the

890
00:36:14,369 --> 00:36:19,319
US but we had a decent response rate or

891
00:36:17,639 --> 00:36:21,809
a decent response anyway we used

892
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:23,250
snowball sampling so we can't actually

893
00:36:21,809 --> 00:36:24,299
calculate a response rate because we

894
00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:26,550
don't know how many people saw the

895
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:29,760
survey link but we were happy to get

896
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:32,039
this many people responding and so I

897
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:34,500
want to show you a couple of the results

898
00:36:32,039 --> 00:36:36,539
from this this survey here we're looking

899
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:39,000
at motivations for growing perennial

900
00:36:36,539 --> 00:36:41,009
grains okay and so the number one

901
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:43,889
motivation and we have it broken out by

902
00:36:41,010 --> 00:36:45,660
organic and conventional farmers so we

903
00:36:43,889 --> 00:36:47,460
looked at the demographics of the the

904
00:36:45,659 --> 00:36:49,500
pool of respondents and we saw that

905
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:50,909
there was a nice split between organic

906
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:52,800
and conventional and that was somewhat

907
00:36:50,909 --> 00:36:56,190
intentional we wanted to have a lot of

908
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:58,380
organic farmers so we see that this this

909
00:36:56,190 --> 00:36:59,820
first one here increasing our

910
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:01,440
maintaining farm profitability so that's

911
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:03,180
the number one reason why farmers would

912
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:04,950
be interested in growing perennial

913
00:37:03,179 --> 00:37:06,960
grains and that sort of makes sense this

914
00:37:04,949 --> 00:37:08,730
was significantly different more

915
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:11,119
conventional farmers and organic farmers

916
00:37:08,730 --> 00:37:14,940
we're interested in that that factor

917
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:16,619
reducing inputs ok so conventional

918
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:18,590
farmers again want to try to reduce

919
00:37:16,619 --> 00:37:21,150
their inputs using this perennial grain

920
00:37:18,590 --> 00:37:22,650
compared to an annual grain reducing

921
00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:24,420
labor so this is where the organic

922
00:37:22,650 --> 00:37:26,190
farmers you know we're more interested

923
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:29,070
in reducing labor than the conventional

924
00:37:26,190 --> 00:37:32,039
farmers ok the other thing that we see

925
00:37:29,070 --> 00:37:34,260
here diversifying crop production again

926
00:37:32,039 --> 00:37:35,969
a big difference between the organic and

927
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:37,350
conventional farmers with the organic

928
00:37:35,969 --> 00:37:40,289
farmers thinking that perennial greens

929
00:37:37,349 --> 00:37:42,630
can help them diversify ok forage

930
00:37:40,289 --> 00:37:45,119
alright more of the organic farmers that

931
00:37:42,630 --> 00:37:47,820
we surveyed grew forage crops and had

932
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:49,170
livestock so this made sense to us that

933
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:51,420
more the organic farmers would be

934
00:37:49,170 --> 00:37:53,039
interested in using perennial greens for

935
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:56,369
that dual purpose of both grain

936
00:37:53,039 --> 00:37:59,729
and forge we also asked about concerns

937
00:37:56,369 --> 00:38:03,028
so potential reasons why they might not

938
00:37:59,728 --> 00:38:04,858
grow perennial grains and so what we see

939
00:38:03,028 --> 00:38:07,168
here is increased pest problems

940
00:38:04,858 --> 00:38:10,409
so more organic farmers and conventional

941
00:38:07,168 --> 00:38:13,528
farmers both types of farmers we're

942
00:38:10,409 --> 00:38:17,399
interested in or concerned about the low

943
00:38:13,528 --> 00:38:20,219
grain yield high seed costs and and this

944
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:22,798
lack of market where you can sell your

945
00:38:20,219 --> 00:38:25,259
crop conventional farmers were more

946
00:38:22,798 --> 00:38:28,380
concerned about low profitability okay I

947
00:38:25,259 --> 00:38:29,938
thought this was interesting that you

948
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:30,838
know in terms of low grain yield and low

949
00:38:29,938 --> 00:38:32,129
profitability

950
00:38:30,838 --> 00:38:33,389
you know the organic farmers they

951
00:38:32,130 --> 00:38:36,719
weren't as concerned about low

952
00:38:33,389 --> 00:38:40,199
profitability than as the conventional

953
00:38:36,719 --> 00:38:44,400
farmers so I think we'll just stop there

954
00:38:40,199 --> 00:38:46,469
with that survey graph we also had some

955
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:48,269
targeted questions okay

956
00:38:46,469 --> 00:38:49,769
so there's some very specific questions

957
00:38:48,268 --> 00:38:52,468
that we want to get them to respond to

958
00:38:49,768 --> 00:38:55,558
and they were asked to agree or disagree

959
00:38:52,469 --> 00:38:57,838
with the statement so the first one is

960
00:38:55,559 --> 00:39:00,599
I'm interested in dual dual purpose

961
00:38:57,838 --> 00:39:02,130
perennial greens perennial crops that

962
00:39:00,599 --> 00:39:05,039
can be harvested for both green and

963
00:39:02,130 --> 00:39:06,568
forage so more organic farmers agreed

964
00:39:05,039 --> 00:39:10,409
with that statement than conventional

965
00:39:06,568 --> 00:39:12,119
farmers so 148 compared to only 36 and

966
00:39:10,409 --> 00:39:16,858
if you look at the percentage so about

967
00:39:12,119 --> 00:39:19,079
70% compared to about 50% okay so this

968
00:39:16,858 --> 00:39:20,369
this next statement I would grow

969
00:39:19,079 --> 00:39:23,068
perennial grains to provide

970
00:39:20,369 --> 00:39:25,459
environmental benefits even if they were

971
00:39:23,068 --> 00:39:28,708
not as profitable as other crops

972
00:39:25,458 --> 00:39:30,719
okay so again organic farmers tended to

973
00:39:28,708 --> 00:39:34,948
agree with that much more than

974
00:39:30,719 --> 00:39:37,108
conventional farmers okay the last one

975
00:39:34,949 --> 00:39:38,909
here is research funding should be spent

976
00:39:37,108 --> 00:39:41,088
on annual grain crops rather than

977
00:39:38,909 --> 00:39:44,939
developing new perennial green crops

978
00:39:41,088 --> 00:39:47,278
okay and I was pleased to see that there

979
00:39:44,938 --> 00:39:49,708
was a lot of disagreement with with that

980
00:39:47,278 --> 00:39:50,998
statement so again there was a

981
00:39:49,708 --> 00:39:52,858
difference between organic and

982
00:39:50,998 --> 00:39:55,259
conventional farmers here more of the

983
00:39:52,858 --> 00:39:57,478
organic farmers disagreed with that

984
00:39:55,259 --> 00:40:01,469
statement compared to the conventional

985
00:39:57,478 --> 00:40:04,078
farmers okay so we do see farmer

986
00:40:01,469 --> 00:40:06,059
interest in perennial greens and and

987
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:06,900
there's a lot more that can be done with

988
00:40:06,059 --> 00:40:08,460
that survey

989
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:11,639
this is being worked up right now and

990
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:13,949
should be submitted to a journal very

991
00:40:11,639 --> 00:40:17,759
soon I also wanted to tell you about a

992
00:40:13,949 --> 00:40:18,929
new grant and from northeast sare titled

993
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:20,730
developing perennial green cropping

994
00:40:18,929 --> 00:40:24,078
systems and market opportunities in the

995
00:40:20,730 --> 00:40:28,500
Northeast we have quite an ambitious

996
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:31,140
performance target with with this grant

997
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:32,909
proposal we said that 20 farmers will

998
00:40:31,139 --> 00:40:37,528
establish perennial greens on a total of

999
00:40:32,909 --> 00:40:40,170
400 acres ok reducing erosion and we

1000
00:40:37,528 --> 00:40:42,690
wanted to contribute to the sale of 150

1001
00:40:40,170 --> 00:40:46,079
tons of perennial greens all right in

1002
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:48,298
the Northeast so you know looking back

1003
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:50,430
at this I feel a little a little crazy

1004
00:40:48,298 --> 00:40:52,739
for thinking that we could do this but

1005
00:40:50,429 --> 00:40:55,048
I'm optimistic and the reason why I'm

1006
00:40:52,739 --> 00:40:57,750
optimistic is because of our of our team

1007
00:40:55,048 --> 00:40:59,278
ok we have an outstanding group of

1008
00:40:57,750 --> 00:41:02,130
organic farmers working on this project

1009
00:40:59,278 --> 00:41:04,318
and an outstanding project manager

1010
00:41:02,130 --> 00:41:06,318
Sondra Wayman alright and these people

1011
00:41:04,318 --> 00:41:09,028
are very committed to seeing this work

1012
00:41:06,318 --> 00:41:10,440
so we have some on-farm trials we have a

1013
00:41:09,028 --> 00:41:12,778
new experiment that musgrave the one I

1014
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:14,608
was telling you about with Eugene and so

1015
00:41:12,778 --> 00:41:17,068
we're going to be doing workshops we

1016
00:41:14,608 --> 00:41:19,619
have some tasting and a tasting event

1017
00:41:17,068 --> 00:41:22,108
that's lined up and then with bakers and

1018
00:41:19,619 --> 00:41:25,200
brewers and distillers and also a farm

1019
00:41:22,108 --> 00:41:27,119
on farm field day so these are our

1020
00:41:25,199 --> 00:41:29,548
farmers that are involved in this

1021
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:33,298
project looking at the plots over the

1022
00:41:29,548 --> 00:41:35,309
summer and so what we're going to be

1023
00:41:33,298 --> 00:41:37,710
doing is looking at turns ax and then

1024
00:41:35,309 --> 00:41:40,140
perennial rye all right these crops were

1025
00:41:37,710 --> 00:41:41,970
planted this past September and each of

1026
00:41:40,139 --> 00:41:43,259
the different farmers are taking on a

1027
00:41:41,969 --> 00:41:45,179
different research question

1028
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:47,130
so tour Austin area is looking at

1029
00:41:45,179 --> 00:41:49,949
different ways to harvest the material

1030
00:41:47,130 --> 00:41:53,250
the the grain John Mayer is looking at

1031
00:41:49,949 --> 00:41:55,348
spring fertility fertilizer rates and

1032
00:41:53,250 --> 00:41:57,139
then clost martins is looking at seeding

1033
00:41:55,349 --> 00:42:00,778
rates and so these questions were really

1034
00:41:57,139 --> 00:42:02,338
farmer generated which is really nice I

1035
00:42:00,778 --> 00:42:04,469
think they'll be more excited about the

1036
00:42:02,338 --> 00:42:06,568
results and then if we were just to

1037
00:42:04,469 --> 00:42:10,679
impose what we wanted to do on onto

1038
00:42:06,568 --> 00:42:13,139
their land and so this is Taurasi nur we

1039
00:42:10,679 --> 00:42:14,548
planted at his place on September 9 we

1040
00:42:13,139 --> 00:42:16,379
were very interested in working with tor

1041
00:42:14,548 --> 00:42:20,239
for a number of reasons but one of those

1042
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:23,298
reasons was that in June of 2015 he

1043
00:42:20,239 --> 00:42:26,059
incredible rain event at his at his farm

1044
00:42:23,298 --> 00:42:28,099
and so this was the wet year all right

1045
00:42:26,059 --> 00:42:30,019
he had five inches of rain in one hour

1046
00:42:28,099 --> 00:42:31,909
and washed away a lot of his soil so

1047
00:42:30,018 --> 00:42:33,438
he's an organic farmer and uses a lot of

1048
00:42:31,909 --> 00:42:35,719
tillage so he's really interested in

1049
00:42:33,438 --> 00:42:38,118
ways to reduce tillage and we're hopeful

1050
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:40,789
that we can integrate perennial grains

1051
00:42:38,119 --> 00:42:42,199
into his his operation in a way to help

1052
00:42:40,789 --> 00:42:44,209
him deal with some of that soil erosion

1053
00:42:42,199 --> 00:42:46,068
that he's experienced in the past he

1054
00:42:44,208 --> 00:42:47,719
stated in his letter of support that

1055
00:42:46,068 --> 00:42:50,088
West Jackson some of his writings

1056
00:42:47,719 --> 00:42:51,798
actually inspired him to transition from

1057
00:42:50,088 --> 00:42:53,358
conventional production to organic

1058
00:42:51,798 --> 00:42:55,728
production so that was really exciting

1059
00:42:53,358 --> 00:42:57,679
to see he has experienced harvesting

1060
00:42:55,728 --> 00:42:59,568
different crops you somewhat unique or

1061
00:42:57,679 --> 00:43:02,059
alternative crops for seeds so he

1062
00:42:59,568 --> 00:43:03,949
harvest buckwheat you know buckwheat is

1063
00:43:02,059 --> 00:43:05,419
a crop that he swapped so he cuts it and

1064
00:43:03,949 --> 00:43:07,249
then picks it up off the ground and puts

1065
00:43:05,418 --> 00:43:11,808
it through a combine and also red clover

1066
00:43:07,248 --> 00:43:14,808
for seed so he is also a part owner of a

1067
00:43:11,809 --> 00:43:16,759
flour mill and a bakery so we again he's

1068
00:43:14,809 --> 00:43:17,959
vertically integrated and we think that

1069
00:43:16,759 --> 00:43:20,989
there could be a lot of opportunities to

1070
00:43:17,958 --> 00:43:24,288
work with tor to see this market be

1071
00:43:20,989 --> 00:43:26,509
developed so these are the plants one

1072
00:43:24,289 --> 00:43:29,689
month after planting the Kern's ax looks

1073
00:43:26,509 --> 00:43:32,599
really weedy unfortunately but the

1074
00:43:29,688 --> 00:43:35,088
perennial rye looks it looks good all

1075
00:43:32,599 --> 00:43:37,399
right here's John Mayer so his plot his

1076
00:43:35,088 --> 00:43:39,679
plots were planted on September 15th

1077
00:43:37,398 --> 00:43:42,618
he's been a longtime collaborator with

1078
00:43:39,679 --> 00:43:44,568
Cornell so John Mayer really pays

1079
00:43:42,619 --> 00:43:47,509
attention we did some research with him

1080
00:43:44,568 --> 00:43:49,219
this past past summer and we did some

1081
00:43:47,509 --> 00:43:52,429
soil testing and some weed seed bank

1082
00:43:49,219 --> 00:43:56,418
sampling and we gave him some results

1083
00:43:52,429 --> 00:43:57,889
and and he called us out on an issue

1084
00:43:56,418 --> 00:43:59,778
that we had he said you know that

1085
00:43:57,889 --> 00:44:01,639
doesn't look right and we went back and

1086
00:43:59,778 --> 00:44:03,498
we checked in and he was right and so

1087
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:07,068
he's really engaged and he does pay

1088
00:44:03,498 --> 00:44:09,498
attention so excellent farmer he is also

1089
00:44:07,068 --> 00:44:12,708
the owner of a distillery all right

1090
00:44:09,498 --> 00:44:14,778
right along kuegel Lake on the knee on

1091
00:44:12,708 --> 00:44:17,108
the west side and so we're thinking that

1092
00:44:14,778 --> 00:44:19,489
we could work with him to really try

1093
00:44:17,108 --> 00:44:21,199
using some of these perennial greens for

1094
00:44:19,489 --> 00:44:23,228
distilling okay

1095
00:44:21,199 --> 00:44:25,759
these are what his our pots looked like

1096
00:44:23,228 --> 00:44:27,048
41 days after planting the perennial rye

1097
00:44:25,759 --> 00:44:30,048
looking a little bit better than the

1098
00:44:27,048 --> 00:44:32,028
current saw at this early stage and then

1099
00:44:30,048 --> 00:44:33,538
kloss Martin's so a lot of people know

1100
00:44:32,028 --> 00:44:35,759
class Martin's a

1101
00:44:33,539 --> 00:44:38,189
food company seed and food company

1102
00:44:35,759 --> 00:44:40,019
Lakeview organic grains and again a long

1103
00:44:38,188 --> 00:44:43,259
history of collaboration with with

1104
00:44:40,018 --> 00:44:45,298
Cornell University excellent farmer so

1105
00:44:43,259 --> 00:44:48,119
these are pictures of his plots

1106
00:44:45,298 --> 00:44:50,278
thirty-five days after planting both the

1107
00:44:48,119 --> 00:44:52,919
Kern zone and the perennial rye and so

1108
00:44:50,278 --> 00:44:55,498
just to give you a sense for what the

1109
00:44:52,918 --> 00:44:57,688
farmers are thinking at this point

1110
00:44:55,498 --> 00:45:00,298
getting into this project here are some

1111
00:44:57,688 --> 00:45:04,048
early thoughts some feedback they they

1112
00:45:00,298 --> 00:45:05,880
pass along to Sandra Wayman so tour he

1113
00:45:04,048 --> 00:45:08,248
says he's excited about Kern's uh he

1114
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:10,979
heard about it years ago but skeptical

1115
00:45:08,248 --> 00:45:14,278
of the pathetic looking curds of plants

1116
00:45:10,978 --> 00:45:16,288
coming up so tours uh if you don't know

1117
00:45:14,278 --> 00:45:18,659
tour he he doesn't pull any punches he's

1118
00:45:16,289 --> 00:45:21,329
a fun guy and you know I think he's

1119
00:45:18,659 --> 00:45:22,588
joking around a little bit there but you

1120
00:45:21,329 --> 00:45:25,528
know he's interested to see how it does

1121
00:45:22,588 --> 00:45:28,768
on his somewhat poor soil okay John

1122
00:45:25,528 --> 00:45:30,958
Mayer he's a bit more he's quiet and he

1123
00:45:28,768 --> 00:45:33,148
says uh it's curious so far he hasn't

1124
00:45:30,958 --> 00:45:34,438
had a lot of feedback to share with us

1125
00:45:33,148 --> 00:45:36,088
yet okay

1126
00:45:34,438 --> 00:45:38,788
cloths Martin's on the other hand he's a

1127
00:45:36,088 --> 00:45:40,858
very outspoken he is very concerned

1128
00:45:38,789 --> 00:45:43,289
about the small seed size with Kearns ax

1129
00:45:40,858 --> 00:45:45,119
he has lots of ideas and whenever we go

1130
00:45:43,289 --> 00:45:47,219
and visit with cost Martin's he has a

1131
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:48,899
number of different research ideas that

1132
00:45:47,219 --> 00:45:52,499
he wants us to start working on so

1133
00:45:48,898 --> 00:45:55,348
that's always great it has ideas for the

1134
00:45:52,498 --> 00:45:57,058
breeders so he compares it to Emmer and

1135
00:45:55,349 --> 00:46:00,719
thinks that forage is going to be

1136
00:45:57,059 --> 00:46:03,028
critical for making this work so we're

1137
00:46:00,719 --> 00:46:04,979
getting close to the end here just some

1138
00:46:03,028 --> 00:46:06,809
I just want to highlight you know we've

1139
00:46:04,978 --> 00:46:09,358
talked a lot about the benefits I really

1140
00:46:06,809 --> 00:46:12,509
want people to understand that that

1141
00:46:09,358 --> 00:46:14,909
there are also some drawbacks we are

1142
00:46:12,509 --> 00:46:17,789
moving forward with this but we are very

1143
00:46:14,909 --> 00:46:19,679
well aware of some of the issues so in

1144
00:46:17,789 --> 00:46:22,229
true holiday spirit with the red and

1145
00:46:19,679 --> 00:46:24,148
green I have you know the drawbacks

1146
00:46:22,228 --> 00:46:26,188
listed here so that perennial grains are

1147
00:46:24,148 --> 00:46:28,679
not going to address these food security

1148
00:46:26,188 --> 00:46:31,438
needs and issues that we often talk

1149
00:46:28,679 --> 00:46:34,349
about certainly lower yields than our

1150
00:46:31,438 --> 00:46:35,818
annual counterparts quality you know

1151
00:46:34,349 --> 00:46:37,409
again one of the reasons why we're

1152
00:46:35,818 --> 00:46:40,278
working with tor is because he's very in

1153
00:46:37,409 --> 00:46:42,630
tune with grain quality he has quality

1154
00:46:40,278 --> 00:46:45,539
thresholds that he needs them to meet

1155
00:46:42,630 --> 00:46:46,769
for with his green and and so we are

1156
00:46:45,539 --> 00:46:47,490
going to be working with him to try to

1157
00:46:46,768 --> 00:46:49,589
figure out

1158
00:46:47,489 --> 00:46:51,479
we're Kearns ax and printer I fit in

1159
00:46:49,590 --> 00:46:54,780
what can be done with them in terms of

1160
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:57,300
processing there is potential for your

1161
00:46:54,780 --> 00:46:59,340
pests to build up you know crop rotation

1162
00:46:57,300 --> 00:47:02,370
in annual cropping systems all right

1163
00:46:59,340 --> 00:47:04,590
that is probably the best way best

1164
00:47:02,369 --> 00:47:07,349
cultural practice for managing pests and

1165
00:47:04,590 --> 00:47:09,120
so if we're not doing that in perennial

1166
00:47:07,349 --> 00:47:11,329
grain cropping systems you know there's

1167
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:14,519
potential for these pests to build up

1168
00:47:11,329 --> 00:47:17,940
depending on where you're at if you're

1169
00:47:14,519 --> 00:47:20,159
using aquifers to an irrigation

1170
00:47:17,940 --> 00:47:22,440
perennial grains might be an issue

1171
00:47:20,159 --> 00:47:23,699
because of the water use okay in the

1172
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:25,170
Northeast we don't really see this being

1173
00:47:23,699 --> 00:47:27,089
a big problem a lot of times we have

1174
00:47:25,170 --> 00:47:28,980
more water than what we need but

1175
00:47:27,090 --> 00:47:33,120
depending on where you're at in the West

1176
00:47:28,980 --> 00:47:35,610
that can be an issue so covered a lot

1177
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:37,529
just to reiterate the take-home messages

1178
00:47:35,610 --> 00:47:40,349
so perennial greens are becoming an

1179
00:47:37,530 --> 00:47:42,990
option there's an increasing interest we

1180
00:47:40,349 --> 00:47:46,489
see ecosystem services the integration

1181
00:47:42,989 --> 00:47:48,869
strategy again the if you are using

1182
00:47:46,489 --> 00:47:52,679
polycultures you know the putting the

1183
00:47:48,869 --> 00:47:53,880
the complementary species together you

1184
00:47:52,679 --> 00:47:56,279
know it's going to be important where

1185
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:59,280
you put it on the landscape okay instead

1186
00:47:56,280 --> 00:48:00,600
of taking your your prime AG land that

1187
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:02,880
you're growing annual green crops in

1188
00:48:00,599 --> 00:48:05,489
perhaps putting them in sloped land or

1189
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:07,829
using contour strips you know there may

1190
00:48:05,489 --> 00:48:10,949
be ways that we can integrate print no

1191
00:48:07,829 --> 00:48:13,529
greens in a very meaningful way without

1192
00:48:10,949 --> 00:48:16,289
getting ourselves into too much trouble

1193
00:48:13,530 --> 00:48:17,540
in terms of having these low yields and

1194
00:48:16,289 --> 00:48:20,820
decreasing profitability

1195
00:48:17,539 --> 00:48:22,860
so for agronomists in the room so we

1196
00:48:20,820 --> 00:48:24,690
really need more people working on on

1197
00:48:22,860 --> 00:48:26,579
perennial grains we need to come up with

1198
00:48:24,690 --> 00:48:28,619
best management practices and be able to

1199
00:48:26,579 --> 00:48:32,759
provide farmers with information that

1200
00:48:28,619 --> 00:48:34,679
they need to optimize production so just

1201
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:36,930
like to say thanks for people who have

1202
00:48:34,679 --> 00:48:39,599
contributed to this project people have

1203
00:48:36,929 --> 00:48:41,609
contributed seed helped out with the

1204
00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:43,259
field work and also there are several

1205
00:48:41,610 --> 00:48:45,360
people on here that are working on the

1206
00:48:43,260 --> 00:48:49,130
review paper with me so thank you very

1207
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:49,130
much I'd be happy to take any questions

1208
00:48:51,289 --> 00:49:00,110
this has been a production of Cornell
