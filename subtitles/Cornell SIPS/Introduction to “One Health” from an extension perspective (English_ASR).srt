00:00:13,119 --> 00:00:17,358
Hi, welcome. Thank you all for joining

2
00:00:15,119 --> 00:00:19,358
today. Um, I'm really excited to present

3
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:21,520
on one health and you'll see why in a

4
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:26,400
moment of why I'm really passionate

5
00:00:21,519 --> 00:00:26,399
about this topic. Uh, to get us started

6
00:00:26,439 --> 00:00:31,599
though, get me my slides will advance.

7
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:34,320
There we go. I'm going to tell you a

8
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:36,880
little bit about myself. So, my name is

9
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:39,359
Sharon Toth. I'm a county for agent in

10
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,879
Hunter County, New Jersey, which I

11
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:42,159
realize when I say that that doesn't

12
00:00:40,878 --> 00:00:43,839
mean anything unless you're from New

13
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:46,878
Jersey, but it's this little red dot

14
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:48,559
over here. It is uh borders

15
00:00:46,878 --> 00:00:49,479
Pennsylvania. So, I'm about 15 minutes

16
00:00:48,558 --> 00:00:51,599
from

17
00:00:49,479 --> 00:00:53,279
Pennsylvania. And I work for Rucker

18
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,719
Cooperative Extension or Ruckers

19
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,239
University. That's our land grant

20
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:58,320
institution.

21
00:00:56,238 --> 00:01:00,718
I received my bachelor of science in

22
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,558
evolutionary anthropology from Ruckers

23
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:04,439
and then my PhD in biological

24
00:01:02,558 --> 00:01:06,959
anthropology from the University of

25
00:01:04,438 --> 00:01:08,959
Pittsburgh. And I like to say that I

26
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:10,959
transfer lies by merging researcher

27
00:01:08,959 --> 00:01:12,959
methodologies with educator techniques.

28
00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:16,639
And I feel like I will represent that

29
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:18,639
through my talk today. And my background

30
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:21,040
always looks like why how did I get into

31
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,879
4 with an anthropology degree? But it's

32
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,640
because I was a lifelong 4er and I

33
00:01:22,879 --> 00:01:27,118
really valued the experiences that I

34
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:29,439
learned in 4 and through extension and I

35
00:01:27,118 --> 00:01:32,680
wanted to bring back that information to

36
00:01:29,438 --> 00:01:36,078
my community that I learned in

37
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:38,400
school. So my presentation today is

38
00:01:36,078 --> 00:01:40,719
going to have three main areas. I'm

39
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:43,200
going to define what one health is and

40
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:45,920
why it's important. I'm going to talk

41
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:48,719
about what I did during my research days

42
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:52,879
as a PhD student and then how I apply

43
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:52,879
that to being a county for

44
00:01:53,319 --> 00:01:57,679
agent. So what is one health? We keep

45
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,438
using this term but what does it really

46
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:04,399
mean? It is a collaborative or intercon

47
00:02:01,438 --> 00:02:07,159
in interconnectedness of human animal

48
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:09,038
and environmental health. It's a

49
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:11,359
multi-disciplinary approach that

50
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:12,958
recognizes that the health of people,

51
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,800
animals, and the environment are all

52
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:17,360
connected. We're not siloed from each

53
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:19,680
other. It brings to together experts

54
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:21,040
from all different fields from human

55
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,120
medicine, veterinary medicine,

56
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:25,439
environmental science, and beyond to

57
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:27,599
solve complex health problems like

58
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:30,719
zunotic diseases, food safety, and

59
00:02:27,598 --> 00:02:33,759
climate change. So some examples that we

60
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:36,560
see of one health and how we see it

61
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:39,598
every day in our society is aven flu

62
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:43,680

67
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,200
human health animal health and

68
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:58,878
environmental health they all

69
00:02:56,199 --> 00:03:01,759
interconnect this ven diagram I believe

70
00:02:58,878 --> 00:03:05,840
does a really great job of representing

71
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:05,840
what how one health connects

72
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,800
together. So here's a simplified version

73
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:15,840
I really like to educate with. It's

74
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:18,319
shows cows graze next to lettuce field

75
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:21,519
and cows can carry ecoli but still look

76
00:03:18,318 --> 00:03:23,919
healthy. Then the E.coli from cow manure

77
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:26,400
in the nearby farm can contaminate the

78
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:28,559
lettuce field. And then people eat

79
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:31,200
contaminated lettuce and can become

80
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,920
infected with E.coli and then serious

81
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:35,039
illness or even sometimes death can

82
00:03:32,919 --> 00:03:37,280
result. So this is just a really

83
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:39,759
simplified version of how those animals

84
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:42,479
health a human animal and the

85
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:45,840
environment all connect.

86
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:48,919
And one of my favorite examples is that

87
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:51,759
of the development of insulin for

88
00:03:48,919 --> 00:03:54,399
diabetes. So this is a life-saving

89
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:56,318
example because of the anatomical and

90
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,560
clinical similarities in the dog and

91
00:03:56,318 --> 00:03:59,719
human prank pancreas. It aided in the

92
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:03,360
development of

93
00:03:59,719 --> 00:04:05,519
insulin. So in the early 1920s,

94
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:08,159
scientists studied dogs to understand

95
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:09,920
how the pancreas regulates blood sugar.

96
00:04:08,158 --> 00:04:12,479
They discovered that removing the

97
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:14,639
pancreas caused diabetes and that

98
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:16,959
insulin from healthy pancreases could

99
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:18,039
restore balance and it was a major

100
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:20,720
medical

101
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:23,360
breakthrough. So this research directly

102
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:26,560
led to the first effective treatment for

103
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:29,600
for diabetes in humans saving millions

104
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:33,600
of lives. So early insulin was made

105
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:35,680
using pancreases from cows and pigs and

106
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,720
it was turning that fatal disease into a

107
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:40,639
manageable one people can live

108
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:42,160
with. And this has connects to the

109
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:45,360
environment though because early

110
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:47,120
production relied on h animal byproducts

111
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:49,520
linking insulin to agriculture and

112
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,840
livestock practices. But eventually

113
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:54,560
concerns over supply and sustainability

114
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:57,439
led to biotech innovations that now

115
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:59,918
produce uh synthetic insulin that still

116
00:04:57,439 --> 00:05:01,918
today is used for millions of lives. And

117
00:04:59,918 --> 00:05:05,279
then why people who have diabetes can

118
00:05:01,918 --> 00:05:05,279
continue on living a normal

119
00:05:05,478 --> 00:05:10,560
life and I personally like that model

120
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:12,639
because it does use a dog model and this

121
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:16,399
is what I used in my research when I was

122
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:18,160
a PhD student. So a lot of times when we

123
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:21,159
think of animal models, we may think of

124
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:24,639
using pigs. We see that a lot or maybe

125
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:28,400
mice, but different animal models exist

126
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:30,478
for different reasons. So for dogs, it's

127
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:34,959
specifically interesting because they

128
00:05:30,478 --> 00:05:37,680
share 80% of diseases with us. And

129
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:40,560
mostly of the nearly 400 inherited

130
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:42,720
disorders characterized in dogs are

131
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,720
relevant to humans.

132
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:47,960
So they make them an excellent model for

133
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:50,720
numerous human diseases such as cancer,

134
00:05:47,959 --> 00:05:53,279
osteoarthritis, aging, and for me it was

135
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:55,440
knee ligament rupture. So I studied the

136
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:58,239
ACL in the knee and I'll go into that a

137
00:05:55,439 --> 00:06:00,160
little bit more and they have a very

138
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,800
similar structure. It is the gold

139
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:05,400
standard for us and it has it because of

140
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:08,639
the hisytological

141
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:11,120
similarity and also with dogs beyond

142
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:13,680
sharing similar diseases they are a

143
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:15,280
useful model due to accessibility. They

144
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,680
live in diverse environments like

145
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:19,918
humans. They share the same environments

146
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:23,038
with us. So they're exposed to the same

147
00:06:19,918 --> 00:06:25,359
bacteria, pollutants and toxins and they

148
00:06:23,038 --> 00:06:26,879
exhibit breed specific diseases some

149
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,400
that are very rare in humans like

150
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:29,759
sarcomomas.

151
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:32,399
They also have the appearance of

152
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:35,120
spontaneous diseases as opposed to being

153
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:37,599
induced like in mice and they age five

154
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:40,079
to eight times faster than humans aiding

155
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:42,479
in a disease timeline allowing for

156
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:45,198
observation of disease onset and

157
00:06:42,478 --> 00:06:47,918
condensed study time. Dogs are also the

158
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:49,600
most physically diverse species and have

159
00:06:47,918 --> 00:06:52,560
the most known naturally occurring

160
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:55,360
diseases of all land man land mammals

161
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:58,319
after humans.

162
00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:00,240
So I use them to study the ACL and knee

163
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:04,280
because of all these similarities and

164
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:07,360
their usefulness in modeling human

165
00:07:04,279 --> 00:07:09,758
research. So the main intention of my

166
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:12,879
study was to correlate biological

167
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:15,280
variables and ACL rupture patterns by

168
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:19,038
using comparative anatomy of human and

169
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:21,918
dog knees. The predisposition factors

170
00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:24,639
for non-cont ACL rupture is not really

171
00:07:21,918 --> 00:07:26,639
well understood. Basically the force

172
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:29,240
twisting motion of this ligament in the

173
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:32,079
knee does not produce consistent rupture

174
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:35,439
patterns. This research aids to reduce

175
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:38,478
future ACL rupture incidence rates while

176
00:07:35,439 --> 00:07:42,079
mutually benefiting humans and medicine

177
00:07:38,478 --> 00:07:42,079
uh human and animal medicine

178
00:07:42,439 --> 00:07:49,759
further. So sometimes we hear the dog

179
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:51,639
term CCL versus ACL. It means the same

180
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:53,520
thing. They're called homologous

181
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:57,160
structures, which means they have

182
00:07:53,519 --> 00:08:00,318
similar structures due to shared

183
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:02,400
ancestry. And comparable to humans, some

184
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:05,520
dogs rupture this ligament at a greater

185
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:09,000
rate than others. And 80% of ruptures

186
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:11,839
are non-cont, similar to that 70% in

187
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:14,639
humans. And we see that spayed female

188
00:08:11,839 --> 00:08:16,959
dogs are at the highest risk of CCL

189
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:19,598
rupture. And both spayed or neutered

190
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:21,598
dogs, regardless of sex, have

191
00:08:19,598 --> 00:08:24,478
significantly higher rupture rates than

192
00:08:21,598 --> 00:08:26,478
sexually intact dogs. And the reason for

193
00:08:24,478 --> 00:08:29,360
these rupture disparities in dogs is

194
00:08:26,478 --> 00:08:29,359
unknown like in

195
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:37,838
humans. So why is this all important?

196
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:38,880
Why do we care about how about our knee?

197
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:41,599
Why don't we just say, "Well, we'll

198
00:08:38,879 --> 00:08:45,759
brace it. It'll be fine." It's because

199
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:48,080
mo muskeletal conditions affect 1.7

200
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:51,439
billion people in the world and it

201
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:53,759
contributes to nearly 166 million years

202
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:56,000
lived with disability and make the

203
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:59,639
largest proportion of persistent pain in

204
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,440
all geographical regions and age groups.

205
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:03,838
Muscularkeeletal conditions are the

206
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,680
leading cause of disability worldwide.

207
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:07,839
And the reason for early leave or

208
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:10,719
retirement from work, contributing to

209
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:12,640
less financial security is also lack of

210
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:15,080
physical activity can contribute to

211
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:17,519
declined mental health and physical

212
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:19,519
health. Knee injuries are also the

213
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:22,480
second most commonly injured site after

214
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:24,879
the ankle with the ACL ruptures

215
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:27,879
accounting for over 50% of those

216
00:09:24,879 --> 00:09:27,879
injuries.

217
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,159
Men account for the majority of ACL

218
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:33,919
ruptures, but women are more likely to

219
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:35,919
rupture it at a two to eight times

220
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:38,079
greater rate. While surgical

221
00:09:35,919 --> 00:09:41,120
interventions and rehab or common

222
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:44,600
practice, only about 50% of people will

223
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:47,440
return to their full pre-injury injury

224
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:49,600
state. So this increase this increases

225
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:52,080
rehabilitation and surgical costs and

226
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:56,839
less chance of full sports into

227
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:56,839
reintegration or even mobility.

228
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,279
And as a female, I find this

229
00:10:01,278 --> 00:10:06,000
specifically interesting because they're

230
00:10:03,278 --> 00:10:07,080
at a two times greater rate to rupture

231
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,958
their

232
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:13,519
ACL and especially for ages 15 to 19

233
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:16,039
years old. And female sports

234
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:19,440
participation has increased more than

235
00:10:16,039 --> 00:10:21,759
1,000% since the passing of Title 9.

236
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:24,959
that where all institutions that receive

237
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:26,639
federal money must offer equal access to

238
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:30,000
curricular and extracurricular

239
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:32,319
activities for men and women. And nearly

240
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,039
8 million students currently participate

241
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:37,920
in high school sports with continuously

242
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:40,000
rising numbers over the past 29 years

243
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:42,000
and female participation an all-time

244
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,519
high with more than 3.4 million

245
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,839
athletes.

246
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:48,720
This increase in female participation

247
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:51,360
suggests ACL studies prior to Title N

248
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:54,278
were really focused only on men and that

249
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:56,800
we don't have an equal

250
00:10:54,278 --> 00:11:01,759
representation. And only in the past 30

251
00:10:56,799 --> 00:11:04,399
years uh since 1993 did the NIH mandate

252
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:05,480
that their funds be used for women and

253
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:08,480
men in their

254
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:12,480
studies. And also women only represent

255
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:15,360
4% of orthopedic surgeons.

256
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:17,519
So throughout the study I use golden the

257
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:20,000
golden retriever lifetime study done by

258
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:21,039
the Morris research foundation and what

259
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,519
I found was that it was a

260
00:11:21,039 --> 00:11:27,759
multiffactorial process. There was no

261
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:29,600
one cause for it and that it was hor

262
00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:32,559
hormone regulations played a large piece

263
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:34,159
which is impacted by our environment and

264
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:36,719
that that impacted growth and

265
00:11:34,159 --> 00:11:39,600
development on bone structure and how we

266
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:41,600
function and move. So that was a really

267
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,120
quick summary of what I did. But how do

268
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,399
I apply this all? What does that have to

269
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:47,839
do with extension? How do I apply this

270
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:50,879
to my 4 teaching? I'm so glad you asked.

271
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:53,720
So I implement one of the most popular 4

272
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:56,480
curriculum that we see, which is 4

273
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:59,600
embryology. This is very popular across

274
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:01,600
the nation and that is where youth hatch

275
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:03,920
eggs in the classroom to learn about

276
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,920
growth and development and this relates

277
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:08,319
directly to one health. So from the

278
00:12:05,919 --> 00:12:09,919
animal perspective, they're getting

279
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,760
youth are getting investment in another

280
00:12:09,919 --> 00:12:14,399
life. They're seeing the growth and

281
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:16,000
development of an animal. From humans,

282
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:17,278
they're also seeing the zunotic

283
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,600
diseases. They're learning about

284
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:21,439
biocurity and the importance of

285
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:24,240
maintaining a healthy environment for

286
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:26,240
the animals and themselves. And in the

287
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:28,799
environment especially, they're seeing

288
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:31,120
how the environment impacts development.

289
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:33,359
like I saw in my dissertation research,

290
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:35,919
how development impacts our bone

291
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:38,959
structures and hormonal impacts. That's

292
00:12:35,919 --> 00:12:41,360
the same here with embryology just on a

293
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:44,078
smaller scale. They also talk about

294
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:47,200
sustainable farming and food systems.

295
00:12:44,078 --> 00:12:49,359
So, how do we be sustainable farmers

296
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:52,839
while we produce food to feed our nation

297
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,839
and our people?

298
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:59,278
And then I also do a workshop called

299
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:01,519
bone vage exploring domestication

300
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:02,838
through bone. So my background in

301
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:05,360
anatomy and

302
00:13:02,839 --> 00:13:07,639
osteology which is where workshops where

303
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:10,000
participants learned about

304
00:13:07,639 --> 00:13:11,680
domestication. So from that animal and

305
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,240
human perspective they're learning about

306
00:13:11,679 --> 00:13:17,039
the symbiotic relationship the shared

307
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:18,959
relationship we have with each other and

308
00:13:17,039 --> 00:13:21,360
how we pro improved health with each

309
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:23,278
other. We helped animals improved their

310
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:26,159
health but they also helped us through

311
00:13:23,278 --> 00:13:28,200
domestication processes. And then also

312
00:13:26,159 --> 00:13:30,838
we talk about the impact on bone

313
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:33,278
preservation which is the term

314
00:13:30,839 --> 00:13:35,680
tethphonomy. So why is it so hard like

315
00:13:33,278 --> 00:13:37,799
you can see in this photo to recognize

316
00:13:35,679 --> 00:13:39,919
when an animal has been

317
00:13:37,799 --> 00:13:42,479
domesticated. It's not always easy.

318
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:45,120
There's no defined aspect that goes this

319
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:48,000
animal has been domesticated. So it's a

320
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:50,159
very gradual change. And so I do a

321
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,879
workshop where youth get to part work

322
00:13:50,159 --> 00:13:54,799
with bones hands on. So right here

323
00:13:52,879 --> 00:13:58,120
they're holding a horse femur and they

324
00:13:54,799 --> 00:14:01,198
get to understand what the

325
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:03,519
anatomy looks like. And then we use

326
00:14:01,198 --> 00:14:06,078
paper cutouts. So they get to create

327
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:08,560
their own animal after they make uh

328
00:14:06,078 --> 00:14:12,799
their the original animal. So this one

329
00:14:08,559 --> 00:14:14,239
here is a beaver, a rabbit, and a dog.

330
00:14:12,799 --> 00:14:16,838
And they have to give the background

331
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:20,720
information of why they do

332
00:14:16,839 --> 00:14:23,600
that. And then I have a pug here because

333
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:26,720
I talked about that improved health. So

334
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:29,040
dogs being that highly diverse species,

335
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:31,839
they being the mostly diverse species on

336
00:14:29,039 --> 00:14:35,439
Earth, it's because we've bred them so

337
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:37,760
widely. Pugs have that flat face. It's

338
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:40,160
called brachiophalic and why they have

339
00:14:37,759 --> 00:14:44,519
hard time breathing. And that gives us a

340
00:14:40,159 --> 00:14:47,360
lot of information on respiratory

341
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:49,440
diseases. And if you don't have an

342
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,919
animal science program in your county,

343
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,040
that's all right. One health still

344
00:14:50,919 --> 00:14:55,838
applies. So you can talk about one

345
00:14:53,039 --> 00:14:58,719
health and for technology such as AI's

346
00:14:55,839 --> 00:15:00,320
impact on society. So when you talk

347
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:02,959
about AI, you can talk about the

348
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:06,399
benefits and dangers to society, but

349
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:08,799
also the environmental impact. So the AI

350
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:11,519
data centers take a lot of water and

351
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:13,519
power to produce. So this talking about

352
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:15,759
while they might benefit us, it can

353
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:17,879
really endanger our environment. So it's

354
00:15:15,759 --> 00:15:20,480
important to talk about this

355
00:15:17,879 --> 00:15:22,559
all-encompassing product of human,

356
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:26,519
animal, and environmental health

357
00:15:22,559 --> 00:15:28,958
together. We're not siloed from each

358
00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:31,278
other. So thank you very much for

359
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:33,838
joining me. Uh here's my information if

360
00:15:31,278 --> 00:15:35,679
you would like to contact me more. And

361
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:37,360
I'm just gonna quickly drop this link

362
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:39,838
into the chat if you don't mind. It's a

363
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:44,680
two question answer. I'd love for you to

364
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:44,680
take time to answer that. Thank you.

365
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:50,879
So Sharon, I have a quick question for

366
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:53,440
you. Yep. Can you bring to life uh the

367
00:15:50,879 --> 00:15:55,759
contemporary issue of bird flu uh with

368
00:15:53,440 --> 00:16:00,040
climate change and one health? Just sort

369
00:15:55,759 --> 00:16:00,039
of give us that sort of synopsis.

370
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:05,039
Could you could you I'm sorry. Could you

371
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:08,240
uh rephrase? Sorry.

372
00:16:05,039 --> 00:16:12,078
So, uh the bird flu and the environment,

373
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:15,039
how climate change and bird flu are are

374
00:16:12,078 --> 00:16:16,799
coming together and as it relates to one

375
00:16:15,039 --> 00:16:20,159
from a one health perspective of

376
00:16:16,799 --> 00:16:22,000
analyzing it. Oh, perfect. So, the aven

377
00:16:20,159 --> 00:16:25,919
flu being so prominent now, we know it's

378
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:28,879
a zunotic disease. It can spread easily.

379
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:31,120
Humans, birds, and swine can spread

380
00:16:28,879 --> 00:16:34,159
through each other. While we don't we're

381
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:35,759
not seeing many cases in the disease

382
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:38,480
spreading to humans, there have been

383
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:41,519
cases even in our county where it was

384
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:44,639
found in feral cats. So the environment

385
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:47,360
plays a part because most of avian flu

386
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:50,240
is being spread by wildlife. So when

387
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:52,079
they fly over uh chicken coupe and they

388
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:54,000
they poop and it comes down into your

389
00:16:52,078 --> 00:16:57,039
coupe that's spreading the disease

390
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:59,759
further. So by having precautions and

391
00:16:57,039 --> 00:17:02,719
biocurity is the big thing of protecting

392
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:04,480
your coupe. So making sure if you walk

393
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:07,519
you go to visit somebody's coupe for

394
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:10,078
instance you are not wearing the same

395
00:17:07,519 --> 00:17:12,798
type of shoes that you wear to your

396
00:17:10,078 --> 00:17:15,918
coupe. Your coupe those are the only

397
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:18,240
shoes that ever go to your coupe and

398
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:19,839
that they stay on your property. And if

399
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:22,480
you ever go to somebody else's, you make

400
00:17:19,838 --> 00:17:25,038
sure to sanitize and clean for the

401
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:27,519
safety and it reduces the spread of that

402
00:17:25,038 --> 00:17:27,519
disease

403
00:17:30,599 --> 00:17:33,839
elsewhere. Are there any other

404
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,679
questions? I hope I answered that.

405
00:17:33,839 --> 00:17:38,678
Please let me know if I was not clear on

406
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:38,679
that.
