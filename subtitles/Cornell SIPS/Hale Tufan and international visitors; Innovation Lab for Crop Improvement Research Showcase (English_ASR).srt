1
00:00:00,599 --> 00:00:04,240
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:06,559 --> 00:00:10,718
University well welcome everyone thank

3
00:00:08,679 --> 00:00:12,798
you for joining us it's a really special

4
00:00:10,718 --> 00:00:15,599
seminar today and I'm really happy to be

5
00:00:12,798 --> 00:00:17,519
hosting visitors um and I really wish we

6
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:19,039
could have one plant breeding seminar

7
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:20,759
per visitor because the wealth of

8
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:22,400
information and experience of the people

9
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:24,760
who are here for the next two weeks I'll

10
00:00:22,399 --> 00:00:27,038
talk about is enormous but we don't have

11
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:28,320
time so we're just going to have a panel

12
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:30,640
discussion everybody's going to get to

13
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,039
share kind of their experience

14
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,600
um and just to say that we're lucky that

15
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:36,200
everybody's here today us visas have

16
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:37,960
been very difficult so we put together

17
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:40,120
Workshop it's taking a long time so

18
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:42,120
appreciating the effort that went into

19
00:00:40,119 --> 00:00:43,759
that so today with us we have everybody

20
00:00:42,119 --> 00:00:47,119
will introduce themselves but I'll just

21
00:00:43,759 --> 00:00:49,159
briefly give names so Sophia divage

22
00:00:47,119 --> 00:00:51,759
Evelyn Luis and

23
00:00:49,159 --> 00:00:53,878
Simon um so together I just want to set

24
00:00:51,759 --> 00:00:55,878
the scene for why we're here some of you

25
00:00:53,878 --> 00:00:57,358
who came to Martina's talk last week may

26
00:00:55,878 --> 00:00:59,238
have heard about the Innovation lab for

27
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:01,198
crop Improvement she mentioned some

28
00:00:59,238 --> 00:01:02,799
collaborative work work there so the

29
00:01:01,198 --> 00:01:04,838
Innovation lab for crop Improvement is a

30
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:07,200
feed the future program and we really

31
00:01:04,838 --> 00:01:09,438
work with national agricultural research

32
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,799
institutes globally On Tools

33
00:01:09,438 --> 00:01:14,079
Technologies and methods that increase

34
00:01:11,799 --> 00:01:15,560
Effectiveness and impact from crop

35
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:18,359
reading programs so that's kind of the

36
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:19,840
central man and there's many programs

37
00:01:18,359 --> 00:01:22,040
that we engage with I'm not going to go

38
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:24,439
into the details but just point out four

39
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:26,159
centers of innovation these are nodes

40
00:01:24,438 --> 00:01:28,839
where a lot of the research takes place

41
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:31,640
the first is syphus based with nari and

42
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:34,359
Uganda with collab ations in Kenya and

43
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:36,319
Tanzania the second one is cesa that's

44
00:01:34,359 --> 00:01:37,959
centered in Malawi at luanar with

45
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:40,359
collaborations in Tanzania and

46
00:01:37,959 --> 00:01:42,438
Mozambique and in West Africa we have

47
00:01:40,359 --> 00:01:44,438
siwa that's centered in Sagal with

48
00:01:42,438 --> 00:01:47,599
collaborations in Nigeria and Bina

49
00:01:44,438 --> 00:01:49,679
fossil and lastly in uh the Caribbean in

50
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:51,559
Central America we have katcha that's a

51
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:55,240
collaboration with casaya University in

52
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:57,759
Haiti and Inta and Costa Rico So within

53
00:01:55,239 --> 00:01:59,158
all of those breeding programs across

54
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:01,718
multiple crops there are social

55
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:04,479
scientists doing work with the breeding

56
00:02:01,718 --> 00:02:06,959
programs to really reorient to make sure

57
00:02:04,478 --> 00:02:09,118
their breeding is socially impactful and

58
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:10,919
considering different issues so there's

59
00:02:09,118 --> 00:02:13,479
a group of us and we work under what's

60
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:15,199
called priority setting and crosscutting

61
00:02:13,479 --> 00:02:17,878
issues cross cutting issues are gender

62
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:20,799
equality youth inclusion nutrition

63
00:02:17,878 --> 00:02:22,239
resilience and inclusion more broadly so

64
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,879
a lot of we're a group of social

65
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:25,759
scientists kind of working across those

66
00:02:23,878 --> 00:02:28,120
domains and we really generate knowledge

67
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:29,878
but also tools and methods to help diet

68
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:32,039
breeding program so today you'll hear a

69
00:02:29,878 --> 00:02:34,919
little bit about the experience not only

70
00:02:32,039 --> 00:02:36,878
on this project but beyond the project

71
00:02:34,919 --> 00:02:39,158
um so I'm going to start us off with

72
00:02:36,878 --> 00:02:42,719

agriculture research organization

81
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:06,959
uh the national agriculture

82
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:11,598
organization has a

83
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:15,759
mandate of conducting research in

84
00:03:11,598 --> 00:03:17,598
Uganda uh research on differing on crops

85
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:22,280
livestock

86
00:03:17,598 --> 00:03:28,120

00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:47,199
crops and uh as far as cphims is

92
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:50,598
concerned uh we are targeting okay the

93
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:53,479
project is on finger Millet and

94
00:03:50,598 --> 00:03:57,839
soam and these two projects I mean these

95
00:03:53,479 --> 00:04:00,639
two cops are under Dryland crops in

96
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:02,680
Uganda so

97
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:07,359

mainly to evaluate the Technologies

100
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:18,079
developed by

101
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:22,360
breeders and uh we work hand in

102
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:24,000
hand uh this project uh its uh main

103

objective is to

104
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:31,120
accelerate uh development and release of

105
00:04:27,879 --> 00:04:34,478
finger Millet and uh so

106
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:38,879

you okay hi everyone I'm Evelyn comp so

129
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:54,038
I come from West Africa Bina

130
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:56,199
Faso and I by training I did science

131
00:05:54,038 --> 00:05:59,079
technology and Innovation studies in

132
00:05:56,199 --> 00:06:00,879
sociology and social policy and I work

133
00:05:59,079 --> 00:06:03,000
for the National Institute for

134
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:05,478
agriculture and environment based in

135
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:08,439
Bina Faso like what my colleague was

136
00:06:05,478 --> 00:06:11,000
saying we have like 10

137
00:06:08,439 --> 00:06:13,598
different sections throughout the

138
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:18,680
country and I'm in the central part is

139
00:06:13,598 --> 00:06:21,959
the biggest Center in the country and uh

140
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:25,639
I also teach at the University of Joseph

141
00:06:21,959 --> 00:06:28,918
keru in Bina Faso I teach like action

142
00:06:25,639 --> 00:06:31,759
research and I also teach a so

143
00:06:28,918 --> 00:06:37,359
development sociology modules at the

144
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:39,319
University and at inera I work I got a

145
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:42,080
let's say is a large team but in the

146
00:06:39,319 --> 00:06:44,759
central part we we got part of the team

147
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:48,399
looking at Cross cutting related issue

148
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:51,038
which is mostly socio economic studies

149
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:53,478
and also gender related issue because

150
00:06:51,038 --> 00:06:54,839
socio economy is big and inside social

151
00:06:53,478 --> 00:06:57,918
economy we have some sometimes to look

152
00:06:54,839 --> 00:07:03,239
at disaggregated information based on

153
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:07,279
gender or based on age and Etc and uh we

154
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:09,759
work on so many aspects in got many

155
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:12,159
departments among the department we have

156
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:14,759
the breeding Department we have soil

157
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:18,080
scientist we have geography Department

158
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:22,199
we have also social scientist and I must

159
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:25,758
say on breeding we go we do breeding in

160
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:28,400
most of the crop like uh I would say

161
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:30,120
rice and Maze which are the main crops

162
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:34,000
which have received quite lot of funds

163
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:36,038
in the past and in the case of ilc the

164
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:40,038
the project we are collaborating with

165
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:43,478
colel and my colleagues here we focus on

166
00:07:40,038 --> 00:07:46,199
CI which is a the most famous legum in

167
00:07:43,478 --> 00:07:49,800
bukina it used to be women crop and it

168
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:52,840
turned out to become a cash crop so mens

169
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:56,879
are taking the lead and we have also

170
00:07:52,839 --> 00:08:00,318
millets and sorum and also ground nuts

171
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:04,599
part of these crops and I just want to

172
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:07,560
say that among these crops as breeding

173
00:08:04,598 --> 00:08:10,120
we also do breeding on vegetables and

174
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:15,280
also like tomatoes onion but this part

175
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:17,959
is quite for now is an ongoing work and

176
00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:21,198
other vegetables and also the dry crops

177
00:08:17,959 --> 00:08:23,439
I just named I wouldn't say they

178
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:25,639
neglected because now they're coming up

179
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:28,560
very well and lot of effort have been

180
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:31,519
doing by funders and research on this

181
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:34,399
level so I should say I am so pleased to

182
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:37,838

talk about my experience and also the

184
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:44,080
experience as a group in the project and

185
00:08:40,278 --> 00:08:47,360
as a researcher in West Africa yeah

186
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:50,920
where agriculture is the main source of

187
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:55,800
Revenue and also the main source of

188
00:08:50,919 --> 00:08:55,799
living everyday life thank you so

189
00:08:57,919 --> 00:09:04,599

00:09:20,879 --> 00:09:30,439
project that we ER make with Kisa

197
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:33,120
University in it I am part of um

198
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:36,480
National research of agriculture in

199
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:41,200
Costa Rica that is part of minister of

200
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:44,639
Agriculture um in in this project in CIA

201
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:46,759
we are working in three crops in sorum

202
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:49,240
in Comm bean that is part a very

203
00:09:46,759 --> 00:09:53,240
important part of the our food in Costa

204
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:54,879
Rica and in in in sweet

205

we are in a

211
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:17,439
um participative evaluation with a

212
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:19,200
method that we are working with with ilc

213
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:23,120
that is the triode in

214
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:25,320
surum and we are making in a couple of

215
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:27,200
months we are going to make a

216
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:29,640
fingerprinting

217
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:33,959
um H fingerprinting

218
00:10:29,639 --> 00:10:36,278
for evaluate our common being

219
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:40,599
um reading

220
00:10:36,278 --> 00:10:43,720
program and that is part what I what

221
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:46,240
that my team is is working on now in in

222
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:48,160
in this project and it's it's a pleasure

223

uh

236
00:11:23,039 --> 00:11:32,000
eminent uh team and uh in the project

237
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:34,240
which is supported by ilc uh we are

238
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,559
working on social

239
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:40,399
inclusion uh for food

240
00:11:36,559 --> 00:11:43,759
security and incomes and increasing the

241
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:47,480
voice of marginalized farmers in

242
00:11:43,759 --> 00:11:49,319
Kenya uh more about it uh in the next

243
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:51,440
session thank

244
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:53,879
Youk thank you so much everyone for

245
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:55,560
introducing yourselves and welcome again

246
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:57,200
um so we're going to have two sets of

247
00:11:55,559 --> 00:11:58,638
questions and then open question and

248
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,800
answer at the end so we're going to

249
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:02,759
start with with going to ask um three

250
00:12:00,799 --> 00:12:05,439
panelists to give examples where some of

251
00:12:02,759 --> 00:12:07,159
their work has been impactful in

252
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:08,680
informing the breeding program just to

253
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:11,799
give you an example of what this looks

254
00:12:08,679 --> 00:12:14,559
like in action right um G start with

255
00:12:11,799 --> 00:12:16,958
Louise okay

256
00:12:14,559 --> 00:12:22,799
yeah okay thank you very much this is a

257
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:26,159
a a simple um example um I have to give

258
00:12:22,799 --> 00:12:29,359
you a little context about it

259
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:32,519
ER these project are very helpful for us

260
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:34,879
we have to be very strategic because we

261
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:38,360
have we don't have enough time for a

262
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:42,480
plan breing process we have just we need

263
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:46,159
our our process in planing take like six

264
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:48,639
or eight years and this project is about

265
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:53,120
three years so we have to be very smart

266
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:55,680
and strategic to to try to to to adopt

267
00:12:53,120 --> 00:13:03,560
the technology that ELC provide us and

268
00:12:55,679 --> 00:13:05,198
try to to to go the goals right so H we

269
00:13:03,559 --> 00:13:10,638
have

270
00:13:05,198 --> 00:13:16,000
um six no five prising lines materials

271
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:20,039
of common Red Pins it's okay and this

272
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:24,519
these six um these five H lines come

273
00:13:20,039 --> 00:13:30,278
from a um breathing process that take

274
00:13:24,519 --> 00:13:35,039
like six years it stting in 200 7th this

275
00:13:30,278 --> 00:13:38,919
lines H was evaluating in um farmer

276
00:13:35,039 --> 00:13:44,120
fields and this is the and we are we

277
00:13:38,919 --> 00:13:49,120
just need er a validating process to

278
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:53,600
release one VAR right

279
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:54,839
H with Casia we we decide to change a

280
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:59,879
little bit the

281
00:13:54,839 --> 00:14:01,920
things to give some ch methods with a

282
00:13:59,879 --> 00:14:04,919
with a plant

283
00:14:01,919 --> 00:14:04,919
breeding

284
00:14:05,879 --> 00:14:12,278
um the the the way that they made this

285
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:16,919
this this this validation in the

286
00:14:12,278 --> 00:14:19,480
past ER they select some Farmers that

287
00:14:16,919 --> 00:14:21,360
they trust like

288
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:25,440
30

289
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:28,278
and H we talk to to to the to the plb

290
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:29,720
and told him that H change a little bit

291
00:14:28,278 --> 00:14:34,240
the things

292
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:39,120
and a random randoms randomize the the

293
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:45,360
sample right and increase the sum to try

294
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:48,560
to incor to to to add to the to the to

295
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:51,120
the selection another ER another context

296
00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:54,278
another Farmers

297
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:58,399
right the plant breeders of course they

298
00:14:54,278 --> 00:15:00,078
have the favorite Varity at this part at

299
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:02,839
the end

300
00:15:00,078 --> 00:15:06,399
a I'm going to tell you that the name is

301
00:15:02,839 --> 00:15:09,880
the the SEF 64 that is the the name of

302
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:13,600
that that that material but we have five

303
00:15:09,879 --> 00:15:14,399
right and they discard is that the right

304
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:18,240
they

305
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:23,159
discard they have the top and the last

306
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:24,198
one was the se71 right so we we we give

307
00:15:23,159 --> 00:15:26,319
this

308
00:15:24,198 --> 00:15:29,120
recommendation a small recommendation a

309
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:32,399
simple recommendation to this to this to

310
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:34,679
these H colleagues just to to prove we

311
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:37,519
know some things about the context that

312
00:15:34,679 --> 00:15:39,039
the market Chang a little bit we we

313
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:41,639
studied

314
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:44,599
this before this this recommendation of

315
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:47,399
course because this St money there is a

316
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:51,480
lot of budget in this in this

317
00:15:47,399 --> 00:15:52,480
process ER and we have the collaboration

318
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:55,839
of course

319
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:57,959
the a um a student of PhD of Cornell

320
00:15:55,839 --> 00:16:03,680
that is Sergio Puerto I have to to add

321
00:15:57,958 --> 00:16:08,758
this information sorry but ER in this um

322
00:16:03,679 --> 00:16:11,159
in this group we realize that um H we

323
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:14,600
made that the procedure we made the we

324
00:16:11,159 --> 00:16:16,719
use the triot method that is a triadic

325
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:18,959
comparation of Technology at the end is

326
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:23,240
a massive evaluation we made this

327
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:26,239
process in 400 fields in Costa Rica in

328
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:30,399
the two region of commercial

329
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:33,360
production and erh at the end of this

330
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:38,159
this process we we know that the

331
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:44,240
favorite of and the the aage favorite um

332
00:16:38,159 --> 00:16:47,559
Varity was the se71 right that uh how to

333
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:52,318
say that the difference between the

334
00:16:47,559 --> 00:16:55,039
people who the plant breed right ER we

335
00:16:52,318 --> 00:16:58,240
Pro our hypothesis because the market

336
00:16:55,039 --> 00:17:02,719
changed a little bit in Costa Rica and

337
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:05,160
in in the last 10 years because the

338
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:10,160
government

339
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:11,319
um the government ER go to the market

340
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:15,720
and

341
00:17:11,318 --> 00:17:18,879
buy common bin for the ER company of the

342
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:23,199
of the government right you know ER

343
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:25,559
hospitals uh schools all so they the

344
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:27,480
government was part an important part of

345
00:17:25,558 --> 00:17:28,960
the market right and they changed a

346
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:32,000
little bit

347
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:35,038
conditions in the past the condition was

348
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:38,640
the industry put his opinion over the

349
00:17:35,038 --> 00:17:42,440
trait that the farmer select right we

350
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:45,080
know this with a small H

351
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:46,880
quality sessions

352
00:17:45,079 --> 00:17:51,678
so

353
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:55,000
er we want to know that H and we we we

354
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:56,798
received this this feedback so of course

355
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,919
H this is

356
00:17:56,798 --> 00:18:02,440
a a a

357
00:17:58,919 --> 00:18:05,919
it's not a structural situation it's a

358
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:10,000
um how to say that there is it's not a

359
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:13,759
structural is more specific a specific

360
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:17,119
ER situation right because ER it depend

361
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:21,480
of the government but they give know uh

362
00:18:17,119 --> 00:18:26,519
the this this process procedure give us

363
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:28,880
uh a feedback to select not one priority

364
00:18:26,519 --> 00:18:31,918
not two priorities one for the

365
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:35,799
government and the other one for the

366
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:37,440
industry there is two important markets

367
00:18:35,798 --> 00:18:39,599
and

368
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:44,360
that's

369
00:18:39,599 --> 00:18:48,158
a in the that's our experience a small

370
00:18:44,359 --> 00:18:51,279
change a decision randomize that's all

371
00:18:48,159 --> 00:18:58,440
what what we do change

372
00:18:51,279 --> 00:19:02,000
a um the the situation and now I I got

373
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:05,038
some information and this new Varity

374
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:07,599
that we released in this years we're

375
00:19:05,038 --> 00:19:10,519
expecting to re to to release the other

376
00:19:07,599 --> 00:19:14,158
one but this Varity that is for

377
00:19:10,519 --> 00:19:20,599
government er er they are starting very

378
00:19:14,159 --> 00:19:22,640
well ER like five ,000 of

379
00:19:20,599 --> 00:19:26,439
um

380
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:30,799
er I forgot the the measure

381
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:33,798
the five five th000

382
00:19:30,798 --> 00:19:33,798
um

383
00:19:34,599 --> 00:19:39,240
sorry the measure of no

384
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:48,159
it's no Quint qu thank you very much

385
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:51,640
5,000 Kint that that means like

386
00:19:48,159 --> 00:19:56,080
5,000 hectares is is planting this this

387
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:58,919
this new er er harvest season and for

388
00:19:56,079 --> 00:20:01,038
this this new Varity so that's our

389
00:19:58,919 --> 00:20:04,880
experience there is a small change that

390
00:20:01,038 --> 00:20:08,400
we that we introduce in our process and

391
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:10,080
make a difference in the results that is

392
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:13,000
my experience I don't know if you

393
00:20:10,079 --> 00:20:14,879
understand very well I'm sorry about my

394
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:19,038
rough English

395
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:23,520
but but I am glad if I send you the

396
00:20:19,038 --> 00:20:27,519
right message for our experience thank

397
00:20:23,519 --> 00:20:30,079
you yes yes yes thank you everyone once

398
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:32,759
again so now in advance my apologies

399
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:34,720
about my English also is not good um

400
00:20:32,759 --> 00:20:36,720
from the where I come from we don't

401
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:41,360
speak English we speak

402
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:45,519
Portuguese so C in MO most likely in

403
00:20:41,359 --> 00:20:48,000
southern region is a widely grown

404
00:20:45,519 --> 00:20:50,319
crop with with the time a lot of

405
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:53,599
research has been conducted on that crop

406
00:20:50,319 --> 00:20:57,158
which has result as well on variety

407
00:20:53,599 --> 00:20:59,199
release as well as aonic practice which

408
00:20:57,159 --> 00:21:02,480
related to those

409
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:06,798
but again the adoption rate either from

410
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:11,558
the varities or the AG agic practice or

411
00:21:06,798 --> 00:21:15,960
packages is not as as

412
00:21:11,558 --> 00:21:20,038
desired many factors can can can explain

413
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:21,840
that that reason but one of them is most

414
00:21:20,038 --> 00:21:24,640
likely lack

415
00:21:21,839 --> 00:21:28,158
of involvement within the

416
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:30,480
disciplines I mean social part of the

417
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:34,520
the research as well of the VAR

418
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:36,360
development itself I I I want say the

419
00:21:34,519 --> 00:21:40,079
breeding

420
00:21:36,359 --> 00:21:44,240
so as a study was conducted for Value

421
00:21:40,079 --> 00:21:48,599
chain analysis on on C value chain in in

422
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:52,519
mic so among various findings

423
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:55,038
that were generated from from that

424
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:58,400
stud one of the thing

425
00:21:55,038 --> 00:22:02,038
that it's really important that it has

426
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:05,640
helped to

427
00:22:02,038 --> 00:22:08,440
uh to improve I mean I could say the

428
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:11,679
integration of the social aspects on the

429
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:15,720
breeding component was that as a result

430
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:18,200
of that study was possible to

431
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:22,120
identify ER Market

432
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:26,360
segmentations according to the ER

433
00:22:22,119 --> 00:22:28,519
Farmers description and the traits of

434
00:22:26,359 --> 00:22:30,000
Interest or desired traits from from or

435
00:22:28,519 --> 00:22:32,519
prefer threat I think it's correct

436
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,759
prefer threat from from the

437
00:22:32,519 --> 00:22:37,599
farmer just to mention the market

438
00:22:34,759 --> 00:22:40,919
segmentations that the they were

439
00:22:37,599 --> 00:22:44,278
identified from that stud one is for dry

440
00:22:40,919 --> 00:22:47,440
grain for exportation okay that's one of

441
00:22:44,278 --> 00:22:50,640
the mark segmentation the second one is

442
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:54,840
also uh for food

443
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:58,880
processing okay and then the third one

444
00:22:54,839 --> 00:23:03,558
is more food security related which has

445
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:06,679
to do with the international for for

446
00:23:03,558 --> 00:23:09,399
international market as well as local

447
00:23:06,679 --> 00:23:13,038
consumption uh because this this third

448
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:17,080
one has comprised in terms of

449
00:23:13,038 --> 00:23:19,759
a traits that the the variety that

450
00:23:17,079 --> 00:23:22,720
respond to that market segmentation has

451
00:23:19,759 --> 00:23:28,000
to have dual purpose on which is

452
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:31,880
possible to get used from the lifs and

453
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:37,000
then get use of the poorts either uh

454
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:39,520
fresh pots and as well of grain grain

455
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:41,000
dry grain for from the international

456
00:23:39,519 --> 00:23:43,440
market

457
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:46,519
so with that

458
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:50,919
information ER the breeding the cop

459
00:23:46,519 --> 00:23:53,879
breeding program Now is working focus on

460
00:23:50,919 --> 00:23:56,880
those three Market segmentation in such

461
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:59,919
a way that the crossing blocks that have

462
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:02,400
been conducted as specifically to

463
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:06,038
respond to those to those MA

464
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:09,919
segmentation so the buing program has

465
00:24:06,038 --> 00:24:13,400
asper now uh if we go to the breeding

466
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:16,360
team they have got a Crossing block with

467
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:19,278
the parents identified to respond the

468
00:24:16,359 --> 00:24:20,199
mark segmentation one there is a Closs

469
00:24:19,278 --> 00:24:23,919
Crossing

470
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:26,600
block for the parents and the materials

471
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:29,559
uh that have been developed just to

472
00:24:26,599 --> 00:24:32,278
respond to math segment to and for the

473
00:24:29,558 --> 00:24:35,319
thir Market segmentation of course there

474
00:24:32,278 --> 00:24:38,960
are specific traes for each market

475
00:24:35,319 --> 00:24:40,480
segmentation for example for the as I

476
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:45,159
was saying for the mark segmentation

477
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:48,079
three that one of the the traes is a in

478
00:24:45,159 --> 00:24:52,159
terms of duration is a medium to short

479
00:24:48,079 --> 00:24:54,398
duration those are the tra has to be in

480
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:57,039
terms of seed color is important trait

481
00:24:54,398 --> 00:25:00,639
that came out from that St that stud is

482
00:24:57,038 --> 00:25:03,000
brown seed and as I said those are the

483
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:08,278
Vari for Dual Purpose on which the the

484
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:10,200
leaves can be used as well as the has

485
00:25:08,278 --> 00:25:13,240
the has the

486
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:17,319
pots and grain can be consumed either

487
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:21,919
fresh or dried when it reach for for d

488
00:25:17,319 --> 00:25:25,879
for the to respond to the export and

489
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:28,520
again just summarize just to to bring in

490
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:32,320
as an example on how

491
00:25:28,519 --> 00:25:35,319
the the activities or the result from

492
00:25:32,319 --> 00:25:38,720
the socio economic has impacted and

493
00:25:35,319 --> 00:25:42,319
directing the breeding program contrary

494
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:44,640
for from the past on which the approach

495
00:25:42,319 --> 00:25:47,678
was not necessarily guided for the

496
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:49,278
specific Market segment which are result

497
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:52,080
of a

498
00:25:49,278 --> 00:25:53,919
a a scientific Bas if I can call that

499
00:25:52,079 --> 00:25:58,119
way

500
00:25:53,919 --> 00:26:00,440
and as per now uh we believe that that

501
00:25:58,119 --> 00:26:02,519
that can be an strategy which can

502
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:07,000
improve the situation of

503
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:09,519
VAR of take or or or or R of adoption

504
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:12,679
this is also an experience okay for the

505
00:26:09,519 --> 00:26:16,440
purpose of this project is is is been

506
00:26:12,679 --> 00:26:20,440
done with C but there is experience

507
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:23,240
that our Institute wants to do across

508
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:28,519
other value chain or other commodity as

509
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:31,759
well uh so that the efforts resource uh

510
00:26:28,519 --> 00:26:35,000
properly directed in order to to

511
00:26:31,759 --> 00:26:38,119
immediately respond to the end users

512
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:41,519
needs or or preference so that's in

513
00:26:38,119 --> 00:26:42,959
short how what we can bring in to to

514
00:26:41,519 --> 00:26:46,558
share on

515
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:48,840
how or social aspect or or socio

516
00:26:46,558 --> 00:26:52,278
economic aspect if I can call that has

517
00:26:48,839 --> 00:26:56,319
impacted and directed The the breeding

518
00:26:52,278 --> 00:26:58,919
program and in MO specifical breeding

519
00:26:56,319 --> 00:27:00,119
program so one aspect that also comes

520
00:26:58,919 --> 00:27:02,240
out is not

521
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:07,079
necessarily with

522
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:10,919
the soci economy the interdisiplinary

523
00:27:07,079 --> 00:27:12,839
aspect has has has all that's one of the

524
00:27:10,919 --> 00:27:14,960
lessons that can come out because

525
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:17,240
there's a lot of

526
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:20,240
disciplines which I believe the goal is

527
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:22,120
the same to have a product that better

528
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:26,519
responds to the end

529
00:27:22,119 --> 00:27:28,158
users thank you very much right thank

530
00:27:26,519 --> 00:27:32,679
you

531
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:36,399
okay thank you very much um I would like

532
00:27:32,679 --> 00:27:42,080
to also share the experience from

533
00:27:36,398 --> 00:27:46,558
Uganda and um for us from our breeding

534
00:27:42,079 --> 00:27:50,038
program actually I can say that this is

535
00:27:46,558 --> 00:27:51,278
now a positive that we have changed from

536
00:27:50,038 --> 00:27:55,960
top

537
00:27:51,278 --> 00:27:59,558
down um reading approach to demand

538
00:27:55,960 --> 00:28:02,640
driven reading approach whereby we have

539
00:27:59,558 --> 00:28:06,398
to listen to our

540
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:09,559
customers and these customers I look we

541
00:28:06,398 --> 00:28:13,199
look at them uh through okay we follow

542
00:28:09,558 --> 00:28:17,359
the value chain at different we look at

543
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:22,000
different nodes what do producers want

544
00:28:17,359 --> 00:28:25,759
what do uh processors want Traders and

545
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:28,679
consumers so that I think by doing this

546
00:28:25,759 --> 00:28:31,079
we we can succeed that at the end of the

547
00:28:28,679 --> 00:28:33,798
day we shall come up with a product

548
00:28:31,079 --> 00:28:40,000
which is really demanded and the

549
00:28:33,798 --> 00:28:43,519
adoption rate will go high uh so uh what

550
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:46,919
we have done uh first of all we have

551
00:28:43,519 --> 00:28:50,399
mared all okay like the stakeholders

552
00:28:46,919 --> 00:28:51,919
along the value chain the Millet and

553
00:28:50,398 --> 00:28:55,839
soan value

554
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:58,720
chain uh we get to know who who are our

555
00:28:55,839 --> 00:29:02,639
customers what do they want want which

556
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:05,759
varieties are they interested in and why

557
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:08,640
so I think we have all these answers

558
00:29:05,759 --> 00:29:12,960
because we have already conducted the

559
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:14,880
the studies and we have the reports out

560
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:19,880
so after

561
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:25,640
that uh we conducted um we analyzed the

562
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:28,000
data and uh we came up with product

563
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:30,919
profiles uh we have

564
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:34,599
the targeted product profiles for the

565
00:29:30,919 --> 00:29:38,480
different market segments uh for example

566
00:29:34,599 --> 00:29:41,759
for sug we have three market segments

567
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:46,038
which we are following and uh this one

568
00:29:41,759 --> 00:29:49,798
we have Brewer rary industry we have the

569
00:29:46,038 --> 00:29:52,079
food industry and the beverage the soft

570
00:29:49,798 --> 00:29:55,918
drink so

571
00:29:52,079 --> 00:29:57,798
um uh the same applies to finger Millet

572
00:29:55,919 --> 00:30:02,640
because the way finger millet that is

573
00:29:57,798 --> 00:30:06,918
utilized is almost the same way so is

574
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:10,278
utilized so um now the product profiles

575
00:30:06,919 --> 00:30:13,600
we had to discuss the product profiles

576
00:30:10,278 --> 00:30:16,480
with the Breeders to agree because uh

577
00:30:13,599 --> 00:30:21,798
there are some you see like there are

578
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:24,960
some traits which are coming up strongly

579
00:30:21,798 --> 00:30:27,759
and uh yet breeders say we can't breed

580
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:30,079
for this but Farmers want them

581
00:30:27,759 --> 00:30:32,278
so we have to discuss and see what can

582
00:30:30,079 --> 00:30:37,439
we do for such

583
00:30:32,278 --> 00:30:39,798
cases um now uh after presenting this

584
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:42,759
actually we have the final product

585
00:30:39,798 --> 00:30:46,558
profiles which we shared with uh

586
00:30:42,759 --> 00:30:48,798
breeders the Breeders are using theyve

587
00:30:46,558 --> 00:30:51,678
already used these product Prof

588
00:30:48,798 --> 00:30:55,319
especially for finger Millet to select

589
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:58,320
because actually for us I thought at

590
00:30:55,319 --> 00:31:02,079
first that not until till the product

591
00:30:58,319 --> 00:31:05,000
profile is out that's when the breeding

592
00:31:02,079 --> 00:31:08,918
exercise will begin yet this the

593
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:12,079
Breeders already have their jum plasm so

594
00:31:08,919 --> 00:31:16,559
when you present this they will just

595
00:31:12,079 --> 00:31:20,199
select the varieties which align to to

596
00:31:16,558 --> 00:31:22,960
the traits which which Farmers or which

597
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:26,319
the different stakeholders need so they

598
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:27,919
have already selected this G plasm and

599
00:31:26,319 --> 00:31:32,879
we had to do

600
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:36,840
validation whereby um if we say for

601
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:41,880
example finger and soam are grown in

602
00:31:36,839 --> 00:31:46,599
specific areas of eastern northern and

603
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:47,519
western Uganda so uh you see like in

604
00:31:46,599 --> 00:31:50,879
each

605
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:53,919
region uh they they have different

606
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:57,960
traits which they prefer they are not

607
00:31:53,919 --> 00:32:01,919
the same so you find that there are some

608
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:04,440
traits which cut across the

609
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:07,120
regions um

610
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:10,240
now what we did we

611
00:32:07,119 --> 00:32:14,359
selected uh depending on the product

612
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:16,038
profiles the the jum plasm and evaluated

613
00:32:14,359 --> 00:32:19,119
them with the farmers

614
00:32:16,038 --> 00:32:21,278
still uh this time we didn't involve

615
00:32:19,119 --> 00:32:24,079
other stakeholders we haven't involved

616
00:32:21,278 --> 00:32:28,440
other stakeholders but we have evaluated

617
00:32:24,079 --> 00:32:32,359
with farmers and sincerely what Farmers

618
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:33,720
for them they they static actually how

619
00:32:32,359 --> 00:32:38,038
can I bring

620
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:41,679
it like their their choices don't keep

621
00:32:38,038 --> 00:32:45,079
changing because we all we all know that

622
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:47,960
their choices are Dynamic sometimes the

623
00:32:45,079 --> 00:32:50,480
consumers tell you today we need this

624
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:54,639
tomorrow they need another one but this

625
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:58,000
time around after validation we really

626
00:32:54,638 --> 00:33:03,000
it came out that there are

627
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:08,638
consistent in their choice selection so

628
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:10,798
um I think uh what now we have to do is

629
00:33:08,638 --> 00:33:13,839
to take out these

630
00:33:10,798 --> 00:33:15,879
varieties to the farmers and other

631
00:33:13,839 --> 00:33:18,959
stakeholders like the

632
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:22,600
consumers and the

633
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:25,639
processors uh the interesting bit as I

634
00:33:22,599 --> 00:33:28,959
said that uh

635
00:33:25,638 --> 00:33:31,798
breeders some sometimes they also have

636
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:33,000
their goals they have their objectives

637
00:33:31,798 --> 00:33:36,398
why they

638
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:39,839
breeding so this time

639
00:33:36,398 --> 00:33:42,798
around uh during the discussion AB will

640
00:33:39,839 --> 00:33:47,480
tell you yes you are telling me that um

641
00:33:42,798 --> 00:33:52,558
color is very important or

642
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:55,720
the uh there is a trait of is to thresh

643
00:33:52,558 --> 00:33:57,879
especially for for for finger Millet you

644
00:33:55,720 --> 00:34:03,000
know like finger Millet in Uganda we

645
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:05,360
call it a women's crop because uh men

646
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:08,440
don't like to to do it to cultivate

647
00:34:05,359 --> 00:34:12,398
finger Millet they say it's really hard

648
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:15,358
it is it has a lot of work and uh like

649
00:34:12,398 --> 00:34:18,719
when it comes to activities like

650
00:34:15,358 --> 00:34:22,000
weeding men don't like bending that's

651
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:25,719
over bending they say for them their

652
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:28,760
backs pain the women at least for them

653
00:34:25,719 --> 00:34:32,559
they can do that

654
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:36,599
so there are some traits which you think

655
00:34:32,559 --> 00:34:39,440
they they're not very important but when

656
00:34:36,599 --> 00:34:42,559
farmers are selecting these varieties

657
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:46,039
they really say we want a variety maybe

658
00:34:42,559 --> 00:34:51,119
which which which

659
00:34:46,039 --> 00:34:55,039
tills uh uh for reasons that it will

660
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:59,079
increase uh the production as well as

661
00:34:55,039 --> 00:35:01,440
also reduce on the work of over weeding

662
00:34:59,079 --> 00:35:04,480
like two three times so it suppresses

663
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:05,880
the what the weeds so some of these

664
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:09,199
traits and

665
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:11,800
then breeders say but this these are not

666
00:35:09,199 --> 00:35:14,598
important traits yes you are saying they

667
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:18,039
are not important but farmers will not

668
00:35:14,599 --> 00:35:22,920
will not adopt those varieties which you

669
00:35:18,039 --> 00:35:27,119
think are very important so um what I've

670
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:31,079
realized that we have to listen to our

671
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:32,079
customers if your target is maybe to

672
00:35:31,079 --> 00:35:36,119
breed

673
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:40,359
for the brewering company or you are

674
00:35:36,119 --> 00:35:43,680
breeding for food can can you listen to

675
00:35:40,358 --> 00:35:47,679
the customer who says I want a variety

676
00:35:43,679 --> 00:35:51,919
which tastes like like this because when

677
00:35:47,679 --> 00:35:55,799
you don't they will not adopt these

678
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:57,358
varieties uh we also realized during the

679
00:35:55,800 --> 00:36:00,160
the survey

680
00:35:57,358 --> 00:36:04,199
that um the variety the improved

681
00:36:00,159 --> 00:36:06,159
varieties out there are not known

682
00:36:04,199 --> 00:36:11,199
however sometimes you find that they

683
00:36:06,159 --> 00:36:13,879
already with Farmers but uh in case h

684
00:36:11,199 --> 00:36:16,239
takes a variety somewhere they will call

685
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:19,960
it hone they will not call

686
00:36:16,239 --> 00:36:23,078
it yeah so uh they are not aware someone

687
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:26,119
is like you mean we have improved ulate

688
00:36:23,079 --> 00:36:29,839
varieties so they are not aware that the

689
00:36:26,119 --> 00:36:31,640
our Vari is are out there so we need to

690
00:36:29,838 --> 00:36:34,838
do a lot of

691
00:36:31,639 --> 00:36:38,078
awareness uh to these

692
00:36:34,838 --> 00:36:41,279
Farmers so that I think they can the

693
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:44,880
demand can increase and this I think

694
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:49,119
affects the seed system if we don't do

695
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:52,800
so so um I think another thing which I

696
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:55,680
wanted to to share with you

697
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:58,680
[Music]

698
00:36:55,679 --> 00:36:58,679
um

699
00:37:00,159 --> 00:37:06,159
okay so

700
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:08,200
sorry too much to hear

701
00:37:06,159 --> 00:37:09,799
about I want to make sure we hear from

702
00:37:08,199 --> 00:37:12,318
EV and Simon too because we're running a

703
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:13,920
little bit low on time thank you um so

704
00:37:12,318 --> 00:37:15,519
to evine and Simon they they're really

705
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:17,920
deeply involved in Social inclusion

706
00:37:15,519 --> 00:37:19,519
related work so I just wanted to see why

707
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:22,838
is social inclusion important to your

708
00:37:19,519 --> 00:37:26,719
work and you could talk about okay thank

709
00:37:22,838 --> 00:37:29,440
you so much to for the floor I just want

710
00:37:26,719 --> 00:37:33,759
before I start to set a bit the scene I

711
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:36,079
started with Ina is almost now 11 years

712
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:38,680
when I started and I went to two

713
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:41,240
workshop and when I people will joke

714
00:37:38,679 --> 00:37:43,399
with you have you found what you are

715
00:37:41,239 --> 00:37:44,639
searching what are you doing I say I'm a

716
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:47,160
researcher have you found what you are

717
00:37:44,639 --> 00:37:49,440
searching and I look at the person and I

718
00:37:47,159 --> 00:37:51,078
don't know what to answer the second

719
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:54,440
thing they would they would continue and

720
00:37:51,079 --> 00:37:57,119
say oh like Sankar was saying researcher

721
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:58,800
who are searching we got them

722
00:37:57,119 --> 00:38:00,440
the researcher who are finding we are

723
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:04,880
still searching for

724
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:07,480
them so and then I was like wow so this

725
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:08,480
is the world where I am I am putting my

726
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:12,679
foot

727
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:16,159
in and and there was a kind of saying

728
00:38:12,679 --> 00:38:19,480
that we had Challenge and this was 2014

729
00:38:16,159 --> 00:38:24,000
we had a a big challenge because we had

730
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:26,159
lot of varieties piled in the shelves

731
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:28,280
and they're not moving I mean they don't

732
00:38:26,159 --> 00:38:31,000
go out

733
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:34,160
and we had like two or three story but

734
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:38,519
this was definitely real stories because

735
00:38:34,159 --> 00:38:40,799
at the beginning were like yeah you you

736
00:38:38,519 --> 00:38:42,559
close yourself in the lab you work hard

737
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:44,920
you come up with a variety because you

738
00:38:42,559 --> 00:38:48,318
think that my community is dying from

739
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:51,599
Hunger if I got a variety which can

740
00:38:48,318 --> 00:38:54,079
produce double of this because usually

741
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:56,720
it's half now if it this full they're

742
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:58,880
going to be happy and eat well and in

743
00:38:56,719 --> 00:39:01,279
the end of the day you get the variety

744
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:03,559
it will go there for one year next year

745
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:06,680
you go there every just doing like

746
00:39:03,559 --> 00:39:08,559
this or they will take it for respect

747
00:39:06,679 --> 00:39:11,199
because you bring bring it to them but

748
00:39:08,559 --> 00:39:15,039
they will never s it so it end up being

749
00:39:11,199 --> 00:39:17,639
cooked these are seeds or if not be

750
00:39:15,039 --> 00:39:20,559
cooked it will be probably sell to the

751
00:39:17,639 --> 00:39:21,318
market or given to because it's not what

752
00:39:20,559 --> 00:39:24,799
they're

753
00:39:21,318 --> 00:39:28,639
expecting so and I think this was quite

754
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:31,560
lessons that breeding team has learned

755
00:39:28,639 --> 00:39:33,400
and also and they realize that when I

756
00:39:31,559 --> 00:39:36,719
enter I think I had one colleague who

757
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:39,440
was a sociologist and another two in the

758
00:39:36,719 --> 00:39:40,759
center I was who were Economist and

759
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:44,519
other were doing the

760
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:47,119
PHD and it was like every it were like

761
00:39:44,519 --> 00:39:49,358
two World everyone is in the corner

762
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:54,599
trying to do whatever they're trying to

763
00:39:49,358 --> 00:39:57,799
do and we were call that is very urgent

764
00:39:54,599 --> 00:39:59,599
that instead of waiting to fail and then

765
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:01,560
you call you please come you did soci

766
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:03,838
sociology come come and help me to

767
00:40:01,559 --> 00:40:06,599
understand what is going on then you go

768
00:40:03,838 --> 00:40:08,799
you do the survey they say oh I mean we

769
00:40:06,599 --> 00:40:10,800
we don't like the this Crow because it's

770
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:14,480
too short the height is not what we

771
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:16,480
expecting or we need a market they need

772
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:18,079
to build a market for us and they will

773
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:20,519
go they will build the market and no one

774
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:24,000
is sitting in the market just because

775
00:40:20,519 --> 00:40:25,960
they turn the shops toward this and in

776
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:28,079
the culture if the shop is toward this

777
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:30,400
end it means that you are going to

778
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:33,800
collapse so nobody is going to use this

779
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:37,599
market so it was definitely a big time

780
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:41,000
that things are done in a very inclusive

781
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:44,280
way from the beginning which means we

782
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:46,760
should not leave anyone outside I used

783
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:50,359
to tell my colleagues that it's like the

784
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:52,760
body if your you got your little finger

785
00:40:50,358 --> 00:40:55,358
with a wound you will stay home for one

786
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:57,040
month and people say what why are you

787
00:40:55,358 --> 00:40:59,279
sick you say is your finger this little

788
00:40:57,039 --> 00:41:01,599
finger but it will collapse the whole

789
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:05,720
system and this was what was trying to

790
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:10,039
go on in in in in Era so it was a a

791
00:41:05,719 --> 00:41:11,838
right time that all or most of the I

792
00:41:10,039 --> 00:41:15,239
mean most of the

793
00:41:11,838 --> 00:41:18,119
projects try to be inclusive in the team

794
00:41:15,239 --> 00:41:20,318
first and then inclusive from the

795
00:41:18,119 --> 00:41:23,079
research perspective and this

796
00:41:20,318 --> 00:41:24,039
inclusivity has called us that when you

797
00:41:23,079 --> 00:41:27,280
go for

798
00:41:24,039 --> 00:41:29,480
research the community is such complex

799
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:32,400
like she was saying you know even in

800
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:34,199
bukina if you go to the north side you

801
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:36,800
get findings don't expect that you will

802
00:41:34,199 --> 00:41:39,239
find the same thing from the souff so it

803
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:42,760
means that you need to have a

804
00:41:39,239 --> 00:41:45,479
representative sample in all the process

805
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:46,440
if the variety has to be used for

806
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:48,719
different

807
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:50,519
communities or alternatively is you

808
00:41:48,719 --> 00:41:53,358
focus in one community and you need to

809
00:41:50,519 --> 00:41:55,800
be the most inclusive possible which is

810
00:41:53,358 --> 00:41:56,799
first the value chain so usually we are

811
00:41:55,800 --> 00:42:01,560
focusing

812
00:41:56,800 --> 00:42:04,318
on Farmers a processors

813
00:42:01,559 --> 00:42:07,159
Traders and because farmers are at the

814
00:42:04,318 --> 00:42:09,639
same time consumers so and in the

815
00:42:07,159 --> 00:42:11,519
farming perspective you have to be

816
00:42:09,639 --> 00:42:14,358
inclusive because the point of view of

817
00:42:11,519 --> 00:42:16,400
the woman who is cooking to appreciate

818
00:42:14,358 --> 00:42:19,598
his specific variety is different from

819
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:21,720
the man who don't go next to the kitchen

820
00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:24,318
but this is our culture if you see a man

821
00:42:21,719 --> 00:42:28,239
in the kitchen there's a problem either

822
00:42:24,318 --> 00:42:31,880
he's so modernized or he's

823
00:42:28,239 --> 00:42:33,358
sick so these are yeah so it's it's not

824
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:35,838
usual that he's standing in the kitchen

825
00:42:33,358 --> 00:42:38,318
trying to to cook and the Millet is not

826
00:42:35,838 --> 00:42:40,159
getting ready and he's struggling no he

827
00:42:38,318 --> 00:42:42,358
not so but when a woman is talking to

828
00:42:40,159 --> 00:42:45,279
you about a variety she's made go in

829
00:42:42,358 --> 00:42:47,598
details so we need to go on board with

830
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:51,200
the woman to understand the challenge

831
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:54,680
she's facing toward a specific crop like

832
00:42:51,199 --> 00:42:56,279
Millet or Ci or S but also you need to

833
00:42:54,679 --> 00:43:00,078
have the view of the man because he's

834
00:42:56,280 --> 00:43:03,559
the head of the household and also I

835
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:05,960
mean we use not to interview a people

836
00:43:03,559 --> 00:43:07,680
who are younger than 14 because you say

837
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:09,760
oh the founder would say that you are

838
00:43:07,679 --> 00:43:12,399
doing child abuse talking about the

839
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:15,400
Farms but most of the time they doing

840
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:17,920
the work behind so having their point of

841
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:21,119
view is very crucial because most of

842
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:24,000
they not only consuming but also they

843
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:26,720
the hardworking people with the moms in

844
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:28,880
the farm without being seen properly

845
00:43:26,719 --> 00:43:31,078
so the challenge sometimes either

846
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:33,720
Challenge from harvesting or Challenge

847
00:43:31,079 --> 00:43:36,318
from picking the crops or the color is

848
00:43:33,719 --> 00:43:38,679
changing if you're not on the F you

849
00:43:36,318 --> 00:43:40,920
cannot appreciate it so the inclusivity

850
00:43:38,679 --> 00:43:44,279
of the community in looking at what are

851
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:49,559
the preferences is very crucial for sure

852
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:51,079
it makes the work very long long process

853
00:43:49,559 --> 00:43:53,519
because in the end of the day you find

854
00:43:51,079 --> 00:43:55,800
yourself with a diversity of point of

855
00:43:53,519 --> 00:43:58,318
view and then what we are trying to do

856
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:59,200
in that we have what we call the nice to

857
00:43:58,318 --> 00:44:02,358
have

858
00:43:59,199 --> 00:44:05,078
threats they must have threats which

859
00:44:02,358 --> 00:44:08,519
means in in the end of the whole process

860
00:44:05,079 --> 00:44:11,200
of collecting information in the in the

861
00:44:08,519 --> 00:44:13,318
field and sometimes as well sorry to say

862
00:44:11,199 --> 00:44:15,679
it because I consider also breeders as

863
00:44:13,318 --> 00:44:17,960
part of my participants so I do

864
00:44:15,679 --> 00:44:21,358
interview with them without telling them

865
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:22,800
what I'm looking for as as information

866
00:44:21,358 --> 00:44:24,598
but when you are sharing back

867
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:26,599
information with them they realize that

868
00:44:24,599 --> 00:44:29,400
some of these things are coming from me

869
00:44:26,599 --> 00:44:31,359
but it makes sense in the whole thing

870
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:34,039
because they are completely part of the

871
00:44:31,358 --> 00:44:36,639
work by being by working in the lab so

872
00:44:34,039 --> 00:44:39,519
is very good to include them sometime as

873
00:44:36,639 --> 00:44:42,159
participant in the in the survey so

874
00:44:39,519 --> 00:44:45,159
having said so and when we have the M

875
00:44:42,159 --> 00:44:46,558
have threat depending on the amount of

876
00:44:45,159 --> 00:44:49,000
money because sometimes they cannot

877
00:44:46,559 --> 00:44:52,680
breed for everything they will tell me

878
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:56,199
elyn I'm tired I say yes me too I'm

879
00:44:52,679 --> 00:44:58,598
tired and I want you to tell me one two

880
00:44:56,199 --> 00:45:01,799
three things I need to put and breath

881
00:44:58,599 --> 00:45:04,838
for and I will tell him if if I tell you

882
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:06,559
the color yellow color is it enough he

883
00:45:04,838 --> 00:45:08,519
say yes but I say it's not enough the

884
00:45:06,559 --> 00:45:10,960
yellow you got in your mind might not be

885
00:45:08,519 --> 00:45:13,280
the yellow the farmers is telling me so

886
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:15,159
you see how complex it is you may have

887
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:17,800
light yellow in your mind and you go and

888
00:45:15,159 --> 00:45:20,440
breath light yellow and this perhaps

889
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:24,000
their totem is light yellow they want

890
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:26,960
dark yellow so even by saying the color

891
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:29,079
itself it's a big issue inside that you

892
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:31,199
have to investigate and in the end of

893
00:45:29,079 --> 00:45:33,720
the day when you we we are able to have

894
00:45:31,199 --> 00:45:38,279
the M have threat we have all to go on

895
00:45:33,719 --> 00:45:40,879
the field and be able to to validate the

896
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:44,319
type of yellow yellowness I don't know

897
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:46,720
exist or the type of redness or Darkness

898
00:45:44,318 --> 00:45:49,239
so that we are all even if I don't call

899
00:45:46,719 --> 00:45:51,159
it yellow at least I know what it means

900
00:45:49,239 --> 00:45:54,318
but this is still visible when you talk

901
00:45:51,159 --> 00:45:57,440
about t this is and they will tell you

902
00:45:54,318 --> 00:46:00,639
we want copy which t of like our local

903
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:03,519
variety I look at them and I'm sitting

904
00:46:00,639 --> 00:46:05,960
collecting this data and I'm working in

905
00:46:03,519 --> 00:46:08,838
my mind what is this kind of CI which

906
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:10,480
taste like the local variety so sometime

907
00:46:08,838 --> 00:46:13,358
I need to tell them can you bring me a

908
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:16,280
handful of it at least if I have a

909
00:46:13,358 --> 00:46:20,159
sample by talking about wish taste I can

910
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:23,559
show them this is it which means the bre

911
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:26,399
need to even tast it I don't know but at

912
00:46:23,559 --> 00:46:28,359
least and these are some of the

913
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:30,599
information or the inclusiveness

914
00:46:28,358 --> 00:46:33,078
strategy we are putting in place to be

915
00:46:30,599 --> 00:46:36,240
able to move forward so I just want to

916
00:46:33,079 --> 00:46:40,440
say that there is no one size fit all

917
00:46:36,239 --> 00:46:44,039
because every single a I mean variety or

918
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:46,679
every single Community is a very complex

919
00:46:44,039 --> 00:46:48,800
I mean community that you need to take

920
00:46:46,679 --> 00:46:51,039
if in the end of the day we want it to

921
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:54,318
be successful there is no waste of time

922
00:46:51,039 --> 00:46:56,920
in lab work and field work so that we

923
00:46:54,318 --> 00:46:58,159
all move uh in the same same direction

924
00:46:56,920 --> 00:47:01,480
and the last

925
00:46:58,159 --> 00:47:01,480
thing little

926
00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:07,760
bit the last thing well I leave it for

927
00:47:06,199 --> 00:47:10,960
the question side if they ask question I

928
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:14,960
will add it yeah please thank you thank

929
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:17,400
you har uh in the project in Kenya we

930
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:20,039
are working on social inclusion uh

931
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:23,200
social inclusion is one of the

932
00:47:20,039 --> 00:47:25,119
fundamental international human rights

933
00:47:23,199 --> 00:47:26,919
where development agriculture

934
00:47:25,119 --> 00:47:29,680
development project

935
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:32,680
need to for them to be inclusive they

936
00:47:29,679 --> 00:47:35,919
need to bring on board the women the

937
00:47:32,679 --> 00:47:38,919
youth and other marginalized groups

938
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:40,280
through a project supported by ELC we

939
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:42,639
are working with these other

940
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:45,519
marginalized groups and these are groups

941
00:47:42,639 --> 00:47:48,598
which have never been thought about we

942
00:47:45,519 --> 00:47:51,280
call them forgotten Farmers uh who who

943
00:47:48,599 --> 00:47:53,280
are rarely targeted by development

944
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:56,160
programs we are working with the Widow

945
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:57,760
Farmers farmers who are widos we are

946
00:47:56,159 --> 00:47:59,920
working with the farmers who are living

947
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:02,240
with HIV AIDS we are working with

948
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:04,240
Farmers living with disability we are

949
00:48:02,239 --> 00:48:07,479
working with the farmers who are single

950
00:48:04,239 --> 00:48:10,679
mothers under 35 years we are working

951
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:15,480
with the youth and we are also working

952
00:48:10,679 --> 00:48:20,358
with the farmers who are caregivers of

953
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:22,960
infants now these groups uh even as in

954
00:48:20,358 --> 00:48:26,000
our research program in our research

955
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:28,519
organization we've never reached them

956
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:31,318
but through ilc we are now having a

957
00:48:28,519 --> 00:48:33,960
project which we are calling uh Last

958
00:48:31,318 --> 00:48:36,279
Mile connectivity so that we can be able

959
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:39,000
to reach these groups with the

960
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:41,440
innovations that come from

961
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:43,880
breeders the context of these groups is

962
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:46,519
that they live in

963
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:48,559
marginalization they live in poverty

964
00:48:46,519 --> 00:48:52,000
they live in

965
00:48:48,559 --> 00:48:55,960
exclusion uh they've never been able to

966
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:59,838
use Innovations from breeders so in a

967
00:48:55,960 --> 00:49:04,199
baseline survey that uh we we carried

968
00:48:59,838 --> 00:49:07,519
out we wanted to understand uh their

969
00:49:04,199 --> 00:49:09,519
situation and in order to improve their

970
00:49:07,519 --> 00:49:14,199
livelihoods through the new

971
00:49:09,519 --> 00:49:16,759
Innovations so uh the the Stak we are

972
00:49:14,199 --> 00:49:20,480
working through a stakeholder platform

973
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:22,680
that involves public and private sector

974
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:25,679
actors in order to improve the

975
00:49:22,679 --> 00:49:30,358
livelihood of these groups using new in

976
00:49:25,679 --> 00:49:31,519
vers of high high ion Rich high iron and

977
00:49:30,358 --> 00:49:34,880
zinc Rich

978
00:49:31,519 --> 00:49:37,679
beans the bean is called Bean you can

979
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:41,798
Google you'll see it it has high iron

980
00:49:37,679 --> 00:49:44,519
and zinc which is quite useful in terms

981
00:49:41,798 --> 00:49:46,759
of nutrition for the type of groups that

982
00:49:44,519 --> 00:49:49,400
I mentioned the other the other

983
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:52,280
Innovation is the finger Millet which in

984
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:54,960
that region in Kenya is very important

985
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:58,720
for porridge as well as you know the St

986
00:49:54,960 --> 00:50:03,760
food then the final one is the the soam

987
00:49:58,719 --> 00:50:06,598
so uh these groups through support by

988
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:07,720
ilc we've been able to disseminate the

989
00:50:06,599 --> 00:50:11,160
three

990
00:50:07,719 --> 00:50:14,879
varieties these varieties uh after

991
00:50:11,159 --> 00:50:17,440
carrying out a rapid trait preferences

992
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:19,798
they wanted varieties which are climate

993
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:23,358
resilient meaning they are drought

994
00:50:19,798 --> 00:50:25,079
tolerant they are early maturing and in

995
00:50:23,358 --> 00:50:28,119
terms of beans they are gentle to the

996
00:50:25,079 --> 00:50:30,440
stomach most people don't pref don't

997
00:50:28,119 --> 00:50:34,000
like eating beans because they have

998
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:36,200
problems the stomach so we selected the

999
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:40,880
this variety because it is a flatlet

1000
00:50:36,199 --> 00:50:45,078
free and then in terms of in terms of

1001
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:48,039
millet uh the the porridge is is quite

1002
00:50:45,079 --> 00:50:50,599
quite sweet the groups have already gone

1003
00:50:48,039 --> 00:50:53,960
through the first season they've grown

1004
00:50:50,599 --> 00:50:56,480
their varieties and we recently carried

1005
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:58,760
out a food festival

1006
00:50:56,480 --> 00:51:01,440
and it was very encouraging to see how

1007
00:50:58,760 --> 00:51:04,160
products from breeders can be able to

1008
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:06,240
transform uh the nutrition of these

1009
00:51:04,159 --> 00:51:10,000
disadvantaged groups in this food

1010
00:51:06,239 --> 00:51:13,798
festival we carried out it out with the

1011
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:16,159
uh groups Farmers living the HIV and

1012
00:51:13,798 --> 00:51:19,719
their children and they had a meal

1013
00:51:16,159 --> 00:51:22,759
together of finger Millet porridge from

1014
00:51:19,719 --> 00:51:26,159
the Breeders as well as the high zinc

1015
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:29,799
and ion Rich bean and uh

1016
00:51:26,159 --> 00:51:32,239
uh their feedback was that in terms of

1017
00:51:29,798 --> 00:51:35,639
the beans this was the best Bean that

1018
00:51:32,239 --> 00:51:39,279
they have ever uh had before compared to

1019
00:51:35,639 --> 00:51:43,239
the local varieties and also in terms of

1020
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:44,480
SOA so uh this goes to underscore the

1021
00:51:43,239 --> 00:51:48,039
importance

1022
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:49,719
of uh breeding programs when they

1023
00:51:48,039 --> 00:51:54,440
appropriately

1024
00:51:49,719 --> 00:51:56,399
Target uh the the market segments so we

1025
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:57,639
think we think that that through this

1026
00:51:56,400 --> 00:52:02,280
stakeholder

1027
00:51:57,639 --> 00:52:05,000
program we are not only uh going to work

1028
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:07,480
on issues of food and nutrition security

1029
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:11,798
but also the issue of increasing the

1030
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:15,358
voice of these groups in society because

1031
00:52:11,798 --> 00:52:17,719
by that through their their conditions

1032
00:52:15,358 --> 00:52:20,480
uh one of the things that makes them

1033
00:52:17,719 --> 00:52:22,318
discriminated is that they do not have a

1034
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:26,400
platform to be able to increase their

1035
00:52:22,318 --> 00:52:29,039
voice in society so uh just want to say

1036
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:30,240
that breeding is very important in

1037
00:52:29,039 --> 00:52:34,480
feeding the

1038
00:52:30,239 --> 00:52:36,838
future uh but it's only one part of the

1039
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:39,280
equation the social scientists are very

1040
00:52:36,838 --> 00:52:41,639
important as well as the other the other

1041
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:44,960
stakeholders to be able so that we all

1042
00:52:41,639 --> 00:52:47,879
work together in a a world that leaves

1043
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:51,240
no one behind thank you

1044
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:53,358
wow it's a beautiful

1045
00:52:51,239 --> 00:52:55,919
end I know we're out of time but I'd

1046
00:52:53,358 --> 00:52:58,078
love to take some questions until we get

1047
00:52:55,920 --> 00:53:00,519
kicked out of the room so I think

1048
00:52:58,079 --> 00:53:02,839
there's a class after this okay right

1049
00:53:00,519 --> 00:53:05,039
now yeah we do have one question on the

1050
00:53:02,838 --> 00:53:09,960
mind so maybe in the room one question

1051
00:53:05,039 --> 00:53:09,960
we yeah should we start with the room

1052
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:18,519
any just need three more

1053
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:19,318
hours so the question from Leah about

1054
00:53:18,519 --> 00:53:21,559
for

1055
00:53:19,318 --> 00:53:25,000
Sophie so could you provide more

1056
00:53:21,559 --> 00:53:27,680
information on the step taken by Naro uh

1057
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:29,838
that ensure social economic aspects are

1058
00:53:27,679 --> 00:53:32,639
considered in a pre-breeding and early

1059
00:53:29,838 --> 00:53:32,639
breeding

1060
00:53:34,119 --> 00:53:39,640
programs within government funded

1061
00:53:37,239 --> 00:53:43,598
projects not donor funded

1062
00:53:39,639 --> 00:53:44,920
projects not Don government funding if

1063
00:53:43,599 --> 00:53:48,480
they are

1064
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:50,960
in so all Government funding project is

1065
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:55,639
that soal economic study considered in

1066
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:58,559
the pre-reading stage any step to okay

1067
00:53:55,639 --> 00:54:00,279
thank you so much uh the government

1068
00:53:58,559 --> 00:54:05,240
funded

1069
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:09,440
project I would say yes and

1070
00:54:05,239 --> 00:54:12,479
no because uh like in

1071
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:15,559
Uganda uh the funding we get from

1072
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:17,440
government for research is really

1073
00:54:15,559 --> 00:54:20,880
limited uh

1074
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:26,400
most okay funding we get it from

1075
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:29,920
donors however as I said before that uh

1076
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:33,039
before we were considering that top

1077
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:35,358
down uh research

1078
00:54:33,039 --> 00:54:39,440
approach uh

1079
00:54:35,358 --> 00:54:43,400
whereby uh like if breeders get little

1080
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:47,119
money they have objectives like someone

1081
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:51,639
will say I'm breeding um I want to

1082
00:54:47,119 --> 00:54:55,358
improve on yield and not looking at

1083
00:54:51,639 --> 00:54:58,798
other issues now for example if if you

1084
00:54:55,358 --> 00:55:01,679
breed if you want to improve on yield of

1085
00:54:58,798 --> 00:55:03,599
a certain crop variety you are

1086
00:55:01,679 --> 00:55:07,679
forgetting that there are also other

1087
00:55:03,599 --> 00:55:11,200
issues even if you take this variety

1088
00:55:07,679 --> 00:55:16,118
which is high yielding and uh maybe it

1089
00:55:11,199 --> 00:55:19,960
is very tall and you are taking it to

1090
00:55:16,119 --> 00:55:24,760
areas for example in the Eastern region

1091
00:55:19,960 --> 00:55:27,639
they like medium height varieties so

1092
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:29,640
even believe it is high yielding because

1093
00:55:27,639 --> 00:55:32,318
the women are the one cultivating

1094
00:55:29,639 --> 00:55:37,358
someone will say that variety I can't do

1095
00:55:32,318 --> 00:55:41,679
what harest meaning you have to maybe

1096
00:55:37,358 --> 00:55:44,000
get men to help you and Men actually

1097
00:55:41,679 --> 00:55:48,078
will be enjoying their

1098
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:51,798
bre they they're not bothered so as a

1099
00:55:48,079 --> 00:55:55,920
woman you have to provide food at

1100
00:55:51,798 --> 00:55:58,798
home uh so I can say

1101
00:55:55,920 --> 00:56:03,639
no when I follow that

1102
00:55:58,798 --> 00:56:06,199
argument I can also say yes because um

1103
00:56:03,639 --> 00:56:09,679
after working with you say actually

1104
00:56:06,199 --> 00:56:10,879
things are changing in that the approach

1105
00:56:09,679 --> 00:56:15,199
is also

1106
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:17,599
changing for which is demand driven

1107
00:56:15,199 --> 00:56:21,439
whereby uh as social

1108
00:56:17,599 --> 00:56:23,680
Economist now at least we have a voice

1109
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:28,119
before we used to work in

1110
00:56:23,679 --> 00:56:31,279
silos uh a breeder is working alone and

1111
00:56:28,119 --> 00:56:34,200
even socio Economist the

1112
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:37,680
agronomists so you find that everything

1113
00:56:34,199 --> 00:56:39,279
is mixed up but right now uh now we are

1114
00:56:37,679 --> 00:56:42,239
working we are following the

1115
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:46,079
interdisciplinary approach whereby we

1116
00:56:42,239 --> 00:56:51,318
come together and discuss how to handle

1117
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:54,920
such issues so that I can say that it is

1118
00:56:51,318 --> 00:56:58,119
coming up and in case we get any

1119
00:56:54,920 --> 00:57:01,200
government funding we still have to

1120
00:56:58,119 --> 00:57:04,440
follow the the demand driven

1121
00:57:01,199 --> 00:57:04,439
approach thank

1122
00:57:04,559 --> 00:57:09,720
you I don't know answer that question

1123
00:57:12,318 --> 00:57:17,920
yes last

1124
00:57:15,358 --> 00:57:20,279
chance all right can you please help me

1125
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:20,280
than

1126
