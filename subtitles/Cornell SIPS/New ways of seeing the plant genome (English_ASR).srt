1
00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:04,440
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:16,359
University let's talk about genomes so

3
00:00:13,638 --> 00:00:18,320
uh frany said she when I met her just a

4
00:00:16,359 --> 00:00:20,840
little while ago she said she likes to

5
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,439
work with things she can see and so you

6
00:00:20,839 --> 00:00:26,320
know who wants to work with DNA which

7
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:28,679
you can't see so um the problem of

8
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,240
seeing the DNA is really important for

9
00:00:28,678 --> 00:00:33,479
understanding how the genome works and

10
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:35,960
so we're talk going to talk about data

11
00:00:33,479 --> 00:00:38,238
visualization so uh before I start I'd

12
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:40,039
like to just some of you may have missed

13
00:00:38,238 --> 00:00:43,640
it but in the beginning of September

14
00:00:40,039 --> 00:00:45,079
there was a major scientific Advance 30

15
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:46,960
Publications were published

16
00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:49,759
simultaneously in science nature and

17
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:52,520
other journals uh which is the fruit

18
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:55,280
coming out of the encode project and the

19
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:58,359
latest phase of the encode project and

20
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:00,879
so this was a paradigm shifting uh

21
00:00:58,359 --> 00:01:02,359
outcome and it it it says something

22
00:01:00,878 --> 00:01:04,798
about the genome which I'd really like

23
00:01:02,359 --> 00:01:08,000
to communicate to you the leader of this

24
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:10,240
this vast Consortium of scientists uh

25
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,799
something like several I think over a

26
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:14,359
hundred scientists who were part of the

27
00:01:11,799 --> 00:01:17,000
Consortium over aund million doar spent

28
00:01:14,359 --> 00:01:18,840
on this it's basically phase three of

29
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,078
the Genome Project you know once you

30
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:21,719
have a genome you have to figure out

31
00:01:20,078 --> 00:01:23,279
what it's doing and so they've been

32
00:01:21,719 --> 00:01:25,319
trying to understand what what the

33
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,960
genome does this is what the leader of

34
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:31,000
program said he said the genome is a

35
00:01:27,959 --> 00:01:33,078
jungle of information is multi-layered

36
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
and multi-dimensional and that higher

37
00:01:33,078 --> 00:01:38,078
genomes are mostly functional a major

38
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,599
major paradigm shift in terms of

39
00:01:38,078 --> 00:01:44,839
understanding of the genome and so uh

40
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:46,359
the bottom line is that not only does we

41
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:48,240
usually think of the genetic code you

42
00:01:46,359 --> 00:01:50,280
know the code that goes from DNA to RNA

43
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:53,000
to protein well that only accounts for 1

44
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:55,439
to 2% of the genome there are many other

45
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,680
codes many many codes in the genome many

46
00:01:55,438 --> 00:02:00,359
languages and they overlap and if you

47
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:02,240
ask a computer scientist if they could

48
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:04,319
write overlapping code they would just

49
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:07,399
you know their eyes would go crossed so

50
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:09,399
this is uh this is a amazing reality but

51
00:02:07,399 --> 00:02:13,120
it it it suggests that understanding The

52
00:02:09,399 --> 00:02:14,800
genome will be the challenge for the uh

53
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,800
people who raised their hand who were

54
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:19,840
born before uh 1980 this is that

55
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:22,439
generation's challenge to figure out

56
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:24,519
what in the world is going on inside the

57
00:02:22,439 --> 00:02:26,639
genome and what they've discovered so

58
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:29,159
far most people acknowledge is just the

59
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:33,399
tip of the iceberg so how do you try to

60
00:02:29,159 --> 00:02:34,878
even approach all this uh new data I

61
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:37,800
just like to tell you about what data

62
00:02:34,878 --> 00:02:40,079
visualization is it's an area of science

63
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:41,840
it's uh here's the bottom line the best

64
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:46,319
pattern recognition software in the

65
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:48,719
universe is our brain and so uh you can

66
00:02:46,318 --> 00:02:50,238
program a computer to look for a pattern

67
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:52,800
but it'll only look for the pattern you

68
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:54,480
asked it to look for whereas our brain

69
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,519
everything we look our brain

70
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:59,799
automatically recognizes patterns and so

71
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:01,039
that's um that's something that is

72
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:02,519
unique to the human brain they still

73
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:04,598
haven't developed a computer that can

74
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:08,360
recognize a face for

75
00:03:04,598 --> 00:03:11,598
example so data visualization is the is

76
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:14,920
the um involves the process of making

77
00:03:11,598 --> 00:03:16,919
data Visual and when it's visual then

78
00:03:14,919 --> 00:03:19,958
our brain can take over and easily

79
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:22,919
recognize patterns and that's the origin

80
00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:25,560
of this program called Skittle and so if

81
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:28,479
you look some of you have seen uh

82
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:30,959
genomic data and it's just endless A's

83
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:32,560
T's C's and G's you will find that your

84
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:34,080
brain can't really you know when you

85
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,519
look at a few million of those your

86
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:38,319
brain doesn't see any pattern if you do

87
00:03:36,519 --> 00:03:40,959
something as simple as adding color to

88
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:43,479
the scheme you can start to see patterns

89
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:45,360
and so um Skittle the first first

90
00:03:43,479 --> 00:03:47,000
dimension of Skittle is simple

91
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:50,519
colorization of

92
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,519
nucleotides so

93
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:55,640
um I've

94
00:03:52,878 --> 00:03:58,280
suggested now for the people in Geneva

95
00:03:55,639 --> 00:04:01,719
I'm just going to take a minute and show

96
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:03,199
them some live uh running of the program

97
00:04:01,719 --> 00:04:05,878
and I'd be happy to share it with you

98
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:08,479
when I'm back up in Geneva uh maybe next

99
00:04:05,878 --> 00:04:11,280
week but uh bear with me just for a

100
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:13,199
moment and I'm going to escape this and

101
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:17,478
close

102
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:19,560
this and I'm going to pull up Skittle

103
00:04:17,478 --> 00:04:24,599
program whoops that's not the one I

104
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:27,800
wanted there it is okay so this is a and

105
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:32,280
maybe maybe the people in Geneva can see

106
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:35,520
this but this is display of

107
00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:38,279
40,000 approximately 40,000

108
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:41,279
pixels and each pixel represents a

109
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:43,758
nucleotide so the this is chromosome 10

110
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:46,239
of corn and the first pixel is green

111
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:47,720
meaning it's a guanine okay so you're

112
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,560
looking at

113
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:53,880
40,000 letters but because it's

114
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:55,959
colorized you can start to see patterns

115
00:04:53,879 --> 00:04:58,159
and so uh over here the way Skittle

116
00:04:55,959 --> 00:05:00,000
works is there's basic settings at the

117
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:02,639
top you can determine the width WID of

118
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:06,319
this you can determine zoom in and zoom

119
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:08,680
out you can do uh determine go Zoom to

120
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:10,918
any starting point you want there's ways

121
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:13,879
of bringing in new data like from a

122
00:05:10,918 --> 00:05:15,680
genome browser and there there are basic

123
00:05:13,879 --> 00:05:18,240
functions that will be can be tied to

124
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:20,038
your mouth and then over here there are

125
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:22,400
different

126
00:05:20,038 --> 00:05:24,599
displays so right now we're looking at a

127
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:27,879
simple nucleotide display so this is raw

128
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:31,120
data this is the data uh it's just the

129
00:05:27,879 --> 00:05:34,000
the data as a genome as a fastop file

130
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:35,519
colorized

131
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,879
so

132
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:41,240
the let me just show

133
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:44,120
you what's the gray the gray are

134
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:44,120
unsequenced

135
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:51,038
gaps so let's just see what we can do

136
00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:54,038
here um one of the things we can do is

137
00:05:51,038 --> 00:05:56,680
we can change a d diameter you can

138
00:05:54,038 --> 00:06:00,279
perhaps see that I'm making it

139
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:03,240
narrower and if I close if I change it

140
00:06:00,279 --> 00:06:06,079
enough you see a new pattern so

141
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:09,120
basically these are tandem

142
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:10,439
repeats and if I said I love you I love

143
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:13,840
you I love you I love you that's a

144
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:16,560
tandem repeat and if you have a a line

145
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:18,439
break after the U every time all the

146
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,399
letters of I love you I love you will

147
00:06:18,439 --> 00:06:22,360
line up and you'll get these columns

148
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:23,638
straight up and down columns right so

149
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:26,879
that's what you're seeing here is a

150
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:30,439
tandem repeat and this is a large tandem

151
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:33,038
repeat and it's throughout the the corn

152
00:06:30,439 --> 00:06:36,399
genome it's especially abundant in the

153
00:06:33,038 --> 00:06:38,439
centr region and it's uh but it's

154
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:41,239
throughout the genome it may represent 5

155
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:42,918
or 10% of the genome so it's a major

156
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:45,918
element and if I told you talked about

157
00:06:42,918 --> 00:06:48,478
TM repeats without a visualization you

158
00:06:45,918 --> 00:06:50,399
wouldn't immediately get it when you see

159
00:06:48,478 --> 00:06:51,918
a picture of it it's really obvious

160
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:54,478
isn't

161
00:06:51,918 --> 00:06:57,680
it okay so

162
00:06:54,478 --> 00:06:59,120
um that just I'm going to jump back to

163
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:03,519
the PowerPoint for the sake of the

164
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:06,240
people at Geneva but um but perhaps that

165
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:06,240
is helpful to

166
00:07:14,598 --> 00:07:17,918
you

167
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:20,759
okay

168
00:07:17,918 --> 00:07:22,318
so people at Geneva I'd be happy just

169
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:26,840
ask me and I'll show you how Skittle

170
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:28,720
Works later um okay this is a picture of

171
00:07:26,839 --> 00:07:30,439
the cor genome and I like it because it

172
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:34,759
shows a couple things that are very

173
00:07:30,439 --> 00:07:37,719
significant one is uh it shows the

174
00:07:34,759 --> 00:07:40,840
um the very different nucleotide

175
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:43,280
percentages there are areas that are GC

176
00:07:40,839 --> 00:07:44,799
rich and there are areas that are at

177
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:48,079
Rich and sometimes you have areas that

178
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:49,800
are cusing rich they're mostly red and

179
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:52,318
and so you have

180
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:55,199
um it's not you might picture it as a

181
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:58,280
uniform blend but actually there's these

182
00:07:55,199 --> 00:08:01,240
huge variations this these areas that

183
00:07:58,279 --> 00:08:03,758
are GC rich are where the genes are so

184
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:05,120
these are genic regions and if you look

185
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:07,319
really carefully you'll see a tanm

186
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:09,000
repeat here and a tanm repeat at the

187
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:10,319
beginning of the end of this Gene so

188
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:14,879
let's just look at that a little more

189
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:18,960
carefully um this is a similar tandem

190
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:20,840
this is a similar genic region and uh

191
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:23,719
you can see there's a couple of things

192
00:08:20,839 --> 00:08:25,359
one one is it's GC Rich another thing is

193
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:27,479
that if you look really carefully in

194
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:30,319
here you'll see a

195
00:08:27,478 --> 00:08:32,799
texture which is called a which which we

196
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:35,240
call the threer pattern but that

197
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:38,918
reflects codon preference in other words

198
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:40,839
you can recognize protein coding regions

199
00:08:38,918 --> 00:08:43,360
okay I'm sorry I haven't explained what

200
00:08:40,839 --> 00:08:46,080
this new display is this is the repeat

201
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:49,200
map so if you have a light colored pixel

202
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:51,720
here that means that a string this long

203
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:54,399
has repeated once if you have a series

204
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:56,040
of pixels here that means you can see it

205
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:58,759
correlates with this repeat here where

206
00:08:56,039 --> 00:09:01,159
these are lining up so this is a very

207
00:08:58,759 --> 00:09:03,919
very sensitive map of repeating units

208
00:09:01,159 --> 00:09:07,159
within the genome and it's it's much

209
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:09,759
more sensitive than any other uh genome

210
00:09:07,159 --> 00:09:12,439
tool for detecting repetition within the

211
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:14,000
genome and what you see here very

212
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:16,160
carefully if you look really carefully

213
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:20,759
is there's a pattern of dark dark light

214
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:23,639
dark dark light and uh that pattern is

215
00:09:20,759 --> 00:09:26,200
throughout the Genome of all organisms

216
00:09:23,639 --> 00:09:30,000
and it it represents the nature of the

217
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:32,278
protein coding uh the Cod on

218
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,519
preferences and what's significant here

219
00:09:32,278 --> 00:09:36,360
is that there's a tandm repeat at the

220
00:09:34,519 --> 00:09:39,600
beginning and the end of the genic

221
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:41,240
region and so that means that those tanm

222
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:44,079
repeats this is something you find

223
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:45,879
throughout the cor genome it is in

224
00:09:44,078 --> 00:09:48,439
thousands and thousands of places in the

225
00:09:45,879 --> 00:09:49,958
quino it means normally people have

226
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:52,880
always thought that tanm repeats are

227
00:09:49,958 --> 00:09:55,199
junk DNA they're just Pro mistakes that

228
00:09:52,879 --> 00:09:57,039
happen during DNA replication but what

229
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,759
we find is that these are strategically

230
00:09:57,039 --> 00:10:01,278
at the beginning and the end of these

231
00:09:58,759 --> 00:10:03,399
genic regions so they're not junk

232
00:10:01,278 --> 00:10:04,919
they're they're precisely where they're

233
00:10:03,399 --> 00:10:06,559
supposed to be and they always match

234
00:10:04,919 --> 00:10:08,159
they come in pairs they kind of

235
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:10,439
represent the beginning and the end of

236
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:13,799
the Exxon the Quin protein quoting

237
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:16,120
region the other interesting thing is um

238
00:10:13,799 --> 00:10:18,919
it's a little bit off scale here but we

239
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:23,440
we can look at where the annotated exons

240
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:25,399
recognized exons are and most of the

241
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,839
things we see with Skittle have never

242
00:10:25,399 --> 00:10:29,679
been described before in other words

243
00:10:26,839 --> 00:10:33,040
they've been invisible to the normal

244
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:34,239
Gene searches and so we're seeing uh

245
00:10:33,039 --> 00:10:38,199
functional

246
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:41,079
units within the genome that weren't

247
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:42,560
visible using other Technologies for

248
00:10:41,078 --> 00:10:45,439
analyzing

249
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:48,719
genomes so this is an example of a

250
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:50,880
similar similar genic region it's very

251
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:53,519
ATR you recognize it right away right

252
00:10:50,879 --> 00:10:55,559
it's very distinct here you can see the

253
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:58,000
the texture that I spoke of can you see

254
00:10:55,559 --> 00:10:59,838
that texture in the back that's that's

255
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,278
very distinctive of protein coding

256
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:04,480
regions and then you can see here this

257
00:11:02,278 --> 00:11:06,759
is called an xon track this is these

258
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:10,959
lines are just marking where there's a

259
00:11:06,759 --> 00:11:13,759
protein coding Exxon and what you see is

260
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:17,399
uh in this case this Exxon has been

261
00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:21,559
identified by previous researchers as a

262
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:23,919
a functional Gene genic unit but 99% of

263
00:11:21,559 --> 00:11:26,679
these structures that we see have not

264
00:11:23,919 --> 00:11:29,240
been identified previously as exons so

265
00:11:26,679 --> 00:11:31,919
we have a new way of of identifying

266
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:34,000
exons in any genome which is very

267
00:11:31,919 --> 00:11:36,519
sensitive and very

268
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,759
exciting uh just it's more of the same

269
00:11:36,519 --> 00:11:41,879
you can see a genic region That's What I

270
00:11:38,759 --> 00:11:44,360
Call bracketed by tandem repeats and the

271
00:11:41,879 --> 00:11:46,519
tanm repeats again are these are these

272
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:48,839
repeating

273
00:11:46,519 --> 00:11:51,440
units so that's uh that's really

274
00:11:48,839 --> 00:11:54,040
exciting here's a closer look at the T

275
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:56,760
this texture and you can actually see

276
00:11:54,039 --> 00:12:00,120
that the the the greenish yellow the

277
00:11:56,759 --> 00:12:02,838
guanines are lining up because this is a

278
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:05,159
very non-random this is the Exxon okay

279
00:12:02,839 --> 00:12:07,600
we know this is the Exxon we can see

280
00:12:05,159 --> 00:12:10,639
that it has the exonic signature and we

281
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:13,720
can actually see the In The Raw data we

282
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:16,959
can actually see that uh the the third

283
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:19,440
nucleotide tends to always be a g is

284
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:21,039
this a linear sequence on itself yeah

285
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,639
I'm sorry I should have expressed that

286
00:12:21,039 --> 00:12:24,799
it's like a book so you go to the end of

287
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:27,879
the line and go back to the beginning so

288
00:12:24,799 --> 00:12:29,639
it's rastered so

289
00:12:27,879 --> 00:12:32,838
um

290
00:12:29,639 --> 00:12:35,000
another question yes

291
00:12:32,839 --> 00:12:38,079
genome okay

292
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:40,159
so this display link this 88,000

293
00:12:38,078 --> 00:12:42,319
nucleotides are present in this picture

294
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:45,360
right here out of three

295
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:46,639
billion so um so you'd have thousands

296
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:49,879
and thousands and thousands and

297
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:52,278
thousands of pages like this oh my good

298
00:12:49,879 --> 00:12:54,439
so you can I've spent uh just looking at

299
00:12:52,278 --> 00:12:57,600
one chromosome you can spend hours and

300
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:59,199
just get a a few uh highlights of that

301
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:02,278
chromosome so there's a huge huge amount

302
00:12:59,198 --> 00:13:04,799
of data um this is again what we one of

303
00:13:02,278 --> 00:13:06,320
the things we can do is we can if we see

304
00:13:04,799 --> 00:13:08,319
a tandem repeat here we know there's a

305
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:11,120
tandm rep here because here's the repeat

306
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:14,160
map so now we have a new display if we

307
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:16,799
click on the first nucleotide of that

308
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:18,838
line what happens is it will take that

309
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:21,759
line and search the whole genome for

310
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:23,760
that sequence and color wherever the you

311
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:26,480
find it so this is basically just

312
00:13:23,759 --> 00:13:29,000
showing that yes this genic region is

313
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:30,800
flanked by tandem repeats at both sides

314
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,480
and the fact that it's the same color

315
00:13:30,799 --> 00:13:36,559
means it's the same

316
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:38,480
sequence so you can search um this is a

317
00:13:36,559 --> 00:13:40,559
similar one A different flanking

318
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:42,560
sequence and U now we're going to jump

319
00:13:40,559 --> 00:13:45,319
to Grape so that's just a the reason I

320
00:13:42,559 --> 00:13:47,439
used corn to begin with is this the only

321
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:49,120
plant genome I know of where I have the

322
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,920
Exxon track data where people have

323
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:53,278
actually figured out where the protein

324
00:13:50,919 --> 00:13:55,240
coating regions are but uh let's just

325
00:13:53,278 --> 00:13:58,120
consider another horticulturally

326
00:13:55,240 --> 00:14:00,600
important crop and that is uh the grape

327
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:02,639
genome and here again you can see very

328
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:05,079
distinct tandem repeat now you see there

329
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:07,360
are variations within the tandem repeat

330
00:14:05,078 --> 00:14:10,319
and the question could be asked is that

331
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:13,199
noise like mutations or is that actually

332
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:15,759
information these patterns uh often

333
00:14:13,198 --> 00:14:18,679
remind me of again ancient history when

334
00:14:15,759 --> 00:14:21,919
we had Punch Cards for computer analysis

335
00:14:18,679 --> 00:14:24,919
so uh and you can see how the repeat map

336
00:14:21,919 --> 00:14:26,719
very very uh easily detects this and

337
00:14:24,919 --> 00:14:29,838
also the how the repeat map is telling

338
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:33,000
us that right here there is an

339
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:35,399
on so visualization data visualization

340
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,360
is a powerful tool when you're exploring

341
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:38,919
the

342
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:41,959
unknown this is uh just more tandem

343
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:44,719
repeats uh some of them are you know

344
00:14:41,958 --> 00:14:47,039
very uh conserved some of them are

345
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:50,680
broken up is that by Design or by

346
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:53,120
mutation I don't know does the

347
00:14:50,679 --> 00:14:55,399
automatically generate patterns that you

348
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:59,120
see on the left because you know the

349
00:14:55,399 --> 00:15:02,440
frame was wider orar you wouldn't good

350
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:04,959
good point so um this the repeat map

351
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:07,440
finds these repeats instantly and

352
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:10,599
regardless of your frame width you have

353
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:12,079
to find you have to bring this red line

354
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:13,879
in you see the red line might have been

355
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:16,120
here I brought it over to the over the

356
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:19,480
white first white line and that tells me

357
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:23,000
number one it tells me that um this is a

358
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:25,519
66 base pair repeat the 66 base pairs

359
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,559
from here to here and then I can set the

360
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:29,720
width and then everything lines up and I

361
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:32,559
can see what's going on

362
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:34,839
so uh we do have a function which I I

363
00:15:32,559 --> 00:15:37,479
didn't while we were live I didn't hit

364
00:15:34,839 --> 00:15:39,199
the alignment cylinder display but

365
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:41,319
basically it takes the tanm repeat and

366
00:15:39,198 --> 00:15:43,278
turns it into a coil and then adjusts

367
00:15:41,318 --> 00:15:45,519
the coil width till all the tanm repeats

368
00:15:43,278 --> 00:15:48,759
are visible we actually believe that

369
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:51,519
tanm repeats coil in the nucleus and so

370
00:15:48,759 --> 00:15:53,000
they form like solenoid like structures

371
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:54,360
and that that's what these repeats are

372
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:58,278
all

373
00:15:54,360 --> 00:16:01,278
about so this is a just a striking uh

374
00:15:58,278 --> 00:16:02,879
compon component of if you zoom out so

375
00:16:01,278 --> 00:16:06,318
you're looking at a whole grape

376
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:09,278
chromosome what you see is this 66 base

377
00:16:06,318 --> 00:16:13,000
pair repeat is massively throughout the

378
00:16:09,278 --> 00:16:17,159
center of this chromosome like just

379
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:21,120
um um millions of nucleotides are are

380
00:16:17,159 --> 00:16:24,000
just coding for this repeat

381
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:27,120
so okay this is the same repeat actually

382
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:29,679
showing the the solenoid display and so

383
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:32,679
you can see we believe that this is not

384
00:16:29,679 --> 00:16:34,838
in nature it can't raster that rastering

385
00:16:32,679 --> 00:16:36,958
you know this is a nice 2D display but

386
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:39,480
this is meant to be a 3D display we can

387
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:42,239
make that spin and we can uh we believe

388
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:44,399
this is the actual structure in biology

389
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:47,198
it this keeps coiling because it DNA it

390
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:49,318
turns out wants to align with its own

391
00:16:47,198 --> 00:16:52,719
similar sequence and so the logical

392
00:16:49,318 --> 00:16:52,719
thing for a repeat is to form a

393
00:16:52,839 --> 00:16:59,680
coil so this is uh again Eng grape

394
00:16:57,078 --> 00:17:01,559
showing uh but we don't have it there's

395
00:16:59,679 --> 00:17:03,439
no published exons to my knowledge for

396
00:17:01,559 --> 00:17:07,159
grape but we would predict there's an

397
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:09,919
Exon here almost certainly an Exxon here

398
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:13,000
and and possibly xon here the blue line

399
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:15,000
is a strength indicator and when it goes

400
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,558
to purple that means Bingo you've

401
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,558
definitely got an

402
00:17:18,759 --> 00:17:24,439
Exxon so just more ex evidence of

403
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:27,720
exons

404
00:17:24,439 --> 00:17:29,160
um a little more of the same so I'm just

405
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:30,960
going to keep moving because you know I

406
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:32,798
could show you zillions of pictures I

407
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:34,880
mentioned that there are thousands and

408
00:17:32,798 --> 00:17:37,759
th these are just a few snapshots of the

409
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:40,080
genome but the Tomato genome is a Sim

410
00:17:37,759 --> 00:17:41,798
another horticulturally important crop

411
00:17:40,079 --> 00:17:44,399
where they've completed the genome and

412
00:17:41,798 --> 00:17:48,720
assembled it and what you see here again

413
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:52,038
is um there's some strange uh repeats

414
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:54,079
here which are fuzzy they're IL defined

415
00:17:52,038 --> 00:17:55,640
uh we have the threer pattern which is

416
00:17:54,079 --> 00:17:58,119
very strong indication that there's

417
00:17:55,640 --> 00:18:01,159
protein coating here and then and then

418
00:17:58,119 --> 00:18:04,399
these other ones are possible

419
00:18:01,159 --> 00:18:05,840
exons since exons only represent 1 to 2%

420
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:08,120
of the genome it's critical to be able

421
00:18:05,839 --> 00:18:10,519
to identify where they

422
00:18:08,119 --> 00:18:14,079
are more potential

423
00:18:10,519 --> 00:18:16,918
exons um and showing some of the larger

424
00:18:14,079 --> 00:18:19,079
tandem repeats that would be you know

425
00:18:16,919 --> 00:18:21,000
these really big wavy repeats that I

426
00:18:19,079 --> 00:18:24,639
show you there's a name for that it's

427
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:26,679
called Alpha satellite DNA and uh and so

428
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:28,480
all plants and animals when you see the

429
00:18:26,679 --> 00:18:31,559
wavy pattern you know you're looking at

430
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:33,519
Alpha satellite DNA the all ha organisms

431
00:18:31,558 --> 00:18:35,918
show this wavy

432
00:18:33,519 --> 00:18:39,519
pattern and oh I know I want to go back

433
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:42,600
for a second um you see that there's a

434
00:18:39,519 --> 00:18:45,679
region here that's got more red and

435
00:18:42,599 --> 00:18:47,599
green and versus the other Bluer areas

436
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:49,840
so this is a GCR region so it's a

437
00:18:47,599 --> 00:18:53,158
potentially a gene and again you'll see

438
00:18:49,839 --> 00:18:55,519
it's bracketed by a tanm repeats so the

439
00:18:53,159 --> 00:18:58,320
same pattern we saw in corn is showing

440
00:18:55,519 --> 00:19:00,798
up in tomato and to my knowledge this

441
00:18:58,319 --> 00:19:02,678
pattern has never been seen before and

442
00:19:00,798 --> 00:19:04,599
until I've seen it in the last few

443
00:19:02,679 --> 00:19:07,120
months as I've been looking at plant

444
00:19:04,599 --> 00:19:09,279
genomes more so this is this is the idea

445
00:19:07,119 --> 00:19:10,879
of data visualization is it will show

446
00:19:09,279 --> 00:19:13,038
you patterns that the computer wouldn't

447
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:14,720
have spotted what we see is these things

448
00:19:13,038 --> 00:19:17,038
come in pairs and they tend to bracket

449
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:18,640
protein coating region what are they

450
00:19:17,038 --> 00:19:24,158
doing we don't know but it gives us

451
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:24,159
reason to want to do research on that

452
00:19:24,359 --> 00:19:29,079
um a lot of things are actually

453
00:19:27,119 --> 00:19:32,639
repeated uh

454
00:19:29,079 --> 00:19:36,079
uh so there's a lot of repetition in the

455
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:38,759
genome so that's uh more of these

456
00:19:36,079 --> 00:19:40,000
bracketed areas you see this is a this

457
00:19:38,759 --> 00:19:42,839
is an

458
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,960
important um clue as to what's going on

459
00:19:42,839 --> 00:19:47,759
in the genome

460
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:50,759
and none of these have been annotated so

461
00:19:47,759 --> 00:19:52,679
it's all you know it's really showing us

462
00:19:50,759 --> 00:19:54,919
things about the genome we wouldn't have

463
00:19:52,679 --> 00:19:56,400
known without it then the rice genome

464
00:19:54,919 --> 00:19:59,880
this is really a pretty picture it's a

465
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:03,840
picture of the uh the centromeric Alpha

466
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:07,320
DNA Alpha DNA of rice and I'll just show

467
00:20:03,839 --> 00:20:08,798
it quickly because rice like corn the

468
00:20:07,319 --> 00:20:11,240
monocots are really have really

469
00:20:08,798 --> 00:20:13,079
different genomes they have a you just

470
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:16,038
notice the color is different there's

471
00:20:13,079 --> 00:20:18,079
much more red and green greenish yellow

472
00:20:16,038 --> 00:20:20,200
and much less blue so when you're in the

473
00:20:18,079 --> 00:20:22,199
dcot everything's bluish and

474
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:24,038
everything's orangish when you go here

475
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:26,600
we've zoomed in so you can see a little

476
00:20:24,038 --> 00:20:29,200
more specifically the patterns that are

477
00:20:26,599 --> 00:20:31,719
occurring within the the deviations

478
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:33,440
within the tandem repeat and there's

479
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:35,558
some interesting things that are going

480
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:37,798
on here that would be worthy of

481
00:20:35,558 --> 00:20:40,639
exploration and you can see here in

482
00:20:37,798 --> 00:20:42,480
Greater detail it goes a a dark column a

483
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:44,200
dark column a light column a dark column

484
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:47,880
a dark column a light column so you can

485
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:50,558
see more clearly uh what's what what

486
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:52,159
that threer display is what it's telling

487
00:20:50,558 --> 00:20:54,720
us it's telling us every third

488
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:56,720
nucleotide is similar to the three to

489
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:59,720
the one that was three nucleotides

490
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:04,440
before it and and that so basically the

491
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:06,919
lighter the pixel the more the

492
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:10,320
similarity averaged over the whole

493
00:21:06,919 --> 00:21:12,640
string so another thing that uh is a

494
00:21:10,319 --> 00:21:16,278
major feature of genomes that we're

495
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:18,919
seeing is the every other pattern and

496
00:21:16,278 --> 00:21:22,960
this is basically black and blue

497
00:21:18,919 --> 00:21:26,600
alternating uh sprinkled with uh with

498
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:29,679
greens and reds and so we have no idea

499
00:21:26,599 --> 00:21:32,000
what that is but it's out plant and

500
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:33,798
animal genomes so I don't doubt for a

501
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:37,400
minute that it's doing

502
00:21:33,798 --> 00:21:41,079
something um this is just more evidence

503
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:44,320
of exons in rice this pattern is very

504
00:21:41,079 --> 00:21:45,879
strong and you can also see the GC rich

505
00:21:44,319 --> 00:21:48,200
and you can even see the alignment

506
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:50,559
things are lining up here partially

507
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:53,640
because the because of this pattern it's

508
00:21:50,558 --> 00:21:55,918
very very strong it means it constrains

509
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:57,240
most of the nucleotides in the genome a

510
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:58,840
lot of us you know we've been taught

511
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:00,720
that most nucleotides are just drifting

512
00:21:58,839 --> 00:22:03,199
and they don't matter uh most

513
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:06,278
nucleotides in genome have a function

514
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:09,278
and therefore um need an

515
00:22:06,278 --> 00:22:11,119
explanation more more axons just really

516
00:22:09,278 --> 00:22:13,480
rice is really

517
00:22:11,119 --> 00:22:19,439
really strong

518
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:22,599
signal um okay so that's that's

519
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:24,840
the kind of a quick overview of what

520
00:22:22,599 --> 00:22:28,359
plant genomes look like when they're

521
00:22:24,839 --> 00:22:30,720
visualized with Skittle Skittle is a a

522
00:22:28,359 --> 00:22:32,319
um program that's in development in fact

523
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:35,360
some of these features the feature that

524
00:22:32,319 --> 00:22:37,879
measures the the where the exons are the

525
00:22:35,359 --> 00:22:40,240
strength of that signal uh was just is

526
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:42,679
just two days old Josiah emailed me the

527
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:45,359
latest revision uh so it's all still

528
00:22:42,679 --> 00:22:47,840
being improved but what what we believe

529
00:22:45,359 --> 00:22:49,599
we have here is a universal genome

530
00:22:47,839 --> 00:22:52,000
browser now some of you know what a

531
00:22:49,599 --> 00:22:53,319
genome browser is but basically if you

532
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,240
looking at you know let's say three

533
00:22:53,319 --> 00:22:57,240
billion letters and you're trying to

534
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:58,919
figure out what it all codes for you

535
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:00,640
can't just look at at the letters and so

536
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:02,759
they've made genome browsers that help

537
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:05,759
you spot where the genes are help you

538
00:23:02,759 --> 00:23:09,000
analyze where the junk or the repeat is

539
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:10,960
and other types of um you know

540
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:13,400
understanding of how the genome is

541
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:16,278
operating we feel that Skittle is the

542
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:18,159
foundation for developing all those all

543
00:23:16,278 --> 00:23:19,159
those browsers are one-dimensional

544
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:21,919
they're

545
00:23:19,159 --> 00:23:24,640
strings and so this is a two-dimensional

546
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:26,720
display two-dimensional analysis and be

547
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:28,840
and uh it lets us we believe it's the

548
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:31,440
next generation of genome browser and

549
00:23:28,839 --> 00:23:34,319
that this we when we get Skittle fully

550
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:36,038
developed we can uh annotate and

551
00:23:34,319 --> 00:23:38,558
recognize every feature within the

552
00:23:36,038 --> 00:23:40,720
genome in a way that's fundamentally

553
00:23:38,558 --> 00:23:44,319
better than genome browsers today so

554
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:46,200
we're excited about that um and it's uh

555
00:23:44,319 --> 00:23:48,759
already I think bearing fruit in terms

556
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:51,278
of giving us new insight into plant

557
00:23:48,759 --> 00:23:55,119
genomes and other genomes but uh I

558
00:23:51,278 --> 00:23:58,159
wanted to add just briefly um some work

559
00:23:55,119 --> 00:24:00,639
that my colleague Josiah Seaman did on

560
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:03,000
his own so Josiah Seaman you know a

561
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:06,000
computer scientist I have to I digress

562
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:11,278
for a second

563
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:14,038
um so I was um I was never interested in

564
00:24:11,278 --> 00:24:16,839
computer science not even a little bit

565
00:24:14,038 --> 00:24:18,759
and um and so I looked that as a

566
00:24:16,839 --> 00:24:20,278
necessary evil I mentioned that you know

567
00:24:18,759 --> 00:24:22,158
I was the last one in our department to

568
00:24:20,278 --> 00:24:24,519
switch from the typewriter to to a

569
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:26,760
computer for word processing and then

570
00:24:24,519 --> 00:24:28,798
when email came along I absolutely did

571
00:24:26,759 --> 00:24:30,240
not want to be bothered email I was

572
00:24:28,798 --> 00:24:32,398
absolutely the last person in our

573
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:35,399
department to finally connect to the

574
00:24:32,398 --> 00:24:38,239
email so it's really funny to me that in

575
00:24:35,398 --> 00:24:40,599
the last 10 years I've uh played a role

576
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:43,278
in developing what I think are the two

577
00:24:40,599 --> 00:24:45,480
most exciting bioinformatics programs

578
00:24:43,278 --> 00:24:47,880
available and of course the reason is I

579
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:49,240
had the good sense to partner up with

580
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:51,480
some really brilliant computer

581
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:54,679
scientists because I'm still practically

582
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:58,319
computer illiterate but um but Josiah

583
00:24:54,679 --> 00:25:00,960
Josiah is one of those people and um

584
00:24:58,319 --> 00:25:03,240
he developed all the programming that

585
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:06,000
went into this and

586
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:08,440
uh it turns out that you can look at any

587
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:11,519
patterns with Skittle like you can look

588
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:14,240
open up any text file you can open up

589
00:25:11,519 --> 00:25:17,119
Moby Dick and see what the pattern is

590
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:18,919
you can also open up computer code so

591
00:25:17,119 --> 00:25:21,798
the way he found out he could open up

592
00:25:18,919 --> 00:25:23,960
computer code was when you start Skittle

593
00:25:21,798 --> 00:25:25,398
it asks you what file you want to open

594
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:28,440
and he forgot that he had already opened

595
00:25:25,398 --> 00:25:30,839
Skittles so he used Skittle open the

596
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:33,679
skittle executable code does that make

597
00:25:30,839 --> 00:25:35,918
sense and he immediately saw some really

598
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:39,360
surprising patterns so it turns out that

599
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:41,440
Skittle can be used for analyzing um

600
00:25:39,359 --> 00:25:43,319
execu code and that's machine language

601
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:45,558
so it's something no computer no

602
00:25:43,319 --> 00:25:48,278
computer scientist almost no computer

603
00:25:45,558 --> 00:25:49,678
scientist can read machine language so

604
00:25:48,278 --> 00:25:52,720
this is the first time we actually get

605
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:54,640
to look at computer code uh I don't have

606
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:56,360
the uh that would make a really

607
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:57,720
interesting talk but I just want to give

608
00:25:56,359 --> 00:26:01,038
you some highlights from what he said

609
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:04,399
saw um this is Moby

610
00:26:01,038 --> 00:26:06,839
Dick so there's no no pattern no

611
00:26:04,398 --> 00:26:09,719
nucleotide bi this is the repeat map

612
00:26:06,839 --> 00:26:10,918
there's no significant amount of repeats

613
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:13,399
that'd be pretty boring wouldn't it to

614
00:26:10,919 --> 00:26:17,159
have two the same chapter twice in a row

615
00:26:13,398 --> 00:26:20,839
um so the genome for decades has been

616
00:26:17,159 --> 00:26:24,360
called The Book of Life but we assert

617
00:26:20,839 --> 00:26:27,398
strongly that the actual genome has no

618
00:26:24,359 --> 00:26:29,719
uh physical similarity to a book and a

619
00:26:27,398 --> 00:26:33,398
book is passive but a computer program

620
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:34,440
is active and runs it's alive so here's

621
00:26:33,398 --> 00:26:39,158
what

622
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:41,840
uh we this is a zoomed out version of a

623
00:26:39,159 --> 00:26:44,720
one one of these is executable code

624
00:26:41,839 --> 00:26:48,720
zoomed out so you look at the whole code

625
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:51,399
uh maybe 60,000 bytes of code and the

626
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:52,640
other one is a zoomed out so you can see

627
00:26:51,398 --> 00:26:54,879
most of a

628
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:59,159
chromosome which one is code and which

629
00:26:54,880 --> 00:27:01,799
one is ex uh which one is you know they

630
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:03,320
both have these uh these these major

631
00:27:01,798 --> 00:27:07,000
shifts in color

632
00:27:03,319 --> 00:27:09,480
change uh so in DNA we would call the in

633
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:12,079
chromosomes we'd say these are isocor

634
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:14,319
where you have a change in the use of

635
00:27:12,079 --> 00:27:16,879
where the the use of the nucleotides

636
00:27:14,319 --> 00:27:18,839
changes in a fundamental way well it

637
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:20,799
turns out that computer code does the

638
00:27:18,839 --> 00:27:23,480
same thing but we actually know what

639
00:27:20,798 --> 00:27:25,000
causes these shifts in in color see we

640
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:27,720
know how computer code works but we

641
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:29,480
don't know how genomes work and the fact

642
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:31,759
that we're seeing similarities means we

643
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:33,240
could use one to understand the other

644
00:27:31,759 --> 00:27:35,440
when you have a change here they're

645
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:37,759
going like from Pearl to

646
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:39,679
Fortran it's computer it's when you

647
00:27:37,759 --> 00:27:41,200
change languages you change your letter

648
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:43,798
use profile

649
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:47,038
right these These are clearly language

650
00:27:43,798 --> 00:27:49,759
changes and these are in gen genome are

651
00:27:47,038 --> 00:27:51,359
most likely changes to one of the many

652
00:27:49,759 --> 00:27:55,558
you know there are many languages in DNA

653
00:27:51,359 --> 00:27:55,558
yes sir in the genome

654
00:27:56,519 --> 00:27:59,798
thec

655
00:27:58,079 --> 00:28:04,199
computer code what's the the computer

656
00:27:59,798 --> 00:28:07,200
code is uh z0 is a01 we need two bits to

657
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:09,919
get the four color scheme the book uh

658
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:12,319
the book was I think actually we had 26

659
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:15,038
colors

660
00:28:12,319 --> 00:28:16,480
yeah but they were Shades that your eye

661
00:28:15,038 --> 00:28:20,640
couldn't

662
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:23,960
distinguish so uh so in terms of these

663
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:25,840
changes in letter use uh computer code

664
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:27,679
and and he looked at other executable

665
00:28:25,839 --> 00:28:29,199
code other than his own program we both

666
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:34,120
up lots of and it's it's pretty

667
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:36,319
Universal pattern um then he looked at

668
00:28:34,119 --> 00:28:39,278
um again we're zooming out so we're

669
00:28:36,319 --> 00:28:41,480
looking at a whole chromosome this is um

670
00:28:39,278 --> 00:28:44,159
what's called the repeat map but on a

671
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:47,558
higher scale so here we have for example

672
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:50,640
a long stretch of red which means that a

673
00:28:47,558 --> 00:28:53,319
short repeat um less than 20 base pairs

674
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:55,278
long is repeating and it's repeating for

675
00:28:53,319 --> 00:28:58,639
thousands and maybe tens of thousands of

676
00:28:55,278 --> 00:29:00,640
letters here just this huge repeat and

677
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:02,559
so you can map where all these repeats

678
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:05,720
are in a chromosome and you see they

679
00:29:02,558 --> 00:29:08,038
tend to be all at near the beginning

680
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:10,600
well it turns out that the uh computer

681
00:29:08,038 --> 00:29:13,038
code is also filled with

682
00:29:10,599 --> 00:29:16,278
repeats and for example here would be

683
00:29:13,038 --> 00:29:20,879
another stretch of red that also is a 10

684
00:29:16,278 --> 00:29:23,640
to 20 uh character repeat and and you'll

685
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:25,559
see that which which one is if I asked

686
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:26,759
you if I hadn't already given it away

687
00:29:25,558 --> 00:29:29,240
you wouldn't know which one was a

688
00:29:26,759 --> 00:29:31,919
computer code and which one was the

689
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:34,278
genome would you and so if we look

690
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:38,600
closer at these repeats which of these

691
00:29:34,278 --> 00:29:40,519
repeats is plant repeat and which one is

692
00:29:38,599 --> 00:29:45,839
from computer

693
00:29:40,519 --> 00:29:48,880
code this is plant this a computer so

694
00:29:45,839 --> 00:29:51,359
um the the the tandem repeats in

695
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:54,278
computer code are incredibly similar to

696
00:29:51,359 --> 00:29:55,918
what we see in Plants amazingly similar

697
00:29:54,278 --> 00:29:57,919
so here's the interesting thing is for

698
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:59,720
decades people have seen

699
00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:02,480
we have known that there are these tanm

700
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:05,679
repeats and they said obviously repeats

701
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:07,720
are junk well are the repeats in

702
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:11,679
computer code junk are there is there a

703
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:14,120
single bit in a computer code that's not

704
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:16,880
functional so it's strongly suggest

705
00:30:14,119 --> 00:30:19,278
these tanm re beats aren't here that

706
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:21,720
this isn't a coincidence it reflects

707
00:30:19,278 --> 00:30:23,798
functionality and that the the we

708
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:25,880
actually know what these repeats are for

709
00:30:23,798 --> 00:30:28,440
these are data

710
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:30,919
files like phone directory would be a

711
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:33,000
data file the first this would be like

712
00:30:30,919 --> 00:30:34,840
some Universal thing like telephone

713
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:39,278
number and then people have different

714
00:30:34,839 --> 00:30:41,480
numbers so data files uh in computer

715
00:30:39,278 --> 00:30:43,759
code give you this perhaps these are

716
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:47,798
data

717
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:51,879
files so these another element of plant

718
00:30:47,798 --> 00:30:53,278
genome is that U they're called what are

719
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:55,720
dispersed repeats you know you can have

720
00:30:53,278 --> 00:30:57,720
repeats where they're head to toe or you

721
00:30:55,720 --> 00:31:01,600
can have the same repeating element all

722
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:05,399
throughout the genome and so these these

723
00:31:01,599 --> 00:31:07,638
would be called um these would be plant

724
00:31:05,398 --> 00:31:10,239
this would be like a transposable

725
00:31:07,638 --> 00:31:12,439
element and these would be words that

726
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:15,120
are common within the computer language

727
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:17,399
so you can actually you know write in

728
00:31:15,119 --> 00:31:21,278
any sequence you want and it'll look

729
00:31:17,398 --> 00:31:22,798
through through the uh script and find

730
00:31:21,278 --> 00:31:25,119
wherever it occurs so you can find out

731
00:31:22,798 --> 00:31:27,000
how abundant certain words are so word

732
00:31:25,119 --> 00:31:31,719
structure use or transposable elements

733
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:35,638
are very similar within code and within

734
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:38,480
genomes so the bottom line is uh what

735
00:31:35,638 --> 00:31:41,199
he's seen is that genomes and executable

736
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:43,558
code have amazing similarities they both

737
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:45,080
use linear strings of code they both use

738
00:31:43,558 --> 00:31:47,038
multiple languages they both use

739
00:31:45,079 --> 00:31:49,558
parallel processing which means you know

740
00:31:47,038 --> 00:31:51,879
you can have lots of genes being reading

741
00:31:49,558 --> 00:31:54,119
at the same time like each like lots of

742
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:56,600
processors in your computer uh they both

743
00:31:54,119 --> 00:31:59,278
have uh strong character bias where the

744
00:31:56,599 --> 00:32:01,240
the total color shift occurs they both

745
00:31:59,278 --> 00:32:03,798
use extensive use of recurrent tandem

746
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:06,200
repeats they both use commonly dispersed

747
00:32:03,798 --> 00:32:08,398
repeats or words they both use large

748
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:10,519
scale localization of the repeats at

749
00:32:08,398 --> 00:32:12,359
near the end ends of the program and

750
00:32:10,519 --> 00:32:14,399
they both have passive and active

751
00:32:12,359 --> 00:32:17,638
information a book just sits there you

752
00:32:14,398 --> 00:32:21,398
can read it or not a program runs and

753
00:32:17,638 --> 00:32:23,638
it's self-changing self-modifying so uh

754
00:32:21,398 --> 00:32:26,119
all of this is consistent with a trend

755
00:32:23,638 --> 00:32:29,638
within genetics more and more

756
00:32:26,119 --> 00:32:33,599
genomicists are saying the genome is

757
00:32:29,638 --> 00:32:35,278
executable code and that's really a

758
00:32:33,599 --> 00:32:37,798
better understanding than the idea that

759
00:32:35,278 --> 00:32:42,038
it's an instruction manual and so it's

760
00:32:37,798 --> 00:32:45,558
just really um exciting to see uh that

761
00:32:42,038 --> 00:32:48,599
Skittle strongly supports that and it

762
00:32:45,558 --> 00:32:51,440
goes from a simile or an analogy to

763
00:32:48,599 --> 00:32:53,439
actually a um something we can measure

764
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:56,159
where we can actually measure the the

765
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:57,679
features that are in common so I just

766
00:32:56,159 --> 00:33:00,120
like to conclude

767
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:02,399
uh I believe there are deep hidden

768
00:33:00,119 --> 00:33:04,319
there's deep hidden Beauty in the genome

769
00:33:02,398 --> 00:33:09,398
and so I've gazed at these colorful

770
00:33:04,319 --> 00:33:11,200
pictures for um hundreds of hours and uh

771
00:33:09,398 --> 00:33:13,278
it's really cool The genome has many

772
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:15,798
levels of structure we've only detected

773
00:33:13,278 --> 00:33:18,278
a small fraction of it the nucleotide

774
00:33:15,798 --> 00:33:19,359
bias is very strong uh which is

775
00:33:18,278 --> 00:33:22,679
interesting

776
00:33:19,359 --> 00:33:25,678
because uh blue blue black areas want to

777
00:33:22,679 --> 00:33:27,519
mutate to red green and red green areas

778
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:29,919
want to mutate to blue black so it's

779
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:34,240
very hard to imagine how to create or

780
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:37,159
sustain those biases um tan repeats it's

781
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:39,038
clear because they bracket the genes can

782
00:33:37,159 --> 00:33:42,360
carry information they are not

783
00:33:39,038 --> 00:33:44,720
necessarily junk tan repeats can we can

784
00:33:42,359 --> 00:33:47,439
we show can lo would logically form into

785
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:49,919
large coils which might have function we

786
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:53,038
see ubiquitous tumer and threer patterns

787
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:55,360
which threer seems to reflect codon bias

788
00:33:53,038 --> 00:33:57,798
protein cating bias and then there are

789
00:33:55,359 --> 00:34:02,079
many levels of order still waiting to be

790
00:33:57,798 --> 00:34:04,918
found and higher genomes are most like

791
00:34:02,079 --> 00:34:06,519
computer code that's that's uh the

792
00:34:04,919 --> 00:34:09,398
bottom line of what we've been learning

793
00:34:06,519 --> 00:34:12,159
the last few years using Skittle that's

794
00:34:09,398 --> 00:34:12,159
a good place to

795
00:34:18,838 --> 00:34:24,559
stop well the one connection I

796
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:27,000
would suggest is that uh there's

797
00:34:24,559 --> 00:34:29,199
communication at every level you know

798
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:31,519
know from the molecules to the cells to

799
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:33,559
the tissues to communication between

800
00:34:31,519 --> 00:34:36,280
organisms and then of course there's the

801
00:34:33,559 --> 00:34:38,320
brain function which is all kinds of

802
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:41,480
levels of communication there so

803
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:44,039
information is at the at the heart of

804
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:47,559
21st century biology it's all really

805
00:34:44,039 --> 00:34:50,719
about information science and

806
00:34:47,559 --> 00:34:54,559
um and everything is integrated at a

807
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:56,480
level that blows our mind and so uh it's

808
00:34:54,559 --> 00:35:00,559
very hard to conceive of how that

809
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:02,199
integration ation could have ever Arisen

810
00:35:00,559 --> 00:35:03,480
and so it's just a really interesting

811
00:35:02,199 --> 00:35:05,519
question that I think more and more

812
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:08,679
people are going to be asking is biology

813
00:35:05,519 --> 00:35:13,039
is much more fantastic than we ever

814
00:35:08,679 --> 00:35:15,358
imagined and uh so it's just a real it

815
00:35:13,039 --> 00:35:19,480
makes it exciting to be a biologist in

816
00:35:15,358 --> 00:35:21,078
the 21st century right so um basically

817
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:23,320
for data visualization you have to be

818
00:35:21,079 --> 00:35:25,160
creative in in presenting the data in

819
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:27,960
new ways to the human brain the human

820
00:35:25,159 --> 00:35:30,440
brain works by methods we have no idea

821
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:32,320
but um when we do see a pattern like I'm

822
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:34,000
seeing this pattern where I have a what

823
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:36,359
looks like a large coding region that

824
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:38,760
has not previously been identified as a

825
00:35:36,358 --> 00:35:40,239
Exxon and I see it's bracketed by tandem

826
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:43,240
repeats and I realize that's a highly

827
00:35:40,239 --> 00:35:46,479
ordered structure and uh what Josiah

828
00:35:43,239 --> 00:35:48,239
points out is he says uh Skittle is for

829
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:50,199
discovering the pattern but then you

830
00:35:48,239 --> 00:35:52,159
have to write special computer code to

831
00:35:50,199 --> 00:35:53,919
analyze the pattern so now we can go

832
00:35:52,159 --> 00:35:55,759
back and ask the computer to find every

833
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:57,240
instance on that chromosome where that

834
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:59,839
pattern happens that's that's the next

835
00:35:57,239 --> 00:35:59,838
step for that

836
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:04,318
research

837
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:08,039
yeah what's the plan for Skittle and

838
00:36:04,318 --> 00:36:09,759
it's under development it becomes fin

839
00:36:08,039 --> 00:36:11,679
it's it's available free of charge you

840
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:13,599
can download it anytime it's really easy

841
00:36:11,679 --> 00:36:15,159
to you know it's a really easy to

842
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:16,920
understand how to use it but it will

843
00:36:15,159 --> 00:36:20,000
continue it's being updated almost

844
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:22,280
weekly so and actually Josiah's just

845
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:24,159
introduced a feature so if you're online

846
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:25,960
and you're using Skittle and he updates

847
00:36:24,159 --> 00:36:27,879
it there a little thing will come up on

848
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:29,960
Skittle that says update now and you'll

849
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:31,519
get the latest version so he realizes

850
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:34,599
that it's going to be under rapid and

851
00:36:31,519 --> 00:36:36,318
continuous Improvement so so they don't

852
00:36:34,599 --> 00:36:38,640
have there's nothing like Skittle no one

853
00:36:36,318 --> 00:36:40,759
has a program like Skittle um I wish

854
00:36:38,639 --> 00:36:43,799
they would take notice of Skittle but

855
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:45,079
they haven't uh I think as we uh

856
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:46,440
actually this corn pattern that I

857
00:36:45,079 --> 00:36:48,440
described when we show that we use

858
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:50,400
Skittle to discover that which I which

859
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:53,000
is I think a major feature of the Corn

860
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:54,720
genome uh then people will say oh I

861
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,679
guess maybe I should look into this

862
00:36:54,719 --> 00:36:58,078
Skittle

863
00:36:55,679 --> 00:37:00,199
business because it is a powerful tool

864
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:02,359
to just see what's going on and also for

865
00:37:00,199 --> 00:37:04,118
teaching if you were teaching genome to

866
00:37:02,358 --> 00:37:06,960
students and you just show them A's T's

867
00:37:04,119 --> 00:37:08,800
C's and G's you you they it doesn't snc

868
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:10,639
in but with Skittle actually you can

869
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:12,000
start to see oh I see what's going on

870
00:37:10,639 --> 00:37:13,679
here there's I start to see the

871
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:16,039
different types of organization within

872
00:37:13,679 --> 00:37:18,879
the genome so I think uh it's both a

873
00:37:16,039 --> 00:37:22,960
research tool and a a great teaching

874
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:27,519
tool the Bott yes we we basically upload

875
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:29,159
uh any fasta file and uh it it basically

876
00:37:27,519 --> 00:37:31,000
the first thing it does is just colorize

877
00:37:29,159 --> 00:37:32,480
the letters that's really simple but as

878
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:35,159
soon as that happens you start to see

879
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:37,519
patterns then it allows us to change the

880
00:37:35,159 --> 00:37:39,519
width or zoom in and out and it allows

881
00:37:37,519 --> 00:37:41,960
us to put up the repeat map or the

882
00:37:39,519 --> 00:37:45,599
cylinder display or several other

883
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:48,159
display options so but the raw data is

884
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:49,800
that colorful screen and you're actually

885
00:37:48,159 --> 00:37:51,759
looking at the genome when you look at

886
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:53,640
that just like you are see looking at a

887
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:55,599
fast file but it's a lot more

888
00:37:53,639 --> 00:37:59,838
interesting than a fast

889
00:37:55,599 --> 00:38:04,200
file so your repeat

890
00:37:59,838 --> 00:38:06,078
file the data so so the repeat map takes

891
00:38:04,199 --> 00:38:08,318
the first line whatever whatever the

892
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:11,079
width is it reads the first line and

893
00:38:08,318 --> 00:38:12,960
then Compares that to the this to the

894
00:38:11,079 --> 00:38:14,920
one nucleotide over the line that

895
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:16,720
represents the next nucleotide over and

896
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:18,920
then it Compares that first line with

897
00:38:16,719 --> 00:38:22,959
every other possible alignment on in the

898
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:25,318
view and then for every alignment it it

899
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:27,000
gives a score for the similarity and

900
00:38:25,318 --> 00:38:31,039
decides how bright the pixel should be

901
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:34,280
for that spot so it's uh it performs a

902
00:38:31,039 --> 00:38:37,199
massive uh calculation each time you

903
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:39,720
move the screen to recognize all the

904
00:38:37,199 --> 00:38:42,118
possible similarities between the first

905
00:38:39,719 --> 00:38:44,399
string and all the other parts of that

906
00:38:42,119 --> 00:38:46,559
display the WID thing seems to me that

907
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:51,880
the WID

908
00:38:46,559 --> 00:38:55,960
detn is you optimize the WID to come up

909
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:59,039
with so the dis the display pattern the

910
00:38:55,960 --> 00:39:01,519
the the map which is black and the gray

911
00:38:59,039 --> 00:39:04,119
the gray scale uh that actually doesn't

912
00:39:01,519 --> 00:39:06,838
change as you change width it is it is

913
00:39:04,119 --> 00:39:09,358
just measuring the repeats so you'll see

914
00:39:06,838 --> 00:39:13,039
those repeats uh regardless of the

915
00:39:09,358 --> 00:39:15,799
display and then the cylinder display uh

916
00:39:13,039 --> 00:39:18,639
finds the best alignment but the regular

917
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:21,039
display you have to manually uh adjust

918
00:39:18,639 --> 00:39:24,480
the width to get those nice uh visual

919
00:39:21,039 --> 00:39:28,279
patterns of the U tandem repeats so

920
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:33,480
there's possibly even a pattern

921
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:33,480
wi like you at different you may find

922
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:40,079
commonality so there's a the 66 myrr

923
00:39:37,079 --> 00:39:43,560
that I found in tomato was also in

924
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:46,039
corn yeah there's there's uh and and

925
00:39:43,559 --> 00:39:47,880
when you find a repeat you'll find that

926
00:39:46,039 --> 00:39:49,838
it's a family of repeats throughout that

927
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:53,240
chromosome and all the chromosomes of

928
00:39:49,838 --> 00:39:55,199
that species very few repeats are novel

929
00:39:53,239 --> 00:39:56,919
they're they're they're like words

930
00:39:55,199 --> 00:39:58,199
they're doing something and

931
00:39:56,920 --> 00:40:00,639
and they and they're found in many

932
00:39:58,199 --> 00:40:04,318
different places in the

933
00:40:00,639 --> 00:40:06,598
genome so basically um as as we discover

934
00:40:04,318 --> 00:40:08,358
these new layers of information we would

935
00:40:06,599 --> 00:40:10,599
like to have it like you know how

936
00:40:08,358 --> 00:40:12,400
oldfashioned overhead transparencies you

937
00:40:10,599 --> 00:40:14,480
could put several on top and they you

938
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:16,559
could see how they all line up we'd like

939
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:17,880
to have Skittle have transparent Pages

940
00:40:16,559 --> 00:40:19,799
some you you could adjust the

941
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:21,400
transparency so we can see where the

942
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:23,200
exons are we can see where the

943
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:24,480
transcriptional factor binding sites are

944
00:40:23,199 --> 00:40:26,679
we can see where the histone binding

945
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:30,440
sites are we can see where the fold

946
00:40:26,679 --> 00:40:32,399
folding uh motifs are because there's

947
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:34,119
layer upon layer of information and the

948
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:36,240
only way is to have layered a layered

949
00:40:34,119 --> 00:40:39,800
display so that's the

950
00:40:36,239 --> 00:40:39,799
next uh that's in the

951
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:44,680
works thank you very much

952
00:40:52,239 --> 00:40:57,959
thanks this has been a production of
