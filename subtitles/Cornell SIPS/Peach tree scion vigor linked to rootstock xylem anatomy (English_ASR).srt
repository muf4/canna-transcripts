1
00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:04,399
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:10,119 --> 00:00:14,160
University thanks Neil it's a real

3
00:00:12,718 --> 00:00:17,320
pleasure to be here and I like to thank

4
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,839
Neil for being such a great host uh and

5
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:23,118
it's good to see him again and it's good

6
00:00:18,839 --> 00:00:25,800
to see him thriving here um and it's a

7
00:00:23,118 --> 00:00:31,960
pleasure to be here I've

8
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:31,960
uh it's it doesn't seem like spring here

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,039
it's 82Â° today in

10
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:42,159
Sacramento that's a little too warm for

11
00:00:38,039 --> 00:00:45,679
us but uh it's a pleasure to be here

12
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:49,078
nonetheless and it's and it's also this

13
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:50,799
symos of thing uh lee Lang and and

14
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:55,439
Terren put it

15
00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:57,558
together uh it's it's uh nicknamed the

16
00:00:55,439 --> 00:01:00,000
old fart Symposium because it's supposed

17
00:00:57,558 --> 00:01:04,438
to be bunch a bunch of us tree crop

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,959
physiologists who who are in the process

19
00:01:04,438 --> 00:01:09,879
retiring in the in the somewhat either

20
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:11,798
already retired or in the in the

21
00:01:09,879 --> 00:01:15,079
relatively near future

22
00:01:11,799 --> 00:01:18,600
retiring and uh I did get my degree in

23
00:01:15,079 --> 00:01:21,599
in in at Davis but it was in the botney

24
00:01:18,599 --> 00:01:27,000
department and my PhD was in beach and

25
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:29,078
dune plant ecology so I I I never did

26
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,200
have a formal course in pomology or

27
00:01:29,078 --> 00:01:36,039
horiculture in life but now I'm the

28
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:39,960
primary uh pomology instructor at Davis

29
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:43,240
so life is full of

30
00:01:39,959 --> 00:01:47,158
fun uh and I've really enjoyed my career

31
00:01:43,239 --> 00:01:48,478
uh in in tree fruit physiology I look at

32
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:51,079
I look at

33
00:01:48,478 --> 00:01:52,239
pomology as basically applied

34
00:01:51,078 --> 00:01:56,279
environmental

35
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:58,438
physiology uh with trees and I'm uh

36
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:00,519
today I'm going to talk about work that

37
00:01:58,438 --> 00:02:02,879
we've done

38
00:02:00,519 --> 00:02:05,640
uh with uh

39
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:08,079
rootstock physiology work

40
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:10,239
primarily uh I spent a lot of my time

41
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,599
doing crop modeling tree crop modeling

42
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:15,080
and a whole bunch of other sort of

43
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:17,598
things I'll talk about that uh on on

44
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:18,959
Wednesday U of this week at the Geneva

45
00:02:17,598 --> 00:02:21,399
meeting so I thought I'd do something a

46
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:22,959
little different here

47
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:28,760
today

48
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:31,080
um and about 30 years ago now um Scott

49
00:02:28,759 --> 00:02:33,799
Johnson and myself

50
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:36,680
uh teamed up with a USDA scientist who

51
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:38,159
had been collecting potentially dwarfing

52
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:41,000
root stocks for

53
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:43,079
peach Scott Johnson actually was a

54
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,239
graduate from Cornell he's one of uh

55
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:48,640
alen lao's early PhD students and he's

56
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:50,439
the extension specialist at Kerney at

57
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:52,679
the Kerney egg Center which is in the in

58
00:02:50,439 --> 00:02:56,158
the Central Valley of California he and

59
00:02:52,680 --> 00:03:00,080
I have done a lot of work together and

60
00:02:56,158 --> 00:03:04,719
uh we we uh started looking at at these

61
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:06,360
root stocks and and and our our typical

62
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:09,439
for these are all going to talk about

63
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:11,879
Peach exclusively today uh our standard

64
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:14,479
Peach root stock in California is nagard

65
00:03:11,878 --> 00:03:17,439
it's a very vigorous root stock selected

66
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:20,399
for uh root not nematode resistance and

67
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:22,878
and vigor our Growers are interested in

68
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:25,158
having a much are having some size

69
00:03:22,878 --> 00:03:28,079
reduction and less pruning costs and so

70
00:03:25,158 --> 00:03:31,120
on so we we began looking at some of

71
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:33,519
these selections uh

72
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:36,640
from that program we started out with

73
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:39,599
122 different accessions of

74
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:43,399
genotypes and we narrowed and we we got

75
00:03:39,598 --> 00:03:46,000
about 82 of those to root from hardwood

76
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:48,560
cuting and from that we narrowed it down

77
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,639
to to 10 that looked reasonably good and

78
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,280
then we finally ended up with these two

79
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:54,759
controller N9 and what are called

80
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:57,598
controller 9 and controller 5 here and

81
00:03:54,759 --> 00:03:58,679
this Hawa is an old root stock from

82
00:03:57,598 --> 00:04:02,119
South

83
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:05,640
Dakota but they all had some dwarfing so

84
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:07,640
this is the the uh trunk

85
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:11,039
circumferences and you can see there

86
00:04:07,639 --> 00:04:14,000
some dwarfing after 12 years um and this

87
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:16,918
is the standard open vase tree these are

88
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,439
perpendicular V or V shaped tree they

89
00:04:16,918 --> 00:04:21,159
also and consistently with two different

90
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:23,680
tops two different

91
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:26,639
signs so the the trees aren't

92
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:28,120
tremendously smaller but this is nagard

93
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:31,800
uh or

94
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:34,360
uh uh loell Peach on nagard and this is

95
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:36,800
the one on controller 9 this is

96
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:38,560
controller 5 the size of the trees isn't

97
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:41,240
that much smaller but the openness of

98
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:43,439
the trees is much greater and we have

99
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:46,280
much less response to pruning when we

100
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:48,399
prune these two as opposed to this as

101
00:04:46,279 --> 00:04:51,319
you can see here this is some of the

102
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:53,918
from the early again two different uh

103
00:04:51,319 --> 00:04:55,639
two different tops and two different

104
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:58,159
Training

105
00:04:55,639 --> 00:05:01,038
Systems uh and

106
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:03,199
consistently this is the the dry mass of

107
00:05:01,038 --> 00:05:05,120
the of the dormant prunings well

108
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:07,120
actually some are in dorant prunings put

109
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:10,478
together and you can see the difference

110
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:13,800
in pruning weight is quite sign

111
00:05:10,478 --> 00:05:18,079
significant uh subsequent to that early

112
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:22,000
study uh Fred Bliss came to Davis and

113
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:25,879
started looking at additional crosses

114
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:29,879
and the herob blood by okan okan cross

115
00:05:25,879 --> 00:05:34,240
was uh was really really through a lot

116
00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:37,759
of variation in in uh size controlling

117
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:40,840
potential and so we've released uh four

118
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:43,639
more root stocks in addition to the ini

119
00:05:40,839 --> 00:05:46,079
initial two the initial two are

120
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:47,280
controller nine and controller five

121
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:50,519
controller

122
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:53,519
five trees actually almost too

123
00:05:50,519 --> 00:05:55,599
small and it produces small fruit so we

124
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:57,879
don't want we don't want dwarf fruit

125
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:00,039
when we have a dwarf tree but these

126
00:05:57,879 --> 00:06:02,439
others are all producing

127
00:06:00,038 --> 00:06:04,959
uh reason I mean yeah reasonably Siz

128
00:06:02,439 --> 00:06:07,918
fruit compared to trees on

129
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:11,519
nagard and so

130
00:06:07,918 --> 00:06:13,639
uh we so we yeah released all of these

131
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:16,399
six and these numbers basically

132
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:20,319
represent something relative to the size

133
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:24,478
of nagard so this should be about 95% so

134
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:28,879
just slightly reducing 90 95% 80% 70%

135
00:06:24,478 --> 00:06:30,598
60% more or less and 50% of trees on

136
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:33,079
nagard

137
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:35,279
so while we did all that sort of

138
00:06:33,079 --> 00:06:36,918
evaluation sorts of work as a

139
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:40,478
physiologist I got more and more

140
00:06:36,918 --> 00:06:42,359
interested in and the dwarfing

141
00:06:40,478 --> 00:06:45,639
mechanism and so I'm going to talk

142
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:48,598
mainly about that and so way back in

143
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:50,639
1939 looking at moling 9 and some of the

144
00:06:48,598 --> 00:06:53,079
mauling root stocks beak pain and and

145
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:54,720
Thompson beak Bain they were both at at

146
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:58,878
East

147
00:06:54,720 --> 00:07:04,000
Ming uh they an analyze the anatomy uh

148
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:07,840
of the SYM and and Flo and so on in in

149
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,598
uh dwarfing apple root stocks and they

150
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:13,318
they showed that the cross-sectional

151
00:07:09,598 --> 00:07:15,360
area the xylm cross-sectional area of

152
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:17,360
the various Apper root stocks composed

153
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,080
of fibers prum and vessel rays and the

154
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,520
percent of fibers and vessels were

155
00:07:19,079 --> 00:07:23,279
proportional to the Vigor of the root

156
00:07:20,519 --> 00:07:26,359
stocks imparted to the

157
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:28,318
San and the more uh dwarfing root stocks

158
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:30,080
had smaller vessels than vigorous root

159
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:31,840
stocks

160
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:34,399
uh and

161
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:36,359
but well then they concluded that at

162
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:39,198
least a partial explanation of the

163
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:41,360
mechanism of root St effect may be

164
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:42,919
obtained from a study of internal

165
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:47,720
structure of the fruit trees they were

166
00:07:42,918 --> 00:07:49,198
very cautious about assigning any causal

167
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:50,800
relationship

168
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:53,919
between

169
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:57,400
uh xylm vessel characteristics the root

170
00:07:53,918 --> 00:08:00,000
stock versus a s to the dwarfing and the

171
00:07:57,399 --> 00:08:01,439
reason for that is some summarized in

172
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,720
this

173
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:06,918
review which is in an annual review of

174
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:11,120
plant physiology by by Rogers and Beak

175
00:08:06,918 --> 00:08:12,918
Bane and and so at that in that review

176
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:15,800
they said that there were basically

177
00:08:12,918 --> 00:08:19,000
three potential mechanisms to explain s

178
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:21,680
root stock interactions one was

179
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,360
nutrient uh May differ greatly in the

180
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,400
capacity for absorbing storing and

181
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:27,080
utilizing

182
00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:29,399
nutrients one was in transport focused

183
00:08:27,079 --> 00:08:31,639
on the flo transport but acknowledged

184
00:08:29,399 --> 00:08:35,399
differences in sizing and sizes and

185
00:08:31,639 --> 00:08:37,080
numbers of vessels are sufficient to Su

186
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:38,879
suggest that the capacity of this island

187
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:41,639
for water transport would be higher and

188
00:08:38,879 --> 00:08:43,838
vigorous than in dwarf plants but this

189
00:08:41,639 --> 00:08:45,639
may not be a limiting factor based on

190
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:48,880
The View that the number of vessels in

191
00:08:45,639 --> 00:08:52,399
the stems is normally greatly in excess

192
00:08:48,879 --> 00:08:54,559
of that required to transport water so

193
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:57,559
as you know we have lots and lots of

194
00:08:54,559 --> 00:08:59,239
xylm area in trees and so they basically

195
00:08:57,559 --> 00:09:00,759
said well it doesn't make sense that

196
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:03,159
that this can actually be a limiting

197
00:09:00,759 --> 00:09:05,958
factor because in general we think that

198
00:09:03,159 --> 00:09:09,399
there's excess xylm

199
00:09:05,958 --> 00:09:12,119
capacity and then the one related to to

200
00:09:09,399 --> 00:09:15,320
to uh growth regulating substance

201
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:18,159
substances which basically has been sort

202
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:20,680
of the principle uh mechanism that's

203
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:21,439
been B bandied around for the rest for

204
00:09:20,679 --> 00:09:24,479
the

205
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:27,079
last 60

206
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:29,680
years so

207
00:09:27,078 --> 00:09:32,319
uh I had a graduate student

208
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:35,759
um in the '90s late '90s

209
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:37,519
who basically described uh some of these

210
00:09:35,759 --> 00:09:40,958
early root stocks that we're looking at

211
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:43,399
and what the growth characteristics were

212
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:46,639
we had uh and

213
00:09:43,399 --> 00:09:49,559
basically uh the new the peach root

214
00:09:46,639 --> 00:09:52,799
stocks Li are affected or limited shoot

215
00:09:49,559 --> 00:09:55,119
length growth that is uh and that was

216
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:56,240
basically the inner node lengths but not

217
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:59,879
the number of

218
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:02,200
nodes and trunk girth was was decreased

219
00:09:59,879 --> 00:10:05,159
in the number as we saw already in the

220
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:07,519
previous slide or slides ago and the

221
00:10:05,159 --> 00:10:09,639
number of and length of of water sprouts

222
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:12,720
the epicormic

223
00:10:09,639 --> 00:10:14,600
shoots uh tended to be less with the

224
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:17,759
with the sight controlling root

225
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:20,240
stocks and there was a hint that the

226
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:24,120
trees on dwarfing root stocks had no

227
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:25,839
lower uh uh more more negative midday

228
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:28,639
stem water

229
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:31,640
potentials So based on that work uh that

230
00:10:28,639 --> 00:10:35,838
early the descriptive

231
00:10:31,639 --> 00:10:38,039
work um and on a study that I a previous

232
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:42,720
student of mine

233
00:10:38,039 --> 00:10:46,039
did uh we showed that shoot extension

234
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:48,920
growth is is a linear function of the

235
00:10:46,039 --> 00:10:51,799
temperature and late and the rate of

236
00:10:48,919 --> 00:10:56,360
change of of stem's water potential in

237
00:10:51,799 --> 00:10:58,838
in peaches now this is a little bit

238
00:10:56,360 --> 00:11:01,519
counterintuitive because uh before you

239
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:04,720
look look at that

240
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:08,600
so what time of

241
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:12,160
day is a shoot growth the

242
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:14,360
greatest shoot extension growth what

243
00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:16,679
type of day is shoot extension growth

244
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:19,200
the greatest in a fruit

245
00:11:16,679 --> 00:11:23,599
tree early in the morning early in the

246
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:25,240
morning why because the uh D because the

247
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,879
water potential is water potential is

248
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:30,959
the highest yep okay anybody else want

249
00:11:27,879 --> 00:11:30,958
to guess

250
00:11:34,919 --> 00:11:42,519
why yeah you got sugar accumulation yeah

251
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:45,879
all right so it turns out that contrary

252
00:11:42,519 --> 00:11:48,519
to the water water hypothesis

253
00:11:45,879 --> 00:11:51,519
afternoon is the is the period of most

254
00:11:48,519 --> 00:11:53,399
rapid stem extension growth so this is

255
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:57,799
this is the the extension growth right

256
00:11:53,399 --> 00:12:01,799
here and you see that it its

257
00:11:57,799 --> 00:12:05,759
peak is is about

258
00:12:01,799 --> 00:12:08,240
6:00 1,800 hours most people because

259
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:11,240
they're so fixated on water relations

260
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:13,799
immediately talk think about the mid the

261
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:17,278
the dawn water potential being a driver

262
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:20,399
but in fact temperature temperature is

263
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:24,039
is one of the most significant factors

264
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:26,639
ever driving growth and availability of

265
00:12:24,039 --> 00:12:29,039
carbohydrates Le Lang is focused on

266
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:31,399
carbohydrates so that's involved there

267
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:33,480
but anyway we could we we could uh

268
00:12:31,399 --> 00:12:35,799
basically model this stem extension

269
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:39,440
growth rate as a function a linear

270
00:12:35,799 --> 00:12:42,879
function of of

271
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:45,079
um the recovery the recovery of water

272
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:47,879
Potential from the midday

273
00:12:45,078 --> 00:12:51,838
low the rate of recovery of water

274
00:12:47,879 --> 00:12:54,120
Potential from the midday low plus the

275
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:56,519
temperature uh and so we got a fairly

276
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:58,519
good regression of that well so under

277
00:12:56,519 --> 00:13:00,759
really realizing that or understanding

278
00:12:58,519 --> 00:13:02,278
that I went back and we thought okay

279
00:13:00,759 --> 00:13:03,198
let's take a look at these root stocks

280
00:13:02,278 --> 00:13:06,278
in the

281
00:13:03,198 --> 00:13:11,000
field so we did this experiment with

282
00:13:06,278 --> 00:13:12,559
nagard hawaa and uh K1 14643 which is

283
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:16,720
controller five

284
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:19,679
now um and and this a range there's a

285
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:22,079
range of uh size reduction and sure

286
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:25,719
enough that we did this uh we did these

287
00:13:22,078 --> 00:13:28,519
dial patterns of of extension growth

288
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:29,600
rate uh relative extension growth rate

289
00:13:28,519 --> 00:13:32,759
and

290
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:35,639
and stem mid and stem water potential

291
00:13:32,759 --> 00:13:38,120
over the day and sure enough the the

292
00:13:35,639 --> 00:13:41,000
most size controlling had the most

293
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:44,560
negative minimum water potential and so

294
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:46,278
forth and and as the spring warmed up

295
00:13:44,559 --> 00:13:50,879
that those differences especially with

296
00:13:46,278 --> 00:13:54,198
the with the uh controller 5 or the K

297
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:57,679
14643 was much negative more negative

298
00:13:54,198 --> 00:14:00,719
and and this was as the spring kept

299
00:13:57,679 --> 00:14:03,919
going but but then as as he end up in

300
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:07,680
June the differences became a little bit

301
00:14:03,919 --> 00:14:09,759
less but so when we put that all

302
00:14:07,679 --> 00:14:13,239
together we we came up with this sort of

303
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:19,278
integrated daily stem uh fluctuation in

304
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:20,360
in megap pascals per hour and uh the the

305
00:14:19,278 --> 00:14:25,439
K1

306
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:28,199
14643 was was the most affected or uh

307
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:30,079
had the lowest integrated uh water

308
00:14:28,198 --> 00:14:33,958
potential fluctuation and then the

309
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:36,359
highwa in between and thenard here so it

310
00:14:33,958 --> 00:14:38,479
uh convinced us that yes indeed the

311
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:40,680
water relations thing is something going

312
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:42,600
on with water relations and this is this

313
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:43,519
is the water sprout length or epicormic

314
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:45,879
shoot

315
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:47,600
length uh in those same trees that we

316
00:14:45,879 --> 00:14:50,559
were looking at this other and this is

317
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:53,879
accumulated integrated stem

318
00:14:50,559 --> 00:14:55,039
fluctuation and we uh we again a very

319
00:14:53,879 --> 00:14:57,439
good

320
00:14:55,039 --> 00:14:59,480
relationship the length of water sprouts

321
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:02,920
which grow sort of in terminant through

322
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:07,120
the whole season and this and this

323
00:15:02,919 --> 00:15:10,958
uh and and water and and and stem water

324
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:12,480
potential so then I um so we were now

325
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:14,119
fairly convinced that water potential

326
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:17,159
had something to do with

327
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:19,959
it then I had another student Luis

328
00:15:17,159 --> 00:15:21,919
salari uh and we decided okay in order

329
00:15:19,958 --> 00:15:24,638
to nail us down we should we should

330
00:15:21,919 --> 00:15:28,198
manipulate water

331
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:32,480
potential so what we did was uh or what

332
00:15:28,198 --> 00:15:34,399
he I should say you know professors

333
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:36,360
faculty always say we but it's really

334
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:38,240
the student that does all the

335
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:42,079
work

336
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:44,360
uh nevertheless I'll continue to say we

337
00:15:42,078 --> 00:15:47,838
uh anyway what he what we did what he

338
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:48,879
did was he wrapped the the Chute to stop

339
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:51,199
the

340
00:15:48,879 --> 00:15:52,720
transpiration and then put this this

341
00:15:51,198 --> 00:15:56,799
sort of

342
00:15:52,720 --> 00:16:00,000
um insulating this like a space blanket

343
00:15:56,799 --> 00:16:02,359
material over the top and so that the

344
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:06,799
shoots didn't heat up and and he either

345
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:08,720
he either covered zero 30% or 60% of the

346
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:10,799
canopy with this with this

347
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:13,800
material

348
00:16:10,799 --> 00:16:18,078
uh in the evening

349
00:16:13,799 --> 00:16:20,078
before a warm summer day and the idea

350
00:16:18,078 --> 00:16:22,078
here it was to see whether we could

351
00:16:20,078 --> 00:16:24,159
manipulate water potential and get get a

352
00:16:22,078 --> 00:16:27,799
range of water potentials and still see

353
00:16:24,159 --> 00:16:29,399
this change in in in uh stem extension

354
00:16:27,799 --> 00:16:32,039
growth rate

355
00:16:29,399 --> 00:16:34,839
so basically by doing and on he did that

356
00:16:32,039 --> 00:16:37,919
on the three root stocks so nagard hawaa

357
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:41,160
and k146 are controller

358
00:16:37,919 --> 00:16:44,039
five and you see immediately that the

359
00:16:41,159 --> 00:16:47,559
this is the uh stem water

360
00:16:44,039 --> 00:16:49,318
potential and always uh the the more

361
00:16:47,559 --> 00:16:51,919
dwarf remot stock had a lower water

362
00:16:49,318 --> 00:16:54,278
potential but we could indeed raise that

363
00:16:51,919 --> 00:16:56,360
water potential by covering 30 or

364
00:16:54,278 --> 00:16:59,039
60% of the

365
00:16:56,360 --> 00:17:02,079
canopy uh and so that we had basically

366
00:16:59,039 --> 00:17:06,798
overlapping water potentials uh between

367
00:17:02,078 --> 00:17:09,480
the nagard and the and the uh High waa

368
00:17:06,798 --> 00:17:12,639
in

369
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:14,880
14643 and we did that we this is the

370
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:17,720
relative stem extension growth rate and

371
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:19,480
then we get a corresponding overlap in

372
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:20,880
stem extension growth rate so there's a

373
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:23,279
direct

374
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:25,120
correlation on the three root stocks

375
00:17:23,279 --> 00:17:27,078
three different root stocks directly

376
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:29,279
related to water

377
00:17:27,078 --> 00:17:33,000
potential so

378
00:17:29,279 --> 00:17:35,119
uh and this this shows the

379
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,079
relationship more clearly as a graph

380
00:17:35,119 --> 00:17:39,639
with all with all the points on

381
00:17:37,079 --> 00:17:42,879
it differing amounts of cover of

382
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:45,038
coverage and so forth all put together

383
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:46,400
so they're there're appears to be a

384
00:17:45,038 --> 00:17:50,798
direct

385
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:52,480
relationship of that so then and then uh

386
00:17:50,798 --> 00:17:53,400
when that experiment was done with a

387
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:59,519
small

388
00:17:53,400 --> 00:18:04,880
trees he uh we we used a um

389
00:17:59,519 --> 00:18:07,079
a uh hydraulic pressure uh machine to

390
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:10,080
measure to measure specific hydraulic

391
00:18:07,079 --> 00:18:14,639
inductance of of the plant of the of the

392
00:18:10,079 --> 00:18:17,000
Chute the root and uh or the Chute part

393
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:19,400
and the root part and then put them

394
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:22,359
together the whole tree so basically

395
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:23,798
what you do is you cut the tree off you

396
00:18:22,359 --> 00:18:25,959
measure the hydraulic conductance of the

397
00:18:23,798 --> 00:18:28,079
upper part and then you turn the thing

398
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:30,759
around and put it on the root and force

399
00:18:28,079 --> 00:18:32,798
the water backwards through there uh

400
00:18:30,759 --> 00:18:35,960
there's a little bit

401
00:18:32,798 --> 00:18:37,558
of concern about forcing whether forcing

402
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:39,279
water backward through the root is the

403
00:18:37,558 --> 00:18:41,079
right thing to do but nevertheless you

404
00:18:39,279 --> 00:18:43,798
still get you still get these

405
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:46,158
differences so assuming that the

406
00:18:43,798 --> 00:18:47,798
differen would be relative you see that

407
00:18:46,159 --> 00:18:49,559
when there's no

408
00:18:47,798 --> 00:18:52,519
difference uh

409
00:18:49,558 --> 00:18:54,759
between uh the treatments with a s so

410
00:18:52,519 --> 00:18:58,319
all of these had the same n uh the same

411
00:18:54,759 --> 00:18:59,599
s on top same Peach s on top I forgot EX

412
00:18:58,319 --> 00:19:02,599
exactly what it was but they're all the

413
00:18:59,599 --> 00:19:04,678
same but they're just on different root

414
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:06,319
stocks uh but the root stock

415
00:19:04,679 --> 00:19:11,360
consistently

416
00:19:06,319 --> 00:19:13,798
had um nagard the root of nagard had a a

417
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:16,000
higher specific hydraulic least specific

418
00:19:13,798 --> 00:19:19,759
hydraulic

419
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:23,240
conductance uh and so the the difference

420
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:23,240
was in the root stock not in the

421
00:19:23,839 --> 00:19:29,240
Canan uh and then this

422
00:19:26,279 --> 00:19:32,599
student uh that wasn't quite enough for

423
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:35,679
him so we did this additional experiment

424
00:19:32,599 --> 00:19:37,599
where we put the the plants in these

425
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:39,880
these Chambers we grew the plants in the

426
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:41,399
chambers for a number of years he had a

427
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:43,640
whole slew of other ones that he did

428
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:46,159
some other experiments but the these

429
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:50,880
Chambers you're able to we're able to uh

430
00:19:46,159 --> 00:19:53,640
seal them up and and apply uh pressure

431
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:57,400
air pressure to the bottom while they're

432
00:19:53,640 --> 00:20:00,000
while they're uh growing and we moved

433
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:03,360
them to a growth chamber and did this

434
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:06,000
work and um this kind of work has been

435
00:20:03,359 --> 00:20:09,279
done before with other plants it's sort

436
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:12,640
of it sort of documents that yes water

437
00:20:09,279 --> 00:20:14,720
potential actually works and and the

438
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:19,360
system as we think of it actually works

439
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:23,440
you apply pressure to the to root stock

440
00:20:19,359 --> 00:20:25,798
or to the roots and you you can indeed

441
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:32,159
as you apply pressure the leaf water

442
00:20:25,798 --> 00:20:34,558
potential of the of of the S uh changes

443
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:36,520
proportionally so you apply pressure and

444
00:20:34,558 --> 00:20:39,319
the root and the root stock water I mean

445
00:20:36,519 --> 00:20:42,480
the S water potential increases it

446
00:20:39,319 --> 00:20:44,319
maintain the difference between the the

447
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:47,480
two root stocks so in this case we just

448
00:20:44,319 --> 00:20:50,359
had two the nagard versus the controller

449
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:50,360
5 or K1

450
00:20:50,558 --> 00:20:56,399
14643 and and so the the more negative

451
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:58,159
one is the is the controller five or the

452
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:01,320
dwarfing root stock and the other one is

453
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:05,120
is the vigorous root

454
00:21:01,319 --> 00:21:06,839
stock so the so the relative extension

455
00:21:05,119 --> 00:21:09,599
uh and and this is the corresponding

456
00:21:06,839 --> 00:21:12,439
relative extension growth rate of these

457
00:21:09,599 --> 00:21:14,000
root stocks I mean of the chotes so

458
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:16,320
again we can manipulate the water

459
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,759
potential and we by doing so we

460
00:21:16,319 --> 00:21:24,319
manipulate the shoot extension growth

461
00:21:18,759 --> 00:21:27,519
rate so sort of nails it in terms of yes

462
00:21:24,319 --> 00:21:30,119
indeed um the rate of growth or the rate

463
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:32,319
of steming extension growth on the roof

464
00:21:30,119 --> 00:21:35,639
stock is directly related to water water

465
00:21:32,319 --> 00:21:39,639
relations and and he also measured then

466
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:42,080
the the uh the hydraulic

467
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:45,919
conductance again Lea specific hydraulic

468
00:21:42,079 --> 00:21:49,158
conductance of these two and and again

469
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:51,000
the Canan not really well in this case

470
00:21:49,159 --> 00:21:53,520
slightly different but not a whole lot

471
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:56,079
different but the but the root stock is

472
00:21:53,519 --> 00:21:57,038
where most of the difference was between

473
00:21:56,079 --> 00:22:00,038
here and

474
00:21:57,038 --> 00:22:00,038
here

475
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:07,159
uh so then I had this this visiting

476
00:22:03,359 --> 00:22:09,918
scientist from Italy came and

477
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:12,559
um and he said you know you've done all

478
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:14,200
this stuff I read all your papers and it

479
00:22:12,558 --> 00:22:16,319
would be interesting to look at the ZM

480
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:17,679
Anatomy I said well certainly it can't

481
00:22:16,319 --> 00:22:20,798
be that

482
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:25,038
easy this whole thing can't be that

483
00:22:20,798 --> 00:22:30,038
simple uh but uh he went went ahead and

484
00:22:25,038 --> 00:22:32,319
he he measured uh The xylm Vessel

485
00:22:30,038 --> 00:22:34,640
characteristics and and then calculated

486
00:22:32,319 --> 00:22:36,319
axial hydraulic conductance of the size

487
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:39,840
of the size controlling root stocks and

488
00:22:36,319 --> 00:22:42,798
in this case he did nagard and the

489
00:22:39,839 --> 00:22:46,079
controller 9 and controller

490
00:22:42,798 --> 00:22:51,000
five uh and sure enough he got

491
00:22:46,079 --> 00:22:55,319
differences in in the these are classes

492
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:58,919
of um root uh root size

493
00:22:55,319 --> 00:23:03,639
categories and uh in in the

494
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:06,320
in and and this is so this is now the

495
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:09,559
choots of of each one of these so these

496
00:23:06,319 --> 00:23:11,678
are these are actually these were taking

497
00:23:09,558 --> 00:23:14,519
from our from our foundation Plant

498
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:19,600
Services block where we have that's used

499
00:23:14,519 --> 00:23:22,400
for distribution of of of um grafting

500
00:23:19,599 --> 00:23:25,038
wood or rooting wood and so these are

501
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:26,960
actual shoots of the root stock here

502
00:23:25,038 --> 00:23:29,119
these are the trunks of the root stock

503
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:31,759
and these are the roots of the root

504
00:23:29,119 --> 00:23:35,000
stocks and so we saw these consistent

505
00:23:31,759 --> 00:23:38,640
differences again in all these parts of

506
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:43,640
of having uh a greater number of of

507
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:46,400
large siiz vessels in the more uh more

508
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:49,120
vigorous root stocks and and a greater

509
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:52,840
proportion of smaller side vessel in the

510
00:23:49,119 --> 00:23:52,839
in the more uh dwarfing root

511
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:59,798
stocks and uh if you put all this

512
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:03,880
together and calculate weed weighted

513
00:23:59,798 --> 00:24:05,079
mean vessel diameters you see that uh

514
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:07,559
that

515
00:24:05,079 --> 00:24:11,639
consistently well fairly consistently at

516
00:24:07,558 --> 00:24:13,599
least uh the the nagard regardless of

517
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:16,960
whether you looked at the shoots the

518
00:24:13,599 --> 00:24:18,678
trunks or the roots had the largest mean

519
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:21,400
weighted mean vessel

520
00:24:18,679 --> 00:24:22,798
diameters and the the next one had the

521
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:26,480
intermediate and the most size

522
00:24:22,798 --> 00:24:29,480
controlling had had the next most or

523
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:32,558
next smallest vessels

524
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:34,519
so it did seem to be directly related to

525
00:24:32,558 --> 00:24:39,720
vessel diameter and and it is seem it

526
00:24:34,519 --> 00:24:43,278
does seem to be uh as simple as just the

527
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:46,038
anatomy of the of the root

528
00:24:43,278 --> 00:24:48,640
stock and then when you calculate the C

529
00:24:46,038 --> 00:24:51,919
he used this these

530
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:54,000
data uh in vessel diameter weighted mean

531
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:56,840
vessel diameters and so on to calculate

532
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:59,240
the the theoretical xylm conductance

533
00:24:56,839 --> 00:25:04,319
based on the

534
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:07,319
uh pyol law which is basically the

535
00:25:04,319 --> 00:25:10,798
the the conductance or the resistance

536
00:25:07,319 --> 00:25:13,558
conductance through a vessel or a a pipe

537
00:25:10,798 --> 00:25:15,720
is is a function of the of the radius to

538
00:25:13,558 --> 00:25:19,359
the fourth

539
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:22,038
power and and and sure enough no matter

540
00:25:19,359 --> 00:25:25,359
what you looked at

541
00:25:22,038 --> 00:25:28,119
nagard had the highest uh conduct

542
00:25:25,359 --> 00:25:30,479
calculated theoretical conductance and

543
00:25:28,119 --> 00:25:36,558
the others fell in

544
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:39,960
line so we're fairly fairly certain that

545
00:25:36,558 --> 00:25:43,960
um that we had a story here but then we

546
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:45,640
we also wanted to know whether uh how

547
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:48,480
much influenced

548
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:50,960
because there is the notion that the the

549
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:53,159
root stock will influ influence the

550
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:56,679
anatomy of the scian or vice

551
00:25:53,159 --> 00:26:02,360
versa and so we did we had a tree where

552
00:25:56,679 --> 00:26:02,360
we uh well no wait this is

553
00:26:06,558 --> 00:26:14,158
uh yeah so this is the S the a s on on

554
00:26:12,119 --> 00:26:18,199
each of the root stocks versus the root

555
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:22,240
stock and so this is uh and

556
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:25,558
U and so you see the S was

557
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:29,399
basically identical across when when

558
00:26:25,558 --> 00:26:31,519
when grafted on the three root stocks

559
00:26:29,398 --> 00:26:34,359
but the root stock maintain their

560
00:26:31,519 --> 00:26:38,359
differences just like we saw

561
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:41,879
before and um and this is the the the

562
00:26:38,359 --> 00:26:46,719
calculated hydraulic conductance of

563
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:49,640
those again showing that that indeed the

564
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:51,120
Canan more or less stayed the same and

565
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:53,320
it was all in the root

566
00:26:51,119 --> 00:26:55,558
stock and then we happened to have some

567
00:26:53,319 --> 00:26:58,240
trees that where we where we would put

568
00:26:55,558 --> 00:27:00,079
where he had put uh controller n as an

569
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:02,599
inter

570
00:27:00,079 --> 00:27:06,158
stem and we had Oh Henry which is a

571
00:27:02,599 --> 00:27:07,240
vigorous San and nagard was a vigorous

572
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:11,159
root

573
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:14,079
stock and uh we looked

574
00:27:11,159 --> 00:27:16,399
at the theoretical hydraulic we looked

575
00:27:14,079 --> 00:27:19,398
at the The xylm Vessel characteristics

576
00:27:16,398 --> 00:27:21,879
again in this combination with a with a

577
00:27:19,398 --> 00:27:26,158
vigorous root stock down in the

578
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:28,360
bottom uh an inter stem here and a

579
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:30,799
vigorous s on top

580
00:27:28,359 --> 00:27:32,639
and we looked at the uh theoretical

581
00:27:30,798 --> 00:27:34,679
hydraulic calculated well we looked at

582
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:37,200
the he looked at the vessel sizes and

583
00:27:34,679 --> 00:27:39,320
all that and calculated a weighted mean

584
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:40,960
vessel diameter and all that and then

585
00:27:39,319 --> 00:27:43,480
calculated theoretical hydraulic

586
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:46,600
inductance and sure enough it came out

587
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:49,159
that that basically the the the most

588
00:27:46,599 --> 00:27:52,678
dwarfing root stock when used in an in

589
00:27:49,159 --> 00:27:54,840
stem had no effect in either direction

590
00:27:52,679 --> 00:27:57,640
on the on the vessel diameter vessel

591
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:59,759
anatomy of of of the root stock of the

592
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:59,759
the

593
00:28:00,278 --> 00:28:03,278
others

594
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:12,759
um then we had this series you notice

595
00:28:09,319 --> 00:28:14,678
remember I I talked about uh we had we

596
00:28:12,759 --> 00:28:17,879
had four additional root stocks that we'

597
00:28:14,679 --> 00:28:21,399
released so he looked at the anatomy The

598
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:24,120
Vessel characteristics of those four and

599
00:28:21,398 --> 00:28:27,959
again

600
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:33,359
um we saw that that the uh the prim

601
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:35,919
AR the tri the primary uh effect was on

602
00:28:33,359 --> 00:28:39,719
the was was on the

603
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:43,840
roots and that it was in line with the

604
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:46,558
with the with the U the dwarfing

605
00:28:43,839 --> 00:28:49,720
characteristics there was also in this

606
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:54,158
case I looked at the trunks as well let

607
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:57,399
me see here so then we had a I had a uh

608
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:59,559
just last year I had a a geneticist

609
00:28:57,398 --> 00:29:01,319
breeder a peach breeder who was

610
00:28:59,558 --> 00:29:02,398
interested in Peach root stocks come

611
00:29:01,319 --> 00:29:04,879
from

612
00:29:02,398 --> 00:29:07,719
Brazil and he said well if that's the

613
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:09,080
case we should be able to figure out we

614
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:11,839
if we're going to breed root stocks in

615
00:29:09,079 --> 00:29:14,359
the future it'd be really

616
00:29:11,839 --> 00:29:16,079
interesting if we could use this as a

617
00:29:14,359 --> 00:29:19,519
selection tool but it but it's going to

618
00:29:16,079 --> 00:29:22,439
have to be simpler than than what tomasi

619
00:29:19,519 --> 00:29:24,519
did because tomasi you looked at he did

620
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:27,759
a lot of calculations very laborious and

621
00:29:24,519 --> 00:29:31,038
so on so what this so what cloudy

622
00:29:27,759 --> 00:29:32,919
Brookner did was he he looked for some

623
00:29:31,038 --> 00:29:36,038
very simple characteristics that you

624
00:29:32,919 --> 00:29:39,159
could look at doing cross-section of of

625
00:29:36,038 --> 00:29:43,359
shoots of these of these uh different

626
00:29:39,159 --> 00:29:46,720
root stocks and he came up with with

627
00:29:43,359 --> 00:29:49,038
the the the number of vessels around the

628
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:53,519
largest vessel over the number of

629
00:29:49,038 --> 00:29:56,480
vessels of nagard so uh so basically he

630
00:29:53,519 --> 00:29:59,640
he developed a simple selection criteria

631
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:02,200
by which he felt as as a plant breeder

632
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:03,840
he would he would uh and then he tested

633
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:06,720
whether he would be able to sort them

634
00:30:03,839 --> 00:30:10,759
out or not depending on if he had a 10%

635
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:13,640
or a 15% or a 20% sort of variance in in

636
00:30:10,759 --> 00:30:15,640
the selection criteria and he decided

637
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:17,919
that yes he could certainly he could

638
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:19,519
certainly sort out the more size

639
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:23,640
controlling root Stocks by having a

640
00:30:19,519 --> 00:30:25,038
quick a simple a simple assay like this

641
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:27,399
so

642
00:30:25,038 --> 00:30:29,398
um so he's hopeful that he could

643
00:30:27,398 --> 00:30:32,079
actually use this sort of information in

644
00:30:29,398 --> 00:30:34,759
his in his root stock breeding

645
00:30:32,079 --> 00:30:40,639
program so now we're going back to the

646
00:30:34,759 --> 00:30:42,278
beak Bane uh question and how can zylin

647
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:44,360
vessel diameter and theoretical

648
00:30:42,278 --> 00:30:48,038
hydraulic inductance of the outer rings

649
00:30:44,359 --> 00:30:49,959
of the xylm which is what we measured be

650
00:30:48,038 --> 00:30:52,000
limiting when there appears to be an

651
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:54,120
excess of xylm

652
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:56,240
capacity in other words why weren't

653
00:30:54,119 --> 00:30:57,918
Rogers and Beak Bane

654
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:00,960
correct

655
00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:03,080
uh so I've been troubled by this for for

656
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:06,840
actually quite a few

657
00:31:03,079 --> 00:31:08,319
years and we did an uh tomasi came back

658
00:31:06,839 --> 00:31:11,720
we did this short

659
00:31:08,319 --> 00:31:15,158
experiment a couple years

660
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:17,798
ago and the experiment the experiment

661
00:31:15,159 --> 00:31:21,360
was basically we did girdling so in

662
00:31:17,798 --> 00:31:22,960
California for our Peach production

663
00:31:21,359 --> 00:31:24,638
especially early maturing Peach

664
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:26,679
production it's actually quite common

665
00:31:24,638 --> 00:31:27,918
that that we will the grower will girdle

666
00:31:26,679 --> 00:31:30,559
the trees

667
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:33,759
which basically means you take a qu inch

668
00:31:30,558 --> 00:31:36,079
ring of bark out uh in the spring 6

669
00:31:33,759 --> 00:31:38,398
weeks before Harvest six weeks before

670
00:31:36,079 --> 00:31:40,918
your anticipated Harvest you take that

671
00:31:38,398 --> 00:31:45,199
that ring of of bark off there down to

672
00:31:40,919 --> 00:31:47,799
the cambium and then and then

673
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:49,519
um that artificially holds the

674
00:31:47,798 --> 00:31:52,599
carbohydrates in the upper part of the

675
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:54,638
tree makes the fruit larger and it makes

676
00:31:52,599 --> 00:31:57,240
it about three three or four or five

677
00:31:54,638 --> 00:31:58,759
days earlier and the tree doesn't die I

678
00:31:57,240 --> 00:32:01,278
mean contrary

679
00:31:58,759 --> 00:32:04,480
to all the stuff about girdling the tree

680
00:32:01,278 --> 00:32:08,720
doesn't die the the if you only do that

681
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:11,599
a quter inch the it grows callous across

682
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:14,000
the girdle and by by the time of harvest

683
00:32:11,599 --> 00:32:16,879
the girdle's mended again the tree looks

684
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:18,759
a little sick but but it recovers and

685
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:21,840
you can do this year after year after

686
00:32:18,759 --> 00:32:22,798
year so we did that and we did two two

687
00:32:21,839 --> 00:32:25,199
times of

688
00:32:22,798 --> 00:32:27,960
girdling an early girdle and a late

689
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:31,480
girdle and our hypothesis was that well

690
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:34,360
in most girdling people assume that it's

691
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:36,919
only the transport of sugars that's

692
00:32:34,359 --> 00:32:41,719
affected not the transport of

693
00:32:36,919 --> 00:32:43,919
water okay but we were we reasoned well

694
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:45,839
we're not so sure so this has been a

695
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:49,038
conundrum in the girdling literature for

696
00:32:45,839 --> 00:32:52,000
years why Chute growth is actually

697
00:32:49,038 --> 00:32:55,319
usually shorter on girdle

698
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:58,000
trees uh while fruit growth is

699
00:32:55,319 --> 00:33:00,480
larger because

700
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:02,200
uh the fruit growth is larger because

701
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:03,759
more carbohydrates held up in the tree

702
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:06,720
but why wouldn't that excess

703
00:33:03,759 --> 00:33:08,960
carbohydrate in the tree stimulate shoot

704
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:11,759
growth so this is a

705
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:13,360
problem uh that's been banging around in

706
00:33:11,759 --> 00:33:15,240
literature for a while so we did this

707
00:33:13,359 --> 00:33:17,479
experiment and then we looked at midday

708
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:20,159
stem water potentials after girdling so

709
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:22,000
here's the early girdle the midday stem

710
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:25,200
water potential of the of the early

711
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:27,759
girdle uh dropped significantly compared

712
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:31,880
to the control

713
00:33:27,759 --> 00:33:33,240
the controls the the the triangles here

714
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:37,639
and then the late

715
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:40,880
girdle it it dropped also relative to

716
00:33:37,638 --> 00:33:44,798
control but but both of them both of

717
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:46,360
them uh sort of caught up again so

718
00:33:44,798 --> 00:33:48,000
what's the interpretation here our

719
00:33:46,359 --> 00:33:50,119
interpretation is

720
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,720
that that the

721
00:33:50,119 --> 00:33:55,759
girdling not only

722
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:59,440
affected uh flum flow it affected xylm

723
00:33:55,759 --> 00:34:02,200
flow because when you girdle you're also

724
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:03,440
hitting the cambium so you're hitting

725
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:05,759
the

726
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:09,440
cambium that's going to stop the

727
00:34:05,759 --> 00:34:13,719
development of new of new flum I mean

728
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:15,918
new xylm for that period so new xylm uh

729
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:19,358
growth uh

730
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:21,279
stops and so until it until it rebounds

731
00:34:19,358 --> 00:34:24,759
you see this

732
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:28,040
effect and and there's also recently in

733
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:30,119
the last two or three four years

734
00:34:28,039 --> 00:34:33,320
there's mounting evidence that water

735
00:34:30,119 --> 00:34:36,280
transport trees in ring por Asylum with

736
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:38,879
ring por Asylum relies per primarily on

737
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:44,440
the most recently formed ring of xylm

738
00:34:38,878 --> 00:34:44,440
maybe two rings of xylm and in fact

739
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:51,279
uh oh this is the this is the number of

740
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:53,679
water sprouts for tree uh it also

741
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:55,320
affected the number of water sprouts per

742
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:57,440
tree and and so

743
00:34:55,320 --> 00:35:00,320
on um

744
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:02,240
but uh there are there is something

745
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:05,079
published in the in the literature way

746
00:35:02,239 --> 00:35:07,679
back in 1890 that said that

747
00:35:05,079 --> 00:35:10,839
robinia if you girdled

748
00:35:07,679 --> 00:35:12,279
robinia uh some at a particular time of

749
00:35:10,838 --> 00:35:14,799
the year the tree would

750
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:16,400
die if you did this light girdle whereas

751
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:18,560
if if you did it in the spring but if

752
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:20,039
you did it in the in the fall there was

753
00:35:18,559 --> 00:35:22,838
no

754
00:35:20,039 --> 00:35:25,000
effect so this is sort of consistent

755
00:35:22,838 --> 00:35:27,480
with that and and and and people that

756
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:30,880
are doing the hydraulic conductance me

757
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:32,480
uh with the with the probes they're also

758
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:35,358
finding that if you put the probe too

759
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:37,800
deep you don't you can't measure the

760
00:35:35,358 --> 00:35:39,519
hydraulic conductance nearly as well as

761
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:42,440
if you if you keep it in the outer

762
00:35:39,519 --> 00:35:45,159
layers of xylm so there's increasing uh

763
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:46,720
recognition that it is the hour later Z

764
00:35:45,159 --> 00:35:50,679
that's important so this goes back to

765
00:35:46,719 --> 00:35:53,519
the root stock thing because if

766
00:35:50,679 --> 00:35:55,000
transport of the water transport in the

767
00:35:53,519 --> 00:35:57,358
plant is

768
00:35:55,000 --> 00:36:00,480
primarily uh uh

769
00:35:57,358 --> 00:36:04,598
uh dependent on the last year or the

770
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:06,000
current new growing uh xylm as well as

771
00:36:04,599 --> 00:36:09,640
maybe the last year's Island that's

772
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:11,838
going to have an influence on having

773
00:36:09,639 --> 00:36:14,400
smaller vessels in the root stock will

774
00:36:11,838 --> 00:36:17,799
have an influence on the water potential

775
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:20,240
of those plants and so I think we have a

776
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:23,359
story so

777
00:36:20,239 --> 00:36:26,479
basically the most recent ring is that

778
00:36:23,358 --> 00:36:28,759
current years XY well obviously there's

779
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:30,639
some movement in the previous year xylm

780
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:32,880
but the the efficiency of the current

781
00:36:30,639 --> 00:36:34,879
year xylm is thought to be much as it's

782
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:37,039
developing is supposed to be thought to

783
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:40,960
be much higher than the previous year

784
00:36:37,039 --> 00:36:45,000
xylm and I think this varies by species

785
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:48,880
probably um but anyway so a summary of

786
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:50,559
of the way we think about this now is

787
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:53,280
that of how the root stocks of peach

788
00:36:50,559 --> 00:36:55,239
root stocks work is that the DI the

789
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:56,680
diameter of the water conducting vessels

790
00:36:55,239 --> 00:36:58,559
of the dwarf and root stock are small

791
00:36:56,679 --> 00:37:00,199
smaller this causes the hydraulic

792
00:36:58,559 --> 00:37:03,400
conductance of the root stock in the

793
00:37:00,199 --> 00:37:05,519
water conducting tissue to be lower this

794
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:07,920
causes the water availability or water

795
00:37:05,519 --> 00:37:10,199
potential in the stems and leaves to be

796
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:12,960
slightly

797
00:37:10,199 --> 00:37:15,078
less this causes the elongation of stems

798
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:17,039
to be slightly less and overall Vigor of

799
00:37:15,079 --> 00:37:18,880
the tree is decreased over time and this

800
00:37:17,039 --> 00:37:21,759
is particularly true of the water sprout

801
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:23,680
parts of the the epicormic shoots uh

802
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:27,640
this decreases the amount of pruning

803
00:37:23,679 --> 00:37:29,879
needed the decreased pruning reduces the

804
00:37:27,639 --> 00:37:32,000
number of water

805
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:34,119
sprouts uh that are produced in the

806
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:36,079
following year because if water sprouts

807
00:37:34,119 --> 00:37:37,440
are produced in response to pruning

808
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:40,119
pretty much

809
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:42,720
only uh and this decreases the need for

810
00:37:40,119 --> 00:37:45,039
pruning even more so you have a cumula

811
00:37:42,719 --> 00:37:48,318
effect of less

812
00:37:45,039 --> 00:37:51,039
pruning and this decreases the internal

813
00:37:48,318 --> 00:37:53,239
canopy shading and thus increases shoot

814
00:37:51,039 --> 00:37:54,759
quality and flower Bud development we I

815
00:37:53,239 --> 00:37:58,039
don't show you data on that but

816
00:37:54,760 --> 00:38:00,119
typically the bloom on the on the size

817
00:37:58,039 --> 00:38:02,639
controlling root stocks is much heavier

818
00:38:00,119 --> 00:38:04,640
than the Bloom on the doring on the

819
00:38:02,639 --> 00:38:06,799
vigorous root

820
00:38:04,639 --> 00:38:12,039
stocks

821
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:15,839
um yeah so uh question is can we

822
00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:17,960
simulate this so I've done a lot of work

823
00:38:15,838 --> 00:38:20,159
with what we call the L Peach model it's

824
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:22,639
a lyen l stands for lynen Meer it's a

825
00:38:20,159 --> 00:38:26,000
particular modeling language and I'll

826
00:38:22,639 --> 00:38:30,279
just show you uh uh a movie of the

827
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:33,800
simulation of of of the growth of two

828
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:35,920
peach trees one on one on a on a

829
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:38,119
vigorous root stock and one in which the

830
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:42,318
hydraulic conductance of the root stock

831
00:38:38,119 --> 00:38:44,880
only is reduced by 50% and so if we can

832
00:38:42,318 --> 00:38:48,119
get this to

833
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:50,680
run um out of this and then we'll click

834
00:38:48,119 --> 00:38:50,680
on the

835
00:38:50,719 --> 00:38:56,919
video Let's see see if see if it'll I

836
00:38:54,358 --> 00:38:59,440
might have to go out and yeah go out

837
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:59,440
let's get this

838
00:39:00,559 --> 00:39:07,559
one okay let

839
00:39:02,559 --> 00:39:11,519
me um music with it too yeah there

840
00:39:07,559 --> 00:39:12,960
is okay so what we have here are three

841
00:39:11,519 --> 00:39:17,079
identical

842
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:20,960
trees uh the first uh two years have

843
00:39:17,079 --> 00:39:23,560
already been simulated so uh the the

844
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:25,440
initial year in the nursery and the

845
00:39:23,559 --> 00:39:27,199
first year then then in the nursery

846
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:30,280
after they they grown in nursery for a

847
00:39:27,199 --> 00:39:32,358
year they grow they grow a main stem

848
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:34,880
that's that's in the way we grow the

849
00:39:32,358 --> 00:39:37,440
trees in California that main stem is

850
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:42,280
then hacked off at knee high

851
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:44,240
about and then you then you allow uh uh

852
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:46,960
shoots to grow out of that and then in

853
00:39:44,239 --> 00:39:49,399
the sub in the summer I mean the winter

854
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:51,199
of the subsequent year so after the

855
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:52,519
trees are really two years old one year

856
00:39:51,199 --> 00:39:55,879
in the

857
00:39:52,519 --> 00:39:58,559
orchard uh we have we have three types

858
00:39:55,880 --> 00:40:01,039
of pruning here so it's exactly the same

859
00:39:58,559 --> 00:40:02,519
tree uh simulated in each case but

860
00:40:01,039 --> 00:40:04,920
there's three different types of pruning

861
00:40:02,519 --> 00:40:06,639
this is what we call the Dinuba pruning

862
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:07,920
which there's a group of Growers very

863
00:40:06,639 --> 00:40:09,799
conservative growers in the southern

864
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:11,800
soken they like to have all their trees

865
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:14,160
to really just grow like heck in the in

866
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:16,800
the second year in the Orchard and so

867
00:40:14,159 --> 00:40:20,399
they prune them back to about a foot

868
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:22,920
stubs or 8 inch stubs three scaffolds

869
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:25,358
and a perpend on an open vase tree this

870
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:27,318
one's the same tree except it's sort of

871
00:40:25,358 --> 00:40:30,400
our standard recommend a that is that

872
00:40:27,318 --> 00:40:32,639
you leave these these scaffolds each to

873
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:36,039
be about a meter

874
00:40:32,639 --> 00:40:37,719
long uh and this

875
00:40:36,039 --> 00:40:42,358
is

876
00:40:37,719 --> 00:40:44,439
yeah anyway uh and then we have what

877
00:40:42,358 --> 00:40:46,559
Scott Johnson and and Kevin Day and

878
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:49,480
myself are sort of trying to promote is

879
00:40:46,559 --> 00:40:51,799
leaving the tree less hard pruned

880
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:53,599
selecting some of the fruiting wood off

881
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:57,119
of here and so on and then letting them

882
00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:59,480
go so we have a simulation now a movie

883
00:40:57,119 --> 00:41:01,039
of of this this subsequent one year's

884
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:02,880
worth of growth in this

885
00:41:01,039 --> 00:41:09,000
case

886
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:09,000
uh with for with music for your

887
00:41:09,039 --> 00:41:15,358
pleasure oh I should say what we're

888
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:18,039
doing uh I forgot to explain what the

889
00:41:15,358 --> 00:41:20,880
model does what the model does is

890
00:41:18,039 --> 00:41:22,440
basically uh it grows the tree and while

891
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:24,119
it's growing the the growth of the tree

892
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:25,838
is totally dependent on the carbon

893
00:41:24,119 --> 00:41:28,920
that's assimilated by the leaves of the

894
00:41:25,838 --> 00:41:31,239
tree it basically simulates the

895
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:35,599
photosynthetic output of every single

896
00:41:31,239 --> 00:41:38,118
leaf and um and then distribute then

897
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:41,400
that that carbohydrate is distributed

898
00:41:38,119 --> 00:41:43,400
around the tree uh according to the syn

899
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:44,838
strength of all the individual organs

900
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:46,358
that are on there and then we have a

901
00:41:44,838 --> 00:41:50,838
whole bunch

902
00:41:46,358 --> 00:41:52,639
of uh submodels in there dictating what

903
00:41:50,838 --> 00:41:54,199
the what individual Shoots look like

904
00:41:52,639 --> 00:41:57,400
depending on if they're epicormic or

905
00:41:54,199 --> 00:41:59,679
proleptic or what have you

906
00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:02,358
uh and

907
00:41:59,679 --> 00:42:03,799
um so you'll see the differences between

908
00:42:02,358 --> 00:42:07,880
the three these two are going to grow a

909
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:07,880
little bit of fruit as

910
00:42:12,559 --> 00:42:16,960
well so we have spring it's

911
00:42:24,838 --> 00:42:30,599
blooming if you look carefully you see

912
00:42:27,079 --> 00:42:30,599
some green fruit in here that turn

913
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:44,880
yellow we just had thinning there those

914
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:47,599
in the front you might have seen the

915
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:47,599
fruit some fruit

916
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:52,720
disappear it's simulating every hour of

917
00:42:51,639 --> 00:42:55,000
every

918
00:42:52,719 --> 00:42:58,159
day and now you're going to see Harvest

919
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:58,159
here pretty quick

920
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:17,760
there's

921
00:43:25,079 --> 00:43:28,079
Harvest

922
00:43:55,079 --> 00:43:58,079
ch

923
00:44:01,318 --> 00:44:08,119
so um if

924
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:09,720
you um I I should have stopped it but

925
00:44:08,119 --> 00:44:12,800
the tree on the left that was really

926
00:44:09,719 --> 00:44:15,879
hard pruned ended up to be almost the

927
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:18,640
same size as a tree in the center and

928
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:21,160
that's and that's because yeah stop

929
00:44:18,639 --> 00:44:23,358
there you go so this tree ended up to be

930
00:44:21,159 --> 00:44:25,838
almost the same size as this one and

931
00:44:23,358 --> 00:44:28,000
that's because by hard pruning like this

932
00:44:25,838 --> 00:44:29,880
we grew almost exclusively epicormic

933
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:32,480
shoots which have no stop Point

934
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:34,318
epicormic shoots grow differently than

935
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:36,000
and this one has some epicormic these

936
00:44:34,318 --> 00:44:37,519
really tall ones are the water sprouts

937
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:39,039
that came out of these high heads but

938
00:44:37,519 --> 00:44:41,358
there's many other shoots in here that

939
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:43,199
are proleptic shoots and this one of

940
00:44:41,358 --> 00:44:45,239
course had many many more proleptic

941
00:44:43,199 --> 00:44:47,318
shoots and still had a few epicormic

942
00:44:45,239 --> 00:44:49,639
shoots where we did a heading cut so it

943
00:44:47,318 --> 00:44:52,279
sort of it sort of explains how you can

944
00:44:49,639 --> 00:44:54,159
actually these Growers that do this are

945
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:56,280
are set on this because they get these

946
00:44:54,159 --> 00:44:58,960
very uniform trees they have lots of

947
00:44:56,280 --> 00:45:01,280
choices for secondary scaffolds and

948
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:03,400
everything um whereas you do these and

949
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:05,480
you have a little more random structure

950
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:07,519
because you're not forcing as much

951
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:10,119
growth but it explains why these guys

952
00:45:07,519 --> 00:45:11,759
can be satisfied with this as compared

953
00:45:10,119 --> 00:45:13,480
to the traditional system because by the

954
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:14,839
end of the season there's not that much

955
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:18,240
difference and that's really the way

956
00:45:14,838 --> 00:45:21,000
what happens in the field as well

957
00:45:18,239 --> 00:45:22,919
um but you might you you would have

958
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:25,358
noticed that there were more more fruit

959
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:27,280
obviously on these and so many of our

960
00:45:25,358 --> 00:45:29,598
Growers are going to less and less

961
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:31,240
pruning because we're understanding this

962
00:45:29,599 --> 00:45:35,359
more and

963
00:45:31,239 --> 00:45:39,239
more so I want to go back to the thing

964
00:45:35,358 --> 00:45:39,239
here I can get out of

965
00:45:39,358 --> 00:45:44,759
this and back to this but I'm have to

966
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:47,239
going to have to go all the way back oh

967
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:47,240
no here we

968
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:54,838
are uh so yeah right

969
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:57,000
there so I I want to acknowledge our

970
00:45:54,838 --> 00:45:57,960
collaborators on this project it's it's

971
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:02,400
been

972
00:45:57,960 --> 00:46:05,000
basically uh 25 years of work um off and

973
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:08,079
on so in terms of the development of the

974
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:10,400
root stock initial the initial two Dave

975
00:46:08,079 --> 00:46:12,839
raming was the USDA researcher the

976
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:14,599
material came from him Scott Johnson

977
00:46:12,838 --> 00:46:17,558
Kevin Day and Jim Doyle we did all of

978
00:46:14,599 --> 00:46:19,720
the field analysis and then control

979
00:46:17,559 --> 00:46:23,200
controller 678 and

980
00:46:19,719 --> 00:46:25,519
9.5 uh Fred Bliss was a faculty member

981
00:46:23,199 --> 00:46:28,078
but Ali aletti was a technician of his

982
00:46:25,519 --> 00:46:29,800
that did almost most of the work and

983
00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:32,280
these guys also have been helping this

984
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:34,720
is a graduate student and then all of

985
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:37,160
the physiology initially done by WBO and

986
00:46:34,719 --> 00:46:40,719
we had Boris bili from Italy Jordy

987
00:46:37,159 --> 00:46:42,799
Marcel from Spain Luis Solari from he

988
00:46:40,719 --> 00:46:48,279
was a student from

989
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:51,039
Uruguay and two two from uh Italy and

990
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:53,200
one from Brazil and then the modeling

991
00:46:51,039 --> 00:46:56,000
stuff which I really just showed you a

992
00:46:53,199 --> 00:46:58,239
little bit about and that's been sort of

993
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:02,400
the main occupation of my mental

994
00:46:58,239 --> 00:47:05,558
whatever mental stuff I have left uh we

995
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:08,079
David D Silva in the last four years has

996
00:47:05,559 --> 00:47:09,760
been really instrumental in that as well

997
00:47:08,079 --> 00:47:12,039
as Romeo Romeo

998
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:14,240
favro uh is a really interesting guy

999
00:47:12,039 --> 00:47:17,599
he's about 86 now and he was working in

1000
00:47:14,239 --> 00:47:20,039
our lab until a year and a half ago on a

1001
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:21,200
voluntary basis for about six years

1002
00:47:20,039 --> 00:47:25,960
eight

1003
00:47:21,199 --> 00:47:28,759
years um he was a computer scientist

1004
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:30,960
that was at the input at the very

1005
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:34,280
beginning of introduction of computers

1006
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:37,440
into the world into into Commerce he

1007
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:41,319
installed the the first main computer

1008
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:43,079
main frame computer in in Europe back in

1009
00:47:41,318 --> 00:47:45,679
the 50s

1010
00:47:43,079 --> 00:47:47,240
60s and then these two guys also worked

1011
00:47:45,679 --> 00:47:49,960
on the model quite a

1012
00:47:47,239 --> 00:47:53,479
bit so I think that's

1013
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:53,480
it thanks for your

1014
00:47:54,719 --> 00:47:57,719
attention

1015
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:08,838
yeah uh I have two questions the first

1016
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:12,240
one is uh when did you exactly girle

1017
00:48:08,838 --> 00:48:14,480
those trees uh you mention that is a

1018
00:48:12,239 --> 00:48:16,719
month I mean two weeks a month before

1019
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:19,039
Harvest or but no no that no in that

1020
00:48:16,719 --> 00:48:21,118
case we did it April we did it the first

1021
00:48:19,039 --> 00:48:23,639
one was April early April and the second

1022
00:48:21,119 --> 00:48:26,400
one I think was late April or early may

1023
00:48:23,639 --> 00:48:29,920
I think early yeah I think late April

1024
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:33,039
it said it on the thing but I it was I

1025
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:35,480
just want to make sure so you measure

1026
00:48:33,039 --> 00:48:39,558
the uh midday stand keep in mind that

1027
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:44,519
our our our our Bloom and our our spring

1028
00:48:39,559 --> 00:48:47,079
is is around March 10 for for uh these

1029
00:48:44,519 --> 00:48:50,920
speach varities yeah with all that in

1030
00:48:47,079 --> 00:48:53,519
mind but do you think the new dylm

1031
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:55,440
development provides a significant you

1032
00:48:53,519 --> 00:48:57,358
know provide significant amount of water

1033
00:48:55,440 --> 00:49:01,039
to to those plants let say 2 weeks after

1034
00:48:57,358 --> 00:49:03,679
the Garing that's my question apparently

1035
00:49:01,039 --> 00:49:06,960
okay now we know that the dylm the

1036
00:49:03,679 --> 00:49:09,239
initial movement of sugars up the tree

1037
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:11,119
is all in the zyl the fl's nonfunctional

1038
00:49:09,239 --> 00:49:12,879
so the initial movement of sugar up the

1039
00:49:11,119 --> 00:49:14,599
tree in the spring is in the xylm so

1040
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:16,519
there's got to be some functional xylm

1041
00:49:14,599 --> 00:49:18,559
there's no question about that but

1042
00:49:16,519 --> 00:49:23,000
apparently that that new xylm that's

1043
00:49:18,559 --> 00:49:26,160
being developed is more efficient or

1044
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:28,760
is that's our only interpretation

1045
00:49:26,159 --> 00:49:30,759
and the interesting thing is we look at

1046
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:32,200
we look at that water relations thing

1047
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:34,839
that we see the difference in water

1048
00:49:32,199 --> 00:49:38,239
relations it holds up until about the

1049
00:49:34,838 --> 00:49:40,719
end of end of June if you measure the

1050
00:49:38,239 --> 00:49:42,679
difference in water relations between

1051
00:49:40,719 --> 00:49:46,039
trees on war root stocks and and

1052
00:49:42,679 --> 00:49:47,798
vigorous roof stocks in July and August

1053
00:49:46,039 --> 00:49:49,759
there's there's no significant

1054
00:49:47,798 --> 00:49:52,639
difference in the in the stem water

1055
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:55,559
detention usually very difficult to

1056
00:49:52,639 --> 00:49:56,358
detect one and my interpretation now is

1057
00:49:55,559 --> 00:49:59,920
is

1058
00:49:56,358 --> 00:50:02,960
that um is that the new ring of xylm is

1059
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:05,519
being formed and that's act and because

1060
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:08,039
it's that the vessels in that ring are

1061
00:50:05,519 --> 00:50:10,039
smaller that that is

1062
00:50:08,039 --> 00:50:12,558
actually

1063
00:50:10,039 --> 00:50:14,798
hindering the the H hydraulic

1064
00:50:12,559 --> 00:50:18,160
conductance of that new Sho

1065
00:50:14,798 --> 00:50:20,559
gr and and and the growth of that tree

1066
00:50:18,159 --> 00:50:23,719
for that for that early part of the

1067
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:30,599
season when the when you get adequate

1068
00:50:23,719 --> 00:50:33,358
new rings of of of U xylm then you have

1069
00:50:30,599 --> 00:50:37,119
enough vessels even though they're

1070
00:50:33,358 --> 00:50:39,558
smaller to to match the capacity of the

1071
00:50:37,119 --> 00:50:41,880
of the requirement of the top that's

1072
00:50:39,559 --> 00:50:43,519
that's our interpretation at the present

1073
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:47,519
time

1074
00:50:43,519 --> 00:50:49,759
and do you has that been verified

1075
00:50:47,519 --> 00:50:52,000
anatomically we haven't we haven't done

1076
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:54,119
that we haven't done that no we we

1077
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:57,440
should do that additional thing looking

1078
00:50:54,119 --> 00:51:00,880
at the actually of the the and calculate

1079
00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:03,838
the total hydraulic capacity of of that

1080
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:06,599
of the to ring what we did so far was

1081
00:51:03,838 --> 00:51:09,558
just look at the new ring all all that

1082
00:51:06,599 --> 00:51:11,519
xylm stuff was related to the new ring

1083
00:51:09,559 --> 00:51:15,440
but only one section of the new ring I

1084
00:51:11,519 --> 00:51:15,440
mean only a microscopic

1085
00:51:15,559 --> 00:51:22,960
field my second question is since the uh

1086
00:51:19,239 --> 00:51:25,879
D mechanism in pit uh is primarily

1087
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:29,079
limitation of water transport do think

1088
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:31,798
uh with the same root stocks will we see

1089
00:51:29,079 --> 00:51:34,240
less DF effect in New York versus

1090
00:51:31,798 --> 00:51:37,039
California how about it's a fact on

1091
00:51:34,239 --> 00:51:39,759
fruit size cuz water is so important for

1092
00:51:37,039 --> 00:51:41,759
fruit size uh well that's I think why we

1093
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:45,079
get the the the problem with with

1094
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:48,040
controller five it has it has small

1095
00:51:45,079 --> 00:51:51,480
fruit uh controller five was in the

1096
00:51:48,039 --> 00:51:55,400
early earlier nc-140

1097
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:57,400
trial the national root stock trial uh

1098
00:51:55,400 --> 00:52:02,280
the people in New York really liked it

1099
00:51:57,400 --> 00:52:03,318
because for some reason it has higher uh

1100
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:05,599
cold

1101
00:52:03,318 --> 00:52:07,599
tolerance that may be related to this

1102
00:52:05,599 --> 00:52:10,240
vessel size too I don't know yeah it's

1103
00:52:07,599 --> 00:52:13,400
much safer uh but but the root stop but

1104
00:52:10,239 --> 00:52:15,479
but the fruit in California is too small

1105
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:17,599
to be an acceptable root stock for

1106
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:20,599
commercial production in California now

1107
00:52:17,599 --> 00:52:23,440
controller six there the next step up

1108
00:52:20,599 --> 00:52:25,760
and it's a her blood by Oka one would

1109
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:29,599
think that it would have root a fruit

1110
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:31,799
size problem but for some reason and I'm

1111
00:52:29,599 --> 00:52:35,519
not sure we don't understand

1112
00:52:31,798 --> 00:52:36,599
why uh Harvest is delayed a week with

1113
00:52:35,519 --> 00:52:39,280
controller

1114
00:52:36,599 --> 00:52:42,039
six so we think that while it may have

1115
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:44,880
an inherently smaller fruit size if it's

1116
00:52:42,039 --> 00:52:49,159
hard at the same time because you add a

1117
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:51,280
weat to it it's able to make

1118
00:52:49,159 --> 00:52:54,399
up a bit of the

1119
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:56,400
difference and so it has acceptable

1120
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:58,318
fruit size

1121
00:52:56,400 --> 00:53:01,039
so we're quite excited I think actually

1122
00:52:58,318 --> 00:53:03,039
that's the other two are then getting

1123
00:53:01,039 --> 00:53:06,000
close enough to neag guard that is very

1124
00:53:03,039 --> 00:53:09,519
difficult to see a difference in fruit

1125
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:11,039
size so yeah the observation has been

1126
00:53:09,519 --> 00:53:14,559
made with apple that if you grab an

1127
00:53:11,039 --> 00:53:16,960
inner stem into a three-part tree and

1128
00:53:14,559 --> 00:53:18,880
it's dwarfing inner stem the degree of

1129
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:21,119
dwarfing be proportional to the length

1130
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:25,680
of that right same in here same with

1131
00:53:21,119 --> 00:53:28,960
this I think the same so so apples and

1132
00:53:25,679 --> 00:53:33,480
n it's a more complicated

1133
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:35,838
story but laxo was one of the other

1134
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:41,079
people have reported it also but laxo

1135
00:53:35,838 --> 00:53:44,440
and um his student here uh early

1136
00:53:41,079 --> 00:53:49,280
student anyway they reported that Ming n

1137
00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:52,240
had a had uh a a lower water potential

1138
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:54,040
trees on Sans on Ming n had a lower

1139
00:53:52,239 --> 00:53:55,879
water potential than than trees on

1140
00:53:54,039 --> 00:53:58,318
seedling or

1141
00:53:55,880 --> 00:54:01,160
big that was that was published years

1142
00:53:58,318 --> 00:54:03,358
ago already uh but they sort of left it

1143
00:54:01,159 --> 00:54:05,960
there I think sort of in the same

1144
00:54:03,358 --> 00:54:07,598
conundrum that big bank was in and we

1145
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:10,400
were all in that but the muling N is

1146
00:54:07,599 --> 00:54:13,280
also different in that that you have

1147
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:15,160
this overgrowth and there's signs of

1148
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:16,960
some sort of fling compatibility or

1149
00:54:15,159 --> 00:54:20,558
something going on in there as

1150
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:23,280
well uh so I think that I think that is

1151
00:54:20,559 --> 00:54:27,400
a more complicated root stock

1152
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:31,000
situation but I think is involved but

1153
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:33,519
it's certainly not the whole story yeah

1154
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:35,480
um you hear now and again that

1155
00:54:33,519 --> 00:54:39,039
California might be having a drought

1156
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:41,679
issue on the news and so I was just

1157
00:54:39,039 --> 00:54:44,159
curious given that you're conducting

1158
00:54:41,679 --> 00:54:47,118
hydraulic studies if you maybe had any

1159
00:54:44,159 --> 00:54:49,598
special challenges in your research or

1160
00:54:47,119 --> 00:54:52,440
something that you had you know that you

1161
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:56,240
have to kind of make amends for I just

1162
00:54:52,440 --> 00:54:59,838
was kind of curious about that well

1163
00:54:56,239 --> 00:55:02,199
uh yeah we all have to make special

1164
00:54:59,838 --> 00:55:05,880
things this particular year because

1165
00:55:02,199 --> 00:55:08,719
water is on everyone's mind and

1166
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:13,318
salinity what's what's happening now is

1167
00:55:08,719 --> 00:55:15,719
that the so California has a very

1168
00:55:13,318 --> 00:55:17,358
complicated water distribution system

1169
00:55:15,719 --> 00:55:20,558
all of the tradition many of the

1170
00:55:17,358 --> 00:55:22,639
traditional water districts on east side

1171
00:55:20,559 --> 00:55:25,200
of the S Valley and the center of the

1172
00:55:22,639 --> 00:55:27,199
valley they they all have these grav

1173
00:55:25,199 --> 00:55:30,159
grafing fed irrigation

1174
00:55:27,199 --> 00:55:32,759
districts uh and and many of those will

1175
00:55:30,159 --> 00:55:35,318
be probably getting something like 40 to

1176
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:38,559
60% of the normal

1177
00:55:35,318 --> 00:55:40,880
allocation the ones the ones that are on

1178
00:55:38,559 --> 00:55:42,640
the uh and those are all local

1179
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:44,200
Irrigation District more or less local

1180
00:55:42,639 --> 00:55:46,038
irrigation districts the ones that are

1181
00:55:44,199 --> 00:55:48,679
on the federal irrigation or state

1182
00:55:46,039 --> 00:55:51,760
irrigation projects like the California

1183
00:55:48,679 --> 00:55:53,759
aquaduct basically the the water on the

1184
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:58,039
west side of the San Valley and the

1185
00:55:53,760 --> 00:56:00,880
water and that water flow into La all of

1186
00:55:58,039 --> 00:56:02,319
that's all of that's in in the

1187
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:05,240
California Water

1188
00:56:02,318 --> 00:56:08,199
Project and what happens with that water

1189
00:56:05,239 --> 00:56:09,038
is it's basically water that's pumped

1190
00:56:08,199 --> 00:56:13,558
out

1191
00:56:09,039 --> 00:56:17,839
of uh out of the Delta before the Delta

1192
00:56:13,559 --> 00:56:20,440
runs into the the San Francisco Bay so

1193
00:56:17,838 --> 00:56:22,920
the water is fresh up it's pumped out of

1194
00:56:20,440 --> 00:56:26,559
that up the hill and then and then

1195
00:56:22,920 --> 00:56:28,720
reverse gra down the valley

1196
00:56:26,559 --> 00:56:30,880
and then pumped a couple more times

1197
00:56:28,719 --> 00:56:32,078
every time it gets too low pumped up

1198
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:38,039
high or again

1199
00:56:32,079 --> 00:56:41,680
low but that water that water is is

1200
00:56:38,039 --> 00:56:44,799
um there well most of the Growers on

1201
00:56:41,679 --> 00:56:47,358
that side are going to get zero of their

1202
00:56:44,798 --> 00:56:50,920
allocation some of them

1203
00:56:47,358 --> 00:56:53,440
20% so those people are are the ones

1204
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:56,480
that are going to be really hurting and

1205
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:59,760
and much of that land this year the

1206
00:56:56,480 --> 00:57:03,480
Growers um some Growers of permanent

1207
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:07,160
free crop also have uh have anual crops

1208
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:09,559
Tomatoes melons whatever usually cotton

1209
00:57:07,159 --> 00:57:11,639
most of those grow if they if they're

1210
00:57:09,559 --> 00:57:14,039
growing two types of crop on different

1211
00:57:11,639 --> 00:57:16,838
pieces of land most of them will will

1212
00:57:14,039 --> 00:57:18,520
not plant their annual their annual crop

1213
00:57:16,838 --> 00:57:21,599
and they'll use whatever water they can

1214
00:57:18,519 --> 00:57:24,960
find to keep their perennial crop

1215
00:57:21,599 --> 00:57:27,200
alive uh and and they'll do that largely

1216
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:29,639
by pumping the groundwater but the

1217
00:57:27,199 --> 00:57:31,960
problem in that area is the groundwater

1218
00:57:29,639 --> 00:57:34,598
depending on where you are it can be

1219
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:38,720
very saline or quite

1220
00:57:34,599 --> 00:57:41,440
s so right now at the moment everybody

1221
00:57:38,719 --> 00:57:45,199
is flipping coins and drawing straws as

1222
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:46,880
to as to whether the lack of water is

1223
00:57:45,199 --> 00:57:49,439
going to be the worst thing or whether

1224
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:52,720
the sa the salinity of the water is

1225
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:55,480
going to be the worst thing but but for

1226
00:57:52,719 --> 00:57:57,838
sure it's all going to be worse there

1227
00:57:55,480 --> 00:58:00,000
there's no doubt about that and then up

1228
00:57:57,838 --> 00:58:02,199
north in the s in the Sacramento Valley

1229
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:03,838
there's also similar sort of water

1230
00:58:02,199 --> 00:58:04,798
distribution comes out of the Sacramento

1231
00:58:03,838 --> 00:58:08,639
River

1232
00:58:04,798 --> 00:58:10,358
Hub uh the rice Growers uh there's a lot

1233
00:58:08,639 --> 00:58:12,480
of rice in California believe it or not

1234
00:58:10,358 --> 00:58:14,838
and the drought State we have we grow a

1235
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:17,000
lot of rice in the in the nor in the in

1236
00:58:14,838 --> 00:58:19,480
the Sacramento Valley there will be a

1237
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:21,760
lot some of that won't be planted or

1238
00:58:19,480 --> 00:58:23,719
people may plant cuz those people will

1239
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:26,119
probably get 40 to 50% of their

1240
00:58:23,719 --> 00:58:28,000
allocation and so a lot of that they

1241
00:58:26,119 --> 00:58:31,160
will plant half their land and use the

1242
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:34,039
water from the whole allocation to to do

1243
00:58:31,159 --> 00:58:35,598
the half of the land something like that

1244
00:58:34,039 --> 00:58:39,960
because the price of rice at the moment

1245
00:58:35,599 --> 00:58:42,280
is really good so there's previously we

1246
00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:44,920
had when we had a drought a lot of the

1247
00:58:42,280 --> 00:58:47,359
price of rice was really low so those

1248
00:58:44,920 --> 00:58:48,639
guys up there sold their water to the

1249
00:58:47,358 --> 00:58:50,759
people down

1250
00:58:48,639 --> 00:58:52,960
south because we have all these water

1251
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:55,880
conveyance systems you can do that

1252
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:57,400
there's a water Market in California

1253
00:58:55,880 --> 00:58:59,000
uh but this year that probably won't

1254
00:58:57,400 --> 00:59:02,240
happen much

1255
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:07,400
because um agriculture in California

1256
00:59:02,239 --> 00:59:11,719
barring the drought is is the

1257
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:14,318
most uh lucrative I've ever seen it in

1258
00:59:11,719 --> 00:59:17,838
my in my 30 years

1259
00:59:14,318 --> 00:59:21,000
it's 35 years of being at the University

1260
00:59:17,838 --> 00:59:23,199
all many crops are in high demand with

1261
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,199
high

1262
00:59:23,239 --> 00:59:30,759
prices and R walnuts and pistachios are

1263
00:59:27,318 --> 00:59:35,838
are are really the market is

1264
00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:35,839
unbelievable yes Alan had a question

1265
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:42,798
Alan um yeah I just I wanted to point

1266
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:46,119
out we got similar results as you

1267
00:59:42,798 --> 00:59:48,679
mentioned with with apple um what we

1268
00:59:46,119 --> 00:59:51,480
found was that at the top of the root

1269
00:59:48,679 --> 00:59:54,719
stock the dwarfing stock had a lower

1270
00:59:51,480 --> 00:59:57,199
water potential more stress but then as

1271
00:59:54,719 --> 00:59:59,598
you went out the branches there was a

1272
00:59:57,199 --> 01:00:02,519
decrease in water potential due to the

1273
00:59:59,599 --> 01:00:05,000
friction but that was the the slope of

1274
01:00:02,519 --> 01:00:07,400
that was the same regardless in the

1275
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:10,880
Canan but what happened is when you got

1276
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:12,318
out to the uh end of the branch you had

1277
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:15,400
the same water

1278
01:00:12,318 --> 01:00:17,880
potentials but on the dwarfing stock you

1279
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:22,079
got to the water potential with a 1 Meer

1280
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:23,960
Long Branch and with the U more vigorous

1281
01:00:22,079 --> 01:00:26,119
one you started with a higher water

1282
01:00:23,960 --> 01:00:28,559
potential so so it took 2 m of growth to

1283
01:00:26,119 --> 01:00:31,720
get to that same water potential where

1284
01:00:28,559 --> 01:00:33,680
it stopped so the the outside of the

1285
01:00:31,719 --> 01:00:36,239
trees all ended up with the same water

1286
01:00:33,679 --> 01:00:38,639
potential but it varied with the root

1287
01:00:36,239 --> 01:00:41,439
stock at the big at the U center of the

1288
01:00:38,639 --> 01:00:43,400
tree really we never we haven't looked

1289
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:44,559
at that down the shoot at all was that

1290
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:48,599
with you and

1291
01:00:44,559 --> 01:00:51,119
Bill yeah Bill Bill yeah

1292
01:00:48,599 --> 01:00:53,318
okay I had remembered that part of the

1293
01:00:51,119 --> 01:00:56,519
St study I don't know that did you

1294
01:00:53,318 --> 01:00:56,519
publish that part of the study

1295
01:00:56,639 --> 01:01:02,239
um that was 30 years ago I think

1296
01:00:59,599 --> 01:01:04,359
so I'll look for it if I did that's okay

1297
01:01:02,239 --> 01:01:06,919
I usually just skim the papers for I

1298
01:01:04,358 --> 01:01:06,920
wanted to hear

1299
01:01:07,639 --> 01:01:12,318
anyway do you have any other questions

1300
01:01:14,039 --> 01:01:20,880
thought nothing else all right I'll see

1301
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:20,880
you tonight Helen

1302
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:26,440
okay

1303
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:39,480
this has been a production of Cornell
