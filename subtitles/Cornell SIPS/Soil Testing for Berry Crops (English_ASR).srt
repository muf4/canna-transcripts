in the soil management for Barry crops

72
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:21,530
webinar and today the topic will be

73
00:03:19,219 --> 00:03:24,500
specifically on sampling procedures in

74
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:25,759
soil test options I would like to give

75
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:27,739
you just a little bit more background

76
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:29,840
though about dairy one in the

77
00:03:27,739 --> 00:03:33,079
relationship that we have with Cornell

78
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:34,879
and agri one some of you probably know

79
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:37,670
who we are and just in case you don't

80
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:38,870
were many of you might know us as the

81
00:03:37,669 --> 00:03:41,358
former dairy herd improvement

82
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:43,969
association we do milk testing and

83
00:03:41,359 --> 00:03:46,310
record services for dairy dairy farmers

84
00:03:43,969 --> 00:03:47,930
throughout the Northeast we also provide

85
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:50,989
herd management software and

86
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:52,730
installation services I work in the part

87
00:03:50,989 --> 00:03:54,409
of the business that deals with forage

88
00:03:52,729 --> 00:03:57,919
analysis were probably one of the

89
00:03:54,409 --> 00:04:00,109
biggest forged labs in the US we we

90
00:03:57,919 --> 00:04:03,109
cover all 50 states and 37 foreign

91
00:04:00,109 --> 00:04:07,430
countries as well and several years ago

92
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:09,799
we got into the realm of soil testing on

93
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:12,650
more recently plant tissue analysis we

94
00:04:09,799 --> 00:04:16,069
also do water and manure analysis for

95
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:17,590
customers as well ergo one you might

96
00:04:16,069 --> 00:04:19,909
wonder you know with all this dairy

97
00:04:17,589 --> 00:04:23,329
influence how does their grow one fit

98
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:25,970
into their well in 2009 many of you are

99
00:04:23,329 --> 00:04:29,750
aware that the Cornell nutrient analysis

100
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:31,910
laboratory basically discontinued their

101
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:35,600
commercial soil testing they joined

102
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:38,419
strength with with dairy one to provide

103
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:40,550
soil and plant tissue analysis services

104
00:04:38,418 --> 00:04:43,519
to New York homeowners farmers and farm

105
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:46,310
advisors in this new venture called agro

106
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:49,000
one and the Cornell nutrient analysis

107
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:51,829
lab continues to conduct research

108
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:55,459
samples they also provide the the heavy

109
00:04:51,829 --> 00:04:58,788
metal testing they still assemble and

110
00:04:55,459 --> 00:05:01,219
sell the the pH test kits they conduct

111
00:04:58,788 --> 00:05:04,189
particle size analysis and a number of

112
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:06,110
other tests as well there at the at the

113
00:05:04,189 --> 00:05:10,009
lab in Ithaca they're also responsible

114
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:11,538
for the nutrient recommendations and as

115
00:05:10,009 --> 00:05:13,819
part of the the air grow one agreement

116
00:05:11,538 --> 00:05:16,459
we do the chemical analysis but Cornell

117
00:05:13,819 --> 00:05:19,279
still generates the recommendations the

118
00:05:16,459 --> 00:05:21,799
new lab director my krudsky X as the

119
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:25,609
primary liaison between Cornell and

120
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:27,560
dairy one and Steve reiners is the

121
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:30,288
primary liaison for the recommendations

122
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:32,269
so we have a very close working

123
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:35,389
relationship with the folks at Cornell

124
00:05:32,269 --> 00:05:37,819
for those of you who are joining us from

125
00:05:35,389 --> 00:05:39,408
New York and you need a little bit more

126
00:05:37,819 --> 00:05:42,408
clarification about who's responsible

127
00:05:39,408 --> 00:05:44,598
for what has already mentioned dearie

128
00:05:42,408 --> 00:05:46,788
one or a grow one which I will probably

129
00:05:44,598 --> 00:05:48,620
use a little bit interchangeably we're

130
00:05:46,788 --> 00:05:50,560
responsible for the routine chemical

131
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:53,449
analysis of soils and plant tissue

132
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:55,430
samples we're responsible for billing

133
00:05:53,449 --> 00:05:57,949
and accounts with customers the report

134
00:05:55,430 --> 00:06:01,129
formats the delivery vehicles whether

135
00:05:57,949 --> 00:06:04,000
it's email or fax or searchable database

136
00:06:01,129 --> 00:06:06,110
for example we're also responsible for

137
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,478
you know if somebody's looking for a

138
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:11,180
report or they have some unexpected

139
00:06:08,478 --> 00:06:13,668
results and they have some questions the

140
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:17,090
county offices are very important

141
00:06:13,668 --> 00:06:19,889
because they're sort of the first level

142
00:06:17,089 --> 00:06:21,628
of contact for that customer

143
00:06:19,889 --> 00:06:23,038
in New York State if they need some

144
00:06:21,629 --> 00:06:25,680
assistance interpreting the

145
00:06:23,038 --> 00:06:27,360
recommendations as always that's that's

146
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:31,918
how it's always been and will continue

147
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:34,379
to be there also the go-to part of

148
00:06:31,918 --> 00:06:37,498
Cornell if a customer has general crop

149
00:06:34,379 --> 00:06:40,110
management questions or needs assistance

150
00:06:37,499 --> 00:06:42,740
for example with identifying soil series

151
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:46,278
names that you need for recommendations

152
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:49,800
cnl or the cornell lab they're

153
00:06:46,278 --> 00:06:52,468
responsible for overall soil testing and

154
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:54,329
plant tissue testing procedures general

155
00:06:52,468 --> 00:06:56,968
questions or comments about the nutrient

156
00:06:54,329 --> 00:07:00,329
guidelines any of the specialized tests

157
00:06:56,968 --> 00:07:02,430
like heavy metals and also for providing

158
00:07:00,329 --> 00:07:04,740
access to the commodity experts if the

159
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:08,370
county offices need additional

160
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:10,259
assistance we also a tegra one work very

161
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:12,389
closely with the Cornell soil health lab

162
00:07:10,259 --> 00:07:13,800
and some of you from outside of New York

163
00:07:12,389 --> 00:07:15,990
State are probably familiar with Bob

164
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:18,538
Jean de Becque and the soil health lab

165
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:20,728
they're looking at taking a more

166
00:07:18,538 --> 00:07:23,370
holistic approach to soil health and

167
00:07:20,728 --> 00:07:27,088
looking at chemical physical and

168
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:29,939
biological health of the soil and as you

169
00:07:27,088 --> 00:07:32,699
probably know we're doing the chemical

170
00:07:29,939 --> 00:07:36,050
analysis but Cornell will be doing the

171
00:07:32,699 --> 00:07:40,110
physical and biological evaluations and

172
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:42,389
this list on this page shows many of the

173
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:46,468
components that Cornell is looking at in

174
00:07:42,389 --> 00:07:49,379
physical and biological health and again

175
00:07:46,468 --> 00:07:51,959
agri one is responsible for the the

176
00:07:49,379 --> 00:07:55,889
chemical analysis is part of that

177
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:57,810
program I'm guessing that most of you if

178
00:07:55,889 --> 00:07:59,460
you're working with Barry crops here in

179
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:01,319
the Northeast are in the US you

180
00:07:59,459 --> 00:08:04,168
certainly understand the importance of

181
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:06,870
soil testing so i apologize if a lot of

182
00:08:04,168 --> 00:08:08,639
this is a repeat but for those of you

183
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:11,459
who maybe aren't as familiar with soil

184
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:13,319
testing i just want to review as they

185
00:08:11,459 --> 00:08:15,930
asked me to to review some of the

186
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:18,870
important parts of soil sampling and

187
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:20,218
soil testing and i think we all know

188
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:22,468
that it's a very important crop

189
00:08:20,218 --> 00:08:24,569
management tool you really have to have

190
00:08:22,468 --> 00:08:27,930
that tool to know how much lime and

191
00:08:24,569 --> 00:08:30,449
fertilizer to apply to get optimum crop

192
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:33,690
yield and quality and to avoid costly

193
00:08:30,449 --> 00:08:35,220
over/under fertilization of that crop

194
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:38,940
and it's also important from an

195
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:40,560
environmental perspective as well and in

196
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:43,680
in some of our crop commodities

197
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:46,679
especially in the dairy end of things a

198
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:48,839
regular soil testing program is a

199
00:08:46,679 --> 00:08:51,569
requirement of many of the nutrient

200
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:53,430
management planning efforts and in most

201
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:55,410
states now when it comes to soil

202
00:08:53,429 --> 00:08:56,849
sampling and analysis I'm going to be

203
00:08:55,409 --> 00:08:59,399
covering a number of different topics

204
00:08:56,850 --> 00:09:02,940
including establishing a sampling

205
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:05,340
schedule using the right tools including

206
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:07,140
the probes appeals the containers and

207
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:09,600
forms you wouldn't think that would be

208
00:09:07,139 --> 00:09:12,120
all that important but I'll you might

209
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,529
learn a couple of things that about even

210
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:16,440
the sample containers that you didn't

211
00:09:13,529 --> 00:09:18,569
know before sampling technique I'll

212
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:21,510
cover where weird a sample how many

213
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:23,640
subsamples sample depth preparing the

214
00:09:21,509 --> 00:09:26,100
sample for shipment and then we'll do a

215
00:09:23,639 --> 00:09:28,350
very brief discussion of soil test

216
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:30,710
options whether it's for routine or

217
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:33,180
diagnostic purposes and some of the

218
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:35,009
different analytical options because

219
00:09:33,179 --> 00:09:38,250
there are a lot of different soil test

220
00:09:35,009 --> 00:09:39,509
procedures out there in addition to the

221
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:41,159
ones that are listed here there's

222
00:09:39,509 --> 00:09:43,250
actually a few others and then this as

223
00:09:41,159 --> 00:09:46,519
well and I'll touch briefly on

224
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:49,769
interpretation and follow-up as well

225
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:51,509
probably the most important part of this

226
00:09:49,769 --> 00:09:53,610
whole puzzle when it comes to soil

227
00:09:51,509 --> 00:09:57,090
testing and soil fertility for any crop

228
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:59,879
is getting the soil pH to the right

229
00:09:57,090 --> 00:10:02,190
level for optimum crop performance and

230
00:09:59,879 --> 00:10:05,189
with most fruits and vegetables most

231
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:08,040
most crops in general that optimum range

232
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:09,990
is in the PH range of six to seven but

233
00:10:08,039 --> 00:10:13,319
in it with berries in particular

234
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:15,930
blueberries have some different

235
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:19,710
requirements blueberries in particular

236
00:10:15,929 --> 00:10:23,399
if you look at the general requirements

237
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:25,379
for berries most berries I think pretty

238
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:27,480
simple you could just say if it's a good

239
00:10:25,379 --> 00:10:30,299
alfalfa soil it's going to be good for

240
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:32,789
strawberries or raspberries many of the

241
00:10:30,299 --> 00:10:36,269
berry crops they need a well-drained

242
00:10:32,789 --> 00:10:39,569
sandy loam soil ideally with a pH and

243
00:10:36,269 --> 00:10:42,929
that's 62 to 68 range organic matter

244
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:45,270
somewhere above three percent and but

245
00:10:42,929 --> 00:10:47,278
for blueberries as I've already alluded

246
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:49,889
to

247
00:10:47,278 --> 00:10:53,399
crop that operates best at a pH between

248
00:10:49,889 --> 00:10:57,299
4.2 and 4.8 which is much more acidic

249
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:59,909
than other berry crops also tends to do

250
00:10:57,299 --> 00:11:02,698
well at slightly higher organic matters

251
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:05,879
and can perform very well even with low

252
00:11:02,698 --> 00:11:08,008
phosphorus availability so that that

253
00:11:05,879 --> 00:11:12,499
certainly is a important distinction to

254
00:11:08,009 --> 00:11:14,850
make and it can be very crop specific

255
00:11:12,499 --> 00:11:19,379
like with anything else whether we're

256
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:21,870
talking manure or forage or soil or milk

257
00:11:19,379 --> 00:11:24,300
sampling technique is probably the most

258
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:27,120
important part of the whole process if

259
00:11:24,299 --> 00:11:29,370
you get a crummy sample you're going to

260
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:32,058
get crummy results so it's very very

261
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:35,999
important to take time to do it right

262
00:11:32,058 --> 00:11:37,379
and spend your money effectively because

263
00:11:35,999 --> 00:11:39,689
that's going to determine the accuracy

264
00:11:37,379 --> 00:11:43,129
and repeatability of that sample it's

265
00:11:39,688 --> 00:11:46,349
good for a perennial crop like berries

266
00:11:43,129 --> 00:11:48,539
you need to get that that done properly

267
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:50,249
upfront before you get the crop planted

268
00:11:48,539 --> 00:11:53,278
because they it will be your last shot

269
00:11:50,249 --> 00:11:56,339
for a number of years to make any major

270
00:11:53,278 --> 00:12:00,088
adjustments in pH or soil nutrient

271
00:11:56,339 --> 00:12:02,550
levels and again it it will help you

272
00:12:00,089 --> 00:12:04,410
ultimately avoid very costly over or

273
00:12:02,549 --> 00:12:08,128
under fertilization so these are all

274
00:12:04,409 --> 00:12:10,110
very important considerations first we

275
00:12:08,129 --> 00:12:12,000
want to establish a sampling schedule

276
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:15,209
and obviously the best time to do this

277
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,899
is sample before if the crop goes in the

278
00:12:15,208 --> 00:12:20,518
ground although it always amazes me

279
00:12:17,899 --> 00:12:22,948
whether it's seed or fertilizer whatever

280
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:24,568
how many panic questions you get after

281
00:12:22,948 --> 00:12:27,058
somebody hit they put something in the

282
00:12:24,568 --> 00:12:28,740
ground they don't have very good results

283
00:12:27,058 --> 00:12:31,500
and then they call wondering what they

284
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:33,509
can do because they didn't check the

285
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:37,549
soil pH they didn't check the fertility

286
00:12:33,509 --> 00:12:40,110
on and on so get that sample for berries

287
00:12:37,549 --> 00:12:42,990
especially with blueberries at least a

288
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:45,209
year ahead of planting and in the case

289
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:47,579
of other berries probably six to twelve

290
00:12:45,208 --> 00:12:49,979
months is a good idea as well because

291
00:12:47,578 --> 00:12:52,198
you have to allow enough time for added

292
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:54,480
lime or sulfur to react with the soil to

293
00:12:52,198 --> 00:12:56,578
give that pH down to the desired range

294
00:12:54,480 --> 00:13:00,539
within the whole rooting zone of the

295
00:12:56,578 --> 00:13:01,229
plant and then after that typically

296
00:13:00,539 --> 00:13:04,409
recommend

297
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:07,019
and with with perennial crops to be

298
00:13:04,409 --> 00:13:09,600
sampling every two to three years or as

299
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:12,449
needed for troubleshooting typically

300
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:14,550
though with with any kind of fruit we

301
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:16,800
couple the soil sampling with plant

302
00:13:14,549 --> 00:13:18,359
tissue analysis because we need to know

303
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:20,039
what's what's in the soil and what's

304
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:23,250
actually getting into the plant and

305
00:13:20,039 --> 00:13:25,500
that's a very useful diagnostic and when

306
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:27,539
it comes to determining fertilizer needs

307
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:29,100
for the the crop and it can also be

308
00:13:27,539 --> 00:13:31,019
helpful if you're using a cover crop

309
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:32,550
between rows to make sure that you're

310
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:38,399
meeting the needs of that crop as well

311
00:13:32,549 --> 00:13:40,139
and as far as time of the year I guess I

312
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:42,360
would just say that spring or fall is

313
00:13:40,139 --> 00:13:44,789
probably the most logical time of year

314
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:46,560
to sample once you pick a time stick

315
00:13:44,789 --> 00:13:49,129
with it so that you're sampling at the

316
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:51,629
same time in the future as well

317
00:13:49,129 --> 00:13:54,299
generally considered that fall is the

318
00:13:51,629 --> 00:13:56,730
most reliable time of year primarily for

319
00:13:54,299 --> 00:13:59,250
soil pH determination because the soil

320
00:13:56,730 --> 00:14:01,529
is a little bit moister and changes in

321
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:06,090
the summer because the soil moisture

322
00:14:01,529 --> 00:14:08,189
drying out can result in a temporary

323
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:10,379
decrease in soil pH so sampling in the

324
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:13,860
summer time typically is it can be a

325
00:14:10,379 --> 00:14:16,830
little bit misleading so just make sure

326
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:18,539
that you get that sample in enough time

327
00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:20,730
so that you can make the proper

328
00:14:18,539 --> 00:14:23,009
adjustments needed to get that pH

329
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:27,110
increased or decreased as as the soil

330
00:14:23,009 --> 00:14:30,149
test requires Janet we have a question

331
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:33,180
okay sure Janet sorry we have a question

332
00:14:30,149 --> 00:14:36,179
from Laura she just received a question

333
00:14:33,179 --> 00:14:40,919
about buffered or unbuffered cce tests

334
00:14:36,179 --> 00:14:42,299
CEC tests for pre plant cell test for

335
00:14:40,919 --> 00:14:45,269
blueberries can you help her make a

336
00:14:42,299 --> 00:14:47,809
recommendation the cation exchange

337
00:14:45,269 --> 00:14:50,850
capacity is that what she's asking about

338
00:14:47,809 --> 00:14:54,089
yes should they indicate they want the

339
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:58,950
buffered or the unbuffered test for pre

340
00:14:54,090 --> 00:15:01,379
plant blueberries um i guess i would

341
00:14:58,950 --> 00:15:04,740
have to defer that question to marvin

342
00:15:01,379 --> 00:15:08,220
because i'm not a fruit specialist per

343
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:11,460
se and we don't do any we don't provide

344
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:15,120
cation exchange capacity as part of the

345
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:17,370
cornell packages of the the dairy one

346
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:20,399
the mail like three packages you you can

347
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:22,560
get a cation exchange capacity all of

348
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:24,899
the the CEC testing currently for the

349
00:15:22,559 --> 00:15:26,789
Cornell packages would be done at CL

350
00:15:24,899 --> 00:15:30,720
because it is a different procedure than

351
00:15:26,789 --> 00:15:32,879
the procedure used with malik three so i

352
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,139
guess i'll make note of that and if you

353
00:15:32,879 --> 00:15:35,460
can keep track of who we asked the

354
00:15:34,139 --> 00:15:38,669
question we can make sure we can get

355
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:41,550
back to her with with an answer thank

356
00:15:38,669 --> 00:15:46,349
you okay sorry I couldn't help you with

357
00:15:41,549 --> 00:15:49,588
that now back to some of the tools of

358
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:51,480
the trade certainly there are a lot of

359
00:15:49,589 --> 00:15:53,040
different tools out there for sampling

360
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:54,990
soils and I wish I could say that

361
00:15:53,039 --> 00:15:57,750
there's one tool it's better than

362
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:59,850
another but sometimes the answer to that

363
00:15:57,750 --> 00:16:01,589
is well it depends on the soil

364
00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:03,839
conditions and the soil types and you

365
00:16:01,589 --> 00:16:06,089
might need if you're doing a lot of soil

366
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:09,029
sampling you might want to have several

367
00:16:06,089 --> 00:16:12,560
of these in your arsenal of tools and I

368
00:16:09,028 --> 00:16:15,149
will review them real real quickly here

369
00:16:12,559 --> 00:16:17,789
typically we would suggest that you use

370
00:16:15,149 --> 00:16:20,009
a stainless steel probe or a stainless

371
00:16:17,789 --> 00:16:21,750
steel auger for best results if you're

372
00:16:20,009 --> 00:16:24,480
using something that's going to get

373
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:27,240
rusty then that rust can be that iron

374
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:29,550
contamination can be an issue with some

375
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:32,459
of those homemade probes especially in

376
00:16:29,549 --> 00:16:34,439
high pH areas and we typically don't see

377
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:36,750
many of those issues here in New York

378
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:38,910
but in some of the western states i know

379
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:40,769
iron chlorosis is a problem on crops

380
00:16:38,909 --> 00:16:43,829
like soybeans and other crops as well

381
00:16:40,769 --> 00:16:47,039
and iron contamination could give you a

382
00:16:43,830 --> 00:16:48,810
false high reading of iron when you

383
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:50,669
actually could be deficient so that's

384
00:16:48,809 --> 00:16:53,399
why using a stainless steel probe is a

385
00:16:50,669 --> 00:16:55,949
better idea and likewise if you're

386
00:16:53,399 --> 00:16:58,919
mixing samples and a bucket out in the

387
00:16:55,950 --> 00:17:02,879
field or or in the garage for example

388
00:16:58,919 --> 00:17:05,279
don't use a galvanized pale on because

389
00:17:02,879 --> 00:17:07,410
that can contaminate the sample with

390
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:11,849
zinc so it's it's best to use a clean

391
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:13,860
plastic bucket and I've already

392
00:17:11,849 --> 00:17:15,869
mentioned that there are probes and

393
00:17:13,859 --> 00:17:18,240
there's augers well what's the

394
00:17:15,869 --> 00:17:20,399
difference well I think most of you are

395
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:23,789
probably familiar with using the slit

396
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:26,339
cited augers anybody who's doing a lot

397
00:17:23,789 --> 00:17:28,629
of soil sampling would probably agree

398
00:17:26,338 --> 00:17:31,659
that using one that also has a foot

399
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:33,460
peg on it is a lot easier on your back

400
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:37,300
if you're only doing an occasional

401
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:40,630
sample here there then the it foot peg

402
00:17:37,299 --> 00:17:42,549
isn't as critical but certainly is it

403
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:44,560
will save your back a lot of aggravation

404
00:17:42,549 --> 00:17:46,779
if you're doing a lot of sampling and

405
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:49,720
it's also going to be faster in good

406
00:17:46,779 --> 00:17:53,619
conditions and it but it works the best

407
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:56,950
in a dry soil with few rocks and where I

408
00:17:53,619 --> 00:17:59,829
live we have a lot of rocks and that can

409
00:17:56,950 --> 00:18:02,289
plug it up and also in very wet soils

410
00:17:59,829 --> 00:18:04,029
that type of a probe will just push the

411
00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:06,579
sample down and it doesn't go up into

412
00:18:04,029 --> 00:18:10,389
the tube so there can be a consideration

413
00:18:06,579 --> 00:18:13,960
so an auger is probably a better choice

414
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:17,380
on rocky soils or on eroded Knowles if

415
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:19,509
you have a lot of like Shelly rocks flat

416
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:23,800
rocks they tend to be very troublesome

417
00:18:19,509 --> 00:18:25,779
or wet soils and you even with wet soils

418
00:18:23,799 --> 00:18:28,659
you'll have some of the soils sticking

419
00:18:25,779 --> 00:18:31,119
to the flights on the on the auger but

420
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:32,710
it'll still work you can also use a

421
00:18:31,119 --> 00:18:36,219
power drill if you're doing a lot of

422
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:38,500
samples and you can put a plastic

423
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:41,230
container like a food container with a

424
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:43,480
hole in the middle around the auger so

425
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:45,789
that the soil will fall back into that

426
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:50,470
container is it pulls the soil out of

427
00:18:45,789 --> 00:18:53,559
the ground it'll help considerably you

428
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:55,630
can use shovels or spades for occasional

429
00:18:53,559 --> 00:18:57,759
use or in the home garden but you need

430
00:18:55,630 --> 00:18:59,710
to trim it so you're just getting like a

431
00:18:57,759 --> 00:19:01,930
one-inch core down the middle otherwise

432
00:18:59,710 --> 00:19:03,370
the wedge-shaped samples isn't going to

433
00:19:01,930 --> 00:19:05,230
be representative you're going to get

434
00:19:03,369 --> 00:19:07,539
you know maybe too much of the upper

435
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:10,390
surfaces represented and it's a lot

436
00:19:07,539 --> 00:19:14,200
slower and more difficult to get a good

437
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:16,120
sample and just not practical in most

438
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:18,970
cases if you're doing a lot of sampling

439
00:19:16,119 --> 00:19:21,009
and I think that we're starting to see a

440
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:24,490
lot more of the automatic samplers used

441
00:19:21,009 --> 00:19:26,349
by some of the crop advisors and they're

442
00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:28,240
gaining in popularity in areas where

443
00:19:26,349 --> 00:19:29,649
they're using precision agriculture and

444
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:34,450
maybe they're using variable rate

445
00:19:29,650 --> 00:19:37,630
application the hand probes are probably

446
00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:39,759
still best for shallow samples but I

447
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:40,990
think that these automatic samplers can

448
00:19:39,759 --> 00:19:42,940
be very

449
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:45,279
in untilled sites and also for deep

450
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:47,799
sampling there they can be very good as

451
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:49,660
well I'll probably see more of those out

452
00:19:47,799 --> 00:19:50,919
in the field and something I learned

453
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:54,880
when I was putting this presentation

454
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:57,009
together I've used Pam or silicone

455
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:58,720
sprays on our Forge probe on the outside

456
00:19:57,009 --> 00:20:02,039
of the probe to make it easier to get

457
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:06,490
that probe in and out of a ballet or a

458
00:20:02,039 --> 00:20:09,159
bunk silo but you can also use them in

459
00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:13,120
soil test probes on the inside on the

460
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:16,420
outside of the probe so that you can

461
00:20:13,119 --> 00:20:17,889
prevent plugging and the only situation

462
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:21,308
where you wouldn't want to use something

463
00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:25,450
like Pam or wd-40 or a silicone spray is

464
00:20:21,308 --> 00:20:28,119
if you are doing a diagnostic sample for

465
00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:30,940
a suspected micronutrient deficiency but

466
00:20:28,119 --> 00:20:34,719
for your run-of-the-mill normal routine

467
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:38,019
soil test research shows that it's okay

468
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:40,630
to use these these types of products to

469
00:20:38,019 --> 00:20:43,119
help prevent sticking there are a lot of

470
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:45,250
different places where you can order a

471
00:20:43,119 --> 00:20:49,058
soil test probe you can even get one on

472
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:51,190
ebay or amazon com but I think most

473
00:20:49,058 --> 00:20:55,000
people are familiar if you're doing any

474
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:58,390
any serious soil testing soil sampling

475
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:01,900
oakfield apparatus is one that they have

476
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:05,440
a very comprehensive assortment of soil

477
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:08,920
samplers gamblers Granger's you know

478
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:12,100
they typically handle of Oakfield and

479
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:14,380
other soil samplers been Meadows is

480
00:21:12,099 --> 00:21:16,419
another supplier and you can spend

481
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:18,700
anywhere from fifty dollars up to a

482
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:21,820
thousand dollars for a standard soil

483
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:23,410
test probe or a kit so really a lot of

484
00:21:21,819 --> 00:21:26,558
it depends on your personal preference

485
00:21:23,410 --> 00:21:28,800
and how much you're going to be using it

486
00:21:26,558 --> 00:21:31,569
for your job so it's hard for me to say

487
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:33,220
which which unit will be best for you

488
00:21:31,569 --> 00:21:35,710
but there's a lot there's a lot to

489
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:37,750
choose from and if you're not sure I

490
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:39,640
guess I would start on the low end and

491
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:41,740
work your way up if you if you decide

492
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:46,150
you need something with more bells and

493
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:50,558
whistles now when we get down to actual

494
00:21:46,150 --> 00:21:52,360
sampling strategies I think it just

495
00:21:50,558 --> 00:21:54,319
common sense would tell you that the

496
00:21:52,359 --> 00:21:57,319
more sub-samples you take

497
00:21:54,319 --> 00:21:59,808
the better and typically we recommend

498
00:21:57,319 --> 00:22:03,019
taking samples in a somewhat random

499
00:21:59,808 --> 00:22:07,220
zigzag pattern in each management area

500
00:22:03,019 --> 00:22:08,899
if you're you're bury the area that

501
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:11,720
you're planning is less than two acres

502
00:22:08,898 --> 00:22:14,298
probably eight to ten subsamples in that

503
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:17,120
two acre area would be sufficient but if

504
00:22:14,298 --> 00:22:19,658
you're larger than two acres I would

505
00:22:17,119 --> 00:22:22,129
suggest ten to twenty subsamples and

506
00:22:19,659 --> 00:22:27,259
more sub-samples is always going to be

507
00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:30,649
better and with some crops usually in

508
00:22:27,259 --> 00:22:32,240
larger fields some consultants are doing

509
00:22:30,648 --> 00:22:33,949
grid sampling for this precision

510
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:35,929
agriculture and using those automatic

511
00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:38,629
samplers but it can be very expensive

512
00:22:35,929 --> 00:22:40,870
when it's done properly ideally you'd

513
00:22:38,628 --> 00:22:43,519
get one sample per acre realistically

514
00:22:40,869 --> 00:22:45,739
there I think most people are doing

515
00:22:43,519 --> 00:22:49,970
maybe one sample for every four to five

516
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:53,200
acres and then also you might be doing a

517
00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:55,730
directed sampling based on the

518
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:57,470
topography of the field and this picture

519
00:22:55,730 --> 00:23:01,579
you can see in a row despite up on the

520
00:22:57,470 --> 00:23:04,339
top left of the the figure or a low spot

521
00:23:01,579 --> 00:23:06,558
down on the bottom right you might want

522
00:23:04,339 --> 00:23:08,839
to take separate samples from you know

523
00:23:06,558 --> 00:23:11,119
the main area compared to an eroded spot

524
00:23:08,839 --> 00:23:12,949
or a low spot or if you're

525
00:23:11,119 --> 00:23:15,558
troubleshooting you'll be taking a

526
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:17,870
targeted sample from the bed area and a

527
00:23:15,558 --> 00:23:20,000
targeted sample from a good area just to

528
00:23:17,869 --> 00:23:24,798
help you further pin down where the

529
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:27,669
problem might be and along those lines

530
00:23:24,798 --> 00:23:30,888
with directed sampling you want to avoid

531
00:23:27,669 --> 00:23:34,669
unusual areas avoid the dead furrows

532
00:23:30,888 --> 00:23:40,219
farm lanes old hedgerows old manure

533
00:23:34,669 --> 00:23:41,919
piles wet areas severely eroded areas

534
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:45,319
unless you're going to sample them

535
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:48,559
separately and as I mentioned before

536
00:23:45,319 --> 00:23:51,408
take separate samples from areas that

537
00:23:48,558 --> 00:23:55,009
vary greatly and either the slope or

538
00:23:51,409 --> 00:23:57,830
texture or crop history and of course

539
00:23:55,009 --> 00:23:59,120
just like with forage sampling you you

540
00:23:57,829 --> 00:24:01,548
want to sample each lot of hay

541
00:23:59,119 --> 00:24:03,319
differently you want to sample each

542
00:24:01,548 --> 00:24:04,819
management area separately if you're

543
00:24:03,319 --> 00:24:07,878
going to be fertilizing it differently

544
00:24:04,819 --> 00:24:09,618
where there's a different crop

545
00:24:07,878 --> 00:24:11,658
or if you have a suspected nutrient

546
00:24:09,618 --> 00:24:15,499
imbalance in that area sample it

547
00:24:11,659 --> 00:24:18,409
separately from the rest and I've

548
00:24:15,499 --> 00:24:20,358
already alluded to this routine versus

549
00:24:18,409 --> 00:24:23,449
diagnostic sampling it's a little bit

550
00:24:20,358 --> 00:24:25,338
different with routine soil analysis

551
00:24:23,449 --> 00:24:26,959
you're going to be looking at lime and

552
00:24:25,338 --> 00:24:29,719
fertilizer recommendations for

553
00:24:26,959 --> 00:24:31,759
establishment or maintenance this is

554
00:24:29,719 --> 00:24:33,739
what you would be doing you know if you

555
00:24:31,759 --> 00:24:37,068
don't have any specific problems or

556
00:24:33,739 --> 00:24:39,739
suspected imbalances just routine for

557
00:24:37,068 --> 00:24:42,828
diagnostic analysis you might want to

558
00:24:39,739 --> 00:24:45,469
also add soluble salts to the standard

559
00:24:42,828 --> 00:24:47,690
package with some crops if they have a

560
00:24:45,469 --> 00:24:50,359
high boron requirement you might also

561
00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:54,109
want to add the hot water soluble boron

562
00:24:50,358 --> 00:24:57,318
is an example to the standard package

563
00:24:54,108 --> 00:24:59,898
and as I also mentioned previously use

564
00:24:57,318 --> 00:25:03,499
paired samples from good and bad areas

565
00:24:59,898 --> 00:25:06,768
and with berries also if you're doing

566
00:25:03,499 --> 00:25:09,649
some troubleshooting use a plant tissue

567
00:25:06,769 --> 00:25:11,989
analysis in conjunction with soil

568
00:25:09,648 --> 00:25:13,908
testing to further assist with any

569
00:25:11,989 --> 00:25:16,818
troubleshooting efforts that you might

570
00:25:13,909 --> 00:25:18,289
have just because something's in the

571
00:25:16,818 --> 00:25:21,019
ground doesn't mean it's getting into

572
00:25:18,288 --> 00:25:23,148
the plant and and then also is where the

573
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:24,618
soil health evaluations can be very

574
00:25:23,148 --> 00:25:28,848
helpful because that's looking at

575
00:25:24,618 --> 00:25:31,058
compaction and also biological issues

576
00:25:28,848 --> 00:25:33,168
and and many other physical

577
00:25:31,058 --> 00:25:34,788
characteristics of a soil that might

578
00:25:33,169 --> 00:25:36,769
impact the ability of the plant a

579
00:25:34,788 --> 00:25:40,908
actually take up the nutrients even if

580
00:25:36,769 --> 00:25:46,128
they are they're sampling to the proper

581
00:25:40,909 --> 00:25:48,829
depth certainly very important Marvin

582
00:25:46,128 --> 00:25:52,308
pritts said that you know with most

583
00:25:48,828 --> 00:25:54,528
berry crops surface 28 inch depth is

584
00:25:52,308 --> 00:25:56,989
adequate because the rooting depth of

585
00:25:54,528 --> 00:26:00,679
most berries would be in that area that

586
00:25:56,989 --> 00:26:02,808
0 to 8 inches get that ahead of planning

587
00:26:00,679 --> 00:26:06,859
so you can plow down and incorporate

588
00:26:02,808 --> 00:26:09,798
needed lime sulfur or nutrients and same

589
00:26:06,858 --> 00:26:11,928
thing for established stands sample down

590
00:26:09,798 --> 00:26:14,749
to that eight inch depth but use it

591
00:26:11,929 --> 00:26:18,319
along with this plant tissue analysis

592
00:26:14,749 --> 00:26:21,029
now Marvin did mention that if you had a

593
00:26:18,318 --> 00:26:23,399
suspected problem and

594
00:26:21,029 --> 00:26:27,000
and you needed to get a deeper sample

595
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:28,769
you just need to specify on the sample

596
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,869
information sheet that let's say you're

597
00:26:28,769 --> 00:26:33,559
sampling it at eight to sixteen inch

598
00:26:30,869 --> 00:26:36,299
depth because it certainly would be

599
00:26:33,559 --> 00:26:39,109
useful in interpreting that information

600
00:26:36,299 --> 00:26:41,279
and using it to modify your

601
00:26:39,109 --> 00:26:46,799
recommendations but that that's not a

602
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:48,240
routine requirement for for berries then

603
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:50,970
when you're out in the field taking

604
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:54,210
those samples you want to discard that

605
00:26:50,970 --> 00:26:56,130
if you do have any grassy met of you

606
00:26:54,210 --> 00:27:00,600
know decaying plant material on top of

607
00:26:56,130 --> 00:27:03,390
the the core discard that scarred the

608
00:27:00,599 --> 00:27:05,490
soil below eight inches put it in the

609
00:27:03,390 --> 00:27:09,870
bucket makes it completely in a clean

610
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:11,789
plastic bucket or bag and i will say

611
00:27:09,869 --> 00:27:14,279
that we get an awful lot of samples in

612
00:27:11,789 --> 00:27:16,859
it egra one that are taken when the

613
00:27:14,279 --> 00:27:19,319
soils are really too wet to be sampled

614
00:27:16,859 --> 00:27:23,969
that makes it very difficult to mix

615
00:27:19,319 --> 00:27:25,889
those subsamples up uniformly so you

616
00:27:23,970 --> 00:27:28,890
probably are going to have to air dry

617
00:27:25,890 --> 00:27:31,200
those samples if you want to get them

618
00:27:28,890 --> 00:27:34,259
mixed well and get a good composite

619
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:36,539
sample and so really if you can't avoid

620
00:27:34,259 --> 00:27:38,730
sampling under extremely wet soil

621
00:27:36,539 --> 00:27:41,759
conditions it's probably a good idea for

622
00:27:38,730 --> 00:27:44,880
a number of reasons they also get our

623
00:27:41,759 --> 00:27:46,680
leaky you can have some changes in some

624
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:50,570
nutrients primarily when you're talking

625
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:53,190
the liked psn tea samples the nitrogen

626
00:27:50,569 --> 00:27:55,859
can change very quickly especially in

627
00:27:53,190 --> 00:27:58,259
what samples but it really is not

628
00:27:55,859 --> 00:28:02,369
conducive to getting a good mix of all

629
00:27:58,259 --> 00:28:07,369
those sub-samples when you have your

630
00:28:02,369 --> 00:28:09,989
sample all air dried and and mixed up

631
00:28:07,369 --> 00:28:12,869
another very important part of the

632
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:15,509
process is to complete the sample

633
00:28:12,869 --> 00:28:18,029
information sheet fill in all of the

634
00:28:15,509 --> 00:28:20,129
required information whether it's a soil

635
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:22,440
name the soil drainage class depending

636
00:28:20,130 --> 00:28:25,580
on what state you're from and what they

637
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:28,170
require but also the billing information

638
00:28:25,579 --> 00:28:30,419
who gets copies whether you want it

639
00:28:28,170 --> 00:28:33,390
faxed or emailed make sure you get all

640
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:34,740
that information filled in and keep a

641
00:28:33,390 --> 00:28:37,980
copy for your own record

642
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:40,859
to that that's can be invaluable if you

643
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:43,259
are looking for reports later if for

644
00:28:40,859 --> 00:28:45,539
whatever reason you lost your copy or

645
00:28:43,259 --> 00:28:47,609
you didn't get it whatever it just makes

646
00:28:45,539 --> 00:28:50,190
tracking it down that much easier and

647
00:28:47,609 --> 00:28:53,879
when all is said and done we only need

648
00:28:50,190 --> 00:28:57,029
about three quarters to one point of a

649
00:28:53,880 --> 00:29:00,960
mixed sample whether it's in a box or

650
00:28:57,029 --> 00:29:02,910
bag so it's roughly two cups of sample

651
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:04,440
or less that that's all that we need

652
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:06,540
we're actually only going to analyze

653
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:09,150
about two grams of that sample when all

654
00:29:06,539 --> 00:29:13,230
is said and done Janet we have a

655
00:29:09,150 --> 00:29:14,700
sampling question yes Jeff would like to

656
00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:16,319
know what you would suggest as a

657
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:20,100
sampling procedure when growers are

658
00:29:16,319 --> 00:29:22,980
using drip tape for fertigation a drip

659
00:29:20,099 --> 00:29:25,319
tape for fertigation well obviously

660
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:28,759
you're you're you don't want to be

661
00:29:25,319 --> 00:29:33,210
sampling through the drip tape but I

662
00:29:28,759 --> 00:29:38,160
guess you need to get between the rows

663
00:29:33,210 --> 00:29:41,789
and just stay in the exact pattern if at

664
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:48,600
all possible and get as close to you

665
00:29:41,789 --> 00:29:50,190
know Rose centers as possible I haven't

666
00:29:48,599 --> 00:29:52,529
worked with with drip tape so I guess

667
00:29:50,190 --> 00:29:54,240
Jeff if you have any suggestions on that

668
00:29:52,529 --> 00:29:56,789
I'd appreciate I've never sampled in

669
00:29:54,240 --> 00:30:00,150
that kind of a situation but you still

670
00:29:56,789 --> 00:30:03,569
need to get the area where the roots are

671
00:30:00,150 --> 00:30:06,000
going to be able to reach so how far

672
00:30:03,569 --> 00:30:09,500
part of those those drip tapes I guess I

673
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,500
should i ask that right up front

674
00:30:10,690 --> 00:30:16,210
yeah they do you have an answer to that

675
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:18,009
it would vary from crop to crop there

676
00:30:16,210 --> 00:30:20,890
might only be one it typically would run

677
00:30:18,009 --> 00:30:22,839
down the center the center well then I

678
00:30:20,890 --> 00:30:25,600
would just say that you know obviously

679
00:30:22,839 --> 00:30:27,639
avoid those areas because you don't want

680
00:30:25,599 --> 00:30:29,500
to damage the tape and also nutrients

681
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:31,990
might be a little bit more concentrated

682
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:34,690
there and not representative of what the

683
00:30:31,990 --> 00:30:37,650
whole rooting zone would be it'd be sort

684
00:30:34,690 --> 00:30:41,230
of like sampling under the drip line of

685
00:30:37,650 --> 00:30:43,810
trees for example you just want you want

686
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:45,549
to get in try and get samples in the

687
00:30:43,809 --> 00:30:49,200
area where the crop is actually going to

688
00:30:45,549 --> 00:30:53,589
be drawing its nutrients from that's

689
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:55,930
it's about all I can suggest on that one

690
00:30:53,589 --> 00:30:58,379
I'll make a note on that as well and see

691
00:30:55,930 --> 00:31:02,740
if Marvin has any suggestions on

692
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:06,550
sampling where there's drip tape okay

693
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:08,109
what I'm going to move on here because

694
00:31:06,549 --> 00:31:11,230
we still have a fair amount to cover

695
00:31:08,109 --> 00:31:12,969
here when you're getting the samples

696
00:31:11,230 --> 00:31:14,769
ready you know that you've got it all

697
00:31:12,970 --> 00:31:17,259
mixed up you're ready to put it in the

698
00:31:14,769 --> 00:31:21,009
sample bag or box box one thing that a

699
00:31:17,259 --> 00:31:23,950
lot of people aren't aware of and is

700
00:31:21,009 --> 00:31:28,150
that you really should if possible use a

701
00:31:23,950 --> 00:31:30,580
bag or box provided by the lab and avoid

702
00:31:28,150 --> 00:31:32,410
commercial paper paper bags or paper

703
00:31:30,579 --> 00:31:35,939
boxes and the reason for that is that

704
00:31:32,410 --> 00:31:39,970
the glue and many paper bags and also

705
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:42,910
just the processing of cardboard there

706
00:31:39,970 --> 00:31:44,529
may actually be some boron used in the

707
00:31:42,910 --> 00:31:46,480
glue and in the treatment of that

708
00:31:44,529 --> 00:31:48,700
cardboard and it kind of altered the

709
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:51,610
results especially if the sample is wet

710
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:54,910
so if you're if you're growing a boron

711
00:31:51,609 --> 00:31:56,619
sensitive crop you could get an

712
00:31:54,910 --> 00:32:00,250
artificially high reading if you're

713
00:31:56,619 --> 00:32:01,929
using a commercial bag or box so that's

714
00:32:00,250 --> 00:32:04,059
something that a lot of us in the soil

715
00:32:01,930 --> 00:32:07,509
testing industry learned the hard way

716
00:32:04,059 --> 00:32:10,299
many years ago but a lot of customers

717
00:32:07,509 --> 00:32:14,019
still are not aware of that fact so keep

718
00:32:10,299 --> 00:32:16,059
that in mind as well I've already

719
00:32:14,019 --> 00:32:20,079
mentioned how important the paperwork is

720
00:32:16,059 --> 00:32:22,629
and there is a pointer here this is an

721
00:32:20,079 --> 00:32:24,519
example of the fruit form for the air

722
00:32:22,630 --> 00:32:27,549
grow one samples we have a

723
00:32:24,519 --> 00:32:30,700
an F form for fruits V form for

724
00:32:27,548 --> 00:32:34,719
vegetables a is field crops H is the

725
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:38,048
home garden and t is for turf on all of

726
00:32:34,719 --> 00:32:40,330
these except for homeowner there there

727
00:32:38,048 --> 00:32:41,618
is I'm trying to get an arrow here if

728
00:32:40,329 --> 00:32:45,579
you look at the middle where it says

729
00:32:41,618 --> 00:32:48,118
soil information or soil name if you

730
00:32:45,579 --> 00:32:51,458
want to get recommendations in New York

731
00:32:48,118 --> 00:32:54,878
you have their ears that arrow how do I

732
00:32:51,459 --> 00:32:58,749
move it well it I'm sorry let me back up

733
00:32:54,878 --> 00:33:01,058
here getting ahead of myself under soil

734
00:32:58,749 --> 00:33:04,358
name it's required with with everything

735
00:33:01,058 --> 00:33:06,969
except for the home sample sheet you

736
00:33:04,358 --> 00:33:10,628
must provide a valid soil name or you

737
00:33:06,969 --> 00:33:12,190
will not get recommendations and most

738
00:33:10,628 --> 00:33:13,988
people who have been farming for any

739
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:15,969
length of time they know they have the

740
00:33:13,989 --> 00:33:19,119
maps of their fields they know the soil

741
00:33:15,969 --> 00:33:23,200
names are in Vermont you we need to have

742
00:33:19,118 --> 00:33:25,808
a soil drainage class and for the

743
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:28,838
homeowner samples you need to provide

744
00:33:25,808 --> 00:33:30,608
some information on drexel texture and

745
00:33:28,838 --> 00:33:33,519
soil drainage in order to get those

746
00:33:30,608 --> 00:33:36,308
recommendations you also need to fill in

747
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:39,519
the uh non the various crops of cropping

748
00:33:36,308 --> 00:33:41,709
history and what your future crops will

749
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:44,259
be in the on the vegetable forms and on

750
00:33:41,709 --> 00:33:46,479
the the field crop forms and you can get

751
00:33:44,259 --> 00:33:48,308
multiple year recommendations so it's

752
00:33:46,479 --> 00:33:51,009
very important to read this carefully

753
00:33:48,308 --> 00:33:53,319
and provide all of the required

754
00:33:51,009 --> 00:33:55,509
information if you want to get the

755
00:33:53,319 --> 00:33:59,138
report back the way you expect it to be

756
00:33:55,509 --> 00:34:01,269
so to fill it in legibly and if you

757
00:33:59,138 --> 00:34:03,128
don't know where to find your soil

758
00:34:01,269 --> 00:34:04,538
series name and this is useful

759
00:34:03,128 --> 00:34:06,428
information whether you're in other

760
00:34:04,538 --> 00:34:10,389
states that don't require a soil name

761
00:34:06,429 --> 00:34:12,460
for recommendations but there is a web

762
00:34:10,389 --> 00:34:17,079
soil survey the link is provided on our

763
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:22,960
forms this it item number two web soil

764
00:34:17,079 --> 00:34:25,028
survey is an NRCS website and you can go

765
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:28,119
there it's pretty user-friendly if I can

766
00:34:25,028 --> 00:34:30,039
figure it out you can and you just type

767
00:34:28,119 --> 00:34:34,119
in an address and zoom in on a specific

768
00:34:30,039 --> 00:34:36,099
field and create a box and tell it to

769
00:34:34,119 --> 00:34:38,019
map it and it will literally map all the

770
00:34:36,099 --> 00:34:40,899
different soil types in it

771
00:34:38,019 --> 00:34:43,300
civic field or area and provide you with

772
00:34:40,898 --> 00:34:47,139
some information on the characteristics

773
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:50,800
of those soils there is also an app for

774
00:34:47,139 --> 00:34:56,168
iPhones I see I have that here twice for

775
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:59,170
iPhones Androids it's from California

776
00:34:56,168 --> 00:35:02,139
actually from UC Davis but it is an NRCS

777
00:34:59,170 --> 00:35:04,990
based app that you can put on your

778
00:35:02,139 --> 00:35:06,190
smartphone and it's georeference so if

779
00:35:04,989 --> 00:35:09,250
you're standing out in the field

780
00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:11,170
somewhere you just click on that app and

781
00:35:09,250 --> 00:35:12,909
it'll get you the soil name and the

782
00:35:11,170 --> 00:35:14,740
characteristics for the spot where

783
00:35:12,909 --> 00:35:18,039
you're standing so it's that's another

784
00:35:14,739 --> 00:35:20,799
very useful tool that's available for

785
00:35:18,039 --> 00:35:24,610
free it's a free app so i would suggest

786
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:27,310
you try that out and as i mentioned that

787
00:35:24,610 --> 00:35:29,680
web soil survey if you do use that this

788
00:35:27,309 --> 00:35:32,650
map is a little bit hard to see but it

789
00:35:29,679 --> 00:35:34,750
will it'll come up with a map with faint

790
00:35:32,650 --> 00:35:37,740
yellow lines and then you've got the

791
00:35:34,750 --> 00:35:42,969
codes of the the various soil types

792
00:35:37,739 --> 00:35:45,009
within each soil unit area and then that

793
00:35:42,969 --> 00:35:47,769
they'll give you a legend for the map

794
00:35:45,010 --> 00:35:50,260
and there's additional information on

795
00:35:47,769 --> 00:35:52,090
that web soil survey site as well as far

796
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:55,240
as the characteristics of that

797
00:35:52,090 --> 00:35:57,160
particular soil as you can see there's

798
00:35:55,239 --> 00:35:59,709
the you know a lot of fields have more

799
00:35:57,159 --> 00:36:01,679
than one soil type the nice thing here

800
00:35:59,710 --> 00:36:05,980
is that this will give you the acres of

801
00:36:01,679 --> 00:36:08,919
each soil type within the the area that

802
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:11,530
you had the map so just list the one

803
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:14,530
that's the primary soil type in that

804
00:36:11,530 --> 00:36:16,570
field and if it's a palmyra gravelly

805
00:36:14,530 --> 00:36:18,670
silt loam for example all we need is

806
00:36:16,570 --> 00:36:20,789
palmyra we don't need the descriptors at

807
00:36:18,670 --> 00:36:23,639
the end just the soil series name is

808
00:36:20,789 --> 00:36:25,960
sufficient to get those recommendations

809
00:36:23,639 --> 00:36:27,699
and then when it comes time for shipping

810
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:29,530
and handling check with the lab that

811
00:36:27,699 --> 00:36:32,319
you're working with the see what the

812
00:36:29,530 --> 00:36:34,600
options are if you're working with us we

813
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:36,370
already have a built-in system of pickup

814
00:36:34,599 --> 00:36:38,079
points for our milk samples wherever

815
00:36:36,369 --> 00:36:41,170
there's cows there's going to be pickup

816
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:43,809
points and on our website you can go to

817
00:36:41,170 --> 00:36:46,420
this map and click on the the location

818
00:36:43,809 --> 00:36:49,599
nearest to you and find out the address

819
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:51,639
and the days and the time that samples

820
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:53,769
are picked up generally it's three

821
00:36:51,639 --> 00:36:55,569
three times a week and there's no charge

822
00:36:53,769 --> 00:36:58,539
for that so you can ship the samples

823
00:36:55,570 --> 00:37:02,500
free of charge otherwise you can ship

824
00:36:58,539 --> 00:37:05,860
them by US mail FedEx UPS whatever is

825
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:07,659
going to be best and for things like PS

826
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:10,539
NT that are a little bit more time

827
00:37:07,659 --> 00:37:12,309
sensitive I'd suggest mailing early in

828
00:37:10,539 --> 00:37:14,199
the week so that they don't sit in a

829
00:37:12,309 --> 00:37:16,389
post office somewhere for a couple of

830
00:37:14,199 --> 00:37:20,939
days losing time and getting warm and

831
00:37:16,389 --> 00:37:24,339
changing in their their analysis so

832
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:26,590
that's basically it in terms of sampling

833
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:29,860
and shipping and handling just some

834
00:37:26,590 --> 00:37:31,840
general general guidelines which would

835
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:33,640
fit whether you're working with a grow

836
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:37,240
one or you're working with a university

837
00:37:33,639 --> 00:37:39,789
lab or another commercial lab and so

838
00:37:37,239 --> 00:37:41,619
field sampling is field sampling but

839
00:37:39,789 --> 00:37:45,309
when we get down to extraction and

840
00:37:41,619 --> 00:37:47,079
chemical analysis there are quite a few

841
00:37:45,309 --> 00:37:50,170
differences between labs and it's

842
00:37:47,079 --> 00:37:54,819
important to understand the differences

843
00:37:50,170 --> 00:37:57,430
because it there are some challenges

844
00:37:54,820 --> 00:38:01,539
there's it's often tempting to compare

845
00:37:57,429 --> 00:38:03,009
the results from one lab to another but

846
00:38:01,539 --> 00:38:05,050
that's not always a good idea because

847
00:38:03,010 --> 00:38:07,180
chances are very good they're using

848
00:38:05,050 --> 00:38:08,590
different extraction techniques and the

849
00:38:07,179 --> 00:38:11,289
numbers aren't going to be comparable

850
00:38:08,590 --> 00:38:14,350
maybe the relative ranges are but the

851
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:16,539
extraction results the numbers can be

852
00:38:14,349 --> 00:38:19,539
very different and it just makes it

853
00:38:16,539 --> 00:38:24,369
rather difficult and specifically how do

854
00:38:19,539 --> 00:38:26,500
these labs differ well depending on

855
00:38:24,369 --> 00:38:29,139
where you from you might be using a

856
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:32,260
different extractant solutions such as

857
00:38:29,139 --> 00:38:36,039
Olson or Bray or their their more

858
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:40,410
Midwest or western US procedures or a

859
00:38:36,039 --> 00:38:44,469
maelich 3 or Morgan or modified Morgan

860
00:38:40,409 --> 00:38:46,659
maelich 3 is used by Penn State and some

861
00:38:44,469 --> 00:38:50,889
of the southern states and some of the

862
00:38:46,659 --> 00:38:53,190
Midwest commercial labs as well Morgan

863
00:38:50,889 --> 00:38:57,369
historically has been used by Cornell

864
00:38:53,190 --> 00:39:01,360
modified Morgan is used by both agro one

865
00:38:57,369 --> 00:39:03,400
it used to be used it Vermont it's

866
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:04,528
currently the the procedure used it you

867
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:07,509
may

868
00:39:04,528 --> 00:39:09,838
each one of these measures a different

869
00:39:07,509 --> 00:39:12,880
amount of phosphorous and potassium and

870
00:39:09,838 --> 00:39:16,838
for a specific lab or a specific state

871
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:18,548
the recommendations are based on rate

872
00:39:16,838 --> 00:39:21,489
response studies that have been

873
00:39:18,548 --> 00:39:24,338
calibrated against the P and K soil test

874
00:39:21,489 --> 00:39:27,190
for that that state or that lab and the

875
00:39:24,338 --> 00:39:32,230
sufficiency values are specific to the

876
00:39:27,190 --> 00:39:34,028
extractant that's used relative levels

877
00:39:32,230 --> 00:39:35,559
like I said you might be a little bit

878
00:39:34,028 --> 00:39:38,849
better off there but as far as the

879
00:39:35,559 --> 00:39:42,220
actual absolute values of ppm of

880
00:39:38,849 --> 00:39:45,249
phosphorous or potassium or pounds per

881
00:39:42,219 --> 00:39:48,639
acre of phosphorous and potassium be

882
00:39:45,248 --> 00:39:52,568
very specific to the extractant used as

883
00:39:48,639 --> 00:39:55,480
i mentioned bray one that's one oil test

884
00:39:52,568 --> 00:39:58,298
that was developed for use in the in the

885
00:39:55,480 --> 00:40:02,829
north central us on acid to neutral

886
00:39:58,298 --> 00:40:06,969
soils maelich three works on a broad

887
00:40:02,829 --> 00:40:09,309
range of soils it's used by a lot of

888
00:40:06,969 --> 00:40:14,768
commercial soil testing labs dairy one

889
00:40:09,309 --> 00:40:16,720
has a male 3 package Olson is a test

890
00:40:14,768 --> 00:40:19,469
that was developed for use on alkaline

891
00:40:16,719 --> 00:40:22,238
soils mostly out in the western US

892
00:40:19,469 --> 00:40:26,048
Morgan which is also available through

893
00:40:22,239 --> 00:40:28,239
dairy one or a girl one was developed

894
00:40:26,048 --> 00:40:31,960
for the acid soils here in the Northeast

895
00:40:28,239 --> 00:40:35,528
and the modified Morgan is just a

896
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:37,568
modification that provides improved

897
00:40:35,528 --> 00:40:39,309
micronutrient extraction the difference

898
00:40:37,568 --> 00:40:42,719
between those two is a Morgan uses a

899
00:40:39,309 --> 00:40:45,970
sodium acetate extraction and the

900
00:40:42,719 --> 00:40:47,949
modified Morgan uses ammonium acetate

901
00:40:45,969 --> 00:40:52,419
now explain a little bit more about that

902
00:40:47,949 --> 00:40:55,239
in a few moments then once you get your

903
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:57,519
soil test results typically you'll see

904
00:40:55,239 --> 00:41:01,869
different you might have bar graphs that

905
00:40:57,518 --> 00:41:04,959
show the relative levels and on the soil

906
00:41:01,869 --> 00:41:08,588
test and they're basically calibrated

907
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:11,289
you know soil test levels but on one

908
00:41:08,588 --> 00:41:15,460
axis versus relative yield on the other

909
00:41:11,289 --> 00:41:17,860
axis and very quite simply it's an index

910
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:19,840
of availability and crap response so

911
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:22,180
if you're in that very low too low range

912
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:24,789
on a soil test it's very likely that

913
00:41:22,179 --> 00:41:27,819
you're going to your crab will respond

914
00:41:24,789 --> 00:41:31,840
to added inputs of lime and fertilizer

915
00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:33,850
if you're in that optimum range it's

916
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:35,980
less likely that you're going to see a

917
00:41:33,849 --> 00:41:38,349
big response to fertilizer you're more

918
00:41:35,980 --> 00:41:40,510
likely to be you know using maintenance

919
00:41:38,349 --> 00:41:43,420
applications to keep your soil test

920
00:41:40,510 --> 00:41:45,690
levels in the adoptable range and then

921
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:49,269
as you get up into the hide a very high

922
00:41:45,690 --> 00:41:50,940
range it's very unlikely or less likely

923
00:41:49,269 --> 00:41:53,710
certainly that you'll have any

924
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:58,179
significant response to edit fertilizer

925
00:41:53,710 --> 00:42:02,320
or lime so this is basically how those

926
00:41:58,179 --> 00:42:09,579
soil test interpretations are created

927
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:13,620
and in the Cornell interpretation if you

928
00:42:09,579 --> 00:42:16,059
look in the Cornell field crops handbook

929
00:42:13,619 --> 00:42:18,429
it basically it goes into a little bit

930
00:42:16,059 --> 00:42:22,090
more detail here but basically the same

931
00:42:18,429 --> 00:42:24,789
thing from very low nutrient level or pH

932
00:42:22,090 --> 00:42:26,800
is sufficiently low that you really do

933
00:42:24,789 --> 00:42:29,710
need extra inputs of lime or fertilizer

934
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:32,800
all the way up to excess we're very

935
00:42:29,710 --> 00:42:35,470
unlikely do you have any benefit but it

936
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:39,130
is very likely to cause it to increase

937
00:42:35,469 --> 00:42:41,379
the likelihood of pollution so there

938
00:42:39,130 --> 00:42:44,200
they're both very important to

939
00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:48,849
understand those ranges and as I

940
00:42:44,199 --> 00:42:52,750
mentioned already most soil tests do not

941
00:42:48,849 --> 00:42:55,829
routinely include boron boron can be

942
00:42:52,750 --> 00:42:58,360
very important for some of the fruits so

943
00:42:55,829 --> 00:43:02,349
you want to keep that in mind as well

944
00:42:58,360 --> 00:43:04,829
and there are different tests but what

945
00:43:02,349 --> 00:43:07,179
we're using is a hot water boron

946
00:43:04,829 --> 00:43:10,539
analysis which is the the preferred

947
00:43:07,179 --> 00:43:12,579
procedure by Cornell and it would be

948
00:43:10,539 --> 00:43:15,340
consistent with these relative ranges

949
00:43:12,579 --> 00:43:19,569
that you find in some of the Cornell

950
00:43:15,340 --> 00:43:22,780
literature and some of the analysis

951
00:43:19,570 --> 00:43:26,440
options specifically for for Agri one

952
00:43:22,780 --> 00:43:28,210
just as an example you really need to

953
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:29,769
you might need to study these a little

954
00:43:28,210 --> 00:43:31,750
bit because it would be easy to select

955
00:43:29,769 --> 00:43:33,940
the the wrong

956
00:43:31,750 --> 00:43:36,280
service and you want to make sure if you

957
00:43:33,940 --> 00:43:38,500
want to get Cornell recommendations that

958
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:41,710
you select the air grow one services

959
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:44,710
with Cornell guidelines as I mentioned

960
00:43:41,710 --> 00:43:49,690
before the field crops are using a

961
00:43:44,710 --> 00:43:52,210
Morgan analysis everything else will be

962
00:43:49,690 --> 00:43:54,880
modified Morgan fruit vegetable turf

963
00:43:52,210 --> 00:43:57,099
home lawn and garden the out-of-state

964
00:43:54,880 --> 00:44:00,640
soil health samples will also be run

965
00:43:57,099 --> 00:44:05,469
modified Morgan and actually right now

966
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:07,779
in the arena of root of fruit if you

967
00:44:05,469 --> 00:44:11,049
want to get recommendations from agri

968
00:44:07,780 --> 00:44:13,120
one you really have to use one of the

969
00:44:11,050 --> 00:44:14,980
the air grow one services with Cornell

970
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:17,829
guidelines you'd probably have to go

971
00:44:14,980 --> 00:44:20,409
through the soil health option if you're

972
00:44:17,829 --> 00:44:22,719
out of state we currently don't have

973
00:44:20,409 --> 00:44:24,730
recommendations programmed in for the

974
00:44:22,719 --> 00:44:27,909
air grow one services with air grow one

975
00:44:24,730 --> 00:44:30,940
guidelines they're coming but we don't

976
00:44:27,909 --> 00:44:33,129
have those at this time for the air grow

977
00:44:30,940 --> 00:44:36,579
one services with air grow one

978
00:44:33,130 --> 00:44:38,800
guidelines we we do conduct a maelich

979
00:44:36,579 --> 00:44:40,989
three analysis and it's a little bit

980
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:44,860
more cost effective than Malick three

981
00:44:40,989 --> 00:44:48,129
then Morgan or modified Morgan and

982
00:44:44,860 --> 00:44:50,829
there's a number of reasons for that one

983
00:44:48,130 --> 00:44:53,019
of which it's much less corrosive easier

984
00:44:50,829 --> 00:44:55,299
tests to run less you know waste

985
00:44:53,019 --> 00:44:57,070
byproducts that dispose of less

986
00:44:55,300 --> 00:45:00,550
labor-intensive so that there are

987
00:44:57,070 --> 00:45:02,980
reasons for the price differences on the

988
00:45:00,550 --> 00:45:05,650
four Pennsylvania we offer a male like

989
00:45:02,980 --> 00:45:08,619
three from Maryland they require a male

990
00:45:05,650 --> 00:45:12,550
like three with fertilizer index value

991
00:45:08,619 --> 00:45:14,409
which is a calculated value for New York

992
00:45:12,550 --> 00:45:19,660
we can do a male at three with Morgan

993
00:45:14,409 --> 00:45:22,659
equivalent values reported and for other

994
00:45:19,659 --> 00:45:25,659
Northeast states we run maelich three

995
00:45:22,659 --> 00:45:27,549
analysis we do on occasion get samples

996
00:45:25,659 --> 00:45:29,619
from outside of the Northeast in which

997
00:45:27,550 --> 00:45:34,900
case we will run a maelich three with

998
00:45:29,619 --> 00:45:36,819
generic recommendations that are maybe

999
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:38,380
not state specific if we got something

1000
00:45:36,820 --> 00:45:40,660
from Colorado we don't have

1001
00:45:38,380 --> 00:45:42,670
recommendations for Colorado so they

1002
00:45:40,659 --> 00:45:44,799
would be more generic northeast

1003
00:45:42,670 --> 00:45:48,190
recommendations so

1004
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:50,590
keep that in mind if you wanted to send

1005
00:45:48,190 --> 00:45:53,619
samples to dairy one for example and

1006
00:45:50,590 --> 00:45:55,720
then we also run a modified Morgan for

1007
00:45:53,619 --> 00:45:58,539
Vermont and there is a difference I know

1008
00:45:55,719 --> 00:46:00,399
this sounds confusing but there are some

1009
00:45:58,539 --> 00:46:02,559
minor differences between the

1010
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:05,410
requirements the modified Morgan

1011
00:46:02,559 --> 00:46:07,989
procedures for Vermont and New York and

1012
00:46:05,409 --> 00:46:10,960
Maude and Vermont we use a ICP

1013
00:46:07,989 --> 00:46:12,429
phosphorus which is just a ICP as the

1014
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:16,559
piece of equipment that we use to

1015
00:46:12,429 --> 00:46:20,559
extract and determine the nutrients in

1016
00:46:16,559 --> 00:46:22,509
New York we use a modified Morgan but we

1017
00:46:20,559 --> 00:46:24,519
do a color metric phosphorus just a

1018
00:46:22,510 --> 00:46:26,910
minor difference but it's a different

1019
00:46:24,519 --> 00:46:30,400
requirement according to the state

1020
00:46:26,909 --> 00:46:32,019
specifications and there are other labs

1021
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:34,480
in the Northeast it offers similar

1022
00:46:32,019 --> 00:46:37,420
services as i mentioned main does a

1023
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:40,119
modified morgan penn state as a maelich

1024
00:46:37,420 --> 00:46:42,849
three and there are other commercial

1025
00:46:40,119 --> 00:46:45,159
labs that that do a lot of business in

1026
00:46:42,849 --> 00:46:47,529
the Northeast and over the US who offer

1027
00:46:45,159 --> 00:46:50,559
various services so you just need to

1028
00:46:47,530 --> 00:46:52,720
check with them but just remember don't

1029
00:46:50,559 --> 00:46:56,289
use test results from one lab or a

1030
00:46:52,719 --> 00:46:58,569
procedure from one lab and compare it

1031
00:46:56,289 --> 00:47:03,340
with sufficiency ranges from another lab

1032
00:46:58,570 --> 00:47:08,559
or another procedure you need to keep

1033
00:47:03,340 --> 00:47:11,140
that in mind and just as an example here

1034
00:47:08,559 --> 00:47:13,809
in New York and in our services for

1035
00:47:11,139 --> 00:47:16,059
example a male 3 versus a Morgan you

1036
00:47:13,809 --> 00:47:18,400
might wonder well you know how different

1037
00:47:16,059 --> 00:47:20,829
could they be well with a male like

1038
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:23,410
three is going to extract potentially

1039
00:47:20,829 --> 00:47:27,549
anywhere from 30 to 300 times more

1040
00:47:23,409 --> 00:47:30,699
phosphorus at high aluminum oil levels

1041
00:47:27,550 --> 00:47:33,789
at low ph s and it will express extract

1042
00:47:30,699 --> 00:47:37,389
less phosphorus at a high pH or low

1043
00:47:33,789 --> 00:47:39,279
aluminum so that's very different and so

1044
00:47:37,389 --> 00:47:41,199
if you're comparing me a mail like three

1045
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:43,570
that you did last year with a Morgan

1046
00:47:41,199 --> 00:47:46,779
that you're doing this year you could

1047
00:47:43,570 --> 00:47:49,600
get very different numbers the modified

1048
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:51,700
Morgan versus Morgan they're pretty

1049
00:47:49,599 --> 00:47:53,920
comparable overall but you will see

1050
00:47:51,699 --> 00:47:57,429
difference on potassium values on some

1051
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:58,180
soils the ammonium acetate and modified

1052
00:47:57,429 --> 00:48:00,849
Morgan

1053
00:47:58,179 --> 00:48:04,539
that ammonium ion is smaller than sodium

1054
00:48:00,849 --> 00:48:07,000
in the the Morgan extractant and it'll

1055
00:48:04,539 --> 00:48:09,659
push that potassium that's trapped

1056
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:12,369
between clay particles in the LA elight

1057
00:48:09,659 --> 00:48:14,349
clay parent material in some New York

1058
00:48:12,369 --> 00:48:16,630
soils so it'll push more that that

1059
00:48:14,349 --> 00:48:18,849
potassium out into the soil solution so

1060
00:48:16,630 --> 00:48:23,530
it'll give a higher potassium number

1061
00:48:18,849 --> 00:48:25,900
than a Morgan extractant would otherwise

1062
00:48:23,530 --> 00:48:29,460
they're they're quite comparable so

1063
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:31,930
which lab should you use well I guess

1064
00:48:29,460 --> 00:48:33,490
you should you should use a lab that

1065
00:48:31,929 --> 00:48:34,869
offers procedures and nutrient

1066
00:48:33,489 --> 00:48:37,899
guidelines that are appropriate for your

1067
00:48:34,869 --> 00:48:39,639
region and for your soils don't use test

1068
00:48:37,900 --> 00:48:41,619
results from one labor procedure and

1069
00:48:39,639 --> 00:48:43,239
sufficiency ranges from another lab or

1070
00:48:41,619 --> 00:48:46,089
procedure as I've already explained they

1071
00:48:43,239 --> 00:48:49,689
can get you in trouble and get you very

1072
00:48:46,090 --> 00:48:52,240
confused use caution even when you're

1073
00:48:49,690 --> 00:48:53,800
comparing one lab to another even when

1074
00:48:52,239 --> 00:48:55,869
they're using the same extractant

1075
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:59,320
because there can be some lab to lab

1076
00:48:55,869 --> 00:49:01,359
variability for the same procedure some

1077
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:04,150
might way the sample others might use a

1078
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:06,730
scoop some might use ICP phosphorus

1079
00:49:04,150 --> 00:49:08,500
versus color metric phosphorus the soil

1080
00:49:06,730 --> 00:49:10,449
the solution ratio might be a little

1081
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:12,219
different or the shaking time might be a

1082
00:49:10,449 --> 00:49:14,409
little different and all of these subtle

1083
00:49:12,219 --> 00:49:16,689
differences even the grinder that they

1084
00:49:14,409 --> 00:49:19,000
use to grind the dried sample can be a

1085
00:49:16,690 --> 00:49:22,360
little bit different and all of these

1086
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:24,610
subtle differences can result in some

1087
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:28,539
variability that's that they can be

1088
00:49:24,610 --> 00:49:30,280
confusing so stick with the same lab if

1089
00:49:28,539 --> 00:49:33,369
possible once you find when you're

1090
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:36,280
comfortable with and be careful when

1091
00:49:33,369 --> 00:49:38,679
you're comparing one lab to another the

1092
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:42,990
report this is just a sample of our

1093
00:49:38,679 --> 00:49:46,239
fruit report up towards the the the top

1094
00:49:42,989 --> 00:49:48,969
you'll see the the results reported in

1095
00:49:46,239 --> 00:49:51,639
pounds per acre but then you'll have the

1096
00:49:48,969 --> 00:49:56,139
relative sufficiency levels the very low

1097
00:49:51,639 --> 00:49:58,089
low optimum high or very high below that

1098
00:49:56,139 --> 00:50:00,789
you'll have some of the other

1099
00:49:58,090 --> 00:50:04,210
measurements such as pH or buffer ph

1100
00:50:00,789 --> 00:50:06,460
which is used to determine your lime

1101
00:50:04,210 --> 00:50:09,070
requirement and you'll also see down

1102
00:50:06,460 --> 00:50:10,690
below the the micronutrients that are

1103
00:50:09,070 --> 00:50:11,830
included in the standard package

1104
00:50:10,690 --> 00:50:15,070
including manganese

1105
00:50:11,829 --> 00:50:17,769
he's in zinc and iron and we also

1106
00:50:15,070 --> 00:50:20,130
provide organic matter and then farther

1107
00:50:17,769 --> 00:50:22,989
down below that you'll see the actual

1108
00:50:20,130 --> 00:50:25,360
fertilizer recommendations in this case

1109
00:50:22,989 --> 00:50:28,000
it was a Apple report I should have

1110
00:50:25,360 --> 00:50:31,000
pulled up a blueberry or a berry report

1111
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:34,570
but this will give you the the pounds

1112
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:39,119
per acre of lime and the pounds per acre

1113
00:50:34,570 --> 00:50:42,610
of n p 2 o 5 and k2 oh that's required

1114
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:45,069
to bring that crop or that soil into the

1115
00:50:42,610 --> 00:50:48,430
appropriate balance now I would say with

1116
00:50:45,070 --> 00:50:52,450
with apples we do have a surface and

1117
00:50:48,429 --> 00:50:55,059
subsurface option with apples and if you

1118
00:50:52,449 --> 00:50:57,009
do have a paired sample for a surface

1119
00:50:55,059 --> 00:50:59,920
which would be 0 to 8 and subsurface

1120
00:50:57,010 --> 00:51:02,620
which is 8 to 16 you need to indicate

1121
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:04,960
that they're paired samples and that is

1122
00:51:02,619 --> 00:51:07,750
used in generating one recommendation

1123
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:14,610
based on the paired samples but that's

1124
00:51:07,750 --> 00:51:19,480
only true of tree fruits not berries and

1125
00:51:14,610 --> 00:51:22,559
just finally in summary I think we all

1126
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:25,150
know soil testing is is very important

1127
00:51:22,559 --> 00:51:27,070
part of the whole process if you have to

1128
00:51:25,150 --> 00:51:30,160
want to optimize yield and quality of

1129
00:51:27,070 --> 00:51:34,360
berries and avoid issues with a runoff

1130
00:51:30,159 --> 00:51:37,659
into groundwater or runoff into bodies

1131
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:41,079
of water like any other analytical

1132
00:51:37,659 --> 00:51:43,329
service it's garbage in garbage out or

1133
00:51:41,079 --> 00:51:46,239
quality and quality out so you've got to

1134
00:51:43,329 --> 00:51:48,969
get a good sample upfront and follow

1135
00:51:46,239 --> 00:51:51,039
some of the basic guidelines that I

1136
00:51:48,969 --> 00:51:53,579
provided relative to establishing a

1137
00:51:51,039 --> 00:51:56,619
sampling schedule using the right tools

1138
00:51:53,579 --> 00:51:59,349
sampling at the right depth taking

1139
00:51:56,619 --> 00:52:01,029
enough sub-samples and prepping that

1140
00:51:59,349 --> 00:52:04,000
sample properly to get a good

1141
00:52:01,030 --> 00:52:06,820
representative composite sample in

1142
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:09,309
appropriate boxes or bags from the lab

1143
00:52:06,820 --> 00:52:11,320
and then to select the appropriate

1144
00:52:09,309 --> 00:52:15,639
service whether you're using a routine

1145
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:17,769
or a diagnostic service and select the

1146
00:52:15,639 --> 00:52:19,839
appropriate extractant whether it's

1147
00:52:17,769 --> 00:52:22,329
morgan modified Morgan or maelich three

1148
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:25,690
and you know what the lab has to offer

1149
00:52:22,329 --> 00:52:28,659
and and then following up

1150
00:52:25,690 --> 00:52:30,670
every two to three years preferably with

1151
00:52:28,659 --> 00:52:34,750
tissue analysis in the case of berries

1152
00:52:30,670 --> 00:52:37,180
and I know I covered a lot a lot of it

1153
00:52:34,750 --> 00:52:38,829
was probably a review if you do have any

1154
00:52:37,179 --> 00:52:45,519
other questions you can go to our

1155
00:52:38,829 --> 00:52:50,110
website at ww.com or you can email me at

1156
00:52:45,519 --> 00:52:52,989
Janet Fallon at Dairy 1.com and there is

1157
00:52:50,110 --> 00:52:55,120
one mistake on that hit slide I'm just

1158
00:52:52,989 --> 00:52:57,489
seeing my cell phone number is no longer

1159
00:52:55,119 --> 00:52:59,859
the one that's on the screen so write

1160
00:52:57,489 --> 00:53:07,529
this down if you do have a question for

1161
00:52:59,860 --> 00:53:10,930
me my cell phone number is now 3 15 6960

1162
00:53:07,530 --> 00:53:13,360
167 if you have any questions I'd be

1163
00:53:10,929 --> 00:53:16,359
happy to answer those for you and if I

1164
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:18,760
don't have an answer I can certainly get

1165
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:22,539
one from from Marvin and get back to you

1166
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:24,790
promptly so that's pretty much it Cathy

1167
00:53:22,539 --> 00:53:26,650
I know we're getting close on time here

1168
00:53:24,789 --> 00:53:30,610
so if we have any other questions I'll

1169
00:53:26,650 --> 00:53:35,710
try and answer them do we have any

1170
00:53:30,610 --> 00:53:39,039
questions Mariana has a question I have

1171
00:53:35,710 --> 00:53:40,510
several growers wanting to grow organic

1172
00:53:39,039 --> 00:53:42,579
are there any recommendations for

1173
00:53:40,510 --> 00:53:46,450
organic growers or a way to convert the

1174
00:53:42,579 --> 00:53:49,659
recommendations that are given that's a

1175
00:53:46,449 --> 00:53:52,989
good question basically a soil test

1176
00:53:49,659 --> 00:53:55,980
really isn't going to differentiate

1177
00:53:52,989 --> 00:53:59,379
between an organic or so-called

1178
00:53:55,980 --> 00:54:01,389
conventional operation because the crop

1179
00:53:59,380 --> 00:54:03,340
nutrient requirements will be the same

1180
00:54:01,389 --> 00:54:06,400
regardless it's all in the

1181
00:54:03,340 --> 00:54:09,460
interpretation and I do know that

1182
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:12,160
Cornell has been working very diligently

1183
00:54:09,460 --> 00:54:17,889
at coming up with some updated

1184
00:54:12,159 --> 00:54:21,279
guidelines for using organic fertilizer

1185
00:54:17,889 --> 00:54:22,900
sources of crop nutrients and as soon as

1186
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:24,310
those are available from Cornell they

1187
00:54:22,900 --> 00:54:27,849
would be incorporated into the

1188
00:54:24,309 --> 00:54:30,549
recommendations but basically we're just

1189
00:54:27,849 --> 00:54:33,759
giving recommendation on pounds of n P

1190
00:54:30,550 --> 00:54:36,190
and K to apply to a crop to bring that

1191
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:39,440
to a soil to bring it into balance it's

1192
00:54:36,190 --> 00:54:42,079
really up to the operator to meet the

1193
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:43,849
is needs with whatever source of

1194
00:54:42,079 --> 00:54:45,680
nutrients they choose to use whether

1195
00:54:43,849 --> 00:54:47,450
it's organic and and certainly with

1196
00:54:45,679 --> 00:54:50,088
organic it's very different because you

1197
00:54:47,449 --> 00:54:52,848
tend to be using more organic excuse me

1198
00:54:50,088 --> 00:54:56,509
um well yeah not synthetic chemicals but

1199
00:54:52,849 --> 00:54:59,510
organic that may be slower in releasing

1200
00:54:56,510 --> 00:55:01,670
nutrients so it's I think using that

1201
00:54:59,510 --> 00:55:04,310
soil health program I think is is

1202
00:55:01,670 --> 00:55:06,230
probably going to be a good way to

1203
00:55:04,309 --> 00:55:09,699
address that issue for the organic

1204
00:55:06,230 --> 00:55:12,619
growers because it does address the the

1205
00:55:09,699 --> 00:55:15,679
physical and biological health of the

1206
00:55:12,619 --> 00:55:19,490
soil as well and there are a number of

1207
00:55:15,679 --> 00:55:23,179
resources listed on both the air grow

1208
00:55:19,489 --> 00:55:25,219
one link and also on the Cornell links

1209
00:55:23,179 --> 00:55:28,098
that would would send you to information

1210
00:55:25,219 --> 00:55:31,519
on some of the organic amendments for

1211
00:55:28,099 --> 00:55:35,000
meeting crop nutrient requirements so

1212
00:55:31,519 --> 00:55:36,739
that's it's sort of a yes and no a soil

1213
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:40,940
test doesn't differentiate between the

1214
00:55:36,739 --> 00:55:43,459
two okay we have a question from Glen

1215
00:55:40,940 --> 00:55:45,588
how long does lime correction of pH

1216
00:55:43,460 --> 00:55:49,579
typically laughs before real iming is

1217
00:55:45,588 --> 00:55:52,578
needed well again that one is going to

1218
00:55:49,579 --> 00:55:55,670
depend a lot on a number of things

1219
00:55:52,579 --> 00:55:57,530
including soil texture the parent

1220
00:55:55,670 --> 00:55:59,980
material the soil and how much nitrogen

1221
00:55:57,530 --> 00:56:05,180
you're applying or other acidifying

1222
00:55:59,980 --> 00:56:06,380
fertilizers it because it you know if

1223
00:56:05,179 --> 00:56:07,848
you're applying large amounts of

1224
00:56:06,380 --> 00:56:11,510
nitrogen for example that's going to

1225
00:56:07,849 --> 00:56:15,950
bring the ph down faster if a soul has a

1226
00:56:11,510 --> 00:56:19,280
high buffer capacity it's going to

1227
00:56:15,949 --> 00:56:22,009
resist changes in pH up or down more so

1228
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:24,410
you might hold that pH longer once you

1229
00:56:22,010 --> 00:56:27,680
get it up to the desired pH if you have

1230
00:56:24,409 --> 00:56:31,309
a real sandy soil with a low cation

1231
00:56:27,679 --> 00:56:34,818
exchange capacity for example that soil

1232
00:56:31,309 --> 00:56:36,739
pH may change more rapidly so a lot of

1233
00:56:34,818 --> 00:56:40,159
it is going to depend on on the soil

1234
00:56:36,739 --> 00:56:42,739
resource that you're working with and

1235
00:56:40,159 --> 00:56:44,269
there's a comment from Marvin that the

1236
00:56:42,739 --> 00:56:47,539
end raise production guides provide

1237
00:56:44,269 --> 00:56:49,670
tables with organic nutrient sources and

1238
00:56:47,539 --> 00:56:51,949
you can use those to calculate how much

1239
00:56:49,670 --> 00:56:52,909
of an organic source you need based on

1240
00:56:51,949 --> 00:56:56,599
the soil test

1241
00:56:52,909 --> 00:56:58,460
dation Bob also has a question he's

1242
00:56:56,599 --> 00:57:00,259
wondering if you are Marvin could talk

1243
00:56:58,460 --> 00:57:02,720
more about the Cornell soil health test

1244
00:57:00,260 --> 00:57:05,230
and how they if they've been used for

1245
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:05,230
Barry crops

1246
00:57:07,340 --> 00:57:15,010
I know that that Bob Shindo vet Beck has

1247
00:57:11,599 --> 00:57:19,219
been working very extensively with

1248
00:57:15,010 --> 00:57:22,730
vegetable and fruit growers but I really

1249
00:57:19,219 --> 00:57:25,399
haven't been privy to you know who and

1250
00:57:22,730 --> 00:57:28,039
what the results have been on that maybe

1251
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:31,190
Marvin can type in some some comments on

1252
00:57:28,039 --> 00:57:34,159
that as well but it is something that

1253
00:57:31,190 --> 00:57:37,309
they are targeting the higher value

1254
00:57:34,159 --> 00:57:39,500
crops especially such as the fruits and

1255
00:57:37,309 --> 00:57:41,719
vegetables simply the testing is a bit

1256
00:57:39,500 --> 00:57:45,260
more costly than standard soil testing

1257
00:57:41,719 --> 00:57:47,480
as you would imagine and on high viu

1258
00:57:45,260 --> 00:57:50,270
crops it certainly is is worthwhile

1259
00:57:47,480 --> 00:57:52,969
because it's a long-term investment to

1260
00:57:50,269 --> 00:57:58,460
get that crap established and keep it

1261
00:57:52,969 --> 00:58:00,529
productive Laura McDermott is commented

1262
00:57:58,460 --> 00:58:03,800
that she's used Cornell so health test

1263
00:58:00,530 --> 00:58:06,350
with Barry crops and one of the purposes

1264
00:58:03,800 --> 00:58:09,170
of this project in year two when we

1265
00:58:06,349 --> 00:58:11,239
involve the growers is to help build

1266
00:58:09,170 --> 00:58:15,920
that database for Bob Shindo back and

1267
00:58:11,239 --> 00:58:17,259
for held vaness and so we have 50

1268
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:19,760
growers that are going to get

1269
00:58:17,260 --> 00:58:23,300
complimentary soil health testing so

1270
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:26,710
that we can start to do that well one

1271
00:58:23,300 --> 00:58:30,019
thing I would like to just add is that

1272
00:58:26,710 --> 00:58:32,510
we do have a number of extension

1273
00:58:30,019 --> 00:58:36,259
educators in New York who are currently

1274
00:58:32,510 --> 00:58:38,840
set up on our searchable database and

1275
00:58:36,260 --> 00:58:44,780
they can go online right now and search

1276
00:58:38,840 --> 00:58:46,910
by farmer by date by county for example

1277
00:58:44,780 --> 00:58:49,370
for soil tests and also by crop

1278
00:58:46,909 --> 00:58:53,239
commodity whether it's fruit or

1279
00:58:49,369 --> 00:58:55,819
vegetable or field crops and I believe

1280
00:58:53,239 --> 00:58:58,339
sometime around November one we should

1281
00:58:55,820 --> 00:59:00,500
be launching that service to all of our

1282
00:58:58,340 --> 00:59:04,730
customers who have an account so if

1283
00:59:00,500 --> 00:59:06,679
you're an Extension educator check out

1284
00:59:04,730 --> 00:59:09,500
our website here in the next month or so

1285
00:59:06,679 --> 00:59:12,319
and there should be some guidelines on

1286
00:59:09,500 --> 00:59:15,019
how to get assigned a username and a

1287
00:59:12,320 --> 00:59:16,910
password and will be planning a little

1288
00:59:15,019 --> 00:59:19,070
webinar to walk people through the

1289
00:59:16,909 --> 00:59:21,199
process of how to find their soil test

1290
00:59:19,070 --> 00:59:22,880
reports and then you can

1291
00:59:21,199 --> 00:59:26,480
so download some of that information

1292
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:28,730
into tables or spreadsheet so you can

1293
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:31,070
compare trends over time maybe obviously

1294
00:59:28,730 --> 00:59:32,659
you won't have any history the first

1295
00:59:31,070 --> 00:59:34,220
time you start using us but after a

1296
00:59:32,659 --> 00:59:37,759
number of years and a number of cycles

1297
00:59:34,219 --> 00:59:39,829
soil testing you'd have some comparative

1298
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:41,630
information or if you want to do county

1299
00:59:39,829 --> 00:59:45,159
summaries for example that's another

1300
00:59:41,630 --> 00:59:47,510
good use for the searchable database

1301
00:59:45,159 --> 00:59:49,099
Marvin did have a comment also that

1302
00:59:47,510 --> 00:59:50,990
we're just starting to use soil health

1303
00:59:49,099 --> 00:59:52,699
test for berries we don't have major

1304
00:59:50,989 --> 00:59:55,459
results yet the vegetable growers are

1305
00:59:52,699 --> 00:59:57,619
out in front on this and we also have a

1306
00:59:55,460 --> 00:59:59,659
question from Jeff are there any studies

1307
00:59:57,619 --> 01:00:01,730
on the intensity of soil sampling and

1308
00:59:59,659 --> 01:00:05,719
the repeatability of results in small

1309
01:00:01,730 --> 01:00:07,969
fruit production I have a feeling that

1310
01:00:05,719 --> 01:00:09,739
Marvin has an answer to that one too and

1311
01:00:07,969 --> 01:00:11,689
I have to believe that there are I know

1312
01:00:09,739 --> 01:00:15,949
there's been a lot of work done with

1313
01:00:11,690 --> 01:00:19,340
grid sampling and intensity of soil

1314
01:00:15,949 --> 01:00:24,949
sampling and repeatability I've seen it

1315
01:00:19,340 --> 01:00:28,160
with with field crops Marvin I see he's

1316
01:00:24,949 --> 01:00:29,719
typing frantically here I would have to

1317
01:00:28,159 --> 01:00:32,329
guess that they has also been done for

1318
01:00:29,719 --> 01:00:37,159
for berries but I'm not the person to

1319
01:00:32,329 --> 01:00:39,889
ask sorry that's okay well we're waiting

1320
01:00:37,159 --> 01:00:46,009
for Marvin to type in his comments will

1321
01:00:39,889 --> 01:00:47,299
go to the exit screen and let's see so

1322
01:00:46,010 --> 01:00:49,070
he says the greatest source of

1323
01:00:47,300 --> 01:00:53,840
variability is in the sampling not in

1324
01:00:49,070 --> 01:00:55,490
the testing procedure okay if anyone

1325
01:00:53,840 --> 01:01:00,620
else has questions be sure to type them

1326
