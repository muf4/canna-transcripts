1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,339
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:04,339
University

3
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:09,910
I know that you heard cybersecurity like

4
00:00:08,109 --> 00:00:11,049
this is very different so I do I do two

5
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:12,370
very disparate things if you have

6
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:14,470
questions about cybersecurity or

7
00:00:12,369 --> 00:00:15,729
blockchain that's sort of 90% of my real

8
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:17,769
job at Stanford I'm happy to answer

9
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:19,300
those as well and this is kind of a 10%

10
00:00:17,769 --> 00:00:21,519
of my time where I wanted to get back

11
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:23,769
into protein engineering and so started

12
00:00:21,519 --> 00:00:26,469
to work with GFI GFI is kind of a

13
00:00:23,769 --> 00:00:28,210
think-tank we're a completely remote

14
00:00:26,469 --> 00:00:29,849
organization and so we don't have lab

15
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:31,868
space of our own but we support

16
00:00:29,849 --> 00:00:33,609
researchers at universities across the

17
00:00:31,868 --> 00:00:35,079
world we fund some research and we work

18
00:00:33,609 --> 00:00:36,519
with companies that are developing both

19
00:00:35,079 --> 00:00:38,739
plant-based meat which is what I'll talk

20
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:42,269
to you about today and clean meat or

21
00:00:38,738 --> 00:00:46,659
sell cultured meat part of the future of

22
00:00:42,268 --> 00:00:48,789
replacing some of our animals so one of

23
00:00:46,659 --> 00:00:50,558
our reasons for doing this in the first

24
00:00:48,789 --> 00:00:52,660
place is that we project that we're

25
00:00:50,558 --> 00:00:56,259
going to need to feed 10 billion people

26
00:00:52,659 --> 00:00:58,148
by and the way that we currently use the

27
00:00:56,259 --> 00:01:01,030
Earth's surface now in terms of how much

28
00:00:58,149 --> 00:01:02,710
land is devoted to habitable land how

29
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:03,969
much ocean how much how much as for us

30
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:05,530
how much is used for agriculture how

31
00:01:03,969 --> 00:01:07,269
much is used for livestock we think is

32
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:11,260
not going to be a sustainable way of

33
00:01:07,269 --> 00:01:13,869
eating we think that particularly the

34
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:16,180
amount of cropland and you're not a

35
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:18,040
braising land that goes toward livestock

36
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:20,200
is a relatively inefficient use of those

37
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:22,180
resources and so you can kind of argue

38
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:23,829
over whether these population

39
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:25,210
projections are going to be accurate and

40
00:01:23,829 --> 00:01:27,549
when I was giving a talk at the National

41
00:01:25,209 --> 00:01:28,659
Academies Steven Chu was the former

42
00:01:27,549 --> 00:01:30,280
Secretary of Energy was like no no I

43
00:01:28,659 --> 00:01:31,750
think that humans have an internal kind

44
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:33,040
of like quorum sensing mechanism and

45
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:34,329
that were going to see population start

46
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,530
to decline because he thinks that people

47
00:01:34,329 --> 00:01:36,939
are going to kind of look around and

48
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:38,469
realize that we're not using our

49
00:01:36,939 --> 00:01:40,209
research as efficiently and like control

50
00:01:38,469 --> 00:01:42,579
population I'm not sure that we're

51
00:01:40,209 --> 00:01:44,259
seeing that happen it's hard to argue

52
00:01:42,579 --> 00:01:45,640
it's hard to like kind of tell people

53
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:47,469
that things are going to be okay as long

54
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:48,700
as we just all decide to start having

55
00:01:47,469 --> 00:01:49,780
fewer children because I've tried to

56
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:50,950
make that argument including at the

57
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:52,510
National Academies and people are like

58
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:54,579
oh it's too late we're already in our

59
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:55,750
mid 30s and 40s we have them already so

60
00:01:54,579 --> 00:01:57,129
I think what we need to do is we need to

61
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:58,000
change the way that we're eating in the

62
00:01:57,129 --> 00:01:59,049
way that we're feeding those people

63
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,400
because we kind of need to assume that

64
00:01:59,049 --> 00:02:02,079
we are going to have more people in the

65
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:03,190
world who we are going to be to feed and

66
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:05,409
that this is going to be an inefficient

67
00:02:03,189 --> 00:02:07,030
system so why is it an inefficient

68
00:02:05,409 --> 00:02:08,560
system and from what kind of perspective

69
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:09,788
do we think of it as being inefficient

70
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,949
if we just look at it kind of

71
00:02:09,788 --> 00:02:13,929
thermodynamically inputs to outputs how

72
00:02:11,949 --> 00:02:15,519
many calories of feed need to go into

73
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:17,290
making an animal and then how many

74
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,490
calories of food can we get out of that

75
00:02:17,289 --> 00:02:20,829
animal we see

76
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:22,030
the majority of the livestock that we

77
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:23,890
watch like all the livestock that we use

78
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:26,860
are inefficient and in fact some of the

79
00:02:23,889 --> 00:02:28,329
primary you know more efficient species

80
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:30,160
we're not even talking about cows which

81
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:31,510
you know are inefficient large animals

82
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:33,549
some of the smaller animals that we grow

83
00:02:31,509 --> 00:02:35,079
like pigs and chickens and fish are also

84
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:37,270
very inefficient and since that the

85
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:38,860
amount of calories in that are converted

86
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:41,710
to calories out is somewhere around 10

87
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:44,320
to 12 percent for cattle it's even lower

88
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:46,750
for cattle is below 10 it's 8% there are

89
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:49,689
some species of farmed fish that can get

90
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:50,860
you up to like 20 or 22 percent but the

91
00:02:49,689 --> 00:02:52,840
way that they calculate that kind of

92
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:55,240
like the life cycle analysis of the

93
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:56,979
farmed fish in often cases in many cases

94
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:58,600
doesn't take into account the nutrients

95
00:02:56,979 --> 00:03:03,069
that it's getting from the kind of

96
00:02:58,599 --> 00:03:05,139
surrounding ocean that the farm is in so

97
00:03:03,069 --> 00:03:07,599
a lot of like farmed salmon they'll do

98
00:03:05,139 --> 00:03:09,250
off the coast of like me and they'll be

99
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:10,689
in these pens that are semipermeable

100
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:12,099
they are being able to get some

101
00:03:10,689 --> 00:03:13,300
nutrients from the surrounding ocean

102
00:03:12,099 --> 00:03:15,060
water and that's not taking into account

103
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:17,469
the LCA so that kind of sums up the

104
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:19,719
efficiency numbers um and actually

105
00:03:17,469 --> 00:03:21,490
they're running out of coastline to make

106
00:03:19,719 --> 00:03:23,560
farm salmon so the latest things that

107
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:25,930
they have bought companies are their

108
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:28,870
farming salmon have bought plots of land

109
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:31,480
in like Central Florida after they're

110
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:34,900
making just these incredibly large pens

111
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:36,099
on land filled with water kept very cool

112
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:37,689
will because salmon like a very cold

113
00:03:36,099 --> 00:03:40,840
environments even in Florida there's

114
00:03:37,689 --> 00:03:42,460
kind of like Ford really cool well you

115
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:43,930
know cool tanks that they're growing

116
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:46,300
farm salmon and so if you want to talk

117
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:47,650
about inefficiency and about the effects

118
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:50,050
on the environment not only do we

119
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:51,730
sometimes see that in farm fish we get

120
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:53,560
disease spread from the Pens into the

121
00:03:51,729 --> 00:03:55,569
ocean because they're these semi

122
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:57,729
permeable pens if we're going to try to

123
00:03:55,569 --> 00:04:00,849
grow fish that require cold water on

124
00:03:57,729 --> 00:04:02,199
land then we're really getting into to

125
00:04:00,849 --> 00:04:04,120
lower efficiencies and we think would be

126
00:04:02,199 --> 00:04:06,549
optimal for being able to feed as many

127
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:08,560
people as we do so we can also talk

128
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:09,910
about in terms of then food waste we

129
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,430
know that food waste is a problem in

130
00:04:09,909 --> 00:04:14,409
terms of recapturing nutrients that were

131
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:16,150
able to grow and produce and the amount

132
00:04:14,409 --> 00:04:18,250
of food wasted by consumers or in the

133
00:04:16,149 --> 00:04:19,870
supply chain is dwarfed in comparison to

134
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:23,730
the amount of food wasted in producing

135
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:25,160
chicken or beef as the most common

136
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:27,770
another way of look

137
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:30,800
that is that we devote quite a lot of

138
00:04:27,769 --> 00:04:32,299
our land mammal population to our pets

139
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:36,199
and livestock as opposed to wild animals

140
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:39,340
we also see some habitat loss kind of

141
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:43,729
off target effects of growing this many

142
00:04:39,339 --> 00:04:45,199
sheep goats pigs horses and cattle where

143
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:47,180
we're using a lot of land that could be

144
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:48,589
either used for crops or could be

145
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:51,620
preserved for natural environments using

146
00:04:48,589 --> 00:04:53,329
it to grow livestock so if we think that

147
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:55,389
that's a problem then why do we see that

148
00:04:53,329 --> 00:04:59,060
global demand for me is increasing

149
00:04:55,389 --> 00:05:00,949
across all categories of meats based on

150
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:05,240
both US and global demand we see that

151
00:05:00,949 --> 00:05:08,209
where we have increased demand for as

152
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:10,100
well as particularly increased demand in

153
00:05:08,209 --> 00:05:11,750
fast-growing and populations in

154
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:13,400
developing economies part of the reason

155
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:15,279
for that is that as people get richer

156
00:05:13,399 --> 00:05:17,870
they want to model their diets more on

157
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:19,039
traditionally Western diets they want to

158
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:21,379
eat more meat or me to see it as a

159
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:23,600
status symbol and so that's why we see

160
00:05:21,379 --> 00:05:26,290
some of the highest growth rates in

161
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:28,640
terms of meat consumption

162
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:30,830
so we're projected to eat a lot more

163
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:32,419
meat by 2050 and particularly a lot more

164
00:05:30,829 --> 00:05:33,800
chicken and that meat is going to have

165
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:35,090
to come from somewhere but hopefully it

166
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,680
doesn't have to come from the same

167
00:05:35,089 --> 00:05:38,329
system that's being used to produce it

168
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:41,720
another thing I want to point out is

169
00:05:38,329 --> 00:05:43,219
that we don't actually eat we don't

170
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:45,050
actually have like a protein deficit

171
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:47,480
we're eating much more protein than we

172
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:50,540
need particularly in wealthy regions for

173
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:52,069
some reason we're not all like buff and

174
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:54,230
muscle-bound so some of this protein is

175
00:05:52,069 --> 00:05:56,120
just kind of going waste but if you look

176
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:58,250
at the average daily protein requirement

177
00:05:56,120 --> 00:06:01,730
across different countries and how we're

178
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:02,779
meeting that requirement in many places

179
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:05,750
around the world we would be able to

180
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:08,659
meet all of that protein requirement

181
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:10,100
just with plant protein alone and not

182
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:11,900
need to take into account all the kind

183
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:15,800
of excess animal protein that we consume

184
00:06:11,899 --> 00:06:16,909
so taking that into account we want to

185
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,470
look at the idea of whether we can

186
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:21,439
replace some of the animal-based protein

187
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:22,760
that people are using so what our

188
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:24,469
plant-based proteins okay like this

189
00:06:22,759 --> 00:06:26,089
audience probably knows what those end

190
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:28,220
up becoming these are some of the

191
00:06:26,089 --> 00:06:29,449
plant-based meat products and

192
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:31,270
plant-based dairy products that are

193
00:06:29,449 --> 00:06:33,769
currently available it's anything from

194
00:06:31,269 --> 00:06:36,978
replacing chicken and beef in the

195
00:06:33,769 --> 00:06:38,870
sandwich to replacing cheeses other

196
00:06:36,978 --> 00:06:42,349
types of plant-based dairy

197
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:43,670
even additives in to combine products or

198
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:47,600
you'll have some animal needs and some

199
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:49,910
plant-based meat that are - product we

200
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:51,740
want again to look back at plant

201
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:53,270
proteins as replacing animal proteins

202
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:55,519
because they're more sustainable they're

203
00:06:53,269 --> 00:06:57,199
more sustainable in terms of land use in

204
00:06:55,519 --> 00:06:59,299
terms of water consumption in terms of

205
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:00,829
greenhouse gas emissions beef is the

206
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:02,840
least efficient animal meat in terms of

207
00:07:00,829 --> 00:07:04,699
land use but all animal meats the right

208
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:06,769
o - line perform worse in terms of all

209
00:07:04,699 --> 00:07:08,930
of these categories than plant-based

210
00:07:06,769 --> 00:07:10,339
foods do so if we want to transition

211
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:12,439
some of our protein consumption to more

212
00:07:10,339 --> 00:07:14,149
sustainable proteins it kind of moves us

213
00:07:12,439 --> 00:07:16,399
to look into plant proteins rather than

214
00:07:14,149 --> 00:07:20,539
trying to optimize maybe the efficiency

215
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:22,429
of pork or farm fish there's a long

216
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:24,560
history of plant-based meat but the

217
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:26,449
history of kind of the directed

218
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:29,240
engineering of plant-based products

219
00:07:26,449 --> 00:07:30,529
really happens in the last 15 or so

220
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:32,650
years with a Beyond burger and the

221
00:07:30,529 --> 00:07:34,909
impossible burger which I'll talk about

222
00:07:32,649 --> 00:07:37,609
newer products that these companies are

223
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:39,470
developing but my face meat we can kind

224
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:42,650
of trace back to some of the earliest

225
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:44,750
known meat substitutes things like tofu

226
00:07:42,649 --> 00:07:46,339
and Yuba and tempeh are kind of in a

227
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:47,870
category unto themselves in the sense

228
00:07:46,339 --> 00:07:51,469
that when we do market analyses we look

229
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:53,780
at like Nielsen spores of supermarket

230
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:56,660
sales in terms of plant-based meat

231
00:07:53,779 --> 00:07:58,159
category they don't lump tofu or tempeh

232
00:07:56,660 --> 00:08:00,710
or you buy into that category they think

233
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:02,270
them as a separate kind of a separate

234
00:08:00,709 --> 00:08:03,560
product so we're talking about time

235
00:08:02,269 --> 00:08:05,539
based meat sales we're talking only

236
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:06,860
about products that are like veggie

237
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:08,060
burgers or veggie sausage that are

238
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:10,220
specifically designed to replace a

239
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:12,439
particular meat components and not

240
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:14,540
something like tofu but we see

241
00:08:12,439 --> 00:08:16,430
historically that tofu and like wheat

242
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:21,740
gluten and they were used to replace

243
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:23,959
meat products as far back as 1915 for

244
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:26,000
tempeh and Indonesia some of the then

245
00:08:23,959 --> 00:08:28,489
not in peanut based meat substitutes

246
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,439
that were developed as well as tofu soy

247
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:31,790
based meat substitutes were aimed at a

248
00:08:30,439 --> 00:08:34,399
religious audience an audience that

249
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:37,729
didn't want to eat meat either one day a

250
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:40,370
week or for other religious holidays and

251
00:08:37,729 --> 00:08:42,560
these started to be commercialized by

252
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:45,409
John Kellogg and others at the start of

253
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:47,539
the 20th century the first u.s. meatless

254
00:08:45,409 --> 00:08:50,059
burger the soy burgers for 1937

255
00:08:47,539 --> 00:08:52,179
we see then the advent of textile

256
00:08:50,059 --> 00:08:54,399
manufacturing tools to produce

257
00:08:52,179 --> 00:08:56,079
dürdane spun soy protein fibers idiot

258
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:57,610
now we can take my proteins you can make

259
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:59,320
them into textures that look a bit more

260
00:08:57,610 --> 00:09:02,200
like muscle fibers and that replicate

261
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:03,240
better the texture of piece of meat and

262
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:06,040
then we started to see more

263
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:07,389
commercialization Morningstar farms or

264
00:09:06,039 --> 00:09:09,028
Fergie kind of the Boca burgers that you

265
00:09:07,389 --> 00:09:12,699
might have been familiar with in the 90s

266
00:09:09,028 --> 00:09:13,929
the FDA released in 1999 a statement

267
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:15,278
that consumption of soy protein may

268
00:09:13,929 --> 00:09:16,899
reduce the risk of heart disease that

269
00:09:15,278 --> 00:09:20,139
kind of improved marketing and

270
00:09:16,899 --> 00:09:22,600
commercialization and then beyond me and

271
00:09:20,139 --> 00:09:25,629
impossible foods were both founded in

272
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:28,240
the Bay Area both by chemists named

273
00:09:25,629 --> 00:09:29,679
Browns they are frequently confused but

274
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:31,269
two separate companies they make the

275
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:33,489
beyond burger and the impossible burger

276
00:09:31,269 --> 00:09:35,829
which they launched within about a year

277
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:37,209
of each other so all so confused but

278
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:38,740
well going to the differences between

279
00:09:37,208 --> 00:09:41,379
them and kind of some of the strategy

280
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:46,810
behind making these kind of more

281
00:09:41,379 --> 00:09:49,149
engineered plant protein burgers so a

282
00:09:46,809 --> 00:09:50,588
lot of what GFI wants to do is support

283
00:09:49,149 --> 00:09:52,149
companies to enter into this space and

284
00:09:50,589 --> 00:09:54,160
also just support research in the space

285
00:09:52,149 --> 00:09:57,850
and when we put out a call for proposals

286
00:09:54,159 --> 00:09:59,439
for plant-based researchers well why

287
00:09:57,850 --> 00:10:01,028
doing research on either you know

288
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,440
texturing of plant proteins extracting

289
00:10:01,028 --> 00:10:04,330
plant proteins growing plants that have

290
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:05,800
higher concentrations of proteins the

291
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:07,180
way that we categorize it is in terms of

292
00:10:05,799 --> 00:10:08,799
this mind map where we look at what goes

293
00:10:07,179 --> 00:10:11,229
into making plant-based me everything

294
00:10:08,799 --> 00:10:13,809
from sourcing a protein isolation and

295
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:15,670
functionalisation formulation processing

296
00:10:13,809 --> 00:10:16,750
and the distribution and we look for

297
00:10:15,669 --> 00:10:17,949
research that's going on in all of these

298
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:19,958
areas because we think that we're going

299
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:22,390
to need to have a process improvements

300
00:10:19,958 --> 00:10:24,250
across all pieces of this mind map in

301
00:10:22,389 --> 00:10:25,899
order to get to products that meet

302
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:27,820
consumer demand in terms of taste price

303
00:10:25,899 --> 00:10:31,838
and convenience and are able to replace

304
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:33,430
some of the animal-based meat market so

305
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:34,630
starting with ingredient sourcing to

306
00:10:33,429 --> 00:10:36,399
make fun based meat we have to have

307
00:10:34,629 --> 00:10:37,838
plants provide all of the raw materials

308
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:40,179
and not just the protein to provide the

309
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:41,650
carbohydrates the fat flavorings I'll

310
00:10:40,179 --> 00:10:43,049
talk a little bit later about why it's

311
00:10:41,649 --> 00:10:45,189
particularly difficult to incorporate

312
00:10:43,049 --> 00:10:46,659
plant-based fats into these products

313
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:49,529
when comparing it to something like

314
00:10:46,659 --> 00:10:51,730
that's naturally present in beef or pork

315
00:10:49,528 --> 00:10:53,409
so this can involve things like crop

316
00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:56,139
engineering and breeding genomic trait

317
00:10:53,409 --> 00:10:57,969
mapping to see which parts of the plant

318
00:10:56,139 --> 00:10:59,559
genome correspond to higher protein

319
00:10:57,970 --> 00:11:01,028
yields or high bioavailability of

320
00:10:59,559 --> 00:11:03,278
protein and it also involves looking at

321
00:11:01,028 --> 00:11:05,799
different sources of protein from things

322
00:11:03,278 --> 00:11:07,448
like algae even from

323
00:11:05,799 --> 00:11:09,458
plant sources like fungi that we usually

324
00:11:07,448 --> 00:11:12,818
kind of just lump in with with plant

325
00:11:09,458 --> 00:11:14,799
proteins when we look at what proteins

326
00:11:12,818 --> 00:11:17,068
from plants are used in plant based meat

327
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:19,719
right now it's still predominantly soy

328
00:11:17,068 --> 00:11:21,578
soy Qian wheat a kind of the three main

329
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:23,798
plant proteins that are used in plant

330
00:11:21,578 --> 00:11:25,539
based products and soy overall its most

331
00:11:23,798 --> 00:11:26,739
popular part of that is because soy is a

332
00:11:25,539 --> 00:11:28,088
complete proteins when you look at

333
00:11:26,739 --> 00:11:29,798
analyzing a plant protein you look at

334
00:11:28,089 --> 00:11:31,269
the PD cast core that looks at the

335
00:11:29,798 --> 00:11:33,009
concentrations of different amino acids

336
00:11:31,269 --> 00:11:35,649
in that protein and you want something

337
00:11:33,009 --> 00:11:39,068
that's as close to one as possible so

338
00:11:35,649 --> 00:11:40,989
that it has whole it has all the

339
00:11:39,068 --> 00:11:42,128
nutritional requirements of the amino

340
00:11:40,989 --> 00:11:45,548
acids that we cannot synthesize

341
00:11:42,129 --> 00:11:48,399
ourselves I Tara Lee and soy meats that

342
00:11:45,548 --> 00:11:50,289
soy is is around point nine to one you

343
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:52,958
can reach a PDK score of one by

344
00:11:50,289 --> 00:11:55,539
combining other plant proteins but that

345
00:11:52,958 --> 00:11:57,338
kind of nutritional completeness of soy

346
00:11:55,539 --> 00:11:59,948
protein is one of the main reasons why

347
00:11:57,339 --> 00:12:02,079
soy is predominantly used a part of it

348
00:11:59,948 --> 00:12:04,169
is also because plant proteins for a

349
00:12:02,078 --> 00:12:07,028
long time were used or thought of as

350
00:12:04,169 --> 00:12:08,738
kind of something that like a secondary

351
00:12:07,028 --> 00:12:12,249
use of these crops and so we have a lot

352
00:12:08,739 --> 00:12:14,829
of field space devoted to soy devoted to

353
00:12:12,249 --> 00:12:16,240
weed devoted to core and to feed crops

354
00:12:14,828 --> 00:12:18,789
are aiming to feed to feed livestock

355
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:20,499
into grows other sources and so that was

356
00:12:18,789 --> 00:12:23,708
part of the reason also for why we used

357
00:12:20,499 --> 00:12:26,170
these proteins even if they may not be

358
00:12:23,708 --> 00:12:31,748
the ones that most closely mimic animal

359
00:12:26,169 --> 00:12:33,248
proteins some of the studies that were

360
00:12:31,749 --> 00:12:35,709
looking at are how nutrition profiles

361
00:12:33,249 --> 00:12:37,240
vary across different grains where we

362
00:12:35,708 --> 00:12:39,308
might be able to extract not only the

363
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:40,869
protein but also the fiber and the fat

364
00:12:39,308 --> 00:12:42,368
from those grains to make more

365
00:12:40,869 --> 00:12:44,709
ingredients available for fight based

366
00:12:42,369 --> 00:12:47,230
meat so if you look at the macro

367
00:12:44,708 --> 00:12:49,388
nutrient content in cereal grains we see

368
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:51,490
a variety of protein concentrations but

369
00:12:49,389 --> 00:12:54,159
then also a broader range of variety in

370
00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:56,198
terms of fiber fat or oil that's

371
00:12:54,159 --> 00:12:58,298
available for extraction and then

372
00:12:56,198 --> 00:13:00,278
similarly the micronutrient content even

373
00:12:58,298 --> 00:13:01,269
among millets where there's a project

374
00:13:00,278 --> 00:13:03,458
that we work with at Berkeley that's

375
00:13:01,269 --> 00:13:05,528
trying to increase the cultivation of

376
00:13:03,458 --> 00:13:09,998
millet and study with the availability

377
00:13:05,528 --> 00:13:11,588
of protein in millet and also the millet

378
00:13:09,999 --> 00:13:14,019
is a lot more commonly grown in Europe

379
00:13:11,589 --> 00:13:15,790
not as much in the US the reason for

380
00:13:14,019 --> 00:13:16,990
that that they find is that they try to

381
00:13:15,789 --> 00:13:18,428
encourage farmers to switch over to

382
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:19,209
millet because there's not a strong

383
00:13:18,428 --> 00:13:20,259
militant

384
00:13:19,208 --> 00:13:21,578
u.s. they have trouble getting crop

385
00:13:20,259 --> 00:13:23,110
insurance for it and then because they

386
00:13:21,578 --> 00:13:25,448
can't insurance for they don't grow and

387
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:27,308
so it's kind of this catch-22 cycle of

388
00:13:25,448 --> 00:13:29,729
trying to get people to switch over it

389
00:13:27,308 --> 00:13:32,558
on a large scale to a new cereal crop

390
00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:34,119
but some of the benefits then of trying

391
00:13:32,558 --> 00:13:36,639
to extract protein from this crop is

392
00:13:34,119 --> 00:13:39,610
that you can also get the subsidiary

393
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:41,589
benefit of having better micronutrient

394
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:42,999
contents from that crop and so if you

395
00:13:41,589 --> 00:13:44,410
want a product that has a high iron

396
00:13:42,999 --> 00:13:46,050
concentration because you know that iron

397
00:13:44,409 --> 00:13:48,818
needs to kind of like a meaty taste

398
00:13:46,049 --> 00:13:50,528
relieves to more like a bloody taste you

399
00:13:48,818 --> 00:13:55,419
may want to have a crop that has higher

400
00:13:50,528 --> 00:13:58,299
levels firing another way that we're

401
00:13:55,419 --> 00:14:00,248
trying to study the variability in plant

402
00:13:58,299 --> 00:14:02,438
proteins is through how environmental

403
00:14:00,249 --> 00:14:04,089
conditions impact crop performance so

404
00:14:02,438 --> 00:14:05,860
even if we're growing the same crop we

405
00:14:04,089 --> 00:14:07,720
know that pH levels a nitrogen levels

406
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:09,789
can vary quite a bit and soil then we

407
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:13,540
may need to look at for example for pea

408
00:14:09,789 --> 00:14:15,009
varieties how growing pea varieties in

409
00:14:13,539 --> 00:14:16,509
in these different soil concentrations

410
00:14:15,009 --> 00:14:18,759
affects the protein content which is

411
00:14:16,509 --> 00:14:21,699
something that's usually not a part of a

412
00:14:18,759 --> 00:14:23,589
general yield study so what we're trying

413
00:14:21,698 --> 00:14:24,998
to do in supporting this research is to

414
00:14:23,589 --> 00:14:26,470
optimize these crops to improve the raw

415
00:14:24,999 --> 00:14:27,819
materials we want to improve the

416
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:28,959
nutrition and the functionality and the

417
00:14:27,818 --> 00:14:30,099
performance of the plants that we're

418
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:31,719
using we want to improve the

419
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:33,220
bioavailability of the protein that

420
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:34,689
we're extracting we probably want to

421
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:36,459
improve the concentration of the protein

422
00:14:34,688 --> 00:14:39,368
in that plant and we also want to do

423
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:41,469
that in a way that decreases cost so of

424
00:14:39,369 --> 00:14:43,240
the projects that we support at these

425
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:45,699
various universities one of the ones

426
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:47,019
that's focus specifically on that that's

427
00:14:45,698 --> 00:14:49,479
this one at Clemson University of this

428
00:14:47,019 --> 00:14:51,490
characterizing field pea and sorghum

429
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:52,688
crops to try and improve the protein

430
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:55,959
content of them and improve the

431
00:14:52,688 --> 00:14:56,769
nutrition for my based meat this is kind

432
00:14:55,958 --> 00:14:58,088
of one of the first studies where

433
00:14:56,769 --> 00:15:01,659
they're specifically selecting and

434
00:14:58,089 --> 00:15:03,309
optimizing cultivars for protein extra

435
00:15:01,659 --> 00:15:06,419
for protein extraction for plant-based

436
00:15:03,308 --> 00:15:09,249
meat and for protein by a fortification

437
00:15:06,419 --> 00:15:10,509
another one is looking at quinoa as a

438
00:15:09,249 --> 00:15:11,678
raw material for plant-based meat

439
00:15:10,509 --> 00:15:14,289
products trying to characterize and

440
00:15:11,678 --> 00:15:17,879
optimize existing quinoa varieties and

441
00:15:14,289 --> 00:15:17,879
optimize protein extraction methods

442
00:15:18,269 --> 00:15:22,539
products so quinoa is cultivated around

443
00:15:21,068 --> 00:15:24,278
the globe and it's considered to be

444
00:15:22,539 --> 00:15:27,248
pretty resistant to abiotic about

445
00:15:24,278 --> 00:15:29,019
expresses the average grain yield for

446
00:15:27,249 --> 00:15:30,189
quinoa is two and a half to three and

447
00:15:29,019 --> 00:15:32,500
half tonnes per hectare and then in the

448
00:15:30,188 --> 00:15:33,879
last ten years this group have

449
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:35,169
conducted experiments to cultivate

450
00:15:33,879 --> 00:15:36,759
quinoa in Israel and they've increased

451
00:15:35,169 --> 00:15:38,019
that to an average grain yield of six

452
00:15:36,759 --> 00:15:40,659
tonnes per hectare say thinking that

453
00:15:38,019 --> 00:15:42,730
quinoa might be a more sustainable crop

454
00:15:40,659 --> 00:15:44,850
in Israel than in other areas where it's

455
00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:47,019
grown commercially valuable there

456
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:48,580
they're going to try to evaluate quinoa

457
00:15:47,019 --> 00:15:51,579
as a sustainable source of protein

458
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:52,930
itself picking seeds from high yielding

459
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:54,970
quinoa accessions and characterizing

460
00:15:52,929 --> 00:15:57,250
them for protein content content fiber

461
00:15:54,970 --> 00:15:58,750
content looking at different extraction

462
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:59,769
methods to prepare the protein

463
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:03,070
concentrates

464
00:15:59,769 --> 00:16:06,490
isolates fiber and defatted quinoa flour

465
00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:07,690
from these in the raw materials that's

466
00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:09,730
one of the projects in Israel there's

467
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:12,310
another company that we work with that's

468
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:13,420
an Israeli company economic rock reading

469
00:16:12,309 --> 00:16:16,239
and strain development to improve

470
00:16:13,419 --> 00:16:17,500
multiple traits simultaneously they were

471
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,850
founded six years ago to kind of a

472
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:22,299
breeding and seed development company

473
00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:24,790
and what they're trying to look at is

474
00:16:22,299 --> 00:16:27,429
ways of increasing protein concentration

475
00:16:24,789 --> 00:16:29,860
in these plants as well as other things

476
00:16:27,429 --> 00:16:33,459
like color and taste and amino acid

477
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:35,379
composition simultaneously so they've

478
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:37,629
done that with yellow pea in about three

479
00:16:35,379 --> 00:16:39,309
years they increased the amount of

480
00:16:37,629 --> 00:16:40,570
protein in the yellow peas during their

481
00:16:39,309 --> 00:16:42,639
working with from sixteen to twenty

482
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:44,680
percent to twenty to thirty percent and

483
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:48,569
the seed they also have projects with

484
00:16:44,679 --> 00:16:50,739
cowpea fava bean mung bean lentil quinoa

485
00:16:48,570 --> 00:16:53,950
with the university that are funding it

486
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:55,419
in israel chickpea and sesame so they'll

487
00:16:53,950 --> 00:16:57,670
just they'll collect as many kind of

488
00:16:55,419 --> 00:16:59,559
cultivars and variants varieties as they

489
00:16:57,669 --> 00:17:01,449
can you know type in phenotype them

490
00:16:59,559 --> 00:17:03,219
algorithmically just simulate all the

491
00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:05,830
potential crosses that they could do

492
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:06,850
with these varieties make those crosses

493
00:17:05,829 --> 00:17:08,859
and then with kind of two or three

494
00:17:06,849 --> 00:17:10,389
cycles per year look at which end up

495
00:17:08,859 --> 00:17:13,659
having in this case higher protein

496
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:15,730
concentrations or better taste better

497
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:18,040
amino acid composition and iteratively

498
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:20,289
narrowing on which are going to be the

499
00:17:18,039 --> 00:17:22,950
best process for in this case for

500
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:25,690
protein composition so it's not

501
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:28,210
particularly directed they're kind of

502
00:17:25,690 --> 00:17:30,160
trying to make this entire field like a

503
00:17:28,210 --> 00:17:31,029
matrix of all the potential across --is

504
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:33,009
that they can make with all the

505
00:17:31,029 --> 00:17:34,779
varieties are available part the reason

506
00:17:33,009 --> 00:17:36,670
for that is that some of the crops that

507
00:17:34,779 --> 00:17:38,500
they're working with are poorly

508
00:17:36,670 --> 00:17:40,120
characterized in terms of what improves

509
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:41,349
protein concentration and their jobs

510
00:17:40,119 --> 00:17:44,379
trying to do this in a relatively short

511
00:17:41,349 --> 00:17:45,730
timeframe so based on the success with

512
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:46,310
yellow pea we're working on them to try

513
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:48,049
to increase

514
00:17:46,309 --> 00:17:49,639
protein concentrations and some of these

515
00:17:48,049 --> 00:17:51,680
other varieties with hope that if we can

516
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:53,570
get the protein concentration in some of

517
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:57,230
these varieties up to the same level as

518
00:17:53,569 --> 00:17:59,689
we see protein in in soybean for example

519
00:17:57,230 --> 00:18:04,940
or in rice and wheat then we can start

520
00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:06,049
to transition some of the use of soy so

521
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:09,019
these are some of the protein sources

522
00:18:06,049 --> 00:18:10,819
that we look at with in terms of beauty

523
00:18:09,019 --> 00:18:13,789
caste for in terms of functionality for

524
00:18:10,819 --> 00:18:16,099
example do they extrude well are they

525
00:18:13,789 --> 00:18:21,109
something that can be that has good like

526
00:18:16,099 --> 00:18:23,779
with ability that can make kind of can

527
00:18:21,109 --> 00:18:26,599
make good emulsification so starting

528
00:18:23,779 --> 00:18:29,210
with soy is kind of the benchmark Beauty

529
00:18:26,599 --> 00:18:31,039
caste level you know pea has a similar

530
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:34,720
beauty caste level one is pretty good an

531
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:36,889
extrusion um usually low allergenicity

532
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:40,579
sometimes non-gm which can be important

533
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:42,560
for entering European markets protein

534
00:18:40,579 --> 00:18:44,539
from canola from grapes use actually

535
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:46,099
very good but it has limited

536
00:18:44,539 --> 00:18:49,609
availability in terms of getting protein

537
00:18:46,099 --> 00:18:50,659
isolate other pulses have lower Beauty

538
00:18:49,609 --> 00:18:54,829
categories but can be in some cases

539
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:56,710
combined to reach the point of soy we're

540
00:18:54,829 --> 00:18:58,879
looking into into hemp protein as well

541
00:18:56,710 --> 00:19:00,069
sunflower protein powders that can reach

542
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:02,870
up to 50 percent protein

543
00:19:00,069 --> 00:19:04,460
corn and oats that are usually lower

544
00:19:02,869 --> 00:19:06,559
lower nutritional quality at lower

545
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:07,819
protein concentrations there's one that

546
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:10,700
I like because they have chosen the name

547
00:19:07,819 --> 00:19:12,409
for o team just very clever of them and

548
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:18,289
that's a fifty percent protein

549
00:19:12,410 --> 00:19:20,509
concentration that's mostly used in so

550
00:19:18,289 --> 00:19:21,829
we're looking into a kind of other

551
00:19:20,509 --> 00:19:23,990
sources of protein with the idea that

552
00:19:21,829 --> 00:19:25,909
we've only looked at maybe eight percent

553
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:27,319
of the total available crops it could be

554
00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:28,850
used for plant protein and so we don't

555
00:19:27,319 --> 00:19:30,200
know for certain that those eight

556
00:19:28,849 --> 00:19:31,519
percent that we've looked at and

557
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:33,620
characterized are going to be the best

558
00:19:31,519 --> 00:19:35,359
in terms of mimicking either a

559
00:19:33,619 --> 00:19:37,669
nutritional functions of animal protein

560
00:19:35,359 --> 00:19:39,919
or the structure and formulations of

561
00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:41,750
animal protein products so some of the

562
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:43,610
other kind of underutilized or neglected

563
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:45,259
crops that we're looking at for sources

564
00:19:43,609 --> 00:19:48,129
of plant-based protein just based on the

565
00:19:45,259 --> 00:19:51,140
protein content of the mind itself

566
00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:52,990
winged bean protein has about thirty

567
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:54,650
five percent protein in the seeds

568
00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:56,329
lentils about twenty five percent

569
00:19:54,650 --> 00:19:57,650
protein by mass and they also have very

570
00:19:56,329 --> 00:19:59,599
good gelling and emulsification

571
00:19:57,650 --> 00:20:01,730
properties drive

572
00:19:59,599 --> 00:20:04,548
being 25% protein good with ability good

573
00:20:01,730 --> 00:20:06,319
foam stability dry cow pee these have up

574
00:20:04,548 --> 00:20:08,839
to 25% protein in these form good

575
00:20:06,319 --> 00:20:10,849
emulsions lupins have high protein

576
00:20:08,839 --> 00:20:12,439
content as well and they have favorable

577
00:20:10,849 --> 00:20:14,149
properties compared to sleeping so may

578
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:15,259
be able to replace some of the soy

579
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:17,900
protein in products that we're using

580
00:20:15,259 --> 00:20:21,169
with Lupin protein some others that have

581
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:22,788
been characterized less well Bambara

582
00:20:21,169 --> 00:20:25,009
beans have a relatively high protein

583
00:20:22,788 --> 00:20:26,599
content dulse which is this kind of red

584
00:20:25,009 --> 00:20:28,460
seaweed I'm gonna talk about a project

585
00:20:26,599 --> 00:20:30,949
that studies red algae that can have

586
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:33,288
between 9 and 25% protein by dry weight

587
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:35,890
but is one of the main kind of

588
00:20:33,288 --> 00:20:39,288
aquaculture sources of plant protein um

589
00:20:35,890 --> 00:20:41,210
mesquite beans and then duck weed which

590
00:20:39,288 --> 00:20:42,859
is traditionally consumed as a

591
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:45,220
high-protein food source has a higher

592
00:20:42,859 --> 00:20:47,449
protein content than soy beans but

593
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:50,630
doesn't have very good characterization

594
00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:53,058
of its functional properties so we're

595
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:54,460
trying to fund research into extracting

596
00:20:53,058 --> 00:20:57,069
protein from duck weed and looking at

597
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:59,630
functionalisation out of that as well

598
00:20:57,069 --> 00:21:01,099
one of the projects that were funding in

599
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:03,559
the US with this company called trophic

600
00:21:01,099 --> 00:21:06,649
is looking at deriving protein from red

601
00:21:03,558 --> 00:21:07,908
seaweed from macro algae so the supply

602
00:21:06,650 --> 00:21:09,919
chain for red seaweed right now there's

603
00:21:07,909 --> 00:21:12,919
about 18 million tons produced and has

604
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:14,870
up to 45% protein in the plants we think

605
00:21:12,919 --> 00:21:16,130
that would be a good candidate for plant

606
00:21:14,869 --> 00:21:18,079
protein products as well as because it

607
00:21:16,130 --> 00:21:20,659
has this kind of umami like flavor

608
00:21:18,079 --> 00:21:24,048
profile and because it's red and so

609
00:21:20,659 --> 00:21:26,450
people expect sometimes expect like beef

610
00:21:24,048 --> 00:21:28,158
or other kind of meat products to have

611
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:30,980
that coloring and so being able to have

612
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:33,980
that in the client itself as a secondary

613
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:36,409
extract the key challenge here is

614
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:39,288
developing an extraction process for

615
00:21:36,409 --> 00:21:41,570
extracting the protein from doles that

616
00:21:39,288 --> 00:21:42,798
meets cost and quality targets so this

617
00:21:41,569 --> 00:21:45,349
group is trying to optimize their

618
00:21:42,798 --> 00:21:47,509
protein extraction processes to meet the

619
00:21:45,349 --> 00:21:49,038
quality specifications of some of the

620
00:21:47,509 --> 00:21:51,710
secondary companies that want to make

621
00:21:49,038 --> 00:21:55,000
based protein products out of these

622
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:56,470
seaweeds we also look at

623
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,789
other types of non animal cell culture

624
00:21:56,470 --> 00:22:00,339
so I won't talk about here but we're

625
00:21:57,789 --> 00:22:02,289
also looking at using bacterial proteins

626
00:22:00,339 --> 00:22:05,009
for micro proteins sometimes in

627
00:22:02,289 --> 00:22:07,629
conjunction with my base proteins as

628
00:22:05,009 --> 00:22:10,379
natural sources both of a protein itself

629
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:13,270
and of flavorings stabilizers pigments

630
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:14,560
so most of the projects that were

631
00:22:13,269 --> 00:22:16,900
funding in this area have the aim of

632
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:19,119
improving the nutritional profile of

633
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:20,230
crops in plant-based meats either using

634
00:22:19,119 --> 00:22:21,609
selective breeding or genetic

635
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:23,349
modification to breed mice with higher

636
00:22:21,609 --> 00:22:27,099
nutrient levels or higher protein levels

637
00:22:23,349 --> 00:22:29,319
so we can get protein extracts more

638
00:22:27,099 --> 00:22:32,019
easily get higher quality protein

639
00:22:29,319 --> 00:22:34,839
extracts either for dietary supplements

640
00:22:32,019 --> 00:22:36,639
or plant-based meat another project that

641
00:22:34,839 --> 00:22:38,949
we funded with the foundation for food

642
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:40,840
agriculture and the open flan 3 project

643
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:43,630
is trying to optimize the use of pulses

644
00:22:40,839 --> 00:22:44,980
based meat so along with identifying new

645
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:47,140
or underutilized sources of crops that

646
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:48,819
we can use we can also optimize crops

647
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:50,770
that are currently it used to be better

648
00:22:48,819 --> 00:22:52,029
for my face need to increase the amount

649
00:22:50,769 --> 00:22:55,150
of protein in them we're doing boosts

650
00:22:52,029 --> 00:22:56,470
the bioavailability of them this project

651
00:22:55,150 --> 00:22:57,280
is characterizing the texturization

652
00:22:56,470 --> 00:22:59,519
abilities and molecular

653
00:22:57,279 --> 00:23:01,359
characterizations of pulse proteins

654
00:22:59,519 --> 00:23:02,769
including where they bind other

655
00:23:01,359 --> 00:23:04,589
molecules like flavor agents how they

656
00:23:02,769 --> 00:23:06,549
unfold during the cooking process and

657
00:23:04,589 --> 00:23:08,889
computationally which genes can be added

658
00:23:06,549 --> 00:23:11,559
or edited you needs to produce varieties

659
00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:14,880
improved in this area um this is too

660
00:23:11,559 --> 00:23:17,349
many words on one slide basically the

661
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:18,430
research process were in phase 1 the

662
00:23:17,349 --> 00:23:20,529
using high-throughput digital

663
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:22,000
phenotyping and sequencing to

664
00:23:20,529 --> 00:23:23,920
functionally characterize a variety of

665
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,869
pulses with a focus on Galatian

666
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:28,769
water-holding capacity and fat binding

667
00:23:25,869 --> 00:23:32,379
ability which are important for making

668
00:23:28,769 --> 00:23:33,639
my based burger or product that's going

669
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:35,560
to be a kind of a mixture of this

670
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:37,750
protein slurry and some kind of

671
00:23:35,559 --> 00:23:39,519
plant-based fat and they're also looking

672
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:41,259
at the structuring ability of proteins

673
00:23:39,519 --> 00:23:43,690
from pulses or in these ingredient

674
00:23:41,259 --> 00:23:47,349
combinations to form a fibrous structure

675
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:49,600
that looks more like it more like tissue

676
00:23:47,349 --> 00:23:52,029
that would kind of have this meat like

677
00:23:49,599 --> 00:23:53,409
appearance and texture so all of this is

678
00:23:52,029 --> 00:23:55,180
going to be publicly available online so

679
00:23:53,410 --> 00:23:57,670
that in the second phase they can use

680
00:23:55,180 --> 00:24:00,070
that data to perform breeding to improve

681
00:23:57,670 --> 00:24:00,880
pulse crops for the explicit purpose of

682
00:24:00,069 --> 00:24:03,419
making these crops

683
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:05,320
better based meat ingredients

684
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:07,060
cultivating them for that based meat

685
00:24:05,319 --> 00:24:08,439
applicant obligations so there's an

686
00:24:07,059 --> 00:24:09,379
entire pulse

687
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:10,910
Council

688
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:11,900
that is supporting this and the things

689
00:24:10,910 --> 00:24:14,450
that one of the ways that they can

690
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:16,160
improve the market for pulses is by

691
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:19,279
selling to kind of a growing plant-based

692
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:21,950
meat market this exemplifies some of the

693
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:24,859
ways that we're trying to make data

694
00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:26,900
collection and analysis available to

695
00:24:24,859 --> 00:24:29,389
researchers more broadly us that we can

696
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:31,370
have kind of a database of what crops

697
00:24:29,390 --> 00:24:33,080
are best for plant-based meat which

698
00:24:31,369 --> 00:24:35,959
genotypic and phenotypic characteristics

699
00:24:33,079 --> 00:24:37,429
lead to higher protein high protein

700
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:39,680
expression levels so that people can

701
00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:40,910
then go on and do studies based on that

702
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:42,740
where they're trying to optimize other

703
00:24:40,910 --> 00:24:44,450
maybe crops or other plants that we

704
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:46,370
haven't identified as potential sources

705
00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:47,870
of land-based meat or do something

706
00:24:46,369 --> 00:24:49,729
studies were talking about like with

707
00:24:47,869 --> 00:24:52,279
soil condition to see which

708
00:24:49,730 --> 00:24:53,809
characteristics and improve the

709
00:24:52,279 --> 00:24:57,049
bioavailability of the proteins in these

710
00:24:53,809 --> 00:24:58,220
crops one another of the projects that

711
00:24:57,049 --> 00:25:00,200
we're funding that's kind of similar to

712
00:24:58,220 --> 00:25:03,440
that is looking at fermentation of oat

713
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:05,960
protein application analog so

714
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:09,769
fermentation can improve the flavor of

715
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:10,700
protein it can produce additional lysine

716
00:25:09,769 --> 00:25:13,549
which is one of the problems with

717
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:16,789
protein as it has a limited amount of

718
00:25:13,549 --> 00:25:18,379
lysine that reduces its PD cows for both

719
00:25:16,789 --> 00:25:20,779
protein also has some anti nutrients

720
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:22,270
some lectins and saponins that can be

721
00:25:20,779 --> 00:25:24,289
degraded through fermentation

722
00:25:22,269 --> 00:25:25,970
fermentation can produce exit

723
00:25:24,289 --> 00:25:27,920
polysaccharides that improve the texture

724
00:25:25,970 --> 00:25:29,569
of the oat protein and it can increase

725
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:32,750
overall nutritional value so this group

726
00:25:29,569 --> 00:25:34,220
in estonia is looking at exploring how

727
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:36,380
fermentation can affect the quality of

728
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:39,610
oat protein and make a better oat

729
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:39,610
protein in terms of flavor

730
00:25:39,730 --> 00:25:43,220
other ways that we can increase protein

731
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:45,140
yield and so this was not research that

732
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:46,400
we funded this was just a paper that we

733
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:47,810
thought was interesting and exemplifies

734
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:49,880
some of the ways that we can improve

735
00:25:47,809 --> 00:25:51,710
protein yield not just through targeting

736
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:54,280
protein itself but also targeting client

737
00:25:51,710 --> 00:25:57,259
growth and so this project was trying to

738
00:25:54,279 --> 00:26:01,609
improve photorespiration

739
00:25:57,259 --> 00:26:03,549
so that plants so that the main the

740
00:26:01,609 --> 00:26:06,439
primary process which is in gray

741
00:26:03,549 --> 00:26:08,059
involves the kind of expensive break

742
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:11,920
down like late in the they were trying

743
00:26:08,059 --> 00:26:14,509
to engineer other actually processing

744
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:16,100
mechanisms it would reduce kind of the

745
00:26:14,509 --> 00:26:17,720
time and the cost of the plant of doing

746
00:26:16,099 --> 00:26:20,119
that and they found that this greatly

747
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:21,950
increased growth of the plant though

748
00:26:20,119 --> 00:26:23,989
it's unclear whether that is passed on

749
00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:25,610
to subsequent generations

750
00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:27,529
the main idea here is that we are also

751
00:26:25,609 --> 00:26:30,769
looking for research projects that would

752
00:26:27,529 --> 00:26:32,480
improve yield of plant proteins in terms

753
00:26:30,769 --> 00:26:32,990
of increasing the size of rodent

754
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,460
research

755
00:26:32,990 --> 00:26:36,440
shortening the growing time as well and

756
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:39,009
not just increasing the protein

757
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:42,200
concentration in seeds and leaves

758
00:26:39,009 --> 00:26:43,490
so once we've then chosen a plant that

759
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,990
we want to use in a plant protein

760
00:26:43,490 --> 00:26:46,609
product and we need better methods to

761
00:26:44,990 --> 00:26:49,009
isolate and functionalize the raw

762
00:26:46,609 --> 00:26:50,779
materials for making punish me

763
00:26:49,009 --> 00:26:54,650
documentary better methods of protein

764
00:26:50,779 --> 00:26:56,349
fractionation or isolation isolation as

765
00:26:54,650 --> 00:26:58,460
well as enzymatic functionalisation

766
00:26:56,349 --> 00:27:01,669
biologically or chemically and

767
00:26:58,460 --> 00:27:03,140
hydrolysis so we can either look at

768
00:27:01,670 --> 00:27:04,519
chemically isolating the raw material

769
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:07,009
that we want to use we can look at using

770
00:27:04,519 --> 00:27:09,379
mechanical methods to separate the raw

771
00:27:07,009 --> 00:27:11,900
materials we can look at soaking and

772
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:13,190
using solvents milling or pounding to

773
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:15,350
isolate various components to the plants

774
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:16,880
using enzymes and extruders to

775
00:27:15,349 --> 00:27:18,079
restructure the plant proteins that they

776
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:19,310
exhibit some of the same functional

777
00:27:18,079 --> 00:27:21,349
properties that we want in animal

778
00:27:19,309 --> 00:27:22,909
proteins and many of these can be

779
00:27:21,349 --> 00:27:25,129
optimized for plant-based meat raw

780
00:27:22,910 --> 00:27:29,330
materials to improve digestibility

781
00:27:25,130 --> 00:27:30,980
texture when we talk about what type of

782
00:27:29,329 --> 00:27:32,509
plant protein we want to use in some

783
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:34,370
cases we want to use protein flour in

784
00:27:32,509 --> 00:27:36,920
some cases protein concentrated protein

785
00:27:34,369 --> 00:27:38,479
isolate these vary based on protein

786
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:42,230
contents and based on how they're

787
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:44,420
fractionated what kind of use so the

788
00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:47,779
process by which soy protein is produced

789
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:49,940
from soybeans can kick out either so

790
00:27:47,779 --> 00:27:51,549
flour soy protein concentrate or soy

791
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:53,809
protein isolate at these different steps

792
00:27:51,549 --> 00:27:56,509
the soybeans themselves are cracked and

793
00:27:53,809 --> 00:27:59,059
behold the holes that can be used as a

794
00:27:56,509 --> 00:28:00,170
product themselves as a few probably

795
00:27:59,059 --> 00:28:01,819
themselves when they're flakes and then

796
00:28:00,170 --> 00:28:03,440
you can get soy oil from that and so

797
00:28:01,819 --> 00:28:05,240
there's kind of a multi-step process

798
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:07,250
depending on what concentration of

799
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:10,970
protein you want to get from the soybean

800
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:12,309
and then similarly in wheat a multi-step

801
00:28:10,970 --> 00:28:14,420
process depending on whether you want

802
00:28:12,309 --> 00:28:16,159
quite a wheat gluten in your products

803
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:18,320
whether you want textured wheat protein

804
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:20,779
isolated wheat protein and what kind of

805
00:28:18,319 --> 00:28:22,789
concentration of wheat protein what so

806
00:28:20,779 --> 00:28:25,279
optimizing this process and looking at

807
00:28:22,789 --> 00:28:27,200
other types of extrusion methods that

808
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:28,879
can either involve lower temperatures or

809
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:33,319
they involve higher pressure instead of

810
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:34,940
asthmatic extrusion or hydrolysis could

811
00:28:33,319 --> 00:28:36,298
improve the texture and can improve the

812
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:39,389
functionality of

813
00:28:36,298 --> 00:28:40,950
the results on protein um high-pressure

814
00:28:39,388 --> 00:28:42,658
huh modernization in particular we're

815
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:44,519
looking at because we know that taste is

816
00:28:42,659 --> 00:28:46,019
better in products that have a higher

817
00:28:44,519 --> 00:28:47,788
protein concentration but we're not

818
00:28:46,019 --> 00:28:49,138
entirely sure whether that's because the

819
00:28:47,788 --> 00:28:50,759
processing steps that are used to

820
00:28:49,138 --> 00:28:52,498
improve that he's going to fraction

821
00:28:50,759 --> 00:28:54,690
eight out the plant protein involve

822
00:28:52,499 --> 00:28:57,629
higher heat so we're looking at whether

823
00:28:54,690 --> 00:28:59,249
higher pressure can end up with a high

824
00:28:57,628 --> 00:29:02,668
concentration protein product that has

825
00:28:59,249 --> 00:29:05,149
the same kind of lack of taste it

826
00:29:02,669 --> 00:29:07,889
doesn't involve that heat treatment step

827
00:29:05,148 --> 00:29:09,988
from there we want to make a formulation

828
00:29:07,888 --> 00:29:12,418
from this plant protein product and that

829
00:29:09,989 --> 00:29:14,629
involves adding binders adding

830
00:29:12,419 --> 00:29:16,799
flavorings adding plant-based fats

831
00:29:14,628 --> 00:29:18,808
cements adding other ingredients that

832
00:29:16,798 --> 00:29:23,128
will improve the taste or smell of the

833
00:29:18,808 --> 00:29:25,229
product so in terms of recapitulating

834
00:29:23,128 --> 00:29:26,368
the experience of cooking when we're

835
00:29:25,229 --> 00:29:30,119
looking at additives that are going to

836
00:29:26,368 --> 00:29:32,218
be flavor and fragrance additives we

837
00:29:30,118 --> 00:29:34,078
need something that's going to be stable

838
00:29:32,219 --> 00:29:37,940
throughout the cooking process and that

839
00:29:34,078 --> 00:29:40,678
was also going to retain that same

840
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:42,869
flavor and a fragrance profile from a

841
00:29:40,679 --> 00:29:44,909
raw product through a cooked product so

842
00:29:42,868 --> 00:29:47,128
one of the reasons why impossible foods

843
00:29:44,909 --> 00:29:48,599
decided to launch their burger in

844
00:29:47,128 --> 00:29:50,038
restaurants first was because they could

845
00:29:48,598 --> 00:29:51,658
then kind of control the way that the

846
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:53,368
end product was presented to consumers

847
00:29:51,659 --> 00:29:55,919
and the beyond burger being available in

848
00:29:53,368 --> 00:29:56,968
grocery stores you can take it home and

849
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:58,469
open it and a lot of people complain

850
00:29:56,969 --> 00:30:02,639
that it smells like cat food or that it

851
00:29:58,469 --> 00:30:05,849
has this kind of like off scent in its

852
00:30:02,638 --> 00:30:07,199
raw or natural form so there's a course

853
00:30:05,848 --> 00:30:09,019
at Berkeley that I advise and we work

854
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:11,729
with Shiva down on developing new

855
00:30:09,019 --> 00:30:13,499
flavoring agents for that base meat

856
00:30:11,729 --> 00:30:14,819
products and some of the interesting

857
00:30:13,499 --> 00:30:16,979
things we find it at some of the

858
00:30:14,819 --> 00:30:19,678
molecules that were looking at like

859
00:30:16,979 --> 00:30:21,869
there's one two methyl five butylene

860
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:23,369
that smells like citrus at low

861
00:30:21,868 --> 00:30:24,928
concentrations and smells like chicken

862
00:30:23,368 --> 00:30:26,939
at high concentrations and the idea is

863
00:30:24,929 --> 00:30:28,349
how can we control the concentration

864
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:29,729
profile of this chemical when we're

865
00:30:28,348 --> 00:30:31,048
adding it to a formulation that people

866
00:30:29,729 --> 00:30:34,798
are then going to cook at home or make

867
00:30:31,048 --> 00:30:37,408
into he falls at home another main

868
00:30:34,798 --> 00:30:39,058
component of optimizing flavor is adding

869
00:30:37,409 --> 00:30:40,259
so we'll talk about heme in terms of the

870
00:30:39,058 --> 00:30:42,418
impossible burger and how they've used

871
00:30:40,259 --> 00:30:46,069
soy like hemoglobin to recreate that

872
00:30:42,419 --> 00:30:48,160
kind of irony taste of the bloody

873
00:30:46,069 --> 00:30:50,950
components of meat

874
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:52,420
flavor also involves adding fat and so

875
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:54,250
one of the projects that we're funding

876
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:56,320
at Berkeley involves encapsulating

877
00:30:54,250 --> 00:30:58,359
sunflower oil in a commercially

878
00:30:56,319 --> 00:30:59,950
available Sapan in and then planful

879
00:30:58,359 --> 00:31:03,429
izing freeze drying that's but it can be

880
00:30:59,950 --> 00:31:06,610
used as a shelf stable additives and new

881
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:08,019
formulation you can have oil that you

882
00:31:06,609 --> 00:31:09,609
want it to be encapsulate encapsulated

883
00:31:08,019 --> 00:31:12,490
in some way because you want it to

884
00:31:09,609 --> 00:31:13,779
retain its position within the overall

885
00:31:12,490 --> 00:31:17,069
kind of structure the product through

886
00:31:13,779 --> 00:31:21,430
the cooking process so ground beef has

887
00:31:17,069 --> 00:31:22,839
40 different types of fats that have

888
00:31:21,430 --> 00:31:24,850
different melting points and different

889
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:26,709
levels of saturation and so throughout

890
00:31:24,849 --> 00:31:27,969
the cooking process they'll melt at

891
00:31:26,710 --> 00:31:29,410
different stages some of them will

892
00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:30,730
remain solid at the end of the cooking

893
00:31:29,410 --> 00:31:32,170
process some of them melts the very

894
00:31:30,730 --> 00:31:33,819
beginning when you're adding a

895
00:31:32,170 --> 00:31:35,890
plant-based fat you're pretty much

896
00:31:33,819 --> 00:31:37,839
adding one type of fat molecule you're

897
00:31:35,890 --> 00:31:39,160
adding you know sunflower oil you're

898
00:31:37,839 --> 00:31:41,079
adding palm oil something and that has a

899
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:44,019
particular melting point so it's one of

900
00:31:41,079 --> 00:31:45,909
the challenges is finding ways of of

901
00:31:44,019 --> 00:31:48,039
encapsulating that fat such that it will

902
00:31:45,910 --> 00:31:49,690
remain solid throughout the cooking

903
00:31:48,039 --> 00:31:51,639
process it doesn't immediately just leak

904
00:31:49,690 --> 00:31:53,769
out and you end up with a very dry my

905
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:56,710
face burger um

906
00:31:53,769 --> 00:31:58,450
flavor kind of all flavors in plant

907
00:31:56,710 --> 00:31:59,950
proteins are one of the main problems

908
00:31:58,450 --> 00:32:01,539
for my based meat as well so we have a

909
00:31:59,950 --> 00:32:03,009
project that we're funding in China it's

910
00:32:01,539 --> 00:32:04,569
trying to identify what molecules are

911
00:32:03,009 --> 00:32:06,430
responsible for these kinds of beanie

912
00:32:04,569 --> 00:32:09,279
off flavors better present and key

913
00:32:06,430 --> 00:32:11,440
protein to identify which volatile

914
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:12,700
compounds contribute to that beanie off

915
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:16,480
flavor and then figure out ways of

916
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:19,269
removing moving those compounds so this

917
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:21,460
is primarily a project that's using GC

918
00:32:19,269 --> 00:32:23,019
mass spec to first identify which

919
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:24,910
volatiles are contributing to that off

920
00:32:23,019 --> 00:32:26,379
flavor and then see if they're easy ways

921
00:32:24,910 --> 00:32:30,550
of extracting that through the process

922
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:32,670
of producing P pretty nicely some of the

923
00:32:30,549 --> 00:32:36,639
other technical obstacles to formulation

924
00:32:32,670 --> 00:32:38,890
include that in muscle phosphates can

925
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:40,509
draw protein from the meat matrix or

926
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:42,310
from the muscle to the surface and that

927
00:32:40,509 --> 00:32:45,129
can create kind of stickiness and help

928
00:32:42,309 --> 00:32:47,440
with forming a coating on top of the of

929
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:49,210
the meat product as it's cooking we're

930
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:50,529
not sure if just adding phosphates to

931
00:32:49,210 --> 00:32:51,490
plant-based meats is going to do is

932
00:32:50,529 --> 00:32:53,410
going to have the same functional

933
00:32:51,490 --> 00:32:55,059
properties a lot of times we add

934
00:32:53,410 --> 00:32:57,130
starches to find basement products as

935
00:32:55,059 --> 00:32:59,529
binders that can affect the mouthfeel of

936
00:32:57,130 --> 00:33:01,270
the products and then we need to combine

937
00:32:59,529 --> 00:33:01,809
them with fiber in order to have a

938
00:33:01,269 --> 00:33:03,039
better

939
00:33:01,809 --> 00:33:06,009
texture and better nutritional

940
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:07,029
properties fiber itself though absorbs

941
00:33:06,009 --> 00:33:08,920
water and so that can also affect

942
00:33:07,029 --> 00:33:11,740
mouthfeel even though it's an effective

943
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:13,570
texture replacer for fat you don't wanna

944
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:16,120
have to high of a fiber concentration in

945
00:33:13,569 --> 00:33:19,059
your products because then that leads to

946
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:21,959
more water absorbing product than you

947
00:33:19,059 --> 00:33:24,159
may want so we can't fully replace

948
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:25,059
starch with fiber in the product you

949
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:27,460
have to figure out the optimal

950
00:33:25,059 --> 00:33:28,509
combination of starches and fibers and

951
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:30,400
proteins they're going to make something

952
00:33:28,509 --> 00:33:31,990
that has the same kind of bite and

953
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:34,630
chewiness of whatever meat product

954
00:33:31,990 --> 00:33:36,940
you're trying to replicate the next step

955
00:33:34,630 --> 00:33:40,480
then is manufacturing so taking this

956
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:42,250
mixture a probably plant protein some

957
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:44,079
kind of fats and flavorings and binder

958
00:33:42,250 --> 00:33:45,569
and taking that slurry and processing it

959
00:33:44,079 --> 00:33:49,029
and so that can include extrusion

960
00:33:45,569 --> 00:33:52,240
molding dehydration shear cells fiber

961
00:33:49,029 --> 00:33:53,829
spinning 3d printing as well as

962
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:56,500
developing the sensing technology so

963
00:33:53,829 --> 00:33:58,720
that we can determine at which point in

964
00:33:56,500 --> 00:34:00,339
for example an extrusion process we're

965
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:01,240
getting the right texture and under what

966
00:34:00,339 --> 00:34:03,609
conditions we're getting the right

967
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:04,390
texture so a lot of plant-based mu is

968
00:34:03,609 --> 00:34:06,909
produced through high moisture

969
00:34:04,390 --> 00:34:08,260
twin-screw extrusion so this is kind of

970
00:34:06,910 --> 00:34:09,639
a machine it would be about like the

971
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:11,800
size of something you'd put on a factory

972
00:34:09,639 --> 00:34:13,480
floor like sometimes I put a person here

973
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:17,769
to show you that it's not like bench

974
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:19,210
scale kind of factory scale extrusion so

975
00:34:17,769 --> 00:34:21,550
we put that premix kind of protein

976
00:34:19,210 --> 00:34:24,820
slurry into a theater and then there are

977
00:34:21,550 --> 00:34:28,060
co-rotating screws that are heated as

978
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:30,610
well so you can affect you can change

979
00:34:28,059 --> 00:34:33,279
what type of protein comes out both by

980
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:35,559
the final dye that cools the product and

981
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:39,820
kind of cuts it into shapes but also by

982
00:34:35,559 --> 00:34:41,230
the rate of rotation of those screws by

983
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:43,510
the temperature by the water

984
00:34:41,230 --> 00:34:45,280
concentration the idea here is that we

985
00:34:43,510 --> 00:34:47,140
want to produce a textured protein

986
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:49,060
similar to the way that v or spinning

987
00:34:47,139 --> 00:34:52,629
machines were originally used to create

988
00:34:49,059 --> 00:34:54,279
soy protein fibers we want to make soy

989
00:34:52,630 --> 00:34:56,530
beans or soy protein into products like

990
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:58,780
soy curls or its products like any of

991
00:34:56,530 --> 00:35:01,210
these variety of textures and shapes um

992
00:34:58,780 --> 00:35:03,550
they're all soy protein and what we're

993
00:35:01,210 --> 00:35:07,800
varying here is water content the dye

994
00:35:03,550 --> 00:35:09,400
and the temperature used to extrude them

995
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:10,750
one of the other

996
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:12,849
we're funding is developing real-time

997
00:35:10,750 --> 00:35:15,099
sensors for extrusion because we don't

998
00:35:12,849 --> 00:35:16,360
really know when problems develop during

999
00:35:15,099 --> 00:35:18,429
extrusion until they come out the other

1000
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:21,809
end of the ice this could be a project

1001
00:35:18,429 --> 00:35:24,730
that would help us improve the cost of

1002
00:35:21,809 --> 00:35:27,039
diagnosing problems with protein

1003
00:35:24,730 --> 00:35:30,309
extrusion and also monitoring throughout

1004
00:35:27,039 --> 00:35:34,179
the process through ultrasonic

1005
00:35:30,309 --> 00:35:36,849
ultrasonic sensing within the actual

1006
00:35:34,179 --> 00:35:38,469
twin-screw itself we can see when we're

1007
00:35:36,849 --> 00:35:41,739
getting a better shape or when we're

1008
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:43,659
getting better fiber structure um some

1009
00:35:41,739 --> 00:35:46,599
of what we do in order to help companies

1010
00:35:43,659 --> 00:35:47,980
develop these processes as well as you

1011
00:35:46,599 --> 00:35:50,739
kind of back to be on the ball

1012
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:53,949
calculations or like economic monitoring

1013
00:35:50,739 --> 00:35:55,719
of what the scale they would need to

1014
00:35:53,949 --> 00:35:59,409
produce would be if we want to meet

1015
00:35:55,719 --> 00:36:00,819
certain targets of selling to selling a

1016
00:35:59,409 --> 00:36:03,069
certain amount of plant-based meat or

1017
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:04,870
producing a certain amount um so if we

1018
00:36:03,070 --> 00:36:06,730
look at just time moisture twin-screw

1019
00:36:04,869 --> 00:36:08,409
extrusion we can look at how many

1020
00:36:06,730 --> 00:36:09,880
kilograms for our fund based meat can be

1021
00:36:08,409 --> 00:36:12,549
produced from the average extruder how

1022
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:14,349
long they're run if we think that maybe

1023
00:36:12,550 --> 00:36:16,269
we want 80% of plant-based meat products

1024
00:36:14,349 --> 00:36:18,099
on the market in 2020 to use extrusion

1025
00:36:16,269 --> 00:36:19,329
then we know about how many industrial

1026
00:36:18,099 --> 00:36:22,289
scale extruders we would need to have

1027
00:36:19,329 --> 00:36:22,289
operating globally

1028
00:36:22,679 --> 00:36:27,849
knowing about the number of extruders

1029
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:31,119
that are operating currently it's it's

1030
00:36:27,849 --> 00:36:32,920
fewer than 168 I think it's about 130 or

1031
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:35,289
so so we would need to scale up the

1032
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:37,750
number of extruders that are operating

1033
00:36:35,289 --> 00:36:39,639
one way we can do that is by encouraging

1034
00:36:37,750 --> 00:36:41,110
companies to have better monitoring so

1035
00:36:39,639 --> 00:36:42,699
that it's more economically feasible for

1036
00:36:41,110 --> 00:36:44,470
them to increase the amount of extrusion

1037
00:36:42,699 --> 00:36:47,169
that they're doing but another way is to

1038
00:36:44,469 --> 00:36:48,579
use other methods that are maybe gentler

1039
00:36:47,170 --> 00:36:51,099
that require lower temperatures in

1040
00:36:48,579 --> 00:36:52,299
extrusion so bargaining and university

1041
00:36:51,099 --> 00:36:53,739
and the Netherlands has developed

1042
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:55,240
something they were originally calling a

1043
00:36:53,739 --> 00:36:57,039
Collette cell another calling it a shear

1044
00:36:55,239 --> 00:36:58,179
cell it's kind of like an ice cream

1045
00:36:57,039 --> 00:37:00,610
maker in the sense that it has this

1046
00:36:58,179 --> 00:37:02,679
large rotating ring in the outside a

1047
00:37:00,610 --> 00:37:05,140
static ring on the inside and you put

1048
00:37:02,679 --> 00:37:07,989
your protein formulation in the kind of

1049
00:37:05,139 --> 00:37:11,259
barrel and the difference in rotation

1050
00:37:07,989 --> 00:37:14,679
between the outer rim of the outer

1051
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:16,870
rotating ring an inner static rim sets

1052
00:37:14,679 --> 00:37:18,549
up this shear gradient and that aligns

1053
00:37:16,869 --> 00:37:20,679
protein fibers in a way that helps the

1054
00:37:18,550 --> 00:37:22,630
mimic muscle fiber itself so this is

1055
00:37:20,679 --> 00:37:25,298
kind of what it looks like coming

1056
00:37:22,630 --> 00:37:26,890
out of the machine here are some

1057
00:37:25,298 --> 00:37:29,528
electron micrograph images of how the

1058
00:37:26,889 --> 00:37:33,639
protein ends up structured and this kind

1059
00:37:29,528 --> 00:37:35,108
of fibrous align sheets and here's what

1060
00:37:33,639 --> 00:37:36,568
something like the below image would

1061
00:37:35,108 --> 00:37:39,038
look like when cooked so it kind of

1062
00:37:36,568 --> 00:37:43,420
replicates the the texture and the

1063
00:37:39,039 --> 00:37:45,160
perception of fiber um in terms of these

1064
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:47,740
processing methods we also look at how

1065
00:37:45,159 --> 00:37:49,598
processing affects both the chewiness

1066
00:37:47,739 --> 00:37:51,209
you can imagine that as you're rotating

1067
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:53,619
and setting up this your gradient you're

1068
00:37:51,210 --> 00:37:56,139
mixing the protein more and maybe making

1069
00:37:53,619 --> 00:37:57,759
it should we're increasing insulation so

1070
00:37:56,139 --> 00:38:00,038
we look at how heat and pressure

1071
00:37:57,759 --> 00:38:02,579
throughout these processing steps

1072
00:38:00,039 --> 00:38:05,410
affects the hardness and the chewiness

1073
00:38:02,579 --> 00:38:07,539
in this case of rapeseed protein extract

1074
00:38:05,409 --> 00:38:09,879
so that we can target something that

1075
00:38:07,539 --> 00:38:11,970
most model more closely mimics an animal

1076
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:14,559
protein that we're looking to replicate

1077
00:38:11,969 --> 00:38:16,028
there's also a company called Nova meat

1078
00:38:14,559 --> 00:38:18,099
that's looking into 3d printing as an

1079
00:38:16,028 --> 00:38:20,349
alternative to extrusion so it can use

1080
00:38:18,099 --> 00:38:22,539
an ink that's a paste of rice protein

1081
00:38:20,349 --> 00:38:23,890
pea protein and seaweed so you can add

1082
00:38:22,539 --> 00:38:25,420
colors and flavors and obviously this is

1083
00:38:23,889 --> 00:38:27,670
not something that's going to scale up

1084
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:29,559
to meet you know the entire demand of

1085
00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:31,269
plant-based protein that we have but you

1086
00:38:29,559 --> 00:38:32,740
can produce custom-designed shapes and

1087
00:38:31,268 --> 00:38:34,239
so it's an alternative to extrusion if

1088
00:38:32,739 --> 00:38:39,518
you want to make something that is a

1089
00:38:34,239 --> 00:38:40,750
very particular shape or size so one of

1090
00:38:39,518 --> 00:38:42,969
the projects that were funding that's

1091
00:38:40,750 --> 00:38:45,670
looking at texture is looking at

1092
00:38:42,969 --> 00:38:47,018
creating different meat like textures by

1093
00:38:45,670 --> 00:38:49,568
a combination of microstructure

1094
00:38:47,018 --> 00:38:51,729
engineering and high meister extrusion a

1095
00:38:49,568 --> 00:38:53,858
day here is that they would form kind of

1096
00:38:51,730 --> 00:38:56,588
a plant protein matrix it's one type of

1097
00:38:53,858 --> 00:38:58,028
protein and then precipitate a second

1098
00:38:56,588 --> 00:39:00,639
protein over that so like a pea protein

1099
00:38:58,028 --> 00:39:02,650
precipitated over a week or over a soy

1100
00:39:00,639 --> 00:39:04,568
protein structure the idea is that this

1101
00:39:02,650 --> 00:39:05,798
would help form a fiber like structure

1102
00:39:04,568 --> 00:39:07,690
that's more similar to me then that's

1103
00:39:05,798 --> 00:39:09,940
kind of a fiber reinforced polymer

1104
00:39:07,690 --> 00:39:12,730
network with a fiber filler in this

1105
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:15,338
matrix and then yeah their idea is that

1106
00:39:12,730 --> 00:39:18,190
different meats have different fibrous

1107
00:39:15,338 --> 00:39:20,469
textures and so they can better target a

1108
00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:22,210
texture that mimics fish with it mimics

1109
00:39:20,469 --> 00:39:29,889
beef or chicken through this

1110
00:39:22,210 --> 00:39:31,179
precipitation process of what proteins

1111
00:39:29,889 --> 00:39:32,259
are used currently then when we're

1112
00:39:31,179 --> 00:39:33,699
talking about the impossible burger in

1113
00:39:32,259 --> 00:39:35,500
the beyond burger on the apostle burger

1114
00:39:33,699 --> 00:39:37,089
at least 1.0 use primarily

1115
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:39,940
protein and potato protein the beyond

1116
00:39:37,090 --> 00:39:41,800
burger mostly P protein and what's

1117
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:43,750
unique about the super Gers or why we

1118
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:47,080
consider these more like the engineered

1119
00:39:43,750 --> 00:39:50,050
my protein products is at least in the

1120
00:39:47,079 --> 00:39:52,360
beyond burger the use of beet juice for

1121
00:39:50,050 --> 00:39:54,940
color but more kind of interestingly in

1122
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:57,519
the apostille burger the use of soil a

1123
00:39:54,940 --> 00:39:58,990
hemoglobin protein that they're actually

1124
00:39:57,519 --> 00:40:02,289
producing and picking up as stores in

1125
00:39:58,989 --> 00:40:06,639
this yeast and that was kind of a novel

1126
00:40:02,289 --> 00:40:08,860
ingredient for them to produce so like

1127
00:40:06,639 --> 00:40:10,299
hemoglobin just a bit so like hemoglobin

1128
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:12,700
this globin protein what they're trying

1129
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:13,930
to replicate is myoglobin in muscle

1130
00:40:12,699 --> 00:40:15,569
tissue or you know hemoglobin that

1131
00:40:13,929 --> 00:40:18,009
transports iron through the bloodstream

1132
00:40:15,570 --> 00:40:19,630
because it's an iron binding protein and

1133
00:40:18,010 --> 00:40:22,240
has this red color and it also gives it

1134
00:40:19,630 --> 00:40:23,590
that kind of bloody taste and so they

1135
00:40:22,239 --> 00:40:25,209
originally isolated this so that

1136
00:40:23,590 --> 00:40:27,190
hemoglobin from these rhizome ik nodules

1137
00:40:25,210 --> 00:40:28,780
on the fruit of the soy plant but that

1138
00:40:27,190 --> 00:40:32,079
extraction process was costly and

1139
00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:34,840
required way to large volumes of soy

1140
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:36,759
root nodules to extract sufficient

1141
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:38,920
quantities so they ended up expressing

1142
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:40,360
it in yeast and that required them

1143
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:42,670
actually to go through an entire process

1144
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:45,160
of FDA approvals demonstrate that this

1145
00:40:42,670 --> 00:40:46,780
was not in fact a new product and that

1146
00:40:45,159 --> 00:40:49,389
this was safe for human health and so

1147
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:51,100
they had to do some rat studies of the

1148
00:40:49,389 --> 00:40:53,230
soy hemoglobin extracted from yeast as

1149
00:40:51,099 --> 00:40:55,509
well as improving the yield that they

1150
00:40:53,230 --> 00:40:58,780
would get from that process originally

1151
00:40:55,510 --> 00:41:01,690
they were doing we were doing column

1152
00:40:58,780 --> 00:41:03,040
chromatography to extract that was also

1153
00:41:01,690 --> 00:41:05,800
too costly so they were able to then

1154
00:41:03,039 --> 00:41:07,869
improve yield step by step so they could

1155
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:10,210
just use weight fractionation and kind

1156
00:41:07,869 --> 00:41:12,159
of have these much larger kind of

1157
00:41:10,210 --> 00:41:14,800
fermenters the kind of similar to what

1158
00:41:12,159 --> 00:41:16,119
you would see like in a in a facility

1159
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:17,740
that's making beers that they could have

1160
00:41:16,119 --> 00:41:18,819
the gross of large quantities of the

1161
00:41:17,739 --> 00:41:21,729
yeast that then they didn't have to

1162
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:22,780
recover the same they didn't have to

1163
00:41:21,730 --> 00:41:24,309
have that like the same standard of

1164
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:28,810
recovery as they would from cosmography

1165
00:41:24,309 --> 00:41:29,409
um so if we know that the beyond burger

1166
00:41:28,809 --> 00:41:30,610
and

1167
00:41:29,409 --> 00:41:32,069
you know the beyond burgers using p

1168
00:41:30,610 --> 00:41:34,660
protein and we know that many

1169
00:41:32,070 --> 00:41:36,610
plant-based burgers are using that type

1170
00:41:34,659 --> 00:41:37,839
of protein another kind of economic

1171
00:41:36,610 --> 00:41:40,210
analysis we can do is figure out how

1172
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:43,539
many acres peas we would need to grow in

1173
00:41:40,210 --> 00:41:45,250
order to produce enough protein for the

1174
00:41:43,539 --> 00:41:47,230
projected amount of plant-based meat

1175
00:41:45,250 --> 00:41:47,900
that we're going to require I mean 2030

1176
00:41:47,230 --> 00:41:50,630
based on

1177
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:52,639
these companies so we can go through and

1178
00:41:50,630 --> 00:41:53,960
look at how much protein we get from PE

1179
00:41:52,639 --> 00:41:56,538
you know high protein varieties are

1180
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:57,769
about 25% protein the project I talked

1181
00:41:56,539 --> 00:42:00,710
about an equi not maybe can increase

1182
00:41:57,768 --> 00:42:02,598
that but right now a 25% and we look at

1183
00:42:00,710 --> 00:42:04,849
what percent protein a plant based

1184
00:42:02,599 --> 00:42:06,140
product is and then we assume what

1185
00:42:04,849 --> 00:42:08,150
percentage of plant based means find you

1186
00:42:06,139 --> 00:42:10,159
you sweet pea protein as the predominant

1187
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:11,180
ingredient goes through some

1188
00:42:10,159 --> 00:42:13,068
calculations to figure out how many

1189
00:42:11,179 --> 00:42:14,868
acres of tees we would need to have that

1190
00:42:13,068 --> 00:42:17,150
were just dedicated to producing a few

1191
00:42:14,869 --> 00:42:18,349
protein for plant based meat and so that

1192
00:42:17,150 --> 00:42:22,309
can help us project how we're going to

1193
00:42:18,349 --> 00:42:25,910
need to evaluate current land usage or

1194
00:42:22,309 --> 00:42:27,920
how we should encourage farmers to grow

1195
00:42:25,909 --> 00:42:30,498
more peas or sell cheese into the

1196
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:31,759
plant-based meat market um another thing

1197
00:42:30,498 --> 00:42:32,989
I want to point out here is that both

1198
00:42:31,759 --> 00:42:35,690
the beyond burger and the impossible

1199
00:42:32,989 --> 00:42:37,548
burger use coconut oil beyond burger

1200
00:42:35,690 --> 00:42:38,749
also uses canola oil so one of the main

1201
00:42:37,548 --> 00:42:40,190
reasons for using coconut oil is that

1202
00:42:38,748 --> 00:42:41,838
it's solid at room temperature so you

1203
00:42:40,190 --> 00:42:43,159
get that cooking processor you can have

1204
00:42:41,838 --> 00:42:45,798
a fat that stays solid throughout the

1205
00:42:43,159 --> 00:42:47,719
process but when we do kind of similar

1206
00:42:45,798 --> 00:42:50,929
scaling questions like this and look at

1207
00:42:47,719 --> 00:42:53,449
the current um coconut oil market and

1208
00:42:50,929 --> 00:42:55,940
then project demands for coconut oil

1209
00:42:53,449 --> 00:42:58,460
just from plant-based meat we're going

1210
00:42:55,940 --> 00:43:00,710
to reach kind of peak coconut in about

1211
00:42:58,460 --> 00:43:02,440
12 years so we also need to start

1212
00:43:00,710 --> 00:43:04,789
thinking about how we can encourage

1213
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:07,999
coconut oil producers to to grow more

1214
00:43:04,789 --> 00:43:09,380
coconuts more coconut oil assuming that

1215
00:43:07,998 --> 00:43:11,088
we're going to have similar demand

1216
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:14,210
trajectories for the possible burger and

1217
00:43:11,088 --> 00:43:15,349
Beyond burger that you use this so why

1218
00:43:14,210 --> 00:43:17,119
do we think we're going to continue to

1219
00:43:15,349 --> 00:43:19,519
have similar to man trajectories for

1220
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:20,989
these we do see increasing investment in

1221
00:43:19,518 --> 00:43:24,139
terms of both plant-based neat and clean

1222
00:43:20,989 --> 00:43:26,749
me um year over year in terms of both

1223
00:43:24,139 --> 00:43:29,058
deal volume and amount raised we can

1224
00:43:26,748 --> 00:43:31,219
break that out into plant-based meat on

1225
00:43:29,059 --> 00:43:33,470
the left as having raised the highest

1226
00:43:31,219 --> 00:43:35,328
amount um with a second highest number

1227
00:43:33,469 --> 00:43:38,088
of deals plant-based egg and plant-based

1228
00:43:35,329 --> 00:43:39,289
dairy close behind um clean make the

1229
00:43:38,088 --> 00:43:40,818
next thing dairy because we think that

1230
00:43:39,289 --> 00:43:42,440
those products are still you know at

1231
00:43:40,818 --> 00:43:45,018
least ten years out they've raised less

1232
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:46,608
money in a more exploratory we see a lot

1233
00:43:45,018 --> 00:43:48,588
of funding going into the development of

1234
00:43:46,608 --> 00:43:52,098
my base meat both research funding and

1235
00:43:48,588 --> 00:43:53,778
commercial funding and what we also see

1236
00:43:52,099 --> 00:43:56,269
that's interesting is that a lot of kind

1237
00:43:53,778 --> 00:43:58,159
of traditional meat companies like Tyson

1238
00:43:56,268 --> 00:43:59,479
and Cargill are also investing in meat

1239
00:43:58,159 --> 00:44:01,219
with the idea that they want to be

1240
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:02,329
protein providers and the

1241
00:44:01,219 --> 00:44:04,009
they're going to be multiple sources

1242
00:44:02,329 --> 00:44:05,960
from which people get their protein they

1243
00:44:04,010 --> 00:44:09,230
want to be part of that market not going

1244
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:10,369
to be disrupted in that sense um so I

1245
00:44:09,230 --> 00:44:13,519
want to touch on some of the kind of

1246
00:44:10,369 --> 00:44:15,590
whitespace ideas in plant-based protein

1247
00:44:13,519 --> 00:44:17,449
that we are trying to find researchers

1248
00:44:15,590 --> 00:44:19,640
who are willing to work on because we

1249
00:44:17,449 --> 00:44:21,139
have this competitive grant proposal

1250
00:44:19,639 --> 00:44:23,598
process that we run every year we get

1251
00:44:21,139 --> 00:44:25,069
out five million dollars in grant

1252
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:26,840
funding but really we give out as much

1253
00:44:25,070 --> 00:44:30,320
money as we can raise to give out

1254
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:32,900
because we're a non-profit seed you know

1255
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:34,099
research projects where we can but some

1256
00:44:32,900 --> 00:44:36,200
of the ones that we are interested in

1257
00:44:34,099 --> 00:44:37,400
people working on are like we talked

1258
00:44:36,199 --> 00:44:38,960
about increasing the yield and

1259
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:42,260
robustness of crops that are used for

1260
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:45,108
plant-based proteins adapting tolerance

1261
00:44:42,260 --> 00:44:46,280
to climate change to expand the regions

1262
00:44:45,108 --> 00:44:48,829
in which these crops can be grown and

1263
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:50,300
expand their going profile um improve

1264
00:44:48,829 --> 00:44:53,480
the amino acid profiles have produced

1265
00:44:50,300 --> 00:44:54,680
more complete proteins in a different

1266
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:57,530
variety of crops that we don't always

1267
00:44:54,679 --> 00:45:00,379
have to rely on soy and we want um that

1268
00:44:57,530 --> 00:45:02,240
complete protein improve the flavor

1269
00:45:00,380 --> 00:45:04,220
profile definitely so decreasing the

1270
00:45:02,239 --> 00:45:06,919
concentrations of saponins that can be

1271
00:45:04,219 --> 00:45:08,059
bitter isoflavone xand life oxygen aces

1272
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:11,930
that can believe to those kinds of

1273
00:45:08,059 --> 00:45:14,480
grassy and beanie off flavors we think

1274
00:45:11,929 --> 00:45:16,669
that producing fats in algae would be a

1275
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:18,949
good way to both utilize algae in terms

1276
00:45:16,670 --> 00:45:20,480
of extracting protein from it as well as

1277
00:45:18,949 --> 00:45:23,299
using it to produce an omega-3 or

1278
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:26,269
amazing fatty acids um we're looking at

1279
00:45:23,300 --> 00:45:27,560
funding platforms that assess different

1280
00:45:26,269 --> 00:45:29,630
characteristics of plant proteins within

1281
00:45:27,559 --> 00:45:31,869
processed ingredient batches to increase

1282
00:45:29,630 --> 00:45:35,300
consistency of downstream processing um

1283
00:45:31,869 --> 00:45:36,710
when we do tests of P protein if we

1284
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:38,390
imagine that we are like a plant-based

1285
00:45:36,710 --> 00:45:40,130
company we're trying to buy lots of

1286
00:45:38,389 --> 00:45:43,338
protein um for the most part they

1287
00:45:40,130 --> 00:45:46,130
include not just one varietal of peeve

1288
00:45:43,338 --> 00:45:47,449
they'll include multiple types of yellow

1289
00:45:46,130 --> 00:45:49,430
and some face is also a green pea

1290
00:45:47,449 --> 00:45:51,139
they're highly variable and they're not

1291
00:45:49,429 --> 00:45:53,210
from one particular growing region or

1292
00:45:51,139 --> 00:45:54,650
from one particular set of soil

1293
00:45:53,210 --> 00:45:56,480
characteristics or growth

1294
00:45:54,650 --> 00:45:57,829
characteristics so we want to be able to

1295
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:59,000
improve the consistency of plant

1296
00:45:57,829 --> 00:46:00,559
proteins that are available so we can

1297
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:02,750
improve the consistency of them the end

1298
00:46:00,559 --> 00:46:04,849
product when it's using something like

1299
00:46:02,750 --> 00:46:06,289
pea protein in terms of

1300
00:46:04,849 --> 00:46:08,750
functionalisation we're interested in

1301
00:46:06,289 --> 00:46:10,460
products that in projects that perform

1302
00:46:08,750 --> 00:46:12,139
customized processing of raw plant

1303
00:46:10,460 --> 00:46:14,900
protein ingredients to the specification

1304
00:46:12,139 --> 00:46:16,369
of a client's functionalisation desires

1305
00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:17,630
again the inconsistency in sight

1306
00:46:16,369 --> 00:46:19,369
proteins in terms of their functional

1307
00:46:17,630 --> 00:46:21,349
properties is a hurdle for companies

1308
00:46:19,369 --> 00:46:23,329
that are buying large quantities of key

1309
00:46:21,349 --> 00:46:25,759
protein and can't rely on on consistency

1310
00:46:23,329 --> 00:46:28,940
batch to batch and we are looking at

1311
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:31,400
projects that remove or mask off flavors

1312
00:46:28,940 --> 00:46:33,349
and plant-based proteins that can

1313
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:35,150
develop better tasting products kind of

1314
00:46:33,349 --> 00:46:36,500
the Holy Grail for plant protein is just

1315
00:46:35,150 --> 00:46:40,160
a protein it doesn't taste like anything

1316
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:42,320
just hard to achieve and particularly in

1317
00:46:40,159 --> 00:46:44,960
something like soy we're looking at ways

1318
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:47,450
to maybe mask those types of flavors in

1319
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:48,889
plant-based proteins um looking at

1320
00:46:47,449 --> 00:46:52,519
developing new binders new plant-based

1321
00:46:48,889 --> 00:46:54,469
fats pre textured proteins and looking

1322
00:46:52,519 --> 00:46:55,550
at better methods of extrusion for

1323
00:46:54,469 --> 00:46:57,469
creating that fibrous nacinda

1324
00:46:55,550 --> 00:47:00,140
plant-based meat product better sensors

1325
00:46:57,469 --> 00:47:03,589
for monitoring quality of my base meats

1326
00:47:00,139 --> 00:47:04,579
through the extrusion process um some of

1327
00:47:03,590 --> 00:47:07,850
the opportunities they're also looking

1328
00:47:04,579 --> 00:47:09,819
at our our blended proteins um so like

1329
00:47:07,849 --> 00:47:13,389
sonic makes a blended burger that is

1330
00:47:09,820 --> 00:47:16,160
partially beef blended with mushrooms

1331
00:47:13,389 --> 00:47:17,929
and we think that this is a way that we

1332
00:47:16,159 --> 00:47:21,079
can get more plant protein ingredients

1333
00:47:17,929 --> 00:47:22,279
into consumer diets or we can have

1334
00:47:21,079 --> 00:47:23,920
something that's a blend of animal

1335
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:26,750
protein and plant protein that will also

1336
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:29,780
increase our ability to be 10 billion

1337
00:47:26,750 --> 00:47:32,659
people by 2050 and so the final kind of

1338
00:47:29,780 --> 00:47:35,870
call to action is if we look at global

1339
00:47:32,659 --> 00:47:38,659
R&amp;D investment into renewable energy 11

1340
00:47:35,869 --> 00:47:39,859
when they said captured with a lot of

1341
00:47:38,659 --> 00:47:43,309
government funding a lot of private

1342
00:47:39,860 --> 00:47:44,930
funding we can see that a lot of the

1343
00:47:43,309 --> 00:47:47,900
money that was spent into developing

1344
00:47:44,929 --> 00:47:49,219
renewable energy went into types of

1345
00:47:47,900 --> 00:47:51,070
energy that aren't currently being used

1346
00:47:49,219 --> 00:47:53,059
or that weren't you know work feasible

1347
00:47:51,070 --> 00:47:55,370
we haven't we haven't been able to make

1348
00:47:53,059 --> 00:47:56,900
biofuels work but then if we compare

1349
00:47:55,369 --> 00:47:58,400
that to the amount of R&amp;D that's gone

1350
00:47:56,900 --> 00:48:00,829
into meat alternatives or just about 1

1351
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:03,019
billion you know we have plant base made

1352
00:48:00,829 --> 00:48:04,639
meat alternatives here and we really

1353
00:48:03,019 --> 00:48:07,280
think that with the addition of more

1354
00:48:04,639 --> 00:48:09,170
funding both governmental funding and

1355
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:12,050
industry funding we'll be able to make

1356
00:48:09,170 --> 00:48:13,280
much better plant-based meat products

1357
00:48:12,050 --> 00:48:15,080
improve the development of these

1358
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:17,810
products to address kind of a similar

1359
00:48:15,079 --> 00:48:21,190
environmental problem as renewable

1360
00:48:17,809 --> 00:48:23,769
energy has been developed to address

1361
00:48:21,190 --> 00:48:42,220
that's all from me we have one minute to

1362
00:48:23,769 --> 00:48:44,679
lunch questions I um I was wondering if

1363
00:48:42,219 --> 00:48:47,949
there's been any of looking into about

1364
00:48:44,679 --> 00:48:50,259
growing like protein based plants in

1365
00:48:47,949 --> 00:48:51,909
marginal environments because it's an

1366
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:53,730
argument some people in the animal

1367
00:48:51,909 --> 00:48:59,679
science community make about you know

1368
00:48:53,730 --> 00:49:01,030
weird beef cattle are grazed yeah some

1369
00:48:59,679 --> 00:49:02,409
of the from the projects that we're

1370
00:49:01,030 --> 00:49:04,089
funding to look at like how soil

1371
00:49:02,409 --> 00:49:08,500
characteristics vary in environments

1372
00:49:04,088 --> 00:49:10,210
where there's a lot of growth is aimed

1373
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:11,980
at that wondering whether we can get him

1374
00:49:10,210 --> 00:49:13,829
optimized some of these crops that they

1375
00:49:11,980 --> 00:49:16,329
produce at least like 25 percent protein

1376
00:49:13,829 --> 00:49:20,019
at soil conditions that normally

1377
00:49:16,329 --> 00:49:22,269
wouldn't be used for so we're looking at

1378
00:49:20,019 --> 00:49:26,349
that in in Israel and in Canada and in

1379
00:49:22,269 --> 00:49:29,079
India in terms of either soils varying

1380
00:49:26,349 --> 00:49:30,910
nitrogen concentrations or areas where

1381
00:49:29,079 --> 00:49:32,859
there's higher drought and looking at

1382
00:49:30,909 --> 00:49:34,568
some of these crops that can be improved

1383
00:49:32,858 --> 00:49:38,199
to be drought tolerant but still retain

1384
00:49:34,568 --> 00:49:41,769
about 25% protein um it's it's not ideal

1385
00:49:38,199 --> 00:49:42,969
but yeah part of part of the projection

1386
00:49:41,769 --> 00:49:44,259
of you know how many people are gonna

1387
00:49:42,969 --> 00:49:45,250
have to feed also includes under what

1388
00:49:44,260 --> 00:49:46,240
conditions are going to have to feed

1389
00:49:45,250 --> 00:49:48,088
them the idea that we're going to have

1390
00:49:46,239 --> 00:49:51,818
higher temperatures and more droughts

1391
00:49:48,088 --> 00:49:53,078
yeah that increases that the number of

1392
00:49:51,818 --> 00:50:00,369
areas we're going to have to grow these

1393
00:49:53,079 --> 00:50:02,500
crops so I know for some of the

1394
00:50:00,369 --> 00:50:04,480
plant-based milk products like almond

1395
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:06,608
milk soy milk there's some controversy

1396
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:10,630
about standards of identity and calling

1397
00:50:06,608 --> 00:50:12,548
it milk and so I'm kind of curious and

1398
00:50:10,630 --> 00:50:14,349
for the plant-based meats and these

1399
00:50:12,548 --> 00:50:15,639
other products this industry has been

1400
00:50:14,349 --> 00:50:16,720
around long enough that they haven't

1401
00:50:15,639 --> 00:50:20,019
come up with a better name the

1402
00:50:16,719 --> 00:50:21,699
plant-based meat but is there a centered

1403
00:50:20,019 --> 00:50:23,949
of identity conflict coming because

1404
00:50:21,699 --> 00:50:33,788
these products are very diverse

1405
00:50:23,949 --> 00:50:35,019
he comment on that at all yes these

1406
00:50:33,789 --> 00:50:36,460
products from using the term

1407
00:50:35,019 --> 00:50:38,739
meats and so we're kind of fighting that

1408
00:50:36,460 --> 00:50:40,840
bill but on the state level there are

1409
00:50:38,739 --> 00:50:42,159
kind of Cattlemen's Association groups

1410
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:44,250
another like industry groups that are

1411
00:50:42,159 --> 00:50:48,699
trying to restrict the use of terms like

1412
00:50:44,250 --> 00:50:50,739
chicken or sausage or bacon for the most

1413
00:50:48,699 --> 00:50:52,179
part because there's been such a long

1414
00:50:50,739 --> 00:50:53,769
history of these products being sold

1415
00:50:52,179 --> 00:50:56,980
under the similar names we can say that

1416
00:50:53,769 --> 00:50:58,599
there's not consumer confusion but yeah

1417
00:50:56,980 --> 00:51:00,820
on a state level there are a couple of

1418
00:50:58,599 --> 00:51:04,150
different bills mostly in in states that

1419
00:51:00,820 --> 00:51:07,660
have like large ranching interests or

1420
00:51:04,150 --> 00:51:08,710
have a lot of food production like

1421
00:51:07,659 --> 00:51:09,759
Missouri in some of those event dates

1422
00:51:08,710 --> 00:51:11,860
where they're trying to restrict the use

1423
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:15,010
of those particular like pork or chicken

1424
00:51:11,860 --> 00:51:17,079
or beef terms we haven't come up with a

1425
00:51:15,010 --> 00:51:19,470
really good alternative name so we just

1426
00:51:17,079 --> 00:51:22,150
kind of have to fight that legislatively

1427
00:51:19,469 --> 00:51:23,500
hello I wasn't sure if you might be

1428
00:51:22,150 --> 00:51:25,599
become at that but there's been work

1429
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:28,360
done on trying to make a vegan cheese

1430
00:51:25,599 --> 00:51:30,339
sort of like a plant-based cheese

1431
00:51:28,360 --> 00:51:32,710
alternative but seems like there has not

1432
00:51:30,340 --> 00:51:35,920
been in much progress of taste does that

1433
00:51:32,710 --> 00:51:38,019
seem to equate to what milk-based cheese

1434
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:44,889
can be done can you comment on that

1435
00:51:38,019 --> 00:51:46,150
what's available yeah I'm also like

1436
00:51:44,889 --> 00:51:47,440
privileged because in the Bay Area we

1437
00:51:46,150 --> 00:51:48,309
have access to all of these because so

1438
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:49,809
many of these companies are

1439
00:51:48,309 --> 00:51:55,809
headquartered in the Bay Area and so

1440
00:51:49,809 --> 00:51:58,150
distribution problem but um most of the

1441
00:51:55,809 --> 00:52:00,059
problem with making a vegan cheese is in

1442
00:51:58,150 --> 00:52:02,079
like melt ability so we can get like

1443
00:52:00,059 --> 00:52:03,849
spreadable cheeses or something that has

1444
00:52:02,079 --> 00:52:05,170
the same kind of texture as like feta

1445
00:52:03,849 --> 00:52:08,829
cheese or something that's more like

1446
00:52:05,170 --> 00:52:12,430
crumbly but getting a plant protein it

1447
00:52:08,829 --> 00:52:15,130
melts in the same way and it retains fat

1448
00:52:12,429 --> 00:52:18,009
and the same way did Jerry cheese does

1449
00:52:15,130 --> 00:52:19,630
has been a problem but yeah there I

1450
00:52:18,010 --> 00:52:21,400
guess I feel like New York owes does the

1451
00:52:19,630 --> 00:52:25,858
best there's also like light life that

1452
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:30,700
has some of these diets like a shredded

1453
00:52:25,858 --> 00:52:36,730
plant-based cheese active R&amp;B terms of

1454
00:52:30,699 --> 00:52:37,868
making better melting very high so there

1455
00:52:36,730 --> 00:52:40,809
seems to be a trend within the food

1456
00:52:37,869 --> 00:52:46,960
industry away from processed products

1457
00:52:40,809 --> 00:52:48,739
toward clean label foods just a new

1458
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:52,949
point

1459
00:52:48,739 --> 00:52:55,019
sustainability yeah it's something that

1460
00:52:52,949 --> 00:52:57,268
face or the kind of industry struggles

1461
00:52:55,018 --> 00:52:58,919
with as well as nutrition because I mean

1462
00:52:57,268 --> 00:53:01,528
they both be on burger in the impossible

1463
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:02,970
burger like have similar fat content to

1464
00:53:01,528 --> 00:53:04,710
a ground beef rigor and they're not

1465
00:53:02,969 --> 00:53:05,730
necessarily marketed it's like a health

1466
00:53:04,710 --> 00:53:07,798
product they're just mark that

1467
00:53:05,730 --> 00:53:10,679
something's supposed to replace product

1468
00:53:07,798 --> 00:53:13,559
and yeah for the most part anything that

1469
00:53:10,679 --> 00:53:15,239
that we're making is highly processed as

1470
00:53:13,559 --> 00:53:19,440
you can see like the protein extraction

1471
00:53:15,239 --> 00:53:22,739
13 extrusion um process itself category

1472
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:25,139
so for the most part based on the idea

1473
00:53:22,739 --> 00:53:27,509
that when we do survey is about like 1%

1474
00:53:25,139 --> 00:53:31,170
of the us will admit to being vegetarian

1475
00:53:27,509 --> 00:53:34,409
and lying that's a relatively small like

1476
00:53:31,170 --> 00:53:35,460
target market so for the most part what

1477
00:53:34,409 --> 00:53:37,108
these companies are trying to do is get

1478
00:53:35,460 --> 00:53:39,869
people who are poor kind of words

1479
00:53:37,108 --> 00:53:41,818
reflect Aryans to like try this product

1480
00:53:39,869 --> 00:53:45,390
that's just going to be a substitute in

1481
00:53:41,818 --> 00:53:49,318
terms of taste and price and not looking

1482
00:53:45,389 --> 00:53:52,259
as much into replacing like the less

1483
00:53:49,318 --> 00:53:55,048
processed foods that represent a smaller

1484
00:53:52,259 --> 00:53:56,489
proportion of the market um it's it's

1485
00:53:55,048 --> 00:53:57,989
definitely a concern for like a lot of

1486
00:53:56,489 --> 00:53:59,460
people that I work with because when you

1487
00:53:57,989 --> 00:54:00,389
use when you work at a think tank of

1488
00:53:59,460 --> 00:54:01,920
supports there's like a lot of people

1489
00:54:00,389 --> 00:54:03,719
that I work with are vegan or vegetarian

1490
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:05,309
and are also concerned with like

1491
00:54:03,719 --> 00:54:07,649
concerned with food processing and with

1492
00:54:05,309 --> 00:54:09,180
eating hard rock but I would say that's

1493
00:54:07,650 --> 00:54:13,920
still relatively Anish concern as

1494
00:54:09,179 --> 00:54:16,169
compared to taste lower down on the on

1495
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:20,460
the consumer checklist in terms of

1496
00:54:16,170 --> 00:54:23,880
choosing what to buy okay you mentioned

1497
00:54:20,460 --> 00:54:26,999
that yeast fermentation improve the

1498
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:34,259
enticing content of most protein does

1499
00:54:26,998 --> 00:54:36,058
this work for meat and Wadley - I mean I

1500
00:54:34,259 --> 00:54:41,579
I don't see why it wouldn't but we have

1501
00:54:36,059 --> 00:54:45,450
in if you would like to study that apply

1502
00:54:41,579 --> 00:54:47,009
to our program just fall wait yeah I

1503
00:54:45,449 --> 00:54:48,960
mean so one of the problems with Oh

1504
00:54:47,009 --> 00:54:52,588
protein that they're trying to improve

1505
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:54,298
is the profile and so that's relatively

1506
00:54:52,588 --> 00:54:59,099
unique to terms of the lower levels of

1507
00:54:54,298 --> 00:55:01,528
lysine some of the happenin content is

1508
00:54:59,099 --> 00:55:01,970
not present in wheat but there's nothing

1509
00:55:01,528 --> 00:55:05,179
to say that

1510
00:55:01,969 --> 00:55:06,439
wouldn't improve the taste profile of

1511
00:55:05,179 --> 00:55:09,730
wieder barley as well when we're looking

1512
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:09,730
particularly in terms of how well

1513
00:55:10,269 --> 00:55:16,190
thinking of these plant-based protein as

1514
00:55:14,269 --> 00:55:17,719
a consumer product the price that he has

1515
00:55:16,190 --> 00:55:19,159
is it mostly to you because he's

1516
00:55:17,719 --> 00:55:20,569
actually that complex to make crazy

1517
00:55:19,159 --> 00:55:22,579
because it's new and the company needs

1518
00:55:20,570 --> 00:55:24,500
to survive so I'm kind of curious how

1519
00:55:22,579 --> 00:55:27,529
the price would compare if like meat was

1520
00:55:24,500 --> 00:55:29,750
price as expensively as it should given

1521
00:55:27,530 --> 00:55:31,460
all the inputs that it needs yeah I

1522
00:55:29,750 --> 00:55:33,619
would actually compete in that weird

1523
00:55:31,460 --> 00:55:36,139
yeah I mean all companies are aiming for

1524
00:55:33,619 --> 00:55:39,410
price parity the beyond Berger is

1525
00:55:36,139 --> 00:55:42,079
probably like a dollar so per burger

1526
00:55:39,409 --> 00:55:44,929
more expensive than ground beef um some

1527
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:49,730
of it is to recap R&amp;D costs some of it

1528
00:55:44,929 --> 00:55:52,940
is because the processing steps are more

1529
00:55:49,730 --> 00:55:55,608
involved but I some of the cost also

1530
00:55:52,940 --> 00:55:58,730
comes from the the fat they need to add

1531
00:55:55,608 --> 00:56:02,539
to it in terms of the prices coconut oil

1532
00:55:58,730 --> 00:56:05,240
um but as they're able to scale up and

1533
00:56:02,539 --> 00:56:06,409
so like other increasing the size of

1534
00:56:05,239 --> 00:56:09,469
their facilities that price should come

1535
00:56:06,409 --> 00:56:11,539
down and actually when both beyond and

1536
00:56:09,469 --> 00:56:13,639
impossible did a lifecycle analysis of

1537
00:56:11,539 --> 00:56:16,820
the product they found that not only one

1538
00:56:13,639 --> 00:56:18,199
of the main contributors to to water use

1539
00:56:16,820 --> 00:56:19,580
into greenhouse gas emissions also know

1540
00:56:18,199 --> 00:56:21,368
the main contributors to price was the

1541
00:56:19,579 --> 00:56:24,619
packaging materials that they're using

1542
00:56:21,369 --> 00:56:27,980
to look into better and also more

1543
00:56:24,619 --> 00:56:29,960
biodegradable just trays and kind of

1544
00:56:27,980 --> 00:56:31,490
plastic wrap so they can sell it in a

1545
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:34,519
way that it looks like it's packaged

1546
00:56:31,489 --> 00:56:35,929
like it's ground beef but and something

1547
00:56:34,519 --> 00:56:38,079
that's more easily recyclable because

1548
00:56:35,929 --> 00:56:44,059
that ended up being one of the primary

1549
00:56:38,079 --> 00:56:46,519
so that like packaging is also so so it

1550
00:56:44,059 --> 00:56:49,039
seems like there are many issues that

1551
00:56:46,519 --> 00:56:52,699
could be helped with genetic engineering

1552
00:56:49,039 --> 00:56:55,309
I mean things like hydrogenation levels

1553
00:56:52,699 --> 00:56:57,399
of non coconut oils and and fats and

1554
00:56:55,309 --> 00:57:00,500
stuff like that is that something that

1555
00:56:57,400 --> 00:57:14,000
you guys are actively trying to stay

1556
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:15,559
away from so can't can somebody out

1557
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:19,480
there make synthetic

1558
00:57:15,559 --> 00:57:22,190
you know make canola make coconut oil

1559
00:57:19,480 --> 00:57:23,329
ideally yeah yeah I mean I tell you'd be

1560
00:57:22,190 --> 00:57:26,420
able to so that's one of the projects

1561
00:57:23,329 --> 00:57:28,429
trying to look at algae as a way that we

1562
00:57:26,420 --> 00:57:30,079
can produce some of these fats exogenous

1563
00:57:28,429 --> 00:57:31,909
Li um

1564
00:57:30,079 --> 00:57:34,009
cost is probably still going to be an

1565
00:57:31,909 --> 00:57:36,769
issue but yeah hopefully we can use some

1566
00:57:34,010 --> 00:57:44,510
kind of platform like like a user

1567
00:57:36,769 --> 00:57:50,210
bacterial platform to produce are there

1568
00:57:44,510 --> 00:57:52,609
any other so in terms of nutritional

1569
00:57:50,210 --> 00:57:54,980
quality you showed a graph of the

1570
00:57:52,608 --> 00:57:56,420
different iron contents of some crops

1571
00:57:54,980 --> 00:57:57,889
that people are using for these plant

1572
00:57:56,420 --> 00:57:59,809
based beets are they also measuring

1573
00:57:57,889 --> 00:58:01,730
phytate levels to try to get at maybe

1574
00:57:59,809 --> 00:58:03,920
some of the iron bioavailable

1575
00:58:01,730 --> 00:58:08,480
bioavailability issues that might come

1576
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:14,510
with plants replacing meats yeah yeah

1577
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:16,579
particularly and and in general just the

1578
00:58:14,510 --> 00:58:17,690
bioavailability of the protein in the

1579
00:58:16,579 --> 00:58:19,699
plants that we're trying to engineer to

1580
00:58:17,690 --> 00:58:22,670
have higher protein content and like so

1581
00:58:19,699 --> 00:58:24,348
in the pea study we're not just trying

1582
00:58:22,670 --> 00:58:26,409
to increase the percentage of protein

1583
00:58:24,349 --> 00:58:30,349
available in the dry pbl so than the bio

1584
00:58:26,409 --> 00:58:32,989
as its processed or cooked because we

1585
00:58:30,349 --> 00:58:34,430
don't want to increase the protein love

1586
00:58:32,989 --> 00:58:36,969
increase the protein concentration but

1587
00:58:34,429 --> 00:58:43,210
not be able to then extract that version

1588
00:58:36,969 --> 00:58:43,209
yeah that's also part of what economists

1589
00:58:44,920 --> 00:58:55,940
question do you think that food will be

1590
00:58:51,800 --> 00:58:59,240
affordable in 2050 if we use this method

1591
00:58:55,940 --> 00:59:01,579
because it's a very expensive process so

1592
00:58:59,239 --> 00:59:03,319
I believe we'll have available food but

1593
00:59:01,579 --> 00:59:08,509
do you think it will be affordable that

1594
00:59:03,320 --> 00:59:11,230
time yeah is a concern that we're also

1595
00:59:08,510 --> 00:59:14,200
looking at how how the cost of producing

1596
00:59:11,230 --> 00:59:16,820
livestock might increase as we're either

1597
00:59:14,199 --> 00:59:18,500
as either the crops we used to feed the

1598
00:59:16,820 --> 00:59:20,030
livestock increase in price or as we're

1599
00:59:18,500 --> 00:59:22,250
running out of room as in the case with

1600
00:59:20,030 --> 00:59:26,180
like fisheries we're running out of

1601
00:59:22,250 --> 00:59:28,670
coastline that could be leased so we're

1602
00:59:26,179 --> 00:59:30,230
both trying to reduce the price of

1603
00:59:28,670 --> 00:59:33,019
based me and also looking at maybe some

1604
00:59:30,230 --> 00:59:35,059
kind of like intersecting purple prices

1605
00:59:33,018 --> 00:59:41,868
where we would see the price of animal

1606
00:59:35,059 --> 00:59:44,089
meat increase and the like the least

1607
00:59:41,869 --> 00:59:46,640
expensive way to eat would just be to

1608
00:59:44,088 --> 00:59:49,639
eat some of these vegetables and pulses

1609
00:59:46,639 --> 00:59:50,629
and grains like on their own and not try

1610
00:59:49,639 --> 00:59:52,389
to make them into something like the

1611
00:59:50,630 --> 00:59:54,769
beyond burger the impossible burger um

1612
00:59:52,389 --> 00:59:57,379
the idea behind those is that we want to

1613
00:59:54,768 --> 01:00:02,018
to replace something that's a Gregorian

1614
00:59:57,380 --> 01:00:04,700
efficient something that is hopefully

1615
01:00:02,018 --> 01:00:06,528
yeah as price is a concern like we can

1616
01:00:04,699 --> 01:00:08,568
oh we have that graph of the different

1617
01:00:06,528 --> 01:00:09,920
protein levels and protein sources like

1618
01:00:08,568 --> 01:00:11,869
yes you can meet your daily protein

1619
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:16,010
requirement just with vegetable proteins

1620
01:00:11,869 --> 01:00:20,180
and those are cheaper than animal-based

1621
01:00:16,010 --> 01:00:21,859
proteins yeah from from a purely

1622
01:00:20,179 --> 01:00:24,588
economic standpoint like sure don't buy

1623
01:00:21,858 --> 01:00:28,130
the impossible burgers buy like rice and

1624
01:00:24,588 --> 01:00:37,308
lentils and however you like with other

1625
01:00:28,130 --> 01:00:39,680
vegetables we want to replace we have

1626
01:00:37,309 --> 01:00:42,019
one final question from zoom and your

1627
01:00:39,679 --> 01:00:44,210
bell D asks besides the process of

1628
01:00:42,018 --> 01:00:46,568
fermentation are you also looking into

1629
01:00:44,210 --> 01:00:55,460
improving the quality of the protein of

1630
01:00:46,568 --> 01:00:59,989
these crops by GM or other means that's

1631
01:00:55,460 --> 01:01:01,630
what they are yeah yeah so like some of

1632
01:00:59,989 --> 01:01:04,608
the studies that economists doing are

1633
01:01:01,630 --> 01:01:05,809
looking at improving the the

1634
01:01:04,608 --> 01:01:11,298
concentrations and availability of that

1635
01:01:05,809 --> 01:01:13,759
protein also improving the GM is one way

1636
01:01:11,298 --> 01:01:15,079
to do that and the particular like oak

1637
01:01:13,759 --> 01:01:17,000
protein project is just looking at

1638
01:01:15,079 --> 01:01:19,250
fermentation because they're a lab that

1639
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:20,449
studies fermentation so they had this

1640
01:01:19,250 --> 01:01:23,018
idea that fermentation because like an

1641
01:01:20,449 --> 01:01:25,939
easy and cost-effective way to uh to

1642
01:01:23,018 --> 01:01:28,250
improve the completeness of the protein

1643
01:01:25,940 --> 01:01:30,559
and to decrease the concentrations of I

1644
01:01:28,250 --> 01:01:33,920
supply bones and saponins in the

1645
01:01:30,559 --> 01:01:35,810
oportunity racks but so

1646
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:39,740
another lab may be able to improve oat

1647
01:01:35,809 --> 01:01:47,509
protein in a different process all right

1648
01:01:39,739 --> 01:01:49,279
can we all join and thank Elsa this has
