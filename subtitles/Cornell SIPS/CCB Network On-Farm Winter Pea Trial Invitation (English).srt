Hi my name is Solveig Hanson and I'm coordinator  for the Cover Crop Breeding Network. I'm here at  

3
00:00:13,839 --> 00:00:19,879
one of Cornell University's research farms at our  winter pea nursery. For about 6 years the Cover  

4
00:00:19,879 --> 00:00:24,280
Crop Breeding Network has been breeding  winter peas for cover crop use -- which  

5
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:30,080
means reliable winter survival, strong  spring vigor and high biomass. Winter pea  

6
00:00:30,079 --> 00:00:36,399
breeding starts here in breeding nurseries where  we select the best individual plants. Winter  

7
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:42,519
pea breeding continues here in our advanced  line trial fields. Over the past six years,  

8
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:49,160
we've trialed winter peas in about 50 different  locations. The best of our breeding lines are  

9
00:00:49,159 --> 00:00:53,679
moving toward commercial availability and we've  also identified some excellent commercially  

10
00:00:53,679 --> 00:01:00,320
available cultivars. So now if you live in  Hardiness Zones 3 through 6 -- so a place with  

11
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:07,640
a cold winter -- we're inviting you to join our  winter pea trialing efforts. If you participate,  

12
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:15,159
you receive enough seed to sow about a 15-foot  row of four different varieties. We'll ask you to  

13
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:22,239
photograph and rate the plots three times during  the season using an app called SeedLinked, which  

14
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:29,439
is designed for collaborative variety trialing.  We'll ask you to rate for traits like emergence,  

15
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:35,480
vigor, winter hardiness and yield. Cover crops are  essential for soil health, but they can also be  

16
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:41,159
delicious. We will be working with the Stone Barn  Center for Food and Agriculture and Blue Hill at  

17
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:47,000
Stone Barns to learn about evaluating flavor in  winter peas with tips like this. So there's two  

18
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,280
main traits that we're going to look at. One  is the flavor. So that's the overall enjoyment  

19
00:01:52,280 --> 00:02:00,280
of these peas sweetness, earthiness. 1 through 5.  So 1 is very unpleasant, never try it again. 4 or  

20
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:04,719
5 is I would seek this out. This is my  favorite salad green ever. We hope you  

21
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:10,080
join us this fall in trialing winter pea cover  crop varieties on your farm or in your garden.
