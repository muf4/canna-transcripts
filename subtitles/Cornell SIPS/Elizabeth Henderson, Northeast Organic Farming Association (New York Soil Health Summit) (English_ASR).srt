00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:04,609
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,218 --> 00:00:08,009
University

3
00:00:04,609 --> 00:00:10,349
good morning although I wish we had

4
00:00:08,009 --> 00:00:13,589
started doing this soil health roadmap

5
00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:16,070
back in the 1970s I'm really happy that

6
00:00:13,589 --> 00:00:18,719
we're working on it together now I

7
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:21,629
confess I feel really challenged to talk

8
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:23,969
about in five minutes the decades of

9
00:00:21,629 --> 00:00:26,609
work that organic farmers have done in

10
00:00:23,969 --> 00:00:29,879
relation to soil health this has been

11
00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:33,090
our top priority and our one orthodoxy

12
00:00:29,879 --> 00:00:36,299
if you have healthy soils soils that are

13
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:38,309
biologically alive and active you will

14
00:00:36,299 --> 00:00:40,709
have healthy crops and the people on

15
00:00:38,308 --> 00:00:44,128
animals who eat their crops will be

16
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:47,429
healthy our advice to farmers feed the

17
00:00:44,128 --> 00:00:50,039
soil not the plants far as the Vermont

18
00:00:47,429 --> 00:00:52,978
guidelines organic certification state

19
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:55,170
the overarching goal to improve and

20
00:00:52,978 --> 00:00:58,798
maintain the long term fertility of

21
00:00:55,170 --> 00:01:01,109
soils I speak today on behalf of the

22
00:00:58,798 --> 00:01:05,819
Northeast organic farming Association of

23
00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:09,390
we work it was founded in 1983 but NOFA

24
00:01:05,819 --> 00:01:11,879
was started in the early seventies as an

25
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:14,909
interstate northeast organization and

26
00:01:11,879 --> 00:01:17,399
it's the premier statewide organization

27
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:19,500
growing a strong and healthy organic and

28
00:01:17,399 --> 00:01:22,170
sustainable agriculture movement in New

29
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:24,209
York State we provide education and

30
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:26,969
assistance to local organic and

31
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:29,608
sustainable farms connecting farms and

32
00:01:26,968 --> 00:01:32,548
consumers and then we advocate for

33
00:01:29,608 --> 00:01:34,559
policies that support a sustainable food

34
00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:37,789
and farm system at both the state and

35
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:40,978
federal level we also have the largest

36
00:01:37,789 --> 00:01:43,530
USDA accredited certification program in

37
00:01:40,978 --> 00:01:46,978
New York and this past year we surpassed

38
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:48,450
the 1,000 farm mark for certification in

39
00:01:46,978 --> 00:01:50,640
New York

40
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:53,759
another New York in cooperation with the

41
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:56,159
other six NOFA chapters in the Northeast

42
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:59,099
states and also often in cooperation

43
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:01,950
with maka have been engaged in a

44
00:01:59,099 --> 00:02:04,158
multi-year project to identify the best

45
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:07,500
practices for building soil health and

46
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:09,868
increasing carbon by identifying the

47
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:14,610
farmers who are doing the outstanding

48
00:02:09,868 --> 00:02:17,340
work in carbon farming methods that

49
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:21,690
restore carbon to the soil and keep it

50
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:24,870
there for the long term in legal

51
00:02:21,689 --> 00:02:28,829
pathways to carbon neutral agriculture

52
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:32,400
Peter Lehman leaner and Nathan Rosenberg

53
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:34,200
defying Carbon Farming as a suite of

54
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,750
climate friendly practices and

55
00:02:34,199 --> 00:02:39,750
strategies designed result in optimal

56
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:43,169
environmental societal and climate

57
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:46,939
outcomes so that's what we are trying to

58
00:02:43,169 --> 00:02:49,649
encourage organic farmers to do more of

59
00:02:46,939 --> 00:02:51,750
organic farmers strive for integrated

60
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:53,549
whole farm plans that's what you have to

61
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:57,000
do in order to be certified you have to

62
00:02:53,549 --> 00:03:00,000
create a plan with complex interrelated

63
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,219
goals so the nofa's have identified

64
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,379
farmers with outstanding soil health

65
00:03:02,219 --> 00:03:07,530
practices by holding roundtables that

66
00:03:04,379 --> 00:03:10,199
are winter conferences and then once we

67
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:12,719
identify these farmers we encourage them

68
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:16,469
to share their practices so it's farmers

69
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:19,259
learn to hold workshops and feel these

70
00:03:16,469 --> 00:03:25,370
their farms we've done that in New York

71
00:03:19,259 --> 00:03:27,840
State by having these soil health feel

72
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:30,269
roundtables at the winter conferences

73
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,430
and then having field days at farms in

74
00:03:30,269 --> 00:03:35,280
this photo that we see before you is

75
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:38,939
from Four Winds farm where we held a

76
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:43,349
field day in 2016 and they have a

77
00:03:38,939 --> 00:03:47,549
no-till vegetable farm where they also

78
00:03:43,349 --> 00:03:49,650
produce their own compost so the

79
00:03:47,549 --> 00:03:52,139
workshops at our winter conferences

80
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:54,959
cover the science of soil health and

81
00:03:52,139 --> 00:03:57,150
also a wide range of practices that

82
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:59,789
build soil carbon

83
00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:04,079
and our annual conferences have taken

84
00:03:59,789 --> 00:04:06,688
things like diversify regenerate healing

85
00:04:04,079 --> 00:04:10,620
the climate healing ourselves with keen

86
00:04:06,688 --> 00:04:13,469
odors like dr. Lanham Fred Magdala Eric

87
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:16,590
to inspire West Jackson Wendell Berry

88
00:04:13,469 --> 00:04:19,649
Andre you and David Montgomery and his

89
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:24,060

interstate publication the natural

92
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:34,799
farmer focused on climate change and

93
00:04:30,629 --> 00:04:37,800
soil health and that's now archived on

94
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:40,680
the natural farmer website so you can

95
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:42,720
access them easily and the NOFA

96
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:45,180
Massachusetts chapter has taken the lead

97
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:47,610
in providing resource materials for this

98
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:51,418

106
00:05:12,019 --> 00:05:18,589
kittredges white paper has now been

107
00:05:14,668 --> 00:05:18,589
translated into 17 languages

108
00:05:19,959 --> 00:05:27,099
north amasses been doing examine aiding

109
00:05:24,279 --> 00:05:30,819
examining the laboratory test for

110
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:34,180
measuring soil carbon and we found that

111
00:05:30,819 --> 00:05:37,269
they're still really inadequate and also

112
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:39,220
expensive so instead what we've been

113
00:05:37,269 --> 00:05:42,549
trying to do is to develop a number of

114
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:45,310
tests adapted from agricultural and

115
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:48,310
institutions like the NRCS and Cornell

116
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:51,699
very simple and that farmers and

117
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:54,339
gardeners can do themselves tests for

118
00:05:51,699 --> 00:05:57,160
soil quality vitality and carbon

119
00:05:54,339 --> 00:05:59,258
sequestration capability and they've

120
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:02,139
included that the rest procedure is to

121
00:05:59,259 --> 00:06:04,840
run these tests annually on the same

122
00:06:02,139 --> 00:06:08,228
ground and note the changes that occur

123
00:06:04,839 --> 00:06:11,019
since the last time I'm a single test

124
00:06:08,228 --> 00:06:15,008
that seems to be the most the best

125
00:06:11,019 --> 00:06:17,680
measure is to test for water

126
00:06:15,009 --> 00:06:20,710
infiltration and I see that the farmers

127
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:22,389
who've been doing that also looking at

128
00:06:20,709 --> 00:06:24,848
that themselves that it's a simple thing

129
00:06:22,389 --> 00:06:28,930
that you can do based on the work of

130
00:06:24,848 --> 00:06:32,829
NRCS better water infiltration indicates

131
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:36,250
more pores or aggregates and that

132
00:06:32,829 --> 00:06:39,879
indicates that there's more soil carbon

133
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:43,379
and greater soil life so the NOFA

134
00:06:39,879 --> 00:06:46,300
certification program also encourages

135
00:06:43,379 --> 00:06:48,009
prescribed grazing and NOFA New York

136
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:52,780
together with no further land have

137
00:06:48,009 --> 00:06:56,918
introduced 100% grass bed standards so

138
00:06:52,779 --> 00:06:59,198
this is a side of a farm that has a

139
00:06:56,918 --> 00:07:02,348
chicken tractor and they've integrated

140
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:06,250
the livestock into their vegetable

141
00:07:02,348 --> 00:07:09,848
production Nova New York has created in

142
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:12,668
New York org in an action plan and you

143
00:07:09,848 --> 00:07:15,550
can see them on our website and our top

144
00:07:12,668 --> 00:07:18,399
legislative priority for this plan is to

145
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:21,009
create a healthy soils program in New

146
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:23,799
York State we want to support research

147
00:07:21,009 --> 00:07:26,530
to increase understanding of soil health

148
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:30,189
and the connection between soil health

149
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:33,089
and the nutritional value of food and so

150
00:07:30,189 --> 00:07:34,800
I'm really excited to be here and

151
00:07:33,089 --> 00:07:36,869
work together on theme which is the

152
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:39,750
legislation that would be most effective

153
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:41,939
on the federal level you work on the

154
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:43,439
farm bill and we would like to see

155
00:07:41,939 --> 00:07:46,319
increased funding for soil health

156
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:49,219
research greater understanding the role

157
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:51,810
of Agriculture and climate mitigation

158
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:55,410
technical assistance and conservation

159
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:57,720
programs through NRCS conservation

160
00:07:55,410 --> 00:08:00,689
reserve program and funding for buffers

161
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:03,150
to protect organic farms we're a member

162
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:05,670
of the National Organic Coalition which

163
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:08,759
advocates for increased funding organic

164
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:12,810
research through Hawaii I and adding

165
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:15,779
soil health as a priority NOFA also

166
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:18,420
supports the Senate farm bill language

167
00:08:15,779 --> 00:08:20,039
there are two farm bill versions that

168
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:22,800
are out there and we would like to see

169
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:25,230
the farm the Senate version which will

170
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,790
strengthen conservation programs instead

171
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:29,879
of cutting out the conservation

172
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:32,370
stewardship program and increase payment

173
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:35,429
levels for cover crops resource

174
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:38,370
conserving crop rotations and management

175
00:08:35,429 --> 00:08:40,409
intensive rotational grazing and we

176
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:42,419
believe that government and university

177
00:08:40,409 --> 00:08:44,600
programs should spread information

178
00:08:42,419 --> 00:08:48,059
together on climate related practices

179
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:51,120
and that farmers that do not practice

180
00:08:48,059 --> 00:08:56,299
basic conservation shouldn't be eligible

181
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:56,299
for you RCS and that's plan thank you
