1
00:00:01,639 --> 00:00:05,280
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:07,559 --> 00:00:12,280
University thank you everyone I hope you

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,359
can hear me all right so I'm going to

4
00:00:12,279 --> 00:00:16,960
jump right into introducing my

5
00:00:14,359 --> 00:00:20,160
dissertation topic on copper uptake by

6
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:21,679
grasses at the plant soil interface so

7
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,839
copper is an essential plant

8
00:00:21,679 --> 00:00:27,239
micronutrient and it plays an important

9
00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:29,800
role in photosynthesis respiration and

10
00:00:27,239 --> 00:00:32,920
reproduction in plants now plants get

11
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:35,558
their Copper from soil and as you can

12
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:38,200
see from this map of the US copper is

13
00:00:35,558 --> 00:00:40,039
naturally present in soils but this is

14
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:42,079
total concentration and total

15
00:00:40,039 --> 00:00:44,800
concentration is not the same as

16
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:46,799
availability as we know because soil

17
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:50,919
conditions change availability of

18
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:53,599
nutrients in soil so here we can see

19
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:56,800
that

20
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:59,518
copper absorbed in higher concentrations

21
00:00:56,799 --> 00:01:03,599
to these soil constituents as we move up

22
00:00:59,518 --> 00:01:06,679
in pH so specifically copper absorbs to

23
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:09,280
iron oxides in soil it also forms

24
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:11,600
complexes with Organic Matter this

25
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:14,920
severely limits the availability of

26
00:01:11,599 --> 00:01:18,199
copper in soil and this is particularly

27
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:21,200
problematic in this PH range 6 to about

28
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:22,799
7.5 which we know is what plants prefer

29
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,280
in agricultural

30
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:28,880
systems and this limitation of copper

31
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:30,478
availability in soils severely decreases

32
00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:32,959
agricultural production

33
00:01:30,478 --> 00:01:36,039
in these deficient soils particularly

34
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:39,839
soils with high organic matter

35
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:40,600
content so as was shown by the banuk lab

36
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:45,159
in

37
00:01:40,599 --> 00:01:48,718
2021 wheat is here and the model species

38
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:52,399
for wheat rodium dakon which I work

39
00:01:48,718 --> 00:01:54,718
on are both very susceptible to copper

40
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:56,840
deficiency when copper is at low

41
00:01:54,718 --> 00:02:00,199
concentrations in their media they

42
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:02,920
struggle to produce grain interestingly

43
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:06,640
at low concentrations both wheat and

44
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:08,159
braip Podium show not a huge difference

45
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,959
in the amount of flowers that they

46
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:12,719
produce but they do produce

47
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:15,039
significantly fewer seeds what this

48
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:17,039
means for a farmer in a copper deficient

49
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:18,878
soil you could go out into your field

50
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:21,199
and see tons of wheat flowering and

51
00:02:18,878 --> 00:02:23,919
think I'm going to have a great harvest

52
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:25,799
you go out there in reality if you have

53
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:29,159
copper deficiency you could have low

54
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:31,000
seed set this is an issue for food

55
00:02:29,159 --> 00:02:33,079
security

56
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,318
because wheat requires sufficient copper

57
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:38,640
to produce

58
00:02:35,318 --> 00:02:40,958
grain wheat is a member of the poesy

59
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:43,958
family or the grass family which

60
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:45,158
includes the key grain producing species

61
00:02:43,959 --> 00:02:47,719
in

62
00:02:45,158 --> 00:02:50,199
agriculture and the mechanism of copper

63
00:02:47,719 --> 00:02:53,199
uptake in these grasses as indicated by

64
00:02:50,199 --> 00:02:56,399
my title has not been

65
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:58,839
defined so this is the question that

66
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:01,599
I've dedicated my dissertation to what

67
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:03,680
is the copper uptake mechanism in

68
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:05,359
grasses in order to look at this

69
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:10,560
question I'm starting with the knowledge

70
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:13,799
we already have so for dcot or non-g

71
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:16,840
grasses copper is taken up by first

72
00:03:13,799 --> 00:03:19,719
being reduced in the soil so copper in

73
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:22,039
the soil is oxidized it gets this extra

74
00:03:19,719 --> 00:03:25,318
electron it's reduced and now it's

75
00:03:22,039 --> 00:03:27,400
available for uptake by non grasses the

76
00:03:25,318 --> 00:03:30,079
same mechanism is required for iron

77
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:32,120
uptake in non-grass plants so iron has

78
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:35,519
to be reduced before it's available for

79
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:38,158
uptake in non- grasses the grasses

80
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:41,438
interestingly have a different mechanism

81
00:03:38,158 --> 00:03:44,239
they take up oxidized iron we don't know

82
00:03:41,438 --> 00:03:47,239
how they take up copper but for the iron

83
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:49,878
to be taken up it must first be heated

84
00:03:47,239 --> 00:03:52,360
before it is available for grasses to

85
00:03:49,878 --> 00:03:55,639
access in the

86
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:57,760
soil in my dissertation I am spending my

87
00:03:55,639 --> 00:04:00,119
first two chapters looking at the

88
00:03:57,759 --> 00:04:02,399
mechanisms that I just discussed so

89
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:04,480
considering the reduction mechanism and

90
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:07,519
its efficiency for copper uptake and

91
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:10,438
grasses same deal for the culation based

92
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:12,519
mechanism in my third chapter going to

93
00:04:10,438 --> 00:04:15,799
look at these mechanisms in a soil

94
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:18,600
system and consider how soil conditions

95
00:04:15,799 --> 00:04:21,680
impact the function of these uptake

96
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:24,040
mechanisms in

97
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:26,400
grasses so the objective of my first

98
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:29,160
chapter is to establish the copper

99
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:31,959
deficiency response in braip Podium the

100
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:35,439
model graph species I'm using via the

101
00:04:31,959 --> 00:04:38,038
reduction based uptake

102
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:41,360
mechanism so this is the reduction upake

103
00:04:38,038 --> 00:04:45,399
mechanism in non-grass

104
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:47,800
plants so in order for copper and iron

105
00:04:45,399 --> 00:04:49,599
here it's showing Iron same for both to

106
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:52,840
be taken up by the reduction based

107
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:55,720
mechanism in non- grasses the plant oh

108
00:04:52,839 --> 00:04:57,399
sorry the plant which is on the left

109
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:59,919
side here this is the inside of the

110
00:04:57,399 --> 00:05:02,679
plant cell this is the plasma membrane

111
00:04:59,918 --> 00:05:05,120
cell wall this is the soil and here we

112
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:07,439
have the oxidized iron in the soil so

113
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:10,399
the plant first has to solubilize this

114
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:12,240
oxidized iron it does this by producing

115
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:15,079
protons and potentially phenolic

116
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:17,600
compounds that mobilize oxidized iron in

117
00:05:15,079 --> 00:05:20,680
the soil so that it can move into the

118
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:23,840
cell wall and interact with this plasma

119
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:26,800
membrane bound feric reductase oxygenase

120
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:30,079
enzyme this fro enzyme gives that

121
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:32,680
oxidized metal the electron it needs so

122
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:36,758
now it can be taken up by high Affinity

123
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:36,759
Transporters and brought into the root

124
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:42,880
cell as I mentioned before this uptake

125
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:45,318
pathway functions for both iron and

126
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:48,240
copper uptake but you may note that in

127
00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:50,080
this model with a rabid opsis these frog

128
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,120
are somewhat different so these are

129
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:54,279
different frogans for the different

130
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:56,360
metals and different High Affinity

131
00:05:54,279 --> 00:05:58,559
Transporters for the different Metals

132
00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:01,160
they're very specific in each of these

133
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:04,199
uptake mechanisms

134
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:07,759
now looking at arabidopsis as an example

135
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:10,879
of a non-grass species arabidopsis

136
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:14,319
expresses eight of these froin whereas

137
00:06:10,879 --> 00:06:16,680
braip Podium expresses only two this is

138
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:18,879
one of the reasons that we hypothesize

139
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:21,160
that the reduction-based mechanism is

140
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:24,038
not the primary copper uptake mechanism

141
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:25,840
in grasses and will not respond strongly

142
00:06:24,038 --> 00:06:27,918
to copper

143
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:29,839
deficiency to investigate this

144
00:06:27,918 --> 00:06:31,918
hypothesis

145
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:34,758
I am cultivating braip podium in deep

146
00:06:31,918 --> 00:06:37,159
water Hydroponics doing this because

147
00:06:34,759 --> 00:06:40,120
during the last week of cultivation I

148
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:41,880
can completely deprive these plants of

149
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:43,918
these nutrients and look at their

150
00:06:41,879 --> 00:06:47,159
response so I'm growing them with three

151
00:06:43,918 --> 00:06:49,159
treatments I have a control I have no

152
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:52,120
copper in the system for the last week

153
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:55,199
and no iron in the system for the last

154
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:57,720
week after these plants are harvested I

155
00:06:55,199 --> 00:07:01,199
have a two-pronged approach to analyzing

156
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:03,720
the reduction mechanism so first I sever

157
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:05,919
the plant roots from the Chute tissues

158
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:08,440
they're then incubated in solutions that

159
00:07:05,918 --> 00:07:11,878
contain chromophores these Solutions

160
00:07:08,439 --> 00:07:14,759
develop color over time based on the

161
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:16,599
amount of metals the roots are reducing

162
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:19,400
I take an aliquat after a specific

163
00:07:16,598 --> 00:07:22,240
amount of time of this solution and

164
00:07:19,399 --> 00:07:24,679
measure it using UV viz which can allow

165
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:27,079
me to calculate the concentration of

166
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:30,560
metals reduced by The Roots using a

167
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:32,639
rearrangement of the beer Lambert law

168
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,439
my other method of analysis is to

169
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:36,918
evaluate the

170
00:07:34,439 --> 00:07:39,959
transcriptional expression of the feric

171
00:07:36,918 --> 00:07:42,680
reductase genes in braip Podium so first

172
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:44,598
I separate the root and choot tissues

173
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:46,478
and then I'm analyzing both root and

174
00:07:44,598 --> 00:07:49,199
Chute tissues for the two feric

175
00:07:46,478 --> 00:07:53,719
reductase enzymes I mentioned previously

176
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:56,840
in braip Podium using rtqpcr

177
00:07:53,720 --> 00:08:00,159
these are the results from the reduction

178
00:07:56,839 --> 00:08:02,478
mechanism for my preliminary trials

179
00:08:00,158 --> 00:08:06,598
these are reported in a rate so this is

180
00:08:02,478 --> 00:08:12,360
an amount of metal that is reduced per

181
00:08:06,598 --> 00:08:14,839
root weight over time on the left you

182
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:16,479
have your copper reduction on the right

183
00:08:14,839 --> 00:08:18,878
there's iron reduction and all three

184
00:08:16,478 --> 00:08:21,439
treatments and what we can basically say

185
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:24,639
from this data is that the plants that

186
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:28,079
are experiencing mineral deficiency are

187
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:30,879
not actively reducing more Metals in

188
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:32,639
either the copper or the iron assay

189
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:36,519
compared with the

190
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:40,399
control my transcriptional results show

191
00:08:36,519 --> 00:08:42,879
that the back bodium fro1 Gene is really

192
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:45,519
not being expressed in the root tissues

193
00:08:42,879 --> 00:08:47,838
but the braip podium fro2 Gene is

194
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:49,919
expressed there isn't a significant

195
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:52,160
difference in the expression of this

196
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:54,360
enzyme between the control and the minus

197
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:55,838
copper conditions but there is a

198
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:58,159
significant difference between the

199
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:59,839
control and the minus iron conditions

200
00:08:58,159 --> 00:09:02,078
plants grown in minus iron iron

201
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:03,959
conditions are expressing significantly

202
00:09:02,078 --> 00:09:07,958
less of this

203
00:09:03,958 --> 00:09:10,278
enzyme so taken together the reduction

204
00:09:07,958 --> 00:09:13,239
response data and the transcriptional

205
00:09:10,278 --> 00:09:15,559
data support each other to show that in

206
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:19,399
the roots of rup Podium this reduction

207
00:09:15,559 --> 00:09:21,639
response is not responding strongly to

208
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:24,240
Copper or iron

209
00:09:21,639 --> 00:09:28,159
deficiency interestingly what we found

210
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:32,000
in the chot tissue is a more Dynamic

211
00:09:28,159 --> 00:09:34,199
response to these deficiencies in

212
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:38,200
photosynthetic tissues so braip Podium

213
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:41,800
fro1 is expressed in choot tissues it's

214
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:44,600
expressed with increasing um the

215
00:09:41,799 --> 00:09:47,278
transcripts have increasing expression

216
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:49,360
under minus iron conditions and possibly

217
00:09:47,278 --> 00:09:52,278
minus copper although my sample set's a

218
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:55,839
bit small and braip Podium pro2 is

219
00:09:52,278 --> 00:09:57,759
expressed at lower rates compared to

220
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:59,800
control when plants experience

221
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:01,759
deficiency we think that this has

222
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:04,240
something to do with the plants trying

223
00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:05,679
to relocate the essential nutrients that

224
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,600
they have in their photosynthetic

225
00:10:05,679 --> 00:10:09,639
tissues when they're experiencing

226
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:11,720
deficiency they're moving them into

227
00:10:09,639 --> 00:10:14,039
photosynthesizing tissues to ensure that

228
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:16,160
they can continue to photosynthesize

229
00:10:14,039 --> 00:10:18,639
under deficiency

230
00:10:16,159 --> 00:10:20,559
conditions returning to the roots which

231
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:24,360
is what we really care about here right

232
00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:27,000
now my preliminary results indicate that

233
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:29,360
rodium dakon does not respond strongly

234
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:32,159
to copper deficiency with this reduction

235
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:34,039
based mechanism and for that reason we

236
00:10:32,159 --> 00:10:36,559
believe it is not the primary uptake

237
00:10:34,039 --> 00:10:38,599
mechanism in grasses this allows me to

238
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:41,278
move to my second chapter where I'm

239
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:44,079
exploring the culation based mechanism

240
00:10:41,278 --> 00:10:46,320
less is known about this mechanism so I

241
00:10:44,078 --> 00:10:49,039
have two objectives here I first want to

242
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:51,639
determine the capacity of associated

243
00:10:49,039 --> 00:10:54,838
Transporters in this mechanism to move

244
00:10:51,639 --> 00:10:57,000
copper across the plasma membrane then I

245
00:10:54,839 --> 00:11:00,160
want to analyze the response of the

246
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:02,720
keate based reduction keate based uptake

247
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:05,719
mechanism to copper deficiency in these

248
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:08,680
grasses I'm again using braip

249
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:11,680
Podium so here's a more detailed

250
00:11:08,679 --> 00:11:14,439
explanation of the culation based

251
00:11:11,679 --> 00:11:18,719
mechanism on the left this time you have

252
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:21,000
the soil with this insoluble iron and on

253
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:24,720
the right you have the cytool inside of

254
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:27,839
the plant root cells in this

255
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:30,480
mechanism mugic acids have to first be

256
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:33,600
synthesized within the plant in order

257
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:36,079
for that to happen these enzymes need to

258
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:38,200
be present and these enzymes are only

259
00:11:36,078 --> 00:11:40,879
expressed in grasses this is a very

260
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:43,200
special mechanism that only grasses have

261
00:11:40,879 --> 00:11:45,078
so they synthesize these mugic acids

262
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:48,360
which you're seen as this squiggly

263
00:11:45,078 --> 00:11:52,000
organic molecule with an acadine on it

264
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:54,000
then this mugic acid U molecule is

265
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:57,320
exported to the rizosphere through this

266
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:01,159
transporter it interacts with oxidized

267
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:03,440
metal creates a key complex wraps around

268
00:12:01,159 --> 00:12:05,719
the metal and then the entire keyate

269
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:09,200
complex is brought back into the root

270
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:09,200
cell by these Ys

271
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:13,680
Transporters our hypothesis in this

272
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:16,278
chapter is that the culation based

273
00:12:13,679 --> 00:12:18,559
uptake mechanism will facilitate copper

274
00:12:16,278 --> 00:12:22,320
attainment and will respond to copper

275
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:25,119
deficiency in braip Podium I will again

276
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:27,278
be growing these plants in hydroponic

277
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:29,600
solution so I can induce these

278
00:12:27,278 --> 00:12:31,958
deficiencies but this is my propos

279
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:35,240
uptake pathway for these

280
00:12:31,958 --> 00:12:37,919
grasses so these mugic acids are

281
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:39,879
specifically identified as braip Podium

282
00:12:37,919 --> 00:12:42,719
products these are the ones that this

283
00:12:39,879 --> 00:12:44,879
plant makes these are the specific braip

284
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:48,000
Podium Transporters that are orthologues

285
00:12:44,879 --> 00:12:51,000
to the system I just showed and in my

286
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:53,320
hypothesized pathway these mugic acids

287
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,039
are facilitating copper uptake through

288
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:56,519
these

289
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:59,599
Transporters and this project was funded

290
00:12:56,519 --> 00:13:01,799
by the Snips uh small grants program in

291
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:03,240
collaboration with Patty Lea very

292
00:13:01,799 --> 00:13:05,919
grateful for that

293
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:07,959
opportunity so the methods of analysis

294
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:11,679
after these plants are cultivated in

295
00:13:07,958 --> 00:13:14,879
hydroponic Solutions I'll be starting by

296
00:13:11,679 --> 00:13:17,399
looking at the mugic acid quantity for

297
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:20,838
those particular compounds I just showed

298
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:23,159
you that will be collected from Roots

299
00:13:20,839 --> 00:13:25,720
they will be Quantified using high

300
00:13:23,159 --> 00:13:28,719
performance liquid chromatography Mass

301
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:30,600
Spec I will then use the same method

302
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:33,560
icri descried in the previous chapter

303
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:35,720
rtqpcr but in this case I'm going to be

304
00:13:33,559 --> 00:13:38,078
quantifying the expression of the two

305
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:40,360
Transporters that I just showed you that

306
00:13:38,078 --> 00:13:41,120
are specific to this system sorry about

307
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:44,079
the

308
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:47,240
microphone finally the really cool part

309
00:13:44,078 --> 00:13:50,278
about the collaboration we are going to

310
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:53,720
heterologously express this BD ys1

311
00:13:50,278 --> 00:13:55,799
transporter in an oite system and use

312
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:57,560
electrophysiological techniques to

313
00:13:55,799 --> 00:14:00,120
establish the capacity of this

314
00:13:57,559 --> 00:14:01,879
transporter to move ER through a plasma

315
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:03,639
membrane I'll be doing this through my

316
00:14:01,879 --> 00:14:05,439
collaboration with the petto lab and

317
00:14:03,639 --> 00:14:09,079
Patty

318
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:10,600
laa moving on to chapter 3 where I'm

319
00:14:09,078 --> 00:14:13,359
going to be looking at the impact of

320
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:15,680
soil characteristics on copper uptake

321
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:18,399
mechanisms specifically I want to think

322
00:14:15,679 --> 00:14:20,479
about how pH microbial Community

323
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:23,399
Dynamics soil organic matter and

324
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:26,759
minerology are impacting the efficiency

325
00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:29,440
of these uptake mechanisms in

326
00:14:26,759 --> 00:14:31,519
grasses my hypothesis here is that the

327
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:34,279
grasses are not expressing one or

328
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:36,919
another mechanism they have all of these

329
00:14:34,278 --> 00:14:39,198
genes I believe they're expressing

330
00:14:36,919 --> 00:14:41,679
multiple mechanisms but that they are

331
00:14:39,198 --> 00:14:44,278
able to rely on the mechanism best

332
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:47,000
suited to their surroundings this

333
00:14:44,278 --> 00:14:49,838
improves the efficiency and allows in

334
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,879
this case braip Podium tachon to utilize

335
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:54,880
the most efficient mechanism for copper

336
00:14:51,879 --> 00:14:57,120
uptake based on its

337
00:14:54,879 --> 00:14:59,039
surroundings order to evaluate this

338
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:01,278
hypothesis I needed to take my

339
00:14:59,039 --> 00:15:04,958
hydroponic system to a more realistic

340
00:15:01,278 --> 00:15:07,679
level so I started off with soil I

341
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:10,039
collected ton of soil samples that were

342
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:12,519
being cultivated by from fields that

343
00:15:10,039 --> 00:15:15,078
were cultivated by the Sorel wheat lab

344
00:15:12,519 --> 00:15:16,639
where they are growing a mix of wheat

345
00:15:15,078 --> 00:15:19,159
barley and

346
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:22,278
Rye out of the soils that I collected

347
00:15:19,159 --> 00:15:25,360
and analyzed I chose three I chose the

348
00:15:22,278 --> 00:15:27,958
Caldwell and mewan soils which are being

349
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:31,519
cultivated in more conventional

350
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:33,919
agricultural methods and the Freeville

351
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:34,679
organic farm using more organic methods

352
00:15:33,919 --> 00:15:36,958
for

353
00:15:34,679 --> 00:15:39,719
cultivation all of these soils are

354
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:42,439
poorly drained they all are part of the

355
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:45,120
same taxonomy but they have different

356
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:47,959
estimated soil series and importantly

357
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:52,720
they have a wide range of pH so the pH

358
00:15:47,958 --> 00:15:55,078
ranges from 6.5 to 7.9 in these soils

359
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:57,680
see it on this side

360
00:15:55,078 --> 00:15:59,838
too so this difference is one of the

361
00:15:57,679 --> 00:16:01,399
things that I wanted to valate in these

362
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:04,959
different

363
00:16:01,399 --> 00:16:09,480
soils I also performed Elemental

364
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:11,638
analysis on these soils using uh icpms

365
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:13,879
what I'm showing here is total iron and

366
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:16,198
total alumina concentrations in these

367
00:16:13,879 --> 00:16:18,240
three soils which are significantly

368
00:16:16,198 --> 00:16:20,198
different indicating they may have

369
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:23,879
differences in mineraly but we still

370
00:16:20,198 --> 00:16:26,758
need to establish that I also did L on

371
00:16:23,879 --> 00:16:29,278
ignition to estimate total soil organic

372
00:16:26,759 --> 00:16:32,440
matter percent and I did find some

373
00:16:29,278 --> 00:16:35,360
significant differences so Freeville had

374
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:37,480
higher concentrations of soil organic

375
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:39,079
matter which could be related to the

376
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:41,519
management

377
00:16:39,078 --> 00:16:43,599
techniques interestingly I did not find

378
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:45,720
a lot of difference in the total copper

379
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:48,319
concentration and this is actually good

380
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:50,480
for me because I want to try to move my

381
00:16:48,318 --> 00:16:52,360
system into something more realistic so

382
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:54,879
I want to add copper to some of these

383
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:57,278
soils and see how the plants respond

384
00:16:54,879 --> 00:17:00,399
under these different conditions in

385
00:16:57,278 --> 00:17:03,759
order to do that I sent Iz a mineral

386
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:07,199
copper oxide nanop particle Amendment so

387
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:10,000
these are just really tiny tenorite

388
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:12,759
minerals they are an average diameter of

389
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,640
9 to 11 nanometers which was confirmed

390
00:17:12,759 --> 00:17:17,240
via xrd and

391
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:19,000
temm and they are confirmed monoclinic

392
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:22,160
tenorite

393
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:25,000
product so I want to apply these

394
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:28,199
nanoparticles in the soils but I needed

395
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:30,440
to know can the plants actually get to

396
00:17:28,199 --> 00:17:33,200
this coer in this

397
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:35,880
mineral so I started doing some trials

398
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:38,840
with the nanop particles I applied them

399
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:41,480
in Cornel mix and grew plants in the

400
00:17:38,839 --> 00:17:44,918
wild Hall growth chamber I specifically

401
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:47,679
grew a copper deficient mutant plant

402
00:17:44,919 --> 00:17:50,480
that was developed in the vat manuk lab

403
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:53,600
this is really sensitive to low copper

404
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:56,759
concentrations and this plant in the

405
00:17:53,599 --> 00:17:59,079
typical lab practice is fertilized with

406
00:17:56,759 --> 00:18:01,359
copper sulfate so just a little solution

407
00:17:59,079 --> 00:18:05,119
as opposed to a mineral I used this

408
00:18:01,359 --> 00:18:06,479
copper sulfate as a control treatment

409
00:18:05,119 --> 00:18:08,599
and then I added different

410
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:10,960
concentrations of copper oxide nanop

411
00:18:08,599 --> 00:18:13,879
particles and I found that the flowering

412
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:15,919
response was rescued in this mutant

413
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:18,080
above about two parts per million copper

414
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:20,759
oxide nanop particle

415
00:18:18,079 --> 00:18:23,038
Amendment but that didn't really tell me

416
00:18:20,759 --> 00:18:25,158
where the copper was going either in the

417
00:18:23,038 --> 00:18:26,960
soil or in the plants so I wanted to

418
00:18:25,159 --> 00:18:29,480
understand

419
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:31,720
distribution in order to do that

420
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:36,279
I went over to the Cornell high energy

421
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:39,880
syncron facility where we carried out a

422
00:18:36,279 --> 00:18:43,079
collaboration using these Riso boxes to

423
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:45,640
live image plants interacting with the

424
00:18:43,079 --> 00:18:49,199
nanoparticle treated

425
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:52,480
soil and these are the results from that

426
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:54,640
experiment so down here on the bottom we

427
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:57,519
look at this one down here on the bottom

428
00:18:54,640 --> 00:19:00,559
we have a zero treatment here so no

429
00:18:57,519 --> 00:19:02,119
addition of copper this is our control

430
00:19:00,558 --> 00:19:05,558
and then the three in the middle are

431
00:19:02,119 --> 00:19:08,279
copper oxide nanoparticle treated soils

432
00:19:05,558 --> 00:19:10,839
this is the same order that you see here

433
00:19:08,279 --> 00:19:13,119
and you can see that as you increase the

434
00:19:10,839 --> 00:19:15,839
treatment of nanop particles there's

435
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:18,399
more accumulation of copper not just in

436
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:20,599
the soil but in the actual root

437
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:22,200
tissue what I found was that it wasn't

438
00:19:20,599 --> 00:19:25,038
just the root tissue it was also the

439
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:28,080
Chute tissue moving up in concentration

440
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:30,119
of treatment here these are leaves these

441
00:19:28,079 --> 00:19:32,079
stripes are are the actual vasculature

442
00:19:30,119 --> 00:19:34,719
within those leaves so we're seeing

443
00:19:32,079 --> 00:19:36,839
higher concentrations of copper in the

444
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:39,000
leaves of plants that were treated with

445
00:19:36,839 --> 00:19:40,918
these copper oxide nanop particles so

446
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,038
this confirmed the idea that the nanop

447
00:19:40,919 --> 00:19:44,759
particles were not only available to the

448
00:19:43,038 --> 00:19:47,038
plants but that they were getting the

449
00:19:44,759 --> 00:19:49,279
copper out and moving it through the

450
00:19:47,038 --> 00:19:49,279
plant

451
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:56,600
tissues I will also be using in this uh

452
00:19:54,159 --> 00:20:00,000
chapter of my dissertation a really

453
00:19:56,599 --> 00:20:02,279
important technique of multi collector

454
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,558
icpms I won't bore you with all the

455
00:20:02,279 --> 00:20:07,480
details but essentially this allows us

456
00:20:04,558 --> 00:20:11,599
to distinguish the primary copper uptake

457
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:14,079
mechanism by analyzing plant tissues we

458
00:20:11,599 --> 00:20:18,798
can analyze these plant tissues for the

459
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:21,158
specific stable isotope ratio for copper

460
00:20:18,798 --> 00:20:23,359
which doesn't change in a culation based

461
00:20:21,159 --> 00:20:26,159
system but if the plant is primarily

462
00:20:23,359 --> 00:20:29,319
using a reduction based mechanism for

463
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:31,640
copper uptake the reduction prefers the

464
00:20:29,319 --> 00:20:34,359
lighter isotope so that changes the

465
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:37,000
isotope ratio in the plant tissue and

466
00:20:34,359 --> 00:20:38,558
gives us a metric where we can look at

467
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,759
which mechanism is actually being

468
00:20:38,558 --> 00:20:44,000
favored based just off those copper

469
00:20:41,759 --> 00:20:46,519
Isotopes this will be very important for

470
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:49,000
this chapter other methods of analysis I

471
00:20:46,519 --> 00:20:51,240
plan to use I want to look at the

472
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:55,000
microbial Community Dynamics in these

473
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:58,079
soils using 16s amplion sequencing I'll

474
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:00,919
use rtqpcr metabolite analysis and the

475
00:20:58,079 --> 00:21:03,279
reductase essay assays mentioned

476
00:21:00,919 --> 00:21:05,200
previously to analyze the response of

477
00:21:03,279 --> 00:21:07,639
those particular

478
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:10,120
mechanisms so in summary if you take

479
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:12,159
nothing else away from this talk copper

480
00:21:10,119 --> 00:21:15,038
is essential and we don't know how it

481
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:17,240
gets into grasses in my dissertation I'm

482
00:21:15,038 --> 00:21:19,679
going to be looking at two established

483
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:21,880
fundamental uptake mechanisms and

484
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:24,038
determining if they are functioning in

485
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:26,880
these grasses if they are what's

486
00:21:24,038 --> 00:21:29,200
bringing the copper in and the response

487
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:31,559
of copper uptake mechanisms to different

488
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:34,240
soil conditions is going to be evaluated

489
00:21:31,558 --> 00:21:36,319
in pot studies using field soil as an

490
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:39,440
attempt to apply these fundamental

491
00:21:36,319 --> 00:21:43,519
concepts in a more realistic

492
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:45,320
way finally I want to thank my committee

493
00:21:43,519 --> 00:21:47,879
it has been so incredible to be

494
00:21:45,319 --> 00:21:50,439
co-advised and get to be part of two

495
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:52,480
amazing Labs it's been great for my

496
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:55,240
interdisciplinary experience and of

497
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:58,120
course thanks to all the people on this

498
00:21:55,240 --> 00:22:00,240

finally please check this out this is

500
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:05,200
the new XLE project at the Cornell high

501
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:07,480
energy syncron there are amazing

502
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:09,440
opportunities for biologists for soil

503
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:13,880
scientists this is going to be great for

504
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:13,880
us so take a look at that thank
