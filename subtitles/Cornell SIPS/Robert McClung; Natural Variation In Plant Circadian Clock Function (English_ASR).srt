1
00:00:00,549 --> 00:00:09,698
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,678 --> 00:00:12,339
University thank you very much Elena the

3
00:00:09,698 --> 00:00:16,118
one thing I actually spent a year

4
00:00:12,339 --> 00:00:22,390
working for the USDA to sew a finger in

5
00:00:16,118 --> 00:00:25,359
many pots okay so this first slide is to

6
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:28,868
characterize basically my good fortune I

7
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:30,460
was coming back from the earth within

8
00:00:28,868 --> 00:00:33,579
the arab adaxes meeting was in Beijing

9
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:35,469
and I had like 48 hours in Paris and so

10
00:00:33,579 --> 00:00:37,000
went to the Louvre and they had this

11
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:44,829
thing where they were taking modern art

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:47,829
and oh let's see if I got that and well

13
00:00:44,829 --> 00:00:49,840
I don't know this thing I'm what have I

14
00:00:47,829 --> 00:00:53,590
done here how can I have broken it

15
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:55,450
already so I've broken this already but

16
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:57,399
anyway baby juxtaposing modern art with

17
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:59,520
all the ancient stuff and I were

18
00:00:57,399 --> 00:01:03,910
actually on it one of those living

19
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:06,909
runways out of there yes and and we

20
00:01:03,909 --> 00:01:09,129
thought you know all these life-size of

21
00:01:06,909 --> 00:01:10,749
plaster of Paris people wearing lab

22
00:01:09,129 --> 00:01:12,879
coats and holding clocks and I thought

23
00:01:10,748 --> 00:01:14,349
this is just so perfect for my lab so we

24
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:16,239
actually had to go out and come back in

25
00:01:14,349 --> 00:01:18,038
so I could walk in there and take a

26
00:01:16,239 --> 00:01:21,658
picture of all these people so that is

27
00:01:18,039 --> 00:01:21,659
not a group meeting that's that's art

28
00:01:22,858 --> 00:01:29,559
okay so the reason for my fascination

29
00:01:27,968 --> 00:01:33,009
with clocks and the whole premise of the

30
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:34,329
field is is that a clock that matches

31
00:01:33,009 --> 00:01:36,519
the environmental oscillation will

32
00:01:34,328 --> 00:01:38,318
enhance Fitness because of course the

33
00:01:36,519 --> 00:01:40,810
rotation of the earth on its axis means

34
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:43,659
that life is evolved in a world where

35
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:45,939
the environment changes drastically day

36
00:01:43,659 --> 00:01:51,329
and night but completely predictably and

37
00:01:45,938 --> 00:01:54,809
so if the clock is an entity that allows

38
00:01:51,328 --> 00:01:58,568
the organism to coordinate its biology

39
00:01:54,810 --> 00:02:00,819
with this daily oscillation in the

40
00:01:58,569 --> 00:02:02,799
environment around it so that's what

41
00:02:00,819 --> 00:02:05,319
we're working on and and nowhere is this

42
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:07,090
better Illustrated than in this movie

43
00:02:05,319 --> 00:02:09,729
that some of you may have seen from us

44
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:12,789
Roger Han garter makes it this is this

45
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:14,050
is a sunflower plant growing in Rogers

46
00:02:12,789 --> 00:02:17,259
backyards

47
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:21,100
and this is the day in the life of this

48
00:02:17,259 --> 00:02:23,649
sunflower and and so this is east and

49
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:27,340
this is West and it's Indiana so not

50
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:29,230
much is going to happen but over time

51
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:31,120
the shadows will get longer and then it

52
00:02:29,229 --> 00:02:32,619
will be illuminated night the action is

53
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,629
all at night and it will be illuminated

54
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:36,250
by a single bulb overs backcourt but you

55
00:02:34,629 --> 00:02:37,990
can see the solar tracking it's been

56
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:40,990
tracking and keeping it leaves oriented

57
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:42,580
and now immediately it completely

58
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:45,820
reconfigures and there's sort of two

59
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:47,740
amazing things here one is it knows

60
00:02:45,819 --> 00:02:49,569
where the sun's going to come up and

61
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:51,070
where breakfast is going to be and it

62
00:02:49,569 --> 00:02:53,500
knows when it's going to happen and it's

63
00:02:51,069 --> 00:02:55,900
totally ready so this is the best

64
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:58,180
example of dawn anticipation that I have

65
00:02:55,900 --> 00:03:00,219
ever seen and and this is really what

66
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:04,990
clocks are about to enable you to

67
00:03:00,219 --> 00:03:07,120
anticipate what's coming next and adjust

68
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:10,629
your biology to be appropriate to what's

69
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:13,030
happening next now I would like to put

70
00:03:10,629 --> 00:03:15,849
this in particularly when it's not a

71
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:17,949
plant audience because I like to sort of

72
00:03:15,849 --> 00:03:19,959
poke the animal folks in the eye a bit

73
00:03:17,949 --> 00:03:21,579
but given that it's largely a plant

74
00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:23,400
audience this hopefully will make you

75
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:26,290
all feel better about yourselves

76
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:28,629
because plants feature almost entirely

77
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:30,519
the history of study of circadian

78
00:03:28,629 --> 00:03:32,979
rhythms is the study of plant circadian

79
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:35,320
rhythms in the Western canon at least

80
00:03:32,979 --> 00:03:37,329
the first writings on clocks are those

81
00:03:35,319 --> 00:03:39,039
of Indra Sinise who had subscribed went

82
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:40,930
off with Alexander the Great to define

83
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:43,929
and conquered the known world and he

84
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:46,450
observed leaf movement of a tree almost

85
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:48,939
certainly a tamarind on an island in the

86
00:03:46,449 --> 00:03:50,709
Red Sea now we call Bahrain there was no

87
00:03:48,939 --> 00:03:53,020
indication that they had any sense that

88
00:03:50,709 --> 00:03:54,939
this was an endogenous self-sustaining

89
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:57,370
leaf movement but this the first writing

90
00:03:54,939 --> 00:04:00,039
of science lived a little slower back

91
00:03:57,370 --> 00:04:01,870
then some two millennia later a French

92
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:04,810
astronomer finally did the experiment to

93
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:06,879
ask is this endogenous and he took a

94
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:09,009
sensitive heliotrope up almost 30 a

95
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:10,870
mimosa and just put it in the dark and

96
00:04:09,009 --> 00:04:15,069
asked did the sleep movements of the

97
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:18,189
leaves forces and they did he was quite

98
00:04:15,069 --> 00:04:20,259
prescient because he suggested there

99
00:04:18,189 --> 00:04:23,139
might be a relationship of this behavior

100
00:04:20,259 --> 00:04:25,539
in plants to the observed sleep

101
00:04:23,139 --> 00:04:27,399
behaviors in bedridden human patients

102
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:28,000
and hospitals and of course he was quite

103
00:04:27,399 --> 00:04:31,179
right but

104
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:35,170
product of the clock again science moved

105
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:36,699
slowly 30 years later to other authors

106
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:38,259
published books repeating those

107
00:04:36,699 --> 00:04:40,990
observations getting whole books out

108
00:04:38,259 --> 00:04:43,649
here but they excluded temperature as

109
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:47,560
having driven these rhythms and then

110
00:04:43,649 --> 00:04:50,319
finally a hundred eighty years later de

111
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:52,240
Kendall finally got quantitative up to

112
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:53,889
this point people had said okay leaves

113
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:57,519
are moving whatever they have a

114
00:04:53,889 --> 00:05:00,159
circadian period a daily period but

115
00:04:57,519 --> 00:05:02,139
finally de Cantel quantified the period

116
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:04,900
and determined that the freerunning curd

117
00:05:02,139 --> 00:05:08,139
was not precisely 24 hours in mimosa

118
00:05:04,899 --> 00:05:10,149
it's about 22 to 23 hours and and when I

119
00:05:08,139 --> 00:05:11,740
entered the field we were still at the

120
00:05:10,149 --> 00:05:13,870
end of a long debate with whether or not

121
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:17,860
there was such a thing as the circadian

122
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:19,509
clock or rather were these overt

123
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:22,270
phenotypes that people observed the

124
00:05:19,509 --> 00:05:25,360
result of some response to some subtle

125
00:05:22,269 --> 00:05:27,159
and undetected geophysical cue and of

126
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:29,590
course the answer came in here because

127
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:31,480
the period wasn't 24 hours so it

128
00:05:29,589 --> 00:05:32,949
couldn't have been a subtle geophysical

129
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:34,600
cue because that would have had a

130
00:05:32,949 --> 00:05:36,339
24-hour period like the rotation of the

131
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:38,260
earth on its axis so it had to be

132
00:05:36,339 --> 00:05:40,239
endogenous people still didn't believe

133
00:05:38,259 --> 00:05:42,279
until they finally puts an Arras weapon

134
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,168
Skylab removed it from the earth cycle

135
00:05:42,279 --> 00:05:46,359
and it continued to show its daily

136
00:05:44,168 --> 00:05:49,120
rhythm and consider Canady a ssin so uh

137
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:52,240
but up until now everything's all

138
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:55,209
implants and it wasn't until if it was

139
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:57,910
1898 when finally they observed rhythms

140
00:05:55,209 --> 00:06:01,228
and pigmentation and some crabs and they

141
00:05:57,910 --> 00:06:05,169
didn't observe rhythmic behavior in

142
00:06:01,228 --> 00:06:06,939
rodents rats and mice until about 1924

143
00:06:05,168 --> 00:06:08,228
or something like that so basically the

144
00:06:06,939 --> 00:06:09,969
history of clocks is the history of

145
00:06:08,228 --> 00:06:15,819
plant clocks and animals are recent

146
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:18,370
interlopers in plants basically whatever

147
00:06:15,819 --> 00:06:20,290
you're doing there's a good chance that

148
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:22,990
there will be an influence of time of

149
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:25,180
day on that phenomenon which is really

150
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:28,720
an inconvenient truth but it's my

151
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:32,129
assertion to you and so we know that a

152
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:34,720
growth responses elongation growth

153
00:06:32,129 --> 00:06:36,728
happens it's gated two particular times

154
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:39,099
a day there are many examples of

155
00:06:36,728 --> 00:06:41,110
metabolic gating of course we know the

156
00:06:39,098 --> 00:06:42,519
clock influences for the periodic

157
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:44,800
flowering

158
00:06:42,519 --> 00:06:47,049
and and and recent events and I'll show

159
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,939
a couple of examples that have provided

160
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:51,550
evidence that the ability to mount to

161
00:06:48,939 --> 00:06:54,129
receive and mount a response to biotic

162
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:55,629
or abiotic stresses can be a function of

163
00:06:54,129 --> 00:06:58,210
the time of day at which that stress is

164
00:06:55,629 --> 00:07:02,139
encountered so they're really quite

165
00:06:58,209 --> 00:07:04,029
pervasive do rhythms matter I want to

166
00:07:02,139 --> 00:07:06,879
give you two examples where they do

167
00:07:04,029 --> 00:07:08,709
matter the first I think is in many ways

168
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:10,720
the coolest this is words from Alexander

169
00:07:08,709 --> 00:07:13,180
Graff who was a student with Allison

170
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:16,180
Smith and it has to do with starch

171
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:18,879
metabolism basically a rabbit ops Asst

172
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:20,740
stores it's photosynthesis excess

173
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:23,139
photosynthate in the day as starch and

174
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:26,348
then at night degrades that to provide

175
00:07:23,139 --> 00:07:28,269
carbon for growth or respiration and and

176
00:07:26,348 --> 00:07:30,728
of course it would be bad if you burned

177
00:07:28,269 --> 00:07:34,149
it all up and ran out what happens is

178
00:07:30,728 --> 00:07:35,829
that at dusk the plant makes a

179
00:07:34,149 --> 00:07:38,978
calculation how much starch should I

180
00:07:35,829 --> 00:07:41,258
accumulate today Consultants a clock and

181
00:07:38,978 --> 00:07:43,598
anticipates when Don is going to be and

182
00:07:41,259 --> 00:07:46,629
adjusts its starch degradation rates to

183
00:07:43,598 --> 00:07:49,538
be linear such that starch reserves are

184
00:07:46,629 --> 00:07:53,098
just about but not quite exhausted at

185
00:07:49,538 --> 00:07:56,560
dawn if you full it by a delaying dawn

186
00:07:53,098 --> 00:07:58,750
the plant does this linear burn runs out

187
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:01,839
of starch induces a carbon starvation

188
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:05,860
response and and growth falls off

189
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:08,258
dramatically so so here's one great

190
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:11,590
example that may be why it's important

191
00:08:08,259 --> 00:08:13,658
to have a clock to do this calculation

192
00:08:11,589 --> 00:08:15,250
and and of course the title of one of

193
00:08:13,658 --> 00:08:18,668
the reviews was plants do arithmetic

194
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:20,139
division I just love that the other one

195
00:08:18,668 --> 00:08:24,598
here's another one for those of you who

196
00:08:20,139 --> 00:08:29,408
like caterpillars so cabbage loopers

197
00:08:24,598 --> 00:08:31,389
like to devour rabid Oxus and so a good

198
00:08:29,408 --> 00:08:33,870
speed at all in Jennifer Anne's lab did

199
00:08:31,389 --> 00:08:36,729
some totally cool experiment they

200
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:38,440
entrained the loopers in the plants in

201
00:08:36,729 --> 00:08:40,028
phase with one another so they both

202
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:42,490
think days when day is and there's an

203
00:08:40,028 --> 00:08:44,708
activity rhythm and a feeding rhythm the

204
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:47,500
the troika blue C&amp;E are active during

205
00:08:44,708 --> 00:08:49,028
the daytime and and if they're in phase

206
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:52,120
with the plants everybody thinks it's

207
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:54,070
daytime and and there's some or bibury

208
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:55,580
and some growth of the loopers but the

209
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:58,850
plants survive if

210
00:08:55,580 --> 00:09:00,230
however you would train the plants and

211
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:02,899
the loopers out of phase with one

212
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:04,460
another such that the looper is active

213
00:09:02,899 --> 00:09:07,509
when it thinks it's day but the presence

214
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:10,490
at night the plants are devastated and

215
00:09:07,509 --> 00:09:13,009
and and the loopers proliferate and get

216
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:15,139
big and fat and and of course now what

217
00:09:13,009 --> 00:09:17,899
we know is they're cycling jazz monic

218
00:09:15,139 --> 00:09:20,149
acid levels and and the planet of course

219
00:09:17,899 --> 00:09:22,759
there's a trade-off between defense and

220
00:09:20,149 --> 00:09:24,919
growth and the plant is just making j:a

221
00:09:22,759 --> 00:09:26,779
when it anticipates the activity rhythm

222
00:09:24,919 --> 00:09:28,879
of the looper and it seems if you

223
00:09:26,779 --> 00:09:30,439
disrupt that relationship it's bad news

224
00:09:28,879 --> 00:09:33,080
for the plants so here are two examples

225
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:35,480
but there are many many other examples I

226
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:37,730
mean we don't know exactly there's no

227
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:39,379
one thing you can look at and say this

228
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:41,840
is why clocks enhancefitness

229
00:09:39,379 --> 00:09:43,759
so far it's probably an incremental

230
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:46,160
improvement on lots of different

231
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:48,830
processes and it you know which you

232
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:50,269
think is most important what do we call

233
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:51,680
that an ascertain meant by assits

234
00:09:50,269 --> 00:09:53,439
whatever you think is important and you

235
00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:56,029
can look at it and you'll find it may be

236
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:58,280
so to define some terms

237
00:09:56,029 --> 00:10:00,769
so circadian the term means that's from

238
00:09:58,279 --> 00:10:03,169
the latin approximately a circuit

239
00:10:00,769 --> 00:10:04,189
approximately da so these are rhythms

240
00:10:03,169 --> 00:10:06,319
that have a period length of

241
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:08,240
approximately but not exactly 24 hours

242
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,800
and they're endogenous they persist in

243
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,690
the absence of environmental time cues

244
00:10:09,799 --> 00:10:14,149
but of course we live in a world that's

245
00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:17,660
replete with environmental time cues and

246
00:10:14,149 --> 00:10:19,549
so clocks are entrain about to

247
00:10:17,659 --> 00:10:21,379
environmental time cues keep chiefly

248
00:10:19,549 --> 00:10:25,339
light-dark cycles but also temperature

249
00:10:21,379 --> 00:10:27,350
cycles in the case of you folks most of

250
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:29,810
whom I think are humans if you fly to

251
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:31,370
Japan you're going to be jet-lagged the

252
00:10:29,809 --> 00:10:33,199
light-dark cycles take a walk at noon

253
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:35,950
that'll help you in train but also

254
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:38,240
social cues taking your meals on time

255
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:39,860
having a beer at the end of the day all

256
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:44,870
these sorts of social tools will help to

257
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:46,580
entrain your clock so just see a couple

258
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:48,740
of terms that I'll mention a bit I won't

259
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:50,870
mention amplitude much that it's your

260
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:53,419
sine wave physics from from high school

261
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:56,210
half the peak to trough distance is one

262
00:10:53,419 --> 00:10:58,129
amplitude in a training conditions when

263
00:10:56,210 --> 00:11:01,430
we're providing a light dark cycle the

264
00:10:58,129 --> 00:11:02,750
period will be entrained to 24 hours if

265
00:11:01,429 --> 00:11:04,549
you're released into continuous

266
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:05,960
conditions the gray is when the lights

267
00:11:04,549 --> 00:11:08,299
would have gone off had they gone off

268
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:09,440
you'll see revealed the freerunning

269
00:11:08,299 --> 00:11:12,458
period in this example

270
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:15,620
a little longer than 24 about 25 hours

271
00:11:12,458 --> 00:11:17,539
so traditionally we thought about the

272
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:19,818
clock in sort of a linear cascade

273
00:11:17,539 --> 00:11:21,439
there's a clock it's in trained through

274
00:11:19,818 --> 00:11:23,628
input pathways like temperature

275
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:25,550
imbibition in this case I mean that

276
00:11:23,629 --> 00:11:27,319
hydration of the seed but that's the

277
00:11:25,549 --> 00:11:29,809
social cues of taking a beer on time

278
00:11:27,318 --> 00:11:31,759
will help you in trace and then their

279
00:11:29,809 --> 00:11:32,989
output rhythms gene expression I'll talk

280
00:11:31,759 --> 00:11:34,370
about I'll talk a lot about leaf

281
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:37,730
movements the mental aperture other

282
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:39,379
things but this linear pathway is not

283
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:41,800
sufficient to think about this because

284
00:11:39,379 --> 00:11:45,319
we know there's dating that is the plant

285
00:11:41,799 --> 00:11:48,169
through clock regulated expression for

286
00:11:45,318 --> 00:11:51,740
example of phytochromes modulates its

287
00:11:48,169 --> 00:11:53,269
own sensitivity to light so and we can

288
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:55,579
think about that with a plant but also

289
00:11:53,269 --> 00:11:58,370
with us a pulse of light applied to you

290
00:11:55,578 --> 00:12:00,438
at noon doesn't affect your clock of

291
00:11:58,370 --> 00:12:01,938
course cursors light at noon but that

292
00:12:00,438 --> 00:12:03,980
same pulse of light applied to you in

293
00:12:01,938 --> 00:12:05,838
the pre-dawn hours you think oh my

294
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:08,329
goodness I've overslept the click the

295
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:11,000
light Sun lights a run already and you

296
00:12:08,328 --> 00:12:13,250
advance your clock to match what you've

297
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,990
now perceived as a new dawn that same

298
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:17,059
pulse of light applied to you after dusk

299
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:18,379
you think oh I thought the Sun went down

300
00:12:17,059 --> 00:12:21,799
but it just went down again and you

301
00:12:18,379 --> 00:12:23,720
delay your clock so so it's very

302
00:12:21,799 --> 00:12:26,328
contextual it's time of day dependent

303
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:30,439
that's this gating phenomenon in

304
00:12:26,328 --> 00:12:33,198
addition many of the output pathways

305
00:12:30,438 --> 00:12:35,328
have intermediates and it's now becoming

306
00:12:33,198 --> 00:12:36,979
clear in a number of ways that various

307
00:12:35,328 --> 00:12:38,419
intermediates in these output path

308
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:40,699
weights metabolites like sugars

309
00:12:38,419 --> 00:12:44,448
nutrients like organic nitrogen iron

310
00:12:40,698 --> 00:12:46,549
copper are actually feeding back again

311
00:12:44,448 --> 00:12:47,659
to modulate clock function and so if

312
00:12:46,549 --> 00:12:49,008
you're setting up all these to be

313
00:12:47,659 --> 00:12:50,328
appropriate at time of day and they're

314
00:12:49,009 --> 00:12:53,509
interacting with the rest of the

315
00:12:50,328 --> 00:12:56,149
organism of course you're monitoring key

316
00:12:53,509 --> 00:12:58,818
metabolites to try and fine-tune the

317
00:12:56,149 --> 00:13:01,458
clock so so it's not a linear pathway at

318
00:12:58,818 --> 00:13:03,259
all it's a network pathway and you have

319
00:13:01,458 --> 00:13:05,179
to think of the the clock I think as an

320
00:13:03,259 --> 00:13:06,800
integrator of cellular metabolism and

321
00:13:05,179 --> 00:13:09,429
organismal physiology at least that's

322
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:13,278
the way I'm trying to think about it

323
00:13:09,429 --> 00:13:15,620
work from a lot of labs among them that

324
00:13:13,278 --> 00:13:18,799
of Steve Kay in a rabbit offices have

325
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:20,990
done a long way towards defining the

326
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:22,639
architecture and the components and the

327
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:23,209
interrelationships of these components

328
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:27,769
in

329
00:13:23,208 --> 00:13:29,599
and the plant clock and so uh like all

330
00:13:27,769 --> 00:13:31,669
these complicated machines it gets

331
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:34,879
complex and then people simplify that it

332
00:13:31,669 --> 00:13:36,618
gets complex again we're in a period of

333
00:13:34,879 --> 00:13:38,240
slight simplification but basically

334
00:13:36,619 --> 00:13:40,519
there are a whole bunch of transcription

335
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:44,749
factors most of which are repressors at

336
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:46,938
dawn cca1 and LH y2 single mid doing

337
00:13:44,749 --> 00:13:48,769
transcription factors are abundant and

338
00:13:46,938 --> 00:13:51,769
they repress a whole bunch of other

339
00:13:48,769 --> 00:13:53,360
things so there's this morning component

340
00:13:51,769 --> 00:13:54,919
they're also evening components and

341
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:56,869
these are arrayed according to times of

342
00:13:54,919 --> 00:13:59,838
day so there's an evening complex and

343
00:13:56,869 --> 00:14:02,480
talk 1 and and these guys are also

344
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:04,699
repressors what happens is after a

345
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:08,569
period of time certain transcriptional

346
00:14:04,698 --> 00:14:10,998
activators turn on this bridging group

347
00:14:08,568 --> 00:14:13,938
and they turn off this and and so on and

348
00:14:10,999 --> 00:14:16,040
you with all this interrelated on/off

349
00:14:13,938 --> 00:14:17,328
you can build up a stable 24-hour

350
00:14:16,039 --> 00:14:19,549
oscillation with these feedback loops

351
00:14:17,328 --> 00:14:22,219
and and depending on your love of

352
00:14:19,549 --> 00:14:25,008
complexity you can add way more arrows

353
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:29,028
and more components to this and it does

354
00:14:25,009 --> 00:14:32,688
look a little bit like a hairball so the

355
00:14:29,028 --> 00:14:36,948
real question now to me well one of the

356
00:14:32,688 --> 00:14:39,678
real questions is is rapid ops is a good

357
00:14:36,948 --> 00:14:43,998
model can we take this and move it in to

358
00:14:39,678 --> 00:14:46,188
apply it to other plants and so that was

359
00:14:43,999 --> 00:14:47,689
a challenge in particularly I didn't

360
00:14:46,188 --> 00:14:49,428
really want to take on that challenge

361
00:14:47,688 --> 00:14:53,688
but of course when the plant genome

362
00:14:49,428 --> 00:14:56,419
project got going at the NSF plant

363
00:14:53,688 --> 00:14:58,698
genome means any plant genome except for

364
00:14:56,419 --> 00:15:00,948
that of a rabbit abscess and so I needed

365
00:14:58,698 --> 00:15:03,078
to if I wanted to get money I needed to

366
00:15:00,948 --> 00:15:05,389
find a crop and my friend and

367
00:15:03,078 --> 00:15:07,328
collaborator Cynthia Lennox said got the

368
00:15:05,389 --> 00:15:09,589
system for you I found a great

369
00:15:07,328 --> 00:15:12,438
population of hominid ate bread lines

370
00:15:09,589 --> 00:15:14,240
and Brassica Rapa and so said ok let's

371
00:15:12,438 --> 00:15:16,969
put in a grant to work on that we did

372
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:18,169
and got funded and so now many years

373
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:20,629
later we're still working on it

374
00:15:18,169 --> 00:15:23,118
so transition to a crop Brassica Rapa

375
00:15:20,629 --> 00:15:25,759
it's just it's it's a rabid office on

376
00:15:23,119 --> 00:15:28,129
steroids rabid offices flower abrasca

377
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:31,699
flower a rabbit out succeed braska seed

378
00:15:28,129 --> 00:15:34,100
rabbit up cecilia braska seedling so its

379
00:15:31,698 --> 00:15:35,328
bigger but it's very similar and then

380
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:37,070
there are a couple of other twists will

381
00:15:35,328 --> 00:15:39,589
come up it's a cult

382
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:41,990
big drop napa cabbage turnip chinese

383
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:43,940
cabbage it's highly play morphic show

384
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:45,680
you slide on that later but also an

385
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:48,920
invasive weed but of course it related

386
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:50,870
to a rabbit opposites but also to maybe

387
00:15:48,919 --> 00:15:53,689
a mega crop like being Canadian of

388
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:58,039
course canola so we thought this was a

389
00:15:53,690 --> 00:16:00,070
good place to start and and oh yeah I

390
00:15:58,039 --> 00:16:02,509
didn't really realize at the time but

391
00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:04,220
Brassica Rapa doesn't transform terribly

392
00:16:02,509 --> 00:16:07,009
well and that's really a limitation but

393
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:09,259
we wanted a nice non-invasive

394
00:16:07,009 --> 00:16:11,000
non-transgenic assay and for that we

395
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:13,759
went back to the assay that drove

396
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:16,789
circadian rhythm research for many

397
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:19,700
millennia that is leaf movement and so

398
00:16:16,789 --> 00:16:23,509
uh this abrasca seedling and this is

399
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:25,070
what these guys do just the leaves go up

400
00:16:23,509 --> 00:16:29,120
and down once a day for the cotyledons

401
00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:30,470
the true leaves do as well and I'll come

402
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:33,019
back to this later but we wanted to

403
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:34,639
greatly enhance our true put when we

404
00:16:33,019 --> 00:16:37,610
first did our first recombinant inbred

405
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:39,559
line population was 150 lines we did it

406
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:43,100
three temperatures and that's a tree

407
00:16:39,559 --> 00:16:45,139
postdoc years and uh what we wanted to

408
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:46,970
do was scale up and steal from that

409
00:16:45,139 --> 00:16:48,949
buckler's playbook and start looking at

410
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:51,080
nested Association napping populations

411
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:52,850
and look at more and so we went through

412
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:54,379
a thousand and fifty genotypes and I

413
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:55,610
didn't have like thirty postdoc years

414
00:16:54,379 --> 00:16:57,769
there was no way that was going to

415
00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:59,330
happen so we had to streamline the

416
00:16:57,769 --> 00:17:02,509
analytic pipeline and the problem is

417
00:16:59,330 --> 00:17:05,000
there's just too much operator input and

418
00:17:02,509 --> 00:17:07,039
so I went to a friend of mine this guy

419
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:10,039
here honey Farid who is chair of our

420
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:12,230
computer science department and I said

421
00:17:10,039 --> 00:17:14,720
honey I know in your deep dark past you

422
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:17,059
did automated motion detection you have

423
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:19,220
any code that can help us with this and

424
00:17:17,059 --> 00:17:22,419
he said he thought he could and so he

425
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:25,250
wrote this great code uh that basically

426
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:27,019
takes successive frames a pixel and

427
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:29,869
draws a motion vector from where that

428
00:17:27,019 --> 00:17:31,879
pixel is in frame one for a man to where

429
00:17:29,869 --> 00:17:33,439
it is in print n plus one and that's

430
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:35,210
what these blue lines are these motion

431
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:38,900
vectors going from frame to frame and

432
00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:41,360
then you simply sum all the vectors at

433
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:45,470
each interval and then you can plot out

434
00:17:41,359 --> 00:17:48,169
a motion and it's totally uh it's a user

435
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:50,720
free I just click one button and you get

436
00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:54,940
the whole thing back from all your

437
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:59,118
plants so uh if we go

438
00:17:54,940 --> 00:18:02,509
honey I want you back uh so we plot that

439
00:17:59,118 --> 00:18:04,519
out you get nice automated digital

440
00:18:02,509 --> 00:18:06,378
readout that's quantitative and we can

441
00:18:04,519 --> 00:18:08,808
then do a Fourier transform and extract

442
00:18:06,378 --> 00:18:12,079
the rhythmic parameters on that and so

443
00:18:08,808 --> 00:18:13,398
up here are traces from the two parents

444
00:18:12,079 --> 00:18:16,489
of this recombinant inbred line

445
00:18:13,398 --> 00:18:17,808
population um this one is much taller

446
00:18:16,489 --> 00:18:21,019
and as you can see it's growing very

447
00:18:17,808 --> 00:18:22,848
quickly but basically they look pretty

448
00:18:21,019 --> 00:18:25,759
similar they go up and down once a day

449
00:18:22,848 --> 00:18:31,069
and and this is what they actually look

450
00:18:25,759 --> 00:18:33,440
like the oilseed is is yellow narrows

451
00:18:31,069 --> 00:18:38,028
center seed code so you can pack more

452
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:40,038
oil in there the rapid cycler imv 211

453
00:18:38,028 --> 00:18:41,898
has dark seeds and you can see this is

454
00:18:40,038 --> 00:18:43,638
bigger but this guy's already flowering

455
00:18:41,898 --> 00:18:45,918
it's a rapid sector so there were little

456
00:18:43,638 --> 00:18:48,558
different recombinant inbred line

457
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:50,509
population generated from these and so

458
00:18:48,558 --> 00:18:53,658
first we want to know is there variation

459
00:18:50,509 --> 00:18:55,700
among accession to Brassica Rapa in

460
00:18:53,659 --> 00:18:58,429
terms of circadian parameters so we just

461
00:18:55,700 --> 00:19:02,149
went to a Dutch sock Center and got

462
00:18:58,429 --> 00:19:03,379
fifty cultivated accessions measured

463
00:19:02,148 --> 00:19:05,148
circadian period length of three

464
00:19:03,378 --> 00:19:07,158
different temperatures and we saw quite

465
00:19:05,148 --> 00:19:08,868
a range of skating period lengths we

466
00:19:07,159 --> 00:19:12,289
then applied that divided and fifty were

467
00:19:08,868 --> 00:19:14,418
dominated grid lines and in every case

468
00:19:12,288 --> 00:19:16,038
we see transgressive variation and a lot

469
00:19:14,419 --> 00:19:18,679
of variation every bit as much variation

470
00:19:16,038 --> 00:19:21,648
among these lines derived from the two

471
00:19:18,679 --> 00:19:24,710
parents that are indicated by the circle

472
00:19:21,648 --> 00:19:28,189
and the square as we saw in this global

473
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:30,409
collection so we can map QTL and so

474
00:19:28,190 --> 00:19:32,269
while we were mapping QTL cynthia was

475
00:19:30,409 --> 00:19:34,340
not first Akkadian period Cynthia was

476
00:19:32,269 --> 00:19:35,749
mapping QTL for all kinds of

477
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:37,759
morphometric parameters and

478
00:19:35,749 --> 00:19:39,319
physiological parameters and the idea

479
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:42,019
was then we bring the two together and

480
00:19:39,319 --> 00:19:43,819
it correlates them and ask is clock

481
00:19:42,019 --> 00:19:47,899
function contributing to some of these

482
00:19:43,819 --> 00:19:49,908
other functions when we did this we

483
00:19:47,898 --> 00:19:53,089
observed the QTL at this position on

484
00:19:49,909 --> 00:19:54,919
chromosome 9 and so at this point the

485
00:19:53,089 --> 00:19:57,319
Brassica genome had just been released

486
00:19:54,919 --> 00:19:59,149
we had a sense of what candidate genes

487
00:19:57,319 --> 00:20:01,308
were there and now I want to introduce

488
00:19:59,148 --> 00:20:03,288
one of the complications

489
00:20:01,308 --> 00:20:04,339
Brassica Rapa is just like a rabid

490
00:20:03,288 --> 00:20:09,919
abscess

491
00:20:04,339 --> 00:20:12,918
on steroids perhaps but since since the

492
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:15,110
separation of Arabidopsis from for

493
00:20:12,919 --> 00:20:19,038
abrasca from Arabidopsis it's undergone

494
00:20:15,109 --> 00:20:20,408
a whole genome replication and so we

495
00:20:19,038 --> 00:20:23,058
mapped out where all the various

496
00:20:20,409 --> 00:20:24,860
candidate genes were based on symphony

497
00:20:23,058 --> 00:20:27,259
with the rabbit axis and we had a

498
00:20:24,859 --> 00:20:29,298
candidate underlying this one vetted

499
00:20:27,259 --> 00:20:31,970
where there was only one copy had been

500
00:20:29,298 --> 00:20:33,319
retained after polyploid ization you get

501
00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:35,480
a lot of fractionation a lot of gene

502
00:20:33,319 --> 00:20:37,490
loss we thought if we pick one whether

503
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:39,409
it's just a single copy life would

504
00:20:37,490 --> 00:20:41,149
potentially be simpler and the gene

505
00:20:39,409 --> 00:20:43,370
underlying that particular queue tail

506
00:20:41,148 --> 00:20:44,689
was a gene called gigantea which is

507
00:20:43,369 --> 00:20:47,658
known in a rabid opposites to be

508
00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:49,038
important for flowering time loss of

509
00:20:47,659 --> 00:20:51,350
function mutation is very late flowering

510
00:20:49,038 --> 00:20:53,509
and also for CKD n' function so we

511
00:20:51,349 --> 00:20:55,069
thought that's a good candidate so the

512
00:20:53,509 --> 00:20:58,009
first thing we did was try and confirm

513
00:20:55,069 --> 00:21:00,168
genetically that there really was a gene

514
00:20:58,009 --> 00:21:01,940
in that region and we were lucky in

515
00:21:00,169 --> 00:21:04,990
doing this nobody had McNeil's or

516
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:07,669
something like this but we got the

517
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:09,470
population of rills very early they were

518
00:21:07,669 --> 00:21:11,179
only been solved about three times and

519
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:13,850
so there was still a lot of residual

520
00:21:11,179 --> 00:21:16,309
hetero zygosity so we could take one of

521
00:21:13,849 --> 00:21:20,019
the reals that was heterozygous over the

522
00:21:16,308 --> 00:21:22,668
QTL and simply sell fit and generate a

523
00:21:20,019 --> 00:21:25,369
two parents in an otherwise somewhat I

524
00:21:22,669 --> 00:21:28,130
guess background with the parental DNA

525
00:21:25,369 --> 00:21:30,019
either from our 500 or imv to 11 in

526
00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:32,539
doing that we we had a recombination

527
00:21:30,019 --> 00:21:34,250
event that that greatly reduced the

528
00:21:32,538 --> 00:21:35,980
interval we could simply compare these

529
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:38,089
two lines and indeed there was a

530
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:41,360
statistically significant difference in

531
00:21:38,089 --> 00:21:44,058
period that was consistent imb to 11 as

532
00:21:41,359 --> 00:21:45,109
a longer period than our 500 so okay

533
00:21:44,058 --> 00:21:48,379
there's something there

534
00:21:45,109 --> 00:21:50,269
if gigantea were to be the genus

535
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:52,460
responsible presumably there'd be some

536
00:21:50,269 --> 00:21:54,440
sort of polymorphism between the two

537
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:57,649
alleles so we resequenced the two

538
00:21:54,440 --> 00:22:00,850
alleles we found a ton of snips three of

539
00:21:57,648 --> 00:22:03,168
which were actually predicted to be

540
00:22:00,849 --> 00:22:06,379
missense mutations changing the amino

541
00:22:03,169 --> 00:22:08,750
acid sequence a Assyrian to alanine and

542
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:10,610
so on and so forth so then we went right

543
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:12,470
to the transgenic endgame I told you we

544
00:22:10,609 --> 00:22:14,509
can't transform braska terribly well so

545
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:16,548
we just went into a rabid opposites put

546
00:22:14,509 --> 00:22:21,138
the breast allele central rabid odds

547
00:22:16,548 --> 00:22:22,759
and and we got very lucky and got a home

548
00:22:21,138 --> 00:22:25,458
run with the first experiment because

549
00:22:22,759 --> 00:22:26,868
when we introduced the IMD allele into a

550
00:22:25,459 --> 00:22:28,669
rabid abscess nothing happened at

551
00:22:26,868 --> 00:22:30,798
circadian period late but when we

552
00:22:28,669 --> 00:22:32,359
introduced the r500 aliyah and that's

553
00:22:30,798 --> 00:22:34,249
the one with shorter period Braska we

554
00:22:32,358 --> 00:22:36,739
had a significant shortening of

555
00:22:34,249 --> 00:22:38,598
circadian period length there were three

556
00:22:36,739 --> 00:22:41,239
mutations so we started making chimeric

557
00:22:38,598 --> 00:22:43,298
genes and ultimately the final thing

558
00:22:41,239 --> 00:22:47,538
which simply made point mutation to

559
00:22:43,298 --> 00:22:50,088
recapitulate this mutation and so the

560
00:22:47,538 --> 00:22:51,679
imb to 11 allele that doesn't shortens

561
00:22:50,088 --> 00:22:53,838
Akkadian period length if we simply make

562
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:57,349
that one nucleotide change to change

563
00:22:53,838 --> 00:22:59,239
that amino acid to the r500 version it

564
00:22:57,348 --> 00:23:01,729
now shortens period and the current furs

565
00:22:59,239 --> 00:23:04,669
are 500 shortens period but if we change

566
00:23:01,729 --> 00:23:06,919
that back to the IMD residue at that

567
00:23:04,669 --> 00:23:08,929
position feels the shortened period so

568
00:23:06,919 --> 00:23:10,549
that's the gene and that's the

569
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:12,619
nucleotide and that's the amino acid

570
00:23:10,548 --> 00:23:15,888
responsible for this by chemically

571
00:23:12,618 --> 00:23:20,358
mechanistically we don't understand but

572
00:23:15,888 --> 00:23:21,828
but that is the mutation it's not like

573
00:23:20,358 --> 00:23:25,398
the two alleles one is active the other

574
00:23:21,828 --> 00:23:27,648
is inactive because both alleles fully

575
00:23:25,398 --> 00:23:29,268
rescue the late flowering phenotype of a

576
00:23:27,648 --> 00:23:32,208
loss-of-function giganteus so they're

577
00:23:29,269 --> 00:23:34,729
active equally active for flowering

578
00:23:32,209 --> 00:23:36,200
timing and and gigantea turned out to be

579
00:23:34,729 --> 00:23:38,088
we didn't know when we started this but

580
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:39,409
it's pretty interesting because it does

581
00:23:38,088 --> 00:23:41,690
a lot of things we know about there was

582
00:23:39,409 --> 00:23:43,909
a hyper continent i p-- difference and

583
00:23:41,690 --> 00:23:45,588
and and everything in that totally puts

584
00:23:43,909 --> 00:23:48,440
Akkadian period applies to the hypo

585
00:23:45,588 --> 00:23:50,708
caudal phenotype also it turns out loss

586
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:56,179
of gigantea function in a rabid abscess

587
00:23:50,709 --> 00:24:00,379
confers tolerance to cold enhances

588
00:23:56,179 --> 00:24:03,379
tolerance to cold and that's seen here

589
00:24:00,378 --> 00:24:08,199
it's able to tolerate lower temperatures

590
00:24:03,378 --> 00:24:10,668
than wild-type and the imb 211 allele

591
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:12,828
eliminates that whereas the r500 allele

592
00:24:10,669 --> 00:24:15,049
does not and the chimera genes behave

593
00:24:12,828 --> 00:24:19,848
consistently and there's a similar

594
00:24:15,048 --> 00:24:23,778
phenotype that I took out apparently

595
00:24:19,848 --> 00:24:26,058
with salt tolerance and and that behaves

596
00:24:23,778 --> 00:24:29,138
the same so we wanted to ask okay that's

597
00:24:26,058 --> 00:24:29,138
all in a rabbit abscess

598
00:24:29,359 --> 00:24:34,089
this mutation matter and do the same

599
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:36,950
things in Brassica Rapa and for that

600
00:24:34,089 --> 00:24:38,539
I've always regard relied on the

601
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:40,580
kindness of friends and large district

602
00:24:38,539 --> 00:24:42,649
art at the John Innes Institute had

603
00:24:40,579 --> 00:24:45,798
developed a spectacular tilling

604
00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:48,470
population in an oilseed roa team that's

605
00:24:45,798 --> 00:24:50,808
closely related are 500 and so we sent

606
00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:54,230
him 2,500 bucks and he sent us 22

607
00:24:50,808 --> 00:24:55,639
alleles of gigantea including four of

608
00:24:54,230 --> 00:25:01,009
which were presumptive loss-of-function

609
00:24:55,640 --> 00:25:05,509
and and so here are two of them and it's

610
00:25:01,009 --> 00:25:07,640
late flowering a loss of gigantea late

611
00:25:05,509 --> 00:25:10,339
flowering enhances freezing tolerance

612
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:12,020
and enhances salt tolerance in Brassica

613
00:25:10,339 --> 00:25:13,428
Rapa so it's behaving quite similar in

614
00:25:12,019 --> 00:25:16,879
to the rabbit opposite story

615
00:25:13,429 --> 00:25:18,919
it also doesn't do much the circadian

616
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:21,290
rhythmicity at 18 degrees but at 22

617
00:25:18,919 --> 00:25:23,870
degrees really flattens out the rhythm

618
00:25:21,289 --> 00:25:30,700
is a big loss of amplitude so it's clock

619
00:25:23,869 --> 00:25:34,189
active as well there so we got a QTL

620
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:41,630
braska as I mentioned is a highly plant

621
00:25:34,190 --> 00:25:43,940
play morphic resonance and there's leafy

622
00:25:41,630 --> 00:25:46,910
vegetables of course we're more familiar

623
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:48,798
in in North America with the ola ratio

624
00:25:46,910 --> 00:25:51,650
equivalents where it's cabbage and

625
00:25:48,798 --> 00:25:54,349
brussel sprouts and cauliflower and

626
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:56,390
broccoli and so on and so forth and and

627
00:25:54,349 --> 00:25:58,939
a lot of this may be because of this

628
00:25:56,390 --> 00:26:02,299
triplet ization providing the material

629
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:04,610
for diversification and and of course we

630
00:26:02,298 --> 00:26:06,889
know the gene duplication underlies the

631
00:26:04,609 --> 00:26:08,808
radiation of the angiosperms below all

632
00:26:06,890 --> 00:26:10,759
the importance of division see right

633
00:26:08,808 --> 00:26:12,740
before the ancestral gene plant that was

634
00:26:10,759 --> 00:26:14,509
all genome duplication before the

635
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:16,579
ancestral angiosperm is all genome

636
00:26:14,509 --> 00:26:18,349
duplication if you're a rabbit UPS

637
00:26:16,579 --> 00:26:20,240
eccentric you're familiar with the gamma

638
00:26:18,349 --> 00:26:22,069
beta and alpha duplications on the road

639
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:24,500
to a rabbit OPS's but this little

640
00:26:22,069 --> 00:26:26,928
triangle up here in Brassica Rapa is

641
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:29,509
this recent whole genome triplication

642
00:26:26,929 --> 00:26:32,360
that's gone on there and and so

643
00:26:29,509 --> 00:26:34,160
typically these events are followed by a

644
00:26:32,359 --> 00:26:36,439
great deal of fractionation a lot of

645
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:39,980
gene laws and so when we wanted to

646
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:42,830
evaluate candidates for our clock qtls

647
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:44,839
we wanted to map all the various

648
00:26:42,829 --> 00:26:47,509
Ravin abscess clock genes on the basis

649
00:26:44,839 --> 00:26:49,668
of synthetic position and and when we

650
00:26:47,509 --> 00:26:54,200
did that we realized we could ask a

651
00:26:49,669 --> 00:26:55,850
question our clock genes fractionated

652
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:59,269
loss at the same rate as everything else

653
00:26:55,849 --> 00:27:01,609
or are they somehow different and and

654
00:26:59,269 --> 00:27:04,849
Jim birch ler and my frailing have

655
00:27:01,609 --> 00:27:06,439
elaborated this dosage hypothesis it

656
00:27:04,849 --> 00:27:08,269
says that that genes that are highly

657
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:11,149
networked or genes that are dosage

658
00:27:08,269 --> 00:27:13,130
dependent cannot be lost

659
00:27:11,148 --> 00:27:15,558
following a whole genome duplication

660
00:27:13,130 --> 00:27:17,899
because you throw off that dosage

661
00:27:15,558 --> 00:27:21,109
balance and of course all the genes in

662
00:27:17,898 --> 00:27:22,908
the clock are are semi dominant and

663
00:27:21,109 --> 00:27:24,349
dosage sensitive and so we thought well

664
00:27:22,909 --> 00:27:27,019
maybe they're preferentially retained

665
00:27:24,349 --> 00:27:28,308
and when we started looking we started

666
00:27:27,019 --> 00:27:31,220
thinking this might be the case here's

667
00:27:28,308 --> 00:27:35,509
one gene family of five suitor response

668
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:37,130
regulators here are 9 7 5 3 and P R 1

669
00:27:35,509 --> 00:27:39,679
which is also more commonly known as

670
00:27:37,130 --> 00:27:41,419
talk 1 and you'll notice for PR 5

671
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:44,179
there's three copies for pair 9 there's

672
00:27:41,419 --> 00:27:45,470
two copies two copies for pair seven

673
00:27:44,179 --> 00:27:48,230
looks like they're preferentially

674
00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:50,808
retained perhaps and so we compared the

675
00:27:48,230 --> 00:27:52,669
clock genes to the 10 synthetic genes

676
00:27:50,808 --> 00:27:54,440
around each of the clock genes and the

677
00:27:52,669 --> 00:27:56,809
clock genes about 60% of them are

678
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:59,179
routine in rapa whereas only about 40%

679
00:27:56,808 --> 00:28:01,759
of the synthetic genes work so yeah they

680
00:27:59,179 --> 00:28:03,259
are preferentially retained and it could

681
00:28:01,759 --> 00:28:06,169
be that this this whole genome

682
00:28:03,259 --> 00:28:08,990
duplication business implants underlies

683
00:28:06,169 --> 00:28:11,630
the proliferation of clock genes and and

684
00:28:08,990 --> 00:28:14,149
it just empirically when you look at the

685
00:28:11,630 --> 00:28:16,070
hairballs to describe the oscillator in

686
00:28:14,148 --> 00:28:19,069
animals versus plants they look a little

687
00:28:16,069 --> 00:28:21,980
more complicated in plants and and and

688
00:28:19,069 --> 00:28:25,638
so if you look from a single-celled alga

689
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:27,230
through Moss to a rabid abscess Nebraska

690
00:28:25,638 --> 00:28:29,388
you can just see a proliferation of

691
00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:32,120
potential clock genes and so we're very

692
00:28:29,388 --> 00:28:33,969
curious whether or not this has a

693
00:28:32,119 --> 00:28:37,428
whether there's now neo

694
00:28:33,970 --> 00:28:40,220
functionalisation and a sub

695
00:28:37,429 --> 00:28:42,500
functionalisation in rapid relative to

696
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:43,880
what we know in a rabid offices I'm not

697
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:46,398
going to talk about that today but those

698
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:47,960
are ongoing projects in the lab so we

699
00:28:46,398 --> 00:28:52,459
wanted to describe the circadian

700
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:54,259
transcriptome in in rapa and so we just

701
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:55,460
set up video a classic experiment you in

702
00:28:54,259 --> 00:28:56,720
training plants so a light dark cycle

703
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:59,019
release them

704
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:01,519
into continuous light in temperature and

705
00:28:59,019 --> 00:29:06,319
we've harvested tissue every two hours

706
00:29:01,519 --> 00:29:11,538
for 48 hours using this oil seed our 500

707
00:29:06,319 --> 00:29:14,689
and starting to look at this and and so

708
00:29:11,538 --> 00:29:17,839
here's a set of clock genes they're

709
00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:20,600
present three of them are present in two

710
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:22,819
copies in rapa third ones present and

711
00:29:20,599 --> 00:29:24,829
three copies so just in this survey and

712
00:29:22,819 --> 00:29:27,319
this is representative what we see and

713
00:29:24,829 --> 00:29:29,599
other people have seen typically when

714
00:29:27,319 --> 00:29:33,529
you start looking at one of these

715
00:29:29,599 --> 00:29:38,149
polyploids you can fractionate the

716
00:29:33,529 --> 00:29:40,788
genomes and and there will be a dominant

717
00:29:38,150 --> 00:29:42,559
genome and a sub dominant genome or

718
00:29:40,788 --> 00:29:44,480
genomes well one of the genomes is

719
00:29:42,558 --> 00:29:47,980
expressed at higher level than the other

720
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:51,620
and we see that here one copy of LH why

721
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:53,509
that mid domain transcription factors

722
00:29:51,619 --> 00:29:55,819
expressed at higher level than the other

723
00:29:53,509 --> 00:29:59,839
same with talked one same with there are

724
00:29:55,819 --> 00:30:01,609
seven the same seer with p RR v where b

725
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:03,500
or v is what we're calling the c copy

726
00:30:01,609 --> 00:30:05,798
here is expressed at higher level but

727
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:08,450
now we start seeing evidence perhaps of

728
00:30:05,798 --> 00:30:10,490
perhaps and sub functionalisation going

729
00:30:08,450 --> 00:30:14,630
on because you'll notice one of these

730
00:30:10,490 --> 00:30:18,940
genes here are 5b is peeking earlier

731
00:30:14,630 --> 00:30:21,950
than the other to see and a and and so

732
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:24,320
we don't know if these are now starting

733
00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:27,048
to subdivide functions up or acquire new

734
00:30:24,319 --> 00:30:29,480
functions but certainly in terms of the

735
00:30:27,048 --> 00:30:31,759
pattern of transcript abundance we're

736
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:35,450
starting to see changes and we see this

737
00:30:31,759 --> 00:30:37,700
in some but not in all of the genes so

738
00:30:35,450 --> 00:30:39,980
if you start trying to sort these out

739
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:43,669
and the various clustering algorithms

740
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:45,679
we're using on network analysis to look

741
00:30:43,669 --> 00:30:47,720
at this one of the predominant things

742
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:50,720
when you sort the transcriptome is time

743
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:52,579
of date and we can sort this out in two

744
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:55,759
clusters on the basis of time of day of

745
00:30:52,579 --> 00:30:58,788
the peak transcript abundance ZT that's

746
00:30:55,759 --> 00:30:59,619
a site Gaber time it's from the german

747
00:30:58,788 --> 00:31:04,099
timegiver

748
00:30:59,619 --> 00:31:06,558
dawn the last light dark electrons

749
00:31:04,099 --> 00:31:08,089
transition is ET zero and then you scale

750
00:31:06,558 --> 00:31:10,369
from them and if you're doing a light

751
00:31:08,089 --> 00:31:12,740
dark cycle you go ZT

752
00:31:10,369 --> 00:31:14,689
zero up to 24 which becomes zero again

753
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:17,180
and so we can bend them out according to

754
00:31:14,690 --> 00:31:18,529
phase and see clusters of genes and all

755
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:22,580
the different times this is just the

756
00:31:18,529 --> 00:31:26,750
first few phases we can start also doing

757
00:31:22,579 --> 00:31:31,970
a network analysis for example in the

758
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:34,970
family of the free purify genes and a5b

759
00:31:31,970 --> 00:31:37,670
that speaking early is now in a network

760
00:31:34,970 --> 00:31:40,759
that's distinct from the two copies of

761
00:31:37,670 --> 00:31:43,759
5c and 5a that are peeking a little

762
00:31:40,759 --> 00:31:46,339
later and these have targets in grey

763
00:31:43,759 --> 00:31:48,410
that are in common as well as own Co

764
00:31:46,339 --> 00:31:51,049
Express not targets but Co expressed

765
00:31:48,410 --> 00:31:53,240
genes and so we're starting to see some

766
00:31:51,049 --> 00:31:55,129
subdivision of the networks among the

767
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:58,490
different copies and we think that may

768
00:31:55,130 --> 00:32:02,240
be offering the opportunity for greater

769
00:31:58,490 --> 00:32:04,009
complexity in in fractioning a genome

770
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:06,890
expression but we don't know yet it's

771
00:32:04,009 --> 00:32:10,640
very early days we wanted to start

772
00:32:06,890 --> 00:32:14,420
looking at response to biotic stresses

773
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:15,890
and and I mentioned up gating the idea

774
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:17,750
that the ability to mount a response

775
00:32:15,890 --> 00:32:19,990
will be a function at the time of day at

776
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:22,609
which that the stress is encountered and

777
00:32:19,990 --> 00:32:25,880
and so that sort of Illustrated here if

778
00:32:22,609 --> 00:32:28,639
we provide a stress say at this point we

779
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:31,100
might get one response we apprised on we

780
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:32,480
might get one response if we provided a

781
00:32:31,099 --> 00:32:36,709
dusk we might get a different response

782
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:38,360
on a basic transcript cycle um generally

783
00:32:36,710 --> 00:32:40,910
what people encounter when they do this

784
00:32:38,359 --> 00:32:44,359
is they see if there's a basal rhythm in

785
00:32:40,910 --> 00:32:48,050
the transcript it tends it to be that

786
00:32:44,359 --> 00:32:49,939
the peak in response to a perturbation

787
00:32:48,049 --> 00:32:52,369
tends to be at the time of peak

788
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:56,029
expression this was first observed by

789
00:32:52,369 --> 00:32:58,009
Andrew Miller working with Steve K she

790
00:32:56,029 --> 00:33:00,889
quite a while ago now just looking at

791
00:32:58,009 --> 00:33:04,759
the light induce ability of cab genes

792
00:33:00,890 --> 00:33:06,860
and and they peak in about the middle of

793
00:33:04,759 --> 00:33:08,269
the morning and that turns out to be if

794
00:33:06,859 --> 00:33:12,339
you put them in the dark and given

795
00:33:08,269 --> 00:33:14,839
pulses of light you trace their basal

796
00:33:12,339 --> 00:33:16,549
waveform on their induce ability or

797
00:33:14,839 --> 00:33:18,589
their induce ability simply mimics that

798
00:33:16,549 --> 00:33:21,379
when they're maximally expressed that's

799
00:33:18,589 --> 00:33:23,809
when you get maximum induction and so

800
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:24,380
we're anticipating seeing something like

801
00:33:23,809 --> 00:33:26,839
this

802
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:28,820
and so we wanted to and and this has

803
00:33:26,839 --> 00:33:31,428
been seen by Mike Thomas shows lab for

804
00:33:28,819 --> 00:33:34,129
example in cold induction of the CBS

805
00:33:31,429 --> 00:33:35,509
where if you provide a cold pulse for

806
00:33:34,130 --> 00:33:37,850
hours after done you get strong

807
00:33:35,509 --> 00:33:39,950
induction if you ride the same cold post

808
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:41,959
16 hours after done you get very minimal

809
00:33:39,950 --> 00:33:44,090
induction and so there's the circadian

810
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:47,720
gating of the induction of the cold

811
00:33:44,089 --> 00:33:51,319
regular so we wanted to look at drought

812
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:53,179
why well corn yields if you look you

813
00:33:51,319 --> 00:33:56,058
know whenever there's a dip often that's

814
00:33:53,179 --> 00:33:59,230
associated with draw a dry year and so

815
00:33:56,058 --> 00:34:02,058
we thought we could look at this also uh

816
00:33:59,230 --> 00:34:06,169
Olivia Wilkins had suggested that there

817
00:34:02,058 --> 00:34:08,719
was a circadian gating of drought

818
00:34:06,169 --> 00:34:10,340
responses in both rabbit abscess and

819
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:13,000
poplar so we thought this would be a

820
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:16,250
good place to look in Brassica Rapa and

821
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:19,280
and we know that there's likely to be a

822
00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:21,409
clock intersection from some Arab adopts

823
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:23,750
this work we know that if you perturb

824
00:34:21,409 --> 00:34:26,898
the expression of talk one either over

825
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:29,809
express it or do a knockdown or a loss

826
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:33,049
of function mutation on you see effects

827
00:34:29,809 --> 00:34:36,739
on stomatal aperture in response to ABA

828
00:34:33,050 --> 00:34:40,010
the closing is is attenuated by talk one

829
00:34:36,739 --> 00:34:41,689
over expression we know that a triple

830
00:34:40,010 --> 00:34:44,950
loss of function mutation of three of

831
00:34:41,690 --> 00:34:48,079
the PRRS here are nine seven and five

832
00:34:44,949 --> 00:34:50,239
enhances drug tolerance in a rabid

833
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:51,829
once's and so we thought that you know

834
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:53,418
there's good evidence suggesting this in

835
00:34:51,829 --> 00:34:55,759
the o'clock intersection with the

836
00:34:53,418 --> 00:34:59,809
drought response and so we went after

837
00:34:55,760 --> 00:35:02,869
this our collaborators particularly of

838
00:34:59,809 --> 00:35:05,179
brent yours and lena lasagna at the

839
00:35:02,869 --> 00:35:08,119
university of wyoming spent a lot of

840
00:35:05,179 --> 00:35:10,000
time trying to get conditions where they

841
00:35:08,119 --> 00:35:13,970
could withhold water and and get a

842
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:16,099
gradual loss of soil water moisture and

843
00:35:13,969 --> 00:35:18,230
look in the earliest stages of the

844
00:35:16,099 --> 00:35:19,730
drought response and that that's what

845
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:22,219
we're trying to do here here's a soil

846
00:35:19,730 --> 00:35:25,190
moisture in well watered verses our

847
00:35:22,219 --> 00:35:28,129
dreaded plants over we would held water

848
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:29,990
a day before this so we're looking in

849
00:35:28,130 --> 00:35:33,470
the second and third days of drought

850
00:35:29,989 --> 00:35:35,838
here and and we're seeing only small

851
00:35:33,469 --> 00:35:37,730
changes in the mental conductance in the

852
00:35:35,838 --> 00:35:37,969
well-watered versus the drier climate so

853
00:35:37,730 --> 00:35:39,740
it

854
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:42,079
very early response these are a long way

855
00:35:39,739 --> 00:35:46,729
from from wilting and so we're going to

856
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:48,199
look these guys that Wyoming guys are

857
00:35:46,730 --> 00:35:50,150
going to look at a lot of physiological

858
00:35:48,199 --> 00:35:53,269
parameters and we're going to look at

859
00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:56,030
the transcriptomic response and the 50

860
00:35:53,269 --> 00:35:59,539
of it so they measured a photosynthetic

861
00:35:56,030 --> 00:36:01,580
rate semental conductance photosystem 2

862
00:35:59,539 --> 00:36:05,389
efficiency non-structural carbohydrates

863
00:36:01,579 --> 00:36:08,389
and and there are not much for

864
00:36:05,389 --> 00:36:10,460
photosynthetic rate but we see a tomato

865
00:36:08,389 --> 00:36:13,489
conductance changes with it depleted and

866
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:15,608
the dreaded plants late in the day sort

867
00:36:13,489 --> 00:36:17,598
of what you might expect we see perhaps

868
00:36:15,608 --> 00:36:19,400
compensations in photosystem 2

869
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:22,190
efficiency which seems to be slightly

870
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:26,349
greater in the dreaded plants that Wow

871
00:36:22,190 --> 00:36:29,030
maybe why a photosynthetic carbon

872
00:36:26,349 --> 00:36:31,099
assimilation doesn't fall off and we see

873
00:36:29,030 --> 00:36:32,750
some changes that they're significant

874
00:36:31,099 --> 00:36:34,760
but I'm not sure I understand them at

875
00:36:32,750 --> 00:36:37,250
all in non structural carbohydrates but

876
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:40,010
there are subtle physiological changes

877
00:36:37,250 --> 00:36:42,500
in the plant when we look at the

878
00:36:40,010 --> 00:36:44,900
transcriptome one of the things we see

879
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:49,460
that's predicted from what Olivia

880
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:51,650
Wilkins had done is that if you do a

881
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:54,230
cladogram the drought and well-watered

882
00:36:51,650 --> 00:36:58,639
plants cluster together according to

883
00:36:54,230 --> 00:37:00,349
time of day so there's a massive Reese

884
00:36:58,639 --> 00:37:02,210
culling of the transcriptome in response

885
00:37:00,349 --> 00:37:03,230
to the clock there's big time of day

886
00:37:02,210 --> 00:37:07,280
changes about a third of the

887
00:37:03,230 --> 00:37:10,099
transcriptome cycles depending on where

888
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:13,010
and how you look and so what we what we

889
00:37:10,099 --> 00:37:16,430
actually see then is is the time of day

890
00:37:13,010 --> 00:37:21,650
signal is predominant over any response

891
00:37:16,429 --> 00:37:23,949
to this slight drought condition and so

892
00:37:21,650 --> 00:37:28,760
what we're looking at for subtle changes

893
00:37:23,949 --> 00:37:32,269
we're doing a way to gene correlation

894
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:34,160
analysis team correlation expression and

895
00:37:32,269 --> 00:37:35,269
out network analysis yeah and so we're

896
00:37:34,159 --> 00:37:38,569
going to split this up we're going to

897
00:37:35,269 --> 00:37:40,219
make grouted Network drought 'add and a

898
00:37:38,570 --> 00:37:42,289
well water Network we're going to

899
00:37:40,219 --> 00:37:44,989
establish consensus by comparing the two

900
00:37:42,289 --> 00:37:46,969
and then we're going to look for a

901
00:37:44,989 --> 00:37:49,819
modules groups of core express genes

902
00:37:46,969 --> 00:37:51,469
that respond and are correlated with the

903
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:53,690
physiological data

904
00:37:51,469 --> 00:37:55,069
and unique to the dreaded Network that's

905
00:37:53,690 --> 00:37:58,220
what we're trying to do and it's very

906
00:37:55,070 --> 00:37:59,869
early days in this analysis but we can

907
00:37:58,219 --> 00:38:02,959
we can set up and the different modules

908
00:37:59,869 --> 00:38:04,789
are colored color-coordinated and we can

909
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:07,220
do that with well watered and drought it

910
00:38:04,789 --> 00:38:09,289
and we can split them up into modules

911
00:38:07,219 --> 00:38:17,419
the top eight modules from each network

912
00:38:09,289 --> 00:38:19,519
contain about 80 85 percent of the 80 to

913
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:22,550
85 percent of the expressed genes in

914
00:38:19,519 --> 00:38:25,940
these top modules are cycling that's the

915
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:29,210
way to phrase it and so if we can take a

916
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:31,070
well-watered network and and that that

917
00:38:29,210 --> 00:38:32,480
shows here at the eigen gene expression

918
00:38:31,070 --> 00:38:35,119
it's peeking in the middle of the day

919
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:37,550
and then if we re-examine those genes

920
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:40,519
actually they now subdivided into three

921
00:38:37,550 --> 00:38:43,210
sub networks one that looks much like

922
00:38:40,519 --> 00:38:45,619
the parental network unperturbed but to

923
00:38:43,210 --> 00:38:47,570
this network in this network you can see

924
00:38:45,619 --> 00:38:49,849
a broadening of the peak in the daytime

925
00:38:47,570 --> 00:38:54,050
and here's sort of a broadening and a

926
00:38:49,849 --> 00:38:56,539
phase advance trout of the trough and so

927
00:38:54,050 --> 00:38:58,760
these are subtle responses and how and

928
00:38:56,539 --> 00:39:01,550
of course we don't at this point know

929
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:04,910
that they're functionally important but

930
00:39:01,550 --> 00:39:08,510
we can start seeing perturbations of in

931
00:39:04,909 --> 00:39:11,139
response to drought so if we look at

932
00:39:08,510 --> 00:39:15,560
these physiological traits we can

933
00:39:11,139 --> 00:39:18,519
correlate them with the expression

934
00:39:15,559 --> 00:39:20,750
profiles and we can observe for example

935
00:39:18,519 --> 00:39:24,050
here's a group that's positively

936
00:39:20,750 --> 00:39:28,579
correlated with the physiology with a

937
00:39:24,050 --> 00:39:30,830
first carbon assimilation here's an

938
00:39:28,579 --> 00:39:33,858
example of a group a module that's

939
00:39:30,829 --> 00:39:36,319
negatively correlated with Fe over FM in

940
00:39:33,858 --> 00:39:38,750
doing in creating this curve we we

941
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:40,400
flipped to an absolute take an absolute

942
00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:42,139
value and that's why it looks like a

943
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:44,088
positive correlation it is a negative

944
00:39:42,139 --> 00:39:45,889
correlation and then there's of course

945
00:39:44,088 --> 00:39:47,929
other modules that simply are not

946
00:39:45,889 --> 00:39:51,139
correlated with semental conductance in

947
00:39:47,929 --> 00:39:53,329
this regard what we're starting to see

948
00:39:51,139 --> 00:39:56,299
are things where you know they're

949
00:39:53,329 --> 00:39:58,130
peaking in the throat and not or the

950
00:39:56,300 --> 00:40:00,500
amplitude of the peak is up in drought

951
00:39:58,130 --> 00:40:02,030
versus well water conditions and you

952
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:03,679
know inspection by eye when you look at

953
00:40:02,030 --> 00:40:04,690
this okay here's the pattern that I told

954
00:40:03,679 --> 00:40:07,210
you in the

955
00:40:04,690 --> 00:40:09,460
a water network in the well water this

956
00:40:07,210 --> 00:40:14,108
transcript is peaking and the amplitude

957
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:16,809
is increased under dreaded conditions

958
00:40:14,108 --> 00:40:18,578
but of course inspection by I is pretty

959
00:40:16,809 --> 00:40:22,509
unsatisfying so we've tried a number of

960
00:40:18,579 --> 00:40:24,240
things we've taken a pro trying to

961
00:40:22,510 --> 00:40:27,790
identify rhythmic genes is one of the

962
00:40:24,239 --> 00:40:31,179
challenges in in transcriptomic level

963
00:40:27,789 --> 00:40:33,130
analysis and some people John Hogan and

964
00:40:31,179 --> 00:40:36,940
his colleagues at Penn have developed

965
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:39,130
something called JDK cycle that is a way

966
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:41,530
of evaluating the significance of

967
00:40:39,130 --> 00:40:44,170
rhythmicity and phase and so we're

968
00:40:41,530 --> 00:40:45,460
comparing individual transcripts in the

969
00:40:44,170 --> 00:40:47,050
drought in in well water and we're

970
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:49,119
looking for transcripts that either are

971
00:40:47,050 --> 00:40:53,829
not rhythmic and routed and acquire

972
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:56,050
ethnicity in well water are not rhythmic

973
00:40:53,829 --> 00:40:59,349
in well water and acquire ethnicity and

974
00:40:56,050 --> 00:41:00,970
routed or the converse or ones where

975
00:40:59,349 --> 00:41:03,579
there's an amplitude change either up or

976
00:41:00,969 --> 00:41:05,139
down and and this program is working

977
00:41:03,579 --> 00:41:07,300
fairly well for pulling those out so

978
00:41:05,139 --> 00:41:09,670
we're getting genes in that regard and

979
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:12,099
we can build networks among these genes

980
00:41:09,670 --> 00:41:13,690
here's for example a network of drug

981
00:41:12,099 --> 00:41:15,490
responsive genes that are positively

982
00:41:13,690 --> 00:41:17,858
correlated with the metal conductors and

983
00:41:15,489 --> 00:41:22,449
and it's actually three overlapping

984
00:41:17,858 --> 00:41:23,889
networks and there are conversely drug

985
00:41:22,449 --> 00:41:25,568
responsive genes that are negatively

986
00:41:23,889 --> 00:41:26,980
correlated instrumental conductance so

987
00:41:25,568 --> 00:41:30,730
we're trying to parse out the

988
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:32,980
transcriptome in this sense but our

989
00:41:30,730 --> 00:41:34,449
analysis is far from complete and then

990
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:36,969
of course the hard thing is going to be

991
00:41:34,449 --> 00:41:43,568
to relate specific changes with

992
00:41:36,969 --> 00:41:51,459
differential drug response now when does

993
00:41:43,568 --> 00:41:53,769
this end okay okay so we wanted to scale

994
00:41:51,460 --> 00:41:57,250
up and I gave you my my Hani spiel about

995
00:41:53,769 --> 00:41:59,068
how we could scale up and so we wanted

996
00:41:57,250 --> 00:42:01,150
to look at a lot of different plants

997
00:41:59,068 --> 00:42:04,779
across the eudicots

998
00:42:01,150 --> 00:42:07,480
and so when we did that we could observe

999
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:10,410
in a rabid abscess and other braska but

1000
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:13,568
we went into things like NIMH ulis and

1001
00:42:10,409 --> 00:42:16,299
as far as soybean and and it turns out

1002
00:42:13,568 --> 00:42:18,068
that this new program that Hani wrote

1003
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:19,170
for us that we call trip tracking

1004
00:42:18,068 --> 00:42:22,029
rhythms and

1005
00:42:19,170 --> 00:42:24,970
seems to be generally applicable across

1006
00:42:22,030 --> 00:42:27,670
the US and that allowed us to to

1007
00:42:24,969 --> 00:42:29,079
investigate one of the things that I've

1008
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:31,720
been really interested in and started

1009
00:42:29,079 --> 00:42:35,199
out talking with is there some sort of

1010
00:42:31,719 --> 00:42:39,368
can we evaluate a fitness effect of

1011
00:42:35,199 --> 00:42:41,949
clock performance and so we started out

1012
00:42:39,369 --> 00:42:44,320
looking in soybeans and and you know

1013
00:42:41,949 --> 00:42:46,299
soybeans it's a different type of rhythm

1014
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:49,390
but beliefs go up and down quite nicely

1015
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:52,960
and and of course you can get the motion

1016
00:42:49,389 --> 00:42:55,150
vectors on it and so we can do this so

1017
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:58,570
what we did was we we went to Monsanto

1018
00:42:55,150 --> 00:43:01,900
and got 50 elite cultivars and and these

1019
00:42:58,570 --> 00:43:04,600
cultivars have been extensively bred for

1020
00:43:01,900 --> 00:43:06,849
basically flowering time and yield

1021
00:43:04,599 --> 00:43:08,319
performance in latitudinal zones they

1022
00:43:06,849 --> 00:43:09,279
call them maturity zones but basically

1023
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:12,190
they're they're grown in these

1024
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:14,019
latitudinal zones and when we looked at

1025
00:43:12,190 --> 00:43:15,670
circadian period in these 50 elite

1026
00:43:14,019 --> 00:43:17,858
cultivars that nobody's messed with her

1027
00:43:15,670 --> 00:43:19,358
clock nobody measured the clock but we

1028
00:43:17,858 --> 00:43:22,179
observed a significant positive

1029
00:43:19,358 --> 00:43:23,440
correlation of period with latitude as

1030
00:43:22,179 --> 00:43:27,909
you move farther north the period

1031
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:29,710
lengthens so were the Monsanto breeders

1032
00:43:27,909 --> 00:43:32,799
inadvertently selecting for circadian

1033
00:43:29,710 --> 00:43:35,829
period Lynx perhaps certainly all they

1034
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:37,840
were looking for was performance of in

1035
00:43:35,829 --> 00:43:43,539
these latitudinal zones so we see this

1036
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:45,700
correlation ah it was a great conceit to

1037
00:43:43,539 --> 00:43:47,320
get it from Monsanto because of course

1038
00:43:45,699 --> 00:43:50,139
no one's going to doubt that they're

1039
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:50,710
well bred the problem is it's the end of

1040
00:43:50,139 --> 00:43:52,299
the road

1041
00:43:50,710 --> 00:43:53,500
they might know what the genes are but

1042
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:57,010
we're not going to know what the genes

1043
00:43:53,500 --> 00:44:00,369
are the agreement didn't include access

1044
00:43:57,010 --> 00:44:02,440
to that so but we've repeated this now

1045
00:44:00,369 --> 00:44:05,619
in in a wild population of monkeys our

1046
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:09,159
emulous and a John Willis and Josh Suzy

1047
00:44:05,619 --> 00:44:10,720
are collected accessions of NIMH ulis

1048
00:44:09,159 --> 00:44:12,849
that grows all the way from the Mexican

1049
00:44:10,719 --> 00:44:15,250
border up well into Canada the Queen

1050
00:44:12,849 --> 00:44:23,469
Charlotte Islands so a huge latitudinal

1051
00:44:15,250 --> 00:44:25,539
range and it is a - we call it natural

1052
00:44:23,469 --> 00:44:28,539
history lifestyle habits annual and

1053
00:44:25,539 --> 00:44:30,809
perennial among the annuals there's an

1054
00:44:28,539 --> 00:44:32,630
even stronger positive correlation of

1055
00:44:30,809 --> 00:44:36,019
latitude and Sukie

1056
00:44:32,630 --> 00:44:37,789
in period so we're we're hoping to go is

1057
00:44:36,019 --> 00:44:39,829
to take these genotypes and start doing

1058
00:44:37,789 --> 00:44:45,800
the common garden experiments and ask

1059
00:44:39,829 --> 00:44:48,079
does circadian performance contribute to

1060
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:50,210
Fitness in the different latitudes so

1061
00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:52,369
that's where we want to go with this we

1062
00:44:50,210 --> 00:44:54,650
haven't done that yet and we've expanded

1063
00:44:52,369 --> 00:44:56,569
dramatically a high fruit sort of

1064
00:44:54,650 --> 00:44:59,150
allowed us to now look at large numbers

1065
00:44:56,570 --> 00:45:01,340
of populations of a rabid axis and this

1066
00:44:59,150 --> 00:45:02,329
is our set all we're using now it's

1067
00:45:01,340 --> 00:45:04,370
where are we

1068
00:45:02,329 --> 00:45:05,480
that's a canon powershot it only till

1069
00:45:04,369 --> 00:45:08,420
there year old you go to Home Depot

1070
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:09,829
they're cheap you can get them you hack

1071
00:45:08,420 --> 00:45:12,380
in and overwrite the software and

1072
00:45:09,829 --> 00:45:14,900
tournaments time-lapse machines and and

1073
00:45:12,380 --> 00:45:17,450
what Hani's program allows us to do is

1074
00:45:14,900 --> 00:45:20,539
capture 120 seedlings and then

1075
00:45:17,449 --> 00:45:23,599
immediately converted into individual

1076
00:45:20,539 --> 00:45:27,110
seedling image temporal image stacks and

1077
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:29,449
then do the entire analysis and release

1078
00:45:27,110 --> 00:45:31,510
period and faith data for that seedling

1079
00:45:29,449 --> 00:45:33,889
and that's seedling in that seedling

1080
00:45:31,510 --> 00:45:35,800
with one click of the button so the

1081
00:45:33,889 --> 00:45:39,589
analytic pipeline is really smooth and

1082
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:42,890
so we can we can fit 14 cameras into our

1083
00:45:39,590 --> 00:45:45,730
our growth room and and so here's an

1084
00:45:42,889 --> 00:45:49,819
example of looking at seven populations

1085
00:45:45,730 --> 00:45:51,139
of all against a common female parent

1086
00:45:49,820 --> 00:45:53,360
called zero

1087
00:45:51,139 --> 00:45:55,339
this figure is four-and-a-half million

1088
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:57,860
images and it was about 30 times faster

1089
00:45:55,340 --> 00:46:01,340
than preceding one so it Hannie is a

1090
00:45:57,860 --> 00:46:04,820
genius as far as I'm concerned and and

1091
00:46:01,340 --> 00:46:06,950
so you get what has been shown if you

1092
00:46:04,820 --> 00:46:10,160
analyze the individual populations you

1093
00:46:06,949 --> 00:46:12,799
get some QTL for skating period a fairly

1094
00:46:10,159 --> 00:46:15,649
low LOD scores if you do the combined

1095
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:16,910
analysis the LOD scores go way up in

1096
00:46:15,650 --> 00:46:19,579
significance gives you increased

1097
00:46:16,909 --> 00:46:21,259
statistical power and so now we're very

1098
00:46:19,579 --> 00:46:24,679
interested in trying to identify some of

1099
00:46:21,260 --> 00:46:26,870
these this one we think might be our old

1100
00:46:24,679 --> 00:46:29,419
friends I gets here this one well the

1101
00:46:26,869 --> 00:46:30,920
candidate there is pr7 this one in the

1102
00:46:29,420 --> 00:46:33,139
middle of four is as far as we know

1103
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:35,329
novel and so we're pretty excited if we

1104
00:46:33,139 --> 00:46:36,920
could actually get a new clock team from

1105
00:46:35,329 --> 00:46:41,719
this quantitative approach that'd be

1106
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:43,700
terrific to do this with a thousand and

1107
00:46:41,719 --> 00:46:45,139
fifty genotypes with all the replication

1108
00:46:43,699 --> 00:46:46,219
you know we had to do randomized block

1109
00:46:45,139 --> 00:46:48,889
design

1110
00:46:46,219 --> 00:46:50,449
and and the postdocs kadian paying came

1111
00:46:48,889 --> 00:46:52,429
to me and said you know we can't stand

1112
00:46:50,449 --> 00:46:53,989
the idea of throwing away the seedlings

1113
00:46:52,429 --> 00:46:56,029
after we've measured leaflessness

1114
00:46:53,989 --> 00:46:57,289
what else can we look at we thought

1115
00:46:56,030 --> 00:46:59,510
about this and we thought well let's go

1116
00:46:57,289 --> 00:47:01,730
back to their example of starch so we

1117
00:46:59,510 --> 00:47:04,130
then took all these plants rid them a

1118
00:47:01,730 --> 00:47:06,260
little longer in a light dark cycle and

1119
00:47:04,130 --> 00:47:08,210
then harvested them and sent them off

1120
00:47:06,260 --> 00:47:10,670
the market in Germany for starch

1121
00:47:08,210 --> 00:47:12,409
analysis and metabolite analysis so now

1122
00:47:10,670 --> 00:47:15,440
on the same population we can measure

1123
00:47:12,409 --> 00:47:18,368
circadian QTL and QTL for residual

1124
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:20,869
starch prior to dawn and when we do that

1125
00:47:18,369 --> 00:47:21,769
they really drag their feet doing it

1126
00:47:20,869 --> 00:47:23,840
because they didn't think anything

1127
00:47:21,769 --> 00:47:25,789
exciting was going to come out and they

1128
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:27,380
discovered more variation in residual

1129
00:47:25,789 --> 00:47:29,420
starts and it was like an order of

1130
00:47:27,380 --> 00:47:30,800
magnitude more than they'd ever seen and

1131
00:47:29,420 --> 00:47:35,090
they were pretty excited so now we have

1132
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:37,250
QTL for a circadian period and starch

1133
00:47:35,090 --> 00:47:39,740
and sometimes it's one or the other and

1134
00:47:37,250 --> 00:47:42,619
sometimes it's both so we're really

1135
00:47:39,739 --> 00:47:44,979
hoping Marc and Alison Smith and I have

1136
00:47:42,619 --> 00:47:47,059
just submitted a proposal to pursue this

1137
00:47:44,980 --> 00:47:49,789
identify some of the genes and really

1138
00:47:47,059 --> 00:47:53,750
look at this interplay of the clock with

1139
00:47:49,789 --> 00:47:56,539
starch metabolism and and it was amazing

1140
00:47:53,750 --> 00:47:59,929
in six of the populations you'd predict

1141
00:47:56,539 --> 00:48:02,539
if you had a long circadian period you'd

1142
00:47:59,929 --> 00:48:04,159
anticipate dawn farther out so you'd be

1143
00:48:02,539 --> 00:48:06,889
burning your starch at a slower rate and

1144
00:48:04,159 --> 00:48:08,989
you'd have more residual starch and in

1145
00:48:06,889 --> 00:48:10,909
every population when you there's a

1146
00:48:08,989 --> 00:48:14,088
positive correlation between period and

1147
00:48:10,909 --> 00:48:16,460
residual starch and in three of the

1148
00:48:14,088 --> 00:48:18,019
populations it's fairly significant so

1149
00:48:16,460 --> 00:48:19,608
it looks like that's borne out across

1150
00:48:18,019 --> 00:48:21,619
season so we're pretty excited at

1151
00:48:19,608 --> 00:48:22,819
pursuing this so that's that's where

1152
00:48:21,619 --> 00:48:24,108
we're going to be going I never would

1153
00:48:22,820 --> 00:48:27,580
have thought I would be interested in

1154
00:48:24,108 --> 00:48:32,509
starch but Marc and Alison of Maeda

1155
00:48:27,579 --> 00:48:33,799
have converted me back in Brassica Rik a

1156
00:48:32,510 --> 00:48:36,290
matheno and Scot would have been

1157
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:37,970
preparing a series of populations in

1158
00:48:36,289 --> 00:48:40,909
this messes association mapping strategy

1159
00:48:37,969 --> 00:48:45,439
so we're hoping to repeat this type of

1160
00:48:40,909 --> 00:48:47,690
work in Brassica Rapa ah of course I

1161
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:50,000
didn't do any of this myself it's a

1162
00:48:47,690 --> 00:48:52,909
product of mostly some great postdocs

1163
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:55,760
Katie Victor ping a former postdoc Chi

1164
00:48:52,909 --> 00:48:58,069
Guang I mentioned Hani a couple of

1165
00:48:55,760 --> 00:49:00,260
visiting scientists darling and Jenna

1166
00:48:58,070 --> 00:49:01,760
from China and Korea

1167
00:49:00,260 --> 00:49:04,369
and a horde of really good

1168
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:06,800
undergraduates current honours thesis

1169
00:49:04,369 --> 00:49:08,420
student and a whole bunch of

1170
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:10,970
collaborator so plant genome work has

1171
00:49:08,420 --> 00:49:13,700
been with Rick and Scott and Cynthia and

1172
00:49:10,969 --> 00:49:16,789
Brin and Lena and Todd and Malia and

1173
00:49:13,699 --> 00:49:20,179
then some collaborators some

1174
00:49:16,789 --> 00:49:24,320
collaborators in South Korea and let's

1175
00:49:20,179 --> 00:49:27,019
see Ganesh and Cindy gave us the soybean

1176
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:29,240
cultivars John and Josh all the numerous

1177
00:49:27,019 --> 00:49:30,980
cultivars and and mark this is an

1178
00:49:29,239 --> 00:49:33,439
optimistic collaboration we're just

1179
00:49:30,980 --> 00:49:35,088
getting started and hopefully it'll lead

1180
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:36,108
to exciting things and of course I want

1181
00:49:35,088 --> 00:49:38,838
to thank the National Science Foundation

1182
00:49:36,108 --> 00:49:40,848
and the Rural Development the agency I

1183
00:49:38,838 --> 00:49:42,739
in South Korea for supporting this work

1184
00:49:40,849 --> 00:49:44,740
and thank you for your attention oh we

1185
00:49:42,739 --> 00:49:51,399
glad to try to answer any questions

1186
00:49:44,739 --> 00:49:51,399
[Applause]

1187
00:49:53,380 --> 00:50:01,820
620 rhythms great yeah that's a little

1188
00:49:58,338 --> 00:50:05,568
controversial a Hyun mo did an

1189
00:50:01,820 --> 00:50:07,849
experiment that suggested mutations in

1190
00:50:05,568 --> 00:50:10,099
cca1 and taequan didn't affect the route

1191
00:50:07,849 --> 00:50:13,099
clock people have revisited that and

1192
00:50:10,099 --> 00:50:16,579
there is a route clock and it looks like

1193
00:50:13,099 --> 00:50:18,920
there is a lot of a guy named endo I

1194
00:50:16,579 --> 00:50:20,810
forget his first name Japanese fellow

1195
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:22,670
starting it was a postdoc with CK's got

1196
00:50:20,809 --> 00:50:25,279
his own lab in Japan has been looking

1197
00:50:22,670 --> 00:50:28,909
systematically and there are different

1198
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:31,130
of the clocks in different tissues are

1199
00:50:28,909 --> 00:50:32,779
functioning slightly differently so

1200
00:50:31,130 --> 00:50:34,640
there's an epidermal clock and a means

1201
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:37,490
of o'clock and a vascular clock and a

1202
00:50:34,639 --> 00:50:39,019
root clock and then Paloma mas dinner in

1203
00:50:37,489 --> 00:50:41,509
in Barcelona did a really interesting

1204
00:50:39,019 --> 00:50:43,730
experiment where she excised the shoot

1205
00:50:41,510 --> 00:50:46,460
apical meristem and discovered that the

1206
00:50:43,730 --> 00:50:48,429
root clock stopped running and so it

1207
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:50,510
looks like there may be some

1208
00:50:48,429 --> 00:50:53,440
hierarchical relationships among these

1209
00:50:50,510 --> 00:50:56,900
so that's a very active area but yeah

1210
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:58,490
there is a root clock we knew that I bet

1211
00:50:56,900 --> 00:51:00,139
I didn't show you these data but I've

1212
00:50:58,489 --> 00:51:02,419
been collaborating with my wife Mary Lou

1213
00:51:00,139 --> 00:51:05,239
Guerin Oh who's Elena's buddy and she

1214
00:51:02,420 --> 00:51:08,659
studies iron homeostasis and it turns

1215
00:51:05,239 --> 00:51:10,639
out I would always be a pain in the butt

1216
00:51:08,659 --> 00:51:12,019
at every one of our student seminars and

1217
00:51:10,639 --> 00:51:12,779
say what time of day to do the

1218
00:51:12,019 --> 00:51:15,449
experiment

1219
00:51:12,780 --> 00:51:18,180
they would say shut up Rob and so I

1220
00:51:15,449 --> 00:51:19,769
would finally my Korean postdoc got

1221
00:51:18,179 --> 00:51:24,149
together with her Korean postdoc and

1222
00:51:19,769 --> 00:51:27,179
finally did the experiment and uh the

1223
00:51:24,150 --> 00:51:28,920
reductase that reduces the iron and the

1224
00:51:27,179 --> 00:51:31,440
transport of the transports the iron in

1225
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:33,930
both show up sir

1226
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:35,909
strongly iron inducible so you only see

1227
00:51:33,929 --> 00:51:38,849
this you're doing under iron starvation

1228
00:51:35,909 --> 00:51:41,369
conditions but their circadian gated so

1229
00:51:38,849 --> 00:51:43,369
they peak dramatically at one particular

1230
00:51:41,369 --> 00:51:45,920
time of day so yes the clock is

1231
00:51:43,369 --> 00:51:48,329
regulating iron homeostasis in the root

1232
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:51,210
so there clearly has to be a root clock

1233
00:51:48,329 --> 00:51:53,369
and and so we're collaborating on trying

1234
00:51:51,210 --> 00:51:56,010
to figure out how that works but we're

1235
00:51:53,369 --> 00:51:59,250
still pretty much in the dark just just

1236
00:51:56,010 --> 00:52:00,900
an issue at the same experiment at in

1237
00:51:59,250 --> 00:52:02,309
hopes given trying to unless you may

1238
00:52:00,900 --> 00:52:04,320
stretch in this post-apocalyptic ation

1239
00:52:02,309 --> 00:52:06,869
and we found like the date about all of

1240
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:08,430
the ways and then you fix the time over

1241
00:52:06,869 --> 00:52:12,989
in a collection and all of its

1242
00:52:08,429 --> 00:52:14,730
variations on so it's a step turns out

1243
00:52:12,989 --> 00:52:16,709
this experiment has been done over and

1244
00:52:14,730 --> 00:52:19,409
over many many many of my collaborators

1245
00:52:16,710 --> 00:52:21,900
and colleagues in the circadian field

1246
00:52:19,409 --> 00:52:23,730
started out doing gene expression and

1247
00:52:21,900 --> 00:52:25,710
one postdoc couldn't reproduce the

1248
00:52:23,730 --> 00:52:27,990
graduate students and one was a lark and

1249
00:52:25,710 --> 00:52:29,639
one with an owl and they fought like

1250
00:52:27,989 --> 00:52:32,579
cats and dogs and then suddenly they

1251
00:52:29,639 --> 00:52:34,619
realize they're both right and so that

1252
00:52:32,579 --> 00:52:36,210
drag has dragged a lot of people into

1253
00:52:34,619 --> 00:52:38,880
the clock fields and kicking and

1254
00:52:36,210 --> 00:52:42,000
screaming typically yeah I think it's a

1255
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:45,590
pretty good ad question uh whether it's

1256
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:49,500
those I wish all guys don't you shoot

1257
00:52:45,590 --> 00:52:51,840
exactly or for detection about the exact

1258
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:54,539
thing that they really should keep and

1259
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:59,460
where it is and it recommends us to

1260
00:52:54,539 --> 00:53:03,259
Center the Yuma image yeah if if you

1261
00:52:59,460 --> 00:53:06,030
start doing you know laser dissection or

1262
00:53:03,260 --> 00:53:08,120
protoplast thing and sorting you can

1263
00:53:06,030 --> 00:53:11,310
start seeing in these

1264
00:53:08,119 --> 00:53:14,359
epidermis needs a fill vascular tissue

1265
00:53:11,309 --> 00:53:16,440
in the leaf for example you can see

1266
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:19,530
slightly different profiles of different

1267
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:21,690
profiles of gene expression and and

1268
00:53:19,530 --> 00:53:24,769
different mutations affect different

1269
00:53:21,690 --> 00:53:26,990
clocks a different

1270
00:53:24,769 --> 00:53:28,579
specific clocks norm so we haven't done

1271
00:53:26,989 --> 00:53:30,469
any of that ourselves but that's

1272
00:53:28,579 --> 00:53:32,389
definitely a growth industry in the area

1273
00:53:30,469 --> 00:53:35,419
and we real everything I've shown you

1274
00:53:32,389 --> 00:53:39,259
and everything I've done is a leaf

1275
00:53:35,420 --> 00:53:42,380
lamina uh so predominantly means a fill

1276
00:53:39,260 --> 00:53:44,180
but with with epidermis in there and we

1277
00:53:42,380 --> 00:53:46,579
showed Todd Michael when he was a grad

1278
00:53:44,179 --> 00:53:48,319
student in my lab did some experiments

1279
00:53:46,579 --> 00:53:50,719
where he challenged a provided

1280
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:53,300
light-dark cycles or temperature cycles

1281
00:53:50,719 --> 00:53:54,889
and he would put them in opposition to

1282
00:53:53,300 --> 00:53:57,019
one another sort of this gladiator

1283
00:53:54,889 --> 00:53:59,089
experiment asked which is more important

1284
00:53:57,019 --> 00:54:00,889
and it turns out the answer depends on

1285
00:53:59,090 --> 00:54:05,480
which target you're looking at so

1286
00:54:00,889 --> 00:54:06,589
Musical Express gene like cab responded

1287
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:09,460
primarily to light rather than

1288
00:54:06,590 --> 00:54:11,660
temperature but an epidermal catalase

1289
00:54:09,460 --> 00:54:13,970
responded primarily to temperature

1290
00:54:11,659 --> 00:54:15,949
rather than light and so there's going

1291
00:54:13,969 --> 00:54:19,719
to be a great deal of complexity there

1292
00:54:15,949 --> 00:54:19,719
that is only beginning to be explored

1293
00:54:19,750 --> 00:54:24,619
yeah yeah so there are so many genes

1294
00:54:22,699 --> 00:54:27,139
involved in keeping this oscillating

1295
00:54:24,619 --> 00:54:30,469
Network going but would you look at qgl

1296
00:54:27,139 --> 00:54:31,819
you get you know a few big Peaks it

1297
00:54:30,469 --> 00:54:33,799
looks like and some of them are genes

1298
00:54:31,820 --> 00:54:36,940
that you know are in offices like two

1299
00:54:33,800 --> 00:54:40,430
guys yet is there anything about those

1300
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:42,019
QTL genes and their position in the core

1301
00:54:40,429 --> 00:54:44,960
expression network are they more

1302
00:54:42,019 --> 00:54:47,630
connected they occupy like traditional

1303
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:50,750
positions between modules that's

1304
00:54:47,630 --> 00:54:53,480
informative or we haven't seen that yet

1305
00:54:50,750 --> 00:54:56,119
but but but basically you know big

1306
00:54:53,480 --> 00:54:59,269
intervals and very few of the actual

1307
00:54:56,119 --> 00:55:03,109
genes have been identified Seth Davis

1308
00:54:59,269 --> 00:55:05,989
has identified elf free in one

1309
00:55:03,110 --> 00:55:07,700
population and we've identified gigantea

1310
00:55:05,989 --> 00:55:09,559
in a different species in a population

1311
00:55:07,699 --> 00:55:12,259
we have a good candidate for one in a

1312
00:55:09,559 --> 00:55:14,509
rabid office now but so we don't know

1313
00:55:12,260 --> 00:55:15,800
enough to know about that but also you

1314
00:55:14,510 --> 00:55:18,920
know the LOD scores are misleading

1315
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:21,470
because each one of those you know I

1316
00:55:18,920 --> 00:55:23,240
wish we had you know a really large

1317
00:55:21,469 --> 00:55:26,509
effect gene but each each one of these

1318
00:55:23,239 --> 00:55:30,769
QTL I think the largest one we've seen

1319
00:55:26,510 --> 00:55:32,960
is is accounting for 10 or 15 percent of

1320
00:55:30,769 --> 00:55:35,239
the variation in the trait so there

1321
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:36,769
aren't these are definitely not behaving

1322
00:55:35,239 --> 00:55:38,389
like Mendelian low side

1323
00:55:36,769 --> 00:55:40,489
you know they well

1324
00:55:38,389 --> 00:55:43,609
you know in it's not they're not large

1325
00:55:40,489 --> 00:55:47,679
effect so it makes it more challenging

1326
00:55:43,610 --> 00:55:50,180
but perhaps more interesting and you've

1327
00:55:47,679 --> 00:55:52,009
exactly articulated part of our

1328
00:55:50,179 --> 00:55:56,319
interests and in pursuing this will that

1329
00:55:52,010 --> 00:56:00,640
turn out to be true love and if it were

1330
00:55:56,320 --> 00:56:03,340
so you said you are showing that um

1331
00:56:00,639 --> 00:56:06,409
Klein of the month sentence would be

1332
00:56:03,340 --> 00:56:09,680
superhuman show Klein in clocks such as

1333
00:56:06,409 --> 00:56:11,719
the Icelandic population by and large

1334
00:56:09,679 --> 00:56:14,480
have a different kind of clock or I have

1335
00:56:11,719 --> 00:56:16,459
a difference and I know you say we can

1336
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:21,170
train but I'm asking whether there is a

1337
00:56:16,460 --> 00:56:24,380
genetic component to the clock uh I

1338
00:56:21,170 --> 00:56:26,659
don't know of any study that's been

1339
00:56:24,380 --> 00:56:30,019
looking geographically in that regard

1340
00:56:26,659 --> 00:56:34,069
but but we do know that there's a

1341
00:56:30,019 --> 00:56:37,519
genetic basis in the clock for a number

1342
00:56:34,070 --> 00:56:41,000
of human pathologies so advanced

1343
00:56:37,519 --> 00:56:43,400
familial sleep syndrome and delayed

1344
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:46,039
familiar suite syndrome underlying that

1345
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:51,039
are our mutations in canonical clock

1346
00:56:46,039 --> 00:56:53,840
genes like pers females and so on so

1347
00:56:51,039 --> 00:56:57,320
whether or not there will be a clock

1348
00:56:53,840 --> 00:56:59,590
function thing I I don't know if we've

1349
00:56:57,320 --> 00:57:01,760
been in those latitudes long enough uh

1350
00:56:59,590 --> 00:57:04,039
but it's a really interesting question

1351
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:07,270
to explore and people are starting to do

1352
00:57:04,039 --> 00:57:09,500
this more and more they've had to really

1353
00:57:07,269 --> 00:57:11,059
it used to be when I started in the

1354
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:13,940
field they thought that we all ran

1355
00:57:11,059 --> 00:57:15,559
really quite long and and that was you

1356
00:57:13,940 --> 00:57:16,760
know the way they did the studies has it

1357
00:57:15,559 --> 00:57:19,130
turns out it was an artifact because

1358
00:57:16,760 --> 00:57:20,630
they take somebody typically a PhD

1359
00:57:19,130 --> 00:57:22,309
student who wanted to write their thesis

1360
00:57:20,630 --> 00:57:22,970
or a professor who wanted to write their

1361
00:57:22,309 --> 00:57:25,579
monographs

1362
00:57:22,969 --> 00:57:27,319
and so they wanted to be left alone so

1363
00:57:25,579 --> 00:57:29,389
they volunteered for one of these cave

1364
00:57:27,320 --> 00:57:32,150
or bunker studies and they'd go you know

1365
00:57:29,389 --> 00:57:34,549
underground for some period of time and

1366
00:57:32,150 --> 00:57:35,930
write their thesis and then when they'd

1367
00:57:34,550 --> 00:57:37,390
open the door to let them out they'd say

1368
00:57:35,929 --> 00:57:40,129
hey no come on I'm counting the days

1369
00:57:37,389 --> 00:57:41,509
I've got another week to go here and I

1370
00:57:40,130 --> 00:57:43,070
haven't finished my last chapter but

1371
00:57:41,510 --> 00:57:44,720
that's because the clock was running a

1372
00:57:43,070 --> 00:57:46,490
little long but they gave him control of

1373
00:57:44,719 --> 00:57:49,099
the light switch and it turns out that

1374
00:57:46,489 --> 00:57:51,500
lights in the evening delay your clock

1375
00:57:49,099 --> 00:57:52,309
so just with the presence of light in

1376
00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:54,409
the evening they were

1377
00:57:52,309 --> 00:57:57,079
actually artificially lengthening the

1378
00:57:54,409 --> 00:57:58,849
period of their clock which is of course

1379
00:57:57,079 --> 00:57:59,869
why you don't do your email right before

1380
00:57:58,849 --> 00:58:02,420
bed

1381
00:57:59,869 --> 00:58:03,859
and and so now now to do these studies

1382
00:58:02,420 --> 00:58:07,099
it's not so fun because they strap you

1383
00:58:03,860 --> 00:58:08,930
down in a dim room and intubate you and

1384
00:58:07,099 --> 00:58:12,019
you know put an IV in and give you 200

1385
00:58:08,929 --> 00:58:14,659
calories every you know etc etc and our

1386
00:58:12,019 --> 00:58:17,659
period is much more as a species is much

1387
00:58:14,659 --> 00:58:19,399
closer to 24 hours than we thought and I

1388
00:58:17,659 --> 00:58:21,019
I don't know what the range is I think

1389
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:22,970
though I don't think they've done hurt a

1390
00:58:21,019 --> 00:58:26,449
lot of people yet but it would be really

1391
00:58:22,969 --> 00:58:28,009
interesting to look at maybe that's why

1392
00:58:26,449 --> 00:58:30,799
the Scandinavians are depressive or

1393
00:58:28,010 --> 00:58:32,630
something I don't know maybe it's

1394
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:35,480
because there's no Sun sports manic

1395
00:58:32,630 --> 00:58:39,440
manic depressive is right now I'm kind

1396
00:58:35,480 --> 00:58:42,829
of moving into the manic phase I love

1397
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:44,750
this time of year and maybe that's just

1398
00:58:42,829 --> 00:58:46,519
because it's been so dark for so long I

1399
00:58:44,750 --> 00:58:49,539
think the hannover weather is much like

1400
00:58:46,519 --> 00:58:52,579
the epic or whether she's in that regard

1401
00:58:49,539 --> 00:58:54,380
alright well people thanking their all

1402
00:58:52,579 --> 00:58:56,360
for the seminar the announcements for

1403
00:58:54,380 --> 00:59:01,119
the students are open utilized so please

1404
00:58:56,360 --> 00:59:01,120
come up to the seminar

1405
00:59:02,949 --> 00:59:11,769
this has been a production of Cornell

1406
