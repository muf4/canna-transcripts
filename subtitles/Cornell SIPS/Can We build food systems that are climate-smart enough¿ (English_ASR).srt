1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:05,339
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:05,339
University

3
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:12,550
okay so I'll start right in I'm going to

4
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:16,298
keep this my talk to actually about 30

5
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:18,219
minutes because we have some new farmer

6
00:00:16,298 --> 00:00:19,750
videos talking about climate change I'm

7
00:00:18,219 --> 00:00:21,070
going to reveal one of them to you today

8
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:22,689
at the end of my talk so I'm going to

9
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:25,929
save the 10 to 15 minutes at the end of

10
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:27,399
my talk to flip to a video so instead of

11
00:00:25,929 --> 00:00:31,059
just hearing from me you can also hear

12
00:00:27,399 --> 00:00:33,129
from some farmers so I want to point out

13
00:00:31,059 --> 00:00:34,719
a couple websites here if you haven't

14
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:36,969
seen the climate change cornell.edu

15
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:38,109
website i urge you to go there and

16
00:00:36,969 --> 00:00:39,339
subscribe to it it gives you

17
00:00:38,109 --> 00:00:41,018
announcements of things that are

18
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:43,390
happening a lot of stuff about for

19
00:00:41,018 --> 00:00:45,789
students courses research going on on

20
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:47,739
campus and the home website has lots of

21
00:00:45,789 --> 00:00:50,050
interesting features on what's what's in

22
00:00:47,738 --> 00:00:51,399
the news about climate etc and then the

23
00:00:50,049 --> 00:00:54,669
second website here the climate

24
00:00:51,399 --> 00:00:57,100
Institute cal cornell edu that's our new

25
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:59,620
Cornell Institute for climate change and

26
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:02,829
agriculture website which has a lot of

27
00:00:59,619 --> 00:01:06,340
cool stuff related particularly to my

28
00:01:02,829 --> 00:01:08,049
topic today today I'm going to focus

29
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:12,040
mostly for this group I'm going to focus

30
00:01:08,049 --> 00:01:14,170
mostly on the issues associated with the

31
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:17,320
northeastern US but I do have a few

32
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:19,900
slides on the global story and I will be

33
00:01:17,319 --> 00:01:22,000
giving a seminar next semester in

34
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:24,100
February in the seat pad seminar series

35
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,010
to get more into this but I thought we

36
00:01:24,099 --> 00:01:29,619
should start with the bigger picture so

37
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:30,910
the challenge we face regardless of

38
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:33,070
climate change whether or not we had

39
00:01:30,909 --> 00:01:34,509
climate change is we're going to by 2050

40
00:01:33,069 --> 00:01:36,789
we're going to need sixty percent more

41
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:39,780
food and that's going to have to

42
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:42,969
reproduce for an expanded population

43
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:45,579
also changing diets that is changing the

44
00:01:42,969 --> 00:01:47,469
the demands on resources and impacts on

45
00:01:45,579 --> 00:01:50,019
the environment as people for example

46
00:01:47,469 --> 00:01:51,989
increase meat consumption in certain

47
00:01:50,019 --> 00:01:53,769
developing parts of the world that

48
00:01:51,989 --> 00:01:56,500
increases the impacts on the environment

49
00:01:53,769 --> 00:02:01,149
and resources etc so we need a lot more

50
00:01:56,500 --> 00:02:04,359
food that's going to be on you know a

51
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:05,859
limited land and water resources 75% of

52
00:02:04,359 --> 00:02:07,420
that increase in food is going to have

53
00:02:05,859 --> 00:02:09,489
to come from producing more food from

54
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:11,709
the same amount of land and already

55
00:02:09,489 --> 00:02:14,650
about seventy percent of the potential

56
00:02:11,709 --> 00:02:16,210
for irrigation has been exhausted many

57
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:20,140
experts feel

58
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:22,060
the globe now climate change does great

59
00:02:20,139 --> 00:02:24,639
greatly exacerbates this challenge

60
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:26,830
because we add to that new problems with

61
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:28,719
heat stress in some regions changing

62
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:31,660
pest dynamics flooding and drought as

63
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:34,240
i'll go into today more detail and the

64
00:02:31,659 --> 00:02:36,490
adaptation capacity to climate change is

65
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:38,550
you know very unequal there's financial

66
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:40,659
barriers in many parts of the world

67
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:47,230
technological and also perception

68
00:02:40,659 --> 00:02:50,620
barriers about climate change this slide

69
00:02:47,229 --> 00:02:52,929
just illustrates the the added challenge

70
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:55,300
of climate change with regards to water

71
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:57,790
as I said even without climate change

72
00:02:55,300 --> 00:03:00,550
our water resources are limited in terms

73
00:02:57,789 --> 00:03:02,169
of trying to meet that future goal by

74
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:04,719
2050 of feeding the world's population

75
00:03:02,169 --> 00:03:07,679
is hopefully we stabilize around 2050 it

76
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:10,180
may be 9 billion or so this is showing

77
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,800
climate change projections of parts of

78
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:13,750
the world in the orange where we're

79
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:15,880
actually expecting less rainfall in the

80
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:19,780
future the climate models are projecting

81
00:03:15,879 --> 00:03:23,620
blue areas indicates slight increases

82
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:25,479
the white areas a little change and so

83
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:27,129
this course greatly adds to the problem

84
00:03:25,479 --> 00:03:29,469
because even in those areas such as if

85
00:03:27,129 --> 00:03:31,150
you look at where New York is where

86
00:03:29,469 --> 00:03:34,240
maybe there's little change in annual

87
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:36,280
rainfall predicted for the future the

88
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:39,700
water demand is going to increase with

89
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:41,310
longer growing seasons with increasing

90
00:03:39,699 --> 00:03:44,560
temperatures the crop evapotranspiration

91
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:46,930
and vegetate natural vegetation is

92
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,250
potentially t is going to be going up so

93
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:50,140
unless you have an increase in rainfall

94
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:52,180
to keep up with the increase in water

95
00:03:50,139 --> 00:03:53,589
demand there's challenges for more

96
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:55,599
droughts and of course in these areas in

97
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:57,219
orange we're on top of that you're not

98
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:59,919
seeing the same amount of rainfall that

99
00:03:57,219 --> 00:04:03,819
actually reductions the challenge is big

100
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:05,829
indeed so here's the story for the

101
00:04:03,819 --> 00:04:09,549
Northeast and in kind of a nutshell

102
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:12,280
looking at the range of climate models

103
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:14,110
and their future predictions on the

104
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:17,920
left-hand side for annual temperature

105
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:19,270
and on the right for rainfall and of

106
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:21,040
course there's you know error bars

107
00:04:19,269 --> 00:04:23,259
around both of these with the different

108
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,879
models and scenarios and the error bars

109
00:04:23,259 --> 00:04:25,649
are bigger for rainfall it's harder for

110
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:27,779
the climate

111
00:04:25,649 --> 00:04:30,870
to predict rainfall but if you look at

112
00:04:27,779 --> 00:04:34,258
the gray the gray region it shows kind

113
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:36,149
of the the most likely scenario and what

114
00:04:34,259 --> 00:04:37,770
you'll see is that for our region what's

115
00:04:36,149 --> 00:04:39,719
projected is like the rest of the world

116
00:04:37,769 --> 00:04:42,149
pretty substantial increases in

117
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:45,630
temperature rainfall annual rainfall

118
00:04:42,149 --> 00:04:48,029
possibly staying about roughly the same

119
00:04:45,629 --> 00:04:49,860
and what does that mean for us it means

120
00:04:48,029 --> 00:04:51,779
increased drought for those reasons I

121
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:54,240
just mentioned longer growing season

122
00:04:51,779 --> 00:04:56,879
farmers will be moving to longer growing

123
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:59,879
season varieties higher temperatures

124
00:04:56,879 --> 00:05:01,168
will increase crop demand so the need

125
00:04:59,879 --> 00:05:03,329
for irrigation particularly for

126
00:05:01,168 --> 00:05:05,639
high-value crops will be dramatically

127
00:05:03,329 --> 00:05:07,109
increased and even for things like our

128
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:09,629
grain corn that's so important to our

129
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:12,240
dairy industry could be challenging that

130
00:05:09,629 --> 00:05:14,579
more frequent summer droughts but on the

131
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,079
positive side we don't have we're not

132
00:05:14,579 --> 00:05:18,689
living in an area where rainfall is

133
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:20,759
predicted to be dramatically decreasing

134
00:05:18,689 --> 00:05:22,819
like in the southwestern US because that

135
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:25,649
would be even of course much worse so

136
00:05:22,819 --> 00:05:27,629
you could look at this optimistically or

137
00:05:25,649 --> 00:05:31,049
pessimistically that optimistic view of

138
00:05:27,629 --> 00:05:32,699
this is we will have water the negative

139
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:34,348
view is we still have more summer

140
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:36,360
drought risk than farmers have seen

141
00:05:34,348 --> 00:05:37,889
before but not the kind of risk of

142
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:41,220
things like the Finger Lakes drying up

143
00:05:37,889 --> 00:05:42,629
or something dramatic like that of

144
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:45,900
course this longer growing season thing

145
00:05:42,629 --> 00:05:48,000
is an opportunity for this region opens

146
00:05:45,899 --> 00:05:49,469
up the palette to new types of crops we

147
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,370
might grow and already we see farmers

148
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:55,139
exploring new crops new markets we've

149
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:58,590
already had this is the observed

150
00:05:55,139 --> 00:06:01,439
increase and the models all predict of

151
00:05:58,589 --> 00:06:03,779
course this thing this trend continuing

152
00:06:01,439 --> 00:06:06,478
so already seeing longer growing season

153
00:06:03,779 --> 00:06:08,279
length we are seeing already farmers

154
00:06:06,478 --> 00:06:10,800
exploring longer growing season

155
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:14,989
varieties to take advantage of this so

156
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:17,639
that's in fact a positive feature

157
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:19,170
however we have to remember that the

158
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:20,759
frost free period is not all that

159
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:23,400
determines the growing season length

160
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:24,990
we've had for example corn farmers in

161
00:06:23,399 --> 00:06:26,489
the state that are exploring longer

162
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:28,319
growing season corn varieties because

163
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:29,819
those are out in the field longer they

164
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:32,219
produce more than the short growing

165
00:06:29,819 --> 00:06:34,560
season varieties that they've

166
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:36,270
historically used but what they have

167
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,129
found is that in some years well we have

168
00:06:36,269 --> 00:06:40,289
may have record-breaking frost free

169
00:06:38,129 --> 00:06:42,329
periods they can't get into plant until

170
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:45,840
late june because it's so darn wet out

171
00:06:42,329 --> 00:06:48,750
there they can't plant so this just is

172
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:50,429
you know one of the interesting way to

173
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:52,649
illustrate that climate change is not

174
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:54,569
just about global warming it's other

175
00:06:52,649 --> 00:06:59,189
issues as well and we're having a very

176
00:06:54,569 --> 00:07:01,889
substantial observed increase in the

177
00:06:59,189 --> 00:07:04,920
frequency of high rainfall events as

178
00:07:01,889 --> 00:07:06,629
I'll talk about later many farmers not

179
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:09,090
only in the Northeast but in the Midwest

180
00:07:06,629 --> 00:07:11,149
as well are beginning to explore and

181
00:07:09,089 --> 00:07:14,310
actually putting investments into

182
00:07:11,149 --> 00:07:17,009
equipment to when there are windows of

183
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:20,250
opportunity to get in the field do more

184
00:07:17,009 --> 00:07:22,199
quickly so bigger planters bigger hey

185
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:23,970
harvesting equipment to get more acres

186
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:26,069
done more quickly farmers are making

187
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:27,750
that kind of adaptation because they

188
00:07:26,069 --> 00:07:29,339
feel that the windows are shrinking in

189
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:34,769
terms of times when they can get field

190
00:07:29,339 --> 00:07:37,500
access so as I mentioned this is again

191
00:07:34,769 --> 00:07:39,539
this is observed data this is not

192
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:41,579
talking about percent increase in total

193
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:44,580
rainfall but this is the increase in the

194
00:07:41,579 --> 00:07:47,250
frequency of days in a year when we have

195
00:07:44,579 --> 00:07:49,109
very high rainfall events and you can

196
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:51,060
see if this is a phenomenon across the

197
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:52,500
northern hemisphere it has to do with in

198
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:54,600
a warmer world there's more water vapor

199
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:56,399
more of the world's water is up in the

200
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:58,220
air is water vapor as we warm our world

201
00:07:56,399 --> 00:08:00,539
then if you have an upper atmosphere

202
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:01,980
condensation vent to cause rain there's

203
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:04,560
more there to come down that's kind of a

204
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:06,660
basic theoretical reason for this where

205
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:08,879
to come down comes down is very hard to

206
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:10,700
predict but you can see in the Northeast

207
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:12,779
we're the real prize winner in the u.s.

208
00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:15,680
seventy-four percent increase in these

209
00:08:12,779 --> 00:08:15,679
high-level events

210
00:08:16,939 --> 00:08:21,090
another challenge for us in the

211
00:08:19,348 --> 00:08:23,938
Northeast you know an advantage we've

212
00:08:21,089 --> 00:08:25,978
had compared to regions south of here is

213
00:08:23,939 --> 00:08:28,050
we've had less pest and weed pressure

214
00:08:25,978 --> 00:08:30,899
because a lot of things can't survive

215
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:33,538
our cold winters but of course in a

216
00:08:30,899 --> 00:08:35,309
warming world warmer winters many

217
00:08:33,538 --> 00:08:38,360
innocent insects will benefit abled

218
00:08:35,309 --> 00:08:41,038
overwinter more generations per season

219
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:43,050
northward expansion of rate of range and

220
00:08:41,038 --> 00:08:44,639
these are just the flea beetle a vector

221
00:08:43,049 --> 00:08:48,629
of Stuart's world an important disease

222
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:50,159
of sweet corn and corn earworm big

223
00:08:48,629 --> 00:08:53,278
problem with sweet corn both of these

224
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:54,778
are insects that are coming earlier and

225
00:08:53,278 --> 00:08:57,360
becoming more of a problem in Northeast

226
00:08:54,778 --> 00:09:00,208
with our warmer winters kudzu we modeled

227
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:02,370
in about ten years ago we modeled that

228
00:09:00,208 --> 00:09:03,389
kudzu would likely be moving north from

229
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:06,389
the south where it's been a very

230
00:09:03,389 --> 00:09:08,639
terrible base of weed and indeed it is

231
00:09:06,389 --> 00:09:12,328
coming up here as our winters get warmer

232
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:15,899
so that's a new challenge for us so how

233
00:09:12,328 --> 00:09:19,588
about farmers respond to that probably

234
00:09:15,899 --> 00:09:21,089
more pesticides herbicides etc needed

235
00:09:19,589 --> 00:09:23,519
and that's something where we have to

236
00:09:21,089 --> 00:09:25,230
think about you know the issues the

237
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:26,909
policy issues of protecting our

238
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:28,769
waterways from increase chemical inputs

239
00:09:26,909 --> 00:09:30,539
about allowing our farmers to adapt to

240
00:09:28,769 --> 00:09:34,409
climate change so some new challenges

241
00:09:30,539 --> 00:09:35,879
there one thing I certainly learned you

242
00:09:34,409 --> 00:09:38,159
know being involved nuh since the 1990s

243
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:42,059
is we really have to expect the

244
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:43,439
unexpected one of the farmer groups that

245
00:09:42,059 --> 00:09:45,359
calls me out more often than others to

246
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,250
talk about climate change is the fruit

247
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:50,430
growers and it's not about heat stress

248
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:52,620
it's about more frost damage and freeze

249
00:09:50,429 --> 00:09:54,899
damage that they anecdotally feel that

250
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:57,959
they are experiencing and indeed we've

251
00:09:54,899 --> 00:10:01,828
had a increased frequency in the past

252
00:09:57,958 --> 00:10:05,369
several years of either mid winter

253
00:10:01,828 --> 00:10:08,219
freeze problems or premature bloom for

254
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:09,839
example in 2012 most of you know apples

255
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:11,940
bloomed record-breaking four weeks

256
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:15,449
earlier than normal a long window of

257
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:17,470
frost threat and indeed we lost millions

258
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:19,750
of dollars across the state in

259
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:21,279
and apple production and we're currently

260
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:22,840
working we don't have a lot of answers

261
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:25,959
about this now we're working we have in

262
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:27,250
my lab group a Apple Bloom model and

263
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:29,590
trying to look at that in relation to

264
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:30,970
various climate change scenarios is this

265
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:34,240
really going to be part and parcel of

266
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:36,100
climate change or is this simply these

267
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:38,409
recent events simply part of normal

268
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:40,779
weather variability and it's the classic

269
00:10:38,409 --> 00:10:42,549
challenge of how do we detect a real

270
00:10:40,779 --> 00:10:44,110
climate change signal against the

271
00:10:42,549 --> 00:10:46,419
background noise of real weather

272
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:48,190
variability and the jury's still out on

273
00:10:46,419 --> 00:10:51,729
this one so we're still doing research

274
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:55,030
on this here's this a laundry list of

275
00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:57,220
you know farm level adjustments what

276
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:58,629
farmers were beginning at this point I

277
00:10:57,220 --> 00:11:01,690
couldn't have said this ten years ago

278
00:10:58,629 --> 00:11:03,789
but at this point i can say i can think

279
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:05,950
of examples why farmers are actually

280
00:11:03,789 --> 00:11:08,529
doing some other things on this list

281
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:10,870
right now they might not all have even

282
00:11:08,529 --> 00:11:15,189
recognized that these were climate

283
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:18,190
change adaptation responses some of them

284
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:19,660
just their common sense about good

285
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:21,490
business and realizing they're getting

286
00:11:19,659 --> 00:11:23,199
hit over and over with certain kinds of

287
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:25,450
problems making certain kinds of

288
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:28,030
investments to deal with what they would

289
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:30,670
call unusual weather patterns perhaps

290
00:11:28,029 --> 00:11:32,169
rather than calling a climate change but

291
00:11:30,669 --> 00:11:34,360
certainly in the livestock dairy

292
00:11:32,169 --> 00:11:36,189
industry we see farmers thinking more

293
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:37,870
carefully about if we're putting up a

294
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:40,330
new barn making sure it has better

295
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:43,299
cooling capacity milk production cows

296
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:45,129
like it really cool and milk production

297
00:11:43,299 --> 00:11:49,949
declines that even temperatures in the

298
00:11:45,129 --> 00:11:51,850
mid-80s at high humidity so a lot of

299
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:54,310
interest there was recently this past

300
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:56,139
summer in July I spoke out and was a

301
00:11:54,309 --> 00:11:59,049
very good conference here on dairy and

302
00:11:56,139 --> 00:12:01,269
climate change and there were some

303
00:11:59,049 --> 00:12:03,129
farmers there and quite a few people

304
00:12:01,269 --> 00:12:05,230
very interested in this topic in the

305
00:12:03,129 --> 00:12:06,909
crop solo water management area one of

306
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:08,560
the big issues like all aspects of

307
00:12:06,909 --> 00:12:11,439
climate change really is diversifying

308
00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:13,479
kind of hedging your bets so instead of

309
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:17,170
having one planting time having several

310
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:20,110
planting time so hopefully 11 staggered

311
00:12:17,169 --> 00:12:20,939
planting they do well in a year even

312
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:23,850
when another

313
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:25,380
another planting date might be at a

314
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:27,300
certain stage when there's a certain

315
00:12:25,379 --> 00:12:30,360
kind of let's say mid summer drought or

316
00:12:27,299 --> 00:12:31,709
something that it's vulnerable or you

317
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:34,200
know mixing it up with varieties and

318
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:36,030
crops and new crops the one disadvantage

319
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:37,770
that I had none of these are really

320
00:12:36,029 --> 00:12:40,439
costs to risk free even the simplest

321
00:12:37,769 --> 00:12:43,350
strategy of diversifying of course if

322
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:45,840
you have a year that's like the good old

323
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:47,610
years and sort of perfect for the crop

324
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:49,440
you used to grow but you've now

325
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:51,330
diversified into a few different crops

326
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:53,760
to hedge your bets well you might not

327
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:55,620
make as much money as if you have stayed

328
00:12:53,759 --> 00:12:57,870
with your old crop so so this

329
00:12:55,620 --> 00:13:00,750
diversifying thing does sometimes in a

330
00:12:57,870 --> 00:13:02,639
really quote good year farmers may make

331
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:04,710
less money on the other hand they are

332
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:06,750
buffered from effects in bad years I

333
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:08,340
mentioned the wii disease and insect

334
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:12,539
pests we really just need to stay on top

335
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:18,240
of tracking insect we disease pests and

336
00:13:12,539 --> 00:13:20,009
we need ipm more than ever Don mentioned

337
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,269
my interest in soils and Cornell so

338
00:13:20,009 --> 00:13:22,980
health program that's something I'm very

339
00:13:21,269 --> 00:13:25,169
involved with and all I've got a slide

340
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:26,870
later talking about the importance of so

341
00:13:25,169 --> 00:13:30,779
health in terms of buffering us from

342
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:33,570
from drought radiation and drainage

343
00:13:30,779 --> 00:13:34,409
systems and this can be even the kind of

344
00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:36,810
thing we're beginning to see some

345
00:13:34,409 --> 00:13:38,309
farmers do is kind of wrap these two

346
00:13:36,809 --> 00:13:40,799
together for example having better

347
00:13:38,309 --> 00:13:43,439
drainage systems to protect from floods

348
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:45,929
developing ditch systems on a farm to

349
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:47,880
quickly get a water away from flood

350
00:13:45,929 --> 00:13:50,219
prone areas but then moving that water

351
00:13:47,879 --> 00:13:51,799
into small reservoir so if a month later

352
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:54,540
they've got a short-term summer drought

353
00:13:51,799 --> 00:13:57,870
they've got some water there to irrigate

354
00:13:54,539 --> 00:14:00,269
with fruit crop frost protection and

355
00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:02,879
then as I mentioned earlier larger scale

356
00:14:00,269 --> 00:14:04,379
farm equipment is it something we read

357
00:14:02,879 --> 00:14:07,080
in ourselves really think of a few years

358
00:14:04,379 --> 00:14:09,480
ago but we see farmers going to this as

359
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:11,070
a way of covering more acreage faster

360
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:16,039
because they feel like they've got these

361
00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:16,040
shrinking windows for for field access

362
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:21,540
that laundry list of things as I

363
00:14:18,779 --> 00:14:23,459
mentioned already you know it's not but

364
00:14:21,539 --> 00:14:25,679
none of them are costs to risk free so

365
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:27,210
the problem for farmers is you know it's

366
00:14:25,679 --> 00:14:29,279
a really time for me to think about

367
00:14:27,210 --> 00:14:30,810
doing something different and most of

368
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:34,019
those doing something different things

369
00:14:30,809 --> 00:14:37,019
means some investment in labor money

370
00:14:34,019 --> 00:14:38,970
certain kinds of risks and so this is

371
00:14:37,019 --> 00:14:40,860
the this is kind of where we're at at

372
00:14:38,970 --> 00:14:43,379
Cornell and any other places trying to

373
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:45,870
support farmer adaptation is providing

374
00:14:43,379 --> 00:14:48,659
support services to farmers to help them

375
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:50,340
make those decisions that's what the

376
00:14:48,659 --> 00:14:52,949
Cornell Institute for climate change and

377
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:55,500
AG very much focused on his new tools

378
00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:58,190
for farmers to help them give them the

379
00:14:55,500 --> 00:15:00,750
information to make wise decisions

380
00:14:58,190 --> 00:15:03,450
perhaps in some cases that may be why is

381
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:04,860
the wait a year or two in other cases it

382
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:06,629
may be they should have made that change

383
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:12,629
years ago and it's definitely time to

384
00:15:06,629 --> 00:15:14,399
make the shift this is another trend I

385
00:15:12,629 --> 00:15:17,580
we see happening in terms of helping

386
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:19,679
farmers cope with climate but it's

387
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:22,800
really not that much focused on climate

388
00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:25,199
change it's really what we call seasonal

389
00:15:22,799 --> 00:15:27,240
climate forecasting so in addition to

390
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:30,060
Prime trying to provide farmers with

391
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:31,950
simply better weather forecasts you know

392
00:15:30,059 --> 00:15:34,259
instead of five days out seven days

393
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:36,030
twelve days out really provide better

394
00:15:34,259 --> 00:15:37,649
information that gives them a better

395
00:15:36,029 --> 00:15:40,740
idea of what the whole season is going

396
00:15:37,649 --> 00:15:42,629
to look like and 11 certain parts of the

397
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:44,009
world where we can really do this our

398
00:15:42,629 --> 00:15:46,320
parts of the world which are very

399
00:15:44,009 --> 00:15:50,039
sensitive to these El Nino La Nina

400
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:51,870
cycles unfortunately the Northeast is

401
00:15:50,039 --> 00:15:54,120
not an area that's particularly

402
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:55,710
sensitive to those cycles so as you can

403
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:58,230
see with this map here this is happens

404
00:15:55,710 --> 00:16:00,210
to be a map showing January looking at

405
00:15:58,230 --> 00:16:02,789
the historical record for strong El Nino

406
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:05,310
years and the white areas are areas

407
00:16:02,789 --> 00:16:08,159
where really there's little change from

408
00:16:05,309 --> 00:16:10,859
normal quote normal in terms of rain

409
00:16:08,159 --> 00:16:12,649
rainfall in January and the green areas

410
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:16,740
and blue areas are areas whether

411
00:16:12,649 --> 00:16:18,809
substantial increases in rainfall in El

412
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:21,750
Nino years but you can see if you're a

413
00:16:18,809 --> 00:16:23,899
farmer in Florida or California having

414
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:25,639
information on whether it's an L need

415
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:29,329
gives you very good information on

416
00:16:25,639 --> 00:16:30,679
upcoming potential rainfall forecast now

417
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:33,520
this is only as good as a historical

418
00:16:30,679 --> 00:16:36,859
record they simply do a relationship

419
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:39,199
between historical El Nino years and

420
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:41,470
what happened in those years in I've

421
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:44,150
spent my last sabbatical leave at

422
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:45,920
University of Florida and because that

423
00:16:44,149 --> 00:16:47,840
area is so sensitive these El Nino

424
00:16:45,919 --> 00:16:50,029
cycles they have it you can actually

425
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:51,410
there's a really great website to agro

426
00:16:50,029 --> 00:16:53,269
climate website they have there for

427
00:16:51,409 --> 00:16:54,889
farmers you can put where your farm is

428
00:16:53,269 --> 00:16:57,649
and it gives you month-to-month

429
00:16:54,889 --> 00:17:00,379
information on all kinds of issues about

430
00:16:57,649 --> 00:17:02,000
El Nino or La Nina years so once you

431
00:17:00,379 --> 00:17:03,649
know what kind of year were having like

432
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,660
this year happens to be a very strong

433
00:17:03,649 --> 00:17:07,940
island you know year the farmer can look

434
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:09,800
and see month by month what kind of

435
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:11,870
deviations from normal temperature and

436
00:17:09,799 --> 00:17:13,730
rainfall they might have so the

437
00:17:11,869 --> 00:17:16,759
challenge for the Northeast is actually

438
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:18,588
coming up with something like El Nino

439
00:17:16,759 --> 00:17:20,690
but it's got it El Nino doesn't work

440
00:17:18,588 --> 00:17:22,399
that well for us and Toby Alton our

441
00:17:20,690 --> 00:17:24,650
earth an aspheric sciences department

442
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:26,720
here at Cornell is working very hard at

443
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:28,670
looking at other things that might be

444
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:30,650
clues to give our farmers seasonal

445
00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:33,230
forecasts I mean it could be who knows

446
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:36,380
what you know a warmer summer in Calgary

447
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:38,000
Canada may mean a wetter spring in the

448
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:39,800
Northeast and even if it's a black box

449
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,779
thing like that if it has high

450
00:17:39,799 --> 00:17:46,609
probabilities it could be useful to our

451
00:17:41,779 --> 00:17:48,519
farmers universities are all about this

452
00:17:46,609 --> 00:17:51,349
farmers are getting on top of this and

453
00:17:48,519 --> 00:17:54,160
industries also seeing the opportunity I

454
00:17:51,349 --> 00:17:56,359
was out in San Francisco for the

455
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:58,400
American Geophysical Union conference a

456
00:17:56,359 --> 00:18:00,649
few years ago visited this new company

457
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:04,550
it was kind of mostly a lot of guys from

458
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:07,220
google men and women from google really

459
00:18:04,549 --> 00:18:08,899
just good with analyzing data satellite

460
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:10,970
data and everything developed this thing

461
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:12,950
called the climate corporation to give

462
00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:15,470
farmers everything that we've got to

463
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:17,660
bear these days with what's happening

464
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:19,279
with climate satellite data bring it all

465
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:22,460
to bear on their farm giving them

466
00:18:19,279 --> 00:18:24,649
information to guide their their their

467
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:26,539
farm practices focus pretty much on the

468
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:29,150
Midwest when I was there two three years

469
00:18:26,539 --> 00:18:31,538
ago it was a really cool office you know

470
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:34,809
typical Google office you know

471
00:18:31,538 --> 00:18:36,128
no no up walls between the offices and

472
00:18:34,808 --> 00:18:38,079
all these young people is really very

473
00:18:36,128 --> 00:18:40,868
exciting place they hadn't yet made any

474
00:18:38,079 --> 00:18:46,658
money Monsanto bought the not for a

475
00:18:40,868 --> 00:18:49,449
billion dollars last year one thing we

476
00:18:46,659 --> 00:18:51,159
worry about our financial barriers of

477
00:18:49,450 --> 00:18:53,288
course well all farmers have access to

478
00:18:51,159 --> 00:18:55,119
some of these new tools equity issues

479
00:18:53,288 --> 00:18:56,919
have the capital strategic information

480
00:18:55,118 --> 00:18:58,449
to death so that's a whole social

481
00:18:56,919 --> 00:19:02,229
science tissue that kind of goes along

482
00:18:58,450 --> 00:19:04,359
with our climate change story and work

483
00:19:02,229 --> 00:19:06,220
and we have a lot of social scientists

484
00:19:04,358 --> 00:19:09,220
at Cornell getting very engaged with us

485
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:11,470
on this issue and also internationally

486
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:13,269
as well I was just in Malawi working

487
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:16,960
with Rachel Besner occur in the

488
00:19:13,269 --> 00:19:19,419
development sociology department here

489
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:21,909
and working with farmers there on

490
00:19:19,419 --> 00:19:24,340
climate change and a lot of issues for

491
00:19:21,909 --> 00:19:25,599
those small and holder farmers so at the

492
00:19:24,339 --> 00:19:28,148
global issue we also of course have

493
00:19:25,598 --> 00:19:31,148
equity issues there's a whole I'm

494
00:19:28,148 --> 00:19:32,768
focusing a lot on crop production for

495
00:19:31,148 --> 00:19:35,498
the audience today but of course this

496
00:19:32,769 --> 00:19:37,598
whole issues with distribution waste

497
00:19:35,499 --> 00:19:39,848
management and all of that things sort

498
00:19:37,598 --> 00:19:44,710
of thing and a lot of big issues there

499
00:19:39,848 --> 00:19:46,239
to deal with so in my last few slides I

500
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:48,190
want to talk a little bit about the

501
00:19:46,239 --> 00:19:49,899
other side of the coin which is not

502
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:51,970
simply coping with climate change

503
00:19:49,898 --> 00:19:56,199
farmers learning to deal with sort of

504
00:19:51,970 --> 00:19:58,739
some inevitable changes in the weather

505
00:19:56,200 --> 00:20:00,788
patterns that they're seeing but also

506
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:02,950
what can they do to improve energy

507
00:20:00,788 --> 00:20:04,479
efficiency at the same time improve

508
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:07,359
their bottom line and actually farmers

509
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:09,519
are all about this in many ways I mean

510
00:20:07,358 --> 00:20:12,210
farmers went to diesel engines decades

511
00:20:09,519 --> 00:20:15,638
ago before climate change was a problem

512
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:17,499
not because of climate change or because

513
00:20:15,638 --> 00:20:19,329
of the goodness of their heart they felt

514
00:20:17,499 --> 00:20:21,278
like improving energy efficiency but it

515
00:20:19,329 --> 00:20:23,499
saved them money and so farmers are

516
00:20:21,278 --> 00:20:26,440
really excited about renewable energy

517
00:20:23,499 --> 00:20:30,940
opportunities on the farm and very open

518
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:35,320
to this biofuel crops you know it's a

519
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:36,879
big complicated controversial issue it

520
00:20:35,319 --> 00:20:38,950
makes a lot of sense from the standpoint

521
00:20:36,878 --> 00:20:41,019
of instead of bringing new carbon from

522
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:43,210
fossil fuels buried deep in the earth up

523
00:20:41,019 --> 00:20:44,769
to our climate system

524
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:47,409
and having to deal with that carbon for

525
00:20:44,769 --> 00:20:49,750
a long time to come recycling carbon

526
00:20:47,409 --> 00:20:51,490
through biofuel crops however of course

527
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:53,169
it makes a big difference how you grow

528
00:20:51,490 --> 00:20:56,220
that crop if you use a lot of fossil

529
00:20:53,169 --> 00:20:59,140
fuels to grow the crop you kind of

530
00:20:56,220 --> 00:21:01,390
spoiled the advantage of it if you're

531
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:04,210
using food crops you could compete for

532
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:06,159
food prices and and then where you go to

533
00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:08,200
if you're competing with prime

534
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:10,809
agricultural land those issues like that

535
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:12,580
to deal with but from a simply

536
00:21:10,808 --> 00:21:16,798
theoretical standpoint there is some

537
00:21:12,579 --> 00:21:19,269
good sense behind the biofuel crop thing

538
00:21:16,798 --> 00:21:21,788
re coupling animal and crop production

539
00:21:19,269 --> 00:21:23,408
systems I don't know to see when you see

540
00:21:21,788 --> 00:21:28,509
that picture but I see nitrogen carbon

541
00:21:23,409 --> 00:21:30,130
and energy and as you'll well at the

542
00:21:28,509 --> 00:21:31,839
website the farm video you're going to

543
00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:34,899
see today is about adaptation but at our

544
00:21:31,839 --> 00:21:37,269
climate change website we have a similar

545
00:21:34,898 --> 00:21:39,308
farmer video talking about mitigation

546
00:21:37,269 --> 00:21:40,808
and there you'll hear a number of dairy

547
00:21:39,308 --> 00:21:42,849
farmers talking about anaerobic

548
00:21:40,808 --> 00:21:45,158
digesters to deal with manure waste and

549
00:21:42,849 --> 00:21:47,648
get free energy for the farm and also

550
00:21:45,159 --> 00:21:51,820
deal with odor problems on the farm and

551
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:53,589
things like that it surprises some

552
00:21:51,819 --> 00:21:55,569
people to learn that when you look at

553
00:21:53,589 --> 00:21:57,819
the developed world a place like the

554
00:21:55,569 --> 00:22:00,839
United States in particular and if you

555
00:21:57,819 --> 00:22:03,428
do things on the co2 equivalent basis

556
00:22:00,839 --> 00:22:05,408
the big problem on our farms in terms of

557
00:22:03,429 --> 00:22:07,330
the big contributor of agriculture to

558
00:22:05,409 --> 00:22:09,700
climate change in a place like a u.s. is

559
00:22:07,329 --> 00:22:12,699
not co2 emissions from tractor driving

560
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:15,548
but nitrous oxide emissions that's

561
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:17,850
because nitrous oxide is 300 times more

562
00:22:15,548 --> 00:22:21,009
potent on a molecule for molecule basis

563
00:22:17,849 --> 00:22:24,278
than co2 it's released in trace amounts

564
00:22:21,009 --> 00:22:26,470
about 1% of a nitrogen fertilizer put

565
00:22:24,278 --> 00:22:28,480
onto land goes up into the air as

566
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:31,149
nitrous oxide even if you're using

567
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:33,190
manures organic sources of nitrogen this

568
00:22:31,148 --> 00:22:36,398
is the case of course if you're using

569
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:37,899
manures or organic sources you do reduce

570
00:22:36,398 --> 00:22:40,109
your carbon footprint because you're not

571
00:22:37,898 --> 00:22:43,119
you're not paying for the embedded

572
00:22:40,109 --> 00:22:45,219
carbon footprint of the manufacturer of

573
00:22:43,119 --> 00:22:47,918
the nitrogen but still even manure

574
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:49,798
sources released nitrous oxide so a key

575
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:53,049
to this story for the developed world

576
00:22:49,798 --> 00:22:54,960
and farming is better nitrogen

577
00:22:53,048 --> 00:22:58,319
management here at Cornell we have this

578
00:22:54,960 --> 00:23:00,179
adapt in tulle many of you may have

579
00:22:58,319 --> 00:23:01,230
heard about Harold on this has been

580
00:23:00,179 --> 00:23:04,190
quite involved with it I've been

581
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:06,839
involved in some ways to whether based

582
00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:09,269
precision nitrogen management tool been

583
00:23:06,839 --> 00:23:10,589
very successful with corn farmers and

584
00:23:09,269 --> 00:23:13,648
we're beginning to look into expanding

585
00:23:10,589 --> 00:23:15,898
it to other crops as well uses real-time

586
00:23:13,648 --> 00:23:17,819
weather to figure out what the nitrogen

587
00:23:15,898 --> 00:23:19,859
mineralization rate is so that farmers

588
00:23:17,819 --> 00:23:21,990
can account for basically the free

589
00:23:19,859 --> 00:23:24,990
nitrogen due to microbial activity in

590
00:23:21,990 --> 00:23:28,190
the spring and it's now been

591
00:23:24,990 --> 00:23:31,500
commercialized available in 26 States I

592
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:33,840
mentioned soil health you know I look at

593
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:35,069
this as both the building soil organic

594
00:23:33,839 --> 00:23:36,629
matter something we're talking to

595
00:23:35,069 --> 00:23:38,668
farmers about for many years for crop

596
00:23:36,630 --> 00:23:40,919
productivity but it's both an adaptation

597
00:23:38,669 --> 00:23:44,038
to climate change in terms of increasing

598
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:45,360
resilience to drought and flooding high

599
00:23:44,038 --> 00:23:47,308
organic matter means better water

600
00:23:45,359 --> 00:23:48,898
holding capacity and drainage and it's

601
00:23:47,308 --> 00:23:53,428
also carbon in the soil at otherwise

602
00:23:48,898 --> 00:23:54,808
it'd be in the air as co2 now in

603
00:23:53,429 --> 00:23:56,669
developing countries when we talk about

604
00:23:54,808 --> 00:23:58,109
mitigation it's not about nitrogen

605
00:23:56,669 --> 00:24:00,059
fertilizer they don't use a lot of

606
00:23:58,109 --> 00:24:03,298
nitrogen fertilizer a lot of it has to

607
00:24:00,058 --> 00:24:06,178
do with moving plot to plot quickly

608
00:24:03,298 --> 00:24:07,440
depleting soul resources and doing a lot

609
00:24:06,179 --> 00:24:09,269
of slash and burn agriculture

610
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:11,730
deforestation to feed a growing

611
00:24:09,269 --> 00:24:14,308
population and it's a significant part

612
00:24:11,730 --> 00:24:16,019
of global co2 emissions our social of

613
00:24:14,308 --> 00:24:17,428
deforestation and a lot of that

614
00:24:16,019 --> 00:24:19,710
deforestation is associated with

615
00:24:17,429 --> 00:24:21,778
agriculture so in the developed

616
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:24,419
developing world a lot of the emphasis

617
00:24:21,778 --> 00:24:26,788
is really on improving maintaining high

618
00:24:24,419 --> 00:24:29,309
quality soils so this process can be

619
00:24:26,788 --> 00:24:31,259
slowed in maximizing production from my

620
00:24:29,308 --> 00:24:34,319
land just mention a one project i'm

621
00:24:31,259 --> 00:24:35,609
involved with in zambia there's a paper

622
00:24:34,319 --> 00:24:38,609
and preceding national academy of

623
00:24:35,609 --> 00:24:41,009
sciences that goes into details it's a

624
00:24:38,609 --> 00:24:42,839
co-op of actually about 20,000 small

625
00:24:41,009 --> 00:24:45,869
land holder farmers very poor farmers

626
00:24:42,839 --> 00:24:48,418
and some years ago they got involved in

627
00:24:45,869 --> 00:24:50,099
working together on developing soil

628
00:24:48,419 --> 00:24:52,288
building processes to help their

629
00:24:50,099 --> 00:24:54,359
productivity but we've also been working

630
00:24:52,288 --> 00:24:56,509
with them on entering carbon markets to

631
00:24:54,359 --> 00:24:58,709
get credit for that they have been

632
00:24:56,509 --> 00:25:01,140
growing these that tree down there in

633
00:24:58,710 --> 00:25:03,470
the middle in the center is a fader BIA

634
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:06,480
albida tree and nitrogen fixing tree

635
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:08,429
they planted 700,000 of those into

636
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:10,048
dropping those in their land area for

637
00:25:08,429 --> 00:25:13,309
getting basically nitrogen for their

638
00:25:10,048 --> 00:25:16,529
crops but those trees also store carbon

639
00:25:13,308 --> 00:25:18,418
so it's a kind of a win-win scenario

640
00:25:16,529 --> 00:25:20,250
they've done a great job of marketing

641
00:25:18,419 --> 00:25:22,259
their products they have a website

642
00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:24,720
called it's wild org if you want to

643
00:25:22,259 --> 00:25:26,339
check it out and they market their own

644
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:30,179
peanut butter for example and I'm really

645
00:25:26,339 --> 00:25:32,279
doing cool things and this gets into you

646
00:25:30,179 --> 00:25:34,740
know what we eat and so deciding to buy

647
00:25:32,279 --> 00:25:36,089
from a place like fat is a consumer

648
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:38,669
choice and I just wanted to mention

649
00:25:36,089 --> 00:25:41,159
since we I did mention food systems and

650
00:25:38,669 --> 00:25:43,679
we all of us as consumers affect farmer

651
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:45,058
choices and the sustainability in carbon

652
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:49,019
footprint of Agriculture so we can think

653
00:25:45,058 --> 00:25:50,339
more about what we're eating just a

654
00:25:49,019 --> 00:25:53,519
couple more slides then I'll show the

655
00:25:50,339 --> 00:25:55,649
farmer video wanted to kind of put these

656
00:25:53,519 --> 00:25:57,450
things together and say that you know

657
00:25:55,650 --> 00:25:58,740
sustainable development sustainable AG

658
00:25:57,450 --> 00:26:02,069
development and climate changes are

659
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:03,990
linked in many ways and kind of two big

660
00:26:02,069 --> 00:26:06,149
ways both on the mitigation and in the

661
00:26:03,990 --> 00:26:07,890
adaptation end so using sustainable

662
00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:10,740
farming practices can help reduce

663
00:26:07,890 --> 00:26:14,640
greenhouse gases sequester carbon and it

664
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:17,910
buffers the farmer from climate change

665
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:19,740
in terms of I mentioned earlier drought

666
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:23,940
and flooding water holding capacity and

667
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:26,250
drainage of soils when I've talked to

668
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:28,529
farmers almost no matter well no matter

669
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:30,808
where I've been in the world there are

670
00:26:28,529 --> 00:26:33,000
some common ground and some places to

671
00:26:30,808 --> 00:26:34,918
enter the conversation of course in this

672
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:37,109
country not so much in other places I go

673
00:26:34,919 --> 00:26:38,429
to but in this country as we all know

674
00:26:37,109 --> 00:26:41,129
the climate change issues become very

675
00:26:38,429 --> 00:26:43,320
politicized but I've never met a farmer

676
00:26:41,130 --> 00:26:44,850
here or anywhere there's not concerned

677
00:26:43,319 --> 00:26:46,589
about extreme weather events and

678
00:26:44,849 --> 00:26:48,418
uncertainty about the weather and that's

679
00:26:46,589 --> 00:26:50,339
the way we begin the conversation every

680
00:26:48,419 --> 00:26:51,600
farmer is concerned about that and as

681
00:26:50,339 --> 00:26:53,639
you'll see in our farmer video will show

682
00:26:51,599 --> 00:26:54,808
you in a second some of them are a

683
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:56,370
little reticent to use the phrase

684
00:26:54,808 --> 00:26:57,779
climate change but they're all concerned

685
00:26:56,369 --> 00:26:59,879
about those issues and doing things to

686
00:26:57,779 --> 00:27:01,649
deal with them bummers have the same

687
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:04,700
problem we all do including climate

688
00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:06,900
scientist detecting you know a real

689
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:09,179
climate change trend that they should

690
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:10,470
invest in against the noise of weather

691
00:27:09,179 --> 00:27:12,150
variability and that's part of the job

692
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:14,190
of climate scientists that place like

693
00:27:12,150 --> 00:27:16,169
Cornell help them figure that out and

694
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:17,900
then on the mitigation end I mean

695
00:27:16,169 --> 00:27:21,490
farmers are all concerned about energy

696
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:23,030
that all interested in future energy

697
00:27:21,490 --> 00:27:24,589
renewables and that kind of thing

698
00:27:23,029 --> 00:27:27,259
however they're also very concerned

699
00:27:24,589 --> 00:27:29,449
about climate change policies so this is

700
00:27:27,259 --> 00:27:30,980
something where we have to consider

701
00:27:29,450 --> 00:27:33,799
where they're coming from many farmers

702
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:35,750
are more afraid of the policy reaction

703
00:27:33,799 --> 00:27:37,819
to climate change and climate change per

704
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:39,170
se they think of like things like carbon

705
00:27:37,819 --> 00:27:41,720
tax is affecting their transportation

706
00:27:39,170 --> 00:27:45,320
costs etc so we have to keep all of that

707
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:52,339
in mind and with that I want to turn it

708
00:27:45,319 --> 00:27:55,460
over to the video and hopefully we can

709
00:27:52,339 --> 00:27:57,199
get this going I can just click on this

710
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:59,029
so now you're there's a little bit of me

711
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:00,590
doing a little bit of intro to this but

712
00:27:59,029 --> 00:28:02,450
you'll see here from a few different

713
00:28:00,589 --> 00:28:03,439
farmers talking about adaptation and

714
00:28:02,450 --> 00:28:07,299
then we'll have some time for questions

715
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:07,299
it should take about 12 minutes

716
00:28:12,619 --> 00:28:17,179
the weather is definitely becoming more

717
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:18,769
erratic and more extreme than what I've

718
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:20,840
had been in the past I have that

719
00:28:18,769 --> 00:28:22,789
tendency as others do that have lived a

720
00:28:20,839 --> 00:28:24,379
long time in the same place to say well

721
00:28:22,789 --> 00:28:26,149
the winters aren't as cold we're not

722
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:29,390
getting as much snow certainly it's been

723
00:28:26,150 --> 00:28:31,610
a surprise over the last few years how

724
00:28:29,390 --> 00:28:33,980
much earlier the seasons have become in

725
00:28:31,609 --> 00:28:37,699
general and I would say that it actually

726
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:43,670
does seem like the season gets hotter

727
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:46,190
faster we're here at one of cornell's

728
00:28:43,670 --> 00:28:48,440
apple orchard research sites new york is

729
00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:50,269
well known for the quality of its apples

730
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:53,029
were usually second or third in the US

731
00:28:50,269 --> 00:28:55,250
and apple production and we got there by

732
00:28:53,029 --> 00:28:57,799
farmers from over many years really

733
00:28:55,250 --> 00:29:00,319
working with Cornell researchers to come

734
00:28:57,799 --> 00:29:01,730
up with best management practices but of

735
00:29:00,319 --> 00:29:03,409
course now we're facing like farmers

736
00:29:01,730 --> 00:29:05,000
everywhere new challenges challenges

737
00:29:03,410 --> 00:29:07,190
associated with climate change for

738
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:09,349
example I never expected when I got into

739
00:29:07,190 --> 00:29:12,320
this climate change research realm back

740
00:29:09,349 --> 00:29:14,149
in the 1990's that one of the most

741
00:29:12,319 --> 00:29:15,649
important things that would come up with

742
00:29:14,150 --> 00:29:18,290
regards to the fruit crop growers is

743
00:29:15,650 --> 00:29:20,390
actually cold and frost damage in a

744
00:29:18,289 --> 00:29:23,089
warming world the reason for that is

745
00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:25,070
that these plants can sometimes be

746
00:29:23,089 --> 00:29:27,019
tricked into blooming earlier with a

747
00:29:25,069 --> 00:29:28,369
warming winter and we had known from

748
00:29:27,019 --> 00:29:30,619
looking at historical records that the

749
00:29:28,369 --> 00:29:33,259
apples were blooming a few days earlier

750
00:29:30,619 --> 00:29:35,689
than they used to but in 2012 there was

751
00:29:33,259 --> 00:29:37,490
a real record breaker the apples in the

752
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:39,200
state bloom about four weeks earlier

753
00:29:37,490 --> 00:29:41,299
than normal never never observed before

754
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:43,429
and of course this put them into a

755
00:29:41,299 --> 00:29:46,549
really long period of frost risk and

756
00:29:43,429 --> 00:29:48,320
sure enough we lost close to half the

757
00:29:46,549 --> 00:29:51,440
crop in much of the state millions of

758
00:29:48,319 --> 00:29:52,669
dollars of damage so to deal with this

759
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:55,100
sort of thing we have to think about

760
00:29:52,670 --> 00:29:57,050
things like frost risk warning systems

761
00:29:55,099 --> 00:30:00,409
for farmers farmers may have to consider

762
00:29:57,049 --> 00:30:02,869
misting systems or wind machines for

763
00:30:00,410 --> 00:30:04,279
frost protection and our apple breeders

764
00:30:02,869 --> 00:30:07,099
may have to think about coming up with

765
00:30:04,279 --> 00:30:09,859
genetic types that don't jump the gun in

766
00:30:07,099 --> 00:30:11,569
terms of early bloom in warm winters so

767
00:30:09,859 --> 00:30:13,519
the experience of adapting to climate

768
00:30:11,569 --> 00:30:15,319
change may be different for each farm

769
00:30:13,519 --> 00:30:17,299
but nevertheless many of the state's

770
00:30:15,319 --> 00:30:19,909
leading agricultural industries which

771
00:30:17,299 --> 00:30:21,950
include dairy grapes apples and first

772
00:30:19,910 --> 00:30:24,679
market produce all face new challenges

773
00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:26,090
new risks and new opportunities when it

774
00:30:24,679 --> 00:30:28,309
comes to climate change in a depth

775
00:30:26,089 --> 00:30:32,569
asian farmers across New York all have a

776
00:30:28,308 --> 00:30:35,408
story to tell I'm Dale sign senior

777
00:30:32,569 --> 00:30:39,649
partner and Stein farms in Leroy we milk

778
00:30:35,409 --> 00:30:42,140
850 cows work almost 3,000 acres of land

779
00:30:39,650 --> 00:30:43,970
today we've had very heavy rain all

780
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:46,549
morning they got flood watches up all

781
00:30:43,970 --> 00:30:48,200
over we've seen years where a drought

782
00:30:46,548 --> 00:30:50,480
we're on the gravel ground you get

783
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:52,519
almost no yield we actually had two

784
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:55,190
years in a row two thousand eleven and

785
00:30:52,519 --> 00:30:57,798
two thousand twelve or to dry here so

786
00:30:55,190 --> 00:31:01,130
all our forages were lower production we

787
00:30:57,798 --> 00:31:03,379
feed 75 tonne of feet a day so about

788
00:31:01,130 --> 00:31:05,809
four tractor-trailer loads of the--

789
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:07,760
today we ended up by the end of 2012

790
00:31:05,808 --> 00:31:09,769
running out of our surplus forage we

791
00:31:07,759 --> 00:31:12,919
used all that up we end up on those

792
00:31:09,769 --> 00:31:15,200
years buying more grain which increases

793
00:31:12,919 --> 00:31:17,960
our pasta production and lowers to

794
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:22,370
profit down but we're harvesting 1500 to

795
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:24,528
2000 ton of triticale every May that if

796
00:31:22,369 --> 00:31:26,808
I didn't have that's extra on the same

797
00:31:24,528 --> 00:31:28,880
ground I didn't have that we would have

798
00:31:26,808 --> 00:31:31,519
been in a lot worse place than we were

799
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:33,110
without it the forage inventory

800
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:34,849
shortages that we've had from extreme

801
00:31:33,109 --> 00:31:36,469
weather conditions in recent years is I

802
00:31:34,849 --> 00:31:39,678
is really just the sign of things to

803
00:31:36,470 --> 00:31:41,960
come unfortunately farmers have to deal

804
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:44,840
with a change in climate each and every

805
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:46,519
day and so in extension we really try to

806
00:31:44,839 --> 00:31:48,619
help farmers manage their risk and

807
00:31:46,519 --> 00:31:50,750
growing a triticale forage crop or

808
00:31:48,619 --> 00:31:52,459
another small grain for forage can

809
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:54,798
really give another opportunity to

810
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:56,798
protect their resources over the winter

811
00:31:54,798 --> 00:32:00,589
because they're more vulnerable to

812
00:31:56,798 --> 00:32:02,658
extreme precipitation events and losing

813
00:32:00,589 --> 00:32:05,028
that soil we can protect the soil notice

814
00:32:02,659 --> 00:32:07,460
the fibrous root system this is why this

815
00:32:05,028 --> 00:32:09,798
crop can hold soils just see how much

816
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:12,110
soil even in this couple inches of roots

817
00:32:09,798 --> 00:32:14,720
that this is holding onto my standpoint

818
00:32:12,109 --> 00:32:18,740
from what I've seen on this farm

819
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:21,558
tradução works very well for us and the

820
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:24,859
palatability is phenomenal a cow's love

821
00:32:21,558 --> 00:32:26,359
it so this is an awesome combination of

822
00:32:24,859 --> 00:32:28,788
a profitable crop that protects the

823
00:32:26,359 --> 00:32:32,418
environment baffles me why more farmers

824
00:32:28,788 --> 00:32:34,538
aren't using Marchetta Cal just baffles

825
00:32:32,419 --> 00:32:34,538
me

826
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:42,950
I'm Paul King I do most of the vineyard

827
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:44,450
management and most of the winemaking

828
00:32:42,950 --> 00:32:46,100
and all of the distilling here at six

829
00:32:44,450 --> 00:32:49,730
mile creek vineyard and I've been here

830
00:32:46,099 --> 00:32:51,649
for almost 25 years if we talk about

831
00:32:49,730 --> 00:32:53,960
climate change longer growing season and

832
00:32:51,650 --> 00:32:55,880
a little hotter weather will ripen the

833
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:57,710
fruit more dependably there are some

834
00:32:55,880 --> 00:33:00,020
varieties and I give you two or three

835
00:32:57,710 --> 00:33:02,990
examples Pinot Noirs a little fussy

836
00:33:00,019 --> 00:33:05,569
Merlot for sure Cabernet Sauvignon and

837
00:33:02,990 --> 00:33:07,370
to a lesser degree Chardonnay I think

838
00:33:05,569 --> 00:33:10,429
these are varieties that will benefit

839
00:33:07,369 --> 00:33:12,589
the best management option for any

840
00:33:10,430 --> 00:33:14,509
individual vineyard to deal with

841
00:33:12,589 --> 00:33:16,369
increasingly varying weather if we talk

842
00:33:14,509 --> 00:33:18,049
about climate change would be to think

843
00:33:16,369 --> 00:33:19,789
carefully about the varieties that

844
00:33:18,049 --> 00:33:21,829
they're growing that's really the

845
00:33:19,789 --> 00:33:24,559
biggest management strategy because

846
00:33:21,829 --> 00:33:27,049
everything else you're doing is then a

847
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:29,539
little bit of sort of a stopgap wind

848
00:33:27,049 --> 00:33:33,159
turbines help in only very specific

849
00:33:29,539 --> 00:33:37,039
weather conditions we're very calm

850
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:38,990
conditions are set up and there's a deep

851
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:40,460
gradient between the temperatures at the

852
00:33:38,990 --> 00:33:43,880
surface in just a few hundred feet in

853
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:46,069
the air and mixing up that layer can

854
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:47,930
help a lot but they're pretty specific

855
00:33:46,069 --> 00:33:50,119
weather conditions and it's a pretty

856
00:33:47,930 --> 00:33:51,560
costly investment you need to grow the

857
00:33:50,119 --> 00:33:52,729
varieties that you can grow well and

858
00:33:51,559 --> 00:33:54,799
that's what you need to do that is

859
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:56,569
especially true at six mile creek but

860
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:59,059
it's also true for any of the other

861
00:33:56,569 --> 00:34:00,980
vineyards last winter was a particularly

862
00:33:59,059 --> 00:34:02,690
cold one and its really interesting i

863
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:05,779
think the minimum low temperature in

864
00:34:02,690 --> 00:34:07,700
ithaca is still probably minus 23

865
00:34:05,779 --> 00:34:10,668
degrees fahrenheit or so we didn't

866
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:13,519
really approach that but what we did see

867
00:34:10,668 --> 00:34:17,148
here were lots of excursions to minus

868
00:34:13,519 --> 00:34:19,820
14-15 minus 16 degrees and that is a

869
00:34:17,148 --> 00:34:20,960
very very critical temperature you're

870
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:23,330
going to get significant blood loss

871
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:26,269
right around that threshold what is that

872
00:34:23,329 --> 00:34:27,739
going to have on quality and quantity of

873
00:34:26,269 --> 00:34:30,079
wine grapes that are grown in the region

874
00:34:27,739 --> 00:34:33,500
and certainly at six mile creek vineyard

875
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:35,269
we have lost most of the reasoning the

876
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:38,000
proof that we had here as compared with

877
00:34:35,269 --> 00:34:41,469
our save all a hybrid where we have

878
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,469
virtually a full problem

879
00:34:47,070 --> 00:34:51,550
there is a lack of name recognition of

880
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:53,530
some of these hybrids save all Blanc

881
00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:55,180
that sounds a lot like Samuel block but

882
00:34:53,530 --> 00:34:57,250
but is it a seven young black and well

883
00:34:55,179 --> 00:34:59,169
it's it's not a seven young blonde it's

884
00:34:57,250 --> 00:35:01,719
a completely different variety it's my

885
00:34:59,170 --> 00:35:04,329
personal favorite I get six ton per acre

886
00:35:01,719 --> 00:35:05,949
even here it's disease resistant it's

887
00:35:04,329 --> 00:35:07,869
one of the first great varieties to

888
00:35:05,949 --> 00:35:10,149
ripen it's a beautiful grape variety

889
00:35:07,869 --> 00:35:12,039
it's just relatively unknown but I think

890
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:14,860
the people that I know that most enjoy

891
00:35:12,039 --> 00:35:18,789
wine really like trying new wines so

892
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:20,740
there's a huge huge outlet out there for

893
00:35:18,789 --> 00:35:22,750
exploring some of new hybrids they're

894
00:35:20,739 --> 00:35:24,969
great varieties it's one of the Finger

895
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:35,769
Lakes Forte's in the long run that's

896
00:35:24,969 --> 00:35:37,629
gonna serve to help us I'm rod Pharaoh

897

lamont fruit farm in water plot New York

899
00:35:40,139 --> 00:35:45,429
we operate about 500 acres of apples

900
00:35:43,179 --> 00:35:47,649
straw all kinds of rage about 29

901
00:35:45,429 --> 00:35:51,909
different ones the major varieties would

902
00:35:47,650 --> 00:35:54,610
be Empire honeycrisp gala Fugees sweet

903
00:35:51,909 --> 00:35:57,489
tangos we've certainly moved our bloom

904
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:59,320
time forward probably at least five to

905
00:35:57,489 --> 00:36:02,229
seven days and some years a lot more

906
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:03,910
than that how much of this we can

907
00:36:02,230 --> 00:36:06,460
attribute to climate change is still a

908
00:36:03,909 --> 00:36:08,289
little bit debatable to me personally

909
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:10,990
but there's certainly a sense that

910
00:36:08,289 --> 00:36:13,449
things are changing here and there that

911
00:36:10,989 --> 00:36:16,029
the climate is getting a little more

912
00:36:13,449 --> 00:36:19,449
unpredictable and the risk of early

913
00:36:16,030 --> 00:36:21,370
season and early bloom seems to be

914
00:36:19,449 --> 00:36:23,789
greater and greater every year the

915
00:36:21,369 --> 00:36:26,619
chances of a warm spell in March an

916
00:36:23,789 --> 00:36:28,449
extended warm spell seem to be much

917
00:36:26,619 --> 00:36:30,759
larger now than they were ten years ago

918
00:36:28,449 --> 00:36:32,409
I would say in general I farms

919
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:34,750
definitely vulnerable to extreme weather

920
00:36:32,409 --> 00:36:36,909
events it always has been we're at the

921
00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:39,610
mercy of Mother Nature no matter what we

922
00:36:36,909 --> 00:36:42,069
do the question is has the frequency

923
00:36:39,610 --> 00:36:44,500
increased and the risk certainly say

924
00:36:42,070 --> 00:36:46,930
they've been a lot of extreme instances

925
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:49,269
of weather over the last thirty plus

926
00:36:46,929 --> 00:36:50,980
years here we've had a number of very

927
00:36:49,269 --> 00:36:52,269
large hail storms but certainly the

928
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:57,369
frequency of that

929
00:36:52,269 --> 00:36:59,920
has been greater since 1998 one of the

930
00:36:57,369 --> 00:37:02,380
things that drives what you do in terms

931
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:05,230
of risk management is the profitability

932
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:06,940
of your business and a profitable

933
00:37:05,230 --> 00:37:09,460
business can afford to do things to

934
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:11,980
mitigate risk whether that be invest in

935
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:15,099
frost machines or try to choose better

936
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:17,070
orchard sites or add overhead cooling or

937
00:37:15,099 --> 00:37:20,170
overhead irrigation for us protection

938
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:22,480
through the 2000s the orchard business

939
00:37:20,170 --> 00:37:25,960
is generally been pretty healthy so I

940
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:27,969
certainly see an uptick in an investment

941
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:30,070
in risk management so anywhere we have

942
00:37:27,969 --> 00:37:32,529
reasonable sites or good orchard sites

943
00:37:30,070 --> 00:37:36,850
we've survived any frost that we've ever

944
00:37:32,530 --> 00:37:40,000
had including 2012 and we look at it as

945
00:37:36,849 --> 00:37:42,429
a company strategy that investing in the

946
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:46,570
highest possible fruit sites or orchard

947
00:37:42,429 --> 00:37:49,089
sites has just as bigger if not greater

948
00:37:46,570 --> 00:37:50,830
economic impact and then trying to

949
00:37:49,090 --> 00:37:54,010
mitigate a site that's going to be at

950
00:37:50,829 --> 00:37:56,289
risk in years when it's cold certainly

951
00:37:54,010 --> 00:38:00,060
multi parallel insurance can help in

952
00:37:56,289 --> 00:38:04,389
years of distinct disaster and actually

953
00:38:00,059 --> 00:38:06,759
make years that could be very very bad

954
00:38:04,389 --> 00:38:08,949
for you actually is that you could not

955
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:11,890
necessarily thrive in but you can at

956
00:38:08,949 --> 00:38:14,049
least survive through so we're big

957
00:38:11,889 --> 00:38:16,929
believers in that the strategies that

958
00:38:14,050 --> 00:38:19,780
are being used at the moment to lower

959
00:38:16,929 --> 00:38:22,029
your risk are definitely trying to try

960
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:24,430
to preserve the economic viability of

961
00:38:22,030 --> 00:38:26,650
fruit farms and businesses in general in

962
00:38:24,429 --> 00:38:29,349
western New York not all climate change

963
00:38:26,650 --> 00:38:32,050
is negative so increasing the number of

964
00:38:29,349 --> 00:38:34,679
heat units per season has a positive

965
00:38:32,050 --> 00:38:37,840
impact on what we can do for fruit size

966
00:38:34,679 --> 00:38:40,899
potential yield and return bloom tree

967
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:43,690
health so there's always gains and

968
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:45,309
balances with with anything We certainly

969
00:38:43,690 --> 00:38:47,829
have a little bit higher risk that we

970
00:38:45,309 --> 00:38:53,889
also possibly have a slightly higher

971
00:38:47,829 --> 00:38:55,539
potential in terms of yield and value my

972
00:38:53,889 --> 00:38:57,759
name is Jessica Clark I'm the assistant

973
00:38:55,539 --> 00:38:59,860
farm manager at the BBC farm project and

974
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:02,740
the poughkeepsie farm project is a

975
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:05,800
nonprofit that has an educational

976
00:39:02,739 --> 00:39:07,839
mission and also a working CSA for

977
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:10,210
we are not certified organic but we do

978
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:13,210
try to use organic practices notice

979
00:39:10,210 --> 00:39:15,159
climate change in terms of the disease

980
00:39:13,210 --> 00:39:17,320
susceptibility of our plants and I've

981
00:39:15,159 --> 00:39:21,129
seen definitely an increase in the

982
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:23,800
number of different diseases and pests

983
00:39:21,130 --> 00:39:26,619
that can affect us here in the Northeast

984
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:28,450
certainly when we have very extreme

985
00:39:26,619 --> 00:39:31,690
weather events and certainly when we

986
00:39:28,449 --> 00:39:34,029
have sort of these very strange you know

987
00:39:31,690 --> 00:39:37,119
very either early summers very late

988
00:39:34,030 --> 00:39:39,100
summers or very very late falls so that

989
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:41,230
it doesn't actually get to freezing

990
00:39:39,099 --> 00:39:43,809
until februari you know I'm sure that

991
00:39:41,230 --> 00:39:45,130
that extends how strong the disease

992
00:39:43,809 --> 00:39:47,230
pressure can be the next year and the

993
00:39:45,130 --> 00:39:49,360
pest pressure and heat stress actually

994
00:39:47,230 --> 00:39:50,920
can be a big factor for a lot of our

995
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:52,450
brassicas and in general that's

996
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:54,190
something you deal with as a farmer and

997
00:39:52,449 --> 00:39:55,689
the changing of the seasons spring to

998
00:39:54,190 --> 00:39:57,070
summer brassicas are always going to be

999
00:39:55,690 --> 00:39:59,110
a challenge but they're even more of a

1000
00:39:57,070 --> 00:40:02,320
challenge and they're a good indicator

1001
00:39:59,110 --> 00:40:04,780
in terms of crops because they do not

1002
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:06,130
like a lot of variability in there

1003
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:08,470
whether they pretty much like the

1004
00:40:06,130 --> 00:40:11,680
weather to always be you know relatively

1005
00:40:08,469 --> 00:40:13,029
mild not too wet not too dry and pretty

1006
00:40:11,679 --> 00:40:14,589
much the same temperature all the time

1007
00:40:13,030 --> 00:40:16,690
that's really just not what you get here

1008
00:40:14,590 --> 00:40:18,340
so we're already dealing with a change

1009
00:40:16,690 --> 00:40:21,220
in climate you know what was it two

1010
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:23,559
years ago when we would have 80 degree

1011
00:40:21,219 --> 00:40:26,019
weather and early March and then go

1012
00:40:23,559 --> 00:40:27,639
freezing in April crazy things can

1013
00:40:26,019 --> 00:40:30,219
happen is this season it's almost like

1014
00:40:27,639 --> 00:40:32,440
predicting for unpredictability having

1015
00:40:30,219 --> 00:40:34,809
that kind of reinforces the fact that we

1016
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:37,269
you know should have diversified market

1017
00:40:34,809 --> 00:40:39,099
areas and also diversified crops you

1018
00:40:37,269 --> 00:40:40,690
don't have to be as diversified as the

1019
00:40:39,099 --> 00:40:42,489
CSA because certainly that can be a

1020
00:40:40,690 --> 00:40:46,690
little bit overboard in some areas but

1021
00:40:42,489 --> 00:40:48,429
certainly to rely on one crop is you

1022
00:40:46,690 --> 00:40:50,170
know it's like playing a game of dice

1023
00:40:48,429 --> 00:40:52,509
like sometimes it's just not going to

1024
00:40:50,170 --> 00:40:54,430
come up your turn and if certainly if

1025
00:40:52,510 --> 00:40:55,840
you don't have crop insurance and even

1026
00:40:54,429 --> 00:40:58,359
if you do have crop insurance you know

1027
00:40:55,840 --> 00:41:01,660
it can be a very risky you know game to

1028
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:03,280
play I know people who are in the

1029
00:41:01,659 --> 00:41:05,589
orchard business and the in Ulster

1030
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:07,420
County and even their kind of going more

1031
00:41:05,590 --> 00:41:09,039
into agro-tourism they're going more

1032
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:11,289
into different crops different specialty

1033
00:41:09,039 --> 00:41:13,000
crops just to have something on the side

1034
00:41:11,289 --> 00:41:16,630
that they can rely on you know it kind

1035
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:19,639
of makes one as a farmer more bold to

1036
00:41:16,630 --> 00:41:21,320
say like oh well we'll just see how

1037
00:41:19,639 --> 00:41:24,049
early we can get tomatoes if it's going

1038
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:26,600
to be warmer earlier or we'll see how

1039
00:41:24,050 --> 00:41:28,070
late we can have crops you know into the

1040
00:41:26,599 --> 00:41:29,809
fall if it doesn't work it doesn't work

1041
00:41:28,070 --> 00:41:31,370
but you never know and probably

1042
00:41:29,809 --> 00:41:34,130
something else is going to fail in the

1043
00:41:31,369 --> 00:41:36,170
meantime I personally like to also make

1044
00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:38,090
sure that our organic matter is high in

1045
00:41:36,170 --> 00:41:40,130
our soils to begin with so that it has

1046
00:41:38,090 --> 00:41:42,620
that humise and organic matter that's

1047
00:41:40,130 --> 00:41:45,380
capable of holding water as well as as

1048
00:41:42,619 --> 00:41:48,889
much as possible keeping our soil

1049
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:50,150
covered in a cover crop when we can and

1050
00:41:48,889 --> 00:41:52,909
then even when we're telling in that

1051
00:41:50,150 --> 00:41:54,650
cover crop to try and choose moments

1052
00:41:52,909 --> 00:41:56,690
where we're not losing too much soil

1053
00:41:54,650 --> 00:41:59,360
certainly we're thinking about carbon

1054
00:41:56,690 --> 00:42:01,070
sequestration and being able to lock in

1055
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:02,930
a lot of that carbon into our soil is

1056
00:42:01,070 --> 00:42:04,309
partially because it's good for the

1057
00:42:02,929 --> 00:42:05,690
earth and partially because it's good

1058
00:42:04,309 --> 00:42:07,719
for our plants to have that much you

1059
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:10,880
know to have a high carbon soil you know

1060
00:42:07,719 --> 00:42:12,739
you come into the idea of sustainable

1061
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:15,230
farming knowing that you're trying to

1062
00:42:12,739 --> 00:42:17,989
not you know we're going the planet and

1063
00:42:15,230 --> 00:42:20,300
trying to you know make sure that you're

1064
00:42:17,989 --> 00:42:23,959
not um you know you're not messing

1065
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:25,490
things up to that well these are just

1066
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:27,349
some of the experiences and challenges

1067
00:42:25,489 --> 00:42:29,239
that farmers throughout the Northeast

1068
00:42:27,349 --> 00:42:31,610
are dealing with and adapting to climate

1069
00:42:29,239 --> 00:42:34,129
change but we have advantages in this

1070
00:42:31,610 --> 00:42:36,980
region to such as being relatively water

1071
00:42:34,130 --> 00:42:38,869
rich and with a longer growing season

1072
00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:41,510
this could open up new opportunities for

1073
00:42:38,869 --> 00:42:43,159
new markets and new crops here at

1074
00:42:41,510 --> 00:42:45,470
cornell and Cornell's Institute of

1075
00:42:43,159 --> 00:42:47,359
climate change in agriculture we are

1076
00:42:45,469 --> 00:42:48,739
poised and ready to take on climate

1077
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:50,750
change challenges and work with our

1078
00:42:48,739 --> 00:42:52,729
grower partners stay one step ahead of

1079
00:42:50,750 --> 00:42:56,380
the curve and take advantage of any

1080
00:42:52,730 --> 00:42:56,380
opportunities that might come our way

1081
00:43:07,639 --> 00:43:09,699
you

1082
00:43:11,568 --> 00:43:18,440
I thought I'm pretty soon the farmers be

1083
00:43:15,708 --> 00:43:21,108
able to do my whole talk and I won't

1084
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:26,028
even need me up here let me get rid of

1085
00:43:21,108 --> 00:43:34,998
this I want to hear it again so just

1086
00:43:26,028 --> 00:43:36,920
like to thank you for a great you

1087
00:43:34,998 --> 00:43:39,248
mentioned that we in the Northeast are

1088
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:40,969
relatively water-rich obviously

1089
00:43:39,248 --> 00:43:43,578
California is dealing with a very

1090
00:43:40,969 --> 00:43:46,818
different set of circumstances I'd read

1091
00:43:43,579 --> 00:43:48,940
a number of pieces about municipality in

1092
00:43:46,818 --> 00:43:52,000
California okay

1093
00:43:48,940 --> 00:43:53,710
to the ocean and sanitization projects

1094
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:56,230
do you think that that's going to get

1095
00:43:53,710 --> 00:44:00,909
viable option for agriculture going

1096
00:43:56,230 --> 00:44:03,280
forward in coastal states yeah so well I

1097
00:44:00,909 --> 00:44:04,449
big you know that these elements age I

1098
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:06,099
don't I don't follow that literature

1099
00:44:04,449 --> 00:44:08,710
really carefully only enough to know

1100
00:44:06,099 --> 00:44:09,980
that in place like Israel and listed and

1101
00:44:08,710 --> 00:44:13,639
working on that

1102
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:15,320
and that this going drought stress a lot

1103
00:44:13,639 --> 00:44:17,059
of parts of the world is increasing the

1104
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:19,580
pressure to move on that technology and

1105
00:44:17,059 --> 00:44:22,759
it's getting better getting more

1106
00:44:19,579 --> 00:44:26,179
feasible and whether it's you know on my

1107
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:28,220
my initial reaction is probably the

1108
00:44:26,179 --> 00:44:29,629
first place that kind of water will go

1109
00:44:28,219 --> 00:44:31,579
was from drinking water for humans

1110
00:44:29,630 --> 00:44:35,840
because the agriculture needs so much

1111
00:44:31,579 --> 00:44:37,159
water and that the cost is high but you

1112
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:38,960
know it is what we are using it for drip

1113
00:44:37,159 --> 00:44:41,118
irrigation reversible process we can

1114
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:43,579
minimize the amount of water

1115
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:47,088
so I think that's an area of Technology

1116
00:44:43,579 --> 00:44:48,528
that's moving forward whether it can you

1117
00:44:47,088 --> 00:44:50,719
know is one of these things like so many

1118
00:44:48,528 --> 00:44:52,219
things on my message can we keep pace

1119
00:44:50,719 --> 00:44:54,578
with the pace of climate change this

1120
00:44:52,219 --> 00:44:54,578
happen

1121
00:44:58,108 --> 00:45:03,028
I think if I tradition egghead San Diego

1122
00:45:01,108 --> 00:45:05,848
was involved in the desalination plants

1123
00:45:03,028 --> 00:45:08,940
costing 1 billion dollar provide seven

1124
00:45:05,849 --> 00:45:10,380
for some of the water thank you I'll

1125
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:13,980
hear that San Diego's investing point

1126
00:45:10,380 --> 00:45:15,960
Billy but that's kind of the points out

1127
00:45:13,980 --> 00:45:18,869
you know we're beginning to see the cost

1128
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:21,088
of adaptation which then puts into

1129
00:45:18,869 --> 00:45:23,110
context the cost of doing something to

1130
00:45:21,088 --> 00:45:26,119
mitigate

1131
00:45:23,110 --> 00:45:29,000
will be the cost to taxpayers be in

1132
00:45:26,119 --> 00:45:31,759
future as we continue to just cope with

1133
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:35,289
climate change as opposed to the you

1134
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:35,290
know suppose a tryst slowly

1135
00:45:38,108 --> 00:45:43,929
other questions

1136
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:46,730
can you think of any sort of specific

1137
00:45:43,929 --> 00:45:48,579
field levels adaptations that you've

1138
00:45:46,730 --> 00:45:50,750
seen people experimenting with not just

1139
00:45:48,579 --> 00:45:55,159
diversification but changes in the ways

1140
00:45:50,750 --> 00:45:59,030
that they manage their fields that may

1141
00:45:55,159 --> 00:46:02,629
be artists so well so well in you sorry

1142
00:45:59,030 --> 00:46:04,550
that they showed up in the video well in

1143
00:46:02,630 --> 00:46:06,079
terms of new ideas i don't know i mean i

1144
00:46:04,550 --> 00:46:08,600
had my here i think the things that we

1145
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:10,309
might list which is more attention more

1146
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:11,630
recognition that the whole soul club

1147
00:46:10,309 --> 00:46:13,909
thing we were talking about her some

1148
00:46:11,630 --> 00:46:14,430
time is also irrelevant to climate

1149
00:46:13,909 --> 00:46:16,858
change

1150
00:46:14,429 --> 00:46:19,649
in this thing about farmers kind of

1151
00:46:16,858 --> 00:46:21,539
tequila by surprises noticing farmers

1152
00:46:19,650 --> 00:46:26,250
investing in this big equipment to do

1153
00:46:21,539 --> 00:46:28,289
things more quickly on large acreages in

1154
00:46:26,250 --> 00:46:32,150
the gulf of windows extreme

1155
00:46:28,289 --> 00:46:32,150
yeah i totally think of anything

1156
00:46:33,460 --> 00:46:36,539
Allison ticketed you have something

1157
00:46:35,320 --> 00:46:38,910
perfect

1158
00:46:36,539 --> 00:46:40,679
farmers are constantly innovative in the

1159
00:46:38,909 --> 00:46:42,598
pokey like I said that big equipment

1160
00:46:40,679 --> 00:46:46,798
stuff is something they surprised me but

1161
00:46:42,599 --> 00:46:49,849
things we had we had one of our organic

1162
00:46:46,798 --> 00:46:52,889
farmer advisors from an old project who

1163
00:46:49,849 --> 00:46:56,068
started ridging his spring crops to keep

1164
00:46:52,889 --> 00:46:58,108
them out of the website its baby bears

1165
00:46:56,068 --> 00:47:00,478
are risen and then mulching it to try to

1166
00:46:58,108 --> 00:47:02,130
keep after the rain stopped to try to

1167
00:47:00,478 --> 00:47:04,018
keep the moisture and over the draw be

1168
00:47:02,130 --> 00:47:06,088
someone yeah so rigid will keep your

1169
00:47:04,018 --> 00:47:08,008
roots out of the wet soil and help the

1170
00:47:06,088 --> 00:47:11,778
trainers on the other hand then you do

1171
00:47:08,009 --> 00:47:15,079
need to if it gets dry about the dryer

1172
00:47:11,778 --> 00:47:15,079
that's an interesting

1173
00:47:15,369 --> 00:47:18,880
you're actually to the farmers but you

1174
00:47:17,199 --> 00:47:21,460
know we try to include a nap obviously a

1175
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:25,390
range of farmers some kind of Excalibur

1176
00:47:21,460 --> 00:47:29,409
shal to small-scale I can't tell you

1177
00:47:25,389 --> 00:47:33,129
over you know surprisingly realistic

1178
00:47:29,409 --> 00:47:36,190
optimist things are the majority of

1179
00:47:33,130 --> 00:47:39,249
farmers willing to change their practice

1180
00:47:36,190 --> 00:47:41,048
that even though they're not they don't

1181
00:47:39,248 --> 00:47:45,248
need to yet are they really talking

1182
00:47:41,048 --> 00:47:49,059
about in a way to prevent more carbon

1183
00:47:45,248 --> 00:47:50,819
emissions if they don't get any benefit

1184
00:47:49,059 --> 00:47:52,800
from

1185
00:47:50,820 --> 00:47:54,300
yeah of course is our farmers willing to

1186
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:55,550
change their practices if they don't get

1187
00:47:54,300 --> 00:48:00,060
in

1188
00:47:55,550 --> 00:48:02,820
my gut reaction is no they're all about

1189
00:48:00,059 --> 00:48:05,809
sending their kids to college you know

1190
00:48:02,820 --> 00:48:05,809
eating the families

1191
00:48:05,829 --> 00:48:12,309
they want to take a family vacation in

1192
00:48:07,449 --> 00:48:14,889
the summer so if it's going to affect

1193
00:48:12,309 --> 00:48:17,109
those things not likely to do it for go

1194
00:48:14,889 --> 00:48:19,098
to society they don't feel like they're

1195
00:48:17,108 --> 00:48:22,130
responsible for that

1196
00:48:19,099 --> 00:48:23,960
on the other hand you know I think you

1197
00:48:22,130 --> 00:48:26,210
know I have I didn't have my slide

1198
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:28,369
that's kind of climate change they're

1199
00:48:26,210 --> 00:48:29,599
just makes good business sense so as all

1200
00:48:28,369 --> 00:48:31,430
kinds of things about being one step

1201
00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:33,410
ahead of your competitors we've had

1202
00:48:31,429 --> 00:48:36,009
people even from like big international

1203
00:48:33,409 --> 00:48:39,409
companies like PepsiCo and Sarah and

1204
00:48:36,009 --> 00:48:41,210
these are you know liberals groups

1205
00:48:39,409 --> 00:48:43,429
coming to talk to us but they're all

1206
00:48:41,210 --> 00:48:46,099
about tell us what climate is convenient

1207
00:48:43,429 --> 00:48:47,989
parts the world where you stay one step

1208
00:48:46,099 --> 00:48:49,818
ahead of our competitors that's all we

1209
00:48:47,989 --> 00:48:52,670
need to do to be successful company then

1210
00:48:49,818 --> 00:48:55,099
time to change bring on what a day so

1211
00:48:52,670 --> 00:48:56,450
farmers are very it would take some

1212
00:48:55,099 --> 00:48:58,670
risks and be one step ahead of the

1213
00:48:56,449 --> 00:49:00,439
competition so far for example might

1214
00:48:58,670 --> 00:49:01,909
start investing thinking more about the

1215
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:03,769
self-help things been hearing about for

1216
00:49:01,909 --> 00:49:06,739
a long time when he hears the neighbors

1217
00:49:03,768 --> 00:49:08,058
say you know last year was super wet you

1218
00:49:06,739 --> 00:49:10,670
know you could get into your field but I

1219
00:49:08,059 --> 00:49:12,499
got into my feet the harvest so they

1220
00:49:10,670 --> 00:49:13,740
might start thinking about those kind of

1221
00:49:12,498 --> 00:49:18,679
things

1222
00:49:13,739 --> 00:49:23,539
they're not gonna go too far good cause

1223
00:49:18,679 --> 00:49:23,539
