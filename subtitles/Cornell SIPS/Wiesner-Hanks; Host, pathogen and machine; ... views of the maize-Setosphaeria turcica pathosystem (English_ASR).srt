1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:05,959
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,238 --> 00:00:07,849
University so as I think most of you

3
00:00:05,958 --> 00:00:10,339
know or now all of you definitely know

4
00:00:07,849 --> 00:00:11,599
I'm tier I'm in Rebecca's lab and today

5
00:00:10,339 --> 00:00:14,419
I'm going to be talking about basically

6
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:16,250
two very different views like a very

7
00:00:14,419 --> 00:00:18,079
micro and a very macro view of the same

8
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:21,339
path or system the main sinister

9
00:00:18,079 --> 00:00:24,108
psychopathy system disease pictured here

10
00:00:21,339 --> 00:00:27,309
so we've kind of introduced or really

11
00:00:24,109 --> 00:00:29,480
been focusing or thinking about this

12
00:00:27,309 --> 00:00:31,698
intellectual model like this so to speak

13
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:33,920
it's like paradigm of different scales

14
00:00:31,699 --> 00:00:35,660
of resistance in Rebecca's lab in the

15
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,070
past few years so kind of moving from

16
00:00:35,659 --> 00:00:38,119
the molecular scale resistance like

17
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:40,009
chemical warfare

18
00:00:38,119 --> 00:00:41,959
you know the interactions of different

19
00:00:40,009 --> 00:00:43,969
genes all the way up to you know

20
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:45,590
landscape resistance what genes are

21
00:00:43,969 --> 00:00:48,189
deployed where what's being grown where

22
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:51,380
what's the epidemiology of the pathogen

23
00:00:48,189 --> 00:00:53,570
and to look at each of these you know

24
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:56,000
you obviously need to construct a

25
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:57,890
different experiment to explore each of

26
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,689
these things at its own scale so you

27
00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:02,060
know that's what we've done in a

28
00:00:59,689 --> 00:01:03,379
molecular you know on the molecular side

29
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:05,090
of things that the molecular scope of

30
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:06,769
things you know use an rna-seq

31
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:09,320
experiment to see what genes what

32
00:01:06,769 --> 00:01:12,170
pathways what molecular mechanisms are

33
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:13,849
important at a given time on the tissue

34
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:15,609
side of things you know the path the the

35
00:01:13,849 --> 00:01:17,750
pathogen is moving through a

36
00:01:15,609 --> 00:01:20,450
three-dimensional leaf you know it's

37
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:22,609
it's not homogeneous so we've been doing

38
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:26,270
histopathology experiments to study that

39
00:01:22,609 --> 00:01:28,760
on the plot level you know gene mapping

40
00:01:26,269 --> 00:01:31,250
look at looking at resistance in the

41
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:34,100
field you know on a rotary basis looking

42
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:35,989
at natural diversity etc and on the

43
00:01:34,099 --> 00:01:37,669
landscape level now you know just in the

44
00:01:35,989 --> 00:01:42,859
past two years moving to aerial

45
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:44,390
photography drones and so you know like

46
00:01:42,859 --> 00:01:47,599
Rebecca said I've been involved in a lot

47
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:49,400
of different things you know growth

48
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:51,799
chamber experiments are in a seek

49
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:53,630
experiment system pathology things often

50
00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:56,420
kind of like jumping in on different

51
00:01:53,629 --> 00:01:59,239
projects maze transposon mutagenesis was

52
00:01:56,420 --> 00:02:00,890
one of my main projects gene mapping I

53
00:01:59,239 --> 00:02:03,259
think but phenotyping writing a couple

54
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:05,299
reviews at the Bekaa but I'm gonna

55
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:06,650
basically focus on two main things you

56
00:02:05,299 --> 00:02:09,560
know dividing it up into this micro and

57
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:11,360
macro view micro being an RNA seek

58
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:13,580
experiment using our gene isolines that

59
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,470
were wrapping up the paper now for

60
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:17,180
and on the macroscale what's been

61
00:02:15,469 --> 00:02:19,129
funding me for the past two years which

62
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:21,920
is genomics or high-throughput

63
00:02:19,129 --> 00:02:25,759
genotyping project about aerial imaging

64
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:27,169
of northern leaf blight so some

65
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:29,539
background if you've heard me talk

66
00:02:27,169 --> 00:02:30,769
basically ever in the past five years or

67
00:02:29,539 --> 00:02:32,539
if you've been in a cornfield you're

68
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:35,480
familiar with northern leaf blight it's

69
00:02:32,539 --> 00:02:38,120
a fungal disease the foliar disease

70
00:02:35,479 --> 00:02:41,060
it occurs in cool wet areas like Central

71
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:42,800
New York State it causes these nasty

72
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:43,969
necrotic lesions that you can see here

73
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,980
and as you might imagine that's gonna

74
00:02:43,969 --> 00:02:47,810
lead to lower yield and also lower

75
00:02:45,979 --> 00:02:50,840
silage quality so fewer available

76
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:53,719
nutrients certainly in terms of

77
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:55,700
quantifying its effect about and will be

78
00:02:53,719 --> 00:02:57,259
specifically there's been I don't know

79
00:02:55,699 --> 00:02:59,089
new interest or resurgence of interest

80
00:02:57,259 --> 00:03:00,949
in the past few years because it's been

81
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:04,640
becoming a more serious problem

82
00:03:00,949 --> 00:03:08,149
so some estimates of you know estimated

83
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:10,609
yield loss from 2016 for the years prior

84
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:12,439
you know the best estimate of this team

85
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:14,480
of plant pathologists was that in 2015

86
00:03:12,439 --> 00:03:17,139
an Obie was accounting for about 25% of

87
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:21,139
all Mays disease yield loss incurring

88
00:03:17,139 --> 00:03:24,079
penalty or economic loss of about two

89
00:03:21,139 --> 00:03:25,879
billion dollars but it always looks more

90
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,680
dramatic and striking when you see it at

91
00:03:25,879 --> 00:03:30,139
actions this is a photo taken by a

92
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,909
longtime lab manager to a coal bin not

93
00:03:30,139 --> 00:03:33,049
far from here and what you can see is

94
00:03:31,909 --> 00:03:34,939
that you know when you have the right

95
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:37,550
weather conditions which we often do in

96
00:03:34,939 --> 00:03:39,409
central New York when you had the

97
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:41,660
pathogen population there when you have

98
00:03:39,409 --> 00:03:43,219
a non resistant or susceptible variety

99
00:03:41,659 --> 00:03:46,370
you know you can get these devastating

100
00:03:43,219 --> 00:03:49,580
outbreaks the causal agent is this

101
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:51,289
fungus set us free at turcica and the

102
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:54,530
really critical things I think first and

103
00:03:51,289 --> 00:03:56,810
foremost about its biology are one it's

104
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:58,610
heavy by a trophic that is it starts as

105
00:03:56,810 --> 00:03:59,090
a bio troph feeding off living maize

106
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:00,380
cells

107
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:02,360
feeding off living tissue and

108
00:04:00,379 --> 00:04:04,310
essentially trying to avoid detection or

109
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:05,690
avoiding detection then it switches into

110
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:07,849
a necro trophic phase in which it's

111
00:04:05,689 --> 00:04:09,709
killing off the host tissue and living

112
00:04:07,849 --> 00:04:11,209
off that dead tissue and that's the

113
00:04:09,709 --> 00:04:14,330
necrotic lesions that you saw you know

114
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:16,819
before it's also haploid like most fungi

115
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:18,709
and it mostly so it can undergo sexual

116
00:04:16,819 --> 00:04:20,750
reproduction meiosis but mostly it's

117
00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:23,149
asexual reproduction so these are the

118
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:24,800
asexual spores that's the vast source of

119
00:04:23,149 --> 00:04:27,349
you know inoculum in the disease

120
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,879
pressure and that's how you get

121
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:32,420
he's like lineages that cover a large

122
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:34,189
area so what does pathogenesis look like

123
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:37,340
this is a freeze-frame from a video that

124
00:04:34,189 --> 00:04:38,300
I'll play in just a second but this is

125
00:04:37,339 --> 00:04:39,769
from one of the histopathology

126
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:42,800
experiments I was running in the growth

127
00:04:39,769 --> 00:04:47,060
chamber so the orange is the maize leaf

128
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:48,650
the green is the fungal tissue and what

129
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:50,360
you can see is there's a Canadian so

130
00:04:48,649 --> 00:04:51,560
there's the asexuals forest thousands or

131
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:53,210
tens of thousands of them laying down

132
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:55,399
the leaf germinate I try to penetrate

133
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:58,099
the leaf it grows through the meze of

134
00:04:55,399 --> 00:04:59,419
fill and then after I don't between 1

135
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:01,820
and 3 weeks depending on where you are

136
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:03,500
and the resistance etc etc it's gonna

137
00:05:01,819 --> 00:05:04,730
reach the xylem and then it colonizes

138
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:06,230
xylem very rapidly

139
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:08,000
you know it's moving along the xylem it

140
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:10,400
can branch out of it that's why you get

141
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:14,209
those you know long skinny lesions it's

142
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:16,370
moving along the vascular tissue so

143
00:05:14,209 --> 00:05:17,959
here's a video both that shows it in a

144
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:22,850
little bit clearer detail and also it's

145
00:05:17,959 --> 00:05:24,289
just very neat this is a single spore or

146
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:26,750
you know looking at an extremely fine

147
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:30,530
detail and once you see this so this is

148
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:31,759
you know probably on this tissue you

149
00:05:30,529 --> 00:05:34,339
would not be able to see any sort of

150
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:35,719
lesion you know just with your eye but

151
00:05:34,339 --> 00:05:37,429
eventually what's gonna happen is that

152
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:39,410
it'll keep going throughout this

153
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:42,829
vascular bundle or like keep going

154
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:44,930
throughout that xylem expand branch out

155
00:05:42,829 --> 00:05:46,250
into other vascular bundle and other

156
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:48,680
parts of vascular tissue and eventually

157
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:54,259
clog it essentially and start killing

158
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:56,660
off the host tissue so what do we know

159
00:05:54,259 --> 00:05:58,909
about and I'll be a resistance well a

160
00:05:56,660 --> 00:06:00,110
lot but quickly summarizing it so you

161
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:01,939
know this is kind of dichotomy of

162
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:04,040
qualitative and quantitative resistance

163
00:06:01,939 --> 00:06:06,560
I'm gonna start with qualitative so like

164
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:08,600
RG mediated resistance there are four

165
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:11,149
canonical so to speak long known are

166
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:13,310
genes the HT genes in this pappa system

167
00:06:11,149 --> 00:06:15,729
HT is short for helmet this for iam

168
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:18,949
turcica an outdated name for the fungus

169
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:21,020
and kind of like with the standard gene

170
00:06:18,949 --> 00:06:22,310
for gene model you know as expected

171
00:06:21,019 --> 00:06:24,409
you've got this gene for gene

172
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:27,680
interaction with AV rh t jeans a

173
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:30,410
virulence h t genes in the fungus series

174
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:32,420
what it looks like these are from pics

175
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:34,280
of greenhouse experiments by former grad

176
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:36,710
student Rebecca's challenge young you

177
00:06:34,279 --> 00:06:37,819
know here's a it without an R gene here

178
00:06:36,709 --> 00:06:40,769
is it with one of two different our

179
00:06:37,819 --> 00:06:42,149
genes or the interesting things

180
00:06:40,769 --> 00:06:43,829
about just even with only these four

181
00:06:42,149 --> 00:06:46,529
genes is that you know we have different

182
00:06:43,829 --> 00:06:48,120
effects if not all of these even on the

183
00:06:46,529 --> 00:06:49,679
like level that's visible to your eye

184
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:52,889
are affecting the pathogen in a

185
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:54,780
different in the same way so HD to that

186
00:06:52,889 --> 00:06:56,310
you can see here doesn't delay the

187
00:06:54,779 --> 00:06:58,439
formation of lesions they still show up

188
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:59,939
around ten days afterwards but it does

189
00:06:58,439 --> 00:07:02,519
so their growth and you get lots of this

190
00:06:59,939 --> 00:07:05,668
chlorotic yellowing babies think it's

191
00:07:02,519 --> 00:07:07,469
clear on the TV and HTN you know

192
00:07:05,668 --> 00:07:11,279
pictured here on the right it does not

193
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:12,750
so the the rate of growth of the lesions

194
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:14,668
but it does greatly delay their

195
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:16,139
formation so it's good you know acting

196
00:07:14,668 --> 00:07:19,288
at different points resistance is not

197
00:07:16,139 --> 00:07:21,750
all the same and one of the interesting

198
00:07:19,288 --> 00:07:23,310
things is that so far it so not many of

199
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:25,918
these genes are actually confirmed known

200
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:28,110
or cloned but of the two that are there

201
00:07:25,918 --> 00:07:30,930
basically they're not the standard sort

202
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:32,968
of our gene and AVR gene so the our gene

203
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:36,930
that is cloned is HTM which is a wall

204
00:07:32,968 --> 00:07:39,569
associated kinase and you know this is

205
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:42,228
not most our genes and the kind of

206
00:07:39,569 --> 00:07:47,430
canonical model or the typical our gene

207
00:07:42,228 --> 00:07:49,110
you know is a cytosolic gene is a

208
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:51,689
cytosol chain with a nucleotide binding

209
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:53,189
and loosing rich repeat domain and HTN

210
00:07:51,689 --> 00:07:55,379
is not this it's kind of part of the

211
00:07:53,189 --> 00:07:56,939
smaller category like 1/4 to 1/3 of

212
00:07:55,379 --> 00:07:59,459
known are genes that are not really

213
00:07:56,939 --> 00:08:02,009
fitting in that mold AVR ht1

214
00:07:59,459 --> 00:08:04,769
in the fungus which go in terrence group

215
00:08:02,009 --> 00:08:06,449
has been working on you know most fungal

216
00:08:04,769 --> 00:08:08,250
effector genes are small secreted

217
00:08:06,449 --> 00:08:09,840
proteins so they're about 20 amino acids

218
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:12,418
the fungus secretes them and they

219
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:14,579
interfere with the host defenses AVR ht1

220
00:08:12,418 --> 00:08:16,560
is not that rather it's a secondary

221
00:08:14,579 --> 00:08:17,879
metabolite gene that has both polyketide

222
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,699
synthase and non-ribosomal peptide

223
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:22,769
synthase domains so it's making its you

224
00:08:20,699 --> 00:08:24,658
know it is a protein which is assembling

225
00:08:22,769 --> 00:08:28,649
other very very small proteins same

226
00:08:24,658 --> 00:08:30,629
dorky tides you know obviously or our

227
00:08:28,649 --> 00:08:32,610
genes is not the entirety of what we

228
00:08:30,629 --> 00:08:34,349
know about resistance so in terms of

229
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:37,320
quantitative resistance you know i'm

230
00:08:34,349 --> 00:08:38,849
dividing these up but you know it is a

231
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:40,500
spectrum and i think everybody kind of

232
00:08:38,849 --> 00:08:41,789
operates with this idea that you know

233
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,979
both there are these two kinds but there

234
00:08:41,788 --> 00:08:45,149
is a spectrum obviously between

235
00:08:42,979 --> 00:08:47,220
quantitative and qualitative resistance

236
00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:48,778
but in terms of quantitative you know

237
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:50,399
there's lots of qtls there's lots of

238
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:54,500
diversity for resistance so this is an

239
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:57,710
image i really like from jesse poland's

240
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:59,899
paper on NLB resistance in the maze nan

241
00:08:57,710 --> 00:09:01,910
population and you can just see you know

242
00:08:59,899 --> 00:09:02,990
this is what the range of natural

243
00:09:01,909 --> 00:09:05,629
diversity in terms

244
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:08,659
NOP resistance looks like Randy why sir

245
00:09:05,629 --> 00:09:10,580
one of Rebecca's old students or former

246
00:09:08,659 --> 00:09:11,750
students you know did a meta-analysis

247
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:13,970
just from a few different mapping

248
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:15,379
studies and you know the NLB qto from I

249
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:18,200
think five mapping studies called it

250
00:09:15,379 --> 00:09:20,059
covered 40% of the genetic map Jesse

251
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:21,890
found 29 qto and you can see from down

252
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:24,519
here you know most of the QTL are

253
00:09:21,889 --> 00:09:26,870
present across or at least the low sigh

254
00:09:24,519 --> 00:09:30,019
heavily across most of the germ plasm

255
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:31,759
and again I won't cover this but I think

256
00:09:30,019 --> 00:09:32,899
it's an interesting parallel kind of to

257
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:35,980
what we see with the our genes

258
00:09:32,899 --> 00:09:37,250
specifically h t2 and HT n is that

259
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:38,899
challenge

260
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:40,279
chung another former grad student of

261
00:09:38,899 --> 00:09:43,610
Rebekah's did this really interesting

262
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:45,409
work about QTL isolines so qto also can

263
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:47,450
have different effects so she's working

264
00:09:45,409 --> 00:09:49,909
with these two QTL isolated from the

265
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:51,790
resistant line text me oh three now both

266
00:09:49,909 --> 00:09:54,230
on chromosome one that fairly far apart

267
00:09:51,789 --> 00:09:55,939
and one of them basically may believe

268
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:57,649
harder to penetrate so fewer conditio

269
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:59,330
could penetrate but it didn't slow their

270
00:09:57,649 --> 00:10:00,769
growth one of them slowed the growth

271
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:02,330
post penetration but didn't

272
00:10:00,769 --> 00:10:04,429
significantly reduce their ability to

273
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:05,750
penetrate beliefs so again we already

274
00:10:04,429 --> 00:10:07,459
are going into this with this idea of

275
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:09,830
like uh you know they're operating at

276
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:13,879
different points spatially temporally

277
00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:14,870
chemically etc so moving on to what I've

278
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:18,139
been working on

279
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:22,009
again the micro scale is mostly going to

280
00:10:18,139 --> 00:10:23,330
be about this rna-seq experiment and the

281
00:10:22,009 --> 00:10:24,769
experimental design of this basically

282
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:26,360
has two parts because we're interested

283
00:10:24,769 --> 00:10:27,889
in looking at multiple things so the

284
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:31,370
first part is the host and pathogen

285
00:10:27,889 --> 00:10:33,319
combinations so we are inoculating one

286
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:36,679
of two maze hosts which does or does not

287
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:39,800
have amazed our gene ht2 with one of two

288
00:10:36,679 --> 00:10:41,809
pathogen isolates which do have their

289
00:10:39,799 --> 00:10:43,639
own genetic differences but the critical

290
00:10:41,809 --> 00:10:46,669
one is that they either have the wild

291
00:10:43,639 --> 00:10:49,009
type capital letters a virulence gene or

292
00:10:46,669 --> 00:10:52,459
the non wild-type you know little

293
00:10:49,009 --> 00:10:54,740
letters a virulence gene and so what

294
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:56,050
that means in terms of our gene and AVR

295
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:59,210
genes so this is kind of the classic

296
00:10:56,049 --> 00:11:01,899
gene for gene model of our genes is that

297
00:10:59,210 --> 00:11:05,990
if you have the our gene and the

298
00:11:01,899 --> 00:11:08,328
pathogen has a cognate Wow type AVR gene

299
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:10,428
you know we say Wow recognizable AVR

300
00:11:08,328 --> 00:11:12,019
a virulence gene you induced this

301
00:11:10,428 --> 00:11:13,999
resistance reaction like the one we sell

302
00:11:12,019 --> 00:11:16,009
few sides before you were you induced

303
00:11:13,999 --> 00:11:18,769
that chlorosis and that restrictive

304
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:20,269
nation growth if you know the host is

305
00:11:18,769 --> 00:11:21,589
missing the our gene obviously it's

306
00:11:20,269 --> 00:11:23,989
gonna be susceptible whereas

307
00:11:21,589 --> 00:11:27,379
susceptibility background line is or if

308
00:11:23,989 --> 00:11:29,899
the pathogen has the non recognizable

309
00:11:27,379 --> 00:11:32,959
form of this AVR locus it's going to be

310
00:11:29,899 --> 00:11:34,759
a susceptible interaction the second

311
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:36,138
component of it is that we also want to

312
00:11:34,759 --> 00:11:37,519
know about this bio trophy necro trophy

313
00:11:36,139 --> 00:11:39,739
transition because how many by atrocious

314
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:41,239
are there are really interesting model

315
00:11:39,739 --> 00:11:43,009
because you can compare them both the

316
00:11:41,239 --> 00:11:44,480
bio trophy fungi and to necro trophic

317
00:11:43,009 --> 00:11:45,889
fungi and there's hemi bio trophy that

318
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:47,329
works differently among you know

319
00:11:45,889 --> 00:11:49,818
different clades of organisms and

320
00:11:47,328 --> 00:11:52,128
pathogens so in here what we're doing

321
00:11:49,818 --> 00:11:53,808
you know the bio trophy necro trophy

322
00:11:52,129 --> 00:11:55,999
transition and most germplasm in a

323
00:11:53,808 --> 00:11:57,618
growth chamber happens typically before

324
00:11:55,999 --> 00:12:00,678
10 days usually around eight or nine

325
00:11:57,619 --> 00:12:03,019
days after you ovulate so we sampled at

326
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:05,688
four different time points days post

327
00:12:03,019 --> 00:12:07,459
inoculation three five seven and ten and

328
00:12:05,688 --> 00:12:09,318
so we've got three time points within

329
00:12:07,458 --> 00:12:11,328
the by trophic phase and then ten ten

330
00:12:09,318 --> 00:12:12,828
points in the negative phase and then

331
00:12:11,328 --> 00:12:15,828
there's appropriate negative control so

332
00:12:12,828 --> 00:12:17,838
you know knock inoculated maze plants on

333
00:12:15,828 --> 00:12:19,609
the host side and the pathogen side we

334
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:23,360
have just pathogen isolettes growing in

335
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:24,889
a you know petri dish and culture and we

336
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:27,289
have a lot of questions that we have

337
00:12:24,889 --> 00:12:28,489
asked and answered and you know but i

338
00:12:27,289 --> 00:12:30,678
think are really fascinating but I'm

339
00:12:28,489 --> 00:12:32,629
really gonna focus on a small set of

340
00:12:30,678 --> 00:12:34,149
them under kind of two umbrellas the

341
00:12:32,629 --> 00:12:36,739
first being exploratory questions

342
00:12:34,149 --> 00:12:39,558
obviously like an RNA seek data set or

343
00:12:36,739 --> 00:12:41,119
Eddie you know large-scale data set has

344
00:12:39,558 --> 00:12:43,129
a lot of exploratory questions to ask

345
00:12:41,119 --> 00:12:45,499
the ones that you know I think are

346
00:12:43,129 --> 00:12:46,699
really fascinating for this are what

347
00:12:45,499 --> 00:12:48,619
does the bio trophy necro trophy

348
00:12:46,698 --> 00:12:50,238
transition look like in both the host in

349
00:12:48,619 --> 00:12:52,459
the pathogen what is the difference

350
00:12:50,239 --> 00:12:54,860
between a resistant and susceptible

351
00:12:52,458 --> 00:12:59,268
interaction and then you know we have

352
00:12:54,860 --> 00:13:02,178
ht2 mapped we have AVR h2 to mat you

353
00:12:59,269 --> 00:13:04,188
know somewhere in our transcript reads

354
00:13:02,178 --> 00:13:07,159
are the genes we're looking for can we

355
00:13:04,188 --> 00:13:10,308
use like wise things like wise criteria

356
00:13:07,159 --> 00:13:14,808
to narrow down our very long candidate

357
00:13:10,308 --> 00:13:15,980
list and so keeping this experiment

358
00:13:14,808 --> 00:13:18,110
straight I think this is the most

359
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:20,298
helpful plot what we have is on the

360
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:22,159
x-axis the days post inoculation each

361
00:13:20,298 --> 00:13:24,588
line is a host path

362
00:13:22,159 --> 00:13:25,909
combination and y-axis is basically what

363
00:13:24,589 --> 00:13:27,740
percentage of the reads allowing to have

364
00:13:25,909 --> 00:13:30,019
fungus you know essentially fungal

365
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:33,709
biomass by percentage of the samples

366
00:13:30,019 --> 00:13:34,879
were taking from those leaves and the

367
00:13:33,708 --> 00:13:36,649
first thing to point out is that you

368
00:13:34,879 --> 00:13:37,730
know between seven and ten days what

369
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:39,198
does the bio trophy Nicko trophy

370
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:41,420
transition look like among other things

371
00:13:39,198 --> 00:13:43,128
it's a rapid increase in fungal biomass

372
00:13:41,419 --> 00:13:46,849
this is really when it takes off once it

373
00:13:43,129 --> 00:13:48,528
hits that and I won't show the pca is

374
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:50,509
but essentially from three five and

375
00:13:48,528 --> 00:13:52,458
seven days doing this by atrophic phase

376
00:13:50,509 --> 00:13:53,930
the pathogens gene expression is the

377
00:13:52,458 --> 00:13:56,028
same at all those time points it's just

378
00:13:53,929 --> 00:13:57,649
reaching for the xylem not much is

379
00:13:56,028 --> 00:14:01,159
changing that we can detect quite

380
00:13:57,649 --> 00:14:02,958
similar second one is that you know this

381
00:14:01,159 --> 00:14:05,328
is what an RG mediated resistance looks

382
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:07,518
like hd2 is inhibiting the growth of new

383
00:14:05,328 --> 00:14:10,278
york one because new york one has the

384
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:11,810
recognizable form of the AVR ht2 locust

385
00:14:10,278 --> 00:14:16,399
you know what we think of as the

386
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:18,649
wild-type the third point is that ht2

387
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:20,600
does not have an effect on the

388
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:21,500
twenty-eighth a isolate which is you

389
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:23,420
know this is a nice look which is

390
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:25,100
carrying the non recognizable form or

391
00:14:23,419 --> 00:14:26,299
you know it's either mutated and missing

392
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:29,120
or something or there's somehow

393
00:14:26,299 --> 00:14:32,328
different you know it does not have an

394
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:35,389
effect on the growth and the fourth one

395
00:14:32,328 --> 00:14:37,039
I don't touch on this I won't touch on

396
00:14:35,389 --> 00:14:39,259
this in the discussion but it's a really

397
00:14:37,039 --> 00:14:40,759
fascinating point is that 28a is

398
00:14:39,259 --> 00:14:42,818
essentially a better pathogen it's more

399
00:14:40,759 --> 00:14:45,230
vigorous and we've always noticed this

400
00:14:42,818 --> 00:14:46,578
you know anecdotally anyone who's worked

401
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:48,139
with these two isolates has seemed like

402
00:14:46,578 --> 00:14:49,309
okay this one's great that one doesn't

403
00:14:48,139 --> 00:14:51,680
grow super well it doesn't in check

404
00:14:49,309 --> 00:14:53,539
super well and so we are also able and

405
00:14:51,679 --> 00:14:55,008
won't let go into this at all but we are

406
00:14:53,539 --> 00:14:57,318
also able to say okay what's the

407
00:14:55,009 --> 00:14:58,639
difference between when you have no are

408
00:14:57,318 --> 00:15:00,889
gene that is they're both susceptible

409
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:02,629
interactions what do a weak and a strong

410
00:15:00,889 --> 00:15:04,220
pathogen look like and what is a host

411
00:15:02,629 --> 00:15:06,169
responding to a weak and a strong

412
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:07,939
pathogen look like and how are they

413
00:15:06,169 --> 00:15:10,578
different because these isolates that'll

414
00:15:07,938 --> 00:15:12,198
in a lot of genes and will like a lot of

415
00:15:10,578 --> 00:15:16,938
portions of the genome are 100%

416
00:15:12,198 --> 00:15:19,039
identical so one thing people like to

417
00:15:16,938 --> 00:15:21,919
ask when they do a paired RNA seek

418
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:24,649
experiment you know the common thing is

419
00:15:21,919 --> 00:15:27,679
to say okay when I infect its host with

420
00:15:24,649 --> 00:15:29,509
an OB or when I spray an OB on to this

421
00:15:27,679 --> 00:15:30,469
host you know looking at both genomes

422
00:15:29,509 --> 00:15:32,750
both transcriptomes

423
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:34,699
what do the genes do do they go up or

424
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:36,350
down and then you know characterize that

425
00:15:34,698 --> 00:15:38,299
and some sort of

426
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:40,519
so we've worked pretty hard to basically

427
00:15:38,299 --> 00:15:43,789
you know change this from a list of

428
00:15:40,519 --> 00:15:45,710
200,000 p-values into something you know

429
00:15:43,789 --> 00:15:47,599
tangible or understandable that we can

430
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:51,350
put in sort of literature form you know

431
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:52,940
prose as it were and so what we found

432
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:55,100
basically was the most useful the most

433
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:56,900
informative was using p fam domains so

434
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:59,450
what sort of proteins are they predicted

435
00:15:56,899 --> 00:16:00,799
to be in the hosting pathogen and then

436
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:02,240
you know we can separate them out and

437
00:16:00,799 --> 00:16:03,979
kind of parse and break this down into

438
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:05,990
you know an understanding of it

439
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:08,690
biologically by separating out by time

440
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:11,419
by hosting by pathogen and I'm just

441
00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:13,370
gonna focus here on maze domains

442
00:16:11,419 --> 00:16:14,659
breaking down kind of the bio trophy and

443
00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:16,279
neckerchief you don't Mane's but I think

444
00:16:14,659 --> 00:16:20,899
tell a really interesting story about

445
00:16:16,279 --> 00:16:22,879
what Hemi bio trophy looks like so what

446
00:16:20,899 --> 00:16:26,269
this figure is is a subsection of a

447
00:16:22,879 --> 00:16:27,769
figure from the paper on each row are

448
00:16:26,269 --> 00:16:28,970
the different pfam terms and I'll go

449
00:16:27,769 --> 00:16:31,100
through them and get what the

450
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:33,649
significance is on the columns are the

451
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:35,540
time points 3 5 7 and 10 and then each

452
00:16:33,649 --> 00:16:37,399
of those four squares is basically our

453
00:16:35,539 --> 00:16:39,860
four combinations of hosts and pathogen

454
00:16:37,399 --> 00:16:43,789
took a lot of finagling ticket a lot of

455
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:46,009
stuff on to this figure but um so some

456
00:16:43,789 --> 00:16:47,569
things that we've found we would have

457
00:16:46,009 --> 00:16:50,569
been more surprised if they hadn't shown

458
00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:52,280
up so during these are key fam domains

459
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:54,920
which are enriched among the maze genes

460
00:16:52,279 --> 00:16:58,399
upregulated during by a trophy no three

461
00:16:54,919 --> 00:17:00,889
five seven days predominantly so the

462
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:02,870
first is you know new scene repeats and

463
00:17:00,889 --> 00:17:04,819
nucleotide binding domains and in this

464
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:06,799
paper system as well wall associated

465
00:17:04,819 --> 00:17:08,809
kinase is you know those are the

466
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:10,789
classical form of genes which detect

467
00:17:08,809 --> 00:17:13,129
fungal effectors and/or pathogen

468
00:17:10,789 --> 00:17:14,509
associated molecular patterns again

469
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:16,010
that's something that's totally not

470
00:17:14,509 --> 00:17:18,559
surprising to see and we see it again

471
00:17:16,009 --> 00:17:20,450
what we know of especially about NBL or

472
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:22,720
our gene regulation is that you know

473
00:17:20,450 --> 00:17:25,309
once the plant detects that there is a

474
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:27,559
microbe you know attempting to infect

475
00:17:25,309 --> 00:17:31,250
the leaf it up regulates like all of

476
00:17:27,559 --> 00:17:33,049
these genes other things basically are

477
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:34,789
attested to in the literature for other

478
00:17:33,049 --> 00:17:35,930
diseases but they're kind of this is the

479
00:17:34,789 --> 00:17:38,750
first time that they're popping up on

480
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:40,250
our radar selectins or you know an anti

481
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:41,809
microbial protein that's been studying a

482
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:43,730
lot of other pasture systems but we've

483
00:17:41,809 --> 00:17:47,539
never looked at them but kind of raises

484
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:48,799
a new hypothesis other things are not

485
00:17:47,539 --> 00:17:49,309
very well tested in the disease

486
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:50,779
literature

487
00:17:49,309 --> 00:17:52,909
but we can kind of make sense of them so

488
00:17:50,779 --> 00:17:54,319
plaque 8 is a domain originally

489
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:57,350
characterized in humans which is why

490
00:17:54,319 --> 00:17:58,700
it's plus sent a specific 8 but we can

491
00:17:57,349 --> 00:18:00,529
kind of make sense of it because when

492
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:02,299
you look at what this gene does in

493
00:18:00,529 --> 00:18:04,430
plants you know there's a common

494
00:18:02,299 --> 00:18:06,349
implication of it's sensing mechanical

495
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:07,610
damage and it's involved in calcium

496
00:18:06,349 --> 00:18:10,819
signaling things that make a lot of

497
00:18:07,609 --> 00:18:12,289
sense in terms of disease response and

498
00:18:10,819 --> 00:18:15,349
then we get these things that are very

499
00:18:12,289 --> 00:18:17,480
very strange and I actually you know I

500
00:18:15,349 --> 00:18:19,639
find these extremely exciting because so

501
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:21,950
many chromosome maintenance genes the

502
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:23,780
class of DNA helicase is they've been

503
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:26,779
implicated in diseases but only in

504
00:18:23,779 --> 00:18:28,730
diseases where unconstrained DNA

505
00:18:26,779 --> 00:18:30,980
replication is a logical part of the

506
00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:33,620
life cycle and other diseases strategies

507
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:35,680
so like a soybean cyst nematode they're

508
00:18:33,619 --> 00:18:38,269
trying to induce like wrap it on

509
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:39,950
unconstrained cell proliferation this is

510
00:18:38,269 --> 00:18:41,329
the first time MCM genes are showing up

511
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:43,160
and even there it's it's a little

512
00:18:41,329 --> 00:18:44,779
limited in terms of the literature is

513
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:46,600
the first time it's showing up in a

514
00:18:44,779 --> 00:18:48,470
disease like this where you don't have

515
00:18:46,599 --> 00:18:51,469
inducement by the pathogen of

516
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:53,000
unconstraint cell code one you know

517
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:54,350
general wage kind of wave it away is

518
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,359
like maybe this is a generalist stress

519
00:18:54,349 --> 00:18:58,369
response because MCM genes have also

520
00:18:56,359 --> 00:19:01,009
been implicated in response to you know

521
00:18:58,369 --> 00:19:02,929
salt stress and drought stress I have

522
00:19:01,009 --> 00:19:04,369
this kind of crazy hypothesis that it

523
00:19:02,930 --> 00:19:06,380
could be involved in neutrophil

524
00:19:04,369 --> 00:19:09,589
extracellular traps that is unspooled

525
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:12,410
chromatin but the plant releases to you

526
00:19:09,589 --> 00:19:13,639
know trap up pathogen there's a reason

527
00:19:12,410 --> 00:19:14,779
why this is kind of a crazy out there

528
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:16,400
hypothesis but I think it's really

529
00:19:14,779 --> 00:19:17,990
exciting to see something that is just

530
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:20,060
not present in the literature that we're

531
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:24,259
the first to see this and notice this

532
00:19:20,059 --> 00:19:26,179
very strong signal for these genes and

533
00:19:24,259 --> 00:19:27,710
then you know moving to necro trophy I'm

534
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:29,180
gonna kind of skip over the ones that

535
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:33,259
are induced throughout the whole

536
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:36,049
lifecycle or the whole you know range of

537
00:19:33,259 --> 00:19:39,710
times straight to so these are pfm

538
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:41,240
domains which are upregulated or many of

539
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:44,750
them are up regulated by the host

540
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:46,910
specifically during necro fee and so

541
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:49,190
again you know what we get is the

542
00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:50,600
ability to put this into words that we

543
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:51,860
can understand and kind of synthesize

544
00:19:50,599 --> 00:19:53,809
with our understanding of biology

545
00:19:51,859 --> 00:19:56,839
instead of just a long list of p-values

546
00:19:53,809 --> 00:19:59,539
and upregulation like log changes so

547
00:19:56,839 --> 00:20:00,609
adapt ins and adp ribosylation factors

548
00:19:59,539 --> 00:20:02,629
are FGM n--'s

549
00:20:00,609 --> 00:20:03,199
you know if you're familiar with them

550
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:06,260
there

551
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:09,620
bounine vesicle secretion a secretion of

552
00:20:06,259 --> 00:20:11,720
xenobiotic compounds you know good if I

553
00:20:09,619 --> 00:20:13,279
own as transferases G STS are a class of

554
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:15,200
genes we've been interested for like you

555
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:16,430
know now like a decade you know because

556
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:19,430
they have known roles in detoxification

557
00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:22,340
of pathogen compounds and in response to

558
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:25,070
nekros and then again you know sometimes

559
00:20:22,339 --> 00:20:26,720
you just get an am no apical meristem is

560
00:20:25,069 --> 00:20:27,980
just a class of transcription factor

561
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,180
domain it could be doing a million

562
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:32,180
different things it's kind of hard to

563
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:33,860
parse out but it is good to know that

564
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:34,850
that is there and recognize it and keep

565
00:20:33,859 --> 00:20:40,969
it in the literature in that like a

566
00:20:34,849 --> 00:20:42,919
usable form so these lines were made are

567
00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:45,740
these lines that we were using we're

568
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:48,380
isolines that either do or don't carry

569
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:50,599
the h2 to our gene what we know about

570
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:52,820
ht2 so it has been mapped to a pretty

571
00:20:50,599 --> 00:20:54,259
small region of chromosome eight by two

572
00:20:52,819 --> 00:20:55,339
of Rebecca's former students you know

573
00:20:54,259 --> 00:20:58,640
it's met pretty nicely

574
00:20:55,339 --> 00:21:00,349
it is incredibly near the HTN our gene

575
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:03,200
and again that was a wall associated

576
00:21:00,349 --> 00:21:04,789
kinase not the kind of cytosol like NBS

577
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:07,880
and our our gene that is common for our

578
00:21:04,789 --> 00:21:09,799
genes and there are a whole lot of

579
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:11,690
kinase genes in that region that are

580
00:21:09,799 --> 00:21:13,190
like there's dozens and dozens of pretty

581
00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:15,259
plausible candidates when you just look

582
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:16,970
at okay what genes are here what did we

583
00:21:15,259 --> 00:21:20,720
think they do do they look like known

584
00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:23,450
resistance genes and the thing that we

585
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:26,000
are you know we're using the mantra like

586
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:27,319
work hard to not work hard you know

587
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,240
somewhere in these reads in the

588
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:33,289
transcript weeds we have the Trent the

589
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:36,769
RNA sequence the coding sequence of ht2

590
00:21:33,289 --> 00:21:38,359
can we use intelligible criteria you

591
00:21:36,769 --> 00:21:41,119
know to basically parse out our very

592
00:21:38,359 --> 00:21:43,490
very long list of candidates so no we

593
00:21:41,119 --> 00:21:45,019
just came up with a list you know one by

594
00:21:43,490 --> 00:21:46,759
one of these logical criteria it should

595
00:21:45,019 --> 00:21:49,190
be in or near the mapping region you

596
00:21:46,759 --> 00:21:50,599
know it's precisely mapped but you know

597
00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:52,850
it could be at least a few hundred KB

598
00:21:50,599 --> 00:21:55,189
away does it make sense in terms of what

599
00:21:52,849 --> 00:21:56,959
sort of gene it is is it polymorphic

600
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:58,519
between the two lines because we can you

601
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:00,440
know do de novo assembly of the

602
00:21:58,519 --> 00:22:01,849
transcripts that align we can do two

603
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:04,039
novo assembly of all the transcripts and

604
00:22:01,849 --> 00:22:05,899
say okay where are the polymorphisms are

605
00:22:04,039 --> 00:22:08,029
there any how does it compare also to

606
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:10,190
what's already been sequenced in days it

607
00:22:08,029 --> 00:22:12,109
has genome sequence is it expressed in

608
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:14,000
the leaf because if it's not expressed

609
00:22:12,109 --> 00:22:15,740
base line you know just in a non

610
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,058
inoculum leaf and it's not induced it's

611
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:20,120
probably not doing anything

612
00:22:17,058 --> 00:22:22,428
from the plant and as well does it have

613
00:22:20,119 --> 00:22:24,589
higher expression in HT - because there

614
00:22:22,429 --> 00:22:25,879
are our genes where there is you know

615
00:22:24,589 --> 00:22:28,189
there are cases where there is no

616
00:22:25,878 --> 00:22:30,019
polymorphism between two alleles of an R

617
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:32,480
gene it's about the regulatory control

618
00:22:30,019 --> 00:22:35,120
of it instead so kind of looked at all

619
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:38,569
these logical criteria and it allowed us

620
00:22:35,119 --> 00:22:40,849
to narrow down our list from 100 200

621
00:22:38,569 --> 00:22:42,859
genes pretty narrowly down and I think

622
00:22:40,849 --> 00:22:44,569
we have two strong candidates for HT -

623
00:22:42,859 --> 00:22:46,308
and I think especially one of the nice

624
00:22:44,569 --> 00:22:48,798
things is when you go in and look at the

625
00:22:46,308 --> 00:22:51,648
sequence of these reads you know you can

626
00:22:48,798 --> 00:22:53,089
find things that before we're really at

627
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:55,489
the top of our list we say oh this makes

628
00:22:53,089 --> 00:22:56,689
perfect sense for HT - this is a perfect

629
00:22:55,490 --> 00:22:58,909
candidate gene and then you look and you

630
00:22:56,690 --> 00:23:00,769
say there's no polymorphism expressed

631
00:22:58,909 --> 00:23:01,850
exactly the same you can't find any

632
00:23:00,769 --> 00:23:02,868
difference between these two genes

633
00:23:01,849 --> 00:23:04,849
between the isolines

634
00:23:02,868 --> 00:23:06,648
you know we can use what we have in hand

635
00:23:04,849 --> 00:23:09,888
to say that needs to go down the list

636
00:23:06,648 --> 00:23:11,839
this other one needs to move up so the

637
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:14,479
first one is again these are both the

638
00:23:11,839 --> 00:23:16,959
protein kinase is things involved in

639
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:19,788
signal detection

640
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:22,129
it has homology to a wall associated

641
00:23:19,788 --> 00:23:23,690
kindness in rice its close-ish to the

642
00:23:22,128 --> 00:23:25,398
mapping Center not as close as we would

643
00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:27,200
like again we're at first we were

644
00:23:25,398 --> 00:23:28,729
looking at okay let's just look at the

645
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:31,819
five genes right near the mapping thing

646
00:23:28,730 --> 00:23:35,419
but we know that recombination can be

647
00:23:31,819 --> 00:23:37,128
kind of iffy in this region you know

648
00:23:35,419 --> 00:23:38,450
it's expressed in the leaf it is induced

649
00:23:37,128 --> 00:23:40,398
by n will be infection and it's

650
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:43,069
polymorphic and the other nice thing is

651
00:23:40,398 --> 00:23:45,469
that the HT - - allele pretty closely

652
00:23:43,069 --> 00:23:47,569
matches b73 which we know does not have

653
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:49,669
HT - so it fits in with what we know

654
00:23:47,569 --> 00:23:51,859
about that we did look at other genomes

655
00:23:49,669 --> 00:23:54,740
because a lot you know more and more are

656
00:23:51,859 --> 00:23:56,240
being sequenced every year but we're not

657
00:23:54,740 --> 00:24:01,009
as confident about whether or not those

658
00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:02,659
genomes have HD 2 etc second one you

659
00:24:01,009 --> 00:24:04,700
know again we've got an leucine-rich

660
00:24:02,659 --> 00:24:07,278
repeat domain which is a classical

661
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:08,538
domain involved in you know associated

662
00:24:07,278 --> 00:24:11,359
with disease resistance genes

663
00:24:08,538 --> 00:24:14,058
- protein kinase it's got much higher

664
00:24:11,359 --> 00:24:17,418
expression in our HT - plus isoline and

665
00:24:14,058 --> 00:24:20,058
again there's polymorphisms and HT - -

666
00:24:17,419 --> 00:24:21,950
allele which is from a lioness xi which

667
00:24:20,058 --> 00:24:24,589
is really similar be simply closely

668
00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:28,110
resembles b-70 freeze version of this

669
00:24:24,589 --> 00:24:30,649
team and so you know I

670
00:24:28,109 --> 00:24:33,000
we would need to we have some money for

671
00:24:30,650 --> 00:24:34,620
transgenic or transformation with net

672
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,269
Willman in the new plant transformation

673
00:24:34,619 --> 00:24:37,979
facility you know all these need to be

674
00:24:36,269 --> 00:24:39,779
confirmed but I think the nice thing

675
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:41,940
about looking at what you have in hand

676
00:24:39,779 --> 00:24:43,379
is that you can turn a list of dozens of

677
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:45,390
fairly plausible candidates they're all

678
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:50,040
baby on equal footing into two much

679
00:24:45,390 --> 00:24:52,559
stronger kids so moving from these kind

680
00:24:50,039 --> 00:24:54,089
of exploratory questions into the more

681
00:24:52,558 --> 00:24:56,339
hypothesis driven one you know we also

682
00:24:54,089 --> 00:24:58,079
do have things that we hypotheses that

683
00:24:56,339 --> 00:24:59,250
we bring to the experiment and say we

684
00:24:58,079 --> 00:25:01,379
want to know if this is true in our

685
00:24:59,250 --> 00:25:03,390
system or not and the two we'll focus on

686
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:05,549
are on the host side gene expression

687
00:25:03,390 --> 00:25:09,390
versus resistance in the field and on

688
00:25:05,548 --> 00:25:11,700
the pathogen side gene sparse region so

689
00:25:09,390 --> 00:25:14,190
the hypothesis that were bringing to the

690
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:16,410
table in terms of an OB phenotype in the

691
00:25:14,190 --> 00:25:18,179
field is that NLB resistance is related

692
00:25:16,410 --> 00:25:20,580
to the baseline expression the non

693
00:25:18,179 --> 00:25:22,740
induced expression of not an ocular

694
00:25:20,579 --> 00:25:25,139
plants of genes that are upregulated in

695
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:26,460
response to NLB there are a lot of

696
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:28,290
reasons why this is you know a

697
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:31,950
moderately plausible hypothesis or this

698
00:25:28,289 --> 00:25:33,990
might be the case you know lines can

699
00:25:31,950 --> 00:25:36,298
have a resistant line might have high

700
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:38,700
like what we call a hair-trigger might

701
00:25:36,298 --> 00:25:42,179
have high sensitivity towards fungal

702
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:43,169
domains or you know microbial signals it

703
00:25:42,179 --> 00:25:45,140
might have really high based on

704
00:25:43,169 --> 00:25:47,400
expression you know basically pre

705
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:49,140
constitutive defenses there also a lot

706
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:51,650
of reasons why this would totally not be

707
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:55,679
the case because you know induced

708
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:57,298
Express induced defenses and baseline

709
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:58,950
you know constitutive defenses are

710
00:25:57,298 --> 00:26:00,389
different for a reason you don't always

711
00:25:58,950 --> 00:26:02,850
want to be panicking and have all of

712
00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:05,700
your defensive mechanisms firing on all

713
00:26:02,849 --> 00:26:06,839
cylinders but also is because you know

714
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:08,759
one of the reasons why brought us the

715
00:26:06,839 --> 00:26:11,039
table is we had the data to ask this

716
00:26:08,759 --> 00:26:13,109
interesting question Carl Kremmling

717
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:14,909
published a paper this year which I

718
00:26:13,109 --> 00:26:16,579
think a lot of people saw off you saw

719
00:26:14,910 --> 00:26:19,558
his exit seminar it's really fascinating

720
00:26:16,579 --> 00:26:21,808
and woody you know uploaded all the data

721
00:26:19,558 --> 00:26:23,970
from this and it is gene expression in a

722
00:26:21,808 --> 00:26:26,369
lot of different tissues for the maze

723
00:26:23,970 --> 00:26:29,579
282 diversity panels so a lot of diverse

724
00:26:26,369 --> 00:26:32,279
lines Judi cochlear has taken NOP

725
00:26:29,579 --> 00:26:34,109
resistance metrics on the same panel so

726
00:26:32,279 --> 00:26:36,869
you can compare the expression of genes

727
00:26:34,109 --> 00:26:39,240
in multiple tissues to what at our

728
00:26:36,869 --> 00:26:40,259
assistant is the adult plant the way

729
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:42,039
we're doing that is just with Ridge

730
00:26:40,259 --> 00:26:43,859
regression we measure the accuracy

731
00:26:42,039 --> 00:26:47,730
predictions by 10-fold cross-validation

732
00:26:43,859 --> 00:26:49,839
say this metric of okay you know our is

733
00:26:47,730 --> 00:26:52,000
related as kind of a vague term what

734
00:26:49,839 --> 00:26:54,159
we're looking for is how well can we

735
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,660
predict NLB resistance from expression

736
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:59,400
of these genes using those as the

737
00:26:55,660 --> 00:27:03,130
predictors and so what we have here is

738
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:04,690
the y-axis is the correlation between

739
00:27:03,130 --> 00:27:07,540
the predicted and the observed values

740
00:27:04,690 --> 00:27:10,480
the x-axis is how many genes were using

741
00:27:07,539 --> 00:27:11,889
to predict and whether those genes the

742
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:13,809
two panels are whether those genes are

743
00:27:11,890 --> 00:27:15,520
just randomly sampled from the genome

744
00:27:13,809 --> 00:27:16,569
after we filtered for you know they

745
00:27:15,519 --> 00:27:18,009
should be expressed there should be

746
00:27:16,569 --> 00:27:19,750
diversity it should be a useful

747
00:27:18,009 --> 00:27:22,480
predictor we don't want to throw garbage

748
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:25,539
in there or are they from our list of

749
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:26,829
kind of NLB induced genes and then as

750
00:27:25,539 --> 00:27:28,269
you can see you know in both of them as

751
00:27:26,829 --> 00:27:31,899
you add more predictors you get a better

752
00:27:28,269 --> 00:27:33,009
prediction you know as you expect and so

753
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:34,840
what we see is when you're using the

754
00:27:33,009 --> 00:27:39,069
small amount of genes that should be

755
00:27:34,839 --> 00:27:41,439
0.16 change that but it's about twice as

756
00:27:39,069 --> 00:27:43,299
good when you're using NLB induced genes

757
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:46,090
and so what I mean by twice as good is

758
00:27:43,299 --> 00:27:47,829
that if you limit your predictors to

759
00:27:46,089 --> 00:27:49,569
genes which are induced by an O being

760
00:27:47,829 --> 00:27:51,189
you say from these I will predict and

761
00:27:49,569 --> 00:27:52,779
I'll be resistance in adult plants you

762
00:27:51,190 --> 00:27:54,549
do about twice as good a job as just

763
00:27:52,779 --> 00:27:57,549
using expression of some randomly

764
00:27:54,549 --> 00:27:58,809
sampled genes of the same number as you

765
00:27:57,549 --> 00:28:00,639
increase the number of genes that get

766
00:27:58,809 --> 00:28:02,500
you know more similar because if you

767
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:05,290
just increase the number to 35,000 genes

768
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:08,440
newbies the exact same gene sets using

769
00:28:05,289 --> 00:28:10,359
all the genes but when you're using 3000

770
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:12,009
you know there's still about a there's

771
00:28:10,359 --> 00:28:13,959
still about a point one bump in

772
00:28:12,009 --> 00:28:16,059
prediction accuracy when you're limiting

773
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:18,789
this to say I want to only use genes

774
00:28:16,059 --> 00:28:21,879
that are responsive to nobe to predict

775
00:28:18,789 --> 00:28:23,619
the adult and OB phenotype so we're

776
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:26,410
excited by this because we kind of hit a

777
00:28:23,619 --> 00:28:27,759
lot of dead ends and all there's similar

778
00:28:26,410 --> 00:28:29,290
questions and we found it's really

779
00:28:27,759 --> 00:28:33,609
interesting you know result out of

780
00:28:29,289 --> 00:28:34,930
looking through Karl's data ii a

781
00:28:33,609 --> 00:28:37,839
publicist i want to touch on is that

782
00:28:34,930 --> 00:28:39,670
gene sparse regions tend to be tend to

783
00:28:37,839 --> 00:28:41,709
have more pathogenesis related genes

784
00:28:39,670 --> 00:28:44,019
whereas gene rich regions will tend to

785
00:28:41,710 --> 00:28:46,059
have more you know basic life cycle

786
00:28:44,019 --> 00:28:48,730
genes and the reasons for this are

787
00:28:46,059 --> 00:28:52,389
numerous is coming out of their model is

788
00:28:48,730 --> 00:28:53,589
coming out of sofyan commune's lab you

789
00:28:52,390 --> 00:28:54,640
know if you have a gene sparse region

790
00:28:53,589 --> 00:28:55,629
there's going to be more strain stuff

791
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:58,180
that you're going to have warm you

792
00:28:55,630 --> 00:28:59,860
Haitians and is not the third one is not

793
00:28:58,180 --> 00:29:01,870
necessarily implied by being jeans first

794
00:28:59,859 --> 00:29:04,000
but you know one of the other metrics of

795
00:29:01,869 --> 00:29:07,029
whether it's related to pathogenesis is

796
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,809
it expressed in planta and we found

797
00:29:07,029 --> 00:29:10,180
which was really interesting is

798
00:29:07,809 --> 00:29:12,579
basically one half of this model applied

799
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:15,250
to our system so this is a heat map

800
00:29:12,579 --> 00:29:16,750
genes are bent and the x and y axis by

801
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:18,190
their distance to the nearest neighbor

802
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:20,410
and a three prime and five front

803
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:22,600
direction and the color is of all the

804
00:29:20,410 --> 00:29:24,970
genes that are that far from the nearest

805
00:29:22,599 --> 00:29:27,579
neighbor what is the mean ratio log

806
00:29:24,970 --> 00:29:30,700
transform of their implant expression to

807
00:29:27,579 --> 00:29:31,869
their control expression on a plate what

808
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:33,340
you see is that you know there's that

809
00:29:31,869 --> 00:29:34,599
red patch in the corner of genes that

810
00:29:33,339 --> 00:29:37,449
are far from both of their nearest

811
00:29:34,599 --> 00:29:40,599
neighbors basically if a gene is over 10

812
00:29:37,450 --> 00:29:43,450
KB from a neighboring gene on either

813
00:29:40,599 --> 00:29:46,629
side the average ratio of in planta to a

814
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:50,230
zenok expression is about 200 versus a

815
00:29:46,630 --> 00:29:51,610
baseline of about 1 so we see that

816
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:53,710
playing out essentially in a pepper

817
00:29:51,609 --> 00:29:55,779
system you know gene sparse regions do

818
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:57,160
have genes that are highly expressed in

819
00:29:55,779 --> 00:29:59,670
plaintive but we don't say the other

820
00:29:57,160 --> 00:30:02,380
half of the hypothesis this is a similar

821
00:29:59,670 --> 00:30:04,660
or of the models this is a similar heat

822
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:06,160
map you've got KB in both directions and

823
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:08,830
the color scale is the mean log

824
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:10,690
transformed D and yes that is the ratio

825
00:30:08,829 --> 00:30:13,599
of nonsynonymous to synonymous

826
00:30:10,690 --> 00:30:15,850
substitutions LOD nds means you have

827
00:30:13,599 --> 00:30:18,250
very few nonsynonymous substitutions so

828
00:30:15,849 --> 00:30:20,289
that is you know anything new is being

829
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:22,480
purged that stabilizing selection very

830
00:30:20,289 --> 00:30:24,220
high D MDS is you've got you know

831
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:26,410
selection for diversity functional

832
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:28,329
diversity and essentially what we saw is

833
00:30:26,410 --> 00:30:30,340
that you know genes and gene sparse

834
00:30:28,329 --> 00:30:31,929
regions were not any faster to evolve so

835
00:30:30,339 --> 00:30:36,970
we only get half of the model being

836
00:30:31,930 --> 00:30:40,000
confirmed so backing up you know

837
00:30:36,970 --> 00:30:42,480
somewhat backing up to our entire model

838
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:44,349
that we think about resistance under

839
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:45,970
we've been looking really at the

840
00:30:44,349 --> 00:30:48,099
molecular scale you know in looking at

841
00:30:45,970 --> 00:30:50,200
just a few genotypes but again you know

842
00:30:48,099 --> 00:30:51,909
our group does a lot of field work we're

843
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:54,309
gonna move over to the extremely

844
00:30:51,910 --> 00:30:56,590
extremely macro scale and thinking about

845
00:30:54,309 --> 00:30:58,149
things on you know rather than thinking

846
00:30:56,589 --> 00:31:00,039
about them on the tiny centimeter sample

847
00:30:58,150 --> 00:31:03,340
scale think about them on the meters and

848
00:31:00,039 --> 00:31:05,139
kilometers or at least acres scale so

849
00:31:03,339 --> 00:31:08,669
the project that's been funding me for

850
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:10,560
the past two years has

851
00:31:08,670 --> 00:31:12,840
basically centered around detecting

852
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:14,970
enemy lesions from aerial images from

853
00:31:12,839 --> 00:31:16,829
UAVs unmanned aerial vehicles which is

854
00:31:14,970 --> 00:31:22,230
how everybody prefers to say drones now

855
00:31:16,829 --> 00:31:23,789
it sounds friendlier and so there's lots

856
00:31:22,230 --> 00:31:25,380
of reasons you know I think many of us

857
00:31:23,789 --> 00:31:27,509
now have heard various justifications

858
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:30,570
for why people phenotyping is useful you

859
00:31:27,509 --> 00:31:32,220
know you want to have you want to remove

860
00:31:30,569 --> 00:31:34,710
that bottleneck on all of your progress

861
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:36,960
you want to be have phenotyping that's

862
00:31:34,710 --> 00:31:38,730
on the same scale and speed and accuracy

863
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:40,319
as you're genotyping but it's specific

864
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:42,110
about NLB you know in this specific

865
00:31:40,319 --> 00:31:44,220
context why would you want to do this

866
00:31:42,109 --> 00:31:45,779
there's kind of two groups of answers

867
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:47,220
the first is for being in genetics

868
00:31:45,779 --> 00:31:49,319
actually think probably the most

869
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:52,319
relevant answer is that if you are

870
00:31:49,319 --> 00:31:53,609
already flying a drone which i think is

871
00:31:52,319 --> 00:31:55,529
gonna be more and more common for more

872
00:31:53,609 --> 00:31:57,629
and more breeding programs you know if

873
00:31:55,529 --> 00:31:59,399
you already have the images adding on

874
00:31:57,630 --> 00:32:01,110
and you already have a pipeline that is

875
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:04,200
fairly simple to use adding on another

876
00:32:01,109 --> 00:32:05,549
trait as much as difficult than you know

877
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:09,000
doubling the amount of traits you score

878
00:32:05,549 --> 00:32:11,639
in the field you know obviously want

879
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:13,529
higher precision accuracy so Jesse

880
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:16,080
Pollan from our lab did some studies on

881
00:32:13,529 --> 00:32:17,819
human accuracy for NLB short answer is

882
00:32:16,079 --> 00:32:20,609
people are good but there's certainly

883
00:32:17,819 --> 00:32:22,409
room for improvement and then I think

884
00:32:20,609 --> 00:32:24,689
one was especially relevant for NOP is

885
00:32:22,410 --> 00:32:26,630
that the main metric we take is after

886
00:32:24,690 --> 00:32:29,160
flowering so that in a breeding program

887
00:32:26,630 --> 00:32:31,800
what we measure is later in the season

888
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:33,720
you know far after flowering what we

889
00:32:31,799 --> 00:32:35,759
measure is the percentage of diseased

890
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:38,339
leaf area it's very hard to score a

891
00:32:35,759 --> 00:32:41,220
large area for pre flowering disease

892
00:32:38,339 --> 00:32:44,220
traits because you're looking for pretty

893
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:45,480
rare lesions or you're looking for

894
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:46,860
something pretty rare so I think this

895
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:48,329
would you know if you can measure

896
00:32:46,859 --> 00:32:50,089
something pre flowering you can also

897
00:32:48,329 --> 00:32:53,909
choose the male parent and say you

898
00:32:50,089 --> 00:32:54,959
theoretically double your gains but also

899
00:32:53,910 --> 00:32:56,610
you know we don't work really in

900
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:58,259
management we don't really work on

901
00:32:56,609 --> 00:32:59,939
fungicides or things of that age but we

902
00:32:58,259 --> 00:33:01,859
want to be also be aware of how this

903
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:03,870
could be useful for management I think

904
00:33:01,859 --> 00:33:05,519
similar thing more traits at once I

905
00:33:03,869 --> 00:33:06,629
think you know all growers wanted in

906
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:07,950
fort they want to know whether it's

907
00:33:06,630 --> 00:33:10,500
worth it to spray their fields with

908
00:33:07,950 --> 00:33:13,350
fungicide given corn prices and the

909
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:14,190
probability of disease loss and one

910
00:33:13,349 --> 00:33:16,709
that's pretty you know

911
00:33:14,190 --> 00:33:18,299
like far out in the future but a few

912
00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:19,950
groups are working on its variable rate

913
00:33:18,299 --> 00:33:21,720
fungicide application I think this is

914
00:33:19,950 --> 00:33:22,450
really exciting for larger areas you

915
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:23,740
know if you

916
00:33:22,450 --> 00:33:25,210
wet spot in your field that's someone

917
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:28,029
that's gonna get hammered most likely

918
00:33:25,210 --> 00:33:29,350
with disease worse and so if you can or

919
00:33:28,029 --> 00:33:31,809
if you know it's coming from a direction

920
00:33:29,349 --> 00:33:36,279
you know you can use the epidemiology of

921
00:33:31,809 --> 00:33:36,940
it to save money so how did this project

922
00:33:36,279 --> 00:33:38,289
work

923
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:40,690
you know we have field experiments of

924
00:33:38,289 --> 00:33:44,379
various sizes you take drone images of

925
00:33:40,690 --> 00:33:48,220
them thanks to tireless work from ethan

926
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:50,650
thick sr by Gore's lab go into some of

927
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:52,630
the troubleshooting of that we use human

928
00:33:50,650 --> 00:33:54,190
annotations so basically showing where

929
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:56,860
the lesions are and we feed that into a

930
00:33:54,190 --> 00:33:59,049
convolutional neural network CNN I'm

931
00:33:56,859 --> 00:34:01,059
going to try to explain this briefly

932
00:33:59,049 --> 00:34:02,769
including what a CNN is because I think

933
00:34:01,059 --> 00:34:05,859
it's it's relevant for how all this

934
00:34:02,769 --> 00:34:07,599
project works so a CNN is a class of

935
00:34:05,859 --> 00:34:10,210
machine learning model it is the current

936
00:34:07,599 --> 00:34:12,400
standard for recognizing objects from

937
00:34:10,210 --> 00:34:13,929
images you know just in an automated

938
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:16,869
sense so when you upload a picture to

939
00:34:13,929 --> 00:34:18,730
Facebook and it says oh this is Kyle's

940
00:34:16,869 --> 00:34:21,039
face do you want to tag Kyle on this

941
00:34:18,730 --> 00:34:23,769
what it is using is a CNN that has been

942
00:34:21,039 --> 00:34:25,480
trained on images of Kyle's face so

943
00:34:23,769 --> 00:34:26,980
that's what it's using and it's the same

944
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:28,990
with you know all of googles things any

945
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:31,599
self-driving car are using this basic

946
00:34:28,989 --> 00:34:34,419
form of model it sounds more complicated

947
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:36,039
than the math behind it actually is the

948
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:37,809
central things these convolutional

949
00:34:36,039 --> 00:34:39,670
layers of convolution is a mathematical

950
00:34:37,809 --> 00:34:41,710
function that you can apply to matrices

951
00:34:39,670 --> 00:34:44,079
these layers have filters which are

952
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:45,880
different matrices you slide the matrix

953
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:49,170
across an image which can also be

954
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:51,340
thought of as a matrix of n dimensions

955
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:53,619
and then essentially what it gives you

956
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:57,280
is this it gives you a high value

957
00:34:53,619 --> 00:34:59,259
essentially where it sees a type of

958
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:00,430
feature and on the bottom layer it's a

959
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:02,590
pretty simple feature so it might be

960
00:35:00,429 --> 00:35:04,149
vertical lines or the color blue or

961
00:35:02,590 --> 00:35:05,890
something like that there's a pooling

962
00:35:04,150 --> 00:35:07,480
layer which all that is is it's down

963
00:35:05,889 --> 00:35:08,949
sampling the resolution like when you

964
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:10,389
shrink an image and there's a higher

965
00:35:08,949 --> 00:35:13,179
convolutional layer that is looking at

966
00:35:10,389 --> 00:35:14,619
combinations of the previous filters so

967
00:35:13,179 --> 00:35:16,089
every time you move up a layer you're

968
00:35:14,619 --> 00:35:18,639
looking at more and more complex

969
00:35:16,090 --> 00:35:20,050
combinations of the layers below and

970
00:35:18,639 --> 00:35:21,549
when you get to something on the third

971
00:35:20,050 --> 00:35:25,420
level that's where you start saying okay

972
00:35:21,550 --> 00:35:27,670
one of these 256 filters is going to

973
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:29,650
respond to lesions one of them might

974
00:35:27,670 --> 00:35:31,450
racino or if you're optimizing it for

975
00:35:29,650 --> 00:35:34,210
faces this is going to respond to Kyle's

976
00:35:31,449 --> 00:35:35,949
face and then ultimately you can use

977
00:35:34,210 --> 00:35:40,000
that to predict whether there's a lead

978
00:35:35,949 --> 00:35:42,250
in the image or not or so the first

979
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,900
phase is you know the majority of it

980
00:35:42,250 --> 00:35:46,719
which is annotated lesions train the

981
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:48,760
neural network and see how it does so we

982
00:35:46,719 --> 00:35:50,379
have multiple field experiments you know

983
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:53,140
we're always running different disease

984
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:56,039
trials and we need to image those there

985
00:35:53,139 --> 00:35:58,779
are a lot of challenges to imaging a

986
00:35:56,039 --> 00:36:00,670
field an entire field at the level where

987
00:35:58,780 --> 00:36:02,079
you can see NLB lesions I mean these

988
00:36:00,670 --> 00:36:05,050
things are centimetres to millimetres

989
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:06,070
you know in size when you capture the

990
00:36:05,050 --> 00:36:07,690
images we want these to be really

991
00:36:06,070 --> 00:36:09,160
high-resolution much higher than people

992
00:36:07,690 --> 00:36:11,980
are normally taking when they use drones

993
00:36:09,159 --> 00:36:13,629
and economy which means that you need

994
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:15,219
low altitude you need low cut which

995
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:16,539
gives you little coverage you need to be

996
00:36:15,219 --> 00:36:19,029
flying slowly because we don't want

997
00:36:16,539 --> 00:36:21,130
motion blur once we analyze the images

998
00:36:19,030 --> 00:36:23,530
you know we can't trust just anybody to

999
00:36:21,130 --> 00:36:25,119
analyze NLP so the way that Google and

1000
00:36:23,530 --> 00:36:27,670
Facebook do it is they outsource all of

1001
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:29,740
their annotations by looking at what who

1002
00:36:27,670 --> 00:36:31,630
you've tagged you know anytime that the

1003
00:36:29,739 --> 00:36:33,459
website asks you if you're human or not

1004
00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:35,349
and says click on all of the street

1005
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:37,030
signs or transcribe this image or

1006
00:36:35,349 --> 00:36:40,630
something they are using you to

1007
00:36:37,030 --> 00:36:43,119
outsource what they want to train a

1008
00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:44,559
self-driving car to do they're usually

1009
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:46,358
they've used you to outsource all that

1010
00:36:44,559 --> 00:36:48,099
work but obviously you know a random

1011
00:36:46,358 --> 00:36:51,009
person can't just say oh this is an OB

1012
00:36:48,099 --> 00:36:55,539
you know we also need a vast amount of

1013
00:36:51,010 --> 00:36:57,220
data to train a CNN so we kind of run

1014
00:36:55,539 --> 00:36:59,529
out this thing of human annotation it

1015
00:36:57,219 --> 00:37:01,209
was just a wall that we climbed over so

1016
00:36:59,530 --> 00:37:03,040
what I mean by human annotation is we

1017
00:37:01,210 --> 00:37:05,170
first tried just saying ok here's images

1018
00:37:03,039 --> 00:37:07,088
with an OB here's the ones without it

1019
00:37:05,170 --> 00:37:08,619
works super well so we have to count the

1020
00:37:07,088 --> 00:37:11,108
next level of detail which is okay

1021
00:37:08,619 --> 00:37:12,519
here's an picture a lot of lesions in

1022
00:37:11,108 --> 00:37:15,009
here this is actually off the drone it's

1023
00:37:12,519 --> 00:37:16,900
not cropped at all this is the actual

1024
00:37:15,010 --> 00:37:20,950
resolution that we were getting thanks

1025
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:23,289
Nick thanks Ethan draw a line down the

1026
00:37:20,949 --> 00:37:25,118
axis do it for the next station do it

1027
00:37:23,289 --> 00:37:26,469
for the next station do it for all the

1028
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:28,660
lesions of the image and then do that a

1029
00:37:26,469 --> 00:37:32,588
hundred thousand more times as a kid

1030
00:37:28,659 --> 00:37:33,879
imagine this was not fun it was mine but

1031
00:37:32,588 --> 00:37:36,119
ultimately that's the scale that we

1032
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:38,710
needed to train these models accurately

1033
00:37:36,119 --> 00:37:40,660
it's ultimately what we do is then feed

1034
00:37:38,710 --> 00:37:42,099
them into the CNN we have some really

1035
00:37:40,659 --> 00:37:45,639
great computer science collaborators

1036
00:37:42,099 --> 00:37:48,849
formerly at Cornell now at Columbia and

1037
00:37:45,639 --> 00:37:49,719
what can we do so like in the simplest

1038
00:37:48,849 --> 00:37:51,640
view what can be

1039
00:37:49,719 --> 00:37:53,858
now we do that we could not before they

1040
00:37:51,639 --> 00:37:55,389
can take a handheld image beat it

1041
00:37:53,858 --> 00:37:57,159
through a network that has been trained

1042
00:37:55,389 --> 00:37:58,598
on tens of thousands of examples of what

1043
00:37:57,159 --> 00:38:00,368
a lesion looks like and where it is in

1044
00:37:58,599 --> 00:38:02,920
an image you can get out of heat map

1045
00:38:00,369 --> 00:38:06,340
where it says I think these regions are

1046
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:08,079
NLB you know we can do this same with an

1047
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:12,460
aerial image so again this is an on crop

1048
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:14,170
this is straight off the drone we can

1049
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:16,420
feed that into the network and then you

1050
00:38:14,170 --> 00:38:17,710
can see this is a little bit greater as

1051
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:19,599
it were but you can do the same exact

1052
00:38:17,710 --> 00:38:22,869
thing you know here black is where they

1053
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:24,280
seize the lesions and you know just

1054
00:38:22,869 --> 00:38:25,510
flipping from one to the other you can

1055
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:26,890
see okay it's getting that it's getting

1056
00:38:25,510 --> 00:38:29,980
that it's getting there it's getting

1057
00:38:26,889 --> 00:38:31,389
this little one here so before I get to

1058
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:33,309
the question that's the natural next

1059
00:38:31,389 --> 00:38:35,348
question which is how well are we doing

1060
00:38:33,309 --> 00:38:37,059
this or how good of a job are we doing I

1061
00:38:35,349 --> 00:38:39,460
want to bring in one last point which is

1062
00:38:37,059 --> 00:38:41,739
the idea of consensus so similar to when

1063
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:43,300
you have a jar full of jelly beans and

1064
00:38:41,739 --> 00:38:44,618
if you have three people guessed the

1065
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:46,180
mean of their guests is almost always

1066
00:38:44,619 --> 00:38:48,190
going to be better than any individual

1067
00:38:46,179 --> 00:38:49,659
guests you know the consensus of

1068
00:38:48,190 --> 00:38:52,269
multiple people the mean of their guests

1069
00:38:49,659 --> 00:38:54,190
is usually the most accurate same

1070
00:38:52,269 --> 00:38:55,420
concept here if you sub sample your

1071
00:38:54,190 --> 00:38:57,220
image data and your training data

1072
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:58,750
slightly differently train three

1073
00:38:57,219 --> 00:39:00,098
slightly different CNN's you'll get

1074
00:38:58,750 --> 00:39:03,219
three slightly different predictions

1075
00:39:00,099 --> 00:39:04,838
which is that same image and here are

1076
00:39:03,219 --> 00:39:06,489
the three a B and C we were calling them

1077
00:39:04,838 --> 00:39:09,699
you know here are the heat maps from the

1078
00:39:06,489 --> 00:39:13,719
three here are the heat maps from the

1079
00:39:09,699 --> 00:39:15,250
three prediction networks and you can

1080
00:39:13,719 --> 00:39:16,569
see you know this one maybe is the one

1081
00:39:15,250 --> 00:39:18,250
on the left is maybe a little bit too

1082
00:39:16,570 --> 00:39:19,900
sensitive but that could be useful you

1083
00:39:18,250 --> 00:39:24,250
know when you're looking under different

1084
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:26,559
light conditions so how good of a job do

1085
00:39:24,250 --> 00:39:28,358
these networks do you know on hand-held

1086
00:39:26,559 --> 00:39:31,059
images it's reaching ultimately about

1087
00:39:28,358 --> 00:39:32,259
97% accuracy and you can see the

1088
00:39:31,059 --> 00:39:33,820
validation set here you've got like

1089
00:39:32,260 --> 00:39:35,500
ninety percent accuracy where there each

1090
00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:38,019
one and then when you combine them you

1091
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:40,059
get about 98 the difference between a

1092
00:39:38,019 --> 00:39:41,769
validation in a test set is that a

1093
00:39:40,059 --> 00:39:43,779
validation set is one that you can test

1094
00:39:41,769 --> 00:39:45,429
how good you're doing and then you know

1095
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:47,410
maybe go back and say okay this method

1096
00:39:45,429 --> 00:39:49,088
didn't work let's go use this method

1097
00:39:47,409 --> 00:39:50,618
where as the test set you leave until

1098
00:39:49,088 --> 00:39:54,279
the very end and only look at once

1099
00:39:50,619 --> 00:39:56,349
because if you optimize your if you

1100
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:57,670
optimize your model by looking at how it

1101
00:39:56,349 --> 00:39:58,809
does in the validation set and then you

1102
00:39:57,670 --> 00:40:00,519
test them in the validation set

1103
00:39:58,809 --> 00:40:02,090
obviously it's going to do a little bit

1104
00:40:00,519 --> 00:40:05,329
better

1105
00:40:02,090 --> 00:40:07,220
and the UAV images you know here's on

1106
00:40:05,329 --> 00:40:08,299
the XS you can see the epochs which is

1107
00:40:07,219 --> 00:40:11,119
like the different rounds of

1108
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:12,860
optimization of the CNN and the y-axis

1109
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:17,059
is the accuracy and it ultimately hit

1110
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:18,530
tested accuracy of about 95% so 95% is

1111
00:40:17,059 --> 00:40:19,880
fairly good but you can imagine if you

1112
00:40:18,530 --> 00:40:21,650
were flying over a field and you looked

1113
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:23,000
at a hundred thousand corn plants you

1114
00:40:21,650 --> 00:40:24,559
know you'd be getting five thousand

1115
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:26,690
false positive it says and OB is here

1116
00:40:24,559 --> 00:40:27,650
where it's not which is unacceptable you

1117
00:40:26,690 --> 00:40:31,400
know first you're trying to screen a

1118
00:40:27,650 --> 00:40:32,599
large area so what we want to do what

1119
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:34,160
I'm working on right now is basically

1120
00:40:32,599 --> 00:40:36,139
supplementing annotations using

1121
00:40:34,159 --> 00:40:38,960
crowdsourcing to improve our networks

1122
00:40:36,139 --> 00:40:40,789
performance so again this is what we

1123
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:43,909
were doing so far we literally just went

1124
00:40:40,789 --> 00:40:45,739
through and drew lines at a hundred

1125
00:40:43,909 --> 00:40:48,139
thousand lesions and use that to train

1126
00:40:45,739 --> 00:40:49,819
the network and we've talked about using

1127
00:40:48,139 --> 00:40:51,289
polygons you know circling the lesions

1128
00:40:49,820 --> 00:40:52,640
but we just said there's no way we can

1129
00:40:51,289 --> 00:40:56,210
make that many you know it's just too

1130
00:40:52,639 --> 00:40:58,879
much of a time constraint but why do we

1131
00:40:56,210 --> 00:41:00,320
want polygons so here's an example this

1132
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:01,789
is an image from a group actually also

1133
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:04,550
at Cornell who's training a network to

1134
00:41:01,789 --> 00:41:06,019
recognize materials like carpet wood and

1135
00:41:04,550 --> 00:41:08,150
cement and things like that

1136
00:41:06,019 --> 00:41:09,800
here's what their network saw when it

1137
00:41:08,150 --> 00:41:11,750
was trained on point click so something

1138
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:13,190
like click three points on the carpet

1139
00:41:11,750 --> 00:41:15,530
quick three points on something made of

1140
00:41:13,190 --> 00:41:17,750
wood here's what it saw when it was fed

1141
00:41:15,530 --> 00:41:18,860
polygons of that same thing so you can

1142
00:41:17,750 --> 00:41:20,389
see you know you're getting these crisp

1143
00:41:18,860 --> 00:41:22,789
annotations can defeating it a vast

1144
00:41:20,389 --> 00:41:24,349
amount more data when you circle all of

1145
00:41:22,789 --> 00:41:27,380
the points that are wood or carpet or

1146
00:41:24,349 --> 00:41:29,719
whatever than just clicking so we're

1147
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:31,519
essentially you know on the same points

1148
00:41:29,719 --> 00:41:32,509
one and two we have our images we've

1149
00:41:31,519 --> 00:41:34,099
trained them on fairly low resolution

1150
00:41:32,510 --> 00:41:36,230
things but we're getting these kind of

1151
00:41:34,099 --> 00:41:38,119
blobs out it knows there is a lesion

1152
00:41:36,230 --> 00:41:39,260
there it has learned to recognize Asians

1153
00:41:38,119 --> 00:41:40,909
but we're not getting these crisp

1154
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:44,540
outlines so we want to get polygon

1155
00:41:40,909 --> 00:41:45,949
annotations so the task is fairly

1156
00:41:44,539 --> 00:41:48,079
straightforward draw boundaries around

1157
00:41:45,949 --> 00:41:50,839
all lesions in this image do that a

1158
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:52,610
hundred thousand times and the way that

1159
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:53,900
we kind of went around this is divided

1160
00:41:52,610 --> 00:41:54,650
up into two things we've already done

1161
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:57,349
this thing on the left

1162
00:41:54,650 --> 00:41:59,660
find the lesion which you know we tried

1163
00:41:57,349 --> 00:42:01,730
shopping that out to anonymous online

1164
00:41:59,659 --> 00:42:03,109
workers it did not work they are not

1165
00:42:01,730 --> 00:42:06,619
trained pathologist I've never seen

1166
00:42:03,110 --> 00:42:08,090
northern leaf blight not a surprise we

1167
00:42:06,619 --> 00:42:11,059
found is that when we basically do that

1168
00:42:08,090 --> 00:42:12,740
and then pass it over to people who

1169
00:42:11,059 --> 00:42:15,500
aren't experts you know we just randomly

1170
00:42:12,739 --> 00:42:15,959
hire for this task if actually works

1171
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:18,239
pretty well

1172
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:19,769
so I set up a platform and Amazon's

1173
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:22,319
Mechanical Turk we were using it for a

1174
00:42:19,769 --> 00:42:24,480
couple different tests as well working

1175
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:26,150
on annotation of like grassy weeds but

1176
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:28,289
you can see is this is what they got

1177
00:42:26,150 --> 00:42:29,760
what we gave to them and they got pretty

1178
00:42:28,289 --> 00:42:31,529
minimal instruction - ewwww

1179
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:32,790
oh and Mechanical Turk is an online

1180
00:42:31,530 --> 00:42:35,400
platform where you could hire people

1181
00:42:32,789 --> 00:42:38,690
anonymous on my workers for simple tasks

1182
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:41,250
and they're typically paid by the task

1183
00:42:38,690 --> 00:42:43,590
and this is what the three people did so

1184
00:42:41,250 --> 00:42:44,849
you can see the outlines of red the area

1185
00:42:43,590 --> 00:42:46,320
of all three in green I mean they

1186
00:42:44,849 --> 00:42:50,460
honestly did a pretty good job I'm

1187
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:52,320
guessing that none of them had like had

1188
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:54,119
much experience with this specific corn

1189
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:56,100
disease maybe they have they might've

1190
00:42:54,119 --> 00:42:57,719
venturing pathologists but I'm just

1191
00:42:56,099 --> 00:43:00,150
taking a stab that none of these people

1192
00:42:57,719 --> 00:43:02,489
they just you know humans can recognize

1193
00:43:00,150 --> 00:43:08,519
objects and file directions fairly well

1194
00:43:02,489 --> 00:43:10,229
other times they don't say hey so a lot

1195
00:43:08,519 --> 00:43:12,000
of this there was just a lot of data

1196
00:43:10,230 --> 00:43:13,230
sanitation that needs to happen with

1197
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,519
this you know when are you obviously are

1198
00:43:13,230 --> 00:43:15,990
shopping stuff out and this is why we

1199
00:43:14,519 --> 00:43:19,259
haven't do it you know three people do

1200
00:43:15,989 --> 00:43:20,969
each task but ultimately it worked

1201
00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:22,500
fairly well so we were kind of thinking

1202
00:43:20,969 --> 00:43:23,939
and this mantra has come up a lot in the

1203
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:27,300
project with his fast cheap and good

1204
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:29,099
pick - in terms of cheap so we're paying

1205
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:31,920
about twelve cents per lesion for cents

1206
00:43:29,099 --> 00:43:35,969
to each person then one of that big at

1207
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:37,950
three and then one goes to Amazon its

1208
00:43:35,969 --> 00:43:39,689
blazingly fast so I think we're actually

1209
00:43:37,949 --> 00:43:41,250
paying a lot more than most I've looked

1210
00:43:39,690 --> 00:43:43,170
at a lot of other people's things we're

1211
00:43:41,250 --> 00:43:44,610
paying like several times more than most

1212
00:43:43,170 --> 00:43:45,119
of their tests so we get it done in a

1213
00:43:44,610 --> 00:43:46,860
few hours

1214
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:49,199
if you post ten thousand things it'll be

1215
00:43:46,860 --> 00:43:50,250
done later that day and then the

1216
00:43:49,199 --> 00:43:52,949
ultimate question is how's the quality

1217
00:43:50,250 --> 00:43:55,139
how are these people doing so this is a

1218
00:43:52,949 --> 00:43:57,480
histogram of the overlap between all

1219
00:43:55,139 --> 00:43:59,579
pairs of polygons so the overlap is the

1220
00:43:57,480 --> 00:44:01,920
area of the intersect of them of the two

1221
00:43:59,579 --> 00:44:04,440
of them over the area of the union of

1222
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:06,389
both of them so how much does it overlap

1223
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:08,909
and it's between pairs of polygons in

1224
00:44:06,389 --> 00:44:11,789
one set of annotations that I put up on

1225
00:44:08,909 --> 00:44:14,069
em Turk and we can see is basically

1226
00:44:11,789 --> 00:44:15,779
three things first is that most of these

1227
00:44:14,070 --> 00:44:17,370
annotations are like around 75 percent

1228
00:44:15,780 --> 00:44:18,990
overlap which when you look at it like

1229
00:44:17,369 --> 00:44:20,789
on an image like that's pretty good for

1230
00:44:18,989 --> 00:44:25,139
these you know things that are taken

1231
00:44:20,789 --> 00:44:26,759
literally from a moving drone there is a

1232
00:44:25,139 --> 00:44:28,259
small subset of workers who are just

1233
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:29,250
drawing random garbage but it turns out

1234
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:29,760
actually thankfully they're pretty easy

1235
00:44:29,250 --> 00:44:32,460
to fill

1236
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:34,050
they'll because these lesions are you

1237
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:35,550
know they're only taking up like 10% 5%

1238
00:44:34,050 --> 00:44:37,200
of an image so it's really easy to see

1239
00:44:35,550 --> 00:44:38,730
when somebody's just you know putting in

1240
00:44:37,199 --> 00:44:40,889
garbage and we found out that was

1241
00:44:38,730 --> 00:44:42,000
actually pretty nice and then a lot of

1242
00:44:40,889 --> 00:44:44,639
the stuff in the middle is also useful

1243
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:46,110
because what you found is that when we

1244
00:44:44,639 --> 00:44:47,250
when you look at an imaging like this is

1245
00:44:46,110 --> 00:44:49,200
kind of blurry but I think there's a

1246
00:44:47,250 --> 00:44:50,460
lesion here and then you hand that image

1247
00:44:49,199 --> 00:44:52,019
to three people who are generally

1248
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:54,179
competent and seem to be doing a good

1249
00:44:52,019 --> 00:44:55,559
job and none of the three of them can

1250
00:44:54,179 --> 00:44:57,119
agree on where it is you probably gave

1251
00:44:55,559 --> 00:44:58,799
them a bad image so this is actually

1252
00:44:57,119 --> 00:45:01,049
serving as a nice I went back and looked

1253
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:03,060
at hundreds of these images where people

1254
00:45:01,050 --> 00:45:04,680
who otherwise generally did well were

1255
00:45:03,059 --> 00:45:06,239
like could not agree on where the lesion

1256
00:45:04,679 --> 00:45:08,489
was and it was a really nice chest

1257
00:45:06,239 --> 00:45:09,419
basically say this image like we

1258
00:45:08,489 --> 00:45:10,589
shouldn't be feeding this into our

1259
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:15,329
network it's you know low-quality

1260
00:45:10,590 --> 00:45:19,920
there's blur no.33 reasonable people

1261
00:45:15,329 --> 00:45:21,509
can't agree on what the lesion is and so

1262
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:23,400
now kind of we're wrapping up the very

1263
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:25,530
last piece which is how much does is

1264
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:26,849
improve CNN performance once we've got

1265
00:45:25,530 --> 00:45:28,830
these things that basically move from a

1266
00:45:26,849 --> 00:45:30,480
crude line that is kind of drawn down

1267
00:45:28,829 --> 00:45:32,940
the X so the lesion as best I could get

1268
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:36,929
to these polygons how much are we

1269
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:39,389
improved so again dipping back to the

1270
00:45:36,929 --> 00:45:41,399
what can we do side you know it is

1271
00:45:39,389 --> 00:45:43,500
exciting our group was the first group

1272
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:46,650
who and I think still is the only group

1273
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:49,579
who has done recognition of diseases in

1274
00:45:46,650 --> 00:45:52,590
the field of just images taken you know

1275
00:45:49,579 --> 00:45:54,449
just without any sort of like correction

1276
00:45:52,590 --> 00:45:56,490
or clipping a belief and putting out on

1277
00:45:54,449 --> 00:45:58,319
background the sort of thing that you

1278
00:45:56,489 --> 00:46:00,029
could attach to a tractor or just walk

1279
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:02,970
in the field take on your smartphone

1280
00:46:00,030 --> 00:46:04,980
with no background you know take from a

1281
00:46:02,969 --> 00:46:06,809
drone so it is really exciting there but

1282
00:46:04,980 --> 00:46:08,159
obviously you know looking at this heat

1283
00:46:06,809 --> 00:46:13,170
map we want to be able to get that more

1284
00:46:08,159 --> 00:46:14,909
refined into better so moving back to

1285
00:46:13,170 --> 00:46:20,360
the micro and macro kind of final

1286
00:46:14,909 --> 00:46:22,739
thoughts section you know it's as I'm

1287
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:24,150
writing things it like and when you look

1288
00:46:22,739 --> 00:46:25,889
at all the projects together it can seem

1289
00:46:24,150 --> 00:46:27,480
kind of disparate cuz you're like okay

1290
00:46:25,889 --> 00:46:29,219
well here's an rna-seq experiment and

1291
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:30,990
then here's machine learning with drone

1292
00:46:29,219 --> 00:46:32,129
images they they seem kind of disparate

1293
00:46:30,989 --> 00:46:33,959
even though they're about the same type

1294
00:46:32,130 --> 00:46:36,599
of system but I think the valuable thing

1295
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:38,220
about that is that you know there's

1296
00:46:36,599 --> 00:46:39,779
plenty of stuff known and there's really

1297
00:46:38,219 --> 00:46:41,569
fascinating literature and components to

1298
00:46:39,780 --> 00:46:43,680
each of these scales of resistance and

1299
00:46:41,570 --> 00:46:46,079
you have to design different

1300
00:46:43,679 --> 00:46:47,750
to understand each of them but then also

1301
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:50,849
you know the different scales kind of

1302
00:46:47,750 --> 00:46:52,289
which I say this cover for what the

1303
00:46:50,849 --> 00:46:53,609
other scales can't tell you so when

1304
00:46:52,289 --> 00:46:55,318
you're on the molecular scale you can

1305
00:46:53,608 --> 00:46:56,969
see okay here is something that's

1306
00:46:55,318 --> 00:46:59,099
invisible to the either it's happening

1307
00:46:56,969 --> 00:47:01,500
you know on a molecular scale of this

1308
00:46:59,099 --> 00:47:03,359
molecule interacting with that one you

1309
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:04,679
know but it's not always taken into

1310
00:47:03,358 --> 00:47:06,179
account the fact that the pathogen is

1311
00:47:04,679 --> 00:47:07,588
moving through this three-dimensional

1312
00:47:06,179 --> 00:47:09,210
leaf which is trying to fight it off in

1313
00:47:07,588 --> 00:47:10,349
different ways at different points you

1314
00:47:09,210 --> 00:47:12,240
know a three-dimensional structure that

1315
00:47:10,349 --> 00:47:13,230
fights that when we're doing green

1316
00:47:12,239 --> 00:47:16,199
health and growth chamber experiments

1317
00:47:13,230 --> 00:47:18,030
you know we don't usually have the room

1318
00:47:16,199 --> 00:47:20,250
or the space or the ability at a time

1319
00:47:18,030 --> 00:47:22,200
you know deploy things which is looking

1320
00:47:20,250 --> 00:47:24,000
at diversity on the hundreds of plant

1321
00:47:22,199 --> 00:47:25,529
scales looking at natural diversity

1322
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:27,659
where are the genes how do they perform

1323
00:47:25,530 --> 00:47:29,040
the field and then when we perform in

1324
00:47:27,659 --> 00:47:30,719
the field you know we're limited by how

1325
00:47:29,039 --> 00:47:32,759
much humans can get everyone who does

1326
00:47:30,719 --> 00:47:34,858
field work knows that at some point you

1327
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:36,210
just physically can't get anymore hours

1328
00:47:34,858 --> 00:47:39,719
out of the week and out of your

1329
00:47:36,210 --> 00:47:41,429
undergrads and so that's you know we're

1330
00:47:39,719 --> 00:47:43,259
moving to this kind of final scale we're

1331
00:47:41,429 --> 00:47:45,838
saying we want this to be less and less

1332
00:47:43,260 --> 00:47:48,750
constrained by just how much we can walk

1333
00:47:45,838 --> 00:47:50,578
and see in a day and I think you know

1334
00:47:48,750 --> 00:47:53,730
all of these are extremely exciting

1335
00:47:50,579 --> 00:47:55,769
scales to be studied and so with that I

1336
00:47:53,730 --> 00:47:58,079
left I have a lot of things as you can

1337
00:47:55,769 --> 00:47:59,969
see because a lot of people have been it

1338
00:47:58,079 --> 00:48:02,130
could be excellent so Rebecca has been a

1339
00:47:59,969 --> 00:48:04,679
wonderful mentor both encouraging me to

1340
00:48:02,130 --> 00:48:06,240
do more out there things like machine

1341
00:48:04,679 --> 00:48:09,389
learning from film images but also to

1342
00:48:06,239 --> 00:48:10,919
focus and write my papers so both

1343
00:48:09,389 --> 00:48:12,348
keeping me on track and encouraging me

1344
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:14,460
to try new things

1345
00:48:12,349 --> 00:48:16,230
Gillian turgid and Mike Gore it's

1346
00:48:14,460 --> 00:48:18,179
incredibly valuable to have two people

1347
00:48:16,230 --> 00:48:21,750
who have questions on like hardcore

1348
00:48:18,179 --> 00:48:23,669
fungal genetics and meiosis or on you

1349
00:48:21,750 --> 00:48:25,260
know how we shouldn't be processing this

1350
00:48:23,670 --> 00:48:27,780
data flow for high people phenotyping

1351
00:48:25,260 --> 00:48:29,099
that have excellent people to ask the

1352
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:31,019
Nelson lab personnel and staff

1353
00:48:29,099 --> 00:48:32,849
specifically our longtime lab manager

1354
00:48:31,019 --> 00:48:35,929
Judy Copeman who's my compatriot in the

1355
00:48:32,849 --> 00:48:38,130
field for basically all my field seasons

1356
00:48:35,929 --> 00:48:39,210
greenhouse and field personnel anyone

1357
00:48:38,130 --> 00:48:40,710
who works in the greenhouse and field

1358
00:48:39,210 --> 00:48:43,289
knows it they're the ones can make

1359
00:48:40,710 --> 00:48:45,329
everything run the Nelson Lab has a

1360
00:48:43,289 --> 00:48:47,039
wonderful cohort of grad students former

1361
00:48:45,329 --> 00:48:48,930
and current who are always getting

1362
00:48:47,039 --> 00:48:51,480
really excellent advice about everything

1363
00:48:48,929 --> 00:48:53,848
even a nick from the Mike Gore's lab are

1364
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:56,369
the ones who for - acuity and amount of

1365
00:48:53,849 --> 00:48:57,870
effort to get our drone images taken the

1366
00:48:56,369 --> 00:48:59,789
Lipson lab at Columbia's our

1367
00:48:57,869 --> 00:49:02,130
science collaborators have been really

1368
00:48:59,789 --> 00:49:03,719
truthful to work with synapses is a

1369
00:49:02,130 --> 00:49:05,550
wonderful organization and I say that

1370
00:49:03,719 --> 00:49:07,799
not just pandering because most people

1371
00:49:05,550 --> 00:49:09,570
in here a grad students but it's a it's

1372
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:11,280
a great organization to just you know

1373
00:49:09,570 --> 00:49:13,380
have lots of opportunities and outlets

1374
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:15,600
to talk about plant biology obviously

1375
00:49:13,380 --> 00:49:17,369
the love and support and scholarly mind

1376
00:49:15,599 --> 00:49:20,489
of Lauren Bukowski who is flying back

1377
00:49:17,369 --> 00:49:22,469
from Japan right now I think and then

1378
00:49:20,489 --> 00:49:24,689
funding from the NSF national products

1379
00:49:22,469 --> 00:49:27,149
initiative in the past two years the NSF

1380
00:49:24,690 --> 00:49:28,829
Dr Mays grant right here for my first

1381
00:49:27,150 --> 00:49:31,440
three years and the joint genome

1382
00:49:28,829 --> 00:49:33,500
Institute who fun to be a lot of the RNA

1383
00:49:31,440 --> 00:50:08,880
seek work and fungal genome sequencing

1384
00:49:33,500 --> 00:50:10,590
with that yeah probably a lot especially

1385
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:12,720
about the germination success of the

1386
00:50:10,590 --> 00:50:14,910
Canadia I mean so you know so when he

1387
00:50:12,719 --> 00:50:16,859
spray Canadia these asexual spores in

1388
00:50:14,909 --> 00:50:18,599
the leaf for spraying thousands to tens

1389
00:50:16,860 --> 00:50:22,470
of thousands of hundreds of thousands of

1390
00:50:18,599 --> 00:50:24,119
them and we really think from looking at

1391
00:50:22,469 --> 00:50:25,709
the leaves I mean you know it's like not

1392
00:50:24,119 --> 00:50:27,480
many of them succeed into becoming a

1393
00:50:25,710 --> 00:50:29,039
lesion so I think that's probably what

1394
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:31,769
we're missing is the germination success

1395
00:50:29,039 --> 00:50:33,570
of the Canadia I mean I think there's

1396
00:50:31,769 --> 00:50:34,860
lots to miss there and so that's the RTC

1397
00:50:33,570 --> 00:50:36,360
paper that has come out about Esther

1398
00:50:34,860 --> 00:50:38,460
Asuka that we were worried if they'd

1399
00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:39,870
scooped us you know that was really in

1400
00:50:38,460 --> 00:50:41,250
just the first three days that was I

1401
00:50:39,869 --> 00:50:42,710
think their own time point was like one

1402
00:50:41,250 --> 00:51:04,530
day post inoculation

1403
00:50:42,710 --> 00:51:06,809
oh yeah sunny day running dirty

1404
00:51:04,530 --> 00:51:11,230
background and how would that influence

1405
00:51:06,809 --> 00:51:15,009
their CNN I picked the nicest images

1406
00:51:11,230 --> 00:51:16,210
oh yes so the question if I did here is

1407
00:51:15,010 --> 00:51:17,950
about you know these have a dark

1408
00:51:16,210 --> 00:51:19,720
background and then as well so this is

1409
00:51:17,949 --> 00:51:21,279
obviously a Kanaan a cloudy day you've

1410
00:51:19,719 --> 00:51:22,659
got really nice contrast it's taken

1411
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:24,310
earlier in the season where everything's

1412
00:51:22,659 --> 00:51:25,989
dark green still you know that was not

1413
00:51:24,309 --> 00:51:27,489
the question but I think we're all the

1414
00:51:25,989 --> 00:51:28,598
point and you've got this dark

1415
00:51:27,489 --> 00:51:30,989
background all the leaves already pop

1416
00:51:28,599 --> 00:51:34,510
out you know if it's bright and sunny

1417
00:51:30,989 --> 00:51:36,250
you know how does this perform so the we

1418
00:51:34,510 --> 00:51:37,990
have a lot of images that look a lot

1419
00:51:36,250 --> 00:51:39,849
worse than this where the lesions are

1420
00:51:37,989 --> 00:51:41,019
less clear you have images from later in

1421
00:51:39,849 --> 00:51:44,530
the season where you start getting the

1422
00:51:41,019 --> 00:51:46,179
confusing things of you know senescence

1423
00:51:44,530 --> 00:51:49,089
of the lower leaves versus what an

1424
00:51:46,179 --> 00:51:50,858
ovulation is you know we have plenty of

1425
00:51:49,088 --> 00:51:52,630
images where and especially you know you

1426
00:51:50,858 --> 00:51:54,460
can imagine with the leaf you get this

1427
00:51:52,630 --> 00:51:56,050
big sunny reflective patch right where

1428
00:51:54,460 --> 00:52:00,010
the leaf curls over because I've taken

1429
00:51:56,050 --> 00:52:02,349
these images straight down yeah and so

1430
00:52:00,010 --> 00:52:05,849
the the accuracy performance values that

1431
00:52:02,349 --> 00:52:08,650
you saw the 95 and 98 well 95 to 97%

1432
00:52:05,849 --> 00:52:11,410
yeah so those are all using that's using

1433
00:52:08,650 --> 00:52:12,730
both shady images and sunny images it's

1434
00:52:11,409 --> 00:52:14,170
using images from earlier in the season

1435
00:52:12,730 --> 00:52:15,880
where things are still this dark blue

1436
00:52:14,170 --> 00:52:17,470
green see some things later in the

1437
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:19,510
season where things are starting to sub

1438
00:52:17,469 --> 00:52:21,608
s so we took a fair amount of pictures

1439
00:52:19,510 --> 00:52:27,609
over you know time courses and different

1440
00:52:21,608 --> 00:52:29,469
conditions good questions questions when

1441
00:52:27,608 --> 00:52:34,929
you're sampling your gene expression

1442
00:52:29,469 --> 00:52:38,608
d-10 tissue are you interaction a lot of

1443
00:52:34,929 --> 00:52:41,289
it's presumably going to be yes so the

1444
00:52:38,608 --> 00:52:43,750
sampling was done basically around the

1445
00:52:41,289 --> 00:52:47,679
lesion for 10 days post inoculation with

1446
00:52:43,750 --> 00:52:48,849
these what you generally see well I'll

1447
00:52:47,679 --> 00:52:49,989
take a while for me to scroll back but

1448
00:52:48,849 --> 00:52:53,250
we generally see at 10 days in the

1449
00:52:49,989 --> 00:52:55,358
growth chamber with these backgrounds is

1450
00:52:53,250 --> 00:52:58,719
you know the lesions are starting to

1451
00:52:55,358 --> 00:53:00,940
form but it's not totally so as PDF so

1452
00:52:58,719 --> 00:53:04,078
it's not totally crusty like this it

1453
00:53:00,940 --> 00:53:14,019
looks more similar to this HT 2 here so

1454
00:53:04,079 --> 00:53:15,310
this would be yeah so we've done

1455
00:53:14,019 --> 00:53:17,349
different things so the sampling for

1456
00:53:15,309 --> 00:53:19,509
this experiment was done by Santiago

1457
00:53:17,349 --> 00:53:21,250
Medeiros mostly from our lab before he

1458
00:53:19,510 --> 00:53:23,410
moved under postdoc and then I've been

1459
00:53:21,250 --> 00:53:24,760
sending another grown the one with QT

1460
00:53:23,409 --> 00:53:26,108
ELISA Lyons

1461
00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:27,670
we tossed around a lot of different

1462
00:53:26,108 --> 00:53:30,940
ideas to basically minimize sample

1463
00:53:27,670 --> 00:53:32,409
variance and for that experiment what I

1464
00:53:30,940 --> 00:53:35,380
ultimately settled on was basically

1465
00:53:32,409 --> 00:53:37,269
taking a big swath the same size as what

1466
00:53:35,380 --> 00:53:39,369
we were sampling for histopathology so

1467
00:53:37,269 --> 00:53:42,670
you're averaging out a fair amount of

1468
00:53:39,369 --> 00:53:44,530
area around around where the lesions

1469
00:53:42,670 --> 00:53:46,599
incipient but also so we inoculate with

1470
00:53:44,530 --> 00:53:48,849
the walls and so you get most of our

1471
00:53:46,599 --> 00:53:50,019
spores in a pretty obvious band so

1472
00:53:48,849 --> 00:53:51,550
basically most that most of the

1473
00:53:50,019 --> 00:53:52,719
infection in the growth chamber when we

1474
00:53:51,550 --> 00:54:01,150
were all not good is happening within

1475
00:53:52,719 --> 00:54:02,889
about two inches my impression is and a

1476
00:54:01,150 --> 00:54:09,039
lot of these humming by a trophic

1477
00:54:02,889 --> 00:54:11,889
interactions like 48-hour yeah so that's

1478
00:54:09,039 --> 00:54:16,570
another is this such a different kind of

1479
00:54:11,889 --> 00:54:19,118
interaction I mean yes I think it I mean

1480
00:54:16,570 --> 00:54:21,519
so the majority is on weak pathogens and

1481
00:54:19,119 --> 00:54:22,240
magnet for thin rice like what we had to

1482
00:54:21,519 --> 00:54:25,389
compare this to

1483
00:54:22,239 --> 00:54:26,529
and then as well so we've also been you

1484
00:54:25,389 --> 00:54:27,699
know a collaborator people on cardi

1485
00:54:26,530 --> 00:54:29,560
works in southern leaf bite which is

1486
00:54:27,699 --> 00:54:32,409
called a Hemi betrothed but that by

1487
00:54:29,559 --> 00:54:35,949
atrophic phase lasts like 12 hours so

1488
00:54:32,409 --> 00:54:38,049
then as a question of is it quiescent in

1489
00:54:35,949 --> 00:54:39,909
general this is fairly similar to what's

1490
00:54:38,050 --> 00:54:41,769
been observed in Magna Bertha where she

1491
00:54:39,909 --> 00:54:43,358
was pretty rich I don't have a good

1492
00:54:41,769 --> 00:54:47,309
answer for in terms of how the Hayes

1493
00:54:43,358 --> 00:54:47,309
relative to the wheat penny by drops

1494
00:54:57,690 --> 00:55:02,559
this is one thing that we oh yeah so the

1495
00:55:01,510 --> 00:55:03,730
question was have we've been able to

1496
00:55:02,559 --> 00:55:05,469
test the accuracy with regards to

1497
00:55:03,730 --> 00:55:07,389
different these plates so there was one

1498
00:55:05,469 --> 00:55:09,818
thing we really wanted to do with the

1499
00:55:07,389 --> 00:55:11,019
outside of the grant and basically we're

1500
00:55:09,818 --> 00:55:13,059
not able to do because there's so many

1501
00:55:11,019 --> 00:55:15,489
complications to the earlier steps but

1502
00:55:13,059 --> 00:55:16,838
yeah so I mean northern leaf plate and

1503
00:55:15,489 --> 00:55:19,719
say and frack you'll see fight they look

1504
00:55:16,838 --> 00:55:21,400
really similar I mean like when you've

1505
00:55:19,719 --> 00:55:22,809
seen them a lot you can like okay I can

1506
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:26,349
tell some diagnostic things but they

1507
00:55:22,809 --> 00:55:28,000
look really really similar so I think

1508
00:55:26,349 --> 00:55:31,170
yeah that's a that's the obvious you

1509
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:31,170
know a next question to ask

1510
00:55:32,829 --> 00:55:40,670
