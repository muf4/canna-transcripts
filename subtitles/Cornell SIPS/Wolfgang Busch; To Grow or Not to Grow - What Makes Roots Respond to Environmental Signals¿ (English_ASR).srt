1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:05,200
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,569 --> 00:00:05,199
University

3
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:13,309
so so it's great to be here and

4
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:15,530
beautiful Ataka it's my first time at

5
00:00:13,308 --> 00:00:18,439
the cornell so I'm very impressed and

6
00:00:15,529 --> 00:00:21,049
I'd like to tell you about the research

7
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:23,510
that you know I started in my lab in

8
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:27,109
Vienna and now I am continuing at the

9
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:29,960
sock which is essentially revolving

10
00:00:27,109 --> 00:00:32,270
around the question why do roots grow

11
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:36,530
and how do they decide to stop to grow

12
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:38,060
or continue to grow and the reason why I

13
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:41,000
think it's very interesting and

14
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:43,609
important to study roots is because why

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,890
are we typically every day we see the

16
00:00:43,609 --> 00:00:49,340
shoots of fans and we think they are so

17
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:52,159
important to you know fix co2 and and

18
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:56,270
make air with the help of sunlight into

19
00:00:52,159 --> 00:00:58,099
into matter into biomaterials you know

20
00:00:56,270 --> 00:01:01,850
without roots they can't do this right

21
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:04,010
so roots they mined the soil they take

22
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:06,019
up the water they need to search for

23
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:10,689
water and nutrients and provide that to

24
00:01:06,019 --> 00:01:14,289
the chute and so they are a huge part

25
00:01:10,688 --> 00:01:17,959
determining plant productivity and

26
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:20,868
interestingly enough chute root

27
00:01:17,959 --> 00:01:23,030
architecture is very as dramatic or even

28
00:01:20,868 --> 00:01:24,950
more dramatic if you compare them to

29
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:27,228
shoot architecture that we see every day

30
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:30,710
so this is a beautiful drawing from

31
00:01:27,228 --> 00:01:33,890
Weaver on prairie plants and you can see

32
00:01:30,709 --> 00:01:36,259
that actually there is that that there

33
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:38,810
really it's easy to this thing where

34
00:01:36,259 --> 00:01:40,280
species according to their root system

35
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:42,290
architecture you have species that

36
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:44,210
basically grow very deep and you have

37
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:46,280
species that form very shell root

38
00:01:44,209 --> 00:01:48,559
systems that explore the upper so

39
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:50,180
there's much much better and and a big

40
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,609
question is what what actually

41
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:54,710
determines these differences and and not

42
00:01:52,609 --> 00:01:56,810
only are these differences visible

43
00:01:54,709 --> 00:01:59,989
between different species they are also

44
00:01:56,810 --> 00:02:01,700
visible within one species and and so so

45
00:01:59,989 --> 00:02:04,699
the work that I will tell you about

46
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:07,430
today is done in this tiny model species

47
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:09,289
are obsessed Aliannah and we use this

48
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:11,780
because there are so many tools

49
00:02:09,288 --> 00:02:13,729
available for this but we can study the

50
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:16,479
processes that matter in the in the in

51
00:02:13,729 --> 00:02:19,280
the larger picture of evolution also

52
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:21,318
within this single species

53
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:24,590
because different strains of these

54
00:02:21,318 --> 00:02:27,469
species display very different route

55
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:29,479
phenotypes so so so we have natural

56
00:02:27,469 --> 00:02:31,879
variation already within the first two

57
00:02:29,479 --> 00:02:34,489
weeks of root development that you can

58
00:02:31,879 --> 00:02:37,340
see here just seedlings of five

59
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:39,560
different strains accessions we call

60
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:41,959
them grown on agar plates and you can

61
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:44,000
see that there are accessions that grow

62
00:02:41,959 --> 00:02:46,189
very slowly and accessions that grow

63
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,199
much faster accessions that grow that

64
00:02:46,189 --> 00:02:51,409
put out way more lateral roots and

65
00:02:48,199 --> 00:02:54,679
accessions that put put out less lateral

66
00:02:51,409 --> 00:02:56,780
roots and and and using like this model

67
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:59,030
species net natural variation within it

68
00:02:56,780 --> 00:03:01,310
we can actually try to identify the

69
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:02,419
genes and the variants of those genes

70
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:04,610
that actually determine those

71
00:03:02,419 --> 00:03:07,729
differences and that will tell us how

72
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:09,920
actually roots you know grow are

73
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:12,409
basically genetically programmed to grow

74
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:14,988
or to in a certain direction to a

75
00:03:12,409 --> 00:03:19,370
certain depth or stop to grow in

76
00:03:14,989 --> 00:03:21,230
response to certain signals so I was

77
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:24,110
just alluding to the signals that make

78
00:03:21,229 --> 00:03:26,509
roots grow or stop to grow this can be

79
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:28,549
nicely seen here also you know just a

80
00:03:26,509 --> 00:03:31,209
five day very early time course is

81
00:03:28,549 --> 00:03:32,629
enough to 2z that's very very very very

82
00:03:31,209 --> 00:03:36,319
very clearly

83
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:38,719
so this those this is the same accession

84
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:40,729
because Arab topsis is a cell for those

85
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:42,919
are all isogenic plant which so we are

86
00:03:40,729 --> 00:03:46,069
seeing here responses of the same genome

87
00:03:42,919 --> 00:03:48,349
two different growth conditions where we

88
00:03:46,069 --> 00:03:50,289
either remove the iron from the medium

89
00:03:48,349 --> 00:03:53,299
or the phosphor or the sulfur or we

90
00:03:50,289 --> 00:03:55,989
reduce the pH and you can see that the

91
00:03:53,299 --> 00:03:59,150
same genome actually responds very

92
00:03:55,989 --> 00:04:02,689
stereotypically to those environmental

93
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:05,359
changes for instance in iron deficiency

94
00:04:02,689 --> 00:04:07,310
this accession stops to grow very early

95
00:04:05,359 --> 00:04:09,829
on and then there's some hypo quartile

96
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:11,780
elongation even and then under and the

97
00:04:09,829 --> 00:04:14,480
phosphate deficiency the same accessions

98
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:18,288
actually grows basically a little bit

99
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:20,089
faster than under full medium so so we

100
00:04:18,288 --> 00:04:23,209
can see that we can study both the

101
00:04:20,089 --> 00:04:25,459
genotypic you know a Kinsella tea for

102
00:04:23,209 --> 00:04:28,629
different group or for root growth but

103
00:04:25,459 --> 00:04:30,779
as well look at the responses of

104
00:04:28,629 --> 00:04:36,870
genotypes and enough

105
00:04:30,779 --> 00:04:39,809
sessions two and two to map the genes

106
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:42,030
and and identify the mechanisms that are

107
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:45,418
responsible to this and maybe even to

108
00:04:42,029 --> 00:04:47,699
learn how this relates to adaptation we

109
00:04:45,418 --> 00:04:50,009
make use of a resource that has been

110
00:04:47,699 --> 00:04:52,769
built by air adopters researchers over

111
00:04:50,009 --> 00:04:54,810
many decades starting in the studies of

112
00:04:52,769 --> 00:04:57,240
the of the last century when people

113
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:59,399
started to collect Arab doctors all over

114
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:01,470
the world so this is a supporter

115
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:03,599
projection of the mainly the Northern

116
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:06,180
Hemisphere and every dot here

117
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:08,580
corresponds to one strain of every

118
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:10,470
DOCSIS that has been collected at some

119
00:05:08,579 --> 00:05:12,418
point in time and you can see that

120
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:14,280
actually actually every DOCSIS grows is

121
00:05:12,418 --> 00:05:17,579
a weed that grows kind of everywhere

122
00:05:14,279 --> 00:05:20,189
goes from northern Sweden to southern

123
00:05:17,579 --> 00:05:23,250
Spain even northern Africa grows from

124
00:05:20,189 --> 00:05:25,168
the Atlantic coast into a central asia

125
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:27,120
and we know that there are even chinese

126
00:05:25,168 --> 00:05:29,879
accessions so basically every doctor's

127
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:32,939
has expanded like all over Eurasia and

128
00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:35,879
was introduced later on to to the

129
00:05:32,939 --> 00:05:37,949
Americas and so so so all these strains

130
00:05:35,879 --> 00:05:40,019
are available in stock centers we know

131
00:05:37,949 --> 00:05:41,819
where they came from and many of these

132
00:05:40,019 --> 00:05:44,459
strains have been a genotype with

133
00:05:41,819 --> 00:05:46,589
high-resolution snip chips or even

134
00:05:44,459 --> 00:05:48,629
resequenced completely so we can

135
00:05:46,589 --> 00:05:51,119
actually start to draw the genotype to

136
00:05:48,629 --> 00:05:53,219
phenotype maps and we can ask you know

137
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,720
are some some alleles actually

138
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:56,370
distributed in a manner that we can

139
00:05:54,720 --> 00:06:00,900
understand how that relates to

140
00:05:56,370 --> 00:06:03,300
adaptation so how do we do this we use a

141
00:06:00,899 --> 00:06:05,429
method called genomes genome-wide

142
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:07,620
Association mapping I just briefly

143
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:09,900
outline how this works the principle is

144
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:11,699
very simple the statistics behind it a

145
00:06:09,899 --> 00:06:14,879
little more complicated but it's not

146
00:06:11,699 --> 00:06:16,949
necessary to understand this in detail

147
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:18,719
right now but the principle is we

148
00:06:16,949 --> 00:06:20,459
measure a lot of phenotype let's say in

149
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:23,669
short route like the length of the route

150
00:06:20,459 --> 00:06:26,038
we quantify this accurately we take the

151
00:06:23,668 --> 00:06:29,219
genome sequence or the genotype data and

152
00:06:26,038 --> 00:06:31,500
then we try to correlate the difference

153
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:33,360
of the variation in the route lengths

154
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:36,930
between different exceptions to the

155
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:39,419
variation in the genome sequence so we

156
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:42,709
do this all over the five chromosomes of

157
00:06:39,418 --> 00:06:43,979
Arabidopsis and and basically for every

158
00:06:42,709 --> 00:06:47,759
polymorphism that

159
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:50,250
fine we can ask do accessions that have

160
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:52,289
a long road have a different nucleotide

161
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:53,639
at that position then accessions as

162
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:55,439
compared to accessions to the short

163
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:57,899
route right if all the accessions that

164
00:06:55,439 --> 00:07:00,240
long would have an a at this position in

165
00:06:57,899 --> 00:07:02,370
all of the accessions with a short would

166
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:04,650
have a G this will be a very high

167
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:06,750
correlation very high association and

168
00:07:04,649 --> 00:07:09,659
then we can basically plot the

169
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:11,730
probability for this association are

170
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:13,980
like over the whole genome and we were

171
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:16,470
looking for Peaks where this probability

172
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:18,870
is so it's a it's a leg of the negative

173
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:20,940
logarithm of the p-value is very high so

174
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:26,220
that's essentially the plots you will

175
00:07:20,939 --> 00:07:29,459
see today so when I started my lab six

176
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:31,080
years ago it was actually very simple

177
00:07:29,459 --> 00:07:32,789
this part was actually getting very

178
00:07:31,079 --> 00:07:34,649
simple because there were lots of labs

179
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:37,140
who loved to sequence ever drops of

180
00:07:34,649 --> 00:07:39,029
strains so you know the labs of Detlef

181
00:07:37,139 --> 00:07:41,399
Vigo Magnus North Bergen Joe Ecker

182
00:07:39,029 --> 00:07:42,919
they you know started sequencing more

183
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:45,029
than a thousand extensions and

184
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:47,280
genotyping efforts have been on the way

185
00:07:45,029 --> 00:07:49,500
so so we could just like download this

186
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:51,959
part so that problem was solved but was

187
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:53,879
not solved in the end the association

188
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:56,579
mapping problem was largely solved as

189
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:58,709
well by by efforts from Magnus North

190
00:07:56,579 --> 00:08:00,329
Works and there was like lots of I mean

191
00:07:58,709 --> 00:08:02,609
of course there's lots of activity in

192
00:08:00,329 --> 00:08:04,859
human genetics to do the same thing and

193
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:07,050
so so the so the methods were actually

194
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:09,949
well outlined the problem actually is or

195
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:12,120
was the phenotype in so how to measure

196
00:08:09,949 --> 00:08:14,759
thousands hundred thousands of roots

197
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:17,910
without making credit students jump out

198
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:20,730
of the window and pure you know because

199
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:22,650
it's like so horribly boring right and

200
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:24,710
so so what we developed was then like

201
00:08:22,649 --> 00:08:28,979
multiple ways to actually measure

202
00:08:24,709 --> 00:08:31,949
phenotypes as much as possible in an

203
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:33,539
automated way so so the main pipeline

204
00:08:31,949 --> 00:08:36,598
and that is all the data that I'll talk

205
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:39,598
today is based on this so we grow 24

206
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:41,340
seedlings on a plate and then we image

207
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:44,970
them very efficiently using a scanner

208
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:46,030
cluster so we can acquire 300 plans

209
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:48,370
within

210
00:08:46,029 --> 00:08:50,319
minutes and then we have written

211
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:52,860
algorithms that actually transform this

212
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:55,660
image and image like this into data

213
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:57,310
which is outlined here so this these are

214
00:08:55,659 --> 00:08:59,259
virtual representations of those

215
00:08:57,309 --> 00:09:01,269
seedlings and and because this is all

216
00:08:59,259 --> 00:09:03,939
you know data we can we can basically

217
00:09:01,269 --> 00:09:06,639
measure everything starting from the

218
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:09,970
root length to the to the angle at which

219
00:09:06,639 --> 00:09:12,309
roots grow and to the shape of roots and

220
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:14,110
so on using this pipeline and and there

221
00:09:12,309 --> 00:09:17,399
is no human intervention needed for this

222
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:20,350
step because those things work largely

223
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:23,649
automatically so with this pipeline we

224
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:26,050
we I think we we have quantified I think

225
00:09:23,649 --> 00:09:27,490
almost like three million individual

226
00:09:26,049 --> 00:09:29,500
images of seedlings and different

227
00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:31,090
conditions from very different genotypes

228
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:33,039
and that works very very nicely for the

229
00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:35,259
first couple of days for root

230
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:37,629
development to quantify accurately and

231
00:09:35,259 --> 00:09:41,409
with very high at a very high scale

232
00:09:37,629 --> 00:09:43,149
alight large scale phenotypes and then

233
00:09:41,409 --> 00:09:44,949
we also but I won't talk about this

234
00:09:43,149 --> 00:09:47,559
today we also automated confocal

235
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:51,129
microscopy that we could actually get

236
00:09:47,559 --> 00:09:53,139
nice confocal images 3d stacks of images

237
00:09:51,129 --> 00:09:55,750
where we can actually measure cell size

238
00:09:53,139 --> 00:09:57,220
and and and things like meristem size to

239
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:59,799
determine what is the area in which

240
00:09:57,220 --> 00:10:02,680
cells divide and we could also

241
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:05,740
successfully use this to map regulators

242
00:10:02,679 --> 00:10:08,769
of cell size and meristem size and where

243
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:10,750
genetic variation is cause so for

244
00:10:08,769 --> 00:10:14,100
differences of cell size and meristem

245
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:19,110
size ok so today I'm gonna talk about

246
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:22,149
two projects mainly one two and a half

247
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:24,129
where we that illustrate I think nicely

248
00:10:22,149 --> 00:10:26,590
what we can do and what types of

249
00:10:24,129 --> 00:10:29,289
questions we can understand using

250
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:31,420
natural variation in our tools and this

251
00:10:29,289 --> 00:10:35,620
all basically got started with this

252
00:10:31,419 --> 00:10:36,339
experiment where we used 200 around 250

253
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:39,129
accessions

254
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:41,680
and exposed them to different conditions

255
00:10:39,129 --> 00:10:44,409
so we just grew them on agar plates like

256
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:46,769
depicted us here so those are is one

257
00:10:44,409 --> 00:10:49,419
accession grown in three replicates

258
00:10:46,769 --> 00:10:52,299
where I show three replicates for each

259
00:10:49,419 --> 00:10:54,250
condition and you can see that as I

260
00:10:52,299 --> 00:10:54,929
showed in the movie before that in

261
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:57,129
different

262
00:10:54,929 --> 00:10:58,899
conditions when we drop our different

263
00:10:57,129 --> 00:11:01,659
nutrients we actually get a very

264
00:10:58,899 --> 00:11:05,049
different route response and so we did

265
00:11:01,659 --> 00:11:07,509
this for each of those 200 around 250

266
00:11:05,049 --> 00:11:10,059
accessions and we then can encode traits

267
00:11:07,509 --> 00:11:13,000
and colors so here we encode growth rate

268
00:11:10,059 --> 00:11:14,979
so a yellow color means that there's

269
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,559
high growth rate a blue color means a

270
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:20,800
low growth rate and each of those rows

271
00:11:17,559 --> 00:11:22,089
here corresponds to one accession so

272
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:25,149
basically here you can see different

273
00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:26,740
patterns of growth responses you can see

274
00:11:25,149 --> 00:11:28,840
that there are conditions like iron

275
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:30,669
deficiency where you know most of the

276
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:33,519
accessions do basically the same thing

277
00:11:30,669 --> 00:11:36,490
they start to grow some of them stop

278
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:39,279
earlier so the blue that already get

279
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:41,919
blue on day one some of them stop later

280
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:44,980
so basically continue to grow despite

281
00:11:41,919 --> 00:11:47,349
this deprivation of iron but then there

282
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:49,240
are some conditions where basically some

283
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:50,670
accession spacing increase their growth

284
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:53,350
on day four for instance in some

285
00:11:50,669 --> 00:11:55,479
accessions decrease their growth so you

286
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:58,779
can see this this response to the

287
00:11:55,480 --> 00:12:01,779
environment is is really dependent on

288
00:11:58,779 --> 00:12:04,389
the genotype and because especially

289
00:12:01,779 --> 00:12:06,370
micronutrients like like iron will be in

290
00:12:04,389 --> 00:12:08,559
sufficient quantity already in the seed

291
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:10,539
this is most likely not dependent on

292
00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:12,639
like accessions running out of a

293
00:12:10,539 --> 00:12:16,000
nutrient but rather an active response

294
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:17,889
to the information to somehow a sensing

295
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,960
process that tells them there's less or

296
00:12:17,889 --> 00:12:24,189
there's basically less of this nutrient

297
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:27,730
around so you can see that in in this

298
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:30,190
nice movie where for iron deficiency you

299
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:32,800
can visualize very nicely this different

300
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:35,620
response so those are two exceptions

301
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:38,309
that that grow the same way under for in

302
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:41,169
the full medium but this accession grows

303
00:12:38,309 --> 00:12:42,909
like busy stops that grows very early on

304
00:12:41,169 --> 00:12:44,409
and then somehow prioritize the

305
00:12:42,909 --> 00:12:46,480
hypertonic quarter grows a little bit

306
00:12:44,409 --> 00:12:48,279
more in this succession continues to

307
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:51,460
grow to a later time point under this

308
00:12:48,279 --> 00:12:54,100
right so we can use this to then

309
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:55,840
quantify this and then ask what is

310
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:59,680
actually what are the genetic variants

311
00:12:55,840 --> 00:13:02,440
that are causing this difference so the

312
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:06,609
first you know project that we started

313
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:07,430
we started to phenotype 138 sweeter

314
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:09,830
success

315
00:13:07,429 --> 00:13:11,989
34 Swedish accessions from this region

316
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:13,910
those have been collected by Magnus not

317
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:16,370
work and Sweden is actually very

318
00:13:13,909 --> 00:13:18,169
interesting it is actually very

319
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:21,169
interesting collection because within

320
00:13:18,169 --> 00:13:22,939
Sweden even if if you think a whole

321
00:13:21,169 --> 00:13:25,069
Sweden is called there are differences

322
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:27,050
in climate and northern Sweden is way

323
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:28,940
colder than southern Sweden and there

324
00:13:27,049 --> 00:13:32,509
are also differences in soil types and

325
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:35,209
so on plus it is a local population so

326
00:13:32,509 --> 00:13:37,639
mostly the same alleles will will be

327
00:13:35,208 --> 00:13:40,789
present in this in this population and

328
00:13:37,639 --> 00:13:42,679
and and and it's it's easier to make map

329
00:13:40,789 --> 00:13:44,208
comment variation for this at least

330
00:13:42,679 --> 00:13:45,199
that's what we that's what we thought

331
00:13:44,208 --> 00:13:48,649
and I think that's actually what we

332
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:52,009
found ok so just to demonstrate you so

333
00:13:48,649 --> 00:13:54,049
when we did iron-like growth on iron

334
00:13:52,009 --> 00:13:55,819
medium so you can find everything like

335
00:13:54,049 --> 00:13:57,949
all almost always those natural

336
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:59,660
variation some of the exceptions they

337
00:13:57,950 --> 00:14:02,060
actually stopped very early their growth

338
00:13:59,659 --> 00:14:04,129
some of them stopped late and basically

339
00:14:02,059 --> 00:14:05,899
elongated longer and then when we map

340
00:14:04,129 --> 00:14:07,879
this we found this one peak on

341
00:14:05,899 --> 00:14:10,970
chromosome 1 that was above our

342
00:14:07,879 --> 00:14:13,879
significance threshold that was very

343
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:16,759
significant so when we then zoomed in so

344
00:14:13,879 --> 00:14:20,088
we in this in this region it was in a

345
00:14:16,759 --> 00:14:25,610
region the snip was in the region of pro

346
00:14:20,089 --> 00:14:28,279
2 which is a major regulator of iron

347
00:14:25,610 --> 00:14:31,940
homeostasis so so this is from from a

348
00:14:28,278 --> 00:14:35,539
review where you can see the enzymatic

349
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:39,380
activity of Afro 2 where where it

350
00:14:35,539 --> 00:14:44,088
basically does this catalyzes this

351
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:46,549
reaction from iron and to iron 2 plus

352
00:14:44,089 --> 00:14:49,220
which then can be transported within

353
00:14:46,549 --> 00:14:51,528
into the cell and that function has been

354
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:53,120
known already a long time and made it a

355
00:14:51,528 --> 00:14:55,549
prime candidate to space on its

356
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:58,399
annotation so usually we don't like to

357
00:14:55,549 --> 00:15:00,469
use annotation for prioritizing

358
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:03,019
candidate genes because there's always

359
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:06,050
the danger that you kind of wag your own

360
00:15:03,019 --> 00:15:07,669
tail that you kind of think something

361
00:15:06,049 --> 00:15:09,319
plays a role and then when you look at

362
00:15:07,669 --> 00:15:11,088
the knockout mutant of course most

363
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:14,690
likely will play a role so we always

364
00:15:11,089 --> 00:15:17,500
typically take additional independent

365
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:19,720
data to assign more confidence to Canada

366
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:21,639
magine before we go on a more

367
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:26,529
time-consuming you know genetic

368
00:15:21,639 --> 00:15:28,870
characterization of this so in in terms

369
00:15:26,529 --> 00:15:30,579
of this we actually looked at the

370
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:31,899
expression level of row two in those

371
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:34,600
different exceptions I don't show the

372
00:15:31,899 --> 00:15:36,220
data here but 402 was in what basically

373
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:38,259
expression was increased in the

374
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:39,850
exceptions with a long route as opposed

375
00:15:38,259 --> 00:15:41,409
to the ones for the short route so there

376
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:44,170
was additional evidence for this of

377
00:15:41,409 --> 00:15:46,029
course the final test that you can do is

378
00:15:44,169 --> 00:15:48,490
to take the alleles from those

379
00:15:46,029 --> 00:15:49,929
exceptions and put them in the mutant

380
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:54,129
background if the mutant background

381
00:15:49,929 --> 00:15:56,229
shows a phenotype and so so indeed fro

382
00:15:54,129 --> 00:15:58,689
to actually under low iron conditions

383
00:15:56,230 --> 00:16:01,629
that shows a shorter route and so what

384
00:15:58,690 --> 00:16:04,390
we did is we took the allele the fro two

385
00:16:01,629 --> 00:16:06,610
allele from this short rooted accession

386
00:16:04,389 --> 00:16:07,720
we took the early from this long road

387
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:11,320
and accession in an intermediate

388
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:15,360
accession and we we put it back into the

389
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:17,410
mutant background and in order to

390
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:19,120
because it's a very tricky business

391
00:16:17,409 --> 00:16:21,459
because we're dealing with expression

392
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:24,279
level differences because we don't want

393
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:26,139
to be susceptible to two random

394
00:16:24,279 --> 00:16:28,449
insertion expression events you can

395
00:16:26,139 --> 00:16:30,250
imagine that transgenes can insert in

396
00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:31,690
different areas of the genome and that

397
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:34,779
might by chance

398
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:36,100
basically just confer a higher

399
00:16:34,779 --> 00:16:38,079
expression level or lower expression

400
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:41,139
level because that can be position

401
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:44,139
dependent we we do a lot of T 1

402
00:16:41,139 --> 00:16:46,480
independent insertions and a phenotype

403
00:16:44,139 --> 00:16:49,960
in T 1 based on an honor on a

404
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:51,580
fluorescent marker system selection so

405
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:54,310
to be sure that we can actually average

406
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:58,060
out position specific insertion events

407
00:16:54,309 --> 00:17:01,329
and then when we did this we actually

408
00:16:58,059 --> 00:17:04,299
see that under iron deficiency the the

409
00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:06,930
the route length was complemented much

410
00:17:04,299 --> 00:17:09,309
much better so this is the the mutant

411
00:17:06,930 --> 00:17:11,730
canola transformed with the empty vector

412
00:17:09,309 --> 00:17:15,548
in in

413
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:18,068
transgenic lines that were complemented

414
00:17:15,548 --> 00:17:20,619
with this long route fro to allele why

415
00:17:18,068 --> 00:17:23,259
when we complemented with this short

416
00:17:20,619 --> 00:17:25,509
route fro - ma allele it didn't

417
00:17:23,259 --> 00:17:28,658
compliment at all and most likely

418
00:17:25,509 --> 00:17:30,490
because fro - is in in those exceptions

419
00:17:28,659 --> 00:17:34,240
not expressed at this at that point of

420
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:35,890
time okay so so that made us confident

421
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:38,140
to say actually variation natural

422
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:39,788
allelic variation for fro - is causal

423
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:41,860
for this and it's just another example

424
00:17:39,788 --> 00:17:44,798
where we actually can go from the

425
00:17:41,859 --> 00:17:47,099
phenotype to the gene with genome-wide

426
00:17:44,798 --> 00:17:51,788
Association mapping very efficiently and

427
00:17:47,099 --> 00:17:54,219
so so why is this so the polymorphisms

428
00:17:51,788 --> 00:17:56,500
between those two alleles are non-coding

429
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:58,960
in nature so there is no change of the

430
00:17:56,500 --> 00:18:02,589
of the of the amino acid sequence of the

431
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:04,450
protein there are a couple of changes in

432
00:18:02,589 --> 00:18:06,220
the coding sequence that don't lead to

433
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:09,548
an amino acid change and there are also

434
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:11,860
some snips in the regulatory region so

435
00:18:09,548 --> 00:18:15,609
this is all non-coding non-coding

436
00:18:11,859 --> 00:18:17,500
regulatory and and consistently with

437
00:18:15,609 --> 00:18:19,538
this when we measure in the lines that

438
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:23,589
actually complement a mentor to a better

439
00:18:19,538 --> 00:18:27,158
extend the expression it is much higher

440
00:18:23,589 --> 00:18:30,099
compared to the the short route allele

441
00:18:27,159 --> 00:18:31,870
of row 2 and this is also completely non

442
00:18:30,099 --> 00:18:34,269
surprisingly true for the enzymatic

443
00:18:31,869 --> 00:18:36,699
activity so this higher RNA expression

444
00:18:34,269 --> 00:18:38,859
of row two translates in a higher

445
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:41,649
activity of the enzyme that we can

446
00:18:38,859 --> 00:18:43,990
measure in this in this essay so so we

447
00:18:41,648 --> 00:18:46,449
can really like going from from the

448
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:48,609
genetic variation over the expression to

449
00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:52,090
the enzyme activity we can make the case

450
00:18:48,609 --> 00:18:54,490
that this is more cause is core so

451
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:57,788
another interesting thing was when we

452
00:18:54,490 --> 00:19:00,130
thinking of natural variation that that

453
00:18:57,788 --> 00:19:02,859
we see you know common natural variation

454
00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:05,528
populations it will be most likely

455
00:19:02,859 --> 00:19:07,928
related to adaptation but of course like

456
00:19:05,528 --> 00:19:10,000
growing on agar plates in the first

457
00:19:07,929 --> 00:19:12,720
couple of days and growing a little bit

458
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,769
longer it doesn't tell us so much about

459
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:17,048
effects that relate to fitness

460
00:19:14,769 --> 00:19:20,440
so we basically did the test that we

461
00:19:17,048 --> 00:19:21,058
grew these complemented lines under

462
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:24,048
alkyl

463
00:19:21,058 --> 00:19:28,440
pH where iron availability is actually

464
00:19:24,048 --> 00:19:31,019
reduced and we can see that the the

465
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:32,580
allele of the fro - from the lines with

466
00:19:31,019 --> 00:19:38,190
the longer roots is actually much better

467
00:19:32,579 --> 00:19:40,319
in in in in dealing with this then then

468
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:41,999
then the allele from the line of with

469
00:19:40,319 --> 00:19:45,210
the shorter roots so we think that

470
00:19:41,999 --> 00:19:48,480
somehow gives the plans and advantage to

471
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:51,329
grow in iron limited environments so

472
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:52,649
does it matter when we look at the when

473
00:19:51,329 --> 00:19:54,569
we look at the places where the

474
00:19:52,648 --> 00:19:58,138
accessions come from so this is a map of

475
00:19:54,569 --> 00:20:00,528
sweden and this is the soil type that is

476
00:19:58,138 --> 00:20:03,508
indicated by the colors and you see that

477
00:20:00,528 --> 00:20:05,609
when we look at the - fro alleles one of

478
00:20:03,509 --> 00:20:07,889
you is the a allele pictured in black

479
00:20:05,609 --> 00:20:11,278
the other leaders the G allele pictured

480
00:20:07,888 --> 00:20:13,439
in in in green we can see that most of

481
00:20:11,278 --> 00:20:15,388
the the black allele is actually in the

482
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:18,509
north of Sweden where there are pots

483
00:20:15,388 --> 00:20:20,579
oils which which is a specific type of

484
00:20:18,509 --> 00:20:22,730
soil that's highly acidic and where Iran

485
00:20:20,579 --> 00:20:25,230
for instance gets washed out very fast

486
00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:27,599
while the other allele is predominantly

487
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:30,778
in the other soil types in the south so

488
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:33,269
so that could give an indication that

489
00:20:30,778 --> 00:20:34,859
actually the different alleles might be

490
00:20:33,269 --> 00:20:38,730
at a patient's to different soil types

491
00:20:34,859 --> 00:20:41,368
now this is not not not a like complete

492
00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:43,440
evidence because it is very different

493
00:20:41,368 --> 00:20:47,428
difficult to separate population

494
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:49,798
structure so that means those guys are

495
00:20:47,429 --> 00:20:52,019
way more related among each other than

496
00:20:49,798 --> 00:20:54,329
those guys from from adaptive features

497
00:20:52,019 --> 00:20:56,628
so to really test this we will need to

498
00:20:54,329 --> 00:20:58,829
go to sweden and and to reciprocal

499
00:20:56,628 --> 00:21:00,868
transplants and and we haven't we

500
00:20:58,829 --> 00:21:02,398
haven't done this yet but it's a hint so

501
00:21:00,868 --> 00:21:04,499
it's an hypothesis that this might

502
00:21:02,398 --> 00:21:06,658
actually be one of the one pro to alia

503
00:21:04,499 --> 00:21:11,069
might be an adaptation might be

504
00:21:06,659 --> 00:21:13,619
beneficial in pot salt okay so that's

505
00:21:11,069 --> 00:21:16,259
one of one of these these stories and

506
00:21:13,618 --> 00:21:18,868
these projects will be identified one

507
00:21:16,259 --> 00:21:21,389
gene and in variants of the gene that is

508
00:21:18,868 --> 00:21:23,099
responsible for a certain trait and for

509
00:21:21,388 --> 00:21:25,138
a certain response and we have a couple

510
00:21:23,099 --> 00:21:28,349
of those in the lab and it's very very

511
00:21:25,138 --> 00:21:32,038
interesting but of course but of course

512
00:21:28,349 --> 00:21:32,629
kind of something that we know from you

513
00:21:32,038 --> 00:21:35,629
know

514
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:38,030
genetics Balaji is that genes don't act

515
00:21:35,630 --> 00:21:40,250
alone so you often have interacting

516
00:21:38,029 --> 00:21:43,399
genes you have pathways you have multi

517
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:46,549
sub unique proteins and and the question

518
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:50,000
is can we actually using natural

519
00:21:46,549 --> 00:21:53,480
variation and and and and and and and

520
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:56,150
and the variance from these to identify

521
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:59,150
more than one gene but but there are the

522
00:21:56,150 --> 00:22:01,790
pathways or or modules of genes that

523
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:05,180
work together as proteins and and and

524
00:22:01,789 --> 00:22:08,569
are important in for regulating traits

525
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:10,160
and biological functions and so so so

526
00:22:08,569 --> 00:22:11,889
that is actually one of the one of the

527
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:14,090
most exciting applications of

528
00:22:11,890 --> 00:22:16,460
genome-wide Association mapping that I

529
00:22:14,089 --> 00:22:18,589
see because unlike a mutant screen where

530
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:21,319
you basically really try to isolate the

531
00:22:18,589 --> 00:22:23,929
one mutation we are having to deal with

532
00:22:21,319 --> 00:22:26,089
like a bunch of like of many mutations

533
00:22:23,930 --> 00:22:27,650
that we have to consider this you can

534
00:22:26,089 --> 00:22:29,689
see as a disadvantage it because it

535
00:22:27,650 --> 00:22:32,509
makes things complicated but you can see

536
00:22:29,690 --> 00:22:35,059
it also as an advantage because if you

537
00:22:32,509 --> 00:22:36,799
you might think that in one like to

538
00:22:35,059 --> 00:22:39,289
achieve one trait variation you might

539
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:41,750
target the same pathway multiple times

540
00:22:39,289 --> 00:22:44,000
and if this is so it might be a very

541
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:45,710
important pathway for that trait okay I

542
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,049
wouldn't tell you about this if I

543
00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:50,660
wouldn't believe in it so so this is why

544
00:22:48,049 --> 00:22:52,190
I believe in it so what you first need

545
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:54,440
to do if you want to consider multiple

546
00:22:52,190 --> 00:22:58,009
genes is you you need to map multiple

547
00:22:54,440 --> 00:23:00,110
genes and so so the key and V was is

548
00:22:58,009 --> 00:23:02,390
actually to increase the number of lines

549
00:23:00,109 --> 00:23:04,849
you look at because it's a statistical

550
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:06,950
approach it's a numbers game so so what

551
00:23:04,849 --> 00:23:09,199
we did here was we increase the number

552
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:11,539
of lines that we where we measured

553
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:17,140
growth rate up on iron deficiency from

554
00:23:11,539 --> 00:23:19,519
the 134 that I showed you into typical

555
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:22,009
200-250 lines that we typically use to

556
00:23:19,519 --> 00:23:25,220
almost 500 and you can see that there

557
00:23:22,009 --> 00:23:28,250
are way more signals above the

558
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:30,019
significant threshold than previously so

559
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:32,180
we got more than twenty now we can

560
00:23:30,019 --> 00:23:34,639
actually start to ask questions that are

561
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:37,039
other genes that are close and immediate

562
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:40,190
proximity of those Peaks possibly

563
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:43,099
interacting in the same pathway in the

564
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:44,370
same module and so to do this we we

565
00:23:43,099 --> 00:23:49,469
leveraged a genome

566
00:23:44,369 --> 00:23:52,409
Kayle gene model from a productions it's

567
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:54,750
called era net and that was basically

568
00:23:52,410 --> 00:23:57,029
generated by in Sewickley and soory slap

569
00:23:54,750 --> 00:24:00,420
at the Carnegie Institution a couple of

570
00:23:57,029 --> 00:24:02,190
years ago and it integrated all like

571
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:04,170
massive data types that were available

572
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:05,640
at that time and those were like

573
00:24:04,170 --> 00:24:08,039
expression datasets

574
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:10,440
Co expression from genes protein-protein

575
00:24:08,039 --> 00:24:12,329
interaction datasets literature mining

576
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:14,130
and so on in a probabilistic network

577
00:24:12,329 --> 00:24:16,500
model that essentially depicts the

578
00:24:14,130 --> 00:24:18,030
probability of any two genes and the

579
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:22,140
average of the genome to interact

580
00:24:18,029 --> 00:24:24,509
functionally and so so when we basically

581
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:27,420
ask then when they took this network and

582
00:24:24,509 --> 00:24:29,759
asked if genes that were like in

583
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:31,019
immediate proximity of those Peaks were

584
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:34,589
predicted to have a functional

585
00:24:31,019 --> 00:24:39,029
interaction we actually found quite some

586
00:24:34,589 --> 00:24:40,980
of those evidences there and when I

587
00:24:39,029 --> 00:24:43,678
first looked at this this this seemed to

588
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:47,000
be most interesting to me because it was

589
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:50,000
a leucine rich receptor kinase cluster

590
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,000
yes

591
00:24:54,069 --> 00:24:59,329
for those four genes we don't really

592
00:24:56,539 --> 00:25:02,629
know it's one of the one of the evidence

593
00:24:59,329 --> 00:25:06,289
codes in in the error net but for these

594
00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:08,390
genes it was actually coevolution the

595
00:25:06,289 --> 00:25:11,269
evidence code so basically a fighter

596
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:15,830
genomics core that gave gave rise to

597
00:25:11,269 --> 00:25:17,089
these potential interactions but but

598
00:25:15,829 --> 00:25:19,819
yeah so so we are currently

599
00:25:17,089 --> 00:25:22,250
investigating if these genes are always

600
00:25:19,819 --> 00:25:27,439
or maybe in specific conditions are

601
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:30,650
co-expressed so yeah so so that was very

602
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:32,600
interesting to us because like the one

603
00:25:30,650 --> 00:25:34,790
emerging paradigm in the field is that

604
00:25:32,599 --> 00:25:37,699
actually many of those receptor kinases

605
00:25:34,789 --> 00:25:40,009
that typically they I mean those those

606
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:42,769
are receptor kinases so they have a

607
00:25:40,009 --> 00:25:45,529
receptor domain leucine-rich receptor

608
00:25:42,769 --> 00:25:49,700
kinase domain leucine receptor now

609
00:25:45,529 --> 00:25:51,859
leucine-rich repeat domain outside of

610
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:54,559
the cell and in the tardis that they

611
00:25:51,859 --> 00:25:57,829
basically can detect ligands outside of

612
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:59,919
the cell and then activate the kinase to

613
00:25:57,829 --> 00:26:02,269
signal something in the cell and that

614
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:06,259
and it has also thought that they

615
00:26:02,269 --> 00:26:07,940
basically multiple lrrr Ches can

616
00:26:06,259 --> 00:26:10,269
interact on the membrane and even

617
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:14,750
compete compete with each other to

618
00:26:10,269 --> 00:26:16,819
prioritize you know growth or defense or

619
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:20,150
other processes so that there are keys

620
00:26:16,819 --> 00:26:22,909
to basically receive signals and in a

621
00:26:20,150 --> 00:26:25,610
combinatorial manner then lead to

622
00:26:22,910 --> 00:26:29,360
signaling cascades that affect growth

623
00:26:25,609 --> 00:26:31,189
and this is just one example of I think

624
00:26:29,359 --> 00:26:34,309
the best studied system from Joanne

625
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:37,340
Corey's lab mainly where the the bride

626
00:26:34,309 --> 00:26:40,029
one leucine-rich receptor like kinase

627
00:26:37,339 --> 00:26:44,000
leucine-rich repeat receptor like kinase

628
00:26:40,029 --> 00:26:45,980
interacts with others in computer and

629
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:49,099
and leads to a differential interaction

630
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:53,660
of ear but one with either this kinase

631
00:26:49,099 --> 00:26:55,609
or this kinase right so there is so so

632
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:58,370
so the thought the paradigm is basically

633
00:26:55,609 --> 00:26:59,689
now that but depending on the

634
00:26:58,369 --> 00:27:02,000
interaction and the abundance of

635
00:26:59,690 --> 00:27:04,130
receptors you might get a different

636
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,990
signaling output and that was the reason

637
00:27:04,130 --> 00:27:06,340
why I thought this might be interesting

638
00:27:05,990 --> 00:27:08,440
because

639
00:27:06,339 --> 00:27:10,689
we have three receptor kinases here and

640
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:13,360
one protein kinase that are downstream

641
00:27:10,690 --> 00:27:15,759
of receptor kinases and and that might

642
00:27:13,359 --> 00:27:18,490
just be like the module interesting to

643
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:20,319
perceive the absence of iron and then

644
00:27:18,490 --> 00:27:24,370
the two different cause responses okay

645
00:27:20,319 --> 00:27:27,730
so of course very hypothetical right so

646
00:27:24,369 --> 00:27:30,519
so the next step is of course because we

647
00:27:27,730 --> 00:27:34,269
before we wanted to embark on a very

648
00:27:30,519 --> 00:27:36,190
laborious journey to study this was to

649
00:27:34,269 --> 00:27:38,558
see if we find any other evidence than

650
00:27:36,190 --> 00:27:41,140
this Network evidence and the Seaworth

651
00:27:38,558 --> 00:27:44,379
evidence whether those four genes might

652
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:47,110
actually interact and when we think of

653
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:49,570
the data that we already used for here

654
00:27:47,109 --> 00:27:52,178
that's phenotypic data of accessions

655
00:27:49,569 --> 00:27:54,158
with different alleles we we can

656
00:27:52,179 --> 00:27:56,080
actually think we can reuse the data and

657
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:58,390
do a different test that is almost

658
00:27:56,079 --> 00:28:01,048
independent of this one so in

659
00:27:58,390 --> 00:28:04,059
genome-wide Association mapping we test

660
00:28:01,048 --> 00:28:06,460
for variations like the genotypic

661
00:28:04,058 --> 00:28:08,558
variation and phenotypic variation for

662
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:11,380
the correlation but we do it one snip at

663
00:28:08,558 --> 00:28:14,470
a time right we don't consider multiple

664
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:16,600
snips together now when we think those

665
00:28:14,470 --> 00:28:18,120
those genes and their variants might

666
00:28:16,599 --> 00:28:20,648
interact we can actually look for

667
00:28:18,119 --> 00:28:23,619
accessions that have certain

668
00:28:20,648 --> 00:28:24,369
combinations of those multiple of those

669
00:28:23,619 --> 00:28:28,148
four genes

670
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:30,668
and then see if certain combinations

671
00:28:28,148 --> 00:28:33,239
respond very different non-additive if

672
00:28:30,669 --> 00:28:35,169
you compare them to two to the other

673
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:36,759
combinations where you only have one and

674
00:28:35,169 --> 00:28:41,110
that's what you can do with the same

675
00:28:36,759 --> 00:28:44,019
data and that's what we did here so we

676
00:28:41,109 --> 00:28:46,538
have four genes and we can have each

677
00:28:44,019 --> 00:28:48,639
gene in a major or minor earlier

678
00:28:46,538 --> 00:28:52,058
configuration if you want to simplify it

679
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:54,159
to two versions and so so we can have

680
00:28:52,058 --> 00:28:56,230
exceptions that have either all of them

681
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:58,240
in the major earlier combination or you

682
00:28:56,230 --> 00:28:59,500
can have exceptions that have all of the

683
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:01,058
four genes in a minor league

684
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:02,019
configuration and you can have

685
00:29:01,058 --> 00:29:04,839
everything in-between

686
00:29:02,019 --> 00:29:06,548
right and so so what is striking from

687
00:29:04,839 --> 00:29:08,408
this image is that basically these

688
00:29:06,548 --> 00:29:10,839
higher-order minor league combinations

689
00:29:08,409 --> 00:29:13,659
all are fast growers so this is a growth

690
00:29:10,839 --> 00:29:16,269
rate up on iron deficiency and so the

691
00:29:13,659 --> 00:29:19,210
fastest growers are all exceptions that

692
00:29:16,269 --> 00:29:21,158
contain three or four combien

693
00:29:19,210 --> 00:29:24,340
of minor leaders of those four genes

694
00:29:21,159 --> 00:29:27,429
with one exception that is the the

695
00:29:24,339 --> 00:29:31,839
double combination for two specific

696
00:29:27,429 --> 00:29:33,788
genes for one and SS three so so that

697
00:29:31,839 --> 00:29:36,069
was to me at least it was enough to say

698
00:29:33,788 --> 00:29:39,099
okay let's spend some time to test

699
00:29:36,069 --> 00:29:41,079
whether this is true okay so I told

700
00:29:39,099 --> 00:29:44,139
Santosh my post of just generate all

701
00:29:41,079 --> 00:29:47,019
possible higher mutants and yeah I took

702
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:52,659
a while we get in a time machine three

703
00:29:47,019 --> 00:29:54,220
years later we have this so so so so

704
00:29:52,659 --> 00:29:57,010
this is basically the outcome of all

705
00:29:54,220 --> 00:30:00,009
possible combinations of those mutants

706
00:29:57,009 --> 00:30:01,720
so so we can see it's very complicated

707
00:30:00,009 --> 00:30:03,460
there are a lot of effects this is the

708
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:04,569
growth rate up an iron deficiency and

709
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:06,640
and this is kind of the same

710
00:30:04,569 --> 00:30:09,278
nomenclature as I showed you before with

711
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:11,259
the variants like four genes and the

712
00:30:09,278 --> 00:30:13,298
capital letter is the wild type form and

713
00:30:11,259 --> 00:30:16,898
then a non-capital letter is the mutant

714
00:30:13,298 --> 00:30:18,579
form okay so let's go let's go directly

715
00:30:16,898 --> 00:30:20,558
through the statistics here and I'm

716
00:30:18,579 --> 00:30:23,889
gonna guide you through this complex

717
00:30:20,558 --> 00:30:26,648
analysis okay so the first good news was

718
00:30:23,890 --> 00:30:29,288
that and we knew that before we tested

719
00:30:26,648 --> 00:30:32,769
the single mutants before but so so all

720
00:30:29,288 --> 00:30:35,349
of the single mutants are significantly

721
00:30:32,769 --> 00:30:38,528
different from from the wild-type so

722
00:30:35,349 --> 00:30:40,750
this is a significant code for the ANOVA

723
00:30:38,528 --> 00:30:43,720
and we can test the effect of singles

724
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:47,140
and of multiples okay so so we know that

725
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:48,819
all of these receptor like kinases so

726
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:51,490
those are those three and the protein

727
00:30:48,819 --> 00:30:54,210
kinase are somehow necessary for the

728
00:30:51,490 --> 00:30:57,159
appropriate response to iron deficiency

729
00:30:54,210 --> 00:30:59,679
okay so that's good interestingly like

730
00:30:57,159 --> 00:31:02,289
those those three actually grows much

731
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:06,130
slower than wild-type and this one grows

732
00:31:02,288 --> 00:31:07,658
slightly faster okay so so then we we

733
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:09,520
start with their interactions because

734
00:31:07,659 --> 00:31:12,220
that's our working hypothesis that those

735
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:14,788
four genes interact so the first one

736
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:16,870
actually is very striking the most

737
00:31:14,788 --> 00:31:18,669
interesting and most significant

738
00:31:16,869 --> 00:31:21,189
interaction actually occurs for those

739
00:31:18,669 --> 00:31:24,220
two receptor like kindnesses sr 3 and

740
00:31:21,190 --> 00:31:25,808
four one and you can see this very

741
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:27,548
nicely they really are aesthetically

742
00:31:25,808 --> 00:31:28,960
interact because if you look at the

743
00:31:27,548 --> 00:31:30,879
single mutants for those two genes

744
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:32,140
compared to the wild type they lead to a

745
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:33,070
strong reduction or

746
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:36,220
we'll go through it up on

747
00:31:33,069 --> 00:31:39,700
iron-deficiency right if you combine

748
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:43,960
those two mutations you actually get

749
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:46,240
less less lesser decrease right so

750
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:48,190
basically we were typically you know in

751
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:50,470
the additive model we would assume that

752
00:31:48,190 --> 00:31:52,840
we would get like a growth rate around

753
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:56,039
here but we actually get a growth rate

754
00:31:52,839 --> 00:31:59,048
that is reversed right so it's a typical

755
00:31:56,039 --> 00:32:00,879
it's a typical evidence for an epistatic

756
00:31:59,048 --> 00:32:04,569
interaction so those jeans truly

757
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:06,340
genetically interact and if you remember

758
00:32:04,569 --> 00:32:09,009
the variant analysis that I showed you

759
00:32:06,339 --> 00:32:10,689
previously it's the same combination

760
00:32:09,009 --> 00:32:12,940
that we actually show you that we

761
00:32:10,690 --> 00:32:16,150
actually found this dramatic increase

762
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:17,860
already using the double the double in

763
00:32:16,150 --> 00:32:19,840
the next sessions that actually covered

764
00:32:17,859 --> 00:32:21,369
the double minor-league combination so

765
00:32:19,839 --> 00:32:23,379
there's something special about this

766
00:32:21,369 --> 00:32:25,599
interaction okay

767
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:28,900
so that's a very primitive model so this

768
00:32:25,599 --> 00:32:31,480
is my leucine-rich repeat domain and

769
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:34,030
it's the kinase and so they - somehow

770
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:35,349
it's a working hypothesis interact

771
00:32:34,029 --> 00:32:37,058
they're on the membrane they interact

772
00:32:35,349 --> 00:32:40,359
and they somehow regulate growth upon

773
00:32:37,058 --> 00:32:43,960
iron deficiency so the question is is it

774
00:32:40,359 --> 00:32:45,969
is it actually true so some evidence

775
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:48,009
came actually interestingly at the time

776
00:32:45,970 --> 00:32:49,419
where we were still busy generating the

777
00:32:48,009 --> 00:32:53,109
double and the triple and quadruple

778
00:32:49,419 --> 00:32:55,720
mutants came from the lab of Yusef Kadir

779
00:32:53,109 --> 00:32:57,189
who is a colleague at who was a

780
00:32:55,720 --> 00:33:01,929
colleague at the Gregor Mendel Institute

781
00:32:57,190 --> 00:33:05,500
and he did in vitro screen for 80% of

782
00:33:01,929 --> 00:33:07,480
all leucine receptor leucine-rich

783
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:10,419
receptor like kinases in the arab

784
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:12,700
lobsters genome in multiple hundreds and

785
00:33:10,419 --> 00:33:16,540
he did an in vitro screen where he

786
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:19,600
expressed all of these and and scored

787
00:33:16,539 --> 00:33:22,178
the interaction using using a color

788
00:33:19,599 --> 00:33:24,399
assay and and one of the most noble

789
00:33:22,179 --> 00:33:26,919
notable interactions was a man among the

790
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:30,548
two receptor kinases that we found that

791
00:33:26,919 --> 00:33:31,929
were included in his in his essay so sf3

792
00:33:30,548 --> 00:33:34,918
and for one so that gave additional

793
00:33:31,929 --> 00:33:38,710
evidence that they might truly interact

794
00:33:34,919 --> 00:33:42,790
physically on the membrane we could also

795
00:33:38,710 --> 00:33:43,850
do when we did the KO IP to test this so

796
00:33:42,789 --> 00:33:46,279
we

797
00:33:43,849 --> 00:33:49,099
basically pull down first one receptor

798
00:33:46,279 --> 00:33:50,750
kindness sf3 and then we pulled from

799
00:33:49,099 --> 00:33:54,740
this pull down the other one with

800
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:56,569
another tag and and so we basically

801
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:58,250
could show that we can actually pull

802
00:33:56,569 --> 00:34:00,679
them down together so that they are very

803
00:33:58,250 --> 00:34:02,480
close by so so that would be another

804
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:04,940
evidence that they physically interact

805
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:08,000
and we're currently doing more advanced

806
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:11,139
microscopy to test us using using

807
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:13,670
advanced microscopy methods like Fred

808
00:34:11,139 --> 00:34:15,949
okay so so we believe that those two

809
00:34:13,670 --> 00:34:18,980
receptor kinase interact on the membrane

810
00:34:15,949 --> 00:34:21,739
but how does this relate to iron to low

811
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:26,269
iron levels and growth response to low

812
00:34:21,739 --> 00:34:28,879
iron levels so so when we treat reporter

813
00:34:26,269 --> 00:34:31,519
constructs that we express in tobacco

814
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:34,280
with water we we basically still see a

815
00:34:31,519 --> 00:34:36,829
high abundance of of these proteins that

816
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:39,800
are fused with fluorescent with the

817
00:34:36,829 --> 00:34:41,389
fluorescent protein in here in in the in

818
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:44,090
the membrane but when we basically

819
00:34:41,389 --> 00:34:46,759
withdraw the iron we see that actually

820
00:34:44,090 --> 00:34:48,800
the signal gets much weaker we can

821
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:51,230
actually see this when we do the Western

822
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:53,210
blot in the cemetery we can see that if

823
00:34:51,230 --> 00:34:57,199
we treat with an agent that removes the

824
00:34:53,210 --> 00:34:59,869
iron we lose this protein right it gets

825
00:34:57,199 --> 00:35:02,689
degraded so so one of the mechanisms

826
00:34:59,869 --> 00:35:05,299
that that somehow plays a role here is

827
00:35:02,690 --> 00:35:07,099
that if you have low iron levels the

828
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:09,500
receptor kinase will be removed from the

829
00:35:07,099 --> 00:35:11,690
membrane so the interaction partner when

830
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:13,519
we did the same experiment as here we

831
00:35:11,690 --> 00:35:16,250
didn't observe any depletion from the

832
00:35:13,519 --> 00:35:19,039
membrane so so we think actually in the

833
00:35:16,250 --> 00:35:21,590
context of this office of this receptor

834
00:35:19,039 --> 00:35:24,500
kinase module we have the two receptors

835
00:35:21,590 --> 00:35:27,230
that are interacting and then iron

836
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:29,510
deficiency leads to the removal of one

837
00:35:27,230 --> 00:35:31,099
and and this other one might be free for

838
00:35:29,510 --> 00:35:35,060
interaction with other partners on the

839
00:35:31,099 --> 00:35:36,920
membrane of course we wanted to test if

840
00:35:35,059 --> 00:35:38,059
this is really true in the root so those

841
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:42,710
who are just

842
00:35:38,059 --> 00:35:44,420
tobacco SAS and because we can do long

843
00:35:42,710 --> 00:35:48,740
term imaging we can actually do the same

844
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:51,530
experiments in growing roots and so so

845
00:35:48,739 --> 00:35:53,629
that is one of our experiments where we

846
00:35:51,530 --> 00:35:55,640
track the root over time

847
00:35:53,630 --> 00:35:58,940
and on the same microscope we have a two

848
00:35:55,639 --> 00:36:01,129
chamber system we basically add water to

849
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:04,610
this and we add further on to this it

850
00:36:01,130 --> 00:36:06,440
removes the iron right and so the signal

851
00:36:04,610 --> 00:36:08,960
that you observe here is again from this

852
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:10,820
one receptor kinase that we think is

853
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:13,159
degraded and you can see under normal

854
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:14,780
conditions the signal is quite constant

855
00:36:13,159 --> 00:36:17,029
and the growth is quite constant of the

856
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:20,019
root but under iron deficient conditions

857
00:36:17,030 --> 00:36:22,730
you can see two very interesting things

858
00:36:20,019 --> 00:36:24,769
there's no growth and at the same time

859
00:36:22,730 --> 00:36:27,289
the level of this receptor kinase is

860
00:36:24,769 --> 00:36:29,449
much lower then somehow there is an

861
00:36:27,289 --> 00:36:31,670
increase of the signal again so there's

862
00:36:29,449 --> 00:36:33,859
more receptor kinase gets again in the

863
00:36:31,670 --> 00:36:35,990
membrane and that is the point of time

864
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:37,880
when it starts growing again so

865
00:36:35,989 --> 00:36:40,250
basically the abundance of this receptor

866
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:44,240
kinase correlates very well with growth

867
00:36:40,250 --> 00:36:45,800
under iron deficient conditions we did

868
00:36:44,239 --> 00:36:47,239
this experiment more than 12 times

869
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:50,060
repeated and we can see very

870
00:36:47,239 --> 00:36:52,759
reproducibly that the signal off the

871
00:36:50,059 --> 00:36:54,920
protein is kind of stays constant under

872
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:57,830
control conditions and basically

873
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:59,869
decreases much under ferrous iron iron

874
00:36:57,829 --> 00:37:03,710
deficiency conditions and then increases

875
00:36:59,869 --> 00:37:06,529
again at a point so so we think the the

876
00:37:03,710 --> 00:37:08,269
transient essays that we the essays that

877
00:37:06,530 --> 00:37:10,640
we did in tobacco are really well

878
00:37:08,269 --> 00:37:13,009
representing that one of the effects of

879
00:37:10,639 --> 00:37:16,099
the iron deficiency is to remove this

880
00:37:13,010 --> 00:37:19,940
receptor kinase from the membrane okay

881
00:37:16,099 --> 00:37:23,059
so let's get back to our power

882
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:25,130
experiment here so we can actually see

883
00:37:23,059 --> 00:37:27,469
multiple other interaction terms and

884
00:37:25,130 --> 00:37:29,780
essentially it tells us that there's

885
00:37:27,469 --> 00:37:31,639
evidence from the genetics that all

886
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:34,850
these four genes interact based on the

887
00:37:31,639 --> 00:37:38,329
mutant analysis so this leads to another

888
00:37:34,849 --> 00:37:40,099
very non sophisticated model that that

889
00:37:38,329 --> 00:37:41,989
basically all of them somehow interact

890
00:37:40,099 --> 00:37:44,750
and that they impact growth okay so

891
00:37:41,989 --> 00:37:46,909
that's not very satisfying so we were

892
00:37:44,750 --> 00:37:50,989
very happy when we got another hint from

893
00:37:46,909 --> 00:37:53,599
Yousefi dears lab because he had done

894
00:37:50,989 --> 00:37:55,089
this in vitro screen of 80% of all the

895
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:58,779
receptor kinase leucine-rich repeat

896
00:37:55,090 --> 00:38:02,030
receptor kinases and Abraxas and another

897
00:37:58,780 --> 00:38:05,630
interaction that he found with fir which

898
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:06,830
is the ii kinase that we had found that

899
00:38:05,630 --> 00:38:09,440
i showed you here

900
00:38:06,829 --> 00:38:12,469
was that it interact with flagella and

901
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:15,349
receptor FLS - so this is a receptor

902
00:38:12,469 --> 00:38:17,929
that that perceives flagellin from

903
00:38:15,349 --> 00:38:20,869
bacteria and leads to the onset of the

904
00:38:17,929 --> 00:38:23,750
defense response and so so that made us

905
00:38:20,869 --> 00:38:26,230
to think that that maybe we found a

906
00:38:23,750 --> 00:38:30,050
module that somehow connects defense and

907
00:38:26,230 --> 00:38:32,389
iron deficiency signaling and so the

908
00:38:30,050 --> 00:38:34,610
first thing that we did together with

909
00:38:32,389 --> 00:38:38,599
yourself was to test the effect of

910
00:38:34,610 --> 00:38:41,030
flagellin on the root growth of of the

911
00:38:38,599 --> 00:38:43,099
mutant so so in the wild-type if you

912
00:38:41,030 --> 00:38:44,810
apply for Jaylyn here you see a

913
00:38:43,099 --> 00:38:47,900
reduction of root growth because the

914
00:38:44,809 --> 00:38:49,670
root stops to grow but this is abolished

915
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:51,829
in the receptor mutant because there's

916
00:38:49,670 --> 00:38:54,470
no receptor to perceive the flagellum

917
00:38:51,829 --> 00:38:57,049
and it's also abolished in the FIR

918
00:38:54,469 --> 00:39:01,039
mutant which is our one of our receptor

919
00:38:57,050 --> 00:39:02,600
kinases you can can see this here so

920
00:39:01,039 --> 00:39:04,610
somehow we have found though at least

921
00:39:02,599 --> 00:39:06,589
one of these receptors that we found is

922
00:39:04,610 --> 00:39:09,170
involved in the regulation of growth

923
00:39:06,590 --> 00:39:11,269
upon iron deficiency but also upon the

924
00:39:09,170 --> 00:39:14,809
presence of mayor of molecular

925
00:39:11,269 --> 00:39:17,239
signatures of pathogens and this is also

926
00:39:14,809 --> 00:39:19,070
true so the the Ross response is one of

927
00:39:17,239 --> 00:39:21,379
the earliest defense response is also

928
00:39:19,070 --> 00:39:23,539
impaired in this fur mutant all right so

929
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:26,960
so more evidence that there is a

930
00:39:23,539 --> 00:39:30,469
connection between growth regulation and

931
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:33,710
a low iron conditions and under defense

932
00:39:30,469 --> 00:39:35,829
situations and you can also see that the

933
00:39:33,710 --> 00:39:39,260
if you look at the growth of bacteria

934
00:39:35,829 --> 00:39:42,230
basically the firm you is almost as as

935
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:45,170
much compromised as the FLS to mutant

936
00:39:42,230 --> 00:39:46,579
here so so we know then that one of the

937
00:39:45,170 --> 00:39:49,099
components we found is involved

938
00:39:46,579 --> 00:39:51,559
interestingly another receptor kinase of

939
00:39:49,099 --> 00:39:53,690
the of the three we found si 3 and there

940
00:39:51,559 --> 00:39:55,820
was also the one that I showed you

941
00:39:53,690 --> 00:39:59,630
earlier with its interaction with but

942
00:39:55,820 --> 00:40:01,789
with fur one has also been implicated in

943
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:05,470
immunity in a different study before

944
00:40:01,789 --> 00:40:08,360
bye-bye Jane Parker where basically this

945
00:40:05,469 --> 00:40:10,459
mutation of this and different alleles

946
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:13,640
lead to compromised immune response

947
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:15,739
so so this in leads to our current

948
00:40:13,639 --> 00:40:19,219
working model that I want to share with

949
00:40:15,739 --> 00:40:21,949
you where we actually have we have we

950
00:40:19,219 --> 00:40:25,098
have stumbled upon this module here and

951
00:40:21,949 --> 00:40:28,129
we know it is important for the

952
00:40:25,099 --> 00:40:31,960
regulation of growth up on iron low iron

953
00:40:28,130 --> 00:40:34,970
levels and we we know also that at least

954
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:37,009
like this this part you can interact

955
00:40:34,969 --> 00:40:38,629
with the effortless 2 receptor and what

956
00:40:37,009 --> 00:40:42,429
we actually think what's happening here

957
00:40:38,630 --> 00:40:45,528
is that it's a module that processes

958
00:40:42,429 --> 00:40:48,759
signals from bacteria or like signatures

959
00:40:45,528 --> 00:40:51,798
from bacteria and iron abundance it like

960
00:40:48,759 --> 00:40:54,588
in the same module on the membrane so

961
00:40:51,798 --> 00:40:57,889
when when there's iron when there's iron

962
00:40:54,588 --> 00:40:59,478
deficiency so typically those three are

963
00:40:57,889 --> 00:41:02,239
in a complex under happy growth

964
00:40:59,478 --> 00:41:05,358
conditions no irons or pathogens and so

965
00:41:02,239 --> 00:41:07,489
under iron defer one is basically not

966
00:41:05,358 --> 00:41:10,909
available for an interaction with FLS 2

967
00:41:07,489 --> 00:41:12,829
but if the iron is going away and we

968
00:41:10,909 --> 00:41:15,679
think this might be in part perceived by

969
00:41:12,829 --> 00:41:17,150
this receptor kinase you remember the

970
00:41:15,679 --> 00:41:19,909
mutant actually had increased growth

971
00:41:17,150 --> 00:41:23,150
rate under iron deficiency as if it

972
00:41:19,909 --> 00:41:24,528
wouldn't sense that the iron is low we

973
00:41:23,150 --> 00:41:27,950
think we know that

974
00:41:24,528 --> 00:41:30,318
saf3 is actually degraded and those two

975
00:41:27,949 --> 00:41:33,588
receptor kinases don't interact directly

976
00:41:30,318 --> 00:41:36,199
and fur is actually free to interact

977
00:41:33,588 --> 00:41:38,778
with FLS 2 receptor which somehow needs

978
00:41:36,199 --> 00:41:40,518
to stop off growth so that's a working

979
00:41:38,778 --> 00:41:43,278
model and there are many open questions

980
00:41:40,518 --> 00:41:46,068
which we currently solving by code

981
00:41:43,278 --> 00:41:49,028
treating with iron and flagellum and and

982
00:41:46,068 --> 00:41:51,079
so so to corroborate this working

983
00:41:49,028 --> 00:41:52,789
hypothesis I mean what is known that

984
00:41:51,079 --> 00:41:56,089
there's a there's a very intimate

985
00:41:52,789 --> 00:41:57,680
relation of iron levels and defense that

986
00:41:56,088 --> 00:42:00,318
has been described in a very descriptive

987
00:41:57,679 --> 00:42:01,608
manner in the past by people and we

988
00:42:00,318 --> 00:42:04,400
think that actually might be a key

989
00:42:01,608 --> 00:42:07,778
module so I think what this this nicely

990
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:10,338
shows is that you you can't can leverage

991
00:42:07,778 --> 00:42:12,259
you know quantitative genetic approaches

992
00:42:10,338 --> 00:42:14,119
to identify multiple genes get to

993
00:42:12,259 --> 00:42:17,289
interesting mechanisms that tell you not

994
00:42:14,119 --> 00:42:21,289
interesting and novel biology and lead

995
00:42:17,289 --> 00:42:23,390
to to basically a better understanding

996
00:42:21,289 --> 00:42:24,680
how actually there's crosstalk and then

997
00:42:23,389 --> 00:42:26,598
interesting thing about this crosstalk

998
00:42:24,679 --> 00:42:30,528
is that it seems to be entirely

999
00:42:26,599 --> 00:42:35,559
happening on the membrane okay so I'm

1000
00:42:30,528 --> 00:42:38,690
running out of time is that yeah okay a

1001
00:42:35,559 --> 00:42:41,059
few minutes okay so so there's the other

1002
00:42:38,690 --> 00:42:43,220
question so is this is this specific to

1003
00:42:41,059 --> 00:42:44,930
iron so when we stumbled about this we

1004
00:42:43,219 --> 00:42:48,828
were actually very we were kind of

1005
00:42:44,929 --> 00:42:50,358
surprised and and so so so we are

1006
00:42:48,829 --> 00:42:53,750
thinking okay so it's just one way

1007
00:42:50,358 --> 00:42:55,848
there's like this one intersection of of

1008
00:42:53,750 --> 00:42:58,010
the response to micronutrient

1009
00:42:55,849 --> 00:43:00,019
deficiencies or low levels in the

1010
00:42:58,010 --> 00:43:02,900
environment and defense but when we then

1011
00:43:00,018 --> 00:43:05,328
it's other screens and we do a lot of

1012
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:07,730
screens we actually found something very

1013
00:43:05,329 --> 00:43:08,900
interesting in collaboration with heart

1014
00:43:07,730 --> 00:43:10,490
and we were share true is that the in

1015
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:12,619
ROM Whomper here when we looked at zinc

1016
00:43:10,489 --> 00:43:15,139
deficiency response but you can see very

1017
00:43:12,619 --> 00:43:16,778
nicely that accessions also respond very

1018
00:43:15,139 --> 00:43:19,219
differently some accessions actually

1019
00:43:16,778 --> 00:43:21,018
don't bother very much even increase the

1020
00:43:19,219 --> 00:43:22,788
growth rate and the zinc deficiency in

1021
00:43:21,018 --> 00:43:24,139
the first couple of days and some of

1022
00:43:22,789 --> 00:43:27,079
them actually reduce the growth rate

1023
00:43:24,139 --> 00:43:29,210
quite a bit so we met this we found a

1024
00:43:27,079 --> 00:43:34,460
zinc deficiency specific peak on

1025
00:43:29,210 --> 00:43:37,789
chromosome 4 and that was located very

1026
00:43:34,460 --> 00:43:40,338
close to the ACI one gene and other azi

1027
00:43:37,789 --> 00:43:45,259
so ACI one gene is implicated in

1028
00:43:40,338 --> 00:43:50,210
systemic immunity in priming based on

1029
00:43:45,259 --> 00:43:52,730
the effect of it's a lake asset and that

1030
00:43:50,210 --> 00:43:54,650
already have been described and it's the

1031
00:43:52,730 --> 00:43:57,108
prime candidate in this region because

1032
00:43:54,650 --> 00:43:59,539
it's also expressed much higher up on

1033
00:43:57,108 --> 00:44:03,619
zinc deficiency than all the other genes

1034
00:43:59,539 --> 00:44:05,240
in this region so so when we then use

1035
00:44:03,619 --> 00:44:07,579
the mutant and the OVA expressor and

1036
00:44:05,239 --> 00:44:09,469
conducted those growth essays under zinc

1037
00:44:07,579 --> 00:44:12,559
deficiency conditions we actually see

1038
00:44:09,469 --> 00:44:15,308
that that these that the lack of a zi1

1039
00:44:12,559 --> 00:44:18,528
that is is an immunity gene actually

1040
00:44:15,309 --> 00:44:22,359
causes roots to grow very to respond

1041
00:44:18,528 --> 00:44:22,358
very differently to the zinc deficiency

1042
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:27,420
so this seems to be specific to zinc and

1043
00:44:25,409 --> 00:44:28,949
and when we did the same essay with the

1044
00:44:27,420 --> 00:44:31,829
same Newton and over a special line

1045
00:44:28,949 --> 00:44:34,169
there was no difference under iron so

1046
00:44:31,829 --> 00:44:36,119
when we did the complementation we could

1047
00:44:34,170 --> 00:44:39,119
actually conclude a zi variation that

1048
00:44:36,119 --> 00:44:41,130
the a zi locus is is truly causal for

1049
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:44,279
this different closed behavior under

1050
00:44:41,130 --> 00:44:47,130
zinc deficiency because if we took a

1051
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:49,620
long route allele and transformed it a

1052
00:44:47,130 --> 00:44:51,119
long route a zi le transformed in the in

1053
00:44:49,619 --> 00:44:53,009
the knockout it was much better

1054
00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:59,549
complementing the short route phenotype

1055
00:44:53,010 --> 00:45:02,040
under - think so so then of course the

1056
00:44:59,550 --> 00:45:03,720
obvious obvious conclusion or the

1057
00:45:02,039 --> 00:45:07,460
hypothesis would be that there's an

1058
00:45:03,719 --> 00:45:10,259
interaction between a zelich acid and

1059
00:45:07,460 --> 00:45:12,329
and zinc deficiency because this is one

1060
00:45:10,260 --> 00:45:14,400
of the the a zi one gene is one of the

1061
00:45:12,329 --> 00:45:18,029
key genes is required for the response

1062
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:19,740
off of the plans to this to this signal

1063
00:45:18,030 --> 00:45:22,530
immunity rarely signaling compound and

1064
00:45:19,739 --> 00:45:27,479
indeed it is so if we look under zinc

1065
00:45:22,530 --> 00:45:29,820
deficiency we can see that basically the

1066
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:32,460
the reduction of root growth rate that

1067
00:45:29,820 --> 00:45:36,420
we observe in wild-type with the

1068
00:45:32,460 --> 00:45:38,579
application of aza is abolished in zinc

1069
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:42,240
limited conditions and this abolishment

1070
00:45:38,579 --> 00:45:45,210
is largely dependent on a zi one so we

1071
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:49,529
so we think there is a complicated ACI

1072
00:45:45,210 --> 00:45:52,110
one so is there like acid immune related

1073
00:45:49,530 --> 00:45:55,710
signals are dependent on the zinc status

1074
00:45:52,110 --> 00:45:57,390
of the plants and we even like thought

1075
00:45:55,710 --> 00:45:58,860
this is this is very interesting we

1076
00:45:57,389 --> 00:46:00,809
don't really know what this means

1077
00:45:58,860 --> 00:46:02,309
I mean we know that zinc and iron as

1078
00:46:00,809 --> 00:46:05,130
well are very very important for immune

1079
00:46:02,309 --> 00:46:07,980
responses and that there's in many

1080
00:46:05,130 --> 00:46:10,410
systems there is a kind of war for for

1081
00:46:07,980 --> 00:46:13,590
iron and also zinc is used for defense

1082
00:46:10,409 --> 00:46:15,239
responses whether this simple

1083
00:46:13,590 --> 00:46:18,780
interaction is is also conserved in

1084
00:46:15,239 --> 00:46:20,669
different plant species and so so we did

1085
00:46:18,780 --> 00:46:23,580
the experiment in rice because it was in

1086
00:46:20,670 --> 00:46:26,039
hand for a collaborator of Hatton and so

1087
00:46:23,579 --> 00:46:28,289
you can see that actually this root

1088
00:46:26,039 --> 00:46:30,119
inhibition of root development so when

1089
00:46:28,289 --> 00:46:32,039
we increase the concentration of aza

1090
00:46:30,119 --> 00:46:33,690
under normal conditions inks sufficient

1091
00:46:32,039 --> 00:46:35,699
we basically

1092
00:46:33,690 --> 00:46:38,849
inhibit the formation after root

1093
00:46:35,699 --> 00:46:41,278
completely right or the emergence of the

1094
00:46:38,849 --> 00:46:43,380
root and if we remove the zinc from the

1095
00:46:41,278 --> 00:46:46,798
medium we basically don't affect this

1096
00:46:43,380 --> 00:46:49,829
process at all right so so there so this

1097
00:46:46,798 --> 00:46:54,059
interaction of zinc levels and AZ and

1098
00:46:49,829 --> 00:46:57,720
acetic acid and in Abraxas depend on a

1099
00:46:54,059 --> 00:47:00,089
zi1 is it's truly somehow a process

1100
00:46:57,719 --> 00:47:02,038
that's relevant for for many species and

1101
00:47:00,088 --> 00:47:04,288
and the big question is why why is it

1102
00:47:02,039 --> 00:47:07,109
actually okay but that's a question that

1103
00:47:04,289 --> 00:47:10,109
I can answer right now I mean just other

1104
00:47:07,108 --> 00:47:11,848
than speculating okay so I just go to

1105
00:47:10,108 --> 00:47:14,940
the acknowledgments so I hope I've shown

1106
00:47:11,849 --> 00:47:16,619
you that you know the the way that we

1107
00:47:14,940 --> 00:47:18,720
approach this problem using natural

1108
00:47:16,619 --> 00:47:21,000
variation can tell us a lot on how roots

1109
00:47:18,719 --> 00:47:23,730
decide to grow or not to grow because it

1110
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:25,679
depends on genes and genetic variants

1111
00:47:23,730 --> 00:47:27,420
how at which levels in which time

1112
00:47:25,679 --> 00:47:29,848
actually growth has stopped and

1113
00:47:27,420 --> 00:47:32,490
presumably defenses and in those two

1114
00:47:29,849 --> 00:47:34,650
cases are basically defense responses

1115
00:47:32,489 --> 00:47:37,528
are started and and this work was mainly

1116
00:47:34,650 --> 00:47:39,869
done by so the iron did work was done by

1117
00:47:37,528 --> 00:47:41,759
central sucked by a postdoc who started

1118
00:47:39,869 --> 00:47:43,619
a couple of years ago at the GM I now

1119
00:47:41,759 --> 00:47:46,289
came with me to sock which I'm very

1120
00:47:43,619 --> 00:47:48,450
happy about was assisted by a master

1121
00:47:46,289 --> 00:47:50,430
student very talented and the second

1122
00:47:48,449 --> 00:47:53,460
part of the story was also done by

1123
00:47:50,429 --> 00:47:56,250
Santos at bi and and most of the work

1124
00:47:53,460 --> 00:47:58,349
was actually done in Homs brochettes lab

1125
00:47:56,250 --> 00:48:02,239
at Enron Montpellier by Nadia Blanc and

1126
00:47:58,349 --> 00:48:02,240
with that I thank you for your attention

1127
00:48:05,179 --> 00:48:08,359
very much

1128
00:48:12,210 --> 00:48:16,360
you know what the mechanism

1129
00:48:13,980 --> 00:48:18,730
stop

1130
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:22,510
yeah that's that's a that's a very

1131
00:48:18,730 --> 00:48:25,030
that's a very good question well we know

1132
00:48:22,510 --> 00:48:27,220
that the meristem basically they get

1133
00:48:25,030 --> 00:48:30,010
shorter cell division activity goes down

1134
00:48:27,219 --> 00:48:33,549
so there will be that there will be

1135
00:48:30,010 --> 00:48:35,800
signaling on the cell cycle by which

1136
00:48:33,550 --> 00:48:39,370
means we don't really know whether it's

1137
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:42,039
like you know oxen dependent or or any

1138
00:48:39,369 --> 00:48:45,069
other signaling pathway we don't really

1139
00:48:42,039 --> 00:48:48,570
know but yeah once we have all this we

1140
00:48:45,070 --> 00:48:48,570
can actually test this using mutants

1141
00:48:56,030 --> 00:48:59,230
when you get up

1142
00:48:59,469 --> 00:49:03,748
a bunch of challenge

1143
00:49:01,048 --> 00:49:06,028
the intuition rather the promotion what

1144
00:49:03,748 --> 00:49:09,639
was the reason for that and can you say

1145
00:49:06,028 --> 00:49:11,710
anything about these enhanced

1146
00:49:09,639 --> 00:49:16,028
yeah so that's a that's a very good

1147
00:49:11,710 --> 00:49:19,929
question so we also pursued the growth

1148
00:49:16,028 --> 00:49:21,190
control and and phosphate but with the

1149
00:49:19,929 --> 00:49:24,068
iron

1150
00:49:21,190 --> 00:49:25,599
we were just faster so with the foster

1151
00:49:24,068 --> 00:49:28,869
we haven't quite figured out we didn't

1152
00:49:25,599 --> 00:49:30,430
find for instance so so we okay so we

1153
00:49:28,869 --> 00:49:32,680
didn't increase the number of accessions

1154
00:49:30,429 --> 00:49:36,098
to have better mapping ability and

1155
00:49:32,679 --> 00:49:38,429
phosphate because we were the postdoc

1156
00:49:36,099 --> 00:49:40,900
who was working on the iron was faster

1157
00:49:38,429 --> 00:49:43,929
doing this so it's not it's not

1158
00:49:40,900 --> 00:49:46,180
intentional design but rather the way

1159
00:49:43,929 --> 00:49:48,098
how it is historically developed with

1160
00:49:46,179 --> 00:49:52,149
bits faucet so it's a one thing that I'm

1161
00:49:48,099 --> 00:49:54,430
currently doing at Salk is that we will

1162
00:49:52,150 --> 00:49:56,048
with it be overcoming some bottlenecks

1163
00:49:54,429 --> 00:49:57,969
for those studies so the major

1164
00:49:56,048 --> 00:49:58,358
bottleneck is actually pipetting hands

1165
00:49:57,969 --> 00:50:00,788
right now

1166
00:49:58,358 --> 00:50:02,288
to put the seeds on plates and so i'm

1167
00:50:00,789 --> 00:50:05,289
building right now robot and we will do

1168
00:50:02,289 --> 00:50:07,420
basically all these conditions with a

1169
00:50:05,289 --> 00:50:09,220
thousand accessions and we'll have much

1170
00:50:07,420 --> 00:50:11,739
better mapping ability and then can

1171
00:50:09,219 --> 00:50:14,169
really in enforceable conditions also

1172
00:50:11,739 --> 00:50:17,230
consider this multi gene approach so so

1173
00:50:14,170 --> 00:50:20,130
yeah so i probably in five years i can

1174
00:50:17,230 --> 00:50:20,130
answer your question

1175
00:50:22,739 --> 00:50:27,739
the physiologist to be more

1176
00:50:25,849 --> 00:50:29,559
now with growing pains

1177
00:50:27,739 --> 00:50:31,989
and hydroponics

1178
00:50:29,559 --> 00:50:35,579
growing plants or Niagara's especially

1179
00:50:31,989 --> 00:50:35,579
when I've got terribly convenient

1180
00:50:38,130 --> 00:50:43,630
so one of my first questions

1181
00:50:40,699 --> 00:50:43,629
tested

1182
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:47,010
relationships under

1183
00:50:47,139 --> 00:50:51,869
such that you verify there were one

1184
00:50:49,360 --> 00:50:54,860
number two

1185
00:50:51,869 --> 00:50:54,859
for longer periods

1186
00:50:56,369 --> 00:51:01,150
those witches

1187
00:50:58,420 --> 00:51:05,170
yeah yes so so that is a very valid

1188
00:51:01,150 --> 00:51:07,240
concerns concern so so first of all we

1189
00:51:05,170 --> 00:51:08,950
are most interested in the signaling

1190
00:51:07,239 --> 00:51:12,789
aspect in this kind of decision-making

1191
00:51:08,949 --> 00:51:15,009
aspect so so so we think actually

1192
00:51:12,789 --> 00:51:17,050
growing them very early already tells us

1193
00:51:15,010 --> 00:51:18,640
something about this now if we're

1194
00:51:17,050 --> 00:51:20,590
thinking about everything that relates

1195
00:51:18,639 --> 00:51:24,069
to adaptation I think it's very very

1196
00:51:20,590 --> 00:51:26,140
important to consider soil and later

1197
00:51:24,070 --> 00:51:28,030
because phenotypes and another project

1198
00:51:26,139 --> 00:51:30,609
that I didn't talk about where we looked

1199
00:51:28,030 --> 00:51:32,800
at more at at the angle at which roots

1200
00:51:30,610 --> 00:51:36,309
grow and we found a very interesting

1201
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:38,050
gene and exercise gene that that

1202
00:51:36,309 --> 00:51:40,150
actually affects how our oxygen is

1203
00:51:38,050 --> 00:51:42,850
transported we did the experiment that

1204
00:51:40,150 --> 00:51:45,880
we basically cut the extreme accessions

1205
00:51:42,849 --> 00:51:47,710
that we knew were very different in

1206
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:49,599
their early growth behavior in very

1207
00:51:47,710 --> 00:51:53,470
large soil parts and then we did

1208
00:51:49,599 --> 00:51:54,880
excavation and indeed those accessions

1209
00:51:53,469 --> 00:51:59,309
were very different in terms of their

1210
00:51:54,880 --> 00:52:01,090
rooting depth so in that in for in that

1211
00:51:59,309 --> 00:52:03,579
for that question

1212
00:52:01,090 --> 00:52:05,590
it it seems that there was a very almost

1213
00:52:03,579 --> 00:52:08,139
linear relationship between those early

1214
00:52:05,590 --> 00:52:10,300
growth rates that we measured and the

1215
00:52:08,139 --> 00:52:12,670
rooting depth now that is not not

1216
00:52:10,300 --> 00:52:14,710
necessarily true for other conditions

1217
00:52:12,670 --> 00:52:17,139
for instance if we think about those

1218
00:52:14,710 --> 00:52:18,970
nutrient deficiencies of course at some

1219
00:52:17,139 --> 00:52:20,739
point you know plants will run out of

1220
00:52:18,969 --> 00:52:24,519
the nutrients and then they I mean they

1221
00:52:20,739 --> 00:52:27,009
don't have enough to grow right so so so

1222
00:52:24,519 --> 00:52:28,809
that would be anyway like the the

1223
00:52:27,010 --> 00:52:30,490
question of nutrient deficiency and

1224
00:52:28,809 --> 00:52:32,469
homeostasis is a very different question

1225
00:52:30,489 --> 00:52:34,659
from the dawn of the one that we are

1226
00:52:32,469 --> 00:52:37,619
asking right now but it would be good

1227
00:52:34,659 --> 00:52:40,449
yeah I mean like for questions that that

1228
00:52:37,619 --> 00:52:43,480
that that are related to adaptation we

1229
00:52:40,449 --> 00:52:47,980
have to do those experiments and I agree

1230
00:52:43,480 --> 00:52:50,719
and we're doing as much as we can

1231
00:52:47,980 --> 00:52:53,000
further complications are you

1232
00:52:50,719 --> 00:52:55,869
notification sure that along with

1233
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,869
contingent

1234
00:52:56,969 --> 00:53:01,669
yes so the negative

1235
00:53:03,050 --> 00:53:08,900
one strategy for development inspector

1236
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:13,630
that would depend on the integrated

1237
00:53:12,150 --> 00:53:16,119
aspect of practice

1238
00:53:13,630 --> 00:53:18,039
I think in the end it's the integrated

1239
00:53:16,119 --> 00:53:20,470
aspect of plant physiology because the

1240
00:53:18,039 --> 00:53:22,269
plan has to grow and produce enough

1241
00:53:20,469 --> 00:53:26,139
seeds to survive and that is the trade I

1242
00:53:22,268 --> 00:53:28,389
mean that will be selected on for sure

1243
00:53:26,139 --> 00:53:30,548
but but the environment I mean all these

1244
00:53:28,389 --> 00:53:32,259
accessions will have adapted to certain

1245
00:53:30,548 --> 00:53:34,000
environments and the way how you

1246
00:53:32,259 --> 00:53:35,528
actually are more fit in those different

1247
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:37,778
environments will be very different and

1248
00:53:35,528 --> 00:53:39,190
just the question that I referred with

1249
00:53:37,778 --> 00:53:42,068
the root system architecture where we

1250
00:53:39,190 --> 00:53:45,400
then really looked at root system in the

1251
00:53:42,068 --> 00:53:47,920
soil that really related to

1252
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:49,599
precipitation seasonality so so the

1253
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:52,210
alleles that conferred either the

1254
00:53:49,599 --> 00:53:54,759
shallow or the deep one were were

1255
00:53:52,210 --> 00:53:56,528
basically correlated with the frequency

1256
00:53:54,759 --> 00:53:59,528
of rainfall in the areas where they came

1257
00:53:56,528 --> 00:54:02,139
from so it really depends I mean the a

1258
00:53:59,528 --> 00:54:04,119
good root system is only good for a

1259
00:54:02,139 --> 00:54:06,250
certain number of environments and and

1260
00:54:04,119 --> 00:54:11,220
not for all environments and at least

1261
00:54:06,250 --> 00:54:11,219
for those wild species I think

1262
00:54:14,929 --> 00:54:21,190
the hope our scientists could

1263
00:54:17,909 --> 00:54:27,649
in touch interaction between Zionism

1264
00:54:21,190 --> 00:54:29,869
how far yeah I would I would need to

1265
00:54:27,650 --> 00:54:31,490
look that up but but they basically what

1266
00:54:29,869 --> 00:54:33,650
they did for generating the fight of

1267
00:54:31,489 --> 00:54:35,149
genomics core they looked at auto logs

1268
00:54:33,650 --> 00:54:38,000
and many different genomes and looked at

1269
00:54:35,150 --> 00:54:39,320
either co-occurrence or Co absent like

1270
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:43,000
you know either one or the other

1271
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:43,000
but I I would need to look that up

1272
00:54:48,179 --> 00:54:54,480
yes but that also depends on the on the

1273
00:54:51,340 --> 00:54:54,480
on the condition

1274
00:55:00,369 --> 00:55:05,499
we really haven't looked for this but we

1275
00:55:03,159 --> 00:55:07,659
know it was very obvious in the mutants

1276
00:55:05,498 --> 00:55:10,718
that in two of the mutants of the

1277
00:55:07,659 --> 00:55:13,179
receptor kinases the the root hairs were

1278
00:55:10,719 --> 00:55:16,028
stunted which is also associated with

1279
00:55:13,179 --> 00:55:17,379
iron deficiency responses so but we

1280
00:55:16,028 --> 00:55:19,748
haven't looked in a systematic manner

1281
00:55:17,380 --> 00:55:23,229
because on those plate essays that we do

1282
00:55:19,748 --> 00:55:26,639
it's it's impossible to this two to get

1283
00:55:23,228 --> 00:55:26,639
the resolution for the root hairs

1284
00:55:31,659 --> 00:55:36,879
you could say so yes I mean like like

1285
00:55:35,530 --> 00:55:38,950
when there was like bigger growth

1286
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:41,920
inhibition observed in the in the mutant

1287
00:55:38,949 --> 00:55:43,779
the routier seem to be more screwed up

1288
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:45,130
but I I mean I know I mean I would

1289
00:55:43,780 --> 00:55:48,210
really need to look at it's it's very

1290
00:55:45,130 --> 00:55:51,010
anecdotal and that might be very biased

1291
00:55:48,210 --> 00:55:55,289
because the way how those things are

1292
00:55:51,010 --> 00:55:55,289
noticed are very biased typically

1293
00:56:00,579 --> 00:56:05,130
it does the factor that Connie

1294
00:56:12,380 --> 00:56:17,880
so my hypothesis is we haven't tested it

1295
00:56:15,599 --> 00:56:19,889
but I think it is there are a couple of

1296
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:21,720
polymorphisms in the coding region that

1297
00:56:19,889 --> 00:56:23,609
don't lead to changes in the minor acid

1298
00:56:21,719 --> 00:56:26,579
sequence I think achieve this will

1299
00:56:23,610 --> 00:56:29,280
relate to RNA stability there's also

1300
00:56:26,579 --> 00:56:32,190
this study where they over expressed Pro

1301
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:33,960
to with the 35s promoter under control

1302
00:56:32,190 --> 00:56:37,280
and iron conditions and even though the

1303
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:39,809
35s shouldn't be affected by the iron

1304
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:41,910
deficiency the expression level of pro 2

1305
00:56:39,809 --> 00:56:44,159
was still higher under iron deficiency

1306
00:56:41,909 --> 00:56:46,799
which would suggest a post

1307
00:56:44,159 --> 00:56:48,449
transcriptional regulation and and that

1308
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:51,000
would be in line with the polymorphisms

1309
00:56:48,449 --> 00:56:54,359
that we observe in the in the transcript

1310
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:59,179
but we haven't tested it but but then it

1311
00:56:54,360 --> 00:56:59,180
will be an RNA to an over factor somehow

1312
00:57:00,269 --> 00:57:07,130
and the great work there you know

1313
00:57:03,289 --> 00:57:09,559
thank you then I have one technical

1314
00:57:07,130 --> 00:57:12,450
question like Ethan

1315
00:57:09,559 --> 00:57:14,849
in our reductive

1316
00:57:12,449 --> 00:57:17,279
well under less than 400 micron

1317
00:57:14,849 --> 00:57:20,009
centaurum star the decision life and

1318
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:21,800
most people got them so this is what the

1319
00:57:20,010 --> 00:57:23,660
electrification work

1320
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:27,560
and the second question is in

1321
00:57:23,659 --> 00:57:30,230
agriculture most crowd

1322
00:57:27,559 --> 00:57:32,989
allocate problem to their background and

1323
00:57:30,230 --> 00:57:35,449
have an sort of Hoops would be a big

1324
00:57:32,989 --> 00:57:38,149
advantage for for for problems

1325
00:57:35,449 --> 00:57:41,769
so the function legged circus order is

1326
00:57:38,150 --> 00:57:41,769
very important like Thailand one

1327
00:57:43,260 --> 00:57:48,100
your main thing is the left that easy to

1328
00:57:45,940 --> 00:57:51,700
do but the function of the movie they're

1329
00:57:48,099 --> 00:57:54,130
very short very efficient absolutely I

1330
00:57:51,699 --> 00:57:56,019
mean I I fully agree I think the root

1331
00:57:54,130 --> 00:57:58,570
system architecture then at a later

1332
00:57:56,019 --> 00:58:01,630
stage will tell us a lot about you know

1333
00:57:58,570 --> 00:58:04,630
which soil layers can be explored how

1334
00:58:01,630 --> 00:58:06,070
efficient that they are for this I mean

1335
00:58:04,630 --> 00:58:08,470
we haven't really done this

1336
00:58:06,070 --> 00:58:11,110
systematically we would like to and I

1337
00:58:08,469 --> 00:58:14,949
think there are ways to look at later

1338
00:58:11,110 --> 00:58:18,010
root systems yeah so we would love to

1339
00:58:14,949 --> 00:58:19,329
think about this but and and we do as

1340
00:58:18,010 --> 00:58:21,370
far as we can but we really haven't

1341
00:58:19,329 --> 00:58:23,019
systematically studied later with

1342
00:58:21,369 --> 00:58:25,779
architecture and then the light

1343
00:58:23,019 --> 00:58:28,329
intensity I would need to look up how

1344
00:58:25,780 --> 00:58:31,150
many micro Einsteins are used what we

1345
00:58:28,329 --> 00:58:34,179
know is that we tests described mutants

1346
00:58:31,150 --> 00:58:38,289
for iron like the fro - mutant also the

1347
00:58:34,179 --> 00:58:41,799
IRT one that they basically whether we

1348
00:58:38,289 --> 00:58:43,449
can reproduce the effects that were that

1349
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:45,280
were described for them and under our

1350
00:58:43,449 --> 00:58:48,239
light conditions we actually recaptured

1351
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:52,170
relate the effects that were described

1352
00:58:48,239 --> 00:58:52,169
so yeah

1353
00:58:55,059 --> 00:59:00,269
