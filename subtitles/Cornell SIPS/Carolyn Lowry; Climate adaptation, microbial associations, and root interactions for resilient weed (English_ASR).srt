1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:04,759
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,400
University okay all right well thank you

3
00:00:09,039 --> 00:00:11,718
all so much for coming today and thank

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,440
you for that introduction and the

5
00:00:11,718 --> 00:00:16,118
invitation it's really exciting to be

6
00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:19,239
here um so I started at Penn State in

7
00:00:16,118 --> 00:00:21,320
January 2020 so I feel like I'm no

8
00:00:19,239 --> 00:00:23,799
longer allowed to say that I'm new I

9
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:27,000
feel like I'm leaving that world but um

10
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:29,039
I'm really excited to share some of the

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,719
work that my lab has been doing and so

12
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:34,320
all the work that you will see today has

13
00:00:31,719 --> 00:00:36,159
been done by my amazing lab group um

14
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,320
here's their picture I've been really

15
00:00:36,159 --> 00:00:39,718
fortunate since starting at a pen States

16
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,079
I've had some phenomenal graduate

17
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:42,359
students have been really lucky and I'm

18
00:00:41,079 --> 00:00:44,000
excited to be able to share some of

19
00:00:42,359 --> 00:00:45,519
their work with you so here are just

20
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,399
some of the themes that of research that

21
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,120
my lab is really interested in and I'll

22
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:50,280
be able to touch on all of these a

23
00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:52,599
little bit today so we're really

24
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:54,840
interested in thinking about how climate

25
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:57,520
change will affect weeds and the way

26
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:59,399
that we manage them um how um we can

27
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:01,320
leverage plant diversity to increase

28
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:04,680
ecosystem services and agricultural

29
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:07,719
systems um weed microbe interactions

30
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:10,400
which is a new area of research for me

31
00:01:07,719 --> 00:01:11,759
um but um when I started pen state had

32
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,280
um started their a huge microbiome

33
00:01:11,759 --> 00:01:15,319
Center and so it's been you know really

34
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,599
great to sort of Leverage that expertise

35
00:01:15,319 --> 00:01:18,079
um and then thinking about root traits

36
00:01:16,599 --> 00:01:21,039
and how plant compete with each other

37
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:22,319
below ground um so my talk today I'm

38
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,640
gonna have talk about three different

39
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:25,879
components of my research program um and

40
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,320
so the first one is going to be looking

41
00:01:25,879 --> 00:01:30,118
at whether or not we can leverage crop

42
00:01:27,319 --> 00:01:33,078
species or diversity to influence weed

43
00:01:30,118 --> 00:01:34,920
seed mortality in the soil um how will

44
00:01:33,078 --> 00:01:36,959
climate change affect weed seed bank

45
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:39,118
Dynamics um and then thinking about do

46
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:41,478
interspecific interactions influence the

47
00:01:39,118 --> 00:01:44,718
ways that plants um allocate carbon um

48
00:01:41,478 --> 00:01:47,039
above versus below ground um so when we

49
00:01:44,718 --> 00:01:48,959
talking about the first one right now um

50
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,840
so there's been a lot of interest in

51
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:53,959
thinking about how we can manage the

52
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:56,600
soil seed bang either by reducing weed

53
00:01:53,959 --> 00:01:58,319
seed rain and Seed inputs into the soil

54
00:01:56,599 --> 00:02:00,599
and then also accelerating seed

55
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:01,919
mortality and part of the reason that

56
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:04,038
people are really interested in managing

57
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:06,879
the soil seed bank is because most

58
00:02:04,039 --> 00:02:08,560
annual weeds in a cropping field come

59
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:10,840
from the soil seed bank the primary

60
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:13,239
source of Recruitment and so if we can

61
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:15,878
figure out ways to either reduce seed

62
00:02:13,239 --> 00:02:18,480
inputs into the soil or accelerate seed

63
00:02:15,878 --> 00:02:20,479
mortality once seeds enter the soil um

64
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:21,878
we might be able to really decrease the

65
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:24,159
sort of density of weeds that are

66
00:02:21,878 --> 00:02:25,878
emerging with our crops and so once a

67
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:27,959
seed enters their soil there's really

68
00:02:25,878 --> 00:02:30,239
three mechanisms by which a seed can die

69
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:34,319
the first is just natural physi iCal

70
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:36,800
aging the second um is seed predation or

71
00:02:34,318 --> 00:02:39,719
herbivory by things like mice or ants or

72
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:41,920
other insects birds um and then they

73
00:02:39,719 --> 00:02:43,439
also can be infected by soil microbes

74
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:45,679
and then

75
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:48,359
Decay um and so when we think about

76
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:50,519
these sort of two major modes of Bio

77
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:52,879
control of seeds in the soil seed bank

78
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:56,879
um seed predation or microbial infection

79
00:02:52,878 --> 00:02:59,359
and Decay we actually know so much more

80
00:02:56,878 --> 00:03:00,840
about the organisms that the herbivores

81
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,640
that consume consume weed seeds compared

82
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:04,598
to the microbes in the soil so this for

83
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:07,119
example this is a results from a web of

84
00:03:04,598 --> 00:03:09,119
science search that I did in March 2024

85
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:11,200
so exactly one year ago and just looking

86
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,799
at the number of articles that I found

87
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:15,679
that either talked about seed Predators

88
00:03:13,799 --> 00:03:18,239
um and the sort of management practices

89
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:20,519
that we can use to try to build up those

90
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:22,680
populations and um increase the number

91
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:24,719
of seeds that we're losing to predation

92
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:27,120
compared to microbes in the soil and as

93
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:28,840
you can see we really know much less

94
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:31,080
about micro um you know microbes in the

95
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:33,400
soil that can infect kill wheed seeds

96
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:36,760
compared to seed predators and I want to

97
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:39,360
say that also the vast majority of these

98
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:40,919
Publications came out prior to Next

99
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:43,439
Generation sequencing becoming like an

100
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:45,518
affordable tool um for people to use so

101
00:03:43,438 --> 00:03:47,239
really there's a lot of questions um

102
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:49,640
that we could ask sort of just thinking

103
00:03:47,239 --> 00:03:51,878
about how we can leverage microbes to

104
00:03:49,639 --> 00:03:53,759
accelerate seed mortality in the soil

105
00:03:51,878 --> 00:03:55,438
and when we think about doing that

106
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:57,399
there's really two strategies that we

107
00:03:55,438 --> 00:03:58,598
might be able to think about the first

108
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:00,640
is we can use something like an

109
00:03:58,598 --> 00:04:02,919
inoculant to supplement those

110
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:05,078
populations of microbes in the soil so

111
00:04:02,919 --> 00:04:07,759
adding microbes to the soil through

112
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:09,719
inoculations um or utilizing management

113
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:11,399
practices that may increase the

114
00:04:09,719 --> 00:04:13,639
abundance and activity of microbes that

115
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:15,000
may infect weed seeds in the soil and so

116
00:04:13,639 --> 00:04:16,719
my research really sort of Falls

117
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,639
underneath the second

118
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:21,160
category um and so the question that we

119
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:23,680
really wanted to ask was whether or not

120
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:25,400
we can leverage the plant Community to

121
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,519
affect rates of seed mortality in the

122
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:29,159
soil um and the reason why we wanted to

123
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:32,240
look at this is because the plants

124
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:34,759
themselves are one of if not the most

125
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:36,800
important levers that farmers have to

126
00:04:34,759 --> 00:04:38,680
sort of manage the microbial populations

127
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,000
in the soil and so we know there's been

128
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:42,720
research showing that the plant

129
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,079
Community can affect soil microbes we

130
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:48,160
know that soil microbes can affect weed

131
00:04:45,079 --> 00:04:50,478
seeds and accelerate mortality or and

132
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:52,479
and um cause seed mortality and so what

133
00:04:50,478 --> 00:04:54,879
we were trying to do is to really link

134
00:04:52,478 --> 00:04:56,399
these processes together and ask the

135
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:58,478
question whether or not we can use the

136
00:04:56,399 --> 00:05:01,359
plant Community to influence the soil

137
00:04:58,478 --> 00:05:04,159
microbiome and um infect uh and increase

138
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:06,000
um seed mortality um and so we decided

139
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:08,400
to do this research in a perennial

140
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,478
forage system and the reason why is

141
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:12,918
because perennial forages are a really

142
00:05:10,478 --> 00:05:15,079
important tool um to include our you

143
00:05:12,918 --> 00:05:16,959
know a component of crop rotations to

144
00:05:15,079 --> 00:05:19,120
break up weed life cycles of annual

145
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:21,638
weeds and so during this time you have

146
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:23,759
this sort of consistent ground cover um

147
00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:26,000
that really suppresses any new weeds

148
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:27,720
from emerging and also the frequent

149
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,720
cutting that they do each time that they

150
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:32,440
harvest a penal forage the that frequent

151
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,479
cutting can sort of um terminate any

152
00:05:32,439 --> 00:05:36,918
annual weeds that did emerge thereby

153
00:05:34,478 --> 00:05:39,159
reducing new weed seed inputs into the

154
00:05:36,918 --> 00:05:40,918
soil um so we decided to do this in a

155
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:43,319
perennial forage system and we actually

156
00:05:40,918 --> 00:05:45,839
created a perennial forage diversity

157
00:05:43,319 --> 00:05:48,560
gradient so we had Alfalfa which is a

158
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:50,318
perennial legume um Orchard Grass which

159
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,959
is a perennial grass and I would say

160
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:55,319
that an alfalfa Orchard Grass mixture is

161
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:56,839
one of if not the um most common

162
00:05:55,319 --> 00:05:58,759
perennial forages that farmers at least

163
00:05:56,839 --> 00:06:00,879
in Pennsylvania are growing and then

164
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:03,800
with that we also included this um

165
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:06,478
forage chory um which is a a

166
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:09,079
non-luminous forb and the reason why we

167
00:06:06,478 --> 00:06:12,079
selected chory was because it's really

168
00:06:09,079 --> 00:06:14,240
the only perennial forage that is not a

169
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:17,000
legum or a grass that you know is really

170
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:19,000
um available to Farmers at this time um

171
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,360
and so we set up a diversity gradient

172
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,399
where we had each of them in monoculture

173
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,919
all combinations of the two species

174
00:06:23,399 --> 00:06:28,120
mixtures um and then the three species

175
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:30,359
mixture and we had that replicated four

176
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:32,000
times and so what we did in each of

177
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:34,840
these plots where we had our perennial

178
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:37,038
forge community is we buried weed seeds

179
00:06:34,839 --> 00:06:38,638
in these small bags um in various

180
00:06:37,038 --> 00:06:41,399
locations throughout each plot and these

181
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:44,120
were buried shortly after planting in

182
00:06:41,399 --> 00:06:46,198
2021 and then we had um multiple

183
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:48,360
extraction time points so one year after

184
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:49,639
burial one and a half years two years

185
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:52,400
and then two and a half years after

186
00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:54,840
burial and so what we did is once we

187
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:58,359
extracted these seeds so we extracted

188
00:06:54,839 --> 00:07:00,198
two bags each time Point um and then we

189
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:02,199
pulled those bags together

190
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:03,800
we wash the seeds in the soil through a

191
00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:06,520
series of sives so that we could collect

192
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:08,759
the seeds and then we immediately spit

193
00:07:06,519 --> 00:07:12,279
um split that population or that sample

194
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:13,800
of seeds into two batches half went for

195
00:07:12,279 --> 00:07:16,119
aluminous sequencing so that we could

196
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:17,918
characterize the microbial community and

197
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:20,240
half we did viability testing with

198
00:07:17,918 --> 00:07:22,560
tetrazolium

199
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,439
assays um and so in order to for our

200
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,280
amplion sequencing what we did is we

201
00:07:24,439 --> 00:07:28,038
what we first did is we sterilized the

202
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:29,598
surface of the seeds because we really

203
00:07:28,038 --> 00:07:32,519
want to know what microbes were getting

204
00:07:29,598 --> 00:07:35,360
inside the seed um we extracted the DNA

205
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:37,038
and then we used um 16s RNA to

206
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,960
characterize uh Universal primers to

207
00:07:37,038 --> 00:07:40,759
characterize the bacterial community and

208
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:42,279
then its that characterize the fungal

209
00:07:40,759 --> 00:07:44,759
Community I'm only going to be

210
00:07:42,279 --> 00:07:46,519
presenting on the results from on the

211
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:50,520
bacterial Community

212
00:07:46,519 --> 00:07:53,560
today and so our primary hypothesis was

213
00:07:50,519 --> 00:07:55,639
that a more diverse plant Community

214
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:58,280
would um support a more diverse

215
00:07:55,639 --> 00:08:00,639
microbial community and that in doing so

216
00:07:58,279 --> 00:08:03,399
we might get sort of accelerated

217
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:05,280
mortality in the soil underneath these

218
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:06,878
you know more diverse mixtures so you

219
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:09,439
know if you think about like viability

220
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:11,680
on the um Y axis here we'd have greater

221
00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:14,478
loss of viability in these more diverse

222
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:16,199
communities um so I will say that was

223
00:08:14,478 --> 00:08:19,439
not the case so here what we're looking

224
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:21,080
at is um uh Powell amaranth which is a

225
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:23,959
pigweed species it's sort of a common

226
00:08:21,079 --> 00:08:26,120
pigweed species um in Pennsylvania and

227
00:08:23,959 --> 00:08:28,478
all of the data that I'm going to show

228
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:30,800
you today is going to be um on Powell

229
00:08:28,478 --> 00:08:34,000
amaranth seed and so this is looking at

230
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:36,959
our um mortality so uh is on the y- axis

231
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,440
here so the more the greater the bar the

232
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:41,439
more dead the seeds were um and then we

233
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:44,480
have our um seven different treatments

234
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:46,640
here so we really found no consistent

235
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:49,440
effect of treatment on sea mortality we

236
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:52,199
saw a trend um in the second year for

237
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,680
the monocultures have actually having um

238
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:56,278
greater mortality so sort of

239
00:08:53,679 --> 00:08:58,759
inconsistent with our hypothesis um but

240
00:08:56,278 --> 00:09:00,039
we really like did not find a huge

241
00:08:58,759 --> 00:09:02,919
effective treatment on our seed

242
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:04,559
mortality and then what we also expected

243
00:09:02,919 --> 00:09:07,000
is that when we looked at the bacterial

244
00:09:04,559 --> 00:09:08,919
communities within the seeds that we

245
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,200
might see the um you know the

246
00:09:08,919 --> 00:09:13,599
monocultures sort of separating out so

247
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:15,680
having different bacterial communities

248
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:17,278
in the seeds that were buried in those

249
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:19,120
monoculture treatments and then maybe

250
00:09:17,278 --> 00:09:24,240
the mixture would be sort of some

251
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:26,639
intermediary between them um and so and

252
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:28,720
um again we actually really didn't find

253
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:30,199
much of an effect of treatment on the

254
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,120
mic uh material community that was

255
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:34,320
inside the seeds so this is results from

256
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:36,679
a principal coordinate analysis and so

257
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:38,760
the closer the PO um points are in this

258
00:09:36,679 --> 00:09:40,759
ordination the more similar those

259
00:09:38,759 --> 00:09:43,078
bacterial communities are and so we

260
00:09:40,759 --> 00:09:45,519
really found no effect of our perennial

261
00:09:43,078 --> 00:09:47,078
Forge treatments on the bacterial

262
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:48,639
communities that were getting inside

263
00:09:47,078 --> 00:09:50,958
these pow amaran

264
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:53,000
seeds all right so I know you guys are

265
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:55,919
thinking did these people find anything

266
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,919
interesting well yes we actually did so

267
00:09:55,919 --> 00:10:00,519
the data that I'm about to present to

268
00:09:57,919 --> 00:10:03,360
you um is really like everything that

269
00:10:00,519 --> 00:10:05,240
you would expect to happen to a seed

270
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,278
once it enters the soil but we really

271
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:09,320
have had so little work done on this so

272
00:10:07,278 --> 00:10:11,720
it is sort of like exciting um to sort

273
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:14,040
of have have this confirmed so one thing

274
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:16,639
that we did find is that the bacterial

275
00:10:14,039 --> 00:10:19,078
communities within our seeds actually

276
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:20,919
differed over time so again this is a

277
00:10:19,078 --> 00:10:22,439
principal coordinate analysis the more

278
00:10:20,919 --> 00:10:24,439
similar the points the more similar the

279
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:26,519
bacterial communities this was our

280
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:28,440
original population so this is the

281
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:30,600
bacterial Community the endic community

282
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:33,160
that was inside the SE seeds prior to

283
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:35,120
the seeds ever entering the soil um and

284
00:10:33,159 --> 00:10:37,360
then you can see so here is one year

285
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:39,278
burial one and a half year then after

286
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:41,079
two and uh two and two and a half years

287
00:10:39,278 --> 00:10:43,600
the communities kind of became more

288
00:10:41,078 --> 00:10:45,399
stagnant and um stopped changing but we

289
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,800
did see this sort of like variation in

290
00:10:45,399 --> 00:10:49,078
these bacterial communities over time

291
00:10:47,799 --> 00:10:51,159
and then another thing that we saw is

292
00:10:49,078 --> 00:10:53,078
that the diversity of bacteria Within

293
00:10:51,159 --> 00:10:55,559
These um seeds actually tended to

294
00:10:53,078 --> 00:10:59,479
increase over time so these are three

295
00:10:55,559 --> 00:11:01,239
different metrics of um of diversity so

296
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:02,800
c one or chaan is basically sort of

297
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:05,120
similar to richness and then we have

298
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:07,359
Shannon and Simpson diversity and so the

299
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:09,240
zero is the seeds that were never buried

300
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:11,240
in the soil you can kind of see we see

301
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:12,639
this like trend of increasing diversity

302
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:15,879
of the bacterial communities in the

303
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:18,039
seeds over time um and then another

304
00:11:15,879 --> 00:11:22,120
thing that we saw was that we actually

305
00:11:18,039 --> 00:11:24,958
saw that in the samples that had low um

306
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:27,039
mortality and high mortality that the

307
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:29,039
bacterial communities actually differed

308
00:11:27,039 --> 00:11:30,958
between them so what we did is we sort

309
00:11:29,039 --> 00:11:32,480
of you know we classify for each sample

310
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:34,599
we classified the sort of percent

311
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:36,800
mortality of the seeds of each sample

312
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:39,800
and then we classified them so low was

313
00:11:36,799 --> 00:11:43,159
less than 33% mortality medium mortality

314
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:46,519
was 33 to 66% and high mortality was

315
00:11:43,159 --> 00:11:49,838
above 66% so as you could see the yellow

316
00:11:46,519 --> 00:11:51,879
and the dark blue so is low um yeah low

317
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:53,839
and high and so we saw this sort of like

318
00:11:51,879 --> 00:11:55,519
difference in the community of seeds

319
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:57,639
that had greater mortality compared to

320
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:59,039
those that had low mortality um so you

321
00:11:57,639 --> 00:12:01,000
know this was pretty interesting and so

322
00:11:59,039 --> 00:12:03,278
when we looked at sort of the different

323
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,559
bacterial Genera that might be causing

324
00:12:03,278 --> 00:12:07,480
this there were a few that we saw sort

325
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:10,239
of like an increase in their relative

326
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:12,600
abundance um as the seeds tended to go

327
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:14,399
towards higher mortality so this really

328
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:16,680
sort of sets up some future you know

329
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:19,399
hypothesis testing of whether or not we

330
00:12:16,679 --> 00:12:21,799
can actually sort of um test whether or

331
00:12:19,399 --> 00:12:25,519
not these um specific microbes in the

332
00:12:21,799 --> 00:12:27,958
soil can actually help accelerate rtin

333
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:29,600
mortality um yeah and so then here what

334
00:12:27,958 --> 00:12:31,679
we're looking at is just our first axis

335
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:33,879
of our principal coordinate analysis and

336
00:12:31,679 --> 00:12:36,638
on the Y AIS we have the percent

337
00:12:33,879 --> 00:12:38,480
mortality in our pow amaran seeds so we

338
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:40,560
did see you know some association with

339
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:42,440
our bacterial Community um sort of

340
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:44,198
predicting the mortality of those

341
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:46,199
seeds however the one thing I really

342
00:12:44,198 --> 00:12:48,958
want to point out is what we can't say

343
00:12:46,198 --> 00:12:51,120
is like which came first was the seed

344
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:52,919
dead and then these microbes moved in

345
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:55,399
these bacteria moved in or did the

346
00:12:52,919 --> 00:12:57,240
bacteria move in and then the the seeds

347
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:59,799
died and so you know future work really

348
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:01,680
need to sort of be um be up to sort of

349
00:12:59,799 --> 00:13:03,599
test whether or not we can actually say

350
00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:06,000
whether or not these specific bacteria

351
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:08,399
are sort of helping to induce mortality

352
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,759
of these seeds so you know and sort of

353
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:11,679
thinking about how we might be able to

354
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:13,519
leverage seed microbiomes to accelerate

355
00:13:11,679 --> 00:13:15,039
seed mortality in the soil I think we

356
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:16,480
have a long way to go and you know in

357
00:13:15,039 --> 00:13:18,519
order to get there we really need to

358
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:21,159
establish some causal links between

359
00:13:18,519 --> 00:13:23,159
specific microbial populations um and

360
00:13:21,159 --> 00:13:24,719
their communities and Seed mortality as

361
00:13:23,159 --> 00:13:26,879
well as you know hopefully determined

362
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:29,199
management practices that can help

363
00:13:26,879 --> 00:13:30,919
increase both the the abundance and

364
00:13:29,198 --> 00:13:33,319
activity of these microbial populations

365
00:13:30,919 --> 00:13:35,439
within the soil and our results suggest

366
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:37,800
that you know using uh altering the

367
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:40,160
forge plant community may not be an

368
00:13:37,799 --> 00:13:42,240
effective strategy to get

369
00:13:40,159 --> 00:13:43,759
there okay so now I'm moving into my

370
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:46,240
second portion of my talk thinking about

371
00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:48,519
how climate change will affect weed seed

372
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,680
um seed bank Dynamics and I'm going to

373
00:13:48,519 --> 00:13:51,600
actually talk about two different

374
00:13:49,679 --> 00:13:53,879
components of our research one looking

375
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:56,120
at how um increasing temperatures affect

376
00:13:53,879 --> 00:13:59,078
weed seed persistence in the soil and

377
00:13:56,120 --> 00:14:01,639
the second looking at how um how warmer

378
00:13:59,078 --> 00:14:04,519
Tempur can affect weed emergence timing

379
00:14:01,639 --> 00:14:07,278
in both of these studies my lab uses

380
00:14:04,519 --> 00:14:10,039
these open top Chambers to passively

381
00:14:07,278 --> 00:14:12,078
increase temperatures out in the field

382
00:14:10,039 --> 00:14:13,919
um they're commonly used in sort of like

383
00:14:12,078 --> 00:14:15,838
climate change research in the Arctic

384
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:17,879
and so we've um been able to adapt them

385
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:20,079
more for like an agricultural setting um

386
00:14:17,879 --> 00:14:21,399
to try to sort of to uh passively

387
00:14:20,078 --> 00:14:23,958
increase temperatures when we're out in

388
00:14:21,399 --> 00:14:26,480
the field um and so we know that

389
00:14:23,958 --> 00:14:29,159
temperatures are increasing right and so

390
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:31,560
there's a lot of reasons to think why

391
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:34,360
why warmer temperatures might cause

392
00:14:31,559 --> 00:14:37,439
weeds to become less persistent in the

393
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:39,000
soil so for example we know that seeds

394
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,880
you know stored at room temperature are

395
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,120
going to have a a shorter shelf life

396
00:14:40,879 --> 00:14:45,240
than seeds that you put in um in the

397
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,919
fridge or you know in 4 degrees Celsius

398
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:48,560
so there's a lot of reasons to think

399
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:50,399
that warmer temperatures will actually

400
00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:52,599
decrease the persist persistence you

401
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:54,639
know warmer temp soil temperatures often

402
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:56,720
result in increase microbial activity so

403
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:59,320
you might have greater sort of seed

404
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:02,199
infection um they can increase seed seed

405
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:04,440
respiration rates thereby causing seeds

406
00:15:02,198 --> 00:15:06,719
to draw down on their reserves in a

407
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:09,199
shorter period of time um and then

408
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:11,079
potentially changes to Free Soil free

409
00:15:09,198 --> 00:15:13,719
Tha cycles that could come from

410
00:15:11,078 --> 00:15:15,758
decreased snow cover might fracture seed

411
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:17,879
coats and and leave seeds more

412
00:15:15,759 --> 00:15:19,839
vulnerable and so there's this common

413
00:15:17,879 --> 00:15:23,720
saying that maybe you've heard like one

414
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:25,480
years seeding equals seven years weeding

415
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:27,160
so really what we're trying to ask here

416
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:28,319
is maybe with maybe climate change you

417
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:30,078
know there might be some good things

418
00:15:28,318 --> 00:15:32,799
that come from climate change and maybe

419
00:15:30,078 --> 00:15:36,439
one year seeding will actually be equal

420
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:39,399
five years weeding in the future um and

421
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:41,240
so to do this this is work done um by my

422
00:15:39,399 --> 00:15:42,919
graduate uh former Master student Ashley

423
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:46,159
isacson who's now an extension educator

424
00:15:42,919 --> 00:15:48,039
in Pennsylvania and so she um um

425
00:15:46,159 --> 00:15:50,519
compared two treatments a control so

426
00:15:48,039 --> 00:15:51,838
that's no open top chamber and then with

427
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:55,198
the open top

428
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:56,880
chamber um and she was um evaluating the

429
00:15:55,198 --> 00:15:59,240
Persistence of three different weed

430
00:15:56,879 --> 00:16:01,879
species so red root Pig weed common

431
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:04,839
Ragweed and large crab grass and so

432
00:16:01,879 --> 00:16:07,799
essentially what Ashley did is she um

433
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:10,160
extracted soil clores from the small one

434
00:16:07,799 --> 00:16:14,599
meter squared plots and within each of

435
00:16:10,159 --> 00:16:17,439
these soil cores she um spiked like 500

436
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:20,159
seeds of her um species of interest and

437
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:21,720
the reason why we chose to do this

438
00:16:20,159 --> 00:16:23,879
method which is called the seated core

439
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:26,160
method is because I was really sort of

440
00:16:23,879 --> 00:16:28,519
initially interested in sort of like how

441
00:16:26,159 --> 00:16:30,838
decreased snow cover might change soil

442
00:16:28,519 --> 00:16:33,560
physically properties and so I wanted to

443
00:16:30,839 --> 00:16:36,000
have the seeds to be um in as much of a

444
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:37,838
realistic environment as possible which

445
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,639
is why we did not use those little bags

446
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:41,120
that I showed you previously and we

447
00:16:39,639 --> 00:16:43,879
actually decided to just like directly

448
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:45,919
Spike the soil um and so we marked them

449
00:16:43,879 --> 00:16:48,919
with these little uh sort of landscape

450
00:16:45,919 --> 00:16:50,278
fa fabric Staples with tags um to do

451
00:16:48,919 --> 00:16:52,519
that and then we oh and then we

452
00:16:50,278 --> 00:16:54,120
extracted at three different points I

453
00:16:52,519 --> 00:16:56,039
think they were about six months apart

454
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:58,639
over an 18mon

455
00:16:56,039 --> 00:17:02,879
period um okay so now what we're looking

456
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:06,160
at is how much warming we got from our

457
00:17:02,879 --> 00:17:08,679
OTC so the the Y AIS here is the

458
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:12,519
difference in temperature in Celsius in

459
00:17:08,679 --> 00:17:15,679
the OTC compared to the control so on

460
00:17:12,519 --> 00:17:17,519
average we are only getting a about a

461
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:19,160
half degree celsius increase in

462
00:17:17,519 --> 00:17:22,000
temperature so for with this study we

463
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:23,798
only got a 04 degrees Celsius increase

464
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:27,558
in temperature and I want to point out

465
00:17:23,798 --> 00:17:30,558
to you that some months we actually had

466
00:17:27,558 --> 00:17:32,519
cooler temperatures in our otc's

467
00:17:30,558 --> 00:17:34,279
compared to the control and the reason

468
00:17:32,519 --> 00:17:35,960
why is because we once again did this in

469
00:17:34,279 --> 00:17:38,759
a perennial Forge field so we're kind of

470
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:40,640
trying to like simulate um what would

471
00:17:38,759 --> 00:17:43,200
happen to seeds during The Perennial

472
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:45,320
phase of their crop rotation and so we

473
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:47,440
had an alala orchard grass mixture in

474
00:17:45,319 --> 00:17:50,079
here and so what ended up happening is

475
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:53,240
we actually had in these months much

476
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:55,599
greater productivity of the um alalal

477
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:57,480
orch grass mixture in the otc's compared

478
00:17:55,599 --> 00:17:59,678
to the control so we think we actually

479
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:01,558
got cooler temperature is from like EV

480
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:03,559
vapo transfer of cooling maybe greater

481
00:18:01,558 --> 00:18:04,960
shading and there's a sort of a number

482
00:18:03,558 --> 00:18:07,558
of reasons so because we had like

483
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:09,558
greater productivity in those otcs we

484
00:18:07,558 --> 00:18:11,359
actually saw um a decrease in

485
00:18:09,558 --> 00:18:13,200
temperature underneath them but anyway

486
00:18:11,359 --> 00:18:15,719
so this would be like very you know

487
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:18,279
indicative of very near warming or very

488
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:19,720
you know very near future essentially

489
00:18:18,279 --> 00:18:22,359
and so looking at our results so here

490
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:24,839
the Y AIS is actually seed viability so

491
00:18:22,359 --> 00:18:26,639
the lower is the more seeds were dead

492
00:18:24,839 --> 00:18:28,439
and so we actually for two of our

493
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:30,600
species common Ragweed and large crab

494
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:33,558
grass we saw no um statistically

495
00:18:30,599 --> 00:18:37,199
significant effect we did see a small

496
00:18:33,558 --> 00:18:39,079
but um significant um acceleration of

497
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:41,440
mortality so loss of viability in our

498
00:18:39,079 --> 00:18:45,000
warming for red root pigy but again it

499
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:45,960
was just like a very minor difference so

500
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,159
you know this was kind of like

501
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:49,840
unexpected for us we really like

502
00:18:48,159 --> 00:18:52,520
expected that we would see sort of

503
00:18:49,839 --> 00:18:54,240
Greater loss of mortality um you know

504
00:18:52,519 --> 00:18:56,038
more accelerated mortality with with our

505
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:58,038
warming treatments and so some of the

506
00:18:56,038 --> 00:19:01,038
reasons maybe why we didn't see that is

507
00:18:58,038 --> 00:19:02,440
that seated core method that we used um

508
00:19:01,038 --> 00:19:05,200
is actually pretty variable because

509
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:06,960
there was already some natural um sort

510
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:08,360
of populations of those seeds in the

511
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:10,440
soil that we spiked and so that just

512
00:19:08,359 --> 00:19:12,918
created variability in the data and on

513
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:14,759
top of that maybe we just need a greater

514
00:19:12,919 --> 00:19:16,759
increase in temperature to actually see

515
00:19:14,759 --> 00:19:18,640
more of an effect so maybe in the future

516
00:19:16,759 --> 00:19:21,000
using something like soil heating cables

517
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:22,799
you might be able to um see more of an

518
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,038
effect um but those are really

519
00:19:22,798 --> 00:19:25,759
challenging you to like find an

520
00:19:24,038 --> 00:19:27,319
electrical source out in the field so

521
00:19:25,759 --> 00:19:29,079
there's all types of challenges when you

522
00:19:27,319 --> 00:19:31,279
actually like are trying to pump

523
00:19:29,079 --> 00:19:35,279
electricity out into your field and that

524
00:19:31,279 --> 00:19:36,720
is like you know uh way above my um

525
00:19:35,279 --> 00:19:38,839
assistant professor pay rade at this

526
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:40,400
point in time but I'm hoping you know in

527
00:19:38,839 --> 00:19:43,319
the future maybe doing things like that

528
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:45,000
would be um more feasible so the second

529
00:19:43,319 --> 00:19:46,918
question that we asked is how will

530
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,480
increased temperatures affect um weed

531
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:52,038
emergence timeing so this is um research

532
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:54,360
done by a PhD candidate in my group N

533
00:19:52,038 --> 00:19:56,079
Cala and so we were really interested in

534
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:58,119
sort of thinking about how climate

535
00:19:56,079 --> 00:19:59,678
change might affect emergence timing

536
00:19:58,119 --> 00:20:01,439
because under understanding when weeds

537
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:03,759
emerge can be really important for

538
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:05,558
trying to adequately T um time

539
00:20:03,759 --> 00:20:06,960
management activities so you really want

540
00:20:05,558 --> 00:20:09,279
to you know if you're doing any type of

541
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:11,759
like post emergent weed control you want

542
00:20:09,279 --> 00:20:14,319
to wait until you have you know a decent

543
00:20:11,759 --> 00:20:16,359
flush of weeds so that you're timing it

544
00:20:14,319 --> 00:20:17,639
to have the most efficacy but you also

545
00:20:16,359 --> 00:20:20,000
need to hit the weeds before they get

546
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:21,559
too big so understanding that when they

547
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,640
um emerge can really sort of help

548
00:20:21,558 --> 00:20:27,200
balance those trade-offs um and so again

549
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:29,120
so he used um with an O his treatments

550
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:31,319
were with an OTC and without but this

551
00:20:29,119 --> 00:20:33,839
time we were not in any perennial forage

552
00:20:31,319 --> 00:20:35,879
system we were just in bare soil so

553
00:20:33,839 --> 00:20:36,678
looking at his results um so this is

554
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:40,520
from

555
00:20:36,679 --> 00:20:41,960
20123 and this is days to 10% emergence

556
00:20:40,519 --> 00:20:45,079
so as you can see our results were

557
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:47,519
pretty variable so we had two species um

558
00:20:45,079 --> 00:20:48,839
giant fox tail oh so the red is warming

559
00:20:47,519 --> 00:20:50,759
and the blue is controlled sorry I

560
00:20:48,839 --> 00:20:54,000
should have said that um and then the

561
00:20:50,759 --> 00:20:56,000
the axis here is days to 10% emergence

562
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,038
um and so we had two species where we

563
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,440
had no sort of significant difference

564
00:20:58,038 --> 00:21:03,640
and then we had two species so Lamb's

565
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:06,840
quarters and large crab gas where we had

566
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:10,320
more days till we hit 10% emergence and

567
00:21:06,839 --> 00:21:12,240
then we had two species where we had um

568
00:21:10,319 --> 00:21:14,399
a lower amount of days till we hit that

569
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:15,960
10% emergence so really sort of you know

570
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,000
some species were responding to this

571
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:19,120
warming temperature but they were

572
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:22,159
responding in different ways and not all

573
00:21:19,119 --> 00:21:26,038
species were responding um the same now

574
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:28,760
in 2024 so this past year we actually

575
00:21:26,038 --> 00:21:30,599
found that the two species that we had

576
00:21:28,759 --> 00:21:32,919
no significant effect of in the first

577
00:21:30,599 --> 00:21:34,359
year we actually so like it could the

578
00:21:32,919 --> 00:21:35,880
results could not have been more

579
00:21:34,359 --> 00:21:37,278
variable that's what I'm trying to say

580
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:39,000
so here in this year we actually had

581
00:21:37,278 --> 00:21:40,319
giant Fox taale and red pige that we

582
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,599
found statistical differences between

583
00:21:40,319 --> 00:21:45,399
the warming and control um giant fox

584
00:21:42,599 --> 00:21:47,558
tail had greater um time to uh hitting

585
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:49,120
this time we're looking at 50% emergence

586
00:21:47,558 --> 00:21:51,240
and then red pig weed actually had a

587
00:21:49,119 --> 00:21:54,038
lower number of days until it hit 50%

588
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:55,759
emergence so again you know it's really

589
00:21:54,038 --> 00:21:57,798
really really sort of variable results

590
00:21:55,759 --> 00:21:59,640
that we've found this is often the case

591
00:21:57,798 --> 00:22:02,558
when people are trying to understand how

592
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:05,600
shifts in temperature or precipitation

593
00:22:02,558 --> 00:22:07,759
might um affect plant communities um and

594
00:22:05,599 --> 00:22:10,278
it can be really hard to make any like

595
00:22:07,759 --> 00:22:11,759
actual recommendations to Farmers um

596
00:22:10,278 --> 00:22:14,319
when your results are just like so

597
00:22:11,759 --> 00:22:16,558
variable um but I'm really excited so we

598
00:22:14,319 --> 00:22:19,158
will be starting a much larger project

599
00:22:16,558 --> 00:22:20,759
where multiple sites including Cornell

600
00:22:19,159 --> 00:22:22,919
um Tony's group at Cornell will be

601
00:22:20,759 --> 00:22:24,640
looking at how I mean this increasing

602
00:22:22,919 --> 00:22:27,038
temperatures with otcs can affect weed

603
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:29,240
emergence timing and hopefully by

604
00:22:27,038 --> 00:22:32,158
increasing the environmental Vari

605
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:34,798
maybe we'll be able to find some um sort

606
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:36,600
of like you know Universal principle or

607
00:22:34,798 --> 00:22:38,400
maybe we'll just have lots of more

608
00:22:36,599 --> 00:22:41,798
variable results and try to make some

609
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:43,880
sense of them okay so the last portion

610
00:22:41,798 --> 00:22:45,720
of my talk um is looking at whether or

611
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:48,679
not interp specific interactions can

612
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:50,159
influence how plants um allocate carbon

613
00:22:48,679 --> 00:22:51,679
and so when I started at Penn State I

614
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:53,880
was really interested in sort of

615
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:55,720
studying belowground competition sort

616
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:58,679
thinking about you know how plants are

617
00:22:55,720 --> 00:23:01,319
competing for resources below ground um

618
00:22:58,679 --> 00:23:03,278
however our ability to study um

619
00:23:01,319 --> 00:23:06,158
belowground competition is really

620
00:23:03,278 --> 00:23:08,519
limited by our lack of ability to

621
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:12,679
identify roots to species so if you're

622
00:23:08,519 --> 00:23:14,798
trying to assess how competition or

623
00:23:12,679 --> 00:23:17,440
other plantplant interactions affect a

624
00:23:14,798 --> 00:23:19,639
specific species often what you do you

625
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:22,000
use as your metric is biomass right like

626
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:23,640
plant biomass um but normally what

627
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,200
people do is they just harvest the above

628
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:27,080
ground portion of you know the plant

629
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,919
Community they separate plants to

630
00:23:27,079 --> 00:23:30,599
species and you know often they just

631
00:23:28,919 --> 00:23:33,400
sort of ignore what's happening below

632
00:23:30,599 --> 00:23:35,798
ground um and again that's because you

633
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:37,840
know roots are just hard to work with

634
00:23:35,798 --> 00:23:39,278
regardless you know it's pretty you know

635
00:23:37,839 --> 00:23:40,639
pretty difficult to be able to identify

636
00:23:39,278 --> 00:23:43,319
roots to

637
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:45,520
species however being able to have a

638
00:23:43,319 --> 00:23:47,759
method that we can sort of reliably

639
00:23:45,519 --> 00:23:49,240
estimate root biomass of individual

640
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:51,519
species when they're in these diverse

641
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:53,839
communities could really help answer

642
00:23:51,519 --> 00:23:56,440
sort of fundamental questions about how

643
00:23:53,839 --> 00:23:57,599
competition can affect productivity you

644
00:23:56,440 --> 00:24:00,080
know competition for belowground

645
00:23:57,599 --> 00:24:01,639
resources as well as what specific root

646
00:24:00,079 --> 00:24:04,240
traits can influence a plant's

647
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:07,360
competitive ability um and then

648
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:09,599
Additionally you know many of our like

649
00:24:07,359 --> 00:24:11,798
ecosystem services that we want from our

650
00:24:09,599 --> 00:24:14,719
crops many of those ecosystem services

651
00:24:11,798 --> 00:24:17,759
are tied to you know tied to Roots so

652
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:19,200
for example nitrogen retention um carbon

653
00:24:17,759 --> 00:24:21,038
storage so you know some Studies have

654
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,919
shown that that carbon drive from root

655
00:24:21,038 --> 00:24:25,278
tissue actually lasts is more persistent

656
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:27,159
in the soil compared to um Leaf tissue

657
00:24:25,278 --> 00:24:29,480
and then also obviously nitrogen

658
00:24:27,159 --> 00:24:30,840
fixation um so we were sort of really

659
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:32,798
interested in thinking about whether or

660
00:24:30,839 --> 00:24:35,439
not we could develop a method method to

661
00:24:32,798 --> 00:24:38,879
sort of identify or estimate the biomass

662
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:40,960
of individual species um in root biomass

663
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:43,000
diverse communities um and so this was

664
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:45,480
work done by a PhD candidate with my

665
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,798
group Emma rice um and so her research

666
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:48,919
questions was whether or not we can use

667
00:24:46,798 --> 00:24:50,519
Next Generation sequencing to predict

668
00:24:48,919 --> 00:24:53,480
the abundance of different species in

669
00:24:50,519 --> 00:24:55,879
root biomass um and do cover crop and

670
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:58,558
asking do cover crop species alter their

671
00:24:55,880 --> 00:25:00,640
allocation to above versus below ground

672
00:24:58,558 --> 00:25:02,319
um Roots versus shoots when in mixtures

673
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:03,480
compared to monocultures and you know

674
00:25:02,319 --> 00:25:05,558
now that there's sort of like all these

675
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:08,399
carbon markets being developed you know

676
00:25:05,558 --> 00:25:10,038
trying to estimate how the abundance of

677
00:25:08,398 --> 00:25:12,119
you know different species and how might

678
00:25:10,038 --> 00:25:13,919
that influence sort of Persistence of

679
00:25:12,119 --> 00:25:18,038
caret in the soil you know could be a

680
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:19,919
really valuable use of this tool um so

681
00:25:18,038 --> 00:25:22,038
um so Emma asked this question in this

682
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:23,840
long-term cover crop diversity

683
00:25:22,038 --> 00:25:27,200
experiment um at Penn State it's called

684
00:25:23,839 --> 00:25:29,119
our cover crop cocktails experiment um

685
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:31,000
and she had four different cover crop

686
00:25:29,119 --> 00:25:33,839
species that she was looking at crimson

687
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:36,278
clover winter pea tril and canola in

688
00:25:33,839 --> 00:25:39,158
monocultures and then a four species

689
00:25:36,278 --> 00:25:41,759
mixture and so what Emma did was she

690
00:25:39,159 --> 00:25:44,320
would extract root cores from the soil

691
00:25:41,759 --> 00:25:46,000
we would go down to 40 cmers we tried to

692
00:25:44,319 --> 00:25:48,558
go down to 50 and we just hit rocks

693
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,200
non-stop so 40 was the best we could do

694
00:25:48,558 --> 00:25:51,278
um I know if we were in deeper you know

695
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:53,319
if we were out in the midwest we could

696
00:25:51,278 --> 00:25:55,000
go to a meter de deep but so she would

697
00:25:53,319 --> 00:25:57,038
extract these soil cores she would clean

698
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:59,519
the roots from the soil she would freeze

699
00:25:57,038 --> 00:26:02,158
dry them and so then she would use the

700
00:25:59,519 --> 00:26:03,679
root biomass from the monocultures to

701
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:05,679
create all of these what we call her

702
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:08,840
mock mixtures where she was sort of

703
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:11,159
using fine scale um bearing the

704
00:26:08,839 --> 00:26:14,519
proportion of each of her species in

705
00:26:11,159 --> 00:26:15,760
these sort of microen auge tubes um and

706
00:26:14,519 --> 00:26:18,398
so we would use that to sort of

707
00:26:15,759 --> 00:26:22,278
calibrate the method she would extract

708
00:26:18,398 --> 00:26:24,519
the DNA and then we use um Universal

709
00:26:22,278 --> 00:26:27,359
primers for the rbcl which is a

710
00:26:24,519 --> 00:26:29,038
chloroplast Gene it's one of the genes

711
00:26:27,359 --> 00:26:30,678
that is often used in METAR

712
00:26:29,038 --> 00:26:32,720
metabarcoding for plants they often use

713
00:26:30,679 --> 00:26:35,679
the chloroplast genes um we tried

714
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:37,319
multiple chloroplast genes and rbcl was

715
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:39,200
the only one that we could work get to

716
00:26:37,319 --> 00:26:41,798
work reliably um and then she would

717
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:44,080
submit that for aluminous sequencing and

718
00:26:41,798 --> 00:26:46,558
she would calculate the proportion of

719
00:26:44,079 --> 00:26:49,079
reads that was of each of her species of

720
00:26:46,558 --> 00:26:51,558
interest and in order for this method to

721
00:26:49,079 --> 00:26:53,319
work what we really needed to see was we

722
00:26:51,558 --> 00:26:55,798
would get sort of like a predictable

723
00:26:53,319 --> 00:26:56,960
response of a species proportion in the

724
00:26:55,798 --> 00:26:59,519
reads that we would get from our

725
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:01,399
sequencing data and then the um the

726
00:26:59,519 --> 00:27:03,240
actual species proportion and the sample

727
00:27:01,398 --> 00:27:06,599
mass of all of these little mock

728
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:09,960
mixtures that we created so how well did

729
00:27:06,599 --> 00:27:12,199
her does her method work so um so what

730
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:15,558
we're looking at now is the relationship

731
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:18,278
between um or so this is the on the x-

732
00:27:15,558 --> 00:27:20,960
axis here it's the proportion of each of

733
00:27:18,278 --> 00:27:22,759
these species that was in in mass that

734
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:26,240
was in all of her little mock mixtures

735
00:27:22,759 --> 00:27:28,720
that she created and then the Y AIS here

736
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:30,558
is what we would have predicted

737
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:31,880
based on our models okay so really what

738
00:27:30,558 --> 00:27:33,720
we're looking at is like The observed

739
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:35,240
versus the predicted so like how well

740
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:38,319
are the models that we generated based

741
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:42,200
on this data doing and predicting um and

742
00:27:38,319 --> 00:27:44,759
so you know it's not perfect but it has

743
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:46,919
you know a somewhat um uh you know a

744
00:27:44,759 --> 00:27:48,839
pretty good upward Trend I would have

745
00:27:46,919 --> 00:27:50,759
liked an R square that was a little bit

746
00:27:48,839 --> 00:27:53,278
higher but roots are messy fieldwork is

747
00:27:50,759 --> 00:27:55,200
messy so you know an R square between 7

748
00:27:53,278 --> 00:27:56,200
and 08 it could have been could have

749
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,679
been better but it could have been a lot

750
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:59,319
worse so you know we're happy you know I

751
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:00,600
think it for the most part works well

752
00:27:59,319 --> 00:28:02,599
and we're sort of interested in thinking

753
00:28:00,599 --> 00:28:03,959
about are ways that we can use to get

754
00:28:02,599 --> 00:28:07,398
better predictions from this method in

755
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:10,720
the future um and so then using this

756
00:28:07,398 --> 00:28:13,759
method to predict how each of these how

757
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:15,319
much um uh um growth these species

758
00:28:13,759 --> 00:28:17,720
allocated to their roots and their

759
00:28:15,319 --> 00:28:19,200
monocultures versus mixtures so um

760
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:23,079
here's what we're looking at um here so

761
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:25,919
we have our four different species on um

762
00:28:23,079 --> 00:28:27,759
at at the bottom and then the blue bars

763
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:29,840
are the root mass fraction so the

764
00:28:27,759 --> 00:28:32,720
proportion portion of plant biomass that

765
00:28:29,839 --> 00:28:35,798
was allocated to the roots um is the Y

766
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:38,919
AIS um and so you know as you can see

767
00:28:35,798 --> 00:28:41,278
there were some species that we had sort

768
00:28:38,919 --> 00:28:43,159
of consistent Trends so for example

769
00:28:41,278 --> 00:28:45,119
Clover we really only had one year was

770
00:28:43,159 --> 00:28:47,559
statistically significant but we saw

771
00:28:45,119 --> 00:28:50,079
sort of like a greater you know a trend

772
00:28:47,558 --> 00:28:51,678
for um all three years having greater um

773
00:28:50,079 --> 00:28:54,319
root allocation in the mixture compared

774
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:55,798
to monoculture tril similar only one

775
00:28:54,319 --> 00:28:58,398
year was statistically significant but

776
00:28:55,798 --> 00:28:59,839
there was a trend um for greater root

777
00:28:58,398 --> 00:29:01,558
mass fraction in the monoculture

778
00:28:59,839 --> 00:29:02,879
compared the mixture but for p and

779
00:29:01,558 --> 00:29:06,000
canola we really saw sort of like

780
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:08,360
differing you know patterns over time um

781
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,679
so um for example especially canola you

782
00:29:08,359 --> 00:29:12,558
know one year greater in the monoculture

783
00:29:10,679 --> 00:29:14,120
another year greater in the fixure so

784
00:29:12,558 --> 00:29:17,759
you know this really suggests that

785
00:29:14,119 --> 00:29:20,639
plants are varying their allocation

786
00:29:17,759 --> 00:29:22,599
patterns based on sort of like the

787
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:24,320
community Dynamics and what other plants

788
00:29:22,599 --> 00:29:25,918
are around them and how that might be

789
00:29:24,319 --> 00:29:28,200
affecting their own growth or

790
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:29,799
potentially abiotic factors and so you

791
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:32,600
know trying to develop methods where we

792
00:29:29,798 --> 00:29:35,200
can really try to estimate um uh you

793
00:29:32,599 --> 00:29:37,879
know how much root biomas individual

794
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:40,120
species um could be you know super

795
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:42,679
useful in the future because we can't

796
00:29:40,119 --> 00:29:44,959
necessarily always predict a plant's

797
00:29:42,679 --> 00:29:48,200
below ground biomass solely based on its

798
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:51,079
abovegr biomass um and so some of the

799
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:52,200
areas where I um excited to move this

800
00:29:51,079 --> 00:29:54,519
method to in the future is whether or

801
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:56,840
not we can sort of predict our ability

802
00:29:54,519 --> 00:29:58,720
to estimate root biomass and then also

803
00:29:56,839 --> 00:30:00,599
what I'd really like to do is to be able

804
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:02,200
to adapt this method to work in more

805
00:30:00,599 --> 00:30:04,278
diverse communities you know potentially

806
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:07,038
crops that are competing with weeds the

807
00:30:04,278 --> 00:30:08,640
reason why we use cover crops is because

808
00:30:07,038 --> 00:30:10,158
they're all like basically crops right

809
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:12,360
and so they had their whole genomes

810
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:13,760
available to us so it was a lot easier

811
00:30:12,359 --> 00:30:15,240
when we were sort of like trying to

812
00:30:13,759 --> 00:30:17,278
develop our Universal primaries and

813
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:19,679
things like that to have the Genome of a

814
00:30:17,278 --> 00:30:21,519
of a plant um available um but there's a

815
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:22,919
lot more genomes of weed species coming

816
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:24,880
coming out so you know it would be great

817
00:30:22,919 --> 00:30:27,440
to be able to adapt this method um to

818
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:29,120
have more diverse um diverse species in

819
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:30,759
the future

820
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:32,599
um so I just want to sort of end sort of

821
00:30:30,759 --> 00:30:34,158
like here's some areas that my lab is

822
00:30:32,599 --> 00:30:36,199
working on I'm really excited of some of

823
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:38,480
the work that we're coming out um if

824
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:41,200
you're interested in any of this I keep

825
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:42,640
my Google Scholar most up to date so you

826
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,759
could just sort of Google Scholar search

827
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:45,919
me I'm trying to get better about

828
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:48,879
updating my lab website but you know

829
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:50,799
it's hard um yeah and I want to end by

830
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:52,278
acknowledging all my collaborators you

831
00:30:50,798 --> 00:30:54,798
know really a lot of this work could not

832
00:30:52,278 --> 00:30:56,200
have been done um without sort of you

833
00:30:54,798 --> 00:30:58,440
know the collaborators who helped me

834
00:30:56,200 --> 00:31:00,480
sort of build up this expertise lab did

835
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:03,840
all of this work without owning a single

836
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:06,278
pipet and so I really like it was very

837
00:31:03,839 --> 00:31:08,240
much the you know the collaborators that

838
00:31:06,278 --> 00:31:09,638
have really sort of supported this um

839
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:11,599
and then my funding sources at the

840
00:31:09,638 --> 00:31:13,240
bottom and then with that I will take

841
00:31:11,599 --> 00:31:15,359
any

842
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:16,839
questions I appreciate your talk I have

843
00:31:15,359 --> 00:31:19,918
a question that kind of spans all of

844
00:31:16,839 --> 00:31:22,519
your experiments okay how did you manage

845
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:24,320
needs kind of contaminating h of

846
00:31:22,519 --> 00:31:26,839
situation for you yeah so I would say

847
00:31:24,319 --> 00:31:28,319
like the first situation the prenal

848
00:31:26,839 --> 00:31:30,038
forage I mean like it it definitely

849
00:31:28,319 --> 00:31:33,200
became more wey over time you know I

850
00:31:30,038 --> 00:31:36,879
would say initially we had our stands of

851
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:39,200
um of you know our the for shg did not

852
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:40,880
do that well so that got pretty weedy

853
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:42,759
but everything else should have did okay

854
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:44,960
but you know weeds came in over time and

855
00:31:42,759 --> 00:31:46,720
the best that we can do is we we um

856
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:48,960
measured we' biomass and we might be

857
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:49,919
able to use that as a co-variate but at

858
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:52,000
the same point in time like you said

859
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:53,799
there were no treatment differences no

860
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,200
real effect of the plan community so

861
00:31:53,798 --> 00:31:58,079
yeah I don't know how much getting at

862
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:59,200
like maybe you had some yeah maybe weeds

863
00:31:58,079 --> 00:32:01,918
possibly yeah it's definitely something

864
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:04,960
we could look into in the future um yeah

865
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:06,000
so then the the sort of climate change

866
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:07,360
we just sort of like handpulled

867
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,159
everything all of our plots are pretty

868
00:32:07,359 --> 00:32:12,638
small so we just hand pulled everything

869
00:32:09,159 --> 00:32:16,000
and then oh yeah okay so the the root

870
00:32:12,638 --> 00:32:18,439
study okay so Emma two to three times a

871
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:20,038
year would go out to her sampling points

872
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:22,320
and we and hand readed everything

873
00:32:20,038 --> 00:32:25,319
because she really was trying to limit

874
00:32:22,319 --> 00:32:27,119
the amount of other species um that

875
00:32:25,319 --> 00:32:30,079
could get in but even with that you know

876
00:32:27,119 --> 00:32:31,798
there was a Legacy of root biomass root

877
00:32:30,079 --> 00:32:34,398
tissue in the soil that you know

878
00:32:31,798 --> 00:32:36,638
probably gave us some contamination um

879
00:32:34,398 --> 00:32:40,359
but she did look at sort of like you

880
00:32:36,638 --> 00:32:42,319
know she was able to characterize um for

881
00:32:40,359 --> 00:32:44,798
the most common weed species and sort of

882
00:32:42,319 --> 00:32:46,200
identify which um you know of her weeds

883
00:32:44,798 --> 00:32:47,398
went to all of those and then so

884
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:49,679
basically what she was able to do is

885
00:32:47,398 --> 00:32:51,079
like you know plot out whether or not

886
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:53,480
the proportion of her weeds that were

887
00:32:51,079 --> 00:32:55,000
weeds affected the sort of like

888
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:56,558
difference between predicted and

889
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:59,079
observed from her model and there was no

890
00:32:56,558 --> 00:33:01,319
relationship so it probably created

891
00:32:59,079 --> 00:33:03,839
variability I it definitely wasn't like

892
00:33:01,319 --> 00:33:04,759
variability that we could predict um but

893
00:33:03,839 --> 00:33:06,879
that was really like the best we could

894
00:33:04,759 --> 00:33:09,200
do at this time I mean it would be so

895
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:12,720
that long-term experiment is also like

896
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:15,360
insanely Bey so you know maybe if we try

897
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:18,159
to do that a similar study at um in a

898
00:33:15,359 --> 00:33:19,879
field that like wasn't organic and you

899
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:21,600
know had didn't have that weed density

900
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:24,679
maybe we'd have some better results so

901
00:33:21,599 --> 00:33:26,678
we're actually doing that now we've sort

902
00:33:24,679 --> 00:33:29,360
of like moved to a field that is less

903
00:33:26,679 --> 00:33:32,840
wey so we'll see what happens

904
00:33:29,359 --> 00:33:34,879
yes yeah great talk a lot of very hard

905
00:33:32,839 --> 00:33:36,959
things to do in the field yeah I

906
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:38,440
appreciate that a lot yeah I mean like

907
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:40,759
you don't even those open top Chambers

908
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:43,639
man like we've had those like blow

909
00:33:40,759 --> 00:33:45,759
across the highway and like yeah anyway

910
00:33:43,638 --> 00:33:49,079
yeah so thank you for for noticing that

911
00:33:45,759 --> 00:33:51,759
oh yeah it's it's tough um out there so

912
00:33:49,079 --> 00:33:54,240
I I was curious about your microbe work

913
00:33:51,759 --> 00:33:55,919
cover cropping and I I think like you

914
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:57,480
know the thought is like oh okay we have

915
00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:59,679
these cover crops and like they might

916
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:01,038
help lots of different benefits and

917
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:03,038
really are interested in knowing like

918
00:34:01,038 --> 00:34:04,200
what all these different benefits are

919
00:34:03,038 --> 00:34:06,679
yeah they like I'm going to bury my

920
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:09,240
seeds in these plots and then you didn't

921
00:34:06,679 --> 00:34:12,000
really find any consistent Trends yeah

922
00:34:09,239 --> 00:34:15,598
um I was at a farm once and the farmer

923
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:17,480
was like growing buckweed right cover

924
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:20,320
crop yeah and it was just shattering all

925
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:21,559
over the place like I asked him about it

926
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:25,119
and he was like ah you know I'd rather

927
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:27,599
weed buckweed seeds than than have to

928
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:29,440
deal with the regular seed bank yeah

929
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:32,800
yeah yeah so I'm curious what your

930
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:35,039
thoughts are on like should we have a

931
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:37,679
certain amount of weed seeds in order to

932
00:34:35,039 --> 00:34:40,320
promote the microbes that then help to

933
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:42,519
suppress the bad weed seeds and is the

934
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:44,960
approach because the goal with the cover

935
00:34:42,519 --> 00:34:46,358
crops is to suppress weed seeds right

936
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:47,878
yeah so if you're suppressing all the

937
00:34:46,358 --> 00:34:51,358
weed seeds and you've eliminated the

938
00:34:47,878 --> 00:34:54,838
host for the microb yeah eat on them

939
00:34:51,358 --> 00:34:56,519
curious like if you could do it again or

940
00:34:54,838 --> 00:34:58,679
if you have some other thoughts about

941
00:34:56,519 --> 00:35:00,679
future directions for that work yeah so

942
00:34:58,679 --> 00:35:03,838
I've thought about doing that of like

943
00:35:00,679 --> 00:35:05,159
can we sort of like select for you know

944
00:35:03,838 --> 00:35:06,880
can we sort of like have some

945
00:35:05,159 --> 00:35:08,838
incubations where we have soil and we

946
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:10,760
crush up a bunch of wheat seeds and we

947
00:35:08,838 --> 00:35:12,559
put them in and then we like take that

948
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:13,800
sort of community and we do it again and

949
00:35:12,559 --> 00:35:15,358
we and sort of like have lots of

950
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:18,280
different Generations over time and can

951
00:35:15,358 --> 00:35:19,799
we evolve microbes um that are more

952
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:23,560
effective at infecting and killing weed

953
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:26,599
seeds um I am like just dipping my toe

954
00:35:23,559 --> 00:35:28,078
into this microbial world and so um it's

955
00:35:26,599 --> 00:35:30,079
definitely like something that thinking

956
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:31,720
about and really interested in I feel

957
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:33,519
like I would need to buy a pip pet

958
00:35:31,719 --> 00:35:35,959
before we went that route you know what

959
00:35:33,519 --> 00:35:38,239
I mean like I feel like we would need to

960
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:40,320
sort of drastically increase our

961
00:35:38,239 --> 00:35:41,439
capacity to work with microbes um but I

962
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:42,760
would definitely be interested like you

963
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:44,800
know working with a collaborator who

964
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:46,200
actually had you know the capacity to

965
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:47,599
sort of do that type of work like you

966
00:35:46,199 --> 00:35:49,159
know be that sterile and that you would

967
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:50,280
need to do in order to do something like

968
00:35:49,159 --> 00:35:51,118
that you know I would definitely be

969
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:53,680
interested in collaborating with

970
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:55,160
something like that but at this point um

971
00:35:53,679 --> 00:35:57,199
I would say that's sort of like outside

972
00:35:55,159 --> 00:35:59,399
the range of like what we're capable of

973
00:35:57,199 --> 00:36:01,799
doing

974
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:03,440
yes um yeah great talk um I was

975
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:05,960
interested in your first area of

976
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:08,119
research and maybe I missed it but are

977
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:10,720
is seed Decay mainly by bacterial

978
00:36:08,119 --> 00:36:13,119
microbes or fungal microbes

979
00:36:10,719 --> 00:36:14,639
also yes microme sequencing or what

980
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:18,400
you're going to do next yeah so we did

981
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:19,838
do its we're sort of like um we are like

982
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:21,119
sort of dealing with that data right now

983
00:36:19,838 --> 00:36:23,318
we just haven't we haven't sort of like

984
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:25,079
figured out that story yet we really

985
00:36:23,318 --> 00:36:26,719
like just got our sequencing data back

986
00:36:25,079 --> 00:36:28,720
like two months ago so we've sort of

987
00:36:26,719 --> 00:36:30,118
like got night sort of got the bacterial

988
00:36:28,719 --> 00:36:31,838
down but we're so we're going to look at

989
00:36:30,119 --> 00:36:35,079
that there's a lot of reason to believe

990
00:36:31,838 --> 00:36:37,199
that fungi might be bigger appliers

991
00:36:35,079 --> 00:36:39,240
because seeds have such sort of like

992
00:36:37,199 --> 00:36:40,679
protective seed coats and also I just

993
00:36:39,239 --> 00:36:42,159
want out sort of like at a side know I'm

994
00:36:40,679 --> 00:36:44,519
very excited for your seed biology

995
00:36:42,159 --> 00:36:46,358
position to get filled we really need

996
00:36:44,519 --> 00:36:48,800
like more expertise in the world of

997
00:36:46,358 --> 00:36:51,199
people who sort of like understand these

998
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:52,599
seed defenses and you know maybe you

999
00:36:51,199 --> 00:36:53,919
know maybe that's the strategy that we

1000
00:36:52,599 --> 00:36:56,760
need is sort of like targeting these

1001
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:58,519
seed defenses more than the microbes um

1002
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:59,760
but um so there's a lot of reason to

1003
00:36:58,519 --> 00:37:01,000
believe that maybe fungi would be more

1004
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:03,400
effective at sort of like getting past

1005
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,838
seed codes but yeah I'm just not totally

1006
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:06,200
sure yet and we're kind of like dealing

1007
00:37:04,838 --> 00:37:08,159
with that data right now or working

1008
00:37:06,199 --> 00:37:09,598
through it I guess I should say but

1009
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:11,318
hopefully we'll have you know like an

1010
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:13,800
amazing story in like two

1011
00:37:11,318 --> 00:37:15,318
months so Caroline and I really

1012
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:17,359
appreciate that you are tackling some of

1013
00:37:15,318 --> 00:37:18,880
like the hardest questions because it is

1014
00:37:17,358 --> 00:37:21,598
difficult to work in these kind of

1015
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:23,200
natural environments that include soil

1016
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:26,359
so my question was about like the open

1017
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:28,318
top containers yeah when you started

1018
00:37:26,358 --> 00:37:31,440
evaluating some of that and could you

1019
00:37:28,318 --> 00:37:35,838
have seen any possible emergence like in

1020
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:38,400
the fall like you know rather

1021
00:37:35,838 --> 00:37:40,039
than when those species are naturally

1022
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:42,800
supposed to emerge could you have

1023
00:37:40,039 --> 00:37:46,358
facilitated yeah like a fall emergence

1024
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:48,359
and then uh you know a kill of yeah so

1025
00:37:46,358 --> 00:37:50,159
what we did was you know that first year

1026
00:37:48,358 --> 00:37:52,358
we collected the seeds and we put them

1027
00:37:50,159 --> 00:37:55,078
out after temperatures got pretty cold

1028
00:37:52,358 --> 00:37:57,880
so they did experience winter in the

1029
00:37:55,079 --> 00:37:59,920
otc's um but they didn't experience sort

1030
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:01,920
of like the prummer fall or sort of like

1031
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:04,559
you know seed ripening on the plant or

1032
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:06,639
anything like that um but then the next

1033
00:38:04,559 --> 00:38:08,358
year we sort of kept our plots in the

1034
00:38:06,639 --> 00:38:09,960
same spot and then we resp spiked some

1035
00:38:08,358 --> 00:38:12,799
seeds but we still sort of like had that

1036
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:14,000
population there um and so maybe we saw

1037
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:15,880
some effects but we couldn't really

1038
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:18,719
tease it out apart from like what

1039
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:20,640
happened the previous year and then also

1040
00:38:18,719 --> 00:38:22,039
um what happened sort of like you know

1041
00:38:20,639 --> 00:38:23,598
the the seeds that had been there for a

1042
00:38:22,039 --> 00:38:24,880
year versus the ones that we recently

1043
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:26,920
spiked it's definitely something that

1044
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:28,599
I'm like interested in looking at in the

1045
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:30,838
future and sort of also just thinking

1046
00:38:28,599 --> 00:38:32,480
about like you know can we tease apart

1047
00:38:30,838 --> 00:38:35,519
sort of like emergence from dor like

1048
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:36,800
breaking dorcy and um yeah so those are

1049
00:38:35,519 --> 00:38:38,480
all sort of I like I would love to be

1050
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:40,000
able to like increase temperatures even

1051
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:42,039
more than what we get like by having

1052
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,318
something like soil heating cables um to

1053
00:38:42,039 --> 00:38:44,960
have more in effect but you know I think

1054
00:38:43,318 --> 00:38:46,639
that there could be some interesting

1055
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:48,639
questions about sort of like trying to

1056
00:38:46,639 --> 00:38:50,679
tease apart dormy breaking versus like

1057
00:38:48,639 --> 00:38:53,799
actual germination

1058
00:38:50,679 --> 00:38:56,279
emerence yes I'm wondering the open to

1059
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:57,640
Chambers even increase the temperature

1060
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:59,800
there I believe there are some

1061
00:38:57,639 --> 00:39:02,159
compounding effects for example s

1062
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:03,839
radiation might be decreased or humidity

1063
00:39:02,159 --> 00:39:05,239
be increased Oh you mean like sort of

1064
00:39:03,838 --> 00:39:07,279
like there might have been like other

1065
00:39:05,239 --> 00:39:09,519
environmental variation consider that

1066
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:11,760
issue too yeah so in the first year we

1067
00:39:09,519 --> 00:39:14,318
were kind of on like a a Sho string

1068
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:16,200
budget um and so we did not measure soil

1069
00:39:14,318 --> 00:39:18,440
moisture because I like you know I just

1070
00:39:16,199 --> 00:39:20,559
soil moisture sensors are so expensive

1071
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:22,200
but then we got a ni Grant so then we

1072
00:39:20,559 --> 00:39:24,920
bought the soil sensors for the second

1073
00:39:22,199 --> 00:39:27,159
year we did see quite a lot of variation

1074
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:28,400
in how they affected soil moisture um I

1075
00:39:27,159 --> 00:39:29,279
don't know like you know I think we

1076
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,920
still need to actually like

1077
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:32,720
statistically test it but it seems like

1078
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:36,159
we I would have expected the open top

1079
00:39:32,719 --> 00:39:37,439
Chambers to have been drier but our data

1080
00:39:36,159 --> 00:39:38,639
is showing that wasn't the case and

1081
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:40,559
there were actually like points where

1082
00:39:38,639 --> 00:39:42,279
they were there was maybe a little bit

1083
00:39:40,559 --> 00:39:44,119
higher moisture and so we were wondering

1084
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:46,960
like could rainfall have been like

1085
00:39:44,119 --> 00:39:49,400
running down the sides and I don't yeah

1086
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:51,159
I'm not sure but um so we are sort of

1087
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:52,960
measuring soil moisture and you know we

1088
00:39:51,159 --> 00:39:55,879
want to take that into

1089
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:57,838
account the commity might also affect

1090
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:59,480
the possibly

1091
00:39:57,838 --> 00:40:02,119
yeah I mean the seeds are like in the

1092
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:04,480
soil and they like IDE water from the

1093
00:40:02,119 --> 00:40:06,280
soil so it's possible that humidity

1094
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:07,838
could be plain Factor but I think that

1095
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:10,200
probably soil moisture would be more

1096
00:40:07,838 --> 00:40:12,719
more important and often what people use

1097
00:40:10,199 --> 00:40:14,399
to model emergence is like you know the

1098
00:40:12,719 --> 00:40:16,318
often used hydrothermal time so they'll

1099
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:18,880
sort of like be integrating soil water

1100
00:40:16,318 --> 00:40:20,519
potential into that I have another

1101
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:24,119
question from your your first study

1102
00:40:20,519 --> 00:40:26,239
within microbial um you you showed pal

1103
00:40:24,119 --> 00:40:29,559
amaranth and pal amaranth is really

1104
00:40:26,239 --> 00:40:32,919
really really small seed yeah I know um

1105
00:40:29,559 --> 00:40:36,239
and um did you do any other species you

1106
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:37,838
know like the Velvet leaves like the

1107
00:40:36,239 --> 00:40:40,159
yeah the fox tails that are going to be

1108
00:40:37,838 --> 00:40:42,440
larger seeded and like you know the

1109
00:40:40,159 --> 00:40:44,000
Velvet Leaf also has a hard seed coat

1110
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:45,960
yeah so we actually did have a second

1111
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,960
species we had Velvet Leaf but the thing

1112
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:50,280
that was we actually did not submit the

1113
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:52,960
Velvet Leaf seeds for sequencing and the

1114
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:55,079
reason why was because Velvet Leaf was

1115
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:57,599
either gone like we couldn't recover

1116
00:40:55,079 --> 00:40:59,800
them or they were alive so we didn't

1117
00:40:57,599 --> 00:41:01,599
have this sort of like some seeds were

1118
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:04,079
dead but we could still extract DNA from

1119
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:06,800
them and some seeds were viable it was

1120
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:08,079
just like viable or gone and so you know

1121
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:10,599
I think what happens with a Velvet Leaf

1122
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:12,480
is the moment that seed coat cracks that

1123
00:41:10,599 --> 00:41:14,559
hard seed coat cracks it's just like a

1124
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:16,358
free-for-all like you know that's all

1125
00:41:14,559 --> 00:41:17,679
that's it invests all of its defenses

1126
00:41:16,358 --> 00:41:21,639
into that hard SE coat and when that

1127
00:41:17,679 --> 00:41:23,318
cracks it's basically gone um and so so

1128
00:41:21,639 --> 00:41:25,199
yeah I want to try more with like some

1129
00:41:23,318 --> 00:41:26,960
other species so the pigweed really

1130
00:41:25,199 --> 00:41:29,199
limited us because what I wanted to do

1131
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:30,800
for that final time point was with

1132
00:41:29,199 --> 00:41:32,639
viability testing you cut the seeds in

1133
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:34,640
half and so I wanted for each individual

1134
00:41:32,639 --> 00:41:36,679
seed to submit half of the seed for

1135
00:41:34,639 --> 00:41:38,639
viability testing and then half would

1136
00:41:36,679 --> 00:41:40,519
get Frozen and then we could pull all of

1137
00:41:38,639 --> 00:41:42,078
the viable seeds and like because all

1138
00:41:40,519 --> 00:41:44,358
the data I presented was like this

1139
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:46,519
sample had this percent mortality and

1140
00:41:44,358 --> 00:41:48,598
this sample had this microbial Community

1141
00:41:46,519 --> 00:41:50,039
but I couldn't say this seed was dead

1142
00:41:48,599 --> 00:41:51,400
and this was the microbial you know and

1143
00:41:50,039 --> 00:41:53,559
so it would have been nice to be able to

1144
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:56,760
do that and Cara eer my master student

1145
00:41:53,559 --> 00:42:00,358
who did all that work phenomenal um she

1146
00:41:56,760 --> 00:42:02,040
tried and like if if if there's anything

1147
00:42:00,358 --> 00:42:04,119
in the world that can be done Cara could

1148
00:42:02,039 --> 00:42:05,838
do it and she was getting so

1149
00:42:04,119 --> 00:42:07,318
unbelievably frustrated trying to do

1150
00:42:05,838 --> 00:42:09,078
that like you know trying to preserve

1151
00:42:07,318 --> 00:42:11,119
the seeds enough so that she could do

1152
00:42:09,079 --> 00:42:12,880
use half of the seed for both purposes

1153
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:15,280
and it just was not working and so so I

1154
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:18,358
would like to do it with larger seeds

1155
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:20,960
that we could then actually have like a

1156
00:42:18,358 --> 00:42:22,960
you know like like really do more

1157
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:24,679
indepth seed work by having half the

1158
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:25,960
seeds go to viability testing half the

1159
00:42:24,679 --> 00:42:29,118
seeds go to

1160
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:30,119
sequencing yeah so I have question but I

1161
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:32,318
was wondering if there's might be

1162
00:42:30,119 --> 00:42:34,480
anybody on yes thank you thank you there

1163
00:42:32,318 --> 00:42:37,880
is nothing nothing

1164
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:41,079
online so um I'm just wondering the the

1165
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:43,800
first experiment you highlighted a few

1166
00:42:41,079 --> 00:42:45,880
um bacterial species yes were different

1167
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:47,559
among the different populations and I'm

1168
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:50,920
just wondering if you looked them up but

1169
00:42:47,559 --> 00:42:53,240
they were to me yes there any sort of um

1170
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:54,240
known function that maybe could be

1171
00:42:53,239 --> 00:42:57,239
related

1172
00:42:54,239 --> 00:43:01,719
TOS can I go there yeah okay I'm there

1173
00:42:57,239 --> 00:43:03,919
okay okay yeah so this this kenoia um

1174
00:43:01,719 --> 00:43:05,519
all three of these there wasn't a lot of

1175
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:07,200
information that I could find on them so

1176
00:43:05,519 --> 00:43:09,599
this one is you know as the name applies

1177
00:43:07,199 --> 00:43:12,399
sort of um it can break down kitan so

1178
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:16,760
actually it's like a bacteria that like

1179
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:19,039
breaks down kiten in viral like in

1180
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:21,200
viruses or something like that like I

1181
00:43:19,039 --> 00:43:22,960
know was super weird and I was like oh

1182
00:43:21,199 --> 00:43:26,000
like you know kitan is a really sort of

1183
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:27,519
like recalcitrant compound and I think

1184
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,519
that would make sense that some that was

1185
00:43:27,519 --> 00:43:30,880
good at breaking down these calcitrin

1186
00:43:29,519 --> 00:43:32,759
compounds would be good at infecting

1187
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:34,480
seeds so I could see but it was like

1188
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:36,880
very viral focused I was a little bit

1189
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:40,240
confused um and then I can't remember

1190
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:43,318
which one of these had some pathogenetic

1191
00:43:40,239 --> 00:43:44,558
function sort of characterized by uh by

1192
00:43:43,318 --> 00:43:46,358
it I can't remember if it was the kbella

1193
00:43:44,559 --> 00:43:47,640
or the lysobacter but the other one I

1194
00:43:46,358 --> 00:43:51,000
like really could not find that much

1195
00:43:47,639 --> 00:43:54,279
information about so um yeah and you

1196
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:56,199
know um uh sort of like getting into

1197
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:58,960
these micro functions and what they do

1198
00:43:56,199 --> 00:44:00,439
sort of like a whole new area for me um

1199
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:02,679
but yeah so you know it' be interesting

1200
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:04,559
to sort of like do future work and see

1201
00:44:02,679 --> 00:44:06,519
like do we still get like if I was to

1202
00:44:04,559 --> 00:44:07,800
bury seeds in a completely different

1203
00:44:06,519 --> 00:44:10,719
field let's just say a field that was

1204
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:13,079
like two hours away would I still see

1205
00:44:10,719 --> 00:44:14,439
these same gener in the seeds and I

1206
00:44:13,079 --> 00:44:16,200
think that would be super interesting to

1207
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:18,079
know and then that would really sort of

1208
00:44:16,199 --> 00:44:19,879
like support sort of like investigating

1209
00:44:18,079 --> 00:44:20,960
whether or not these actually could be

1210
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:23,119
involved in

1211
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:24,519
mortality so definitely a lot more work

1212
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:26,440
to be done but you know this sort of

1213
00:44:24,519 --> 00:44:28,039
like sets up some potential future

1214
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:30,400
hypotheses we could test and I would

1215
00:44:28,039 --> 00:44:32,719
like to see you know are these players

1216
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:34,119
that you know are these bacteria ones

1217
00:44:32,719 --> 00:44:36,279
that we will frequently find in these

1218
00:44:34,119 --> 00:44:37,519
seeds and how much is it very by species

1219
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:39,359
um you know and that could really sort

1220
00:44:37,519 --> 00:44:42,679
of set up support for actually testing

1221
00:44:39,358 --> 00:44:42,679
whether or not there's some mechanistic

1222
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:47,559
way

1223
00:44:44,358 --> 00:44:50,358
yes look at what the like naturally

1224
00:44:47,559 --> 00:44:53,280
occurring sorry microbial composition is

1225
00:44:50,358 --> 00:44:57,679
in just the like bulk soil or other so

1226
00:44:53,280 --> 00:45:02,400
we so you know um we did the sequencing

1227
00:44:57,679 --> 00:45:05,239
of the soil that was in proximity to the

1228
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:06,639
seed bags but what we didn't do and

1229
00:45:05,239 --> 00:45:07,959
again it was just sort of like I didn't

1230
00:45:06,639 --> 00:45:10,598
have a lot of funding for this and sort

1231
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:13,599
of like funding came later we didn't do

1232
00:45:10,599 --> 00:45:16,599
like the starting microbial community in

1233
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:18,318
the soil um like before like when we

1234
00:45:16,599 --> 00:45:19,880
bury the seeds and that is like you know

1235
00:45:18,318 --> 00:45:21,519
when you have these like regrets I don't

1236
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:24,000
know that's like a regret like I really

1237
00:45:21,519 --> 00:45:26,318
have you know um like I wish we had done

1238
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:28,239
that because I'm wondering maybe what

1239
00:45:26,318 --> 00:45:30,639
matters most most is the microbial

1240
00:45:28,239 --> 00:45:32,959
Community like the moment seeds hit the

1241
00:45:30,639 --> 00:45:35,519
oil like maybe that maybe those priority

1242
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:37,480
effects are what govern govern this um

1243
00:45:35,519 --> 00:45:39,119
and so we did so we had like the two and

1244
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:40,960
the two and a half year time point we

1245
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:43,039
were able to sequence the micro whe

1246
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:45,039
Community we found an effect of

1247
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:46,800
treatment so we found a statistically

1248
00:45:45,039 --> 00:45:49,880
significant different in our difference

1249
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:50,960
in our um treat our uh uh the soil

1250
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:53,480
collected from our penal forage

1251
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:54,599
treatments um with a permanova but then

1252
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:55,960
when I tried to do like you know

1253
00:45:54,599 --> 00:45:57,760
principal coordinate analysis to see if

1254
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:58,960
I could visualize that they all looked

1255
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:00,800
very similar so it's something that we

1256
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:02,559
need to sort of like explore further

1257
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:04,960
maybe with different sort of statistical

1258
00:46:02,559 --> 00:46:06,680
techniques to be able to figure out what

1259
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:07,960
sort of um variation in the community

1260
00:46:06,679 --> 00:46:08,598
actually explains that difference so

1261
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:10,358
it's something that we're going to

1262
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:13,599
explore further but you know I really

1263
00:46:10,358 --> 00:46:15,519
like I could go back in time I wish I

1264
00:46:13,599 --> 00:46:18,640
had that soil but I don't

1265
00:46:15,519 --> 00:46:20,639
yeah oh yeah yeah I just have a quick

1266
00:46:18,639 --> 00:46:22,639
question with the principal coordinate

1267
00:46:20,639 --> 00:46:24,719
analysis I was just wondering what's the

1268
00:46:22,639 --> 00:46:27,159
dissimilarity metric with us and if you

1269
00:46:24,719 --> 00:46:29,279
tried any other one so we only tried by

1270
00:46:27,159 --> 00:46:30,358
Curtis since we haven't tried any others

1271
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:31,559
but yeah something that we'll probably

1272
00:46:30,358 --> 00:46:32,719
be playing around with in the future it

1273
00:46:31,559 --> 00:46:34,640
just sort of seemed that like that's

1274
00:46:32,719 --> 00:46:36,000
what all the micro people use and so I

1275
00:46:34,639 --> 00:46:37,598
was like all right well that's what you

1276
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,838
all do but now you know the more you get

1277
00:46:37,599 --> 00:46:42,318
into it you realize that not all micro

1278
00:46:39,838 --> 00:46:43,119
people agree on things and so yeah so

1279
00:46:42,318 --> 00:46:44,759
it's definitely something we're going to

1280
00:46:43,119 --> 00:46:46,559
play around with a little bit or maybe

1281
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:49,160
use other sort of type of ordination

1282
00:46:46,559 --> 00:46:52,000
techniques like an nmds see if we can

1283
00:46:49,159 --> 00:46:54,759
you know visualize some

1284
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:57,039
differences nothing on chat any other

1285
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:59,599
questions is there any other questions

1286
00:46:57,039 --> 00:47:01,519
know like not sure when you when youall

1287
00:46:59,599 --> 00:47:04,079
are done okay yeah all right thank you

1288
00:47:01,519 --> 00:47:04,079
so much for

1289
00:47:08,599 --> 00:47:14,160
coming this has been a production of

1290
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:17,160
