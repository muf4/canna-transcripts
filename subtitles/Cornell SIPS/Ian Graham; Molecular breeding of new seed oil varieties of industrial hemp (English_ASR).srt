University okay I think the numbers have

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,000
stabilized many of you already know me

University of York where he remains with

26
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:23,879
his research focused on biosynthesis of

27
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:26,400
plant natural products and how these can

28
00:01:23,879 --> 00:01:28,879
be developed for various industrial

of Integrative PL science sip YouTube

50
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:30,400
channel feel free to check the four

51
00:02:28,039 --> 00:02:34,199
previous ones that we have have already

52
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:37,719
uploaded to our Channel and with that

53
00:02:34,199 --> 00:02:39,119
the virtual stage is all your in good

54
00:02:37,719 --> 00:02:40,878
yes thank you I should first of all

55
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,360
apologize for providing you with such a

56
00:02:40,878 --> 00:02:47,199
long bio it's taken about five minutes

57
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:49,640
of our valuable time so it's a great

58
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:51,919
pleasure to have had this invitation

59
00:02:49,639 --> 00:02:53,719
from Lucia and the people at Cornell I

60
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:56,280
think it's a great idea to have it such

61
00:02:53,719 --> 00:02:58,598
a global seminar I would I honestly

62
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:01,080
didn't appreciate it was so so Global

63
00:02:58,598 --> 00:03:02,919
but welcome every and thank you for

64
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:06,200
turning up to listen to me for the next

65
00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:08,280
40 or 50 minutes uh this is a story

66
00:03:06,199 --> 00:03:11,119
which is really close to my heart it's

67
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:13,199
uh I've been working on hemp in the

68
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:18,000
background of my other main projects and

69
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:21,000
medicinal plants uh for for the last 15

70
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,919
years almost and I think as in other

71
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,120
places getting funding to work on hemp

72
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:28,839
has never been all that easy it's maybe

73
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:31,400
getting a little bit easier now uh with

74
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:33,560
a relax in uh regulations around

75
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:36,599
planting and growing and and all of that

76
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:38,959
especially in North America but uh yeah

77
00:03:36,598 --> 00:03:40,878
it's a great opportunity to to tell you

78
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:42,878
about some of the work that we've done

79
00:03:40,878 --> 00:03:46,359
and uh and also maybe give you some

80
00:03:42,878 --> 00:03:48,399
insight into into seed biology uh which

81
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:51,120
is another one of my interests and has

82
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:53,920
been since I started my lab the year

83
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:55,959
that uh Lucia was born as she pointed

84
00:03:53,919 --> 00:04:00,598
out so that kind of makes me feel a bit

85
00:03:55,959 --> 00:04:02,878
old but there you go so uh molecular

86
00:04:00,598 --> 00:04:05,598
breeding of new seed oil varieties of

87
00:04:02,878 --> 00:04:07,438
industrial hemp I think Industrial Hemp

88
00:04:05,598 --> 00:04:10,839
when you talk about it most people think

89
00:04:07,438 --> 00:04:15,438
about fiber but my focus and my

90
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:19,000
interests over the last uh 40 odd years

91
00:04:15,438 --> 00:04:21,478
have been very much on seeds and uh and

92
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:26,040
oil and then progressing into other

93
00:04:21,478 --> 00:04:28,360
exotic medicinal crops uh the the

94
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:30,240
concept which I'm going to introduce and

95
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:33,960
many of you will be familiar with in

96
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:36,840
terms of altering traits in industrial

97
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:39,879
hemp varieties is reverse genetics and

98
00:04:36,839 --> 00:04:42,560
that's really going from Gene to

99
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:44,959
phenotype rather than forward genetics

100
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:47,360
which is going from phenotype to Gene as

101
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:51,239
it were and of course the potential of

102
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:53,280
reverse genetics in orphan crops orphan

103
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:56,759
crops being those that are not all that

104
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:59,279
well studied or being developed by uh

105
00:04:56,759 --> 00:05:03,400
molecular breeding Tools in particular

106
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:05,918
uh the whole you know revolution in DNA

107
00:05:03,399 --> 00:05:09,519
sequencing and and knowledge of the

108
00:05:05,918 --> 00:05:12,279
genome and genome assemblies now as well

109
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:14,439
uh are greatly facil greatly facilitate

110
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:17,719
this concept of reverse genetics because

111
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:20,279
we can get to so-called candidate genes

112
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:22,600
much much easier than we we ever could

113
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:24,519
before and I'll give you some insight

114
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:26,879
into how we went about doing this even

115
00:05:24,519 --> 00:05:31,198
before the sort of that revolution had

116
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:32,959
really taken off so uh so first of all

117
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:36,520
just let's talk a little bit about

118
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:38,799
Industrial Hemp uh it's of course a

119
00:05:36,519 --> 00:05:41,478
multi-purpose crop we we use that

120
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:46,038
terminology Industrial Hemp for low

121
00:05:41,478 --> 00:05:50,038
canabo hemp that's grown mainly for for

122
00:05:46,038 --> 00:05:54,519
fiber and uh and seed and and then from

123
00:05:50,038 --> 00:05:59,279
seed oil applications as you'll see

124
00:05:54,519 --> 00:06:01,159
uh and and as you'll see in my talk uh

125
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:04,079
that whole concept of doing

126
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:06,919
transcriptome analysis has allowed us to

127
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:10,560
identify genes and modify genes involved

128
00:06:06,918 --> 00:06:13,799
in the seed oil composition and uh just

129
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:15,639
to in North America in fact in Canada

130
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:19,520
the industrial hemp is grow is still

131
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:22,319
grown largely for seed rather than fiber

132
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:25,279
and there's huge potential to develop

133
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:27,759
this crop as a as a multi-purpose crop

134
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:30,079
for fiber as well as seed and maybe I'll

135
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:32,960
just say initially

136
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:35,240
uh that you know hemp has been growing a

137
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:39,399
very very long time and in fact in in

138
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:41,639
the UK uh during the reign of Henry VII

139
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:44,839
when uh in the

140
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:48,038
1600s uh every farm and farmer in the

141
00:06:44,839 --> 00:06:50,119
country was legally obliged to grow a

142
00:06:48,038 --> 00:06:52,959
road which I think is about a third of

143
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:56,079
an acre of hemp because it was so much

144
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:58,000
in need for sailing ships for the for

145
00:06:56,079 --> 00:07:00,038
the sales and for the Rope of those

146
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,839
sailing ships so you can see

147
00:07:00,038 --> 00:07:07,079
it's been a very important part of

148
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:09,598
uh of of the of the UK as well and but

149
00:07:07,079 --> 00:07:12,399
it's Fallen right back and my ambition

150
00:07:09,598 --> 00:07:14,519
is to really increase the the acreage of

151
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:17,318
it again from the something like you

152
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:21,478
know 800 hectors that that are grown

153
00:07:17,319 --> 00:07:23,319
mainly for fiber in the UK today so uh

154
00:07:21,478 --> 00:07:26,038
yeah

155
00:07:23,319 --> 00:07:27,439
uh so just a little bit then about the

156
00:07:26,038 --> 00:07:29,079
crop I don't want to dwell in this

157
00:07:27,439 --> 00:07:31,839
because those of you have tuned in your

158
00:07:29,079 --> 00:07:36,079
interest in hemp you'll know all of this

159
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:37,719
but it's an annual herbaceous uh plant I

160
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:41,399
wanted to make the point that you get

161
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:44,039
both monious and dious varieties dious

162
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:47,038
varieties are are are those that where

163
00:07:44,038 --> 00:07:52,639
the the male and female flowers are are

164
00:07:47,038 --> 00:07:55,878
on are on separate plants in fact uh and

165
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:58,720
uh and that introduces challenges itself

166
00:07:55,879 --> 00:08:01,919
to to to breeding programs so it

167
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:05,759
basically behav like you know uh

168
00:08:01,918 --> 00:08:07,519
separate male and female uh individuals

169
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:10,080
for for uh for

170
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:12,680
crossing and

171
00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:15,758
uh and I've mentioned the different the

172
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:19,319
different drug types it originated in

173
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:22,199
Europe north northern India and Persia

174
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:24,598
but it's now cultivated uh you know

175
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:27,759
around the world in warm to temperate

176
00:08:24,598 --> 00:08:29,959
regions and and and there are good

177
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:33,879
claims around it being used for low

178
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:36,360
input farming and uh and in fact in the

179
00:08:33,879 --> 00:08:40,320
UK one of my ambitions is to really get

180
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:42,959
it adopted is as a brick crop to grow on

181
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:45,519
on good orable land where cereals are

182
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:47,278
growing where every 3 or four years you

183
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:49,480
need to have a break and and at the

184
00:08:47,278 --> 00:08:52,240
minute that's large that break crop is

185
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:55,920
often oil seed rape or Canola as as you

186
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:57,879
refer to it in in in North America and

187
00:08:55,919 --> 00:09:01,078
uh but there's all sorts of issues with

188
00:08:57,879 --> 00:09:03,799
that as being really uh terms of in fact

189
00:09:01,078 --> 00:09:06,319
in Europe now the main sprays that are

190
00:09:03,799 --> 00:09:08,240
used in canola are being banned and so

191
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:10,920
they're looking for alternative brick

192
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:13,039
crops and and Industrial Hemp as one

193
00:09:10,919 --> 00:09:16,439
such that could be really be adopted and

194
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:21,480
Farmers like growing it uh and so the

195
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:23,880
applications are in fiber and and canabo

196
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:26,120
and in seed oil the the industrial hemp

197
00:09:23,879 --> 00:09:27,679
varieties that that they need to be

198
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:32,399
below

199
00:09:27,679 --> 00:09:34,399
2% THC in the UK for us to get a license

200
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:37,679
to grow them I think in the U other

201
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:40,639
places it's 3% and now if you just take

202
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:44,519
a look at this seed it's uh got about 30

203
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:46,879
30 to 35% oil 25% protein the amino acid

204
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:48,480
composition is really really good for

205
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:52,278
human health and if you go into Health

206
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:56,000
Food Shops you can often buy uh you know

207
00:09:52,278 --> 00:09:58,278
hemp hemp seed powder because of the the

208
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,839
uh protein composition and the oil as

209
00:09:58,278 --> 00:10:02,559
will come on to as also very interesting

210
00:10:00,839 --> 00:10:05,160
good for dietary fiber vitamins and

211
00:10:02,559 --> 00:10:07,919
minerals so so nutritionally it's it's

212
00:10:05,159 --> 00:10:12,319
very interesting and is usually in those

213
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:16,159
high-end uh nutritious Foods

214
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:18,079
uh so just this uh when we start this

215
00:10:16,159 --> 00:10:20,919
project and in fact still in North

216
00:10:18,078 --> 00:10:23,319
America this variety phola is one of the

217
00:10:20,919 --> 00:10:25,838
favorites that's grown in Canada in

218
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:29,160
particular uh there are there are other

219
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:33,000
options as well of course but it's it's

220
00:10:29,159 --> 00:10:36,519
uh uh fola itself is interesting it it's

221
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:39,120
a relatively dwarf variety uh which

222
00:10:36,519 --> 00:10:44,120
means that you can combine harvest it

223
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:48,159
for for seed uh early flowering at 25 to

224
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:51,240
30 days early maturing at 115 days and

225
00:10:48,159 --> 00:10:53,719
it's it's a really nice diploid variety

226
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:57,039
that we really like to grow and and work

227
00:10:53,720 --> 00:11:00,600
with here in York as well because it's

228
00:10:57,039 --> 00:11:05,399
fast cycling so so we can you know get

229
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:08,600
uh a couple of uh Generations in in in a

230
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:10,879
year for example in under glass and uh

231
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:13,800
can be grown at high latitudes hence uh

232
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:16,600
it's popular popularity in in Canada

233
00:11:13,799 --> 00:11:18,639
good rotation crop and a see I put in

234
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:20,639
here a seed yield of one to two hectares

235
00:11:18,639 --> 00:11:22,680
there's claims out there that you can

236
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:25,079
get above two hectares and it's very as

237
00:11:22,679 --> 00:11:27,239
like any crop it's not magic and what

238
00:11:25,078 --> 00:11:30,679
you you get out what you put in and it

239
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:33,159
so depends on the soil and the the

240
00:11:30,679 --> 00:11:36,399
the uh the conditions for

241
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:38,919
growth uh I just I'll say something

242
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:41,320
about the actual fatty acid composition

243
00:11:38,919 --> 00:11:44,360
because it's the fatty acid composition

244
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:47,278
in the seed oil uh that that makes it

245
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:50,000
interesting in particular for hemp and

246
00:11:47,278 --> 00:11:51,639
uh so so what you've got what we've got

247
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,240
here is the different types of fatty

248
00:11:51,639 --> 00:11:58,560
acids along the top and then I've

249
00:11:54,240 --> 00:12:02,000
compared hemp uh with or this this table

250
00:11:58,559 --> 00:12:04,159
Compares hemp with other oil crops as it

251
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:07,879
were and you can see immediately that

252
00:12:04,159 --> 00:12:11,799
hemp has got high levels of linolic acid

253
00:12:07,879 --> 00:12:13,519
which is 18 carbons two double bonds

254
00:12:11,799 --> 00:12:16,000
that's what this numbering represents

255
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:17,600
and alpha linolenic acid which is 18

256
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:21,159
carbon three double bonds we'll come on

257
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:24,360
to this in my biochemistry tutorial in a

258
00:12:21,159 --> 00:12:27,480
minute and uh and then the interesting

259
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:30,720
one that I'll be focusing on is OIC acid

260
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:32,440
which is 18 carb one double bond and and

261
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:35,160
so you'll see that the number of double

262
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:38,480
bonds increases as we go across this

263
00:12:35,159 --> 00:12:41,559
table and uh and this puffer is

264
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:44,720
polyunsaturated fatty acids so you can

265
00:12:41,559 --> 00:12:47,719
see that there is a polyunsaturated is

266
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:50,879
anything more than one double bond so

267
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:53,879
you can see that the level of puffers in

268
00:12:50,879 --> 00:12:56,879
in in hemp is high at

269
00:12:53,879 --> 00:12:59,799
84% and uh if you compare that with

270
00:12:56,879 --> 00:13:01,360
olive oil then you can see immediately

271
00:12:59,799 --> 00:13:04,240
that olive oil has got an elevated

272
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:07,800
levels of OIC acid 18 carbons one double

273
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:12,039
bond and uh and then all of these other

274
00:13:07,799 --> 00:13:16,039
uh ones uh nutritionally and and

275
00:13:12,039 --> 00:13:19,120
healthwise both alphal linolenic acid

276
00:13:16,039 --> 00:13:21,360
which is uh which has got three double

277
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:23,959
bonds and gaml linolenic acid we'll come

278
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:26,759
in come onto these in a minute uh you

279
00:13:23,958 --> 00:13:30,278
can see that many of these oil crops

280
00:13:26,759 --> 00:13:32,879
don't have any GLA uh hampus is

281
00:13:30,278 --> 00:13:37,759
relatively uh special let's say rather

282
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:40,000
than than unique and having a 4% GLA and

283
00:13:37,759 --> 00:13:45,278
uh and this ala

284
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:47,639
GLA uh which is omega-3 and Omega 6 oils

285
00:13:45,278 --> 00:13:50,159
again many of you will be aware and may

286
00:13:47,639 --> 00:13:54,480
may indeed take them as as supplements

287
00:13:50,159 --> 00:13:57,838
uh are important for uh are important

288
00:13:54,480 --> 00:14:00,440
for your health and so we were

289
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:01,839
interested in this when we when we were

290
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:04,600
when we thought about changing the

291
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:08,839
composition because obviously if you

292
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:11,519
compare uh the levels of gla galin linic

293
00:14:08,839 --> 00:14:14,759
acid to borage which is very well known

294
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:18,799
to have elevated levels of of gla it

295
00:14:14,759 --> 00:14:22,199
would be nice to have more GLA in in

296
00:14:18,799 --> 00:14:24,838
hemp oil obviously and then but one of

297
00:14:22,198 --> 00:14:29,159
the issues with polyunsaturated fatty

298
00:14:24,839 --> 00:14:32,079
acids is that they get uh they they are

299
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:34,319
oxidized they become oxidized as soon as

300
00:14:32,078 --> 00:14:37,278
you take them out of the seed and in

301
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:40,360
that protective capsule and in fact just

302
00:14:37,278 --> 00:14:42,799
just like fish oil which is which has

303
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:46,079
got elevated levels of polyunsaturated

304
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:48,719
fatty acids in fact 20 carbon and 22

305
00:14:46,078 --> 00:14:51,039
carbon fatty acids in fish oil but that

306
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:54,040
smell of fish oil that you get when the

307
00:14:51,039 --> 00:14:56,599
fish isn't fresh is because the fish oil

308
00:14:54,039 --> 00:14:59,639
is becoming oxidized and exactly the

309
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:01,480
same happens in fact with with temp oil

310
00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:05,360
when you when you take it and leave it

311
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:08,560
open to the air it becomes rancid uh and

312
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:11,839
so so because of that it's not really

313
00:15:08,559 --> 00:15:15,439
all that attractive for for cooking or

314
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:17,360
for processing for processed foods and

315
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:20,759
so obviously then one of the targets

316
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:23,680
could be how could you make uh make this

317
00:15:20,759 --> 00:15:26,519
fatty acid composition more like olive

318
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:28,318
oil and increase the amount of OIC acid

319
00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:31,278
and in so doing you would predict

320
00:15:28,318 --> 00:15:33,879
increase the stability and uh so that

321
00:15:31,278 --> 00:15:36,078
that was sort of the context that that

322
00:15:33,879 --> 00:15:38,879
we came into this project to see if we

323
00:15:36,078 --> 00:15:41,838
could do something about that and that

324
00:15:38,879 --> 00:15:45,120
then I just want to then summarize very

325
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:47,880
quickly the what happens in a developing

326
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:50,679
seed when fatty acids are being made

327
00:15:47,879 --> 00:15:53,639
that accumulate in the seed to give that

328
00:15:50,679 --> 00:15:56,799
that uh vegetable oil that we get from

329
00:15:53,639 --> 00:15:59,318
all plant seeds in fact and also in fact

330
00:15:56,799 --> 00:16:02,240
from olive oil which of course isn't

331
00:15:59,318 --> 00:16:04,759
derived from seeds and so so we've got

332
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:07,240
here this is the plastid which most of

333
00:16:04,759 --> 00:16:09,360
you will be aware of that's present and

334
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:11,600
this is this is involved largely in

335
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:13,120
photosynthesis but it's also involved in

336
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,920
that first stage of fatty acid

337
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:18,440
biosynthesis in seeds and and in fact

338
00:16:15,919 --> 00:16:20,799
fatty acids are synthesized in in

339
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:24,399
developing seeds and in seeds all around

340
00:16:20,799 --> 00:16:27,758
the plant up until they reach that 18

341
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:29,759
carbon one double bond oleic acid that

342
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:31,879
we T that I mentioned

343
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:34,759
uh and this is a fatty acid to saturat

344
00:16:31,879 --> 00:16:37,639
that's soluble and and it's quite unique

345
00:16:34,759 --> 00:16:42,720
and just having this job of converting

346
00:16:37,639 --> 00:16:46,600
160 to 161 pal palic acid and staric

347
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:48,959
acid to 181 and then and then the fatty

348
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:52,240
acids come out into the cytool and there

349
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:54,958
is this whole Suite of of fatty acid

350
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:58,278
desaturases in that keep introducing

351
00:16:54,958 --> 00:17:01,919
more desaturation and double bonds into

352
00:16:58,278 --> 00:17:04,078
that fatty acid backbone and uh and we

353
00:17:01,919 --> 00:17:06,119
know a lot about these from from work

354
00:17:04,078 --> 00:17:08,759
done in other plants so it's a a

355
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:12,318
so-called Delta 12 desaturase which

356
00:17:08,759 --> 00:17:15,119
introduces this fatty acid double bond

357
00:17:12,318 --> 00:17:17,798
uh to get linolic acid and then there's

358
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:20,958
a Delta 15 desaturase that takes it on

359
00:17:17,798 --> 00:17:23,439
to alphal linic alphal linolenic acid

360
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:26,798
and then there's a different desaturase

361
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:29,038
which converts linolic acid to gaml

362
00:17:26,798 --> 00:17:31,160
linolenic acid and and and the

363
00:17:29,038 --> 00:17:34,400
difference between gamma and Alpha as

364
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:37,320
you'll see on the next slide is that

365
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:39,519
they they occur at different positions

366
00:17:37,319 --> 00:17:43,319
on the fatty acid backbone so this is

367
00:17:39,519 --> 00:17:46,319
now this is now a depiction of a fatty

368
00:17:43,319 --> 00:17:48,359
acid this is a leg acid with just one

369
00:17:46,319 --> 00:17:50,240
double bond at the double bond at the

370
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:52,519
nine carbon position this is what comes

371
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:56,000
out of the plastid and then gets acted

372
00:17:52,519 --> 00:17:59,279
on by these membrane bone

373
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:01,759
desaturases that uh then introduce

374
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:05,200
another double bond a Delta at the at

375
00:18:01,759 --> 00:18:08,319
the 12 carbon position and you get 182

376
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:11,880
and then and then you have as I said

377
00:18:08,319 --> 00:18:17,000
this Delta 60 saturase which then gives

378
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:19,720
you uh gamma uh alpha linic acid and

379
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:23,599
then Delta 15 desaturates which gives

380
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:25,600
you alpha linic acid so so you'll see

381
00:18:23,599 --> 00:18:27,839
where we're going with this is that you

382
00:18:25,599 --> 00:18:30,158
need to understand and identify those

383
00:18:27,839 --> 00:18:33,399
desaturases before you can modify them

384
00:18:30,159 --> 00:18:36,120
to uh uh in whatever way you want to and

385
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:39,000
here what we've got is now a developing

386
00:18:36,119 --> 00:18:42,599
seed and these are just the this is the

387
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:45,679
embryo of the developing seed uh and uh

388
00:18:42,599 --> 00:18:48,279
you can see over SE over a couple of

389
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:51,840
months this embryo matures from torpedo

390
00:18:48,279 --> 00:18:56,079
stage to upturn Stage to to this is

391
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:58,480
filled but not desiccated stage fnd and

392
00:18:56,079 --> 00:19:01,599
what we did was we we looked at the

393
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:05,279
trans scripto of the of these developing

394
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:07,319
seeds and we identified using

395
00:19:05,279 --> 00:19:10,960
bioinformatics a whole bunch of

396
00:19:07,319 --> 00:19:14,599
candidate desaturates genes and uh and

397
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:17,079
because there is homology between genes

398
00:19:14,599 --> 00:19:19,038
uh we we then used functionally car

399
00:19:17,079 --> 00:19:22,918
characterized desaturators from other

400
00:19:19,038 --> 00:19:23,879
species and we identified so this this

401
00:19:22,919 --> 00:19:28,960
is

402
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:32,320
a this is the fatty acid disater 2A and

403
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:35,600
2B and basically these are the

404
00:19:32,319 --> 00:19:38,200
deur uh the the the nomenclature here is

405
00:19:35,599 --> 00:19:40,798
confusing uh in the literature as well

406
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:43,120
for people not not

407
00:19:40,798 --> 00:19:45,720
lipidologists uh but this naming came

408
00:19:43,119 --> 00:19:49,279
from mutants and arabidopsis in fact fad

409
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:52,880
2 which was uh which is the Delta 12 de

410
00:19:49,279 --> 00:19:56,119
satures and so this is The Fad 2A and

411
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:58,000
fad 2B and and and this is just a heat

412
00:19:56,119 --> 00:19:59,319
map showing level of expression in the

413
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,240
developing

414
00:19:59,319 --> 00:20:04,158
and so you can see immediately that this

415
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:07,640
fad 2A uh if we're interested in

416
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:09,600
identifying this Delta 12d satures is is

417
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:11,120
is a really strong candidate because

418
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:13,279
it's got this really high level

419
00:20:11,119 --> 00:20:16,359
expression and similarly you can

420
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:19,639
identify you know for these other

421
00:20:16,359 --> 00:20:21,399
desaturases uh candidate genes uh but of

422
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:24,880
course they're only candidates until you

423
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:27,559
really prove the gene function and uh so

424
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:29,400
this is exactly what we did uh and we

425
00:20:27,558 --> 00:20:32,599
were then able to

426
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:35,880
uh to then further explore the function

427
00:20:32,599 --> 00:20:38,759
of these genes and and we we then rather

428
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:40,400
than just rely on on gene expression

429
00:20:38,759 --> 00:20:42,759
data and Counting the number of

430
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:46,360
transcripts that we come across in gene

431
00:20:42,759 --> 00:20:47,839
expression data this slide comes from uh

432
00:20:46,359 --> 00:20:51,759
quantitative

433
00:20:47,839 --> 00:20:56,439
rtpcr and you can see oh sorry uh you

434
00:20:51,759 --> 00:20:59,119
can see that for this Delta 12

435
00:20:56,440 --> 00:21:02,320
desaturase that we we looked at the

436
00:20:59,119 --> 00:21:05,158
expression of two of them and and this

437
00:21:02,319 --> 00:21:07,319
one uh is very impressive in terms of a

438
00:21:05,159 --> 00:21:10,520
potential candidate for developing seeds

439
00:21:07,319 --> 00:21:13,678
because it shows this massive expression

440
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:16,519
at this at this filled not desiccated

441
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:18,519
stage when the oil is fatty acids are

442
00:21:16,519 --> 00:21:20,720
being made and the oil is accumulating

443
00:21:18,519 --> 00:21:23,440
in the seed and then this is the mature

444
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:25,640
seed this is Young Leaf and mature Leaf

445
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:27,759
so so of course when you when you're

446
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:30,480
interested in finding mutations that

447
00:21:27,759 --> 00:21:32,919
will alter SE development or in any kind

448
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:34,720
of way you you want to find genes that

449
00:21:32,919 --> 00:21:36,759
are only expressed in the seeds because

450
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:39,440
you don't want to have an effect

451
00:21:36,759 --> 00:21:42,519
elsewhere in the plant and in fact you

452
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:45,400
could see then this second Gene uh is

453
00:21:42,519 --> 00:21:48,400
very very lowly expressed so this this

454
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:50,360
this Gene immediately became our our

455
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:52,798
Target and then the other thing we did

456
00:21:50,359 --> 00:21:57,879
is we took the

457
00:21:52,798 --> 00:21:59,839
the the cdna the in the protein en

458
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:03,240
coding region of the Gene and

459
00:21:59,839 --> 00:22:08,639
overexpress that in in sacris CIS which

460
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:10,798
is uh brewers yeast and and uh so this

461
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:14,559
this is a really good model for

462
00:22:10,798 --> 00:22:17,119
understanding fatty acid uh functional

463
00:22:14,558 --> 00:22:20,798
gene expression because the the wild

464
00:22:17,119 --> 00:22:24,678
type uh Brewer Yeast only makes

465
00:22:20,798 --> 00:22:27,960
161 and 181 so it makes the fatty acids

466
00:22:24,679 --> 00:22:30,720
which you find in the plastid of a plant

467
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:32,880
but not any of those more sophisticated

468
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:35,038
fatty acids and then when you express

469
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:39,559
that candidate Gene you can see

470
00:22:35,038 --> 00:22:43,400
immediately that the level of 161 Stone

471
00:22:39,558 --> 00:22:46,200
from from this level to this level uh

472
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:50,320
but you get 162 appearing when you

473
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:52,840
express this uh Gene in yeast and then

474
00:22:50,319 --> 00:22:55,079
also the 181 goes down and you get

475
00:22:52,839 --> 00:22:59,119
appearance of 182 so that's really good

476
00:22:55,079 --> 00:23:02,278
evidence that we have indeed got a uh a

477
00:22:59,119 --> 00:23:04,158
hemp Gene including the enzyme which is

478
00:23:02,278 --> 00:23:09,079
responsible for

479
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:12,640
desaturating uh OIC acid and uh and then

480
00:23:09,079 --> 00:23:16,319
we did the same thing with that series

481
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:19,559
of candidate genes for the Delta 15 de

482
00:23:16,319 --> 00:23:21,879
satures and uh and we found a gene which

483
00:23:19,558 --> 00:23:23,918
was predominantly this time some

484
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:26,919
expression in young leaves and mature

485
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:28,559
leaves but predominantly expressed and

486
00:23:26,919 --> 00:23:31,559
increasing expression during C

487
00:23:28,558 --> 00:23:33,839
development and then again what we did

488
00:23:31,558 --> 00:23:36,879
this time because this potential

489
00:23:33,839 --> 00:23:41,199
substrate uh isn't made in yeast we fed

490
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:44,720
this substrate uh lenic acid and uh and

491
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:48,038
we could see that uh when we then add

492
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:50,720
that with this uh Vector expressing the

493
00:23:48,038 --> 00:23:54,519
gene that we actually then get

494
00:23:50,720 --> 00:24:01,400
accumulate we get

495
00:23:54,519 --> 00:24:04,879
accumulation of of the it 183 uh

496
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:07,919
N3 and so

497
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:09,559
uh and so that's then good evidence and

498
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:13,520
and this these different variations of

499
00:24:09,558 --> 00:24:15,720
empty Vector we also added GL and uh and

500
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:19,639
found that we were able to then also

501
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:24,759
desaturate gamma linolenic acid to the

502
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:28,679
stod donic acid so 184 and3 so so that

503
00:24:24,759 --> 00:24:30,720
that then I hope uh takes uh

504
00:24:28,679 --> 00:24:33,000
demonstrates to you that we've indeed

505
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:35,200
got this Gene that is that is producing

506
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:39,480
182 and we've also got this Gene which

507
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:43,000
is producing 183 from linolic acid and

508
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:45,759
184 from gaml linolic acid and so that

509
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:48,359
that then is is great evidence that we

510
00:24:45,759 --> 00:24:50,079
if now if we could knock out those genes

511
00:24:48,359 --> 00:24:52,079
wouldn't it be really cool because then

512
00:24:50,079 --> 00:24:54,599
we could basically introduce a block

513
00:24:52,079 --> 00:24:56,439
here and introduce a block here and then

514
00:24:54,599 --> 00:24:59,918
we could play around with cross signals

515
00:24:56,440 --> 00:25:04,320
as well so uh and that's exactly what we

516
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:07,559
did uh and we we used this method uh

517
00:25:04,319 --> 00:25:10,759
this is before we had Gene editing going

518
00:25:07,558 --> 00:25:14,000
and and also uh this is now really a

519
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:18,000
combination of you know traditional ways

520
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:21,359
to do plant breeding in the 1940s 1950s

521
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:23,679
1960s where you just used you just used

522
00:25:21,359 --> 00:25:25,959
a mutagen and introduced lots and lots

523
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:28,880
of mutations into the genome and then

524
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:31,038
looked for often using forward genetics

525
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:33,399
of course just screen to get a trait of

526
00:25:31,038 --> 00:25:35,839
in a change in a trait of interest but

527
00:25:33,398 --> 00:25:39,000
in this case what we're doing is reverse

528
00:25:35,839 --> 00:25:41,119
genetics where we we use this so-called

529
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:43,519
tilling approach I won't get into the

530
00:25:41,119 --> 00:25:46,038
the nitty-gritty details of it but

531
00:25:43,519 --> 00:25:49,240
essentially what it'll what this is now

532
00:25:46,038 --> 00:25:53,200
using molecular biology where

533
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:56,599
we where we can find

534
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:58,600
heteroduplex uh we can find heteroduplex

535
00:25:56,599 --> 00:25:59,959
formation when we when we mix a

536
00:25:58,599 --> 00:26:03,798
combination of

537
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:07,120
seeds uh from different individuals then

538
00:26:03,798 --> 00:26:10,798
if there's a mutation in a gene in one

539
00:26:07,119 --> 00:26:13,678
individual then when we do when we when

540
00:26:10,798 --> 00:26:17,200
we melt that DNA that's mixed from a

541
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:20,038
number of individuals we can then find a

542
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:24,960
mutation because first of all you will

543
00:26:20,038 --> 00:26:27,119
get pairing of a m a mut a muted Gene

544
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:30,319
sequ a mutated Gene sequence and a wild

545
00:26:27,119 --> 00:26:34,879
type Gene sequence to form a hetr duplex

546
00:26:30,319 --> 00:26:38,119
and then uh we use this enzyme cell one

547
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:39,200
which basically Cuts DNA wherever you

548
00:26:38,119 --> 00:26:41,278
get a

549
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:42,880
heteroduplex and in fact this enzyme

550
00:26:41,278 --> 00:26:45,640
comes from celery which is why it's

551
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:48,480
called cell one and then basically that

552
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:51,559
allows us then to just

553
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:54,519
using using gels using polyacryamide

554
00:26:51,558 --> 00:26:57,558
gels in fact is how we did this and uh

555
00:26:54,519 --> 00:26:59,599
and we found mutations and genes and uh

556
00:26:57,558 --> 00:27:01,759
and the power of this approach as well

557
00:26:59,599 --> 00:27:06,959
is especially when you're working with a

558
00:27:01,759 --> 00:27:09,079
dious uh uh species s uh such as hemp in

559
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:10,399
this case phola it allows you to

560
00:27:09,079 --> 00:27:13,759
identify

561
00:27:10,398 --> 00:27:16,319
mutations in the heterozygous state so

562
00:27:13,759 --> 00:27:18,200
even though recessive mutations you can

563
00:27:16,319 --> 00:27:20,879
identify them in the heterozygous state

564
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:22,399
which is almost a prerequisite for us

565
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:24,799
because it was really really difficult

566
00:27:22,398 --> 00:27:26,918
still is really really difficult to self

567
00:27:24,798 --> 00:27:29,359
M1 M1

568
00:27:26,919 --> 00:27:32,440
plants uh

569
00:27:29,359 --> 00:27:35,678
and so so basically that's what we did

570
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:40,600
we did uh ethyl methan sulfinate

571
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:43,120
mutagenesis which caused G GC to at uh

572
00:27:40,599 --> 00:27:46,599
Transitions and uh we generated a

573
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:48,759
mutagenized population and basically the

574
00:27:46,599 --> 00:27:50,319
way that we crossed that then any

575
00:27:48,759 --> 00:27:53,440
mutations we had were going to be

576
00:27:50,319 --> 00:27:55,359
heterozygous in the M2 seeds and then we

577
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:58,240
did screening essentially the way I'm

578
00:27:55,359 --> 00:28:02,000
not going to dwell on it but uh but it

579
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:05,278
that was once we got the the M the

580
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:09,558
mutagen dose right this proved really

581
00:28:05,278 --> 00:28:13,038
really productive for us and uh in fact

582
00:28:09,558 --> 00:28:17,000
it allowed us to identify heter this

583
00:28:13,038 --> 00:28:19,960
So-Cal heteroduplex mapping uh we got

584
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:22,359
about 60 mutations in two Gene targets

585
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:25,798
because the molecular biology then

586
00:28:22,359 --> 00:28:28,119
allows you to to amplify uh specific

587
00:28:25,798 --> 00:28:30,480
Gene targets and do the heteroduplex mar

588
00:28:28,119 --> 00:28:32,918
mapping on those Gene targets and we

589
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:34,919
followed up 15 of those

590
00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:37,559
mutations uh by

591
00:28:34,919 --> 00:28:39,759
phenotyping and five five of those

592
00:28:37,558 --> 00:28:43,398
showed Mark Chang as a fatty acid

593
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:46,240
profile which is again quite remarkable

594
00:28:43,398 --> 00:28:48,918
and and thus we took those forward into

595
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:50,480
M mutation breeding program in summary

596
00:28:48,919 --> 00:28:53,240
we had three

597
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:56,599
mutations in that Delta

598
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:59,880
12 uh Gene that we that I showed you

599
00:28:56,599 --> 00:29:02,319
that the function of and uh I summarized

600
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:05,000
here what these do you get these really

601
00:29:02,319 --> 00:29:07,918
interesting at sorry these really

602
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:09,759
interesting transitions we had stop

603
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:12,519
codons and when you're looking for

604
00:29:09,759 --> 00:29:15,798
knockout mutations you you really like

605
00:29:12,519 --> 00:29:19,000
stop codons obviously but we also got

606
00:29:15,798 --> 00:29:21,440
other interesting this is a a ProLine to

607
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Lucine transition and Proline which is a

608
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:28,240
really powerful amino acid in terms of

609
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:30,159
of impacting on on protein function

610
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:31,839
because it's responsible for that those

611
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:34,399
Proline kinks are really powerful

612
00:29:31,839 --> 00:29:36,879
mutations as well and uh so we got a

613
00:29:34,398 --> 00:29:39,398
really nice range of of mutations across

614
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:42,440
these two genes and uh and of course

615
00:29:39,398 --> 00:29:45,839
this was described 10 years ago in in

616
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:48,200
this Bika at Al paper which which uh we

617
00:29:45,839 --> 00:29:50,158
published so then we did

618
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:52,200
experimental this is then the work

619
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:54,600
program that we followed where we had

620
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:57,480
Gene Target Discovery and validation

621
00:29:54,599 --> 00:29:58,558
just keeping an eye on the clock here

622
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:02,159
and uh

623
00:29:58,558 --> 00:30:04,678
and then we did lots of uh screening as

624
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:07,880
I've just shown you selected promising

625
00:30:04,679 --> 00:30:10,840
mutations and then we do did breeding

626
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:12,278
and back Crossing and uh I'm not going

627
00:30:10,839 --> 00:30:14,558
to dwell on this because you're all

628
00:30:12,278 --> 00:30:16,319
experts in in breeding in Cornell and

629
00:30:14,558 --> 00:30:19,000
around the world but basically we took

630
00:30:16,319 --> 00:30:21,359
this through and ultimately because of

631
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:23,839
course this is a dious species we we

632
00:30:21,359 --> 00:30:26,599
ultimately end up in Crossing because we

633
00:30:23,839 --> 00:30:28,798
could track the gene in the heterozygous

634
00:30:26,599 --> 00:30:31,158
State because we had nice mole markers

635
00:30:28,798 --> 00:30:32,440
for these mutations as well we then

636
00:30:31,159 --> 00:30:35,880
ultimately took them through to

637
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:40,080
backcross 4 and then crossed homozygous

638
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:45,720
siblings to get homozygous backos 4mh

639
00:30:40,079 --> 00:30:47,558
seed and uh and we we we then uh and one

640
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:49,880
of the nice things we were able to do as

641
00:30:47,558 --> 00:30:53,798
well in terms of phenotyping is we could

642
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:56,559
just NE cut off a one of the cotle Edens

643
00:30:53,798 --> 00:30:59,638
one of the true the first leaves from

644
00:30:56,558 --> 00:31:02,599
the seed and do f acid profiling at the

645
00:30:59,638 --> 00:31:05,558
same time as doing molecular markers and

646
00:31:02,599 --> 00:31:06,759
so so then just to quickly show you then

647
00:31:05,558 --> 00:31:08,638
I wouldn't be telling you all this that

648
00:31:06,759 --> 00:31:10,879
we didn't have really nice phenotypes

649
00:31:08,638 --> 00:31:13,519
when you knock out this Delta 15 de

650
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:16,679
saturas you expect to see an increase in

651
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:18,679
L linolic acid you would expect it to be

652
00:31:16,679 --> 00:31:21,159
a a recessive mutation and that's

653
00:31:18,679 --> 00:31:24,159
exactly what you see the black bars here

654
00:31:21,159 --> 00:31:28,278
are the homozygous mutation you get this

655
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:31,039
elevation in in lenic acid you get this

656
00:31:28,278 --> 00:31:33,359
decrease in 183 and3 in the homozyg

657
00:31:31,038 --> 00:31:35,759
state compared to Wild type and and the

658
00:31:33,359 --> 00:31:38,079
heterozy in fact is intermediary in a

659
00:31:35,759 --> 00:31:43,398
lot of the cases and that was really

660
00:31:38,079 --> 00:31:44,879
nice and uh and yeah I don't I don't

661
00:31:43,398 --> 00:31:46,918
think I need to say anything more about

662
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:50,000
that impressive phenotype and what's

663
00:31:46,919 --> 00:31:53,480
even more impressive is the is when you

664
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:57,558
knock out this Delta 12 de satures uh

665
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:59,960
with a with a uh with either of these

666
00:31:57,558 --> 00:32:02,558
two different mutations which we talked

667
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:05,558
about which you see here depicted as

668
00:32:02,558 --> 00:32:07,759
well and this stop codone is ex is is

669
00:32:05,558 --> 00:32:11,398
really nice and Powerful you get nearly

670
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:15,240
a a you know a transition from about 10%

671
00:32:11,398 --> 00:32:20,199
to almost 80% OIC acid with this single

672
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:22,440
uh point this single mutation in in that

673
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:25,038
uh in that

674
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:28,320
Gene and and this is what we've focused

675
00:32:25,038 --> 00:32:30,480
on and in fact we've done field trials

676
00:32:28,319 --> 00:32:32,720
and taken this through and as as you had

677
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:36,720
mentioned Lucia this is what we

678
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:39,919
registered in the UK as a UK variety and

679
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:42,480
not surprisingly then in that high line

680
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:46,080
there's really high levels of the fatty

681
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:48,440
acid in the triol glycerol the seed oil

682
00:32:46,079 --> 00:32:50,759
as well which is is reassuring compared

683
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:54,120
to the wild type where there's nothing

684
00:32:50,759 --> 00:32:57,638
and uh and then really interestingly

685
00:32:54,119 --> 00:32:59,759
things like hexanols which are you know

686
00:32:57,638 --> 00:33:02,839
some some of those molecules that that

687
00:32:59,759 --> 00:33:05,200
that are uh give you the SM the runid

688
00:33:02,839 --> 00:33:09,558
smell uh that when you when you look at

689
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:12,399
the phola wild type uh seed oil this is

690
00:33:09,558 --> 00:33:15,278
in head space analysis of the seed oil

691
00:33:12,398 --> 00:33:17,079
compared to the high variety you can see

692
00:33:15,278 --> 00:33:20,278
that this is more or less flatlining

693
00:33:17,079 --> 00:33:24,119
whereas these hexinol are really

694
00:33:20,278 --> 00:33:27,200
increasing in in Wild type phola seed so

695
00:33:24,119 --> 00:33:29,839
just just as further evidence of uh of

696
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:32,200
what's happened in terms of volatiles

697
00:33:29,839 --> 00:33:34,720
being emitted When you crush the seed

698
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:42,278
interestingly there's elevated levels of

699
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:44,679
uh of of uh Tofer rols in in the scap

700
00:33:42,278 --> 00:33:46,599
the high L variety and we don't really

701
00:33:44,679 --> 00:33:49,200
know why that is but you know these

702
00:33:46,599 --> 00:33:51,879
antioxidants are present in seed

703
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:54,600
obviously to protect the the the well

704
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:56,559
not obviously but assume because they're

705
00:33:54,599 --> 00:33:58,719
protecting the fatty acids from

706
00:33:56,558 --> 00:34:01,519
oxidation and if you don't have

707
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:04,399
polyunsaturated fatty acids in the cnap1

708
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:06,038
HOH maybe that maybe these tphols aren't

709
00:34:04,398 --> 00:34:07,719
being used up and there's just more of

710
00:34:06,038 --> 00:34:11,199
them but it it's just another

711
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:15,240
interesting uh statistically robust

712
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:18,358
trait and perhaps most interesting is

713
00:34:15,239 --> 00:34:20,719
that is that we we do this uh sort of

714
00:34:18,358 --> 00:34:22,598
Industry standard Ransom mat analysis

715
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:25,759
and if we just focus on the standard

716
00:34:22,599 --> 00:34:28,480
hemp and the scap one HOH and this is

717
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:30,599
the this is the projected stability in

718
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:34,320
months of the oil at three different

719
00:34:30,599 --> 00:34:37,000
temperatures 20° 4° and 0° you can see

720
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:41,559
this significant re significant increase

721
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:43,398
in the in the stability uh so at 20° it

722
00:34:41,559 --> 00:34:46,918
goes up to 10 months compared to 2

723
00:34:43,398 --> 00:34:51,440
months and at at 4° it's

724
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:53,878
going it's going from 4 months to 29

725
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:56,720
months so you can see and this is

726
00:34:53,878 --> 00:34:59,519
basically getting similar then to to

727
00:34:56,719 --> 00:35:01,838
Olive Oil and and similarly we're we're

728
00:34:59,519 --> 00:35:06,880
now doing a whole range of Industry

729
00:35:01,838 --> 00:35:10,078
related uh St uh you know food standards

730
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:12,838
for for this hemp oil and it

731
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:14,240
behaves uh very very similar to olive

732
00:35:12,838 --> 00:35:17,480
oil and so makes it very very

733
00:35:14,239 --> 00:35:20,879
interesting for a much wider

734
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:24,400
Market we got patent protection of this

735
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:25,920
in the US for that particular Al and uh

736
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:30,160
we have plant breeders rights in New

737
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:33,358
York we also uh been working with uh

738
00:35:30,159 --> 00:35:35,960
Partners in Canada and uh that's gone

739
00:35:33,358 --> 00:35:37,679
into the list of approved cultivars and

740
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:40,358
I just put this in which is taken from

741
00:35:37,679 --> 00:35:43,480
the Canadian government website uh where

742
00:35:40,358 --> 00:35:45,559
they grow they they they record where

743
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:48,000
where across all the different states in

744
00:35:45,559 --> 00:35:49,679
Canada uh that the different varieties

745
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,920
there's other varieties as well but this

746
00:35:49,679 --> 00:35:54,598
is fola which is one of the most popular

747
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:56,000
varieties in in Canada and it's grown

748
00:35:54,599 --> 00:35:59,480
across all these states and this

749
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:04,960
reflects that in Manitoba uh they they

750
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:06,719
were triing uh cenap 1 HOH in 2023 and

751
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:09,880
and they continue to be interested in

752
00:36:06,719 --> 00:36:12,118
this so so it it performs pretty well it

753
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:12,880
performs very similarly to fola in fact

754
00:36:12,119 --> 00:36:16,880
in the

755
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:19,960
field so I just wanted to mention uh if

756
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:23,640
I if I can this is my last trit that I

757
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:27,039
that I really like uh and so this is

758
00:36:23,639 --> 00:36:30,118
this is one of those Delta 15 uh this

759
00:36:27,039 --> 00:36:34,239
sorry this is one of the the other Delta

760
00:36:30,119 --> 00:36:37,240
12 the saturas mutations which we found

761
00:36:34,239 --> 00:36:39,519
for some unknown reason we don't really

762
00:36:37,239 --> 00:36:41,118
understand why but as well as

763
00:36:39,519 --> 00:36:44,000
producing

764
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:48,160
uh what it does is it elevates the

765
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:50,838
levels of Gamlin AIC acid and uh you can

766
00:36:48,159 --> 00:36:53,679
see here it's not you know it's not

767
00:36:50,838 --> 00:36:54,400
amazing but it takes it up to about 7%

768
00:36:53,679 --> 00:36:57,000
from

769
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:59,880
4% and and it may have something to do

770
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:02,480
with the way that this desaturase works

771
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:05,920
we've we we haven't managed to separate

772
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:09,559
this phenotype from the from this point

773
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:12,559
mutation in the desaturase the Delta 12

774
00:37:09,559 --> 00:37:15,039
desaturase and then what we did was we

775
00:37:12,559 --> 00:37:17,318
combined that mutation with the Delta 15

776
00:37:15,039 --> 00:37:21,599
desaturated mutation and we've managed

777
00:37:17,318 --> 00:37:25,119
to take this the levels of of Gamlin leg

778
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:28,000
acid up to about 11% which as you know

779
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:31,519
when I mentioned is is getting much more

780
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:33,880
interesting in terms of uh a a new GLA

781
00:37:31,519 --> 00:37:35,838
variety and we're in the process of of

782
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:37,960
trying to get variety registration for

783
00:37:35,838 --> 00:37:40,119
this vary because I think this can be

784
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:42,519
very very significant significant

785
00:37:40,119 --> 00:37:45,880
commercially as well it's not borage as

786
00:37:42,519 --> 00:37:49,480
I said which is 24% but when you compare

787
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:52,358
the yields that you get for for the hemp

788
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:55,480
crop compared to bage which is a really

789
00:37:52,358 --> 00:37:58,318
challenging crop to grow then per he per

790
00:37:55,480 --> 00:38:01,159
Hector it can be really getting there in

791
00:37:58,318 --> 00:38:03,599
terms of production of gla per Hector

792
00:38:01,159 --> 00:38:06,039
compared to to borage if you understand

793
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:09,160
what I'm saying so so this is the range

794
00:38:06,039 --> 00:38:11,719
of varieties that I've talked about I I

795
00:38:09,159 --> 00:38:13,759
I I hope I've convinced you that you can

796
00:38:11,719 --> 00:38:16,078
really do reverse genetics and get some

797
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:18,560
really nice interesting new traits out

798
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:20,240
of uh out of industrial hemp and there's

799
00:38:18,559 --> 00:38:22,679
plenty more could be done of course you

800
00:38:20,239 --> 00:38:24,118
could now use Gene editing but of course

801
00:38:22,679 --> 00:38:26,358
a lot of people still don't want to be

802
00:38:24,119 --> 00:38:28,200
doing Gene editing even with the

803
00:38:26,358 --> 00:38:30,519
technical challenges but but also the

804
00:38:28,199 --> 00:38:32,279
Regulatory and public acceptance

805
00:38:30,519 --> 00:38:34,800
challenges so this is still a nice way

806
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:37,040
to go I'm still a huge advocate for Gene

807
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:39,680
editing and GMOs and I would use it

808
00:38:37,039 --> 00:38:41,880
every time if I if I had a choice but

809
00:38:39,679 --> 00:38:44,719
just pointing out that this route is

810
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:46,960
still very very broad public acceptance

811
00:38:44,719 --> 00:38:50,199
all over the world that we've been

812
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:53,280
using so that's it uh these are the

813
00:38:50,199 --> 00:38:55,199
people K has really LED this for me

814
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:57,119
Monica was the postto at the time who

815
00:38:55,199 --> 00:38:58,759
was really on this project along with

816
00:38:57,119 --> 00:39:02,599
these other wonderful people we've had

817
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:05,359
funding from the from Au uh and from The

818
00:39:02,599 --> 00:39:07,640
Garfield Western Foundation charity and

819
00:39:05,358 --> 00:39:10,239
uh and from other bits and pieces that

820
00:39:07,639 --> 00:39:13,679
I've got over the years and so I think

821
00:39:10,239 --> 00:39:16,159
with that I'm very happy to stop and

822
00:39:13,679 --> 00:39:19,519
take questions I think I've just been

823
00:39:16,159 --> 00:39:21,480
running about 40 minutes so there I'll

824
00:39:19,519 --> 00:39:23,079
stop

825
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:26,760
sharing

826
00:39:23,079 --> 00:39:31,920
perfect thank you Yan we have some

827
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:35,280
questions in your in our Q&amp;A okay chat

828
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:38,920
um I'm sure we are going to have couple

829
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:40,599
more coming up yeah okay so the first

830
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:42,400
question I see is do you think we can

831
00:39:40,599 --> 00:39:44,559
increase the amount of oil apart from

832
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:49,838
modifying the proportions of the fatty

833
00:39:44,559 --> 00:39:51,119
acids uh very good question yes uh you

834
00:39:49,838 --> 00:39:54,199
know there's different ways you can

835
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:57,000
increase the the amount of oil

836
00:39:54,199 --> 00:39:59,358
typically uh you know if if you if you

837
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:01,480
just consider you know the amount of oil

838
00:39:59,358 --> 00:40:03,679
is yield per Hector you can you can

839
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:05,639
increase the amount of seed you can

840
00:40:03,679 --> 00:40:10,759
increase the size of the

841
00:40:05,639 --> 00:40:15,159
seed uh you know I think in with oil

842
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:18,119
crops that that ratio of oil to to to

843
00:40:15,159 --> 00:40:20,719
protein in the seed is is is much more

844
00:40:18,119 --> 00:40:23,519
fixed and and harder to do anything with

845
00:40:20,719 --> 00:40:26,519
so so the increasing the amount of oil

846
00:40:23,519 --> 00:40:28,800
is I I think in terms of and what we

847
00:40:26,519 --> 00:40:32,679
what we're doing in fact is now looking

848
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:36,000
at you know looking at more conventional

849
00:40:32,679 --> 00:40:41,358
breeding programs to to

850
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:43,199
increase uh to increase oil yield and

851
00:40:41,358 --> 00:40:46,199
there are other varieties for example

852
00:40:43,199 --> 00:40:48,759
that have got larger seed size than the

853
00:40:46,199 --> 00:40:50,799
phola variety and and uh so there's

854
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:54,160
various ways you can go about doing that

855
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:56,839
I hope that answers that question

856
00:40:54,159 --> 00:40:58,078
uh and I've got these are all Anonymous

857
00:40:56,838 --> 00:40:59,920
attendees

858
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:01,920
uh can change in fatty acid composition

859
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:04,920
have negative effects on seed

860
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:07,720
germination uh

861
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:10,000
no is the is the clear answer I I've

862
00:41:07,719 --> 00:41:13,559
done quite a bit on this in the past as

863
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:15,199
well uh because my when I started my lab

864
00:41:13,559 --> 00:41:17,119
the first thing I worked on was seed

865
00:41:15,199 --> 00:41:20,480
germination and and fatty acid

866
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:21,960
composition and during the '90s in fact

867
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:23,800
uh there was a really interesting

868
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:25,480
program that was funded by a company

869
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:28,519
called or worked on by a company called

870
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:32,400
cgen in in California and then by

871
00:41:28,519 --> 00:41:36,800
Monsanto where they actually made C12

872
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:38,599
lric acid in arabidopsis and in canola

873
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:40,720
and that's a really really different

874
00:41:38,599 --> 00:41:43,359
fatty acid and there were some

875
00:41:40,719 --> 00:41:45,239
challenges with that in terms of using

876
00:41:43,358 --> 00:41:46,719
it because basically what happens when

877
00:41:45,239 --> 00:41:48,879
you germinate seeds is of course the

878
00:41:46,719 --> 00:41:51,759
fatty acids are converted into sugars

879
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:55,559
and used to fuel growth uh but with all

880
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:57,560
of these fatty acids the the enzymes

881
00:41:55,559 --> 00:41:59,559
involved in fatty acid beta oxidation

882
00:41:57,559 --> 00:42:01,440
can cope with all of these different

883
00:41:59,559 --> 00:42:04,599
fatty acids quite easily and so that

884
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:06,920
conversion to to sugar is is not

885
00:42:04,599 --> 00:42:08,920
inhibited by and we don't see any impact

886
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:14,920
on of any of these on on seed

887
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:16,880
germination either uh so and danela uh

888
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:19,280
that that variety you registered where

889
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:21,400
is it been grown and how much of it is

890
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:24,119
been grown so basically I showed you

891
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:26,760
very quickly there we're really just get

892
00:42:24,119 --> 00:42:29,838
it's just getting traction now and uh I

893
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:33,200
showed you that that screenshot from

894
00:42:29,838 --> 00:42:35,519
that Government website in in Canada so

895
00:42:33,199 --> 00:42:38,239
it grows well in Canada it grows well in

896
00:42:35,519 --> 00:42:41,599
up up there in those higher latitudes

897
00:42:38,239 --> 00:42:46,719
maybe uh even even further north than

898
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:48,760
Upstate New York uh so uh that that's uh

899
00:42:46,719 --> 00:42:52,199
that's my bad sense of humor there

900
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:54,280
coming out uh but yeah so so it's it's

901
00:42:52,199 --> 00:42:57,358
at that stage where we're really

902
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:59,200
interested I think it it's the tra I

903
00:42:57,358 --> 00:43:03,119
think it's got huge potential because

904
00:42:59,199 --> 00:43:05,318
this this trait of holic acid you know

905
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:08,079
it's been it's it's now been introduced

906
00:43:05,318 --> 00:43:13,279
into soybean sunflow

907
00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:15,079
corn uh and canola and and Industry love

908
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:17,960
it you know the food industry love the

909
00:43:15,079 --> 00:43:21,400
trait because you know you can fry with

910
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:23,358
it and and and use it in food processing

911
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:25,000
I think hemp oil has got other

912
00:43:23,358 --> 00:43:28,039
advantages you know it's got a really

913
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:30,159
nice nutty flavor and and it's got a

914
00:43:28,039 --> 00:43:32,639
really it's really good for low impa

915
00:43:30,159 --> 00:43:35,639
impact farming and you know as I say my

916
00:43:32,639 --> 00:43:38,920
ambition is to is to really use this

917
00:43:35,639 --> 00:43:42,719
trck to get much better adoption of

918
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:45,880
industrial hemp in in by Farmers as well

919
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:46,799
so uh yeah so I hope that answers your

920
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:51,680
question

921
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:54,280
Daniela uh is and then another anonymous

922
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:56,598
attendee is oil from this variety being

923
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:58,240
sold in the UK not yet but I hope it

924
00:43:56,599 --> 00:44:00,760
will be

925
00:43:58,239 --> 00:44:02,279
soon are there seed oil traits or

926
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:04,960
compositions that could be used as

927
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:08,440
proxies for domestication syndrome

928
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:14,318
across different hemp or cannabis

929
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:16,599
varieties see sorry I what what I'm I'm

930
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:19,358
now because I'm not really a plant

931
00:44:16,599 --> 00:44:21,519
breeder I'm just I'm just uh pretending

932
00:44:19,358 --> 00:44:24,358
I'm one well what what an earth is

933
00:44:21,519 --> 00:44:24,358
domestication

934
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:30,318
syndrome can you tell me Lucia you're a

935
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:34,200
plant

936
00:44:30,318 --> 00:44:38,440
reader a exam question I think it's

937
00:44:34,199 --> 00:44:42,639
referring to all those uh different

938
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:45,639
trades um for example that they lose or

939
00:44:42,639 --> 00:44:48,239
they shatter less or that

940
00:44:45,639 --> 00:44:51,400
they okay so so all the other trats that

941
00:44:48,239 --> 00:44:52,959
you need to to to facilitate

942
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:56,318
domestication

943
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:59,920
uh I don't think so because you know uh

944
00:44:56,318 --> 00:45:03,400
pod chattering or or sea dropping and

945
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:05,559
and dorcy are all regulated by different

946
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:07,760
genes this these genes are really really

947
00:45:05,559 --> 00:45:10,240
really specific to fatty acid

948
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:12,880
composition

949
00:45:10,239 --> 00:45:15,239
uh oh gosh what would be the best fatty

950
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:18,119
acid profile for sustainable aviation

951
00:45:15,239 --> 00:45:19,919
fuel that's probably yeah I won't I

952
00:45:18,119 --> 00:45:23,720
won't start making any jokes about who

953
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:26,318
might be asking that question uh but uh

954
00:45:23,719 --> 00:45:29,239
so okay the best fatty acid composition

955
00:45:26,318 --> 00:45:31,679
for sust aviation fuel is more like C8

956
00:45:29,239 --> 00:45:36,039
and C10 fatty acids so much shorter

957
00:45:31,679 --> 00:45:37,838
chain fatty acids uh than than these and

958
00:45:36,039 --> 00:45:40,719
and I wouldn't I really wouldn't go near

959
00:45:37,838 --> 00:45:44,400
an aeroplane with uh polyunsaturated

960
00:45:40,719 --> 00:45:48,118
fatty acids uh because you know the

961
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:51,760
whole aviation fuel that oxygen is her

962
00:45:48,119 --> 00:45:57,559
you know and and desaturation is their

963
00:45:51,760 --> 00:46:00,200
enemy so uh yeah so

964
00:45:57,559 --> 00:46:02,440
uh yeah so C and and

965
00:46:00,199 --> 00:46:06,199
people I think you know that I mentioned

966
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:09,159
lric acid C12 and C10 that was played

967
00:46:06,199 --> 00:46:10,960
around with but and anyway they you

968
00:46:09,159 --> 00:46:14,558
would you would want really really high

969
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:17,880
yielding crop to to give you to give you

970
00:46:14,559 --> 00:46:20,280
aviation fuel and be competitive uh

971
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:22,800
whereas with with Industrial Hemp you're

972
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:27,400
looking at more at a higher value end of

973
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:28,880
the market than uh an aviation fuel uh

974
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:31,800
Did You observe any change in the

975
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:36,039
protein concentration uh

976
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:38,559
no uh and the and the either compos

977
00:46:36,039 --> 00:46:39,960
concentration or composition uh and as I

978
00:46:38,559 --> 00:46:42,519
mentioned because the fatty acid

979
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:46,240
composition of hemp protein is very

980
00:46:42,519 --> 00:46:48,960
interesting as well

981
00:46:46,239 --> 00:46:51,639
uh but is it commercially available not

982
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:53,760
yet we're in the process of

983
00:46:51,639 --> 00:46:58,558
commercializing yeah Danielle isn't

984
00:46:53,760 --> 00:47:01,400
giving up here so uh

985
00:46:58,559 --> 00:47:03,440
uh you speak screening genetically

986
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:06,519
diverse germplasm for unusual oil

987
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:09,480
profiles good so so this uh Zachary is

988
00:47:06,519 --> 00:47:11,358
asking about ger uh looking at germplasm

989
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:15,000
for unusual oil

990
00:47:11,358 --> 00:47:18,279
profiles uh very good question uh

991
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:20,960
Zachary we we haven't done much of that

992
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:21,880
because we haven't really had access to

993
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:25,639
a

994
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:28,760
huge uh germ plasm and there to be

995
00:47:25,639 --> 00:47:31,960
honest there isn't really a huge you

996
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:34,359
know diverse germ plasm of industrial

997
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:36,280
hemp varieties and you know we've looked

998
00:47:34,358 --> 00:47:40,159
at a few but we haven't seen anything

999
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:41,880
come out uh that gives you a different

1000
00:47:40,159 --> 00:47:43,920
fatty acid composition in the scene we

1001
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:45,559
haven't spotted anything in fact that

1002
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:50,240
that's different if doesn't mean it's

1003
00:47:45,559 --> 00:47:53,040
not there uh and then the last question

1004
00:47:50,239 --> 00:47:55,199
from Joy Beckerman any general claims

1005
00:47:53,039 --> 00:47:57,358
that are made re ham seed oil the most

1006
00:47:55,199 --> 00:47:59,719
prevalent being that there is a perfect

1007
00:47:57,358 --> 00:48:02,799
ratio of omega3 to

1008
00:47:59,719 --> 00:48:05,159
6 how accurate is such a statement and

1009
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:07,720
if one should apply a qualification to

1010
00:48:05,159 --> 00:48:09,759
it e generally speaking most varieties

1011
00:48:07,719 --> 00:48:13,118
provide a perfect ratio of Omega-3 to

1012
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:15,839
six what is the most appropriate oh good

1013
00:48:13,119 --> 00:48:19,200
question Joy I'm no Nutri I'm not a

1014
00:48:15,838 --> 00:48:24,000
nutritionist and I would never I would

1015
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:27,799
never uh assume that I was qualified to

1016
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:29,760
step what's the ideal Omega 3 to six

1017
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:31,200
composition because I think it depends

1018
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:34,280
on who you're speaking to to a

1019
00:48:31,199 --> 00:48:37,919
significant extent all I will say is

1020
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:41,480
that you know that ratio that you see in

1021
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:43,159
hemp in in in traditional hemp if I if I

1022
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:45,000
would call it and all of the varieties

1023
00:48:43,159 --> 00:48:49,480
that are out there it's pretty much

1024
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:51,760
fixed with that low amount of gla and

1025
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:55,000
much higher amount of

1026
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:58,680
AA because you could see that GLA and

1027
00:48:55,000 --> 00:49:03,880
and and and stonic acid are are very low

1028
00:48:58,679 --> 00:49:07,399
4 5% and uh and ala is much higher so so

1029
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:11,119
I I you know I

1030
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:14,480
I there there are applications where

1031
00:49:11,119 --> 00:49:17,240
people like that ratio of Omega 6 to

1032
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:22,519
omega3 but of course there is

1033
00:49:17,239 --> 00:49:26,239
also an industry need for for ala on its

1034
00:49:22,519 --> 00:49:28,599
own or GLA on its own and that's why if

1035
00:49:26,239 --> 00:49:30,558
I if I could go back that's why I'm

1036
00:49:28,599 --> 00:49:33,200
quite in that's why I'm quite excited

1037
00:49:30,559 --> 00:49:36,200
about the prospect of of developing a

1038
00:49:33,199 --> 00:49:40,239
variety which is not making

1039
00:49:36,199 --> 00:49:43,239
ala uh but is making significant amounts

1040
00:49:40,239 --> 00:49:46,118
of gla because when you take those two

1041
00:49:43,239 --> 00:49:48,919
oils and try and separate them in the

1042
00:49:46,119 --> 00:49:51,400
factory it's quite difficult to separate

1043
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:54,760
ala and gla whereas if you produce a

1044
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:57,720
variety which is just making GLA and and

1045
00:49:54,760 --> 00:50:00,760
and linolic acid then then for the

1046
00:49:57,719 --> 00:50:04,279
processing of that oil it's much easier

1047
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:08,880
to get pure GLA out

1048
00:50:04,280 --> 00:50:11,960
so uh and so industry often have

1049
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:14,920
requirements for that Downstream

1050
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:17,720
processing that that you that that are

1051
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:19,960
interesting targets as well so it's not

1052
00:50:17,719 --> 00:50:22,959
just the end user targets so I'm not

1053
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:25,400
triv trivializing the question at all I

1054
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:27,559
think there's you know it's it's a very

1055
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:30,720
good question and it depends on who

1056
00:50:27,559 --> 00:50:33,519
you're talking to and what what

1057
00:50:30,719 --> 00:50:36,838
nutrition uh what nutritionist you're

1058
00:50:33,519 --> 00:50:41,559
talking to

1059
00:50:36,838 --> 00:50:45,440
okay hit increasing liene from Andrea

1060
00:50:41,559 --> 00:50:48,040
Herman ah yeah like I I haven't really

1061
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:50,798
focused on that all I know is that what

1062
00:50:48,039 --> 00:50:54,759
I've read is that you know the ratio was

1063
00:50:50,798 --> 00:50:57,318
pretty good uh it's it's it's another

1064
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:59,400
job to increase life SC

1065
00:50:57,318 --> 00:51:02,039
uh increasing compounds like that you

1066
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:04,280
really need to upregulate biosynthesis

1067
00:51:02,039 --> 00:51:06,358
of them and that becomes a whole other

1068
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:09,280
challenge where you really do need to do

1069
00:51:06,358 --> 00:51:10,880
start thinking about doing uh well you

1070
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:15,400
could forward screen and see if you

1071
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:18,280
could do it but upregulating genes uh by

1072
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:21,639
by by Gene editing or GMO would be the

1073
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:21,640
way to go if you want to increase

1074
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:31,240
lysine awesome I think we got to the end

1075
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:33,720
of the list the questions thank you so

1076
00:51:31,239 --> 00:51:35,879
much Ian for your fantastic talk and

1077
00:51:33,719 --> 00:51:40,480
thank you for answering all our

1078
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:42,838
questions um for everyone yeah uh We've

1079
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:45,719
recorded the talk we're going to upload

1080
00:51:42,838 --> 00:51:48,558
it to our sips YouTube channel in the

1081
