this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:08,800
University hello my name is keny

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:11,120
Rodriguez I am a PhD student at Cornell

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:13,000
and I'm with Steve Riner a professor of

5
00:00:11,119 --> 00:00:15,518
horiculture and the Statewide vegetable

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,320
specialist at Corell and today we'll

7
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:20,679
talk about a practice that is usually

8
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,679
done in curits but we don't know if it

9
00:00:20,679 --> 00:00:25,039
is the right practices so Ste whenever

10
00:00:22,679 --> 00:00:26,800
we have a disease like downo people

11
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:29,000
think of pruning their plants do you

12
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,560
think this is a good practice and how is

13
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
it done sure

14
00:00:30,559 --> 00:00:33,600
there there's been a lot of chatter

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,520
about this in gardening websites

16
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,320
recently about going out and pruning

17
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,120
your your squash your your zucchini so

18
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,878
we've got some plants here now these are

19
00:00:40,119 --> 00:00:44,280
actually in really good shape but the

20
00:00:41,878 --> 00:00:46,640
idea of pruning would be that you want

21
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:48,399
to just leave the sort of newer growth

22
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,558
that's coming out you can see that right

23
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:52,719
in here so you don't want to touch that

24
00:00:50,558 --> 00:00:54,320
but it would be basically going down and

25
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:57,198
getting these older

26
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,480
leaves every went down here and getting

27
00:00:57,198 --> 00:01:00,599
getting those out of there now again

28
00:00:58,479 --> 00:01:02,640
these are in pretty good shape

29
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:04,960
um but normally these would have a lot

30
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,400
of mildew on it you could get those you

31
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:08,359
could throw them right into the compost

32
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,880
pile and get rid of it and you could do

33
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:12,359
even a little bit more here you could

34
00:01:09,879 --> 00:01:14,359
cut this um sometimes people are

35
00:01:12,359 --> 00:01:16,879
concerned that when you cut a leaf like

36
00:01:14,359 --> 00:01:18,799
that it leaves this big hole that you

37
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:22,280
can see right in there and the insects

38
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:23,320
could get in there and the reality is I

39
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:25,439
don't think there's going to be any

40
00:01:23,319 --> 00:01:27,078
insects that would cause a problem some

41
00:01:25,438 --> 00:01:29,359
insects might get in there could open it

42
00:01:27,078 --> 00:01:31,000
up for disease maybe but for the most

43
00:01:29,359 --> 00:01:32,920
part what's going to happen is by taking

44
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,759
these leaves off it's going to push all

45
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:38,399
of this new growth so again this is just

46
00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:41,359
a kind of a way to rejuvenate the plant

47
00:01:38,399 --> 00:01:43,239
um so that you can get more zucchini if

48
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:45,519
you really want more zucchini later in

49
00:01:43,239 --> 00:01:47,839
the year think about it too you've got

50
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:49,438
this big root system that's developed so

51
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,478
when you cut these leaves off you've got

52
00:01:49,438 --> 00:01:53,199
a lot of energy coming up from the roots

53
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:55,000
to push out these new leaves and you can

54
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,960
get you can get a nice Harvest then in

55
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,078
the

56
00:01:55,959 --> 00:02:01,839
fall is that a a practice that you would

57
00:01:59,078 --> 00:02:03,359
recommend and as a professor or I don't

58
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,520
I don't think so I'm just really wanted

59
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:08,878
to talk about it because people seem to

60
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:11,439
be recommending it more um it's never

61
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:12,799
done commercially so a farmer would

62
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:15,359
never want to do that and I'd also

63
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:17,040
recommend wear gloves and long sleeves

64
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,120
cuz these leaves can be uh a little

65
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:21,239
irritating on your arms and your hands

66
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:23,239
too okay so we just learned about

67
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:25,959
pruning and how is it done and the way

68
00:02:23,239 --> 00:02:28,640
that we can get more harvesty we need it

69
00:02:25,959 --> 00:02:30,360
