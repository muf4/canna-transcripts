1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:04,860
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,229 --> 00:00:04,859
University

3
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:17,539
very much I'd like to talk about my work

4
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:20,330
a little bit at first and then show you

5
00:00:17,539 --> 00:00:23,359
a few images of it you know my son Sam

6
00:00:20,329 --> 00:00:26,449
he's a just went to college this year

7
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:28,160
and when he was a child he had a kids

8
00:00:26,449 --> 00:00:30,649
book about three bears that encounter

9
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,539
urban sprawl and these bears they they

10
00:00:30,649 --> 00:00:34,878
went up over a hill near their den one

11
00:00:32,539 --> 00:00:37,460
morning they looked down somebody's

12
00:00:34,878 --> 00:00:39,349
built a shopping center overnight well

13
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:41,329
already people are hustling and bustling

14
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:43,910
up and down the sidewalk on they all

15
00:00:41,329 --> 00:00:45,140
look so satisfied well the little bears

16
00:00:43,909 --> 00:00:47,929
they're not sure they're happy anymore

17
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:49,579
so somewhere they find people clothes in

18
00:00:47,929 --> 00:00:51,768
the next sequence of pictures you see

19
00:00:49,579 --> 00:00:53,119
these little pint-sized figures moving

20
00:00:51,768 --> 00:00:55,189
amongst the legs of all the other

21
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:56,899
passers-by and the caption reads well

22
00:00:55,189 --> 00:00:59,359
now that they're like everybody else are

23
00:00:56,899 --> 00:01:01,488
they really happy well no not really

24
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:03,259
because underneath those people clothes

25
00:01:01,488 --> 00:01:06,140
still beat their furry little animal

26
00:01:03,259 --> 00:01:08,359
hearts luckily a big wind comes up it

27
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:10,760
blows into blows blows men's ties out

28
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:12,379
blows women's skirts up one big Gus

29
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:14,930
blows all the little bears clothes off

30
00:01:12,379 --> 00:01:17,149
and for the first time they realize who

31
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:18,950
and what they are man they go tearing

32
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:20,810
back across the parking lot back to a

33
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:23,359
place that they could just be themselves

34
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:25,010
and it wasn't so many years ago as the

35
00:01:23,359 --> 00:01:27,140
crow flies that I was getting ready for

36
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:29,840
work I had a coat and tie on in a

37
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:32,450
briefcase I start down my walkway and a

38
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,859
really big wind comes up and it blows in

39
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:36,109
it blows the first Gus blows my

40
00:01:33,859 --> 00:01:37,760
briefcase right down the street the

41
00:01:36,109 --> 00:01:41,329
second blows off my coat and tie the

42
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:43,400
third blows everything else away as I'm

43
00:01:41,329 --> 00:01:45,230
standing there completely amazed at this

44
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:47,450
unlikely turbulence in my life the only

45
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:49,370
thing I could feel under those people

46
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:52,040
clothes studying them an animal heart

47
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:53,600
and I have this flashback to all these

48
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:55,760
times in my life the only thing I could

49
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:57,679
think about was giving up my regular

50
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:59,780
life going off into the distance maybe

51
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:01,850
under the wilderness and building a

52
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:04,400
small cabin and living in a more

53
00:02:01,849 --> 00:02:06,169
essential way well there was a time of

54
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:09,019
change for me and I found myself at the

55
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:11,628
how to section of the library I saw

56
00:02:09,019 --> 00:02:13,340
things like load-bearing our factors and

57
00:02:11,628 --> 00:02:15,079
coefficients I said well you know

58
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:17,060
building a house even a small cabin

59
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:19,969
might be a whole lot harder than I

60
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:21,770
thought but luckily for me as I start

61
00:02:19,969 --> 00:02:24,199
back across the library I happen to

62
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:25,189
stumble on a big stack of national

63
00:02:24,199 --> 00:02:27,289
Geographics

64
00:02:25,189 --> 00:02:29,569
and maybe the first one I picked up was

65
00:02:27,289 --> 00:02:31,789
about the barrios in Rio de Janeiro in

66
00:02:29,569 --> 00:02:35,150
which a whole segment of the population

67
00:02:31,789 --> 00:02:37,159
the disenfranchised have to go out and

68
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:39,080
pick up the dendrite asst the castoffs

69
00:02:37,159 --> 00:02:41,210
of urban life and take that material

70
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:43,610
somewhere and build them a place to live

71
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:45,830
so I know I'm not supposed to like these

72
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:48,200
because these are really poor people and

73
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:51,050
yet they've done an amazing job with the

74
00:02:48,199 --> 00:02:53,179
material that they had at hand or maybe

75
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:55,460
it was a you know tribe from the amazon

76
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:57,860
basin who had to go into the jungle and

77
00:02:55,460 --> 00:03:00,140
forage whatever was available to build

78
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:01,790
the things they needed so I know these

79
00:03:00,139 --> 00:03:04,129
Hut's don't have any running water or

80
00:03:01,789 --> 00:03:07,219
electricity but they're beautiful and

81
00:03:04,129 --> 00:03:09,949
they look so good in the environment

82
00:03:07,219 --> 00:03:11,870
from which the material cane or maybe

83
00:03:09,949 --> 00:03:13,819
was a bird from africa that had done an

84
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:15,620
amazing engineering feat say well I know

85
00:03:13,819 --> 00:03:17,810
these birds are not smart enough to do

86
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:20,900
this but in human terms this would be

87
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:22,370
amazing craftsmanship so it was then I

88
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:24,860
realized that maybe I wasn't a normal

89
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:26,900
builder maybe I was more of a hunter and

90
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:29,120
gather some kind of an inspiration

91
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:30,590
builder and I did get started on that

92
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,599
house and I learned some things that

93
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:34,909
really held me in good stead in my art

94
00:03:32,599 --> 00:03:36,590
life and maybe the first is really the

95
00:03:34,909 --> 00:03:38,479
simplest it's learning to accept what

96
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:40,189
you do because if you don't know much

97
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:42,049
about building you put a window in the

98
00:03:40,189 --> 00:03:43,879
morning boy by noon you're totally

99
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:45,469
disgusted with yourself you want to take

100
00:03:43,879 --> 00:03:48,139
that thing right out of it right out

101
00:03:45,469 --> 00:03:50,359
again but to be fair to myself I decided

102
00:03:48,139 --> 00:03:52,699
that each day I would try to do the very

103
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:54,470
best job I could do at the end of the

104
00:03:52,699 --> 00:03:57,768
day I would accept my progress and the

105
00:03:54,469 --> 00:04:00,199
next day I would build on it the second

106
00:03:57,769 --> 00:04:02,420
thing is you use non-standard materials

107
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:04,399
like so many sculptors do you can't

108
00:04:02,419 --> 00:04:06,768
always go to Home Depot and Lowe's and

109
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:09,230
buy the things you need and similarly if

110
00:04:06,769 --> 00:04:10,610
you cut a big tree down and from the

111
00:04:09,229 --> 00:04:12,590
woods and decide to use it it's the

112
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:15,080
mainstay of your house how do you know

113
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:16,730
it would work and who would you ask well

114
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:19,430
I played a game with myself I call

115
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:21,560
giving it my one best shot and I said if

116
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:24,230
there's nobody left on earth what do I

117
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:25,730
think do I think it's strong enough so

118
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:27,680
somewhere along there I began accepting

119
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:31,220
responsibility for the kinds of things

120
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:33,280
that I designed and made the third thing

121
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:36,020
is working day in and day out in a very

122
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:37,189
unselfconscious way I begin to see what

123
00:04:36,019 --> 00:04:39,829
I liked and what I'd

124
00:04:37,189 --> 00:04:41,360
like I saw how important personal

125
00:04:39,829 --> 00:04:44,509
preferences in making those decisions

126
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:46,160
and over a period of time I began to

127
00:04:44,509 --> 00:04:49,159
develop my own sense of personal

128
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:51,410
aesthetic and finally I saw how

129
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:54,439
important need was in getting anything

130
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:56,210
done I really needed this house so it

131
00:04:54,439 --> 00:04:57,949
was able to coalesce my best energies

132
00:04:56,209 --> 00:04:59,870
and direct my best problem-solving

133
00:04:57,949 --> 00:05:01,610
skills and sometimes when I have a

134
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:04,009
sculptor friend who's not doing that

135
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:06,620
well with their work i'll say hey you

136
00:05:04,009 --> 00:05:07,819
have to figure out how to need it well I

137
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:10,399
didn't know it was getting out of hand

138
00:05:07,819 --> 00:05:12,110
my neighbors did and they were coming

139
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:14,239
over to my house as scratching their

140
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:16,939
head and kicking the dirt and a friend

141
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:18,650
Brooks brought us you know relative from

142
00:05:16,939 --> 00:05:20,389
another area the country and he said I

143
00:05:18,649 --> 00:05:23,569
really like what you're doing here

144
00:05:20,389 --> 00:05:24,919
you're a real artist well maybe for all

145
00:05:23,569 --> 00:05:27,680
of you that be a great thing for

146
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:29,480
somebody to say about you but for me it

147
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,780
felt like the edge of the earth and I

148
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:34,970
really wanted him to take it back and

149
00:05:31,779 --> 00:05:36,949
upon reflection I realized that as a

150
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:39,230
child I thought being an artist was the

151
00:05:36,949 --> 00:05:41,060
greatest thing you could be the only

152
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:43,009
trouble was it came with this enormous

153
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:44,240
sense of personal responsibility you

154
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:46,519
were supposed to do something great

155
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:49,160
something earth-shaking something that

156
00:05:46,519 --> 00:05:51,079
saved people and it seemed like it was

157
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:52,780
connected with that onerous word talent

158
00:05:51,079 --> 00:05:55,490
somehow you were supposed to be talented

159
00:05:52,779 --> 00:05:57,259
well I knew what the word talent and art

160
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:59,780
had to do with Michelangelo and Leonardo

161
00:05:57,259 --> 00:06:02,689
da Vinci I just couldn't figure out what

162
00:05:59,779 --> 00:06:05,209
it had to do with me or anything I was

163
00:06:02,689 --> 00:06:07,759
doing it my house so one shimmering

164
00:06:05,209 --> 00:06:09,649
moment I found myself at the nearest art

165
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:11,930
department and rolling in our history

166
00:06:09,649 --> 00:06:14,299
courses and sculpture and you know for

167
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:16,490
me that minute that day was the best day

168
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:18,680
of my life because I didn't know there

169
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:20,180
was anybody else like me I didn't know

170
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:22,459
there were lots of people who liked

171
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:24,829
material who like just handling it who

172
00:06:22,459 --> 00:06:27,289
like seeing their ideas get worked out

173
00:06:24,829 --> 00:06:29,418
in three dimension the only trouble was

174
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:31,970
I was an art nerd and so I'd walk around

175
00:06:29,418 --> 00:06:33,589
and I'd say is this art is this art how

176
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:36,230
come this person gets to paint this

177
00:06:33,589 --> 00:06:38,000
board blue and call it art that's just

178
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:40,069
about the whole fourth again when the

179
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,379
professor grabs me by the thread starts

180
00:06:40,069 --> 00:06:43,849
choking me to death and he said who in

181
00:06:42,379 --> 00:06:45,529
the hell cares if it's art or not why

182
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:47,090
don't just go in there and make

183
00:06:45,529 --> 00:06:48,739
something make whatever you're going to

184
00:06:47,089 --> 00:06:51,019
make who's going to know the difference

185
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:53,030
in 20 years anyway

186
00:06:51,019 --> 00:06:55,788
and you know I needed that permission

187
00:06:53,029 --> 00:06:58,098
giving and I learned some things while I

188
00:06:55,788 --> 00:07:01,250
was in school that I think help towards

189
00:06:58,098 --> 00:07:04,550
my propel me to become a working artist

190
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:06,829
and maybe the first is the importance of

191
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:09,079
a role model because I didn't know if

192
00:07:06,829 --> 00:07:11,029
you had to have a psychiatrist standing

193
00:07:09,079 --> 00:07:12,740
by when you made your first piece or

194
00:07:11,029 --> 00:07:14,809
whether you you know had to have some

195
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:16,189
kind of great family of people like

196
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:18,408
getting a divorce or leaving your

197
00:07:16,189 --> 00:07:20,089
boyfriend or girlfriend or maybe you had

198
00:07:18,408 --> 00:07:22,639
to go to New York and work as a waiter

199
00:07:20,089 --> 00:07:25,158
in order to qualify and it wasn't until

200
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:26,810
I saw these relatively normal people who

201
00:07:25,158 --> 00:07:28,908
were really compelled about making

202
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:31,519
things that I realized there was going

203
00:07:28,908 --> 00:07:33,709
to be some hope for me the second thing

204
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:35,299
is that it's hard to be a food baddest

205
00:07:33,709 --> 00:07:37,788
unless there are other people around who

206
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:39,259
eat beans and rice and similarly it's

207
00:07:37,788 --> 00:07:40,519
hard to be a working artists unless

208
00:07:39,259 --> 00:07:42,500
there are other people around who

209
00:07:40,519 --> 00:07:44,779
understand what you're going through and

210
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:47,300
the biggest my biggest challenges of

211
00:07:44,779 --> 00:07:49,549
working artist is is to maintain a sense

212
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:51,860
of personal equilibrium and this is

213
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:54,530
somewhat difficult in our society that

214
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:57,169
gives high marks to culture but really

215
00:07:54,529 --> 00:07:59,568
ignores individual makers and it's easy

216
00:07:57,168 --> 00:08:01,158
to have an identity crisis at any time

217
00:07:59,569 --> 00:08:02,780
in your career in which you walk in your

218
00:08:01,158 --> 00:08:05,149
studio one morning and you can't

219
00:08:02,779 --> 00:08:06,709
remember who made that work and it's

220
00:08:05,149 --> 00:08:08,839
then you're glad that they're use a

221
00:08:06,709 --> 00:08:10,609
university art department around or that

222
00:08:08,839 --> 00:08:12,739
you have a friend at a distance that you

223
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:15,770
can call it say hey Scott are you still

224
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:18,949
working and some sometime how when he

225
00:08:15,769 --> 00:08:21,649
says he is you're able to and you can

226
00:08:18,949 --> 00:08:24,199
just go right on with it the third thing

227
00:08:21,649 --> 00:08:26,060
that I began to see is there's a big

228
00:08:24,199 --> 00:08:28,158
difference between doers and viewers

229
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:31,129
between people who make things and

230
00:08:28,158 --> 00:08:33,528
people who look at them seriously and my

231
00:08:31,129 --> 00:08:35,479
mind there were two different jobs you

232
00:08:33,528 --> 00:08:37,668
know museum directors and curators and

233
00:08:35,479 --> 00:08:39,979
gallery owners there their job is to

234
00:08:37,668 --> 00:08:43,399
decide what object or person is more

235
00:08:39,979 --> 00:08:45,079
inherently interesting than another you

236
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:46,909
know that's not my job I have to be true

237
00:08:45,078 --> 00:08:49,370
to my materials and true to my ideas a

238
00:08:46,909 --> 00:08:51,769
lot of times when I started work I don't

239
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:53,870
even know what I'm doing and if I had to

240
00:08:51,769 --> 00:08:55,189
worry about whether was good or not or

241
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:57,500
whether it was art historically

242
00:08:55,190 --> 00:09:00,649
significant I would really never get

243
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:02,389
started so that the fourth thing is that

244
00:09:00,649 --> 00:09:04,499
I had to deal with that word talent and

245
00:09:02,389 --> 00:09:07,019
although I decided to tell it was in

246
00:09:04,499 --> 00:09:09,178
irrelevant it just wasn't the issue I

247
00:09:07,019 --> 00:09:11,339
had the right to make what I wanted

248
00:09:09,178 --> 00:09:14,068
whatever you know as much as I wanted

249
00:09:11,339 --> 00:09:18,059
basically I could do as much artwork as

250
00:09:14,068 --> 00:09:21,208
I could afford so at some shimmering

251
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:23,698
moment I decided to go home build a

252
00:09:21,208 --> 00:09:25,078
studio and get to work now it's one

253
00:09:23,698 --> 00:09:26,728
thing that you know that you have the

254
00:09:25,078 --> 00:09:28,078
right to make something it's another

255
00:09:26,729 --> 00:09:29,699
thing to know what you're going to make

256
00:09:28,078 --> 00:09:32,338
and how you're going to make it and

257
00:09:29,698 --> 00:09:34,858
luckily for me I kept up with the

258
00:09:32,339 --> 00:09:36,599
University I went to a see a lecture by

259
00:09:34,859 --> 00:09:38,579
a woman named Marty zelt who had been a

260
00:09:36,599 --> 00:09:39,989
seamstress in her life before sculpture

261
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:42,628
and she brought to her sculpture work

262
00:09:39,989 --> 00:09:44,849
velcro fasteners and zippers and cloth

263
00:09:42,629 --> 00:09:47,399
and I'm leaving that lecture I say I

264
00:09:44,849 --> 00:09:49,679
wonder what I already know I wonder what

265
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:51,808
simple method of joining some simple

266
00:09:49,678 --> 00:09:53,399
method of technology that I might

267
00:09:51,808 --> 00:09:56,428
already be familiar with in us I'm

268
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:58,918
driving back home to my house I'm seeing

269
00:09:56,428 --> 00:10:00,688
all these saplings alongside the road

270
00:09:58,918 --> 00:10:04,019
where maintenance crews are constantly

271
00:10:00,688 --> 00:10:06,208
striving to keep them down and much like

272
00:10:04,019 --> 00:10:08,188
Saul being struck off his horse on the

273
00:10:06,208 --> 00:10:11,548
way to Damascus I have an epiphany sigh

274
00:10:08,188 --> 00:10:13,288
say hey maybe I could use those well it

275
00:10:11,548 --> 00:10:15,208
wasn't so unusual that a woodsman like

276
00:10:13,288 --> 00:10:17,369
myself would see the potential of the

277
00:10:15,208 --> 00:10:20,068
saplings along his driveway because

278
00:10:17,369 --> 00:10:21,809
they're plentiful their renewable just

279
00:10:20,068 --> 00:10:24,389
like having a giant warehouse at your

280
00:10:21,808 --> 00:10:26,519
fingertips and after working with this

281
00:10:24,389 --> 00:10:28,889
material for a while I realized that I

282
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:31,078
had a deeper resonance with it I'd grown

283
00:10:28,889 --> 00:10:33,209
up in the woodlands of North Carolina we

284
00:10:31,078 --> 00:10:35,878
have lots of underbrush and intersecting

285
00:10:33,208 --> 00:10:38,338
lines and as some kids late in fields

286
00:10:35,879 --> 00:10:40,889
and looked at the architectural details

287
00:10:38,339 --> 00:10:42,629
of clouds I found myself studying the

288
00:10:40,889 --> 00:10:44,519
drawing quality of the winter landscape

289
00:10:42,629 --> 00:10:46,589
all those hatch marks in the trees all

290
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:49,470
those imagined faces surrounded by

291
00:10:46,589 --> 00:10:51,299
branches up there so when I turned a

292
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:53,428
sculpture it seemed easy to co-opt the

293
00:10:51,298 --> 00:10:56,220
forces of nature and play all that

294
00:10:53,428 --> 00:11:00,028
natural drawings I'll add on to these

295
00:10:56,220 --> 00:11:02,839
larger works the thing I had to cope

296
00:11:00,028 --> 00:11:06,688
with and find out about was that that

297
00:11:02,839 --> 00:11:08,819
you know what that sticks had an

298
00:11:06,688 --> 00:11:11,248
inherent method of joining this is what

299
00:11:08,818 --> 00:11:13,828
beavers and birds already know and that

300
00:11:11,249 --> 00:11:15,899
if you pull a stick through the woods

301
00:11:13,828 --> 00:11:17,079
your start out pulling it but more or

302
00:11:15,899 --> 00:11:19,059
less you start really jar

303
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:21,670
and long after a while in it other words

304
00:11:19,059 --> 00:11:23,199
it's got this an infuriating tendency to

305
00:11:21,669 --> 00:11:24,909
tangle with other stuff and that's

306
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:27,460
really the simplest method of joining

307
00:11:24,909 --> 00:11:29,079
and every stick has a little flexibility

308
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:31,600
if you flex it and you pull it through a

309
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:35,050
matrix and let it go it kind of snaps

310
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:36,879
back and holds itself in place that's

311
00:11:35,049 --> 00:11:38,349
kind of the how but to what if you had

312
00:11:36,879 --> 00:11:40,840
seen me at the time I could probably

313
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:43,720
spend five minutes in a museum before

314
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:45,430
running down the steps with sweaty palms

315
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:49,330
and going I think they've used all the

316
00:11:45,429 --> 00:11:50,769
good ideas up or you read a magazine in

317
00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:53,920
art magazine you think they'd be

318
00:11:50,769 --> 00:11:55,720
exploited every material or you find out

319
00:11:53,919 --> 00:11:58,179
that in the last census over a million

320
00:11:55,720 --> 00:12:00,550
people in New York City alone claimed to

321
00:11:58,179 --> 00:12:03,399
be visual artists you say whoa there are

322
00:12:00,549 --> 00:12:05,409
too many of us but you know I love to

323
00:12:03,399 --> 00:12:07,980
make things and so I just decided the

324
00:12:05,409 --> 00:12:10,600
art world was going to have to lump it

325
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:12,970
you know what I say about my work is

326
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:15,399
that I I make temporary work which I

327
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:17,889
built on site from materials that I

328
00:12:15,399 --> 00:12:19,899
gather somewhere nearby and one of the

329
00:12:17,889 --> 00:12:21,909
unique aspects of my work is that

330
00:12:19,899 --> 00:12:24,039
there's no studio doors to close in no

331
00:12:21,909 --> 00:12:26,829
place to hide I'm out there in public

332
00:12:24,039 --> 00:12:29,709
view and the public sees the good and

333
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:32,530
the bad of it as I go you know when i'm

334
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:35,290
on site I like representing making in a

335
00:12:32,529 --> 00:12:37,659
positive way I like interceding for the

336
00:12:35,289 --> 00:12:40,569
Arts and I like demystifying the process

337
00:12:37,659 --> 00:12:42,909
but mainly I like reminding people that

338
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:44,530
artists are just normal people who are

339
00:12:42,909 --> 00:12:47,589
looking for their rightful place in the

340
00:12:44,529 --> 00:12:52,929
world of work so I'd like to show you a

341
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:56,080
few slides a few images that I have some

342
00:12:52,929 --> 00:13:04,389
of my house and some otherwise let's see

343
00:12:56,080 --> 00:13:05,800
if you turn the lights down for me I was

344
00:13:04,389 --> 00:13:08,100
lucky enough to be able to put some

345
00:13:05,799 --> 00:13:11,319
slides of the piece here and and Cornell

346
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:13,840
in the work so first of all I'd like to

347
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:16,300
show you a few pictures of my house you

348
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:18,820
know I live in a small house but the

349
00:13:16,299 --> 00:13:22,240
reason I do is because i tried to use

350
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:24,040
only recycle materials in it i tried to

351
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:27,190
use the smallest footprint i could

352
00:13:24,039 --> 00:13:29,500
possibly get so that i could this live

353
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:30,670
sustainably i've tried to work really

354
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:33,909
hard myself

355
00:13:30,669 --> 00:13:37,929
it being you know extending the kind of

356
00:13:33,909 --> 00:13:41,350
environmental message abusing less these

357
00:13:37,929 --> 00:13:44,949
stones I dug in the backyard and and put

358
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:46,720
them into my wall they're not quite as

359
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:48,550
good at the bottom better at the top

360
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:54,070
because I got better as I started

361
00:13:48,549 --> 00:13:55,719
working the inside is this is the better

362
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:57,460
stones you always sequence your

363
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:59,800
materials and I do the same thing with

364
00:13:57,460 --> 00:14:01,780
my stick work I put the bad sticks

365
00:13:59,799 --> 00:14:04,269
underneath and the good sticks on top in

366
00:14:01,779 --> 00:14:05,949
this case the worst stones went on the

367
00:14:04,269 --> 00:14:11,799
outside of the wall the best ones went

368
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:13,930
inside I throughout the various roof of

369
00:14:11,799 --> 00:14:16,899
my house I've got all this cedar split

370
00:14:13,929 --> 00:14:20,019
out that I got from my woods and you

371
00:14:16,899 --> 00:14:22,870
know I really like the idea of extending

372
00:14:20,019 --> 00:14:24,189
your landscape into your house and to be

373
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:28,179
able to look out windows on all sides

374
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:29,380
and see the forest outside and and also

375
00:14:28,179 --> 00:14:31,509
something that doesn't have to be

376
00:14:29,379 --> 00:14:35,230
painted that's always kind of just

377
00:14:31,509 --> 00:14:37,149
maintains itself I've built a million

378
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:38,889
sheds for myself and other people this

379
00:14:37,149 --> 00:14:41,799
one was built from all the material that

380
00:14:38,889 --> 00:14:43,870
I cut where I put my house and the thing

381
00:14:41,799 --> 00:14:46,659
even though it's been quite some time

382
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:49,690
because this stand this shed still

383
00:14:46,659 --> 00:14:51,039
stands it looks pretty good and of

384
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:52,810
course I had to build a monument to

385
00:14:51,039 --> 00:14:55,599
myself because I was afraid no one would

386
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:58,689
build it to me and this is a big laid up

387
00:14:55,600 --> 00:15:02,769
stone monument about eight by eight that

388
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:05,800
sits out in front of my yard I like good

389
00:15:02,769 --> 00:15:08,919
stone work it this has got no mortar in

390
00:15:05,799 --> 00:15:11,729
it it's basically a combination of

391
00:15:08,919 --> 00:15:13,870
features stones and little goodies and

392
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:16,360
of course my neighbors were always

393
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:17,769
providing inspiration in this case it's

394
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:20,470
called waiting it out in Maple they were

395
00:15:17,769 --> 00:15:22,539
telling me what their kids left home of

396
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:25,899
course things would be better in their

397
00:15:22,539 --> 00:15:27,969
lives so I have a lot of neighbors so I

398
00:15:25,899 --> 00:15:33,039
I put this out in the front so they

399
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:34,570
could see themselves and I just wanted

400
00:15:33,039 --> 00:15:38,349
to show you a little bit about material

401
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:39,970
this is materials outside my my studio

402
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:42,159
and if you look at these pieces you

403
00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:43,570
think the lines must go on forever but a

404
00:15:42,159 --> 00:15:43,929
lot of the lines we're using are really

405
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:46,240
sure

406
00:15:43,929 --> 00:15:49,539
sticks and your eyes making the jump

407
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:51,970
between one line and another my friend

408
00:15:49,539 --> 00:15:53,559
Scott and we're about to bring material

409
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:57,570
into this gallery and start at work

410
00:15:53,559 --> 00:16:02,049
where it's a dissing subtraction problem

411
00:15:57,570 --> 00:16:03,730
this was at an Indianapolis at the Heron

412
00:16:02,049 --> 00:16:06,519
school they always look for material

413
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:08,620
somewhere they're not going to be used

414
00:16:06,519 --> 00:16:10,778
sometimes I'm beating the bulldozer to

415
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:13,480
the stick in this case the city is

416
00:16:10,778 --> 00:16:16,539
expanding its golf course and we were

417
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:19,600
able to cut these nice maples prior to

418
00:16:16,539 --> 00:16:22,449
the bulldozer arriving now this is a

419
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:24,639
piece and I mean this is out in Wyoming

420
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:27,730
somebody had the thought that if they

421
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:29,769
took a bulldozer to the willow in their

422
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:32,830
lake that they would have less willow

423
00:16:29,769 --> 00:16:34,600
which was a really a bad move so we were

424
00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:37,860
able to go out and continue to collect

425
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:41,440
endless trailer loads of willow there

426
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:44,470
this is on in Maui on the side of the

427
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:48,790
volcano we're gathering strawberry guava

428
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:51,220
and and eucalyptus trees and some of the

429
00:16:48,789 --> 00:16:53,559
hills were on there so steep that you

430
00:16:51,220 --> 00:17:00,220
have to use a rope to climb to climb up

431
00:16:53,559 --> 00:17:03,669
them to cut in a end up in Ireland we

432
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:05,980
gathered at a biomass farm and we

433
00:17:03,669 --> 00:17:09,009
gathered willow and so this is a way

434
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:11,890
that sometimes we load and get things to

435
00:17:09,009 --> 00:17:14,769
be brought over to the site and finally

436
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:17,350
here's a lot of leaks that's this was a

437
00:17:14,769 --> 00:17:19,449
in richmond virginia at a botanic garden

438
00:17:17,349 --> 00:17:21,938
there the Louis beginner botanic and

439
00:17:19,449 --> 00:17:23,709
this just a big these are our structural

440
00:17:21,939 --> 00:17:26,650
pieces laying on the ground and then we

441
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:29,590
had loads and loads of these smaller

442
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:32,320
branches at which we used and this is us

443
00:17:29,589 --> 00:17:35,199
working on that piece and that this was

444
00:17:32,319 --> 00:17:37,779
the final piece it was 11 pieces set in

445
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:39,880
a grid they're all diamond-shaped and so

446
00:17:37,779 --> 00:17:41,230
you can go in the piece and then go in

447
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:43,990
further it so there's kind of three

448
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:45,940
levels of little little huts to go

449
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:48,339
through I just wanted to show you

450
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:51,070
something from start to finish this is

451
00:17:48,339 --> 00:17:53,019
an Ireland this is a willow farm and you

452
00:17:51,069 --> 00:17:55,178
know every time you cut one of these

453
00:17:53,019 --> 00:17:57,190
stools you get twice as many sticks so

454
00:17:55,179 --> 00:17:57,730
the stools are good for about 40 years

455
00:17:57,190 --> 00:17:59,140
that

456
00:17:57,730 --> 00:18:02,920
what I hear you all probably know truly

457
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:04,900
how long that lasts but so you know

458
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:06,340
willow is a great vendor but it's not

459
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:10,210
the only one up and down the east coast

460
00:18:06,339 --> 00:18:15,159
lots of maple just lots of different

461
00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:16,870
things that can be is usable in my this

462
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:18,790
is we always have to get the materials

463
00:18:16,869 --> 00:18:21,669
over to the site in this case the city

464
00:18:18,789 --> 00:18:23,769
sent a truck this is Tala community art

465
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:25,269
center I'm always interested in trying

466
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:27,359
to build something where people can

467
00:18:25,269 --> 00:18:29,740
really see it they were concerned that

468
00:18:27,359 --> 00:18:32,500
since they're more than leprechauns in

469
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:34,329
Ireland there's a lot of crime in this

470
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:35,740
at particular area outside of Dublin

471
00:18:34,329 --> 00:18:38,019
then they were afraid somebody was going

472
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:40,180
to knock the piece down I decided to use

473
00:18:38,019 --> 00:18:42,309
this tree as a center core for it and

474
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:43,870
also to use a binocular kind of

475
00:18:42,309 --> 00:18:46,119
architecture that the people that are

476
00:18:43,869 --> 00:18:49,449
familiar with was his Irish round tower

477
00:18:46,119 --> 00:18:51,789
from the 8th to the 10th century the

478
00:18:49,450 --> 00:18:54,819
monks bill these egg me dig mattock

479
00:18:51,789 --> 00:18:57,339
kind of towers and so this was my stick

480
00:18:54,819 --> 00:19:01,119
tower of talla it's about 42 feet tall

481
00:18:57,339 --> 00:19:03,129
and then this was a two years later when

482
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:05,169
the piece is about to come down so the

483
00:19:03,130 --> 00:19:07,600
living limbs were outside the tree trunk

484
00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:10,360
and then it just so happens that the

485
00:19:07,599 --> 00:19:13,119
tree had been trimmed so that it exactly

486
00:19:10,359 --> 00:19:16,629
took a kind of circularity of the tower

487
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:20,349
and so we were able to pull it off this

488
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:22,840
here is an Ithaca this is another great

489
00:19:20,349 --> 00:19:24,789
gathering site I know some people here

490
00:19:22,839 --> 00:19:26,949
in the audience help me there they know

491
00:19:24,789 --> 00:19:30,159
very well where this is but this is a

492
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:32,019
great stand of sticks we always have the

493
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:34,870
problem of hauling those sticks back to

494
00:19:32,019 --> 00:19:36,609
our site this was over in front of the

495
00:19:34,869 --> 00:19:38,139
Performing Arts Center and between there

496
00:19:36,609 --> 00:19:40,029
in the dorm we wanted to make a

497
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:42,750
companion piece for each one of these

498
00:19:40,029 --> 00:19:45,339
locust trees you can see that we've

499
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:47,079
taken and spray-painted or somebody

500
00:19:45,339 --> 00:19:49,869
spray-painted for us so we knew where

501
00:19:47,079 --> 00:19:51,490
all the power lines electric lines and

502
00:19:49,869 --> 00:19:54,399
things were under there they allowed us

503
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:55,960
to drill into the into this Plaza

504
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:59,320
because they were going to replace some

505
00:19:55,960 --> 00:20:02,410
of the concrete anyway so I try to make

506
00:19:59,319 --> 00:20:03,849
a small drawing about how each one of

507
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:08,230
these seven pieces we're going to

508
00:20:03,849 --> 00:20:11,259
interact with the tree then I laid out

509
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:13,990
the piece by drawing picture

510
00:20:11,259 --> 00:20:16,269
a footprint of the piece and then

511
00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:19,390
drilled holes where over the dots are

512
00:20:16,269 --> 00:20:22,180
they're allowing us to put these

513
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:24,250
structural pieces down in the ground so

514
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:27,340
that they could help hold the whole

515
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:30,039
piece up set a scaffolding system around

516
00:20:27,339 --> 00:20:33,839
those uprights and then pull the shape

517
00:20:30,039 --> 00:20:36,159
we want over and then kind of work on a

518
00:20:33,839 --> 00:20:39,279
structural crust on top of these things

519
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:42,420
and start really building the sculpture

520
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:45,569
from there and we had quite an elaborate

521
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:49,050
scaffolding system pretty high for as

522
00:20:45,569 --> 00:20:51,549
things go and then this was our final

523
00:20:49,049 --> 00:20:53,440
ideal the day of the opening well I

524
00:20:51,549 --> 00:20:56,349
really appreciated all the help I had

525
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:59,110
here we had a fantastic crew and it

526
00:20:56,349 --> 00:21:01,899
really went well I wanted to show you

527
00:20:59,109 --> 00:21:04,809
how I work and this is at the college of

528
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:06,970
art and design and Savannah this is the

529
00:21:04,809 --> 00:21:08,409
old county jail when I thought about a

530
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:10,870
piece for the county jail I thought

531
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:13,450
about escape hatches and maybe flying

532
00:21:10,869 --> 00:21:15,129
carpets way to get out of jail but I

533
00:21:13,450 --> 00:21:16,900
just wanted to show you how it works so

534
00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:18,460
first thing is that I work structurally

535
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:20,710
whether it goes in the ground in this

536
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:23,170
case i wove into the jail bars of the

537
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:24,850
old county jail and I've got this

538
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:27,070
platform lift and I'm driving back and

539
00:21:24,849 --> 00:21:30,309
forth and I kind of make a structural

540
00:21:27,069 --> 00:21:32,439
base and so that it will hold on it it's

541
00:21:30,309 --> 00:21:34,179
like making a canvas and then drawing so

542
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:36,730
the next phase is to kind of

543
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:39,160
aestheticizing so as I'm starting to

544
00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:41,650
come up and bring the image up I'm

545
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:43,990
making these big circularity and I'm

546
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:46,330
just hanging the sticks on my structural

547
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:48,789
base so that in a way that they look

548
00:21:46,329 --> 00:21:51,069
good I think mainly of how it looks at

549
00:21:48,789 --> 00:21:53,049
this second phase and the third thing is

550
00:21:51,069 --> 00:21:54,970
to kind of build the cosmetics of it to

551
00:21:53,049 --> 00:21:57,750
go back and to fix up you don't see any

552
00:21:54,970 --> 00:22:00,549
cut ends you don't see any discs

553
00:21:57,750 --> 00:22:03,039
anything that interrupts the I these big

554
00:22:00,549 --> 00:22:05,980
white lines are whipping around and so

555
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:08,500
it thoroughly makes a kind of great

556
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:11,680
illusion of movement and and kind of

557
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:13,390
natural forces I wanted to talk about my

558
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:16,330
work in terms of temporary because I do

559
00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:18,820
temporary work and work usually one good

560
00:22:16,329 --> 00:22:20,589
year maybe a pretty good year and so I

561
00:22:18,819 --> 00:22:23,349
would say the line between trash and

562
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:25,089
treasure is very thin with sticks so at

563
00:22:23,349 --> 00:22:27,759
window piece starts looking to

564
00:22:25,089 --> 00:22:29,980
then it's time to take it down this is a

565
00:22:27,759 --> 00:22:31,390
pink and white dogwood I've bent the

566
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:34,059
branches down a little bit at a time

567
00:22:31,390 --> 00:22:35,890
over several days I built this kind of

568
00:22:34,059 --> 00:22:39,639
container form that went on top of the

569
00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:42,009
dogwood and then it bloomed out it was

570
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:44,200
look really pretty and then the leaves

571
00:22:42,009 --> 00:22:46,150
came out on the surface of the of the

572
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:48,190
piece and I knew that I just had three

573
00:22:46,150 --> 00:22:50,050
months it could only stay on there for

574
00:22:48,190 --> 00:22:53,200
three months we had talked to a arborist

575
00:22:50,049 --> 00:22:55,480
ahead of time and so at a point it had

576
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,980
to come down and in this case my friend

577
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:59,769
of mine and I were going to hook it to

578
00:22:56,980 --> 00:23:01,539
his car and drag it to the dump so we

579
00:22:59,769 --> 00:23:04,660
were just dragging the sculpture right

580
00:23:01,539 --> 00:23:07,990
down the street this was at Swarthmore

581
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:09,640
College and the opportunity to work on a

582
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:13,210
tree that was going to be taken down in

583
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:15,880
two years and so this is a because of

584
00:23:13,210 --> 00:23:17,559
you had this strong vertical a tree with

585
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:19,930
limbs on one side and no limbs on the

586
00:23:17,559 --> 00:23:22,179
other you could weave into the limbs on

587
00:23:19,930 --> 00:23:23,830
one side in and contrast it with this

588
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:28,299
strong vertical it was called

589
00:23:23,829 --> 00:23:30,569
abracadabra and it's about 45 feet tall

590
00:23:28,299 --> 00:23:35,589
that's it's winter configuration and

591
00:23:30,569 --> 00:23:38,589
then this you know some startling take

592
00:23:35,589 --> 00:23:39,759
down pictures they had a bucket lift and

593
00:23:38,589 --> 00:23:42,639
they were getting up but you can see

594
00:23:39,759 --> 00:23:44,890
even after two years the thing was had a

595
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:48,400
bit of integrity and would have lasted a

596
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:50,980
bit longer this was a piece and in

597
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:53,019
Denmark there are some sculpture parks

598
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:54,880
around the world where you have only you

599
00:23:53,019 --> 00:23:56,349
can only use natural materials most of

600
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:58,540
the time you can only get the materials

601
00:23:56,349 --> 00:24:00,490
from the park in order to work so it

602
00:23:58,539 --> 00:24:02,619
promoted a lot of sculptors trying their

603
00:24:00,490 --> 00:24:05,319
hand at working with natural materials

604
00:24:02,619 --> 00:24:07,029
in this case this is little big man he's

605
00:24:05,319 --> 00:24:09,759
seeking his own reflection in this

606
00:24:07,029 --> 00:24:13,210
little pond you can climb up in his body

607
00:24:09,759 --> 00:24:15,009
and look at his face and one of the

608
00:24:13,210 --> 00:24:17,289
great things about it was that it

609
00:24:15,009 --> 00:24:21,460
flooded half the year so it gave this

610
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:23,589
other kind of kind of epic kind of

611
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:26,130
feeling to this piece maybe some kind of

612
00:24:23,589 --> 00:24:30,099
a water sprite or something coming out

613
00:24:26,130 --> 00:24:32,830
my foot my father-in-law is from Norway

614
00:24:30,099 --> 00:24:36,609
so he was there and he took this picture

615
00:24:32,829 --> 00:24:38,329
of the of its final demise the hero has

616
00:24:36,609 --> 00:24:42,619
fallen

617
00:24:38,329 --> 00:24:46,048
this was at Frederik Meijer Gardens and

618
00:24:42,619 --> 00:24:49,709
and if you've never been there it's a

619
00:24:46,048 --> 00:24:53,190
great place for art and and plantings to

620
00:24:49,710 --> 00:24:55,980
go together this was my attempt at face

621
00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:59,640
jugs and there are three of them about

622
00:24:55,980 --> 00:25:01,529
22 feet high they sit along a window

623
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:03,270
wall so that you could see them all year

624
00:25:01,529 --> 00:25:07,920
you look at them they look back at you

625
00:25:03,269 --> 00:25:10,048
it's called juggernaut and so this was

626
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:12,480
for about three years later they had a

627
00:25:10,048 --> 00:25:14,700
four foot snow it came tearing down the

628
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:18,319
roof and knocked these pieces on their

629
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:22,519
butts and left him screaming in the snow

630
00:25:18,319 --> 00:25:24,720
and finally this piece was at the

631
00:25:22,519 --> 00:25:27,210
Botanic Garden in Clemson South Carolina

632
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:29,400
and it was the first time we used living

633
00:25:27,210 --> 00:25:31,410
plants within the wall so we planted

634
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:33,390
plants in there so that they could

635
00:25:31,410 --> 00:25:35,640
become a kind of talisman for what had

636
00:25:33,390 --> 00:25:38,400
been there this was at the five-year

637
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:41,700
mark as some of these maples we you know

638
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:44,700
botanic gardens can offer a continuous

639
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:46,798
watering they can also offer somebody to

640
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:49,470
go around in and kind of preen it and

641
00:25:46,798 --> 00:25:51,720
look at it all the time so they could do

642
00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:54,240
things that wouldn't normally take place

643
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:58,259
in a regular site this was a seven year

644
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:59,700
mark of the piece you know I want to

645
00:25:58,259 --> 00:26:02,160
talk about my work in terms of drawing

646
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:03,660
this is a kind of half permanent piece

647
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:05,730
that's in North Carolina at the North

648
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:09,900
Carolina Museum but everything you do

649
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:11,579
with a pencil you can do with a stick

650
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:14,429
line when you hit a piece of paper with

651
00:26:11,579 --> 00:26:15,619
it's a pencil you strike it with one

652
00:26:14,429 --> 00:26:18,630
weight and finish off with another

653
00:26:15,619 --> 00:26:21,029
leaving series of tapered lines since

654
00:26:18,630 --> 00:26:23,610
sticks are tapered they can ate those

655
00:26:21,029 --> 00:26:25,168
lines and give you the ability to make

656
00:26:23,609 --> 00:26:27,240
things that look like they're speeding

657
00:26:25,169 --> 00:26:29,220
along or that they have animation and

658
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:31,349
they they kind of give you the sense

659
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:34,860
that maybe this is some natural force of

660
00:26:31,349 --> 00:26:37,199
wind water or flow and it's all just

661
00:26:34,859 --> 00:26:40,798
kind of a drawing style of using Xing

662
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:43,830
and and just different weights color you

663
00:26:40,798 --> 00:26:46,069
can see how mass the color of some lines

664
00:26:43,829 --> 00:26:48,859
and the

665
00:26:46,069 --> 00:26:51,859
let the you know like Little Red Sticks

666
00:26:48,859 --> 00:26:58,879
fall to the back here i am making the

667
00:26:51,859 --> 00:27:01,699
thing this was at in sheboygan wisconsin

668
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:03,320
at there a Kohler Arts Center and I like

669
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:06,769
this piece as much as anything because

670
00:27:03,319 --> 00:27:08,720
it really explores drawing these pieces

671
00:27:06,769 --> 00:27:10,190
hang from the ceiling I've got big

672
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:11,990
sticks that are stuck in the super

673
00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:14,269
structure of the building that are about

674
00:27:11,990 --> 00:27:15,950
10 feet above the light track you can go

675
00:27:14,269 --> 00:27:20,599
over and move the pieces like this it's

676
00:27:15,950 --> 00:27:22,789
a red twig dogwood and willow and the

677
00:27:20,599 --> 00:27:24,319
thing is that we gather them in January

678
00:27:22,789 --> 00:27:26,750
and we brought them inside really quick

679
00:27:24,319 --> 00:27:28,789
so they held their color perfectly and

680
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:31,759
so we had these brilliant reds and

681
00:27:28,789 --> 00:27:33,529
greens that really dried out and really

682
00:27:31,759 --> 00:27:39,859
looked beautiful during their entire

683
00:27:33,529 --> 00:27:42,950
time there and kind of skywriting this

684
00:27:39,859 --> 00:27:45,769
is a from Denmark it's a piece on the

685
00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:47,720
North Sea and it was this simplicity

686
00:27:45,769 --> 00:27:49,160
plus i just went across the street

687
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:51,319
gathered the sticks brought them over

688
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:54,350
and worked them into this and to this

689
00:27:51,319 --> 00:27:55,909
series of poplar trees and you as an

690
00:27:54,349 --> 00:27:57,980
approach you drive down the road you

691
00:27:55,910 --> 00:28:00,140
take a really sharp left and you're

692
00:27:57,980 --> 00:28:03,680
looking at this right square in your in

693
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:05,860
your face so you know just uh you know

694
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:09,710
working with sticks allows for a lot of

695
00:28:05,859 --> 00:28:12,649
possibilities this was at the World

696
00:28:09,710 --> 00:28:15,380
Trade Center early on and you know

697
00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:18,440
adversity sometimes can perma be

698
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:19,970
promotive the Port Authority said you

699
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:21,559
can use sticks in the building as long

700
00:28:19,970 --> 00:28:23,900
as you don't touch the walls the floors

701
00:28:21,559 --> 00:28:26,269
of the ceiling and I saw these

702
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:27,980
electrician using ladders and so I went

703
00:28:26,269 --> 00:28:29,930
down to Putnam bladder company barred a

704
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:31,910
bunch of ladders brought them up there

705
00:28:29,930 --> 00:28:33,950
and one of the things about working on

706
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:36,560
site is the ability to adjust the scale

707
00:28:33,950 --> 00:28:38,450
so you can you know if you've under done

708
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:40,369
it you can build more go get more

709
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:42,860
ladders if you've overdone it takes some

710
00:28:40,369 --> 00:28:45,199
ladders away so a lot of times the

711
00:28:42,859 --> 00:28:47,559
success of a piece in a public space has

712
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:52,400
to do with the appropriateness of scale

713
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:54,919
so this is a kind of a second look

714
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:56,750
through the ladders this is that the

715
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:58,970
Phillips Collection this is three floors

716
00:28:56,750 --> 00:28:59,450
of sticks I'm actually out on the top of

717
00:28:58,970 --> 00:29:02,120
the building

718
00:28:59,450 --> 00:29:03,919
looking down through the oculus and you

719
00:29:02,119 --> 00:29:06,229
know like playing off these state these

720
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:09,620
smaller mark-making with this kind of

721
00:29:06,230 --> 00:29:11,899
large architectural line and so that's

722
00:29:09,619 --> 00:29:14,268
about 16 foot in the middle of that

723
00:29:11,898 --> 00:29:16,308
stick hole there and I had a platform

724
00:29:14,269 --> 00:29:18,349
lift and I was going up and down the

725
00:29:16,308 --> 00:29:20,329
three floors and putting and putting

726
00:29:18,349 --> 00:29:22,219
these sticks in and a lot of times I

727
00:29:20,329 --> 00:29:24,408
have to work with ongoing activities of

728
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:26,990
a space so I've learned to work without

729
00:29:24,409 --> 00:29:28,570
killing the audience and and you know it

730
00:29:26,990 --> 00:29:31,220
adds for a greater bit of conversation

731
00:29:28,569 --> 00:29:33,109
to have we have a spotter on the stairs

732
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:34,669
I'm working on the inside of the

733
00:29:33,109 --> 00:29:38,089
stairway people are talking to us the

734
00:29:34,669 --> 00:29:40,580
entire time so it's really fun what I do

735
00:29:38,089 --> 00:29:42,319
and allows for a lot of interaction with

736
00:29:40,579 --> 00:29:44,569
the public this was at the old American

737
00:29:42,319 --> 00:29:47,418
craft Museum in New York the same thing

738
00:29:44,569 --> 00:29:50,599
as trying to captivate this stairway try

739
00:29:47,419 --> 00:29:53,509
to activate it try to blend these kind

740
00:29:50,599 --> 00:29:56,778
of whirling lines with the lines that

741
00:29:53,509 --> 00:29:58,579
are evident in the architecture uh you

742
00:29:56,778 --> 00:30:01,369
know I wasn't just to talk a little bit

743
00:29:58,579 --> 00:30:05,388
about I use volunteers in my work at

744
00:30:01,369 --> 00:30:07,278
first it wasn't so much I was I would

745
00:30:05,388 --> 00:30:09,859
partner with organizations use their

746
00:30:07,278 --> 00:30:13,099
goodwill and in the community to

747
00:30:09,859 --> 00:30:14,479
organize the logistics at first they

748
00:30:13,099 --> 00:30:16,579
would say well we all get you some

749
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:18,409
people to help gather and then it turned

750
00:30:16,579 --> 00:30:20,599
out there were a lot of closet stick

751
00:30:18,409 --> 00:30:22,909
gathers around who said we want to help

752
00:30:20,599 --> 00:30:25,038
you why can't we help you work and so

753
00:30:22,909 --> 00:30:27,940
over a period of time I've gotten really

754
00:30:25,038 --> 00:30:30,169
good at letting people help me and

755
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:32,899
organizing the work in small bits and

756
00:30:30,169 --> 00:30:35,570
pieces so people can plug into it easily

757
00:30:32,898 --> 00:30:38,000
and really help me there's a plumber

758
00:30:35,569 --> 00:30:41,178
here there's a little electric a student

759
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:43,638
a retired engineer they all came out to

760
00:30:41,179 --> 00:30:45,710
help me on this piece we're working

761
00:30:43,638 --> 00:30:47,719
really high everybody's having a

762
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:49,278
fantastic time sometimes they said well

763
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:51,710
how do these people know what to do and

764
00:30:49,278 --> 00:30:53,148
I say well we've all been children and

765
00:30:51,710 --> 00:30:55,759
children know everything about sticks

766
00:30:53,148 --> 00:30:59,719
their weapon a tool a piece of a wall

767
00:30:55,759 --> 00:31:01,669
magic one musical instrument so you know

768
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:04,069
all you have to do is kind of reawaken

769
00:31:01,669 --> 00:31:07,759
those Inklings and adults and they're

770
00:31:04,069 --> 00:31:09,678
ready to go so we we always have a make

771
00:31:07,759 --> 00:31:12,079
a good go of it I'd had too many bottles

772
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:13,009
of Bordeaux and this was in France there

773
00:31:12,079 --> 00:31:15,139
was some wine drew

774
00:31:13,009 --> 00:31:17,750
making restaurants all around this park

775
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:22,100
so it gave me the inspiration of making

776
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:24,099
this gang of of bottles and here they

777
00:31:22,099 --> 00:31:30,949
are they pretty tall look pretty good

778
00:31:24,099 --> 00:31:33,559
and kind of a misty though this was at

779
00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:34,880
middlebury college and I wanted to show

780
00:31:33,559 --> 00:31:37,909
you this piece because I wanted to show

781
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:39,710
you how many people helped me and this

782
00:31:37,910 --> 00:31:41,630
piece had to be seen from the road it

783
00:31:39,710 --> 00:31:44,900
had to be able to stand up to six foot

784
00:31:41,630 --> 00:31:47,210
of snow and so you know lasted a really

785
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:49,490
long time and I was grateful all the

786
00:31:47,210 --> 00:31:51,769
folks that pitched in part of them

787
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:53,420
cleaned leaves part of a move scaffold

788
00:31:51,769 --> 00:31:58,670
and part of them helped me with the

789
00:31:53,420 --> 00:32:00,230
actual construction this is a day of me

790
00:31:58,670 --> 00:32:02,930
at being at the office people are

791
00:32:00,230 --> 00:32:05,690
constantly talking to me this was at the

792
00:32:02,930 --> 00:32:07,190
University of Michigan and you know

793
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:08,840
people stand around they tell you

794
00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:10,700
stories of their life they tell you

795
00:32:08,839 --> 00:32:14,059
stories about what they like and hate

796
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:15,920
about the arts you know there there's a

797
00:32:14,059 --> 00:32:18,019
kind of disbelief when you put a big

798
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:19,340
pile of sticks in the yard and they're

799
00:32:18,019 --> 00:32:21,109
calling the police and those are the

800
00:32:19,339 --> 00:32:23,769
same people they're inviting you for

801
00:32:21,109 --> 00:32:26,479
dinner the day you leave so that

802
00:32:23,769 --> 00:32:28,609
transition is as part and parcel of the

803
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:30,110
success of the work that you would see

804
00:32:28,609 --> 00:32:31,459
something that you really didn't

805
00:32:30,109 --> 00:32:34,039
couldn't believe is going to turn out

806
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:35,870
and then as the illusion bills and

807
00:32:34,039 --> 00:32:38,509
people are more friendly to it and

808
00:32:35,869 --> 00:32:41,709
finally really accepting and defending

809
00:32:38,509 --> 00:32:44,809
of it and sometimes there's impromptu

810
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:46,850
parties and when we pull this away this

811
00:32:44,809 --> 00:32:49,609
was in New Harmony we moved our

812
00:32:46,849 --> 00:32:51,409
scaffolding out to the street and people

813
00:32:49,609 --> 00:32:53,990
came running out of the barbershop with

814
00:32:51,410 --> 00:32:55,400
their faces half shaved they stop their

815
00:32:53,990 --> 00:32:58,190
cars bright in the middle of the road

816
00:32:55,400 --> 00:33:00,050
everybody came in this little place came

817
00:32:58,190 --> 00:33:02,720
over to see what what it really looked

818
00:33:00,049 --> 00:33:04,789
like they had a certain amount of fear

819
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:07,880
about approaching us we had five

820
00:33:04,789 --> 00:33:09,649
students helping from on the piece and

821
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:13,130
when we pull the things away everybody

822
00:33:09,650 --> 00:33:14,600
came for a look-see and of course this

823
00:33:13,130 --> 00:33:17,650
is an Ireland it's raining the whole

824
00:33:14,599 --> 00:33:21,109
time but this the students there are a

825
00:33:17,650 --> 00:33:22,910
very stalwart so no matter what you do

826
00:33:21,109 --> 00:33:25,669
people are going to come and see you in

827
00:33:22,910 --> 00:33:29,230
the rain a piece and had

828
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:31,519
morton arboretum in Chicago and

829
00:33:29,230 --> 00:33:35,180
constantly talking to people that are

830
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:36,980
are walking up to the site I wanted to

831
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:38,210
talk about my worth finally in three

832
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:40,670
ways because I've worked with

833
00:33:38,210 --> 00:33:42,200
architecture contrasting contemporary

834
00:33:40,670 --> 00:33:44,330
architecture with ancient ways of

835
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:46,960
working this was at the de Cordoba and

836
00:33:44,329 --> 00:33:50,269
Lincoln masked my idea about this was a

837
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:53,509
tower falling back to its origin as our

838
00:33:50,269 --> 00:33:54,859
serfs hut or perhaps a haystack and so

839
00:33:53,509 --> 00:33:57,109
of course you know they weren't that

840
00:33:54,859 --> 00:33:59,479
happy about me getting up on the roof I

841
00:33:57,109 --> 00:34:02,119
decided that I would build a mock-up of

842
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:03,799
the roof the roof is 70 feet up picked

843
00:34:02,119 --> 00:34:06,649
it up with a crane and set it on there

844
00:34:03,799 --> 00:34:08,690
like a dunce cap and then we had to get

845
00:34:06,650 --> 00:34:11,210
up there because the line quality didn't

846
00:34:08,690 --> 00:34:13,099
look that good I look too insignificant

847
00:34:11,210 --> 00:34:16,099
so I had to get up there and build the

848
00:34:13,099 --> 00:34:18,049
line quality up using this platform lift

849
00:34:16,099 --> 00:34:19,730
and so you always start out being safe

850
00:34:18,050 --> 00:34:22,039
on the platform lift and then you really

851
00:34:19,730 --> 00:34:24,050
need to work on something you say the

852
00:34:22,039 --> 00:34:26,119
guy we just hold my belt for a minute

853
00:34:24,050 --> 00:34:27,860
and you just crawl right out on the

854
00:34:26,119 --> 00:34:30,589
outside of it and get over there and and

855
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:34,309
do what you have to do and you can see

856
00:34:30,590 --> 00:34:36,650
we did make it a difference and this was

857
00:34:34,309 --> 00:34:39,619
in Florida at the Hollywood art culture

858
00:34:36,650 --> 00:34:43,610
center a kind of interaction between

859
00:34:39,619 --> 00:34:46,250
insect life in this building so I try to

860
00:34:43,610 --> 00:34:51,019
build sculptures that don't interfere

861
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:53,690
with ongoing activity this was a piece

862
00:34:51,019 --> 00:34:56,119
that I finished for max azria it's a

863
00:34:53,690 --> 00:34:58,610
clothing store on Melrose avenues in

864
00:34:56,119 --> 00:35:00,889
Hollywood and they were talking to me

865
00:34:58,610 --> 00:35:02,570
about doing something for the store and

866
00:35:00,889 --> 00:35:05,089
I thought well this is about cloth I'm

867
00:35:02,570 --> 00:35:08,450
going to make some Paisley cloth and so

868
00:35:05,090 --> 00:35:11,809
ended up covering this building pretty

869
00:35:08,449 --> 00:35:15,500
profoundly with all these flying bits of

870
00:35:11,809 --> 00:35:17,119
sticks and the second thing i've done is

871
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:19,519
i've worked with trees I've used trees

872
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:22,339
as a matrix on which to work this is in

873
00:35:19,519 --> 00:35:24,170
Japan this tree is 400 years old it was

874
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:27,019
planted the day this little temple was

875
00:35:24,170 --> 00:35:29,420
built in which I was staying and often

876
00:35:27,019 --> 00:35:31,099
times in Japan the sacred trees and

877
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:33,950
these Gardens have a little rice rope

878
00:35:31,099 --> 00:35:35,480
around them to signify them and so that

879
00:35:33,949 --> 00:35:38,179
gave me the idea of putting this kind of

880
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:40,429
welcoming cornucopia around this kind of

881
00:35:38,179 --> 00:35:43,980
ancient tree

882
00:35:40,429 --> 00:35:47,009
you can see it was pretty big I used the

883
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:48,869
Burj and all of the sticks and so forth

884
00:35:47,010 --> 00:35:51,390
on there and these bamboos to hold it up

885
00:35:48,869 --> 00:35:54,869
these kids came to visit me put them up

886
00:35:51,389 --> 00:35:57,960
in there this was a piece using lalanne

887
00:35:54,869 --> 00:36:00,179
dia and in England and these LAN LAN dia

888
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:02,369
hedges look solid but if you walk inside

889
00:36:00,179 --> 00:36:05,549
just inside there curtain you see this

890
00:36:02,369 --> 00:36:07,589
huge architectural beautiful cathedral

891
00:36:05,550 --> 00:36:09,390
like spaces in there and so I'm trying

892
00:36:07,590 --> 00:36:11,730
to feature those spaces by putting

893
00:36:09,389 --> 00:36:14,730
skylights in there and weaving these big

894
00:36:11,730 --> 00:36:17,280
chambers inside the bush so this is kind

895
00:36:14,730 --> 00:36:20,670
of how you get in the Warren and you go

896
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:24,360
in further and then you know have a good

897
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:28,829
time a piece that's in a tree was in a

898
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:32,039
tree and the universe and Birmingham

899
00:36:28,829 --> 00:36:33,539
Alabama at the Museum there and a lot of

900
00:36:32,039 --> 00:36:35,309
times if you put something in a tree

901
00:36:33,539 --> 00:36:37,529
unless you put something low down Nate

902
00:36:35,309 --> 00:36:39,690
people read up the tree they won't they

903
00:36:37,530 --> 00:36:41,970
won't look up so but if you go inside

904
00:36:39,690 --> 00:36:44,940
this building you see it's three floors

905
00:36:41,969 --> 00:36:48,029
up and it's quite an elaborate thing I

906
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:50,400
brought the tree limbs of trees nearby

907
00:36:48,030 --> 00:36:53,690
together and wove over them kind of

908
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:58,230
build this rollercoaster for squirrels

909
00:36:53,690 --> 00:37:00,389
and five also used the overtones of

910
00:36:58,230 --> 00:37:02,460
trees in other words not just the tree

911
00:37:00,389 --> 00:37:04,440
themselves but let the tree suggest and

912
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:06,840
have an interplay with the sculpture

913
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:10,380
this was down in Savannah and using this

914
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:12,750
live oak tree and the sense of mothering

915
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:15,119
by all of these bigger limbs above the

916
00:37:12,750 --> 00:37:17,849
small limbs and having all the moss and

917
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:21,869
stuff drop down on to this little

918
00:37:17,849 --> 00:37:24,449
architectural folly and then why this

919
00:37:21,869 --> 00:37:28,139
monkeypod tree one of my favorite trees

920
00:37:24,449 --> 00:37:31,379
it is just one leaf wide and using the

921
00:37:28,139 --> 00:37:33,809
trunk itself as a kind of a model for

922
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:36,900
how to make these pieces work underneath

923
00:37:33,809 --> 00:37:38,909
the tree and then they go up and work

924
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:44,070
themselves like bookends over the limbs

925
00:37:38,909 --> 00:37:46,319
and into you know sets and a piece in

926
00:37:44,070 --> 00:37:48,030
New Harmony Indiana you saw that when

927
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:51,630
people got excited and ran over there

928
00:37:48,030 --> 00:37:53,250
but this was its more formal view they

929
00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:55,349
it's a hornbeam hedge

930
00:37:53,250 --> 00:37:56,639
and so there was a lot of room up under

931
00:37:55,349 --> 00:37:59,069
the hedge it gave me the idea of

932
00:37:56,639 --> 00:38:01,230
building this kind of cliff dwelling up

933
00:37:59,070 --> 00:38:02,970
underneath the hedge and you can see how

934
00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:05,010
successful it is in the winter it has

935
00:38:02,969 --> 00:38:07,139
all this verticality then so you got

936
00:38:05,010 --> 00:38:09,780
really great contrast between winter and

937
00:38:07,139 --> 00:38:13,650
summer it's right in them on the commons

938
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:15,990
and this little town using a tree to

939
00:38:13,650 --> 00:38:17,910
help hold the heads up of these things

940
00:38:15,989 --> 00:38:20,879
called trailheads they've got their

941
00:38:17,909 --> 00:38:25,199
about 35 feet tall they were each head

942
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:27,240
uses one one tree to hold it up and a

943
00:38:25,199 --> 00:38:31,859
kind of elaborate shoulder system to go

944
00:38:27,239 --> 00:38:33,059
inside that's a when the third thing

945
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:35,280
that I've done sometimes there's no

946
00:38:33,059 --> 00:38:37,590
trees to work into there's no

947
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:39,150
architecture to glom onto you just have

948
00:38:37,590 --> 00:38:42,840
to make things that stand in a certain

949
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:45,869
place this was in Brittany I built a

950
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:48,570
kind of an earth saving turtle it's got

951
00:38:45,869 --> 00:38:50,159
the world on its back and a kind of

952
00:38:48,570 --> 00:38:52,680
elaborate thing but it had to stand

953
00:38:50,159 --> 00:38:54,929
there so i used the saplings that go in

954
00:38:52,679 --> 00:38:57,569
the ground to make a big stabilized

955
00:38:54,929 --> 00:38:59,279
situation in order to work and this was

956
00:38:57,570 --> 00:39:02,160
a place that i was working at it's a

957
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:04,200
kind of a place of an estate that the

958
00:39:02,159 --> 00:39:07,739
state owns and has turned into an art

959
00:39:04,199 --> 00:39:10,349
situation this was at the morris

960
00:39:07,739 --> 00:39:12,269
arboretum in philadelphia you know it

961
00:39:10,349 --> 00:39:15,029
started out as a snail shell from my

962
00:39:12,269 --> 00:39:17,610
garden and then it became a layer cake

963
00:39:15,030 --> 00:39:20,130
and then I said no it's a Japanese since

964
00:39:17,610 --> 00:39:23,519
14th century hairstyle finally I said no

965
00:39:20,130 --> 00:39:26,490
it's dr. Zhivago in the Summer Palace so

966
00:39:23,519 --> 00:39:29,280
I have lots of thoughts about things as

967
00:39:26,489 --> 00:39:33,089
I move and kind of organize my thoughts

968
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:35,670
as as I build something a piece that I

969
00:39:33,090 --> 00:39:38,960
made as a private Commission in North

970
00:39:35,670 --> 00:39:41,519
Carolina that has just come down I

971
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:47,849
called it hocus pocus they wanted to

972
00:39:41,519 --> 00:39:52,739
call it the thumbs up but anyway I

973
00:39:47,849 --> 00:39:54,619
wanted you to look inside and see they

974
00:39:52,739 --> 00:39:58,500
wanted to call it the petticoat palace

975
00:39:54,619 --> 00:39:59,909
so I couldn't deal with it but anyway

976
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:02,579
you can see that this is nothing but

977
00:39:59,909 --> 00:40:06,239
sticks there are no wires there is no

978
00:40:02,579 --> 00:40:06,598
string it's just a infernal power of the

979
00:40:06,239 --> 00:40:08,308
stick

980
00:40:06,599 --> 00:40:11,579
to tangle that's holding this big piece

981
00:40:08,309 --> 00:40:13,890
together a piece and Brussels sometimes

982
00:40:11,579 --> 00:40:15,390
I have to work inside I still have to

983
00:40:13,889 --> 00:40:18,118
make things that stand up they can't

984
00:40:15,389 --> 00:40:20,429
touch the walls or be supported that

985
00:40:18,119 --> 00:40:23,430
this is called sleepwalking and it's

986
00:40:20,429 --> 00:40:25,498
based on a kind of a tripod look kind of

987
00:40:23,429 --> 00:40:28,858
thing kind of elaborate but anyway it

988
00:40:25,498 --> 00:40:31,348
worked a piece at Purdue that's still up

989
00:40:28,858 --> 00:40:37,139
that maybe just has come down that was

990
00:40:31,349 --> 00:40:39,720
based on on the these serpent mounds

991
00:40:37,139 --> 00:40:42,449
that the first peoples in the Ohio

992
00:40:39,719 --> 00:40:43,919
Valley built and so this is looking at

993
00:40:42,449 --> 00:40:46,939
it from the top of the building it was

994
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:49,440
just such a great piece to experience a

995
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:51,509
piece at Bowdoin College I've learned to

996
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:55,650
hook things together at the waist to

997
00:40:51,509 --> 00:40:57,748
fight the potential of weather and deep

998
00:40:55,650 --> 00:40:59,068
snow to push something down in other

999
00:40:57,748 --> 00:41:02,488
words you have to make something that

1000
00:40:59,068 --> 00:41:05,038
can stand up under the conditions of the

1001
00:41:02,489 --> 00:41:07,528
place this piece is up in at Winthrop

1002
00:41:05,039 --> 00:41:10,410
right now in South Carolina Winthrop

1003
00:41:07,528 --> 00:41:13,278
University it's outside of a performing

1004
00:41:10,409 --> 00:41:16,170
arts center called ain't misbehaving at

1005
00:41:13,278 --> 00:41:19,829
five faces that look down different

1006
00:41:16,170 --> 00:41:23,119
streets look different ways up he said

1007
00:41:19,829 --> 00:41:25,650
was at the museum of glass and using a

1008
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:28,410
kind of imagery that might be made in

1009
00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:32,460
glass or clay and extending that image

1010
00:41:28,409 --> 00:41:33,808
using the reflection in the pond and I

1011
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:35,338
really wanted to show you how many

1012
00:41:33,809 --> 00:41:38,999
people would come to see a sculpture

1013
00:41:35,338 --> 00:41:40,818
burned and and that this is in Ireland

1014
00:41:38,998 --> 00:41:44,278
and Scotland you know they their

1015
00:41:40,818 --> 00:41:46,228
fire-prone their their druids and so

1016
00:41:44,278 --> 00:41:48,869
that they are being the whole county

1017
00:41:46,228 --> 00:41:50,218
came and they knew one Europe before

1018
00:41:48,869 --> 00:41:52,469
that they were going to set it on fire

1019
00:41:50,219 --> 00:41:55,920
and they had that that's the piece it

1020
00:41:52,469 --> 00:41:59,130
was a great piece it was made after the

1021
00:41:55,920 --> 00:42:01,769
calendar standing stones and this is you

1022
00:41:59,130 --> 00:42:03,719
can see the scale on these pieces they

1023
00:42:01,768 --> 00:42:06,258
were made from willow that was collected

1024
00:42:03,719 --> 00:42:10,200
from this farm that I was working on and

1025
00:42:06,259 --> 00:42:11,909
this was that fatal night this is the

1026
00:42:10,199 --> 00:42:14,460
next morning that's what a sculpture

1027
00:42:11,909 --> 00:42:17,190
looks like when it's gone vaporized and

1028
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:19,619
then these guys had the nerve to cook

1029
00:42:17,190 --> 00:42:31,050
their breakfast on my sculpture

1030
00:42:19,619 --> 00:42:33,909
thank you very much sat we have any time

1031
00:42:31,050 --> 00:42:37,289
so I rushed I rushed through that so

1032
00:42:33,909 --> 00:42:37,289
we'd have a few minutes for questions

1033
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:44,200
don't be shy hey listen we're working

1034
00:42:42,369 --> 00:42:46,210
down at the cyclist afternoon over at

1035
00:42:44,199 --> 00:42:51,429
the Children's Garden we're going to try

1036
00:42:46,210 --> 00:42:52,960
to pull off a workshop on Friday where

1037
00:42:51,429 --> 00:42:56,289
people can just come up and work on it

1038
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:58,420
and refine the set up a smaller thing a

1039
00:42:56,289 --> 00:43:00,699
little installation that people could

1040
00:42:58,420 --> 00:43:02,079
just come work on with us so we're going

1041
00:43:00,699 --> 00:43:03,969
to be there from two to four this

1042
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:08,860
afternoon and we're going to be there

we're going to work and then fighting

1045
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,750
all day and it's going to be able to

1046
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:16,410
children's guards so if you want to play

1047
00:43:13,750 --> 00:43:16,409
around with sticks

1048
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:30,669
well usually they bring a chipper

1049
00:43:28,989 --> 00:43:33,009
they'll bring a chipper at the end

1050
00:43:30,668 --> 00:43:34,389
they'll ship it on sometimes they try to

1051
00:43:33,009 --> 00:43:37,389
take it away in the night so that

1052
00:43:34,389 --> 00:43:38,768
there's nothing much controversy I was

1053
00:43:37,389 --> 00:43:41,918
trying to take that one foot the big

1054
00:43:38,768 --> 00:43:43,358
heads at the Museum down and we had an

1055
00:43:41,918 --> 00:43:45,188
insurrection the mud is from the

1056
00:43:43,358 --> 00:43:46,958
neighborhood around the sculpture park

1057
00:43:45,188 --> 00:43:50,558
came in a big group because we're going

1058
00:43:46,958 --> 00:43:52,088
to tell the artist on you have the

1059
00:43:50,559 --> 00:43:54,489
artist that they're making you take it

1060
00:43:52,088 --> 00:43:56,228
down and I'm really really sorry so you

1061
00:43:54,489 --> 00:43:57,639
know it's not what God made that some of

1062
00:43:56,228 --> 00:43:59,739
these things come down because you could

1063
00:43:57,639 --> 00:44:02,288
get very fond of them but they need to

1064
00:43:59,739 --> 00:44:04,509
come down while they still look and I

1065
00:44:02,289 --> 00:44:07,329
rarely get to go back and look at things

1066
00:44:04,509 --> 00:44:09,668
i do see follow-up pictures and it's

1067
00:44:07,329 --> 00:44:12,459
amazing how many pictures of a pc or on

1068
00:44:09,668 --> 00:44:15,188
the web so you can i can see what people

1069
00:44:12,458 --> 00:44:17,889
think of it just simply by going back on

1070
00:44:15,188 --> 00:44:20,949
him you know googling something i'll see

1071
00:44:17,889 --> 00:44:23,438
drafts of pictures about an individual

1072
00:44:20,949 --> 00:44:30,999
piece so nicely it's open up no they

1073
00:44:23,438 --> 00:44:33,998
shouldn't blinded yo you get one great

1074
00:44:30,998 --> 00:44:35,828
year in one pretty good year some places

1075
00:44:33,998 --> 00:44:37,568
like if you have a children's garden of

1076
00:44:35,829 --> 00:44:39,548
the one in Sausalito into the Brooklyn

1077
00:44:37,568 --> 00:44:41,708
the golden gate bridge there's a nice

1078
00:44:39,548 --> 00:44:44,168
children's museum there they kept one

1079
00:44:41,708 --> 00:44:47,168
for seven years and they just work on it

1080
00:44:44,168 --> 00:44:49,298
mess with it and renew it and it turned

1081
00:44:47,168 --> 00:44:51,548
out good pretty good please generally

1082
00:44:49,298 --> 00:44:54,068
stick scam facts that may just get

1083
00:44:51,548 --> 00:44:57,119
riddle they start talking are you to

1084
00:44:54,068 --> 00:45:00,699
have to use them you know what a lot of

1085
00:44:57,119 --> 00:45:03,219
other in play and you know I true a lot

1086
00:45:00,699 --> 00:45:05,528
of times I think it's better to have a

1087
00:45:03,219 --> 00:45:07,119
series of sculptures in a place so that

1088
00:45:05,528 --> 00:45:09,608
you could present a lot more ideas

1089
00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:12,510
because my theory is that sculptures

1090
00:45:09,608 --> 00:45:15,179
have ideas embedded in them and so once

1091
00:45:12,510 --> 00:45:17,160
general public has look come to

1092
00:45:15,179 --> 00:45:20,489
accommodate those ideas the sculpture

1093
00:45:17,159 --> 00:45:22,289
becomes lessons so having a raft or

1094
00:45:20,489 --> 00:45:24,689
number of sculptures one right after

1095
00:45:22,289 --> 00:45:26,219
another every show we're really allows

1096
00:45:24,690 --> 00:45:39,990
for a lot more thinking a more

1097
00:45:26,219 --> 00:45:42,599
provocative interplay with the public we

1098
00:45:39,989 --> 00:45:44,489
start out by pulling the shape with

1099
00:45:42,599 --> 00:45:46,469
wrote the name as we go we cut it off

1100
00:45:44,489 --> 00:45:49,049
and so it just holds itself together

1101
00:45:46,469 --> 00:45:51,480
there's no way during any no ropes or

1102
00:45:49,050 --> 00:45:54,210
anything annum it's better if it's

1103
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:56,280
thorough it has more kind of substance

1104
00:45:54,210 --> 00:45:58,409
of ability to make if we can build

1105
00:45:56,280 --> 00:46:00,990
something it's thoroughly sticks that

1106
00:45:58,409 --> 00:46:04,799
holds itself up that has in here another

1107
00:46:00,989 --> 00:46:06,809
to join me um there's some really good

1108
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:08,519
shots like pictures in in that slide

1109
00:46:06,809 --> 00:46:09,869
show did you take both of them or did

1110
00:46:08,519 --> 00:46:11,460
you just kind of collect them from like

1111
00:46:09,869 --> 00:46:13,859
the internet well I have an agreement

1112
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:16,349
with my sites and what I do is I ask the

1113
00:46:13,860 --> 00:46:19,340
sites to take the photos because they

1114
00:46:16,349 --> 00:46:22,739
need them to the photographer has their

1115
00:46:19,340 --> 00:46:25,530
copyright they sign the right for us to

1116
00:46:22,739 --> 00:46:28,139
use it anywhere you want so it's never

1117
00:46:25,530 --> 00:46:31,530
been just one desire it's been numerous

1118
00:46:28,139 --> 00:46:33,150
job person in a way I think that some

1119
00:46:31,530 --> 00:46:35,400
what is believed that they can take the

1120
00:46:33,150 --> 00:46:37,530
best shot with their work that no one

1121
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:39,300
else could see it like they do my theory

1122
00:46:37,530 --> 00:46:42,390
is that I don't use a camera every day

1123
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:44,160
so I'm not really thinking I have more

1124
00:46:42,389 --> 00:46:47,190
in my mind where I think

1125
00:46:44,159 --> 00:46:49,139
not really is so you know having

1126
00:46:47,190 --> 00:46:52,650
somebody that is realistic about what

1127
00:46:49,139 --> 00:46:55,078
they think they can get an image yes

1128
00:46:52,650 --> 00:46:57,059
it's turned out any more satisfactory

1129
00:46:55,079 --> 00:47:00,150
complete look at the cap they do a good

1130
00:46:57,059 --> 00:47:02,309
job of capturing the other piece but if

1131
00:47:00,150 --> 00:47:04,858
they did whether they can capture the

1132
00:47:02,309 --> 00:47:08,039
real essence of the case but truth is

1133
00:47:04,858 --> 00:47:10,230
letters only go so far and I think if

1134
00:47:08,039 --> 00:47:11,970
you if you see a photo of reason that

1135
00:47:10,230 --> 00:47:15,420
you would go and experience what you see

1136
00:47:11,969 --> 00:47:17,548
how lacking a photo is you know it just

1137
00:47:15,420 --> 00:47:20,639
documents something and allowed me a

1138
00:47:17,548 --> 00:47:23,940
different work unfortunately the only

1139
00:47:20,639 --> 00:47:27,929
way to get the sense of the pieces just

1140
00:47:23,940 --> 00:47:30,420
to go and experiences and to can have

1141
00:47:27,929 --> 00:47:32,639
the associations that you might that

1142
00:47:30,420 --> 00:47:34,079
might for me and I promoted you when

1143
00:47:32,639 --> 00:47:36,858
you're talking through it and thinking

1144
00:47:34,079 --> 00:47:40,890
about it and seeing how it really has a

1145
00:47:36,858 --> 00:47:44,058
reciprocity limits site in commerce with

1146
00:47:40,889 --> 00:47:44,058
full side of the scale

1147
00:47:52,119 --> 00:48:02,690
Moorthy building I started out with clay

1148
00:47:59,389 --> 00:48:05,690
and did my dissatisfaction was play is

1149
00:48:02,690 --> 00:48:07,010
that the further process it and I really

1150
00:48:05,690 --> 00:48:09,460
wanted it working large I was building

1151
00:48:07,010 --> 00:48:12,710
these really huge large today to play

1152
00:48:09,460 --> 00:48:15,170
tiredness is not working out but what

1153
00:48:12,710 --> 00:48:17,449
this is another kind of rebirth this is

1154
00:48:15,170 --> 00:48:22,309
a it's got the flexibility the

1155
00:48:17,449 --> 00:48:25,519
pliability of working with clay and you

1156
00:48:22,309 --> 00:48:28,250
know it's kind of fundamental and you

1157
00:48:25,519 --> 00:48:30,349
can be taken from the site just like

1158
00:48:28,250 --> 00:48:33,199
playing is often taken from the sky by

1159
00:48:30,349 --> 00:48:35,059
early people that use on this fire free

1160
00:48:33,199 --> 00:48:37,659
hearing the source of it it right over

1161
00:48:35,059 --> 00:48:40,039
there you know so I like that connection

1162
00:48:37,659 --> 00:48:42,199
with site and then I like the way that

1163
00:48:40,039 --> 00:48:44,539
you can mark plan can hit it mark it

1164
00:48:42,199 --> 00:48:46,460
easily when it's in its quest thing and

1165
00:48:44,539 --> 00:48:48,529
the same thing is that you know

1166
00:48:46,460 --> 00:48:50,510
translates to all these market is always

1167
00:48:48,530 --> 00:48:54,460
mark making but you're doing on the

1168
00:48:50,510 --> 00:48:54,460
surfaces of these of these big stick

1169
00:49:06,780 --> 00:49:10,570
well it's fast and furious at the

1170
00:49:09,250 --> 00:49:12,760
children's garden because it's really

1171
00:49:10,570 --> 00:49:14,440
not going to be a my work it's going to

1172
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:16,750
be a workshop in which other people get

1173
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:18,700
a chance to work we had to set out

1174
00:49:16,750 --> 00:49:20,739
something we wanted something that kids

1175
00:49:18,699 --> 00:49:23,129
could ultimately use and go through that

1176
00:49:20,739 --> 00:49:26,379
we've settled on us a grouping of five

1177
00:49:23,130 --> 00:49:30,250
kind of shapes that are interacting with

1178
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:31,900
columns to go between you and and we got

1179
00:49:30,250 --> 00:49:33,429
turns out there's a big bunch of

1180
00:49:31,900 --> 00:49:35,740
pumpkins that are sitting on the site

1181
00:49:33,429 --> 00:49:40,869
that will make absolutely great models

1182
00:49:35,739 --> 00:49:42,339
as people come to help us save those and

1183
00:49:40,869 --> 00:49:44,469
see what we can to example can bend

1184
00:49:42,340 --> 00:49:46,210
these shapes you know when you're first

1185
00:49:44,469 --> 00:49:48,099
starting them and people haven't really

1186
00:49:46,210 --> 00:49:49,690
worked with Styx ago you can't give them

1187
00:49:48,099 --> 00:49:51,610
too big of a test they have to have

1188
00:49:49,690 --> 00:49:55,450
simple shapes to work on so these are

1189
00:49:51,610 --> 00:49:57,280
very simple often shapes that rank that

1190
00:49:55,449 --> 00:49:59,079
we've derived because we as we're

1191
00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:01,410
on our site and looking really pretty

1192
00:49:59,079 --> 00:50:01,409
good

1193
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:07,940
or

1194
00:50:13,659 --> 00:50:17,679
so I think there needs to be a

1195
00:50:15,460 --> 00:50:19,929
consistent line logic between inside and

1196
00:50:17,679 --> 00:50:21,368
out and if we walk into a we realize

1197
00:50:19,929 --> 00:50:23,318
that you're kind of walking in and

1198
00:50:21,369 --> 00:50:25,930
carrying the lines are carrying you and

1199
00:50:23,318 --> 00:50:28,088
your finishing company and the inside so

1200
00:50:25,929 --> 00:50:30,969
there's a lot of consistency and when I

1201
00:50:28,088 --> 00:50:33,038
use volunteers a lot of their work on

1202
00:50:30,969 --> 00:50:36,009
the inside of these words just an

1203
00:50:33,039 --> 00:50:38,049
enormous amount of detail work to get it

1204
00:50:36,010 --> 00:50:39,670
because you've got to think cosmetics

1205
00:50:38,048 --> 00:50:42,338
you've got to think the same here is

1206
00:50:39,670 --> 00:50:44,818
because they can't jagged stick all over

1207
00:50:42,338 --> 00:50:48,519
the place evening and smooth beautiful

1208
00:50:44,818 --> 00:50:54,058
flowing interior as well so that the

1209
00:50:48,519 --> 00:50:58,690
people using these look nice actually

1210
00:50:54,059 --> 00:51:01,048
generating they do have a beautiful look

1211
00:50:58,690 --> 00:51:03,220
at their you know they did generation or

1212
00:51:01,048 --> 00:51:05,889
process would you just have to be

1213
00:51:03,219 --> 00:51:08,588
careful because in public you know the

1214
00:51:05,889 --> 00:51:10,750
public is not as forgiving as an

1215
00:51:08,588 --> 00:51:13,239
individual might be in seeing entropy

1216
00:51:10,750 --> 00:51:14,619
you know they might like yeah what was

1217
00:51:13,239 --> 00:51:17,849
that the first person see they have

1218
00:51:14,619 --> 00:51:21,420
giant pile of dirt sticks that was it

1219
00:51:17,849 --> 00:51:23,460
so I just I leave it up to my concerts

1220
00:51:21,420 --> 00:51:25,380
and they want those things to you know

1221
00:51:23,460 --> 00:51:29,940
to go to dust they can do a good date

1222
00:51:25,380 --> 00:51:36,800
which would feel like you can make you

1223
00:51:29,940 --> 00:51:36,800
no shame for having fun yet fell down

1224
