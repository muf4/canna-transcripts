1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:05,359
your mower blade needs to be sharp so

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:08,679
that you're getting a clean slice of the

3
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:12,559
leaf blade which then minimizes stress

4
00:00:08,679 --> 00:00:14,759
to the plant the plant uses less water

5
00:00:12,558 --> 00:00:17,278
but more importantly a dull blade

6
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:20,240
increases your fuel consumption 20 to

7
00:00:17,278 --> 00:00:23,039
30% so if you don't have access to a

8
00:00:20,239 --> 00:00:25,239
workbench a small table will work fine

9
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:26,840
and your basic seat clamp now when I'm

10
00:00:25,239 --> 00:00:29,278
sharpening the blade won't move around

11
00:00:26,839 --> 00:00:31,759
on me it'll make it a lot easier to keep

12
00:00:29,278 --> 00:00:33,359
the same Ed Edge one thing you want to

13
00:00:31,759 --> 00:00:36,119
check for when you're inspecting these

14
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:37,960
blades are large dings or major

15
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:40,839
scratching pitting on the front of the

16
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:43,759
blade another thing to look for when a

17
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:46,000
blade is pretty much on its last legs

18
00:00:43,759 --> 00:00:48,119
you'll have a crack starting to form

19
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,679
right here when that happens that means

20
00:00:48,119 --> 00:00:52,119
you have a compromised blade it's beyond

21
00:00:50,679 --> 00:00:54,640
the point of sharpening it you should

22
00:00:52,119 --> 00:00:56,718
replace it so nothing bad happens I like

23
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:59,558
to use two hands when I'm using a

24
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:01,039
file not to apply pressure you're not

25
00:00:59,558 --> 00:01:03,119
using a lot of pressure when you're

26
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:05,079
operating file you're just letting the

27
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:07,280
tool do its work you're just guiding it

28
00:01:05,079 --> 00:01:09,400
along you'll notice that I'm really not

29
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:12,519
pushing it's down at all other than to

30
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:12,520
keep it flat on the

31
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:19,560
blade this is a single-edged file

32
00:01:17,719 --> 00:01:21,920
meaning it only has grooves in One

33
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:25,400
Direction so you can only move in One

34
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,400
Direction which is always away from

35
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:30,359
you one thing you want to stay away from

36
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,879
is rolling your hand hands when you're

37
00:01:30,359 --> 00:01:33,799
running a file you're going to round the

38
00:01:31,879 --> 00:01:35,078
edge of this blade and that's not going

39
00:01:33,799 --> 00:01:36,280
to do you any good it's probably going

40
00:01:35,078 --> 00:01:39,879
to make it

41
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:42,118
worse so try to stay keep it

42
00:01:39,879 --> 00:01:44,319
flat if you have major dings in the

43
00:01:42,118 --> 00:01:46,560
blade on the front edge it may not be a

44
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:48,239
wasted blade you can still use it but

45
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,719
you are going to want to file that edge

46
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:52,798
down I like to wear a glove just in case

47
00:01:50,718 --> 00:01:55,078
I slide off when I'm filing that I don't

48
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:55,079
cut

49
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:01,159
myself you'll notice that I'm always

50
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:03,280
moving away from me

51
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:05,399
so this is a small balance it's under

52
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:07,680
$10 it's something you can find at your

53
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:10,038
Basic Hardware Store lawn and garden

54
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,599
stores so we have our mounting hole your

55
00:02:10,038 --> 00:02:14,238
Center screw that holds the blade in

56
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:16,159
place we also use this hole to set on

57
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:18,080
top of the balancer the balancer has

58
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:20,878
ridges on it to accommodate for multiple

59
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:23,080
sizes of main Center holes so we've

60
00:02:20,878 --> 00:02:24,719
actually lightened up this side we

61
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:27,680
haven't lightened up this side yet if

62
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:29,239
it's not balanced it's going to wobble

63
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,599
when it spins that's going to add to

64
00:02:29,239 --> 00:02:33,599
wear and tear to your blades it's also

65
00:02:31,598 --> 00:02:35,679
going to add to streaking and your

66
00:02:33,598 --> 00:02:37,919
cutting it's going to give you an uneven

67
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:40,120
cut when your blades aren't balanced

68
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:41,958
properly if the blade comes out of

69
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:43,959
balance where you take more metal off of

70
00:02:41,959 --> 00:02:46,360
one end than the other that can also

71
00:02:43,959 --> 00:02:48,080
affect fuel consumption and the quality

72
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:49,879
of cut you're going to get as well when

73
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:52,319
you're putting them back in you can

74
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:54,959
essentially tighten it up by hand almost

75
00:02:52,318 --> 00:02:57,280
90% of the

76
00:02:54,959 --> 00:03:01,400
way try not to overtighten it because

77
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,400
you got to get it off at some point
