1
00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:05,310
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,218 --> 00:00:06,599
University so today I'm going to be

3
00:00:05,309 --> 00:00:08,849
talking about a project that I've been

4
00:00:06,599 --> 00:00:11,160
working on for about the past year and a

5
00:00:08,849 --> 00:00:18,629
half I'm just in the middle of it still

6
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:20,640
so don't have any end conclusions but so

7
00:00:18,629 --> 00:00:23,189
first I'll start off by talking about

8
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:26,609
the project that I'm working under so

9
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:29,850
the pheno apps project is a group of

10
00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:31,500
computer programmers and plant

11
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:34,050
scientists we're working together

12
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:36,299
directly with breeders to develop apps

13
00:00:34,049 --> 00:00:39,299
smartphone apps for the phenotyping of

14
00:00:36,299 --> 00:00:41,280
plants these apps will then be deployed

15
00:00:39,299 --> 00:00:43,558
through breeder networks especially in

16
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,149
developing countries and one of the

17
00:00:43,558 --> 00:00:47,909
crops that the phenotypes project is

18
00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:49,950
especially interested in is cassava so

19
00:00:47,909 --> 00:00:52,529
we talked a lot about cassava in this

20
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:55,739
department but I thought I'd go over it

21
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:58,410
again cassava is both an industrial and

22
00:00:55,738 --> 00:01:00,448
a food crop and it's a staple for over

23
00:00:58,409 --> 00:01:03,058
800 million people especially in the

24
00:01:00,448 --> 00:01:06,658
tropics primary breeding targets of

25
00:01:03,058 --> 00:01:08,728
cassava are pest and disease resistance

26
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:10,649
yield and field performance and dry

27
00:01:08,728 --> 00:01:14,459
matter content today I'm going to be

28
00:01:10,649 --> 00:01:16,618
focusing mostly on dry matter cotton so

29
00:01:14,459 --> 00:01:18,899
because I have a root dry matter content

30
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:22,828
is the proportion or the percent of the

31
00:01:18,899 --> 00:01:28,709
root that is not water so after the

32
00:01:22,828 --> 00:01:31,708
water leaves the root it's so it's

33
00:01:28,709 --> 00:01:34,200
typically around 20 to 45 percent and up

34
00:01:31,709 --> 00:01:36,599
to 90 percent of that can be starch it

35
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:38,879
directly affects the dry yield of the

36
00:01:36,599 --> 00:01:42,689
cassava roots and also the food quality

37
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:45,899
or the mouthfeel which then it which

38
00:01:42,688 --> 00:01:50,188
then affects the consumer acceptance and

39
00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:53,248
the variety adoption rate of cassava and

40
00:01:50,188 --> 00:01:55,648
in talking to breeders I found over and

41
00:01:53,248 --> 00:01:58,519
over that this trait is notoriously

42
00:01:55,649 --> 00:02:02,218
difficult time consuming laborious to

43
00:01:58,519 --> 00:02:04,168
measure the two methods that are

44
00:02:02,218 --> 00:02:06,178
typically used are specific gravity and

45
00:02:04,168 --> 00:02:09,060
the oven method the specific gravity

46
00:02:06,179 --> 00:02:11,030
method here on Left involves weighing

47
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:12,710
the roots in air and water

48
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:14,479
and then plugging those values into an

49
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:17,240
equation to get the dry matter content

50
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:19,310
the oven method requires transport from

51
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:22,340
the field to a laboratory setting where

52
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:25,670
the samples are dried in an oven after

53
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:27,890
shredding and this requires consistent

54
00:02:25,669 --> 00:02:32,000
electricity which might not always be

55
00:02:27,889 --> 00:02:34,369
present in every given location and so

56
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,490
because of the challenges the time put

57
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:39,140
in and the labor put in different

58
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:42,680
breeding programs have been looking at a

59
00:02:39,139 --> 00:02:45,679
new technique to phenotype dry matter

60
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:49,099
content a little quicker and so this is

61
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:51,140
near-infrared spectroscopy or nears so

62
00:02:49,099 --> 00:02:53,659
it's been shown to be highly predictive

63
00:02:51,139 --> 00:02:56,179
of dry matter in cassava roots and this

64
00:02:53,659 --> 00:02:58,549
because of this it's being routinely

65
00:02:56,180 --> 00:03:00,860
used at sea at in Colombia for the

66
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:03,860
typing of dry matter cassava

67
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:05,060
but the validated spectrometers that

68
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:07,459
have been looked at so far are

69
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:09,920
prohibitively expensive for most small

70
00:03:07,459 --> 00:03:12,170
breeding programs to afford so because

71
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:13,939
of this we're looking into the use of a

72
00:03:12,169 --> 00:03:18,469
portable handheld spectrometer called

73
00:03:13,939 --> 00:03:22,849
the SIA which at $300 is a 150 to 200

74
00:03:18,469 --> 00:03:26,560
times price reduction from these other

75
00:03:22,849 --> 00:03:30,469
spectrometers cost so it does measure a

76
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:33,319
restricted amount of wavelengths in the

77
00:03:30,469 --> 00:03:37,129
near-infrared spectrum area of the

78
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:39,620
electromagnetic spectrum but as I'll

79
00:03:37,129 --> 00:03:41,500
talk about we've found this to also be

80
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:44,480
highly predictive of dry matter content

81
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:46,579
and then the spectrometer connects with

82
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:48,768
bluetooth to a smartphone app that can

83
00:03:46,579 --> 00:03:51,739
then be used by breeders and technicians

84
00:03:48,769 --> 00:03:53,629
in the field to collect data so now I'm

85
00:03:51,739 --> 00:03:56,230
gonna take a little step back and talk

86
00:03:53,629 --> 00:03:59,150
about what the infrared spectroscopy is

87
00:03:56,229 --> 00:04:02,209
so this is a method that allows for a

88
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:04,189
quick and non-destructive analyses it's

89
00:04:02,209 --> 00:04:08,000
been used in lots of different fields

90
00:04:04,189 --> 00:04:09,979
including you can tell medications apart

91
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,340
like counterfeit or not counterfeit and

92
00:04:09,979 --> 00:04:15,349
then in agriculture specifically it's

93
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:17,530
been used for cultivar identification

94
00:04:15,349 --> 00:04:21,199
for measuring bricks and other traits

95
00:04:17,529 --> 00:04:23,589
and what it is is the spectrometer

96
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:24,709
measures the reflectance of light in

97
00:04:23,589 --> 00:04:25,899
near

98
00:04:24,709 --> 00:04:30,849
for red region of the electromagnetic

99
00:04:25,899 --> 00:04:33,318
spectrum which goes from about 700 and

100
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:36,410
the reflectance in this region

101
00:04:33,319 --> 00:04:37,879
represents a complex signal from the

102
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:39,410
physical and chemical properties of

103
00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:42,889
whatever is being scanned

104
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:44,750
so because the signal is complex

105
00:04:42,889 --> 00:04:46,819
it requires multivariate statistical

106
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:49,819
techniques to be able to decipher what's

107
00:04:46,819 --> 00:04:52,189
going on and then it also requires the

108
00:04:49,819 --> 00:04:55,490
development of calibration models for

109
00:04:52,189 --> 00:04:58,219
use in each and every application so

110
00:04:55,490 --> 00:05:00,530
this cultivar identification in beans

111
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:04,460
will require a different model from

112
00:05:00,529 --> 00:05:06,978
measuring bricks and apples and so in my

113
00:05:04,459 --> 00:05:09,739
case this looks like three main steps

114
00:05:06,978 --> 00:05:12,379
first the calibration data is collected

115
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:15,288
and then that data is fed as training

116
00:05:12,379 --> 00:05:17,089
data into a prediction model development

117
00:05:15,288 --> 00:05:19,038
pipeline and once those models are

118
00:05:17,089 --> 00:05:22,339
developed they can be used for routine

119
00:05:19,038 --> 00:05:26,598
analysis in breeding programs so this

120
00:05:22,339 --> 00:05:30,228
requires protocol optimization to decide

121
00:05:26,598 --> 00:05:32,750
what different steps need to be put into

122
00:05:30,228 --> 00:05:35,689
the data collection protocol and also

123
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:38,089
into the model development pipeline and

124
00:05:35,689 --> 00:05:41,449
then once the models are developed they

125
00:05:38,089 --> 00:05:43,668
will also require consistent updating as

126
00:05:41,449 --> 00:05:46,728
the phenotype change as environments

127
00:05:43,668 --> 00:05:49,519
change so I'm gonna zoom in and talk

128
00:05:46,728 --> 00:05:53,658
about my work in steps one two and the

129
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:54,978
protocol optimization so I have two

130
00:05:53,658 --> 00:05:57,408
different breeding programs that I'm

131
00:05:54,978 --> 00:05:59,990
working with ITA in Nigeria and not gree

132
00:05:57,408 --> 00:06:02,389
in Uganda each with two different years

133
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:05,478
of data so far I just have this first

134
00:06:02,389 --> 00:06:07,939
year collected my now sees for the rest

135
00:06:05,478 --> 00:06:12,649
of the presentation will focus on these

136
00:06:07,939 --> 00:06:16,129
trials in Nigeria which include 129

137
00:06:12,649 --> 00:06:18,978
genotypes total with two reps each these

138
00:06:16,129 --> 00:06:21,168
data were collected with six routes per

139
00:06:18,978 --> 00:06:23,500
plot the roots were sliced in half

140
00:06:21,168 --> 00:06:26,120
crossways and then scanned

141
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:27,918
cross-sectionally these are more slices

142
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:31,189
than were actually taken it was just cut

143
00:06:27,918 --> 00:06:33,918
in half scan like this and then the

144
00:06:31,189 --> 00:06:36,860
those same routes were put in through

145
00:06:33,918 --> 00:06:38,479
the standard operating protocol for the

146
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:40,879
oven method to determine

147
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:42,950
content and this was done for each

148
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:45,290
individual route so for each route I

149
00:06:42,949 --> 00:06:49,789
have a pairing of scans and a dry matter

150
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:52,310
content value from the oven method these

151
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:54,319
were then fed into pre-processing

152
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:56,810
techniques and then into my model

153
00:06:54,319 --> 00:07:00,589
development pipeline which consisted of

154
00:06:56,810 --> 00:07:03,110
50 iterations of random split of 70%

155
00:07:00,589 --> 00:07:05,449
training and 30% validation to get a

156
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:08,270
better idea of what different training

157
00:07:05,449 --> 00:07:10,310
sets well what the effect of different

158
00:07:08,269 --> 00:07:13,120
training sets will have on the

159
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:15,949
predictive ability of the models and so

160
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:19,220
then I looked specifically at the

161
00:07:15,949 --> 00:07:23,000
different pre-processing techniques and

162
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:25,040
their effect on the models themselves so

163
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,170
I looked at 12 different techniques

164
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:29,360
including scattered correction and

165
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:34,340
derivatives and compared them with the

166
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:36,889
raw data values so this graph shows from

167
00:07:34,339 --> 00:07:38,810
left to right on the x-axis different

168
00:07:36,889 --> 00:07:41,539
pre-processing techniques with raw data

169
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:43,399
on the far left the top is predictive

170
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:45,260
ability of the model with our squared

171
00:07:43,399 --> 00:07:47,629
prediction in the bottom is root mean

172
00:07:45,259 --> 00:07:49,759
squared error of prediction and as you

173
00:07:47,629 --> 00:07:51,199
can see there's no statistically

174
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:54,439
significant difference between the

175
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:57,560
different pre-processing methods and the

176
00:07:54,439 --> 00:07:59,120
raw data itself so I will use this to

177
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:01,069
inform my model development pipeline

178
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:05,000
moving forward but I'll keep checking it

179
00:08:01,069 --> 00:08:07,790
with different data sets as the data

180
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:10,370
itself might require different

181
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:14,150
pre-processing methods so one other

182
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:16,490
thing that I looked at in the protocol

183
00:08:14,149 --> 00:08:18,289
optimization is the number of routes

184
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:20,300
that I included for plot so if you

185
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:22,550
remember I had the dry matter content

186
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:25,730
for each individual route and I used

187
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:27,949
that in this analysis so from left to

188
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:30,140
right we have 1 through 6 routes per

189
00:08:27,949 --> 00:08:32,059
plot and then this is the r-squared

190
00:08:30,139 --> 00:08:35,539
prediction again and the root mean

191
00:08:32,059 --> 00:08:38,239
squared error of prediction and there

192
00:08:35,539 --> 00:08:40,069
are clear advantages to adding more

193
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:42,830
routes but there seem to be diminishing

194
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:45,830
returns after about three routes and

195
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:48,139
then this again will be used to inform

196
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:50,930
the future calibration data collection

197
00:08:48,139 --> 00:08:52,199
and the SOPs that we develop for

198
00:08:50,929 --> 00:08:55,799
breeding programs to

199
00:08:52,200 --> 00:09:00,720
and their routine phenotyping of dry

200
00:08:55,799 --> 00:09:04,139
matter contents and so with this our our

201
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:06,149
final goal is that routine use of this

202
00:09:04,139 --> 00:09:08,549
method in breeding programs but to get

203
00:09:06,149 --> 00:09:10,409
there we have Additional Protocol

204
00:09:08,549 --> 00:09:14,458
optimization that I'd like to perform

205
00:09:10,409 --> 00:09:16,469
and then additional data from the other

206
00:09:14,458 --> 00:09:20,189
breeding program in Uganda as well as

207
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:21,930
from 2019 and then I'd like to evaluate

208
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:25,170
prediction models across environments

209
00:09:21,929 --> 00:09:27,539
and breeding programs and then finally

210
00:09:25,169 --> 00:09:30,059
integrate this data type and the models

211
00:09:27,539 --> 00:09:37,439
that I create into cassava base so that

212
00:09:30,059 --> 00:09:39,869
breeders can access I'd like to thank my

213
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:42,660
lab and my great collaborators from the

214
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:53,970
next-gen cassava project if you know

215
00:09:42,659 --> 00:10:00,208
Epstein are there any questions for

216
00:09:53,970 --> 00:10:03,028
Jenna Joan is how repeatable are these

217
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:06,419
did you try measuring the same roots two

218
00:10:03,028 --> 00:10:09,600
or three or four times so I scanned each

219
00:10:06,419 --> 00:10:12,269
root six times and so far have been

220
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:16,230
averaging the scans across the root but

221
00:10:12,269 --> 00:10:18,828
I do want to look at the number of scans

222
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:21,209
per sample to see if that's affecting

223
00:10:18,828 --> 00:10:24,088
the results that I'm getting so looking

224
00:10:21,208 --> 00:10:26,219
at once can per root and comparing it

225
00:10:24,089 --> 00:10:29,459
with another scan for the root or

226
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:33,540
averaging two or three to see how many

227
00:10:29,458 --> 00:10:36,679
we should be so it's not something I've

228
00:10:33,539 --> 00:10:36,679
looked at yet but I do

229
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:09,920
so the question is whether we're exactly

230
00:11:08,028 --> 00:11:12,708
on the route the scans are taking place

231
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:20,838
and how that affects and the results

232
00:11:12,708 --> 00:11:23,388
that so I've been we're taking the route

233
00:11:20,839 --> 00:11:25,939
and cutting it in half crossways in the

234
00:11:23,389 --> 00:11:30,709
middle and then taking three scans on

235
00:11:25,938 --> 00:11:33,078
each half both on the cut surface so we

236
00:11:30,708 --> 00:11:34,818
have not so far looked at different

237
00:11:33,078 --> 00:11:37,370
regions of the route so we do know that

238
00:11:34,818 --> 00:11:39,458
dry matter can vary from the proximal to

239
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:41,688
distal end of the route and that is

240
00:11:39,458 --> 00:11:44,869
something else that we want to look at

241
00:11:41,688 --> 00:11:46,958
so we do have a collaborator at Umbra in

242
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:49,278
Brazil who's looking at this right now

243
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:51,828
and I've been talking to him about

244
00:11:49,278 --> 00:11:54,289
getting that data and looking at it but

245
00:11:51,828 --> 00:11:57,979
so far the roots have all been the same

246
00:11:54,289 --> 00:12:07,730
age roughly the same size and so that

247
00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:10,850
also is not what is the relationship

248
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:16,699
between dry matter and consumer

249
00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:19,909
acceptance so all that I know about that

250
00:12:16,698 --> 00:12:23,419
is secondhand from readers and from

251
00:12:19,909 --> 00:12:25,789
people who saw a few of them but they

252
00:12:23,419 --> 00:12:27,769
all say that the higher dry matter is

253
00:12:25,789 --> 00:12:32,299
better it just feels better in your

254
00:12:27,769 --> 00:12:36,110
mouth it cooks better and so I think

255
00:12:32,299 --> 00:12:38,508
that consumers can can tell whether a

256
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:40,970
route is higher low dry matter when

257
00:12:38,509 --> 00:12:43,100
they're eating it and then it might mean

258
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:44,810
that they don't buy cassava from that

259
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:46,879
person who sold the low dry matter

260
00:12:44,809 --> 00:12:50,958
cassava to them or something like that

261
00:12:46,879 --> 00:12:54,110
but I haven't done any direct consumer

262
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:55,479
studies or anything like that any other

263
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:57,919
questions

264
00:12:55,480 --> 00:13:00,490
all right on let's give Jenna another

265
00:12:57,919 --> 00:13:00,490
round of applause
