1
00:00:02,359 --> 00:00:06,000
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:08,279 --> 00:00:13,919
University thank you Jason for the intro

3
00:00:11,638 --> 00:00:16,000
um indeed I'm the adviser of uh of

4
00:00:13,919 --> 00:00:18,320
Judith who if you've seen her talk works

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,278
on um

6
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,960
meteorology um so to say the environment

7
00:00:21,278 --> 00:00:24,599
that the plants are exposed to this is

8
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:27,199
also my background I'm actually trained

9
00:00:24,599 --> 00:00:29,599
as a hydrologist work a lot across

10
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:31,320
disciplines with meteorology but like I

11
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:33,558
always say we have a special fness for

12
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:35,280
plants and uh this is sort of how I

13
00:00:33,558 --> 00:00:37,199
ended up working on

14
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,120
photosynthesis uh in a very cool

15
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:42,160
environment or very hot environment I

16
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:45,519
should say uh Yellowstone National Park

17
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:47,959
um so I'll just tell you briefly how as

18
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:51,399
a hydrologist I ended up studying

19
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:54,799
photosynthesis um and this all uh came

20
00:00:51,399 --> 00:00:58,198
through lyans and lyans is a very

21
00:00:54,799 --> 00:01:01,358
interesting species right they

22
00:00:58,198 --> 00:01:03,439
symbiosis uh between fungus and an alga

23
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:05,920
or a cyano bacteria and what is really

24
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:08,118
cool about lyans is that they can dry

25
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:10,519
out completely and then as soon as you

26
00:01:08,118 --> 00:01:12,680
hydrate them they they restart

27
00:01:10,519 --> 00:01:15,199
photosynth photosynthesis almost

28
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:17,520
instantly so um I was actually doing

29
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,200
this uh sabatical a couple of years ago

30
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:21,798
with a hydrology group and then there

31
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,159
was a group that uh invited me and said

32
00:01:21,799 --> 00:01:24,880
hey would you like to come and have a

33
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:26,640
look at our work on lyans because they

34
00:01:24,879 --> 00:01:30,039
have this very cool behavior in relation

35
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:34,079
to water so I ended up studying uh the

36
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:36,360
water transport in lyans with them and

37
00:01:34,078 --> 00:01:39,559
another thing we did is that we started

38
00:01:36,359 --> 00:01:42,239
looking at oxygen Evolution from

39
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:44,439
photosynthesis um sort of playing around

40
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:47,718
and then what we find out found out is

41
00:01:44,438 --> 00:01:50,319
when we uh ex um expose the Lykan to

42
00:01:47,718 --> 00:01:53,919
light then dark then light then dark we

43
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:57,199
saw this oxygen Evolution uh accelerate

44
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:58,920
with subsequent light exposures so we

45
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:03,520
thought you know what what could be

46
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:06,039
happening there is that of course the um

47
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:08,199
the alga produces oxygen which is

48
00:02:06,039 --> 00:02:11,199
beneficial for the fungus but then the

49
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:13,318
fungus respires produces CO2 that is

50
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:15,679
then beneficial for photosynthesis by

51
00:02:13,318 --> 00:02:16,919
the alga uh so we were able to prove

52
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,319
that that actually was part of the

53
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:21,839
symbiosis in addition to the known

54
00:02:19,318 --> 00:02:23,679
symbiosis of water exchange and su Sugar

55
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:26,800
exchange between the fungus and the and

56
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:28,120
the alga uh so that is and not so

57
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:31,719
surprising either right because this is

58
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:33,599
a confocal micro micr croscopy image

59
00:02:31,719 --> 00:02:35,199
that I took while at rgar University

60
00:02:33,598 --> 00:02:37,280
that was hosting me for this for This

61
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:38,878
research uh and you can see they're

62
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,158
right in each other's space right so it

63
00:02:38,878 --> 00:02:44,359
makes sense that they're exposed to each

64
00:02:40,158 --> 00:02:47,239
other's gas uh emissions so to speak um

65
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:49,640
so this led us to to be uh yeah to

66
00:02:47,239 --> 00:02:52,200
become curious about this the role of

67
00:02:49,639 --> 00:02:54,518
CO2 uh in photosynthesis because the

68
00:02:52,199 --> 00:02:57,000
group I was visiting Charles dis mucus

69
00:02:54,519 --> 00:02:59,239
Lab at uh at rgar University they had

70
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,598
mostly focused on the light reactions

71
00:02:59,239 --> 00:03:02,560
around photo system too if you're

72
00:03:00,598 --> 00:03:05,039
familiar with photosynthesis so this is

73
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:09,239
where water is oxidized is split into

74
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:11,679
oxygen and and hydrogen protons um but

75
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:13,799
then we said so you know now that we saw

76
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:16,040
this effect of CO2 on photosynthesis it

77
00:03:13,799 --> 00:03:18,640
is sort of known right that with higher

78
00:03:16,039 --> 00:03:20,359
CO2 there is this fertilization effect

79
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:22,399
where the gross primary production is

80
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:24,200
increasing we also know from Green

81
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,000
houses that I'm sure you're much more

82
00:03:24,199 --> 00:03:29,238
familiar with than me is that when they

83
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,799
enrich in CO2 up to about a th000 PPM

84
00:03:29,239 --> 00:03:34,158
this really benefits growth right it

85
00:03:31,799 --> 00:03:37,400
improves the the fruit

86
00:03:34,158 --> 00:03:40,318
quality um and then uh yeah this is

87
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:42,640
explained by the fact that uh higher CO2

88
00:03:40,318 --> 00:03:44,359
levels uh enhance the saturation level

89
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:46,559
of the rubisco enzyme that plays an

90
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:49,480
important role right in carbox so the

91
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,680
CO2 uptake and then conversion to sugars

92
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:52,158
uh and then but there's also a couple of

93
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:54,280
other interactions that are not so well

94
00:03:52,158 --> 00:03:56,438
understood so it's not straightforward

95
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:59,400
as in you know more CO2 more more

96
00:03:56,438 --> 00:04:02,680
primary production um and then just a

97
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:04,840
bit of background of of of why CO2 is so

98
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:07,400
important for photosynthesis right so

99
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:09,519
here is this this is a chloroplast and

100
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:11,239
then here is rubisco this enzyme that

101
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:14,759
fixes

102
00:04:11,239 --> 00:04:17,680
CO2 um and then uh yeah through the

103
00:04:14,759 --> 00:04:20,959
celvin cycle so a series of reactions it

104
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:24,040
fixes CO2 um converts it to a couple of

105
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:26,439
com intermediate compounds eventually uh

106
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:29,240
goes out as sugars and then there is

107
00:04:26,439 --> 00:04:31,399
this R rulos bis phosphate that needs to

108
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:34,600
be Regen generated in order to take up

109
00:04:31,399 --> 00:04:37,120
the next CO2 but now what Risco this

110
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:40,240
enzyme also does it can react with

111
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:42,439
oxygen the oxygenation reaction and that

112
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:45,240
is actually not beneficial for the plant

113
00:04:42,439 --> 00:04:48,079
it costs energy it produces CO2 rather

114
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:51,000
than fixing CO2 it produces compounds

115
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:53,879
that the plant needs to get rid of so so

116
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,478
what you want is more carboxilate and

117
00:04:53,879 --> 00:04:58,360
less oxygenation so you can imagine that

118
00:04:56,478 --> 00:05:01,038
by increasing the CO2 level it is just

119
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:02,680
more likely to pick up a CO2 rather than

120
00:05:01,038 --> 00:05:04,879
oxygen right so that's a bit of the

121
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:06,478
background and then uh the other thing

122
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:09,038
that I'll be coming back to is that in

123
00:05:06,478 --> 00:05:11,599
this series of reactions the the Kelvin

124
00:05:09,038 --> 00:05:14,560
cycle needs ATP and

125
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:16,000
nadph um to to run the celvin cycle in

126
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,759
in these reactions and these are

127
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,279
produced by What's called the light uh

128
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:22,280
reactions in the thid membrane so they

129
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:25,279
capture the light energy that can be

130
00:05:22,279 --> 00:05:27,519
used to produce these ATP and nadph so

131
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:30,719
they're very connected and that'll be

132
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:33,599
important as as we'll see later

133
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:35,319
um all right so then so that there's a

134
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,479
benefit right of having higher CO2

135
00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:40,720
levels but on the other hand very high

136
00:05:37,478 --> 00:05:42,038
CO2 can also lead to acidification of

137
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,800
the cell

138
00:05:42,038 --> 00:05:47,719
environment um because CO2 it's a tiny

139
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,600
molecule right so it can easily permeate

140
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:51,240
through

141
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:55,280
membranes um it hydrolyzes and then it

142
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:58,199
forms acids the leis acids that are just

143
00:05:55,279 --> 00:06:00,239
the hydrolyzed CO2 and then the bronet

144
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:03,080
acid so they actually release prot into

145
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:06,400
the environment and then what that does

146
00:06:03,079 --> 00:06:09,079
is that it reduces pH gradients and

147
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:11,159
these pH gradients across the membrane

148
00:06:09,079 --> 00:06:13,560
are needed to produce

149
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:15,680
ATP so you can imagine that when the

150
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:17,720
cell environment becomes very acidic it

151
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:19,439
becomes harder and harder to build up a

152
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:21,199
gradient across the membrane because

153
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:23,519
there's already so much acid in the

154
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:26,919
environment so that makes it much harder

155
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:29,719
to to produce ATP so there a very high

156
00:06:26,918 --> 00:06:32,519
CO2 level can actually become harmful

157
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:35,199
plus it can carate proteins so it can

158
00:06:32,519 --> 00:06:37,959
cause further damage so we were

159
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:40,319
wondering so if we have elevated CO2 how

160
00:06:37,959 --> 00:06:42,638
does photosynthesis adapt right how does

161
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:45,199
it make sure to benefit take the maximum

162
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:48,360
benefit from higher CO2 versus yeah

163
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:50,400
avoid this acidification uh effects and

164
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:51,800
we wanted to look at extreme CO2

165
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:53,879
environments most of the research has

166
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:57,680
been done on sort of mild CO2

167
00:06:53,879 --> 00:06:59,959
enrichments up to the Thousand PPM level

168
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:01,879
um but we wanted to see what we go

169
00:06:59,959 --> 00:07:04,198
beyond right where is is there somewhere

170
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:07,560
a threshold where it flipped from being

171
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:09,038
beneficial to being very harmful so this

172
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:10,959
is how we started looking for an

173
00:07:09,038 --> 00:07:13,240
environment where we could find this out

174
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:14,478
in the field because you can imagine

175
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:16,519
that doing this I mean in the growth

176
00:07:14,478 --> 00:07:18,598
chamber is that very representative for

177
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:19,799
the real reality doing it in the fields

178
00:07:18,598 --> 00:07:22,959
this is being done they're called the

179
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:25,439
face experiments faac but they to they

180
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:27,519
find out it's it's hard right to I mean

181
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:29,120
you blow extra CO2 into the field but to

182
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:30,279
get that well distributed and everything

183
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:33,240
so we want wanted to look for a place

184
00:07:30,279 --> 00:07:36,359
where this is just happening uh

185
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:38,280
naturally and then uh yeah a sort of a

186
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:41,080
natural laboratory where this happens

187
00:07:38,279 --> 00:07:42,399
naturally is Yellowstone National Park

188
00:07:41,079 --> 00:07:44,240
you're probably familiar with it right

189
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:46,399
it's a it's a volcanic area with a lot

190
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:49,079
of geothermal sources there's geysers

191
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:50,799
there's hot pots there's uh and and a

192
00:07:49,079 --> 00:07:54,198
lot and some several of those are

193
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:56,560
emitting very high levels of uh gas

194
00:07:54,199 --> 00:07:59,478
C2 and have been doing so for many

195
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:02,000
centuries based on the geological uh re

196
00:07:59,478 --> 00:08:04,120
research history that is likely and

197
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,720
based on records from the USGS we know

198
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:09,120
that at least uh for the last say since

199
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:11,280
the 1980s or so they have records or

200
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:14,038
they have recorded these CO2 levels so

201
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:16,359
we have a very pretty good idea of of

202
00:08:14,038 --> 00:08:18,519
also the history of CO2 emissions uh

203
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:22,000
around these geothermal

204
00:08:18,519 --> 00:08:24,079
sources um so we went in 2019 and we

205
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,120
went to scope out sites across the

206
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:28,719
Yellowstone National Park that had be

207
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:30,199
reported by USGS as having very high CO2

208
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:32,000
emissions

209
00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:36,000
uh and very high we're talking up to

210
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:38,200
about 6,000 PPN or even Beyond in some

211
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,479
places um but of course we wanted to

212
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:42,599
study photosynthesis so we also need

213
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:44,639
places where we find plants right where

214
00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:47,278
we find life or lyans we also look for

215
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:49,240
lyans but we didn't find those it's too

216
00:08:47,278 --> 00:08:50,759
harsh an environment for for the lyans

217
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:52,600
apparently they don't like an acid

218
00:08:50,759 --> 00:08:54,200
environment so but we did find

219
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:56,959
vegetation around some of these sources

220
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:58,560
as you can see uh so so that was

221
00:08:56,958 --> 00:09:00,599
successful in in in that sense that we

222
00:08:58,559 --> 00:09:04,000
could really find a couple couple of uh

223
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:07,200
geothermal sites or CO2 emission sites I

224
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:10,360
should say with ve vegetation close by

225
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:13,680
but then um yeah we found these two

226
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:17,440
sites to be the most uh yeah stable in

227
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:21,359
CO2 emission extreme CO2 emission this

228
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:23,440
6,000 PPM elevation more or less um and

229
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:25,600
then also vegetation growing very close

230
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:27,040
to the sources so we could be pretty

231
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,839
sure that they are really exposed to

232
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:32,838
that very high CO2 level

233
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:35,600
uh they're both um um yeah calcium

234
00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:38,079
deposits calcium carbonate deposits and

235
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:40,839
that is what uh causes these very high

236
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:42,078
CO2 levels as the as the gases move

237
00:09:40,839 --> 00:09:43,560
through the soil you can imagine that

238
00:09:42,078 --> 00:09:45,679
that takes up all the CO2 and then emits

239
00:09:43,559 --> 00:09:47,599
it into the atmosphere now the other

240
00:09:45,679 --> 00:09:50,239
thing we needed is sample species that

241
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:52,399
would grow very close to those sources

242
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:54,759
but also in a controlled environment as

243
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:56,320
in you know ambient CO2 400 PPM more or

244
00:09:54,759 --> 00:10:00,120
less so that we could compare between

245
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:02,079
the two um so for in inance this is

246
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:03,839
panic grass that you see on the photo

247
00:10:02,078 --> 00:10:07,199
I'll point it here for the for the zoom

248
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:09,720
uh attendance so Panic grass is is

249
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:12,278
famous for growing close to these uh

250
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:14,759
sources in Yellowstone it has adapted to

251
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:16,759
that environment and it only grows there

252
00:10:14,759 --> 00:10:18,360
so for us that was the first species we

253
00:10:16,759 --> 00:10:19,759
we thought of targeting but it turned

254
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:21,919
out not to be useful because we had no

255
00:10:19,759 --> 00:10:25,319
control we had no comparison to an

256
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:26,879
ambient um but then PR vulgaris which is

257
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:29,680
actually a very common plant that grows

258
00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:33,360
in lots of environments including close

259
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:36,399
to the uh CO2 sources uh as well as in a

260
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:39,000
more ambient uh environment so 400 PPM

261
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:41,320
CO2 so this is a species we could really

262
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,759
compare U between the high and the

263
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:46,519
ambient CO2

264
00:10:43,759 --> 00:10:48,838
environments another attribute of prella

265
00:10:46,519 --> 00:10:51,519
that was very useful for our work is

266
00:10:48,839 --> 00:10:54,200
that it uh doesn't like to close its

267
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:56,720
tomata in the in the sense that you know

268
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:58,959
even when we harvested uh samples from

269
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:01,519
the field uh took them to the lab for

270
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:03,719
experim exp their stomata would still be

271
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:06,120
open uh and this is important if we want

272
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:07,639
to study gas exchange obviously so had

273
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:09,799
they closed their stomata there would be

274
00:11:07,639 --> 00:11:11,240
another no-o but so prella was very

275
00:11:09,799 --> 00:11:13,838
helpful in that regard that we could

276
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:15,399
really study photosynthesis effects even

277
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:17,720
when we had taken them from the field

278
00:11:15,399 --> 00:11:17,720
into the

279
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:25,639
lab um so then we so we wanted to study

280
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:28,559
the effects of CO2 levels on

281
00:11:25,639 --> 00:11:30,278
photosynthesis um so so this is

282
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:32,359
basically what we wanted the study right

283
00:11:30,278 --> 00:11:36,039
close to this Risco enzyme that fixes

284
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:38,039
CO2 but to measure this uh directly it's

285
00:11:36,039 --> 00:11:40,240
kind of hard I mean you can measure gas

286
00:11:38,039 --> 00:11:41,240
exchange but then there's a lot of well

287
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:43,919
first of all it's an indirect

288
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:46,480
measurement because you measure Co a net

289
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:48,120
CO2 uptake but where the CO2 goes and

290
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:50,560
how fast it reaches rubis you don't

291
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:53,078
really know uh plus it takes a lot of

292
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:55,958
time and we wanted to look at dark to

293
00:11:53,078 --> 00:11:57,958
light induction of photosynthesis which

294
00:11:55,958 --> 00:12:00,958
is a dynamic that we needed to more high

295
00:11:57,958 --> 00:12:03,599
resolution time resolution measurements

296
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:05,319
so instead we use a method that's called

297
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:08,519
chlorophyll variable

298
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:10,560
foressence um and this is fluoresence

299
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:12,759
that's emitted from from photosystem to

300
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:16,518
so from the light reactions that produce

301
00:12:12,759 --> 00:12:18,159
ATP and adph for the celvin cycle as you

302
00:12:16,519 --> 00:12:21,198
can see here sort of in a simplified

303
00:12:18,159 --> 00:12:24,600
scheme of photosynthesis so the way this

304
00:12:21,198 --> 00:12:28,919
works is that uh photo photos system two

305
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:31,639
um absorbs the light energy and then um

306
00:12:28,919 --> 00:12:33,240
it gets excited and then uh charge

307
00:12:31,639 --> 00:12:36,198
separation happens and the electron can

308
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:40,079
be transferred to its primary electron

309
00:12:36,198 --> 00:12:41,679
acceptor QA called QA and then from QA

310
00:12:40,078 --> 00:12:44,439
once it's reduced it can then again

311
00:12:41,679 --> 00:12:45,958
transfer the electron to PQ a

312
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:47,800
plastoquinone that then is converted

313
00:12:45,958 --> 00:12:50,239
into plastic quinol and then from there

314
00:12:47,799 --> 00:12:55,000
on in a series of reactions eventually

315
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:57,519
nadph nadp plus is reduced to NPH and by

316
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:01,240
pumping protons across the thid membrane

317
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:04,278
at the same time we produce a proton

318
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:06,879
gradient that is used to produce ATP so

319
00:13:04,278 --> 00:13:09,120
that's the connection but now once this

320
00:13:06,879 --> 00:13:11,159
has happen so photosystem 2 has gotten

321
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,360
excited it has transferred its electron

322
00:13:11,159 --> 00:13:15,319
there's only one

323
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:17,919
acceptor so at that point we say PS2 is

324
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:19,480
closed it cannot take another electron

325
00:13:17,919 --> 00:13:23,319
right because it's closed it I mean

326
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:26,399
there the carrier already has one now if

327
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:28,360
the um the pigment gets excited the it

328
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:30,799
the energy cannot be transferred through

329
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:33,480
the electron it gets emitted as

330
00:13:30,799 --> 00:13:35,120
fluorescence so that means that as long

331
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:37,600
as photochemistry can be done the

332
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:39,879
electron can be transferred we have no

333
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:41,759
fluoresence but if it's as soon as the

334
00:13:39,879 --> 00:13:44,320
system is closed we get fluoresence so

335
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:48,399
we have sort of a probe of the

336
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:50,199
photosynthesis activity by by measuring

337
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:52,198
fluoresence and there's also a little

338
00:13:50,198 --> 00:13:55,278
bit of energy that can be released as

339
00:13:52,198 --> 00:13:56,758
heat um but uh yeah I'll go into that

340
00:13:55,278 --> 00:13:59,320
later we have a measurement technique

341
00:13:56,759 --> 00:14:01,399
that that really we can tease out the

342
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:02,879
variable portion of fluoresence and that

343
00:14:01,399 --> 00:14:06,198
is not so sensitive to the portion that

344
00:14:02,879 --> 00:14:09,078
goes into into heat but that that is an

345
00:14:06,198 --> 00:14:10,838
issue when interpreting this kind of of

346
00:14:09,078 --> 00:14:13,278
observations so that's what we're going

347
00:14:10,839 --> 00:14:16,240
to do we're going to monitor fluoresence

348
00:14:13,278 --> 00:14:18,679
emission from photosystem 2 as a probe

349
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:21,278
for what is happening in these chain of

350
00:14:18,679 --> 00:14:24,519
reactions that eventually produces the

351
00:14:21,278 --> 00:14:26,439
compounds that run the celvin cycle and

352
00:14:24,519 --> 00:14:29,639
thereby we can say something about

353
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:32,199
whether or not CO2 is being uh r Bo

354
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:36,240
taken up to form

355
00:14:32,198 --> 00:14:38,319
tubers um all right so then uh another

356
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:40,198
thing I need to say in case you people

357
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:42,639
are uh familiar with the fluoresence

358
00:14:40,198 --> 00:14:44,319
method the that the method that's called

359
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:46,560
Pam fluorometry I don't know if you're

360
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:48,839
familiar with this this has been used a

361
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:50,638
lot in photosynthesis research this

362
00:14:48,839 --> 00:14:53,519
technique is slightly different in that

363
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:56,399
it uses it's called Fast repetition rate

364
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:59,278
barometry it uses Ultra short

365
00:14:56,399 --> 00:15:02,039
high-intensity light pulses

366
00:14:59,278 --> 00:15:04,720
um to excite the chlorophyll pigment

367
00:15:02,039 --> 00:15:06,879
photosystem 2 and then measure as you

368
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:08,800
can see on on the bottom so it measures

369
00:15:06,879 --> 00:15:12,078
the chlorophyll florescence that rises

370
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:14,879
as you as you you know shoot light on on

371
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:17,359
on the pigment um and then as the

372
00:15:14,879 --> 00:15:20,078
photochemistry goes down because the

373
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:22,278
system gets closed right this QA uh gets

374
00:15:20,078 --> 00:15:24,879
reduced we see the the rise in

375
00:15:22,278 --> 00:15:27,439
fluoresence then we flash at a flash

376
00:15:24,879 --> 00:15:30,480
rate of 100 Hertz so we have this Ultra

377
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:32,800
short pulse we measure of resence we

378
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:35,199
wait about 10 milliseconds then right at

379
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:38,519
100 HZ flash rate frequency then we get

380
00:15:35,198 --> 00:15:41,159
a little bit of reopening of the system

381
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:44,159
right some of the QA gets reoxidized in

382
00:15:41,159 --> 00:15:46,679
that time frame so fluoresence goes down

383
00:15:44,159 --> 00:15:49,120
again we flash again lence goes up but

384
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:50,159
the variable portion is much smaller now

385
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:52,759
right because the system is still

386
00:15:50,159 --> 00:15:54,639
partially closed so we continue to flash

387
00:15:52,759 --> 00:15:57,240
and we monitor variable fresen so this

388
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:59,560
is typically what this looks like for 50

389
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:01,680
flashes in a row

390
00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:04,919
and this is the variable portion of

391
00:16:01,679 --> 00:16:07,039
fluoresence normalized by the maximum of

392
00:16:04,919 --> 00:16:10,919
the fluoresence at that par particular

393
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:12,318
flash moment so the the the maximum FM

394
00:16:10,919 --> 00:16:15,399
right

395
00:16:12,318 --> 00:16:17,639
here um and so what we see happening is

396
00:16:15,399 --> 00:16:20,159
that as we continue to flesh it becomes

397
00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:22,318
harder and harder to reoxidize between

398
00:16:20,159 --> 00:16:24,399
flashes so in the end the variable

399
00:16:22,318 --> 00:16:26,399
portion goes almost down to zero meaning

400
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:28,679
the system's completely closed right we

401
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:32,039
can't reopen it between flashes anymore

402
00:16:28,679 --> 00:16:35,120
so QA got reduced the PQ pool if you re

403
00:16:32,039 --> 00:16:37,078
uh remember got completely reduced the

404
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:40,759
system is stuck right at that point it

405
00:16:37,078 --> 00:16:43,239
can't it can't do further

406
00:16:40,759 --> 00:16:45,159
photochemistry um but then we continue

407
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:47,639
to flash so oh yeah and another thing I

408
00:16:45,159 --> 00:16:50,120
should explain is we we see sort of the

409
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:51,600
oscillations here at the at the start of

410
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:54,120
the of the flash train so this is a dark

411
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:56,600
adapted sample and what these

412
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:58,318
oscillations represent is the oxygen

413
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:01,159
Evolution from the water oxidation

414
00:16:58,318 --> 00:17:03,240
complex this happens in four steps and

415
00:17:01,159 --> 00:17:05,279
that is why you see these um

416
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:06,880
oscillations so that's another

417
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:08,918
interesting feature of this technique

418
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:11,400
that you can actually measure that the

419
00:17:08,919 --> 00:17:14,160
oxygen Evolution from photos system

420
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:16,759
too all right so now we do not one flash

421
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:20,439
train but we continue to flash in total

422
00:17:16,759 --> 00:17:23,359
we flash 180 trains of 50 flashes each

423
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:25,400
so the first uh train looks like what I

424
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:27,678
just showed right so we have we started

425
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:30,240
with an open signal uh system dark

426
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:33,960
adapted we start to flash we close the

427
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:36,279
system and then we wait a half second

428
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:38,600
again the system partially reopens we

429
00:17:36,279 --> 00:17:40,599
flash again we wait a half second flash

430
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:42,159
again so we see a series of trains we

431
00:17:40,599 --> 00:17:44,599
see the system reopening closing

432
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:48,000
reopening closing so we're probing the

433
00:17:44,599 --> 00:17:50,359
reduction of the system by by by

434
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,919
flashing uh by these light

435
00:17:50,359 --> 00:17:54,879
flashes um and then what we hope to see

436
00:17:52,919 --> 00:17:58,200
eventually is that the system will

437
00:17:54,880 --> 00:18:01,200
reopen once the electrons are used to

438
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:04,519
produce energy adph and adph is going to

439
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:06,558
be used in the Calin cycle so it gets

440
00:18:04,519 --> 00:18:08,720
reoxidized and that means it can receive

441
00:18:06,558 --> 00:18:11,240
more electrons right So eventually you

442
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:14,120
should see this shift of the electrons

443
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:15,960
being moved into the celvin cycle and

444
00:18:14,119 --> 00:18:19,158
then we can again reoxidize between

445
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:21,440
trains we expect the system to to rise

446
00:18:19,159 --> 00:18:24,880
again all right so let's see if that

447
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:26,720
happens so this is the the the result

448
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:32,159
fluorescence variable fluoresence over

449
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:34,279
180 trains 9,000 flashes in total um so

450
00:18:32,159 --> 00:18:36,960
the the the start of the of the very

451
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:39,359
first flash is this dark adapted varable

452
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:42,038
foressence value also called the the

453
00:18:39,359 --> 00:18:44,319
maximum Quantum yeld of PS2 right that's

454
00:18:42,038 --> 00:18:46,759
what people have who have used perometry

455
00:18:44,319 --> 00:18:48,439
you're familiar with then we see the

456
00:18:46,759 --> 00:18:50,640
system closing right it goes all the way

457
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:53,200
down like we saw but now it's just

458
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:55,280
squeezed um but then indeed we do see

459
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:57,798
the system reopening right we see sort

460
00:18:55,279 --> 00:19:00,038
of the overall levels Rising a little

461
00:18:57,798 --> 00:19:03,000
bit but then they fall so the system

462
00:19:00,038 --> 00:19:05,599
starts to open but then closes again and

463
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:09,079
then eventually after yeah about a

464
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:11,639
minute we see an overall rise of the

465
00:19:09,079 --> 00:19:15,798
fluorescence levels and this is then the

466
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:17,960
signal for us uh to to see to observe

467
00:19:15,798 --> 00:19:19,798
the reopening of the system by the

468
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:22,440
downstream reactions in the Calvin

469
00:19:19,798 --> 00:19:24,798
cycle so this portion in particular we

470
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:26,919
expect to be very sensitive to CO2 right

471
00:19:24,798 --> 00:19:29,319
because that's the Risco enzyme

472
00:19:26,919 --> 00:19:31,799
activity um yeah then the other thing is

473
00:19:29,319 --> 00:19:33,918
we see this very wide sort of Comb width

474
00:19:31,798 --> 00:19:35,759
right so this is the difference between

475
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:37,840
the start of the train so we have a half

476
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:41,798
you wait a half second between the flash

477
00:19:37,839 --> 00:19:44,279
trains so we weop the system partially

478
00:19:41,798 --> 00:19:46,319
and then we fill it again so this is

479
00:19:44,279 --> 00:19:48,960
sort of a measure of how much electrons

480
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:51,240
come in and are taken out during the

481
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,240
flash

482
00:19:51,519 --> 00:19:57,000
train um yeah so this is the

483
00:19:54,960 --> 00:20:00,200
overall monitoring that we're going to

484
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,519
do with samples from Yellowstone in the

485
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:03,440
ambient environment as well as the

486
00:20:01,519 --> 00:20:07,720
extreme CO2

487
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:10,038
environment all right um then yeah so

488
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:11,360
this sort of summarizes this uh what I

489
00:20:10,038 --> 00:20:13,599
was just saying that what we are

490
00:20:11,359 --> 00:20:16,000
monitoring with this right in particular

491
00:20:13,599 --> 00:20:18,359
this the rise in variable resence which

492
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,798
is for us a signal uh of the of the

493
00:20:18,359 --> 00:20:21,519
Calvin cycle

494
00:20:19,798 --> 00:20:24,720
activity all right and then the

495
00:20:21,519 --> 00:20:27,279
reduction the the comb width that shows

496
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:29,440
us uh the ratio sort of between the

497
00:20:27,279 --> 00:20:31,519
light reactions that that push the

498
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:34,679
electrons in and the utilization in dark

499
00:20:31,519 --> 00:20:36,918
reactions that use nadph and therefore

500
00:20:34,679 --> 00:20:39,038
reopen the

501
00:20:36,919 --> 00:20:40,799
system all right now let's see what

502
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:42,679
happens when we so this is still an

503
00:20:40,798 --> 00:20:46,000
ambient sample right so it's just used

504
00:20:42,679 --> 00:20:47,600
to 400 PPM CO2 but now we're exposing it

505
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,599
to 6,000

506
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:53,798
PPM as you know the samples we found in

507
00:20:50,599 --> 00:20:56,639
in in Yellowstone so this sample clearly

508
00:20:53,798 --> 00:20:59,558
responds and as we expected especially

509
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:02,200
this last phase associated with the

510
00:20:59,558 --> 00:21:04,359
uptake of nadph or the utilization in

511
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:07,159
the Calvin cycle responds very strongly

512
00:21:04,359 --> 00:21:09,158
right we see all the levels Rises Rising

513
00:21:07,159 --> 00:21:12,400
so the system stays much more open the

514
00:21:09,159 --> 00:21:14,400
electrons just flow through much faster

515
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:16,360
uh and also even between trains we don't

516
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,519
fully close the system anymore right

517
00:21:16,359 --> 00:21:20,038
because the electrons can really be

518
00:21:17,519 --> 00:21:22,918
pumped forward very fast so this is sort

519
00:21:20,038 --> 00:21:25,278
of what we expected uh as a as a very

520
00:21:22,919 --> 00:21:28,600
strong effect of CO2 we also see that

521
00:21:25,278 --> 00:21:30,960
the initial levels uh are rising right

522
00:21:28,599 --> 00:21:33,439
so even very early on electrons are

523
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:36,558
already being taken out of the system uh

524
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:36,558
and and can be used down

525
00:21:36,599 --> 00:21:42,158
stream all right so fast strong

526
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:44,640
acceleration of uh of the uh of the

527
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:48,000
reactions in the electron transport

528
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:50,679
chain faster rise uh faster overall

529
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,038
levels all right now we're going to do

530
00:21:50,679 --> 00:21:54,519
the same thing but we're going to look

531
00:21:52,038 --> 00:21:56,278
at plants from Yellowstone National Park

532
00:21:54,519 --> 00:21:58,158
that have grown in this extremely high

533
00:21:56,278 --> 00:22:01,278
CO2 environment so they were always

534
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:02,760
exposed to 6,000 PPM now the first thing

535
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:06,679
we see when we just look at the plant

536
00:22:02,759 --> 00:22:09,038
samples is that uh they're not doing

537
00:22:06,679 --> 00:22:11,480
great in the high CO2

538
00:22:09,038 --> 00:22:14,679
environment um that we see strong signs

539
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:17,000
of chlorosis uh we see the leaf sizes

540
00:22:14,679 --> 00:22:20,640
that are uh small smaller yeah the

541
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,599
overall PR is looks very unhappy um and

542
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:23,600
now we're going to do the same

543
00:22:21,599 --> 00:22:26,439
experiments looking at the fluorescent

544
00:22:23,599 --> 00:22:28,879
signal from from these plants so first

545
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:30,558
we take the adapted plant I'm going to

546
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:33,320
call it adaptive PL so this that has

547
00:22:30,558 --> 00:22:38,359
grown in 6,000 PPM CO2 and we're going

548
00:22:33,319 --> 00:22:40,918
to give it just 400 PPM CO2 and see what

549
00:22:38,359 --> 00:22:43,479
happens and basically what we see is

550
00:22:40,919 --> 00:22:45,400
well sort of the start of the experiment

551
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:48,960
so we start out with a dark adapted

552
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:50,759
sample then we start filling reducing QA

553
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:52,798
we start filling the PQ pool gets

554
00:22:50,759 --> 00:22:54,720
reduced that sort of looks the same

555
00:22:52,798 --> 00:22:58,119
right the signals go down they come up a

556
00:22:54,720 --> 00:23:00,880
little bit but then they close again but

557
00:22:58,119 --> 00:23:02,719
in the this second phase that we

558
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:05,000
associate with the Calvin cycle

559
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:07,480
activity we basically see nothing

560
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:09,759
happening right the signal stays

561
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:11,558
down so it looks like it's not

562
00:23:09,759 --> 00:23:13,480
activating the Calin cycle it's not able

563
00:23:11,558 --> 00:23:16,359
to take the electrons out of the system

564
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:18,200
but the system stays closed uh all the

565
00:23:16,359 --> 00:23:21,079
time all right now let's see what

566
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:23,159
happens if we give it 6,000 PPM CO2

567
00:23:21,079 --> 00:23:26,519
right like what it's used used

568
00:23:23,159 --> 00:23:29,400
to and boom we see more or less the same

569
00:23:26,519 --> 00:23:32,278
response as in the ambient

570
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:35,240
sample so as soon as we give it plenty

571
00:23:32,278 --> 00:23:38,159
of CO2 it can fully restore the Calin

572
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:40,880
cycle activity so the overall levels

573
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:43,039
reached are as you can see this more or

574
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:45,320
less the same and also we see this much

575
00:23:43,038 --> 00:23:48,319
narrower comb width so also between the

576
00:23:45,319 --> 00:23:51,240
trains right it can really very fast it

577
00:23:48,319 --> 00:23:54,359
is able to reoxidize the system each

578
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:56,120
time um the only difference slight

579
00:23:54,359 --> 00:23:57,719
difference that we see is that we see a

580
00:23:56,119 --> 00:23:59,759
sort of a downgoing slope here towards

581
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:01,480
the end of the experiment expent so

582
00:23:59,759 --> 00:24:03,519
there is some kind of Downstream

583
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:05,640
limitation here that starts to play a

584
00:24:03,519 --> 00:24:07,759
role which we attribute to if you

585
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:10,679
remember the Kelvin cycle there we also

586
00:24:07,759 --> 00:24:13,558
we not only need to fix CO2 but for that

587
00:24:10,679 --> 00:24:15,519
we use ribulose B phosphate that needs

588
00:24:13,558 --> 00:24:17,678
to be regenerated through the cycle in

589
00:24:15,519 --> 00:24:20,119
order to take up the next CO2 molecule

590
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:22,798
so we think that is a limitation in that

591
00:24:20,119 --> 00:24:25,319
Downstream step for regenerating rulos B

592
00:24:22,798 --> 00:24:27,839
phosphate because you can accelerate the

593
00:24:25,319 --> 00:24:30,439
carox reaction but you need the rest of

594
00:24:27,839 --> 00:24:32,278
the cycle to follow right so that's what

595
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:34,720
could be going on

596
00:24:32,278 --> 00:24:37,480
here

597
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:39,240
um all right now this is a slide that

598
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:41,519
summarizes the results so far I've been

599
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:43,880
showing results for for single samples

600
00:24:41,519 --> 00:24:46,398
right so this the box plot summarize

601
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:48,080
data for uh the replicates so we have

602
00:24:46,398 --> 00:24:51,639
three to six replicates for each of

603
00:24:48,079 --> 00:24:54,359
these groups so we have an adapted group

604
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:57,120
uh and we have uh a control group

605
00:24:54,359 --> 00:24:58,879
exposed to 400 PPM exposed to 6,000 PPM

606
00:24:57,119 --> 00:25:01,918
just like I was

607
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:03,600
this the observation I was just showing

608
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:07,320
and I'm just going to summarize the

609
00:25:03,599 --> 00:25:08,839
results so first when we look at um

610
00:25:07,319 --> 00:25:11,038
phase one right so the start of the

611
00:25:08,839 --> 00:25:13,079
experiment dark adapted sample we look

612
00:25:11,038 --> 00:25:16,038
at what happens the maximum Quantum

613
00:25:13,079 --> 00:25:18,119
yield of P of PS2 we basically see no

614
00:25:16,038 --> 00:25:19,798
significant difference between the box

615
00:25:18,119 --> 00:25:21,759
plots right so meaning that there's no

616
00:25:19,798 --> 00:25:24,798
significant difference between control

617
00:25:21,759 --> 00:25:27,720
and adapted plants CO2 doesn't have an

618
00:25:24,798 --> 00:25:30,519
effect then when we look at the PQ pool

619
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:33,679
size so the next step right we reduce QA

620
00:25:30,519 --> 00:25:35,038
and then we reduce the PQ pool uh same

621
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:37,240
thing right so this is where the signal

622
00:25:35,038 --> 00:25:38,879
goes down in the first train that

623
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:40,960
difference is

624
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:43,559
also more or less the same no

625
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:44,759
significant difference between uh the

626
00:25:43,558 --> 00:25:48,079
the

627
00:25:44,759 --> 00:25:50,640
groups then um when we look at what

628
00:25:48,079 --> 00:25:52,278
we've called uh phase two so we saw that

629
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:53,799
the signal going down again right so

630
00:25:52,278 --> 00:25:57,599
there is an intermediate

631
00:25:53,798 --> 00:25:59,398
Downstream uh bottleneck where what we

632
00:25:57,599 --> 00:26:00,678
think is happening the full chain gets

633
00:25:59,398 --> 00:26:04,158
reduced right so

634
00:26:00,679 --> 00:26:05,919
nadph gets formed and waiting to be

635
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:08,760
utilized by the Calin cycle so there we

636
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:11,640
get a sort of intermediate stop or or

637
00:26:08,759 --> 00:26:13,720
slowing down again we see that happening

638
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:14,880
more or less similarly for all the for

639
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:17,798
all the

640
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:19,960
groups no clear CO2 effect no clear

641
00:26:17,798 --> 00:26:23,200
effect between the different sample

642
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:25,600
groups but then for phase three we

643
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:27,360
clearly see as we saw in this in if you

644
00:26:25,599 --> 00:26:30,038
remember there was this very wide comb

645
00:26:27,359 --> 00:26:33,439
WID and the levels weren't Rising right

646
00:26:30,038 --> 00:26:35,640
so much lower celvin cycle activity um

647
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:40,480
for the adapted plant in ambient

648
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:40,480
CO2 uh but it's restored in in higher

649
00:26:40,558 --> 00:26:44,918
CO2 um the same thing for this the comb

650
00:26:43,159 --> 00:26:48,080
width right so the reoxidation between

651
00:26:44,919 --> 00:26:50,360
the trains um yeah we also here we again

652
00:26:48,079 --> 00:26:53,240
we see a clear effect for the adapted

653
00:26:50,359 --> 00:26:57,359
plants compared to the to the control a

654
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:58,919
clear CO2 effect to start with um and a

655
00:26:57,359 --> 00:27:01,479
somewhat different between the control

656
00:26:58,919 --> 00:27:03,480
and the Adaptive

657
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:05,079
plant uh and then the other thing I

658
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:08,679
mentioned is this Downstream limitation

659
00:27:05,079 --> 00:27:11,439
by rulos B phosphate um we also sort of

660
00:27:08,679 --> 00:27:14,559
see that starting to appear mainly for

661
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:17,000
the adapted samples and mainly in

662
00:27:14,558 --> 00:27:20,398
exposed to high

663
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:22,558
CO2 all right so now we see an an

664
00:27:20,398 --> 00:27:25,398
adaptation effect right in associated

665
00:27:22,558 --> 00:27:27,599
with the celvin cycle activity but how

666
00:27:25,398 --> 00:27:30,199
can we explain it right how what exactly

667
00:27:27,599 --> 00:27:31,879
can be behind this this

668
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:33,798
difference now for that we're going to

669
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:35,919
look at the yeah more the the the

670
00:27:33,798 --> 00:27:38,639
various steps in the photosynthetic

671
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:40,679
electron transport chain so the way we

672
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:44,480
often think about it is sort of as a as

673
00:27:40,679 --> 00:27:48,080
a linear uh response right so we have uh

674
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:51,558
more light more uh nadph ATP being

675
00:27:48,079 --> 00:27:54,439
produced more CO2 uptake right sort of a

676
00:27:51,558 --> 00:27:57,359
z electrons flow through linearly and

677
00:27:54,440 --> 00:28:01,759
then are products are used by the Calin

678
00:27:57,359 --> 00:28:05,918
Cy but when you do this then the ratio

679
00:28:01,759 --> 00:28:07,519
of ATP over nadph that needs to be 3:2

680
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:09,759
is is not correct you don't get the

681
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:12,759
right ratio so we need to produce some

682
00:28:09,759 --> 00:28:14,038
extra uh ATP in order to be able to run

683
00:28:12,759 --> 00:28:17,319
the celvin

684
00:28:14,038 --> 00:28:20,359
cycle so the sort of solution that is

685
00:28:17,319 --> 00:28:23,599
invented uh By Nature to do this is

686
00:28:20,359 --> 00:28:26,918
called cyclic electron flow so electrons

687
00:28:23,599 --> 00:28:29,519
pass through the system um reach a

688
00:28:26,919 --> 00:28:32,200
photos system from photo system 2 to

689
00:28:29,519 --> 00:28:35,399
photos system one and then the electron

690
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:38,360
is not transferred to reduce nadp plus

691
00:28:35,398 --> 00:28:41,119
to nadph but instead is cycled back

692
00:28:38,359 --> 00:28:44,079
thereby pumping an extra proton that can

693
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:47,359
then be used to to produce more

694
00:28:44,079 --> 00:28:50,759
ATP so that's that's so it's all about

695
00:28:47,359 --> 00:28:52,678
tuning this the linear versus cyclic uh

696
00:28:50,759 --> 00:28:54,079
reactions uh because if you would only

697
00:28:52,679 --> 00:28:55,640
do cyclic mode obviously you're not

698
00:28:54,079 --> 00:28:58,678
going to have enough

699
00:28:55,640 --> 00:29:00,559
inph so that is that is the trick right

700
00:28:58,679 --> 00:29:03,759
for the plant is to to make sure that

701
00:29:00,558 --> 00:29:05,558
these two systems are tuned correctly

702
00:29:03,759 --> 00:29:07,319
and what we think is going on or and

703
00:29:05,558 --> 00:29:09,038
another thing I should say is that this

704
00:29:07,319 --> 00:29:10,960
has been shown Al in the literature is

705
00:29:09,038 --> 00:29:13,879
that when plants are dark adapted they

706
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:16,399
start out in cyclic electron flow

707
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:18,120
mode uh so they start out in this mode

708
00:29:16,398 --> 00:29:19,558
it sort of makes sense that at the start

709
00:29:18,119 --> 00:29:21,959
they the first thing they start to do is

710
00:29:19,558 --> 00:29:23,558
to produce ATP because ATP can be used

711
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:26,319
for a lot of purposes right in the is

712
00:29:23,558 --> 00:29:29,079
beneficial to do that but then as soon

713
00:29:26,319 --> 00:29:31,798
as the system sort of send is I also

714
00:29:29,079 --> 00:29:33,798
need nadph it then turns on the linear

715
00:29:31,798 --> 00:29:36,278
electron flow right so you get a

716
00:29:33,798 --> 00:29:39,038
transition uh until you get the right

717
00:29:36,278 --> 00:29:41,119
ratio so how we interpret our data is

718
00:29:39,038 --> 00:29:43,480
that because we we see this adapted

719
00:29:41,119 --> 00:29:46,518
plant and we see it's not activating the

720
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:49,480
Kelvin cycle so it's very likely that it

721
00:29:46,519 --> 00:29:50,720
is in cyclic mode but when it doesn't

722
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:53,558
get a lot of

723
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:56,399
CO2 it doesn't see sort of a reason

724
00:29:53,558 --> 00:29:58,200
right to kick on a linear flow because

725
00:29:56,398 --> 00:30:00,678
there is a very low Calin cycle activity

726
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:03,319
ity it stays in in cyclic mode and that

727
00:30:00,679 --> 00:30:05,120
could explain why we don't see a rise in

728
00:30:03,319 --> 00:30:08,960
fluoresence but then as soon as we give

729
00:30:05,119 --> 00:30:12,239
it 6,000 PPM it does start celvin cycle

730
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:13,880
activity it starts needing nadph and

731
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:15,558
then we do see the rise in fluoresence

732
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:19,919
we see the system opening

733
00:30:15,558 --> 00:30:22,599
up so um yeah to summarize that so what

734
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:25,399
we've seen for the CO2 adapted plants

735
00:30:22,599 --> 00:30:28,240
prella plants in in Yellowstone when we

736
00:30:25,398 --> 00:30:30,239
expose it to 400 PPM so much lower than

737
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:32,960
its growth environment we see that the

738
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:36,319
Calvin cycle basically stays

739
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:37,919
inactive um and we interpret this as in

740
00:30:36,319 --> 00:30:41,079
this dark to light induction that we're

741
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:43,159
looking at the the system the electral

742
00:30:41,079 --> 00:30:45,319
transport chain stays in cyclic electron

743
00:30:43,159 --> 00:30:47,278
flow mode so there's very little linear

744
00:30:45,319 --> 00:30:49,599
flow so there's very little nadph

745
00:30:47,278 --> 00:30:52,159
available for the Calin cycle to do

746
00:30:49,599 --> 00:30:54,480
carox and the advantage of that would be

747
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:56,559
for a plant that grows in a stressful

748
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:58,880
high CO2 but also highly acidifying

749
00:30:56,558 --> 00:31:01,720
environment is that is always ready to

750
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:03,559
make a lot of ATP which it can use then

751
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:06,679
for uh repair and

752
00:31:03,558 --> 00:31:09,240
homeostasis so that could could be an

753
00:31:06,679 --> 00:31:12,240
explanation um but then when we give it

754
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:14,519
6,000 PPM the Kelvin cycle does get

755
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:17,200
active to the same level even as as the

756
00:31:14,519 --> 00:31:19,278
control plant so this means that linear

757
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:21,960
electron flow must be activated now

758
00:31:19,278 --> 00:31:24,398
right as soon as there is a lot of uh

759
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:28,440
CO2 and then we get the right ratio in

760
00:31:24,398 --> 00:31:29,918
order to be able to run the Calvin cycle

761
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:32,320
uh now this is sort of confirmed by a

762
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:34,919
next set of experiments that we did so

763
00:31:32,319 --> 00:31:37,119
we had our three minute experiment 180

764
00:31:34,919 --> 00:31:39,038
trains but we repeated it sort of in a

765
00:31:37,119 --> 00:31:42,000
light fluctuation experiment so we have

766
00:31:39,038 --> 00:31:43,960
three minutes of uh light and then we

767
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,558
have four minutes uh this is just

768
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:47,399
practical because because we have to

769
00:31:45,558 --> 00:31:48,798
change the system uh four minutes of

770
00:31:47,398 --> 00:31:52,000
dark three minutes of light four minutes

771
00:31:48,798 --> 00:31:53,599
of dark and then also we start out uh

772
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,398
this example I mean we did lots of

773
00:31:53,599 --> 00:31:58,959
combinations but in this example we

774
00:31:55,398 --> 00:32:03,359
start out with ambient exposure 400

775
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:05,759
PPM uh two sequences then we Elevate CO2

776
00:32:03,359 --> 00:32:08,038
to 6,000 PPM and we do another two

777
00:32:05,759 --> 00:32:09,720
sequences and now if you think if you

778
00:32:08,038 --> 00:32:12,038
look at this with now having in mind

779
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:14,720
that we start out with cyclic flow so we

780
00:32:12,038 --> 00:32:18,440
start out with a system that closes very

781
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:20,639
rapidly and then it opens up in the the

782
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:24,120
upper level is a control plant right so

783
00:32:20,638 --> 00:32:26,398
it opens up meaning it transitions to

784
00:32:24,119 --> 00:32:29,558
more linear electron flow so that it can

785
00:32:26,398 --> 00:32:33,398
do uh celvin so that it can do carox and

786
00:32:29,558 --> 00:32:36,278
this does not happen in the uh adapted

787
00:32:33,398 --> 00:32:39,038
plant now if we wait for a minute in the

788
00:32:36,278 --> 00:32:41,319
dark we sort of get part restoration of

789
00:32:39,038 --> 00:32:42,798
this cyclic electron flow mode but when

790
00:32:41,319 --> 00:32:46,038
you look at the control plant it's able

791
00:32:42,798 --> 00:32:49,558
to start up cyc um Calvin cycle activity

792
00:32:46,038 --> 00:32:50,919
very fast right we we see the minimum

793
00:32:49,558 --> 00:32:53,119
remains much higher so meaning the

794
00:32:50,919 --> 00:32:55,320
system is already active it's it's able

795
00:32:53,119 --> 00:32:57,359
to stay much more open but this doesn't

796
00:32:55,319 --> 00:32:59,359
happen in the in the control plant not

797
00:32:57,359 --> 00:33:00,879
in Ambi which we didn't expect but even

798
00:32:59,359 --> 00:33:04,199
when we give it a lot of

799
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:06,320
CO2 we see the control plant being able

800
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:09,960
to stay almost completely open right we

801
00:33:06,319 --> 00:33:12,480
see it hardly going down so the system

802
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:15,000
doesn't get reduced it can reopen

803
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:16,720
straight away meaning that directly it

804
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,599
it establishes this balance right

805
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:21,519
between cyclic and linear electron

806
00:33:18,599 --> 00:33:23,918
flow uh not so for the adapted plant

807
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:26,440
right if we dark if we give it a dark

808
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:28,799
exposure for minutes we see the levels

809
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:30,159
going down it closes again

810
00:33:28,798 --> 00:33:34,119
from the start of the experiment and it

811
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:37,600
needs time it does open with 6,000 PPN

812
00:33:34,119 --> 00:33:39,839
but it take takes much longer for it to

813
00:33:37,599 --> 00:33:42,480
to activate and we do it again and we

814
00:33:39,839 --> 00:33:44,278
see the same thing what we also see is

815
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:46,839
this this negative slope starts to

816
00:33:44,278 --> 00:33:49,000
appear right as we continue to expose to

817
00:33:46,839 --> 00:33:50,638
light this Downstream limitation starts

818
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:53,038
to become more

819
00:33:50,638 --> 00:33:55,839
important um is what it looks like Bas

820
00:33:53,038 --> 00:33:58,158
based on this data so this this sort of

821
00:33:55,839 --> 00:34:00,359
fits the picture right with the two

822
00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:04,360
experiments so then to summarize our

823
00:34:00,359 --> 00:34:07,278
conclusions for the prella plant um yeah

824
00:34:04,359 --> 00:34:10,918
I'll just show them here 400 PPM we saw

825
00:34:07,278 --> 00:34:13,159
inact no activity on the Kelvin cycle uh

826
00:34:10,918 --> 00:34:15,279
what we think is caused by the system

827
00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:18,679
staying in cyclic electron flow mode

828
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:21,040
6,000 PPM we saw no evidence of effect

829
00:34:18,679 --> 00:34:22,000
on the light reactions right on the PS2

830
00:34:21,039 --> 00:34:24,398
light

831
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:26,440
reactions uh what we see is a transition

832
00:34:24,398 --> 00:34:28,000
from linear to cyclic oh this should be

833
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:29,720
the other way around I'm very sorry from

834
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,960
cyclic to linear flow when we go from

835
00:34:29,719 --> 00:34:34,358
dark to light uh is much

836
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:37,240
slower uh right this it close in between

837
00:34:34,358 --> 00:34:38,799
and only then could it activate um but

838
00:34:37,239 --> 00:34:40,000
then it becomes almost as active as the

839
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:42,440
more or less as active as the control

840
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:44,358
plant eventually which also tells us

841
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:46,720
that there is not really an adaptation

842
00:34:44,358 --> 00:34:49,039
in functional robiso content because

843
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:50,039
this has been an explanation uh a

844
00:34:49,039 --> 00:34:52,719
possible

845
00:34:50,039 --> 00:34:55,440
explanation uh for adaptation to higher

846
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:57,439
CO2 you would adjust your robiso content

847
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:59,119
right because it's yeah it doesn't work

848
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:01,800
need work as hard and it has a lot more

849
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:04,320
CO2 available but because it restores to

850
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:06,480
the same level as the control we think

851
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:08,920
that is probably not uh what is

852
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:10,960
happening in our adapted samples here so

853
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:13,200
that's also interesting to keep in

854
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:15,280
mind all right that brings me to the end

855
00:35:13,199 --> 00:35:16,639
of my talk I just like to thank a few

856
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:18,720
people first of all of course professor

857
00:35:16,639 --> 00:35:20,639
Charles Charles mukes from rodar

858
00:35:18,719 --> 00:35:22,159
University the Waxman Institute who

859
00:35:20,639 --> 00:35:24,078
introduced me to

860
00:35:22,159 --> 00:35:26,679
photosynthesis uh and with whom I've

861
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:28,400
been writing proposals uh to get us to

862
00:35:26,679 --> 00:35:30,358
to Yellowstone for these very

863
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:31,880
interesting experiments which have been

864
00:35:30,358 --> 00:35:34,199
supported by of course the National Park

865
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:36,680
Service Who provided the research permit

866
00:35:34,199 --> 00:35:38,799
the Waxman Institute Who provided a seed

867
00:35:36,679 --> 00:35:40,239
Grant to cover some of our travel costs

868
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:42,119
and the foru Federation in the

869
00:35:40,239 --> 00:35:43,919
Netherlands Who provided some of the

870
00:35:42,119 --> 00:35:48,200
instrumentation we have been using in

871
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:50,240
the field so with that I thank you for

872
00:35:48,199 --> 00:35:52,399
listening

873
00:35:50,239 --> 00:35:57,279
questions a

874
00:35:52,400 --> 00:36:00,838
couple go ahead how widely um dispersed

875
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:04,160
is this elevated

876
00:36:00,838 --> 00:36:07,799
CO2 around the high CO2 sources you mean

877
00:36:04,159 --> 00:36:11,440
yeah um scale yeah meter scale meter

878
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:12,839
scale very very low it is it is yeah

879
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:15,358
yeah yeah as soon as you're say more

880
00:36:12,838 --> 00:36:17,159
than 10 10 meters away in most cases the

881
00:36:15,358 --> 00:36:20,880
levels are back to also because of the

882
00:36:17,159 --> 00:36:22,920
air mixing you're back to ambient

883
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:24,960
CO2 yeah which is convenient because

884
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:26,960
we're sort of we're quite certain that

885
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:29,240
other than CO2 the plants are exposed to

886
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:31,280
the same environment same soils

887
00:36:29,239 --> 00:36:34,078
everything else

888
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:36,160
yeah yeah um so I was wondering you know

889
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:37,680
sometimes we see that when plants are in

890
00:36:36,159 --> 00:36:40,159
those conditions right they're exposed

891
00:36:37,679 --> 00:36:41,960
to extremely high CO2 maybe not

892
00:36:40,159 --> 00:36:44,279
necessarily adapted but if you were to

893
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:46,318
have a plant that was you know

894
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:48,960
synthetically just yeah in a plant that

895
00:36:46,318 --> 00:36:51,639
has a very high CO2 environment there's

896
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:53,838
trios phosphate utilization limitation

897
00:36:51,639 --> 00:36:56,400
that occurs and you know that could also

898
00:36:53,838 --> 00:36:59,000
limit the rate of poesis like do you

899
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:01,318
hypothesize that is some Ru and what

900
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:03,119
you're seeing yeah good point yeah this

901
00:37:01,318 --> 00:37:05,599
is another Downstream limitation that

902
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:07,000
could explain what we're seeing yeah

903
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:09,039
yeah yeah that's a good point especially

904
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:11,599
very high CO2 so we have a high

905
00:37:09,039 --> 00:37:13,239
production of sugars um and if they're

906
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:15,800
not moving out of the system fast enough

907
00:37:13,239 --> 00:37:20,078
then that also inhibits the reul

908
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:20,079
phosphate regeneration so yeah okay

909
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:26,680
yeah yeah um a colleague and I have been

910
00:37:24,599 --> 00:37:28,200
sort of thinking about doing some work

911
00:37:26,679 --> 00:37:29,799
at Yellowstone

912
00:37:28,199 --> 00:37:33,480
also with high

913
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:37,079
CO2 uh one of the things that we've been

914
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:41,358
spending some time thinking about is

915
00:37:37,079 --> 00:37:45,200
that these emissions are not just CO2

916
00:37:41,358 --> 00:37:49,279
there are other gases that are in there

917
00:37:45,199 --> 00:37:52,679
um that also can affect the soil

918
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:54,119
chemistry your adapted plant didn't look

919
00:37:52,679 --> 00:37:57,000
very

920
00:37:54,119 --> 00:37:59,760
healthy and I was wondering whether you

921
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:03,119
had any concerns about these other

922
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:05,800
stresses that the plant is under in

923
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:07,039
interpreting any of your resch yeah

924
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:08,400
that's a that's a that's a very good

925
00:38:07,039 --> 00:38:10,679
point yeah I should have mentioned that

926
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:13,240
we selected these sites because they're

927
00:38:10,679 --> 00:38:15,440
almost exclusively emitting CO2 and very

928
00:38:13,239 --> 00:38:18,239
low in sulfuric gases other types of

929
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:20,800
gases also relatively low in water vapor

930
00:38:18,239 --> 00:38:23,399
some of the sources emit 90% water vapor

931
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:26,119
and then a tiny bit of CO2 so they were

932
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:30,160
really selected the travor time deposits

933
00:38:26,119 --> 00:38:32,318
so they really emit mostly CO2 as a gas

934
00:38:30,159 --> 00:38:35,559
and very low in other gas compounds it

935
00:38:32,318 --> 00:38:37,079
could be yeah confusing our signal yeah

936
00:38:35,559 --> 00:38:39,960
did you do the monitoring of the

937
00:38:37,079 --> 00:38:40,640
emissions or did part USGS yeah this is

938
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:42,880
the

939
00:38:40,639 --> 00:38:44,719
USGS uh yeah we're taking from their

940
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:46,318
reports

941
00:38:44,719 --> 00:38:50,279
okay

942
00:38:46,318 --> 00:38:54,079
yeah did you uh studied any light

943
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:56,119
intensity based uh Cycles which could be

944
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:58,800
different in these two different

945
00:38:56,119 --> 00:39:02,519
environment I here we always use the S

946
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:03,960
the same uh lights schemes for the

947
00:39:02,519 --> 00:39:05,039
fluoresence measurements yeah so we

948
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:06,720
haven't played around that's another

949
00:39:05,039 --> 00:39:08,199
thing we could do indeed just play

950
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:10,679
around with different light intensities

951
00:39:08,199 --> 00:39:10,679
and see what

952
00:39:11,358 --> 00:39:17,279
happens HR data is very clear there is

953
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:21,119
adapt there is sort of acclamation or

954
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:24,880
adaptation but I think your data I think

955
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:26,160
all the conclusions are dependent on the

956
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:30,240
fluorescence

957
00:39:26,159 --> 00:39:34,920
data uh couple things first when you

958
00:39:30,239 --> 00:39:36,479
compare chlorophos assins at 400 PPM

959
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:40,519
versus 6,000

960
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:43,199
DPM in the first case you have

961
00:39:40,519 --> 00:39:46,639
photorespiration and the second in at

962
00:39:43,199 --> 00:39:49,480
6,000 PPM photorespiration probably is

963
00:39:46,639 --> 00:39:52,159
completely inhibited so the total

964
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:54,519
electron transport measured by

965
00:39:52,159 --> 00:39:58,318
choses so represent you know you have

966
00:39:54,519 --> 00:40:03,400
these two two sinks right mhm one is

967
00:39:58,318 --> 00:40:06,239
carbon dioxide reduction the other is

968
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:08,079
oxygenation so how do you differentiate

969
00:40:06,239 --> 00:40:11,039
those two that's the first question the

970
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:14,839
second question is you suggested that

971
00:40:11,039 --> 00:40:18,079
rubisco the amount of rubisco didn't

972
00:40:14,838 --> 00:40:21,719
change but you never measured this no we

973
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:23,960
did not yeah so I I really don't feel

974
00:40:21,719 --> 00:40:26,598
comfortable with that conclusion because

975
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:28,039
without directly measuring Risco the

976
00:40:26,599 --> 00:40:30,200
total amount

977
00:40:28,039 --> 00:40:32,838
it I you know be very difficult to make

978
00:40:30,199 --> 00:40:36,118
the conclusion that rco demount didn't

979
00:40:32,838 --> 00:40:38,559
change because cor is the indirect

980
00:40:36,119 --> 00:40:43,440
measur what you measuring is meing the

981
00:40:38,559 --> 00:40:46,719
live reactions so not direct not a

982
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:49,720
direct measurement of robis Med dark

983
00:40:46,719 --> 00:40:52,519
reactions no that's why that's exactly

984
00:40:49,719 --> 00:40:54,199
why I put functional Risco to start with

985
00:40:52,519 --> 00:40:57,000
because we didn't measure rubisco

986
00:40:54,199 --> 00:40:57,960
content okay uh but functional rubisco

987
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:00,358
because

988
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:02,800
if the robiso the functional robiso

989
00:41:00,358 --> 00:41:04,480
content would be very different they

990
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:06,599
would not the samples would not be

991
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:09,920
reaching the same variable foressence

992
00:41:06,599 --> 00:41:11,640
levels uh that that we're seeing the end

993
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:12,720
of the experiments right that that there

994
00:41:11,639 --> 00:41:14,519
would be differences when they're

995
00:41:12,719 --> 00:41:17,879
exposed to the same amount of the same

996
00:41:14,519 --> 00:41:19,318
levels of CO2 so that's why yeah we

997
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:22,039
pretty confident that this is the case

998
00:41:19,318 --> 00:41:24,880
yeah yeah but there's a way to directly

999
00:41:22,039 --> 00:41:27,559
measure the functional risal portion you

1000
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:29,480
can measure the initial activity that

1001
00:41:27,559 --> 00:41:31,119
represents the amount of risk that is

1002
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:33,119
active actively engaged in

1003
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:35,720
photosynthesis and they can measure the

1004
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:38,480
total amount of risk that's the total of

1005
00:41:35,719 --> 00:41:41,039
now so that's the ratio is called

1006
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:43,719
activation percentage of activation you

1007
00:41:41,039 --> 00:41:46,199
could directly measure the initial

1008
00:41:43,719 --> 00:41:48,439
activity of Risco to support this

1009
00:41:46,199 --> 00:41:49,838
conclusion I think right that would be

1010
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:51,400
much better yeah that would be very

1011
00:41:49,838 --> 00:41:52,960
interesting the thing is of course here

1012
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:55,358
we are in in Yellowstone National Park

1013
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:57,199
with very limited facilities so we build

1014
00:41:55,358 --> 00:41:58,960
up sort of an improvised lab to do the

1015
00:41:57,199 --> 00:42:00,318
these experiments but it's not easy to

1016
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:01,760
do every kind of measurement that would

1017
00:42:00,318 --> 00:42:04,039
be ideal you know to confirm all the

1018
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:06,640
conclusions but we do plan to do is to

1019
00:42:04,039 --> 00:42:08,838
go back uh with an instrument that can

1020
00:42:06,639 --> 00:42:12,118
also measure uh the oxidation state of

1021
00:42:08,838 --> 00:42:13,920
p700 so photosystem one and also to

1022
00:42:12,119 --> 00:42:16,599
measure the proton gradients which you

1023
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:18,760
can all all do with Optical measurements

1024
00:42:16,599 --> 00:42:20,559
so they're yeah relatively feasible for

1025
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:23,319
for this environment so that would at

1026
00:42:20,559 --> 00:42:24,680
least um we yeah with that we could

1027
00:42:23,318 --> 00:42:26,358
corroborate some of these conclusions

1028
00:42:24,679 --> 00:42:28,480
because I agree it's only one method I

1029
00:42:26,358 --> 00:42:29,719
fully agree but yeah so we we hope to

1030
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:32,920
fill some of the holes with these

1031
00:42:29,719 --> 00:42:35,239
additional measurements in the

1032
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:37,440
field yeah I'm going talk to you later

1033
00:42:35,239 --> 00:42:38,959
more detail about this I kind of agree

1034
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:41,639
it' be really great if we could like

1035
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:44,599
sort of reject the hypothesis that

1036
00:42:41,639 --> 00:42:47,598
involved um yeah and understanding the

1037
00:42:44,599 --> 00:42:49,720
field limitations there of course um I

1038
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:51,039
have a very naive question about what

1039
00:42:49,719 --> 00:42:54,078
the you're measuring with the

1040
00:42:51,039 --> 00:42:58,000
floressence is it riscal activity or is

1041
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:59,760
it essentially like I you DP reduction

1042
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,920
is that the Regeneration phase that's

1043
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:04,520
being

1044
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:08,000
measured what we measure is is a net uh

1045
00:43:04,519 --> 00:43:10,800
rate of uptake of electrons so yes so

1046
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:12,440
it's when the NAD Etc is being so it's

1047
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:16,880
that's in like when it's going from like

1048
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:19,159
3pga to g3p right so it's measuring the

1049
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:20,400
rate of RP regeneration essentially

1050
00:43:19,159 --> 00:43:24,039
which is consistent with when you're

1051
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:26,358
seeing like that down shift that's

1052
00:43:24,039 --> 00:43:28,159
limiting I just out of my head whether

1053
00:43:26,358 --> 00:43:30,279
that is

1054
00:43:28,159 --> 00:43:32,000
appr proxy for Risco activity or not but

1055
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:33,480
this could be a yeah maybe yeah maybe

1056
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:35,639
the terminology you're right maybe yeah

1057
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:37,318
correct my terminology if I'm wrong but

1058
00:43:35,639 --> 00:43:41,558
what what we really measure is the

1059
00:43:37,318 --> 00:43:45,239
utilization of n or the reoxidation of

1060
00:43:41,559 --> 00:43:46,800
nadph by the Calin cycle because we see

1061
00:43:45,239 --> 00:43:48,799
strong CO2 effect sort of confirms that

1062
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:51,640
it has to do with but I shouldn't call

1063
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:53,160
it Rob Risco activity because that is

1064
00:43:51,639 --> 00:43:55,920
not more be measure you're right I mean

1065
00:43:53,159 --> 00:43:59,039
the correct term is reoxidation of the

1066
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:59,039
electron transport chain

1067
00:43:59,559 --> 00:44:06,079
yeah um how much of the inability of the

1068
00:44:03,358 --> 00:44:07,799
adapted plants to use to efficiently use

1069
00:44:06,079 --> 00:44:10,280
the ambient levels of CO2 do you think

1070
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:13,599
is related to the chlorosis and the

1071
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:16,119
general like uh lack of health of the

1072
00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:18,200
plants that it would just be harder in

1073
00:44:16,119 --> 00:44:21,000
general for it to

1074
00:44:18,199 --> 00:44:23,199
photosynthesize uh it depends because if

1075
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:26,000
it's in its high CO2 environment it's

1076
00:44:23,199 --> 00:44:28,838
always exposed to 6,000 PPM it would be

1077
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:31,039
able to do photosynthesis right so then

1078
00:44:28,838 --> 00:44:32,679
that would not be causing the the

1079
00:44:31,039 --> 00:44:35,400
chlorosis that we

1080
00:44:32,679 --> 00:44:36,639
see um if on the other hand the CO2

1081
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:39,039
levels are

1082
00:44:36,639 --> 00:44:41,279
fluctuating because of air

1083
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:43,679
mixing then that would definitely be

1084
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:45,000
part of of the of the stresses right

1085
00:44:43,679 --> 00:44:46,279
because then it would be exposed

1086
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:48,239
sometimes to this very nice and high

1087
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:50,079
level but then it goes down it goes up

1088
00:44:48,239 --> 00:44:51,639
it goes down so then that would be part

1089
00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:53,559
of the

1090
00:44:51,639 --> 00:44:56,318
explanation

1091
00:44:53,559 --> 00:44:58,920
now I have two questions one is on that

1092
00:44:56,318 --> 00:45:00,318
part right there so so um when you when

1093
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:02,280
you take the Adaptive plants and they're

1094
00:45:00,318 --> 00:45:03,800
at the lower PPM that's where you see

1095
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:07,319
the cyclop kick in right and you're

1096
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:09,680
generating too much ATP relative to nadp

1097
00:45:07,318 --> 00:45:12,000
where does that ATP go if it doesn't

1098
00:45:09,679 --> 00:45:15,279
go where does it get shunted if it

1099
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:16,760
doesn't get used uh yeah well this is

1100
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:18,960
something I think a lot of you people

1101
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:22,160
know more about than me but ATP is used

1102
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:25,440
for a lot of processes in uh in living

1103
00:45:22,159 --> 00:45:27,318
cells as an energy carrier so how it

1104
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:28,480
gets shuttled out I'm not sure yeah so

1105
00:45:27,318 --> 00:45:30,400
because I was thinking maybe that's part

1106
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:32,559
of the the toxicity right if it's

1107
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:34,440
getting shunted into something that is

1108
00:45:32,559 --> 00:45:36,720
is hurting the plant then the ATP itself

1109
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:37,838
you mean yeah but did some thing but

1110
00:45:36,719 --> 00:45:42,239
then the other thing I wanted to ask you

1111
00:45:37,838 --> 00:45:44,480
is about so you have this swath of um

1112
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:47,118
the plant that's getting the high dosage

1113
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:50,960
and then the adjacent sloth is the

1114
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:54,119
control so if you if you take the high

1115
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:56,280
adapt and you I doubt you've done this

1116
00:45:54,119 --> 00:45:58,318
but maybe and you put it in a 400 PPM

1117
00:45:56,280 --> 00:46:01,040
and just keep it forever does it ever

1118
00:45:58,318 --> 00:46:03,759
acclimate back to 400 yeah that's a very

1119
00:46:01,039 --> 00:46:05,719
interesting question yeah yeah for that

1120
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:07,800
I mean so it would be hard to do in the

1121
00:46:05,719 --> 00:46:09,399
field I I mean we would be need to be

1122
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:11,000
sure to be able to come back every year

1123
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:13,160
and it has a very short season because

1124
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:16,519
we're at more than 2,000 feet 2,000

1125
00:46:13,159 --> 00:46:18,639
6,000 feet altitude um but this is

1126
00:46:16,519 --> 00:46:21,199
something we're thinking about if we can

1127
00:46:18,639 --> 00:46:23,039
bring the plants out of the we it is

1128
00:46:21,199 --> 00:46:26,598
included in our permit now that we can

1129
00:46:23,039 --> 00:46:28,639
bring plants back from the Fiel and then

1130
00:46:26,599 --> 00:46:30,440
we could see if in the greenhouse or in

1131
00:46:28,639 --> 00:46:32,239
growth Chambers we expose them to 400

1132
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:34,079
PPM and whether they react that would be

1133
00:46:32,239 --> 00:46:36,318
very interesting right to see if it's

1134
00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:39,960
elastic yeah and then also just to move

1135
00:46:36,318 --> 00:46:41,400
the 400 the 600 until you see a decline

1136
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:43,358
right the the first part of the

1137
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:46,200
hypothesis was that CO2 can be

1138
00:46:43,358 --> 00:46:50,159
detrimental at high right and so then to

1139
00:46:46,199 --> 00:46:51,118
like model that breakdown basically yeah

1140
00:46:50,159 --> 00:46:52,159
yeah that's something we need to find

1141
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:53,720
funding for though because that's going

1142
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:56,960
to be an extended set of experiments but

1143
00:46:53,719 --> 00:46:59,399
yeah yeah I'm thinking back about the

1144
00:46:56,960 --> 00:47:02,000
plants again are are there plants that

1145
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:05,280
are growing in this high CO2 environment

1146
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:07,239
that that actually look healthy because

1147
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:11,400
because the ones that you did show they

1148
00:47:07,239 --> 00:47:14,399
look pretty ragged and uh I'm trying to

1149
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:16,838
imagine the leaves that you would look

1150
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:19,519
at to do these experiments did did they

1151
00:47:16,838 --> 00:47:21,400
have did they have healthy leaves any

1152
00:47:19,519 --> 00:47:23,358
these plants there are lots smaller but

1153
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:24,960
they yeah some of the leaves do I mean

1154
00:47:23,358 --> 00:47:27,598
this in kind of measurement we do we

1155
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:29,599
need a small only a small portion of

1156
00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:31,720
to be healthy to do our measurements

1157
00:47:29,599 --> 00:47:34,400
okay so because the one I don't think

1158
00:47:31,719 --> 00:47:36,719
okay yeah no no that was a pretty crappy

1159
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:38,960
example you're right

1160
00:47:36,719 --> 00:47:41,078
yeah just before we go back to the crowd

1161
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:42,960
we have one quick one here yeah you

1162
00:47:41,079 --> 00:47:44,559
might want to just say it out loud yeah

1163
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:46,199
there's a question from the zoom

1164
00:47:44,559 --> 00:47:48,400
audience did you notice any differences

1165
00:47:46,199 --> 00:47:50,279
in stomato conductance at different CO2

1166
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:52,000
concentrations so this is sort of the

1167
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:55,880
nice thing about prella is that it

1168
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:57,199
didn't respond um very strongly in terms

1169
00:47:55,880 --> 00:47:59,119
of stomat conductance so so we took

1170
00:47:57,199 --> 00:48:01,279
stomat conductance measurements in the

1171
00:47:59,119 --> 00:48:03,400
field uh and we brought samples to the

1172
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:05,760
lab we measured in the lab and we didn't

1173
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:07,000
see strong differences I mean stom

1174
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:08,400
conductors there's a lot of variability

1175
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:10,960
to start with right when you me measure

1176
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:13,960
it in the field but that degree of

1177
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:17,280
variability and range didn't change for

1178
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:19,039
samples uh control or adapted and even

1179
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:23,599
when we brought them to the lab the

1180
00:48:19,039 --> 00:48:25,920
conductance um got smaller but the stata

1181
00:48:23,599 --> 00:48:27,440
did stay open and also to a similar uh

1182
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:29,720
degree more or less right within the

1183
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:30,400
variability range that is inherent

1184
00:48:29,719 --> 00:48:32,480
through the

1185
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:34,480
measurements you sort of mentioned this

1186
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:37,920
before but I just want to ask again how

1187
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:40,039
far apart were the exposed plants and

1188
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:42,559
the controlled plants Auto magnet to 10

1189
00:48:40,039 --> 00:48:47,000
meters excuse me 10 meters more or less

1190
00:48:42,559 --> 00:48:49,559
so that is uh 10 12 yards or yeah 30

1191
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:52,798
feet 30t that's about

1192
00:48:49,559 --> 00:48:55,200
30t you think

1193
00:48:52,798 --> 00:48:57,318
that's do you think your control plants

1194
00:48:55,199 --> 00:49:01,199
are really control plants I mean wind is

1195
00:48:57,318 --> 00:49:04,759
blowing this stuff every which direction

1196
00:49:01,199 --> 00:49:08,279
okay so if they're only 30 ft apart my

1197
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:11,319
guess is that at some point your control

1198
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:12,920
plants were being exposed to elevated

1199
00:49:11,318 --> 00:49:15,318
CO2

1200
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:17,358
also it's rather the other way around I

1201
00:49:15,318 --> 00:49:21,558
think because it's a it's a point source

1202
00:49:17,358 --> 00:49:23,719
of of of very high CO2 yes uh so plants

1203
00:49:21,559 --> 00:49:27,119
growing very close to that point source

1204
00:49:23,719 --> 00:49:29,199
do get the 6,000 PPM

1205
00:49:27,119 --> 00:49:30,519
where the stuff came up out of where the

1206
00:49:29,199 --> 00:49:32,199
within

1207
00:49:30,519 --> 00:49:34,838
within a

1208
00:49:32,199 --> 00:49:37,078
foot okay they grow directly at the edge

1209
00:49:34,838 --> 00:49:39,759
of the of the source yeah and the soil

1210
00:49:37,079 --> 00:49:44,119
is not hot so these are not hot sources

1211
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:44,119
they're really CO2 sources okay

1212
00:49:44,679 --> 00:49:52,118
yeah yeah is there like so 6,000 is that

1213
00:49:49,679 --> 00:49:53,879
the extreme that was identified that's

1214
00:49:52,119 --> 00:49:57,680
like consist like consistently around

1215
00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:59,000
6,000 around these out sources

1216
00:49:57,679 --> 00:50:02,318
this is the level that we measured out

1217
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:03,719
in the field at at about 6,000 PPM okay

1218
00:50:02,318 --> 00:50:07,759
there's been some sites where they found

1219
00:50:03,719 --> 00:50:10,199
up to 10,000 in the G USGS reports but

1220
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:12,760
those sites had no growth no vegetative

1221
00:50:10,199 --> 00:50:14,399
growth around them so right I yeah I was

1222
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:16,599
just wondering like if you were to

1223
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:18,119
measure with I'm not sure if this is

1224
00:50:16,599 --> 00:50:20,480
like by your design or not but if you

1225
00:50:18,119 --> 00:50:23,838
measured in sites that had low were like

1226
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:26,920
2,000 to 3000 PPM right so like some of

1227
00:50:23,838 --> 00:50:30,480
the gas exchange systems can ramp up CO2

1228
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:33,400
like about 3,000 right I mean if it's

1229
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:35,838
like you compromise some of the you know

1230
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:37,358
the extremity I guess of the CO2 level

1231
00:50:35,838 --> 00:50:39,838
but at the same time You' be able to

1232
00:50:37,358 --> 00:50:42,199
actually like get that CO2 assimilation

1233
00:50:39,838 --> 00:50:43,119
and get the direct parameters like you

1234
00:50:42,199 --> 00:50:44,679
think that'd be something you'd be

1235
00:50:43,119 --> 00:50:45,838
interested in doing in the future well

1236
00:50:44,679 --> 00:50:47,399
this is actually what we intended to do

1237
00:50:45,838 --> 00:50:50,440
when we went we thought about measuring

1238
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:52,480
along a transact with a over a range of

1239
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:54,000
CO2 concentrations but this turned out

1240
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:55,798
to be hard for exactly for that reason

1241
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:58,760
it's very hard to get something of a

1242
00:50:55,798 --> 00:51:00,960
stable CO2 concentration trans transient

1243
00:50:58,760 --> 00:51:03,319
in the field with all the other uh

1244
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:06,318
variations so we stuck to very high very

1245
00:51:03,318 --> 00:51:07,920
close to the source and then ambient far

1246
00:51:06,318 --> 00:51:10,759
away from Enough From the Source that we

1247
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:12,639
had a stable ambient what we did do I

1248
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:15,799
can show you that data in the

1249
00:51:12,639 --> 00:51:16,960
lab uh we because Panella is a common

1250
00:51:15,798 --> 00:51:19,400
plant right so you can actually just

1251
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:22,679
order it and grow it in the lab and then

1252
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:24,559
we did uh here we did the the range of

1253
00:51:22,679 --> 00:51:27,558
CO2 experiments where we we start out

1254
00:51:24,559 --> 00:51:30,160
with an ambient signal uh and then here

1255
00:51:27,559 --> 00:51:32,240
we expose it to just zero CO2 so you see

1256
00:51:30,159 --> 00:51:34,199
this last phase basically you system

1257
00:51:32,239 --> 00:51:36,838
staying closed and then we had a couple

1258
00:51:34,199 --> 00:51:38,358
of intermediate levels so 1600 3,000 and

1259
00:51:36,838 --> 00:51:40,838
6,000

1260
00:51:38,358 --> 00:51:43,920
PPM uh so these are lab grown samples

1261
00:51:40,838 --> 00:51:45,558
now so there we we yeah we able to

1262
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:47,559
control a lot more things these are so

1263
00:51:45,559 --> 00:51:48,960
they're grown in ambient CO2 and we

1264
00:51:47,559 --> 00:51:51,839
looked at the CO2

1265
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:53,318
effect just to get an idea of of yeah

1266
00:51:51,838 --> 00:51:55,838
what what it looks like what the inter

1267
00:51:53,318 --> 00:51:58,199
intermediate levels uh look like okay so

1268
00:51:55,838 --> 00:51:59,920
s connected to um question about like

1269
00:51:58,199 --> 00:52:01,318
elasticity but um when you saw the

1270
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:03,200
difference between the control and the

1271
00:52:01,318 --> 00:52:05,480
adapted samples do you have an idea of

1272
00:52:03,199 --> 00:52:06,679
like how much was like how much of the

1273
00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:08,440
difference you thought was like due to

1274
00:52:06,679 --> 00:52:09,919
like actual like evolutionary adaptation

1275
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:11,480
and how much was due to the like

1276
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:13,200
acclamation of just being raised in this

1277
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:14,280
environment yeah that's a good question

1278
00:52:13,199 --> 00:52:16,598
it would be great if we could do all the

1279
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:18,960
genetic analysis but we uh we haven't

1280
00:52:16,599 --> 00:52:21,039
done that uh we didn't bring samples

1281
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:23,559
from the field in the the times we we

1282
00:52:21,039 --> 00:52:26,798
went uh but so the reacclimation

1283
00:52:23,559 --> 00:52:28,359
experiment would be one to do to see if

1284
00:52:26,798 --> 00:52:30,159
yeah we can confirm acclamation versus

1285
00:52:28,358 --> 00:52:31,358
adaptation probably easier even than the

1286
00:52:30,159 --> 00:52:33,838
genetics because I don't know how well

1287
00:52:31,358 --> 00:52:35,838
the Gen Genome of prella is known but

1288
00:52:33,838 --> 00:52:37,199
that might be very hard Trace back but

1289
00:52:35,838 --> 00:52:40,400
this is something that would be very

1290
00:52:37,199 --> 00:52:43,000
cool to do to confirm which of the

1291
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:44,440
two let's do one more and then well and

1292
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:48,199
then I also want to say there's the

1293
00:52:44,440 --> 00:52:50,720
student lunch in man 413 just on the

1294
00:52:48,199 --> 00:52:52,639
hall so St you had your hand up couple

1295
00:52:50,719 --> 00:52:55,679
times there let's do that and then close

1296
00:52:52,639 --> 00:52:59,598
it out did you notice like Chang of

1297
00:52:55,679 --> 00:53:02,558
changes in theill as you approach the

1298
00:52:59,599 --> 00:53:04,640
CO2 source as compared to you know more

1299
00:53:02,559 --> 00:53:06,640
of the control population you speak up a

1300
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:08,679
little bit I just I just couldn't hear

1301
00:53:06,639 --> 00:53:10,440
changes in the density of the pill as

1302
00:53:08,679 --> 00:53:13,719
you approach the CO2 short as compared

1303
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:15,519
to the control the density you're

1304
00:53:13,719 --> 00:53:19,159
saying

1305
00:53:15,519 --> 00:53:22,639
