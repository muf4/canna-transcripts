1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:06,160
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,198 --> 00:00:08,410
University so Thank You Margaret for

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:10,330
that wonderful introduction but one

4
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:15,730
moment I kind of almost cried because I

5
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:17,649
was like oh gosh I am going so uh kind

6
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:24,339
of switching gears I guess because like

7
00:00:17,649 --> 00:00:25,899
you mentioned we kind of have that so so

8
00:00:24,339 --> 00:00:30,910
obviously the topics up there at the

9
00:00:25,899 --> 00:00:36,450
moment but um so so basically the Green

10
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:39,969
Revolution the Green Revolution

11
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:42,160
increased yields in the crops that we

12
00:00:39,969 --> 00:00:46,000
eat and it selected down to very few

13
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:49,679
crops globally and one of the the costs

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,988
of taking that focus on a few crops and

15
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:54,789
focusing on yield in particular I mean

16
00:00:52,988 --> 00:00:57,640
there was actually a reduction in the

17
00:00:54,789 --> 00:00:58,869
concentration of the mineral elements

18
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:05,340
that we have in many of the foods that

19
00:00:58,869 --> 00:01:09,629
we eat and a reduction in diversity so

20
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:12,850
with that as well there's an increasing

21
00:01:09,629 --> 00:01:17,099
interest in the nutrition of the food

22
00:01:12,849 --> 00:01:19,239
that we eat as well so understanding

23
00:01:17,099 --> 00:01:21,548
interactions between genetic and

24
00:01:19,239 --> 00:01:23,140
environmental factors is paramount to

25
00:01:21,549 --> 00:01:26,560
understanding nutritional quality of the

26
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:30,609
food that we eat what do I do

27
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:33,969
okay so there are various organizations

28
00:01:30,609 --> 00:01:36,609
that provide information such as the

29
00:01:33,969 --> 00:01:39,819
USDA and the World Health Organization

30
00:01:36,609 --> 00:01:42,099
that will provide information on the

31
00:01:39,819 --> 00:01:43,868
types and die types and diversity of

32
00:01:42,099 --> 00:01:46,859
foods that we should in order to attain

33
00:01:43,868 --> 00:01:50,379
the essential and beneficial elements

34
00:01:46,859 --> 00:01:53,950
that we require in our diet so 22

35
00:01:50,379 --> 00:01:56,739
mineral elements and so these these if

36
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:59,290
we have any reduction in these this

37
00:01:56,739 --> 00:02:00,789
diversity of food we're expected to have

38
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:02,618
a reduction in the amount of mineral

39
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:04,900
elements that we have in our diet as

40
00:02:02,618 --> 00:02:06,459
well which would affect our health so

41
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:08,498
you may be familiar with this and this

42
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:10,598
is from the USDA giving an idea of the

43
00:02:08,498 --> 00:02:12,789
types and the quantities of food that we

44
00:02:10,598 --> 00:02:14,519
should eat in order to get these mineral

45
00:02:12,789 --> 00:02:19,060
elements

46
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:20,980
but as we're aware all around us we

47
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:24,009
don't have to look too far to see that

48
00:02:20,979 --> 00:02:26,769
there are some people that is this too

49
00:02:24,009 --> 00:02:28,659
late maybe a little too late there may

50
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:30,370
be some people that actually don't get

51
00:02:28,659 --> 00:02:33,659
the types of diet they require in order

52
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:38,319
to get these minerals in their diet so

53
00:02:33,659 --> 00:02:41,409
let's look at Baltimore and in Baltimore

54
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:44,759
there's a map here and we can see that

55
00:02:41,409 --> 00:02:48,819
the red here represents food deserts and

56
00:02:44,759 --> 00:02:51,459
at food desert is defined by a lack of

57
00:02:48,819 --> 00:02:54,099
one of these one or more of these three

58
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:56,610
layers here so the first one here is a

59
00:02:54,099 --> 00:02:59,799
physical access to healthy food

60
00:02:56,610 --> 00:03:02,890
affordable healthy food and desire and

61
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:05,080
knowledge to eat healthily so if we were

62
00:03:02,889 --> 00:03:07,899
to have any one of those lacking in the

63
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:10,540
in in the area geographical location

64
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:12,939
that we live in we would have expect we

65
00:03:10,539 --> 00:03:14,590
may expect that there would be the

66
00:03:12,939 --> 00:03:19,810
possibility we'd have a reduction in the

67
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:22,629
healthy food that we can access and the

68
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:24,129
diversity of mineral elements that we

69
00:03:22,629 --> 00:03:26,969
may have in our diet as well and

70
00:03:24,129 --> 00:03:30,549
therefore affecting our health as well

71
00:03:26,969 --> 00:03:35,079
so but that also happens on a global

72
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:39,040
scale as well so here we have a map of

73
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:43,300
the world and this is the incidence of

74
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:47,349
global zinc iron vitamin A and iodine

75
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:50,200
deficiency in the world and just looking

76
00:03:47,349 --> 00:03:52,359
at that very quick brief look at that it

77
00:03:50,199 --> 00:03:55,149
shows you that there are many countries

78
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:59,160
around the world with you know from mild

79
00:03:55,150 --> 00:04:03,939
to alarmingly high incidence of

80
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:06,090
deficiency of these various elements but

81
00:04:03,939 --> 00:04:08,169
more than that

82
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:10,750
considering just these elements here

83
00:04:08,169 --> 00:04:13,000
maybe one or more of these elements

84
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:14,860
about two billion people globally are

85
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,810
expected to be deficient in one or more

86
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:18,660
of these elements

87
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:21,780
so it's a really a really important

88
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:25,400
question here so but it's easy to

89
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:27,388
resolve so here you know just

90
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:29,060
supplementation is one of the easy ways

91
00:04:27,389 --> 00:04:33,350
that we could actually just remove one

92
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:38,370
remove this problem for people so

93
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:40,919
supplementation directly with tablets is

94
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:44,100
iron for example or supplementation to

95
00:04:40,918 --> 00:04:45,779
the plant in fertilizer form we could

96
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:49,470
have foliar feeds and that type of thing

97
00:04:45,779 --> 00:04:54,089
or another way may be fortification or

98
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:57,510
processed foods but we actually argue

99
00:04:54,089 --> 00:05:02,329
that biofortification so that's using

100
00:04:57,509 --> 00:05:05,370
the innate genetics of the plant is a

101
00:05:02,329 --> 00:05:08,870
sustainable and long term method

102
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:11,430
approach to actually providing the right

103
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:14,189
nutrients to people that actually don't

104
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:17,069
have access to the food in the right way

105
00:05:14,189 --> 00:05:19,918
that they should do actual delivery of

106
00:05:17,069 --> 00:05:21,810
nutrients is is potential especially to

107
00:05:19,918 --> 00:05:24,289
those people the marginalized poor

108
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:26,668
that's when we consider people in

109
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:28,710
sub-saharan Africa for example for

110
00:05:26,668 --> 00:05:31,918
places that around the world that

111
00:05:28,709 --> 00:05:33,810
actually don't have as much access to

112
00:05:31,918 --> 00:05:35,069
the mineral elements that they might

113
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:37,709
require for a healthy diet

114
00:05:35,069 --> 00:05:40,079
so the question man is this if we're

115
00:05:37,709 --> 00:05:42,478
going to do that what is it that we need

116
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:47,609
to know in order to address this this

117
00:05:42,478 --> 00:05:50,569
question so from research in plants we

118
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:53,069
become aware that we were aware that

119
00:05:50,569 --> 00:05:55,560
genetics regulates the elements that go

120
00:05:53,069 --> 00:05:57,180
into the plants that we work with in the

121
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:59,189
crops that we work with but we also

122
00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:02,389
aware that one of the other factors of

123
00:05:59,189 --> 00:06:04,860
that is the soil type the soil PH

124
00:06:02,389 --> 00:06:07,529
fertilization and these other factors as

125
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:11,610
well so genetics here we've denoted as

126
00:06:07,529 --> 00:06:13,859
uppercase G and an environment is

127
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:16,410
denoted is uppercase e sound familiar

128
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:18,689
guys I think so yeah but then there's

129
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:21,840
another element to this as well it's the

130
00:06:18,689 --> 00:06:25,709
interaction of the both G by E okay so

131
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:27,989
before people start throwing things okay

132
00:06:25,709 --> 00:06:29,579
so I want to briefly talk about some of

133
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:32,009
the genetics

134
00:06:29,579 --> 00:06:34,649
I'm glad I'm gonna just talk about iron

135
00:06:32,009 --> 00:06:39,569
now so the path of iron through the

136
00:06:34,649 --> 00:06:41,908
plant so I'll do it from this so first

137
00:06:39,569 --> 00:06:44,158
we look in the rhizosphere and here we

138
00:06:41,908 --> 00:06:44,879
can see insoluble iron within the

139
00:06:44,158 --> 00:06:47,879
rhizosphere

140
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:50,310
which is being chelated and then passed

141
00:06:47,879 --> 00:06:52,830
through channels and I've highlighted

142
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:54,418
this one channel here yellow stripe one

143
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:56,908
because we're going to talk about that a

144
00:06:54,418 --> 00:06:58,740
little bit later so from the yellow

145
00:06:56,908 --> 00:07:00,688
stripe one we're gonna take this path

146
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:03,870
that takes through the cellular and

147
00:07:00,689 --> 00:07:06,900
intracellular pathways going past the

148
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:10,530
Kasparian strip and then towards the

149
00:07:06,899 --> 00:07:12,870
xylem and the phloem in the xylem it

150
00:07:10,529 --> 00:07:16,258
will be taken up through the plant and

151
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:18,408
into places such as the leaves and then

152
00:07:16,259 --> 00:07:21,360
in the leaves because we're dealing with

153
00:07:18,408 --> 00:07:23,459
iron now which can be we need it as an

154
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:26,129
essential element but it's also toxic in

155
00:07:23,459 --> 00:07:28,438
high levels what we can do is what it

156
00:07:26,129 --> 00:07:30,930
does is that something like the N ramp

157
00:07:28,439 --> 00:07:32,879
here will actually take that iron that's

158
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:34,918
in too high quantities and actually put

159
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:36,900
that and store it in the vacuoles and

160
00:07:34,918 --> 00:07:38,288
keep it safe from the other functions in

161
00:07:36,899 --> 00:07:41,198
the plant

162
00:07:38,288 --> 00:07:43,658
and then continuing this passage up to

163
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:46,389
the parts of the plant that we eat then

164
00:07:43,658 --> 00:07:49,180
we find that the iron will be in those

165
00:07:46,389 --> 00:07:52,389
areas there so there's this whole

166
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:54,038
process that really we know parts of it

167
00:07:52,389 --> 00:07:56,800
I mean I've just explained it to you

168
00:07:54,038 --> 00:07:59,618
right we know parts of this process but

169
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,939
there's also a lot that we don't know so

170
00:07:59,619 --> 00:08:04,419
that's what we want to talk about today

171
00:08:00,939 --> 00:08:05,919
what don't we know so what is so maybe

172
00:08:04,418 --> 00:08:09,248
let's talk a little bit about the iron

173
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:11,799
ore so the mineral nutrient and trace

174
00:08:09,249 --> 00:08:13,300
element composition of an organism so

175
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:15,249
that's the definition of what an I

176
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:17,169
enemies but it comes from it's like an

177
00:08:15,249 --> 00:08:20,349
intermediate intermediate of two other

178
00:08:17,168 --> 00:08:21,908
terms as well so the first one sorry

179
00:08:20,348 --> 00:08:25,269
where this it seems there was an

180
00:08:21,908 --> 00:08:27,879
incompatibility with computers but so

181
00:08:25,269 --> 00:08:31,959
the MIT metal ohms say that correctly

182
00:08:27,879 --> 00:08:35,408
that's the in got or inorganic metals

183
00:08:31,959 --> 00:08:38,078
within the plants which is smaller than

184
00:08:35,408 --> 00:08:40,718
the Ino and then we have the organic

185
00:08:38,078 --> 00:08:43,658
Loma like weight molecules and inorganic

186
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:46,329
metals and that's the metabolomic maybe

187
00:08:43,658 --> 00:08:48,220
we're more familiar with so then the

188
00:08:46,328 --> 00:08:52,799
iron ohm then is the nutritionally

189
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:56,470
relevant minerals and trace elements so

190
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:58,328
now that we know that so how can we

191
00:08:56,470 --> 00:09:00,370
influence the mechanisms to improve

192
00:08:58,328 --> 00:09:01,750
nutritional quality how is it we can

193
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:03,789
really get in there and understand the

194
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:06,399
genetics in order to make it work for

195
00:09:03,789 --> 00:09:09,189
what we want so the problem is is

196
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:12,360
currently known genes do not explain the

197
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:16,000
whole story of elemental homeostasis so

198
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:18,459
our solution on that our take is we want

199
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,440
to know the complete set how is it we

200
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:22,000
get to know more of what's going on the

201
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:25,470
complete set to give a bigger part of

202
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:31,539
the story and so our method is using

203
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:34,269
Association mapping on 2320 elements

204
00:09:31,539 --> 00:09:38,889
that and these twenty I remember there

205
00:09:34,269 --> 00:09:40,778
was 22 elements to for the that we were

206
00:09:38,889 --> 00:09:42,370
looking at essential elements earlier so

207
00:09:40,778 --> 00:09:45,240
we're looking at 20 of those though on

208
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:48,009
10 diverse environments and for

209
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:49,568
different populations so that's the

210
00:09:48,009 --> 00:09:50,659
complete thing that we're looking at

211
00:09:49,568 --> 00:09:52,309
there

212
00:09:50,659 --> 00:09:55,068
but I'm going to talk to you about just

213
00:09:52,309 --> 00:09:56,809
three of these populations and you may

214
00:09:55,068 --> 00:09:58,939
be looking at this going what on earth

215
00:09:56,809 --> 00:09:59,508
is that so I'm going to just walk you

216
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:03,949
through it

217
00:09:59,509 --> 00:10:04,550
so these squares represent on the

218
00:10:03,948 --> 00:10:06,109
triangle

219
00:10:04,549 --> 00:10:07,849
they represent the genetic diversity

220
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:11,120
that we find in each of these

221
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:12,680
populations so this one over here is

222
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:14,750
probably quite familiar to most of you

223
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:18,649
is the nested association mapping panel

224
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:20,059
and the comments that I have in the

225
00:10:18,649 --> 00:10:22,879
middle are kind of relative to the other

226
00:10:20,059 --> 00:10:24,739
populations so here we have the NAM is

227
00:10:22,879 --> 00:10:28,420
expected to have greater power than

228
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:33,350
maybe the second Bayes diversity panel

229
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:37,429
sorry and then great resolution and less

230
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:40,250
diversity the Mays diversity panel the

231
00:10:37,429 --> 00:10:43,188
second one here is expected to have less

232
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:46,879
power statistical power and greater

233
00:10:43,188 --> 00:10:48,469
resolution and greater diversity now you

234
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:50,930
might be wondering why this square is in

235
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:52,759
the middle here and that's because some

236
00:10:50,929 --> 00:10:55,188
of the recombinant inbred lines that we

237
00:10:52,759 --> 00:10:58,220
find in the NAM are actually also found

238
00:10:55,188 --> 00:11:00,289
in the diversity panel as well and

239
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:03,170
coming to the third population over here

240
00:11:00,289 --> 00:11:05,990
the heterogeneous inbred families we

241
00:11:03,169 --> 00:11:11,419
have the square again and that tells us

242
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:14,419
that these hips are actually created

243
00:11:11,419 --> 00:11:17,240
from the NEM and these hips that we

244
00:11:14,419 --> 00:11:19,009
create nearly isogenic Plains which is a

245
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:23,539
slightly different question than we were

246
00:11:19,009 --> 00:11:24,300
asking for the first two populations so

247
00:11:23,539 --> 00:11:26,639
I'm going to talk

248
00:11:24,299 --> 00:11:30,990
very briefly about the NAM I'll be quick

249
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:35,759
don't honestly twenty-five NAMM founders

250
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:39,000
so of reasonable diversity genetic

251
00:11:35,759 --> 00:11:42,269
diversity these 25 founder lanes were

252
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:47,750
all crossed with b73 they were selves to

253
00:11:42,269 --> 00:11:50,250
the f6 generation and then we have 25

254
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:53,309
recombinant inbred families and within

255
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:56,840
each family we have 200 common inbred

256
00:11:53,309 --> 00:11:59,339
lines a total of 5,000 individuals and

257
00:11:56,840 --> 00:12:03,210
those are would also be found in the

258
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:05,009
diversity panel as well so okay so we're

259
00:12:03,210 --> 00:12:08,879
getting into some of the data now so

260
00:12:05,009 --> 00:12:11,279
working in the Nam so in the Nam

261
00:12:08,879 --> 00:12:14,700
we planted at four different locations

262
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:16,709
quite diverse locations and then in

263
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:20,009
these locations we're looking at

264
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:22,410
elemental accumulation by location so

265
00:12:20,009 --> 00:12:22,710
here I've picked two random elements for

266
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:25,639
you

267
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:30,060
one is manganese and one is molybdenum

268
00:12:25,639 --> 00:12:32,389
now the concentrations at each location

269
00:12:30,059 --> 00:12:35,000
is seen in the box plots

270
00:12:32,389 --> 00:12:37,309
and then below that on the x-axis such

271
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:40,730
as you can see the locations there but

272
00:12:37,309 --> 00:12:43,549
below that again we have the pH the soil

273
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:44,990
pH for each of those locations and just

274
00:12:43,549 --> 00:12:47,929
to try and make life a little bit easier

275
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:51,230
for you I've colored those by the amount

276
00:12:47,929 --> 00:12:54,729
of accumulation of the availability of

277
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:58,850
that element that we would accept expect

278
00:12:54,730 --> 00:13:03,050
with a pH of that value so for example

279
00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:05,540
in North Carolina we have a pH of 4.5 we

280
00:13:03,049 --> 00:13:06,969
would expect for manganese to have a low

281
00:13:05,539 --> 00:13:10,039
availability

282
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:13,940
likewise in North Carolina for

283
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:16,579
molybdenum we would expect to have low a

284
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:19,040
poor availability again once there but

285
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:22,340
what do we see the data that we actually

286
00:13:19,039 --> 00:13:25,819
see is that the concentrations for each

287
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:29,360
of these within the kernel that we're

288
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:31,550
taking here is actually we expect to

289
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:34,879
have poor availability but we don't have

290
00:13:31,549 --> 00:13:37,189
the lowest for the kernel concentration

291
00:13:34,879 --> 00:13:40,279
and likewise for the manganese we don't

292
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:44,360
have the lowest again so that tells us

293
00:13:40,279 --> 00:13:47,000
that you know the concentrations in the

294
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:49,070
kernel are not tracking directly with pH

295
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,409
that we see in the locations that we're

296
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:54,820
looking at so that tells us once again

297
00:13:51,409 --> 00:13:57,500
there's something else at play here so

298
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:59,210
while I get to the point here the point

299
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:01,100
is if we believe it's the genetics

300
00:13:59,210 --> 00:14:04,220
that's at the greater proportion of this

301
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:06,050
list spelling out the story for you so

302
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:09,290
when we look at the heritability broad

303
00:14:06,049 --> 00:14:11,329
sense heritability which is the genetic

304
00:14:09,289 --> 00:14:14,569
contribution to the phenotype that we're

305
00:14:11,330 --> 00:14:16,900
observing when we look at these two at

306
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:19,790
the bottom here manganese and molybdenum

307
00:14:16,899 --> 00:14:22,909
we can see that their heritability is at

308
00:14:19,789 --> 00:14:26,089
0.6 which is a reasonably high

309
00:14:22,909 --> 00:14:28,159
heritability but then let's look over to

310
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:33,129
these other ones here and we find that

311
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:35,329
we have some others here 0.3 or lower

312
00:14:33,129 --> 00:14:36,919
heritability which just tells us that

313
00:14:35,330 --> 00:14:38,450
actually there's probably a greater

314
00:14:36,919 --> 00:14:41,569
influence of the environment on that

315
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:42,890
phenotype as well so let's take that

316
00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:47,050
point home there so we're talking about

317
00:14:42,889 --> 00:14:51,500
the G and the E and the G by E together

318
00:14:47,049 --> 00:14:54,500
so the next slide so okay great

319
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:57,440
right okay what's going on here okay so

320
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:59,080
now what I want you to do is I want to

321
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:01,580
just take you on a little journey

322
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:06,470
through the process of preparing the

323
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:08,210
data for Association analysis and so I'm

324
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:09,800
just going to sort of talk briefly about

325
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:11,360
these but get used to these slides

326
00:15:09,799 --> 00:15:12,949
because these slides will be coming up

327
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,120
again and so I don't have to talk

328
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:16,250
through them again I'm just going to

329
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:19,009
give you the same type of thing so here

330
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:22,460
we have the icp-ms so what that stands

331
00:15:19,009 --> 00:15:25,100
for is inductively coupled plasma mass

332
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:28,070
spectrometry and what that is is it will

333
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:29,990
actually record the concentration of the

334
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:32,330
the element that we're looking at and

335
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:33,889
give us some raw data and tell us how

336
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:36,860
much of that is actually in the plant

337
00:15:33,889 --> 00:15:41,509
and then for that we sampled for the

338
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:44,029
NAMM roughly 50,000 seeds then here we

339
00:15:41,509 --> 00:15:47,269
remove out laid out layers using the

340
00:15:44,029 --> 00:15:50,269
median absolute deviation 2.5 standard

341
00:15:47,269 --> 00:15:53,179
deviations from the medium and then here

342
00:15:50,269 --> 00:15:55,809
we do it box-cox transformation and then

343
00:15:53,179 --> 00:15:58,639
here we do the best linear unbiased

344
00:15:55,809 --> 00:16:00,709
predictors and that's basically to

345
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:03,049
correct for errors in the data that we

346
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:06,590
get for each lane and we did those for

347
00:16:03,049 --> 00:16:08,719
element 4 Elaine ok so then we moved on

348
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:10,610
from here and we looked at joint linkage

349
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:13,100
which is considered to be a more

350
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:15,820
conservative method of doing this

351
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:18,730
analysis and then below that we did

352
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:21,620
Association mapping genome-wide

353
00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:24,529
Association study and then for

354
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:26,299
resolution within the genome we did 28

355
00:16:24,529 --> 00:16:30,289
approximately 29 million

356
00:16:26,299 --> 00:16:31,909
snips so here I put QTL like rain

357
00:16:30,289 --> 00:16:34,309
because literally that's what it's going

358
00:16:31,909 --> 00:16:36,649
to be like we get so many QTL they're

359
00:16:34,309 --> 00:16:38,449
bursting out of your ears and you so

360
00:16:36,649 --> 00:16:40,250
that's where filtering comes in it's

361
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:43,370
really important to get the correct

362
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:46,039
significance of the threshold for

363
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:49,820
filtering allows us to filter between

364
00:16:46,039 --> 00:16:53,959
the Soniya QTL the good ones and the

365
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:55,970
thunderous QTL the bad ones and so so

366
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:57,440
that we process that and take that data

367
00:16:55,970 --> 00:16:59,570
and then so let's have a look at some of

368
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:04,950
that data

369
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:06,029
so for our joint linkage results and I'm

370
00:17:04,950 --> 00:17:08,400
not going to bore you with too many

371
00:17:06,029 --> 00:17:11,039
details here but what we have here is

372
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:13,140
individual locations so north North

373
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:15,509
Carolina New York Kota Rico and Florida

374
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:17,580
and then these ones would be a QTL

375
00:17:15,509 --> 00:17:20,670
that's found in multiple locations so

376
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:22,980
two or more locations and then right at

377
00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:25,230
the bottom here we have I have so this

378
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:26,549
is a subset of all of the 20/20 that we

379
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:29,279
were looking at but this is all of them

380
00:17:26,549 --> 00:17:31,500
added together we find that the numbers

381
00:17:29,279 --> 00:17:33,329
that we get for individual locations of

382
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:36,539
far higher than the numbers we get for

383
00:17:33,329 --> 00:17:39,210
multiple locations and that also plays

384
00:17:36,539 --> 00:17:42,599
into the whole G by E ideas well idea as

385
00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:44,910
well that actually some QTL they don't

386
00:17:42,599 --> 00:17:47,009
explain everything across every location

387
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:48,900
it's just some things only explain

388
00:17:47,009 --> 00:17:52,230
submit specific things within one

389
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:54,420
location and let's look at the G was as

390
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:56,940
well and this is you know you know how I

391
00:17:54,420 --> 00:18:00,000
said he was more liberal so we're

392
00:17:56,940 --> 00:18:02,820
getting thousands here but then look at

393
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,839
two or more locations twenty-nine so

394
00:18:02,819 --> 00:18:07,169
that makes you feel a little deflated

395
00:18:03,839 --> 00:18:08,699
after that right anyway so so that's the

396
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:11,340
results that we get for the joint

397
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:14,100
linkage and the G was let's have a look

398
00:18:11,339 --> 00:18:16,289
at them a little bit as well so what we

399
00:18:14,099 --> 00:18:18,619
have now is this is the joint linkage

400
00:18:16,289 --> 00:18:20,879
and G was hits for manganese and

401
00:18:18,619 --> 00:18:22,229
everything is overlapping now so

402
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:25,080
everything's but we had all these

403
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:27,210
thousands of QTL but now what we have is

404
00:18:25,079 --> 00:18:29,579
not just thousands but they're all

405
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:31,200
stacking up upon one in Egypt one in one

406
00:18:29,579 --> 00:18:32,490
another so they actually starting to

407
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:35,730
make sense a little bit they're telling

408
00:18:32,490 --> 00:18:40,680
us a story and so this is for manganese

409
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:42,630
and this one's for molybdenum and you

410
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:45,060
know we were getting so many thousands

411
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:46,320
of QTL that we were like well what are

412
00:18:45,059 --> 00:18:49,649
we going to do with this how are we

413
00:18:46,319 --> 00:18:51,419
going to sort of tell a story so our the

414
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:53,790
PIO that we were working with eivin

415
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:55,500
baxter so his lab actually felt a good

416
00:18:53,789 --> 00:18:58,319
thing strategy to do would be to create

417
00:18:55,500 --> 00:19:00,390
some software so this is zebras that

418
00:18:58,319 --> 00:19:02,579
we're looking at now and it's a browser

419
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:06,390
that you can use to actually visualize

420
00:19:02,579 --> 00:19:09,299
many of these QTL anyway so the next one

421
00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:11,009
is phosphorus and you see how they're

422
00:19:09,299 --> 00:19:12,579
nicely stacking up nicely there so we

423
00:19:11,009 --> 00:19:14,829
can actually really sort of look down

424
00:19:12,579 --> 00:19:19,028
the region of the chromosome that's of

425
00:19:14,829 --> 00:19:20,500
interest so let's have a look at some of

426
00:19:19,028 --> 00:19:23,079
the genes that are under some of these

427
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:24,819
stacks so we have just a random

428
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:27,099
selection here so phosphorous manganese

429
00:19:24,819 --> 00:19:29,528
and molybdenum on chromosomes 9 and at 1

430
00:19:27,099 --> 00:19:33,069
and here once again so we have the

431
00:19:29,528 --> 00:19:35,829
sulfate transporter and then what was I

432
00:19:33,069 --> 00:19:37,960
was telling about earlier the N ramp so

433
00:19:35,829 --> 00:19:41,259
here we found the N ramp so we know this

434
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:43,720
story already and then we have the MOT 1

435
00:19:41,259 --> 00:19:46,599
so the reason I'm pulling these ones out

436
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:48,548
for you is because we know these stories

437
00:19:46,599 --> 00:19:50,079
already so I can say to you oh well you

438
00:19:48,548 --> 00:19:52,599
know we've got what we expected but

439
00:19:50,079 --> 00:19:55,569
actually there's a lot we don't know as

440
00:19:52,599 --> 00:19:58,178
well so many of these thousands of QTL

441
00:19:55,569 --> 00:20:00,939
that we got they tell other stories that

442
00:19:58,179 --> 00:20:03,880
maybe we didn't expect at all yeah so

443
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:06,009
there's more stories to tell but I want

444
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:10,870
to talk about this one here a little bit

445
00:20:06,009 --> 00:20:13,990
first so Mott 1 now Mara 1 is one of our

446
00:20:10,869 --> 00:20:15,849
favorites because it was originally

447
00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:17,980
found in Arab topsis in the

448
00:20:15,849 --> 00:20:20,439
mitochondrial envelope and that was by

449
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:20,798
my the PI so you know I got a lucky I

450
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:24,909
guess

451
00:20:20,798 --> 00:20:27,609
I even Baxter and but also it was

452
00:20:24,909 --> 00:20:30,610
discovered by Josh Cobb as well so in

453
00:20:27,609 --> 00:20:32,319
from the Micucci lab in 2013 and then

454
00:20:30,609 --> 00:20:35,038
the reason that we like it is because

455
00:20:32,319 --> 00:20:38,349
not one is a key regulator of molybdenum

456
00:20:35,038 --> 00:20:40,919
in the genome and it explains about 32

457
00:20:38,349 --> 00:20:46,418
percent seventy percent of the variants

458
00:20:40,919 --> 00:20:48,669
so successful detection of Mar 1 is used

459
00:20:46,419 --> 00:20:53,288
as a quality check for the G was that we

460
00:20:48,669 --> 00:20:55,480
do and because it's so almost a

461
00:20:53,288 --> 00:20:57,730
qualitative gene that we're able to

462
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:59,740
release if we don't see that gene

463
00:20:57,730 --> 00:21:04,599
showing up in our results then we start

464
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:06,339
to worry so now that we've looked at the

465
00:21:04,599 --> 00:21:07,538
NAMM we need to think a little bit what

466
00:21:06,339 --> 00:21:11,138
what do we learn from this

467
00:21:07,538 --> 00:21:13,538
so we've looked what adaptations do it

468
00:21:11,138 --> 00:21:16,089
needed to improve analysis so it's

469
00:21:13,538 --> 00:21:18,490
necessary to increase we've learned that

470
00:21:16,089 --> 00:21:20,769
it's necessary to increase statistical

471
00:21:18,490 --> 00:21:23,589
power you know in our association

472
00:21:20,769 --> 00:21:25,798
analyses and then also to increase the

473
00:21:23,589 --> 00:21:28,658
resolution as well

474
00:21:25,798 --> 00:21:30,849
so look familiar so we're back here

475
00:21:28,659 --> 00:21:33,909
again yeah so now let's look at the Mays

476
00:21:30,849 --> 00:21:35,619
diversity panel and that's this big one

477
00:21:33,909 --> 00:21:39,278
in the middle here so we're expecting to

478
00:21:35,619 --> 00:21:42,939
have less power great resolution and

479
00:21:39,278 --> 00:21:45,579
great diversity so we planted these in

480
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:48,879
Florida Indiana Missouri New York North

481
00:21:45,579 --> 00:21:50,710
Carolina and Puerto Rico and that was

482
00:21:48,878 --> 00:21:52,209
performed we're talking about increasing

483
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:55,690
our resolution that was performed on

484
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:58,600
approximately 83 million snips well

485
00:21:55,690 --> 00:22:01,210
before filtration and then we

486
00:21:58,599 --> 00:22:03,699
implemented a multi locus mixed model

487
00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:08,610
and that was in order to reduce false

488
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:08,610
discovery and increase power as well

489
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:14,940
okay so we're back to this again and

490
00:22:12,210 --> 00:22:20,308
we're looking at the concentrations at

491
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:24,120
locations of iron and molybdenum here

492
00:22:20,308 --> 00:22:27,288
are all our locations and then the green

493
00:22:24,119 --> 00:22:33,000
here is where we would expect to see a

494
00:22:27,288 --> 00:22:34,710
good availability of I am but when we

495
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,058
look up here we can clearly see that

496
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:39,298
we're not getting that in fact it's the

497
00:22:36,058 --> 00:22:42,960
lowest of all of them when we look here

498
00:22:39,298 --> 00:22:45,269
for North Carolina again at 4.5 okay

499
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:47,190
it's maybe one of the lowest but what

500
00:22:45,269 --> 00:22:48,690
about explain for Florida as well

501
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:51,058
because that's one of the lowest as well

502
00:22:48,690 --> 00:22:55,558
so clearly something else is going on

503
00:22:51,058 --> 00:22:58,889
here oh sorry so when we look at the

504
00:22:55,558 --> 00:23:01,889
genetic contribution to the phenotypes

505
00:22:58,890 --> 00:23:06,179
that we observe we see that in North

506
00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:09,740
Carolina New York and Indiana for iron

507
00:23:06,179 --> 00:23:11,700
and molybdenum within locations

508
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:14,609
consistently we're getting higher

509
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:16,769
results for the genetic contribution but

510
00:23:14,609 --> 00:23:19,949
then when we look across locations we're

511
00:23:16,769 --> 00:23:24,240
finding that it drops suddenly we have

512
00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:26,130
like so so the heritability is easy to

513
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:28,109
explain within locations but actually

514
00:23:26,130 --> 00:23:30,150
when we look across locations we

515
00:23:28,109 --> 00:23:32,219
actually find that does less it's not as

516
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:36,990
good as explaining the phenotypes that

517
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:38,669
we have so we're back to this again so

518
00:23:36,990 --> 00:23:40,710
that we've done that earlier so now

519
00:23:38,669 --> 00:23:42,419
while we're using here we went from

520
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:45,090
blurps and now we're using residuals

521
00:23:42,419 --> 00:23:46,970
because he was it was a allowing us to

522
00:23:45,089 --> 00:23:49,619
have better normalization of the data

523
00:23:46,970 --> 00:23:51,659
but up the top here so we're going to

524
00:23:49,619 --> 00:23:55,500
talk about this these in a moment at the

525
00:23:51,659 --> 00:23:56,850
top here we implemented a I don't quite

526
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:58,650
know how to say this because it's kind

527
00:23:56,849 --> 00:24:00,359
of an odd thing to say I'm gonna call it

528
00:23:58,650 --> 00:24:04,169
cage here just because I was advised to

529
00:24:00,359 --> 00:24:06,689
say that so it's basically an adjustment

530
00:24:04,169 --> 00:24:09,659
for population structure and that was

531
00:24:06,690 --> 00:24:12,240
implemented by Alex Lipka who's now

532
00:24:09,659 --> 00:24:16,350
University Illinois whose alumni from

533
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:18,599
Cornell and so we implemented the MLM

534
00:24:16,349 --> 00:24:21,480
using the cage here population structure

535
00:24:18,599 --> 00:24:21,869
adjustment and then we did that in just

536
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:24,839
stray

537
00:24:21,869 --> 00:24:28,859
mmm and then also in bootstraps of the

538
00:24:24,839 --> 00:24:31,409
phenotypes we expects the bootstraps to

539
00:24:28,859 --> 00:24:35,308
be more liberal and the do the regular G

540
00:24:31,410 --> 00:24:37,470
was to be more stringent so here we have

541
00:24:35,308 --> 00:24:40,500
QTL again and we're doing liberal and

542
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:44,130
conservative filtering all those I'm

543
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:47,220
sorry and we and we did that on the 83

544
00:24:44,130 --> 00:24:50,220
million snips as well okay so let's look

545
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:52,529
at some of the data so once again what

546
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:55,319
do we get so this is for the bootstraps

547
00:24:52,529 --> 00:24:58,230
over here then individual locations

548
00:24:55,319 --> 00:25:00,659
through here and then looking just at

549
00:24:58,230 --> 00:25:02,849
the individual locations where the two

550
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:05,308
or more of those are observed in more

551
00:25:02,849 --> 00:25:08,069
than one - I'm sorry two or more of

552
00:25:05,308 --> 00:25:11,399
those are observed in each of the

553
00:25:08,069 --> 00:25:13,829
individual locations and so for cadmium

554
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:15,570
phosphorus and zinc we have these

555
00:25:13,829 --> 00:25:18,899
numbers but then looking at the total

556
00:25:15,569 --> 00:25:21,450
numbers across with it for all of the

557
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:24,420
elements we were getting these really

558
00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:29,429
big numbers again but then we have 19

559
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:31,710
across all locations so well that that

560
00:25:29,429 --> 00:25:33,780
tells us then that we're getting the

561
00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:37,650
same case again as we did previously in

562
00:25:33,779 --> 00:25:39,210
the Nam but so we wanted to really look

563
00:25:37,650 --> 00:25:42,420
and say well how many did we get in the

564
00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:44,819
Nam and how many did we get in the

565
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:48,150
diversity panel that different so what

566
00:25:44,819 --> 00:25:51,000
we have here is on the y-axis we have

567
00:25:48,150 --> 00:25:52,920
all of the traits lined up there on the

568
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:55,799
x-axis we're looking at the numbers of

569
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:57,870
cutie ELLs and then the red is the

570
00:25:55,799 --> 00:26:01,470
diversity panel numbers of David but

571
00:25:57,869 --> 00:26:04,289
diversity panel QTL and then the blue

572
00:26:01,470 --> 00:26:07,769
ones are common to Nam and the diversity

573
00:26:04,289 --> 00:26:11,490
panel and look how ridiculously small it

574
00:26:07,769 --> 00:26:13,440
is yeah so the point is but that's kind

575
00:26:11,490 --> 00:26:15,240
of what we expected you know we're

576
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:16,710
looking at different populations we're

577
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:19,740
looking at different allelic diversity

578
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:21,360
x' we're looking at in a way that we

579
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:24,359
kind of should have expected that yeah

580
00:26:21,359 --> 00:26:28,079
and so because we're looking at these

581
00:26:24,359 --> 00:26:30,869
different the broader genetic diversity

582
00:26:28,079 --> 00:26:33,359
we're actually mining a broader set of

583
00:26:30,869 --> 00:26:33,869
lines that we hadn't actually looked at

584
00:26:33,359 --> 00:26:37,619
in the

585
00:26:33,869 --> 00:26:39,538
so in a way this is it's actually

586
00:26:37,619 --> 00:26:43,649
confirms what we'd thought in the first

587
00:26:39,538 --> 00:26:45,690
place so let's look at some of these

588
00:26:43,650 --> 00:26:48,778
genes again under these Peaks that we

589
00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:51,240
were looking at and we have iron cadmium

590
00:26:48,778 --> 00:26:53,220
manganese and molybdenum and then

591
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:55,109
remember way back in the beginning when

592
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:57,240
I was talking about yellow striped one

593
00:26:55,109 --> 00:26:58,819
when it goes into the roots here again

594
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:02,250
we have yellow striped one its

595
00:26:58,819 --> 00:27:04,349
associated with iron but we have these

596
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:06,690
other ones that may be less you know

597
00:27:04,349 --> 00:27:09,148
expected but cute in biosynthesis

598
00:27:06,690 --> 00:27:11,640
associated with cadmium but we can

599
00:27:09,148 --> 00:27:13,739
explain these away zinc transporter

600
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:16,409
associated with manganese may be less

601
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:18,990
expected and then once again our best

602
00:27:16,409 --> 00:27:23,700
friend what one has shown up again so

603
00:27:18,990 --> 00:27:25,579
but look at this no no no three three of

604
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:28,500
those are actually not found in the NAM

605
00:27:25,579 --> 00:27:30,298
but you know a friend here a qualitative

606
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:32,880
friend over here is actually found in

607
00:27:30,298 --> 00:27:34,500
the NAMM as well so we're asking we're

608
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:36,059
finding that actually we're not finding

609
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:37,470
them in the dough we're not finding them

610
00:27:36,058 --> 00:27:41,460
in them we're actually finding them in

611
00:27:37,470 --> 00:27:43,620
the diversity panel as well so the great

612
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:48,538
thing with zebras is that it allows us

613
00:27:43,619 --> 00:27:50,759
to really drill deep into the zoom into

614
00:27:48,538 --> 00:27:54,028
the areas where we can actually see the

615
00:27:50,759 --> 00:27:57,599
genes so these are this is a peak of

616
00:27:54,028 --> 00:28:02,150
different snips here QTL and here's a

617
00:27:57,599 --> 00:28:04,429
gene that it possibly is associated

618
00:28:02,150 --> 00:28:06,019
and then also one for manganese and we

619
00:28:04,430 --> 00:28:08,029
have this nice stack just sitting

620
00:28:06,019 --> 00:28:10,240
directly on top of this gene here as

621
00:28:08,029 --> 00:28:10,240
well

622
00:28:10,759 --> 00:28:16,259
okay so I want to move on to the next

623
00:28:14,039 --> 00:28:18,750
population now and this is the last one

624
00:28:16,259 --> 00:28:22,558
so don't panic so we're looking at the

625
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:24,420
hips and before that I'm going to just

626
00:28:22,558 --> 00:28:27,779
sort of explain briefly how it is that

627
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:29,550
we created so this probably looks

628
00:28:27,779 --> 00:28:32,670
familiar this is the NAMM recombinant

629
00:28:29,549 --> 00:28:36,089
inbred lines and then from those by

630
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:38,630
design we have a residual 3% hetero

631
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:43,500
zygosity point the Cross Lanes

632
00:28:38,630 --> 00:28:46,170
now looking at QTL that we got from the

633
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:48,150
NEM we were able to then say okay so

634
00:28:46,170 --> 00:28:50,070
we're looking within this QTL we want to

635
00:28:48,150 --> 00:28:52,650
actually find some hetero zygosity

636
00:28:50,069 --> 00:28:55,139
that's actually sits within that locus

637
00:28:52,650 --> 00:28:58,320
and so what we did is that we looked

638
00:28:55,140 --> 00:29:01,830
within a locus and then we're able to

639
00:28:58,319 --> 00:29:03,659
detect heterozygous regions then we

640
00:29:01,829 --> 00:29:06,449
select that one line that takes that

641
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:09,509
there has that region and then we plant

642
00:29:06,450 --> 00:29:13,580
it out well we sell fit then plant it

643
00:29:09,509 --> 00:29:16,259
out and then then we'll look do GBS

644
00:29:13,579 --> 00:29:17,699
genotyping by sequencing on each of

645
00:29:16,259 --> 00:29:22,079
these lanes and we're able to then to

646
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:25,259
select homem homozygotes for that region

647
00:29:22,079 --> 00:29:28,169
so here we have two and seven just

648
00:29:25,259 --> 00:29:29,700
random numbers that I picked you that

649
00:29:28,170 --> 00:29:35,490
will actually allow us to find

650
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:38,640
homozygous opposing alleles so we take

651
00:29:35,490 --> 00:29:39,870
those two and seven up here and then we

652
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:43,110
can see that they're different at that

653
00:29:39,869 --> 00:29:45,509
low site and then we bulk those out and

654
00:29:43,109 --> 00:29:48,058
then disseminate them to the locations

655
00:29:45,509 --> 00:29:50,490
that we're working at and here are some

656
00:29:48,058 --> 00:29:53,279
of the interesting phenotypes that we

657
00:29:50,490 --> 00:29:56,400
observed in musgraves if anybody's

658
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:58,139
familiar with my screen so there might

659
00:29:56,400 --> 00:30:00,240
be expected because of the interesting

660
00:29:58,140 --> 00:30:02,280
phenotypes associated with the elements

661
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:05,440
that we're dealing with

662
00:30:02,279 --> 00:30:07,869
okay so what do we do with these hips

663
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:09,880
now so we planted them in Florida

664
00:30:07,869 --> 00:30:12,569
Indiana Missouri New York Texas two

665
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:15,820
locations in simit and Puerto Rico and

666
00:30:12,569 --> 00:30:19,269
the purpose of this we expect that the

667
00:30:15,819 --> 00:30:23,649
hips will reduce the genetic variants

668
00:30:19,269 --> 00:30:25,210
that we see between lanes also we

669
00:30:23,650 --> 00:30:27,190
believe that it will increase the

670
00:30:25,210 --> 00:30:31,240
heritability of the traits that we're

671
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:33,730
working with and then also the use of we

672
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:35,859
use that name based QTL for selection of

673
00:30:33,730 --> 00:30:37,839
the hips like it explained already but

674
00:30:35,859 --> 00:30:43,659
then also in order in each of these

675
00:30:37,839 --> 00:30:45,849
locations we have areas of differences

676
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:47,558
between the lanes so we really wanted to

677
00:30:45,849 --> 00:30:50,259
dig down into a greater resolution

678
00:30:47,558 --> 00:30:55,450
within that so for their reason we you

679
00:30:50,259 --> 00:30:58,869
also used haplotype blocks as well so

680
00:30:55,450 --> 00:31:00,819
this is kind of a zoom in of all of the

681
00:30:58,869 --> 00:31:03,879
lines so this is a subset that you see

682
00:31:00,819 --> 00:31:05,919
here so this is the haplotype blocks

683
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:08,770
that we're looking at here and each of

684
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:12,070
these red lines that you see represent a

685
00:31:08,769 --> 00:31:14,650
haplotype block across the genome these

686
00:31:12,069 --> 00:31:17,349
are the chromosomes and then each of

687
00:31:14,650 --> 00:31:20,160
these boxes represents a QTL that we got

688
00:31:17,349 --> 00:31:23,169
from them when we did the UNAM analysis

689
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:25,920
now the one that we want to look at

690
00:31:23,170 --> 00:31:29,380
right now just as an example for you is

691
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:32,470
a cadmium QTL that we use to select

692
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:35,679
lanes and so that's highlighted there in

693
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:38,799
that section so we really felt that the

694
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:40,809
the the epitope lock analysis will allow

695
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:43,210
us to get greater resolution within the

696
00:31:40,808 --> 00:31:48,879
qtls that we're looking at for our

697
00:31:43,210 --> 00:31:50,500
selected lines excuse me so once again

698
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:53,080
we go through this process of preparing

699
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:55,720
the phenotype data but working now with

700
00:31:53,079 --> 00:31:58,210
two point two point nine million snips

701
00:31:55,720 --> 00:32:01,329
for the genotype and then now we're

702
00:31:58,210 --> 00:32:03,819
going to run a G was on blocks the

703
00:32:01,329 --> 00:32:06,339
hepatitis and then also G was on the

704
00:32:03,819 --> 00:32:08,409
individual snips as well now we're

705
00:32:06,339 --> 00:32:10,869
getting the QTL and then we're going to

706
00:32:08,410 --> 00:32:15,940
be using the in the intersection of

707
00:32:10,869 --> 00:32:21,239
those QTL in order to find it

708
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:26,558
QTL of high interest a significant QTL

709
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:29,769
so this is for cadmium now and on the

710
00:32:26,558 --> 00:32:32,589
Left excuse me on the Left we have a QTL

711
00:32:29,769 --> 00:32:37,710
that is four blocks and then on the

712
00:32:32,589 --> 00:32:37,709
right we have a snip based qtls as well

713
00:32:38,849 --> 00:32:45,878
so so basically we're looking for the

714
00:32:42,369 --> 00:32:49,479
intersection of both of these so here

715
00:32:45,878 --> 00:32:52,058
using zebras once again we're able to

716
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:54,308
align all of these intersecting QTL we

717
00:32:52,058 --> 00:32:58,898
go from the blocks and the snips and

718
00:32:54,308 --> 00:33:01,359
Yuri have this one very clear peak so

719
00:32:58,898 --> 00:33:04,329
when we zoom in on that peak we find two

720
00:33:01,359 --> 00:33:07,538
sub regions so one is it a hundred and

721
00:33:04,329 --> 00:33:09,759
sixty mega bases and the other is at one

722
00:33:07,538 --> 00:33:11,138
hundred and seventy six mega bases so we

723
00:33:09,759 --> 00:33:16,720
really wanted to know more about the

724
00:33:11,138 --> 00:33:19,628
details of this region so we did a

725
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:21,548
cholesterol analysis on this and here we

726
00:33:19,628 --> 00:33:23,019
can see that we have three close

727
00:33:21,548 --> 00:33:26,168
clusters so we had a trimodal

728
00:33:23,019 --> 00:33:29,138
distribution of concentrations now for

729
00:33:26,169 --> 00:33:32,350
cluster one over here the green one we

730
00:33:29,138 --> 00:33:35,859
found that we had a mean concentration

731
00:33:32,349 --> 00:33:38,519
of cadmium for those alleles of four

732
00:33:35,859 --> 00:33:41,829
point eighty two milligrams a kilogram

733
00:33:38,519 --> 00:33:44,048
so cluster two that's the black one over

734
00:33:41,829 --> 00:33:45,849
there we had a mean of twenty seven

735
00:33:44,048 --> 00:33:48,519
point seven eight milligrams of kilogram

736
00:33:45,849 --> 00:33:49,778
so there's a difference of 23 milligram

737
00:33:48,519 --> 00:33:53,138
per kilogram there so that's huge

738
00:33:49,778 --> 00:33:54,669
difference so you can see the the box

739
00:33:53,138 --> 00:33:57,599
plots at the bottom here for each of

740
00:33:54,669 --> 00:34:01,929
those clusters so a two and one yeah

741
00:33:57,599 --> 00:34:04,449
so using tests of significance between

742
00:34:01,929 --> 00:34:05,798
these clusters were able to observe that

743
00:34:04,450 --> 00:34:07,600
there is actually a significant

744
00:34:05,798 --> 00:34:10,539
difference between two and one

745
00:34:07,599 --> 00:34:12,489
clusters two and one there there wasn't

746
00:34:10,539 --> 00:34:14,460
a significant difference for cluster

747
00:34:12,489 --> 00:34:17,729
three

748
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:20,809
so running the G was on individual

749
00:34:17,730 --> 00:34:23,159
locations that was able to tell us that

750
00:34:20,809 --> 00:34:25,919
actually we did all of these locations

751
00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:29,220
at the top but we only found those QTL

752
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:31,710
in New York so once again that tells us

753
00:34:29,219 --> 00:34:37,230
that so many of our QTL are highly

754
00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:42,720
specific to specific locations my voice

755
00:34:37,230 --> 00:34:45,389
is going ok so so so that really gives

756
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:50,398
us an idea about the G by E that we're

757
00:34:45,389 --> 00:34:53,119
working with so so what have we learned

758
00:34:50,398 --> 00:34:56,789
we've looked at three populations here

759
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:58,079
so now we've learnt going back to some

760
00:34:56,789 --> 00:35:01,409
of the original questions that we're

761
00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:03,000
asking what about biofortification and

762
00:35:01,409 --> 00:35:04,799
here we're saying is if we really want

763
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:07,469
to do biofortification breeding we

764
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:10,589
really need to understand the G by E and

765
00:35:07,469 --> 00:35:12,480
the application of therefore QTL using

766
00:35:10,588 --> 00:35:15,779
QTL that are applicable to specific

767
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:17,608
locations so G was helps us to

768
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:21,030
understand the big picture of

769
00:35:17,608 --> 00:35:22,949
homeostasis we can gain a knowledge of

770
00:35:21,030 --> 00:35:25,109
the complete set of genes we've done

771
00:35:22,949 --> 00:35:26,759
that if we're seeing things that we're

772
00:35:25,108 --> 00:35:30,469
talking about diversity and we get these

773
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:33,390
QTL that come from that but then also

774
00:35:30,469 --> 00:35:36,088
we're getting location specific QTL

775
00:35:33,389 --> 00:35:38,940
we're getting a lot of them so we

776
00:35:36,088 --> 00:35:40,949
identify QTL for locally for locally

777
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:43,230
adapted lines and then we're also

778
00:35:40,949 --> 00:35:45,989
getting strong we can get strong

779
00:35:43,230 --> 00:35:49,400
multi-location QTL but maybe we could

780
00:35:45,989 --> 00:35:51,989
have more success with those ones so for

781
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:55,920
planting across multiple locations in

782
00:35:51,989 --> 00:35:58,469
different regions so for further

783
00:35:55,920 --> 00:36:00,539
investigation so at the end of this what

784
00:35:58,469 --> 00:36:04,889
do we actually get what's the story that

785
00:36:00,539 --> 00:36:07,079
we can tell for the NAMM out of 19 of 20

786
00:36:04,889 --> 00:36:11,539
of the elements we're getting more than

787
00:36:07,079 --> 00:36:13,760
300 low say for each element and the

788
00:36:11,539 --> 00:36:16,670
that's missing there is selenium sorry

789
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:20,390
Lily

790
00:36:16,670 --> 00:36:23,269
for David the diversity panel we're

791
00:36:20,389 --> 00:36:25,489
getting more than 250 low-side per

792
00:36:23,269 --> 00:36:27,079
element but that's for all elements and

793
00:36:25,489 --> 00:36:30,439
then for the hips

794
00:36:27,079 --> 00:36:34,069
we found the cadmium QTL and a possible

795
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:41,090
modifier there was upstream at 176 mega

796
00:36:34,070 --> 00:36:46,670
bases so with that I'd like to put

797
00:36:41,090 --> 00:36:50,059
things to arrest and I'd like to thank

798
00:36:46,670 --> 00:36:52,460
my committee members and who are they

799
00:36:50,059 --> 00:36:54,139
you may be wondering so that's Margaret

800
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:56,750
Smith

801
00:36:54,139 --> 00:37:02,599
Owen ho kanga and Ronnie's over there

802
00:36:56,750 --> 00:37:05,269
and Lily and sincerely really I might

803
00:37:02,599 --> 00:37:06,079
well up now but since silly for

804
00:37:05,269 --> 00:37:08,630
everything that you've done

805
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:11,989
I really really appreciate oh gosh I am

806
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:14,119
willing it okay anyway and then I just

807
00:37:11,989 --> 00:37:17,000
want to say thank you for the funding

808
00:37:14,119 --> 00:37:19,429
that I've received as well from the

809
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:23,360
plant breeding news section and then uh

810
00:37:19,429 --> 00:37:25,759
I've done it feels like a huge amount of

811
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:29,120
TA I love doing

812
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:32,090
no luck teeing loves me I think but uh

813
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:34,849
so Steve - in molecular biology and

814
00:37:32,090 --> 00:37:38,360
genetics and then also working with

815
00:37:34,849 --> 00:37:42,019
Larry smart and Michael Mazurek and then

816
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:45,590
also research funding from the NSF and

817
00:37:42,019 --> 00:37:48,559
then the top here the our collaborators

818
00:37:45,590 --> 00:37:50,840
Ivan Baxter from and Greg Ziegler the

819
00:37:48,559 --> 00:37:54,170
guy that created zebras I think it's his

820
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:57,410
last name that's from the Danforth

821
00:37:54,170 --> 00:37:59,119
Center and then also Chad Myers and Rob

822
00:37:57,409 --> 00:38:00,619
Schaffer you know there's another

823
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:02,989
project that we I haven't actually

824
00:38:00,619 --> 00:38:06,139
talked to you about and that was called

825
00:38:02,989 --> 00:38:08,979
a co-expression browser the Rob Schaffer

826
00:38:06,139 --> 00:38:11,480
was working on his part of his PhD and

827
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:13,039
what that was a bit so you know you know

828
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:15,199
how we've actually drilled down to the

829
00:38:13,039 --> 00:38:18,409
gene level and we're kind of interested

830
00:38:15,199 --> 00:38:20,329
we'll what's beyond that you know how

831
00:38:18,409 --> 00:38:22,250
does that fit into a genetic pathway

832
00:38:20,329 --> 00:38:24,980
what's the moleculus of mechanisms

833
00:38:22,250 --> 00:38:26,750
behind that and really as things are

834
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:29,210
as as we look at them at the moment

835
00:38:26,750 --> 00:38:31,159
we're an unable to do that we can we can

836
00:38:29,210 --> 00:38:32,510
guess but we really want to sort of

837
00:38:31,159 --> 00:38:34,219
drill down even further into

838
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:37,160
understanding so that's something that

839
00:38:34,219 --> 00:38:40,009
Rob was working on but in the timeline

840
00:38:37,159 --> 00:38:42,618
that I had in order to finish didn't

841
00:38:40,010 --> 00:38:45,710
work out so anyway so we also want to

842
00:38:42,619 --> 00:38:47,869
thank people for germplasm

843
00:38:45,710 --> 00:38:51,320
and plant the planting locations that we

844
00:38:47,869 --> 00:38:54,559
used so in Texas South Murray Natalia

845
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:57,380
Palacios in and Aldo Rizal is in CIMMYT

846
00:38:54,559 --> 00:38:58,639
Jeff Gaston in Florida Jerry Flynn

847
00:38:57,380 --> 00:39:03,530
Garcia in Missouri

848
00:38:58,639 --> 00:39:06,650
and then here at home Cornell University

849
00:39:03,530 --> 00:39:09,560
sherry Norman Keith Payne and then dan

850
00:39:06,650 --> 00:39:12,289
Fisher on the corner a corn project also

851
00:39:09,559 --> 00:39:13,730
want to thank Deniz academia as time was

852
00:39:12,289 --> 00:39:15,349
running out towards the end it was like

853
00:39:13,730 --> 00:39:16,909
I've got to do this I need some help

854
00:39:15,349 --> 00:39:20,509
so here's Elbert to help me from

855
00:39:16,909 --> 00:39:26,569
statistical consultancy unit but most

856
00:39:20,510 --> 00:39:29,980
but not least where are they oh gosh I'd

857
00:39:26,570 --> 00:39:32,990
like to thank my beautiful wife and my

858
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:35,240
beautiful daughters they're actually

859
00:39:32,989 --> 00:39:56,599
sitting at the back here today can you

860
00:39:35,239 --> 00:39:59,569
stand up so my wife she's okay anyway I

861
00:39:56,599 --> 00:40:05,170
didn't think I'd be so emotional so with

862
00:39:59,570 --> 00:40:05,170
that I'd like to any questions

863
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:12,619
[Applause]

864
00:40:21,559 --> 00:40:27,719
[Music]

865
00:40:30,289 --> 00:40:33,360
[Music]

866
00:40:38,760 --> 00:41:12,030
that was a huge advantage and then also

867
00:40:42,000 --> 00:41:14,010
thanks to comments yes nitty-gritty but

868
00:41:12,030 --> 00:41:15,990
what are the exact right ear to deciding

869
00:41:14,010 --> 00:41:19,349
whether to yuki-onna the same velocity

870
00:41:15,989 --> 00:41:21,059
location right um yes sorry I always

871
00:41:19,349 --> 00:41:22,830
meant to say that so thank you thanks

872
00:41:21,059 --> 00:41:24,599
you for raising that up so basically

873
00:41:22,829 --> 00:41:27,900
when we were looking at the NAMM the

874
00:41:24,599 --> 00:41:31,920
diversity panel very often we didn't

875
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:34,230
have snip-snip exactness so so basically

876
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:36,420
what we did is we created a 2 KB window

877
00:41:34,230 --> 00:41:38,280
either side of the locus that we were

878
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:40,280
looking at and anything that fell within

879
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:43,589
that we considered it to be the same

880
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:45,690
assuming that you know looking at Jason

881
00:41:43,588 --> 00:41:49,049
Wallace's recent paper looking at now

882
00:41:45,690 --> 00:41:52,559
within a 20 KB window upstream and or 10

883
00:41:49,050 --> 00:41:56,119
KB upstream and downstream we felt that

884
00:41:52,559 --> 00:41:56,119
would be a reason to be conservative

885
00:42:19,219 --> 00:42:27,118
right yeah right so at the money to look

886
00:42:25,079 --> 00:42:28,079
at but I mean based on our

887
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:30,720
multi-location

888
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:32,489
QTL here at the moment it's big it's all

889
00:42:30,719 --> 00:42:35,669
it is is that the QTL that we can

890
00:42:32,489 --> 00:42:37,319
actually find and detect within one

891
00:42:35,670 --> 00:42:39,150
location in another location if they

892
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:41,070
exact hits that we can call them the

893
00:42:39,150 --> 00:42:44,240
same thing well that's something we'll

894
00:42:41,070 --> 00:42:44,240
need to look into at some point

895
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:54,048
you're busting to ask me questions yes I

896
00:42:50,048 --> 00:42:57,048
you sort of just a partition is genetic

897
00:42:54,048 --> 00:43:02,630
and environmental sort of the factor G

898
00:42:57,048 --> 00:43:08,690
Cressy because you also say that nature

899
00:43:02,630 --> 00:43:17,059
nurture phylogeny ontogeny you want to

900
00:43:08,690 --> 00:43:18,470
talk to me later I suppose you could say

901
00:43:17,059 --> 00:43:20,630
that maybe yeah

902
00:43:18,469 --> 00:43:22,909
g'bye yeah nature nurture that might be

903
00:43:20,630 --> 00:43:25,329
a way of putting it yes so the nature

904
00:43:22,909 --> 00:43:27,710
would be you know what's the genetics

905
00:43:25,329 --> 00:43:29,329
and then the nurture would be the

906
00:43:27,710 --> 00:43:33,139
environment that you grown up so

907
00:43:29,329 --> 00:43:52,548
basically that's exactly right that help

908
00:43:33,139 --> 00:43:54,529
thank you okay yes kernels so so

909
00:43:52,548 --> 00:43:57,469
regarding your last question the sample

910
00:43:54,530 --> 00:43:59,119
size so that's not something that was

911
00:43:57,469 --> 00:44:00,949
actually involved in that was something

912
00:43:59,119 --> 00:44:02,119
that Greg was do Greg Ziegler was doing

913
00:44:00,949 --> 00:44:05,029
in the Danville Center

914
00:44:02,119 --> 00:44:54,818
I believe that they took something that

915
00:44:05,030 --> 00:44:57,819
was a happy medium I might be good

916
00:44:54,818 --> 00:44:57,818
actually

917
00:45:10,208 --> 00:45:20,088
we're about out of time but thank you

918
00:45:12,438 --> 00:45:23,118
for coming thank you this has been a
