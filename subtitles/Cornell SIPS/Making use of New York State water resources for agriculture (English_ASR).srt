1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:04,280
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:12,160
University um so my background is in

3
00:00:10,199 --> 00:00:14,199
hydrology so this talk is mostly

4
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,559
hydrology with some kind of agronomy and

5
00:00:14,199 --> 00:00:17,559
agriculture thrown in just so you kind

6
00:00:15,558 --> 00:00:19,160
of know what perspective I'm coming from

7
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:21,198
um in terms of the project I've been

8
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:23,198
working on this um with a a grad student

9
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:25,560
Sher Martin who's here and then also Dr

10
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:27,880
tresa selfa who's at Sunni ESF um she's

11
00:00:25,559 --> 00:00:29,759
a rural sociologist all three of us are

12
00:00:27,879 --> 00:00:30,640
actually uh have at least one cornal

13
00:00:29,759 --> 00:00:33,799
degree

14
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,799
um so I guess it's a good

15
00:00:34,479 --> 00:00:39,359
pedigree so in terms of just some

16
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:42,359
background on the project um so this is

17
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:44,799
um funded by USDA um so two years ago

18
00:00:42,359 --> 00:00:47,399
almost they had a um a new program come

19
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:49,479
out the water for agriculture challenge

20
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:51,320
um sort of the context of it was 2013

21
00:00:49,479 --> 00:00:52,599
2014 um and clearly a lot of the

22
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:54,359
motivation was because of the drought

23
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:56,120
out west uh so when I was sort of

24
00:00:54,359 --> 00:00:58,160
contemplating is there anything to

25
00:00:56,119 --> 00:00:59,320
propose it's can you really come up with

26
00:00:58,159 --> 00:01:01,839
anything as compelling as what's going

27
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:03,079
on out west so one question that kind of

28
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,799
occurred to me and I think have occurred

29
00:01:03,079 --> 00:01:07,400
to other people is what is the potential

30
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:09,720
if it's if it's harder to sustain

31
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:11,320
agricultur out west to shift agriculture

32
00:01:09,719 --> 00:01:14,118
back East right and that seems like a

33
00:01:11,319 --> 00:01:16,319
reasonable question to ask um with the

34
00:01:14,118 --> 00:01:19,079
idea of the intended impact of the water

35
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:20,719
for agriculture challenge is to ensure

36
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:22,759
um quantity and availability of Water

37
00:01:20,719 --> 00:01:24,438
Supplies so if you want more water out

38
00:01:22,759 --> 00:01:26,640
west why don't you take your agriculture

39
00:01:24,438 --> 00:01:28,798
somewhere where you actually have

40
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:31,560
water but then a few other questions

41
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:33,600
arise with that so one thing so I was

42
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:35,719
just looking at some papers um this this

43
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:37,959
is more of a climatology paper um

44
00:01:35,719 --> 00:01:40,679
looking at Water Supply in the west so

45
00:01:37,959 --> 00:01:42,599
this is just someone mapping out uh

46
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:44,920
Reservoir storage um in the Colorado

47
00:01:42,599 --> 00:01:47,599
River Basin so basically storage in the

48
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:49,399
um Lake power Lake me so that's the

49
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:51,759
black line so they're tracking that from

50
00:01:49,399 --> 00:01:54,399
2005 to 20 um or that's the green line

51
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:56,039
so from 2005 to 2014 but at the same

52
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:57,640
time what they also did is they also

53
00:01:56,039 --> 00:01:59,200
looked at groundwater and the way it

54
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:00,959
looked at groundwater is they used um

55
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,880
what's called Gra the grace program from

56
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:04,359
NASA which is the satellite program and

57
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:07,399
it looks at small changes in the

58
00:02:04,359 --> 00:02:09,239
gravimetric field um of the earth and

59
00:02:07,399 --> 00:02:11,000
what they can do is they can detect um

60
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:13,520
at a regional scale changes in

61
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,400
groundwater storage so interesting thing

62
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:18,640
with this graph is they basically saw

63
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:21,360
2010 2011 people are concerned that Lake

64
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:22,759
me might go dry it basically recovers

65
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,360
but what they continue to see is they

66
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:28,759
see ground rouer levels go down and stay

67
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:30,360
down so this kind of suggests a few sort

68
00:02:28,759 --> 00:02:33,799
of interesting things really to my

69
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:36,920
project and also Western

70
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:38,439
water which is one is that the drought

71
00:02:36,919 --> 00:02:41,000
has probably to some degree impacted

72
00:02:38,439 --> 00:02:43,158
Western Water Production um but to the

73
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,519
other degree it's it's Western

74
00:02:43,158 --> 00:02:46,000
production of Agriculture is to some

75
00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:48,560
degree probably been mitigated by

76
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,560
Reliance on groundwater um so if we sort

77
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,479
of look at 10 20 years out when that

78
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,039
groundwater isn't there will there be a

79
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:56,158
more obvious need for shifting things

80
00:02:54,039 --> 00:02:57,919
somewhere else the third thing that it

81
00:02:56,158 --> 00:03:00,318
does in terms of some perspective for

82
00:02:57,919 --> 00:03:02,559
thinking about New York is it is it

83
00:03:00,318 --> 00:03:04,199
highlights the fact that even out west

84
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,598
where there's these irrigation districts

85
00:03:04,199 --> 00:03:08,560
and well-known basically is a a definite

86
00:03:06,598 --> 00:03:10,359
need for managing water there's been

87
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,120
gaps in terms of understanding and

88
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:13,959
management and that big gap has been in

89
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:15,039
groundwater so people have been drawing

90
00:03:13,959 --> 00:03:16,799
down groundwater basically because

91
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:20,280
there's no regulations there to manage

92
00:03:16,799 --> 00:03:22,280
it that basic parallels New York um in

93
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:24,199
the sense of in New York it's sort of

94
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:26,158
been free rain in terms of nonpotable

95
00:03:24,199 --> 00:03:27,639
water use um in turn and I'll talk about

96
00:03:26,158 --> 00:03:29,759
this in a few minutes until only about

97
00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:31,719
three years ago there were basically no

98
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:33,359
restrictions in most of New York not in

99
00:03:31,719 --> 00:03:35,199
the sasan River Basin Delaware River

100
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,159
Basin but everywhere else if you were a

101
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:38,719
non-potable water user so a golf course

102
00:03:37,158 --> 00:03:40,318
a farmer you basically could take as

103
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:42,280
much water as you wanted never had to

104
00:03:40,318 --> 00:03:44,479
report it and never had to tell anyone

105
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:46,120
so to some degree New York is sort of in

106
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:47,919
the place where the West has been with

107
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:49,719
groundwater is we really don't know very

108
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:52,158
much right so this is sort of the

109
00:03:49,719 --> 00:03:56,199
motivated the two questions of of this

110
00:03:52,158 --> 00:03:59,039
work is um can we shift agriculture back

111
00:03:56,199 --> 00:04:00,959
East um if we do that and we do we need

112
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:02,359
water to do that that um have we

113
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:04,280
basically been using more water for

114
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:07,239
agriculture than we think in in the East

115
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:08,560
and in New York um and what do we

116
00:04:07,239 --> 00:04:10,280
actually know about how much water use

117
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,360
there's been right so those are those

118
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:14,680
are sort of the overriding

119
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:15,840
questions okay so basically four things

120
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:18,160
we'll look at sort of four different

121
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,798
parts of the talk um first one is more

122
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,000
antidotal but is there less water than

123
00:04:19,798 --> 00:04:23,239
we think in New York and we'll do a

124
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,759
little case study on Fall Creek um

125
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:26,319
second one is how much do we actually

126
00:04:24,759 --> 00:04:28,759
know about agricultural water demand in

127
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:30,639
New York um third is what sources of

128
00:04:28,759 --> 00:04:31,800
water could agriculture make use of

129
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:33,079
right we're very different than the west

130
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:34,720
where they have snow pack they have

131
00:04:33,079 --> 00:04:36,439
large reservoirs they've been planning

132
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:39,080
for irrigation basically since the

133
00:04:36,439 --> 00:04:40,600
beginning of of saddling L West um and

134
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:43,359
then the fourth one is can we actually

135
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:45,680
demonstrate a benefit of

136
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:48,000
irrigation okay so place to start is

137
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:50,199
just thinking about um sort of a case

138
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,720
study of what do we know about um water

139
00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:55,360
use um in New York so we're going to

140
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:58,160
look at Fall Creek um one reason it's

141
00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:00,280
nearby um another reason it's a good

142
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:02,160
size right it's the water shed at least

143
00:05:00,279 --> 00:05:03,879
above the gauge is about 125 square

144
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,680
miles so big enough to actually have

145
00:05:03,879 --> 00:05:07,918
some water to do something with but

146
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:10,840
small enough to get a grasp on so this

147
00:05:07,918 --> 00:05:13,799
is our map so we're right here well yeah

148
00:05:10,839 --> 00:05:16,399
we literally are right here right um the

149
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:18,439
gauge so one nice thing about this um

150
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:19,918
Watershed is it's actually gauged most

151
00:05:18,439 --> 00:05:22,560
gauges in New York are either on New

152
00:05:19,918 --> 00:05:24,240
York City water supply watersheds or big

153
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,680
Rivers so this is actually a relatively

154
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:28,160
small watered that's gauged um and then

155
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:30,199
it has some interesting things going on

156
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:32,080
in terms of water use

157
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:34,960
so there's the Cornell Water Filtration

158
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:36,599
plant um did most people know Cornell

159
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:39,879
has their own Water Filtration plant we

160
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:42,240
do um then there's several places where

161
00:05:39,879 --> 00:05:44,918
they pull water out for irrigation um

162
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,840
all related to Cornell so in Varna um

163
00:05:44,918 --> 00:05:47,879
they have some irrigation sometimes and

164
00:05:46,839 --> 00:05:50,198
then there's the Homer Thompson

165
00:05:47,879 --> 00:05:51,399
vegetable farm out in Freeville um and

166
00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:54,319
then the other thing that's interesting

167
00:05:51,399 --> 00:05:55,918
too is there's discharge of water um

168
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:57,479
from dried and Freeville wastewater

169
00:05:55,918 --> 00:05:59,560
treatment plant so that's actually

170
00:05:57,478 --> 00:06:00,800
inflow to the system and for the most

171
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:02,680
part of that water we could kind of

172
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,199
consider consider it an outof base and

173
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:05,800
transfer in the sense that it's

174
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:08,800
basically groundwater from homeowner

175
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:10,840
Wells um or from deeper groundwater it

176
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,160
might be in the The Basin but it's

177
00:06:10,839 --> 00:06:14,159
basically deep groundwater it's not

178
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:18,520
surface

179
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:20,680
water okay so then we can basically say

180
00:06:18,519 --> 00:06:22,318
um can we do sort of some water

181
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:26,079
accounting for for what we have

182
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:27,240
available um so as I said it's really

183
00:06:26,079 --> 00:06:28,758
only been in the last few years that

184
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:31,079
anyone's really bothered to pay too much

185
00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:33,960
attention um to what's what's available

186
00:06:31,079 --> 00:06:36,359
so basy Cornell as far as I know has

187
00:06:33,959 --> 00:06:37,839
really only done a um made an attempt to

188
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:40,120
sort of compile the records for the last

189
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:42,399
four years um so going back to about

190
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:44,840
2011 luckily though we've had some

191
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:47,439
really dry years in there so 2011 and

192
00:06:44,839 --> 00:06:50,119
2012 um basally approach uh the

193
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:51,519
historical lows um in this summer um so

194
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:53,240
the historical low is determined by

195
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:56,399
going back the USGS gauge goes back to

196
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:58,400
1925 so basically picking off the the

197
00:06:56,399 --> 00:07:02,000
monthly minimum um all the way back to

198
00:06:58,399 --> 00:07:03,719
1925 so 2011 and 2012 come pretty close

199
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,879
to those monthly minimums right so we

200
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:07,560
can get a good sense of demand when

201
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:09,759
you're actually at your minimum in terms

202
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:11,598
of of moisture

203
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:12,800
availability okay so let's look at some

204
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:15,759
of the

205
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,560
demands um so cornal a withdrawals basy

206
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:19,160
for

207
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:21,038
irrigation we can see sort of what we

208
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:23,080
might expect but often this date isn't

209
00:07:21,038 --> 00:07:25,719
available is that when it's drier in

210
00:07:23,079 --> 00:07:28,399
2011 and 2012 you use more water and you

211
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:29,800
use about four times more water um the

212
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:31,519
thing to look at here and kind of put

213
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:34,120
this all together in a minute so

214
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:36,799
everything is in MGD anyone know what

215
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:38,959
MGD is some people probably not a lot of

216
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:42,560
people so it's in million gallons per

217
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:44,478
day um so that's in water supply that's

218
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:48,759
a pretty typical measure is to use

219
00:07:44,478 --> 00:07:50,639
million gallons per day okay um okay so

220
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:52,759
that's around 0.1 million gallons per

221
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:55,240
day um in terms of Maximum irrigation

222
00:07:52,759 --> 00:07:57,560
demand this is monthly

223
00:07:55,240 --> 00:08:00,960
average this is the coronal Filtration

224
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:03,158
plant so they use quite a bit more um

225
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:04,719
they use between 1 and a half and 2

226
00:08:03,158 --> 00:08:07,000
million gallons per day of water and

227
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:08,039
that's pretty consistent um as we've

228
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,839
been doing this we've been learning some

229
00:08:08,038 --> 00:08:11,318
interesting things about who uses water

230
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:14,439
and and how they use it so the golf

231
00:08:11,319 --> 00:08:16,720
course actually uses filtered water from

232
00:08:14,439 --> 00:08:18,598
the Water Filtration plant whereas most

233
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:20,199
other places well irrigation on campus

234
00:08:18,598 --> 00:08:22,959
just uses unfiltered water but we are

235
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:25,280
sort of surprised to find

236
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:27,959
that okay so putting these numbers

237
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:30,559
together um so the one thing to realize

238
00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:33,278
is the withdraw and the the gains to the

239
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:34,759
system are all um Upstream of the gauge

240
00:08:33,278 --> 00:08:37,080
so the gauge is basically not telling

241
00:08:34,759 --> 00:08:38,439
you what's available um before you take

242
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:40,158
anything out it's basically telling you

243
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:42,360
what's available after you take things

244
00:08:40,158 --> 00:08:44,158
out so it sort of is a good it's a

245
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:46,800
relatively good indication of the lowest

246
00:08:44,158 --> 00:08:49,519
available flow um so if we basically

247
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:52,039
look at um fil Filtration plant um

248
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:53,799
subtracting off um cornal irrigation

249
00:08:52,039 --> 00:08:56,278
subtracting water and then dried in

250
00:08:53,799 --> 00:09:01,078
Freeville adding some water um and

251
00:08:56,278 --> 00:09:03,559
comparing that to um 196 4 um this is

252
00:09:01,078 --> 00:09:05,639
the 1964 minimum assuming the gains and

253
00:09:03,559 --> 00:09:07,479
losses are the same as they are now

254
00:09:05,639 --> 00:09:10,078
which we're not quite sure if they are

255
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:12,519
um this would be September 1964

256
00:09:10,078 --> 00:09:14,559
including these current gains and losses

257
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:17,959
so we basically it seems like if we look

258
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:19,799
at historical minimums drought of record

259
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:23,399
um we would always have some amount of

260
00:09:19,799 --> 00:09:26,039
flow in Fall Creek but 2.7 million

261
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:27,759
gallons per day isn't much flow does

262
00:09:26,039 --> 00:09:29,919
anyone know probably what it's flowing

263
00:09:27,759 --> 00:09:31,838
at right now Fall Creek

264
00:09:29,919 --> 00:09:33,278
want to put a number out there I like to

265
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:36,360
do this with my classes I like to ask

266
00:09:33,278 --> 00:09:38,120
people make some guesses it's probably

267
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:40,000
about um I didn't look at the gauge it's

268
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:41,639
probably around somewhere around 100 MGD

269
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,399
right now and in the summer when you go

270
00:09:41,639 --> 00:09:45,720
out there and you think it's pretty dry

271
00:09:43,399 --> 00:09:48,639
it's probably around 20 MGD so if you

272
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:50,399
say 2 MGD we still have water that's not

273
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:54,319
a lot of water that's like that's

274
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:56,879
basically a trickle of water um so main

275
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:58,760
point is right if we look at this we do

276
00:09:56,879 --> 00:10:00,159
still have some water but not a lot

277
00:09:58,759 --> 00:10:02,319
right so we can basically say within the

278
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:03,519
historical record drawing some water of

279
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:05,000
the system we're basically getting to a

280
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:06,759
point where if you take much more water

281
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,639
of the system you have nothing left

282
00:10:06,759 --> 00:10:10,559
right and people haven't really as far

283
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:12,000
we've talked to um Chris bour who runs

284
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:13,958
the wastewater treatment plant it's

285
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,278
interesting they have a number for what

286
00:10:13,958 --> 00:10:17,559
their um maximum withdrawal can be but

287
00:10:16,278 --> 00:10:20,000
it's actually based on their plant

288
00:10:17,559 --> 00:10:21,518
capacity it's not based on hydrology

289
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,480
right so no one is really out there

290
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:25,360
looking to say are there minimums that

291
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:28,440
we have to meet

292
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:30,680
um the other thing too is that these are

293
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:33,120
all based on monthly

294
00:10:30,679 --> 00:10:34,759
averages right so we know within a month

295
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:37,000
there's going to be variability but then

296
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:38,720
within a day there's variability um so

297
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,720
if you go and look at the USGS gauge

298
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:43,240
record um and this is this is

299
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:46,639
instantaneous flow it's every 15 minutes

300
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:47,720
you see this cycling like this and we've

301
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:49,560
actually been trying to figure this out

302
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:51,800
for a while what this is because it's

303
00:10:49,559 --> 00:10:54,039
this only shows up in the last few years

304
00:10:51,799 --> 00:10:55,759
um and what we realized is Cornell

305
00:10:54,039 --> 00:10:57,480
change the way they operate their plant

306
00:10:55,759 --> 00:11:01,000
so now they turn it off at night for a

307
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:03,360
few hours but what this does is if your

308
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:06,120
daily demand is to MGD but you turn it

309
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:08,360
off for half the time that means your

310
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:11,039
your demand when it's on is for MGD

311
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:12,560
right so and if the if say if the

312
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:13,879
irrigation works the same way if they

313
00:11:12,559 --> 00:11:15,599
only turn on certain times of the day

314
00:11:13,879 --> 00:11:17,799
turn off certain times of the day your

315
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,278
monthly mean you might be meeting what

316
00:11:17,799 --> 00:11:20,679
you have available but you could

317
00:11:19,278 --> 00:11:23,159
certainly be at a point during the day

318
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:24,519
where you actually dry things out right

319
00:11:23,159 --> 00:11:27,278
um where your instantaneous demands

320
00:11:24,519 --> 00:11:28,639
exceed what you have so it seems pretty

321
00:11:27,278 --> 00:11:30,679
reasonable just based on this sort of

322
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:32,320
this case study that there definitely

323
00:11:30,679 --> 00:11:34,278
can be places one of them being Fall

324
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,399
Creek in the state where if people

325
00:11:34,278 --> 00:11:37,600
aren't really looking at how we're

326
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:40,320
withdrawing water um that we could

327
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:42,399
potentially run out of

328
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:44,600
water um one thing to note to this and

329
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:46,000
as we go on a little farther is the way

330
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:48,040
this operates is it's what we would call

331
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,679
run-of the river system right so out

332
00:11:48,039 --> 00:11:51,078
west or places like that ideally what

333
00:11:49,679 --> 00:11:53,439
you have it's not run-of the river you

334
00:11:51,078 --> 00:11:54,599
have a reservoir some storage to draw

335
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,000
but here we're basically just taking

336
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:58,240
whatever Waters in the system is what

337
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,759
we're taking out um as we talk about

338
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,560
other potential sources in New York

339
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:03,600
state for for irrigation and water

340
00:12:01,559 --> 00:12:05,078
demand what we want to look for is

341
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,920
places where it's not run-of the river

342
00:12:05,078 --> 00:12:08,559
where you actually have storage if you

343
00:12:06,919 --> 00:12:10,240
think about New York though we don't

344
00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:12,039
necessarily have a lot of storage we

345
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:13,440
have some we have the Great Lakes we

346
00:12:12,039 --> 00:12:14,759
have the Finger Lakes but they're not

347
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,440
necessarily at an ideal point to make

348
00:12:14,759 --> 00:12:17,919
use of them but we'll see a little later

349
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:20,560
on where we might actually have a source

350
00:12:17,919 --> 00:12:24,559
that people don't always think

351
00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:27,319
about okay so kind of part two of this

352
00:12:24,559 --> 00:12:29,359
is to ask the question um besides just

353
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:31,720
this case study what else do we know

354
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:34,000
about Irrigation in New York state right

355
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:35,800
um are there any numbers out there so

356
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,399
there's basically two entities that sort

357
00:12:35,799 --> 00:12:39,319
of make an attempt to put some numbers

358
00:12:37,399 --> 00:12:41,000
together um there's USDA so they have

359
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:42,399
their agricultural census every five

360
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,120
years and they ask some questions about

361
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:46,679
irrigation they basically ask about

362
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:49,679
irrigated acreage and then there's USGS

363
00:12:46,679 --> 00:12:52,278
us Geological Survey um that also every

364
00:12:49,679 --> 00:12:55,439
five years comes out with estimates of

365
00:12:52,278 --> 00:12:57,439
water use on a county basis um so these

366
00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:00,000
numbers official government Publications

367
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:02,120
they're out there it's by County it

368
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,759
seems like it might be reasonable to

369
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:07,519
trust it um so let's look at some of

370
00:13:04,759 --> 00:13:08,720
these uh so I think might be a little

371
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:11,000
small but you can probably kind of see

372
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:12,800
it from the back um depending how young

373
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:17,839
you are or old you

374
00:13:12,799 --> 00:13:20,000
are um so first three columns USDA Nas

375
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:22,160
um National a statistical service data

376
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,958
so that's irrigated Acres um and then

377
00:13:22,159 --> 00:13:27,000
the last colum is USGS demand um in

378
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:29,479
terms of MGD right so comparing kind of

379
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:32,039
apples and oranges one is Acres one is

380
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:33,360
actual demand um just some interesting

381
00:13:32,039 --> 00:13:35,559
interesting things to pick out so

382
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:37,399
Gennesse County um and I'll I'll show a

383
00:13:35,559 --> 00:13:39,399
map in a second well I'll actually go do

384
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:41,360
it right now um so if you don't know

385
00:13:39,399 --> 00:13:42,440
your your New York State um geography

386
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:44,519
and you're wondering where these places

387
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:47,000
are so basically places with most

388
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:48,679
irrigation basically from nas Orleans

389
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,440
genese and Wyoming counties those are

390
00:13:48,679 --> 00:13:53,039
sort of the three highest ones stacked

391
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:55,759
up right there um and then Wayne County

392
00:13:53,039 --> 00:13:56,879
and Niagara County probably sources or

393
00:13:55,759 --> 00:13:58,480
what they're irrigating is a little

394
00:13:56,879 --> 00:14:00,919
different Wayne and Niagara County

395
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,278
probably predominantly Orchards um well

396
00:14:00,919 --> 00:14:03,919
known right that's where most the Apple

397
00:14:02,278 --> 00:14:05,879
production is in the state um and then

398
00:14:03,919 --> 00:14:07,679
Orleans Gennesse and Wyoming Orleans and

399
00:14:05,879 --> 00:14:09,679
Gennesse probably more vegetable

400
00:14:07,679 --> 00:14:11,879
production Wyoming I actually don't

401
00:14:09,679 --> 00:14:13,359
quite know I think it's mostly crops but

402
00:14:11,879 --> 00:14:16,278
that's sort of part of the Gap I don't

403
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,278
don't quite know what that

404
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:22,440
is um okay so then our other source is

405
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:25,639
thinking about USGS demand how

406
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:27,839
consistent is this um the interesting

407
00:14:25,639 --> 00:14:30,720
thing about the USGS demand is it

408
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:32,519
doesn't exact correlate to the acreage

409
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:35,079
right the highest one for USGS demand

410
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:37,360
does correspond to genese County um but

411
00:14:35,078 --> 00:14:39,319
you have other counties with relatively

412
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:41,759
low acreage um that still have

413
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:44,079
relatively High USGS demand numbers

414
00:14:41,759 --> 00:14:46,399
right if we go do just some back of the

415
00:14:44,078 --> 00:14:49,559
envelope calculations so I basically

416
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:51,039
just took MGD converted to cubic meters

417
00:14:49,559 --> 00:14:54,078
per year something a little easier to

418
00:14:51,039 --> 00:14:56,120
think about maybe um and then kind of

419
00:14:54,078 --> 00:14:58,239
look at a few possible irrigation rates

420
00:14:56,120 --> 00:15:00,278
so basically centimeters per year and

421
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:02,240
look at how how many acres irrigated

422
00:15:00,278 --> 00:15:04,600
would one MGD give you so now we can

423
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:08,799
kind of do a comparison between acres

424
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:10,480
and MGD so irrigation rate it seems like

425
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:12,120
10 centimeters per year is probably the

426
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,519
high end in New York state it' be hard

427
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:15,159
to believe you have a year that's much

428
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:17,440
drier you need more than 10 cenm per

429
00:15:15,159 --> 00:15:20,439
year during grow growing season so that

430
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:23,000
would say um 10 centimeter per year um

431
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:27,240
irrigation rate could you could irrigate

432
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:29,240
uh almost 3500 Acres with one MGD right

433
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:32,000
so that would in gene County if the

434
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:34,120
numbers are right from USGS 5 5 MGD at

435
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:37,039
10 cm per year would give you 17,000

436
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:38,919
Acres um what NASA is reporting is 6,000

437
00:15:37,039 --> 00:15:40,799
Acres seems like a pretty big

438
00:15:38,919 --> 00:15:42,000
inconsistency right and and that's even

439
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:43,318
going to be true especially when you

440
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,839
look at some of these smaller counties

441
00:15:43,318 --> 00:15:50,198
with less acreage like Erie County 3.36

442
00:15:46,839 --> 00:15:52,839
MGD 390 Acres there's a pretty big

443
00:15:50,198 --> 00:15:54,758
inconsistency there so clearly

444
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:57,440
something's missing that we don't know

445
00:15:54,759 --> 00:15:59,720
um not surprisingly though USGS does

446
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:01,040
this for every count in the country and

447
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:02,920
if you look at the report there's about

448
00:16:01,039 --> 00:16:04,838
five people on the report so however

449
00:16:02,919 --> 00:16:07,838
they do this it's some way where they

450
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:07,839
really crank through it

451
00:16:09,318 --> 00:16:13,958
so okay but this basically raises more

452
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:16,199
questions than it answers right it

453
00:16:13,958 --> 00:16:17,719
basically says doesn't tell you anything

454
00:16:16,198 --> 00:16:19,159
about how often is irrigation occurring

455
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:20,959
if we trust the nas data which I think

456
00:16:19,159 --> 00:16:22,439
is pretty reliable it basically just

457
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:24,439
tells us it's irrigated it tells us

458
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:26,440
nothing about actual demand it doesn't

459
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:27,519
tell us how much water is being used it

460
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:29,839
doesn't tell us where the water is

461
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:32,480
coming from um and then there's this

462
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:35,600
inconsistency pointed

463
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:37,240
out okay so as I've sort of alluded to

464
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:39,079
there's more data becoming available and

465
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:41,318
it basically is coming from um the

466
00:16:39,078 --> 00:16:43,758
nework or the the Great Lakes compact

467
00:16:41,318 --> 00:16:46,198
which was passed or at least discussed

468
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:49,278
and agreed to be passed back in 2008 um

469
00:16:46,198 --> 00:16:52,240
and a basy agreement between um States

470
00:16:49,278 --> 00:16:54,278
and um provinces in Canada um about how

471
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:55,480
to manage their water and New York State

472
00:16:54,278 --> 00:16:57,318
as part of that said they would actually

473
00:16:55,480 --> 00:17:00,639
start to try to track water usage

474
00:16:57,318 --> 00:17:02,958
non-potable water usage um so in 2011

475
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:05,120
people who used over 100,000 gallons per

476
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:06,480
day of non-potable water use had to

477
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:08,479
basically start telling the state that

478
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:10,679
they're using the water it's basically

479
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:13,880
voluntary in the sense that the state

480
00:17:10,679 --> 00:17:15,280
doesn't know if you don't report so but

481
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:18,520
what it does is it starts to give us a

482
00:17:15,279 --> 00:17:22,000
data source okay so what this is is this

483
00:17:18,519 --> 00:17:24,918
is um for the most part people reporting

484
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:27,119
um to DC who's collecting that data um

485
00:17:24,919 --> 00:17:29,440
and this is we we geore referenced at

486
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:32,079
least the the address associated with

487
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:33,480
the the user which might not literally

488
00:17:32,079 --> 00:17:35,480
be where it's taken from but we're doing

489
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:37,839
the best we can um and then this is

490
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:39,360
overlaid over a crop map of different

491
00:17:37,839 --> 00:17:41,558
types of crops in New York state right

492
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:44,558
so the yellow is corn the darker green

493
00:17:41,558 --> 00:17:46,200
is soybean um the pink is alala and you

494
00:17:44,558 --> 00:17:48,440
can kind of see the darker red is

495
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:50,080
usually some cases it's apples and some

496
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:52,160
cases it's dry beans and things like

497
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:54,399
that but it starts to give you a pretty

498
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:56,759
good sense of sort of some distribution

499
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:59,000
of things in New York state the other

500
00:17:56,759 --> 00:18:01,240
thing we have added in here is and I'll

501
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,279
start to talk about this in a minute is

502
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:04,798
the Barge Canal Authority also provides

503
00:18:03,279 --> 00:18:06,678
water to people and if you take water

504
00:18:04,798 --> 00:18:09,798
from the Barge Canal you have to get a

505
00:18:06,679 --> 00:18:11,759
permit um so we also have the blue dots

506
00:18:09,798 --> 00:18:14,519
are people with a Barge Canal um permit

507
00:18:11,759 --> 00:18:16,079
to draw water okay so if you put this

508
00:18:14,519 --> 00:18:18,480
out there this is sort of our best

509
00:18:16,079 --> 00:18:21,798
picture to date in terms of sort of

510
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:23,798
sight specific users of irrigation water

511
00:18:21,798 --> 00:18:25,079
in New York state right and it basically

512
00:18:23,798 --> 00:18:27,839
matches up with what we knew from the

513
00:18:25,079 --> 00:18:29,839
nas data in terms of people are Center

514
00:18:27,839 --> 00:18:31,158
in Orleans County jese County and

515
00:18:29,839 --> 00:18:33,599
there's actually a few more off the

516
00:18:31,159 --> 00:18:36,559
bottom let's see let's go this way um

517
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:38,839
which get cut off there down in Wyoming

518
00:18:36,558 --> 00:18:42,038
County and for the most part the dots

519
00:18:38,839 --> 00:18:44,119
lie in areas with agriculture which is

520
00:18:42,038 --> 00:18:46,359
good so it seems like it's consistent

521
00:18:44,119 --> 00:18:49,678
with what we're

522
00:18:46,359 --> 00:18:51,918
seeing um so at this point no we still

523
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:53,559
don't really have any idea of of demand

524
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:56,520
um what how much water they're using or

525
00:18:53,558 --> 00:18:56,519
where they're taking water

526
00:18:56,558 --> 00:19:01,960
from one thing we do kind of know is

527
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:03,319
with the dec data at least it does have

528
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:06,400
it does give information about who the

529
00:19:03,319 --> 00:19:07,200
user is um so we can get some sense um

530
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,759
actually there is a little bit of

531
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,440
withdrawal data I forgot with these CD

532
00:19:08,759 --> 00:19:12,158
data there is um so we have some sense

533
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:13,919
of demand and then we have some sense of

534
00:19:12,159 --> 00:19:16,200
what they're producing and for the most

535
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:18,200
part as I guess we might expect it's

536
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:19,720
fruit and apples and vegetables so

537
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:21,840
things that would Horticultural products

538
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:24,360
that would generally be more sensitive

539
00:19:21,839 --> 00:19:24,359
um to water

540
00:19:24,839 --> 00:19:30,839
demand okay so some examples up there

541
00:19:29,159 --> 00:19:32,840
okay so one thing you might notice and I

542
00:19:30,839 --> 00:19:35,038
sort of highlight here is we have a

543
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:37,839
large concentration along the Barge

544
00:19:35,038 --> 00:19:39,839
Canal right anybody from New York State

545
00:19:37,839 --> 00:19:42,639
have most people walked along the Barge

546
00:19:39,839 --> 00:19:44,399
Canal just to get a sense a few people

547
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:47,480
okay a lot of people haven't right so

548
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:50,640
original URI Canal 1825 um basically

549
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:53,159
went from um just outside of Albany over

550
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:54,520
to Buffalo at the time Upstate New York

551
00:19:53,159 --> 00:19:56,559
was mostly Forest land and it

552
00:19:54,519 --> 00:19:58,720
effectively opened up um the Western

553
00:19:56,558 --> 00:20:00,480
frontier at the time right just about

554
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:04,600
every city in New York state in Upstate

555
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:07,038
New York is basally on on a river or on

556
00:20:04,599 --> 00:20:11,519
the Erie Canal what was the Erie Canal

557
00:20:07,038 --> 00:20:13,679
um in about um 1905 or so um the Erie

558
00:20:11,519 --> 00:20:15,720
Canal was 80 years old they decided to

559
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:18,038
update it so they built the Barge Canal

560
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:20,960
in some places it stayed along the same

561
00:20:18,038 --> 00:20:22,720
path but in other places um like in City

562
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:24,319
of Rochester it went around the outside

563
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:26,240
of the city of

564
00:20:24,319 --> 00:20:28,879
Rochester um but you basically have this

565
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:31,558
almost 200y old you know kind of major

566
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:32,840
engineering feat um sitting out there um

567
00:20:31,558 --> 00:20:35,519
interestingly enough so I'll talk more

568
00:20:32,839 --> 00:20:37,199
about it in a minute um I think it they

569
00:20:35,519 --> 00:20:38,558
have a budget of over $100 million a

570
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,798
year I think their revenue is about

571
00:20:38,558 --> 00:20:42,720
$100,000 per year so if you ever wonder

572
00:20:40,798 --> 00:20:43,918
why your taxes are so high or especially

573
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,519
why it cost so much to drive on the

574
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:47,240
throughway you can partially thank the

575
00:20:45,519 --> 00:20:49,839
Eerie Canal

576
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:52,440
so um okay but this is where the Eerie

577
00:20:49,839 --> 00:20:56,399
Canal goes um on that western side of

578
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:58,200
the state um it's basically totally flat

579
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:00,200
um and it drains out of Lake Erie and

580
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:02,279
then here's Orleans County that it cuts

581
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:05,360
across um and then it eventually hits

582
00:21:02,279 --> 00:21:07,079
the genese river over by Rochester um so

583
00:21:05,359 --> 00:21:08,798
basically the reason all that irrigation

584
00:21:07,079 --> 00:21:10,918
is there is because they're taking

585
00:21:08,798 --> 00:21:14,038
advantage of the Barge Canal of pulling

586
00:21:10,919 --> 00:21:15,799
water of the Barge Canal um and it's

587
00:21:14,038 --> 00:21:18,319
basically it

588
00:21:15,798 --> 00:21:20,000
was um so two things I guess so the

589
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:22,240
original Eerie Canal was actually

590
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,079
intentionally built up higher um to

591
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:25,679
avoid flooding when they built the Barge

592
00:21:24,079 --> 00:21:28,599
Canal they built it lower so it actually

593
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:30,320
intersects the genesy river now um which

594
00:21:28,599 --> 00:21:31,839
is a good thing because it basically

595
00:21:30,319 --> 00:21:34,639
means what this is it's basically a

596
00:21:31,839 --> 00:21:36,399
direct conduit from Lake yie um across

597
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:38,320
the state and it also can potentially

598
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:40,080
pull water from the jese river so if you

599
00:21:38,319 --> 00:21:41,278
start to talk about is there a way is

600
00:21:40,079 --> 00:21:43,359
there actually infrastructure in New

601
00:21:41,278 --> 00:21:45,759
York state where we can draw upon stored

602
00:21:43,359 --> 00:21:47,479
water the Barge Canal is it because it's

603
00:21:45,759 --> 00:21:49,079
basically connected to the genesy river

604
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:50,319
and lake yuie and I don't think most

605
00:21:49,079 --> 00:21:52,759
people really look at it that way but

606
00:21:50,319 --> 00:21:54,200
that's really what it is um so part of

607
00:21:52,759 --> 00:21:56,319
this project is basically thinking about

608
00:21:54,200 --> 00:22:00,038
can we other ways to sort of optimize

609
00:21:56,319 --> 00:22:00,038
the use of that infrastructure

610
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:06,558
okay um here's a nice view of things

611
00:22:04,278 --> 00:22:08,240
1905 um probably looks more quaint then

612
00:22:06,558 --> 00:22:09,480
than it does now but I don't I don't

613
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,599
think it looks that bad now either this

614
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:13,240
is

615
00:22:10,599 --> 00:22:15,319
Madina um so this is engineering report

616
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:16,839
from 1905 um which is interesting so

617
00:22:15,319 --> 00:22:19,399
basically when they modified the Barge

618
00:22:16,839 --> 00:22:21,519
Canal from the Eerie Canal um they

619
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:22,960
intentionally recognized so you know

620
00:22:21,519 --> 00:22:24,679
when you open the locks and the canal

621
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:26,200
you basically lose water so you have to

622
00:22:24,679 --> 00:22:30,440
have a you have to have a lot of water

623
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:31,960
coming in um so what realized was um so

624
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:33,278
they intentionally made sure they had a

625
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:36,120
large source of water and here is the

626
00:22:33,278 --> 00:22:38,000
Eerie Canal or the lake Eerie um and

627
00:22:36,119 --> 00:22:39,678
they basically put a number on this so

628
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,119
they say that it has a capacity to

629
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:43,600
provide at least 1237 cubic feet per

630
00:22:42,119 --> 00:22:46,479
second of water in this portion of the

631
00:22:43,599 --> 00:22:48,480
canal um that's a lot of water um in

632
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:51,679
terms of MGD that's about equivalent to

633
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:53,919
about a th000 MGD um so there's a

634
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:56,720
potential to to carry to convey a lot of

635
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:58,080
to supply a lot of water there another

636
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:00,120
question you might ask is okay so if

637
00:22:58,079 --> 00:23:02,199
it's not the Barge Canal um other other

638
00:23:00,119 --> 00:23:04,479
sources of water in the state um there

639
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:06,840
are some aquifers um a lot of those

640
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:08,880
correspond to to glacial Valley bottom

641
00:23:06,839 --> 00:23:10,839
aquifers um for the most part they're

642
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:14,240
not extensively tapped there are some

643
00:23:10,839 --> 00:23:16,000
out there something else to consider um

644
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:18,079
we're we might go there but not

645
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,319
necessarily but just something else to

646
00:23:18,079 --> 00:23:24,759
put out

647
00:23:20,319 --> 00:23:26,639
there okay so despite the fact we know

648
00:23:24,759 --> 00:23:28,558
there's Irrigation in the Northeast and

649
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:31,120
in New York I think the the other

650
00:23:28,558 --> 00:23:33,240
question that's out there is is it

651
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:34,959
scientifically is it defensible is it

652
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:36,759
necessarily is it necessary right we

653
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:39,000
know people are doing it so it seems

654
00:23:36,759 --> 00:23:41,200
like it must have some value um but is

655
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:43,200
there other evidence out there of what

656
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:45,960
the value actually

657
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:47,400
is so and I so surprisingly there's

658
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:48,600
really not that much information right I

659
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:50,120
mean there's a lot of farmers that kind

660
00:23:48,599 --> 00:23:52,278
of say I think we need to do this and

661
00:23:50,119 --> 00:23:54,199
they they're doing it um but at the same

662
00:23:52,278 --> 00:23:57,200
time if you start to look for actual

663
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:58,880
scientific studies that show um the need

664
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,759
for it um there's not that there's

665
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:02,720
really not many out there at all so the

666
00:24:00,759 --> 00:24:05,038
one thing that complicates things I

667
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:06,640
think as most kind of aromy people know

668
00:24:05,038 --> 00:24:07,798
and especially in the Northeast is you

669
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:09,960
have lots of different factors

670
00:24:07,798 --> 00:24:11,918
controlling yield um right so I kind of

671
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:13,600
at the top here I just picked corn just

672
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:15,600
because it was a nice image I could find

673
00:24:13,599 --> 00:24:17,278
it easily right but at the top I sort of

674
00:24:15,599 --> 00:24:19,359
have different factors that can affect

675
00:24:17,278 --> 00:24:21,319
yield so clearly in the Northeast early

676
00:24:19,359 --> 00:24:22,519
season wetness is a big one how soon can

677
00:24:21,319 --> 00:24:24,798
we actually get in the field and plant

678
00:24:22,519 --> 00:24:26,960
things um once things actually start

679
00:24:24,798 --> 00:24:29,158
growing is it actually warm enough for

680
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:31,200
the crop um so do we accumulate enough

681
00:24:29,159 --> 00:24:33,480
Growing Degree Days um once things are

682
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:36,080
growing do we have rain we don't want so

683
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:38,519
do we flood our field um do things are

684
00:24:36,079 --> 00:24:40,000
things too wet and then finally on once

685
00:24:38,519 --> 00:24:41,119
things are actually getting mature and

686
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,278
there's actually quite a bit of water

687
00:24:41,119 --> 00:24:44,599
demand do we still have enough water

688
00:24:43,278 --> 00:24:46,200
right and this is really the fourth one

689
00:24:44,599 --> 00:24:47,480
is the one we're really asking that's

690
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:49,640
the one we're trying to control with

691
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:51,640
irrigation so the difficulty in trying

692
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:54,960
to understand is how much of our yield

693
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:57,159
is dependent on on moisture availability

694
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:58,840
is also trying to to identify these

695
00:24:57,159 --> 00:25:00,520
other controls on your yield right so

696
00:24:58,839 --> 00:25:02,000
you basically have a bunch of factors a

697
00:25:00,519 --> 00:25:05,000
lot of them not related to moisture

698
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,960
availability or at least um a moisture

699
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:09,200
availability deficit um that you need to

700
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:11,079
kind of eliminate to to see if how

701
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:14,600
important that other factor

702
00:25:11,079 --> 00:25:17,720
is okay so this is just showing um kind

703
00:25:14,599 --> 00:25:20,199
of peak demand for corn um about 80 60

704
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:21,440
to 80 Days in so by July August right

705
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:22,440
that's when we be most interested in

706
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:25,240
having

707
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:27,519
water okay so some interesting studies

708
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:30,880
from people in Canada um actually so I

709
00:25:27,519 --> 00:25:32,879
guess a group um C and all um they were

710
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:34,080
looking at Horticultural crops so they

711
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,559
were doing two things they were looking

712
00:25:34,079 --> 00:25:37,480
at temperature um and they were looking

713
00:25:35,558 --> 00:25:39,440
at mean seasonal temperature and then

714
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:42,200
they were looking at just days over 30

715
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:44,278
so just sort of short sporadic changes

716
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:47,319
um so they saw for a few things cabbage

717
00:25:44,278 --> 00:25:51,159
cauliflower um some significance um just

718
00:25:47,319 --> 00:25:53,319
in days over 30° um and then they

719
00:25:51,159 --> 00:25:54,960
actually saw some significance with um

720
00:25:53,319 --> 00:25:56,359
days with rain not with growing season

721
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:59,600
precipitation but basically short

722
00:25:56,359 --> 00:26:04,479
periods um without without enough rain

723
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:06,119
um so a little bit of evidence there um

724
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:08,278
other sources of evidence out there that

725
00:26:06,119 --> 00:26:11,199
irrigation might actually matter and and

726
00:26:08,278 --> 00:26:14,519
sort of um potentially be useful in the

727
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:17,200
Northeast um so crop insurance data

728
00:26:14,519 --> 00:26:20,278
which is out there um as we can see so

729
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:22,399
this was for apples um blue one for kind

730
00:26:20,278 --> 00:26:24,440
of this is um indemnities for crop

731
00:26:22,398 --> 00:26:27,839
insurance um certainly for apples

732
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:29,200
freezing is a much bigger deal than EX

733
00:26:27,839 --> 00:26:32,000
moisture well actually excess moisture

734
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:34,000
doesn't even show up here right so we do

735
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,119
know they irrigate apples but it appears

736
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,278
and that might be the reason it doesn't

737
00:26:35,119 --> 00:26:39,759
show up is because the irrig it's

738
00:26:37,278 --> 00:26:43,679
already irrigated so people don't need

739
00:26:39,759 --> 00:26:47,599
to um don't include it in terms of crop

740
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:49,600
loss um corn irrigation does show up so

741
00:26:47,599 --> 00:26:52,038
most years at least lately we've had too

742
00:26:49,599 --> 00:26:54,119
much water but 2012 was a dry year it

743
00:26:52,038 --> 00:26:56,599
did show up as people claiming crop

744
00:26:54,119 --> 00:26:58,239
insurance for lack of

745
00:26:56,599 --> 00:27:00,319
water

746
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:03,599
okay and then we've also been doing some

747
00:27:00,319 --> 00:27:05,759
of our own analysis using um Nas data so

748
00:27:03,599 --> 00:27:08,319
National a statistical service data um

749
00:27:05,759 --> 00:27:09,558
using county level data um and what

750
00:27:08,319 --> 00:27:11,200
we've just been doing is just starting

751
00:27:09,558 --> 00:27:13,839
with relatively simple things so just

752
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:16,840
trying to predict um annual yield um and

753
00:27:13,839 --> 00:27:18,599
using Growing Degree Days um using June

754
00:27:16,839 --> 00:27:21,000
precipitation and July precipitation

755
00:27:18,599 --> 00:27:23,278
basically for sufficient water and then

756
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:27,679
using May precipitation for being too

757
00:27:23,278 --> 00:27:29,319
wet early in the season um so this is

758
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:31,000
for Livingston County this is down near

759
00:27:29,319 --> 00:27:33,398
kind of Danville kind of Danville and

760
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:35,159
the kind of the center of the state um

761
00:27:33,398 --> 00:27:36,798
and you can see here not a great model

762
00:27:35,159 --> 00:27:38,480
but the main thing I kind of look at is

763
00:27:36,798 --> 00:27:41,558
do we get the quadrants right in terms

764
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:45,360
of observed versus predicted

765
00:27:41,558 --> 00:27:47,759
um and the other thing to note is that

766
00:27:45,359 --> 00:27:49,879
here importantly if you if you just try

767
00:27:47,759 --> 00:27:52,640
to model just using gdd and early season

768
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:54,960
wetness alone it's not significant so

769
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:58,038
only when you put in precipitation kind

770
00:27:54,960 --> 00:28:00,759
of Summer July June precipitation is it

771
00:27:58,038 --> 00:28:03,720
significant so again some more evidence

772
00:28:00,759 --> 00:28:05,558
suggesting yet yes precipitation or

773
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:07,679
moisture during the growing season is

774
00:28:05,558 --> 00:28:09,879
important things get complicated though

775
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:13,519
so this is another County um this is

776
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:15,720
jness County um and in this one we

777
00:28:13,519 --> 00:28:17,558
actually find the model the best model

778
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:20,079
is actually just includes gdd and just

779
00:28:17,558 --> 00:28:23,480
includes May um early season moisture

780
00:28:20,079 --> 00:28:24,720
not summertime precipitation so we're

781
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:25,720
not quite sure right this is where

782
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:27,519
they're in the process of kind of

783
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:30,919
deciphering if you move around County to

784
00:28:27,519 --> 00:28:31,759
County um why do things change um one

785
00:28:30,919 --> 00:28:33,759
thing there is a little bit of

786
00:28:31,759 --> 00:28:35,720
irrigation in the county 2% but probably

787
00:28:33,759 --> 00:28:37,879
not enough to make a difference um in

788
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:40,240
terms of of changing these relationships

789
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:42,640
here possibility is soils they might

790
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:44,038
have deeper soils um so even if you have

791
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:45,799
less rain you have more moisture

792
00:28:44,038 --> 00:28:48,599
availability over time but we don't

793
00:28:45,798 --> 00:28:50,038
quite know um so we're we're basically

794
00:28:48,599 --> 00:28:51,480
trying to kind of decipher these

795
00:28:50,038 --> 00:28:54,200
relationships and kind of get a better

796
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:56,640
sense of of what's going on um to make

797
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:58,960
the case that irrigation is actually

798
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:00,519
potentially useful um right and then

799
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:02,360
this is only for corn for vegetable

800
00:29:00,519 --> 00:29:04,640
crops and things like that um it might

801
00:29:02,359 --> 00:29:07,119
be a different

802
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:10,799
story okay so kind of the final part of

803
00:29:07,119 --> 00:29:11,959
this is um when we consider this and

804
00:29:10,798 --> 00:29:13,798
part of this project was sort of

805
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:15,558
considering historically what's happened

806
00:29:13,798 --> 00:29:17,000
but then also part of this is basically

807
00:29:15,558 --> 00:29:18,678
looking at potential for climate

808
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:21,519
adaptation with the assumption that

809
00:29:18,679 --> 00:29:24,120
things um likely and will change in the

810
00:29:21,519 --> 00:29:25,480
future um so without at this point we

811
00:29:24,119 --> 00:29:27,798
haven't done our own work but looking at

812
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:30,480
what other people have done um there was

813
00:29:27,798 --> 00:29:32,440
a paper by McDonald and geritz um about

814
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:35,079
two years back and they for the entire

815
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:37,919
United States um looked at moisture

816
00:29:35,079 --> 00:29:39,599
deficit using climate models um and then

817
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:40,880
they basically on changes in moisture

818
00:29:39,599 --> 00:29:42,558
deficit they used historical

819
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:44,399
relationships to irrigation given

820
00:29:42,558 --> 00:29:46,798
moisture deficit and projected how

821
00:29:44,398 --> 00:29:48,278
things might change so for New York

822
00:29:46,798 --> 00:29:50,359
State they said there might be an

823
00:29:48,278 --> 00:29:52,919
increase of up to 25,000 hectares in

824
00:29:50,359 --> 00:29:54,639
irrigated acreage or yeah hectares in

825
00:29:52,919 --> 00:29:57,679
irrigated land

826
00:29:54,640 --> 00:30:00,200
so they recognize something kind of a

827
00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:02,840
well-known study um Anderson and all

828
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:04,679
from about 5 years ago um looking at a

829
00:30:02,839 --> 00:30:06,879
climate assessment in the Northeast um

830
00:30:04,679 --> 00:30:08,960
they also use climate models um looking

831
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:11,440
at changes this is in soil moisture

832
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:13,558
seasonal soil summer soil moisture um

833
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:15,720
and they saw a decline in in summer soil

834
00:30:13,558 --> 00:30:17,079
moisture although not it's a climate

835
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:19,640
model so you know you can't put that

836
00:30:17,079 --> 00:30:22,319
much if any trust in it but it seems

837
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:25,120
like um they did see a decline of about

838
00:30:22,319 --> 00:30:28,000
1 cm so not a huge

839
00:30:25,119 --> 00:30:30,038
amount so it seems reasonable to think

840
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,839
that there in the future there be some

841
00:30:30,038 --> 00:30:34,359
additional moisture deficit and that

842
00:30:31,839 --> 00:30:35,519
might kind of that might be equally

843
00:30:34,359 --> 00:30:37,079
important to not only looking

844
00:30:35,519 --> 00:30:38,839
historically has there been a need for

845
00:30:37,079 --> 00:30:40,759
irrigation but basically changing sort

846
00:30:38,839 --> 00:30:41,798
of the equation of can you justify it

847
00:30:40,759 --> 00:30:45,480
more in the

848
00:30:41,798 --> 00:30:47,038
future okay so as you can kind of tell

849
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:48,839
project is basically ongoing we've been

850
00:30:47,038 --> 00:30:50,079
doing this for about six months and we

851
00:30:48,839 --> 00:30:52,879
basically are going to do it for another

852
00:30:50,079 --> 00:30:55,079
year um but I think we can make a few

853
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:56,880
conclusions already um and kind of and

854
00:30:55,079 --> 00:30:59,558
then think about where we're going to go

855
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:01,000
um so first thing is basically given the

856
00:30:59,558 --> 00:31:03,038
Reliance on run-of- the river supplies

857
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,599
in New York State for the most part um

858
00:31:03,038 --> 00:31:06,879
it doesn't seem it does seem like there

859
00:31:04,599 --> 00:31:09,240
is potential for conflict between users

860
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:10,840
I do know like say for Fall Creek um I

861
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:13,038
we belong to a CSA which is itha

862
00:31:10,839 --> 00:31:14,599
Organics um they recently started

863
00:31:13,038 --> 00:31:16,638
farming right next to the Tom Homer

864
00:31:14,599 --> 00:31:19,038
Thompson vegetable farm and they have a

865
00:31:16,638 --> 00:31:20,719
plan to irrigate um so there's lots of

866
00:31:19,038 --> 00:31:22,599
small users out there who might be using

867
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:24,399
water um that don't necessarily fall

868
00:31:22,599 --> 00:31:27,638
under the 100,000 gallon per day

869
00:31:24,398 --> 00:31:29,479
threshold to report right um so for now

870
00:31:27,638 --> 00:31:31,519
those people kind of remain invisible

871
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:32,480
but um if there's enough of them they

872
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:34,839
might

873
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:36,960
matter um let's see they remain

874
00:31:34,839 --> 00:31:39,759
inconsistencies and and what we do know

875
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:41,278
right in terms of Nas and USGS um it's

876
00:31:39,759 --> 00:31:42,798
there's basically no consistency there's

877
00:31:41,278 --> 00:31:45,200
little consistency between that data

878
00:31:42,798 --> 00:31:47,158
that's being put out there um so clearly

879
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:49,639
clearly gaps in

880
00:31:47,159 --> 00:31:51,919
reporting um despite not really being

881
00:31:49,638 --> 00:31:53,558
intentional the Barge Canal seems to be

882
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:55,559
a really interesting piece of

883
00:31:53,558 --> 00:31:58,000
infrastructure it's currently being used

884
00:31:55,558 --> 00:31:59,599
to some degree um evident by the number

885
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,880
of people clustered around it but I

886
00:31:59,599 --> 00:32:02,839
think there's interesting questions to

887
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:04,559
ask of is there a capacity to put more

888
00:32:02,839 --> 00:32:05,720
people around it and one thing I don't

889
00:32:04,558 --> 00:32:07,200
really get into because I don't have the

890
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:09,240
information yet is right there's an

891
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:11,200
expense with irrigation and to irrigate

892
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:13,839
you basically have to say um is the

893
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:15,519
economical benefit from what you can um

894
00:32:13,839 --> 00:32:16,879
get an increased revenue does it equate

895
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:19,638
what you have to put in in terms of

896
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:20,760
capital right the Barge Canal is

897
00:32:19,638 --> 00:32:22,798
potentially interesting because

898
00:32:20,759 --> 00:32:24,558
everything's nice and flat it's already

899
00:32:22,798 --> 00:32:26,278
right there it might be a pretty cheap

900
00:32:24,558 --> 00:32:28,119
source of irrigation in New York so it

901
00:32:26,278 --> 00:32:29,398
might it might be a pretty economical

902
00:32:28,119 --> 00:32:31,239
way to irrigate

903
00:32:29,398 --> 00:32:34,359
nearby

904
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:36,319
um based on sort of some analysis of

905
00:32:34,359 --> 00:32:38,038
what data is out there dry periods do

906
00:32:36,319 --> 00:32:39,519
cause measurable declines and yield

907
00:32:38,038 --> 00:32:41,200
despite other factors that cause

908
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:43,319
measurable declines so it's definitely

909
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:45,080
we can see it um it's just a matter of

910
00:32:43,319 --> 00:32:49,000
better eeking out you know what is that

911
00:32:45,079 --> 00:32:51,879
as a total percentage of of loss really

912
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:53,319
um and that's sort of the economic part

913
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:55,039
and then as I said at the end climate

914
00:32:53,319 --> 00:32:56,638
change will probably make things more

915
00:32:55,038 --> 00:32:58,558
economically feasible it seems pretty

916
00:32:56,638 --> 00:33:00,719
likely things are going to become D um

917
00:32:58,558 --> 00:33:03,278
in the future how much remains to be

918
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:05,000
seen U so kind of remaining parts of our

919
00:33:03,278 --> 00:33:07,159
project are basically to do an intensive

920
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:10,200
survey in the next few months um of

921
00:33:07,159 --> 00:33:11,799
farmers to basically get more um focused

922
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:13,720
information in terms of what sources of

923
00:33:11,798 --> 00:33:15,359
water they using um how much are they

924
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:17,200
using and what kind of irrigation

925
00:33:15,359 --> 00:33:19,240
equipment are they using um and also

926
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:21,319
what are they irrigating um and then to

927
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:22,839
also continue on with with doing more

928
00:33:21,319 --> 00:33:25,319
crop yield modeling to get a better

929
00:33:22,839 --> 00:33:26,759
sense um but in the end I think it

930
00:33:25,319 --> 00:33:29,798
should be sort of an interesting picture

931
00:33:26,759 --> 00:33:32,599
of sort of this to to a degree sort of

932
00:33:29,798 --> 00:33:34,839
untouched um consideration of

933
00:33:32,599 --> 00:33:36,839
non-potable water use in New York state

934
00:33:34,839 --> 00:33:38,959
um and going out in the future it kind

935
00:33:36,839 --> 00:33:40,798
of it might be some sort of some

936
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:42,278
potential for future investment in

937
00:33:40,798 --> 00:33:44,679
Irrigation in New York if you can kind

938
00:33:42,278 --> 00:33:47,398
of make the case that um there's a place

939
00:33:44,679 --> 00:33:48,919
to to boost production without basically

940
00:33:47,398 --> 00:33:51,479
having too many competing users for the

941
00:33:48,919 --> 00:33:53,679
water so all in there and I'm happy to

942
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:53,679
take

943
00:33:55,960 --> 00:34:00,600
questions

944
00:33:58,679 --> 00:34:03,720
yeah this has been a production of

945
00:34:00,599 --> 00:34:06,719
Cornell University on the web at

946
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:06,720
