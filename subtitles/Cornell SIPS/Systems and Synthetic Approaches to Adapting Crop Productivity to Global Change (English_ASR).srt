1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,800
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:12,000
University um but I will I apologize to

3
00:00:10,359 --> 00:00:14,480
those of you who were were here

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,800
yesterday that I will repeat one or two

5
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:19,079
things but I try and keep the repetition

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:22,199
to a minimum because what I want to talk

7
00:00:19,079 --> 00:00:25,118
about today is is global atmospheric

8
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:28,199
change and how we how we might be able

9
00:00:25,118 --> 00:00:31,160
to adapt crops to that particularly with

10
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:33,679
respect to Rising carbon diox side and

11
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:36,759
also try and explain why I think there

12
00:00:33,679 --> 00:00:39,558
is mileage in trying to make those

13
00:00:36,759 --> 00:00:42,960
adaptations um I should say at the

14
00:00:39,558 --> 00:00:45,238
outset that I can only give this talk uh

15
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:48,520
because of the work done by past

16
00:00:45,238 --> 00:00:54,000
graduate students Lisa rainsworth K

17
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:58,000
banaki uh will hay Jin wanju um and

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,518
posts Justin McGrath and venat sassen

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,478
and also um faculty colleagues Donald

20
00:01:00,518 --> 00:01:06,798
and pine Kumar who've all helped um in

21
00:01:04,478 --> 00:01:11,118
doing this work oh and Darren Drury who

22
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:13,118
was a postto working with me as well um

23
00:01:11,118 --> 00:01:15,239
so this is where I work the Institute of

24
00:01:13,118 --> 00:01:17,359
genomic biology at the University of

25
00:01:15,239 --> 00:01:20,199
Illinois um in front of that are the

26
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:22,280
mororo plots the oldest agricultural

27
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:25,920
experiment outside of rothamstead

28
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:28,719
England um and I just wanted to show

29
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:30,840
this sort of connection that we have so

30
00:01:28,719 --> 00:01:35,359
much of the fil work our show you is

31
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:37,040
done um very close to this location so a

32
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:40,680
lot of the work shows an interplay

33
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:42,960
between lab modeling and field work and

34
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:47,439
I hope I hope that'll be

35
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:50,158
apparent so what are we concerned about

36
00:01:47,438 --> 00:01:51,758
um whatever is debated there is no

37
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:54,920
debate about the fact that the carbon

38
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:57,640
dioxide atmosphere in the carbon dioxide

39
00:01:54,920 --> 00:02:00,439
concentration in the atmosphere is

40
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:03,159
rising um and it

41
00:02:00,438 --> 00:02:06,239
really rising at a quite unprecedented

42
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:11,080
rate in geological history at the

43
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:14,799
present time um most of our crop

44
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:16,680
ancestors evolved in the average CO2

45
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:19,760
concentration of the last 10 million

46
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:22,760
years which was about 220 parts per

47
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:25,840
million today we're over 400 parts per

48
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:28,399
million so we're we're close to doubling

49
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:31,840
what those crop ancestors evolved

50
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,840
evolved in

51
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:37,440
um if we look at what is

52
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:40,878
driving climate

53
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:42,680
change in the atmosphere then CO2 of

54
00:02:40,878 --> 00:02:47,158
course is the biggest contributor to

55
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:49,519
this but also methane nitrous oxide

56
00:02:47,158 --> 00:02:53,120
halocarbons are an important part of

57
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:56,439
this and one that's often overlooked is

58
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:58,759
tropospheric Ozone most greenhouse gases

59
00:02:56,439 --> 00:03:02,560
are heter Atomic molecules carbon

60
00:02:58,759 --> 00:03:05,399
dioxide nitrous oxide but ozone also

61
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:08,598
behaves as a het Atomic molecule and it

62
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:10,799
absorbs him for radiation so it is a

63
00:03:08,598 --> 00:03:11,798
part of the greenhouse effect when it's

64
00:03:10,799 --> 00:03:13,599
in the

65
00:03:11,799 --> 00:03:16,200
troposphere

66
00:03:13,598 --> 00:03:20,199
um in the stratosphere of course it's

67
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:22,560
important in absorbing UV radiation and

68
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:24,839
our activities have greatly increased

69
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:28,280
ozone in in the

70
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:30,560
troposphere and that ozone is also toxic

71
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:35,438
to plant so it has a direct effect as

72
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:39,080
well as an indirect effect um other

73
00:03:35,438 --> 00:03:42,639
aspects uh Aerosoles actually cause a

74
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:46,439
cooling effect um increase in cloud

75
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:49,119
cover as we warm up the atmosphere has a

76
00:03:46,438 --> 00:03:51,519
feedback effect as well but overall the

77
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:56,239
anthropogenic effect is strongly

78
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:58,200
positive leading to um increased energy

79
00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:01,878
in the

80
00:03:58,199 --> 00:04:05,280
troposphere so that is predicted to lead

81
00:04:01,878 --> 00:04:07,078
to on average A 1 to2 degre C

82
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,959
temperature rise by

83
00:04:07,079 --> 00:04:11,680
2050 now

84
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:15,598
although precipitation is

85
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:17,680
rising um drought is also Rising because

86
00:04:15,598 --> 00:04:18,879
with Rising temperature we have more of

87
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,639
AA

88
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:22,879
transpiration also the with increased

89
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:25,519
energy in the

90
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:30,719
atmosphere events become more

91
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:33,560
intense uh more if you like chaos itic

92
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:36,600
so this will probably also lead to more

93
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:39,038
drought events we think that surface

94
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:42,000
ozone today averages about 50 parts per

95
00:04:39,038 --> 00:04:45,519
billion in the northern hemisphere we

96
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:49,000
think that will rise to between 60 to 90

97
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:51,120
parts per billion depending on whether

98
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,918
really controls proposed by a number of

99
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:56,319
companies really sorry countries bite or

100
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:59,680
whether they don't a lot of this Rises

101
00:04:56,319 --> 00:05:02,680
actually south of us in the tropics

102
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:05,600
ically in East Asia as well but these

103
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:09,038
are really if you like three major Glo

104
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:11,600
four major Global change issues that our

105
00:05:09,038 --> 00:05:14,680
crops will have to face by

106
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:16,600
2050 and indeed are facing already

107
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:19,759
because you know as I said the crop

108
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:21,520
ancestors evolved in a CO2 concentration

109
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:26,360
that is very different to the one we

110
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:29,879
have today and indeed tropospheric ozone

111
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:32,600
we think pre-industrial was probably no

112
00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:35,079
more than 10 parts per billion today it

113
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:38,560
averages 50 parts per billion we

114
00:05:35,079 --> 00:05:41,198
frequently see 100 parts per billion in

115
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:46,120
Central Illinois um

116
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:49,080
today so so what is the problem uh what

117
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:52,759
are the impacts of rising CO2 and how

118
00:05:49,079 --> 00:05:56,839
might we adapt to Rising CO2 they're the

119
00:05:52,759 --> 00:05:56,840
three things I want to try and look

120
00:05:58,038 --> 00:06:06,159
at so again as I showed yesterday

121
00:06:01,959 --> 00:06:08,680
our four major crops globally in terms

122
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:10,960
of if you like these are the crops that

123
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:15,079
provide over

124
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:19,519
2/3 directly or indirectly of human

125
00:06:15,079 --> 00:06:22,359
calories um so maze is number one um and

126
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:23,719
it's C4 so it has a different response

127
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:27,479
to Rising

128
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:32,160
CO2 um rice and wheat on the other hand

129
00:06:27,478 --> 00:06:35,240
a C3 very important as direct sources of

130
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:38,039
human calories and then soy very

131
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:42,000
important protein source so those last

132
00:06:38,038 --> 00:06:45,560
three are all C3 crops and should

133
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:49,639
respond very strongly to Rising carbon

134
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:52,560
dioxide and as I showed yesterday um

135
00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:55,478
we're responsible for the United States

136
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:58,360
produces almost a third of the world's

137
00:06:55,478 --> 00:07:00,079
soy production a very significant part

138
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:04,120
of wheat production

139
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:07,198
and over a third of of maze

140
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:09,959
production now if we look at how we're

141
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:12,680
improving the yield of these crops then

142
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:14,598
if we take the historical trajectory and

143
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:17,400
we say well we ought to be able to

144
00:07:14,598 --> 00:07:19,560
continue that into the future then we

145
00:07:17,399 --> 00:07:25,079
would end up at this point by

146
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:28,120
2050 but what FAO and John F's group at

147
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:31,079
um Minnesota have projected is that this

148
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:33,879
is what we will need by 2050 so we

149
00:07:31,079 --> 00:07:35,839
really need to get onto this trajectory

150
00:07:33,879 --> 00:07:40,680
because staying on this

151
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:43,318
one will result in significant shortages

152
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:46,959
significant price increases that will

153
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:50,240
affect the poorest in the global

154
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:52,279
Community I should also point out that

155
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:56,199
um I've just added on here

156
00:07:52,279 --> 00:07:58,519
casava casava is a crop which many many

157
00:07:56,199 --> 00:08:01,000
small holders poor communities

158
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:05,198
particularly in sub Saharan Africa

159
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:07,519
depend on and I think these yield

160
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:11,038
improvements which we show for our major

161
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:13,758
crops are not apparent in some of these

162
00:08:11,038 --> 00:08:16,318
M what we might call minor crops but

163
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:19,038
actually extremely important crops for

164
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:21,199
those those communities we we have

165
00:08:19,038 --> 00:08:24,959
failed to improve those at the rate that

166
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:27,280
we're improving our our best crops or

167
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:29,758
rather shouldn't say our best crops our

168
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:33,639
if you like our top crops the ones which

169
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:36,360
particularly matter to the developed

170
00:08:33,639 --> 00:08:39,399
World um the picture though is a little

171
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:41,320
bit worse because if we look at these

172
00:08:39,399 --> 00:08:44,600
rice and wheat for example the same's

173
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:47,519
true of soy that if we look at during

174
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:51,399
the Green Revolution years then we were

175
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:55,560
improving average global yields by 30 to

176
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:59,440
40% per decade so a huge change in

177
00:08:55,559 --> 00:09:01,838
global food supply the this really

178
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,519
eliminated the major famines that had

179
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:07,079
been seen in the

180
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:10,078
1960s so so the Green Revolution had a

181
00:09:07,078 --> 00:09:13,679
huge impact at that stage but as we move

182
00:09:10,078 --> 00:09:17,799
away we see that wheat and rice really

183
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:20,159
the yield improvements are are declining

184
00:09:17,799 --> 00:09:22,879
and in fact in the last decade wheat

185
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:25,559
wasn't improved at all and rice is now

186
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:25,559
in single

187
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:31,079
figures now I just want to put up an

188
00:09:28,679 --> 00:09:35,000
equation developed by John Monte at

189
00:09:31,078 --> 00:09:36,879
rothamstead which explains at least why

190
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:40,200
we may be running out of steam with

191
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:43,278
genetic yield potential I yielder crop

192
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:46,839
will achieve when it's grown under

193
00:09:43,278 --> 00:09:50,639
Optimum conditions so no diseases no

194
00:09:46,839 --> 00:09:53,120
pests um adequate water and adequate

195
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:55,559
nutrients and what this tells us is that

196
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:57,278
the yield of a crop will depend on how

197
00:09:55,559 --> 00:10:00,319
much sunlight is available for

198
00:09:57,278 --> 00:10:02,039
photosynthesis by the crop um and I

199
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:05,079
should say here we're just interested in

200
00:10:02,039 --> 00:10:06,838
the visible sunlight because that is all

201
00:10:05,078 --> 00:10:09,599
plants use in

202
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:12,320
photosynthesis um how good they are at

203
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:14,440
capturing that light so what is the

204
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:17,278
efficiency with which they capture it

205
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:19,560
during the growing season how efficient

206
00:10:17,278 --> 00:10:21,639
are they at then converting that

207
00:10:19,559 --> 00:10:25,159
captured light

208
00:10:21,639 --> 00:10:28,480
into um

209
00:10:25,159 --> 00:10:31,000
biomass and then how good are they at

210
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:33,399
partitioning that biomass into the part

211
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,399
of the crop we care about so the grain

212
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:38,519
of wheat the grain of

213
00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:41,120
rice and these are just data for soybean

214
00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:44,360
crop on our University Farm modern

215
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:46,759
soybean crop growing on not growing with

216
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:49,200
irrigation but growing on a deep Midwest

217
00:10:46,759 --> 00:10:51,799
soil where there's plenty of water

218
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:54,399
available and basically what we see is

219
00:10:51,799 --> 00:10:57,078
that interception efficiency and

220
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:59,399
partitioning efficiency are already

221
00:10:57,078 --> 00:11:03,319
remarkably High

222
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:05,519
and the these are um in the case of rice

223
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:08,000
and wheat these are products of the

224
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:10,240
Green Revolution that's really what we

225
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,559
changed in rice and wheat that

226
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:16,759
partitioning efficiencies went up from

227
00:11:12,559 --> 00:11:20,719
30% to 60% interception efficiency

228
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:23,720
improved as well and if we really you

229
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:26,399
know look at these These are pretty well

230
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:28,120
hitting on their biological Maxima so

231
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:30,799
there isn't really much more we can

232
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:34,120
squeeze out of

233
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:37,759
those um but so what I should point out

234
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:40,159
is this number conversion efficiency and

235
00:11:37,759 --> 00:11:42,519
this is really a very good number for

236
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:46,120
most crops a

237
00:11:42,519 --> 00:11:49,159
3% is only a third of the theoretical

238
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:51,240
value so conversion efficiency

239
00:11:49,159 --> 00:11:55,199
photosynthesis is one thing where

240
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:58,759
there's an opportunity still to improve

241
00:11:55,200 --> 00:12:00,519
on um yield potential genetic yield

242
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:04,360
potential

243
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:07,679
so how does co2 tie into this what does

244
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:10,759
co2 do to crop

245
00:12:07,679 --> 00:12:12,919
plants well from a theoretical point of

246
00:12:10,759 --> 00:12:17,439
view the only way a plant can

247
00:12:12,919 --> 00:12:19,479
sense CO2 the to the CO2 changes at the

248
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:24,279
levels that we're dealing with if you

249
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:26,278
put a plant in um 10% CO2 then you

250
00:12:24,278 --> 00:12:29,320
change its pH and all sorts of things

251
00:12:26,278 --> 00:12:31,480
start to happen but if you just for

252
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:33,920
example Elevate CO2 from where we are

253
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:37,440
today to where we think we be in the

254
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:40,399
latter half of this Century they're only

255
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:43,680
really two ways a plant can sense this

256
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:45,480
one is the key carboxylase in

257
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:48,719
photosynthesis

258
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:53,159
rubisco um is not CO2

259
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:54,600
saturated and it also um catalyzes a

260
00:12:53,159 --> 00:12:56,198
process called

261
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:59,839
photorespiration

262
00:12:56,198 --> 00:13:02,519
CO2 increases saturation of rubisco

263
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:05,240
and it inhibits that oxygenation

264
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:08,959
reaction which leads to

265
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:11,600
photorespiration so it's sensed at

266
00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:14,759
rubisco it's also sensed of the level of

267
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:18,320
stamata and how this happens is not

268
00:13:14,759 --> 00:13:21,838
fully understood but stamata will

269
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:23,839
close um in response to Rising CO2 and

270
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:26,279
we we don't know how much of that is

271
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:28,839
really a direct effect but if you strip

272
00:13:26,278 --> 00:13:31,600
off the epidermis of many plants float

273
00:13:28,839 --> 00:13:35,680
them on water subject them to elevated

274
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:38,920
CO2 you will see a closing response now

275
00:13:35,679 --> 00:13:42,399
it was thought for many years um that

276
00:13:38,919 --> 00:13:44,719
respiration was also affected by CO2

277
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:47,679
people took out there some of you may be

278
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:50,720
facil familiar with Lor gas exchange

279
00:13:47,679 --> 00:13:55,838
systems or other gas exchange

280
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:58,000
systems they they put these on Plants

281
00:13:55,839 --> 00:14:01,320
elevated the CO2 in the chamber and they

282
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:03,360
saw a suppression of respiration but we

283
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:07,120
were very suspicious that what's going

284
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:09,600
on is it's very difficult to prevent CO2

285
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:14,278
from leaking out of these systems

286
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:16,278
completely prevent it and um so what we

287
00:14:14,278 --> 00:14:18,278
eventually managed to do was get a

288
00:14:16,278 --> 00:14:21,838
manufacturer who could actually give us

289
00:14:18,278 --> 00:14:24,879
a differential oxygen system um this was

290
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:27,399
about a year of work but so that we

291
00:14:24,879 --> 00:14:28,799
could instead measure oxygen uptake

292
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:31,039
which is much more of a challenge

293
00:14:28,799 --> 00:14:33,958
because because there is so much more

294
00:14:31,039 --> 00:14:36,559
oxygen in the atmosphere but but when we

295
00:14:33,958 --> 00:14:38,958
eventually got this working to our

296
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:40,958
satisfaction the the postto in the lab

297
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:44,078
who was doing it was saying well I'm

298
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:47,039
doubling CO2 and I'm not seeing anything

299
00:14:44,078 --> 00:14:50,679
so I said well put through 1% CO2 and

300
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:53,639
see what happens he put through 1% CO2

301
00:14:50,679 --> 00:14:55,758
and we saw absolutely nothing so we

302
00:14:53,639 --> 00:14:59,079
published that in plant physiology and I

303
00:14:55,759 --> 00:15:03,879
think the idea that CO2 is suppressing

304
00:14:59,078 --> 00:15:07,359
respiration has gone away uh now so at

305
00:15:03,879 --> 00:15:07,360
least we can whoop

306
00:15:10,759 --> 00:15:19,120
sorry we can simplify what really a

307
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:21,639
plant can see in terms of CO2 now so at

308
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:25,759
the level of rubisco what CO2 is doing

309
00:15:21,639 --> 00:15:29,839
is um CO2 of course is the substrate for

310
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:33,039
conversion of ubp to two mole ules of

311
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:34,680
phosphoglycolate in the Calvin cycle but

312
00:15:33,039 --> 00:15:39,039
oxygen

313
00:15:34,679 --> 00:15:41,239
also um reacts catalyzed by rubisco

314
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:44,679
because that's why there's the o on the

315
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:47,959
end of rubisco to produce glycolate if

316
00:15:44,679 --> 00:15:52,159
glycolate is produced then the plant

317
00:15:47,958 --> 00:15:55,479
recycles that back to PGA but in doing

318
00:15:52,159 --> 00:16:00,799
so it loses a carbon dioxide it consumes

319
00:15:55,480 --> 00:16:04,278
a great deal of um the nadph and ATP

320
00:16:00,799 --> 00:16:07,679
generated by the Light reactions so it

321
00:16:04,278 --> 00:16:10,838
imposes an inefficiency on the overall

322
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:14,198
photosynthetic process if you elevate

323
00:16:10,839 --> 00:16:16,440
CO2 you do two things you increase the

324
00:16:14,198 --> 00:16:19,879
saturation of rubisco with

325
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:21,399
CO2 and you competitively inhibit this

326
00:16:19,879 --> 00:16:25,639
oxygenation

327
00:16:21,399 --> 00:16:28,440
reaction so that that is why glass house

328
00:16:25,639 --> 00:16:29,639
Growers it's worth their while elevating

329
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:32,560
their to

330
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:37,519
tomato crop with CO2 because they get a

331
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:40,479
a high yield precisely because of this

332
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:43,120
mechanism so it's harder when it comes

333
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:45,759
to fi crops though to assess what CO2

334
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:49,360
will do and so a lot of the information

335
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:52,278
we have comes from chamber systems green

336
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:55,440
houses um controlled

337
00:16:52,278 --> 00:16:58,399
environments and also small Chambers put

338
00:16:55,440 --> 00:17:00,920
over crops in the field but when you do

339
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:02,639
this even in the field situation you're

340
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:04,599
changing a lot of things you're lowering

341
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:06,558
the light level you're raising

342
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:09,000
temperature a little bit you're raising

343
00:17:06,558 --> 00:17:11,519
humidity you're completely altering

344
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,880
coupling with with the movement of the

345
00:17:11,519 --> 00:17:16,639
air and you've got Edge effects because

346
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:19,280
often the crop around the edges of this

347
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:23,959
has been knocked down and so lights

348
00:17:19,279 --> 00:17:25,480
coming in from the side and so we we

349
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:27,959
were really basing much of our

350
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:31,640
prediction on what would happen on crops

351
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:35,160
on very AR official systems that

352
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:37,679
Monsanto or senta would never use plots

353
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:40,720
this size to decide whether their latest

354
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:43,440
trans Gene is is doing anything they

355
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:47,400
want an open crop field many of them to

356
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:49,919
do this and yet we're basically um

357
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:52,080
predicting our future on

358
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:54,320
experiments much smaller and much

359
00:17:52,079 --> 00:17:55,599
simpler than industry would ever use for

360
00:17:54,319 --> 00:17:58,639
its business

361
00:17:55,599 --> 00:18:00,439
model so when I moved to Illinois there

362
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:02,840
was a chance there with particularly

363
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:05,159
with the university farm and a big

364
00:18:02,839 --> 00:18:07,759
engineering school to do something

365
00:18:05,159 --> 00:18:09,840
different and this was something

366
00:18:07,759 --> 00:18:12,679
actually first developed for Oz work

367
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:15,480
with ozone and Atmospheric pollutants by

368
00:18:12,679 --> 00:18:18,559
Andrew McLoud in the UK and then was

369
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:20,558
taken up by Brook Haven National Lab um

370
00:18:18,558 --> 00:18:23,038
when I worked there in the early '90s

371
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:25,399
and then when I moved to Illinois there

372
00:18:23,038 --> 00:18:27,919
was a chance to really refine that which

373
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:31,080
is what we did and um well what the

374
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:33,559
engineers did I didn't do it but but

375
00:18:31,079 --> 00:18:35,798
basically what these systems do is that

376
00:18:33,558 --> 00:18:38,440
here we have our soybean crop we do the

377
00:18:35,798 --> 00:18:41,720
same thing in maze um and also this has

378
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:43,679
been done with wheat and rice um we've

379
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:45,720
given our design to groups in China

380
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:48,640
which have now done this very

381
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:50,519
successfully with rice but basically

382
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:55,640
what happens is if the wind is coming in

383
00:18:50,519 --> 00:18:59,519
this direction it's sensed here um and

384
00:18:55,640 --> 00:19:02,280
CO2 is released on the upwind side it's

385
00:18:59,519 --> 00:19:04,240
feathered so that most is released

386
00:19:02,279 --> 00:19:07,839
immediately up wind and then less as you

387
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:10,200
go to the sides and it's stepped

388
00:19:07,839 --> 00:19:12,839
according to the wind speed as well in

389
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:15,279
the center we have a CO2 analyzer an

390
00:19:12,839 --> 00:19:17,720
infr analyzer to check that the

391
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:20,440
algorithm is doing the right thing and

392
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:23,720
if it is over it backs it off if it's

393
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:26,400
under it releases more and so here you

394
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:30,079
can see a test of the system we switch

395
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:33,600
it on at this point and with Target is

396
00:19:30,079 --> 00:19:36,359
550 parts per million and it it gets

397
00:19:33,599 --> 00:19:39,399
within plus or minus 10% of that Target

398
00:19:36,359 --> 00:19:42,678
for about 96% of the time over the

399
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:46,880
growing season this is an infrared image

400
00:19:42,679 --> 00:19:48,919
oh sorry this is an infrared image and

401
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:52,720
of course as I said

402
00:19:48,919 --> 00:19:55,400
CO2 causes partial stomatal closure so

403
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:57,919
the plants are transpiring less they're

404
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:59,440
losing less heat lat and heat therefore

405
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:02,559
they get warmer

406
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:04,159
and so you can see um that it's warmer

407
00:20:02,558 --> 00:20:07,759
within the ring and that's fairly

408
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:10,720
uniform compared to the

409
00:20:07,759 --> 00:20:13,919
outside um

410
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:16,519
now um one of my former students and one

411
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:19,520
of my former posts both went away from

412
00:20:16,519 --> 00:20:20,720
Illinois and then came back as faculty

413
00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:23,279
and they're now doing their own

414
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:26,200
experiments in this system and Andrew

415
00:20:23,279 --> 00:20:29,558
leaky has developed a rain out shelter

416
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:31,960
system where actually his this deploys

417
00:20:29,558 --> 00:20:34,879
at night when we get

418
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:38,600
about a two-thirds of our rainfall in

419
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:43,720
fact in the Corn Belt due to um

420
00:20:38,599 --> 00:20:46,558
convectional storms so if if rain if the

421
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:48,919
thing senses rain it deploys a shelter

422
00:20:46,558 --> 00:20:51,519
which collects the rain in the gut pipes

423
00:20:48,919 --> 00:20:54,919
that away from the site and he imposes a

424
00:20:51,519 --> 00:20:57,839
drought here car has developed uh an

425
00:20:54,919 --> 00:21:00,640
open air heating system so he can raise

426
00:20:57,839 --> 00:21:03,639
the temperature of the crop Within These

427
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:06,038
rings as well so we've now got CO2

428
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:09,520
drought and temperature

429
00:21:06,038 --> 00:21:12,919
combined um So within the experiment

430
00:21:09,519 --> 00:21:15,960
we've got those added on these rings are

431
00:21:12,919 --> 00:21:18,720
about 20 M diameter so gives you over

432
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:21,278
300 square meters of crop so you can do

433
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:24,200
a lot of things with with that that you

434
00:21:21,278 --> 00:21:25,679
can't do with a small system and so you

435
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:29,278
can look at everything from gene

436
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:31,320
expression to the final yield um

437
00:21:29,278 --> 00:21:35,400
harvested with a small plot

438
00:21:31,319 --> 00:21:38,639
combine we've so we have four of these

439
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:42,320
in soybean and replicated in maze they

440
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:44,640
in CO2 four in elevated ozone four

441
00:21:42,319 --> 00:21:47,240
looking at the combination and then

442
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:49,640
controls and then we have split plots

443
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:52,000
with the temperature and drought

444
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:55,840
treatments we've also looked at a range

445
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:59,839
of cultivars in there as well

446
00:21:55,839 --> 00:22:02,480
although for most breeders 20 6 is way

447
00:21:59,839 --> 00:22:04,720
too small to really do any breeding

448
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:07,919
project but you could replicate this

449
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:09,558
technology up to much larger

450
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:12,600
areas

451
00:22:09,558 --> 00:22:16,158
um so what did we find when we did this

452
00:22:12,599 --> 00:22:18,399
under the open air well um and I should

453
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:20,880
say this has also been done with wheat

454
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:24,320
this was an experiment in Arizona this

455
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:26,880
was an experiment in Japan and there've

456
00:22:24,319 --> 00:22:32,119
have been more of those around the world

457
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:37,120
but two to few I believe so this is this

458
00:22:32,119 --> 00:22:39,519
shows um soybean and wheat data from

459
00:22:37,119 --> 00:22:42,158
different chamber

460
00:22:39,519 --> 00:22:43,960
experiments and so you can fit a line to

461
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:46,360
those against

462
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:48,759
CO2 but this is what we found in our

463
00:22:46,359 --> 00:22:51,678
face experiment of course that's just

464
00:22:48,759 --> 00:22:54,158
one CO2 level but basically we were

465
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:56,320
finding what we see under open air

466
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:59,278
conditions is about half of what have

467
00:22:56,319 --> 00:23:01,639
been reported on average in chamber

468
00:22:59,278 --> 00:23:05,599
conditions and with maze the picture was

469
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:06,480
even worse that this is the projection

470
00:23:05,599 --> 00:23:08,519
from

471
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:10,919
chambers and of course many of these

472
00:23:08,519 --> 00:23:12,798
plants are grown in but they're all

473
00:23:10,919 --> 00:23:15,679
pretty well grown nearly all grown in

474
00:23:12,798 --> 00:23:19,319
pots um and this is what we see in the

475
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:22,038
open air so no stimulation at all and

476
00:23:19,319 --> 00:23:25,038
we've done this now over over 10 years

477
00:23:22,038 --> 00:23:29,038
we still haven't seen a yield increase

478
00:23:25,038 --> 00:23:32,480
um So Lisa answorth looked at this in

479
00:23:29,038 --> 00:23:36,079
more detail that that was published in

480
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:38,640
2006 by 2008 there were twice as many

481
00:23:36,079 --> 00:23:41,399
face experiments to draw on and she

482
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:44,640
showed again that what you see on in the

483
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:48,240
open air the nearest proxy to a farmer

484
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:50,679
field was only half of what was

485
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:53,558
expected it's the modelers I think are

486
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:56,200
still not convinced of our results and

487
00:23:53,558 --> 00:23:59,000
even in the latest ipcc they're

488
00:23:56,200 --> 00:24:01,919
suggesting that Rising Co two will

489
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:05,159
rescue us from the problems of rising

490
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:08,799
temperature and and drought I I don't

491
00:24:05,159 --> 00:24:11,720
subscribe to that view and I think

492
00:24:08,798 --> 00:24:15,038
we if there's doubt about it we should

493
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:17,440
be trying to look at how we could adapt

494
00:24:15,038 --> 00:24:20,038
to it if we don't need it that would be

495
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:24,720
great but if we do it'll be too late if

496
00:24:20,038 --> 00:24:27,240
we don't start doing something now so um

497
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:28,960
if we look at go back to John Monti's

498
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:31,038
equations

499
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:33,278
what we see is indeed conversion

500
00:24:31,038 --> 00:24:35,398
efficiency at the crop level is

501
00:24:33,278 --> 00:24:37,919
increased and that plays through to

502
00:24:35,398 --> 00:24:40,959
yield but it's only about half of what

503
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:45,159
we think we should

504
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:49,079
get so how might we adapt to that Rising

505
00:24:45,159 --> 00:24:51,799
CO2 and try and get the kind of yield

506
00:24:49,079 --> 00:24:55,000
increase we think we should

507
00:24:51,798 --> 00:24:57,558
obtain um

508
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:59,119
again we this is something we started

509
00:24:57,558 --> 00:25:02,079
when I was working on the project but

510
00:24:59,119 --> 00:25:04,398
Lisa answorth has now taken this much

511
00:25:02,079 --> 00:25:06,798
further and what we're doing here is

512
00:25:04,398 --> 00:25:10,000
looking at genetic variation in

513
00:25:06,798 --> 00:25:13,480
response and so if we look at seed yield

514
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:16,319
of a range of cultivars we can see that

515
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:17,599
this basically means no response but up

516
00:25:16,319 --> 00:25:20,240
here we've got

517
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:22,558
cultivars that are clearly responding

518
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:24,759
more strongly so it appears there are

519
00:25:22,558 --> 00:25:27,918
some genetics there that could be

520
00:25:24,759 --> 00:25:30,359
exploited to adapt the crop but really

521
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:33,840
to do do this you would need a m if you

522
00:25:30,359 --> 00:25:35,639
like a much larger face system and you

523
00:25:33,839 --> 00:25:38,278
probably need you'd need it in different

524
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:41,120
locations because we're pretty well in

525
00:25:38,278 --> 00:25:43,440
the center of the soybean growing area

526
00:25:41,119 --> 00:25:47,359
but there's plenty of soybean grown in

527
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:50,600
Minnesota plenty grown south of us

528
00:25:47,359 --> 00:25:53,959
where growing season lengths conditions

529
00:25:50,599 --> 00:25:56,319
are quite different but it does suggest

530
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:58,840
that this is something that could well

531
00:25:56,319 --> 00:26:02,359
be exploited

532
00:25:58,839 --> 00:26:06,119
um one of the

533
00:26:02,359 --> 00:26:09,558
major um issues is really that around

534
00:26:06,119 --> 00:26:12,479
this rubisco issue so we know from

535
00:26:09,558 --> 00:26:16,119
Theory what should happen which should

536
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:17,640
be about a 30% yield increase and we can

537
00:26:16,119 --> 00:26:19,639
sometimes see that in chamber

538
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:20,960
experiments but in practice we're

539
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:24,919
getting a lot

540
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:29,240
less um so as I mentioned

541
00:26:24,919 --> 00:26:32,840
CO2 is if you like suppressing f to

542
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:35,839
respiration and enhancing CO2

543
00:26:32,839 --> 00:26:39,480
uptake but temperature has the opposite

544
00:26:35,839 --> 00:26:42,398
effect temperature makes rubisco less

545
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:44,640
specific so as temperature increases

546
00:26:42,398 --> 00:26:48,119
rubisco becomes less able to

547
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:51,399
discriminate between oxygen and CO2 and

548
00:26:48,119 --> 00:26:54,798
photorespiration goes up and if you you

549
00:26:51,398 --> 00:26:57,879
model this from rubisco Kinetics put

550
00:26:54,798 --> 00:27:01,200
that into a crop canopy what you see is

551
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:02,360
that this is the actual gain you get

552
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:06,000
with

553
00:27:02,359 --> 00:27:08,879
temperature um sorry this is the actual

554
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:11,720
photosynthesis at the canopy level this

555
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:13,880
is what you could get if you eliminated

556
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:16,200
photorespiration and that gain that

557
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:18,720
difference becomes much bigger with

558
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:21,679
Rising temperature so we got two things

559
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:25,640
going on Rising CO2 and Rising

560
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:28,320
temperature working against each

561
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:32,559
other now

562
00:27:28,319 --> 00:27:35,398
one way in which this could be overcome

563
00:27:32,558 --> 00:27:37,759
synthetically is for example with C4

564
00:27:35,398 --> 00:27:39,278
photosynthesis is one of those if we

565
00:27:37,759 --> 00:27:42,960
could make these crops

566
00:27:39,278 --> 00:27:46,640
C4 then we could overcome this problem

567
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:49,399
another way um and Morin Hansen and I

568
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:53,159
have both been involved in this area is

569
00:27:49,398 --> 00:27:57,000
that c bacteria the ancestors of the

570
00:27:53,159 --> 00:28:00,320
chloroplasts um also have these bodies

571
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:01,159
called carboxy s where which contain

572
00:28:00,319 --> 00:28:03,439
their

573
00:28:01,159 --> 00:28:05,919
rubisco they actively take up

574
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:13,080
bicarbonate into their

575
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:16,480
cells and they also um will hydrate any

576
00:28:13,079 --> 00:28:19,240
CO2 as well so that out here you have a

577
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:22,919
high concentration of bicarbonate and no

578
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:25,839
carbon dioxide in this body called the

579
00:28:22,919 --> 00:28:28,559
carboxysome they have Carbonic and

580
00:28:25,839 --> 00:28:31,759
hydrates which catalyzes the conversion

581
00:28:28,558 --> 00:28:34,678
of bicarbonate to CO2 so there's a very

582
00:28:31,759 --> 00:28:37,319
high concentration of CO2 here which the

583
00:28:34,679 --> 00:28:40,080
rabisco can take up because there's a

584
00:28:37,319 --> 00:28:41,079
high concentration of CO2 they do not

585
00:28:40,079 --> 00:28:42,960
have

586
00:28:41,079 --> 00:28:45,678
photorespiration so there's an active

587
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:47,558
effort now to try and engineer this

588
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:49,798
system into the

589
00:28:47,558 --> 00:28:52,440
chloroplast so that would be one way of

590
00:28:49,798 --> 00:28:56,000
dealing with this Justin McGrath who's

591
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:59,919
been working with Morin and myself um on

592
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:01,720
modeling this system has has developed a

593
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:05,080
diffusion

594
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:08,480
um reaction model which really looks at

595
00:29:05,079 --> 00:29:11,278
all these components and the sequence in

596
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:14,079
which this would ideally be engineered

597
00:29:11,278 --> 00:29:17,880
but basically what he shows is in theory

598
00:29:14,079 --> 00:29:22,798
if you could put this in to a crop plant

599
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:29,360
like soybean you could get almost a um

600
00:29:22,798 --> 00:29:29,359
up to a 60% increase in CO2 uptake

601
00:29:30,679 --> 00:29:37,679
now um will hay working with Tom

602
00:29:33,839 --> 00:29:41,278
Clemente and myself put in just one cob

603
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:45,000
bacterial Gene whose function is still

604
00:29:41,278 --> 00:29:47,319
really unknown but it there's quite a

605
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:50,159
lot of evidence that it appears to

606
00:29:47,319 --> 00:29:54,439
improve CO2 access to

607
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:57,039
rubisco and so will'll put so will using

608
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:59,600
um soybean transform with this one

609
00:29:57,038 --> 00:30:02,919
gene showed that photosynthesis was

610
00:29:59,599 --> 00:30:06,199
indeed increased seed Mass was increased

611
00:30:02,919 --> 00:30:08,960
and these are fi trials one of the most

612
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:11,640
important findings he made was that the

613
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:14,399
maximum efficiency of light limited

614
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:15,880
photosynthesis went up and this was

615
00:30:14,398 --> 00:30:19,798
statistically

616
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:22,240
significant um and there's only

617
00:30:19,798 --> 00:30:24,679
really three ways in which this is

618
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:28,399
possible you have a different rubisco

619
00:30:24,679 --> 00:30:31,200
which seems highly unlikely because um

620
00:30:28,398 --> 00:30:35,398
the large subunit at least is doesn't

621
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:38,558
have multiple forms um there's more

622
00:30:35,398 --> 00:30:40,678
oxygen which again sorry less oxygen

623
00:30:38,558 --> 00:30:44,960
which again is extremely difficult

624
00:30:40,679 --> 00:30:47,519
because there's 21% outside so inside

625
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:50,120
it's probably 29

626
00:30:47,519 --> 00:30:53,519
9% the only other way is to have more

627
00:30:50,119 --> 00:30:56,239
CO2 at rubisco and so this seemed good

628
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:59,720
evidence that that was what was

629
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:03,000
happening um

630
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:05,558
just mention of course not everything is

631
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:09,000
predictable and I I showed examples

632
00:31:05,558 --> 00:31:13,638
yesterday with pests of soybean one of

633
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:15,960
the other things we see with um and this

634
00:31:13,638 --> 00:31:19,439
was a bit of a shock was that under

635
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:23,558
elevated CO2 and I hope it's apparent

636
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:26,558
there um it the crop is green at the end

637
00:31:23,558 --> 00:31:28,960
of the growing season when it's yellow

638
00:31:26,558 --> 00:31:30,359
outside and um in fact it should have

639
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:33,759
been the other way around because the

640
00:31:30,359 --> 00:31:35,519
crop's warmer heat accelerates

641
00:31:33,759 --> 00:31:37,720
development and it should have gone

642
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:41,079
yellow inside before it was green

643
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:43,558
outside and in fact the the engineer at

644
00:31:41,079 --> 00:31:46,000
the site I was telling him tell me when

645
00:31:43,558 --> 00:31:48,678
it goes yellow inside because I wanted

646
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:51,038
to take a picture of it and I kept

647
00:31:48,679 --> 00:31:54,360
calling him every morning and he said no

648
00:31:51,038 --> 00:31:58,000
no and eventually sheepishly said I

649
00:31:54,359 --> 00:32:00,879
think it's green inside so so I said oh

650
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:03,240
that can't be possible so I went out

651
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:07,399
there and sure enough it was green

652
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:09,519
inside the ring and yellow outside so so

653
00:32:07,398 --> 00:32:11,119
by boosting photosynthesis and

654
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:14,079
carbohydrate

655
00:32:11,119 --> 00:32:17,359
Supply it appears that we've delayed s

656
00:32:14,079 --> 00:32:19,398
essence of of the crop because this crop

657
00:32:17,359 --> 00:32:21,678
is genetically identical you can see

658
00:32:19,398 --> 00:32:26,278
it's all in the same

659
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:28,399
field um now this was very intriguing

660
00:32:26,278 --> 00:32:31,839
because what we then found was

661
00:32:28,398 --> 00:32:34,759
these are the TR these are the wild type

662
00:32:31,839 --> 00:32:37,000
soybean same generation as these ones

663
00:32:34,759 --> 00:32:40,398
which were transformed and at the end of

664
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:42,398
the season boosting photosynthesis

665
00:32:40,398 --> 00:32:46,599
appeared to delay

666
00:32:42,398 --> 00:32:49,558
sence so that was another very

667
00:32:46,599 --> 00:32:52,038
interesting parallel they these trans

668
00:32:49,558 --> 00:32:56,000
transgenic plants appeared just like the

669
00:32:52,038 --> 00:32:56,000
wild type ones give them more

670
00:32:56,599 --> 00:32:59,839
CO2 um

671
00:33:01,038 --> 00:33:06,558
sorry I I move on from this but one of

672
00:33:03,839 --> 00:33:09,759
the ways which we could adapt the plant

673
00:33:06,558 --> 00:33:15,319
to Rising CO2 is exactly around this

674
00:33:09,759 --> 00:33:16,759
issue of rubisco that if we um look at

675
00:33:15,319 --> 00:33:19,319
the response of

676
00:33:16,759 --> 00:33:22,038
photosynthesis to the CO2 inside the

677
00:33:19,319 --> 00:33:25,839
leaf so we're eliminating a statal

678
00:33:22,038 --> 00:33:29,720
effect in this diagram what we see is

679
00:33:25,839 --> 00:33:32,480
that as we increase C 2 photosynthesis

680
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:35,278
increases rapidly then it reaches a

681
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:37,798
transition point where it rises more

682
00:33:35,278 --> 00:33:41,398
slowly what is happening here is that

683
00:33:37,798 --> 00:33:43,319
you're saturating the carboxilate

684
00:33:41,398 --> 00:33:46,798
reaction of

685
00:33:43,319 --> 00:33:49,480
rubisco and um then when you get to this

686
00:33:46,798 --> 00:33:50,879
point you now become limited by the

687
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:54,360
supply of

688
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:57,799
rubp not directly by the supply of

689
00:33:54,359 --> 00:34:01,038
CO2 but not sure how I've managed to do

690
00:33:57,798 --> 00:34:01,038
do that

691
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:09,079
um good so um so but you can see there's

692
00:34:06,519 --> 00:34:11,838
still a rise here and the reason for

693
00:34:09,079 --> 00:34:14,919
this is although rubp is limiting

694
00:34:11,838 --> 00:34:17,279
because you're increasing CO2 you're

695
00:34:14,918 --> 00:34:20,000
progressively inhibiting the oxygenation

696
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:24,040
reaction so more of that limiting supply

697
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:26,119
of ubp is being used in photosynthesis

698
00:34:24,039 --> 00:34:29,398
un Less in

699
00:34:26,119 --> 00:34:32,358
photorespiration now if we

700
00:34:29,398 --> 00:34:34,239
um what we tend to find is that current

701
00:34:32,358 --> 00:34:38,960
CO2

702
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:41,199
levels so if at a given stomatal

703
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:43,000
conductance what'll happen is as we

704
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:45,398
increase

705
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:48,079
photosynthesis the CO2 concentration

706
00:34:45,398 --> 00:34:50,838
inside the leaf will drop because

707
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:54,960
photosynthesis is removing CO2 the

708
00:34:50,838 --> 00:34:57,880
stomates are limiting that CO2 so inside

709
00:34:54,960 --> 00:35:00,159
the leaf you have lower CO2 than out

710
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:02,960
side at this point inside and outside

711
00:35:00,159 --> 00:35:06,039
are the same and what we typically find

712
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:08,679
this point the operating point is very

713
00:35:06,039 --> 00:35:11,199
close to this transition and that makes

714
00:35:08,679 --> 00:35:15,358
sense the leaf has optimized its

715
00:35:11,199 --> 00:35:16,480
investment in rubisco versus apparatus

716
00:35:15,358 --> 00:35:19,159
for

717
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:22,159
regenerating um

718
00:35:19,159 --> 00:35:25,920
ubp but now if we move out to an

719
00:35:22,159 --> 00:35:30,879
elevated CO2 situation we've unbalanced

720
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:33,519
this that we we've now got um we've got

721
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:36,519
far more rubisco than we need and we're

722
00:35:33,519 --> 00:35:38,199
limited entirely by the apparatus for

723
00:35:36,519 --> 00:35:41,800
regeneration of

724
00:35:38,199 --> 00:35:44,239
rubp So in theory what we could do is we

725
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:46,880
could decrease

726
00:35:44,239 --> 00:35:49,639
rubisco and if you like we could have

727
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:51,200
the same photosynthetic rate but be more

728
00:35:49,639 --> 00:35:54,159
nitrogen use

729
00:35:51,199 --> 00:35:57,719
efficient cuz rabisco is about

730
00:35:54,159 --> 00:36:01,000
25% of the nitrogen in the leaf so it's

731
00:35:57,719 --> 00:36:03,719
a lot of nitrogen or we could use that

732
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:05,559
resource instead to increase capacity

733
00:36:03,719 --> 00:36:08,759
for regeneration of

734
00:36:05,559 --> 00:36:12,759
ubp and have for the same amount of

735
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:15,400
nitrogen have even more CO2 fixed now of

736
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:17,720
course a question you might ask is well

737
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:20,838
does the plant know this if you grow it

738
00:36:17,719 --> 00:36:23,399
under elevated CO2 does it acclimate in

739
00:36:20,838 --> 00:36:26,199
this way

740
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:29,920
um and these are data that carbonaki

741
00:36:26,199 --> 00:36:32,519
took during his PhD work where indeed

742
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:34,960
the plant seems to know a little bit of

743
00:36:32,519 --> 00:36:37,318
this and what he found was there was a

744
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:39,519
decrease in this initial slope and a

745
00:36:37,318 --> 00:36:42,039
slight rise in the plateau but it was

746
00:36:39,519 --> 00:36:44,480
nowhere near enough to reach the

747
00:36:42,039 --> 00:36:48,599
theoretical

748
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:53,079
gain um so yeah I

749
00:36:48,599 --> 00:36:55,119
should so um so one of the other things

750
00:36:53,079 --> 00:36:58,960
we looked at was this issue of

751
00:36:55,119 --> 00:37:00,760
regeneration and Jing wanu who was a

752
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:03,280
graduate student in the lab at the same

753
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:05,240
time as Carl uh worked with me on

754
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:07,960
developing a complete model of

755
00:37:05,239 --> 00:37:10,318
photosynthesis where we represented the

756
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:11,599
whole system by a series of Link

757
00:37:10,318 --> 00:37:13,838
differential

758
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:16,079
equations that we eventually got to

759
00:37:13,838 --> 00:37:19,838
replicate what the leaf was doing in

760
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:24,039
terms of CO2 uptake in in

761
00:37:19,838 --> 00:37:27,679
Vivo um and this just shows some of the

762
00:37:24,039 --> 00:37:29,000
uh classic responses we see if you like

763
00:37:27,679 --> 00:37:31,279
in one of these

764
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:33,920
cuetes uh this just shows that we could

765
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:36,480
simulate these responses with with the

766
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:39,480
model so these Dynamic

767
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:41,119
responses um we could then use the

768
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:42,639
system to

769
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:46,240
basically

770
00:37:42,639 --> 00:37:48,078
optimize investment so we could say well

771
00:37:46,239 --> 00:37:50,759
apply if you like an evolutionary

772
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:54,079
algorithm to say okay where should we be

773
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:56,400
investing to regenerate IP more

774
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:59,920
efficiently and it picked out in

775
00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:01,838
particular this one enzyme sbpa but

776
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:06,440
there are a number of other changes it's

777
00:38:01,838 --> 00:38:08,960
suggested fbpa as well fbp outlays all

778
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:11,200
of which we're now looking at in uh

779
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:13,880
particularly in tobacco but probably

780
00:38:11,199 --> 00:38:16,719
will test in soybean and my colleague

781
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:18,559
Christine Reigns in England uh did this

782
00:38:16,719 --> 00:38:21,239
with tobacco here are plants in the

783
00:38:18,559 --> 00:38:24,960
glass house we put those out in our soy

784
00:38:21,239 --> 00:38:26,039
face experiment and could replicated in

785
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:28,679
in the

786
00:38:26,039 --> 00:38:31,079
field um one of the things we found

787
00:38:28,679 --> 00:38:34,519
though was that and I'll skip over this

788
00:38:31,079 --> 00:38:38,039
was that under elevated CO2 the response

789
00:38:34,519 --> 00:38:39,960
was even greater and that got us

790
00:38:38,039 --> 00:38:42,400
intrigued um you know and of course it

791
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:46,760
fits in with the theory I showed you

792
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:49,559
that it should be greater under elevated

793
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:52,160
CO2 so one of the other things we did

794
00:38:49,559 --> 00:38:55,960
went back to with the model was to say

795
00:38:52,159 --> 00:38:58,199
well it was curious that sbpa is a

796
00:38:55,960 --> 00:39:00,400
really very small amount of the to total

797
00:38:58,199 --> 00:39:02,399
protein in the leaf it would be in

798
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:06,519
theory it be very easy for a plant to

799
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:10,280
evolve more sbas at a very low

800
00:39:06,519 --> 00:39:13,480
cost so we reran the model at 220 parts

801
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:16,519
per per million per billion per million

802
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:20,719
sorry the concentration under which we

803
00:39:16,519 --> 00:39:25,119
think the crop ancestors evolved and we

804
00:39:20,719 --> 00:39:27,719
sorry we looked at a flux control in

805
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:31,720
this was in the model and it suggested

806
00:39:27,719 --> 00:39:35,358
well s Spas would invert in would have

807
00:39:31,719 --> 00:39:38,239
no control over CO2 fixation under those

808
00:39:35,358 --> 00:39:41,519
conditions but at

809
00:39:38,239 --> 00:39:44,719
390 PPM it would have a strong control

810
00:39:41,519 --> 00:39:47,920
at 700 it would be even more and rubisa

811
00:39:44,719 --> 00:39:50,399
would be moving in the opposite

812
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:52,838
direction so that was consistent with

813
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:56,119
what we saw in these

814
00:39:52,838 --> 00:39:57,880
experiments um I just very briefly

815
00:39:56,119 --> 00:40:00,480
mentioned this but

816
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:02,760
another thing that we also have done

817
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:05,800
with modeling is rubisco appears to have

818
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:09,280
a tradeoff that this

819
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:12,760
specificity um factor I

820
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:15,839
where plant if you like we think that

821
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:18,839
plants have evolved to become very

822
00:40:15,838 --> 00:40:22,039
obviously very specific for CO2 against

823
00:40:18,838 --> 00:40:24,358
a very strong oxygen background so that

824
00:40:22,039 --> 00:40:29,119
we find that crop plants tend to have a

825
00:40:24,358 --> 00:40:32,239
specificity of 90 in in favor of CO2 but

826
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:35,880
as you go out to C4 plants where the

827
00:40:32,239 --> 00:40:38,519
rubisco is in a high CO2 environment or

828
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:41,920
bacteria where they might be in anerobic

829
00:40:38,519 --> 00:40:43,480
environments specificity drops but

830
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:47,559
catalytic rate

831
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:49,119
increases so the thinking is that to get

832
00:40:47,559 --> 00:40:52,639
tighter

833
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:56,760
binding um catalytic rate has to drop so

834
00:40:52,639 --> 00:41:01,559
there's a tradeoff and to cut a short a

835
00:40:56,760 --> 00:41:04,560
long story short what we found was that

836
00:41:01,559 --> 00:41:07,920
um you there should be an Optimum at any

837
00:41:04,559 --> 00:41:10,679
CO2 concentration what we found was that

838
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:13,960
that Optimum was a specificity of about

839
00:41:10,679 --> 00:41:18,118
90 a pre-ind uh

840
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:20,760
rather the 220 PPM in which the plants

841
00:41:18,119 --> 00:41:24,039
probably evolved but today it's much

842
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:26,640
lower so there'd be a big advantage in

843
00:41:24,039 --> 00:41:29,199
if you like getting in a foreign rubisco

844
00:41:26,639 --> 00:41:30,559
which might have lower specificity but a

845
00:41:29,199 --> 00:41:33,439
higher

846
00:41:30,559 --> 00:41:37,880
Kat and indeed we we modeled this

847
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:40,599
amaranthus Ulus rabisco which is C4

848
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:43,480
actually fits these specs and in the

849
00:41:40,599 --> 00:41:45,000
model it would give you about a 70% gain

850
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:47,838
for no increase in

851
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:49,239
nitrogen if you could replace the lower

852
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:51,599
canopy

853
00:41:49,239 --> 00:41:55,358
rubisco um

854
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:57,880
with um a further different rubisco you

855
00:41:55,358 --> 00:41:59,559
could get up to 30% gain

856
00:41:57,880 --> 00:42:03,039
well when we did that that all seemed a

857
00:41:59,559 --> 00:42:05,920
bit a pie in the sky because rubiscos

858
00:42:03,039 --> 00:42:09,440
coded for in both the plasted and the

859
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:13,200
nucleus extremely difficult to put into

860
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:15,519
higher plants but this is a picture from

861
00:42:13,199 --> 00:42:19,000
the paper in nature from Morin's group

862
00:42:15,519 --> 00:42:20,719
and Martin par and rothamstead where

863
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:24,318
they've really shown you can take very

864
00:42:20,719 --> 00:42:25,919
distant rubiscos get them into tobacco

865
00:42:24,318 --> 00:42:29,639
and at least you can get the plants to

866
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:32,039
survive to to flowering so so these

867
00:42:29,639 --> 00:42:34,239
things are becoming as the technology

868
00:42:32,039 --> 00:42:36,239
moves forward these things are becoming

869
00:42:34,239 --> 00:42:38,318
more and more

870
00:42:36,239 --> 00:42:40,679
possible finally I just wanted to sort

871
00:42:38,318 --> 00:42:43,000
of point out you can also apply this

872
00:42:40,679 --> 00:42:46,358
type of evolutionary algorithm at the

873
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:49,358
canopy level and Darren Drury working

874
00:42:46,358 --> 00:42:52,920
with me as a postto did this with again

875
00:42:49,358 --> 00:42:55,159
soybean canopies and I won't go into all

876
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:57,960
the details of this but basically what

877
00:42:55,159 --> 00:43:00,838
he showed was that you could

878
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:03,559
by changing canopy Leaf

879
00:43:00,838 --> 00:43:06,440
reflectivity the angles of the leaves

880
00:43:03,559 --> 00:43:09,319
optimizing those and also the number of

881
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:12,760
leaves you could get quite a significant

882
00:43:09,318 --> 00:43:15,318
gain in carbon uptake you could also for

883
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:18,800
warmer environments you could cool the

884
00:43:15,318 --> 00:43:20,639
canopy as well and so and we know now

885
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:23,880
some of the genes for example that

886
00:43:20,639 --> 00:43:26,639
determine hinging of leaves so these

887
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:29,039
things are becoming possibilities we can

888
00:43:26,639 --> 00:43:31,400
tie them in with phytochrome

889
00:43:29,039 --> 00:43:33,599
responses promoters for phytochrome

890
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:35,680
responses so they do a different thing

891
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:38,280
at the top of the canopy to the bottom

892
00:43:35,679 --> 00:43:42,598
of the canopy now one of the things it

893
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:46,519
predicted was that actually soybeans

894
00:43:42,599 --> 00:43:48,880
produced too many leaves that if if they

895
00:43:46,519 --> 00:43:51,559
invested in fewer leaves you would get

896
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:54,680
more gain and so of course we were

897
00:43:51,559 --> 00:43:57,760
thinking of what

898
00:43:54,679 --> 00:44:02,799
um what genotype might be available in

899
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:04,480
which we could test this um vat the

900
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:06,400
graduate student who was working with us

901
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:09,760
at the time was an engineer he'd done

902
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:12,280
the modeling so he wasn't in on the

903
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:14,680
conversations we had about

904
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:18,480
genotypes instead he started an

905
00:44:14,679 --> 00:44:22,558
replicated experiment in the field where

906
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:25,159
he cut off every um fourth emerging

907
00:44:22,559 --> 00:44:27,720
Leaf uh so that he was preventing the

908
00:44:25,159 --> 00:44:30,920
plant from investing in

909
00:44:27,719 --> 00:44:33,558
these extra leaves and what he found was

910
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:36,000
that sorry every third developing Leaf

911
00:44:33,559 --> 00:44:38,400
what he got was a significant 10%

912
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:41,079
increase in yield there seem to be two

913
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:44,318
reasons for that one is that the canopy

914
00:44:41,079 --> 00:44:47,480
actually has more lit more leaves than

915
00:44:44,318 --> 00:44:50,199
it really needs so it's it's respiratory

916
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:53,159
load by having extra leaves actually

917
00:44:50,199 --> 00:44:56,318
outweighs the gain of more leaves but of

918
00:44:53,159 --> 00:44:57,679
course in an evolutionary sense this

919
00:44:56,318 --> 00:44:59,920
might be beneficial icial because you

920
00:44:57,679 --> 00:45:01,558
never know when a herbivore is going to

921
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:03,480
come along and remove half of what

922
00:45:01,559 --> 00:45:06,160
you've got

923
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:08,358
um but in the farmers's field is a

924
00:45:06,159 --> 00:45:10,838
disadvantage the other is by cutting

925
00:45:08,358 --> 00:45:13,119
them off early you prevent the plant

926
00:45:10,838 --> 00:45:16,440
from investing resource in that

927
00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:18,318
developing leaf and it resulted in a an

928
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:20,838
increase in yield and we've done that

929
00:45:18,318 --> 00:45:24,920
two years running now

930
00:45:20,838 --> 00:45:27,880
um so it's involves quite a lot of

931
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:30,960
undergraduate time as well but

932
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:33,119
but um he also we we had a filled

933
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:35,280
assimilation chamber where we could

934
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:38,200
actually test out the idea that it

935
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:42,760
really is resulting in a higher net CO2

936
00:45:38,199 --> 00:45:45,679
uptake as well as a high yield so as I

937
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:47,720
mentioned yesterday we with Gates

938
00:45:45,679 --> 00:45:50,279
Foundation funding we've now got an a

939
00:45:47,719 --> 00:45:50,959
chance to test many of these ideas in

940
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:55,680
the

941
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:58,079
field um and so to

942
00:45:55,679 --> 00:46:00,558
summarize I think there is a very

943
00:45:58,079 --> 00:46:02,200
serious problem that we're potentially

944
00:46:00,559 --> 00:46:03,319
going to have a shortfall in primary

945
00:46:02,199 --> 00:46:05,719
food

946
00:46:03,318 --> 00:46:08,358
stuffs there you know there are

947
00:46:05,719 --> 00:46:11,118
arguments against that but I don't think

948
00:46:08,358 --> 00:46:13,920
we should be taking chances we should

949
00:46:11,119 --> 00:46:16,720
prepare we should be ensuring ourselves

950
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:17,680
against an uncertain future both in

951
00:46:16,719 --> 00:46:21,558
human

952
00:46:17,679 --> 00:46:24,480
behavior um and in climate driven by

953
00:46:21,559 --> 00:46:27,359
that um

954
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:31,119
the the potential yield increases of

955
00:46:27,358 --> 00:46:34,400
rising CO2 are not fully realized in our

956
00:46:31,119 --> 00:46:37,838
current crops but there are genetic and

957
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:41,039
biotech Solutions although fil

958
00:46:37,838 --> 00:46:44,400
facilities are seriously lacking to do

959
00:46:41,039 --> 00:46:46,920
that and we're just not willing to spend

960
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:49,559
what we need to spend on on those field

961
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:51,960
facilities which which would be a tiny

962
00:46:49,559 --> 00:46:55,680
fraction of the cost we're putting into

963
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:58,760
other things doe just spent 100 million

964
00:46:55,679 --> 00:47:02,480
near us in into the deep rocks to see if

965
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:05,240
it could capture a small amount of CO2

966
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:08,559
that that would be enough to pay for

967
00:47:05,239 --> 00:47:11,318
breeding facilities at least three sites

968
00:47:08,559 --> 00:47:14,880
around the country to actually adapt to

969
00:47:11,318 --> 00:47:17,318
these problems and just again finish by

970
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:19,318
thanking all the people who've made this

971
00:47:17,318 --> 00:47:22,440
possible particular I should mention

972
00:47:19,318 --> 00:47:25,519
this is Yin wanu and Donal my colleague

973
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:29,200
has worked closely with me um Lisa

974
00:47:25,519 --> 00:47:30,838
rinworth and Andrew leaky have mentioned

975
00:47:29,199 --> 00:47:33,558
as well and

976
00:47:30,838 --> 00:47:36,078
uh so Carl is somewhere in these

977
00:47:33,559 --> 00:47:37,680
pictures but with that our finish and

978
00:47:36,079 --> 00:47:42,240
thank you for your
