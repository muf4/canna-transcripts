1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,339
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:04,339
University

3
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:12,220
grab so I thought I'd get asked a lot

4
00:00:10,359 --> 00:00:14,679
about you know how long does it take to

5
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:16,269
get a variety out you know what is the

6
00:00:14,679 --> 00:00:17,620
process so I thought I'd walk you

7
00:00:16,269 --> 00:00:20,259
through what we did with Archer my

8
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:22,300
newest strawberry and it is it can be a

9
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:24,340
long process so the archer was a

10
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:26,769
selection I made very early in my career

11
00:00:24,339 --> 00:00:29,050
here at Cornell and it was done very

12
00:00:26,769 --> 00:00:31,329
much in the traditional sense of things

13
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:33,340
and so you'll see every step was done

14
00:00:31,329 --> 00:00:35,619
through the field on a year-by-year

15
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:37,120
basis and it takes a long time doing it

16
00:00:35,619 --> 00:00:39,038
that way so we've got some strategies

17
00:00:37,119 --> 00:00:41,558
we've worked on and we'll talk about how

18
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:43,870
we've been speeding that up but this is

19
00:00:41,558 --> 00:00:46,738
how Archer started so in 99 we made some

20
00:00:43,869 --> 00:00:48,908
some crosses made some hybridizations I

21
00:00:46,738 --> 00:00:50,498
didn't have a lot of information to go

22
00:00:48,908 --> 00:00:52,719
on I hadn't worked on berries for very

23
00:00:50,499 --> 00:00:54,909
long but we had the records from my

24
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:57,399
patent from the past breeder and we made

25
00:00:54,908 --> 00:00:58,960
some crosses collected the seed in two

26
00:00:57,399 --> 00:01:02,228
thousand that seed got treating got

27
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:04,210
planted out into the field you just grow

28
00:01:02,228 --> 00:01:07,060
them in the field so we planted them in

29
00:01:04,209 --> 00:01:09,609
rows and let them grow those have to

30
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:14,049
grow a year go through winter the next

31
00:01:09,609 --> 00:01:15,519
spring we get to see fruit now we've

32
00:01:14,049 --> 00:01:17,380
cleaned that up a little bit we use

33
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:19,118
plastic we put them on plastic to help

34
00:01:17,379 --> 00:01:20,438
with weed control but the process is

35
00:01:19,118 --> 00:01:22,420
generally the same we put them in the

36
00:01:20,438 --> 00:01:26,349
ground one spring the next spring we get

37
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:27,700
to see fruit helps as well we use a

38
00:01:26,349 --> 00:01:29,109
little bit of raised beds when you get a

39
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:30,759
lot of water this year that didn't

40
00:01:29,109 --> 00:01:33,218
happen but last year we had water it was

41
00:01:30,759 --> 00:01:35,349
so high it wet almost over the beds so

42
00:01:33,218 --> 00:01:37,959
from some years we get a lot of rain and

43
00:01:35,349 --> 00:01:42,938
some years yet none but you can't know

44
00:01:37,959 --> 00:01:45,569
that in advance so in 2001 we made the

45
00:01:42,938 --> 00:01:48,339
selection so this is a 2001 selection I

46
00:01:45,569 --> 00:01:50,169
made some notes that day when I selected

47
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:51,340
it it's a huge king very often the

48
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:52,989
primary barrier that comes off of

49
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:56,560
strawberry in the industry they'll call

50
00:01:52,989 --> 00:01:59,048
it the King berry I put very large q

51
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,368
well I use the term queen berry as well

52
00:01:59,049 --> 00:02:02,409
rather than secondary because it's

53
00:02:00,368 --> 00:02:05,769
easier to write but that's not generally

54
00:02:02,409 --> 00:02:07,450
used in the industry and I wrote that it

55
00:02:05,769 --> 00:02:09,460
was firm dat good interior color good

56
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:12,009
flavor tart that's what I had to go on I

57
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:14,650
made some notes that day and I picked

58
00:02:12,009 --> 00:02:16,658
three fruit a primary barrier she a

59
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:18,370
secondary barrier in a tertiary very you

60
00:02:16,658 --> 00:02:21,098
add those up it's almost a hundred grams

61
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:22,420
of fruit so I calculated if you took a

62
00:02:21,098 --> 00:02:24,759
hundred grams of fruit which is only

63
00:02:22,419 --> 00:02:26,979
three berries per plant on a per acre

64
00:02:24,759 --> 00:02:29,169
basis that's over four thousand pounds

65
00:02:26,979 --> 00:02:31,750
each plant produces more than three

66
00:02:29,169 --> 00:02:32,979
fruit so this is the kind of thing when

67
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:34,750
we see this kind of thing we're like it

68
00:02:32,979 --> 00:02:36,429
wow we got yield right away because we

69
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:38,019
got a lot of fruit size it comes off

70
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:40,390
very quickly and it comes off at once

71
00:02:38,019 --> 00:02:43,509
and for us to have a tertiary Barry and

72
00:02:40,389 --> 00:02:46,059
the 16 grams eyes is a very good berry

73
00:02:43,509 --> 00:02:49,090
in the marketplace 25 will get you about

74
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:51,459
this big 50 50 50 grams will be about

75
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:53,140
the size of a plum it's a very large

76
00:02:51,459 --> 00:02:56,170
berry that's larger than what you

77
00:02:53,139 --> 00:02:58,208
normally see we like we'll pick berries

78
00:02:56,169 --> 00:03:01,389
down to about 8 to 10 grams is

79
00:02:58,209 --> 00:03:03,939
acceptable for a commercial product so

80
00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:05,738
that year we had one plant that's all

81
00:03:03,939 --> 00:03:08,049
there is is one plant from that one seed

82
00:03:05,739 --> 00:03:09,810
so whatever runners it produced we

83
00:03:08,049 --> 00:03:11,890
collected those runners routed them and

84
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:13,750
start and when there's a picture from

85
00:03:11,889 --> 00:03:15,219
that first plant they're not the

86
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:16,658
prettiest things i'm out there holding

87
00:03:15,219 --> 00:03:19,180
them with one hand taking a picture with

88
00:03:16,658 --> 00:03:21,489
the other so it's really not i'm not a

89
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:23,230
photographer but it's for me it gets

90
00:03:21,489 --> 00:03:25,450
into my head so i can look back and say

91
00:03:23,229 --> 00:03:28,298
oh I remember that one and that's what

92
00:03:25,449 --> 00:03:31,899
we do to have a picture of kind of a

93
00:03:28,299 --> 00:03:33,519
record as we go you start a plot but it

94
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:34,688
took a year to make the runners then you

95
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:37,420
plant them again you got to wait another

96
00:03:34,688 --> 00:03:41,078
year before they fruit again so that

97
00:03:37,419 --> 00:03:42,548
takes a year we planted and then we look

98
00:03:41,079 --> 00:03:44,140
at it for two or three years because we

99
00:03:42,549 --> 00:03:45,819
want to see is it going to live it's

100
00:03:44,139 --> 00:03:47,619
going to have some disease that wipes it

101
00:03:45,818 --> 00:03:49,780
out in the first second year it's a

102
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:50,680
fruit going to grow or the plants going

103
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:52,479
to grow or they're going to produce

104
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:54,010
runners so we collect more runners from

105
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:55,649
the next plot and then you plant another

106
00:03:54,009 --> 00:03:57,639
plot and you do it again to make sure

107
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:59,500
because you got a planet in different

108
00:03:57,639 --> 00:04:01,298
locations to make sure you didn't plan

109
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:04,060
it in the best possible location and it

110
00:04:01,299 --> 00:04:05,890
was great but in a bad location it's

111
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:08,438
going to die very quickly so we planted

112
00:04:05,889 --> 00:04:11,369
multiple plots at different locations so

113
00:04:08,438 --> 00:04:13,919
that we can see this over time

114
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:15,299
and then you have to evaluate it for

115
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:17,039
several years to see how it comes

116
00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:18,900
through winter to see how the plants

117
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:21,150
grow will they persist in the field will

118
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:23,250
it have a good yield every year it takes

119
00:04:21,149 --> 00:04:25,439
time to go through this and it can

120
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:28,620
really take a long time and during that

121
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:30,810
way most of the selections gets left off

122
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:32,340
they're found wanting for whatever

123
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:33,569
reason they're susceptible to some

124
00:04:32,339 --> 00:04:35,638
disease they don't produce enough

125
00:04:33,569 --> 00:04:39,509
runners the fruit quality declines over

126
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:41,370
time these are things that you see we

127
00:04:39,509 --> 00:04:43,199
take more pictures so we all make sure

128
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:45,149
we're planting the same plant every time

129
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:46,829
and that when you it produces fruit the

130
00:04:45,149 --> 00:04:48,478
fruit looks like what we think it's

131
00:04:46,829 --> 00:04:50,579
supposed to look like so each time you

132
00:04:48,478 --> 00:04:53,099
each cycle you're taking pictures to

133
00:04:50,579 --> 00:04:54,659
make sure everything is the same at that

134
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:55,889
point we decided these are looking good

135
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:57,720
they're very consistent we're going to

136
00:04:55,889 --> 00:04:59,310
move it into tissue culture because to

137
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:01,530
take it off the station we needs

138
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:03,180
disease-free plants I can't collect

139
00:05:01,529 --> 00:05:05,399
stuff from the field and send it out to

140
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:07,228
growers or to a nursery and it could

141
00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:08,728
have any kind of pathogen on it so we

142
00:05:07,228 --> 00:05:10,560
move it into tissue culture to clean it

143
00:05:08,728 --> 00:05:12,329
up make sure it doesn't have any viruses

144
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:15,030
make sure it doesn't have buy tops or up

145
00:05:12,329 --> 00:05:18,359
verticillium various fungal pathogens

146
00:05:15,029 --> 00:05:20,609
and that takes can take it a few months

147
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:24,919
but it could take a year or more to some

148
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:24,919
some varieties don't tissue culture well

149
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:30,770
so we got plants we have to check in for

150
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:32,000
virus we have to produce more plants so

151
00:05:30,769 --> 00:05:33,769
we can put them back out in the field

152
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,569
make sure tissue culture didn't screw it

153
00:05:33,769 --> 00:05:36,889
up sometimes you put things in tissue

154
00:05:35,569 --> 00:05:38,870
culture what you get out of tissue

155
00:05:36,889 --> 00:05:41,629
culture doesn't look like what you put

156
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:43,370
in and so we have to make sure that we

157
00:05:41,629 --> 00:05:45,050
grow plants make sure they're true to

158
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:47,660
type make sure they look like what you

159
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:50,629
expect them to look like all this takes

160
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:52,790
time and we of course take more pictures

161
00:05:50,629 --> 00:05:54,379
we want to make sure it looks like it's

162
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:56,660
supposed to look like you have to make

163
00:05:54,379 --> 00:05:59,329
sure you have the same product that you

164
00:05:56,660 --> 00:06:01,939
in the end with of what you started with

165
00:05:59,329 --> 00:06:03,800
so we confirmed trueness of type at that

166
00:06:01,939 --> 00:06:05,569
stage we're like okay we got virus free

167
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:07,160
plants let's send it to the nursery so

168
00:06:05,569 --> 00:06:09,469
they can propagate it in large numbers

169
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:14,150
that way we can get it to some of the

170
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:16,610
growers so in 2014 we sent out sixteen

171
00:06:14,149 --> 00:06:18,679
thousand plus plants to different 11

172
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:20,810
growers across the state so they could

173
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:24,650
grow it in a large scale and give me

174
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:26,000
some feedback on how how it looks for

175
00:06:24,649 --> 00:06:28,759
them how does it look in a commercial

176
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,100
setting up to that point we had 25-foot

177
00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:32,810
plots at the biggest you know so now

178
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:34,520
they get a thousand plants or two

179
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:36,560
thousand plants and you can see it on a

180
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:41,120
van a core a quarter of an acre and

181
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:43,490
actually see it in a large scale they

182
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:45,019
evaluated the first year they evaluate

183
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:47,300
it again the second year if you want to

184
00:06:45,019 --> 00:06:48,769
sit most of the growers will grow it in

185
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:52,129
a perennial setting and they want to see

186
00:06:48,769 --> 00:06:54,709
it more than one year so all this takes

187
00:06:52,129 --> 00:06:56,540
15 years we get to this point and we're

188
00:06:54,709 --> 00:06:58,879
finally okay it's time to release it and

189
00:06:56,540 --> 00:07:00,470
you're here today it's being released

190
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:03,019
today it's being announced so it is

191
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:06,290
available to growers now they won't plan

192
00:07:03,019 --> 00:07:08,419
it until next year but of course we're

193
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:12,660
taking pictures all along to make sure

194
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:15,660
that it's the same thing question

195
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:15,660
yes

196
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:21,520
so what the growers will pay what the

197
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:24,069
growers will do or what the nursery will

198
00:07:21,519 --> 00:07:27,339
charge the propagation fee so that the

199
00:07:24,069 --> 00:07:31,839
cost of propagation is offset so it is

200
00:07:27,339 --> 00:07:34,179
not the same price that is its we're not

201
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:37,629
selling the plants they're offsetting

202
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:40,900
the cost of propagation it's a semantics

203
00:07:37,629 --> 00:07:44,230
but it is not available to commercial

204
00:07:40,899 --> 00:07:45,909
growers in this kate was only available

205
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:47,319
to growers of the New York State berry

206
00:07:45,910 --> 00:07:48,970
Growers Association through a

207
00:07:47,319 --> 00:07:50,500
cooperative agreement with Cornell

208
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:53,290
University that we have with the

209
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:55,629
Association so we didn't send it to just

210
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:57,640
any growers we sent it to growers who

211
00:07:55,629 --> 00:08:00,579
were part of this organization that we

212
00:07:57,639 --> 00:08:03,279
had a contract with for doing the

213
00:08:00,579 --> 00:08:04,839
testing and so this was this year this

214
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:07,509
is fruit I got from a commercial grower

215
00:08:04,839 --> 00:08:09,819
it looked great he was happy with it we

216
00:08:07,509 --> 00:08:11,680
moved forward so that it's now going to

217
00:08:09,819 --> 00:08:15,730
be available and they will plant the

218
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:18,670
first commercial crop this coming spring

219
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:21,879
in 2017 of course we won't see that

220
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:24,009
fruit until 2018 so again there's time

221
00:08:21,879 --> 00:08:26,500
every time you have to grow the plant so

222
00:08:24,009 --> 00:08:29,610
it can really take a long time to get

223
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:29,610
through it so how do we

224
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:38,379
this has been a production of Cornell

225
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:38,379
University on the web at cornell edu
