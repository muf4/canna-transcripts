1
00:00:01,159 --> 00:00:04,759
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:12,798
University glad to have you all here at

3
00:00:09,839 --> 00:00:15,399
the 13th annual Cornell corteva plant

4
00:00:12,798 --> 00:00:16,719
breeding Symposium I know this Symposium

5
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:18,278
has been the highlight for a lot of

6
00:00:16,719 --> 00:00:20,919
plant breeding graduate students here at

7
00:00:18,278 --> 00:00:23,240
Cornell over the years and we're so glad

8
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:27,279
that um we get to be part of the the

9
00:00:23,239 --> 00:00:29,518
larger CA symposia series every year our

10
00:00:27,278 --> 00:00:32,200
plant breeding graduate um student

11
00:00:29,518 --> 00:00:35,199
organization synapsis gets to vote on

12
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:37,040
what our theme is and this year we chose

13
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,000
something that was you know relevant to

14
00:00:37,039 --> 00:00:41,519
our students and that they thought was

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,640
important this year our topic is plant

16
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:46,800
breeding for novel systems and complex

17
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,878
problems we hope that this Symposium

18
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:50,519
will highlight some of the examples of

19
00:00:48,878 --> 00:00:52,519
how plant breeders are using

20
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:54,520
out-of-the-box approaches or Cutting

21
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:57,520
Edge methods to adapt crops to Unique

22
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:57,520
Systems

23
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:06,079
this Symposium would not be possible

24
00:01:03,079 --> 00:01:07,879
without um this synapsis Symposium

25
00:01:06,079 --> 00:01:10,438
planning committee I'd like to take a

26
00:01:07,879 --> 00:01:12,319
moment to thank my co-chair Sam um and

27
00:01:10,438 --> 00:01:14,399
also our other committee members Tim

28
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:16,279
basat and Shri who unfortunately

29
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,200
couldn't be here today if throughout the

30
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:19,599
Symposium you have any questions you can

31
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:23,040
try to find one of us and we'll try to

32
00:01:19,599 --> 00:01:24,798
help you I'd also like to thank um

33
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,680
Cornell for their continued support of

34
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:30,479
this Symposium and also bti for hosting

35
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:32,640
us again and then of course corta for

36
00:01:30,478 --> 00:01:34,200
founding the series and continuing to

37
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,159
fund us and support

38
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:38,159
us I want to thank the organizing

39
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:39,118
committee for inviting me to come speak

40
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:41,960
um I've been involved with the

41
00:01:39,118 --> 00:01:43,799
University of Minnesota's uh Symposium

42
00:01:41,959 --> 00:01:46,280
series for three years so it's really a

43
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:47,960
full circle to be invited speaker here

44
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:49,560
um my talk today will be a little bit

45
00:01:47,959 --> 00:01:51,798
different than some many others in the

46
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:54,200
fact that this is volunteer work that

47
00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:58,560
myself and a large team of graduate

48
00:01:54,200 --> 00:02:00,200
students have done and so this is just

49
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,240
some of the names of the second and

50
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:04,320
third cohort of our group um really want

51
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:06,239
to emphasize that this is a team based

52
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:08,439
activity a little bit of background

53
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:11,479
about where is the need where the

54
00:02:08,439 --> 00:02:13,878
objective of our group and so in 2016

55
00:02:11,479 --> 00:02:16,119
this article was published about uh

56
00:02:13,878 --> 00:02:18,280
Minneapolis Farmers Market I might let

57
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:19,878
you guys read the first quote there um

58
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:22,439
and I would summarize in saying that

59
00:02:19,878 --> 00:02:24,560
there is a large need for these

60
00:02:22,439 --> 00:02:26,800
traditional African vegetables that

61
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:30,319
there are community members driving up

62
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:32,800
to eight hours away for these specific

63
00:02:30,318 --> 00:02:34,079
vegetables and even then they're not

64
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,800
getting everything that they have

65
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:39,239
they're running out on time and so I

66
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,959
might pose a question to you if you move

67
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:43,239
to a new country what would you do if

68
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:46,039
you could not find broccoli or carrots

69
00:02:43,239 --> 00:02:47,560
you could adapt to the local cultural

70
00:02:46,039 --> 00:02:50,679
vegetables or maybe you could bring your

71
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:52,560
own vegetables here and so I might pose

72
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:54,840
the greater question to the group here

73
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:57,239
are we as plant breeders are you all as

74
00:02:54,840 --> 00:03:00,680
PL plant beers meeting the needs and

75
00:02:57,239 --> 00:03:03,759
demands in a more socially Equitable way

76
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:06,920
and so to give a little background about

77
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:10,598
uh where we are in Minnesota as a whole

78
00:03:06,919 --> 00:03:12,518
um within Minnesota around 9% of the

79
00:03:10,598 --> 00:03:14,518
residents were not born in the United

80
00:03:12,519 --> 00:03:17,519
States uh most of those live within the

81
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:20,000
Twin Cities and of those around 150,000

82
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:22,120
list Africa as a region of origin and so

83
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,000
our group really focusing on West and

84
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:27,239
East Africa uh communities from these

85
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,479
regions and within

86
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:32,039
the pie chart up here I might highight

87
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:35,679
we have large populations within Twin

88
00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:37,798
Cities from Nigeria Liberia more in the

89
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:39,719
West Africa more in East Africa Kenya

90
00:03:37,799 --> 00:03:41,920
and Somalia and this figure on the

91
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:44,639
bottom just shows that over time within

92
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:47,559
the last recent five 10 years the

93
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:49,839
proportion of uh foreign born people

94
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:53,479
within Minnesota from Africa is really

95
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:56,079
increasing increasing the most and so to

96
00:03:53,479 --> 00:03:58,039
introduce our team uh our main mission

97
00:03:56,079 --> 00:04:00,480
is to bring together researchers Growers

98
00:03:58,039 --> 00:04:03,400
and students to developed culturally

99
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:05,119
relevant food plants towards Minnesota

100
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:07,519
um this is a picture of our group of the

101
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:09,000
current iteration the current cohort uh

102
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:12,120
a lot of our group has really been

103
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,438
modeled after scope out of UC Davis this

104
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:16,560
more participatory volunteer work of

105
00:04:14,438 --> 00:04:18,199
graduate students our one of our main

106
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,399
goals is to eventually release

107
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:22,400
culturally relevant vegetables that are

108
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:24,839
specifically adapted to a Minnesota

109
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:28,198
climate so a quarter a shorter growing

110
00:04:24,839 --> 00:04:30,959
season uh cooler evenings cooler Springs

111
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:33,400
and our group was started in 201 21 and

112
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:35,680
this is a picture of it and just to yeah

113
00:04:33,399 --> 00:04:38,319
highlight this is all volunteer

114
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:40,560
work so some of our main collaborators

115
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:42,839
that we uh work with that we have

116
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:45,879
learned in mutual learning environment

117
00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:47,359
um so Chi trosi is our main one he is

118
00:04:45,879 --> 00:04:48,959
with the hen County Master Gardeners

119
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:51,000
that's one of the main counties within

120
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:53,239
the Twin Cities and he is in charge of

121
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,600
the Dei within the Master Gardeners

122
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:58,918
group there um other collaborators

123
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:00,919
highlight would be in gozy Natalie Hol

124
00:04:58,918 --> 00:05:05,359
is with you and exension and Zachary

125
00:05:00,918 --> 00:05:08,359
pagee who runs a uh

126
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:09,560
nonprofit seed production business so we

127
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:12,840
are partnering with them to actually

128
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:14,399
produce seeds to get to the community um

129
00:05:12,839 --> 00:05:16,758
to give a little broad highlight about

130
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:18,679
what participatory plant breeding is or

131
00:05:16,759 --> 00:05:21,560
even in our context what it is so some

132
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:24,280
of the main uh questions would be who

133
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:25,839
defines the breeding goals sometimes the

134
00:05:24,279 --> 00:05:29,318
scientists would sometimes the community

135
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:30,279
would and so in our in our vision of P

136
00:05:29,319 --> 00:05:31,840
plan

137
00:05:30,279 --> 00:05:33,918
um we are not the ones designing the

138
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:36,079
goals we do not know these vegetables

139
00:05:33,918 --> 00:05:38,599
intrinsically and so we're working with

140
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:41,719
not for the community to develop that

141
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:44,000
and so Frank talked about G by E by m we

142
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:46,600
really think about this as G by E by C

143
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,279
so the context the rule that people play

144
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:51,319
Within developing varieties and so our

145
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:53,879
Target environment would be home

146
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:56,600
gardeners or smallscale producers within

147
00:05:53,879 --> 00:05:58,319
the Greater Twin Cities area and just to

148
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:00,000
highlighted more about that context that

149
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:02,759
context can even be subdivided divided

150
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,319
into Regional specificity so we have

151
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:06,280
certain vegetables that depending if

152
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:10,199
you're in East and West Africa the OT

153
00:06:06,279 --> 00:06:13,359
types are quite drastic quite opposing

154
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:14,759
um and then even when you dive down we

155
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:17,000
what we are really doing is more

156
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:18,919
participatory variety selection and so

157
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,279
participatory plant breeding where the

158
00:06:18,918 --> 00:06:22,719
community involved in every step of the

159
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:24,239
breeding program um we're not there yet

160
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:26,720
we're really walking before we are

161
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:29,199
running and so we are screening diverse

162
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:31,599
germplasm we are selecting varieties

163
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:34,439
with either eventual goal to have that

164
00:06:31,598 --> 00:06:36,918
variety have these idiotypes of form a

165
00:06:34,439 --> 00:06:38,879
more traditional breeding Pipeline and

166
00:06:36,918 --> 00:06:40,918
so some of the ways that participatory

167
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:42,839
plant breeding does really well is

168
00:06:40,918 --> 00:06:45,079
really ideal for is in these highly

169
00:06:42,839 --> 00:06:47,079
heterogeneous environments okay home

170
00:06:45,079 --> 00:06:48,439
gardeners within the Twin Cities every

171
00:06:47,079 --> 00:06:50,399
Garden will have a different set of

172
00:06:48,439 --> 00:06:52,639
conditions uh when Advanced Technologies

173
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:55,038
are limited or I might even change that

174
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:56,560
not limited but not want it so a lot of

175
00:06:55,038 --> 00:06:58,800
our communities really do not want

176
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:01,720
hybrid vegetables do not want

177
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:05,199
genetically modif IED in any capacity

178
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:08,000
and lastly to a broad range of

179
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:09,680
stakeholders so when we' our group first

180
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,478
started we did a situational analysis

181
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:14,079
okay where we are what are the

182
00:07:11,478 --> 00:07:15,800
priorities and so in our priority

183
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:18,240
setting we said we really want to focus

184
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:20,160
on leafy greens there are a large number

185
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:22,400
of African vegetables out there there

186
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:24,240
are fruit that have an okay ability to

187
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:25,878
ship there are small grains that should

188
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,720
have a very good ability to ship but we

189
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:28,759
really focus on these leafy greens these

190
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:30,199
vegetables that really need to be

191
00:07:28,759 --> 00:07:32,280
produced locally

192
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:36,240
um that we have seen that need for

193
00:07:32,279 --> 00:07:38,478
within the farmers markets and one of

194
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,199
the ways we did that is look okay are

195
00:07:38,478 --> 00:07:42,519
there existing varieties for some of our

196
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:45,520
species the answer is no you cannot get

197
00:07:42,519 --> 00:07:47,399
these seeds anywhere online in the

198
00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:50,279
US and

199
00:07:47,399 --> 00:07:51,959
so in sort of the context of how they're

200
00:07:50,279 --> 00:07:53,079
used they're always cooked and that's

201
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:55,598
one of the weaknesses that we're trying

202
00:07:53,079 --> 00:07:57,800
to develop uh building our relationships

203
00:07:55,598 --> 00:08:00,279
with homecooks and so looking at the

204
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:02,478
stakeholder preference we hosted several

205
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:05,000
open houses farmer days where really ask

206
00:08:02,478 --> 00:08:06,719
the people these communities what do you

207
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,038
want uh most of this learning is done

208
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,840
through verbal communication and so

209
00:08:09,038 --> 00:08:12,800
these are some of the highlights of what

210
00:08:10,839 --> 00:08:14,839
they are interested in they are not

211
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:17,199
interested in hybrid vegetables they

212
00:08:14,839 --> 00:08:19,239
want to be able to save their own seed

213
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:21,478
they are not interested in generically

214
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:25,478
engineering which most vegetables are

215
00:08:21,478 --> 00:08:27,478
not and this third one here was really

216
00:08:25,478 --> 00:08:29,318
is currently a large challenge for us to

217
00:08:27,478 --> 00:08:31,279
try and overcome there's no IP rights

218
00:08:29,319 --> 00:08:32,918
that you really don't own a cultural

219
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:35,478
staple and so a lot of our work really

220
00:08:32,918 --> 00:08:39,000
aligns close with the open source seed

221
00:08:35,479 --> 00:08:42,120
initiative and lastly quality is much

222
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:44,600
more preferred over yeld that these uh

223
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:46,440
food aspects The Taste the flavor the

224
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:48,800
texture of these vegetables is so

225
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:50,440
intrinsically important and lastly there

226
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:53,399
are greater cultural functions in some

227
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:55,920
of these vegetables on the right up here

228
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:58,679
is bitter Leaf so bitter Leaf is a tree

229
00:08:55,919 --> 00:09:01,240
forming aser uh one of the most bitter

230
00:08:58,679 --> 00:09:03,039
leaves you can ever tast really use in a

231
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:06,159
medicinal

232
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:08,719
way and so what we're trying to bring to

233
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:11,600
the table as student as Volunteers in

234
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:13,278
this Mutual learning aspect uh is that

235
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:15,079
we have access to resources at the

236
00:09:13,278 --> 00:09:17,879
University of Minnesota we have green

237
00:09:15,078 --> 00:09:20,719
houses we have field equipment we have

238
00:09:17,879 --> 00:09:23,078
the space we have the volunteer capacity

239
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:24,720
to really form this as a center and

240
00:09:23,078 --> 00:09:27,078
within the last couple years we had a

241
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:29,399
community garden and a demo Garden on

242
00:09:27,078 --> 00:09:32,359
campus these are in organically managed

243
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:34,440
fields on campus and lastly we have

244
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:37,399
access to genetic material so we talked

245
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:38,880
about before there's really no um in

246
00:09:37,399 --> 00:09:40,879
some instances ability to order these

247
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:42,679
seeds online as researchers we have

248
00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:45,039
access to grin but grin is not available

249
00:09:42,679 --> 00:09:47,000
to general public and so in some ways

250
00:09:45,039 --> 00:09:48,319
we're just serving as a repository to

251
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,839
that

252
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:52,040
seed as well as other sources during

253
00:09:50,839 --> 00:09:55,760
plasant such as the world vegetable

254
00:09:52,039 --> 00:09:57,838
Center in Taiwan and some cases we act

255
00:09:55,759 --> 00:10:00,559
as seed multiplication we had a farmer

256
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:02,279
give to us some African plant seed he

257
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:03,919
actually lost his entire collection and

258
00:10:02,278 --> 00:10:06,838
we still had a backup of that and were

259
00:10:03,919 --> 00:10:08,039
able to rovide him some of that seed and

260
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:10,079
we talked about Mutual learning a little

261
00:10:08,039 --> 00:10:11,599
bit and eventual our eventual goal is to

262
00:10:10,078 --> 00:10:13,239
releas the varing we have come really

263
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:15,079
close with one of our crops called juk

264
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:16,560
Mel but I'll highlight that in a little

265
00:10:15,078 --> 00:10:18,879
bit

266
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:21,119
so going a little bit about how do we

267
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:23,480
get there how do we as volunteers

268
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:25,600
actually accomplish this uh most of this

269
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:29,680
is relationship building relationship

270
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:33,278
building is integral it's slow but it's

271
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:36,039
effective so we in the last four years

272
00:10:33,278 --> 00:10:38,120
we have devoted most 90% of our time on

273
00:10:36,039 --> 00:10:40,319
this relationship building Less on the

274
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:43,120
actual breeding of these vegetables uh

275
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:46,120
most of this is done by Word of Mouth um

276
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:48,278
it is not our place to uh spam out

277
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:50,839
emails to a long list Ser we are

278
00:10:48,278 --> 00:10:52,439
interested in the public that actually

279
00:10:50,839 --> 00:10:57,000
uh the percentage of the communities

280
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:59,279
actually want um to work with us so

281
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,559
within that there's a strong emphasis on

282
00:10:59,278 --> 00:11:03,720
participation of knowledge rich rich

283
00:11:01,559 --> 00:11:07,919
stakeholders and GOI is one of them as

284
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:11,200
well as Chey um and recognizing that a

285
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:13,399
small subet subset do not want our

286
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:15,639
involvement that in the past University

287
00:11:13,399 --> 00:11:17,559
of Minnesota has misappropriated some

288
00:11:15,639 --> 00:11:20,399
species and that that resentment is very

289
00:11:17,559 --> 00:11:22,039
real and so we are working with the

290
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:23,639
communities that are interested in

291
00:11:22,039 --> 00:11:25,838
working with

292
00:11:23,639 --> 00:11:27,079
us and so some of the ways that we do

293
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:28,959
that we provide seeds to Community

294
00:11:27,078 --> 00:11:31,199
Gardens throughout the between cities we

295
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:33,359
are narrowing our Focus to a smaller

296
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:36,600
subset within the greater African leafy

297
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:39,278
vegetables and in some cases there is

298
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:41,480
just a real lack of available sessions

299
00:11:39,278 --> 00:11:43,799
and so we have a small Project work on

300
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:46,240
creating genetic diversity um through

301
00:11:43,799 --> 00:11:49,240
mut Genesis we send a small subsidy to

302
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:52,639
the nuclear reactor at UC Davis uh for

303
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:54,560
mutagenesis diversity generation and so

304
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:56,560
how is our group actually accomplish

305
00:11:54,559 --> 00:11:58,838
these uh building relationships

306
00:11:56,559 --> 00:12:01,679
relationships within the community we

307
00:11:58,839 --> 00:12:03,639
host a very large open house every year

308
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:06,278
we have a booth at the organic specialty

309
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:08,680
field day um and just a lot of

310
00:12:06,278 --> 00:12:12,278
reflective looking back is our language

311
00:12:08,679 --> 00:12:15,319
is our goals align properly um we get

312
00:12:12,278 --> 00:12:17,838
feedback from Dei we participate in

313
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:19,480
conferences uh two years ago we wrote a

314
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:21,880
guide to actually growing these emerging

315
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:24,320
vegetables and it won award at the

316
00:12:21,879 --> 00:12:27,439
American Society of horiculture meetings

317
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:29,560
and we also are out with the community

318
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:31,519
in these Farmers Market I believe we've

319
00:12:29,559 --> 00:12:33,119
attended six farmers markets last year

320
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:34,919
just getting our name out spreading that

321
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,519
word of mouth and so I want to highlight

322
00:12:34,919 --> 00:12:38,399
one in particular our field day so our

323
00:12:36,519 --> 00:12:41,000
field day was a great success we had

324
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:43,039
around 125 participants come to our plot

325
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,958
on campus and so one of the ways that we

326
00:12:43,039 --> 00:12:49,078
connect with people is over food um food

327
00:12:45,958 --> 00:12:51,679
is so essential so part of the of the

328
00:12:49,078 --> 00:12:54,838
cultural identity so the top left we had

329
00:12:51,679 --> 00:12:56,120
a potl style dinner before we actually

330
00:12:54,839 --> 00:12:57,760
went to the field people in the

331
00:12:56,120 --> 00:13:00,679
community were allowed to were

332
00:12:57,759 --> 00:13:02,838
encouraged to uh bringing food we had a

333
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:04,519
taste testing on the left here of all of

334
00:13:02,839 --> 00:13:07,320
our varieties more of its variety

335
00:13:04,519 --> 00:13:08,879
selection at the end of the day we had

336
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:10,360
um a giving Garden people were able to

337
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:11,519
take home large quantities of these

338
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:13,680
vegetables to try and cook for

339
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:16,919
themselves and here's just some pictures

340
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:18,359
of the actual field day and so very

341
00:13:16,919 --> 00:13:21,240
briefly talking about some our focused

342
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:23,440
species we're working on jup Mow so J M

343
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:25,519
same plant made for J fiber but in a

344
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:27,680
vegetable crop so these are different

345
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:30,600
germplasm pool as a leafy green

346
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:32,879
Ethiopian mustard so bras kinata also an

347
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:35,600
oil seed but we are really focusing on

348
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:38,399
the vegetable aspect of that uh clei

349
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:40,639
also known as Spider wisp um and

350
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:41,879
amaranth and just to highlight a little

351
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:43,839
bit about some of the idiotypes that we

352
00:13:41,879 --> 00:13:46,320
are working with some of these we want

353
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:47,440
them to flower earlier so for dup mow

354
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,920
really will not flower in time for

355
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,279
Minnesota they will produce seed Paws

356
00:13:48,919 --> 00:13:51,879
but they won't mature and so these are

357
00:13:50,278 --> 00:13:54,399
real tangible goals that we can increase

358
00:13:51,879 --> 00:13:56,360
the flowering time where conversely with

359
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:58,320
Ethiopian mustard we want to delay that

360
00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:00,039
flowering time It Bolts too soon it's a

361
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:02,519
leafy vegetable it makes great seed

362
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:04,000
production but as soon as it bolts soon

363
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:06,560
as it flowers the leaves turn more

364
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,839
bitter um so these are aspects that are

365
00:14:06,559 --> 00:14:10,879
tangible we feel within our Focus

366
00:14:08,839 --> 00:14:12,800
species um s to highlight some of the

367
00:14:10,879 --> 00:14:14,519
current challenges that we have um one

368
00:14:12,799 --> 00:14:16,919
of the main challenges we ran into is

369
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:19,919
just the common names so common names

370
00:14:16,919 --> 00:14:22,078
are useful but they're clunky uh and

371
00:14:19,919 --> 00:14:24,039
recognizing that some common names come

372
00:14:22,078 --> 00:14:26,958
from very challenging history so for

373
00:14:24,039 --> 00:14:29,679
example cpy is the name given by slave

374
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:32,958
owners by colonizers that demotes a crop

375
00:14:29,679 --> 00:14:34,439
for humans to nothing more than f for

376
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:36,479
livestock and within the greater

377
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:39,000
scientific Community cpy is still the

378
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:42,759
main word used and so we use that while

379
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:45,120
recognizing that different language is

380
00:14:42,759 --> 00:14:47,360
really needed um moving on to something

381
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:49,000
other challenges some our Focus species

382
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,480
have 20 plus common names when we are

383
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,278
writing our grower guide how do we

384
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:55,839
choose what name goes on the sky without

385
00:14:52,278 --> 00:14:57,958
leaving out certain um

386
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:59,680
communities and recognizing that a real

387
00:14:57,958 --> 00:15:01,479
subset of our audience does not trust

388
00:14:59,679 --> 00:15:03,439
University researchers and being aware

389
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:05,720
of that and respecting that respecting

390
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:07,000
boundaries uh one of our challenges

391
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:09,360
really is the lack of feedback from home

392
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,120
Cooks so we are able to get this

393
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,199
vegetables out to the community but we

394
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,198
have really had a challenge actually

395
00:15:12,198 --> 00:15:15,958
talking with the people cooking these

396
00:15:14,198 --> 00:15:18,359
the actual Final End user so that's one

397
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:20,479
of the things we hope to improve in the

398
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:22,199
future and lastly making suctions on FL

399
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:24,079
flavor this is a picture of me trying

400
00:15:22,198 --> 00:15:26,719
bitter ball so bitter balls this very

401
00:15:24,078 --> 00:15:29,399
bitter eggplant um I really do not like

402
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:32,560
bitter flavors and that's authentic it's

403
00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:35,559
important to be realistic to embrace

404
00:15:32,559 --> 00:15:38,039
these um but within the greater goal of

405
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:39,599
reatory plant breeding uh we are not the

406
00:15:38,039 --> 00:15:41,879
ones making selections we are not

407
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:43,480
applying a western sense of flavor so a

408
00:15:41,879 --> 00:15:46,600
lot of some general themes to these

409
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:47,879
African vegetables is bitterness they

410
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:50,360
like it to be bitter they want it to be

411
00:15:47,879 --> 00:15:54,639
more bitter as well as texture the slimy

412
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:56,879
myogenous aspect uh wherein uh American

413
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:58,278
would cook oakr we would hide that we'

414
00:15:56,879 --> 00:16:00,480
breed that a lot of our communities

415
00:15:58,278 --> 00:16:03,159
would make a soup of okra to enhance

416
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:04,959
that slimy

417
00:16:03,159 --> 00:16:07,278
texture uh some of the things that we've

418
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:10,359
learned so language matters even just

419
00:16:07,278 --> 00:16:12,078
within what we call our group so our

420
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:15,199
working name for a while was the

421
00:16:12,078 --> 00:16:17,318
vegetable breeding for immigrant farmers

422
00:16:15,198 --> 00:16:19,439
and we really change that we recognize

423
00:16:17,318 --> 00:16:22,159
there is a power Dynamic when you say we

424
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:23,920
are working for so we really strongly

425
00:16:22,159 --> 00:16:25,519
change that we're working with

426
00:16:23,919 --> 00:16:28,000
communities

427
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:30,360
uh and now our new name is the community

428
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,720
plant breing team and I should say this

429
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:34,199
is uh an Outreach arm of the plant

430
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:36,639
breeding center under the guidance of

431
00:16:34,198 --> 00:16:39,000
Rex Bernardo um even just some our

432
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:41,278
language around the word immigrants so

433
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,679
we are working with people that are

434
00:16:41,278 --> 00:16:44,679
second generation third generation from

435
00:16:42,679 --> 00:16:46,519
immigrants we are working with people

436
00:16:44,679 --> 00:16:48,318
that might be on Refugee status and so

437
00:16:46,519 --> 00:16:51,240
some of our language would be moving

438
00:16:48,318 --> 00:16:53,399
more towards the African diaspora

439
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:55,720
instead of using the word immigrants uh

440
00:16:53,399 --> 00:16:59,159
respect boundaries very important and

441
00:16:55,720 --> 00:17:00,639
challenging at the same time to learn um

442
00:16:59,159 --> 00:17:03,799
about that and to maybe try and heal

443
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:05,679
some of these uh perceptions about the

444
00:17:03,799 --> 00:17:07,240
University of Minnesota uh another thing

445
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:09,160
that we learned don't think don't take

446
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:10,720
things at face value so some of the

447
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:13,880
scientific Publications out there that

448
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:16,959
you would read um would say this species

449
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:19,679
is for uh or this idiotype this German

450
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:22,078
plasm pool is for vegetable consumption

451
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:23,400
this is for biofuel for Fiber Well when

452
00:17:22,078 --> 00:17:24,798
actually talking with the community it

453
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:26,559
turns out some of the published articles

454
00:17:24,798 --> 00:17:29,279
are wrong or flip-flopped so really

455
00:17:26,558 --> 00:17:31,319
highlighting the importance of that oral

456
00:17:29,279 --> 00:17:34,279
knowledge um listening to the Community

457
00:17:31,319 --> 00:17:36,359
Learning from and learning with so with

458
00:17:34,279 --> 00:17:38,798
that Mutual learning we are learning so

459
00:17:36,359 --> 00:17:40,399
much more so much about these vegetables

460
00:17:38,798 --> 00:17:41,918
we are not pretending to be experts we

461
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,519
are able to share some of our knowledge

462
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:45,160
in plant science while still learning at

463
00:17:43,519 --> 00:17:47,038
the same time and I really want to

464
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:49,840
highlight how rewarding that has been so

465
00:17:47,038 --> 00:17:51,919
I work in the soy breing lab uh This

466
00:17:49,839 --> 00:17:54,240
research this volunteer work has really

467
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:56,240
changed my perspective and just how we

468
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,798
interact with stakeholders and the

469
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,960
diverse stakeholders and meeting

470
00:17:57,798 --> 00:18:01,158
different needs and sometimes

471
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:04,038
stakeholders have contrasting OT types

472
00:18:01,159 --> 00:18:07,280
and how we can bring this knowledge to

473
00:18:04,038 --> 00:18:08,599
our research to my research and then so

474
00:18:07,279 --> 00:18:10,079
what's next so we are really

475
00:18:08,599 --> 00:18:12,119
highlighting this year reaching out to

476
00:18:10,079 --> 00:18:14,279
homecooks sort of quantifying that

477
00:18:12,119 --> 00:18:17,879
flavor and texture of these vegetables

478
00:18:14,279 --> 00:18:20,200
uh within our available uh diverse

479
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:22,640
accessions we hope to release a variety

480
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:24,120
near future so we have one for J M so

481
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:26,120
over four years we have been selecting

482
00:18:24,119 --> 00:18:27,639
for early and earlier flowering and we

483
00:18:26,119 --> 00:18:29,879
have seen a gradual increase in

484
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:33,038
flowering time and so so we believe that

485
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:35,520
is ready to release the seeds uh but one

486
00:18:33,038 --> 00:18:36,720
of the main aspects here is okay we are

487
00:18:35,519 --> 00:18:38,879
not going to monetize this we're going

488
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:40,319
to freely release this um there might be

489
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:42,200
a small cost for the production of the

490
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:43,798
seed uh and that's where we're

491
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:45,960
partnering with North Circle seed for

492
00:18:43,798 --> 00:18:48,798
that um but we really viewing ourselves

493
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:53,159
not to monetize off of this work um our

494
00:18:48,798 --> 00:18:55,240
Outreach so we are developing more uh

495
00:18:53,159 --> 00:18:56,559
ways to quantify this information some

496
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:59,279
of these communities have expressed to

497
00:18:56,558 --> 00:19:01,558
us a real Challenge and conveying their

498
00:18:59,279 --> 00:19:03,519
knowledge to the Next Generation to

499
00:19:01,558 --> 00:19:06,119
their children and so we are helping

500
00:19:03,519 --> 00:19:08,679
write down this knowledge make handouts

501
00:19:06,119 --> 00:19:10,639
that are able to be given to the uh

502
00:19:08,679 --> 00:19:12,640
interested people as well as education

503
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:15,520
so we work really closely with the

504
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:17,038
master garders community and they are

505
00:19:15,519 --> 00:19:19,400
required to have continuing education

506
00:19:17,038 --> 00:19:22,599
credits every year and so we act as a

507
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:23,840
qualified um provider of those credits

508
00:19:22,599 --> 00:19:26,000
as well as increasing our community

509
00:19:23,839 --> 00:19:28,319
engagement just two weeks ago I was at

510
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,400
our local Natural History Museum talking

511
00:19:28,319 --> 00:19:34,038
about a work talking about the community

512
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:35,759
and talking with just other non-target

513
00:19:34,038 --> 00:19:37,200
community members that are really

514
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:38,919
interested in work we're doing so we

515
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,279
invited them to our field day to come

516
00:19:38,919 --> 00:19:41,480
and taste these vegetables to see them

517
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:44,759
with your own eyes to feel them with

518
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:46,440
your own hands um and lastly uh we're

519
00:19:44,759 --> 00:19:48,359
really sort of Outsourcing working with

520
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:50,759
a third party of North Circle seeds

521
00:19:48,359 --> 00:19:52,479
actually be the seed supplier and So

522
00:19:50,759 --> 00:19:54,919
within this I'm going to acknowledge our

523
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:57,079
group uh all this work is done at the St

524
00:19:54,919 --> 00:19:59,159
Paul research farm with a lot of helps

525
00:19:57,079 --> 00:20:01,119
thanks to Andy and Jason

526
00:19:59,159 --> 00:20:02,960
uh this is on student organic farm a lot

527
00:20:01,119 --> 00:20:04,759
of our students here have no experience

528
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:06,840
working on organic farm and so we really

529
00:20:04,759 --> 00:20:09,640
relied upon their knowledge of organic

530
00:20:06,839 --> 00:20:11,038
practices so big thanks to Tory doll as

531
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:13,240
well as within the hen County Master

532
00:20:11,038 --> 00:20:15,319
Gardeners they provide probably half the

533
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:18,759
labor force required for this field it

534
00:20:15,319 --> 00:20:20,839
is a large amount of work um on the

535
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:22,759
right here you see we lay drip tape

536
00:20:20,839 --> 00:20:24,519
landscape fabric most of the things that

537
00:20:22,759 --> 00:20:26,759
we do are transplanted and it is

538
00:20:24,519 --> 00:20:28,158
important to acknowledge that this took

539
00:20:26,759 --> 00:20:29,440
place on the University of Minnesota

540
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:31,720
land which is in the traditional

541
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:33,320
homelands of Dakota people and lastly

542
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:36,360
for funding we received some more

543
00:20:33,319 --> 00:20:39,200
funding from our College of a which is C

544
00:20:36,359 --> 00:20:42,279
fans and the plant breeding center and

545
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,930
so with that I thank you and open time

546
00:20:42,279 --> 00:20:46,699
for

547
00:20:42,930 --> 00:20:46,699
[Applause]

548
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:53,200
questions yeah that's a great question

549
00:20:51,279 --> 00:20:55,200
so most of this has been active learning

550
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:57,200
we sit down as a group we learn together

551
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:59,440
and in some ways we make mistakes so a

552
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:01,440
lot of our early work

553
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:04,640
particularly related to language we've

554
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:06,279
learned okay this is not an ideal way um

555
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,799
no I wish we actually had better

556
00:21:06,279 --> 00:21:09,960
teaching classes for participatory plant

557
00:21:07,798 --> 00:21:13,000
breing um I do see that as maybe a

558
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:13,000
weakness within University of

559
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:22,200
Minnesota yeah that is an excellent

560
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:24,600
concept and really a major challenge of

561
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:26,640
us so we are student volunteers our

562
00:21:24,599 --> 00:21:28,599
average volunteer length would be two

563
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:30,120
two and a half years um I'm part of the

564
00:21:28,599 --> 00:21:31,839
second cohort I'm transitioning off at

565
00:21:30,119 --> 00:21:34,558
the end of this month actually and so

566
00:21:31,839 --> 00:21:37,480
one of the ways we do that is we have an

567
00:21:34,558 --> 00:21:39,798
onboarding and offboarding documentation

568
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:41,640
um but even then there are still

569
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:45,158
limitations to that so within our group

570
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:47,120
we have assigned positions and before um

571
00:21:45,159 --> 00:21:49,440
one person off boards you need to find a

572
00:21:47,119 --> 00:21:53,119
replacement and so we're working with

573
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:55,000
that but we see that maybe a long-term

574
00:21:53,119 --> 00:21:57,839
technician would be incredibly

575
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:01,278
beneficial to for provide some

576
00:21:57,839 --> 00:22:01,278
continuity across

577
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:09,640
time yeah and so Rex is there but Rex is

578
00:22:07,038 --> 00:22:11,319
a very hands-off adviser and so if

579
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:13,480
anyone is interested in collaborating

580
00:22:11,319 --> 00:22:16,319
writing grants to fund technicians we'd

581
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:16,319
be really interested in

582
00:22:20,119 --> 00:22:24,000
that yeah that's a great question I was

583
00:22:22,599 --> 00:22:26,158
not there during the start of this so

584
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,599
I'm not sure how much I can provide um I

585
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:29,720
know that Rex was really the driving

586
00:22:27,599 --> 00:22:33,240
force behind this he saw the need

587
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:35,159
through the article um and through that

588
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:37,278
really devoted a large amount of funding

589
00:22:35,159 --> 00:22:40,278
from the plant prining Center to work

590
00:22:37,278 --> 00:22:42,359
with this to more ask your question

591
00:22:40,278 --> 00:22:45,159
about how do we connect with the

592
00:22:42,359 --> 00:22:47,599
community in a respectful way it's just

593
00:22:45,159 --> 00:22:50,760
really slow Word of Mouth being

594
00:22:47,599 --> 00:22:53,558
authentic to yourself going out there um

595
00:22:50,759 --> 00:22:55,200
and really teaching people okay it's

596
00:22:53,558 --> 00:22:57,200
really important to respect

597
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:59,880
boundaries it is challenging sometimes

598
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:02,600
to hear that a subset of people do not

599
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:07,278
value work protest your work and being

600
00:23:02,599 --> 00:23:07,278
respectful is part of that learning

601
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:19,240
process it's really provided a great

602
00:23:17,278 --> 00:23:22,599
amount of experiences to us at

603
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:22,599
University of Minnesota

604
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:40,120
[Music]

605
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:43,759
I don't know that's and then the other

606
00:23:40,119 --> 00:23:43,759
thing I just wanted to say

607
00:24:00,839 --> 00:24:07,599
yeah and it's important to recognize

608
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:07,600
that because Cornell took the most land

609
00:24:11,798 --> 00:24:16,798
yeah yeah that's a great question it is

610
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:20,558
a big challenge um within that open sea

611
00:24:16,798 --> 00:24:23,038
Source initiative there is a very weak

612
00:24:20,558 --> 00:24:24,960
verbal agreement just that okay if you

613
00:24:23,038 --> 00:24:26,319
receive seed you will not develop a

614
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:28,640
product you will not commercialize this

615
00:24:26,319 --> 00:24:30,639
STM plasm um but it has been challenge

616
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:31,919
working with some of these uh even just

617
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:34,120
like the world vegetable Center there is

618
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:36,360
an MTA associated with that there is an

619
00:24:34,119 --> 00:24:38,079
exception for community members but if

620
00:24:36,359 --> 00:24:39,439
you're not a Community member it is our

621
00:24:38,079 --> 00:24:41,798
responsibility if we give you C to pass

622
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:44,480
on the MTA and so just that fact of

623
00:24:41,798 --> 00:24:46,879
passing on MTA can sometimes be very

624
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:48,519
prohibited um it's a challenge that we

625
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,960
are working with um just yesterday I was

626
00:24:48,519 --> 00:24:52,519
talking with maybe acquiring some

627
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:54,399
cassava cuttings and well there's MTA

628
00:24:52,519 --> 00:24:58,000
process there requires going through our

629
00:24:54,398 --> 00:25:00,798
lawyers that's a six-month process and

630
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,798
being aware of

631
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:14,679
that that's a great question and if you

632
00:25:12,798 --> 00:25:17,679
have any advice I'm definitely

633
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:20,240
open because it is a challenge and so

634
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:23,120
Rex really advises our students okay

635
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:25,079
make sure your research comes first um

636
00:25:23,119 --> 00:25:27,519
but with this this work that we're doing

637
00:25:25,079 --> 00:25:30,678
it's so fun it's so easy to just oh I

638
00:25:27,519 --> 00:25:33,359
worked five hours on this um it's a work

639
00:25:30,679 --> 00:25:35,240
in progress it's important to juggle

640
00:25:33,359 --> 00:25:37,519
that to respect that and I guess maybe

641
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:41,200
just ultimately relying upon our team we

642
00:25:37,519 --> 00:25:43,200
have a team of 12 to 15 people and it's

643
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:45,919
important to delegate those activities

644
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:47,720
to trust them in doing the work um and

645
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:51,720
just work

646
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:51,720
collaboratively yeah

647
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:09,600
yeah that's a great question so within

648
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:11,319
our field day two years ago we had the

649
00:26:09,599 --> 00:26:13,519
idea of doing surveys we printed out

650
00:26:11,319 --> 00:26:15,678
surveys we handed them out one of 80

651
00:26:13,519 --> 00:26:16,759
people filled out a survey and so one of

652
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:19,278
the best ways to connect with our

653
00:26:16,759 --> 00:26:21,278
community really is verbally and so

654
00:26:19,278 --> 00:26:24,079
within our large team we delegate people

655
00:26:21,278 --> 00:26:26,519
okay go out and talk to

656
00:26:24,079 --> 00:26:28,759
attendees and remember what they said

657
00:26:26,519 --> 00:26:30,359
and write down afterwards um might be

658
00:26:28,759 --> 00:26:33,359
more efficient ways to do that but that

659
00:26:30,359 --> 00:26:33,359
is where we're at

660
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:42,319
now that's a great question um it is a

661
00:26:39,119 --> 00:26:44,359
big challenge of us we recognize that we

662
00:26:42,319 --> 00:26:47,200
try and say okay hybrids are more

663
00:26:44,359 --> 00:26:48,879
productive there is a benefit of that um

664
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:50,840
but also maybe changeing our Viewpoint

665
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:53,200
to see where they come from they really

666
00:26:50,839 --> 00:26:54,839
want to save these seeds year after year

667
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:57,240
in a hybrid setting that would not be

668
00:26:54,839 --> 00:26:59,000
possible within hybrid seed there's a

669
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:00,558
greater upfront cost to some of these

670
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:03,519
which might be prohibited to certain

671
00:27:00,558 --> 00:27:06,278
community members and so we in this

672
00:27:03,519 --> 00:27:07,839
Mutual learning we are conveying that um

673
00:27:06,278 --> 00:27:10,359
also learning from them their

674
00:27:07,839 --> 00:27:12,599
preferences and respecting

675
00:27:10,359 --> 00:27:14,879
them and we're gonna be taking a

676
00:27:12,599 --> 00:27:17,319
15minute coffee break uh please be back

677
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:20,159
here at 10:50 for our next speaker thank

678
00:27:17,319 --> 00:27:22,200
you all so much welcome back everyone

679
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:24,919
hope you enjoyed uh some refreshments

680
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:26,919
and some coffee uh I'm really honored to

681
00:27:24,919 --> 00:27:28,720
introduce one of our own svic Hansen

682
00:27:26,919 --> 00:27:31,200
here svic is part of

683
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:33,640
Dr Jenny Moore's lab where she leads the

684
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:35,720
national cover crop breeding Network

685
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:38,038
solv got her PhD from the University of

686
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:40,038
Wisconsin and completed a post stock at

687
00:27:38,038 --> 00:27:43,398
the University of British Columbia she

688
00:27:40,038 --> 00:27:46,359
also uh in in her past co-owned and

689
00:27:43,398 --> 00:27:48,839
operated a vegetable farm up in Iowa and

690
00:27:46,359 --> 00:27:51,719
so svig is well versed in genetics

691
00:27:48,839 --> 00:27:54,480
genomics uh production Agriculture and

692
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:56,600
distory research and she is here to pres

693
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:59,038
present us her talk toward 40 million

694
00:27:56,599 --> 00:28:01,158
cover Acres reading fall Stone cover

695
00:27:59,038 --> 00:28:04,720
crops for ecosystem services and Pharm

696
00:28:01,159 --> 00:28:04,720
system compatibility let's welcome

697
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:10,319
solig thank you for having me here today

698
00:28:07,759 --> 00:28:12,119
I'm excited to represent the uh cover

699
00:28:10,319 --> 00:28:13,839
crop breeding network and to add our

700
00:28:12,119 --> 00:28:17,000
stories to this conversation about

701
00:28:13,839 --> 00:28:19,158
breeding for novel and complex systems

702
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:21,038
I've titled this talk to evoke a big

703
00:28:19,159 --> 00:28:23,120
Vision which is the same way that the

704
00:28:21,038 --> 00:28:25,000
cover crop reading Network began its

705
00:28:23,119 --> 00:28:27,479
work back in

706
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:30,359
2015 so I'm going to start by unpacking

707
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:33,640
that vision why cover crops why 40

708
00:28:30,359 --> 00:28:36,319
million Acres uh and why Tor as in why

709
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:40,000
aren't we there yet then I'll talk about

710
00:28:36,319 --> 00:28:42,678
the uh role of of breeding in cover crop

711
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,599
adoption what makes cover crop systems

712
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:46,960
novel and unique and therefore apt to

713
00:28:44,599 --> 00:28:49,199
talk about today I'll discuss our

714
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:52,399
breeding Pipeline and then some crop

715
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:55,240
specific breeding goals So Soft seed in

716
00:28:52,398 --> 00:28:58,759
vetch uh cold tolerance in Winter pee

717
00:28:55,240 --> 00:29:00,359
and a lpath in Rye and then I'll talk

718
00:28:58,759 --> 00:29:03,839
about some Frontiers that we hope will

719
00:29:00,359 --> 00:29:07,759
include many million more cover cropped

720
00:29:03,839 --> 00:29:09,879
Acres so first why cover crops cover

721
00:29:07,759 --> 00:29:11,919
crops offer many benefits that become

722
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:14,960
obvious when you look at pictures like

723
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:17,278
this so on the left there's a soybean

724
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:20,399
field that has had some early season

725
00:29:17,278 --> 00:29:22,640
erosion and then a cover cropped soybean

726
00:29:20,398 --> 00:29:25,398
field that has held its soil on the

727
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:27,240
right you see some soil from a concord

728
00:29:25,398 --> 00:29:28,879
grape Orchard in Western New York and

729
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:31,159
you can see the differ

730
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:34,880
uh in soil structure after 10 years of

731
00:29:31,159 --> 00:29:37,960
cover cropping among about 550 farmers

732
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:40,519
who responded to the latest 2022 23

733
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:42,558
National cover crops survey uh they

734
00:29:40,519 --> 00:29:44,480
people cited many reasons for using

735
00:29:42,558 --> 00:29:48,119
cover crops but most of them evolved

736
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:50,440
around soil health so um building soil

737
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:52,599
structure increasing water infiltration

738
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:54,759
reducing nitrogen leeching other

739
00:29:52,599 --> 00:29:56,319
benefits include creating pollinator

740
00:29:54,759 --> 00:29:59,679
habitat

741
00:29:56,319 --> 00:30:02,519
um and weed supr ression things like

742
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:04,960
that copper crops can be sewn in the

743
00:30:02,519 --> 00:30:08,480
spring or summer to cover soil until

744
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:12,278
fall or sewn in the fall to cover soil

745
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:15,240
over winter um or to Winter kill fall

746
00:30:12,278 --> 00:30:16,839
sewing takes place after cash crop

747
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:19,519
Harvest

748
00:30:16,839 --> 00:30:21,439
um so between mid-september and late

749
00:30:19,519 --> 00:30:24,120
October in this area that planting

750
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:25,720
window is often quite narrow and in

751
00:30:24,119 --> 00:30:29,079
competition with a lot of important

752
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:30,679
Harvest tasks cover establishment is

753
00:30:29,079 --> 00:30:32,359
generally best when it's drilled or

754
00:30:30,679 --> 00:30:34,679
planted directly into the soil but

755
00:30:32,359 --> 00:30:36,918
sometimes it's also flown on or

756
00:30:34,679 --> 00:30:40,240
interceded into standing crops to

757
00:30:36,919 --> 00:30:42,519
mitigate that late season uh time

758
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:44,519
crunch fallstone cover crops are

759
00:30:42,519 --> 00:30:48,278
terminated in several ways they can be

760
00:30:44,519 --> 00:30:50,359
tilled they can be rolled with that roll

761
00:30:48,278 --> 00:30:53,200
a roller like this big Burly one or they

762
00:30:50,359 --> 00:30:53,199
can be sprayed

763
00:30:53,398 --> 00:30:59,518
down so cover crops provide important

764
00:30:56,558 --> 00:31:01,038
ecosystem services so why do I specify

765
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:04,000
40 million

766
00:31:01,038 --> 00:31:06,119
Acres the 2017 USDA census of

767
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,798
Agriculture cites a little over 15

768
00:31:06,119 --> 00:31:10,398
million cover crop acres in production

769
00:31:08,798 --> 00:31:13,158
we are still awaiting the comparable

770
00:31:10,398 --> 00:31:16,199
figure from 2022 but we see from these

771
00:31:13,159 --> 00:31:17,960
annual National cover crop surveys uh a

772
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:21,720
steady increase in the number of cover

773
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:24,120
crop acres per respondent cover crop

774
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:26,720
incentive programs are active and

775
00:31:24,119 --> 00:31:29,398
growing at federal state and private or

776
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:31,759
corporate levels and a recent work from

777
00:31:29,398 --> 00:31:34,359
Matt Ryan's group here at Cornell showed

778
00:31:31,759 --> 00:31:36,759
that even after ceasing participation in

779
00:31:34,359 --> 00:31:39,119
these incentive programs cover cropped

780
00:31:36,759 --> 00:31:41,158
Acres remained about a third higher on

781
00:31:39,119 --> 00:31:44,038
farms that had participated so once

782
00:31:41,159 --> 00:31:46,720
people see what cover cropping can do to

783
00:31:44,038 --> 00:31:49,879
their soil uh they want to at least some

784
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:49,880
of them want to keep doing

785
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:57,120
it so why 40 million 40 million has been

786
00:31:54,558 --> 00:31:58,398
designated as a an ambitious but

787
00:31:57,119 --> 00:32:00,239
reachable goal

788
00:31:58,398 --> 00:32:02,759
by the national cover crop variety

789
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:06,200
development project a cap grant that we

790
00:32:02,759 --> 00:32:06,200
are uh a part

791
00:32:07,798 --> 00:32:13,879
of and finally why toward why aren't we

792
00:32:11,278 --> 00:32:15,960
there yet so cover cropping takes time

793
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:18,720
to learn and it may not be right for

794
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:21,319
every situation the issues here were top

795
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:22,880
of mind for about 150 Growers who

796
00:32:21,319 --> 00:32:24,798
responded to the National cover cropping

797
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:26,960
survey saying they weren't using cover

798
00:32:24,798 --> 00:32:28,519
crops at this time and these could be

799
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:30,720
legitimate concerns especially for

800
00:32:28,519 --> 00:32:33,200
Growers who are earlier in their cover

801
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:36,720
cropping experience so some Farms do

802
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:39,159
experience um economic benefits say um

803
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:42,480
from lower fertilizer or herbicide costs

804
00:32:39,159 --> 00:32:45,639
but not every farm and not every year

805
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:48,079
but the items that I've starred here uh

806
00:32:45,638 --> 00:32:50,359
achieving a good stand mitigating cover

807
00:32:48,079 --> 00:32:52,599
crop weediness and uh helping with the

808
00:32:50,359 --> 00:32:54,678
financial cost benefit analysis of using

809
00:32:52,599 --> 00:32:55,959
cover crops are things we can work on

810
00:32:54,679 --> 00:32:58,919
through

811
00:32:55,960 --> 00:33:01,200
breeding to identify breeding goals the

812
00:32:58,919 --> 00:33:03,759
cover crop breeding Network back in

813
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:06,120
201617 uh carried out a survey of over

814
00:33:03,759 --> 00:33:07,638
400 farmers and asked them what traits

815
00:33:06,119 --> 00:33:11,119
they thought were most important for the

816
00:33:07,638 --> 00:33:13,398
crops we plan to work on the most

817
00:33:11,119 --> 00:33:15,158
frequently cited was nitrogen fixation

818
00:33:13,398 --> 00:33:18,199
which we have investigated and found

819
00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:20,240
correlates very highly with biomass

820
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:23,278
biomass is an important goal anyway

821
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:25,638
because in combination with early Vigor

822
00:33:23,278 --> 00:33:27,359
um it helps with weed competition and

823
00:33:25,638 --> 00:33:29,278
all of those soil health benefits that

824
00:33:27,359 --> 00:33:32,079
come with decomposition from that cover

825
00:33:29,278 --> 00:33:34,200
crop residue into the soil winter

826
00:33:32,079 --> 00:33:36,960
hardiness is a big goal because perhaps

827
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:39,360
obviously it is necessary for uh spring

828
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:41,038
stands in places with cold Winters and

829
00:33:39,359 --> 00:33:43,240
finally we didn't ask on this survey

830
00:33:41,038 --> 00:33:45,398
about seed yield um because it's not a

831
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:47,558
farmer facing trait necessarily but we

832
00:33:45,398 --> 00:33:51,719
know that that's important to make uh

833
00:33:47,558 --> 00:33:54,359
cover crop seed affordable for

834
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:58,679
Farmers so what makes breeding cover

835
00:33:54,359 --> 00:34:01,000
crops novel and complex first

836
00:33:58,679 --> 00:34:03,720
uh crop domestication

837
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:06,159
usually involves elimination of seed

838
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:09,320
dorcy or hard seed seed that fails to

839
00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:11,760
embibe water uh right after planting to

840
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:14,960
emerge in the first season crimson

841
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:16,679
clover and hary vet two of our uh crops

842
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:19,639
still have substantial proportions of

843
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:22,358
hard seed haret is also prone to pod

844
00:34:19,639 --> 00:34:24,000
dehance or pod shatter which makes seed

845
00:34:22,358 --> 00:34:26,878
production less profitable and

846
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:29,559
exacerbates that weediness issue that's

847
00:34:26,878 --> 00:34:31,598
caused by the heart seed seed even for

848
00:34:29,559 --> 00:34:33,759
crops like winter pea and serial Rye

849
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:35,800
that have undergone domestication most

850
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:38,200
breeding thus far has been done for

851
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:42,519
either food quality or for forage

852
00:34:38,199 --> 00:34:42,519
quality not for cover crop use per

853
00:34:42,599 --> 00:34:48,280
se in addition the cover crop seed

854
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:50,280
system is relatively less developed uh

855
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:52,639
and less Consolidated than major cash

856
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:54,960
crop seed systems so this is a figure

857
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:58,280
from a CCB Network paper that talks

858
00:34:54,960 --> 00:35:01,599
about three tiers of uh

859
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:03,280
of cover crop seed companies so tier one

860
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:06,039
are companies that sell only to other

861
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:08,480
businesses symbolized by a semi TR tier

862
00:35:06,039 --> 00:35:10,239
three sell directly to Farmers

863
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:13,079
symbolized by a pickup truck and the

864
00:35:10,239 --> 00:35:16,559
tier 2 companies do some of

865
00:35:13,079 --> 00:35:18,880
each as of 2021 over 40 companies were

866
00:35:16,559 --> 00:35:21,799
in tier one or two so doing some some

867
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:25,119
are all wholesale sales of cover crop

868
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:28,039
seed to a variety of different regions

869
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:29,920
um and and farm markets

870
00:35:28,039 --> 00:35:34,559
so there are a lot of possible points of

871
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:36,200
entry for covera breeders to get

872
00:35:34,559 --> 00:35:38,400
varieties into the marketplace but it's

873
00:35:36,199 --> 00:35:40,039
really important to know what region

874
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:42,480
different seed companies Target and what

875
00:35:40,039 --> 00:35:44,880
cropping systems they target and last

876
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:47,559
I'll mention that consumer farmer bubble

877
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:50,000
down there is a really Vibrant Community

878
00:35:47,559 --> 00:35:51,880
of practitioners and researchers I

879
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,960
really enjoy coming from the organic

880
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:55,720
farming side that it's a combination of

881
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:57,720
organic and conventional farmers and a

882
00:35:55,719 --> 00:35:59,279
really productive and creative Exchange

883
00:35:57,719 --> 00:36:02,399
of

884
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:05,200
ideas finally most cover crop seed that

885
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:09,000
is used right now is variety not stated

886
00:36:05,199 --> 00:36:11,199
or even farmer grown and unlabeled seed

887
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:13,358
the advantage to VNS seed is that it's

888
00:36:11,199 --> 00:36:15,559
widely available and

889
00:36:13,358 --> 00:36:17,119
inexpensive the disadvantage is that you

890
00:36:15,559 --> 00:36:18,719
don't know exactly what you're getting

891
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:20,440
and if you really like how it works you

892
00:36:18,719 --> 00:36:23,879
can't necessarily go back and get more

893
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:25,519
of the same for a following year so VNS

894
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:27,200
seed is better than nothing it's

895
00:36:25,519 --> 00:36:29,519
important to get soil covered that's the

896
00:36:27,199 --> 00:36:32,358
first priority but as breeders our

897
00:36:29,519 --> 00:36:34,759
challenge is can we improve cover crops

898
00:36:32,358 --> 00:36:37,880
enough that it's worth breeders or worth

899
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:40,079
Growers money to um buy a name variety

900
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:41,079
to increase their chances of success

901
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:44,240
with cover

902
00:36:41,079 --> 00:36:46,680
cropping we're also interested in

903
00:36:44,239 --> 00:36:50,078
supporting a skilled informal seed

904
00:36:46,679 --> 00:36:52,118
system or seed growing um selection and

905
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:55,079
trade among

906
00:36:52,119 --> 00:36:56,760
Farmers we've in addition to a formal

907
00:36:55,079 --> 00:36:58,079
seed system that's directed through seed

908
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:59,960
companies

909
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:03,119
we feel we need to realize that because

910
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:05,280
cover crops um offer a long-term

911
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:08,000
ecological benefit but not necessarily A

912
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:09,119
short-term economic benefit uh farmers

913
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,800
will have different budgetary

914
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:13,599
constraints depending on their cropping

915
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:15,960
system and and overall situation so we

916
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:18,720
need to provide multiple avenues for

917
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:21,240
getting highquality cover crop seed uh

918
00:37:18,719 --> 00:37:24,879
into the marketplace and onto

919
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:26,598
Fields so the novelty the opportunity

920
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:28,480
and the challenge of breeding for cover

921
00:37:26,599 --> 00:37:29,838
crop systems are that that we're working

922
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:31,760
with species that have undergone less

923
00:37:29,838 --> 00:37:33,639
breeding work we're working with a

924
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:37,880
younger seed industry and we want to

925
00:37:33,639 --> 00:37:40,598
support both formal and informal uh seed

926
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:43,079
systems and that fact that cover crops

927
00:37:40,599 --> 00:37:45,160
offer short uh lower short-term economic

928
00:37:43,079 --> 00:37:48,160
value leading to uh competition or

929
00:37:45,159 --> 00:37:49,639
coexistence with BNS and farmer Farmer

930
00:37:48,159 --> 00:37:53,039
grown

931
00:37:49,639 --> 00:37:54,559
seed so in response to this challenge

932
00:37:53,039 --> 00:37:57,279
the cover crop braiding network was

933
00:37:54,559 --> 00:37:59,838
founded back in 2015 as a collaboration

934
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:02,839
of among universities AR research

935
00:37:59,838 --> 00:38:04,920
programs and uh nrcs plant material

936
00:38:02,838 --> 00:38:07,078
centers it has grown to include many

937
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:09,440
sites this year we have nine breeding

938
00:38:07,079 --> 00:38:11,240
sites four farmer breeders and 15 trial

939
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:15,159
sites across the

940
00:38:11,239 --> 00:38:17,039
country in this first Nationwide public

941
00:38:15,159 --> 00:38:18,679
cover crop breeding effort the group

942
00:38:17,039 --> 00:38:22,279
started by working on three of the most

943
00:38:18,679 --> 00:38:24,199
commonly sewn uh winter annual legumes

944
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:26,359
uh winter pea hary Veet and crimson

945
00:38:24,199 --> 00:38:28,598
clover about two years we started

946
00:38:26,358 --> 00:38:30,279
working in Earnest on

947
00:38:28,599 --> 00:38:32,800
and then we added brasas this year

948
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:34,920
focusing on winter canola so each of

949
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:37,039
these crops has a leader who is

950
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:39,599
responsible for breeding pipeline design

951
00:38:37,039 --> 00:38:42,639
and centralized analysis of data from

952
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:43,838
these various trials and nurseries um

953
00:38:42,639 --> 00:38:46,559
and

954
00:38:43,838 --> 00:38:48,759
notably Cornell serves as the hub for

955
00:38:46,559 --> 00:38:50,480
the cover crop reading Network my boss

956
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:51,920
Jenny Moore is the national program

957
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:54,280
director for the cover crop reading

958
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:58,280
Network and as coordinator I get to work

959
00:38:54,280 --> 00:39:01,119
with over 50 um

960
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:03,280
technicians researchers students farmer

961
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:04,760
collaborators across the country to make

962
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:07,800
this thing

963
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:09,480
run and to note I get to be the one

964
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:11,960
talking up here today but the stories

965
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:14,159
I'm telling wouldn't be the same stories

966
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:16,679
without contributions from all these

967
00:39:14,159 --> 00:39:18,920
people so as I've mentioned in all our

968
00:39:16,679 --> 00:39:20,879
crops we're breeding for biomass Vigor

969
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:22,720
and winter survival we also have some

970
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:25,440
crop specific goals I'll talk

971
00:39:22,719 --> 00:39:27,078
specifically about soft seed and vetch

972
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:27,880
uh cold tolerance and freeze thaw

973
00:39:27,079 --> 00:39:31,359
tolerance

974
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:34,599
in Winter PE and both Al apathy and uh

975
00:39:31,358 --> 00:39:36,078
cold tolerance in Ry this is our you

976
00:39:34,599 --> 00:39:38,280
you'll notice the question mark under

977
00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:41,280
the brasas this is our very first year

978
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:43,680
looking at brasas uh so in collaboration

979
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:45,640
with Mike Stan M Kansas State University

980
00:39:43,679 --> 00:39:47,039
who's just supplied some germplasm from

981
00:39:45,639 --> 00:39:49,279
his program that he feels could have

982
00:39:47,039 --> 00:39:50,838
promised for cover crop applications so

983
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:52,519
we're looking at it and once we see

984
00:39:50,838 --> 00:39:55,239
what's there we'll figure out uh where

985
00:39:52,519 --> 00:39:58,440
we need to go with the breeding

986
00:39:55,239 --> 00:40:00,479
program for the legumes and Ry our

987
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:02,599
pipeline uh starts with breeding

988
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:05,480
nurseries like these where we note and

989
00:40:02,599 --> 00:40:06,519
select single plants for the legumes

990
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:08,639
which we've been working on for the

991
00:40:06,519 --> 00:40:11,358
longest time the next step is Advanced

992
00:40:08,639 --> 00:40:13,519
line trials so these are 15 foot plots

993
00:40:11,358 --> 00:40:15,838
flanked by tril to simulate that

994
00:40:13,519 --> 00:40:17,880
competition with a small grain in a mix

995
00:40:15,838 --> 00:40:20,358
which is how they're commonly sewn we

996
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:22,280
take Vigor ratings in fall and spring

997
00:40:20,358 --> 00:40:24,920
percent stand in fall and spring to

998
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:27,400
gauge Winter survival and then biomass

999
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:29,599
harvest in a reasonably appropriate time

1000
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:32,280
for each

1001
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:35,400
site the best Advanced line trials go

1002
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:37,160
into mixed legum tral plots to more

1003
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:39,599
accurately reflect the way they would be

1004
00:40:37,159 --> 00:40:41,399
used in the field and then concurrently

1005
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:44,079
with with both levels of advanced line

1006
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:47,119
trials we run C deal trials so that we

1007
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:49,400
can either call lines with low seed

1008
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:51,480
yield despite good field performance or

1009
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:53,200
identify lines with exceptional seed

1010
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:54,519
yield to advance them in the process or

1011
00:40:53,199 --> 00:40:57,480
use them as

1012
00:40:54,519 --> 00:40:59,199
parents then putting it all together to

1013
00:40:57,480 --> 00:41:01,199
breed for cover crop performance we

1014
00:40:59,199 --> 00:41:02,719
start with germplasm sourcing Andor

1015
00:41:01,199 --> 00:41:05,759
development which I'll describe in some

1016
00:41:02,719 --> 00:41:07,639
of these crop specific stories um we

1017
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:09,440
selected in nurseries and then choose

1018
00:41:07,639 --> 00:41:13,239
the best lines for advanced line

1019
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:15,960
trialing the trial plots scale up as the

1020
00:41:13,239 --> 00:41:18,759
lines uh do increasingly well over years

1021
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:21,480
of uh testing currently we run the

1022
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:24,240
seedial trials first in one location uh

1023
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:25,920
Corvalis Oregon is in a major uh seed

1024
00:41:24,239 --> 00:41:27,559
producing region so it's kind of an

1025
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:30,000
ideal seed production environment for

1026
00:41:27,559 --> 00:41:33,199
many crops and then we expand to more

1027
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:36,559
environments to uh try to identify

1028
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:39,480
additional seed production regions uh as

1029
00:41:36,559 --> 00:41:42,599
as lines advance and then finally as we

1030
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:45,280
get to commercialization some stories as

1031
00:41:42,599 --> 00:41:47,240
in the Vex story I'm about to tell we're

1032
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:50,280
satisfied with data from our multi-site

1033
00:41:47,239 --> 00:41:53,719
trials and wanted to move directly to

1034
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:55,960
release some want to uh test material in

1035
00:41:53,719 --> 00:41:58,199
their own trials uh so those are the

1036
00:41:55,960 --> 00:42:00,079
those are the general roots that get to

1037
00:41:58,199 --> 00:42:03,078
commercial

1038
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:05,800
availability so we will start with Harry

1039
00:42:03,079 --> 00:42:08,800
vetch vetch is the best overwinter

1040
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:10,920
annual legume for both winter survival

1041
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:13,079
and nitrogen fixation but it has a

1042
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:16,318
reputation as some of you might

1043
00:42:13,079 --> 00:42:19,000
know it can get massive and viny which

1044
00:42:16,318 --> 00:42:20,800
is great if you have the equipment and

1045
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:22,838
the timing to kill it when it needs to

1046
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:24,240
be killed it is less great if you don't

1047
00:42:22,838 --> 00:42:26,440
have either of those

1048
00:42:24,239 --> 00:42:29,239
things and it has that fraction of hard

1049
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:32,318
seed that and is prone to pod shatter

1050
00:42:29,239 --> 00:42:34,239
which allows uh vetch to become a weed

1051
00:42:32,318 --> 00:42:37,000
um in certain cropping

1052
00:42:34,239 --> 00:42:40,399
systems that is an insect pollinated

1053
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:42,440
outcrossing highly heterozygous species

1054
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:45,800
such that uh the varieties I talk about

1055
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:49,079
or even the lines are open

1056
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:51,440
pollinated the CCB vet breeding program

1057
00:42:49,079 --> 00:42:53,760
has been led by Lisa kissen kusk and

1058
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:56,760
Heathcliff r at the ARs Dairy forage

1059
00:42:53,760 --> 00:43:00,599
Research Unit in Wisconsin they started

1060
00:42:56,760 --> 00:43:03,640
with at six nurseries in 2016 they did

1061
00:43:00,599 --> 00:43:06,720
had a wide germplasm search uh pulling

1062
00:43:03,639 --> 00:43:09,799
in germ plasm from Russia Ukraine Serbia

1063
00:43:06,719 --> 00:43:12,199
China Iran France breeding populations

1064
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:14,039
from the Upper Midwest a couple of VNS

1065
00:43:12,199 --> 00:43:16,199
varieties from seed companies even a

1066
00:43:14,039 --> 00:43:18,599
farmer maintained land race from North

1067
00:43:16,199 --> 00:43:20,838
Dakota their goal was to find the most

1068
00:43:18,599 --> 00:43:22,760
genetic diversity possible in the hope

1069
00:43:20,838 --> 00:43:25,000
that these uh variation for these traits

1070
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:27,520
they cared about uh wither hardiness

1071
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:31,079
biomass Vigor early flowering would be

1072
00:43:27,519 --> 00:43:33,838
in there uh nurseries are planted uh

1073
00:43:31,079 --> 00:43:36,640
replicated and space planted in multiple

1074
00:43:33,838 --> 00:43:39,000
locations using the Vigor and winter

1075
00:43:36,639 --> 00:43:41,480
survival data provided by each location

1076
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:43,960
Lisa selects um among families and

1077
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:45,838
within families for the best plants seed

1078
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:48,599
is harvested from every plant and then a

1079
00:43:45,838 --> 00:43:51,000
balanced bulk uh of seed is made from

1080
00:43:48,599 --> 00:43:53,760
all the harvested plants to

1081
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:55,838
comprise uh the line that is then

1082
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:58,400
entered into advanced line trials so

1083
00:43:55,838 --> 00:44:00,400
this is a fairly uh traditional forage

1084
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:03,960
breeding process but it has been

1085
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:05,280
successful in um uh achieving a couple

1086
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:07,960
of upcoming

1087
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:09,720
releases this is the first one this will

1088
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:11,800
be available through Mountain View seeds

1089
00:44:09,719 --> 00:44:14,719
which is a wholesale or tier one

1090
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:17,559
distributor starting in 2025 if all

1091
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:20,159
things go well this population was

1092
00:44:17,559 --> 00:44:23,400
selected in our 2017 early maturing

1093
00:44:20,159 --> 00:44:26,318
vetch Nursery in North Carolina the

1094
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:28,480
table here is composed of data from uh

1095
00:44:26,318 --> 00:44:30,599
about 50 years years or 50 sight years

1096
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:33,039
of advanced line trials and all of the

1097
00:44:30,599 --> 00:44:36,400
numbers are represented as a percentage

1098
00:44:33,039 --> 00:44:39,079
of the best check which is au Merit so

1099
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:41,039
you'll see that biomass Winter survival

1100
00:44:39,079 --> 00:44:43,000
and early flowering are comparable for

1101
00:44:41,039 --> 00:44:46,318
the best check but what really stands

1102
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:50,480
out is a higher seed yield and much

1103
00:44:46,318 --> 00:44:51,920
higher adaptation so uh CCB nitrous is

1104
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:54,000
predicted to be in the top three in

1105
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:57,159
biomass for three times more

1106
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:59,559
environments than Au Merit so this is uh

1107
00:44:57,159 --> 00:45:02,279
this is the power of this broad testing

1108
00:44:59,559 --> 00:45:04,440
Network um that hasn't been available

1109
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:06,800
before for cover crops to detect

1110
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:08,318
varieties that are broadly adapted um at

1111
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:12,318
least for biomass which is the trait

1112
00:45:08,318 --> 00:45:14,279
we're we're talking about um and then

1113
00:45:12,318 --> 00:45:16,719
get them out there to seed

1114
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:18,839
companies our next release that's

1115
00:45:16,719 --> 00:45:21,558
upcoming is with Albert Le seeds which

1116
00:45:18,838 --> 00:45:24,679
is a tier 2 seed company so selling uh

1117
00:45:21,559 --> 00:45:27,000
wholesale and also directly to Farmers

1118
00:45:24,679 --> 00:45:30,879
it focuses on the Upper Midwest and

1119
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:33,280
Northeast so we at at at seed company's

1120
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:35,880
request we do separate analyses focusing

1121
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:38,359
on various regions so that we can give

1122
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:40,039
them results most relevant to their

1123
00:45:38,358 --> 00:45:44,039
consumers this line was actually

1124
00:45:40,039 --> 00:45:45,519
selected here at Cornell in 2018 um and

1125
00:45:44,039 --> 00:45:48,039
it's very well adapted for winter

1126
00:45:45,519 --> 00:45:51,039
survival and biomass in in this sales

1127
00:45:48,039 --> 00:45:53,880
area in addition seed uh yield is about

1128
00:45:51,039 --> 00:45:55,199
20% better than auit so you can see that

1129
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:58,640
seed deal is something that seed

1130
00:45:55,199 --> 00:46:00,480
companies are gravitating toward not

1131
00:45:58,639 --> 00:46:03,078
mysteriously our multi-environment

1132
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:04,960
trials have also lent some insights uh

1133
00:46:03,079 --> 00:46:08,039
regarding trait relationships in Harry

1134
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:11,039
vetch so after analyzing data from about

1135
00:46:08,039 --> 00:46:13,119
50 uh site-year environments we found

1136
00:46:11,039 --> 00:46:15,519
high and very significant correlations

1137
00:46:13,119 --> 00:46:17,920
between uh several of our most important

1138
00:46:15,519 --> 00:46:20,280
traits so fall Vigor spring Vigor

1139
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:21,838
biomass we also found that biomass

1140
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:24,319
correlates moderately with Winter

1141
00:46:21,838 --> 00:46:25,719
survival and all of this is great

1142
00:46:24,318 --> 00:46:28,759
because we don't have to make big

1143
00:46:25,719 --> 00:46:31,558
tradeoffs between these important traits

1144
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:33,800
the only tradeoff we found is um in

1145
00:46:31,559 --> 00:46:36,240
yellow there so that's winter survival

1146
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:39,200
and early Vigor so we could face a

1147
00:46:36,239 --> 00:46:42,639
challenge selecting for both um early

1148
00:46:39,199 --> 00:46:46,318
flowering and winter survival

1149
00:46:42,639 --> 00:46:49,799
um Lisa kissen kusk who did Led This

1150
00:46:46,318 --> 00:46:51,920
research also analyzed environment

1151
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:55,160
environmental genetic and G by

1152
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:57,119
components of each trait and you'll

1153
00:46:55,159 --> 00:47:01,199
notice that the the blue bar which is

1154
00:46:57,119 --> 00:47:03,240
the Environmental portion is uh vastly

1155
00:47:01,199 --> 00:47:06,439
larger than the the pink and orange

1156
00:47:03,239 --> 00:47:11,519
portions which are the genetic and gby

1157
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:14,559
effects but she then overlaid um or

1158
00:47:11,519 --> 00:47:19,318
Associated um weather and soil factors

1159
00:47:14,559 --> 00:47:21,359
and found uh Salient drivers of um

1160
00:47:19,318 --> 00:47:23,920
various components for various traits so

1161
00:47:21,358 --> 00:47:26,598
for example the environmental component

1162
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:28,318
of freezing degree of winter survival is

1163
00:47:26,599 --> 00:47:30,559
driven by freezing degree days without

1164
00:47:28,318 --> 00:47:31,519
snow cover isn't really a surprise to

1165
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:35,160
any of us who have worked with

1166
00:47:31,519 --> 00:47:36,440
overwintering crops snow protects crops

1167
00:47:35,159 --> 00:47:39,078
so if you have snow cover it can get

1168
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:40,800
really cold and more crops will emerge

1169
00:47:39,079 --> 00:47:42,559
undamaged but when you have those really

1170
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:46,599
cold temperatures without snow

1171
00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:49,280
protection um that's when a lot of crops

1172
00:47:46,599 --> 00:47:52,160
struggle we also saw that the G bye

1173
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:55,519
component of biomass was related to sand

1174
00:47:52,159 --> 00:47:57,598
content so lines having variable

1175
00:47:55,519 --> 00:47:59,679
performance some doing very very well in

1176
00:47:57,599 --> 00:48:03,440
Sandy soils some doing very poorly in

1177
00:47:59,679 --> 00:48:05,679
vice versa um so these

1178
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:08,039
insights this analysis is done we're

1179
00:48:05,679 --> 00:48:12,480
doing similar ones for winter pea and

1180
00:48:08,039 --> 00:48:15,159
crimson clover these help us um better

1181
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:16,960
Define our trialing environments and our

1182
00:48:15,159 --> 00:48:20,000
breeding environments so that we can

1183
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:21,400
identify um whether we call the mega

1184
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:23,920
environments

1185
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:26,559
or environmental groups that are

1186
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:28,400
relevant to breed together to um you

1187
00:48:26,559 --> 00:48:30,400
know constraint genetic variation in

1188
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:33,800
strategic ways instead of trying to

1189
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:39,119
breed for um the whole environment

1190
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:39,119
portraits where uh G by is highly

1191
00:48:39,639 --> 00:48:44,799
influential in addition thanks to more

1192
00:48:42,838 --> 00:48:47,239
work from the USDA Dairy Forge Research

1193
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:49,880
Center in Wisconsin we can leverage a

1194
00:48:47,239 --> 00:48:51,959
new reference genome for Harry vetch

1195
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:55,280
Harry vet is in the visia genus of the

1196
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:59,079
fabas family faas also includes peas and

1197
00:48:55,280 --> 00:49:01,880
beans and many more species um

1198
00:48:59,079 --> 00:49:03,880
genuses the first chromosome level Visa

1199
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:06,440
genus was for common vetch or visia

1200
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:11,160
sativa that was published just in

1201
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:14,400
2022 uh but that species is

1202
00:49:11,159 --> 00:49:16,798
um self-pollinating and highly

1203
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:19,318
homozygous the vet genome was assembled

1204
00:49:16,798 --> 00:49:22,400
just this past year in 2023 from long

1205
00:49:19,318 --> 00:49:25,239
read sequences and is just published it

1206
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:26,880
used a clonally propagated individual of

1207
00:49:25,239 --> 00:49:30,598
au Merit which you remember was the the

1208
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:33,519
best check from our uh field trials it

1209
00:49:30,599 --> 00:49:35,400
showed about 30 time 35 times more

1210
00:49:33,519 --> 00:49:36,920
heterozygosity than the common vetch

1211
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:39,400
genome and worked much better for

1212
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:41,920
alignment of long read sequences from

1213
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:45,798
hary vetch

1214
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:48,240
so using that resource Neil tulo who's a

1215
00:49:45,798 --> 00:49:50,759
research associate with doctors Ry and

1216
00:49:48,239 --> 00:49:53,879
kiss and kusk started work to get at the

1217
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:56,440
weediness of V so hard seed and pod

1218
00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:58,039
shatter in other legume crops both of

1219
00:49:56,440 --> 00:50:00,480
those traits have been found to

1220
00:49:58,039 --> 00:50:02,960
associate with one or a few uh large

1221
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:04,519
effect Losi which then lend themselves

1222
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:06,039
to Mark assisted selection so they

1223
00:50:04,519 --> 00:50:08,719
thought let's see if we can find that in

1224
00:50:06,039 --> 00:50:10,920
Harry vetch they genotyped about a

1225
00:50:08,719 --> 00:50:13,719
thousand vet plants from 80 common

1226
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:16,760
maternal parents through those seed uh

1227
00:50:13,719 --> 00:50:19,558
grew those plants in two environments

1228
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:21,799
and they found a 68% reliability related

1229
00:50:19,559 --> 00:50:23,880
to heritability for seed normany which

1230
00:50:21,798 --> 00:50:25,880
again is great news to breeders we can

1231
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:28,480
potentially do something about hard seed

1232
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:32,760
percentage in vet

1233
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:36,119
um Neil found a large effect Loi on

1234
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:37,440
chromosome one and is proceeding to or

1235
00:50:36,119 --> 00:50:40,000
they they have developed a high

1236
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:43,039
throughput PCR phenotyping

1237
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:46,519
system to genotype you know young germ

1238
00:50:43,039 --> 00:50:48,159
plasm our first soft seed nurseries

1239
00:50:46,519 --> 00:50:51,039
generated with the system will go in

1240
00:50:48,159 --> 00:50:54,879
this fall which is really exciting

1241
00:50:51,039 --> 00:50:57,119
um a manual hard seed test takes about

1242
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:59,480
30 minutes per sample so this is a huge

1243
00:50:57,119 --> 00:51:02,880
Improvement in being able to detect germ

1244
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:04,318
plasm that uh could be favorable for uh

1245
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:06,760
for soft

1246
00:51:04,318 --> 00:51:11,199
seed we found that either one or two

1247
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:16,200
copies of this Gene is effective

1248
00:51:11,199 --> 00:51:20,719
um but no qtl were found for uh pod

1249
00:51:16,199 --> 00:51:23,318
shatter so the next step was to look at

1250
00:51:20,719 --> 00:51:28,000
different uh veter plasm pools and hope

1251
00:51:23,318 --> 00:51:32,920
to both uh validate that h L and maybe

1252
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:35,199
find some uh some qtl that were present

1253
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:37,838
with lower Al little frequency for pod

1254
00:51:35,199 --> 00:51:39,358
shatter so they used pooled

1255
00:51:37,838 --> 00:51:42,558
phenotypically

1256
00:51:39,358 --> 00:51:44,960
contrasting uh DNA samples from four

1257
00:51:42,559 --> 00:51:48,960
site years not used in that previous

1258
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:53,240
study and they did find six qtl for pod

1259
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:55,880
dehis no for for qtl for pod deiss

1260
00:51:53,239 --> 00:51:58,039
unfortunately uh they worked in the

1261
00:51:55,880 --> 00:52:01,559
wrong direction so they made pods more

1262
00:51:58,039 --> 00:52:04,480
prone to shatter instead of less but uh

1263
00:52:01,559 --> 00:52:07,880
as Neil said turns out science is hard

1264
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:11,480
they also found um they also found six

1265
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:13,400
qtl for uh seed dorcy which they'll

1266
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:15,639
continue to explore but notably you

1267
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:20,838
don't see that you see no Peaks on

1268
00:52:15,639 --> 00:52:23,838
chromosome one uh so as we know um these

1269
00:52:20,838 --> 00:52:25,798
Association studies are um dependent on

1270
00:52:23,838 --> 00:52:27,039
The Germ plasm used the environments

1271
00:52:25,798 --> 00:52:29,079
they're grown in

1272
00:52:27,039 --> 00:52:30,719
um maybe even sequencing techniques or

1273
00:52:29,079 --> 00:52:34,480
sequencing

1274
00:52:30,719 --> 00:52:36,480
runs what Neil and uh Heathcliff and

1275
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:39,639
Lisa are discovering though that is not

1276
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:41,240
published yet they they think that the

1277
00:52:39,639 --> 00:52:44,639
major marker that they found before is

1278
00:52:41,239 --> 00:52:47,479
associated with a haet type that um

1279
00:52:44,639 --> 00:52:49,159
was uh present in either very low

1280
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:52,000
frequency or not at all in these

1281
00:52:49,159 --> 00:52:55,480
populations and that it still um is

1282
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:57,400
important for uh soft seed the closest

1283
00:52:55,480 --> 00:52:59,719
marker

1284
00:52:57,400 --> 00:53:03,318
that with fairly High significance in

1285
00:52:59,719 --> 00:53:05,358
this study uh did show that it was being

1286
00:53:03,318 --> 00:53:08,440
selected down over years in our breeding

1287
00:53:05,358 --> 00:53:10,598
program through those manual slow tests

1288
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:12,240
so hopefully we have honed in on an

1289
00:53:10,599 --> 00:53:14,160
important region although we certainly

1290
00:53:12,239 --> 00:53:17,118
haven't told the whole story with that

1291
00:53:14,159 --> 00:53:20,078
one large effect Lo

1292
00:53:17,119 --> 00:53:22,599
Locus and finally a bonus of starting to

1293
00:53:20,079 --> 00:53:24,079
investigate the harvet genome was

1294
00:53:22,599 --> 00:53:28,280
discovering this

1295
00:53:24,079 --> 00:53:30,559
outgroup uh PCA revealed that um there

1296
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:33,000
are two major subpopulations in our

1297
00:53:30,559 --> 00:53:34,960
breeding program the germplasm in this

1298
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:37,519
outgroup is dried from just a few

1299
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:40,760
parents including uh purple Bounty which

1300
00:53:37,519 --> 00:53:43,239
is a widely sewn vetch cultivar that

1301
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:44,760
that we well that has been called Harry

1302
00:53:43,239 --> 00:53:47,479
vetch

1303
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:50,480
um but these individuals are pretty

1304
00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:52,960
distantly related to the Visa vosa or

1305
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:55,280
harvet genome and they also appear not

1306
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:57,960
to cross-pollinate with this core

1307
00:53:55,280 --> 00:54:01,079
population um we consulted a legume

1308
00:53:57,960 --> 00:54:03,240
expert at the University of Miami Ohio

1309
00:54:01,079 --> 00:54:05,079
or barium and he gave us a few possible

1310
00:54:03,239 --> 00:54:08,399
species that this could belonged to but

1311
00:54:05,079 --> 00:54:10,920
didn't make a definitive ID um we're

1312
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:12,480
calling it smooth vetch just because

1313
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:14,920
it's smooth it has much less H

1314
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:17,679
pubescence it's generally uh more

1315
00:54:14,920 --> 00:54:20,039
determinate earlier to flower um so it

1316
00:54:17,679 --> 00:54:23,078
has some beneficial traits but it's not

1317
00:54:20,039 --> 00:54:24,599
hay vetch and it's not Crossing with our

1318
00:54:23,079 --> 00:54:27,920
hary vet so we're taking it out of our

1319
00:54:24,599 --> 00:54:31,200
breeding populations um

1320
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:32,720
um we feel like this is a great example

1321
00:54:31,199 --> 00:54:34,558
of what happens when you start to

1322
00:54:32,719 --> 00:54:35,838
leverage genomic tools for these species

1323
00:54:34,559 --> 00:54:38,519
that just haven't received much

1324
00:54:35,838 --> 00:54:42,239
attention there's a lot we can discover

1325
00:54:38,519 --> 00:54:45,639
that um has just not been on our radar

1326
00:54:42,239 --> 00:54:48,598
before okay shifting gears to a

1327
00:54:45,639 --> 00:54:51,118
self-pollinated legum winter PE winter

1328
00:54:48,599 --> 00:54:54,318
peas are not uh quite as winter hearty

1329
00:54:51,119 --> 00:54:56,480
as winter vet parentheses yet but uh

1330
00:54:54,318 --> 00:54:58,318
they do make a nitrogen contribution and

1331
00:54:56,480 --> 00:55:01,079
they're reliably soft seated so there's

1332
00:54:58,318 --> 00:55:04,279
no uh weediness issue with

1333
00:55:01,079 --> 00:55:05,960
PE thus far the CCB PE breeding program

1334
00:55:04,280 --> 00:55:08,240
has worked uh primarily with Rebecca

1335
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:10,639
McGee who's the usdi dry pulse breeder

1336
00:55:08,239 --> 00:55:12,879
out in pulman Washington and she's

1337
00:55:10,639 --> 00:55:14,318
provided crosses that show promise or

1338
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:17,240
that she feels are promising for the

1339
00:55:14,318 --> 00:55:18,798
traits we care about uh the CCB breeding

1340
00:55:17,239 --> 00:55:21,000
program most of the work I'll be talking

1341
00:55:18,798 --> 00:55:23,480
about has been led by La bastos Martins

1342
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:24,440
now of ceva uh when she was a grad

1343
00:55:23,480 --> 00:55:26,838
student at

1344
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:28,838
NCSU um and then it's recently been

1345
00:55:26,838 --> 00:55:31,358
handed over to

1346
00:55:28,838 --> 00:55:33,679
me so these segregating crosses that

1347
00:55:31,358 --> 00:55:36,000
we've received from Rebecca are planted

1348
00:55:33,679 --> 00:55:38,480
in both research nurseries and on Farm

1349
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:40,599
nurseries in some cases winter does all

1350
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:41,440
of the selection we just keep everything

1351
00:55:40,599 --> 00:55:43,160
that

1352
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:44,760
survives when we don't have much

1353
00:55:43,159 --> 00:55:47,639
winterkill we select on those important

1354
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:49,680
traits bigger biomass again we make

1355
00:55:47,639 --> 00:55:51,400
selections among then within families

1356
00:55:49,679 --> 00:55:53,719
the best lines are increased and

1357
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:56,318
advanced to our Advanced line

1358
00:55:53,719 --> 00:55:59,159
trials our Advanced line testing Network

1359
00:55:56,318 --> 00:56:02,239
work has allowed us to identify regions

1360
00:55:59,159 --> 00:56:04,038
uh where PE Survival is low but not zero

1361
00:56:02,239 --> 00:56:06,919
and then to strategically use those

1362
00:56:04,039 --> 00:56:10,640
areas for selection so that green circle

1363
00:56:06,920 --> 00:56:13,159
up there is where uh Winter survival is

1364
00:56:10,639 --> 00:56:14,598
less than 50% but not zero so that's

1365
00:56:13,159 --> 00:56:17,519
where we're concentrating our on Farm

1366
00:56:14,599 --> 00:56:19,440
nurseries so we can uh leverage both

1367
00:56:17,519 --> 00:56:22,000
those cold environments and those

1368
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:24,519
Farmers many of whom are farmer breeders

1369
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:26,798
uh for their their their eye their

1370
00:56:24,519 --> 00:56:28,159
experienced eye and a couple of

1371
00:56:26,798 --> 00:56:30,199
selections that I'll talk about in a

1372
00:56:28,159 --> 00:56:31,879
moment uh came from those on Farm

1373
00:56:30,199 --> 00:56:34,279
Nursery so the best performing lines we

1374
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:36,358
have so far are are those from the

1375
00:56:34,280 --> 00:56:39,200
participatory breeding

1376
00:56:36,358 --> 00:56:41,920
program so this analysis was also done

1377
00:56:39,199 --> 00:56:45,960
for Albert Lee seeds so it involves uh

1378
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:49,760
it includes sites in the Midwest and

1379
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:52,159
Northeast wo winter is the was the best

1380
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:54,440
uh best name check overall so that's set

1381
00:56:52,159 --> 00:56:57,719
at 100% and everything else is compared

1382
00:56:54,440 --> 00:56:59,079
to W winter you'll see see this tradeoff

1383
00:56:57,719 --> 00:57:02,679
can I figure out how to use this yeah

1384
00:56:59,079 --> 00:57:06,160
there we go so between lower fall Vigor

1385
00:57:02,679 --> 00:57:08,078
and then higher winter survival biomass

1386
00:57:06,159 --> 00:57:10,239
spring Vigor that's that's a common

1387
00:57:08,079 --> 00:57:14,160
trade-off in Plants right so plants keep

1388
00:57:10,239 --> 00:57:17,479
their growth small um before the cold

1389
00:57:14,159 --> 00:57:19,558
season um which allows them to

1390
00:57:17,480 --> 00:57:21,159
concentrate metabolites and do all those

1391
00:57:19,559 --> 00:57:24,039
winter hardiness things and then they

1392
00:57:21,159 --> 00:57:26,639
really grow the next year but we're not

1393
00:57:24,039 --> 00:57:28,680
seeing that tradeoff in these top two

1394
00:57:26,639 --> 00:57:30,598
lines so they're showing really nice

1395
00:57:28,679 --> 00:57:33,279
fall Vigor and they're still surviving

1396
00:57:30,599 --> 00:57:35,160
the winter showing good spring Vigor and

1397
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:37,960
putting on nice biomass in the spring so

1398
00:57:35,159 --> 00:57:40,318
that's exciting the first one is being

1399
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:43,280
picked up by Albert Le seeds the second

1400
00:57:40,318 --> 00:57:45,119
one um is since it's a farmer bread line

1401
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:47,480
and this farmer runs a small seed

1402
00:57:45,119 --> 00:57:50,318
company he's going to be the primary uh

1403
00:57:47,480 --> 00:57:53,039
licensee on the PVP and he'll either do

1404
00:57:50,318 --> 00:57:55,400
all the seed uh distribution itself or

1405
00:57:53,039 --> 00:57:57,280
maybe subl licens to another Seed

1406
00:57:55,400 --> 00:58:01,160
Company so this is one of the ways that

1407
00:57:57,280 --> 00:58:05,880
we're trying to um Place improved Germ

1408
00:58:01,159 --> 00:58:05,879
plasm at multiple points in in the seed

1409
00:58:06,519 --> 00:58:10,639
system our Network allows trialing in

1410
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:12,760
many environments but there are only a

1411
00:58:10,639 --> 00:58:15,719
few of our locations that are cold

1412
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:18,400
enough to really test Winter survival so

1413
00:58:15,719 --> 00:58:20,919
to increase our insights into Winter

1414
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:24,200
survival of these peas and to introduce

1415
00:58:20,920 --> 00:58:25,920
Farmers to our lines and the idea of

1416
00:58:24,199 --> 00:58:27,879
growing peas as an over winter cover

1417
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:30,000
crop crop in general we're planning

1418
00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:32,559
small scale on Farm trials with about 60

1419
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:35,358
Growers this fall we're going to use

1420
00:58:32,559 --> 00:58:39,359
seed linked trialing software which is a

1421
00:58:35,358 --> 00:58:41,480
participatory um a participatory variety

1422
00:58:39,358 --> 00:58:45,038
testing software and we'll Supply each

1423
00:58:41,480 --> 00:58:49,079
grower with three or four lines a mix of

1424
00:58:45,039 --> 00:58:50,640
commercial lines and CCB developed lines

1425
00:58:49,079 --> 00:58:53,440
these will be small plots like about the

1426
00:58:50,639 --> 00:58:56,558
size of those Advanced line trials um so

1427
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:59,639
a good bit for vegetable Growers um even

1428
00:58:56,559 --> 00:59:01,240
sub gardeners with substantial plots um

1429
00:58:59,639 --> 00:59:03,400
people with single row Planters or the

1430
00:59:01,239 --> 00:59:06,000
patients to plant by hand are who we're

1431
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:07,720
looking for um and we're excited to both

1432
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:10,440
expand our network of Growers especially

1433
00:59:07,719 --> 00:59:11,798
to that smaller grower crowd many of the

1434
00:59:10,440 --> 00:59:13,200
Growers that we've been working with

1435
00:59:11,798 --> 00:59:15,358
with cover cropping you know to get to

1436
00:59:13,199 --> 00:59:18,078
40 million Acres you need people who are

1437
00:59:15,358 --> 00:59:19,838
operating a lot of Acres but cover crops

1438
00:59:18,079 --> 00:59:21,798
have a really important place in smaller

1439
00:59:19,838 --> 00:59:23,440
scale farming as well and this is one of

1440
00:59:21,798 --> 00:59:25,759
the ways that we can start making those

1441
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:28,119
connections and learning whether smaller

1442
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:29,440
Farm have different needs than larger

1443
00:59:28,119 --> 00:59:31,358
farmers do we need to be breeding for

1444
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:33,519
different objectives or is it more an

1445
00:59:31,358 --> 00:59:36,798
education and extension game about

1446
00:59:33,519 --> 00:59:39,960
getting people familiar with these

1447
00:59:36,798 --> 00:59:42,079
practices and finally we are seeking new

1448
00:59:39,960 --> 00:59:45,000
germ plasm that's better adapted for

1449
00:59:42,079 --> 00:59:47,480
both low temperatures and freeze thaw or

1450
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:48,960
acclamation and de acclamation to Cold

1451
00:59:47,480 --> 00:59:51,000
Steve mky from the University of

1452
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:53,480
Minnesota has led the work on this front

1453
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:57,519
using growth Chambers to screen for

1454
00:59:53,480 --> 01:00:00,039
freezing tolerance he subjects these for

1455
00:59:57,519 --> 01:00:03,559
p seedlings to a cycle of cold then

1456
01:00:00,039 --> 01:00:07,720
Sub-Zero acclamation then uh freeze down

1457
01:00:03,559 --> 01:00:11,920
to uh -12 Celsius and then a recovery

1458
01:00:07,719 --> 01:00:14,879
and scores uh damage on a scale of 0 to

1459
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:17,599
five from no damage to complete

1460
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:19,760
death he started a breeding program with

1461
01:00:17,599 --> 01:00:21,838
the most freeze tolerant accessions and

1462
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:24,599
ran field tests through Minnesota

1463
01:00:21,838 --> 01:00:27,838
winters and found a pretty impressive

1464
01:00:24,599 --> 01:00:30,039
range of variation from from uh zero

1465
01:00:27,838 --> 01:00:32,440
survival to almost

1466
01:00:30,039 --> 01:00:34,520
100% he selected the lines with more

1467
01:00:32,440 --> 01:00:37,240
than 60%

1468
01:00:34,519 --> 01:00:40,239
survival um then selected further on

1469
01:00:37,239 --> 01:00:43,358
seed Coke characteristics and so these

1470
01:00:40,239 --> 01:00:46,279
F34 lines here are currently currently

1471
01:00:43,358 --> 01:00:47,920
planted in his Nursery at Minnesota just

1472
01:00:46,280 --> 01:00:50,000
was corresponding by email with him and

1473
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:52,039
he said that about 5% of them are

1474
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:54,318
surviving they had they had a very low

1475
01:00:52,039 --> 01:00:57,160
snow winter which is and and very cold

1476
01:00:54,318 --> 01:00:58,679
so these are great selection conditions

1477
01:00:57,159 --> 01:01:01,558
um and then we have some of the more

1478
01:00:58,679 --> 01:01:03,159
promising F2 derived F3 families in our

1479
01:01:01,559 --> 01:01:06,960
Nursery here and on those unarm

1480
01:01:03,159 --> 01:01:09,199
nurseries in cold zone so we'll see what

1481
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:12,480
happens finally I was really impressed

1482
01:01:09,199 --> 01:01:15,318
with this figure which Compares these F3

1483
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:18,159
families with the F3 derived F4 families

1484
01:01:15,318 --> 01:01:20,880
so these are parents and progeny in the

1485
01:01:18,159 --> 01:01:24,480
f3s we're seeing very few individuals

1486
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:27,760
per family Z zero to maybe a few with no

1487
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:30,679
damage after this freezing protocol in

1488
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:33,200
the Next Generation we're seeing um you

1489
01:01:30,679 --> 01:01:36,358
know up to a third of individuals within

1490
01:01:33,199 --> 01:01:38,558
families seeing no damage after uh the

1491
01:01:36,358 --> 01:01:40,598
freeze thaw protocol and many more with

1492
01:01:38,559 --> 01:01:43,359
intermediate scores you can see the the

1493
01:01:40,599 --> 01:01:46,160
numeric scores remembering that low

1494
01:01:43,358 --> 01:01:47,759
scores are better in this case um so

1495
01:01:46,159 --> 01:01:50,038
this is really exciting progress and

1496
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:54,000
we're exciting to keep working toward

1497
01:01:50,039 --> 01:01:56,440
this especially as freeze thaw becomes

1498
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:58,639
more uh prevalent AC cross more

1499
01:01:56,440 --> 01:02:00,400
locations um we're seeing it we saw it

1500
01:01:58,639 --> 01:02:02,798
in Corvalis Oregon this year the

1501
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:04,240
midatlantic is seeing it more as weather

1502
01:02:02,798 --> 01:02:07,880
becomes more volatile this will be a

1503
01:02:04,239 --> 01:02:10,399
more important trait um for us to

1504
01:02:07,880 --> 01:02:14,838
consider and last but definitely not

1505
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:17,160
least is um serial Rye which is the most

1506
01:02:14,838 --> 01:02:19,278
uh widely grown cover crop for its

1507
01:02:17,159 --> 01:02:21,118
ability to tolerate late sewing when

1508
01:02:19,278 --> 01:02:24,318
nothing else will grow in the fall cial

1509
01:02:21,119 --> 01:02:26,200
Rye will probably grow it's cold hardtin

1510
01:02:24,318 --> 01:02:27,440
and it's abundant biomass production in

1511
01:02:26,199 --> 01:02:30,679
the

1512
01:02:27,440 --> 01:02:33,200
spring the CCB breeding program began in

1513
01:02:30,679 --> 01:02:35,440
Earnest last season with the Dual goals

1514
01:02:33,199 --> 01:02:38,480
of breeding specifically for cover crop

1515
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:40,278
use um especially for Northern locations

1516
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:43,240
and also to leverage our North Carolina

1517
01:02:40,278 --> 01:02:46,119
State's team ongoing work on alil apathy

1518
01:02:43,239 --> 01:02:48,358
and Ry at Cornell and at the University

1519
01:02:46,119 --> 01:02:50,680
of Minnesota we started evaluating Pi

1520
01:02:48,358 --> 01:02:53,000
lines that showed promise for cold

1521
01:02:50,679 --> 01:02:56,000
locations um and at NC State they

1522
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:58,000
started work many years ago to identify

1523
01:02:56,000 --> 01:03:02,000
uh Ry lines with high

1524
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:05,519
allopathy so this Ry allopathy Rik andin

1525
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:08,960
compounds benzo zonoids that inhibit the

1526
01:03:05,519 --> 01:03:11,559
germination and growth of uh small seeds

1527
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:14,119
they occur in both roots and chotes uh

1528
01:03:11,559 --> 01:03:17,359
Chris reberg Horton started work about

1529
01:03:14,119 --> 01:03:19,358
20 years ago to identify uh genotype

1530
01:03:17,358 --> 01:03:21,278
specificity of these

1531
01:03:19,358 --> 01:03:25,519
compounds and

1532
01:03:21,278 --> 01:03:29,960
then demk rebong and Alia warus are have

1533
01:03:25,519 --> 01:03:34,920
been working with uh protocols for

1534
01:03:29,960 --> 01:03:36,720
um well the goal of characterizing aathy

1535
01:03:34,920 --> 01:03:38,278
and Ry was to hopefully develop a high

1536
01:03:36,719 --> 01:03:40,399
allopathy Ry that could be used

1537
01:03:38,278 --> 01:03:42,199
strategically for weed suppression and

1538
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:44,480
as a fmer vegetable grower who wanted

1539
01:03:42,199 --> 01:03:47,118
small seeds to grow after my Ry cover

1540
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:51,039
crop uh I know there's a place for a low

1541
01:03:47,119 --> 01:03:55,119
lpath as well so the NC State team

1542
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:58,160
developed an invitro assay to gauge the

1543
01:03:55,119 --> 01:04:00,440
effect of r on an indicator crop and

1544
01:03:58,159 --> 01:04:03,519
also a field assay using lettuce which

1545
01:04:00,440 --> 01:04:06,400
is uh small seated vulnerable to a

1546
01:04:03,519 --> 01:04:08,679
leathy damage um and grows well in North

1547
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:12,838
Carolina Springs which is when Riot goes

1548
01:04:08,679 --> 01:04:14,719
to boot um or to to starting to go to

1549
01:04:12,838 --> 01:04:18,639
head

1550
01:04:14,719 --> 01:04:20,239
uh you will notice that theopathy from

1551
01:04:18,639 --> 01:04:23,798
these Rye plants can either form a

1552
01:04:20,239 --> 01:04:27,719
gradient like so or a ring um

1553
01:04:23,798 --> 01:04:27,719
dramatically termed a Halo of death

1554
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:33,799
so once we

1555
01:04:30,798 --> 01:04:37,278
identify lines with either high or low

1556
01:04:33,798 --> 01:04:40,719
allopathy so the lines in yellow here um

1557
01:04:37,278 --> 01:04:43,358
have high allopathy or a high level of

1558
01:04:40,719 --> 01:04:45,318
uh weed control or surrogate weed

1559
01:04:43,358 --> 01:04:47,558
control and then a few lines with low

1560
01:04:45,318 --> 01:04:50,318
weed control in blue the next step is to

1561
01:04:47,559 --> 01:04:52,559
integress that into Elite germplasm so

1562
01:04:50,318 --> 01:04:54,440
the NC State team has three Advanced

1563
01:04:52,559 --> 01:04:56,200
lines that will start Nationwide testing

1564
01:04:54,440 --> 01:04:57,838
this fall

1565
01:04:56,199 --> 01:05:01,919
they also made crosses between these

1566
01:04:57,838 --> 01:05:05,199
high aathy lines and two winter hearty

1567
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:07,079
varieties um these are hot by Northern

1568
01:05:05,199 --> 01:05:09,358
crosses that will feed into a couple of

1569
01:05:07,079 --> 01:05:09,359
other

1570
01:05:09,838 --> 01:05:17,159
experiments so these will um this is a

1571
01:05:14,358 --> 01:05:20,239
Cornell based program to select Rye for

1572
01:05:17,159 --> 01:05:22,278
improved Cold Soil germination and vigor

1573
01:05:20,239 --> 01:05:24,278
uh with the goal of developing varieties

1574
01:05:22,278 --> 01:05:28,278
that will perform better in those late

1575
01:05:24,278 --> 01:05:31,079
season type plant ing Windows um after

1576
01:05:28,278 --> 01:05:34,039
cash crop harvest in the northern region

1577
01:05:31,079 --> 01:05:36,039
PhD student Rapa um is planting these

1578
01:05:34,039 --> 01:05:39,319
lines both in Northern New York and in

1579
01:05:36,039 --> 01:05:41,079
this thermal gradient table um so she

1580
01:05:39,318 --> 01:05:43,318
can select individuals that emerge just

1581
01:05:41,079 --> 01:05:43,318
above

1582
01:05:43,880 --> 01:05:49,240
freezing and finally the hot Bo Northern

1583
01:05:46,318 --> 01:05:51,199
crosses um are planted in our Nursery

1584
01:05:49,239 --> 01:05:52,598
here at New York and also in Minnesota

1585
01:05:51,199 --> 01:05:55,278
in addition to the selections we made

1586
01:05:52,599 --> 01:05:57,838
last year we will make our selections

1587
01:05:55,278 --> 01:05:59,838
this year harvest the seed send some to

1588
01:05:57,838 --> 01:06:01,880
North Carolina so they can do aathy

1589
01:05:59,838 --> 01:06:04,358
testing which will then inform our

1590
01:06:01,880 --> 01:06:06,079
selections from nurseries next year so

1591
01:06:04,358 --> 01:06:09,239
we can start diverging our group into a

1592
01:06:06,079 --> 01:06:11,640
high allopathy and low allopathy group

1593
01:06:09,239 --> 01:06:13,919
um and an exciting recent development in

1594
01:06:11,639 --> 01:06:17,118
our R program is at Lisa kissing kusk

1595
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:20,079
who's a Cornell grad um and one of the

1596
01:06:17,119 --> 01:06:21,599
powerhouses behind the CCB Vet program

1597
01:06:20,079 --> 01:06:24,480
is starting a new position as a cover

1598
01:06:21,599 --> 01:06:26,798
crop forage breeder uh focusing on rye

1599
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:29,278
still in Wisconsin she'll be taking the

1600
01:06:26,798 --> 01:06:31,719
lead on the CCB the ccb's Ry breeding

1601
01:06:29,278 --> 01:06:35,159
program and starting with identifying

1602
01:06:31,719 --> 01:06:36,919
Rye ideotypes that will serve different

1603
01:06:35,159 --> 01:06:39,078
uh production systems so what

1604
01:06:36,920 --> 01:06:42,440
combination of early and late maturity

1605
01:06:39,079 --> 01:06:45,400
high and low allopathy plaid stature Etc

1606
01:06:42,440 --> 01:06:47,200
will serve um cropping systems in

1607
01:06:45,400 --> 01:06:50,119
different regions of the

1608
01:06:47,199 --> 01:06:52,519
country and different

1609
01:06:50,119 --> 01:06:54,760
crops okay so cover crop breeding

1610
01:06:52,519 --> 01:06:57,199
progress we have new variety releases

1611
01:06:54,760 --> 01:07:00,720
coming in vet and P we have a marker for

1612
01:06:57,199 --> 01:07:02,598
a soft seed we are breeding Rye toward

1613
01:07:00,719 --> 01:07:06,000
um high and low allopathy we're working

1614
01:07:02,599 --> 01:07:08,318
on Cold Soil uh emergence and vigor in

1615
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:10,559
both P well we're working on that in Rye

1616
01:07:08,318 --> 01:07:13,400
and cold tolerance in

1617
01:07:10,559 --> 01:07:15,240
P Frontiers looking like fleshing out

1618
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:16,680
the back half of our breeding pipeline

1619
01:07:15,239 --> 01:07:19,679
so the steps around increase

1620
01:07:16,679 --> 01:07:21,399
commercialization farmer adoption uh we

1621
01:07:19,679 --> 01:07:24,000
are working on expanding seed production

1622
01:07:21,400 --> 01:07:25,760
regions and continuing to grow our

1623
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:28,039
connections with seed companies to to

1624
01:07:25,760 --> 01:07:30,799
add that logistical and financial

1625
01:07:28,039 --> 01:07:33,359
sustainability to cover crop seed

1626
01:07:30,798 --> 01:07:36,358
systems uh remote phenotyping will be

1627
01:07:33,358 --> 01:07:40,239
really helpful to build Rich meaningful

1628
01:07:36,358 --> 01:07:42,038
and less labor intensive data sets uh we

1629
01:07:40,239 --> 01:07:44,358
can breed more specifically for

1630
01:07:42,039 --> 01:07:46,680
intercropping we can look at employing

1631
01:07:44,358 --> 01:07:48,679
genomic selection strategically in ways

1632
01:07:46,679 --> 01:07:50,719
that it makes sense as genomic tools

1633
01:07:48,679 --> 01:07:51,679
come along for um the crops we are

1634
01:07:50,719 --> 01:07:55,759
working

1635
01:07:51,679 --> 01:07:59,639
on so the path to 40 million acres is

1636
01:07:55,760 --> 01:08:01,920
with or perhaps sewn with uh continued

1637
01:07:59,639 --> 01:08:03,639
education networking and creativity

1638
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:06,240
among Growers and

1639
01:08:03,639 --> 01:08:08,400
researchers uh the relationship that

1640
01:08:06,239 --> 01:08:10,318
facilitates all that and continues

1641
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:13,039
building this cover crop seed system

1642
01:08:10,318 --> 01:08:14,960
with diverse points of entry and um

1643
01:08:13,039 --> 01:08:18,119
broad availability of high quality cover

1644
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:21,439
crop seed uh and variety Improvement so

1645
01:08:18,119 --> 01:08:24,000
traditional unglamorous yet effective

1646
01:08:21,439 --> 01:08:26,039
field breeding and multi-side trialing

1647
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:27,838
uh genomic analysis control environment

1648
01:08:26,039 --> 01:08:30,960
work for specific

1649
01:08:27,838 --> 01:08:32,198
traits if you are interested and curious

1650
01:08:30,960 --> 01:08:34,600
about this we're having a couple of

1651
01:08:32,198 --> 01:08:37,919
field walks coming up on April 23rd and

1652
01:08:34,600 --> 01:08:39,759
May 1st um you can snap this page or go

1653
01:08:37,920 --> 01:08:42,239
to that QR code that's our website on

1654
01:08:39,759 --> 01:08:44,238
our events page um there's more

1655
01:08:42,238 --> 01:08:45,759
information uh please come walk and talk

1656
01:08:44,238 --> 01:08:47,519
with us if you're interested we'd love

1657
01:08:45,759 --> 01:08:50,119
to show you what's out

1658
01:08:47,520 --> 01:08:52,719
there thanks to the more lab without

1659
01:08:50,119 --> 01:08:54,838
their Hands-On work in the field and

1660
01:08:52,719 --> 01:08:56,679
handling seed um this would not be

1661
01:08:54,838 --> 01:08:59,000
possible

1662
01:08:56,679 --> 01:09:01,520
and thanks to the CCB Network team um

1663
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:03,719
and our funders uh grateful for the

1664
01:09:01,520 --> 01:09:07,359
chance to talk with you

1665
01:09:03,719 --> 01:09:09,719
all yeah this is about the work your

1666
01:09:07,359 --> 01:09:11,400
collaborator in Minnesota was doing how

1667
01:09:09,719 --> 01:09:13,198
with the field trials for the free stall

1668
01:09:11,399 --> 01:09:15,119
tolerance and winter PE how are they

1669
01:09:13,198 --> 01:09:17,198
distinguishing that phenotype from just

1670
01:09:15,119 --> 01:09:18,880
like winter survival

1671
01:09:17,198 --> 01:09:21,158
scores

1672
01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:23,759
um so so you mean the controlled

1673
01:09:21,158 --> 01:09:25,719
environment phenotype the field when

1674
01:09:23,759 --> 01:09:27,719
they're doing the field trials for fre

1675
01:09:25,719 --> 01:09:29,798
stall now yeah how are they are they

1676
01:09:27,719 --> 01:09:31,719
just going at the end of the season in

1677
01:09:29,798 --> 01:09:33,679
the spring and scoring winner survival

1678
01:09:31,719 --> 01:09:38,079
broadly or are they getting more data

1679
01:09:33,679 --> 01:09:40,119
points along the yeah I I think the um

1680
01:09:38,079 --> 01:09:42,679
the controlled environment trial is to

1681
01:09:40,119 --> 01:09:44,880
select germplasm for for intermating or

1682
01:09:42,679 --> 01:09:47,239
to select what goes into the field and

1683
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:50,719
then whatever conditions happen that

1684
01:09:47,238 --> 01:09:54,319
Season Select for whatever survives um

1685
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:55,719
yeah but it it's it's um you know it's

1686
01:09:54,319 --> 01:10:00,439
Hit or Miss because you know you don't

1687
01:09:55,719 --> 01:10:00,439
know what you're going to get mhm

1688
01:10:05,479 --> 01:10:08,678
yeah good

1689
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:20,479
question that's a great question

1690
01:10:20,640 --> 01:10:27,320
um and Denny you're uh welcome to weigh

1691
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:27,319
in as well

1692
01:10:27,880 --> 01:10:33,640
um I think there is a point at

1693
01:10:31,079 --> 01:10:36,800
which too much is too much in terms of

1694
01:10:33,640 --> 01:10:38,360
say biomass um depending on the cropping

1695
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:40,520
system depending on how they plan to

1696
01:10:38,359 --> 01:10:42,960
terminate it

1697
01:10:40,520 --> 01:10:45,199
um in terms of whether we get to good

1698
01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:49,198
enough and then move

1699
01:10:45,198 --> 01:10:49,198
on yeah

1700
01:11:16,880 --> 01:11:20,880
yeah right

1701
01:11:27,960 --> 01:11:32,800
yeah yeah exactly I think maybe that

1702
01:11:30,479 --> 01:11:36,839
radiation happens with like filling more

1703
01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:39,560
niches um and you know say for vegetable

1704
01:11:36,840 --> 01:11:41,079
Growers which um especially like smaller

1705
01:11:39,560 --> 01:11:45,719
scale Diversified vegetable Growers like

1706
01:11:41,079 --> 01:11:48,840
I was um there could be lines breads for

1707
01:11:45,719 --> 01:11:51,600
for those uh planting and termination

1708
01:11:48,840 --> 01:11:53,440
Windows um that are offered by seed

1709
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:55,760
companies that really Target that market

1710
01:11:53,439 --> 01:11:58,879
that are smaller midsize and maybe maybe

1711
01:11:55,760 --> 01:12:00,560
very regionally adapted um that that

1712
01:11:58,880 --> 01:12:02,480
makes sense to me including some of

1713
01:12:00,560 --> 01:12:04,400
these Workhorse broadly adapted

1714
01:12:02,479 --> 01:12:07,399
varieties that are really widely

1715
01:12:04,399 --> 01:12:07,399
available

1716
01:12:08,479 --> 01:12:11,479
um

1717
01:12:11,800 --> 01:12:14,800
yes

1718
01:12:19,079 --> 01:12:22,639
exactly for

1719
01:12:20,649 --> 01:12:27,079
[Music]

1720
01:12:22,639 --> 01:12:27,079
Iowa Target population

1721
01:12:30,359 --> 01:12:35,079
right and and Ry is really an easier nut

1722
01:12:32,158 --> 01:12:37,119
to crack because it's so widely used and

1723
01:12:35,079 --> 01:12:39,000
it's often used in monoculture so the

1724
01:12:37,119 --> 01:12:42,039
testing is much less complex whereas

1725
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:44,760
legumes are often grown in mixtures with

1726
01:12:42,039 --> 01:12:47,880
various small grains um and are just

1727
01:12:44,760 --> 01:12:49,760
less widely used um than than rye by a

1728
01:12:47,880 --> 01:12:52,319
long shot so it's it's both initial

1729
01:12:49,760 --> 01:12:55,239
adoption of of try this species at all

1730
01:12:52,319 --> 01:12:58,399
and then dialing in what traits Within

1731
01:12:55,238 --> 01:13:02,718
that species are going to optimize the

1732
01:12:58,399 --> 01:13:02,719
system yeah

1733
01:13:09,729 --> 01:13:15,408
[Music]

1734
01:13:23,920 --> 01:13:30,880
yeah I I mean that sounds great

1735
01:13:28,039 --> 01:13:33,840
um there we're only really at the

1736
01:13:30,880 --> 01:13:37,880
beginning of investigating this trait um

1737
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:40,239
so what what we know now is

1738
01:13:37,880 --> 01:13:43,319
allopathy and I believe all tissues of

1739
01:13:40,238 --> 01:13:47,279
the plant is greatest at boot stage or

1740
01:13:43,319 --> 01:13:49,719
when the uh plant starts to uh starts to

1741
01:13:47,279 --> 01:13:53,119
make a head right and and um the head

1742
01:13:49,719 --> 01:13:56,520
emerges from from the leaf sheep

1743
01:13:53,119 --> 01:14:00,800
um in terms of distribution between root

1744
01:13:56,520 --> 01:14:02,760
and chot um in terms of you know some of

1745
01:14:00,800 --> 01:14:05,000
the lines that have been identified as

1746
01:14:02,760 --> 01:14:07,239
hpathy some of our discussion within our

1747
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:09,319
group has been are these lines just

1748
01:14:07,238 --> 01:14:11,439
earlier you know are they just

1749
01:14:09,319 --> 01:14:12,759
phenologically uh more advanced and

1750
01:14:11,439 --> 01:14:14,919
that's why they're producing more of

1751
01:14:12,760 --> 01:14:17,280
this compound

1752
01:14:14,920 --> 01:14:19,158
um we're also seeing we have some

1753
01:14:17,279 --> 01:14:22,319
preliminary results in a greenhouse

1754
01:14:19,158 --> 01:14:24,439
screen um where they grew I think four

1755
01:14:22,319 --> 01:14:27,119
different Ry lines with known different

1756
01:14:24,439 --> 01:14:30,399
levels of pH apathy um harvested the

1757
01:14:27,119 --> 01:14:34,399
chots and then planted uh various

1758
01:14:30,399 --> 01:14:36,799
species of uh crops or weeds and saw

1759
01:14:34,399 --> 01:14:40,638
very different effects on different

1760
01:14:36,800 --> 01:14:43,880
crops um and sometimes like uh riine by

1761
01:14:40,639 --> 01:14:48,199
crop interaction so this is very

1762
01:14:43,880 --> 01:14:50,199
complex and so um yeah we're trying to

1763
01:14:48,198 --> 01:14:53,479
well this is one of L's jobs is to

1764
01:14:50,198 --> 01:14:56,439
figure out um how how do we start to

1765
01:14:53,479 --> 01:14:59,198
parse out these different uh variables

1766
01:14:56,439 --> 01:15:01,119
to figure out how we strategically use

1767
01:14:59,198 --> 01:15:04,719
this trait

1768
01:15:01,119 --> 01:15:07,439
um yeah it's it's it's it's cool and

1769
01:15:04,719 --> 01:15:09,520
Powerful to just like BL the weeds out

1770
01:15:07,439 --> 01:15:11,000
of a field but if you get aathy that

1771
01:15:09,520 --> 01:15:13,000
strong like there is evidence that it

1772
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:16,760
also affects large seeds like corn and

1773
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:21,840
soybeans and like not what we want um so

1774
01:15:16,760 --> 01:15:21,840
yeah it's an interesting one yes

1775
01:15:39,560 --> 01:15:43,960
not right now I know there was

1776
01:15:41,198 --> 01:15:45,919
biological nitrogen fixation data taken

1777
01:15:43,960 --> 01:15:48,119
several years ago and that's how we came

1778
01:15:45,920 --> 01:15:49,800
to that conclusion that nitrogen

1779
01:15:48,119 --> 01:15:52,000
fixation is so highly correlated with

1780
01:15:49,800 --> 01:15:55,360
biomass let's measure biomass because

1781
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:57,719
it's so much easier but in terms of uh

1782
01:15:55,359 --> 01:16:00,359
release over the plants life

1783
01:15:57,719 --> 01:16:01,719
cycle Visa V availability to the next

1784
01:16:00,359 --> 01:16:07,079
Plant I don't believe that's been done

1785
01:16:01,719 --> 01:16:07,079
in like a Time sequence yeah okay

1786
01:16:11,439 --> 01:16:17,319
uhhuh right I believe that most of them

1787
01:16:14,880 --> 01:16:19,199
are for employing the practice so you

1788
01:16:17,319 --> 01:16:22,519
sign up for I'm going to put cover crops

1789
01:16:19,198 --> 01:16:24,000
on 200 Acres somebody from The Soil

1790
01:16:22,520 --> 01:16:26,080
Conservation District comes out and

1791
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:28,520
verifies yes you've done that you get

1792
01:16:26,079 --> 01:16:30,559
your incentive I think some of the

1793
01:16:28,520 --> 01:16:35,080
private programs are starting to try to

1794
01:16:30,560 --> 01:16:35,080
quantify change over time

1795
01:16:39,079 --> 01:16:42,079
you

1796
01:16:47,279 --> 01:16:50,279
yeah

1797
01:16:53,520 --> 01:16:56,840
yes yeah

1798
01:16:59,079 --> 01:17:02,479
right but but that

1799
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:06,600
yeah

1800
01:17:20,039 --> 01:17:25,840
yes yes guidance about our

1801
01:17:30,319 --> 01:17:36,399
the recommendation tools

1802
01:17:33,399 --> 01:17:36,399
yeah

1803
01:17:40,880 --> 01:17:46,679
yep and that there's also some programs

1804
01:17:44,639 --> 01:17:50,239
are designed for new adopters of cover

1805
01:17:46,679 --> 01:17:51,800
cropping some will incentivize people or

1806
01:17:50,238 --> 01:17:54,959
um give them benefits for what they're

1807
01:17:51,800 --> 01:17:57,440
already doing um yeah it's it's very

1808
01:17:54,960 --> 01:17:59,399
diverse and changes every year with

1809
01:17:57,439 --> 01:18:02,399
policy

1810
01:17:59,399 --> 01:18:02,399
yeah

1811
01:18:06,760 --> 01:18:10,400
yeah well this would be jy's willhouse

1812
01:18:09,279 --> 01:18:12,759
because she's been at this for more

1813
01:18:10,399 --> 01:18:15,399
years than me I just came on last year

1814
01:18:12,760 --> 01:18:18,280
so uh from the Department of plant and

1815
01:18:15,399 --> 01:18:21,039
Agro ecosystem uh Sciences at the

1816
01:18:18,279 --> 01:18:23,119
University of wi Wisconsin medicine

1817
01:18:21,039 --> 01:18:27,880
sorry I'm very bad in pronouncing these

1818
01:18:23,119 --> 01:18:30,279
names uh under the ship of Dr e e Wang

1819
01:18:27,880 --> 01:18:32,199
and then uh she her research project

1820
01:18:30,279 --> 01:18:35,479
focuses on uh development of remote

1821
01:18:32,198 --> 01:18:37,839
sensing based decision support models

1822
01:18:35,479 --> 01:18:40,599
for nitrogen management of vegetable

1823
01:18:37,840 --> 01:18:43,400
crops such as dark kidney beans and snap

1824
01:18:40,600 --> 01:18:45,719
beans and today she'll be presenting

1825
01:18:43,399 --> 01:18:48,879
some of her work in the talk uh titled

1826
01:18:45,719 --> 01:18:50,880
Eye in the Sky hyperspectral Imaging for

1827
01:18:48,880 --> 01:18:53,000
sustainable nitrogen Management in

1828
01:18:50,880 --> 01:18:56,719
vegetables uh I would like to welcome

1829
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:56,719
tagir and uh

1830
01:19:08,679 --> 01:19:14,000
already and past research has shown that

1831
01:19:12,158 --> 01:19:15,839
that excessive application of

1832
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:17,880
nitrogenous fertilizers could lead to

1833
01:19:15,840 --> 01:19:20,159
nitrate leeching and groundwater

1834
01:19:17,880 --> 01:19:23,400
contamination excessive application of

1835
01:19:20,158 --> 01:19:25,679
nitrogenous fertilizers also leads to

1836
01:19:23,399 --> 01:19:27,799
increase in the input cost cost the

1837
01:19:25,679 --> 01:19:30,039
graph on this slide represent the change

1838
01:19:27,800 --> 01:19:32,520
in the prices of fertilizers over past

1839
01:19:30,039 --> 01:19:35,039
few years and we could see that after

1840
01:19:32,520 --> 01:19:38,040
the year 2020 there was substantial

1841
01:19:35,039 --> 01:19:40,920
increase in the prices of nitrogenous

1842
01:19:38,039 --> 01:19:43,238
fertilizers this map represent the

1843
01:19:40,920 --> 01:19:46,520
groundwater contamination due to

1844
01:19:43,238 --> 01:19:50,359
nitrates in Wisconsin and Studies have

1845
01:19:46,520 --> 01:19:53,120
shown that 20 to 30% of private Wells

1846
01:19:50,359 --> 01:19:56,000
have nitrate level that exceeds 10

1847
01:19:53,119 --> 01:19:57,719
millgram per liter

1848
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:59,920
excessive application of nitrogen

1849
01:19:57,719 --> 01:20:02,279
fertilizers also increase the disease

1850
01:19:59,920 --> 01:20:04,679
pressure such as white mold in case of

1851
01:20:02,279 --> 01:20:07,479
bit kidney beans and snap beans and

1852
01:20:04,679 --> 01:20:10,239
higher disease pressure reduces the crop

1853
01:20:07,479 --> 01:20:13,319
yield previous study conducted on dry

1854
01:20:10,238 --> 01:20:15,439
beans suggested that that there was

1855
01:20:13,319 --> 01:20:18,359
higher white mold incidence when higher

1856
01:20:15,439 --> 01:20:20,479
nitrogen rate such as 179 kg per hectare

1857
01:20:18,359 --> 01:20:23,399
was

1858
01:20:20,479 --> 01:20:25,759
applied as we know that every human

1859
01:20:23,399 --> 01:20:27,879
being has slightly different

1860
01:20:25,760 --> 01:20:30,480
fingerprints and it is possible to

1861
01:20:27,880 --> 01:20:33,079
identify specific human being those

1862
01:20:30,479 --> 01:20:34,959
fingerprints belong to and we could do

1863
01:20:33,079 --> 01:20:37,840
similar thing with plants even though

1864
01:20:34,960 --> 01:20:41,158
they don't have fingers well the fingers

1865
01:20:37,840 --> 01:20:42,800
I am talking here do not like the the

1866
01:20:41,158 --> 01:20:45,399
fingerprints I'm talking here do not

1867
01:20:42,800 --> 01:20:47,639
start with fingers but with light when

1868
01:20:45,399 --> 01:20:49,399
light fall fall on Plants some of it is

1869
01:20:47,639 --> 01:20:51,199
absorbed by the plant but certain

1870
01:20:49,399 --> 01:20:53,039
portion of the light is reflected back

1871
01:20:51,198 --> 01:20:55,439
into the atmosphere and the

1872
01:20:53,039 --> 01:20:58,158
hyperspectral sensors in installed on

1873
01:20:55,439 --> 01:21:00,198
airplanes or drones or satellites

1874
01:20:58,158 --> 01:21:01,799
capture the light reflected back by the

1875
01:21:00,198 --> 01:21:04,119
plants and provide us with the

1876
01:21:01,800 --> 01:21:06,520
information that some of it we couldn't

1877
01:21:04,119 --> 01:21:09,000
see with a naked eye also known as

1878
01:21:06,520 --> 01:21:11,320
spectral signature the graph on this

1879
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:14,039
slide show the spectral signature of a

1880
01:21:11,319 --> 01:21:16,399
healthy plant shown by darker green line

1881
01:21:14,039 --> 01:21:20,039
is different from spectral signature of

1882
01:21:16,399 --> 01:21:23,158
a nutritionally deficient

1883
01:21:20,039 --> 01:21:25,359
plant crop growth is largely affected by

1884
01:21:23,158 --> 01:21:28,198
the interaction of genetic environment

1885
01:21:25,359 --> 01:21:30,319
and management factors and we are using

1886
01:21:28,198 --> 01:21:32,079
hyperspectral remote sensing to

1887
01:21:30,319 --> 01:21:34,119
understand the spatial variability

1888
01:21:32,079 --> 01:21:36,920
within and across the crop

1889
01:21:34,119 --> 01:21:39,238
Fields the overall objective of our

1890
01:21:36,920 --> 01:21:41,319
research project is to use aial

1891
01:21:39,238 --> 01:21:43,158
hyperspectral remote sensing for

1892
01:21:41,319 --> 01:21:46,000
understanding how snap beans and kidney

1893
01:21:43,158 --> 01:21:47,920
beans respond to nitrogen fertilization

1894
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:50,560
on irrigated sandy

1895
01:21:47,920 --> 01:21:52,639
soil during the first half of the talk I

1896
01:21:50,560 --> 01:21:54,280
will be talking about snap beans and

1897
01:21:52,639 --> 01:21:56,480
during the later part of the talk I will

1898
01:21:54,279 --> 01:21:58,559
be covering kidney beans this is the

1899
01:21:56,479 --> 01:22:00,039
field design of snap beans where we

1900
01:21:58,560 --> 01:22:01,800
applied six different nitrogen

1901
01:22:00,039 --> 01:22:04,760
treatments shown by different colored

1902
01:22:01,800 --> 01:22:06,760
rectangles on the RGB image and we

1903
01:22:04,760 --> 01:22:08,800
applied nitrogen treatments at three

1904
01:22:06,760 --> 01:22:11,560
different growth stages to two different

1905
01:22:08,800 --> 01:22:13,840
cultivars one of which dm88 was a

1906
01:22:11,560 --> 01:22:15,679
nodulating cultivar and second was a

1907
01:22:13,840 --> 01:22:18,760
non-nodulating

1908
01:22:15,679 --> 01:22:21,000

1917
01:22:38,520 --> 01:22:43,679
prediction and all the hyperspectral

1918
01:22:41,079 --> 01:22:46,279

crop yield

1920
01:22:46,560 --> 01:22:51,800
prediction we collected hypers spectral

1921
01:22:48,920 --> 01:22:54,158
images using high-spec sensor by

1922
01:22:51,800 --> 01:22:56,520
installing it on airplane and we

1923
01:22:54,158 --> 01:22:59,279
collected images on weekly

1924
01:22:56,520 --> 01:23:01,639
basis after extracting the reflectance

1925
01:22:59,279 --> 01:23:04,880
values by drawing the polygons using

1926
01:23:01,639 --> 01:23:06,719
qgis software we selected the top 20

1927
01:23:04,880 --> 01:23:08,920
wavelengths that highly correlate with

1928
01:23:06,719 --> 01:23:11,760
the end of the season crop yield and

1929
01:23:08,920 --> 01:23:13,199
inseason nitrogen status of the plant

1930
01:23:11,760 --> 01:23:15,840
and we trained different machine

1931
01:23:13,198 --> 01:23:17,638
learning models by using top 20

1932
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:20,000
wavelengths along with genetic

1933
01:23:17,639 --> 01:23:21,920
environment and management factors the

1934
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:23,600
genetic factors were cultivar

1935
01:23:21,920 --> 01:23:25,399
environmental factors were soil

1936
01:23:23,600 --> 01:23:28,000
temperature PR precipitation Growing

1937
01:23:25,399 --> 01:23:32,039

1939
01:23:32,039 --> 01:23:37,639
planting this slide shows the crop yield

1940
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:39,560
of two different cultivars of snap beans

1941
01:23:37,639 --> 01:23:42,039
we observed that non- nodulating

1942
01:23:39,560 --> 01:23:44,199
cultivar that was Huntington was having

1943
01:23:42,039 --> 01:23:46,840
significantly higher crop yield when

1944
01:23:44,198 --> 01:23:50,000
nitrogen was applied at 112 kg per

1945
01:23:46,840 --> 01:23:52,840
hectare or higher than that however not

1946
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:55,279
dm88 which is a naula cultivar was

1947
01:23:52,840 --> 01:23:59,079
having significantly higher crop CI at

1948
01:23:55,279 --> 01:24:02,158
84 kg nitrogen per hectare that means

1949
01:23:59,079 --> 01:24:04,238
that dm88 could might be fixing nitrogen

1950
01:24:02,158 --> 01:24:06,119
and it needs less application of

1951
01:24:04,238 --> 01:24:09,158
nitrogen

1952
01:24:06,119 --> 01:24:11,158

nitrogen percentage at different growth

1954
01:24:11,158 --> 01:24:16,679
stages of snap bean plants we observed

1955
01:24:14,840 --> 01:24:18,800
that higher nitrogen rates were having

1956
01:24:16,679 --> 01:24:21,079
higher Leaf nitrogen percentage and

1957
01:24:18,800 --> 01:24:23,119
overall Leaf nitrogen percentage

1958
01:24:21,079 --> 01:24:26,119
decreased with increase in the growth of

1959
01:24:23,119 --> 01:24:26,119
plants

1960
01:24:26,319 --> 01:24:30,599
this slide show the spectral signature

1961
01:24:28,520 --> 01:24:34,120
of snap bean plants at six different

1962
01:24:30,600 --> 01:24:36,000
growth stages each craft has six

1963
01:24:34,119 --> 01:24:38,000
different spectral signature curves

1964
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:40,960
representing each nitrogen treatment

1965
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:44,198
ranging from 22 kg nitrogen per hectare

1966
01:24:40,960 --> 01:24:46,840
to 168 kg nitrogen per hectare and the

1967
01:24:44,198 --> 01:24:48,799
x-axis of these crafts is wavelength in

1968
01:24:46,840 --> 01:24:51,239
nanometer which is further subdivided

1969
01:24:48,800 --> 01:24:54,119
into visible near infrared and shortwave

1970
01:24:51,238 --> 01:24:57,118
infrared region the Y AIS is reflectance

1971
01:24:54,118 --> 01:24:59,279
Val values the red bars in these cfts

1972
01:24:57,118 --> 01:25:01,519
represent the top 20 wavelengths highly

1973
01:24:59,279 --> 01:25:03,559
correlating with the crop field we

1974
01:25:01,520 --> 01:25:05,760
observed that this pattern of spectral

1975
01:25:03,560 --> 01:25:07,880
signature changed across the growing

1976
01:25:05,760 --> 01:25:09,880
season since in the beginning of the

1977
01:25:07,880 --> 01:25:12,600
season the reflectance values in the

1978
01:25:09,880 --> 01:25:15,079
near infrared region were not that high

1979
01:25:12,600 --> 01:25:17,520
however they increased substantially

1980
01:25:15,079 --> 01:25:19,760
later in the season also different

1981
01:25:17,520 --> 01:25:22,320
nitrogen treatments were having specific

1982
01:25:19,760 --> 01:25:24,560
spectral signatures the lower nitrogen

1983
01:25:22,319 --> 01:25:26,960
treatments shown by yellow colored Lin L

1984
01:25:24,560 --> 01:25:29,039
were having higher reflectance values in

1985
01:25:26,960 --> 01:25:31,399
the visible and shortwave infrared

1986
01:25:29,039 --> 01:25:33,960
region however the higher nitrogen

1987
01:25:31,399 --> 01:25:36,039
treatments shown by darker green lines

1988
01:25:33,960 --> 01:25:39,760
were having higher reflectance values in

1989
01:25:36,039 --> 01:25:42,760
the near infrared region the red bars

1990
01:25:39,760 --> 01:25:44,920
that correlating with the propi also

1991
01:25:42,760 --> 01:25:47,679
changed at different growth stages they

1992
01:25:44,920 --> 01:25:50,118
were in the uh shortwave infrared region

1993
01:25:47,679 --> 01:25:52,440
in the beginning of the season and they

1994
01:25:50,118 --> 01:25:54,559
shifted to the near infrared and visible

1995
01:25:52,439 --> 01:25:57,759
part of the Spectra in the middle of the

1996
01:25:54,560 --> 01:26:00,639
season and they shifted more into the

1997
01:25:57,760 --> 01:26:02,239
visible part of the uh Spectra later in

1998
01:26:00,639 --> 01:26:05,118
the

1999
01:26:02,238 --> 01:26:06,839
season this table represent the results

2000
01:26:05,118 --> 01:26:08,759
of random forest model which

2001
01:26:06,840 --> 01:26:10,520
outperformed as compared to other

2002
01:26:08,760 --> 01:26:12,679
machine learning models at predicting

2003
01:26:10,520 --> 01:26:15,400
end of the season crw field when it was

2004
01:26:12,679 --> 01:26:18,520
trained using the combinations shown in

2005
01:26:15,399 --> 01:26:20,559
the First Column random forest model

2006
01:26:18,520 --> 01:26:22,920
performed best when it was trained using

2007
01:26:20,560 --> 01:26:24,920
top 20 wavelengths along with genetic

2008
01:26:22,920 --> 01:26:27,239
environment and management factors

2009
01:26:24,920 --> 01:26:29,719
together as compared to all the other

2010
01:26:27,238 --> 01:26:32,319
combinations and our model performed

2011
01:26:29,719 --> 01:26:35,239
really well starting from the V4 to V5

2012
01:26:32,319 --> 01:26:38,238
growth stage meaning that we could use

2013
01:26:35,238 --> 01:26:41,039
the imagery for crop eeld prediction

2014
01:26:38,238 --> 01:26:44,759
very early in the

2015
01:26:41,039 --> 01:26:46,920
season these two images were um used for

2016
01:26:44,760 --> 01:26:50,079
inseason nitrogen prediction and the

2017
01:26:46,920 --> 01:26:52,199
dread bars in these images represent the

2018
01:26:50,079 --> 01:26:54,198
top 20 wavelengths highly correlating

2019
01:26:52,198 --> 01:26:57,198
with the inseason nitrogen percentage

2020
01:26:54,198 --> 01:26:59,719
stage during the season and we observed

2021
01:26:57,198 --> 01:27:01,839
that the uh top 20 wavelengths were in

2022
01:26:59,719 --> 01:27:04,600
the visible and near infrared region at

2023
01:27:01,840 --> 01:27:08,239
42 days after planting and they slightly

2024
01:27:04,600 --> 01:27:10,760
shifted to the right side of the

2025
01:27:08,238 --> 01:27:12,638
Spectra again we observed that random

2026
01:27:10,760 --> 01:27:14,440
forest model performed better as

2027
01:27:12,639 --> 01:27:16,639
compared to other models at predicting

2028
01:27:14,439 --> 01:27:19,079
inseason nitrogen percentage when it was

2029
01:27:16,639 --> 01:27:21,239
trained using top 20 wavelengths along

2030
01:27:19,079 --> 01:27:24,399
with genetic environment and management

2031
01:27:21,238 --> 01:27:27,079
factors and the model performed better

2032
01:27:24,399 --> 01:27:30,079
uh at 42 days after planting as compared

2033
01:27:27,079 --> 01:27:32,600
to 50 days after

2034
01:27:30,079 --> 01:27:35,238
planting this is a field design of

2035
01:27:32,600 --> 01:27:37,000
kidney beams where we applied eight

2036
01:27:35,238 --> 01:27:38,919
different nitrogen treatments to three

2037
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:41,279
different cultivars at three different

2038
01:27:38,920 --> 01:27:41,279
growth

2039
01:27:41,600 --> 01:27:46,679
stages we observed that the crop yield

2040
01:27:44,399 --> 01:27:48,279
response was very much cultivar specific

2041
01:27:46,679 --> 01:27:50,399
since there was no significant

2042
01:27:48,279 --> 01:27:53,079
difference in the crop yield of cultiva

2043
01:27:50,399 --> 01:27:55,559
Dynasty however the crop yield of Red

2044
01:27:53,079 --> 01:27:58,600
Rover and Mont was were significantly

2045
01:27:55,560 --> 01:28:01,560
higher at higher nitrogen

2046
01:27:58,600 --> 01:28:04,280
treatments these three graphs represent

2047
01:28:01,560 --> 01:28:05,840
the leaf nitrogen percentage across

2048
01:28:04,279 --> 01:28:07,800
three different cultivars and we

2049
01:28:05,840 --> 01:28:10,039
observed the similar Trend that higher

2050
01:28:07,800 --> 01:28:12,760
nitrogen rates were having higher Leaf

2051
01:28:10,039 --> 01:28:14,439
nitrogen percentage and the overall Leaf

2052
01:28:12,760 --> 01:28:16,920
nitrogen percentage decreased with the

2053
01:28:14,439 --> 01:28:16,919
growth of

2054
01:28:17,760 --> 01:28:22,960
plants we we collected nine different

2055
01:28:20,840 --> 01:28:24,639
hyperspectral images at different growth

2056
01:28:22,960 --> 01:28:27,118
stages of kidney beans

2057
01:28:24,639 --> 01:28:28,960
and we observed that in the beginning of

2058
01:28:27,118 --> 01:28:31,319
the season and at the very end of the

2059
01:28:28,960 --> 01:28:32,920
season when the crop is completely dry

2060
01:28:31,319 --> 01:28:35,039
the spectral signature or the

2061
01:28:32,920 --> 01:28:38,000
reflectance values in the near infrared

2062
01:28:35,039 --> 01:28:39,319
region were not that high however in the

2063
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:41,198
middle of the Season there was

2064
01:28:39,319 --> 01:28:44,399
substantial increase in the reflectance

2065
01:28:41,198 --> 01:28:46,839
values in the red Edge region also

2066
01:28:44,399 --> 01:28:49,319
similar to snap beans different nitrogen

2067
01:28:46,840 --> 01:28:51,440
treatments were having specific spectral

2068
01:28:49,319 --> 01:28:53,439
signature and that was more evident in

2069
01:28:51,439 --> 01:28:56,118
the middle of the Season we didn't

2070
01:28:53,439 --> 01:28:59,000
really observe any specific pattern of

2071
01:28:56,118 --> 01:29:01,799
the top 20 wavelengths as we observed in

2072
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:03,560
snap beans but we did observe that at

2073
01:29:01,800 --> 01:29:05,920
certain growth stages they were more

2074
01:29:03,560 --> 01:29:08,560
scattered and at certain growth stages

2075
01:29:05,920 --> 01:29:08,560
they were more

2076
01:29:09,399 --> 01:29:13,399
clustered for kidney bean eeld

2077
01:29:11,679 --> 01:29:15,920
prediction linear regression model

2078
01:29:13,399 --> 01:29:18,920
performed better as compared to other

2079
01:29:15,920 --> 01:29:21,279
models and it performed best when it was

2080
01:29:18,920 --> 01:29:23,600
trained using top 20 wavelengths along

2081
01:29:21,279 --> 01:29:26,039
with genetic environment and management

2082
01:29:23,600 --> 01:29:27,960
factors together but overall our

2083
01:29:26,039 --> 01:29:31,719
prediction for crop yield of kidney

2084
01:29:27,960 --> 01:29:34,319
beans was not as good as kidney snap

2085
01:29:31,719 --> 01:29:36,600
beans these two dates were used for

2086
01:29:34,319 --> 01:29:38,759
inseason leaf uh inseason nitrogen

2087
01:29:36,600 --> 01:29:42,000
prediction of kidney beans and we

2088
01:29:38,760 --> 01:29:43,520
observed that the the top 20 wavelengths

2089
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:45,560
highly correlating with the leaf

2090
01:29:43,520 --> 01:29:47,600
nitrogen percentage were in the visible

2091
01:29:45,560 --> 01:29:50,800
part of the Spectra and they were more

2092
01:29:47,600 --> 01:29:52,400
clustered and at 50 days after planting

2093
01:29:50,800 --> 01:29:55,400
the top 20 wavelengths were more

2094
01:29:52,399 --> 01:29:55,399
scattered

2095
01:29:56,479 --> 01:30:00,919
and random forest model performed better

2096
01:29:58,639 --> 01:30:03,239
at predicting inseason Leaf nitrogen

2097
01:30:00,920 --> 01:30:04,920
percentage of kidney beans when we

2098
01:30:03,238 --> 01:30:06,519
trained the model using top 20

2099
01:30:04,920 --> 01:30:08,800
wavelength along with genetic

2100
01:30:06,520 --> 01:30:12,000
environment and management factors

2101
01:30:08,800 --> 01:30:14,239
together in conclusion we observed that

2102
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:16,319
higher nitrogen treatments lead to

2103
01:30:14,238 --> 01:30:18,839
higher crop yield and leaf nitrogen

2104
01:30:16,319 --> 01:30:21,158
percentage but the response is very much

2105
01:30:18,840 --> 01:30:23,679
variety dependent and the spectral

2106
01:30:21,158 --> 01:30:26,079
signature change across different growth

2107
01:30:23,679 --> 01:30:28,679
States and different nitrogen treatments

2108
01:30:26,079 --> 01:30:31,479
have specific spectral signature the top

2109
01:30:28,679 --> 01:30:33,960
20 wavelengths also change across

2110
01:30:31,479 --> 01:30:36,839
different growth stages meaning that we

2111
01:30:33,960 --> 01:30:39,279
might need different uh parts of the

2112
01:30:36,840 --> 01:30:41,000
Spectra for predicting crop heeld or

2113
01:30:39,279 --> 01:30:42,599
inseason nitrogen percentage at

2114
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:45,000
different growth growth

2115
01:30:42,600 --> 01:30:47,480
stages we could use machine learning

2116
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:51,000
models for kidney bean and snap Bean

2117
01:30:47,479 --> 01:30:55,359
eeld prediction but we need both G

2118
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:57,520
factors along with plant Spectra

2119
01:30:55,359 --> 01:31:00,519
the future work will focus on validating

2120
01:30:57,520 --> 01:31:02,239
our models in commercial field settings

2121
01:31:00,520 --> 01:31:05,119
across different environmental

2122
01:31:02,238 --> 01:31:07,759
conditions soil types and on different

2123
01:31:05,118 --> 01:31:10,118
vegetable crops and the long-term go

2124
01:31:07,760 --> 01:31:12,520
goal of this project is to develop whole

2125
01:31:10,118 --> 01:31:16,118
field maps that will help vegetable

2126
01:31:12,520 --> 01:31:18,920
Growers optimize the inseason fertilizer

2127
01:31:16,118 --> 01:31:20,920
management um by keeping in mind a

2128
01:31:18,920 --> 01:31:23,560
certain yield

2129
01:31:20,920 --> 01:31:24,480
goal I would like to thank all the lab

01:31:57,800 --> 01:32:02,760
AAL what what is what's the source of

2143
01:32:07,238 --> 01:32:13,519
that sure so the question is that the

2144
01:32:11,198 --> 01:32:15,919
reflection at 2 micrometer like what is

2145
01:32:13,520 --> 01:32:17,760
leading to that reflection so maybe I

2146
01:32:15,920 --> 01:32:21,719
could go back quickly to

2147
01:32:17,760 --> 01:32:23,920
the um like the the slides here but

2148
01:32:21,719 --> 01:32:25,840
usually in the visible part of the

2149
01:32:23,920 --> 01:32:28,158
Spectra the reflectance is due to

2150
01:32:25,840 --> 01:32:30,199
chlorophyll absorption or absorption of

2151
01:32:28,158 --> 01:32:32,158
different pigments but in the near

2152
01:32:30,198 --> 01:32:35,079
infrared region the reflectance is due

2153
01:32:32,158 --> 01:32:37,319
to plant structure or canopy structure

2154
01:32:35,079 --> 01:32:39,920
or cell structure and in the shortwave

2155
01:32:37,319 --> 01:32:42,359
infrared region the reflectance is due

2156
01:32:39,920 --> 01:32:45,039
to uh the water content of the plants or

2157
01:32:42,359 --> 01:32:45,039
dry metal

2158
01:32:46,158 --> 01:32:50,279
accumulation does that answer your

2159
01:32:51,479 --> 01:32:56,599
question so the question is that that

2160
01:32:54,600 --> 01:32:58,880
what is our hypothesis that early point

2161
01:32:56,600 --> 01:33:03,199
is more predictive for crop yield

2162
01:32:58,880 --> 01:33:06,199
production so um we observed that like

2163
01:33:03,198 --> 01:33:08,000
the the rcare for Crop eeld Production

2164
01:33:06,198 --> 01:33:10,000
was really good in the beginning of the

2165
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:12,600
season and it could help like for

2166
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:14,118
example at 25 days after planting we

2167
01:33:12,600 --> 01:33:16,520
haven't applied our second nitrogen

2168
01:33:14,118 --> 01:33:18,519
treatment yet and if we could we would

2169
01:33:16,520 --> 01:33:22,560
know that how much crop yeld we would

2170
01:33:18,520 --> 01:33:25,080
get and if we would be able to um find

2171
01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:26,679
that how much nitrogen crop needs or how

2172
01:33:25,079 --> 01:33:28,840
much nitrogen is there in the plants

2173
01:33:26,679 --> 01:33:31,960
right now it could help in determining

2174
01:33:28,840 --> 01:33:34,840
the fertilizer um management or like

2175
01:33:31,960 --> 01:33:34,840
making the management

2176
01:33:39,118 --> 01:33:43,880
decisions so uh for SN kidney beans we

2177
01:33:42,359 --> 01:33:45,719
didn't really get like really good

2178
01:33:43,880 --> 01:33:48,840
prediction early in the season but for

2179
01:33:45,719 --> 01:33:51,840
snap beans we we did get really good

2180
01:33:48,840 --> 01:33:54,000
prediction um at early growth stages and

2181
01:33:51,840 --> 01:33:56,039
the reason behind that could be that

2182
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:58,439
like and that the top 20 wavelengths

2183
01:33:56,039 --> 01:34:01,079
were in the short wave infrared region

2184
01:33:58,439 --> 01:34:03,559
and that is uh that is the region where

2185
01:34:01,079 --> 01:34:06,238
most of the nitrogen absorption bands

2186
01:34:03,560 --> 01:34:09,520
are so and we had already applied the

2187
01:34:06,238 --> 01:34:11,759
first nitrogen treatment by that time so

2188
01:34:09,520 --> 01:34:13,480
that that that might be reflecting due

2189
01:34:11,760 --> 01:34:15,679
to the nitrogen first nitrogen treatment

2190
01:34:13,479 --> 01:34:17,839
application that we are seeing

2191
01:34:15,679 --> 01:34:21,600
differences in the plants and we are

2192
01:34:17,840 --> 01:34:25,719
able to uh see like what the crop e

2193
01:34:21,600 --> 01:34:25,719
would be early in the season

2194
01:34:28,198 --> 01:34:34,439
yes we did we um we saw white mold on

2195
01:34:31,520 --> 01:34:36,080
kidney beans but not on snap beans

2196
01:34:34,439 --> 01:34:38,839
because that that was a very short

2197
01:34:36,079 --> 01:34:40,238
duration crop and higher nitrogen

2198
01:34:38,840 --> 01:34:42,000
treatments were having like although I

2199
01:34:40,238 --> 01:34:43,678
haven't included the data here but

2200
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:47,238
higher nitrogen treatments were having

2201
01:34:43,679 --> 01:34:51,440
significantly higher white mold um

2202
01:34:47,238 --> 01:34:51,439
especially later like closer to the

2203
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:56,880
harvesting yes there was

2204
01:34:54,158 --> 01:34:59,000
like although the from our results

2205
01:34:56,880 --> 01:35:02,079
higher nitrogen treatments we're having

2206
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:03,679
higher crop yield but that white mold

2207
01:35:02,079 --> 01:35:06,359
could be a confounding Factor but we

2208
01:35:03,679 --> 01:35:07,600
don't really know that how to take that

2209
01:35:06,359 --> 01:35:10,599
out

2210
01:35:07,600 --> 01:35:10,600
for

2211
01:35:12,319 --> 01:35:17,000
measuring any other question

2212
01:35:17,960 --> 01:35:22,560
yes yes we we actually trying different

2213
01:35:20,439 --> 01:35:25,039
techniques like we also trying five

2214
01:35:22,560 --> 01:35:28,560
bands or the whole Spectra or just one

2215
01:35:25,039 --> 01:35:33,079
band and we are also trying uh PCA to

2216
01:35:28,560 --> 01:35:35,679
see like which bands but um like we were

2217
01:35:33,079 --> 01:35:37,920
we were like when we were choosing five

2218
01:35:35,679 --> 01:35:39,760
bands or 20 bands we were not getting

2219
01:35:37,920 --> 01:35:42,560
too much different results so we are

2220
01:35:39,760 --> 01:35:45,000
working on that to reduce the number of

2221
01:35:42,560 --> 01:35:46,719
bands so we could use uh take more

2222
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:49,158
advantage of hyperspectral imagery and

2223
01:35:46,719 --> 01:35:51,600
we could use this data for maybe

2224
01:35:49,158 --> 01:35:54,519
designing a multispectral sensor that or

2225
01:35:51,600 --> 01:35:56,639
like deciding that which region or which

2226
01:35:54,520 --> 01:35:59,520
wavelengths are most important at

2227
01:35:56,639 --> 01:36:02,520
different at a certain growth

2228
01:35:59,520 --> 01:36:02,520
stage

2229
01:36:03,840 --> 01:36:10,480
yes yeah we do like the spectral

2230
01:36:07,880 --> 01:36:13,600
signature is changing actually due to

2231
01:36:10,479 --> 01:36:16,839
like that that uh due to the changes in

2232
01:36:13,600 --> 01:36:18,760
the metabolites in the plants and for

2233
01:36:16,840 --> 01:36:21,039
example later in the season for kidney

2234
01:36:18,760 --> 01:36:23,639
bean spectral signature the plants are

2235
01:36:21,039 --> 01:36:26,519
dying and that's why we are seeing

2236
01:36:23,639 --> 01:36:29,359
slightly higher reflectance values in

2237
01:36:26,520 --> 01:36:31,560
the red region which is due to which

2238
01:36:29,359 --> 01:36:33,839
might be due to K kides but we haven't

2239
01:36:31,560 --> 01:36:37,039
done really done any kind of chemical

2240
01:36:33,840 --> 01:36:39,119
analysis yet to see where the absorption

2241
01:36:37,039 --> 01:36:41,840
bands are or like what is exactly

2242
01:36:39,118 --> 01:36:41,839
leading to the

2243
01:36:43,039 --> 01:36:47,039
change actually when I started the

2244
01:36:45,118 --> 01:36:48,759
project we I started with calculating

2245
01:36:47,039 --> 01:36:51,000
different vegetation indices and we

2246
01:36:48,760 --> 01:36:53,639
calculated 26 different vegetation

2247
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:56,359
indices but we were not seeing

2248
01:36:53,639 --> 01:36:59,118
particular trend for example um they

2249
01:36:56,359 --> 01:37:01,279
were like at certain growth stages one

2250
01:36:59,118 --> 01:37:03,639
vegetation index was doing really well

2251
01:37:01,279 --> 01:37:05,679
but at certain growth stage there was

2252
01:37:03,639 --> 01:37:06,920
another vegetation index who which was

2253
01:37:05,679 --> 01:37:09,600
doing well we were not able to

2254
01:37:06,920 --> 01:37:12,279
generalize and then we were having so

2255
01:37:09,600 --> 01:37:15,280
many wavelengths and we thought why not

2256
01:37:12,279 --> 01:37:17,599
like play around with data and see what

2257
01:37:15,279 --> 01:37:21,039
what what the like better information we

2258
01:37:17,600 --> 01:37:25,320
could get out of it and decide that what

2259
01:37:21,039 --> 01:37:25,319
wavelengths will be more helpful

2260
01:37:25,960 --> 01:37:31,079
so uh that's a really good question that

2261
01:37:28,118 --> 01:37:33,519
is the irrigated sandy soil is uh in

2262
01:37:31,079 --> 01:37:36,118
central region of Wisconsin where most

2263
01:37:33,520 --> 01:37:37,920
of the snap Bean Growers are and they

2264
01:37:36,118 --> 01:37:41,439
grow beans or even the kidney bean

2265
01:37:37,920 --> 01:37:44,760
Growers are and we like there is a huge

2266
01:37:41,439 --> 01:37:46,399
nitrate leeching problem there and uh

2267
01:37:44,760 --> 01:37:48,920
the another objective of this project

2268
01:37:46,399 --> 01:37:51,799
was also to optimize or to like find

2269
01:37:48,920 --> 01:37:54,719
which nitrogen treatment could be best

2270
01:37:51,800 --> 01:37:57,039
for getting higher crop e as well as it

2271
01:37:54,719 --> 01:37:59,719
is best for from environmental point of

2272
01:37:57,039 --> 01:38:01,679
view so that was the reason we decided

2273
01:37:59,719 --> 01:38:03,279
to choose that region but in Wisconson

2274
01:38:01,679 --> 01:38:06,239
there are another soil types as well in

2275
01:38:03,279 --> 01:38:09,479
northern region it's not completely

2276
01:38:06,238 --> 01:38:10,799
sandy soil it's more of a clay soil or

2277
01:38:09,479 --> 01:38:14,198
silty LOM

2278
01:38:10,800 --> 01:38:16,560
soil well it is my honor to introduce Dr

2279
01:38:14,198 --> 01:38:18,839
Nolan Bowski Nolan is a research

2280
01:38:16,560 --> 01:38:21,239
scientist at the mushroom spawn company

2281
01:38:18,840 --> 01:38:22,679
Amel spawn mate where he focuses on

2282
01:38:21,238 --> 01:38:25,000
improving the white button mushroom

2283
01:38:22,679 --> 01:38:26,960
through genomics and bioinformatic

2284
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:28,599
approaches uh before working as a

2285
01:38:26,960 --> 01:38:31,319
mushroom breeder he got his mattress

2286
01:38:28,599 --> 01:38:33,239
from Michigan State in the dry be

2287
01:38:31,319 --> 01:38:36,198
breeding and genetics program and then

2288
01:38:33,238 --> 01:38:39,000
obtained his PhD from MSU under the GU

2289
01:38:36,198 --> 01:38:40,879
guidance of Dr Robin be uh today he will

2290
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:42,719
print present some of highlights in

2291
01:38:40,880 --> 01:38:45,239
mushroom breeding with his talk titled

2292
01:38:42,719 --> 01:38:47,198
out of the dark historical challenges

2293
01:38:45,238 --> 01:38:50,238
and modern solutions in button mushroom

2294
01:38:47,198 --> 01:38:54,319
breeding please welcome Nolan to the

2295
01:38:50,238 --> 01:38:58,598
stage okay great um thanks everyone for

2296
01:38:54,319 --> 01:39:00,880
coming out um had some great talks um so

2297
01:38:58,599 --> 01:39:04,520
yeah today I'm going to be talking about

2298
01:39:00,880 --> 01:39:08,359
a very unusual crop um from a plant

2299
01:39:04,520 --> 01:39:11,679
perspective um we grow button mushrooms

2300
01:39:08,359 --> 01:39:14,198
um at our company here and it certainly

2301
01:39:11,679 --> 01:39:15,960
has a lot of complex uh challenges

2302
01:39:14,198 --> 01:39:18,118
associated with this

2303
01:39:15,960 --> 01:39:20,000
crop um so here's a little bit of an

2304
01:39:18,118 --> 01:39:22,759
outline I'm going to start with an

2305
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:25,399
introduction um to introduce you to

2306
01:39:22,760 --> 01:39:28,039
myself my company and a little bit about

2307
01:39:25,399 --> 01:39:29,759
the system that we work with um then I'm

2308
01:39:28,039 --> 01:39:32,319
going to dive into some of our breeding

2309
01:39:29,760 --> 01:39:34,800
challenges and how we kind of approach

2310
01:39:32,319 --> 01:39:37,000
them finally I'm going to conclude with

2311
01:39:34,800 --> 01:39:41,119
some of our research highlights and a

2312
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:41,118
future outlook on the industry and our

2313
01:39:41,238 --> 01:39:47,039
company um so a little bit about me um I

2314
01:39:44,679 --> 01:39:49,079
like to describe myself as a scientist

2315
01:39:47,039 --> 01:39:51,960
uh who works with DNA sequence to make

2316
01:39:49,079 --> 01:39:55,639
better plants and for the past few years

2317
01:39:51,960 --> 01:39:58,679
uh I can also include fun in that um

2318
01:39:55,639 --> 01:40:01,719
this uh crazy mushroom uh looking guy

2319
01:39:58,679 --> 01:40:04,679
was actually me uh from a few years

2320
01:40:01,719 --> 01:40:07,639
ago I I'm still the crazy mushroom guy

2321
01:40:04,679 --> 01:40:11,079
it's just harder to tell

2322
01:40:07,639 --> 01:40:13,319
now um so anyway I I have a background

2323
01:40:11,079 --> 01:40:15,920
in plant breeding um I've worked with

2324
01:40:13,319 --> 01:40:18,279
different plant species I worked at

2325
01:40:15,920 --> 01:40:21,679
potatoes at as an undergraduate

2326
01:40:18,279 --> 01:40:24,000
researcher and then uh for my graduate

2327
01:40:21,679 --> 01:40:26,480
degrees I worked in Tradition breeding

2328
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:29,319
with the dry bean breeding program and

2329
01:40:26,479 --> 01:40:32,198
then I pursued my PhD in more of like a

2330
01:40:29,319 --> 01:40:35,079
computational and genomics area where I

2331
01:40:32,198 --> 01:40:38,439
worked in maze um and also some orphan

2332
01:40:35,079 --> 01:40:40,960
crops as well I had a stint as a in the

2333
01:40:38,439 --> 01:40:43,319
popcorn breeding uh sector which was

2334
01:40:40,960 --> 01:40:46,840
also very fun uh we get a lot of free

2335
01:40:43,319 --> 01:40:49,359
popcorn samples there and uh currently

2336
01:40:46,840 --> 01:40:52,079
I'm a research scientists um where I use

2337
01:40:49,359 --> 01:40:54,598
genomics and bioinformatics to help make

2338
01:40:52,079 --> 01:40:57,279
better mushrooms at the spawn company

2339
01:40:54,599 --> 01:41:01,279
MSL spawn

2340
01:40:57,279 --> 01:41:04,279
M so you may be wondering who is MSL

2341
01:41:01,279 --> 01:41:07,118
spawn mate well we're kind of a big deal

2342
01:41:04,279 --> 01:41:08,960
in the mushroom industry and it's okay

2343
01:41:07,118 --> 01:41:11,198
if you haven't heard of us um we're

2344
01:41:08,960 --> 01:41:15,480
actually one of the three major uh spawn

2345
01:41:11,198 --> 01:41:18,000
producers in the United States and so

2346
01:41:15,479 --> 01:41:20,799
how the system works is spawn is what we

2347
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:23,439
use as seeds to plant our crop to grow

2348
01:41:20,800 --> 01:41:25,840
mushrooms and the spawn is just actually

2349
01:41:23,439 --> 01:41:29,359
grain that's colonized by

2350
01:41:25,840 --> 01:41:32,560
Mycelia so our two main goals are to

2351
01:41:29,359 --> 01:41:34,639
develop new mushroom strains and we also

2352
01:41:32,560 --> 01:41:37,800
make spawn for our mushroom

2353
01:41:34,639 --> 01:41:40,719
Growers our company is vertically

2354
01:41:37,800 --> 01:41:43,520
integrated this means that we can grow

2355
01:41:40,719 --> 01:41:46,279
mushrooms on our own farms and we have

2356
01:41:43,520 --> 01:41:48,840
Farms across the United States Mexico

2357
01:41:46,279 --> 01:41:51,559
and France so we can bring our consumers

2358
01:41:48,840 --> 01:41:53,400
very fresh product we can move these

2359
01:41:51,560 --> 01:41:56,480
mushrooms around using a trans

2360
01:41:53,399 --> 01:41:58,839
transportation company that we are also

2361
01:41:56,479 --> 01:42:00,879
associated with and then we sell our

2362
01:41:58,840 --> 01:42:03,159
mushrooms under the Monteray mushrooms

2363
01:42:00,880 --> 01:42:04,880
label if you ever see this in in the

2364
01:42:03,158 --> 01:42:07,598
grocery

2365
01:42:04,880 --> 01:42:09,440
stores and our main focus and what I'm

2366
01:42:07,599 --> 01:42:12,800
going to spend most of the talk today on

2367
01:42:09,439 --> 01:42:16,598
is a garus bisporus or the button

2368
01:42:12,800 --> 01:42:20,159
mushroom um for reference we have about

2369
01:42:16,599 --> 01:42:22,119
75% of the brown mushroom market share

2370
01:42:20,158 --> 01:42:23,920
um and the brown mushrooms in this

2371
01:42:22,118 --> 01:42:25,319
context are the same as the white

2372
01:42:23,920 --> 01:42:28,158
mushrooms they're all from the same

2373
01:42:25,319 --> 01:42:30,759
species um agaricus bores just with a

2374
01:42:28,158 --> 01:42:30,759
different cap

2375
01:42:31,079 --> 01:42:38,599
color um so like I said we're one of the

2376
01:42:34,840 --> 01:42:42,400
major spawn producers in the US um our

2377
01:42:38,599 --> 01:42:45,319
our office is located in a a very modest

2378
01:42:42,399 --> 01:42:48,319
uh building in Central Coast of

2379
01:42:45,319 --> 01:42:51,279
California and in addition to those

2380
01:42:48,319 --> 01:42:54,039
major uh goals there we also serve as a

2381
01:42:51,279 --> 01:42:56,880
research engine so there's lot of

2382
01:42:54,039 --> 01:42:59,599
unresolved know science and questions in

2383
01:42:56,880 --> 01:43:04,000
the mushroom breeding realm and we have

2384
01:42:59,599 --> 01:43:07,199
a small group but we also spend a part

2385
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:09,158
of our resources to develop and develop

2386
01:43:07,198 --> 01:43:11,319
resources to try to better understand

2387
01:43:09,158 --> 01:43:12,799
what are we actually doing and how does

2388
01:43:11,319 --> 01:43:16,198
our crop

2389
01:43:12,800 --> 01:43:18,840
work um so it's a very small group um we

2390
01:43:16,198 --> 01:43:22,000
have a director we have about five

2391
01:43:18,840 --> 01:43:23,679
research scientists on staff um we have

2392
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:26,520
lab assistants to help help with the wet

2393
01:43:23,679 --> 01:43:28,199
lab things support staff and some

2394
01:43:26,520 --> 01:43:30,880
growing technicians who actually are in

2395
01:43:28,198 --> 01:43:32,559
charge of spawning or seating the rooms

2396
01:43:30,880 --> 01:43:34,359
and creating our trials and then

2397
01:43:32,560 --> 01:43:36,960
harvesting the

2398
01:43:34,359 --> 01:43:40,238
mushrooms we also provide other services

2399
01:43:36,960 --> 01:43:42,359
to our country or to our company um we

2400
01:43:40,238 --> 01:43:44,959
certify our strains before we release

2401
01:43:42,359 --> 01:43:47,279
them commercially we test and analyze

2402
01:43:44,960 --> 01:43:49,239
mushroom substrates and this is

2403
01:43:47,279 --> 01:43:52,599
important this would be analogous to

2404
01:43:49,238 --> 01:43:56,079
doing soil testing services um to bring

2405
01:43:52,599 --> 01:43:58,920
it into plant realm um we develop new

2406
01:43:56,079 --> 01:44:01,599
products and we also provide strain ID

2407
01:43:58,920 --> 01:44:03,719
and disease testing for some of our our

2408
01:44:01,599 --> 01:44:05,719
companies that we sell our spawn to we

2409
01:44:03,719 --> 01:44:09,760
sell the

2410
01:44:05,719 --> 01:44:11,198
seed um so the button mushroom we've

2411
01:44:09,760 --> 01:44:15,000
kind of already established it's a

2412
01:44:11,198 --> 01:44:17,359
pretty Niche crop um it's a hybrid crop

2413
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:19,679
that's colly propagated and it's

2414
01:44:17,359 --> 01:44:22,799
perishable but it has high value and

2415
01:44:19,679 --> 01:44:26,319
requires high input so just looking at

2416
01:44:22,800 --> 01:44:28,199
that I think the closest plant system

2417
01:44:26,319 --> 01:44:31,079
that I can think of it's pretty similar

2418
01:44:28,198 --> 01:44:33,319
to strawberries uh in this regard but

2419
01:44:31,079 --> 01:44:36,118
certainly other barries um could be

2420
01:44:33,319 --> 01:44:39,399
considered as being similar

2421
01:44:36,118 --> 01:44:43,319
too um I pulled some data from the

2422
01:44:39,399 --> 01:44:46,719
20123 uh us uh economics to look at the

2423
01:44:43,319 --> 01:44:50,639
crop values and I have them sorted

2424
01:44:46,719 --> 01:44:53,198
according to this uh leftmost y AIS so

2425
01:44:50,639 --> 01:44:55,079
the data will be highlighted in blue is

2426
01:44:53,198 --> 01:44:58,158
the total production value in billions

2427
01:44:55,079 --> 01:45:00,519
of dollars and obviously corn is King

2428
01:44:58,158 --> 01:45:02,719
here no surprise there and you know

2429
01:45:00,520 --> 01:45:07,080
soybeans are also take take up a lot of

2430
01:45:02,719 --> 01:45:09,639
the the market um mushrooms are down

2431
01:45:07,079 --> 01:45:12,039
over here um they're they have a very

2432
01:45:09,639 --> 01:45:14,880
small total value in terms of the

2433
01:45:12,039 --> 01:45:18,000
economic output in the US however I

2434
01:45:14,880 --> 01:45:20,880
would like to highlight the um right

2435
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:22,639
side Y axis which is the price per pound

2436
01:45:20,880 --> 01:45:23,679
so you can see that they have very high

2437
01:45:22,639 --> 01:45:26,359
value

2438
01:45:23,679 --> 01:45:28,719
um in this regard also similar to

2439
01:45:26,359 --> 01:45:31,479
strawberries and some other you could

2440
01:45:28,719 --> 01:45:34,039
say more minor

2441
01:45:31,479 --> 01:45:36,359
crops um I'm going to focus and

2442
01:45:34,039 --> 01:45:39,880
highlight this this little modest uh

2443
01:45:36,359 --> 01:45:42,880
segment here we have about uh a billion

2444
01:45:39,880 --> 01:45:45,719
dollars of total value uh in

2445
01:45:42,880 --> 01:45:48,800
2023 and this pie chart is breaking it

2446
01:45:45,719 --> 01:45:50,719
down by the different sectors and the

2447
01:45:48,800 --> 01:45:53,960
blue is what I'd like to highlight most

2448
01:45:50,719 --> 01:45:56,198
of our mushrooms go towards Fresh Market

2449
01:45:53,960 --> 01:45:58,039
however we do have mushroom segments

2450
01:45:56,198 --> 01:46:01,399
that are used for processing like would

2451
01:45:58,039 --> 01:46:03,118
go in like a processed soup for example

2452
01:46:01,399 --> 01:46:05,279
and there's also a segment for specialty

2453
01:46:03,118 --> 01:46:07,479
mushrooms these would be other mushrooms

2454
01:46:05,279 --> 01:46:10,920
like you may have heard of like shitake

2455
01:46:07,479 --> 01:46:13,879
or oyster or turkey tail things like

2456
01:46:10,920 --> 01:46:16,960
that however most of our Revenue stream

2457
01:46:13,880 --> 01:46:19,440
comes from um reading a garus by spores

2458
01:46:16,960 --> 01:46:22,399
for Fresh

2459
01:46:19,439 --> 01:46:25,479
Market so I need to introduce a little

2460
01:46:22,399 --> 01:46:28,279
bit about button mushroom biology um

2461
01:46:25,479 --> 01:46:31,359
they belong to some fungi called the

2462
01:46:28,279 --> 01:46:33,479
bidio mys and they're called Club funi

2463
01:46:31,359 --> 01:46:34,960
because of the shape of their spores

2464
01:46:33,479 --> 01:46:37,718
they kind of look like a

2465
01:46:34,960 --> 01:46:40,560
club um the white mushrooms and the

2466
01:46:37,719 --> 01:46:43,760
brown mushrooms are all part of this

2467
01:46:40,560 --> 01:46:46,119
club if you will um so the only

2468
01:46:43,760 --> 01:46:49,199
difference is they have different uh cap

2469
01:46:46,118 --> 01:46:51,198
colors furthermore the differences

2470
01:46:49,198 --> 01:46:53,638
between what you might see in the store

2471
01:46:51,198 --> 01:46:56,960
Market as perini mushrooms or baby

2472
01:46:53,639 --> 01:46:58,560
Bellas and Porta Bellas is just a

2473
01:46:56,960 --> 01:47:00,520
difference when they were harvested they

2474
01:46:58,560 --> 01:47:02,440
were harvested at different

2475
01:47:00,520 --> 01:47:04,159
maturities there are certain

2476
01:47:02,439 --> 01:47:06,960
considerations from a breeding

2477
01:47:04,158 --> 01:47:08,879
perspective if we want to breed for

2478
01:47:06,960 --> 01:47:11,599
crini mushrooms which are harvested

2479
01:47:08,880 --> 01:47:14,719
small versus portabellas which are

2480
01:47:11,599 --> 01:47:16,920
harvested later um considering the speed

2481
01:47:14,719 --> 01:47:18,560
that the that the Caps develop and the

2482
01:47:16,920 --> 01:47:22,399
and the gills open

2483
01:47:18,560 --> 01:47:24,480
up um so some other bidio seeds you may

2484
01:47:22,399 --> 01:47:27,519
have heard of include polypores these

2485
01:47:24,479 --> 01:47:30,118
are like the Shelf Bui that verant trees

2486
01:47:27,520 --> 01:47:32,800
an example of this here is turkey tail

2487
01:47:30,118 --> 01:47:35,839
beautiful um and from a a plant

2488
01:47:32,800 --> 01:47:38,400
scientist perspective I had grown so

2489
01:47:35,840 --> 01:47:40,880
accustomed to thinking of fun fungi as

2490
01:47:38,399 --> 01:47:43,359
the enemy because we typically see them

2491
01:47:40,880 --> 01:47:46,279
you know in this kind of pathogenic

2492
01:47:43,359 --> 01:47:49,639
World um so some example of other absity

2493
01:47:46,279 --> 01:47:52,479
mys include rusts and

2494
01:47:49,639 --> 01:47:55,239
smuts as far as when I say the term

2495
01:47:52,479 --> 01:47:57,519
mushroom let's just get on the same page

2496
01:47:55,238 --> 01:48:02,238
um the mushroom is just the fleshy Spore

2497
01:47:57,520 --> 01:48:04,960
bearing Fring body and to make an

2498
01:48:02,238 --> 01:48:07,000
analogous to plants we have our Melia

2499
01:48:04,960 --> 01:48:09,960
down here which would forage for

2500
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:13,359
nutrients like the roots the stem which

2501
01:48:09,960 --> 01:48:15,679
provides support to the structure and

2502
01:48:13,359 --> 01:48:17,839
then the marketable portion up here is

2503
01:48:15,679 --> 01:48:20,679
the C and this would be the fruit or the

2504
01:48:17,840 --> 01:48:20,679
part of the plant that

2505
01:48:21,158 --> 01:48:26,079
sold um now I'm going to introduce a few

2506
01:48:24,279 --> 01:48:30,000
Concepts that will be most likely

2507
01:48:26,079 --> 01:48:32,840
foreign uh so they all come from Greek U

2508
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:36,439
which is uh really fun if you're a fan

2509
01:48:32,840 --> 01:48:38,800
of My Big Fat Greek Wedding um but these

2510
01:48:36,439 --> 01:48:40,399
terms are Homo carens versus

2511
01:48:38,800 --> 01:48:44,800
heterocaryons

2512
01:48:40,399 --> 01:48:47,679
so in this fungus we have homo carens

2513
01:48:44,800 --> 01:48:50,079
that are either spores or mycelium that

2514
01:48:47,679 --> 01:48:51,319
have an identical nuclei type these

2515
01:48:50,079 --> 01:48:54,800
would be our

2516
01:48:51,319 --> 01:48:58,118
haids we also have heterocaryons and

2517
01:48:54,800 --> 01:49:00,440
this refers to spores or melium with two

2518
01:48:58,118 --> 01:49:04,000
different nuclei these are also called

2519
01:49:00,439 --> 01:49:05,879
diaran because they have one haploid set

2520
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:08,399
coexisting in the same cell with a

2521
01:49:05,880 --> 01:49:12,199
different hpid

2522
01:49:08,399 --> 01:49:14,238
set I found this life cycle uh figure

2523
01:49:12,198 --> 01:49:17,559
from a textbook and I think it's it

2524
01:49:14,238 --> 01:49:20,879
demonstrates a general bidy life cycle

2525
01:49:17,560 --> 01:49:22,880
there are some Works about our specific

2526
01:49:20,880 --> 01:49:25,639
mushroom that we're talking about here

2527
01:49:22,880 --> 01:49:28,440
um and I will make be sure to describe

2528
01:49:25,639 --> 01:49:32,800
them so let's start at the beginning as

2529
01:49:28,439 --> 01:49:35,158
they say um in step one here we see uh

2530
01:49:32,800 --> 01:49:38,119
we see Melia of two different mating

2531
01:49:35,158 --> 01:49:39,839
types colored as a blue mating type here

2532
01:49:38,118 --> 01:49:42,279
and a red mating type

2533
01:49:39,840 --> 01:49:45,000
here these mating types if they're

2534
01:49:42,279 --> 01:49:48,559
compatible will fuse together in step

2535
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:52,198
two here the step is called plasmogamy

2536
01:49:48,560 --> 01:49:53,400
and they will produce this diotic melum

2537
01:49:52,198 --> 01:49:55,919
so again

2538
01:49:53,399 --> 01:49:59,679
these two nuclear types are coexisting

2539
01:49:55,920 --> 01:50:03,199
in the same house or in the same

2540
01:49:59,679 --> 01:50:05,359
cell then step three step three occurs

2541
01:50:03,198 --> 01:50:07,678
when we provide the correct substrate

2542
01:50:05,359 --> 01:50:09,880
and the right environmental conditions

2543
01:50:07,679 --> 01:50:12,440
the mushroom might the Mycelia will grow

2544
01:50:09,880 --> 01:50:14,159
and produce a fruiting body this is also

2545
01:50:12,439 --> 01:50:17,598
called a bidio

2546
01:50:14,158 --> 01:50:20,559
carb inside of the gills of this pidio

2547
01:50:17,599 --> 01:50:23,079
carb we have our two nuclei still

2548
01:50:20,560 --> 01:50:25,199
coexisting they haven't uh you know

2549
01:50:23,079 --> 01:50:27,960
necessarily combined yet they're still

2550
01:50:25,198 --> 01:50:30,439
existing uh

2551
01:50:27,960 --> 01:50:32,960
separately the SE they're still existing

2552
01:50:30,439 --> 01:50:35,039
separately um inside the bidia so now

2553
01:50:32,960 --> 01:50:37,560
we're getting into start starting the

2554
01:50:35,039 --> 01:50:40,158
reproductive process creat starting to

2555
01:50:37,560 --> 01:50:43,079
create the spores

2556
01:50:40,158 --> 01:50:46,759
themselves in the bidia they undergo

2557
01:50:43,078 --> 01:50:49,679
kogam so the two nuclei finally merge

2558
01:50:46,760 --> 01:50:51,280
together and then in the same into one

2559
01:50:49,679 --> 01:50:55,078
cell and this is where we get the

2560
01:50:51,279 --> 01:50:58,519
diploid zygo portion of the life

2561
01:50:55,078 --> 01:51:01,439
cycle this under meiosis it's not a

2562
01:50:58,520 --> 01:51:03,000
typical meiosis um there's some quirks

2563
01:51:01,439 --> 01:51:07,118
about that which I'll talk about in

2564
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:11,039
future slides but as a general result we

2565
01:51:07,118 --> 01:51:12,198
we do expect to see or haid nuclei as

2566
01:51:11,039 --> 01:51:15,279
the result of

2567
01:51:12,198 --> 01:51:17,960
meiosis these occur in the bidum they're

2568
01:51:15,279 --> 01:51:20,039
not yet packaged into

2569
01:51:17,960 --> 01:51:23,359
spores this is where it gets a little

2570
01:51:20,039 --> 01:51:26,719
bit weird with our crop because in

2571
01:51:23,359 --> 01:51:29,639
bidio they have these four spores and

2572
01:51:26,719 --> 01:51:33,399
each Spore gets one haid

2573
01:51:29,639 --> 01:51:35,239
nucleus however in agaricus bisporus

2574
01:51:33,399 --> 01:51:38,118
there's typically only two spores

2575
01:51:35,238 --> 01:51:42,158
produced and each of these spores

2576
01:51:38,118 --> 01:51:45,920
contain the parental uh nuclei so

2577
01:51:42,158 --> 01:51:48,118
essentially it's repackaging its myotic

2578
01:51:45,920 --> 01:51:50,239
products into a Spore that can be used

2579
01:51:48,118 --> 01:51:53,519
to recreate

2580
01:51:50,238 --> 01:51:56,439
itself and this this is a challenge um

2581
01:51:53,520 --> 01:51:57,920
so finally in Step eight we get this

2582
01:51:56,439 --> 01:52:00,919
dispersal and

2583
01:51:57,920 --> 01:52:04,158
germination in the very rare case in our

2584
01:52:00,920 --> 01:52:07,560
crop we have bidos spores containing one

2585
01:52:04,158 --> 01:52:08,799
appid nucleus nuclei nucleus sorry um

2586
01:52:07,560 --> 01:52:11,880
and these would be considered these

2587
01:52:08,800 --> 01:52:14,279
homar will germinate to create haid

2588
01:52:11,880 --> 01:52:16,560
Mycelia this happens very rarely

2589
01:52:14,279 --> 01:52:19,840
unfortunately the more common case is

2590
01:52:16,560 --> 01:52:23,320
where we get diotic spores germinating

2591
01:52:19,840 --> 01:52:26,199
to produce diotic Mycelia that in turn

2592
01:52:23,319 --> 01:52:29,960
will create diotic mushrooms without

2593
01:52:26,198 --> 01:52:32,399
having any kind of uh introduction of

2594
01:52:29,960 --> 01:52:32,399
genetic

2595
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:38,679
diversity so the button mushroom

2596
01:52:36,118 --> 01:52:41,598
requires a nutrient they require certain

2597
01:52:38,679 --> 01:52:44,480
substrates to grow and in nature they

2598
01:52:41,599 --> 01:52:48,039
get these nutrients from manure or Leaf

2599
01:52:44,479 --> 01:52:50,399
litter shown here is an example of a

2600
01:52:48,039 --> 01:52:52,198
cypress tree and these are native to the

2601
01:52:50,399 --> 01:52:53,118
Central Coast of California where my

2602
01:52:52,198 --> 01:52:56,039
company

2603
01:52:53,118 --> 01:52:58,198
is located and button mushrooms are

2604
01:52:56,039 --> 01:53:01,479
found commonly associated in the litter

2605
01:52:58,198 --> 01:53:03,678
Leaf litter of these cypess

2606
01:53:01,479 --> 01:53:07,279
treats however from a production

2607
01:53:03,679 --> 01:53:09,679
standpoint we create our own substrates

2608
01:53:07,279 --> 01:53:12,078
in the case of Spawn this is the grain

2609
01:53:09,679 --> 01:53:16,239
that's colonized by our hybrid

2610
01:53:12,078 --> 01:53:19,238
Melia for agronomic trials we use small

2611
01:53:16,238 --> 01:53:22,078
amounts of Spawn we use we put the Grain

2612
01:53:19,238 --> 01:53:24,919
in flasks and inoculate the flasks with

2613
01:53:22,078 --> 01:53:27,679
little pie of Melia these Melia then

2614
01:53:24,920 --> 01:53:30,158
colonize the grain until you get this

2615
01:53:27,679 --> 01:53:31,279
mixture here which is ready to plant or

2616
01:53:30,158 --> 01:53:34,198
we call it

2617
01:53:31,279 --> 01:53:37,118
spawning in a commercial setting we use

2618
01:53:34,198 --> 01:53:40,638
these larger bags filled with grain

2619
01:53:37,118 --> 01:53:43,960
nutrients and Mycelia these bags have

2620
01:53:40,639 --> 01:53:46,840
strips that allow the exchange of uh

2621
01:53:43,960 --> 01:53:49,319
heat and gases and they're stored in

2622
01:53:46,840 --> 01:53:53,800
these climate controlled rooms so we can

2623
01:53:49,319 --> 01:53:57,118
better monitor their growth and progress

2624
01:53:53,800 --> 01:54:00,000
we also generate our own compost this is

2625
01:53:57,118 --> 01:54:01,598
done at a very large scale um you can

2626
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:05,679
see here this blue circle is

2627
01:54:01,599 --> 01:54:08,119
highlighting a person for for some scale

2628
01:54:05,679 --> 01:54:11,719
this compost is generated from mixing

2629
01:54:08,118 --> 01:54:13,960
wheat horse manure oil and some nitrogen

2630
01:54:11,719 --> 01:54:14,840
and we let it naturally break down for a

2631
01:54:13,960 --> 01:54:17,439
couple

2632
01:54:14,840 --> 01:54:19,880
weeks it also under goes a

2633
01:54:17,439 --> 01:54:23,000
pasteurization step after this which

2634
01:54:19,880 --> 01:54:25,078
breaks it down even further now this is

2635
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:28,399
helpful because this changes the

2636
01:54:25,078 --> 01:54:32,319
microbiome of the compost and in general

2637
01:54:28,399 --> 01:54:34,920
agaricus by sporis is pretty tolerant of

2638
01:54:32,319 --> 01:54:37,000
out competing any other kind of microbes

2639
01:54:34,920 --> 01:54:40,719
in the compost so it doesn't have to be

2640
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:40,719
like sterile sterile if you

2641
01:54:40,760 --> 01:54:45,880
will when we get to actually cultivating

2642
01:54:43,800 --> 01:54:47,920
the mushroom we plant them this is

2643
01:54:45,880 --> 01:54:49,359
called spawning where we mix our spawn

2644
01:54:47,920 --> 01:54:52,118
and our

2645
01:54:49,359 --> 01:54:54,559
compost the Mycelia will will colonize

2646
01:54:52,118 --> 01:54:58,198
this compost in all

2647
01:54:54,560 --> 01:55:00,280
directions and after about 2 weeks it's

2648
01:54:58,198 --> 01:55:03,919
been the compost has been colonized in

2649
01:55:00,279 --> 01:55:06,880
up and we add a casing layer this is

2650
01:55:03,920 --> 01:55:09,000
just a low nutrient layer that the myia

2651
01:55:06,880 --> 01:55:11,359
will grow into they will expand and it

2652
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:15,319
will force the Mycelia up into this

2653
01:55:11,359 --> 01:55:17,439
layer this also helps with watering so

2654
01:55:15,319 --> 01:55:20,319
just like any other crop we need to

2655
01:55:17,439 --> 01:55:22,519
water the mushrooms and making sure that

2656
01:55:20,319 --> 01:55:25,399
we have enough air space for the water

2657
01:55:22,520 --> 01:55:27,599
to actually get used up by the mushroom

2658
01:55:25,399 --> 01:55:27,598
is

2659
01:55:27,639 --> 01:55:34,319
important next part is we flush the room

2660
01:55:31,560 --> 01:55:36,520
and this is also referred to as a break

2661
01:55:34,319 --> 01:55:39,479
this is where we stimulate fruiting by

2662
01:55:36,520 --> 01:55:41,599
manipulating the environment so we

2663
01:55:39,479 --> 01:55:43,799
decrease the amount of carbon dioxide

2664
01:55:41,599 --> 01:55:46,360
that we pump into the rooms and we lower

2665
01:55:43,800 --> 01:55:49,199
the temperatures and this stimulates the

2666
01:55:46,359 --> 01:55:50,479
mushroom to say okay it's time to create

2667
01:55:49,198 --> 01:55:52,759
a a

2668
01:55:50,479 --> 01:55:56,399
mushroom typically we Harvest these

2669
01:55:52,760 --> 01:55:58,719
mushrooms over 5 days or so um then we

2670
01:55:56,399 --> 01:56:01,359
allow them about three or so days to

2671
01:55:58,719 --> 01:56:03,960
regrow and reform new

2672
01:56:01,359 --> 01:56:06,000
mushrooms in total we repeat this

2673
01:56:03,960 --> 01:56:08,760
process about two to three times so we

2674
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:11,319
have two to three breaks per planting

2675
01:56:08,760 --> 01:56:14,840
and each time we can say we get about

2676
01:56:11,319 --> 01:56:18,599
four to eight pounds per square foot per

2677
01:56:14,840 --> 01:56:20,800
flush obviously there's yield decreases

2678
01:56:18,599 --> 01:56:22,520
um with each flush that we get and this

2679
01:56:20,800 --> 01:56:25,639
is typical like you would see in like

2680
01:56:22,520 --> 01:56:28,920
other retun crops for example in our

2681
01:56:25,639 --> 01:56:31,400
case it's due to disease pressure mostly

2682
01:56:28,920 --> 01:56:34,039
um but also the nutrient availability

2683
01:56:31,399 --> 01:56:34,039
will decrease

2684
01:56:34,238 --> 01:56:39,319
slightly so here's an example of where

2685
01:56:37,078 --> 01:56:40,679
we grow the mushrooms contrary to

2686
01:56:39,319 --> 01:56:44,439
popular belief we don't have an

2687
01:56:40,679 --> 01:56:46,520
elaborate Cave System um we grow these

2688
01:56:44,439 --> 01:56:49,479
mushrooms in the case of for our

2689
01:56:46,520 --> 01:56:51,920
commercial tests in these uh walk-in

2690
01:56:49,479 --> 01:56:55,279
freezer type rooms that our climate

2691
01:56:51,920 --> 01:56:58,920
control control um and when we do these

2692
01:56:55,279 --> 01:57:01,759
tests we grow them in uh smaller wooden

2693
01:56:58,920 --> 01:57:04,960
boxes um that are filled with compost

2694
01:57:01,760 --> 01:57:08,039
and Mycelia and we frot them with

2695
01:57:04,960 --> 01:57:11,039
mushrooms and this is at this point I I

2696
01:57:08,039 --> 01:57:13,599
need to mention that this is a yearr

2697
01:57:11,039 --> 01:57:15,399
round Endeavor the growing the mushrooms

2698
01:57:13,599 --> 01:57:17,679
because we have them in a climate

2699
01:57:15,399 --> 01:57:19,960
controlled environment there's no

2700
01:57:17,679 --> 01:57:22,560
planting season or growing season

2701
01:57:19,960 --> 01:57:26,520
planting season is every day growing

2702
01:57:22,560 --> 01:57:28,960
season is every day um in fact we take

2703
01:57:26,520 --> 01:57:32,560
measurements on these mushrooms every

2704
01:57:28,960 --> 01:57:34,880
day because their growth is so fast um

2705
01:57:32,560 --> 01:57:37,119
so we're always collecting field data

2706
01:57:34,880 --> 01:57:40,239
every single day and using that to

2707
01:57:37,118 --> 01:57:42,880
quickly turn over and generate our our

2708
01:57:40,238 --> 01:57:46,158
blinds that we want to select um and

2709
01:57:42,880 --> 01:57:49,840
here I have a picture of uh our newest

2710
01:57:46,158 --> 01:57:52,238
member to the team um Chloe they were a

2711
01:57:49,840 --> 01:57:54,719
former Cornell Brad from the plant FAL

2712
01:57:52,238 --> 01:57:56,879
ology department so it's great to have

2713
01:57:54,719 --> 01:57:59,039
have them on board collecting this

2714
01:57:56,880 --> 01:58:02,440
important agronomic data for

2715
01:57:59,039 --> 01:58:04,719
us um on the right side here I'm showing

2716
01:58:02,439 --> 01:58:07,078
an example of the commercial production

2717
01:58:04,719 --> 01:58:09,319
rooms so this is done at a much larger

2718
01:58:07,078 --> 01:58:12,519
scale obviously than how we would test

2719
01:58:09,319 --> 01:58:15,679
or trial our new strains um and you see

2720
01:58:12,520 --> 01:58:18,400
these These are also uh very large

2721
01:58:15,679 --> 01:58:21,000
wooden beds or trays that are filled

2722
01:58:18,399 --> 01:58:24,198
with composts and spawn and mushrooms

2723
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:28,599
are grown and manually harvested um so

2724
01:58:24,198 --> 01:58:28,598
this requires quite a large amount of

2725
01:58:29,118 --> 01:58:34,198
labor now kind of giving you the broad

2726
01:58:31,960 --> 01:58:36,599
overview of the steps in the button

2727
01:58:34,198 --> 01:58:39,078
mushroom breeding uh production I'm

2728
01:58:36,599 --> 01:58:40,760
going to lay it out and put it all

2729
01:58:39,078 --> 01:58:43,158
together and this is from the

2730
01:58:40,760 --> 01:58:46,079
perspective of a mushroom

2731
01:58:43,158 --> 01:58:48,960
breeder so we'll start with our germ

2732
01:58:46,078 --> 01:58:52,319
plasm as all good breeding programs do

2733
01:58:48,960 --> 01:58:55,319
we have our proprietary mushroom strains

2734
01:58:52,319 --> 01:58:57,759
from these trins we isolate spores we

2735
01:58:55,319 --> 01:58:59,759
let the mushrooms grow and mature and

2736
01:58:57,760 --> 01:59:03,760
then spores will drop and we can pick

2737
01:58:59,760 --> 01:59:06,320
out individual spores isolate them we

2738
01:59:03,760 --> 01:59:08,360
grow these up on plates and let them

2739
01:59:06,319 --> 01:59:11,679
germinate into

2740
01:59:08,359 --> 01:59:14,198
Mycelia Crossing is actually pretty easy

2741
01:59:11,679 --> 01:59:16,679
you can just take a chunk of one Mycelia

2742
01:59:14,198 --> 01:59:19,759
and put it on a plate with another chunk

2743
01:59:16,679 --> 01:59:21,880
from a different one and if you're lucky

2744
01:59:19,760 --> 01:59:22,719
they will hybridize and grow together so

2745
01:59:21,880 --> 01:59:24,520
that's

2746
01:59:22,719 --> 01:59:25,840
they will essentially merge and cross

2747
01:59:24,520 --> 01:59:29,119
with

2748
01:59:25,840 --> 01:59:32,520
itself Oh by itself once we have this

2749
01:59:29,118 --> 01:59:34,319
Melia we transfer this to a mixture of

2750
01:59:32,520 --> 01:59:36,719
grain and nutrients this would be our

2751
01:59:34,319 --> 01:59:39,118
spawn you can see a little more clearly

2752
01:59:36,719 --> 01:59:42,198
in this example a commercial spawn bag

2753
01:59:39,118 --> 01:59:45,198
here with these grow uh breathing

2754
01:59:42,198 --> 01:59:47,598
strips from this spawn we combine the

2755
01:59:45,198 --> 01:59:50,799
spawn and compost and under the correct

2756
01:59:47,599 --> 01:59:53,000
management practices we can grow our

2757
01:59:50,800 --> 01:59:56,599
mushrooms these these mushrooms are then

2758
01:59:53,000 --> 01:59:58,599
harvested and packaged and finally they

2759
01:59:56,599 --> 02:00:00,639
are shipped to the end user where you

2760
01:59:58,599 --> 02:00:02,599
can go to the store and purchase them

2761
02:00:00,639 --> 02:00:05,719
and put them on your pizza or whatever

2762
02:00:02,599 --> 02:00:08,159
you want to do from a breeder

2763
02:00:05,719 --> 02:00:12,279
perspective this growing stage this

2764
02:00:08,158 --> 02:00:15,879
agronomic uh data is used where we uh

2765
02:00:12,279 --> 02:00:18,679
select our mushrooms based on this stage

2766
02:00:15,880 --> 02:00:20,560
however I've highlighted in uh these red

2767
02:00:18,679 --> 02:00:22,279
outlines here there's other

2768
02:00:20,560 --> 02:00:24,520
considerations that we need to think of

2769
02:00:22,279 --> 02:00:26,759
there's other stakeholders involv uh

2770
02:00:24,520 --> 02:00:29,639
involved in this process you need to

2771
02:00:26,760 --> 02:00:31,880
consider uh The Growers how do we make

2772
02:00:29,639 --> 02:00:33,880
this crop grower friendly um and

2773
02:00:31,880 --> 02:00:37,960
resilient to different environmental

2774
02:00:33,880 --> 02:00:41,920
conditions but also um the consumers um

2775
02:00:37,960 --> 02:00:43,880
you know freshness and flavor and um cap

2776
02:00:41,920 --> 02:00:46,199
you know certain cap characteristics are

2777
02:00:43,880 --> 02:00:46,199
also

2778
02:00:46,920 --> 02:00:51,560
important um so I'm going to talk a

2779
02:00:49,719 --> 02:00:53,679
little bit about the cultivation history

2780
02:00:51,560 --> 02:00:57,639
so when I talk about B button mushroom

2781
02:00:53,679 --> 02:01:02,199
breeding um it's a very recent uh

2782
02:00:57,639 --> 02:01:05,319
phenomenon and like any good uh former

2783
02:01:02,198 --> 02:01:06,198
corn person I have to mention ma in one

2784
02:01:05,319 --> 02:01:08,799
of my

2785
02:01:06,198 --> 02:01:11,000
presentations um and I just put this in

2786
02:01:08,800 --> 02:01:13,320
here because this happened maze

2787
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:16,439
domestication happened about you know

2788
02:01:13,319 --> 02:01:18,960
6,000 years ago and I like to highlight

2789
02:01:16,439 --> 02:01:22,879
this because you can see the different

2790
02:01:18,960 --> 02:01:25,520
morphological changes that we that ERS

2791
02:01:22,880 --> 02:01:28,880
um Chang this crop from the wild grass

2792
02:01:25,520 --> 02:01:30,560
tente to the corn that we work with um

2793
02:01:28,880 --> 02:01:32,118
you know and grow on millions of Acres

2794
02:01:30,560 --> 02:01:36,679
around the world

2795
02:01:32,118 --> 02:01:38,598
today so our story our mushroom story

2796
02:01:36,679 --> 02:01:41,078
actually begins in the

2797
02:01:38,599 --> 02:01:43,760
1600s this was the first time there was

2798
02:01:41,078 --> 02:01:46,599
a concerted large scale cultivation and

2799
02:01:43,760 --> 02:01:48,039
this was done in underground uh systems

2800
02:01:46,599 --> 02:01:51,520
in

2801
02:01:48,039 --> 02:01:54,078
France in the 1900s we see large scale

2802
02:01:51,520 --> 02:01:56,719
spawn production in the United States so

2803
02:01:54,078 --> 02:01:59,279
this is consciously generating spawn

2804
02:01:56,719 --> 02:02:02,319
that can be used to grow mushrooms and

2805
02:01:59,279 --> 02:02:05,000
introducing good practices to maintain

2806
02:02:02,319 --> 02:02:06,519
uh single single strains or single lines

2807
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:10,560
of

2808
02:02:06,520 --> 02:02:13,040
Spawn the early 1980s saw a milestone

2809
02:02:10,560 --> 02:02:16,440
development and this was the development

2810
02:02:13,039 --> 02:02:18,078
of the U hor U1 strain this was the

2811
02:02:16,439 --> 02:02:19,919
first time that there was actual

2812
02:02:18,078 --> 02:02:22,920
deliberate Crossing or deliberate

2813
02:02:19,920 --> 02:02:26,920
breeding going on in this crowd

2814
02:02:22,920 --> 02:02:30,279
um I have this uh this gray Arrow here

2815
02:02:26,920 --> 02:02:33,319
because this U1 strain is the progenitor

2816
02:02:30,279 --> 02:02:35,639
for most of the white button mushrooms

2817
02:02:33,319 --> 02:02:39,719
that you will see even

2818
02:02:35,639 --> 02:02:43,078
today 2016 was a big year because there

2819
02:02:39,719 --> 02:02:45,399
was a scientist at Penn State who

2820
02:02:43,078 --> 02:02:47,960
developed a gene edited mushroom with

2821
02:02:45,399 --> 02:02:51,839
the goal of reducing cap

2822
02:02:47,960 --> 02:02:54,679
bruising um however since this there

2823
02:02:51,840 --> 02:02:57,199
there's no actual published paper or

2824
02:02:54,679 --> 02:03:00,359
research from this um all we get with

2825
02:02:57,198 --> 02:03:03,479
was this research highlight um and since

2826
02:03:00,359 --> 02:03:06,759
then there haven't been any commercial

2827
02:03:03,479 --> 02:03:08,919
uh genan edited or transgenic mushrooms

2828
02:03:06,760 --> 02:03:11,920
um on the

2829
02:03:08,920 --> 02:03:14,639
market um looking to the future I think

2830
02:03:11,920 --> 02:03:17,000
it's important to have an open mind with

2831
02:03:14,639 --> 02:03:19,920
not only Gene editing but also where can

2832
02:03:17,000 --> 02:03:22,000
we take the crop I'm going to look back

2833
02:03:19,920 --> 02:03:23,359
at Maze and you can see these dramatic

2834
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:26,279
morphological

2835
02:03:23,359 --> 02:03:28,719
differences um I would argue that right

2836
02:03:26,279 --> 02:03:30,559
now mushrooms are in the still in the

2837
02:03:28,719 --> 02:03:33,359
domestication phase rather than the

2838
02:03:30,560 --> 02:03:35,400
Improvement phase um so I think it'd be

2839
02:03:33,359 --> 02:03:38,238
really I'm really excited to see where

2840
02:03:35,399 --> 02:03:38,238
we can go from

2841
02:03:38,800 --> 02:03:43,239
here and as a genomicist or someone who

2842
02:03:41,679 --> 02:03:45,559
works with sequence data a lot I would

2843
02:03:43,238 --> 02:03:47,558
be remiss if I didn't uh talk about

2844
02:03:45,559 --> 02:03:50,199
reference genomes and the button

2845
02:03:47,559 --> 02:03:53,559
mushroom genome um we had our first

2846
02:03:50,198 --> 02:03:56,439
genome assembly was published in 2012

2847
02:03:53,559 --> 02:03:58,800
and currently we're on version three

2848
02:03:56,439 --> 02:04:01,118
these are genomes for the constituent

2849
02:03:58,800 --> 02:04:03,360
hoc carens of that U1 strain that I

2850
02:04:01,118 --> 02:04:06,319
mentioned and specifically I'm going to

2851
02:04:03,359 --> 02:04:08,719
give some metrics for h97 this was one

2852
02:04:06,319 --> 02:04:11,880
of those haids that were involved in

2853
02:04:08,719 --> 02:04:13,639
that cross there's about 31 million base

2854
02:04:11,880 --> 02:04:16,639
pairs in this genome which would take

2855
02:04:13,639 --> 02:04:19,159
you a long time to count but in more

2856
02:04:16,639 --> 02:04:22,719
like general terms it's similar with

2857
02:04:19,158 --> 02:04:25,759
other fungi but it's not really that big

2858
02:04:22,719 --> 02:04:27,880
um we scaled it here 100 times and you

2859
02:04:25,760 --> 02:04:30,840
can see it's really quite small compared

2860
02:04:27,880 --> 02:04:32,760
to some other popular organisms that are

2861
02:04:30,840 --> 02:04:34,880
that are well studied and this is great

2862
02:04:32,760 --> 02:04:36,920
for anyone who wants to do sequencing or

2863
02:04:34,880 --> 02:04:39,639
genomics because we can sequence a lot

2864
02:04:36,920 --> 02:04:43,359
of things and get great

2865
02:04:39,639 --> 02:04:45,319
coverage um so the Buco is just uh the

2866
02:04:43,359 --> 02:04:47,639
number of single copy orthologues and

2867
02:04:45,319 --> 02:04:49,599
it's used to measure completeness of the

2868
02:04:47,639 --> 02:04:52,480
genome assembly and we're doing pretty

2869
02:04:49,599 --> 02:04:55,840
good at 93% of those orthol present in

2870
02:04:52,479 --> 02:04:59,078
single copy has about 12,000 genes for

2871
02:04:55,840 --> 02:05:01,279
reference it's about half as many gen in

2872
02:04:59,078 --> 02:05:02,759
in humans and about a third as many

2873
02:05:01,279 --> 02:05:05,960
genes in

2874
02:05:02,760 --> 02:05:08,760
Maze and we also have about 12% of the

2875
02:05:05,960 --> 02:05:12,158
genom was found to be transposable

2876
02:05:08,760 --> 02:05:14,480
elements so that was some background and

2877
02:05:12,158 --> 02:05:16,799
now I'm going to get to the meat of all

2878
02:05:14,479 --> 02:05:19,198
of the challenges that we're facing uh

2879
02:05:16,800 --> 02:05:21,000
I've kind of broadly separated them into

2880
02:05:19,198 --> 02:05:23,839
breeding challenges and biological

2881
02:05:21,000 --> 02:05:26,078
challenges but there is going to be some

2882
02:05:23,840 --> 02:05:28,840
overlap um the first challenge is

2883
02:05:26,078 --> 02:05:31,319
there's a brief domestication history uh

2884
02:05:28,840 --> 02:05:33,400
we saw in the earlier slide frosting

2885
02:05:31,319 --> 02:05:35,639
really has only been going on for about

2886
02:05:33,399 --> 02:05:40,000
50 years um in this

2887
02:05:35,639 --> 02:05:43,000
crop um the good news is is that today

2888
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:45,719
we have modern tools like sequencing and

2889
02:05:43,000 --> 02:05:47,559
using good database management and

2890
02:05:45,719 --> 02:05:50,279
experimental design so this will allow

2891
02:05:47,559 --> 02:05:52,599
us to catch up to other

2892
02:05:50,279 --> 02:05:55,639
crops there's also Al this neurogenetic

2893
02:05:52,599 --> 02:05:57,840
base this U1 strain has been around for

2894
02:05:55,639 --> 02:06:01,719
the past 50 years and continues to be

2895
02:05:57,840 --> 02:06:04,520
used uh in many uh commercial programs

2896
02:06:01,719 --> 02:06:08,359
so to introduce diversity we can go back

2897
02:06:04,520 --> 02:06:10,239
and use wild uh wild germ plasm you also

2898
02:06:08,359 --> 02:06:12,759
use molecular tools like create the

2899
02:06:10,238 --> 02:06:14,039
diversity if we can't find it in nature

2900
02:06:12,760 --> 02:06:17,280
this would involve things like

2901
02:06:14,039 --> 02:06:20,000
mutagenesis or Genting again I have to

2902
02:06:17,279 --> 02:06:22,198
mention that no commercial mushrooms

2903
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:23,399
currently exist um that derived from

2904
02:06:22,198 --> 02:06:25,799
those

2905
02:06:23,399 --> 02:06:28,399
tools there's been limited scientific

2906
02:06:25,800 --> 02:06:30,960
research involved obviously it's a niche

2907
02:06:28,399 --> 02:06:33,158
crop and there's only about a handful of

2908
02:06:30,960 --> 02:06:35,639
research institutions in button

2909
02:06:33,158 --> 02:06:39,799
mushrooms around the world so we have

2910
02:06:35,639 --> 02:06:42,000
expertise that is kind of spread thin um

2911
02:06:39,800 --> 02:06:44,079
and as a solution you know it would be

2912
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:46,158
great if we could increase funding gain

2913
02:06:44,078 --> 02:06:48,439
some more awareness um attract a

2914
02:06:46,158 --> 02:06:50,679
different talent pool um and also

2915
02:06:48,439 --> 02:06:53,279
collaborate with people who you know we

2916
02:06:50,679 --> 02:06:55,480
have a small group at company but if we

2917
02:06:53,279 --> 02:06:57,198
can Outsource some work and or some

2918
02:06:55,479 --> 02:06:58,799
questions to other groups that would

2919
02:06:57,198 --> 02:07:00,399
great that would be great and help us

2920
02:06:58,800 --> 02:07:02,800
make

2921
02:07:00,399 --> 02:07:05,598
progress another consideration is it's

2922
02:07:02,800 --> 02:07:08,119
difficult to protect our IP so mushrooms

2923
02:07:05,599 --> 02:07:10,719
kind of exist in this legal limbo

2924
02:07:08,118 --> 02:07:12,920
they're not animals they're not plants

2925
02:07:10,719 --> 02:07:15,359
um we do have the ability to use utility

2926
02:07:12,920 --> 02:07:17,960
patents um so that's that's something

2927
02:07:15,359 --> 02:07:20,839
that's good but in general they can be

2928
02:07:17,960 --> 02:07:22,319
clonally propagated so what would be the

2929
02:07:20,840 --> 02:07:24,800
incentive in spending all of these

2930
02:07:22,319 --> 02:07:26,599
resources to develop a new strain that

2931
02:07:24,800 --> 02:07:30,400
you know a competitor can just go and

2932
02:07:26,599 --> 02:07:32,319
take um without fear of legal

2933
02:07:30,399 --> 02:07:34,519
ramifications and so we would like to

2934
02:07:32,319 --> 02:07:36,960
work more closely with regulatory bodies

2935
02:07:34,520 --> 02:07:39,079
to kind of make sure that we can set a

2936
02:07:36,960 --> 02:07:42,359
legal landscape that would help us

2937
02:07:39,078 --> 02:07:44,759
create and protect um our

2938
02:07:42,359 --> 02:07:46,598
strains on the biological side I've

2939
02:07:44,760 --> 02:07:49,920
hinted at this it's difficult to produce

2940
02:07:46,599 --> 02:07:52,078
our haids um and we also have limited

2941
02:07:49,920 --> 02:07:54,199
genetic recombination

2942
02:07:52,078 --> 02:07:56,799
to address this we can use markers we

2943
02:07:54,198 --> 02:07:59,558
can uh introduce new germ

2944
02:07:56,800 --> 02:08:00,920
plasm um but this is one of the main

2945
02:07:59,559 --> 02:08:03,079
challenges that's been facing the

2946
02:08:00,920 --> 02:08:06,599
industry for for quite some

2947
02:08:03,078 --> 02:08:09,439
time we also have mating types um so

2948
02:08:06,599 --> 02:08:11,400
even if you do isolate haids the the

2949
02:08:09,439 --> 02:08:13,158
presence of mating types means that they

2950
02:08:11,399 --> 02:08:16,000
may not be compatible they may not

2951
02:08:13,158 --> 02:08:17,198
actually fuse together um if they have

2952
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:20,118
the same mating

2953
02:08:17,198 --> 02:08:22,439
type again we can examine to see our

2954
02:08:20,118 --> 02:08:24,960
germ PL if our germ plasm is having this

2955
02:08:22,439 --> 02:08:26,078
certain mating types um using markers

2956
02:08:24,960 --> 02:08:28,359
and

2957
02:08:26,078 --> 02:08:31,118
sequencing mushrooms require specific

2958
02:08:28,359 --> 02:08:33,279
growth conditions um it's it would be

2959
02:08:31,118 --> 02:08:35,519
important to have mushrooms that are

2960
02:08:33,279 --> 02:08:36,880
resilient not only to different

2961
02:08:35,520 --> 02:08:39,599
conditions and different management

2962
02:08:36,880 --> 02:08:42,159
practices but also have the ability to

2963
02:08:39,599 --> 02:08:44,078
adapt to those different uh management

2964
02:08:42,158 --> 02:08:46,078
practices like how much water is being

2965
02:08:44,078 --> 02:08:49,279
used um and what are the temperature

2966
02:08:46,078 --> 02:08:52,078
changes um like in that growing

2967
02:08:49,279 --> 02:08:55,000
environment and last but not least

2968
02:08:52,078 --> 02:08:57,679
um Quality is important so if you've

2969
02:08:55,000 --> 02:08:59,719
ever gone to the grocery store and uh

2970
02:08:57,679 --> 02:09:02,039
tried to purchase mushrooms you know

2971
02:08:59,719 --> 02:09:04,399
that um by the time it gets to the end

2972
02:09:02,039 --> 02:09:07,399
user maybe they're not as fresh as as

2973
02:09:04,399 --> 02:09:09,519
you would hope um well you know we can

2974
02:09:07,399 --> 02:09:11,879
address this by looking at consumer

2975
02:09:09,520 --> 02:09:14,559
panels and breeding making a conscious

2976
02:09:11,880 --> 02:09:16,599
effort to breed for Quality um I have

2977
02:09:14,559 --> 02:09:19,360
Gene editing here as a question mark

2978
02:09:16,599 --> 02:09:22,360
because this was what that 2016 uh Penn

2979
02:09:19,359 --> 02:09:26,198
State researcher was kind of about the

2980
02:09:22,359 --> 02:09:28,279
quality aspect and reducing cap

2981
02:09:26,198 --> 02:09:29,839
bruising okay so I'm going to dive into

2982
02:09:28,279 --> 02:09:32,078
challenge number one was this narrow

2983
02:09:29,840 --> 02:09:34,520
germ plasm base remember when I I said

2984
02:09:32,078 --> 02:09:37,880
we start with these unique strains this

2985
02:09:34,520 --> 02:09:39,599
unique germ plasm well typic actually

2986
02:09:37,880 --> 02:09:43,159
it's kind of harder than it than it

2987
02:09:39,599 --> 02:09:46,199
seems to have that unique strains before

2988
02:09:43,158 --> 02:09:48,238
the 1980s we had these aom arom strains

2989
02:09:46,198 --> 02:09:50,118
where Growers would grow a mushroom they

2990
02:09:48,238 --> 02:09:53,279
would collect these diotic fertile

2991
02:09:50,118 --> 02:09:56,039
spores and culture them up and grow a

2992
02:09:53,279 --> 02:09:57,920
new mushroom from that the problem is is

2993
02:09:56,039 --> 02:10:00,639
there's not really a lot of genetic

2994
02:09:57,920 --> 02:10:02,359
recombination in the crop but we do get

2995
02:10:00,639 --> 02:10:04,440
some rearrangement of the parental

2996
02:10:02,359 --> 02:10:06,880
chromosomes um so you're basically just

2997
02:10:04,439 --> 02:10:08,238
shuffling chromosomes around um these

2998
02:10:06,880 --> 02:10:11,199
different mushroom

2999
02:10:08,238 --> 02:10:13,799
strains and then in the 1980s we saw the

3000
02:10:11,198 --> 02:10:16,799
development of this horse1 strain and it

3001
02:10:13,800 --> 02:10:19,440
was a cross between two haids from

3002
02:10:16,800 --> 02:10:21,840
different traditional strains um

3003
02:10:19,439 --> 02:10:23,638
immediately they saw yield in quality

3004
02:10:21,840 --> 02:10:26,039
improvements compared to the existing

3005
02:10:23,639 --> 02:10:29,520
strains and it achieved rapid market

3006
02:10:26,039 --> 02:10:32,078
dominance that continues to this day to

3007
02:10:29,520 --> 02:10:35,000
get new varieties from this they

3008
02:10:32,078 --> 02:10:37,759
developed uh they took those diotic

3009
02:10:35,000 --> 02:10:39,920
fertile spores like this and grew up new

3010
02:10:37,760 --> 02:10:43,520
mushrooms much like this process that

3011
02:10:39,920 --> 02:10:48,000
was being done um previously so there's

3012
02:10:43,520 --> 02:10:51,599
still not a huge genetic base um for our

3013
02:10:48,000 --> 02:10:53,078
crop okay so we say okay well what if we

3014
02:10:51,599 --> 02:10:55,440
solve this challenge we solved the

3015
02:10:53,078 --> 02:10:58,198
uniqueness challenge well now we can

3016
02:10:55,439 --> 02:11:00,960
just isolate spores right well the

3017
02:10:58,198 --> 02:11:03,399
problem with that is that it's harder

3018
02:11:00,960 --> 02:11:06,039
than it it looks because most spores we

3019
02:11:03,399 --> 02:11:09,960
can't use for breeding we have a unique

3020
02:11:06,039 --> 02:11:12,000
sporogenesis process that inhibits um

3021
02:11:09,960 --> 02:11:14,920
the formation of these

3022
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:18,479
haids so just to demonstrate this here's

3023
02:11:14,920 --> 02:11:22,039
our n plus n our heterokaryon or diotic

3024
02:11:18,479 --> 02:11:26,279
sporar Mushroom in the guilt tissue we

3025
02:11:22,039 --> 02:11:29,279
have again the diotic bidum hanging out

3026
02:11:26,279 --> 02:11:32,158
this will fuse to create our diploid

3027
02:11:29,279 --> 02:11:35,238
zygote and undergo meiosis so in the

3028
02:11:32,158 --> 02:11:37,439
postotic bidum we have our four haid

3029
02:11:35,238 --> 02:11:40,238
nuclei great you're saying what's the

3030
02:11:37,439 --> 02:11:43,719
issue the issue is that as the bidum

3031
02:11:40,238 --> 02:11:45,598
matures those four nuclei get packaged

3032
02:11:43,719 --> 02:11:49,399
differently into the different

3033
02:11:45,599 --> 02:11:52,360
spores so the nuclei migrate into bidia

3034
02:11:49,399 --> 02:11:55,039
spores only about five 5% of the time

3035
02:11:52,359 --> 02:11:57,759
the bidia make homo caran

3036
02:11:55,039 --> 02:11:59,760
spores these are are inbred lines that

3037
02:11:57,760 --> 02:12:03,239
we can use for breeding and they contain

3038
02:11:59,760 --> 02:12:05,719
one haid nuclear type per Spore in this

3039
02:12:03,238 --> 02:12:08,799
diagram I'm coloring nuclear types as

3040
02:12:05,719 --> 02:12:10,399
either the blue color or the red color

3041
02:12:08,800 --> 02:12:12,320
and anytime you see like a little

3042
02:12:10,399 --> 02:12:15,000
segment like this means that there's

3043
02:12:12,319 --> 02:12:17,439
been some kind of cross uh crossover

3044
02:12:15,000 --> 02:12:21,399
event or a different independent

3045
02:12:17,439 --> 02:12:25,919
assortment from the other parent

3046
02:12:21,399 --> 02:12:28,359
95% of the time 95% of the spores we get

3047
02:12:25,920 --> 02:12:28,359
are

3048
02:12:28,520 --> 02:12:33,760
heterocarpa we call these en progyny

3049
02:12:31,279 --> 02:12:36,279
these are self fertile spores and they

3050
02:12:33,760 --> 02:12:38,840
contain the parental type nuclei in the

3051
02:12:36,279 --> 02:12:41,800
same Spore this is also where we get the

3052
02:12:38,840 --> 02:12:44,480
name agaricus by spores because instead

3053
02:12:41,800 --> 02:12:49,239
of like other bidum seeds producing four

3054
02:12:44,479 --> 02:12:52,039
spores our spores we get two spores per

3055
02:12:49,238 --> 02:12:54,678
bidia also rarely

3056
02:12:52,039 --> 02:12:57,880
we get these s progy and this is where

3057
02:12:54,679 --> 02:13:01,158
the sister nuclei from the from the

3058
02:12:57,880 --> 02:13:03,920
meiosis get packaged in the same Spore

3059
02:13:01,158 --> 02:13:06,399
and this has variable self fertility we

3060
02:13:03,920 --> 02:13:08,440
don't know if there was a re combination

3061
02:13:06,399 --> 02:13:11,399
event with a different mating type which

3062
02:13:08,439 --> 02:13:13,839
would allow it to be uh fertile or not

3063
02:13:11,399 --> 02:13:15,719
but this this is a huge challenge

3064
02:13:13,840 --> 02:13:17,760
because when you look at the spores that

3065
02:13:15,719 --> 02:13:20,559
we can use for breeding that have some

3066
02:13:17,760 --> 02:13:21,639
re combination it's just these two

3067
02:13:20,559 --> 02:13:24,119
scenarios

3068
02:13:21,639 --> 02:13:25,800
out of these more vastly more common

3069
02:13:24,118 --> 02:13:27,960
scenarios

3070
02:13:25,800 --> 02:13:29,920
here a third challenge is a low

3071
02:13:27,960 --> 02:13:32,158
recombination rate so we have this

3072
02:13:29,920 --> 02:13:34,078
meiosis occurring in the developing

3073
02:13:32,158 --> 02:13:36,198
bidum and there's not a lot of

3074
02:13:34,078 --> 02:13:39,880
recombination the recombination we do

3075
02:13:36,198 --> 02:13:42,359
get is in subtel regions I pulled this

3076
02:13:39,880 --> 02:13:45,880
figure from a 2016 paper and it's

3077
02:13:42,359 --> 02:13:50,118
showing the hype of a commercial uh

3078
02:13:45,880 --> 02:13:53,078
White strain so the blue represents the

3079
02:13:50,118 --> 02:13:56,279
sequence that was direct from the U1

3080
02:13:53,078 --> 02:13:59,319
homo caran h97 and the red is the

3081
02:13:56,279 --> 02:14:02,039
sequence from the U1 h39 homar and you

3082
02:13:59,319 --> 02:14:05,078
can see this is a commercial strain and

3083
02:14:02,039 --> 02:14:07,439
it's essentially the same as the U1

3084
02:14:05,078 --> 02:14:09,238
strain with some a little bit of

3085
02:14:07,439 --> 02:14:12,839
crossover

3086
02:14:09,238 --> 02:14:14,718
events we do have the advantage I guess

3087
02:14:12,840 --> 02:14:16,800
that it's we have appear to have normal

3088
02:14:14,719 --> 02:14:20,000
independent assortment of homologous

3089
02:14:16,800 --> 02:14:22,320
chromosomes and this is what we uh this

3090
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:25,880
is the end result here we get a little

3091
02:14:22,319 --> 02:14:28,039
bit of uh recombination if you will or

3092
02:14:25,880 --> 02:14:30,639
different uh parental material in these

3093
02:14:28,039 --> 02:14:34,198
spores but you can see that overall

3094
02:14:30,639 --> 02:14:36,719
these spores maintain heter

3095
02:14:34,198 --> 02:14:38,919
zygosity we have a lot of approaches to

3096
02:14:36,719 --> 02:14:42,118
these life cycle challenges and they

3097
02:14:38,920 --> 02:14:44,520
involve a lot of manual labor um so we

3098
02:14:42,118 --> 02:14:46,359
collect a lot of single Sport isolates

3099
02:14:44,520 --> 02:14:49,280
and then culture them up to

3100
02:14:46,359 --> 02:14:52,279
Melia um we're always looking for ways

3101
02:14:49,279 --> 02:14:54,439
to automate this um and you know one

3102
02:14:52,279 --> 02:14:56,519
potential way we can do this is by

3103
02:14:54,439 --> 02:15:00,000
looking at also is by looking at

3104
02:14:56,520 --> 02:15:04,119
differential or seleced media to choose

3105
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:07,039
to select for or against heids or di

3106
02:15:04,118 --> 02:15:10,759
carons we also screen Mycelia visually

3107
02:15:07,039 --> 02:15:13,238
in general the haids um are they don't

3108
02:15:10,760 --> 02:15:15,599
perform they don't grow as fast as the

3109
02:15:13,238 --> 02:15:17,879
heterocaryons this is not always the

3110
02:15:15,599 --> 02:15:20,520
case however so instead we can use

3111
02:15:17,880 --> 02:15:21,480
markers we have molecular markers for

3112
02:15:20,520 --> 02:15:23,440
mating typ

3113
02:15:21,479 --> 02:15:26,879
and cap color and some others around the

3114
02:15:23,439 --> 02:15:29,279
genome um and this is very useful for

3115
02:15:26,880 --> 02:15:32,760
screening we also screen them to

3116
02:15:29,279 --> 02:15:34,599
determine poyy status so from a

3117
02:15:32,760 --> 02:15:35,800
bioinformatics perspective where I'm

3118
02:15:34,599 --> 02:15:37,480
coming from this is pretty

3119
02:15:35,800 --> 02:15:40,199
straightforward uh we can look at the

3120
02:15:37,479 --> 02:15:41,118
sequence metrics alignments and do some

3121
02:15:40,198 --> 02:15:43,558
variant

3122
02:15:41,118 --> 02:15:45,319
calling but ultimately our long-term

3123
02:15:43,559 --> 02:15:47,679
goals are we want to increase those

3124
02:15:45,319 --> 02:15:49,558
recombination rates and the frequency of

3125
02:15:47,679 --> 02:15:52,719
pacaran bidia

3126
02:15:49,559 --> 02:15:55,159
spores uh some routes for this are using

3127
02:15:52,719 --> 02:15:57,880
existing genetic variation for rec

3128
02:15:55,158 --> 02:16:00,399
combination rate and again if we don't

3129
02:15:57,880 --> 02:16:02,719
have that using potentially using some

3130
02:16:00,399 --> 02:16:04,319
molecular tricks or techniques um that I

3131
02:16:02,719 --> 02:16:07,078
mentioned

3132
02:16:04,319 --> 02:16:09,000
earlier our fourth challenge is this

3133
02:16:07,078 --> 02:16:11,639
challenge about mating types so even if

3134
02:16:09,000 --> 02:16:13,800
we do isolate our genetically unique

3135
02:16:11,639 --> 02:16:15,840
spores and culture them up you put them

3136
02:16:13,800 --> 02:16:18,279
on a plate they won't always grow

3137
02:16:15,840 --> 02:16:20,319
together and create that hybrid you'll

3138
02:16:18,279 --> 02:16:21,840
know if you have a compatible reaction

3139
02:16:20,319 --> 02:16:25,679
because you'll see see the formation of

3140
02:16:21,840 --> 02:16:27,480
this fluffy aerial Melia that's diotic

3141
02:16:25,679 --> 02:16:30,719
and this requires Different oals At The

3142
02:16:27,479 --> 02:16:33,439
Mating type Locus a 1994 paper by

3143
02:16:30,719 --> 02:16:35,879
carrian at all identified eight mating

3144
02:16:33,439 --> 02:16:38,599
types and we have also identified a lot

3145
02:16:35,879 --> 02:16:40,159
more mating types than just one or two

3146
02:16:38,599 --> 02:16:42,239
however you'll see the most popular

3147
02:16:40,159 --> 02:16:44,558
mating types are mating types one and

3148
02:16:42,239 --> 02:16:47,000
two and this is because these were the

3149
02:16:44,558 --> 02:16:51,159
mating types that were found in that U1

3150
02:16:47,000 --> 02:16:53,239
strain that we made 50 years ago

3151
02:16:51,159 --> 02:16:56,599
um we can use tester lines to determine

3152
02:16:53,239 --> 02:16:59,280
mating types however um you know we like

3153
02:16:56,599 --> 02:17:01,519
to think we're you know moving along and

3154
02:16:59,280 --> 02:17:04,079
progressing so these days we use PCR

3155
02:17:01,519 --> 02:17:06,719
markers um the older markers were good

3156
02:17:04,079 --> 02:17:10,120
at uh distinguishing mating types one

3157
02:17:06,718 --> 02:17:11,919
and two but now we have uh better tools

3158
02:17:10,120 --> 02:17:14,519
where we we've sequenced different haet

3159
02:17:11,920 --> 02:17:17,200
types and we can use uh that sequence to

3160
02:17:14,519 --> 02:17:19,800
make uh markers this is work done by a

3161
02:17:17,200 --> 02:17:21,719
research scientist uh Daniel Steel and

3162
02:17:19,799 --> 02:17:24,358
we can see on this gel it can easily

3163
02:17:21,718 --> 02:17:28,318
distinguish a homar containing just a

3164
02:17:24,359 --> 02:17:31,599
single um M1 band from for example a

3165
02:17:28,318 --> 02:17:33,959
hetar that has this M1 band but also a

3166
02:17:31,599 --> 02:17:36,359
mating type 3

3167
02:17:33,959 --> 02:17:38,438
band um also want to quickly highlight

3168
02:17:36,359 --> 02:17:40,479
some trait mapping work so I know trait

3169
02:17:38,439 --> 02:17:42,479
mapping isn't as sexy as it was like 20

3170
02:17:40,478 --> 02:17:45,119
years ago but remember like we're still

3171
02:17:42,478 --> 02:17:47,558
kind of figuring out this breeding thing

3172
02:17:45,120 --> 02:17:49,439
um so the existing maps that were out

3173
02:17:47,558 --> 02:17:50,358
there they weren't really sufficient and

3174
02:17:49,439 --> 02:17:51,479
sometimes they're missing whole

3175
02:17:50,359 --> 02:17:53,519
chromosomes

3176
02:17:51,478 --> 02:17:56,039
so we said okay roll up our sleeves like

3177
02:17:53,519 --> 02:17:58,280
we can get this done ourselves we did

3178
02:17:56,040 --> 02:18:00,000
the a regular way you would go about you

3179
02:17:58,280 --> 02:18:02,280
know doing a trait mapping study

3180
02:18:00,000 --> 02:18:04,799
assemble some diversity sequence it

3181
02:18:02,280 --> 02:18:08,639
measurement and here's just a highlight

3182
02:18:04,799 --> 02:18:11,159
um of some unfiltered data set uh here

3183
02:18:08,638 --> 02:18:14,358
we found this qtl for cap color on

3184
02:18:11,159 --> 02:18:17,679
chromosome 8 um this has also been found

3185
02:18:14,359 --> 02:18:21,399
uh uh independently by other research

3186
02:18:17,679 --> 02:18:23,079
groups in the future of musroom research

3187
02:18:21,398 --> 02:18:25,879
I really think we need some more basic

3188
02:18:23,079 --> 02:18:28,679
research to break this cycle we need to

3189
02:18:25,879 --> 02:18:30,558
look into meiosis and sporogenesis and

3190
02:18:28,679 --> 02:18:33,558
figure out what is the genetic control

3191
02:18:30,558 --> 02:18:34,959
of this packaging um and what is wrong

3192
02:18:33,558 --> 02:18:38,039
with us that we can't get the

3193
02:18:34,959 --> 02:18:40,759
recombination that we see in other crops

3194
02:18:38,040 --> 02:18:42,760
um somaclonal variation is also and

3195
02:18:40,760 --> 02:18:45,439
epigenetics are also important because

3196
02:18:42,760 --> 02:18:47,120
this is a clonally propagated uh crop

3197
02:18:45,439 --> 02:18:49,479
and so anytime you have this

3198
02:18:47,120 --> 02:18:51,719
subculturing being done um this is

3199
02:18:49,478 --> 02:18:53,519
immediately where my mind goes

3200
02:18:51,718 --> 02:18:55,159
the cellular composition and sub genome

3201
02:18:53,519 --> 02:18:57,200
dominance are some aspects that we

3202
02:18:55,159 --> 02:18:59,558
should also consider because we have

3203
02:18:57,200 --> 02:19:01,679
these two different parents essentially

3204
02:18:59,558 --> 02:19:03,879
existing in the same cell so how does

3205
02:19:01,679 --> 02:19:05,359
that affect things like expression Is

3206
02:19:03,879 --> 02:19:06,438
this different across tissue types or

3207
02:19:05,359 --> 02:19:08,800
growth

3208
02:19:06,439 --> 02:19:10,318
stages lastly I'd like to test

3209
02:19:08,799 --> 02:19:13,119
traditional methods in the words of my

3210
02:19:10,318 --> 02:19:15,000
former advisor trust but verify so the

3211
02:19:13,120 --> 02:19:17,559
mushroom industry has been doing things

3212
02:19:15,000 --> 02:19:19,920
for a certain way for a certain for a

3213
02:19:17,558 --> 02:19:22,119
long period of years um and it would be

3214
02:19:19,920 --> 02:19:23,719
great just to approach this with a with

3215
02:19:22,120 --> 02:19:26,479
a new

3216
02:19:23,718 --> 02:19:28,318
eyes in the future for our company um

3217
02:19:26,478 --> 02:19:30,599
we're still all about variety release we

3218
02:19:28,318 --> 02:19:32,760
have a new white strain that's gaining

3219
02:19:30,599 --> 02:19:34,318
popularity we also have a very

3220
02:19:32,760 --> 02:19:37,079
successful Brown strain that's coming

3221
02:19:34,318 --> 02:19:39,199
off patent um currently and we're always

3222
02:19:37,079 --> 02:19:42,159
looking to make things more efficient um

3223
02:19:39,200 --> 02:19:44,200
through screening or triing from for me

3224
02:19:42,159 --> 02:19:45,959
a genomicist I think genomic selection

3225
02:19:44,200 --> 02:19:48,800
would be a very interesting route uh to

3226
02:19:45,959 --> 02:19:51,239
go down again we also do basic research

3227
02:19:48,799 --> 02:19:53,279
we're scaling up our sequencing um

3228
02:19:51,239 --> 02:19:55,280
efforts we're also looking at having

3229
02:19:53,280 --> 02:19:56,200
some Partnerships to help us tackle some

3230
02:19:55,280 --> 02:19:58,520
of these

3231
02:19:56,200 --> 02:20:01,359
challenges and then having an open mind

3232
02:19:58,520 --> 02:20:03,200
thinking about alternative uses um about

3233
02:20:01,359 --> 02:20:04,840
the what about metabolites secondary

3234
02:20:03,200 --> 02:20:07,399
metabolites can we Market

3235
02:20:04,840 --> 02:20:10,359
neutraceuticals more um are there health

3236
02:20:07,398 --> 02:20:12,719
benefits among about that and then using

3237
02:20:10,359 --> 02:20:14,479
mushrooms for textiles or environmental

3238
02:20:12,719 --> 02:20:15,920
remediation and then not only

3239
02:20:14,478 --> 02:20:18,279
considering the button mushroom there's

3240
02:20:15,920 --> 02:20:20,200
a lot of other mushrooms out there um

3241
02:20:18,280 --> 02:20:22,399
just being open to thinking about how

3242
02:20:20,200 --> 02:20:25,520
can we Brea those other

3243
02:20:22,398 --> 02:20:27,079
systems so thank you uh for having me uh

3244
02:20:25,520 --> 02:20:29,600
here's some acknowledgements I'd like to

3245
02:20:27,079 --> 02:20:32,200
thank the The Graduate students and ca

3246
02:20:29,600 --> 02:20:34,479
for this Symposium you know the

3247
02:20:32,200 --> 02:20:37,159
engagement has been great I also want to

3248
02:20:34,478 --> 02:20:38,719
thank my co-workers um that you know

3249
02:20:37,159 --> 02:20:41,000
they're they they work hard they have

3250
02:20:38,719 --> 02:20:43,039
good attitudes and you know we all were

3251
02:20:41,000 --> 02:20:48,200
working on this really frustrating but

3252
02:20:43,040 --> 02:20:48,200
also fun crop so thank you

3253
02:20:54,318 --> 02:20:59,959
the reason yeah so the reason for

3254
02:20:56,799 --> 02:21:03,079
calling it a hybrid is because

3255
02:20:59,959 --> 02:21:05,079
essentially it is we have a hpid

3256
02:21:03,079 --> 02:21:07,120
combined with another hpid like our

3257
02:21:05,079 --> 02:21:10,200
gametes like our pollen you know like in

3258
02:21:07,120 --> 02:21:13,760
corn but they just they live together in

3259
02:21:10,200 --> 02:21:16,200
the same cell before you know uh I guess

3260
02:21:13,760 --> 02:21:20,880
yeah getting

3261
02:21:16,200 --> 02:21:23,680
together I do think that we um when I

3262
02:21:20,879 --> 02:21:26,398
think of hybrids like maze I think of

3263
02:21:23,680 --> 02:21:29,398
heterosis you know complimentary Gene

3264
02:21:26,398 --> 02:21:32,478
action things like that um and that is

3265
02:21:29,398 --> 02:21:33,358
something that we have seen um so to

3266
02:21:32,478 --> 02:21:36,599
have

3267
02:21:33,359 --> 02:21:38,280
some different different hloy different

3268
02:21:36,600 --> 02:21:41,559
nuclear types coming together that has

3269
02:21:38,280 --> 02:21:41,560
been very productive for

3270
02:21:45,478 --> 02:21:52,039
us we have not done that to my knowledge

3271
02:21:49,879 --> 02:21:54,839
um I think that would be very

3272
02:21:52,040 --> 02:21:57,399
interesting to

3273
02:21:54,840 --> 02:22:01,760
examine um yes sorry thank you the

3274
02:21:57,398 --> 02:22:04,760
question was um can we distinguish the

3275
02:22:01,760 --> 02:22:07,559
homo caran versus the heterocaryons by

3276
02:22:04,760 --> 02:22:10,680
flow cell cytometry is that correct and

3277
02:22:07,559 --> 02:22:10,680
where that is something that's

3278
02:22:12,318 --> 02:22:16,600
interesting that's a good question I I

3279
02:22:14,439 --> 02:22:18,159
don't know the answer to that I think

3280
02:22:16,600 --> 02:22:19,800
that would be something that we could

3281
02:22:18,159 --> 02:22:21,719
definitely Market I think we would be

3282
02:22:19,799 --> 02:22:23,840
very competitive in that compared to

3283
02:22:21,719 --> 02:22:26,920
some of those other mentions so he was

3284
02:22:23,840 --> 02:22:29,318
asking about the uh efficiency of the

3285
02:22:26,920 --> 02:22:32,079
mushrooms compared to chickens or or

3286
02:22:29,318 --> 02:22:34,398
other energy sources but essentially

3287
02:22:32,079 --> 02:22:36,478
with you know I think it's I think we

3288
02:22:34,398 --> 02:22:39,879
would we would come out pretty well in

3289
02:22:36,478 --> 02:22:41,959
that regard um especially with you know

3290
02:22:39,879 --> 02:22:45,318
climate change friendly and like vegan

3291
02:22:41,959 --> 02:22:48,318
Alternatives being more and more

3292
02:22:45,318 --> 02:22:48,318
common

3293
02:22:48,959 --> 02:22:55,318
uh yes um so their question was what

3294
02:22:53,280 --> 02:22:58,760
kind of wild germ plasm are we talking

3295
02:22:55,318 --> 02:23:01,119
about um and what do they look like

3296
02:22:58,760 --> 02:23:02,960
there there are some wild strains that

3297
02:23:01,120 --> 02:23:05,319
are part of a collection there was a big

3298
02:23:02,959 --> 02:23:09,079
collection effort that happened in the

3299
02:23:05,318 --> 02:23:13,559
1990s um we do have access to a lot of

3300
02:23:09,079 --> 02:23:17,639
those strains um in our program a lot of

3301
02:23:13,559 --> 02:23:19,760
those those strains are very small um so

3302
02:23:17,639 --> 02:23:24,079
the the size of the mushroom is very

3303
02:23:19,760 --> 02:23:27,719
small and they don't always grow in the

3304
02:23:24,079 --> 02:23:31,159
evenly distribution even distribution um

3305
02:23:27,719 --> 02:23:34,079
around on the surface furthermore they

3306
02:23:31,159 --> 02:23:37,119
open up very quickly so they complete

3307
02:23:34,079 --> 02:23:38,639
their life cycle um from the mushroom

3308
02:23:37,120 --> 02:23:40,160
development and then they open up their

3309
02:23:38,639 --> 02:23:42,159
caps want to release their spores

3310
02:23:40,159 --> 02:23:45,000
immediately kind of like seed dispersal

3311
02:23:42,159 --> 02:23:46,879
in other in other crops and we really

3312
02:23:45,000 --> 02:23:49,799
don't want to see that we want to see a

3313
02:23:46,879 --> 02:23:52,318
mushroom that is very slow and like hold

3314
02:23:49,799 --> 02:23:54,159
on and doesn't mature that fast because

3315
02:23:52,318 --> 02:23:55,840
then we can you know it makes it easier

3316
02:23:54,159 --> 02:23:58,439
to ship it around and you get the

3317
02:23:55,840 --> 02:24:01,200
consumer gets a fresher mushroom um so

3318
02:23:58,439 --> 02:24:05,680
yeah the size uh of the mushroom and

3319
02:24:01,200 --> 02:24:05,680
like the speed and their their growth

3320
02:24:07,879 --> 02:24:14,039
pattern yes um so the question was

3321
02:24:10,799 --> 02:24:16,719
asking about the myio composition um

3322
02:24:14,040 --> 02:24:18,279
during the flushes of the Harvest

3323
02:24:16,719 --> 02:24:21,159
successive harvests and then also what

3324
02:24:18,279 --> 02:24:25,399
do we do with the compost um so to

3325
02:24:21,159 --> 02:24:27,239
answer the first question um we do see a

3326
02:24:25,398 --> 02:24:29,879
little bit more colonization with each

3327
02:24:27,239 --> 02:24:31,559
flush so we do have multiple flushes and

3328
02:24:29,879 --> 02:24:35,398
with each flush the mushrooms will come

3329
02:24:31,559 --> 02:24:37,199
up um again a little bit in general the

3330
02:24:35,398 --> 02:24:40,398
pattern is like the first flush will be

3331
02:24:37,200 --> 02:24:42,640
the most productive second flush will be

3332
02:24:40,398 --> 02:24:44,680
okay and then the third flush um that's

3333
02:24:42,639 --> 02:24:46,840
where like Growers uh typically make

3334
02:24:44,680 --> 02:24:50,520
their money even though there's because

3335
02:24:46,840 --> 02:24:53,159
these are a little bit um tight um

3336
02:24:50,520 --> 02:24:55,680
harvesting but the third flush uh will

3337
02:24:53,159 --> 02:24:58,719
have fewer mushrooms U but they'll still

3338
02:24:55,680 --> 02:25:01,318
be around and after that third flush we

3339
02:24:58,719 --> 02:25:05,000
can we do we can use that compost and

3340
02:25:01,318 --> 02:25:06,760
recycle that back into our production um

3341
02:25:05,000 --> 02:25:10,000
because that's becoming a bigger thing

3342
02:25:06,760 --> 02:25:12,279
with the scarcity of Pete um and you

3343
02:25:10,000 --> 02:25:15,120
know climate change and trying to

3344
02:25:12,279 --> 02:25:17,479
consider alternative composts um since

3345
02:25:15,120 --> 02:25:20,880
we are developing and like creating our

3346
02:25:17,478 --> 02:25:22,719
own composts um you know it it quick

3347
02:25:20,879 --> 02:25:25,398
adds up and we we try to have a very

3348
02:25:22,719 --> 02:25:27,719
consistent product um but when we're

3349
02:25:25,398 --> 02:25:28,879
making these huge batches uh you know we

3350
02:25:27,719 --> 02:25:31,079
just we have to be sure that we're

3351
02:25:28,879 --> 02:25:33,879
testing them to make sure the percent

3352
02:25:31,079 --> 02:25:36,719
nitrogen is within certain guidelines

3353
02:25:33,879 --> 02:25:40,599
and the percent um you know whatever is

3354
02:25:36,719 --> 02:25:40,599
is as consistent as we can get

3355
02:25:43,159 --> 02:25:51,079
it um yeah so the question was how do we

3356
02:25:46,879 --> 02:25:55,318
prevent fungal pathogens of our fungus

3357
02:25:51,079 --> 02:26:00,239
uh during the growing and we have a IPM

3358
02:25:55,318 --> 02:26:03,639
system so we have during the Harvest our

3359
02:26:00,239 --> 02:26:07,159
Harvesters will use gloves um and like

3360
02:26:03,639 --> 02:26:09,239
we have a decontamination like protocol

3361
02:26:07,159 --> 02:26:14,079
um so that's just keeping maintaining

3362
02:26:09,239 --> 02:26:18,840
like clean uh you know practices helps

3363
02:26:14,079 --> 02:26:20,920
um we also have a pest that is difficult

3364
02:26:18,840 --> 02:26:22,960
to somewhat difficult

3365
02:26:20,920 --> 02:26:24,239
because it can fly it can move around so

3366
02:26:22,959 --> 02:26:26,039
we have there'd be like these small

3367
02:26:24,239 --> 02:26:27,478
flies if you have like house planks it

3368
02:26:26,040 --> 02:26:29,560
would be like fungus snats they kind of

3369
02:26:27,478 --> 02:26:33,000
look like fungus Nets and those can be

3370
02:26:29,559 --> 02:26:34,840
vectors for um some diseases like on on

3371
02:26:33,000 --> 02:26:37,840
the Caps or whatever they can spread

3372
02:26:34,840 --> 02:26:40,719
that um and so to control for those we

3373
02:26:37,840 --> 02:26:42,680
have like fly paper um like at the

3374
02:26:40,719 --> 02:26:44,119
entrances and exits of our growing rooms

3375
02:26:42,680 --> 02:26:46,680
and that really helps cut down on some

3376
02:26:44,120 --> 02:26:46,680
of that

3377
02:26:49,040 --> 02:26:52,399
disease yeah

3378
02:26:50,799 --> 02:26:55,398
um that's a good question so the

3379
02:26:52,398 --> 02:26:59,199
question was asking about um how easy is

3380
02:26:55,398 --> 02:27:02,358
it to transform mushrooms or use some of

3381
02:26:59,200 --> 02:27:04,760
these molecular tools um it seems from

3382
02:27:02,359 --> 02:27:07,439
Reading literature uh this has been done

3383
02:27:04,760 --> 02:27:09,960
in other crops and other similar

3384
02:27:07,439 --> 02:27:12,079
mushroomy type crops um for example

3385
02:27:09,959 --> 02:27:13,559
yeast is a is a fungus and that's pretty

3386
02:27:12,079 --> 02:27:16,039
amenable to

3387
02:27:13,559 --> 02:27:19,840
transformation um and you know that

3388
02:27:16,040 --> 02:27:23,359
paper that 2016 Gene editing uh you know

3389
02:27:19,840 --> 02:27:26,920
study that came out it seems like there

3390
02:27:23,359 --> 02:27:30,318
was some potential there but I I think

3391
02:27:26,920 --> 02:27:33,200
that from looking at the landscape um

3392
02:27:30,318 --> 02:27:34,879
before we can really start you know

3393
02:27:33,200 --> 02:27:37,479
diving into that we need to make sure

3394
02:27:34,879 --> 02:27:40,000
that it's going to be consumer accepted

3395
02:27:37,478 --> 02:27:41,719
mushrooms are already kind of you know

3396
02:27:40,000 --> 02:27:44,920
people feel a certain way about them

3397
02:27:41,719 --> 02:27:48,239
compared to like plants um so you know

3398
02:27:44,920 --> 02:27:51,719
we don't want to like you know shake the

3399
02:27:48,239 --> 02:27:52,879
boat too much about that um so yeah I I

3400
02:27:51,719 --> 02:27:54,879
agree I think it would be really

3401
02:27:52,879 --> 02:27:57,639
exciting if we if we could be able to

3402
02:27:54,879 --> 02:27:57,639
use some of those

3403
02:27:58,639 --> 02:28:05,398
tools um so the question was how can we

3404
02:28:01,359 --> 02:28:07,920
improve shelf life of mushrooms um so in

3405
02:28:05,398 --> 02:28:11,358
terms of thinking of post Harvest uh

3406
02:28:07,920 --> 02:28:12,879
factors having a strong supply chain is

3407
02:28:11,359 --> 02:28:15,680
one way you can do it you can control

3408
02:28:12,879 --> 02:28:17,839
the environment uh making sure that you

3409
02:28:15,680 --> 02:28:20,559
slow down the mushroom biology with cool

3410
02:28:17,840 --> 02:28:22,200
temperatures you can manage the humidity

3411
02:28:20,559 --> 02:28:25,159
um and that has stuff to do with like

3412
02:28:22,200 --> 02:28:27,000
the shipping and the packaging aspect on

3413
02:28:25,159 --> 02:28:30,239
the genetic side of things we can also

3414
02:28:27,000 --> 02:28:33,559
kind of modify that where we want to

3415
02:28:30,239 --> 02:28:36,279
read mushrooms that have that keep their

3416
02:28:33,559 --> 02:28:38,920
uh gills closed they have their caps and

3417
02:28:36,279 --> 02:28:40,880
they don't open up and mature so they

3418
02:28:38,920 --> 02:28:43,279
like they get all nasty and spores and

3419
02:28:40,879 --> 02:28:45,679
stuff like that um there is genetic

3420
02:28:43,279 --> 02:28:48,040
variation for that and so that's like an

3421
02:28:45,680 --> 02:28:48,880
important uh breeding Target that we're

3422
02:28:48,040 --> 02:28:51,800
looking

3423
02:28:48,879 --> 02:28:55,719
at than next I would like to introduce

much like the wonderful person she is

3440
02:29:34,159 --> 02:29:39,239
and she'll be presenting her wonderful

3441
02:29:35,840 --> 02:29:42,439
talk on um not your typical crop growing

3442
02:29:39,239 --> 02:29:45,520
resilient seaweed for a warming

3443
02:29:42,439 --> 02:29:47,279
ocean thank you can you hear me okay

3444
02:29:45,520 --> 02:29:49,439
thank you Bashi for that wonderful

3445
02:29:47,279 --> 02:29:50,920
introduction and thank you all for being

3446
02:29:49,439 --> 02:29:52,720
here in a big thank you to the

3447
02:29:50,920 --> 02:29:54,799
organizing committee for all your hard

3448
02:29:52,719 --> 02:29:57,599
work putting on this awesome

3449
02:29:54,799 --> 02:30:01,599
Symposium um I'm excited to continue the

3450
02:29:57,600 --> 02:30:03,720
theme of not plants um talking about

3451
02:30:01,600 --> 02:30:05,439
some of the work I've been leading as a

3452
02:30:03,719 --> 02:30:07,799
postto at woodo oceanographic

3453
02:30:05,439 --> 02:30:10,079
institution over the last year and a

3454
02:30:07,799 --> 02:30:14,278
half or so where we are growing

3455
02:30:10,079 --> 02:30:14,279
resilient seaweed for a warming

3456
02:30:14,639 --> 02:30:19,519
ocean so I did do my undergraduate

3457
02:30:17,478 --> 02:30:21,239
degree here at Cornell um but at the

3458
02:30:19,520 --> 02:30:24,720
time I was really mostly interested in

3459
02:30:21,239 --> 02:30:27,159
animals and behavior and physiology so

3460
02:30:24,719 --> 02:30:29,760
probably the most plant related thing I

3461
02:30:27,159 --> 02:30:32,760
did was in my art of horticulture class

3462
02:30:29,760 --> 02:30:36,439
I helped to build this sad sofa which

3463
02:30:32,760 --> 02:30:38,478
still exists next to Trillium um and I

3464
02:30:36,439 --> 02:30:40,920
was really excited to get started in

3465
02:30:38,478 --> 02:30:43,438
research as an undergraduate I worked um

3466
02:30:40,920 --> 02:30:45,920
with shrimp parasites in the Chesapeake

3467
02:30:43,439 --> 02:30:47,800
Bay and spent a summer at scholes Marine

3468
02:30:45,920 --> 02:30:50,000
Lab which is co-run by Cornell and

3469
02:30:47,799 --> 02:30:52,879
University of New Hampshire studying

3470
02:30:50,000 --> 02:30:55,000
caring goal chick development and growth

3471
02:30:52,879 --> 02:30:56,398
while avoiding being dive bombed in the

3472
02:30:55,000 --> 02:30:58,159
head by their

3473
02:30:56,398 --> 02:31:00,799
parents

3474
02:30:58,159 --> 02:31:04,200
um but my world really opened up when I

3475
02:31:00,799 --> 02:31:06,159
got the chance to experience seaweed um

3476
02:31:04,200 --> 02:31:09,319
for the first time when I did a full

3477
02:31:06,159 --> 02:31:11,200
bright Fellowship in Chile and my

3478
02:31:09,318 --> 02:31:14,079
research there was centered around kelp

3479
02:31:11,200 --> 02:31:16,159
forest ecology and also uh kelp

3480
02:31:14,079 --> 02:31:17,600
harvesting strategies and impacts of

3481
02:31:16,159 --> 02:31:20,159
harvesting different harvesting

3482
02:31:17,600 --> 02:31:22,600
strategies on the recruitment of

3483
02:31:20,159 --> 02:31:24,079
invertebrates in the kelp forest so I

3484
02:31:22,600 --> 02:31:26,720
got the chance to travel around the

3485
02:31:24,079 --> 02:31:28,879
country and speak to fishermen and kelp

3486
02:31:26,719 --> 02:31:32,039
Harvesters who were harvesting this

3487
02:31:28,879 --> 02:31:35,318
resource and um I was just really um

3488
02:31:32,040 --> 02:31:38,040
impressed by not only the ecological

3489
02:31:35,318 --> 02:31:40,600
importance of kelp for providing this

3490
02:31:38,040 --> 02:31:43,520
Foundation foundational habitat for lots

3491
02:31:40,600 --> 02:31:45,680
of fish and invertebrates but also the

3492
02:31:43,520 --> 02:31:48,040
importance that kelp has in human

3493
02:31:45,680 --> 02:31:50,680
societies um anywhere on the Central

3494
02:31:48,040 --> 02:31:54,560
Coast of Chile you could find kelp being

3495
02:31:50,680 --> 02:31:57,680
sold in dried bundles at uh fish

3496
02:31:54,559 --> 02:31:59,478
markets so I was really excited to

3497
02:31:57,680 --> 02:32:02,279
continue studying kelp for my

3498
02:31:59,478 --> 02:32:04,318
dissertation work at UC Santa Cruz and

3499
02:32:02,279 --> 02:32:06,800
in particular I was fascinated by the

3500
02:32:04,318 --> 02:32:09,519
morphology of giant Cal which was in

3501
02:32:06,799 --> 02:32:11,959
that last image as well and how it

3502
02:32:09,520 --> 02:32:14,479
exists in these two different forms that

3503
02:32:11,959 --> 02:32:16,278
if you dive down below to the hold fast

3504
02:32:14,478 --> 02:32:18,519
this structure that holds the kelp to

3505
02:32:16,279 --> 02:32:20,279
the rocks at the bottom sometimes the

3506
02:32:18,520 --> 02:32:23,079
giant kelp would have this kind of

3507
02:32:20,279 --> 02:32:25,079
conical mounding hold fast and other

3508
02:32:23,079 --> 02:32:26,879
times it would have this elongated

3509
02:32:25,079 --> 02:32:29,359
flattened stretched out looking hold

3510
02:32:26,879 --> 02:32:31,639
fast and I was just so curious as to how

3511
02:32:29,359 --> 02:32:33,640
this could be is this an environmentally

3512
02:32:31,639 --> 02:32:37,799
plastic trait or is this something

3513
02:32:33,639 --> 02:32:40,439
genetically fixed and so I gathered U

3514
02:32:37,799 --> 02:32:42,759
spores from both morphs and brought them

3515
02:32:40,439 --> 02:32:46,120
into the lab and grew them on these tiny

3516
02:32:42,760 --> 02:32:48,439
pieces of string and so they started out

3517
02:32:46,120 --> 02:32:51,079
just a couple centimeters large planted

3518
02:32:48,439 --> 02:32:53,040
them into the bottom of the ocean and 6

3519
02:32:51,079 --> 02:32:56,600
months later they had grown to be over 9

3520
02:32:53,040 --> 02:32:59,359
M tall and I was able to compare their

3521
02:32:56,600 --> 02:33:01,800
morphologies and see whether this trait

3522
02:32:59,359 --> 02:33:05,960
was actually genetically fixed or not

3523
02:33:01,799 --> 02:33:08,478
it's genetic by the way um and it turned

3524
02:33:05,959 --> 02:33:10,478
out that a lot of these methods I was

3525
02:33:08,478 --> 02:33:13,039
using happened to be borrowed from kelp

3526
02:33:10,478 --> 02:33:15,318
aquaculture this seeding the kelp onto

3527
02:33:13,040 --> 02:33:18,800
strings so that transitioned nicely to

3528
02:33:15,318 --> 02:33:20,680
my current work as a postto and also

3529
02:33:18,799 --> 02:33:22,318
this same motivation for wanting to

3530
02:33:20,680 --> 02:33:25,840
understand the relationships between

3531
02:33:22,318 --> 02:33:27,359
genotypes and phenotypes in kelp but I

3532
02:33:25,840 --> 02:33:30,079
want to back up and just talk about what

3533
02:33:27,359 --> 02:33:31,520
is seaweed um so kelp is a type of

3534
02:33:30,079 --> 02:33:33,559
seaweed but here we can see that the

3535
02:33:31,520 --> 02:33:35,880
seaweeds are a really diverse group of

3536
02:33:33,559 --> 02:33:39,600
species they come in all sorts of colors

3537
02:33:35,879 --> 02:33:41,799
and textures and sizes and they are

3538
02:33:39,600 --> 02:33:45,200
categorized as large multicellular

3539
02:33:41,799 --> 02:33:47,039
Marine algae and they are photosynthetic

3540
02:33:45,200 --> 02:33:50,479
but unlike plants they don't have any

3541
02:33:47,040 --> 02:33:53,520
roots or vascular system and we group

3542
02:33:50,478 --> 02:33:55,959
them as Reds greens and Browns based on

3543
02:33:53,520 --> 02:33:59,279
the pro predominant color pigments that

3544
02:33:55,959 --> 02:34:01,478
they have um and some examples would be

3545
02:33:59,279 --> 02:34:04,560
Nori you might be familiar with is often

3546
02:34:01,478 --> 02:34:06,318
found in sushi rolls uh green seaweed

3547
02:34:04,559 --> 02:34:09,478
example would be sea lettuce and then

3548
02:34:06,318 --> 02:34:11,318
the brown seaweeds are wakami KOMU and

3549
02:34:09,478 --> 02:34:14,119
other kelp which you might have had in

3550
02:34:11,318 --> 02:34:18,000
seaweed salad or in miso

3551
02:34:14,120 --> 02:34:20,920
soup so this is seaweed but this is also

3552
02:34:18,000 --> 02:34:22,680
seaweed we experien seaweed in a lot of

3553
02:34:20,920 --> 02:34:24,680
daily products maybe we're not always

3554
02:34:22,680 --> 02:34:26,800
aware of but there are a lot of sugar

3555
02:34:24,680 --> 02:34:28,880
extracts that we can take from seaweeds

3556
02:34:26,799 --> 02:34:32,079
that have a jelling or emulsifying or

3557
02:34:28,879 --> 02:34:35,358
thickening agent to them we find them in

3558
02:34:32,079 --> 02:34:38,520
heartburn relief medication toothpaste

3559
02:34:35,359 --> 02:34:41,000
salad dressings mac and cheese and then

3560
02:34:38,520 --> 02:34:43,960
in recent years there's also been a lot

3561
02:34:41,000 --> 02:34:46,478
of development in food products that

3562
02:34:43,959 --> 02:34:48,919
kind of don't hide the seaweed as much

3563
02:34:46,478 --> 02:34:51,318
so in many countries especially in Asia

3564
02:34:48,920 --> 02:34:53,840
seaweed has been a part of the diet for

3565
02:34:51,318 --> 02:34:56,359
thousands of years but in countries like

3566
02:34:53,840 --> 02:34:59,159
the US it's not as Pro as prominent in

3567
02:34:56,359 --> 02:35:01,040
our diets so there's been efforts to

3568
02:34:59,159 --> 02:35:03,799
sort of mainstream kelp to things we're

3569
02:35:01,040 --> 02:35:06,240
more familiar with like burgers um and

3570
02:35:03,799 --> 02:35:09,679
then also using seaweed extracts to make

3571
02:35:06,239 --> 02:35:12,318
novel materials like bioplastics or

3572
02:35:09,680 --> 02:35:14,200
fibers that can replace synthetic fibers

3573
02:35:12,318 --> 02:35:17,119
and maybe start to replace some more

3574
02:35:14,200 --> 02:35:17,120
carbon heavy

3575
02:35:17,200 --> 02:35:22,520
Industries and seaweeds also really

3576
02:35:20,159 --> 02:35:25,439
sustainable in terms of its relative

3577
02:35:22,520 --> 02:35:27,479
resource use per ton of edible protein

3578
02:35:25,439 --> 02:35:29,479
so in this figure here we're probably

3579
02:35:27,478 --> 02:35:32,519
all aware that beef is pretty resource

3580
02:35:29,478 --> 02:35:35,039
intensive in terms of land water feed

3581
02:35:32,520 --> 02:35:37,359
and greenhouse gas emissions followed by

3582
02:35:35,040 --> 02:35:39,800
pork and then poultry when you get into

3583
02:35:37,359 --> 02:35:42,920
Seafood is a little more sustainable um

3584
02:35:39,799 --> 02:35:45,039
fish and shellfish but seaweed is really

3585
02:35:42,920 --> 02:35:47,279
the only crop that has the potential to

3586
02:35:45,040 --> 02:35:49,680
be carbon neutral or even carbon

3587
02:35:47,279 --> 02:35:52,040
negative since it is taking up CO2 as

3588
02:35:49,680 --> 02:35:54,960
it's growing and it doesn't require any

3589
02:35:52,040 --> 02:35:57,560
fresh water or fertilizer or aable land

3590
02:35:54,959 --> 02:35:57,559
in order to

3591
02:35:57,959 --> 02:36:02,159
grow but okay we're not going to all

3592
02:36:00,279 --> 02:36:04,319
just eat seaweed we still have other

3593
02:36:02,159 --> 02:36:06,359
forms of Agriculture and that's okay

3594
02:36:04,318 --> 02:36:08,478
seaweed can also help reduce greenhouse

3595
02:36:06,359 --> 02:36:11,439
gas emissions in other forms of

3596
02:36:08,478 --> 02:36:14,119
Agriculture um cows we all know emit

3597
02:36:11,439 --> 02:36:16,239
methane but there's actually a type of

3598
02:36:14,120 --> 02:36:18,479
red seaweed that if you include in the

3599
02:36:16,239 --> 02:36:20,119
cow's diet due to the high bromoform

3600
02:36:18,478 --> 02:36:22,879
content of the seaweed actually can

3601
02:36:20,120 --> 02:36:23,640
reduce the methane output of cows by 60

3602
02:36:22,879 --> 02:36:26,278
to

3603
02:36:23,639 --> 02:36:29,199
80% um in addition we can just use

3604
02:36:26,279 --> 02:36:30,880
seaweed as animal feed to have a lower

3605
02:36:29,200 --> 02:36:33,560
carbon footprint than some of these

3606
02:36:30,879 --> 02:36:36,318
other more common crops used for feed

3607
02:36:33,559 --> 02:36:38,478
like corn and

3608
02:36:36,318 --> 02:36:40,559
soybean and if we can figure out how to

3609
02:36:38,478 --> 02:36:42,879
grow seaweed at really large scales we

3610
02:36:40,559 --> 02:36:45,278
can start to tackle some larger issues

3611
02:36:42,879 --> 02:36:48,358
like carbon do oide

3612
02:36:45,279 --> 02:36:50,439
equestra so as the kelp is growing um

3613
02:36:48,359 --> 02:36:53,720
it's taking up CO2 like any other

3614
02:36:50,439 --> 02:36:56,720
photosyn photosynthesizing organism and

3615
02:36:53,719 --> 02:36:59,639
then sometimes those kelp FRS may get

3616
02:36:56,719 --> 02:37:01,519
detached say during a storm or bits of

3617
02:36:59,639 --> 02:37:03,358
detritus are just lofing off all the

3618
02:37:01,520 --> 02:37:05,640
time and that material eventually makes

3619
02:37:03,359 --> 02:37:07,279
its way down into the deep ocean where

3620
02:37:05,639 --> 02:37:10,119
there's really not a lot of metabolic

3621
02:37:07,279 --> 02:37:12,600
activity going on so that carbon just

3622
02:37:10,120 --> 02:37:14,279
sits there and degrades very slowly and

3623
02:37:12,600 --> 02:37:16,840
is essentially sequestered for

3624
02:37:14,279 --> 02:37:19,159
potentially hundreds of years so there's

3625
02:37:16,840 --> 02:37:22,318
some thoughts out there that maybe we

3626
02:37:19,159 --> 02:37:24,398
could Farm a whole bunch of seaweed suck

3627
02:37:22,318 --> 02:37:26,318
out a bunch of CO2 from the atmosphere

3628
02:37:24,398 --> 02:37:29,199
and then dump it to the bottom of the

3629
02:37:26,318 --> 02:37:30,559
ocean um just to give you a sense of the

3630
02:37:29,200 --> 02:37:33,279
kind of scale that we would need to have

3631
02:37:30,559 --> 02:37:36,119
a really sizable impact on co2

3632
02:37:33,279 --> 02:37:38,319
sequestration to sequester one gigon of

3633
02:37:36,120 --> 02:37:42,439
carbon per year we would need about

3634
02:37:38,318 --> 02:37:44,398
730,000 square kilometers of seaweed

3635
02:37:42,439 --> 02:37:46,880
right now the total area of all the

3636
02:37:44,398 --> 02:37:49,039
world's seaweeds Farms amounts to just

3637
02:37:46,879 --> 02:37:51,159
2,000 square kmers so we' really need

3638
02:37:49,040 --> 02:37:53,439
quite a lot of seaweed and then there's

3639
02:37:51,159 --> 02:37:56,318
also the question of what to do with

3640
02:37:53,439 --> 02:37:58,439
this seaweed um to sequester the carbon

3641
02:37:56,318 --> 02:38:00,439
there's some potential concerns about

3642
02:37:58,439 --> 02:38:01,800
sinking this huge amount of biomass to

3643
02:38:00,439 --> 02:38:03,960
the bottom of the ocean what are the

3644
02:38:01,799 --> 02:38:06,119
ecological effects of doing that where

3645
02:38:03,959 --> 02:38:08,159
there's not normally this huge influx of

3646
02:38:06,120 --> 02:38:10,240
carbon all at once and it's also kind of

3647
02:38:08,159 --> 02:38:11,799
a waste because we Farm all this seaweed

3648
02:38:10,239 --> 02:38:13,760
we could turn it into something like

3649
02:38:11,799 --> 02:38:15,840
construction bricks for buildings that

3650
02:38:13,760 --> 02:38:17,200
could maybe hold that carbon in uh

3651
02:38:15,840 --> 02:38:19,960
buildings that are going to last for a

3652
02:38:17,200 --> 02:38:21,600
long time

3653
02:38:19,959 --> 02:38:24,719
so where does seaweed farming occur

3654
02:38:21,600 --> 02:38:27,079
around the world um over 95% of seaweed

3655
02:38:24,719 --> 02:38:29,398
farming is happening in Asia primarily

3656
02:38:27,079 --> 02:38:31,799
China and Indonesia but there's also a

3657
02:38:29,398 --> 02:38:34,079
lot of other countries with high

3658
02:38:31,799 --> 02:38:37,199
exclusive economic zones which are the

3659
02:38:34,079 --> 02:38:39,840
bright blue color there um including the

3660
02:38:37,200 --> 02:38:42,120
US so there's plenty of more ocean space

3661
02:38:39,840 --> 02:38:44,520
where we could potentially be expanding

3662
02:38:42,120 --> 02:38:46,079
seaweed and seaweed farming is actually

3663
02:38:44,520 --> 02:38:48,239
the fastest growing sector of

3664
02:38:46,079 --> 02:38:49,879
aquaculture and it can look different in

3665
02:38:48,239 --> 02:38:53,119
different places around the world World

3666
02:38:49,879 --> 02:38:55,278
depending on the species resources so

3667
02:38:53,120 --> 02:38:58,120
sometimes you might have red seaweed

3668
02:38:55,279 --> 02:39:01,040
growing um kind of in Shallow Nearshore

3669
02:38:58,120 --> 02:39:04,079
Waters here you might have really large

3670
02:39:01,040 --> 02:39:06,760
scale red seaweed Farms um some smaller

3671
02:39:04,079 --> 02:39:11,200
scale ones in pharoh islands and in

3672
02:39:06,760 --> 02:39:13,760
Maine um and in the US the major States

3673
02:39:11,200 --> 02:39:15,880
involved in kelp farming are Maine and

3674
02:39:13,760 --> 02:39:18,800
Alaska and this species here the sugar

3675
02:39:15,879 --> 02:39:20,879
kelp is the most commonly farmed species

3676
02:39:18,799 --> 02:39:23,559
and is going to be the star of the rest

3677
02:39:20,879 --> 02:39:25,959
of the talk today so a lot of great

3678
02:39:23,559 --> 02:39:27,719
products can be derived from sugar kelp

3679
02:39:25,959 --> 02:39:28,799
again with those sugar extracts for

3680
02:39:27,719 --> 02:39:32,438
example

3681
02:39:28,799 --> 02:39:34,358
alginate um depending on the particular

3682
02:39:32,439 --> 02:39:36,760
species and actually where the kelp is

3683
02:39:34,359 --> 02:39:39,159
grown you get different compositions of

3684
02:39:36,760 --> 02:39:41,639
these sugars and that can lead to either

3685
02:39:39,159 --> 02:39:43,920
more rigid or more elastic gels that can

3686
02:39:41,639 --> 02:39:46,199
be used in different products like

3687
02:39:43,920 --> 02:39:48,920
Pharmaceuticals um the kelp can just be

3688
02:39:46,200 --> 02:39:51,399
eaten straight as food um might want to

3689
02:39:48,920 --> 02:39:53,439
boil it down a bit so it's not so chewy

3690
02:39:51,398 --> 02:39:55,439
and then supplements like iodine are

3691
02:39:53,439 --> 02:39:57,079
really popular coming from kelp

3692
02:39:55,439 --> 02:39:59,639
biomedical materials like wound

3693
02:39:57,079 --> 02:40:01,639
dressings and dental molds and then

3694
02:39:59,639 --> 02:40:04,079
again as a gel or thickener for

3695
02:40:01,639 --> 02:40:06,079
cosmetics and food and because of its

3696
02:40:04,079 --> 02:40:08,680
high nitrogen content can also be a

3697
02:40:06,079 --> 02:40:11,600
really great fertilizer and even

3698
02:40:08,680 --> 02:40:13,920
potentially extracting biofuel um sugar

3699
02:40:11,600 --> 02:40:16,479
kelp gets its name actually from the

3700
02:40:13,920 --> 02:40:20,559
high content of the sugar alcohol called

3701
02:40:16,478 --> 02:40:23,438
manitol which can be converted into bi B

3702
02:40:20,559 --> 02:40:26,199
fuels and we really do need a lot of

3703
02:40:23,439 --> 02:40:28,720
innovative products to help mitigate

3704
02:40:26,200 --> 02:40:31,040
effects of climate change if you were on

3705
02:40:28,719 --> 02:40:34,199
Earth last year you experienced the

3706
02:40:31,040 --> 02:40:35,399
warmest year in recorded history and

3707
02:40:34,200 --> 02:40:38,399
it's probably going to change at the end

3708
02:40:35,398 --> 02:40:41,358
of this year this is a map of the global

3709
02:40:38,398 --> 02:40:44,199
temperature anomalies from last summer

3710
02:40:41,359 --> 02:40:46,880
and overlaying here the sugar kelp wild

3711
02:40:44,200 --> 02:40:48,680
distribution happens to be in a lot of

3712
02:40:46,879 --> 02:40:50,000
these hot spots that are warming up

3713
02:40:48,680 --> 02:40:52,479
pretty rapid

3714
02:40:50,000 --> 02:40:54,920
especially in the Northeast us where we

3715
02:40:52,478 --> 02:40:58,000
have a lot of our wild sugar kelp

3716
02:40:54,920 --> 02:41:00,398
populations so sugar kelp is a cold

3717
02:40:58,000 --> 02:41:02,760
loving temperate species they really

3718
02:41:00,398 --> 02:41:05,599
start to degrade above temperatures of

3719
02:41:02,760 --> 02:41:08,359
20 21 degrees

3720
02:41:05,600 --> 02:41:10,720
C so warming waters are threatening

3721
02:41:08,359 --> 02:41:12,359
sugar cup aquaculture it's increasing

3722
02:41:10,719 --> 02:41:14,879
the vulnerability of those wild

3723
02:41:12,359 --> 02:41:17,439
populations which are the seed source

3724
02:41:14,879 --> 02:41:20,679
essentially for our farmed kelp it also

3725
02:41:17,439 --> 02:41:22,479
shortens the growing season for um for

3726
02:41:20,680 --> 02:41:24,159
growing kelp it limits the time that you

3727
02:41:22,478 --> 02:41:26,559
can plant the kelp because you may have

3728
02:41:24,159 --> 02:41:28,478
to start waiting later into the fall

3729
02:41:26,559 --> 02:41:30,398
where it's cold enough to plant and you

3730
02:41:28,478 --> 02:41:33,318
have to start harvesting earlier in the

3731
02:41:30,398 --> 02:41:35,879
spring before it gets too warm again so

3732
02:41:33,318 --> 02:41:37,959
this is going to result in lower yields

3733
02:41:35,879 --> 02:41:41,879
and then warming also is restricting the

3734
02:41:37,959 --> 02:41:41,879
latitudes where we can actually Farm

3735
02:41:42,279 --> 02:41:47,479
kelp luckily there is substantial

3736
02:41:45,000 --> 02:41:49,359
genetic diversity among our sugar Kel

3737
02:41:47,478 --> 02:41:51,159
populations and so our lab at would

3738
02:41:49,359 --> 02:41:53,680
whole works primarily with these

3739
02:41:51,159 --> 02:41:56,719
Northeastern populations from Maine down

3740
02:41:53,680 --> 02:41:58,559
to New York and so since there's this

3741
02:41:56,719 --> 02:42:00,639
genetic diversity it's likely that there

3742
02:41:58,559 --> 02:42:03,879
are already some individuals out there

3743
02:42:00,639 --> 02:42:06,079
that have adaptations to cope with heat

3744
02:42:03,879 --> 02:42:08,199
and so in this figure the different

3745
02:42:06,079 --> 02:42:10,799
colors represent different ancestry

3746
02:42:08,200 --> 02:42:13,439
groupings and each horizontal bar

3747
02:42:10,799 --> 02:42:16,358
represents a different individual in

3748
02:42:13,439 --> 02:42:18,520
these different populations so if we can

3749
02:42:16,359 --> 02:42:20,520
identify the individuals that have these

3750
02:42:18,520 --> 02:42:22,760
adaptations to cope with heat and look

3751
02:42:20,520 --> 02:42:26,880
at the genes involved then we can really

3752
02:42:22,760 --> 02:42:26,880
start breeding for heat tolerant

3753
02:42:27,040 --> 02:42:31,040
kelp so before I get into how we do the

3754
02:42:29,359 --> 02:42:32,239
breeding let talk about the life cycle

3755
02:42:31,040 --> 02:42:33,960
and I'm glad we've already been talking

3756
02:42:32,239 --> 02:42:38,398
about spores and such that's going to be

3757
02:42:33,959 --> 02:42:40,119
helpful so what we do in our lab to um

3758
02:42:38,398 --> 02:42:42,680
to grow to breed the kelp is we'll

3759
02:42:40,120 --> 02:42:45,560
collect the adult sporify which is what

3760
02:42:42,680 --> 02:42:48,200
we see growing out in the wild and then

3761
02:42:45,559 --> 02:42:50,719
usually running down the center of the

3762
02:42:48,200 --> 02:42:52,439
sporify is kind of like a darkened band

3763
02:42:50,719 --> 02:42:55,278
and that's the sorus tissue that's where

3764
02:42:52,439 --> 02:42:56,960
all the spores are kept so we can bring

3765
02:42:55,279 --> 02:42:59,120
that back to the lab and pretty easily

3766
02:42:56,959 --> 02:43:01,559
just release the spores cut out a little

3767
02:42:59,120 --> 02:43:03,160
piece of the sorus that's enough stress

3768
02:43:01,559 --> 02:43:06,879
to make it want to release all its

3769
02:43:03,159 --> 02:43:08,398
spores um and then the gapy is the next

3770
02:43:06,879 --> 02:43:10,799
life stage that grows out of the spores

3771
02:43:08,398 --> 02:43:13,358
so we have male and female gyes that

3772
02:43:10,799 --> 02:43:15,079
which can come from a single sporify and

3773
02:43:13,359 --> 02:43:17,479
then under the right conditions those

3774
02:43:15,079 --> 02:43:19,559
will release their gametes and fertilize

3775
02:43:17,478 --> 02:43:22,398
egg which then develop into the Juvenile

3776
02:43:19,559 --> 02:43:25,799
sporify and ultimately the adult sporify

3777
02:43:22,398 --> 02:43:28,639
so in order to do breeding in the lab we

3778
02:43:25,799 --> 02:43:30,879
start by isolating a single gapy put it

3779
02:43:28,639 --> 02:43:33,358
in a flask of sea water over time it

3780
02:43:30,879 --> 02:43:35,239
grows into this kind of pom pom and then

3781
02:43:33,359 --> 02:43:37,159
we're able to fractionate that up into

3782
02:43:35,239 --> 02:43:39,159
little fragments and eventually those

3783
02:43:37,159 --> 02:43:41,559
grow we fractionate more and we end up

3784
02:43:39,159 --> 02:43:44,680
with all this biomass of fragments all

3785
02:43:41,559 --> 02:43:46,799
of the same genotype so in our lab at

3786
02:43:44,680 --> 02:43:49,200
Woods Hole we have a collection of

3787
02:43:46,799 --> 02:43:51,679
hundreds of these strains all originated

3788
02:43:49,200 --> 02:43:53,640
from single gyes so when we want to do a

3789
02:43:51,680 --> 02:43:56,639
cross we can just take a scoop of this

3790
02:43:53,639 --> 02:44:00,959
male gapy a scoop of that female gapy

3791
02:43:56,639 --> 02:44:00,959
throw them together and they produce

3792
02:44:01,200 --> 02:44:06,079
sporophytes so that process in a bit

3793
02:44:03,639 --> 02:44:08,199
more detail once we have thrown the

3794
02:44:06,079 --> 02:44:10,200
gametophytes together and they have

3795
02:44:08,200 --> 02:44:12,760
little microscopic beginnings of

3796
02:44:10,200 --> 02:44:16,000
sporophytes we actually filter that

3797
02:44:12,760 --> 02:44:18,800
material down and then take a paintbrush

3798
02:44:16,000 --> 02:44:21,239
calligraphy brush and paint that onto

3799
02:44:18,799 --> 02:44:23,719
the spools of uh

3800
02:44:21,239 --> 02:44:26,079
string then once those have a little

3801
02:44:23,719 --> 02:44:27,920
more time to grow in the lab we bring

3802
02:44:26,079 --> 02:44:31,318
them out into the ocean where we wrap

3803
02:44:27,920 --> 02:44:34,600
them around a larger a thicker grow line

3804
02:44:31,318 --> 02:44:37,119
and so the T lines are just sitting out

3805
02:44:34,600 --> 02:44:37,880
um about six feet below the surface of

3806
02:44:37,120 --> 02:44:40,680
the

3807
02:44:37,879 --> 02:44:42,478
water and then uh we deploy them in

3808
02:44:40,680 --> 02:44:45,159
Autumn and then about six months later

3809
02:44:42,478 --> 02:44:47,159
in Spring we harvest the kelp up onto a

3810
02:44:45,159 --> 02:44:49,680
boat and it's quite heavy so we need

3811
02:44:47,159 --> 02:44:51,039
some extra uh equipment to haul that

3812
02:44:49,680 --> 02:44:53,439
onto

3813
02:44:51,040 --> 02:44:55,120
land and then we come back to the lab

3814
02:44:53,439 --> 02:44:57,639
and we take a bunch of measurements to

3815
02:44:55,120 --> 02:45:00,000
see which genotypes led to which kind of

3816
02:44:57,639 --> 02:45:03,318
phenotypes and we do see a pretty wide

3817
02:45:00,000 --> 02:45:06,159
variety in yield in length of blades in

3818
02:45:03,318 --> 02:45:09,079
density of blades all just from um

3819
02:45:06,159 --> 02:45:11,200
crossing different uh gites and these

3820
02:45:09,079 --> 02:45:13,318
were all grown within the same Farm a

3821
02:45:11,200 --> 02:45:17,120
pretty small area about 400 square

3822
02:45:13,318 --> 02:45:20,199
meters so we do see quite a bit of

3823
02:45:17,120 --> 02:45:23,640
diversity so mostly the lab um has been

3824
02:45:20,200 --> 02:45:27,560
working on Pro uh breeding for high

3825
02:45:23,639 --> 02:45:29,879
yield um kelp but we're also interested

3826
02:45:27,559 --> 02:45:33,000
is breeding for other traits like heat

3827
02:45:29,879 --> 02:45:35,559
tolerance so our goal is to really breed

3828
02:45:33,000 --> 02:45:39,478
more heat tolerant kelp to increase

3829
02:45:35,559 --> 02:45:42,199
resiliency in the industry to expand um

3830
02:45:39,478 --> 02:45:44,039
farming to lower latitudes and extend

3831
02:45:42,200 --> 02:45:46,880
the growing season for kelp where it's

3832
02:45:44,040 --> 02:45:49,040
already being grown so the way we've

3833
02:45:46,879 --> 02:45:51,239
gone about doing this is to start with

3834
02:45:49,040 --> 02:45:53,680
the gapy stage so we have our big

3835
02:45:51,239 --> 02:45:57,318
collection of gyes we first want to

3836
02:45:53,680 --> 02:46:00,880
assess heat stress tolerance in these

3837
02:45:57,318 --> 02:46:03,159
gyes then the idea is to cross um from

3838
02:46:00,879 --> 02:46:05,438
that heat stress experiment identify

3839
02:46:03,159 --> 02:46:07,478
gyes that we think are heat tolerant and

3840
02:46:05,439 --> 02:46:09,479
ones that we think are not heat tolerant

3841
02:46:07,478 --> 02:46:11,438
and make crosses within each of those

3842
02:46:09,478 --> 02:46:13,679
groups and then grow them up into

3843
02:46:11,439 --> 02:46:16,040
sporify and see whether our predictions

3844
02:46:13,680 --> 02:46:17,880
at the gapy stage hold true at the

3845
02:46:16,040 --> 02:46:20,120
sporify stage because ultimately what

3846
02:46:17,879 --> 02:46:22,438
we're interested in is whether the

3847
02:46:20,120 --> 02:46:24,560
sporophytes are heat tolerant um but if

3848
02:46:22,439 --> 02:46:26,960
we can predict that sporify heat

3849
02:46:24,559 --> 02:46:28,760
tolerance from the gapy stage that's

3850
02:46:26,959 --> 02:46:30,119
going to really help Advance us in our

3851
02:46:28,760 --> 02:46:32,439
breeding

3852
02:46:30,120 --> 02:46:35,279
process so I'll start by talking about

3853
02:46:32,439 --> 02:46:38,159
the gapy heat stress

3854
02:46:35,279 --> 02:46:41,279
testing so we conducted this experiment

3855
02:46:38,159 --> 02:46:44,959
in little tabletop incubators um putting

3856
02:46:41,279 --> 02:46:47,079
the gites in these 96 W plates and I had

3857
02:46:44,959 --> 02:46:49,398
three temperature treatments in three

3858
02:46:47,079 --> 02:46:51,799
different incubators so the first is the

3859
02:46:49,398 --> 02:46:53,959
12° Celsius that's their control

3860
02:46:51,799 --> 02:46:58,039
conditions that's where they're happiest

3861
02:46:53,959 --> 02:47:00,719
and then 20° and 24° represent current

3862
02:46:58,040 --> 02:47:02,479
anomaly temperatures and future expected

3863
02:47:00,719 --> 02:47:04,559
temperatures for the Gulf of Baine

3864
02:47:02,478 --> 02:47:06,920
region where most of these gites

3865
02:47:04,559 --> 02:47:10,600
originated

3866
02:47:06,920 --> 02:47:13,600
from so in each temperature we had 93

3867
02:47:10,600 --> 02:47:15,559
genetically distinct gyes that we plated

3868
02:47:13,600 --> 02:47:18,399
out with three replicates into each of

3869
02:47:15,559 --> 02:47:20,359
the in Wells in the 96v plate and this

3870
02:47:18,398 --> 02:47:22,239
is an example of what it would look like

3871
02:47:20,359 --> 02:47:25,359
inside one of those Wells a bunch of

3872
02:47:22,239 --> 02:47:28,119
little fragments all of the same

3873
02:47:25,359 --> 02:47:30,640
genotype so we ran this experiment over

3874
02:47:28,120 --> 02:47:32,880
a few weeks and what we were measuring

3875
02:47:30,639 --> 02:47:35,840
was photosystem functioning via

3876
02:47:32,879 --> 02:47:38,239
chlorophyll a fluorescence so probably

3877
02:47:35,840 --> 02:47:42,559
folks here are familiar with chlorophyll

3878
02:47:38,239 --> 02:47:45,559
a that mostly absorbs around uh 684

3879
02:47:42,559 --> 02:47:48,398
nanometers wavelength so we used a plate

3880
02:47:45,559 --> 02:47:51,318
reading spectrometer to put our 90

3881
02:47:48,398 --> 02:47:53,799
plates into there and measured the

3882
02:47:51,318 --> 02:47:56,840
change and fluoresence of each well over

3883
02:47:53,799 --> 02:47:58,519
time so if we have a really healthy set

3884
02:47:56,840 --> 02:48:00,760
of gamify fragments that are all

3885
02:47:58,520 --> 02:48:03,120
fluorescing and we see high fluoresence

3886
02:48:00,760 --> 02:48:05,880
intensity we know that there's a lot of

3887
02:48:03,120 --> 02:48:07,720
live cells there if we see very low

3888
02:48:05,879 --> 02:48:09,839
fluorescence intensity we know that

3889
02:48:07,719 --> 02:48:12,079
there are very few live cells in that

3890
02:48:09,840 --> 02:48:16,600
well so this is how we kind of tracked

3891
02:48:12,079 --> 02:48:16,600
survival and health of the gyes over

3892
02:48:16,680 --> 02:48:20,960
time so let's see what happened with

3893
02:48:19,000 --> 02:48:24,439
their photosynthetic performance we

3894
02:48:20,959 --> 02:48:26,799
started all the incubators at 12° C

3895
02:48:24,439 --> 02:48:29,279
gradually ramped them up to their final

3896
02:48:26,799 --> 02:48:32,639
temperatures and then um held them at

3897
02:48:29,279 --> 02:48:35,239
those temperatures for two weeks so the

3898
02:48:32,639 --> 02:48:37,398
y axis there is the mean fluorescence

3899
02:48:35,239 --> 02:48:41,039
intensity and these are averages for all

3900
02:48:37,398 --> 02:48:43,239
93 gyes in each treatment and we see

3901
02:48:41,040 --> 02:48:45,040
that um in the control there was maybe a

3902
02:48:43,239 --> 02:48:46,680
little bit of decline in fluoresence

3903
02:48:45,040 --> 02:48:49,680
intensity they probably didn't love

3904
02:48:46,680 --> 02:48:52,040
living in a 96 well plate we saw a much

3905
02:48:49,680 --> 02:48:55,359
greater decline in the 20c and

3906
02:48:52,040 --> 02:48:57,240
especially the 24c treatment so the heat

3907
02:48:55,359 --> 02:48:59,200
was definitely having a negative effect

3908
02:48:57,239 --> 02:49:01,840
on survival of the

3909
02:48:59,200 --> 02:49:04,439
gites but there was actually quite a lot

3910
02:49:01,840 --> 02:49:07,040
of individual variation so if we look

3911
02:49:04,439 --> 02:49:09,239
now at the um change in fluorescence

3912
02:49:07,040 --> 02:49:12,120
from the beginning to the end of the

3913
02:49:09,239 --> 02:49:14,840
two- we heat treatment um we're looking

3914
02:49:12,120 --> 02:49:17,920
at the percent change in fluorescence

3915
02:49:14,840 --> 02:49:20,000
over that time for each individual gapy

3916
02:49:17,920 --> 02:49:22,478
and again they had three re replicates

3917
02:49:20,000 --> 02:49:25,478
so we can see that uh we span from some

3918
02:49:22,478 --> 02:49:27,559
gyes that declined Almost 100% so

3919
02:49:25,478 --> 02:49:30,478
basically fully dead and others that

3920
02:49:27,559 --> 02:49:32,199
declined zero or even had a positive um

3921
02:49:30,478 --> 02:49:36,840
increase in fluorescence so we're really

3922
02:49:32,200 --> 02:49:39,840
seeing a wide array of heat tolerances

3923
02:49:36,840 --> 02:49:41,799
here and we had thought that maybe since

3924
02:49:39,840 --> 02:49:44,439
we collect from these two different

3925
02:49:41,799 --> 02:49:47,039
regions um Gulf of Maine and Southern

3926
02:49:44,439 --> 02:49:49,479
New England there's um previous rech

3927
02:49:47,040 --> 02:49:51,800
research shows genetic an a genetic

3928
02:49:49,478 --> 02:49:54,119
break here so we thought that maybe the

3929
02:49:51,799 --> 02:49:56,119
southern New England kelp would have

3930
02:49:54,120 --> 02:49:58,680
already some more heat tolerance

3931
02:49:56,120 --> 02:50:01,040
adaptation since they maybe experienc

3932
02:49:58,680 --> 02:50:02,920
warmer temperatures than Gulf of Maine

3933
02:50:01,040 --> 02:50:05,279
but interestingly we didn't see any

3934
02:50:02,920 --> 02:50:08,120
difference in the percent change in

3935
02:50:05,279 --> 02:50:10,079
fluoresence between these two groups so

3936
02:50:08,120 --> 02:50:11,399
really came down to just a lot of

3937
02:50:10,079 --> 02:50:13,680
individual

3938
02:50:11,398 --> 02:50:16,439
variation and we were able to do a

3939
02:50:13,680 --> 02:50:19,120
preliminary genomewide association study

3940
02:50:16,439 --> 02:50:21,800
based on that variation we had had over

3941
02:50:19,120 --> 02:50:24,200
900,000 Snips which are here on the

3942
02:50:21,799 --> 02:50:25,559
x-axis we have scaffolds not chromosomes

3943
02:50:24,200 --> 02:50:29,000
which is why this axis looks kind of

3944
02:50:25,559 --> 02:50:31,318
crazy and then the y- axis is the

3945
02:50:29,000 --> 02:50:33,879
relationship or the significance of the

3946
02:50:31,318 --> 02:50:38,000
relationship between each of those low

3947
02:50:33,879 --> 02:50:40,358
side and the heat stress response um so

3948
02:50:38,000 --> 02:50:43,359
we have not a ton of super significant

3949
02:50:40,359 --> 02:50:45,359
Snips but we do see uh a couple Peaks

3950
02:50:43,359 --> 02:50:47,760
here where there are a lot of snips all

3951
02:50:45,359 --> 02:50:50,399
in the same general region so maybe this

3952
02:50:47,760 --> 02:50:52,559
would be uh point that an area that we

3953
02:50:50,398 --> 02:50:54,959
want to investigate further to see if

3954
02:50:52,559 --> 02:50:56,719
there are any genes maybe coding for

3955
02:50:54,959 --> 02:50:59,000
proteins that could be related for heat

3956
02:50:56,719 --> 02:51:00,679
tolerance we're currently working on

3957
02:50:59,000 --> 02:51:03,840
that right

3958
02:51:00,680 --> 02:51:05,920
now okay so I want to talk about the

3959
02:51:03,840 --> 02:51:07,760
next stage in this process so we

3960
02:51:05,920 --> 02:51:10,120
assessed heat stress tolerance in the

3961
02:51:07,760 --> 02:51:13,120
gametophytes now we're going to see how

3962
02:51:10,120 --> 02:51:16,439
did our predictions go and are they

3963
02:51:13,120 --> 02:51:18,000
related to the sporify stage um while it

3964
02:51:16,439 --> 02:51:20,880
would be really nice to test this on

3965
02:51:18,000 --> 02:51:23,559
adult spor aites since uh we didn't want

3966
02:51:20,879 --> 02:51:25,879
to wait that long we used juvenile

3967
02:51:23,559 --> 02:51:28,519
sporophytes but we actually did also

3968
02:51:25,879 --> 02:51:30,639
plant these crosses out to the ocean and

3969
02:51:28,520 --> 02:51:33,000
we'll be harvesting them in a couple of

3970
02:51:30,639 --> 02:51:35,639
months so we'll be able to look at

3971
02:51:33,000 --> 02:51:36,398
juvenile to adult sporify relationship

3972
02:51:35,639 --> 02:51:39,119
as

3973
02:51:36,398 --> 02:51:41,959
well okay so taking what we learned from

3974
02:51:39,120 --> 02:51:45,160
the gapy heat stress response we wanted

3975
02:51:41,959 --> 02:51:49,278
to grab males and females from the top

3976
02:51:45,159 --> 02:51:51,398
tolerant and the lower less tolerant

3977
02:51:49,279 --> 02:51:53,120
and so we made five crosses that we

3978
02:51:51,398 --> 02:51:55,599
predicted would be tolerant and five

3979
02:51:53,120 --> 02:51:58,040
that we predicted would be intolerant

3980
02:51:55,600 --> 02:52:00,559
but interestingly kind of similar to the

3981
02:51:58,040 --> 02:52:03,080
mushrooms sometimes certain gyes just

3982
02:52:00,559 --> 02:52:05,359
aren't compatible and so we ended up

3983
02:52:03,079 --> 02:52:07,719
with were're three tolerant crosses that

3984
02:52:05,359 --> 02:52:09,600
produce bites and four intolerant

3985
02:52:07,719 --> 02:52:12,318
crosses that produce

3986
02:52:09,600 --> 02:52:14,640
bites so how we did this was again

3987
02:52:12,318 --> 02:52:16,039
taking that material painting it onto

3988
02:52:14,639 --> 02:52:18,959
strings which we've wrapped around

3989
02:52:16,040 --> 02:52:21,520
microscope slides here and then um gave

3990
02:52:18,959 --> 02:52:22,919
them about four to five weeks to grow

3991
02:52:21,520 --> 02:52:25,359
when the spor fites were about a

3992
02:52:22,920 --> 02:52:27,960
centimeter large we plucked them off

3993
02:52:25,359 --> 02:52:28,960
from each cross and put each one into a

3994
02:52:27,959 --> 02:52:32,358
test

3995
02:52:28,959 --> 02:52:35,478
tube and then we had an experiment in

3996
02:52:32,359 --> 02:52:37,399
these incubators here so the the

3997
02:52:35,478 --> 02:52:39,799
juvenile sporophytes were all in test

3998
02:52:37,398 --> 02:52:42,000
tubes and we had two incubators at two

3999
02:52:39,799 --> 02:52:45,119
different treatments one again control

4000
02:52:42,000 --> 02:52:47,680
at 12 and a a heat treatment that was

4001
02:52:45,120 --> 02:52:50,040
gradually warming up to 22 degrees

4002
02:52:47,680 --> 02:52:52,880
Celsius we wanted to be sure to do a

4003
02:52:50,040 --> 02:52:54,720
gradual warming so as not to uh heat

4004
02:52:52,879 --> 02:52:56,519
shock the sporophytes and have them just

4005
02:52:54,719 --> 02:52:59,519
all die because we do want to see which

4006
02:52:56,520 --> 02:53:01,238
ones are tolerant and which are not so

4007
02:52:59,520 --> 02:53:04,720
in each treatment we had our seven

4008
02:53:01,238 --> 02:53:06,719
crosses three tolerant four intolerant

4009
02:53:04,719 --> 02:53:09,559
and six replicate Blades of six test

4010
02:53:06,719 --> 02:53:09,559
tubes for each

4011
02:53:09,600 --> 02:53:15,760
cross and then in order to analy how

4012
02:53:13,600 --> 02:53:17,840
these sporophytes were either tolerating

4013
02:53:15,760 --> 02:53:20,040
or not tolerating the heat we took

4014
02:53:17,840 --> 02:53:22,200
photos at three different time points so

4015
02:53:20,040 --> 02:53:24,000
first at the beginning of the experiment

4016
02:53:22,200 --> 02:53:26,920
then about two weeks in when the heat

4017
02:53:24,000 --> 02:53:28,920
treatment had reached 20° and then about

4018
02:53:26,920 --> 02:53:30,879
3 weeks in when the heat treatment had

4019
02:53:28,920 --> 02:53:33,520
reached

4020
02:53:30,879 --> 02:53:36,639
22° and the main metrics we were looking

4021
02:53:33,520 --> 02:53:38,399
at were the total area and then also the

4022
02:53:36,639 --> 02:53:41,039
healthy area which was calculated from

4023
02:53:38,398 --> 02:53:42,879
the percent healthy tissue so we took

4024
02:53:41,040 --> 02:53:45,720
these images and analyzed them in image

4025
02:53:42,879 --> 02:53:47,318
J to get the total area and then we

4026
02:53:45,719 --> 02:53:50,358
created an algorithm that would

4027
02:53:47,318 --> 02:53:53,278
characterize each pixel in the blade as

4028
02:53:50,359 --> 02:53:55,680
either healthy or degraded based on how

4029
02:53:53,279 --> 02:53:57,720
much blue light was being absorbed or

4030
02:53:55,680 --> 02:54:01,159
not so these images were taken over a

4031
02:53:57,719 --> 02:54:03,199
back lit surface and we said that if uh

4032
02:54:01,159 --> 02:54:04,879
more than 50% of the blue light was

4033
02:54:03,200 --> 02:54:06,720
coming through that means there wasn't a

4034
02:54:04,879 --> 02:54:10,119
lot of chlorophyll there so that's a

4035
02:54:06,719 --> 02:54:11,358
degraded tissue area if uh less than 50%

4036
02:54:10,120 --> 02:54:13,359
of the blue light was coming through and

4037
02:54:11,359 --> 02:54:16,399
was being absorbed then we know that was

4038
02:54:13,359 --> 02:54:19,439
healthy tissue so for example algorithm

4039
02:54:16,398 --> 02:54:22,760
told us this blade was 97% % healthy and

4040
02:54:19,439 --> 02:54:25,159
this blade was 36% healthy and from

4041
02:54:22,760 --> 02:54:28,040
there we just multiply by total area to

4042
02:54:25,159 --> 02:54:28,039
get the healthy

4043
02:54:29,120 --> 02:54:34,800
area so let's take a look first at

4044
02:54:31,760 --> 02:54:37,760
individual cross variation for total

4045
02:54:34,799 --> 02:54:39,840
area so we can see that in the heat

4046
02:54:37,760 --> 02:54:44,079
treatment most of the

4047
02:54:39,840 --> 02:54:45,719
growth oh boy most of the growth was

4048
02:54:44,079 --> 02:54:49,120
happening

4049
02:54:45,719 --> 02:54:50,840
sorry um over this first time period

4050
02:54:49,120 --> 02:54:53,359
um and then they were sort of just

4051
02:54:50,840 --> 02:54:55,520
maintaining the um area that they had

4052
02:54:53,359 --> 02:54:57,200
amassed whereas in the control treatment

4053
02:54:55,520 --> 02:54:58,920
we saw more of a steady increase

4054
02:54:57,200 --> 02:55:01,159
throughout the duration of the

4055
02:54:58,920 --> 02:55:04,040
experiment um and a kind of similar

4056
02:55:01,159 --> 02:55:06,200
Trend with the healthy tissue um

4057
02:55:04,040 --> 02:55:08,439
although some individuals in control

4058
02:55:06,200 --> 02:55:10,920
were also losing a little bit of healthy

4059
02:55:08,439 --> 02:55:13,479
tissue in that time but so really most

4060
02:55:10,920 --> 02:55:16,159
of the growth and growth of healthy

4061
02:55:13,478 --> 02:55:18,318
tissue happened in that first up to 20

4062
02:55:16,159 --> 02:55:20,600
degrees and then more just maintenance

4063
02:55:18,318 --> 02:55:23,039
up to

4064
02:55:20,600 --> 02:55:25,279
22° so now let's see what happens if we

4065
02:55:23,040 --> 02:55:28,640
group them by their prediction

4066
02:55:25,279 --> 02:55:31,600
categories so we can clearly see that

4067
02:55:28,639 --> 02:55:34,840
the left graph here is the mean percent

4068
02:55:31,600 --> 02:55:38,720
change in total area from the beginning

4069
02:55:34,840 --> 02:55:40,840
to the 20c Mark um we see that the

4070
02:55:38,719 --> 02:55:43,559
predicted tolerant groups for the darker

4071
02:55:40,840 --> 02:55:45,520
bars had a much greater percent change

4072
02:55:43,559 --> 02:55:48,318
in area compared to the predicted

4073
02:55:45,520 --> 02:55:51,319
intolerant group and a similar story for

4074
02:55:48,318 --> 02:55:54,318
% change of healthy area we see that the

4075
02:55:51,318 --> 02:55:57,000
predicted tolerant group had a mass more

4076
02:55:54,318 --> 02:55:58,879
healthy area than the intolerant group

4077
02:55:57,000 --> 02:56:01,079
and importantly we see that there's not

4078
02:55:58,879 --> 02:56:03,358
a difference between the two groups in

4079
02:56:01,079 --> 02:56:06,279
the control treatment so this means that

4080
02:56:03,359 --> 02:56:08,680
our predicted tolerant group was able to

4081
02:56:06,279 --> 02:56:11,238
grow more and more healthy tissue in

4082
02:56:08,680 --> 02:56:13,639
heat without compromising their growth

4083
02:56:11,238 --> 02:56:15,559
in cold conditions and this is important

4084
02:56:13,639 --> 02:56:17,559
because on the farm it starts out cold

4085
02:56:15,559 --> 02:56:20,359
and gets warmer so you want the C to be

4086
02:56:17,559 --> 02:56:23,000
able to grow well in all of these

4087
02:56:20,359 --> 02:56:25,760
conditions now when we get up to

4088
02:56:23,000 --> 02:56:27,680
22c um we see that the tolerant group is

4089
02:56:25,760 --> 02:56:29,238
still maintaining more area than the

4090
02:56:27,680 --> 02:56:31,520
intolerant group but it's not

4091
02:56:29,238 --> 02:56:33,439
necessarily healthier um there's no

4092
02:56:31,520 --> 02:56:34,720
longer a significant difference there

4093
02:56:33,439 --> 02:56:36,600
although we did have kind of a small

4094
02:56:34,719 --> 02:56:39,920
sample size so possibly with more

4095
02:56:36,600 --> 02:56:42,120
samples that would be significant but uh

4096
02:56:39,920 --> 02:56:44,398
it's possible also that this tolerance

4097
02:56:42,120 --> 02:56:48,800
just didn't hold up to 22 which is

4098
02:56:44,398 --> 02:56:48,799
really quite stressful for the kelp

4099
02:56:50,000 --> 02:56:55,478
so what we've learned so far is that our

4100
02:56:52,200 --> 02:56:57,800
gites display a wide range in heat

4101
02:56:55,478 --> 02:57:00,238
tolerances even from just this

4102
02:56:57,799 --> 02:57:02,278
relatively small area from Maine to New

4103
02:57:00,238 --> 02:57:04,559
York where we've collected from and just

4104
02:57:02,279 --> 02:57:06,279
looking at 93 gites so this is really

4105
02:57:04,559 --> 02:57:08,519
promising that we have a lot of

4106
02:57:06,279 --> 02:57:11,359
variation to be able to select

4107
02:57:08,520 --> 02:57:12,760
on and we know that the sporify progyny

4108
02:57:11,359 --> 02:57:14,880
of our predicted heat tolerant

4109
02:57:12,760 --> 02:57:16,840
gametophytes did grow bigger and

4110
02:57:14,879 --> 02:57:20,358
healthier than the predicted intolerant

4111
02:57:16,840 --> 02:57:22,120
sporophytes at least up to 20° C so this

4112
02:57:20,359 --> 02:57:23,960
is really key and this is one of the

4113
02:57:22,120 --> 02:57:27,399
first studies that's really relating

4114
02:57:23,959 --> 02:57:29,759
gapy phenotypes um in kelp to sporify

4115
02:57:27,398 --> 02:57:31,119
phenotypes so making that connection is

4116
02:57:29,760 --> 02:57:33,318
going to be really important moving

4117
02:57:31,120 --> 02:57:36,680
forward um for heat tolerance or other

4118
02:57:33,318 --> 02:57:39,879
traits too looking at alginate sugar um

4119
02:57:36,680 --> 02:57:40,920
content manitol other desirable traits

4120
02:57:39,879 --> 02:57:43,159
for

4121
02:57:40,920 --> 02:57:45,279
aquaculture and we're even able to see

4122
02:57:43,159 --> 02:57:47,439
that there maybe some specific regions

4123
02:57:45,279 --> 02:57:48,640
of the genome that could be related to

4124
02:57:47,439 --> 02:57:50,680
heat tolerance

4125
02:57:48,639 --> 02:57:54,639
so we're currently conducting another

4126
02:57:50,680 --> 02:57:56,559
study another round of 90 gyes to add

4127
02:57:54,639 --> 02:57:59,439
data to this set so we can have a more

4128
02:57:56,559 --> 02:58:03,318
robust genomewide Association study and

4129
02:57:59,439 --> 02:58:06,000
maybe see what those Gene regions may be

4130
02:58:03,318 --> 02:58:08,559
doing so I think we've made a few steps

4131
02:58:06,000 --> 02:58:10,238
closer to our goal of producing heat

4132
02:58:08,559 --> 02:58:12,920
tolerant kelp to increase crop

4133
02:58:10,238 --> 02:58:14,760
reliability extend the growing season

4134
02:58:12,920 --> 02:58:17,159
and expand kelp farming to warmer

4135
02:58:14,760 --> 02:58:18,760
latitudes but of course always more work

4136
02:58:17,159 --> 02:58:20,680
to be done

4137
02:58:18,760 --> 02:58:23,120
and I want to really thank everyone who

4138
02:58:20,680 --> 02:58:25,479
contributed to this study folks in Scott

4139
02:58:23,120 --> 02:58:27,520
lindell's Lab at hooie as well as our

4140
02:58:25,478 --> 02:58:29,398
collaborators including Jean Luke who's

4141
02:58:27,520 --> 02:58:32,000
here in the audience um and all of our

4142
02:58:29,398 --> 02:58:35,959
funding sources and thank you all again

4143
02:58:32,000 --> 02:58:35,959
for being here I'm happy to take any

4144
02:58:36,398 --> 02:58:40,599
questions yeah that's a really great

4145
02:58:38,359 --> 02:58:44,479
question the regulations around that

4146
02:58:40,600 --> 02:58:47,439
vary a lot by state in the US um so for

4147
02:58:44,478 --> 02:58:49,679
example in Alaska they have a rule that

4148
02:58:47,439 --> 02:58:52,479
all the that you're growing has to be

4149
02:58:49,680 --> 02:58:54,559
sourced from um kelp within 50

4150
02:58:52,478 --> 02:58:57,438
kilometers of your farm and represent at

4151
02:58:54,559 --> 02:59:00,278
least 50 unique genetically Unique

4152
02:58:57,439 --> 02:59:03,600
Individuals um to try to preserve that

4153
02:59:00,279 --> 02:59:06,560
diversity um and Maine also has strict

4154
02:59:03,600 --> 02:59:09,399
rules about if youve you've gr taken

4155
02:59:06,559 --> 02:59:11,840
kelp out of Maine into the lab it can't

4156
02:59:09,398 --> 02:59:15,278
be planted back in Maine then some other

4157
02:59:11,840 --> 02:59:17,439
states that haven't had kelp naturally

4158
02:59:15,279 --> 02:59:19,520
growing in a while have a bit more laxed

4159
02:59:17,439 --> 02:59:21,479
policies because I guess they figure

4160
02:59:19,520 --> 02:59:23,238
well if kelp grows there not going to

4161
02:59:21,478 --> 02:59:24,879
interfere with the existing population

4162
02:59:23,238 --> 02:59:28,359
because there really isn't an existing

4163
02:59:24,879 --> 02:59:31,559
population um so it it does depend a lot

4164
02:59:28,359 --> 02:59:33,840
regulation Wise by state um but I think

4165
02:59:31,559 --> 02:59:36,079
biologically we still need to do more

4166
02:59:33,840 --> 02:59:38,920
research particularly each individual

4167
02:59:36,079 --> 02:59:41,799
species to understand what kind of is

4168
02:59:38,920 --> 02:59:44,000
the probability of interfering with the

4169
02:59:41,799 --> 02:59:47,398
local population how much diversity do

4170
02:59:44,000 --> 02:59:49,079
you need to ensure that you won't have

4171
02:59:47,398 --> 02:59:51,439
um things single genotypes kind of

4172
02:59:49,079 --> 02:59:53,279
taking over um I think a lot of that

4173
02:59:51,439 --> 02:59:57,279
research still needs to be done but

4174
02:59:53,279 --> 02:59:57,279
definitely a concern on Regulators

4175
02:59:58,840 --> 03:00:04,318
Minds oh great question so we keep the

4176
03:00:01,478 --> 03:00:06,760
gyes under red light to keep them in a

4177
03:00:04,318 --> 03:00:08,680
vegetative state so that prevents them

4178
03:00:06,760 --> 03:00:12,159
from becoming fertile until we're ready

4179
03:00:08,680 --> 03:00:12,159
to cross them and induce

4180
03:00:15,359 --> 03:00:23,600
fertility MH yeah certainly so um the

4181
03:00:20,719 --> 03:00:25,679
first question was Sor I can't say the

4182
03:00:23,600 --> 03:00:28,760
first question

4183
03:00:25,680 --> 03:00:31,079
again how ocean space right so in our

4184
03:00:28,760 --> 03:00:33,359
lab we mostly work on just pilot scale

4185
03:00:31,079 --> 03:00:36,000
Farms so really small and they're mostly

4186
03:00:33,359 --> 03:00:39,600
in coordination with either um existing

4187
03:00:36,000 --> 03:00:41,719
kelp companies that want to that have

4188
03:00:39,600 --> 03:00:46,120
leased the space and they want to test

4189
03:00:41,719 --> 03:00:48,119
out certain um Farm designs or um see

4190
03:00:46,120 --> 03:00:50,239
how different strains work and so we we

4191
03:00:48,120 --> 03:00:54,000
made Partnerships with companies to use

4192
03:00:50,238 --> 03:00:56,000
their space or um universities have um

4193
03:00:54,000 --> 03:00:59,318
that we can uh work with and we get

4194
03:00:56,000 --> 03:01:01,478
permits for just these small scale Farms

4195
03:00:59,318 --> 03:01:03,840
um but yeah there's certainly there's a

4196
03:01:01,478 --> 03:01:07,438
lot of other ocean users particularly in

4197
03:01:03,840 --> 03:01:09,478
Nearshore areas fishermen shell Fishers

4198
03:01:07,439 --> 03:01:11,760
um although sometimes we also do work

4199
03:01:09,478 --> 03:01:13,879
with shellfish farms and there's some

4200
03:01:11,760 --> 03:01:15,880
work also trying to integrate growing

4201
03:01:13,879 --> 03:01:18,519
seaweed next to shellfish for kind of

4202
03:01:15,879 --> 03:01:21,599
mutual benefits there

4203
03:01:18,520 --> 03:01:24,640
um so at larger scales uh there

4204
03:01:21,600 --> 03:01:26,279
certainly could be impacts of shading so

4205
03:01:24,639 --> 03:01:29,358
I think it would be important to choose

4206
03:01:26,279 --> 03:01:30,439
areas that maybe like have Sandy Bottom

4207
03:01:29,359 --> 03:01:33,680
where you don't have a lot of things

4208
03:01:30,439 --> 03:01:35,880
growing there anyway um or maybe do kind

4209
03:01:33,680 --> 03:01:38,120
of smaller patches of farms leaving

4210
03:01:35,879 --> 03:01:40,599
spaces for light in between there's lots

4211
03:01:38,120 --> 03:01:42,640
of study on engineering and design of

4212
03:01:40,600 --> 03:01:44,920
these Farms to be able to accommodate

4213
03:01:42,639 --> 03:01:49,119
existing uh sea

4214
03:01:44,920 --> 03:01:49,120
life thank you

4215
03:01:49,559 --> 03:01:55,478
oh interesting um yeah so we we did look

4216
03:01:53,559 --> 03:01:57,478
at some in a in a separate study I

4217
03:01:55,478 --> 03:02:00,639
didn't mention here with adult sporify

4218
03:01:57,478 --> 03:02:02,599
looked at interaction of heat and

4219
03:02:00,639 --> 03:02:04,439
nitrogen content because there's been

4220
03:02:02,600 --> 03:02:06,800
some studies that show that with

4221
03:02:04,439 --> 03:02:09,600
increased nitrogen maybe the kelp is

4222
03:02:06,799 --> 03:02:11,398
able to sort of overcome more heat

4223
03:02:09,600 --> 03:02:13,079
conditions um we didn't actually find

4224
03:02:11,398 --> 03:02:14,959
that was the case and so there and

4225
03:02:13,079 --> 03:02:16,639
there's been other work that shows other

4226
03:02:14,959 --> 03:02:18,478
species that that isn't always the case

4227
03:02:16,639 --> 03:02:20,039
so I think it is really region and

4228
03:02:18,478 --> 03:02:24,639
species dependent whether the extra

4229
03:02:20,040 --> 03:02:27,800
nitrogen is helpful um as far as

4230
03:02:24,639 --> 03:02:30,439
acidification generally more CO2 the

4231
03:02:27,799 --> 03:02:32,840
kelp kind of like um but there could be

4232
03:02:30,439 --> 03:02:35,120
indirect impacts by impacting other life

4233
03:02:32,840 --> 03:02:38,639
around them that may have some other

4234
03:02:35,120 --> 03:02:38,640
factors um

4235
03:02:38,799 --> 03:02:43,759
yeah yeah okay

4236
03:02:48,120 --> 03:02:54,960
um no we haven't we definitely see that

4237
03:02:51,639 --> 03:02:57,318
as on the farms as it gets closer to

4238
03:02:54,959 --> 03:02:59,919
Summer there's a lot more fowling on the

4239
03:02:57,318 --> 03:03:01,439
kelp um so there probably is a

4240
03:02:59,920 --> 03:03:04,200
relationship there which as things are

4241
03:03:01,439 --> 03:03:06,520
warming up um those organisms become

4242
03:03:04,200 --> 03:03:08,120
more abundant in the ocean perhaps so

4243
03:03:06,520 --> 03:03:10,600
there probably is also relationship with

4244
03:03:08,120 --> 03:03:13,600
other disease yeah we've not looked into

4245
03:03:10,600 --> 03:03:13,600
that

4246
03:03:14,920 --> 03:03:22,079
okay um I don't know if

4247
03:03:18,600 --> 03:03:25,079
we offer no yeah I don't think we have

4248
03:03:22,079 --> 03:03:28,439
really any ideas what's going on um it

4249
03:03:25,079 --> 03:03:31,600
seems really really random at this point

4250
03:03:28,439 --> 03:03:34,760
do you have you find any

4251
03:03:31,600 --> 03:03:36,600
particular yeah yes I mean I guess

4252
03:03:34,760 --> 03:03:39,520
because you know normally in nature an

4253
03:03:36,600 --> 03:03:42,238
individual spor fight has like millions

4254
03:03:39,520 --> 03:03:44,560
of spores so if one doesn't work with

4255
03:03:42,238 --> 03:03:47,398
one other one it doesn't matter for the

4256
03:03:44,559 --> 03:03:49,719
reproductive success of that spor fight

4257
03:03:47,398 --> 03:03:49,719
um

4258
03:03:51,359 --> 03:03:56,200
so yeah interestingly we didn't see any

4259
03:03:54,079 --> 03:03:58,398
correlation between heat tolerans and

4260
03:03:56,200 --> 03:04:00,159
the populations that these were sourced

4261
03:03:58,398 --> 03:04:02,599
from so we did look by region and then

4262
03:04:00,159 --> 03:04:05,119
also by population and there there was

4263
03:04:02,600 --> 03:04:07,800
into correlation there so it's really

4264
03:04:05,120 --> 03:04:10,200
amazing how much diversity we saw within

4265
03:04:07,799 --> 03:04:12,599
populations and then sometimes within a

4266
03:04:10,200 --> 03:04:14,880
single sporify so sometimes we had

4267
03:04:12,600 --> 03:04:17,040
essentially sibling gyes that were

4268
03:04:14,879 --> 03:04:18,639
soured from the same sporify that would

4269
03:04:17,040 --> 03:04:21,640
sometimes also have different heat

4270
03:04:18,639 --> 03:04:24,680
tolerances um but also important to note

4271
03:04:21,639 --> 03:04:26,680
these gites that I was testing um they

4272
03:04:24,680 --> 03:04:29,238
were originally sourc from sporophytes

4273
03:04:26,680 --> 03:04:32,920
collected back in 2018 and they've been

4274
03:04:29,238 --> 03:04:35,719
in a cold chamber storage basically for

4275
03:04:32,920 --> 03:04:37,559
five six years so it's possible that

4276
03:04:35,719 --> 03:04:40,238
through cell division in the cold

4277
03:04:37,559 --> 03:04:43,879
chamber they've re acclimated to all

4278
03:04:40,238 --> 03:04:45,600
kind of be at the same Baseline

4279
03:04:43,879 --> 03:04:49,639
maybe

4280
03:04:45,600 --> 03:04:49,640
okay so it's not quite like

4281
03:04:55,318 --> 03:04:59,840
oh dominance of

4282
03:04:56,840 --> 03:04:59,840
certain

4283
03:05:00,040 --> 03:05:04,600
yeah sorry I don't think I totally

4284
03:05:02,000 --> 03:05:04,600
understood the

4285
03:05:07,279 --> 03:05:12,920
question so the gites are actually a a

4286
03:05:10,478 --> 03:05:14,840
free living life stage so once the

4287
03:05:12,920 --> 03:05:16,600
spores get released they develop into

4288
03:05:14,840 --> 03:05:18,719
the gites and the males and females are

4289
03:05:16,600 --> 03:05:20,200
separate organism essentially at that

4290
03:05:18,719 --> 03:05:23,199
point and then the female will grow an

4291
03:05:20,200 --> 03:05:24,800
egg which the male will fertilize um and

4292
03:05:23,200 --> 03:05:28,560
at that point then the the spor fight

4293
03:05:24,799 --> 03:05:32,759
grows from the egg was that your

4294
03:05:28,559 --> 03:05:32,760
question it's deployed at that point

4295
03:05:34,959 --> 03:05:41,238
Y we did have we had represent

4296
03:05:37,680 --> 03:05:44,200
representation from about 11 of those um

4297
03:05:41,238 --> 03:05:47,478
15 populations I showed so pretty good

4298
03:05:44,200 --> 03:05:50,600
representation along all of the groups

4299
03:05:47,478 --> 03:05:53,438
um um yeah didn't look specifically that

4300
03:05:50,600 --> 03:05:55,520
was just yeah didn't look specifically

4301
03:05:53,439 --> 03:05:58,120
at ancestry

4302
03:05:55,520 --> 03:06:02,040
group from the two regions that was from

4303
03:05:58,120 --> 03:06:02,040
the gamita fights

4304
03:06:02,120 --> 03:06:08,120
um no no no those were from our gapy

4305
03:06:05,478 --> 03:06:10,478
collections um so they were collected

4306
03:06:08,120 --> 03:06:11,960
from Wild spor aites um but when I

4307
03:06:10,478 --> 03:06:14,478
showed the two regions that were not

4308
03:06:11,959 --> 03:06:16,879
different that was based on the um the

4309
03:06:14,478 --> 03:06:20,559
heat tolerance assessment of the 93

4310
03:06:16,879 --> 03:06:22,759
gapit from our germ plasm that have been

4311
03:06:20,559 --> 03:06:25,318
harvested and cultivated essentially in

4312
03:06:22,760 --> 03:06:25,318
vegetative

4313
03:06:25,590 --> 03:06:28,690
[Music]

4314
03:06:29,600 --> 03:06:38,640
form um probably not the kelp adults can

4315
03:06:35,478 --> 03:06:40,639
last more than a year though not

4316
03:06:38,639 --> 03:06:42,840
typically um but there is some research

4317
03:06:40,639 --> 03:06:46,760
showing that the gites can

4318
03:06:42,840 --> 03:06:49,920
actually kind of stay dormant in the

4319
03:06:46,760 --> 03:06:52,840
sediment I guess in case um conditions

4320
03:06:49,920 --> 03:06:55,359
are too warm or otherwise not favorable

4321
03:06:52,840 --> 03:06:57,040
and then become fertile when conditions

4322
03:06:55,359 --> 03:06:58,600
are better again but I don't think it's

4323
03:06:57,040 --> 03:07:00,040
years I think that's more like on a

4324
03:06:58,600 --> 03:07:02,920
month's time

4325
03:07:00,040 --> 03:07:04,800
scale yeah so it is kind of unnatural

4326
03:07:02,920 --> 03:07:08,680
the way we're keeping them for

4327
03:07:04,799 --> 03:07:11,639
sure a yes question back there or no

4328
03:07:08,680 --> 03:07:11,639
okay

4329
03:07:11,680 --> 03:07:18,520
yes KS without sugar I don't think so no

4330
03:07:16,120 --> 03:07:21,880
I think they've all got either some form

4331
03:07:18,520 --> 03:07:26,238
of alade or agar and the red seaweeds

4332
03:07:21,879 --> 03:07:29,920
have kagene in um yeah but the sugar

4333
03:07:26,238 --> 03:07:32,238
kelp just has more I guess than other

4334
03:07:29,920 --> 03:07:32,238
kelp

4335
03:07:33,719 --> 03:07:37,679
species yeah I don't know I don't know

4336
03:07:35,559 --> 03:07:39,238
if we have that but I mean it's it's not

4337
03:07:37,680 --> 03:07:41,318
like glucose sugar you know it's a

4338
03:07:39,238 --> 03:07:45,478
different form of polysaccharide so it

4339
03:07:41,318 --> 03:07:45,478
doesn't really taste sweet

4340
03:07:47,600 --> 03:07:52,880
yeah that's an interesting point so at

4341
03:07:49,680 --> 03:07:55,200
least in the US right now the structure

4342
03:07:52,879 --> 03:07:57,278
of farming particularly on the east

4343
03:07:55,200 --> 03:07:59,920
coast is that there are a few um kelp

4344
03:07:57,279 --> 03:08:02,640
hat trees that have the kelp seed the

4345
03:07:59,920 --> 03:08:05,600
gites basically and then farmers can buy

4346
03:08:02,639 --> 03:08:07,599
seed from there so I guess the the heat

4347
03:08:05,600 --> 03:08:08,800
tolerance breeding or any sort of

4348
03:08:07,600 --> 03:08:11,840
breeding would really happen in those

4349
03:08:08,799 --> 03:08:14,438
hatcheries um it could potentially be

4350
03:08:11,840 --> 03:08:16,200
farmers who want to breed their own um

4351
03:08:14,439 --> 03:08:19,279
but typically they're buying from larger

4352
03:08:16,200 --> 03:08:22,239
hatcheries and so the idea is that maybe

4353
03:08:19,279 --> 03:08:24,479
if we can identify genes related to heat

4354
03:08:22,238 --> 03:08:26,600
tolerance it'll be easier for hatri to

4355
03:08:24,478 --> 03:08:31,079
sort of screen their collections to see

4356
03:08:26,600 --> 03:08:31,079
if they can find individuals with those

4357
03:08:31,359 --> 03:08:38,800
traits we have our final speaker for the

4358
03:08:35,520 --> 03:08:40,600
Symposium Uh Kevin folta is a professor

4359
03:08:38,799 --> 03:08:42,358
of horiculture Sciences at the

4360
03:08:40,600 --> 03:08:43,479
University of Florida where he

4361
03:08:42,359 --> 03:08:44,920
researches

4370
03:09:01,478 --> 03:09:05,639
agricultural communication today he will

4371
03:09:03,920 --> 03:09:07,318
highlight work on breeding crops for

4372
03:09:05,639 --> 03:09:10,159
controlled environments in his talk

4373
03:09:07,318 --> 03:09:12,439
titled controlling e controlling G new

4374
03:09:10,159 --> 03:09:13,840
crops for controlled environments thank

4375
03:09:12,439 --> 03:09:16,439
you

4376
03:09:13,840 --> 03:09:19,200
Kevin well I guess I have to start out

4377
03:09:16,439 --> 03:09:23,000
by admitting I've got organism

4378
03:09:19,200 --> 03:09:27,040
Envy you got like jaff AO Malo and Harry

4379
03:09:23,000 --> 03:09:28,120
vetch and sugar help and mushrooms and I

4380
03:09:27,040 --> 03:09:30,880
got

4381
03:09:28,120 --> 03:09:32,560
lettuce um but but but I do weird stuff

4382
03:09:30,879 --> 03:09:35,119
to it and that's kind of the take-home

4383
03:09:32,559 --> 03:09:36,920
message is yeah in thinking about the

4384
03:09:35,120 --> 03:09:38,960
presentation today which is most

4385
03:09:36,920 --> 03:09:41,478
appropriate for perhaps a younger

4386
03:09:38,959 --> 03:09:44,478
audience for a a student organized

4387
03:09:41,478 --> 03:09:45,639
Consortium is when I was in your shoes I

4388
03:09:44,478 --> 03:09:47,079
was thinking you know everything's

4389
03:09:45,639 --> 03:09:50,439
pretty much figured out already what am

4390
03:09:47,079 --> 03:09:52,760
I going to do and I think what happens

4391
03:09:50,439 --> 03:09:55,200
is you start to find funny Avenues of

4392
03:09:52,760 --> 03:09:57,439
research to open up the more you think

4393
03:09:55,200 --> 03:10:00,279
about ways that we can think of useful

4394
03:09:57,439 --> 03:10:02,960
application and also new ways to solve

4395
03:10:00,279 --> 03:10:04,840
old problems and I'll be the first to

4396
03:10:02,959 --> 03:10:06,879
admit I'm not smart as most of the

4397
03:10:04,840 --> 03:10:08,478
people I work with but I'm clever and I

4398
03:10:06,879 --> 03:10:10,478
work hard and I think you'll see that's

4399
03:10:08,478 --> 03:10:13,559
kind of the theme here there's different

4400
03:10:10,478 --> 03:10:15,519
ways you can solve a problem and uh and

4401
03:10:13,559 --> 03:10:16,879
come up with new new technology and I

4402
03:10:15,520 --> 03:10:18,279
think that's that's what we're going to

4403
03:10:16,879 --> 03:10:20,199
cover

4404
03:10:18,279 --> 03:10:21,760
um so today we'll talk about uh genetics

4405
03:10:20,200 --> 03:10:23,079
and environment we'll talk about the way

4406
03:10:21,760 --> 03:10:25,880
these things work together so my

4407
03:10:23,079 --> 03:10:28,039
laboratory oops um it does a lot of

4408
03:10:25,879 --> 03:10:29,879
stuff we historically have worked with

4409
03:10:28,040 --> 03:10:31,960
strawberry genomics we were the

4410
03:10:29,879 --> 03:10:34,079
laboratory that led the sequencing

4411
03:10:31,959 --> 03:10:35,599
effort of the diploid strawberry way

4412
03:10:34,079 --> 03:10:38,318
back in

4413
03:10:35,600 --> 03:10:41,800
2010 and it was the 12th plant genome

4414
03:10:38,318 --> 03:10:44,879
sequenced with no no physical map and

4415
03:10:41,799 --> 03:10:47,000
all um all short read assembly pretty

4416
03:10:44,879 --> 03:10:49,199
cool stuff back then and then we do some

4417
03:10:47,000 --> 03:10:53,079
stuff with light and then uh the best

4418
03:10:49,200 --> 03:10:56,680
project is how we wreck things uh plants

4419
03:10:53,079 --> 03:10:59,200
and microbes with uh random peptides so

4420
03:10:56,680 --> 03:11:01,840
we find lethal peptides that kill things

4421
03:10:59,200 --> 03:11:03,399
that's really kind of neat and then new

4422
03:11:01,840 --> 03:11:06,000
crops for Florida was kind of born

4423
03:11:03,398 --> 03:11:09,159
through covid um we're experimenting

4424
03:11:06,000 --> 03:11:10,600
with ways to grow uh find new crops that

4425
03:11:09,159 --> 03:11:13,959
can work really good really well on

4426
03:11:10,600 --> 03:11:15,920
small farms and uh really exploring the

4427
03:11:13,959 --> 03:11:18,799
universe of of novelty to see what we

4428
03:11:15,920 --> 03:11:21,439
can do for small farmers to introduce uh

4429
03:11:18,799 --> 03:11:23,879
local consumers to uh things they've

4430
03:11:21,439 --> 03:11:25,520
never tried before and things that do

4431
03:11:23,879 --> 03:11:28,438
very well it turns out that's actually

4432
03:11:25,520 --> 03:11:31,238
been really exciting work mostly because

4433
03:11:28,439 --> 03:11:33,920
um in my um when I'm not at work I'm at

4434
03:11:31,238 --> 03:11:36,719
home at work um I got married to a

4435
03:11:33,920 --> 03:11:39,639
farmer and she's uh she was a

4436
03:11:36,719 --> 03:11:44,000
subsistence farmer in Ukraine who uh

4437
03:11:39,639 --> 03:11:47,559
came to the US to my town uh and um and

4438
03:11:44,000 --> 03:11:49,639
uh now we we do um a lot of stuff we

4439
03:11:47,559 --> 03:11:51,478
grow seasonal fruits and vegetables we

4440
03:11:49,639 --> 03:11:53,159
also do turkeys and pigs and chickens

4441
03:11:51,478 --> 03:11:55,238
and eggs and all we sell at the farmers

4442
03:11:53,159 --> 03:12:00,559
market every Saturday except I won't be

4443
03:11:55,238 --> 03:12:03,639
there tomorrow um ha um so uh and and

4444
03:12:00,559 --> 03:12:06,079
then uh last year at 56 years old I

4445
03:12:03,639 --> 03:12:07,680
started a new kind of breeding project I

4446
03:12:06,079 --> 03:12:10,959
got an

4447
03:12:07,680 --> 03:12:12,720
F1 that's kind of cool um she'll be at

4448
03:12:10,959 --> 03:12:15,879
the market tomorrow she's the main

4449
03:12:12,719 --> 03:12:18,760
attraction so um so I so I get to not

4450
03:12:15,879 --> 03:12:22,039
only research in fruits and vegetables

4451
03:12:18,760 --> 03:12:25,040
and uh and and how to grow them better I

4452
03:12:22,040 --> 03:12:27,399
also get to do it and expose consumers

4453
03:12:25,040 --> 03:12:28,840
to things they've never tried before and

4454
03:12:27,398 --> 03:12:32,680
it's really exciting it's a lot of fun

4455
03:12:28,840 --> 03:12:36,120
to be able to do both both things so um

4456
03:12:32,680 --> 03:12:40,520
what we'll talk about today is how we

4457
03:12:36,120 --> 03:12:42,840
can think about G&amp;E in creative ways um

4458
03:12:40,520 --> 03:12:44,238
so one of the big problems with

4459
03:12:42,840 --> 03:12:45,799
controlled environments and we get

4460
03:12:44,238 --> 03:12:47,799
excited about controlled environment

4461
03:12:45,799 --> 03:12:51,599
companies I think of all the good things

4462
03:12:47,799 --> 03:12:53,639
they can do we can repurpose the uh

4463
03:12:51,600 --> 03:12:57,200
infrastructure in urban areas we can

4464
03:12:53,639 --> 03:13:01,719
train an urban Workforce for high paying

4465
03:12:57,200 --> 03:13:04,239
or well okay paying um uh highly skilled

4466
03:13:01,719 --> 03:13:09,039
jobs that you can move up in inside a

4467
03:13:04,238 --> 03:13:12,279
company um short short um I've been up

4468
03:13:09,040 --> 03:13:14,960
for 36 hours so blanking on Words um

4469
03:13:12,279 --> 03:13:16,880
short uh supply chain you know it it

4470
03:13:14,959 --> 03:13:18,438
goes right to the consumer down the

4471
03:13:16,879 --> 03:13:21,199
street Street rather than across the

4472
03:13:18,439 --> 03:13:23,279
country low carbon footprint we get uh

4473
03:13:21,200 --> 03:13:25,399
water savings all these things are

4474
03:13:23,279 --> 03:13:27,880
really really strong suits of of

4475
03:13:25,398 --> 03:13:30,398
controlled environment agriculture

4476
03:13:27,879 --> 03:13:33,639
commercially the problem is the amount

4477
03:13:30,398 --> 03:13:36,959
of energy that's needed so can we think

4478
03:13:33,639 --> 03:13:39,079
of clever ways to invent varieties that

4479
03:13:36,959 --> 03:13:41,679
will do better inside that controlled

4480
03:13:39,079 --> 03:13:44,760
environment and um can we come up maybe

4481
03:13:41,680 --> 03:13:47,520
with new practices new ways to deliver

4482
03:13:44,760 --> 03:13:50,279
that energy that can make these things

4483
03:13:47,520 --> 03:13:53,120
more viable and I've worked with a

4484
03:13:50,279 --> 03:13:55,960
variety of companies over the years and

4485
03:13:53,120 --> 03:13:58,520
um in different capacities um all of

4486
03:13:55,959 --> 03:14:00,719
them have gone out of business so I

4487
03:13:58,520 --> 03:14:03,479
didn't do much for them I guess but but

4488
03:14:00,719 --> 03:14:05,639
but this just shows how they're how

4489
03:14:03,478 --> 03:14:06,920
there is a need for thinking about this

4490
03:14:05,639 --> 03:14:08,478
differently and that's what I've always

4491
03:14:06,920 --> 03:14:10,478
kind of brought to the table that kind

4492
03:14:08,478 --> 03:14:12,000
of why they invited me in I guess the

4493
03:14:10,478 --> 03:14:13,639
other part of this is that I've gone to

4494
03:14:12,000 --> 03:14:15,879
a lot of meetings over the years in

4495
03:14:13,639 --> 03:14:17,680
controlled environment Agriculture and

4496
03:14:15,879 --> 03:14:20,199
have really stirred the pot because I've

4497
03:14:17,680 --> 03:14:22,000
come up with seemed like radical ideas

4498
03:14:20,200 --> 03:14:24,680
like just don't grow them under a pink

4499
03:14:22,000 --> 03:14:26,840
light change the lighting as it plants

4500
03:14:24,680 --> 03:14:29,520
change through development don't just

4501
03:14:26,840 --> 03:14:32,159
grow them under light control how they

4502
03:14:29,520 --> 03:14:34,279
grow we invented the concept of plant

4503
03:14:32,159 --> 03:14:36,879
Whispering can you give plants a

4504
03:14:34,279 --> 03:14:39,159
vocabulary of light signals to control

4505
03:14:36,879 --> 03:14:40,839
growth and development and and just such

4506
03:14:39,159 --> 03:14:43,398
a it seemed like such a better idea and

4507
03:14:40,840 --> 03:14:46,200
that's kind of where we are now and also

4508
03:14:43,398 --> 03:14:47,760
the idea that um the which seemed kind

4509
03:14:46,200 --> 03:14:50,600
of silly but was really important and

4510
03:14:47,760 --> 03:14:53,079
what we'll talk about today is is don't

4511
03:14:50,600 --> 03:14:55,359
just stick any plant from the field into

4512
03:14:53,079 --> 03:14:58,079
the box and expect it to

4513
03:14:55,359 --> 03:15:00,920
perform just like any environment you

4514
03:14:58,079 --> 03:15:02,760
have to breed for it and that's I'll

4515
03:15:00,920 --> 03:15:06,120
show you how we are starting to think

4516
03:15:02,760 --> 03:15:08,800
about that today and we know that uh

4517
03:15:06,120 --> 03:15:10,720
plant uh growth and development is plant

4518
03:15:08,799 --> 03:15:13,478
productivity is really a mixture of

4519
03:15:10,719 --> 03:15:16,159
genetics uh environment management and

4520
03:15:13,478 --> 03:15:18,199
that how those three things align

4521
03:15:16,159 --> 03:15:21,000
provide us with some sort of useful

4522
03:15:18,200 --> 03:15:24,279
commercial plant output and the

4523
03:15:21,000 --> 03:15:28,279
important message in this is

4524
03:15:24,279 --> 03:15:30,880
that that you have some certain set of

4525
03:15:28,279 --> 03:15:33,720
genetics that you can only stretch so

4526
03:15:30,879 --> 03:15:36,000
far by changing the environment they the

4527
03:15:33,719 --> 03:15:39,119
the the the genetics are constrained by

4528
03:15:36,000 --> 03:15:42,000
the environment that they're in and um

4529
03:15:39,120 --> 03:15:44,079
and uh in the field we can only thing we

4530
03:15:42,000 --> 03:15:46,600
can control are the genetics and the

4531
03:15:44,079 --> 03:15:47,600
management we're at the mercy of the

4532
03:15:46,600 --> 03:15:49,439
Environ

4533
03:15:47,600 --> 03:15:52,159
which is which is really the one of the

4534
03:15:49,439 --> 03:15:54,000
main problems um we're at the mercy of

4535
03:15:52,159 --> 03:15:56,879
the environment okay and then in

4536
03:15:54,000 --> 03:15:58,680
controlled closed environment such as

4537
03:15:56,879 --> 03:16:01,119
these uh you know operations with

4538
03:15:58,680 --> 03:16:03,840
artificial lighting we can control

4539
03:16:01,120 --> 03:16:06,000
management in the environment and now we

4540
03:16:03,840 --> 03:16:08,559
need genetics that

4541
03:16:06,000 --> 03:16:10,920
fit and that's the argument that that

4542
03:16:08,559 --> 03:16:13,799
I've always made because I think the

4543
03:16:10,920 --> 03:16:17,000
problem here oops where are we here the

4544
03:16:13,799 --> 03:16:20,159
problem is this same as this it's it's

4545
03:16:17,000 --> 03:16:24,120
like trying to win a dog sled race with

4546
03:16:20,159 --> 03:16:26,719
doxin you've got a a breed that was not

4547
03:16:24,120 --> 03:16:28,720
made for that environment not performing

4548
03:16:26,719 --> 03:16:30,438
well in that environment and you're the

4549
03:16:28,719 --> 03:16:32,959
guy on the back of the sled saying

4550
03:16:30,439 --> 03:16:34,760
what's wrong right you need to have a

4551
03:16:32,959 --> 03:16:36,879
breed that's made for that environment

4552
03:16:34,760 --> 03:16:39,680
that likes the cold likes the snow likes

4553
03:16:36,879 --> 03:16:42,478
strong likes like is excited by exertion

4554
03:16:39,680 --> 03:16:45,600
that kind of thing so you have to have

4555
03:16:42,478 --> 03:16:48,398
the right variety for the environment

4556
03:16:45,600 --> 03:16:50,199
you're using and to a lot of folks in

4557
03:16:48,398 --> 03:16:52,959
the controlled environment space this

4558
03:16:50,199 --> 03:16:54,479
was like an insane idea because a lot of

4559
03:16:52,959 --> 03:16:56,159
this is all dictated by folks who were

4560
03:16:54,478 --> 03:16:58,398
in the technology and lights and things

4561
03:16:56,159 --> 03:17:01,238
like that they forgot that the most

4562
03:16:58,398 --> 03:17:04,278
complicated machine in that room is the

4563
03:17:01,238 --> 03:17:07,198
plant and radically under thought that

4564
03:17:04,279 --> 03:17:08,960
that part of the equation and so I think

4565
03:17:07,199 --> 03:17:10,239
um these ideas were starting to

4566
03:17:08,959 --> 03:17:13,438
introduce

4567
03:17:10,238 --> 03:17:15,600
now so uh so here's the crisis and

4568
03:17:13,439 --> 03:17:17,359
opportunity so what are the things that

4569
03:17:15,600 --> 03:17:20,359
we breed for in the field what are some

4570
03:17:17,359 --> 03:17:21,840
important field traits and yield yield

4571
03:17:20,359 --> 03:17:25,040
okay what

4572
03:17:21,840 --> 03:17:25,920
else what else what else the consumer

4573
03:17:25,040 --> 03:17:29,080
what what

4574
03:17:25,920 --> 03:17:31,559
else yield all right Yi yeah we love

4575
03:17:29,079 --> 03:17:34,199
that yield love lots of it yeah

4576
03:17:31,559 --> 03:17:35,719
yes the timing of flowering right is is

4577
03:17:34,199 --> 03:17:38,520
it an appropriate plant for your long

4578
03:17:35,719 --> 03:17:40,639
days or short days what else we got what

4579
03:17:38,520 --> 03:17:40,640
was

4580
03:17:43,719 --> 03:17:47,799
it my ears are ringing from lack of

4581
03:17:46,238 --> 03:17:51,439
sleep

4582
03:17:47,799 --> 03:17:54,799
what was it pathogens and disease P

4583
03:17:51,439 --> 03:17:56,520
pathogen resistance right and um and and

4584
03:17:54,799 --> 03:17:58,599
and maybe some other stuff like you know

4585
03:17:56,520 --> 03:18:00,840
Water Resources other other there tons

4586
03:17:58,600 --> 03:18:03,840
of things that you need shipping you

4587
03:18:00,840 --> 03:18:06,159
know can I send this from California to

4588
03:18:03,840 --> 03:18:08,880
uh itha New York and have it still show

4589
03:18:06,159 --> 03:18:12,520
up in a pretty decent state right so the

4590
03:18:08,879 --> 03:18:15,920
priorities for the field are things that

4591
03:18:12,520 --> 03:18:17,560
benefit the producer not necessarily the

4592
03:18:15,920 --> 03:18:20,398
things the consumer

4593
03:18:17,559 --> 03:18:22,799
wants so if we can control that

4594
03:18:20,398 --> 03:18:25,879
environment and have a more

4595
03:18:22,799 --> 03:18:27,799
locally set set what what are some of

4596
03:18:25,879 --> 03:18:32,318
the things we could breed

4597
03:18:27,799 --> 03:18:32,318
for flavor and Aroma right what

4598
03:18:33,398 --> 03:18:37,478
else appearance make them look better

4599
03:18:35,920 --> 03:18:40,040
make make it so the kids want to eat

4600
03:18:37,478 --> 03:18:43,879
their veggies right what

4601
03:18:40,040 --> 03:18:46,239
else what was it lower inputs right

4602
03:18:43,879 --> 03:18:47,959
things that survive on maybe a a

4603
03:18:46,238 --> 03:18:50,079
Sprinkle of nutrients that we can

4604
03:18:47,959 --> 03:18:52,719
control precisely through hydroponic or

4605
03:18:50,079 --> 03:18:54,840
other types of means and then uh precise

4606
03:18:52,719 --> 03:18:58,959
amounts of water which is becoming an

4607
03:18:54,840 --> 03:19:01,000
increasingly scarce resource um maybe uh

4608
03:18:58,959 --> 03:19:03,159
things that don't require pollination

4609
03:19:01,000 --> 03:19:06,159
maybe things that are seedless maybe

4610
03:19:03,159 --> 03:19:08,520
things that um you know still have good

4611
03:19:06,159 --> 03:19:11,199
yield um you know you can think of all

4612
03:19:08,520 --> 03:19:14,399
of these different uh qualities that

4613
03:19:11,199 --> 03:19:15,920
would lend themselves very much to uh to

4614
03:19:14,398 --> 03:19:18,159
growth in a controlled environment and I

4615
03:19:15,920 --> 03:19:20,879
give some ideas here here because here

4616
03:19:18,159 --> 03:19:23,719
if we we can control the E it means that

4617
03:19:20,879 --> 03:19:25,318
we can play with G and that means we can

4618
03:19:23,719 --> 03:19:27,760
have a whole set of new

4619
03:19:25,318 --> 03:19:29,959
priorities and as we are going through

4620
03:19:27,760 --> 03:19:32,040
the idea of field priorities it was

4621
03:19:29,959 --> 03:19:33,759
yield yield yield right disease

4622
03:19:32,040 --> 03:19:37,760
resistance these kinds of things can you

4623
03:19:33,760 --> 03:19:39,680
ship it uh post Harvest quality but if

4624
03:19:37,760 --> 03:19:41,840
we can if we have the opportunity to

4625
03:19:39,680 --> 03:19:45,040
breed for the specific environment

4626
03:19:41,840 --> 03:19:47,359
because we can constrain e now we can

4627
03:19:45,040 --> 03:19:49,080
look for things that maybe grow rapidly

4628
03:19:47,359 --> 03:19:52,760
get out of the box fast get something

4629
03:19:49,079 --> 03:19:55,000
that has few that lends to fewer inputs

4630
03:19:52,760 --> 03:19:58,439
uh reduce plant stature ease of harvest

4631
03:19:55,000 --> 03:20:01,040
High crop value um a use of less energy

4632
03:19:58,439 --> 03:20:03,600
we'll get to that but then novel flavors

4633
03:20:01,040 --> 03:20:06,239
and colors uh when you induce the

4634
03:20:03,600 --> 03:20:08,520
flowers can we flip a switch and turn

4635
03:20:06,238 --> 03:20:10,159
make the plant flow think of how much

4636
03:20:08,520 --> 03:20:13,560
money that would save for the cut flow

4637
03:20:10,159 --> 03:20:17,639
industry being able to stop flour things

4638
03:20:13,559 --> 03:20:20,119
like basil lettuce shut it down um

4639
03:20:17,639 --> 03:20:22,639
manipul manipulating neutraceutical

4640
03:20:20,120 --> 03:20:25,040
value um not need pollinators we don't

4641
03:20:22,639 --> 03:20:27,318
have the same disease pressure it may be

4642
03:20:25,040 --> 03:20:29,279
different or maybe none at all some of

4643
03:20:27,318 --> 03:20:32,359
the new places are growing plants for

4644
03:20:29,279 --> 03:20:35,120
medicinal production uh do this in clean

4645
03:20:32,359 --> 03:20:37,559
rooms with absolutely no pest pressure

4646
03:20:35,120 --> 03:20:40,479
do this in space suits and all that good

4647
03:20:37,559 --> 03:20:43,680
stuff um and one of my favorites is

4648
03:20:40,478 --> 03:20:46,079
plasticity multiple phenotypes from one

4649
03:20:43,680 --> 03:20:47,880
genotype can we flip the switch and

4650
03:20:46,079 --> 03:20:49,120
produce a slightly different product and

4651
03:20:47,879 --> 03:20:52,278
I'll show you some evidence of that

4652
03:20:49,120 --> 03:20:53,560
later pretty cool stuff it all boils

4653
03:20:52,279 --> 03:20:54,800
down to this idea is that when you're

4654
03:20:53,559 --> 03:20:58,600
breeding for the

4655
03:20:54,799 --> 03:21:01,000
field plant breeders want a plant a an

4656
03:20:58,600 --> 03:21:03,960
exceptional cultivar is one that is

4657
03:21:01,000 --> 03:21:04,680
always good no matter what happens in

4658
03:21:03,959 --> 03:21:06,398
the

4659
03:21:04,680 --> 03:21:08,000
environment because you're going to have

4660
03:21:06,398 --> 03:21:11,079
cloudy days and rainy days you're going

4661
03:21:08,000 --> 03:21:12,760
to have sunny days and drought yet your

4662
03:21:11,079 --> 03:21:14,920
your product that comes out is always

4663
03:21:12,760 --> 03:21:17,920
going to be acceptable with maybe some

4664
03:21:14,920 --> 03:21:20,680
minor different times when it's not

4665
03:21:17,920 --> 03:21:23,040
when you can control the environment you

4666
03:21:20,680 --> 03:21:25,479
can control that trade presentation so

4667
03:21:23,040 --> 03:21:27,080
that's it's always optimal and that's

4668
03:21:25,478 --> 03:21:29,398
what's exciting about this kind of

4669
03:21:27,079 --> 03:21:32,439
approach can you breed something that

4670
03:21:29,398 --> 03:21:36,840
fits this particular

4671
03:21:32,439 --> 03:21:39,120
spot and uh and can we develop energy

4672
03:21:36,840 --> 03:21:40,439
star plants and that's the thing I've

4673
03:21:39,120 --> 03:21:42,680
been thinking about as someone with a

4674
03:21:40,439 --> 03:21:46,639
background in photomorphic Genesis can

4675
03:21:42,680 --> 03:21:50,600
we de develop cultiv ours that wisely

4676
03:21:46,639 --> 03:21:52,639
invest their photons that turn um

4677
03:21:50,600 --> 03:21:55,800
signals from the ambient environment

4678
03:21:52,639 --> 03:21:58,119
into into more immediate developmental

4679
03:21:55,799 --> 03:22:02,719
change get them fast out of the out of

4680
03:21:58,120 --> 03:22:04,560
the gate to the industry a day is money

4681
03:22:02,719 --> 03:22:06,799
so if you can make it grow faster in the

4682
03:22:04,559 --> 03:22:09,238
early development that translates

4683
03:22:06,799 --> 03:22:13,438
potentially to millions of dollars at

4684
03:22:09,238 --> 03:22:16,039
the commercial level so if we were to do

4685
03:22:13,439 --> 03:22:17,600
that are there some ways that we could

4686
03:22:16,040 --> 03:22:20,399
just take take a look at the existing

4687
03:22:17,600 --> 03:22:23,120
germ plasm in any given crop and start

4688
03:22:20,398 --> 03:22:26,039
to make decisions about which uh which

4689
03:22:23,120 --> 03:22:27,760
variety we may choose because of its

4690
03:22:26,040 --> 03:22:30,640
ability to integrate environmental

4691
03:22:27,760 --> 03:22:33,238
signals more thoroughly and that was the

4692
03:22:30,639 --> 03:22:36,238
hypothesis we went to test and it was

4693
03:22:33,238 --> 03:22:38,238
based on the idea um of the fact that

4694
03:22:36,238 --> 03:22:40,719
plants have multiple photosensory

4695
03:22:38,238 --> 03:22:45,680
systems different systems that sense the

4696
03:22:40,719 --> 03:22:47,559
red blue uh ultraviolet near UV U far

4697
03:22:45,680 --> 03:22:50,840
red and even the green portion of the

4698
03:22:47,559 --> 03:22:52,959
spectrum and tailor physiological

4699
03:22:50,840 --> 03:22:55,159
responses these are all mediated through

4700
03:22:52,959 --> 03:22:57,799
different photosensory

4701
03:22:55,159 --> 03:22:59,840
Pathways and could we

4702
03:22:57,799 --> 03:23:03,039
identify varieties that have been

4703
03:22:59,840 --> 03:23:05,559
selected because they had a better

4704
03:23:03,040 --> 03:23:08,199
response because of throughput through

4705
03:23:05,559 --> 03:23:10,600
these individual light sensing Pathways

4706
03:23:08,199 --> 03:23:13,199
so in other words is something more

4707
03:23:10,600 --> 03:23:14,760
sensitive to Red more likely to give us

4708
03:23:13,199 --> 03:23:17,199
a better yield and looking for those

4709
03:23:14,760 --> 03:23:19,559
associations between early later growth

4710
03:23:17,199 --> 03:23:21,520
and that's what we're working on now but

4711
03:23:19,559 --> 03:23:24,519
the big deal is is that you have all of

4712
03:23:21,520 --> 03:23:26,840
these different input channels that we

4713
03:23:24,520 --> 03:23:30,319
can monitor very easily in very rapid

4714
03:23:26,840 --> 03:23:32,520
experiments at the seedling level to be

4715
03:23:30,318 --> 03:23:34,959
begin to ask questions about potential

4716
03:23:32,520 --> 03:23:38,079
plant productivity and quality down the

4717
03:23:34,959 --> 03:23:41,358
road so we think about a rabid opsis

4718
03:23:38,079 --> 03:23:43,799
talk about going back to organism Envy

4719
03:23:41,359 --> 03:23:45,720
the most mundane Critter on the earth um

4720
03:23:43,799 --> 03:23:48,639
it but a rabid opsis is great because we

4721
03:23:45,719 --> 03:23:52,318
know a lot about it so this arabid these

4722
03:23:48,639 --> 03:23:55,959
two arabidopsis seeds are well these two

4723
03:23:52,318 --> 03:23:57,879
plants two seedlings are um siblings

4724
03:23:55,959 --> 03:24:00,719
from the same celite one next to each

4725
03:23:57,879 --> 03:24:02,000
other in that little seed pod and the

4726
03:24:00,719 --> 03:24:04,198
difference is is that they have

4727
03:24:02,000 --> 03:24:06,120
radically different morphologies the

4728
03:24:04,199 --> 03:24:08,359
difference happening because one was

4729
03:24:06,120 --> 03:24:09,600
grown in darkness one was grown under

4730
03:24:08,359 --> 03:24:11,399
complete light

4731
03:24:09,600 --> 03:24:13,520
spectrum and you can see some

4732
03:24:11,398 --> 03:24:16,358
significant changes an inhibition of

4733
03:24:13,520 --> 03:24:18,840
hypot elongation expansion of calans

4734
03:24:16,359 --> 03:24:20,600
vment of chloroplast and chlorophyll I a

4735
03:24:18,840 --> 03:24:22,960
little root elongation thing going on

4736
03:24:20,600 --> 03:24:24,238
there so the these differences were

4737
03:24:22,959 --> 03:24:26,759
brought about because of that

4738
03:24:24,238 --> 03:24:28,680
environmental signal I always like to

4739
03:24:26,760 --> 03:24:30,279
show this in in schools I always say

4740
03:24:28,680 --> 03:24:31,920
it's like having twins and one of you

4741
03:24:30,279 --> 03:24:34,640
goes in the closet for 10 years and

4742
03:24:31,920 --> 03:24:38,840
comes out taller you know um kids get

4743
03:24:34,639 --> 03:24:41,278
that idea so uh if we were to look at

4744
03:24:38,840 --> 03:24:44,120
some of these cues that light brings

4745
03:24:41,279 --> 03:24:47,800
about such as uh changes in hypoc

4746
03:24:44,120 --> 03:24:49,840
elongation or or um or Calen expansion

4747
03:24:47,799 --> 03:24:52,079
could that give us hints as to certain

4748
03:24:49,840 --> 03:24:53,639
varieties that may be more suited for

4749
03:24:52,079 --> 03:24:55,719
growth in a controlled environment

4750
03:24:53,639 --> 03:24:58,318
because they integrate photons

4751
03:24:55,719 --> 03:25:00,159
better and that's the hypothesis and the

4752
03:24:58,318 --> 03:25:01,760
lettuce is kind of neat because there's

4753
03:25:00,159 --> 03:25:05,159
a lot of different varieties of lettuce

4754
03:25:01,760 --> 03:25:08,398
out there and lots of variation in color

4755
03:25:05,159 --> 03:25:10,520
and and uh and other qualities there

4756
03:25:08,398 --> 03:25:13,840
it's highly homozygous so it gives us a

4757
03:25:10,520 --> 03:25:16,399
lot of opportunity to later on do very

4758
03:25:13,840 --> 03:25:20,719
sophisticated uh experiments to identify

4759
03:25:16,398 --> 03:25:25,000
IFI causal genes and um it's easy to do

4760
03:25:20,719 --> 03:25:27,358
these experiments on Petri dishes in 96

4761
03:25:25,000 --> 03:25:29,199
hours so instead of growing fields of

4762
03:25:27,359 --> 03:25:31,399
plants to identify it's it's a lot like

4763
03:25:29,199 --> 03:25:33,319
marker assisted breeding the only thing

4764
03:25:31,398 --> 03:25:35,519
is we're looking at we're looking at

4765
03:25:33,318 --> 03:25:38,278
markers which are morphological we're

4766
03:25:35,520 --> 03:25:40,640
looking at how the seedling behaves

4767
03:25:38,279 --> 03:25:43,399
rather than looking at a PCR product or

4768
03:25:40,639 --> 03:25:45,478
a DNA sequence we also are working on

4769
03:25:43,398 --> 03:25:47,358
automating this to be able to do massive

4770
03:25:45,478 --> 03:25:49,679
numbers of seedling at one time so

4771
03:25:47,359 --> 03:25:52,439
that's something else that's coming but

4772
03:25:49,680 --> 03:25:55,559
the what we what the hyp main hypothesis

4773
03:25:52,439 --> 03:25:57,639
was is that if we see hyp sensitivity in

4774
03:25:55,559 --> 03:25:59,760
a Seedling it may translate to

4775
03:25:57,639 --> 03:26:02,840
efficiency in mature plants or at least

4776
03:25:59,760 --> 03:26:05,120
be able to get to be a mature plant

4777
03:26:02,840 --> 03:26:07,120
faster the other part of this is that

4778
03:26:05,120 --> 03:26:10,800
could we look to hypers sensitivity to

4779
03:26:07,120 --> 03:26:13,079
blue or red far red and be able to breed

4780
03:26:10,799 --> 03:26:15,039
these things together to get all of the

4781
03:26:13,079 --> 03:26:16,600
hypers sensitivities in one place at one

4782
03:26:15,040 --> 03:26:18,120
time

4783
03:26:16,600 --> 03:26:20,880
and the other part of this is that could

4784
03:26:18,120 --> 03:26:22,840
we could we really make an ultimate

4785
03:26:20,879 --> 03:26:25,238
plant for a control like controlled

4786
03:26:22,840 --> 03:26:28,398
environment that may do very well in low

4787
03:26:25,238 --> 03:26:30,719
light significantly fewer photons to get

4788
03:26:28,398 --> 03:26:33,159
the same output because all of the

4789
03:26:30,719 --> 03:26:36,639
developmental channels were primed I'm

4790
03:26:33,159 --> 03:26:38,478
kind of a a old school um disciple of

4791
03:26:36,639 --> 03:26:40,719
Fritz went I really believe that yeah

4792
03:26:38,478 --> 03:26:42,799
photosynthesis is important but setting

4793
03:26:40,719 --> 03:26:46,079
the stage for photosynthesis is even

4794
03:26:42,799 --> 03:26:47,840
more important and getting the plant to

4795
03:26:46,079 --> 03:26:50,039
uh have a morphology that's more

4796
03:26:47,840 --> 03:26:51,840
conducive to handle the incoming light

4797
03:26:50,040 --> 03:26:53,319
is is even better how do you make a

4798
03:26:51,840 --> 03:26:55,000
bigger antenna that kind of thing and

4799
03:26:53,318 --> 03:26:58,519
that's how we can maybe be able to grow

4800
03:26:55,000 --> 03:26:59,639
plants with fewer with less light energy

4801
03:26:58,520 --> 03:27:02,720
uh coming

4802
03:26:59,639 --> 03:27:04,760
in and so this this is an example of how

4803
03:27:02,719 --> 03:27:06,159
this works and this panel over here is

4804
03:27:04,760 --> 03:27:08,040
much better these two are the same I

4805
03:27:06,159 --> 03:27:10,039
don't know how that happened over here

4806
03:27:08,040 --> 03:27:12,680
it gives you an idea of butter Kings

4807
03:27:10,040 --> 03:27:14,840
both grown under dim blue light this one

4808
03:27:12,680 --> 03:27:17,398
very very hyper sensitive to light and

4809
03:27:14,840 --> 03:27:18,960
this one very hypos sensitive to light

4810
03:27:17,398 --> 03:27:22,119
if I showed you dark grown they'd look

4811
03:27:18,959 --> 03:27:24,599
much more like this one here so there is

4812
03:27:22,120 --> 03:27:27,399
just just inherent variation that you

4813
03:27:24,600 --> 03:27:28,760
see across lettuce and we're currently

4814
03:27:27,398 --> 03:27:30,159
putting together a paper where we've

4815
03:27:28,760 --> 03:27:31,719
looked at over 100 different lettuce

4816
03:27:30,159 --> 03:27:34,000
varieties under different spectral

4817
03:27:31,719 --> 03:27:36,559
conditions and you see this massive

4818
03:27:34,000 --> 03:27:38,238
variation that's there that tells us a

4819
03:27:36,559 --> 03:27:40,600
little bit about how it will respond to

4820
03:27:38,238 --> 03:27:42,959
the light environment we also have some

4821
03:27:40,600 --> 03:27:45,520
hints and I'll show you one in a minute

4822
03:27:42,959 --> 03:27:47,799
about how what we see in a Seedling does

4823
03:27:45,520 --> 03:27:50,680
Translate to more

4824
03:27:47,799 --> 03:27:53,599
mature uh more mature plants as they

4825
03:27:50,680 --> 03:27:55,760
grow so there's this huge variety huge

4826
03:27:53,600 --> 03:27:57,159
variation that we can exploit when we

4827
03:27:55,760 --> 03:27:59,920
look at this and I'll show you one

4828
03:27:57,159 --> 03:28:01,398
really nice example um Cade Cooper is an

4829
03:27:59,920 --> 03:28:03,639
undergraduate in the lab he does a

4830
03:28:01,398 --> 03:28:05,478
really really nice job so down here on

4831
03:28:03,639 --> 03:28:08,358
the bottom we have just regular oak leaf

4832
03:28:05,478 --> 03:28:09,879
lettuce grown under red light and blue

4833
03:28:08,359 --> 03:28:11,840
light and white light and I didn't put

4834
03:28:09,879 --> 03:28:14,438
how much it's 50 micromoles per meter

4835
03:28:11,840 --> 03:28:17,159
squar per second for those of you who

4836
03:28:14,439 --> 03:28:20,559
enjoy that stuff so just kind of about

4837
03:28:17,159 --> 03:28:23,600
three times room light and if you look

4838
03:28:20,559 --> 03:28:26,039
at this Tio leaf accession that uh that

4839
03:28:23,600 --> 03:28:27,800
that is available you see it looks

4840
03:28:26,040 --> 03:28:29,439
doesn't quite expand the same way under

4841
03:28:27,799 --> 03:28:32,119
white looks about the same under blue

4842
03:28:29,439 --> 03:28:34,079
and under red has very long hypoc codal

4843
03:28:32,120 --> 03:28:37,319
and very small

4844
03:28:34,079 --> 03:28:38,840
Cales almost like it's not seeing light

4845
03:28:37,318 --> 03:28:41,959
it looks a lot like those dark grown

4846
03:28:38,840 --> 03:28:44,199
arabidopsis sea lights so what this is

4847
03:28:41,959 --> 03:28:47,358
telling us perhaps is that when you're

4848
03:28:44,199 --> 03:28:49,479
not seeing red it's signaling a

4849
03:28:47,359 --> 03:28:51,439
deficiency in the in the ability to

4850
03:28:49,478 --> 03:28:53,959
transduce red light signals through

4851
03:28:51,439 --> 03:28:56,318
phytochrome b one of the red light

4852
03:28:53,959 --> 03:28:58,438
sensors and that's uh it's consistent

4853
03:28:56,318 --> 03:29:02,039
with a lesion in phytochrome be

4854
03:28:58,439 --> 03:29:05,159
signaling what's really cool about that

4855
03:29:02,040 --> 03:29:08,080
is that we also know phytochrome B has

4856
03:29:05,159 --> 03:29:12,159
some other problems it also shows a

4857
03:29:08,079 --> 03:29:14,359
little hint or hypersensitivity to shade

4858
03:29:12,159 --> 03:29:16,879
so shade avoidance responses are when

4859
03:29:14,359 --> 03:29:19,600
you move a plant from Full sunlight into

4860
03:29:16,879 --> 03:29:21,639
shade the Spectrum changes you see a

4861
03:29:19,600 --> 03:29:24,318
inversion of the red to far red ratio

4862
03:29:21,639 --> 03:29:25,920
you have much more far red than red and

4863
03:29:24,318 --> 03:29:29,079
also a significant amount of green to

4864
03:29:25,920 --> 03:29:31,159
red green to blue and that shift causes

4865
03:29:29,079 --> 03:29:33,159
plants to take on a shaded phenotype so

4866
03:29:31,159 --> 03:29:35,318
that rosette plant that typically is

4867
03:29:33,159 --> 03:29:38,039
flat on the ground will begin to have

4868
03:29:35,318 --> 03:29:40,359
exaggerations in leaf inclination and

4869
03:29:38,040 --> 03:29:42,600
leaf expansion so it tries to reach

4870
03:29:40,359 --> 03:29:44,840
above its neighbors the sensing that

4871
03:29:42,600 --> 03:29:46,680
it's it's close to has close proximity

4872
03:29:44,840 --> 03:29:49,318
to neighbors or maybe being under a

4873
03:29:46,680 --> 03:29:53,000
canopy so those morphological changes

4874
03:29:49,318 --> 03:29:55,600
occur to uh help it get up above so if

4875
03:29:53,000 --> 03:29:58,120
this is a fighter Chrome B mutant we

4876
03:29:55,600 --> 03:30:01,238
would expect it to have that same sort

4877
03:29:58,120 --> 03:30:03,600
of U exaggerated rosette

4878
03:30:01,238 --> 03:30:06,600
phenotype and we would expect expect it

4879
03:30:03,600 --> 03:30:08,880
to be extremely exaggerated if we change

4880
03:30:06,600 --> 03:30:10,279
the red to far red ratio and that's

4881
03:30:08,879 --> 03:30:12,559
exactly what we

4882
03:30:10,279 --> 03:30:16,479
see those were the quantitative data for

4883
03:30:12,559 --> 03:30:18,879
the previous things so here here is um

4884
03:30:16,478 --> 03:30:21,079
uh o regular oak leaf lettuce just in

4885
03:30:18,879 --> 03:30:24,159
red with a very strong well an even red

4886
03:30:21,079 --> 03:30:26,039
to far red ratio here's another uh type

4887
03:30:24,159 --> 03:30:27,119
of lettuce red the far and here's that

4888
03:30:26,040 --> 03:30:30,720
Thai Oak

4889
03:30:27,120 --> 03:30:34,040
Leaf and as predicted it has that

4890
03:30:30,719 --> 03:30:37,198
exaggerated shade stress

4891
03:30:34,040 --> 03:30:39,560
phenotype even though uh it has plenty

4892
03:30:37,199 --> 03:30:41,279
of uh red light it doesn't appear to be

4893
03:30:39,559 --> 03:30:43,398
in the shade it thinks it is in the

4894
03:30:41,279 --> 03:30:47,040
shape because its photos sensors are out

4895
03:30:43,398 --> 03:30:49,000
of whack um if we Elevate the far red

4896
03:30:47,040 --> 03:30:51,239
and decrease well keep if we change the

4897
03:30:49,000 --> 03:30:53,000
red to far red ratio to favor fire red

4898
03:30:51,238 --> 03:30:55,559
we see that exaggeration in the other

4899
03:30:53,000 --> 03:30:58,719
varieties in extreme exaggeration over

4900
03:30:55,559 --> 03:31:00,639
here so this was kind of a uh this was

4901
03:30:58,719 --> 03:31:02,438
again was consistent with the idea that

4902
03:31:00,639 --> 03:31:04,519
we could look at seedlings and begin to

4903
03:31:02,439 --> 03:31:05,639
make predictions about how mature plants

4904
03:31:04,520 --> 03:31:08,800
would

4905
03:31:05,639 --> 03:31:11,760
grow the funny part about this funny the

4906
03:31:08,799 --> 03:31:14,198
the interesting part about this is that

4907
03:31:11,760 --> 03:31:16,159
uh we we went back to say what's going

4908
03:31:14,199 --> 03:31:17,880
on with this Thao leaf lettuce what we

4909
03:31:16,159 --> 03:31:19,959
know about it where does it come from

4910
03:31:17,879 --> 03:31:21,799
why was it selected and there's very

4911
03:31:19,959 --> 03:31:24,238
little information known because really

4912
03:31:21,799 --> 03:31:27,799
only a couple places sell it but it

4913
03:31:24,238 --> 03:31:31,520
turns out oh before I get to that sorry

4914
03:31:27,799 --> 03:31:33,559
uh it turns out that 5B phytochrome B

4915
03:31:31,520 --> 03:31:35,479
where we saw the lesion in in red light

4916
03:31:33,559 --> 03:31:39,760
sensitivities this is a rabid opsis

4917
03:31:35,478 --> 03:31:41,840
under red light wild type and 5B mutant

4918
03:31:39,760 --> 03:31:44,800
this looks a lot like that tyo leaf

4919
03:31:41,840 --> 03:31:46,880
seedling under red light and it turns

4920
03:31:44,799 --> 03:31:49,679
out phytochrome B is thermal

4921
03:31:46,879 --> 03:31:52,599
sensor it helps with with

4922
03:31:49,680 --> 03:31:56,600
constraining the response to heat on

4923
03:31:52,600 --> 03:31:59,359
warm nights so phytochrome B is working

4924
03:31:56,600 --> 03:32:02,800
uh presumably to tailor plant responses

4925
03:31:59,359 --> 03:32:04,479
to heat and number of papers came out in

4926
03:32:02,799 --> 03:32:08,438
science and other places that really

4927
03:32:04,478 --> 03:32:12,079
show this very well and so we may

4928
03:32:08,439 --> 03:32:16,479
predict that Thai Oak Leaf selected for

4929
03:32:12,079 --> 03:32:19,238
a long hypoc cotle may be more um

4930
03:32:16,478 --> 03:32:21,719
amenable to growing in warm conditions

4931
03:32:19,238 --> 03:32:23,639
especially warm nights like we have in

4932
03:32:21,719 --> 03:32:27,238
Florida like we might have in a

4933
03:32:23,639 --> 03:32:29,039
controlled environment right so um it

4934
03:32:27,238 --> 03:32:30,639
turns out that if you go back and look

4935
03:32:29,040 --> 03:32:34,000
at why was this thing selected where did

4936
03:32:30,639 --> 03:32:35,840
it come from who did this um High oak

4937
03:32:34,000 --> 03:32:39,439
leaf lettuce loose leaf lettuce here it

4938
03:32:35,840 --> 03:32:41,279
says um uh grows pretty fast but

4939
03:32:39,439 --> 03:32:44,159
excellent quality lettuce under high

4940
03:32:41,279 --> 03:32:45,840
heat a favorite uh resembles Oak Leaf

4941
03:32:44,159 --> 03:32:48,920
but with larger more tender and more

4942
03:32:45,840 --> 03:32:51,840
oper right leaves so all of these things

4943
03:32:48,920 --> 03:32:53,960
that we figured out backwards by looking

4944
03:32:51,840 --> 03:32:56,719
at seedlings and analyzing Behavior were

4945
03:32:53,959 --> 03:32:59,639
things that they already knew and it was

4946
03:32:56,719 --> 03:33:02,198
the basis of selection for this variety

4947
03:32:59,639 --> 03:33:03,639
so it really validated our approach and

4948
03:33:02,199 --> 03:33:05,159
if we would have just paid attention to

4949
03:33:03,639 --> 03:33:07,000
the website we ordered the seeds from we

4950
03:33:05,159 --> 03:33:09,439
could have saved ourselves a lot of

4951
03:33:07,000 --> 03:33:11,359
time but it but it validates the

4952
03:33:09,439 --> 03:33:12,920
approach it says that we can use

4953
03:33:11,359 --> 03:33:15,840
phenotypes to potentially learn

4954
03:33:12,920 --> 03:33:17,799
something about the uh long-term growth

4955
03:33:15,840 --> 03:33:20,040
and developmental characteristics of a

4956
03:33:17,799 --> 03:33:21,920
crop plant and the reason this gets

4957
03:33:20,040 --> 03:33:24,120
exciting is because in

4958
03:33:21,920 --> 03:33:26,960
Florida lettuce is a significant

4959
03:33:24,120 --> 03:33:28,800
industry we grow lettuce in the winter

4960
03:33:26,959 --> 03:33:31,759
the problem is when it gets warm some

4961
03:33:28,799 --> 03:33:32,599
things happen we get bolting and uh and

4962
03:33:31,760 --> 03:33:34,639
poor

4963
03:33:32,600 --> 03:33:36,880
growth here you have a lettuce that's

4964
03:33:34,639 --> 03:33:37,680
heat tolerant and shows moderately slow

4965
03:33:36,879 --> 03:33:40,358
to

4966
03:33:37,680 --> 03:33:42,960
bold so what this suggests is that if we

4967
03:33:40,359 --> 03:33:45,318
want to accelerate lettuce breeding for

4968
03:33:42,959 --> 03:33:46,759
Florida we could potentially be growing

4969
03:33:45,318 --> 03:33:49,680
them under red light looking at

4970
03:33:46,760 --> 03:33:51,920
seedlings and automating that process

4971
03:33:49,680 --> 03:33:53,639
watching seedlings grow through time and

4972
03:33:51,920 --> 03:33:56,079
finding the ones that grow fast through

4973
03:33:53,639 --> 03:33:58,119
red light and when we make crosses

4974
03:33:56,079 --> 03:34:00,439
between heat tolerant varieties and

4975
03:33:58,120 --> 03:34:03,560
maybe those that are not look using the

4976
03:34:00,439 --> 03:34:05,520
phytochrome B deficiency as a way to

4977
03:34:03,559 --> 03:34:07,238
Signal which ones may give us better

4978
03:34:05,520 --> 03:34:09,439
ability to grow in the field then we can

4979
03:34:07,238 --> 03:34:11,439
test that and that's where we are right

4980
03:34:09,439 --> 03:34:13,639
now we're currently validating a number

4981
03:34:11,439 --> 03:34:16,880
of varieties and a number of crosses to

4982
03:34:13,639 --> 03:34:19,599
see see if that hypothesis is ported

4983
03:34:16,879 --> 03:34:21,398
pretty cool stuff and and the big deal

4984
03:34:19,600 --> 03:34:22,880
with that is that we aren't just

4985
03:34:21,398 --> 03:34:25,799
constrained to lettuce this is

4986
03:34:22,879 --> 03:34:28,278
phytochrome B this is a this is a a

4987
03:34:25,799 --> 03:34:30,119
photos sensor that's ubiquitous and

4988
03:34:28,279 --> 03:34:34,000
could we potentially be looking at any

4989
03:34:30,120 --> 03:34:36,640
particular seedling to identify heat um

4990
03:34:34,000 --> 03:34:40,000
insensitive or maybe better uh heat

4991
03:34:36,639 --> 03:34:42,478
coping varieties by looking at uh the

4992
03:34:40,000 --> 03:34:43,279
seedlings which don't grow short under

4993
03:34:42,478 --> 03:34:45,840
red

4994
03:34:43,279 --> 03:34:47,720
light and uh and then of course what

4995
03:34:45,840 --> 03:34:49,520
does that say in the long term about

4996
03:34:47,719 --> 03:34:51,879
flowering and productivity there's other

4997
03:34:49,520 --> 03:34:53,520
caveats of course some things we don't

4998
03:34:51,879 --> 03:34:55,639
want to flower some things we don't want

4999
03:34:53,520 --> 03:34:57,720
to bold other things is pretty important

5000
03:34:55,639 --> 03:35:00,519
so it it's going to depend on the

5001
03:34:57,719 --> 03:35:02,318
specific crop but it goes to an

5002
03:35:00,520 --> 03:35:04,520
interesting idea that we can use a

5003
03:35:02,318 --> 03:35:07,000
Seedling to tell us about energy

5004
03:35:04,520 --> 03:35:08,319
consumption and right now especially as

5005
03:35:07,000 --> 03:35:10,719
climates are changing and things are

5006
03:35:08,318 --> 03:35:12,439
getting warmer the vegetative crops like

5007
03:35:10,719 --> 03:35:14,599
your Basils and your lettuce and those

5008
03:35:12,439 --> 03:35:18,040
things if we can look at the seedling

5009
03:35:14,600 --> 03:35:19,680
level to begin to make selections maybe

5010
03:35:18,040 --> 03:35:23,439
can go a lot

5011
03:35:19,680 --> 03:35:26,000
faster and the other point on this is um

5012
03:35:23,439 --> 03:35:28,199
in a controlled environment some of the

5013
03:35:26,000 --> 03:35:30,398
big expenses of course are energy

5014
03:35:28,199 --> 03:35:33,199
something like at least a third is some

5015
03:35:30,398 --> 03:35:35,599
estimate as high as 60% of the budget of

5016
03:35:33,199 --> 03:35:37,199
a of a closed controlled environment is

5017
03:35:35,600 --> 03:35:39,840
in lighting it and then getting rid of

5018
03:35:37,199 --> 03:35:41,800
the heat from the light and if you could

5019
03:35:39,840 --> 03:35:43,680
keep things a couple degrees warmer by

5020
03:35:41,799 --> 03:35:46,679
growing crops which maybe grow a little

5021
03:35:43,680 --> 03:35:49,639
bit faster but also um are insensitive

5022
03:35:46,680 --> 03:35:51,880
to the Heat or better able to handle the

5023
03:35:49,639 --> 03:35:53,599
heat perhaps this could be another

5024
03:35:51,879 --> 03:35:55,679
solution for the controlled environment

5025
03:35:53,600 --> 03:35:57,760
failure

5026
03:35:55,680 --> 03:35:59,920
problem the other thing that's really

5027
03:35:57,760 --> 03:36:01,600
important is I think this idea of

5028
03:35:59,920 --> 03:36:03,879
controlled environments another

5029
03:36:01,600 --> 03:36:05,840
opportunity in the crisis is can't we

5030
03:36:03,879 --> 03:36:08,238
breed for plasticity and this is another

5031
03:36:05,840 --> 03:36:10,359
neat one that that that uh that we

5032
03:36:08,238 --> 03:36:12,000
worked on was examining lettuce

5033
03:36:10,359 --> 03:36:15,040
varieties for those that could give us

5034
03:36:12,000 --> 03:36:17,120
the widest array of phenotypes from one

5035
03:36:15,040 --> 03:36:18,760
common Gene genotypes so we talked

5036
03:36:17,120 --> 03:36:21,359
before about the idea of genetics and

5037
03:36:18,760 --> 03:36:22,760
environment could we put the same set of

5038
03:36:21,359 --> 03:36:25,318
genetics in two separate environments

5039
03:36:22,760 --> 03:36:27,159
and get two different products so in

5040
03:36:25,318 --> 03:36:28,478
other words a grower would only have to

5041
03:36:27,159 --> 03:36:31,398
buy one set of

5042
03:36:28,478 --> 03:36:34,238
seeds understand the management around

5043
03:36:31,398 --> 03:36:35,879
one set of seeds and then test the

5044
03:36:34,238 --> 03:36:38,760
market and say what do you want purple

5045
03:36:35,879 --> 03:36:40,238
or green and then push the switch that

5046
03:36:38,760 --> 03:36:42,719
gives you purple or

5047
03:36:40,238 --> 03:36:44,559
green it's a it's another aspect that

5048
03:36:42,719 --> 03:36:46,799
hasn't been exploited yet by controlled

5049
03:36:44,559 --> 03:36:48,519
environment agriculture but an important

5050
03:36:46,799 --> 03:36:50,679
part of Plant Whispering that I think

5051
03:36:48,520 --> 03:36:52,800
that that uh is something that should be

5052
03:36:50,680 --> 03:36:56,559
adopted I think the idea that can we

5053
03:36:52,799 --> 03:36:59,238
grow of a variety of plants from start

5054
03:36:56,559 --> 03:37:02,000
one set of plants and then divide that

5055
03:36:59,238 --> 03:37:05,478
up based upon the demand from the from

5056
03:37:02,000 --> 03:37:07,279
the market um and I don't pay attention

5057
03:37:05,478 --> 03:37:09,559
to this onoff stuff yet I'll get to that

5058
03:37:07,279 --> 03:37:11,000
in a minute but this is one variety of

5059
03:37:09,559 --> 03:37:12,920
lettuce that's already exists where we

5060
03:37:11,000 --> 03:37:15,959
can make three very distinct products

5061
03:37:12,920 --> 03:37:18,760
just by how much we turn the light on

5062
03:37:15,959 --> 03:37:21,679
off so we're investing

5063
03:37:18,760 --> 03:37:26,159
Darkness to change the product and

5064
03:37:21,680 --> 03:37:28,960
potentially put more kilograms per bag

5065
03:37:26,159 --> 03:37:32,920
or well more more biomass per bag by

5066
03:37:28,959 --> 03:37:35,438
investing Less in energy so as a grower

5067
03:37:32,920 --> 03:37:37,398
this is a good thing you're you're

5068
03:37:35,439 --> 03:37:39,920
costing me less money but I'm getting a

5069
03:37:37,398 --> 03:37:41,478
more valuable product and so maybe

5070
03:37:39,920 --> 03:37:43,199
that's another way that we need to think

5071
03:37:41,478 --> 03:37:45,760
about this and we'll we'll we'll come

5072
03:37:43,199 --> 03:37:48,000
back to this in a minute

5073
03:37:45,760 --> 03:37:50,880
um this next picture I show I'll show

5074
03:37:48,000 --> 03:37:52,159
you shows you how when we take one

5075
03:37:50,879 --> 03:37:54,559
variety of lettuce that we've been

5076
03:37:52,159 --> 03:37:56,959
working with we can place it into six

5077
03:37:54,559 --> 03:37:58,278
different light conditions and generate

5078
03:37:56,959 --> 03:38:00,599
six different

5079
03:37:58,279 --> 03:38:02,560
products so that's six different

5080
03:38:00,600 --> 03:38:05,680
products that are coming from one set of

5081
03:38:02,559 --> 03:38:08,398
genetics so one G and six

5082
03:38:05,680 --> 03:38:10,199
E's taking that one set of G and pulling

5083
03:38:08,398 --> 03:38:12,680
it in six different directions to make

5084
03:38:10,199 --> 03:38:14,319
six different products and it's another

5085
03:38:12,680 --> 03:38:16,720
way to think about how we can better

5086
03:38:14,318 --> 03:38:19,278
exploit controlled envir

5087
03:38:16,719 --> 03:38:21,959
IRS and right now we're looking at herbs

5088
03:38:19,279 --> 03:38:24,000
we're doing a lot with this because

5089
03:38:21,959 --> 03:38:25,358
we've done some interesting preliminary

5090
03:38:24,000 --> 03:38:26,840
data we have some interesting

5091
03:38:25,359 --> 03:38:29,399
preliminary data on the flavors and

5092
03:38:26,840 --> 03:38:31,478
Aromas of basil and shown that when we

5093
03:38:29,398 --> 03:38:33,238
put it into a controlled environment of

5094
03:38:31,478 --> 03:38:36,198
different spectral quality we can

5095
03:38:33,238 --> 03:38:39,398
radically shift the components that lead

5096
03:38:36,199 --> 03:38:40,680
to liking and not liking and this is old

5097
03:38:39,398 --> 03:38:43,198
published work at this point and the

5098
03:38:40,680 --> 03:38:44,760
thing I want you to take home um so what

5099
03:38:43,199 --> 03:38:47,000
we're looking at here the major classes

5100
03:38:44,760 --> 03:38:49,478
of flavor compounds and then how they

5101
03:38:47,000 --> 03:38:52,760
look in a greenhouse so you're looking

5102
03:38:49,478 --> 03:38:55,879
at uh less stuff and more stuff as you

5103
03:38:52,760 --> 03:38:59,159
go from green to to purple um less of

5104
03:38:55,879 --> 03:39:01,438
this and uh and then shifting as we go

5105
03:38:59,159 --> 03:39:03,719
up into more complicated narrow band

5106
03:39:01,439 --> 03:39:06,318
with environments and it really shows

5107
03:39:03,719 --> 03:39:08,079
that there's a tremendous opportunity to

5108
03:39:06,318 --> 03:39:12,920
just as you're pulling colors in that

5109
03:39:08,079 --> 03:39:15,680
salad be able to pull at the molecular

5110
03:39:12,920 --> 03:39:19,120
circuitry that underlies the produ of

5111
03:39:15,680 --> 03:39:21,120
flavor and Aroma compounds and um what

5112
03:39:19,120 --> 03:39:22,840
was particularly interesting about this

5113
03:39:21,120 --> 03:39:24,600
that we learned something really cool

5114
03:39:22,840 --> 03:39:27,439
about this when I teach my plant

5115
03:39:24,600 --> 03:39:30,640
physiology classes I talk about how

5116
03:39:27,439 --> 03:39:32,398
plants adapt to a new environment how

5117
03:39:30,639 --> 03:39:35,639
that's why they survive that they have

5118
03:39:32,398 --> 03:39:37,719
to be uh agile and and adapt to the new

5119
03:39:35,639 --> 03:39:40,760
ambient environment that's why they do

5120
03:39:37,719 --> 03:39:42,519
what they do we we have really nice data

5121
03:39:40,760 --> 03:39:44,800
that show that once you're born in the

5122
03:39:42,520 --> 03:39:46,359
greenhouse under a full solar Spectrum

5123
03:39:44,799 --> 03:39:48,920
you remember that you were born under a

5124
03:39:46,359 --> 03:39:51,318
full solar Spectrum even if we do funny

5125
03:39:48,920 --> 03:39:53,639
things to you later and if you were born

5126
03:39:51,318 --> 03:39:55,478
under LEDs and an electronic canopy of

5127
03:39:53,639 --> 03:39:57,760
narrow bandwith light and we move you to

5128
03:39:55,478 --> 03:40:01,238
the greenhouse you remember that you

5129
03:39:57,760 --> 03:40:03,359
were born under funny lights and this is

5130
03:40:01,238 --> 03:40:05,398
this shows that maybe we need to think a

5131
03:40:03,359 --> 03:40:07,399
little bit more about the way we treat

5132
03:40:05,398 --> 03:40:09,159
plants early and how we can shift them

5133
03:40:07,398 --> 03:40:11,159
to different environments later on

5134
03:40:09,159 --> 03:40:13,000
there's a lot more layers to controlled

5135
03:40:11,159 --> 03:40:16,039
environments than simply putting them

5136
03:40:13,000 --> 03:40:18,359
under a pink static illumination

5137
03:40:16,040 --> 03:40:20,040
and I think that's another trick that as

5138
03:40:18,359 --> 03:40:22,559
we move forward and become more

5139
03:40:20,040 --> 03:40:24,279
sophisticated in our treatments may make

5140
03:40:22,559 --> 03:40:26,719
the idea of controlled environment

5141
03:40:24,279 --> 03:40:29,600
agriculture increasingly more

5142
03:40:26,719 --> 03:40:31,879
viable so how do we um and then this is

5143
03:40:29,600 --> 03:40:34,559
always the part that I like the best how

5144
03:40:31,879 --> 03:40:37,278
do we do something weird how do we break

5145
03:40:34,559 --> 03:40:38,840
biology by or or enhance biology by

5146
03:40:37,279 --> 03:40:41,399
doing something that nature never

5147
03:40:38,840 --> 03:40:45,520
intended by taking something that

5148
03:40:41,398 --> 03:40:48,000
evolved under a uh uh a on an evolving

5149
03:40:45,520 --> 03:40:50,399
planet of dark and light of a solar

5150
03:40:48,000 --> 03:40:51,959
Spectrum that's complete and now we

5151
03:40:50,398 --> 03:40:54,639
throw it into an environment that could

5152
03:40:51,959 --> 03:40:57,238
never happen on Earth could we get

5153
03:40:54,639 --> 03:40:59,119
something beneficial or better yet could

5154
03:40:57,238 --> 03:41:01,879
we learn something that could inform the

5155
03:40:59,120 --> 03:41:04,000
development of new practices that allow

5156
03:41:01,879 --> 03:41:06,278
us to save energy and and this is kind

5157
03:41:04,000 --> 03:41:08,120
of neat I I think this is kind of fun

5158
03:41:06,279 --> 03:41:10,319
and it's working well so what if we were

5159
03:41:08,120 --> 03:41:12,520
to take plants and instead of breaking

5160
03:41:10,318 --> 03:41:15,278
up the day into 12 hours of dark and 12

5161
03:41:12,520 --> 03:41:17,159
hours of light we said let's give them

5162
03:41:15,279 --> 03:41:19,120
eight hours of dark eight hours of light

5163
03:41:17,159 --> 03:41:21,039
three times and six hours of dark six

5164
03:41:19,120 --> 03:41:23,079
hours of light 10 minutes of dark 10

5165
03:41:21,040 --> 03:41:26,800
minutes of light what if we broke up the

5166
03:41:23,079 --> 03:41:28,639
day like that and uh we have some

5167
03:41:26,799 --> 03:41:31,519
specialized equipment that's homemade

5168
03:41:28,639 --> 03:41:33,278
that does this and what's really neat

5169
03:41:31,520 --> 03:41:34,960
about this and what you might be

5170
03:41:33,279 --> 03:41:36,640
thinking is well faulty you're an idiot

5171
03:41:34,959 --> 03:41:38,679
because it's the same number of photons

5172
03:41:36,639 --> 03:41:41,760
in both cases the same amount of energy

5173
03:41:38,680 --> 03:41:43,318
still 12 hours on 12 hours off and

5174
03:41:41,760 --> 03:41:46,199
you're right but I'll show you what how

5175
03:41:43,318 --> 03:41:49,158
this gets really cool so if we look at

5176
03:41:46,199 --> 03:41:52,079
let's just look at hypoc long this is um

5177
03:41:49,158 --> 03:41:54,079
these are seedlings of different uh crop

5178
03:41:52,079 --> 03:41:56,359
plants or seedlings of kale turn up and

5179
03:41:54,079 --> 03:41:59,039
beat all of which are used as commercial

5180
03:41:56,359 --> 03:42:01,040
sprouts and let's stay with hypoc cotal

5181
03:41:59,040 --> 03:42:03,279
elongation what you see here is that if

5182
03:42:01,040 --> 03:42:04,880
we go 12 hours on 12 hours off you see

5183
03:42:03,279 --> 03:42:07,000
this nice suppression of hypoc cotal

5184
03:42:04,879 --> 03:42:09,198
elongation that says you're getting a

5185
03:42:07,000 --> 03:42:12,359
lot of integration of light

5186
03:42:09,199 --> 03:42:15,720
signals and if you start to mess with

5187
03:42:12,359 --> 03:42:17,359
this we'll stay up here in tail as you

5188
03:42:15,719 --> 03:42:20,719
start making that interval shorter and

5189
03:42:17,359 --> 03:42:23,680
shorter um the plant appears to be more

5190
03:42:20,719 --> 03:42:27,039
dark like so it's getting the same

5191
03:42:23,680 --> 03:42:29,079
number of photons but as you break it up

5192
03:42:27,040 --> 03:42:31,040
means you make the photosyn the

5193
03:42:29,079 --> 03:42:34,158
photomorphogenic integration of those

5194
03:42:31,040 --> 03:42:37,560
signals less

5195
03:42:34,158 --> 03:42:39,559
correct until you get down into the 5

5196
03:42:37,559 --> 03:42:41,439
Seconds on 5 Seconds off range so you

5197
03:42:39,559 --> 03:42:43,198
start getting into the range down here

5198
03:42:41,439 --> 03:42:44,639
you're actually doing a really nice job

5199
03:42:43,199 --> 03:42:47,800
when you start getting in the 5 Seconds

5200
03:42:44,639 --> 03:42:50,119
on five seconds off

5201
03:42:47,799 --> 03:42:52,158
and that's kind of interesting so all of

5202
03:42:50,120 --> 03:42:54,239
a sudden the plant is thinking that it's

5203
03:42:52,158 --> 03:42:57,359
under constant illumination

5204
03:42:54,238 --> 03:42:59,959
again all right so so let's just keep

5205
03:42:57,359 --> 03:43:02,439
that in mind TW the 12 hours on and off

5206
03:42:59,959 --> 03:43:04,278
and the and the five seconds on and off

5207
03:43:02,439 --> 03:43:06,559
appear to be the same where the rest

5208
03:43:04,279 --> 03:43:08,720
aren't and we we wrote this paper well

5209
03:43:06,559 --> 03:43:10,198
there's more to it coming up but we

5210
03:43:08,719 --> 03:43:11,519
wrote this paper it's all done and the

5211
03:43:10,199 --> 03:43:14,040
student who was in my lab he was an

5212
03:43:11,520 --> 03:43:16,199
undergraduate he was awesome and he

5213
03:43:14,040 --> 03:43:19,840
comes to me and says oh yeah hey by the

5214
03:43:16,199 --> 03:43:21,279
way um this is all good but um somebody

5215
03:43:19,840 --> 03:43:23,760
already did

5216
03:43:21,279 --> 03:43:27,399
this and he's actually a professor of

5217
03:43:23,760 --> 03:43:29,760
vening and now he's he's good guy um he

5218
03:43:27,398 --> 03:43:31,439
uh he says somebody already did this and

5219
03:43:29,760 --> 03:43:33,639
it turns out that he went back in the

5220
03:43:31,439 --> 03:43:36,079
literature and found a paper from Garner

5221
03:43:33,639 --> 03:43:38,559
and Allard in

5222
03:43:36,079 --> 03:43:42,079
1931 where Garner and Allard did the

5223
03:43:38,559 --> 03:43:43,799
same damn thing only with um Cosmos and

5224
03:43:42,079 --> 03:43:46,600
uh some other Critter probably I don't

5225
03:43:43,799 --> 03:43:48,438
know something else Co Lark spur

5226
03:43:46,600 --> 03:43:49,880
whatever that is but the idea was as you

5227
03:43:48,439 --> 03:43:51,520
grew them under different intervals of

5228
03:43:49,879 --> 03:43:54,000
dark and light and I love these old

5229
03:43:51,520 --> 03:43:55,600
things Fritz went did a lot of this too

5230
03:43:54,000 --> 03:43:57,199
one you just put plants in funny

5231
03:43:55,600 --> 03:43:58,238
environments and saw what would happen

5232
03:43:57,199 --> 03:44:00,199
but here they were doing those

5233
03:43:58,238 --> 03:44:02,238
treatments 12 hours on and off one hour

5234
03:44:00,199 --> 03:44:03,760
not so good and down to 5 seconds on and

5235
03:44:02,238 --> 03:44:06,359
off it comes

5236
03:44:03,760 --> 03:44:08,960
back so it's like almost the same

5237
03:44:06,359 --> 03:44:11,559
experiments that that they did 80 years

5238
03:44:08,959 --> 03:44:13,919
previous and looked very similar to the

5239
03:44:11,559 --> 03:44:15,879
data that we got um on something like

5240
03:44:13,920 --> 03:44:17,879
kale and that's anthos accumulation

5241
03:44:15,879 --> 03:44:20,639
which could also be used as a marker of

5242
03:44:17,879 --> 03:44:23,358
photomorphogenic development so um the

5243
03:44:20,639 --> 03:44:24,840
coloration that we see in the stem uh

5244
03:44:23,359 --> 03:44:27,238
started high and it was really really

5245
03:44:24,840 --> 03:44:29,238
high after five five seconds on off okay

5246
03:44:27,238 --> 03:44:31,840
so now we go back to oh so why is this

5247
03:44:29,238 --> 03:44:34,920
happening why is why is short not

5248
03:44:31,840 --> 03:44:36,520
bothering the plant and what this shows

5249
03:44:34,920 --> 03:44:38,680
is the

5250
03:44:36,520 --> 03:44:41,199
complicated mechanism that's in trining

5251
03:44:38,680 --> 03:44:44,158
in circadian oscillator the internal

5252
03:44:41,199 --> 03:44:46,479
oscillator of the plant is what's

5253
03:44:44,158 --> 03:44:48,318
measuring that day length and reporting

5254
03:44:46,478 --> 03:44:50,438
to the nucleus to coordinate gene

5255
03:44:48,318 --> 03:44:52,760
expression so that gene expression is

5256
03:44:50,439 --> 03:44:54,600
appropriate and anticipating the next

5257
03:44:52,760 --> 03:44:57,398
light cycle after a certain period of

5258
03:44:54,600 --> 03:44:59,479
darkness and this been very well

5259
03:44:57,398 --> 03:45:02,000
dissected I think what's happening and

5260
03:44:59,478 --> 03:45:04,478
we're testing this now is that when we

5261
03:45:02,000 --> 03:45:06,559
give these short little pulses in the

5262
03:45:04,478 --> 03:45:09,198
beginning that seed to germinate it

5263
03:45:06,559 --> 03:45:10,879
never really conditions a clock the

5264
03:45:09,199 --> 03:45:13,560
oscillator never is moving in any

5265
03:45:10,879 --> 03:45:15,278
particular direction so we kind of are

5266
03:45:13,559 --> 03:45:17,398
bypassing the oscillator and just

5267
03:45:15,279 --> 03:45:21,439
running the plan strictly upon upon

5268
03:45:17,398 --> 03:45:23,719
input signals from the um small pulses

5269
03:45:21,439 --> 03:45:26,120
and that when you're at 12 hours on 12

5270
03:45:23,719 --> 03:45:28,039
hours off you're running a normal

5271
03:45:26,120 --> 03:45:30,680
daylight cycle just like you're on a

5272
03:45:28,040 --> 03:45:32,920
spinning Planet yet if you're doing 1

5273
03:45:30,680 --> 03:45:34,439
hour on one hour off it's unfavorable

5274
03:45:32,920 --> 03:45:37,000
because the oscillator starts then it

5275
03:45:34,439 --> 03:45:38,479
has to reset and so I think that's uh

5276
03:45:37,000 --> 03:45:40,158
why we're seeing what we're seeing and

5277
03:45:38,478 --> 03:45:43,278
we're testing that

5278
03:45:40,158 --> 03:45:45,799
hypothesis but going back to practical

5279
03:45:43,279 --> 03:45:48,560
application okay now this is where you

5280
03:45:45,799 --> 03:45:50,679
say B you're an idiot uh the um you're

5281
03:45:48,559 --> 03:45:52,719
still giving 12 hours of light a day

5282
03:45:50,680 --> 03:45:55,359
it's just breaking it into little pieces

5283
03:45:52,719 --> 03:45:59,679
how are you saving anyone any

5284
03:45:55,359 --> 03:46:02,559
energy okay so what if we were to do uh

5285
03:45:59,680 --> 03:46:04,600
5 seconds on 5 Seconds off okay still 12

5286
03:46:02,559 --> 03:46:07,478
hours a day of total illumination same

5287
03:46:04,600 --> 03:46:11,399
DLI Daily Light integral what if we did

5288
03:46:07,478 --> 03:46:13,519
5 seconds on six seconds off what if we

5289
03:46:11,398 --> 03:46:15,639
did 5 seconds on 10 seconds off 5

5290
03:46:13,520 --> 03:46:18,000
seconds on 20 seconds off

5291
03:46:15,639 --> 03:46:19,358
now you begin to see how this might work

5292
03:46:18,000 --> 03:46:21,000
because we're not perturbing the

5293
03:46:19,359 --> 03:46:23,040
oscillator yet we're providing light

5294
03:46:21,000 --> 03:46:24,238
energy for photosynthesis we're just

5295
03:46:23,040 --> 03:46:26,920
giving it in

5296
03:46:24,238 --> 03:46:30,279
packets every so many

5297
03:46:26,920 --> 03:46:32,359
seconds and the plant isn't perturbed

5298
03:46:30,279 --> 03:46:34,840
physiologically because the oscillator

5299
03:46:32,359 --> 03:46:36,880
can't really figure out what's going on

5300
03:46:34,840 --> 03:46:39,279
so this is a way in which which would

5301
03:46:36,879 --> 03:46:41,519
work great in maybe being able to save

5302
03:46:39,279 --> 03:46:44,600
some energy in a controlled environment

5303
03:46:41,520 --> 03:46:47,319
situation by pulsing the light and so

5304
03:46:44,600 --> 03:46:49,199
when did this it worked really well um

5305
03:46:47,318 --> 03:46:51,559
what if we stay on this end where we

5306
03:46:49,199 --> 03:46:54,439
look at kind of um blue red and far red

5307
03:46:51,559 --> 03:46:56,278
treatments is you could go 5 seconds on

5308
03:46:54,439 --> 03:46:58,279
5 Seconds off and show a nice short

5309
03:46:56,279 --> 03:47:00,800
seedling that's integrating this is

5310
03:46:58,279 --> 03:47:05,000
hypoc cotal elongation on this axis and

5311
03:47:00,799 --> 03:47:08,238
then this one is 5 10 20 40 160 seconds

5312
03:47:05,000 --> 03:47:10,158
between pules and what you see is that

5313
03:47:08,238 --> 03:47:12,680
whether you give 5 seconds on 5 Seconds

5314
03:47:10,158 --> 03:47:15,959
off or 10 seconds on 10 seconds off

5315
03:47:12,680 --> 03:47:17,520
doesn't matter and in some cases see uh

5316
03:47:15,959 --> 03:47:20,158
sustained integration and this is only

5317
03:47:17,520 --> 03:47:22,199
at One fluence Rate One light intensity

5318
03:47:20,158 --> 03:47:23,639
that as we increase the light intensity

5319
03:47:22,199 --> 03:47:27,359
we actually bring this out a little

5320
03:47:23,639 --> 03:47:32,000
further so what this says is that

5321
03:47:27,359 --> 03:47:34,120
the uh the ability to sustain a light

5322
03:47:32,000 --> 03:47:37,199
signal into a growth and development

5323
03:47:34,120 --> 03:47:39,359
response can be done in darkness if you

5324
03:47:37,199 --> 03:47:41,960
apply that light then you let it go in

5325
03:47:39,359 --> 03:47:44,120
darkness and uh and we've been able to

5326
03:47:41,959 --> 03:47:46,000
show that we've been able to get this

5327
03:47:44,120 --> 03:47:48,159
significantly out I mean we've been uh

5328
03:47:46,000 --> 03:47:50,079
probably 20 seconds stays about the same

5329
03:47:48,158 --> 03:47:52,478
when we use certain fluence rates of

5330
03:47:50,079 --> 03:47:54,920
light so this seems like a really

5331
03:47:52,478 --> 03:47:58,039
positive way to be able to control and

5332
03:47:54,920 --> 03:47:59,398
modulate the uh growth of seedlings or

5333
03:47:58,040 --> 03:48:01,640
any or plants in a controlled

5334
03:47:59,398 --> 03:48:04,238
environment the other thing we did which

5335
03:48:01,639 --> 03:48:06,278
I neglected to put in in the slides here

5336
03:48:04,238 --> 03:48:08,760
is we did this in a rabid

5337
03:48:06,279 --> 03:48:11,680
opsis and so when we did this in a rabid

5338
03:48:08,760 --> 03:48:13,719
opsis we were able to to test the

5339
03:48:11,680 --> 03:48:16,279
photomorphogenic mutants of a rabit

5340
03:48:13,719 --> 03:48:18,519
opsis and say what are the light sensors

5341
03:48:16,279 --> 03:48:20,040
that are contributing to the response

5342
03:48:18,520 --> 03:48:22,359
and what we were able to show is that

5343
03:48:20,040 --> 03:48:25,880
this is primarily a phytochrome a b and

5344
03:48:22,359 --> 03:48:28,520
phytochrome b and uh Cry 1 cryptochrome

5345
03:48:25,879 --> 03:48:30,238
1 meded response so it's responding to

5346
03:48:28,520 --> 03:48:32,680
blue red and far red portions of the

5347
03:48:30,238 --> 03:48:35,879
spectrum a lot like we see

5348
03:48:32,680 --> 03:48:39,120
here and so the way to think about this

5349
03:48:35,879 --> 03:48:41,839
is so what we were thinking about was

5350
03:48:39,120 --> 03:48:45,680
okay if we take away those receptors we

5351
03:48:41,840 --> 03:48:47,639
still we still see uh

5352
03:48:45,680 --> 03:48:50,639
we still see that there well we we still

5353
03:48:47,639 --> 03:48:53,599
we see that they return to the normal

5354
03:48:50,639 --> 03:48:56,079
size because of a lack of

5355
03:48:53,600 --> 03:48:57,840
inhibition but biology Works in two

5356
03:48:56,079 --> 03:49:00,039
directions usually when you look at

5357
03:48:57,840 --> 03:49:02,439
biology for every push you got a pull

5358
03:49:00,040 --> 03:49:04,199
right that for every inhibition you've

5359
03:49:02,439 --> 03:49:06,000
got something that's promoting and these

5360
03:49:04,199 --> 03:49:08,279
things kind of work against each other

5361
03:49:06,000 --> 03:49:09,799
we see this exquisitely in hormone

5362
03:49:08,279 --> 03:49:12,040
systems where positive and negative

5363
03:49:09,799 --> 03:49:13,959
Regulators work in concert together to

5364
03:49:12,040 --> 03:49:16,080
modulate the Precision of some sort of

5365
03:49:13,959 --> 03:49:18,119
output response

5366
03:49:16,079 --> 03:49:21,318
and in keeping with that idea we started

5367
03:49:18,120 --> 03:49:23,520
to think about what other ways might

5368
03:49:21,318 --> 03:49:27,760
there be a push back against this

5369
03:49:23,520 --> 03:49:29,560
process and so um this was a really cool

5370
03:49:27,760 --> 03:49:31,760
experiment that was done back by Shi

5371
03:49:29,559 --> 03:49:33,959
Shang um a couple years ago visiting

5372
03:49:31,760 --> 03:49:36,279
scientist it was just recently repeated

5373
03:49:33,959 --> 03:49:38,318
by an undergraduate in the lab and this

5374
03:49:36,279 --> 03:49:41,040
is the phototropin one mutant another

5375
03:49:38,318 --> 03:49:43,359
blue light receptor so when we do this

5376
03:49:41,040 --> 03:49:47,479
same experiment in the phototropin one

5377
03:49:43,359 --> 03:49:50,158
mutants we show that the light signal

5378
03:49:47,478 --> 03:49:53,920
and one interpretation may be that the

5379
03:49:50,158 --> 03:49:56,199
light signal is is sustained even out

5380
03:49:53,920 --> 03:49:59,120
past 40 seconds of darkness and still

5381
03:49:56,199 --> 03:50:00,960
even after 80 Seconds off you still see

5382
03:49:59,120 --> 03:50:04,199
sustained evidence that that light

5383
03:50:00,959 --> 03:50:06,599
signal is persisting so it's almost like

5384
03:50:04,199 --> 03:50:08,880
vot one is the system which is shutting

5385
03:50:06,600 --> 03:50:10,720
off the light input you've got some that

5386
03:50:08,879 --> 03:50:13,238
are stepping on the gas some that are

5387
03:50:10,719 --> 03:50:15,639
stepping on the brakes here we've taken

5388
03:50:13,238 --> 03:50:17,840
away the brakes

5389
03:50:15,639 --> 03:50:21,599
why that's important is is can you

5390
03:50:17,840 --> 03:50:24,398
imagine moving into a gene editing uh

5391
03:50:21,600 --> 03:50:28,238
Gene editing situation here could we

5392
03:50:24,398 --> 03:50:30,000
mutagenize fot one knock out fot one and

5393
03:50:28,238 --> 03:50:32,959
now be able to make plants that are even

5394
03:50:30,000 --> 03:50:35,559
better integrating light signals and if

5395
03:50:32,959 --> 03:50:38,119
you don't like genetic engineering and

5396
03:50:35,559 --> 03:50:39,920
crisper stuff what if you just looked

5397
03:50:38,120 --> 03:50:42,199
for the plants in your favorite crop

5398
03:50:39,920 --> 03:50:44,719
that didn't bend towards light when

5399
03:50:42,199 --> 03:50:47,520
mutagenized do those incorporate light

5400
03:50:44,719 --> 03:50:49,799
signals better and that's the hypothesis

5401
03:50:47,520 --> 03:50:51,560
we're testing right now so we're we're

5402
03:50:49,799 --> 03:50:54,519
looking at whereas these are driving it

5403
03:50:51,559 --> 03:50:56,398
Forward V one appears to be pushing back

5404
03:50:54,520 --> 03:50:58,158
and it doesn't seem consistent with vot

5405
03:50:56,398 --> 03:51:01,639
one's known

5406
03:50:58,158 --> 03:51:03,920
roles but no one's ever grown f one no

5407
03:51:01,639 --> 03:51:06,920
one's ever grown plants under a flashing

5408
03:51:03,920 --> 03:51:08,799
light at 5-second intervals before so

5409
03:51:06,920 --> 03:51:11,439
there's so the take-home message on all

5410
03:51:08,799 --> 03:51:13,559
of this is is that when we put plants in

5411
03:51:11,439 --> 03:51:15,840
a truly novel environment which is what

5412
03:51:13,559 --> 03:51:18,318
we're going to do in space

5413
03:51:15,840 --> 03:51:20,478
can we identify new trends and new ways

5414
03:51:18,318 --> 03:51:21,920
that may be able to be translated into

5415
03:51:20,478 --> 03:51:24,198
controlled environments here on the

5416
03:51:21,920 --> 03:51:26,879
earth and I think this is a really nice

5417
03:51:24,199 --> 03:51:28,520
example that you can do something that

5418
03:51:26,879 --> 03:51:32,158
maybe doesn't make a lot of sense on the

5419
03:51:28,520 --> 03:51:34,600
be on the on the outside but begin to uh

5420
03:51:32,158 --> 03:51:37,039
disclose new phenomenology that not only

5421
03:51:34,600 --> 03:51:40,640
define biology a little bit more

5422
03:51:37,040 --> 03:51:43,239
different also commercial implications

5423
03:51:40,639 --> 03:51:46,639
if it works because finally we can May

5424
03:51:43,238 --> 03:51:48,559
if we can grow plants in a in a um in a

5425
03:51:46,639 --> 03:51:50,238
controlled environment a close

5426
03:51:48,559 --> 03:51:53,519
controlled environment and only apply

5427
03:51:50,238 --> 03:51:55,119
the light signal once every 20 seconds

5428
03:51:53,520 --> 03:51:56,920
perhaps that has the ability to

5429
03:51:55,120 --> 03:51:58,199
translate into a viability in that

5430
03:51:56,920 --> 03:52:00,680
particular

5431
03:51:58,199 --> 03:52:02,880
industry so that was the really the new

5432
03:52:00,680 --> 03:52:05,079
ideas is can we come up with new

5433
03:52:02,879 --> 03:52:08,198
varieties by looking at light phenotypes

5434
03:52:05,079 --> 03:52:10,478
of seedlings that generate new varieties

5435
03:52:08,199 --> 03:52:12,239
that may be more amable to use in

5436
03:52:10,478 --> 03:52:15,119
controlled environments and can we come

5437
03:52:12,238 --> 03:52:18,198
up with funny ways to illuminate plants

5438
03:52:15,120 --> 03:52:21,399
that also give us uh new practices and

5439
03:52:18,199 --> 03:52:25,040
can we put the two together so can we

5440
03:52:21,398 --> 03:52:27,840
divide can we select for a plant that

5441
03:52:25,040 --> 03:52:30,159
does well in a completely foreign

5442
03:52:27,840 --> 03:52:32,960
environment and is that going to be a

5443
03:52:30,158 --> 03:52:34,920
way that we can uh add to food Security

5444
03:52:32,959 --> 03:52:36,839
in the future have more choices for

5445
03:52:34,920 --> 03:52:39,079
consumers in the industrialized world

5446
03:52:36,840 --> 03:52:41,158
and maybe have more opportunities to um

5447
03:52:39,079 --> 03:52:42,719
explore plant biology by creating

5448
03:52:41,158 --> 03:52:45,119
something unusual and seeing how it

5449
03:52:42,719 --> 03:52:49,599
works in a strange environment so that's

5450
03:52:45,120 --> 03:52:51,960
uh that's my punchline so um what so

5451
03:52:49,600 --> 03:52:54,520
just to kind of conclude we need to have

5452
03:52:51,959 --> 03:52:57,000
our genetics match the environment just

5453
03:52:54,520 --> 03:52:58,199
like the doc's pulling the dog sled you

5454
03:52:57,000 --> 03:53:00,478
have to have envir you have to have

5455
03:52:58,199 --> 03:53:02,239
genetics that match and that can we use

5456
03:53:00,478 --> 03:53:06,000
seedling traits to see what's going to

5457
03:53:02,238 --> 03:53:07,719
work in CA and I think we can and then

5458
03:53:06,000 --> 03:53:09,639
um and that the traits of interest for

5459
03:53:07,719 --> 03:53:12,599
controlled environment are very

5460
03:53:09,639 --> 03:53:14,198
different from the field potentially and

5461
03:53:12,600 --> 03:53:16,800
some of the things that we find for CA

5462
03:53:14,199 --> 03:53:19,399
make translate well to the field under

5463
03:53:16,799 --> 03:53:22,039
hot conditions or conditions like Flor

5464
03:53:19,398 --> 03:53:24,079
and can we use un unconventional

5465
03:53:22,040 --> 03:53:26,279
delivery of light to save energy and

5466
03:53:24,079 --> 03:53:28,398
this idea of pulses where we're actually

5467
03:53:26,279 --> 03:53:30,640
investing Darkness to create more

5468
03:53:28,398 --> 03:53:32,959
phenotypes through plasticity and at the

5469
03:53:30,639 --> 03:53:35,119
same time uh producing good consumer

5470
03:53:32,959 --> 03:53:36,519
products by saving money um that could

5471
03:53:35,120 --> 03:53:38,920
be potentially very nice and so

5472
03:53:36,520 --> 03:53:41,520
combining all this together may be the

5473
03:53:38,920 --> 03:53:43,238
way that we solve those problems and so

5474
03:53:41,520 --> 03:53:45,960
with that I will thank you and check out

5475
03:53:43,238 --> 03:53:48,799
talking biotech it's be 10 years since I

5476
03:53:45,959 --> 03:53:50,759
started doing this stupid thing um and

5477
03:53:48,799 --> 03:53:53,959
uh and every week for the last 10 years

5478
03:53:50,760 --> 03:53:55,800
so check that out and uh I guess that's

5479
03:53:53,959 --> 03:53:57,559
everything if you oh the other thing is

5480
03:53:55,799 --> 03:53:59,519
is that if you're a student or a postto

5481
03:53:57,559 --> 03:54:01,158
and you want to join me as a co-host

5482
03:53:59,520 --> 03:54:03,479
please reach out I'd love to have you

5483
03:54:01,158 --> 03:54:06,119
aboard it really works out nice I write

5484
03:54:03,478 --> 03:54:07,719
all the questions ahead of time and and

5485
03:54:06,120 --> 03:54:10,319
and you sound brilliant and it's a great

5486
03:54:07,719 --> 03:54:12,158
way to get another line in the CV and

5487
03:54:10,318 --> 03:54:14,879
more importantly it's another way to dip

5488
03:54:12,158 --> 03:54:17,158
your toe in science communication and

5489
03:54:14,879 --> 03:54:19,238
also show evidence that you're

5490
03:54:17,158 --> 03:54:21,199
interested in public education and

5491
03:54:19,238 --> 03:54:23,719
extension and for those of you who are

5492
03:54:21,199 --> 03:54:26,960
on the job market that one line may make

5493
03:54:23,719 --> 03:54:28,879
a very important impact as someone who

5494
03:54:26,959 --> 03:54:31,358
was a former Department shair we had

5495
03:54:28,879 --> 03:54:34,198
stacks of applicants like this and the

5496
03:54:31,359 --> 03:54:36,158
top this much were all very good and the

5497
03:54:34,199 --> 03:54:37,880
things that separated them may have been

5498
03:54:36,158 --> 03:54:40,439
a line about how they were interested in

5499
03:54:37,879 --> 03:54:42,238
public education and extension so take

5500
03:54:40,439 --> 03:54:43,559
me up on that and I'd be happy to do it

5501
03:54:42,238 --> 03:54:46,318
so why don't I stop there and I'll be

5502
03:54:43,559 --> 03:54:46,318
very happy to take

5503
03:54:46,559 --> 03:54:50,879
questions questions

5504
03:54:56,000 --> 03:55:00,600
yeah yeah so C3 C4 and cam systems how

5505
03:54:59,079 --> 03:55:02,680
they respond differently you know I have

5506
03:55:00,600 --> 03:55:04,800
no idea I haven't I I couldn't have

5507
03:55:02,680 --> 03:55:06,840
guessed how the how they were going to

5508
03:55:04,799 --> 03:55:08,478
respond so yeah I haven't gotten that

5509
03:55:06,840 --> 03:55:11,880
sophisticated yet in thinking about our

5510
03:55:08,478 --> 03:55:16,318
testing it but yeah there may may be

5511
03:55:11,879 --> 03:55:16,318
some differences that's a good point yes

5512
03:55:17,719 --> 03:55:21,599
yeah so the question is even though we

5513
03:55:19,199 --> 03:55:23,319
heard that making something simple is is

5514
03:55:21,600 --> 03:55:25,399
better and simplifying our approaches

5515
03:55:23,318 --> 03:55:26,959
makes more sense here we're looking at a

5516
03:55:25,398 --> 03:55:29,158
whole variety of different variables and

5517
03:55:26,959 --> 03:55:31,879
complexities that make this even more

5518
03:55:29,158 --> 03:55:33,520
challenging um how do you B bring the

5519
03:55:31,879 --> 03:55:38,759
two together I think that's the trick

5520
03:55:33,520 --> 03:55:40,158
though right H how do we how do we uh

5521
03:55:38,760 --> 03:55:43,559
and it is a good

5522
03:55:40,158 --> 03:55:45,879
question I think that I appreciate the

5523
03:55:43,559 --> 03:55:48,719
idea of simp it as well and I've always

5524
03:55:45,879 --> 03:55:51,839
been an under thinker of of problems and

5525
03:55:48,719 --> 03:55:54,358
that's been my key to success um and and

5526
03:55:51,840 --> 03:55:55,960
maybe that's ultimately what the

5527
03:55:54,359 --> 03:55:58,238
complicate where all of these

5528
03:55:55,959 --> 03:56:00,198
complicated ideas come from is how do we

5529
03:55:58,238 --> 03:56:02,760
just do something different you know and

5530
03:56:00,199 --> 03:56:04,439
it is a question of underthinking it I I

5531
03:56:02,760 --> 03:56:06,600
think I think it is making maybe it is

5532
03:56:04,439 --> 03:56:09,079
making it simpler that's a complicated

5533
03:56:06,600 --> 03:56:11,479
question um can I think about that and

5534
03:56:09,079 --> 03:56:13,279
get back to you I'm trying to think

5535
03:56:11,478 --> 03:56:16,238
about it on my feet and I'm and I'm

5536
03:56:13,279 --> 03:56:16,238
confusing

5537
03:56:19,318 --> 03:56:23,959
yeah yeah yeah

5538
03:56:21,478 --> 03:56:25,318
and and and but here's the point so the

5539
03:56:23,959 --> 03:56:26,398
comment was that you can make things

5540
03:56:25,318 --> 03:56:28,198
very simple with a controlled

5541
03:56:26,398 --> 03:56:30,039
environment so why you know why make it

5542
03:56:28,199 --> 03:56:32,680
complex with lots of variables and I

5543
03:56:30,040 --> 03:56:34,840
think that plants are really complex and

5544
03:56:32,680 --> 03:56:37,079
in order to maximize the output we have

5545
03:56:34,840 --> 03:56:39,840
to be sensitive to those complexities

5546
03:56:37,079 --> 03:56:42,959
and learn how to optimize our inputs to

5547
03:56:39,840 --> 03:56:45,238
get the most appropriate output so yeah

5548
03:56:42,959 --> 03:56:47,079
we can make it simple and we can say

5549
03:56:45,238 --> 03:56:48,959
we're going to put Plants under one

5550
03:56:47,079 --> 03:56:51,520
spectrum and grow them for 38 days and

5551
03:56:48,959 --> 03:56:54,839
then sell it in the market or perhaps

5552
03:56:51,520 --> 03:56:56,800
say let's interject these ideas of early

5553
03:56:54,840 --> 03:56:59,079
in development we can get greater Leaf

5554
03:56:56,799 --> 03:57:01,519
expansion with more blue light and far

5555
03:56:59,079 --> 03:57:03,158
red and by limiting the red and then as

5556
03:57:01,520 --> 03:57:04,880
this thing grows we'll put it under a

5557
03:57:03,158 --> 03:57:07,318
complete Spectrum then we're going to

5558
03:57:04,879 --> 03:57:09,398
put it in a far red enhanced Spectrum to

5559
03:57:07,318 --> 03:57:11,439
elongate the leaves and get more dollars

5560
03:57:09,398 --> 03:57:13,318
in the bag for the grower and then at

5561
03:57:11,439 --> 03:57:16,040
the end we're going to suppress the

5562
03:57:13,318 --> 03:57:18,198
flowering resp response and bolting with

5563
03:57:16,040 --> 03:57:20,359
um application of red light or whatever

5564
03:57:18,199 --> 03:57:21,800
it is that kind of dynamic system is

5565
03:57:20,359 --> 03:57:24,199
something you can only do by taking

5566
03:57:21,799 --> 03:57:28,000
apart and dissecting each each part of a

5567
03:57:24,199 --> 03:57:30,800
plant's biology and so I I I appreciate

5568
03:57:28,000 --> 03:57:33,040
the Simplicity I think it's very true

5569
03:57:30,799 --> 03:57:35,398
plants are complex and let's play with

5570
03:57:33,040 --> 03:57:38,000
that complexity and play into it I think

5571
03:57:35,398 --> 03:57:41,879
that's the better answer for me any

5572
03:57:38,000 --> 03:57:41,879
other questions yeah

5573
03:57:44,920 --> 03:57:48,920
here so the question is how do you know

5574
03:57:46,520 --> 03:57:50,439
you're making good changes and and and

5575
03:57:48,920 --> 03:57:53,000
ultimately could you have flim Zer

5576
03:57:50,439 --> 03:57:54,720
leaves or as we've shown before massive

5577
03:57:53,000 --> 03:57:57,040
accumulation of glucosinolates that are

5578
03:57:54,719 --> 03:58:00,639
so awful that you can't taste it it's so

5579
03:57:57,040 --> 03:58:02,960
bitter um yeah these are all really good

5580
03:58:00,639 --> 03:58:04,680
points but the answer is we get to do

5581
03:58:02,959 --> 03:58:06,799
the experiment and I think there's a

5582
03:58:04,680 --> 03:58:08,479
tremendous sense of job security that'll

5583
03:58:06,799 --> 03:58:12,000
take me through retirement to sort this

5584
03:58:08,478 --> 03:58:14,119
out because how do you what is there

5585
03:58:12,000 --> 03:58:16,040
inside a given genotype that we can

5586
03:58:14,120 --> 03:58:18,960
squeeze out by pushing the different

5587
03:58:16,040 --> 03:58:23,159
levers and and I think that's neat I

5588
03:58:18,959 --> 03:58:23,158
think that's neat yeah me go

5589
03:58:23,559 --> 03:58:29,600
here yeah yeah so the question is when

5590
03:58:26,879 --> 03:58:32,278
you're pulsing lights are you shortening

5591
03:58:29,600 --> 03:58:35,158
the LIF span of commercial light arrays

5592
03:58:32,279 --> 03:58:36,520
LEDs and their associate Electronics um

5593
03:58:35,158 --> 03:58:38,478
and and yeah all these things are

5594
03:58:36,520 --> 03:58:40,439
controlled with pulse wave modulators

5595
03:58:38,478 --> 03:58:42,358
and you're you know jamming current

5596
03:58:40,439 --> 03:58:44,720
through these things left and right on

5597
03:58:42,359 --> 03:58:46,439
pulses it it may shorten them

5598
03:58:44,719 --> 03:58:48,920
um but that's for engineers to figure

5599
03:58:46,439 --> 03:58:51,158
out and you I'm a guy with a soldering

5600
03:58:48,920 --> 03:58:53,158
iron and a little enough know how to be

5601
03:58:51,158 --> 03:58:57,238
dangerous and build funny things out of

5602
03:58:53,158 --> 03:58:59,879
raspberry pies so um yeah yeah it

5603
03:58:57,238 --> 03:59:02,079
probably does um it probably is really

5604
03:58:59,879 --> 03:59:04,519
hard on the electronics and it probably

5605
03:59:02,079 --> 03:59:05,959
doesn't save as much electricity as we

5606
03:59:04,520 --> 03:59:08,479
think because there's a little Spike

5607
03:59:05,959 --> 03:59:10,039
when you start those LEDs so there so

5608
03:59:08,478 --> 03:59:12,719
there are some considerations so we've

5609
03:59:10,040 --> 03:59:14,920
looked at that but um but yeah

5610
03:59:12,719 --> 03:59:16,639
ultimately I I don't think that it would

5611
03:59:14,920 --> 03:59:20,439
take away

5612
03:59:16,639 --> 03:59:23,358
from the Energy savings ultimately and

5613
03:59:20,439 --> 03:59:26,439
even if it did Energy savings are Energy

5614
03:59:23,359 --> 03:59:28,439
savings and people uh and I think that's

5615
03:59:26,439 --> 03:59:31,279
important is saving energy especially

5616
03:59:28,439 --> 03:59:33,120
you know and probably could argue it

5617
03:59:31,279 --> 03:59:35,920
takes more energy to make the damn LEDs

5618
03:59:33,120 --> 03:59:35,920
you know that may be

5619
03:59:36,520 --> 03:59:40,790
true

5620
03:59:37,709 --> 03:59:40,789
[Music]

5621
03:59:42,199 --> 03:59:47,120
oh yeah you just gave me something new

5622
03:59:44,439 --> 03:59:48,720
to think about there um no we we've been

5623
03:59:47,120 --> 03:59:50,920
doing a lot these are really easy

5624
03:59:48,719 --> 03:59:52,358
experiments for undergraduates is you

5625
03:59:50,920 --> 03:59:53,398
know take these plants and put them in

5626
03:59:52,359 --> 03:59:56,559
some condition and then we're going to

5627
03:59:53,398 --> 03:59:58,238
move them to normal and see what happens

5628
03:59:56,559 --> 03:59:59,680
and we're seeing a lot of evidence of

5629
03:59:58,238 --> 04:00:01,639
this that there there must be something

5630
03:59:59,680 --> 04:00:03,398
early that happens in development either

5631
04:00:01,639 --> 04:00:05,318
at the level of the plastid or something

5632
04:00:03,398 --> 04:00:07,680
epigenetic that happens during your

5633
04:00:05,318 --> 04:00:09,559
first days of existence that shapes the

5634
04:00:07,680 --> 04:00:12,398
way you respond to things later and I

5635
04:00:09,559 --> 04:00:14,359
think that kind of uh this also holds a

5636
04:00:12,398 --> 04:00:16,439
potential to be applicable in controlled

5637
04:00:14,359 --> 04:00:19,520
environments because if we can give you

5638
04:00:16,439 --> 04:00:21,760
this conditioning early like blue light

5639
04:00:19,520 --> 04:00:24,920
first days that you're going to flower

5640
04:00:21,760 --> 04:00:26,639
later that's pretty good I think people

5641
04:00:24,920 --> 04:00:29,478
are much happier spraying plants with

5642
04:00:26,639 --> 04:00:31,398
photons than chemistry and so I think

5643
04:00:29,478 --> 04:00:35,198
this bodes well for the potential and

5644
04:00:31,398 --> 04:00:35,198
controlled environments

5645
04:00:35,840 --> 04:00:42,238
yes yeah so we're not doing those

5646
04:00:39,158 --> 04:00:44,478
experiments yet um I'm I'm excited to

5647
04:00:42,238 --> 04:00:47,039
think about writing to get money to do

5648
04:00:44,478 --> 04:00:48,959
them but I'm short on preliminary data

5649
04:00:47,040 --> 04:00:50,840
we've got some beautiful suggestive data

5650
04:00:48,959 --> 04:00:52,599
that look like we're on to something but

5651
04:00:50,840 --> 04:00:55,439
I don't think enough to motivate a panel

5652
04:00:52,600 --> 04:00:57,840
to throw dollars at us yet so I've got a

5653
04:00:55,439 --> 04:01:01,398
team of undergraduates chipping away at

5654
04:00:57,840 --> 04:01:03,158
this as we speak so yeah no they may

5655
04:01:01,398 --> 04:01:05,478
have gone home by now never

5656
04:01:03,158 --> 04:01:07,840
mind any other

5657
04:01:05,478 --> 04:01:12,438
questions got any

5658
04:01:07,840 --> 04:01:14,920
more oh okay good got a couple more

5659
04:01:12,439 --> 04:01:16,520
yeah now so so have we done this

5660
04:01:14,920 --> 04:01:18,439
experiment on strawberry or other crop

5661
04:01:16,520 --> 04:01:20,000
genetics haven't uh really yet we've

5662
04:01:18,439 --> 04:01:22,439
stuck with kind of these leafy green

5663
04:01:20,000 --> 04:01:23,639
sprouty things because they're leafy

5664
04:01:22,439 --> 04:01:25,359
greens and Sprouts because they're

5665
04:01:23,639 --> 04:01:27,639
directly germine to the industry in

5666
04:01:25,359 --> 04:01:30,880
controlled environments strawberries are

5667
04:01:27,639 --> 04:01:32,920
two but that's a fruit and that's a

5668
04:01:30,879 --> 04:01:35,158
whole another thing um I've kind of

5669
04:01:32,920 --> 04:01:39,000
drifted out of strawberries we it was a

5670
04:01:35,158 --> 04:01:41,398
big deal for a long time but um there's

5671
04:01:39,000 --> 04:01:43,199
there's not as much industry interest in

5672
04:01:41,398 --> 04:01:46,358
uh they're more interested in uh ways of

5673
04:01:43,199 --> 04:01:48,279
dealing with tactical problems and uh

5674
04:01:46,359 --> 04:01:50,640
competition from Mexico you know and

5675
04:01:48,279 --> 04:01:53,158
things like that are much bigger issues

5676
04:01:50,639 --> 04:01:56,439
than can we put a funny light on it you

5677
04:01:53,158 --> 04:01:58,760
know so yeah unfortunately yeah there's

5678
04:01:56,439 --> 04:02:01,439
another question

5679
04:01:58,760 --> 04:02:04,120
yes

5680
04:02:01,439 --> 04:02:06,720
ah you're you're you you've you've read

5681
04:02:04,120 --> 04:02:10,680
my proposal for the Swiss Army

5682
04:02:06,719 --> 04:02:12,599
plant yeah yeah we would uh this was an

5683
04:02:10,680 --> 04:02:14,680
idea for NASA you know you you can't

5684
04:02:12,600 --> 04:02:16,158
take it with you um can't take a lot of

5685
04:02:14,680 --> 04:02:18,199
things with you so can you take

5686
04:02:16,158 --> 04:02:20,398
something that can agile produce a lot

5687
04:02:18,199 --> 04:02:21,880
of useful secondary metabolites and put

5688
04:02:20,398 --> 04:02:24,039
them under different controllable

5689
04:02:21,879 --> 04:02:26,478
promoters to take one plant that can

5690
04:02:24,040 --> 04:02:27,920
give you different secondary metabolites

5691
04:02:26,478 --> 04:02:30,039
that could be used either in as

5692
04:02:27,920 --> 04:02:32,478
antibiotics chemotherapeutic agents

5693
04:02:30,040 --> 04:02:34,199
potentially or whatever you could could

5694
04:02:32,478 --> 04:02:36,599
you do that I think there's something

5695
04:02:34,199 --> 04:02:38,040
there I think that's a really neat idea

5696
04:02:36,600 --> 04:02:40,120
for those of you who are big fans of

5697
04:02:38,040 --> 04:02:42,199
barasa domestication you know you can

5698
04:02:40,120 --> 04:02:43,560
take one set of genetics and tug it in a

5699
04:02:42,199 --> 04:02:45,399
couple different directions with a few

5700
04:02:43,559 --> 04:02:47,680
tweets weeks to give very different

5701
04:02:45,398 --> 04:02:50,719
outputs and I think we could use

5702
04:02:47,680 --> 04:02:53,520
controllable promoters and their um and

5703
04:02:50,719 --> 04:02:56,398
their uh and and the signals that ignite

5704
04:02:53,520 --> 04:02:57,760
them to give us different outputs yeah

5705
04:02:56,398 --> 04:02:59,639
it's a pretty neat

5706
04:02:57,760 --> 04:03:02,439
idea anything

5707
04:02:59,639 --> 04:03:05,198

do

5750
04:04:54,559 --> 04:04:59,639
so um when we kind of planned this

5751
04:04:56,799 --> 04:05:03,438
committee we wanted a wide range

5752
04:04:59,639 --> 04:05:06,599
of topics and so we picked a very broad

5753
04:05:03,439 --> 04:05:09,120
um theme and I think you know we heard

5754
04:05:06,600 --> 04:05:11,600
from about mushrooms algae

5755
04:05:09,120 --> 04:05:13,439
lettuce cover crops really everything

5756
04:05:11,600 --> 04:05:15,238
you can think of in plant breeding and

5757
04:05:13,439 --> 04:05:17,158
well and really not plant breeding but

5758
04:05:15,238 --> 04:05:19,198
in just breeding in general and so I

5759
04:05:17,158 --> 04:05:21,119
hope you guys can come away with you

5760
04:05:19,199 --> 04:05:23,800
know some novel ideas and thoughts for

5761
04:05:21,120 --> 04:05:25,359
your own research and maybe for us grad

5762
04:05:23,799 --> 04:05:27,478
students maybe we don't have to stick

5763
04:05:25,359 --> 04:05:29,960
with our crops and we can Venture forth

5764
04:05:27,478 --> 04:05:31,198
