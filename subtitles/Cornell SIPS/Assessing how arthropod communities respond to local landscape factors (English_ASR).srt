1
00:00:00,359 --> 00:00:04,000
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:06,559 --> 00:00:10,759
University so as my title shows I'm

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,040
going to use this opportunity to sort of

4
00:00:10,759 --> 00:00:13,320
look back over the last few years of

5
00:00:12,039 --> 00:00:15,199
different research projects I've been

6
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:17,879
involved in in which we particularly

7
00:00:15,199 --> 00:00:19,839
looked at how arod communities respond

8
00:00:17,879 --> 00:00:22,239
to different act management practices

9
00:00:19,839 --> 00:00:24,960
environmental factors and so the common

10
00:00:22,239 --> 00:00:27,439
theme will be Community level response

11
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,400
uh where the factors differ will be the

12
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:32,118
focal arthropod tax that we're looking

13
00:00:29,399 --> 00:00:34,199
at the crop man the cropping system and

14
00:00:32,118 --> 00:00:35,320
then the landscape context of the area

15
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,559
so I'm going to try to cover three

16
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:39,320
different topics here and so I might

17
00:00:37,558 --> 00:00:42,199
move quickly feel free to interject if

18
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:44,399
you have any

19
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:46,359
questions so just about myself real

20
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:47,920
quick as Don said in the introduction

21
00:00:46,359 --> 00:00:50,238
the main goal if I could reduce it down

22
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:52,600
to one idea is that my work tries to

23
00:00:50,238 --> 00:00:54,198
identify management practices or other

24
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:55,800
environmental factors that maximize the

25
00:00:54,198 --> 00:00:58,000
abundance and diversity of beneficial

26
00:00:55,799 --> 00:01:00,399
arthopods in Agro ecosystems and if

27
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,119
possible concurrently measure ecosystem

28
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:03,120
Services as

29
00:01:03,518 --> 00:01:08,560
well so before I get into the three

30
00:01:05,879 --> 00:01:09,879
topics we're going to look at I just uh

31
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,159
want to point out again everything I'll

32
00:01:09,879 --> 00:01:13,118
talk about today is at the community

33
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:15,280
level or at least multiple species

34
00:01:13,118 --> 00:01:16,680
systems and so when I think of these you

35
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,960
sort of have different analytical

36
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:20,360
toolboxes you can pull from to assess

37
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:23,639
communities that differ than say working

38
00:01:20,359 --> 00:01:26,280
at the population level and so one

39
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:27,960
objective maybe to look at diversity and

40
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:29,960
so some of the things I'll present today

41
00:01:27,959 --> 00:01:32,118
might relate to species richness where

42
00:01:29,959 --> 00:01:34,039
will present rare faction curves which

43
00:01:32,118 --> 00:01:36,799
is sort of a standardized way to compare

44
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:39,600
species accumulation as it rises with

45
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:41,799
sampling intensity among locations or

46
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:43,679
habitats uh we may look at evenness the

47
00:01:41,799 --> 00:01:46,320
relative abundance of different species

48
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:48,118
within a system or we may combine these

49
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:49,839
two things with richness and evenness

50
00:01:48,118 --> 00:01:52,200
into a single diversity indic which

51
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:54,478
you've probably all heard of or we may

52
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:56,399
use similarity indices if I'm interested

53
00:01:54,478 --> 00:01:58,640
in comparing the amount of overlap of

54
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:00,840
species among different habitats or

55
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,759
treatments the other sort of toolbox

56
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:04,439
I'll pull from is this idea of community

57
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:05,840
structure because when you work with

58
00:02:04,438 --> 00:02:07,639
diversity measures you sort of lose that

59
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,399
species level resolution you're reducing

60
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:10,719
everything to a number per se and you

61
00:02:09,399 --> 00:02:13,239
don't know how different species are

62
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:14,639
responding in different ways and so here

63
00:02:13,239 --> 00:02:16,280
I'm going to present results from

64
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:18,439
different ordination techniques where we

65
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:20,360
can look at how species and treatments

66
00:02:18,439 --> 00:02:22,318
associate with one another by

67
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:24,440
identifying sort of dominant gradients

68
00:02:22,318 --> 00:02:25,878
in the community and then looking at

69
00:02:24,439 --> 00:02:27,519
groups of species and how they're

70
00:02:25,878 --> 00:02:29,598
responding and So within that I'm

71
00:02:27,519 --> 00:02:32,239
looking Prim using primarily redundancy

72
00:02:29,598 --> 00:02:34,359
anal is which is a form of constrained

73
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:36,319
ordination where we're looking at actual

74
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:38,959
how the environmental factors in our

75
00:02:36,318 --> 00:02:40,919
experimental design relate to these

76
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:42,479
subsets of the community and then

77
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:44,199
another one I'll introduce is this idea

78
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:45,639
of principal response curve which is

79
00:02:44,199 --> 00:02:47,158
similar but it has an added layer of

80
00:02:45,639 --> 00:02:49,279
complexity and that you also have a Time

81
00:02:47,158 --> 00:02:50,199
component so the principal response

82
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:53,080
curve would be something like a

83
00:02:50,199 --> 00:02:54,598
multivariant repeated measures so how

84
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:58,080
these species respond to treatment

85
00:02:54,598 --> 00:03:00,359
factors at multiple points in

86
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:02,159
time so I'm a little Ambi ious I'm going

87
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:04,040
to try to get through all three of these

88
00:03:02,158 --> 00:03:05,639
but uh I just feel it's interesting to

89
00:03:04,039 --> 00:03:07,280
sort of take a broad look at three

90
00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:09,199
different studies so the first one I'm

91
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:11,680
going to talk about are ground beetles

92
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:14,000
which are in the family carabid uh in a

93
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,480
maze cropping system and the landscape

94
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,840
context would be then these Ridge and

95
00:03:15,479 --> 00:03:19,959
Valley physiographic profits in Central

96
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:22,400
PA uh the second one we look at a

97
00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:24,039
broader beneficial group of taxa we have

98
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,920
the pollinators predators and

99
00:03:24,039 --> 00:03:27,919
parasitoids and how they're responding

100
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:30,518
to practices in Mid-Atlantic tree fruit

101
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:32,479
specifically south central Pennsylvania

102
00:03:30,519 --> 00:03:34,599
and then the third one is a much

103
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:36,199
different system I'm looking at how wild

104
00:03:34,598 --> 00:03:37,759
bees respond to different conditions in

105
00:03:36,199 --> 00:03:41,359
Community Gardens throughout New York

106
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:41,359
city so an urban landscape

107
00:03:41,799 --> 00:03:47,000
context so let's begin with the ground

108
00:03:45,158 --> 00:03:48,479
beetles so for each one I'm going to

109
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,400
sort of talk about those three factors

110
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:53,199
so as far as the landscape uh you have

111
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:55,200
this rigon Valley region here where you

112
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:57,518
sort of have these long parallel

113
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:59,959
forested slopes and in The Valleys there

114
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:01,480
are these AG dominated valleys and so

115
00:03:59,959 --> 00:04:02,519
depending on where your farm may be you

116
00:04:01,479 --> 00:04:04,639
could be in the center part of the

117
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:06,319
valley in an agricultural Matrix or it's

118
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:08,479
not uncommon to be on the edge of the

119
00:04:06,318 --> 00:04:10,119
valley bordering directly adjacent to

120
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:13,399
forested areas so that comes into play

121
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:16,079
in part of our research as

122
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:17,879
well and the focal taxa for this group

123
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,358
will be members of the family carabid

124
00:04:17,879 --> 00:04:20,560
which are a very diverse group of

125
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:22,560
beetles if you haven't heard of them

126
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:25,199
before there's about 40,000 species

127
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,120
worldwide maybe 2,000 in North America

128
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:27,879
and they're very popular with

129
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:29,478
entomologists because they seem to be

130
00:04:27,879 --> 00:04:31,759
good bioindicators and so we can use

131
00:04:29,478 --> 00:04:33,918
them to test the effects of different

132
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:35,199
management practices and what have you

133
00:04:33,918 --> 00:04:37,680
they also provide us with many great

134
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,680
ecosystem services so many people go

135
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,000
throughout their whole lives never

136
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:41,759
looking at these small little beetles

137
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,600
near their feet yet they're providing us

138
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:45,879
with wonderful services such as pest

139
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,960
predation uh they're becoming more

140
00:04:45,879 --> 00:04:49,918
widely known for their predation of weed

141
00:04:47,959 --> 00:04:52,159
seeds and some estimates are that for

142
00:04:49,918 --> 00:04:53,799
all the seed removal from a system 40%

143
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,199
can be attributed to just these these

144
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,199
beetles

145
00:04:56,478 --> 00:05:01,319
alone and then the cropping system or

146
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:02,919
the Contex of the study uh is going to

147
00:05:01,319 --> 00:05:05,038
deal with this introduction of trans

148
00:05:02,918 --> 00:05:07,038
genes into agar ecosystems in this

149
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:09,319
region and so we've done several studies

150
00:05:07,038 --> 00:05:12,199
here I'm going to focus on one that's

151
00:05:09,319 --> 00:05:14,120
looking at uh transgenic maze that is

152
00:05:12,199 --> 00:05:17,879
corn root worm protected which is a

153
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:20,199
beetle Pest and this BT maze expresses a

154
00:05:17,879 --> 00:05:22,560
cry3 toxin that's supposed to be

155
00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:25,038
directly targeting this Beetle Pest and

156
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,600
so our basic question coming into it was

157
00:05:25,038 --> 00:05:28,240
introducing this new Pest Management

158
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:31,199
technique could it potentially affect

159
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:34,038
non-target beetle that are beneficial

160
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:36,400
and live in the same area uh a lot of

161
00:05:34,038 --> 00:05:38,079
studies work on these non-target effects

162
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:40,239
and often they try to isolate the effect

163
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:41,918
of the trans Gene and its product we use

164
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,600
a slightly different approach what I

165
00:05:41,918 --> 00:05:47,120
like to refer to as a systems approach a

166
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:50,600
real world approach uh for example this

167
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:52,879
Cry 3 BT maze comes coupled with other

168
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:55,160
seed management Technologies including

169
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:58,038
neonicotinoid SE treatments which could

170
00:05:55,160 --> 00:06:00,199
potentially also negatively affect these

171
00:05:58,038 --> 00:06:01,759
communities so we designed a set of

172
00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:05,160
tiered studies assessing the effects of

173
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:07,919
BT maze our field work was preceded by

174
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:09,599
laboratory toxicology work uh where we

175
00:06:07,918 --> 00:06:11,879
tested the effect of the cry proteins

176
00:06:09,598 --> 00:06:14,439
for example and long story short they

177
00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:16,759
seem to have no effect on the Beetles we

178
00:06:14,439 --> 00:06:20,598
fed many different species of crabbed

179
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:22,520
beetles large amounts of BT corn pollen

180
00:06:20,598 --> 00:06:25,639
for hundreds of days in a Petri dish in

181
00:06:22,519 --> 00:06:27,359
a drawer and they survived just fine

182
00:06:25,639 --> 00:06:30,800
different story with a seed treatment so

183
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:32,879
one presented with seed things with the

184
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:35,319
neonicotinoid SE treatment we had nearly

185
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:38,038
100% mortality of these beetles in the

186
00:06:35,319 --> 00:06:39,919
lab setting however there did seem to be

187
00:06:38,038 --> 00:06:41,399
a slight anti-feedant effect so we

188
00:06:39,918 --> 00:06:44,079
wondered would we pick up these effects

189
00:06:41,399 --> 00:06:46,198
in the field or not so then we moved to

190
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:47,758
sort of an ecotoxicological approach so

191
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:50,160
how are populations communities

192
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:52,199
responding in a field

193
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,599
setting and so here's an example of one

194
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:55,759
of the studies we worked on that we

195
00:06:53,598 --> 00:06:58,120
called the ecotoxicology of transgenic

196
00:06:55,759 --> 00:07:00,680
Maze and we would have these randomized

197
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:02,720
complete block designs in which we would

198
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:04,319
pitfall trap for beetles it's the most

199
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,520
commonly used trapping technique for

200
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:09,439
these epigeal or soil surface dwelling

201
00:07:06,519 --> 00:07:11,758
arthopods it's basically a sunken Cup on

202
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:14,199
the ground anything that crawls calls

203
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:17,319
along Falls in and we collect

204
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:19,960
it uh the treatment factorial we used

205
00:07:17,319 --> 00:07:21,598
was based on genetics and then on

206
00:07:19,959 --> 00:07:23,359
conventional management practices so the

207
00:07:21,598 --> 00:07:25,279
first part of the factorial would be

208
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:28,520
whether it was the BT corn or its

209
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:30,799
nearest genetic isoline keep in mind

210
00:07:28,519 --> 00:07:32,680
though the BT is inherently coupled with

211
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,280
the neonicotinoid SE treatment so it's a

212
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:36,319
coupled technology we're not trying to

213
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:37,478
differentiate among them however any

214
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:39,160
effects we see in the field we were

215
00:07:37,478 --> 00:07:41,000
tributing then to the neonicotinoid

216
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:43,080
based on the laboratory toxicological

217
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,800
work the second part of the factorial

218
00:07:43,079 --> 00:07:47,959
then is whether there is a soil incde

219
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:49,280
applied at planting a pyoid that's a

220
00:07:47,959 --> 00:07:52,318
conventional management for corn

221
00:07:49,279 --> 00:07:54,719
rootworm and non-rotated field corn

222
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:57,240
versus n so we get these four different

223
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:59,120
designs for example isce line un manage

224
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:02,199
would be our control There's No Pest

225
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:04,158
manage practice at all there isoline

226
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:06,240
manage would be sort of a conventional

227
00:08:04,158 --> 00:08:08,879
management with that soil

228
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:10,800
insecticide BT unmanaged would simulate

229
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:12,479
a grower who decide to adopt the BT

230
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,759
technology with a neonicotinoid to

231
00:08:12,478 --> 00:08:18,719
control corn rootworm and then this one

232
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:22,038
I call the double Amy the BT with uh the

233
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:25,560
neony treatment and the pyoid soil

234
00:08:22,038 --> 00:08:25,560
application just to round out the

235
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:29,560
factorial and so I like to put these

236
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:31,079
slides in I don't want you to be able to

237
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:32,719
read that but this is just to impress on

238
00:08:31,079 --> 00:08:35,158
you when you decide to do community

239
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:37,320
level work the amount of tax taxonomic

240
00:08:35,158 --> 00:08:40,080
investment and sampling effort that goes

241
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:42,560
in we collected over 7,000 beetles every

242
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:44,720
single one pinned and identified as

243
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:46,559
species uh with the help of Robert

244
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,440
Davidson from the carnegi Museum of

245
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:50,039
Natural History in Pittsburgh and you

246
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:51,920
can see here we found quite a diverse

247
00:08:50,039 --> 00:08:54,159
range of Beatles too in a cropping

248
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:56,479
monoculture 50 different species of just

249
00:08:54,159 --> 00:09:00,240
one family of Beatles right there's a

250
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:00,240
lot going on out there

251
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:04,440
and so since The Pest Management inputs

252
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:06,600
occurred at the beginning part of the

253
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:09,560
field season at planting uh we were

254
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:11,839
interested in how these communities

255
00:09:09,559 --> 00:09:13,359
responded to treatments over time as

256
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:15,399
well so here's a case where we decided

257
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:17,360
to use this principal response curve

258
00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:19,000
ordination technique and basically what

259
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:21,120
you're plotting are what we call the

260
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,039
temporal trajectories of community

261
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,399
composition and in order to do a

262
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:26,838
principal response curve it has to be in

263
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:27,958
relation to a control and so I have this

264
00:09:26,839 --> 00:09:29,079
little in case you haven't seen a

265
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:31,319
principal response curve before I have

266
00:09:29,078 --> 00:09:33,759
this little training slide as what it

267
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:35,399
looks like so the output the visual

268
00:09:33,759 --> 00:09:38,399
output would be a control shown as a

269
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:41,720
horizontal line with time going left to

270
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:43,240
right and then the temporal trajectories

271
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:44,560
would be the communities in your

272
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:45,919
different treatments so the

273
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:48,759
interpretation for this would be that

274
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:50,599
treatment a as a community in that

275
00:09:48,759 --> 00:09:53,360
treatment overall responds in a negative

276
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:54,839
Fashion on average to the control

277
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,320
treatment B the community is responding

278
00:09:54,839 --> 00:09:58,519
in a in a positive fashion meaning

279
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,839
you're finding the individual species at

280
00:09:58,519 --> 00:10:02,560
higher abundances

281
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:05,720
keep in mind that these lines are entire

282
00:10:02,559 --> 00:10:08,399
communities those aren't populations and

283
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:10,200
so in order to look at species specific

284
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:12,399
data the principal response curve comes

285
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:15,560
coupled with what are called species

286
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:18,360
weights and so if you have species with

287
00:10:15,559 --> 00:10:21,319
a positive species weight they tend to

288
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:23,159
follow the principal response if they

289
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:25,240
have a negative species weight they act

290
00:10:23,159 --> 00:10:26,719
in the opposite fashion because

291
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:29,000
inherently when you study communities

292
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,680
there's a lot of fuzziness and you get

293
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,879
different ential reactions to the

294
00:10:30,679 --> 00:10:33,759
different conditions right so you have

295
00:10:31,879 --> 00:10:36,159
different species responding differently

296
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:37,439
the line represents the overall trend at

297
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:39,639
the community

298
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:42,920
level and so now what did we find from

299
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:44,560
our eoto study it was two years that's

300
00:10:42,919 --> 00:10:47,240
why you sort of see the two groups from

301
00:10:44,559 --> 00:10:49,119
left to right again the horizontal line

302
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:52,320
where you see those darkened circles

303
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:53,879
that's our control the iso unmanaged and

304
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:56,000
then the other three you can see pretty

305
00:10:53,879 --> 00:10:57,838
closely follow one another and that you

306
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,360
see where those large dark arrows are

307
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:02,560
those are our Pest Management inputs you

308
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:04,120
see a decline in all three communities

309
00:11:02,559 --> 00:11:05,759
for the three treatments over time

310
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:07,799
followed by a rebound later in the

311
00:11:05,759 --> 00:11:10,240
season that may be due to immigrants

312
00:11:07,799 --> 00:11:13,879
coming in or later emerging species or

313
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:16,320
what have you and so we're concluding

314
00:11:13,879 --> 00:11:18,639
from this it seems to be that even with

315
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:21,000
the transgenic technology that neon

316
00:11:18,639 --> 00:11:23,480
neonicotinoid C treatment also has a

317
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,519
deleterious effect on the community and

318
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:27,480
so you get this same response no matter

319
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:32,278
which treatment we were looking

320
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:34,440
at um keep in mind that not all of these

321
00:11:32,278 --> 00:11:35,879
uh transgenic crops come coupled though

322
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:38,480
with these seed treatments so we did do

323
00:11:35,879 --> 00:11:40,480
another study that I'll just say what we

324
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:42,600
did and it was a more of a diversified

325
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:45,879
Farm setting where we had sweet corn

326
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:48,759
potato squash and we compared transgenic

327
00:11:45,879 --> 00:11:51,200
systems versus conventional no control

328
00:11:48,759 --> 00:11:53,600
plot but just using grower standards we

329
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:56,000
managed the two and we documented

330
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,959
pesticide inputs and looked at Community

331
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,159
level response and in that case like

332
00:11:57,958 --> 00:12:01,719
this Diversified Farm setting

333
00:12:00,159 --> 00:12:03,480
what we found is

334
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:05,639
that the

335
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:07,399
isoline the non-transgenic clots

336
00:12:05,639 --> 00:12:09,959
actually required more insecticide

337
00:12:07,399 --> 00:12:12,159
inputs due to lack of control of the

338
00:12:09,958 --> 00:12:14,198
focal pest taxa that the trans Gene

339
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:16,360
controlled for in the transgenic plot so

340
00:12:14,198 --> 00:12:18,319
in that case these little blue squares

341
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:20,759
you see here these are species

342
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:22,000
accumulation curves and so as you

343
00:12:20,759 --> 00:12:24,039
increase the number of individuals

344
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,039
you've collected you increase the number

345
00:12:24,039 --> 00:12:27,519
of species in almost all instances we

346
00:12:26,039 --> 00:12:30,240
had slightly higher species richness

347
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:31,600
actually in the transgenic systems due

348
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,560
to what we believe were fewer

349
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:35,079
insecticide inputs just due to effective

350
00:12:33,559 --> 00:12:36,679
control because these did not contain

351
00:12:35,078 --> 00:12:40,319
that that seed treatment that could be

352
00:12:36,679 --> 00:12:40,319
affecting these epigeal

353
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:45,320
pootra so in general though we found

354
00:12:43,958 --> 00:12:47,239
that we really just weren't finding any

355
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:51,278
differences between transgenic systems

356
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:52,959
versus conventional and so uh we wanted

357
00:12:51,278 --> 00:12:54,000
to do an additional study to consider

358
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:55,679
well what about position in the

359
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,559
landscape does that affect the ground

360
00:12:55,679 --> 00:13:01,000
beetle community so again we're in this

361
00:12:57,559 --> 00:13:02,479
rig Valley region all of our work so far

362
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,879
had been done and sort of surrounded by

363
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:06,560
an agricultural Matrix yet there were

364
00:13:04,879 --> 00:13:09,360
all these Farms that were directly

365
00:13:06,559 --> 00:13:11,799
adjacent to the forested area so we

366
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:14,519
performed one more study uh where we

367
00:13:11,799 --> 00:13:16,519
looked at the effect of these field

368
00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:19,320
margins where you're growing maze next

369
00:13:16,519 --> 00:13:21,600
to this continuous forested habitat and

370
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:23,720
we did more Pitfall trapping and so we

371
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:25,800
set up this transect design at multiple

372
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:28,079
locations throughout the valley where

373
00:13:25,799 --> 00:13:30,359
you had traps extending from interior

374
00:13:28,078 --> 00:13:32,559
forest from left to right going through

375
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:34,720
a grassy margin typical for Farm

376
00:13:32,559 --> 00:13:36,759
vehicles and then the whole way into the

377
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:39,440
interior part of the maze field and so

378
00:13:36,759 --> 00:13:41,399
this experimental design allowed us to

379
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,720
approach approach the data from two

380
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:45,480
different ways we could sort of group

381
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:47,959
the traps and just compare between

382
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:49,480
discrete habitats Forest versus grass

383
00:13:47,958 --> 00:13:51,638
versus maze what type of beetles are we

384
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:53,120
finding or we could use the transect

385
00:13:51,639 --> 00:13:55,680
design to look at how the community

386
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:56,959
shifts from one location on the transit

387
00:13:55,679 --> 00:13:58,638
to the next and we were trying to

388
00:13:56,958 --> 00:14:01,359
categorize how are these Beatles

389
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:04,278
responding to these ecotones in these

390
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,278
agricultural

391
00:14:04,679 --> 00:14:09,198
Landscapes and so first at the discreet

392
00:14:07,278 --> 00:14:11,399
habitat level we just looked at

393
00:14:09,198 --> 00:14:13,519
biodiversity how it differs and these

394
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:15,078
turned out really nice I even thought

395
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:16,278
about submitting this to like an ecology

396
00:14:15,078 --> 00:14:18,758
textbook or something because it really

397
00:14:16,278 --> 00:14:21,120
shows why you should use rare faction to

398
00:14:18,759 --> 00:14:23,320
compare species richness uh because

399
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:24,879
there was a sampling bias we had Pitfall

400
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,879
traps in the corn and the grass and the

401
00:14:24,879 --> 00:14:28,480
forest but if you think of the

402
00:14:25,879 --> 00:14:30,919
vegetation the forest very dense the

403
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:33,120
activity Den The Beetles is much lower

404
00:14:30,919 --> 00:14:34,958
and so just on average we caught many

405
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,759
more beetles in the corn just because

406
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:38,599
it's a much more open environment which

407
00:14:36,759 --> 00:14:40,639
can bias than the number of total

408
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:42,800
species we think are there so if you

409
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:44,399
would just look at the end points as far

410
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:46,639
as species richness they're all very

411
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:48,480
similar however rare faction allows you

412
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:50,240
to go back to a standardized number of

413
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:53,278
individuals collected let's say around

414
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:55,240
300 and we found significant differences

415
00:14:53,278 --> 00:14:56,838
between the forest and the corn

416
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:58,879
Community as far as species richness so

417
00:14:56,839 --> 00:15:00,959
the forest was much more diverse than

418
00:14:58,879 --> 00:15:02,720
the the Corn based on species

419
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:05,278
accumulation

420
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:07,120
rates likewise with dominance

421
00:15:05,278 --> 00:15:09,039
distribution or evenness you can see the

422
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:11,360
forest on the bottom here the most

423
00:15:09,039 --> 00:15:13,679
abundant species just represented maybe

424
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:15,879
12% of the total number of beetles

425
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:17,399
collected whereas the corn and the grass

426
00:15:15,879 --> 00:15:19,679
you get these highly skewed dominant

427
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:22,120
structures our Palace

428
00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:24,439
pennsylvanicus a good species a weed

429
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:26,360
seed Predator however you can see nearly

430
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:27,959
60% of all the Beetles caught were one

431
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:30,120
species so you get these really skewed

432
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:32,479
down in the structure uh same with the

433
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:34,078
grass here so overall we're concluding

434
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:36,680
that the forest represents a much more

435
00:15:34,078 --> 00:15:39,559
diverse and stable community embedded in

436
00:15:36,679 --> 00:15:39,559
these agricultural

437
00:15:40,078 --> 00:15:44,758
Landscapes so now what about using the

438
00:15:43,198 --> 00:15:46,879
transect to look do a spatial type

439
00:15:44,759 --> 00:15:49,519
analysis from one trap location to the

440
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:51,639
next so we decided we really like that

441
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:53,360
principal response curve but if you

442
00:15:51,639 --> 00:15:55,600
remember that that's supposed to be used

443
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:57,039
for temporal trajectories we thought can

444
00:15:55,600 --> 00:16:00,399
we sort of trick the program and just do

445
00:15:57,039 --> 00:16:02,559
it in a spatial context so each of these

446
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:05,120
dots from left to right represents a

447
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:07,039
position on the transit and so we said

448
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:09,440
our interior Forest one is sort of the

449
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:11,120
Baseline community of cbids what would

450
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:13,519
be there if we didn't impose

451
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:15,360
agricultural fields on the landscape and

452
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:17,919
so we considered that our control and we

453
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:20,000
really took the species by sample Matrix

454
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:23,078
from that location and just replicated

455
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:25,559
it multiple times in our data set and

456
00:16:23,078 --> 00:16:27,638
then we compared the cabic communities

457
00:16:25,559 --> 00:16:30,399
found at each location of the transect

458
00:16:27,639 --> 00:16:32,480
back to the interior Forest one so each

459
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:34,839
of these represents the relative

460
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:36,920
dissimilarity with the interior Forest

461
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:38,279
community and so we get we put it in a

462
00:16:36,919 --> 00:16:40,240
principal response curve we get this

463
00:16:38,278 --> 00:16:42,679
nice you see as you approach the Forest

464
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:44,278
Grass ecotone the crabbit community is

465
00:16:42,679 --> 00:16:45,919
inevitably being influenced by the

466
00:16:44,278 --> 00:16:47,639
neighboring habitat and it starts to

467
00:16:45,919 --> 00:16:49,559
become more dissimilar to the interior

468
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:51,839
Forest Community then as soon as you

469
00:16:49,559 --> 00:16:54,399
cross into a new habitat you get this

470
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:57,240
drastic Decline and again here as you

471
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:58,639
approach this next ecotone so we found

472
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:02,560
obviously a significant difference in

473
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:05,160
the cabbit Community between forest and

474
00:17:02,559 --> 00:17:06,678
corn and so that was one of our

475
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:08,720
objectives going in do the cabbits

476
00:17:06,679 --> 00:17:11,280
perceive this eone as a hard Edge or is

477
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:13,279
it highly permeable and so from this we

478
00:17:11,279 --> 00:17:15,240
would conclude that it was a a hard Edge

479
00:17:13,279 --> 00:17:17,000
right you get this very quick rapid

480
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:19,160
turnover in community

481
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,838
composition remember the species weights

482
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:22,558
the positives follow the principal

483
00:17:20,838 --> 00:17:25,318
response so these we could identify then

484
00:17:22,558 --> 00:17:27,798
as Forest Specialists because they

485
00:17:25,318 --> 00:17:29,159
follow they become less abundant As you

486
00:17:27,798 --> 00:17:31,599
move from left to right AC Ross the

487
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:32,880
transect these we would identify as corn

488
00:17:31,599 --> 00:17:35,879
Specialists because they would actually

489
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:37,400
increase abundance as you come into this

490
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:40,720
area here into the

491
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:43,080
corn however that's not the whole story

492
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:44,919
because when we plotted population

493
00:17:43,079 --> 00:17:47,240
distributions despite that quick

494
00:17:44,919 --> 00:17:50,080
turnover we were able to identify

495
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:52,440
several species that seem to be ecotone

496
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:53,839
Specialists and just anecdotally we

497
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:55,600
noted from collecting in other maze

498
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:57,158
fields in the agricultural Matrix that

499
00:17:55,599 --> 00:17:59,199
we seem to be getting some different

500
00:17:57,159 --> 00:18:02,840
beetles at this Forest adjacent recent

501
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:04,240
location in particular terus digus

502
00:18:02,839 --> 00:18:07,759
psychot trus

503
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:09,038
feris pus Luca blandis all of these were

504
00:18:07,759 --> 00:18:12,519
at much higher abundances or weren't

505
00:18:09,038 --> 00:18:13,440
even present at the AG Matrix location

506
00:18:12,519 --> 00:18:15,038
and so when we plotted their

507
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:18,240
distribution they seem to be going

508
00:18:15,038 --> 00:18:21,558
readily from forest to cornfield and so

509
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:23,440
our last question was can we document

510
00:18:21,558 --> 00:18:25,839
that there's a significant difference in

511
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:27,320
the communities in maze adjacent to

512
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:29,918
Forest than those embedded in

513
00:18:27,319 --> 00:18:31,720
agricultural Matrix

514
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:33,679
and so we sort of pulled data from all

515
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:35,720
kinds of different studies all over for

516
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:37,840
example the blue circles might represent

517
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:40,279
locations that are in the agricultural

518
00:18:37,839 --> 00:18:42,519
Matrix yellow are locations we sampled

519
00:18:40,279 --> 00:18:45,879
from forest adjacent and we basically

520
00:18:42,519 --> 00:18:47,918
did pairwise similarity calculations

521
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:49,320
which are rooted in the number of shared

522
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:52,120
species versus the number of unique

523
00:18:49,319 --> 00:18:55,399
species in each and so when we looked

524
00:18:52,119 --> 00:18:58,798
for similarity between a matrix and

525
00:18:55,400 --> 00:19:01,559
Forest adjacent locations we found that

526
00:18:58,798 --> 00:19:04,158
similarity was 17 to 53% lower than

527
00:19:01,558 --> 00:19:05,678
similarity between just different mag

528
00:19:04,159 --> 00:19:07,200
Matrix locations so what we were

529
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:09,919
concluding is

530
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:11,440
that the kabic community in these Forest

531
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:12,960
adjacent locations were distinctly

532
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:15,120
different than those within the

533
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:18,519
agricultural

534
00:19:15,119 --> 00:19:20,158
Matrix so for the first study what are

535
00:19:18,519 --> 00:19:21,400
some key findings at the local level we

536
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:23,760
were again looking at the introduction

537
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:25,798
of these transgenic systems we found

538
00:19:23,759 --> 00:19:27,519
that both conventional and seed-based

539
00:19:25,798 --> 00:19:29,960
Pest Management tactics seem to

540
00:19:27,519 --> 00:19:31,759
similarly influence cabbits on these

541
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:34,400
Northeastern small farms and we

542
00:19:31,759 --> 00:19:35,640
attributed that to the the effect of

543
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,720
that seed treatment which may have

544
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:40,038
deleterious effects on these ground

545
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:41,600
dwelling beetles and we could detect

546
00:19:40,038 --> 00:19:44,119
this in the field setting just as we

547
00:19:41,599 --> 00:19:45,839
detected it in the lab setting as well

548
00:19:44,119 --> 00:19:49,759
neonix obviously being more in the news

549
00:19:45,839 --> 00:19:52,199
now with potential effects to bees as

550
00:19:49,759 --> 00:19:53,720
well at the landscape level we found

551
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:55,919
that crabon communities and forested

552
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:57,440
areas are more diverse exhibit high

553
00:19:55,919 --> 00:20:00,120
levels of complimentarity meaning

554
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:01,519
dissimilarity with neighboring Agland

555
00:20:00,119 --> 00:20:03,319
and so this is evidence that you should

556
00:20:01,519 --> 00:20:05,279
try to retain these Forest fragments in

557
00:20:03,319 --> 00:20:06,839
agricultural Landscapes because the the

558
00:20:05,279 --> 00:20:09,879
beta diversity will be much higher you

559
00:20:06,839 --> 00:20:12,199
have a lot of species turnover however

560
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:14,039
there are some species that readily move

561
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:16,840
across that ecotone and they seem to

562
00:20:14,038 --> 00:20:18,000
influence communities in adjacent Maze

563
00:20:16,839 --> 00:20:19,480
and so the next question would be

564
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,960
interesting to see is if this affects

565
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:24,279
say ecosystem Services if based on your

566
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:26,480
position in the landscape and proximity

567
00:20:24,279 --> 00:20:26,480
to

568
00:20:27,119 --> 00:20:30,639
Forest all right second

569
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:35,919
study this one we look at a much wider

570
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:39,159
range of beneficial taxa because we're

571
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:41,320
including pollinators Predators

572
00:20:39,159 --> 00:20:42,679
parasitoids uh in tree fruit growing

573
00:20:41,319 --> 00:20:44,279
systems so I've been I've been lucky to

574
00:20:42,679 --> 00:20:46,759
get involved in a lot of different

575
00:20:44,279 --> 00:20:48,759
systems uh with a lot of great

576
00:20:46,759 --> 00:20:50,000
collaborators and so I'm partial to this

577
00:20:48,759 --> 00:20:52,440
one because it's where I'm from I'm

578
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,400
actually from Gettysburg Pennsylvania

579
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:56,279
which is in South Central PA in Adams

580
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:58,880
County which is a huge fruit growing

581
00:20:56,279 --> 00:21:01,240
region and so you have these nice sort

582
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:03,200
of Rolling Hills or mountains and it's

583
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:05,038
very conducive to fruit tree production

584
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:07,240
because you put the Orchards on these

585
00:21:05,038 --> 00:21:09,279
slopes and the cold air is able to sink

586
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:10,919
down in the valley to prevent a frost

587
00:21:09,279 --> 00:21:13,079
damage on on the tree so it's very good

588
00:21:10,919 --> 00:21:15,400
growing conditions for apples peaches

589
00:21:13,079 --> 00:21:18,639
cherries what have

590
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:22,679
you and fruit trees are notorious for

591
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:24,320
having a very complex arthropod uh tax I

592
00:21:22,679 --> 00:21:26,320
mean you have a wider range of

593
00:21:24,319 --> 00:21:27,839
beneficials a wider range of pests and

594
00:21:26,319 --> 00:21:29,319
so it's a very interesting system from a

595
00:21:27,839 --> 00:21:31,918
management standpoint

596
00:21:29,319 --> 00:21:34,158
and so uh we were looking at again

597
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:36,159
Predators like you see on the left here

598
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:38,559
everybody knows ladybird beetles they're

599
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:41,039
larv are also very effective

600
00:21:38,558 --> 00:21:42,558
Predators we looked at lacewing larv

601
00:21:41,038 --> 00:21:45,919
they look like little alligators they're

602
00:21:42,558 --> 00:21:48,839
great Predators minute pirate bugs

603
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:50,600
anority spiders and even the larv of

604
00:21:48,839 --> 00:21:52,720
surfit flies those little hover flies

605
00:21:50,599 --> 00:21:55,199
that mimic bees very good

606
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:57,960
Predators we looked at the community of

607
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:59,200
of parasitoids uh members of the family

608
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:02,400
ikumon

609
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:03,880
Bron chalid wasps and then we also

610
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:07,480
looked at bees so anything from

611
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:08,919
bumblebees to Green metallic bees all

612
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:11,360
kinds of different bees which we found

613
00:22:08,919 --> 00:22:13,600
many of in these

614
00:22:11,359 --> 00:22:16,038
systems and so this is part of a

615
00:22:13,599 --> 00:22:17,439
collaboration that's ongoing uh that I

616
00:22:16,038 --> 00:22:19,079
work with people from Penn State from

617
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:22,038
the fruit research Extension Center

618
00:22:19,079 --> 00:22:24,119
especially Dave bidinger um who does a

619
00:22:22,038 --> 00:22:26,200
lot of work down there and a lot of what

620
00:22:24,119 --> 00:22:27,798
we do again is in that ecotoxicology

621
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:29,798
realm where we're looking at how

622
00:22:27,798 --> 00:22:32,359
orthopod community ities respond to P

623
00:22:29,798 --> 00:22:33,759
management practices in tree fruit and

624
00:22:32,359 --> 00:22:37,479
the work I'm going to present today came

625
00:22:33,759 --> 00:22:39,000
out of this program within the USDA ramp

626
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:42,200
uh funding program the risk avoidance

627
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:43,679
and mitigation program and so

628
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:46,480
essentially we're comparing conventional

629
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:48,600
Pest management practices to these newer

630
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:50,640
reduced risk tactics that Growers are

631
00:22:48,599 --> 00:22:52,839
starting to adopt as a result of the

632
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:54,640
food quality protection act so the food

633
00:22:52,839 --> 00:22:56,319
quality protection act suggested phasing

634
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:59,240
out these Organo phosphates and

635
00:22:56,319 --> 00:23:01,480
carbamates which can be toxic to hum and

636
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:04,558
and workers in the field and the reduced

637
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:06,120
risk are supposed to be to be safer uh

638
00:23:04,558 --> 00:23:08,278
and so we're comparing does that

639
00:23:06,119 --> 00:23:10,319
translate into elevated numbers of

640
00:23:08,278 --> 00:23:12,880
beneficial arthropod taex as you switch

641
00:23:10,319 --> 00:23:12,879
to these new

642
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:18,240
programs and so in this system uh

643
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:20,240
throughout Adams County we relied on

644
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:21,759
working with local Growers they allowed

645
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:24,038
us to establish research plots which

646
00:23:21,759 --> 00:23:26,640
were sort of paired blocks of under

647
00:23:24,038 --> 00:23:28,558
standard management or reduced risk

648
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:31,200
programs so reduced risk might include

649
00:23:28,558 --> 00:23:34,480
clude uh the use of pheromones to

650
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:36,798
disrupt mating uh could be anti could be

651
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:38,159
microbials it could also be

652
00:23:36,798 --> 00:23:40,319
neonicotinoids because they're

653
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:42,400
considered lower mamalian

654
00:23:40,319 --> 00:23:44,599
toxicity uh a wide range of different

655
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:46,080
products whereas the standard plots were

656
00:23:44,599 --> 00:23:48,599
mainly managed with the Organo

657
00:23:46,079 --> 00:23:50,759
phosphates carbamates and

658
00:23:48,599 --> 00:23:52,480
pyrethroids and so we wanted to look at

659
00:23:50,759 --> 00:23:54,079
the response of the beneficial community

660
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:56,839
so for predators and

661
00:23:54,079 --> 00:23:58,240
parasitoids uh we used a bug Vac

662
00:23:56,839 --> 00:23:59,879
entomologists get to use these cool

663
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:01,759
things things like this it's a leaf

664
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:04,480
blower with an inverted fun function and

665
00:24:01,759 --> 00:24:06,839
we just basically got all the insects

666
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:08,919
off the tree as we would we walk around

667
00:24:06,839 --> 00:24:10,319
and then the bees we use pant traps

668
00:24:08,919 --> 00:24:12,799
which you may be familiar with are

669
00:24:10,319 --> 00:24:15,079
basically colored bowls blue and yellow

670
00:24:12,798 --> 00:24:16,639
and white highly attractive to bees that

671
00:24:15,079 --> 00:24:18,720
have a little soapy water breaks the

672
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:20,720
surface tension and it's able to catch

673
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:23,240
bees that way so two different sampling

674
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:26,240
methods and we're looking at uh the

675
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:26,240
beneficial Community

676
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:31,320
here so what about differences in Pest

677
00:24:29,119 --> 00:24:33,918
Management again we use the systems

678
00:24:31,319 --> 00:24:34,918
based sort of real world approach uh

679
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:37,278
Dave

680
00:24:34,919 --> 00:24:39,799
bidinger uh acted as the Scout and the

681
00:24:37,278 --> 00:24:41,079
guide as far as pesticide inputs and so

682
00:24:39,798 --> 00:24:42,879
we kept track of what the different

683
00:24:41,079 --> 00:24:45,398
Growers use for the different needs in

684
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:47,278
the different locations and really what

685
00:24:45,398 --> 00:24:50,038
I want to point out here is the DraStic

686
00:24:47,278 --> 00:24:51,880
reduction from 95 to 50% in Organo

687
00:24:50,038 --> 00:24:54,480
phosphates and carbamates when you

688
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:56,440
compare the standard versus the reduced

689
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:59,038
risk uh here are some of the reduced

690
00:24:56,440 --> 00:25:01,320
risk inputs and then another thing I

691
00:24:59,038 --> 00:25:03,480
want to highlight just total pounds of

692
00:25:01,319 --> 00:25:06,278
active ingredient per acre by adopting

693
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:08,319
reduced risk Technologies you reduce per

694
00:25:06,278 --> 00:25:11,759
acre 5 and a half pounds of active

695
00:25:08,319 --> 00:25:13,639
ingredient and so a real drastic change

696
00:25:11,759 --> 00:25:15,079
we used the environmental impact

697
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:18,200
quotient uh for the different

698
00:25:15,079 --> 00:25:20,519
insecticides provided by Cornell uh New

699
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:22,120
York IPM program where you can sort of

700
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:25,200
get this general idea of environmental

701
00:25:22,119 --> 00:25:27,038
impact because it includes the idea of

702
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:28,840
persistence in the environment effects

703
00:25:27,038 --> 00:25:31,398
of mammals fish

704
00:25:28,839 --> 00:25:33,879
arthropods pollinators all kinds of

705
00:25:31,398 --> 00:25:36,678
things and we had an 83% reduction in

706
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:39,720
this idea of environmental

707
00:25:36,679 --> 00:25:43,240
impact so did this translate into more

708
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:45,880
beneficial arthopods in our tree fruit

709
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:47,880
systems uh we got a different story

710
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:49,840
depending on which group we looked at so

711
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:52,399
here's one of those redundancy analyses

712
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:53,798
where we could look at uh do the

713
00:25:52,398 --> 00:25:56,599
communities respond to different

714
00:25:53,798 --> 00:25:58,000
treatment variables and what I want to

715
00:25:56,599 --> 00:26:00,599
draw your attention to are these darken

716
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,720
squ the ramp would be the reduced risk

717
00:26:00,599 --> 00:26:04,599
and the the standard is obviously the

718
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:06,038
conventional management and you can see

719
00:26:04,599 --> 00:26:07,678
all these vectors represent all the

720
00:26:06,038 --> 00:26:09,398
different beneficial groups within

721
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:11,798
predators and parasitoids and the

722
00:26:09,398 --> 00:26:13,319
general Trend here is very Stark right

723
00:26:11,798 --> 00:26:15,240
you can see they're all trending towards

724
00:26:13,319 --> 00:26:17,439
the reduced risk

725
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:19,640
plots found a significant effect of

726
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:20,960
treatment such that the vast majority of

727
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:23,559
the beneficial Community were found in

728
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:26,240
higher abundances in the reduced risk

729
00:26:23,558 --> 00:26:27,480
Fields as opposed to Conventional Fields

730
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:29,480
some of these oddballs over here are

731
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:31,599
actually species which seem to be

732
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:34,240
uncorrelated so equal abundance is

733
00:26:31,599 --> 00:26:37,918
regardless of system so this you have

734
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:40,798
branid wasps ID wasps green lacewing

735
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:44,038
Predators minute pirate bugs ladybird

736
00:26:40,798 --> 00:26:46,359
beetles assassin bugs great names for

737
00:26:44,038 --> 00:26:48,599
these spiders all much higher in the

738
00:26:46,359 --> 00:26:51,359
reduced

739
00:26:48,599 --> 00:26:53,000
risk so as far as the pollinators or the

740
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:56,000
wild bees we looked at we actually got a

741
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:57,640
different story so here you can see you

742
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,679
look at these axis you have standard

743
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:00,880
versus ramp they're both clustered right

744
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:02,240
near the center of the bip plot which

745
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:04,399
means they have a very low effect size

746
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:07,278
and we found no effect of Pest

747
00:27:04,398 --> 00:27:08,678
Management program on wild bees however

748
00:27:07,278 --> 00:27:09,839
these triangles you see all around the

749
00:27:08,679 --> 00:27:11,278
perimeter here those are the different

750
00:27:09,839 --> 00:27:13,879
locations those are just the grower

751
00:27:11,278 --> 00:27:15,759
names and you can see we got widely

752
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:17,799
Divergent communities depending on

753
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:21,480
location in the landscape as shown by

754
00:27:17,798 --> 00:27:24,000
the different Growers so for example so

755
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:26,079
again no effective treatment however for

756
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,919
example peponapis prosa you may

757
00:27:26,079 --> 00:27:30,398
recognize as the squash B so we

758
00:27:28,919 --> 00:27:31,679
collected that near this Harner Farm

759
00:27:30,398 --> 00:27:33,719
there he must have been near some

760
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:34,919
agricultural Fields with a lot of cbits

761
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:37,440
it's the only reason I can think of to

762
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:40,320
catch that you have other things like

763
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:41,798
Catina osmia which require sort of a

764
00:27:40,319 --> 00:27:44,678
structurally complex environment because

765
00:27:41,798 --> 00:27:47,240
they're cavity nesters in wood and so

766
00:27:44,679 --> 00:27:49,000
the diely may have been located next to

767
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:49,798
a forest edge or something like that so

768
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,398
this is something we're actually

769
00:27:49,798 --> 00:27:53,759
pursuing right now is looking at

770
00:27:51,398 --> 00:27:57,158
landscape predictors for wild be

771
00:27:53,759 --> 00:27:59,599
diversity within um Orchard systems and

772
00:27:57,159 --> 00:28:01,120
so this is sort of anecdotal evidence or

773
00:27:59,599 --> 00:28:05,240
suggests that the landscape is what's

774
00:28:01,119 --> 00:28:05,239
driving be diversity in our our

775
00:28:05,359 --> 00:28:09,839
Orchards and just to drive home the

776
00:28:08,519 --> 00:28:11,919
difference between treatment and sight

777
00:28:09,839 --> 00:28:14,278
location again these are those rare

778
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:16,600
faction curves species accumulation

779
00:28:14,278 --> 00:28:17,960
comparing B diversity between reduced

780
00:28:16,599 --> 00:28:20,639
risk and standard they overlap

781
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:21,919
completely no difference in diversity

782
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:23,399
however when you look across site

783
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:25,799
locations you get widely different

784
00:28:23,398 --> 00:28:28,558
things as far as the number of bees

785
00:28:25,798 --> 00:28:30,798
collected to the number of species found

786
00:28:28,558 --> 00:28:32,000
even at standardized level so

787
00:28:30,798 --> 00:28:34,038
something's going on at the at the

788
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:37,038
landscape

789
00:28:34,038 --> 00:28:39,480
level so some conclusions from the ramp

790
00:28:37,038 --> 00:28:40,960
reduced risk study so Trends associated

791
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:43,759
with adoption of reduced risk tactics

792
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:45,720
were established in this agnolo paper

793
00:28:43,759 --> 00:28:47,398
from which researchers at Cornell were

794
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:49,640
also involved this was a multi-state

795
00:28:47,398 --> 00:28:51,398
study up the Eastern seab board looking

796
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:53,679
at how what it means to adopt to reduce

797
00:28:51,398 --> 00:28:55,599
risk pesticides or Pest Management

798
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:58,320
Programs overall they lower the

799
00:28:55,599 --> 00:29:00,558
insecticide loow load they an

800
00:28:58,319 --> 00:29:03,000
environmental impact however they are

801
00:29:00,558 --> 00:29:04,678
more expensive on average to implement

802
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,919
so our study was sort of a followup

803
00:29:04,679 --> 00:29:08,919
what's going on with the beneficial

804
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:11,120
arthropod community and it does seem

805
00:29:08,919 --> 00:29:13,240
that reduced risk tactics support

806
00:29:11,119 --> 00:29:14,959
beneficial arthropods especially those

807
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:17,599
providing biological control not

808
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:19,399
necessarily the pollinators and so to

809
00:29:17,599 --> 00:29:21,319
address this idea of being more

810
00:29:19,398 --> 00:29:23,038
expensive one question we have is

811
00:29:21,319 --> 00:29:24,278
possibly over time with the

812
00:29:23,038 --> 00:29:25,879
establishment of these biological

813
00:29:24,278 --> 00:29:27,839
control services you might be able to

814
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:29,360
offset some of those added costs of the

815
00:29:27,839 --> 00:29:32,558
dck those Technologies we build up a

816
00:29:29,359 --> 00:29:34,719
real strong biological control

817
00:29:32,558 --> 00:29:36,639
community and we actually uh if you're

818
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:38,440
interested in this it looks cut off but

819
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:40,320
we just published a paper in Journal of

820
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:42,679
economic entomology that describes this

821
00:29:40,319 --> 00:29:44,678
this ramp

822
00:29:42,679 --> 00:29:45,960
study and then since the theme of my

823
00:29:44,679 --> 00:29:47,440
talk is sort of this local versus

824
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:49,079
landscape just to summarize that

825
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:50,440
predators and parasitoids responded

826
00:29:49,079 --> 00:29:52,439
strongly to local Pest management

827
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:55,159
practices we believe that because they

828
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:56,360
have limited mobility and they also have

829
00:29:55,159 --> 00:29:58,200
strong associations with what they're

830
00:29:56,359 --> 00:29:59,678
feeding on or what their hosts are for

831
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:01,360
the parasitoids that are found in the

832
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:04,200
orchard right so they have incentive to

833
00:30:01,359 --> 00:30:07,079
stay local the bees are operating on a

834
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:09,319
different scale uh evidence of this was

835
00:30:07,079 --> 00:30:10,678
a recent paper showing that you can

836
00:30:09,319 --> 00:30:12,158
actually predict be diversity in

837
00:30:10,679 --> 00:30:15,519
Orchards based on the percent of

838
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:17,360
forested area at a th meter radius bees

839
00:30:15,519 --> 00:30:18,960
obviously have greater dispersal

840
00:30:17,359 --> 00:30:21,000
capabilities and throughout their

841
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:22,720
lifetime they're relying on multiple

842
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,278
feeding resources their nesting

843
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:26,038
resources are often going to be outside

844
00:30:24,278 --> 00:30:27,759
the orchard as well they might just be

845
00:30:26,038 --> 00:30:30,720
coming into the orchard during uh Bloom

846
00:30:27,759 --> 00:30:30,720
Peri right for

847
00:30:32,278 --> 00:30:38,398
resources and then the last one I'll

848
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:40,240
transition to an urban setting and here

849
00:30:38,398 --> 00:30:41,558
uh when I came to Liu I knew I wanted to

850
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:44,240
do something maybe in the community

851
00:30:41,558 --> 00:30:46,359
garden setting and I was starting to get

852
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:47,839
interested in in bees and be diversity

853
00:30:46,359 --> 00:30:50,158
so here we were looking at Community

854
00:30:47,839 --> 00:30:52,558
Gardens and how they support wild be

855
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:54,600
communities in a heavily urbanized

856
00:30:52,558 --> 00:30:56,879
setting the urban is sort of used

857
00:30:54,599 --> 00:30:58,638
Loosely in the literature New York is a

858
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:01,039
very you know Metropolis

859
00:30:58,638 --> 00:31:02,158
with heavily urbanized sitting so the

860
00:31:01,038 --> 00:31:04,519
New York City

861
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:07,120
Gardens you see a lot of raised bed

862
00:31:04,519 --> 00:31:09,960
although not all some have some row

863
00:31:07,119 --> 00:31:12,119
cropping and communal sort of gardening

864
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:15,079
but in general you get situations like

865
00:31:12,119 --> 00:31:16,879
this um there are over 700 Community

866
00:31:15,079 --> 00:31:18,439
Gardens in New York city so and it's

867
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:20,480
growing the number so put together that

868
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:22,120
represents a large portion of the

869
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:24,639
landscape and if you look at the

870
00:31:22,119 --> 00:31:27,439
surrounding landscape almost 70% of it

871
00:31:24,638 --> 00:31:30,918
is impervious surface right so as far as

872
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:34,038
resources for for bees they could be

873
00:31:30,919 --> 00:31:36,399
limited and people growing food in the

874
00:31:34,038 --> 00:31:39,079
city just like anybody else can benefit

875
00:31:36,398 --> 00:31:41,319
from insect derived ecosystem Services

876
00:31:39,079 --> 00:31:43,519
whether it be biological control or

877
00:31:41,319 --> 00:31:46,359
pollination in this case so I focused on

878
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:48,399
bees and a study by Kevin Madison and

879
00:31:46,359 --> 00:31:51,359
Gail leleto found that of the commonly

880
00:31:48,398 --> 00:31:53,119
grown crops there over 90% benefit from

881
00:31:51,359 --> 00:31:56,359
be pollination Services maybe not

882
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:59,439
totally rely on but at least benefit

883
00:31:56,359 --> 00:32:01,319
from so the group studied were wild bees

884
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:02,919
like a bumblebee here although there

885
00:32:01,319 --> 00:32:05,599
five different families you might

886
00:32:02,919 --> 00:32:07,720
collect uh we used again different

887
00:32:05,599 --> 00:32:09,839
trapping methods to see what was out

888
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:12,120
there so here's a a bumblebee visiting a

889
00:32:09,839 --> 00:32:12,119
bud

890
00:32:12,359 --> 00:32:16,638
lasia and so the the study was

891
00:32:14,798 --> 00:32:19,038
relatively straightforward so we had

892
00:32:16,638 --> 00:32:20,479
these three basic research questions and

893
00:32:19,038 --> 00:32:23,079
I worked with some undergraduate

894
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:25,240
students at Liu on this project uh the

895
00:32:23,079 --> 00:32:27,079
first one was what bees are found in

896
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:29,558
Brooklyn New York Community Gardens

897
00:32:27,079 --> 00:32:31,839
because thing that I try to include in

898
00:32:29,558 --> 00:32:34,359
all these studies is species level

899
00:32:31,839 --> 00:32:36,199
identification to establish Baseline

900
00:32:34,359 --> 00:32:39,000
information you know sometimes we want

901
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:42,200
to answer these bigger questions and we

902
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:43,359
put the right the cart before the horse

903
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:44,720
right when we don't even know what's out

904
00:32:43,359 --> 00:32:46,599
there and in fact to some of these very

905
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:48,639
common systems we're finding new species

906
00:32:46,599 --> 00:32:50,119
still to this day and so the first thing

907
00:32:48,638 --> 00:32:52,479
I try to always do is work with

908
00:32:50,119 --> 00:32:53,879
taxonomist get everything identified

909
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:55,159
this Baseline information could be used

910
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:56,760
in the future to see how communities

911
00:32:55,159 --> 00:32:58,760
change for example in response to

912
00:32:56,759 --> 00:33:01,079
climate change and so these historical

913
00:32:58,759 --> 00:33:02,960
data are very important the second

914
00:33:01,079 --> 00:33:04,599
question was does be diversity differ

915
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:06,919
among Community Gardens throughout

916
00:33:04,599 --> 00:33:08,278
Brooklyn New York so it seems like a

917
00:33:06,919 --> 00:33:11,000
simple question but we thought it could

918
00:33:08,278 --> 00:33:12,398
be possible that due to the severeness

919
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,919
of the landscape the severity of the

920
00:33:12,398 --> 00:33:15,638
landscape that you just have a small

921
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:16,759
group of generalist species and you no

922
00:33:15,638 --> 00:33:19,519
matter what you do in your garden you

923
00:33:16,759 --> 00:33:21,440
get the same small group of these but

924
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:23,159
assuming we did find a difference our

925
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:24,960
third question was then can we build a

926
00:33:23,159 --> 00:33:27,200
model a simple model just describing

927
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:29,038
what environmental factors best explain

928
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:31,000
variation of diversity among Gardens and

929
00:33:29,038 --> 00:33:33,519
we included both local variables and

930
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:36,159
Landscape variables and sort of had them

931
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:36,159
uh both

932
00:33:36,398 --> 00:33:41,719
included so we established research

933
00:33:39,079 --> 00:33:43,240
sites uh throughout Brooklyn this is a

934
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:45,558
sing this makes me a little sad because

935
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:48,120
it's just a single slide but as Megan

936
00:33:45,558 --> 00:33:50,038
can attest this is a huge project

937
00:33:48,119 --> 00:33:52,119
because you have to procure Keys you

938
00:33:50,038 --> 00:33:53,519
have to get there right you can't carry

939
00:33:52,119 --> 00:33:55,119
all your nets and Equipment always on

940
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:57,038
the subway so you're driving and trying

941
00:33:55,119 --> 00:33:58,319
to find parking and it can be a huge

942
00:33:57,038 --> 00:34:01,398
headache

943
00:33:58,319 --> 00:34:02,480
so we uh compared to Megan's work which

944
00:34:01,398 --> 00:34:03,959
you may be familiar with this was a

945
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:05,038
smaller scale again because I I was

946
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:07,240
typically working with just one other

947
00:34:05,038 --> 00:34:10,719
student so we had a sites that were

948
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:12,878
spatially distinct and we tried to

949
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:15,319
include sites that approached land use

950
00:34:12,878 --> 00:34:16,878
in different ways so typically your

951
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:19,480
community garden may be the size of a

952
00:34:16,878 --> 00:34:20,759
single home plot maybe it burned down 50

953
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:23,000
years ago and they put in a community

954
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:24,760
garden others like East New York Farms

955
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:28,079
here is about the size of a half a city

956
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:31,520
block so size land use plant divers we

957
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:31,519
try to include a wide range of different

958
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:37,760
variables B sampling right the best part

959
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:40,119
why you become an entomologist uh we did

960
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:41,800
for two years we sampled the bees

961
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:43,800
bi-weekly we used the pant traps again

962
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:45,760
which is a passive technique so they're

963
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:48,320
just attracted to those bowls and then

964
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:50,200
we also wanted to use net sampling where

965
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:53,000
we actively scouted for bees and we

966
00:34:50,199 --> 00:34:55,878
tried to cover the whole extent of the

967
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:58,320
card and again everything identified as

968
00:34:55,878 --> 00:35:00,159
species we received a lot help from John

969
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:02,440
Asher at the Museum of Natural History

970
00:35:00,159 --> 00:35:03,759
although he's not there anymore but he

971
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:06,960
identified a lot of Beast for us and

972
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:06,960
verified them all the species

973
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:11,200
level and then while we're doing the

974
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:13,520
collecting while we're in the gardens we

975
00:35:11,199 --> 00:35:14,919
concurrently also measured environmental

976
00:35:13,519 --> 00:35:17,199
factors that can be used as predictors

977
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:19,240
in the model and uh we kept it

978
00:35:17,199 --> 00:35:21,519
relatively simple so at the local level

979
00:35:19,239 --> 00:35:23,039
we looked at the size of the garden we

980
00:35:21,519 --> 00:35:27,199
looked at percent area and the different

981
00:35:23,039 --> 00:35:29,358
land uses cropping areas non-rop areas

982
00:35:27,199 --> 00:35:31,319
we also used plant diversity which was

983
00:35:29,358 --> 00:35:33,400
just measured as total species

984
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:35,480
richness so I had people say from the

985
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:37,079
Brooklyn Botanical Garden come with me

986
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:39,880
would walk around and just identify as

987
00:35:37,079 --> 00:35:42,560
many plants as we could at each location

988
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:44,079
and then light availability which was uh

989
00:35:42,559 --> 00:35:46,719
we use this hemispheric photography

990
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:48,119
which was introduced to me Thea Megan uh

991
00:35:46,719 --> 00:35:49,439
but this is a great way light

992
00:35:48,119 --> 00:35:50,920
availability isn't something you maybe

993
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:52,800
consider that much in other settings but

994
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:55,039
in an urban setting especially New York

995
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:57,000
which is so such a vertical City it can

996
00:35:55,039 --> 00:35:58,400
have huge effects on the community right

997
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,159
if you have a tall building right next

998
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:03,318
to your garden it could be cast in shade

999
00:36:00,159 --> 00:36:04,960
for half the day so this hemispheric

1000
00:36:03,318 --> 00:36:07,440
photography allowed you to get a picture

1001
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:09,358
from Horizon to Horizon and there is

1002
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:10,960
certain software that you import the

1003
00:36:09,358 --> 00:36:12,318
pictures and it calculates the amount of

1004
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:13,400
light intensity over the course of the

1005
00:36:12,318 --> 00:36:16,838
whole growing

1006
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:18,440
season and at the landscape level uh

1007
00:36:16,838 --> 00:36:20,078
again we kept it relatively simple we

1008
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:21,200
had our garden like you have here in the

1009
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:25,039
middle and we looked at two different

1010
00:36:21,199 --> 00:36:27,118
radi 200 M 500 M and we just calculated

1011
00:36:25,039 --> 00:36:29,239
total amount of Green Space we broke it

1012
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:32,480
up into two canopy this would be like

1013
00:36:29,239 --> 00:36:36,078
Street trees and then open green areas

1014
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:36,079
which we we simply called grassy

1015
00:36:37,519 --> 00:36:41,079
areas so I'm going to go through the

1016
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:43,240
results just based on the three research

1017
00:36:41,079 --> 00:36:45,880
questions so the first one was what bees

1018
00:36:43,239 --> 00:36:47,078
are found in Brooklyn Gardens uh so

1019
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:50,079
through our two years of sampling we

1020
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:51,839
collected over, 1600 bees found 50

1021
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:55,200
different species including one that had

1022
00:36:51,838 --> 00:36:57,960
never been found in Brooklyn before uh

1023
00:36:55,199 --> 00:37:01,199
18% of the 50 species were exotic is

1024
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:03,960
that a lot yes it's a lot that's

1025
00:37:01,199 --> 00:37:06,279
basically nine species there are I think

1026
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:07,760
around 20 to 22 nonnative species of

1027
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:09,400
bees catalogued in North America so we

1028
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:10,920
found nearly half of them in our New

1029
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:14,079
York City

1030
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:16,119
Gardens um this trend was documented by

1031
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:19,318
also by Kevin Madison who did a similar

1032
00:37:16,119 --> 00:37:21,039
be study in the Bronx but this is just

1033
00:37:19,318 --> 00:37:22,920
such an interesting example of how human

1034
00:37:21,039 --> 00:37:25,000
modified Landscapes affect community

1035
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:26,519
structure because there are a lot of

1036
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,838
bees out there if you're not familiar

1037
00:37:26,519 --> 00:37:31,400
there are almost 20,000 species of bees

1038
00:37:28,838 --> 00:37:33,000
globally more than species of fish and

1039
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:34,599
most of them are not social like honey

1040
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:37,039
bees which most people think of but

1041
00:37:34,599 --> 00:37:39,000
they're solitary and most of them nest

1042
00:37:37,039 --> 00:37:40,639
in the soil for example so if you go

1043
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:42,358
outside the city the majority of species

1044
00:37:40,639 --> 00:37:44,838
you find would tend to be the solitary

1045
00:37:42,358 --> 00:37:46,440
soil nesters you get an inverse

1046
00:37:44,838 --> 00:37:48,318
community structure in the city in that

1047
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:50,480
most are cavity nesters just because

1048
00:37:48,318 --> 00:37:54,119
there's not a lot of available soil as I

1049
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:55,838
said about 70% of New York is impervious

1050
00:37:54,119 --> 00:37:58,440
surface and then here are the different

1051
00:37:55,838 --> 00:37:59,519
be is a wide range from bbus andati is

1052
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:02,679
your eastern

1053
00:37:59,519 --> 00:38:06,000
bumblebee peponapis prosa is a squash B

1054
00:38:02,679 --> 00:38:08,879
so you have a a range of generalist some

1055
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:10,760
EG Specialists and just a wide range of

1056
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:12,960
diversity

1057
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:14,720
here the second question does be

1058
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:16,599
diversity vary among Gardens this is

1059
00:38:14,719 --> 00:38:18,039
something we were a little unsure of and

1060
00:38:16,599 --> 00:38:20,640
the resounding answer is that yes it

1061
00:38:18,039 --> 00:38:23,039
does greatly so uh if you look at the

1062
00:38:20,639 --> 00:38:24,679
top part of this table abundance this is

1063
00:38:23,039 --> 00:38:26,679
two years worth of data so we had a

1064
00:38:24,679 --> 00:38:29,679
garden that we collected for two years

1065
00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:31,639
bi-weekly UL we collected 18 bees

1066
00:38:29,679 --> 00:38:34,039
another one we collected nearly 300

1067
00:38:31,639 --> 00:38:36,078
right so drastic differences species

1068
00:38:34,039 --> 00:38:39,639
richness one one Garden only seven

1069
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:40,720
different species of bees another 37 and

1070
00:38:39,639 --> 00:38:42,279
so if you look at the Garden

1071
00:38:40,719 --> 00:38:43,679
characteristics we felt pretty confident

1072
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:45,359
that we could build some type of model

1073
00:38:43,679 --> 00:38:48,799
to explain this because the gardens also

1074
00:38:45,358 --> 00:38:51,039
varied widely from very small to very

1075
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:54,000
large uh plant diversity range from

1076
00:38:51,039 --> 00:38:55,559
about 50 to over 150 species some of

1077
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,440
these places I would call like hyper

1078
00:38:55,559 --> 00:38:58,400
diverse just the gardeners pled many

1079
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:01,838
many different

1080
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:03,440
ples light availability widely Divergent

1081
00:39:01,838 --> 00:39:05,599
and then even landscape context had some

1082
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:09,519
variability as

1083
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:11,200
well so for question three are there

1084
00:39:09,519 --> 00:39:12,639
environmental predictors of B diversity

1085
00:39:11,199 --> 00:39:15,199
we we used a multiple regression

1086
00:39:12,639 --> 00:39:16,598
approach with Ford selection just to get

1087
00:39:15,199 --> 00:39:18,279
the smallest number of variables that

1088
00:39:16,599 --> 00:39:20,480
best explain the different be diversity

1089
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:22,160
measures and so we looked at abundance

1090
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:25,159
species richness and then we used a

1091
00:39:22,159 --> 00:39:28,039
diversity index for the bees as our

1092
00:39:25,159 --> 00:39:29,358
response and so for be abundance

1093
00:39:28,039 --> 00:39:32,358
that's just total number of bees

1094
00:39:29,358 --> 00:39:34,598
regardless of species uh you could

1095
00:39:32,358 --> 00:39:36,799
accurately predict that using light

1096
00:39:34,599 --> 00:39:39,039
availability and plant species

1097
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:40,240
richness I include the coefficients here

1098
00:39:39,039 --> 00:39:42,039
so you can sort of think about what that

1099
00:39:40,239 --> 00:39:43,838
relationship would be so for you know

1100
00:39:42,039 --> 00:39:47,800
for every additional plant species you

1101
00:39:43,838 --> 00:39:49,559
gain a b you have a coefficient of one

1102
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:52,039
and then as the diversity measures get

1103
00:39:49,559 --> 00:39:54,960
more complex so do the models a bit you

1104
00:39:52,039 --> 00:39:57,079
see if you want to know about B richness

1105
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:58,599
the total number of different species

1106
00:39:57,079 --> 00:40:00,680
again plant species richness and light

1107
00:39:58,599 --> 00:40:03,119
availability are important but you also

1108
00:40:00,679 --> 00:40:05,318
get this factor in with the uh landscape

1109
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:08,920
context as well which makes sense if you

1110
00:40:05,318 --> 00:40:10,960
think about it if you have a food Rich

1111
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:13,200
very a lot of light availability you

1112
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:14,920
might get a lot of activity of bees but

1113
00:40:13,199 --> 00:40:16,399
you may not get a wide diversity whereas

1114
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:18,358
bringing in the surrounding landscape

1115
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:20,200
context if you have a lot of Green Space

1116
00:40:18,358 --> 00:40:22,440
you have many different nesting

1117
00:40:20,199 --> 00:40:23,838
resources alternative food resources and

1118
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:26,838
you just might catch a larger number of

1119
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:29,000
these and then the diversity index again

1120
00:40:26,838 --> 00:40:30,599
those same three and also Garden area

1121
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:32,639
seem to be a predictor for diversity

1122
00:40:30,599 --> 00:40:34,880
which includes both richness and

1123
00:40:32,639 --> 00:40:36,440
evenness so maybe more ecological niche

1124
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:39,480
space for the bees allows them to be a

1125
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:39,480
bit more even in that

1126
00:40:40,119 --> 00:40:44,519
context so what were some of the

1127
00:40:42,199 --> 00:40:45,799
conclusions uh the diversity and

1128
00:40:44,519 --> 00:40:47,039
community structure of the community was

1129
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:49,359
definitely influenced by the urban

1130
00:40:47,039 --> 00:40:51,480
setting in that we found lower species

1131
00:40:49,358 --> 00:40:54,440
richness than you might Elsewhere for

1132
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:56,519
example our research in tree fruit again

1133
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:58,519
you have a a pretty standardized

1134
00:40:56,519 --> 00:41:00,599
cropping system we found well over 100

1135
00:40:58,519 --> 00:41:01,960
species of bees there so this Urban

1136
00:41:00,599 --> 00:41:04,119
setting really lowers the species

1137
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:06,119
richness and you get the fewer number of

1138
00:41:04,119 --> 00:41:06,960
soil nesting species and a high number

1139
00:41:06,119 --> 00:41:10,079
of

1140
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:12,240
Exotics the gardens vary greatly in be

1141
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:13,640
diversity and land use patterns so that

1142
00:41:12,239 --> 00:41:16,439
maybe there's the opportunity there for

1143
00:41:13,639 --> 00:41:17,279
Gardens to augment more bees by changing

1144
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:19,480
some

1145
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:21,280
practices and we found that be diversity

1146
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:22,880
could be strongly predicted by local

1147
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:25,040
factors such as floral diversity and

1148
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:27,400
light availability and to some extent

1149
00:41:25,039 --> 00:41:28,759
landscape context plays a role as those

1150
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:31,880
were included in the models for B

1151
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:34,359
richness and diversity and one result I

1152
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:36,920
didn't share but again we employed those

1153
00:41:34,358 --> 00:41:39,119
similarity indices there's a lot of data

1154
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:41,400
out there on bees in the city parks like

1155
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:43,559
Central Park and Prospect Park from John

1156
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:45,079
Asher at the Museum Natural History so

1157
00:41:43,559 --> 00:41:46,159
we did some similarity indices to

1158
00:41:45,079 --> 00:41:48,680
compare what we were finding in

1159
00:41:46,159 --> 00:41:50,000
Community Gardens to city parks and we

1160
00:41:48,679 --> 00:41:51,960
found substantial amounts of

1161
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,960
dissimilarity you think that's driven

1162
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:55,519
because the plant diversity is different

1163
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:57,159
you get these a species and there are

1164
00:41:55,519 --> 00:41:59,199
several bees that are Specialists of C

1165
00:41:57,159 --> 00:42:02,480
certain egg species such as the squash

1166
00:41:59,199 --> 00:42:04,960
bee peponapis pinosa the sunflower bee

1167
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:06,800
melodis agilis and so with these new

1168
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:08,480
resources without those Community

1169
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:10,480
Gardens there those bees species would

1170
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:13,318
probably not be present in New York City

1171
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:16,920
at all so uh reason to support Community

1172
00:42:13,318 --> 00:42:16,920
Gardens and put more of them in the

1173
00:42:17,358 --> 00:42:21,358
city and then I wanted to use the

1174
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:22,920
opportunity since I did go through three

1175
00:42:21,358 --> 00:42:25,679
different completely different systems

1176
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:27,960
just some overall closing thoughts from

1177
00:42:25,679 --> 00:42:29,399
doing these Community level work so one

1178
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:31,000
is despite the fact that I mentioned

1179
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:32,880
that there's lower species richness in

1180
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:35,358
these settings it was still surprising

1181
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:37,720
the amount of diversity we did find when

1182
00:42:35,358 --> 00:42:39,639
we first started the work in the Maze

1183
00:42:37,719 --> 00:42:41,159
ecosystems on the transgenic maze

1184
00:42:39,639 --> 00:42:42,480
somebody commented that why would you

1185
00:42:41,159 --> 00:42:44,879
want to study diversity out there it's

1186
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:47,920
it's a baren landscape you know we found

1187
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:49,559
over 50 species of beetles so we should

1188
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:51,318
view these managed Landscapes as a place

1189
00:42:49,559 --> 00:42:52,920
to conserve biodiversity and there's

1190
00:42:51,318 --> 00:42:54,759
increasing evidence that cities can even

1191
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:57,639
host a large amount of

1192
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:58,920
biodiversity and then we also Community

1193
00:42:57,639 --> 00:43:01,159
level Works important and that

1194
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:03,000
investment into taxonomy is important to

1195
00:43:01,159 --> 00:43:05,318
establish Baseline data as we have a

1196
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:08,039
rapidly and changing environments again

1197
00:43:05,318 --> 00:43:10,000
due to climate change or urbanization's

1198
00:43:08,039 --> 00:43:11,279
going to expand agricultural production

1199
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,519
is going to expand with the growing

1200
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:14,960
human population so there's so much out

1201
00:43:13,519 --> 00:43:17,079
there we just don't even know about

1202
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:19,720
insect diversity it's important to get

1203
00:43:17,079 --> 00:43:21,240
these Baseline data the problem is we're

1204
00:43:19,719 --> 00:43:22,759
in the middle of a taxonomic bottleneck

1205
00:43:21,239 --> 00:43:25,199
where we have fewer and fewer taxonomist

1206
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:28,079
that can actually identify these little

1207
00:43:25,199 --> 00:43:31,078
critters uh the second broader

1208
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:33,400
Point uh these ecotoxicological studies

1209
00:43:31,079 --> 00:43:34,720
reveal that sometimes species respond

1210
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:37,480
differently than other species in the

1211
00:43:34,719 --> 00:43:39,959
community to these treatment factors and

1212
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:41,358
so we believe especially I've had this

1213
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:43,358
conversation with Dave bidinger that

1214
00:43:41,358 --> 00:43:45,318
there needs to be a role for these

1215
00:43:43,358 --> 00:43:48,960
realistic systems-based Community level

1216
00:43:45,318 --> 00:43:50,679
studies field studies in risk assessment

1217
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:53,838
uh for example in registering pesticides

1218
00:43:50,679 --> 00:43:55,440
or things like that the EPA might use

1219
00:43:53,838 --> 00:43:57,239
honeybee as a surrogate for all

1220
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:59,358
pollinators

1221
00:43:57,239 --> 00:44:00,838
and we see that we get widely different

1222
00:43:59,358 --> 00:44:03,078
responses to different things among

1223
00:44:00,838 --> 00:44:04,358
different species and so we know that

1224
00:44:03,079 --> 00:44:06,359
you have to have a realistic approach

1225
00:44:04,358 --> 00:44:07,799
because you can't test everything

1226
00:44:06,358 --> 00:44:09,279
however we believe these Community level

1227
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:11,960
studies if you can invest the time and

1228
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:13,880
resources could serve to augment those

1229
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:15,358
normal practices and there's also

1230
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:18,280
increasing evidence coming out with bees

1231
00:44:15,358 --> 00:44:21,358
of synergisms between pesticides and

1232
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:24,040
fungicides even adant like oils or

1233
00:44:21,358 --> 00:44:26,078
adhesives that can affect toxicity and

1234
00:44:24,039 --> 00:44:27,400
you really don't pick that up unless

1235
00:44:26,079 --> 00:44:28,800
right because you can't do every single

1236
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:30,160
combination in the lab you pick that up

1237
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:32,000
though in the field what's really going

1238
00:44:30,159 --> 00:44:34,279
on these different

1239
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:35,559
tpan and then the last one is that the

1240
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:38,760
relative influence of the surrounding

1241
00:44:35,559 --> 00:44:39,920
landscape in any given system uh varies

1242
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:41,800
based on the ecological needs and

1243
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:43,559
dispersal of whatever taxonomic group

1244
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:46,200
you're working with or or Guild you're

1245
00:44:43,559 --> 00:44:47,800
working with U for example the bees were

1246
00:44:46,199 --> 00:44:49,480
responding at a much larger scale than

1247
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:52,480
the Predators and parasitoids and our

1248
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:55,000
tree fruit systems so uh in the tree

1249
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:56,400
fruit again we're working with funding

1250
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:58,480
from the specialty crop research

1251
00:44:56,400 --> 00:45:01,680
initiative us SDA on looking at those

1252
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:04,440
landscape factors also getting from nrcs

1253
00:45:01,679 --> 00:45:06,558
some seed mixes of pollinator Habitat to

1254
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:08,639
establish next to Orchards and see if

1255
00:45:06,559 --> 00:45:11,079
you can get things food resources for

1256
00:45:08,639 --> 00:45:14,239
before and after Apple Bloom per se to

1257
00:45:11,079 --> 00:45:14,240
support pollinators in these

1258
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:19,358
Landscapes and

1259
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:21,000
acknowledgements so again I'm I'm

1260
00:45:19,358 --> 00:45:22,719
visiting from Long Island University my

1261
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:24,119
appointment is primarily teaching there

1262
00:45:22,719 --> 00:45:25,639
so everything I presented here really

1263
00:45:24,119 --> 00:45:27,480
wouldn't be possible without working

1264
00:45:25,639 --> 00:45:29,719
with really wonderful collaborators

1265
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:31,920
allows me to stay active in the research

1266
00:45:29,719 --> 00:45:33,879
realm and so at Long Island University

1267
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:36,639
I've worked with uh several great

1268
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:38,640
students who I've sort of converted into

1269
00:45:36,639 --> 00:45:42,000
ecologists uh Penn State University

1270
00:45:38,639 --> 00:45:44,519
Shelby fler was my uh Mentor David

1271
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:47,440
Biddinger I work a lot with on this tree

1272
00:45:44,519 --> 00:45:49,800
fruit C collaborations and just his

1273
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:52,920
practical knowledge of those systems is

1274
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:55,160
is is really amazing uh Chris Mullen

1275
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:57,480
toxicologist at Penn State and neandra

1276
00:45:55,159 --> 00:45:58,960
josi was a postdoc

1277
00:45:57,480 --> 00:46:00,960
uh the reason I'm here is from working

1278
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:02,760
with Megan Gregory who I met in the

1279
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:05,159
gardens in Brooklyn who's also doing

1280
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:07,640
research there I obviously want to thank

1281
00:46:05,159 --> 00:46:09,759
all the Growers and Community gardeners

1282
00:46:07,639 --> 00:46:11,759
and then the taxonomists all this can't

1283
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:13,960
be done without them I really relied

1284
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:16,040
heavily on John Asher and then Bob

1285
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:19,400
Davidson and then this work was funded

1286
00:46:16,039 --> 00:46:21,558
by several different resources so I hope

1287
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:23,400
you found that interesting entomologist

1288
00:46:21,559 --> 00:46:25,440
in the horiculture department here but

1289
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:26,960
uh I can try to answer any questions if

1290
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:28,679
you have any also if there are any

1291
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:30,960
students that are soon to graduate and

1292
00:46:28,679 --> 00:46:33,078
considering different job opportunities

1293
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:34,440
sometimes when I've given past seminars

1294
00:46:33,079 --> 00:46:36,400
they like to talk about that working at

1295
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:39,519
a place like Liu or something like that

1296
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:39,519
so thank

1297
00:46:42,039 --> 00:46:47,519
you this has been a production of

1298
00:46:44,639 --> 00:46:50,519
Cornell University on the web at

1299
