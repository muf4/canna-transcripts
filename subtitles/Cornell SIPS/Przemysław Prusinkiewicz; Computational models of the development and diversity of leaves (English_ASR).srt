1
00:00:01,159 --> 00:00:04,799
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:09,119 --> 00:00:15,239
University

3
00:00:11,199 --> 00:00:17,960
so um as Adrian has mentioned my

4
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:21,518
original interest and motivation was in

5
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:25,160
the well modeling of plans for U sorry

6
00:00:21,518 --> 00:00:25,159
can we have this spotlights

7
00:00:26,199 --> 00:00:33,320
out yeah thank

8
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:37,960
you if the uh the point was to model uh

9
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:41,359
plants for U visual purposes so let's

10
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:41,359
say to create scen such as this

11
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:51,520
one no have it down yeah because there's

12
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:54,960
lots of of images which are quite dark

13
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:57,520
thank you and

14
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:01,399
um and the question was well how to

15
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:04,280
generate this kind of scenary

16
00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:07,159
easily so it turned out that the best

17
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:09,680
way is to actually try to simulate the

18
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:14,680
actual processes of plant

19
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:18,640
development and this is how I cross from

20
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:21,880
computer Graphics to developmental

21
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:24,359
biology and the big question is how

22
00:01:21,879 --> 00:01:25,679
patterns and forms emerge in the process

23
00:01:24,359 --> 00:01:28,799
of

24
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,000
development so this is actually pretty

25
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:31,159
much a fundamental question of

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,719
developmental

27
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:38,359
biology and if today I would like to

28
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:42,719
focus on a problem which we were trying

29
00:01:38,359 --> 00:01:47,239
to address most recently and this is how

30
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:50,039
uh the forms of um leaves

31
00:01:47,239 --> 00:01:52,399
emerge and this is a problem which is

32
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:56,240
particularly interesting because of the

33
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:58,439
huge diversity of Lea forms in

34
00:01:56,239 --> 00:02:03,000
nature

35
00:01:58,438 --> 00:02:07,399
moreover even so for us the difference

36
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:10,159
between compound and simple leaves is

37
00:02:07,399 --> 00:02:11,560
such a fundamental one it plays for

38
00:02:10,159 --> 00:02:13,359
example a huge role in the

39
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:15,360
classification of leaves to begin with

40
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:19,080
the question is is it a simple is it

41
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:24,360
compound it turns out that it is also a

42
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:27,439
very um labile feature of Lea form and

43
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:31,239
you can see that well often even within

44
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:33,519
a single H plant we may observe leaves

45
00:02:31,239 --> 00:02:38,280
of very different forms such as in this

46
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:41,000
case if in well in the flame tree so

47
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:45,479
those are leaves which are picked from

48
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:47,878
the same uh tree and kind of seem to be

49
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:50,919
located there without any Rhyme or

50
00:02:47,878 --> 00:02:52,799
Reason some are multilobed some are

51
00:02:50,919 --> 00:02:54,280
simple and in this case there is no

52
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:58,480
gradient to

53
00:02:54,280 --> 00:03:01,640
them this is another example in a silver

54
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:03,840
rward and over there well some early

55
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:08,679
leaves tend to be simple and then later

56
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:10,719
ones are well um well very well

57
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:13,760
dissected so

58
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:17,239
clearly a plant can produce this

59
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:19,519
diversity quite easily and the question

60
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:22,200
is well can we comprehend where the

61
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:23,840
diversity come

62
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:27,759
from

63
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:31,239
so although this would be a much more

64
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:33,120
kind of well nicer plan to work with if

65
00:03:31,239 --> 00:03:34,959
you want to understand with the

66
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,840
progression from simple to compound

67
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:40,920
leaves but well I don't think that ER is

68
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:43,920
known about genetics of silver RW so we

69
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:47,079
started from well a plant about which

70
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:50,559
well something is known namely

71
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:52,480
arabidopsis and well so arabidopsis is

72
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,438
not at all the best plant for this

73
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:55,438
because well these are simple but they

74
00:03:54,438 --> 00:03:57,799
have some

75
00:03:55,438 --> 00:04:01,759
serrations so the question is well can

76
00:03:57,799 --> 00:04:06,959
we understand where this ations come

77
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:09,280
from so if well I puted up with milto

78
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,759
santis then D for now at Max plant

79
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:15,199
Institute in

80
00:04:10,759 --> 00:04:20,560
Cologne in trying to figure out what is

81
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:22,879
the mechanism of um patterning of the

82
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:26,160
serration

83
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:28,120
and several things came to picture

84
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,280
probably the most important is that the

85
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:33,680
serration correspond

86
00:04:30,279 --> 00:04:36,559
with convergence points of pin polarity

87
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:40,800
so you can see here margin of the leaf

88
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:43,720
and pin proteines which are pumping oxin

89
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:46,759
are polarized in such a way that they

90
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:50,320
converge in the place which coincides

91
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:52,960
with the location of a convergence point

92
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:54,879
and by the way you are going to see on

93
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:59,478
all the slides or many slides either

94
00:04:54,879 --> 00:05:02,639
letter o or p o is observation and P is

95
00:04:59,478 --> 00:05:05,199
what we postulate on the basis of U

96
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:06,519
observations as the basis of model

97
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:09,280
construction which is supposed to

98
00:05:06,519 --> 00:05:13,560
elucidate what's going

99
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:17,198
on so this is one observation serations

100
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:20,839
are coinciding with these convergence

101
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:22,879
points and the transport of oxen is very

102
00:05:20,839 --> 00:05:26,000
important because if it is impaired by

103
00:05:22,879 --> 00:05:29,719
NPA we have this kind of leave margin

104
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:32,918
without serrations and then also uh we

105
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:36,199
lose this formation of convergence

106
00:05:32,918 --> 00:05:40,120
points so it appeared that the key to

107
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:42,400
the understanding of serration formation

108
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:47,720
is the understanding of the action of

109
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:47,719
oxen and how oxin driven patterning

110
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:55,400
happens so this is the question how and

111
00:05:51,439 --> 00:05:58,759
where do the convergence Point

112
00:05:55,399 --> 00:06:01,279
emerge so we created a model in which

113
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:05,280
which I'm going to show you VI and in

114
00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:07,959
this model A cell is represented as a

115
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:09,638
square oxygen concentration as with

116
00:06:07,959 --> 00:06:14,439
green square

117
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:18,319
inside fluxes of oxen are represented as

118
00:06:14,439 --> 00:06:21,560
well White Lines or arrows to show

119
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:22,240
direction The Wider the line the bigger

120
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:26,079
the

121
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:29,759
flux and pin concentrations are shown as

122
00:06:26,079 --> 00:06:31,879
bars shown in red The Wider the bar the

123
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:31,879
the

124
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:41,439
concentration so in

125
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:44,520
2006 my student alvare Smith and also um

126
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:46,439
Henry Johnson who was then a postdoc

127
00:06:44,519 --> 00:06:48,639
working at University of California

128
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:54,439
Irvine and collaboration with

129
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:56,280
Caltech um came up with the same idea of

130
00:06:54,439 --> 00:07:00,319
polarization which

131
00:06:56,279 --> 00:07:03,638
is pins which are Transporters of oxen

132
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:05,280
are well as observed are localized in a

133
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:08,280
polar way to some

134
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:12,198
membranes so this kind of part of

135
00:07:08,279 --> 00:07:14,439
interaction between oxen and pins was

136
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:17,919
basically by then quite well documented

137
00:07:14,439 --> 00:07:20,199
but they postulated that pins are

138
00:07:17,918 --> 00:07:22,079
orienting themselves towards neighboring

139
00:07:20,199 --> 00:07:25,879
cell with the highest concentration of

140
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:28,519
oxin so the more oxin we have the more

141
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:31,280
pins are we going to have here so the

142
00:07:28,519 --> 00:07:34,758
question is first can this kind of

143
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:34,758
feedback create a

144
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:40,680
pattern so here's a simulation which is

145
00:07:37,918 --> 00:07:40,680
illustrating this

146
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:47,478
process we have a chain of H

147
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:55,199
cells and you can see this interaction

148
00:07:51,319 --> 00:07:56,800
in if well this feedback in action and

149
00:07:55,199 --> 00:08:02,240
it results in the formation of

150
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:02,240
convergence point and where oxen

151
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:10,759
maximum and if this happens on a longer

152
00:08:07,079 --> 00:08:12,758
distance then we obtain a pattern of

153
00:08:10,759 --> 00:08:15,759
approximately equally

154
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:18,598
spaced convergence

155
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:21,919
points so

156
00:08:18,598 --> 00:08:24,719
this provides a mechanism for creating a

157
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:28,478
number of convergence points in the

158
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:31,720
margin of the leaf but before I um

159
00:08:28,478 --> 00:08:34,918
proceed there I wanted to if dwell a

160
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:37,918
little bit on this model of

161
00:08:34,918 --> 00:08:37,918
polarization

162
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:47,959
so so the model of polarization which

163
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:52,278
which was proposed by Smith and Johnson

164
00:08:47,958 --> 00:08:54,958
Json if was in a sense nonphysical it

165
00:08:52,278 --> 00:08:57,439
was because it was assuming that a cell

166
00:08:54,958 --> 00:08:59,719
knows what is the concentration of oxen

167
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:01,720
in neighboring cells

168
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:03,959
and well this violate the principle of

169
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:07,600
locality it was kind of like well

170
00:09:03,958 --> 00:09:09,439
guessing what another cell has inside

171
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:12,680
without providing a mechanism how it can

172
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:16,560
be done so this was an open question how

173
00:09:12,679 --> 00:09:21,120
actually it may happen and um well

174
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:24,559
recently my poog mck cheslak well um and

175
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:26,679
and another perod student Adam Rion will

176
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:31,359
came up with the idea which is um

177
00:09:26,679 --> 00:09:33,958
Illustrated here so if this is actually

178
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:36,120
not invalidating this mechanism of

179
00:09:33,958 --> 00:09:38,078
polarizing towards the cell with highest

180
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:40,560
oxygen concentration but it provides a

181
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:46,359
possible mechanical possible

182
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:49,759
mechanical explanation so the idea is if

183
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:52,240
that to separate e flux and influx and

184
00:09:49,759 --> 00:09:54,639
they already separated because they are

185
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:57,720
separate e Fluxx carriers inflex

186
00:09:54,639 --> 00:10:01,639
carriers in the cell so moving one more

187
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:04,079
step we assume that the cell can measure

188
00:10:01,639 --> 00:10:06,958
e flux and influx

189
00:10:04,078 --> 00:10:10,039
separately um and it is actually

190
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:13,039
possible to come up with well actually

191
00:10:10,039 --> 00:10:16,519
too many plausible bi biochemical

192
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:19,078
mechanisms for measuring unidirectional

193
00:10:16,519 --> 00:10:22,278
fluxes so now it turns

194
00:10:19,078 --> 00:10:24,838
out that if you assume well on one hand

195
00:10:22,278 --> 00:10:29,480
we assume that there is a presence of

196
00:10:24,839 --> 00:10:33,079
oxin e flux promoting pins this is par

197
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:38,039
of all theories of um Ox polarization

198
00:10:33,078 --> 00:10:40,958
going back to success canalization

199
00:10:38,039 --> 00:10:43,838
theory if we assume that the influx has

200
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:46,799
opposite effect then we have pure

201
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:50,399
canalization in the style of sax which

202
00:10:46,799 --> 00:10:53,519
results in coordinated

203
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:56,240
polarization of all PS in one way so

204
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:58,799
this is good for creating long

205
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:00,879
coordinated files of cells like in the

206
00:10:58,799 --> 00:11:05,278
case of when

207
00:11:00,879 --> 00:11:09,480
if however we change the sign and influx

208
00:11:05,278 --> 00:11:11,039
also polarizes pins here so whether

209
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:13,240
oxygen flows this way or whether it

210
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:16,039
flows that way it both has the same

211
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:19,039
effect of um promoting polarization of

212
00:11:16,039 --> 00:11:20,360
oxid here then we are getting

213
00:11:19,039 --> 00:11:22,958
convergence

214
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:25,278
points so this provides a plausible

215
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:26,638
mechanism in which a cell does not have

216
00:11:25,278 --> 00:11:29,799
to look

217
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:33,240
into what happens in a different cell

218
00:11:29,799 --> 00:11:35,639
it just checks what are unid directional

219
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:40,680
fluxes out and in and make decision out

220
00:11:35,639 --> 00:11:43,039
of this uh moreover well um it can be

221
00:11:40,679 --> 00:11:46,078
shown that this change of sign here can

222
00:11:43,039 --> 00:11:49,159
be accomplished in a quite simple

223
00:11:46,078 --> 00:11:51,599
biochemical Network by changing rate of

224
00:11:49,159 --> 00:11:54,799
a single reaction which exp which would

225
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:58,079
explain why so often we see changes of

226
00:11:54,799 --> 00:12:01,838
polarization from one to another

227
00:11:58,078 --> 00:12:03,879
type okay okay so one way or another we

228
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:06,200
have a mechanism for forming convergence

229
00:12:03,879 --> 00:12:10,320
points and now the question is how these

230
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:14,199
convergence points are if emerging in

231
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:16,560
the growing margin of the leaf and here

232
00:12:14,198 --> 00:12:20,078
if well the postulate goes actually to

233
00:12:16,559 --> 00:12:23,039
19th century where when

234
00:12:20,078 --> 00:12:26,239
Hofmeister proposed well looking mainly

235
00:12:23,039 --> 00:12:28,838
at filot taxis but this is more General

236
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:30,560
principle at patterning processes and

237
00:12:28,839 --> 00:12:32,880
form ated what is known as the first

238
00:12:30,559 --> 00:12:35,599
available space Theory According to

239
00:12:32,879 --> 00:12:38,320
which new organs are

240
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:41,440
created wherever is enough space for

241
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:43,040
them so if we apply this to margin we

242
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:46,279
have the following situation we have a

243
00:12:43,039 --> 00:12:48,559
leaf small one kind of leaf primordium

244
00:12:46,278 --> 00:12:50,159
in which we have a convergence point

245
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:52,799
this convergence Point actually is the

246
00:12:50,159 --> 00:12:54,799
one which patterned this the position of

247
00:12:52,799 --> 00:12:56,479
this Leaf at the first place as a part

248
00:12:54,799 --> 00:12:59,599
of filot

249
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:03,560
taxis now this leave grows and then it

250
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:06,399
grows the margin expands creating space

251
00:13:03,559 --> 00:13:08,439
for new convergence

252
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:12,759
points

253
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:14,160
and this process continues so as margin

254
00:13:12,759 --> 00:13:15,039
goes more and more convergence points

255
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:18,799
are

256
00:13:15,039 --> 00:13:21,480
formed and if you assume according to

257
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:23,559
the observation that convergence points

258
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:27,480
correspond to the places where the leaf

259
00:13:23,559 --> 00:13:30,838
grows faster outwards then we have well

260
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:33,039
a plausible mechanism of of um formation

261
00:13:30,839 --> 00:13:35,360
of serration now the question is would

262
00:13:33,039 --> 00:13:36,439
this work if it put all these components

263
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:39,079
into the

264
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:42,040
model so we created the model which is

265
00:13:39,078 --> 00:13:44,078
shown here so this is kind of like in

266
00:13:42,039 --> 00:13:49,159
the case of arabidopsis leaf more or

267
00:13:44,078 --> 00:13:51,439
less um so again the basic idea is that

268
00:13:49,159 --> 00:13:52,480
that we have a patterning process going

269
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,959
on on the

270
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:58,560
margin and each time where convergence

271
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:59,838
point is formed grows outwards is

272
00:13:58,559 --> 00:14:01,559
acceleration

273
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:04,800
and is more accelerated when conc is

274
00:14:01,559 --> 00:14:06,958
higher less when it is lower and pattern

275
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:08,799
is supposed to emerge so will a pattern

276
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:11,039
or what is the shape of a leaf emerg

277
00:14:08,799 --> 00:14:11,039
from

278
00:14:13,879 --> 00:14:20,799
this so here is this process kind of

279
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:24,078
with parameters more or less taken at

280
00:14:20,799 --> 00:14:26,399
random you can see that patterning takes

281
00:14:24,078 --> 00:14:28,838
place and so does grows you have

282
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:31,799
something like well let's let's call it

283
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:31,800
a generic L

284
00:14:31,879 --> 00:14:37,198
Leaf okay let's check let's change

285
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,199
parameters a little

286
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:53,879
bit we are getting a different pattern

287
00:14:51,078 --> 00:14:56,879
now does it correspond to a real leaf or

288
00:14:53,879 --> 00:14:56,879
not

289
00:14:57,799 --> 00:15:03,159
well it it actually happens to

290
00:14:59,919 --> 00:15:05,198
correspond quite closely to I believe

291
00:15:03,159 --> 00:15:09,198
and it is amazing although again we

292
00:15:05,198 --> 00:15:11,479
don't have um molecular level data about

293
00:15:09,198 --> 00:15:14,078
this how close this correspondence is

294
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:19,879
kind of L to L this one here this one

295
00:15:14,078 --> 00:15:22,519
there this one here here here here here

296
00:15:19,879 --> 00:15:27,039
there

297
00:15:22,519 --> 00:15:29,600
okay so given that we don't have this um

298
00:15:27,039 --> 00:15:31,599
detailed data of iy well can we

299
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:36,240
make an arabidopsis

300
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:39,839
Le so here I will show you this this um

301
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:41,680
animation which at first may look like

302
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:44,399
well we succeeded but I would like you

303
00:15:41,679 --> 00:15:46,958
to to pay attention to a phenomenon

304
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:49,120
which actually is drawback of the model

305
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:50,758
which I'm discussing just now then you

306
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:52,679
are going to see that some convergence

307
00:15:50,759 --> 00:15:54,560
points are shifting as the LI grows they

308
00:15:52,679 --> 00:15:57,919
jump from one position to another so

309
00:15:54,559 --> 00:15:57,919
let's see it

310
00:16:01,078 --> 00:16:05,039
okay so let's look let's say at this

311
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:05,040
area

312
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:13,120
here oh it disappeared okay and here's

313
00:16:09,799 --> 00:16:16,879
the similar situation

314
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:18,120
occurs so convergence points are formed

315
00:16:16,879 --> 00:16:21,639
but they are not

316
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:21,639
stable as the things

317
00:16:24,278 --> 00:16:29,399
grow now this kind of jumping of

318
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:31,078
convergence points have have not really

319
00:16:29,399 --> 00:16:33,480
be observed in arabidopsis and the

320
00:16:31,078 --> 00:16:37,758
question is so what is the mechanism

321
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:41,120
which stabilizes things there

322
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:41,120
sorry here we

323
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:47,519
go so in order to see what is the source

324
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:51,480
of this jumping we should we should re

325
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:54,278
examine the first available space Theory

326
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:57,120
again because there is an element there

327
00:16:54,278 --> 00:17:00,679
which is actually was sort of

328
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:02,600
imprecise so here what gos suppose that

329
00:17:00,679 --> 00:17:05,678
we have two existing

330
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:06,959
organs and grow takes place creating

331
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:10,600
more

332
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:13,240
space well final space is sufficient to

333
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:15,119
introduce another organ and one would

334
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:17,880
say and we can iterate this process

335
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:21,198
forever so again space

336
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:23,799
grows and we iterate it the point is

337
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:27,720
that is not the only possibility this is

338
00:17:23,798 --> 00:17:31,400
another possibility that an existing if

339
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:33,640
well kind of prototype of the organ is

340
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:38,000
going to be shifted creating space for

341
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:39,600
another one so here Al nether nor the on

342
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,079
the left nor on the right side we have

343
00:17:39,599 --> 00:17:43,918
enough space but if we can reorganize

344
00:17:42,079 --> 00:17:47,119
things we create enough

345
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:49,320
space so this kind of possibility exists

346
00:17:47,119 --> 00:17:52,038
but apparently is prevented in

347
00:17:49,319 --> 00:17:54,720
arabidopsis and the question is

348
00:17:52,038 --> 00:17:58,359
how so here molecular data come into

349
00:17:54,720 --> 00:18:00,159
play again and it turns out that

350
00:17:58,359 --> 00:18:05,359
conversion point is

351
00:18:00,159 --> 00:18:11,120
flanked by areas in which um another

352
00:18:05,359 --> 00:18:16,798
protein Capt cotons or cak is being

353
00:18:11,119 --> 00:18:19,759
expressed and it if on one hand is is

354
00:18:16,798 --> 00:18:23,400
present on one hand on another hand if

355
00:18:19,759 --> 00:18:26,200
it is absent so in mutant entire pic

356
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:26,200
process is

357
00:18:26,519 --> 00:18:32,200
destroyed so

358
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:34,720
based on this we amended the model which

359
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:38,840
I showed you this up theadi

360
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:44,640
model with two assumptions

361
00:18:38,839 --> 00:18:49,639
regarding cak one is that cak is

362
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:52,400
absent where uh in convergence points so

363
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:54,120
um we we implemented it this by assuming

364
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:58,000
that high concentration of oxen

365
00:18:54,119 --> 00:19:01,079
suppresses cak and the second thing is

366
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:03,279
that cak is needed for pin reorientation

367
00:19:01,079 --> 00:19:03,279
to

368
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:07,798
occur so

369
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:16,079
then our simulation becomes like

370
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:17,798
this we start in a situation where kak

371
00:19:16,079 --> 00:19:23,399
is present everywhere so kak is

372
00:19:17,798 --> 00:19:23,400
represented as this um yellow

373
00:19:25,319 --> 00:19:32,038
circles and then as the locations

374
00:19:29,119 --> 00:19:34,918
where uh convergence points

375
00:19:32,038 --> 00:19:36,759
appear oxygen concentration increases

376
00:19:34,919 --> 00:19:39,000
but this increase of concentration of

377
00:19:36,759 --> 00:19:42,359
oxin eliminates cak from the

378
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:45,119
air and if you assume that presence of

379
00:19:42,359 --> 00:19:48,119
cak is needed for repolarization to

380
00:19:45,119 --> 00:19:50,759
occur this convergence point now is

381
00:19:48,119 --> 00:19:52,879
fixed because there's no cak there so

382
00:19:50,759 --> 00:19:56,640
repolarization cannot occur

383
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:59,520
anymore so we have a pattern which looks

384
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:02,640
at first side similar but

385
00:19:59,519 --> 00:20:04,918
cak is present where oxin is absent and

386
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:06,120
cak is absent where oxin is present in

387
00:20:04,919 --> 00:20:09,000
high

388
00:20:06,119 --> 00:20:15,599
concentration and this absence of cak

389
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:15,599
here fixes location of of

390
00:20:20,679 --> 00:20:27,679
primia there is one more element to the

391
00:20:23,839 --> 00:20:29,399
story namely that um it is known that

392
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:31,000
cak ere expression

393
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:34,519
makes indentation

394
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:38,000
deeper so we assumed that cak has

395
00:20:34,519 --> 00:20:41,960
additional effect of suppressing growth

396
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:45,000
so we no longer have a simple situation

397
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:48,279
where the presence of well oxin Maxima

398
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:50,159
promotes growth we have also a kind of

399
00:20:48,279 --> 00:20:54,399
well other side of the story that

400
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:54,400
presence of cak is creating

401
00:20:54,919 --> 00:21:00,038
indentations and if you put this into

402
00:20:56,839 --> 00:21:00,038
the model

403
00:21:01,279 --> 00:21:05,558
now we have a situation here cak is

404
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:08,359
shown as as pink dots because yellow

405
00:21:05,558 --> 00:21:11,319
doesn't look well enough of such size

406
00:21:08,359 --> 00:21:15,798
thing you can see that pattern occurs of

407
00:21:11,319 --> 00:21:18,158
indentations and serration but now there

408
00:21:15,798 --> 00:21:21,839
is no jumping of

409
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:21,840
er of convergence

410
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:32,159
points so okay so the ability of

411
00:21:28,679 --> 00:21:35,840
reproducing Y type was part of the story

412
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:38,640
but if there are also um other um

413
00:21:35,839 --> 00:21:41,639
elements of validation of the model so

414
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:42,960
well if you create pin mutant well it

415
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:45,640
doesn't have serration because

416
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:50,759
convergence points cannot be formed if

417
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:54,120
we flood the model with oxen we have the

418
00:21:50,759 --> 00:21:56,960
same situation as in reality that is

419
00:21:54,119 --> 00:21:59,439
that again there are no serration formed

420
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:02,558
because flooding of uh

421
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:06,240
Le with oxen suppresses cak and

422
00:22:02,558 --> 00:22:06,240
consequently pins cannot

423
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:13,200
reorganize um if we have cak well the

424
00:22:11,079 --> 00:22:16,439
same story the absence of cak pins

425
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:19,200
cannot reorganize if we overexpress then

426
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:19,200
you have deerc

427
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:29,038
serations so this is kind of first step

428
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:33,720
in the modeling of um if in in the

429
00:22:29,038 --> 00:22:36,000
modeling of leaf shape well we had grand

430
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:38,759
plan at the beginning from simple leaves

431
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,599
to compound well so far we have tiny

432
00:22:38,759 --> 00:22:43,400
step in the direction we have

433
00:22:40,599 --> 00:22:46,278
serration so can we understand well

434
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:47,120
situation where some Lopes or compound

435
00:22:46,278 --> 00:22:49,919
this

436
00:22:47,119 --> 00:22:52,959
occurs and for this again working with

437
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:56,400
MOS stantis and with my student Adam

438
00:22:52,960 --> 00:23:00,440
ranion if we turned our attention to a

439
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:00,440
relative to arabidopsis which is kardam

440
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:08,759
P so even though it is a close relative

441
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:12,798
it is it has very different leaves so

442
00:23:08,759 --> 00:23:15,558
this arabidopsis this is Camin huta and

443
00:23:12,798 --> 00:23:17,918
the question is well where the

444
00:23:15,558 --> 00:23:21,240
difference which to our eye is a marked

445
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:21,240
difference between these leaves comes

446
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:27,159
from

447
00:23:23,079 --> 00:23:31,038
and well one element of the puzzle is

448
00:23:27,159 --> 00:23:33,559
that it is related to the uh well group

449
00:23:31,038 --> 00:23:38,200
of uh genes in nox

450
00:23:33,558 --> 00:23:42,558
family of which BP which I don't dare to

451
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:46,159
pronounce because it has long name if is

452
00:23:42,558 --> 00:23:49,599
representative so we see that an

453
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:50,919
arabidopsis in which nox gen are not

454
00:23:49,599 --> 00:23:54,199
expressed in the

455
00:23:50,919 --> 00:23:58,720
leaves well we have this kind of shape

456
00:23:54,200 --> 00:24:01,798
if we ectopically express Express BP

457
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:06,278
then we are getting almost a compound

458
00:24:01,798 --> 00:24:11,359
leaf and then in kardam huta where BP is

459
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:13,119
present where nox gen are present we are

460
00:24:11,359 --> 00:24:15,759
in the leaves we are getting well

461
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:18,798
perfectly compound

462
00:24:15,759 --> 00:24:24,079
leaf here is kind of molecular side of

463
00:24:18,798 --> 00:24:27,519
the story or first microscopic so um in

464
00:24:24,079 --> 00:24:29,879
kardam new leaflets are formed at the

465
00:24:27,519 --> 00:24:32,599
basal part of of the

466
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:35,679
leaf so in arabidopsis there's no

467
00:24:32,599 --> 00:24:39,119
outgrowth and here there is

468
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:44,559
outgrowth and if we uh show where

469
00:24:39,119 --> 00:24:46,678
another noxe STM is expressed in kardam

470
00:24:44,558 --> 00:24:49,359
we can clearly see that it is present in

471
00:24:46,679 --> 00:24:53,798
this basal part of the

472
00:24:49,359 --> 00:24:57,240
leaf so um this is one part of the story

473
00:24:53,798 --> 00:25:02,278
regarding difference between um

474
00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:05,319
cardamine and and if arabidopsis leaves

475
00:25:02,278 --> 00:25:10,159
another element which is important is to

476
00:25:05,319 --> 00:25:14,639
look at veins so if we look into kadam

477
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:16,480
Leaf we can clearly see that

478
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:20,120
leaflets

479
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:22,360
are growing in directions of veins so

480
00:25:20,119 --> 00:25:24,398
this is something which was absent in

481
00:25:22,359 --> 00:25:26,240
the model of kardam of arabidopsis which

482
00:25:24,398 --> 00:25:28,079
has assumed well there's some growth OBS

483
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:30,359
serations there accelerated growth but

484
00:25:28,079 --> 00:25:32,199
because the serations are small in which

485
00:25:30,359 --> 00:25:34,479
direction they grow was not an issue but

486
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:37,080
if you have an entire l or entire

487
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:40,200
leaflet then in which direction it grows

488
00:25:37,079 --> 00:25:42,960
becomes an issue so taking these two

489
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:44,319
facts together we created the following

490
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:48,880
kind of

491
00:25:44,319 --> 00:25:53,240
hypothesis first that veins present here

492
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:54,919
visible here veins Define growth axis so

493
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:57,798
it is a postate because what we can

494
00:25:54,919 --> 00:25:59,799
observe is only that if grow axis are

495
00:25:57,798 --> 00:26:01,599
correlated with veins here we assume

496
00:25:59,798 --> 00:26:05,079
that the mechanism which patterns veins

497
00:26:01,599 --> 00:26:08,000
is defining direction of growth and the

498
00:26:05,079 --> 00:26:11,319
second thing is that no potentiates cak

499
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:14,240
so basically what no is what nox is

500
00:26:11,319 --> 00:26:17,278
doing is if well

501
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:20,000
first it amplifies the action of cak in

502
00:26:17,278 --> 00:26:22,200
particular it amplifies this suppression

503
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,200
of

504
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:29,278
growth so the the reason why he SS occur

505
00:26:27,319 --> 00:26:30,918
would be due to the fact that well

506
00:26:29,278 --> 00:26:34,240
normal LEF maybe would like with like

507
00:26:30,919 --> 00:26:38,320
this but KAG is expressed potentiated by

508
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:42,159
nox makes this big indentation and also

509
00:26:38,319 --> 00:26:46,079
nox is needed for for for the formation

510
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:46,080
of new organs to uh to take

511
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:52,240
place so based on this we created a

512
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:56,159
model which works as

513
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:58,599
follows um so here's Le primordium near

514
00:26:56,159 --> 00:27:04,600
the base we have expression of no box

515
00:26:58,599 --> 00:27:07,639
shown in yellow and um and and the

516
00:27:04,599 --> 00:27:09,719
tip convergence point is marked by the

517
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:13,240
convergence point of pin and presence of

518
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:13,240
axin K

519
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:21,640
noock oxin promotes leaflet growth so it

520
00:27:18,079 --> 00:27:25,678
becomes bigger cak constraints

521
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:28,320
growth and also while um working

522
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:31,360
together with no they create this narrow

523
00:27:28,319 --> 00:27:31,359
form at the

524
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:37,600
base however at some point new

525
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:37,599
convergence Point

526
00:27:37,839 --> 00:27:44,839
emerges and then growth starts there

527
00:27:41,798 --> 00:27:47,398
here farther growth further formation of

528
00:27:44,839 --> 00:27:51,319
lateral LIF cannot uh happen because we

529
00:27:47,398 --> 00:27:54,639
don't have here um no or cak

530
00:27:51,319 --> 00:27:57,558
here this dominance of no and c has been

531
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:59,320
broken so growth occurs and the growth

532
00:27:57,558 --> 00:28:02,319
is going to be in the

533
00:27:59,319 --> 00:28:05,278
direction of um veins which we assume

534
00:28:02,319 --> 00:28:07,960
are perpendicular to the original

535
00:28:05,278 --> 00:28:11,798
Direction so let's see how it works in

536
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:11,798
an animation of

537
00:28:12,079 --> 00:28:18,278
simulation so main growth direction is

538
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:20,600
established by this

539
00:28:18,278 --> 00:28:23,960
axis and here at some

540
00:28:20,599 --> 00:28:25,879
point um new convergence points occurred

541
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:30,120
and they grow in perpendicular

542
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:30,120
Direction and this process it

543
00:28:30,398 --> 00:28:39,719
itates so we are going to see subsequent

544
00:28:35,079 --> 00:28:42,720
um leaflets being formed in the basical

545
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:42,720
progression

546
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:04,919
okay so this is comparison with well a

547
00:29:02,278 --> 00:29:07,278
young leaf of

548
00:29:04,919 --> 00:29:09,720
kardam and we can see that well this

549
00:29:07,278 --> 00:29:12,480
progression of leaflets near the base

550
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:16,319
was more or less captured by the model

551
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:19,599
however the shape of the terminal Leaf

552
00:29:16,319 --> 00:29:22,359
was not really captured and the reason

553
00:29:19,599 --> 00:29:24,519
for this is that when modeling the

554
00:29:22,359 --> 00:29:28,199
terminal Leaf we did not really

555
00:29:24,519 --> 00:29:31,919
incorporate vasculature there so now the

556
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:35,440
question is well can we

557
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:39,038
increase the very similitude very

558
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:41,038
similitude of leaves by looking at veins

559
00:29:39,038 --> 00:29:43,519
more

560
00:29:41,038 --> 00:29:47,278
closely and in order to do this we

561
00:29:43,519 --> 00:29:48,919
developed model which actually operates

562
00:29:47,278 --> 00:29:51,880
at a slightly

563
00:29:48,919 --> 00:29:54,519
higher level of abstraction so we no

564
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:58,200
longer model explicitly interaction of

565
00:29:54,519 --> 00:30:01,480
oxin with pins we are just using the

566
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:04,519
fact that um as a result of this

567
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:07,399
interaction new uh convergence points

568
00:30:04,519 --> 00:30:10,480
can be formed at some distance so in a

569
00:30:07,398 --> 00:30:12,959
sense interaction between pin and and

570
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:14,000
oxen is a way of measuring distances

571
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:17,600
along the

572
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:20,599
margin and this process is modulated by

573
00:30:17,599 --> 00:30:23,839
the presence or absence of substances

574
00:30:20,599 --> 00:30:27,000
such as cak and no which can which can

575
00:30:23,839 --> 00:30:30,119
say that well even so distances are

576
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:33,798
relatively large but because of say

577
00:30:30,119 --> 00:30:36,000
absence of cak or nox a new convergence

578
00:30:33,798 --> 00:30:38,200
points cannot appear

579
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:42,119
there so if we look at things from this

580
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:43,880
perspective we have the following basic

581
00:30:42,119 --> 00:30:47,319
model

582
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:50,960
so um things are happening on the margin

583
00:30:47,319 --> 00:30:53,798
and within the lamina so gross centers

584
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:55,919
are formed by this distance measuring

585
00:30:53,798 --> 00:31:00,079
process as the

586
00:30:55,919 --> 00:31:01,759
margin um between growth centers so

587
00:31:00,079 --> 00:31:05,158
between let's say here and

588
00:31:01,759 --> 00:31:08,519
here growth suppression can occur which

589
00:31:05,159 --> 00:31:12,639
is a region where at some distance from

590
00:31:08,519 --> 00:31:12,638
convergence points where cak is

591
00:31:13,159 --> 00:31:17,360
expressed creation of a convergence

592
00:31:15,319 --> 00:31:18,960
point is associated with the formation

593
00:31:17,359 --> 00:31:22,798
of

594
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:25,798
vein the first um Mid Vin goes to the

595
00:31:22,798 --> 00:31:29,398
base subsequent mid vein subsequent

596
00:31:25,798 --> 00:31:33,720
veins connect to the previously formed

597
00:31:29,398 --> 00:31:37,119
vein and veins defined grow Direction so

598
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:40,200
for example here grow is going to be

599
00:31:37,119 --> 00:31:42,479
upwards but here is going to be well

600
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:47,278
combination of this upwards coming from

601
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:47,278
this vein and lateral coming from

602
00:31:47,599 --> 00:31:53,359
that and there is no which is kind of

603
00:31:51,038 --> 00:31:55,278
amplifying the action of cxs and can be

604
00:31:53,359 --> 00:31:58,519
expressed let's say in slightly

605
00:31:55,278 --> 00:31:58,519
different regions

606
00:31:59,839 --> 00:32:06,240
So within this model the key element of

607
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:09,840
uh gross suppression is the

608
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:11,599
substance red corresponding to cak so

609
00:32:09,839 --> 00:32:14,879
that as leave margin

610
00:32:11,599 --> 00:32:18,199
expands this cak region is broken and

611
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:18,200
here new convergence point is

612
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:23,600
formed so if we create this kind of

613
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:25,440
model and put these elements together

614
00:32:23,599 --> 00:32:27,359
just the element which I

615
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:28,360
described convergence point on the

616
00:32:27,359 --> 00:32:31,038
margin

617
00:32:28,359 --> 00:32:34,000
veins uh connecting convergence points

618
00:32:31,038 --> 00:32:38,158
to into Network and it's defining the

619
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:40,638
direction of growth and uh growth rates

620
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:42,480
and and possibility of creating

621
00:32:40,638 --> 00:32:45,199
convergence points modulated by C and

622
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:46,839
noock we can get for example this kind

623
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:49,600
of growth

624
00:32:46,839 --> 00:32:52,038
progression so

625
00:32:49,599 --> 00:32:55,558
here

626
00:32:52,038 --> 00:32:55,558
is a sample

627
00:32:55,638 --> 00:33:00,558
simulation so now I have kept the the

628
00:32:58,679 --> 00:33:03,038
leaf kind of of a constant size on the

629
00:33:00,558 --> 00:33:05,079
screen so it's it's going to CH chape

630
00:33:03,038 --> 00:33:07,278
size because if I made the really grow

631
00:33:05,079 --> 00:33:09,759
the first stages would be very small so

632
00:33:07,278 --> 00:33:12,480
things can be can be scaled so all

633
00:33:09,759 --> 00:33:16,079
leaves as the leaf as it grows is always

634
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:16,079
scaled to the same size on the

635
00:33:24,759 --> 00:33:30,919
screen okay and we are getting

636
00:33:28,839 --> 00:33:33,398
quite a plausible Leaf of which which is

637
00:33:30,919 --> 00:33:34,840
found simple leaf which well we could

638
00:33:33,398 --> 00:33:37,000
try to say whether it is leaf of a

639
00:33:34,839 --> 00:33:39,959
cherry or something like this but well

640
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,960
reasonable generic

641
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:49,720
Leaf by changing parameters of the model

642
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:52,200
we can easily change the form of this

643
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:55,360
Leaf so just by changing one thing which

644
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:59,240
is branching angle we can make it

645
00:33:55,359 --> 00:33:59,240
looking like a g leaf

646
00:34:00,759 --> 00:34:08,559
and here is well um maybe more

647
00:34:03,839 --> 00:34:13,078
interesting fact that if we increase

648
00:34:08,559 --> 00:34:18,719
the um let's say strength or impact of

649
00:34:13,079 --> 00:34:20,359
cak if so that it creates de deeper

650
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:22,239
um

651
00:34:20,358 --> 00:34:26,960
indentations then we have progression

652
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:28,239
from a simple to a well dissected form

653
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:31,480
or kind of

654
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:35,000
High LED and moreover you can see that

655
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:37,320
there is a difference in the underlying

656
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:41,079
architecture so what we have here for

657
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:45,240
example is um there are

658
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:47,800
no here the lateral veins to the left

659
00:34:45,239 --> 00:34:49,479
but not to the right but here it

660
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:51,720
appeared to the right and here we have

661
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:54,639
to the right as well and it is so

662
00:34:51,719 --> 00:34:56,078
because as this indentation was created

663
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:58,680
which was absent

664
00:34:56,079 --> 00:35:01,720
here additional space has been created

665
00:34:58,679 --> 00:35:05,679
between convergence Point as measured

666
00:35:01,719 --> 00:35:07,799
along the margin and this provided well

667
00:35:05,679 --> 00:35:10,039
room for well additional convergence

668
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:13,200
points and additional veins which

669
00:35:10,039 --> 00:35:13,199
support the

670
00:35:14,039 --> 00:35:22,039
system here are some examples in which

671
00:35:17,719 --> 00:35:25,279
we have a interaction between um cak

672
00:35:22,039 --> 00:35:28,119
shown in red and nox shown in blue which

673
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:29,519
creates deeper veins and I have example

674
00:35:28,119 --> 00:35:34,000
which I would like to manipulate but I

675
00:35:29,519 --> 00:35:34,000
need different glasses for this so sorry

676
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:03,119
okay so what I would like to show you

677
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:06,159
now is that by changing some quite

678
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:08,720
intuitive parameters we can obtain large

679
00:36:06,159 --> 00:36:08,719
variation of

680
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:14,000
shapes so this is basic

681
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:31,838
simulation this kind of

682
00:36:28,559 --> 00:36:31,838
highly loped

683
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:36,400
Leaf as shown in

684
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:48,160
here now let us suppose that the cck

685
00:36:44,358 --> 00:36:51,400
that the impact of cak on if indentation

686
00:36:48,159 --> 00:36:51,399
is decreased

687
00:37:08,679 --> 00:37:16,279
so we are getting a leaf which has

688
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:18,599
simply still this basic form of having

689
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:18,599
three

690
00:37:19,318 --> 00:37:24,599
Lopes but it is much more smooth because

691
00:37:22,199 --> 00:37:27,838
well red color is not creating such a

692
00:37:24,599 --> 00:37:27,838
deep indentations

693
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:39,640
now let's assume that the impact of blue

694
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:39,640
morphogen so nox is decreased as

695
00:37:46,358 --> 00:37:53,519
well okay and lops maintain competence

696
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:53,519
of creating new veins

697
00:38:03,039 --> 00:38:08,318
so now we are just

698
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:08,319
getting a simple

699
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:16,079
leave and now let's suppose that the

700
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:19,079
growth rates associated with vins are

701
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:19,079
changed

702
00:38:35,199 --> 00:38:39,639
so now we are getting heart-shaped

703
00:38:47,039 --> 00:38:50,920
Leaf let's see one more

704
00:38:54,960 --> 00:39:01,720
example so coming from Canada I had to

705
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:01,720
model a maple

706
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:15,119
leaf so here it

707
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:21,440
comes so you can see that there are

708
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:25,519
smaller kind of indentations or which

709
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:28,200
are due to the presence of cak and

710
00:39:25,519 --> 00:39:30,639
deeper ones which are due to the

711
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:33,759
presence of nox which is kind of more

712
00:39:30,639 --> 00:39:33,759
sparely located at

713
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:43,000
C so if you further analyze the

714
00:39:39,719 --> 00:39:46,318
interplay between kak and no um we can

715
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:48,880
create this kind of morphos space which

716
00:39:46,318 --> 00:39:52,920
um okay so here it this kind of like

717
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:56,680
basic form if we increase repression of

718
00:39:52,920 --> 00:40:01,200
growth by cak we are getting well kind

719
00:39:56,679 --> 00:40:03,159
of form which is which simply has deeper

720
00:40:01,199 --> 00:40:06,159
uh

721
00:40:03,159 --> 00:40:07,838
Lopes if we increase it by noock we can

722
00:40:06,159 --> 00:40:10,000
get to the point where you have actual

723
00:40:07,838 --> 00:40:13,000
progress to a leaf which is compound

724
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,000
which has three different

725
00:40:15,159 --> 00:40:22,279
leaflets okay so I could pretty much

726
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:23,599
move to conclusions here but if well if

727
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:26,319
um you wouldn't mind I would like to

728
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:29,519
spend five minutes talking about

729
00:40:26,318 --> 00:40:31,279
something which may appear completely

730
00:40:29,519 --> 00:40:33,280
different and I hope you will be

731
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:36,480
surprised that actually it is not so

732
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:40,359
completely different and it is in

733
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:42,559
fluorescences so this is a field of uh

734
00:40:40,358 --> 00:40:46,639
well common

735
00:40:42,559 --> 00:40:50,078
yo and this is if well kind of a picture

736
00:40:46,639 --> 00:40:52,920
of Yo from the top and also diagrammatic

737
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:55,720
construction from which representation

738
00:40:52,920 --> 00:41:00,039
from which one can see that actually one

739
00:40:55,719 --> 00:41:01,719
uh feature of this infest and many other

740
00:41:00,039 --> 00:41:05,039
many other

741
00:41:01,719 --> 00:41:08,000
inferences together known as corms is

742
00:41:05,039 --> 00:41:10,599
that they form a very flat

743
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:13,440
surface and this is related to the fact

744
00:41:10,599 --> 00:41:16,039
that they are pollinated well mainly by

745
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:18,960
flies which actually are walking on the

746
00:41:16,039 --> 00:41:21,119
INF forance and pollinating FL one

747
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:23,119
flower after another so from

748
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:25,480
evolutionary perspective it makes sense

749
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:28,400
for this to be flat but how this

750
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:31,280
flatness can happen in

751
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:33,559
nature so here is kind of well more

752
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:35,800
traditional point of view which looks at

753
00:41:33,559 --> 00:41:37,759
inflorescences as branching structures

754
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:40,160
decorated with flowers so we have some

755
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:44,040
branching structure which is looking

756
00:41:40,159 --> 00:41:46,960
like this and if we follow this

757
00:41:44,039 --> 00:41:49,679
idea then the branching structure would

758
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:51,880
have to grow according to quite complex

759
00:41:49,679 --> 00:41:55,199
trigonometric rules like for example in

760
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:58,039
order to bring this flower to the same

761
00:41:55,199 --> 00:42:00,759
height as this one well

762
00:41:58,039 --> 00:42:03,639
this S2 would have to be S1 cosine

763
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:06,760
Alpha and in order to bring this flower

764
00:42:03,639 --> 00:42:08,960
to the same level well even in two

765
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:11,040
Dimensions it the trigonometry becomes

766
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:12,720
more complex and if we imagine if we

767
00:42:11,039 --> 00:42:15,279
realize that is two

768
00:42:12,719 --> 00:42:17,639
Dimension structure where

769
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:19,920
synchronization of this growth rate to

770
00:42:17,639 --> 00:42:23,078
bring everything to the same level would

771
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:25,838
be well quite a difficult trigonometric

772
00:42:23,079 --> 00:42:30,160
problem on which many people would have

773
00:42:25,838 --> 00:42:32,480
well hard time well not making mistakes

774
00:42:30,159 --> 00:42:34,639
so it doesn't look very likely that

775
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:37,440
plant is doing this trigonometry to find

776
00:42:34,639 --> 00:42:40,039
out to bring or flowers to the same

777
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:43,800
level so this brings us to an

778
00:42:40,039 --> 00:42:46,719
alternative idea in which if it is not

779
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:50,440
so that infloresence is a branching

780
00:42:46,719 --> 00:42:53,480
structure decorated with flowers but

781
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:56,039
flowers are being created at the same

782
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:58,358
level and then branching structure is

783
00:42:56,039 --> 00:43:00,558
just scaffolding with cre

784
00:42:58,358 --> 00:43:03,078
well to support these

785
00:43:00,559 --> 00:43:05,599
flowers and this is idea which is very

786
00:43:03,079 --> 00:43:09,480
similar to the idea of development of

787
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:11,200
leaves so in this case in the well

788
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:13,920
should I

789
00:43:11,199 --> 00:43:17,799
beem um actually in the infes and marem

790
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:20,280
in this case we we have creation of a

791
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:22,440
number of convergence points here I drew

792
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:24,280
this in two Dimension but I will show

793
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:28,838
this in three dimension as

794
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:31,559
well and then as a structure grows

795
00:43:28,838 --> 00:43:34,639
vascular connections are created in the

796
00:43:31,559 --> 00:43:36,240
same way but in three dimensions as

797
00:43:34,639 --> 00:43:39,719
veins in a

798
00:43:36,239 --> 00:43:41,759
leaf and then in the same way in which

799
00:43:39,719 --> 00:43:46,399
indentations in leaf are

800
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:48,960
formed well we have these gaps in

801
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:51,358
between and eventually we wind up with a

802
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:54,280
branching structure

803
00:43:51,358 --> 00:43:56,078
supporting all flowers at the

804
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:57,880
approximately the same level and the

805
00:43:56,079 --> 00:43:59,800
only thing which we have to assume here

806
00:43:57,880 --> 00:44:01,358
is that growth is roughly uniform

807
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:04,519
throughout the

808
00:44:01,358 --> 00:44:06,358
structure so let's see whether it works

809
00:44:04,519 --> 00:44:08,719
so first we have to

810
00:44:06,358 --> 00:44:10,960
create well not a pattern of

811
00:44:08,719 --> 00:44:13,118
equidistance convergence points along

812
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:18,000
the leave margin but on the surface of

813
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:21,079
the merem so here it is using the first

814
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:24,679
available space algorithm we have

815
00:44:21,079 --> 00:44:29,280
vascular patter we have pattern of

816
00:44:24,679 --> 00:44:31,799
a let's say m new convergence points but

817
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:34,599
the infloresence of Arrow is compound so

818
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:36,559
we need to go a little bit

819
00:44:34,599 --> 00:44:39,920
further and

820
00:44:36,559 --> 00:44:44,119
assume that the primordia which are big

821
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:48,318
enough can create higher order primordia

822
00:44:44,119 --> 00:44:51,200
so this is the layout of individual

823
00:44:48,318 --> 00:44:55,358
flowers actually flower heads

824
00:44:51,199 --> 00:45:00,199
because now these flower

825
00:44:55,358 --> 00:45:00,199
heads are connected into a branching

826
00:45:01,679 --> 00:45:07,039
structure so this is how it goes each

827
00:45:04,358 --> 00:45:10,279
time when a primordium

828
00:45:07,039 --> 00:45:12,318
appears it is

829
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:14,079
connected into branching structure this

830
00:45:12,318 --> 00:45:15,599
is three dimensional thing you can look

831
00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:18,000
at this from the

832
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:21,960
from underneath and you can see how this

833
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:25,599
branching structure is formed as a

834
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:27,318
scaffolding supporting the flowers so

835
00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:30,359
proper arrangement of flowers comes

836
00:45:27,318 --> 00:45:34,480
first scaffolding comes

837
00:45:30,358 --> 00:45:34,480
next okay so we have this kind of

838
00:45:35,199 --> 00:45:41,480
layout

839
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:43,119
and if we now Place flowers where there

840
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:44,920
should be we are getting this kind of

841
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:47,680
model which is shown on the right you

842
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:51,318
can compare it to the model on the left

843
00:45:47,679 --> 00:45:53,318
so this is totally different ball game

844
00:45:51,318 --> 00:45:55,639
we no longer have leaves we have

845
00:45:53,318 --> 00:45:57,440
inflorescences but this is the same

846
00:45:55,639 --> 00:46:00,078
common denominator

847
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:01,559
formation of pattern of convergence of

848
00:46:00,079 --> 00:46:03,839
convergence points on the margin of the

849
00:46:01,559 --> 00:46:06,040
structure whether margin of the leaf or

850
00:46:03,838 --> 00:46:08,838
surface of the SU app Mar stem

851
00:46:06,039 --> 00:46:13,000
connection into vasculature and it f

852
00:46:08,838 --> 00:46:13,000
grows I have

853
00:46:14,679 --> 00:46:20,679
um

854
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:20,679
um yes one

855
00:46:20,838 --> 00:46:24,759
second I got a little

856
00:46:23,199 --> 00:46:28,919
bit

857
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:28,920
um have to go back sorry

858
00:46:36,599 --> 00:46:39,720
all these things which I removed from

859
00:46:38,199 --> 00:46:44,078
the

860
00:46:39,719 --> 00:46:44,078
presentation okay so I was

861
00:46:44,358 --> 00:46:47,358
here

862
00:46:47,519 --> 00:46:51,880
okay so this looks like the same model

863
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:55,318
but is actually this is not a picture

864
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:57,559
this is actual 3D model and you can

865
00:46:55,318 --> 00:46:58,838
see well

866
00:46:57,559 --> 00:47:01,200
kind of like how this branching

867
00:46:58,838 --> 00:47:05,000
structure and and layout of flowers

868
00:47:01,199 --> 00:47:08,078
looks like but you can also see here

869
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:08,079
another thing if you zoom

870
00:47:10,199 --> 00:47:15,358
in so for example you can see this here

871
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:18,119
or there what you can see is that the

872
00:47:15,358 --> 00:47:20,598
petals are intersecting each other and

873
00:47:18,119 --> 00:47:23,599
this is something which using computer

874
00:47:20,599 --> 00:47:26,039
models is quite difficult to avoid but

875
00:47:23,599 --> 00:47:27,960
if well nature clearly doesn't have

876
00:47:26,039 --> 00:47:30,679
problems with this because as already

877
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:32,760
aristal observed in the in the place

878
00:47:30,679 --> 00:47:35,879
where something is something else cannot

879
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:37,960
be so we spend actually substantial

880
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:39,920
amount of time trying to address this in

881
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:43,599
computer models as well and this is kind

882
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:45,760
of like well um current well stage of

883
00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:48,318
this work so in this case we have

884
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:51,280
employed well um relatively

885
00:47:48,318 --> 00:47:53,838
sophisticated algorithms for handling

886
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:56,440
biomechanically surfaces which collide

887
00:47:53,838 --> 00:47:58,639
with each other and you can see that in

888
00:47:56,440 --> 00:48:00,318
some cases for example in this petal it

889
00:47:58,639 --> 00:48:02,279
is kind of deflected because there was

890
00:48:00,318 --> 00:48:05,800
another one underneath which was pushing

891
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:08,119
it the same situation is here so we are

892
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:10,200
coming closer and closer to having a

893
00:48:08,119 --> 00:48:12,720
real arrow through the modeling it is

894
00:48:10,199 --> 00:48:15,960
amazing that actually

895
00:48:12,719 --> 00:48:19,118
what where so much energy goes is how to

896
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:19,119
compute this this

897
00:48:19,679 --> 00:48:25,480
intersections so concluding

898
00:48:23,199 --> 00:48:28,318
synthesis growth of leaves but not only

899
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:30,358
of leaves actually of well um many

900
00:48:28,318 --> 00:48:33,558
structures Pro proceed as

901
00:48:30,358 --> 00:48:36,719
follows we have um interplay between

902
00:48:33,559 --> 00:48:39,720
growth and form so form is a result of

903
00:48:36,719 --> 00:48:43,639
growth growth of leaves in

904
00:48:39,719 --> 00:48:45,399
fluorescences is driven by pattern of

905
00:48:43,639 --> 00:48:48,118
convergence point on the boundary which

906
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:51,280
specify where to grow and vasculature

907
00:48:48,119 --> 00:48:54,280
which specifies in which direction to

908
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:56,400
grow there is an interplay between a

909
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:59,440
pattern on the boundary and vasculature

910
00:48:56,400 --> 00:49:02,000
namely pattern of the boundary specifies

911
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:04,079
where the veins start and then where the

912
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:06,119
veins end is determined by either the

913
00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:09,960
base of the structure or presence of

914
00:49:06,119 --> 00:49:13,318
previous veins which explains this

915
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:15,798
feedback loop existing veins help

916
00:49:13,318 --> 00:49:17,519
determine where are going to where new

917
00:49:15,798 --> 00:49:21,719
veins are going to

918
00:49:17,519 --> 00:49:24,880
be and then there is this Loop which is

919
00:49:21,719 --> 00:49:28,279
H to H Meister that as things are being

920
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:31,160
coming bigger they create room for new

921
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:33,559
elements uh on the boundary new

922
00:49:31,159 --> 00:49:37,199
convergence points which are

923
00:49:33,559 --> 00:49:41,680
placed uh between existing

924
00:49:37,199 --> 00:49:44,039
ones and finally as if the things grow

925
00:49:41,679 --> 00:49:47,039
they can modify vascular and Vascular

926
00:49:44,039 --> 00:49:49,920
may have also um an impact on where

927
00:49:47,039 --> 00:49:52,159
convergence points are

928
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:55,920
appearing so this leads to something

929
00:49:52,159 --> 00:49:58,159
like well more General well um

930
00:49:55,920 --> 00:50:01,318
conclusions conclusion which to me

931
00:49:58,159 --> 00:50:03,679
actually is almost obvious except that

932
00:50:01,318 --> 00:50:06,599
sometimes when I state it well I have

933
00:50:03,679 --> 00:50:08,279
vicious opposition to the idea and it is

934
00:50:06,599 --> 00:50:10,280
that mechanistic understanding of plant

935
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:12,798
form from molecular level patterning to

936
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:15,559
microscopic form appears to be within

937
00:50:12,798 --> 00:50:18,119
the reach we are finding more and more

938
00:50:15,559 --> 00:50:19,960
details and and well it might be so that

939
00:50:18,119 --> 00:50:22,318
some theories which we have already will

940
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:24,159
have to be replaced by others or refined

941
00:50:22,318 --> 00:50:25,798
like in the case of this AB gradient

942
00:50:24,159 --> 00:50:27,719
patterning of oxin which is now being

943
00:50:25,798 --> 00:50:31,318
refined to well a more posible

944
00:50:27,719 --> 00:50:33,399
hypothesis but out of this a picture

945
00:50:31,318 --> 00:50:36,358
emerges which can actually mean that

946
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:38,079
biology may be moving more and more in

947
00:50:36,358 --> 00:50:40,519
the direction of physics where we have

948
00:50:38,079 --> 00:50:41,280
some underlying principles and then lot

949
00:50:40,519 --> 00:50:45,719
of

950
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:48,960
things emerg from this so um Ernest

951
00:50:45,719 --> 00:50:51,480
raford famously said that well every

952
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:52,679
well all science is either physics or

953
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:55,199
stamp

954
00:50:52,679 --> 00:50:56,798
collection and it seems that well

955
00:50:55,199 --> 00:50:59,919
development of biology is moving moving

956
00:50:56,798 --> 00:51:01,559
closer and closer to this well um

957
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:03,599
physical understanding of the world

958
00:51:01,559 --> 00:51:05,119
where we have relatively small number of

959
00:51:03,599 --> 00:51:08,000
general principles and lot of things can

960
00:51:05,119 --> 00:51:10,358
be deduced from this and genetic

961
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:12,199
mechanism are setting up the playground

962
00:51:10,358 --> 00:51:14,880
for for these processes but many of them

963
00:51:12,199 --> 00:51:17,399
have self organizing character as shown

964
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:21,798
here so I would like to acknowledge Adam

965
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:25,240
ranion and Adam uh Andre Owens so Adam

966
00:51:21,798 --> 00:51:27,480
ranons was the um primary person behind

967
00:51:25,239 --> 00:51:29,598
the leaves Andre Owens is working on

968
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:36,240
tenses and we are collaborating with

969
00:51:29,599 --> 00:51:38,760
milanes on leavs and reg bov from well

970
00:51:36,239 --> 00:51:40,118
Johannes Gutenberg University in mines

971
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:42,890
on INF

972
00:51:40,119 --> 00:51:45,980
forensis thank you very

973
00:51:42,889 --> 00:51:45,980
[Applause]

974
00:51:46,519 --> 00:51:51,798
much yes please you want to ask this

975
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:55,160
question based on the fact that the um

976
00:51:51,798 --> 00:52:00,000
you had a mechanism with the cells were

977
00:51:55,159 --> 00:52:03,679
sensing inux and in that there was some

978
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:05,880
asymmetry so um based on that I wondered

979
00:52:03,679 --> 00:52:08,399
if your model a second order with

980
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:12,039
respect to space and time or first order

981
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:14,880
with respect to space and time um and

982
00:52:12,039 --> 00:52:17,000
why did you choose it okay what do you

983
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:18,680
mean by first order with respect of

984
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:21,838
space and time and second order so for

985
00:52:18,679 --> 00:52:26,919
example Max equations

986
00:52:21,838 --> 00:52:29,039
which would model your ersion points is

987
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:32,760
second order and the

988
00:52:29,039 --> 00:52:34,039
solutions are first order but um if you

989
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:38,559
put your

990
00:52:34,039 --> 00:52:43,480
controls um two different um two

991
00:52:38,559 --> 00:52:45,559
different in kns um and had them affect

992
00:52:43,480 --> 00:52:48,199
the second order you'll get an

993
00:52:45,559 --> 00:52:52,519
asymmetry then um differently than if

994
00:52:48,199 --> 00:52:55,679
you put it in the first order so yeah so

995
00:52:52,519 --> 00:52:59,559
in the so if to begin with in the model

996
00:52:55,679 --> 00:53:01,960
with if in which we have um this um

997
00:52:59,559 --> 00:53:04,599
polarization by un unidirectional

998
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:08,358
fluxes if

999
00:53:04,599 --> 00:53:11,160
so it is described by by the set of

1000
00:53:08,358 --> 00:53:15,159
first order equations so we don't in

1001
00:53:11,159 --> 00:53:16,719
particular observe second order well

1002
00:53:15,159 --> 00:53:19,399
phenomena which would be kind of like

1003
00:53:16,719 --> 00:53:22,838
waves propagating

1004
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:24,639
um which which which which is related to

1005
00:53:22,838 --> 00:53:26,798
well oscillations of this type do don't

1006
00:53:24,639 --> 00:53:28,598
don't occur which does don't does mean

1007
00:53:26,798 --> 00:53:30,199
that they cannot second thing is that

1008
00:53:28,599 --> 00:53:33,400
this result is quite new we didn't

1009
00:53:30,199 --> 00:53:37,598
connect it with cck and nox we have only

1010
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:40,599
oxin and pin if well we have only we

1011
00:53:37,599 --> 00:53:44,240
have oxen pin and some

1012
00:53:40,599 --> 00:53:48,400
Network which is detecting

1013
00:53:44,239 --> 00:53:52,479
um the measuring outx and influx so

1014
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:55,920
mathematical analysis of this of this um

1015
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:57,119
entire model is still to uh to happen

1016
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:59,358
but we have

1017
00:53:57,119 --> 00:54:03,079
done quite an extensive set of

1018
00:53:59,358 --> 00:54:05,798
simulations showing that we have well

1019
00:54:03,079 --> 00:54:10,240
this um convergence Point formation in

1020
00:54:05,798 --> 00:54:12,838
one case polarization if well um kind of

1021
00:54:10,239 --> 00:54:15,519
long distance polarization consistent

1022
00:54:12,838 --> 00:54:17,719
with canalization so coordinated one in

1023
00:54:15,519 --> 00:54:20,759
the other case that the switch from one

1024
00:54:17,719 --> 00:54:24,078
to another mode well that actually the

1025
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:26,680
in the impact of influx can be very

1026
00:54:24,079 --> 00:54:29,960
small so if you look into the feedback

1027
00:54:26,679 --> 00:54:35,759
loop which is driving well polarization

1028
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:38,880
of pins and compares the strengths of

1029
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:41,359
influence of outflux to

1030
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:44,358
influx forming a linear form so that

1031
00:54:41,358 --> 00:54:48,039
let's say over all polarization is well

1032
00:54:44,358 --> 00:54:50,960
outflux plus Alpha influx then if Alpha

1033
00:54:48,039 --> 00:54:52,880
changes the sign we have change of

1034
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:55,358
situation from one to another type of

1035
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:57,119
polarization but Alpha can be very small

1036
00:54:55,358 --> 00:55:00,279
kind of like let's say one thousand of

1037
00:54:57,119 --> 00:55:03,519
the impact of outflux so it seems that

1038
00:55:00,280 --> 00:55:07,079
influx is this kind of well controlling

1039
00:55:03,519 --> 00:55:10,119
thing so I may have not answer your

1040
00:55:07,079 --> 00:55:12,280
question well directly but I I told you

1041
00:55:10,119 --> 00:55:14,599
what what what we know the results which

1042
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:18,079
we have now are basically simulation

1043
00:55:14,599 --> 00:55:22,039
results and we qualitatively understand

1044
00:55:18,079 --> 00:55:28,079
why it is why this sign of

1045
00:55:22,039 --> 00:55:30,920
um what the sign of of er influence of

1046
00:55:28,079 --> 00:55:34,359
influx causes this qualitative change in

1047
00:55:30,920 --> 00:55:35,519
behavior um but if unlike previous

1048
00:55:34,358 --> 00:55:37,558
models of oxen which have been

1049
00:55:35,519 --> 00:55:41,199
mathematically analyzed

1050
00:55:37,559 --> 00:55:43,680
quite quite extensively this one we have

1051
00:55:41,199 --> 00:55:45,759
not analyzed yet we have a paper which

1052
00:55:43,679 --> 00:55:48,118
has been accepted and and the main

1053
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:51,079
attention of reviewers was actually not

1054
00:55:48,119 --> 00:55:53,880
on the mathematical analysis but was on

1055
00:55:51,079 --> 00:55:56,640
well what kind of um

1056
00:55:53,880 --> 00:55:58,720
potential mechanism

1057
00:55:56,639 --> 00:56:00,920
at the molecular level could be involved

1058
00:55:58,719 --> 00:56:02,519
and we HTI it about this so I could

1059
00:56:00,920 --> 00:56:05,680
entertain more discussion about this

1060
00:56:02,519 --> 00:56:10,000
than about well actual mathematical

1061
00:56:05,679 --> 00:56:12,598
properties of of the model okay yes so

1062
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:15,880
what I find really interesting in your

1063
00:56:12,599 --> 00:56:19,079
models is that she using relatively few

1064
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:21,920
variables I mean there's an interplay of

1065
00:56:19,079 --> 00:56:24,960
just less than a handful of genes that

1066
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:26,760
would contribute to the and I wonder if

1067
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:29,119
using your model you

1068
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:31,400
can look like I don't know if it's

1069
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:34,720
possible go outside of the Lea that you

1070
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:38,358
looked at and try to predict if if

1071
00:56:34,719 --> 00:56:41,399
basically how close within reach are you

1072
00:56:38,358 --> 00:56:44,119
predicting what we see in in nature like

1073
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:45,680
would can you tell if you missing a

1074
00:56:44,119 --> 00:56:48,640
character let's say it would be group of

1075
00:56:45,679 --> 00:56:50,960
species that has another Gene that is in

1076
00:56:48,639 --> 00:56:51,759
the same pathway can you can you figure

1077
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:55,679
that

1078
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:58,880
out so so here this more of a

1079
00:56:55,679 --> 00:57:01,719
hypothetical type of question because

1080
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:04,000
well not not so much is known about well

1081
00:57:01,719 --> 00:57:06,199
what happens let's say regarding

1082
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:08,838
different species of species of plants

1083
00:57:06,199 --> 00:57:11,519
what is actually known is Prim know for

1084
00:57:08,838 --> 00:57:15,719
arop cardamine and

1085
00:57:11,519 --> 00:57:18,239
tomato if so if but the models are

1086
00:57:15,719 --> 00:57:20,078
operating if in such a way that they're

1087
00:57:18,239 --> 00:57:22,358
assuming are genes which are cing

1088
00:57:20,079 --> 00:57:24,318
something so we are abstracting rather

1089
00:57:22,358 --> 00:57:26,719
than thinking directly in terms of genes

1090
00:57:24,318 --> 00:57:29,599
we are thinking about in terms of

1091
00:57:26,719 --> 00:57:31,919
geometric properties geometric pattern

1092
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:33,720
properties which can be which are

1093
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:35,680
dependent on the genes and then how this

1094
00:57:33,719 --> 00:57:39,199
geometric patterning processes result in

1095
00:57:35,679 --> 00:57:43,879
actual patterns so well kind

1096
00:57:39,199 --> 00:57:46,719
of primary role is if um in this models

1097
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:48,599
is allocated to the way distances are

1098
00:57:46,719 --> 00:57:50,919
measured how the measurement of the

1099
00:57:48,599 --> 00:57:54,200
distances can be modified by substances

1100
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:56,519
which are expressed on the on the margin

1101
00:57:54,199 --> 00:57:59,679
and a little bit combinatorics sort of

1102
00:57:56,519 --> 00:58:02,079
in this the in the sense of ABC model of

1103
00:57:59,679 --> 00:58:06,118
flower development combinatorics of this

1104
00:58:02,079 --> 00:58:08,280
morphogens on the on the margin so it is

1105
00:58:06,119 --> 00:58:10,720
very possible that there is there are

1106
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:12,559
many genes which are involved because

1107
00:58:10,719 --> 00:58:14,279
many genes may may have effect of

1108
00:58:12,559 --> 00:58:18,119
increasing distances decreasing

1109
00:58:14,280 --> 00:58:20,880
distances so if so um the fact that we

1110
00:58:18,119 --> 00:58:25,079
can represent these things in terms of

1111
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:26,400
um small number of of variables doesn't

1112
00:58:25,079 --> 00:58:28,798
mean that a small number of gen is

1113
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:32,599
involved because well as I said they can

1114
00:58:28,798 --> 00:58:35,798
be well many gen acting in the same or

1115
00:58:32,599 --> 00:58:38,079
similar manner but at the same time the

1116
00:58:35,798 --> 00:58:41,038
fact that such a small number of

1117
00:58:38,079 --> 00:58:44,079
parameters involved I think it is

1118
00:58:41,039 --> 00:58:46,599
correlated with the fact that in in

1119
00:58:44,079 --> 00:58:49,640
which was my opening statement that in

1120
00:58:46,599 --> 00:58:51,760
nature this change of form is very

1121
00:58:49,639 --> 00:58:54,279
easily achievable especially the change

1122
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:56,720
of form between simple and and compound

1123
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:58,359
in spite of the fact that to our eye

1124
00:58:56,719 --> 00:59:01,480
there is a huge difference in this forms

1125
00:58:58,358 --> 00:59:04,119
but but to a plant this is not a big

1126
00:59:01,480 --> 00:59:06,159
deal so I think that this is actually

1127
00:59:04,119 --> 00:59:09,240
sort of guiding information that if it

1128
00:59:06,159 --> 00:59:12,960
is easy to do for in nature it should be

1129
00:59:09,239 --> 00:59:15,118
also easy to do well in the model and in

1130
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:18,000
this in this sense is the fact that that

1131
00:59:15,119 --> 00:59:20,280
a small number of parameters is to me

1132
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:22,480
kind of like well indirect well not

1133
00:59:20,280 --> 00:59:26,400
confirmation but a well signs that we

1134
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:29,798
are probably maybe on on the right path

1135
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:33,358
so and actually it is very satisfying

1136
00:59:29,798 --> 00:59:34,599
that it can be so now if you look

1137
00:59:33,358 --> 00:59:37,519
everything depends on the level of

1138
00:59:34,599 --> 00:59:40,640
detail for example if if if you look

1139
00:59:37,519 --> 00:59:42,119
into well kind of text on anatomy of

1140
00:59:40,639 --> 00:59:43,798
leaves or

1141
00:59:42,119 --> 00:59:46,400
or

1142
00:59:43,798 --> 00:59:48,159
also detail description of shape for

1143
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:50,160
example there is entire classification

1144
00:59:48,159 --> 00:59:52,118
regarding well what is exactly the shape

1145
00:59:50,159 --> 00:59:54,038
of the tip are they like this are they

1146
00:59:52,119 --> 00:59:57,480
like this are they like this or like

1147
00:59:54,039 --> 01:00:00,440
that and the well if so we didn't look

1148
00:59:57,480 --> 01:00:02,318
into this in full detail but well our

1149
01:00:00,440 --> 01:00:05,920
gut feeling is that those might be very

1150
01:00:02,318 --> 01:00:09,599
much well again not controlled directly

1151
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:12,000
by genes but mechanical properties of of

1152
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:14,480
the margin and blade are controlled

1153
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:15,798
result resulting in the different shapes

1154
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:18,679
so

1155
01:00:15,798 --> 01:00:20,440
um so this is this is kind of definition

1156
01:00:18,679 --> 01:00:21,879
not not not the end of the story We

1157
01:00:20,440 --> 01:00:24,679
would like also to create more

1158
01:00:21,880 --> 01:00:26,838
comprehensive Mor morphos spaces I we

1159
01:00:24,679 --> 01:00:28,598
created a few of them I showed plus one

1160
01:00:26,838 --> 01:00:31,119
but I wouldn't say that that I feel that

1161
01:00:28,599 --> 01:00:34,519
we have covered the entire morphos space

1162
01:00:31,119 --> 01:00:36,519
of our leaves and but I think that is

1163
01:00:34,519 --> 01:00:39,559
Within Reach

1164
01:00:36,519 --> 01:00:41,440
okay yes so in your early models where

1165
01:00:39,559 --> 01:00:44,519
you're just looking at the effect of

1166
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:46,639
oxin and not including KNX and and C um

1167
01:00:44,519 --> 01:00:49,519
you can pretty well reproduce the the

1168
01:00:46,639 --> 01:00:50,960
shape of a Rabbid opy I'm curious about

1169
01:00:49,519 --> 01:00:52,920
the relationship between the

1170
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:54,400
concentration of oxin at the margins and

1171
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:57,200
the rate of Le expansion which

1172
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:59,480
presumably also your later models as

1173
01:00:57,199 --> 01:01:02,199
well because if you look at the the

1174
01:00:59,480 --> 01:01:04,159
early Lea oxygen concentration seems to

1175
01:01:02,199 --> 01:01:07,000
be relatively uniform around the

1176
01:01:04,159 --> 01:01:10,239
periphery that is the leaf expands that

1177
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:12,480
gets more localized right but one of the

1178
01:01:10,239 --> 01:01:14,959
things that didn't that didn't seem

1179
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:17,199
quite right was you saw very large

1180
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:19,440
gradients and oxen concentration along

1181
01:01:17,199 --> 01:01:21,078
the margins of the leaves but it didn't

1182
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:23,760
appear that there were large gradients

1183
01:01:21,079 --> 01:01:26,440
in the rates of elongation or or

1184
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:28,319
expansion of the margins so you had high

1185
01:01:26,440 --> 01:01:30,798
concentrations of oxin in the

1186
01:01:28,318 --> 01:01:32,719
convergence points low in the in the

1187
01:01:30,798 --> 01:01:35,199
valleys there but the rates of leaf

1188
01:01:32,719 --> 01:01:40,719
expansion between those didn't seem to

1189
01:01:35,199 --> 01:01:43,919
be much yes so the example of of this um

1190
01:01:40,719 --> 01:01:47,919
arop Leaf is is perfect perfect well

1191
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:51,440
example this category so if I what I

1192
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:54,000
described is well um a part of the story

1193
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:56,200
which is which was focused on the action

1194
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:58,838
of the formation of serration but

1195
01:01:56,199 --> 01:02:01,879
actually this process is well

1196
01:01:58,838 --> 01:02:06,759
superimposed if on the Assumption there

1197
01:02:01,880 --> 01:02:09,599
is an overall if well gradient of leap

1198
01:02:06,760 --> 01:02:11,440
expansion so so so and then well in in

1199
01:02:09,599 --> 01:02:13,000
the paper where we describe this this

1200
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:16,079
this model is described in painful

1201
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:18,480
detail but this is this is the basic

1202
01:02:16,079 --> 01:02:20,760
part of the story that that that it was

1203
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:23,480
focusing on theformation of additional

1204
01:02:20,760 --> 01:02:25,278
features right so you're looking at the

1205
01:02:23,480 --> 01:02:26,679
additional expansion that's caused by

1206
01:02:25,278 --> 01:02:27,960
the higho

1207
01:02:26,679 --> 01:02:29,838
in the case of arabidopsis and the

1208
01:02:27,960 --> 01:02:32,720
reason for this why it may be so

1209
01:02:29,838 --> 01:02:34,440
precisely that is that well if there's

1210
01:02:32,719 --> 01:02:36,239
no no there so there is not much

1211
01:02:34,440 --> 01:02:38,240
potentiation once we put the noock there

1212
01:02:36,239 --> 01:02:40,439
we have bigger effect and is what

1213
01:02:38,239 --> 01:02:42,118
happens yes please forgive me if I

1214
01:02:40,440 --> 01:02:43,639
missed it you might have mentioned it

1215
01:02:42,119 --> 01:02:48,880
but

1216
01:02:43,639 --> 01:02:53,038
you have you successfully mapped the

1217
01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:56,559
vascular architecture onto the leaf more

1218
01:02:53,039 --> 01:02:59,119
so in other words if the model has

1219
01:02:56,559 --> 01:03:01,000
looking traditional validation and

1220
01:02:59,119 --> 01:03:03,480
there's got to be or at least there

1221
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:06,920
should be a reasonable one toone mapping

1222
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:12,480
between the primary vascul and the

1223
01:03:06,920 --> 01:03:14,318
actual outline of the Le itself yes so

1224
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:18,000
in some cases like for example in the

1225
01:03:14,318 --> 01:03:21,920
case of of of of maple here it is not so

1226
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:23,798
far away um in other cases we are very

1227
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:26,480
far because actually we are assuming

1228
01:03:23,798 --> 01:03:30,000
here that if well if from what I

1229
01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:32,079
described is kind of um evident that

1230
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:35,559
that we limited

1231
01:03:32,079 --> 01:03:38,278
to nonre non reticulate vascular systems

1232
01:03:35,559 --> 01:03:41,960
so open vascular systems we don't have

1233
01:03:38,278 --> 01:03:44,798
loops but well Loops are well very

1234
01:03:41,960 --> 01:03:47,880
prominent feature of many many leaves

1235
01:03:44,798 --> 01:03:50,038
and so we so we don't have it there is

1236
01:03:47,880 --> 01:03:52,278
some rationale for this according to

1237
01:03:50,039 --> 01:03:56,119
scarpella model

1238
01:03:52,278 --> 01:03:59,358
of venation formation even in is the

1239
01:03:56,119 --> 01:04:00,798
case of when we have loops in a leaf

1240
01:03:59,358 --> 01:04:03,838
veins start in the way which are

1241
01:04:00,798 --> 01:04:05,960
described but a little bit later on this

1242
01:04:03,838 --> 01:04:10,759
connection between convergence point and

1243
01:04:05,960 --> 01:04:13,039
and actual base is and vein is is is

1244
01:04:10,760 --> 01:04:16,278
well disappears and a vein is being

1245
01:04:13,039 --> 01:04:18,760
formed so even in the case of leaves

1246
01:04:16,278 --> 01:04:22,358
which have loops

1247
01:04:18,760 --> 01:04:25,480
initial process is such as I

1248
01:04:22,358 --> 01:04:26,239
described or seems to be and nobody

1249
01:04:25,480 --> 01:04:29,519
knows

1250
01:04:26,239 --> 01:04:34,159
how actually well looped um um vation

1251
01:04:29,519 --> 01:04:37,000
systems are are created so we spent

1252
01:04:34,159 --> 01:04:40,038
considerable amount of time and and well

1253
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:42,960
I I have another talk about well V PS

1254
01:04:40,039 --> 01:04:46,480
well specifically and we have we can

1255
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:48,079
create some kind of of loops and it was

1256
01:04:46,480 --> 01:04:50,798
already part of the first model of

1257
01:04:48,079 --> 01:04:53,000
mesons that he had some kind of Loops

1258
01:04:50,798 --> 01:04:54,960
produced in in his model of vascular P

1259
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:58,000
information but none of these models

1260
01:04:54,960 --> 01:05:00,278
actually is very robust or or looks like

1261
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:03,358
very much like real thing so I would say

1262
01:05:00,278 --> 01:05:05,760
that well if if we have the situation

1263
01:05:03,358 --> 01:05:09,278
that vasculature if which is formed

1264
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:11,960
initially persists to later forms rather

1265
01:05:09,278 --> 01:05:14,199
than creating

1266
01:05:11,960 --> 01:05:17,240
close reorganizing itself into Clos

1267
01:05:14,199 --> 01:05:19,078
Loops then if well we can see reasonable

1268
01:05:17,239 --> 01:05:22,838
correspondence between our vascular

1269
01:05:19,079 --> 01:05:25,240
systems and and reality but when Loops

1270
01:05:22,838 --> 01:05:26,960
are formed then then we don't and I

1271
01:05:25,239 --> 01:05:30,318
would like to at some moment to have

1272
01:05:26,960 --> 01:05:32,639
this well um moment of of of

1273
01:05:30,318 --> 01:05:34,239
Illumination and finding oh so this is

1274
01:05:32,639 --> 01:05:35,960
how Loops are formed but it didn't

1275
01:05:34,239 --> 01:05:40,118
happen

1276
01:05:35,960 --> 01:05:42,480
yet okay okay one more question oh

1277
01:05:40,119 --> 01:05:46,880
there's a lot of

1278
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:50,480
questions okay so how it seems like you

1279
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:52,200
can match the final form of the model to

1280
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:54,960
quite well but how closely does this

1281
01:05:52,199 --> 01:05:56,679
match the developmental series like

1282
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:59,599
halfway through through the simulation

1283
01:05:56,679 --> 01:06:01,719
if you stop it does it look like the Le

1284
01:05:59,599 --> 01:06:05,160
halfway

1285
01:06:01,719 --> 01:06:10,318
through yeah so if in the case of

1286
01:06:05,159 --> 01:06:12,118
arabidopsis it looks actually um okay we

1287
01:06:10,318 --> 01:06:14,038
we if as I mentioned basically we are

1288
01:06:12,119 --> 01:06:16,720
just assuming that that there's some

1289
01:06:14,039 --> 01:06:19,960
pattern of of of growth but there is

1290
01:06:16,719 --> 01:06:22,239
actually a sequence of emergence of

1291
01:06:19,960 --> 01:06:25,318
serration and our model reproduces this

1292
01:06:22,239 --> 01:06:28,358
this sequence correctly and so it is the

1293
01:06:25,318 --> 01:06:30,838
case in well in the case of kardam

1294
01:06:28,358 --> 01:06:33,358
however in the case of kardam our model

1295
01:06:30,838 --> 01:06:37,199
is actually describing correctly the

1296
01:06:33,358 --> 01:06:39,719
early phases and not the later ones and

1297
01:06:37,199 --> 01:06:44,078
the reason for this is that

1298
01:06:39,719 --> 01:06:48,399
actually in the case of um kadam you can

1299
01:06:44,079 --> 01:06:52,000
see this long sinin segments of Reis and

1300
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:56,200
pules and if and actually it is not

1301
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:59,079
clear if at all what factor create this

1302
01:06:56,199 --> 01:07:01,199
kind of very this kind of linear organs

1303
01:06:59,079 --> 01:07:03,440
so this is this is a good question and

1304
01:07:01,199 --> 01:07:05,159
people are looking for what gen can be

1305
01:07:03,440 --> 01:07:07,679
and and well one day there is some

1306
01:07:05,159 --> 01:07:10,519
candidate another day day is improved so

1307
01:07:07,679 --> 01:07:13,879
we assumed that there is something there

1308
01:07:10,519 --> 01:07:16,159
if but it has to do with no but no by

1309
01:07:13,880 --> 01:07:19,519
itself is not sufficient so so this is

1310
01:07:16,159 --> 01:07:22,078
an example where we we can

1311
01:07:19,519 --> 01:07:25,400
actually sort of simulate development of

1312
01:07:22,079 --> 01:07:27,760
younger forms but we cannot go further

1313
01:07:25,400 --> 01:07:29,720
away way and then actually there is well

1314
01:07:27,760 --> 01:07:32,839
lot of things which are related to the

1315
01:07:29,719 --> 01:07:35,798
fact that in many leaves especially in

1316
01:07:32,838 --> 01:07:38,920
trees leaves are developing initially in

1317
01:07:35,798 --> 01:07:40,480
a form which is folded so well the

1318
01:07:38,920 --> 01:07:43,000
question is to what extent the fact that

1319
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:45,798
it is folded and within a bat which

1320
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:49,000
provides constraints May provide an well

1321
01:07:45,798 --> 01:07:50,920
important developmental cues so if so

1322
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:53,278
this is a factor to which to some extent

1323
01:07:50,920 --> 01:07:54,559
we have we have been looking at and some

1324
01:07:53,278 --> 01:07:56,679
other people have been looking at as

1325
01:07:54,559 --> 01:07:58,278
well but if it's the model which I have

1326
01:07:56,679 --> 01:08:01,278
shown it here this has not been

1327
01:07:58,278 --> 01:08:04,079
integrated so I would say that this is

1328
01:08:01,278 --> 01:08:07,278
that in some cases we can capture

1329
01:08:04,079 --> 01:08:07,278
this let's

1330
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:15,519
take this has been a production of

1331
01:08:12,639 --> 01:08:18,519
Cornell University on the web at

1332
01:08:15,519 --> 01:08:18,520
