00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:05,318
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,320
University all right so as you all can

3
00:00:05,318 --> 00:00:10,039
see uh watching us and the live or the

4
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:12,359
video or listen to us on the podcast

5
00:00:10,039 --> 00:00:14,119
we're joined by Dr kale Bigalow uh

6
00:00:12,359 --> 00:00:16,399
professor and leader of the turf grass

7
00:00:14,119 --> 00:00:18,079
program one of the leaders uh I think

8
00:00:16,399 --> 00:00:20,239
the leader certainly in the teaching

9
00:00:18,079 --> 00:00:22,038
area of the Purdue turf grass program

10
00:00:20,239 --> 00:00:24,000
you don't have to tell everybody Cal I'm

11
00:00:22,039 --> 00:00:27,960
trying to make make a big deal here but

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,278
I will say as we get started um always

13
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:32,439
I'm starting to get worried now that

14
00:00:30,278 --> 00:00:35,159
dogs are starting to you know have to

15
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:36,878
work a fair amount and and we're not

16
00:00:35,159 --> 00:00:39,078
really considering them as the labor

17
00:00:36,878 --> 00:00:42,159
force and you know as you know Carl we

18
00:00:39,079 --> 00:00:45,239
started out with a with a uh a skin

19
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:47,878
machine and then a sand Pro uh now

20
00:00:45,238 --> 00:00:50,000
running robots changing cups uh it

21
00:00:47,878 --> 00:00:51,920
doesn't seem to be uh any end to what

22
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,039
we'll get there and since we're in a

23
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:58,760
mood uh for a little bit of Calamity um

24
00:00:56,039 --> 00:01:01,558
uh I will uh if anybody is willing to

25
00:00:58,759 --> 00:01:03,558
take that code down and send money in uh

26
00:01:01,558 --> 00:01:06,519
I'll be happy to send a picture of you

27
00:01:03,558 --> 00:01:09,280
with this of me having a pie thrown in

28
00:01:06,519 --> 00:01:12,239
my face by my a science students uh

29
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:15,640
which I know will do it with great love

30
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:18,519
um I'll also uh sort of entree into our

31
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:21,799
conversation today Carl about you know

32
00:01:18,519 --> 00:01:24,158
what's going on this spring um and and

33
00:01:21,799 --> 00:01:26,520
particularly the story is is obviously

34
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:28,479
wet and we walked around the beautiful

35
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:30,959
lakes Shore uh golf and yach Club

36
00:01:28,478 --> 00:01:33,319
Yesterday up up along lake oida with the

37
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:36,039
walkin talk and we saw a fair amount of

38
00:01:33,319 --> 00:01:37,519
this out there so the spring is upon us

39
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:40,118
what's your thoughts about the growing

40
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:41,438
season getting going yes so one of the

41
00:01:40,118 --> 00:01:42,920
things we talked about yesterday Frank

42
00:01:41,438 --> 00:01:45,158
and and we've seen some sort of chatter

43
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:47,478
about it on on various social media

44
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:49,640
platforms is Golf Course superintendent

45
00:01:47,478 --> 00:01:51,920
is opening earlier right and this idea

46
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:53,879
that the growing season is extending and

47
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,159
the nrcc folks they've got some really

48
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:58,438
good good uh visuals of how this has

49
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:59,960
changed over the years so what uh people

50
00:01:58,438 --> 00:02:02,038
could see on the screen is the last

51
00:01:59,959 --> 00:02:04,559
spring frost a so sort of an indication

52
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:06,439
of I know for gardeners who are putting

53
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,560
uh veggies in stuff like that you know

54
00:02:06,438 --> 00:02:10,478
they got to get them in after that last

55
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:13,120
frost in the spring and you can see how

56
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:15,120
this is sort of shifted uh earlier into

57
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,280
the season so that last spring Frost is

58
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:19,039
happening a little bit earlier uh about

59
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,039
three to seven days earlier depending on

60
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:23,000
where you're looking there on the map uh

61
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:25,199
and then in the fall when the first fall

62
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,280
Frost happens so that sort of last frost

63
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:29,359
in the spring to First Frost in the fall

64
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,360
is sort of that that growing season we

65
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:33,120
can think about out uh and in the fall

66
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,959
it seems to be extending even more than

67
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,360
the spring so 3 to seven days earlier on

68
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:39,479
the spring 7 to 10 days later in the

69
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,599
fall and all this means is it's just a

70
00:02:39,479 --> 00:02:43,359
longer growing season so more time that

71
00:02:41,598 --> 00:02:45,479
we're managing Turf whether it's Golf

72
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:47,239
Course superintendent Sports field

73
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:49,439
managers or the landscapers getting out

74
00:02:47,239 --> 00:02:50,959
there earlier on the landscape and and

75
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:52,919
actually for me as a golfer the best way

76
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:55,000
to think about when the season starts is

77
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:56,559
Frank can I play golf can you just tell

78
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,080
me when I can play golf that's when the

79
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:01,360
growing season starts and we have data

80
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:03,599
from from the PO folks uh who have an

81
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,400
algorithm that calculates when is the

82
00:03:03,598 --> 00:03:07,679
weather that's conducive to golf you

83
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:09,000
know 45 degrees the forecast has to be

84
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,319
good there's got to be some light out

85
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,598
there and what we're finding is is in

86
00:03:11,318 --> 00:03:15,798
New York and the data we have we're

87
00:03:13,598 --> 00:03:18,479
getting that that this capacity for

88
00:03:15,799 --> 00:03:21,439
Rounds these days when you can play golf

89
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:23,679
uh out there in January in February in

90
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:25,280
December even Upstate here in New York

91
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:28,040
these are just three locations for for

92
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:30,000
folks watching uh so is it is indeed

93
00:03:28,039 --> 00:03:31,479
getting better easier to play golf in

94
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
the shoulders of the season the golfers

95
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:36,560
want to go do it should I go prepare the

96
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,280
golf course for the golfers uh maybe not

97
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,799
if you get stuck like here's here's a

98
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:42,158
picture of uh full disclosure this is me

99
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:43,519
getting stuck a couple years ago on the

100
00:03:42,158 --> 00:03:45,239
Cornell golf course I'm trying to get

101
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:48,080
out there getting data oh it's you know

102
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:49,878
ready to go right into the mud right and

103
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,599
and that goes hand inand with some other

104
00:03:49,878 --> 00:03:53,639
things we're seeing the percentage of

105
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:57,238
rain we're getting relative to normal

106
00:03:53,639 --> 00:04:00,199
all these Northeastern states there 140%

107
00:03:57,239 --> 00:04:01,959
200% of normal so far this year uh in

108
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:03,759
March so we got our golfers wanting to

109
00:04:01,959 --> 00:04:05,640
play golf it's warm but we got a lot of

110
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:08,078
moisture out there it's wet you know

111
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:10,399
should I open should I let golfers on my

112
00:04:08,079 --> 00:04:12,120
on my uh golf course there's some cool

113
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,760
traffic research out in Oregon State

114
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:15,319
right Pacific Northwest is sort of right

115
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:18,120
on the edge of being able to play golf

116
00:04:15,318 --> 00:04:19,639
most of those uh winter months uh they

117
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:22,680
decided to hey we're going to simulate

118
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:25,840
traffic at different levels 110 220

119
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:27,280
rounds 440 rounds per day on PO greens

120
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:30,839
and let's see what the turf quality

121
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:33,399
looks like from January through March

122
00:04:30,839 --> 00:04:35,560
what they found was hey even at 110

123
00:04:33,399 --> 00:04:38,079
rounds per day those poag greens hold up

124
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:40,000
pretty good uh now once you get to 220

125
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:43,000
rounds it declines now are you going to

126
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,120
do 220 rounds in the winter probably not

127
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,879
so the This research says is man if I

128
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:49,519
got po greens like it's okay if they go

129
00:04:47,879 --> 00:04:51,800
on the greens I'm probably more worried

130
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:53,680
about te's and and like you showed Frank

131
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:55,079
a cart traffic maybe our maintenance

132
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,600
workers or if you got me running around

133
00:04:55,079 --> 00:05:00,159
in your golf course maybe I shouldn't be

134
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:03,039
out there in a cart but for the I gotta

135
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:06,479
say Carl yeah this is really important

136
00:05:03,038 --> 00:05:08,918
work uh because as climates change right

137
00:05:06,478 --> 00:05:10,879
and we have these longer golfing Seasons

138
00:05:08,918 --> 00:05:12,758
the thing about rounds per day is and

139
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:15,800
we've learned this not everybody studies

140
00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:18,120
it the same way right and so you got to

141
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:20,879
move the cup around right to be able to

142
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:22,759
tolerate this on a cumulative basis

143
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:25,680
right you know you might have pinch

144
00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:28,439
points that if it if everybody's walking

145
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:31,560
in the same spot all the time it might

146
00:05:28,439 --> 00:05:33,079
only be 100 rounds a day or 50 rounds a

147
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:35,560
day that could cause that problem but I

148
00:05:33,079 --> 00:05:37,198
will say Carl before you move on we also

149
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:39,360
saw a fair amount of damage from the

150
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:41,600
workers right the workers themselves

151
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:43,680
getting out there doing that stuff yep

152
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,680
yeah and this is you know from from the

153
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,560
Athletics point of view you've also got

154
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:49,199
kids who want to get out there and and

155
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:51,000
play their Sports early on right K

156
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:52,520
through 12 you're playing sports in the

157
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
fall and the spring and that's when

158
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:56,959
growth is low too right so it's 45

159
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,519
degrees that's a great day if it's sunny

160
00:05:56,959 --> 00:06:00,478
to get out there and kick a soccer ball

161
00:05:58,519 --> 00:06:01,918
but is the grass growing probably not

162
00:06:00,478 --> 00:06:04,719
and this is what you see with Community

163
00:06:01,918 --> 00:06:07,318
athletic fields they get compacted early

164
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:09,639
on bearr what fills in probably

165
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:11,840
crabgrass that craps out early on and

166
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:14,280
and you basically never have a a safe or

167
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:16,279
highquality Athletic Field uh we ran

168
00:06:14,279 --> 00:06:18,079
across this this presentation from a

169
00:06:16,279 --> 00:06:20,439
California school district Frank that's

170
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:22,000
got these really interesting numbers on

171
00:06:20,439 --> 00:06:24,839
field use I don't know where these came

172
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,240
from I can't find any citations but they

173
00:06:24,839 --> 00:06:27,679
said in their presentation they're

174
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:30,120
looking at should we have synthetic or

175
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:33,680
natural grass a perfectly maintained

176
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:35,598
field can handle 10 hours per day of use

177
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,319
uh and and not every hour for every

178
00:06:35,598 --> 00:06:39,199
sport is is equal if it's football

179
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:40,919
that's worth like two hours if it's just

180
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:42,280
you know softball or baseball that's

181
00:06:40,918 --> 00:06:44,560
worth an hour but they're basically

182
00:06:42,279 --> 00:06:47,399
looking at hey if I have more than that

183
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:49,319
use even if it's perfectly maintained I

184
00:06:47,399 --> 00:06:51,519
probably need synthetic and not natural

185
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:54,039
now let's take a look at that in March

186
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:56,079
and April in New York right can it

187
00:06:54,038 --> 00:06:57,399
withstand two hours a day right probably

188
00:06:56,079 --> 00:06:59,639
not and this is the argument for

189
00:06:57,399 --> 00:07:01,279
synthetic especially up here where we

190
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:02,879
have those wet conditions when it is

191
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:04,719
warm enough to play but not warm enough

192
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:06,599
to grow right this is one of the

193
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,879
solutions uh and then maybe one of the

194
00:07:06,598 --> 00:07:10,038
other Solutions and this is where we

195
00:07:07,879 --> 00:07:12,240
bring in in kale today is is maybe you

196
00:07:10,038 --> 00:07:14,680
select different varieties right this is

197
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,079
some research uh in the mid 2000s uh

198
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:18,319
that you guys did with fertilizer

199
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:19,839
timings and then also the the turf

200
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:21,400
varieties and we've certainly seen this

201
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:23,560
over the years right the Kentucky

202
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:25,478
Bluegrass often selected on on Sports

203
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:28,478
Fields but doesn't have that spring

204
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:30,639
green up or the growth um early in the

205
00:07:28,478 --> 00:07:33,038
season there like a perennial Ry grass

206
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:34,800
or a Turf type tall fescue um and you

207
00:07:33,038 --> 00:07:36,918
could see there in the data there's uh

208
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,400
the yield rates over there on the far

209
00:07:36,918 --> 00:07:41,279
right hand corner and basically what you

210
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:43,038
see is April and May the yield the

211
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:44,559
amount the grass is going to grow is

212
00:07:43,038 --> 00:07:47,079
much higher for perennial Ry grass or

213
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:48,199
turf type 12 T Fescue then Kentucky

214
00:07:47,079 --> 00:07:49,918
Bluegrass that means it's going to

215
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:52,079
handle the traffic better right at least

216
00:07:49,918 --> 00:07:53,959
in in the springtime so those are some

217
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:56,079
of the you know the the maybe the

218
00:07:53,959 --> 00:07:58,158
solutions synthetic T's if you got

219
00:07:56,079 --> 00:08:00,918
golfers out there and you don't want to

220
00:07:58,158 --> 00:08:02,319
have divots little mat maybe that helps

221
00:08:00,918 --> 00:08:04,198
on the sports field side if you don't

222
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:06,158
have a synthetic sort of Swing field to

223
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:07,319
to get people to maybe you start

224
00:08:06,158 --> 00:08:09,439
thinking about these these different

225
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:11,280
varieties or fertilizing differently in

226
00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:12,918
the fall and and maybe optimizing that

227
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:14,399
timing and there's some there's some

228
00:08:12,918 --> 00:08:17,359
research on that as

229
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:19,239
well yeah and I'll tell you Carl I had

230
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:22,680
this slide I'm going towards the end of

231
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:25,598
what I was GNA talk about to uh set K up

232
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:28,519
but K and Carl since you brought it up

233
00:08:25,598 --> 00:08:31,598
you know kale we were raised in the sort

234
00:08:28,519 --> 00:08:34,958
of turf grass world with this is how

235
00:08:31,598 --> 00:08:36,360
cool seas and grasses grow right and and

236
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:38,718
I'm and in this case you know we're

237
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:40,879
talking about sort of relative rate of

238
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:43,479
vertical extension and relative rate of

239
00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:45,360
root growth or depth so the deeper The

240
00:08:43,479 --> 00:08:48,000
Roots the more it's growing the taller

241
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:50,080
the pulse above the more it's growing on

242
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,240
the top this is what we were taught and

243
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:55,600
to Carl's Point uh about color and yield

244
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:58,839
and Greenup I don't know if this is

245
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:00,920
actually the same study or not but I

246
00:08:58,839 --> 00:09:04,000
used it in another presentation and kept

247
00:09:00,919 --> 00:09:06,039
the sort of thing on it um but this was

248
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,320
I think some data that you generated as

249
00:09:06,039 --> 00:09:11,639
well where you were collecting clippings

250
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:14,920
and again you see tall fescue and even

251
00:09:11,639 --> 00:09:18,879
Kentucky Bluegrass to be more of a you

252
00:09:14,919 --> 00:09:21,159
know not a multiple pulse of growth but

253
00:09:18,879 --> 00:09:23,799
rather sort of a most of it in the

254
00:09:21,159 --> 00:09:26,078
spring and almost you know relatively

255
00:09:23,799 --> 00:09:28,399
speaking you wouldn't call it a blip in

256
00:09:26,078 --> 00:09:30,838
the Autumn you'd call it more of a blip

257
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:34,120
in the summer if were saying growth was

258
00:09:30,839 --> 00:09:36,040
surging so let's start here with this um

259
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:37,759
can we talk a little bit about what your

260
00:09:36,039 --> 00:09:39,519
observations have been over the years

261
00:09:37,759 --> 00:09:41,480
with t Fescue because I'll get to the

262
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:43,560
weather uh and stuff in a minute but

263
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:45,360
Carl set you up really good here you

264
00:09:43,559 --> 00:09:48,838
want to comment for a second about this

265
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:50,720
work yeah absolutely thanks Carl um you

266
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:52,240
know I think I think you know this this

267
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:55,480
definitely Falls a little bit into that

268
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:57,600
it depends bucket a bit too right and so

269
00:09:55,480 --> 00:10:00,240
that study that uh you highlighted you

270
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:02,320
know that was early in my career here

271
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:04,639
you that's that's a good 20 years ago

272
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:07,760
and we were using improved tall fescues

273
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:09,519
at that time right uh and as you well

274
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:12,600
know over the last 20 years the advances

275
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:14,600
on the tall fescues has been tremendous

276
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:16,000
uh one of the things I think that we saw

277
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:18,839
was you know some of those earlier

278
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,519
generations of of the tall fescues was

279
00:10:18,839 --> 00:10:22,920
they still had some Heritage towards

280
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:25,440
their Forge type friends right and so

281
00:10:22,919 --> 00:10:27,759
you had that that spring pulse that was

282
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:29,760
happening but what I what I also think

283
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:31,799
is important here is the fact that you

284
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:34,439
know you had that growth flush in the

285
00:10:31,799 --> 00:10:37,838
spring but it's also that sustaining of

286
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:39,920
growth into the summer months right um

287
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:42,360
and and I think that a lot of our newer

288
00:10:39,919 --> 00:10:44,078
tall fescues and and again you know the

289
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:46,240
individual that recently graduated with

290
00:10:44,078 --> 00:10:47,519
me Dr Palin doing all her work on the

291
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:49,120
brown patch and everything I mean

292
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:52,480
there's some really good information

293
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:54,399
there but she's about to publish a study

294
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,800
looking at you know Leaf elongation

295
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:58,278
rates and how that affects disease so

296
00:10:56,799 --> 00:11:00,278
it's it's going to be some really

297
00:10:58,278 --> 00:11:02,639
interesting information that'll get into

298
00:11:00,278 --> 00:11:05,000
into the literature but those are these

299
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:06,399
most recent generations of tall fescue

300
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,958
so I think that with you know what

301
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:09,839
you're seeing on that big blip in the

302
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:12,799
spring that's probably going to come

303
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:14,800
down a little bit as far as um you know

304
00:11:12,799 --> 00:11:16,958
the growth rate but the other thing

305
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:18,479
you're seeing and ultimately it comes

306
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:21,199
down to those images you were showing as

307
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:23,680
far as shoot density right and so these

308
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,680
tall fescues or Ry grasses or whatever

309
00:11:23,679 --> 00:11:26,359
you're using as long as you're

310
00:11:24,679 --> 00:11:30,359
maintaining the density that that's

311
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:33,440
probably going to be a good part of this

312
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:35,000
okay um interesting we're going to have

313
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:37,839
you back to talk maybe we're going to

314
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:40,039
get J to talk about that J here she'd be

315
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:42,079
happy to talk about that and and and uh

316
00:11:40,039 --> 00:11:44,039
the brown patch thing because you know

317
00:11:42,078 --> 00:11:47,159
that's this thing about potentially

318
00:11:44,039 --> 00:11:49,319
regulating growth uh I think people have

319
00:11:47,159 --> 00:11:52,000
said this from herbicides and maybe

320
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:55,079
creating problems having a pre- barrier

321
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:57,799
down limiting limiting growth rate um

322
00:11:55,078 --> 00:11:59,519
and I guess the use of whether pgrs do

323
00:11:57,799 --> 00:12:03,479
these things I don't know how much PG Ys

324
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:06,560
we use PA fescue in so let me let me get

325
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:08,639
to let me get back here to the weather

326
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:10,399
and I got some more we got more tall Fue

327
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:13,519
to talk about kale don't don't you worry

328
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:16,519
about that so um the the twoin soil

329
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:19,839
temperature uh back uh three weeks ago

330
00:12:16,519 --> 00:12:22,759
now was barely creeping into the low

331
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:25,120
upper 40s uh low 50s you had to get all

332
00:12:22,759 --> 00:12:26,679
the way down into C's old neck of the

333
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:29,198
woods down to Virginia Tech where you

334
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:31,439
were even making it to 60 degrees three

335
00:12:29,198 --> 00:12:35,120
weeks ago uh but things have it started

336
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:38,199
to advance and just uh last week we were

337
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:41,600
in the you know up you know mid mid 50s

338
00:12:38,198 --> 00:12:44,639
to Mid 60s and you know this week we've

339
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:47,399
seen a little bit of a h sort of moving

340
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:49,198
North to still but the temperatures are

341
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:52,320
sort of holding we're still in the

342
00:12:49,198 --> 00:12:55,159
mid-40s to the north and lows uh the low

343
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:56,760
60s of in the South so it's almost

344
00:12:55,159 --> 00:12:59,399
feeling like we're a little bit further

345
00:12:56,759 --> 00:13:01,399
ahead next week last week you got to

346
00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:02,958
watch the colors with these things for

347
00:13:01,399 --> 00:13:05,198
those of you that use the forecast

348
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:08,159
website make sure you're looking at the

349
00:13:05,198 --> 00:13:10,399
colors uh because sometimes they change

350
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:12,078
uh depending on what you're looking at

351
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:14,519
uh whether it's uh depending on the

352
00:13:12,078 --> 00:13:17,120
scale below so here is temperature

353
00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:19,919
departure uh three weeks ago where we

354
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:21,919
were cooler than normal uh and then you

355
00:13:19,919 --> 00:13:24,719
really started to see a stall that

356
00:13:21,919 --> 00:13:27,278
normal stall we see occur especially

357
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:30,480
along the coast relative to the 30-year

358
00:13:27,278 --> 00:13:33,078
normal and now uh most recently it looks

359
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:35,519
like it's been warm along the lakes and

360
00:13:33,078 --> 00:13:37,719
cooler along the Atlantic coast but

361
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:40,320
certainly a little bit above normal when

362
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:43,839
you get into the Philly uh you know

363
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:46,680
Maryland Virginia delm Marva area it's

364
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:48,720
consistently been wet uh this was a few

365
00:13:46,679 --> 00:13:51,078
weeks ago and now we're seeing it

366
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:54,360
continue to be a little bit wet but more

367
00:13:51,078 --> 00:13:56,479
wet to the west and in fact a lot of uh

368
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:58,800
the western part of this uh region

369
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:01,278
needed that moisture uh we saw that

370
00:13:58,799 --> 00:14:02,799
Thompson yesterday uh came to the walk

371
00:14:01,278 --> 00:14:05,240
and talk from Buffalo and he said we

372
00:14:02,799 --> 00:14:07,719
were dry uh we just got a bunch of rain

373
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:09,639
so we're good for now now I'll just draw

374
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:12,399
attention to one of the uh interesting

375
00:14:09,639 --> 00:14:14,839
tools Carl has built uh for the forecast

376
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:17,839
website looking at uh dandelion and

377
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:20,880
clover flowering this pollinator risk

378
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:24,279
assessment tool and it's projecting out

379
00:14:20,879 --> 00:14:27,799
uh out to April 20th and you can see uh

380
00:14:24,278 --> 00:14:31,039
that the pollinator risk is growing into

381
00:14:27,799 --> 00:14:33,000
Central New Jersey and all the way into

382
00:14:31,039 --> 00:14:35,599
uh the Metropolitan New York area where

383
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:38,480
danion are going to be beginning to

384
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:40,519
flower so you see that the green area is

385
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:44,240
moving out which means the risk is

386
00:14:40,519 --> 00:14:46,759
growing right uh on the on the uh using

387
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:48,879
the old Growing Degree day model for

388
00:14:46,759 --> 00:14:51,039
spring dandelion control that was

389
00:14:48,879 --> 00:14:54,039
developed years ago that we still use

390
00:14:51,039 --> 00:14:56,439
sort of as a marker uh you see that

391
00:14:54,039 --> 00:14:59,719
where it's red in the pollinator risk

392
00:14:56,440 --> 00:15:02,560
assessment to the South you see it green

393
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:05,680
for weed control so while we might

394
00:15:02,559 --> 00:15:08,919
recommend this right we want to be very

395
00:15:05,679 --> 00:15:10,799
careful about the way we manage uh these

396
00:15:08,919 --> 00:15:13,198
herbicide applications when the

397
00:15:10,799 --> 00:15:15,159
pollinator risk is a little bit higher

398
00:15:13,198 --> 00:15:17,879
and that's just a a really important

399
00:15:15,159 --> 00:15:19,719
point to consider um when you're

400
00:15:17,879 --> 00:15:22,439
thinking about using these tools and

401
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:24,040
making any applications to the lawn now

402
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:27,320
moving forward looks like it's going to

403
00:15:24,039 --> 00:15:29,000
be as as art told us this morning a

404
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:31,600
little bit of a carbon copy of the

405
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:35,078
previous week a little warmish and a

406
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:37,720
little wsh uh with sort of the 8 to 14

407
00:15:35,078 --> 00:15:39,958
day bringing us around normal so looks

408
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:42,399
like we might get a little bit of a cool

409
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:45,039
move through in the next few days but

410
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:46,919
otherwise looking pretty good now um The

411
00:15:45,039 --> 00:15:49,000
Growing Degree day differences are very

412
00:15:46,919 --> 00:15:51,039
interesting and and I think this is

413
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:54,039
something that maybe we need to think

414
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:56,240
about changing Carl th this is uh

415
00:15:54,039 --> 00:16:00,000
collecting The Growing Degree Days base

416
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:02,399
50 from March 15 right right so we

417
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:05,000
usually start to think we can start

418
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:08,399
collecting degree days then but we may

419
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:11,000
be accumulating some before then

420
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:14,000
obviously the spring with a very mild

421
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:16,440
winter progresses fairly rapidly but it

422
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:19,159
still indicates we're behind last year's

423
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:22,720
accumulation in that time period and at

424
00:16:19,159 --> 00:16:25,519
or near normal uh except for the most

425
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:28,199
Northeastern areas that are well behind

426
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:29,759
the 30-year normal the Boston area a lot

427
00:16:28,198 --> 00:16:32,599
of massachus

428
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:35,440
uh a little bit in Duchess and uh in the

429
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:37,800
in Orange County so phenological

430
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:39,959
indicators we've been staring at the for

431
00:16:37,799 --> 00:16:41,958
already for a little bit and we use this

432
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:43,599
as a measure of determining crab grass

433
00:16:41,958 --> 00:16:46,078
control right whether we're going to put

434
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:49,040
our pre-emergence down and where kale is

435
00:16:46,078 --> 00:16:51,758
in Southern Indiana they're well along

436
00:16:49,039 --> 00:16:54,958
crab grass germination there we still

437
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:56,879
are on the uh early phases of it but I

438
00:16:54,958 --> 00:16:59,879
would say in the New York metropolitan

439
00:16:56,879 --> 00:17:01,559
area and South uh Now's the Time to get

440
00:16:59,879 --> 00:17:03,278
that pre-emergent down I think the

441
00:17:01,559 --> 00:17:05,879
pre-emergent model was telling you to

442
00:17:03,278 --> 00:17:08,000
put it out maybe even two weeks ago I

443
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:09,520
think we're at that point now where you

444
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,038
probably should get your pre in the

445
00:17:09,519 --> 00:17:13,599
ground uh but you want to watch out for

446
00:17:12,038 --> 00:17:15,000
all the water in the ground I mean we

447
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:16,918
were talking to people this morning

448
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,798
telling us and I've showed pictures

449
00:17:16,919 --> 00:17:20,880
already we've seen pictures that you

450
00:17:18,798 --> 00:17:23,240
make a mess when when you're getting out

451
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:26,120
there trying to work this time of year

452
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:29,079
now Lee Miller a new addition to the

453
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:32,279
Purdue team over the last few years Cal

454
00:17:29,079 --> 00:17:34,839
uh now continues to send out this update

455
00:17:32,279 --> 00:17:37,480
uh you can see like I see the national

456
00:17:34,839 --> 00:17:40,079
phenology network indicating that spring

457
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:43,798
is really coming through very early 20

458
00:17:40,079 --> 00:17:46,960
days in some places uh the FL the foras

459
00:17:43,798 --> 00:17:49,359
are flowering and get along uh you this

460
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:51,360
was a picture I think I used last year

461
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:53,038
you take these lovely pictures roughly

462
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:54,399
from the same spot every time I don't

463
00:17:53,038 --> 00:17:56,519
know if you got a mark on it or

464
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:59,480
something that you keep going back to

465
00:17:56,519 --> 00:18:01,279
roughly the same spot um this was last

466
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:03,279
year and it's been a little bit of up

467
00:18:01,279 --> 00:18:05,200
and down right and this is what I wanted

468
00:18:03,279 --> 00:18:07,279
to turn your attention to and ask you to

469
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:10,400
speculate a little bit we're having

470
00:18:07,279 --> 00:18:13,119
these fall spring right where she warms

471
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:15,320
up and gets going and then you get that

472
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:17,199
dump of snow and we see this in the

473
00:18:15,319 --> 00:18:19,279
literature uh where we've you know

474
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:21,720
adopted this name fall spring you get

475
00:18:19,279 --> 00:18:24,720
this extended warming you get vulnerable

476
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:27,240
plants and it wasn't until Eric Watkins

477
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:29,120
did some of this work with fall Springs

478
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:31,839
and the potential impact that can have

479
00:18:29,119 --> 00:18:34,479
on Turf type tall fescues that I started

480
00:18:31,839 --> 00:18:36,639
to even think that this was problematic

481
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:39,000
so that same stuff that we were just

482
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:41,120
talking about kale let's start here what

483
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,960
are your thoughts about how the tall

484
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:46,639
fescues have evolved away from that

485
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:49,840
forage type I wonder if it's making it

486
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:52,280
more susceptible to this kind of stuff

487
00:18:49,839 --> 00:18:54,759
but i' love to hear your thoughts about

488
00:18:52,279 --> 00:18:57,119
the potential injury that these

489
00:18:54,759 --> 00:18:59,158
persistent fall Springs might have

490
00:18:57,119 --> 00:19:01,439
obviously it doesn't look like one day

491
00:18:59,159 --> 00:19:03,559
is too much problem but you know five

492
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:06,759
days of pretty nasty weather would looks

493
00:19:03,558 --> 00:19:09,119
like it would set the tall fescue back

494
00:19:06,759 --> 00:19:11,158
significantly yeah and you know an

495
00:19:09,119 --> 00:19:12,479
obvious question here Frank would be you

496
00:19:11,159 --> 00:19:15,280
know what was the maturity of these

497
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:16,400
plants right and so you know is it is it

498
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:17,960
the kind of thing that this was

499
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:21,120
something that was seated in September

500
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:23,600
and then subject to this uh you know we

501
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:26,678
we have you know historically here the

502
00:19:23,599 --> 00:19:30,279
last several Falls had that extended

503
00:19:26,679 --> 00:19:32,400
fall with a lot of um warm temperatures

504
00:19:30,279 --> 00:19:33,879
all the way into November and I think

505
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,759
that there's some folks that are still

506
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:37,520
trying to seed at that time of the year

507
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:39,599
by the same token there's individuals

508
00:19:37,519 --> 00:19:42,359
that are seeding in September but we've

509
00:19:39,599 --> 00:19:43,719
had that that warmer fall and drier fall

510
00:19:42,359 --> 00:19:45,599
and if you don't have irrigation and

511
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:47,400
can't get that plant established I I

512
00:19:45,599 --> 00:19:50,359
could easily see this happening uh

513
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:54,120
certainly with with the tall fescues but

514
00:19:50,359 --> 00:19:55,918
um not mature stands not not I I think

515
00:19:54,119 --> 00:19:57,399
the mature stands probably are not going

516
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:59,640
to be as susceptible to what you see

517
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:02,280
there on the far right um we haven't

518
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:04,960
seen as much of that but periodically we

519
00:20:02,279 --> 00:20:06,918
we do my program does a lot of cultivar

520
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:08,720
and species evaluations and and we have

521
00:20:06,919 --> 00:20:12,159
seen some of this uh we saw a little bit

522
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:15,079
on some Ry grass too a couple years ago

523
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:17,880
okay all right so so sometimes so we're

524
00:20:15,079 --> 00:20:22,119
not necessarily when we're mature

525
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:23,520
trading off this potential for D damage

526
00:20:22,119 --> 00:20:25,839
because you know some of one of the

527
00:20:23,519 --> 00:20:27,558
reasons I think annual Bluegrass dies uh

528
00:20:25,839 --> 00:20:29,720
in the springtime is of course it breaks

529
00:20:27,558 --> 00:20:32,200
dorcy and then the temperatures drop

530
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:34,720
hardening uh breaks down and I'm just

531
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:36,720
wondering if this is sort of a Harbinger

532
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:39,319
for things but I know one of the things

533
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:42,319
you've written about for the S Growers

534
00:20:39,319 --> 00:20:45,558
uh particularly uh and even the general

535
00:20:42,319 --> 00:20:48,759
public about hey off Fescue is is maybe

536
00:20:45,558 --> 00:20:51,720
a good companion plant in certain

537
00:20:48,759 --> 00:20:55,240
plantings uh pollinator plantings but

538
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:58,200
but also uh really good for keeping

539
00:20:55,240 --> 00:21:00,400
weeds out when once you get a good stand

540
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:02,080
they tend to be pretty good I know

541
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:04,880
you've talked about and visited this

542
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:06,879
study that Doug's had going on uh out

543
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:09,400
there in Wisconsin for a really long

544
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:11,520
time Doug sold that um can you talk a

545
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:14,798
little bit about sort of your feelings

546
00:21:11,519 --> 00:21:17,400
about let's start with tall fescue as a

547
00:21:14,798 --> 00:21:19,918
sort of pretty good at keeping weeds out

548
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:21,880
even at relatively low fertility and

549
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:24,200
then we'll talk about how it's maybe

550
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:26,559
good companion planting and pollinator

551
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:27,640
things yeah I think I think you know

552
00:21:26,558 --> 00:21:30,000
when you start to think about these

553
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:32,360
lower maintenance la and you know I did

554
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,519
have a chance to visit this site uh last

555
00:21:32,359 --> 00:21:36,000
summer and saw kind of what they have

556
00:21:34,519 --> 00:21:37,639
been doing for a number of years there

557
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,880
at Wisconsin I think that study's good

558
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:42,038
10 years old now as far as these plots

559
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:43,880
and you know you could still see that

560
00:21:42,038 --> 00:21:46,038
that stand of tall fescue that had been

561
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:48,080
planted there especially you know on the

562
00:21:46,038 --> 00:21:50,319
lower maintenance side with you know two

563
00:21:48,079 --> 00:21:52,158
fertilizer applications a year you know

564
00:21:50,319 --> 00:21:54,399
it was really holding stand density

565
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:56,679
quite well and you know I'm I'm giving

566
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:58,600
an exam in about two hours and you know

567
00:21:56,679 --> 00:21:59,840
one of the questions there is you know

568
00:21:58,599 --> 00:22:01,759
how do you minimize you know the

569
00:21:59,839 --> 00:22:03,439
Reliance on pesticides and Lawns and it

570
00:22:01,759 --> 00:22:06,759
comes back to cultivate a dense healthy

571
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:09,159
Turf right and so choosing the right

572
00:22:06,759 --> 00:22:11,278
plant the right place and uh you know

573
00:22:09,159 --> 00:22:13,360
having tall fescue as part of our lawn

574
00:22:11,278 --> 00:22:14,960
you know Blends or mix mixes seems to

575
00:22:13,359 --> 00:22:19,319
make a lot of sense that we we've got a

576
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:21,400
lot of evidence there okay so one of the

577
00:22:19,319 --> 00:22:23,079
knocks I tried to get to the early

578
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:26,159
spring thing I'm trying to break down

579
00:22:23,079 --> 00:22:28,639
some of the push back I get um how

580
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:30,640
worried about because you have much more

581
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:33,480
intense Brown patch pressure you know

582
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:35,919
than we do right you're really in the

583
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:38,640
transition zone for all intents and

584
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:41,200
purposes the line is getting further and

585
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:42,520
further where you're included in it

586
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:45,159
pretty

587
00:22:42,519 --> 00:22:47,558
significantly um all the time now I mean

588
00:22:45,159 --> 00:22:50,320
I think maybe in the past I don't know

589
00:22:47,558 --> 00:22:52,678
but for sure how do you deal with the

590
00:22:50,319 --> 00:22:54,918
potential Brown patch susceptibility in

591
00:22:52,679 --> 00:22:57,480
in the trials maybe that you've seen are

592
00:22:54,919 --> 00:23:00,038
we getting better is it superficial or

593
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:01,278
is do we still got some work to do I

594
00:23:00,038 --> 00:23:03,400
think I think you got a couple things

595
00:23:01,278 --> 00:23:05,200
there so so folks in that southern

596
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:06,640
Indiana the Ohio River Valley that's

597
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:08,400
definitely going to be you know prime

598
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:09,600
time that's probably almost as bad as a

599
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:12,360
place like Raleigh where they're trying

600
00:23:09,599 --> 00:23:14,480
to grow some of the tall fescues uh

601
00:23:12,359 --> 00:23:16,119
there are some nice granular products

602
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:18,839
you know the ones that have the aoxy

603
00:23:16,119 --> 00:23:20,678
strobin those are those are you know

604
00:23:18,839 --> 00:23:22,639
almost a gold standard as far as you

605
00:23:20,679 --> 00:23:24,480
know suppression of brown patching still

606
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,960
comes back to timing of that fungicide

607
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:27,319
you know so from the lawn care side

608
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:29,000
there are some granular products that

609
00:23:27,319 --> 00:23:31,240
are highly effective

610
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:33,679
um but in addition to that and again I

611
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:35,278
strongly encourage you know Dragon Jada

612
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:38,080
onto this show to have her talk about

613
00:23:35,278 --> 00:23:40,440
her her stuff she did for her PhD but

614
00:23:38,079 --> 00:23:42,278
you know the the range of susceptibility

615
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:44,679
on the cultivars I mean there are some

616
00:23:42,278 --> 00:23:46,200
that are really highly resistant now and

617
00:23:44,679 --> 00:23:49,120
so choosing those highly resistant

618
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:50,880
cultivars including them in a blend uh

619
00:23:49,119 --> 00:23:53,239
or you know one of the other things that

620
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:56,440
she and I have kicked around is is can

621
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:59,200
you intercede or overseed that Superior

622
00:23:56,440 --> 00:24:01,120
cultivar into an existing turf to try

623
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:02,640
and change some of the species Dynamics

624
00:24:01,119 --> 00:24:05,079
and I I genuinely think that's a

625
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:07,840
potential option for some of these lawn

626
00:24:05,079 --> 00:24:09,759
situations okay so couple of things here

627
00:24:07,839 --> 00:24:11,480
thank you for bringing that up you've

628
00:24:09,759 --> 00:24:14,599
obviously looked at this a little bit

629
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:16,839
right and if we took all your work which

630
00:24:14,599 --> 00:24:19,240
has been substantial now not just with

631
00:24:16,839 --> 00:24:20,798
Jada but other students have come and

632
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:24,200
you've been evaluating these things for

633
00:24:20,798 --> 00:24:26,319
EP for years now and one of the cells

634
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:28,080
when I got here to the Northeast 28

635
00:24:26,319 --> 00:24:29,960
years ago after being in the Midwest for

636
00:24:28,079 --> 00:24:32,199
a while when I got back here to the

637
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:33,278
Northeast and I I brought tall fescue

638
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:35,759
with me because I'm like man these

639
00:24:33,278 --> 00:24:37,240
things look really good here we go and

640
00:24:35,759 --> 00:24:39,398
by the way it's looks like it's going to

641
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:41,480
get drier here in the summer now it's

642
00:24:39,398 --> 00:24:45,599
not been very dry actually the last

643
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:47,480
several years but in general I like the

644
00:24:45,599 --> 00:24:49,398
fact that if you gave tall fescue a

645
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:50,919
halfway decent chance to put some Roots

646
00:24:49,398 --> 00:24:53,000
down it was going to root

647
00:24:50,919 --> 00:24:55,038
pound-for-pound deeper than just about

648
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:57,880
everything else you could find and that

649
00:24:55,038 --> 00:24:59,720
rooting is where the resilience lies so

650
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:00,720
let's talk a little bit start with a

651
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:04,880
couple of

652
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:07,480
things what would do you like a Turf

653
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:11,919
type tall fescue s that's

654
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:15,399
9010 with the blue grass there as a good

655
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:17,000
solid uh approach to establishing

656
00:25:15,398 --> 00:25:21,678
generally assuming you got the right

657
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:23,359
place do you like that or are you still

658
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:27,038
okay with just put the S and then

659
00:25:23,359 --> 00:25:27,038
intercede the tall fescue

660
00:25:27,159 --> 00:25:31,600
in uh um you know that's a really good

661
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:33,240
question and I've been I've been uh you

662
00:25:31,599 --> 00:25:35,000
talking to some of these developers

663
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:36,519
recently because I think in some

664
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,599
situations you know some of these new

665
00:25:36,519 --> 00:25:40,319
communities they're mandating sing the

666
00:25:38,599 --> 00:25:41,959
front Lawns right you know this this

667
00:25:40,319 --> 00:25:43,200
company comes in they buy the land they

668
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:45,200
put in you know the three or four

669
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:46,759
bedroom house and you know it's about

670
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:48,840
having sort of the eight the homeowners

671
00:25:46,759 --> 00:25:51,158
association do their thing and

672
00:25:48,839 --> 00:25:53,398
unfortunately a lot of times the sod

673
00:25:51,159 --> 00:25:55,640
growers locally a lot of them just only

674
00:25:53,398 --> 00:25:58,719
have the Kentucky blueg grasses but I

675
00:25:55,640 --> 00:26:01,480
think interceding into that existing

676
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:04,079
into that existing lawn is an option

677
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:07,360
it's actually more of an option than I

678
00:26:04,079 --> 00:26:09,918
uh had expected but if if some of these

679
00:26:07,359 --> 00:26:12,639
developers can interact with aad Growers

680
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:15,080
and ask for some of these tall Fest use

681
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:18,038
as aade that's one way to go I'd almost

682
00:26:15,079 --> 00:26:19,639
rather see that see you start with that

683
00:26:18,038 --> 00:26:21,960
okay so wait now you're bringing up a

684
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:23,679
better point because it sound like you

685
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:25,720
were not hopeful that you were going to

686
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:28,640
get much establishment from interceding

687
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:30,759
tall fescue in because we get a lot of

688
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:33,559
people come with the lawn from hell

689
00:26:30,759 --> 00:26:36,798
right I gotta fix this thing and I'm

690
00:26:33,558 --> 00:26:39,038
wondering if what you think is toescu is

691
00:26:36,798 --> 00:26:41,879
just good to stitch into any cool season

692
00:26:39,038 --> 00:26:43,919
grass lawn to maybe make it more

693
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:46,320
resilient but I worry a little bit about

694
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:47,960
the clumpiness of that is that part of

695
00:26:46,319 --> 00:26:50,119
the reason you didn't think interceding

696
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:52,038
was going to be successful and maybe it

697
00:26:50,119 --> 00:26:54,278
didn't get as clumpy as you thought what

698
00:26:52,038 --> 00:26:56,119
do you think I think I think some of it

699
00:26:54,278 --> 00:26:57,519
mindset you know was going way back to

700
00:26:56,119 --> 00:26:59,158
even some I think some of the work that

701
00:26:57,519 --> 00:27:00,599
you might have done and Dan Bowman had

702
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:02,679
done trying to interseed those bent

703
00:27:00,599 --> 00:27:04,839
grasses into into putting greens right

704
00:27:02,679 --> 00:27:06,798
and trying to improve cultivars that way

705
00:27:04,839 --> 00:27:08,599
and my mindset and frame a reference

706
00:27:06,798 --> 00:27:10,599
from that was that you know it's a

707
00:27:08,599 --> 00:27:12,240
numbers game and the exist the existing

708
00:27:10,599 --> 00:27:15,278
big bullies of grasses are going to

709
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:16,399
crowd out any seedlings um but that's a

710
00:27:15,278 --> 00:27:17,759
different system right I mean that

711
00:27:16,398 --> 00:27:19,479
putting green is a way different system

712
00:27:17,759 --> 00:27:21,558
than this lawn situation especially if

713
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:23,399
you're doing some fall seatings in those

714
00:27:21,558 --> 00:27:25,639
mowing intervals suddenly stretch from

715
00:27:23,398 --> 00:27:27,519
being you know seven days to 14 days and

716
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:28,759
giving those those seedlings a potential

717
00:27:27,519 --> 00:27:31,000
opportunity

718
00:27:28,759 --> 00:27:33,759
uh to establish in there but your point

719
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:36,359
about the clumpiness uh that is a

720
00:27:33,759 --> 00:27:38,119
possibility I mean that is a possibility

721
00:27:36,359 --> 00:27:40,519
um especially if you're doing a 10,000

722
00:27:38,119 --> 00:27:42,558
square foot lawn uh but if you if you

723
00:27:40,519 --> 00:27:44,558
commit to a two or three year type of

724
00:27:42,558 --> 00:27:46,599
process I think maybe that's less of an

725
00:27:44,558 --> 00:27:48,639
issue one and done okay you're probably

726
00:27:46,599 --> 00:27:50,000
GNA see some clumpiness potential

727
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:52,480
clumpiness right one more thing before

728
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:55,200
we turn it over for questions and that's

729
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:58,679
the water issue that I've got up here um

730
00:27:55,200 --> 00:28:02,679
would you I mean this TF fescue

731
00:27:58,679 --> 00:28:05,798
I assume will hold up longer with uh

732
00:28:02,679 --> 00:28:08,278
less water than it than a Bluegrass will

733
00:28:05,798 --> 00:28:10,158
but I've also learned that Blu grasses

734
00:28:08,278 --> 00:28:13,919
don't sell them short there's a lot of

735
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:16,278
good Blu grasses that can still hold up

736
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:17,519
what is your feeling about uh you know

737
00:28:16,278 --> 00:28:19,000
because I see the blueg grass is

738
00:28:17,519 --> 00:28:20,880
improving and we can leave the Prov

739
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,880
Vista technology out for now but I see

740
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:24,600
the blueg grass is improving I still

741
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:28,200
wonder what your thoughts are is tall

742
00:28:24,599 --> 00:28:30,759
fescue pound-for-pound still a better

743
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:32,960
manager of drought conditions than

744
00:28:30,759 --> 00:28:35,440
bluegrass well and it kind of comes back

745
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:37,798
to Consumer mindset and so like this

746
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:39,519
study we had to kind of settle on

747
00:28:37,798 --> 00:28:42,200
something and and you know you see there

748
00:28:39,519 --> 00:28:44,558
we had 70% you know digital green color

749
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:47,000
is what we were working with is that

750
00:28:44,558 --> 00:28:48,639
point where you know the the lawn owner

751
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,839
is going to try and flip on the

752
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:53,960
irrigation system or or do something of

753
00:28:50,839 --> 00:28:56,319
of that nature uh in if this is the the

754
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:58,679
right study I think what was really cool

755
00:28:56,319 --> 00:29:01,200
about this was our bluegrasses

756
00:28:58,679 --> 00:29:04,360
they were hitting that 70% green cover

757
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:07,798
somewhere around 18 days the tall fesu

758
00:29:04,359 --> 00:29:10,000
were closer to like 40 42 days before

759
00:29:07,798 --> 00:29:12,519
without any irrigation they're hanging

760
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:15,720
on staying green for 40 that's over a

761
00:29:12,519 --> 00:29:17,519
month that's that's crazy talk right

762
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:19,558
yeah that's right and that's and that's

763
00:29:17,519 --> 00:29:21,720
the perfect yeah that's that's exactly

764
00:29:19,558 --> 00:29:23,158
what I was hoping to hear you say

765
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:25,360
because we've seen this pretty

766
00:29:23,159 --> 00:29:27,159
consistently that if the consumer

767
00:29:25,359 --> 00:29:29,719
mindset says I'm not worrying about this

768
00:29:27,159 --> 00:29:33,240
thing until it's 7 % you know that's

769
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:34,640
only 70% greed that changes the game for

770
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:36,359
us because I think one of the problems

771
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:40,240
is we've assumed everything's got to be

772
00:29:36,359 --> 00:29:42,558
dark blue green completely Weed Free and

773
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:44,720
I think now the consumer mindset is

774
00:29:42,558 --> 00:29:46,879
changing and what do you think Carl

775
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:49,000
we're at the we're at the hour here

776
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:52,679
we're at our our fastest 30 minutes went

777
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:54,240
by in 32 minutes so what do you like uh

778
00:29:52,679 --> 00:29:56,360
what do you like for a question or a

779
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:58,200
comment before we wrap up yeah I think

780
00:29:56,359 --> 00:29:59,678
Vitas has a good question and speaking

781
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:01,759
to sort of the application in sports

782
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:03,399
turf field so Frank I know when you got

783
00:30:01,759 --> 00:30:04,558
here to Corell you thought man T Fescue

784
00:30:03,398 --> 00:30:07,239
we should be using this for athletic

785
00:30:04,558 --> 00:30:09,200
fields and uh people have concerns about

786
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:12,159
its wear tolerance does it get thin and

787
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:15,038
can it spread so Vitas is asking does it

788
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:16,919
have any laterally spreading ability can

789
00:30:15,038 --> 00:30:19,158
it hold up there or do you need to to

790
00:30:16,919 --> 00:30:20,960
intercede pretty pretty frequently uh to

791
00:30:19,159 --> 00:30:24,519
sort of account for that where tolerance

792
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:27,000
it's for you okay let me take that one

793
00:30:24,519 --> 00:30:29,558
I'm gonna let you tell me if T Fescue

794
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:32,000
has risoles

795
00:30:29,558 --> 00:30:34,000
um well as we both know and we've all

796
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:36,798
seen the marketing information is there

797
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,599
are some that are weakly Romus right and

798
00:30:36,798 --> 00:30:40,639
and so they they do spread out and

799
00:30:38,599 --> 00:30:42,398
that's been documented uh that they do

800
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:44,600
spread but they they're not as

801
00:30:42,398 --> 00:30:46,479
aggressive as say you know one of these

802
00:30:44,599 --> 00:30:47,839
these improved Kentucky bluegrasses

803
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:49,880
that's used on some of these Athletic

804
00:30:47,839 --> 00:30:52,119
Field mixes I mean they're just those

805
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:54,720
are really aggressive but they also are

806
00:30:52,119 --> 00:30:57,319
higher thatch formers too right so you

807
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:58,919
know you're trading things off sometimes

808
00:30:57,319 --> 00:31:00,319
uh the other thing on the athletic field

809
00:30:58,919 --> 00:31:02,960
side with the tall fesk is where I think

810
00:31:00,319 --> 00:31:04,678
there's a little bit of um Market

811
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:07,558
confusion is that you can't take them

812
00:31:04,679 --> 00:31:09,480
down in cutting height right uh we just

813
00:31:07,558 --> 00:31:10,918
actually published another paper uh

814
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:13,200
Jaden and I published another paper

815
00:31:10,919 --> 00:31:15,600
looking at potential Fairway grasses

816
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:17,720
right and so one of the rock stars in

817
00:31:15,599 --> 00:31:19,359
that paper was we had some Turf type

818
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:22,880
tall fescue at a half an inch in our

819
00:31:19,359 --> 00:31:25,240
rain out shelter for multiple years so

820
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:27,278
this idea that maybe on say middle

821
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:28,839
school or something like that where they

822
00:31:27,278 --> 00:31:30,599
want to maintain a field at an inch and

823
00:31:28,839 --> 00:31:33,119
a half I think our tall fescues are

824
00:31:30,599 --> 00:31:35,158
probably a reasonable or something in an

825
00:31:33,119 --> 00:31:36,798
athletic field mix tall fescue Bluegrass

826
00:31:35,159 --> 00:31:38,600
mix at an inch and a half I bet you

827
00:31:36,798 --> 00:31:41,359
could do it pretty

828
00:31:38,599 --> 00:31:42,558
well wow that's very that's really

829
00:31:41,359 --> 00:31:44,398
fascinating because I would worry a

830
00:31:42,558 --> 00:31:46,798
little bit about the canopy opening up I

831
00:31:44,398 --> 00:31:48,479
can't wait is that already out we gota

832
00:31:46,798 --> 00:31:50,638
yeah we that about a year ago I'll send

833
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:52,399
it to you and Carl good yeah beautiful

834
00:31:50,638 --> 00:31:55,519
beautiful what what else Carl we gotta

835
00:31:52,398 --> 00:31:57,119
get him out of here one more so generous

836
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:58,599
yeah and I remember kale last last time

837
00:31:57,119 --> 00:32:00,839
we had you on we talked about the micro

838
00:31:58,599 --> 00:32:03,079
Clover mixes and Rich I remember sent me

839
00:32:00,839 --> 00:32:05,720
Rich Bradley out and and Cape Cod sent

840
00:32:03,079 --> 00:32:08,879
me a mix he had 90% Turf type tall

841
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:11,200
fescue and 10% Clover he said it got

842
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:13,720
taken over by the Clover like crazy so

843
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:15,038
he said the sight's 5050 sun shade I

844
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:16,639
remember asking him hey did you not

845
00:32:15,038 --> 00:32:19,759
fertilize it he's like no fertilize it

846
00:32:16,638 --> 00:32:21,638
so that's not the issue uh thinks he got

847
00:32:19,759 --> 00:32:23,919
too much water there also got brown

848
00:32:21,638 --> 00:32:27,000
patch any thoughts on on sort of what

849
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:28,799
happened uh it could be all over the map

850
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:31,119
right you know even when we've dealt

851
00:32:28,798 --> 00:32:34,119
with the microc clovers here going back

852
00:32:31,119 --> 00:32:35,359
to that patchiness Frank uh I think with

853
00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:37,000
those people that are dealing with those

854
00:32:35,359 --> 00:32:39,119
clovers there's the potential for that

855
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:41,398
patchiness to develop in in those

856
00:32:39,119 --> 00:32:42,959
systems but the clovers I think there's

857
00:32:41,398 --> 00:32:44,558
a lot we need to learn about the clovers

858
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:46,480
everything from pests you know disease

859
00:32:44,558 --> 00:32:49,000
and insect pests that could cause it to

860
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:50,759
fail but at the same time the right

861
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,960
conditions like you said sort of cooler

862
00:32:50,759 --> 00:32:57,879
and wetter and that Clover can just it's

863
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:59,480
a viny weed so it could it could move y

864
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:01,320
well uh well let's wrap it up there for

865
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:04,480
we got we could go all over the place

866
00:33:01,319 --> 00:33:05,879
it's funny 70% dgci last year we're

867
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:08,319
we're measuring that out our plots I'm

868
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:09,320
like I like 60 like I don't mind 60 yeah
