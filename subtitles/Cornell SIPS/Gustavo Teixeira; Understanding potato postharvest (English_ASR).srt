1
00:00:00,599 --> 00:00:04,240
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:07,559 --> 00:00:11,960
University please let me know if you

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,759
have any difficulty in understanding me

4
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:16,400
because you know I have a really strong

5
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:18,679
Brazilian accent and not to help I went

6
00:00:16,399 --> 00:00:21,079
to Australia know to know to get a

7
00:00:18,679 --> 00:00:23,359
better English you know I I probably I

8
00:00:21,079 --> 00:00:25,759
should have gone to New Zealand you know

9
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:28,480
to get a better English but you know I

10
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:30,920
have this a strong Brazilian Australian

11
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:33,159
accent so

12
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:35,160
first of all i' would like to thank Dr

13
00:00:33,159 --> 00:00:37,839
alopi for the invitation for me is a

14
00:00:35,159 --> 00:00:41,799
great honor to be here today giving this

15
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:44,600
presentation as dropi told you i' I came

16
00:00:41,799 --> 00:00:47,799
here in 2015 as a visiting Professor

17
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:50,920
with a G Watkins Dr G Watkins and I

18
00:00:47,799 --> 00:00:52,640
actually loved Cornell not just for the

19
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:54,480
scientific interaction that I had but

20
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:57,799
also it was

21
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:59,238
summer no and was beautiful I loveed the

22
00:00:57,799 --> 00:01:00,878
campus and but and then I was just

23
00:00:59,238 --> 00:01:04,158
wondering how is is this campus during

24
00:01:00,878 --> 00:01:06,759
the winter and here I am 9 years now

25
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:11,719
later here at the campus and it's still

26
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:13,520
beautiful I love it okay um ex do shopi

27
00:01:11,719 --> 00:01:16,239
also

28
00:01:13,519 --> 00:01:19,879
mentioned I was a professor in Brazil I

29
00:01:16,239 --> 00:01:22,560
had never ever worked with potatoes

30
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:25,959
before I was a I was a post Harvest

31
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:27,879
physiology work with mangos bananas a

32
00:01:25,959 --> 00:01:30,280
pineapples and I think the University of

33
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:32,478
Idaho was crazy enough to hire me

34
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:34,320
disposition and then the title of my

35
00:01:32,478 --> 00:01:37,640
presentation is pretty much what I'm

36
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:40,199
experiencing so I'm still understanding

37
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:44,879
potato PSE Harvest and I'm bringing that

38
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:47,399
to you so today I'm I will give you the

39
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:51,319
glimpse of understanding potato post

40
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:55,478
Harvest okay and let's start with a a

41
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:55,478
question so why potatoes are so

42
00:01:56,239 --> 00:02:01,718
special first of all because they are

43
00:01:58,478 --> 00:02:03,239
yummy and very versatile you know many

44
00:02:01,718 --> 00:02:06,839
people like

45
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:08,878
potato and by the way

46
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:12,239
the potatoes

47
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:16,120
USA said that the for the last two

48
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:19,200
years the Americans uh rated potato at

49
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:22,360
the most preferred vegetables that they

50
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:23,399
can have as a food choice and the second

51
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:26,360
one is

52
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:28,599
broccoli you know I think it's a really

53
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:30,480
you know easy race you know if you

54
00:02:28,598 --> 00:02:33,238
compete with broccoli I think everything

55
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:36,560
is going to be good you know but anyway

56
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:39,039
potato is now the leading the most

57
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:42,158
perfect a food in the United States in

58
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:44,959
vegetables and potatoes are so really

59
00:02:42,158 --> 00:02:47,199
nutritious if you think about potato uh

60
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:49,640
people just think about a carbohydrate

61
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:52,079
as a source of energy but potatoes also

62
00:02:49,639 --> 00:02:55,199
is really is a good source of protein

63
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:57,319
and as a good source of potassium when

64
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:59,439
and if you go to the gym people eat a

65
00:02:57,318 --> 00:03:01,958
lot of bananas because bananas is rich

66
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:04,719
in potassium but potatoes are some some

67
00:03:01,959 --> 00:03:07,799
of VAR are richer in pot in potassium

68
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:09,759
than bananas and the same as Vitamin C

69
00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:13,080
we have a lot of vitamin C and

70
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:14,719
potatoes a and also there's a

71
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:19,120
fight

72
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:22,759
a between the industry and the health

73
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:26,158
people uh in terms of ping potato are

74
00:03:22,759 --> 00:03:30,120
not as a vegetable or or is a healthy

75
00:03:26,158 --> 00:03:33,359
food and one of the achievements of the

76
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:36,438
potato a Idaho Potato commission was to

77
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:39,720
be able to put potatoes as a as a good

78
00:03:36,438 --> 00:03:42,680
food for the diabetic Society now we

79
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:44,840
have this label and then so potatoes are

80
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:45,840
good is a good food not not just yummy

81
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,680
but a good

82
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:50,519
food

83
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:53,480
right potato is also economically

84
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:55,840
important so China is the the the the

85
00:03:53,479 --> 00:03:58,479
largest producer in of potatoes in the

86
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:01,000
world but China produces a lot because

87
00:03:58,479 --> 00:04:03,238
they have to feed 1. 5 billion people

88
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,560
and India is the same so the US is the

89
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:10,200
fifth largest producer of potatoes in

90
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:13,199
the world and Idaho is the leading State

91
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:16,519
Idaho produces 35% of potatoes in in the

92
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:17,599
United States then we have a Washington

93
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:22,160
state with

94
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:24,560
27% then we have a Wiscosin and Oregon

95
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:27,720
so the Tri State so Idaho washingon in

96
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:31,120
Oregon produces

97
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:32,800
67% of the potatoes in the United States

98
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:35,120
so it's a lot of potatoes that we

99
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:39,520
produced in the in that the tri-state

100
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:39,519
area but how about New

101
00:04:41,079 --> 00:04:47,519
York okay here we

102
00:04:43,478 --> 00:04:52,439
go the new the upstate New York produced

103
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:55,038
roughly 200,000 tons of potatoes in 2022

104
00:04:52,439 --> 00:04:56,160
that's an industry ofer approximately

105
00:04:55,038 --> 00:04:58,918
$50

106
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,120
million okay it's important industry for

107
00:04:58,918 --> 00:05:03,959
the state

108
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:06,240
good and Cornell plays a vital role for

109
00:05:03,959 --> 00:05:08,439
the potato industry in the in New York

110
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,639
in New York not just releasing new

111
00:05:08,439 --> 00:05:13,560
varieties I just visit the lab with

112
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:17,519
neaty Dr W was marvelous to see all the

113
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:20,478
research that's been Carri out and Dr

114
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:23,519
joh also doing a research with potatoes

115
00:05:20,478 --> 00:05:26,478
uh I I know I know him by name I think I

116
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:29,318
met him in some of paa I'm I'm pretty

117
00:05:26,478 --> 00:05:33,000
good in in in in in faces but I'm pretty

118
00:05:29,319 --> 00:05:34,439
bad names but you know I think I met him

119
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,079
but you know although potatoes are

120
00:05:34,439 --> 00:05:38,439
really important not just nutritionally

121
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:39,879
speaking but economically speaking take

122
00:05:38,439 --> 00:05:44,959
a look at the

123
00:05:39,879 --> 00:05:48,478
losses so FAO report that say say that

124
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:52,000
in the world we're still losing

125
00:05:48,478 --> 00:05:54,318
45% of all roots and a

126
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,399
tubers if you're taking CH the race just

127
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:59,800
in North America oceia like Australia

128
00:05:56,399 --> 00:06:02,758
New Zealand it represents 1 billion bags

129
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:07,439
of potatoes it's a

130
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:09,759
lot it's a lot so it's good for us as a

131
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:12,918
potato plus harest no we still have a

132
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:14,319
lot of room to improve and a lot of work

133
00:06:12,918 --> 00:06:18,038
to be

134
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:20,400
done uh the losses are mostly due to

135
00:06:18,038 --> 00:06:23,000
disease that's a picture of my colleague

136
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:24,879
Dr Nora Olsen she took that she works a

137
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,478
lot with pathology I don't work with

138
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:30,519
pathology and then that would be another

139
00:06:27,478 --> 00:06:32,279
seminar just to talk about a a the

140
00:06:30,519 --> 00:06:35,079
pathological problems of potatoes doing

141
00:06:32,279 --> 00:06:38,439
storage is huge I'm going to talk more

142
00:06:35,079 --> 00:06:40,598
the physiological aspects of a potatoes

143
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:43,079
in storage

144
00:06:40,598 --> 00:06:45,319
good so that's a quick overview about

145
00:06:43,079 --> 00:06:50,279
potatoes so now we're going to move to a

146
00:06:45,319 --> 00:06:52,199
PO Harvest and in Brazil when I when I

147
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:56,679
taught all these different crops like

148
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:58,400
bananas mangoes I always start for the

149
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:01,240
origin

150
00:06:58,399 --> 00:07:04,399
why because you need to understand from

151
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:05,918
where that crop came from and then you

152
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:08,359
can understand all the horiculture

153
00:07:05,918 --> 00:07:11,279
practice that you can

154
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:14,598
apply I cannot grow mangoes in

155
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:17,119
Tropicals I actually I do we grow potato

156
00:07:14,598 --> 00:07:19,680
apples in in in Brazil in the High

157
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:22,000
Altitude but it's really difficult

158
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:24,519
because because it's not the climate we

159
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:29,959
can use a lot of chemicals Etc but it's

160
00:07:24,519 --> 00:07:34,279
hard so a a bananas are apples

161
00:07:29,959 --> 00:07:36,519
are from tropical a from temporate zones

162
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:38,198
and potatoes are also from the temporate

163
00:07:36,519 --> 00:07:41,598
zones from the andies in the South

164
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:43,319
America so they they develop in the high

165
00:07:41,598 --> 00:07:45,839
altitudes for the

166
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:48,120
temperate zones in South America there

167
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:50,918
are a lot of the different varieties

168
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:54,038
types colors shapes so it's a it's a

169
00:07:50,918 --> 00:07:56,399
huge diversity but the Spanish they took

170
00:07:54,038 --> 00:07:58,839
just a small portion of this variety of

171
00:07:56,399 --> 00:08:01,719
diversity and introduced in Europe and

172
00:07:58,839 --> 00:08:03,478
from Europe to the UK and from the UK to

173
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:05,639
the United States in other parts of of

174
00:08:03,478 --> 00:08:07,878
the world but the most important thing

175
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:08,759
of understanding the origin is to

176
00:08:07,879 --> 00:08:12,360
understand the

177
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:16,240
climate I don't know if you can see well

178
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:19,038
this graph a that's a climatological a a

179
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:21,519
information from Cusco in Peru then you

180
00:08:19,038 --> 00:08:24,000
have the mon here in the XX and the

181
00:08:21,519 --> 00:08:25,680
precipitation is the black line and the

182
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,158
temperatures the highest temp

183
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:30,439
temperatures the the orange bars and the

184
00:08:28,158 --> 00:08:32,799
lowest temperatures the gray

185
00:08:30,439 --> 00:08:35,360
bars and you have to take into

186
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:37,000
consideration that the seasons in the

187
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:40,800
South hemisphere is the opposite from

188
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:42,519
here so right now it's winter here and

189
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:45,278
it's Carnival in

190
00:08:42,519 --> 00:08:47,879
Brazil what am I doing here so it's

191
00:08:45,278 --> 00:08:49,759
summer and Carnival and actually my

192
00:08:47,879 --> 00:08:52,600
brother is sending me pictures of you

193
00:08:49,759 --> 00:08:54,439
know he is no dancing in the carnival he

194
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:58,000
loves Carnival

195
00:08:54,440 --> 00:09:00,519
anyway so we have spring when the crop

196
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,000
starts to develop

197
00:09:00,519 --> 00:09:05,679
why the such develop industry and when

198
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,600
we plant potatoes also in the us because

199
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:09,599
we have a increasing precipitation and

200
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:12,959
the minimum temperature starts to

201
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:15,320
rise then potatoes are be able to grow

202
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:18,078
and then we have the

203
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:21,440
summer the crop will grow develop the

204
00:09:18,078 --> 00:09:23,519
canopy and we have a the start of the

205
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:26,519
the reduction in precipitation and also

206
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:27,360
the reduction in the day lamp and they

207
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:30,200
have the

208
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:31,759
terization and the plant will sess

209
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:34,720
during the

210
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:38,159
Autumn less water the temperatures will

211
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:41,278
go down the Plant will sess and

212
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:42,958
eventually in the winter the tubers will

213
00:09:41,278 --> 00:09:48,039
be in the

214
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:50,559
ground dormant they cannot grow why

215
00:09:48,039 --> 00:09:53,958
because it's cold and there is no

216
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:55,599
water that is exactly where we Harvest

217
00:09:53,958 --> 00:09:58,359
potatoes they are

218
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:01,560
dormant so potatoes we have to think

219
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:04,240
that we are just just animals that

220
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:06,719
eat a fruit and vegetables to the

221
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:09,039
disperse know the

222
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:11,800
seeds potatoes were not meant to be

223
00:10:09,039 --> 00:10:13,120
eaten potatoes were meant to reproduce

224
00:10:11,799 --> 00:10:19,719
the

225
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:22,360
plant okay good and then I like this a a

226
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:25,079
classical a chart about

227
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:27,440
development and the H cultural maturity

228
00:10:25,078 --> 00:10:30,679
so that was published by Wata is Cooper

229
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:33,279
in 1984 it's classical

230
00:10:30,679 --> 00:10:36,278
information if you look at the tubers

231
00:10:33,278 --> 00:10:39,399
and and root and Roots you can see that

232
00:10:36,278 --> 00:10:41,838
they have to be harvested at the

233
00:10:39,399 --> 00:10:45,720
physiological maturity state I'm going

234
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:48,480
to explain that okay so many crops for

235
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:51,920
example if you go to browser CR you're

236
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:54,920
going to harvest then at the maturity

237
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:57,199
stage a they are all immature in the

238
00:10:54,919 --> 00:11:00,479
growth but potatoes not they're

239
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:02,360
physiological mature

240
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:04,519
and this is how the potato potatoes

241
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:08,560
develop we plant the seed potatoes then

242
00:11:04,519 --> 00:11:12,959
we meet the stem this stem will grow

243
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:15,799
forming the canopy of the plant and some

244
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:19,000
stems will develop in the

245
00:11:15,799 --> 00:11:19,000
ground the

246
00:11:19,278 --> 00:11:27,639
stolin and this stolin they will

247
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:29,839
accumulate a lot of starch forming the

248
00:11:27,639 --> 00:11:33,120
tubers so

249
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:37,959
basically potatoes when we eat potatoes

250
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:41,159
we are eating a stem or a branch of a

251
00:11:37,958 --> 00:11:43,039
tree that accumulates the start so this

252
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:47,199
is a

253
00:11:43,039 --> 00:11:49,519
branch of a tree we have the bud epical

254
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:52,320
bud we have the leaves and scars with

255
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:54,759
the buds we have many eyes with the buds

256
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:56,720
we have the Len cells we have multiple

257
00:11:54,759 --> 00:11:59,399
Len cells in the

258
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:02,959
potatoes the only difference is that

259
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:04,600
front developed in the ground okay then

260
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:07,199
is a picture just to show all the parts

261
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:08,519
of potato so we have the very same parts

262
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:11,879
of a

263
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:11,879
br and then

264
00:12:12,919 --> 00:12:19,159
maturity I told you

265
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:23,440
that potatoes will develop and then when

266
00:12:19,159 --> 00:12:27,879
start to reach the alt the PLS will sess

267
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:29,720
and the tubers will be ready to be

268
00:12:27,879 --> 00:12:32,320
harvested

269
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:34,240
do you think it's easy to determine the

270
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:36,399
maturity of

271
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,720
potatoes it's really hard because you

272
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:40,198
can't

273
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:43,278
see when seen an apple turning from

274
00:12:40,198 --> 00:12:45,639
green to gray to Red is pretty easy a

275
00:12:43,278 --> 00:12:48,120
mango from green to Yellow is pretty

276
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:50,759
easy you can look at them and say okay

277
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:52,959
that's it's turning it's getting mature

278
00:12:50,759 --> 00:12:56,159
I can Harvest that how about

279
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:59,278
potatoes oh Gustavo

280
00:12:56,159 --> 00:13:01,278
this not all varieties some VAR they

281
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:04,360
keep they are really vigorous they still

282
00:13:01,278 --> 00:13:07,198
have really green canopy so some people

283
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:09,759
are developing like drones and try to

284
00:13:07,198 --> 00:13:13,078
have satellite images and imagery and

285
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:15,198
try to get neur maturity determination

286
00:13:13,078 --> 00:13:17,838
is really complicated because it depends

287
00:13:15,198 --> 00:13:19,319
on not just variety but you have a lot

288
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:20,839
of nitrogen what's going to happen with

289
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:24,079
the

290
00:13:20,839 --> 00:13:26,000
kopy you will be braing but the tubers

291
00:13:24,078 --> 00:13:29,159
are already

292
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,519
mature okay then you have a lot of

293
00:13:29,159 --> 00:13:33,360
maturity

294
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:36,120
indexes some of them are related to the

295
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:38,639
quality for the industry spe especially

296
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:40,959
specific gravity that's related to the

297
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:45,039
content of dry metal in the

298
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:46,319
tuber and the desirable tuber size for

299
00:13:45,039 --> 00:13:49,679
example if you're are growing a

300
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:51,959
specialty potatoes you as a grower you

301
00:13:49,679 --> 00:13:54,399
want a small

302
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:56,719
tuber you don't want a big tuber for

303
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:58,519
specialty potatoes but on the other hand

304
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:00,480
for the industry you have potatoes this

305
00:13:58,519 --> 00:14:03,560
big

306
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:06,039
so and Y is really important and the

307
00:14:03,559 --> 00:14:08,399
sence of the canopy some varieties and

308
00:14:06,039 --> 00:14:12,719
in some conditions and the thickening of

309
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:15,120
the skin that is called Skin set so just

310
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:17,440
to illustrate how that develops in the

311
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:20,720
in the in the field so we have the days

312
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:23,480
after planting specific gravity and

313
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:26,240
reducing sugars so take a look at how

314
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:29,560
the gravity increases over time when it

315
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:30,399
reaches the desire the desired number

316
00:14:29,559 --> 00:14:34,638
that's

317
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:37,958
1.08 we can get the one indication of

318
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:40,759
the maturity the same with sugars the

319
00:14:37,958 --> 00:14:43,359
industry doesn't like a potatoes with a

320
00:14:40,759 --> 00:14:46,320
high content of sugars because when we

321
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:50,399
put in the the fryer having my AR

322
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:54,720
reaction we turn do okay so all these

323
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:57,919
numbers together together a we can

324
00:14:54,720 --> 00:15:00,240
establish the physiological maturity as

325
00:14:57,919 --> 00:15:02,639
expected we have differences in

326
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:05,519
varieties the differences in the maximum

327
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:07,680
yield the maximum specific gravity the

328
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:10,078
minimum suos or the minimum sugar

329
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:13,039
contents if you get all these numbers

330
00:15:10,078 --> 00:15:17,838
and you add and divide it by four that's

331
00:15:13,039 --> 00:15:21,639
the physiological maturity this magical

332
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:24,279
number but in general this is the best

333
00:15:21,639 --> 00:15:26,240
indicator of a Acuity is the

334
00:15:24,278 --> 00:15:31,519
accumulation of degre

335
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:35,278
days um above 4 Celsius

336
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:37,480
or 39 fahit so that's the accumulation

337
00:15:35,278 --> 00:15:40,519
that during the season that's the better

338
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:42,959
prediction predictor of a physiological

339
00:15:40,519 --> 00:15:45,560
maturity and why physiological mat

340
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:45,559
maturity is

341
00:15:46,039 --> 00:15:51,639
important because as any other

342
00:15:49,078 --> 00:15:53,519
crop potatoes are really susceptible to

343
00:15:51,639 --> 00:15:55,360
the the varieties of of the differences

344
00:15:53,519 --> 00:16:00,600
in the environment in temperature

345
00:15:55,360 --> 00:16:03,800
especially temperatures and in higher

346
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:07,519
temperatures the tuor will be

347
00:16:03,799 --> 00:16:09,599
physiologically mature or older I have

348
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:12,959
one student in Brazil and she's doing

349
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:17,120
her PhD and one of

350
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:19,919
her one of her experiments a she went to

351
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:23,318
the grower four hours away she spent the

352
00:16:19,919 --> 00:16:26,198
whole day a har you know digging getting

353
00:16:23,318 --> 00:16:30,278
potatoes when she arrived at the lab the

354
00:16:26,198 --> 00:16:33,559
tubers were already sprouted

355
00:16:30,278 --> 00:16:36,919
why no we are in Brazil we don't have

356
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:39,278
you know cold weather so when potatoes

357
00:16:36,919 --> 00:16:41,479
are exposed to higher temperatures

358
00:16:39,278 --> 00:16:42,360
during the growth period they're going

359
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:45,319
to get

360
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:47,639
older and why is that important because

361
00:16:45,318 --> 00:16:51,639
older potatoes or physiologically older

362
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:54,360
potatoes do have shortened shelf

363
00:16:51,639 --> 00:16:59,799
lives and I love this this

364
00:16:54,360 --> 00:17:01,919
trial a it a it was a a study published

365
00:16:59,799 --> 00:17:04,480
by zic and co-authors in

366
00:17:01,919 --> 00:17:07,480
2014 just to illustrate how temperature

367
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:10,640
can influence physiologically

368
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:14,959
physiologic phys the physiology of the

369
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:18,439
tuber in the in the field the guy so the

370
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:20,600
aler put a lot of a

371
00:17:18,439 --> 00:17:23,679
a

372
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:26,399
resistance in the

373
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:28,919
hill to increase the temperature at

374
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:32,000
different periods of the tuber

375
00:17:28,919 --> 00:17:35,440
development especially after during

376
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:37,720
bulking bulking or at the end of tuber

377
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:41,480
bulking and increase the temperatures

378
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:45,558
over here to 29 c in relation to the the

379
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:49,038
the environment that was 16° C so what's

380
00:17:45,558 --> 00:17:49,038
happening take a look at what's

381
00:17:49,558 --> 00:17:56,839
happening 29c at maturation for Ranger

382
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:59,440
Russell take a look at this

383
00:17:56,839 --> 00:18:02,519
Sprout compared to the the

384
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:05,400
ambient just to illustrate that what my

385
00:18:02,519 --> 00:18:07,798
student faced in Brazil if you have

386
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:10,159
higher temperature in the boat that's

387
00:18:07,798 --> 00:18:11,839
what you're going to have older potatoes

388
00:18:10,159 --> 00:18:14,799
and short shelf

389
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:17,839
life good the another indicator that's a

390
00:18:14,798 --> 00:18:21,079
skin set so skin set is really important

391
00:18:17,839 --> 00:18:24,759
and it usually develops well after three

392
00:18:21,079 --> 00:18:27,720
weeks a after three weeks of Vine CU so

393
00:18:24,759 --> 00:18:30,158
the Growers they have the the the crop

394
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:32,440
and then they spray the crop with a a

395
00:18:30,159 --> 00:18:35,480
herbicide or other product to kill the

396
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:37,880
vine so the vine kill then after three

397
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:39,079
month 3 weeks they can harvest the PE

398
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:42,320
will be well

399
00:18:39,079 --> 00:18:45,599
developed but how about in

400
00:18:42,319 --> 00:18:47,918
Canada three weeks in Canada is too

401
00:18:45,599 --> 00:18:50,759
much in Canada they don't have the

402
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:52,240
luxury of waiting three weeks sometimes

403
00:18:50,759 --> 00:18:55,000
they they harvest potatoes that's a

404
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:57,960
green potatoes they still have the vine

405
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,880
green because the season so so is too

406
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:01,519
short

407
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:04,480
they cannot wait 3 weeks 3 weeks they

408
00:19:01,519 --> 00:19:07,359
will be frozen in the ground and then

409
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:10,759
it's a big problem especially because

410
00:19:07,359 --> 00:19:13,558
immature tubes of a poor skin set will

411
00:19:10,759 --> 00:19:14,839
lead to more disease more dehydration

412
00:19:13,558 --> 00:19:19,240
and more

413
00:19:14,839 --> 00:19:21,480
defect good so this part I covered the

414
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:24,480
physiology that's now I'm going to go to

415
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:25,319
the funny part let say Harvest and food

416
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:30,079
in the

417
00:19:25,319 --> 00:19:32,599
storage so Harvest potatoes are not easy

418
00:19:30,079 --> 00:19:35,038
you know my students she needed to dug

419
00:19:32,599 --> 00:19:37,240
all the potatoes for her trial and there

420
00:19:35,038 --> 00:19:39,879
always is a balance I just showed you so

421
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:44,000
this balance of maturity that we need to

422
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:46,760
go an adequate gravity a low respiration

423
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:49,558
rate when they are mature a adequate

424
00:19:46,759 --> 00:19:52,480
skin set low weight loss and the

425
00:19:49,558 --> 00:19:56,240
opposite when they are

426
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:59,319
immature and how to harvest potatoes I'm

427
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:02,599
not going to cover every single one one

428
00:19:59,319 --> 00:20:04,240
but it's just to show you that you have

429
00:20:02,599 --> 00:20:08,319
multiple

430
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:10,599
steps that can lead to Mechanical injury

431
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:12,759
why because potatoes in in many parts of

432
00:20:10,599 --> 00:20:16,000
the world the commercial production are

433
00:20:12,759 --> 00:20:17,839
harvested using mechanical Harvesters

434
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:21,240
and to illustrate that I brought this

435
00:20:17,839 --> 00:20:25,639
video I hope it works

436
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:28,200
yeah from a big farm in Idaho this water

437
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:32,440
farm from Japanese descendant family

438
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:36,759
take a look at the size of the farms in

439
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:37,600
Idaho we have a digger or more than

440
00:20:36,759 --> 00:20:40,440
eight

441
00:20:37,599 --> 00:20:42,759
rows taking potatoes out of the ground

442
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:45,720
take a look at these and the

443
00:20:42,759 --> 00:20:48,279
possibilities of mechanical injuries in

444
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:51,200
there sorry for the sound but you know I

445
00:20:48,279 --> 00:20:53,879
could not take this out and we have the

446
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:57,120
Harvester that no collects the the the

447
00:20:53,880 --> 00:21:00,400
tub from the ground put in the

448
00:20:57,119 --> 00:21:00,399
truck so the

449
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:07,280
pets

450
00:21:02,919 --> 00:21:11,159
again take a look have to go all around

451
00:21:07,279 --> 00:21:11,158
and follow into the

452
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:30,799
truck and then this truck will take the

453
00:21:26,919 --> 00:21:32,360
potatoes today to the seller we just say

454
00:21:30,798 --> 00:21:34,319
call seller because in the past you used

455
00:21:32,359 --> 00:21:35,240
to store potatoes actually in the seller

456
00:21:34,319 --> 00:21:38,558
of the

457
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:39,839
house take a look the the size of the

458
00:21:38,558 --> 00:21:43,119
the

459
00:21:39,839 --> 00:21:46,720
farm here we go so we have the the the

460
00:21:43,119 --> 00:21:49,199
potato load in the truck they cover the

461
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:52,440
the potatoes with a a a a sheet that's

462
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:53,480
really good to avoid the heat load from

463
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:56,640
the

464
00:21:53,480 --> 00:22:00,038
sunshine and it goes to

465
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:00,038
the the

466
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:04,798
we have some people here sorting the

467
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:08,278
potatoes and also taking the dust out

468
00:22:04,798 --> 00:22:08,278
and they go into the the

469
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:14,919
storage just to show the many steps that

470
00:22:12,839 --> 00:22:17,720
we

471
00:22:14,919 --> 00:22:20,000
have and they can feel one of these big

472
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:25,159
cellers in one

473
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:25,159
day take a look at the the amount of

474
00:22:26,319 --> 00:22:32,278
potato have the ventilation system here

475
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:35,200
so this is

476
00:22:32,278 --> 00:22:38,240
amazing it's amazing how they can

477
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:40,679
manage all the farm the logistic is

478
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:43,519
involved and then it's not surprised

479
00:22:40,679 --> 00:22:46,400
that we have a lot of mechanical damage

480
00:22:43,519 --> 00:22:50,359
so knows and co-authors publish that the

481
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:56,400
70% happens during the Harvest it's a

482
00:22:50,359 --> 00:23:00,839
lot 14% at a truck the pile of 14% And

483
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:03,880
here very low 2% but all this a

484
00:23:00,839 --> 00:23:05,240
mechanical damage will result in death

485
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:07,919
really poor

486
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:09,880
quality and the PO quality is not just

487
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:13,600
related to the bruising itself but also

488
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:16,480
the skinny that's all all opening a

489
00:23:13,599 --> 00:23:20,399
openings that can lead to more weight

490
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:22,839
loss and the entry of a path pathogen

491
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:24,519
and have a shadow bruise and mechanical

492
00:23:22,839 --> 00:23:27,519
Dam like internal black

493
00:23:24,519 --> 00:23:31,038
spot and all this blackening is due to a

494
00:23:27,519 --> 00:23:33,720
enzy called polyphenol oxidase we also

495
00:23:31,038 --> 00:23:36,519
have know when you have a

496
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:39,000
scratch it doesn't turn

497
00:23:36,519 --> 00:23:42,679
black it's the same enzyme it's doing

498
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:45,839
the same job oxidizing the monophenols

499
00:23:42,679 --> 00:23:48,640
in dienols but they still colorless they

500
00:23:45,839 --> 00:23:51,480
don't have color and the D phos in or

501
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:54,400
quos that are a little bit yellowish

502
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:56,599
color but they are really reactive

503
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:58,960
compounds why they are reactive

504
00:23:56,599 --> 00:24:01,480
compounds because the plant produces

505
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:04,640
that to protect the plant against the

506
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:06,839
pathogens so this compound will react

507
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:08,159
with the amino acids and proteins from

508
00:24:06,839 --> 00:24:12,798
the

509
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:14,559
pathogens okay but uh in that case we

510
00:24:12,798 --> 00:24:17,079
react with the amino acid and protein

511
00:24:14,558 --> 00:24:20,240
leading to dark polymers that the

512
00:24:17,079 --> 00:24:23,240
industry doesn't like and the industry

513
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:24,640
doesn't like to the point to develop a

514
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:29,480
silenced

515
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:32,399
po a potato that is a a

516
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:34,120
a potato that was released by Simplot

517
00:24:32,398 --> 00:24:36,398
one of the largest companies in in the

518
00:24:34,119 --> 00:24:39,798
United States so that's a take a look at

519
00:24:36,398 --> 00:24:44,639
the difference between a one potato

520
00:24:39,798 --> 00:24:48,038
without the p with P5 and without P5

521
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:51,360
equality so there's no Brown they also

522
00:24:48,038 --> 00:24:53,200
developed that the silen Asar synthes A1

523
00:24:51,359 --> 00:24:56,879
Gene there's

524
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:59,038
noide a synthesis so it is a toxic

525
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:02,399
compound the only thing that I don't

526
00:24:59,038 --> 00:25:05,839
like in that is a as a as a post Harvest

527
00:25:02,398 --> 00:25:10,000
physiologist we never can

528
00:25:05,839 --> 00:25:13,599
forget all the the vi the Via Cress that

529
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:16,278
the potato passed from the field to go

530
00:25:13,599 --> 00:25:19,240
to the storage the multiple steps of

531
00:25:16,278 --> 00:25:20,278
mechanical damage so it's not because

532
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:23,558
it's not

533
00:25:20,278 --> 00:25:26,240
showing the brown that they are not

534
00:25:23,558 --> 00:25:28,119
suffering mechanical damages because

535
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:31,519
this mechanical damage can also affect

536
00:25:28,119 --> 00:25:35,558
all the quality aspects of potatoes

537
00:25:31,519 --> 00:25:38,278
okay now CH storage

538
00:25:35,558 --> 00:25:40,119
so there are multiple steps in the

539
00:25:38,278 --> 00:25:42,720
storage I'm not going to cover all of

540
00:25:40,119 --> 00:25:46,000
them I'm going to jump into directly to

541
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:48,079
the co the curing because I showed you

542
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:51,079
one picture of the the potato with a a

543
00:25:48,079 --> 00:25:53,480
lot of skinny problem that's due to

544
00:25:51,079 --> 00:25:57,199
abrasion when they are moving from the

545
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:59,558
the the ground to the to the cell and

546
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:02,919
the Cur is really important esec

547
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:05,639
especially to produce a new layer of a

548
00:26:02,919 --> 00:26:09,480
periderm and protect the potatoes from

549
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:09,480
disease and dissocation

550
00:26:09,519 --> 00:26:15,359
okay and I'm going to follow all this

551
00:26:12,398 --> 00:26:18,479
recommendations from a no from

552
00:26:15,359 --> 00:26:21,839
Washington State University about curing

553
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:26,200
so what is curing Cur is not exclusive

554
00:26:21,839 --> 00:26:28,359
from for potatoes so onions and garlic

555
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:30,679
we have the curing

556
00:26:28,359 --> 00:26:32,439
a process in the post Harvest you need

557
00:26:30,679 --> 00:26:36,880
to dry out this problem and develop a

558
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:40,240
new skin to protect against pathogens

559
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:45,200
okay so what is wound healing

560
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:48,038
so we have the the sound peel of potato

561
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:51,120
we have a subis layer subepidermal cells

562
00:26:48,038 --> 00:26:55,359
and cortical cells when it's damaged

563
00:26:51,119 --> 00:26:58,359
potatoes do do have a a really nice

564
00:26:55,359 --> 00:27:02,798
capacity of producing new

565
00:26:58,359 --> 00:27:04,639
a perm a a layer of cells due to this

566
00:27:02,798 --> 00:27:06,960
dep position of

567
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:10,240
subin if you cut potatoes and let in

568
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:11,600
your table in four days you have a new

569
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:14,399
SK on

570
00:27:11,599 --> 00:27:16,119
top so many other crops do have that

571
00:27:14,398 --> 00:27:19,038
like sweet potatoes for example they

572
00:27:16,119 --> 00:27:21,639
also have curing and it's a three-step

573
00:27:19,038 --> 00:27:24,440
process we have initial one that takes

574
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:25,840
plac in 0 to 36 hours have the

575
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:28,840
solarization that takes a little bit

576
00:27:25,839 --> 00:27:32,918
longer and also the wood the W be their

577
00:27:28,839 --> 00:27:36,439
information in terms of a the initial

578
00:27:32,919 --> 00:27:38,240
response uh is really interesting so we

579
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:41,558
have the the damaged

580
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:45,120
cells and the damaged cells will produce

581
00:27:41,558 --> 00:27:46,759
what we called damage Associated

582
00:27:45,119 --> 00:27:50,239
molecular

583
00:27:46,759 --> 00:27:53,038
patterns especially a oxygen reactive

584
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:56,240
species and the release of

585
00:27:53,038 --> 00:27:58,278
calcium so the the reactive oxygen

586
00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:01,519
species and calcium are will be

587
00:27:58,278 --> 00:28:05,919
responsible for sealing off the plasma

588
00:28:01,519 --> 00:28:08,240
desmas not leaving the the pathogens to

589
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:12,080
getting the adjacent

590
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:15,359
cell so protecting that sound cell and

591
00:28:12,079 --> 00:28:19,319
also the calcium will

592
00:28:15,359 --> 00:28:22,079
move through the other the cells

593
00:28:19,319 --> 00:28:23,960
and initiating the Cascade of

594
00:28:22,079 --> 00:28:27,639
phosphorilation that will lead to the

595
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:30,278
transcription of defensive a a defense

596
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:33,120
genes to protect the sound

597
00:28:30,278 --> 00:28:36,599
cells but you know it's not that

598
00:28:33,119 --> 00:28:38,359
complicated I love this paper uh what is

599
00:28:36,599 --> 00:28:42,558
really important is to understand the

600
00:28:38,359 --> 00:28:45,599
role of the reactive oxygen species es

601
00:28:42,558 --> 00:28:50,079
especially a the oxidase this

602
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:53,038
NPH oxidase that has a pick in 24

603
00:28:50,079 --> 00:28:56,398
hours what what this enzyme does this

604
00:28:53,038 --> 00:29:00,278
enzyme produces super

605
00:28:56,398 --> 00:29:02,918
oxide super oxide have a super oxide

606
00:29:00,278 --> 00:29:06,679
dismutase that will convert this super

607
00:29:02,919 --> 00:29:07,919
oxide into hydrogen peroxidase and

608
00:29:06,679 --> 00:29:10,559
hydrogen

609
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:12,640
peroxidase uh is a substrate of

610
00:29:10,558 --> 00:29:17,798
peroxidase that will oxidize the

611
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:20,720
phenolic compounds into a a subar it's

612
00:29:17,798 --> 00:29:21,519
not that complicated come on and leading

613
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:23,798
to the

614
00:29:21,519 --> 00:29:25,640
suberization and suberization is a

615
00:29:23,798 --> 00:29:27,839
process of forming that new layer of

616
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:31,240
subin in the damage cells

617
00:29:27,839 --> 00:29:35,199
okay and if you look at this

618
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:37,599
time you can see that is

619
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:40,600
extremely dependent

620
00:29:37,599 --> 00:29:40,599
on

621
00:29:40,798 --> 00:29:46,480
temperature what's the rule of Tomy post

622
00:29:43,119 --> 00:29:49,479
Harvest cool as soon as you

623
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:51,960
can not with

624
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:53,919
potatoes because if you cool potatoes

625
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:55,679
really quickly we're going to affect the

626
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:58,000
wound healing and it's going to take

627
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:59,559
longer take a look

628
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:02,798
so we need to keep a the a little bit

629
00:29:59,558 --> 00:30:04,398
warm for this process to take place and

630
00:30:02,798 --> 00:30:06,519
another enzyme that's really important

631
00:30:04,398 --> 00:30:11,479
in that in that part is

632
00:30:06,519 --> 00:30:13,000
the or as in United

633
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:15,798
States

634
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:19,200
Li uh so this enzyme is responsible for

635
00:30:15,798 --> 00:30:22,558
converting the amino acid penine into

636
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:25,240
trinamic acid okay and then the

637
00:30:22,558 --> 00:30:29,119
accumulation of a trinamic

638
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:32,399
acid with a not activity producing

639
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:35,398
superoxide a hydrogen peroxide and the

640
00:30:32,398 --> 00:30:38,479
wall associate peroxidase forming this

641
00:30:35,398 --> 00:30:41,359
the the subar that will be that will

642
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:43,679
lead to the accumulation of subar in the

643
00:30:41,359 --> 00:30:47,319
new per there

644
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:49,559
okay and finally is the the the

645
00:30:47,319 --> 00:30:53,839
differentiation of the new cells that

646
00:30:49,558 --> 00:30:56,240
also is dependent on temperature so it's

647
00:30:53,839 --> 00:30:57,879
always a tradeoff

648
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:00,519
between

649
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:03,120
the temperature and the physiological

650
00:31:00,519 --> 00:31:05,759
process that you

651
00:31:03,119 --> 00:31:08,158
want if it's the highest the temperature

652
00:31:05,759 --> 00:31:11,038
the faster is going to be the C the

653
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:13,559
curing but at higher temperature what

654
00:31:11,038 --> 00:31:16,919
you going to have a higher probability

655
00:31:13,558 --> 00:31:20,879
of disease development and weight

656
00:31:16,919 --> 00:31:24,960
loss if you we if we C that down we're

657
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:27,840
going to slow the curing process control

658
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:31,399
the the the K development

659
00:31:27,839 --> 00:31:35,839
and reduce the weight loss but with a

660
00:31:31,398 --> 00:31:39,359
cust in the process okay just to show

661
00:31:35,839 --> 00:31:42,519
they you know how the W new wound bird

662
00:31:39,359 --> 00:31:45,439
will form using a different a DI you can

663
00:31:42,519 --> 00:31:49,120
see that a

664
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:54,639
microsof okay let's go to cing in the

665
00:31:49,119 --> 00:31:57,839
Pacific Northwest we use a the vapora ti

666
00:31:54,638 --> 00:32:00,240
Cooling in the majority of the store

667
00:31:57,839 --> 00:32:03,720
we don't very

668
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:05,038
few potato storage do have mechanical a

669
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:08,038
refrigeration

670
00:32:05,038 --> 00:32:10,079
system some do have especially when they

671
00:32:08,038 --> 00:32:14,200
harvest potatoes in August they still

672
00:32:10,079 --> 00:32:18,000
really warm have a huge heat load do you

673
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:19,840
imagine one of those a storage full of

674
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:24,240
potatoes at

675
00:32:19,839 --> 00:32:27,240
68 degrees fhe it's a huge heat load

676
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:29,240
inside that building so thetive to

677
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:32,278
doesn't have the capacity of remove all

678
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:35,319
that heat no they have a supplementary a

679
00:32:32,278 --> 00:32:38,200
mechanical unit or you can actually a

680
00:32:35,319 --> 00:32:40,240
lease a a mechanical refrigeration

681
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:43,480
system and put in your system to try to

682
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:45,079
cool potatoes down okay the most

683
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:47,759
important part of the evaporative

684
00:32:45,079 --> 00:32:50,398
cooling is

685
00:32:47,759 --> 00:32:53,519
this relative

686
00:32:50,398 --> 00:33:00,038
humidity potatoes

687
00:32:53,519 --> 00:33:01,919
always it must be stored at 97% relative

688
00:33:00,038 --> 00:33:04,398
otherwise you're going to lose a lot of

689
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:08,639
weight and weight is

690
00:33:04,398 --> 00:33:12,839
money water is money PO is 80% water if

691
00:33:08,638 --> 00:33:16,240
you lose water you lose money okay and

692
00:33:12,839 --> 00:33:19,038
ventilation is the is the is the way

693
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:21,359
that is used in the industry they talk a

694
00:33:19,038 --> 00:33:23,240
lot a lot about ventilation oh

695
00:33:21,359 --> 00:33:25,479
ventilation is really important but

696
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:28,359
ventilation in my my perspective is just

697
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:31,599
a way to p down the

698
00:33:28,359 --> 00:33:33,319
props we cannot use hydrocooling if I

699
00:33:31,599 --> 00:33:35,839
could use hydrocooling I would talk

700
00:33:33,319 --> 00:33:38,558
about the water I'm not talking about

701
00:33:35,839 --> 00:33:42,759
water I'm talking about air air movement

702
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:45,720
is ventilation and the main the two main

703
00:33:42,759 --> 00:33:49,398
systems we have a like a the pipes that

704
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:50,798
are put on in the bottom of the cell and

705
00:33:49,398 --> 00:33:52,158
you have also the concrete with

706
00:33:50,798 --> 00:33:54,918
perorations

707
00:33:52,159 --> 00:34:00,000
that I go

708
00:33:54,919 --> 00:34:03,038
down yep so have this this a structures

709
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:06,240
here we have the planet the air is blown

710
00:34:03,038 --> 00:34:09,199
from my side to the end and get they get

711
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:12,239
in this a

712
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:14,960
holes and they leave from from here to

713
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:14,959
the top of the

714
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:23,159
CR and the thing

715
00:34:18,679 --> 00:34:27,320
is we have 18 ft of potatoes for this

716
00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:31,440
air to move so we have the capacity of

717
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:34,320
the the the the VAP cooling is huge to

718
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:36,760
be able to have the enough air to move

719
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:39,800
through the scrub and remove the the the

720
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:44,760
moist and also the temperature

721
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:47,119
okay um so whenever the cool the the

722
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:50,839
curing period is

723
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:54,039
over we need to cool that crop really

724
00:34:50,838 --> 00:34:56,838
quickly to the holding temperature so

725
00:34:54,039 --> 00:34:59,639
it's usually done by you know reducing

726
00:34:56,838 --> 00:35:04,400
using the temperature 4

727
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:05,759
25.5 de F per week so it takes longer if

728
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:10,639
you imagine that the you're going to

729
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:13,760
move from 50 to 55 to 42 it takes almost

730
00:35:10,639 --> 00:35:16,358
one month to reach that temperature it's

731
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:18,680
a h is a long period that potatoes will

732
00:35:16,358 --> 00:35:21,239
be exposed to higher temperature and the

733
00:35:18,679 --> 00:35:23,118
possibility of losing a lot of weight

734
00:35:21,239 --> 00:35:24,719
then the ventilation takes place here

735
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:27,000
that's really important because if you

736
00:35:24,719 --> 00:35:30,199
have a higher ventilation right we can

737
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:33,039
cool that crop really quickly but and

738
00:35:30,199 --> 00:35:34,519
the most important part again is to keep

739
00:35:33,039 --> 00:35:37,440
that high

740
00:35:34,519 --> 00:35:40,079
moisture High relative humidity because

741
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:42,838
take a look at the it's not the the

742
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:46,359
speed of the air that will lead to the

743
00:35:42,838 --> 00:35:50,039
weight loss it's actually the relative

744
00:35:46,358 --> 00:35:54,559
humidity in that air that will drive the

745
00:35:50,039 --> 00:35:55,800
weight loss so at 99% take a look potato

746
00:35:54,559 --> 00:35:57,639
actually get

747
00:35:55,800 --> 00:36:00,760
weight

748
00:35:57,639 --> 00:36:02,639
in 97 that's the recommended you you're

749
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:06,280
not you're not going to lose weight even

750
00:36:02,639 --> 00:36:09,838
though we have a huge air flow here and

751
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:11,960
90 take a look so that's the relative

752
00:36:09,838 --> 00:36:13,318
that drives the weight loss and not just

753
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:16,480
the ventilation

754
00:36:13,318 --> 00:36:18,318
itself okay let's go to holding holding

755
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:21,240
is the temperature that we keep potatoes

756
00:36:18,318 --> 00:36:23,559
for 8 to 12

757
00:36:21,239 --> 00:36:26,318
months and potatoes are not different

758
00:36:23,559 --> 00:36:28,239
from the other crops so the the higher

759
00:36:26,318 --> 00:36:31,318
the temperature the shorter is going to

760
00:36:28,239 --> 00:36:33,919
be the Shelf line or on the or we can

761
00:36:31,318 --> 00:36:36,960
say the lower the temperature the longer

762
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:40,480
is going to be the Shelf FL for potatoes

763
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:42,119
okay that's exponential relationship as

764
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:43,960
many other

765
00:36:42,119 --> 00:36:46,559
props but

766
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:50,920
potatoes always Happ it's a complicated

767
00:36:46,559 --> 00:36:53,159
problem there's a problem that's called

768
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:55,440
sweetening so what is called

769
00:36:53,159 --> 00:36:59,199
sweetening who likes

770
00:36:55,440 --> 00:37:00,400
barbecue I'm from Brazil I love B and I

771
00:36:59,199 --> 00:37:04,719
and I love

772
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:08,000
beer so what I do I get my my my my

773
00:37:04,719 --> 00:37:11,279
cooler I put the ice water and

774
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:16,119
salt why I put the

775
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:19,040
salt to reduce the freezing

776
00:37:16,119 --> 00:37:20,920
point so it's going to be below zero and

777
00:37:19,039 --> 00:37:23,358
it keeps my beer

778
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:25,599
cooler potatoes do the

779
00:37:23,358 --> 00:37:30,159
same we have the

780
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:33,280
cell if I put the cell in the lower

781
00:37:30,159 --> 00:37:36,039
temperature as an adaptation potatoes

782
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:38,640
will hydroly the

783
00:37:36,039 --> 00:37:41,039
star

784
00:37:38,639 --> 00:37:44,199
producing glucose and

785
00:37:41,039 --> 00:37:47,599
fructose increasing their osmolarity of

786
00:37:44,199 --> 00:37:49,318
the cell protecting the cell from

787
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:52,440
freezing or

788
00:37:49,318 --> 00:37:54,679
cooling is an adaptation do you remember

789
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:57,400
the first one of the first slides that I

790
00:37:54,679 --> 00:38:00,399
showed you origin the tub is on the

791
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:03,039
ground in the ground during the

792
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:05,280
winter that's an adapation to survive

793
00:38:03,039 --> 00:38:08,199
the winter to be able to to germinate

794
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:12,519
during the Spring but is pretty bad for

795
00:38:08,199 --> 00:38:16,679
the industry why because this reducing

796
00:38:12,519 --> 00:38:19,719
sugars when we fry potatoes again in

797
00:38:16,679 --> 00:38:22,480
when they at higher temperature have my

798
00:38:19,719 --> 00:38:25,919
my reaction so the reducing sugars will

799
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:29,358
react with amino acids producing melano

800
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:35,400
that are d pigments and also can produce

801
00:38:29,358 --> 00:38:35,400
aamine that's a toxic compound so that's

802
00:38:35,679 --> 00:38:40,519
why the temperatures for the holding

803
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:44,240
period

804
00:38:40,519 --> 00:38:46,759
varies according to the end use for

805
00:38:44,239 --> 00:38:48,799
example for table potato or or fresh

806
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:51,079
potatoes that we eat now we buy in the

807
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:53,280
supermarket to make Smash Potatoes I'm

808
00:38:51,079 --> 00:38:57,640
going to cook uh we don't have this

809
00:38:53,280 --> 00:39:01,359
problem we can put potatoes at below 45

810
00:38:57,639 --> 00:39:04,199
actually some grows put at 39 40 fhe and

811
00:39:01,358 --> 00:39:06,559
for frying we should keep these potatoes

812
00:39:04,199 --> 00:39:09,358
at higher temperature because we need to

813
00:39:06,559 --> 00:39:11,119
avoid that cooling the cooling Sweet

814
00:39:09,358 --> 00:39:15,440
Cooling sweet

815
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:17,880
Mo and uh for chips is even worse so

816
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:20,159
depending on end and use you have

817
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:23,160
different temperatures so what why

818
00:39:20,159 --> 00:39:25,078
because consumers don't

819
00:39:23,159 --> 00:39:28,440
like

820
00:39:25,079 --> 00:39:28,440
dark French

821
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:36,039
fries I don't I don't care I know I can

822
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:37,000
eat B french fries but McDonald's for

823
00:39:36,039 --> 00:39:41,000
example

824
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:42,079
wants just USDA number zeros that's

825
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:46,318
really

826
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:50,000
pay potato so the whiter the

827
00:39:46,318 --> 00:39:53,159
better okay just to simplify here a some

828
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:56,400
a trios at

829
00:39:53,159 --> 00:39:58,559
Theo Tina brand she now she works for

830
00:39:56,400 --> 00:40:01,119
for SE plot but she did the say she

831
00:39:58,559 --> 00:40:02,960
worked for the invest of for many years

832
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:06,760
and then we have here two different for

833
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:09,240
artists rber bank that is standard in

834
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:12,680
for the industry and Clear Water rusted

835
00:40:09,239 --> 00:40:15,358
now is a a also approved by McDonald's

836
00:40:12,679 --> 00:40:18,719
just to show how they react uh during

837
00:40:15,358 --> 00:40:21,559
the storage so we use three mostly three

838
00:40:18,719 --> 00:40:24,118
temperatures 32 45

839
00:40:21,559 --> 00:40:27,000
48 and take a look that's the limit of

840
00:40:24,119 --> 00:40:30,000
sugars .1% glucose

841
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:33,599
take a look at Burbank at

842
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:37,159
42 during the holding

843
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:40,400
period all above the threshold just at

844
00:40:37,159 --> 00:40:41,920
48 was pretty much know at the limit but

845
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:44,559
take a look at Clear

846
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:47,000
Water so that's why the industry is

847
00:40:44,559 --> 00:40:49,199
moving so they called cold resistant

848
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:51,800
varieties so they don't have this

849
00:40:49,199 --> 00:40:54,039
increase in sugars during the storage

850
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:57,640
and in terms of reflectance that's the

851
00:40:54,039 --> 00:41:02,318
color of a the fried so we have used the

852
00:40:57,639 --> 00:41:05,159
USDA a chart let's consider USDA Zer 1 2

853
00:41:02,318 --> 00:41:08,000
3 and four take a look at a clear waters

854
00:41:05,159 --> 00:41:09,719
they all the chips all the fries were

855
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:13,000
above a

856
00:41:09,719 --> 00:41:17,118
one and I'll take a look at the the

857
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:19,318
russer bir bags so just to show that a

858
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:21,480
the quality can change according to the

859
00:41:19,318 --> 00:41:23,920
varieties and also the temperature that

860
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:25,280
we use to store potatoes so that's

861
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:28,280
really good when you have like in a

862
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:30,920
reading program post Harvest program

863
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:33,040
working together because that's a we

864
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:35,119
need to determine the end use of that

865
00:41:33,039 --> 00:41:38,199
variety that can be really good in terms

866
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:38,880
of eeld but you know cannot store well

867
00:41:38,199 --> 00:41:42,039
at

868
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:45,079
42 should be stored at 48 to keep the

869
00:41:42,039 --> 00:41:46,800
sugars below the threshold in the color

870
00:41:45,079 --> 00:41:49,400
as a good

871
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:54,280
power there are some

872
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:57,599
remedies but they're not 100% a a how

873
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:59,680
can I say efficient one is conditioning

874
00:41:57,599 --> 00:42:02,480
what is breare conditioning is to take

875
00:41:59,679 --> 00:42:05,199
potatoes from that cold environment and

876
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:07,960
increase the temperature it's like this

877
00:42:05,199 --> 00:42:11,759
one so we have a potatoes stored at 4

878
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:15,000
Celsius that's a 39 fah and then

879
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:18,000
transfer to 16

880
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:20,838
Celsius take a look that this one G

881
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:22,838
gstar russet is cold resistant so it

882
00:42:20,838 --> 00:42:26,838
doesn't matter the temperature take a

883
00:42:22,838 --> 00:42:28,838
look at the color zeros zeros it's a

884
00:42:26,838 --> 00:42:32,039
really good variety to store at know at

885
00:42:28,838 --> 00:42:35,719
low temperature take a look at the

886
00:42:32,039 --> 00:42:38,000
fender it was USDA number three and then

887
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:39,598
when you increase the temperature it it

888
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:43,358
went down to

889
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:46,680
two but no I like to explain why what is

890
00:42:43,358 --> 00:42:49,920
behind this that's the

891
00:42:46,679 --> 00:42:52,000
respiration the respiration wasn't here

892
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:54,960
when we put that 16 take a look what

893
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:57,400
happened with the respiration this speak

894
00:42:54,960 --> 00:43:01,318
respiration is a process that that

895
00:42:57,400 --> 00:43:05,079
consumes sugar and by consuming sugars

896
00:43:01,318 --> 00:43:08,960
we you can improve a the quality but not

897
00:43:05,079 --> 00:43:11,440
a little bit well so the best way to to

898
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:12,599
do with this is a to get like cold

899
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:16,119
resistant

900
00:43:12,599 --> 00:43:17,960
variees good and also have biot

901
00:43:16,119 --> 00:43:22,599
technology as I showed that

902
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:27,000
PO the industry also is moving to have a

903
00:43:22,599 --> 00:43:29,318
a RNA interference a potatoes especially

904
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:31,838
a blocking the action of

905
00:43:29,318 --> 00:43:34,199
Inver with that we don't have this

906
00:43:31,838 --> 00:43:36,318
problem so because with the invert the

907
00:43:34,199 --> 00:43:37,439
sucrose cannot be converted in glucose

908
00:43:36,318 --> 00:43:39,960
and and

909
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:42,318
fructose and don't have a reducing

910
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:45,720
sugars and then the industry is doing

911
00:43:42,318 --> 00:43:49,400
that so I was talking with a Dr Ali

912
00:43:45,719 --> 00:43:51,959
maybe 20 years you're not going to have

913
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:53,800
any problem po Harvest because all the

914
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:57,838
Transformations they're going to solve

915
00:43:53,800 --> 00:44:00,440
all the problems that we we face

916
00:43:57,838 --> 00:44:03,318
and one of the other problems that we

917
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:04,800
fac is sprouting as I as I showed you

918
00:44:03,318 --> 00:44:07,239
you have the dorant

919
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:11,039
period and the dorant period now is

920
00:44:07,239 --> 00:44:14,039
related to the dormy that the potatoes a

921
00:44:11,039 --> 00:44:17,599
present so the dorcy is related to the

922
00:44:14,039 --> 00:44:21,159
accumulation of a hormone such as aysc

923
00:44:17,599 --> 00:44:24,079
acid that prevent the growth of the

924
00:44:21,159 --> 00:44:26,838
buds whenever this abic acid is

925
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:29,960
metabolized is oxidized then we have

926
00:44:26,838 --> 00:44:33,719
the the and many other metabolic a

927
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:33,720
process we can have the the

928
00:44:34,239 --> 00:44:42,239
Sprout again just to show that's a

929
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:45,000
adaptation for that period and it's

930
00:44:42,239 --> 00:44:47,439
really dependent on

931
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:49,599
variety and

932
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:51,679
temperature take a look at this standard

933
00:44:49,599 --> 00:44:56,440
Russ birbank at

934
00:44:51,679 --> 00:44:59,759
42 as a period of aous period of how

935
00:44:56,440 --> 00:45:04,000
many minutes sorry okay

936
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:08,559
175 days at 48

937
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:12,719
130 how can we store potatoes at what

938
00:45:08,559 --> 00:45:15,800
240 to almost a year so we need to apply

939
00:45:12,719 --> 00:45:19,759
a a chemicals to control that we can

940
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:22,079
apply in preh Harvest as as Mal hydr or

941
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:26,720
in the post harvest in the United States

942
00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:28,599
we we use a lot of chor profane that not

943
00:45:26,719 --> 00:45:30,759
is not allowed in the in in Europe

944
00:45:28,599 --> 00:45:33,838
anymore they use a lot of Eilene in

945
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:37,359
there so but know chopine is really

946
00:45:33,838 --> 00:45:41,838
effective take a look at this the same

947
00:45:37,358 --> 00:45:43,880
varieties 45 48 with cipc without cipc

948
00:45:41,838 --> 00:45:45,679
take a look how effective is this

949
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:49,000
product

950
00:45:45,679 --> 00:45:52,000
okay now again have biotechnology taking

951
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:54,119
place so controlling they start start

952
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:56,400
breakdown we don't have sucros and then

953
00:45:54,119 --> 00:46:01,640
we have potatoes without

954
00:45:56,400 --> 00:46:03,920
is proud and finally marketing so it's

955
00:46:01,639 --> 00:46:06,598
the same as apples we have just one

956
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:09,039
season in the year in Brazil have we

957
00:46:06,599 --> 00:46:11,838
have a luxury to have three seasons of

958
00:46:09,039 --> 00:46:13,279
potatoes here in United States just one

959
00:46:11,838 --> 00:46:16,358
and have to put these potatoes in the

960
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:18,720
storage and supply all the market it's

961
00:46:16,358 --> 00:46:19,558
not an easy task to take potatoes out of

962
00:46:18,719 --> 00:46:24,399
the

963
00:46:19,559 --> 00:46:26,760
storage uh we need to avoid new Bru that

964
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:28,880
the the industry called the old bruise

965
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:32,480
from the Harvest period and have the new

966
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:35,000
bruise that's formed in this uh this

967
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:37,519
step of the post Harvest management

968
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:39,358
especially if potatoes are really cold

969
00:46:37,519 --> 00:46:41,480
when they are really cold if they heat

970
00:46:39,358 --> 00:46:43,558
something they will shatter help to

971
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:46,519
increase the temperature a little bit to

972
00:46:43,559 --> 00:46:49,119
be able to take potatoes out and one of

973
00:46:46,519 --> 00:46:52,480
the main problems that causes a lot of a

974
00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:55,039
rejections is the flattening of potatoes

975
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:57,679
especially if they when they take this

976
00:46:55,039 --> 00:47:00,159
potatoes out of of the storage in four

977
00:46:57,679 --> 00:47:04,519
to 5 days we have this internal Browning

978
00:47:00,159 --> 00:47:04,519
that the industry called a cutting

979
00:47:04,719 --> 00:47:10,399
black for Fresh Market that's what we

980
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:13,318
are seeing Idaho a lot of robotization

981
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:17,039
and artificial intelligence used so this

982
00:47:13,318 --> 00:47:18,960
company the same company W they have

983
00:47:17,039 --> 00:47:21,838
seven

984
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:25,280
robots just three people working so it

985
00:47:21,838 --> 00:47:26,279
reminds me the the the book of yal

986
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:28,960
Harari

987
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:30,240
Homo sapiens and talk about artificial

988
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:31,800
intelligence

989
00:47:30,239 --> 00:47:35,358
substituting

990
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:38,318
us so take home message I don't have

991
00:47:35,358 --> 00:47:39,719
time just to show you I hope you had

992
00:47:38,318 --> 00:47:43,279
understand a little bit about potato

993
00:47:39,719 --> 00:47:46,118
post Harvest so we have all these things

994
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:51,280
taking place when we put potatoes in

995
00:47:46,119 --> 00:47:53,880
storage and I'd like to thank my my my

996
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:56,800
my team univers of Idaho so my

997
00:47:53,880 --> 00:48:00,240
technician Sam P my students from PhD

998
00:47:56,800 --> 00:48:02,839
from Brazil Vanessa ped and Mike Zoro at

999
00:48:00,239 --> 00:48:05,519
University of pido and and the potato

1000
00:48:02,838 --> 00:48:08,358
consor in USDA for funding my research

1001
00:48:05,519 --> 00:48:11,239
I'm I'm I have to do my altise I'm

1002
00:48:08,358 --> 00:48:14,598
hiring people especially MERS and PhD

1003
00:48:11,239 --> 00:48:16,838
student and saying that I open up for

1004
00:48:14,599 --> 00:48:19,599
questions thank you so much so the

1005
00:48:16,838 --> 00:48:21,838
question was if a Browning has some a

1006
00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:23,440
safety problems

1007
00:48:21,838 --> 00:48:27,639
yeah

1008
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:27,639
the if there isn't

1009
00:48:37,559 --> 00:48:42,480
no do you like coffee do you like tea do

1010
00:48:41,358 --> 00:48:45,159
you like

1011
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:49,199
chocolate all of all these

1012
00:48:45,159 --> 00:48:52,639
products they are dark because of

1013
00:48:49,199 --> 00:48:55,960
Po so for us to have like a dark

1014
00:48:52,639 --> 00:48:59,639
chocolate we have ch they have the the

1015
00:48:55,960 --> 00:49:02,159
Coco and a nuts the kernel and we put

1016
00:48:59,639 --> 00:49:06,239
them to ferment and after that we we

1017
00:49:02,159 --> 00:49:10,440
roast that roting process is a exactly

1018
00:49:06,239 --> 00:49:13,959
the PO a all this conversion of a

1019
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:16,960
compound a tea for example so many

1020
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:20,838
products that we eat the Browning

1021
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:23,000
actually is a a is really good for us so

1022
00:49:20,838 --> 00:49:25,759
that part you know so doesn't that have

1023
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:28,599
any a a safety concern the only think

1024
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:32,599
that's a nutritional concern because

1025
00:49:28,599 --> 00:49:34,880
when po a reacts with the amino acids

1026
00:49:32,599 --> 00:49:37,000
reduces the avilability of proteins and

1027
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:40,760
amino acids for us but it's not in the

1028
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:45,318
point that we reduce the protein

1029
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:45,319
content thank you great thank you so

1030
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:57,160
much this has been a production of

1031
00:49:54,039 --> 00:50:00,159
