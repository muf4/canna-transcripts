1
00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:08,610
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,218 --> 00:00:10,169
University Thank You Carl okay yeah I'll

3
00:00:08,609 --> 00:00:14,820
be talking a bit about my research of

4
00:00:10,169 --> 00:00:17,070
malting barley today okay so in 2012

5
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:18,839
there were 92 craft breweries in New

6
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:22,440
York for breweries in general New York

7
00:00:18,839 --> 00:00:24,778
now in 2018 we have over 400 breweries

8
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:27,600
in New York and that timeframe breweries

9
00:00:24,778 --> 00:00:29,698
across United States boom but the growth

10
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:32,910
and breweries is particularly striking

11
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:35,460
in New York State much of this could be

12
00:00:32,909 --> 00:00:37,500
attributed to the farm brewery bill this

13
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:40,380
is a state bill that it was passed in

14
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:44,238
2012 that provides economic incentives

15
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:47,969
for locally produced ingredients

16
00:00:44,238 --> 00:00:50,669
specifically at the current quota farm

17
00:00:47,969 --> 00:00:53,989
breweries must use at least 20% locally

18
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:57,480
grown hops and 20% locally grown malts

19
00:00:53,988 --> 00:01:00,839
these incentives that quota increases

20
00:00:57,479 --> 00:01:03,328
the 60 percent in 2019 so this is a

21
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:07,560
couple weeks here and increases finally

22
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:09,899
to 9% in 2024 currently we're producing

23
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:12,799
an up malting barley in New York to meet

24
00:01:09,899 --> 00:01:15,358
these quotas even if the 60% increase in

25
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:17,719
2019 however Cornell Cooperative

26
00:01:15,358 --> 00:01:21,568
Extension has set an ambitious goal of

27
00:01:17,718 --> 00:01:24,149
30,000 acres by 2023 to account for the

28
00:01:21,569 --> 00:01:25,740
demand at the 90 percent quota so we're

29
00:01:24,149 --> 00:01:27,778
to meet that meet that goal we must

30
00:01:25,739 --> 00:01:31,468
increase malting barley acreage in New

31
00:01:27,778 --> 00:01:33,388
York however high quality multi bar

32
00:01:31,468 --> 00:01:35,788
leaves not an easy thing to produce in

33
00:01:33,388 --> 00:01:37,528
New York this is largely due to the wet

34
00:01:35,789 --> 00:01:39,618
humid climate in New York that we

35
00:01:37,528 --> 00:01:42,028
frequently have during our summers

36
00:01:39,618 --> 00:01:44,340
there's a long list of problems that can

37
00:01:42,028 --> 00:01:46,828
happen I'm gonna talk about two today

38
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:49,889
specifically the first is pre-harvest

39
00:01:46,828 --> 00:01:51,958
freighting which is a premature loss of

40
00:01:49,888 --> 00:01:54,839
dormancy in the field before the grain

41
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:58,109
is harvested which can reduce which

42
00:01:54,840 --> 00:02:00,118
results in early germination when a

43
00:01:58,108 --> 00:02:03,808
moisture event occurs such as a heavy

44
00:02:00,118 --> 00:02:05,509
dew or prolonged rain the second that

45
00:02:03,808 --> 00:02:08,368
I'll talk about is foliar disease

46
00:02:05,509 --> 00:02:11,098
specifically Lee for us and smog watch

47
00:02:08,368 --> 00:02:13,530
these are both diseases they can cause a

48
00:02:11,098 --> 00:02:14,069
loss in stock logic and also negatively

49
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:18,000
in

50
00:02:14,069 --> 00:02:19,919
impact grain quality so to meet these

51
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,139
challenges the Cornell small grains

52
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:24,829
breeding program initiated a project

53
00:02:22,139 --> 00:02:27,719
that we're calling born bred and brewed

54
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:30,060
and our goals are to support farm

55
00:02:27,719 --> 00:02:33,300
brewing by quickly meeting the needs of

56
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:35,090
local monsters and brewers who are

57
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:38,250
operating under the farm brewery bill

58
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:40,590
we're hoping to breed high dormancy to

59
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:43,020
avoid fear of sprouting disease

60
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:45,629
resistant varieties that have high multi

61
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:47,520
quality across the variety of New York

62
00:02:45,629 --> 00:02:49,620
environments wealth and quality also

63
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:51,570
needs to be stable because monsters and

64
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:54,000
brewers need a consistent supply of malt

65
00:02:51,569 --> 00:02:56,579
to make consistent here year after year

66
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,860
so to do this we're establishing a two

67
00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:02,070
row spring barley breeding program at

68
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:04,710
cornell monsters and brewers want a New

69
00:03:02,069 --> 00:03:07,199
York barley variety yesterday act

70
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:09,210
quickly naturally assumed and I'm in

71
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:10,729
Sorrells lab and then my Cornell our

72
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:14,790
perch is going to be genomic selection

73
00:03:10,729 --> 00:03:16,919
but we wanted to make this we want to

74
00:03:14,789 --> 00:03:19,530
hit a homerun on the first try because

75
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:21,509
with this strict time limit set by the

76
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:24,989
farm brewery bill we don't have a lot of

77
00:03:21,509 --> 00:03:27,629
time to waste in breeding so our

78
00:03:24,989 --> 00:03:30,150
approach is to use a nested Association

79
00:03:27,629 --> 00:03:33,209
mapping style designs for our genomic

80
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:34,800
prediction training population those not

81
00:03:33,209 --> 00:03:37,259
familiar with the nested Association

82
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:38,820
mapping panel or an am basically a

83
00:03:37,259 --> 00:03:41,340
collection of have said families

84
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:43,500
connected by a common parent and the

85
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:45,840
idea here is to use the beneficial

86
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:48,360
statistical properties of Anam to

87
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:52,229
increase our prediction accuracy high

88
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:54,390
relatedness large population size more

89
00:03:52,229 --> 00:03:54,840
efficient genotyping use the population

90
00:03:54,389 --> 00:03:56,029
structure

91
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:59,250
[Music]

92
00:03:56,030 --> 00:04:01,739
ideally increasing a variance multiple

93
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:03,509
families instead of just one or two and

94
00:04:01,739 --> 00:04:05,819
then also high power for genome-wide

95
00:04:03,509 --> 00:04:07,469
association studies since we're doing

96
00:04:05,819 --> 00:04:09,539
genomic prediction we're not interested

97
00:04:07,469 --> 00:04:11,550
in a genetic architecture per se of

98
00:04:09,539 --> 00:04:13,979
these traits but we're interested in

99
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:16,199
adding and he fixed that any of pipe

100
00:04:13,979 --> 00:04:18,719
effects markers low side has fixed

101
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:20,759
effects in our prediction models even if

102
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,320
none of these work it's the use of

103
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:24,659
breeding population to start a breeding

104
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:29,519
program

105
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:32,370
so our approach was to use variety AAC

106
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:34,319
synergy is our common parent this is

107
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:36,810
performed fairly well for us in New York

108
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:38,969
State it has high yield time wealth

109
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:40,410
quality and high disease resistance but

110
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:44,120
does not have a good harvest riding

111
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:47,430
resistance we use seven other parents

112
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:50,370
energy and we ended up with a population

113
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:54,540
of about 1,300 lines so a little under

114
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:57,449
200 lines per family in 2017 so last

115
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:59,670
field season to locate two hetero

116
00:04:57,449 --> 00:05:01,709
locations of f3 derived at four lines

117
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:03,540
were grown and you know type for the

118
00:05:01,709 --> 00:05:06,359
traits listed there to train the

119
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:08,280
prediction model and this year a subset

120
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:09,900
of 100 lines from that training

121
00:05:08,279 --> 00:05:11,429
population were thrown into regional

122
00:05:09,899 --> 00:05:14,939
yield trials and I'll come back to that

123
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:16,680
so this principal component analysis

124
00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:20,250
here shows and gives a nice indication

125
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:21,990
of population structure here so because

126
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:25,439
got a little washed out with the green

127
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:27,990
and orange cross is made from North

128
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:29,819
American germ plasm North American

129
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:32,100
barley germ plasm is not very diverse

130
00:05:29,819 --> 00:05:34,170
it's been heavily selected for multi

131
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:37,260
quality over the past years so it's all

132
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:39,300
pretty closely related right there at

133
00:05:37,259 --> 00:05:41,610
the top you can stairs this little

134
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:43,740
yellow cluster it's actually a back

135
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:46,620
cross we didn't realize the New Deal is

136
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:48,420
one of the parents but it is so we have

137
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:51,030
that and then the blue dots are in the

138
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:53,220
middle that's a European by Canadian

139
00:05:51,029 --> 00:05:56,309
cross and the European multi Varley germ

140
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:59,370
plasm is kept very separate so a lot

141
00:05:56,310 --> 00:06:01,079
more diversity there okay so our

142
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:04,740
genotyping approach in this population

143
00:06:01,079 --> 00:06:07,289
was to genotype the progeny at a higher

144
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:09,569
flex than the parents so with this many

145
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:10,830
wines and needed for libraries so the

146
00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:13,170
parents are present in each of those

147
00:06:10,829 --> 00:06:15,120
library each of those four libraries for

148
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:16,740
the progeny only present wants so the

149
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:19,920
parents got sequence at four times

150
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:21,629
greater depth progeny we are able to

151
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:24,420
line these sequences to the recently

152
00:06:21,629 --> 00:06:26,850
updated by in our first genome which is

153
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:28,460
pretty good so we're confident in our

154
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:31,080
physical positions of these markers

155
00:06:28,459 --> 00:06:34,379
because all the parents are inbred lines

156
00:06:31,079 --> 00:06:36,240
and released varieties I was pretty

157
00:06:34,379 --> 00:06:37,899
stringent with the parental filters so

158
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,810
removed any heterozygote

159
00:06:37,899 --> 00:06:44,229
heterozygous sites any missing sites and

160
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:46,810
only kept I was very confident for those

161
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:49,480
geo type calls and then within family I

162
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:52,800
included markers for those parents and

163
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:55,210
any other missing data were imputed with

164
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:59,770
expectation-maximization in our blood

165
00:06:55,209 --> 00:07:04,319
and are the usual heterozygosity in

166
00:06:59,769 --> 00:07:07,810
family and then a final filter to remove

167
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:13,719
with each other so that gives me about

168
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:15,970
six thousand okay so I'm working here

169
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:19,240
with single trait G blood models that's

170
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:24,730
it and as our you can tested with the

171
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:28,600
five so there's a lot going on here but

172
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:31,240
these gray boxes correspond to friction

173
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:33,250
activities with the entire set and each

174
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:35,620
of the colored boxes refers the

175
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:37,990
individual families here so there's a

176
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:39,910
couple trans that jump out here the

177
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:41,710
first is that when you look at the gray

178
00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:44,860
boxes these prediction actresses for the

179
00:07:41,709 --> 00:07:46,539
whole set they tend to be as high or

180
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:49,710
higher than prediction accuracy is

181
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:51,460
within each family we're hoping to see

182
00:07:49,709 --> 00:07:53,979
prediction accuracy is within each

183
00:07:51,459 --> 00:07:59,259
family vary widely depending on a cheat

184
00:07:53,980 --> 00:08:01,180
rate varies a lot

185
00:07:59,259 --> 00:08:03,969
specifically notice this yellow box here

186
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:06,550
in the middle family and has

187
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:08,980
consistently low prediction accuracy for

188
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:10,920
games great and is consistently lower

189
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:13,240
than the majority of the other families

190
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:14,830
the standard deviations for the

191
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:16,480
prediction accuracies are quite a bit

192
00:08:14,829 --> 00:08:18,969
higher for pre-harvest sprouting and

193
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:21,430
spot watch is likely due to incomplete

194
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:23,260
no typing for those traits pre ever

195
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:25,240
sprouting is a very labor-intensive and

196
00:08:23,259 --> 00:08:27,219
time-sensitive phenotype so we weren't

197
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:30,519
able to phenotype at large the

198
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:31,870
population and then spot watch the data

199
00:08:30,519 --> 00:08:34,809
was incomplete due to premature

200
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:37,200
senescence because a rapid disease

201
00:08:34,809 --> 00:08:37,199
progression

202
00:08:37,479 --> 00:08:42,349
jiwa models were fit in our book with a

203
00:08:40,549 --> 00:08:44,569
single principle component added to

204
00:08:42,349 --> 00:08:46,699
account for population structure the

205
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:49,250
hits that we see for leaf rust and force

206
00:08:46,698 --> 00:08:51,049
pop watch lie within regions that have

207
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:53,799
been previously not for these two traits

208
00:08:51,049 --> 00:08:56,958
we're fairly confident these are real

209
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:59,359
this very large effects locus here for

210
00:08:56,958 --> 00:09:02,958
pre-harvest writing is in the region

211
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:06,740
that a recency gene wiesen and that

212
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:12,349
German so also confident about that and

213
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:14,990
this height locus is close to Earth

214
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:18,379
energy using here Ian malting barley

215
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:21,860
germ plasm and that alleles on the

216
00:09:18,379 --> 00:09:26,929
present in the European cross

217
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:29,649
so the marker data that's useful so

218
00:09:26,929 --> 00:09:31,819
again we're not interested in understand

219
00:09:29,649 --> 00:09:34,159
these traits we want to see if it

220
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:37,129
increases prediction accuracy but

221
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:41,059
fortunately it seems that only adding

222
00:09:37,129 --> 00:09:43,700
that very large increases prediction

223
00:09:41,059 --> 00:09:45,279
accuracy every when we take a little bit

224
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:47,990
closer look at trait heritability and

225
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:49,759
percentages Matic variance explained by

226
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:52,279
these low-side the pictures a little

227
00:09:49,759 --> 00:09:54,470
more clear so Rex Bernardo was looking

228
00:09:52,279 --> 00:09:58,399
at the same problem and a simulation

229
00:09:54,470 --> 00:10:00,560
study in 2010 and his results somewhat

230
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:04,220
mirror mine so for traits that have low

231
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:06,019
heritability and have say gee Wasat that

232
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:07,879
doesn't explain that much of the genetic

233
00:10:06,019 --> 00:10:10,730
variance to something like height or

234
00:10:07,879 --> 00:10:12,919
spot watch low percentage of genetic

235
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:15,080
creation' explain adding a picture that

236
00:10:12,919 --> 00:10:16,569
doesn't really change accuracy which is

237
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:18,740
what we see for height and spot watch

238
00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:20,270
however for a trait like pre-harvest

239
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:23,330
sprouting that has very high

240
00:10:20,269 --> 00:10:25,669
heritability and has a lot of that

241
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:26,870
genetic variance not surprisingly that

242
00:10:25,669 --> 00:10:29,059
will increase your prediction accuracy

243
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:30,980
which is what we see leave for us is a

244
00:10:29,059 --> 00:10:33,500
bit puzzling though because we have high

245
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:35,539
heritability and the percentage of

246
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:37,730
genetic variance explained is not low

247
00:10:35,539 --> 00:10:40,219
but it's not really increasing the

248
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:44,629
accuracy so that's a little mysterious

249
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:46,899
still when we use the 2017 training

250
00:10:44,629 --> 00:10:52,519
population data though to predict

251
00:10:46,899 --> 00:10:56,600
unobserved trial trials adding fixative

252
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:59,809
x as a more significant impact so n here

253
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:01,850
is a number of 2008 that tres4 measured

254
00:10:59,809 --> 00:11:03,439
n so when we add fixed effects through

255
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:04,970
these traits you can see prediction

256
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,470
accuracy increases quite a bit

257
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:08,629
especially for Korea responding

258
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:09,590
illustrates there's something like

259
00:11:08,629 --> 00:11:10,759
pretty reverse crowding this is

260
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:13,100
particularly promising

261
00:11:10,759 --> 00:11:16,610
pre-harvest routing like I said is a

262
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:19,040
very time intensive and labor-intensive

263
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:20,720
process to phenotype and we can only do

264
00:11:19,039 --> 00:11:22,519
this locally but it's one of our most

265
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:24,080
important traits having good predictions

266
00:11:22,519 --> 00:11:27,189
for I observe yield trials for this

267
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:28,569
trait would be of great value

268
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:30,579
another thing we'd like to do and we're

269
00:11:28,568 --> 00:11:34,269
starting a genomic selection project

270
00:11:30,578 --> 00:11:38,289
from scratch is to use a few markers as

271
00:11:34,269 --> 00:11:40,360
possible to reduce costs so at a number

272
00:11:38,289 --> 00:11:41,799
of different marker densities going from

273
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:47,560
full marker density all the way to one

274
00:11:41,799 --> 00:11:51,688
per set I sample these entities and use

275
00:11:47,559 --> 00:11:53,828
five fold cross validation to test sets

276
00:11:51,688 --> 00:11:56,318
promising lis it looks like we can go

277
00:11:53,828 --> 00:11:58,719
down to about 10% of the total marker

278
00:11:56,318 --> 00:11:59,500
set and maintain prediction accuracy for

279
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:05,170
most rates

280
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:08,129
so that's markers this is partially do I

281
00:12:05,169 --> 00:12:11,289
think because barley naturally has high

282
00:12:08,129 --> 00:12:15,730
population structure helps you see more

283
00:12:11,289 --> 00:12:22,828
prediction accuracy tails off likely due

284
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:22,829
to that when you're only sampling a

285
00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:29,259
marker in LD with that main cause of

286
00:12:27,009 --> 00:12:32,589
locus decreases accordingly so

287
00:12:29,259 --> 00:12:39,699
prediction accuracy drops lastly we

288
00:12:32,589 --> 00:12:42,009
would like to have a lot of work so I

289
00:12:39,698 --> 00:12:44,349
did use a similar conservation strategy

290
00:12:42,009 --> 00:12:47,019
and testing smaller training population

291
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:52,360
sets for most traits we can get down to

292
00:12:47,019 --> 00:12:55,448
fifty seventy-five population set size

293
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:57,009
and still maintain accuracy every day we

294
00:12:55,448 --> 00:13:02,019
see this major drop-off in pre have a

295
00:12:57,009 --> 00:13:06,818
sprouting I think that that's so I'm

296
00:13:02,019 --> 00:13:09,159
only harvesting when you drop that by

297
00:13:06,818 --> 00:13:10,870
seventy five or fifty percent you have

298
00:13:09,159 --> 00:13:15,338
many fewer individuals that you're using

299
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:18,068
there so with these results and our

300
00:13:15,339 --> 00:13:20,139
regional yield trails in 2018 plus

301
00:13:18,068 --> 00:13:21,818
healed trials next year we're confident

302
00:13:20,139 --> 00:13:23,860
that in New York malting barley isn't

303
00:13:21,818 --> 00:13:25,568
been reach we've identified high

304
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:28,000
yielding disease resistant and

305
00:13:25,568 --> 00:13:29,849
pre-harvest writing resist behind but we

306
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,799
still don't know how they malts across

307
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:34,569
environments across years so this data

308
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:36,490
we're waiting on and that picture become

309
00:13:34,568 --> 00:13:38,349
work for the next year

310
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:40,840
we're definitely speeding this process

311
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:45,610
along and we're hoping to identify

312
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:48,580
riot II candidate and all 2019 and get

313
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:51,370
that in Foundation seed in 2020 hopeful

314
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:53,379
farmer Luke's in the next year to the

315
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:56,620
other part of my dissertation research

316
00:13:53,379 --> 00:13:58,299
is using selections from the straining

317
00:13:56,620 --> 00:14:01,060
population to initiate a genomic

318
00:13:58,299 --> 00:14:03,879
selection experiment currently we did

319
00:14:01,059 --> 00:14:06,729
two rounds of that by validation will be

320
00:14:03,879 --> 00:14:09,279
this summer in the fields soon for that

321
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:11,440
I would like to thank my committee

322
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:14,470
members actually present members in

323
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:19,420
Sorrells lab and folks in the Burj Dubai

324
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:20,980
on slab as well as funding partners and

325
00:14:19,419 --> 00:14:22,559
if that would be happy to take any

326
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:29,139
questions

327
00:14:22,559 --> 00:14:29,138
[Applause]

328
00:14:34,809 --> 00:14:41,500
mark had grown yield trials for two or

329
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:43,629
three years before I got here and at the

330
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:46,899
time those were our best performers in

331
00:14:43,629 --> 00:14:48,070
the day she had going back I would not

332
00:14:46,899 --> 00:14:50,799
choose some of those parents

333
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:55,180
particularly retail the one that was the

334
00:14:50,799 --> 00:14:56,949
back cross but uh yeah sorry so Margaret

335
00:14:55,179 --> 00:14:59,859
asked why did we choose the parents that

336
00:14:56,950 --> 00:15:03,820
we did we went on what existing data we

337
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:05,230
had three years of yield trials but if I

338
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:08,830
were to do this again I would choose

339
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:10,629
some different parents yeah I'm just

340
00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:12,280
curious like what you could do because I

341
00:15:10,629 --> 00:15:15,059
feel like all the prediction actor sees

342
00:15:12,279 --> 00:15:18,789
like what you really wanted was the pre

343
00:15:15,059 --> 00:15:20,319
sprouted we pre are sprouting yeah but

344
00:15:18,789 --> 00:15:22,809
like that was the hardest thing to

345
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:24,520
predict at least like with lower markers

346
00:15:22,809 --> 00:15:27,339
and things like that so yeah what could

347
00:15:24,519 --> 00:15:28,689
you do - this is the identical question

348
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:29,710
if you were to do the experiment again

349
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:32,440
is there something you could do

350
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:35,320
differently to like make sure your

351
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:37,060
predictions of that are better yeah so I

352
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:38,940
think the biggest thing since I've been

353
00:15:37,059 --> 00:15:41,500
more completely and I think that that

354
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:43,330
sorry-looking in the question so the

355
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:45,220
question was forever surrounding is our

356
00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:47,110
most important trait but had the most

357
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:48,759
severe drop in prediction accuracy when

358
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:52,389
we did subsets

359
00:15:48,759 --> 00:15:56,230
I think the keator is more like I said

360
00:15:52,389 --> 00:15:59,049
we only phenotype about 400 to 450 of

361
00:15:56,230 --> 00:16:00,970
those 1,300 lines because you have to

362
00:15:59,049 --> 00:16:03,879
sample them at physiological maturity

363
00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:06,310
which has a very short window so either

364
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:09,730
we hired three times as many undergrads

365
00:16:06,309 --> 00:16:15,189
which could work or we have a smaller

366
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:17,620
size or work 16-hour days either one of

367
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:18,970
those but I'm I was pretty happy with

368
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:21,129
the prediction accuracy who did

369
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:23,950
differently harvest writing we knew very

370
00:16:21,129 --> 00:16:25,899
little about the genetic control of this

371
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:27,730
trait and our population and how it

372
00:16:25,899 --> 00:16:30,159
worked in New York we haven't looked

373
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:34,110
fair idea of N and wheat but these

374
00:16:30,159 --> 00:16:34,110
results I think are useful early

375
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:52,009
okay yeah yes was that from a good was

376
00:16:44,509 --> 00:16:53,990
it from the other ones overall yeah so

377
00:16:52,009 --> 00:16:57,230
the question was there's this kind of

378
00:16:53,990 --> 00:17:00,230
extra blind take which is a European

379
00:16:57,230 --> 00:17:02,000
variety from kws so bread for

380
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:04,220
continental European climates like

381
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,289
France and Germany which in our

382
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:09,110
experience those lines and to perform a

383
00:17:06,289 --> 00:17:10,730
little bit better New York there's a lot

384
00:17:09,109 --> 00:17:14,379
of barley breeding in the UK but those

385
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:18,110
lines are adapted to a maritime climate

386
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:20,180
what school in the UK and you can get

387
00:17:18,109 --> 00:17:22,338
pretty hot summers the lines thread for

388
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:23,990
Germany in France the better if you

389
00:17:22,338 --> 00:17:26,139
don't typically it looks fairly similar

390
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:29,900
it is a little bit shorter it's

391
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:32,180
susceptible to several diseases here but

392
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:35,509
it has a good mounting quality these are

393
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:37,220
all to row lines so to malting barley

394
00:17:35,509 --> 00:17:40,519
all kind of sort of looks the same

395
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:43,220
unless you spend hours in the FIFO so

396
00:17:40,519 --> 00:17:51,369
yeah it looks similar but as a lot more

397
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:51,370
teenagers alright thank you
