1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:04,759
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:11,359
University thank you so much Andy and

3
00:00:09,279 --> 00:00:13,599
thank you everyone for being here is it

4
00:00:11,359 --> 00:00:16,039
is it circular bionutrient economy or is

5
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:20,759
it the pizza either way I appreciate

6
00:00:16,039 --> 00:00:22,359
you're being here um so okay so uh I'd

7
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:24,960
like to thank the the section of s and

8
00:00:22,359 --> 00:00:27,880
crop science for the invitation and to

9
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,519
say that it came about because I'm

10
00:00:27,879 --> 00:00:32,439
trying to recruit a student who's a real

11
00:00:29,518 --> 00:00:34,280
circular by Neutron Economist and this

12
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:35,960
section would be a better uh host for

13
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:37,759
her she'd rather become a soil scientist

14
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:41,679
than a plant pathologist that was was

15
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:44,159
the consensus but really my my desire to

16
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:46,159
be part of this family is uh arises from

17
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:49,198
the deeper considerations that Andy

18
00:00:46,159 --> 00:00:50,599
outlined I think um I think of myself as

19
00:00:49,198 --> 00:00:52,878
in part of this sort of one Health

20
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:54,879
framework that planetary health is

21
00:00:52,878 --> 00:00:57,079
determining soil health or influencing

22
00:00:54,878 --> 00:00:58,799
soil Health which influences plant

23
00:00:57,079 --> 00:01:00,439
health and which influences human health

24
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:01,759
and so seeing myself within that I'm

25
00:01:00,439 --> 00:01:03,358
sort of shifting from the plant Health

26
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:05,000
to the soil Health which seems to be

27
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:07,320
something that's going on in in the

28
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,599
broader sips Community this word cloud

29
00:01:07,319 --> 00:01:12,639
that uh these word clouds that just

30
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:15,000
presented at the 10 anniversary party

31
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:17,759
show 2020 I'm working solidly on

32
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,959
genomics of resistance and by now much

33
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:22,359
more interested in soil carbon so um I

34
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:24,000
wish I could say I was driving that

35
00:01:22,359 --> 00:01:25,560
change but I think I'm just reflecting

36
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,640
maybe a shift in interest that's broader

37
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:29,240
than myself um so my interest in

38
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:32,519
bionutrient circularity I share with a

39
00:01:29,239 --> 00:01:35,560
number of people in this room and um I'm

40
00:01:32,519 --> 00:01:37,879
very keen to help as we try to you know

41
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:40,118
improve our our internal capacity for

42
00:01:37,879 --> 00:01:43,280
analyzing nutrients contaminants and

43
00:01:40,118 --> 00:01:45,640
other materials internally here at at in

44
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:47,680
sips and at Cornell because um I think a

45
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:48,640
lot of us are suffering from limitations

46
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:51,799
in that

47
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:54,079
regard so today I'd like to talk about

48
00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:56,960
this idea of circular Food Systems

49
00:01:54,078 --> 00:01:58,359
circular B nutrient economy um as Andy

50
00:01:56,959 --> 00:02:00,839
mentioned the professional pivots that

51
00:01:58,359 --> 00:02:04,000
got me to this place and sort of some

52
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:05,960
initial progress in a in a long process

53
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,239
Explorations experiments some of the

54
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:09,919
downside risks how can change happen

55
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:12,840
here and in Africa as

56
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:14,878
well and before diving in I want to

57
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:16,560
thank my the wonderful colleagues in my

58
00:02:14,878 --> 00:02:18,840
lab I think Christina known to many of

59
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,959
you as could be thank for a bunch be

60
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:22,280
showing and um Florest is our lab

61
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:23,680
manager and we got a great team of

62
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:25,640
people um many of whom are

63
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:29,200
undergraduates some of whom are present

64
00:02:25,639 --> 00:02:31,839
here um Johan's lab is a important you

65
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:33,799
know key collab ators in this area

66
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:36,598
schano and Global development as well

67
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:38,439
and Charles Mig is my my lead partner in

68
00:02:36,598 --> 00:02:39,799
Kenya and we have the pleasure of

69
00:02:38,439 --> 00:02:41,439
working with the Richard Institute and

70
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,959
The Wider soil Factory Network on this

71
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:45,598
sort of

72
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:47,280
topic so the basic proposition that I'll

73
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:50,639
be

74
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:52,080
um putting forth today is um the idea

75
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:54,039
that we would redirect our bodily

76
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,360
nutrients in the um particularly in from

77
00:02:54,039 --> 00:03:00,519
urine from The Aquatic

78
00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:02,519
environment to agriculture so um now

79
00:03:00,519 --> 00:03:04,360
since we direct those nutrients into the

80
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:06,640
Aquatic environment it's a hazard for

81
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:10,000
that you got harmful algo blooms

82
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:11,919
nutrification and so on if uh and in

83
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,360
many situations the the land and

84
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:16,479
agriculture are suffering from depletion

85
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:18,959
of nutrients and carbon or nutrients in

86
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:20,479
this case so the the extent to which

87
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:23,560
this is a big deal depends on the

88
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:27,119
context so globally speaking urinary

89
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:29,598
nutrients would account for around 19%

90
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:33,519
of the synthetic uh nitrogen that we put

91
00:03:29,598 --> 00:03:36,798
on our crops uh about 11% of the

92
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:38,519
phosphorus um and in uh the US is sort

93
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:40,120
of bit less than that because we Import

94
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:43,239
and Export so much nutrient in the form

95
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:45,879
of food and fertilizer um but in many

96
00:03:43,239 --> 00:03:47,759
African countries you know it's the

97
00:03:45,878 --> 00:03:49,239
amount of nutrients in our their the

98
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:51,560
urine there would be exceed the amount

99
00:03:49,239 --> 00:03:53,400
of nutrients they apply as as synthetic

100
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:54,479
fertilizer so they could do much better

101
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:57,158
with agriculture if they were

102
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:58,518
redirecting their nutrients and so um I

103
00:03:57,158 --> 00:04:00,479
don't know if any of you have seen the

104
00:03:58,519 --> 00:04:04,560
the peaw we have on

105
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:07,759
um egg quad for for some festivals but

106
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:09,360
with johann's Squad we're like able to

107
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:10,919
show with that that in New York state if

108
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,239
we could take the urine the urinary

109
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:13,479
nutrients from New York City and apply

110
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:15,719
them it would cover much of the nutrient

111
00:04:13,479 --> 00:04:18,279
Farms of New York in

112
00:04:15,719 --> 00:04:20,720
Paris the Environ the agricultural

113
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:23,319
environment around there which is a lot

114
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:25,240
um could completely use uh suffice its

115
00:04:23,319 --> 00:04:27,360
nut nitrogen needs and about half its

116
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:31,160
phosphorus needs if it used paris's

117
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:33,280
Urban uh urinary nutrients anyway so

118
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:35,160
where you are the the details depend but

119
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:38,959
it's generally I think a a proposition

120
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:42,560
worth considering so I was standing on a

121
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:44,758
bridge in nem ner a while back watching

122
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:48,720
this camel come into town with a bunch

123
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:50,280
of cow PE a load of cowp HMS on its back

124
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,720
there's a festival coming up and I'm

125
00:04:50,279 --> 00:04:54,359
thinking how long can this go on they're

126
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,560
bringing all the carbon and nutrients

127
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:58,879
from the already depleted agricultural

128
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,160
soil into the city where it's you know

129
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:02,159
winds up as being

130
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:04,560
pollution for the urban and Aquatic

131
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:06,160
environments and globally speaking 2.3

132
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:09,079
billion people lack even basic

133
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:11,160
sanitation and 80% of excr go untreated

134
00:05:09,079 --> 00:05:13,719
into the water ways while we're further

135
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:16,479
depleting our agricultural soils like

136
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:18,960
this the fundamentals are untenable here

137
00:05:16,478 --> 00:05:20,800
and then so I'm thinking like how can

138
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:22,758
this you know what can we do about this

139
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:26,319
and then later on I'm with these farmers

140
00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:29,960
and uh this is this is actually from a a

141
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:32,000
video take by my son but um these these

142
00:05:29,959 --> 00:05:34,799
uh farm this farmer group 10,000 farmer

143
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,120
group led by let me knew Ali here they

144
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,759
they were asking themselves that

145
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:39,519
question like we you know where are we

146
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:41,759
going to get our nutrients and so they

147
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:44,478
started applying uh urine to their

148
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:46,000
fields and um it's gotten to be a big

149
00:05:44,478 --> 00:05:47,199
thing now so I was really inspired by

150
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,720
them but then I realized well actually

151
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:51,680
it's not just some backa Beyond people

152
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:53,720
in a remote difficult situation they're

153
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,478
doing that the French are super into it

154
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:57,800
they've got companies that are making

155
00:05:55,478 --> 00:05:59,918
fertilizers from uran they've got an

156
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:02,439
entire neighborhood of Paris that's you

157
00:05:59,918 --> 00:06:04,359
know Plumbing for this um I kind of like

158
00:06:02,439 --> 00:06:05,959
the way they show that yellow gold rush

159
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:08,720
they got style of course and even the

160
00:06:05,959 --> 00:06:10,918
way they show the fact that um most in

161
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:13,000
terms of our food that we take in the

162
00:06:10,918 --> 00:06:14,959
nutrients we take in most of them come

163
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,720
out most of the NPK come out in our

164
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:20,359
urine relatively little in our feces in

165
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:22,400
contrast from the micronutrients are

166
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:23,960
coming out more in the poop so we have

167
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:26,799
risk of having not enough of some of

168
00:06:23,959 --> 00:06:29,120
those micronutrients we use urine as a

169
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:31,720
fertilizer I also really like the way

170
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:34,199
these are showing this bigger vision of

171
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:35,960
okay uh food comes into the city from

172
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:37,840
the from the countryside it should be

173
00:06:35,959 --> 00:06:39,598
coming out as biow this is their kind of

174
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:41,638
signature move for how to technically

175
00:06:39,598 --> 00:06:43,120
pull it off the carbon and nutrients

176
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:45,360
should return to Agriculture and I think

177
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:47,720
you'll recognize that as you know a plea

178
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:52,120
for sort of circularity in the food

179
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:55,280
system so we we live in a um

180
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:56,759
indescribably wasteful era I mean if you

181
00:06:55,279 --> 00:06:58,839
the more you think about it don't think

182
00:06:56,759 --> 00:07:02,000
about it as much as I do it'll wreck

183
00:06:58,839 --> 00:07:02,918
your head but um so this is provoking a

184
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,680
lot of people start thinking about

185
00:07:02,918 --> 00:07:07,159
circular economy how can we design out

186
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:08,360
waste keep materials in circulation and

187
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:10,960
regenerate

188
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:13,840
nature this being a very powerful

189
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:16,680
thought these being very you know

190
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:19,519
practicable tactics and stuff so people

191
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:21,598
generally distinguish between how you go

192
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:23,038
about it for biological materials and

193
00:07:21,598 --> 00:07:25,360
how you go about it for technical

194
00:07:23,038 --> 00:07:27,360
materials are quite different um in

195
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:29,919
terms of the the literature on circular

196
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:32,560
economy I did a citation search and you

197
00:07:29,918 --> 00:07:35,318
find that um over the last few years 27

198
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:39,439
to 2013 you go from 800 and some to

199
00:07:35,319 --> 00:07:40,639
8,000 and some citations um per year but

200
00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:43,079
most of

201
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:45,759
them the vast majority are about the

202
00:07:43,079 --> 00:07:47,279
technical materials and only 15% have

203
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:49,800
relevance to the food system as

204
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:51,598
indicated by searching circular economy

205
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:54,560
and food system nutrient or agriculture

206
00:07:51,598 --> 00:07:56,079
so we're bringing up the rear and it's

207
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:58,519
it's more complicated people often think

208
00:07:56,079 --> 00:08:03,878
of circular economy as these neat Loops

209
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:06,279
phone to phone carpet to carpet um for

210
00:08:03,879 --> 00:08:09,158
for organic materials it's more like

211
00:08:06,279 --> 00:08:10,839
this beautiful tangle of these different

212
00:08:09,158 --> 00:08:13,560
things and this is from a nice paper

213
00:08:10,839 --> 00:08:16,198
about contaminants so it's complicated

214
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:19,720
operationally materially it's

215
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:22,158
complicated downside riskwise

216
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:24,879
and we we have fewer tactics at our

217
00:08:22,158 --> 00:08:27,680
disposal if you're going to be doing

218
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:29,520
technical materials you can reuse repair

219
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,319
refurbish remanufacture repurpose but if

220
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:35,158
you're looking at Biologicals you're

221
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:37,639
with a much smaller set of r words but

222
00:08:35,158 --> 00:08:40,918
you know we we as johannas had Point has

223
00:08:37,639 --> 00:08:44,559
pointed out we can also kind of simplify

224
00:08:40,918 --> 00:08:47,600
the concept for how do we how do

225
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:49,439
we bring the the carbon and nutrients

226
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:51,159
that we in our food system back to the

227
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,640
soil and then back to our food and I

228
00:08:51,159 --> 00:08:57,079
think in some ways in some moments that

229
00:08:53,639 --> 00:08:59,679
allows us again to simplify in plus a

230
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:03,079
lot of this work is done by organisms

231
00:08:59,679 --> 00:09:05,838
so um it's while

232
00:09:03,078 --> 00:09:07,078
it's conceptually more complicated it's

233
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:09,200
technically a lot of times more easy

234
00:09:07,078 --> 00:09:12,039
because you're your various uh your

235
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:15,000
biologies doing the work for you okay so

236
00:09:12,039 --> 00:09:16,159
this is a while a minority of circular

237
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,720
economy literature it's still a very

238
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:21,799
happening literature um I don't know if

239
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:25,000
people remember aim doberman's talk here

240
00:09:21,799 --> 00:09:26,719
a few years back um so he's got

241
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:30,159
synthetic fertilizer as a foundation of

242
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:32,040
the circular food system or circular ish

243
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:35,278
food system but he's pointing out that

244
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:37,399
we could do much better about bringing

245
00:09:35,278 --> 00:09:39,360
hope products from animal and plant

246
00:09:37,399 --> 00:09:41,759
agriculture back into animal PL

247
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:43,079
agriculture but he notably sort of

248
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:46,078
wouldn't

249
00:09:43,078 --> 00:09:47,519
acknowledge excr in this Vision so

250
00:09:46,078 --> 00:09:51,439
johannas and I like call him up

251
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:52,959
afterward like a what's up with that um

252
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,519
he and I worked at the international R

253
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:58,518
Research Institute millions of years ago

254
00:09:54,519 --> 00:10:00,519
and we co-wrote sdg2 so I'm like aim

255
00:09:58,519 --> 00:10:02,600
this is not our first spute but he

256
00:10:00,519 --> 00:10:05,078
wasn't budging he's not ready for it he

257
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:07,360
is interested though in animal nutrients

258
00:10:05,078 --> 00:10:08,958
anyway uh johannas is working on him

259
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:12,959
stay tuned

260
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:14,958
um but so here is my you know kind of

261
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:18,759
simplified view of the the conventional

262
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:20,479
linear food system um we were I guess

263
00:10:18,759 --> 00:10:23,000
crops are around 70% dependent on

264
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:26,320
synthetic nitrogen at this point they go

265
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:28,600
through crops livestock and people your

266
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,920
veg or otherwise and we have these

267
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:32,600
massive

268
00:10:29,919 --> 00:10:36,919
byproducts crop residues animal and

269
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:39,600
human excreta and food waste and more um

270
00:10:36,919 --> 00:10:40,799
and then a lot of really hideous harms

271
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,240
deforestation because of the

272
00:10:40,799 --> 00:10:43,958
inefficiency of the system greenhouse

273
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:46,278
gases driving climate change nutrient

274
00:10:43,958 --> 00:10:50,599
pollution destroying our aquatic

275
00:10:46,278 --> 00:10:53,759
ecosystems um these are no joke if we're

276
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:56,000
looking at the planetary boundaries it's

277
00:10:53,759 --> 00:10:57,519
nutrient pollution and contaminants that

278
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,759
are kind of two of the

279
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:03,039
Blockbuster horrible things we need to

280
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:06,360
work on so I think we we are working on

281
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:07,759
them um and we need to be and I think

282
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:11,159
circularity is one of the ways we can

283
00:11:07,759 --> 00:11:13,519
improve here um so so if we look at

284
00:11:11,159 --> 00:11:16,559
these three byproducts of the food

285
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:20,000
system we just put in a paper from our

286
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:22,638
nefa team you know just in the USA alone

287
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,799
human and animal ex oppose a five plus

288
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:26,839
billion dollar a year

289
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:28,559
opportunity so I'm calling those the

290
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:30,600
organic underutilized resources just

291
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:32,638
because it sound

292
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:34,879
sounds kind of nice even though it's

293
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:36,839
slightly perverting the thing so how can

294
00:11:34,879 --> 00:11:38,559
we make use of those materials

295
00:11:36,839 --> 00:11:44,079
better

296
00:11:38,559 --> 00:11:47,159
um so doing anything as demanding as you

297
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:48,958
know circularizing the food system has

298
00:11:47,159 --> 00:11:51,759
has many Frontiers technical legal

299
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:53,159
regulatory operational sociocultural so

300
00:11:51,759 --> 00:11:56,639
starting where we are we're technical

301
00:11:53,159 --> 00:12:00,719
people well we can use if we're clever

302
00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:03,600
enough to use a a series of

303
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:06,240
transformation approaches together you

304
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,680
know we can turn those waste products

305
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,560
into resources there do some extent use

306
00:12:07,679 --> 00:12:13,719
these resources anyway already we could

307
00:12:09,559 --> 00:12:17,278
do a lot better um biological processes

308
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:19,560
like composting aerobic digestion like

309
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:21,278
soldierly larvey Livestock in general

310
00:12:19,559 --> 00:12:24,838
pigs and chickens and whatnot can

311
00:12:21,278 --> 00:12:29,519
transform these organic waste into into

312
00:12:24,839 --> 00:12:32,399
useful Foods those processes are just go

313
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:34,278
better with biochar every biology works

314
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:36,559
better with biochar and biochar works

315
00:12:34,278 --> 00:12:38,838
better if you've dried and chopped and

316
00:12:36,559 --> 00:12:40,638
you know pilled your material so how can

317
00:12:38,839 --> 00:12:42,920
we bring these together to more

318
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:45,919
efficiently um circularize the food

319
00:12:42,919 --> 00:12:47,278
system so um so we've got these three

320
00:12:45,919 --> 00:12:50,479
material Transformations and we're

321
00:12:47,278 --> 00:12:51,720
looking to turn a whole bunch of hours

322
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:54,399
including the three I've mentioned but

323
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:57,800
also invasive species agroindustrial

324
00:12:54,399 --> 00:13:01,278
products and uh byproducts and more into

325
00:12:57,799 --> 00:13:03,240
feed uh food fertilizer Etc soil

326
00:13:01,278 --> 00:13:05,078
amendments in order to improve food

327
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:07,600
security carbon sequestration reduce

328
00:13:05,078 --> 00:13:10,198
emissions provide sanitation improve

329
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:12,399
public health and employment in order to

330
00:13:10,198 --> 00:13:13,919
make all that happen we not only need

331
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:16,278
this sort of technical angle but we need

332
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:18,039
a lot of social um you know to really

333
00:13:16,278 --> 00:13:20,240
transform the food system we've got to

334
00:13:18,039 --> 00:13:24,039
change how we think and feel about

335
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:26,039
excreta another wayte how we process

336
00:13:24,039 --> 00:13:29,759
we're so centralized and these are low

337
00:13:26,039 --> 00:13:31,240
value gross messy things and centralized

338
00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:32,759
models really can't make any sense with

339
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:35,000
that and obviously there's a lot of

340
00:13:32,759 --> 00:13:38,958
legal regulatory change that needs to

341
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:40,919
happen to make this possible but um so

342
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:43,479
so we need to conceive of that luckily

343
00:13:40,919 --> 00:13:46,120
there's some nice synergies that can be

344
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:48,360
found amongst these methods carbon and

345
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:50,360
nutrients play nice together biochar and

346
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:51,919
biology as I mentioned if you start

347
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:53,560
co-localizing activities and

348
00:13:51,919 --> 00:13:55,000
coordinating sectors it can start to

349
00:13:53,559 --> 00:13:56,198
actually pick up speed and make sense we

350
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,480
have a lot of work to do to make all

351
00:13:56,198 --> 00:14:00,078
that happen but but you know it's it's

352
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,199
worth it I would

353
00:14:00,078 --> 00:14:04,958
so this is sort of

354
00:14:02,198 --> 00:14:06,719
a an eye full of what a circular version

355
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:08,919
would look like with maybe these

356
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:12,639
biological and thermochemical processes

357
00:14:08,919 --> 00:14:16,360
together making these um these waste

358
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:19,720
products sort of work for soil and crops

359
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:23,360
for people and and animals and including

360
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:27,480
insects um okay so so how did I come to

361
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:29,800
this uh this view of things priorities

362
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:32,600
this kind of summarizes why

363
00:14:29,799 --> 00:14:34,120
working in maze genetics and you know

364
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:35,560
there's only so much genetics can do

365
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:37,360
when you sort of look like that and acts

366
00:14:35,559 --> 00:14:39,000
like that and it's not only poor yield

367
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:41,079
but it's a poisonous yield that you get

368
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,720
when when it looks like that I really

369
00:14:41,078 --> 00:14:44,719
enjoyed those years of maze genetics

370
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:47,920
starting with trying to understand the

371
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:49,399
inheritance of a a suite of diseases

372
00:14:47,919 --> 00:14:51,679
that affect you

373
00:14:49,399 --> 00:14:53,559
know our major crop in the United States

374
00:14:51,679 --> 00:14:57,799
as well as in Africa got really sucked

375
00:14:53,559 --> 00:15:01,159
up in these ear diseases that um provide

376
00:14:57,799 --> 00:15:03,399
these pervasive toxic effects you know

377
00:15:01,159 --> 00:15:06,519
and how the specific traits of the ear

378
00:15:03,399 --> 00:15:08,958
and the plant determine uh resistance to

379
00:15:06,519 --> 00:15:12,799
those those uh fungal pathogens and

380
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:14,239
their microtox and um products so get a

381
00:15:12,799 --> 00:15:16,120
whole bunch of stuff on lot of genetics

382
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:18,799
and some grain sorting work and other

383
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:20,320
stuff um but I came to the view that

384
00:15:18,799 --> 00:15:21,879
there were a lot of trade-offs involved

385
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,320
so for genetics and breeding for grain

386
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:26,519
sorting and biological control there's

387
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:28,000
massive clear tradeoffs and the win-win

388
00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:29,198
that I could spot was enhancing soil

389
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,919
health and working with people to

390
00:15:29,198 --> 00:15:35,439
improve system

391
00:15:30,919 --> 00:15:37,759
Health just a couple of glimpses of our

392
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:41,600
results that are relevant a Kenyan

393
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:43,759
student um worked with a simit to look

394
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:46,959
at couple of places in eastern Kenya

395
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:49,399
just highlighting here the same season

396
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:51,239
low nitrogen and high nitrogen all the

397
00:15:49,399 --> 00:15:53,120
mot toxin indic the alot toxin

398
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:55,680
indicators here and also true for fum

399
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:57,679
monocenter are way worse with the low

400
00:15:55,679 --> 00:15:59,719
nitrogen than the high and looking over

401
00:15:57,679 --> 00:16:01,439
here at a different site

402
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:03,079
the low nitrogen looks a lot like the

403
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:06,720
low nitrogen here but with even more

404
00:16:03,078 --> 00:16:09,399
astronomical levels of Alin toxin um

405
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:12,680
then with an eye in the sky we could

406
00:16:09,399 --> 00:16:13,958
actually predict you know based on

407
00:16:12,679 --> 00:16:18,159
available

408
00:16:13,958 --> 00:16:20,758
scoil parameters and drought indicators

409
00:16:18,159 --> 00:16:22,759
we could predict to some extent alox and

410
00:16:20,759 --> 00:16:25,440
in a few surveys that we've published in

411
00:16:22,759 --> 00:16:27,519
these papers Will's paper came out right

412
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:29,720
before he lost his job usad

413
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:33,519
unfortunately um

414
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:36,040
but this made me feel like

415
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:38,000
uh toxic grain is a symptom of these

416
00:16:36,039 --> 00:16:39,879
larger challenges we've got soil

417
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,879
depletion and drought that come together

418
00:16:39,879 --> 00:16:45,039
to stress our plants and that leads to

419
00:16:41,879 --> 00:16:47,879
again poor yields and toxic yields um

420
00:16:45,039 --> 00:16:50,719
and what looked to me initially like a

421
00:16:47,879 --> 00:16:52,679
you know proud to be so integrated about

422
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:54,160
our microt toxin work to looking quite

423
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:56,838
inadequate you know we really have to go

424
00:16:54,159 --> 00:16:58,600
before the season and look at soil

425
00:16:56,839 --> 00:17:01,720
health and resilience after the season

426
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:02,839
to look at surveillance from um

427
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:06,360
satellite

428
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:09,439
data pop data but also bioindicators of

429
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:11,838
MOT toxins and it I started to feel like

430
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:14,079
we're we're strapping urine bags on

431
00:17:11,838 --> 00:17:18,119
babies and going to hospitals for for

432
00:17:14,078 --> 00:17:19,798
urinary athlex and biomarkers and like

433
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:21,519
wouldn't it be nice to have sour

434
00:17:19,798 --> 00:17:22,959
sanitation Source separating sanitation

435
00:17:21,519 --> 00:17:24,679
that could also contribute to a

436
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:26,679
surveillance program so I end up

437
00:17:24,679 --> 00:17:28,360
thinking well shoot if we're got to I've

438
00:17:26,679 --> 00:17:31,440
got to handle the urine anyway why would

439
00:17:28,359 --> 00:17:33,399
I do it in a baby bag why not you know

440
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:35,759
do it as part of an integrated circular

441
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:39,840
system where the we we're monitoring the

442
00:17:35,759 --> 00:17:42,599
crop the the food and the the body and

443
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:43,558
we're using the body product again to to

444
00:17:42,599 --> 00:17:47,399
fight the

445
00:17:43,558 --> 00:17:49,798
problem so so how can we build that soil

446
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:51,600
Health where can we get that so a carbon

447
00:17:49,798 --> 00:17:54,038
and nutrients I think you can probably

448
00:17:51,599 --> 00:17:56,599
guess where I'm going with that um so

449
00:17:54,038 --> 00:17:59,519
back to those people in n in

450
00:17:56,599 --> 00:18:00,839
ner um I was really proud that my

451
00:17:59,519 --> 00:18:02,720
program was funding this farmer

452
00:18:00,839 --> 00:18:05,480
organization and supporting them not

453
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:06,640
only to come up with I mean they didn't

454
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:08,279
we didn't support them to come up with

455
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:10,600
the idea they came up with well yes we

456
00:18:08,279 --> 00:18:13,200
did we got an agronomist talking to the

457
00:18:10,599 --> 00:18:15,558
farmer leadership who suggested Ur as an

458
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:17,640
alternative it was not popular initially

459
00:18:15,558 --> 00:18:19,720
but after a few years hundreds of

460
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:21,120
farmers are using urine as a fertilizer

461
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:23,319
and they're able to publish their

462
00:18:21,119 --> 00:18:24,879
results with this the first author there

463
00:18:23,319 --> 00:18:27,319
is a young woman that is not a normal

464
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:29,600
thing in that culture but so I was real

465
00:18:27,319 --> 00:18:31,000
proud of how that worked out so this

466
00:18:29,599 --> 00:18:33,678
inspired a lot of other people to at

467
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:38,240
least consider that the film that my my

468
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:41,080
uh son made was um prompted by be Beth

469
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:45,880
mcki a graduate from this

470
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:47,839
department um Janice no sir and um she

471
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:49,919
Beth brought that video to East Africa

472
00:18:47,839 --> 00:18:51,558
to to Lobby the farmers in the East

473
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:54,200
Africa to consider these findings and

474
00:18:51,558 --> 00:18:55,480
you know slowo but making progress um

475
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:57,679
and then this is another thing I was

476
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:59,120
pleased but from my mcnight I was a

477
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:02,480
scientific director for couple of

478
00:18:59,119 --> 00:19:04,719
decades and that n this that ner work

479
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:06,400
was something like and I more in

480
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:09,079
response to that I asked this other

481
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:11,759
group to I worked with them to get them

482
00:19:09,079 --> 00:19:12,960
a grant and they're looking here in

483
00:19:11,759 --> 00:19:16,000
another West African country this is

484
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:18,079
Burkina Faso this is aagadu sort of the

485
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,119
Agricultural area around it in a broader

486
00:19:18,079 --> 00:19:23,240
Bina they bring in a bunch of nutrients

487
00:19:20,119 --> 00:19:26,558
into wagadugu from you know the

488
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:29,960
Hinterlands and then they say your

489
00:19:26,558 --> 00:19:32,440
nation constitutes that's uh major

490
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:33,880
uncontrolled nitrogen flow is by far the

491
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:35,279
fattest Arrow coming out of there

492
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:36,960
urination this is from the end of the

493
00:19:35,279 --> 00:19:39,440
abstract urination constitutes a

494
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:40,880
dominant nitrogen loss pathway and urine

495
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:43,000
collecting initiatives could provide

496
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:44,360
valuable fertilizer adapted to local

497
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,599
agricultural requirements and

498
00:19:44,359 --> 00:19:48,240
constraints increasing the urban system

499
00:19:46,599 --> 00:19:49,798
sustainability by enhancing Regional

500
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:52,679
food provision as well as reducing

501
00:19:49,798 --> 00:19:54,240
sanitation induced water pollution so

502
00:19:52,679 --> 00:19:55,440
that the first author was a guy I

503
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:59,240
learned a lot from when I was on

504
00:19:55,440 --> 00:20:02,720
sabbatic in France um and appreciate the

505
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:06,038
way they sort of work this out um so it

506
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:08,480
isn't just you know West Africa um

507
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:11,720
there's Dynamic this is sort of very old

508
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:14,038
idea and you know pleasing government

509
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:15,759
and Grandma you know the idea of

510
00:20:14,038 --> 00:20:18,400
projecting the beauty of bodily

511
00:20:15,759 --> 00:20:20,679
circulation and pro projecting the

512
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:22,759
practicality of it you know why the heck

513
00:20:20,679 --> 00:20:24,798
we can't do that and spare no

514
00:20:22,759 --> 00:20:26,798
accumulation of phosphorus nitrogen and

515
00:20:24,798 --> 00:20:28,918
carbon compounds in our waterways so

516
00:20:26,798 --> 00:20:32,319
this is nothing new we're just trying to

517
00:20:28,919 --> 00:20:34,200
gain momentum here um hard to do in the

518
00:20:32,319 --> 00:20:35,960
United States for some reason but when

519
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:40,200
the conflict started in

520
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:42,159
Ukraine now three years back um I got

521
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:45,240
interest from a a New York Times

522
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:47,679
Reporter who's a friend of my kids and

523
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:50,319
um she wrote that article about peace

524
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:52,400
cyclers there immediately spawned a rash

525
00:20:50,319 --> 00:20:54,119
of other propaganda I mean other

526
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:57,320
articles in

527
00:20:54,119 --> 00:21:00,439
various I shouldn't say that but one of

528
00:20:57,319 --> 00:21:02,200
them was about the work in ner which I

529
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:03,720
was really pleased about that anyway so

530
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:05,240
so this is sort of becomes part of my

531
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:06,679
mindset how do we make change partly

532
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:10,120
it's sort of getting our fabulous work

533
00:21:06,679 --> 00:21:13,559
into into the news um okay

534
00:21:10,119 --> 00:21:16,558
so um what are we up to around this

535
00:21:13,558 --> 00:21:19,879
around here um so if you think about P

536
00:21:16,558 --> 00:21:22,639
you can either use it as is but it's

537
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:24,919
heavy and you know low

538
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:28,000
value or you can make it into a fancier

539
00:21:24,919 --> 00:21:29,600
fertilizer so if johanes and I John he

540
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,480
represents this soide more and I'm more

541
00:21:29,599 --> 00:21:36,759
over here but we both are fans of both I

542
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:40,079
suppose um so my thinking about the the

543
00:21:36,759 --> 00:21:42,079
just using p as is was really focused on

544
00:21:40,079 --> 00:21:45,038
an interest in that per Urban population

545
00:21:42,079 --> 00:21:47,278
so 40% of humanity lives in per urban

546
00:21:45,038 --> 00:21:50,960
areas many of these people are living in

547
00:21:47,278 --> 00:21:52,759
slums informal settlements these per

548
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:54,798
urban areas are like too dense maybe to

549
00:21:52,759 --> 00:21:57,278
farm but here there's some space to grow

550
00:21:54,798 --> 00:21:59,359
things you're told to go you know

551
00:21:57,278 --> 00:22:01,319
implement this kind of garden

552
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:03,399
but then the soil people have access to

553
00:22:01,319 --> 00:22:05,839
it's full of heavy metals can we use

554
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:07,559
crop residues together with excr to be

555
00:22:05,839 --> 00:22:10,558
able to do this but

556
00:22:07,558 --> 00:22:12,558
safely um so I started with straw Bell

557
00:22:10,558 --> 00:22:14,879
gardening because it's kind of a

558
00:22:12,558 --> 00:22:16,440
thing I'm calling it grow as you go or

559
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:20,559
you go gardening because of the P

560
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:23,400
component I loved my my Musgrave Farm

561
00:22:20,558 --> 00:22:24,839
manager for support not only tolerating

562
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:26,840
but supporting me to get going on this

563
00:22:24,839 --> 00:22:29,798
while I was trying to be you know the

564
00:22:26,839 --> 00:22:31,879
maze genetics continues um you know you

565
00:22:29,798 --> 00:22:33,558
might might not have seen the somewhat

566
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:37,440
mediocre straw Bell gardening there at

567
00:22:33,558 --> 00:22:38,839
Caldwell as well um so that was sort of

568
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:42,320
exploratory then then we sort of shift

569
00:22:38,839 --> 00:22:44,599
into more experimental mode here um my

570
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:47,639
must grave Farm manager introduced me to

571
00:22:44,599 --> 00:22:48,798
the uh dilman Hill Farm managers with

572
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:51,600
the hint that that was a much more

573
00:22:48,798 --> 00:22:53,960
appropriate place to work dilman Hill

574
00:22:51,599 --> 00:22:56,199
has a legacy of heavy metals from its

575
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:59,600
time as a Orchard piece of the orchard

576
00:22:56,200 --> 00:23:02,120
where they're using um arsenic and Leed

577
00:22:59,599 --> 00:23:04,839
as you know as as pesticides in the

578
00:23:02,119 --> 00:23:07,479
orchard business so you know working on

579
00:23:04,839 --> 00:23:09,599
raised bed gardens are similar um makes

580
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:12,159
a lot of sense there psychically and the

581
00:23:09,599 --> 00:23:15,158
student environment is great there um

582
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:15,159
Jesse's here somewhere I

583
00:23:15,759 --> 00:23:20,359
think um so just a couple of messages

584
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:23,519
from that work so far I'm sort of

585
00:23:20,359 --> 00:23:27,319
leaning on 20 2023 and 2024 findings

586
00:23:23,519 --> 00:23:30,879
from our dman Hill machine um first off

587
00:23:27,319 --> 00:23:33,158
um plant um you know the the kale in

588
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:35,880
2023 grew um

589
00:23:33,159 --> 00:23:39,360
similarly um with urine as with Miracle

590
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:42,480
Grow on soil so Ur is good fertilizer up

591
00:23:39,359 --> 00:23:46,599
to a point um but our our substrates

592
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:49,480
really suck so this is wheat straw oh

593
00:23:46,599 --> 00:23:51,759
not so good um really bad With Ur way

594
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:53,480
better way worse than with Miracle Grow

595
00:23:51,759 --> 00:23:57,038
but in general Miracle going year on our

596
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:58,919
par on Ma over and on soil but our

597
00:23:57,038 --> 00:24:02,599
organic substrates are looking really

598
00:23:58,919 --> 00:24:04,799
not competitive here Jensen there um so

599
00:24:02,599 --> 00:24:07,119
we did a little experiment mixing up you

600
00:24:04,798 --> 00:24:08,720
little comparing virgin wheat that was

601
00:24:07,119 --> 00:24:09,918
in the barn with weathered wheed that

602
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:11,919
was sitting around outside for a year or

603
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:15,000
so with composted wheat that we' used

604
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:17,919
for the straw gardening with fine Stover

605
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:20,240
and a mix of those two and um within

606
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:22,278
without biochar here um and and

607
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:25,599
basically you have to kind of age you

608
00:24:22,278 --> 00:24:27,440
know the wheat quite a bit to get to

609
00:24:25,599 --> 00:24:30,199
what fine Stover is on day one out of

610
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:32,880
the barn um and there's sort of a hint

611
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:36,159
there not significant but maybe blending

612
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:40,640
is better no biochar effect

613
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:41,520
detected um we uh the regulatory

614
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:43,480
authorities thought it was going to be

615
00:24:41,519 --> 00:24:45,079
World War III when we applied urine on

616
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:46,278
the plant science Barn after a

617
00:24:45,079 --> 00:24:48,599
considerable struggle with the

618
00:24:46,278 --> 00:24:51,278
authorities and and after a tough start

619
00:24:48,599 --> 00:24:53,439
for the for the best guest hour

620
00:24:51,278 --> 00:24:55,480
substrate which is now mix of composted

621
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:58,159
wheat compost and different levels of

622
00:24:55,480 --> 00:25:00,880
biochar we actually came out on part

623
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:04,360
like head of the commercial potting mix

624
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:06,600
across that trial and looked like it no

625
00:25:04,359 --> 00:25:08,479
World War III really you don't smell P

626
00:25:06,599 --> 00:25:10,319
after like the first imediate

627
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:11,679
application if you put it on a soil or

628
00:25:10,319 --> 00:25:15,158
soil likee

629
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:17,038
substrate okay so so generally P works

630
00:25:15,159 --> 00:25:20,080
well our hours work well if you blend

631
00:25:17,038 --> 00:25:22,720
them right um so we're trying to kind of

632
00:25:20,079 --> 00:25:25,519
hit bionutrient circulated against

633
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:27,558
conventional they've got the high yields

634
00:25:25,519 --> 00:25:29,319
we've got these other arguments they've

635
00:25:27,558 --> 00:25:30,918
got a lot of you know the dings on them

636
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:34,158
that I mentioned in the

637
00:25:30,919 --> 00:25:35,600
downsides uh presentation but we got a

638
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:36,840
bunch of downsides too and one of them

639
00:25:35,599 --> 00:25:39,199
might be that there's a lot of salt in

640
00:25:36,839 --> 00:25:40,519
our diets and therefore in our urine so

641
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:42,960
there's a bunch of other problems as

642
00:25:40,519 --> 00:25:46,038
well so hitting the salt here I'm just

643
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:48,840
looking at the kale tissue yeah the kale

644
00:25:46,038 --> 00:25:52,038
came out saltier on Weeds more so on the

645
00:25:48,839 --> 00:25:55,798
hours than on the soil the substrates

646
00:25:52,038 --> 00:25:58,759
came out saltier on the hours and also

647
00:25:55,798 --> 00:26:01,038
on the soil um but would really have a

648
00:25:58,759 --> 00:26:02,759
big effect on the yield we're doing some

649
00:26:01,038 --> 00:26:04,319
wash out experiments I'll mention here

650
00:26:02,759 --> 00:26:06,599
so this last year we did three different

651
00:26:04,319 --> 00:26:08,359
experiment a lettuce a tomato and a

652
00:26:06,599 --> 00:26:09,398
lettuce experiment I'm sorry showing the

653
00:26:08,359 --> 00:26:10,599
Tomato because I won't say anything

654
00:26:09,398 --> 00:26:12,278
further about that for the moment but

655
00:26:10,599 --> 00:26:17,319
just to show that on this incredibly

656
00:26:12,278 --> 00:26:20,640
badl looking mix of wheat straw ma

657
00:26:17,319 --> 00:26:23,278
rudely CH ma right off the combine and

658
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:25,240
so some compost plus minus biochar the

659
00:26:23,278 --> 00:26:27,038
plants really are pretty indifferent I

660
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:28,839
mean they're just they're they're quite

661
00:26:27,038 --> 00:26:32,679
competitive with soil which is totally

662
00:26:28,839 --> 00:26:34,319
weird and unexpected um so again we're

663
00:26:32,679 --> 00:26:37,600
we're benchmarking well in terms of

664
00:26:34,319 --> 00:26:39,398
lettuce yield soil's a little worse off

665
00:26:37,599 --> 00:26:41,439
here probably because we overdose the

666
00:26:39,398 --> 00:26:42,798
synthetic a little sorry the synthetic

667
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:44,600
on soil because I think we did a little

668
00:26:42,798 --> 00:26:46,319
initial overdosing but you can see that

669
00:26:44,599 --> 00:26:51,000
it's growing quite well urine versus

670
00:26:46,319 --> 00:26:53,439
Miracle Grow here um so looking now at

671
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:55,200
um water flush level we'd put up the

672
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:56,960
high tunnel at dilman so we could manage

673
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:59,640
the water trying to explore this issue

674
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:02,038
of what about the salt levels and so

675
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:04,600
this is the first lettuce season on the

676
00:27:02,038 --> 00:27:06,640
organic underutilized resources more

677
00:27:04,599 --> 00:27:10,599
water is better more water is better on

678
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:13,038
hours on soil and this is sorry on I I

679
00:27:10,599 --> 00:27:14,398
screwed that up did I no oh sorry urine

680
00:27:13,038 --> 00:27:18,679
synthetic

681
00:27:14,398 --> 00:27:20,759
nutrient um our soil our soil so the the

682
00:27:18,679 --> 00:27:23,399
urine is doing sort of better overall

683
00:27:20,759 --> 00:27:27,119
and more waterers better so is it a salt

684
00:27:23,398 --> 00:27:29,879
thing um it seems like not as far as we

685
00:27:27,119 --> 00:27:31,599
can tell um this is the one of the few

686
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:33,159
cases where we get a biochar effect

687
00:27:31,599 --> 00:27:34,759
because usually we're not stressing it

688
00:27:33,159 --> 00:27:36,679
it seems biochar steps to the rescue

689
00:27:34,759 --> 00:27:38,960
apparently when there's either water

690
00:27:36,679 --> 00:27:41,240
nutrient or other or too much ammonia

691
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:43,159
stress in this case this is the low

692
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:45,480
flush medium and High flush different

693
00:27:43,159 --> 00:27:49,278
amounts of water per 20 lit

694
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:50,798
sack and um the urine treatment I

695
00:27:49,278 --> 00:27:53,919
thought would be getting better over the

696
00:27:50,798 --> 00:27:57,240
time but with no biochar it's getting

697
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:59,080
worse by this third season and it's much

698
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:01,200
worse with Ohio wash out so maybe the

699
00:27:59,079 --> 00:28:05,079
biochar is just holding nutrients for

700
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:08,120
that um for that crop when the high wash

701
00:28:05,079 --> 00:28:12,359
out is just washing nutrients out of the

702
00:28:08,119 --> 00:28:14,158
this is all the hours so um anyway

703
00:28:12,359 --> 00:28:16,158
that's the the only significant effect

704
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:19,080
here but it is quite striking that our

705
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:20,519
third season the third season with this

706
00:28:19,079 --> 00:28:22,960
set of same set of sacks are starting to

707
00:28:20,519 --> 00:28:26,120
look pretty pretty shabby with urine so

708
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:28,880
there's something something is maybe um

709
00:28:26,119 --> 00:28:30,359
there's something that we need to amend

710
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:31,799
possibly those micronutrients that are

711
00:28:30,359 --> 00:28:33,519
initially supplied by the organic

712
00:28:31,798 --> 00:28:36,440
materials and they're not adequately

713
00:28:33,519 --> 00:28:40,319
provided in the in the

714
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:42,679
urine anyway so glad that Jesse's here

715
00:28:40,319 --> 00:28:45,158
because he and colleagues and Christina

716
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:47,278
we're also exploring this idea that that

717
00:28:45,159 --> 00:28:49,679
we can frame this issue as a matter of

718
00:28:47,278 --> 00:28:51,159
nutrient sovereignty for people for whom

719
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:53,240
that concept is Meaningful so the new

720
00:28:51,159 --> 00:28:56,519
our buddies in New York feel like that

721
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:59,000
kind of resonates with them the um black

722
00:28:56,519 --> 00:29:02,159
gardeners um organiz ation they like

723
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:05,880
that concept apparently and um so this

724
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:09,039
is an experiment with some uh

725
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:10,679
indigenously uh crops of interest to the

726
00:29:09,038 --> 00:29:13,640
indigenous students that Jesse's

727
00:29:10,679 --> 00:29:16,759
representing and um that's uh skunk

728
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:19,200
beans and tobac and uh ceremonial

729
00:29:16,759 --> 00:29:21,558
tobacco and these are urine plus or

730
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:26,159
minus would urine and synthetic plus or

731
00:29:21,558 --> 00:29:28,798
minus uh uh wood vinegar and we testing

732
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:31,120
other other fertig against fish effluent

733
00:29:28,798 --> 00:29:34,918
from the aquaculture Enterprise FR from

734
00:29:31,119 --> 00:29:37,278
the Black soldierly Enterprise and the

735
00:29:34,919 --> 00:29:40,200
the tobacco showed a strong yield effect

736
00:29:37,278 --> 00:29:43,200
um where synthetic and urine were fine

737
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:44,519
and these others were not um beans did

738
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:47,840
not show a strong yield effect but they

739
00:29:44,519 --> 00:29:50,720
showed a very strong uh protein content

740
00:29:47,839 --> 00:29:52,759
effect per nitrogen effect so um I

741
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:56,720
thought that was quite interesting and

742
00:29:52,759 --> 00:29:58,038
um notable that the these pale plants

743
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:00,000
you know clearly weren't getting

744
00:29:58,038 --> 00:30:02,839
nutrient Le treatments the fish I flu

745
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:05,038
and fr um and they they responded by

746
00:30:02,839 --> 00:30:07,720
just having more carbohydrates and less

747
00:30:05,038 --> 00:30:09,879
protein um so anyway going forward we're

748
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:12,839
looking at how different ingredients

749
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:14,919
especially non ours the biochar the

750
00:30:12,839 --> 00:30:16,759
mineral component that we could dope in

751
00:30:14,919 --> 00:30:18,360
there and fertig can influence the

752
00:30:16,759 --> 00:30:20,079
biology the chemistry and the physics of

753
00:30:18,359 --> 00:30:22,119
the situation we're looking at um

754
00:30:20,079 --> 00:30:25,639
Christina's leading work on nematodes

755
00:30:22,119 --> 00:30:27,518
and fungi uh Forest is working work with

756
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:31,080
uh Steve vanic on ecoplates to look at

757
00:30:27,519 --> 00:30:32,519
the bacteria populations and communities

758
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:34,158
better understanding the chemical

759
00:30:32,519 --> 00:30:36,519
situations here and some of the physical

760
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:38,360
Transformations that occur um size

761
00:30:36,519 --> 00:30:41,880
particle distribution shifts and how

762
00:30:38,359 --> 00:30:42,959
they occur um so so we're excited about

763
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:45,278
some of the experiments we have on

764
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:49,079
greenhouse gases in in particular now in

765
00:30:45,278 --> 00:30:50,640
this this uh in this winter um

766
00:30:49,079 --> 00:30:52,798
Christina's done a bit of work on that

767
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:54,519
on a larger scale thinking here about

768
00:30:52,798 --> 00:30:56,359
how com what are the implications for

769
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:58,599
these matters when you're looking at

770
00:30:56,359 --> 00:30:59,839
composting a domestic and Municipal

771
00:30:58,599 --> 00:31:01,278
scales which is a big deal because

772
00:30:59,839 --> 00:31:03,480
legally you have to compost if you're

773
00:31:01,278 --> 00:31:05,480
big operation New York State Vermont

774
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:08,440
everybody has to compost everything

775
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:11,079
organic and uh it's not going to be all

776
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:13,000
Yugo gardening um do we have

777
00:31:11,079 --> 00:31:14,918
implications for for larger scale

778
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:19,839
composting and here Christina is

779
00:31:14,919 --> 00:31:23,000
comparing um leaves uh without biochar

780
00:31:19,839 --> 00:31:26,038
fertigated with water or urine leaves

781
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:28,278
with 5% biochar water and urine and you

782
00:31:26,038 --> 00:31:30,038
can see that without biochar urine is

783
00:31:28,278 --> 00:31:32,398
getting a lot more nitrous oxide

784
00:31:30,038 --> 00:31:34,960
powerful greenhouse gas and that's not

785
00:31:32,398 --> 00:31:37,239
the case when the 5% biochar is there so

786
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:41,240
this is very preliminary

787
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:44,278
a b uh it's also expected based on the

788
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:47,519
literature C I think it could be a big

789
00:31:44,278 --> 00:31:50,200
deal because I'm a master

790
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:51,880
composter um I didn't hear word one

791
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:53,720
about B Char the entire Master

792
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:57,039
composting training you

793
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:59,038
know and I feel like yeah we should be

794
00:31:57,038 --> 00:32:00,798
jamice we got to make put this in here

795
00:31:59,038 --> 00:32:02,240
and we know that composting can lead to

796
00:32:00,798 --> 00:32:04,000
high greenhouse gas emissions especially

797
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:06,440
you start using urine which I'm pushing

798
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:09,119
for but biochar mineral additives can

799
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:11,440
reduce ghd production during composting

800
00:32:09,119 --> 00:32:14,000
this again is you know somewhat

801
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:15,720
established not not to Gene bone and

802
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:18,798
satisfaction apparently but we learned

803
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:21,038
about green green brown green right

804
00:32:18,798 --> 00:32:22,798
green green and brown composting

805
00:32:21,038 --> 00:32:25,119
sandwiches I think it should be black

806
00:32:22,798 --> 00:32:27,879
and gold you

807
00:32:25,119 --> 00:32:28,959
know that's my serial residues anyway so

808
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:31,720
I think there are practical implications

809
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:33,159
there that we could work on um and and

810
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:35,120
we are sort of reaching into the

811
00:32:33,159 --> 00:32:38,159
community with our Yugo gardening at the

812
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:41,158
soil Factory these are PE powered raised

813
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:43,799
beds with yard waist and whatever we've

814
00:32:41,159 --> 00:32:45,840
got stuffed inside we put urine around

815
00:32:43,798 --> 00:32:48,000
the we frame it in straw bales and put

816
00:32:45,839 --> 00:32:50,079
Ur on the straw bales and then between

817
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:52,278
Seasons dump that now onto the garden

818
00:32:50,079 --> 00:32:56,678
and rebuild it with new straw

819
00:32:52,278 --> 00:33:00,960
bales um nice indigenous

820
00:32:56,679 --> 00:33:03,200
um uh gardening component to that really

821
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:04,759
nicely um and then this is sort of some

822
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:08,720
of those same types of gardens up here

823
00:33:04,759 --> 00:33:10,599
at the dilman hill D an organic farm um

824
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:14,839
again because it's suitable because of

825
00:33:10,599 --> 00:33:17,158
that contaminated soil Legacy um we you

826
00:33:14,839 --> 00:33:18,759
know leasing with our friends and family

827
00:33:17,159 --> 00:33:21,840
down in New York to see you know does

828
00:33:18,759 --> 00:33:23,398
this have implications for green cities

829
00:33:21,839 --> 00:33:25,798
they're interested in using biochar in

830
00:33:23,398 --> 00:33:27,839
the Bronx and that it's quy Joseph's

831
00:33:25,798 --> 00:33:30,038
terms so I think we we' got a nice

832
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:31,000
collaboration sort of inching forward in

833
00:33:30,038 --> 00:33:33,679
that

834
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:35,558
regard anyway so how about

835
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:37,679
contaminants

836
00:33:35,558 --> 00:33:39,359
um I'm not going to say much about it

837
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:40,880
but there is some emerging literature

838
00:33:39,359 --> 00:33:42,719
people often ask you know what about

839
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:43,600
pharmaceuticals we take in a lot they

840
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:45,360
come out you know just like our

841
00:33:43,599 --> 00:33:48,240
nutrients come out our P so do our

842
00:33:45,359 --> 00:33:50,558
Pharma anyway there's in uh some initial

843
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:52,679
indication from other groups that this

844
00:33:50,558 --> 00:33:55,440
uh High nitrogen fertilizer value and

845
00:33:52,679 --> 00:33:57,080
low uptake of Pharma it's probably not

846
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:59,519
fair to just leave it at that but I will

847
00:33:57,079 --> 00:34:03,199
leave it at that now um I did spend a

848
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:05,159
year working on this n National's panel

849
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:07,000
about exploring linkages between soil

850
00:34:05,159 --> 00:34:08,679
Health and Human Health and

851
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,280
contamination was one of the big themes

852
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:12,079
that came out there so that gave me a

853
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:13,919
chance to kind of get on the boards with

854
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:16,079
my mot toxin point the links between

855
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:17,279
soil health and mot toxins this point

856
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:19,839
about

857
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:22,760
excreta but you know just this issue of

858
00:34:19,838 --> 00:34:24,159
of contaminants is huge in soil Health

859
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:26,000
more broadly nothing you know with or

860
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:29,398
without you know anything to do with M

861
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:32,199
with what I'm talking about today and um

862
00:34:29,398 --> 00:34:34,719
yet this circularity will only compound

863
00:34:32,199 --> 00:34:36,918
those concerns um and I just want to

864
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:39,239
point out that one of the the raay of

865
00:34:36,918 --> 00:34:43,158
hope that our committee found was that

866
00:34:39,239 --> 00:34:47,439
paralysis in my primitive realization

867
00:34:43,159 --> 00:34:49,519
here in a contiki um the of any at any

868
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:51,159
scale the process of you know heating

869
00:34:49,519 --> 00:34:54,800
material Organics at really high

870
00:34:51,159 --> 00:34:58,039
temperatures can break Bonds in organic

871
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:59,680
contaminants your Pharma your P even and

872
00:34:58,039 --> 00:35:01,480
also the product is helpful in

873
00:34:59,679 --> 00:35:04,039
immobilizing the same bad things

874
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:05,960
including you know non non-organic

875
00:35:04,039 --> 00:35:07,199
contaminants heavy metals and stuff so

876
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:08,519
so this is something that I think is

877
00:35:07,199 --> 00:35:10,598
important in that

878
00:35:08,519 --> 00:35:13,000
regard so

879
00:35:10,599 --> 00:35:14,960
oops um I wanted to update you a bit

880
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:17,119
also about what I'm most excited about

881
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:19,280
which is what what we've got going on in

882
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:21,440
Kenya both in Rural and in urban

883
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:23,800
contexts so I'm bringing you here to the

884
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:26,079
Republic of Kenya and it's little corner

885
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:28,839
of Lake Victoria so that's Lake Victoria

886
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:30,880
the Kenyon corner has this little pinch

887
00:35:28,838 --> 00:35:33,119
off thing called the nans go where

888
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:35,240
you're getting increasing likelihood of

889
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:36,760
harmful algal blooms as you get a little

890
00:35:35,239 --> 00:35:38,439
piece of the lake pinched off you can

891
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:40,440
see that they're they're becoming

892
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:42,800
increasingly likely wherever People Meet

893
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:45,920
the lake so land and Lake not friends

894
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:48,560
here a simplest thing you could do is

895
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:51,760
just put pee on the farms so so this is

896
00:35:48,559 --> 00:35:53,358
going on in our in mumas here so I'll

897
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:56,160
start at mumas and then take us down to

898
00:35:53,358 --> 00:35:58,759
the city um but the farmers were not

899
00:35:56,159 --> 00:36:01,480
super Keen they thought that was gross

900
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:03,079
um when we discussed all the possible

901
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:04,679
things you can do if you're able to sore

902
00:36:03,079 --> 00:36:06,920
separate urine you can put on your crop

903
00:36:04,679 --> 00:36:09,318
on your raised bed your compost or you

904
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:12,318
make this nice fertilizer they were down

905
00:36:09,318 --> 00:36:14,358
with a compost angle they they know they

906
00:36:12,318 --> 00:36:15,960
need to improve their soils they're

907
00:36:14,358 --> 00:36:17,480
making compost and they're like okay

908
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:19,880
with the idea of doping it up with their

909
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:22,318
bodily nutrients they got super pumped

910
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:24,800
about this if you're in mumas now and

911
00:36:22,318 --> 00:36:26,559
you pee you're a kid and you pee here or

912
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:28,359
there like you always used to do you are

913
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:32,480
in trouble because you need to be

914
00:36:28,358 --> 00:36:35,759
gathering that up for your crops so

915
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:38,719
they're big into the um composting they

916
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:41,359
they form a farmer research Network um

917
00:36:38,719 --> 00:36:45,039
they've got formal experiments informal

918
00:36:41,358 --> 00:36:46,799
experiments um the the farmer leader

919
00:36:45,039 --> 00:36:48,880
Haron here still wearing his badge from

920
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:53,318
our C Ben meeting

921
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:55,599
um um he he dug out all the pitet trees

922
00:36:53,318 --> 00:36:57,279
and he included the material oh I know

923
00:36:55,599 --> 00:36:59,440
as a way out of of me I'm like also not

924
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:02,280
having about that but it worked great I

925
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:05,559
got to say anyway they're going gang

926
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:09,040
busters and moving back to kumu on that

927
00:37:05,559 --> 00:37:11,759
nansa Gulf um we got excited about the

928
00:37:09,039 --> 00:37:13,400
you know hot quenched there's some

929
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:16,079
evidence from the literature that hot

930
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:17,760
quenched um biochars performs

931
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:20,000
particularly well so it's going be hot

932
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:23,119
quenching um in three years of

933
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:24,760
experiments the the P quench biochar was

934
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:27,119
performing with the chemical fertilizer

935
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:29,400
against the water quenched and control

936
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:30,358
and you know we want to improve the

937
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:34,039
rigor

938
00:37:30,358 --> 00:37:35,559
and uh design of these experiments but

939
00:37:34,039 --> 00:37:37,239
you know we're we're encouraged by the

940
00:37:35,559 --> 00:37:39,880
fact that that this stuff is performing

941
00:37:37,239 --> 00:37:42,358
well so far and and what we want to take

942
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:44,280
it bigger now henya is the home for the

943
00:37:42,358 --> 00:37:46,318
biggest sour Sebring Sanitation Company

944
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:48,760
in the world cergy they serve as over

945
00:37:46,318 --> 00:37:50,679
150 plus PE thousand plus people in

946
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:52,599
Nairobi they make

947
00:37:50,679 --> 00:37:54,399
fertilizers and other and black soldier

948
00:37:52,599 --> 00:37:58,318
flies and other products from the poop

949
00:37:54,400 --> 00:38:00,358
there they dump the pee um so they're

950
00:37:58,318 --> 00:38:02,559
already showing that you can tie up

951
00:38:00,358 --> 00:38:05,719
sanitation and fertilizer production

952
00:38:02,559 --> 00:38:09,519
there to some extent and they've got a

953
00:38:05,719 --> 00:38:12,959
sub uh whatever a a branch that's moved

954
00:38:09,519 --> 00:38:14,838
out to kisuma in Western Kenya uh and

955
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:17,240
this is their fact toilet Factory on the

956
00:38:14,838 --> 00:38:19,639
on the wastewater treatment plant um

957
00:38:17,239 --> 00:38:23,399
territory they also have in the same

958
00:38:19,639 --> 00:38:25,118
town you know really vibrant uh

959
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:29,240
Community Based organization called Kia

960
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:32,240
Kum kisumu Young agripreneurs that's um

961
00:38:29,239 --> 00:38:34,879
Roy who runs it and they've got black

962
00:38:32,239 --> 00:38:38,959
soldier flies producing all these AG

963
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:41,480
inputs and consolidating product and so

964
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:44,480
you know obviously I had a bright idea

965
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:47,639
that they could team up so last time I

966
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:50,280
was in Kenya uh we all came to the table

967
00:38:47,639 --> 00:38:52,118
our dining room table at our Shack there

968
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:56,079
um so that's Florence who runs Fresh

969
00:38:52,119 --> 00:38:58,960
Life in kisumu that's uh Roy who runs at

970
00:38:56,079 --> 00:39:02,079
Kia that's Charles dega my my big

971
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:04,039
collaborator uh this this individual is

972
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:09,519
paid by Johannes to coordinate the

973
00:39:04,039 --> 00:39:13,559
regional circular B economy Network Eric

974
00:39:09,519 --> 00:39:16,440
Bala that's uh you may know Bella from

975
00:39:13,559 --> 00:39:18,639
from here who also co-runs that that

976
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:21,960
Network um and they're like heck yeah

977
00:39:18,639 --> 00:39:26,358
let's do it so so here's that map

978
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:29,159
of the neanda informal settlement SLO

979
00:39:26,358 --> 00:39:31,679
there um

980
00:39:29,159 --> 00:39:33,519
uh reaching out to the the water body

981
00:39:31,679 --> 00:39:35,639
there the wastewater treatment plan and

982
00:39:33,519 --> 00:39:39,719
agriculture here and the more middle

983
00:39:35,639 --> 00:39:41,838
class neighborhood here so Florence

984
00:39:39,719 --> 00:39:44,679
provided the the

985
00:39:41,838 --> 00:39:48,039
GPS uh locations of all the toilets they

986
00:39:44,679 --> 00:39:50,159
service in this slum neighborhood and um

987
00:39:48,039 --> 00:39:51,880
Keith at man Library helped me map it

988
00:39:50,159 --> 00:39:54,838
and I you can see the different

989
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:56,318
collection paths so we we can choose you

990
00:39:54,838 --> 00:39:58,599
know and take as many of these

991
00:39:56,318 --> 00:40:01,039
collection paths as we want for for our

992
00:39:58,599 --> 00:40:02,680
experiments or our business here so

993
00:40:01,039 --> 00:40:04,159
we're starting we worked with a I worked

994
00:40:02,679 --> 00:40:07,519
with this

995
00:40:04,159 --> 00:40:08,799
uh um operations research team at here

996
00:40:07,519 --> 00:40:10,920
at Cornell to kind of figure out how we

997
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:13,400
could work out the logistics and

998
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:15,119
hopefully keep keep working that out um

999
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:18,318
I'm working on a system Dynamic model to

1000
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:21,760
show in principle how the positive

1001
00:40:18,318 --> 00:40:25,199
feedback loops of getting more people to

1002
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:28,480
to to to pay for the sanitation service

1003
00:40:25,199 --> 00:40:30,519
because the cost is lower if if he is

1004
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:32,480
taking the job of surfacing the toilets

1005
00:40:30,519 --> 00:40:33,800
off the back of fresh life and making

1006
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:35,519
fertilizer and then you get a positive

1007
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:38,480
feedback loop as we put

1008
00:40:35,519 --> 00:40:40,838
more nutrients into the corn fields get

1009
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:45,280
more corn out get more maze out pize

1010
00:40:40,838 --> 00:40:49,039
more get more yield Etc um photo credit

1011
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:50,480
David work in progress um I rarely do

1012
00:40:49,039 --> 00:40:52,239
anything but I'm making the darn models

1013
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:54,240
I want to credit but thank you David for

1014
00:40:52,239 --> 00:40:55,719
um so anyway so there's a lot of

1015
00:40:54,239 --> 00:40:58,118
challenges I mentioned of which

1016
00:40:55,719 --> 00:41:02,199
sociocultural are obviously leeding

1017
00:40:58,119 --> 00:41:04,000
lights there um so just to say that um

1018
00:41:02,199 --> 00:41:07,399
how do we how do we change how we think

1019
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:09,760
and feel about our excreta um this is a

1020
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:11,720
tiny slice of the porta potties if

1021
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:13,480
you've ever been to Slope Day you know

1022
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:15,358
porta potties as far as the eye can see

1023
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:16,838
I should make a video of how many I mean

1024
00:41:15,358 --> 00:41:20,400
you can even have cuter porta potties in

1025
00:41:16,838 --> 00:41:22,358
that for heaven sake so we you know so I

1026
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:24,838
really we really want us like do some

1027
00:41:22,358 --> 00:41:27,318
you know go big to collect our PE here

1028
00:41:24,838 --> 00:41:28,679
we did a little collection effort and at

1029
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:30,800
forch Fest one time these two young

1030
00:41:28,679 --> 00:41:32,399
women are the only people who took the

1031
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:34,000
time to look at my technical information

1032
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:35,720
around the subject they turned out to be

1033
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:39,039
Cornell engineers and they got us into

1034
00:41:35,719 --> 00:41:42,480
the um Cornell Chronicle for their plant

1035
00:41:39,039 --> 00:41:45,159
Parenthood app um I'm super obsessed

1036
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:47,800
with potties yeah Yan probably Gonna

1037
00:41:45,159 --> 00:41:49,159
Roll his shut off about the potty but

1038
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:51,680
you know how to make the potty

1039
00:41:49,159 --> 00:41:53,440
experience more fun and beautiful and

1040
00:41:51,679 --> 00:41:55,598
and uh you know save the world while

1041
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:57,039
you're peeing uh so we got a couple of

1042
00:41:55,599 --> 00:41:58,760
collection points here Cornell Public

1043
00:41:57,039 --> 00:42:01,719
Health student is helping helped us make

1044
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:02,960
some nice propaganda about that um so

1045
00:42:01,719 --> 00:42:05,000
you know just collecting once a week off

1046
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:08,960
a couple spots please contribute to

1047
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:11,159
plant science and Emerson um she also

1048
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:14,199
made some more outward leaning sort of

1049
00:42:11,159 --> 00:42:15,838
gardener oriented propaganda here um not

1050
00:42:14,199 --> 00:42:17,318
sure we've had any impact the soil

1051
00:42:15,838 --> 00:42:19,440
Factory is sort of all about this sort

1052
00:42:17,318 --> 00:42:22,558
of subject and johannas put on this

1053
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:25,000
Workshop where we made all these cute um

1054
00:42:22,559 --> 00:42:27,880
kidney books and art products around

1055
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:29,679
circular B neutrient economy

1056
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:32,480
um sorry to keep giving you credit you H

1057
00:42:29,679 --> 00:42:34,558
but really making this East African

1058
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:36,639
circular B nutrient economy Network

1059
00:42:34,559 --> 00:42:38,519
happen so it's got a biochar an excr

1060
00:42:36,639 --> 00:42:40,159
component this is the carbon Trader

1061
00:42:38,519 --> 00:42:42,400
showing us how it's done with this

1062
00:42:40,159 --> 00:42:43,838
ridiculous but very enlightening skit

1063
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:48,880
that they put on that's the Cornell

1064
00:42:43,838 --> 00:42:50,480
delegation David and others um the rich

1065
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:52,800
Earth Institute gets credit I think for

1066
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:56,000
for bringing a Global Network together

1067
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:57,720
we just had that 10th Annual sum Summit

1068
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,760
Christina was there in person

1069
00:42:57,719 --> 00:43:03,078
many of us there were were there

1070
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:05,160
virtually um but they're really making a

1071
00:43:03,079 --> 00:43:08,359
very Dynamic many-dimensional

1072
00:43:05,159 --> 00:43:10,440
Community come to life there so so

1073
00:43:08,358 --> 00:43:12,239
what's it really going to take to drive

1074
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:14,639
change you know we talked about the

1075
00:43:12,239 --> 00:43:16,159
opportunities local nutrient value nut

1076
00:43:14,639 --> 00:43:19,358
nutrient sovereignty environmental

1077
00:43:16,159 --> 00:43:21,239
health uh you know us in our fabulous

1078
00:43:19,358 --> 00:43:24,558
activities but really maybe it's the

1079
00:43:21,239 --> 00:43:26,239
past crisis where we can't we can't land

1080
00:43:24,559 --> 00:43:27,839
apply our product anymore and there's no

1081
00:43:26,239 --> 00:43:31,399
carbon going back to the

1082
00:43:27,838 --> 00:43:33,239
um to the land um more more than half of

1083
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:35,280
us biosolids are now land applied we now

1084
00:43:33,239 --> 00:43:37,399
recognize the hazards if you bring

1085
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:39,640
nutrient your bodily nutrients pre

1086
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:42,280
contaminated with all sorts of gross

1087
00:43:39,639 --> 00:43:44,960
things including pasas I think if a few

1088
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:47,400
wastewater treatment can't plants get

1089
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:48,358
hurt by these major storm effects you

1090
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:50,720
know people are going to think twice

1091
00:43:48,358 --> 00:43:52,318
about putting in the many billions

1092
00:43:50,719 --> 00:43:55,919
billions of dollars it takes a up one

1093
00:43:52,318 --> 00:43:58,239
plant um sea whether there's a disaster

1094
00:43:55,920 --> 00:44:00,639
or not sea levels and then 10 million

1095
00:43:58,239 --> 00:44:03,118
people are out of service on the US

1096
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:05,279
coasts if the if the water goes up three

1097
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:07,119
feet long before they're washing away

1098
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:08,880
the plants it's going to corrode them

1099
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:12,160
and put them out of business 10 million

1100
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:15,000
people with three three meters a heck of

1101
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:16,480
lot more with with more than that and

1102
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:18,440
then just even maintaining wastewater

1103
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:20,880
treatment plants and running them cost

1104
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:22,280
one to two% of the global energy budget

1105
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:24,519
so but I really think that we've got to

1106
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:26,040
play our role here we've got to show how

1107
00:44:24,519 --> 00:44:28,159
it's

1108
00:44:26,039 --> 00:44:29,679
done Christine and I are teaching in

1109
00:44:28,159 --> 00:44:33,239
class about this but know can we please

1110
00:44:29,679 --> 00:44:35,480
get the N nutrient producers serving the

1111
00:44:33,239 --> 00:44:37,479
nutrient users the farms and whatnot

1112
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:39,760
using you know learning how to use these

1113
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:42,119
different transformation methods you

1114
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:44,839
know using our food waste and excr more

1115
00:44:42,119 --> 00:44:47,800
creatively anyway it's a journey but

1116
00:44:44,838 --> 00:44:49,960
hopefully you know we'll individually

1117
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:52,599
transition through this disgust to to

1118
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:54,838
Comedy to embrace collectively from the

1119
00:44:52,599 --> 00:44:56,440
sort of dealing with nutrients as a

1120
00:44:54,838 --> 00:44:57,599
problem to dealing with them as a bloody

1121
00:44:56,440 --> 00:44:59,559
resource

1122
00:44:57,599 --> 00:45:02,559
and and seeing that as part of a wider

1123
00:44:59,559 --> 00:45:05,559
transition to a circular

1124
00:45:02,559 --> 00:45:05,559
eony

1125
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:11,240
you yeah I'm sorry I didn't like longer

1126
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:16,280
but well really excited about the ideas

1127
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:18,280
you presented really interesting um I

1128
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:20,240
know you said you didn't want to focus

1129
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:22,640
too much on the issue of pharmaceuticals

1130
00:45:20,239 --> 00:45:24,318
and the urine but I I do have a concern

1131
00:45:22,639 --> 00:45:26,279
about particularly hormones and birth

1132
00:45:24,318 --> 00:45:27,599
control hormones that I know come out in

1133
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:29,480
urine and are very prevalent

1134
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:32,000
particularly you know places like the

1135
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:35,358
United States um and I'm wondering if

1136
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:38,079
you envision some kind of regulatory you

1137
00:45:35,358 --> 00:45:40,400
know testing either for plants or for

1138
00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:41,599
urine going onto plants you know how how

1139
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:44,519
would we make sure that we're not

1140
00:45:41,599 --> 00:45:46,318
getting into another loop of you know

1141
00:45:44,519 --> 00:45:49,719
contaminant spreading like happened with

1142
00:45:46,318 --> 00:45:52,159
biosolids or sludge well the hormones

1143
00:45:49,719 --> 00:45:53,639
are are are such a identifiable in

1144
00:45:52,159 --> 00:45:55,639
particular question I think we you just

1145
00:45:53,639 --> 00:45:57,400
ask and answer that question yeah the

1146
00:45:55,639 --> 00:45:59,279
problem I have is that there's so many

1147
00:45:57,400 --> 00:46:00,880
Pharmaceuticals out there that if you

1148
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:03,319
take it as a class it's much more

1149
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:05,519
difficult to answer but you can assay

1150
00:46:03,318 --> 00:46:06,759
for hormones probably with a simply Lia

1151
00:46:05,519 --> 00:46:08,119
or something I mean you can ask that

1152
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:10,280
question so I

1153
00:46:08,119 --> 00:46:11,838
haven't but I think it's very

1154
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:13,240
practicable to ask that question does it

1155
00:46:11,838 --> 00:46:15,199
get into the food or not into what

1156
00:46:13,239 --> 00:46:17,439
extent um it seems like there' have to

1157
00:46:15,199 --> 00:46:19,719
be some regular testing not just a

1158
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:21,720
one-time thing you know if it's a

1159
00:46:19,719 --> 00:46:24,078
regular application that we're using as

1160
00:46:21,719 --> 00:46:26,399
a food system supplement how would we

1161
00:46:24,079 --> 00:46:29,800
how would we I think you can ask as a as

1162
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:32,240
a science question to what extent do

1163
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:35,000
Pharmaceuticals come through the soil

1164
00:46:32,239 --> 00:46:36,000
plant food access I think that's

1165
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,838
something you could ask and then you

1166
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,639
don't have to test every food item you

1167
00:46:37,838 --> 00:46:41,279
know it does or does not come through if

1168
00:46:39,639 --> 00:46:44,118
it does come through then we have to

1169
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:47,800
pull the nitrogen out the phosphorus out

1170
00:46:44,119 --> 00:46:49,240
without the whole GES right so and

1171
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:50,960
that's very doable that's what we're you

1172
00:46:49,239 --> 00:46:53,358
know Johan that's I'm giving yanas that

1173
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:55,318
angle I mean I work on that too but but

1174
00:46:53,358 --> 00:46:58,078
um but in principle I'm sort of a dump

1175
00:46:55,318 --> 00:46:59,519
it on person um but I but I take your

1176
00:46:58,079 --> 00:47:01,800
point that if you've got a specific

1177
00:46:59,519 --> 00:47:03,239
hypothesis you can test it then you can

1178
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:04,880
know it's not going to suddenly start

1179
00:47:03,239 --> 00:47:06,799
accumulating in plants when it doesn't

1180
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:09,318
accumulate PL right so so I do think

1181
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:14,079
that if you have a particular system and

1182
00:47:09,318 --> 00:47:15,920
a particular um hypothesis or particular

1183
00:47:14,079 --> 00:47:17,280
question then we should definitely add

1184
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:18,920
and it's probably actually known and I

1185
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:20,599
just don't haveen to have it on thank

1186
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:23,400
you so much thank

1187
00:47:20,599 --> 00:47:26,000
you it strikes me there must be a lot of

1188
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:28,639
research on this in China uh when I go

1189
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:31,039
to uh villes in China and I visit

1190
00:47:28,639 --> 00:47:32,558
friends houses it's the recyclable

1191
00:47:31,039 --> 00:47:34,599
toilet and you know that's been going

1192
00:47:32,559 --> 00:47:37,599
for a long long time and my point is

1193
00:47:34,599 --> 00:47:39,318
they must have done also research on

1194
00:47:37,599 --> 00:47:41,318
these things that are now coming into

1195
00:47:39,318 --> 00:47:43,400
the stream so I'm just absolutely I mean

1196
00:47:41,318 --> 00:47:45,358
they get credit for like the time of

1197
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:47,440
Memorial category for sure they're sort

1198
00:47:45,358 --> 00:47:49,880
of the you know have have done have kept

1199
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:51,920
their food system going for all of time

1200
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:53,880
with that very explicitly as an accepted

1201
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:55,159
practice more lately I see it

1202
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:57,318
unfortunately that they're kind of going

1203
00:47:55,159 --> 00:47:59,318
modern and to some extent walking away

1204
00:47:57,318 --> 00:48:01,838
from that but it's still going on in the

1205
00:47:59,318 --> 00:48:04,599
Hinterlands and they are a part of that

1206
00:48:01,838 --> 00:48:05,440
Dynamic e research ecosystem for sure

1207
00:48:04,599 --> 00:48:06,960
you know if you're tracking the

1208
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:09,240
literature you can Bank on them being

1209
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:11,639
really doing a lot of cool stuff a lot

1210
00:48:09,239 --> 00:48:14,279
of it's frankly you know over my

1211
00:48:11,639 --> 00:48:16,039
head but I mean but but credit to them

1212
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:17,680
for going into it and yeah I had

1213
00:48:16,039 --> 00:48:19,599
actually hoped to go to to China last

1214
00:48:17,679 --> 00:48:22,919
year to sort of do a circular economy

1215
00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:25,000
tour partly to be like trying to Lobby

1216
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:27,639
to not have them walk away from their

1217
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:29,920
historical ownership of it topic but

1218
00:48:27,639 --> 00:48:31,440
take credit and pride in that maybe and

1219
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:34,000
and recognize the fact that they in fact

1220
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:36,159
are on the Innovations FR here for

1221
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:39,559
it questions

1222
00:48:36,159 --> 00:48:39,558
forca give her one

1223
00:48:41,159 --> 00:48:46,679
more this has been a production of

1224
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:49,680
Cornell University on the web at

1225
00:48:46,679 --> 00:48:49,679
