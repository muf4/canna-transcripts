1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:04,480
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:11,120
University well thank you so much for

3
00:00:09,119 --> 00:00:14,599
coming out and it's really a pleasure to

4
00:00:11,119 --> 00:00:16,160
be back here at Cornell and um I'm

5
00:00:14,599 --> 00:00:19,839
presenting on a topic that's really

6
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:22,518
special to me so um I'll start off with

7
00:00:19,839 --> 00:00:26,920
um just an introduction to

8
00:00:22,518 --> 00:00:28,678
um why um why this topic is important um

9
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:31,960
and and then some of the research that I

10
00:00:28,678 --> 00:00:33,640
did for my thesis and then Don will give

11
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:36,399
you an overview of what's Happening Here

12
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:40,840
at Cornell um with an exciting new

13
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:44,320
initiative um for me uh the topic of how

14
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:45,879
nature affects well-being um started

15
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,878
more in the Arts than it did in the

16
00:00:45,878 --> 00:00:50,839
Sciences I I studied art history for a

17
00:00:48,878 --> 00:00:54,119
while and um I've always loved this

18
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:56,640
painting by Van go and he wrote in a

19
00:00:54,119 --> 00:00:59,558
letter to his brother how much looking

20
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:02,719
at nature um was a comfort to him and

21
00:00:59,558 --> 00:01:06,399
his fin years when he was confined to an

22
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:09,159
asylum um he um continued to paint and

23
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:12,159
it was really uh the connection to for

24
00:01:09,159 --> 00:01:15,439
his sanity um but what what he was

25
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:17,320
painting was nature and this beautiful

26
00:01:15,438 --> 00:01:19,279
picture came out in one of the last

27
00:01:17,319 --> 00:01:23,039
years of his

28
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:24,879
life uh also literature um i' the The

29
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:28,000
Secret Garden was one of my favorite

30
00:01:24,879 --> 00:01:31,839
books and I really delved into it um a

31
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,959
few years ago and uh again the theme of

32
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:38,200
how working in a garden restores uh

33
00:01:34,959 --> 00:01:40,959
well-being is is very powerful in that

34
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:44,320
story and then of course Cornell this is

35
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:46,559
a picture of the 80 White House Gardens

36
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:49,078
um and that among all the other Gardens

37
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:51,200
and Cornell plantations um there's just

38
00:01:49,078 --> 00:01:52,478
so much Beauty on this campus and not

39
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,960
only as a grad student but as an

40
00:01:52,478 --> 00:01:58,560
undergrad I found so much Solace finding

41
00:01:54,959 --> 00:02:00,599
these places and little places to uh

42
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:04,240
hide away and get away from

43
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:04,239
the pressures of academic

44
00:02:04,599 --> 00:02:12,280
life okay so there's really three um

45
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:15,199
core issues at the heart of my research

46
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:18,280
um first the statistics for mental

47
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:23,039
health among College age students are

48
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:28,080
very shocking um there are 57% who feel

49
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:31,039
overwhelming anxiety um and also

50
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:33,200
35% um who have felt so depressed that

51
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:38,400
it was difficult to function I found

52
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:41,280
that statistic very very troubling um so

53
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:43,039
some of these numbers are really high

54
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:46,680
and

55
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:50,199
um here are some numbers for what causes

56
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:53,400
the most stress academics being the top

57
00:02:50,199 --> 00:02:56,719
um but a whole bunch of other issues as

58
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:58,280
well but um it's definitely a problem

59
00:02:56,719 --> 00:03:01,560
among

60
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:03,318
students so one in three really has

61
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:05,000
faces of some kind of mental health

62
00:03:03,318 --> 00:03:07,518
issue in addition to all the

63
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,959
overwhelming stress uh of being a

64
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:14,319
student so that is another number that

65
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:14,319
is really amazing to

66
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:20,480
me the other issue uh for me was uh

67
00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:22,959
Public Gardens at colleges and

68
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:25,280
universities there are a specific kind

69
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:28,719
of public garden they work with the

70
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:31,759
university by having a mission that

71
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:33,280
coincides with that the university and

72
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:35,679
they are often fighting for their

73
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:40,239
existence um trying to show that they're

74
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:44,519
relevant um to the university and often

75
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:48,920
that leads to some issues um there was

76
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:52,480
an article that it was discussed that um

77
00:03:48,919 --> 00:03:54,598
why should these resources be going to

78
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:56,919
this organization within the university

79
00:03:54,598 --> 00:04:01,518
that maybe is not always clearly

80
00:03:56,919 --> 00:04:04,639
academic um so the issue of

81
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:06,200
relevance uh is a key um part of the

82
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:09,679
equation

83
00:04:06,199 --> 00:04:12,479
uh and then finally the literature on

84
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:14,920
these subjects there's certainly a broad

85
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:17,839
amount of literature on nature and

86
00:04:14,919 --> 00:04:20,478
well-being and and also within each of

87
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:22,959
the areas of health and with mental

88
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:26,560
health and and colleges and universities

89
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:29,038
but where they intersect um it's not uh

90
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,639
as much and it's certainly not as much

91
00:04:29,038 --> 00:04:34,399
when you get into to the study of public

92
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:36,000
gardens particularly um there are many

93
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:37,758
of these Gardens at colleges and

94
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,199
universities and yet they're not really

95
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:44,720
being thought of in terms of how are

96
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:47,199
they helping students um beyond the

97
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:49,840
academic part of their

98
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:53,038
lives um so I'm just arguing the public

99
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:56,519
gardens are um they very well could hold

100
00:04:53,038 --> 00:05:00,918
the keys to a Rejuvenation of student

101
00:04:56,519 --> 00:05:04,000
well-being on on these campuses

102
00:05:00,918 --> 00:05:07,799
and what I wanted to try to answer was

103
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,439
um whether psychological well-being um

104
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:11,960
whether it's a priority at college and

105
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:15,519
university Gardens and whether they can

106
00:05:11,959 --> 00:05:20,478
do a better job at appropriating that

107
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:22,758
role so before I um get into the the

108
00:05:20,478 --> 00:05:25,918
more the research part of I had to

109
00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:28,439
really dig into literature and um I just

110
00:05:25,918 --> 00:05:30,519
want to give an overview of the way I

111
00:05:28,439 --> 00:05:32,120
thought of this was um

112
00:05:30,519 --> 00:05:35,240
kind of going from a broad amount of

113
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:37,680
literature down to a point um starting

114
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:40,840
off with the the breadth of literature

115
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:43,720
on nature and well-being but then going

116
00:05:40,839 --> 00:05:48,599
down and getting closer to the college

117
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:51,199
and university experience um so just so

118
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:53,639
oops okay so these are some of the key

119
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:58,520
thinkers that I wanted to introduce to

120
00:05:53,639 --> 00:06:03,319
um ol who wrote an essay on um the power

121
00:05:58,519 --> 00:06:08,359
of a view um through Hospital Windows

122
00:06:03,319 --> 00:06:12,639
um that patients actually had um a very

123
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:14,479
uh a better chance of recovery and a

124
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:17,840
reaction to pain

125
00:06:14,478 --> 00:06:21,079
medications and um also fewer negative

126
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:23,119
comments from from nurses uh for when

127
00:06:21,079 --> 00:06:25,359
they actually had a view of nature as

128
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:28,840
opposed to a brick

129
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:30,280
wall another um set of authors the

130
00:06:28,839 --> 00:06:33,198
Kaplin

131
00:06:30,279 --> 00:06:36,000
uh wrote about particularly this concept

132
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:40,080
of restorative environments and it's

133
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:43,038
based on this notion that there is

134
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:46,000
attention um D directed attention which

135
00:06:43,038 --> 00:06:50,478
is a voluntary type of attention and it

136
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:54,279
requires effort and when that becomes

137
00:06:50,478 --> 00:06:55,878
fatigued uh that is the the the core of

138
00:06:54,279 --> 00:06:59,038
the problem is directed attention

139
00:06:55,879 --> 00:07:01,240
fatigue and environments natural

140
00:06:59,038 --> 00:07:05,038
environments particularly have been

141
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:07,280
known to soothe this actually restore um

142
00:07:05,038 --> 00:07:10,399
directed attention fatigue uh for

143
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:12,918
different reasons um but particularly

144
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:16,598
because often they create a feeling of

145
00:07:12,918 --> 00:07:19,598
being away um setting being set apart

146
00:07:16,598 --> 00:07:23,800
they have a feeling of of an extent um

147
00:07:19,598 --> 00:07:26,719
of space uh they create Fascination and

148
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:30,918
all these features contribute to an

149
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,919
environment being restorative

150
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:37,360
and our these authors actually right

151
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:41,240
here at Cornell um did a really neat

152
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:44,158
essay about school children and how

153
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:45,960
access to Nature uh really worked as a

154
00:07:44,158 --> 00:07:49,199
buffer for

155
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:52,680
stress so they their concept of nearby

156
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:55,840
nature um the value of having it close

157
00:07:52,680 --> 00:08:00,319
by um it was a function of how well

158
00:07:55,839 --> 00:08:02,878
these students responded and how they um

159
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:06,199
it reduced their amount of

160
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:10,120
stress um Richard Lou uh his classic

161
00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:13,319
concept of nature deficit disorder um

162
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:15,840
kind of close to um attention deficit

163
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:18,759
disorder or other mental disorders but

164
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:21,638
he puts this in the mix and says that

165
00:08:18,759 --> 00:08:25,720
there is a lack of uh interaction with

166
00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:30,000
nature among children and he recommends

167
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:32,719
vitamin n for vitamin nature

168
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:37,000
and then the question of the dose of

169
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:39,479
nature how much is enough um there was a

170
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:43,278
study that was done that said that even

171
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:46,278
a minimal amount of um of exposure to

172
00:08:43,278 --> 00:08:49,278
Nature and and activity in nature just

173
00:08:46,278 --> 00:08:51,080
five minutes was considered the most

174
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:54,639
effective of any of the other amounts

175
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:57,440
that were experimented with so uh a

176
00:08:54,639 --> 00:08:59,958
small amount of time also low intensity

177
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:01,800
was found to be in effective

178
00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:05,039
and um also the difference in

179
00:09:01,799 --> 00:09:06,559
environments um between urban and more

180
00:09:05,039 --> 00:09:08,639
natural it didn't seem to make a

181
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:11,119
difference they were all helpful as long

182
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:13,958
as they had some kind of green

183
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:15,799
element okay so now going just from that

184
00:09:13,958 --> 00:09:19,078
broad amount of literature that's those

185
00:09:15,799 --> 00:09:22,838
are just samples um with mental health

186
00:09:19,078 --> 00:09:24,599
literature uh common themes are that

187
00:09:22,839 --> 00:09:26,640
disorders appear in the first three

188
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:29,480
decades of life and because these are

189
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:31,360
the ages that our college students this

190
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:34,079
is there's a high percentage on these

191
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:36,839
campuses of of students who suffer with

192
00:09:34,078 --> 00:09:38,679
these illnesses um and then other

193
00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:41,959
there's so many other factors that

194
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:44,919
affect mental well-being as well and all

195
00:09:41,958 --> 00:09:45,958
of them are are certainly represented on

196
00:09:44,919 --> 00:09:49,278
diverse

197
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:51,639
campuses um the one that I found

198
00:09:49,278 --> 00:09:53,399
interesting was the issue of help

199
00:09:51,639 --> 00:09:56,838
seeking

200
00:09:53,399 --> 00:10:00,039
is it's something that students are

201
00:09:56,839 --> 00:10:03,640
notorious for not reaching out for help

202
00:10:00,039 --> 00:10:06,838
um and often treatment is delayed

203
00:10:03,639 --> 00:10:09,838
because of that and so it's a challenge

204
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:11,880
that needs to be

205
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:14,959
considered

206
00:10:11,879 --> 00:10:17,240
um in looking for a way into how I was

207
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:19,479
going to approach Public Gardens with

208
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:21,639
this topic I I looked for other studies

209
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:24,079
that were done on campuses and there

210
00:10:21,639 --> 00:10:26,559
were a few um University of

211
00:10:24,078 --> 00:10:29,679
Massachusetts ammer um they they tried a

212
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:33,399
Horticultural therapy intervention um

213
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:37,399
students went in uh and interacted with

214
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:40,799
plants they um did different techniques

215
00:10:37,399 --> 00:10:43,839
with a Horticultural therapist and then

216
00:10:40,799 --> 00:10:46,799
took a survey and found that there are

217
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:49,000
some glitches in the study but um

218
00:10:46,799 --> 00:10:52,120
predominantly it was showing how stress

219
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:55,879
was significantly relieved by this

220
00:10:52,120 --> 00:11:00,440
experience um at this University in Hong

221
00:10:55,879 --> 00:11:02,278
Kong uh views of green spaces and also

222
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:05,600
just the use patterns of different green

223
00:11:02,278 --> 00:11:09,799
spaces were analyzed and recommendations

224
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:13,680
were made um based on those results and

225
00:11:09,799 --> 00:11:15,639
this university in England also um was

226
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:18,120
interesting because it it looked at

227
00:11:15,639 --> 00:11:21,480
different spaces on campus and found

228
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:25,200
that certain spaces closer to buildings

229
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:28,039
uh usually more formal uh environments

230
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:31,920
were really much more preferred than

231
00:11:28,039 --> 00:11:33,559
than further away uh sometimes more wild

232
00:11:31,919 --> 00:11:36,958
or natural

233
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:38,638
environments um and also that as th

234
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:43,359
though many students knew about these

235
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:47,360
spaces only about 50% really used

236
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:51,959
them and then getting into Gardens as a

237
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:53,399
sort of a subset of nature um why what

238
00:11:51,958 --> 00:11:56,359
what is special about the garden

239
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:59,480
particularly and often um Gardens are

240
00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:02,079
described as a series of of rooms and

241
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:06,079
there's a feeling of of Escape or

242
00:12:02,078 --> 00:12:08,838
getting away that they promote

243
00:12:06,078 --> 00:12:11,359
um there was an article done in for the

244
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:14,320
public garden magazine that talked about

245
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:16,159
how Gardens are this Refuge from our

246
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:19,920
difficult time that we live in with so

247
00:12:16,159 --> 00:12:24,198
much information and um technology and

248
00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:27,078
and access to problems worldwide and

249
00:12:24,198 --> 00:12:33,120
that the garden is a safe

250
00:12:27,078 --> 00:12:35,359
place and this was um after 911 um this

251
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:38,039
uh statement was made saying that at the

252
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:40,240
Brooklyn botanic garden there um had

253
00:12:38,039 --> 00:12:43,360
never been such a overflow of people who

254
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:46,879
just needed that Garden right after that

255
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:49,639
devastating day um

256
00:12:46,879 --> 00:12:53,360
so how they open their doors to people

257
00:12:49,639 --> 00:12:56,919
and and people really needed that

258
00:12:53,360 --> 00:13:00,639
space and then in discussing Gardens

259
00:12:56,919 --> 00:13:05,198
there's also a some literature about why

260
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:07,639
we prefer Gardens um and for some it's

261
00:13:05,198 --> 00:13:11,439
goes back to an evolutionary perspective

262
00:13:07,639 --> 00:13:13,759
of that we were designed to our program

263
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:16,720
to really want to be in an environment

264
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:21,278
that feels safe usually an open one with

265
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:24,680
trees um and it it takes away from the

266
00:13:21,278 --> 00:13:28,439
from the stress of that fighter flight

267
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:31,519
response um the other view is especially

268
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:34,639
over most of History was just the

269
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:36,919
creation view um of the story the

270
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:39,480
history of the Garden of Eden and just

271
00:13:36,919 --> 00:13:42,879
that we were made for Gardens um we were

272
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:44,360
made to be gardeners and a man named

273
00:13:42,879 --> 00:13:46,639
Benjamin Rush who was one of our

274
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:50,560
founding fathers and a physician and

275
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:52,519
psych early psychiatrist he wrote about

276
00:13:50,559 --> 00:13:55,559
gardening as an effective means for

277
00:13:52,519 --> 00:13:59,120
treating mentally ill in his day and

278
00:13:55,559 --> 00:14:04,159
Horticultural therapy actually owes um

279
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:06,839
owes its creation to to Benjamin

280
00:14:04,159 --> 00:14:10,519
rash um university

281
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:12,519
Gardens have a history of their own um

282
00:14:10,519 --> 00:14:15,240
they really developed in about the 13th

283
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:19,720
century in England um Oxford and

284
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:23,159
Cambridge were the result of monasteries

285
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:25,720
and uh that dissolved and they had

286
00:14:23,159 --> 00:14:29,559
cloistered Gardens these uh spaces that

287
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:33,160
were very private and um meant to be uh

288
00:14:29,559 --> 00:14:36,399
places of healing and Escape for people

289
00:14:33,159 --> 00:14:40,439
and these became places of institutions

290
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:43,440
of learning and then later on um in

291
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:44,639
Europe and especially Italy um in the

292
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:47,360
16th

293
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:50,560
century Gardens at universities started

294
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:54,000
to become more incorporated into the

295
00:14:50,559 --> 00:14:56,518
intellectual um life of the University

296
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:59,679
they became great collections and they

297
00:14:56,519 --> 00:15:03,480
were studied for their plants for their

298
00:14:59,679 --> 00:15:07,198
qualities and so the concept of the

299
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:09,159
garden as a living classroom um really

300
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:12,240
started to develop and I think is what

301
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:15,519
is predominant today and this is our

302
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:17,039
lovely Cornell plantations and just had

303
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:19,360
to get that in

304
00:15:17,039 --> 00:15:22,799
there

305
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:26,720
um my study had two parts I did a series

306
00:15:22,799 --> 00:15:29,559
of interviews with nine Public Gardens

307
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:32,120
at colleges and universities and I

308
00:15:29,559 --> 00:15:35,000
wanted to ask a variety of

309
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:39,198
questions um these are the institutions

310
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:42,919
so Arnold at Harvard um Smith college uh

311
00:15:39,198 --> 00:15:47,039
Cornell of course Garvin is a beautiful

312
00:15:42,919 --> 00:15:49,838
garden that's 175 miles apart from its

313
00:15:47,039 --> 00:15:53,318
campus in Arkansas and just gave another

314
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:55,519
an interesting um insight into its

315
00:15:53,318 --> 00:15:59,479
challenges that it has in reaching

316
00:15:55,519 --> 00:16:02,399
students um Ralston in North Carolina

317
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:04,399
Mai at University of Michigan Morris

318
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:07,000
arum University of Pennsylvania Scott

319
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:08,720
arum at swore and UC

320
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,679
Davis

321
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:13,920
um it was a broad different kinds of

322
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:15,039
gardens uh so it gave me a lot of

323
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:19,120
different

324
00:16:15,039 --> 00:16:21,679
perspectives um key to what I was

325
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:24,799
looking for uh from these Gardens was

326
00:16:21,679 --> 00:16:28,719
the mission that um not only the mission

327
00:16:24,799 --> 00:16:32,399
of the garden but of the university and

328
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:37,360
how how they c um complimented each

329
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:40,839
other um so this quotation is one that

330
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:43,839
is often that was posed to Public

331
00:16:40,839 --> 00:16:46,920
Gardens as saying to stay relevant be

332
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:49,040
sure that your mission is in the vein of

333
00:16:46,919 --> 00:16:53,240
the mission of your overarching

334
00:16:49,039 --> 00:16:55,399
organization the the university

335
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:58,000
um and then this was

336
00:16:55,399 --> 00:17:00,919
another uh thought that came out of

337
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:06,599
these interviews was the concern about

338
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:10,480
being not academic enough um some one at

339
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:13,879
least one Garden uh voiced this concern

340
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:15,959
uh that it wasn't it was afraid of not

341
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:18,360
of embracing other types of initiatives

342
00:17:15,959 --> 00:17:20,120
because it might not appear academic

343
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:23,879
enough um that it was just seen as a

344
00:17:20,119 --> 00:17:27,119
beautiful place um which is an

345
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:31,000
interesting uh way of looking at it that

346
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:33,319
it's somehow bad but um so this is

347
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,880
something I wanted to think about more

348
00:17:33,319 --> 00:17:38,519
uh throughout the process um my

349
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:41,440
questions were very basic questions

350
00:17:38,519 --> 00:17:44,879
about just access to the garden and how

351
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:47,720
they Market themselves but also more

352
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:51,080
questions related to well-being um how

353
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:53,240
it's stated in mission statements uh

354
00:17:51,079 --> 00:17:56,439
what types of spaces they

355
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:58,679
offer um if they have any involvement

356
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:59,960
with Health Services those types of

357
00:17:58,679 --> 00:18:04,720
question

358
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:06,880
questions and so a a large area of what

359
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:09,798
I was looking at were statements of

360
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:11,760
mission and vision and I just put up

361
00:18:09,798 --> 00:18:14,558
Cornell for instance just a couple

362
00:18:11,759 --> 00:18:17,919
Snippets that show how they're very much

363
00:18:14,558 --> 00:18:20,519
related um Cornell with enhancing lives

364
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:22,600
and livelihoods of students and Cornell

365
00:18:20,519 --> 00:18:25,480
Cornell plantations with enhancing

366
00:18:22,599 --> 00:18:29,119
collections for the enrichment of

367
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:31,759
students so there's definitely a um an

368
00:18:29,119 --> 00:18:34,279
interplay and I looked at the text of

369
00:18:31,759 --> 00:18:37,640
these statements for all these these

370
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:40,319
Gardens and their their universities and

371
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:43,880
looked for how they might um introduce

372
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:47,678
the topic of well-being or uh reaching

373
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:49,919
students um my observations from the

374
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:52,880
from the um mission statements part of

375
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:54,840
the research was few had really direct

376
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:57,640
references but there were a couple uh

377
00:18:54,839 --> 00:19:00,079
that actually talked about how Gardens

378
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:03,799
are how Gardens and how the university

379
00:19:00,079 --> 00:19:06,359
is reaching out to benefit student lives

380
00:19:03,798 --> 00:19:09,079
um and particularly actually making

381
00:19:06,359 --> 00:19:14,079
reference to well-being um but those

382
00:19:09,079 --> 00:19:15,599
were few uh otherwise there was I I

383
00:19:14,079 --> 00:19:17,798
believe there was more of a perception

384
00:19:15,599 --> 00:19:21,519
that they were helping helping students

385
00:19:17,798 --> 00:19:26,879
in this way but not so much actually

386
00:19:21,519 --> 00:19:29,038
making this an an explicit uh Mission um

387
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:30,960
I I identifi different types of of

388
00:19:29,038 --> 00:19:36,558
references that were indirect things

389
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:39,000
that referenced um sustainability or um

390
00:19:36,558 --> 00:19:41,359
other aspects that gestured towards

391
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:46,079
well-being and there were many of these

392
00:19:41,359 --> 00:19:49,599
um and I I saw them as opportunities for

393
00:19:46,079 --> 00:19:52,879
um the garden to embrace as ways of

394
00:19:49,599 --> 00:19:54,599
getting into the topic of well-being and

395
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:57,120
um promoting

396
00:19:54,599 --> 00:20:00,119
well-being

397
00:19:57,119 --> 00:20:03,038
um when I looked at uh when I asked the

398
00:20:00,119 --> 00:20:06,678
gardens for um spaces that they

399
00:20:03,038 --> 00:20:08,798
considered restorative and that promoted

400
00:20:06,679 --> 00:20:11,440
this feeling of getting away that was

401
00:20:08,798 --> 00:20:15,519
that I found in the literature um

402
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:18,960
usually um highly designed areas were

403
00:20:15,519 --> 00:20:23,319
mentioned um natural areas

404
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:25,558
too um a couple times uh Asian theme

405
00:20:23,319 --> 00:20:27,000
Gardens were referenced as being

406
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:29,558
considered

407
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:33,079
restorative um and sometimes those that

408
00:20:29,558 --> 00:20:35,639
were at a distance from the campus or

409
00:20:33,079 --> 00:20:39,279
that contained a structure within it

410
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:40,840
were referenced as being considered

411
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:43,639
restorative

412
00:20:40,839 --> 00:20:45,359
um so there's these are some images from

413
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:48,759
some of these Gardens including

414
00:20:45,359 --> 00:20:51,639
plantations but also um spaces that have

415
00:20:48,759 --> 00:20:54,119
been considered by the the people that I

416
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:56,440
spoke with as being

417
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:59,279
restorative um in terms of

418
00:20:56,440 --> 00:21:02,279
programming uh five of the Guard

419
00:20:59,279 --> 00:21:05,960
had programs that were about addressing

420
00:21:02,279 --> 00:21:08,359
well-being um often or most all of them

421
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:13,480
were an exercise program or more of

422
00:21:08,359 --> 00:21:16,199
physical health um two of those Gardens

423
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:19,640
had programs specifically for student

424
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:23,840
well-being um and plantations being one

425
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:26,080
of them and so I think there's

426
00:21:23,839 --> 00:21:28,839
definitely something going on just

427
00:21:26,079 --> 00:21:32,038
hasn't actually filtered down to student

428
00:21:28,839 --> 00:21:35,038
students specifically yet um but there

429
00:21:32,038 --> 00:21:37,000
are some developments that are happening

430
00:21:35,038 --> 00:21:40,278
um The Escape program at Morris

431
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:43,599
Arboretum is is an exciting one to watch

432
00:21:40,278 --> 00:21:46,558
um they have the issue of being about 10

433
00:21:43,599 --> 00:21:49,759
miles away from downtown Philadelphia

434
00:21:46,558 --> 00:21:53,960
the campus so enticing students to get

435
00:21:49,759 --> 00:21:58,558
away and to get away from the the busy

436
00:21:53,960 --> 00:22:02,159
downtown um environment um the mor are

437
00:21:58,558 --> 00:22:04,440
Freedom has really um taken advantage of

438
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:06,960
different types of media to Market to

439
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:08,840
students um that this notion through the

440
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:11,960
notion of escape and it's been very

441
00:22:08,839 --> 00:22:16,439
successful and offering um

442
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:19,640
transportation particularly um but this

443
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:22,720
has been a successful U example of

444
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:25,360
trying to get students out in

445
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:29,319
nature and then with working together

446
00:22:25,359 --> 00:22:32,119
with Health Services only a few are have

447
00:22:29,319 --> 00:22:35,720
had active conversations um again

448
00:22:32,119 --> 00:22:37,959
plantations is in there and two two of

449
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:40,400
these Gardens are have had that

450
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:42,360
relationship started as a result of

451
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:44,480
student suicides that was just an

452
00:22:42,359 --> 00:22:47,839
interesting one to keep aware of that

453
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:50,839
often these calamities actually promote

454
00:22:47,839 --> 00:22:52,399
these conversations and would it be the

455
00:22:50,839 --> 00:22:55,119
other way around that would that would

456
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:57,278
be really wonderful um that they would

457
00:22:55,119 --> 00:23:00,439
be approached before these types of

458
00:22:57,278 --> 00:23:00,440
events happen

459
00:23:00,759 --> 00:23:06,158
um I wanted to get a more a narrower

460
00:23:04,359 --> 00:23:10,319
picture besides what was happening in

461
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:13,360
public gardens in across the board so I

462
00:23:10,319 --> 00:23:15,240
had a ready sample here at Cornell and I

463
00:23:13,359 --> 00:23:16,639
wanted to just get some student

464
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:18,679
perspectives as opposed to

465
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:22,799
administrators of public ardens is what

466
00:23:18,679 --> 00:23:26,000
I was speaking with um so I I did a few

467
00:23:22,798 --> 00:23:29,200
surveys of of a variety of students I

468
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:31,880
wanted to compare um two types of

469
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:35,159
students uh ones that are focused more

470
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:37,159
on nature such as in horiculture and

471
00:23:35,159 --> 00:23:39,559
then students who are notoriously not

472
00:23:37,159 --> 00:23:43,080
focused on nature um engineering

473
00:23:39,558 --> 00:23:44,879
students and um who actually have a

474
00:23:43,079 --> 00:23:47,918
reputation at Cornell as being the most

475
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:52,640
stressed of all students um but I don't

476
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:54,320
know if that's true um so my survey um

477
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,919
was just a simple paper survey with

478
00:23:54,319 --> 00:23:59,038
asking a variety of questions about

479
00:23:55,919 --> 00:24:01,400
their level of stress uh for for one

480
00:23:59,038 --> 00:24:03,640
thing and what was interesting was the

481
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:05,919
Horticulture students and

482
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:09,759
Engineers although I had about some

483
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:13,720
different numbers of how many students I

484
00:24:09,759 --> 00:24:19,119
interviewed the same percentages um had

485
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:21,839
a high level of um of frequent stress so

486
00:24:19,119 --> 00:24:24,319
it was basically proportional on the

487
00:24:21,839 --> 00:24:27,079
kinds of stress that they were reporting

488
00:24:24,319 --> 00:24:32,038
um so most of them had several times a

489
00:24:27,079 --> 00:24:34,839
week uh and then another large chunk was

490
00:24:32,038 --> 00:24:37,759
those who said all the time and taken

491
00:24:34,839 --> 00:24:42,359
together those are about

492
00:24:37,759 --> 00:24:45,919
74% and it was equal to the

493
00:24:42,359 --> 00:24:49,639
engineers as well so it that was

494
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:51,799
interesting um for me to find and also I

495
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:55,399
asked about coping

496
00:24:51,798 --> 00:24:58,798
strategies um eating more um sleeping

497
00:24:55,398 --> 00:25:01,239
more as far as activities evolving

498
00:24:58,798 --> 00:25:04,879
nature going outside spending time in

499
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:06,440
nature um these activities tended to be

500
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:09,278
more

501
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:14,080
um more likely done by horiculture

502
00:25:09,278 --> 00:25:16,240
students as opposed to the engineers um

503
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:18,199
I don't know why horiculture students

504
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:21,120
were two times more likely to consume or

505
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:24,558
drink drugs and that's a little

506
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:26,479
troubling but um but it was also

507
00:25:24,558 --> 00:25:30,038
interesting that they were more likely

508
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:35,880
to spend time in nature

509
00:25:30,038 --> 00:25:38,079
um the I the notion of um whether nature

510
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:39,440
prescriptions I I asked students whether

511
00:25:38,079 --> 00:25:41,759
they would they thought nature

512
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:44,679
prescriptions such as being prescribed

513
00:25:41,759 --> 00:25:48,079
to take a walk in nature um whether that

514
00:25:44,679 --> 00:25:52,519
would be an effective treatment um for

515
00:25:48,079 --> 00:25:55,639
stress and for other illnesses um and

516
00:25:52,519 --> 00:25:59,558
those who said that it would be very

517
00:25:55,640 --> 00:26:02,000
effective um tended to rate

518
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:04,960
the the benefits of Nature and to

519
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:08,079
well-being and also the the value that

520
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:11,759
they placed on on green things on campus

521
00:26:08,079 --> 00:26:13,119
they rated those areas the highest um

522
00:26:11,759 --> 00:26:15,558
those who

523
00:26:13,119 --> 00:26:18,839
rated uh the connection between nature

524
00:26:15,558 --> 00:26:22,398
and well-being lower and also who valued

525
00:26:18,839 --> 00:26:24,639
nature less actually did did not like

526
00:26:22,398 --> 00:26:29,359
the idea of nature prescriptions as much

527
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:31,520
so there was a connection there um

528
00:26:29,359 --> 00:26:35,519
I asked about what prevents you from

529
00:26:31,519 --> 00:26:38,679
spending more time outside um Engineers

530
00:26:35,519 --> 00:26:41,879
were more likely in certain areas not to

531
00:26:38,679 --> 00:26:44,559
know where places were um it wasn't what

532
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:47,360
their friends were doing and just a

533
00:26:44,558 --> 00:26:47,359
preference for being

534
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:56,480
indoors and then what I wanted to get

535
00:26:51,599 --> 00:26:59,439
across here was that those who been who

536
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:03,038
reported that nature was was beneficial

537
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:06,080
to well-being and that campus green was

538
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:08,759
important to them um who WR when they WR

539
00:27:06,079 --> 00:27:10,599
it the highest um they also that

540
00:27:08,759 --> 00:27:12,960
coincided with the number of times that

541
00:27:10,599 --> 00:27:16,959
they visit visited a public garden or

542
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:19,880
Cornell plantations in this case um the

543
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:23,360
ones who voted who go to plantations

544
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:28,200
every day they also valued nature the

545
00:27:23,359 --> 00:27:31,959
most um and then the ones who never or

546
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:33,319
only once once a year would go into any

547
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:37,200
of the areas of

548
00:27:33,319 --> 00:27:41,798
plantations uh they rated the value of

549
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:45,960
nature to well-being very low or um also

550
00:27:41,798 --> 00:27:49,480
the value of of green and plants um was

551
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:52,319
rated lower the fewer times that they uh

552
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:52,319
would spend at

553
00:27:52,919 --> 00:27:58,278
plantations um I wanted to find out what

554
00:27:55,839 --> 00:27:59,918
might entice students to come to plant

555
00:27:58,278 --> 00:28:03,640
ations more

556
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:08,038
and top being more um transportation

557
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:12,159
being offered events and activities uh

558
00:28:08,038 --> 00:28:15,158
Wi-Fi um some were just you just can't

559
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:15,159
get to them so

560
00:28:15,839 --> 00:28:21,240
they're and I at the end I just had

561
00:28:19,558 --> 00:28:24,759
recommendations

562
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:27,399
um one being that

563
00:28:24,759 --> 00:28:29,079
identifying making a case for well-being

564
00:28:27,398 --> 00:28:32,000
and often getting it down and writing is

565
00:28:29,079 --> 00:28:34,558
very helpful um having it in a mission

566
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,278
and and if it's not try to see if you

567
00:28:34,558 --> 00:28:39,678
can get it in there because it it's

568
00:28:36,278 --> 00:28:43,679
something everybody can work from

569
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:48,519
um trying to make a link between

570
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:52,440
academic performance and well-being um

571
00:28:48,519 --> 00:28:56,240
might help this cause be uh promoted

572
00:28:52,440 --> 00:29:00,200
more um because there is that concern of

573
00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:03,440
being uh relevant and and often for

574
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:06,919
universities it's the academic

575
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:08,919
achievement is is the top so um showing

576
00:29:06,919 --> 00:29:12,080
the the connection between how

577
00:29:08,919 --> 00:29:14,960
well-being um often and how nature

578
00:29:12,079 --> 00:29:17,480
experiences can really boost your

579
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:20,558
concentration and your ability to

580
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:23,919
perform um that might be a way for

581
00:29:20,558 --> 00:29:26,519
Gardens to say um look at us and this is

582
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:29,480
an important thing we can do for the

583
00:29:26,519 --> 00:29:32,319
organization for the University

584
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:35,278
um not only just being a garden but

585
00:29:32,319 --> 00:29:38,119
coming at it with others such as health

586
00:29:35,278 --> 00:29:40,278
services um Don will be telling you

587
00:29:38,119 --> 00:29:43,479
about an initiative here at Cornell that

588
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:45,480
is doing this very thing um looking at

589
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:47,399
the Garden and seeing what types of

590
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:49,360
spaces it has that could be considered

591
00:29:47,398 --> 00:29:51,798
restorative and really marketing those

592
00:29:49,359 --> 00:29:55,000
to students

593
00:29:51,798 --> 00:29:59,278
um getting ideas from other Gardens like

594
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:02,839
the Escape program at Morris or um just

595
00:29:59,278 --> 00:30:04,880
taking a step um there's a Grassroots

596
00:30:02,839 --> 00:30:08,158
organization called active Minds that

597
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:10,960
was started at upen um in the wake of a

598
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:15,240
student suicide and uh this group has

599
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:17,519
just grown and they do uh awareness

600
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:19,480
events at universities and it would be

601
00:30:17,519 --> 00:30:22,038
interesting to have maybe host one of

602
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:24,519
those events at a public garden and get

603
00:30:22,038 --> 00:30:26,640
involved in um that

604
00:30:24,519 --> 00:30:31,558
conversation and just staying

605
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:35,960
open-minded um as just as a way

606
00:30:31,558 --> 00:30:39,319
of being a living classroom but also um

607
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:42,278
promoting other other issues and student

608
00:30:39,319 --> 00:30:46,439
well-being is a pretty important one

609
00:30:42,278 --> 00:30:49,159
so um I'm gonna hand this over to Don

610
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:52,360
who will talk about nature

611
00:30:49,159 --> 00:30:55,240
RX thank you Erica and I'm really

612
00:30:52,359 --> 00:30:58,519
pleased to have this opportunity to talk

613
00:30:55,240 --> 00:31:01,399
about an initiative with which we've

614
00:30:58,519 --> 00:31:04,839
been involved for a couple of years now

615
00:31:01,398 --> 00:31:07,119
in fact it was a meeting of the land

616
00:31:04,839 --> 00:31:10,480
subcommittee of the president's

617
00:31:07,119 --> 00:31:13,199
sustainable campus committee where

618
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:15,798
Maryann krne a professor in natural

619
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:18,960
resources David cutter the university

620
00:31:15,798 --> 00:31:22,240
landscape architect and I got together

621
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:25,399
on the side and we were collectively

622
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:28,319
boning the fact that there were so few

623
00:31:25,398 --> 00:31:32,638
efforts on campus to really really

624
00:31:28,319 --> 00:31:35,200
encourage students to spend time

625
00:31:32,638 --> 00:31:39,240
outdoors and one of us and actually I'm

626
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:44,679
not even sure at this point who it

627
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:47,798
was um had heard about an effort that a

628
00:31:44,679 --> 00:31:52,399
group of progressive physicians in the

629
00:31:47,798 --> 00:31:54,879
Washington DC area had started in

630
00:31:52,398 --> 00:31:58,439
conjunction with the National Park

631
00:31:54,880 --> 00:32:01,880
Service and that partnership led to

632
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:06,880
something called nature prescriptions in

633
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:10,200
which these Physicians were for patients

634
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:14,559
who were suffering from anxiety or

635
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:17,480
extreme stress or obesity related issues

636
00:32:14,558 --> 00:32:21,480
they were actually writing prescriptions

637
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:25,038
for those individuals to spend time out

638
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:27,960
in the local national parks the

639
00:32:25,038 --> 00:32:31,480
contribution by the park service was to

640
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:34,919
develop very detailed descriptions of

641
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:38,440
each of their Holdings in the greater DC

642
00:32:34,919 --> 00:32:41,559
area what types of natural features were

643
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:44,880
present um how difficult the paths were

644
00:32:41,558 --> 00:32:47,319
to walk on how you can access them by

645
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:50,440
car or public

646
00:32:47,319 --> 00:32:55,398
transportation and this seemed to us

647
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:58,880
like a great model for transferring to

648
00:32:55,398 --> 00:33:02,879
Cornell so it was at that that point

649
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:07,600
that we started to organize a group of

650
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:10,720
Faculty staff clinicians from ganette

651
00:33:07,599 --> 00:33:15,240
and graduate and undergraduate students

652
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:18,000
under the theme of nature RX at Cornell

653
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:21,440
and as you can see our very simple goal

654
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:24,638
is to reduce stress and thereby increase

655
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:28,720
physical and mental health in students

656
00:33:24,638 --> 00:33:31,479
through their engagement with nature and

657
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:34,319
hopefully through that engagement to

658
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:38,360
cultivate in students an increased

659
00:33:34,319 --> 00:33:41,319
depreciation for nature so in the two

660
00:33:38,359 --> 00:33:44,918
intervening years since we first created

661
00:33:41,319 --> 00:33:47,398
this group uh we have achieved a number

662
00:33:44,919 --> 00:33:49,840
of goals we've done a lot of research

663
00:33:47,398 --> 00:33:54,158
we've discovered that there's a national

664
00:33:49,839 --> 00:33:59,558
group that calls itself nature RX Tera

665
00:33:54,159 --> 00:34:02,880
mat and um if you Google RX you will see

666
00:33:59,558 --> 00:34:05,599
that they have very very funny videos

667
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:08,159
that are intended for a youth audience

668
00:34:05,599 --> 00:34:11,239
when you see something beautiful and all

669
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:14,119
you can think about is Instagram filters

670
00:34:11,239 --> 00:34:17,598
you may need to spend more time out in

671
00:34:14,119 --> 00:34:20,200
nature and um both of the videos that

672
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:23,200
that group has developed thus far are in

673
00:34:20,199 --> 00:34:26,158
that sort of light-hearted vein but with

674
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:29,678
a very serious message that we all need

675
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:34,240
to spend more time at out in

676
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:37,599
nature so we feel that in promoting

677
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:39,559
nature to students we need to focus on

678
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:42,720
some easily

679
00:34:39,559 --> 00:34:45,119
graspable benefits that the time in

680
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:48,759
nature will

681
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:51,159
provide so we are talking about the need

682
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:53,720
to be active are you worried about

683
00:34:51,159 --> 00:34:55,919
sluggishness time Outdoors is one of the

684
00:34:53,719 --> 00:34:58,799
best predictors of being Physically

685
00:34:55,918 --> 00:35:01,519
Active which can help to maintain

686
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:04,560
healthy heart healthy

687
00:35:01,519 --> 00:35:06,320
weight get smarter this is something

688
00:35:04,559 --> 00:35:08,880
that appeals to students are you

689
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:11,640
preparing for an exam time that you

690
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:15,599
spend in nature enhances cognitive

691
00:35:11,639 --> 00:35:18,519
functioning and attention sometimes time

692
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:21,039
out in nature can be better than an hour

693
00:35:18,519 --> 00:35:24,400
of cramming before a

694
00:35:21,039 --> 00:35:27,960
prelim get engaged are you feeling

695
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:31,800
isolated which is as Erica was

696
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:35,280
explaining a very common cause of Stress

697
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:38,320
and Anxiety among students so find a

698
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:41,160
walking running or hiking Club research

699
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:44,320
suggests that nature is a social magnet

700
00:35:41,159 --> 00:35:47,799
that draws people together and fosters

701
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:50,720
social interaction and get well and this

702
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:53,640
really is the essence of what we are

703
00:35:50,719 --> 00:35:56,598
focusing on if you're feeling bad just

704
00:35:53,639 --> 00:35:59,480
take a short daily walk to improve your

705
00:35:56,599 --> 00:36:02,559
feeling of

706
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:07,920
well-being so in what ways are we

707
00:36:02,559 --> 00:36:10,920
carrying out this nature RX approach one

708
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:14,280
that was very interesting and very

709
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:18,960
successful this past fall is that Sonia

710
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:22,920
Skelly led a firste student class called

711
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:26,199
Take It Outside in which each week uh

712
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:28,119
the student enroles were led by a

713
00:36:26,199 --> 00:36:31,279
different Cornell expert

714
00:36:28,119 --> 00:36:35,039
to explore one of Cornell's magnificent

715
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:38,760
natural areas in a different way we've

716
00:36:35,039 --> 00:36:42,679
been working for several months on a CU

717
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:46,119
in nature app and website and very

718
00:36:42,679 --> 00:36:50,159
recently we were really gratified that

719
00:36:46,119 --> 00:36:53,000
the IT team at student services has

720
00:36:50,159 --> 00:36:56,279
taken over the further development of

721
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:59,920
this app and website and we're going to

722
00:36:56,280 --> 00:37:02,040
be very actively and heavily promoting

723
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:04,960
those and I'll talk a bit more about

724
00:37:02,039 --> 00:37:08,358
that in a moment something that we're

725
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:11,760
quite excited about is that in following

726
00:37:08,358 --> 00:37:14,519
up on that Washington DC model the

727
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:17,240
clinicians at Cornell Health what we

728
00:37:14,519 --> 00:37:21,039
have known as ganette in the past are

729
00:37:17,239 --> 00:37:24,279
now actually writing paper prescriptions

730
00:37:21,039 --> 00:37:26,920
that they hand out to students that say

731
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:28,839
nature is beneficial to you we want you

732
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:32,079
to go out in nature and then they can

733
00:37:28,838 --> 00:37:36,239
check boxes once a week twice a week

734
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:40,318
four times a week and um the clinicians

735
00:37:36,239 --> 00:37:43,479
at ganette are very interested in

736
00:37:40,318 --> 00:37:46,239
conducting a study of those students who

737
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:50,159
have received these prescriptions to see

738
00:37:46,239 --> 00:37:53,078
what impact it has on them over

739
00:37:50,159 --> 00:37:56,239
time we are starting to promote the

740
00:37:53,079 --> 00:37:58,240
benefits of time and nature in the ways

741
00:37:56,239 --> 00:38:02,439
that I was just explaining

742
00:37:58,239 --> 00:38:04,719
through various media um you know I'm an

743
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:07,318
old faculty member so I don't really

744
00:38:04,719 --> 00:38:08,838
know what students follow these days but

745
00:38:07,318 --> 00:38:12,119
we've discovered there's something

746
00:38:08,838 --> 00:38:15,639
called slope media which has both a

747
00:38:12,119 --> 00:38:18,880
paper publication and an online

748
00:38:15,639 --> 00:38:21,118
constantly changing website and blog so

749
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:24,079
we have an interview set up later this

750
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:28,240
week with one of the editors at slope

751
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:30,920
media we're also working with members

752
00:38:28,239 --> 00:38:33,159
of the student assembly uh to get an

753
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:37,000
article in the Daily

754
00:38:33,159 --> 00:38:39,559
Sun um one of the undergraduate students

755
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:43,639
that marshia IM shely worked with last

756
00:38:39,559 --> 00:38:47,159
fall did a comprehensive study of every

757
00:38:43,639 --> 00:38:51,078
course offered at Cornell to see which

758
00:38:47,159 --> 00:38:54,598
ones are currently utilizing nature to

759
00:38:51,079 --> 00:38:57,560
enhance their teaching which ones could

760
00:38:54,599 --> 00:39:00,599
benefit from greater use of time

761
00:38:57,559 --> 00:39:01,759
outdoors and which ones are never going

762
00:39:00,599 --> 00:39:06,519
to get

763
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:09,040
outside um we are in early discussions

764
00:39:06,519 --> 00:39:12,400
with faculty in the department of

765
00:39:09,039 --> 00:39:17,039
communications about building a research

766
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:20,039
project around messaging of encouraging

767
00:39:17,039 --> 00:39:22,358
students to spend time Outdoors to see

768
00:39:20,039 --> 00:39:25,920
how different forms of messaging

769
00:39:22,358 --> 00:39:28,838
different messages themselves will have

770
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:31,760
impact and uh we have a meeting this

771
00:39:28,838 --> 00:39:34,159
coming Saturday in which we've invited

772
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:37,560
student representatives from

773
00:39:34,159 --> 00:39:40,759
organizations across campus to come

774
00:39:37,559 --> 00:39:44,759
together and to advise us on how we can

775
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:49,400
make the nature RX efforts more

776
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:53,160
effective more impactful for all of

777
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:57,559
them so one of the earliest things that

778
00:39:53,159 --> 00:39:59,879
or earliest efforts in our nature RX

779
00:39:57,559 --> 00:40:02,440
initiative was the development of a

780
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:05,358
campus map by David cutter our

781
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:09,358
University landscape architect in which

782
00:40:05,358 --> 00:40:14,239
he pointed out some of excuse me some of

783
00:40:09,358 --> 00:40:18,000
the key um natural areas on campus like

784
00:40:14,239 --> 00:40:19,639
BB Lake and both uh cascadilla and Fall

785
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:22,318
Creek

786
00:40:19,639 --> 00:40:26,559
Gorges that was sort of the jumping off

787
00:40:22,318 --> 00:40:29,519
point for us to work with a graduate

788
00:40:26,559 --> 00:40:34,480
student in information Sciences to

789
00:40:29,519 --> 00:40:37,679
develop an app called CU in nature that

790
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:40,880
includes many of the natural areas that

791
00:40:37,679 --> 00:40:44,358
are managed by Cornell plantations as

792
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:47,640
well as natural areas in the center of

793
00:40:44,358 --> 00:40:50,920
Campus like we stinky Glenn uh tiger

794
00:40:47,639 --> 00:40:53,799
Glenn and as of last week the Liberty

795
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:53,800
hiy Bailey

796
00:40:54,480 --> 00:41:01,800
conservatory and here you can see uh a

797
00:40:57,519 --> 00:41:05,440
couple of the pages from that app and

798
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:08,160
this IT specialist from student services

799
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:11,000
who I was mentioning is now working on

800
00:41:08,159 --> 00:41:15,279
the further development of that and a

801
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:18,280
companion website so the idea here is

802
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:21,079
not to have students be studying this

803
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:24,440
app or website on their iPhones while

804
00:41:21,079 --> 00:41:27,359
they're out in nature but rather to have

805
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:30,318
them become familiar with the

806
00:41:27,358 --> 00:41:33,318
spectacular natural sites that exist

807
00:41:30,318 --> 00:41:35,559
here at Cornell and to learn how far it

808
00:41:33,318 --> 00:41:39,519
is from their dorm there's going to be a

809
00:41:35,559 --> 00:41:42,719
new feature on the website in which um a

810
00:41:39,519 --> 00:41:46,440
user can say how far am I from the

811
00:41:42,719 --> 00:41:49,358
closest uh Natural Area right now and it

812
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:52,358
will tell how many minutes the walk is

813
00:41:49,358 --> 00:41:55,199
to that site and how to get

814
00:41:52,358 --> 00:41:57,239
there an effort we were involved with

815
00:41:55,199 --> 00:42:00,118
this past November with president

816
00:41:57,239 --> 00:42:04,598
president Beth Garrett who is in our

817
00:42:00,119 --> 00:42:08,440
thoughts was also called Take It Outside

818
00:42:04,599 --> 00:42:12,559
and it was a walk around BB Lake and to

819
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:15,358
the plantation's um Winter Garden for

820
00:42:12,559 --> 00:42:18,358
students and members of both the Cornell

821
00:42:15,358 --> 00:42:22,000
and local community and through nature

822
00:42:18,358 --> 00:42:26,119
RX we anticipate running more and more

823
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:29,480
events like this simple events to just

824
00:42:26,119 --> 00:42:32,160
get people at out in nature and to find

825
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:35,400
how close and how attractive and how

826
00:42:32,159 --> 00:42:35,399
enjoyable it

827
00:42:35,639 --> 00:42:42,799
is and this is a shot from the Take It

828
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:45,759
Outside class um that Sonia Skelly ran

829
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:48,039
this past fall here is another shot and

830
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:50,520
one of the things about getting out in

831
00:42:48,039 --> 00:42:54,519
nature is that you need to do it in all

832
00:42:50,519 --> 00:42:56,519
types of weather um and as you can see

833
00:42:54,519 --> 00:43:01,039
the students were going down the gorge

834
00:42:56,519 --> 00:43:03,800
with Sarah fiello and were uh mostly uh

835
00:43:01,039 --> 00:43:07,480
prepared for that in terms of their

836
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:13,039
clothing so what I'd like to say in

837
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:16,559
wrapping this up is that we have

838
00:43:13,039 --> 00:43:20,480
simultaneously both a very very highly

839
00:43:16,559 --> 00:43:24,119
stressed and anxious student body and

840
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:28,199
the statistics that Erica was sharing

841
00:43:24,119 --> 00:43:31,358
earlier bear those out um um the

842
00:43:28,199 --> 00:43:33,799
counselors from the Caps program at

843
00:43:31,358 --> 00:43:36,480
Cornell Health um counseling and

844
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:40,640
Psychological Services indicate that

845
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:43,760
between 18 and 20% of all undergraduates

846
00:43:40,639 --> 00:43:47,159
seek their support each year that's an

847
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:50,680
enormous number so at the same time we

848
00:43:47,159 --> 00:43:53,199
have this very stressed student body we

849
00:43:50,679 --> 00:43:56,440
also have one of the most beautiful

850
00:43:53,199 --> 00:43:58,639
campuses in the world I mean look at

851
00:43:56,440 --> 00:44:02,000
this that that's right next to the

852
00:43:58,639 --> 00:44:06,239
engineering quad so we feel that we have

853
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:09,838
this incredible opportunity to use the

854
00:44:06,239 --> 00:44:13,639
natural beauty of our campus of Cornell

855
00:44:09,838 --> 00:44:17,719
plantations to entice students outside

856
00:44:13,639 --> 00:44:21,239
and to contribute to their overall

857
00:44:17,719 --> 00:44:21,239
well-being so thank

858
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:32,519
you any questions for Erica or myself I

859
00:44:29,358 --> 00:44:36,078
this kind of a weird question um so if

860
00:44:32,519 --> 00:44:39,039
the the uh the stress is created under a

861
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:41,480
natural environment would pursuing

862
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:44,239
nature still be a way to release her

863
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:46,400
stress like for example this may might

864
00:44:44,239 --> 00:44:48,159
not be unfamiliar to horiculture student

865
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:50,480
because sometimes we work in the in the

866
00:44:48,159 --> 00:44:52,960
field or collecting s hole in the forest

867
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:56,039
for a very long that creates the

868
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:59,318
[Music]

869
00:44:56,039 --> 00:45:01,079
stress you want to handle that one I

870
00:44:59,318 --> 00:45:05,119
never expected that question I think

871
00:45:01,079 --> 00:45:09,280
it's a great question and I think that

872
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:13,000
time in nature can um have certain

873
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:16,000
stresses associated with it one as you

874
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:18,719
point out is if you're there really

875
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:22,880
doing work in order to get that work

876
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:26,558
completed can be stressful um another is

877
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:29,039
that if you're not certain of the route

878
00:45:26,559 --> 00:45:32,440
that you're following it's easy to

879
00:45:29,039 --> 00:45:36,159
become stressed about finding your way

880
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:40,519
back to the starting point um and I

881
00:45:36,159 --> 00:45:44,838
recall that when I was in Costa Rica

882
00:45:40,519 --> 00:45:49,838
several years ago there was a program to

883
00:45:44,838 --> 00:45:52,358
get um kids from within San Jose the

884
00:45:49,838 --> 00:45:56,279
capital city who had spent no time in

885
00:45:52,358 --> 00:45:58,960
nature to just step into woods and that

886
00:45:56,280 --> 00:46:02,359
in itself was very stressful for them

887
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:05,400
because it was such an unfamiliar

888
00:46:02,358 --> 00:46:07,880
environment so just becoming familiar

889
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:10,480
and comfortable with nature is often the

890
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:12,200
first step I think it's a matter of

891
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:16,159
mindfulness of what you're choosing to

892
00:46:12,199 --> 00:46:21,318
focus on or moving your your attention

893
00:46:16,159 --> 00:46:24,960
off of the research onto the less uh

894
00:46:21,318 --> 00:46:27,800
demanding uh environment around you um

895
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:31,480
so it's a it's a choice I guess

896
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:33,240
of um letting yourself get off of one

897
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:36,159
thing the

898
00:46:33,239 --> 00:46:38,479
other taking a five minute break from

899
00:46:36,159 --> 00:46:38,480
data

900
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:46,838
to it seems like I mean like you were

901
00:46:45,358 --> 00:46:48,799
saying it's stressful for people

902
00:46:46,838 --> 00:46:50,480
sometimes who are famili you just step

903
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:53,880
into

904
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:56,960
it with it um I always I've often

905
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:58,559
thought that like incorporating kind of

906
00:46:56,960 --> 00:47:01,199
identification

907
00:46:58,559 --> 00:47:03,720
skills like just go hand in hand because

908
00:47:01,199 --> 00:47:05,399
I always say you walk in any Urban

909
00:47:03,719 --> 00:47:08,000
person or any person who doesn't spend

910
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:09,599
time walk into the kitchen and identify

911
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:12,440
everything in the kitchen and know

912
00:47:09,599 --> 00:47:15,599
something's out of place yet in nature

913
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:18,559
they don't know what's safe what's not

914
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:21,838
safe the environment is safer you know

915
00:47:18,559 --> 00:47:24,160
so like do you think about how maybe

916
00:47:21,838 --> 00:47:25,119
to incorporate or you think that's

917
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:28,440
important

918
00:47:25,119 --> 00:47:30,400
inor I think definitely the case one

919
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:33,039
study was that the natural areas the

920
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:34,880
more wild areas were not approached

921
00:47:33,039 --> 00:47:37,920
because they were afraid of them or just

922
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:39,720
didn't know about them um and I think

923
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:42,280
they were trying to get at the idea of

924
00:47:39,719 --> 00:47:44,719
interpretation is the answer these were

925
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:47,200
actually people took time to describe

926
00:47:44,719 --> 00:47:51,078
these places to

927
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:55,000
um to actually um make them more

928
00:47:51,079 --> 00:47:58,079
familiar um it would be used more and uh

929
00:47:55,000 --> 00:48:00,039
also in the survey that students were

930
00:47:58,079 --> 00:48:03,800
many raised that concern that they

931
00:48:00,039 --> 00:48:05,400
wouldn't be safe um or they had many

932
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:07,800
different types of concern that's when

933
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:11,318
come outside so I think taking that time

934
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:13,640
to to speak to the students and and

935
00:48:11,318 --> 00:48:15,599
interpret what these places are and what

936
00:48:13,639 --> 00:48:17,358
they're going to find there and also

937
00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:19,800
teaching them about nature learning

938
00:48:17,358 --> 00:48:21,400
about what plants are the more you more

939
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:24,000
you know the more you see the more you

940
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:28,039
enjoy

941
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:29,400
so yes yeah so um it from your survey

942
00:48:28,039 --> 00:48:32,719
data it seemed like there was a pretty

943
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:36,039
strong correlation between uh time spent

944
00:48:32,719 --> 00:48:38,279
out the words and appreciation of nature

945
00:48:36,039 --> 00:48:40,199
is that causational is it a chick of the

946
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:42,000
neck thing like do you love nature

947
00:48:40,199 --> 00:48:44,399
because you spend time Outdoors or the

948
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:46,079
other way around or do they both kind of

949
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:47,920
feed back into each other that's a

950
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:50,559
really good question I I to think about

951
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:54,280
that a lot um I I think what I was

952
00:48:50,559 --> 00:48:55,480
trying to at least argue was that um the

953
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:58,760
more

954
00:48:55,480 --> 00:49:00,920
of if if a love of nature can be

955
00:48:58,760 --> 00:49:05,000
established then there'll be a greater

956
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:07,200
use of it um and so as far as which

957
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:09,838
causes which I don't know sometimes for

958
00:49:07,199 --> 00:49:12,480
some it might be greater knowledge and

959
00:49:09,838 --> 00:49:15,039
hence be more familiar with something um

960
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:18,519
creates that that love and enjoyment of

961
00:49:15,039 --> 00:49:21,599
nature um for others it might be that

962
00:49:18,519 --> 00:49:25,880
love draws them to to want to learn more

963
00:49:21,599 --> 00:49:27,359
about it um so I think it is a give and

964
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:29,599
take and I I don't don't know the answer

965
00:49:27,358 --> 00:49:33,119
to that

966
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:36,119
question yes yes Geneva any

967
00:49:33,119 --> 00:49:36,119
questions

968
00:49:36,559 --> 00:49:42,440
Al no question from okay thanks take one

969
00:49:40,318 --> 00:49:46,079
more yeah we'll take one more question

970
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:47,280
Phil um Erica do do you think that

971
00:49:46,079 --> 00:49:49,440
getting getting back to the question

972
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:51,000
that being out in in a Wilder area might

973
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:52,960
be stressful do you think that that

974
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:56,960
could be an example of how important it

975
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:58,760
is having smaller uh more control old

976
00:49:56,960 --> 00:50:00,240
Gardens on a campus could be truly

977
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:02,680
beneficial a small garden where you're

978
00:50:00,239 --> 00:50:03,679
not going to get lost a small garden

979
00:50:02,679 --> 00:50:07,399
that is

980
00:50:03,679 --> 00:50:09,440
obviously manmade construction close to

981
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:11,119
your building but still would have the

982
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:14,519
benefit of being around trees being

983
00:50:11,119 --> 00:50:16,838
around pants for this 5 P absolutely and

984
00:50:14,519 --> 00:50:19,318
I think there really isn't at least some

985
00:50:16,838 --> 00:50:22,000
of the data was trying to show that it

986
00:50:19,318 --> 00:50:24,719
didn't matter if it was Urban nature or

987
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:27,159
more rural nature just any amount of

988
00:50:24,719 --> 00:50:28,959
green really was beneficial so

989
00:50:27,159 --> 00:50:30,960
taking it in more bite-sized pieces

990
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:34,358
definitely places right around building

991
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:36,599
seem to be very popular and so easy to

992
00:50:34,358 --> 00:50:40,480
get to that um I think the ease of

993
00:50:36,599 --> 00:50:43,119
access is a huge Factor so

994
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:45,400
um yeah definitely there's a value to

995
00:50:43,119 --> 00:50:48,640
these smaller spaces and hopefully

996
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:50,798
campuses can maybe U keep cultivating

997
00:50:48,639 --> 00:50:54,099
them and

998
00:50:50,798 --> 00:50:58,599
yeah thank you America
