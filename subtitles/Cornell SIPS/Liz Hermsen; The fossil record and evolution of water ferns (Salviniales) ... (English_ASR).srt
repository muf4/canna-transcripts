1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:04,759
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:06,759 --> 00:00:11,679
University uh so my talk today is on the

3
00:00:09,359 --> 00:00:13,879
fossil record and evolution of water

4
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:15,638
Ferns and I'm going to be talking about

5
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:17,359
work that I've done on Patagonian

6
00:00:15,638 --> 00:00:21,439
fossils and North American fossils

7
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:23,840
you'll see some European fossils um so

8
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:26,679
all parts of the world just a little bit

9
00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:28,800
about myself first um so there are a lot

10
00:00:26,678 --> 00:00:31,640
of Institutions and people who have made

11
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:34,120
this work possible collectors fossil

12
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:35,920
collections uh Jennifer spiko who some

13
00:00:34,119 --> 00:00:37,439
of you might know has has been working

14
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:39,760
in Alejandra lab and has helped with

15
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:41,679
some of the Imaging but I especially

16
00:00:39,759 --> 00:00:43,359
want to highlight my collaborators on

17
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:46,399
the projects I'll be showing today so

18
00:00:43,359 --> 00:00:48,840
these are my co-authors um Dr alahan

19
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:51,039
Alejandra Gandolfo of course has been my

20
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:53,960
longtime collab collaborator and I was a

21
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:58,160
postto in her lab years ago uh from

22
00:00:53,960 --> 00:01:00,558
Argentina Ruben coo Mari zamala and also

23
00:00:58,159 --> 00:01:02,959
fundo de Benedetti had been working on

24
00:01:00,558 --> 00:01:05,319
these projects and then Nathan Jud who

25
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:07,640
was also a former postto in Alejandra's

26
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:10,798
lab and uh is now a professor I believe

27
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:14,519
at William juwel College in Missouri um

28
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:16,960
was also a co-author on one of these

29
00:01:14,519 --> 00:01:18,759
studies all right so a little bit about

30
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:20,798
where I'm coming from and what I'm doing

31
00:01:18,759 --> 00:01:23,159
at Cornell uh I work at the

32
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:25,400
paleontological research institution

33
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:27,320
which is located across the lake it runs

34
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:30,280
the Museum of the earth and the kuga

35
00:01:27,319 --> 00:01:32,519
Nature Center a lot of my job is is

36
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:36,118
involved in Outreach and I also do

37
00:01:32,519 --> 00:01:38,640
research so in terms of research and let

38
00:01:36,118 --> 00:01:40,959
me ah I do have a laser pointer uh I've

39
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:43,840
been working on the gray fossil site

40
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:46,959
from Tennessee this fossil site is about

41
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:49,280
4.5 to 4.9 million years old if you were

42
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:51,239
here a few years ago I gave a talk on

43
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:54,159
that fossil site which is H fruit and

44
00:01:51,239 --> 00:01:56,158
Seed Flora I also do a lot of Outreach

45
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:57,880
projects especially on the web I've been

46
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:00,640
involved in digital Encyclopedia of

47
00:01:57,879 --> 00:02:02,199
ancient life writing about embryo ites

48
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,519
uh putting together the regional Guides

49
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:06,879
of earth science in here on Earth and

50
00:02:04,519 --> 00:02:10,159
also working on a website on grasses for

51
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:13,280
the evolution part of uh Earth at

52
00:02:10,159 --> 00:02:16,280
home so here at Cornell I've primarily

53
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:17,919
been working on Patagonian paleo Flores

54
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:20,318
like I said I was a postto in

55
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:22,759
Alejandra's lab a number of years ago

56
00:02:20,318 --> 00:02:25,119
and that's where I got my start on this

57
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:27,959
project I've done fieldwork in Patagonia

58
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:30,080
a number of times uh this photo and this

59
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:31,560
photo is from our recent trip which is

60
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:35,200
in was in

61
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:37,239
December um I've also uh worked on a

62
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:39,759
number of studies on these floras

63
00:02:37,239 --> 00:02:42,599
primarily Laguna Delo which is eosine

64
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:44,598
and some Cretaceous material uh recently

65
00:02:42,598 --> 00:02:46,959
I worked on this paper that Teddy Mattel

66
00:02:44,598 --> 00:02:48,799
was also on he was an undergrad in

67
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:50,640
Alejandra's lab and he's now at the

68
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:53,800
University of Michigan and we're

69
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:55,598
continuing to work on a report on uh

70
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:57,400
fossil plants from the national parks

71
00:02:55,598 --> 00:02:59,799
that's sponsored by the paleontological

72
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:02,920
society and right now with her I'm

73
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:06,760
working on this on name Dixon so uh

74
00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:06,759
fossils from the Cretaceous of

75
00:03:08,919 --> 00:03:13,359
Argentina and I'm also working with the

76
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,519
Cornell University py Botanical

77
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:18,519
collections so one goal for this

78
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:20,920
collection is to try to enhance its

79
00:03:18,519 --> 00:03:23,560
curation uh the collection is right now

80
00:03:20,919 --> 00:03:26,399
held in Emerson Hall uh there are a lot

81
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:29,199
of fossil cabinets and drawers so we

82
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:32,560
want to get this unpacked and organized

83
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:32,560
and get cabinets for the

84
00:03:33,318 --> 00:03:38,079
collection so before I begin uh talking

85
00:03:36,158 --> 00:03:39,759
about the fossils I think a lot of

86
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,719
people here probably are not

87
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:45,039
paleontologists and don't deal with the

88
00:03:41,719 --> 00:03:47,120
geological time scale a lot so uh I'll

89
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:49,239
be talking about a lot of geological

90
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:53,280
time periods the geological time scale

91
00:03:49,239 --> 00:03:56,200
is a relative time scale the furoic is

92
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:58,479
uh the Eon in which most of the fossil

93
00:03:56,199 --> 00:04:01,119
record occurs so most of the complex

94
00:03:58,479 --> 00:04:03,158
macro fossils we think of I'll be

95
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:06,039
talking today primarily about fossils

96
00:04:03,158 --> 00:04:08,519
from the Mesozoic and cenozoic eras so

97
00:04:06,039 --> 00:04:11,239
they're younger than 252 million years

98
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:13,959
old uh the Mesozoic Era is the time of

99
00:04:11,239 --> 00:04:16,399
the dinosaurs it ends at 66 million

100
00:04:13,959 --> 00:04:18,199
years ago with an asteroid impact that

101
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:20,399
killed the dinosaurs so this is known as

102
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:22,919
the end Cretaceous Extinction the

103
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:25,439
Cretaceous paleogene boundary or in

104
00:04:22,918 --> 00:04:27,719
older literature the Cretaceous terer

105
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:30,079
boundary and then after that we have the

106
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:32,840
cazic so this is when we have the of

107
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:35,279
mammals um also the Flora starts to look

108
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:38,319
a lot more modern so I will also show

109
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:40,079
some fossils from the cazic era as well

110
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:42,279
uh if you haven't memorized this whole

111
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:45,120
time scale I've tried to put in a lot of

112
00:04:42,279 --> 00:04:48,079
numerical ages to help everybody uh stay

113
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,079
oriented in

114
00:04:49,319 --> 00:04:55,560
time all right so water ferns what are

115
00:04:52,478 --> 00:04:58,199
they uh modern water ferns or extant

116
00:04:55,560 --> 00:05:00,918
water ferns are in the order Salen ales

117
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:04,400
their Le oriate ferns this is the most

118
00:05:00,918 --> 00:05:06,719
diverse group of living ferns uh they

119
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:08,079
are heterosporous so I'll return to that

120
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,400
in a moment but basically they're

121
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:12,879
producing two different sizes of spores

122
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:15,719
large megaspores smaller

123
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:18,000
microspores uh modern salven Alis are

124
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:20,720
divided into two families one of these

125
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:24,038
is the marcelia this is the water Clover

126
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:27,880
family uh marcelia has three living

127
00:05:24,038 --> 00:05:30,839
Genera pilia ridium and marcelia these

128
00:05:27,879 --> 00:05:33,918
plants have Ryon and rooted in the

129
00:05:30,839 --> 00:05:37,000
soil the other family is

130
00:05:33,918 --> 00:05:40,599
Salinas modern Salinas consists of two

131
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,600
gener of floating aquatic

132
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:46,918
plants so some of the characteristics of

133
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:49,720
these ferns um I've already mentioned

134
00:05:46,918 --> 00:05:52,799
their growth forms in general compared

135
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:55,280
to what we might think of as a typical

136
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:57,600
or stereotypical Fern Leaf they have

137
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:59,679
relatively simplified leaves so if we

138
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:03,680
think of this stereotypical Fern leaf is

139
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:06,160
a large pinely compound leaf um in these

140
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:09,038
groups the leaves can be simple uh they

141
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:11,880
can have two leaflets four leaflets or

142
00:06:09,038 --> 00:06:14,598
in the case of pilia way over here there

143
00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:17,279
are no leaflets and and the leaves just

144
00:06:14,598 --> 00:06:19,839
look like these little stocks the ferns

145
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:22,758
are heterosporous this is unusual most

146
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:25,198
modern ferns are homosporous so in

147
00:06:22,759 --> 00:06:27,639
heterosporous ferns they produce two

148
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:30,280
different types of spores megaspores the

149
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:32,560
mega spores give rise to the mega aites

150
00:06:30,279 --> 00:06:34,318
which produce the eggs the microspores

151
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:37,478
are smaller they give rise to the

152
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:39,520
microphytes which produce the sperm

153
00:06:37,478 --> 00:06:40,560
megaspores are produced in capsules

154
00:06:39,519 --> 00:06:43,038
called

155
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:45,519
megasporangia uh each megasporangium

156
00:06:43,038 --> 00:06:49,478
produces only one megaspore so there's

157
00:06:45,519 --> 00:06:51,799
monom measor in the in these ferns uh

158
00:06:49,478 --> 00:06:53,680
the the micros sprang are the capsules

159
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:56,160
that produce the microspores and each

160
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:58,680
micros sprum produces more than one

161
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:01,599
microspore the sorai or the groups of

162
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:03,519
spanga can be either heteros scate and

163
00:07:01,598 --> 00:07:06,680
marcelia this means they're producing

164
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:09,719
both megaspores and microspores or they

165
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:11,840
can be homos and Sven which means

166
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:14,240
they're only producing megaspores or

167
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:17,359
they're only producing microspores and

168
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,360
this will come up

169
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:23,959
later all right so what can the fossil

170
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,519
record tell us about these ferns what

171
00:07:23,959 --> 00:07:27,758
does it tell us in general and what does

172
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:30,560
it tell us about these ferns

173
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:33,319
specifically the fossil record is

174
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:35,478
physical evidence of past life it

175
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:37,639
actually shows us the physical

176
00:07:35,478 --> 00:07:40,560
structures of ancient plants that are

177
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:42,680
now extinct and this is the only direct

178
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,560
evidence we have for these plants

179
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:46,680
obviously we can make inferences about

180
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:49,879
character Evolution for things like

181
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:52,000
through methods like biogenetic analysis

182
00:07:49,879 --> 00:07:54,199
but the fossil record is kind of a a

183
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,759
reality check on that what was really

184
00:07:54,199 --> 00:07:59,439
going on in the past so the fossil

185
00:07:56,759 --> 00:08:01,680
record of water firms plausibly there

186
00:07:59,439 --> 00:08:04,319
are some older records starts near the

187
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:08,840
Jurassic Cretaceous boundary so this is

188
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:12,560
about 145 million years ago the record

189
00:08:08,839 --> 00:08:17,000
largely consists of spores and there's

190
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:19,158
been especially uh an emphasis on

191
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,560
megaspores the megaspore record in the

192
00:08:19,158 --> 00:08:22,680
Mesozoic it's not only important for

193
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:24,478
understanding the evolution of these

194
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:26,598
ferns some of these things can be

195
00:08:24,478 --> 00:08:28,038
important bio stratag graphically so

196
00:08:26,598 --> 00:08:30,079
when you're looking at the ages of

197
00:08:28,038 --> 00:08:33,120
sediments the environment things like

198
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:34,879
that so what do these fossils tell us

199
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:37,639
they can tell us about characters that

200
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:40,120
are no longer present in the modern

201
00:08:37,639 --> 00:08:41,679
ferns so the ones I have highlighted in

202
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:43,799
yellow are things I'm going to talk

203
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:45,278
about today the ones that aren't are

204
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:47,159
some things that I'm not really going to

205
00:08:45,278 --> 00:08:49,799
talk about they aren't projects that

206
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:52,519
I've worked on um but I have examples of

207
00:08:49,799 --> 00:08:54,599
them over here so one thing the fossil

208
00:08:52,519 --> 00:08:56,759
record can tell us is that some of these

209
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:59,200
plants may have had more complex leaves

210
00:08:56,759 --> 00:09:01,919
in the past so an example of this as

211
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:03,720
hydrop aridium this fossil over here you

212
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:06,159
can see the plant reconstructed here

213
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:09,079
with these more complex leaves uh this

214
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:11,679
is from the lake Cretaceous of

215
00:09:09,078 --> 00:09:13,639
Canada they can also tell us about some

216
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:16,479
structures that are no longer present in

217
00:09:13,639 --> 00:09:20,078
modern Gena so one example of the this

218
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:22,320
is floats on salvinia spor aites also

219
00:09:20,078 --> 00:09:25,958
mini floated aola

220
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:28,800
megaspores uh heter heteros sprit sorai

221
00:09:25,958 --> 00:09:31,359
and svenia so these examples I'll talk

222
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:33,240
about later and that some of these

223
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:36,000
ancient ferns may have produced more

224
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:37,720
than one megaspore per megas sprum so

225
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,240
that's based on a study that de benad

226
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:44,519
denal did in 2020 reinterpreting these

227
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:46,959
spores and Spang of paleo vaza

228
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:49,120
patagonica so you can see this megas

229
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:52,239
sprum here very clearly with two

230
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:54,039
megaspores um in this fossil form and

231
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,799
the plant that produced these spores is

232
00:09:54,039 --> 00:09:58,639
unknown so we don't know what the

233
00:09:55,799 --> 00:10:00,479
sporify looked like uh the fossil record

234
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:02,639
can also tell us about the sequence of

235
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:05,039
evolution of characters and I'll talk

236
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:07,199
about that a little bit when I get into

237
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:07,199
U

238
00:10:09,159 --> 00:10:15,078
marcelia all right so I'm starting with

239
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:17,240
Marcel AC the water Clover family uh as

240
00:10:15,078 --> 00:10:19,719
I mentioned before this this family has

241
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:21,639
three extant Gena one thing that

242
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:24,639
distinguishes the extant Gena is the

243
00:10:21,639 --> 00:10:26,879
leaf type so marcelia has the most

244
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:28,639
complex leaves they have four leaflets

245
00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:31,759
they look like little clovers hence the

246
00:10:28,639 --> 00:10:35,480
name water Clover regium has two

247
00:10:31,759 --> 00:10:37,319
leaflets per leaf and pilia has no

248
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:40,159
leaflets so again they just look like

249
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:42,320
stocks and this is sort of an idealized

250
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:44,838
version of of what one of these plants

251
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:47,278
would look like with a ryome The Roots

252
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:48,920
the leaves and then these little round

253
00:10:47,278 --> 00:10:53,240
structures or bean-like structures are

254
00:10:48,919 --> 00:10:53,240
sporo carbs those are the reproductive

255
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:57,159
structures all right so let's take a

256
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:59,879
look at the sporocarps the sporocarps

257
00:10:57,159 --> 00:11:02,639
and merceli are interest they are

258
00:10:59,879 --> 00:11:06,278
probably some sort of modification of

259
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:10,320
the leaves um you can see in the

260
00:11:06,278 --> 00:11:12,480
center uh sporocarps on a living plant

261
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:14,560
in the upper left and upper right are

262
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:17,360
longitudinal sections a fresh section

263
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:20,319
and a fix section and down here is a

264
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:23,759
detail of the sporocarp wall so each of

265
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:26,800
the sporocarps has multiple Sor the Sor

266
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:30,360
sorai are these oblong areas and within

267
00:11:26,799 --> 00:11:33,639
the sorai are the spria so these Sor are

268
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:36,759
mixed they produce both megaspores and

269
00:11:33,639 --> 00:11:39,879
microspores um the sporocarp walls are

270
00:11:36,759 --> 00:11:41,759
thick and scarified this is a section in

271
00:11:39,879 --> 00:11:43,600
this case the the sclar Ina hasn't

272
00:11:41,759 --> 00:11:46,600
really developed the thick walls so it's

273
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:50,240
not that clear but um there would be

274
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:52,560
multiple layers of of sparids here and

275
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:55,320
then when the sporocarps open they

276
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:57,599
release this gelatinous kind of

277
00:11:55,320 --> 00:12:01,519
structure to which these sorai are

278
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:03,680
attached and the break down and release

279
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:03,679
the

280
00:12:05,679 --> 00:12:11,679
spores one other important thing to note

281
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:14,078
about marcelia is it's not just the

282
00:12:11,679 --> 00:12:16,759
leaves that distinguish the Gena it's

283
00:12:14,078 --> 00:12:19,719
also the spores and with a particular

284
00:12:16,759 --> 00:12:22,319
emphasis here on the megaspores so here

285
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:24,839
are the megaspores of the three Genera

286
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:26,120
uh you'll notice pilia and regium have

287
00:12:24,839 --> 00:12:29,880
these

288
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:33,159
appendages at the tips of the the megas

289
00:12:29,879 --> 00:12:36,399
uh these are called acryi they're LED in

290
00:12:33,159 --> 00:12:39,278
the case of regium they're also sort of

291
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:42,000
Twisted and then in

292
00:12:39,278 --> 00:12:43,720
marcelia the acry has actually been

293
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,839
reduced to just a

294
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:48,800
rim so spores with these acry lelli can

295
00:12:46,839 --> 00:12:50,880
be found in the fossil record in the

296
00:12:48,799 --> 00:12:52,958
modern forms there's also a gelatinous

297
00:12:50,879 --> 00:12:55,439
layer involved in the formation of the

298
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:57,838
Acela and this is all involved in in

299
00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:00,839
fertilization of the mega

300
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:00,839
gapy

301
00:13:03,399 --> 00:13:07,198
so the fossil Spore record is really

302
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:09,639
important in this group these are some

303
00:13:07,198 --> 00:13:12,240
examples of Mesozoic Spore types so

304
00:13:09,639 --> 00:13:14,159
these are extinct Spore types so the

305
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:16,839
Spore record goes back to about the

306
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:20,078
Jurassic Rous boundary that's 145

307
00:13:16,839 --> 00:13:23,040
million years ago uh the mesic megaspore

308
00:13:20,078 --> 00:13:25,078
types are arsoles so this really

309
00:13:23,039 --> 00:13:27,000
spectacular looking Spore is an example

310
00:13:25,078 --> 00:13:29,559
of aroles there are a lot of different

311
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:32,519
species of this the plant that produced

312
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:35,198
these spores is unidentified it has not

313
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:37,519
been found um it's assumed to be related

314
00:13:35,198 --> 00:13:39,479
to Marcil AC because of this really

315
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:42,000
spectacular appendage at the tip which

316
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:44,959
looks sort of like the modern ones the

317
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:48,440
other megaspore type is mosora uh you

318
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:51,078
can see the acry very nicely here uh

319
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:54,040
mosora looks very much like the spores

320
00:13:51,078 --> 00:13:57,638
of mod excuse me of modern

321
00:13:54,039 --> 00:13:59,958
regium uh particularly Moser Lata some

322
00:13:57,639 --> 00:14:02,440
other species of mos have different

323
00:13:59,958 --> 00:14:04,719
ornamentation there are also microspores

324
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:07,440
Kellis varieties down here is one of

325
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:09,160
these which is somewhat regium like uh

326
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:12,240
the other one that's usually associated

327
00:14:09,159 --> 00:14:14,240
with the group is gabos sporus and then

328
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:16,399
at the end of the Mesozoic these foror

329
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:18,639
types are replaced by spores that are

330
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:20,240
placed in the modern Gena so marcilia

331
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:23,799
pilia and

332
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:25,799
regium and in 2013 Collinson at all said

333
00:14:23,799 --> 00:14:27,479
that these meso Spore types probably

334
00:14:25,799 --> 00:14:30,599
really go extinct because there have

335
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:33,759
been some records of the meso spor types

336
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:33,759
continuing into the

337
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:40,160
cazo okay sporophytes are what I'm

338
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:42,639
mostly interested in I work on plant

339
00:14:40,159 --> 00:14:44,879
macrofossils the sporify record of this

340
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:47,278
group goes back again about to the

341
00:14:44,879 --> 00:14:50,039
Jurassic Cretaceous boundary there is an

342
00:14:47,278 --> 00:14:52,360
older record from the Triassic I think

343
00:14:50,039 --> 00:14:55,719
it's pretty dubious so I haven't really

344
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:59,120
included it here uh the record consists

345
00:14:55,720 --> 00:15:01,720
largely of plants so whole plants also

346
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:03,519
leaves and detached leaflets that's

347
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:06,320
mostly what's found in the record there

348
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:08,679
are a few sporocarps and even fewer of

349
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:10,360
these have spores this is an interesting

350
00:15:08,679 --> 00:15:12,758
phenomenon that's been noted by

351
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:14,639
paleobotanist because these These

352
00:15:12,759 --> 00:15:16,600
sporocarps are so resistant why aren't

353
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:19,278
you finding them in the fossil record

354
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:22,040
nobody really knows um there are a lot

355
00:15:19,278 --> 00:15:24,120
of identification problems historically

356
00:15:22,039 --> 00:15:25,719
and continuing to the present day with

357
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:30,600
these ferns a lot of things are

358
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:30,600
misidentified into this family

359
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,839
all right so the first uh projects I'm

360
00:15:34,919 --> 00:15:39,559
going to talk about are the LA Colonia

361
00:15:36,839 --> 00:15:41,040
Marcel AC so la Colonia is one of the

362
00:15:39,559 --> 00:15:43,559
formations that I've been working on

363
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:45,799
with Dr Galo and collaborators in

364
00:15:43,559 --> 00:15:47,719
Argentina um these are three of the

365
00:15:45,799 --> 00:15:49,679
papers two of them are from La Colonia

366
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:52,319
one's about mercel AC if you want to

367
00:15:49,679 --> 00:15:54,198
read more about these projects so I'm

368
00:15:52,318 --> 00:15:56,759
going to give two examples one's a

369
00:15:54,198 --> 00:15:59,679
fossil taxon that's similar to a modern

370
00:15:56,759 --> 00:16:01,720
firm almost IND distinguish

371
00:15:59,679 --> 00:16:04,278
the other one is a fossil taxon with a

372
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:06,079
unique morphology so both of these come

373
00:16:04,278 --> 00:16:08,439
from the law Colonia

374
00:16:06,078 --> 00:16:10,359
formation so a little bit about this

375
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:12,759
formation and the context for these

376
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:14,959
fossils and I should say this map is a

377
00:16:12,759 --> 00:16:17,839
little bit weird uh South America was

378
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:20,000
not tilted on its axis in the Cretaceous

379
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:23,639
so North is kind of somewhere up over

380
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:25,879
here um the important thing though is

381
00:16:23,639 --> 00:16:28,759
the lack Colonia formation occurs down

382
00:16:25,879 --> 00:16:32,159
here in modern chibo Province at this

383
00:16:28,759 --> 00:16:34,519
time it was very near the coast so

384
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:36,719
sediments from this formation some of

385
00:16:34,519 --> 00:16:39,159
them were deposited in Marine settings

386
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:41,560
some were deposited in terrestrial

387
00:16:39,159 --> 00:16:43,639
settings there are a lot of vertebrate

388
00:16:41,559 --> 00:16:46,359
fossils knowing from this formation

389
00:16:43,639 --> 00:16:48,560
probably the most famous is Carnotaurus

390
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:50,480
this this guy up here but there are

391
00:16:48,559 --> 00:16:52,879
Marine vertebrates there are many other

392
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:55,480
things uh and this is just an example of

393
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:59,439
what the formation looks like

394
00:16:55,480 --> 00:17:00,800
today but in the past it looked very

395
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:02,880
different it was a very different

396
00:17:00,799 --> 00:17:05,480
environment so again the left two

397
00:17:02,879 --> 00:17:07,439
pictures show the formation today uh the

398
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:08,599
formation looks like what we might call

399
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:11,160
in the US

400
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:14,678
Badlands there isn't a lot of vegetation

401
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:16,519
it's very dry it's very eroded uh on the

402
00:17:14,679 --> 00:17:18,400
right is a reconstruction of what the

403
00:17:16,519 --> 00:17:20,240
vegetation might have looked like in the

404
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:22,240
past uh this is from a paper we

405
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:24,798
published in 20 uh

406
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:27,519
2014 so there aren't a lot of

407
00:17:24,798 --> 00:17:28,960
macrofossil plant macrofossil localities

408
00:17:27,519 --> 00:17:31,879
from the lock

409
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:35,360
formation uh the three are Coba which is

410
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:39,440
up here kodon rupe

411
00:17:35,359 --> 00:17:42,918
and uh we think that these localities

412
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:44,440
represent Coastal Lagoon environments so

413
00:17:42,919 --> 00:17:46,720
these are essentially freshwater

414
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:48,840
environments near the coast and there

415
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:51,120
are three categories of plants that are

416
00:17:48,839 --> 00:17:53,599
preserved in these environments some of

417
00:17:51,119 --> 00:17:55,599
which were growing in the water so these

418
00:17:53,599 --> 00:17:58,639
are the things like the the water ferns

419
00:17:55,599 --> 00:18:01,119
I'll be showing uh the lumbo there there

420
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:02,759
is also a floating aquatic angiosperm

421
00:18:01,119 --> 00:18:06,639
that's maybe somewhat like

422
00:18:02,759 --> 00:18:09,119
PSA uh there are lowland Wetland plants

423
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:11,559
growing around the lagoons so the Dixon

424
00:18:09,119 --> 00:18:13,599
aous ferns that I showed you before

425
00:18:11,558 --> 00:18:15,599
would were part of this portion of the

426
00:18:13,599 --> 00:18:18,199
vegetation and then there are plants

427
00:18:15,599 --> 00:18:19,918
that are growing even further away so

428
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:23,440
there is a macrofossil flora there's

429
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:25,919
also a poino flora so pollen spores LGA

430
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,919
things like

431
00:18:27,079 --> 00:18:30,639
that all right right so the first

432
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:32,720
example I'll be showing you from this

433
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:36,480
formation is fossil

434
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:38,839
regium uh modern regium the leaf and the

435
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:40,640
megaspore are shown here on the left so

436
00:18:38,839 --> 00:18:44,000
remember the leaf with two leaflets the

437
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:46,640
megaspore with this nice acry Lela this

438
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:49,599
map summarizes the modern and fossil

439
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:52,360
distribution of regium so the present

440
00:18:49,599 --> 00:18:54,038
distribution is in a very small portion

441
00:18:52,359 --> 00:18:57,158
of East Central South America so

442
00:18:54,038 --> 00:19:00,599
Northern Argentina Uruguay uh Southern

443
00:18:57,159 --> 00:19:03,039
Brazil um uh and the fossil record is

444
00:19:00,599 --> 00:19:04,959
kind of all over the place sparse but

445
00:19:03,038 --> 00:19:06,798
widely dispersed so you'll notice a

446
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:10,000
bunch of Spore records here these are

447
00:19:06,798 --> 00:19:13,119
the red circles in Eurasia and then a

448
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:15,839
few scattered macro and misof fossil

449
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:17,678
reports so down here is an example of

450
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:21,000
one of these fossil spores from

451
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:23,679
Kazakhstan with a nice acry Lela uh

452
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:26,279
here's an example of fossil leaves these

453
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:29,038
are from Russia and then this fossil

454
00:19:26,279 --> 00:19:31,720
spor Carp from Georgia in the United

455
00:19:29,038 --> 00:19:33,400
States which doesn't look like much but

456
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:36,240
it had very nicely preserved spores in

457
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:38,960
it so don't judge it by its

458
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:41,480
cover all right so here are the fossils

459
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:44,360
from La Colonia so again moderns on the

460
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:47,319
left Center are the fossil are the macro

461
00:19:44,359 --> 00:19:50,199
fossils and then on the right are

462
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:52,879
dispersed spores from the sediments so

463
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:56,880
this gets us to one problem working as a

464
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:58,960
paleobotanist in general plant organs

465
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:01,880
are often not found in a

466
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:04,079
attachment and uh plant pollen and

467
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:05,760
spores are often not found in situ so

468
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:08,798
they're not found within the organs that

469
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:09,558
produce them so we have not found spores

470
00:20:08,798 --> 00:20:13,918
of

471
00:20:09,558 --> 00:20:16,079
marcelia within the organs of the regium

472
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:17,759
macrofossils we're assuming these two

473
00:20:16,079 --> 00:20:19,759
things go together because they're found

474
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:22,359
in the same deposits they're coming from

475
00:20:19,759 --> 00:20:25,000
the same family everything else fits in

476
00:20:22,359 --> 00:20:27,158
terms of the morphology so this plant

477
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:30,279
was probably producing these

478
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:33,200
spores so you'll notice the macrofossils

479
00:20:30,279 --> 00:20:34,720
have pairs of leaflets to their leaves

480
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:37,919
they look almost exactly like the

481
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:40,679
moderns here are some romes here the

482
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:43,679
venation is very similar so regium has

483
00:20:40,679 --> 00:20:45,120
these dichotomizing veins and also a

484
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:48,480
marginal

485
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:50,678
vein uh near the the apex of the leaf we

486
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:52,679
see this in the fossil as well the

487
00:20:50,679 --> 00:20:54,919
dispersed spores look very Bunch like

488
00:20:52,679 --> 00:20:57,559
modern ridium spores and you can compare

489
00:20:54,919 --> 00:21:00,000
the mega spores here to here they look

490
00:20:57,558 --> 00:21:02,158
very similar so as a paleobotanist this

491
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,558
is the easiest scenario it looks just

492
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:05,960
like the modern plant there's not really

493
00:21:03,558 --> 00:21:05,960
much to

494
00:21:07,159 --> 00:21:13,360
say but the next example is a little

495
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:16,440
trickier and before I get into it I just

496
00:21:13,359 --> 00:21:17,839
want to talk about marcelia a little bit

497
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:19,798
uh so these are some examples of

498
00:21:17,839 --> 00:21:23,000
marcelia again with the leaves that look

499
00:21:19,798 --> 00:21:25,519
like fourleaf clovers uh modern marcilia

500
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,839
probably has 50 or more

501
00:21:25,519 --> 00:21:29,000
species uh distributed all over the

502
00:21:27,839 --> 00:21:31,558
world

503
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,278
they produce nice sporocarps which

504
00:21:31,558 --> 00:21:36,879
sometimes have these projections called

505
00:21:33,278 --> 00:21:40,679
teeth and the megaspores do not have

506
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:42,840
these uh a very uh elaborate aamel on

507
00:21:40,679 --> 00:21:44,880
the tip it's reduced to this

508
00:21:42,839 --> 00:21:48,038
Rim all

509
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:51,200
right so marcelia tends to be fairly

510
00:21:48,038 --> 00:21:53,319
problematic in the fossil record it's

511
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:57,038
probably the most problematic member of

512
00:21:53,319 --> 00:21:58,960
of Marcel AC maybe svenes in general and

513
00:21:57,038 --> 00:22:00,599
one of the reasons for that is because

514
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:02,278
there are things that look like marcelia

515
00:22:00,599 --> 00:22:06,000
in the fossil record that aren't

516
00:22:02,278 --> 00:22:09,079
marcelia these are some examples of of

517
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:11,240
marcilia lookalikes that are probably

518
00:22:09,079 --> 00:22:14,119
angiosperms the reproductive structures

519
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:16,480
haven't been found but the leaf vation

520
00:22:14,119 --> 00:22:20,000
looks angiospermous so one of these is

521
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:23,038
Marcel ailum John Holi from the DOR Goa

522
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:25,798
formation of Kansas uh notice this has

523
00:22:23,038 --> 00:22:27,720
three leaves or leaflets and a whirl

524
00:22:25,798 --> 00:22:31,038
kind of a similar structure to marcelia

525
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:32,679
Lea and then over here for tunar cides

526
00:22:31,038 --> 00:22:35,400
uh this comes from the upper Cretaceous

527
00:22:32,679 --> 00:22:37,720
Talos of western Canada and the United

528
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:39,759
States so there are lookalikes in the

529
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:42,480
fossil record it does complicate things

530
00:22:39,759 --> 00:22:45,079
a lot also marcelia leaflets have very

531
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:47,440
simple venation it's easy to mix them up

532
00:22:45,079 --> 00:22:50,000
to with other reticulate veined things

533
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:53,919
in the fossil

534
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:57,679
record so this is uh after a review I

535
00:22:53,919 --> 00:23:00,120
did in 2019 what I think is the uh I

536
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:03,120
guess legitimate fossil record of

537
00:23:00,119 --> 00:23:05,599
marcelia uh you'll notice that marcelia

538
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:07,158
is spread around the world not in the

539
00:23:05,599 --> 00:23:09,719
southern hemisphere so much but in the

540
00:23:07,159 --> 00:23:13,000
northern hemisphere um in terms of its

541
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:16,480
fossil record there are a lot of spores

542
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:19,000
in Eurasia and some sporify reports

543
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:21,759
based on leaves from North America and

544
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:23,759
also Europe uh the leaf records come

545
00:23:21,759 --> 00:23:26,319
from the upper Cretaceous and also the

546
00:23:23,759 --> 00:23:28,759
es one of the interesting things about

547
00:23:26,319 --> 00:23:32,480
this record is that all of the Spore

548
00:23:28,759 --> 00:23:35,440
records are younger than all of the leaf

549
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:38,759
records and one debate in the literature

550
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:42,360
about marcilia is whether ancient

551
00:23:38,759 --> 00:23:44,079
marcelas produced a different Spore type

552
00:23:42,359 --> 00:23:45,359
maybe a Spore type that was similar to

553
00:23:44,079 --> 00:23:48,720
that of modern

554
00:23:45,359 --> 00:23:51,519
regium as it turns out we don't know

555
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:54,120
because no marcelia spores have been

556
00:23:51,519 --> 00:23:55,440
found in the same sediments or marcelia

557
00:23:54,119 --> 00:23:58,678
spores have been found in the same

558
00:23:55,440 --> 00:24:02,200
sediments that yield these leaves so

559
00:23:58,679 --> 00:24:02,200
this is still an open

560
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:07,960
question so in the lot Colonia formation

561
00:24:05,599 --> 00:24:10,240
we do have a plant that's a little bit

562
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:12,679
like marcelia but it's a little bit

563
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:14,759
different so on the left are some Modern

564
00:24:12,679 --> 00:24:17,798
marcelia are pictures of modern marcilia

565
00:24:14,759 --> 00:24:19,200
leaves and leaf bation on the right are

566
00:24:17,798 --> 00:24:22,879
mirita

567
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:26,000
ensus uh leaves or leaflets so the

568
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:28,399
vation of mirita ensus is very similar

569
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,558
to the vation of marcelia the veins

570
00:24:28,398 --> 00:24:32,398
dichotomize and the an asmos and they

571
00:24:30,558 --> 00:24:35,240
form these closed

572
00:24:32,398 --> 00:24:37,479
Aerials what's different is first of all

573
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:40,880
the form of the leaflet so you can see

574
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:44,159
this extended leaflet base and maybe

575
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:47,640
more of a fan-shaped leaflet NEOS Solita

576
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:50,200
versus these OB deltoid leaflets in

577
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:53,720
marcelia the whole Leaf structure was

578
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:56,880
also probably different so here we have

579
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:59,079
two leaflets in attachment here we have

580
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:00,720
a whole bunch of leaflets on the surface

581
00:24:59,079 --> 00:25:03,278
of a rock and it's hard to tell how

582
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:04,960
they're related to one another so we

583
00:25:03,278 --> 00:25:07,000
interpreted the leaves of this plant as

584
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:09,000
having two leaflets so somewhat

585
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:11,278
different from Modern marcilia but with

586
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,278
some

587
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:16,840
similarities uh just for completeness

588
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:19,839
here these sporocarps occur co-occur

589
00:25:16,839 --> 00:25:22,278
with the mosola leaves so another

590
00:25:19,839 --> 00:25:24,558
problem in paleobotany again organs tend

591
00:25:22,278 --> 00:25:26,398
to be detached we did not find the

592
00:25:24,558 --> 00:25:28,678
sporocarps in attachment with the

593
00:25:26,398 --> 00:25:30,079
leaflets so we give them different name

594
00:25:28,679 --> 00:25:32,679
even though we think they probably come

595
00:25:30,079 --> 00:25:34,158
from the same plant uh over here in the

596
00:25:32,679 --> 00:25:37,880
upper right you can see one of the

597
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:40,360
Molita leaflets near some sporocarps so

598
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:42,600
they occur very close to one another

599
00:25:40,359 --> 00:25:45,158
there are also mosor spores in these

600
00:25:42,599 --> 00:25:48,439
sediments so it's possible that this

601
00:25:45,159 --> 00:25:50,960
mirita luigio Maria plant was also

602
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:54,038
producing mosor fores that's really the

603
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:54,038
only candidate right

604
00:25:54,558 --> 00:26:00,519
now all right so to wrap up this section

605
00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:02,600
uh late Cretaceous regium was similar in

606
00:26:00,519 --> 00:26:05,839
form in terms of its leaves and spores

607
00:26:02,599 --> 00:26:07,959
to Modern regium so maybe an example of

608
00:26:05,839 --> 00:26:10,398
some extreme stasis going on there from

609
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:13,079
over 66 million years ago to the

610
00:26:10,398 --> 00:26:16,359
present but in the Cretaceous and

611
00:26:13,079 --> 00:26:18,278
possibly even later marcelous plants may

612
00:26:16,359 --> 00:26:19,439
have had characteristics of more than

613
00:26:18,278 --> 00:26:22,278
one modern

614
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:24,240
genus and or they may have had unique

615
00:26:22,278 --> 00:26:27,278
characteristics not seen in modern

616
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:29,880
marcelous plants so this is what we get

617
00:26:27,278 --> 00:26:32,200
out of the law Colonia

618
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:34,480
formation so for the remainder of the

619
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:38,480
time I'd like to briefly go through some

620
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:41,880
projects to do with salvin so aola and

621
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:44,839
salvinia these floating

622
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:48,000
Aquatics so I'm going to uh go through

623
00:26:44,839 --> 00:26:50,038
two scenarios here one involving svenia

624
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,480
that has sporify characters not found in

625
00:26:50,038 --> 00:26:53,720
the extant plants uh this study is

626
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:56,360
actually not published yet it's

627
00:26:53,720 --> 00:27:00,038
something I'm working on with fundo Dei

628
00:26:56,359 --> 00:27:01,959
and so we did an abstract GSA last year

629
00:27:00,038 --> 00:27:05,839
and then the second one is a published

630
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:07,960
study from 2019 on aola spores and

631
00:27:05,839 --> 00:27:11,398
spores from the LA Colonia formation and

632
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:11,399
the younger salanka

633
00:27:14,599 --> 00:27:19,359
formation all right so a little bit

634
00:27:17,038 --> 00:27:22,278
about svenia just to get us acquainted

635
00:27:19,359 --> 00:27:24,599
with this plant uh svenia plants are

636
00:27:22,278 --> 00:27:27,240
floating Aquatics uh you can see here

637
00:27:24,599 --> 00:27:28,839
from Q the modern distribution of svenia

638
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:31,640
they're native to large parts of the

639
00:27:28,839 --> 00:27:33,158
world but they are also introduced to

640
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:35,240
large parts of the world where they can

641
00:27:33,159 --> 00:27:39,520
cause some problems so one thing svenia

642
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:40,798
is KN as is an Evas in as is an invasive

643
00:27:39,519 --> 00:27:42,839
aquatic

644
00:27:40,798 --> 00:27:45,519
plant uh the

645
00:27:42,839 --> 00:27:48,639
plants uh grow on the surface of the

646
00:27:45,519 --> 00:27:52,759
water uh they have horizontally growing

647
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:56,640
Ryon or stems that bear leaves in groups

648
00:27:52,759 --> 00:27:59,640
of three so they have uh pairs of

649
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:01,360
floating leaves which isn't really well

650
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:03,679
visualized here but the floating leaves

651
00:28:01,359 --> 00:28:06,918
occur in pairs they can occur flat on

652
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:08,759
the water surface or somewhat folded up

653
00:28:06,919 --> 00:28:11,038
and then each of these is associated

654
00:28:08,759 --> 00:28:13,720
with a submerged leaf and the submerged

655
00:28:11,038 --> 00:28:16,640
Leaf is a root likee looking structure

656
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:20,079
so these plants have no true roots and

657
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:22,519
it's the submerged leaves that bear the

658
00:28:20,079 --> 00:28:25,678
Sor uh the floating leaves have

659
00:28:22,519 --> 00:28:28,159
reticulate Leaf vation so the aiel is

660
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:30,480
formed by the ve

661
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:33,960
tend to be elongate rectangular to

662
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:36,360
hexagonal in shape and svenia is really

663
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:38,399
known particularly in the literature and

664
00:28:36,359 --> 00:28:41,759
materials research for his

665
00:28:38,398 --> 00:28:44,278
hairs uh some Cenas not all of them have

666
00:28:41,759 --> 00:28:46,119
egg beater hairs so here's an example of

667
00:28:44,278 --> 00:28:48,798
these egg beater hairs these are

668
00:28:46,119 --> 00:28:51,359
hydrophobic hairs which with hydrophilic

669
00:28:48,798 --> 00:28:53,240
tips and they help the water if you drop

670
00:28:51,359 --> 00:28:55,918
a a drop of water on a surface of a

671
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:58,120
salvinia leaf it'll beat up and it helps

672
00:28:55,919 --> 00:29:01,038
air hold air against the surface of the

673
00:28:58,119 --> 00:29:03,518
leaf so this is probably an adaptation

674
00:29:01,038 --> 00:29:03,519
to its

675
00:29:04,038 --> 00:29:08,440
habitat so just a little bit more about

676
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:10,320
the reproductive structures I mentioned

677
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:14,759
that they are on the submerged

678
00:29:10,319 --> 00:29:19,119
leaves remember that the Sor are homos

679
00:29:14,759 --> 00:29:22,960
spria so some sorai had meas spria that

680
00:29:19,119 --> 00:29:25,038
produced megaspores other spria have um

681
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:27,360
other sorai have microsporangia that

682
00:29:25,038 --> 00:29:29,960
produce microspores so megaspores and

683
00:29:27,359 --> 00:29:33,079
microspores are separated into different

684
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:34,798
Sor uh these are just examples of the

685
00:29:33,079 --> 00:29:36,678
megaspores and microspores I'm not

686
00:29:34,798 --> 00:29:39,440
really going to talk about the spor

687
00:29:36,679 --> 00:29:41,559
structure today note the megaspores are

688
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:45,000
much much larger than the microspores so

689
00:29:41,558 --> 00:29:45,000
these pictures are not to

690
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:50,440
skip in terms of the fossil record of

691
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,759
svenia I kind of feel like this is maybe

692
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:55,278
the neglected record of all the water

693
00:29:52,759 --> 00:29:57,038
ferns uh there actually is a pretty good

694
00:29:55,278 --> 00:29:58,038
literature in this case on the scor

695
00:29:57,038 --> 00:30:01,038
fites

696
00:29:58,038 --> 00:30:03,319
interestingly enough so the map up here

697
00:30:01,038 --> 00:30:05,319
shows the fossil record or distribution

698
00:30:03,319 --> 00:30:07,918
of the fossil record of

699
00:30:05,319 --> 00:30:11,079
svenia um notably there are some

700
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:14,159
Cretaceous occurrences so in North

701
00:30:11,079 --> 00:30:16,359
America here's one that is not described

702
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:19,320
so again we have one of these groups

703
00:30:16,359 --> 00:30:21,119
going back to the Cretaceous and these

704
00:30:19,319 --> 00:30:24,839
pictures just show some of the variety

705
00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:26,918
of fossil Cenas um all of them look very

706
00:30:24,839 --> 00:30:29,720
much like the modern forms in terms of

707
00:30:26,919 --> 00:30:29,720
their overall

708
00:30:34,038 --> 00:30:38,480
structure oh and I should mention not on

709
00:30:36,599 --> 00:30:40,319
this map there are some reports from

710
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:44,079
Africa including a late Cretaceous

711
00:30:40,319 --> 00:30:46,960
report and some much younger

712
00:30:44,079 --> 00:30:49,038
reports okay so the fossils I will be

713
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:51,278
showing today come from the Hattisburg

714
00:30:49,038 --> 00:30:54,398
formation of Mississippi this is also

715
00:30:51,278 --> 00:30:56,398
known as the buoy River Site uh the site

716
00:30:54,398 --> 00:30:59,239
was first reported in the literature in

717
00:30:56,398 --> 00:31:01,879
detail in 201 2019 by mcol and

718
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:03,880
paleontologia Electronica if some of you

719
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:05,720
were here when M Alfred was a graduate

720
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:08,600
student he was on that paper so you may

721
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:10,360
remember him um one of the interesting

722
00:31:08,599 --> 00:31:14,719
things about this site is it's one of

723
00:31:10,359 --> 00:31:17,558
the few neogene fossil plant macrofossil

724
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:19,679
localities in eastern North America so

725
00:31:17,558 --> 00:31:21,879
there are very few neogene plant

726
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:23,960
macrofossil sites in the eastern part of

727
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:26,080
the United States the neogene is 23

728
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:28,600
million years ago to 2.6 million years

729
00:31:26,079 --> 00:31:30,359
ago so this part of the fossil record is

730
00:31:28,599 --> 00:31:33,240
really relevant for understanding our

731
00:31:30,359 --> 00:31:35,839
modern Flora understanding modern plant

732
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:41,200
disjunctions and things like that uh the

733
00:31:35,839 --> 00:31:43,398
best neogene record in uh in our country

734
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:45,278
in the eastern part of our country is in

735
00:31:43,398 --> 00:31:47,518
the Gulf Coast Area so you'll see sort

736
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:49,638
of a cluster of sites down here these

737
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:52,240
are the major sites there are other

738
00:31:49,638 --> 00:31:55,319
sites um that are maybe a bit more minor

739
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:59,159
or haven't been worked up so Hattiesburg

740
00:31:55,319 --> 00:31:59,158
yields leaves fruits seeds and

741
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:04,798
pollen and it yields

742
00:32:02,119 --> 00:32:06,959
svenia so this fossil might be a little

743
00:32:04,798 --> 00:32:09,638
bit harder to interpret than some of the

744
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:12,079
ones I showed previously it's not quite

745
00:32:09,638 --> 00:32:15,599
as well preserved The Matrix it is in

746
00:32:12,079 --> 00:32:17,240
falls apart if you even look at it um

747
00:32:15,599 --> 00:32:19,359
but you'll notice there are pairs of

748
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:21,200
floating leaves here there's another

749
00:32:19,359 --> 00:32:23,079
Floating Leaf here that's preserved sort

750
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:25,880
of face on so it's a little bit easier

751
00:32:23,079 --> 00:32:28,720
to see there's a submerged Leaf down

752
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:32,000
here the branches are visible

753
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:34,000
there um and there are there's a sorus

754
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:37,839
here so there are some very nice presure

755
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:39,919
of sorai on these and then there is a

756
00:32:37,839 --> 00:32:42,359
poorly preserved structure here called a

757
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:45,080
float so you'll see the corresponding

758
00:32:42,359 --> 00:32:47,479
structures on a modern svenia plant

759
00:32:45,079 --> 00:32:50,278
except for the

760
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:53,038
float because it turns out floats are

761
00:32:50,278 --> 00:32:54,638
not seen on Modern svenia this is

762
00:32:53,038 --> 00:32:58,038
something that's only been documented

763
00:32:54,638 --> 00:33:00,278
from fossils so here on the a ARs and in

764
00:32:58,038 --> 00:33:02,158
this this blow up in the center are some

765
00:33:00,278 --> 00:33:05,079
other pictures of the floats in this

766
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:07,240
Hattisburg svenia these are also called

767
00:33:05,079 --> 00:33:10,359
literature inflated structures which is

768
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:12,038
maybe a little bit more neutral nobody

769
00:33:10,359 --> 00:33:13,079
knows exactly what the function of these

770
00:33:12,038 --> 00:33:16,359
things

771
00:33:13,079 --> 00:33:19,278
are um but they have been found in other

772
00:33:16,359 --> 00:33:21,599
fossils so here are some fossil svenia

773
00:33:19,278 --> 00:33:23,919
from Colombia uh here's the actual

774
00:33:21,599 --> 00:33:26,240
fossil here's a drawing reconstructing

775
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:29,759
what's going on these are some floats

776
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:32,399
from uh esine svenia so this is older

777
00:33:29,759 --> 00:33:34,480
than the Hattisburg material up here are

778
00:33:32,398 --> 00:33:37,599
some examples from Europe which are

779
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:39,120
slightly older to about the same age as

780
00:33:37,599 --> 00:33:41,119
the Hattisburg

781
00:33:39,119 --> 00:33:43,719
material so this is sort of an

782
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:45,359
interesting observation not sure where

783
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:48,079
it's going to go

784
00:33:45,359 --> 00:33:51,240
yet the other thing that's interesting

785
00:33:48,079 --> 00:33:53,678
about the Hattisburg svenia are the

786
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:57,679
sorai so in these

787
00:33:53,679 --> 00:34:01,159
fossils the mega spria marked by m

788
00:33:57,679 --> 00:34:02,559
and the micros spria marked by Mi occur

789
00:34:01,159 --> 00:34:05,600
in the same

790
00:34:02,558 --> 00:34:07,720
sorus so the Sor are heteros sprang

791
00:34:05,599 --> 00:34:11,118
they're producing both megaspores and

792
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:13,960
microspores in modern svenia the typical

793
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:17,280
case I guess there have been some uh

794
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:19,440
observations of of very occasional

795
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:22,519
observations of heteros sprang Sor but

796
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:24,480
the typical case is this one where

797
00:34:22,519 --> 00:34:27,719
there's a micros sprent sorus producing

798
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:29,240
the microspores and a megas sprang sorus

799
00:34:27,719 --> 00:34:30,918
producing the

800
00:34:29,239 --> 00:34:34,158
megaspores

801
00:34:30,918 --> 00:34:36,118
um peteris brate Sor and svenia have

802
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:39,240
been documented previously in the fossil

803
00:34:36,119 --> 00:34:42,480
record so again this is a character we

804
00:34:39,239 --> 00:34:45,678
don't really see in modern

805
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:45,679
taxa all

806
00:34:46,358 --> 00:34:54,000
right final example quickly is aola the

807
00:34:50,039 --> 00:34:56,199
mosquito ferns so aola are really tiny

808
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:58,079
floating ferns you can see uh in the

809
00:34:56,199 --> 00:35:00,399
upper Center there a picture of one of

810
00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:02,880
these on somebody's finger so they're

811
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:07,160
very small ferns they have horizontally

812
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:09,200
growing stems or ryom that bear simple

813
00:35:07,159 --> 00:35:12,639
leaves that are imcat so the leaves

814
00:35:09,199 --> 00:35:15,838
overlap one another and they have roots

815
00:35:12,639 --> 00:35:21,159
that hang down into the water

816
00:35:15,838 --> 00:35:23,880
column um like svenia the sorai in aola

817
00:35:21,159 --> 00:35:25,639
are either meas sprang or micros sprang

818
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:28,119
so in the herbarium specimen here you

819
00:35:25,639 --> 00:35:30,598
can see some micros sprang sorai the

820
00:35:28,119 --> 00:35:33,160
micros sprang at sorai are often more

821
00:35:30,599 --> 00:35:35,880
conspicuous because they have multiple

822
00:35:33,159 --> 00:35:38,159
microsporangia the meas sprent sorai

823
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:40,599
only have one megasporangium producing

824
00:35:38,159 --> 00:35:44,639
one megaspore each and they're sort of

825
00:35:40,599 --> 00:35:47,400
ooid in shape uh the leaves of aola have

826
00:35:44,639 --> 00:35:50,358
cavities in them that Harbor

827
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:52,318
cyanobacteria these are nitrogen fixing

828
00:35:50,358 --> 00:35:55,078
cyanobacteria uh this is one of the

829
00:35:52,318 --> 00:35:58,599
things that makes aola economic interest

830
00:35:55,079 --> 00:36:01,280
because it can be used to help enrich

831
00:35:58,599 --> 00:36:02,440
soil uh this is the distribution of

832
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:05,640
modern

833
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:08,079
Zola uh the species boundaries of some

834
00:36:05,639 --> 00:36:10,000
of these are a little bit fuzzy but it

835
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:13,160
just gives you the idea that it occurs

836
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,159
widely throughout the

837
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:19,880
world all right the spores of aola are

838
00:36:17,079 --> 00:36:23,400
also really really interesting so the

839
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:26,200
microspores occur in groups in a matrix

840
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:27,318
and these groups are known as mulite and

841
00:36:26,199 --> 00:36:29,239
the mass

842
00:36:27,318 --> 00:36:30,800
actually have hairs on them these hairs

843
00:36:29,239 --> 00:36:33,719
are sometimes called

844
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:36,039
gidia and a lot of AAS the hairs have

845
00:36:33,719 --> 00:36:39,358
these anchor-shaped or Arrow shaped tips

846
00:36:36,039 --> 00:36:42,000
on the end and some they don't and some

847
00:36:39,358 --> 00:36:43,559
the tips might just be pointed or

848
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,880
especially in the fossa record you see

849
00:36:43,559 --> 00:36:47,400
some that are cers it so they're curled

850
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:50,358
almost like a young

851
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:53,480
Fern the megaspores are also pretty

852
00:36:50,358 --> 00:36:55,400
spectacular they're very complex uh

853
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:57,679
they're sometimes called megaspore

854
00:36:55,400 --> 00:37:01,160
apparatuses so so the megaspore has a

855
00:36:57,679 --> 00:37:04,039
megaspore body sometimes it has this Rim

856
00:37:01,159 --> 00:37:06,358
called a collar and at one end it has

857
00:37:04,039 --> 00:37:09,358
these structures that are called

858
00:37:06,358 --> 00:37:12,159
floats in modern Isola there can be

859
00:37:09,358 --> 00:37:16,480
three floats in one tier or nine floats

860
00:37:12,159 --> 00:37:16,480
in two tiers on the megaspore

861
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:27,079
apparatus and there is sorting in aola

862
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:29,240
by Clay the three floated species and

863
00:37:27,079 --> 00:37:32,240
the species with anchor tipped gidia

864
00:37:29,239 --> 00:37:35,318
occurr in one clay section aola and the

865
00:37:32,239 --> 00:37:37,399
nine floated uh species that either have

866
00:37:35,318 --> 00:37:40,119
no hairs on their mascula or simple

867
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:43,280
hairs so not anchor-shaped hips are in

868
00:37:40,119 --> 00:37:43,280
section risos

869
00:37:44,599 --> 00:37:49,800
Sperma so the fossil record of aola is

870
00:37:48,239 --> 00:37:52,318
um

871
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:54,920
extensive the map up here just shows the

872
00:37:52,318 --> 00:37:56,679
sporify record notice again we have a

873
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:58,920
lot of records from the northern hemis

874
00:37:56,679 --> 00:38:01,239
isphere not a lot from the southern

875
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:03,960
hemisphere this is really probably

876
00:38:01,239 --> 00:38:06,159
reflective of of collecting effort and

877
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:07,800
publication um opportunities more than

878
00:38:06,159 --> 00:38:10,598
it is maybe

879
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:13,440
reality um so the Spore record begins in

880
00:38:10,599 --> 00:38:15,119
the late early Cretaceous the albian

881
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:17,800
interestingly there are a lot of multif

882
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:19,599
flated species of aola megaspore

883
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:22,640
apparatuses so these would be

884
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:24,318
apparatuses with more than nine floats

885
00:38:22,639 --> 00:38:25,519
and they occur from the lake Cretaceous

886
00:38:24,318 --> 00:38:27,759
to the

887
00:38:25,519 --> 00:38:29,119
eosine so maybe this gives some

888
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:31,880
impression that there's a little bit of

889
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:34,760
directionality in the evolution of these

890
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:36,760
species um the sporify record is known

891
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:39,880
from the lake Cretaceous to the Meine

892
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:42,160
and they're about 14 species so the two

893
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:44,680
I'll show today are from South

894
00:38:42,159 --> 00:38:46,838
America uh the first of these aola

895
00:38:44,679 --> 00:38:49,039
coloni Anis comes from the LA Colonia

896
00:38:46,838 --> 00:38:51,358
formation which I talked about earlier

897
00:38:49,039 --> 00:38:54,199
with regium and

898
00:38:51,358 --> 00:38:56,759
Molita uh on the left are the

899
00:38:54,199 --> 00:39:00,000
sporophytes I don't necessarily have a

900
00:38:56,760 --> 00:39:01,680
lot to say about these um they're not so

901
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,239
different from Modern aola and their

902
00:39:01,679 --> 00:39:06,078
structure there might be a slight

903
00:39:03,239 --> 00:39:08,919
difference in the leaves uh you can see

904
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:11,720
uh a mega sprang sorus here and micros

905
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:15,000
sprang sorai down here one of the

906
00:39:11,719 --> 00:39:16,719
interesting things about this uh species

907
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:20,039
is that it's associated with these

908
00:39:16,719 --> 00:39:22,519
spores so these are linked under the

909
00:39:20,039 --> 00:39:25,039
same name aola coloni Enis but the

910
00:39:22,519 --> 00:39:28,358
spores have not been found in C2 they've

911
00:39:25,039 --> 00:39:30,440
been found dispersed in the sediments so

912
00:39:28,358 --> 00:39:33,358
the megaspore apparatuses have many

913
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:36,159
floats 18 to greater than 20 the

914
00:39:33,358 --> 00:39:38,000
microser masul have these uh hairs with

915
00:39:36,159 --> 00:39:41,719
anchor-shaped tips and these were

916
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,719
described by De Benedetti at all in

917
00:39:45,039 --> 00:39:49,800
2018 there's another species of aola

918
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:52,240
from a slightly younger formation this

919
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:56,119
is the solomona formation it's danan in

920
00:39:52,239 --> 00:39:57,039
age so about 66 to 61.6 million years

921
00:39:56,119 --> 00:39:58,720
old

922
00:39:57,039 --> 00:40:01,480
it also comes from tribut Province

923
00:39:58,719 --> 00:40:06,318
Argentina so the same general region as

924
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:08,599
the LA Colonia uh uh the LA Colonia

925
00:40:06,318 --> 00:40:12,358
formation the interesting thing about

926
00:40:08,599 --> 00:40:15,838
the sporo fites of aola CA is that the

927
00:40:12,358 --> 00:40:18,480
uh Roots occur in fasal so they occur in

928
00:40:15,838 --> 00:40:20,679
these big groups on the sporify and

929
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:23,039
they're very much like a modern species

930
00:40:20,679 --> 00:40:24,598
called aola nilotica which is native

931
00:40:23,039 --> 00:40:27,960
only to

932
00:40:24,599 --> 00:40:30,720
Africa the spor the megaspore

933
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:33,199
apparatuses have uh six floats and one

934
00:40:30,719 --> 00:40:34,838
tier unfortunately these could not be

935
00:40:33,199 --> 00:40:38,159
directly observed because they're under

936
00:40:34,838 --> 00:40:41,279
a cap so this interpretation is based on

937
00:40:38,159 --> 00:40:44,000
impressions in that cap the microspore

938
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:45,960
masculi have these spin like hairs so

939
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:48,920
they don't have the anchor-shaped

940
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:50,280
ends so one of the interesting things to

941
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:52,559
note about

942
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:55,599
this is

943
00:40:52,559 --> 00:40:58,039
uh the complication it presents for

944
00:40:55,599 --> 00:41:01,960
understanding the evolution U of aola so

945
00:40:58,039 --> 00:41:04,279
in addition to AAA and aola nyoa there's

946
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:06,960
another fossil species with these fasold

947
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:09,760
roots a Sola shopi that comes from the

948
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:13,559
paleos scene of Canada so it's a similar

949
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:17,440
age to the Argentinian material but this

950
00:41:13,559 --> 00:41:19,440
aola has multif flated megaspore

951
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:21,880
apparatuses so what these things are

952
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:24,159
suggesting is that there really isn't if

953
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:26,400
they're part of the same lineage which

954
00:41:24,159 --> 00:41:28,159
we kind of think they might be because

955
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:30,838
have these fic roots and some other

956
00:41:28,159 --> 00:41:33,118
features that are similar there isn't a

957
00:41:30,838 --> 00:41:36,400
clear directionality in the number of

958
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:39,000
floats on the scores we've got 15 to to

959
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:41,838
more than 20 in this one six in this one

960
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,838
and then nine in the

961
00:41:43,838 --> 00:41:48,679
modern all right so to conclude this

962
00:41:46,679 --> 00:41:50,879
part of the talk uh fossil aola and

963
00:41:48,679 --> 00:41:53,239
svenia species have some characteristics

964
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:55,358
not seen in the modern forms and the

965
00:41:53,239 --> 00:41:57,000
fossil record of aola really complicates

966
00:41:55,358 --> 00:42:00,480
our understanding of morphological

967
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:03,079
evolution in the genus so I guess to

968
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:05,199
conclude the fossil record adds a lot of

969
00:42:03,079 --> 00:42:07,680
richness to our understanding of the

970
00:42:05,199 --> 00:42:09,838
morphology of the water Ferns and

971
00:42:07,679 --> 00:42:11,440
potentially uh to our understanding of

972
00:42:09,838 --> 00:42:14,039
their evolution particularly the

973
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:16,119
morphological character Evolution but

974
00:42:14,039 --> 00:42:19,159
there's a lot of danger maybe in over

975
00:42:16,119 --> 00:42:22,680
interpreting things or in misidentifying

976
00:42:19,159 --> 00:42:25,159
things especially in Marcel AC so um I

977
00:42:22,679 --> 00:42:28,159
think with that I'll take any

978
00:42:25,159 --> 00:42:28,159
questions

979
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:33,760
yes do you think that the S of floats

980
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:37,159
might be involving sybis given you know

981
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:40,079
AA has that Sant bacteria in in the

982
00:42:37,159 --> 00:42:42,399
leaves um it's an interesting question

983
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:45,519
and I have no idea and the flows this

984
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:47,079
supposedly a leaf structure or they look

985
00:42:45,519 --> 00:42:49,358
like a leaf-like structure so if you

986
00:42:47,079 --> 00:42:50,920
look at them they have uh like a very

987
00:42:49,358 --> 00:42:53,920
thick mid VIN on them and they have

988
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:59,599
reticulate vation so they do look like

989
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:59,599
sort of some sort of modified Lea

990
00:43:00,199 --> 00:43:05,558
yeah yes do you know the fs you talked

991
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:09,119
about are in greeding or out Crossing

992
00:43:05,559 --> 00:43:12,800
and if that depends on which spce they

993
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:15,318
produce um no I do

994
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:17,039
not so I'm sorry I can't answer that

995
00:43:15,318 --> 00:43:20,679
question

996
00:43:17,039 --> 00:43:23,800
but yes have to question very nice thank

997
00:43:20,679 --> 00:43:26,399
you so the what's the function of Thea

998
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:28,640
how does it work for fertilization just

999
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:33,639
curious my first question and second one

1000
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:37,679
is like um Mar Marc had this parallel

1001
00:43:33,639 --> 00:43:39,920
veins but the Salin has more it is

1002
00:43:37,679 --> 00:43:43,719
possible that the extinct plants had

1003
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:47,200
this gestal gestor had different kind of

1004
00:43:43,719 --> 00:43:49,239
a Nation so might be not just parallel

1005
00:43:47,199 --> 00:43:51,598
might be something different because the

1006
00:43:49,239 --> 00:43:54,318
Sister Clay has a different time of the

1007
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:57,000
nation right so

1008
00:43:54,318 --> 00:43:59,838
um I'm not sure about about the solid

1009
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:04,800
acry Lela to address your first question

1010
00:43:59,838 --> 00:44:07,920
if I can get out here or maybe I can

1011
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:09,559
anyway um I was going to go back to one

1012
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:12,079
of the earlier slides so the the

1013
00:44:09,559 --> 00:44:14,559
gelatinous spell there is a sperm Lake

1014
00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:16,559
inside where the sperm gather uh prior

1015
00:44:14,559 --> 00:44:18,800
to fertilization and there's really nice

1016
00:44:16,559 --> 00:44:20,359
paper on it I think by Schneider and

1017
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:22,960
prior that talks all about the

1018
00:44:20,358 --> 00:44:24,838
Fertilization in these FMS so I'm not

1019
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:27,838
sure how much the solid AC Lelo is

1020
00:44:24,838 --> 00:44:31,039
involved in that um the other question

1021
00:44:27,838 --> 00:44:32,880
was about the venation so marcelia

1022
00:44:31,039 --> 00:44:35,000
actually does have reticulate venation

1023
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:38,800
the venation in in svenia is more

1024
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:41,239
complex certainly and regium has

1025
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:42,760
dichotomizing um so in terms of the

1026
00:44:41,239 --> 00:44:45,199
ancestral

1027
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:49,640
Fern uh my guess would be it's probably

1028
00:44:45,199 --> 00:44:53,519
dichotomizing but yeah there isn't there

1029
00:44:49,639 --> 00:44:57,519
isn't a clear stem member of the entire

1030
00:44:53,519 --> 00:44:58,960
order in the fossil record so far

1031
00:44:57,519 --> 00:45:03,199
so where is the

1032
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:06,199
hydrum place the a lot of the analyses

1033
00:45:03,199 --> 00:45:09,318
place it as a stem member of salvin AC

1034
00:45:06,199 --> 00:45:12,558
although an alternative plement is as

1035
00:45:09,318 --> 00:45:15,920
stem salvin Alys at least in one

1036
00:45:12,559 --> 00:45:17,839
analysis that one is rooted right yeah

1037
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:20,440
so that one that one's a little bit more

1038
00:45:17,838 --> 00:45:23,639
Marcil Acy like in its structure yeah in

1039
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:26,720
terms of it's rise

1040
00:45:23,639 --> 00:45:29,318
yeah yes so

1041
00:45:26,719 --> 00:45:31,480
um weird rootlet

1042
00:45:29,318 --> 00:45:34,480
things so those are

1043
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:37,240
leaves that is the interpretation yes

1044
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:38,119
can you figure out how many are involved

1045
00:45:37,239 --> 00:45:42,000
is

1046
00:45:38,119 --> 00:45:44,119
it I mean is it one kind of stem that

1047
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:47,719
leaves on it or they coming directly off

1048
00:45:44,119 --> 00:45:50,760
the upper one or I assume that all those

1049
00:45:47,719 --> 00:45:52,959
threads are like different parts of one

1050
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:54,920
leaf right yeah I that's what I think it

1051
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:56,920
is interpreted as yeah so you think it's

1052
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:58,480
a single leaf comes down or is there

1053
00:45:56,920 --> 00:46:00,599
more than one no I think it's a single

1054
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:03,199
leave a single leave

1055
00:46:00,599 --> 00:46:06,838
yeah

1056
00:46:03,199 --> 00:46:06,838
interesting okay thank

1057
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:13,000
you this has been a production of

1058
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:16,000
Cornell University on the web at

1059
