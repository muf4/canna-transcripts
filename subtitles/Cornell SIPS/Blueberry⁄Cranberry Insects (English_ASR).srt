1
00:00:08,638 --> 00:00:12,798
in addition to teaching bob has an

2
00:00:10,638 --> 00:00:14,558
extension appointment in the landscape

3
00:00:12,798 --> 00:00:17,039
nursery and urban

4
00:00:14,558 --> 00:00:18,640
forestry program and his role there is

5
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:21,199
to provide accurate and timely

6
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:23,760
diagnostics of insect pests he also

7
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:25,679
makes recommendations for pest control

8
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,240
and writes about current trends in pest

9
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:31,839
identification and management and he

10
00:00:28,239 --> 00:00:34,000
also acts to overall resources as an

11
00:00:31,839 --> 00:00:36,880
overall resource for the green industry

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,960
in massachusetts so i'm very happy to

13
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,399

yes yes thank you laura yeah okay

20
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:57,359
i'm i'm one of the newbies here as you

21
00:00:55,759 --> 00:00:58,640
can probably tell

22
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:00,238
welcome everyone and thanks for

23
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,799
listening in today

24
00:01:00,238 --> 00:01:05,359
uh my task today is to talk to you about

25
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:08,719
winter moth which was a a new pest for

26
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:10,560
us in massachusetts for about the last

27
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:14,158
eight or nine years

28
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:16,640
and it popped up quite unexpectedly in

29
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:18,240
the landscape areas in the nursery and

30
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,239
it was after a couple of years that we

31
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:23,919
realized it was becoming a big problem

32
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:27,280
in blueberries as well we had a number

33
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:30,879
of growers in southeastern massachusetts

34
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:33,040
that experienced such damage from this

35
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:35,039
insect that they had virtually no crops

36
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:37,759
for two three years in a row until we

37
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:40,079
were able to get a handle on this so i'm

38
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:42,640
going to explain to you

39
00:01:40,078 --> 00:01:44,478
our experience and what perhaps you can

40
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:47,840
do to be on the lookout for this

41
00:01:44,478 --> 00:01:49,359
monitoring and management techniques

42
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,799
back in

43
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:52,319
2000

44
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:54,479
2001

45
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:56,158
and plymouth county massachusetts

46
00:01:54,478 --> 00:01:58,640
southeastern mass

47
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:00,479
we had an outbreak of this little insect

48
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,478
called fall cankerworm you're probably

49
00:02:00,478 --> 00:02:04,239
familiar with it it's a native

50
00:02:02,478 --> 00:02:06,159
uh inchworm

51
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:08,560
and periodically you can go into

52
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:10,800
outbreak phase and it can be a problem

53
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:13,039
for two or three years until natural

54
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,000
controls catch up to it again

55
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:16,318
and then

56
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,400
usually the way that that story goes is

57
00:02:16,318 --> 00:02:21,199
that the insect is then knocked down

58
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:23,599
into very small population numbers and

59
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:26,719
we don't see it for for quite a while

60
00:02:23,598 --> 00:02:29,839
maybe 10 15 or 20 years in that area

61
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:32,479
and population started to build of fall

62
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:34,640
cankerworm it's a little green looper as

63
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:36,959
hopefully you can see

64
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:40,479
it has a distinguishing

65
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:41,920
feature in that loopers or inch worms

66
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:44,399
only have

67
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:46,799
two to three pairs of

68
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:49,280
pro legs and i'm going to try to use the

69
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,280
pointer

70
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:56,080
which are the abdominal legs and

71
00:02:53,199 --> 00:03:00,878
bear with me i'm trying to

72
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:03,519
there we go uh the abdominal legs and

73
00:03:00,878 --> 00:03:05,919
fall cancer worm the first pair of their

74
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:08,319
pro legs are very short and it said that

75
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:11,119
it's a half a pair so

76
00:03:08,318 --> 00:03:13,439
a very distinguishing feature of fall

77
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:15,120
cankerworm is that it has two and a half

78
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:17,519
pairs of prolegs

79
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:20,239
it's usually green when the population

80
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:23,360
numbers go into high density mode

81
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:26,158
the caterpillars turn very dark black

82
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:27,760
with light colored stripes on the body

83
00:03:26,158 --> 00:03:29,439
these two caterpillars that you are

84
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:31,280
looking at now

85
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:32,479
both fall cankerworm they were both

86
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,318
collected

87
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:36,318
at the exact same time on the same

88
00:03:34,318 --> 00:03:39,280
branch on an oak tree in southeastern

89
00:03:36,318 --> 00:03:40,479
mass the population was in a phase

90
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,199
change

91
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:44,840
going to the dark color but usually

92
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:48,000
they're

93
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:51,360
green and this is what we had occurring

94
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,360
in southeastern mass

95
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:57,680
there we go

96
00:03:55,759 --> 00:04:01,719
laura i have a screen that popped up

97
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,719
that i want to get rid of here

98
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:07,920
now i've sorry there i'm back so after

99
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:10,879
uh two or three years the population of

100
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:12,878
fall cankerworm building dramatically uh

101
00:04:10,878 --> 00:04:14,878
deborah swanson our extension specialist

102
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:16,399
in southeastern mass that called me and

103
00:04:14,878 --> 00:04:18,639
she said the problem's getting worse

104
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:19,758
what do we do and i said well you know i

105
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:21,840
told you in the beginning it was

106
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:25,040
probably going to get worse for a few

107
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:26,879
years until nature uh caught up with it

108
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,720
and then she started saying you know i

109
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:30,560
don't i'm not so convinced it's fall

110
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,400
cankerworm anymore we had these other

111
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,519
little green inch worms and she sent

112
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:35,758
some to me

113
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:38,159
uh here in amherst and i immediately

114
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:39,919
realized it was not fall kangaroo we

115
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,600
still had some fall cankerworm in that

116
00:04:39,918 --> 00:04:43,359
population but mostly we had these

117
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:46,080
little green caterpillars

118
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:48,319
i spent a while trying to identify and

119
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:49,199
was pretty convinced it was not

120
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:50,319
uh

121
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:52,319
a native

122
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:55,519
insect here

123
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:58,719
i moved it on to jeff bettner and our

124
00:04:55,519 --> 00:05:00,719
department and he was unable to identify

125
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:02,880
it i went to joe elkinton our forest

126
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,160
entomologist who sent it to rick hobeck

127
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:07,360
at cornell

128
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:09,280
and also david wagner at uconn

129
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:11,360
and both of them came back almost the

130
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:14,399
same day and said you have winter month

131
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:17,600
which is native to europe

132
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:20,159
it has been known to be in nova scotia

133
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:22,560
uh since the late 1940s

134
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:25,439
and it can be problematic it's a little

135
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:28,079
geometric uh looper

136
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:30,079
and suddenly we had a new exotic here in

137
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:32,719
massachusetts

138
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:35,198
and unfortunately this is a little video

139
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:37,840
just to show you that it it just

140
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:39,919
is an innocuous looking little green

141
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:41,359
inchworm or looper but i don't believe

142
00:05:39,918 --> 00:05:44,959
we're going to get this quick time to

143
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,960
play so i will just move on

144
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:52,799
fall cankerworm

145
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:54,719
has a pretty wide host range this native

146
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,720
caterpillar is found on oaks and maples

147
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:59,360
birches crab apples and a number of

148
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:01,840
other deciduous hosts we primarily see

149
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:04,560
it as a problem in oaks and maples

150
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:07,279
winter moth shares many of the same host

151
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:09,759
plant it too is a generalist in

152
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:11,839
england in northern england scotland

153
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:14,560
uh it's a problem with

154
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:17,519
sitka spruce and heather and

155
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:19,280
but mostly it feeds on deciduous plants

156
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:22,639
and you can see that i've listed apple

157
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:24,879
and blueberry as being a potential host

158
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:27,199
for winter month where did winter moth

159
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:29,439
come from at the time we did not know we

160
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:31,439
do know now thanks to the work of joe

161
00:06:29,439 --> 00:06:33,199
elkington you'll hear me mention joe

162
00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:36,959
elkinson quite a bit

163
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:39,439
uh he as far as i know is has the only

164
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:42,079
active winter month research program

165
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:44,478
going on in the uh eastern

166
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:46,879
part of north america

167
00:06:44,478 --> 00:06:48,318
right now but he has done some very

168
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:50,319
interesting work and i will pass some of

169
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:52,240
that along to you in this talk

170
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:55,919
the insect is native to europe including

171
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:59,759
england it was found in nova scotia as i

172
00:06:55,918 --> 00:07:01,359
mentioned in 1949 mostly in apples and

173
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:03,479
oaks

174
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:06,639
uh it popped up in british columbia in

175
00:07:03,478 --> 00:07:08,719
1976 you know several thousand miles

176
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:11,199
from nova scotia

177
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:13,759
and we believe it was moved there

178
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:15,598
accidentally perhaps on nursery stock or

179
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:18,160
plant material

180
00:07:15,598 --> 00:07:20,319
other finds have been in washington

181
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,479
state and oregon and these have been in

182
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:24,800
commercial blueberries in british

183
00:07:22,478 --> 00:07:27,680
columbia it's more of a

184
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:29,759
deciduous tree problem

185
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:32,400
and now it's very well established in

186
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:34,080
eastern massachusetts and most of rhode

187
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:37,279
island

188
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:39,439
it may be moved as i mentioned with

189
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:42,159
plant material when the caterpillars are

190
00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:45,598
through feeding they spin down on the

191
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:48,319
soaking web to the soil burrow in

192
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:51,439
an inch or less and pupate almost

193
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:53,520
instantly and if plants are

194
00:07:51,439 --> 00:07:56,319
dug and and bald and burnt after

195
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:59,839
containerized or moved then the insect

196
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:59,840
could very well move with it

197
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,000
winter month has probably been in

198
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:07,198
massachusetts much longer than we

199
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,279
realize uh it's it was in low numbers

200
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:10,560
i'm sure for many years it was just in

201
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:14,000
the background

202
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:16,000
uh and it is remarkably similar in a

203
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,240
number of ways to our native fall

204
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,879
cankerworm they share many of the host

205
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:23,918
plants as we've seen the adult female

206
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:25,360
moths are wingless they're similar to

207
00:08:23,918 --> 00:08:28,799
fall cankerworm and i'll show you

208
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:31,120
pictures of that in a few moments

209
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:33,278
the adult moths are active at the same

210
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:35,918
time as fall cankerworm which happens to

211
00:08:33,278 --> 00:08:37,360
be around thanksgiving time

212
00:08:35,918 --> 00:08:39,598
and winter month being a new

213
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:41,519
introduction has very limited natural

214
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:43,839
controls here in the northeast at this

215
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:43,839
time

216
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:49,278
so here's winter moth on the left and

217
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:51,920
fall cankerworm on the right

218
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:54,320
their eggs the female

219
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:57,599
winter moths

220
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:59,760
deposits her eggs rather loosely on

221
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,839
substrate usually it's

222
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:05,439
the tree trunks

223
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:07,920
and the fall cankerworm lays its eggs

224
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:11,279
in clusters these little barrel shaped

225
00:09:07,919 --> 00:09:14,639
eggs usually packed together on stems or

226
00:09:11,278 --> 00:09:17,838
tree trunks primarily

227
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:20,319
the area that's enclosed in the red line

228
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:22,880
is pretty much where we're having a

229
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:25,278
severe problem with winter moth right

230
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:25,278
now

231
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:32,479
this work and the slide looks a little

232
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:34,159
busy here but i'm just going to

233
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,519
highlight

234
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:38,799
what i think are some of the important

235
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:41,278
parts for today the magenta color

236
00:09:38,799 --> 00:09:44,000
is where winter moth has been picked up

237
00:09:41,278 --> 00:09:44,799
in in pheromone traps joe elkington's

238
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,958
lab

239
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:49,599
jeff bettner works with joe elfington

240
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:50,799
have been doing extensive survey work

241
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,480
throughout

242
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:53,359
the northeast and

243
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,039
and

244
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,560
cooperating with other

245
00:09:55,039 --> 00:09:58,319
researchers in different parts of the

246
00:09:56,559 --> 00:10:01,759
world to try to get a handle on winter

247
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:03,760
month and dna and relationships and it's

248
00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:06,480
thought now that our winter month

249
00:10:03,759 --> 00:10:08,879
population here in massachusetts is from

250
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,240
the nova scotia population its dna

251
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:12,078
matches

252
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:15,919
most closely to that

253
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:18,559
you can see in coastal nova scotia

254
00:10:15,919 --> 00:10:20,799
the magenta dots and then coming down

255
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:23,518
through maine and new hampshire and then

256
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:25,120
the cluster of it into massachusetts and

257
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:27,519
rhode island

258
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:29,679
made in new hampshire are

259
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:33,039
unaware that they have winter month

260
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:34,639
there were until uh joe up and had done

261
00:10:33,039 --> 00:10:36,480
this work and picked them up in traps

262
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:40,000
but the population levels are so low

263
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:43,120
they've never been problematic

264
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:46,240
the bottom map

265
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:47,919
has dna and genitalia

266
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:50,799
a lot of things we don't need to worry

267
00:10:47,919 --> 00:10:53,360
about too much but again the magenta

268
00:10:50,799 --> 00:10:56,078
represents the

269
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:58,959
known areas of winter moth

270
00:10:56,078 --> 00:11:02,479
and joe has been looking at

271
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:05,439
the potential for a connection between

272
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:07,920
cold hardiness and winter month

273
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:09,920
and you can see that it's coastal nova

274
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:12,078
scotia coastal maine coastal

275
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:15,120
massachusetts new hampshire

276
00:11:12,078 --> 00:11:16,078
all in that zone six

277
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:19,039
uh

278
00:11:16,078 --> 00:11:21,759
zone six a slash five b

279
00:11:19,039 --> 00:11:25,120
uh and it's quite possible

280
00:11:21,759 --> 00:11:29,039
that winter moth may never venture into

281
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:31,039
the zone five or colder and that's

282
00:11:29,039 --> 00:11:33,919
something that joe will continue to

283
00:11:31,039 --> 00:11:36,159
research to see if he can have

284
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:38,319
more of an understanding of that so it's

285
00:11:36,159 --> 00:11:41,838
possible winter month may just stay

286
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:44,399
coastal and continue to move southward

287
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:47,519
for quite a ways but maybe not westwood

288
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:47,519
northward in new england

289
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:56,879
this picture is from an organic

290
00:11:53,759 --> 00:11:59,439
apple orchard on cape cod taken several

291
00:11:56,879 --> 00:12:02,159
years ago and the defoliation you're

292
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:05,120
looking at here in early june was from

293
00:12:02,159 --> 00:12:07,439
winter moth it can be a very voracious

294
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:09,519
feeder of foliage

295
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:12,720
the life cycle of winter month it

296
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:14,959
hatches very early in the spring here in

297
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,480
eastern mass it would be approximately

298
00:12:14,958 --> 00:12:18,799
mid-april

299
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:20,639
this last year i think it was april 16th

300
00:12:18,799 --> 00:12:23,278
we saw the first hatch so somewhere

301
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:24,399
around 20 to 50 growing degree days

302
00:12:23,278 --> 00:12:25,120
roughly

303
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:26,559
or

304
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:30,159
base 50

305
00:12:26,559 --> 00:12:32,319
for that so fairly early the leaves have

306
00:12:30,159 --> 00:12:35,278
not emerged at this time what the winter

307
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:37,360
moth really wants to find

308
00:12:35,278 --> 00:12:39,919
are buds that are just beginning to

309
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:42,800
swell and they wriggle into those buds

310
00:12:39,919 --> 00:12:46,078
and and feed and they can cause great

311
00:12:42,799 --> 00:12:48,000
damage within those buds

312
00:12:46,078 --> 00:12:50,239
uh there has been some research done in

313
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:53,919
years past that shows that established

314
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:56,000
winter moth populations time their hatch

315
00:12:53,919 --> 00:12:58,000
uh with that of the phenology of the

316
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,480
plant and if they're in an oak stand

317
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,639
oaks tend to break bud later than say

318
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:05,039
maple

319
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:06,480
they may not emerge for you know a week

320
00:13:05,039 --> 00:13:10,559
10 days or more

321
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:12,800
later than they would in a maple stand

322
00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:15,838
once the buds open the larvae become

323
00:13:12,799 --> 00:13:18,319
free feeders and they can be managed

324
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:20,639
like any free feeding lepidopteran

325
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:24,079
caterpillar but if we have a lot of

326
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:27,440
caterpillars in a bud if we have a cool

327
00:13:24,078 --> 00:13:29,679
season where where bud break is delayed

328
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:32,160
then those caterpillars can create quite

329
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:36,078
a bit of damage and buds may never open

330
00:13:32,159 --> 00:13:37,679
they consume both foliar and flower buds

331
00:13:36,078 --> 00:13:40,159
and that's the problem with for the

332
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:41,759
blueberry growers is that the the larvae

333
00:13:40,159 --> 00:13:44,719
will eat the

334
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:46,720
uh reproductive parts of the flowers and

335
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:49,519
no flowers no fruit of course

336
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:52,160
uh they feed for five or six weeks and

337
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:53,919
then late may usually that last week in

338
00:13:52,159 --> 00:13:56,480
may sometimes in early june if we're

339
00:13:53,919 --> 00:13:58,479
having a cool season uh and then they

340
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:00,240
they spin down to the soil and pupate

341
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:05,039
where they stay until about thanksgiving

342
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:05,039
time and then emerge as adult malads

343
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:09,680
the eggs in the upper left corner are

344
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:13,839
scattered loosely they they're white at

345
00:14:09,679 --> 00:14:13,838
first they turn sort of a pinkish color

346
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:19,919
as the embryo matures they become a

347
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:22,240
deeper red and just before hatching they

348
00:14:19,919 --> 00:14:24,000
become this beautiful deep blue color

349
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:26,159
and you can tell if they're close to

350
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,879
hatching when they do achieve that that

351
00:14:26,159 --> 00:14:31,600
coloration the larvae hatch seek out

352
00:14:28,879 --> 00:14:34,879
swelling buds if the

353
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:38,560
buds are not swollen uh the larvae may

354
00:14:34,879 --> 00:14:40,559
spin silk and balloon to

355
00:14:38,559 --> 00:14:43,759
in their hope to land on a plant that

356
00:14:40,559 --> 00:14:46,159
does have buds in a suitable uh

357
00:14:43,759 --> 00:14:48,879
phenology for them to enter feed for

358
00:14:46,159 --> 00:14:51,360
five weeks drop to the soil and then the

359
00:14:48,879 --> 00:14:51,360
adults

360
00:14:51,759 --> 00:14:55,759
this picture was just taken a couple of

361
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:58,800
weeks ago in southeastern mass and these

362
00:14:55,759 --> 00:15:00,639
are two female winter moths and all

363
00:14:58,799 --> 00:15:02,000
those little white spots on this

364
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:04,720
structure

365
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,639
either eggs very freshly laid eggs they

366
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:09,600
will lay their eggs on anything if they

367
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:09,600
if they have to

368
00:15:10,078 --> 00:15:14,000
this is a piece of lichen

369
00:15:12,559 --> 00:15:16,479
about an inch in

370
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:19,679
length and you can see just the little

371
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,680
red eggs on there

372
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:25,199
this is a first instar winter moth

373
00:15:22,559 --> 00:15:27,518
caterpillar's dream blueberry buds that

374
00:15:25,198 --> 00:15:29,439
are just starting to swell and they

375
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:31,198
wriggle in through the bud scales to get

376
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:35,839
to the center of the plant and start

377
00:15:31,198 --> 00:15:36,799
feeding uh in 2003 deborah swanson and i

378
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:38,800
uh

379
00:15:36,799 --> 00:15:40,240
talked to joe elkinton about this and he

380
00:15:38,799 --> 00:15:42,559
deemed it important enough to go take a

381
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:43,919
look at it dominic marini who's pictured

382
00:15:42,559 --> 00:15:46,000
here in the middle

383
00:15:43,919 --> 00:15:48,240
uh was an extension specialist in

384
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:51,440
southeastern mass since retired and he

385
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:53,519
has a small farm and he was having a

386
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:55,600
terrible time mostly his blueberries we

387
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:58,480
have winter moth and here we are peeling

388
00:15:55,600 --> 00:16:00,560
buds looking for the little winter moth

389
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:04,480
as you peel the buds when they're in

390
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:04,479
this stage they are very tiny

391
00:16:04,559 --> 00:16:09,919
and this picture shows here from this

392
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,519
from a uh thank you

393
00:16:09,919 --> 00:16:13,439
from a uh

394
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:15,679
i believe this was a norway maple bud

395
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:17,600
but you can see at the bottom the head

396
00:16:15,679 --> 00:16:20,000
capsule the three pairs of legs and it's

397
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:22,720
less than a millimeter in size deborah

398
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,720
swanson refers to this as looking like a

399
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:27,199
little eyelash when you peel open that

400
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:29,680
butt in the spring and the pristine

401
00:16:27,198 --> 00:16:31,519
uh pale green tissue in there and all of

402
00:16:29,679 --> 00:16:33,599
a sudden there's these little things in

403
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:36,078
there little lines that just look like

404
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:38,959
they don't belong and usually it's a

405
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:42,399
winter moth and this is a very important

406
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:42,399
stage for monitoring

407
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,720
the larvae will chew holes in the

408
00:16:45,278 --> 00:16:51,120
foliage

409
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:52,800
and then as the bud continues to expand

410
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,919
the leaves continue to expand from the

411
00:16:52,799 --> 00:16:56,319
bud

412
00:16:53,919 --> 00:16:58,078
those holes become more exaggerated the

413
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:00,720
larvae are still there and continue to

414
00:16:58,078 --> 00:17:02,399
be free feeders and decrea create more

415
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:05,279
injury

416
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:07,759
this is a norway maple bud and you can

417
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:10,399
see uh two lottery in there that's a

418
00:17:07,759 --> 00:17:12,318
penny that's at the bottom of that bud

419
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:14,880
uh and there's they're starting to

420
00:17:12,318 --> 00:17:17,359
become free feeders

421
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:19,839
and they will completely defoliate their

422
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:19,838
host plant

423
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:26,240
this work again was done by uh joe

424
00:17:24,798 --> 00:17:29,279
elkindon

425
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:32,480
taking samples in six different towns

426
00:17:29,279 --> 00:17:34,319
the dark red line for falmouth falmouth

427
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:36,720
is on cape cod

428
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:39,678
and we really didn't start seeing winter

429
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:41,679
month out there 2005 and 2006 now it's

430
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:43,440
pretty well established

431
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:44,798
but you can see

432
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:47,440
how the numbers

433
00:17:44,798 --> 00:17:50,240
can vary but there can be upwards to you

434
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:51,759
know seven eight or nine within one butt

435
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:54,880
which of course can be

436
00:17:51,759 --> 00:17:54,879
extremely damaging

437
00:17:55,279 --> 00:17:59,879
some of the damage from winter month

438
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:05,279
the female moth emerges uh she seeks a

439
00:18:03,119 --> 00:18:07,359
vertical silhouette a tree trunk

440
00:18:05,279 --> 00:18:10,079
and she'll race toward it race up the

441
00:18:07,359 --> 00:18:11,839
tree she emits a pheromone tracks the

442
00:18:10,079 --> 00:18:14,798
nails and what you're seeing here these

443
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:16,480
clouds of male moths and this is what

444
00:18:14,798 --> 00:18:18,639
we've been experiencing in eastern

445
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:20,640
massachusetts for the past two to three

446
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:23,120
weeks now we've been getting many many

447
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:24,720
reports and it's looking like this next

448
00:18:23,119 --> 00:18:28,159
season is going to be a very heavy

449
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:30,558
winter month caterpillar season for us

450
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:32,960
the fair amount has been identified and

451
00:18:30,558 --> 00:18:36,639
synthesized and there are traps that

452
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:39,200
jonathan uses to monitor for this insect

453
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:42,400
it attracts the males

454
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:45,120
the female is at the top as she races up

455
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:47,360
the tree emitting pheromones the males

456
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:49,519
are attracted to her they mate sometimes

457
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:52,719
she's still racing up the tree dragging

458
00:18:49,519 --> 00:18:54,480
the male along with her and then when

459
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:56,960
that process is through she'll begin

460
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:59,279
laying eggs

461
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:00,880
there are a number of

462
00:18:59,279 --> 00:19:03,200
moths that are flying around

463
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:06,000
thanksgiving time and they tend to be

464
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:07,919
small and drab and they don't give us a

465
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,558
lot of characteristics

466
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:12,960
but the fall cankerworm which we started

467
00:19:10,558 --> 00:19:15,918
out talking about the male moth has a

468
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:19,519
little white patch on its wing

469
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:23,520
the winter month does not have that

470
00:19:19,519 --> 00:19:24,400
the male winter moth has a band of marks

471
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:26,400
near the

472
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:29,919
posterior end of the wings that are like

473
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:32,640
little hash marks bruce spanworm on the

474
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:35,600
right is a native insect it's in the

475
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:38,400
same genus as winter moth

476
00:19:35,599 --> 00:19:41,038
but it's native here and it really is

477
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:43,120
not problematic but we do see it i get

478
00:19:41,038 --> 00:19:46,558
these at my porch light around

479
00:19:43,119 --> 00:19:48,399
thanksgiving time they have a dark band

480
00:19:46,558 --> 00:19:50,960
that's highlighted here a little mark on

481
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:53,038
the vein that that stands out once these

482
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:54,079
moths have been active for two or three

483
00:19:53,038 --> 00:19:56,640
days

484
00:19:54,079 --> 00:19:59,279
they lose a lot of their scales and

485
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:01,600
some of this becomes very difficult to

486
00:19:59,279 --> 00:20:04,639
discern

487
00:20:01,599 --> 00:20:06,959
and i'll move on for the sake of time

488
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:09,679
winter moth females are said to be

489
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:11,600
wingless but as you can see in the uh

490
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:13,759
center picture

491
00:20:11,599 --> 00:20:15,359
uh the better picture they do have these

492
00:20:13,759 --> 00:20:17,599
very stubby

493
00:20:15,359 --> 00:20:19,038
wings where fall cankerworm is

494
00:20:17,599 --> 00:20:20,798
completely

495
00:20:19,038 --> 00:20:22,879
wingless

496
00:20:20,798 --> 00:20:26,319
here are the little

497
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:28,320
remnants of the winter moth female wings

498
00:20:26,319 --> 00:20:31,319
where fall cankerworms completely

499
00:20:28,319 --> 00:20:31,319
wingless

500
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:43,918
robert give it a second i'm not sure i i

501
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:45,679
actually have had a little challenges

502
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:48,400
here too i was trying to prepare some

503
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:50,320
poll questions for our next speaker

504
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:52,640
and i don't know what's going on so

505
00:20:50,319 --> 00:20:55,119
let's just give it a moment um we have

506
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:57,200
one question from oh okay and he's

507
00:20:55,119 --> 00:21:00,319
wondering what it what is the timing of

508
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:01,679
maple versus oak versus blueberry

509
00:21:00,319 --> 00:21:03,678
budding

510
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:05,759
and how you know it how would that

511
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:07,759
affect the um

512
00:21:05,759 --> 00:21:08,960
the amount of winter moths that might be

513
00:21:07,759 --> 00:21:12,279
out there

514
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:12,279
and the feeding

515
00:21:19,119 --> 00:21:22,719
i believe that's

516
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:25,038
something that that's not really well

517
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:28,120
understood at this time especially here

518
00:21:25,038 --> 00:21:28,119
in massachusetts

519
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:33,360
yeah i don't know if i have an answer

520
00:21:31,038 --> 00:21:33,359
for that

521
00:21:33,599 --> 00:21:40,158
and i don't specifically work with

522
00:21:35,759 --> 00:21:40,158
blueberries so i i can't say for sure

523
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:45,279
so i apologize for that

524
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:49,200
we mostly

525
00:21:45,279 --> 00:21:51,599
follow growing degree days and we um

526
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:53,038
we like to know

527
00:21:51,599 --> 00:21:55,678
before they're

528
00:21:53,038 --> 00:21:58,879
active and trying to wriggle into buds

529
00:21:55,679 --> 00:22:00,240
because that can be an important timing

530
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,919
for

531
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:03,440
managing them

532
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:06,080
especially in blueberries where it's

533
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:09,400
essential to to manage them before they

534
00:22:06,079 --> 00:22:09,399
enter the buds

535
00:22:13,038 --> 00:22:19,839
oh terrific

536
00:22:15,759 --> 00:22:22,158
uh tree banding for the adult females uh

537
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:24,480
joe elkington has had a number of years

538
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:28,159
now of study where he takes these bands

539
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:30,480
that have the the fiber batting they're

540
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:32,880
wrapped tightly around the tree and as

541
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:35,200
the female runs up the tree she

542
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:37,919
encounters this white bat and can't

543
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:39,919
crawl under it tries to go out around it

544
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:41,520
as you can see it's rather thick then

545
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:44,480
there's this film

546
00:22:41,519 --> 00:22:47,200
uh around that band that hangs under the

547
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:49,120
fiber band and it is sticky on the

548
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:50,080
inside so as the female tries to get up

549
00:22:49,119 --> 00:22:52,158
around

550
00:22:50,079 --> 00:22:54,879
the cottony band or the fibrous band she

551
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:57,200
hits the stick on the end is stuck there

552
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:59,600
so it's a great way of sampling

553
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:02,240
and there are two bands on this tree

554
00:22:59,599 --> 00:23:04,719
to see if any were able to get past the

555
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:06,558
first band okay i don't know why that's

556
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:08,880
happening let me see if i can

557
00:23:06,558 --> 00:23:10,639
for some reason i'm able to tour are you

558
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:13,360
not able to advance just let me know

559
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:13,360
what i can do

560
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,880
okay

561
00:23:17,038 --> 00:23:20,480
okay well

562
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:23,120
this is great

563
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:25,679
this is uh jeff bettner with two bands

564
00:23:23,119 --> 00:23:27,359
from one tree that i think you can

565
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:30,240
probably see

566
00:23:27,359 --> 00:23:32,000
uh are loaded with mods all right and if

567
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:34,640
you could advance the slide for me laura

568
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,159
that'd be great

569
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:38,320
i may have to have you do it it's not

570
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:40,240
responding this is just a close-up and

571
00:23:38,319 --> 00:23:42,558
if you'd advance again there are males

572
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:44,798
and females on there and at the bottom

573
00:23:42,558 --> 00:23:46,879
of this band now in the bottom left you

574
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:49,038
can see there's all this red stuff on

575
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:52,400
there and if you would advance that for

576
00:23:49,038 --> 00:23:54,960
me we'll see a close-up that even though

577
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:57,278
the females were stuck there they

578
00:23:54,960 --> 00:24:00,079
continued to just spew out eggs

579
00:23:57,278 --> 00:24:04,558
thousands and thousands of eggs

580
00:24:00,079 --> 00:24:08,240
each female produces about 150 eggs

581
00:24:04,558 --> 00:24:11,519
and those two bands that jeff is holding

582
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:12,319
both filled up within an hour

583
00:24:11,519 --> 00:24:15,440
the

584
00:24:12,319 --> 00:24:17,839
the first band filled up so much that

585
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:20,000
the new moths were able to run over the

586
00:24:17,839 --> 00:24:22,319
stuck bodies on the first band and get

587
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:25,119
up to the second band

588
00:24:22,319 --> 00:24:27,839
and if you'd advance for me

589
00:24:25,119 --> 00:24:29,359
and this is some of the work that

590
00:24:27,839 --> 00:24:31,519
joe's been doing for the past several

591
00:24:29,359 --> 00:24:33,678
years on that

592
00:24:31,519 --> 00:24:36,879
and as you can see the population since

593
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:40,640
2005 of winter months in three towns has

594
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:43,360
been going downward but then in 2008 it

595
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:45,919
started going up again there is some

596
00:24:43,359 --> 00:24:48,079
moderating factor the population size

597
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:49,919
that's not understood yet here in

598
00:24:48,079 --> 00:24:52,879
massachusetts what the

599
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:55,360
natural or environmental causes are but

600
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:58,000
right now we're expecting a banner year

601
00:24:55,359 --> 00:25:00,798
as you can see our joe's data

602
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:03,200
only goes to november 27th and there was

603
00:25:00,798 --> 00:25:05,679
some significant activity after that

604
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,679
advance

605
00:25:05,759 --> 00:25:10,158
so just some quick numbers uh

606
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:12,640
very high density

607
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:15,840
in 2004 he was getting a thousand to

608
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:19,278
1600 female moths per tree so far this

609
00:25:15,839 --> 00:25:20,158
year on uh in some towns hanson mass

610
00:25:19,278 --> 00:25:22,640
uh

611
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:23,840
he's captured 900 females in just four

612
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:26,400
days

613
00:25:23,839 --> 00:25:28,959
so we can be looking at you know 150

614
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:33,038
plus thousand eggs per tree

615
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:34,079
with these kind of population densities

616
00:25:33,038 --> 00:25:36,158
now good

617
00:25:34,079 --> 00:25:38,639
so how are we going to manage this

618
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:38,640
insect

619
00:25:39,359 --> 00:25:44,479
we're going to monitor first presence

620
00:25:41,119 --> 00:25:46,479
this is key we have to know it's there

621
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:48,079
and we need to be familiar with all of

622
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:49,919
the life stages

623
00:25:48,079 --> 00:25:51,439
laura can you advance for me it's there

624
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:54,000
we go

625
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:55,519
the moths are very obvious the eggs can

626
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,400
be difficult

627
00:25:55,519 --> 00:26:00,079
once we get into late and winter

628
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:02,000
by the time we see free feeding

629
00:26:00,079 --> 00:26:04,960
caterpillars it may be too late

630
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:07,038
especially if it's a high density year

631
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:08,640
forward

632
00:26:07,038 --> 00:26:10,720
for blueberry growers we've been

633
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:12,799
recommending a horticultural oil spray

634
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:15,278
for the overwintering eggs and some of

635
00:26:12,798 --> 00:26:16,960
the growers have been adding

636
00:26:15,278 --> 00:26:19,200
a chemical

637
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:22,000
within the spray tank and they try to

638
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:24,640
tie time their spray

639
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:26,640
just before hatch so if the oil doesn't

640
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,679
cover all of the eggs and it probably

641
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:30,320
won't

642
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:32,720
that the uh caterpillars that are

643
00:26:30,319 --> 00:26:33,918
successful in hatching from eggs

644
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:36,880
the uh

645
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:40,000
chemical companion which might be a

646
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:42,159
organic in organophosphate or

647
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,880
pyrethroid whatever is labeled for

648
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:48,240
blueberries and and mixes with oil

649
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:48,240
perhaps even spinosad

650
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:53,519
bt works but

651
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:56,159
it will not work when the larvae are

652
00:26:53,519 --> 00:26:59,200
inside of the bud and that's uh where a

653
00:26:56,159 --> 00:27:01,120
lot of damage can occur sometimes

654
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:04,240
uh significant damage

655
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:06,719
spinosa products uh for trees and shrubs

656
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:08,319
it's conserved which is the commercial

657
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:12,558
version there are a number of homeowner

658
00:27:08,319 --> 00:27:15,839
versions and trust is an organic version

659
00:27:12,558 --> 00:27:19,200
or a label for spinosad products and it

660
00:27:15,839 --> 00:27:20,398
works remarkably well on all

661
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:22,720
caterpillars

662
00:27:20,398 --> 00:27:24,879
but they have to be free feeders

663
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:27,278
tebufenazide is confirmed i don't

664
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:30,080
believe it has labeling for blueberries

665
00:27:27,278 --> 00:27:32,558
it's a growth regulator

666
00:27:30,079 --> 00:27:34,558
primarily for lepidoptera then

667
00:27:32,558 --> 00:27:37,599
chemical insecticides

668
00:27:34,558 --> 00:27:39,440
such as the pyrethroids but again

669
00:27:37,599 --> 00:27:40,879
once they're free feeders and hopefully

670
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:43,600
it's not too late

671
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:45,360
and the primary

672
00:27:43,599 --> 00:27:48,398
factor that's being looked at are

673
00:27:45,359 --> 00:27:50,398
parasitoids nova scotia had remarkable

674
00:27:48,398 --> 00:27:53,359
success with using these these

675
00:27:50,398 --> 00:27:53,359
parasitoids

676
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:57,759
and they are now the controlling factor

677
00:27:55,440 --> 00:28:00,960
of winter moth in nova scotia winter

678
00:27:57,759 --> 00:28:02,720
month is hard to find in nova scotia

679
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:05,278
laura i need for you to advance for me

680
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:07,839
thank you cyzeno's albicans is a to

681
00:28:05,278 --> 00:28:08,720
kenit fly it's a specialist it's only

682
00:28:07,839 --> 00:28:12,158
known

683
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:14,319
uh host is winter moth agrippon

684
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:17,440
is an ipneumanid wasp and it's a

685
00:28:14,319 --> 00:28:20,398
generalist and it may be here already

686
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:23,759
we're not sure but all the work here is

687
00:28:20,398 --> 00:28:27,918
being done with cyzinus

688
00:28:23,759 --> 00:28:29,038
can you advance thank you and once more

689
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:31,360
thank you

690
00:28:29,038 --> 00:28:33,440
uh from nova scotia again i got this

691
00:28:31,359 --> 00:28:35,359
slide from joe elkington you can see

692
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:37,759
that in 54

693
00:28:35,359 --> 00:28:39,278
they started releases of both of these

694
00:28:37,759 --> 00:28:42,720
parasitoids

695
00:28:39,278 --> 00:28:45,359
and that and once they got into 1962 and

696
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:46,960
63 winter moth populations were

697
00:28:45,359 --> 00:28:49,839
extremely low

698
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:52,720
and uh the controlling factor again is

699
00:28:49,839 --> 00:28:53,359
this fly they mass reared and released

700
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:57,038
it

701
00:28:53,359 --> 00:29:00,959
uh over eight or ten years and uh got

702
00:28:57,038 --> 00:29:00,960
very good successes with it

703
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:07,600
the fly

704
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:11,519
seeks out

705
00:29:07,599 --> 00:29:12,719
winter moth caterpillars and it know it

706
00:29:11,519 --> 00:29:15,200
using the

707
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:16,640
olfactory cues it picks up on where

708
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:19,278
winter moth is feeding well i can

709
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:20,799
advance for me and it lays its eggs on

710
00:29:19,278 --> 00:29:24,720
the foliage this is

711
00:29:20,798 --> 00:29:24,720
these are three eggs highly magnified

712
00:29:24,839 --> 00:29:29,918
advanced once more

713
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:33,599
once more

714
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:36,320
thank you that tiny dot is an egg of the

715
00:29:33,599 --> 00:29:39,119
sizinus and as the winter month

716
00:29:36,319 --> 00:29:40,480
caterpillar feeds it ingests the egg

717
00:29:39,119 --> 00:29:43,359
once the egg is in the gut of the

718
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:45,599
caterpillar it will hatch and then the

719
00:29:43,359 --> 00:29:48,158
fly maggot

720
00:29:45,599 --> 00:29:50,000
continues to consume and kill the winter

721
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:51,919
month caterpillar

722
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:54,398
advance

723
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:58,559
and these are six sites now

724
00:29:54,398 --> 00:30:00,479
where joe elpinton has released sizinus

725
00:29:58,558 --> 00:30:03,038
and he has uh

726
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:05,519
been able to retrieve some in following

727
00:30:03,038 --> 00:30:07,759
years very low numbers so far

728
00:30:05,519 --> 00:30:11,359
but his goal is to continue mass rearing

729
00:30:07,759 --> 00:30:13,359
these and to continue releasing them um

730
00:30:11,359 --> 00:30:15,519
i have a bit more to go but i'm

731
00:30:13,359 --> 00:30:17,038
concerned about time i think we'll be

732
00:30:15,519 --> 00:30:19,679
okay i don't want to cut into roger's

733
00:30:17,038 --> 00:30:19,679
time okay

734
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:23,919
yeah

735
00:30:22,558 --> 00:30:26,240
i will

736
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:28,080
okay if you'd advance for me just just

737
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:29,519
tell me when i'm finished

738
00:30:28,079 --> 00:30:30,639
thank you

739
00:30:29,519 --> 00:30:32,558
so

740
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:34,799
you i've covered this so you may

741
00:30:32,558 --> 00:30:36,398
continue

742
00:30:34,798 --> 00:30:38,720
oh i'm done

743
00:30:36,398 --> 00:30:41,519
i'm sorry laura uh

744
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:44,720
this is our website at umass green info

745
00:30:41,519 --> 00:30:48,960
it is on the uh the handout that is

746
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:51,038
posted here at this website um

747
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:52,798
and uh if you want to read more about

748
00:30:51,038 --> 00:30:55,359
winter month and all right learn some

749
00:30:52,798 --> 00:30:55,359
resources

750
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:58,399
um

751
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:04,720
you could talk to um

752
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:07,200
carl depol is wondering about certified

753
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:08,558
wildlife habitats and he's interested in

754
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:10,558
growing various types of berries to

755
00:31:08,558 --> 00:31:14,319
promote wildlife habitat

756
00:31:10,558 --> 00:31:16,720
uh this that question perhaps carl we

757
00:31:14,319 --> 00:31:18,639
can hold for a second but maybe your

758
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:20,079
next question um at this time of the

759
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:22,320
year i noticed that blueberries are

760
00:31:20,079 --> 00:31:24,639
coming from chile and argentina

761
00:31:22,319 --> 00:31:27,359
what sorts of pest concerns do they have

762
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:28,480
in the southern hemisphere i don't know

763
00:31:27,359 --> 00:31:31,199
if you

764
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:33,839
have a comment about that bob

765
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,840
um

766
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:45,200
well i don't you know as i

767
00:31:42,319 --> 00:31:47,038
i stated at the beginning i i don't work

768
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:49,440
with blueberries eh

769
00:31:47,038 --> 00:31:50,960
um

770
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:52,558
incidentally you know i wanted to

771
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:54,240
working with some of the blueberry

772
00:31:52,558 --> 00:31:55,759
growers trying to help them with this

773
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:57,120
winter month but

774
00:31:55,759 --> 00:32:01,038
i

775
00:31:57,119 --> 00:32:01,038
virtually all of my work with her i

776
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:13,278
yeah

777
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:15,840
i know uh

778
00:32:13,278 --> 00:32:17,200
i'm not sure if sonya shlomon is still

779
00:32:15,839 --> 00:32:20,079
yeah

780
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:20,080
she was earlier

781
00:32:21,599 --> 00:32:26,319
turn on your microphone for you but just

782
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:28,079
give me a little check mark or something

783
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:29,918
if you'd like to comment

784
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:32,480
through the audio otherwise if you could

785
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:34,880
type something in we do have a couple of

786
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:37,120
other questions is anyone looking for

787
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:38,880
the winter moth in the lakes regions of

788
00:32:37,119 --> 00:32:41,199
new york state

789
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:43,360
do you or even in eastern new york which

790
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:45,840
i'm somewhat concerned about i have not

791
00:32:43,359 --> 00:32:47,439
been looking for it but do you know bob

792
00:32:45,839 --> 00:32:50,000
if there's any

793
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:53,240
larger regional scouting going on for

794
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,240
this past

795
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:04,320
well i know that the pheromone trapping

796
00:33:02,079 --> 00:33:06,720
was pretty widespread

797
00:33:04,319 --> 00:33:10,558
uh but i think it was mostly done in

798
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:12,720
areas where it was suspected and and

799
00:33:10,558 --> 00:33:14,480
also where it's established you know in

800
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:15,919
other parts of the world

801
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:19,200
uh i

802
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:20,240
it was picked up uh in two sites in long

803
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:22,558
island

804
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:23,599
for the past couple of years but

805
00:33:22,558 --> 00:33:25,599
uh

806
00:33:23,599 --> 00:33:27,759
you know the extension people there were

807
00:33:25,599 --> 00:33:29,759
completely unaware that they had winter

808
00:33:27,759 --> 00:33:31,599
moth and still if it wasn't for the

809
00:33:29,759 --> 00:33:34,000
trapping they wouldn't know it

810
00:33:31,599 --> 00:33:36,398
uh it's in very very long time

811
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:38,159
eddie has a question if females so no i

812
00:33:36,398 --> 00:33:40,398
don't know if anything is being done in

813
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:44,760
the world used in late november to help

814
00:33:40,398 --> 00:33:44,759
control or reduce the population

815
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,919
they

816
00:33:53,278 --> 00:33:57,200
emerge over uh

817
00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:58,720
a fairly

818
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,840
lengthy time

819
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:02,319
um

820
00:33:59,839 --> 00:34:04,639
it starts it can start about the fir the

821
00:34:02,319 --> 00:34:08,078
week before thanksgiving

822
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:09,280
uh and it can go into january

823
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:11,599
and

824
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:14,240
i guess it's possible that you could

825
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:17,519
spray pyrethroads at that time

826
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:18,799
uh or you know a knock down type spray

827
00:34:17,519 --> 00:34:21,280
the weather

828
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:24,000
you know we have freezing nights uh and

829
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:25,200
i don't know how conducive it would be

830
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,358
to

831
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:30,000
those conditions are for using uh

832
00:34:27,358 --> 00:34:32,878
products like that at that time also

833
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:35,599
it depends on where you're

834
00:34:32,878 --> 00:34:37,039
what surrounds your blueberry fields and

835
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:39,200
if you have

836
00:34:37,039 --> 00:34:42,239
forested areas

837
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:44,799
especially if you have maples or oaks

838
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:47,118
you may be successful at treating what

839
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:50,480
is on your blueberry but

840
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:51,358
uh you may have blow in ballooning drop

841
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:54,079
down

842
00:34:51,358 --> 00:34:55,519
uh from the surrounding trees once they

843
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:58,640
hatch out

844
00:34:55,519 --> 00:35:01,440
uh so it's it's it's a very frustrating

845
00:34:58,639 --> 00:35:03,199
past i was talking a lot to the blue

846
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:05,119
excuse me to the blueberry growers in

847
00:35:03,199 --> 00:35:07,679
southeastern mass for

848
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:10,720
uh two or three years when this was so

849
00:35:07,679 --> 00:35:13,440
problematic and the bottom line is that

850
00:35:10,719 --> 00:35:14,879
it's very frustrating you have to be on

851
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:16,960
it daily

852
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:19,760
uh especially when they're they're

853
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:21,679
hatching and are about to hatch and just

854
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:23,520
stay after it monitor the bud see if

855
00:35:21,679 --> 00:35:25,519
they're getting into the buds

856
00:35:23,519 --> 00:35:26,559
uh because that is really the crucial

857
00:35:25,519 --> 00:35:29,039
time

858
00:35:26,559 --> 00:35:30,799
once the buds open you know if we don't

859
00:35:29,039 --> 00:35:32,960
have a big problem

860
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:35,039
uh but once the buds open

861
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:37,280
we can treat them like we would any

862
00:35:35,039 --> 00:35:39,279
other lipid after caterpillar and it's

863
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:41,359
quite easy to manage there's one other

864
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:45,839
question from jeff miller what is the

865
00:35:41,358 --> 00:35:45,838
timing for the release of predators

866
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:55,599
uh well it's actually a parasitoid and

867
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:58,560
it's released

868
00:35:55,599 --> 00:36:00,079
a week or so before

869
00:35:58,559 --> 00:36:02,320
the uh

870
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:05,119
the winter month caterpillar is going to

871
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:07,599
finish feeding and drop to pupate so

872
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:09,760
fairly mature caterpillars and if it

873
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:12,000
here it would be

874
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:14,320
uh about the third week i should have

875
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,079
said um

876
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:18,480
the other question from carl is there

877
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:23,079
are there bird species or any other

878
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:23,079
natural predator that feed on the winter

879
00:36:27,199 --> 00:36:30,799
we do see uh

880
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:33,358
different birds in

881
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:35,680
in trees or bushes picking away at

882
00:36:33,358 --> 00:36:37,279
winter moth but it's once the foliage

883
00:36:35,679 --> 00:36:38,879
has opened and

884
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:41,200
and uh

885
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:42,880
they're obvious and free feeders

886
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:45,279
but it doesn't seem to make a big

887
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:46,559
difference the population numbers become

888
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:49,040
excessive

889
00:36:46,559 --> 00:36:51,519
and very very damaging one of the points

890
00:36:49,039 --> 00:36:54,079
i wanted to make is that we have

891
00:36:51,519 --> 00:36:56,159
had consecutive years of winter months

892
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:59,119
in southeastern mass

893
00:36:56,159 --> 00:37:01,279
on the oaks and the maples primarily and

894
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:03,358
we have just thousands and thousands of

895
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:04,640
dead trees now the trees were so weak

896
00:37:03,358 --> 00:37:07,039
and that they succumbed to other

897
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:09,679
secondary factors and they've become a

898
00:37:07,039 --> 00:37:12,639
huge liability for the utility companies

899
00:37:09,679 --> 00:37:15,039
and these dead trees threaten the the

900
00:37:12,639 --> 00:37:16,799
power lines yeah i can attest to that

901
00:37:15,039 --> 00:37:18,639
having been in and it's been pretty

902
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:20,720
serious in that regard

903
00:37:18,639 --> 00:37:23,279
and over the summer it really is quite

904
00:37:20,719 --> 00:37:25,279
quite amazing i'm going to cut off

905
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:29,359
questions now we might be able to get to

906
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:32,240
some of them after dr williams

907
00:37:29,358 --> 00:37:35,119
presentation uh bob childs thank you so

908
00:37:32,239 --> 00:37:38,319
much for telling us about this pest

909
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:40,400
and now i'd like to introduce our next

910
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:42,640
speaker and i want to apologize to all

911
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:43,838
of you dr williams had some poll

912
00:37:42,639 --> 00:37:46,799
questions

913
00:37:43,838 --> 00:37:50,239
for us but for some reason the polls are

914
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:52,160
not working today the pods won't open up

915
00:37:50,239 --> 00:37:53,838
properly for me so we're going to have

916
00:37:52,159 --> 00:37:56,799
to bypass that

917
00:37:53,838 --> 00:37:59,279
and i'd like to introduce dr roger

918
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:02,320
williams who is from the ohio state

919
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:04,400
university his focus of his research is

920
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:06,559
to develop better insect management

921
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:09,200
practices for the small fruit growers in

922
00:38:06,559 --> 00:38:11,679
ohio and he's been involved in

923
00:38:09,199 --> 00:38:14,639
developing ipm techniques through the

924
00:38:11,679 --> 00:38:17,919
employment of bio-rationals attract

925
00:38:14,639 --> 00:38:19,759
attractants and bio-control measures

926
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:22,159
presently he's studying the efficacy of

927
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:23,839
various nematodes to control grape root

928
00:38:22,159 --> 00:38:25,598
borer

929
00:38:23,838 --> 00:38:27,519
and also investigating the use of

930
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:29,680
parasitic nematodes in the management of

931
00:38:27,519 --> 00:38:32,159
the raspberry crown borer

932
00:38:29,679 --> 00:38:34,719
but today he's going to be talking to us

933
00:38:32,159 --> 00:38:37,279
about managing japanese beetles and

934
00:38:34,719 --> 00:38:38,559
different strategies for that pest which

935
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:41,359
is um

936
00:38:38,559 --> 00:38:43,440
a serious pest and dr williams i do want

937
00:38:41,358 --> 00:38:46,078
to let you know that you have the full

938
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:47,599
half hour don't worry about the time we

939
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:49,200
don't get cut off

940
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:50,880
and then we can have a little bit of

941
00:38:49,199 --> 00:38:51,598
question and answer at the end of that

942
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:55,960
so

943
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:55,960
thank you very much for joining us

944
00:39:00,239 --> 00:39:03,598
okay well thank you and uh welcome to

945
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:06,000
everyone

946
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:07,920
uh here in ohio we've kind of missed the

947
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,280
storm so far but it's hidden this way it

948
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:11,760
looks like

949
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:13,200
so uh right now we're our roads are

950
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:16,320
pretty good

951
00:39:13,199 --> 00:39:17,519
uh i'm the small fruit entomologist from

952
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:19,039
here in

953
00:39:17,519 --> 00:39:21,280
northern ohio

954
00:39:19,039 --> 00:39:23,279
connected with ohio state university we

955
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:26,000
call it oardc

956
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:31,040
and uh work primarily with grapes

957
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:33,599
blueberries brambles and strawberries

958
00:39:31,039 --> 00:39:35,920
excuse me as you will see on the slides

959
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:39,039
we do have very serious problems with

960
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:40,960
japanese beetles in ohio and also in the

961
00:39:39,039 --> 00:39:43,440
neighboring states

962
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:45,039
it's one of the most problematic pests

963
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:47,358
that we will see

964
00:39:45,039 --> 00:39:50,320
and one of the reasons is that it

965
00:39:47,358 --> 00:39:53,679
attacks so many different crops

966
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:55,519
uh and another reason probably is that

967
00:39:53,679 --> 00:39:56,879
so many people know what the japanese

968
00:39:55,519 --> 00:39:58,480
beetle is

969
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:01,440
because they've seen it in their yards

970
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:04,719
eating on a lot of different plants

971
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:07,920
i also work with the japanese beetle

972
00:40:04,719 --> 00:40:11,519
problem that we have in the azores

973
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:13,760
and that is uh been going on for

974
00:40:11,519 --> 00:40:16,318
since the 70s

975
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:19,280
uh and it originally came in there at

976
00:40:16,318 --> 00:40:21,838
the u.s air force base

977
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:24,400
and uh

978
00:40:21,838 --> 00:40:25,599
that we have in the azores on terceta

979
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:28,160
island

980
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:30,079
so we're pretty sure that we're the

981
00:40:28,159 --> 00:40:32,239
guilty ones of bringing it in there on

982
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:36,720
some of our jet planes

983
00:40:32,239 --> 00:40:38,799
and now it's all over the the azores

984
00:40:36,719 --> 00:40:41,759
on the nine different islands and the

985
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:42,720
azores are about uh three-quarters of

986
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:47,520
the way

987
00:40:42,719 --> 00:40:51,039
over from between new jersey and lisbon

988
00:40:47,519 --> 00:40:52,880
uh can you get yours to it advance is

989
00:40:51,039 --> 00:40:55,679
slide set advancing

990
00:40:52,880 --> 00:41:00,079
oh i gotta do this

991
00:40:55,679 --> 00:41:00,078
the yes there oh i don't want it

992
00:41:02,559 --> 00:41:07,920
that's what i'm looking for yeah wait a

993
00:41:04,838 --> 00:41:08,960
minute yep it's working

994
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:11,519
uh

995
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:13,679
as most of you know the the japanese

996
00:41:11,519 --> 00:41:15,480
beetle arrived here in the u.s

997
00:41:13,679 --> 00:41:19,039
sometime between

998
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:22,318
1910 and 1916 it was first

999
00:41:19,039 --> 00:41:24,079
really discovered in 1916 i guess in

1000
00:41:22,318 --> 00:41:26,400
southern new jersey

1001
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:28,400
and thus the first japanese beetle

1002
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:29,838
laboratory was established there in new

1003
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:33,519
jersey

1004
00:41:29,838 --> 00:41:34,639
uh as the japanese beetle moved west

1005
00:41:33,519 --> 00:41:37,759
the

1006
00:41:34,639 --> 00:41:39,679
usda japanese beetle lab moved here to

1007
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:43,119
worcester ohio

1008
00:41:39,679 --> 00:41:44,960
and uh so it's still mostly here they'd

1009
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:46,400
go by a different name but still there's

1010
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:48,400
several people here that work with

1011
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:50,639
japanese beetles

1012
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:50,639
uh

1013
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:53,280
it

1014
00:41:53,519 --> 00:41:59,599
is still on the move and it's moved

1015
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:01,119
north up into michigan over the last few

1016
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:03,519
years

1017
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:05,440
it is a terrible pest of blueberries and

1018
00:42:03,519 --> 00:42:08,559
other small fruits in ohio and

1019
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:08,559
surrounding states

1020
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:14,880
uh

1021
00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:17,599
michigan leads the nation in production

1022
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:18,640
of high blood bush blueberries

1023
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:21,039
uh

1024
00:42:18,639 --> 00:42:23,920
i'm not sure that this the most recent

1025
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:26,559
data but because i know georgia has

1026
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:28,960
planted an awful lot of blueberries with

1027
00:42:26,559 --> 00:42:31,838
the help of michigan companies and

1028
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:34,480
growers but at the time this was

1029
00:42:31,838 --> 00:42:37,358
published they had about 40 percent of

1030
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:37,358
the u.s crop

1031
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:42,319
however

1032
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:44,800
uh financial uh security of the michigan

1033
00:42:42,318 --> 00:42:47,119
berry industry was threatened

1034
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:49,599
by the recent invasion of the japanese

1035
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:52,160
beetle which happened something like 10

1036
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:54,480
or 12 years ago

1037
00:42:52,159 --> 00:42:56,719
and

1038
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:58,480
it's now into the major centers where

1039
00:42:56,719 --> 00:43:02,480
the commercial blueberries are raised

1040
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:04,318
there in michigan uh not too far off of

1041
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:06,318
lake michigan there

1042
00:43:04,318 --> 00:43:07,519
on that side

1043
00:43:06,318 --> 00:43:10,559
and the

1044
00:43:07,519 --> 00:43:13,679
they produce a lot of fresh fruit and

1045
00:43:10,559 --> 00:43:16,000
some of its uh even exported and so

1046
00:43:13,679 --> 00:43:17,358
forth they've tried uh

1047
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,920
a lot of different things on the

1048
00:43:17,358 --> 00:43:23,119
japanese beetles to keep them down but

1049
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:26,480
have trouble with residue so they they

1050
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:28,000
keep working on on better systems to do

1051
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:29,679
that

1052
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:32,159
uh

1053
00:43:29,679 --> 00:43:35,279
much of the michigan crop

1054
00:43:32,159 --> 00:43:39,279
is harvested mechanically

1055
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:40,720
and this has led to some unique problems

1056
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:42,839
uh

1057
00:43:40,719 --> 00:43:45,199
one of them is that it's of course

1058
00:43:42,838 --> 00:43:48,880
skeletonizes the leaves like it does on

1059
00:43:45,199 --> 00:43:49,679
grapes and other many other things

1060
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:52,480
and

1061
00:43:49,679 --> 00:43:55,039
makes the fruit unsaleable where it

1062
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:57,519
bites off the skin and leaves the fruit

1063
00:43:55,039 --> 00:44:00,159
white fruit exposed there

1064
00:43:57,519 --> 00:44:02,880
another problem is and this is one that

1065
00:44:00,159 --> 00:44:05,598
i had hard time believing was that

1066
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:07,119
japanese beetles were getting inside of

1067
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:08,880
the berries

1068
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:10,480
and they couldn't be found on the

1069
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:13,358
conveyor belts

1070
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:15,440
so they did everything from changing the

1071
00:44:13,358 --> 00:44:17,279
color of the conveyor belts to changing

1072
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:20,240
the lights overhead

1073
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:21,920
and still they had difficulties with

1074
00:44:20,239 --> 00:44:23,358
that

1075
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:25,519
process

1076
00:44:23,358 --> 00:44:27,838
but

1077
00:44:25,519 --> 00:44:30,318
why do the berries go inside the beetles

1078
00:44:27,838 --> 00:44:31,920
the inside of the berries

1079
00:44:30,318 --> 00:44:33,838
nobody

1080
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:37,119
seems to

1081
00:44:33,838 --> 00:44:39,039
know that here in ohio because we don't

1082
00:44:37,119 --> 00:44:40,800
mechanically harvest

1083
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:43,039
so that's why i kind of doubted it when

1084
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:45,760
i first heard it but then i was invited

1085
00:44:43,039 --> 00:44:49,358
over to to really see it at one of the

1086
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:49,359
processing companies nearby

1087
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:55,838
and what happens is that the

1088
00:44:53,199 --> 00:44:59,039
the berries are mechanically harvested

1089
00:44:55,838 --> 00:45:01,519
and then immediately taken into the cold

1090
00:44:59,039 --> 00:45:02,800
storage room well when they're harvested

1091
00:45:01,519 --> 00:45:05,119
of course that knocks down a lot of

1092
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:06,720
japanese beetles with the

1093
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:09,039
with the blueberries

1094
00:45:06,719 --> 00:45:10,959
and so evidently what happens they're

1095
00:45:09,039 --> 00:45:14,400
looking for a warmer home

1096
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:16,400
and they uh dig their way inside of the

1097
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:19,400
berries themselves and conceal

1098
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:19,400
themselves

1099
00:45:21,039 --> 00:45:28,239
the adults feed on the foliage fruit and

1100
00:45:23,519 --> 00:45:30,880
flowers of more than 300 kinds of plants

1101
00:45:28,239 --> 00:45:33,598
but blueberries and grapes are two of

1102
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:36,318
their preferred hosts

1103
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:38,559
the larvae are c-shaped grubs in the

1104
00:45:36,318 --> 00:45:41,199
soil and do serious

1105
00:45:38,559 --> 00:45:44,239
damage especially to grasses

1106
00:45:41,199 --> 00:45:45,519
and their distinguishing characters of

1107
00:45:44,239 --> 00:45:48,000
the grubs

1108
00:45:45,519 --> 00:45:50,559
are course the rastal pattern

1109
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:51,679
which is right under the the underside

1110
00:45:50,559 --> 00:45:53,920
of the tip

1111
00:45:51,679 --> 00:45:57,199
and on japanese beetles it's shaped like

1112
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:59,039
a v it's pretty easy to distinguish from

1113
00:45:57,199 --> 00:46:01,358
most others

1114
00:45:59,039 --> 00:46:03,679
and then the adult beetle of course is

1115
00:46:01,358 --> 00:46:04,559
metallic green

1116
00:46:03,679 --> 00:46:06,879
and

1117
00:46:04,559 --> 00:46:09,039
coppery brown wing covers

1118
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:10,800
tufts of white hair along the edge of

1119
00:46:09,039 --> 00:46:14,079
the sides of the body

1120
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:15,440
the adults are about a half an inch long

1121
00:46:14,079 --> 00:46:16,800
but after you haven't worked with them

1122
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:18,559
for a while you start thinking they're

1123
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:20,640
larger and larger because they're so

1124
00:46:18,559 --> 00:46:23,599
much of a

1125
00:46:20,639 --> 00:46:23,598
problem to our

1126
00:46:25,719 --> 00:46:31,439
growers uh

1127
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:34,720
the uh larvae feed principally on

1128
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:37,679
grassroots as i mentioned before

1129
00:46:34,719 --> 00:46:39,519
and they show up the adults show up

1130
00:46:37,679 --> 00:46:42,159
around the same time that we start

1131
00:46:39,519 --> 00:46:45,358
seeing ripe blueberries here in northern

1132
00:46:42,159 --> 00:46:46,399
ohio and that's around the 4th of july

1133
00:46:45,358 --> 00:46:48,880
so

1134
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:50,480
at that time when the females emerge

1135
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:53,440
from the soil

1136
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:53,440
the eggs

1137
00:46:54,318 --> 00:46:59,039
they mate uh very close to that time

1138
00:46:56,960 --> 00:47:00,559
because the males are so strongly

1139
00:46:59,039 --> 00:47:03,119
attracted to them

1140
00:47:00,559 --> 00:47:06,000
that you'll see just

1141
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:09,119
a lot of activity on the ground as the

1142
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:10,960
females the virgin females come up

1143
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:13,680
and uh

1144
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:17,599
so that uh makes it for interesting

1145
00:47:13,679 --> 00:47:19,679
behavior of them and uh

1146
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:21,760
then at the winter time they go down

1147
00:47:19,679 --> 00:47:23,919
from three to twelve inches

1148
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:26,559
and the soil the larvae do and come up

1149
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:28,639
in the the following spring

1150
00:47:26,559 --> 00:47:32,319
there is but one generation a year here

1151
00:47:28,639 --> 00:47:34,879
in northern ohio however in some colder

1152
00:47:32,318 --> 00:47:37,440
areas come different states it takes two

1153
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:39,280
years to complete the life cycle further

1154
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:41,920
north and where it's a lot colder than

1155
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:41,920
it is here

1156
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:51,039
the

1157
00:47:48,079 --> 00:47:53,039
beetles prefer foliage exposed to direct

1158
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:56,079
sunlight and often

1159
00:47:53,039 --> 00:47:59,599
are seen clustered together feeding on

1160
00:47:56,079 --> 00:48:01,760
tinder vegetative part damaged leaves

1161
00:47:59,599 --> 00:48:03,920
have a laced appearance and severely

1162
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:05,040
affected leaves will drop off this is

1163
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:08,400
the same

1164
00:48:05,039 --> 00:48:11,599
for blueberries or for for grapes that

1165
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:11,599
we work with a lot

1166
00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:14,318
uh

1167
00:48:14,639 --> 00:48:19,598
let's see here in

1168
00:48:17,039 --> 00:48:20,480
southern ontario and northern new

1169
00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:22,880
england

1170
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:26,719
and adirondacks

1171
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:30,480
of western regions of new york

1172
00:48:26,719 --> 00:48:32,558
are that are unusually cold

1173
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:34,960
and also in southern new england

1174
00:48:32,559 --> 00:48:37,359
portions it takes two years to complete

1175
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:39,358
the life cycle

1176
00:48:37,358 --> 00:48:41,440
maybe that would be useful here too if

1177
00:48:39,358 --> 00:48:42,480
we could maybe get rid of them for one

1178
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:46,400
year

1179
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:49,280
but the last three years we have seen

1180
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:51,039
a lot of japanese beetle especially

1181
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:54,079
right here at worcester because we've

1182
00:48:51,039 --> 00:48:57,440
had just about the right amount of rain

1183
00:48:54,079 --> 00:49:00,000
and uh so forth so it's it's really

1184
00:48:57,440 --> 00:49:02,318
been a hectic time for us and we've seen

1185
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,920
a lot now this varies from area to area

1186
00:49:02,318 --> 00:49:04,639
of course

1187
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:08,240
but

1188
00:49:04,639 --> 00:49:10,558
the last two years prior to 09 were

1189
00:49:08,239 --> 00:49:13,759
really bad

1190
00:49:10,559 --> 00:49:16,480
as you go further south then you get

1191
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:20,960
earlier emergence as you would expect

1192
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:23,440
and uh in southern georgia they and

1193
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:24,720
they may come out in in early

1194
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:27,039
in may

1195
00:49:24,719 --> 00:49:29,598
and mid-june

1196
00:49:27,039 --> 00:49:31,358
north carolina and kentucky

1197
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:32,559
but

1198
00:49:31,358 --> 00:49:35,039
until

1199
00:49:32,559 --> 00:49:38,640
july and eastern massachusetts and in

1200
00:49:35,039 --> 00:49:41,920
ohio in this area this far north

1201
00:49:38,639 --> 00:49:45,279
males began to emerge a few days

1202
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:47,599
earlier than females and the sex ratio

1203
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:50,319
of adults emerging in the field is about

1204
00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:50,318
one to one

1205
00:49:55,519 --> 00:49:59,920
to control the japanese beetles and

1206
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:02,239
fruit

1207
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:05,519
other fruit insects

1208
00:50:02,239 --> 00:50:08,159
i recommend that you go to your local

1209
00:50:05,519 --> 00:50:08,159
extension

1210
00:50:08,239 --> 00:50:13,679
publications because some things are

1211
00:50:10,639 --> 00:50:16,159
legal in some places and not another so

1212
00:50:13,679 --> 00:50:18,799
for example ohio and new york

1213
00:50:16,159 --> 00:50:22,879
have pretty different regulations due to

1214
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:22,880
their restrictions that they have there

1215
00:50:24,159 --> 00:50:27,358
okay

1216
00:50:25,358 --> 00:50:30,960
uh

1217
00:50:27,358 --> 00:50:32,558
despite the uh concerns of the federal

1218
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:35,760
and states

1219
00:50:32,559 --> 00:50:37,119
uh to eradicate it

1220
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:40,480
uh

1221
00:50:37,119 --> 00:50:42,240
then to limit it it spread it spread

1222
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:44,800
the jb

1223
00:50:42,239 --> 00:50:48,159
progress progressively extended its

1224
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:51,119
range and now it is in most of

1225
00:50:48,159 --> 00:50:53,519
widespread and destructive insect pests

1226
00:50:51,119 --> 00:50:56,559
of turf and landscape

1227
00:50:53,519 --> 00:50:59,838
plants in the eastern united states

1228
00:50:56,559 --> 00:51:01,920
more than 460 million dollars is

1229
00:50:59,838 --> 00:51:04,719
expended each year

1230
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:07,920
for direct control cost and for

1231
00:51:04,719 --> 00:51:10,318
renovating or replacing damaged turf and

1232
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:13,039
ornamental plants

1233
00:51:10,318 --> 00:51:15,920
japanese beetles also damage fruit crops

1234
00:51:13,039 --> 00:51:17,838
soybeans maize and other gardens

1235
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:20,159
and field crops

1236
00:51:17,838 --> 00:51:23,119
larvae and adults are targets for a

1237
00:51:20,159 --> 00:51:26,399
substantial insecticide usage especially

1238
00:51:23,119 --> 00:51:29,119
on home lawns golf courses and urban

1239
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:29,119
landscapes

1240
00:51:33,358 --> 00:51:40,318
and the

1241
00:51:36,639 --> 00:51:43,440
i think i'll switch to the next one here

1242
00:51:40,318 --> 00:51:46,800
some research that we've done uh

1243
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:49,440
here and and the surrounding states

1244
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:52,240
we picked this uh information up and i

1245
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:55,358
think most of this is in our

1246
00:51:52,239 --> 00:51:58,000
uh air label book for

1247
00:51:55,358 --> 00:52:00,318
the midwest commercial

1248
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:03,519
small fruit and grape

1249
00:52:00,318 --> 00:52:06,719
spray guide 2009

1250
00:52:03,519 --> 00:52:07,599
and it'll soon be out the 2010 version

1251
00:52:06,719 --> 00:52:10,159
but

1252
00:52:07,599 --> 00:52:13,359
if you wanted to know more on the

1253
00:52:10,159 --> 00:52:15,679
pesticides for blueberries you could go

1254
00:52:13,358 --> 00:52:19,519
to that on the website this midwest

1255
00:52:15,679 --> 00:52:22,399
commercial small fruit and grape

1256
00:52:19,519 --> 00:52:22,400
spray guide

1257
00:52:23,039 --> 00:52:27,119
the most common one here

1258
00:52:26,159 --> 00:52:28,480
is

1259
00:52:27,119 --> 00:52:30,240
seven

1260
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:31,199
xlr

1261
00:52:30,239 --> 00:52:33,519
and

1262
00:52:31,199 --> 00:52:36,239
seven the xlr

1263
00:52:33,519 --> 00:52:37,280
uh type of seven

1264
00:52:36,239 --> 00:52:39,919
is

1265
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:42,559
the best because it'll hold on

1266
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:44,159
leaves that are more or less

1267
00:52:42,559 --> 00:52:47,119
waxy or

1268
00:52:44,159 --> 00:52:50,480
slick such as some of the grape leaves

1269
00:52:47,119 --> 00:52:52,960
and most of the blueberry leaves

1270
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:54,400
so seven does a good job but you do have

1271
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:56,559
some

1272
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:58,400
problems there if you're doing it at

1273
00:52:56,559 --> 00:53:00,800
harvest because you have to wait seven

1274
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:03,760
days if you use seven

1275
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:06,160
and uh so that's one of the hold backs

1276
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:06,160
on it

1277
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:09,358
but there's other things that you can

1278
00:53:08,159 --> 00:53:12,879
use

1279
00:53:09,358 --> 00:53:15,199
that do a pretty good job and so

1280
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:18,160
if you want to harvest real soon after

1281
00:53:15,199 --> 00:53:19,358
spring then you've got to watch the

1282
00:53:18,159 --> 00:53:21,118
the uh

1283
00:53:19,358 --> 00:53:22,400
the phi

1284
00:53:21,119 --> 00:53:24,720
on those

1285
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:26,838
those uh

1286
00:53:24,719 --> 00:53:29,759
different

1287
00:53:26,838 --> 00:53:32,960
pesticides i think all of those that are

1288
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:35,520
listed there are labeled four

1289
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:37,119
blueberries in at least in ohio in some

1290
00:53:35,519 --> 00:53:40,000
way or another

1291
00:53:37,119 --> 00:53:42,640
the mustang max is labeled for other

1292
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:44,559
insects not japanese beetle

1293
00:53:42,639 --> 00:53:47,920
but it could be used

1294
00:53:44,559 --> 00:53:47,920
for the other insects

1295
00:53:49,119 --> 00:53:53,760
okay uh seasonal trapping of japanese

1296
00:53:52,639 --> 00:53:56,078
beetle

1297
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:57,680
this is more or less uh

1298
00:53:56,079 --> 00:53:58,880
systematic

1299
00:53:57,679 --> 00:54:01,838
in that

1300
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:04,160
most of our peaks for japanese beetle

1301
00:54:01,838 --> 00:54:06,318
come out sometime in

1302
00:54:04,159 --> 00:54:08,558
august there usually

1303
00:54:06,318 --> 00:54:08,558
but

1304
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:14,318
this year i was just over in portugal in

1305
00:54:12,559 --> 00:54:17,519
uh

1306
00:54:14,318 --> 00:54:18,400
in november and uh

1307
00:54:17,519 --> 00:54:21,119
on the

1308
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:24,240
azores there they had noticed something

1309
00:54:21,119 --> 00:54:27,280
really strange about their population

1310
00:54:24,239 --> 00:54:28,879
because the peaks all were in late

1311
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:31,519
september

1312
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:33,039
and we'd never have experienced them

1313
00:54:31,519 --> 00:54:36,000
quite that late we've we've seen them

1314
00:54:33,039 --> 00:54:39,119
range into there but most of it is

1315
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:41,519
usually in august so we're not sure

1316
00:54:39,119 --> 00:54:43,760
exactly why the peaks are changing but

1317
00:54:41,519 --> 00:54:45,199
they speculate that maybe global warming

1318
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:46,079
is having something to do with it out

1319
00:54:45,199 --> 00:54:49,318
there

1320
00:54:46,079 --> 00:54:49,318
in the azores

1321
00:54:52,639 --> 00:54:57,679
all right that's just uh to kind of give

1322
00:54:55,440 --> 00:55:00,960
you an idea of where you might be able

1323
00:54:57,679 --> 00:55:02,719
to control japanese beetles either in

1324
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:05,599
the grub stage

1325
00:55:02,719 --> 00:55:07,919
and which methods you could use and also

1326
00:55:05,599 --> 00:55:09,838
in the adult stage i'll go over that a

1327
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:11,920
little bit more

1328
00:55:09,838 --> 00:55:15,440
as we go

1329
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:17,920
into the other slides another option

1330
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:21,039
here for controlling spores and this is

1331
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:23,680
particularly in high value places such

1332
00:55:21,039 --> 00:55:27,759
as golf course greens and so forth

1333
00:55:23,679 --> 00:55:27,759
milky spore could be used

1334
00:55:29,119 --> 00:55:34,480
milky spore is of course

1335
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:36,318
pretty expensive

1336
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:38,400
and it was actually taken off the market

1337
00:55:36,318 --> 00:55:40,798
here about 10 years ago because they

1338
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:42,639
started checking the shelf life of some

1339
00:55:40,798 --> 00:55:45,358
of the milky spore

1340
00:55:42,639 --> 00:55:47,118
disease that was for sale and it wasn't

1341
00:55:45,358 --> 00:55:49,519
up to snuff so

1342
00:55:47,119 --> 00:55:50,559
uh the usda made them take it off and

1343
00:55:49,519 --> 00:55:53,519
then be

1344
00:55:50,559 --> 00:55:55,680
checked so now the spore counts are up

1345
00:55:53,519 --> 00:55:58,400
and it it looks like it's working much

1346
00:55:55,679 --> 00:56:02,000
better but you can run up

1347
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:04,079
something like 350 360 dollars an acre

1348
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:06,079
if you put it down the way they

1349
00:56:04,079 --> 00:56:09,200
recommend in lines

1350
00:56:06,079 --> 00:56:10,798
uh even on golf courses or your backyard

1351
00:56:09,199 --> 00:56:12,798
or something like that

1352
00:56:10,798 --> 00:56:14,000
so not very many people do it and then

1353
00:56:12,798 --> 00:56:16,400
of course the other thing you have to

1354
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:19,199
worry about on japanese beetle

1355
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:20,639
is that the adults are such strong

1356
00:56:19,199 --> 00:56:22,000
flyers

1357
00:56:20,639 --> 00:56:24,400
that you're not going to really do

1358
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:26,960
yourself very much good

1359
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:29,760
by putting it in your yard and

1360
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:31,920
to to rid yourself of the adults anyway

1361
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:33,599
you might get rid of the grubs

1362
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:35,838
but the adults are going to be flying

1363
00:56:33,599 --> 00:56:38,240
into your roses and and other things

1364
00:56:35,838 --> 00:56:38,239
anyway

1365
00:56:38,719 --> 00:56:42,318
one of the tests that we did this past

1366
00:56:40,798 --> 00:56:45,358
summer

1367
00:56:42,318 --> 00:56:47,838
with the blueberry grower here we were

1368
00:56:45,358 --> 00:56:51,358
trying to look at some

1369
00:56:47,838 --> 00:56:53,119
different fungi that would uh might

1370
00:56:51,358 --> 00:56:55,920
control japanese beetles so we used

1371
00:56:53,119 --> 00:56:59,760
typical japanese beetle trap

1372
00:56:55,920 --> 00:57:01,039
on top of this uh auto dissemination

1373
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:05,119
trap

1374
00:57:01,039 --> 00:57:05,119
and as you can see it's kind of a

1375
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:10,318
interesting

1376
00:57:07,519 --> 00:57:13,039
makeup of it it's not too easy to

1377
00:57:10,318 --> 00:57:14,960
go through but uh the japanese beetles

1378
00:57:13,039 --> 00:57:18,159
come into their lures and then they fall

1379
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:18,159
down let me use the

1380
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:22,280
where is my uh

1381
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:31,039
i didn't get it i'm trying to get my

1382
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:32,559
pointer

1383
00:57:31,039 --> 00:57:35,358
now i got it

1384
00:57:32,559 --> 00:57:36,720
the japanese beetles all fall down into

1385
00:57:35,358 --> 00:57:38,639
here

1386
00:57:36,719 --> 00:57:40,318
and uh

1387
00:57:38,639 --> 00:57:42,239
this seems to have a little bit more

1388
00:57:40,318 --> 00:57:44,558
room than the ones we made here but

1389
00:57:42,239 --> 00:57:46,719
they're the same design actually

1390
00:57:44,559 --> 00:57:48,559
except that they have a thicker

1391
00:57:46,719 --> 00:57:50,719
um top and bottom

1392
00:57:48,559 --> 00:57:53,200
and then this little door right here is

1393
00:57:50,719 --> 00:57:57,118
where you put your petri dish in

1394
00:57:53,199 --> 00:58:00,399
full of your either bovaria like we used

1395
00:57:57,119 --> 00:58:02,160
or the metaresium which we use in the

1396
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:05,519
azores

1397
00:58:02,159 --> 00:58:08,558
so the the beetles fall fall down

1398
00:58:05,519 --> 00:58:11,199
they come down into here and the main

1399
00:58:08,559 --> 00:58:13,519
problem or one of the problems could be

1400
00:58:11,199 --> 00:58:16,078
water because it collects rainfall and

1401
00:58:13,519 --> 00:58:18,400
just forces it down so underneath this

1402
00:58:16,079 --> 00:58:20,400
there's a screen

1403
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:22,639
to let the water out then the beetles

1404
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:25,280
are supposed to walk across this petri

1405
00:58:22,639 --> 00:58:27,519
dish that's inside this door

1406
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:29,599
being attracted out to this light over

1407
00:58:27,519 --> 00:58:32,159
here that's just a piece of glass in

1408
00:58:29,599 --> 00:58:33,599
there and this is just open for them to

1409
00:58:32,159 --> 00:58:35,279
fall out

1410
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:37,838
of the bottom

1411
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:37,839
and

1412
00:58:38,239 --> 00:58:45,919
so that uh that works pretty good we've

1413
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:45,920
we've done our test by by using this

1414
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:52,880
uh in oklahoma

1415
00:58:50,719 --> 00:58:55,279
well it's been three or four years ago

1416
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:57,039
they had such dry conditions and so

1417
00:58:55,280 --> 00:59:00,079
forth they decided to you that they

1418
00:58:57,039 --> 00:59:01,838
would use a wet auger

1419
00:59:00,079 --> 00:59:03,760
uh petri dish

1420
00:59:01,838 --> 00:59:05,199
and put it in as the spores were

1421
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:06,880
developing

1422
00:59:05,199 --> 00:59:08,239
so that they wouldn't get blown around

1423
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:10,559
so much

1424
00:59:08,239 --> 00:59:10,558
and

1425
00:59:11,119 --> 00:59:17,599
so they designed a new trap

1426
00:59:14,798 --> 00:59:19,920
auto dissemination trap which was made

1427
00:59:17,599 --> 00:59:20,880
out of pvc pipe

1428
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:21,680
and

1429
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:23,119
it

1430
00:59:21,679 --> 00:59:25,679
worked pretty good but they didn't

1431
00:59:23,119 --> 00:59:28,480
really do enough testing to know

1432
00:59:25,679 --> 00:59:33,118
if it was going to be satisfactory

1433
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:36,318
for you know killing a lot of beetles

1434
00:59:33,119 --> 00:59:39,599
uh here we have just a slide this

1435
00:59:36,318 --> 00:59:41,440
mentioning that we have

1436
00:59:39,599 --> 00:59:44,318
a fly

1437
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:48,880
and also a

1438
00:59:44,318 --> 00:59:48,880
little wasp that uh

1439
00:59:50,239 --> 00:59:55,919
that uh also that attacked the uh the

1440
00:59:53,519 --> 01:00:00,000
the japanese beetle they've been

1441
00:59:55,920 --> 01:00:03,358
introduced and they do a fairly good job

1442
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:05,119
a fair job i might say on one of the

1443
01:00:03,358 --> 01:00:07,358
golf courses or several of the golf

1444
01:00:05,119 --> 01:00:10,000
courses i believe up in connecticut

1445
01:00:07,358 --> 01:00:12,400
we've tried to introduce them into ohio

1446
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:14,559
and we have had absolutely no luck in

1447
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:17,440
getting anything established they've

1448
01:00:14,559 --> 01:00:20,240
moved them uh to the mountain areas near

1449
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:22,880
boone north carolina and there's an area

1450
01:00:20,239 --> 01:00:24,798
up in there five or six miles

1451
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:26,798
that is supposed to have pretty good

1452
01:00:24,798 --> 01:00:29,599
control from these

1453
01:00:26,798 --> 01:00:32,480
parasites and predators

1454
01:00:29,599 --> 01:00:35,039
uh the pheromone

1455
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:37,760
is uh

1456
01:00:35,039 --> 01:00:42,719
something that was developed here

1457
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:44,720
uh in worcester by t lead and mccline

1458
01:00:42,719 --> 01:00:47,439
some of you probably know them

1459
01:00:44,719 --> 01:00:49,919
and so though they're used along with

1460
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:52,480
the feeding attractant

1461
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:54,798
to uh

1462
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:58,079
to attract in

1463
01:00:54,798 --> 01:01:00,559
the beetles uh to our auto dissemination

1464
01:00:58,079 --> 01:01:00,559
traps

1465
01:01:07,039 --> 01:01:13,599
okay this one was put in uh and then we

1466
01:01:11,599 --> 01:01:15,838
did didn't take it back out but

1467
01:01:13,599 --> 01:01:17,838
unfortunately

1468
01:01:15,838 --> 01:01:20,558
this was developed

1469
01:01:17,838 --> 01:01:23,199
and they i actually isolated something

1470
01:01:20,559 --> 01:01:25,200
that would

1471
01:01:23,199 --> 01:01:28,000
shut down the identification of the

1472
01:01:25,199 --> 01:01:30,960
pheromone and uh

1473
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:32,960
so that you it couldn't be detected

1474
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:34,798
but uh

1475
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:36,639
it worked in the laboratory but it

1476
01:01:34,798 --> 01:01:38,960
wasn't field tested

1477
01:01:36,639 --> 01:01:40,719
so after some more testing and maybe

1478
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:42,880
using some different methods they'll be

1479
01:01:40,719 --> 01:01:45,679
able to work something out the guy that

1480
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:50,838
developed this is one of the leading

1481
01:01:45,679 --> 01:01:53,440
guys on beetle especially uh scarab

1482
01:01:50,838 --> 01:01:54,960
pheromones and so he's really good at

1483
01:01:53,440 --> 01:01:57,920
and he thinks that this has some real

1484
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:59,679
possibilities

1485
01:01:57,920 --> 01:02:02,639
uh

1486
01:01:59,679 --> 01:02:04,879
nematodes are another thing that are

1487
01:02:02,639 --> 01:02:06,798
useful in uh

1488
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:08,318
especially in golf courses and high

1489
01:02:06,798 --> 01:02:11,759
value places

1490
01:02:08,318 --> 01:02:14,159
we have a scientist here by the name of

1491
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:15,359
parwan degree wall who's working on that

1492
01:02:14,159 --> 01:02:17,279
aspect

1493
01:02:15,358 --> 01:02:20,480
and having some pretty good luck as far

1494
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:24,400
as golf greens and things like that and

1495
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:24,400
using it on a lot of different insects

1496
01:02:30,239 --> 01:02:34,798
okay

1497
01:02:32,318 --> 01:02:38,639
the material that we've been using in

1498
01:02:34,798 --> 01:02:40,079
this auto dissemination trap

1499
01:02:38,639 --> 01:02:42,400
is

1500
01:02:40,079 --> 01:02:44,960
uh a bulvaria

1501
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:50,079
and we've been using bovaria here and

1502
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:51,519
over in the azores we've been using uh

1503
01:02:50,079 --> 01:02:53,680
i can't think of the name of it right

1504
01:02:51,519 --> 01:02:55,759
now macronut huh

1505
01:02:53,679 --> 01:02:57,679
medarisium midrisium

1506
01:02:55,760 --> 01:03:00,799
uh they're kind of similar

1507
01:02:57,679 --> 01:03:03,440
uh the bulbaria

1508
01:03:00,798 --> 01:03:06,880
is uh

1509
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:09,519
gives white spores and this company that

1510
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:12,079
i wasn't familiar with until recently

1511
01:03:09,519 --> 01:03:14,000
has helped us uh and supplied us with

1512
01:03:12,079 --> 01:03:15,519
material and

1513
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:17,760
we're kind of

1514
01:03:15,519 --> 01:03:19,119
happy with that

1515
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:21,039
and

1516
01:03:19,119 --> 01:03:23,680
we didn't change the formulation at all

1517
01:03:21,039 --> 01:03:26,319
we just used what came commercially

1518
01:03:23,679 --> 01:03:29,358
and that's what we put our

1519
01:03:26,318 --> 01:03:33,279
traps out with we set our traps without

1520
01:03:29,358 --> 01:03:33,279
using their their products

1521
01:03:33,358 --> 01:03:37,920
and here again this is the trap

1522
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:40,000
that we use though about the only

1523
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:42,880
difference from the one

1524
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:45,599
that's been used before

1525
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:47,280
they're in the azores is this trap

1526
01:03:45,599 --> 01:03:49,838
is a different kind of japanese beetle

1527
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:51,920
trap and it actually goes down inside a

1528
01:03:49,838 --> 01:03:54,558
little bit and that makes it a little

1529
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:57,440
bit restricted there but here you can

1530
01:03:54,559 --> 01:04:00,640
see that we we use sponges

1531
01:03:57,440 --> 01:04:02,318
and we put the mixtures in the with

1532
01:04:00,639 --> 01:04:05,038
water usually

1533
01:04:02,318 --> 01:04:07,199
uh and the the sponge

1534
01:04:05,039 --> 01:04:08,240
in there and let the the beetles would

1535
01:04:07,199 --> 01:04:12,598
walk from

1536
01:04:08,239 --> 01:04:12,598
let me get the pointer here

1537
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:17,039
okay the beetles come down

1538
01:04:15,440 --> 01:04:19,039
in through

1539
01:04:17,039 --> 01:04:20,799
here

1540
01:04:19,039 --> 01:04:22,640
and then they get clogged up there a

1541
01:04:20,798 --> 01:04:24,400
little bit if there's too many of them

1542
01:04:22,639 --> 01:04:26,318
but anyway they're supposed to walk

1543
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:28,639
inside

1544
01:04:26,318 --> 01:04:30,318
over this

1545
01:04:28,639 --> 01:04:31,838
sponge

1546
01:04:30,318 --> 01:04:34,079
or without the sponge some of them we

1547
01:04:31,838 --> 01:04:36,318
had it out and just plain water for the

1548
01:04:34,079 --> 01:04:39,039
check and then when they would be

1549
01:04:36,318 --> 01:04:40,960
released actually would usually

1550
01:04:39,039 --> 01:04:43,119
plans are in the future they would just

1551
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:46,079
be released here we were collecting them

1552
01:04:43,119 --> 01:04:48,240
so we could do bio essays in the lab on

1553
01:04:46,079 --> 01:04:50,559
them

1554
01:04:48,239 --> 01:04:50,558
okay

1555
01:04:53,119 --> 01:04:57,838
and here you can see

1556
01:04:55,199 --> 01:04:59,199
another one here you can see down inside

1557
01:04:57,838 --> 01:05:01,199
of a trap

1558
01:04:59,199 --> 01:05:02,318
showing the number of beetles that

1559
01:05:01,199 --> 01:05:04,558
actually

1560
01:05:02,318 --> 01:05:06,558
built up there a little bit and so they

1561
01:05:04,559 --> 01:05:07,680
build up too much sometimes they can get

1562
01:05:06,559 --> 01:05:09,280
away

1563
01:05:07,679 --> 01:05:10,879
but

1564
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:13,200
that's basically what it looks like you

1565
01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:16,480
can see underneath here where the

1566
01:05:13,199 --> 01:05:20,279
uh most a lot of more congregating i'm

1567
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:20,280
not showing you with your

1568
01:05:23,199 --> 01:05:27,919
i'm not having any luck now i think i've

1569
01:05:25,599 --> 01:05:27,920
got it

1570
01:05:28,079 --> 01:05:34,000
anyway uh right under the trap

1571
01:05:31,039 --> 01:05:35,119
uh there we put some duct tape there

1572
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,798
because too many of them were

1573
01:05:35,119 --> 01:05:39,440
congregating there trying to get out

1574
01:05:36,798 --> 01:05:41,358
rather than going down to the other end

1575
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:44,798
and walking through the

1576
01:05:41,358 --> 01:05:47,759
the fungus to get out

1577
01:05:44,798 --> 01:05:49,838
and that worked pretty well

1578
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:50,960
here you can see a little bit of

1579
01:05:49,838 --> 01:05:52,480
different

1580
01:05:50,960 --> 01:05:54,000
situations

1581
01:05:52,480 --> 01:05:56,318
where the

1582
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:57,119
how the trap was set up

1583
01:05:56,318 --> 01:05:59,679
and

1584
01:05:57,119 --> 01:05:59,680
we used

1585
01:06:00,159 --> 01:06:03,358
just regular

1586
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:05,519
ring

1587
01:06:03,358 --> 01:06:06,798
jars or canisters on the bottom to

1588
01:06:05,519 --> 01:06:08,480
collect them when we were going to do

1589
01:06:06,798 --> 01:06:11,920
some tests with them

1590
01:06:08,480 --> 01:06:11,920
these are the different uh

1591
01:06:12,079 --> 01:06:15,280
different

1592
01:06:13,599 --> 01:06:17,119
treatments that we use the different

1593
01:06:15,280 --> 01:06:20,400
five different treatments

1594
01:06:17,119 --> 01:06:23,838
the first one we had the spray

1595
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:26,318
in a petri dish sponge in a petri dish

1596
01:06:23,838 --> 01:06:28,639
second one no sponge

1597
01:06:26,318 --> 01:06:30,159
the third one

1598
01:06:28,639 --> 01:06:32,480
with the sponge

1599
01:06:30,159 --> 01:06:36,078
at a different concentration

1600
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:38,639
and then the fourth one was the powder

1601
01:06:36,079 --> 01:06:41,920
uh in the petri dish

1602
01:06:38,639 --> 01:06:44,920
and that had uh without watering without

1603
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:44,920
sponge

1604
01:06:47,440 --> 01:06:50,318
and so

1605
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:55,760
that was this one here

1606
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:58,240
which did the best and that was just the

1607
01:06:55,760 --> 01:07:01,440
powder itself with not not works with

1608
01:06:58,239 --> 01:07:03,919
mixed with water and with no sponge

1609
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:06,920
so you can see i need to get my pointer

1610
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:06,920
here

1611
01:07:14,159 --> 01:07:18,318
okay

1612
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:19,200
so these right here these tall this tall

1613
01:07:18,318 --> 01:07:20,000
one

1614
01:07:19,199 --> 01:07:21,598
uh

1615
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:24,960
that was the best and that was just the

1616
01:07:21,599 --> 01:07:24,960
powder that they sold

1617
01:07:27,519 --> 01:07:30,880
okay so uh

1618
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:35,920
i'll go to the next slide there but

1619
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:38,079
anyway you can see that the the ones

1620
01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:39,440
where we mix water in the sponge

1621
01:07:38,079 --> 01:07:41,039
uh

1622
01:07:39,440 --> 01:07:43,679
didn't do as good

1623
01:07:41,039 --> 01:07:46,559
and that's just a later version of it we

1624
01:07:43,679 --> 01:07:48,000
we put those did that bio essay on the

1625
01:07:46,559 --> 01:07:51,039
27th

1626
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:52,719
of august and then the 7th of september

1627
01:07:51,039 --> 01:07:55,680
we did another one this is what the

1628
01:07:52,719 --> 01:07:58,318
japanese beetles look like

1629
01:07:55,679 --> 01:08:00,318
that have it now if this is mediresium

1630
01:07:58,318 --> 01:08:03,838
of course these would be green spores

1631
01:08:00,318 --> 01:08:03,838
but look look very similar

1632
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:10,798
just a little bit closer up

1633
01:08:08,318 --> 01:08:13,279
picture of those but you can still tell

1634
01:08:10,798 --> 01:08:14,559
that they're japanese beetles

1635
01:08:13,280 --> 01:08:17,600
uh

1636
01:08:14,559 --> 01:08:19,359
roger yeah actually keep your um

1637
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:21,600
your microphone on for a sec because i

1638
01:08:19,359 --> 01:08:23,920
think we have a couple of questions

1639
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:25,279
um there were there was one interesting

1640
01:08:23,920 --> 01:08:27,759
one and

1641
01:08:25,279 --> 01:08:29,679
carl asks how does increasing the soil

1642
01:08:27,759 --> 01:08:30,798
organic matter help to manage the

1643
01:08:29,679 --> 01:08:33,759
japanese

1644
01:08:30,798 --> 01:08:36,920
beetle population can you speak to that

1645
01:08:33,759 --> 01:08:36,920
at all

1646
01:08:46,640 --> 01:08:53,359
uh well the japanese beetle grubs they

1647
01:08:50,158 --> 01:08:54,158
kind of thrive on organic matter

1648
01:08:53,359 --> 01:08:57,279
so

1649
01:08:54,158 --> 01:08:59,119
uh okay it depends you know if it's the

1650
01:08:57,279 --> 01:09:02,480
kind of they like or not but they really

1651
01:08:59,119 --> 01:09:04,798
like grass uh roots i think that's their

1652
01:09:02,479 --> 01:09:07,198
preference seems like it might not so

1653
01:09:04,798 --> 01:09:09,600
that's a that's a good thing so i really

1654
01:09:07,198 --> 01:09:12,318
can't tell you how the organic matter

1655
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:14,640
would help reduce them i can't think of

1656
01:09:12,319 --> 01:09:14,640
a way

1657
01:09:15,439 --> 01:09:19,838
yeah

1658
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:22,000
yeah like the the green june bug you

1659
01:09:19,838 --> 01:09:23,039
know thrives on the underside of the

1660
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:25,039
veils

1661
01:09:23,039 --> 01:09:27,119
um and a couple of the questions that

1662
01:09:25,039 --> 01:09:30,238
were asked earlier in the presentation

1663
01:09:27,119 --> 01:09:33,358
for example is the springtiffia wasp uh

1664
01:09:30,238 --> 01:09:36,158
i think that was mentioned as a way to

1665
01:09:33,359 --> 01:09:40,159
manage japanese beetles

1666
01:09:36,158 --> 01:09:43,198
and there was another question about

1667
01:09:40,158 --> 01:09:45,838
technic flies specifically and i'm not

1668
01:09:43,198 --> 01:09:46,879
sure if that was the species of fly that

1669
01:09:45,838 --> 01:09:49,679
is

1670
01:09:46,880 --> 01:09:52,679
helpful in controlling japanese beetles

1671
01:09:49,679 --> 01:09:52,679
roger

1672
01:10:02,399 --> 01:10:07,359
yeah both of these things are good and

1673
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:09,520
we've really we've tried you know many

1674
01:10:07,359 --> 01:10:11,039
times to introduce them into the azores

1675
01:10:09,520 --> 01:10:12,880
where we figured that climate would be a

1676
01:10:11,039 --> 01:10:14,960
little bit milder and then we've tried

1677
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:17,760
to introduce them here into worcester

1678
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:18,800
where we have you know moderately cold

1679
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:20,960
climate

1680
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:23,279
and we have just haven't done very much

1681
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:24,239
good at all so it's just a hit or miss

1682
01:10:23,279 --> 01:10:26,158
thing

1683
01:10:24,238 --> 01:10:28,479
now

1684
01:10:26,158 --> 01:10:30,799
whether they can be counted on i don't

1685
01:10:28,479 --> 01:10:34,399
know but there where that

1686
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:37,520
one is uh established in uh

1687
01:10:34,399 --> 01:10:39,279
connecticut um is there a crab crop that

1688
01:10:37,520 --> 01:10:41,760
is effective for blueberries that was

1689
01:10:39,279 --> 01:10:45,840
one of the questions but i don't know of

1690
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:47,600
any wide spread thing

1691
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:51,360
i i know we usually just say put

1692
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:51,360
raspberries near them but

1693
01:10:52,238 --> 01:10:56,319
a trap crop

1694
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,319
yeah

1695
01:10:56,399 --> 01:11:00,719
and then i have a question it was a

1696
01:10:58,319 --> 01:11:02,639
comment made privately but

1697
01:11:00,719 --> 01:11:05,600
do you know if they've tried using

1698
01:11:02,640 --> 01:11:08,000
infrared on conveyor belts to see if

1699
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:09,120
that actually pops the japanese beetles

1700
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:11,439
apparently

1701
01:11:09,119 --> 01:11:14,800
this technology is being used to control

1702
01:11:11,439 --> 01:11:14,799
some pests of grains

1703
01:11:23,359 --> 01:11:28,238
i do not know that uh yeah and then

1704
01:11:26,238 --> 01:11:30,959
we've got a question about the

1705
01:11:28,238 --> 01:11:32,559
effectiveness of milky spore in colder

1706
01:11:30,960 --> 01:11:34,480
climates many of the folks that are

1707
01:11:32,560 --> 01:11:36,880
logged on are actually

1708
01:11:34,479 --> 01:11:38,000
from new england area and upstate new

1709
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:40,239
york

1710
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:42,560
d um i know that in there was some

1711
01:11:40,238 --> 01:11:44,718
studies done at cornell that

1712
01:11:42,560 --> 01:11:47,360
implied that milky spore was not very

1713
01:11:44,719 --> 01:11:50,239
effective uh it just didn't get it

1714
01:11:47,359 --> 01:11:51,439
didn't build up enough of a population

1715
01:11:50,238 --> 01:11:55,319
have you

1716
01:11:51,439 --> 01:11:55,319
read anything more recently

1717
01:12:02,399 --> 01:12:07,039
no i haven't the the latest thing i've

1718
01:12:05,600 --> 01:12:09,679
personally talked to that's

1719
01:12:07,039 --> 01:12:12,079
knowledgeable on that is mick klein

1720
01:12:09,679 --> 01:12:14,239
and he seems to think here you know for

1721
01:12:12,079 --> 01:12:15,679
the the conditions we have here which

1722
01:12:14,238 --> 01:12:18,399
are pretty cold

1723
01:12:15,679 --> 01:12:21,600
uh that it's working pretty good now but

1724
01:12:18,399 --> 01:12:23,759
for a while there the shelf life

1725
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:26,400
just wasn't any good

1726
01:12:23,760 --> 01:12:28,480
and so they made them step that up and

1727
01:12:26,399 --> 01:12:30,000
now they they release it for them to

1728
01:12:28,479 --> 01:12:31,279
sell it and actually

1729
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,399
and i just wonder if the studies could

1730
01:12:31,279 --> 01:12:34,479
have been done i'm sorry for

1731
01:12:32,399 --> 01:12:37,119
interrupting i just i was reading this

1732
01:12:34,479 --> 01:12:40,639
um thing from satin ambassador he

1733
01:12:37,119 --> 01:12:41,439
comments that infrared was used um at a

1734
01:12:40,640 --> 01:12:44,320
a

1735
01:12:41,439 --> 01:12:46,799
nursery farm in michigan and so that's

1736
01:12:44,319 --> 01:12:47,599
really interesting to to see that that

1737
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:48,840
was

1738
01:12:47,600 --> 01:12:51,679
yeah

1739
01:12:48,840 --> 01:12:56,880
um there are a number of different

1740
01:12:51,679 --> 01:12:56,880
questions carl primarily about um

1741
01:12:57,359 --> 01:13:00,639
effectiveness of vertebrate and

1742
01:12:58,800 --> 01:13:03,520
invertebrate predators i'm assuming

1743
01:13:00,640 --> 01:13:05,600
you're talking about birds and

1744
01:13:03,520 --> 01:13:07,520
i think the invertebrates we've talked a

1745
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:10,719
little bit about nematodes and other

1746
01:13:07,520 --> 01:13:12,320
kinds of um parasites and other natural

1747
01:13:10,719 --> 01:13:14,158
controls

1748
01:13:12,319 --> 01:13:16,479
um

1749
01:13:14,158 --> 01:13:18,399
and then there's one more no-till does

1750
01:13:16,479 --> 01:13:20,639
no-till have adverse or beneficial

1751
01:13:18,399 --> 01:13:23,519
impacts on japanese

1752
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:27,960
beetle population

1753
01:13:23,520 --> 01:13:27,960
uh i don't know if that's been

1754
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:38,560
yeah i'm

1755
01:13:34,479 --> 01:13:39,279
i'm afraid that uh no-till would not uh

1756
01:13:38,560 --> 01:13:41,679
be

1757
01:13:39,279 --> 01:13:43,519
you know very uh good

1758
01:13:41,679 --> 01:13:45,119
because it would allow the grasses to

1759
01:13:43,520 --> 01:13:47,920
grow in there unless you came in and

1760
01:13:45,119 --> 01:13:50,079
wiped out the grasses too

1761
01:13:47,920 --> 01:13:51,920
but uh

1762
01:13:50,079 --> 01:13:55,600
we've seen some things where no-till

1763
01:13:51,920 --> 01:13:58,560
makes the insect problems worse you know

1764
01:13:55,600 --> 01:14:00,239
and uh so i don't know well i um because

1765
01:13:58,560 --> 01:14:02,560
we're starting to run out of time and

1766
01:14:00,238 --> 01:14:04,639
i'm sorry to cut you the questions off

1767
01:14:02,560 --> 01:14:07,440
but i just want to make sure that people

1768
01:14:04,640 --> 01:14:10,480
have time to download the

1769
01:14:07,439 --> 01:14:12,000
information sheets that i we mentioned

1770
01:14:10,479 --> 01:14:13,919
briefly at the beginning of the

1771
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:15,679
presentation

1772
01:14:13,920 --> 01:14:18,079
i don't know if anyone has any

1773
01:14:15,679 --> 01:14:19,840
additional questions for robert childs

1774
01:14:18,079 --> 01:14:22,559
or roger williams

1775
01:14:19,840 --> 01:14:24,079
i am very happy that they took time out

1776
01:14:22,560 --> 01:14:26,640
to

1777
01:14:24,079 --> 01:14:29,198
get their presentations ready and

1778
01:14:26,640 --> 01:14:31,760
practice and and learn this new kind of

1779
01:14:29,198 --> 01:14:34,799
delivery technique but i

1780
01:14:31,760 --> 01:14:37,520
am very very happy that you folks

1781
01:14:34,800 --> 01:14:39,199
participated i also want to remind

1782
01:14:37,520 --> 01:14:42,400

01:14:57,600 --> 01:15:04,199
be obnoxious with them but i don't want

1791
01:15:00,399 --> 01:15:04,198
people to forget about

1792
01:15:28,479 --> 01:15:32,198
