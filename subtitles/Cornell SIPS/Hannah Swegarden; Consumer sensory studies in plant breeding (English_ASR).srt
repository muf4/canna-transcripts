1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,309
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,679 --> 00:00:04,309
University

3
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:11,940
all right good afternoon I guess

4
00:00:09,718 --> 00:00:14,609
everyone my name is Hannah sway garden I

5
00:00:11,939 --> 00:00:15,388
am actually a PhD student in the section

6
00:00:14,609 --> 00:00:17,609
of horticulture

7
00:00:15,388 --> 00:00:19,379
however I am minoring in plant breeding

8
00:00:17,609 --> 00:00:21,449
in food science and I wanted to come

9
00:00:19,379 --> 00:00:23,399
here today to kind of talk to you about

10
00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:27,028
a small little project that's well not

11
00:00:23,399 --> 00:00:29,099
really so small anymore but involve of

12
00:00:27,028 --> 00:00:31,169
trying to connect consumers and plant

13
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:33,149
breeders and I thought that an

14
00:00:31,169 --> 00:00:34,649
imperative part of this project was that

15
00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:36,200
I actually communicate and talk to plant

16
00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:39,240
breeders as well which is why I'm here

17
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:41,010
today to give you a little bit of

18
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:42,420
background I work in a diversified

19
00:00:41,009 --> 00:00:43,890
vegetable breeding program is based out

20
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:46,590
of Geneva I work with dr. Philip

21
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:48,539
Griffith who works with several

22
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:51,570
different crops including snap beans dry

23
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:54,799
beans small fruit tomatoes and many coal

24
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:57,719
crops including cabbage and broccoli

25
00:00:54,799 --> 00:00:59,519
cauliflower and then as of recently

26
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:01,589
we've kind of been focusing a lot on the

27
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,480
leafy Brassica types which include kale

28
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:05,790
and collard types I'll just kind of give

29
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:07,560
you an example of the diversity we're

30
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:08,960
working with in the program we've kind

31
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:10,920
of taken some of the existing

32
00:01:08,959 --> 00:01:12,209
morphologies and the leafy Brassica

33
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:14,700
types which include kind of like a

34
00:01:12,209 --> 00:01:17,429
Collard or a Tuscan kale or a steep

35
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:19,710
curly kind of kale and really worked on

36
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:21,120
developing and enhancing the aesthetics

37
00:01:19,709 --> 00:01:23,309
of these different leafy types which

38
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:25,920
includes the leaf shape the leaf colors

39
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:27,780
and leaf sizes and so as of right now

40
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,460
we've got an immense amount of diversity

41
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:32,000
that quite frankly we don't really know

42
00:01:29,459 --> 00:01:35,280
what to do with and so that's kind of

43
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,829
where we sit and as a result we've kind

44
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:41,099
of taken an integrative approach since I

45
00:01:37,829 --> 00:01:43,650
started almost two years ago now with

46
00:01:41,099 --> 00:01:45,599
the program we've been working to

47
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:48,690
connect make connections with New York

48
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:50,429
City by performing chef's demonstrations

49
00:01:48,689 --> 00:01:51,810
are working with green markets and some

50
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:54,030
of the farmers markets down in the city

51
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:55,740
we engage with lots of seed industry

52
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:57,239
partners trying to get feedback having

53
00:01:55,739 --> 00:02:00,089
them come out through our field days and

54
00:01:57,239 --> 00:02:01,739
communicating with them and then as of

55
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:04,100
the summer we'll begin some of our

56
00:02:01,739 --> 00:02:06,929
on-farm trialing with some of these new

57
00:02:04,099 --> 00:02:09,899
diversified leafy Brassica hybrids and

58
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:11,760
so as such I think we get a really good

59
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:14,310
perspective of kind of who we might be

60
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:16,918
interacting with across the food system

61
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:19,629
in our breeding program but when I first

62
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:21,760
started in fall of 2015 I

63
00:02:19,629 --> 00:02:24,310
I did a lecture by New York Times

64
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:26,709
journalist Amy Harman and during that

65
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:28,870
lecture she made a call for scientists

66
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:31,390
who engage with the public in a more

67
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:33,250
empathetic discussion and I'm sure she

68
00:02:31,389 --> 00:02:34,779
was referring to stem community at large

69
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:35,979
but as a horticultural plant breeder I

70
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:37,719
kind of went through some

71
00:02:35,979 --> 00:02:39,459
self-reflection and really tried to

72
00:02:37,719 --> 00:02:41,139
think about how I was engaging with the

73
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:44,080
public and how our program specifically

74
00:02:41,139 --> 00:02:45,759
was engaging with the public and as such

75
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,740
I realized that there was really one

76
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:49,299
group that we don't directly connect

77
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:51,610
with all that often and that is in fact

78
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:53,290
a consumer while inherently I think we

79
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:55,230
understand as readers that our products

80
00:02:53,289 --> 00:02:58,810
end up in the marketplace and are

81
00:02:55,229 --> 00:03:01,329
consumed in some capacity we know we're

82
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:03,610
not always directly interacting with

83
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:07,030
them and the reason why I'm not entirely

84
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:10,480
sure is it that we viewed the volatility

85
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:13,030
of consumer feedback and market to crazy

86
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:14,500
to really kind of rap into something

87
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:16,659
that we can integrate into our breeding

88
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:18,490
program is it that we don't really know

89
00:03:16,659 --> 00:03:20,799
what consumer or we think that we don't

90
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:23,110
know what consumers want or consumers

91
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,640
don't really know what they want do we

92
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:26,080
view this interaction with consumers is

93
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:26,799
too time-consuming do we not have the

94
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,810
time for it

95
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:30,640
are their language or translation

96
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:33,250
barriers between plant breeders and

97
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:36,399
consumers or is there just in a lack of

98
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:39,129
established methodology that can be used

99
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:41,920
to connect these two these two players

100
00:03:39,129 --> 00:03:43,960
in the food system and while I said I

101
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:45,939
don't really have the answer I got

102
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:48,070
thinking that well if it is in fact it's

103
00:03:45,939 --> 00:03:50,229
last one that we don't have established

104
00:03:48,069 --> 00:03:52,419
methodology where can we find some and

105
00:03:50,229 --> 00:03:55,659
how can we begin to explore how to

106
00:03:52,419 --> 00:03:57,909
connect these two groups and the answer

107
00:03:55,659 --> 00:03:59,500
kind of came to me during a product

108
00:03:57,909 --> 00:04:01,270
development class that I was taking in

109
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:03,849
food science around the same time I

110
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:05,680
attended this Amy Harman seminar and

111
00:04:03,849 --> 00:04:07,539
during this product development class we

112
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,819
talked about the typical product food

113
00:04:07,539 --> 00:04:13,139
products development pipeline where it's

114
00:04:09,819 --> 00:04:16,569
this really just kind of semi linear

115
00:04:13,139 --> 00:04:21,069
product development scheme where it

116
00:04:16,569 --> 00:04:22,689
starts off with exploratory of ideas and

117
00:04:21,069 --> 00:04:23,920
concept development goes through a lot

118
00:04:22,689 --> 00:04:26,500
of qualitative and quantitative

119
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:28,090
iterations and then involve lots of

120
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:30,790
different feedbacks from downstream

121
00:04:28,089 --> 00:04:33,369
players including processors and

122
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:35,319
consumers and you get you

123
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:37,660
just have this really iterative complex

124
00:04:35,319 --> 00:04:40,120
kind of interaction that somehow leads

125
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:43,120
to a prototype and eventually scaling up

126
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:45,160
and release of a new food product and I

127
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:47,199
saw a lot of parallels between a food

128
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:48,880
product development pipeline and a plant

129
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:50,530
breeding pipeline as well that we kind

130
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:53,409
of go through that same exploratory

131
00:04:50,529 --> 00:04:55,059
trade concept identification we do our

132
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:57,310
population development prototype

133
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:58,990
development and then eventually get into

134
00:04:57,310 --> 00:05:00,579
some of the early testing advanced

135
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:02,860
testing and eventually hopefully a

136
00:05:00,579 --> 00:05:04,478
variety release as well and so I thought

137
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:05,740
that if we could see some parallels

138
00:05:04,478 --> 00:05:07,000
between the food product development

139
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:09,879
pipeline and plant breeding pipeline

140
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,550
maybe we can use some of those tactics

141
00:05:09,879 --> 00:05:13,959
and those methods that they use to in

142
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:16,870
the food product development pipelines

143
00:05:13,959 --> 00:05:20,948
as a means of connecting with consumers

144
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:23,379
and so I connected with the sensor

145
00:05:20,949 --> 00:05:25,300
evaluation center in the food science

146
00:05:23,379 --> 00:05:27,189
department to begin exploring

147
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:29,139
established sensory analysis and

148
00:05:27,189 --> 00:05:30,699
consumer marketing techniques that are

149
00:05:29,139 --> 00:05:34,600
used commonly throughout the food

150
00:05:30,699 --> 00:05:37,270
industry and once I began connecting

151
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:38,979
with the sensory evaluation center we

152
00:05:37,269 --> 00:05:40,959
decided to actually perform a case study

153
00:05:38,978 --> 00:05:44,379
using an establishment reading program

154
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:47,259
notably mine that we are in to see if

155
00:05:44,379 --> 00:05:49,329
there was any methodology that we could

156
00:05:47,259 --> 00:05:52,300
use on a more regular basis to connect

157
00:05:49,329 --> 00:05:53,918
with consumers and one of the methods

158
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:56,319
that we settled on to begin exploring

159
00:05:53,918 --> 00:05:58,029
was called qualitative multivariate

160
00:05:56,319 --> 00:06:01,000
analysis and this is a well-established

161
00:05:58,029 --> 00:06:02,529
product development tool that involves

162
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,620
eight different steps is really just

163
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:07,629
designed to expose the consumer and

164
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:09,879
participant to the product that you're

165
00:06:07,629 --> 00:06:12,579
interested in a really interim intimate

166
00:06:09,879 --> 00:06:14,110
setting so they become very familiar

167
00:06:12,579 --> 00:06:16,269
with the product and can describe it

168
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:18,520
beyond just sensory modalities their

169
00:06:16,269 --> 00:06:20,529
kind of initial marketing perspectives

170
00:06:18,519 --> 00:06:21,788
so they get a really in-depth look at

171
00:06:20,529 --> 00:06:25,089
the product that you're trying to

172
00:06:21,788 --> 00:06:26,829
develop and so through the use of this

173
00:06:25,089 --> 00:06:29,228
qualitative multivariate analysis also

174
00:06:26,829 --> 00:06:30,879
NOAA's qma we're hoping to do is

175
00:06:29,228 --> 00:06:33,519
understand the importance of different

176
00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:35,079
plant traits through the consumer lens

177
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:37,810
to kind of begin to create a trait

178
00:06:35,079 --> 00:06:39,490
hierarchy of sorts and then understand

179
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:41,439
what type of information we could draw

180
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:43,090
from consumers that would not only be

181
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:44,769
feasible to obtain for

182
00:06:43,089 --> 00:06:47,649
greater but also applicable to a point

183
00:06:44,769 --> 00:06:49,689
breeding program and then evaluate qma

184
00:06:47,649 --> 00:06:51,459
as methodology in and of itself is this

185
00:06:49,689 --> 00:06:55,180
a methodology that plant breeders would

186
00:06:51,459 --> 00:06:57,310
want to use on a semi-regular basis in

187
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:59,199
the first place but most importantly and

188
00:06:57,310 --> 00:07:01,569
probably the best part about this method

189
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:03,870
was that it would kind of use broad

190
00:07:01,569 --> 00:07:07,509
strokes to talk to consumers and as such

191
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:10,090
really provided a lot of opportunity to

192
00:07:07,509 --> 00:07:12,490
generate further hypotheses that we

193
00:07:10,089 --> 00:07:14,289
could use in our breeding programs to

194
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:15,819
connect with consumers as well and so

195
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:18,460
this was a platform that we use

196
00:07:15,819 --> 00:07:19,779
initially civ its began exploring the

197
00:07:18,459 --> 00:07:23,709
relationship between plant breeders and

198
00:07:19,779 --> 00:07:26,500
consumers so to get going we decided to

199
00:07:23,709 --> 00:07:29,109
use a model crop of kale you haven't

200
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:30,759
heard it's a little trendy right now and

201
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:33,250
I guess I didn't pick it just because

202
00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:35,288
it's kale in and of itself picked it

203
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:37,720
more because it has popularity and as

204
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:39,879
such consumer familiarity and just

205
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:41,350
provides a platform for conversation so

206
00:07:39,879 --> 00:07:43,029
it's not necessarily just about the kale

207
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:47,020
so we I think's a little bit beyond that

208
00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:49,689
but we had also the diversity of a

209
00:07:47,019 --> 00:07:51,490
product set so we could go into our

210
00:07:49,689 --> 00:07:53,439
breeding program and pick out six

211
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:56,769
different lines to give to consumers

212
00:07:53,439 --> 00:08:00,189
that represented a diversity in the kale

213
00:07:56,769 --> 00:08:02,199
product product category I guess you

214
00:08:00,189 --> 00:08:05,800
could say so the six different types we

215
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:07,598
looked at work all word type Tuscan kale

216
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:09,939
one of our yellowish kind of breeding

217
00:08:07,598 --> 00:08:14,319
lines a Portuguese trunk hyouta type

218
00:08:09,939 --> 00:08:17,259
with thick mid ribs a classic deep curl

219
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:19,959
kale and then kind of a fist Iberian

220
00:08:17,259 --> 00:08:22,329
kale as well and then once we had that

221
00:08:19,959 --> 00:08:25,598
products that identified we decided to

222
00:08:22,329 --> 00:08:28,329
bring on board 14 self-identified kale

223
00:08:25,598 --> 00:08:30,159
enthusiasts that just means that they

224
00:08:28,329 --> 00:08:33,370
were familiar with kale they prepared it

225
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:35,379
themselves and they liked it and they

226
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:37,060
were also creative and articulate and

227
00:08:35,379 --> 00:08:39,399
that was really imperative in this

228
00:08:37,059 --> 00:08:41,199
discussion because these participants

229
00:08:39,399 --> 00:08:43,569
were bringing home these six different

230
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,580
Leaf types trying them out consuming

231
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:46,959
them and journaling about them and we

232
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:49,230
needed them to come back and be able to

233
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:51,578
provide feedback so we couldn't really

234
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:53,110
tap into a consumer base that didn't

235
00:08:51,578 --> 00:08:56,189
like kale in the first place for this

236
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:59,039
this methodology but once we had our

237
00:08:56,190 --> 00:09:01,529
our product set and our participants

238
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:03,629
identified we sent them home with these

239
00:09:01,528 --> 00:09:05,490
six different leaf types and over the

240
00:09:03,629 --> 00:09:07,589
course of two weeks the consumers

241
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:10,528
prepared these leaf types however they

242
00:09:07,589 --> 00:09:12,509
liked and then they were required to

243
00:09:10,528 --> 00:09:14,639
just journal about their experiences and

244
00:09:12,509 --> 00:09:18,389
document their experiences through a

245
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:20,490
photo journal as well at the end of that

246
00:09:18,389 --> 00:09:22,500
two weeks we brought all the consumers

247
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:24,028
back in for a facilitated focus group

248
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:26,519
this is a pretty intense three hour

249
00:09:24,028 --> 00:09:27,740
session in which we picked apart every

250
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:29,879
emotion you could probably have

251
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:33,720
regarding kales purchasing and

252
00:09:29,879 --> 00:09:36,000
consumption but throughout that we yes

253
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:37,889
as I said we mentioned we picked apart

254
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,929
associated motions we developed a

255
00:09:37,889 --> 00:09:42,688
lexicon and did lexicon exercises to

256
00:09:39,929 --> 00:09:45,419
kind of identify what consumers were

257
00:09:42,688 --> 00:09:48,269
what words and descriptors consumers

258
00:09:45,419 --> 00:09:51,149
were using to describe Kayle sensory

259
00:09:48,269 --> 00:09:53,188
modalities and then we picked apart

260
00:09:51,149 --> 00:09:55,049
contextual associations so were

261
00:09:53,188 --> 00:09:57,328
different leaf types associated with

262
00:09:55,049 --> 00:09:59,309
different culinary preparations we also

263
00:09:57,328 --> 00:10:00,899
perform projective mapping exercises

264
00:09:59,309 --> 00:10:03,809
which essentially just allowed the

265
00:10:00,899 --> 00:10:05,730
participants to identify axes of

266
00:10:03,809 --> 00:10:08,068
importance and then place those

267
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:10,379
different varieties along those axes in

268
00:10:08,068 --> 00:10:12,088
order to identify relationships among

269
00:10:10,379 --> 00:10:13,470
those different leaf types that makes

270
00:10:12,089 --> 00:10:16,319
sense and all the information when we

271
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:18,629
took on this facilitated focus group was

272
00:10:16,318 --> 00:10:20,578
used to build a value diagram a trait

273
00:10:18,629 --> 00:10:21,929
hierarchy and then an online candle

274
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:25,528
survey which I'll talk about in a little

275
00:10:21,929 --> 00:10:27,149
bit now walking out in this focus group

276
00:10:25,528 --> 00:10:28,559
we ended up with a lot of qualitative

277
00:10:27,149 --> 00:10:33,958
information which was kind of new

278
00:10:28,559 --> 00:10:37,138
territory for me and a lot more of value

279
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:39,929
oriented and value descriptors and

280
00:10:37,139 --> 00:10:41,879
emotions that I was expecting to but

281
00:10:39,929 --> 00:10:45,629
some preliminary results that we got was

282
00:10:41,879 --> 00:10:48,778
that there was a preconceived iconic

283
00:10:45,629 --> 00:10:50,220
Kayle that was in art was already

284
00:10:48,778 --> 00:10:53,370
defined in the consumers mind and that

285
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:55,528
was kind of this weepy curly kale type

286
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:57,509
and so that was kind of the current

287
00:10:55,528 --> 00:11:00,208
market class that we were confined to

288
00:10:57,509 --> 00:11:03,089
when we were were discussing kale so

289
00:11:00,208 --> 00:11:04,948
trying to push the consumer definition

290
00:11:03,089 --> 00:11:08,370
of a market class in the boundaries of

291
00:11:04,948 --> 00:11:09,490
what a consumer is calling kale might be

292
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:11,889
difficult and so that some

293
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:14,948
that we need to consider when we go

294
00:11:11,889 --> 00:11:16,619
about marketing or talking about some of

295
00:11:14,948 --> 00:11:18,969
our diversity in our breeding program

296
00:11:16,619 --> 00:11:20,889
consumers also emphasized the importance

297
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:22,769
of what we call freshness indicators so

298
00:11:20,889 --> 00:11:24,789
how to have good store ability which

299
00:11:22,769 --> 00:11:27,278
differentiates kale from a lot of other

300
00:11:24,789 --> 00:11:30,549
leafy greens texture was extremely

301
00:11:27,278 --> 00:11:33,369
important and the kale also needed to

302
00:11:30,549 --> 00:11:35,289
retain its shape throughout a shape and

303
00:11:33,369 --> 00:11:37,540
form throughout cooking and processing

304
00:11:35,289 --> 00:11:38,740
as well I think perhaps one of the

305
00:11:37,539 --> 00:11:41,828
biggest things that we got out of this

306
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:44,740
was that texture was one of the most

307
00:11:41,828 --> 00:11:46,359
important sensory perceptions and

308
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:48,579
sensory modalities in the consumers mind

309
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:51,669
and our breeding program and not focus

310
00:11:48,578 --> 00:11:54,549
on texture in the past we as I said were

311
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:57,610
inherently focused on aesthetics which

312
00:11:54,549 --> 00:12:00,099
is the color and the shape of the of the

313
00:11:57,610 --> 00:12:03,818
leaves and so moving forward we need to

314
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:05,800
be sure to identify if and we need to

315
00:12:03,818 --> 00:12:08,678
focus on different texture traits as

316
00:12:05,799 --> 00:12:10,808
well and then as I said we also got a

317
00:12:08,678 --> 00:12:12,909
lot of value information from the

318
00:12:10,808 --> 00:12:15,249
participants as well there's a strong

319
00:12:12,909 --> 00:12:17,649
association with health well-being and

320
00:12:15,249 --> 00:12:19,778
community and what you can do with all

321
00:12:17,649 --> 00:12:21,578
this information and this is a bit of a

322
00:12:19,778 --> 00:12:25,088
busy slide is begins to really identify

323
00:12:21,578 --> 00:12:28,138
a value diagram and kind of understand

324
00:12:25,089 --> 00:12:31,449
how what we do is plant breeders affects

325
00:12:28,139 --> 00:12:33,610
larger core values in the consumer level

326
00:12:31,448 --> 00:12:37,149
so we might adjust the texture component

327
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:40,480
whether that be the fibers fibrous myths

328
00:12:37,149 --> 00:12:42,578
of a leaf but if we do so that must also

329
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:45,449
translate throughout the consumers

330
00:12:42,578 --> 00:12:48,938
interaction with this kale type and so

331
00:12:45,448 --> 00:12:51,099
it is important to keep this in mind and

332
00:12:48,938 --> 00:12:54,818
important to inherently understand that

333
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:57,548
we can very much by making a menu and

334
00:12:54,818 --> 00:13:00,039
semi small change to a leaf type affect

335
00:12:57,548 --> 00:13:04,139
the ultimate identity and identification

336
00:13:00,039 --> 00:13:06,818
of this product with a consumer as well

337
00:13:04,139 --> 00:13:09,308
so moving forward I would say that qma

338
00:13:06,818 --> 00:13:10,928
was really successful in in doing what

339
00:13:09,308 --> 00:13:13,088
Amy Harmon called for which was could to

340
00:13:10,928 --> 00:13:15,789
create an empathetic discussion with

341
00:13:13,089 --> 00:13:18,519
consumers I wouldn't say that it was

342
00:13:15,789 --> 00:13:20,019
necessarily the easiest methodology for

343
00:13:18,519 --> 00:13:21,850
a plant breeder to engage with and I

344
00:13:20,019 --> 00:13:23,139
think that we need to explore other new

345
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:26,230
methodologies to

346
00:13:23,139 --> 00:13:28,088
but it was a start at least and then so

347
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:30,879
I'm going to continue to work with a

348
00:13:28,089 --> 00:13:34,480
sensory evaluation center as I as I said

349
00:13:30,879 --> 00:13:37,778
qma was a hypothesis generating platform

350
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:39,250
and we have a lot more to work with so

351
00:13:37,778 --> 00:13:40,600
we're going to validate a lot of what we

352
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:43,629
saw in the focus group with an online

353
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:46,180
survey validated in-house over in the

354
00:13:43,629 --> 00:13:48,490
food sensory evaluation center develop

355
00:13:46,179 --> 00:13:51,370
lab protocols to develop to measure

356
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:53,169
texture quantitatively we're also in the

357
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:55,389
process of forming a descriptive panel

358
00:13:53,169 --> 00:13:58,479
that we can go to with our breeding

359
00:13:55,389 --> 00:14:00,610
lines to really evaluate some of these

360
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,620
sensory modalities on a consistent basis

361
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:04,810
and then we're also in the process of

362
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:06,399
developing a consumer kale sensory

363
00:14:04,809 --> 00:14:08,109
descriptor wheel which will be really

364
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:11,019
interesting to run through our breeding

365
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:13,240
program as well all of this in the hopes

366
00:14:11,019 --> 00:14:15,159
of continuing to support and integrative

367
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:16,839
plant breeding program and really

368
00:14:15,159 --> 00:14:18,519
getting one step closer to connecting

369
00:14:16,839 --> 00:14:22,060
plant breeders and consumers in the

370
00:14:18,519 --> 00:14:25,509
future with that is one thing Kalina and

371
00:14:22,059 --> 00:14:28,149
my advisor Phil Rufus for all their

372
00:14:25,509 --> 00:14:29,470
support throughout this and I'm happy to

373
00:14:28,149 --> 00:14:33,000
take any questions that you might have

374
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:39,710
or talk to you after you like

375
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:39,710
[Applause]

376
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:47,159
yeah so that's what we're working on so

377
00:14:45,210 --> 00:14:49,950
I've got a summer scholar that uh will

378
00:14:47,159 --> 00:14:51,569
be coming and that is hopefully what she

379
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:54,450
will be working on in conjunction with

380
00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:57,480
the descriptive panel so you can set up

381
00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:59,190
a descriptive panel who will be really

382
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:01,440
trained in identifying different

383
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:03,900
textural properties so you can rate a VP

384
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:05,190
type from a detector of a peanut-brittle

385
00:15:03,899 --> 00:15:07,559
to peanut butter

386
00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:09,390
basically but we want to validate that

387
00:15:07,559 --> 00:15:11,429
in the lab using a penetrometer or

388
00:15:09,389 --> 00:15:13,110
something else and so that's what we're

389
00:15:11,429 --> 00:15:24,269
going to try to work on and see what's

390
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:27,029
the best best protocol so what is work

391
00:15:24,269 --> 00:15:29,309
we couldn't have done this if we had a

392
00:15:27,029 --> 00:15:32,250
panel that didn't like kale we wouldn't

393
00:15:29,309 --> 00:15:34,259
any information out of them basically so

394
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:37,230
it was like it was fundamental that we

395
00:15:34,259 --> 00:15:39,600
had to have a group of panelists that

396
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:42,420
consumed liked and consumed kale in the

397
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:44,850
first place however that's the ultimate

398
00:15:42,419 --> 00:15:47,579
goal is to address the population that

399
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:50,430
doesn't like your product right and so

400
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:52,590
in the future when we introduce new

401
00:15:50,429 --> 00:15:55,620
products we will have already have the

402
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:57,360
sensory modalities identified and

403
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:58,889
described for those different weave

404
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:01,050
types so once we give it to them we can

405
00:15:58,889 --> 00:16:05,370
identify what has changed about those

406
00:16:01,049 --> 00:16:06,599
lead types and if that affects the

407
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:09,009
perception from the people who don't

408
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:26,409
like it if that makes sense yeah

409
00:16:09,009 --> 00:16:40,889
oh my bargain but specifically because

410
00:16:26,409 --> 00:16:43,839
of congestion

411
00:16:40,889 --> 00:16:45,789
so as far as I know the secondary

412
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:47,800
metabolites are relatively similar I

413
00:16:45,789 --> 00:16:52,719
mean it's the same species as cabbage

414
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:55,449
and broccoli and cauliflower I don't I

415
00:16:52,720 --> 00:17:01,290
don't know the answer what was animal

416
00:16:55,450 --> 00:17:01,290
you could a medical excuse

417
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:12,430
I should include them all started

418
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:16,170
Medical subscription channel okay yeah

419
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:16,170
that'd be great that would be great

00:17:18,838 --> 00:17:27,659
