1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,000
This is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:06,160
University.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,080
Welcome to the show. Uh we, as you can

4
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:10,400
see, we've got a couple of Cornell

5
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:12,000
folks, uh bunch of Cornell folks today.

6
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,839
Kyle Wickings, our soil insect

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,519
ecologist. Kyle will talk to us in a

8
00:00:13,839 --> 00:00:19,039
minute. Um this is May, so we're gonna,

9
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:23,920
you know, we're going to get into this,

10
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:26,240
but um I want to say this is the insect

11
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:27,840
mashup show, Carl, for the podcast

12
00:00:26,239 --> 00:00:30,719
listeners and the people who watch the

13
00:00:27,839 --> 00:00:33,119
video. Everything you see here we are

14
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:36,640
going to talk about. So we are going to

15
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:38,159
get an hour's worth of information into

16
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,960
30 minutes. You're going to have to play

17
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:42,878
this on half speed to be able to keep

18
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:45,679
up. But of course we'll start with a

19
00:00:42,878 --> 00:00:48,878
good dog picture. Uh Miranda Robin

20
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:50,640
Robinson and uh Dakota who made quite a

21
00:00:48,878 --> 00:00:52,960
splash at the Mitsubishi Electric

22
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:56,558
Classic. This was a Champions Tour event

23
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:58,480
down over at TPC Sugarloaf. Um, so it

24
00:00:56,558 --> 00:01:00,079
looked like that dog was uh playing

25
00:00:58,479 --> 00:01:02,479
around with everybody, walking around,

26
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:05,118
had a pass. Love when the dogs get

27
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:06,879
profile. And of course, M. Casey putting

28
00:01:05,118 --> 00:01:08,959
barley to work, cutting cups. I know

29
00:01:06,879 --> 00:01:11,118
what it feels like. I cut 18 the other

30
00:01:08,959 --> 00:01:13,839
day for the turf grass class. This is

31
00:01:11,118 --> 00:01:15,760
out in Seven Canyons in Arizona. I've

32
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,880
been thinking a lot about automation a

33
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:18,159
lot, and we're going to touch it,

34
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:19,759
believe it or not, Kyle. I'm going to

35
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:22,000
put you on the spot a little bit to ask

36
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:24,239
you to speculate, but we start

37
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,719
continuing to see every time you look up

38
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:29,359
this week, the LPGA is playing out in

39
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:32,400
Ivans, Utah, the outside of St.

40
00:01:29,359 --> 00:01:34,478
George's, and it's all mowed by these

41
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,799
automated mowers. This is the Black

42
00:01:34,478 --> 00:01:39,118
Desert Classic, uh, down there in the

43
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:40,880
high desert of southern Utah. And then

44
00:01:39,118 --> 00:01:42,879
on the left, something simple that again

45
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:45,519
I would have appreciated this week, not

46
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:48,798
having to cut 18 cups is getting a

47
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:50,879
DeWalt drill on this automated cup

48
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:53,040
cutter. Very Kyle, you got to look into

49
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:54,959
this for grub sampling, brother. Think

50
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,520
of all the years you've broken your back

51
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:59,679
just trying to break in to this thing.

52
00:01:57,519 --> 00:02:02,478
Looks like it's mounted on a skateboard.

53
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:04,159
Yeah, it's it's on a nice metal pallet

54
00:02:02,478 --> 00:02:06,959
because, you know, you just turn the

55
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:09,039
drill on and you push it down and it

56
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:11,919
works. Who knows? Anyway, like an augur,

57
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:14,238
huh? Above normal temperatures. We had a

58
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:17,119
warm week, right? Some places almost 12

59
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:19,680
degrees uh above normal. So, obviously

60
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:21,520
the season moved along quite a bit.

61
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,280
Soils are coming along with it. You're

62
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,840
in the New York metro area. You're

63
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:29,360
getting close to a lot of your soil

64
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:31,598
fungicide drenches for uh soil pathogen

65
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:34,160
problems. You're getting, you know, near

66
00:02:31,598 --> 00:02:36,639
that. Certainly down. you're you're at

67
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:38,318
that at Philly and likely near that in

68
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:40,318
the New York metropolitan area. And

69
00:02:38,318 --> 00:02:42,799
Carl, with that, we're starting to see

70
00:02:40,318 --> 00:02:44,958
the real first spike where we're seeing

71
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,719
some growth. Um, let me ask you, how are

72
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:49,360
the plots going? How many times have you

73
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:51,199
mowed so far this year? So, so we just

74
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,800
put the first mow on tall fescue. And

75
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:55,839
this is one of the interesting things.

76
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:58,560
The the tall fescue is is slower to

77
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:00,080
green up and to start growing than the

78
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,158
adjacent pennial ryrass. I mean, the

79
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:04,080
ryrass has been probably for a week and

80
00:03:02,158 --> 00:03:05,919
a half now. it's it's ready and and

81
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,840
going, but the tall fescue lags behind.

82
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:09,759
So, this model, you know, probably

83
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,680
reflects more that the tall fescue

84
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:14,239
growth sort of slow, maybe even like

85
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:16,319
bluegrass, Kentucky bluegrass, too. Um

86
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:18,400
whereas the the ryrass is probably in

87
00:03:16,318 --> 00:03:20,158
that moderate getting close to high.

88
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,840
Okay. Right about now. Yeah. Perfect.

89
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:23,759
And that's why we like ryrass for

90
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,920
hightra areas in the spring. It's

91
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:29,039
exactly what you want uh this time of

92
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:31,359
year. Um it's been a little drier along

93
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:33,439
the southern coast down in Delm Marva,

94
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:35,680
Philly. Uh they're certainly had a

95
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:38,000
deficit the last week, but that's going

96
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:39,360
away. I think everybody's going to get a

97
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,519
little bit of moisture. We're going to

98
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:43,519
get quite a bit of moisture. And I

99
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:45,360
picked up on the dollar spot risk

100
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:48,000
estimate going up, right? Very

101
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,599
interesting little blip there. I was

102
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,840
waiting for this to happen. You know,

103
00:03:49,598 --> 00:03:54,079
you got all this moisture in the system

104
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:56,319
now and you just waiting for a little

105
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:58,959
warm weather to kick it from pink snow

106
00:03:56,318 --> 00:04:01,438
mold into dollar spot world. And so I

107
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:04,799
think this is a good time to start to

108
00:04:01,438 --> 00:04:08,479
see if you can wait, right? It does this

109
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:10,480
model, you know, click in and say go now

110
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:13,598
because right now, right, Carl, you can

111
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:15,438
save sprays by holding off that first

112
00:04:13,598 --> 00:04:17,519
spray at the and it looks like it's

113
00:04:15,438 --> 00:04:20,000
going to be cool and wet moving forward.

114
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:22,720
So we're going to maybe grow out of it.

115
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,240
It might be some pressure. Uh but it is

116
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,479
something to consider when you think

117
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:29,280
about the M model. Thoughts on this,

118
00:04:26,478 --> 00:04:31,120
Carl? Yeah, I think the the forecasting

119
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:33,039
element is really interesting here. You

120
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,478
see this increase in the slope of the

121
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,879
line, whether it's our model or the

122
00:04:34,478 --> 00:04:38,719
Smith Karns. Yeah. And that's related to

123
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:41,279
sort of outbreaks. But if you see that

124
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,800
slope go up and then 3 days out, four

125
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:45,119
days out, it's cooling off and it's

126
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,800
coming back down. That's where I go

127
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,918
maybe, maybe we can be a little bit

128
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,319
That's not what we're seeing here,

129
00:04:47,918 --> 00:04:52,079
though. No. And we're seeing that 7-day

130
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:54,000
average, that green line is steadily

131
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:56,240
growing up. So, I see that and I go,

132
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,759
probably not time to risk it in this

133
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:00,000
case. you got the high value turf you

134
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:02,400
want. So again, again, you know, we use

135
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,319
these a lot of times for the large area

136
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:06,799
applications, your fairways and things

137
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:09,120
like that. It's weed control time and

138
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:11,038
you can see the ideal conditions are

139
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:15,199
starting to build there. This is uh a

140
00:05:11,038 --> 00:05:16,719
few days from now in in uh May 6. So you

141
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:19,120
can see up the Hudson Valley and

142
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:21,199
certainly most of south of the

143
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:23,280
Pennsylvania border with New York is

144
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:24,879
good to go on controlling these things.

145
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:28,159
And we're starting to see the

146
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:31,600
pollinators uh risk go up as well, Carl.

147
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:33,680
So, um here's the setup for you. Uh it

148
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:36,240
it it's that time of year where the lawn

149
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:38,879
is naturally flowering. We've got a guy

150
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:42,639
uh our pollinator expert here. I want to

151
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:44,959
do a quick hit on the no since it's mo

152
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:46,560
too. Yeah. And and we've talked about

153
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:48,799
this a couple years now, Frank, but the

154
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:51,199
idea is that we want to promote uh

155
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:53,280
beneficial habitat with this no M. Let

156
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:56,639
the grass grow, let everything flower.

157
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:58,239
Um, and I asked the the uh the AI I use,

158
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:02,079
hey, draw me a picture of what the

159
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:03,680
public perceives are the benefits of nom

160
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:05,918
versus a traditional lawn. And for those

161
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:08,319
not watching, there's uh we got the

162
00:06:05,918 --> 00:06:09,839
flowers, sunflowers, a bunch of

163
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:11,919
different stuff in there. Butterflies,

164
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:14,239
bees on top, there's earthworms, there's

165
00:06:11,918 --> 00:06:15,758
a bunch of stuff in the soil, too. And

166
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,600
in the traditional yard, there's a

167
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:19,520
couple ants running. Ants and worms.

168
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,600
Ants and worms. Worm. And there's a

169
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:23,038
worm. And and Kyle, you've done some

170
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,879
research on this. Everybody thinks about

171
00:06:23,038 --> 00:06:26,959
the above ground insects, the

172
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:29,279
butterflies and the pollinators, but

173
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:31,519
you've looked at the below ground soil

174
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:33,519
biota. What's running around in there?

175
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:36,159
When you've looked at plots like a Nom

176
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:37,599
plot and a traditional yard, is this the

177
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,439
kind of thing you see or do you see

178
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:42,080
something different?

179
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:43,399
Yeah, it's actually the So far, it's the

180
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:45,758
exact

181
00:06:43,399 --> 00:06:47,599
opposite. I mean, I don't obviously

182
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:49,038
we're looking at a traditional yard. The

183
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:51,439
yards we're looking at are really meant

184
00:06:49,038 --> 00:06:53,839
to be similar to like a larger upstate

185
00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:55,519
New York lawn, an acre or more. So

186
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:58,318
really, there's no inputs going into the

187
00:06:55,519 --> 00:07:00,159
research plots we're working with other

188
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:01,919
than mowing. And we're looking at

189
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,919
everything from weekly mowing all the

190
00:07:01,918 --> 00:07:06,879
way to an annual mow that happens in

191
00:07:03,918 --> 00:07:08,799
fall, including no mo is one of our our

192
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:11,360
treatments. So, but comparing like a

193
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,720
weekly versus no mo, they don't really

194
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:15,520
look like this. In fact, it's kind of

195
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:16,720
the opposite. So, uh, there's a lot more

196
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:18,159
smaller critters that aren't shown on

197
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,919
here that we're kind of focusing on like

198
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,639
springtails, mites, and things like

199
00:07:19,918 --> 00:07:24,318
that. Below ground. Below ground, right?

200
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:26,720
Because the focus, right, Carl, is on

201
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:29,520
the pollinators uh, above ground.

202
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,960
Comments on that, Kyle. Um, you know,

203
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:33,519
we're going to cover this a little bit,

204
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:36,079
but I want to get your two cents on not

205
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:38,240
mowing for the month as a way of

206
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:40,399
servicing pollinators.

207
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:42,639
Yeah. I so we got we've got data

208
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:44,879
flowering data presence absence of

209
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:48,000
flowering pre-post mowing and we've also

210
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:49,519
got some data on uh flower density like

211
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,839
five times throughout the season for the

212
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:54,000
last two years and you do get a spike in

213
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:56,638
May when you do that but what happens

214
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,639
after that is some of those nom plots

215
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:01,439
end up having less flowering than all

216
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:03,199
the other treatments do okay there's

217
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:05,120
some backfiring going on in the plan I

218
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:07,520
guess you know okay so you so so there

219
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:09,280
is some evidence that by not mowing for

220
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:11,038
a little

221
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:13,038
there is a benefit and that's just

222
00:08:11,038 --> 00:08:15,279
probably a disturbance of the canopy

223
00:08:13,038 --> 00:08:18,800
stuff as well, right? They start to make

224
00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:21,679
it a habitat as as well as a uh as well

225
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:23,598
as just a place where they feed

226
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:25,519
in the above ground stuff. Yeah, I think

227
00:08:23,598 --> 00:08:27,360
so. And we do see it show up in the

228
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:29,918
flowering presence that's there, but you

229
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:31,439
know, we see it also in if you uh mow

230
00:08:29,918 --> 00:08:33,918
every two weeks. So it's it's not

231
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:35,918
necessarily it's just a a full month of

232
00:08:33,918 --> 00:08:37,598
holding off on mowing. But yeah, it's

233
00:08:35,918 --> 00:08:40,000
really what happens after that for the

234
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:42,640
remaining months where Nomay starts to

235
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,200
look kind of raggedy. So Okay. All

236
00:08:42,639 --> 00:08:48,240
right. And and look raggedy also by by

237
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:49,680
not flowering and continually flowering

238
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,200
throughout the year, right? I mean when

239
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:53,359
we think about pollinators, we think

240
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:55,519
about that consistency of feed

241
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:57,278
throughout the season, right? Yeah.

242
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:59,919
Yeah. And I mean I think the idea when

243
00:08:57,278 --> 00:09:01,600
this came about Nomo May in Europe, it

244
00:08:59,919 --> 00:09:03,039
was well this is a window of time when

245
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,200
you need to provide those pollen

246
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:07,120
resources, right? I don't think that's

247
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:09,040
necessarily the month you would need it

248
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,080
everywhere. But uh that was the idea.

249
00:09:09,039 --> 00:09:11,519
You know, we don't necessarily need

250
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,800
flowers later. You need it to line up

251
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:14,720
with when pollinators need those

252
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:16,799
resources coming out of overwintering

253
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,639
and spring. So that's really the idea,

254
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:20,639
but it just seems so sight specific

255
00:09:18,639 --> 00:09:23,360
depending on what flowering plants you

256
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:25,039
actually have uh in the system. And you

257
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,720
know for us it's like bindweed and a

258
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:29,360
whole bunch of other problematic things.

259
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:31,839
So you know the other part of this is

260
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:34,240
the social aspect of it right this sort

261
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:37,240
of touches on your sort of view of the

262
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:39,600
lawn. Uh and people will consider it

263
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:41,919
ethical. Some people will judge other

264
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:44,240
people who don't cut their grass. Uh

265
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:46,879
there's a whole lot of sociological

266
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:48,959
things that I'm sure if I went anywhere

267
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:51,600
near social media, you could stir it

268
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:54,319
right up uh if you wanted to with this

269
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:56,800
particular topic. All right. So, so um

270
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:59,680
we also, you know, this tool, right,

271
00:09:56,799 --> 00:10:01,919
that I passed over about this really

272
00:09:59,679 --> 00:10:05,039
just follows a couple of the common

273
00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:07,199
flowering weeds in the lawn. And and it

274
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:09,519
really is something you tend to think

275
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,600
about more in the spring because we

276
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:13,360
apply so many things in the spring,

277
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:16,159
right? We apply our pre-emergent, you

278
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:18,560
apply your early grub control, you apply

279
00:10:16,159 --> 00:10:20,639
your fertilizer, you apply your

280
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:22,958
broadleaf, we I mean you you're making

281
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:25,679
on a lawn, you're potentially making

282
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:28,719
four applications of products to at a

283
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:30,719
time when the lawn will be likely

284
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,959
flowering. So that creates an issue. The

285
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:35,440
other issue is with rainfall coming,

286
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:37,679
man, the dumps with the heat feels like

287
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:39,920
we're getting dumped on. This is our

288
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:42,479
runoff model looking at the next bunch

289
00:10:39,919 --> 00:10:46,639
of days. And there's definitely a window

290
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:48,000
in there from the 4th to the to the 7th

291
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:51,120
where you don't really want to be

292
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,200
applying. And statewide on the 6th

293
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:55,679
except for the northern reaches of the

294
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:57,360
state, right? This puts us to let me

295
00:10:55,679 --> 00:10:59,519
look at my calendar. The six this puts

296
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:01,200
us into Tuesday. you know, Monday,

297
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:02,799
Tuesday, you really, you know, you're

298
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:05,120
starting your week as a landscaping

299
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:06,879
crew. You want to be very careful if

300
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:09,600
you're going out there in these regions

301
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:12,000
where the runoff risk is high. Now,

302
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:14,639
remember, this is a model, right, Carl?

303
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,240
It's mostly wrong, but sometimes useful,

304
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:18,879
right? It's always wrong, sometimes

305
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:21,680
useful. Always wrong, sometimes useful.

306
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:24,240
But how would you internalize this if

307
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:27,519
you had a spray on this day in the areas

308
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:30,000
where it was red? Yeah, I I for sure

309
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:32,159
high slope areas near water bodies when

310
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,919
when we see red consistently for several

311
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:36,639
days and when you look at just a weather

312
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:38,958
forecast on weather.com or whatever,

313
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:40,958
man, it's not going to be good to to

314
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:42,879
spray. You're going to lose not only

315
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:44,879
that running off into water bodies and

316
00:11:42,879 --> 00:11:47,120
causing, you know, water quality issues,

317
00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:48,159
but just effectiveness of the spray.

318
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,480
Like if you're going to go out and treat

319
00:11:48,159 --> 00:11:51,838
for ABW adults or something and it's

320
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:54,959
raining and that material is going to

321
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:57,600
move, man, is it better to get maybe

322
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:59,439
little worse timing and leave the

323
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:02,240
product there where it's supposed to go.

324
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:04,240
Yeah. Or I got to if Monday's my spray

325
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:06,159
day, I got to spray on Monday. Kyle,

326
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:08,159
from your perspective with, you know,

327
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:09,360
maybe the first ABW adult treatment

328
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:11,679
we're going to get into here a little

329
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:14,000
bit, what would your thoughts be on,

330
00:12:11,679 --> 00:12:15,679
man, I see peak adult activity, but it's

331
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,919
gonna rain, you know, should I put that

332
00:12:15,679 --> 00:12:19,439
out? Yeah, that honestly that is exactly

333
00:12:17,919 --> 00:12:22,000
what we're dealing with. I've put off an

334
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:24,160
adulticide application for a trial twice

335
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,480
now because of that. Like we're just

336
00:12:24,159 --> 00:12:28,399
playing leapfrog in between rain showers

337
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:30,320
and you know those adulticides, they've

338
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:32,879
got to stay dry for like at least 12

339
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:35,278
hours. So if you can't find a 12-h hour

340
00:12:32,879 --> 00:12:38,078
window, uh you could be washing it off

341
00:12:35,278 --> 00:12:39,360
where it needs to be. So uh that's

342
00:12:38,078 --> 00:12:40,159
exactly what we're dealing with. And

343
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,519
I've talked to a number of

344
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:43,278
superintendents who are like, man, I

345
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:44,560
don't know if I should wait longer. You

346
00:12:43,278 --> 00:12:45,919
know, they're already delaying it a

347
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:47,278
little bit. And you know, a little bit

348
00:12:45,919 --> 00:12:48,639
later is better than a little bit early

349
00:12:47,278 --> 00:12:50,559
with these adult signs if you're going

350
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:52,560
to do them, but trying to be surgical

351
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:54,399
with them is so much harder when you've

352
00:12:52,559 --> 00:12:56,319
got chance of rain throughout the day.

353
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:58,078
So, this is great. I wasn't even

354
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:00,160
expecting this and that and that's good.

355
00:12:58,078 --> 00:13:02,559
Now, Kyle, here's the first quick hit

356
00:13:00,159 --> 00:13:05,120
for you. This came up the other day when

357
00:13:02,559 --> 00:13:08,638
we were out at Delhigh. Uh, somebody

358
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:11,519
said, "Hey, can I use my Roomba mower,

359
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:14,799
my autonomous mower to deal with

360
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:16,399
earthworm castings?" What say you?

361
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:18,240
Interesting. I've never seen them drive

362
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:21,600
over earthworm casts before. I'd like to

363
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:23,600
see that. I mean, they mow 24 hours a

364
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:28,000
day. I mean, they basically say, what

365
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:30,240
did he say, Carl? Uh, 12 on. No, no. 16

366
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,639
on, eight off. Yeah. Something something

367
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:34,879
like that. And And I'm I'm curious about

368
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:36,799
the the mechanism of the blade. It's a

369
00:13:34,879 --> 00:13:38,799
razor blade. It's not smashing like a

370
00:13:36,799 --> 00:13:40,958
real mower where you're sort of getting

371
00:13:38,799 --> 00:13:43,599
the castings in between the reel and the

372
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:45,039
bed knife. It's just a razor blade. And

373
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:48,079
when we looked at the fairway over there

374
00:13:45,039 --> 00:13:49,838
at Delhigh, we don't see the smearing

375
00:13:48,078 --> 00:13:52,159
that you get with the real mower on the

376
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:54,800
fairways. And sort of and Steve Kurt at

377
00:13:52,159 --> 00:13:57,360
Tesarora was like, man, that that might

378
00:13:54,799 --> 00:13:59,519
be something useful. Um, and I tell you,

379
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:01,199
Carl, nobody's I'm I'm sure somebody's

380
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:02,959
thought of this. It can't be Steve and a

381
00:14:01,198 --> 00:14:05,039
bunch of us standing out of Delhigh

382
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:07,359
coming up with this idea. But I got to

383
00:14:05,039 --> 00:14:10,399
tell you to a certain extent. I'm I'm

384
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:12,879
just I just want put a little brush. Put

385
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:15,919
like four or five little things just to

386
00:14:12,879 --> 00:14:19,000
go. All you got to do is knock it down

387
00:14:15,919 --> 00:14:22,958
cuz I think there was consensus that the

388
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:25,039
blades will wear quicker if they're

389
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:27,119
hitting. I mean, these things are really

390
00:14:25,039 --> 00:14:29,278
like old. You got to be old time to

391
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:31,519
remember the old Wilkinson double-edged

392
00:14:29,278 --> 00:14:33,519
razor blades, right? That our fathers

393
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:35,360
and grandfathers probably shaved with,

394
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:37,600
right? That's what these things cut the

395
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:40,000
grass with. So, Kyle, here's our that's

396
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:42,079
our research idea uh for next year.

397
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,078
We'll start we'll start laying it out uh

398
00:14:42,078 --> 00:14:47,599
right now because we have plenty of

399
00:14:44,078 --> 00:14:50,399
areas that have worms and these are like

400
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:52,000
reliable solutions that solve a lot of

401
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:54,159
it. You don't have to have them on every

402
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,159
fairway. you just have them on the

403
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:59,360
fairways that uh where you have these

404
00:14:56,159 --> 00:15:02,480
problems. All right, where are we on the

405
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:04,480
progress of preventing this vertebrate

406
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:07,039
damage, right? I let's you know,

407
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:09,920
everybody's talking to me about grubs.

408
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:12,240
I, you know, every place I cut in, even

409
00:15:09,919 --> 00:15:14,078
if it's not peeled back, I see a soil

410
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,839
insect. So, I know there's grubs

411
00:15:14,078 --> 00:15:17,599
everywhere, Kyle. I mean, my sense is

412
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:19,920
there's just grubs everywhere. The

413
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:21,759
populations have been pretty good, but I

414
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:24,719
don't have any trouble with those little

415
00:15:21,759 --> 00:15:27,120
buggers. until these guys come along.

416
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,879
Where are we at with solving this? Are

417
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,799
we thinking about playing Led Zeppelin

418
00:15:28,879 --> 00:15:33,600
Stairway to Heaven like it was suggested

419
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:35,519
many years ago? Where are we at? Well,

420
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,199
we still want to try that, but

421
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:39,839
everything we've tried so far with it,

422
00:15:37,198 --> 00:15:41,838
it the the skunks and raccoons just

423
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:43,360
haven't played ball with us. They uh

424
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:44,959
don't show up for the concert and they

425
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,720
go elsewhere. So, that's that's been the

426
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:49,518
problem. But yeah, trying to use

427
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:52,079
something like soil vibration sound

428
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:54,560
itself or some kind of a deterrent or

429
00:15:52,078 --> 00:15:56,719
mask on on these populations of white

430
00:15:54,559 --> 00:15:58,879
grubs has been what we we've been trying

431
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:01,120
to get at. But yeah, getting a captive

432
00:15:58,879 --> 00:16:03,039
population that wants to behave and and

433
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:05,919
take part in your trial has been the

434
00:16:03,039 --> 00:16:07,278
main issue. Yeah, it's it's like human

435
00:16:05,919 --> 00:16:08,559
subjects. It's like you got to go

436
00:16:07,278 --> 00:16:09,919
through a whole bunch of stuff because,

437
00:16:08,559 --> 00:16:11,919
you know, you got to treat the animals

438
00:16:09,919 --> 00:16:13,919
right. All right, Car Carl, here we are.

439
00:16:11,919 --> 00:16:15,519
We're to ABW.

440
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:16,719
Yeah. So, so Kyle, Kyle and I were

441
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:18,639
talking a little bit before we got on,

442
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:20,879
Frank, about um you know, when we look

443
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:23,600
at the the degree day triggers or the

444
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:26,000
phenological indicators for when is peak

445
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,959
adult activity and and for those who who

446
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,198
maybe don't know what we're talking

447
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:31,119
about here, annual bluegrass weevil sort

448
00:16:29,198 --> 00:16:32,479
of the almost the best time to get them

449
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,839
when they're all sort of synchronous in

450
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:36,240
their population is when they come out

451
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:38,079
of overwintering and adults are moving

452
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,759
around. Some move early, some move late,

453
00:16:38,078 --> 00:16:42,078
but there's sort of a curve that looks

454
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:44,320
like what I got here. Sort of a sigma a

455
00:16:42,078 --> 00:16:47,039
sign curve here. there's some peak and

456
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:48,639
usually we think 110 120 grown degree

457
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:51,519
days or half green half golden for

458
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:53,320
Cynthia is when they hit that peak uh

459
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:55,839
and when I looked at the data just

460
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:58,000
yesterday oh man it's about going to be

461
00:16:55,839 --> 00:17:00,480
about 110 degree days here in Ithaca

462
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,600
today uh I see half green half gold

463
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:03,199
there in the forynthia and then I

464
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:05,199
checked this morning on weevil track

465
00:17:03,198 --> 00:17:07,038
which is a conglomerate of a bunch of

466
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:09,839
research like researchers like Kyle

467
00:17:07,038 --> 00:17:11,679
taking scouting data and Kyle just says

468
00:17:09,838 --> 00:17:14,159
hey it's it's stage one peak adult

469
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:15,839
activity in Corning So Kyle, all of

470
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:18,558
these things are lining up. The degree

471
00:17:15,838 --> 00:17:21,759
days, the the phenological, you see it

472
00:17:18,558 --> 00:17:23,519
out there. Um, so right now on paper it

473
00:17:21,759 --> 00:17:26,640
looks like, hey, everything's just a a

474
00:17:23,519 --> 00:17:28,318
standard typical traditional year. Is

475
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:30,240
that what you're seeing out when when

476
00:17:28,318 --> 00:17:33,038
you guys are doing your sampling at at a

477
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:35,038
variety of courses? Yeah, we've mostly

478
00:17:33,038 --> 00:17:37,200
been looking up on courses up along Lake

479
00:17:35,038 --> 00:17:39,919
Ontario and then in the southern tier.

480
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:41,360
And um it did not look like this

481
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:43,038
originally. You know, things really

482
00:17:41,359 --> 00:17:44,719
weren't lining up. We had degree days

483
00:17:43,038 --> 00:17:46,480
advancing

484
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:48,240
uh at a certain pace and we couldn't

485
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:49,679
find weevils that seemed to be the

486
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:52,558
population really didn't look like what

487
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:54,640
you'd expect. We were well past 50 uh

488
00:17:52,558 --> 00:17:56,240
degree days, closer to 90 and we were

489
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:58,000
still struggling to find adult weevils

490
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:01,279
on some courses that we knew had

491
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,960
problems with them last year. So, uh, it

492
00:18:01,279 --> 00:18:05,038
things just seem out of sync. And when

493
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:06,798
it took comes to Foryia, you know, we

494
00:18:05,038 --> 00:18:09,200
found so many FYIA this year that had

495
00:18:06,798 --> 00:18:12,240
some kind of freeze damage on them that

496
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:14,400
there's very light uh, canopy on them.

497
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:16,000
So, what flowering they had, it was

498
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,840
really hard to assess much of what was

499
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,558
going on. And that's all over the place.

500
00:18:17,839 --> 00:18:22,000
We just found really raggedy looking for

501
00:18:19,558 --> 00:18:24,480
cythia. And the ones that were had a

502
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,000
better canopy, we couldn't find a lot of

503
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,839
consistency. There were some that had

504
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,558
green already, some that, you know, full

505
00:18:27,839 --> 00:18:32,000
gold looked kind of questionable. So,

506
00:18:30,558 --> 00:18:34,079
that didn't seem to line up that well

507
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,480
either. But, I'd say starting tail end

508
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:39,199
of last week, we last week is about when

509
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:40,798
we hit 110 to 120 like you've got here,

510
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:43,759
Carl, for most of the courses we work

511
00:18:40,798 --> 00:18:46,000
on. And, uh, we started to see adult

512
00:18:43,759 --> 00:18:47,440
activities seem like it was sinking up a

513
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,599
little bit. And I'd say we're kind of at

514
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:52,798
that peak activity window in the

515
00:18:49,599 --> 00:18:54,159
Fingerlakes now. So, uh, yeah, it was

516
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:57,359
interesting. I look back through our

517
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:59,200
records and that same window happened

518
00:18:57,359 --> 00:19:02,079
the first week of May last year, too.

519
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:03,360
So, okay. As messy as things seemed

520
00:19:02,079 --> 00:19:05,038
coming out of winter, we didn't know

521
00:19:03,359 --> 00:19:06,798
what was going on and nothing seemed to

522
00:19:05,038 --> 00:19:08,879
be lining up, but it seems like it's

523
00:19:06,798 --> 00:19:10,720
maybe behaving a little better now with

524
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:13,039
the delta. It's funny, Carl, haven't we

525
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:15,839
heard Andy Wilson, our pal at director

526
00:19:13,038 --> 00:19:18,480
of aronomy at at Beth Page talk about

527
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:20,798
after all the years of keeping data,

528
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:24,558
he's basically got it nailed down to the

529
00:19:20,798 --> 00:19:26,400
same week every year. for for his laral

530
00:19:24,558 --> 00:19:27,839
his first laral application. Yes. And

531
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:30,559
that's one of the the next questions for

532
00:19:27,839 --> 00:19:32,558
you, Kyle, is we sort of best management

533
00:19:30,558 --> 00:19:34,000
practice is sort of to do the you know,

534
00:19:32,558 --> 00:19:35,918
you've called it the three-step program.

535
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,519
You do an adult early because you know

536
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:39,520
that's when they're all coming out and

537
00:19:37,519 --> 00:19:41,519
then you when when you first sort of do

538
00:19:39,519 --> 00:19:43,359
the scouting and see the larve, then you

539
00:19:41,519 --> 00:19:44,879
hit them with a larvaide. That's sort of

540
00:19:43,359 --> 00:19:46,798
the first two components. And we think

541
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:48,039
that as you go throughout the year,

542
00:19:46,798 --> 00:19:50,480
there's more

543
00:19:48,038 --> 00:19:51,839
asynchronicity in the populations. But

544
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:53,599
the Beth Pageige guys haven't done an

545
00:19:51,839 --> 00:19:55,678
adulticide for I don't know 10 years

546
00:19:53,599 --> 00:19:57,519
Frank they only well they got pythroidid

547
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:59,280
resistance and I wonder if some of that

548
00:19:57,519 --> 00:20:01,918
resistance might be gone if it's not

549
00:19:59,279 --> 00:20:04,000
worth testing it again to see if the

550
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:06,559
populations built up but yeah they have

551
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,400
been using once they got the word you

552
00:20:06,558 --> 00:20:10,558
know tournament golf course the black

553
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:12,320
course once they got the word that they

554
00:20:10,558 --> 00:20:14,879
were resistant they've moved to other

555
00:20:12,319 --> 00:20:17,918
strategies very effectively

556
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:19,360
and and Kyle you've you've looked into a

557
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:21,440
couple different treatment programs the

558
00:20:19,359 --> 00:20:24,000
last few a couple of which have no

559
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:26,000
adulticide early and just a larvaide and

560
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,919
then another one later in the year and

561
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,759
you're finding that works pretty well,

562
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:31,120
right? Maybe contrary to what we used to

563
00:20:29,759 --> 00:20:34,240
think about, hey, you got to get that

564
00:20:31,119 --> 00:20:35,839
adult adult down. Yeah. Yeah. The work

565
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:37,759
we've been doing like a lot of other

566
00:20:35,839 --> 00:20:39,279
turf entomologists and actually a lot of

567
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:42,679
other entomologists in general has been

568
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:44,558
looking at uh the new active uh

569
00:20:42,679 --> 00:20:46,400
isocycloserum the what's going to be

570
00:20:44,558 --> 00:20:47,759
plazelin from Senta. There's been a lot

571
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:50,159
of advertisement. What are they going to

572
00:20:47,759 --> 00:20:51,599
call it? Planazelin.

573
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:53,679
That's the chemical name. What are they

574
00:20:51,599 --> 00:20:55,918
going to call it? That's going to be the

575
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:57,200
product name. Oh, really? Plenaz. Oh,

576
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:59,919
that's right. We talked about this

577
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:01,200
during the state park thing. Okay. Yeah.

578
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:03,360
Yeah. They've just started advertising

579
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:05,600
it. So, it's it's uh it's kind of out

580
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:06,959
there now. But yeah, so that the attempt

581
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:08,798
there was to try and break this up into

582
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:10,759
sort of a two-stage window where you're

583
00:21:08,798 --> 00:21:12,558
not so dependent on just going after

584
00:21:10,759 --> 00:21:15,759
adulticides, you know, move away from

585
00:21:12,558 --> 00:21:18,639
that. Um I guess you know we did try

586
00:21:15,759 --> 00:21:21,038
some later stage larvicides only just

587
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:22,880
one application and it it can be

588
00:21:21,038 --> 00:21:24,558
effective. We did find that even as

589
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:26,559
surgical as we were trying to be with

590
00:21:24,558 --> 00:21:28,960
scouting and timing of everything like

591
00:21:26,558 --> 00:21:30,720
really intense scouting we still had a

592
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:33,038
little bit of dam more damage show up

593
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:35,279
with that one than we saw if we did go

594
00:21:33,038 --> 00:21:38,240
into with uh some kind of an earlier

595
00:21:35,279 --> 00:21:40,000
larvaite as well. Um but we got

596
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:41,919
significant knockdown of the weevils. So

597
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,839
I I think it really if you put all the

598
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:46,240
eggs in that later stage larvicide

599
00:21:43,839 --> 00:21:48,079
basket, it definitely does require

600
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:49,519
really careful scouting, but there's

601
00:21:48,079 --> 00:21:52,399
certainly some courses that are really

602
00:21:49,519 --> 00:21:54,240
successful at it. So yeah, the so the

603
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,679
scouting aspect is is one thing you'll

604
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:57,038
say and all the other anomologists will

605
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:58,480
say is you got to scout at your golf

606
00:21:57,038 --> 00:22:00,640
course. Each golf course is going to be

607
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:02,640
different. Understanding how many adults

608
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:04,320
when you're doing the soap flushes means

609
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:07,120
peak is like again that's different

610
00:22:04,319 --> 00:22:08,639
course by course. And when I think of of

611
00:22:07,119 --> 00:22:10,399
uh you know courses like the Cornell

612
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:12,159
golf course here, Kyle, you've been on

613
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:14,000
there. We've got different types of

614
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:15,600
overwintering sites. Some meadow areas

615
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,400
out in the middle of the open. You've

616
00:22:15,599 --> 00:22:20,399
got the woodland areas, very shady. Um

617
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:22,400
do you see superintendent who will do

618
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:25,120
scouting in these two areas and apply at

619
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:26,640
different times and and specifically out

620
00:22:25,119 --> 00:22:28,239
and say, "Hey, I gota, you know, maybe

621
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:29,679
on Monday I'm going to have to go out in

622
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:31,599
the meadow areas because it's warmer and

623
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:33,679
then maybe a week later." Do you see

624
00:22:31,599 --> 00:22:35,678
this? And is this a best practice that

625
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:37,038
you're recommending to folks? That's a

626
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:40,240
great question. We we've seen that kind

627
00:22:37,038 --> 00:22:42,558
of a stagger before. Again, it starts to

628
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:44,798
sink up a little bit over time, but and

629
00:22:42,558 --> 00:22:46,399
narrow, but we've seen a stagger like

630
00:22:44,798 --> 00:22:48,879
that where we were finding them way out

631
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:51,120
in the rough on one green around one

632
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:52,559
green and on another they they were much

633
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:54,239
closer. And I don't know if it always

634
00:22:52,558 --> 00:22:56,558
relates to how close the overwintering

635
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:58,880
site was necessarily, but we do see

636
00:22:56,558 --> 00:23:00,480
that. Um, especially if there's one a

637
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:03,520
green that's much more shaded than

638
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:05,839
another that's exposed. But, uh, again,

639
00:23:03,519 --> 00:23:07,200
back to like these really narrow windows

640
00:23:05,839 --> 00:23:08,879
of time when everybody's trying to get

641
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,558
their tank mixes together and just make

642
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:12,559
one shot in spring for these

643
00:23:10,558 --> 00:23:13,918
applications. I haven't seen anybody

644
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:15,200
consider trying to break up. They're

645
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:18,240
just trying to pick the date that would

646
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:19,759
be best for all of the spots.

647
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:21,120
uh that's what I've seen most of the

648
00:23:19,759 --> 00:23:23,119
time, but they're definitely considering

649
00:23:21,119 --> 00:23:25,759
that variability that we're seeing on

650
00:23:23,119 --> 00:23:27,439
the um I mean I only know a handful that

651
00:23:25,759 --> 00:23:29,759
actually go out and vacuum sample or do

652
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:31,519
soap flushes to try and gauge that, but

653
00:23:29,759 --> 00:23:34,319
they're aware that there's variability

654
00:23:31,519 --> 00:23:36,079
in the development uh of the adults. I

655
00:23:34,319 --> 00:23:38,319
just I just saw a paper the other day,

656
00:23:36,079 --> 00:23:40,639
Kyle, looking at comparing scouting

657
00:23:38,319 --> 00:23:42,720
methods and actually concluded

658
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:45,038
surprisingly that the soap flush was

659
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:47,038
better than the vacuum method depending

660
00:23:45,038 --> 00:23:49,440
on the height of the grass. uh that that

661
00:23:47,038 --> 00:23:51,519
I saw in that particular paper. But I

662
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:53,120
want to go back to so I think you know

663
00:23:51,519 --> 00:23:55,519
the soap flushing that we've been using

664
00:23:53,119 --> 00:23:58,239
at Beth Page for the last decade or 15

665
00:23:55,519 --> 00:24:00,558
years continues to be the easy peasy.

666
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:02,480
You got a you know two and a half gallon

667
00:24:00,558 --> 00:24:04,918
jug. You put water in it. You squirt

668
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:07,759
some lemon joy. Continues to be the the

669
00:24:04,919 --> 00:24:10,000
the surfactant soap of choice to

670
00:24:07,759 --> 00:24:12,720
irritate them. Must be something in the

671
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,319
lemon chemical that's irritating them.

672
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:16,159
Um but I want to talk about the

673
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:19,678
overwintering sites. Uh, I know you

674
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:22,240
played around with this in the past. Um,

675
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:24,159
and I know, listen, when I was when I

676
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:26,159
heard Carl say this overwintering thing,

677
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:27,278
it reminded me, and man, only the old

678
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:30,240
guys are going to know what I'm talking

679
00:24:27,278 --> 00:24:32,319
about now. Harry Nimchek, the old Ohio

680
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:34,960
State, the late Ohio State enemologist,

681
00:24:32,319 --> 00:24:38,240
used to used to recommend walking in the

682
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:40,558
woods with the granular insecticide to

683
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:43,120
kill the, you know, in the overwintering

684
00:24:40,558 --> 00:24:45,918
sites with Durban. We were probably

685
00:24:43,119 --> 00:24:48,079
buying Durban back then or dazinon or

686
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:50,000
some some chemical. But I mean that's

687
00:24:48,079 --> 00:24:52,798
where we've come from. People were so

688
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:56,880
desperate for a really long time. I mean

689
00:24:52,798 --> 00:24:59,679
Pat Vidam spent her entire career

690
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:02,159
studying this one organism, right? So

691
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:04,400
it's not like we're making it into and

692
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:06,720
Ben proclaimed last year, yeah, I'm not

693
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:09,759
even worried about this no more. Right?

694
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:12,798
So so I want to hear about the over the

695
00:25:09,759 --> 00:25:16,079
ability. Let's revisit the little bit of

696
00:25:12,798 --> 00:25:18,480
work you've played around with in in

697
00:25:16,079 --> 00:25:20,319
disrupting or messing around with o

698
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:22,880
potentially meadow areas or

699
00:25:20,319 --> 00:25:25,439
overwintering sites that then would

700
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:28,480
affect damage and population the next

701
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:30,558
year. Yeah, I'll just mention first you

702
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:34,079
Dan Peek did some good work showing how

703
00:25:30,558 --> 00:25:36,319
far on average into those natural areas

704
00:25:34,079 --> 00:25:38,000
ABW seems to overwinter and it's a

705
00:25:36,319 --> 00:25:39,759
pretty good depth in. I mean, it tapers

706
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,038
off quickly, but it would be a really

707
00:25:39,759 --> 00:25:43,759
hard amount of space to actually cover

708
00:25:42,038 --> 00:25:45,519
effectively, especially because you

709
00:25:43,759 --> 00:25:47,278
almost have to make the assumption that

710
00:25:45,519 --> 00:25:49,119
they're just kind of all along those

711
00:25:47,278 --> 00:25:51,038
natural areas. You can't just surgically

712
00:25:49,119 --> 00:25:52,399
pick the area, right? Not to mention the

713
00:25:51,038 --> 00:25:54,879
whole non-target effect side of things,

714
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:56,559
but That's exactly right. Yeah. Yeah.

715
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:58,159
But, uh, yeah, so we we played around

716
00:25:56,558 --> 00:26:00,399
with it a little bit. I was just really

717
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:02,960
curious how the way we manage,

718
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:04,960
especially grassy natural areas, how we

719
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:07,840
manage those might influence how well

720
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:09,600
the weevils overwinter. And we found you

721
00:26:07,839 --> 00:26:11,599
can't really improve their you can't

722
00:26:09,599 --> 00:26:13,199
really get better overwinter mortality

723
00:26:11,599 --> 00:26:15,199
of the weevils, but you can make it

724
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:16,720
worse. You can make them overwinter more

725
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:19,200
successfully.

726
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:20,960
And the way to do that is leave all the

727
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:22,360
residue in there, like mow it and leave

728
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:25,120
it sitting or just leave it tall

729
00:26:22,359 --> 00:26:27,839
standing. So getting that residue out of

730
00:26:25,119 --> 00:26:29,439
the natural areas makes that a lot more

731
00:26:27,839 --> 00:26:31,119
inhospitable of a habitat for the

732
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:32,880
weevils to overwinter in. So, I don't

733
00:26:31,119 --> 00:26:34,639
know how common that practice is, but

734
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:36,559
taking the residue off of it, you got a

735
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:38,480
lot more violent temperature spikes that

736
00:26:36,558 --> 00:26:41,200
happen in winter in those areas. I would

737
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:43,360
call it a best practice because if you

738
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:45,278
really are embracing those areas, you

739
00:26:43,359 --> 00:26:47,038
want them to be as thin and wispy as

740
00:26:45,278 --> 00:26:50,558
possible if there's any chance they can

741
00:26:47,038 --> 00:26:53,119
be in play. So, harvesting the plant

742
00:26:50,558 --> 00:26:55,678
material is the simplest way of mining

743
00:26:53,119 --> 00:26:57,678
the soil for the nutrients that you have

744
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:59,038
no other way of getting rid of. I mean,

745
00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:01,120
obviously don't want them to leech. Now

746
00:26:59,038 --> 00:27:03,759
listen, I want to wrap up. We got three

747
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:05,599
minutes and Alrech published this paper

748
00:27:03,759 --> 00:27:07,759
last year, Kyle, and you were talking a

749
00:27:05,599 --> 00:27:09,439
little bit about it with the state park

750
00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:13,038
guys. I want to give you a chance to

751
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:16,080
talk about th this sort of idea where

752
00:27:13,038 --> 00:27:18,400
you go out on your own golf course and

753
00:27:16,079 --> 00:27:22,798
you sample some soil and you make a

754
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:26,400
neode brew that you then apply and these

755
00:27:22,798 --> 00:27:27,759
guys have found you get persistence be

756
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:30,720
for whatever. I'm going to leave this to

757
00:27:27,759 --> 00:27:32,558
you. uh and it seems to be providing uh

758
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:35,759
some control. Can you talk a little bit

759
00:27:32,558 --> 00:27:39,038
about this? I I grabbed this uh sort of

760
00:27:35,759 --> 00:27:40,720
conglomerate image from the publication.

761
00:27:39,038 --> 00:27:42,000
Yeah. Yeah. I think it's really

762
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:43,278
interesting. I think this is something I

763
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,640
thought about a lot following up from

764
00:27:43,278 --> 00:27:48,558
Nelson Shields work in field corn and uh

765
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:50,080
wasn't doing it quite this way where

766
00:27:48,558 --> 00:27:51,839
they were more bringing it back to the

767
00:27:50,079 --> 00:27:54,240
lab and trying to sell their own

768
00:27:51,839 --> 00:27:56,319
neatodes or whatever but uh that the

769
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:58,720
idea that you can take a population on

770
00:27:56,319 --> 00:28:00,240
site rear it up and reapply it is a

771
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:02,000
really interesting one and I this was a

772
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:03,919
really cool paper so I think it shows

773
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,398
that we know that most of these golf

774
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:08,799
courses have some degree of insect

775
00:28:06,398 --> 00:28:10,398
pathogenic neatode populations on them

776
00:28:08,798 --> 00:28:11,759
so the ability to harness that and

777
00:28:10,398 --> 00:28:13,199
re-releas release them back out is

778
00:28:11,759 --> 00:28:14,640
really cool. I like how they tried it in

779
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:17,120
the fairways and in the rough, too,

780
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:19,840
because they're super different areas.

781
00:28:17,119 --> 00:28:22,239
So, um it's pretty cheap to be able to

782
00:28:19,839 --> 00:28:24,480
do like the the materials that that

783
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:26,640
Albert's showing here are pretty

784
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:28,480
inexpensive to get. It's definitely a

785
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:30,240
very different system to be able to to

786
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:32,000
dial in. We played around with this a

787
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:33,440
little bit in sod and we found depending

788
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,359
on the soil type, you can get the

789
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:38,240
nematodeses to persist pretty well even

790
00:28:35,359 --> 00:28:39,918
through sod harvest. So there's there's

791
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:42,319
some interesting science to this that I

792
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:44,399
think is uh you know this just jumped

793
00:28:42,319 --> 00:28:47,678
right out at me when you said it because

794
00:28:44,398 --> 00:28:49,759
for years um we've talked about how

795
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:51,759
almost all these properties have to have

796
00:28:49,759 --> 00:28:53,679
some suppressive effects. They're

797
00:28:51,759 --> 00:28:55,440
looking for this now in the dollar spot

798
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:57,679
world, right? Ming just published that

799
00:28:55,440 --> 00:29:01,038
paper recently on the potential for

800
00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:04,240
soils to suppress uh pathogens. you

801
00:29:01,038 --> 00:29:07,519
know, the idea that we could do this,

802
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:11,599
um, I pro I think probably scares a lot

803
00:29:07,519 --> 00:29:13,519
of companies that might, you know, all

804
00:29:11,599 --> 00:29:14,879
of a sudden not be able to do this, but

805
00:29:13,519 --> 00:29:17,599
then I'm sure they'll build an industry

806
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:19,919
on how to do this automatically at your

807
00:29:17,599 --> 00:29:22,398
property. This may be something to do

808
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:24,799
with all those hollow time C. See, I'm

809
00:29:22,398 --> 00:29:26,798
wondering why do I got to take plugs?

810
00:29:24,798 --> 00:29:29,599
Why don't I just c I got to c a damn

811
00:29:26,798 --> 00:29:31,440
thing anyway. Bring up plugs, collect

812
00:29:29,599 --> 00:29:33,599
the soil from that. Is that another way

813
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:36,399
to go here, Kyle? Is it just soil is

814
00:29:33,599 --> 00:29:38,719
soil? Bring your plugs in and use that

815
00:29:36,398 --> 00:29:40,639
to Yeah, we grow grass from it. They

816
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:41,919
generate putting greens from it. Yep.

817
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:43,919
Yeah, you can certainly collect those.

818
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:45,919
We we did that when we uh did some

819
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:47,759
verification work and brought the plugs

820
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:49,200
back. So, yeah, that that's certainly

821
00:29:47,759 --> 00:29:50,720
something you can try. Okay. I think a

822
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,759
lot of it is getting, you know, if it's

823
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:54,880
going to be something that you have

824
00:29:51,759 --> 00:29:56,480
superintendent do versus uh a service

825
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:58,080
provide like they'll collect rear and

826
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:59,519
give you your neatodes back versus

827
00:29:58,079 --> 00:30:03,278
something you can just run in your shop

828
00:29:59,519 --> 00:30:05,119
with a cheap cup of uh insect hosts and

829
00:30:03,278 --> 00:30:06,798
then make basically screen out a

830
00:30:05,119 --> 00:30:08,479
solution to spray back out would be

831
00:30:06,798 --> 00:30:10,240
really interesting. I guess where where

832
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:11,519
it needs to go next is testing that a

833
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:13,679
lot of different soil types because

834
00:30:11,519 --> 00:30:15,440
we've seen so much variability in how

835
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:18,159
well they'll persist and establish based

836
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:21,120
on soil type. I guarantee that stuff all

837
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:23,200
is thinking about too. So that really

838
00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:26,079
how it's going to work on each Okay. So

839
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:28,798
as a as a as a last as a last word and

840
00:30:26,079 --> 00:30:32,398
then we're getting out of here. Um are

841
00:30:28,798 --> 00:30:34,879
there I is it pretty much the better the

842
00:30:32,398 --> 00:30:37,599
soil, the more organic matter, the

843
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:40,559
better balance of air and water, you

844
00:30:37,599 --> 00:30:44,158
know, uh the better neatodes. Uh, and

845
00:30:40,558 --> 00:30:45,879
the worst compacted clay, you know,

846
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:48,159
dramatic soils, the worst for

847
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:49,679
nematodeses. Is that sort of easy? Like

848
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:52,640
if you got a pretty good healthy soil,

849
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:55,600
quote unquote healthy soil, nematodes

850
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:57,200
will persist. Yeah, we found that soils

851
00:30:55,599 --> 00:30:58,959
if they persisted best on our highest

852
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:00,319
organic matter soils, soils that you

853
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:02,159
amend with sand, you get a little bit

854
00:31:00,319 --> 00:31:03,918
better performance on. So, and compacted

855
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:06,559
soils, especially the work that we did

856
00:31:03,919 --> 00:31:08,559
on school athletic fields and goal

857
00:31:06,558 --> 00:31:10,639
mouths, doesn't work so well. That's

858
00:31:08,558 --> 00:31:14,240
right. where the soil's compacted. Yeah.

859
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:17,360
All right, Carl, we made it. Kyle,

860
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:20,079
the got everything covered. Look, the

861
00:31:17,359 --> 00:31:22,000
insect in insect mashup. The insect

862
00:31:20,079 --> 00:31:23,519
mashup. Yep. All right. Good to see

863
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,880
everybody. Thanks very much. Thanks,

864
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:27,278
Kyle. Take care, everybody. See you next

865
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:30,240
week. Take care, guys. This has been a

866
00:31:27,278 --> 00:31:34,038
production of Cornell University on the

867
