1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,800
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:07,639 --> 00:00:12,080
University after the initial excitement

3
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:15,080
wears off when people come by to see the

4
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:18,000
Titan arum uh I'm often

5
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:20,198
asked why do we do this why do we study

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,480
strange plants and unusual plants like

7
00:00:20,199 --> 00:00:25,439
this um in the grand scheme of things uh

8
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:28,199
does it cure disease does it help us

9
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:30,759
increase crop yield does it what is it

10
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:33,559
what is it good for um

11
00:00:30,759 --> 00:00:36,359
in my mind uh studying plants like the

12
00:00:33,558 --> 00:00:38,799
Titan arum are simply representative of

13
00:00:36,359 --> 00:00:42,920
Discovery based science

14
00:00:38,799 --> 00:00:44,159
um we don't know before we do studies

15
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:45,239
what we're going to learn that's the

16
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:48,718
essence of

17
00:00:45,238 --> 00:00:51,000
exploration and um the Titan Aram and

18
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:52,679
plants like it are another kind of

19
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,198
landscape to explore in the natural

20
00:00:52,679 --> 00:00:57,840
world part of the the the wonders of

21
00:00:55,198 --> 00:01:01,079
biological diversity uh across the

22
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:03,359
planet so but I like to give tangible

23
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:06,359
examples to people of what's interesting

24
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:08,960
and useful about Discovery based science

25
00:01:06,359 --> 00:01:12,640
um we can start with the plant itself

26
00:01:08,959 --> 00:01:14,559
it's its biology is unusual enough to

27
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:17,000
cause us to wonder you know why would

28
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,759
you create uh why would why would a

29
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,799
plant Marshall that much energy and

30
00:01:18,759 --> 00:01:23,040
devote that much of its reproductive

31
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:27,280
effort to being so large and so stinky

32
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:29,520
and so hot um for such a short amount of

33
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:31,478
time and then go several years between

34
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:35,039
reprodu Ive uh events instead of doing

35
00:01:31,478 --> 00:01:37,438
it every year like migrating birds

36
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:40,880
um and when we take a closer look at

37
00:01:37,438 --> 00:01:44,199
what the plant is doing it's attracting

38
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:47,438
flies and beetles that are decomposers

39
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:51,680
you know they their ecological niche is

40
00:01:47,438 --> 00:01:53,519
to is to use rotting materials as um as

41
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:56,920
their food for their for their young for

42
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:58,759
their for their larvea and grubs Etc um

43
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:01,439
so one hidden benefit from studying a

44
00:01:58,759 --> 00:02:04,438
plant like the Titan arum is it has been

45
00:02:01,438 --> 00:02:07,118
finely tuned by natural selection to be

46
00:02:04,438 --> 00:02:10,399
attractive to what Some Humans regard as

47
00:02:07,118 --> 00:02:13,800
pest insects okay so blowflies or screw

48
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:17,759
worms are the kinds of flies that lay um

49
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:20,000
eggs or or or larae into rotting meat or

50
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:21,799
in some cases in the case of screwworms

51
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,318
um into wounds of animals that are still

52
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:28,840
alive and so these animals are pests

53
00:02:25,318 --> 00:02:33,000
to agriculture because they um cause a

54
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:34,878
lot of damage to uh to livestock and so

55
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,400
if you look back in the really applied

56
00:02:34,878 --> 00:02:40,439
scientific literature you'll find Lucy

57
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:44,480
lure and sorm lure these are code names

58
00:02:40,439 --> 00:02:47,560
or or or trademarks for um for volatile

59
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:49,079
lures that people use to trap these

60
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:50,640
flies and keep them away from their

61
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:53,120
livestock or keep them off of their

62
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:55,079
farms and so a lot of research went into

63
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:58,000
that people had to test different

64
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:59,599
combinations of these noxious odors uh

65
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,598
and and the right ratios and the right

66
00:02:59,598 --> 00:03:03,839
sort of of barcode to attract these

67
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:06,238
flies well guess what the plants have

68
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:08,000
figured that out already you know so one

69
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:10,519
immediate benefit from studying plants

70
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,680
like this which are so so effective at

71
00:03:10,519 --> 00:03:15,640
trapping flies is that they were the

72
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:18,000
code Breakers they figured it out we

73
00:03:15,639 --> 00:03:20,439
could simply copy them this a form of

74
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,360
engineering is biomimicry right the idea

75
00:03:20,439 --> 00:03:25,079
of um where does velcro come from or the

76
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:27,640
the feet of geckos that allow them to

77
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:30,280
walk on slippery surfaces uh there are

78
00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:32,639
large Industries based on using

79
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:34,919
art artificial materials to mimic what

80
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:37,679
are very effective rses and and devices

81
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:39,559
in nature um so here's another one these

82
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,680
plants have picked the the code of

83
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:43,438
female flies and beetles and we can use

84
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,879
the same volatile compounds in the same

85
00:03:43,438 --> 00:03:47,759
ratios that they make as lures it's

86
00:03:45,878 --> 00:03:49,479
already been done okay so that's one

87
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:51,959
example very close to what the plant

88
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:54,119
does um but there's another layer of

89
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:55,719
this another level of Discovery that's

90
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:57,759
really important and that is the

91
00:03:55,719 --> 00:04:01,158
connections the hidden connections that

92
00:03:57,759 --> 00:04:03,239
we don't see coming um

93
00:04:01,158 --> 00:04:05,919
an example I like to use with my

94
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:10,158
students is to talk about modern genomic

95
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:12,000
science okay so this is a huge huge part

96
00:04:10,158 --> 00:04:14,158
of of of the of the wedding between

97
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,120
technology and science and medicine and

98
00:04:14,158 --> 00:04:18,560
health is the idea that we now have the

99
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:20,199
technology to explore genomes not only

100
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,120
the human genome but but the genomes of

101
00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:23,960
other creatures the the pathogens that

102
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:25,720
live in us the the creatures that are

103
00:04:23,959 --> 00:04:29,439
helpful to us the animals and plants

104
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:31,520
that we've domesticated Etc but that

105
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:35,038
whole whole field the whole edifice of

106
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:37,680
the science of genomics is built upon

107
00:04:35,038 --> 00:04:40,199
serendipitous discoveries okay so going

108
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:42,199
back to balbiani uh who was an

109
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:45,520
embryologist in France in the in the

110
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:47,280
19th century balbiani studied um

111
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:49,240
something that people would think was

112
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:51,758
frivolous you know the salivary

113
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:54,439
chromosomes of kind of little fly

114
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:56,360
mosquito like fly and balani was just

115
00:04:54,439 --> 00:04:58,519
curious and what balbiani discovered was

116
00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:00,759
that they have um these polyene

117
00:04:58,519 --> 00:05:04,279
chromosomes that Puff up and this was

118
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:06,639
the first way to visualize genes as

119
00:05:04,279 --> 00:05:08,478
beads on a string before better

120
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:10,360
microscopy and better genetic

121
00:05:08,478 --> 00:05:12,359
Technologies uh were developed in the

122
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:15,400
early part of the 20th century so the

123
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:17,520
the foundation of genetics as a field um

124
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:18,959
rests on this kind of frivolous

125
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:21,120
Discovery by balbiani about what

126
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:23,439
salivary gland chromosomes are and

127
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:25,319
they're in fruit flies as well as midges

128
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:28,839
and there were our first beads on a

129
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:31,000
string in genetic um Dogma but it's more

130
00:05:28,839 --> 00:05:33,679
than that um the polymerase Chain

131
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Reaction PCR this is a way of amplifying

132
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:38,160
rapidly amplifying specific DNA

133
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,478
sequences this was the invention came

134
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:42,199
out in the late 80s when I was a

135
00:05:39,478 --> 00:05:43,079
beginning student and I remember the you

136
00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:46,478
know

137
00:05:43,079 --> 00:05:50,680
how fundamentally it changed the field

138
00:05:46,478 --> 00:05:53,879
of genetics but you can't do PCR without

139
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:57,319
um Tac polymerase this is this is a an

140
00:05:53,879 --> 00:06:00,360
enzyme DNA polymerus enzyme that's taken

141
00:05:57,319 --> 00:06:03,680
from uh an extremophile of bacteria

142
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:06,199
named um thermos aquaticus that lives in

143
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:08,759
Hot Springs you know in places like

144
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:11,199
Yellowstone and so who would study that

145
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:13,479
it's frivolous to go on a boond doggle

146
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:16,199
with government money to a national park

147
00:06:13,478 --> 00:06:18,959
and scoop out bacteria from Hot Springs

148
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:21,720
except it isn't frivolous because

149
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:25,159
thermos aquaticus has to do DNA

150
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:28,160
replication in 70 or 80° Centigrade

151
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:29,919
water okay it's ridiculous ecoli doesn't

152
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:33,639
do that common bacteria can't do that

153
00:06:29,918 --> 00:06:35,639
they melt so um Carrie Mullis and the

154
00:06:33,639 --> 00:06:38,038
inventors of of PR of pmer chain

155
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:39,639
reaction realized um through a long

156
00:06:38,038 --> 00:06:42,839
series of papers that were that were

157
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:45,560
published over a decade and a half um

158
00:06:42,839 --> 00:06:49,038
that Tac polymerase was the tool they

159
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:53,800
needed to solve the problem of Rapid

160
00:06:49,038 --> 00:06:57,598
Cycling of uh DNA um um amplification

161
00:06:53,800 --> 00:07:00,199
and it doesn't stop there um nowadays to

162
00:06:57,598 --> 00:07:01,959
visualize you know

163
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:03,598
transformative genetics you need

164
00:07:01,959 --> 00:07:05,878
reporter genes and people have used all

165
00:07:03,598 --> 00:07:07,120
kinds of different reporter genes um but

166
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:09,879
the one that's really made a difference

167
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:11,959
is green fluorescent protein gfp it was

168
00:07:09,879 --> 00:07:14,000
a Nobel Prize given uh for this

169
00:07:11,959 --> 00:07:17,839
discovery a few years ago but it comes

170
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:20,598
from a jellyfish and why would you ask

171
00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:22,878
the NIH to support studies of jellyfish

172
00:07:20,598 --> 00:07:24,839
that light up in the water column at

173
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:28,400
night in the oceans that's frivolous

174
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:31,198
isn't it but it's not gfp is so

175
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:33,000
incredibly important in and useful and

176
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:36,439
science is full of those kind of

177
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:38,598
discoveries um these stinky plants that

178
00:07:36,439 --> 00:07:40,399
we're studying we don't know ahead of

179
00:07:38,598 --> 00:07:42,878
time whether it's going to give us a

180
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:44,878
really valuable tool but the way that it

181
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:47,319
coordinates turning on temperature and

182
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:49,639
scent and opening and closing and and

183
00:07:47,319 --> 00:07:52,120
its respiration which is really really

184
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:54,960
high for a plant um it's got molecular

185
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:57,319
switches it's got Nano switches in it we

186
00:07:54,959 --> 00:07:59,519
need to learn from that it could be so

187
00:07:57,319 --> 00:08:01,360
useful uh to apply what we learned from

188
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:02,959
from these very very specialized plants

189
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:07,960
to other other plants that are important

190
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:07,959
to us um in our in our in our daily

191
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:14,799
lives this has been a production of

192
