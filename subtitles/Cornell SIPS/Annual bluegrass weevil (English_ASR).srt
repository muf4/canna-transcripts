00:00:09,119 --> 00:00:12,959
hi this is frank rossi for the cornell

4
00:00:11,119 --> 00:00:15,518
turf grass video log

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:17,039
and we're starting to see right around

6
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:20,240
the middle of june as the

7
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:21,600
e.t demand and irrigation systems start

8
00:00:20,239 --> 00:00:24,000
to get challenged

9
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,240
we start to see one of our important

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,118
turfgrass pests emerging here in the

11
00:00:26,239 --> 00:00:30,320
northeast

12
00:00:27,118 --> 00:00:32,000
the annual bluegrass weevil and

13
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,679
obviously it's emerged a long time ago

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,960
as an adult and now we're starting to

15
00:00:33,679 --> 00:00:37,759
see the damage

16
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:39,840
face that we're facing from the larvae

17
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:41,679
eating their way out of the stem

18
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,600
and then chewing on the crowns of the

19
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:44,960
plant and we typically see this around

20
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,719
the periphery

21
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,320
of fairways where we have a high

22
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:49,520
percentage of annual bluegrass from

23
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:51,920
compaction

24
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:53,600
um and and that those plants start to

25
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,520
get under stress and we start to see the

26
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,719
damage and the smart turf grass managers

27
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,559
are actively

28
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:00,399
if they are starting to see this damage

29
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:03,119
they're actively seeding into it

30
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:04,478
to try to mask the damage obviously

31
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:06,719
we're still struggling with trying to

32
00:01:04,478 --> 00:01:08,400
find ideal timings and ideal products

33
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:10,560
for application timing

34
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,000
for this particular pest but the annual

35
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,478
bluegrass weevil remains one

36
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
of our important and difficult pests to

37
00:01:14,478 --> 00:01:18,400
manage here in the northeast

38
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,159
and the damage can be severe around the

39
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:23,200
perimeter of fairways

40
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:24,640
and surrounds of putting greens thank

41
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,320
you for joining me for the cornell turf
