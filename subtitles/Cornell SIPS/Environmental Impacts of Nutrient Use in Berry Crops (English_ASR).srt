6
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:33,760
happy to have you here uh I hope that

7

educator preest which is in the file box

13
00:00:51,878 --> 00:00:57,558
on the lower uh right hand corner of

14
00:00:55,039 --> 00:01:00,079
your screen but if this is your first

15
00:00:57,558 --> 00:01:03,439
time visiting us for one of the webinars

16

and you have not done it um please take

17
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:10,640
a few moments either uh right now or at

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,719
the end of this um presentation to fill

19
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,680
that out and send that to Kathy

20
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:17,560
heidenrich um it's very important for

21
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:21,040
the grant and while we're on that topic

22
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:23,560
I might um also remind folks that uh we

23
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:28,280
are in the Final Phase the last three

24
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:33,159
webinars um today then March 2nd and

25
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:36,040
then the final one will be on March 9th

26
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:39,040
um and at that time we're going to have

27
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:40,280
a post test of um all the Educators

28
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:44,560
hopefully we're going to have a really

29
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:46,320
good showing for that final um webinar

30
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:48,159
because that's a very important

31
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:49,279
consideration and how effective the

32
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:53,320
webinars

33
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:56,039
are um for relaying uh educational

34
00:01:53,319 --> 00:01:57,639
information that uh extension folks can

35
00:01:56,039 --> 00:02:00,519
use out in the field with

36
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:02,280
Growers um we also want to remind

37
00:02:00,519 --> 00:02:04,879
those of you who have been in attendance

38
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:06,799
for a number of these webinars that we

39
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:09,878
are hopeful that you'll take the

40
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:12,719
opportunity to make the next step so

41
00:02:09,878 --> 00:02:16,079
using all of the materials that will be

42
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:19,000
available to you as um participants in

43
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:21,360
this first portion of the grant um we'd

44
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,560
like to have you take those educational

45
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:27,640
materials out into the field and host

46
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:31,039
some grower um grower workshops uh

47
00:02:27,639 --> 00:02:33,238
grower field days whatever and then kind

48
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:35,359
of report back to us and Kathy has some

49
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:38,519
formats and if you have any questions

50
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:40,200
you can contact her or her or myself

51
00:02:38,519 --> 00:02:42,120
about that but we'd love you to start to

52
00:02:40,199 --> 00:02:44,639
get your head around that and plan for

53
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:48,200
something this uh this growing

54
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:51,279
season all right um before we get going

55
00:02:48,199 --> 00:02:53,079
also I'd like to make sure folks know a

56
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:55,000
little bit about the webinar I think

57
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:58,239
most of you have done this but you can

58
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
type into the chat box a long narrow box

59
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:02,039
at the bottom in the center that that's

60
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,840
where you enter your comments and

61
00:03:02,039 --> 00:03:07,639
questions and I will try to keep track

62
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:09,959
of them uh please go ahead and introduce

63
00:03:07,639 --> 00:03:11,719
yourself if you haven't done that yet

64
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:15,039
even though you may feel like you do it

65
00:03:11,719 --> 00:03:16,719
every single time it's helpful for the

66
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:19,878
presenter to kind of get to know where

67
00:03:16,719 --> 00:03:23,239
everyone's from um Additionally the web

68
00:03:19,878 --> 00:03:25,239
links which is in the lower left corner

69
00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:28,680
uh you can click on that and then you

70
00:03:25,239 --> 00:03:30,840
can actually browse to that uh right now

71
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:34,400
or at the end we're going to go back to

72
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:37,239
the this kind of format at the very end

73
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:40,599
um uh so they'll be there and they'll

74
00:03:37,239 --> 00:03:44,000
also be accessible as the recorded

75
00:03:40,598 --> 00:03:46,719
webinar all right um today with this is

76
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,360
the 10th in a series of 12 um Berry crop

77
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:49,318

Sciences at Cornell University um um and

83
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:08,039
I will now switch into that presentation

84
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:09,959

and extension interests are in Precision

86
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:14,199
management of nitrogen soil health and

87
00:04:12,759 --> 00:04:16,279
space and time

88
00:04:14,199 --> 00:04:18,039
statistics um he teaches an

89
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:20,719
undergraduate course in soil management

90
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:22,879
for sustainability and a graduate course

91
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:25,759
in that space and time

92
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:27,800
statistics um he has off authored over

93
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:30,759
100 refereed Publications and four books

94
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:33,120
and advised 45 graduate students

95
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:36,600
and I'm exhausted for him so I'm really

96
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:38,478
glad that he's here um hey Harold hello

97
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:40,600
can you hear

98
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:44,439
me sounds

99
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:46,320
good okay well thank you Laura and uh

100
00:04:44,439 --> 00:04:48,879
it's a pleasure to be uh joining this

101
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:51,199
group again um I looked at my my

102
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:53,360
calendar and it was uh almost exactly

103
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:56,840
four months ago when I did the uh the

104
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:59,800
first webinar um uh one of the early

105
00:04:56,839 --> 00:05:02,560
ones on U on basic so information and

106
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:06,160
and soal management principles and uh

107
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:07,399
since then um we've discussed uh as a

108
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:10,120
group at least you know nutrient

109
00:05:07,399 --> 00:05:12,599
management and seral Health Management

110
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:14,680
and uh doing that mostly from a uh

111
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:16,919
production perspective today we're going

112
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:21,560
to be talking more about uh some of the

113
00:05:16,918 --> 00:05:24,719
environmental impacts and um and how uh

114
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:26,038
we can reduce that um let's see I'm

115
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:30,039
having a little bit of a problem there

116
00:05:26,038 --> 00:05:31,959
we go um going to the next slide okay um

117
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:34,439
the the outline for today and by the way

118
00:05:31,959 --> 00:05:35,560
I just put my picture uh up there it's a

119
00:05:34,439 --> 00:05:37,560
slightly different picture than the

120
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:40,918
other one uh just to make it a little

121
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:42,680
bit more uh more personal for you uh but

122
00:05:40,918 --> 00:05:45,198
we'll uh we'll start today with a

123
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:48,120
discussion of uh environmental loss

124
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:49,840
processes then uh erosion and runoff

125
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:52,360
prevention then we'll talk about

126
00:05:49,839 --> 00:05:54,839
managing phosphorus and then managing

127
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:57,879
nitrogen do a summary and then we'll go

128
00:05:54,839 --> 00:06:01,159
into the question and and answer session

129
00:05:57,879 --> 00:06:03,079
and I I try to organize uh the my slides

130
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:06,800
and and my presentation in a way I think

131
00:06:03,079 --> 00:06:09,000
that will will allow you to uh take some

132
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:11,240
Concepts that you can use with your

133
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:14,079
stakeholders that will help you I think

134
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:16,918
in in your educational pro

135
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:19,240
programs um so we'll we'll start at

136
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:21,318
looking at environmental losses um the

137
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:25,120
primary ones that we might be concerned

138
00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:28,240
about with uh with berry production is

139
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:31,038
uh is sediment nitrogen phosphorus and

140
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:34,038
pesticides and I should say say up front

141
00:06:31,038 --> 00:06:36,800
that that most uh most of the the berry

142
00:06:34,038 --> 00:06:38,759
production is done in a way that that is

143
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:41,160
is uh relatively sustainable has

144
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:44,199
relatively little environmental impact

145
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:46,880
say compared to corn production uh which

146
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:49,240
is more large scale uh it's an annual

147
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:51,519
crop uh it's a lot of these soils are

148
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:53,560
being tilled on an annual basis and so

149
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:56,399
when we compare that to to most Berry

150
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:59,598
crops uh we're dealing with perennials

151
00:06:56,399 --> 00:07:01,918
and um and not as much tillet and and

152
00:06:59,598 --> 00:07:05,240
typically not as much uh nutrient inputs

153
00:07:01,918 --> 00:07:08,639
either so um so often the environmental

154
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:10,079
impact may be may be smaller yet we we

155
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:11,439
we do need to be concerned about that

156
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:14,240
and we need to take that

157
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:18,160
serious so in the picture here you see

158
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:20,680
the um uh basically the the basic

159
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:23,759
hydrologic cycle and and the main point

160
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:27,000
is that these environmental losses uh

161
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:29,319
occur when we have u a lot of water in

162
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,800
the system that water of course comes

163
00:07:29,319 --> 00:07:35,000
more mostly As precipitation some cases

164
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:37,960
a little bit as as uh as irrigation but

165
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:40,160
but really it's the it's the uh extreme

166
00:07:37,959 --> 00:07:43,719
precipitation events when we get you

167
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:46,520
know an inch two or even more we uh

168
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:49,560
that's when we tend to have uh the the

169
00:07:46,519 --> 00:07:51,598
problems and um so an important concept

170
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:54,280
to consider is is what happens at the

171
00:07:51,598 --> 00:07:56,759
precipitation when it reaches the land

172
00:07:54,279 --> 00:07:59,839
surface and it can basically go in two

173
00:07:56,759 --> 00:08:01,598
directions it can either infiltrate or

174
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:04,079
uh the water that does not infiltrate

175
00:08:01,598 --> 00:08:06,680
then runs off and creates all kinds of

176
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:09,439
problems because it will take with it

177
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:11,639
these uh contaminants like sediment

178
00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:15,000
nitrogen and phosphorus and if it takes

179
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:18,158
sediment then we refer to it that as as

180
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:20,759
erosion um and uh that may readily of

181
00:08:18,158 --> 00:08:23,879
course reach uh streams or other water

182
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:26,280
bodies like lakes and naries and uh that

183
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:29,599
is uh in general very

184
00:08:26,279 --> 00:08:31,119
undesirable but uh if we're lucky that

185
00:08:29,598 --> 00:08:34,158
the water infiltrates and then it's

186
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:37,799
being held in the in the soil I like to

187
00:08:34,158 --> 00:08:39,639
refer to the soil as a sponge and uh and

188
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:42,399
the soil holds on to that water and then

189
00:08:39,639 --> 00:08:45,080
makes that available to the plants um

190
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:47,080
through evapo transpiration if there's

191
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:49,920
excess water in the soil then it will

192
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:52,040
percolate further down either to deeper

193
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:55,639
groundw or maybe shallow ground water

194
00:08:52,039 --> 00:08:58,120
that might eventually reach a stream so

195
00:08:55,639 --> 00:09:00,278
those are are are the processes and so

196
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:03,278
if chemicals go with the percolating

197
00:09:00,278 --> 00:09:06,240
water then we refer to that as as

198
00:09:03,278 --> 00:09:09,360
leeching so if we think about these lost

199
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:11,680
Pathways the um uh the ones that we're

200
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:14,200
concerned about are are runoff with

201
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:16,599
mostly with phosphorus to a lesser

202
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:20,320
extent with nitrogen and then maybe with

203
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:22,159
pesticides uh for uh erosion which means

204
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:25,278
that runoff that takes with it all the

205
00:09:22,159 --> 00:09:26,919
sentiments and the siment in turn may

206
00:09:25,278 --> 00:09:30,200
have a lot of phosphorus with it or some

207
00:09:26,919 --> 00:09:32,360
nitrogen and pesticides um so all of

208
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:33,200
these contaminants are concerned when we

209
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:36,800
have

210
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:39,079
erosion erosion is a really bad thing um

211
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:41,159
when we have leeching we're concerned uh

212
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:43,919
mostly with nitrates and pesticides

213
00:09:41,159 --> 00:09:46,559
phosphorus uh basically doesn't leech

214
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:48,639
except in some very unusual

215
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:52,039
circumstances and then we finally we

216
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:53,879
have a concern about gaseous losses um

217
00:09:52,039 --> 00:09:57,039
and that is typically not directly

218
00:09:53,879 --> 00:09:59,439
driven by by water but indirectly

219
00:09:57,039 --> 00:10:01,480
especially when it comes to uh nitrous o

220
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,880
oide which is generated when the soil

221
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:06,440
becomes anerobic and so when it's

222
00:10:03,879 --> 00:10:08,559
saturated there's no air in the soil and

223
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:11,600
then the nitrogen is

224
00:10:08,559 --> 00:10:14,359
transformed uh from say nitrate to

225
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:16,000
nitrous oxide and of course uh this is a

226
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:18,440
big concern because it's a serious

227
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:22,120
greenhouse gas it's 300 times more

228
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:24,720
potent than um than carbon

229
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:27,039
dioxide um and we may have some gaseous

230
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:29,120
losses of pesticides which is really um

231
00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:30,519
unrelated to to water typically that has

232
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,679
to to do with the properties of the

233
00:10:30,519 --> 00:10:34,799
pesticide

234
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:36,919
itself and uh I'm not going to discuss P

235
00:10:34,799 --> 00:10:38,838
pesticides in detail uh today it's a

236
00:10:36,919 --> 00:10:40,240
little bit beyond the scope of uh of

237
00:10:38,839 --> 00:10:44,880
what we wanted to talk about so we're

238
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:47,600
going to focus on sediment nitrogen and

239
00:10:44,879 --> 00:10:50,200
phosphorus so the environmental loss

240
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:53,278
potential in in general is is affected

241
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:55,200
by a number of factors so one obviously

242
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:57,919
the weather we discussed that if you

243
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:59,720
have a lot of intensive uh rainfall you

244
00:10:57,919 --> 00:11:03,199
have higher potential for runoff and

245
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:06,079
erosion and excess water also generates

246
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:08,759
leeching secondarily we have these

247
00:11:06,078 --> 00:11:11,239
inherent Cil properties like texture and

248
00:11:08,759 --> 00:11:13,600
organic matter which also affect you

249
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:15,039
know basically where the water goes and

250
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:17,480
what it takes with it and then we we'll

251
00:11:15,039 --> 00:11:19,879
discuss that in a little bit more detail

252
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:21,920
thirdly soil health and we've talked

253
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:24,799
about that Bob shinel Beck mentioned uh

254
00:11:21,919 --> 00:11:26,719
that in the previous webinars so if we

255
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:29,319
build up our soil and we make it healthy

256
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:32,200
with say good aggregation then we can

257
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:35,519
reduce the environmental loss potential

258
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:37,440
significantly and then um finally

259
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:40,399
perhaps the what we might call the more

260
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:43,279
real-time soil management practices uh

261
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:45,360
such as whether we cultivate the soil uh

262
00:11:43,278 --> 00:11:48,078
which may expose it to the elements

263
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:50,440
whether we have soil cover like mulch uh

264
00:11:48,078 --> 00:11:52,879
whether we traffic the soil causing

265
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:56,760
compaction and those kind of things and

266
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:58,759
then of course last and not least is um

267
00:11:56,759 --> 00:12:00,519
is you know how much fertilizer we apply

268
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:02,399
either or organic or inorganic

269
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:05,039
fertilizer and where we where we place

270
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:08,799
it uh because of in principle the more

271
00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:10,399
fertilizer or other organic uh um

272
00:12:08,799 --> 00:12:13,759
materials that we put out there the

273
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:16,839
higher the potential that we have losses

274
00:12:13,759 --> 00:12:19,720
so we'll we'll come back to these

275
00:12:16,839 --> 00:12:21,959
individually um but first let's let's

276
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:23,759
let's discuss you know the the basic

277
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:26,799
inherent properties of soils and how

278
00:12:23,759 --> 00:12:29,720
that affects potential environmental

279
00:12:26,799 --> 00:12:32,039
impacts uh you know texture or or the

280
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:35,160
distribution of particle sizes in terms

281
00:12:32,039 --> 00:12:37,078
of sand silt and Clay is uh is probably

282
00:12:35,159 --> 00:12:39,399
the most fundamental property and you

283
00:12:37,078 --> 00:12:40,559
know we're all familiar uh with the the

284
00:12:39,399 --> 00:12:43,799
textural

285
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:46,278
triangle um and it it provides the basis

286
00:12:43,799 --> 00:12:48,359
for a lot of these environmental loss

287
00:12:46,278 --> 00:12:51,958
considerations I like to talk to my

288
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:54,159
students or to stakeholders uh as as the

289
00:12:51,958 --> 00:12:56,399
the soil particles and the the texture

290
00:12:54,159 --> 00:12:58,719
of the soil sort of defining what we

291
00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:01,159
might call the house uh the basic

292
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:04,399
structure of of the soil and I like to

293
00:13:01,159 --> 00:13:06,120
use the analogy of a of of a house in

294
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:07,919
that you know the uh you have the

295
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:09,919
structure of the house which is the the

296
00:13:07,919 --> 00:13:12,360
walls and the the roof and the basement

297
00:13:09,919 --> 00:13:15,439
and all that and that's the most visible

298
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:17,278
part of the of a house and and in

299
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:20,079
particles for the soil that's what you

300
00:13:17,278 --> 00:13:21,919
see uh the most interesting part however

301
00:13:20,078 --> 00:13:24,719
is what's what happens in the

302
00:13:21,919 --> 00:13:26,559
spaces um between the soil particles or

303
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:29,240
with the house analogy what happens in

304
00:13:26,559 --> 00:13:32,198
the rooms because that's where uh all

305
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:34,320
the processes take place that's where uh

306
00:13:32,198 --> 00:13:35,679
the organisms are that's where the life

307
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:38,720
is and that's where the interesting

308
00:13:35,679 --> 00:13:41,319
things happen so in soils there's

309
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:43,959
there's bacteria fungi all kinds of

310
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:46,040
organisms that live in the pores and

311
00:13:43,958 --> 00:13:48,479
that's also where all the important

312
00:13:46,039 --> 00:13:51,879
processes of water and air movement

313
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:54,120
occur so I'd like to have people farmers

314
00:13:51,879 --> 00:13:55,759
and students to to think in soil in

315
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:57,560
terms of soil not just in terms of the

316
00:13:55,759 --> 00:14:00,680
particles but have them think in terms

317
00:13:57,559 --> 00:14:04,119
of the spaces between the particles

318
00:14:00,679 --> 00:14:07,000
so um when we think about a sandy soil

319
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:09,839
then most of those pores are relatively

320
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,278
large um although in general terms we're

321
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:14,639
still talking about less than 2

322
00:14:11,278 --> 00:14:16,799
millimeters in in most cases um but by

323
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:18,879
by S standards those are very large uh

324
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:21,838
pores and those pores will lose their

325
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:25,078
water very quickly because the capillary

326
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:27,959
force that we see in large pores is is

327
00:14:25,078 --> 00:14:29,559
relatively weak conversely when we talk

328
00:14:27,958 --> 00:14:32,359
about clay soils

329
00:14:29,559 --> 00:14:34,838
we mostly have small pores the capillary

330
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:36,919
force is really really strong and they

331
00:14:34,839 --> 00:14:39,680
retain the water very

332
00:14:36,919 --> 00:14:42,519
tightly okay uh but if we have a clay

333
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:45,000
soil that actually has good aggregation

334
00:14:42,519 --> 00:14:47,039
then uh we may have a few larger pores

335
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:52,440
that are are between the Aggregates so

336
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:52,439
then we maybe have both small and large

337
00:14:55,159 --> 00:15:02,759
pores so this is an example of of of an

338
00:14:59,559 --> 00:15:06,559
aggregate that uh has the the range of

339
00:15:02,759 --> 00:15:09,800
of pores so it has the the larger pores

340
00:15:06,559 --> 00:15:12,838
um and those facilitate infiltration and

341
00:15:09,799 --> 00:15:14,719
drainage eras and rooting because they

342
00:15:12,839 --> 00:15:18,959
lose the water very quickly because of

343
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:21,839
the weak capillary Force the small pores

344
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:24,559
um they retain the water very well and

345
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:26,320
so they facilitate both water and and

346
00:15:24,559 --> 00:15:28,318
nutrient retention so when we're

347
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:30,319
concerned for example about leeching we

348
00:15:28,318 --> 00:15:33,639
like to see these nutrients being

349
00:15:30,318 --> 00:15:36,919
retained in in the

350
00:15:33,639 --> 00:15:40,440
soil so I have a question for you here

351
00:15:36,919 --> 00:15:42,039
um actually two questions first one is

352
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:46,000
uh which soil has a higher leeching

353
00:15:42,039 --> 00:15:47,958
potential a sand a silt or a clay and

354
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,399
the second question is which soil has a

355
00:15:47,958 --> 00:15:53,559
higher runoff and denitrification

356
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:56,198
potential the gaseous losses of nitrogen

357
00:15:53,559 --> 00:15:58,359
the sand the silt or the

358
00:15:56,198 --> 00:16:02,278
clay and I'm sure you all got this

359
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:03,680
question uh just right um it's the of

360
00:16:02,278 --> 00:16:05,439
course the sand that has the highest

361
00:16:03,679 --> 00:16:08,318
leeching potential because it's mostly

362
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:10,720
large pores doesn't retain the water in

363
00:16:08,318 --> 00:16:13,599
the nutrients very well so they easily

364
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:16,639
wash out with the percolating water and

365
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:18,959
for two uh it's of course the clay that

366
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:20,879
has a higher runoff potential mostly

367
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:24,479
small pores so not very good

368
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:27,318
infiltration capacity and uh because it

369
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:29,319
is mostly small pores the irration can

370
00:16:27,318 --> 00:16:31,958
often become a problem when you get a

371
00:16:29,318 --> 00:16:34,399
lot of water and so you have higher

372
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:37,278
denitrification so I I'm sure you all

373
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:40,759
got those answers correct so when we go

374
00:16:37,278 --> 00:16:43,240
back to our textural triangle um again

375
00:16:40,759 --> 00:16:45,639
so we're talking about the more Sandy

376
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:48,240
soils like a sand the lomy sand Sandy

377
00:16:45,639 --> 00:16:50,680
LOM lot of large pores high leeching

378
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:53,278
potential uh when we have higher clay

379
00:16:50,679 --> 00:16:56,479
contents we tend to have higher runoff

380
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:56,480
and denitrification

381
00:16:56,919 --> 00:17:03,120
potential now let's look at thinks a

382
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:05,679
little bit more in in a landscape uh

383
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:08,959
perspective and uh we often use the term

384
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:10,959
hydrologically sensitive areas for for

385
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:14,600
uh parts of the landscape that have a

386
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:16,720
high potential for pollutant losses and

387
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:19,798
uh in some cases we're concerned about

388
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:22,880
runoff uh surface losses in other cases

389
00:17:19,798 --> 00:17:25,798
it's leeching and subsurface recharge

390
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:27,720
losses um so when we uh where where do

391
00:17:25,798 --> 00:17:30,000
we in the landscape have high runoff

392
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:32,240
losses in flood planes and this is kind

393
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,440
of an interesting uh scenario because

394
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:36,640
most flood planes actually uh tend to

395
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:40,200
have relatively coarse textured soils

396
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:42,080
like gravels or kind of Sandy soils um

397
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:44,679
that uh that you might say well they

398
00:17:42,079 --> 00:17:47,639
have high infiltration capacity but

399
00:17:44,679 --> 00:17:50,160
because they are located near stream uh

400
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:52,440
basically if you get uh heavy rains you

401
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:54,480
get flooding then uh basically

402
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:57,640
everything goes uh so you have not a lot

403
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:59,759
of nutrients uh on the soil or the soil

404
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:02,440
is very poorly protect ected then a lot

405
00:17:59,759 --> 00:18:04,079
of that gets lost and in the Northeast

406
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:06,798
we certainly experienced that this year

407
00:18:04,079 --> 00:18:08,678
with h with a hurricane and and uh and a

408
00:18:06,798 --> 00:18:11,679
followup in parts of the Northeast with

409
00:18:08,679 --> 00:18:13,960
the with some other heavy uh rainfall

410
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:16,360
events so similarly areas that are

411
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:18,400
adjacent to flowing or standing water uh

412
00:18:16,359 --> 00:18:20,759
bodies are hydrologically sensitive

413
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:23,000
primarily because they tend to be wetter

414
00:18:20,759 --> 00:18:24,519
areas in the landscape and because they

415
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:27,000
are close to these water bodies so

416
00:18:24,519 --> 00:18:29,119
there's very little buffer very little

417
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,599
opportunity to filter out some of these

418
00:18:29,119 --> 00:18:34,479
these contaminants areas with low

419
00:18:31,599 --> 00:18:36,480
infiltration capacity are concerned

420
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:38,759
maybe because the soil has become

421
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:43,120
compacted or sometimes it's even when

422
00:18:38,759 --> 00:18:45,200
it's adjacent to uh say a road or um or

423
00:18:43,119 --> 00:18:47,599
or or some other you know compacted area

424
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:51,240
where the runoff that comes off that

425
00:18:47,599 --> 00:18:55,038
area then goes onto a field and may uh

426
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:56,640
reduce runoff and erosion on the field

427
00:18:55,038 --> 00:18:59,038
and then areas generally that are

428
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:00,919
saturated that are already wet have a

429
00:18:59,038 --> 00:19:03,960
high runoff potential as

430
00:19:00,919 --> 00:19:05,480
well okay so let's then think about uh

431
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:08,279
about the leeching and subservice

432
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:10,400
recharge areas um the ones that we're

433
00:19:08,279 --> 00:19:12,558
mostly concerned about are are areas

434
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:16,080
that are close to either Wells or

435
00:19:12,558 --> 00:19:18,158
Springs these are are typically areas

436
00:19:16,079 --> 00:19:20,678
that have very permeable soils and when

437
00:19:18,159 --> 00:19:22,960
you're very close to these water sources

438
00:19:20,679 --> 00:19:25,440
that people use for drinking water we

439
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:28,480
need to be extra careful and so that's

440
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:30,840
uh those those are sensitive areas and

441
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:34,440
in general areas with very permeable

442
00:19:30,839 --> 00:19:37,079
soils are also of concern so we have to

443
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:40,360
think a little bit in terms of uh of the

444
00:19:37,079 --> 00:19:42,199
of the location that uh that a field or

445
00:19:40,359 --> 00:19:45,319
Farm might have in the

446
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:46,880
landscape and so you know going back to

447
00:19:45,319 --> 00:19:49,079
my earlier presentation from a few

448
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:52,080
months ago uh we talked about soil

449
00:19:49,079 --> 00:19:54,519
survey reports and and how useful that

450
00:19:52,079 --> 00:19:57,119
information is whether you're using the

451
00:19:54,519 --> 00:19:59,440
the the paper copies uh with the

452
00:19:57,119 --> 00:20:02,558
traditional Maps or whether you go to

453
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:05,240
the uh online version the so-called web

454
00:20:02,558 --> 00:20:07,759
seral survey which is just a fantastic

455
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:11,000
Tool uh it provides you with information

456
00:20:07,759 --> 00:20:15,000
on basic s properties on suitability for

457
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:17,440
use and uh in this case also the

458
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:20,079
environmental loss potential so the S

459
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:23,120
survey can be a very good sort of first

460
00:20:20,079 --> 00:20:24,639
source of information to uh to start

461
00:20:23,119 --> 00:20:26,199
thinking about these problems and how to

462
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:29,679
address

463
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:31,600
them okay so let's um let's look at at

464
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:34,320
one of the concerns that we have and

465
00:20:31,599 --> 00:20:36,439
that's that's erosion and there's two

466
00:20:34,319 --> 00:20:39,918
aspects of erosion that are undesirable

467
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:42,798
one it removes the good soil it it

468
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:45,400
removes the soil right from the surface

469
00:20:42,798 --> 00:20:47,759
um it uh it's typically uh the soil

470
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:48,919
that's the highest in organic matter and

471
00:20:47,759 --> 00:20:51,759
that's the most

472
00:20:48,919 --> 00:20:54,038
desirable and um and what it leaves

473
00:20:51,759 --> 00:20:56,240
behind typically is the uh kind of the

474
00:20:54,038 --> 00:20:59,400
grally material the coarse fragments

475
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:03,159
that don't get washed away as easily

476
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:05,120
by the runoff water so uh with many

477
00:21:03,159 --> 00:21:07,720
years of erosion we basically lose our

478
00:21:05,119 --> 00:21:09,959
our best soil the other aspect of course

479
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:12,200
is that uh this soil ends up somewhere

480
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:15,480
else as as sediment and this pollutes

481
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:18,919
Water Resources with it streams or

482
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:23,159
eventually going into lakes or estuaries

483
00:21:18,919 --> 00:21:26,080
or or rivers and uh this uh this covers

484
00:21:23,159 --> 00:21:29,240
uh aquatic habitat um it makes it less

485
00:21:26,079 --> 00:21:32,519
suitable for uh drinking water or even

486
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:35,000
navigation so uh both of these aspects

487
00:21:32,519 --> 00:21:37,519
of course are highly undesirable and

488
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,519
erosion really remains uh a large

489
00:21:37,519 --> 00:21:41,038
problem uh here in the in the United

490
00:21:39,519 --> 00:21:44,319
States we we still have a lot of

491
00:21:41,038 --> 00:21:47,119
concerns about it so there's a number of

492
00:21:44,319 --> 00:21:49,720
factors that that affect that soil type

493
00:21:47,119 --> 00:21:51,839
and slope so uh typically soils that

494
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:54,960
have a high runoff potential also have

495
00:21:51,839 --> 00:21:57,119
higher erosion potential steeper slopes

496
00:21:54,960 --> 00:22:00,319
of course are of Greater

497
00:21:57,119 --> 00:22:03,599
concern uh so Health can be a big factor

498
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:06,839
as well if we if we basically build the

499
00:22:03,599 --> 00:22:09,480
soil up with a good aggregation uh good

500
00:22:06,839 --> 00:22:12,319
plant rooting that you know pumps the

501
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:15,480
water out very well uh we are going to

502
00:22:12,319 --> 00:22:17,639
be reducing the erosion potential and

503
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:19,240
then also surface management you know

504
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:22,159
whether we keep the soil covered or

505
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:23,679
whether it's exposed using pets or you

506
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:26,640
know herbici sites or something like

507
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:28,919
that that can greatly in influence the

508
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:31,559
erosion potential

509
00:22:28,919 --> 00:22:33,799
so here's a quick illustration of that

510
00:22:31,558 --> 00:22:35,918
that uh that shows these uh these four

511
00:22:33,798 --> 00:22:40,079
graphs in different stages of the

512
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:44,120
development of of erosion so uh on the

513
00:22:40,079 --> 00:22:47,079
the top left uh we see a raindrop uh and

514
00:22:44,119 --> 00:22:49,399
a raindrop actually has a uh has a

515
00:22:47,079 --> 00:22:51,678
certain amount of energy basically from

516
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:53,840
its mass and its

517
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:56,519
velocity uh it then reaches the land

518
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:59,599
surface and that is basically uh what

519
00:22:56,519 --> 00:23:02,319
initially you know creates the concern

520
00:22:59,599 --> 00:23:05,719
when the soil is dry it is relatively

521
00:23:02,319 --> 00:23:07,720
hard and initially uh resilient and can

522
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:10,960
absorb the energy over that that

523
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:14,120
raindrop but as the soil starts to wet

524
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:18,440
up it becomes soft and it becomes

525
00:23:14,119 --> 00:23:21,199
weaker um and the Raindrop uh energy is

526
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:23,798
cannot be absorbed quite as well to the

527
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:27,480
point where that surface layer becomes

528
00:23:23,798 --> 00:23:29,480
very soft and uh very susceptible to the

529
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:32,440
energy of the raindrop up which may

530
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:35,880
cause then the Aggregates or the soil

531
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:38,320
itself to be uh smashed and uh and

532
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:40,440
dispersed and you see that here in the

533
00:23:38,319 --> 00:23:42,439
in the the picture you see the very soft

534
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:44,960
soil and you can actually see the impact

535
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:47,840
of the addition the the individual

536
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:50,480
raindrops that basically destroy the

537
00:23:47,839 --> 00:23:52,720
soil you start to see water accumulating

538
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:54,519
at the surface and if this is on even a

539
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:59,000
even a modest slope you start to

540
00:23:54,519 --> 00:24:03,038
initiate runoff and then erosion

541
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:06,720
um now one thing we could do is um is of

542
00:24:03,038 --> 00:24:09,798
course we could try to cover that soil

543
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:13,319
um with say mulch or you know some other

544
00:24:09,798 --> 00:24:17,599
type of of uh uh say organic compound

545
00:24:13,319 --> 00:24:20,079
maybe even uh even some compost and uh

546
00:24:17,599 --> 00:24:21,719
and that uh that material that surface

547
00:24:20,079 --> 00:24:25,480
cover can

548
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:27,360
then absorb the energy of the raindrops

549
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:29,319
so instead of it falling directly onto

550
00:24:27,359 --> 00:24:32,558
the soil it's being absorbed by say The

551
00:24:29,319 --> 00:24:34,359
Mulch and this greatly greatly reduces

552
00:24:32,558 --> 00:24:38,119
the erosion potential so one of the best

553
00:24:34,359 --> 00:24:39,798
things we can do to reduce erosion is to

554
00:24:38,119 --> 00:24:42,439
uh have the soil

555
00:24:39,798 --> 00:24:45,519
covered and that's depicted here in this

556
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:49,440
you know rather famous graph that shows

557
00:24:45,519 --> 00:24:50,480
the relative erosion or soil loss from 0

558
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:53,519
to

559
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:57,519
100% And the uh percentage service

560
00:24:53,519 --> 00:24:59,000
residue so if we have bare soil we have

561
00:24:57,519 --> 00:25:02,119
uh losses at

562
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:05,880
100% um but we see down a fairly rapid

563
00:25:02,119 --> 00:25:08,678
decrease in the erosion losses uh with

564
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:10,760
even with modest um modest amounts of

565
00:25:08,679 --> 00:25:14,720
service residue so if we have about 30%

566
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:19,359
service residue we reduce the erosion

567
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:20,960
losses by about 60% from 100 to 40 and

568
00:25:19,359 --> 00:25:23,398
then if we increase the amount of

569
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:26,519
service residue in the end we end up

570
00:25:23,398 --> 00:25:28,479
with relatively low erosion losses so

571
00:25:26,519 --> 00:25:31,599
one of the best things we can do uh in

572
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:34,079
terms of reducing erosion losses is to

573
00:25:31,599 --> 00:25:36,199
cover the soil and the good thing is

574
00:25:34,079 --> 00:25:39,639
this also has a lot of benefits in terms

575
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:41,880
of uh building uh healthy soils to

576
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:43,559
reduce the effects of you know extreme

577
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:46,760
water and temperature conditions at the

578
00:25:43,558 --> 00:25:50,158
surface to promote biological activities

579
00:25:46,759 --> 00:25:54,960
so to some extent uh it is a no-brainer

580
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:54,960
to put U mulch or other materials on the

581
00:25:56,038 --> 00:26:00,839
surface so uh in terms of erosion and

582
00:25:59,079 --> 00:26:02,839
runoff then what are sort of the main

583
00:26:00,839 --> 00:26:05,119
strategies you know in

584
00:26:02,839 --> 00:26:07,079
summary avoid fields that are prone to

585
00:26:05,119 --> 00:26:08,319
flooding or have high runoff potential

586
00:26:07,079 --> 00:26:10,599
if at all

587
00:26:08,319 --> 00:26:14,398
possible keep the soil covered with

588
00:26:10,599 --> 00:26:16,319
mulch or residue or even compost build

589
00:26:14,398 --> 00:26:18,599
and maintain soal Health especially

590
00:26:16,319 --> 00:26:22,000
aggregation to increase infiltration

591
00:26:18,599 --> 00:26:25,158
capacity and reduce the runoff potential

592
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:27,798
and then uh use grass Alleyways

593
00:26:25,159 --> 00:26:29,679
preferably along the Contour so there's

594
00:26:27,798 --> 00:26:32,158
some pictures here this this shows of

595
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:35,919
course the the surface mulch this is

596
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:38,000
also soil that has received uh compost

597
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:40,919
and so it's in really good shape kind of

598
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:44,519
like the soil that you see here uh this

599
00:26:40,919 --> 00:26:46,759
is a picture that shows um these

600
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:50,720
Alleyways that in the winter time will

601
00:26:46,759 --> 00:26:53,879
have a a rye C crop and this can then be

602
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:57,079
mowed onto the rows this in this case we

603
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:59,200
have grapes here uh in South Africa but

604
00:26:57,079 --> 00:27:01,798
we can use that then as a mulch to go

605
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:04,038
into the into the rose uh of course you

606
00:27:01,798 --> 00:27:06,319
can bring in external sources of mulch

607
00:27:04,038 --> 00:27:09,278
as well and then the the bottom picture

608
00:27:06,319 --> 00:27:11,398
shows you a a grass Alleyway especially

609
00:27:09,278 --> 00:27:13,679
if it's along the Contour that's good

610
00:27:11,398 --> 00:27:15,719
because it will infiltrate water quite

611
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:18,320
well it will filter out any sediment

612
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:21,679
that might come from the rows if they

613
00:27:18,319 --> 00:27:23,439
are unprotected so those are uh some

614
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:25,278
some good management approaches that are

615
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:27,640
really not difficult to implement and in

616
00:27:25,278 --> 00:27:30,038
fact are being implemented by most Berry

617
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:33,360
Growers

618
00:27:30,038 --> 00:27:34,359
okay so let's um continue on and now

619
00:27:33,359 --> 00:27:36,479
talk about

620
00:27:34,359 --> 00:27:38,599
nutrients in the early seminar we

621
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:40,919
discussed the the nine what we call

622
00:27:38,599 --> 00:27:44,278
macro elements the elements that plants

623
00:27:40,919 --> 00:27:46,440
need in relatively large uh quantities

624
00:27:44,278 --> 00:27:50,359
so the the the carbon oxygen and

625
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:53,558
hydrogen are uh are available plentiful

626
00:27:50,359 --> 00:27:55,798
uh in the natural world and uh it's

627
00:27:53,558 --> 00:27:58,240
primarily the nitrogen and the

628
00:27:55,798 --> 00:28:01,038
phosphorus that are the ones that are

629
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:04,000
are applied in large quantities but are

630
00:28:01,038 --> 00:28:06,240
also of environmental concerns uh so

631
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:11,079
that's what we'll be focusing

632
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:14,240
on so this uh this pictograph shows uh

633
00:28:11,079 --> 00:28:16,918
the difference in loss Pathways between

634
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:19,720
nitrogen here on the top versus

635
00:28:16,919 --> 00:28:21,799
phosphorus on on the bottom and although

636
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:24,079
they are both nutrients they behave very

637
00:28:21,798 --> 00:28:26,079
differently in the soil and they have

638
00:28:24,079 --> 00:28:29,359
very different impacts so we'll we'll

639
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:32,158
discuss those in some more detail

640
00:28:29,359 --> 00:28:34,719
so nitrogen can be in the soil in in

641
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:36,120
both organic or inorganic form as

642
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:39,600
nitrate and

643
00:28:36,119 --> 00:28:41,278
ammonium um most of the nitrogen we hope

644
00:28:39,599 --> 00:28:43,959
will be taken up by the crop I mean

645
00:28:41,278 --> 00:28:45,798
that's that's our objective and that's

646
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:49,880
uh that promotes good

647
00:28:45,798 --> 00:28:51,759
growth um it may run off or erode but

648
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:55,360
typically with nitrogen those are that's

649
00:28:51,759 --> 00:28:58,240
a relatively insignificant loss pathway

650
00:28:55,359 --> 00:29:00,719
it's mostly the leeching and the

651
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:02,798
volatilization and denitrification that

652
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:05,079
are the primary loss

653
00:29:02,798 --> 00:29:07,918
Pathways and so those are the ones that

654
00:29:05,079 --> 00:29:12,599
we are are concerned about they are both

655
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:15,038
uh initiated by very wet soil conditions

656
00:29:12,599 --> 00:29:17,038
now phosphorus on the other hand can uh

657
00:29:15,038 --> 00:29:21,319
be in the soil also in organic and

658
00:29:17,038 --> 00:29:22,960
mineral form again the uh desired

659
00:29:21,319 --> 00:29:26,558
pathway is crop

660
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:29,000
uptake U leeching uh is only a problem

661
00:29:26,558 --> 00:29:31,720
in some very rare cases where there's

662
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:34,359
just excessive amounts hugely excessive

663
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:36,399
amounts of phosphorus in the soil uh

664
00:29:34,359 --> 00:29:38,278
where we're dealing with very sandy soil

665
00:29:36,398 --> 00:29:40,439
with shallow water tables but in most

666
00:29:38,278 --> 00:29:43,519
cases it's really the runoff and the

667
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:45,600
erosion that's a primary concern with

668
00:29:43,519 --> 00:29:47,120
phosphorus so let's look at each of

669
00:29:45,599 --> 00:29:49,240
these in a little bit more detail

670
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:52,959
starting with phosphorus so here's our

671
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:55,880
pictograph again um so it's primarily

672
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:59,000
the runoff and the erosion that's of of

673
00:29:55,880 --> 00:30:01,919
concern here's a picture uh from a lake

674
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:04,558
in Canada with with a barrier in between

675
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:06,559
that shows uh the area that received

676
00:30:04,558 --> 00:30:10,639
phosphorus inputs and then the area that

677
00:30:06,558 --> 00:30:14,000
did not um most of the freshwater lakes

678
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:16,720
in the in the in North America are

679
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:19,119
phosphorus limited and it actually takes

680
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:21,919
relatively little phosphorus to induce

681
00:30:19,119 --> 00:30:25,119
utr fication or algae growth or even

682
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:27,038
acatic vegetation and uh this is to some

683
00:30:25,119 --> 00:30:29,839
extent the natural process but it gets

684
00:30:27,038 --> 00:30:32,720
accelerated by phosphorus that comes

685
00:30:29,839 --> 00:30:35,038
from from farms again Berry Farms are

686
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:37,679
probably not a huge contributor but uh

687
00:30:35,038 --> 00:30:39,158
but they could contribute um with poor

688
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:41,120
management

689
00:30:39,159 --> 00:30:44,120
practices well one thing we need to keep

690
00:30:41,119 --> 00:30:47,000
in mind because erosion and runoff are

691
00:30:44,119 --> 00:30:49,439
the primary uh processes for phosphorous

692
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:52,159
losses then you know from that of course

693
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:54,679
it's a logical conclusion to say

694
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:57,639
practices that reduce runoff and erosion

695
00:30:54,679 --> 00:31:00,639
also reduce phospherous losses and so

696
00:30:57,638 --> 00:31:02,638
you know having uh surface mulch uh

697
00:31:00,638 --> 00:31:05,079
improving infiltration capacity through

698
00:31:02,638 --> 00:31:07,319
good soil Health Management Etc these

699
00:31:05,079 --> 00:31:09,319
are all practices that also reduce

700
00:31:07,319 --> 00:31:11,519
phosphorus

701
00:31:09,319 --> 00:31:14,720
losses but there's another dimension to

702
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:17,679
that and that's basically the the the

703
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:20,960
the accumulation of phosphorus in in the

704
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:23,600
soil if we end up with lots and lots of

705
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:26,600
phosphorus in the soil then we increase

706
00:31:23,599 --> 00:31:29,278
the loss potential and that's uh an

707
00:31:26,599 --> 00:31:32,240
additional concern so if we just think

708
00:31:29,278 --> 00:31:35,079
about uh phosphorus levels in terms of a

709
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:38,038
a seral test level which we of course

710
00:31:35,079 --> 00:31:40,038
measure on a regular basis uh we know

711
00:31:38,038 --> 00:31:43,720
that if the seral test levels are are

712
00:31:40,038 --> 00:31:46,519
very low that we have uh reductions in

713
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:49,759
yield and uh that there is sort of a

714
00:31:46,519 --> 00:31:52,120
point where you say well um uh there's

715
00:31:49,759 --> 00:31:54,359
sufficient phosphorus in the soil for

716
00:31:52,119 --> 00:31:57,119
good Crop Production we have sort of an

717
00:31:54,359 --> 00:32:00,240
Optimum range but then if we really get

718
00:31:57,119 --> 00:32:02,959
too much phosph in the soil then um then

719
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:05,599
we have excess and this excess

720
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:07,798
phosphorus is much more susceptible to

721
00:32:05,599 --> 00:32:11,079
losses through runoff and

722
00:32:07,798 --> 00:32:13,119
erosion um and that's that's a concern

723
00:32:11,079 --> 00:32:16,240
so the above graph is basically kind of

724
00:32:13,119 --> 00:32:18,479
a hypothetical uh case on the bottom

725
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:20,638
here I'm showing you some some real data

726
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:23,120
of relative yield this is for corn and

727
00:32:20,638 --> 00:32:26,359
alphalpha and grass but it shows you

728
00:32:23,119 --> 00:32:29,359
that uh in this case for uh for a Morgan

729
00:32:26,359 --> 00:32:32,759
extractable p that if you're sort of in

730
00:32:29,359 --> 00:32:35,038
this range of four to six uh that's sort

731
00:32:32,759 --> 00:32:38,879
of where the cut off is between going

732
00:32:35,038 --> 00:32:41,158
from below Optimum to to Optimum and so

733
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:43,320
you don't have any yield increase beyond

734
00:32:41,159 --> 00:32:45,840
that uh but in at some point in time

735
00:32:43,319 --> 00:32:50,119
you're starting to get into excessive

736
00:32:45,839 --> 00:32:53,439
levels and even though um this the the

737
00:32:50,119 --> 00:32:55,798
response to soal P levels is often quite

738
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:58,120
somewhat variable and low Precision uh

739
00:32:55,798 --> 00:33:00,839
there is really strong agreement that

740
00:32:58,119 --> 00:33:02,558
these levels U that there is a certain

741
00:33:00,839 --> 00:33:04,798
level where you really have an an

742
00:33:02,558 --> 00:33:08,240
Optimum amount of phosphorus in the soil

743
00:33:04,798 --> 00:33:10,440
not deficient and and not

744
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:13,679
excessive and so I just wanted to show

745
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:16,360
you as a comparison because many of you

746
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:18,399
may be using different extractants you

747
00:33:16,359 --> 00:33:21,638
know here in the Northeast uh we mostly

748
00:33:18,398 --> 00:33:23,918
use um um modified Morgan or which is

749
00:33:21,638 --> 00:33:26,519
just like Morgan certainly in terms of

750
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:31,960
phosphorus uh some of you may be using

751
00:33:26,519 --> 00:33:33,798
Olen or Bray or or mic one or mic 3 and

752
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:37,319
um and this here shows the different

753
00:33:33,798 --> 00:33:39,839
ranges because the extractants uh are

754
00:33:37,319 --> 00:33:42,038
are slightly different and they uh end

755
00:33:39,839 --> 00:33:44,599
end up with extracting a little bit more

756
00:33:42,038 --> 00:33:47,319
a little bit less phosphorus um

757
00:33:44,599 --> 00:33:49,879
depending on the method and uh so they

758
00:33:47,319 --> 00:33:53,278
each have their ranges in terms of low

759
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:55,519
Optimum high and very high and it's

760
00:33:53,278 --> 00:33:57,440
under the very high where we get to be

761
00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:59,558
concerned about excessive phosphorus

762
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:02,679
level losses and so we would like to be

763
00:33:59,558 --> 00:34:04,000
able to to prevent that from happening

764
00:34:02,679 --> 00:34:06,679
we don't want to have too much

765
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:09,440
phosphorus in the soil um that will

766
00:34:06,679 --> 00:34:12,760
possibly cause environmental

767
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:16,800
concerns uh now in most cases if uh if a

768
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:18,560
farmer uh regularly soil tests and um

769
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:21,200
and is very careful about how much they

770
00:34:18,559 --> 00:34:23,599
apply uh you don't really see any

771
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:26,158
problems with that the cases where you

772
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:28,919
do see that uh occurring is typically

773
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:30,599
with a lot of organic inputs so we see

774
00:34:28,918 --> 00:34:33,039
that with manure especially say on a

775
00:34:30,599 --> 00:34:35,960
dairy farm that has a lot of excess

776
00:34:33,039 --> 00:34:38,719
nutrients then uh that builds up the

777
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:41,800
phosphorus or we also see it sometimes

778
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:44,039
uh with uh uh you know repeated compost

779
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:47,560
applications sometimes with with even

780
00:34:44,039 --> 00:34:50,159
with Organic Farms um because uh both

781
00:34:47,559 --> 00:34:52,078
manure and compost are not as well

782
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:54,760
balanced in terms of nitrogen and

783
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:57,880
phosphorus uh that is that uh you

784
00:34:54,760 --> 00:35:01,119
typically uh apply too much phosphorus

785
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:03,680
for what the crop needs if you apply the

786
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:05,880
right amount of nitrogen so you do this

787
00:35:03,679 --> 00:35:08,239
year after year and then you start to

788
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:12,000
build up your phosphorus levels so these

789
00:35:08,239 --> 00:35:14,239
are some some real uh Cal samples of um

790
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:18,400
cases where there's been an increasing

791
00:35:14,239 --> 00:35:21,239
amount of organic uh phosphorus applied

792
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:26,200
and uh these are then for mic or for

793
00:35:21,239 --> 00:35:28,000
margar the um the F the soal test levels

794
00:35:26,199 --> 00:35:31,439
and you can see that they really build

795
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:32,960
up and they are really highly excessive

796
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:35,920
which is really what we would like to

797
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:37,559
like to prevent from happening so uh if

798
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:39,800
you have a situation like that when you

799
00:35:37,559 --> 00:35:42,480
have too much phosphorus in the soil

800
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:45,039
then you need to um to make sure that

801
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:47,760
you uh that you change the the diet you

802
00:35:45,039 --> 00:35:50,358
might say of of the soil where you add

803
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:53,119
your nitrogen in in a different way

804
00:35:50,358 --> 00:35:59,039
perhaps you can do that by adding say

805
00:35:53,119 --> 00:36:01,440
Clover um residues or or Alfalfa or or a

806
00:35:59,039 --> 00:36:04,239
um if you're not an organic grower then

807
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:06,559
perhaps you can simply apply some

808
00:36:04,239 --> 00:36:09,318
nitrogen fertilizer and a smaller amount

809
00:36:06,559 --> 00:36:11,519
of compost so that uh that you can start

810
00:36:09,318 --> 00:36:13,679
reducing those phosphorus levels in in

811
00:36:11,519 --> 00:36:13,679
the

812
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:19,160
soil so and we account for that in the

813
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:21,119
cornal Cal Health test in in terms of

814
00:36:19,159 --> 00:36:23,920
the scoring curve that we use for

815
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:26,680
phosphorus analysis and uh that was

816
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:28,159
discussed in in the previous webinars by

817
00:36:26,679 --> 00:36:30,239
Bob schindelbeck

818
00:36:28,159 --> 00:36:34,159
so the scoring curve basically the idea

819
00:36:30,239 --> 00:36:37,239
is that we uh we interpret an actually

820
00:36:34,159 --> 00:36:40,440
measured value of a soal health

821
00:36:37,239 --> 00:36:42,639
indicator in this case phosphorus and uh

822
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:46,039
we interpret that in on a scale from

823
00:36:42,639 --> 00:36:48,960
basically 0 to 100 so if we have very

824
00:36:46,039 --> 00:36:50,119
low phosphorus levels then uh we give it

825
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:53,000
a very low

826
00:36:50,119 --> 00:36:55,200
score and uh as the phosphorous level

827
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:58,159
increased then we increase the score as

828
00:36:55,199 --> 00:37:01,480
well so and this is then where we around

829
00:36:58,159 --> 00:37:05,000
four to six where we reach the optimum

830
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:07,280
level but then we start to downcore it

831
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:10,358
basically uh when we start to reach

832
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:12,760
excessive levels of phosphorus so uh it

833
00:37:10,358 --> 00:37:14,400
is important that uh that you try to

834
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:17,560
keep your phosphorus level sort of in

835
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:21,960
this Optimum range so sort of between

836
00:37:17,559 --> 00:37:25,799
about four or five and about 20 and that

837
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:25,800
you don't want to go into excessive

838
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:32,318
levels so to summarize uh the phosphorus

839
00:37:29,838 --> 00:37:35,519
management what are the main strategies

840
00:37:32,318 --> 00:37:38,199
well the first four that we see here are

841
00:37:35,519 --> 00:37:40,920
the same as we used for runoff and

842
00:37:38,199 --> 00:37:42,919
erosion prevention okay uh because if

843
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:45,920
you don't get any runoff then you don't

844
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:48,519
have any any problems with losses so the

845
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:50,760
same one avoid High flooding locations

846
00:37:48,519 --> 00:37:53,719
keep the soil covered maintain soil

847
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:56,079
health and maintain grass Alleyways but

848
00:37:53,719 --> 00:37:58,399
now we have this fifth consideration is

849
00:37:56,079 --> 00:38:00,720
monitor the soil phosphorus levels and

850
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:03,680
try to avoid excessive

851
00:38:00,719 --> 00:38:05,919
phosphorus so these five uh management

852
00:38:03,679 --> 00:38:09,239
strategies uh are very effective in

853
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:09,240
reducing P

854
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:13,640
losses Okay so we've talked about

855
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:15,760
erosion we've talked about phosphorus

856
00:38:13,639 --> 00:38:18,078
now let's talk about nitrogen and

857
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:19,880
nitrogen is a very kind of complex

858
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:23,200
element in in in the

859
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:25,640
soil um and both in terms of how it

860
00:38:23,199 --> 00:38:28,598
behaves in the soil but also in terms of

861
00:38:25,639 --> 00:38:30,799
the larger um considerations around

862
00:38:28,599 --> 00:38:32,640
nitrogen and there's a there's a number

863
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:35,000
of concerns that we have about around

864
00:38:32,639 --> 00:38:36,440
nitrogen these days one is the is the

865
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:39,159
high energy consumption that's

866
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:41,720
associated with the habos process that

867
00:38:39,159 --> 00:38:45,719
basically is the industrial process that

868
00:38:41,719 --> 00:38:48,318
takes atmospheric nitrogen to reactive

869
00:38:45,719 --> 00:38:51,000
nitrogen um it requires a lot of uh

870
00:38:48,318 --> 00:38:53,318
natural gas a lot of energy and it

871
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:56,960
generates a lot of carbon

872
00:38:53,318 --> 00:38:59,039
dioxide secondly you know we have a a

873
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:01,400
persistent concern about groundwater

874
00:38:59,039 --> 00:39:03,358
nitrate levels we haven't really seen a

875
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:05,160
lot of improvement in general over the

876
00:39:03,358 --> 00:39:07,880
past couple of decades in in nitrate

877
00:39:05,159 --> 00:39:09,879
levels which is the result of excessive

878
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:13,039
nitrogen applications especially in

879
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:15,440
these more Sandy areas or even urban

880
00:39:13,039 --> 00:39:18,838
areas the other one that we're concerned

881
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:21,720
about is is the losses of nitrogen uh

882
00:39:18,838 --> 00:39:24,440
into streams and rivers and then into

883
00:39:21,719 --> 00:39:28,519
estuaries and this map here on the

884
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:30,519
bottom shows the the about 300 locations

885
00:39:28,519 --> 00:39:33,880
around the world where there are a lot

886
00:39:30,519 --> 00:39:37,679
of concerns with uh High uh levels of

887
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:39,960
nitrogen in estuaries causing uh hypoxia

888
00:39:37,679 --> 00:39:42,719
or low oxygen levels and fish kills and

889
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:44,519
all that uh one area that's really quite

890
00:39:42,719 --> 00:39:46,318
well known is is Northwestern Europe

891
00:39:44,519 --> 00:39:49,759
where there's a lot of nitrogen use a

892
00:39:46,318 --> 00:39:51,639
lot of intensive uh dairying this is the

893
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:53,839
original area of where where the dairy

894
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:56,559
systems were developed and then of

895
00:39:53,838 --> 00:39:58,639
course on in North America uh the area

896
00:39:56,559 --> 00:40:01,078
along the east Co Coast starting sort of

897
00:39:58,639 --> 00:40:04,039
with Southern New England uh going down

898
00:40:01,079 --> 00:40:06,359
to Florida and then of course along uh

899
00:40:04,039 --> 00:40:09,279
the Gulf Coast where we have probably

900
00:40:06,358 --> 00:40:10,639
the largest problem as a result of all

901
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:12,880
the nitrogen that comes out of the

902
00:40:10,639 --> 00:40:15,358
Mississippi River Basin primarily

903
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:18,240
associated with uh with corn

904
00:40:15,358 --> 00:40:20,639
production um but these are uh often

905
00:40:18,239 --> 00:40:23,479
very important estuaries uh like for

906
00:40:20,639 --> 00:40:25,279
example the bonic Bay on Long Island uh

907
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:27,880
where there's a lot of concern even from

908
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:29,720
Horticultural Farms about trying to

909
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:32,760
reduce nitrogen

910
00:40:29,719 --> 00:40:35,519
losses so the fourth area of concern is

911
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:39,119
is greenhouse gases uh primarily nitrous

912
00:40:35,519 --> 00:40:41,800
oxide n2o which is the result of

913
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:44,358
denitrification and uh again Berry

914
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:47,240
production may not be a huge contributor

915
00:40:44,358 --> 00:40:49,598
uh but uh agriculture overall has a very

916
00:40:47,239 --> 00:40:51,879
large footprint in terms of of

917
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:54,880
greenhouse gas impact uh actually very

918
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:58,720
disproportionate to the uh share of the

919
00:40:54,880 --> 00:41:00,800
gross domestic product about 7 to 8% of

920
00:40:58,719 --> 00:41:03,318
greenhouse gases are associated with

921
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:05,880
Agriculture and most of that is nitrous

922
00:41:03,318 --> 00:41:08,559
oxide losses because nitrous oxide is

923
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:11,920
about 300 times more potent than carbon

924
00:41:08,559 --> 00:41:14,159
dioxide and um and so we need to try to

925
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:16,800
reduce that through prudent and

926
00:41:14,159 --> 00:41:19,598
judicious nitrogen

927
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:22,318
management so let's go to our pictograph

928
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:24,920
here about about nitrogen again crop

929
00:41:22,318 --> 00:41:28,159
uptake is desirable we may have a little

930
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:30,240
runoff and erosion uh but most of the

931
00:41:28,159 --> 00:41:32,480
losses will be leeching or

932
00:41:30,239 --> 00:41:34,759
denitrification if we have you know a

933
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:36,960
more sandy grally soil most of it will

934
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:39,599
be through leeching and this is as

935
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:41,679
nitrate because nitrate is negatively

936
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:44,000
charged and the soil is negatively

937
00:41:41,679 --> 00:41:47,159
charged as well so therefore it very

938
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:49,480
easily percolates down and washes down

939
00:41:47,159 --> 00:41:53,199
with uh with the with the water in the

940
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:57,960
soil the uh volatilization and

941
00:41:53,199 --> 00:42:00,480
denitrification losses are primarily um

942
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:02,679
uh N2 which is the nitrogen gas that's

943
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:05,920
also in the atmosphere which is not at

944
00:42:02,679 --> 00:42:08,879
all a concern uh because 78% of the

945
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:11,280
atmosphere is already D nitrogen gas uh

946
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:13,400
but it's the nitrous oxide that's the

947
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:15,680
primary concern now when we have a

948
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:18,920
denitrification event from say a heavy

949
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:21,838
rain we may actually lose quite a bit of

950
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:25,318
of of of nitrogen we may easily use 30

951
00:42:21,838 --> 00:42:27,440
40 pounds of nitrogen uh per acre uh

952
00:42:25,318 --> 00:42:29,880
either through the nitrification or to

953
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:31,639
leeching with a a heavy rainfall event

954
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:33,680
of say an inch and a

955
00:42:31,639 --> 00:42:36,358
half the other component that I should

956
00:42:33,679 --> 00:42:39,440
mention is volatilization of ammonia

957
00:42:36,358 --> 00:42:41,598
that is is also a concern primarily with

958
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:41,599
uh

959
00:42:43,838 --> 00:42:49,599
acidification so the the the nitogen

960
00:42:46,599 --> 00:42:51,920
cycle of course is is relatively complex

961
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:53,318
and I won't go into detail about that

962
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:56,079
it's I think the main point is that

963
00:42:53,318 --> 00:42:59,318
there's a lot of these uh these

964
00:42:56,079 --> 00:43:01,599
Transformations that occur in the soil

965
00:42:59,318 --> 00:43:03,880
that are in part driven by all these

966
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:07,160
sources of nitrogen that come you know

967
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:09,119
from Agriculture and uh when it moves

968
00:43:07,159 --> 00:43:11,078
from one state to the other state it may

969
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:14,000
be become subject to leeching or

970
00:43:11,079 --> 00:43:15,720
denitrification and gaseous losses and

971
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:20,079
and all that so I'm going to simplify

972
00:43:15,719 --> 00:43:22,318
that by uh using this graph here so this

973
00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:24,440
uh First shows the sources of soil

974
00:43:22,318 --> 00:43:26,558
nitrogen one of them is we get a little

975
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:29,920
bit of nitrogen from the atmosphere

976
00:43:26,559 --> 00:43:32,079
typically about about maybe 6 or 8 lbs

977
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:36,039
per acre it's free nitrogen basically

978
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:38,880
but a relatively small quantity in most

979
00:43:36,039 --> 00:43:41,440
uh field conditions we get a significant

980
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:44,119
amount of the nitrogen from uh the the

981
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:46,960
mineralization or the basically the

982
00:43:44,119 --> 00:43:49,880
decomposition of uh soil organic matter

983
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:51,440
that may be native in the soil uh other

984
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:55,760
organic materials that may have been

985
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:58,720
applied like manure or compost or uh

986
00:43:55,760 --> 00:44:00,760
residues um and then uh cover crops

987
00:43:58,719 --> 00:44:04,879
especially leguminous cover crops like

988
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:07,599
Clover or alphalpha and these all get uh

989
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:11,400
get decomposed and the organic nitrogen

990
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:14,800
is mineralized to inorganic nitrogen uh

991
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:17,318
primarily as a result of uh of uh uh you

992
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:19,680
know biologically biological processes

993
00:44:17,318 --> 00:44:21,759
which are in turn affected by

994
00:44:19,679 --> 00:44:23,519
temperature the other source of nitrogen

995
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:26,200
of course is is mineral nitrogen which

996
00:44:23,519 --> 00:44:29,239
is uh which is fertilizer it could be

997
00:44:26,199 --> 00:44:32,439
ammonia type fertilizers it could be uh

998
00:44:29,239 --> 00:44:32,439
nitrate type

999
00:44:34,318 --> 00:44:38,358
fertilizers so we have all these

1000
00:44:36,239 --> 00:44:40,598
different sources uh of variation that

1001
00:44:38,358 --> 00:44:42,679
are associated with nitrogen

1002
00:44:40,599 --> 00:44:45,200
availability um and that makes it

1003
00:44:42,679 --> 00:44:48,799
actually a little bit more difficult to

1004
00:44:45,199 --> 00:44:51,159
manage nitrogen uh we uh different soil

1005
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:53,519
types have different uh sources uh if

1006
00:44:51,159 --> 00:44:55,399
you're looking at the midwestern soil uh

1007
00:44:53,519 --> 00:44:58,318
they have a lot of organic matter and

1008
00:44:55,400 --> 00:45:01,200
it's very deep and they have um have

1009
00:44:58,318 --> 00:45:04,318
good structure they provide a lot more

1010
00:45:01,199 --> 00:45:07,799
nitrogen than say a uh a a soil in the

1011
00:45:04,318 --> 00:45:10,119
Northeast that's very Sandy and um a pot

1012
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:12,079
soil type uh type soil that has

1013
00:45:10,119 --> 00:45:13,358
relatively little organic matter and

1014
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:15,359
nitrogen

1015
00:45:13,358 --> 00:45:17,480
mineralization of course the amount of

1016
00:45:15,358 --> 00:45:19,480
organic matter in the soil uh affects

1017
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:21,920
the nitrogen availability and we have

1018
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:24,519
seen soils you know build up organic

1019
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:27,119
matter when they're very well managed or

1020
00:45:24,519 --> 00:45:29,800
lose organic matter when they are say

1021
00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:32,200
have a history of intensive tillage or

1022
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:34,160
erosion of course how much you add in

1023
00:45:32,199 --> 00:45:36,480
addition in terms of organic amendments

1024
00:45:34,159 --> 00:45:38,239
like compost and Manor whether you have

1025
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:41,519
cover crops and what types of cover

1026
00:45:38,239 --> 00:45:44,318
crops leguminous versus uh grass cover

1027
00:45:41,519 --> 00:45:46,440
crops for example uh soil and crop

1028
00:45:44,318 --> 00:45:49,079
management you know how intensively you

1029
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:51,559
till and things like that uh whether you

1030
00:45:49,079 --> 00:45:53,680
have drainage or not and if you have

1031
00:45:51,559 --> 00:45:56,000
poor drainage then you may get a lot of

1032
00:45:53,679 --> 00:45:57,879
uh losses especially of nitrogen

1033
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:01,000
temperature is a factor

1034
00:45:57,880 --> 00:46:02,920
because a lot of the mineralization is

1035
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:04,800
temperature mediated because it's a

1036
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:06,599
biological process and then of course

1037
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:09,640
last but not least

1038
00:46:06,599 --> 00:46:12,800
precipitation um because uh a soil

1039
00:46:09,639 --> 00:46:14,799
that's say very dry will not uh

1040
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:16,400
mineralize nitrogen or soil that's too

1041
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:19,240
wet won't mineralize

1042
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:21,318
nitrogen and uh all these things in a

1043
00:46:19,239 --> 00:46:23,679
way interact in very complex ways and

1044
00:46:21,318 --> 00:46:26,358
that's what makes it very difficult to

1045
00:46:23,679 --> 00:46:28,799
precisely predict how much nitrogen uh

1046
00:46:26,358 --> 00:46:30,759
needs to be added to your soil to

1047
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:33,400
adequately feed the crop but there are

1048
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:36,680
really some some guidelines that we have

1049
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:39,559
if we understand the system a little bit

1050
00:46:36,679 --> 00:46:41,799
better um so this is this picture here

1051
00:46:39,559 --> 00:46:43,880
shows the the nitrogen

1052
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:45,880
mineralization uh as part of the

1053
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:49,000
incubation time this is from an an

1054
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:52,079
earlier paper by cman and

1055
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:54,440
muns and what it shows you here uh that

1056
00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:57,680
the most of the nitrogen comes from the

1057
00:46:54,440 --> 00:47:01,200
surface soil this is the 0 to8 18 cm

1058
00:46:57,679 --> 00:47:04,279
which about uh 0 to 7

1059
00:47:01,199 --> 00:47:06,639
in and we see the uh an increasing

1060
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:09,240
amount of nit being mineralized over

1061
00:47:06,639 --> 00:47:12,039
incubation time up to 100 days this is

1062
00:47:09,239 --> 00:47:14,039
the square root it's 100 days and then

1063
00:47:12,039 --> 00:47:16,639
we see that as we go deeper into the

1064
00:47:14,039 --> 00:47:18,920
soil less and less nitrogen is

1065
00:47:16,639 --> 00:47:20,920
mineralized and becomes available so

1066
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:23,720
it's the surface soil that's the most

1067
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:24,599
important that provides the majority of

1068
00:47:23,719 --> 00:47:27,199
the

1069
00:47:24,599 --> 00:47:28,680
nitrogen so in the field this is a

1070
00:47:27,199 --> 00:47:30,879
laboratory study but in the field

1071
00:47:28,679 --> 00:47:33,118
nitrogen release will be affected by

1072
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:37,960
weather conditions like temperature uh

1073
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:37,960
soil organic minor content so types uh

1074
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:43,920
Etc so let's now consider the the losses

1075
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:46,358
so we looked at the sources of N and

1076
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:49,039
these are the primary losses one of them

1077
00:47:46,358 --> 00:47:52,318
is is ammonia volatilization and that

1078
00:47:49,039 --> 00:47:54,719
can be the result of of um uh the

1079
00:47:52,318 --> 00:47:56,519
application of ammonia type fertilizers

1080
00:47:54,719 --> 00:47:59,000
especially if they're left right at the

1081
00:47:56,519 --> 00:48:01,318
C surface so that they can

1082
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:03,239
volatilize and you can reduce that by

1083
00:48:01,318 --> 00:48:04,639
basically incorporating it or injecting

1084
00:48:03,239 --> 00:48:08,159
it into the

1085
00:48:04,639 --> 00:48:10,118
soil uh also manure can often have

1086
00:48:08,159 --> 00:48:12,358
ammonia fertilization so if you apply

1087
00:48:10,119 --> 00:48:14,200
manure even some compost and you leave

1088
00:48:12,358 --> 00:48:16,679
it on the surface then you might lose

1089
00:48:14,199 --> 00:48:18,759
some of that through

1090
00:48:16,679 --> 00:48:21,118
volatilization uh we talked a little bit

1091
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:23,319
about runoff and erosion tends to be not

1092
00:48:21,119 --> 00:48:26,000
that big of a problem the primary losses

1093
00:48:23,318 --> 00:48:27,400
of ntion from runoff and erosion is when

1094
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:30,318
you leave

1095
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:32,440
the uh organic or inorganic surf uh

1096
00:48:30,318 --> 00:48:35,400
fertilizer on the surface and it gets

1097
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:38,119
gets removed in a heavy rainfall

1098
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:40,318
event um the other losses the major

1099
00:48:38,119 --> 00:48:43,559
losses are denitrification and nitrate

1100
00:48:40,318 --> 00:48:45,759
leeching as we as we mentioned again the

1101
00:48:43,559 --> 00:48:48,599
primary objective of course remains

1102
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:51,920
getting the nitrogen into the

1103
00:48:48,599 --> 00:48:54,359
crop um so again it's management soil

1104
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:57,079
Health precipitation and temperature

1105
00:48:54,358 --> 00:48:59,679
that are all critical factors in terms

1106
00:48:57,079 --> 00:49:01,160
of the losses it's always if you get a

1107
00:48:59,679 --> 00:49:03,358
lot of water you get a lot of

1108
00:49:01,159 --> 00:49:05,318
precipitation that creates most of the

1109
00:49:03,358 --> 00:49:08,159
problems that can create the leeching

1110
00:49:05,318 --> 00:49:11,119
the nitrification is affected by both

1111
00:49:08,159 --> 00:49:13,798
precipitation and by temperature because

1112
00:49:11,119 --> 00:49:16,079
it's an indirect loss and it's a

1113
00:49:13,798 --> 00:49:18,119
biologically mediated loss so if you

1114
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:20,000
have actually very cold soil you may

1115
00:49:18,119 --> 00:49:22,200
have quite a bit of nitrogen in that

1116
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:25,119
soil um but you won't get much

1117
00:49:22,199 --> 00:49:27,838
denitrification losses because uh the

1118
00:49:25,119 --> 00:49:30,240
soil is cold and the boss iCal activity

1119
00:49:27,838 --> 00:49:33,239
is low so when you really do see a lot

1120
00:49:30,239 --> 00:49:35,000
of denitrification losses is is sort of

1121
00:49:33,239 --> 00:49:37,199
you know a little bit further into the

1122
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:40,159
growing season when the soil has become

1123
00:49:37,199 --> 00:49:42,919
warm and then you got a lot of rain and

1124
00:49:40,159 --> 00:49:46,759
you can lose easily 30 to 50 pounds per

1125
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:48,720
acre in a heavy rainfall event and so in

1126
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:49,720
a way you'd like to be able to account

1127
00:49:48,719 --> 00:49:53,118
for

1128
00:49:49,719 --> 00:49:56,439
that so when we go back to our basic

1129
00:49:53,119 --> 00:49:59,640
properties in terms of pore sizes um we

1130
00:49:56,440 --> 00:50:03,760
can think of the loss potential again in

1131
00:49:59,639 --> 00:50:07,039
terms of large pores uh good ation so it

1132
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:10,240
reduces denitrification losses small

1133
00:50:07,039 --> 00:50:13,199
pores reduces leeching losses and

1134
00:50:10,239 --> 00:50:16,199
ideally you have some of both because

1135
00:50:13,199 --> 00:50:20,639
that provides a well balanced soil which

1136
00:50:16,199 --> 00:50:20,639
you tend to get from a well aggregated

1137
00:50:22,039 --> 00:50:28,599
soil another uh concern related to nen

1138
00:50:25,519 --> 00:50:31,519
is is poor internal drainage um so if

1139
00:50:28,599 --> 00:50:35,119
you uh have uh barriers deep in the soil

1140
00:50:31,519 --> 00:50:37,759
and you have uh water tables that are um

1141
00:50:35,119 --> 00:50:40,280
at um you know relatively shallow depths

1142
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:43,119
that promotes of course denitrification

1143
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:46,079
losses you can remediate that through

1144
00:50:43,119 --> 00:50:48,838
insulation of subsurface drain lines and

1145
00:50:46,079 --> 00:50:52,000
of course uh race beds also reduce the

1146
00:50:48,838 --> 00:50:53,759
susceptibility to imperfect drainage so

1147
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:56,960
it's an it's an component that's often

1148
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:58,799
forgotten but um you know poor drainage

1149
00:50:56,960 --> 00:51:00,960
creates uh problems especially with

1150
00:50:58,798 --> 00:51:04,239
nitrogen losses but even with runoff and

1151
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:06,639
erosion and phosphorus losses because uh

1152
00:51:04,239 --> 00:51:08,798
CS that have poor drainage tend to have

1153
00:51:06,639 --> 00:51:12,159
higher potential for runoff because the

1154
00:51:08,798 --> 00:51:14,159
soil remains wet and

1155
00:51:12,159 --> 00:51:16,639
saturated so what are the main

1156
00:51:14,159 --> 00:51:19,519
strategies then for reducing nitrogen

1157
00:51:16,639 --> 00:51:21,279
losses do not over apply nitrogen by

1158
00:51:19,519 --> 00:51:23,280
accounting for all sources of nitrogen

1159
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:27,680
inputs like the soil organic matter

1160
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:30,040
compost manure fertilizer Etc

1161
00:51:27,679 --> 00:51:32,159
ideally provide nitrogen in multiple

1162
00:51:30,039 --> 00:51:34,798
applications and account for weather

1163
00:51:32,159 --> 00:51:36,318
factors we're actually uh on the

1164
00:51:34,798 --> 00:51:39,199
scientific front making a lot of

1165
00:51:36,318 --> 00:51:43,039
progress in this area we now have for uh

1166
00:51:39,199 --> 00:51:45,078
field corn and sweet corn we have a tool

1167
00:51:43,039 --> 00:51:48,039
that we developed the adapt end tool

1168
00:51:45,079 --> 00:51:50,359
that allows for um for prediction of how

1169
00:51:48,039 --> 00:51:52,558
much nitrogen he needs using model

1170
00:51:50,358 --> 00:51:55,159
simulations accounting for all these

1171
00:51:52,559 --> 00:51:58,720
weather effects that we discussed uh but

1172
00:51:55,159 --> 00:52:00,519
I think for uh uh for uh even for Berry

1173
00:51:58,719 --> 00:52:03,358
producers where you may not have a tool

1174
00:52:00,519 --> 00:52:07,519
like that uh you can have basic rules

1175
00:52:03,358 --> 00:52:09,838
rules of of thumb if you have um say a

1176
00:52:07,519 --> 00:52:11,798
very wet spring then you probably lost

1177
00:52:09,838 --> 00:52:14,639
some of that nitrogen through

1178
00:52:11,798 --> 00:52:16,480
denitrification and leeching depending

1179
00:52:14,639 --> 00:52:18,558
on your soil type and you may need to

1180
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:20,760
make up for that and apply a little bit

1181
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:22,960
of extra nitrogen say in your second

1182
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:24,760
application but if you have a relatively

1183
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:27,039
dry spring you may want to do the

1184
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:30,079
opposite uh because you didn't have any

1185
00:52:27,039 --> 00:52:33,318
losses so you don't want to over apply

1186
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:36,720
so you can uh can even you know without

1187
00:52:33,318 --> 00:52:38,960
really using sophisticated sophisticated

1188
00:52:36,719 --> 00:52:42,480
methods you can make some adjustments to

1189
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:44,880
your nitrogen based on the weather

1190
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:47,199
conditions uh next one build and

1191
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:50,079
maintain soil Health aggregation organic

1192
00:52:47,199 --> 00:52:51,919
matter Etc uh that especially on the

1193
00:52:50,079 --> 00:52:54,039
medium Define textured soils will help

1194
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:56,119
with irration and with water and

1195
00:52:54,039 --> 00:52:57,358
nutrient uh retention so soil Health

1196
00:52:56,119 --> 00:53:00,280
Management

1197
00:52:57,358 --> 00:53:02,279
um again it's important not only from a

1198
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:05,240
production perspective but also in terms

1199
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:07,480
of reducing the environmental losses and

1200
00:53:05,239 --> 00:53:09,279
then finally as I mentioned facilitate

1201
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:12,280
good

1202
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:14,798
drainage um so I wanted to to show you

1203
00:53:12,280 --> 00:53:17,359
um these two soil Health

1204
00:53:14,798 --> 00:53:19,679
reports and uh to look at that sort of

1205
00:53:17,358 --> 00:53:22,400
in the context of the environmental loss

1206
00:53:19,679 --> 00:53:26,519
potential so these are two very similar

1207
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:28,280
soils but one had a history uh of uh no

1208
00:53:26,519 --> 00:53:32,159
manure inputs and the other one had a

1209
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:34,599
history with manure inputs and uh even

1210
00:53:32,159 --> 00:53:36,440
though these soils inherently are are

1211
00:53:34,599 --> 00:53:38,440
very similar they're medium textured

1212
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:40,519
soils you can see that the aggregate

1213
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:44,119
stability without manure was

1214
00:53:40,519 --> 00:53:46,798
53% but it became 78% with multiple

1215
00:53:44,119 --> 00:53:49,640
manure inputs so we have actually uh

1216
00:53:46,798 --> 00:53:52,000
make the soil more made the soil more

1217
00:53:49,639 --> 00:53:55,239
desirable by allowing for better

1218
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:57,920
irration reduced um reduced potential

1219
00:53:55,239 --> 00:54:02,199
for denitrification l mes the available

1220
00:53:57,920 --> 00:54:04,400
water capacity went from uh 0.1 to. 26

1221
00:54:02,199 --> 00:54:05,480
so we've increased the ability of the

1222
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:08,519
soil to

1223
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:11,240
retain the nutrients as well so we've

1224
00:54:08,519 --> 00:54:13,639
both uh reduced the denitrification

1225
00:54:11,239 --> 00:54:15,318
losses in principle and we've reduced

1226
00:54:13,639 --> 00:54:17,598
the leeching losses because we have

1227
00:54:15,318 --> 00:54:19,880
better water and nutrient

1228
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:23,280
retention also notice that the organic

1229
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:25,400
matter content without manure was 2.6

1230
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:27,720
and with manure it's been built up to

1231
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:30,639
over six%

1232
00:54:27,719 --> 00:54:33,399
so that has a lot of benefits uh similar

1233
00:54:30,639 --> 00:54:35,159
with the active carbon and potentially

1234
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:37,280
mineralizable nitrogen that's an

1235
00:54:35,159 --> 00:54:39,078
indicator of the amount of nitrogen that

1236
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:41,400
we can expect from

1237
00:54:39,079 --> 00:54:42,519
mineralization that went from about six

1238
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:45,680
to about

1239
00:54:42,519 --> 00:54:48,039
203 and so this uh this soil on the

1240
00:54:45,679 --> 00:54:50,960
right of course can provide a lot more

1241
00:54:48,039 --> 00:54:53,838
nitrogen from natural sources than the

1242
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:55,798
one on the left so all in all the one on

1243
00:54:53,838 --> 00:54:59,558
the right with the manure inputs is of

1244
00:54:55,798 --> 00:55:02,280
higher Health higher quality and uh and

1245
00:54:59,559 --> 00:55:03,680
presumably reduced environmental input

1246
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:06,160
uh

1247
00:55:03,679 --> 00:55:08,078
impacts okay so this is then my last

1248
00:55:06,159 --> 00:55:09,798
slide where I want to put everything

1249
00:55:08,079 --> 00:55:11,039
together that we've discussed in the

1250
00:55:09,798 --> 00:55:13,679
past

1251
00:55:11,039 --> 00:55:15,880
hour um and I think first and foremost

1252
00:55:13,679 --> 00:55:17,558
most Berry production systems have low

1253
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:19,440
environmental impacts from nutrients and

1254
00:55:17,559 --> 00:55:22,079
sediments and part of that is because

1255
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:23,519
they uh that is inherent with the

1256
00:55:22,079 --> 00:55:26,839
production practice and the fact that

1257
00:55:23,519 --> 00:55:28,759
you're using a a perennial plant so

1258
00:55:26,838 --> 00:55:31,000
there's not a lot of tillage going on

1259
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:33,039
there's not very large amounts of

1260
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:35,760
nutrients that normally get uh get

1261
00:55:33,039 --> 00:55:37,559
applied and so it's not as big of a

1262
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:40,400
concern as perhaps you know corn

1263
00:55:37,559 --> 00:55:42,798
production or some of these other major

1264
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:45,720
crops side characteristics like soil

1265
00:55:42,798 --> 00:55:48,038
type location Etc can affect potential

1266
00:55:45,719 --> 00:55:49,719
losses like for example when you're on a

1267
00:55:48,039 --> 00:55:53,880
flood plane or whether you have very

1268
00:55:49,719 --> 00:55:55,879
clay soils um and uh you know naturally

1269
00:55:53,880 --> 00:55:57,119
soils that have high runoff and erosion

1270
00:55:55,880 --> 00:55:59,920
potential

1271
00:55:57,119 --> 00:56:03,640
in addition to that through management

1272
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:05,960
we can increase or decrease the um

1273
00:56:03,639 --> 00:56:08,598
potential for these losses leeching or

1274
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:10,679
runoff and erosion so when we build up

1275
00:56:08,599 --> 00:56:13,119
the soil uh through good soil Health

1276
00:56:10,679 --> 00:56:15,199
Management we can increase productivity

1277
00:56:13,119 --> 00:56:16,720
and reduce the environmental impact so

1278
00:56:15,199 --> 00:56:19,239
it's a win-win

1279
00:56:16,719 --> 00:56:21,118
situation and then in addition we need

1280
00:56:19,239 --> 00:56:22,959
to make sure that we don't put too many

1281
00:56:21,119 --> 00:56:25,440
nutrients out there that we that we that

1282
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:27,798
we are careful about what we apply so

1283
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:30,079
prudent nutrient management can prevent

1284
00:56:27,798 --> 00:56:33,519
most of these

1285
00:56:30,079 --> 00:56:36,640
losses and with that I will hand it over

1286
00:56:33,519 --> 00:56:39,239
or back to Laura to our moderator and uh

1287
00:56:36,639 --> 00:56:42,239
be happy to entertain

1288
00:56:39,239 --> 00:56:45,879
questions thank you Harold um I know

1289
00:56:42,239 --> 00:56:47,598
that Tom has a question about whether or

1290
00:56:45,880 --> 00:56:50,599
not the soil Health test that you showed

1291
00:56:47,599 --> 00:56:53,640
second to the last slide was with manure

1292
00:56:50,599 --> 00:56:55,960
from a corn silage field and then I

1293
00:56:53,639 --> 00:56:58,920
actually had some questions about that

1294
00:56:55,960 --> 00:57:01,199
um same slide so I don't know would it

1295
00:56:58,920 --> 00:57:06,318
be possible to go back to that yes we

1296
00:57:01,199 --> 00:57:08,199
can go back to that um yes I mean the uh

1297
00:57:06,318 --> 00:57:10,239
the the the soil on the on the right

1298
00:57:08,199 --> 00:57:14,118
there they were both soils that were in

1299
00:57:10,239 --> 00:57:16,038
corn production and uh the one on the on

1300
00:57:14,119 --> 00:57:18,400
the left was primarily corn for grain

1301
00:57:16,039 --> 00:57:20,559
and the one on the right was uh part of

1302
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:22,559
a dairy system so it was corn silage

1303
00:57:20,559 --> 00:57:24,079
with manure

1304
00:57:22,559 --> 00:57:26,400
inputs

1305
00:57:24,079 --> 00:57:28,640
okay um hopefully that answer here's

1306
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:30,519
Tom's question and my question may be a

1307
00:57:28,639 --> 00:57:33,960
little bit off topic from the Barry

1308
00:57:30,519 --> 00:57:36,639
example but I'm I'm just wondering about

1309
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:38,240
the um root health rating I struggle a

1310
00:57:36,639 --> 00:57:40,798
little bit with these soil Health tests

1311
00:57:38,239 --> 00:57:44,239
trying to understand what's happening

1312
00:57:40,798 --> 00:57:47,280
and definitely I can see the positive um

1313
00:57:44,239 --> 00:57:50,399
impact the manure has but why is the

1314
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:53,079
soil the root health rating lower do you

1315
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:55,079
think um I would have to go back to all

1316
00:57:53,079 --> 00:57:58,920
the details about the particular Farm

1317
00:57:55,079 --> 00:58:01,039
which I don't really have with me um uh

1318
00:57:58,920 --> 00:58:04,358
it probably has to do with with with

1319
00:58:01,039 --> 00:58:07,319
with the fact that the uh um the field

1320
00:58:04,358 --> 00:58:10,358
that was that received the manure inputs

1321
00:58:07,318 --> 00:58:14,880
uh also had rotations with Al Alpha and

1322
00:58:10,358 --> 00:58:16,880
we uh used the Bean bioassay for uh to

1323
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:20,599
look at the uh so let me just put the

1324
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:23,440
arrow there we use a bean bi bioassay so

1325
00:58:20,599 --> 00:58:27,440
uh which is also a legume so we may have

1326
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:29,400
increased the uh the the root uh disease

1327
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:31,639
pressure a little bit simply by the

1328
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:34,119
rotation it's typically the the the

1329
00:58:31,639 --> 00:58:36,159
rotation and the types of crops that are

1330
00:58:34,119 --> 00:58:38,880
part of the rotation that are the

1331
00:58:36,159 --> 00:58:42,558
primary concern uh but keep in mind that

1332
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:46,079
we use a uh uh for the root health uh

1333
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:48,920
rating we use a sensitive uh indicator

1334
00:58:46,079 --> 00:58:52,240
crop which is which is uh snap Bean

1335
00:58:48,920 --> 00:58:53,720
basically that um and that's what we use

1336
00:58:52,239 --> 00:58:56,159
in comparison now if you're if you're

1337
00:58:53,719 --> 00:58:58,078
not growing snap beans of course then

1338
00:58:56,159 --> 00:59:00,759
you need to understand that you know

1339
00:58:58,079 --> 00:59:03,318
your crop might have slightly different

1340
00:59:00,760 --> 00:59:05,799
susceptibility but we we selected snap

1341
00:59:03,318 --> 00:59:08,159
Bean because you know it is the best

1342
00:59:05,798 --> 00:59:10,079
indicator typically that you can use for

1343
00:59:08,159 --> 00:59:13,879
vegetable

1344
00:59:10,079 --> 00:59:15,240
production okay great thank you um it

1345
00:59:13,880 --> 00:59:18,280
looks like there's a couple of other

1346
00:59:15,239 --> 00:59:21,118
folks typing and maybe we can get some

1347
00:59:18,280 --> 00:59:21,119
other questions

1348
00:59:21,318 --> 00:59:26,639
here um Kathy wonders how long does the

1349
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:29,358
effect of a heavy downpour persist in

1350
00:59:26,639 --> 00:59:31,879
terms of nitrogen losses to soil is it

1351
00:59:29,358 --> 00:59:34,519
an hour or so after the event or a day

1352
00:59:31,880 --> 00:59:39,160
or more okay good good question that

1353
00:59:34,519 --> 00:59:40,400
Kathy um yeah so if you uh it it it

1354
00:59:39,159 --> 00:59:44,519
takes a little bit longer it takes

1355
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:46,960
several days um what um when we have a

1356
00:59:44,519 --> 00:59:50,400
more finer textured soils like a like a

1357
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:52,760
silt LOM down to a clay LOM you know

1358
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:54,318
when we get a lot of rainfall the soil

1359
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:57,319
becomes saturated and if it doesn't

1360
00:59:54,318 --> 01:00:00,000
drain well then uh the C remains

1361
00:59:57,318 --> 01:00:01,480
saturated and then it takes about 2 Days

1362
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:03,599
in fact we've done a lot of research on

1363
01:00:01,480 --> 01:00:08,559
that and taken a lot of measurements um

1364
01:00:03,599 --> 01:00:10,599
it takes about 48 to 72 hours then for

1365
01:00:08,559 --> 01:00:12,280
these Anor robic conditions to occur and

1366
01:00:10,599 --> 01:00:13,480
that's when you get most of the lossess

1367
01:00:12,280 --> 01:00:16,240
so it's not

1368
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:20,440
immediate because the soil needs to

1369
01:00:16,239 --> 01:00:24,199
remain saturated for about 2 days for

1370
01:00:20,440 --> 01:00:25,440
the E8 or the Redux potential to go down

1371
01:00:24,199 --> 01:00:26,598
and that's when you get most of the

1372
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:28,720
losses

1373
01:00:26,599 --> 01:00:31,960
and similarly with leeching losses it

1374
01:00:28,719 --> 01:00:34,399
takes about a day or so day or two for

1375
01:00:31,960 --> 01:00:37,318
the water to move down through the soil

1376
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:40,639
and then to wash out most of the

1377
01:00:37,318 --> 01:00:44,000
nitrogen I hope that answers your

1378
01:00:40,639 --> 01:00:46,159
question okay great and then um there is

1379
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:48,798
another question from Glenn he's

1380
01:00:46,159 --> 01:00:51,000
wondering if the additional traffic from

1381
01:00:48,798 --> 01:00:53,119
manure applications increased the

1382
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:55,400
surface and subsurface hardness I think

1383
01:00:53,119 --> 01:00:56,440
he's referring to that very slide that

1384
01:00:55,400 --> 01:00:59,798
right right

1385
01:00:56,440 --> 01:01:02,639
yes yeah absolutely and we we we do see

1386
01:00:59,798 --> 01:01:04,960
this a lot on on Dairy Farms where the

1387
01:01:02,639 --> 01:01:06,679
soal health indicators are all looking

1388
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:09,159
great you know it's all in the green and

1389
01:01:06,679 --> 01:01:11,759
the ratings are are very high in the 90s

1390
01:01:09,159 --> 01:01:14,480
and then we see that the hardness uh is

1391
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:17,280
typically uh uh the soil is very hard

1392
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:20,000
and and so the score is very low on that

1393
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:21,440
and that's because on on these uh fields

1394
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:24,159
that receive manure a lot of the manure

1395
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:26,519
gets applied with very heavy uh manure

1396
01:01:24,159 --> 01:01:28,519
spreaders uh often times under very

1397
01:01:26,519 --> 01:01:30,119
marginal conditions you know the the

1398
01:01:28,519 --> 01:01:32,159
farmers want to get to manure onto the

1399
01:01:30,119 --> 01:01:34,880
land early in the season because they

1400
01:01:32,159 --> 01:01:36,679
want to get to planting and so a lot of

1401
01:01:34,880 --> 01:01:38,640
these uh these soils actually show a lot

1402
01:01:36,679 --> 01:01:40,239
of compaction problems yeah that's very

1403
01:01:38,639 --> 01:01:44,159
observant of

1404
01:01:40,239 --> 01:01:46,239
you and then um again from Glenn he's

1405
01:01:44,159 --> 01:01:48,239
wondering if there's relationships

1406
01:01:46,239 --> 01:01:50,199
between temperature and precipitation

1407
01:01:48,239 --> 01:01:52,759
have been condensed into interpretive

1408
01:01:50,199 --> 01:01:55,239
Rules by which one could apply observed

1409
01:01:52,760 --> 01:01:56,960
and forecasted weather data into adapt

1410
01:01:55,239 --> 01:01:59,479
and recommend

1411
01:01:56,960 --> 01:02:02,119
ations uh let's see now I need I need to

1412
01:01:59,480 --> 01:02:03,838
look at that uh really quickly myself

1413
01:02:02,119 --> 01:02:07,000
should

1414
01:02:03,838 --> 01:02:10,358
I I've been condensed into interpretive

1415
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:13,039
forecast uh yes so um if you're

1416
01:02:10,358 --> 01:02:14,719
interested in in in adopt n uh I would

1417
01:02:13,039 --> 01:02:17,799
encourage you to just go to our website

1418
01:02:14,719 --> 01:02:22,038
if you just Google adapt n uh you will

1419
01:02:17,798 --> 01:02:25,880
get there um but the the adapt in system

1420
01:02:22,039 --> 01:02:27,559
is is basically uh it it involves a d

1421
01:02:25,880 --> 01:02:30,278
damic simulation model which which

1422
01:02:27,559 --> 01:02:31,680
simulates soil and crop processes like

1423
01:02:30,278 --> 01:02:34,400
water movement through the soil and

1424
01:02:31,679 --> 01:02:37,318
nitrogen transformation and it also

1425
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:39,559
accesses a highresolution uh weather

1426
01:02:37,318 --> 01:02:41,920
database that was developed here at the

1427
01:02:39,559 --> 01:02:44,079
Northeast climate center right here uh

1428
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:47,559
in in the same building where I am now

1429
01:02:44,079 --> 01:02:49,359
Bradfield Hall and so the adapt end Tool

1430
01:02:47,559 --> 01:02:50,760
uh basically simulates all these

1431
01:02:49,358 --> 01:02:53,598
conditions for the early part of the

1432
01:02:50,760 --> 01:02:54,839
growing season it estimates the uh

1433
01:02:53,599 --> 01:02:57,640
nitrogen additions through

1434
01:02:54,838 --> 01:02:59,599
mineralization and and all that and it

1435
01:02:57,639 --> 01:03:02,598
estimates the losses and then it comes

1436
01:02:59,599 --> 01:03:05,599
up with a recommendation for Sight

1437
01:03:02,599 --> 01:03:07,440
dressing in this case corn um in

1438
01:03:05,599 --> 01:03:10,160
principle you know we could also get

1439
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:11,960
into other crops uh so but that that's

1440
01:03:10,159 --> 01:03:13,679
what it does it's it's very Dynamic and

1441
01:03:11,960 --> 01:03:16,079
it takes all of those temperature and

1442
01:03:13,679 --> 01:03:19,558
precipitation factors into account and

1443
01:03:16,079 --> 01:03:21,839
it does it in a kind of a daily time

1444
01:03:19,559 --> 01:03:23,640
step okay and then there's a question

1445
01:03:21,838 --> 01:03:26,159
from Tom he's wondering if there's any

1446
01:03:23,639 --> 01:03:28,159
new research on remediating compact

1447
01:03:26,159 --> 01:03:31,278
mechanical ripping or biod drilling with

1448
01:03:28,159 --> 01:03:34,038
a deep rooted crop like forage radish or

1449
01:03:31,278 --> 01:03:35,798
alala uh well yeah Tom I mean those are

1450
01:03:34,039 --> 01:03:38,559
of course some of the uh some of the

1451
01:03:35,798 --> 01:03:43,318
things that more recently uh have have

1452
01:03:38,559 --> 01:03:45,559
been uh developed uh I I think the um

1453
01:03:43,318 --> 01:03:48,278
the the biod drilling is is is very

1454
01:03:45,559 --> 01:03:51,480
exciting this is um um for those of you

1455
01:03:48,278 --> 01:03:52,679
not familiar with it um Ray wild um at

1456
01:03:51,480 --> 01:03:56,480
the University of Maryland has done a

1457
01:03:52,679 --> 01:03:58,598
lot of work uh on that uh often in

1458
01:03:56,480 --> 01:04:00,760
collaboration with Steve gra who's a

1459
01:03:58,599 --> 01:04:03,960
very Progressive farmer in Southeastern

1460
01:04:00,760 --> 01:04:07,079
Pennsylvania uh the idea is to to use um

1461
01:04:03,960 --> 01:04:10,480
you know radishes especially you can

1462
01:04:07,079 --> 01:04:12,160
plant them in in September typically for

1463
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:15,920
uh most of the uh the areas that we're

1464
01:04:12,159 --> 01:04:18,440
concerned of and um and they uh they

1465
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:20,599
establish very strong and fat Roots I

1466
01:04:18,440 --> 01:04:22,519
mean they radishes and that basically

1467
01:04:20,599 --> 01:04:26,519
kind of loosens up the soil we call it

1468
01:04:22,519 --> 01:04:29,599
biod drilling um and um yeah so if you

1469
01:04:26,519 --> 01:04:31,559
have compaction uh the best way to

1470
01:04:29,599 --> 01:04:33,519
address that is is is to find some way

1471
01:04:31,559 --> 01:04:35,599
to decompact and it could be through

1472
01:04:33,519 --> 01:04:37,278
biod drilling it could also be simply

1473
01:04:35,599 --> 01:04:40,599
through you know some limited and

1474
01:04:37,278 --> 01:04:43,119
targeted uh tillage and then uh to try

1475
01:04:40,599 --> 01:04:44,960
to prevent that from happening uh

1476
01:04:43,119 --> 01:04:46,960
through you know soil Health management

1477
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:49,199
practices and organic matter additions

1478
01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:51,720
and and all that you the soil becomes

1479
01:04:49,199 --> 01:04:54,199
more resilient to to compaction and more

1480
01:04:51,719 --> 01:04:56,679
resistant if you have you know better

1481
01:04:54,199 --> 01:04:59,519
aggregation and better exchange and all

1482
01:04:56,679 --> 01:05:02,358
those kind of things yeah so those are

1483
01:04:59,519 --> 01:05:04,159
uh some of the areas you know we uh

1484
01:05:02,358 --> 01:05:07,278
we've talked in the past about you know

1485
01:05:04,159 --> 01:05:09,038
using Frost uh tillet as well that you

1486
01:05:07,278 --> 01:05:11,440
know wouldn't be that appropriate for

1487
01:05:09,039 --> 01:05:13,319
Berry production but it's um you know

1488
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:16,440
you basically till the soil when it when

1489
01:05:13,318 --> 01:05:19,400
it has a a very shallow Frozen uh

1490
01:05:16,440 --> 01:05:20,838
surface and uh that can be a you know if

1491
01:05:19,400 --> 01:05:23,079
there's been a lot of compaction that

1492
01:05:20,838 --> 01:05:25,278
occurred in the fall that can be a way

1493
01:05:23,079 --> 01:05:27,440
to alleviate the compaction that way you

1494
01:05:25,278 --> 01:05:30,519
do that uh at you know particular time

1495
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:32,880
Windows uh during the

1496
01:05:30,519 --> 01:05:35,038
winter okay and then Kathy has two

1497
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:36,960
related questions she's wondering if

1498
01:05:35,039 --> 01:05:40,079
there is then a short-term and or

1499
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:42,639
long-term residual effect on nitrogen

1500
01:05:40,079 --> 01:05:44,160
availability after the Heavy Rain event

1501
01:05:42,639 --> 01:05:47,239
she's going back to that question

1502
01:05:44,159 --> 01:05:49,480
initially that she asked and then if

1503
01:05:47,239 --> 01:05:52,358
nitrogen is applied after the Heavy Rain

1504
01:05:49,480 --> 01:05:56,199
event is it more susceptible to loss if

1505
01:05:52,358 --> 01:05:59,199
another event follows

1506
01:05:56,199 --> 01:06:01,679
um there's not necessarily a residual

1507
01:05:59,199 --> 01:06:03,960
effect that that that I'm aware of and

1508
01:06:01,679 --> 01:06:06,798
so if you have such a heavy rainfall

1509
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:09,400
event you you lose a certain amount of

1510
01:06:06,798 --> 01:06:11,038
of the nitrogen um you know so if if

1511
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:13,240
most of the nitrogen that's in the soil

1512
01:06:11,039 --> 01:06:16,440
is in a nitrate form so the most

1513
01:06:13,239 --> 01:06:18,399
reactive form uh then you will lose a

1514
01:06:16,440 --> 01:06:20,400
significant amount of that uh with a

1515
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:22,798
with a big rainfall event either through

1516
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:24,880
leeching or through

1517
01:06:22,798 --> 01:06:28,038
denitrification uh and then it's gone

1518
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:30,599
and you won't get it back basically um

1519
01:06:28,039 --> 01:06:33,359
then there's no necessarily not a

1520
01:06:30,599 --> 01:06:35,400
residual uh effect per se other than

1521
01:06:33,358 --> 01:06:38,519
that the soil is at that point in time

1522
01:06:35,400 --> 01:06:41,079
quite wet so if you get another rainfall

1523
01:06:38,519 --> 01:06:43,318
event you know say 4 days later and the

1524
01:06:41,079 --> 01:06:45,318
soil is already wet then of course you

1525
01:06:43,318 --> 01:06:48,679
can go into another leeching or

1526
01:06:45,318 --> 01:06:51,159
denitrification event but if you apply

1527
01:06:48,679 --> 01:06:53,919
the nitrogen you know subsequent to

1528
01:06:51,159 --> 01:06:55,679
these events and not immediately but say

1529
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:58,200
you know a week later or something like

1530
01:06:55,679 --> 01:07:00,399
that then in principle that's not being

1531
01:06:58,199 --> 01:07:02,519
impacted by what happened to the to the

1532
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:06,559
to the previous nitrogen and that is a

1533
01:07:02,519 --> 01:07:10,239
way to make up for some of these

1534
01:07:06,559 --> 01:07:14,160
losses all right I think does anyone

1535
01:07:10,239 --> 01:07:14,159
else have any questions for Dr

1536
01:07:15,159 --> 01:07:22,679
vaness all right they're pretty quiet um

1537
01:07:18,599 --> 01:07:25,079
I'll just move into the exit uh screen I

1538
01:07:22,679 --> 01:07:28,159
want to thank um Dr Harold vaness for

1539
01:07:25,079 --> 01:07:31,039
being with with us today um and I want

1540
01:07:28,159 --> 01:07:33,239
to remind the the group that remains

1541
01:07:31,039 --> 01:07:36,400
that the speaker for the next webinar is

1542
01:07:33,239 --> 01:07:38,959
Dr balinsky Santos who is the assistant

1543
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:41,000
professor of horiculture um at the

1544
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:43,400
University of Florida and the topic will

1545
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:45,278
be fertigation and hydroponics of

1546
01:07:43,400 --> 01:07:47,760
strawberries he'll talk about new

1547
01:07:45,278 --> 01:07:51,000
diagnostic tools and Precision Precision

1548
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:53,000
agriculture for Berry crops um again if

1549
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:55,119
you have not completed the demographics

1550
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:58,358
questionnaire or the pretest please take

1551
01:07:55,119 --> 01:08:00,760
an opportunity to do that right now and

1552
01:07:58,358 --> 01:08:03,719
um I want to thank all of you for

1553
01:08:00,760 --> 01:08:06,000
joining us and we will see you the next

1554
01:08:03,719 --> 01:08:09,278
webinar is March 2nd so we have a couple

1555
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:11,880
of weeks break and then we'll be back on

1556
01:08:09,278 --> 01:08:17,118
March 2nd and March 9th finishing again

1557
01:08:11,880 --> 01:08:17,118
