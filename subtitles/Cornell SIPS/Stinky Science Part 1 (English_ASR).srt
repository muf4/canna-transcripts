1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:05,520
this is a production of cornell

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:05,519
university

3
00:00:11,919 --> 00:00:14,960
the the nation these plants are very

4
00:00:13,919 --> 00:00:18,079
rhythmic

5
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:19,199
okay so think of skunk cabbage of jack

6
00:00:18,079 --> 00:00:20,959
in the pulpit

7
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:22,400
your experience with much smaller

8
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,760
versions of this this is you know if

9
00:00:22,399 --> 00:00:25,118
georgia o'keeffe could have done this

10
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,840
she would have

11
00:00:25,118 --> 00:00:29,198
but this plant wasn't as popular at that

12
00:00:27,839 --> 00:00:30,800
during her heyday than

13
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:32,160
as it is now now it's as we were

14
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,439
discussing before it's a little bit of a

15
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:35,439
growth industry and

16
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:36,960
greenhouses and botanical gardens around

17
00:00:35,439 --> 00:00:39,280
the world um

18
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,160
one of the things i've been telling my

19
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,039
colleagues

20
00:00:40,159 --> 00:00:44,078
in my own field is that the the draw of

21
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:46,558
this plant is not

22
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:48,558
that other flowers do this the draw of

23
00:00:46,558 --> 00:00:51,439
this plant is that it has a hold

24
00:00:48,558 --> 00:00:53,198
on the human imagination okay it has

25
00:00:51,439 --> 00:00:55,359
charisma it fills rooms we're going to

26
00:00:53,198 --> 00:00:58,238
have thousands of people come see this

27
00:00:55,359 --> 00:01:00,079
so the outreach opportunity is not that

28
00:00:58,238 --> 00:01:02,640
crop plants do this

29
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:03,920
and honey bees like this the outreach

30
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,320
opportunity is that this

31
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,040
is a bigger than life example of what it

32
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:09,839
takes

33
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:11,280
for plants to reproduce okay huge i mean

34
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,079
paul can show you the quorum

35
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,960
this is a like literal investment in in

36
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:17,599
mass

37
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:18,319
of stored sun power you know in as

38
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:21,039
starch

39
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:22,719
and what it takes to marshal all that

40
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,680
into this unbelievable effort of

41
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:25,599
flowering

42
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,880
and the fact that it's gone after three

43
00:01:25,599 --> 00:01:30,719
days is

44
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:33,359
is is is you know almost mythological

45
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:35,599
to me so what we're really interested in

46
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:37,840
and i try to talk to students about

47
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:40,319
is that the plant is almost behaving

48
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,359
okay most plant biology happens so

49
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:43,839
slowly

50
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:45,519
uh and and so under our noses that we

51
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,680
don't we think of them as passive

52
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:48,640
right but what this plant is doing is

53
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:51,200
very active

54
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,759
it's growing fast enough for you to see

55
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,118
it

56
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:54,879
okay you come back every day and you see

57
00:01:53,118 --> 00:01:56,799
oh okay it's three inches taller

58
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:58,239
it's wider it's heavier it's marshaling

59
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:00,240
all this energy

60
00:01:58,239 --> 00:02:02,078
when it blooms this has been called on

61
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:04,239
the literature d-day

62
00:02:02,078 --> 00:02:05,118
you know because of the incredible

63
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:08,639
explosion

64
00:02:05,118 --> 00:02:10,878
of heat and stink and and in the visual

65
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:14,000
display this this skirt the spathe

66
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:17,280
becomes a beautiful purple funnel

67
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,400
um william barthevolt in in in germany

68
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,080
has actually

69
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,000
modeled with engineers the idea that it

70
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,480
might actually be a convection

71
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,598
chimney okay since since this whole

72
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:27,919
plant is

73
00:02:25,598 --> 00:02:29,679
strongly thermogenic it's it's heating

74
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:32,878
up to eight to ten degrees

75
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:35,120
centigrade above ambient why on earth is

76
00:02:32,878 --> 00:02:37,840
it doing that why is it doing it from

77
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:39,439
sunset on d-day to midnight which is

78
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,439
when it happens and we have thermal

79
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:43,759
images from two years ago showing

80
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:45,919
beautifully in color coding how this

81
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:48,639
thing gets really hot

82
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:49,359
but if you look at the the spade around

83
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:52,479
it

84
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:53,200
and realize that that the active part of

85
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:55,039
the flower

86
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:57,679
biology is down here in this little

87
00:02:55,039 --> 00:03:00,400
chamber of these tiny little florets

88
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,920
what it's doing is it's heating as it's

89
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,599
emitting scent

90
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:05,359
and the convection currents that would

91
00:03:03,598 --> 00:03:06,399
be produced by that would actually carry

92
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,720
that scent

93
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,760
up into the forest canopy and away from

94
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:12,959
the forest floor

95
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:14,799
in a rain forest okay it's very stable

96
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:16,000
place rainforest understories don't have

97
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,480
a lot of wind

98
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,439
all right so a rafflesia flower in the

99
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:22,719
same

100
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:26,318
habitat you know in tropical asia

101
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:28,719
very large very stinky not as strongly

102
00:03:26,318 --> 00:03:30,958
heated or thermogenic the odor there

103
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:33,759
would bleb off in the boundary layer

104
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:34,719
and diffuse along the forest floor where

105
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:37,359
beetles and

106
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:39,519
and flies that come to dead animals

107
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,879
would perceive it and fly to the flower

108
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:43,039
and there's lots of nice david

109
00:03:40,878 --> 00:03:45,280
attenborough footage of what happens to

110
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:47,039
rafflesia flowers and borneo and sumatra

111
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,919
etc

112
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:51,439
what the the german study was so why

113
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:52,399
that was so interesting to us was the

114
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:54,239
idea that

115
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,840
this plant may have a different niche

116
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:57,438
growing in the same forest it might be

117
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:00,479
advertising to

118
00:03:57,438 --> 00:04:02,479
carry on insects up at the canopy

119
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:04,000
rather than down on the forest floor

120
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:06,639
using physics

121
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,759
basically creating a chimney and so one

122
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:10,399
of these we've been interested in

123
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:11,120
is what's the schedule why are they

124
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,319
producing

125
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:16,478
their blast of heat and scent at dusk

126
00:04:14,318 --> 00:04:18,879
on d-day why does that persist until

127
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:18,879
midnight

128
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:25,199
this has been a production of cornell
