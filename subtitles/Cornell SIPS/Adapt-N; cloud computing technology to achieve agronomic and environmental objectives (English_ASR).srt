1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:05,120
this is a production of cornell

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:05,120
university

3
00:00:07,278 --> 00:00:13,280
so this is a story about

4
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:14,400
nitrogen management on maize corn

5
00:00:13,279 --> 00:00:17,198
and

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,880
basically research development of a tool

7
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:20,480
extension of that tool

8
00:00:18,879 --> 00:00:22,480
and then recently the commercialization

9
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,760
of that tool

10
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:27,199
so a little bit of background about

11
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,560
nitrogen especially on corn

12
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:30,400
and there's kind of two components of it

13
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:32,479
of course the production the agronomic

14
00:00:30,399 --> 00:00:34,558
aspect and then the environmental

15
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:36,879
component so farmers spend a lot of

16
00:00:34,558 --> 00:00:40,799
money on nitration sometimes they spend

17
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,800
more nitrogen than they do on seed

18
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:45,280
end use efficiency

19
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,760
remains quite low a lot of that nitrogen

20
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:49,520
gets lost doesn't end up in the plant

21
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:51,119
there's a lot of uncertainty associated

22
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:53,600
with nitrogen management especially with

23
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:55,038
increasing weather variability

24
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:57,039
and then we have all these what we call

25
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:58,960
negative externalities

26
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:00,879
so high energy

27
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:03,198
input because of the hebrew boss process

28
00:01:00,878 --> 00:01:05,518
to manufacture synthetic nitrogen

29
00:01:03,198 --> 00:01:07,280
the greenhouse gas emissions very

30
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,000
considerable i'll show you some data on

31
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,519
that

32
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,200
and then persistent water quality

33
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:12,719
problems basically and we've been

34
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,920
throwing a lot of money at that for

35
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:17,438
years without really any any progress so

36
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,920
a little bit about you know the hypoxia

37
00:01:17,438 --> 00:01:21,839
problem i'm sure you're familiar with it

38
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,519
so we have this dead zone basically in

39
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,600
the gulf of mexico that develops in the

40
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:26,798
late summer every year

41
00:01:25,599 --> 00:01:29,039
and

42
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:32,880
the epa has some goals to get that down

43
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:35,759
to about 2 000 square meter miles

44
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:38,158
but we're persistently averaging about 5

45
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:40,799
000 even this year

46
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:42,079
so we're not really making any progress

47
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:43,920
uh this is

48
00:01:42,078 --> 00:01:45,279
where most of it comes from you know

49
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,200
obviously

50
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49,040
corn production areas especially on

51
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,118
poorly drained soils that have tile

52
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,799
drainage that causes a hydrologic

53
00:01:51,118 --> 00:01:55,280
shortcut

54
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:57,439
and so the epa has uh through the gulf

55
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:00,399
hypoxia action planning goal to reduce

56
00:01:57,438 --> 00:02:02,000
those losses by 45 percent

57
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:03,280
even if you get a hundred percent of the

58
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,078
farmers

59
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,359
to

60
00:02:04,078 --> 00:02:07,279
really manage the nitrogen very

61
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:09,118
carefully it will be very difficult to

62
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,878
reach 45 percent you're never going to

63
00:02:09,118 --> 00:02:13,598
be able to get 40 you know 100 of the

64
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:15,919
farmers so it's it's challenging uh the

65
00:02:13,598 --> 00:02:18,159
epa is pushing it onto the states

66
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:19,439
and they each have their own goals and i

67
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:22,400
should mention of course that the

68
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:24,719
chesapeake bay very similar problem and

69
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,000
uh so this is not an easy problem to

70
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:27,520
address

71
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,120
in addition we have the greenhouse gas

72
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,239
emissions so nitrous oxide is the

73
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,640
largest

74
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:35,360
contribution from agriculture in terms

75
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:38,479
of global warming

76
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:39,599
44 methane is second carbon dioxide

77
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:41,919
third methane is probably a little

78
00:02:39,598 --> 00:02:44,719
higher now that they increase the uh

79
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:46,559
ghd component uh here's a little

80
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:48,959
interesting factoid basically nitrogen

81
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:51,360
application on agricultural land has as

82
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:53,519
much of a greenhouse gas impact as the

83
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,360
u.s aviation industry so all the planes

84
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:57,759
that are flying around

85
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,840
you know have have a similar impact so

86
00:02:57,759 --> 00:03:02,719
it's it's a considerable problem and

87
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:05,360
we're managing it very inefficiently

88
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:09,199
so the idea is really if we can really

89
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:11,040
match the nitrogen that the plant needs

90
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:12,958
um exactly

91
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:14,479
so we don't over fertilize and we just

92
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:16,158
provide exactly the amount that the

93
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:17,679
plant needs because it's a critical

94
00:03:16,158 --> 00:03:18,799
plant nutrient and it's important for

95
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,800
yield

96
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:23,040
so what is the optimum nitrogen rate

97
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:25,200
well this is some data from iowa corn

98
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:27,439
after corn corn after soybean so your

99
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:31,598
optimum end rate may range from

100
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:34,158
100 to 250 actually probably 300.

101
00:03:31,598 --> 00:03:36,399
okay and you can say well you know most

102
00:03:34,158 --> 00:03:38,560
likely you're going to be needing this

103
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,959
or this amount

104
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:42,400
but you have this huge range now this is

105
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:44,400
not random

106
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:47,360
there are underlying factors of this

107
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:49,840
variability soil types especially

108
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,799
weather rotations especially you know et

109
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,920
cetera

110
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:55,599
so what adopt 10 does it aims to manage

111
00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:57,679
this variability

112
00:03:55,598 --> 00:04:00,079
right so that we can tell you in this

113
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,840
year on this field you maybe need only

114
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:04,000
about this much but in another year you

115
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,039
maybe need about that much so just

116
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,039
improved

117
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:08,318
dynamic recommendations

118
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:09,919
it's a little bit about the history so

119
00:04:08,318 --> 00:04:11,518
this really goes back

120
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:13,438
into the 80s it's

121
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:15,039
a lot of people collaborated on this

122
00:04:13,438 --> 00:04:16,399
even people like jeff wagonette and john

123
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:18,719
hudson for those of you have been around

124
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:20,159
for a long time so we we've been able to

125
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,440
take advantage of a lot of that

126
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,639
investment

127
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:27,279
1998 was really the idea that we

128
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:29,519
analyzed a lot of field trials

129
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:30,559
and used our model

130
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:32,079
to

131
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,399
to basically replicate the results of

132
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:35,839
the field trial and we did quite well so

133
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:38,159
we were able to then say well we can

134
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:40,159
turn that around we can use the model to

135
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,880
make better predictions

136
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:44,880
of the seasonal nitrogen needs and since

137
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:47,839
most of that variability is the result

138
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:49,759
of early season weather patterns when

139
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:50,879
you can still have an opportunity to

140
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:52,400
intervene

141
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:53,519
so maybe when the when the corn is about

142
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:55,679
this high

143
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:56,959
you have an opportunity to much to

144
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,319
really improve the nation

145
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:59,680
recommendations

146
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:00,879
so then we got some funding the

147
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,240
computational

148
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:03,199
initiative

149
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,680
then

150
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:08,000
about 10 years we started to

151
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:11,439
send out email recommendations through

152
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,439
the extension system then in 2008 we

153
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:15,038
developed what's then called the adapt

154
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:17,839
end tool and was more or less a

155
00:05:15,038 --> 00:05:17,839
cloud-based tool

156
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:22,840
in 2011 we started to do extensive field

157
00:05:20,478 --> 00:05:25,519
trials basically in many places many

158
00:05:22,839 --> 00:05:27,679
states especially new york and iowa and

159
00:05:25,519 --> 00:05:29,758
then this past year we licensed the

160
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,759
product and it's now been commercialized

161
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:33,520
for a startup company that company by

162
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:36,400
the end of the year will have

163
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:38,799
nine employees

164
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:40,719
so unless you've been living in a cave

165
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,800
for the past few years you know that

166
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,560
cloud computing is changing the way we

167
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:47,439
live the way we shop the way we

168
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,160
communicate the way we bank everything

169
00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:49,038
so

170
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,639
our

171
00:05:49,038 --> 00:05:52,399
clientele

172
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:54,560
farmers consultants

173
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:56,319
people like that are very mobile people

174
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,800
they don't sit in an office very much so

175
00:05:56,319 --> 00:06:01,680
they are uh very much going to be

176
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:04,240
benefiting from cloud-based mobile

177
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:06,240
technology and that's what we're trying

178
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:08,960
to address you know and then if you

179
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:11,519
bring in the opportunity to do adaptive

180
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:13,918
real-time localized services

181
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:14,639
that we all in a way use when we use all

182
00:06:13,918 --> 00:06:16,318
these

183
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:19,680
these great apps and all that then we

184
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:22,080
can really hopefully make some progress

185
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:25,439
so now we have adaptn.com it used to be

186
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:27,680
adopt n.cals.cornell.edu

187
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:30,478
thank god now we have adaptdn.com it's a

188
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:32,560
commercial company you now have to pay

189
00:06:30,478 --> 00:06:35,199
to get an account

190
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:36,959
and but it also has allowed us to really

191
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:39,120
bring this up to a much higher level in

192
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:40,879
terms of the sophistication and it's

193
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,879
growing and growing

194
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:45,680
so one of the great things about cornell

195
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:47,759
and if you get involved with licensing

196
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:49,360
and you have some equity in the company

197
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:50,879
and they fund some of your research you

198
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,479
have to put up a slide like that you

199
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:53,519
have to disclose

200
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:55,038
that you

201
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:57,198
have some kind of a relationship with

202
00:06:55,038 --> 00:06:58,959
that company so that's what i'm doing to

203
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:01,199
you right now

204
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:02,638
just in case somebody from the the

205
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:05,120
committee on

206
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:08,079
conflict of interest is in the room

207
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:09,598
um so what does adapt end up do and i'm

208
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:11,359
not going to go

209
00:07:09,598 --> 00:07:14,719
into any of the details it basically

210
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:17,439
takes information on whether soil crop

211
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:19,360
and some economic factors to generate a

212
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:21,680
nitrogen rate recommendation for a

213
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,759
particular field at a particular time

214
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:26,000
that's basically the idea and you can

215
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:29,038
see here what all those factors are

216
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:31,598
and i'll show you some screenshots

217
00:07:29,038 --> 00:07:34,000
one key component is is weather

218
00:07:31,598 --> 00:07:35,918
and uh so we're using the high

219
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,759
resolution weather information that's

220
00:07:35,918 --> 00:07:40,000
generated at the northeast climate

221
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:41,919
center on the 11th floor of broadfield

222
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,519
hall they've been a very critical

223
00:07:41,918 --> 00:07:44,560
partner in all this

224
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:46,560
and

225
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:48,959
the high resolution part of it is very

226
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,478
critical because you can see this is a

227
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:53,198
a one-day

228
00:07:50,478 --> 00:07:54,800
precipitation graph

229
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:56,840
and you can see for example that this

230
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:59,038
part southeastern iowa

231
00:07:56,839 --> 00:08:01,519
received uh six to eight inches of

232
00:07:59,038 --> 00:08:05,120
precipitation but then you go only maybe

233
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:07,598
about 10 15 kilometers to the north or

234
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:10,000
or the east and they only got maybe like

235
00:08:07,598 --> 00:08:12,560
one or two inches okay so it's highly

236
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,399
variable if you don't have good high

237
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,759
resolution weather information you're

238
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:17,279
not going to be able to make a good

239
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:18,479
recommendation

240
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:20,000
in addition

241
00:08:18,478 --> 00:08:21,918
we've seen that these very heavy

242
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,639
precipitation events defined as greater

243
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:27,839
than two inches

244
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:29,918
have increased over the past 50 years in

245
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:32,158
general we're seeing more of these heavy

246
00:08:29,918 --> 00:08:33,598
precipitation events

247
00:08:32,158 --> 00:08:35,519
especially in the northeast and

248
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:39,759
certainly also in the corn belt by the

249
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:42,959
way this is 1958 is the year of my birth

250
00:08:39,759 --> 00:08:44,158
correlation does not equate causation

251
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:46,559
remember

252
00:08:44,158 --> 00:08:49,519
so i didn't do this although i probably

253
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:50,879
did contribute to it like all of you did

254
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:52,320
okay just you know a couple of

255
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:54,399
screenshots just to give you a little

256
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,920
bit of a sense of the tool

257
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:58,240
you can you know

258
00:08:55,919 --> 00:09:00,000
find your field on a map or you can drop

259
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:02,560
a shape file if that means anything to

260
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,240
you it's a gis based

261
00:09:02,559 --> 00:09:06,559
file system

262
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,759
here's another one you can see the field

263
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:09,599
identified

264
00:09:07,759 --> 00:09:11,278
and then you

265
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,440
basically populate that with some

266
00:09:11,278 --> 00:09:14,879
information about the soil and the

267
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:17,680
management

268
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:19,838
i'll show you that for example here's uh

269
00:09:17,679 --> 00:09:22,159
you indicate what soil type it is it can

270
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:24,480
by name like a honey or silt loam or it

271
00:09:22,159 --> 00:09:26,879
can just be by the textural class like a

272
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,800
silty clay lump or something like that

273
00:09:26,879 --> 00:09:31,360
and then that links it to very extensive

274
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:32,799
soil databases that we have as part of

275
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,560
the tool

276
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:37,120
you indicate when it's artificially

277
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:39,199
drained and things like that

278
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:40,639
you provide information on the tillage

279
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:43,120
methodology

280
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:44,799
how much residue is on the surface

281
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,240
how much organic matter is in the soil

282
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:48,159
because that's actually a very important

283
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:51,278
factor

284
00:09:48,159 --> 00:09:54,559
crop information the the the

285
00:09:51,278 --> 00:09:56,480
well it's sweet or grain or silage corn

286
00:09:54,559 --> 00:09:57,838
or the maturity class is what the date

287
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,039
of planting

288
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:00,640
um

289
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:01,360
the population

290
00:10:00,639 --> 00:10:03,039
the

291
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:05,839
rotational effects so what's the

292
00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:07,679
previous crop is it sod is it soybean is

293
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:09,839
it weak or things like that and then

294
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:11,599
some other information

295
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:13,839
percent legume and all that if that's

296
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:16,480
appropriate notice also the pain here

297
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:18,959
that's you know a nice feature so if you

298
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:21,759
say manage multiple zones or multiple

299
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:23,679
fields the same way you can just click

300
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:26,159
on this and then so the same information

301
00:10:23,679 --> 00:10:27,679
applies to multiple fields those kind of

302
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:29,759
things are really very important to the

303
00:10:27,679 --> 00:10:31,759
user you know as researchers were like

304
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:33,679
ah whatever but it's very important to

305
00:10:31,759 --> 00:10:34,879
the users so then of course how much

306
00:10:33,679 --> 00:10:36,958
nitration

307
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:38,639
you have already applied so maybe a

308
00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:40,879
pre-planned application or a starter

309
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:42,480
application in the midwest maybe even a

310
00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:45,120
fall application

311
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:46,959
and then how much when

312
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:49,278
what's the formulation is anhydrous

313
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:52,239
ammonia is it urea

314
00:10:49,278 --> 00:10:54,159
is it uan whatever

315
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,440
uh how much manure has been applied and

316
00:10:54,159 --> 00:10:58,000
what uh

317
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:59,920
the content of nitrogen and all that in

318
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,240
the manures of course is we're a dairy

319
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:03,759
state very important feature of this

320
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:06,320
particular tool

321
00:11:03,759 --> 00:11:08,399
and irrigation as well all right so just

322
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:09,920
to give you a little bit of of a sense a

323
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:12,320
little bit of flavor

324
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:15,120
so then you would run the model uh

325
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:17,200
currently it's all on at a large data

326
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,879
center actually one in virginia and one

327
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,800
in idaho i believe

328
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:22,480
uh this is you know these famous kind of

329
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:24,559
big data centers that's what you use

330
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:26,480
very inexpensive by the way

331
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:28,559
um so then you get a recommendation for

332
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:31,200
this particular field is 140 pounds per

333
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:33,119
acre gives you a level of confidence you

334
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:35,120
might say and it gives you a whole bunch

335
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:36,720
of background information on how much

336
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:39,600
nitrogen is currently in the soil how

337
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:42,240
much is still needed

338
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:44,720
how much has been lost so far through

339
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:46,240
rainfall especially or maybe ammonia

340
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:48,480
volatilization

341
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:50,159
how much water is is currently in the

342
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:54,079
soil how much precipitation have we

343
00:11:50,159 --> 00:11:54,078
received there's even an irrigation

344
00:11:54,559 --> 00:11:57,599
advisory that will be part of that next

345
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,519
year

346
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:04,079
and then you can enter different dates

347
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:05,919
so today's uh october what 16th

348
00:12:04,078 --> 00:12:08,879
you're not going to be applying nitrogen

349
00:12:05,919 --> 00:12:11,919
on corn today but you would be maybe on

350
00:12:08,879 --> 00:12:14,078
june 16th and so you can enter june 16th

351
00:12:11,919 --> 00:12:15,519
or any other date and you can then

352
00:12:14,078 --> 00:12:17,599
generate a recommendation for that

353
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:18,399
particular date so you can go back

354
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,000
and

355
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:21,919
at the end of the season do what if

356
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,519
scenarios etc

357
00:12:21,919 --> 00:12:26,000
we have some functionality that makes it

358
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:27,679
attractive to a farmer for example you

359
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,200
know it rolls up the

360
00:12:27,679 --> 00:12:30,799
the the the

361
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:33,680
nitrogen recommendations for each field

362
00:12:30,799 --> 00:12:36,159
so this farmer would have to purchase

363
00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:37,838
this much night age in total so you know

364
00:12:36,159 --> 00:12:40,078
some of the functionality that helps

365
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:42,959
them manage their their fields

366
00:12:40,078 --> 00:12:44,958
um gives the max in the min and then it

367
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:46,799
basically allows you to look at each

368
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:49,278
field individually you can just click on

369
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:50,399
this then the whole the individual field

370
00:12:49,278 --> 00:12:52,480
comes up

371
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:54,159
just nice functionalities then you may

372
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,480
be an agronomist or a crop consultant

373
00:12:54,159 --> 00:12:58,799
who is working with multiple farmers so

374
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:01,519
they have their summaries you know so

375
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:03,519
these are multiple for for a typical

376
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:06,720
consultant is actually this may be a

377
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:08,799
hundred or so or even 500 fields

378
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:10,639
okay so try to make it attractive for

379
00:13:08,799 --> 00:13:12,879
them to use

380
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:15,759
so we have the daily alerts so

381
00:13:12,879 --> 00:13:17,360
instead of you doing the simulation

382
00:13:15,759 --> 00:13:19,278
we do it

383
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:20,720
daily so when the new weather

384
00:13:19,278 --> 00:13:23,600
information comes in

385
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:25,680
it gets run and then you get an email or

386
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:27,680
text message so you basically get a

387
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:29,679
daily update on the nitrogen status of

388
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:30,719
your field and how much nitrogen might

389
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:32,399
be needed

390
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:34,079
and you can see i mean this is when you

391
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:36,720
bring in the professional programmers it

392
00:13:34,078 --> 00:13:38,399
really really looks nice

393
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,600
we also give a lot of

394
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:41,519
insights

395
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,440
try to be very transparent about what

396
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:45,360
the recommendation is based on

397
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:47,440
so for example some of these graphical

398
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:49,440
outputs and i'll show you just a couple

399
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:51,279
this is precipitation and nitrogen loss

400
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,560
so here's the precip and here's the

401
00:13:51,278 --> 00:13:55,360
nitrogen loss

402
00:13:52,559 --> 00:13:58,479
okay so this was quite wet so

403
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:59,919
this for this field lost about 80 pounds

404
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,159
of nitrogen because they had applied a

405
00:13:59,919 --> 00:14:04,240
lot of pre-plant nitrogen

406
00:14:02,159 --> 00:14:06,480
cumulative precipitation bleaching and

407
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:08,399
gases and losses

408
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:11,440
probably by next month we'll have the

409
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:13,198
n2o losses associated with that

410
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:14,800
and mineralized nitrogen and temperature

411
00:14:13,198 --> 00:14:17,039
of course they're highly correlated as

412
00:14:14,799 --> 00:14:18,479
well just there's more graphs i just

413
00:14:17,039 --> 00:14:20,319
want to give you

414
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,440
a sense

415
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:23,199
so

416
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,800
now there's kind of this broader picture

417
00:14:23,198 --> 00:14:27,919
and one i wanted to highlight and that's

418
00:14:24,799 --> 00:14:30,159
walmart so walmart has

419
00:14:27,919 --> 00:14:33,198
a goal to reduce their carbon footprint

420
00:14:30,159 --> 00:14:35,919
by i think it's 20 million tons per year

421
00:14:33,198 --> 00:14:38,240
which is really quite ambitious

422
00:14:35,919 --> 00:14:40,319
walmart did an analysis of their top 10

423
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:42,399
products now keep in mind that also the

424
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:44,079
nation's largest grocer

425
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:46,240
right they're they're selling a lot of

426
00:14:44,078 --> 00:14:48,319
groceries and not only the us they're a

427
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:50,000
global company as you know

428
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:52,320
revenue is equivalent to the gdp of

429
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,240
belgium i mean this is a big player

430
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:56,560
largest employer in the world

431
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:58,799
so when walmart says we want to reduce

432
00:14:56,559 --> 00:15:01,439
our carbon footprint people start to pay

433
00:14:58,799 --> 00:15:03,759
attention walmart looked at the top 10

434
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:06,399
products and found that about 45 percent

435
00:15:03,759 --> 00:15:08,799
of their carbon footprint is associated

436
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:10,958
with nitrogen fertilizer for the top 10

437
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:13,198
top 100 products

438
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:14,559
which is really quite remarkable okay so

439
00:15:13,198 --> 00:15:16,958
they want to

440
00:15:14,559 --> 00:15:18,799
reduce that impact

441
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:19,919
so they're looking at tools like adapt

442
00:15:18,799 --> 00:15:22,078
then

443
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:24,078
to be able to achieve that which we're

444
00:15:22,078 --> 00:15:26,638
very happy about i was at an event last

445
00:15:24,078 --> 00:15:28,399
week in bentonville and they featured

446
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:30,480
this farmer tim richter he's an iowa

447
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:32,399
farmer who's used adopt n

448
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:34,240
and he talked about his experience with

449
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:35,278
with the tool which was fortunately very

450
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,399
positive

451
00:15:35,278 --> 00:15:37,600
for us

452
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:40,639
and there's

453
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:42,480
organizations like edf and tnc who are

454
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:44,240
really trying to promote this so what

455
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:46,720
adapt then now is doing is it's pushing

456
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:48,720
this up the supply chain so it has

457
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:50,959
agreements from kellogg's and general

458
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:52,639
mills and pepsico and coca-cola and

459
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:54,879
campbell soup

460
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:56,000
smithfield murphy brown or large pork

461
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:57,198
producer

462
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,278
for them

463
00:15:57,198 --> 00:16:01,198
to start using these kind of tools which

464
00:15:59,278 --> 00:16:04,078
is very exciting we're not quite there

465
00:16:01,198 --> 00:16:05,679
yet but we're getting close

466
00:16:04,078 --> 00:16:07,198
another interesting development was in

467
00:16:05,679 --> 00:16:08,719
the past year

468
00:16:07,198 --> 00:16:10,399
so we've had this tool out there for a

469
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,759
while all of a sudden guess what

470
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:13,839
monsanto

471
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:16,000
and dupont pioneer come out with an

472
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:18,160
adapt and type version

473
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,600
and it's like oh okay that's interesting

474
00:16:18,159 --> 00:16:21,919
we weren't too happy we had just

475
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,600
licensed the product to this little

476
00:16:21,919 --> 00:16:25,198
startup company

477
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,639
and um

478
00:16:25,198 --> 00:16:28,399
but you know it's actually been i have

479
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:30,639
to say especially dupont pioneers

480
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:32,480
somewhat unscrupulous about these things

481
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:34,720
they they pretend like they invented

482
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:36,560
this it's like come on you guys you had

483
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:38,480
your agronomist use our tool for two

484
00:16:36,559 --> 00:16:40,319
three years and we talked to your chief

485
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:42,240
agronomist you know you didn't invent it

486
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,839
but at least be honest about that but

487
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:46,320
you know there's actually been a real

488
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:48,399
upside to this because now all of a

489
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:51,199
sudden everybody thinks that this

490
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:53,039
approach has a lot of merit because the

491
00:16:51,198 --> 00:16:55,838
big guys jumped into it

492
00:16:53,039 --> 00:16:58,399
and so it's actually really benefited us

493
00:16:55,839 --> 00:17:00,800
to to see these big companies getting

494
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:02,720
into this technology because it gave a

495
00:17:00,799 --> 00:17:04,798
lot of credibility to what we were doing

496
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:06,720
so it's been been good

497
00:17:04,798 --> 00:17:08,879
so this is currently where adopt n is

498
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:10,959
being used at least in as of july so

499
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:13,120
it's a mixture of individual farms

500
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:15,679
consultants uh we're even working with

501
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:17,279
some larger companies that are

502
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:19,839
interested in starting to use without

503
00:17:17,279 --> 00:17:19,838
then now

504
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:24,400
so i just wanted to give you a little

505
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:25,839
bit of of data so what we've done

506
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,759
especially in new york and iowa we've

507
00:17:25,838 --> 00:17:29,359
worked in other states as well is do

508
00:17:27,759 --> 00:17:31,200
strip trials where

509
00:17:29,359 --> 00:17:33,599
you basically

510
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:35,840
you go into farmer's fields

511
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:38,000
and you compare the adopt end

512
00:17:35,839 --> 00:17:41,119
recommendation with what the grower

513
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,880
normally applies so it's a direct

514
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:44,319
comparison it's good for demonstration

515
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,760
purposes

516
00:17:44,319 --> 00:17:47,439
it gives you some good data and it's

517
00:17:45,759 --> 00:17:50,319
kind of like a boxing match as a winner

518
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:52,000
and a loser and so you can kind of put

519
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:53,759
it in those terms

520
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,640
and so i'll show you some of the results

521
00:17:53,759 --> 00:17:59,679
from new york and iowa and these were

522
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:01,679
all the wonderful collaborators

523
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:03,440
so this is actually this this we kind of

524
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:06,400
summarized the data just recently so

525
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:09,679
it's 104 strip trials

526
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:11,200
um and uh so over those over three year

527
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:14,160
period

528
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:15,519
so here you see the difference in total

529
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:17,279
and applied so remember this is the

530
00:18:15,519 --> 00:18:18,720
adopt end rate versus what the grower

531
00:18:17,279 --> 00:18:20,720
would normally use

532
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:23,519
so in in the vast majority of the cases

533
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:25,279
in 87 out of 104 the adopt-in

534
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:26,960
recommendation was lower

535
00:18:25,279 --> 00:18:28,960
okay so we

536
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:30,798
and so less nitrogen was supplied which

537
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:33,279
is a good thing for the environment in a

538
00:18:30,798 --> 00:18:36,240
few cases we recommended more and that

539
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:38,639
was in mostly in 2003 when we had a very

540
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:40,160
wet growing season and a higher rate was

541
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,280
justified

542
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:43,679
okay

543
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:44,639
so this is the delta yield

544
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:47,519
so

545
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:49,600
in most cases when we said put less

546
00:18:47,519 --> 00:18:51,759
nitrogen on but they were able to on the

547
00:18:49,599 --> 00:18:52,719
average achieve the same yield that's a

548
00:18:51,759 --> 00:18:54,720
good thing

549
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:56,640
the same yield with less nitrogen so

550
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:58,400
less environmental impact

551
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:00,000
and then in a few cases where we said

552
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,759
put more on

553
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,798
that needs to be justified by higher

554
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:04,879
yields

555
00:19:02,798 --> 00:19:05,839
and that was in general the case in most

556
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:07,840
cases

557
00:19:05,839 --> 00:19:09,038
the yields were significantly higher

558
00:19:07,839 --> 00:19:11,599
when we said put a little bit more

559
00:19:09,038 --> 00:19:13,759
nitrogen on so it was justified most of

560
00:19:11,599 --> 00:19:15,759
the nitrogen still ended up in the plant

561
00:19:13,759 --> 00:19:17,919
which is good

562
00:19:15,759 --> 00:19:19,679
and then this is the delta profit

563
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:21,759
and you can see that in the vast

564
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:24,480
majority of cases in about four out of

565
00:19:21,759 --> 00:19:25,679
five cases we were able to show greater

566
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,440
profits

567
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:28,640
so what that means is that's a win-win

568
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:31,600
scenario

569
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:34,000
we can we can say to farmers look we can

570
00:19:31,599 --> 00:19:35,279
we can increase your profits

571
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,519
on the average

572
00:19:35,279 --> 00:19:39,519
and you can decrease the amount of

573
00:19:37,519 --> 00:19:41,679
nation that you apply so limiting the

574
00:19:39,519 --> 00:19:43,679
environmental impact and basically by

575
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:45,038
being more precise

576
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:46,559
so here's some of the summary data i

577
00:19:45,038 --> 00:19:49,119
just wanted to point out so here you can

578
00:19:46,558 --> 00:19:51,119
see the and fertilizer inputs for iowa

579
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:53,199
new york the three years

580
00:19:51,119 --> 00:19:54,719
so we always were able to reduce the

581
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:57,679
inputs except

582
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:59,279
in 2013 in new york when it was wet we

583
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:01,840
said put on the average put a little bit

584
00:19:59,279 --> 00:20:04,000
more on but on the average

585
00:20:01,839 --> 00:20:05,439
we were able to significantly reduce the

586
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,919
amount of nitrogen

587
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:09,440
that goes in into onto the field and

588
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:11,759
into the environment

589
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:13,360
uh the yields were in a way positive

590
00:20:11,759 --> 00:20:14,640
primarily for those

591
00:20:13,359 --> 00:20:17,359
for the cases where we said a little bit

592
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:20,720
more and the profit on the average about

593
00:20:17,359 --> 00:20:22,159
35 dollars per acre increase in profit

594
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,600
so

595
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:26,080
that's positive

596
00:20:23,599 --> 00:20:28,000
i'll skip the wisconsin data

597
00:20:26,079 --> 00:20:30,000
so this is basically the bottom line so

598
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,679
if we can do increased profits reduced

599
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,279
environmental inputs and we did some

600
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:35,600
model simulations to look at the

601
00:20:33,279 --> 00:20:37,038
leaching and nitrous oxide losses that's

602
00:20:35,599 --> 00:20:39,359
a good thing so we feel really good

603
00:20:37,038 --> 00:20:42,079
about that it's not perfect but it's a

604
00:20:39,359 --> 00:20:44,479
lot better than what's out there

605
00:20:42,079 --> 00:20:45,519
and you know we feel that transparency

606
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:47,759
and insights even though it's a

607
00:20:45,519 --> 00:20:49,519
commercial product is really valuable

608
00:20:47,759 --> 00:20:50,640
still you know farmers and consultants

609
00:20:49,519 --> 00:20:52,240
like that

610
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:53,840
and it provides incentives for better

611
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:55,919
management we've seen a lot of farmers

612
00:20:53,839 --> 00:20:59,519
who are looking at the losses that they

613
00:20:55,919 --> 00:21:00,960
had from say an early season application

614
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:02,558
and then they get a lot of rain and they

615
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:04,720
lost like in that in their graph they

616
00:21:02,558 --> 00:21:07,759
lost 80 pounds and so they're doing the

617
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:10,480
math and they say boy i lost about 50 an

618
00:21:07,759 --> 00:21:12,720
acre maybe i should change my strategy

619
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:14,000
so being transparent and informative

620
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:16,720
helps with that

621
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,000
okay this is my last slide i i won't

622
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:20,000
mention each of these people

623
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,519
individually but we've had some great

624
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,480
collaborators it's been a great team

625
00:21:21,519 --> 00:21:23,279
effort

626
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:25,519
and

627
00:21:23,279 --> 00:21:28,399
we're very grateful for the multiple

628
00:21:25,519 --> 00:21:28,400
funding sources

629
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:31,640
thank you

630
00:21:35,119 --> 00:21:39,918
yeah that's a good question the um

631
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:41,679
it's it's actually relatively difficult

632
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:43,038
to work with individual farmers that's

633
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:45,200
one of the things we found out there

634
00:21:43,038 --> 00:21:46,558
there are some very high maintenance to

635
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:48,640
a lot of correspondence so we're trying

636
00:21:46,558 --> 00:21:51,440
to focus a little bit more on the larger

637
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:53,679
companies trying to so for example

638
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:55,919
if you can get say cargill or general

639
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:57,440
mills to support that we're also working

640
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:59,600
with walmart directly we're asking

641
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:02,640
walmart why don't you sponsor

642
00:21:59,599 --> 00:22:04,240
you know uh 50 000 acres of the use of

643
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:06,799
adopt-in

644
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:08,319
so that's the kind of the way we we try

645
00:22:06,798 --> 00:22:10,000
to do this

646
00:22:08,319 --> 00:22:11,279
you know people need to get used to the

647
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,720
idea that they have to pay for these

648
00:22:11,279 --> 00:22:16,879
services if you do a soil nitrate test

649
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:18,400
and you send it to a lab you have to pay

650
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:20,799
for that as well

651
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:23,519
these cloud computational tools it costs

652
00:22:20,798 --> 00:22:24,720
money to develop them and to

653
00:22:23,519 --> 00:22:27,359
maintain them

654
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:29,519
so but the cost is relatively low it's

655
00:22:27,359 --> 00:22:32,798
depending on the size it's you know

656
00:22:29,519 --> 00:22:34,879
generally in sort of the 152 dollars per

657
00:22:32,798 --> 00:22:37,279
acre if it's a little bit larger

658
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:40,799
operation so it's really you know and we

659
00:22:37,279 --> 00:22:42,480
have proved a profit of about 35.

660
00:22:40,798 --> 00:22:44,720
but yeah if we can get more more

661
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:46,159
sponsoring then that would be good and

662
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:48,640
one of the funny things about knights

663
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:51,440
and fertilizations it's it's heavily

664
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:53,600
it's very political and very state-based

665
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:56,000
so if you come up with a tool that kind

666
00:22:53,599 --> 00:22:57,119
of transcends all these individual

667
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,640
because every state has their own

668
00:22:57,119 --> 00:23:00,558
recommendation system it's really kind

669
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:03,120
of bizarre when you think about it's a

670
00:23:00,558 --> 00:23:05,038
leftover from many years ago and when

671
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:06,158
you come in with a tool that says you

672
00:23:05,038 --> 00:23:07,599
know

673
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:09,280
you know state boundaries don't matter

674
00:23:07,599 --> 00:23:11,199
anymore because we account for

675
00:23:09,279 --> 00:23:14,798
variations in soil and climate and all

676
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:16,720
that uh there's uh you

677
00:23:14,798 --> 00:23:18,639
meet some resistance it's very

678
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:20,240
interesting especially in the scientific

679
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,679
community

680
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:23,599
yeah

681
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:25,038
so with that i won't talk more about

682
00:23:23,599 --> 00:23:27,839
that because i can

683
00:23:25,038 --> 00:23:27,839
talk for hours

684
00:23:30,079 --> 00:23:37,720
this has been a production of cornell

685
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:37,720
