1
00:00:01,078 --> 00:00:04,719
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,919
University yeah thanks a lot for the

3
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:14,000
introduction and it's um it's really

4
00:00:10,919 --> 00:00:15,679
great to be here um great to be here giv

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,879
um the seminar and uh so I'm going to

6
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:20,439
focus U mostly on phosphorus I think in

7
00:00:17,879 --> 00:00:21,640
my abstract I had listed nitrogen as

8
00:00:20,439 --> 00:00:23,118
well and I was hoping to bring in some

9
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:26,599
of the work that we're doing on nitrogen

10
00:00:23,118 --> 00:00:29,559
but I just recently gave a a talk uh at

11
00:00:26,599 --> 00:00:31,240
the Symposium on phosphorus that was uh

12
00:00:29,559 --> 00:00:34,119
down in an Apolis just a couple months

13
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:35,640
ago and so I kind of built my talk

14
00:00:34,119 --> 00:00:37,199
around that one and kind of expanded a

15
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:38,439
little bit so I think I'm going to to

16
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,440
spend most of my time talking about

17
00:00:38,439 --> 00:00:42,238
phosphorus and the role of hydrology and

18
00:00:40,439 --> 00:00:44,519
connecting phosphorus sources on the

19
00:00:42,238 --> 00:00:46,519
landscape to receiving Waters um and

20
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:48,160
it's kind of be a tour of the ches be

21
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:50,039
Bay and mostly a lot of the research

22
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:51,959
we're doing and then highlighting you

23
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:54,600
know some research from others uh that

24
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:56,439
kind of helps to tell the story um so

25
00:00:54,600 --> 00:01:00,399
I've kind of I've broken this

26
00:00:56,439 --> 00:01:02,679
presentation out into four parts uh um

27
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:05,159
starting with kind of the sloped Upland

28
00:01:02,679 --> 00:01:06,760
regions of the ches beake bay um

29
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:09,520
focusing on some issues in the coastal

30
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:11,478
plane lowlands um mostly in the Del Mara

31
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:13,478
peninsula where we do a lot of work um

32
00:01:11,478 --> 00:01:14,959
where artificial drainage is a kind of

33
00:01:13,478 --> 00:01:17,840
is a is a primary

34
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:20,118
concern streams and rivers so just the

35
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,880
connectivity that occurs um you know in

36
00:01:20,118 --> 00:01:24,319
streams and rivers moving nutrients uh

37
00:01:21,879 --> 00:01:25,719
moving phosphorus you know to Downstream

38
00:01:24,319 --> 00:01:27,199
receiving it Waters and then emerging

39
00:01:25,719 --> 00:01:28,560
concerns just some things I see as kind

40
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,600
of emerging concerns in nutrient

41
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,280
management you know that we should

42
00:01:29,599 --> 00:01:34,679
probably be paying attention to in the

43
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:36,719
future uh so I'm going to start with an

44
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:38,200
area that I know really well I see Todd

45
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:40,399
Walters here he's probably seen some of

46
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:42,000
these slides before um but we do a lot

47
00:01:40,399 --> 00:01:45,040
of work on variable Source area

48
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,438
hydrology as does uh the many groups as

49
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,719
do many groups here at Cornell um and so

50
00:01:47,438 --> 00:01:50,679
a lot of people have contributed to kind

51
00:01:48,718 --> 00:01:52,039
of the ideas on the role of variable

52
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:54,280
Source are hydrology in connecting

53
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:56,200
nutrient sources with receiving Waters

54
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:59,359
here's Cornell this is where we are now

55
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:01,640
just outside of the ches Peake Bay I do

56
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:04,519
a lot of work at the mahango creek

57
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:09,560
experimental watersheds uh mostly this

58
00:02:04,519 --> 00:02:12,840
little uh 7.3 Square km Watershed known

59
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:14,360
as w38 it's kind of a colloquial name um

60
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:16,280
but we have a grided system that you

61
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:18,720
know names our Watershed so it's kind of

62
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:20,680
an interesting name and there are two

63
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:22,719
subcatchments in w38 where we do quite a

64
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:25,000
bit of experimental work one's f36 which

65
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:27,199
I'll refer to a little bit later and one

66
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
is MN it's 11 hectare experimental

67
00:02:27,199 --> 00:02:30,679
Watershed um where we've done some work

68
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,360
on variable source hydrology and

69
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:36,400
nutrient loss um and so we have uh kind

70
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:38,840
of you know two different kinds of soil

71
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:42,158
conditions in this Watershed we have

72
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:43,598
Upland soils here that lack say some

73
00:02:42,158 --> 00:02:44,840
kind of a discontinu soils that would

74
00:02:43,598 --> 00:02:46,598
perch water so they're well- drained

75
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:47,920
soils that don't have a frag pan and

76
00:02:46,598 --> 00:02:50,119
then you here in these lower landscape

77
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:51,839
positions we have frag pin and they um

78
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:53,680
will basically impede vertical movement

79
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,598
of water and will perch water and

80
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:58,040
will'll create areas of

81
00:02:55,598 --> 00:02:59,280
saturation and just kind of this

82
00:02:58,039 --> 00:03:00,919
highlights you know you can see the

83
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,158
nature of these well drained soils and

84
00:03:00,919 --> 00:03:06,280
compare them you know to the poorly

85
00:03:02,158 --> 00:03:08,359
drained soils that we find here um and

86
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:10,239
we go out we send technicians we've done

87
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:12,239
this quite a bit over the years um kind

88
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:14,360
of a very low Tech technique for looking

89
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:16,519
at areas of saturation and Landscape we

90
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:18,000
call it the wet boot or um you've

91
00:03:16,519 --> 00:03:20,959
probably seen the literature even as the

92
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,479
squishy boot technique um honestly there

93
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:24,200
are papers published with that in the

94
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:25,079
title um out of Europe as especially

95
00:03:24,199 --> 00:03:29,158
they' they've tried to actually

96
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:30,319
quantitate uh this method um but anyway

97
00:03:29,158 --> 00:03:32,318
so you take you know we'll go out

98
00:03:30,318 --> 00:03:34,359
seasonally and just find areas of

99
00:03:32,318 --> 00:03:36,000
saturation and take a GPS unit and

100
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:39,120
essentially map them you know so you can

101
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,639
see here in August of 2003 for example

102
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,759
you know the location of some saturated

103
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:44,798
areas um these are disconnected Satur

104
00:03:42,759 --> 00:03:46,479
saturated areas so U assuming they

105
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:47,760
didn't you know you know change over

106
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:48,878
time with any kind of rainfall event

107
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:50,759
they're unlikely to connect to the

108
00:03:48,878 --> 00:03:52,598
stream but you could compare that to

109
00:03:50,759 --> 00:03:55,158
something later in the fall after we've

110
00:03:52,598 --> 00:03:57,158
had a chance to wet up a bit um you know

111
00:03:55,158 --> 00:03:58,359
these saturated areas expand quite a bit

112
00:03:57,158 --> 00:03:59,959
and now these are connected to this

113
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:02,000
little ephemeral stream here so any

114
00:03:59,959 --> 00:04:05,360
nutrient loss that occurs in these zones

115
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,199
um would be a risk to water quality um

116
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,599
there's two types of runoff gener

117
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:11,199
generation mechanisms that we're

118
00:04:08,598 --> 00:04:13,119
concerned with um largely you know

119
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:14,719
infiltration excess runoff in these

120
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,040
zones where we have well drained soils

121
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:17,279
where you know basically it takes a

122
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:19,560
pretty extreme rainfall like a

123
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:21,078
thunderstorm or high-intensity rain to

124
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:23,600
exceed the infiltration capacity of the

125
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:25,519
soils and and to generate runoff um and

126
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,360
you can contrast that against you know

127
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:29,038
we normally see in these zones which is

128
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,038
kind of a perched saturation excess

129
00:04:29,038 --> 00:04:32,959
runoff phom phenomenon where these soils

130
00:04:31,038 --> 00:04:34,399
are saturated any excess rainfall runs

131
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:36,478
off and they're also close to the stream

132
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:37,679
so there's an increased risk of runoff

133
00:04:36,478 --> 00:04:40,000
connecting to the stream and then

134
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,560
nutrient loss so if we zoom in on this

135
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,720
hill slope

136
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:47,439
here we've done years of you know plot

137
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:49,039
scale runoff monitoring at these slates

138
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:51,759
and so these are just totals for about

139
00:04:49,038 --> 00:04:54,079
three years of monitoring um say 2002 to

140
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:55,240
2004 I think and so you can see most of

141
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:56,599
what we're gener most of the runoff

142
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:58,319
that's being generated in in these well-

143
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:00,320
drained soils here is infiltration

144
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:02,478
excess runoff

145
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:04,800
and largely at the lower landscape

146
00:05:02,478 --> 00:05:06,399
position um it's saturation excess

147
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,960
runoff we're using shallow Wells and

148
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:09,599
looking at the the status of the water

149
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:12,159
table and also soil moisture sensors to

150
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:14,280
infer these runoff generation mechanisms

151
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:16,199
but you know over this time period most

152
00:05:14,279 --> 00:05:17,758
of what we get down here is is you

153
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:19,680
saturation excess runoff these are you

154
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:21,680
know largely saturated areas for you

155
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,720
know large parts of the

156
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,959
year and then the management that's

157
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:28,199
imposed on this landscape um you can see

158
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:30,560
that the the trends in soil phosphorus

159
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:32,160
moving up the slope um here at the lower

160
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,879
landscape position we're just above

161
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:36,120
agronomic Optimum in terms of you know

162
00:05:33,879 --> 00:05:37,478
soil phosphorus concentrations about 78

163
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:39,478
parts per million that's just above

164
00:05:37,478 --> 00:05:42,199
what's needed to grow crops um but if

165
00:05:39,478 --> 00:05:43,800
you move up the slope you know where

166
00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:46,079
receiving more repeated applications of

167
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:48,360
seanor fertilizer we have much higher

168
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:49,959
soil phosphorus concentrations and so if

169
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:52,240
you just relate those soil phosphorus

170
00:05:49,959 --> 00:05:54,038
concentrations to the dissolv phosphorus

171
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:57,160
concentrations and runoff you get a you

172
00:05:54,038 --> 00:05:58,439
know increasing amounts of Doolan runoff

173
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:59,840
with higher soil phosphorus

174
00:05:58,439 --> 00:06:01,160
concentrations and that's a that's a

175
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:03,719
relationships have been shown over and

176
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:05,000
over in the literature but just because

177
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:06,680
we know that doesn't mean that we can

178
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,879
necessarily predict the load the load is

179
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:10,639
driven by uh the amount of runoff that's

180
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:11,879
generated from a particular Zone and so

181
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:13,960
when we look at the loads that we get

182
00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:16,038
from these regions it's really this

183
00:06:13,959 --> 00:06:18,079
region here just because of its

184
00:06:16,038 --> 00:06:19,639
high large amounts of runoff that are

185
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:20,959
gener the high volumes of runoff that we

186
00:06:19,639 --> 00:06:23,000
get those are where we see the high

187
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:24,680
loads and so these are areas of the

188
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,759
landscape that we call critical Source

189
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:29,598
areas um or hydrologically sensitive

190
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:30,879
areas that go by lots of names um but

191
00:06:29,598 --> 00:06:33,038
essentially the same thing you know

192
00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:35,399
where you have a source and a transport

193
00:06:33,038 --> 00:06:37,240
mechanism and it's in prox it's it's

194
00:06:35,399 --> 00:06:39,959
close to the stream and so you there's a

195
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:41,639
higher risk of phospherous loss uh from

196
00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:44,839
these regions of the

197
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:46,879
landscape so we've done some extra work

198
00:06:44,839 --> 00:06:49,000
looking at you know Z these zones of

199
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:50,680
saturation this is some work that Mark

200
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,160
Williams who was a PhD student at Penn

201
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:54,478
State was doing um you know well first

202
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:56,439
I'll just back up and just show that you

203
00:06:54,478 --> 00:06:58,439
these are kind of another look at these

204
00:06:56,439 --> 00:07:01,639
variable variably saturated areas in the

205
00:06:58,439 --> 00:07:04,319
landscape but um Mark came in um he set

206
00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:06,560
up a network of Pomers in these

207
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:09,319
saturated areas and this is the FD 36

208
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:11,199
Watershed just north of MN um also

209
00:07:09,319 --> 00:07:12,439
within the kind of the M Tanger Creek

210
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:15,120
experimental

211
00:07:12,439 --> 00:07:16,918
Weds and we used electrical resistivity

212
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:19,439
Imaging to try to understand a little

213
00:07:16,918 --> 00:07:20,598
bit about the subsurface connectivity

214
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:22,439
that we have you know what what

215
00:07:20,598 --> 00:07:24,519
maintains saturation in these in these

216
00:07:22,439 --> 00:07:25,879
portions of the landscape and so it's

217
00:07:24,519 --> 00:07:28,598
kind of fortuitous because we didn't do

218
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:30,759
it for for all that long uh we were only

219
00:07:28,598 --> 00:07:33,639
able to do it for one season essentially

220
00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:35,080
what you do is you is you use electrodes

221
00:07:33,639 --> 00:07:37,639
um in a transect here and you're

222
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:39,560
basically sending electric pulses um and

223
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:40,879
measuring you know certain between

224
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:42,800
current electrodes and potential

225
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:44,800
electrodes and you know changes in

226
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,759
resistivity can be used to infer changes

227
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,598
in soil moisture content um it's also

228
00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:50,520
sensitive to changes in soil

229
00:07:48,598 --> 00:07:52,959
temperature um and to any kind of

230
00:07:50,519 --> 00:07:54,439
conductive solution um but if you can

231
00:07:52,959 --> 00:07:56,198
control for the other things that affect

232
00:07:54,439 --> 00:07:57,879
it you can infer that you know what

233
00:07:56,199 --> 00:08:00,319
we're seeing is really due to changes in

234
00:07:57,879 --> 00:08:02,000
saturation um and so

235
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:03,400
we did some monitoring over a series of

236
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,360
storm events that that wet up the

237
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:07,638
landscape and so you can see here um you

238
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:10,598
know these are the where you see

239
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:13,800
decreased res resistivity um here and we

240
00:08:10,598 --> 00:08:15,839
know that we have a fragin uh just about

241
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:17,680
60 cmers below the surface you can see

242
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:19,198
that boundary really clearly so that

243
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,400
we're kind of concluding from this is

244
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,400
that this is the perch water that's

245
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:25,279
sitting above the frag pan this is an

246
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:26,519
area without a groundwater seep and then

247
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:28,559
we're comparing it to this Zone here

248
00:08:26,519 --> 00:08:29,680
where we have active seepage going on

249
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,680
and so when you look at the area where

250
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:34,599
we have a seep um where we have

251
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:37,158
upwelling water you can see um kind of a

252
00:08:34,599 --> 00:08:38,879
increased upward gradient of groundwater

253
00:08:37,158 --> 00:08:40,639
and we can infer this from the Pomers

254
00:08:38,879 --> 00:08:42,080
that we have here we have Peters at

255
00:08:40,639 --> 00:08:44,639
different depths that allow us to look

256
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:47,160
at gradients of of water movement and we

257
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:49,159
see evidence for you know this saturated

258
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:50,838
this connected saturated area here which

259
00:08:49,159 --> 00:08:52,120
you know when you compare when we

260
00:08:50,839 --> 00:08:53,200
combine it with this evidence it

261
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:55,519
suggests that this is an area of

262
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,040
upwelling water and seepage that we see

263
00:08:55,519 --> 00:09:00,078
in these

264
00:08:57,039 --> 00:09:01,480
zones and this is a video that I'm not

265
00:09:00,078 --> 00:09:03,078
sure if I'll be able to get to play but

266
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:06,399
this was taken during after a fairly

267
00:09:03,078 --> 00:09:09,239
large storm event um in this seage Zone

268
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:13,200
you can see the kind of see if it

269
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:17,879
works sometimes these things won't

270
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:21,879
work and of course it it will all right

271
00:09:17,879 --> 00:09:24,320
so that's kind of what you see

272
00:09:21,879 --> 00:09:25,919
um this is after I think this is after

273
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:28,160
tropical storm Le so when we had this is

274
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:31,000
a huge amount of rain it took to cause

275
00:09:28,159 --> 00:09:33,719
that kind of

276
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,480
so ERI is kind of valuable because it

277
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:36,639
allows you to as they say visualize I

278
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:38,000
mean you can get quantitative

279
00:09:36,639 --> 00:09:39,120
information from it too and I'll show

280
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,679
you some more work we're doing with

281
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:43,000
electrical resistivity Imaging later um

282
00:09:41,679 --> 00:09:45,159
but that was just some work looking at

283
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,720
just trying to get at the saturated or

284
00:09:45,159 --> 00:09:49,719
these um you know areas of connectivity

285
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:51,959
that you can see from with so

286
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:53,600
moisture so subsurface phospherous

287
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:55,679
transport is kind of an off to overlook

288
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:57,519
pathway um you a lot of it you know a

289
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:58,838
lot of the literature you know over time

290
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:00,320
has suggested most of the phospherous is

291
00:09:58,839 --> 00:10:02,480
moving it over land flow but we also see

292
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:05,440
a lot moving in subsurface flow and so

293
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:07,159
we've done work on a small dairy farm in

294
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:10,600
the alagan plateau

295
00:10:07,159 --> 00:10:13,278
region and this is Pete kleinman's work

296
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:15,879
uh where we were monitoring a spring

297
00:10:13,278 --> 00:10:18,439
house um so this is this is receiving

298
00:10:15,879 --> 00:10:20,240
subsurface flows from uh up there's

299
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:22,200
Fields above here uh that would be the

300
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:24,039
recharge area for the spring but it's

301
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:25,278
also uh where a lot of Manor applied

302
00:10:24,039 --> 00:10:26,919
this is a dairy farm so they're getting

303
00:10:25,278 --> 00:10:29,320
pretty frequent regular applications of

304
00:10:26,919 --> 00:10:31,120
dairy manure um this is the home here

305
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:32,600
here so this Spring House used to serve

306
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:35,000
water for the home it does it doesn't

307
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:36,079
any longer but um they actually helped

308
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,159
us do some monitoring they were

309
00:10:36,078 --> 00:10:39,519
collecting samples from the Spring House

310
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:41,278
over time and then keeping track of when

311
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:44,120
manure was being applied to the fields

312
00:10:41,278 --> 00:10:46,320
in the uh up gradient Zone above the

313
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:47,720
spring housee and so you can see you

314
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,200
know these are the days that manure

315
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:51,079
these are the you know Manor is kind of

316
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,480
Applied spring and fall so April October

317
00:10:51,078 --> 00:10:54,879
and these are the times of manure

318
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:57,200
application and here's the trace of

319
00:10:54,879 --> 00:10:59,000
dissolved phosphorus in the Springhouse

320
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:01,320
and so you can see soon after Manor

321
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,639
apply you you tend to get a spike get a

322
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:04,200
pretty significant Spike here and

323
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:05,480
dissolve phosphorus and then you know a

324
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,839
smaller one here and then another one

325
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:08,680
here so it's responding pretty quickly

326
00:11:06,839 --> 00:11:11,279
to the timing of an or application and

327
00:11:08,679 --> 00:11:14,278
you get these subsurface transfers of of

328
00:11:11,278 --> 00:11:16,480
phosphorus um you know so it's it's not

329
00:11:14,278 --> 00:11:19,559
just an Overland flow problem it's also

330
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:22,200
a subsurface transport

331
00:11:19,559 --> 00:11:25,159
problem things you can do to mitigate

332
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:27,720
that uh include uh just simple uh

333
00:11:25,159 --> 00:11:29,319
tillage uh so this is especially

334
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,600
problematic where we have no till and

335
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:32,360
you get a lot of soil development and

336
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:33,639
macropore formation you can come in with

337
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:35,879
frequent tillage and break up the

338
00:11:33,639 --> 00:11:37,600
macropores and the macropores are what's

339
00:11:35,879 --> 00:11:39,240
you know serving as the you know one

340
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,759
form of kind of Rapid connectivity

341
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:43,360
between the Surface and the subsurface

342
00:11:40,759 --> 00:11:45,078
and so one management tool is just to

343
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:47,240
till and you can see here just by

344
00:11:45,078 --> 00:11:48,919
tilling you can reduce um you know the

345
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:50,639
amount of dissolved phosphorus and leate

346
00:11:48,919 --> 00:11:52,958
relative to if you just broadcast on the

347
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:54,759
surface and it can connect uh to

348
00:11:52,958 --> 00:11:57,958
subsurface flow Pathways and so those

349
00:11:54,759 --> 00:12:00,480
are some things you can do to get at um

350
00:11:57,958 --> 00:12:03,679
reducing subsurface TR

351
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:05,200
transfers another common problem this is

352
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:06,799
kind of low hanging fruit stuff but

353
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,759
another common problem that we see you

354
00:12:06,799 --> 00:12:09,838
know this is some work we've doing on

355
00:12:08,759 --> 00:12:13,000
the

356
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:16,320
pedmont is just Barnyard runoff from

357
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:19,278
animal heavy heavy use areas um

358
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:21,480
so mean these are the kinds of you know

359
00:12:19,278 --> 00:12:23,198
these PL a lot of plain SE Farms down in

360
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:25,240
the pedmont region this is this is a

361
00:12:23,198 --> 00:12:27,759
manure this spilled manure here in the

362
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:29,600
barnyard area I mean just real simple

363
00:12:27,759 --> 00:12:31,000
things but but cause a major water

364
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:34,040
quality

365
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:36,000
problem and so this um here's some

366
00:12:34,039 --> 00:12:37,519
photos of kind of the the the condition

367
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,039
of the of some of these barnyards that

368
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:41,600
you see um lots of trampled uh you know

369
00:12:40,039 --> 00:12:44,039
animal heavy use areas so this is all

370
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:45,519
compacted soil um and I get a lot of run

371
00:12:44,039 --> 00:12:47,919
off just from the barn it's from the

372
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:49,320
roofs and these are impervious surface

373
00:12:47,919 --> 00:12:51,319
so you get a lot of runoff from these

374
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:53,240
zones and so we've been monitoring with

375
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:54,839
flumes just the the amount of runoff

376
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:56,839
that we get off these barnyards and also

377
00:12:54,839 --> 00:12:58,000
the quality of the water and so just in

378
00:12:56,839 --> 00:13:00,880
this small area we're generating

379
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,919
anywhere 20 kgs of phosphorus per year

380
00:13:00,879 --> 00:13:04,519
now the size of the Barnyard is really

381
00:13:02,919 --> 00:13:06,319
small so if you actually scaled that to

382
00:13:04,519 --> 00:13:08,039
like a kilograms per hectare per year

383
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:10,079
the the number is astronomical it seems

384
00:13:08,039 --> 00:13:12,039
almost unfair to report something so

385
00:13:10,078 --> 00:13:14,479
high but you get fairly substantial

386
00:13:12,039 --> 00:13:16,000
phosphorus losses from these barnyards

387
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,320
um and then what you have is basically

388
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,480
you know either some kind of Rapid

389
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:21,480
connection like a gully in this case

390
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:23,560
here so I mean that water just hits that

391
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:25,839
Gully and goes right down to a

392
00:13:23,559 --> 00:13:27,599
stream and so we've been working

393
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:29,519
actually with some kind of fancy

394
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:32,120
filtration Technologies to to try to

395
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:35,120
deal with this um it's one approach uh

396
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:37,879
so we're routing water uh into these you

397
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:40,120
know Bas Agro Jane inlets and it's

398
00:13:37,879 --> 00:13:41,720
moving in to a fairly sophisticated

399
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:43,159
system that's supposed to get at not

400
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:45,120
only nitrogen removal but also

401
00:13:43,159 --> 00:13:47,600
phosphorous removal this is um Alexandra

402
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:49,560
drio runs a um she she's been

403
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:51,320
experimenting a lot from with phosphorus

404
00:13:49,559 --> 00:13:53,958
filtration devices at the University of

405
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:56,160
Vermont so um this is one of per filters

406
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:58,559
using I think iron slag as the medium

407
00:13:56,159 --> 00:14:01,319
for phosphorus removal and so these

408
00:13:58,559 --> 00:14:03,000
things work when the flows are low but

409
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:05,959
when you get fairly large storms they

410
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,839
get overwhelmed um and so you're asking

411
00:14:05,958 --> 00:14:09,958
a lot of a of a system like this to

412
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:12,000
filter the sheer volumes of water that

413
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:14,319
are being generated from this kind of an

414
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,440
operation and so what we found is that

415
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:18,600
um probably what's needed is just better

416
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:20,440
Water Management like gutters and things

417
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:22,240
on the roofs and keeping the clean water

418
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:23,360
clean and separating that water from the

419
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:25,600
dirty water and then just trying to

420
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:27,278
treat smaller volumes of the really bad

421
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,680
stuff because this this gets clogged up

422
00:14:27,278 --> 00:14:30,399
with sediment it gets clogged up with

423
00:14:28,679 --> 00:14:33,239
manure

424
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:35,559
um it's interesting to look at but we've

425
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:38,159
had all kinds of problems with it um

426
00:14:35,559 --> 00:14:40,119
under big storms it just uh

427
00:14:38,159 --> 00:14:42,799
underperforms but so there's a role for

428
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:44,919
these things I think but uh water

429
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:46,359
management and just reducing the volumes

430
00:14:44,919 --> 00:14:47,919
of water coming off some of these sites

431
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:51,120
is kind of a low hanging fruit that I

432
00:14:47,919 --> 00:14:53,319
think you know would be would be

433
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:56,240
beneficial so kind of Shifting Gears a

434
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:58,320
little bit moving from the sloped areas

435
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,759
down into the coastal plan plain uh we

436
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:01,519
do a lot of work at the University of

437
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:04,120
Maryland Eastern Shores is on the delara

438
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:06,519
peninsula so this is uh the manin river

439
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:08,000
Watershed here and here is the

440
00:15:06,519 --> 00:15:08,879
University of Maryland Eastern Shore

441
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,078
within the

442
00:15:08,879 --> 00:15:14,039
manin we see some pretty extreme

443
00:15:11,078 --> 00:15:16,799
phosphorus losses in artificial drainage

444
00:15:14,039 --> 00:15:18,519
um at these sites anywhere from two

445
00:15:16,799 --> 00:15:21,120
kilograms per hectare per year all the

446
00:15:18,519 --> 00:15:23,198
way up to over 20 in some cases from

447
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:25,600
some of the ditches uh on the Eastern

448
00:15:23,198 --> 00:15:28,278
Shore and so that's kind of the main

449
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:30,000
issue um is the role of artificial

450
00:15:28,278 --> 00:15:32,439
drainage in BAS basically connecting

451
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:35,440
phosphorous sources to receiving Waters

452
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:37,240
and so drainage is is really critical um

453
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:40,240
in these flat Landscapes they use it to

454
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:41,720
lower water tables um lower they lower

455
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:43,639
them below the rooting zone so they can

456
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:46,920
grow crops and that there also they can

457
00:15:43,639 --> 00:15:48,000
get uh equipment out there but when you

458
00:15:46,919 --> 00:15:50,318
do

459
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,919
that um just the act of putting in a

460
00:15:50,318 --> 00:15:53,278
ditch or putting in a tile you know you

461
00:15:51,919 --> 00:15:55,559
lower the water table you increase the

462
00:15:53,278 --> 00:15:58,078
travel time of water in the system um

463
00:15:55,559 --> 00:15:59,719
and it also increases connectivity you

464
00:15:58,078 --> 00:16:01,318
dig that ditch deep and that's that's

465
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:04,120
kind of an active intensifying the

466
00:16:01,318 --> 00:16:05,879
drainage of the system and so uh in

467
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:07,600
another way there's two kind two ways to

468
00:16:05,879 --> 00:16:09,838
intensify the drainage one is to is to

469
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:11,278
dig the ditch deeper or to have the tile

470
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:13,440
installed at a deeper depth but also

471
00:16:11,278 --> 00:16:15,679
spacing plays a role so the more closely

472
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:18,040
spaced the ditches are the tiles are the

473
00:16:15,679 --> 00:16:21,439
more intense the drainage

474
00:16:18,039 --> 00:16:23,958
is another way to look at that um is

475
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:25,560
just in terms of drainage density and so

476
00:16:23,958 --> 00:16:26,638
it's kind of like a watershed hydrology

477
00:16:25,559 --> 00:16:28,278
approach where you just look at the

478
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:30,600
length of the channels in the system

479
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:32,759
divided by the area um and a lot of

480
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:35,680
folks have kind of looked at it this way

481
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:38,240
uh and so in this case here you have a

482
00:16:35,679 --> 00:16:41,000
27 acre field and these are the existing

483
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:42,600
ditches in the field here um and so if

484
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,839
you calculate the drainage density you

485
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:45,839
know based on the area of the field and

486
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:47,680
the length of ditches it's about 02

487
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:50,120
meters to the

488
00:16:47,679 --> 00:16:52,120
ne1 the critical Source areas of

489
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:54,440
phosphorus contribution to these ditches

490
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:56,360
are largely pretty close to the ditch

491
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:57,680
they're within 5 or 10 meters or so and

492
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:59,000
some of this evidence is from Tracer

493
00:16:57,679 --> 00:17:00,359
studies that have been done elsewhere

494
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,919
just looking at you know where's the

495
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:04,439
contributing area that kind of the

496
00:17:01,919 --> 00:17:06,599
annual you know contributing area to

497
00:17:04,439 --> 00:17:06,600
these

498
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:10,879
ditches if you intensify the drainage

499
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:12,880
which is going on quite a bit on the

500
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:14,919
Eastern Shore in other words if you just

501
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:17,600
add more tiles or more ditches to the

502
00:17:14,919 --> 00:17:19,720
system um basically you've just

503
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:21,918
increased not only the connectivity of

504
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:25,240
the system but also oops let me back up

505
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:26,480
SEC um but just you know you increase

506
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:28,960
the contribution of phosphorus from

507
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:30,640
areas that were not initially connected

508
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:32,360
now they are connected you're connecting

509
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,960
new phosphorous sources to drainage and

510
00:17:32,359 --> 00:17:36,079
more rapidly removing water from the

511
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:37,558
system um and so you've just increased

512
00:17:36,079 --> 00:17:39,720
the air the spatial coverage of critical

513
00:17:37,558 --> 00:17:40,720
Source areas across uh the Basin I know

514
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:43,200
a lot of work's been done here at

515
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:44,640
Cornell looking at road side ditches and

516
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,038
so this is kind of a similar thing

517
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,480
you're just increasing the artificial

518
00:17:46,038 --> 00:17:49,599
connectivity of the system and more

519
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:51,200
rapidly delivering nutrients uh to

520
00:17:49,599 --> 00:17:53,119
streams and so this is kind of you know

521
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:55,080
this is the ditch drainage for

522
00:17:53,119 --> 00:17:56,759
agriculture problem but there's also the

523
00:17:55,079 --> 00:17:58,199
roadside you know ditch problem that I

524
00:17:56,759 --> 00:18:01,158
know there's been quite a lot of work

525
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:03,679
been done here looking at that issue

526
00:18:01,159 --> 00:18:04,679
Keith Schilling uh in the midwest did

527
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:06,360
some really interesting work just

528
00:18:04,679 --> 00:18:08,559
looking at the role of drainage density

529
00:18:06,359 --> 00:18:10,038
increasing the density of drainage on

530
00:18:08,558 --> 00:18:11,558
travel times and basically showed that

531
00:18:10,038 --> 00:18:14,558
there's an exponential relationship

532
00:18:11,558 --> 00:18:17,678
between uh the the mean travel time and

533
00:18:14,558 --> 00:18:19,960
years and and the drainage density of

534
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:22,240
artificial drainage of either tiles or

535
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:24,159
ditches and so you can see you know at

536
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:25,679
first if you start to you know rapidly

537
00:18:24,159 --> 00:18:27,039
increase the density of drainage there's

538
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:28,759
a pretty steep drop off but then it

539
00:18:27,038 --> 00:18:30,200
levels off to a point where you can keep

540
00:18:28,759 --> 00:18:31,759
keep adding tiles or keep adding ditches

541
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:33,319
and there's not much you know change in

542
00:18:31,759 --> 00:18:35,640
travel time but it's a pretty steep drop

543
00:18:33,319 --> 00:18:37,798
in travel time you know say 15 years or

544
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:40,400
so from you know just this you know from

545
00:18:37,798 --> 00:18:43,079
going 0.1 to 0.2 so you can change the

546
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:45,120
travel times more rapidly move water off

547
00:18:43,079 --> 00:18:46,639
the site but that's also a problem for

548
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:49,678
you know phosphorus pollution and

549
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:49,679
nitrogen pollution as

550
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:55,440
well these are some data from Kevin King

551
00:18:53,079 --> 00:18:57,359
in the midwest just showing um how

552
00:18:55,440 --> 00:19:00,320
quickly phosphorus responds in tile

553
00:18:57,359 --> 00:19:02,079
drainage um and so it's almost like a

554
00:19:00,319 --> 00:19:04,158
you you get these really rapid responses

555
00:19:02,079 --> 00:19:05,599
you know where you get upticks in flow

556
00:19:04,159 --> 00:19:08,159
and then phosphorus responds right away

557
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:10,319
so it just suggests very fast delivery

558
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:11,679
of phosphorus to the system and so if

559
00:19:10,319 --> 00:19:14,599
you combine that with evidence from

560
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:17,038
Marty shipo the US and others have done

561
00:19:14,599 --> 00:19:19,199
this too um where they've taken smoke

562
00:19:17,038 --> 00:19:21,480
machines and just blown smoke up the

563
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:23,798
tile lines to find uh macropores and

564
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:26,360
soils it just shows how well connected

565
00:19:23,798 --> 00:19:28,279
these tiles are uh to these you know

566
00:19:26,359 --> 00:19:30,359
small these macropore systems that form

567
00:19:28,279 --> 00:19:32,038
and especially no till soils and so you

568
00:19:30,359 --> 00:19:33,798
just have rapid conveyance of phosphorus

569
00:19:32,038 --> 00:19:35,158
either Manor or soil phosphorus and it

570
00:19:33,798 --> 00:19:36,639
gets delivered straight down the

571
00:19:35,159 --> 00:19:38,880
macropores into the tiles and so you

572
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:41,038
have very rapid delivery of phosphorus

573
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,799
out of these tiles um and so it's a

574
00:19:41,038 --> 00:19:45,200
common problem in the Midwest and it's

575
00:19:42,798 --> 00:19:46,639
in part contributing to the lake Eerie

576
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:49,440
situation that you've probably all heard

577
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:51,480
about the toxic algal blooms a lot of

578
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:53,960
that phosphorus delivery is is in part

579
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:56,120
being contributed by the tile drainage

580
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:57,600
that's there and the rapid expansion and

581
00:19:56,119 --> 00:20:00,639
intensification of tile drainage that's

582
00:19:57,599 --> 00:20:00,639
going on throughout the Midwest

583
00:20:01,798 --> 00:20:05,879
back on the kind of the coastal plane we

584
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:09,000
see very similar kind of response in our

585
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:10,760
ditches um so you see you know Fair

586
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,000
large storm event here in one of our

587
00:20:10,759 --> 00:20:14,558
field ditches and a very rapid response

588
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,720
you know in phosphorus concentration is

589
00:20:14,558 --> 00:20:19,399
really rapid rise right with it timed

590
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:22,000
with the peak of the hydrograph it's

591
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:23,720
about you know 1.5 milligrams per liter

592
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,880
so it suggests very you know fast flow

593
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:28,319
paths it Peaks early in the hydrograph

594
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:29,679
and we've looked uh you know across the

595
00:20:28,319 --> 00:20:30,918
land you know some there's been some

596
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:32,798
suggestion that you know groundwater's

597
00:20:30,919 --> 00:20:34,600
playing a big role and so like we have a

598
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:37,279
lot of Wells say and these are the this

599
00:20:34,599 --> 00:20:38,079
is actually the ditch this is this ditch

600
00:20:37,279 --> 00:20:40,000
right here that goes through these

601
00:20:38,079 --> 00:20:41,639
fields we have just a fairly dense

602
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,519
network of shallow welds measuring kind

603
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:46,400
of the groundwater concentrations of

604
00:20:43,519 --> 00:20:49,000
phosphorus um in the system and if you

605
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:50,919
look uh you know they're on the order of

606
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,640
you know at the most maybe3 milligrams

607
00:20:50,919 --> 00:20:54,000
per liter on average this is kind of

608
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:56,559
collecting data once every two weeks

609
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,919
throughout the year um you know the mean

610
00:20:56,558 --> 00:21:00,240
is more on the order of 0.5 and so if

611
00:20:58,919 --> 00:21:02,120
you just think about this in a mixing

612
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:05,279
model context as this being one of your

613
00:21:02,119 --> 00:21:07,678
end members uh of phosphorus it's

614
00:21:05,279 --> 00:21:09,119
unlikely that groundwater is you know

615
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:10,038
alone you know is the big Source even

616
00:21:09,119 --> 00:21:11,359
though these ditches are largely

617
00:21:10,038 --> 00:21:12,679
draining the groundwater system so there

618
00:21:11,359 --> 00:21:14,759
has to be another source that's

619
00:21:12,679 --> 00:21:16,200
contributing uh to these fairly high

620
00:21:14,759 --> 00:21:18,319
peaks of phosphorus that we routinely

621
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:20,080
see about 1.5 up to sometimes two or

622
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:21,678
three milligrams per liter in these

623
00:21:20,079 --> 00:21:24,639
storm

624
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:26,759
events and so work that Pete vodis who

625
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:28,679
was with a he was with our group for a

626
00:21:26,759 --> 00:21:31,440
while as a postto but now he's in the uh

627
00:21:28,679 --> 00:21:33,919
at the Wisconsin ARS unit um he had a

628
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:35,320
network of shallow Wells installed at

629
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:38,278
different depths throughout the site and

630
00:21:35,319 --> 00:21:40,240
what you see uh is that there's a

631
00:21:38,278 --> 00:21:41,880
shallow either a perch system or

632
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:44,640
preferential flow Pathways that that

633
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:46,080
rapid rapidly deliver very high

634
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,679
concentrations of phosphorus sometimes

635
00:21:46,079 --> 00:21:50,480
in the order of 10 parts per million or

636
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:52,360
more uh you know in the upper foot upper

637
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,798
foot and a half say of soil that's you

638
00:21:52,359 --> 00:21:56,519
either get these high water tables in

639
00:21:53,798 --> 00:21:58,158
the spring that form so March April

640
00:21:56,519 --> 00:21:59,639
right now the you know the water table

641
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:01,520
down at University mation Shores

642
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:02,880
probably within a foot of the surface

643
00:22:01,519 --> 00:22:04,440
and so you get these storm events that

644
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:06,360
just move water very rapidly and they

645
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:08,840
tend to have very high concentrations of

646
00:22:06,359 --> 00:22:10,439
phosphorus um and that's most likely

647
00:22:08,839 --> 00:22:12,319
what we believe is the is the

648
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:13,960
contributing source of phosphorus that's

649
00:22:12,319 --> 00:22:15,519
where your highest phosphor phosphorus

650
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:18,200
concentrations and soil are usually in

651
00:22:15,519 --> 00:22:20,599
the upper foot so we have concentrations

652
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:23,159
of say 300 parts per million in that

653
00:22:20,599 --> 00:22:25,439
upper foot so that's essentially where

654
00:22:23,159 --> 00:22:27,320
we see you know most of the phosphorus

655
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:31,120
moving so you know Pete kimman has done

656
00:22:27,319 --> 00:22:32,599
some work uh down on at UMES and it's

657
00:22:31,119 --> 00:22:34,599
kind of a mass balance approach where we

658
00:22:32,599 --> 00:22:37,480
had edge of field flumes looking at the

659
00:22:34,599 --> 00:22:38,959
volume of water and Overland flow and um

660
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:40,319
the you know the loads that were being

661
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,880
delivered and also you can measure the

662
00:22:40,319 --> 00:22:43,918
loads in the ditch and by difference you

663
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:46,159
can infer that almost 92% of the

664
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:48,360
phospherous is probably moving in the

665
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:51,840
subsurface um that's kind of just a mass

666
00:22:48,359 --> 00:22:53,119
balance uh look at it um and just based

667
00:22:51,839 --> 00:22:54,879
on some other evidence you know we're

668
00:22:53,119 --> 00:22:56,479
inferring that you know the most the

669
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:58,880
riskiest sources for phosphorous

670
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:01,240
delivery to these ditches is probably

671
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:02,760
within 5 to 10 meters of the ditch and

672
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:04,400
as you move further away the travel

673
00:23:02,759 --> 00:23:06,960
times are long and it's unlikely that

674
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:09,840
they're contributing much um least on a

675
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:12,159
kind of a regular basis um to these

676
00:23:09,839 --> 00:23:14,240
ditches so we've gone in we're planning

677
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:17,080
to go in and and and do some electrical

678
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:18,319
resistivity Imaging um at these sites

679
00:23:17,079 --> 00:23:20,359
too because we're interested in trying

680
00:23:18,319 --> 00:23:23,319
to understand more about these shallow

681
00:23:20,359 --> 00:23:25,038
subsurface flow Pathways that are active

682
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:26,519
and so here we're going in with tracers

683
00:23:25,038 --> 00:23:28,000
um and using the electrical resistivity

684
00:23:26,519 --> 00:23:30,278
Imaging and the tracers to tell us

685
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,720
something about um shallow subsurface

686
00:23:30,278 --> 00:23:34,640
flow Pathways so this is just a test

687
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:35,960
study really we didn't we intend to do

688
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:37,320
this under storm conditions but here

689
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:38,440
we're just kind of testing it out just

690
00:23:37,319 --> 00:23:41,038
to make sure we know what we're doing

691
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:44,000
we're working with a team from ruers um

692
00:23:41,038 --> 00:23:46,599
to do this and so this is Ray Bryant

693
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:49,079
actually so he Ray was here at Cornell

694
00:23:46,599 --> 00:23:50,918
for uh for a good part of his career

695
00:23:49,079 --> 00:23:53,759
he's now working with us at ARS he's

696
00:23:50,919 --> 00:23:57,278
spraying a concentrated salt solution of

697
00:23:53,759 --> 00:23:59,480
about 5 misean um per centimeter so of

698
00:23:57,278 --> 00:24:01,960
um just sodium chloride

699
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:04,240
uh onto this plot here we also are

700
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:05,360
injecting uh the solution into Wells

701
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:07,400
we're just trying to get a response

702
00:24:05,359 --> 00:24:10,038
basically just to see if the ER can tell

703
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:12,000
us anything about uh movement of water

704
00:24:10,038 --> 00:24:13,720
and so we're spraying that and we're

705
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,759
basically doing time-lapse ER collecting

706
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:17,960
these images of resistivity and you can

707
00:24:15,759 --> 00:24:19,440
see you know these areas of lower

708
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:21,240
resistivity this is where your your

709
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:24,000
highly conductive solution is starting

710
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:25,319
to infiltrate and starting to move you

711
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,720
know and you can kind of look at it over

712
00:24:25,319 --> 00:24:29,240
time you're taking these different time

713
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:31,319
lapse images and you can just see

714
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:33,319
the advancement of a salt plume you know

715
00:24:31,319 --> 00:24:34,319
in the subsurface so we want to

716
00:24:33,319 --> 00:24:36,639
understand a little bit what I mean the

717
00:24:34,319 --> 00:24:38,158
goal is really to understand you know

718
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:39,640
how these subsurface flow PL ways

719
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:41,480
develop how long does it take them to

720
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:42,960
get from the field to the ditch and you

721
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:45,120
can actually get I mean the images are

722
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:46,640
nice you can get you can do 3D you know

723
00:24:45,119 --> 00:24:48,359
videos of these things of the of the

724
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:49,799
salt tracers but you can actually derive

725
00:24:48,359 --> 00:24:52,599
quantitative information from the

726
00:24:49,798 --> 00:24:53,798
time-lapse Z and so we're interested in

727
00:24:52,599 --> 00:24:55,519
understanding more about the Hydraulics

728
00:24:53,798 --> 00:24:58,639
of the system so the you know the

729
00:24:55,519 --> 00:25:00,359
conductivity of of the soils uh the tra

730
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:02,480
times and some of the other quantitative

731
00:25:00,359 --> 00:25:03,959
hydrologic information you can get um

732
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:07,440
from these kinds of images and so we

733
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:10,840
plan to go out this spring we hope uh

734
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:12,480
and inject tracers um and do it under

735
00:25:10,839 --> 00:25:14,480
storm conditions when we expect these

736
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:17,798
shallow flow Pathways to be active and

737
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:19,720
to track them and based on some kind of

738
00:25:17,798 --> 00:25:22,278
advanced modeling that we've been doing

739
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:24,240
um it we expect to have to do this over

740
00:25:22,278 --> 00:25:25,640
a series of Storms and we thought maybe

741
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:27,079
one storm will be enough to just move it

742
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:29,360
from the field to the ditch but it turns

743
00:25:27,079 --> 00:25:30,918
out that the travel times are quite slow

744
00:25:29,359 --> 00:25:33,918
even just within 5 or 10 meters of the

745
00:25:30,919 --> 00:25:35,360
ditch you're talking tens of days to or

746
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:36,720
longer you know for some of this stuff

747
00:25:35,359 --> 00:25:38,678
to potentially move so we could be

748
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:40,240
looking at probably weeks and weeks of

749
00:25:38,679 --> 00:25:42,440
time-lapse Imaging to try to see how

750
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:44,960
long it takes you know the salt to move

751
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:45,960
and also where it's moving and that

752
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,200
might tell us a little bit something

753
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:49,159
about the pathways that are active and

754
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:50,759
might be also moving phosphorus from the

755
00:25:49,159 --> 00:25:54,240
field to the

756
00:25:50,759 --> 00:25:56,240
ditch there's an issue of infrastructure

757
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:57,919
intensification um on the Eastern Shore

758
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:59,839
so just basically real simple things

759
00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:01,440
like the the poultry industry on the

760
00:25:59,839 --> 00:26:02,959
Eastern Shore is concentrating and so

761
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:04,679
you're they're constructing a lot of

762
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:06,759
what they call these zero Acre Farms

763
00:26:04,679 --> 00:26:08,919
where it's just poultry litter sheds

764
00:26:06,759 --> 00:26:10,519
they're not growing crops they're just

765
00:26:08,919 --> 00:26:13,440
producing poultry and producing a lot of

766
00:26:10,519 --> 00:26:14,918
manure um and so you know you take a

767
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:17,080
site like this where you know this is a

768
00:26:14,919 --> 00:26:18,278
kind of a before picture of the about

769
00:26:17,079 --> 00:26:19,480
you know using the curve number kind of

770
00:26:18,278 --> 00:26:21,640
the amount of runoff the amount of storm

771
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:24,278
water you would generate on on a site

772
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:26,200
and now you know you add 4 600 foot by

773
00:26:24,278 --> 00:26:28,679
66 foot poultry

774
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:30,600
barns you've jacked up probably just

775
00:26:28,679 --> 00:26:33,000
because of the you know uh impervious

776
00:26:30,599 --> 00:26:34,319
surface generate you know from the barns

777
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,558
you know 40% increase in the amount of

778
00:26:34,319 --> 00:26:36,879
runoff and that runoff has to go

779
00:26:35,558 --> 00:26:39,038
somewhere so you have you know these

780
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:40,880
ditches you know that are probably you

781
00:26:39,038 --> 00:26:44,278
know going to convey more flow and

782
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:45,960
probably increase the loads um of of say

783
00:26:44,278 --> 00:26:48,319
phosphorus in in in a landscape that's

784
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:49,840
already phosphorous saturated so um this

785
00:26:48,319 --> 00:26:51,158
kind of intensification is going on

786
00:26:49,839 --> 00:26:53,398
quite a bit you know the more we drive

787
00:26:51,159 --> 00:26:55,480
down to the UMES we always see new areas

788
00:26:53,398 --> 00:26:57,519
of barns going up

789
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:58,720
so and these are the issues that you

790
00:26:57,519 --> 00:27:00,278
know that we're concerned Le about is

791
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:02,200
just water management just in and around

792
00:27:00,278 --> 00:27:04,359
the barn so this is a this is an example

793
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:06,200
just from um where I mean they' have

794
00:27:04,359 --> 00:27:07,359
these kinds of water management problems

795
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:09,600
where you just have a lot of water

796
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:11,599
coming off the barn and actually there

797
00:27:09,599 --> 00:27:14,000
was a this particular practice was

798
00:27:11,599 --> 00:27:16,158
subsidized by the state of Maryland um

799
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:19,119
it's not performing all that well and

800
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:22,278
the consequences of that are it's let me

801
00:27:19,119 --> 00:27:24,719
back up this here is what you'll see is

802
00:27:22,278 --> 00:27:28,558
Ditch 8 it's um also the ditch that is

803
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:29,960
responsible for about 20 some 25 or so

804
00:27:28,558 --> 00:27:32,599
kilograms per hectare per year of

805
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:34,840
phosphorus loss just in that ditch Alone

806
00:27:32,599 --> 00:27:36,519
um and it's because it's this is the

807
00:27:34,839 --> 00:27:38,398
shed that was Dripping all that water

808
00:27:36,519 --> 00:27:39,519
and it also has a it's a poultry L

809
00:27:38,398 --> 00:27:41,359
Storage set so it's just these low

810
00:27:39,519 --> 00:27:43,119
hanging fruit kind of problems where you

811
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:44,918
if you do a better job uh managing the

812
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:47,158
water you hopefully could do a better

813
00:27:44,919 --> 00:27:50,080
job of at least reducing these just

814
00:27:47,159 --> 00:27:51,840
substantially High losses of phosphorus

815
00:27:50,079 --> 00:27:54,278
that that we

816
00:27:51,839 --> 00:27:56,000
get so I'll say a little bit about

817
00:27:54,278 --> 00:27:57,159
instream processes because there's been

818
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,640
you know quite a bit of work done just

819
00:27:57,159 --> 00:28:01,200
trying to understand phospher

820
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:02,640
movement in streams um you know most of

821
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:04,278
what we do you know we kind of we do

822
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:06,519
work at say one scale say like a hill

823
00:28:04,278 --> 00:28:09,119
slip scale you know we may be monitoring

824
00:28:06,519 --> 00:28:10,319
also at the small Watershed scale also

825
00:28:09,119 --> 00:28:12,319
maybe at a large so these are kind of a

826
00:28:10,319 --> 00:28:13,599
nested Watershed kind of approach but

827
00:28:12,319 --> 00:28:15,398
we're really interested in you know

828
00:28:13,599 --> 00:28:16,599
what's going on how these connect how

829
00:28:15,398 --> 00:28:18,000
these different scales connect and

830
00:28:16,599 --> 00:28:19,000
what's going on in the streams to help

831
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,839
move

832
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:23,038
phosphorus and so this is some work that

833
00:28:20,839 --> 00:28:26,038
rich McDow did um with Andrew sharpley

834
00:28:23,038 --> 00:28:27,558
in the f36 Watershed just looking at you

835
00:28:26,038 --> 00:28:29,079
know the different controls of Base flow

836
00:28:27,558 --> 00:28:31,918
and storm flow flow on phosphorus

837
00:28:29,079 --> 00:28:33,639
movement in streams and so here you see

838
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:36,159
phosphorus concentrations at four

839
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:38,559
different flumes and f36 and at base

840
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:40,240
flow the concentrations tend to increase

841
00:28:38,558 --> 00:28:41,960
um and this has been attributed just to

842
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:44,319
the you the absorption capacity of the

843
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:46,278
of the stream sediments um high capacity

844
00:28:44,319 --> 00:28:49,079
to disorb phosphorus here and decreasing

845
00:28:46,278 --> 00:28:49,079
capacity As you move

846
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:54,000
Downstream and you can contrast that

847
00:28:51,759 --> 00:28:55,398
with what you see during storms where

848
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,278
you have kind of the opposite more of a

849
00:28:55,398 --> 00:28:59,119
dilution effect basically as you go

850
00:28:57,278 --> 00:29:01,679
Downstream so phosphorous concentrations

851
00:28:59,119 --> 00:29:04,398
in stream water tend to decline during

852
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:05,919
storms and that's largely due to having

853
00:29:04,398 --> 00:29:07,518
kind of a basically a critical Source

854
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:09,080
are phosphorus loss here where you have

855
00:29:07,519 --> 00:29:11,240
a lot of runoff generation and high

856
00:29:09,079 --> 00:29:12,639
phosphorus concentration in soils and

857
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:14,278
then that signal kind of being diluted

858
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:16,399
As you move

859
00:29:14,278 --> 00:29:18,038
Downstream but you know when you kind of

860
00:29:16,398 --> 00:29:20,079
just consider what are the the annual

861
00:29:18,038 --> 00:29:23,839
export patterns of phosphorus you know

862
00:29:20,079 --> 00:29:25,960
in streams most of our flows um are you

863
00:29:23,839 --> 00:29:28,759
know base flows 90% of the flows in any

864
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:31,159
given year um you know W3 would be

865
00:29:28,759 --> 00:29:33,440
classified as base flow and maybe 10% of

866
00:29:31,159 --> 00:29:36,278
the flows you would classify as as storm

867
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:37,840
flows this is just of you know in terms

868
00:29:36,278 --> 00:29:40,278
of time just 10% of the time we have

869
00:29:37,839 --> 00:29:41,759
storm flow but the annual export you

870
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:43,359
know is largely driven by storm flow so

871
00:29:41,759 --> 00:29:45,079
70% of the phosphorus loss is occurring

872
00:29:43,359 --> 00:29:46,439
in storms and maybe only 30% or so in

873
00:29:45,079 --> 00:29:48,319
base flow so it's you know it's kind of

874
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:49,480
this unequal distribution of you know

875
00:29:48,319 --> 00:29:50,918
phosphorous slots it's occurring at

876
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:53,480
small amount of small portion of the

877
00:29:50,919 --> 00:29:56,399
time and at the highest

878
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:57,640
flows and there's an interesting study

879
00:29:56,398 --> 00:29:59,000
uh you know so and a lot of that you

880
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:00,679
know a lot of that phosphorous losses is

881
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,519
is particulate too so it's um it's

882
00:30:00,679 --> 00:30:03,840
moving you know with with sediment so

883
00:30:02,519 --> 00:30:05,759
there was an interesting study that came

884
00:30:03,839 --> 00:30:08,439
out in Water Resources research from a

885
00:30:05,759 --> 00:30:11,000
group led by uh I think pizo out of

886
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:12,960
Delaware looking at just how long does

887
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,319
it take a sediment and you know by you

888
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:15,960
know by extension they're also including

889
00:30:14,319 --> 00:30:18,158
things like particulate phosphorus to

890
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:19,880
move uh from some of these wers sheds

891
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:21,159
say to the ches beake bay and so I just

892
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:23,360
picked one of the watersheds where they

893
00:30:21,159 --> 00:30:24,640
worked uh the little Koga Creek because

894
00:30:23,359 --> 00:30:26,759
it's in the chese bay and it's really

895
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:28,519
interesting because you know if you just

896
00:30:26,759 --> 00:30:30,640
think of sediment transport you know in

897
00:30:28,519 --> 00:30:32,480
the suspended sentiment transport it's

898
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:34,320
pretty fast you know storms can move at

899
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:36,319
quite a distance but you know they they

900
00:30:34,319 --> 00:30:37,480
ran some you know theoretical sediment

901
00:30:36,319 --> 00:30:39,480
transport models where they actually

902
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:41,240
tried to account for the role of storage

903
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:43,319
say in flood planes and other areas of

904
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:44,880
the stream system and it's pretty

905
00:30:43,319 --> 00:30:46,398
fascinating and these are theoretical

906
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:48,559
models so they still need to be tested

907
00:30:46,398 --> 00:30:50,119
you know uh but it if you account for

908
00:30:48,558 --> 00:30:51,960
the time spent in storage the time

909
00:30:50,119 --> 00:30:53,439
average velocity of silk clay which is

910
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:55,919
probably the the size fraction that's

911
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:59,720
mostly moving a lot of the particular PE

912
00:30:55,919 --> 00:31:01,240
it's about 02 kilm per year and if you

913
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:03,120
can just consider that you know it's at

914
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:04,720
80 kilometers you know between say that

915
00:31:03,119 --> 00:31:06,839
stream and the mouth of the ches Peake

916
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:09,480
Bay you're looking at you know greater

917
00:31:06,839 --> 00:31:11,798
than 600 years to move phosphorus from

918
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:13,240
that stream down to the Bay now this is

919
00:31:11,798 --> 00:31:14,398
you know based on some of the modeling

920
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:15,880
work and they're actually going back and

921
00:31:14,398 --> 00:31:17,599
looking with different kinds of tracers

922
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:20,639
to to corroborate what their models

923
00:31:17,599 --> 00:31:21,879
suggest but it suggests Millennia in

924
00:31:20,638 --> 00:31:24,000
some of these for some of these streams

925
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:25,080
to really move a lot of that phosphorus

926
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,839
and it's just another one of these

927
00:31:25,079 --> 00:31:28,199
system lags that's built you know that's

928
00:31:26,839 --> 00:31:29,480
built in that you know so they're

929
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:31,200
looking at it from the best management

930
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:33,240
practice standpoint if you put in bmps

931
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:35,558
to control sediment and eroded

932
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:37,200
phosphorus loss how long is it going to

933
00:31:35,558 --> 00:31:38,759
take before that signal propagates down

934
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:40,240
say to the bay and they're you know

935
00:31:38,759 --> 00:31:42,558
based on their work they're saying you

936
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:45,000
know many many decades to hundreds of

937
00:31:42,558 --> 00:31:46,278
years or more before you might see some

938
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,480
of that so that's I just thought that

939
00:31:46,278 --> 00:31:50,038
was kind of

940
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:52,480
interesting there's a really big issue

941
00:31:50,038 --> 00:31:55,038
uh that you've probably heard about uh

942
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:58,278
with the Kingo Dam and so I thought I'd

943
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:59,919
touch on that a little bit here uh

944
00:31:58,278 --> 00:32:02,079
specifically related to Tropical Storm

945
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:04,799
Lee which was a huge storm that occurred

946
00:32:02,079 --> 00:32:06,599
September 7th to the 15th in 2011 one of

947
00:32:04,798 --> 00:32:08,200
the one of the bigger floods that we've

948
00:32:06,599 --> 00:32:09,558
experienced in the Squan drainage so

949
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:12,360
this just shows the the kind of the

950
00:32:09,558 --> 00:32:15,278
cumulative precipitation that fell uh

951
00:32:12,359 --> 00:32:17,038
across the region you know anywhere uh

952
00:32:15,278 --> 00:32:18,599
you know six or eight inches or more of

953
00:32:17,038 --> 00:32:20,480
rainfall and here you can see the

954
00:32:18,599 --> 00:32:22,519
sediment plume that you know that was in

955
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:24,960
response to that huge

956
00:32:22,519 --> 00:32:28,359
flood and this is some work out of from

957
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:30,840
Bob hirs the USGS just showing the

958
00:32:28,359 --> 00:32:33,959
amount of phosphorus um that was lost in

959
00:32:30,839 --> 00:32:37,558
that one single event and

960
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:40,120
so here's the total phosphorus loss uh

961
00:32:37,558 --> 00:32:42,200
61% of the phosphorus load in 2011 was

962
00:32:40,119 --> 00:32:44,558
attributed to Tropical Storm Lee so just

963
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:45,720
so just for one year 61% of load from

964
00:32:44,558 --> 00:32:48,398
one

965
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:50,200
event as a percent as a fraction of the

966
00:32:48,398 --> 00:32:52,038
last decade the last 10 years it was it

967
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:55,319
accounted for 22% of the phosphorous

968
00:32:52,038 --> 00:32:58,879
loss and this is at Kingo this is where

969
00:32:55,319 --> 00:33:01,798
these data are coming from and uh 9% of

970
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:04,760
the loss over the last say 35 years the

971
00:33:01,798 --> 00:33:05,679
period of record that he looked at 1978

972
00:33:04,759 --> 00:33:08,079
to

973
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:09,278
2011 and so you know those of a sar

974
00:33:08,079 --> 00:33:11,480
group and elsewhere you know we've kind

975
00:33:09,278 --> 00:33:13,558
of been calling hingo Dam as like the

976
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:15,360
world's greatest BMP because it traps

977
00:33:13,558 --> 00:33:17,158
setam in it traps a lot of phosphorus

978
00:33:15,359 --> 00:33:21,079
and it's kind of you know this this

979
00:33:17,159 --> 00:33:24,799
barrier between the Susan River and the

980
00:33:21,079 --> 00:33:26,158
ches Peake Bay Downstream of it um but

981
00:33:24,798 --> 00:33:28,638
perhaps it could be considered one of

982
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:31,559
the single greatest sources of Legacy

983
00:33:28,638 --> 00:33:34,119
phosphorus to the chest beak Bay um

984
00:33:31,558 --> 00:33:36,519
because you're getting it it's cap its

985
00:33:34,119 --> 00:33:37,959
capacity is it's almost reached capacity

986
00:33:36,519 --> 00:33:39,399
uh the sediment stored behind the dam

987
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:41,440
it's it's become almost kind of a pass

988
00:33:39,398 --> 00:33:43,079
through now where it's accumulated so

989
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:44,120
much sediment that now just stuff is

990
00:33:43,079 --> 00:33:46,918
passing through it's not really

991
00:33:44,119 --> 00:33:49,119
depositing much behind uh the dam

992
00:33:46,919 --> 00:33:50,880
anymore um and so one thing that's

993
00:33:49,119 --> 00:33:52,000
happened that you know Bob hirs reported

994
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:54,120
is that there's been a change in their

995
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:56,159
concentration discharge relationship um

996
00:33:54,119 --> 00:33:57,798
you know for between flow and phosphorus

997
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:59,159
and so now you're getting much higher

998
00:33:57,798 --> 00:34:00,759
concentrations of phosphorus for the

999
00:33:59,159 --> 00:34:02,559
same flow so some of these larger storms

1000
00:34:00,759 --> 00:34:04,480
now are generating much higher

1001
00:34:02,558 --> 00:34:06,839
concentrations of phosphorus than they

1002
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:09,240
did say in the past and so here's this

1003
00:34:06,839 --> 00:34:10,918
is Lee here you've got concentrations of

1004
00:34:09,239 --> 00:34:12,678
over two milligrams per liter coming out

1005
00:34:10,918 --> 00:34:15,559
where storms of similar magnitude in the

1006
00:34:12,679 --> 00:34:17,720
past would have produced such a high

1007
00:34:15,559 --> 00:34:20,039
concentration and work out of John's

1008
00:34:17,719 --> 00:34:21,759
Hopkins has also shown kind of an uptick

1009
00:34:20,039 --> 00:34:23,878
in total p and this is largely explained

1010
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:25,639
by particulate phosphorus contribution

1011
00:34:23,878 --> 00:34:27,960
there's also scour going on behind the

1012
00:34:25,639 --> 00:34:29,440
dam too it's another issue because it's

1013
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:30,918
full so you're seeing kind of an uptick

1014
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:33,960
you had a decline here in total

1015
00:34:30,918 --> 00:34:36,358
phosphorus in all seasons really at

1016
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:38,639
Kingo and now just recently they're

1017
00:34:36,358 --> 00:34:41,440
starting to see an upward Trend in

1018
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:43,679
phosphorus uh release uh from from the

1019
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:45,559
dam to Downstream so it's starting to

1020
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:48,398
become a source of phosphorus in part

1021
00:34:45,559 --> 00:34:49,838
due to scour perhaps due to um dissolve

1022
00:34:48,398 --> 00:34:52,078
PE is still actually going down so it's

1023
00:34:49,838 --> 00:34:53,719
really a particulate P phenomenon that's

1024
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:55,000
that's going on behind the dam but kind

1025
00:34:53,719 --> 00:34:58,439
of an interesting story and there's a

1026
00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:00,000
lot of discussion um Indianapolis and

1027
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:01,838
elsewhere about what to do about the con

1028
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,880
Wingo they had just released a report

1029
00:35:01,838 --> 00:35:05,719
last fall on whether they should dredge

1030
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:07,838
it or not dredge it I think this the

1031
00:35:05,719 --> 00:35:09,959
recommendation was to not dredge it um

1032
00:35:07,838 --> 00:35:11,799
and to leave it alone but it is you know

1033
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:13,838
look going forward something to probably

1034
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:16,200
consider in terms of foster management

1035
00:35:13,838 --> 00:35:18,519
and the challenges it

1036
00:35:16,199 --> 00:35:20,639
represents so I'll probably I'll close

1037
00:35:18,519 --> 00:35:22,519
here with just some emerging concerns uh

1038
00:35:20,639 --> 00:35:24,039
and one that I thought is probably most

1039
00:35:22,519 --> 00:35:26,199
pressing from a nutrient management

1040
00:35:24,039 --> 00:35:28,559
standpoint uh is is kind of the role of

1041
00:35:26,199 --> 00:35:30,559
climate change on hydrological

1042
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:34,159
hydrological connectivity and phosphorus

1043
00:35:30,559 --> 00:35:36,639
loss um this is the f36 Watershed um one

1044
00:35:34,159 --> 00:35:39,039
of the subwatersheds where I where we

1045
00:35:36,639 --> 00:35:40,679
work and this just shows the

1046
00:35:39,039 --> 00:35:42,838
distribution of phosphorus

1047
00:35:40,679 --> 00:35:44,399
concentrations in soils um from less

1048
00:35:42,838 --> 00:35:47,838
than 50 all the way up to greater than

1049
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:49,480
400 parts per million and so typically

1050
00:35:47,838 --> 00:35:51,078
with the foser index what we've done or

1051
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:52,559
one approach has just been to try to get

1052
00:35:51,079 --> 00:35:54,240
at you know what's the contributing area

1053
00:35:52,559 --> 00:35:56,440
for different storms or different or

1054
00:35:54,239 --> 00:35:58,239
storms of different return periods and

1055
00:35:56,440 --> 00:36:00,480
so a real simple way is just to try to

1056
00:35:58,239 --> 00:36:02,598
come up with a linear distance a buffer

1057
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:05,000
from the stream and and say that's your

1058
00:36:02,599 --> 00:36:07,440
zone of risk and we've typically managed

1059
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:09,119
for these frequently occurring one year

1060
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:10,358
to twoyear kind of storms you those are

1061
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:12,960
the ones we're most concerned with they

1062
00:36:10,358 --> 00:36:15,358
come around most often and so if you did

1063
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:17,679
that just for this particular Watershed

1064
00:36:15,358 --> 00:36:19,400
you your oneyear storm you draw a buffer

1065
00:36:17,679 --> 00:36:20,719
you know around the system like this and

1066
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:22,358
you would say this is a Zone where we're

1067
00:36:20,719 --> 00:36:23,879
you know most actively going to protect

1068
00:36:22,358 --> 00:36:27,639
you know for phosphorus

1069
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:28,680
loss um but recently with these reports

1070
00:36:27,639 --> 00:36:30,559
that have come out you you know there's

1071
00:36:28,679 --> 00:36:32,159
been some really interesting uh findings

1072
00:36:30,559 --> 00:36:33,440
in terms of you know we've seen this

1073
00:36:32,159 --> 00:36:35,639
we've looked at our own data there's a

1074
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:36,960
there's a there been for example a 71%

1075
00:36:35,639 --> 00:36:39,719
increase in the occurrence of extreme

1076
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:42,119
rainfall events from 58 1958 to 2012 so

1077
00:36:39,719 --> 00:36:44,679
we're getting more extreme rains more uh

1078
00:36:42,119 --> 00:36:46,559
you know you know flooding um there's

1079
00:36:44,679 --> 00:36:48,519
been an increase in River flooding

1080
00:36:46,559 --> 00:36:50,440
that's in you know across the us but

1081
00:36:48,519 --> 00:36:54,880
most prominently you know we've seen

1082
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:56,760
upticks in the Northeast um and so in FD

1083
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:58,680
36 this is just looking at Tropical

1084
00:36:56,760 --> 00:37:00,680
Storm Lee as an example and perhaps it's

1085
00:36:58,679 --> 00:37:02,399
an extreme case but yeah I picked the

1086
00:37:00,679 --> 00:37:04,000
most extreme because it probably helped

1087
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:07,440
tell the story a little

1088
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:10,440
bit but the peak discharge uh NFD 36

1089
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:13,800
with 53 Cub fe uh feet per second uh for

1090
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:16,920
tropical storm Lee that equates to about

1091
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:18,079
a you know return period of 73 years um

1092
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:20,680
for that

1093
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:23,280
storm and so a storm that occurs you

1094
00:37:20,679 --> 00:37:25,399
know with that kind of frequency um you

1095
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:27,880
know this is you draw 100 meter buffer

1096
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:30,240
for a 5year storm you get maybe a 10e

1097
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:31,920
storm is 150 meter buffer and beyond

1098
00:37:30,239 --> 00:37:34,919
that you're you're kind

1099
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:36,639
of almost the entire Watershed is is at

1100
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:38,000
that point a critical Source area I mean

1101
00:37:36,639 --> 00:37:39,838
that's not to say the entire Watershed

1102
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,838
is generating runoff but you know one

1103
00:37:39,838 --> 00:37:44,440
would presume that any one any of these

1104
00:37:41,838 --> 00:37:46,759
areas could conceivably contributing

1105
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:49,119
phosphorus and so if these storms are

1106
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:51,079
going to become more frequent uh at all

1107
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:52,720
if there's if there's any tendency for

1108
00:37:51,079 --> 00:37:54,400
these storms become more common then I

1109
00:37:52,719 --> 00:37:56,199
think you know in terms of nutrient

1110
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:58,480
management one concern is just you know

1111
00:37:56,199 --> 00:37:59,639
how can we manage how do we manage for

1112
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:02,159
these kinds of events they're also the

1113
00:37:59,639 --> 00:38:03,519
ones that move the most p and um you

1114
00:38:02,159 --> 00:38:06,960
know if you look at phosphorous loss

1115
00:38:03,519 --> 00:38:08,880
just um in w38 you know Harry pan was

1116
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:10,720
famous for saying that you know it's one

1117
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:12,559
or two storms in a year that you know

1118
00:38:10,719 --> 00:38:14,239
produce the majority of your phosphorus

1119
00:38:12,559 --> 00:38:16,440
loss so it's if it's storms like this

1120
00:38:14,239 --> 00:38:18,199
then you know how do you know how do we

1121
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:21,559
how do we manage you know for these

1122
00:38:18,199 --> 00:38:22,799
kinds of events and so with that um Can

1123
00:38:21,559 --> 00:38:24,239
about 10 minutes left so it's probably

1124
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:26,800
good that I'm

1125
00:38:24,239 --> 00:38:28,559
summarizing uh basically in summary you

1126
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:30,318
know that for these sloped areas it's

1127
00:38:28,559 --> 00:38:32,838
the hydrologically active areas that

1128
00:38:30,318 --> 00:38:34,480
drive phospherous transport you know and

1129
00:38:32,838 --> 00:38:36,159
and and those are the areas that we most

1130
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:38,159
are interested in managing and

1131
00:38:36,159 --> 00:38:39,559
protecting you know in the lowlands

1132
00:38:38,159 --> 00:38:41,679
where our our primary concern is

1133
00:38:39,559 --> 00:38:43,719
artificial drainage um and the role of

1134
00:38:41,679 --> 00:38:45,399
drainage in connecting phosphorous

1135
00:38:43,719 --> 00:38:47,679
sources to receiving Waters and and ways

1136
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:50,400
to manage and mitigate you know uh you

1137
00:38:47,679 --> 00:38:51,679
know the the phosphorus moving from the

1138
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:54,519
landscape to the

1139
00:38:51,679 --> 00:38:56,239
stream phospherous transports in rivers

1140
00:38:54,519 --> 00:38:58,239
is largely event driven and a large of

1141
00:38:56,239 --> 00:39:00,358
that the majority of that occurring in

1142
00:38:58,239 --> 00:39:02,479
storms and you know changes in the

1143
00:39:00,358 --> 00:39:03,880
frequency of extreme events um I would

1144
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:05,159
