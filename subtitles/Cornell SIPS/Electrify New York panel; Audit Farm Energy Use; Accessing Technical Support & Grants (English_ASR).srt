1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:04,759
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:12,759
University I appreciate everyone uh my

3
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:16,600
name is Gabriel Gurley I'm the program

4
00:00:12,759 --> 00:00:20,518
manager for a energy New York program um

5
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:22,320
we Statewide program working with uh

6
00:00:20,518 --> 00:00:26,159
Cooperative Extension offices throughout

7
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:29,079
the state um but our offices uh are

8
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:31,160
located in the tokin county Cooperative

9
00:00:29,079 --> 00:00:32,519
Extension Office

10
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:36,119
so I'm going to spend a few minutes

11
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:38,559
talking to you today about uh audit uh

12
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:42,238
Farm energy use um talk about a little

13
00:00:38,558 --> 00:00:45,479
bit about the uh auditing process uh

14
00:00:42,238 --> 00:00:46,479
energy auditing process for farms uh so

15
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:48,679
I'll give you a little bit of

16
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:52,640
description about that and uh also talk

17
00:00:48,679 --> 00:00:52,640
about the technical supports and

18
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:59,160
grants so I'm going to first begin

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,399
talking a little bit about our the

20
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:06,039
energy auditing process What It Is What

21
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:09,000
It entails what kind of benefits um

22
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:11,400
someone can receive from an energy

23
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,759
audit um afterwards I'm going to spend a

24
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:16,759
little bit of uh time talking about

25
00:01:13,759 --> 00:01:19,799
different energy grants financing

26
00:01:16,759 --> 00:01:21,799
programs there's a wide away of programs

27
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:24,000
there's no way for me to cover it all in

28
00:01:21,799 --> 00:01:27,479
this presentation today but I'm going to

29
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,239
hit the major ones and all the ones uh

30
00:01:27,478 --> 00:01:31,879
that I'm going to present today is

31
00:01:29,239 --> 00:01:34,078
related to agricultural production I'll

32
00:01:31,879 --> 00:01:37,399
probably touch a little bit about

33
00:01:34,078 --> 00:01:39,599
residential um but again mostly uh

34
00:01:37,399 --> 00:01:42,599
because of the program I work in I'm

35
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:44,798
going to spend my time and focus on

36
00:01:42,599 --> 00:01:48,118
those that particularly address

37
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:51,320
agricultural production and then finally

38
00:01:48,118 --> 00:01:54,319
I'm going to kind of tie it all in and

39
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:57,199
um kind of point out some things that at

40
00:01:54,319 --> 00:02:00,919
a energy New York we can assist with in

41
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,920
this in these endeavors

42
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:06,439
so first off what is an energy audit and

43
00:02:05,039 --> 00:02:09,199
what are their

44
00:02:06,438 --> 00:02:12,120
benefits an energy audit sometimes it's

45
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:13,959
also referred to as an energy assessment

46
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:17,120
it's basically just a detailed

47
00:02:13,959 --> 00:02:19,519
examination of a building's energy use

48
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:23,319
um in the case of agricultural

49
00:02:19,519 --> 00:02:26,239
production um it can entail the entire

50
00:02:23,318 --> 00:02:30,399
agricultural production process on the

51
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:32,439
farm so buildings for example it may be

52
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:35,319
a poultry building or some sort of

53
00:02:32,439 --> 00:02:39,639
livestock building a barn that uh the

54
00:02:35,318 --> 00:02:42,119
energy audit process will go through and

55
00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:45,359
evaluate but it could be other things

56
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:49,200
specifically on the farm um P specific

57
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:50,840
pieces of equipment for example um if

58
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:55,479
you're in value added production for

59
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:59,439
example it could itail Refrigeration

60
00:02:55,479 --> 00:03:01,318
cooling uh ventilation for f stock

61
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:04,719
pretty much it covers everything across

62
00:03:01,318 --> 00:03:07,479
the board so um I talk about buildings

63
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:09,919
often times folks think about an energy

64
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:13,598
assessment referring to the residential

65
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:15,439
home which those are available as well

66
00:03:13,598 --> 00:03:19,280
um but when it comes to agricultural

67
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:23,519
production it covers the entire

68
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:26,919
agricultural production that's on the

69
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:30,438
farm and the purpose of an energy audit

70
00:03:26,919 --> 00:03:33,318
is to uh identify energy saving

71
00:03:30,438 --> 00:03:35,680
opportunities and improving performance

72
00:03:33,318 --> 00:03:37,798
and that's both within the buildings and

73
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:40,439
for the agricultural production

74
00:03:37,799 --> 00:03:40,438
operations

75
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:48,640
overall what's included in an energy

76
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:51,360
audit an energy audit or assessment of

77
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:54,279
how a building or a tire production uh

78
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:57,640
operation uses energy where it is being

79
00:03:54,280 --> 00:04:01,438
wasted and any safety or health

80
00:03:57,639 --> 00:04:04,919
issues um often times when you get the

81
00:04:01,438 --> 00:04:08,359
report it's a very detailed report it

82
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:11,759
breaks everything down uh on the

83
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:13,920
operation um factoring in uh where the

84
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:16,439
energyy is being used where it's being

85
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:19,680
wasted safety or health

86
00:04:16,439 --> 00:04:22,680
issues um often times in that energy

87
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:25,240
audit it'll also have what they have an

88
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:27,879
called an executive summary page it kind

89
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:32,240
of gives you the highlights of what the

90
00:04:27,879 --> 00:04:34,759
entire report is um but it's looks like

91
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,639
an engine an engineering report it's

92
00:04:34,759 --> 00:04:39,160
very

93
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:42,759
detailed um the report can be multiple

94
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:46,280
dozen pages long um so it really does

95
00:04:42,759 --> 00:04:49,479
cover everything from a to z uh in terms

96
00:04:46,279 --> 00:04:53,959
of the farm operation or in the case of

97
00:04:49,478 --> 00:04:53,959
residential uh the homeowner as

98
00:04:54,439 --> 00:05:00,560
well so those list of recommendations uh

99
00:04:57,879 --> 00:05:03,600
recommended Energy Efficiency measur me

100
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:06,519
and Associated Energy savings po uh

101
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:10,879
potentials are listed in that

102
00:05:06,519 --> 00:05:13,439
report um it'll break down equipment by

103
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:16,159
equipment uh when an energy auditor

104
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:18,360
comes out and performs an energy auditor

105
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,960
assessment on the farm they will

106
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:22,280
actually go through every piece of

107
00:05:19,959 --> 00:05:25,159
equipment they'll pull the information

108
00:05:22,279 --> 00:05:27,439
off the name plates off the equipment

109
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:30,240
they detail that they put it in the

110
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:32,120
report um and they have the ability to

111
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:35,319
measure and calculate based upon the

112
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:40,000
piece of equipment what potential energy

113
00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:44,319
uses it's uh consuming on the farm and

114
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:46,839
also if there could be based upon uh the

115
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:49,360
production measures that the uh Farm is

116
00:05:46,839 --> 00:05:52,560
using uh they could give recommendations

117
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:54,000
on where some Associated Energy savings

118
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,839
can

119
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,680
be one of the things about the energy

120
00:05:56,839 --> 00:06:02,399
audit or energy assessment as well

121
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:05,120
particularly with Farm production is

122
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:08,478
that they don't give recommendations

123
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:11,199
just to say oh well you know you can go

124
00:06:08,478 --> 00:06:14,038
Net Zero by doing this this and this

125
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:16,280
when the energy auditor uh comes out on

126
00:06:14,038 --> 00:06:20,959
to the farm they have a conversation

127
00:06:16,279 --> 00:06:23,239
with the farmer themselves and they will

128
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:25,959
listen to the farmer and try to figure

129
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:27,759
out what their goals and objectives are

130
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:30,198
and when they recommend make a

131
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:33,080
recommendation on the report

132
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:34,960
they try to make sure that that those

133
00:06:33,079 --> 00:06:36,839
recommendations is something that the

134
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:40,120
farmer can actually

135
00:06:36,839 --> 00:06:42,519
Implement um something that is within

136
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:44,639
the goals of what the farm is trying to

137
00:06:42,519 --> 00:06:46,240
achieve and they certainly don't make

138
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:50,240
recommendations that's going to make the

139
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:51,639
farm the farmers's life harder so if

140
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:54,160
they don't come out and make

141
00:06:51,639 --> 00:06:57,038
recommendations just to say well you do

142
00:06:54,160 --> 00:07:00,160
this you can reduce the amount of energy

143
00:06:57,038 --> 00:07:02,639
used by such and such if they know that

144
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:04,680
it's going to create more issues in the

145
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:06,680
production process for the

146
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:08,000
farmers then they're probably not going

147
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:10,598
to follow through with the

148
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:14,399
recommendations so they really try to

149
00:07:10,598 --> 00:07:18,478
take a realistic approach when uh the

150
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:21,279
energy audits are uh performed and what

151
00:07:18,478 --> 00:07:24,399
they put in the report in terms of those

152
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:24,399
energy saving

153
00:07:25,959 --> 00:07:30,079
measures when is an energy audit useful

154
00:07:29,319 --> 00:07:32,160
um

155
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:34,719
I've got two items here but there's

156
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:37,759
multiple reasons why energy audit is

157
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:40,440
useful uh for first before making any

158
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:42,879
energy saving improvements or adding a

159
00:07:40,439 --> 00:07:44,240
renewable energy system it's important

160
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:47,240
to have

161
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:49,400
one also having a plan for equipment

162
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:52,519
Replacements that increase Energy

163
00:07:49,399 --> 00:07:55,799
Efficiency when a component fails so one

164
00:07:52,519 --> 00:08:00,038
of the benefits about an energy

165
00:07:55,800 --> 00:08:02,240
assessment is often times it's usually

166
00:08:00,038 --> 00:08:05,360
uh somebody requests one because they

167
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:08,000
want to see what they can do to save

168
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:11,439
energy of course that's what the energy

169
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,839
assessment report will produce but let's

170
00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:16,158
say it's something on a major piece of

171
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:17,478
equipment the equipment hasn't failed

172
00:08:16,158 --> 00:08:20,038
yet it was going to be a major

173
00:08:17,478 --> 00:08:23,360
investment for the farmer so maybe the

174
00:08:20,038 --> 00:08:25,759
farmer says I can't do it right now but

175
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:27,960
it's something I should look into well

176
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:31,280
any piece of equipment sooner or later

177
00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:33,439
is going to fail so guess what if the

178
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:35,799
farmer has had an energy assessment or

179
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:38,200
AIT performed when that piece of

180
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:41,158
equipment fails the first thing they can

181
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:43,479
do is go grab that report and say yes I

182
00:08:41,158 --> 00:08:45,480
can remember that the energy auditor

183
00:08:43,479 --> 00:08:47,639
told me something about replacing this

184
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:50,839
with another piece of equipment they've

185
00:08:47,639 --> 00:08:54,759
got a road map to to go by so they're

186
00:08:50,839 --> 00:08:56,600
not just going out and making impulse

187
00:08:54,759 --> 00:08:58,278
decisions they can go by that

188
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:59,720
recommendation replace it with a newer

189
00:08:58,278 --> 00:09:02,919
piece of equipment it's more energ energ

190
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:06,079
efficient so it's really like having a

191
00:09:02,919 --> 00:09:09,599
road map or a plan in place in case

192
00:09:06,078 --> 00:09:11,359
something were to change or disent piece

193
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:15,240
of equipment were to

194
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:18,480
fail um sometimes an energy audit is

195
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:21,759
required um if a farmer for example is

196
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:23,839
either purchasing a new Farm or looking

197
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:26,838
at making some production

198
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:30,519
changes sometimes the lender may require

199
00:09:26,839 --> 00:09:33,160
an energy assessment to be performed

200
00:09:30,519 --> 00:09:36,000
so sometimes the farmer will call out

201
00:09:33,159 --> 00:09:39,120
and request an energy assessment for

202
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,120
those purposes as

203
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:46,078
well energy a audits can help you

204
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:49,000
understand how much energy your

205
00:09:46,078 --> 00:09:52,879
residence or agricultural op operation

206
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,839
uses it PRI prioritizes problem areas

207
00:09:52,879 --> 00:09:56,639
and

208
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:58,399
fixes helps make your residents or

209
00:09:56,639 --> 00:10:00,639
agricultural production areas more

210
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:03,879
efficient and comfortable able for the

211
00:10:00,639 --> 00:10:06,278
workers livestock and you so it's not

212
00:10:03,879 --> 00:10:08,679
just necessarily about trying to save

213
00:10:06,278 --> 00:10:11,078
the energy you know that's one of the

214
00:10:08,679 --> 00:10:13,039
goals but also it can help make the

215
00:10:11,078 --> 00:10:15,799
operation more efficient and more

216
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:19,599
comfortable for everyone that's on the

217
00:10:15,799 --> 00:10:22,120
farm uh learn how to uh you use your

218
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:23,839
energy sometimes that energy audit

219
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:26,320
sometimes folks don't even realize that

220
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:29,040
some pieces of equipment is consuming

221
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:31,278
that much of electricity so you learn a

222
00:10:29,039 --> 00:10:34,719
lot of about the equipment and what may

223
00:10:31,278 --> 00:10:37,559
be using energy on the farm to determine

224
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:39,240
where the energy is being wasted to make

225
00:10:37,559 --> 00:10:41,879
personalized

226
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:44,278
recommendations and to help lower your

227
00:10:41,879 --> 00:10:44,278
energy

228
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:51,639
bills so how do you apply for an energy

229
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:55,079
audit here in New York it's extremely

230
00:10:51,639 --> 00:10:56,959
simple to get an energy audit performed

231
00:10:55,078 --> 00:10:59,559
the energy audits are available at no

232
00:10:56,958 --> 00:11:02,518
charge to customers of an invest your

233
00:10:59,559 --> 00:11:06,719
own utility and what that means is uh

234
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:09,078
nice egg National Grid any of your major

235
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:11,519
utility companies they're considered to

236
00:11:09,078 --> 00:11:15,399
be investor own utilities and the

237
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:18,560
easiest way to determine that is when uh

238
00:11:15,399 --> 00:11:20,000
farmer can opens up their utility bill

239
00:11:18,559 --> 00:11:22,679
if they look on their bill and they see

240
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,799
a systems benefit charge posted there on

241
00:11:22,679 --> 00:11:30,599
their the utility bill that indicates

242
00:11:25,799 --> 00:11:33,159
they're eligible for the energy audit

243
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:34,519
anyone who looking is looking for uh an

244
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:37,278
energy audit for

245
00:11:34,519 --> 00:11:40,159
residents best way to do is reach out to

246
00:11:37,278 --> 00:11:43,278
your Regional clean energy Hub you can

247
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:45,799
also contact participating local service

248
00:11:43,278 --> 00:11:48,360
providers uh for those energy audits as

249
00:11:45,799 --> 00:11:51,039
well a lot of HVAC companies and those

250
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:55,000
sorts of folks uh can come out and

251
00:11:51,039 --> 00:11:58,199
provide an energy assessment as well for

252
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,799
agricultural operations it's very simple

253
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:02,839
as well

254
00:11:59,799 --> 00:12:06,519
uh you go through nera's energy audit

255
00:12:02,839 --> 00:12:08,760
program um if you don't you go to nera's

256
00:12:06,519 --> 00:12:12,039
website look up their agricultural

257
00:12:08,759 --> 00:12:14,078
program page there's a link posted there

258
00:12:12,039 --> 00:12:16,319
um if you can't find it there then of

259
00:12:14,078 --> 00:12:18,719
course go to the a energy New York

260
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:21,320
website uh we have the links posted

261
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:24,360
there we also have a contact us button

262
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:27,560
at the top where you can click and post

263
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:30,480
a message to myself and uh G in the

264
00:12:27,559 --> 00:12:34,759
office and we can get you relay to the

265
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:37,800
appropriate person um for an energy

266
00:12:34,759 --> 00:12:41,319
audit but the application itself there's

267
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:43,399
an online application that can fill out

268
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:45,959
and John you've helped walk through some

269
00:12:43,399 --> 00:12:48,078
folks as well when they call into the

270
00:12:45,958 --> 00:12:50,599
office uh through that process but

271
00:12:48,078 --> 00:12:52,319
there's an online application folks who

272
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:55,000
are maybe a little intimidated on

273
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:58,320
filling out applications online that's

274
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:02,159
where John and has helped folks out

275
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:04,440
before through energy New York uh the

276
00:13:02,159 --> 00:13:07,198
paper application it's literally one

277
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:09,040
page front and back basically all they

278
00:13:07,198 --> 00:13:12,639
have to do is fill out their name a

279
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:15,759
telephone number email address what type

280
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:19,198
of Commodities they produce on the farm

281
00:13:15,759 --> 00:13:22,039
and sign on the back um it's just about

282
00:13:19,198 --> 00:13:26,198
as simple as anything that you can apply

283
00:13:22,039 --> 00:13:29,159
for um again these audits are per uh

284
00:13:26,198 --> 00:13:30,958
available at no charge to the customers

285
00:13:29,159 --> 00:13:34,879
and these audits are also available

286
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:37,359
every two to three years so uh once you

287
00:13:34,879 --> 00:13:38,879
get an energy audit performed it's not

288
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:41,800
one of those things where you just get

289
00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:44,278
report you set it aside if your

290
00:13:41,799 --> 00:13:47,639
production changes on the farm maybe

291
00:13:44,278 --> 00:13:50,039
you're entering into some new crops or

292
00:13:47,639 --> 00:13:51,720
uh maybe growing some different types of

293
00:13:50,039 --> 00:13:53,879
or raising some different types of

294
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:56,759
livestock maybe you're getting into a

295
00:13:53,879 --> 00:13:59,639
value added production on your farm at

296
00:13:56,759 --> 00:14:02,240
any time there's changes happen to your

297
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:05,799
farm you can request to have another

298
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,799
free energy audit

299
00:14:06,039 --> 00:14:12,078
performed okay so that covers a little

300
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:14,519
bit about the energy audit

301
00:14:12,078 --> 00:14:17,319
process I'm going to touch a little bit

302
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:19,679
here on the various grants and financial

303
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:21,879
programs that are

304
00:14:19,679 --> 00:14:25,838
available um so I'm going to cover in

305
00:14:21,879 --> 00:14:28,159
three major areas the USDA re program uh

306
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:29,639
utility specific programs and I'm

307
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:33,078
highlighting National

308
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:35,879
grid uh just as an example because they

309
00:14:33,078 --> 00:14:39,039
cover such a large area of the state but

310
00:14:35,879 --> 00:14:43,278
the other utilities throughout the state

311
00:14:39,039 --> 00:14:45,559
um offer various programs as well so

312
00:14:43,278 --> 00:14:47,958
just because you're in NYSEG or rg&amp;

313
00:14:45,559 --> 00:14:50,439
service area they have programs

314
00:14:47,958 --> 00:14:53,479
available uh for agricultural producers

315
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:57,079
as well and then I'll touch on a few

316
00:14:53,480 --> 00:15:00,000
other uh resources as well nrcs

317
00:14:57,078 --> 00:15:03,559
programs uh USDA

318
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:05,799
and the nerta re technical assistance

319
00:15:03,559 --> 00:15:08,319
program one of the things that you don't

320
00:15:05,799 --> 00:15:11,159
see on here is that there's State

321
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:13,079
programs that New York state offers at

322
00:15:11,159 --> 00:15:16,319
the state level as

323
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:18,958
well um so for the sake of time we

324
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:21,320
couldn't go into all those but they have

325
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:23,919
specific programs that may tie in to

326
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:26,440
some of these programs as well and one

327
00:15:23,919 --> 00:15:29,000
of the questions that's always asked is

328
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:31,639
well can I apply for a reap Grant and

329
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:34,759
apply for a state grant program or

330
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:38,079
financing the answer is in many cases

331
00:15:34,759 --> 00:15:40,800
yes you can stack incentives and grants

332
00:15:38,078 --> 00:15:43,559
on top of one another to help reduce

333
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:46,958
those costs the barriers cost to

334
00:15:43,559 --> 00:15:46,958
adopting energy

335
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:54,480
efficiencies so first up is the reap

336
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:56,600
program uh the re program or uh it's an

337
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:59,360
acronym for Rural energy for America

338
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:03,680
program it was first created back in

339
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:06,440
2008 in by Congress a new uh farm bill

340
00:16:03,679 --> 00:16:09,559
and reap helps uh support Farmers

341
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:12,600
ranchers and Rural communities adopt en

342
00:16:09,559 --> 00:16:16,278
Energy Efficiency measures and also

343
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:16,278
utilize renewable energy

344
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:21,959
sources so the

345
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:23,879
objectives for reap uh re facilitates

346
00:16:21,958 --> 00:16:26,919
its Mission through two primary

347
00:16:23,879 --> 00:16:29,559
objectives one it's a grant or loan

348
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:31,479
guarantee to agricultural producers

349
00:16:29,559 --> 00:16:34,198
and Rural businesses for Energy

350
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:37,560
Efficiency improvements and the purchase

351
00:16:34,198 --> 00:16:40,198
of renewable energy systems it also

352
00:16:37,559 --> 00:16:43,000
provides grants to service providers to

353
00:16:40,198 --> 00:16:45,120
assist farmers in getting energy Audits

354
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,958
and planning and development of

355
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:52,879
utilizing renewable energy

356
00:16:47,958 --> 00:16:54,599
sources to qualify for reap Grant um

357
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:57,679
agricultural producers must receive at

358
00:16:54,600 --> 00:17:00,839
least 50% of their gross income from

359
00:16:57,679 --> 00:17:00,838
their agricultural office

360
00:17:02,559 --> 00:17:08,119
operations uh reap qualified Energy

361
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:11,439
Efficiency improvements it covers a wide

362
00:17:08,119 --> 00:17:14,399
range of areas uh that re funding can be

363
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:18,400
used for I just put a few bullet points

364
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:21,199
on here um but most of the things that

365
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:23,798
you could typically think of um in terms

366
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:26,640
of energy and uh efficiency improvements

367
00:17:23,798 --> 00:17:29,679
it will cover so high efficiency heating

368
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:32,320
ventilation air conditioning systems

369
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:35,080
insulation lighting Cooling and

370
00:17:32,319 --> 00:17:37,639
Refrigeration units energy efficient

371
00:17:35,079 --> 00:17:37,639
