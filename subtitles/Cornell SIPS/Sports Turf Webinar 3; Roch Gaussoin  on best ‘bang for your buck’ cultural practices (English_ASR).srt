1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,520
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:06,960
University keeping what this year's is

3
00:00:05,519 --> 00:00:10,289
the third week of our sports turf

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:11,490
webinar as always we'll start with dr.

5
00:00:10,289 --> 00:00:13,678
Rossi he'll give us a little bit of an

6
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:16,289
overview what the current situation is

7
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:18,210
growing season wise you know we might

8
00:00:16,289 --> 00:00:20,010
get some perspective on the COBIT

9
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:21,778
situation short restrictions minimum

10
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:23,609
maintenance things like that and then

11
00:00:21,778 --> 00:00:25,820
we're joined by dr. raucous why out of

12
00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:28,519
the universe University of Nebraska

13
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:30,629
probably one of the most published and

14
00:00:28,518 --> 00:00:32,609
accomplished researcher you're going to

15
00:00:30,629 --> 00:00:35,488

great conversation we'll have some great

17
00:00:35,488 --> 00:00:40,378
discussions on cultivation and certainly

18
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:43,319

34
00:01:22,379 --> 00:01:26,879
Brian winkin did a wonderful job and a

35
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:28,739
recent tweet I'm a big fan of Brian's

36
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:31,408
we've done a podcast together talking

37
00:01:28,739 --> 00:01:33,328
about hit that initial concept him in

38
00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:35,850
munch aw were working on called blue

39
00:01:33,328 --> 00:01:37,649
muta posted something on his Twitter

40
00:01:35,849 --> 00:01:39,118
account that really says it all and I

41
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:41,759
have to say in the northeastern United

42
00:01:39,118 --> 00:01:44,790
States this is exactly what it's been

43
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:47,579
like for the last several years never

44
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:49,920
mind just April and then to only maybe

45
00:01:47,578 --> 00:01:51,509
get a good stretch of weather and to

46
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,450
have to feel close for the current

47
00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:56,519
situation so will I will try to distract

48
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:58,680
you for the next thirty minutes we'll be

49
00:01:56,519 --> 00:02:00,269
pretty close to trying to get this done

50
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:02,729
so you can get onto the other things

51
00:02:00,269 --> 00:02:04,618
that are important in the day so just a

52
00:02:02,728 --> 00:02:06,750
message from your land-grant institution

53
00:02:04,618 --> 00:02:08,429
here in New York and I know my colleague

54
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:10,169
at the land-grant institution and in

55
00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:12,390
great state of Nebraska has the same

56
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:14,009
mindset that right now we need to

57
00:02:12,389 --> 00:02:16,018
support each other and the best

58
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:18,090
universities and learning centers can do

59
00:02:16,019 --> 00:02:20,219
is to try to collaborate with each other

60
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:21,989
because solutions will come about and

61
00:02:20,219 --> 00:02:24,299
and Rock knows me well enough to know I

62
00:02:21,989 --> 00:02:26,938
I think I know a lot but I know enough

63
00:02:24,299 --> 00:02:28,349
to know I I know barely anything and

64
00:02:26,938 --> 00:02:30,658
that's why it's great to have the

65
00:02:28,348 --> 00:02:32,340
collaborators join us and we've had a

66
00:02:30,658 --> 00:02:33,959
long list of really good scientists

67
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:36,180
thanks again to Rock for joining us so

68
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:38,819
we have our weekly newsletter in

69
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:41,129
addition to us yakking here on on the

70
00:02:38,818 --> 00:02:42,958
computer we've been writing this up now

71
00:02:41,128 --> 00:02:45,810
I've been journaling the growing seasons

72
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:48,060
for the last 21 years and if you'd like

73
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:51,390
to get a copy of this we're covering

74
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:53,069
topics more in depth in writing and then

75
00:02:51,389 --> 00:02:55,949
echoing it in the webinar so you're

76
00:02:53,068 --> 00:02:57,568
getting a double dose of our mind set in

77
00:02:55,949 --> 00:03:00,689
a way we're thinking about approaching

78
00:02:57,568 --> 00:03:03,089
it here at Cornell well I have to say

79
00:03:00,689 --> 00:03:05,098
Pam Sherrod in the sports turf program

80
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:08,189
at Ohio State to me in many ways is the

81
00:03:05,098 --> 00:03:12,060
gold standard of a program that you know

82
00:03:08,189 --> 00:03:13,949
comprehensively addresses sports field

83
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:16,979
management I put goalies program

84
00:03:13,949 --> 00:03:18,719
certainly in Iowa State's program and

85
00:03:16,979 --> 00:03:20,518
you know Rock knows these programs very

86
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:22,650
well over the years and Pam did a

87
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:25,530
wonderful job of putting together this

88
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:28,889
ten maintenance practices to focus on

89
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:31,199
during this particular issue and and I

90
00:03:28,889 --> 00:03:33,540
think the first thing is she mentions

91
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:36,840
and I commend this to you Carla put the

92
00:03:33,539 --> 00:03:38,698
link up to these bodies to these

93
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:40,319
resources that we cite during the

94
00:03:38,699 --> 00:03:42,660
webinar and the things that Rock and I

95
00:03:40,318 --> 00:03:43,979
talked about but first and foremost you

96
00:03:42,659 --> 00:03:45,359
know in many ways Golf Course

97
00:03:43,979 --> 00:03:48,388
superintendent's are having to deal with

98
00:03:45,359 --> 00:03:49,980
this grounds managers are having to deal

99
00:03:48,389 --> 00:03:51,090
with it then sports field managers

100
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:53,250
having to deal with it

101
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:55,650
restricting the use of your turf grass

102
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:57,870
areas you can't use it we keep it for

103
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:59,699
you to use but right now for whatever

104
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:02,400
reason you can't use it for you the

105
00:03:59,699 --> 00:04:04,799
activity is restricted the liability

106
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,150
insurance we're not going to maintain it

107
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:08,939
you name it

108
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:11,519
in my mind a lot of the work of sports

109
00:04:08,939 --> 00:04:14,370
field managers Falls first and foremost

110
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:16,680
on managing your facility keeping people

111
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:19,439
safe your workforce safe and of course

112
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:21,120
the users of the facility safe now

113
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:23,389
what's really interesting in New York

114
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:26,668
State we have you know thinking about

115
00:04:23,389 --> 00:04:27,870
universities and school districts we

116
00:04:26,668 --> 00:04:29,668
have the New York state school

117
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:32,459
facilities management Institute that

118
00:04:29,668 --> 00:04:33,930
recently did a survey for those of you

119
00:04:32,459 --> 00:04:35,509
that are joining from school districts

120
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:38,129
wondering that sports fields or

121
00:04:35,509 --> 00:04:40,500
municipalities or larger facilities run

122
00:04:38,129 --> 00:04:42,418
by the state they did a survey which

123
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:44,908
says which statement best describes your

124
00:04:42,418 --> 00:04:46,709
current operations and it they got 80

125
00:04:44,908 --> 00:04:49,949
responses which I thought was actually

126
00:04:46,709 --> 00:04:52,288
pretty good probably 10% 15% of the of

127
00:04:49,949 --> 00:04:54,870
the staff the school district staff

128
00:04:52,288 --> 00:04:56,579
anyway so there's some the majority of

129
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:58,860
them have limited maintenance and

130
00:04:56,579 --> 00:05:02,609
performing just building checks and just

131
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:04,439
emergency stuff a few of them have no

132
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:06,360
maintenance staff on-site and I don't

133
00:05:04,439 --> 00:05:09,180
really know how much of this relates to

134
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:11,610
sports fields but it's some data locally

135
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:13,348
on on removing some of the confusion

136
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:14,819
about what other facilities are doing

137
00:05:13,348 --> 00:05:17,728
with regard to their sports fields

138
00:05:14,819 --> 00:05:19,579
surely the majority of activities that a

139
00:05:17,728 --> 00:05:22,709
lot of our fields would be used for

140
00:05:19,579 --> 00:05:25,408
intentionally is not happening a lot of

141
00:05:22,709 --> 00:05:27,180
those things are not allowed now every

142
00:05:25,408 --> 00:05:29,129
place I look I see that people are

143
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:31,650
having to break up these sorts of things

144
00:05:29,129 --> 00:05:33,899
so they are happening to some degree so

145
00:05:31,649 --> 00:05:36,089
again it adds to the confusion about how

146
00:05:33,899 --> 00:05:38,879
you approach managing your fields at

147
00:05:36,089 --> 00:05:40,709
this time well here at Cornell we got a

148
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:44,819
hard decision everybody's gone

149
00:05:40,709 --> 00:05:49,399
everybody's gone every we're good okay

150
00:05:44,819 --> 00:05:52,168
all right every we got a hard situation

151
00:05:49,399 --> 00:05:54,179
well a hard line we know exactly what's

152
00:05:52,168 --> 00:05:56,788
happening the kids are gone there's no

153
00:05:54,180 --> 00:06:00,028
sports and no one's going to be using

154
00:05:56,788 --> 00:06:02,218
this place until mid-july so are our

155
00:06:00,028 --> 00:06:04,379
athletic our sports turf manager Josh

156
00:06:02,218 --> 00:06:06,810
Fontaine put together a minimum action

157
00:06:04,379 --> 00:06:08,399
plan for kovat and we're sending it to

158
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:10,769
the athletic department we're making

159
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:14,759
everybody aware of the kinds of things

160
00:06:10,769 --> 00:06:16,918
that we're doing including including the

161
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:18,658
impact on labor hours right this is

162
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:20,069
something that everyone is having to

163
00:06:18,658 --> 00:06:23,218
deal with now we're really fortunate

164
00:06:20,069 --> 00:06:25,050
because between Carl and Josh we've been

165
00:06:23,218 --> 00:06:27,750
in Chris Citgo our other sports field

166
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:29,129
management expert we've developed sort

167
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:31,408
of how long does it take to do things

168
00:06:29,129 --> 00:06:34,379
for the way our fields are set up and

169
00:06:31,408 --> 00:06:36,569
the way we manage these things and so we

170
00:06:34,379 --> 00:06:38,399
know on our acreages are natural grass

171
00:06:36,569 --> 00:06:40,259
acreages that we're caring for the labor

172
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:42,509
so I'd encourage you opera

173
00:06:40,259 --> 00:06:44,789
racially to start thinking about these

174
00:06:42,509 --> 00:06:47,550
sorts of things depending on how long

175
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:49,680
this goes the pressure we get to rehire

176
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:51,620
people to return to normal or the

177
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:54,120
pressure we get to stay closed

178
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:56,970
communicating the impact on what's

179
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:58,379
possible and what you can do you know it

180
00:06:56,970 --> 00:07:00,150
doesn't Rock and I are gonna talk about

181
00:06:58,379 --> 00:07:01,920
soil management in a minute you're not

182
00:07:00,149 --> 00:07:05,729
doing any soil management if there's one

183
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:09,420
guy on 15 acres ok so first what do you

184
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:12,150
need to do certain things and again Pam

185
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:14,280
and the folks at the V I'm sorry the

186
00:07:12,149 --> 00:07:17,009
Ohio State University I forgive me for

187
00:07:14,279 --> 00:07:18,839
not bringing that up to begin with you

188
00:07:17,009 --> 00:07:20,339
know talks about mowing what's needed

189
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:23,129
and you know they've got regional

190
00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:25,949
differences their fungicide applications

191
00:07:23,129 --> 00:07:28,019
only if disease is active we don't have

192
00:07:25,949 --> 00:07:30,990
anything active in the northeast we got

193
00:07:28,019 --> 00:07:32,639
barely any mowing going on north of a

194
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:34,740
certain line we'll look at in a second

195
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:36,569
and then finally don't be putting on

196
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:39,210
quick-release sources if you don't have

197
00:07:36,569 --> 00:07:41,399
traffic right you're trying to slow

198
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:44,250
growth to some degree now this is gonna

199
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:46,079
be dependent on how much passive traffic

200
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:48,149
you're getting a lot of people are as

201
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:49,889
busy as they've ever been because people

202
00:07:48,149 --> 00:07:52,349
are just walking around all over the

203
00:07:49,889 --> 00:07:54,539
place and you have to determine how much

204
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:57,000
access people have to your sports fields

205
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:59,250
so let's look at some weather among my

206
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,170
favorite things to do right so this is

207
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:03,689
what it was last week when we met and

208
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:06,330
you can see that the 50 degree mark was

209
00:08:03,689 --> 00:08:08,399
barely into South Jersey and now it

210
00:08:06,329 --> 00:08:11,250
looks like we're in the mid to low 50s

211
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:14,069
into the Hudson Valley onto Long Island

212
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:16,829
it's just getting started this is a good

213
00:08:14,069 --> 00:08:19,529
barometer Dan to keep your eye on at our

214
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:21,959
forecast website for the Northeast about

215
00:08:19,529 --> 00:08:24,000
where the soil temperatures are now this

216
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:26,250
was last week what was pretty what was

217
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,589
expected and in general while it was a

218
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:30,269
little bit above normal the majority of

219
00:08:28,589 --> 00:08:32,610
the northern part of the Northeast

220
00:08:30,269 --> 00:08:34,949
hasn't accumulated many growing degree

221
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:36,930
days at all and we don't expect to

222
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:39,210
accumulate many this week this was last

223
00:08:36,929 --> 00:08:41,219
week and this is this week so we'll get

224
00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:43,979
a few into the metropolitan New York

225
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:47,340
area but since mark but since March

226
00:08:43,979 --> 00:08:49,620
first in northern climates you know

227
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:52,019
north of the Pennsylvania New York

228
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:53,700
border we haven't accumulated any base

229
00:08:52,019 --> 00:08:56,759
50 growing degree days

230
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:58,410
since the beginning of March alright and

231
00:08:56,759 --> 00:09:00,689
there's the growing degree day forecast

232
00:08:58,409 --> 00:09:02,639
now what does this all mean there's

233
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:04,380
going to be very little progress of the

234
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:06,179
growing season in the Northeast this

235
00:09:04,379 --> 00:09:08,669
coming week heck in upstate we're gonna

236
00:09:06,179 --> 00:09:10,679
get some we're gonna get some snow in

237
00:09:08,669 --> 00:09:13,769
many parts of upstate New York alright

238
00:09:10,679 --> 00:09:16,079
so when we look at this one measure of

239
00:09:13,769 --> 00:09:18,779
the potential of a cool season grass

240
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:20,490
plant to grow and you look at an average

241
00:09:18,779 --> 00:09:23,669
temperature of 50 degrees which we're

242
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:26,639
not even getting to yet that mark will

243
00:09:23,669 --> 00:09:28,589
gives us less than 25% of active growth

244
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:30,720
right we're not really getting much

245
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:32,790
active growth any mowing we're doing in

246
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:35,300
a lot of our northern areas could be

247
00:09:32,789 --> 00:09:37,829
related to just cleaning up

248
00:09:35,299 --> 00:09:39,990
recreational mowing keeping people busy

249
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:42,300
but if you're doing that we certainly

250
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:44,879
are promoting and we talked about last

251
00:09:42,299 --> 00:09:46,259
week in this venue raising the height of

252
00:09:44,879 --> 00:09:48,809
cut so we're not gonna go into the

253
00:09:46,259 --> 00:09:50,549
mowing situation again we encourage it

254
00:09:48,809 --> 00:09:53,159
last week pretty extensively in our

255
00:09:50,549 --> 00:09:55,199
webinar with Bill another great Nebraska

256
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:58,230
faculty now one of the things that's

257
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:59,790
going on throughout you know sports

258
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:01,590
fields everywhere is you know spring

259
00:09:59,789 --> 00:10:02,549
baseball would normally be happening and

260
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:04,500
again

261
00:10:02,549 --> 00:10:06,949
the Ohio State University gave a good

262
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:10,470
recommendation get the conditioner off

263
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:13,680
loose material store it roll and firm

264
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:16,410
the dirt right just into the infill and

265
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:18,779
pull straight weeds and raking may be

266
00:10:16,409 --> 00:10:20,610
needed now a lot of this can be minimal

267
00:10:18,779 --> 00:10:22,889
if you did a good job of putting the

268
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:25,169
skin to get to bed well right if you

269
00:10:22,889 --> 00:10:27,720
left it sort of in shambles last fall

270
00:10:25,169 --> 00:10:29,519
now it's going to be tougher to get it

271
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:31,769
to minimal maintenance now but if it's

272
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:33,659
nice and clean now it would ought to be

273
00:10:31,769 --> 00:10:35,519
pretty straightforward to keep it clean

274
00:10:33,659 --> 00:10:37,139
and there's some simple things you can

275
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:40,470
do to manage that that's unique to the

276
00:10:37,139 --> 00:10:43,669
sports fields now st ma has done a good

277
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:46,170
job and really relating a lot of great

278
00:10:43,669 --> 00:10:47,909
information from practical users and i

279
00:10:46,169 --> 00:10:52,259
stress this with every audience that i

280
00:10:47,909 --> 00:10:53,909
talk to this particular high school turf

281
00:10:52,259 --> 00:10:56,700
grass professor turfgrass science

282
00:10:53,909 --> 00:10:58,949
professor did an excellent job about how

283
00:10:56,700 --> 00:11:01,680
in talking to people about this issue

284
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:03,720
about moving traffic around about

285
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:06,149
coaching them and training them about

286
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:07,160
the way they like to learn and i think

287
00:11:06,149 --> 00:11:10,009
this kind of been for me

288
00:11:07,159 --> 00:11:12,379
is enormous ly valuable at this time

289
00:11:10,009 --> 00:11:14,959
when a lot of communication is important

290
00:11:12,379 --> 00:11:16,610
right no one's using the field what are

291
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:19,489
the realistic things we could be doing

292
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:22,100
out here so let me just finish up here

293
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:24,740
because this is the important stuff Rock

294
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:26,149
this is the stuff I know that you know

295
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:28,549
number one we've got a sports field

296
00:11:26,149 --> 00:11:31,100
website number two this is the

297
00:11:28,549 --> 00:11:32,990
cultivation practices that many wrote up

298
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:34,939
I know you've done a similar thing this

299
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:37,990
is the one on our sports field website

300
00:11:34,938 --> 00:11:42,078
let's start our conversation here and

301
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:44,568
let's first off say you know this is

302
00:11:42,078 --> 00:11:47,539
something that I've you know we write in

303
00:11:44,568 --> 00:11:49,789
our on our website and a document a

304
00:11:47,539 --> 00:11:52,759
little graphic about how it works in the

305
00:11:49,789 --> 00:11:54,799
soil generally I think these benefits

306
00:11:52,759 --> 00:11:57,769
are short-lived I want to talk a little

307
00:11:54,799 --> 00:12:02,688
bit about I want to stop sharing my

308
00:11:57,769 --> 00:12:05,120
screen and talk a little bit about there

309
00:12:02,688 --> 00:12:07,068
we go and talk a little bit about what

310
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:09,078
you think about cultivation a lot of

311
00:12:07,068 --> 00:12:12,620
guys are asking hey nobody's used in the

312
00:12:09,078 --> 00:12:14,958
field can i cultivate so where do we

313
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:17,299
start with that well you know I think

314
00:12:14,958 --> 00:12:20,828
it's an opportunity if we can find any

315
00:12:17,299 --> 00:12:23,299
benefit in this mess we're currently in

316
00:12:20,828 --> 00:12:24,859
and we do have some people locally I

317
00:12:23,299 --> 00:12:27,109
mean we're worried about the same growth

318
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:29,600
stage you guys are surprisingly in the

319
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:31,310
middle of the United States still you

320
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,990
know we're barely starting to mow the

321
00:12:31,309 --> 00:12:34,399
grass is barely starting to green up etc

322
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:36,230
we're a little bit further on growing

323
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:38,419
degree days and temperature but that

324
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:40,220
said you know since all the fields where

325
00:12:38,419 --> 00:12:42,019
community sports are played the ball

326
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:43,129
fields or whatever those are pretty well

327
00:12:42,019 --> 00:12:45,709
shut down but they're allowed to be

328
00:12:43,129 --> 00:12:47,389
maintained and I have managers much like

329
00:12:45,708 --> 00:12:49,309
you would ask any well should we do

330
00:12:47,389 --> 00:12:51,379
something and we've got some fields that

331
00:12:49,309 --> 00:12:54,828
rarely get cultivated and I see that as

332
00:12:51,379 --> 00:12:57,110
a door opening for some batch management

333
00:12:54,828 --> 00:12:58,519
and some cultivation management also

334
00:12:57,110 --> 00:13:00,709
understanding that they don't have the

335
00:12:58,519 --> 00:13:03,139
crew but nor do they have the necessity

336
00:13:00,708 --> 00:13:05,179
to bang this out in you know 24 hours or

337
00:13:03,139 --> 00:13:06,769
less so and get ready to play on so I'm

338
00:13:05,179 --> 00:13:09,679
going to say those fields that have been

339
00:13:06,769 --> 00:13:11,448
neglected for batch management and

340
00:13:09,679 --> 00:13:13,429
cultivation management this is an open

341
00:13:11,448 --> 00:13:14,870
door to get on those fields but if you

342
00:13:13,429 --> 00:13:17,208
went into the winter with a field in

343
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:18,709
pretty good shape and you normally would

344
00:13:17,208 --> 00:13:20,689
practice some sort of cultivation that

345
00:13:18,708 --> 00:13:23,059
might me to feel my considered not

346
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:25,010
getting on immediately and working on

347
00:13:23,059 --> 00:13:27,139
the ones that allow you the opportunity

348
00:13:25,009 --> 00:13:29,360
that you know the heavy playfields the

349
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:32,240
youth fields that sort of stuff and if

350
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:33,889
they're all mostly native soil with some

351
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:36,259
sand based in your neck of the woods

352
00:13:33,889 --> 00:13:39,679
right right okay so let's let's take

353
00:13:36,259 --> 00:13:41,569
let's take each one at a time here let's

354
00:13:39,679 --> 00:13:44,929
say there is a field that's a native

355
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:48,530
soil field and you know I got a guy or

356
00:13:44,929 --> 00:13:50,899
two and I got one of those really gigs

357
00:13:48,529 --> 00:13:55,129
with the you know the the just drug

358
00:13:50,899 --> 00:13:59,059
things that go in you know yo big I'm

359
00:13:55,129 --> 00:14:01,610
ready to do it what's the right tool now

360
00:13:59,059 --> 00:14:03,619
in your opinion you know we've we're on

361
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:05,419
the record about hollow tine cultivation

362
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:07,490
in San based systems and golf courses

363
00:14:05,419 --> 00:14:09,740
but we're talking about a little bit of

364
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:12,139
a different animal here so what's the

365
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:15,139
tool you might start with and how would

366
00:14:12,139 --> 00:14:16,939
you approach it well I'm going to say

367
00:14:15,139 --> 00:14:20,029
that the little whirligig thing that you

368
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:22,100
described as minimal use for actual

369
00:14:20,029 --> 00:14:23,750
compaction alleviation it's a great

370
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:25,820
overseeing tool right

371
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:27,559
it's what's up the soil a little bit on

372
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:29,660
the surface Frank but at the end of the

373
00:14:27,559 --> 00:14:32,629
day it really doesn't do much for

374
00:14:29,659 --> 00:14:34,669
subsurface compaction and it makes you

375
00:14:32,629 --> 00:14:36,350
feel good and maybe even people that

376
00:14:34,669 --> 00:14:38,629
manage the fields say oh look they're

377
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:40,610
out there working but seriously you're

378
00:14:38,629 --> 00:14:42,080
not doing much I'm especially now you

379
00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:43,940
lender you under exaggerated a little

380
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:46,040
bit you know some of them do actually go

381
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:49,430
to like maybe two inches but they are so

382
00:14:46,039 --> 00:14:51,439
superficial at best and if it's all you

383
00:14:49,429 --> 00:14:52,849
can do and you're over seeding and

384
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:54,970
you're looking at thatch rather than

385
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:58,399
true cultivation for compaction

386
00:14:54,970 --> 00:15:01,639
alleviation yeah but most of the time

387
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:02,959
they're really not that valuable except

388
00:15:01,639 --> 00:15:04,519
in those instances I said so I'm not a

389
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:05,120
big fan of those I don't think those

390
00:15:04,519 --> 00:15:06,649
drum-type

391
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:08,600
they don't have that high girl power

392
00:15:06,649 --> 00:15:11,419
around and they don't have the power you

393
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:13,970
know I really prefer the more golf

394
00:15:11,419 --> 00:15:16,699
course centric you know vertically

395
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:18,470
operated hollow tine in an instance with

396
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:20,210
a native soil field where you can pull

397
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:22,040
soil up and actually go to a certain

398
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:23,540
depth and even even deep tightening

399
00:15:22,039 --> 00:15:25,309
those in our region at least a deep

400
00:15:23,539 --> 00:15:26,509
diners are still out and doing it if you

401
00:15:25,309 --> 00:15:29,389
have a field that has not seen

402
00:15:26,509 --> 00:15:30,830
management and you've got a budget you

403
00:15:29,389 --> 00:15:32,449
know once again these are all qualifiers

404
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:34,430
you know maybe you want to go in an

405
00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:38,390
aggressively truly deep

406
00:15:34,429 --> 00:15:41,229
they rather than the surface disruption

407
00:15:38,389 --> 00:15:45,289
thing you do with those pull behind

408
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:47,330
non-driven time right sorry so so here's

409
00:15:45,289 --> 00:15:50,569
the thing for us here in the Northeast

410
00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:52,670
now Rock we just got a forecast this

411
00:15:50,570 --> 00:15:54,709
morning that says we're in for anywhere

412
00:15:52,669 --> 00:15:57,199
I would say from three-quarters of an

413
00:15:54,708 --> 00:15:59,329
inch at the low end to as much as two

414
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:03,170
plus inches of rain over the next four

415
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:05,389
to five days let's think through the way

416
00:16:03,169 --> 00:16:08,149
we approach cultivation from a soil

417
00:16:05,389 --> 00:16:10,639
moisture perspective right so what kinds

418
00:16:08,149 --> 00:16:13,700
of soil moisture conditions on these

419
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:16,220
neglected fields are going to be the

420
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:19,220
kinds of conditions I want to Drew these

421
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:21,769
practices well certainly not wet right

422
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:23,629
you know but the drier they are within

423
00:16:21,769 --> 00:16:25,250
reason of keeping the plant alive the

424
00:16:23,629 --> 00:16:26,990
drier they are the more apt you're going

425
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:28,940
to get to some in addition if you're

426
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:30,320
using a quarantine you know you'll get

427
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:32,120
some depth obviously but at the same

428
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,920
time you know you get some shattering

429
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:35,600
even with a slicer dying or a spoon

430
00:16:33,919 --> 00:16:37,879
dying or a lot of the things like that

431
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:39,709
so you know you want them on the drier

432
00:16:37,879 --> 00:16:41,600
side what do you think about what you

433
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:43,699
just described so you run it over a

434
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:45,860
field that's dry and then you get this

435
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:47,690
rain and you've got you know silty clay

436
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:49,039
loans or clay loans or whatever you have

437
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:51,589
in your region I'm thinking they leaned

438
00:16:49,039 --> 00:16:53,870
towards the heavier side you know they

439
00:16:51,589 --> 00:16:55,820
expand and then you've sort of lost what

440
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:57,950
you did so you're better off looking for

441
00:16:55,820 --> 00:17:01,190
a time when you're gonna have a period

442
00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:02,660
of dry drying or dry soil and then get

443
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:04,490
on them with these devices that are

444
00:17:02,659 --> 00:17:06,349
actually benefit from the soil being a

445
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:08,000
little bit dry and literally shattering

446
00:17:06,349 --> 00:17:10,519
it as they go in and out and moving

447
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:13,130
across okay so then let's talk about go

448
00:17:10,519 --> 00:17:15,049
back to a tool now if I really like

449
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:16,970
shattering to me in a lot of these

450
00:17:15,049 --> 00:17:19,129
native soils I think it's actually one

451
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:21,500
of the fundamental things that you know

452
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:23,720
will give you this widespread macro pore

453
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:28,329
flow if you hit it in the sweet spot if

454
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:31,819
you had to pick one thing would you take

455
00:17:28,329 --> 00:17:35,899
Verta drain with a kick over a hollow

456
00:17:31,819 --> 00:17:38,000
time pulling a core no doubt I would be

457
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:39,740
like on native soil fields I don't think

458
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,660
there's any question I believe that much

459
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:42,558
like you you know record it today

460
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:45,140
because I think we're in a hundred

461
00:17:42,558 --> 00:17:46,490
percent agreement on this recorded today

462
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:48,620
I believe that that's where you get the

463
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:50,569
most benefit you get continuing

464
00:17:48,619 --> 00:17:52,519
the pores from the surface you get a lot

465
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:55,220
of things going on that you don't get

466
00:17:52,519 --> 00:17:57,079
with a single hollow tine you know that

467
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:58,670
and that kicks important and most of

468
00:17:57,079 --> 00:18:00,740
these devices are designed to give you

469
00:17:58,670 --> 00:18:02,539
kick and you can adjust it on some of

470
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:03,769
them but even a spoon time at a

471
00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:05,990
different speed will give you a

472
00:18:03,769 --> 00:18:07,759
different kick than one that you know

473
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:09,230
and another speed right so you want to

474
00:18:07,759 --> 00:18:11,240
get as much kick as you honor and you

475
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:14,058
want the soil to be a little on the dry

476
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:17,089
side right you don't want it wet so what

477
00:18:14,058 --> 00:18:18,920
about this new concoction the heir to G

478
00:18:17,089 --> 00:18:20,509
I know Soraka has been playing around

479
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:23,690
with it have you paid attention at all

480
00:18:20,509 --> 00:18:27,799
to that being a noninvasive certainly

481
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:30,500
it's slow and so in some cases it might

482
00:18:27,799 --> 00:18:31,609
be good for targeted cultivation and

483
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,900
we're going to get the targeted

484
00:18:31,609 --> 00:18:34,879
cultivation in a minute you don't have

485
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:37,280
to do an oil field maybe there's some

486
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:40,040
places where it needs it most air 2g

487
00:18:37,279 --> 00:18:41,420
what do you think I think they just as

488
00:18:40,039 --> 00:18:42,799
he just described it you know I almost

489
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:44,900
filled in the blanks there Frank because

490
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:47,480
I think that that you do see some

491
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:48,590
benefit this the speed of it which is

492
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:50,480
going to be less of an issue now and

493
00:18:48,589 --> 00:18:52,490
we're not seeing play on the fields the

494
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:55,130
speed of it and I like that prescription

495
00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:57,019
area cultivation you know if you have

496
00:18:55,130 --> 00:18:58,820
enough we didn't generally do the whole

497
00:18:57,019 --> 00:19:00,019
field in one method right we've got

498
00:18:58,819 --> 00:19:01,730
these little areas that you can do

499
00:19:00,019 --> 00:19:04,460
different things on if you have the

500
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:06,049
technology and and you know or the

501
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:09,170
contractor can come in and and do

502
00:19:06,049 --> 00:19:11,210
targeted prescription cultivation sure I

503
00:19:09,170 --> 00:19:13,550
think that there there could be some

504
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:15,710
value in there to G I have not seen the

505
00:19:13,549 --> 00:19:17,329
data up close and personal so I'm not

506
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:19,670
ready to widespread say yeah that's the

507
00:19:17,329 --> 00:19:21,230
device you want to use um but you know

508
00:19:19,670 --> 00:19:23,179
Soraka is looking at it looking at it

509
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:24,620
fairly close and he's another one you

510
00:19:23,179 --> 00:19:26,480
mentioned some earlier people premiere

511
00:19:24,619 --> 00:19:28,669
people in sports turf obviously he's

512
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:30,620
another one of the rock stars and what

513
00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:32,179
he's doing is you know usually he takes

514
00:19:30,619 --> 00:19:35,449
the time and understands that and fully

515
00:19:32,179 --> 00:19:37,340
exploit it researches it before he

516
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:38,480
starts making recommendations and you

517
00:19:37,339 --> 00:19:39,919
know I don't think he's come out and

518
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:42,259
said yeah this is the new tool for the

519
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:44,090
Millennial it's this is the new tool

520
00:19:42,259 --> 00:19:45,679
that we're looking at right yeah and I

521
00:19:44,089 --> 00:19:48,049
did you see in that now let's go back

522
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:50,390
for a second to you know bringing up

523
00:19:48,049 --> 00:19:53,058
soil for soil sake or hollow tine

524
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:55,460
cultivation how worried should I be in

525
00:19:53,058 --> 00:19:58,099
general as a weed site as a fellow weed

526
00:19:55,460 --> 00:20:01,160
scientist I know you are how worried

527
00:19:58,099 --> 00:20:02,000
will I be about you know now my soil is

528
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:04,490
wet I'm

529
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:07,339
this is a good idea I'm gonna plan to do

530
00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:10,009
it in this window in a few weeks if I'm

531
00:20:07,339 --> 00:20:12,980
still not open bla bla bla how much do

532
00:20:10,009 --> 00:20:16,038
we worry later we go with this to create

533
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:18,528
potential weed problems that's a great

534
00:20:16,038 --> 00:20:19,819
question Frank because this is what if

535
00:20:18,528 --> 00:20:21,230
you if you're on one of your higher

536
00:20:19,819 --> 00:20:23,089
maintained fields and you've been

537
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:25,399
routinely applying pre-emergent and

538
00:20:23,089 --> 00:20:26,990
doing broadleaf weed control I don't see

539
00:20:25,398 --> 00:20:28,428
bringing soil to the surface as much of

540
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:31,190
a problem because over time you've

541
00:20:28,429 --> 00:20:32,419
reduced the soil seed bank right and you

542
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:34,548
know I mean this is true in golf it's

543
00:20:32,419 --> 00:20:36,919
true and sports turf but I worry about a

544
00:20:34,548 --> 00:20:38,869
field that's on the margin that doesn't

545
00:20:36,919 --> 00:20:41,450
get the aggressive pre-emergent

546
00:20:38,869 --> 00:20:43,128
application or post-emergent control for

547
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:45,230
annual grasses or whatever the case may

548
00:20:43,128 --> 00:20:46,969
be so you know laying underneath that

549
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:49,069
surface that's a full weed scientist

550
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:51,048
there is just a seed bank that's ready

551
00:20:49,069 --> 00:20:53,689
to pop and I don't care whether it's

552
00:20:51,048 --> 00:20:55,970
annual bluegrass or crabgrass or you

553
00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:58,399
know you get loose grass open up in your

554
00:20:55,970 --> 00:21:00,919
neck of the woods we are alarmingly

555
00:20:58,398 --> 00:21:03,949
getting more and more further and

556
00:21:00,919 --> 00:21:06,019
further north says Matt Elmore yes so

557
00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:07,490
that's alarming because that's not a

558
00:21:06,019 --> 00:21:11,628
weed you want because it requires a

559
00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:13,638
whole different toolbox of herbicides to

560
00:21:11,628 --> 00:21:15,678
actually in effective control and in

561
00:21:13,638 --> 00:21:17,388
sports fields in our area this grass is

562
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:19,460
far more problematic than crabgrass

563
00:21:17,388 --> 00:21:21,678
because it whose grass loves those

564
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:24,710
compacted soils right in front of gold

565
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:27,019
boxes you know in in the run-through on

566
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:28,940
first base we see goose if I want to

567
00:21:27,019 --> 00:21:31,308
isolate it I'll go there first right

568
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:32,330
that's where you see it so so so those

569
00:21:31,308 --> 00:21:34,278
are the kind of things that I would

570
00:21:32,329 --> 00:21:37,460
worry about on a marginal field where

571
00:21:34,278 --> 00:21:38,628
you're you haven't been maintaining it

572
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:40,190
at the level that you might your

573
00:21:38,628 --> 00:21:42,378
championship field or whatever and

574
00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:44,389
you're gonna bring up a ton of weed seed

575
00:21:42,378 --> 00:21:46,278
when you do that and then also open it

576
00:21:44,388 --> 00:21:48,048
up for any weak seed that blows in to

577
00:21:46,278 --> 00:21:50,000
fall into this convenient hole that

578
00:21:48,048 --> 00:21:53,388
doesn't collapse in on itself as quickly

579
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:55,669
as a spoon tine or a slicer tomato or

580
00:21:53,388 --> 00:21:58,428
even a solid time right so let's talk

581
00:21:55,669 --> 00:22:01,100
about a non-invasive way then before we

582
00:21:58,429 --> 00:22:04,399
start taking a couple of questions the

583
00:22:01,099 --> 00:22:07,219
airway we've we've been a fan and not a

584
00:22:04,398 --> 00:22:09,500
fan and then a fan in some places of the

585
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:12,048
airway that stands behind a tractor it's

586
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:14,148
just these knives that go in and makes a

587
00:22:12,048 --> 00:22:15,079
slit maybe four to six inches down I

588
00:22:14,148 --> 00:22:17,808
think maybe

589
00:22:15,079 --> 00:22:20,089
bit of shattering but the beauty of it

590
00:22:17,808 --> 00:22:22,460
is in the in my mind the attraction

591
00:22:20,089 --> 00:22:25,519
initially is you can do it really

592
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:27,798
rapidly and it seems to create a slit

593
00:22:25,519 --> 00:22:29,929
now we had some problem on our finer

594
00:22:27,798 --> 00:22:32,720
fields where it actually does a lot of

595
00:22:29,929 --> 00:22:35,360
tearing and and seems to cause some sort

596
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:37,130
of browning but I wonder on these fields

597
00:22:35,359 --> 00:22:40,158
that maybe don't get a lot of attention

598
00:22:37,130 --> 00:22:42,890
now that we could spend some attention

599
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:44,450
on practice fields and otherwise well

600
00:22:42,890 --> 00:22:46,460
how do you I know there's not a lot of

601
00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:48,409
research in this area but I'm just

602
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:51,950
thinking about the time going in and

603
00:22:48,409 --> 00:22:54,350
being really fast to do - now the area

604
00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:56,149
or devices like lat the slicer time you

605
00:22:54,349 --> 00:22:58,189
know I mean obviously if you can get it

606
00:22:56,148 --> 00:22:59,898
in three to four to five inches that's

607
00:22:58,190 --> 00:23:02,360
better than one to two because then we

608
00:22:59,898 --> 00:23:04,548
you know create other issues you know

609
00:23:02,359 --> 00:23:06,469
and minerally did some work I was at one

610
00:23:04,548 --> 00:23:09,288
of the Iowa State field days when he was

611
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:11,778
still physically on campus and you know

612
00:23:09,288 --> 00:23:14,148
he went to directions and everyone wants

613
00:23:11,778 --> 00:23:16,490
to go perpendicular no you go in an

614
00:23:14,148 --> 00:23:18,500
angle in your second pass right you know

615
00:23:16,490 --> 00:23:20,599
his data show that you go as an angle

616
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:23,720
and you pick up more surface area as

617
00:23:20,599 --> 00:23:25,278
well as more aggressively get better

618
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:27,169
aeration or whatever in the in the

619
00:23:25,278 --> 00:23:28,730
subsurface in the subsoil so I thought

620
00:23:27,169 --> 00:23:32,059
that was intriguing so he's like go at a

621
00:23:28,730 --> 00:23:34,509
30 to the first pass not at a 90 but

622
00:23:32,058 --> 00:23:38,388
when he said that on fields that were

623
00:23:34,509 --> 00:23:40,278
you know typical recreational fields or

624
00:23:38,388 --> 00:23:41,719
whatever he saw that open it up and then

625
00:23:40,278 --> 00:23:43,339
he always you know he says if you're

626
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:45,500
gonna slice up a field you should always

627
00:23:43,339 --> 00:23:46,908
throw out feed and I've always believed

628
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:48,349
that there's a reason for that as well

629
00:23:46,909 --> 00:23:50,419
because even if you only get 20 percent

630
00:23:48,349 --> 00:23:52,308
germination you got 20 percent

631
00:23:50,419 --> 00:23:53,840
germination right and that seed that

632
00:23:52,308 --> 00:23:55,700
wasn't there and especially on these

633
00:23:53,839 --> 00:23:57,199
fields that are less so so I like the

634
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:58,940
use of a slicer time whether it's an

635
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:03,649
airway or whatever and you nailed it you

636
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:05,200
can get across a field you get in less

637
00:24:03,648 --> 00:24:08,000
time than it takes to do a traditional

638
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:09,950
you know vertically operated hollow

639
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,388
dying or device like that right so you

640
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:14,600
can get on it and get on it frequently

641
00:24:11,388 --> 00:24:16,579
too for that matter even if you're a

642
00:24:14,599 --> 00:24:18,439
skeleton crew you know I see a few

643
00:24:16,579 --> 00:24:20,839
things you know guys are still keeping

644
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:22,340
paint in their corner lines so they

645
00:24:20,839 --> 00:24:24,259
don't have to redo the whole field

646
00:24:22,339 --> 00:24:26,990
they're just going out on the fields and

647
00:24:24,259 --> 00:24:28,819
putting into corner markers so that they

648
00:24:26,990 --> 00:24:30,798
can string lines from there

649
00:24:28,819 --> 00:24:33,859
so there's a lot of things guys even

650
00:24:30,798 --> 00:24:36,138
with a small crew can do to save some

651
00:24:33,859 --> 00:24:38,658
time do these sorts of things and then

652
00:24:36,138 --> 00:24:40,490
the question of well you know I'm a

653
00:24:38,659 --> 00:24:41,899
little bit further south I got a little

654
00:24:40,490 --> 00:24:43,970
bit more money I got this unit

655
00:24:41,898 --> 00:24:47,000
University field it is high in municipal

656
00:24:43,970 --> 00:24:49,278
field should i core and consider san

657
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:51,798
topdressing I got this sand from last

658
00:24:49,278 --> 00:24:55,788
year what do you like about slinging

659
00:24:51,798 --> 00:24:57,980
sand on this native soil fields you know

660
00:24:55,788 --> 00:24:59,240
we've caught him and we're starting and

661
00:24:57,980 --> 00:25:02,389
thinking hey maybe this is a good time

662
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:04,460
to get him a sand cap on him what do you

663
00:25:02,388 --> 00:25:08,359
like that approach throwing some sand at

664
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:11,538
this time I like sand camping if you're

665
00:25:08,359 --> 00:25:13,908
committed to doing it forever if you're

666
00:25:11,538 --> 00:25:16,548
committed to doing it once then that's a

667
00:25:13,909 --> 00:25:18,830
horrible combination already you got to

668
00:25:16,548 --> 00:25:21,440
put a cap on it and that cap has to be

669
00:25:18,829 --> 00:25:23,119
developed over time and and you know we

670
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:24,528
didn't you know we always revert back to

671
00:25:23,119 --> 00:25:26,479
the golf course trade right you know

672
00:25:24,528 --> 00:25:28,038
they started with push up greens then

673
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:30,259
they started top dressing and it's not

674
00:25:28,038 --> 00:25:31,908
until they get an official the layer of

675
00:25:30,259 --> 00:25:33,528
sand on them so if this is something you

676
00:25:31,909 --> 00:25:35,590
just want to do like in a short term and

677
00:25:33,528 --> 00:25:37,339
not commit to it it's a horrible idea

678
00:25:35,589 --> 00:25:39,019
that's so great

679
00:25:37,339 --> 00:25:41,509
all right Carl we got any questions how

680
00:25:39,019 --> 00:25:44,240
we doing doing great we have no

681
00:25:41,509 --> 00:25:45,740
questions so maybe one thing I had a

682
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:48,980
question on it's a lot of people will

683
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:50,870
typically go out they'll do their core

684
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:52,730
cultivation or whatever cultivation

685
00:25:50,869 --> 00:25:55,339
practice and then they'll go maybe throw

686
00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:56,960
some seed and then fertilizer you know

687
00:25:55,339 --> 00:25:58,819
thinking about the fertilizer part of

688
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:01,129
that now is that something you're gonna

689
00:25:58,819 --> 00:26:03,288
need after you do this this cultivation

690
00:26:01,128 --> 00:26:05,298
practice or can you say hey maybe I've

691
00:26:03,288 --> 00:26:07,970
got a bunch of time and not have to

692
00:26:05,298 --> 00:26:09,589
worry about I like that question only

693
00:26:07,970 --> 00:26:11,839
because right now you really don't want

694
00:26:09,589 --> 00:26:13,970
things growing as aggressively as you

695
00:26:11,839 --> 00:26:16,519
normally would right so I'm gonna say

696
00:26:13,970 --> 00:26:18,980
there's adequate soil nutrition to get

697
00:26:16,519 --> 00:26:20,028
seed going and you know and then

698
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:21,759
hopefully this is going to break

699
00:26:20,028 --> 00:26:24,048
sometime in the not-too-distant future

700
00:26:21,759 --> 00:26:25,819
you know you said I think you said

701
00:26:24,048 --> 00:26:27,528
something like late June or whatever you

702
00:26:25,819 --> 00:26:29,298
know we're a little bit behind you in in

703
00:26:27,528 --> 00:26:31,788
our region but you know we're looking at

704
00:26:29,298 --> 00:26:34,250
probably August before we're gonna be

705
00:26:31,788 --> 00:26:36,589
through our worst worst age we haven't

706
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:37,909
peaked yet in central United States so

707
00:26:36,589 --> 00:26:40,819
we're gonna peak in about three weeks

708
00:26:37,909 --> 00:26:42,840
with Koh bid nineteen so we're gonna be

709
00:26:40,819 --> 00:26:46,349
a little bit later but still that said

710
00:26:42,839 --> 00:26:48,029
I am NOT going to fertilize if if I

711
00:26:46,349 --> 00:26:49,769
don't think it's absolutely necessary in

712
00:26:48,029 --> 00:26:51,629
the field says to do it I think that

713
00:26:49,769 --> 00:26:53,400
we're just inviting growth you've got a

714
00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:55,260
limited crew you're gonna increase your

715
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:56,820
mowing and I'm sure you probably talked

716
00:26:55,259 --> 00:26:58,950
about raising mowing Heights and maybe

717
00:26:56,819 --> 00:27:00,629
the use of regulators you know flying

718
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:02,460
fertilizer and growth regulators it's

719
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:04,290
kind of contrary to each other so yeah I

720
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:06,059
would say yeah don't you'd normally put

721
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:07,259
down a starter and you'd normally push

722
00:27:06,059 --> 00:27:08,940
it fairly hard because you want that

723
00:27:07,259 --> 00:27:11,039
seed to get up and going but that's

724
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:13,170
because we want to get people on it no

725
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:15,539
longer have that problem right so I

726
00:27:13,170 --> 00:27:17,789
would not unless something tells you you

727
00:27:15,539 --> 00:27:19,879
have to more times than not you don't

728
00:27:17,789 --> 00:27:23,279
need to put additional fertility don't

729
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:25,170
love the idea sling and seed rock I mean

730
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:27,269
you got bare ground throat a damn seed

731
00:27:25,170 --> 00:27:29,880
it's got the best chance ever with

732
00:27:27,269 --> 00:27:32,970
nobody playing around on it and you cut

733
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:34,650
and hire to me if you had chronic areas

734
00:27:32,970 --> 00:27:37,049
this is where the targeted precision

735
00:27:34,650 --> 00:27:40,200
thing comes from in my mind is this you

736
00:27:37,049 --> 00:27:42,569
know Eagle mouths or where coaches and

737
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:45,930
players stand or you know wherever those

738
00:27:42,569 --> 00:27:48,059
pinch points are you focusing in on

739
00:27:45,930 --> 00:27:50,009
those areas with a guy or two you know

740
00:27:48,059 --> 00:27:52,799
you can get a couple of gold mouths done

741
00:27:50,009 --> 00:27:54,930
and if you know a day if you want to cut

742
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:57,450
it out and redo it or just sling some

743
00:27:54,930 --> 00:27:59,430
seed as you're passing by no harm no

744
00:27:57,450 --> 00:28:01,830
foul there right Rock well no exactly

745
00:27:59,430 --> 00:28:03,299
right I'm a big fan and seed I mean I

746
00:28:01,829 --> 00:28:05,369
know it adds to your budget but it's not

747
00:28:03,299 --> 00:28:06,450
that expensive and you know I mean

748
00:28:05,369 --> 00:28:08,699
seriously when you look at the other

749
00:28:06,450 --> 00:28:10,529
things you do on a day to day basis it's

750
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:12,569
not really that expensive and I would I

751
00:28:10,529 --> 00:28:14,609
would put even during regular play you

752
00:28:12,569 --> 00:28:16,589
know under normal times I would be

753
00:28:14,609 --> 00:28:18,089
throwing seed out and I you know people

754
00:28:16,589 --> 00:28:19,439
say well you mean rye grass I'm not

755
00:28:18,089 --> 00:28:21,509
talking about rye grass I'm talking

756
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:23,880
about you know so if you only get 10%

757
00:28:21,509 --> 00:28:26,720
germination that's 10% more than you had

758
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:29,250
right and and so yeah I'm all for

759
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:30,720
throwing seed out at any time it was

760
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:32,309
interesting you know once again cruising

761
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:34,230
around with men or one time in Iowa and

762
00:28:32,309 --> 00:28:36,179
we were taking compaction measurements

763
00:28:34,230 --> 00:28:38,519
across these fields and the worst place

764
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:40,350
is where the players stand you know

765
00:28:38,519 --> 00:28:41,789
nothing grows there and some people have

766
00:28:40,349 --> 00:28:43,829
put carpet there don't leave me eight

767
00:28:41,789 --> 00:28:45,769
that problem but that was and so I would

768
00:28:43,829 --> 00:28:48,899
be throwing seed out there constantly

769
00:28:45,769 --> 00:28:51,029
right now every time you do anything and

770
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:52,620
open it up even a little bit or bare oil

771
00:28:51,029 --> 00:28:54,420
bearers like you said in front of gold

772
00:28:52,619 --> 00:28:56,129
mouse or you know wherever it were that

773
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:56,850
you know between hash marks where you

774
00:28:56,130 --> 00:28:58,830
know those

775
00:28:56,849 --> 00:29:00,058
exist let's get it really dense turf

776
00:28:58,829 --> 00:29:01,710
going there because you're gonna be

777
00:29:00,058 --> 00:29:02,970
mowing higher just gonna get a really

778
00:29:01,710 --> 00:29:04,769
nice root system on it because you're

779
00:29:02,970 --> 00:29:06,450
mowing iron all the things that throw in

780
00:29:04,769 --> 00:29:08,819
the agronomy of it that we ignore

781
00:29:06,450 --> 00:29:11,460
because we're trying to maintain a slick

782
00:29:08,819 --> 00:29:13,740
playing surface right right yeah throw

783
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:15,569
seed out no dad and and you know you

784
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:17,519
brought up one more thing Carl before we

785
00:29:15,569 --> 00:29:20,189
go we're here at almost at the witching

786
00:29:17,519 --> 00:29:23,638
hour and and the idea of cutting back

787
00:29:20,190 --> 00:29:25,500
mowing rock to root deeper ties in with

788
00:29:23,638 --> 00:29:28,199
one of the reasons we poke holes to

789
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:30,509
begin with if you can do that shattering

790
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:33,419
and combine it with mowing higher and

791
00:29:30,509 --> 00:29:36,000
less frequently those roots will explore

792
00:29:33,419 --> 00:29:38,429
the shattering that you do as deep as

793
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:40,079
you do it yes oh no no because you know

794
00:29:38,429 --> 00:29:41,700
what do we tell our introductory

795
00:29:40,079 --> 00:29:43,798
students where the roots grow and they

796
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:45,659
say soil notes say no they grew in the

797
00:29:43,798 --> 00:29:48,089
air spaces in the soil I know that

798
00:29:45,659 --> 00:29:49,409
sounds rudimentary but it's true if you

799
00:29:48,089 --> 00:29:51,750
don't have air space you don't get

800
00:29:49,409 --> 00:29:54,149
routing so those heavily targeted

801
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:56,579
prescription areas throw some feet out

802
00:29:54,148 --> 00:29:58,528
get some kind of cultivation in native

803
00:29:56,579 --> 00:30:00,388
soils a little bit drier is better and

804
00:29:58,528 --> 00:30:02,369
don't really need to pull a core at this

805
00:30:00,388 --> 00:30:04,678
point done excellent all right Carl I

806
00:30:02,369 --> 00:30:07,739
see questions how we doing yeah we got a

807
00:30:04,679 --> 00:30:10,288
good question from Neil at RIT so he's

808
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:12,179
asking I've got a natural soil field and

809
00:30:10,288 --> 00:30:14,788
let's say I'm committed to to putting

810
00:30:12,179 --> 00:30:16,679
the sand cap on it how much sand should

811
00:30:14,788 --> 00:30:18,359
go down and then how many times per year

812
00:30:16,679 --> 00:30:19,919
I guess you know how quickly can you do

813
00:30:18,359 --> 00:30:21,269
that could you do that all at once right

814
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:23,340
now is that something you're gonna have

815
00:30:21,269 --> 00:30:25,980
to consider over two or three years so

816
00:30:23,339 --> 00:30:27,869
let's start with this rock I think we're

817
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:30,210
in agreement the caps got to be about

818
00:30:27,869 --> 00:30:32,729
three to four inches maybe with a slit

819
00:30:30,210 --> 00:30:36,028
drain or something underneath so I think

820
00:30:32,730 --> 00:30:37,950
the the superintendent's out in Seattle

821
00:30:36,028 --> 00:30:40,109
were able to put down an inch and a half

822
00:30:37,950 --> 00:30:42,899
in a single year when they were trying

823
00:30:40,109 --> 00:30:43,949
to fight worms years and years ago but

824
00:30:42,898 --> 00:30:46,138
that was ridiculous

825
00:30:43,950 --> 00:30:47,819
yeah was they were doing some smothering

826
00:30:46,138 --> 00:30:50,519
and you know I mean like that's a lot of

827
00:30:47,819 --> 00:30:52,829
sand and one you know and one in one

828
00:30:50,519 --> 00:30:54,990
year even right you know so we we know

829
00:30:52,829 --> 00:30:58,288
you're putting on about about an inch

830
00:30:54,990 --> 00:31:01,378
with about 22 cubic yards on you know

831
00:30:58,288 --> 00:31:03,808
our acuity feet sorry 4,000 per year so

832
00:31:01,378 --> 00:31:05,428
if you wanted to put on an inch that's

833
00:31:03,808 --> 00:31:06,690
what it's going to take if you wanted to

834
00:31:05,429 --> 00:31:09,509
put on 2 inches it would take twice that

835
00:31:06,690 --> 00:31:10,350
I'm not sure any term even under no play

836
00:31:09,509 --> 00:31:12,150
conditions

837
00:31:10,349 --> 00:31:13,980
I'm sure you've been aggressively with

838
00:31:12,150 --> 00:31:15,509
that much sand on so you would have to

839
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:17,400
commit you want to have three to four

840
00:31:15,509 --> 00:31:18,569
inches on the cap of course that's going

841
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:19,650
to change the contour and you're gonna

842
00:31:18,569 --> 00:31:21,779
have to move it accordingly

843
00:31:19,650 --> 00:31:23,240
especially in crown fields if you know

844
00:31:21,779 --> 00:31:25,289
on a ground football field for example

845
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:27,120
some of the soccer fields obviously

846
00:31:25,289 --> 00:31:28,680
that's less of an issue but still you do

847
00:31:27,119 --> 00:31:32,039
want some slope on the surface to get

848
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:34,019
water off yeah you know that's important

849
00:31:32,039 --> 00:31:36,329
you know native soil fields begin to

850
00:31:34,019 --> 00:31:37,799
function by having a crown we many

851
00:31:36,329 --> 00:31:39,210
people don't really think about this

852
00:31:37,799 --> 00:31:41,399
anymore because we've had sand based

853
00:31:39,210 --> 00:31:44,579
systems for so long that you don't see

854
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:45,960
the heavy Crown's like you used to so it

855
00:31:44,579 --> 00:31:47,819
is important if you're gonna do some

856
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:49,799
capping that you know you do it in

857
00:31:47,819 --> 00:31:51,659
relation to the subsoil like you would

858
00:31:49,799 --> 00:31:53,639
do a putting surface and really for it

859
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:55,170
to function you got to have some some

860
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:57,030
drains along the side you got to have

861
00:31:55,170 --> 00:31:58,740
some catch drains otherwise the place

862
00:31:57,029 --> 00:32:00,720
where rock and I just said you get the

863
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:01,980
most traffic by the coaches is where

864
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:04,019
you're putting all the water if you

865
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:05,460
don't pick it up yeah it's gonna it's

866
00:32:04,019 --> 00:32:08,129
just going to pawn there you're exactly

867
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:09,720
right and and you know the sand will

868
00:32:08,130 --> 00:32:11,730
flow but you know that on that interface

869
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:13,860
in between it's gonna saturate top

870
00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:15,990
before it goes below right so it sheets

871
00:32:13,859 --> 00:32:17,399
off right and so you get on the side you

872
00:32:15,990 --> 00:32:19,230
know eventually you'll get so much on

873
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:20,580
the surface and you know they'll there

874
00:32:19,230 --> 00:32:22,380
will be some men are mixing and fruits

875
00:32:20,579 --> 00:32:25,289
and so that you'll get stability on the

876
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:27,720
surface but that doesn't happen um you

877
00:32:25,289 --> 00:32:30,690
know without several years of aggressive

878
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:32,670
top dressing probably multiple you know

879
00:32:30,690 --> 00:32:35,160
or removal if you want to do it more

880
00:32:32,670 --> 00:32:36,660
aggressively drier soils you could

881
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:38,670
probably solid sign it and get there

882
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:40,529
just just as quick because I'm a big fan

883
00:32:38,670 --> 00:32:42,539
of using the solid line even on native

884
00:32:40,529 --> 00:32:43,829
fields when they're dry not when we have

885
00:32:42,539 --> 00:32:46,319
the moisture issues we talked about

886
00:32:43,829 --> 00:32:49,769
right alright Carl how are we doing

887
00:32:46,319 --> 00:32:51,960
questions good no more questions I think

888
00:32:49,769 --> 00:32:53,940
we're right at right at half an hour so

889
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:57,390
you know classes thirty minutes and turf

890
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:59,759
I think we're calling it so much for

891
00:32:57,390 --> 00:33:04,560
joining us you happy to do anything Carl

892
00:32:59,759 --> 00:33:08,160
yep right back here next week

893
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:10,589
thank you ready take care this has been
