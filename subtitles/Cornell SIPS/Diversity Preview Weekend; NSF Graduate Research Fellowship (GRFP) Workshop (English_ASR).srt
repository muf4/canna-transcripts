1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,059
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:08,308
University cool okay thanks for bearing

3
00:00:06,059 --> 00:00:10,050
with me so this is just a quick overview

4
00:00:08,308 --> 00:00:12,480
of where we're going to be going in

5
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:14,759
about the next hour so we'll start off

6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:23,518
talking a little bit about fellowships

7
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:26,849
and grants what they are one fellowship

8
00:00:23,518 --> 00:00:28,018
and that's the G RSP so we'll start out

9
00:00:26,849 --> 00:00:30,480
by talking about some of that

10
00:00:28,018 --> 00:00:32,789
eligibility and the rules associated

11
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,980
with this and then we'll kind of walk

12
00:00:32,789 --> 00:00:37,579
you through what it's like to apply

13
00:00:34,979 --> 00:00:41,069
starting off kind of big picture

14
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:42,840
contacting factoids me and kind of

15
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:45,390
developing your project and then we'll

16
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:51,809
go into some of the more nitty-gritty

17
00:00:45,390 --> 00:01:08,280
details of how that works so did you

18
00:00:51,808 --> 00:01:11,259
okay so just a little bit I didn't get

19
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:16,989
it and then I reapplied during my first

20
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:16,989
[Music]

21
00:01:22,579 --> 00:01:28,349
I'd say maybe uncommon and a lot so

22
00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:32,130
people change their research a lot after

23
00:01:28,349 --> 00:01:35,578
writing the application and my name is

24
00:01:32,129 --> 00:01:37,679
Lauren I also fights the NSF GFP during

25
00:01:35,578 --> 00:01:39,209
a vacation to grad school and it was not

26
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,250
funded but it was a great way for me to

27
00:01:39,209 --> 00:01:43,228
a work of my advisor and we're going to

28
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:45,359
project together and I'm still working

29
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:51,420
on that similar project through

30
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:53,930
different funding source and we're here

31
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:53,930
to answer questions

32
00:02:00,049 --> 00:02:06,719
okay so scholarships fellowships grants

33
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,430
what's the difference so this language

34
00:02:06,718 --> 00:02:09,699
kind of get

35
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:13,129
[Music]

36
00:02:09,699 --> 00:02:14,899
to kind of the same types of funding

37
00:02:13,128 --> 00:02:17,509
opportunities with different language

38
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:19,879
but in general I think that scholarship

39
00:02:17,509 --> 00:02:22,568
is something that's just paying your

40
00:02:19,878 --> 00:02:25,068
tuition to help you go to school

41
00:02:22,568 --> 00:02:27,708
fellowships are something that I

42
00:02:25,068 --> 00:02:30,949
generally think of as paying your salary

43
00:02:27,709 --> 00:02:34,128
or like us while you're in school just

44
00:02:30,949 --> 00:02:37,039
awesome and then grants might do that as

45
00:02:34,128 --> 00:02:49,548
well or they might be more for research

46
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:51,560
funding so why so it's definitely

47
00:02:49,549 --> 00:03:01,340
possible that applying just increases

48
00:02:51,560 --> 00:03:04,489
your chances and then life with funding

49
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:09,739
is easier so when you come into a

50
00:03:04,489 --> 00:03:13,299
program with your own funding I'm

51
00:03:09,739 --> 00:03:15,590
teaching if more time for research and

52
00:03:13,299 --> 00:03:18,200
having your own funding will mean that

53
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:20,150
you can do the research that you really

54
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:22,539
want to do and you'll be less tied to

55
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:25,639
like your supervisors grant or something

56
00:03:22,539 --> 00:03:30,169
and as Lauren kind of hinted at this was

57
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:32,239
also just great going through the

58
00:03:30,169 --> 00:03:34,638
application process you'll really have

59
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:36,139
to think deeply about your ideas and

60
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:38,540
what you really want to do and that's

61
00:03:36,139 --> 00:03:40,790
just like an awesome thing to do and

62
00:03:38,539 --> 00:04:01,280
will help you out even if you don't end

63
00:03:40,789 --> 00:04:05,840
up getting you know still to hear me

64
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:08,199
like this entry's thank you I appreciate

65
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,200
that

66
00:04:09,729 --> 00:04:12,789
[Music]

67
00:04:19,488 --> 00:04:28,560
improvement improvement yeah all right

68
00:04:25,949 --> 00:04:30,210
well all right so yeah in this workshop

69
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:35,370
we're going to talk specifically about

70
00:04:30,209 --> 00:04:38,638
the National Science Foundation there's

71
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:43,228
about 2000 Awards per year across all of

72
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:47,519
the STEM fields the award provides three

73
00:04:43,228 --> 00:04:49,978
years of stipend at about 34 grand a

74
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:53,038
year and that amount does go up over

75
00:04:49,978 --> 00:04:55,379
time like to adjust for inflation and

76
00:04:53,038 --> 00:04:58,829
all that good stuff and it also provides

77
00:04:55,379 --> 00:05:00,509
tuitions I'm also just going to say

78
00:04:58,829 --> 00:05:02,728
after that to say this before we're

79
00:05:00,509 --> 00:05:04,889
gonna be sending you all of these slides

80
00:05:02,728 --> 00:05:06,990
and in addition to a bunch of extra

81
00:05:04,889 --> 00:05:08,699
resources so don't stress about like

82
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:10,889
writing stuff down right now if you're

83
00:05:08,699 --> 00:05:15,620
welcome to take notes we'll send all of

84
00:05:10,889 --> 00:05:18,629
us and so okay in addition with the GRP

85
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:24,269
there are one of these extra bonus

86
00:05:18,629 --> 00:05:27,779
opportunities that you can get needs to

87
00:05:24,269 --> 00:05:30,418
do government internships land with a

88
00:05:27,779 --> 00:05:36,899
federal agency so those are kind of some

89
00:05:30,418 --> 00:05:39,209
cool extras so with the geography one

90
00:05:36,899 --> 00:05:41,519
thing to keep in mind is that it's

91
00:05:39,209 --> 00:05:45,239
possible to make yourself competitive

92
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:59,879
and contention where you're one of the

93
00:05:45,240 --> 00:06:04,590
top okay so this is our general timeline

94
00:05:59,879 --> 00:06:07,978
overview of how the GRP works so we have

95
00:06:04,589 --> 00:06:11,489
the exact dates for the 2018 award

96
00:06:07,978 --> 00:06:16,259
competition so the application will we

97
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:18,720
do then for some reason to give your

98
00:06:16,259 --> 00:06:21,839
reference letter writers about an extra

99
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:25,380
week then your letters will be due so

100
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:35,669
then who you submit a draft

101
00:06:25,379 --> 00:06:38,589
awesome yes you'll hear back from

102
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:42,189
schools then you'll hear back from the G

103
00:06:38,589 --> 00:06:46,389
RFP before decision deadlines for you

104
00:06:42,189 --> 00:06:48,339
decide and so the things might change a

105
00:06:46,389 --> 00:06:53,279
little bit for the G RFP but it's

106
00:06:48,339 --> 00:06:53,279
generally kind of like this time line

107
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:58,990
also please like raise your hand ask

108
00:06:57,370 --> 00:07:12,399
questions at any point or just shout him

109
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:14,439
out yeah yeah so I'm just gonna repeat

110
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:18,069
that question so the question was about

111
00:07:14,439 --> 00:07:20,529
how does kind of applying for the grant

112
00:07:18,069 --> 00:07:23,649
and they're helping your application and

113
00:07:20,529 --> 00:07:26,949
yeah I think you're right that just

114
00:07:23,649 --> 00:07:29,469
seeing that you're applying later trying

115
00:07:26,949 --> 00:07:31,089
to make that happen it's something that

116
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:37,110
still is like to see and then also

117
00:07:31,089 --> 00:07:39,849
typically when you apply you may contact

118
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:42,189
p.i that you're actually interested in

119
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:44,560
joining their lab and talk to them about

120
00:07:42,189 --> 00:07:46,990
your project idea because you'll end up

121
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:49,629
proposing something that's very specific

122
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:53,050
it could be directed at a specific lab

123
00:07:49,629 --> 00:07:56,469
so that's also a way of showing it

124
00:07:53,050 --> 00:08:02,740
really interested in a place and that

125
00:07:56,470 --> 00:08:08,160
can help okay

126
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:08,160
so fun stuff eligibility and rules so

127
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:15,759
you can apply as many friends as you

128
00:08:13,089 --> 00:08:17,229
like before you start grad schools you

129
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:20,099
can apply when you're a senior an

130
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:22,870
undergrad anytime before you've started

131
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:24,879
grad school if you take a year or two

132
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:28,350
off you can keep applying during that

133
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:30,790
time and then once you're in a program

134
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:31,719
graduate students are limited to one

135
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:33,370
application

136
00:08:31,718 --> 00:08:35,649
and that would be either during the

137
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:43,448
first year or the second year of

138
00:08:35,649 --> 00:08:47,649
graduates and unfortunately if you don't

139
00:08:43,448 --> 00:08:54,549
have US citizenship national Oakland

140
00:08:47,649 --> 00:08:56,799
residents and you also become ineligible

141
00:08:54,549 --> 00:08:59,740
if you've completed your grad or

142
00:08:56,799 --> 00:09:02,799
professional degree by first the year of

143
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:06,129
application but there are exceptions to

144
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:09,399
this and I'm definitely not an expert

145
00:09:06,129 --> 00:09:12,329
about geography eligibility so if you

146
00:09:09,399 --> 00:09:14,620
have questions definitely come ask and

147
00:09:12,328 --> 00:09:17,679
likely what will happen is we can put

148
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:20,049
you in touch with someone who is super

149
00:09:17,679 --> 00:09:23,769
familiar with this at most schools there

150
00:09:20,049 --> 00:09:26,799
is someone who will kind of be the

151
00:09:23,769 --> 00:09:28,509
person who oversees all of the gr FP

152
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:31,198
recipients and they're like a really

153
00:09:28,509 --> 00:09:31,199
good source of information

154
00:09:36,568 --> 00:09:43,269
okay so you've submitted your

155
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:55,209
application and October then woohoo so

156
00:09:43,269 --> 00:09:58,509
now what's gonna happen so I made a

157
00:09:55,208 --> 00:10:01,778
collagen evolutionary biology and my

158
00:09:58,509 --> 00:10:04,269
panel would probably either be ecology

159
00:10:01,778 --> 00:10:07,360
or evolutionary biology so they're super

160
00:10:04,269 --> 00:10:09,610
broad so you know I I studied plant

161
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:11,800
pollinator interactions but the people

162
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:15,159
who read my application could send me a

163
00:10:11,799 --> 00:10:19,389
whole range of topics ecology or

164
00:10:15,159 --> 00:10:23,588
evolutionary biology so those panelists

165
00:10:19,389 --> 00:10:26,620
really might not be super knowledgeable

166
00:10:23,589 --> 00:10:28,300
or well versed in the technicalities of

167
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:31,808
your discipline so that's something to

168
00:10:28,299 --> 00:10:36,338
keep in mind as you're writing and so

169
00:10:31,808 --> 00:10:38,969
the review criteria these two big pieces

170
00:10:36,339 --> 00:10:38,970
that

171
00:10:39,198 --> 00:10:45,269
including intellectual merit and broader

172
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:47,458
context so intellectual merit is

173
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:48,839
basically this idea that your work

174
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:53,278
should have the potential to advance

175
00:10:48,839 --> 00:10:55,259
knowledge either across fields so there

176
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:58,948
should be some kind of like novel aspect

177
00:10:55,259 --> 00:11:02,459
to what you're proposing that will

178
00:10:58,948 --> 00:11:06,288
advance science and then broader impacts

179
00:11:02,458 --> 00:11:09,288
are this idea that NSF wants the work to

180
00:11:06,288 --> 00:11:13,139
have this potential to benefit society

181
00:11:09,288 --> 00:11:16,288
so that could be the research itself

182
00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:19,379
like if you work on something that has a

183
00:11:16,288 --> 00:11:21,538
lot of applications to agriculture or

184
00:11:19,379 --> 00:11:23,908
fighting diseases or things like that

185
00:11:21,538 --> 00:11:26,369
but it also you can also have broader

186
00:11:23,908 --> 00:11:28,769
impacts through activities that are

187
00:11:26,369 --> 00:11:32,489
related to or supported by the research

188
00:11:28,769 --> 00:12:16,698
so if you are involved in some kind of

189
00:11:32,489 --> 00:12:16,699
scientific outreach program way too big

190
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:54,740
the top ticket money so see what I kind

191
00:12:47,149 --> 00:12:57,679
of yes so the question is about you know

192
00:12:54,740 --> 00:13:01,519
how exactly intellectual merit and

193
00:12:57,679 --> 00:13:04,370
broader impacts are scored and yeah the

194
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:09,230
answer is definitely that you need both

195
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:11,330
so if one of them is super high and one

196
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:13,639
of them the reviewers really isn't as

197
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:16,670
great you won't just get the fellowship

198
00:13:13,639 --> 00:13:19,189
because you have great continental merit

199
00:13:16,669 --> 00:13:24,309
or great broader impact you need really

200
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:24,310
to have both of them be well developed

201
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:37,370
ok so here's just a little bit more

202
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:40,039
about what makes a successful

203
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:42,730
application so we've been talking about

204
00:13:40,039 --> 00:13:45,529
intellectual merit and broader impacts

205
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:48,860
the panelists really like to see

206
00:13:45,529 --> 00:13:52,339
creative original or transformative

207
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:55,430
concepts which just even saying that

208
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:57,470
made me nervous because oh my gosh like

209
00:13:55,429 --> 00:14:00,799
how are we supposed to be doing that at

210
00:13:57,470 --> 00:14:03,980
the beginning of our careers but you can

211
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:08,839
do it you just take time to really think

212
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:11,180
about what would push your field and try

213
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:13,730
to propose something that you feel like

214
00:14:11,179 --> 00:14:17,599
it'd be cool to see that anything hasn't

215
00:14:13,730 --> 00:14:20,629
been done before in some way they'd

216
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:22,820
really like to see well reasoned with an

217
00:14:20,629 --> 00:14:25,700
organized basis for activity and a way

218
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:27,350
of assessing success so think we'll talk

219
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:30,379
about this more later but that comes

220
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:33,649
from having clear hypotheses that you

221
00:14:30,379 --> 00:14:36,679
can test with your project so they

222
00:14:33,649 --> 00:14:40,429
really like to see it a focus project

223
00:14:36,679 --> 00:14:42,529
that is clear and it seems like you can

224
00:14:40,429 --> 00:14:47,299
do it and you'll really learn something

225
00:14:42,529 --> 00:14:50,720
from doing it so another thing that

226
00:14:47,299 --> 00:14:52,189
matters are the qualifications of the

227
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,560
individual and

228
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:58,190
the organization for the activities so

229
00:14:54,559 --> 00:15:01,578
it can be tricky if you're proposing to

230
00:14:58,190 --> 00:15:03,829
move into an area of research you really

231
00:15:01,578 --> 00:15:05,388
haven't worked in before so it helps

232
00:15:03,828 --> 00:15:08,169
with this to kind of play to your

233
00:15:05,389 --> 00:15:11,419
strengths like I've already worked with

234
00:15:08,169 --> 00:15:14,208
this kind of system before so that would

235
00:15:11,419 --> 00:15:16,128
help me do this project or the lab that

236
00:15:14,208 --> 00:15:18,979
I'm joining has worked in this system

237
00:15:16,129 --> 00:15:21,560
for a long time so that will help me I

238
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:23,329
don't do this project and then kind of

239
00:15:21,559 --> 00:15:25,099
building off of that they're also

240
00:15:23,328 --> 00:15:27,739
looking for you know do you have

241
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:30,379
adequate resources and support at an

242
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:33,110
institution or through collaboration so

243
00:15:30,379 --> 00:15:35,449
again like does it make sense that you

244
00:15:33,110 --> 00:16:02,180
can do the project based on who else

245
00:15:35,448 --> 00:16:04,399
you're working with and what yeah so the

246
00:16:02,179 --> 00:16:07,489
question is kind of about like who your

247
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:09,409
collaborators can be and yeah there was

248
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:11,899
not necessarily always working with an

249
00:16:09,409 --> 00:16:14,929
academic institution can that kind of

250
00:16:11,899 --> 00:16:21,350
work towards this and I think yes it can

251
00:16:14,929 --> 00:16:24,620
I will say that yes so being affiliated

252
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:26,629
with an institution is sort of essential

253
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:30,528
on some level because you are applying

254
00:16:26,629 --> 00:16:33,649
to go to grad school and getting a PhD

255
00:16:30,528 --> 00:16:35,509
you know typically it involves being

256
00:16:33,649 --> 00:16:37,519
affiliated with the university all other

257
00:16:35,509 --> 00:16:39,889
arcs and programs will be joining with

258
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:42,438
like conservation organisations and

259
00:16:39,889 --> 00:16:44,948
things like that so I think yeah you

260
00:16:42,438 --> 00:16:48,019
want to stress that you're going to be

261
00:16:44,948 --> 00:16:50,750
in a certain lab or in a certain

262
00:16:48,019 --> 00:16:53,870
graduate program but then if you know

263
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:55,850
that you have those connections to say

264
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:58,068
agencies or conservation groups or

265
00:16:55,850 --> 00:17:00,149
something like that already that can be

266
00:16:58,068 --> 00:17:03,198
really great

267
00:17:00,149 --> 00:17:05,669
I just wouldn't rely solely on

268
00:17:03,198 --> 00:17:16,529
non-academic collaborations or

269
00:17:05,669 --> 00:17:19,829
connections so that's a great question

270
00:17:16,529 --> 00:17:28,889
so the question is how specific should

271
00:17:19,828 --> 00:17:32,519
your connection be to a specific lands

272
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:36,330
produced specific so you will write this

273
00:17:32,519 --> 00:17:38,220
proposal as if you have decided and you

274
00:17:36,329 --> 00:17:41,879
are going to work with a specific

275
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:44,850
professor out of specific place and if

276
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:48,929
you don't end up doing that that's fine

277
00:17:44,849 --> 00:17:51,119
but you just kind of pretend in some

278
00:17:48,929 --> 00:17:54,630
ways that that's what you're going to do

279
00:17:51,119 --> 00:17:59,668
so it's also it also could be the case

280
00:17:54,630 --> 00:18:01,500
that as you're applying you say oh I can

281
00:17:59,669 --> 00:18:02,429
work with this person at this place to

282
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,808
do this project

283
00:18:02,429 --> 00:18:06,360
and you may even be sharing that

284
00:18:03,808 --> 00:18:08,190
application with other pies we're not

285
00:18:06,359 --> 00:18:11,298
the person that you named but that's

286
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:16,590
okay you just kind of want that

287
00:18:11,298 --> 00:18:20,730
placeholder in - yeah show that you have

288
00:18:16,589 --> 00:18:22,439
something really specific in mind when I

289
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:24,808
was applying every touch professor that

290
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:27,210
I wanted to work with this is kind of my

291
00:18:24,808 --> 00:18:32,190
interest area do you have to clean this

292
00:18:27,210 --> 00:19:03,150
or can we do something together like I

293
00:18:32,190 --> 00:19:05,490
wrote up and it was very much yep so the

294
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:08,909
question is obviously I'm telling you to

295
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:11,519
be specific and pick one person one

296
00:19:08,909 --> 00:19:14,580
tailoring your application to what

297
00:19:11,519 --> 00:19:15,749
happens if that's not where you go or

298
00:19:14,579 --> 00:19:17,460
you don't get in there or something

299
00:19:15,749 --> 00:19:20,819
that's totally fine

300
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:25,528
so no one holds you to what you rank in

301
00:19:20,819 --> 00:19:27,689
here it's fine and we'll get into this a

302
00:19:25,528 --> 00:19:32,220
little bit more but part of the

303
00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:35,249
geography is kind of just seeing how

304
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:37,679
well a little can develop a project and

305
00:19:35,249 --> 00:19:40,259
write about it and it's like how the

306
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:45,149
fundament that panelists are that you

307
00:19:40,259 --> 00:19:46,769
can do science on this level as an

308
00:19:45,148 --> 00:19:48,928
early-stage grad student

309
00:19:46,769 --> 00:19:53,009
so yeah whether or not you actually

310
00:19:48,929 --> 00:19:55,879
pursue that project it really doesn't

311
00:19:53,009 --> 00:19:55,878
matter one way or the other

312
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:09,108
yes so the question is about how early

313
00:20:06,569 --> 00:20:11,368
we start contacting people and I'm gonna

314
00:20:09,108 --> 00:20:13,618
pull up on answering that because we are

315
00:20:11,368 --> 00:20:16,888
gonna get to that in a minute so any

316
00:20:13,618 --> 00:20:28,918
other questions about this stuff like a

317
00:20:16,888 --> 00:20:30,839
very big picture just make it totally

318
00:20:28,919 --> 00:20:33,538
Fanta and it's the funding follows you

319
00:20:30,839 --> 00:20:51,918
anywhere yes like it's time to you not

320
00:20:33,538 --> 00:20:51,919
to institution yes so holistic review

321
00:20:53,269 --> 00:21:00,659
okay this line is going to be a disaster

322
00:20:56,749 --> 00:21:08,069
but I'll walk you through it so this is

323
00:21:00,659 --> 00:21:11,220
all about basically given this timeline

324
00:21:08,069 --> 00:21:13,099
that we've already outlined for the G

325
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:15,720
RFP

326
00:21:13,099 --> 00:21:17,819
yeah you're gonna want to start coming

327
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:21,799
up with your ideas for projects in the

328
00:21:17,819 --> 00:21:23,730
summer and early fall and I think that

329
00:21:21,799 --> 00:21:26,460
really getting into the writing

330
00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:28,710
contacting professors is something that

331
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:30,870
you want to start kind of with for this

332
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:33,569
year starts and September so like

333
00:21:30,869 --> 00:21:36,239
mid-august I think it's often a really

334
00:21:33,569 --> 00:21:38,399
great time and if you do it super early

335
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:40,589
it's possible that people are doing

336
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:44,370
field work or they're just kind of not

337
00:21:40,589 --> 00:21:46,379
on email fully and you might get lost if

338
00:21:44,369 --> 00:21:50,250
you do it too late people are already

339
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:52,170
super busy with the semester so once

340
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:54,660
you've started thinking about your ideas

341
00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:59,279
you want to contact potential key eyes

342
00:21:54,660 --> 00:22:01,740
with a written project idea and then let

343
00:21:59,279 --> 00:22:03,359
them know or as you would talk back and

344
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:07,640
forth more than later you're going to

345
00:22:03,359 --> 00:22:07,639
want to follow up with a full draft

346
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:23,700
yep so the question is would even the

347
00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:28,170
chance question about the G RFP upgrade

348
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:31,200
in your first full female professor and

349
00:22:28,170 --> 00:22:35,220
I think that's totally fine yeah I think

350
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:37,950
it's great to say hey you know this is

351
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:40,410
who I am and what I'm hoping to do you

352
00:22:37,950 --> 00:22:43,650
know you're attaching your CV to that

353
00:22:40,410 --> 00:22:47,220
and then you can also say and then

354
00:22:43,650 --> 00:22:49,500
working on a G RFP application like is

355
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:51,650
that something that I can talk to you

356
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:56,849
more about you just have go from there

357
00:22:51,650 --> 00:22:58,950
so as you're starting this process we

358
00:22:56,849 --> 00:23:00,829
want to highlight the resources that

359
00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:04,019
you're going to have so you have

360
00:23:00,829 --> 00:23:05,970
professors that you can talk to you both

361
00:23:04,019 --> 00:23:07,710
may be our current professors if you're

362
00:23:05,970 --> 00:23:11,490
still in school or the professors that

363
00:23:07,710 --> 00:23:13,470
you have when you're an undergrad you

364
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:16,650
can talk to you with graduate students

365
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:19,009
so we are all here to help either this

366
00:23:16,650 --> 00:23:21,680
fall or in the future I

367
00:23:19,009 --> 00:23:23,390
and also talk to the Brad students at

368
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:26,860
some of the institutions that are going

369
00:23:23,390 --> 00:23:29,630
to you or that you're applying to people

370
00:23:26,859 --> 00:23:32,929
interested in hey did you apply for the

371
00:23:29,630 --> 00:23:36,620
G RFP would you maybe be willing to look

372
00:23:32,930 --> 00:23:39,980
at my materials and then there's lots of

373
00:23:36,619 --> 00:23:42,229
other sources for writing support so for

374
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:44,809
those of you who are still in school I

375
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:47,450
know a lot of schools like writing

376
00:23:44,809 --> 00:23:49,339
centers that you can go to and bring you

377
00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:54,590
know drafts of your work and those can

378
00:23:49,339 --> 00:23:56,750
be great for this so yeah at the bottom

379
00:23:54,589 --> 00:24:02,899
of this slide it's okay to ask someone

380
00:23:56,750 --> 00:24:04,670
to read the work so I can't stress don't

381
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:08,720
feel like you have to work on this in a

382
00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:11,029
vacuum by ourselves you should get as

383
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:14,240
many people as you can to read your work

384
00:24:11,029 --> 00:24:15,920
and give you feedback it's still going

385
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:18,440
to end up being your work but at the end

386
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:22,450
of the day but putting yourself out

387
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:22,450
there to get feedback is really good

388
00:24:28,690 --> 00:24:33,880
do you have any other questions up to

389
00:24:31,009 --> 00:24:37,970
that point it's a lot of information

390
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:40,340
alright then we'll keep rolling so we're

391
00:24:37,970 --> 00:24:42,529
talk about some of the details of the

392
00:24:40,339 --> 00:24:45,019
proposal itself so in this you need to

393
00:24:42,529 --> 00:24:47,299
have two statements one as a research

394
00:24:45,019 --> 00:24:49,309
statement and this is two pages which

395
00:24:47,299 --> 00:24:51,109
it's not a lot of space to say

396
00:24:49,309 --> 00:24:53,599
everything you do say about a research

397
00:24:51,109 --> 00:24:55,639
project and then a personal statement

398
00:24:53,599 --> 00:24:58,250
any of three pages for that range of

399
00:24:55,640 --> 00:25:00,259
relevant forms and any of your future

400
00:24:58,250 --> 00:25:02,299
goals and these statements we've

401
00:25:00,259 --> 00:25:03,980
presented to your viewers in the same

402
00:25:02,299 --> 00:25:06,649
packet and they should be kind of

403
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:08,630
related so bring them seriously you love

404
00:25:06,650 --> 00:25:10,460
dolphins don't talk about microbes in

405
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:12,140
your personal statement like dolphins in

406
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:14,299
your research statement have some

407
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:16,250
cohesive flow between them and we're

408
00:25:14,299 --> 00:25:19,000
talking about a few more examples of

409
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:22,140
those yes

410
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,140
[Music]

411
00:25:30,138 --> 00:25:34,558
so the question was how much is research

412
00:25:32,819 --> 00:25:37,618
you've already done way into whether or

413
00:25:34,558 --> 00:25:39,719
not you'll you're accepted being

414
00:25:37,618 --> 00:25:41,908
accepted for this fellowship I think it

415
00:25:39,719 --> 00:25:43,710
certainly helps to have say that you

416
00:25:41,909 --> 00:25:44,460
have this experience I think for a

417
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:45,960
couple of reasons

418
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:48,808
so first you'll be able to talk about it

419
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:50,340
a little bit more comfortable way so you

420
00:25:48,808 --> 00:25:51,749
kind of notes in the language and notes

421
00:25:50,339 --> 00:25:53,699
in the techniques already you'll be

422
00:25:51,749 --> 00:25:55,950
learning something new to write this

423
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:58,979
proposal and I think also you'll be able

424
00:25:55,950 --> 00:26:00,288
to demonstrate that you're also capable

425
00:25:58,979 --> 00:26:03,210
of doing this proposal it might just

426
00:26:00,288 --> 00:26:06,269
sound a lot more feasible to the

427
00:26:03,210 --> 00:26:08,429
reviewers if that is what you're

428
00:26:06,269 --> 00:26:10,048
proposing and you can talk about that

429
00:26:08,429 --> 00:26:12,389
also in your personal statement to you

430
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:14,598
so they'll be of something that you've

431
00:26:12,388 --> 00:26:14,598
done

432
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:25,940
[Music]

433
00:26:45,109 --> 00:26:48,209
[Music]

434
00:26:52,769 --> 00:26:56,170
[Music]

435
00:27:02,769 --> 00:27:06,139
[Laughter]

436
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:26,618
[Music]

437
00:27:33,079 --> 00:27:36,798
the question is on single states are

438
00:27:35,450 --> 00:27:38,419
double-spaced these are single spaced

439
00:27:36,798 --> 00:27:42,950
and we're going to go over some of the

440
00:27:38,419 --> 00:27:48,710
little formatting later all right

441
00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:50,749
any more questions all right oh and

442
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:52,369
speaking of the personal statement the

443
00:27:50,749 --> 00:27:56,058
next workshop we're reviewing personal

444
00:27:52,368 --> 00:27:57,038
statements so there'll be some great

445
00:27:56,058 --> 00:28:00,888
time soon

446
00:27:57,038 --> 00:28:02,868
all right the other part of your

447
00:28:00,888 --> 00:28:04,638
application are three recommendation

448
00:28:02,868 --> 00:28:06,858
letters and they shouldn't be some

449
00:28:04,638 --> 00:28:08,238
people who know your motivations and

450
00:28:06,858 --> 00:28:11,358
here you can trust to write a really

451
00:28:08,239 --> 00:28:12,769
excellent it's really helpful thing come

452
00:28:11,358 --> 00:28:14,960
from different points or different

453
00:28:12,769 --> 00:28:17,210
aspects of your life and undergrads so

454
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:19,190
for instance maybe a professor you've

455
00:28:17,210 --> 00:28:23,239
worked for or someone who's your advisor

456
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:25,909
or maybe someone who is in a non

457
00:28:23,239 --> 00:28:27,769
research related job that you're in so

458
00:28:25,909 --> 00:28:29,299
for instance my reference letters for

459
00:28:27,769 --> 00:28:30,919
two professors and I worked in a

460
00:28:29,298 --> 00:28:35,089
tutoring center so is the director of

461
00:28:30,919 --> 00:28:36,710
the two books that Arthur and me also on

462
00:28:35,089 --> 00:28:39,858
make sure they can all speak to your

463
00:28:36,710 --> 00:28:41,840
ability to do graduate research and so

464
00:28:39,858 --> 00:28:44,148
some of this is helping them do that so

465
00:28:41,839 --> 00:28:46,339
writing letters for quite a few students

466
00:28:44,148 --> 00:28:48,168
do you want to share them your CV

467
00:28:46,339 --> 00:28:51,558
sheriff in the statements you're sending

468
00:28:48,169 --> 00:28:53,419
to the NSF and also share any review

469
00:28:51,558 --> 00:28:55,038
criteria or ease you want them to

470
00:28:53,419 --> 00:28:57,288
highlight and make it really easy for

471
00:28:55,038 --> 00:28:59,358
them to write an excellent letter this

472
00:28:57,288 --> 00:29:01,190
is what the NSF wants to hear here's

473
00:28:59,358 --> 00:29:02,658
some things that I've done please put

474
00:29:01,190 --> 00:29:04,220
this into a nice letter it's totally

475
00:29:02,659 --> 00:29:19,820
fine to ask for that and give them that

476
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:21,889
guidance yeah yeah so the comment was

477
00:29:19,819 --> 00:29:26,089
I'm writing like a skeleton letter for

478
00:29:21,888 --> 00:29:28,608
your advisor I think yeah that's a good

479
00:29:26,089 --> 00:29:30,288
advice I think depending on your

480
00:29:28,608 --> 00:29:33,079
relationship with your advisor may be

481
00:29:30,288 --> 00:29:35,599
like having sentences for them might

482
00:29:33,079 --> 00:29:37,399
it's too far but I would certainly at

483
00:29:35,599 --> 00:29:40,730
least like bullet points like here's the

484
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:42,050
criteria here's my cpu and if you could

485
00:29:40,730 --> 00:29:45,829
please make sure you talk about this

486
00:29:42,049 --> 00:29:47,389
experience that is I don't know I mean

487
00:29:45,829 --> 00:29:50,629
stepping on their toes or maybe making

488
00:29:47,390 --> 00:29:53,090
them feel a little bit too much but

489
00:29:50,630 --> 00:29:56,420
again it depends on you know how you

490
00:29:53,089 --> 00:29:58,789
know them all right so you've been

491
00:29:56,420 --> 00:30:02,350
talking a lot about this and we're gonna

492
00:29:58,789 --> 00:30:07,309
send you about five ones that were

493
00:30:02,349 --> 00:30:09,619
successful application and so there's

494
00:30:07,309 --> 00:30:11,839
four of them that are from Phoebe and

495
00:30:09,619 --> 00:30:20,199
those are the first four titles and to

496
00:30:11,839 --> 00:30:20,199
them are successful ones too so you can

497
00:30:21,190 --> 00:30:25,309
yeah and just one thing to keep in mind

498
00:30:23,690 --> 00:30:28,519
while reading these these were all from

499
00:30:25,309 --> 00:30:30,649
different years and some other rules

500
00:30:28,519 --> 00:30:33,049
might have changed if you see some

501
00:30:30,650 --> 00:30:34,370
anisette website this is do this and you

502
00:30:33,049 --> 00:30:36,619
see something else in this statement

503
00:30:34,369 --> 00:30:39,500
although it's on the NSF website don't

504
00:30:36,619 --> 00:30:42,619
look to the aside as an example that you

505
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:44,720
must follow but they're all really great

506
00:30:42,619 --> 00:30:46,429
because they deal with presenting

507
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:48,680
intellectual merit and broader impacts

508
00:30:46,430 --> 00:30:50,630
of different ways some people have in

509
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:53,210
the research and personal statement you

510
00:30:50,630 --> 00:30:55,640
know a bold title is in Auto Maris and a

511
00:30:53,210 --> 00:30:57,410
bold title of broader impacts others are

512
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:58,759
more integrated throughout you can see a

513
00:30:57,410 --> 00:31:01,970
bunch of different examples of how

514
00:30:58,759 --> 00:31:04,039
people kind of tackle this and yeah

515
00:31:01,970 --> 00:31:06,559
they're really great so read through

516
00:31:04,039 --> 00:31:08,089
also we mentioned earlier connecting the

517
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:10,009
research statement to the personal

518
00:31:08,089 --> 00:31:12,529
statement you'll see on some of the of

519
00:31:10,009 --> 00:31:13,430
how people have done that and we're

520
00:31:12,529 --> 00:31:15,910
going to talk about that a little bit

521
00:31:13,430 --> 00:31:15,910
more too

522
00:31:29,829 --> 00:31:32,970
[Music]

523
00:31:35,549 --> 00:31:38,680
[Music]

524
00:31:55,859 --> 00:32:00,159
the questions will receive personal

525
00:31:58,329 --> 00:32:01,779
statements - and the answer is yes so we

526
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:03,910
have research and personal statements

527
00:32:01,779 --> 00:32:05,289
some of them some grad students were

528
00:32:03,910 --> 00:32:06,250
only willing to share ones you might

529
00:32:05,289 --> 00:32:09,579
have one that it's not a complete

530
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:11,410
application but there are at least four

531
00:32:09,579 --> 00:32:22,210
more complete applications that will

532
00:32:11,410 --> 00:32:24,269
give you so all right and then the

533
00:32:22,210 --> 00:32:28,600
formatting rules you have to follow them

534
00:32:24,269 --> 00:32:30,519
there's no you don't form any grants for

535
00:32:28,599 --> 00:32:31,899
this application others if the rules are

536
00:32:30,519 --> 00:32:33,700
followed they will not review your

537
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:37,690
application so please take them

538
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:42,910
seriously and don't be like 11.75 it's

539
00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:45,549
gonna fit like don't hire me paper of

540
00:32:42,910 --> 00:32:48,430
one-inch margin and you can use Times

541
00:32:45,549 --> 00:32:50,710
New Roman or a last type of font but you

542
00:32:48,430 --> 00:32:53,799
can use 10-point font for references and

543
00:32:50,710 --> 00:32:56,410
for your legends and again it's single

544
00:32:53,799 --> 00:32:58,119
spaced and it's two pages maximum and

545
00:32:56,410 --> 00:33:01,210
that's including everything you want to

546
00:32:58,119 --> 00:33:02,949
put in for the research statement it's

547
00:33:01,210 --> 00:33:04,509
two pages next month and that includes

548
00:33:02,950 --> 00:33:21,490
everything you want to put it in that

549
00:33:04,509 --> 00:33:24,099
research statement for the question was

550
00:33:21,490 --> 00:33:26,559
is that one experimenters and multiple

551
00:33:24,099 --> 00:33:29,919
experiments in one so in general it's

552
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:34,809
one experiment of a couple hypotheses or

553
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:36,279
objectives so for instance in one of and

554
00:33:34,809 --> 00:33:38,679
it's some of these statements just the

555
00:33:36,279 --> 00:33:40,269
it's like no work of mycorrhizae fungi

556
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:41,830
and it's characterizing different

557
00:33:40,269 --> 00:33:45,009
metabolites or something about the

558
00:33:41,829 --> 00:33:47,629
genetic control of micro eyes little

559
00:33:45,009 --> 00:34:49,730
attachment to plan

560
00:33:47,630 --> 00:34:49,730
two or three yeah how much research -

561
00:34:54,389 --> 00:34:57,459
[Music]

562
00:35:05,449 --> 00:35:09,989
all right so uniform anything make sure

563
00:35:08,070 --> 00:35:11,789
you take full advantage of the space

564
00:35:09,989 --> 00:35:13,349
most people will fill up the whole two

565
00:35:11,789 --> 00:35:14,940
pages for the research statement and the

566
00:35:13,349 --> 00:35:18,029
full three pages for the personal

567
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:19,769
statements and then also don't forget

568
00:35:18,030 --> 00:35:21,540
that you can use things like bold or

569
00:35:19,769 --> 00:35:23,309
italic so maybe some people will put

570
00:35:21,539 --> 00:35:24,929
their main hypotheses their objectives

571
00:35:23,309 --> 00:35:27,119
in full just to draw the reader's

572
00:35:24,929 --> 00:35:28,649
attention so this is the main idea of

573
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:31,230
this paragraph and the main idea the

574
00:35:28,650 --> 00:35:33,480
next paragraph and then there's a

575
00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:35,670
certain citation style it's the citation

576
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:37,710
style use and nature or science papers

577
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:41,760
and it's how many of you have used a

578
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:43,559
citation manager before let's I did in

579
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:46,890
an undergrad zone very happy to see that

580
00:35:43,559 --> 00:35:48,960
so if you are a citation manager it's

581
00:35:46,889 --> 00:35:51,089
three different software's like there's

582
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:54,210
some free ones like mentally or endnotes

583
00:35:51,090 --> 00:35:56,050
I think are the two big ones and what it

584
00:35:54,210 --> 00:35:57,610
is is you can upload

585
00:35:56,050 --> 00:36:00,820
various papers you've read to this

586
00:35:57,610 --> 00:36:02,470
manager and then through Microsoft Word

587
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:05,200
or whatever WordPress that you're using

588
00:36:02,469 --> 00:36:08,500
you can insert citations through there

589
00:36:05,199 --> 00:36:10,779
and then it'll build a references list

590
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:13,150
for you in the citation that you talk to

591
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:15,340
and we're not going to talk about how to

592
00:36:13,150 --> 00:36:16,840
use this here but your library resource

593
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:20,850
that your undergrad certainly know how

594
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:20,850
to use those in a definite set you up

595
00:36:21,389 --> 00:36:26,529
and for the future to make sure you

596
00:36:23,679 --> 00:36:30,789
don't make a mistake in this citation

597
00:36:26,530 --> 00:36:32,890
style and then you can't have figures or

598
00:36:30,789 --> 00:36:34,659
images and that's proposal and if you

599
00:36:32,889 --> 00:36:36,969
have a graph or something that can save

600
00:36:34,659 --> 00:36:39,579
you four sentences and what you try to

601
00:36:36,969 --> 00:36:41,109
explain it's really excellent and don't

602
00:36:39,579 --> 00:36:43,569
forget these panelists are reading so

603
00:36:41,110 --> 00:36:45,070
many movies that you can have a nice

604
00:36:43,570 --> 00:36:47,860
figure graph that's going to make your

605
00:36:45,070 --> 00:37:04,990
stand out a little bit too in all the

606
00:36:47,860 --> 00:37:06,370
words they're reading yeah totally so

607
00:37:04,989 --> 00:37:09,279
the question what's a good-sized stare

608
00:37:06,369 --> 00:37:10,869
figure and I think pretty small so if

609
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:17,170
you can have something that you can fit

610
00:37:10,869 --> 00:37:18,880
into hi like maybe 1/2 inch by 1/2 do

611
00:37:17,170 --> 00:37:21,639
something that fits small and if you

612
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:37,300
know you can't make it work then you try

613
00:37:21,639 --> 00:37:38,920
it out hmm yeah it's true so the

614
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:39,940
question is if it's really gonna save

615
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:42,340
you word since you need to have a

616
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:44,710
caption - so the captions can be a

617
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:47,620
10-point font so I could save you a

618
00:37:44,710 --> 00:37:49,599
little bit of space and often you don't

619
00:37:47,619 --> 00:37:51,940
need to necessarily repeat everything

620
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:54,279
that's in the graph you can you know if

621
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:56,769
you're showing I graph of like plant

622
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:58,720
growth - like nitrogen you can say

623
00:37:56,769 --> 00:38:01,659
something brought about the trend versus

624
00:37:58,719 --> 00:38:04,239
like specifically like these four plants

625
00:38:01,659 --> 00:38:07,960
had higher growth her nitrogen input

626
00:38:04,239 --> 00:38:11,139
than these plants see and say something

627
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:14,050
they were important talking the insane I

628
00:38:11,139 --> 00:38:16,449
like there's a differential plant growth

629
00:38:14,050 --> 00:38:19,630
based on nitrogen accumulation figure

630
00:38:16,449 --> 00:38:21,069
one and that's a shorter sentence and I

631
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:22,599
think that if you go like a Writing

632
00:38:21,070 --> 00:38:26,710
Center to of some of this they will also

633
00:38:22,599 --> 00:39:32,140
be able to help make the most of your

634
00:38:26,710 --> 00:39:34,088
using and I don't know about like ax

635
00:39:32,139 --> 00:39:36,509
these legends of those can go below ten

636
00:39:34,088 --> 00:39:36,509
points

637
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:57,559
[Applause]

638
00:39:50,969 --> 00:39:57,559
[Music]

639
00:40:25,159 --> 00:40:30,719
all right so for the writing aspect

640
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:32,580
again you really do need to be specific

641
00:40:30,719 --> 00:40:34,379
so stating your hypotheses and

642
00:40:32,579 --> 00:40:37,769
objectives really clearly and how you

643
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:40,079
will test them is really important in a

644
00:40:37,769 --> 00:40:42,300
research statement there's it has to

645
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:44,940
happen and Aurora and hex are also

646
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:47,610
important so Andy wants to relate those

647
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:50,789
both in your personal statement and your

648
00:40:47,610 --> 00:40:52,950
research statement by excelling a link

649
00:40:50,789 --> 00:40:56,670
through those they have a quick example

650
00:40:52,949 --> 00:40:58,529
so for instance some of the proposals

651
00:40:56,670 --> 00:40:59,970
that will share with you at the end of

652
00:40:58,530 --> 00:41:09,480
the research statement or maybe some

653
00:40:59,969 --> 00:41:11,759
other students by involving students in

654
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:14,070
summer research through fellowship on

655
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:17,460
this aspect of the project so you're

656
00:41:14,070 --> 00:41:20,460
tying in different tutoring and want to

657
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:21,929
bring that into your a research

658
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:23,699
statement that's how you would do that

659
00:41:21,929 --> 00:41:30,869
and again you'll see some examples of

660
00:41:23,699 --> 00:41:32,879
those later alright and there's a lot of

661
00:41:30,869 --> 00:41:35,069
resources to help you out with this so

662
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:37,769
like he said we're sharing these finds

663
00:41:35,070 --> 00:41:40,260
of you are sharing a bunch of a bunch of

664
00:41:37,769 --> 00:41:42,179
applications with you there's also a lot

665
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:48,270
of databases though that we're not

666
00:41:42,179 --> 00:41:50,129
Michigan the NSF website has all of the

667
00:41:48,269 --> 00:41:51,960
guidelines that we've kind of talked

668
00:41:50,130 --> 00:41:54,329
through in more there's these important

669
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:56,970
who we've mentioned there's the couple

670
00:41:54,329 --> 00:41:59,279
there's a Twitter link - and don't

671
00:41:56,969 --> 00:42:02,909
forget to ask your pis other grad since

672
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:05,240
you've worked with the applied yeah and

673
00:42:02,909 --> 00:42:05,239
we're sharing

674
00:42:11,590 --> 00:42:18,659
[Applause]

675
00:42:32,869 --> 00:42:40,320
yes the question is how much longer will

676
00:42:35,639 --> 00:42:45,000
the NSF have er the'res if we both hope

677
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:46,619
a long time I don't know when the like

678
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:50,239
funding cycle is but they're definitely

679
00:42:46,619 --> 00:42:52,440
heavy it this year yep so the 2018

680
00:42:50,239 --> 00:43:12,629
competition I would say is almost

681
00:42:52,440 --> 00:43:16,079
certainly going to happen for three

682
00:43:12,630 --> 00:43:19,260
years so 2019 is a little bit more

683
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:22,739
unknown but I'd say 2018 is pretty

684
00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:25,950
likely I really hope that this program

685
00:43:22,739 --> 00:43:28,699
will continue I think it's been really

686
00:43:25,949 --> 00:43:31,789
successful and it's hard to imagine that

687
00:43:28,699 --> 00:43:35,639
cutting it it's in a different it's

688
00:43:31,789 --> 00:43:37,139
staffed in a different way from another

689
00:43:35,639 --> 00:43:41,219
program that they did

690
00:43:37,139 --> 00:43:42,569
- effects graduate students so because

691
00:43:41,219 --> 00:43:45,299
of that I'm kind of hopeful that this

692
00:43:42,570 --> 00:43:49,619
will stick around but I guess with that

693
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:54,560
being said it's a great reason to apply

694
00:43:49,619 --> 00:43:54,559
this coming year like if you think that

695
00:43:54,588 --> 00:44:14,009
interested you know don't we so the

696
00:44:11,070 --> 00:44:17,119
question is if the program were to be

697
00:44:14,010 --> 00:44:20,509
terminated in the future would you still

698
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:23,390
three years of funding and that is a

699
00:44:20,509 --> 00:44:26,480
scary hypothetical that I don't know for

700
00:44:23,389 --> 00:44:30,170
sure but I imagine that you would still

701
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:33,469
get the funding because the program that

702
00:44:30,170 --> 00:44:35,900
the NSF recently cancelled that was

703
00:44:33,469 --> 00:44:38,118
another program for graduate students is

704
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:41,930
called the doctoral dissertation

705
00:44:38,119 --> 00:44:44,930
Improvement Act and I know that people

706
00:44:41,929 --> 00:44:47,778
who got those before it's canceled

707
00:44:44,929 --> 00:44:50,989
they're still getting funding so even if

708
00:44:47,778 --> 00:45:24,018
they hadn't spent it all canceled faster

709
00:44:50,989 --> 00:45:26,959
available and so I think so the

710
00:45:24,018 --> 00:45:29,659
questions about a database for other

711
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:33,798
grants you can apply to before you're in

712
00:45:29,659 --> 00:45:36,558
grad school and I can't say that I know

713
00:45:33,798 --> 00:45:38,719
for sure but I think that there are

714
00:45:36,559 --> 00:45:42,079
resources out there and we will ask

715
00:45:38,719 --> 00:45:45,738
around and try to find those for you

716
00:45:42,079 --> 00:45:49,009
also I know my department maintains a

717
00:45:45,739 --> 00:45:52,940
list of grants and fellowships but the

718
00:45:49,009 --> 00:45:55,219
vast majority of it was for students who

719
00:45:52,940 --> 00:45:56,900
are already in a program so I think in

720
00:45:55,219 --> 00:45:59,480
the geography at this point is a little

721
00:45:56,900 --> 00:46:02,900
bit special in this respect how you can

722
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:05,239
apply for as if incoming student the EPA

723
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:08,720
needs to have a similar fellowship that

724
00:46:05,239 --> 00:46:11,690
program has been discontinued I'm not

725
00:46:08,719 --> 00:46:15,118
sure about like do any Department of

726
00:46:11,690 --> 00:46:17,579
Energy if they have anything like this

727
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:20,729
I don't know about the DOI now for the

728
00:46:17,579 --> 00:46:22,798
USDA it's all after wandering in a

729
00:46:20,728 --> 00:46:25,768
program there aren't any create programs

730
00:46:22,798 --> 00:47:23,869
through the USDA but that's a great

731
00:46:25,768 --> 00:47:28,228
question what if your research is more

732
00:47:23,869 --> 00:47:29,809
research basic research where the goals

733
00:47:28,228 --> 00:47:32,338
are really generating new knowledge

734
00:47:29,809 --> 00:47:35,789
versus like applied research where

735
00:47:32,338 --> 00:47:52,219
you're solving a problem like disease or

736
00:47:35,789 --> 00:47:52,219
something broader impacts really focus

737
00:47:55,278 --> 00:48:06,900
and in addition to me that was talking

738
00:48:03,088 --> 00:48:12,358
about doing how I returned to these the

739
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:17,789
high school in being involved in a

740
00:48:12,358 --> 00:48:19,170
couple of different programs so yeah I

741
00:48:17,789 --> 00:48:22,079
think you better

742
00:48:19,170 --> 00:48:27,950
this from statements but you can really

743
00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:30,510
knock things that lack spirit feel world

744
00:48:27,949 --> 00:48:36,149
kind of music other activities that we

745
00:48:30,510 --> 00:48:38,940
do and I think jackets I worked in a

746
00:48:36,150 --> 00:48:40,920
very applied field and the ms.fer paid

747
00:48:38,940 --> 00:48:42,780
tends to steer more towards basic

748
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:44,670
science or poses so they wanna see I had

749
00:48:42,780 --> 00:48:46,950
classes that you're testing and how

750
00:48:44,670 --> 00:48:48,510
you're going to test it so for a lot of

751
00:48:46,949 --> 00:48:50,129
us if we did think I kinda wanna try

752
00:48:48,510 --> 00:48:52,109
this on a farm and see how it works

753
00:48:50,130 --> 00:48:54,838
that doesn't really even that does have

754
00:48:52,108 --> 00:48:56,818
a parodic impact doesn't really cut it

755
00:48:54,838 --> 00:48:59,400
as the main core of the research

756
00:48:56,818 --> 00:49:01,079
proposal for the G RFP so it meets some

757
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:03,358
aspected like finding out a genetic

758
00:49:01,079 --> 00:49:05,010
mechanism and then your broader impacts

759
00:49:03,358 --> 00:49:06,690
you know saying that through this

760
00:49:05,010 --> 00:49:28,380
genetic mechanism may be a good health

761
00:49:06,690 --> 00:49:30,389
snap reading or something like a I think

762
00:49:28,380 --> 00:49:33,119
for the the research card the broader

763
00:49:30,389 --> 00:49:35,519
impacts that can be a more society note

764
00:49:33,119 --> 00:49:36,900
ask but for the other like average

765
00:49:35,519 --> 00:49:38,940
woman's that Kate was too much about

766
00:49:36,900 --> 00:49:42,269
that can be a sign know that has to be a

767
00:49:38,940 --> 00:49:58,849
more of a central part of your broader

768
00:49:42,269 --> 00:49:58,849
impacts so they really want to know

769
00:50:10,550 --> 00:50:13,639
[Music]

770
00:50:29,298 --> 00:50:33,449
totally I'm building up that too

771
00:50:31,409 --> 00:50:35,038
especially being talked about an average

772
00:50:33,449 --> 00:50:37,409
hood activity that you've already done

773
00:50:35,039 --> 00:50:40,200
and building off of that that sounds a

774
00:50:37,409 --> 00:50:42,328
lot more powerful that you can do versus

775
00:50:40,199 --> 00:51:51,558
if you've never done a certain average

776
00:50:42,329 --> 00:51:51,559
activity before you've done to reach you

777
00:52:05,900 --> 00:52:10,829
[Music]

778
00:52:08,239 --> 00:52:13,469
yeah and from the other side so you have

779
00:52:10,829 --> 00:52:15,568
a more ply project so they working on

780
00:52:13,469 --> 00:52:17,818
Disney's r6 cucumbers if you don't have

781
00:52:15,568 --> 00:52:20,038
like trial Emmys on-farm like health and

782
00:52:17,818 --> 00:52:22,170
help farmers in your broader impact

783
00:52:20,039 --> 00:52:23,489
statement I feel like what like you just

784
00:52:22,170 --> 00:52:25,289
talked about a very applied Kaji but

785
00:52:23,489 --> 00:52:27,778
it's not part of your impact statement

786
00:52:25,289 --> 00:52:30,028
so yes yeah kind of like keep telling it

787
00:52:27,778 --> 00:52:31,768
to how your what's our product you're

788
00:52:30,028 --> 00:52:36,708
proposing and make sure it's consistent

789
00:52:31,768 --> 00:52:36,708
throughout yeah

790
00:53:16,570 --> 00:53:24,350
[Music]

791
00:53:52,639 --> 00:53:55,779
[Music]

792
00:54:03,010 --> 00:54:06,039
[Music]

793
00:54:06,519 --> 00:54:11,989
yeah so that comment was reminding you

794
00:54:10,250 --> 00:54:13,969
of a website you maybe heard about

795
00:54:11,989 --> 00:54:16,129
yesterday pathways to science which is a

796
00:54:13,969 --> 00:54:20,829
great resource and there's always going

797
00:54:16,130 --> 00:54:23,840
to more specific resources out there so

798
00:54:20,829 --> 00:54:25,759
talking to red students and professors

799
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:31,579
can be another way of finding those if

800
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:33,950
you don't know them well I think we're

801
00:54:31,579 --> 00:54:36,349
about out of time so thanks everyone for

802
00:54:33,949 --> 00:54:38,779
listening and if you come up with more

803
00:54:36,349 --> 00:54:39,920
questions at any point we'll both be

804
00:54:38,780 --> 00:54:52,650
around

805
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:56,338
make sure this has been a production of

806
00:54:52,650 --> 00:54:59,269
Cornell University on the web at Cornell

807
