1
00:00:07,918 --> 00:00:14,160
and I think we're going to move into the

2
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:14,160
meat of the

3
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:21,079
presentation and I'd like to introduce

4
00:00:16,879 --> 00:00:23,879
our first Speaker Sonia schloman is the

5
00:00:21,079 --> 00:00:27,198
um extension small fruit specialist at

6
00:00:23,879 --> 00:00:30,239
the University of Massachusetts and she

7
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:32,239
specializes on all Berry crops um and I

8
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:35,280
have found her to be a real great

9
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:37,280
resource because I'm in Eastern New York

10
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,480
right around the Albany area so it's

11
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:43,359
wonderful to have somebody of her

12
00:00:39,479 --> 00:00:45,439
expertise um that close to us and I uh

13
00:00:43,359 --> 00:00:48,238
really thank her for being she's been an

14
00:00:45,439 --> 00:00:51,119
active part of The Advisory Group for

15
00:00:48,238 --> 00:00:52,959
this program and I'm very happy to have

16
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:55,878
her talk about pollination issues in

17
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:57,920
blueberry production and Sonia hopefully

18
00:00:55,878 --> 00:01:00,320
that um audio is going to work just fine

19
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:02,239
I'm going to actually get off and that

20
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,840
way I won't interfere with your

21
00:01:02,238 --> 00:01:08,599
audio okay Laura thank you so

22
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:10,880
much can everybody hear me I hope so um

23
00:01:08,599 --> 00:01:13,359
I guess there's a thumbs up button that

24
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:16,158
can be used um down on the lower left

25
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:18,000
hand of your screen or thumbs down I

26
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:20,960
guess would be the other thing you could

27
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,280
do um but with that I'm just going to go

28
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:26,959
ahead and get started and hopefully

29
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:28,879
everybody can hear me um I was asked to

30
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:30,519
uh present some information today on

31
00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:32,319
pollination issues

32
00:01:30,519 --> 00:01:35,158
in commercial blueberry production and

33
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:38,000
I'm going to be talking primarily about

34
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:40,040
high Bush blueberries although a lot of

35
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,640
what I'm uh the concepts that I'm going

36
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:45,759
to cover are going to be useful in low

37
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:48,920
busher wild blueberry production as well

38
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:50,920
um I wanted to start by just going over

39
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:52,799
uh a little bit of information about the

40
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:55,560
structure of blueberry flowers because

41
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:58,840
it helps explain some of the issues that

42
00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:02,159
come up with uh blueberry uh

43
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:04,320
pollination so uh the blueberry flower

44
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:06,680
is considered uh to be a flower that's

45
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:10,719
both perfect and complete which means

46
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:13,560
that it has all of the necessary Parts

47
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:16,439
um for pollination has a cix Corolla

48
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:20,640
Stam and Pistol uh all together in one

49
00:02:16,439 --> 00:02:23,959
flower structure um interestingly with

50
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:26,719
the blueberry flowers the uh the the

51
00:02:23,959 --> 00:02:30,000
Corola uh which is um essentially the

52
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:33,239
flower petals that you would find uh on

53
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:36,360
other kinds of flowers are fused so it's

54
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:38,680
kind of a tubular structure and out

55
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:41,879
outside sticking outside of that tubular

56
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:43,719
structure is a um the stigma which has

57
00:02:41,878 --> 00:02:45,679
the pollen tube in it and the pollen

58
00:02:43,719 --> 00:02:47,840
needs to land on the end of that stigma

59
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:51,280
and travel down the tube in order to

60
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:54,360
fertilize the uh the ovules that become

61
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:56,878
seeds um the nect is also very deep

62
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:59,120
within that tubular flower and because

63
00:02:56,878 --> 00:03:00,919
the flower petals are fused it makes it

64
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:04,719
a little bit challeng chenging for

65
00:03:00,919 --> 00:03:06,399
insects to gain access to the nect and

66
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:08,719
come in contact with the pollen that's

67
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,719
on the

68
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:14,000
anthers so we can see in this picture

69
00:03:11,719 --> 00:03:15,840
here um let's see if I can find my

70
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,560
little

71
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:21,920
arrow the uh you can see the the um

72
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:26,799
pollen tubes here sticking out outside

73
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:29,280
of the flower and um the uh the the

74
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:34,239
blueberries themselves each each flower

75
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:36,878
each y uh can potentially have 65 ovales

76
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:38,799
in it um so there's a lot of pollinating

77
00:03:36,878 --> 00:03:42,158
that needs to happen on each individual

78
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:44,640
flower um and also each individual bush

79
00:03:42,158 --> 00:03:47,598
has many many flowers you can see from

80
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:50,119
just this one picture here one branch on

81
00:03:47,598 --> 00:03:53,119
a blueberry bush has quite a few flowers

82
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:55,599
and over the entire Bush um there may be

83
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:57,519
as many as 2,000 or sometimes more

84
00:03:55,598 --> 00:04:02,318
flowers so that's uh that's a

85
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:06,360
significant challenge for pollination um

86
00:04:02,318 --> 00:04:08,798
and when uh pollination is going on if

87
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:11,519
uh an individual flower is not fully

88
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:14,519
pollinated in other words not all of the

89
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:18,160
ovules are fertilized and and become

90
00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:22,040
viable seeds then that fruit does not

91
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:24,000
develop as fully as a uh a fruit a

92
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:26,400
flower that's completely pollinated so

93
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:30,839
complete pollination is important for

94
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:33,719
generating a uh a marketable yield

95
00:04:30,839 --> 00:04:35,599
one of the things that um Growers can do

96
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:37,600
in order to determine whether or not

97
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:41,240
they're getting adequate

98
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:43,400
pollination um is to evaluate the uh the

99
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:46,680
pollinating activity during Bloom and

100
00:04:43,399 --> 00:04:48,799
also do an assessment after bloom um if

101
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:51,038
you're the weather conditions and other

102
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:53,800
environmental conditions during Bloon

103
00:04:51,038 --> 00:04:55,599
are making you suspect that perhaps uh

104
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:58,199
inadequate pollination is taking place

105
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:02,879
you can actually do some visual

106
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:04,400
observations uh um for a span of time

107
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:06,000
assessing the number of pollinators that

108
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:07,198
are actually entering flowers not just

109
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,639
the number of pollinators that are

110
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:12,439
flying around but ones that are landing

111
00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:15,560
on flowers and spending time visiting uh

112
00:05:12,439 --> 00:05:18,800
individual flowers so the

113
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:21,319
uh picture up on the right here sort of

114
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:24,120
indicates what that would look like here

115
00:05:21,319 --> 00:05:26,759
so it doesn't have to be any specific

116
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:29,680
species of bee but or pollinator but any

117
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:32,199
type of pollinator that's visiting um FL

118
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,800
flers and you want to have a minimum of

119
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:36,478
or an average I'm sorry of 20

120
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:38,079
pollinators in a 10-minute period uh

121
00:05:36,478 --> 00:05:40,240
visiting flowers and that will give you

122
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:42,879
an indication that enough activity is

123
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:46,120
happening during the bloom period after

124
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:48,120
bloom um there's also another um

125
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:49,918
assessment that can be done which

126
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:51,959
involves taking a look at the color of

127
00:05:49,918 --> 00:05:54,198
the Corollas that fall to the ground

128
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:55,879
after pollination or after bloom is

129
00:05:54,199 --> 00:05:59,360
complete and you can see in this picture

130
00:05:55,879 --> 00:06:01,879
here um many of these individual flowers

131
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:03,680
have fallen off uh there are a few still

132
00:06:01,879 --> 00:06:05,519
remaining and the ones that land on the

133
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:08,840
ground need to be a bright white in

134
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:11,799
color not brown or um gray or

135
00:06:08,839 --> 00:06:14,439
translucent uh if they're not uh fully

136
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:16,800
white in color for that first 24 hours

137
00:06:14,439 --> 00:06:18,240
or so after they land on the ground uh

138
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,360
it's an indication that they were not

139
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:23,720
fully

140
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:25,280
pollinated and finally uh at the end of

141
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:27,639
pollination after all of the flowers

142
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:30,478
have fallen off the ovaries the

143
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:32,319
pollinated uh fruit should swell rapidly

144
00:06:30,478 --> 00:06:34,639
stay kind of a green color and swell

145
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:37,960
rapidly and this picture here is a nice

146
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:40,038
one because it shows um the sizing up of

147
00:06:37,959 --> 00:06:41,159
the the the nicely pollinated fruit but

148
00:06:40,038 --> 00:06:42,759
there's one here that didn't get

149
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:45,160
pollinated so that would be an

150
00:06:42,759 --> 00:06:46,479
indication uh of a a failure to

151
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:49,520
pollinate and if you have a high

152
00:06:46,478 --> 00:06:51,519
percentage of those in uh the the

153
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:55,120
clusters of fruit on your blueberry bush

154
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:55,120
you may find that you have inadequate

155
00:06:55,598 --> 00:07:01,120
pollination so what do most commercial

156
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:02,960
blueberry operations do for pollination

157
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,759
well most of them rely at least in New

158
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:06,318
England I'm not sure if this is true

159
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:08,560
across the country but in New England

160
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:10,680
still most of our commercial blueberry

161
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:13,399
oper operations will rely on honeybees

162
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:15,800
for pollination and they might be um

163
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:19,120
hives that they maintain themselves on

164
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:23,680
the farm um or they might be hired in uh

165
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:26,879
as a pollination service although we're

166
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:29,079
finding now that many uh Growers are

167
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:30,199
considering some alternatives to honey

168
00:07:29,079 --> 00:07:32,279
bees and we we're going to talk about

169
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:34,319
that in a little more detail uh in just

170
00:07:32,279 --> 00:07:38,359
a little

171
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:41,039
bit um so while honeybees are uh the

172
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:44,598
primary source of pollination uh or what

173
00:07:41,038 --> 00:07:46,439
Growers rely on in blueberries uh it's

174
00:07:44,598 --> 00:07:49,560
important to have an idea of how many

175
00:07:46,439 --> 00:07:51,959
honey bees are needed um generally

176
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:54,360
speaking uh we recommend anywhere from

177
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:58,158
one to three hives per acre and the

178
00:07:54,360 --> 00:08:00,439
range um is defined by by a couple of

179
00:07:58,158 --> 00:08:02,279
things one of the characteristics is

180
00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:04,639
going to be the varieties of blueberries

181
00:08:02,279 --> 00:08:06,198
that you're growing uh some of some

182
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:10,598
blueberry varieties are more attractive

183
00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:12,598
to honeybees than others um although in

184
00:08:10,598 --> 00:08:14,399
New England at least most of our

185
00:08:12,598 --> 00:08:16,918
blueberry operations have a pretty wide

186
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:19,038
range of varieties so fine-tuning the

187
00:08:16,918 --> 00:08:21,279
number of hives based on varieties that

188
00:08:19,038 --> 00:08:23,038
are grown is is somewhat difficult so

189
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:25,079
you need to sort of get a ballpark idea

190
00:08:23,038 --> 00:08:27,079
of what's going to be enough another

191
00:08:25,079 --> 00:08:28,439
element that's going to Define how many

192
00:08:27,079 --> 00:08:31,158
hives you need is going to be the

193
00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:35,958
population of wild pollinators that you

194
00:08:31,158 --> 00:08:38,519
might have in your area so

195
00:08:35,958 --> 00:08:41,119
um I'm just noticing here some comments

196
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:42,918
about sound I'm I guess I hope that

197
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:45,399
everybody can hear me I can hear you

198
00:08:42,918 --> 00:08:49,679
perfectly I'm hoping that everyone else

199
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:52,879
can hear as well um okay it looks like

200
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:54,958
it was it is a little tiny bit crackly

201
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:58,039
but basically I would just keep going

202
00:08:54,958 --> 00:09:00,278
and I'll let you know if there's a big

203
00:08:58,039 --> 00:09:02,958
problem all right well I can turn my

204
00:09:00,278 --> 00:09:05,078
microphone up a little bit if necessary

205
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:06,559
or the volume you just let me know

206
00:09:05,078 --> 00:09:12,000
volume is

207
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:14,799
fine okay all right um all right so the

208
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,958
the population of wild uh pollinators is

209
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:20,599
going to have a an influence on how many

210
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:22,799
hives need to be um used to supplement

211
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:26,639
um natural pollination that's happening

212
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:29,199
in a particular uh blueberry planting uh

213
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:31,399
if you are using honeybees um whether or

214
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:33,879
not their hives that you're um

215
00:09:31,399 --> 00:09:35,278
maintaining yourself or bringing in um

216
00:09:33,879 --> 00:09:36,679
when you place them you want to make

217
00:09:35,278 --> 00:09:39,919
sure that they're placed in a somewhat

218
00:09:36,679 --> 00:09:43,639
sheltered location away from driving

219
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:45,519
wind and rain and so forth um another

220
00:09:43,639 --> 00:09:48,039
important concept is to make sure that

221
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:50,560
you place them in your Blueberry field

222
00:09:48,039 --> 00:09:52,679
or blueberry planting once Bloom has

223
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:54,439
actually already started if they're

224
00:09:52,679 --> 00:09:57,239
placed in the field too

225
00:09:54,440 --> 00:10:00,279
soon um blueberries blueberries are not

226
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:01,879
terribly attractive to honeybees because

227
00:10:00,278 --> 00:10:03,600
uh they're a little bit difficult for

228
00:10:01,879 --> 00:10:05,240
honey bees to pollinate compared to some

229
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:08,600
other flowers so if they find another

230
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:12,320
nectar source nearby whether it's other

231
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:14,800
flowering fruiting crops or dandelions

232
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:17,360
or something else and they Orient to

233
00:10:14,799 --> 00:10:19,759
those flowers uh by the time that

234
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:21,519
blueberries begin to bloom they may

235
00:10:19,759 --> 00:10:22,759
Overlook them they may bypass them

236
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:25,120
entirely because they're already

237
00:10:22,759 --> 00:10:26,319
oriented to another flower source so you

238
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:29,039
want to make sure that when you bring

239
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,920
your bees into the blueberry uh planting

240
00:10:29,039 --> 00:10:31,759
there's

241
00:10:29,919 --> 00:10:34,519
an adequate and abundant source of

242
00:10:31,759 --> 00:10:35,958
flowers for them to visit and Orient to

243
00:10:34,519 --> 00:10:38,360
so that they'll stay in that planting

244
00:10:35,958 --> 00:10:41,399
and not go somewhere else you also want

245
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:44,079
to make sure that you place the hives uh

246
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:46,278
if possible in such a location where the

247
00:10:44,078 --> 00:10:48,599
entrance can be Facing East which will

248
00:10:46,278 --> 00:10:50,759
allow the sun light to hit it early

249
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:54,200
enough in the day and and uh encourage

250
00:10:50,759 --> 00:10:56,519
early activity of

251
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:58,920
honeybees um this is a chart that you'll

252
00:10:56,519 --> 00:11:01,759
find uh in one form or another in a lot

253
00:10:58,919 --> 00:11:03,360
of different Publications this is from

254
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:05,399
uh Gary's wonderful

255
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,079
newsletter and it just gives you an idea

256
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:09,600
of the different varieties and their

257
00:11:07,078 --> 00:11:14,120
relative attractiveness to

258
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:17,000
honeybees um and uh again if you have a

259
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:19,320
an abundance of a certain variety or or

260
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,120
varieties that tend more to the

261
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:23,360
attractive or to the less attractive

262
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:26,440
side it may help you decide how many

263
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:28,278
hives are needed but um it's a useful

264
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:30,120
tool although I haven't found one

265
00:11:28,278 --> 00:11:32,639
recently that has a lot of the newer

266
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:34,759
varieties on it and perhaps um Gary can

267
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:36,360
help us with that information if he

268
00:11:34,759 --> 00:11:39,439
knows where to find a chart that

269
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:41,800
includes uh newer

270
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:46,240
varieties honey bees do have some

271
00:11:41,799 --> 00:11:48,719
limitations um the main limitation uh in

272
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:50,480
recent years has been the fact that that

273
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:52,879
b colonies have suffered from a number

274
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:56,079
of different diseases and parasites

275
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:58,000
probably the most notable currently is

276
00:11:56,078 --> 00:12:01,000
what's called colony collapse disorder

277
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:04,120
which isn't very well understood yet but

278
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:06,039
it's certainly um quite pervasive and is

279
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:08,480
uh really reducing the U the

280
00:12:06,039 --> 00:12:11,879
availability of a lot of uh commercial

281
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:14,800
honeybee uh hives veroom mites and

282
00:12:11,879 --> 00:12:16,679
tramites have also been a problem um in

283
00:12:14,799 --> 00:12:19,000
recent years there are a number of

284
00:12:16,679 --> 00:12:21,399
management strategies that can be used

285
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:24,198
to help with those fou brood has been

286
00:12:21,399 --> 00:12:26,039
known for quite a long time and most uh

287
00:12:24,198 --> 00:12:27,958
commercial beekeepers are are familiar

288
00:12:26,039 --> 00:12:30,159
with how to deal with that but the net

289
00:12:27,958 --> 00:12:33,479
result is that there really are fewer

290
00:12:30,159 --> 00:12:35,838
commercial hives available currently um

291
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:38,600
and it's harder to obtain them or

292
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:40,959
contract to have them brought in to uh

293
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:44,560
pollinate fruit crops there are also

294
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:46,399
fewer wild colonies available so that we

295
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:48,919
really need to start thinking about some

296
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:52,000
alternative strategies to help um

297
00:12:48,919 --> 00:12:52,000
achieve pollination in

298
00:12:52,919 --> 00:12:57,879
blueberries one of the things that we

299
00:12:55,039 --> 00:12:59,679
can do and this would be true both for

300
00:12:57,879 --> 00:13:01,519
uh wild and domestic pollinators

301
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:04,838
honeybees as well as other uh

302
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:07,600
pollinating insects is to be mindful of

303
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:10,320
certain specific recommendations that we

304
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:13,320
make that have to do with um insecticide

305
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:16,278
applications most spray guides and Pest

306
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:18,639
Management recommendations will very

307
00:13:16,278 --> 00:13:20,958
prominently uh recommend to avoid

308
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:23,519
spraying insecticides during Bloom and

309
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:26,359
this is of course a very important

310
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:28,240
practice in the event though that you

311
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:31,079
find yourself in a situation where you

312
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:33,839
feel that you need to to apply something

313
00:13:31,078 --> 00:13:36,479
um for a specific pest that is

314
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:40,160
threatening your crop there are certain

315
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:42,759
um considerations to keep in mind most

316
00:13:40,159 --> 00:13:47,039
of our manuals uh will

317
00:13:42,759 --> 00:13:49,399
include charts and tables that will list

318
00:13:47,039 --> 00:13:51,319
um various materials mostly it's

319
00:13:49,399 --> 00:13:52,958
insecticides but it also includes some

320
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:55,959
fungicides and

321
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:58,799
herbicides that um and they're rated in

322
00:13:55,958 --> 00:14:01,278
terms of their toxicity to pollinators

323
00:13:58,799 --> 00:14:02,599
so so that for the the particular pest

324
00:14:01,278 --> 00:14:05,720
that you need to control you want to

325
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:08,240
make sure to consult this list and among

326
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:10,160
your options choose the least toxic to

327
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:13,360
pollinators if you feel that you have to

328
00:14:10,159 --> 00:14:15,519
apply something during Bloom um

329
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:18,039
sometimes there's not a lot of choices a

330
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:19,759
lot of good choices available to you um

331
00:14:18,039 --> 00:14:22,078
but to the extent possible it's

332
00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:24,440
important to choose the least toxic

333
00:14:22,078 --> 00:14:27,359
material the other thing is to make sure

334
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:30,600
to spray as late in the day as you can

335
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:32,919
um and this is important because um many

336
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:34,240
times pollinating insects will return to

337
00:14:32,919 --> 00:14:35,198
their nests at the end of the day

338
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,839
especially

339
00:14:35,198 --> 00:14:39,479
honeybees um and so you want to try to

340
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:43,000
make your applications at a time when

341
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:44,639
they are not outworking uh any flowers

342
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,360
so as late in the day as you can this

343
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:49,879
also allows the spray material to dry

344
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:53,759
and be absorbed into the plant tissue

345
00:14:49,879 --> 00:14:55,679
overnight and um be less accessible to

346
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:59,399
pollinators when they resume working in

347
00:14:55,679 --> 00:15:03,000
the morning and also to try to use uh um

348
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:04,839
liquid formulations of materials as

349
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,240
opposed to dusts or any kind of powdered

350
00:15:04,839 --> 00:15:09,959
formulation that's likely to leave some

351
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:11,919
kind of residue that the uh the bees can

352
00:15:09,958 --> 00:15:14,359
pick up when they begin working the

353
00:15:11,919 --> 00:15:14,360
following

354
00:15:18,679 --> 00:15:24,599
day um this is just an example of one of

355
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:26,320
the lists and again they're um found in

356
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:29,199
in many different uh guides and

357
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:32,399
recommendation Publications some includ

358
00:15:29,198 --> 00:15:35,159
more materials than others um more

359
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:36,720
expanded list um this is just one that

360
00:15:35,159 --> 00:15:38,879
comes out of the New England small fruit

361
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:42,079
Pest Management guide but again it gives

362
00:15:38,879 --> 00:15:44,639
you an idea of what category um

363
00:15:42,078 --> 00:15:47,479
different materials fall in including

364
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:50,480
the slightly toxic or not considered

365
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:50,480
non-toxic

366
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:58,680
materials okay now the other strategy

367
00:15:55,759 --> 00:16:02,278
that people can employ when uh wanting

368
00:15:58,679 --> 00:16:04,278
to get uh full pollination in their

369
00:16:02,278 --> 00:16:06,639
commercial blueberries is the use of

370
00:16:04,278 --> 00:16:08,159
native pollinators uh and there's a lot

371
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:09,959
of literature out there a lot of

372
00:16:08,159 --> 00:16:12,159
different studies uh being done

373
00:16:09,958 --> 00:16:14,758
currently on this topic and some very

374
00:16:12,159 --> 00:16:17,078
good Publications one of the best that I

375
00:16:14,759 --> 00:16:19,318
came across was a study uh that was done

376
00:16:17,078 --> 00:16:21,278
in at Michigan State uh that was

377
00:16:19,318 --> 00:16:23,439
published this year uh it was a

378
00:16:21,278 --> 00:16:25,639
three-year study U very comprehensive

379
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:27,360
study at 15 blueberry farms and rather

380
00:16:25,639 --> 00:16:29,440
than give you lots of different charts

381
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:31,919
and graphs and everything

382
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:33,880
um I I'll just kind of cut to the Chase

383
00:16:31,919 --> 00:16:37,120
and let you know that what they found

384
00:16:33,879 --> 00:16:38,919
was about 112 species of uh Native

385
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:42,078
pollinators that were active during

386
00:16:38,919 --> 00:16:45,000
blueberry Bloom they found 166 alog

387
00:16:42,078 --> 00:16:47,078
together spanning a time period longer

388
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:51,000
than just the blueberry Bloom period but

389
00:16:47,078 --> 00:16:52,838
at least 50% of those 112 species were

390
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,159
contributing significantly to

391
00:16:52,839 --> 00:16:58,680
pollination so that just tells us that

392
00:16:55,159 --> 00:17:00,838
we have a very potent resource out there

393
00:16:58,679 --> 00:17:03,000
in our native pollinators that we can be

394
00:17:00,839 --> 00:17:05,160
taking advantage

395
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:08,959
of what are these

396
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:11,558
species well um probably the one that we

397
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:13,400
hear the most about are bumblebees um

398
00:17:11,558 --> 00:17:15,519
there are many Native species of

399
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:17,720
bumblebees across the country they're

400
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:20,480
very effective at pollinating uh

401
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:23,439
blueberries partly because of their size

402
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:25,078
um honeybees because are they're sort of

403
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:27,880
an in between size they're a little bit

404
00:17:25,078 --> 00:17:30,079
too big to crawl inside that Corolla and

405
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:33,039
really get a lot of contact with the uh

406
00:17:30,079 --> 00:17:35,199
the pollen um but they're also a little

407
00:17:33,038 --> 00:17:37,240
bit too small to reach very effectively

408
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,720
all the way in with their mouth Parts

409
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:40,720
Bumblebees are large enough that they

410
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:42,919
can reach right in and make a lot of

411
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:45,200
good contact with the interior of the

412
00:17:42,919 --> 00:17:48,000
flower they also do something called

413
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:50,240
sonicating which is

414
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,759
essentially uh where they engage their

415
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:53,759
flight muscles without spreading their

416
00:17:51,759 --> 00:17:57,480
wings and they kind of vibrate when

417
00:17:53,759 --> 00:17:59,359
they're um working a particular flower

418
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:02,798
and it shakes some of the PO poen off of

419
00:17:59,359 --> 00:18:04,558
the anthers uh Falls onto their bodies

420
00:18:02,798 --> 00:18:07,038
and then they can transport that pollen

421
00:18:04,558 --> 00:18:10,200
from one flower to another they're also

422
00:18:07,038 --> 00:18:12,440
known for working um a lot more hours in

423
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:15,840
a day than honeybees so that's a real

424
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:17,919
Advantage um they'll work for example in

425
00:18:15,839 --> 00:18:19,798
cool cloudy conditions where oftentimes

426
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:21,840
we won't see honeybees leaving their

427
00:18:19,798 --> 00:18:25,000
hives and they're also commercially

428
00:18:21,839 --> 00:18:25,000
available which is very

429
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:31,159
useful um the next sort of big category

430
00:18:28,839 --> 00:18:33,639
or the osmia species there's a lot of

431
00:18:31,159 --> 00:18:37,000
different osmia bees Orchard Mason bees

432
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:39,840
HornFans are a couple um that that are

433
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,240
commonly referred to Horn face bees for

434
00:18:39,839 --> 00:18:44,319
example have been used for a long time

435
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:47,200
in Japan for pollinating apples and

436
00:18:44,319 --> 00:18:50,038
interestingly what they found is that it

437
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:52,440
only requires somewhere from 3 to 800

438
00:18:50,038 --> 00:18:54,759
individual horn face bees to pollinate

439
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:57,279
an acre of apples and this is compared

440
00:18:54,759 --> 00:18:59,879
to 60 to

441
00:18:57,279 --> 00:19:02,158
120,000 honey

442
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:04,120
so you can see that they're very

443
00:19:02,159 --> 00:19:07,600
efficient

444
00:19:04,119 --> 00:19:10,399
pollinators uh they nest in reads and

445
00:19:07,599 --> 00:19:13,959
tubes and and holes in wood woodpecker

446
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:17,200
holes and uh insect tunnels that are in

447
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:19,640
uh decaying um wood and the forest

448
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:22,120
surrounding um a blueberry planting but

449
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:25,840
they're also commercially available so

450
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:28,319
this is a good resource for

451
00:19:25,839 --> 00:19:30,359
us uh another category is the leaf

452
00:19:28,319 --> 00:19:33,918
cutter bees there's a lot of different

453
00:19:30,359 --> 00:19:36,038
species in this um genus as well Al

454
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:38,200
alfafa leaf cutter bees have been used

455
00:19:36,038 --> 00:19:39,798
actually pretty extensively in Maine for

456
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:42,080
pollinating wild blueberries so there's

457
00:19:39,798 --> 00:19:45,440
a lot of good literature on those and

458
00:19:42,079 --> 00:19:47,798
again they're also um commercially

459
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:50,840
available one of my personal favorites

460
00:19:47,798 --> 00:19:52,679
is the Shaggy fuzzy foot bee um I I'm

461
00:19:50,839 --> 00:19:55,279
not sure that I've actually seen one of

462
00:19:52,679 --> 00:19:57,840
these but I like their name um and they

463
00:19:55,279 --> 00:19:59,158
are also identified as being significant

464
00:19:57,839 --> 00:20:02,599
pollinators

465
00:19:59,159 --> 00:20:04,280
um of a lot of different uh flowers uh

466
00:20:02,599 --> 00:20:05,879
I'm not I don't believe that they're

467
00:20:04,279 --> 00:20:08,639
commercially available at least not at

468
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:11,039
this point but um but they're definitely

469
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:12,480
an important uh constituent of the

470
00:20:11,038 --> 00:20:15,240
pollinating

471
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:18,079
population then there's carpenter bees

472
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:20,079
now carpenter bees can be found um

473
00:20:18,079 --> 00:20:22,199
pollinating or trying to to work

474
00:20:20,079 --> 00:20:26,319
blueberry flowers they look a lot like

475
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:28,159
bumblebees except that um they don't

476
00:20:26,319 --> 00:20:30,399
have that fuzzy appearance they lack the

477
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:32,360
fine ears on their bodies so that they

478
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:35,000
have a a more shiny appearance but

479
00:20:32,359 --> 00:20:37,678
otherwise they're similar in size and

480
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:40,079
shape uh to uh

481
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:42,600
bumblebees but

482
00:20:40,079 --> 00:20:44,199
um they don't do a good job of

483
00:20:42,599 --> 00:20:45,798
pollinating because what they will do is

484
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:49,919
chew holes in the side of blueberry

485
00:20:45,798 --> 00:20:52,319
blossoms bypassing the anthers and um

486
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:54,679
the pollen tubes so that they cannot um

487
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:57,879
actually achieve any kind of pollination

488
00:20:54,679 --> 00:20:59,038
so they are not what's considered a a

489
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:00,280
good pollinator but but it's good to

490
00:20:59,038 --> 00:21:02,759
know the difference because if you're

491
00:21:00,279 --> 00:21:04,119
making observations in your field you

492
00:21:02,759 --> 00:21:06,319
want to know whether what you're

493
00:21:04,119 --> 00:21:10,479
counting are carpenter bees or

494
00:21:06,319 --> 00:21:11,960
bumblebees this is just excuse me a uh a

495
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:13,640
little

496
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:17,798
diagram

497
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:19,880
um you can see here is a a carpenter bee

498
00:21:17,798 --> 00:21:22,359
that's working on uh blueberries and you

499
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:24,360
can see rather than trying to enter the

500
00:21:22,359 --> 00:21:26,519
flowers that are open it's just chewing

501
00:21:24,359 --> 00:21:29,558
into the side it'll create these little

502
00:21:26,519 --> 00:21:32,278
slits on the side and uh go right into

503
00:21:29,558 --> 00:21:34,440
the nectar and get some nectar out this

504
00:21:32,278 --> 00:21:35,839
picture here is showing us a number of

505
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:39,120
different species of

506
00:21:35,839 --> 00:21:42,480
bumblebees um here across in sort of an

507
00:21:39,119 --> 00:21:45,359
arc in the picture um and in the middle

508
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:47,240
is an example of a carpenter bee and you

509
00:21:45,359 --> 00:21:50,038
can see that it looks rather similar but

510
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:52,200
there's this very shiny black abdomen

511
00:21:50,038 --> 00:21:55,158
that makes it distinctively different

512
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:58,159
from the other um than the than the

513
00:21:55,159 --> 00:21:58,159
bumblebees

514
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,679
I can see that there's a question here

515
00:22:01,599 --> 00:22:06,959
about the number of quads of bumblebees

516
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:09,640
per acre I don't remember off the top of

517
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:12,159
my head and I I know that that

518
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:13,759
information is pretty readily available

519
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:17,000
from the commercial

520
00:22:13,759 --> 00:22:19,879
suppliers um and so I would sort of

521
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,480
hesitate to make a suggestion um right

522
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:23,320
off the top of my head but I know that

523
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:25,200
it's a that's an piece of information

524
00:22:23,319 --> 00:22:27,439
that's pretty easy to find

525
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:30,960
out um and I'm going to talk just a

526
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:30,960
little bit more about Bumblebee in a

527
00:22:31,839 --> 00:22:37,959
second um all right so here we are so

528
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:40,960
again with the Bumblebees um there's a

529
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:43,200
wide range of species um out there uh

530
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:44,798
there's a couple different pictures of

531
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:48,080
uh a couple of different species here

532
00:22:44,798 --> 00:22:50,558
both working on blueberries um they work

533
00:22:48,079 --> 00:22:52,480
on a wide range of conditions um they're

534
00:22:50,558 --> 00:22:55,158
more effective at reaching into the

535
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:56,960
flowers and actually achieving

536
00:22:55,159 --> 00:22:58,960
pollination plus they do that

537
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:01,798
sonicating um

538
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:03,159
ction commercial bumblebee hives are

539
00:23:01,798 --> 00:23:05,679
pretty readily available they're the

540
00:23:03,159 --> 00:23:08,120
most widely used pollinator for

541
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:10,840
Greenhouse Tomatoes which are uh

542
00:23:08,119 --> 00:23:13,839
becoming more and more popular uh so

543
00:23:10,839 --> 00:23:17,158
they're um the uh the hives that are

544
00:23:13,839 --> 00:23:19,519
available for interior uh locations like

545
00:23:17,159 --> 00:23:22,480
in a greenhouse are usually cardboard

546
00:23:19,519 --> 00:23:23,918
boxes um I suppose these could be used

547
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,480
outside if they're placed inside a

548
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:28,159
shelter of some sort but I don't think

549
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:30,278
they would hold up for um as long as the

550
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:32,760
ones that are actually designed to be

551
00:23:30,278 --> 00:23:34,960
outside um and they are both of those

552
00:23:32,759 --> 00:23:38,038
types are available and I'm sorry I

553
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:39,600
don't have a specific number of of quads

554
00:23:38,038 --> 00:23:41,359
there's different styles there's

555
00:23:39,599 --> 00:23:44,798
different sizes of boxes that are

556
00:23:41,359 --> 00:23:47,798
designed for different uses um and as I

557
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:47,798
said they're pretty readily

558
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:54,159
available um just again a little review

559
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:56,679
of the osmia um species there a lot of

560
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:59,760
different ones the main blueberry bee

561
00:23:56,679 --> 00:24:02,278
horn face bees blue Orchard bees um

562
00:23:59,759 --> 00:24:05,079
there's a whole publication dedicated uh

563
00:24:02,278 --> 00:24:09,558
to Blue Orchard bees that their acronym

564
00:24:05,079 --> 00:24:11,599
is Bob so they refer to how to raise Bob

565
00:24:09,558 --> 00:24:14,678
uh in a in a fruit

566
00:24:11,599 --> 00:24:16,599
planting many of these will nest in

567
00:24:14,679 --> 00:24:19,600
these types of tubes in nature it would

568
00:24:16,599 --> 00:24:20,879
be a bamboo or Reed section of some sort

569
00:24:19,599 --> 00:24:23,719
that would be their n one of their

570
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:26,320
natural sites but you can construct one

571
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:28,880
uh that's equally appealing to them uh

572
00:24:26,319 --> 00:24:32,158
simply by using cardboard tubes

573
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:33,760
similar to a straw um and these are uh

574
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:35,840
again commercially available there's a

575
00:24:33,759 --> 00:24:39,440
number of different sites that sell them

576
00:24:35,839 --> 00:24:43,199
a lot of the um work on on different

577
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:46,679
designs of nests was done by Dr batra

578
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:50,000
from beltzville Maryland I I believe she

579
00:24:46,679 --> 00:24:51,600
has left Beltsville now um and there's

580
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:54,038
another person that has kind of taken

581
00:24:51,599 --> 00:24:58,798
over her position there but there's some

582
00:24:54,038 --> 00:25:00,319
good information um this is uh here what

583
00:24:58,798 --> 00:25:03,398
one of the

584
00:25:00,319 --> 00:25:05,960
uh tubes might look like inside with the

585
00:25:03,398 --> 00:25:08,278
larv that are packed in you can see this

586
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:09,759
is must be a leaf cutter uh be of some

587
00:25:08,278 --> 00:25:13,000
sort you can see the little sections of

588
00:25:09,759 --> 00:25:13,000
leaves that are packed in

589
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:18,919
there if you want to construct or

590
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:22,000
purchase a uh a box full of these types

591
00:25:18,919 --> 00:25:24,720
of tubes you can create a shelter for uh

592
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:27,919
housing them pretty simply just

593
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:29,798
basically a a trash barrel laid on its

594
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:32,159
side and the tubes inside you want to

595
00:25:29,798 --> 00:25:34,879
put some kind of a screen or wire mesh

596
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:36,720
around the front of it because U various

597
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:39,440
Predators like skunks and and other

598
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:42,440
kinds of animals would be attracted to

599
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:44,399
that food source that uh the larv

600
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:46,080
present to them you want to also make

601
00:25:44,398 --> 00:25:47,959
sure you have some ventilation in there

602
00:25:46,079 --> 00:25:49,480
and a nice clear area in front of it

603
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:52,079
where the grass doesn't grow up and

604
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:52,079
obscure the

605
00:25:55,759 --> 00:26:02,079
entrance another option is to uh use a

606
00:25:59,278 --> 00:26:05,519
wooden block and drill um holes in the

607
00:26:02,079 --> 00:26:07,199
wooden block 5/16 or so uh in size not

608
00:26:05,519 --> 00:26:08,879
too thick and you also don't want them

609
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:11,679
drill all the way through they they need

610
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:15,240
to have only one opening uh in one end

611
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:20,440
of the block and um these

612
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:22,679
are um the types of um nesting sites

613
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:24,278
that we actually see somewhat commonly

614
00:26:22,679 --> 00:26:27,038
now in in a lot of different fruit

615
00:26:24,278 --> 00:26:30,319
plantings this picture here was taken I

616
00:26:27,038 --> 00:26:32,839
believe in uh IP switch haal area in

617
00:26:30,319 --> 00:26:35,839
Massachusetts a fairly sizable blueberry

618
00:26:32,839 --> 00:26:38,038
operation there um and I've seen them in

619
00:26:35,839 --> 00:26:40,839
other locations as well pretty

620
00:26:38,038 --> 00:26:44,200
inexpensive not a big commitment there

621
00:26:40,839 --> 00:26:47,158
to uh increasing the nesting sites for

622
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:47,159
uh wild

623
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:54,000
pollinators in addition to nesting sites

624
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:57,158
you also want to try to

625
00:26:54,000 --> 00:27:00,960
encourage um yearr round residents of

626
00:26:57,159 --> 00:27:03,440
these uh insects in your location by

627
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:07,200
making sure that you have some um

628
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:10,000
suitable flower uh food sources for them

629
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:11,720
throughout the year now Birch Maple Oak

630
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,119
uh popler Willow those are trees that

631
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:16,200
are pretty common at least in New

632
00:27:13,119 --> 00:27:19,759
England as food sources um but you can

633
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:22,080
also encourage some sort of wild areas

634
00:27:19,759 --> 00:27:25,278
uh with asers and some other kinds of

635
00:27:22,079 --> 00:27:27,319
wild um flowering plants rather than

636
00:27:25,278 --> 00:27:29,839
mowing everything just keeping a a few

637
00:27:27,319 --> 00:27:32,278
areas where uh they might find nectar

638
00:27:29,839 --> 00:27:35,480
sources uh in other times of the year

639
00:27:32,278 --> 00:27:35,480
besides when the blueberries are

640
00:27:36,919 --> 00:27:42,000
blooming so just to summarize the the

641
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:44,360
things that you can do to enhance the

642
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,599
suitability of your farm for these

643
00:27:44,359 --> 00:27:48,839
beneficial insects pollinating insects

644
00:27:46,599 --> 00:27:52,158
is to provide a habitat suitable for

645
00:27:48,839 --> 00:27:54,398
nesting encourage or plant flowering

646
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:56,600
plants that provide uh Bloom through the

647
00:27:54,398 --> 00:27:59,639
growing season they need to have some

648
00:27:56,599 --> 00:28:03,639
clean water so they need access to clean

649
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:05,440
water um nest building materials again

650
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:09,038
you know keeping a few areas that are

651
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:10,600
somewhat wild um and allow them to uh

652
00:28:09,038 --> 00:28:13,119
have access to materials that they need

653
00:28:10,599 --> 00:28:16,398
to to build the nests with and then to

654
00:28:13,119 --> 00:28:20,518
minimize your insecticide use during uh

655
00:28:16,398 --> 00:28:20,518
Bloom as much as as you possibly

656
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:26,278
can I did want to add um just a one

657
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:28,599
slide and again this is something that

658
00:28:26,278 --> 00:28:30,599
Gary may have a lot more information

659
00:28:28,599 --> 00:28:33,439
about if we have time for some questions

660
00:28:30,599 --> 00:28:34,918
and that is what you can do if even when

661
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:37,600
you've done all the other things that

662
00:28:34,919 --> 00:28:40,159
we've talked about you still have um

663
00:28:37,599 --> 00:28:43,079
poor pollination uh in a given year such

664
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:45,399
as this year for example we had um very

665
00:28:43,079 --> 00:28:48,038
cold windy rainy conditions in many

666
00:28:45,398 --> 00:28:51,000
areas during Bloom and as a result the

667
00:28:48,038 --> 00:28:53,319
flowers either set don't set fruit at

668
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,319
all or the fruit that they set is is

669
00:28:53,319 --> 00:28:56,359
poorly

670
00:28:54,319 --> 00:28:58,278
pollinated um one of the things that

671
00:28:56,359 --> 00:29:01,038
people have talked about doing in

672
00:28:58,278 --> 00:29:04,119
conditions like this is using uh a

673
00:29:01,038 --> 00:29:06,640
supplemental uh plant growth hormone

674
00:29:04,119 --> 00:29:08,959
application something uh like

675
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:10,720
gibberellin um there are a couple of

676
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:13,519
gibberellin products that are labeled

677
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:16,200
for use in blueberries prb and Gib grow

678
00:29:13,519 --> 00:29:18,440
are a couple that I'm aware of uh there

679
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:20,840
may be others and these are materials

680
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:23,480
that can be applied to your blueberries

681
00:29:20,839 --> 00:29:24,918
to help retain some of those um

682
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:27,480
unpollinated or what we call

683
00:29:24,919 --> 00:29:28,960
parthenocarpic fruit that have no viable

684
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:33,960
seeds in

685
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:36,240
uh or no um pollinated seeds um and or

686
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:38,960
for those fruit that have incomplete

687
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:42,519
pollination um it can help size up those

688
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:45,240
fruit as well um this these materials

689
00:29:42,519 --> 00:29:48,200
can be applied either in one spray or in

690
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:50,319
a split application um usually on the

691
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:54,600
order of 80 grams of active ingredient

692
00:29:50,319 --> 00:29:56,359
per acre um towards the end of Bloom um

693
00:29:54,599 --> 00:29:59,480
in a single application or towards the

694
00:29:56,359 --> 00:30:02,398
end of Bloom and then again um and 14

695
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:03,960
days after that in a split application

696
00:30:02,398 --> 00:30:07,278
uh it's important to have high spray

697
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:10,159
volume in order to get a lot of material

698
00:30:07,278 --> 00:30:13,240
um good coverage of the the plants with

699
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:15,278
um a high spray Val volume it's good if

700
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:17,599
you can to try to apply this when the

701
00:30:15,278 --> 00:30:20,798
drying conditions are slow so that you

702
00:30:17,599 --> 00:30:22,158
can increase absorption and as with is

703
00:30:20,798 --> 00:30:25,200
true with a number of different

704
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:27,200
materials to try to use materials uh to

705
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:29,120
to make sure that your spray water is um

706
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:32,840
the the correct pH in order for these

707
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:35,558
materials to work so

708
00:30:32,839 --> 00:30:38,398
um I I'm going to try to read some of

709
00:30:35,558 --> 00:30:38,398
these questions

710
00:30:39,319 --> 00:30:44,759
here uh the development of wild

711
00:30:42,278 --> 00:30:47,200
pollinators um such as wild bumblebees I

712
00:30:44,759 --> 00:30:50,319
think is primarily a matter of making

713
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:54,480
sure that we have um good nesting sites

714
00:30:50,319 --> 00:30:57,278
for them and uh maintaining some uh good

715
00:30:54,480 --> 00:31:01,519
wild areas in the periphery around the

716
00:30:57,278 --> 00:31:03,119
planting uh in order to allow them to um

717
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:04,880
develop some nests and also to get a

718
00:31:03,119 --> 00:31:07,319
good food

719
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:09,360
source uh the next question is do the

720
00:31:07,319 --> 00:31:11,678
parthenocarpic fruit have the same

721
00:31:09,359 --> 00:31:14,398
quality I don't think that they do I

722
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:16,399
think that they're um inherently smaller

723
00:31:14,398 --> 00:31:19,319
and I think the flavor is somewhat less

724
00:31:16,398 --> 00:31:21,398
but again we don't have many Growers or

725
00:31:19,319 --> 00:31:25,240
really any that I'm aware of that have

726
00:31:21,398 --> 00:31:27,638
tried using gibberellin in Massachusetts

727
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:29,319
at least and uh I'm Pro pretty sure we

728
00:31:27,638 --> 00:31:31,638
haven't seen much of it in New England

729
00:31:29,319 --> 00:31:36,119
but it's possible that in areas where

730
00:31:31,638 --> 00:31:37,638
there's more um significant large scale

731
00:31:36,119 --> 00:31:41,119
production of blueberries such as New

732
00:31:37,638 --> 00:31:44,278
Jersey or possibly Michigan that um that

733
00:31:41,119 --> 00:31:45,879
may be a more common practice so uh it

734
00:31:44,278 --> 00:31:47,038
may be true that Gary has something to

735
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:50,519
say about

736
00:31:47,038 --> 00:31:53,158
it um and then the last question oh if

737
00:31:50,519 --> 00:31:56,599
admire is used for Grobe control in June

738
00:31:53,159 --> 00:31:58,440
it could yes it could hurt bumblebees um

739
00:31:56,599 --> 00:32:00,759
and it that's going to be

740
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:04,000
um it's going to be important to use

741
00:32:00,759 --> 00:32:06,119
that very carefully um and not allow

742
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,038
drift into areas outside of the

743
00:32:06,119 --> 00:32:10,119
blueberry planting because most likely

744
00:32:08,038 --> 00:32:13,319
the Bumblebees are nesting and other

745
00:32:10,119 --> 00:32:15,479
natural pollinators are nesting in areas

746
00:32:13,319 --> 00:32:17,759
outside of the blueberry planting itself

747
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:20,399
so we need to be very very careful about

748
00:32:17,759 --> 00:32:23,480
drift um with spray materials such as

749
00:32:20,398 --> 00:32:27,000
admire um that have a systemic um

750
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:28,839
component um so that we protect the the

751
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:32,359
pollinators and other beneficial insects

752
00:32:28,839 --> 00:32:34,240
in the area around the uh the planting

753
00:32:32,359 --> 00:32:36,319
and then I guess the last question is if

754
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:38,919
Bumblebees are brought in will they they

755
00:32:36,319 --> 00:32:41,558
later colonized the area for next year I

756
00:32:38,919 --> 00:32:44,038
don't have a lot of direct information

757
00:32:41,558 --> 00:32:46,519
about that and I haven't found it in the

758
00:32:44,038 --> 00:32:48,519
studies um but my impression from a

759
00:32:46,519 --> 00:32:51,399
couple of Growers that I have that I

760
00:32:48,519 --> 00:32:55,038
know who've recently kind of adopted

761
00:32:51,398 --> 00:32:56,839
bumblebees in favor of uh over the use

762
00:32:55,038 --> 00:32:59,798
of honeybees and are very happy with

763
00:32:56,839 --> 00:33:02,519
them have found that the uh the there is

764
00:32:59,798 --> 00:33:05,960
a certain percentage of a bumblebee

765
00:33:02,519 --> 00:33:08,519
Colony that's brought in that will um

766
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:10,720
stick around that will become a resident

767
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:13,919
population U over time it may be

768
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:16,839
necessary to bring bumblebees in for a

769
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:18,919
few years before you have an adequate

770
00:33:16,839 --> 00:33:21,439
population that's established that will

771
00:33:18,919 --> 00:33:23,120
be reliable for an extended period of

772
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:27,480
time but I do think that they stick

773
00:33:23,119 --> 00:33:29,959
around um for you know from year to year

774
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:32,720
is impression

775
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:37,159
so I guess with that I think that's all

776
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:40,759
I've got um and I'm going to stay on the

777
00:33:37,159 --> 00:33:43,080
line and and um can take questions or

778
00:33:40,759 --> 00:33:46,240
comments from people if uh if there are

779
00:33:43,079 --> 00:33:48,240
any anybody um else have any questions

780
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:50,679
did you see the question about how long

781
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:52,960
is The Blossom viable for pollination

782
00:33:50,679 --> 00:33:56,399
and if you just answered that forgive me

783
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:59,038
because I had someone here talking to me

784
00:33:56,398 --> 00:34:01,079
did you see that last question

785
00:33:59,038 --> 00:34:02,599
I think there's a little bit of I think

786
00:34:01,079 --> 00:34:05,359
that there's a little bit of VI of

787
00:34:02,599 --> 00:34:07,439
variation with different varieties um

788
00:34:05,359 --> 00:34:10,199
but I would say that there's probably a

789
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:11,679
span of a week to 10 days depending on

790
00:34:10,199 --> 00:34:13,158
the the weather conditions you know

791
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:17,599
certain weather conditions are going to

792
00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:19,320
push the bloom period faster uh than

793
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:22,079
than other weather so in other words

794
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:24,800
when it's when it's sort of cold um

795
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:26,839
things it slows things down a bit uh as

796
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:29,760
opposed to if we get a spell where

797
00:34:26,838 --> 00:34:32,239
things are is the weather's very hot and

798
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:36,119
um the whole Bloom period becomes kind

799
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:38,279
of compressed and goes through uh the

800
00:34:36,119 --> 00:34:40,358
stages more quickly but I think on

801
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:43,200
average we're looking at uh something

802
00:34:40,358 --> 00:34:46,639
like a week for uh the availability of

803
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:49,480
pollination for for flowers all right

804
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:52,159
Sonia that was great and um if anybody

805
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:54,960
has any questions that come to them uh

806
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:57,160
while uh Dr pavs is speaking Sonia will

807
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:59,720
be here at the end and I really

808
00:34:57,159 --> 00:35:01,639
appreciate that thank you um give me a

809
00:34:59,719 --> 00:35:04,799
few moments here folks and I'm going to

810
00:35:01,639 --> 00:35:07,719
switch things around and introduce our

811
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:07,720
next um

812
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:27,119
speaker and our next speaker is um Dr

813
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:30,000
Gary pavas um he is a professor and EG

814
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:32,480
agent at rers University and his areas

815
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:35,039
of expertise are blueberry and grape and

816
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:36,559
wine production his blueberry newsletter

817
00:35:35,039 --> 00:35:38,800
the blueberry bulletin has an

818
00:35:36,559 --> 00:35:41,480
international following and he has done

819
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:43,560
a lot of research um transformative

820
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:45,559
research on blueberry

821
00:35:43,559 --> 00:35:47,440
fertilization um and he's been in

822
00:35:45,559 --> 00:35:50,480
instrumental in the expansion of the New

823
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:53,240
Jersey wine industry so if you um have

824
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:55,519
any wine questions after the blueberry

825
00:35:53,239 --> 00:35:58,519
presentation now you know who to ask

826
00:35:55,519 --> 00:36:01,800
them to but I'm so pleased to have Dr

827
00:35:58,519 --> 00:36:05,480
Gary pavas uh here to talk to us about

828
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:09,200
blueberry site preparation and fertility

829
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:09,199
considerations all right

830
00:36:09,679 --> 00:36:16,399
Gary thank you Laura thank you very much

831
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:18,440
uh and uh welcome everybody um we're

832
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:20,680
going to do a little bit about uh site

833
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:23,760
selection and I always put this slide on

834
00:36:20,679 --> 00:36:26,118
anybody who seen me give a talk um has

835
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:28,119
seen this uh slide typical harvest in

836
00:36:26,119 --> 00:36:29,960
New Jersey um

837
00:36:28,119 --> 00:36:31,480
and what I always say is well you know

838
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:33,240
if you don't have a harvest like this

839
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:34,880
where you are then I guess you need to

840
00:36:33,239 --> 00:36:38,078
listen up because this is what we do in

841
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:41,480
Jersey but in reality I'm sitting in the

842
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:44,200
research station in New Jersey and

843
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:48,318
looking out my window uh it's the pine

844
00:36:44,199 --> 00:36:51,598
Barons and um what reality is is that if

845
00:36:48,318 --> 00:36:53,000
you're going to grow blueberries you and

846
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:57,000
this is where blueberries High Bush

847
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:59,199
blueberries evolved um this is where uh

848
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:01,079
and what you have to basically produce

849
00:36:59,199 --> 00:37:03,439
reproduce if you want to grow

850
00:37:01,079 --> 00:37:07,440
blueberries um you know you have to

851
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:09,240
recreate our our climate here um you

852
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:11,440
know we have soils that are very

853
00:37:09,239 --> 00:37:13,639
specific for blueberries we have the the

854
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:15,880
pH organic matter water table all of

855
00:37:13,639 --> 00:37:17,400
this kind of thing is very specific for

856
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:19,160
high Bush blueberries and that's why

857
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:21,559
they do well so if you're going to grow

858
00:37:19,159 --> 00:37:24,358
High Bush blueberries this is what you

859
00:37:21,559 --> 00:37:24,358
are trying to

860
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:28,400
recreate um of course I always put this

861
00:37:26,838 --> 00:37:31,880
in front of any anyone that's going to

862
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:35,920
start um you know this is a perennial

863
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:37,960
crop and as such um there's a there's a

864
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:41,599
lot of eyes that need to be dotted and

865
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:42,960
tees that need to be crossed and I I

866
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:45,200
often tell people that with something

867
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:48,280
like a perenial crop uh this crop is

868
00:37:45,199 --> 00:37:50,358
sort of like children and that is that

869
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:51,240
any mistake you make today you will pay

870
00:37:50,358 --> 00:37:54,159
for

871
00:37:51,239 --> 00:37:56,479
tomorrow and so when you're getting

872
00:37:54,159 --> 00:37:58,399
started um you have to look at what it's

873
00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:01,000
going to cost for from an establishment

874
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:02,559
standpoint you really can't cut out

875
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,639
certain things well I don't I really

876
00:38:02,559 --> 00:38:05,799
don't have the money to put in the

877
00:38:03,639 --> 00:38:09,039
irrigation so I'm not going to do that

878
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:10,920
um you can't do things like that um and

879
00:38:09,039 --> 00:38:13,480
we'll talk a little bit about um the

880
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:15,838
cost a little later um and we we'll

881
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:18,119
mention some things about site selection

882
00:38:15,838 --> 00:38:20,400
um uh and the things that go along with

883
00:38:18,119 --> 00:38:23,559
that a little bit about varieties um

884
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:26,480
irrigation labor and marketing um so

885
00:38:23,559 --> 00:38:29,880
we'll get into some of this these things

886
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:34,400
um I mentioned the cost um see that one

887
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:36,119
pass the cost um the latest figures are

888
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:41,200
uh somewhere around

889
00:38:36,119 --> 00:38:42,838
$8500 um that I have um and you know

890
00:38:41,199 --> 00:38:45,239
they they if you look at this list

891
00:38:42,838 --> 00:38:46,480
you'll see that it's it's uh you know

892
00:38:45,239 --> 00:38:49,879
you probably could think of other things

893
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:53,039
that you could put in there but um but

894
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:55,880
certainly um uh things like irrigation

895
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:58,838
and sawdust Mulch and of course the

896
00:38:55,880 --> 00:39:01,318
plants land prep or all of these things

897
00:38:58,838 --> 00:39:03,440
um add up to this figure and and I've

898
00:39:01,318 --> 00:39:05,559
heard figures anywhere from you know

899
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:08,519
well it's only about $3,000 to set it up

900
00:39:05,559 --> 00:39:10,318
but but all of this comes into it and

901
00:39:08,519 --> 00:39:12,838
this should be taken into account if you

902
00:39:10,318 --> 00:39:15,599
if you're going to set up two acres or

903
00:39:12,838 --> 00:39:17,440
five acres or 10 acres well 10 acres is

904
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:21,000
you know $880,000

905
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:22,838
to set this up so I think um it's

906
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:25,559
imperative that um you know what you're

907
00:39:22,838 --> 00:39:27,920
getting into before you um go ahead and

908
00:39:25,559 --> 00:39:31,318
do this um

909
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:33,480
s selection is uh is certainly has a lot

910
00:39:31,318 --> 00:39:34,960
to do with uh taking a soil test and

911
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:37,760
finding out what you're starting off

912
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:41,000
with what are you have um as I said the

913
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:43,400
soils here in New Jersey where we are uh

914
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:46,039
right outside my window they are from

915
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:49,519
native standpoint 4.5 to

916
00:39:46,039 --> 00:39:55,440
4.8 um organic matter can be as high as

917
00:39:49,519 --> 00:39:57,920
9% um the water table is 18 in down and

918
00:39:55,440 --> 00:40:00,119
um so as a result um

919
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:02,639
what do you have um you know in New

920
00:40:00,119 --> 00:40:04,400
Jersey um when they try to plant

921
00:40:02,639 --> 00:40:08,838
blueberries in northern Jersey you have

922
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:11,039
a pH of of 72 in some places so um that

923
00:40:08,838 --> 00:40:14,480
has to be all taken care of before you

924
00:40:11,039 --> 00:40:17,000
ever ever uh get into planting

925
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:19,358
plants um this is what the pine Barons

926
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:21,960
looks like um I just thought I'd show

927
00:40:19,358 --> 00:40:24,078
you um in fact I was with some Growers

928
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:25,720
yesterday and uh they had told me they

929
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:28,880
were down here and they were amazed at

930
00:40:25,719 --> 00:40:31,879
the soil type um

931
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:33,318
um and you know this is this is the

932
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:36,519
typical this is actually an old picture

933
00:40:33,318 --> 00:40:41,119
from 1940s showing uh getting the

934
00:40:36,519 --> 00:40:44,039
getting the uh the land uh site level

935
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:46,720
and uh being able to work it and know

936
00:40:44,039 --> 00:40:49,199
actually where your water flow is going

937
00:40:46,719 --> 00:40:51,759
Etc um and here's another actually very

938
00:40:49,199 --> 00:40:54,118
old shot from the' 40s um this one

939
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:55,960
actually um as I understand it was was

940
00:40:54,119 --> 00:41:00,200
taken while we were setting up the

941
00:40:55,960 --> 00:41:02,599
research station um in the ' 60s um uh

942
00:41:00,199 --> 00:41:05,559
that I'm sitting at right

943
00:41:02,599 --> 00:41:06,599
now oops uh let's see I want to go

944
00:41:05,559 --> 00:41:10,078
forward

945
00:41:06,599 --> 00:41:14,318
there um but this is this is the typical

946
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:15,920
um planting um and uh you know if you're

947
00:41:14,318 --> 00:41:19,318
not used to this kind of thing you

948
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:21,639
notice the soil looks so white um but if

949
00:41:19,318 --> 00:41:25,239
you just uh kick away the the top

950
00:41:21,639 --> 00:41:29,279
surface you will actually see that um

951
00:41:25,239 --> 00:41:31,879
the it's black underneath and and that

952
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:35,280
reveals to you that yes it's Sandy it's

953
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:37,760
well- drained but it's also um high in

954
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:42,240
organic matter as I mentioned um it can

955
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:44,079
be uh you know 6 7 8 9% organic matter

956
00:41:42,239 --> 00:41:47,039
and you can also tell from that ditch

957
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:50,359
there where where the water table is um

958
00:41:47,039 --> 00:41:52,599
blueberries uh 90 95% of the uh roots of

959
00:41:50,358 --> 00:41:56,679
a blueberry plant are on the top 18 to

960
00:41:52,599 --> 00:41:58,480
24 in um they cannot be in standing

961
00:41:56,679 --> 00:42:02,679
water actually the research shows that

962
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:05,559
within 24 hours actually 27 hours of

963
00:42:02,679 --> 00:42:09,399
standing water um The Roots actually

964
00:42:05,559 --> 00:42:11,119
start to die so um they can't be you

965
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:12,960
know there's sort of a myth that people

966
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:15,760
think that blueberri is uh like to be in

967
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:19,280
swampy areas they they can't be in uh

968
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:21,760
wet areas um it has to be well drained

969
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:24,000
and The Roots can't be in uh standing

970
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:27,400
water but it does show you in New Jersey

971
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:30,599
what this um uh water table looks like

972
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:30,599
um in the pine baronss

973
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:37,520
here um this is a situation of course

974
00:42:33,239 --> 00:42:40,679
you don't want um this is uh this is a

975
00:42:37,519 --> 00:42:42,280
very wet situation uh we had a uh a few

976
00:42:40,679 --> 00:42:44,598
years ago we had a hurricane that came

977
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:47,440
through and uh this is on on one of the

978
00:42:44,599 --> 00:42:50,559
biggest farms uh in the area uh this

979
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:54,519
water is actually uh in excess of 3 ft

980
00:42:50,559 --> 00:42:57,359
deep and at that time um and this this

981
00:42:54,519 --> 00:42:59,519
unfortunately this water was only here

982
00:42:57,358 --> 00:43:01,598
like this for probably a day a day and a

983
00:42:59,519 --> 00:43:02,920
half I did have my reservations as to if

984
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:05,838
these plants were actually going to make

985
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:08,318
it but um this planting actually made it

986
00:43:05,838 --> 00:43:11,279
quite well um it was set back and yield

987
00:43:08,318 --> 00:43:14,000
that ye that next year but um but it

988
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:15,960
came back fine but um but it's

989
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,800
imperative to understand the need of

990
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:20,519
water and blueberries um the use of

991
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:24,318
irrigation but at the same time um you

992
00:43:20,519 --> 00:43:24,318
can't have blueberries in a wet

993
00:43:25,039 --> 00:43:31,358
site um and this is a situation where it

994
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:33,400
was a wet site um you notice that

995
00:43:31,358 --> 00:43:39,119
there's a whole whole area let's see if

996
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:39,119
I can um uh use my pointer

997
00:43:40,838 --> 00:43:49,279
here um this whole area here um is uh

998
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:53,880
all the plants have died out and the

999
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:56,519
reason is phop for root rot um and we

1000
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:57,720
confirmed this in the lab and as a

1001
00:43:56,519 --> 00:44:00,440
result

1002
00:43:57,719 --> 00:44:02,439
um uh you know this this was the

1003
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:05,000
irrigation uh not the irrigation the uh

1004
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:08,200
the drainage was just not adequate here

1005
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:10,760
and this is very tough to come back from

1006
00:44:08,199 --> 00:44:12,439
um so it's it's an important thing that

1007
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:15,640
this should have been uh really

1008
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:19,119
addressed early before um before this

1009
00:44:15,639 --> 00:44:19,118
planning was even ever put

1010
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:27,599
in um you know the question I often get

1011
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:30,440
is uh about soil type well you I don't

1012
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:34,200
have Sandy Sandy LOM soils can I grow

1013
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:36,480
blueberries um yes you can uh my

1014
00:44:34,199 --> 00:44:37,960
actually first uh exposure to

1015
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:40,199
blueberries was when I was getting my

1016
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:43,880
masters at the University of Arkansas

1017
00:44:40,199 --> 00:44:48,078
and those soils were heavy clay um silty

1018
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:50,880
clay soils and um so my first 5 years of

1019
00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:53,800
growing and dealing with blueberries was

1020
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:56,400
in an area that was not uh New Jersey

1021
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:58,760
Pine Barons and so we spent a lot of

1022
00:44:56,400 --> 00:45:01,280
time and a lot of work uh working on

1023
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:03,960
exactly what uh what does it take to

1024
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:07,240
grow blueberries in non-traditional

1025
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:11,400
soils and uh it can it definitely can be

1026
00:45:07,239 --> 00:45:13,118
done and and done very well um but as I

1027
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:15,400
said you need to dot the eyes and cross

1028
00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:15,400
all the

1029
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:20,000
teas one of the things that has to be

1030
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:23,079
done is as I mentioned the pine Baron is

1031
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:25,159
high organic matter um the organic

1032
00:45:23,079 --> 00:45:29,000
matter here is is high and the

1033
00:45:25,159 --> 00:45:32,399
blueberries uh really um need that and

1034
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:34,000
so um uh if you're not in the Jersey

1035
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:38,760
Pine Bar with that kind of organic

1036
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:40,679
matter you need to mulch um and uh we we

1037
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:42,880
did a lot of work in arkans to find out

1038
00:45:40,679 --> 00:45:44,480
what was the best mulch actually I I

1039
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:46,800
usually tell people the best mulch is

1040
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:50,519
whatever mulch you can get for cheap

1041
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:53,920
that's the best mulch um and you know

1042
00:45:50,519 --> 00:45:58,159
all you're trying to do is is uh get um

1043
00:45:53,920 --> 00:46:01,119
uh build up your organic matter um and

1044
00:45:58,159 --> 00:46:03,719
we actually did a study years ago um in

1045
00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:06,640
Arkansas uh testing these mulches and

1046
00:46:03,719 --> 00:46:09,759
this particular study was in Arkansas

1047
00:46:06,639 --> 00:46:14,078
and you're looking at a plant here and

1048
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:16,760
um and if you if you notice the um

1049
00:46:14,079 --> 00:46:19,640
there's there's markings on this stick

1050
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:23,119
and um after 4 years this plant had

1051
00:46:19,639 --> 00:46:27,519
grown to 2 feet and had no mulch the

1052
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:29,519
Wheats were kept down by um just um

1053
00:46:27,519 --> 00:46:32,280
hoing

1054
00:46:29,519 --> 00:46:36,440
and um and a plant that was planted at

1055
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:40,319
the same time with mulch you notice that

1056
00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:42,519
um this is 4T High um there's no

1057
00:46:40,318 --> 00:46:45,358
difference whatsoever except for the use

1058
00:46:42,519 --> 00:46:48,920
of mulch um The Mulch does a lot of good

1059
00:46:45,358 --> 00:46:51,440
things the mulch um uh increases of

1060
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:53,519
course your organic matter um it lowers

1061
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:55,920
the temperature the of the root Zone

1062
00:46:53,519 --> 00:46:59,599
which is which is a good thing um it

1063
00:46:55,920 --> 00:47:03,920
does suppress weeds to a degree um it

1064
00:46:59,599 --> 00:47:06,640
can run into troubles uh um mice and um

1065
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:11,000
different different uh uh animals you

1066
00:47:06,639 --> 00:47:15,279
know like the mulch as a as a um Haven

1067
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:18,239
and actually we found that grubs also um

1068
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:21,640
like uh Japanese beetle grubs um Asiatic

1069
00:47:18,239 --> 00:47:24,159
Beetle grubs love mulch so um there's a

1070
00:47:21,639 --> 00:47:26,440
positive a negative but in the long run

1071
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:28,480
um mulch is is a definite positive from

1072
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:31,000
a blueberry standpoint and it's

1073
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:32,559
interesting to note that um blueberries

1074
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:34,920
in New Jersey were never

1075
00:47:32,559 --> 00:47:38,839
mulched um because we had the native

1076
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:42,920
organic matter already High um but after

1077
00:47:38,838 --> 00:47:48,838
Decades of growing blueberries um with

1078
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:51,280
no um um with with the use of herbicides

1079
00:47:48,838 --> 00:47:55,519
and with we rot a till in the mid middle

1080
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:57,519
of the Rose um we have slowly uh burnt

1081
00:47:55,519 --> 00:48:00,400
up our organic matter

1082
00:47:57,519 --> 00:48:03,079
and um the soil test coming back uh five

1083
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:04,318
and six years ago the organic matter was

1084
00:48:03,079 --> 00:48:09,359
often around

1085
00:48:04,318 --> 00:48:10,759
1% um and as a result uh we decided Well

1086
00:48:09,358 --> 00:48:15,759
um you know a lot of the guys is

1087
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:16,880
starting to mulch again and um uh I see

1088
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:20,400
there's a question about uh

1089
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:23,838
incorporating mulch um no I don't like

1090
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:27,039
incorporating mulch um uh what you're

1091
00:48:23,838 --> 00:48:30,960
trying to do is let it break down but um

1092
00:48:27,039 --> 00:48:34,519
um uh the problem with mulch uh any any

1093
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:39,760
uncomposted mulch in the uh rooting Zone

1094
00:48:34,519 --> 00:48:42,759
at all is um that it basically robs the

1095
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:43,960
plant of nutrients uh the microorganisms

1096
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:46,559
spend their time trying to break the

1097
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:49,400
mulch down instead of the fertilizer

1098
00:48:46,559 --> 00:48:52,720
going to the plant so the only thing I

1099
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:55,880
put in a hole um planting hole is

1100
00:48:52,719 --> 00:48:58,239
something like Pete Moss um Pete Moss is

1101
00:48:55,880 --> 00:49:00,160
excellent uh and that is what I really

1102
00:48:58,239 --> 00:49:01,679
would call the Cadillac of materials as

1103
00:49:00,159 --> 00:49:04,519
far as putting in the in the planting

1104
00:49:01,679 --> 00:49:07,318
Hall um and I would never put anything

1105
00:49:04,519 --> 00:49:09,358
that is uh especially not composted in

1106
00:49:07,318 --> 00:49:11,239
the in the planting hole in New Jersey

1107
00:49:09,358 --> 00:49:15,078
we either use Pete Moss

1108
00:49:11,239 --> 00:49:16,879
or um we uh here we have also a

1109
00:49:15,079 --> 00:49:21,559
cranberry industry and we can get

1110
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:24,318
cranberry leaves if you compost them um

1111
00:49:21,559 --> 00:49:26,839
uh usually at least 2 years um then that

1112
00:49:24,318 --> 00:49:29,558
can be put in the planting Hall but um

1113
00:49:26,838 --> 00:49:34,759
it's not a good idea to uh put anything

1114
00:49:29,559 --> 00:49:34,760
raw into um into the root Zone at

1115
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:44,720
all um anyone who's ever seen one of my

1116
00:49:40,599 --> 00:49:46,760
um uh talks any place knows that I often

1117
00:49:44,719 --> 00:49:49,078
say the three most important factors for

1118
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:55,839
successful blueberry growing are pH pH

1119
00:49:49,079 --> 00:49:59,200
and pH um pH is critical um and uh I I I

1120
00:49:55,838 --> 00:50:02,480
believe that from I work that the uh the

1121
00:49:59,199 --> 00:50:04,519
the optimum pH for high bush blares is

1122
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:09,400
about 45 to

1123
00:50:04,519 --> 00:50:11,039
48 um and so if you have a soil um that

1124
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:15,039
you're starting with that is not within

1125
00:50:11,039 --> 00:50:18,519
that range um it needs to be changed um

1126
00:50:15,039 --> 00:50:21,798
to lower pH you add sulfur um to

1127
00:50:18,519 --> 00:50:25,119
increase pH you add lime um the amount

1128
00:50:21,798 --> 00:50:26,838
depends on how uh what your pH is and um

1129
00:50:25,119 --> 00:50:28,798
what your soil type is and that that

1130
00:50:26,838 --> 00:50:33,000
those recommendations you can get from

1131
00:50:28,798 --> 00:50:34,880
um your soil test but um but the the

1132
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:37,639
bottom line is is that uh you have to

1133
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:40,920
change uh the ph and it it is not an

1134
00:50:37,639 --> 00:50:43,118
overnight process um for instance if we

1135
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:45,039
were sitting here right now and and a

1136
00:50:43,119 --> 00:50:49,880
grower calls me up and says well I want

1137
00:50:45,039 --> 00:50:53,440
to plant in the spring my pH is is uh

1138
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:56,480
6.4 um you're not planting in the spring

1139
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:58,318
um and you possibly may be able to plant

1140
00:50:56,480 --> 00:51:01,159
in the fall but in my mind you probably

1141
00:50:58,318 --> 00:51:05,239
should wait till the following season um

1142
00:51:01,159 --> 00:51:08,039
research shows that um it takes about uh

1143
00:51:05,239 --> 00:51:12,000
2 to four months to change the pH but

1144
00:51:08,039 --> 00:51:15,639
the organisms that do this need 70° they

1145
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:18,960
work best at around 70° so um it's if

1146
00:51:15,639 --> 00:51:22,078
you put on sulfur or right now uh

1147
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:25,240
nothing's going to happen to it until um

1148
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:27,359
late spring so as a result uh you put

1149
00:51:25,239 --> 00:51:28,519
the plants in the ground and uh you may

1150
00:51:27,358 --> 00:51:31,920
indeed lose them because they're not

1151
00:51:28,519 --> 00:51:36,280
going to go anywhere um so changing pH

1152
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:39,280
is a slow process and uh I wouldn't rush

1153
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:40,880
into planting if the pH is not correct I

1154
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:43,160
also tell people that if they are going

1155
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:45,519
to grow blueberries they really need to

1156
00:51:43,159 --> 00:51:48,239
go out and get a pH meter that's how

1157
00:51:45,519 --> 00:51:51,519
critical it is because um if your native

1158
00:51:48,239 --> 00:51:53,519
pH is not 4.5 to 4.8 then you should be

1159
00:51:51,519 --> 00:51:56,798
checking your pH Every Spring and every

1160
00:51:53,519 --> 00:51:58,759
fall and um and you know that be

1161
00:51:56,798 --> 00:52:00,280
cumbersome if uh you're you're having to

1162
00:51:58,760 --> 00:52:01,880
run to some lab or something all the

1163
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:03,798
time but if you actually go out there

1164
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:06,798
and take a test and I don't I don't mean

1165
00:52:03,798 --> 00:52:09,239
a pH meter from Home Depot um I you need

1166
00:52:06,798 --> 00:52:10,960
to actually get a good a good pH

1167
00:52:09,239 --> 00:52:15,279
meter

1168
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:17,760
um we as I mentioned we use Pete Moss um

1169
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:20,798
and probably about a 50/50 mix of um

1170
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:22,760
Pete Moss uh and your planting hole it's

1171
00:52:20,798 --> 00:52:25,039
best to use people have asked me well

1172
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:28,000
you bring in the top soil no it's really

1173
00:52:25,039 --> 00:52:31,279
not good to put other top soil in there

1174
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:33,318
it's actually best to use your soil um

1175
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:36,200
because then you have actually a barrier

1176
00:52:33,318 --> 00:52:38,358
between your soil and the top soil if

1177
00:52:36,199 --> 00:52:41,919
you if you've brought it in so uh that's

1178
00:52:38,358 --> 00:52:44,798
not a good thing um so 50/50 mix is Good

1179
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:48,480
Pete Moss usually runs as I understand

1180
00:52:44,798 --> 00:52:52,000
um uh it usually runs of a pH of 3.8 to

1181
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:56,119
around 4.2 4.3 depending on where you're

1182
00:52:52,000 --> 00:53:01,119
getting it so um and that's about the

1183
00:52:56,119 --> 00:53:04,599
best way to go um Pete m is very good

1184
00:53:01,119 --> 00:53:06,798
um well what would be a good pH meter um

1185
00:53:04,599 --> 00:53:11,160
there's a question here um actually I

1186
00:53:06,798 --> 00:53:13,759
get one I use one from um uh Spectrum

1187
00:53:11,159 --> 00:53:15,960
Electronics spectrum and it's called the

1188
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:19,720
pH Pro it runs about

1189
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:23,440
$150 uh I think it's s p c t r u m

1190
00:53:19,719 --> 00:53:25,598
spectrum and electronics and uh I often

1191
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:27,079
put um mention this in in the blueberry

1192
00:53:25,599 --> 00:53:29,519
newsletter and

1193
00:53:27,079 --> 00:53:31,599
um it's about 150 it you can take it out

1194
00:53:29,519 --> 00:53:35,079
the field it's you know about the size

1195
00:53:31,599 --> 00:53:38,798
of a a large pen and that's that makes

1196
00:53:35,079 --> 00:53:41,079
it pretty easy um so uh they they make a

1197
00:53:38,798 --> 00:53:43,719
nice one actually we we did some tests

1198
00:53:41,079 --> 00:53:45,680
trying to find one that is accurate and

1199
00:53:43,719 --> 00:53:48,598
and um reasonably priced and that's the

1200
00:53:45,679 --> 00:53:51,519
one we came up with so pH Pro from

1201
00:53:48,599 --> 00:53:54,000
Spectrum um and then another question is

1202
00:53:51,519 --> 00:53:57,440
if banding sulfur acid in two bands how

1203
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:59,440
much in per acre um

1204
00:53:57,440 --> 00:54:02,240
well I mean actually you you you really

1205
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:05,358
shouldn't ban sulfur

1206
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:07,439
um and I'm not sure exactly what the

1207
00:54:05,358 --> 00:54:09,719
intent of this question was except you

1208
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:11,720
know they were thinking maybe uh putting

1209
00:54:09,719 --> 00:54:14,279
bands down where the plants are if

1210
00:54:11,719 --> 00:54:17,719
you're growing blueberries the entire

1211
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:21,119
area needs to be decreased to um that

1212
00:54:17,719 --> 00:54:22,959
area of 4.5 to 4.8 um people have this

1213
00:54:21,119 --> 00:54:25,280
idea well you you know under the plants

1214
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:29,318
it could be 4.5 and out in the row it'll

1215
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:31,880
be 6.5 no um there's water that moves

1216
00:54:29,318 --> 00:54:35,279
back and forth um there's interaction if

1217
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:37,599
if your middles are 6.5 and and the

1218
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:41,119
under the plant is 4.5 at the beginning

1219
00:54:37,599 --> 00:54:42,680
of the spring by August um under your

1220
00:54:41,119 --> 00:54:47,039
plants are going to be

1221
00:54:42,679 --> 00:54:50,279
58 and so um the entire area needs to be

1222
00:54:47,039 --> 00:54:52,920
taken down so that means Vicon um you

1223
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:55,640
know you can in fact use pel peliz

1224
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:57,680
sulfur if you like but um the entire

1225
00:54:55,639 --> 00:54:59,879
area that you're growing blueberries

1226
00:54:57,679 --> 00:55:05,399
needs to be brought into that optimal

1227
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:08,559
range of pH um and that's that really is

1228
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:11,838
critical um varieties I usually mention

1229
00:55:08,559 --> 00:55:13,680
uh a lot about varieties um and you know

1230
00:55:11,838 --> 00:55:16,279
it's it's not I don't want to make a

1231
00:55:13,679 --> 00:55:18,679
knock on New Jersey but um the number

1232
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:22,760
one criteria for varieties in New Jersey

1233
00:55:18,679 --> 00:55:24,838
is yield um and season okay that would

1234
00:55:22,760 --> 00:55:26,319
be number two so we have we only grow

1235
00:55:24,838 --> 00:55:28,318
three varieties in New Jersey we grow

1236
00:55:26,318 --> 00:55:32,798
grow an early we grow a mid and we grow

1237
00:55:28,318 --> 00:55:37,400
a late our early is Duke our um Mid is

1238
00:55:32,798 --> 00:55:41,038
blue crop and our late is Elliot um and

1239
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:43,599
uh yield is unquestionably the uh the

1240
00:55:41,039 --> 00:55:47,240
top criteria

1241
00:55:43,599 --> 00:55:50,079
um that is uh we really don't care what

1242
00:55:47,239 --> 00:55:52,318
they taste like to tell you the truth um

1243
00:55:50,079 --> 00:55:55,000
and Duke is certainly not a great

1244
00:55:52,318 --> 00:55:58,440
flavored blueberry and Elliott is not

1245
00:55:55,000 --> 00:56:01,599
either um so uh you really have to ask

1246
00:55:58,440 --> 00:56:03,679
yourself what is your top priority um

1247
00:56:01,599 --> 00:56:05,119
the nice thing about uh Elliott it

1248
00:56:03,679 --> 00:56:07,919
doesn't get a whole lot of diseases it's

1249
00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:13,358
very productive uh Duke is is very

1250
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:16,880
productive um but um if if

1251
00:56:13,358 --> 00:56:20,078
uh if you are going to run a picky own

1252
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:23,720
operation it it seems to me that one of

1253
00:56:20,079 --> 00:56:27,000
the uh most important things um is

1254
00:56:23,719 --> 00:56:31,038
Flavor um you know people can go into

1255
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:33,679
the supermarket and buy uh berries from

1256
00:56:31,039 --> 00:56:37,240
all over the world now and often they

1257
00:56:33,679 --> 00:56:39,838
are not that that great flavor um but

1258
00:56:37,239 --> 00:56:43,118
there are wonderful varieties that are

1259
00:56:39,838 --> 00:56:46,159
um available um that are what I would

1260
00:56:43,119 --> 00:56:49,160
call actually Gourmet berries um and

1261
00:56:46,159 --> 00:56:50,639
Gourmet varieties um and they are seldom

1262
00:56:49,159 --> 00:56:53,159
grown but if I had a pick your own

1263
00:56:50,639 --> 00:56:55,318
operation that's the way I would go uh

1264
00:56:53,159 --> 00:56:58,399
what varieties well um one of my

1265
00:56:55,318 --> 00:57:00,079
favorites is Elizabeth Elizabeth is um

1266
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:03,760
easily better than anything on the

1267
00:57:00,079 --> 00:57:08,440
market from a flavor standpoint um is it

1268
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:11,680
um is it uh I going to um crop as high

1269
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:13,720
as blue crop no it isn't but um it's

1270
00:57:11,679 --> 00:57:16,239
it's certainly much better flavored uh

1271
00:57:13,719 --> 00:57:18,239
Elizabeth is named after Elizabeth white

1272
00:57:16,239 --> 00:57:20,679
um Elizabeth white basically started the

1273
00:57:18,239 --> 00:57:23,558
blueberry industry here in New Jersey uh

1274
00:57:20,679 --> 00:57:26,318
it's later than blue crop um one of the

1275
00:57:23,559 --> 00:57:30,880
main reasons why we don't grow it is

1276
00:57:26,318 --> 00:57:34,960
because it is sort of a a growing um uh

1277
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:37,039
plant that is uh a weeping kind of plant

1278
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:38,960
it's not very upright well in New Jersey

1279
00:57:37,039 --> 00:57:41,480
we do a lot of mechanical harvesting and

1280
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:44,280
and a plant that leans over is not not

1281
00:57:41,480 --> 00:57:46,920
really good for mechanical harvesting so

1282
00:57:44,280 --> 00:57:49,039
uh no one grows it here but um it is

1283
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:51,039
available in fact it's available through

1284
00:57:49,039 --> 00:57:54,200
a a um one of the nurseries in New

1285
00:57:51,039 --> 00:57:57,640
Jersey here Ammons and um and it's

1286
00:57:54,199 --> 00:57:59,719
fantastic um a very old variety that's

1287
00:57:57,639 --> 00:58:02,199
early that's wonderful flavored is

1288
00:57:59,719 --> 00:58:04,838
ivanho um excellent that's going to be

1289
00:58:02,199 --> 00:58:06,558
tougher to find but it's uh I I've

1290
00:58:04,838 --> 00:58:08,920
tasted it a few different places now

1291
00:58:06,559 --> 00:58:13,480
it's incredible um some of the new ones

1292
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:15,960
Legacy Darrow um uh D's an older one but

1293
00:58:13,480 --> 00:58:18,679
Legacy uh is an actual flavor this is

1294
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:20,838
later than blue crop um those are all

1295
00:58:18,679 --> 00:58:22,558
good flavor varieties but all I'm saying

1296
00:58:20,838 --> 00:58:24,038
is is that you you really need to kind

1297
00:58:22,559 --> 00:58:26,599
of ask yourself what you're trying to

1298
00:58:24,039 --> 00:58:29,280
put out there and I would I would go for

1299
00:58:26,599 --> 00:58:31,760
varieties if I was do pick your own that

1300
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:35,760
um everybody's going to Rave about and

1301
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:35,760
uh and you can find them they are out

1302
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:43,760
there um this is a a young planting um

1303
00:58:41,599 --> 00:58:45,720
uh in New Jersey here this is what what

1304
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:48,000
it looks like it might be a little dark

1305
00:58:45,719 --> 00:58:50,199
um but again you notice the soils look

1306
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:53,798
very white but again it's it's very

1307
00:58:50,199 --> 00:58:57,960
really high organic matter um uh this is

1308
00:58:53,798 --> 00:59:00,639
an old shot and um I don't see actually

1309
00:58:57,960 --> 00:59:02,358
irrigation um you rarely will find any

1310
00:59:00,639 --> 00:59:05,759
no one New Jersey would put in uh

1311
00:59:02,358 --> 00:59:07,880
planting now without irrigation um uh

1312
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:10,400
all the new plannings are using trickle

1313
00:59:07,880 --> 00:59:15,039
irrigation actually

1314
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:16,400
um and um uh the nice thing is is

1315
00:59:15,039 --> 00:59:20,480
because you can put fertilizer through

1316
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:22,039
the uh through your um trickle um here's

1317
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:24,639
a question about Draper and bonus

1318
00:59:22,039 --> 00:59:26,839
Liberty and Aurora um we haven't tested

1319
00:59:24,639 --> 00:59:31,879
them too much they are in our

1320
00:59:26,838 --> 00:59:34,119
trial um and so we're not using them um

1321
00:59:31,880 --> 00:59:37,680
I've heard I've heard good things about

1322
00:59:34,119 --> 00:59:40,280
Liberty um Aurora is very late uh it may

1323
00:59:37,679 --> 00:59:43,239
be too late for anyone north of New

1324
00:59:40,280 --> 00:59:46,480
Jersey um draer is not quite as late as

1325
00:59:43,239 --> 00:59:49,000
I understand it um I think what uh I

1326
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:52,960
would do is um if I want to look into

1327
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:55,358
these is actually talk to um uh or come

1328
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:58,119
we have a Twilight meeting here at the

1329
00:59:55,358 --> 01:00:03,078
research station in New Jersey and that

1330
00:59:58,119 --> 01:00:05,200
is in um late May um early June and

1331
01:00:03,079 --> 01:00:07,960
actually the main focus of that will be

1332
01:00:05,199 --> 01:00:09,838
to walk through those varieties and uh

1333
01:00:07,960 --> 01:00:13,480
look at the plants and taste The Taste

1334
01:00:09,838 --> 01:00:16,078
the uh uh the fruit so that that would

1335
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:20,159
be available to you also um Draper um

1336
01:00:16,079 --> 01:00:21,640
Aurora were developed in um Michigan um

1337
01:00:20,159 --> 01:00:23,279
you certainly could get information from

1338
01:00:21,639 --> 01:00:26,038
them uh more up-to-date information on

1339
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:28,480
those varieties uh if you'd like to know

1340
01:00:26,039 --> 01:00:28,480
more about

1341
01:00:29,639 --> 01:00:34,679
them um this is the how we this is what

1342
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:40,240
we call solid City

1343
01:00:34,679 --> 01:00:43,838
irrigation um and um uh this is the the

1344
01:00:40,239 --> 01:00:46,038
typical irrigation that we use um it was

1345
01:00:43,838 --> 01:00:48,279
one of the reasons why it was popular

1346
01:00:46,039 --> 01:00:50,039
and uh is still popular in certain

1347
01:00:48,280 --> 01:00:53,680
plantings is that it's also good for

1348
01:00:50,039 --> 01:00:55,480
frost control um there are places in uh

1349
01:00:53,679 --> 01:00:56,558
the pine Barons here that are subject to

1350
01:00:55,480 --> 01:01:00,599
frost

1351
01:00:56,559 --> 01:01:03,319
and uh so we we often uh um in those

1352
01:01:00,599 --> 01:01:06,599
areas uh need this kind of irrigation uh

1353
01:01:03,318 --> 01:01:08,798
for frost control um I haven't seen

1354
01:01:06,599 --> 01:01:11,680
anybody put this kind of irrigation in

1355
01:01:08,798 --> 01:01:14,358
in a long time um I just think uh

1356
01:01:11,679 --> 01:01:16,399
trickle is is is more efficient uh as

1357
01:01:14,358 --> 01:01:18,199
far as use of water and the whole idea

1358
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:21,079
that you can use uh put fertilizer

1359
01:01:18,199 --> 01:01:25,118
through it is is something that that um

1360
01:01:21,079 --> 01:01:25,119
has been found very efficient

1361
01:01:26,239 --> 01:01:31,439
um this is a shot of a blueberry farm up

1362
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:35,559
in Burlington County um Counting north

1363
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:38,280
of where I am and um and you notice all

1364
01:01:35,559 --> 01:01:42,000
the dead leaves on the plants um

1365
01:01:38,280 --> 01:01:46,039
blueberries are not good at all at

1366
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:48,239
competing for water um and in a drought

1367
01:01:46,039 --> 01:01:51,278
situation they can get into big trouble

1368
01:01:48,239 --> 01:01:53,838
without uh irrigation um for some reason

1369
01:01:51,278 --> 01:01:56,519
often the the Burlington County um

1370
01:01:53,838 --> 01:01:59,119
fields did not have irrigation

1371
01:01:56,519 --> 01:02:01,719
or um didn't use it as much as they

1372
01:01:59,119 --> 01:02:03,278
should have and as a result uh they ran

1373
01:02:01,719 --> 01:02:05,519
into a lot of troubles and this was a

1374
01:02:03,278 --> 01:02:06,519
drought um this is back and I believe I

1375
01:02:05,519 --> 01:02:10,119
took this in

1376
01:02:06,519 --> 01:02:13,000
1988 um and this had lots of

1377
01:02:10,119 --> 01:02:14,960
problems and this is what um leaves look

1378
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:17,119
like when they are uh when you're in the

1379
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:19,278
drought situation um you can see the

1380
01:02:17,119 --> 01:02:22,838
dieback of the leaves and certainly this

1381
01:02:19,278 --> 01:02:26,159
will hurt uh the the future uh yields of

1382
01:02:22,838 --> 01:02:29,199
of these plants um you can really hurt

1383
01:02:26,159 --> 01:02:32,838
production um and flower production

1384
01:02:29,199 --> 01:02:34,719
initiation Etc so um you know I would

1385
01:02:32,838 --> 01:02:37,119
never put in a blueberry planning

1386
01:02:34,719 --> 01:02:40,558
without irrigation I just uh it's just

1387
01:02:37,119 --> 01:02:44,318
um uh fool hearted to do

1388
01:02:40,559 --> 01:02:46,599
that um this is an interesting shot here

1389
01:02:44,318 --> 01:02:48,679
and um I wanted to put this in I often

1390
01:02:46,599 --> 01:02:53,000
show this shot uh

1391
01:02:48,679 --> 01:02:54,879
because um it uh it shows you that this

1392
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:58,000
was in Burlington County also and this

1393
01:02:54,880 --> 01:03:01,318
was in also in 19 1988 um during a a

1394
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:03,559
drought and the farmer had uh did not

1395
01:03:01,318 --> 01:03:06,079
have irrigation and he had used

1396
01:03:03,559 --> 01:03:08,000
herbicides and the herbicides went down

1397
01:03:06,079 --> 01:03:09,760
this row and then he ran out of

1398
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:13,440
herbicides about

1399
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:16,559
here and you notice the weeds um along

1400
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:19,880
here on both sides and you notice right

1401
01:03:16,559 --> 01:03:23,240
where the weeds uh start the plants are

1402
01:03:19,880 --> 01:03:27,599
dying um once again showing blueberries

1403
01:03:23,239 --> 01:03:30,919
cannot out compete uh anything for um

1404
01:03:27,599 --> 01:03:33,240
water and nutrients um and as a result

1405
01:03:30,920 --> 01:03:36,240
um that is also why you have to have a

1406
01:03:33,239 --> 01:03:38,639
very good herbicide program or some kind

1407
01:03:36,239 --> 01:03:40,239
of weed control program in blueberries

1408
01:03:38,639 --> 01:03:42,480
because they're just not able to out

1409
01:03:40,239 --> 01:03:43,838
compete other crops um they they're one

1410
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:46,159
of the only crops that I know of that

1411
01:03:43,838 --> 01:03:50,038
have do not have root hairs um they are

1412
01:03:46,159 --> 01:03:51,920
shallow rooted and um and as a result uh

1413
01:03:50,039 --> 01:03:54,720
you know they they if you don't have

1414
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:56,960
irrigation you and you have weeds there

1415
01:03:54,719 --> 01:03:59,199
um most of what is out there water and

1416
01:03:56,960 --> 01:04:01,880
nutrient it's going to be picked up by

1417
01:03:59,199 --> 01:04:05,358
um by the weeds not the blueberry plants

1418
01:04:01,880 --> 01:04:08,798
so again it's critical um there's a

1419
01:04:05,358 --> 01:04:12,960
question here about landscape fabric um

1420
01:04:08,798 --> 01:04:17,519
we um we had a grower that has have has

1421
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:20,679
uh tried that um they ran into problems

1422
01:04:17,519 --> 01:04:24,038
with it um it seems like a a good match

1423
01:04:20,679 --> 01:04:26,558
but um they they ran into problems they

1424
01:04:24,039 --> 01:04:28,880
the growth was not there

1425
01:04:26,559 --> 01:04:30,599
uh with it and it's something that I

1426
01:04:28,880 --> 01:04:35,318
think we I need to look into a little

1427
01:04:30,599 --> 01:04:37,920
more but um uh he was very hot on the

1428
01:04:35,318 --> 01:04:43,199
idea for a while um it was he came from

1429
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:45,200
a vegetable background and um and he

1430
01:04:43,199 --> 01:04:47,798
basically ran into so many problems with

1431
01:04:45,199 --> 01:04:51,278
with growth uh of the plants that he uh

1432
01:04:47,798 --> 01:04:53,038
tore up the uh landscape praic so um

1433
01:04:51,278 --> 01:04:56,239
there are areas other areas of the world

1434
01:04:53,039 --> 01:04:58,559
that are using that I know um

1435
01:04:56,239 --> 01:05:01,439
uh I was just down in Chile and uh in

1436
01:04:58,559 --> 01:05:05,760
Chile they they do use it um pretty

1437
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:07,838
extensively um but um I think that the

1438
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:09,680
you know it's the the jury is out on

1439
01:05:07,838 --> 01:05:11,400
that one yet um from a high Bush

1440
01:05:09,679 --> 01:05:14,798
blueberry standpoint I think there more

1441
01:05:11,400 --> 01:05:14,798
work needs to be really done on that

1442
01:05:15,358 --> 01:05:21,038
one we don't use it at all in

1443
01:05:18,119 --> 01:05:23,000
Jersey um I wanted to move to a little

1444
01:05:21,039 --> 01:05:26,640
bit uh more into

1445
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:28,920
fertilization um and uh we have done an

1446
01:05:26,639 --> 01:05:32,078
awful lot of with fertilization uh over

1447
01:05:28,920 --> 01:05:35,318
the last 10 years um we've increased

1448
01:05:32,079 --> 01:05:38,200
yields dramatically and um you notice on

1449
01:05:35,318 --> 01:05:42,000
this on this list here

1450
01:05:38,199 --> 01:05:45,759
um jump jump the slide here um and that

1451
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:48,199
is that um as I mentioned we we monitor

1452
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:52,559
um uh we monitor

1453
01:05:48,199 --> 01:05:55,358
pH um all the time um we do an annual

1454
01:05:52,559 --> 01:05:57,119
Leaf analysis uh we Monitor and correct

1455
01:05:55,358 --> 01:05:59,880
any nutrient deficiencies so we really

1456
01:05:57,119 --> 01:06:02,720
are trying to get it to grow uh the

1457
01:05:59,880 --> 01:06:04,720
plant as efficient as possible uh we

1458
01:06:02,719 --> 01:06:06,199
apply fertilizer at the most efficient

1459
01:06:04,719 --> 01:06:08,919
time for uptake I'll mention that a

1460
01:06:06,199 --> 01:06:12,318
little bit later and we prune correctly

1461
01:06:08,920 --> 01:06:15,079
all of these things have uh greatly

1462
01:06:12,318 --> 01:06:19,079
increased yields here um you notice in '

1463
01:06:15,079 --> 01:06:22,720
94 um we went from 4,000 lb to 22,000 lb

1464
01:06:19,079 --> 01:06:25,278
in many fields um so that is a dramatic

1465
01:06:22,719 --> 01:06:26,598
increase um and people flat out have

1466
01:06:25,278 --> 01:06:28,559
said that they've gotten two and three

1467
01:06:26,599 --> 01:06:32,160
time uh increases in yield so how have

1468
01:06:28,559 --> 01:06:35,599
we done this um well uh years ago in '

1469
01:06:32,159 --> 01:06:39,480
94 uh we took samples of the best fields

1470
01:06:35,599 --> 01:06:43,760
and uh 39 samples and what we found was

1471
01:06:39,480 --> 01:06:48,358
that um we had deficiencies of all kinds

1472
01:06:43,760 --> 01:06:49,880
and and all these fields and uh and we

1473
01:06:48,358 --> 01:06:54,278
realized well we've got a problem here

1474
01:06:49,880 --> 01:06:56,119
we really do have a problem um and and

1475
01:06:54,278 --> 01:06:59,760
what we also found was that if you take

1476
01:06:56,119 --> 01:07:03,160
a soil test uh which is this above above

1477
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:04,880
test and you take a leaf analysis that

1478
01:07:03,159 --> 01:07:07,038
um there is actually no correlation

1479
01:07:04,880 --> 01:07:09,559
between these two tests and these two

1480
01:07:07,039 --> 01:07:11,359
tests were taken from the same plant

1481
01:07:09,559 --> 01:07:13,039
you'll notice for instance in phosphorus

1482
01:07:11,358 --> 01:07:15,960
on the leaf analysis this phosphorus

1483
01:07:13,039 --> 01:07:20,079
level here is extremely high yet the

1484
01:07:15,960 --> 01:07:22,358
phosphorus down here is just fine um and

1485
01:07:20,079 --> 01:07:24,839
soil analysis of the up here of

1486
01:07:22,358 --> 01:07:28,159
potassium is low in the soil but the

1487
01:07:24,838 --> 01:07:31,278
potassium um down here is actually in

1488
01:07:28,159 --> 01:07:33,239
the excessive level so what we realize

1489
01:07:31,278 --> 01:07:35,278
now is is that there no there is no

1490
01:07:33,239 --> 01:07:36,919
correlation between the soil analysis

1491
01:07:35,278 --> 01:07:40,838
and the leaf analysis and

1492
01:07:36,920 --> 01:07:43,920
blueberries um so as a result we have

1493
01:07:40,838 --> 01:07:47,000
changed how we make recommendations we

1494
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:51,119
do not use soil analysis anymore um we

1495
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:56,159
totally uh base our um fertilizer

1496
01:07:51,119 --> 01:07:57,838
recommendations um uh with a uh uh Leaf

1497
01:07:56,159 --> 01:08:03,879
analysis the only thing we really look

1498
01:07:57,838 --> 01:08:05,599
at a soil analysis for is a um pH I'd

1499
01:08:03,880 --> 01:08:07,880
like to see the organic matter content

1500
01:08:05,599 --> 01:08:09,880
if that's possible but um that's the

1501
01:08:07,880 --> 01:08:12,358
only thing I really want to get from it

1502
01:08:09,880 --> 01:08:14,519
um otherwise all of it is based on uh

1503
01:08:12,358 --> 01:08:15,798
Leaf analysis and we have these the

1504
01:08:14,519 --> 01:08:17,439
chart in front of you is nutrient

1505
01:08:15,798 --> 01:08:19,759
concentration and blueberry leaves we

1506
01:08:17,439 --> 01:08:22,000
have we do know the levels of uh

1507
01:08:19,759 --> 01:08:23,238
sufficient levels of these nutrients so

1508
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:26,198
we can make

1509
01:08:23,238 --> 01:08:28,718
recommendations um this slide effect on

1510
01:08:26,198 --> 01:08:30,439
nitrogen uptake um and this is what we

1511
01:08:28,719 --> 01:08:34,279
do get from the soil test this is the

1512
01:08:30,439 --> 01:08:38,960
exact same field oh let me put that back

1513
01:08:34,279 --> 01:08:44,719
um this is the exact same field um but

1514
01:08:38,960 --> 01:08:48,640
this field on top the pH is at uh 3.5

1515
01:08:44,719 --> 01:08:50,560
and the field down here is at 4.5 and

1516
01:08:48,640 --> 01:08:52,960
all we did was change the pH put the

1517
01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:56,000
exact same bit of nitrogen on and you

1518
01:08:52,960 --> 01:08:59,960
notice this top line here is nit nren is

1519
01:08:56,000 --> 01:09:04,079
deficient in this 3.5 but in 4.5 it is

1520
01:08:59,960 --> 01:09:06,759
in the normal range so um again the the

1521
01:09:04,079 --> 01:09:08,719
nutrients are there but the pH because

1522
01:09:06,759 --> 01:09:11,198
of pH the blueberry plant is just not

1523
01:09:08,719 --> 01:09:13,000
able to pick up um the nutrients and

1524
01:09:11,198 --> 01:09:14,559
that's something to understand now of

1525
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:16,479
course you could put more nitrogen on it

1526
01:09:14,560 --> 01:09:19,400
to make that to make up for that but the

1527
01:09:16,479 --> 01:09:21,798
problem is is that that cost you more

1528
01:09:19,399 --> 01:09:24,198
money and PH does affect the

1529
01:09:21,798 --> 01:09:27,759
availability of all nutrients here's the

1530
01:09:24,198 --> 01:09:30,079
range here of for 3.5 to 6.5 and you

1531
01:09:27,759 --> 01:09:33,520
notice that a lower pH these nutrients

1532
01:09:30,079 --> 01:09:36,399
are more available malum isn't but it is

1533
01:09:33,520 --> 01:09:38,000
uh these are all more available um and

1534
01:09:36,399 --> 01:09:42,198
the main thing to know is is though that

1535
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:42,198
pH affects um nutrient

1536
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:50,000
availability um this is iron chlorosis

1537
01:09:48,119 --> 01:09:52,238
in blueberries um if you have

1538
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:54,359
blueberries you've probably seen this um

1539
01:09:52,238 --> 01:09:58,319
this is actually a good thing because

1540
01:09:54,359 --> 01:10:01,679
iron chlorosis is 99% of the time due to

1541
01:09:58,319 --> 01:10:03,719
high pH not a lack of iron um so it's

1542
01:10:01,679 --> 01:10:06,760
almost an indicator plant that you you

1543
01:10:03,719 --> 01:10:09,760
are not monitoring your field right um

1544
01:10:06,760 --> 01:10:13,480
that you you're you have no pH meter or

1545
01:10:09,760 --> 01:10:16,800
you're just not using it um and so this

1546
01:10:13,479 --> 01:10:18,319
is very good okay um so it's very

1547
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:20,840
important to to

1548
01:10:18,319 --> 01:10:24,039
notice um this is a blueberry plant in

1549
01:10:20,840 --> 01:10:25,319
the wrong pH um these are the roots when

1550
01:10:24,039 --> 01:10:27,279
it was planted you notice they did

1551
01:10:25,319 --> 01:10:30,719
didn't grow and the only reason why this

1552
01:10:27,279 --> 01:10:34,119
plant grew at all was because the the um

1553
01:10:30,719 --> 01:10:36,560
the field was mulched and The Roots grew

1554
01:10:34,119 --> 01:10:39,158
but again you could see that because the

1555
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:43,320
pH was off these roots did nothing and

1556
01:10:39,158 --> 01:10:43,319
again showing you that how important pH

1557
01:10:43,560 --> 01:10:49,039
is um the pH uh sorry the fertilization

1558
01:10:46,920 --> 01:10:52,039
used to be done when when blueberries

1559
01:10:49,039 --> 01:10:53,800
were dormant um we have done research

1560
01:10:52,039 --> 01:10:55,960
now and we know that that is not the

1561
01:10:53,800 --> 01:10:58,400
right time to do uh

1562
01:10:55,960 --> 01:11:01,840
uh fertilization of blueberries the old

1563
01:10:58,399 --> 01:11:03,399
method uh was dormant and petal fall we

1564
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:06,360
now realize that the new method should

1565
01:11:03,399 --> 01:11:08,960
be Bud break and 6 weeks later um the

1566
01:11:06,359 --> 01:11:10,559
blueberry plant almost works like uh

1567
01:11:08,960 --> 01:11:12,920
when you're drinking a soda and you put

1568
01:11:10,560 --> 01:11:15,480
a straw in the soda when you suck on the

1569
01:11:12,920 --> 01:11:17,119
straw the soda comes up from the bottom

1570
01:11:15,479 --> 01:11:20,079
when the when the buds break on a

1571
01:11:17,119 --> 01:11:22,279
blueberry plant it pulls the nutrients

1572
01:11:20,079 --> 01:11:23,719
in up from the root um so if you're

1573
01:11:22,279 --> 01:11:26,920
putting fertilizer out there when the

1574
01:11:23,719 --> 01:11:30,399
blueberry is dormant um it's a waste of

1575
01:11:26,920 --> 01:11:33,039
money and so uh you need to wait wait

1576
01:11:30,399 --> 01:11:35,158
till Bud break to put fertilizer out

1577
01:11:33,039 --> 01:11:38,279
there and well these are the treatments

1578
01:11:35,158 --> 01:11:40,679
that we did um this was dormant uh the

1579
01:11:38,279 --> 01:11:42,920
first one was dormant and the new was

1580
01:11:40,679 --> 01:11:46,319
when we had Bud bre but we also did a

1581
01:11:42,920 --> 01:11:49,279
trickle appar uh um trickle treatment

1582
01:11:46,319 --> 01:11:51,359
where we also the trickle was used uh

1583
01:11:49,279 --> 01:11:53,840
when the plants were Bud break also just

1584
01:11:51,359 --> 01:11:56,238
to see if how that would affect um

1585
01:11:53,840 --> 01:11:59,079
blueberry yields

1586
01:11:56,238 --> 01:12:01,519
and um suffice it to say that this is

1587
01:11:59,079 --> 01:12:05,079
the data from it and the difference

1588
01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:09,960
between the old and the new uh was a 21%

1589
01:12:05,079 --> 01:12:11,920
increase in yield um and we got a 10%

1590
01:12:09,960 --> 01:12:14,319
increase even more than that with the

1591
01:12:11,920 --> 01:12:18,679
use of trickle so we didn't spend any

1592
01:12:14,319 --> 01:12:22,599
more money um putting in um uh the

1593
01:12:18,679 --> 01:12:25,639
fertilizer later we just said okay um

1594
01:12:22,600 --> 01:12:28,920
we're going to put it in later and as a

1595
01:12:25,639 --> 01:12:32,639
result we greatly increased um the the

1596
01:12:28,920 --> 01:12:35,279
uh use of um uh the yields that we got

1597
01:12:32,639 --> 01:12:36,960
and um I mean this was dramatic and

1598
01:12:35,279 --> 01:12:40,198
actually many Growers have told me that

1599
01:12:36,960 --> 01:12:42,039
they have doubled yield um with uh this

1600
01:12:40,198 --> 01:12:43,599
kind of fertilizer regime and then

1601
01:12:42,039 --> 01:12:45,560
moving to trickle that they have

1602
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:49,920
actually doubled yields and even more

1603
01:12:45,560 --> 01:12:51,199
than doubled in many cases um I see a

1604
01:12:49,920 --> 01:12:52,600
couple questions here but I'm going to

1605
01:12:51,198 --> 01:12:55,719
see if I can get through this and I'll

1606
01:12:52,600 --> 01:12:57,880
get back to you if that's okay

1607
01:12:55,719 --> 01:13:01,800
uh because we're back um near the

1608
01:12:57,880 --> 01:13:03,880
conclusion so um as a result all

1609
01:13:01,800 --> 01:13:06,199
fertilizer recommendations are based on

1610
01:13:03,880 --> 01:13:08,520
Leaf analysis um you have to get a leaf

1611
01:13:06,198 --> 01:13:10,719
of analysis if you're going to um make

1612
01:13:08,520 --> 01:13:13,239
some decisions as far as um

1613
01:13:10,719 --> 01:13:16,639
fertilization the pH is modeled

1614
01:13:13,238 --> 01:13:20,279
monitored annually um the optimum is 4.5

1615
01:13:16,639 --> 01:13:21,840
which 4.8 fero application is later uh

1616
01:13:20,279 --> 01:13:24,319
it's more efficient and you get higher

1617
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:26,039
yields and in in in uh in effect you get

1618
01:13:24,319 --> 01:13:27,960
firmer fruit it's data that I didn't

1619
01:13:26,039 --> 01:13:30,238
show you but um it's uh you do get

1620
01:13:27,960 --> 01:13:32,000
firmer fruit and if you can fertilize

1621
01:13:30,238 --> 01:13:35,359
through your trickle irrigation you

1622
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:37,439
actually can get even higher yields and

1623
01:13:35,359 --> 01:13:39,960
uh which which uh you know which is what

1624
01:13:37,439 --> 01:13:39,960
you're trying to

1625
01:13:40,520 --> 01:13:47,360
do um um Sonia mentioned our blueberry

1626
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:49,920
bulletin um we do not send this out as

1627
01:13:47,359 --> 01:13:52,319
an email but this is the uh address of

1628
01:13:49,920 --> 01:13:54,440
the blueberry bulletin it's free it

1629
01:13:52,319 --> 01:13:55,719
comes out weekly from March through uh

1630
01:13:54,439 --> 01:13:58,559
September

1631
01:13:55,719 --> 01:14:00,679
um if uh you go on you can just uh

1632
01:13:58,560 --> 01:14:02,560
download it and pull it up and it's free

1633
01:14:00,679 --> 01:14:04,800
of charge the other thing is I put my

1634
01:14:02,560 --> 01:14:07,560
email on here and if you have any

1635
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:12,119
questions after this is over um I

1636
01:14:07,560 --> 01:14:13,440
certainly will answer uh your emails um

1637
01:14:12,119 --> 01:14:15,639
uh there's a couple questions I don't

1638
01:14:13,439 --> 01:14:20,879
know I I'll try to to do

1639
01:14:15,639 --> 01:14:20,880
those um Laura do I have time for

1640
01:14:21,920 --> 01:14:30,880
questions okay um let's see uh how do

1641
01:14:27,319 --> 01:14:35,198
you fix nutrient deficiencies well um if

1642
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:40,039
you do a leaf analysis um then you know

1643
01:14:35,198 --> 01:14:44,759
uh what what you uh are deficient in um

1644
01:14:40,039 --> 01:14:48,800
and an NPK is classically um uh a

1645
01:14:44,760 --> 01:14:50,560
granular fertilizer that you put down um

1646
01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:51,760
uh that's one way to do it uh we

1647
01:14:50,560 --> 01:14:55,080
actually can also put it through the

1648
01:14:51,760 --> 01:14:58,719
trickle as I mentioned um micronutrient

1649
01:14:55,079 --> 01:15:01,920
deficiencies are usually um done from a

1650
01:14:58,719 --> 01:15:05,760
foler standpoint and they they certainly

1651
01:15:01,920 --> 01:15:07,639
can do that um and so they pretty easy

1652
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:08,800
to actually fix a nutrient deficiency

1653
01:15:07,639 --> 01:15:10,359
it's just that you got to know they're

1654
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:13,400
there the other thing is is that

1655
01:15:10,359 --> 01:15:16,679
micronutrients are critical but the only

1656
01:15:13,399 --> 01:15:19,399
time you add um micronutrients is when

1657
01:15:16,679 --> 01:15:21,760
you know that you are deficient in them

1658
01:15:19,399 --> 01:15:23,519
so um you know you can get into trouble

1659
01:15:21,760 --> 01:15:26,079
just as much trouble with too much as

1660
01:15:23,520 --> 01:15:30,120
too little

1661
01:15:26,079 --> 01:15:30,119
um let's see

1662
01:15:35,679 --> 01:15:42,399
um treatments of those of others growing

1663
01:15:38,399 --> 01:15:45,039
organically um well um certainly you

1664
01:15:42,399 --> 01:15:47,399
still try to time uh there's so many

1665
01:15:45,039 --> 01:15:49,760
different sources of uh fertilizer from

1666
01:15:47,399 --> 01:15:53,679
an organic standpoint but timing is

1667
01:15:49,760 --> 01:15:55,280
still something that is critical um and

1668
01:15:53,679 --> 01:15:57,520
we have some grows in New Jersey that

1669
01:15:55,279 --> 01:15:59,359
are organic uh the thing is is that you

1670
01:15:57,520 --> 01:16:02,080
still want to time it so that the

1671
01:15:59,359 --> 01:16:05,719
fertilizer release is

1672
01:16:02,079 --> 01:16:07,519
um is uh time for when you have Bud

1673
01:16:05,719 --> 01:16:09,960
break and the other thing that you don't

1674
01:16:07,520 --> 01:16:11,520
want to do is to have such a slow

1675
01:16:09,960 --> 01:16:12,800
release of fertilizer which is the

1676
01:16:11,520 --> 01:16:15,040
bigger problem from an organic

1677
01:16:12,800 --> 01:16:17,119
standpoint that you are still releasing

1678
01:16:15,039 --> 01:16:20,000
fertilizer late in the summer and the

1679
01:16:17,119 --> 01:16:23,439
fall um so you're trying to time that

1680
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:25,600
fertilizer for that especially for that

1681
01:16:23,439 --> 01:16:28,479
6 we period from

1682
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:31,760
um uh Bud break till in New Jersey it

1683
01:16:28,479 --> 01:16:33,119
would be till uh late June so it really

1684
01:16:31,760 --> 01:16:35,079
depends on the fertilizer that you're

1685
01:16:33,119 --> 01:16:37,439
using from an organic standpoint but

1686
01:16:35,079 --> 01:16:39,600
keep that in mind when you're applying

1687
01:16:37,439 --> 01:16:42,479
it or getting a source of organic

1688
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:44,159
fertilizer um from organic standpoint

1689
01:16:42,479 --> 01:16:49,718
that you're trying to still time it for

1690
01:16:44,158 --> 01:16:49,719
that that uh critical time

1691
01:16:52,399 --> 01:16:56,399
um right

1692
01:17:03,158 --> 01:17:08,599
um when we um when we put mulch down on

1693
01:17:06,560 --> 01:17:11,920
now I'm talking specifically on top of

1694
01:17:08,600 --> 01:17:16,199
the ground um no it really doesn't have

1695
01:17:11,920 --> 01:17:19,440
to be um aged um it will do it will do

1696
01:17:16,198 --> 01:17:21,919
better for your planting if it's aged um

1697
01:17:19,439 --> 01:17:25,719
and in fact if it if you actually have

1698
01:17:21,920 --> 01:17:29,000
composted your mulch um it will be

1699
01:17:25,719 --> 01:17:30,439
easier to uh deal with fertilization of

1700
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:33,319
your plants because one of the things

1701
01:17:30,439 --> 01:17:34,879
about raw Mulch on top is that people

1702
01:17:33,319 --> 01:17:37,719
ask me well do you have to increase your

1703
01:17:34,880 --> 01:17:39,440
fertilization rate yes you do uh then

1704
01:17:37,719 --> 01:17:42,198
they next question invariably is well

1705
01:17:39,439 --> 01:17:44,319
how much there's no way to know that um

1706
01:17:42,198 --> 01:17:47,279
depending on the

1707
01:17:44,319 --> 01:17:49,759
composting uh stage and the kind of

1708
01:17:47,279 --> 01:17:52,399
compost that you have or mols that you

1709
01:17:49,760 --> 01:17:55,800
have it's it's impossible to tell you

1710
01:17:52,399 --> 01:17:58,599
how much it can be up to twice as much

1711
01:17:55,800 --> 01:18:01,600
um and but if that if that mulch is

1712
01:17:58,600 --> 01:18:05,840
actually composted already um and and

1713
01:18:01,600 --> 01:18:08,280
broken down then um the increase is is

1714
01:18:05,840 --> 01:18:10,920
minimal um and you will get the best

1715
01:18:08,279 --> 01:18:13,960
benefit from an organic standpoint um

1716
01:18:10,920 --> 01:18:16,199
for your planning um and as far as wood

1717
01:18:13,960 --> 01:18:20,039
chips or Hardwoods um no I don't believe

1718
01:18:16,198 --> 01:18:21,519
there's a difference uh a big um uh a

1719
01:18:20,039 --> 01:18:23,039
benefit of one over the other like I

1720
01:18:21,520 --> 01:18:24,800
said the best benefit is just finding

1721
01:18:23,039 --> 01:18:27,800
one you can get for the least amount of

1722
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:31,079
price if you're near a sawmill and you

1723
01:18:27,800 --> 01:18:32,480
know they use specifically Pine and uh

1724
01:18:31,079 --> 01:18:35,479
they'll give you the chips that's the

1725
01:18:32,479 --> 01:18:38,638
one you want um I've never seen any work

1726
01:18:35,479 --> 01:18:40,959
showing one one or the other TI truth um

1727
01:18:38,639 --> 01:18:43,400
it's just that uh Hardwoods will usually

1728
01:18:40,960 --> 01:18:45,760
break down slower um if you're going to

1729
01:18:43,399 --> 01:18:47,960
compost them they'll break down slower

1730
01:18:45,760 --> 01:18:50,079
um Pine will usually break down faster

1731
01:18:47,960 --> 01:18:52,800
so you know those are those are kind of

1732
01:18:50,079 --> 01:18:58,679
the um uh things that you have to think

1733
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:58,679
about um let's see

1734
01:19:13,158 --> 01:19:18,039
um well the the one that we use in New

1735
01:19:16,279 --> 01:19:20,359
Jersey as far as going through the

1736
01:19:18,039 --> 01:19:24,479
trickle irrigation is um one called

1737
01:19:20,359 --> 01:19:26,639
plant food ink plant food ink and that

1738
01:19:24,479 --> 01:19:28,399
is somebody that uh we use pretty

1739
01:19:26,639 --> 01:19:32,960
effectively uh they were actually part

1740
01:19:28,399 --> 01:19:34,920
of our research um they're uh they have

1741
01:19:32,960 --> 01:19:37,520
actually fertilizers specifically for

1742
01:19:34,920 --> 01:19:40,039
blueberries and specifically for trickle

1743
01:19:37,520 --> 01:19:42,880
irrigation so they've done a great job

1744
01:19:40,039 --> 01:19:48,920
of that kind of thing um the ratio of

1745
01:19:42,880 --> 01:19:51,480
NPK um really depends on um on the uh on

1746
01:19:48,920 --> 01:19:55,039
your soil test uh and your Leaf analysis

1747
01:19:51,479 --> 01:19:57,959
that you get back um you know uh the the

1748
01:19:55,039 --> 01:20:02,600
standard thing used to be a 10 101 uh

1749
01:19:57,960 --> 01:20:05,679
600 lb of the acre um and uh which would

1750
01:20:02,600 --> 01:20:09,120
give you 60 lbs actual nitrogen but uh

1751
01:20:05,679 --> 01:20:10,719
that's only a place to start until you

1752
01:20:09,119 --> 01:20:14,119
um get up and running from a leaf

1753
01:20:10,719 --> 01:20:16,920
analysis standpoint um from then on it's

1754
01:20:14,119 --> 01:20:18,920
it's uh the the tweaking of how much the

1755
01:20:16,920 --> 01:20:22,679
ratio would be between NPK is totally

1756
01:20:18,920 --> 01:20:24,399
dependent on your Leaf analysis okay um

1757
01:20:22,679 --> 01:20:27,639
there's a question about sawdust versus

1758
01:20:24,399 --> 01:20:29,920
wood ships um uh again if that's what

1759
01:20:27,639 --> 01:20:33,960
you can get great I have no problem with

1760
01:20:29,920 --> 01:20:36,319
sawdust um uh it will break down faster

1761
01:20:33,960 --> 01:20:38,800
um which can be a good thing for the

1762
01:20:36,319 --> 01:20:40,960
plants but you'll have to replace it um

1763
01:20:38,800 --> 01:20:44,199
more often

1764
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:46,560
um um Walnut yeah I've heard walnuts can

1765
01:20:44,198 --> 01:20:51,638
be dangerous because they could they

1766
01:20:46,560 --> 01:20:53,960
could uh Supply um toxins um somehow I

1767
01:20:51,639 --> 01:20:56,079
doubt you'd ever be able to get walnut

1768
01:20:53,960 --> 01:20:58,960
because of the price of that would but

1769
01:20:56,079 --> 01:21:01,840
um but I but I've I would steer away

1770
01:20:58,960 --> 01:21:04,600
from them I think um from a walnut

1771
01:21:01,840 --> 01:21:06,760
standpoint have this are there any more

1772
01:21:04,600 --> 01:21:08,880
questions weinar up on there so you can

1773
01:21:06,760 --> 01:21:12,119
go back through and listen to it and

1774
01:21:08,880 --> 01:21:15,159
you'll be able to pause it on that slide

1775
01:21:12,119 --> 01:21:18,000
um I also want to let folks know that a

1776
01:21:15,158 --> 01:21:19,599
lot of lot of lot of information is also

1777
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:22,439
available in the hi highbush blueberry

1778
01:21:19,600 --> 01:21:25,159
production guide by enr some of that uh

1779
01:21:22,439 --> 01:21:28,719
nutritional information is there

1780
01:21:25,158 --> 01:21:31,198
and uh if you get onto um Dr Pav's

1781
01:21:28,719 --> 01:21:34,439
blueberry bulletin you can get some of

1782
01:21:31,198 --> 01:21:35,839
this information and all of that um

1783
01:21:34,439 --> 01:21:37,638
those links and everything will be on

1784
01:21:35,840 --> 01:21:42,520
this webinar when it's

1785
01:21:37,639 --> 01:21:42,520
archived so uh be

1786
01:21:58,600 --> 01:22:03,239
um La I might make a comment about um

1787
01:22:01,198 --> 01:22:07,238
there was a comment about the pro drib

1788
01:22:03,238 --> 01:22:10,119
use by uh Sonia was asking me um and New

1789
01:22:07,238 --> 01:22:13,399
Jersey does use prib in bad

1790
01:22:10,119 --> 01:22:15,760
years um and but I think the most

1791
01:22:13,399 --> 01:22:19,198
important and it is effective but I

1792
01:22:15,760 --> 01:22:23,360
would all just uh mention that it you

1793
01:22:19,198 --> 01:22:26,000
have to be sure that your pollination is

1794
01:22:23,359 --> 01:22:28,519
um not doing well before using Pro drip

1795
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:31,800
because once you put the pro drip on you

1796
01:22:28,520 --> 01:22:35,120
you cannot pollinate naturally anymore

1797
01:22:31,800 --> 01:22:37,400
so proj does uh result in smaller

1798
01:22:35,119 --> 01:22:39,479
berries and later berries but so I

1799
01:22:37,399 --> 01:22:41,519
wouldn't use it unless I'm sure that you

1800
01:22:39,479 --> 01:22:43,759
know your pollination is not doing as

1801
01:22:41,520 --> 01:22:45,239
well as it could have does anybody else

1802
01:22:43,760 --> 01:22:47,679
have any other question um there's a

1803
01:22:45,238 --> 01:22:50,079
question about uh when to when do I

1804
01:22:47,679 --> 01:22:52,679
recommend leaf and El in New Jersey we

1805
01:22:50,079 --> 01:22:55,479
basically say when blue crop has

1806
01:22:52,679 --> 01:22:58,960
finished which is basically the the end

1807
01:22:55,479 --> 01:23:02,119
of July Tom or wh that one particular

1808
01:22:58,960 --> 01:23:03,520
end of July slide but uh oh wait a

1809
01:23:02,119 --> 01:23:05,479
minute there's one more question here if

1810
01:23:03,520 --> 01:23:08,400
you have a rain and can't fertig gate

1811
01:23:05,479 --> 01:23:12,399
what method can you fertilize

1812
01:23:08,399 --> 01:23:12,399
overhead scary

1813
01:23:29,960 --> 01:23:35,239
if you have a rain and can't ferate well

1814
01:23:33,158 --> 01:23:37,399
ferate is through your trickle so you

1815
01:23:35,238 --> 01:23:40,279
can do that in rain or no

1816
01:23:37,399 --> 01:23:42,238
rain um I'm not sure what that what

1817
01:23:40,279 --> 01:23:45,479
method can you fertilize

1818
01:23:42,238 --> 01:23:47,919
overhead oh

1819
01:23:45,479 --> 01:23:51,039
um I'm not sure what that what that

1820
01:23:47,920 --> 01:23:53,399
question means tell you the truth um

1821
01:23:51,039 --> 01:23:55,719
what method can you fertilize over cuz

1822
01:23:53,399 --> 01:23:58,719
we don't we we don't fertilize through

1823
01:23:55,719 --> 01:24:01,359
the through our um solid City

1824
01:23:58,719 --> 01:24:05,800
irrigation um you know it's either it's

1825
01:24:01,359 --> 01:24:07,439
either a ped App application or it's um

1826
01:24:05,800 --> 01:24:09,760
for the rest of you thank you so much

winter moth so I hope that uh you will

1841
01:24:46,520 --> 01:24:53,480
join us and Robert sure oh

1842
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:04,118
Laura if I can butt in here um there's a

1843
01:25:02,800 --> 01:25:06,360
there's a couple questions one is

1844
01:25:04,118 --> 01:25:08,599
someone asked about ammonium nitrate

1845
01:25:06,359 --> 01:25:11,238
should it be applied over the mulch or

1846
01:25:08,600 --> 01:25:14,639
should it be incorporated the answer is

1847
01:25:11,238 --> 01:25:17,839
no no in that you never use aluminum

1848
01:25:14,639 --> 01:25:20,480
ammonium nitrate in blueberries never

1849
01:25:17,840 --> 01:25:23,480
because nitrate is is not a form of

1850
01:25:20,479 --> 01:25:25,879
nitrogen that blueberries can uptake so

1851
01:25:23,479 --> 01:25:28,359
you use Ammon forms of nitrogen and you

1852
01:25:25,880 --> 01:25:30,520
use ammonium sulfate if your pH is high

1853
01:25:28,359 --> 01:25:33,238
but you never use ammonium nitrate in

1854
01:25:30,520 --> 01:25:35,560
blueberries okay because the nitrate pot

1855
01:25:33,238 --> 01:25:37,559
is actually toxic to blueberries and and

1856
01:25:35,560 --> 01:25:40,520
you're paying for that nitrogen sauce

1857
01:25:37,560 --> 01:25:42,480
and uh and you don't use it you can't

1858
01:25:40,520 --> 01:25:45,760
need it you don't need it and it's not

1859
01:25:42,479 --> 01:25:47,839
being used so never use ammonium nitrate

1860
01:25:45,760 --> 01:25:49,159
and um and then the other question is

1861
01:25:47,840 --> 01:25:50,679
how do you distributed the pelleted

1862
01:25:49,158 --> 01:25:54,079
fertilizer the fertilizer is put

1863
01:25:50,679 --> 01:25:56,840
underneath the plants not in the row um

1864
01:25:54,079 --> 01:25:59,800
and and um what the blueberry guys here

1865
01:25:56,840 --> 01:26:01,520
have is a Vicon that is directed in

1866
01:25:59,800 --> 01:26:04,440
other words rather than going all over

1867
01:26:01,520 --> 01:26:06,119
the back uh there's a there's a guard on

1868
01:26:04,439 --> 01:26:08,559
there that makes it just go underneath

1869
01:26:06,118 --> 01:26:10,000
the plant that's how that works so I

1870
01:26:08,560 --> 01:26:12,000
apprciate

1871
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:15,118
it okay I think I'm done with the

1872
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:15,118
questions sorry

1873
01:26:15,520 --> 01:26:19,159
laor okay

1874
01:26:21,319 --> 01:26:26,439
byebye thank you thank you everybody for

1875
01:26:24,439 --> 01:26:29,198
all the great questions and uh maybe

1876
01:26:26,439 --> 01:26:29,198
we'll do this again

1877
01:26:29,479 --> 01:26:32,879
sometime bye-bye

1878
01:26:35,800 --> 01:26:39,840
now okay I guess I can get

1879
01:26:44,399 --> 01:26:49,238
any um for those of you who remain I

1880
01:26:47,359 --> 01:26:51,118
think Tom Stevenson you wanted to take a

1881
01:26:49,238 --> 01:26:53,399
look at this chart again and there it is

1882
01:26:51,118 --> 01:26:57,079
I'll leave it up so that you can take a

1883
01:26:53,399 --> 01:26:58,679
peek at it right now now and um the rest

1884
01:26:57,079 --> 01:27:00,679
of you you might want to copy down some

1885
01:26:58,679 --> 01:27:02,880
of that information but there you go

1886
