1
00:00:06,049 --> 00:00:11,310
this kind of program would best benefit

2
00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:12,809
those people who wants a garden versus

3
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:14,970
actually going into the community and

4
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:17,250
trying to persuade people to garden

5
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:19,649
because that takes a different approach

6
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:21,509
and it goes beyond food security it goes

7
00:00:19,649 --> 00:00:23,609
beyond food as a facilitator the

8
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:26,240
community's needs always come first and

9
00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:29,609
it's hard to watch that because

10
00:00:26,239 --> 00:00:31,469
we are also in an educational system

11
00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:35,308
where there are sort of experts and

12
00:00:31,469 --> 00:00:36,988
people who are not experts so as experts

13
00:00:35,308 --> 00:00:39,358
we come in thinking oh this is what they

14
00:00:36,988 --> 00:00:40,948
need but that's what it's failed for so

15
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:43,859
many years coming in with that mindset

16
00:00:40,948 --> 00:00:45,299
so coming in with letting the community

17
00:00:43,859 --> 00:00:46,879
decide what they want in the day is the

18
00:00:45,299 --> 00:00:48,928
most important part

19
00:00:46,878 --> 00:00:51,628
partnerships are very very community

20
00:00:48,929 --> 00:00:52,948
specific so for example if you're

21
00:00:51,628 --> 00:00:54,899
working with like a Senior Living Center

22
00:00:52,948 --> 00:00:56,968
it's not a better set of the food that

23
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:59,158
grown it's about the type of spices it

24
00:00:56,969 --> 00:01:01,079
reminds them of home it reminds them of

25
00:00:59,158 --> 00:01:04,709
a time of their lives and it's in a lot

26
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:08,399
of seniors aging can bring about issues

27
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:10,949
of isolation loneliness so anything that

28
00:01:08,399 --> 00:01:12,750
can remind them of home it's something

29
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:14,789
that they want and what we've seen in

30
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:16,920
Downton is become and some of the Senior

31
00:01:14,789 --> 00:01:19,890
Living Centers is that more the gardens

32
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:21,539
are herb based and that's an example of

33
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:23,009
being community specific and

34
00:01:21,539 --> 00:01:24,629
understanding community knowledge

35
00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:27,450
because you're going into a population

36
00:01:24,629 --> 00:01:29,009
that has knowledge of the old days and

37
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:31,019
they want to remember the old days and

38
00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:32,239
under the old days so the partnerships

39
00:01:31,019 --> 00:01:35,728
also about

40
00:01:32,239 --> 00:01:37,408
being community specific it encourages

41
00:01:35,728 --> 00:01:40,438
community involvement and participation

42
00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:42,299
in all levels but then it also empowers

43
00:01:40,438 --> 00:01:44,489
communities to commit to long term

44
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:47,219
change it seems because the bean plant

45
00:01:44,489 --> 00:01:48,509
grows perfectly around the corner

46
00:01:47,218 --> 00:01:50,908
doesn't suffocate the corn at all

47
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:52,909
actually they go together thinking about

48
00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:56,780
see December facilitation

49
00:01:52,909 --> 00:01:59,549
it's a partnership but it's not defined

50
00:01:56,780 --> 00:02:01,289
based on what we think a partnership is

51
00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:03,569
to be a lot of times we think it's a

52
00:02:01,289 --> 00:02:06,239
50/50 thing when working with

53
00:02:03,569 --> 00:02:08,039
communities is never 5050 it could be

54
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:10,349
eight its winning it could be twenty

55
00:02:08,038 --> 00:02:12,329
forty I mean it it might mean it might

56
00:02:10,349 --> 00:02:14,039
not even be a hundred percent and we

57
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:16,320
have to rid ourselves on the idea what

58
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:18,030
we think a partnership is and rethink

59
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:20,459
the idea of a partnership and that's

60
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:23,120
what cedar Supper is all about when it

61
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:23,120
comes to community development

62
00:02:28,909 --> 00:02:30,969
