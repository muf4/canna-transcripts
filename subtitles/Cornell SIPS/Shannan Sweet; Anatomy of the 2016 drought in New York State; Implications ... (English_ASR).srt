1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,509
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:08,910
University so as they've mentioned today

3
00:00:06,509 --> 00:00:11,429
I'll be talking a little bit about the

4
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:13,830
2016 drought in New York State and how

5
00:00:11,429 --> 00:00:15,870
that impacted agriculture and maybe some

6
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:18,960
of the implications for water resources

7
00:00:15,869 --> 00:00:20,549
and I just want to point out obviously

8
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,990
Dave is one of my mentors and then

9
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:25,260
Rebecca banner who is the chief

10
00:00:21,989 --> 00:00:29,339
scientist role of New York State really

11
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:32,309
great team okay and just in case anyone

12
00:00:29,339 --> 00:00:34,679
forgot we had a drought in 2016 um I

13
00:00:32,308 --> 00:00:36,780
know 2017 was pretty wet so sometimes we

14
00:00:34,679 --> 00:00:39,090
lose sight of what happened just the

15
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:41,120
previous year but these are just a few

16
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:45,570
of the headlines from mid-july through

17
00:00:41,119 --> 00:00:47,878
August in 2016 pointing out that this is

18
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:52,259
the worst drought in you know almost 100

19
00:00:47,878 --> 00:00:54,929
years and it was a big deal but we

20
00:00:52,259 --> 00:00:57,299
wanted to see how severe was the drought

21
00:00:54,929 --> 00:00:59,189
really from a historical perspective so

22
00:00:57,299 --> 00:01:00,119
we're all scientists and we like to look

23
00:00:59,189 --> 00:01:02,849
at these things a little more

24
00:01:00,119 --> 00:01:07,379
empirically so the first thing we did

25
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:10,409
was analyze 60 years of air temperature

26
00:01:07,379 --> 00:01:12,899
precipitation and snowfall data and

27
00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:15,930
streamflow data throughout New York to

28
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:18,960
see just how bad was 2016 relative to

29
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:20,880
the past 60 years and then we want to

30
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:23,099
know well how was agriculture impacted

31
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:25,798
by this drought so we surveyed farmers

32
00:01:23,099 --> 00:01:28,379
across all of their state to get an idea

33
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:31,200
of their yield loss that Konami impact

34
00:01:28,379 --> 00:01:33,179
how they either were or not able to cope

35
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:37,020
with the drought and and how they

36
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:38,460
reacted in real-time and then finally

37
00:01:37,019 --> 00:01:41,188
and importantly what does this mean for

38
00:01:38,459 --> 00:01:42,989
water resources why do we care how

39
00:01:41,188 --> 00:01:45,569
farmers reacted and how they were

40
00:01:42,989 --> 00:01:47,658
impacted by the drought so to get at

41
00:01:45,569 --> 00:01:50,639
this we actually modeled crop irrigation

42
00:01:47,659 --> 00:01:54,060
water use throughout New York State and

43
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:58,200
we did this because water use reporting

44
00:01:54,060 --> 00:02:00,840
by the agricultural sector is it's not

45
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:03,780
well recorded or known attract because

46
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:06,478
unless the farmer is using over 100,000

47
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:08,128
gallons of water in a day or three

48
00:02:06,478 --> 00:02:09,508
million gallons in a month they don't

49
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:13,439
actually have to report their water

50
00:02:09,508 --> 00:02:15,689
usage and we have over 35,000

51
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:17,909
farms covering 20% of New York's land

52
00:02:15,689 --> 00:02:19,229
and a majority of those farms aren't

53
00:02:17,909 --> 00:02:21,389
using that much water but you can

54
00:02:19,229 --> 00:02:25,109
imagine that adds up even if a farmer is

55
00:02:21,389 --> 00:02:28,379
only using 50,000 gallons so we modelled

56
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:30,600
it in sort of an average here a 15-year

57
00:02:28,379 --> 00:02:32,849
mean to get a sense of sort of normal

58
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:34,650
typical water use and then in a drought

59
00:02:32,849 --> 00:02:39,539
year so what what did it look like in

60
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:42,060
2016 so our study site is New York and I

61
00:02:39,539 --> 00:02:44,009
love this math because it shows all the

62
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:46,229
agriculture in New York so this is

63
00:02:44,009 --> 00:02:48,719
fruits and vegetables and field crops

64
00:02:46,229 --> 00:02:51,569
and everything and you can see pretty

65
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:54,810
obvious the Adirondacks State Park where

66
00:02:51,569 --> 00:02:57,180
there's no agriculture and Manhattan and

67
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:59,370
then importantly and why we all love the

68
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:02,219
Finger Lakes and Cornell it's really

69
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:06,390
dense in the Finger Lakes region they're

70
00:03:02,219 --> 00:03:09,960
Western and then the dots indicate all

71
00:03:06,389 --> 00:03:12,479
of the counties where we had 275 farmers

72
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:14,280
respond to our drought survey so pretty

73
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:17,310
good response rate and that was in

74
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:20,879
August in September of 2016 and you can

75
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:23,039
also see that just about every County

76
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:25,799
with significant agriculture we had

77
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:28,139
farms respond so that was pretty cool

78
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:31,200
and then we also conducted more in depth

79
00:03:28,139 --> 00:03:34,199
in person interviews with 75 of those

80
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:37,769
farmers in January and February so kind

81
00:03:34,199 --> 00:03:40,319
of post growing season all right before

82
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:42,540
I get into my historical analysis of the

83
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:45,120
drought I want to point out the Drought

84
00:03:42,539 --> 00:03:46,319
Monitor Maps for 2016 and if none of you

85
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,989
are familiar with the Drought Monitor

86
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:52,609
there's the the website it's really cool

87
00:03:48,989 --> 00:03:55,590
it takes into account more than just

88
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:57,330
climatological measures so obviously

89
00:03:55,590 --> 00:04:00,360
temperature and rainfall and so on are

90
00:03:57,330 --> 00:04:02,550
important but they also get subjective

91
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:03,989
opinions so they actually ask farmers on

92
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:05,310
the ground how are you being impacted by

93
00:04:03,989 --> 00:04:07,830
the drought and that goes into these

94
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:09,479
maps so essentially I just want to point

95
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:11,430
out that in 2016

96
00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:13,979
throughout the growing season the

97
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:15,209
Drought Monitor map did suggest that the

98
00:04:13,979 --> 00:04:17,099
drought got progressively worse

99
00:04:15,209 --> 00:04:20,730
throughout New York State and

100
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:23,939
particularly here in western New York

101
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:25,710
and I'm pointing that out because not

102
00:04:23,939 --> 00:04:27,089
only do we have a lot of dense

103
00:04:25,709 --> 00:04:29,549
agriculture in western

104
00:04:27,089 --> 00:04:31,379
or where the drought was the worst but

105
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:33,360
also I'm gonna present some data

106
00:04:31,379 --> 00:04:36,180
specifically just from that western New

107
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:39,780
York region today for the sake of time a

108
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:42,418
and B so that I don't dilute the results

109
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:44,129
because a lot of the agriculture in

110
00:04:42,418 --> 00:04:46,909
eastern New York wasn't impacted

111
00:04:44,129 --> 00:04:49,709
similarly the drought wasn't as bad so

112
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:55,199
I'll point out when I'm focusing just on

113
00:04:49,709 --> 00:04:58,879
western New York it's quite striking

114
00:04:55,199 --> 00:05:02,819
that the area of extreme drought is

115
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:05,240
almost adjacent to an area of no drought

116
00:05:02,819 --> 00:05:08,279
yeah I know it is quite striking and

117
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:10,350
I'll I'll give you the the link and

118
00:05:08,279 --> 00:05:12,539
connection to my publication at the very

119
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:15,689
end of this and I do go through and

120
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:18,379
analyze very discrete regions in New

121
00:05:15,689 --> 00:05:21,509
York State and it is surprising how

122
00:05:18,379 --> 00:05:24,060
different the impact the historical

123
00:05:21,509 --> 00:05:26,728
analysis of the meteorological data and

124
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:30,418
also the agricultural impact is in just

125
00:05:26,728 --> 00:05:33,389
one region that is directly adjacent to

126
00:05:30,418 --> 00:05:35,159
another so yeah and again in the drought

127
00:05:33,389 --> 00:05:37,829
maps they're taking into account more

128
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:39,180
than just rainfall and temperature you

129
00:05:37,829 --> 00:05:42,240
know they're thinking about soil types

130
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:47,490
and other things like that but yeah it

131
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:49,288
is quite striking okay so for our data

132
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:54,210
again this is gonna be just for that

133
00:05:49,288 --> 00:05:56,939
western New York region and this is that

134
00:05:54,209 --> 00:05:59,579
historical snowfall rainfall and air

135
00:05:56,939 --> 00:06:01,228
temperature data and that's what I would

136
00:05:59,579 --> 00:06:04,259
call maybe the snow season so it's the

137
00:06:01,228 --> 00:06:06,870
November December of 2015 and then

138
00:06:04,259 --> 00:06:09,959
January February March of 2016 so

139
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:13,439
basically the the winter and spring time

140
00:06:09,959 --> 00:06:14,728
meeting in - 2016 and then we have

141
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:16,228
rainfall throughout the growing season

142
00:06:14,728 --> 00:06:18,719
and air temperature throughout the

143
00:06:16,228 --> 00:06:20,699
growing season all of the black lines

144
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:25,139
are that 60 year average

145
00:06:20,699 --> 00:06:27,120
so 1955 to 2015 all the gray lines for

146
00:06:25,139 --> 00:06:30,150
snow and rainfall or the lower 10th

147
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:32,879
percentile so in that 60 year period how

148
00:06:30,149 --> 00:06:34,529
load it again and then for air

149
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:36,658
temperature it's the upper 90th

150
00:06:34,529 --> 00:06:38,968
percentile so in that 60 year age how

151
00:06:36,658 --> 00:06:40,889
hot did it get and then the red lines

152
00:06:38,968 --> 00:06:43,439
are 2016 so

153
00:06:40,889 --> 00:06:45,569
it's pretty striking here that you can

154
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:48,090
see snowfall was not only below average

155
00:06:45,569 --> 00:06:50,699
for the entire snow season but it

156
00:06:48,089 --> 00:06:52,818
reached historical lows in November

157
00:06:50,699 --> 00:06:55,919
December and March

158
00:06:52,819 --> 00:06:58,050
similarly rainfall was below average for

159
00:06:55,918 --> 00:07:01,139
most of the growing season reaching

160
00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:03,538
historical lows in June we did get that

161
00:07:01,139 --> 00:07:05,189
little peak of rain and August but that

162
00:07:03,538 --> 00:07:06,839
was too little too late the farmers had

163
00:07:05,189 --> 00:07:09,120
already been pretty severely affected

164
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:11,638
and it didn't compensate for the lack of

165
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:13,949
snow and rain in the spring summer and

166
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:16,110
air temperatures were above average for

167
00:07:13,949 --> 00:07:21,080
the entire season reaching historical

168
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:21,080
record highs in August and September

169
00:07:21,348 --> 00:07:25,468
so all those combined

170
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:28,620
again in western New York specifically

171
00:07:25,468 --> 00:07:30,180
led to record low stream some of the

172
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:33,180
lowest stream flows we've ever seen in

173
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:36,449
the past 60 years dipping below that

174
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:38,579
historical low in the middle of the

175
00:07:36,449 --> 00:07:41,069
growing season and so that's indicative

176
00:07:38,579 --> 00:07:42,810
of not only depleted surface water

177
00:07:41,069 --> 00:07:45,150
resources but also groundwater resources

178
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:47,939
both of which farmers rely on either

179
00:07:45,149 --> 00:07:49,918
sleeper irrigation and we had plenty of

180
00:07:47,939 --> 00:07:51,930
farmers tell us not only did their ponds

181
00:07:49,918 --> 00:07:55,680
and streams dry up but their wells went

182
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:57,598
completely bone dry ok so that kind of

183
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:00,269
answers the first question how severe

184
00:07:57,598 --> 00:08:02,250
was this drought well according to this

185
00:08:00,269 --> 00:08:04,709
fairly long-term record it was pretty

186
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:07,949
historically severe especially in

187
00:08:04,709 --> 00:08:11,459
western New York so next question how

188
00:08:07,949 --> 00:08:13,740
was agriculture impacted again this is

189
00:08:11,459 --> 00:08:15,598
just for western New York because the

190
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:18,088
impact on farms in eastern New York was

191
00:08:15,598 --> 00:08:21,240
a little bit less severe so this figure

192
00:08:18,088 --> 00:08:23,939
is showing on the x-axis the percent

193
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:26,370
crop looks so did a farmer lose 0 to 10

194
00:08:23,939 --> 00:08:28,740
percent of their crop 11 to 30 percent

195
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:31,019
and so on and then on the y-axis the

196
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:35,370
percent of respondents the estimated

197
00:08:31,019 --> 00:08:37,458
losses within those ranges and so the

198
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:39,658
thing that jumps out to me first is that

199
00:08:37,458 --> 00:08:42,059
irrigated crops which are the the

200
00:08:39,658 --> 00:08:44,750
striped bars fared a little bit better

201
00:08:42,059 --> 00:08:47,639
you can see over half of the farmers

202
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:49,230
lost less than 10 percent of their crops

203
00:08:47,639 --> 00:08:51,568
and that's actually maybe a typical

204
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:53,579
annual loss anyway but then if you look

205
00:08:51,568 --> 00:08:54,589
at the solid black and followed purple

206
00:08:53,578 --> 00:08:58,370
bars which are

207
00:08:54,590 --> 00:09:01,730
rain-fed crops you can see that about

208
00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:05,360
half of the farmers lost over 50% of

209
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:07,370
their crops in western New York and this

210
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,769
is a wide variety of fruits and

211
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:14,169
vegetables and field crops and different

212
00:09:09,769 --> 00:09:17,029
sized farms and you can also see that

213
00:09:14,169 --> 00:09:20,269
over ten percent maybe about 15 percent

214
00:09:17,029 --> 00:09:24,289
of rain-fed fruit and vegetable crops so

215
00:09:20,269 --> 00:09:27,199
yield losses of over 90% so pretty

216
00:09:24,289 --> 00:09:28,429
extreme and then when we ask them to

217
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,620
reap economic impact

218
00:09:28,429 --> 00:09:33,019
over 80% of the farmers in western New

219
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:35,360
York said that it was either moderate or

220
00:09:33,019 --> 00:09:37,970
severe and only 1% of all of those

221
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:41,870
farmers said man I was merely a nuisance

222
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:43,670
there was really no economic impact okay

223
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:46,490
so now we're shifting to the whole of

224
00:09:43,669 --> 00:09:49,000
New York State this is all 275 farmers

225
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:51,350
when we asked them what was it that

226
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:54,470
limited your ability to maintain your

227
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:56,210
yields not surprisingly about 70 percent

228
00:09:54,470 --> 00:10:00,740
said either irrigation equipment or

229
00:09:56,210 --> 00:10:02,570
water supplies and so when we asked them

230
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:04,850
well and this is what we asked them in

231
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:06,470
August and September what might you have

232
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:08,779
done differently if you had known in

233
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:10,940
advance just how bad this drought was

234
00:10:08,779 --> 00:10:13,220
going to be and you can see a relatively

235
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:15,770
similar distribution for answers

236
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:17,509
relating to changing their crop types or

237
00:10:15,769 --> 00:10:21,919
diversifying or maybe changing the

238
00:10:17,509 --> 00:10:23,480
planting dates but 22% said we would

239
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:26,269
have bought more irrigation equipment

240
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:27,950
and then 36% said we would have done

241
00:10:26,269 --> 00:10:30,069
something else that you didn't actually

242
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:32,720
list here and that included things like

243
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:34,550
increasing your water storage so more

244
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:37,670
ponds or wells and other irrigation

245
00:10:34,549 --> 00:10:39,829
infrastructure really kind of cool

246
00:10:37,669 --> 00:10:41,149
another big chunk of farmers said that

247
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:42,710
they would have done things to improve

248
00:10:41,149 --> 00:10:45,740
their soil health

249
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:48,230
so more cover crops less tillage so on

250
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:52,090
and then another chunk of farmers said

251
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:54,740
that they would have done something to

252
00:10:52,090 --> 00:10:56,840
increase their economic resiliency so

253
00:10:54,740 --> 00:11:00,110
maybe start doing some of these things

254
00:10:56,840 --> 00:11:02,960
earlier or recover fallow fields or just

255
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:05,409
increase their ability to feed their

256
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:07,579
cows

257
00:11:05,409 --> 00:11:09,499
okay so now this is the follow-up

258
00:11:07,578 --> 00:11:11,299
interviews so now we have a sense of

259
00:11:09,499 --> 00:11:12,558
what farmers were thinking in August in

260
00:11:11,299 --> 00:11:13,578
September when they were kind of in the

261
00:11:12,558 --> 00:11:15,169
thick of the drought they didn't

262
00:11:13,578 --> 00:11:19,458
actually know exactly how much they had

263
00:11:15,169 --> 00:11:21,378
lost yet we asked them well what did you

264
00:11:19,458 --> 00:11:24,859
actually do and this is in January and

265
00:11:21,379 --> 00:11:28,100
February during the drought real-time to

266
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:29,180
cope with this situation seven percent

267
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:32,149
said they changed their irrigation

268
00:11:29,179 --> 00:11:34,039
management strategy and so often they

269
00:11:32,149 --> 00:11:36,230
told me that many irrigating it really

270
00:11:34,039 --> 00:11:37,429
inopportune time maybe like at two

271
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:40,039
o'clock in the afternoon and in the

272
00:11:37,429 --> 00:11:42,078
middle of August just so that they can

273
00:11:40,039 --> 00:11:43,639
get through all of their fields seven

274
00:11:42,078 --> 00:11:45,498
percent so they created makeshift

275
00:11:43,639 --> 00:11:47,899
watering systems they were using

276
00:11:45,499 --> 00:11:49,819
fertilizer chemical sprayers to irrigate

277
00:11:47,899 --> 00:11:51,470
they were driving their pickup truck to

278
00:11:49,818 --> 00:11:53,389
their neighbors and just filling up jugs

279
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:56,839
of water and using hoses and watering

280
00:11:53,389 --> 00:12:00,318
cans basically just desperate times call

281
00:11:56,839 --> 00:12:02,029
for desperate measures 16 percent went

282
00:12:00,318 --> 00:12:03,979
out and bought irrigation equipment and

283
00:12:02,028 --> 00:12:06,078
another 16 percent invested in water

284
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:10,129
supplies so they dug ponds or they

285
00:12:06,078 --> 00:12:12,378
drilled wells again with the follow-ups

286
00:12:10,129 --> 00:12:14,778
we asked farmers okay so after what you

287
00:12:12,379 --> 00:12:16,639
experienced in 2016 has this changed

288
00:12:14,778 --> 00:12:20,448
your perspective on future drought over

289
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:22,339
half of the farmer said yes and then

290
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:23,688
finally we asked them all right we know

291
00:12:22,339 --> 00:12:25,160
what you were thinking about in August

292
00:12:23,688 --> 00:12:27,318
and September in terms of what you would

293
00:12:25,159 --> 00:12:30,049
have done differently you told us what

294
00:12:27,318 --> 00:12:31,938
you actually did differently in 2016 so

295
00:12:30,049 --> 00:12:33,919
now what are you thinking about doing in

296
00:12:31,938 --> 00:12:36,230
the future to cope with future drought

297
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:39,078
so maybe in 2017 or in the next few

298
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:41,480
years six percent said they're gonna

299
00:12:39,078 --> 00:12:44,058
invest in irrigation equipment twenty

300
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:47,269
six percent water sources so again ponds

301
00:12:44,058 --> 00:12:48,799
well streams and so on and then 11

302
00:12:47,269 --> 00:12:51,470
percent are gonna change their

303
00:12:48,799 --> 00:12:53,389
irrigation management routine and this

304
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:55,428
is a very water focused presentation but

305
00:12:53,389 --> 00:12:58,399
I do want to point this out because Dave

306
00:12:55,428 --> 00:13:00,438
is so proud of this 32 percent of the

307
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:02,899
farmers said to help them cope with

308
00:13:00,438 --> 00:13:05,808
future drought they plan to improve

309
00:13:02,899 --> 00:13:08,419
their soil organic matter so again cover

310
00:13:05,808 --> 00:13:11,539
cropping reducing tillage adding organic

311
00:13:08,419 --> 00:13:14,678
matter to their soil so that was pretty

312
00:13:11,539 --> 00:13:17,178
awesome they know that healthier soil

313
00:13:14,678 --> 00:13:18,519
increases your resiliency to these

314
00:13:17,178 --> 00:13:20,750
climate extreme

315
00:13:18,519 --> 00:13:23,720
all right so we basically answered

316
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:25,370
number two farmers were pretty severely

317
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:27,440
affected especially in western New York

318
00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:29,839
and this got them thinking about drought

319
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:33,709
in the future they are thinking maybe

320
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:35,180
it's gonna occur more frequently and how

321
00:13:33,708 --> 00:13:38,059
they're gonna prepare and then we

322
00:13:35,179 --> 00:13:39,979
actually saw them change their behavior

323
00:13:38,059 --> 00:13:41,629
and do things that they may not have

324
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:45,709
normally done if they weren't in the pic

325
00:13:41,629 --> 00:13:47,028
of a really bad drought so finally well

326
00:13:45,708 --> 00:13:49,639
what does this all mean for water

327
00:13:47,028 --> 00:13:53,659
resources in a fairly water rich usually

328
00:13:49,639 --> 00:13:55,970
relatively humid state like New York so

329
00:13:53,659 --> 00:13:58,730
before I get into our actual crop

330
00:13:55,970 --> 00:14:01,370
irrigation potential crop irrigation

331
00:13:58,730 --> 00:14:04,089
marios I want to point out this great

332
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:07,220
figure from one of Dave's publications

333
00:14:04,089 --> 00:14:09,620
showing that in a lot of this is just

334
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:12,589
Rochester New York over about a hundred

335
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:14,889
year period but this could be said for a

336
00:14:12,589 --> 00:14:17,750
lot of regions in New York State where

337
00:14:14,889 --> 00:14:20,569
we see precipitation the blue line

338
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:23,208
doesn't quite compensate for potential

339
00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:25,278
evapotranspiration the red line during

340
00:14:23,208 --> 00:14:27,559
several summer months so we have the

341
00:14:25,278 --> 00:14:30,350
summer water deficit and essentially

342
00:14:27,559 --> 00:14:32,328
what that means is there's a period in

343
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:35,180
the summer even historically speaking

344
00:14:32,328 --> 00:14:38,208
where irrigation could actually increase

345
00:14:35,179 --> 00:14:39,708
agricultural production so you think

346
00:14:38,208 --> 00:14:41,828
about the farmers that went out and

347
00:14:39,708 --> 00:14:44,389
bought irrigation equipment and 2016

348
00:14:41,828 --> 00:14:46,129
they're probably going to use it even in

349
00:14:44,389 --> 00:14:48,919
a normal year because they've already

350
00:14:46,129 --> 00:14:50,600
made that investment but now we think

351
00:14:48,919 --> 00:14:54,649
about this is where my climate change

352
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:56,959
minds thoughts come in the summers in

353
00:14:54,649 --> 00:14:59,659
New York are predicted to get longer

354
00:14:56,958 --> 00:15:01,549
quote unquote just because the freeze

355
00:14:59,659 --> 00:15:04,370
freeze in length is gonna get longer and

356
00:15:01,549 --> 00:15:07,578
also hotter and drier so this is data

357
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:10,039
from the North American regional climate

358
00:15:07,578 --> 00:15:12,708
change assessment program and it's

359
00:15:10,039 --> 00:15:15,948
comparing a historical 30-year mean to

360
00:15:12,708 --> 00:15:18,289
this projected future 30-year mean and

361
00:15:15,948 --> 00:15:20,750
this is just for the summer they have

362
00:15:18,289 --> 00:15:24,219
all the different seasons and the entire

363
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:26,059
United States so you can if you want but

364
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:27,680
essentially what they're saying is in

365
00:15:26,059 --> 00:15:29,838
the summer temperatures throughout New

366
00:15:27,679 --> 00:15:32,029
York see in the future could increase

367
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:34,370
anywhere from 3 to almost 60

368
00:15:32,029 --> 00:15:36,829
Fahrenheit depending on where you are in

369
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:41,360
the state precipitation could decrease

370
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:44,210
3/8 about 6% and the freeze free season

371
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:47,769
length could increase anywhere from 20

372
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:50,900
to 30 days in various parts of New York

373
00:15:47,769 --> 00:15:52,669
so what does this mean well we already

374
00:15:50,899 --> 00:15:54,439
have historically speaking a summer

375
00:15:52,669 --> 00:15:56,899
water deficit here a period in the

376
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:59,690
summer where irrigation could be optimal

377
00:15:56,899 --> 00:16:02,120
but with climate change we're gonna see

378
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:04,310
that grave off blob get really big and

379
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:08,960
tall basically you're gonna have sort of

380
00:16:04,309 --> 00:16:11,359
longer warmer drier seasons which

381
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:15,620
increases crop water demand longer

382
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:17,360
seasons and hotter summers which and you

383
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:19,009
combine that with decreased

384
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:23,360
precipitation in the summer you're gonna

385
00:16:19,009 --> 00:16:27,679
see a bump in irrigation okay so now for

386
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:29,629
our what are you smuggling this is a at

387
00:16:27,679 --> 00:16:31,909
the county level in the manuscript it's

388
00:16:29,629 --> 00:16:34,460
actually going to be like the Dec

389
00:16:31,909 --> 00:16:37,219
drought zone level so this one's a

390
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:40,340
little bit finer scale but basically

391
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:42,680
this image is showing sort of normal

392
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:46,129
average year potential crop irrigation

393
00:16:42,679 --> 00:16:48,469
water use and again I'll give you a link

394
00:16:46,129 --> 00:16:50,659
to the manuscript at the end of this I'm

395
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:52,700
not going to get into all of the

396
00:16:50,659 --> 00:16:53,689
modeling techniques used because that

397
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:56,629
would be kind of boring

398
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:58,700
but essentially what you're seeing is on

399
00:16:56,629 --> 00:17:01,129
average most counties throughout New

400
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:03,259
York State use maybe ten to a hundred

401
00:17:01,129 --> 00:17:05,509
thousand cubic meters of water

402
00:17:03,259 --> 00:17:07,190
throughout an entire growing season so

403
00:17:05,509 --> 00:17:10,160
that's actually not that much water use

404
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:12,890
with a few counties may be using 100

405
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:14,930
around eight hundred thousand cubic

406
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:17,000
meters and then of course we have a Long

407
00:17:14,930 --> 00:17:19,670
Island with sandy soils and they have a

408
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:23,420
lot of sod and heavily irrigated

409
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:27,410
agricultural acres but then if we look

410
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:29,210
like at a year like 2016 it gets really

411
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:31,610
colorful all of a sudden because now

412
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:33,529
counties are using on average across the

413
00:17:31,609 --> 00:17:36,289
state eight times the amount of water

414
00:17:33,529 --> 00:17:40,490
and a dry year compared to an average

415
00:17:36,289 --> 00:17:41,779
year some counties 17 to 23 times so for

416
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:43,730
some regions we were seeing eight

417
00:17:41,779 --> 00:17:45,910
hundred percent increase in water ease

418
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:49,930
in a single growing season

419
00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:52,029
and that equates to about four billion

420
00:17:49,930 --> 00:17:54,900
additional gallons water being used just

421
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:54,899
wandering

422
00:17:55,200 --> 00:18:00,700
so in conclusion with this giant climate

423
00:18:00,190 --> 00:18:02,410
change

424
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:05,590
blob there's various things that could

425
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:08,050
happen in New York including one day of

426
00:18:05,589 --> 00:18:09,639
mentioned the increased kind of flooding

427
00:18:08,049 --> 00:18:12,909
with these heavy rainfall events but

428
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:16,170
also maybe more short-term summer

429
00:18:12,910 --> 00:18:18,279
droughts like the one we saw in 2016 so

430
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:20,650
essentially we're gonna have a lot more

431
00:18:18,279 --> 00:18:23,349
variability and uncertainty in our water

432
00:18:20,650 --> 00:18:26,470
supply so how much is coming when where

433
00:18:23,349 --> 00:18:28,629
and so on and one of the ways farmers

434
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:30,279
will adapt to this is to increase their

435
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:32,410
irrigation infrastructure that's not

436
00:18:30,279 --> 00:18:34,750
terribly surprising and we're also not

437
00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:37,000
just assuming that we saw that happen in

438
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:40,480
2016 we talked to farmers they told us

439
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:42,579
is a what they wanted to do be what they

440
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:45,309
did and we'll see what they're going to

441
00:18:42,579 --> 00:18:47,039
do more of in the future and that's

442
00:18:45,309 --> 00:18:50,169
gonna increase agricultural water use

443
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:53,049
because again even in a normal average

444
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:55,810
typical year there is a summer water

445
00:18:53,049 --> 00:18:57,519
deficit so it would be ideal for a

446
00:18:55,809 --> 00:19:01,659
farmer to irrigate if they've already

447
00:18:57,519 --> 00:19:04,089
invested in the infrastructure and so

448
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:06,009
and maybe a dry drought here that could

449
00:19:04,089 --> 00:19:08,379
just maintain their agricultural

450
00:19:06,009 --> 00:19:10,779
productivity but if you have kind of a

451
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:12,880
normal New York summer that could

452
00:19:10,779 --> 00:19:16,149
actually increase your productivity and

453
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:17,920
then that could also entice farmers from

454
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:19,630
other regions in the country to come to

455
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:22,210
New York and farm if they see this

456
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:24,790
so for instance in the western or

457
00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:28,360
Midwestern regions where they have much

458
00:19:24,789 --> 00:19:31,000
more long-term severe droughts and much

459
00:19:28,359 --> 00:19:33,099
more limited water resources they might

460
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:35,140
be enticed to come to New York and start

461
00:19:33,099 --> 00:19:38,289
farming here and so that's just gonna

462
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:40,270
keep increasing this this water resource

463
00:19:38,289 --> 00:19:43,420
competition and not just in the

464
00:19:40,269 --> 00:19:45,400
agricultural sector but also the other

465
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:48,400
competing forces and the industrial

466
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:50,170
sector or residential sectors and then

467
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:52,269
that feeds right back into the loop of

468
00:19:50,170 --> 00:19:55,450
increased variability and uncertainty in

469
00:19:52,269 --> 00:19:57,639
our water supply so I'll leave you with

470
00:19:55,450 --> 00:19:59,590
this thought and that is given the

471
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:02,259
economic necessity to you

472
00:19:59,589 --> 00:20:05,558
irrigation to maintain eels maybe even

473
00:20:02,259 --> 00:20:07,450
increase productivity even in a normal

474
00:20:05,558 --> 00:20:09,700
kind of average year in New York State a

475
00:20:07,450 --> 00:20:10,929
lot of the resource managers across the

476
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:13,890
state need to start thinking about

477
00:20:10,929 --> 00:20:16,509
climate change climate uncertainty and

478
00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:18,309
potentially increased irrigation water

479
00:20:16,509 --> 00:20:21,400
use which is just going to create more

480
00:20:18,308 --> 00:20:24,069
uncertainty in the water supply and this

481
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:25,778
goes for a historically humid region

482
00:20:24,069 --> 00:20:28,000
like New York or anywhere in the world

483
00:20:25,778 --> 00:20:30,190
but anywhere in the country the whole

484
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:33,159
southeastern United States need to start

485
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:35,130
thinking about this and so the questions

486
00:20:33,159 --> 00:20:37,419
that I'm gonna continue to address are a

487
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:39,909
power farmers going to adapt to climate

488
00:20:37,419 --> 00:20:42,640
change we saw some of that with how they

489
00:20:39,909 --> 00:20:44,830
adapt it in 2016 with the drought and be

490
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:47,559
how do we protect our water resources

491
00:20:44,829 --> 00:20:49,359
and agriculture in New York State and

492
00:20:47,558 --> 00:20:51,639
keep them both viable they're both

493
00:20:49,359 --> 00:20:53,439
really important for the economy of New

494
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:55,360
York State and obviously food and water

495
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:58,990
are two pretty important thanks for all

496
00:20:55,359 --> 00:21:02,439
of us then finally I'll leave you with a

497
00:20:58,990 --> 00:21:04,120
few of our publications so we had a lot

498
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:05,919
of extension publications come out of

499
00:21:04,119 --> 00:21:08,619
just the survey results if you're

500
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:11,038
interested in digging in deeper vej edge

501
00:21:08,619 --> 00:21:13,619
scaffolds and what's cropping off our

502
00:21:11,038 --> 00:21:16,750
vegetable fruit and field crops

503
00:21:13,619 --> 00:21:18,609
extension publications Kix if you don't

504
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:21,429
know about them is the Cornell Institute

505
00:21:18,609 --> 00:21:23,288
for climate smart solutions they're

506
00:21:21,429 --> 00:21:25,990
their briefs are usually geared more

507
00:21:23,288 --> 00:21:29,079
towards policymakers and researchers and

508
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:32,019
then the north eastern organic dairy

509
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:33,939
producers Alliance or Association I

510
00:21:32,019 --> 00:21:36,369
can't remember which and then finally

511
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:38,409
this is our publication that we put out

512
00:21:36,369 --> 00:21:39,939
in December that goes into a much

513
00:21:38,409 --> 00:21:42,190
greater detail of everything that I

514
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:43,808
covered today and you can also look at

515
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:45,820
how the different regions throughout New

516
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:47,769
York were impacted differently and

517
00:21:45,819 --> 00:21:49,509
that's my email address if you want any

518
00:21:47,769 --> 00:21:50,980
of this material or have questions about

519
00:21:49,509 --> 00:21:55,480
the nature that fellowship or anything

520
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:57,460
and then I'll leave this up that's crazy

521
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:59,259
so I know it's a lot of text but I also

522
00:21:57,460 --> 00:22:00,970
know that a lot of you are involved in

523
00:21:59,259 --> 00:22:03,099
extension work and you're probably

524
00:22:00,970 --> 00:22:04,630
interested in not just how farmers were

525
00:22:03,099 --> 00:22:06,369
impacted and maybe like what they're

526
00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:08,409
doing but what do they want what do they

527
00:22:06,369 --> 00:22:10,599
want us to do so the last question we

528
00:22:08,409 --> 00:22:12,870
asked on the survey is what do you want

529
00:22:10,599 --> 00:22:15,329
us to do what can and

530
00:22:12,869 --> 00:22:17,278
and researchers and you know extension

531
00:22:15,329 --> 00:22:19,259
agents do to help you cope with and

532
00:22:17,278 --> 00:22:22,048
prepare for drought in the future the

533
00:22:19,259 --> 00:22:25,440
number one response of what the farmers

534
00:22:22,048 --> 00:22:28,019
want is better long-range forecasts and

535
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:29,909
I told people that and they actually got

536
00:22:28,019 --> 00:22:32,400
on top of it so people like Toby ol and

537
00:22:29,909 --> 00:22:34,830
art say Gaetano who is a co-author on

538
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:37,380
that manuscript are working on those and

539
00:22:34,829 --> 00:22:40,019
then the number one thing they want to

540
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:42,720
know more about is drought resistant

541
00:22:40,019 --> 00:23:14,220
crops and then I'll leave the slide up

542
00:22:42,720 --> 00:23:15,808
that you can take yeah and I actually so

543
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:18,750
I'll repeat that question just in case

544
00:23:15,808 --> 00:23:21,538
you didn't hear us in Geneva the

545
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:23,788
question was about the amount of drip

546
00:23:21,538 --> 00:23:25,879
irrigation that's used in New York State

547
00:23:23,788 --> 00:23:28,859
relative to other types of irrigation

548
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:30,600
and off the top of my head I don't have

549
00:23:28,859 --> 00:23:32,219
that exact number I do have it in the

550
00:23:30,599 --> 00:23:34,980
manuscript I think there's actually a

551
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:38,159
large percentage of irrigation in New

552
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:40,980
York State is drip irrigation and I've

553
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:43,980
talked to irrigation experts at Cornell

554
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:47,190
and some say depending on the crop that

555
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:50,069
doesn't always actually save water so

556
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:52,140
obviously that's going to be better than

557
00:23:50,069 --> 00:23:54,359
flood irrigation but drip irrigation

558
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:56,669
isn't always the best but yeah a very

559
00:23:54,359 --> 00:23:59,038
large percentage of farmers who are

560
00:23:56,669 --> 00:24:06,000
irrigating fruit vegetable crops are

561
00:23:59,038 --> 00:24:09,720
using drip irrigation love apples yeah a

562
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:13,500
lot of like strawberries apples if you

563
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:16,829
are irrigating in high tunnels you're

564
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:19,890
probably using drip irrigation but not

565
00:24:16,829 --> 00:24:22,079
always some use overhead sprayers I

566
00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:24,270
would say some of the really large may

567
00:24:22,079 --> 00:24:26,579
be cabbage farmers and and potato

568
00:24:24,269 --> 00:24:30,299
farmers are using

569
00:24:26,579 --> 00:24:32,579
Center pivots and larger sprayers but a

570
00:24:30,299 --> 00:24:34,710
good portion of drip I think you're

571
00:24:32,579 --> 00:24:36,779
suggesting like if it looks like we

572
00:24:34,710 --> 00:24:46,559
really start putting pressure on water

573
00:24:36,779 --> 00:24:48,029
resources yeah absolutely yeah so these

574
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:49,639
are some of the things that we need to

575
00:24:48,029 --> 00:24:51,869
start helping if farmers are going to

576
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:54,630
invest in irrigation infrastructure that

577
00:24:51,869 --> 00:24:55,919
we need to help them think about and I

578
00:24:54,630 --> 00:24:58,350
think and a lot of farmers said that

579
00:24:55,920 --> 00:25:00,210
they want to know like how do I save

580
00:24:58,349 --> 00:25:02,129
water what kind of irrigation should I

581
00:25:00,210 --> 00:25:03,960
be using for different crops these are

582
00:25:02,130 --> 00:25:06,150
things they did want to know so I guess

583
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:10,500
then that's not us we have to help them

584
00:25:06,150 --> 00:25:12,240
where the researchers yeah consume that

585
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:15,539
your irrigation water is coming from

586
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:21,000
wells not always a lot of them are using

587
00:25:15,539 --> 00:25:22,559
ponds on farm ponds or streams a good

588
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:25,049
number of farms have streams running

589
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:27,690
through them some of them are somewhat

590
00:25:25,049 --> 00:25:29,430
seasonal and perennial so you know they

591
00:25:27,690 --> 00:25:32,400
may not always be flowing and especially

592
00:25:29,430 --> 00:25:34,410
in 2016 but yeah a lot of farmers just

593
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:37,590
pump right out of creeks and streams

594
00:25:34,410 --> 00:25:39,900
that sometimes are fed by Springs so

595
00:25:37,589 --> 00:25:41,699
they don't dry off I would say it was

596
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:46,050
pretty I actually have in some of the

597
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:47,970
survey results a figure that shows what

598
00:25:46,049 --> 00:25:50,220
portion of the different types of

599
00:25:47,970 --> 00:25:51,829
irrigation equipment and the types of

600
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:54,299
water sources the farmers are using

601
00:25:51,829 --> 00:25:56,819
surprisingly about 15% said they're

602
00:25:54,299 --> 00:25:59,460
using city water so they're paying

603
00:25:56,819 --> 00:26:02,970
dearly for water to irrigate and I had

604
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:05,460
one farmer who has an apple orchard said

605
00:26:02,970 --> 00:26:08,789
he used about 10 million gallons of city

606
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:11,190
water in 2016 he normally uses 3 million

607
00:26:08,789 --> 00:26:16,319
throughout the growing season so yeah

608
00:26:11,190 --> 00:26:19,980
huge was just asking about for those

609
00:26:16,319 --> 00:26:23,819
farmers who are using wells did you also

610
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:26,430
detect a decline in the quality of water

611
00:26:23,819 --> 00:26:29,399
as a result of the drought and Carozza

612
00:26:26,430 --> 00:26:30,960
increased salinity and cetera yeah I

613
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:34,259
didn't actually ask them about the

614
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:36,480
quality of the water but I would presume

615
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:37,980
yeah whatever water source you're using

616
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:40,380
is you're getting less and less even

617
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:42,750
ponds the quality would decrease well

618
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:45,360
what not with the exception of probably

619
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:46,500
city water but I didn't ask that

620
00:26:45,359 --> 00:26:50,879
question I would be interesting

621
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:52,769
follow-up are you is everyone in Geneva

622
00:26:50,880 --> 00:27:11,040
hearing the questions being asked or

623
00:26:52,769 --> 00:27:12,950
should I repeat them what are you most

624
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:19,529
excited about in terms of adaptation

625
00:27:12,950 --> 00:27:21,420
research yeah so soil health so Dave is

626
00:27:19,529 --> 00:27:23,519
currently working on the New York State

627
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:27,180
soil health initiative along with Cedric

628
00:27:23,519 --> 00:27:29,490
and a handful of others and the beauty

629
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:32,220
of increasing your organic matter on

630
00:27:29,490 --> 00:27:34,289
your farm and your soil is that it makes

631
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:36,150
you resilient against not just droughts

632
00:27:34,289 --> 00:27:39,000
but also these heavy rainfall flooding

633
00:27:36,150 --> 00:27:41,070
events you know and it increases it can

634
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,809
improve productivity and just make your

635
00:27:41,069 --> 00:27:47,279
soils healthier for the plants less

636
00:27:42,809 --> 00:27:49,639
fertilizer it traps greenhouse gases so

637
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:52,170
it's protecting our water and reducing

638
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:54,210
climate change mitigation and also

639
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:57,539
helping the farmer to be more resilient

640
00:27:54,210 --> 00:27:59,549
to potential climate change so yeah I

641
00:27:57,539 --> 00:28:02,879
would say improving soil health is a

642
00:27:59,549 --> 00:28:04,740
pretty easy way to deal with these

643
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:07,080
things for farmers sometimes it's a

644
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:08,670
little bit longer term so you know

645
00:28:07,079 --> 00:28:10,470
obviously buying irrigation equipment is

646
00:28:08,670 --> 00:28:13,200
gonna help you the very next year

647
00:28:10,470 --> 00:28:14,789
soil health takes a little bit but yeah

648
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:17,420
for the long term I would say improving

649
00:28:14,789 --> 00:28:20,039
soil health it is a great adaptation

650
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:22,200
meanwhile thinking about irrigation

651
00:28:20,039 --> 00:28:27,990
infrastructure to protect yourself

652
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:30,390
against drought I think you mentioned

653
00:28:27,990 --> 00:28:32,960
early on about some farmers that are

654
00:28:30,390 --> 00:28:36,620
using 3 million or 10 million gallons

655
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:39,870
what are the reporting requirements for

656
00:28:36,619 --> 00:28:42,959
water that farmers might pump on their

657
00:28:39,869 --> 00:28:46,739
own land and is there a fee or a tax

658
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:49,799
that's paid to the counties or is that

659
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:51,359
bare water to pump you know in terms of

660
00:28:49,799 --> 00:28:53,148
water rights I I don't know anything

661
00:28:51,359 --> 00:28:57,428
about how this work to do

662
00:28:53,148 --> 00:29:00,258
I'm not I went to a really cool water

663
00:28:57,429 --> 00:29:03,979
conference in West Virginia awhile ago

664
00:29:00,259 --> 00:29:07,329
and saw an amazing presentation by a

665
00:29:03,979 --> 00:29:11,808
water rights lawyer out of Pennsylvania

666
00:29:07,329 --> 00:29:14,298
and she said basically to sum it up the

667
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:16,788
eastern seaboard all the northeast

668
00:29:14,298 --> 00:29:19,460
southeast we are the wild wild west when

669
00:29:16,788 --> 00:29:22,669
it comes to water use resources in the

670
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:25,639
West every drop is accounted for in the

671
00:29:22,669 --> 00:29:27,229
East it's really there are no water

672
00:29:25,638 --> 00:29:29,808
rights yet if it's on your own property

673
00:29:27,229 --> 00:29:32,028
you pretty much own it it's not really

674
00:29:29,808 --> 00:29:33,648
regulated if it's your own pond but

675
00:29:32,028 --> 00:29:35,989
those giant ponds could be stopping

676
00:29:33,648 --> 00:29:38,928
water from getting to other water

677
00:29:35,989 --> 00:29:40,999
resources streams it says cheaper county

678
00:29:38,929 --> 00:29:43,729
water for agricultural use you know are

679
00:29:40,999 --> 00:29:45,639
there any County provided water yes so

680
00:29:43,729 --> 00:29:48,348
the people who are using like city water

681
00:29:45,638 --> 00:29:50,928
that is accounted for they have meters

682
00:29:48,348 --> 00:29:52,729
recording every every drop of that water

683
00:29:50,929 --> 00:29:55,849
being used but yeah it's your on-farm

684
00:29:52,729 --> 00:29:57,259
water used and not City water use they

685
00:29:55,848 --> 00:29:58,700
don't technically have to report it

686
00:29:57,259 --> 00:30:00,378
unless they're using over a hundred

687
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:03,679
thousand gallons a day they are supposed

688
00:30:00,378 --> 00:30:06,888
to report it but you know it's it's

689
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:08,059
fairly unregulated and that's I mean

690
00:30:06,888 --> 00:30:10,248
that's just how it's always been and

691
00:30:08,058 --> 00:30:11,808
it's been okay but if we do see more of

692
00:30:10,249 --> 00:30:13,368
these droughts in the future that might

693
00:30:11,808 --> 00:30:16,278
not be okay maybe we need to start

694
00:30:13,368 --> 00:30:23,778
thinking about tapping into other water

695
00:30:16,278 --> 00:30:29,569
resources for farmers and so on can you

696
00:30:23,778 --> 00:30:31,069
repeat that well so yeah that's

697
00:30:29,569 --> 00:30:32,898
something we've thought about and I know

698
00:30:31,069 --> 00:30:35,808
in the southeastern United States so the

699
00:30:32,898 --> 00:30:37,548
question is basically saving the water

700
00:30:35,808 --> 00:30:40,608
catching the water during the rainy

701
00:30:37,548 --> 00:30:42,019
season right and reusing that so for

702
00:30:40,608 --> 00:30:45,019
instance we have these heavy rainfall

703
00:30:42,019 --> 00:30:47,329
events in the springs what and rather

704
00:30:45,019 --> 00:30:50,118
than just let all that runoff and affect

705
00:30:47,329 --> 00:30:52,128
potentially water quality can farmers

706
00:30:50,118 --> 00:30:53,838
keep that and that is definitely one

707
00:30:52,128 --> 00:30:55,699
thing maybe more ditch systems and ponds

708
00:30:53,838 --> 00:30:58,368
on your farm that they're experimenting

709
00:30:55,700 --> 00:31:00,859
with in the southeastern United States

710
00:30:58,368 --> 00:31:02,598
but it would be interesting to to try

711
00:31:00,858 --> 00:31:04,210
that out in New York too and Dave and I

712
00:31:02,598 --> 00:31:06,429
have talked about that a little bit

713
00:31:04,210 --> 00:31:09,730
seems like it could work it's a lot of

714
00:31:06,430 --> 00:31:10,990
investment for a farmer to put in all of

715
00:31:09,730 --> 00:31:13,839
that infrastructure and then you're also

716
00:31:10,990 --> 00:31:18,250
taking land out of production if you're

717
00:31:13,839 --> 00:31:19,929
building you know five acre pond yeah

718
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:21,369
but that would definitely be if we do

719
00:31:19,930 --> 00:31:26,440
start seeing more droughts in the future

720
00:31:21,369 --> 00:31:36,209
one potential way to deal with it did

721
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:39,759
anyone in Geneva have questions yeah

722
00:31:36,210 --> 00:31:42,910
yeah I'm interested in the organic soil

723
00:31:39,759 --> 00:31:46,509
because that's new for me and I know

724
00:31:42,910 --> 00:31:50,830
good organic soil is good in Syria

725
00:31:46,509 --> 00:31:54,009
climate like don't weather so but what's

726
00:31:50,829 --> 00:32:00,629
the percentage of war or chemical so you

727
00:31:54,009 --> 00:32:03,700
know American Western New York State

728
00:32:00,630 --> 00:32:07,540
whoa I might have to feel that question

729
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:10,380
to Dave wolf so the question was what is

730
00:32:07,539 --> 00:32:13,869
the percentage of organic matter in soil

731
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:16,420
sort of the entire country but also New

732
00:32:13,869 --> 00:32:16,959
York may be relative to the entire

733
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:20,769
country

734
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:22,779
well types of sandy soils have very low

735
00:32:20,769 --> 00:32:25,509
potential there's only so much you can

736
00:32:22,779 --> 00:32:27,819
deliver barren sandy soils so they might

737
00:32:25,509 --> 00:32:30,309
be one or two percent organic matter but

738
00:32:27,819 --> 00:32:33,399
a lot of our typical soils home schools

739
00:32:30,309 --> 00:32:36,220
might be three to five percent and

740
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:38,380
farmers can build that up some higher

741
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:39,940
than that you know the better the higher

742
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:41,860
it is the better it is for water holding

743
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:44,980
capacity and then we actually have a few

744
00:32:41,859 --> 00:32:47,229
pockets truly what called bucks where

745
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:50,500
else here in which are really just peat

746
00:32:47,230 --> 00:32:53,380
soil it's almost like super higher we're

747
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:55,660
keep crops and some of the size so kind

748
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:59,050
of range but I think a big target but

749
00:32:55,660 --> 00:33:02,259
most of you kind of loam soil where I

750
00:32:59,049 --> 00:33:04,389
mean anywhere from maybe a pretty good

751
00:33:02,259 --> 00:33:05,769
so might be as low as 2% and four or

752
00:33:04,390 --> 00:33:07,410
five percent and trying to build that up

753
00:33:05,769 --> 00:33:10,720
and see behind

754
00:33:07,410 --> 00:33:13,279
did that answer your question yes thank

755
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:16,490
you yeah

756
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:20,839
I know another question here from Geneva

757
00:33:16,490 --> 00:33:23,779
okay go ahead when you showed the data

758
00:33:20,839 --> 00:33:27,109
that there is a there's a deficit and

759
00:33:23,779 --> 00:33:30,559
precipitation during the summer from the

760
00:33:27,109 --> 00:33:32,000
from the evapotranspiration I know that

761
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:33,710
when you were doing the water balance

762
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:36,950
for that sort of thing you can calculate

763
00:33:33,710 --> 00:33:40,700
how much is coming from the from

764
00:33:36,950 --> 00:33:42,650
underground water that's like because of

765
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:45,259
course planes are not dying every time

766
00:33:42,650 --> 00:33:49,640
during the summer did you take a look at

767
00:33:45,259 --> 00:33:51,710
how doing that specific season because

768
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:55,430
the drought was so severe how much water

769
00:33:51,710 --> 00:33:56,870
was taken out of the water table and if

770
00:33:55,430 --> 00:33:58,880
the following season that was

771
00:33:56,869 --> 00:34:03,799
replenished or the best sort of

772
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:07,580
calculation yeah I didn't actually I

773
00:34:03,799 --> 00:34:10,340
didn't do any real field work aside from

774
00:34:07,579 --> 00:34:12,590
being in the field talking to farmers so

775
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:15,139
I wasn't measuring actual soil moisture

776
00:34:12,590 --> 00:34:16,639
that would have been cool but I'm pretty

777
00:34:15,139 --> 00:34:20,329
sure there is that kind of data

778
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:23,300
available online probably through NOAA

779
00:34:20,329 --> 00:34:25,759
or USGS where you can look at soil

780
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:27,139
moisture and I haven't done that yet it

781
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:29,080
would be interesting I was just

782
00:34:27,139 --> 00:34:32,179
operating under the assumption that

783
00:34:29,079 --> 00:34:35,148
given all the snow and rain that we had

784
00:34:32,179 --> 00:34:37,550
in 2017 that probably the water table

785
00:34:35,148 --> 00:34:40,719
came back up this was a pretty short

786
00:34:37,550 --> 00:34:43,730
term drought not a long term drought

787
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:47,628
yeah that's a good point there is gonna

788
00:34:43,730 --> 00:34:51,679
be water in the soil even during that

789
00:34:47,628 --> 00:34:54,529
summer water deficit period that plants

790
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:56,570
will have available and a lot of there's

791
00:34:54,530 --> 00:34:59,180
a lot of Springs and aquifers that also

792
00:34:56,570 --> 00:35:02,809
help farmers even if you don't have

793
00:34:59,179 --> 00:35:05,659
precipitation helping to compensate for

794
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:08,059
the evapotranspiration but yes I did not

795
00:35:05,659 --> 00:35:15,259
collect the soil moisture data so I

796
00:35:08,059 --> 00:35:18,829
don't know I think yeah in 2016 yeah I

797
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:20,780
would say so and actually we did in 2017

798
00:35:18,829 --> 00:35:23,480
I was so lucky to have two such

799
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:25,730
different years we did survey farmers

800
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:26,990
and ask them about how the heavy

801
00:35:25,730 --> 00:35:30,110
rainfall events and

802
00:35:26,989 --> 00:35:33,559
impacted their farms and their yields

803
00:35:30,110 --> 00:35:35,210
and so on so we do have some of that

804
00:35:33,559 --> 00:35:38,059
data unfortunately we didn't have quite

805
00:35:35,210 --> 00:35:39,380
as great as a response rate um so you

806
00:35:38,059 --> 00:35:41,539
know it's probably not peer-reviewed

807
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:44,210
journal publishable but perhaps in some

808
00:35:41,539 --> 00:35:48,079
of the extension publication so keep

809
00:35:44,210 --> 00:35:49,400
your eyes out for that sorry I couldn't

810
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:50,719
answer that question better but yeah I

811
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:53,960
would say the soil was really dry in

812
00:35:50,719 --> 00:36:08,230
2016 and it probably was it as dry in

813
00:35:53,960 --> 00:36:14,240
2017 a long time going season on 2017

814
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:16,400
I'd come back up yeah yeah yeah if we

815
00:36:14,239 --> 00:36:20,829
had had another low snowpack year it

816
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:20,829
probably would have been pretty damaging

817
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:36,160
reporting issues with the invasive

818
00:36:32,090 --> 00:36:36,160
earthworms and drought related to

819
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:44,690
increased you know basically drought

820
00:36:42,170 --> 00:36:46,039
because of loss of water retention due

821
00:36:44,690 --> 00:36:48,710
to disturbed soil

822
00:36:46,039 --> 00:36:51,920
oh so yeah I don't even this is new to

823
00:36:48,710 --> 00:37:02,539
me so these invasive worms are more

824
00:36:51,920 --> 00:37:05,780
prevalent during drought is that in

825
00:37:02,539 --> 00:37:07,608
cultivated areas and woodlands also and

826
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:09,410
that way that basically the swellest

827
00:37:07,608 --> 00:37:14,840
becomes worm castings and it's really

828
00:37:09,409 --> 00:37:16,159
hard to keep farmers at all I haven't

829
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:18,890
heard anything about it I just wondered

830
00:37:16,159 --> 00:37:23,210
if it came up during the drought it was

831
00:37:18,889 --> 00:37:28,639
harder to yeah no I didn't have farmers

832
00:37:23,210 --> 00:37:31,579
totally anything about the worms but you

833
00:37:28,639 --> 00:37:33,650
know home gardens where you get to the

834
00:37:31,579 --> 00:37:35,750
point where there can be so much more of

835
00:37:33,650 --> 00:37:38,019
activity and so many worms I've hardly

836
00:37:35,750 --> 00:37:39,949
ever seen a commercial farm where

837
00:37:38,019 --> 00:37:45,679
there's death

838
00:37:39,949 --> 00:37:50,649
be public about lubricants it's called

839
00:37:45,679 --> 00:37:50,649
an invasive it has been covered years

840
00:37:58,239 --> 00:38:04,909
yeah they have to deal with so many

841
00:38:02,809 --> 00:38:08,509
other things that's probably bottom of

842
00:38:04,909 --> 00:38:12,289
their list from woodlands you know it's

843
00:38:08,510 --> 00:38:14,450
a bigger issue because the nutrient

844
00:38:12,289 --> 00:38:16,099
cycling be so vast those kind of harms

845
00:38:14,449 --> 00:38:19,219
that the trees are all installed in

846
00:38:16,099 --> 00:38:20,960
Elega annual there's a lot of fast coast

847
00:38:19,219 --> 00:38:25,009
plants eat a lot of nutrients so the

848
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:27,380
worms are doing so much activity the

849
00:38:25,010 --> 00:38:32,300
nutrients give least activity for the

850
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:35,539
trees can actually capture well and also

851
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:37,310
the handsome cuz Emily was saying tend

852
00:38:35,539 --> 00:38:41,230
to be hydrophobic and what they're doing

853
00:38:37,309 --> 00:38:49,039
is greatly reducing the organic matter

854
00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:52,730
the layer of interesting so yeah just

855
00:38:49,039 --> 00:38:55,070
another thing to deal with I guess cool

856
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:56,990
well I guess with that it's almost 110

857
00:38:55,070 --> 00:39:01,809
if we had another really quick question

858
00:38:56,989 --> 00:39:01,809
I could feel that or we can

859
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:07,370
organizations anyone up there that's

860
00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:09,340
educating farmers on some of the

861
00:39:07,369 --> 00:39:11,900
information you come up with like say

862
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:14,320
instead of investing so much into

863
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:17,030
irrigation equipment maybe more soil

864
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:19,789
modification and control it's a cheaper

865
00:39:17,030 --> 00:39:22,190
maybe a bit long term longer term

866
00:39:19,789 --> 00:39:26,440
process is there anybody educating

867
00:39:22,190 --> 00:39:28,849
farmers yeah too much organic man yeah

868
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:34,670
yeah yeah sure right you want to find

869
00:39:28,849 --> 00:39:38,569
that balance is the only way that not

870
00:39:34,670 --> 00:39:41,450
every farmer has six million dollars for

871
00:39:38,570 --> 00:39:43,580
sure yeah so obviously Cornell

872
00:39:41,449 --> 00:39:46,669
Cooperative Extension is incredible

873
00:39:43,579 --> 00:39:48,860
source of Education the soil health

874
00:39:46,670 --> 00:39:51,800
initiative that that Dave and his team

875
00:39:48,860 --> 00:39:53,150
and Cedric are working on is definitely

876
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:53,789
geared towards right now they're doing a

877
00:39:53,150 --> 00:39:56,130
little bit more

878
00:39:53,789 --> 00:39:59,279
search and surveying but the ultimate

879
00:39:56,130 --> 00:40:01,440
plan is to have a website and handouts

880
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:04,019
and information and education for

881
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:06,929
farmers on how to help improve soil

882
00:40:04,019 --> 00:40:08,460
health and so on and then kicks butt

883
00:40:06,929 --> 00:40:19,669
right the Cornell Institute for climate

884
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:19,670
smart yeah I was referring to what you

885
00:40:21,230 --> 00:40:29,070
information yeah so we do have a plan to

886
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:32,190
relay this so all of these publications

887
00:40:29,070 --> 00:40:33,780
veg edge is read by vegetable farmers

888
00:40:32,190 --> 00:40:35,880
across all of New York State it's a it's

889
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:37,620
a publication for vegetable farmers same

890
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:38,280
with the fruit journal and what's

891
00:40:37,619 --> 00:40:41,339
cropping up

892
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:44,400
that's all read by the actual farmers so

893
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:46,170
and it does give it's mostly talking

894
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:48,150
about the survey results but it does

895
00:40:46,170 --> 00:40:49,889
give some ideas of what all the

896
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:51,360
different farmers wanted and you

897
00:40:49,889 --> 00:40:53,159
obviously have those resources that

898
00:40:51,360 --> 00:41:02,880
farmers can follow up with that are

899
00:40:53,159 --> 00:41:04,649
listed in those yeah yep yeah this has

900
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:10,400
been a production of Cornell University

901
00:41:04,650 --> 00:41:10,400
on the web at cornell edu
