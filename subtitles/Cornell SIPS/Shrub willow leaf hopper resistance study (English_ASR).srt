3
00:00:36,759 --> 00:00:43,308
feeding of the leaf hopper damages the

4
00:00:40,308 --> 00:00:48,349
shoot tip and causes this is called a

5
00:00:43,308 --> 00:00:51,319
witch's broom where the lateral shoots

6
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:54,429
are starting to form because the apical

7
00:00:51,320 --> 00:01:02,088
shoot is very damaged

8
00:00:54,429 --> 00:01:06,188
this is beagle and this severely reduces

9
00:01:02,088 --> 00:01:14,239
yield and here's some more damage on

10
00:01:06,188 --> 00:01:17,239
yarn same kind of thing going on because

11
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:19,478
it's chlorosis and necrosis of the

12
00:01:17,239 --> 00:01:19,478
leaves

Tulley a champion and a pretty resistant

19
00:03:01,169 --> 00:03:09,810
variety which is 9 400 6 and this is a

20
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:12,419
choice experiment to see if

21
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:16,740
if given a choice we poppers are feeding

22
00:03:12,419 --> 00:03:19,549
on all three plants or if they're only

23
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:19,550
feeding on

24
00:03:27,289 --> 00:03:32,669
in the choice feeding experiment there

25
00:03:30,628 --> 00:03:34,378
were three different treatments for the

26
00:03:32,669 --> 00:03:37,139
low and high potato leafhopper

27
00:03:34,378 --> 00:03:39,840
treatments I released 20 and 100 adult

28
00:03:37,139 --> 00:03:42,988
potato leaf hoppers respectively into

29
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:45,000
each cage after 24 days I compared the

30
00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:47,158
relative growth rate of each treated

31
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,810
willow genotype to a control that was

32
00:03:47,158 --> 00:03:53,669
not exposed to potato leaf hoppers as

33
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:55,590
you can see in this chart when the

34
00:03:53,669 --> 00:03:57,328
potato leaf hoppers were allowed to feed

35
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:59,639
freely on the three different willow

36
00:03:57,329 --> 00:04:01,290
genotypes within the cages there were

37
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:03,750
significant differences in their

38
00:04:01,289 --> 00:04:06,239
relative growth rates the susceptibility

39
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:08,459
of these willow genotypes to the potato

40
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:10,769
leaf hoppers was consistent with what we

41
00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:13,979
have observed in the field with djor

42
00:04:10,769 --> 00:04:16,410
being most susceptible 9 400 6 most

43
00:04:13,979 --> 00:04:18,629
resistant and telly champion falling

44
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:20,489
somewhere in between this type of

45
00:04:18,629 --> 00:04:22,379
feeding assay proves to be a helpful

46
00:04:20,488 --> 00:04:25,168
tool when trying to compare the

47
00:04:22,379 --> 00:04:27,360
resistance to potato leaf hoppers among

48
00:04:25,168 --> 00:04:31,769
willow cultivars under controlled

49
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:34,500
conditions but still I wondered whether

50
00:04:31,769 --> 00:04:36,779
the 9 400 6 willows continued to grow

51
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:38,879
well in the choice experiment simply

52
00:04:36,779 --> 00:04:41,219
because the leaf hoppers preferentially

53
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:45,389
fed on other genotypes of willow and not

54
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:48,780
on 9 400 6 or whether they did feed on 9

55
00:04:45,389 --> 00:04:53,370
400 6 but is somehow resistant to the

56
00:04:48,779 --> 00:04:55,649
effects of feeding to find the answer to

57
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:58,199
this question I also conducted a no

58
00:04:55,649 --> 00:05:00,359
choice experiment in which 100 adult

59
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:03,030
potato leaf hoppers were trapped inside

60
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:06,330
of cages and forced to feed on chutes of

61
00:05:03,029 --> 00:05:10,228
resistant cultivars for 17 days again I

62
00:05:06,329 --> 00:05:12,149
used Tully champion 9 400 six and a

63
00:05:10,228 --> 00:05:16,978
third potato leaf hopper resistant

64
00:05:12,149 --> 00:05:19,079
cultivar called Preble we've never

65
00:05:16,978 --> 00:05:21,329
observed potato leaf hopper damage on

66
00:05:19,079 --> 00:05:23,459
these cultivars in the field so it was

67
00:05:21,329 --> 00:05:25,379
surprising to find that we saw potato

68
00:05:23,459 --> 00:05:27,448
leaf hopper damaged and significantly

69
00:05:25,379 --> 00:05:29,430
reduced chute growth under the no choice

70
00:05:27,449 --> 00:05:31,590
treatment conditions compared to a

71
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:34,319
control that was not exposed to potato

72
00:05:31,589 --> 00:05:37,019
leaf hoppers based on these results I

73
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:39,389
concluded that for at least these willow

74
00:05:37,019 --> 00:05:40,859
cultivars resistance to potato leaf

75
00:05:39,389 --> 00:05:42,718
hoppers is caused by the

76
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:44,610
leafhoppers preferentially feeding on

77
00:05:42,718 --> 00:05:46,978
certain types of willows and avoiding

78
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:48,870
others we don't know exactly which

79
00:05:46,978 --> 00:05:50,908
willow traits deter the potato leaf

80
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:52,769
hoppers but our breeding program

81
00:05:50,908 --> 00:05:54,930
continues to capitalize on these

82
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:57,120
resistant traits in order to breed

83
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:59,668
cultivars that can thrive under a wide

84
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:01,879
variety of pests and environmental

85
00:05:59,668 --> 00:06:01,878
conditions

86
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:13,950
this has been a production of Cornell
