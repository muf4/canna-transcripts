1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,280
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,979 --> 00:00:04,280
University

3
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:12,900
thanks Megan and I'm really glad to be

4
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:16,259
here a little bit of a step

5
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:18,600
down campus from my previous home and

6
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:21,240
natural resources and across campus from

7
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:22,800
the lab of ornithology and I'm going to

8
00:00:21,239 --> 00:00:25,379
be talking a little bit about work I've

9
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:29,000
done in both places over the past eight

10
00:00:25,379 --> 00:00:32,278
to ten years or so largely focused on

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:36,980
keeping an eye towards effective and

12
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:39,719
intentional design of collaborative

13
00:00:36,979 --> 00:00:42,718
research Endeavors that engage both

14
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:44,460
scientists and members of the public

15
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:46,679
and to start out I really just want to

16
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:48,179
illustrate this with a story and this is

17
00:00:46,679 --> 00:00:50,039
a story of one of the scientists I

18
00:00:48,179 --> 00:00:51,479
interviewed as part of my dissertation

19
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:53,939
research

20
00:00:51,479 --> 00:00:55,619
his name is Jay Nichols he's a

21
00:00:53,939 --> 00:00:57,718
researcher based at the California

22
00:00:55,619 --> 00:01:00,780
Academy of Sciences

23
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:03,179
but he began researching the severely

24
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:05,700
endangered black sea turtle as an

25
00:01:03,179 --> 00:01:08,760
undergraduate and graduate student in

26
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:12,740
the 1980s and at that point the turtle's

27
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:15,719
decline was really severe in part due to

28
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:18,478
overfishing and where Jay was doing his

29
00:01:15,719 --> 00:01:21,900
research in Mexico turtle fishing had

30
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:23,938
actually just been declared illegal

31
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:26,939
so there was really basic research that

32
00:01:23,938 --> 00:01:29,758
was needed on the turtles into where

33
00:01:26,938 --> 00:01:32,219
they were how many were left what

34
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:34,700
threats were facing them what they were

35
00:01:32,219 --> 00:01:37,500
eating where they might be found

36
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:39,240
and he did find success in answering

37
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:41,400
those questions

38
00:01:39,239 --> 00:01:43,798
but in doing so he reflected to me as

39
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:46,560
part of my dissertation work

40
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:48,960
that the idea that you collect data and

41
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:51,180
I'm quoting him here and then use those

42
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:53,759
data to manage a species at risk or an

43
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:55,920
ecosystem at risk makes sense

44
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:58,200
but he went on to say

45
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:01,140
I was realizing that that's certainly

46
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:03,780
not enough and not just not enough but

47
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:07,618
the connection between the science and

48
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:12,020
the conservation action is pretty weak

49
00:02:07,618 --> 00:02:12,020
he said something else needed to happen

50
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:19,020
now for Jay that something else began

51
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:21,780
through partnering with fishermen with

52
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:25,020
those very people in communities who by

53
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:27,598
the fate of a changing law could be

54
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:30,120
referred to as Turtle poachers but they

55
00:02:27,598 --> 00:02:33,238
were Turtle hunters in communities in

56
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:36,480
Baja who had boats who knew how and

57
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:38,700
where to find the turtles and whose

58
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:40,199
cultural heritage and identity were

59
00:02:38,699 --> 00:02:42,719
really linked to those Turtle

60
00:02:40,199 --> 00:02:44,579
populations and some could say to their

61
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:48,359
survival

62
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:50,160
so these Partnerships that Jay began to

63
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:53,580
build with the communities with these

64
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:55,079
individuals grew into a network over a

65
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:58,080
course of a number of years a network

66
00:02:55,080 --> 00:03:01,440
called Grupo torchigero which now

67
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:04,019
conducts regular monthly monitoring of

68
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:07,979
turtle populations

69
00:03:04,019 --> 00:03:09,480
and these um these monitoring

70
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:14,098
initiatives carried out by local

71
00:03:09,479 --> 00:03:16,378
communities now form the basis of

72
00:03:14,098 --> 00:03:20,039
scientific data that collaborating

73
00:03:16,378 --> 00:03:21,500
scientists can access and have used to

74
00:03:20,039 --> 00:03:25,739
publish papers

75
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:27,780
they've used to leverage those data into

76
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:31,200
conservation action

77
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:34,140
and communities have begun hosting sea

78
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:37,158
turtle festivals and education events

79
00:03:34,139 --> 00:03:39,658
and all of this together has

80
00:03:37,158 --> 00:03:43,139
precipitated changes in harvesting and

81
00:03:39,658 --> 00:03:47,000
management practices and the gradual

82
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:47,000
recovery of the sea turtle populations

83
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:52,379
so it's really difficult to draw a

84
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:54,900
causal connection between the work that

85
00:03:52,378 --> 00:03:57,479
Jay has done with these communities and

86
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:59,819
with these individuals and the slow

87
00:03:57,479 --> 00:04:02,818
start of a recovery of these Turtle

88
00:03:59,818 --> 00:04:04,798
populations but nonetheless

89
00:04:02,818 --> 00:04:06,500
something has happened here

90
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:10,580
that has

91
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:10,580
caused a change

92
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:16,798
and the work that I've been involved in

93
00:04:13,459 --> 00:04:20,298
over the past eight to ten years at the

94
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:23,519
lab of ornithology has been looking at

95
00:04:20,298 --> 00:04:26,299
what potentials there are for change

96
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:28,978
through Partnerships with the public

97
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:31,740
towards conservation among other

98
00:04:28,978 --> 00:04:36,860
potential outcomes and what those

99
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:36,860
elements and drivers of change might be

100
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:43,939
some of the things that have been

101
00:04:40,139 --> 00:04:46,199
complicating looking into this is that

102
00:04:43,939 --> 00:04:49,139
these initiatives that involve the

103
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:51,360
public in scientific research have

104
00:04:49,139 --> 00:04:53,460
happened in many different ways in many

105
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:56,400
different places and growing out of

106
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:58,859
traditions that haven't had much of a

107
00:04:56,399 --> 00:05:01,560
conversation with one another about how

108
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:03,960
this work might be done and done well

109
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:05,879
and done intentionally to achieve

110
00:05:03,959 --> 00:05:09,539
desired results

111
00:05:05,879 --> 00:05:12,000
and so to look at what's successful

112
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:15,300
about these Partnerships sort of

113
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,519
requires defining a space and defining a

114
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:19,800
landscape of what it is that we want to

115
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:21,839
investigate and then what's shared about

116
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:24,180
those things and where we also might

117
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:26,159
identify critical differences that can

118
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:27,900
help us understand how these

119
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,880
Partnerships work

120
00:05:27,899 --> 00:05:31,859
and so

121
00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:34,740
I want to talk for a second about

122
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:36,840
terminology just very briefly because in

123
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:39,660
the opening and in the title of this

124
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:42,359
talk it was proposed that the term to

125
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:45,419
describe these Partnerships is public

126
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:47,939
participation in scientific research and

127
00:05:45,418 --> 00:05:49,740
that was a term that we I was part of a

128
00:05:47,939 --> 00:05:52,860
group that coined a number of years back

129
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:54,418
to acknowledge that although the lab of

130
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:56,400
ornithology does something called

131
00:05:54,418 --> 00:05:58,620
citizen science

132
00:05:56,399 --> 00:06:00,000
there was also research happening in

133
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:01,579
context where it's called volunteer

134
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,819
monitoring

135
00:06:01,579 --> 00:06:07,680
Pro-Am Partnerships

136
00:06:04,819 --> 00:06:09,478
community-based forestry that all shared

137
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:12,538
similar um

138
00:06:09,478 --> 00:06:14,099
similar characteristics however

139
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:15,899
even though we coined that term public

140
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:17,699
participation in scientific research

141
00:06:15,899 --> 00:06:20,519
you're going to hear me today default to

142
00:06:17,699 --> 00:06:22,400
using the term citizen science and this

143
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:26,038
is largely because

144
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:28,679
the community has come around to

145
00:06:26,038 --> 00:06:31,740
sharing an appreciation for this term

146
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:34,019
there are clearly some critiques that we

147
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:37,860
could make of this term and how it's

148
00:06:34,019 --> 00:06:39,418
used but um the term has now found its

149
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:41,699
way even into the Oxford English

150
00:06:39,418 --> 00:06:44,099
Dictionary and so while I think it can

151
00:06:41,699 --> 00:06:47,038
be pedantic to share a dictionary

152
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:48,840
definition of a term in an academic talk

153
00:06:47,038 --> 00:06:51,659
I'm putting it up here not so much

154
00:06:48,839 --> 00:06:53,399
because I'm using that definition but

155
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:55,259
because it's actually in the dictionary

156
00:06:53,399 --> 00:06:58,079
which is a huge

157
00:06:55,259 --> 00:07:01,379
step in saying that this is a thing that

158
00:06:58,079 --> 00:07:03,599
exists a phenomenon that's worthy of

159
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:05,759
um of attention and it's actually a

160
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:07,319
decent definition scientific work

161
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:10,620
undertaken by members of the public

162
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:12,419
often not always often in collaboration

163
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:14,639
with or under the direction of

164
00:07:12,418 --> 00:07:17,099
professional scientists and scientific

165
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:19,379
institutions Okay so

166
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:21,419
citizen science

167
00:07:19,379 --> 00:07:22,860
what is it good for let's just start

168
00:07:21,418 --> 00:07:25,159
there

169
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:28,020
when done well

170
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:30,780
citizen science can give scientists

171
00:07:28,019 --> 00:07:34,258
access to data that are otherwise

172
00:07:30,779 --> 00:07:36,478
unfeasible to collect and that can

173
00:07:34,259 --> 00:07:38,220
result in significant new scientific

174
00:07:36,478 --> 00:07:41,038
insights such as

175
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:43,139
the landscape scale insights into bird

176
00:07:41,038 --> 00:07:45,839
population trends that are modeled here

177
00:07:43,139 --> 00:07:48,478
through data collected and shared by

178
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:51,179
amateur bird observers through the lab

179
00:07:48,478 --> 00:07:52,978
of ornithology's eBird project

180
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:55,280
so citizen science is about data

181
00:07:52,978 --> 00:07:55,279
collection

182
00:07:56,399 --> 00:08:01,799
but citizen science by its very nature

183
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:04,978
is also about experiences and it results

184
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:07,199
in experiences for The Observers that

185
00:08:04,978 --> 00:08:09,180
are taking part in that project and this

186
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:11,478
is a photo of Sherman's Creek a

187
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:14,280
watershed in south central Pennsylvania

188
00:08:11,478 --> 00:08:16,620
where residents in the 1990s began

189
00:08:14,279 --> 00:08:20,279
collecting Baseline water quality data

190
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:21,780
in the Watershed in response to planned

191
00:08:20,279 --> 00:08:23,038
development that threatened this

192
00:08:21,779 --> 00:08:24,719
resource

193
00:08:23,038 --> 00:08:26,759
so this was a community that already

194
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,199
knew this Watershed intimately it ran

195
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:29,879
through their backyards it ran through

196
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:32,219
their communities but through

197
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:35,099
Partnerships with Scientists at

198
00:08:32,219 --> 00:08:36,778
Dickinson College they and through the

199
00:08:35,099 --> 00:08:38,940
process of data collection they came to

200
00:08:36,778 --> 00:08:41,820
know that resource also scientifically

201
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:45,600
and they use those experiences and those

202
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:49,459
data to successfully ban the proposed

203
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,459
power plant in their neighborhood

204
00:08:51,539 --> 00:08:59,039
science has a lot of essential to affect

205
00:08:55,580 --> 00:09:01,259
quite a few different outcomes

206
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:03,659
and taken together the opportunity to

207
00:09:01,259 --> 00:09:06,240
impact both science and learning

208
00:09:03,659 --> 00:09:10,079
seems to offer powerful possibilities

209
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:13,440
for conservation action

210
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:16,379
and in fact back in 2009 when at the lab

211
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:18,300
of ornithology we did a quick survey of

212
00:09:16,379 --> 00:09:19,860
practitioners of Citizen science people

213
00:09:18,299 --> 00:09:22,079
who are running and managing citizen

214
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:25,740
science projects and ask them what their

215
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:28,860
goals were we found that they were

216
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:31,139
really pretty evenly split between goals

217
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:34,080
for science goals for education and

218
00:09:31,139 --> 00:09:36,539
Outreach and goals for let's just say

219
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:39,600
conservation stewardship or or changing

220
00:09:36,539 --> 00:09:42,019
Behavior somehow making an impact on the

221
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,019
environment

222
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:46,620
but we know that achieving any one of

223
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:49,620
these goals any one of these results

224
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:52,379
through citizen science or through

225
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:56,399
science itself requires really careful

226
00:09:52,379 --> 00:09:59,240
and intentional work and planning for

227
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:59,240
any given project

228
00:10:00,059 --> 00:10:05,338
and if we reflect for just a moment on

229
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,980
the turtle research example that I

230
00:10:05,339 --> 00:10:11,459
mentioned from Jay Nichols

231
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:14,278
I'd like to suggest that

232
00:10:11,458 --> 00:10:15,838
that J success may be due in a large

233
00:10:14,278 --> 00:10:18,120
part

234
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:21,480
because he recognizes that conservation

235
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:24,179
and conservation action doesn't just

236
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:26,100
look and feel like this

237
00:10:24,179 --> 00:10:28,859
like going out

238
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:31,680
and uh observing the turtles but

239
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:35,278
conservation action

240
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:36,899
is really a socially embedded

241
00:10:35,278 --> 00:10:39,480
process

242
00:10:36,899 --> 00:10:42,839
and whether we want to save the world or

243
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:45,778
a single species no matter how rigorous

244
00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:48,180
or compelling the research itself no

245
00:10:45,778 --> 00:10:50,600
matter how impactful the learning for

246
00:10:48,179 --> 00:10:53,639
the individuals who take part

247
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:55,980
that science and that learning is

248
00:10:53,639 --> 00:10:58,799
embedded and surrounded by a social

249
00:10:55,980 --> 00:11:01,920
context of people and values and budgets

250
00:10:58,799 --> 00:11:04,259
and priorities that also influences

251
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:06,419
decisions when it comes to conservation

252
00:11:04,259 --> 00:11:08,458
and change

253
00:11:06,419 --> 00:11:12,000
so citizen science

254
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:14,458
may be and we suggest can be a powerful

255
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,860
tool in these settings because it can

256
00:11:14,458 --> 00:11:20,278
engage both the scientific and the

257
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:21,240
social aspects of conservation questions

258
00:11:20,278 --> 00:11:23,159
um

259
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:25,620
but how can we

260
00:11:23,159 --> 00:11:28,139
how can we make sure

261
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:30,000
that we think carefully about how to do

262
00:11:28,139 --> 00:11:34,578
both of those things well both the

263
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,578
social engagement and the science

264
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:40,920
so this is coming back to uh research

265
00:11:39,179 --> 00:11:43,139
that I started with colleagues with the

266
00:11:40,919 --> 00:11:47,338
lab of ornithology and a number of other

267
00:11:43,139 --> 00:11:50,220
different institutions back in 2009 2010

268
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:52,320
recognizing that many practitioners had

269
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:54,180
goals that fell into three categories

270
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,700
these are articulated slightly

271
00:11:54,179 --> 00:11:58,439
differently here

272
00:11:55,700 --> 00:12:02,339
but three categories related to outcomes

273
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:05,160
for science outcomes for individuals we

274
00:12:02,339 --> 00:12:07,140
can say learning here and outcomes for

275
00:12:05,159 --> 00:12:10,799
social ecological systems conservation

276
00:12:07,139 --> 00:12:10,799
stewardship behaviors

277
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:17,519
we started looking at the way

278
00:12:13,919 --> 00:12:19,259
participation might be handled and this

279
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:21,240
research started in the context of

280
00:12:19,259 --> 00:12:24,059
informal Science Education so there was

281
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:26,579
an eye particularly towards the outcomes

282
00:12:24,059 --> 00:12:28,679
for individuals here but recognizing

283
00:12:26,578 --> 00:12:30,299
that all of these other things also fell

284
00:12:28,679 --> 00:12:32,099
into the mix

285
00:12:30,299 --> 00:12:33,359
and through research that was funded by

286
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:36,659
the center for the advancement of

287
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:39,079
informal Science Education

288
00:12:36,659 --> 00:12:41,759
um we looked at a number of case studies

289
00:12:39,078 --> 00:12:43,979
of National Science Foundation funded

290
00:12:41,759 --> 00:12:47,879
citizen science projects to try and

291
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:49,740
relate participation and understand how

292
00:12:47,879 --> 00:12:51,000
that public participation in scientific

293
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:53,000
research

294
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,919
might influence

295
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,778
all of these things and through that

296
00:12:55,919 --> 00:13:01,019
work and some work that I'll talk about

297
00:12:57,778 --> 00:13:02,600
in a in a moment

298
00:13:01,019 --> 00:13:05,639
we came to understand

299
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:07,320
that that participation

300
00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:08,940
around that participation it was

301
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:11,820
important to understand

302
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:13,800
two aspects both the degree of public

303
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:16,379
participation in the process of research

304
00:13:13,799 --> 00:13:17,759
and also the quality of that

305
00:13:16,379 --> 00:13:21,200
participation

306
00:13:17,759 --> 00:13:21,200
and let me start with degree

307
00:13:21,958 --> 00:13:27,179
so degree is is a fairly simple concept

308
00:13:25,139 --> 00:13:29,039
a question of who participates and in

309
00:13:27,179 --> 00:13:31,859
what or the depth of public involvement

310
00:13:29,039 --> 00:13:36,480
in the research process and so through

311
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:39,600
the case report for NSF

312
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:41,220
we set up a rubric assuming if we if we

313
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,680
will if you want to accept that the

314
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:46,139
research process of doing science

315
00:13:43,679 --> 00:13:48,059
involves all of these steps and people

316
00:13:46,139 --> 00:13:49,440
can argue that you can articulate this

317
00:13:48,059 --> 00:13:52,799
in different ways but for the purposes

318
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:53,519
of these of This research

319
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:55,859
um

320
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:57,240
we we know that science starts with

321
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:59,039
defining a question or an issue

322
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:01,860
gathering information developing

323
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:03,899
explanations collecting data analyzing

324
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:07,019
data interpreting results and asking you

325
00:14:03,899 --> 00:14:08,940
questions and generally scientists

326
00:14:07,019 --> 00:14:12,120
conduct this whole process themselves

327
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:15,120
but at times the public can be invited

328
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:18,659
to engage in different steps

329
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:22,019
most uh of the projects that the lab of

330
00:14:18,659 --> 00:14:24,899
ornithology runs for example involve the

331
00:14:22,019 --> 00:14:26,759
public at this level collecting samples

332
00:14:24,899 --> 00:14:28,799
are of in the case of birds making

333
00:14:26,759 --> 00:14:31,259
observations and sharing those

334
00:14:28,799 --> 00:14:32,819
observations with Scientists but there

335
00:14:31,259 --> 00:14:36,299
are some cases out there where

336
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:37,920
individuals can engage in a project in a

337
00:14:36,299 --> 00:14:40,679
little bit more of a deeper way and in

338
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:43,799
fact even in some cases where they're

339
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:46,259
engaged in the entire research process

340
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:49,859
the Sherman's Creek example that I

341
00:14:46,259 --> 00:14:52,259
mentioned earlier the community was

342
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:54,659
facilitated by researchers at Dickinson

343
00:14:52,259 --> 00:14:57,720
College in

344
00:14:54,659 --> 00:14:59,219
defining their own question and the

345
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:01,019
protocols and all the way through

346
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:05,100
interpreting the data and using those

347
00:15:01,019 --> 00:15:07,220
data to make change in their communities

348
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:10,800
so in the case report

349
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:12,420
we propose the terms for these Styles

350
00:15:10,799 --> 00:15:13,859
these approaches to participation is

351
00:15:12,419 --> 00:15:15,000
contributory collaborative and

352
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:16,800
co-created

353
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,480
I wouldn't concern yourselves with those

354
00:15:16,799 --> 00:15:20,338
terms terribly much except that I'm

355
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:22,139
going to use them in the graph that

356
00:15:20,339 --> 00:15:24,720
follows to illustrate the kinds of

357
00:15:22,139 --> 00:15:27,120
outcomes that we were starting to see

358
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:30,240
associated with each approach now I have

359
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:32,399
to say that data on the outcomes of

360
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:34,500
these Partnerships are really limited

361
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:36,539
there's not a lot of research that's

362
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:38,759
been done particularly into the learning

363
00:15:36,539 --> 00:15:41,698
outcomes let alone the conservation

364
00:15:38,759 --> 00:15:44,578
outcomes of Citizen science projects

365
00:15:41,698 --> 00:15:47,159
particularly any that can draw clear

366
00:15:44,578 --> 00:15:49,500
causal connections but those data that

367
00:15:47,159 --> 00:15:51,778
are available really were starting to

368
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:53,958
suggest to us that those contributory

369
00:15:51,778 --> 00:15:56,458
projects those where

370
00:15:53,958 --> 00:15:58,799
participants were involved at the level

371
00:15:56,458 --> 00:16:01,138
of collecting data through a protocol

372
00:15:58,799 --> 00:16:03,059
designed by scientists where scientists

373
00:16:01,139 --> 00:16:05,159
were using and analyzing those data to

374
00:16:03,059 --> 00:16:07,859
answer a scientific question we're

375
00:16:05,159 --> 00:16:12,299
really particularly well suited as one

376
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:14,940
might expect to be providing data for

377
00:16:12,299 --> 00:16:17,219
good rigorous peer-reviewed

378
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:19,380
Publications

379
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:22,079
but those that seem to be having the

380
00:16:19,379 --> 00:16:25,799
greatest impact on public learning and

381
00:16:22,078 --> 00:16:28,799
on conservation action fell more in this

382
00:16:25,799 --> 00:16:30,958
category now that's not to say that

383
00:16:28,799 --> 00:16:33,120
these other outcomes didn't happen

384
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:35,819
through these other approaches to

385
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:38,879
participation it's just that it may be

386
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:40,320
more difficult or fewer data were

387
00:16:38,879 --> 00:16:42,778
available

388
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:45,839
and again this was largely coming from

389
00:16:42,778 --> 00:16:48,000
research that was

390
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:50,220
focused on understanding the informal

391
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,919
Science Education outcomes

392
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:55,500
but it came out at a time that several

393
00:16:52,919 --> 00:16:58,379
other Publications were appearing with

394
00:16:55,500 --> 00:17:00,839
very similar typologies of participation

395
00:16:58,379 --> 00:17:05,099
for example Finn Danielson out of the

396
00:17:00,839 --> 00:17:07,740
monitoring matters Network in Copenhagen

397
00:17:05,099 --> 00:17:11,458
articulated very similar categories of

398
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:14,240
participation using different terms and

399
00:17:11,459 --> 00:17:16,620
reviewed over a hundred

400
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:20,160
participatory monitoring research

401
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:23,219
initiatives around the globe and came up

402
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:25,439
with very similar results those where

403
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:29,759
the public were largely involved in

404
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:32,160
collecting data yielded precise and

405
00:17:29,759 --> 00:17:34,980
accurate data however decision making

406
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:37,019
was slower there was lower potential for

407
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:38,400
influencing the capacity of he was

408
00:17:37,019 --> 00:17:40,200
looking at stakeholders in the

409
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:43,740
decision-making process

410
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:46,440
with the flip side on the co-created

411
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:48,419
style of Engagement with higher

412
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:50,820
potential for prompt decision making and

413
00:17:48,419 --> 00:17:52,919
state colder capacities however

414
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:55,439
expectations for data precision and

415
00:17:52,919 --> 00:17:59,059
accuracy might be a little bit lower

416
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:59,058
depending on how that was handled

417
00:17:59,759 --> 00:18:05,640
important ly however Danielson and

418
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:07,500
colleagues pointed out that this was an

419
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:09,980
area where you had to think not just

420
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:12,960
about the degree of public participation

421
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:15,058
but also about the quality of

422
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:17,940
participation

423
00:18:15,058 --> 00:18:21,538
so while the degree of participation is

424
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:24,480
fairly easy to quantify quality is more

425
00:18:21,538 --> 00:18:26,038
subjective and context relevant having

426
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:29,579
to do with things along the lines of

427
00:18:26,038 --> 00:18:32,700
trust and fairness and credibility

428
00:18:29,579 --> 00:18:35,839
and Danielson and others and some of my

429
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:38,519
work published in ecology and Society

430
00:18:35,839 --> 00:18:42,019
draws on participation Theory where

431
00:18:38,519 --> 00:18:45,440
there's a real rich and deep literature

432
00:18:42,019 --> 00:18:49,079
that looks at

433
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:51,179
assumptions which would be easy to make

434
00:18:49,079 --> 00:18:53,399
looking at the implications of the

435
00:18:51,179 --> 00:18:55,440
degree of participation it really

436
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:59,340
challenges assumptions that more

437
00:18:55,440 --> 00:19:02,640
participation is better participation

438
00:18:59,339 --> 00:19:05,879
and really forces the question of asking

439
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:08,340
whose interests are being served and to

440
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:13,740
what end and also how those interests

441
00:19:08,339 --> 00:19:15,839
are balanced in the design of a project

442
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:18,120
and I just want to give you two brief

443
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:21,359
examples where you can think there might

444
00:19:18,119 --> 00:19:22,918
be some disparity between the degree of

445
00:19:21,359 --> 00:19:24,359
participation and the quality of

446
00:19:22,919 --> 00:19:26,940
participation and here I'm going to call

447
00:19:24,359 --> 00:19:29,339
on our eBird project again where the

448
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:32,759
data collection happens at such a large

449
00:19:29,339 --> 00:19:33,918
Geographic scale that it would seem to

450
00:19:32,759 --> 00:19:38,160
minimize

451
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:40,799
project leaders ability to impact the

452
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:42,538
experiences of the volunteers in any

453
00:19:40,798 --> 00:19:44,819
meaningful way

454
00:19:42,538 --> 00:19:48,058
and that can in fact be difficult to do

455
00:19:44,819 --> 00:19:49,678
when the geographic scale is so huge the

456
00:19:48,058 --> 00:19:52,379
project approach that makes the most

457
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:54,240
sense is that contributory approach you

458
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:56,039
ask a lot of people to share a little

459
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:57,359
bit of data and it all adds up and makes

460
00:19:56,038 --> 00:19:59,400
a big difference

461
00:19:57,359 --> 00:20:02,519
but what about the experience and the

462
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:05,580
quality of participation

463
00:20:02,519 --> 00:20:07,798
well just as one example I want to

464
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:10,319
hearken back to the early days of eBird

465
00:20:07,798 --> 00:20:12,900
when participation in the project itself

466
00:20:10,319 --> 00:20:15,538
was really sort of stumbling along in

467
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:17,519
the early 2000s the first few years of

468
00:20:15,538 --> 00:20:21,000
the project

469
00:20:17,519 --> 00:20:24,179
where even though we had leveraged the

470
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:26,640
support of a high-profile marketer to

471
00:20:24,179 --> 00:20:28,980
get the word out about Ebert in all the

472
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:31,559
right journals to tell people to share

473
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:33,660
their brains with science contribute

474
00:20:31,558 --> 00:20:35,579
your data and help make a difference to

475
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:39,419
Scientific researchers at the Cornell

476
00:20:35,579 --> 00:20:40,740
lab of ornithology nothing happens

477
00:20:39,419 --> 00:20:44,100
but

478
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:47,038
in about 2006 with the launch of what at

479
00:20:44,099 --> 00:20:50,579
that time was called eBird 2.0 a

480
00:20:47,038 --> 00:20:53,339
critical shift was made in the way the

481
00:20:50,579 --> 00:20:56,819
project was rolled out and talked about

482
00:20:53,339 --> 00:20:58,678
with a recognition that the birders who

483
00:20:56,819 --> 00:21:01,200
were out there making those high quality

484
00:20:58,679 --> 00:21:03,298
observations

485
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:05,340
sure what the scientists were going to

486
00:21:03,298 --> 00:21:08,279
do with those data but

487
00:21:05,339 --> 00:21:10,500
they love a place where they could

488
00:21:08,279 --> 00:21:13,200
archive their life lists

489
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:15,538
and once we started marketing eBird as a

490
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:17,220
service once we considered the quality

491
00:21:15,538 --> 00:21:19,079
of the participation for those

492
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:21,240
volunteers what they would get out of it

493
00:21:19,079 --> 00:21:23,879
why they would want to take part

494
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:26,339
observations and contributions really

495
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:29,220
skyrocketed

496
00:21:26,339 --> 00:21:32,459
this is another really quick example of

497
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:36,419
a project that unfortunately has folded

498
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:38,640
in the the past number of years in

499
00:21:36,419 --> 00:21:40,919
Canada there was a nationwide set of

500
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:42,720
protocols that really asked people to

501
00:21:40,919 --> 00:21:47,038
make basic observations of something of

502
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:49,980
Interest plants ice out frogs

503
00:21:47,038 --> 00:21:52,980
and then Engage The Local communities in

504
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:55,140
in different areas in asking questions

505
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:56,700
about what they were concerned about in

506
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:57,840
their in their environment in their

507
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:59,640
communities

508
00:21:57,839 --> 00:22:01,918
um and invited them to use some of these

509
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:03,780
protocols to help address those concerns

510
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:06,120
and there's a lot that could be talked

511
00:22:03,779 --> 00:22:08,700
about here but I want to point out that

512
00:22:06,119 --> 00:22:09,899
what I found most compelling one of the

513
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:12,000
things that I found most compelling

514
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:14,220
about this project at the time when they

515
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:17,400
were publishing was that where most

516
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:21,298
projects in the U.S were focused on data

517
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:23,940
quality High Precision accurate data and

518
00:22:21,298 --> 00:22:26,220
could citizen science do this

519
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:28,919
they were asking this project was asking

520
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:31,019
are those data timely are they

521
00:22:28,919 --> 00:22:33,179
accessible to the people who need them

522
00:22:31,019 --> 00:22:35,158
are they relevant in the communities

523
00:22:33,179 --> 00:22:37,860
where they can make a difference and are

524
00:22:35,159 --> 00:22:41,400
they ultimately useful

525
00:22:37,859 --> 00:22:45,119
so how can we start a conversation about

526
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:48,419
these kinds of qualities with the people

527
00:22:45,119 --> 00:22:50,519
who are engaged in um

528
00:22:48,419 --> 00:22:52,799
citizen science and public participation

529
00:22:50,519 --> 00:22:55,319
in scientific research to better

530
00:22:52,798 --> 00:22:58,079
understand the kinds of data and the

531
00:22:55,319 --> 00:23:00,298
kinds of experiences and the kinds of

532
00:22:58,079 --> 00:23:04,158
participation that can make a difference

533
00:23:00,298 --> 00:23:04,158
when it comes to conservation

534
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:10,259
so just briefly I'm going to show you a

535
00:23:07,558 --> 00:23:11,940
common framework that we've articulated

536
00:23:10,259 --> 00:23:13,619
for the design of Citizen science

537
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:16,380
projects and I don't want to belabor

538
00:23:13,619 --> 00:23:18,178
this but I do want to point out that a

539
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:21,179
common logic model can help us think

540
00:23:18,179 --> 00:23:24,780
about how and why we design projects to

541
00:23:21,179 --> 00:23:27,120
get to particular outcomes and that

542
00:23:24,779 --> 00:23:28,918
through citizen science what we're

543
00:23:27,119 --> 00:23:31,439
suggesting right now is that it really

544
00:23:28,919 --> 00:23:33,538
Demands a consideration of both

545
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:37,259
scientific interests and public interest

546
00:23:33,538 --> 00:23:39,960
at the outset in identifying the

547
00:23:37,259 --> 00:23:42,119
question or issue to be addressed and

548
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:44,340
that this kind of conversation will

549
00:23:42,119 --> 00:23:46,139
influence how the research protocols and

550
00:23:44,339 --> 00:23:49,038
trainings are developed and the kinds of

551
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:51,120
experiences that are had by

552
00:23:49,038 --> 00:23:54,919
volunteers as well as the kinds of

553
00:23:51,119 --> 00:23:54,918
observations that they're going to make

554
00:23:55,019 --> 00:24:01,200
and we have already talked about how

555
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:03,960
that can yield a wide range of different

556
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:06,298
kinds of outcomes

557
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:09,120
and through this framework we can start

558
00:24:06,298 --> 00:24:11,879
to better understand how those inputs

559
00:24:09,119 --> 00:24:13,619
can affect the outcomes

560
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:16,140
but here's where I want to focus in a

561
00:24:13,619 --> 00:24:19,158
little bit more on conservation itself

562
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:19,159
as a concept

563
00:24:20,279 --> 00:24:24,658
and this is because

564
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:26,759
um in in the field of conservation

565
00:24:24,659 --> 00:24:29,100
there's more focused attention in the

566
00:24:26,759 --> 00:24:31,079
past number of years on

567
00:24:29,099 --> 00:24:33,240
um conservation evaluation how do we

568
00:24:31,079 --> 00:24:36,000
know that we're achieving the desired

569
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:37,200
goals for conservation and margulis and

570
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,960
colleagues

571
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:43,019
um in that field have really started to

572
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:45,779
push people to I more clearly identify

573
00:24:43,019 --> 00:24:48,379
conservation targets and articulate when

574
00:24:45,779 --> 00:24:51,839
you say you want to affect conservation

575
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:53,820
what is it very specifically that you

576
00:24:51,839 --> 00:24:55,259
want to change and how do you think

577
00:24:53,819 --> 00:24:57,359
you're going to get there through the

578
00:24:55,259 --> 00:24:59,279
work that you're doing

579
00:24:57,359 --> 00:25:01,439
so they're asking people to articulate

580
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:03,779
both conservation targets and Pathways

581
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:05,820
and here's a really you know loose

582
00:25:03,779 --> 00:25:07,259
example we can say that through citizen

583
00:25:05,819 --> 00:25:08,700
science we're going to collect data

584
00:25:07,259 --> 00:25:10,019
that's going to influence science and

585
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:12,000
that somehow that's going to affect

586
00:25:10,019 --> 00:25:14,099
conservation we need we know we need to

587
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,220
do better than that

588
00:25:14,099 --> 00:25:16,219
um

589
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:21,780
and so what are the theories that we

590
00:25:18,779 --> 00:25:24,538
have around how citizen science very

591
00:25:21,779 --> 00:25:26,399
specifically how citizen science might

592
00:25:24,538 --> 00:25:28,500
be making a difference for a particular

593
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:30,120
conservation targets

594
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:31,619
and here's where I want to share a

595
00:25:30,119 --> 00:25:32,879
little snapshot of some of the research

596
00:25:31,619 --> 00:25:35,819
I've done through my dissertation

597
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:38,700
research where I've talked to scientists

598
00:25:35,819 --> 00:25:40,139
about the work that they've done in

599
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:42,840
projects that they've committed their

600
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:43,500
careers to in many cases

601
00:25:42,839 --> 00:25:46,019
um

602
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:49,019
because this is difficult work

603
00:25:46,019 --> 00:25:51,960
engaging the public really is not easy

604
00:25:49,019 --> 00:25:55,200
and it's risky and so what significance

605
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:57,840
and potential might scientists be seeing

606
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:58,980
that would really influence their

607
00:25:57,839 --> 00:26:01,079
commitment

608
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:03,058
to Citizen science to weather their

609
00:26:01,079 --> 00:26:05,099
critiques and pursue this difficult work

610
00:26:03,058 --> 00:26:07,259
I mentioned that I talked to scientists

611
00:26:05,099 --> 00:26:10,139
I did in-depth narrative interviews with

612
00:26:07,259 --> 00:26:12,419
nine individuals who are in many cases

613
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:14,600
high profile scientist Terry Rood is a

614
00:26:12,419 --> 00:26:17,600
Nobel Laureate for her work with the

615
00:26:14,599 --> 00:26:21,058
ipcc on climate change

616
00:26:17,599 --> 00:26:23,939
and I asked them

617
00:26:21,058 --> 00:26:25,079
in in a lot of different ways why it was

618
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:28,140
that they were doing what they were

619
00:26:25,079 --> 00:26:31,319
doing and how it was that their science

620
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:33,480
that they're citizen science worked and

621
00:26:31,319 --> 00:26:35,639
what it was that they were affecting and

622
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:38,640
not to get into the details here but

623
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:40,919
what I heard from them were many

624
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:43,259
different conservation targets a wide

625
00:26:40,919 --> 00:26:46,020
diversity of conservation targets that

626
00:26:43,259 --> 00:26:47,879
fell into categories for science yes

627
00:26:46,019 --> 00:26:49,980
they were doing this because they needed

628
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:52,020
the science they needed the data but

629
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:54,120
because they also saw potentials for

630
00:26:52,019 --> 00:26:56,759
changing the experiences of individuals

631
00:26:54,119 --> 00:26:59,759
and because they saw potentials for

632
00:26:56,759 --> 00:27:02,099
changing conservation

633
00:26:59,759 --> 00:27:06,359
and so drawing on the work of margulis

634
00:27:02,099 --> 00:27:09,298
and all at all to identify conservation

635
00:27:06,359 --> 00:27:11,639
targets and also identify Pathways to

636
00:27:09,298 --> 00:27:13,500
those targets I worked with the

637
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:17,340
narratives of these scientists to start

638
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:19,740
to look at how their experiences were

639
00:27:17,339 --> 00:27:22,439
suggesting that their work could affect

640
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:23,819
their desired conservation outcomes now

641
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:26,640
I do want to point out that I'm not

642
00:27:23,819 --> 00:27:28,740
suggesting that this is actually how it

643
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:30,419
works but how they saw it work there's a

644
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:32,819
lot more research that needs to be done

645
00:27:30,419 --> 00:27:34,799
to see if these pathways are actually

646
00:27:32,819 --> 00:27:36,658
successful but I want to share just two

647
00:27:34,798 --> 00:27:39,359
of them with you and if these two that

648
00:27:36,659 --> 00:27:42,000
I've circled here one is from Jay

649
00:27:39,359 --> 00:27:44,298
Nichols who I mentioned earlier

650
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:47,579
and here I'll just share a quote from

651
00:27:44,298 --> 00:27:49,619
his interview he said

652
00:27:47,579 --> 00:27:52,319
following the excerpt that I that I

653
00:27:49,619 --> 00:27:54,119
shared earlier you can't just create the

654
00:27:52,319 --> 00:27:56,460
knowledge and hand it off and just

655
00:27:54,119 --> 00:27:58,139
expect action from the authorities here

656
00:27:56,460 --> 00:28:00,120
he's talking about management agencies

657
00:27:58,140 --> 00:28:02,038
because they just don't have the

658
00:28:00,119 --> 00:28:04,139
capacity to do that

659
00:28:02,038 --> 00:28:05,819
if we keep expecting them to take the

660
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:09,480
reports and the data and turn it into

661
00:28:05,819 --> 00:28:11,460
action it's kind of a ridiculous dream

662
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:13,319
and it's been a bit of a dream all along

663
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:15,179
I think it's pretty clear to people that

664
00:28:13,319 --> 00:28:17,339
the way it's going to work is for people

665
00:28:15,179 --> 00:28:20,038
to use this knowledge themselves and

666
00:28:17,339 --> 00:28:22,319
create movement or action or change or

667
00:28:20,038 --> 00:28:24,839
whatever it is that they're after so

668
00:28:22,319 --> 00:28:27,000
this is what Jay saw as the potential

669
00:28:24,839 --> 00:28:28,500
for citizen science in part because of a

670
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,599
practical theory that was telling him

671
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:33,380
that the data and the management

672
00:28:30,599 --> 00:28:36,058
agencies weren't going to do it

673
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:39,179
and the pathway that he articulated

674
00:28:36,058 --> 00:28:41,220
related to Citizen science was this the

675
00:28:39,179 --> 00:28:45,740
community members by being involved in

676
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:45,740
data collection were creating knowledge

677
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:52,679
that they themselves had access to

678
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:54,839
and that by defining goals related to

679
00:28:52,679 --> 00:28:57,480
that knowledge for sea turtle protection

680
00:28:54,839 --> 00:28:58,798
they would take knowledge based on that

681
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:01,860
science

682
00:28:58,798 --> 00:29:03,960
to create change now I did mention that

683
00:29:01,859 --> 00:29:05,639
I can't say that this is actually the

684
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:08,880
way it's happening but I can say that

685
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:11,520
it's not unfounded Jay's work has

686
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:13,380
resulted in communities making change in

687
00:29:11,519 --> 00:29:15,480
Marine protected areas where they are

688
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:18,120
residents and so there's reason to

689
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:23,759
really consider that this level of

690
00:29:18,119 --> 00:29:25,439
Engagement can result in actual use of

691
00:29:23,759 --> 00:29:28,859
knowledge use of Science and

692
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:31,880
science-based action for management

693
00:29:28,859 --> 00:29:34,199
so I just want to share another

694
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:36,000
Pathway to illustrate a different kind

695
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:38,819
of conservation change and this is from

696
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:41,640
Bill McShay Bill's a landscape ecologist

697
00:29:38,819 --> 00:29:43,379
based at the Smithsonian conservation

698
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:46,100
Biology Institute in Northern Virginia

699
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:49,080
where he's done work to understand

700
00:29:46,099 --> 00:29:51,719
mammal populations and their influence

701
00:29:49,079 --> 00:29:54,778
on on grasslands throughout Northern

702
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:56,220
Virginia and in other ecosystems around

703
00:29:54,778 --> 00:29:59,220
the world

704
00:29:56,220 --> 00:30:00,659
in Northern Virginia he said though he

705
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:03,240
said to me if you really want to do

706
00:30:00,659 --> 00:30:04,559
conservation on that ecosystem you've

707
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:06,120
got to be working with private

708
00:30:04,558 --> 00:30:08,398
landowners remember this is Northern

709
00:30:06,119 --> 00:30:13,558
Virginia most of the landscape in that

710
00:30:08,398 --> 00:30:16,079
area that's grassland is held um by by

711
00:30:13,558 --> 00:30:18,538
private individuals

712
00:30:16,079 --> 00:30:20,220
he went on to say and their antsy about

713
00:30:18,538 --> 00:30:22,440
government people and official workers

714
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:24,839
they seem to be much more receptive to

715
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:27,240
citizens to the general public to the

716
00:30:24,839 --> 00:30:29,220
birding Club they seem to like that

717
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:31,079
better than the government's going to

718
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:33,839
send a team of people onto your land to

719
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:37,139
see what you've got so it seems to work

720
00:30:33,839 --> 00:30:41,099
best and it in this case was Bill

721
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:45,120
working with volunteers to go on to

722
00:30:41,099 --> 00:30:47,339
these private lands to do Point counts

723
00:30:45,119 --> 00:30:49,859
of bird populations to do butterfly

724
00:30:47,339 --> 00:30:51,480
monitoring surveys and while they were

725
00:30:49,859 --> 00:30:52,199
there

726
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:54,720
um

727
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:56,700
here's the pathway that bill saw as

728
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:58,200
happening between that interaction so

729
00:30:56,700 --> 00:31:00,360
this is the point he wants to get to

730
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:02,460
that the landowners Implement grassland

731
00:31:00,359 --> 00:31:04,678
restoration practices and here's how he

732
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:06,419
saw it happening he needed to conduct

733
00:31:04,679 --> 00:31:08,940
surveys

734
00:31:06,419 --> 00:31:11,399
the private landowners allow access to

735
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:13,440
Citizen volunteers not to the government

736
00:31:11,398 --> 00:31:15,538
people but to the citizen volunteers and

737
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:16,740
while they're there the landowners talk

738
00:31:15,538 --> 00:31:18,599
to them they ask them what they're doing

739
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:21,359
why are they doing it and that

740
00:31:18,599 --> 00:31:23,519
information that informal sharing of

741
00:31:21,359 --> 00:31:26,038
information both the science and the

742
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:29,839
context of conservation has more of an

743
00:31:26,038 --> 00:31:32,819
impact than visits from state employees

744
00:31:29,839 --> 00:31:34,398
resulting in Bill theorizes and in some

745
00:31:32,819 --> 00:31:37,500
cases has seen

746
00:31:34,398 --> 00:31:40,339
changes in their actual management of

747
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:40,339
their lands

748
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:46,200
so

749
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:47,940
these are just a few possibilities that

750
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:50,640
really suggest

751
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:52,140
that attention to the social dimension

752
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,740
of

753
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:54,778
um

754
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:57,240
citizen science a public participation

755
00:31:54,778 --> 00:31:59,460
in scientific research attention to the

756
00:31:57,240 --> 00:32:02,880
public interests to the degree and the

757
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:05,100
quality of participation as well as the

758
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:08,820
scientific needs not instead of but as

759
00:32:05,099 --> 00:32:10,740
well as the scientific needs can be a

760
00:32:08,819 --> 00:32:13,139
step towards conservation and

761
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:16,500
importantly a step that is commensurate

762
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:18,140
with the science and not in opposition

763
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:20,759
to it

764
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:22,679
and I'd like to suggest that these

765
00:32:20,759 --> 00:32:25,460
insights can invite us to think both

766
00:32:22,679 --> 00:32:28,440
more critically and more expansively

767
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:30,720
about Concepts like public engagement a

768
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:33,380
concept that's a key mission of our own

769
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:33,380
Institution

770
00:32:33,898 --> 00:32:37,079
um

771
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:40,519
and public engagement can mean many

772
00:32:37,079 --> 00:32:40,519
things to many different people

773
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:44,419
it can mean

774
00:32:43,019 --> 00:32:48,000
um

775
00:32:44,419 --> 00:32:50,340
research that is shared with the public

776
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:52,619
scientific knowledge that's disseminated

777
00:32:50,339 --> 00:32:55,619
to the public but I'd also like to

778
00:32:52,619 --> 00:32:58,259
suggest that public engagement can

779
00:32:55,619 --> 00:33:00,599
effectively involve inviting

780
00:32:58,259 --> 00:33:02,819
participants to be part of the research

781
00:33:00,599 --> 00:33:03,439
process

782
00:33:02,819 --> 00:33:06,480
um

783
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:08,519
this does have to be done carefully it

784
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:11,220
does have to be done where it's

785
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:12,960
appropriate to do so not all science is

786
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:15,298
appropriate for citizen science or for

787
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:17,159
public engagement but in places where it

788
00:33:15,298 --> 00:33:19,259
is and where there's a potential for

789
00:33:17,159 --> 00:33:23,278
that to have an impact

790
00:33:19,259 --> 00:33:26,038
the evidence is suggesting to us that

791
00:33:23,278 --> 00:33:28,679
more than just the science must be

792
00:33:26,038 --> 00:33:30,778
considered if we are to get to

793
00:33:28,679 --> 00:33:32,580
conservation action through that

794
00:33:30,778 --> 00:33:34,140
research

795
00:33:32,579 --> 00:33:35,939
and I want to wrap up with something

796
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:38,880
that may seem to be at first like a

797
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:43,440
little bit of a non-sequitur

798
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:45,600
and that is that back in 2011 I I helped

799
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:47,940
convene a 60 person

800
00:33:45,599 --> 00:33:49,678
workshop at the American Museum of

801
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:52,200
Natural History

802
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:54,240
which was examining citizen science and

803
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:55,679
conservation called engaging and

804
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:58,140
learning for conservation through public

805
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:59,700
participation in scientific research and

806
00:33:58,140 --> 00:34:01,919
there were a lot of great insights that

807
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:03,840
came out of that event as to what the

808
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:06,659
potential of Citizen science was and how

809
00:34:03,839 --> 00:34:09,000
to work together

810
00:34:06,659 --> 00:34:11,099
but through evaluation we also gained

811
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:13,378
some insights into the practitioner

812
00:34:11,099 --> 00:34:15,599
Community themselves and here's one that

813
00:34:13,378 --> 00:34:17,699
I want to share just because it was so

814
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:20,700
telling in its honesty and this was

815
00:34:17,699 --> 00:34:22,799
shared by presumably a scientist who was

816
00:34:20,699 --> 00:34:25,739
in attendance there a conservation

817
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:27,480
scientist Anonymous said even though it

818
00:34:25,739 --> 00:34:29,819
makes me uncomfortable

819
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:31,559
after this event I'm thinking about ways

820
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:33,300
to communicate and interact on a regular

821
00:34:31,559 --> 00:34:36,179
and frequent basis with the Science

822
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:37,980
Education community

823
00:34:36,179 --> 00:34:40,500
and one of the reasons that I'm sharing

824
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:43,918
this is that if we if we have a hard

825
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:46,099
time interacting with our colleagues

826
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:48,358
across campus

827
00:34:46,099 --> 00:34:49,980
that that can make it even more

828
00:34:48,358 --> 00:34:52,980
difficult and daunting to think about

829
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:56,960
interacting with the public effectively

830
00:34:52,980 --> 00:35:00,119
and so I'd like to suggest that as this

831
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:02,639
conversation about public participation

832
00:35:00,119 --> 00:35:07,019
in scientific research grows

833
00:35:02,639 --> 00:35:10,199
and as the field expands which it is

834
00:35:07,019 --> 00:35:12,300
um that it demands that we step outside

835
00:35:10,199 --> 00:35:14,219
of our comfort zones not just with the

836
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:16,320
public but with our colleagues and

837
00:35:14,219 --> 00:35:19,739
making this a truly interdisciplinary

838
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:21,180
practice because both Jay and Bill and

839
00:35:19,739 --> 00:35:23,639
the other scientists that I interviewed

840
00:35:21,179 --> 00:35:25,199
for my research they're not working in a

841
00:35:23,639 --> 00:35:28,078
vacuum they're not working alone they're

842
00:35:25,199 --> 00:35:30,659
working with colleagues to share

843
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:32,820
insights as to how to effectively engage

844
00:35:30,659 --> 00:35:35,819
the public

845
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:40,019
in new and and potentially different

846
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:42,920
ways to do both science and

847
00:35:40,019 --> 00:35:42,920
conservation

848
00:35:43,199 --> 00:35:47,338
as as an aside just before I close with

849
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:49,440
a few questions I will note if anybody's

850
00:35:47,338 --> 00:35:52,259
interested in this opportunity to engage

851
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:53,639
across disciplines and engage with other

852
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:55,440
colleagues who are involved in public

853
00:35:53,639 --> 00:35:58,739
participation in scientific research

854
00:35:55,440 --> 00:36:01,260
there's a conference being held in San

855
00:35:58,739 --> 00:36:04,979
Jose a pre-conference of the aaas annual

856
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:07,079
meeting on citizen science and our call

857
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:09,539
for proposals has just closed

858
00:36:07,079 --> 00:36:11,760
unfortunately but we did receive over

859
00:36:09,539 --> 00:36:13,980
400 proposals for talks at that

860
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:15,020
conference so it's shaping up to be a

861
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:19,338
really

862
00:36:15,019 --> 00:36:19,338
important event and well attended

863
00:36:19,858 --> 00:36:25,380
so I actually want to close with some

864
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:26,880
questions that were um that were offered

865
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:27,960
by Megan and I'm going to put her on the

866
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:31,019
spot here because when we were

867
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:33,119
corresponding in advance of of my coming

868
00:36:31,019 --> 00:36:34,559
here to give this talk she was

869
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:36,720
suggesting some questions that really

870
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:39,179
resonated with thinking that I have and

871
00:36:36,719 --> 00:36:40,019
asking ourselves as a community

872
00:36:39,179 --> 00:36:42,719
um

873
00:36:40,019 --> 00:36:45,000
how might we do things like develop

874
00:36:42,719 --> 00:36:47,159
opportunities where appropriate

875
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:49,440
for public participation in scientific

876
00:36:47,159 --> 00:36:51,199
research how can we consider both the

877
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:54,480
science and the conservation

878
00:36:51,199 --> 00:36:56,939
possibilities of Citizen science

879
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:59,159
and lastly and this I think is maybe one

880
00:36:56,940 --> 00:37:01,019
of the most important things as this

881
00:36:59,159 --> 00:37:03,719
field grows and people step into this

882
00:37:01,019 --> 00:37:07,259
practice how can both students and

883
00:37:03,719 --> 00:37:09,179
faculty be supported in engaging

884
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:12,180
thoughtfully and effectively in a

885
00:37:09,179 --> 00:37:14,519
practice that can go against some of the

886
00:37:12,179 --> 00:37:18,299
traditions and expectations particularly

887
00:37:14,519 --> 00:37:20,219
in academic departments to do things in

888
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:22,019
new and different ways to achieve the

889
00:37:20,219 --> 00:37:24,118
results that presumably we all want to

890
00:37:22,019 --> 00:37:29,059
achieve for conservation through our

891
00:37:24,119 --> 00:37:29,059
science so I will close there

892
00:37:29,519 --> 00:37:32,239
thanks

893
00:37:36,119 --> 00:37:39,900
yeah absolutely I'm going to repeat the

894
00:37:38,039 --> 00:37:42,239
question just for the benefit of Geneva

895
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:44,460
and the camera why conservation aren't

896
00:37:42,239 --> 00:37:45,959
there other potential outcomes that are

897
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:48,659
just as relevant and just as engaging

898
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:50,159
did I get that right and that's that's a

899
00:37:48,659 --> 00:37:52,199
great question and I really should have

900
00:37:50,159 --> 00:37:55,679
given a little bit more context in the

901
00:37:52,199 --> 00:37:58,259
beginning that this is my personal bias

902
00:37:55,679 --> 00:37:59,578
I was doing my research largely in

903
00:37:58,260 --> 00:38:02,940
relationship to informal Science

904
00:37:59,579 --> 00:38:05,220
Education and conservation but the field

905
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:08,159
of Citizen science is much much broader

906
00:38:05,219 --> 00:38:10,019
in fact there is work now coming into

907
00:38:08,159 --> 00:38:11,279
conversation under the term citizen

908
00:38:10,019 --> 00:38:13,619
science and it's really important to

909
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:16,220
acknowledge that that term citizen

910
00:38:13,619 --> 00:38:18,780
science is now being used to understand

911
00:38:16,219 --> 00:38:21,059
activities that haven't always fallen

912
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:22,560
under that terminology but there's

913
00:38:21,059 --> 00:38:24,659
research now that's being discussed

914
00:38:22,559 --> 00:38:28,619
under that term in public health

915
00:38:24,659 --> 00:38:31,679
for example certainly a long history in

916
00:38:28,619 --> 00:38:34,559
astronomy research in water quality

917
00:38:31,679 --> 00:38:38,098
monitoring so conservation yes is one

918
00:38:34,559 --> 00:38:41,099
you're right very um timely topical

919
00:38:38,099 --> 00:38:44,460
um point of conversation it happens to

920
00:38:41,099 --> 00:38:47,338
be an area and we can talk about why

921
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:51,119
this might be but an area where a large

922
00:38:47,338 --> 00:38:54,779
large number of Citizen science projects

923
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:57,480
have been focused and increasingly

924
00:38:54,780 --> 00:39:00,079
citizen science is now showing up in or

925
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:02,300
moving into areas like

926
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:05,460
microbiology

927
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:07,380
neurobiology even but that's that's

928
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:08,940
fairly recent but yeah conservation is

929
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:10,338
one action-oriented and social

930
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:14,159
scientific

931
00:39:10,338 --> 00:39:16,019
just one example of change

932
00:39:14,159 --> 00:39:18,598
yeah that's a great question

933
00:39:16,019 --> 00:39:20,338
um that Don asks about uh the have there

934
00:39:18,599 --> 00:39:23,280
been any studies to corroborate the

935
00:39:20,338 --> 00:39:25,858
accuracy of of Citizen science data

936
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:30,000
um there's I'll I'll offer two answers

937
00:39:25,858 --> 00:39:31,858
to that one is yes hundreds but the

938
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,179
other answer is the only study that

939
00:39:31,858 --> 00:39:36,980
matters

940
00:39:33,179 --> 00:39:36,980
is the one that you do for your project

941
00:39:37,019 --> 00:39:42,780
because what matters is the design of a

942
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:45,359
given project does it meet the goals

943
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:49,740
that you set out for your project

944
00:39:45,358 --> 00:39:51,659
whatever those might be now a core need

945
00:39:49,739 --> 00:39:53,699
of that is that citizen science is

946
00:39:51,659 --> 00:39:55,639
science there are some things that have

947
00:39:53,699 --> 00:39:58,259
been called citizen science that really

948
00:39:55,639 --> 00:40:01,379
we could make an argument is largely

949
00:39:58,260 --> 00:40:04,400
just education work and the science that

950
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:06,838
results is secondary

951
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:08,639
education is important engagement in

952
00:40:06,838 --> 00:40:13,039
science is important but citizen science

953
00:40:08,639 --> 00:40:16,440
really has that core of useful usable

954
00:40:13,039 --> 00:40:18,300
scientific data now the usefulness of

955
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:20,940
those data may not show up for many

956
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:24,359
years that's possible

957
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:26,639
um but the science is important

958
00:40:24,358 --> 00:40:29,098
any given project is going to have to go

959
00:40:26,639 --> 00:40:31,679
through the difficult work of making

960
00:40:29,099 --> 00:40:33,300
sure that their project is designed in

961
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:34,799
such a way that it can produce those

962
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:36,359
usable data

963
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:38,280
but yeah there are there are hundreds of

964
00:40:36,358 --> 00:40:40,940
papers for individual discrete projects

965
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:40,940
that do show that

966
00:40:42,059 --> 00:40:45,719
yeah that's a great question the

967
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:47,700
question is does the public have a skew

968
00:40:45,719 --> 00:40:48,739
or a bias towards certain organisms or

969
00:40:47,699 --> 00:40:52,858
topics

970
00:40:48,739 --> 00:40:54,959
and you know one of the

971
00:40:52,858 --> 00:40:56,940
the lab of ornithology I'll say in some

972
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:59,338
ways was very lucky

973
00:40:56,940 --> 00:41:00,599
in its history with citizen science

974
00:40:59,338 --> 00:41:03,179
because there were a lot of people

975
00:41:00,599 --> 00:41:05,400
already bird watching a lot of Highly

976
00:41:03,179 --> 00:41:07,739
skilled people already bird watching and

977
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:10,980
our scientists very astutely were able

978
00:41:07,739 --> 00:41:13,259
to capitalize on that there are

979
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:15,240
certainly other taxa for which it has

980
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:17,579
been more difficult to design citizen

981
00:41:15,239 --> 00:41:19,679
science projects and some of the reasons

982
00:41:17,579 --> 00:41:21,900
that we started the words the work that

983
00:41:19,679 --> 00:41:23,699
we've done at the lab of ornithology to

984
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:25,500
look at the practice more broadly of

985
00:41:23,699 --> 00:41:28,679
Citizen science was because we were

986
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:32,179
getting asked questions by people saying

987
00:41:28,679 --> 00:41:34,679
I want to design eBird for

988
00:41:32,179 --> 00:41:36,719
seahorses for example I want to design

989
00:41:34,679 --> 00:41:41,219
citizen science for

990
00:41:36,719 --> 00:41:43,199
jellyfish and we were realizing that you

991
00:41:41,219 --> 00:41:45,239
can't just take an if you build it they

992
00:41:43,199 --> 00:41:47,338
will come approach to Citizen science

993
00:41:45,239 --> 00:41:51,000
because that's certainly not the case

994
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:53,338
however there are now projects that are

995
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:54,900
successfully engaging people in doing

996
00:41:53,338 --> 00:41:56,578
things like

997
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:59,220
um

998
00:41:56,579 --> 00:42:02,400
folding proteins

999
00:41:59,219 --> 00:42:04,199
there's a project called fold it which

1000
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:05,539
I've just started playing with and I

1001
00:42:04,199 --> 00:42:08,159
don't understand

1002
00:42:05,539 --> 00:42:11,400
exactly how people get turned on to it

1003
00:42:08,159 --> 00:42:13,019
yet but it's it's gamifying it's there's

1004
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:15,000
a learning curve so you really have to

1005
00:42:13,019 --> 00:42:17,159
commit to it and yes any project is

1006
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:19,260
going to attract a certain subset of

1007
00:42:17,159 --> 00:42:21,539
people who have a particular affinity

1008
00:42:19,260 --> 00:42:24,720
for doing a certain thing

1009
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:27,420
um but but projects have been successful

1010
00:42:24,719 --> 00:42:30,779
in enticing people to do protein folding

1011
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:32,519
to look at jellyfish to do a wide range

1012
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:34,500
of things and it's the onus is on the

1013
00:42:32,519 --> 00:42:36,480
project developers to really find out

1014
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:39,838
what those public interests are and how

1015
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:42,719
you can make your project resonate with

1016
00:42:39,838 --> 00:42:45,420
the people you're hoping to involve in

1017
00:42:42,719 --> 00:42:47,459
it or vice versa understand where

1018
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:49,079
there's already attention going on to

1019
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:50,820
something that's of interest to you like

1020
00:42:49,079 --> 00:42:53,339
with birds and see how you can

1021
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:54,480
capitalize on that interest I will just

1022
00:42:53,338 --> 00:42:57,420
caution though that I think you

1023
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:59,460
mentioned something about school

1024
00:42:57,420 --> 00:43:01,800
um that some of my early research was on

1025
00:42:59,460 --> 00:43:03,780
student science Partnerships and could

1026
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:06,660
students effectively be motivated to

1027
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:08,760
collect accurate data and there's a sort

1028
00:43:06,659 --> 00:43:12,480
of one step removed question there about

1029
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:14,040
or assumption about motivation which is

1030
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:16,679
that students when they're in a

1031
00:43:14,039 --> 00:43:18,599
classroom are a captive audience yes

1032
00:43:16,679 --> 00:43:19,679
they'll be there to take part in the

1033
00:43:18,599 --> 00:43:22,380
activities

1034
00:43:19,679 --> 00:43:24,299
but the motivation is probably going to

1035
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:26,220
be more along the lines of I'm doing it

1036
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:28,260
because my teacher said so

1037
00:43:26,219 --> 00:43:30,179
and yeah she will find some that you

1038
00:43:28,260 --> 00:43:32,460
will be able to excite about it who

1039
00:43:30,179 --> 00:43:34,199
might not have been excited had they not

1040
00:43:32,460 --> 00:43:37,740
been exposed to it through school but

1041
00:43:34,199 --> 00:43:41,000
school is not necessarily a guarantee of

1042
00:43:37,739 --> 00:43:41,000
some kind of motivation

1043
00:43:41,159 --> 00:43:46,559
yeah that's a great question I I didn't

1044
00:43:44,338 --> 00:43:48,599
put data in there just because I was

1045
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:51,480
trying to make the extreme results as

1046
00:43:48,599 --> 00:43:53,400
visible as possible but I will also say

1047
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:55,740
that that one thing I want to make very

1048
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:58,500
clear is that those were typologies that

1049
00:43:55,739 --> 00:44:01,199
were developed just to help us get a

1050
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:05,639
handle on the landscape of what was

1051
00:44:01,199 --> 00:44:07,039
happening and no one project is a hard

1052
00:44:05,639 --> 00:44:09,960
and fast

1053
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:12,599
contributory project for example or a

1054
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:15,139
co-created project projects can be

1055
00:44:12,599 --> 00:44:19,079
designed to offer

1056
00:44:15,139 --> 00:44:22,139
primarily a contributory experience or

1057
00:44:19,079 --> 00:44:25,140
primarily a co-created experience but

1058
00:44:22,139 --> 00:44:28,078
individuals can engage in a project in a

1059
00:44:25,139 --> 00:44:31,559
wide range of approaches based on how

1060
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:33,119
engaged they they may choose to be so

1061
00:44:31,559 --> 00:44:36,659
for example in the Sherman's Creek

1062
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:38,640
example where the community was engaged

1063
00:44:36,659 --> 00:44:40,679
in water quality monitoring there were

1064
00:44:38,639 --> 00:44:42,299
some people who really just collected

1065
00:44:40,679 --> 00:44:44,759
the data they showed up and they

1066
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:46,740
collected the data and it was a smaller

1067
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:49,079
number of people who did the whole

1068
00:44:46,739 --> 00:44:51,059
process of data analysis protocol

1069
00:44:49,079 --> 00:44:53,700
development and so forth so those aren't

1070
00:44:51,059 --> 00:44:56,219
hard and fast categories the lines are

1071
00:44:53,699 --> 00:44:59,578
slippery and blurry between them and it

1072
00:44:56,219 --> 00:45:01,318
really was a rubric for trying to draw

1073
00:44:59,579 --> 00:45:04,440
some general conclusions that would

1074
00:45:01,318 --> 00:45:05,519
allow us to understand the landscape so

1075
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:08,338
um

1076
00:45:05,519 --> 00:45:10,440
I that's in a way that's a that's a

1077
00:45:08,338 --> 00:45:14,299
Dodge of your question but I hope it

1078
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:14,300
gives you a more helpful answer

1079
00:45:14,338 --> 00:45:19,739
okay well our time is up and I want to

1080
00:45:17,039 --> 00:45:24,199

1081
00:45:19,739 --> 00:45:24,199
presentation thank you Jennifer thanks
