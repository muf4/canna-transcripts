00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,000
This is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:06,400
University.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,719
And we've got a lot uh we want to do

4
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:10,719
this morning with our great guest here,

5
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:12,800
the director of the Northeast Climate

6
00:00:10,718 --> 00:00:15,838
Center and professor here in Earth and

7
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:17,359
Atmospheric Sciences, Dr. RT Gaitano.

8
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:21,199
Thank you all for taking the time to

9
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:23,920
join me and us. Uh Carl, I think it's

10
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:25,760
not too early, is it? It's Mast's week,

11
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:29,199
right, brother? the the beginning of

12
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:31,279
spring for every male species uh in in

13
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:33,840
the in in that plays golf. I would say

14
00:00:31,278 --> 00:00:35,840
this is a global uh phenomenon, right?

15
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,239
Because you hear people in Australia

16
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:40,399
talk about the Augusta effect uh that

17
00:00:38,238 --> 00:00:43,439
they get things. So this is sort of like

18
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:45,600
become a cultural uh piece of cement

19
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:48,159
that we deal with uh in this thing much

20
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:50,160
like uh spring lawn care. So let me get

21
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:53,038
to the vide tape here hopefully. There

22
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:56,159
we go. Okay. Well, you know, listen, the

23
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:59,120
slow coming out of the spring allows us

24
00:00:56,159 --> 00:01:01,839
to see poa annua in its glory, right?

25
00:00:59,119 --> 00:01:04,079
These perennial types on the old poa

26
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,760
putting greens. Uh this is what a

27
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:08,640
walking around on a golf course in the

28
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:11,040
spring is is all about to really enjoy

29
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:13,439
this and and see the diversity that you

30
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,960
get. And then by uh summertime, you

31
00:01:13,438 --> 00:01:18,478
can't tell the difference. It it looks

32
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:20,000
like a uniform uh stand of grass. Carl,

33
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:21,759
I thought I'd draw, you know, like to

34
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,359
show a picture every once in a while of

35
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:24,879
things going good. Make, you know,

36
00:01:23,359 --> 00:01:27,359
things. We used, we used to do this

37
00:01:24,879 --> 00:01:29,118
during the pandemic, so we always tried

38
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:31,438
to have a picture, make somebody smile.

39
00:01:29,118 --> 00:01:33,599
So, here's somebody out at Sahali, uh,

40
00:01:31,438 --> 00:01:35,599
with his daughters. And I took this

41
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:39,359
picture, Carl, cuz I got a guy wearing

42
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:41,839
those DG shoes, right? Stupid shoes. We

43
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:43,759
keep saying, who wears these shoes? I

44
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:46,640
found a guy in the Pacific Northwest

45
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:48,959
that wears these shoes. Anyway, uh I

46
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:51,599
also al also always love a good uh pet

47
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:53,679
picture and and this is Tyler Warner. Uh

48
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:56,399
I don't know Tyler at all, but he lost

49
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:58,560
Brutus recently and I just love how he

50
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:01,439
says it. This is as emotional as money

51
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:03,680
guys get. Dang dogs are so awesome,

52
00:02:01,438 --> 00:02:05,519
right? I mean, it's just something about

53
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:08,080
a dog in this business that makes

54
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:09,840
everybody smile. We had our fir we had

55
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,840
our really well attended shortcut

56
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:14,479
conference call this week as we've been

57
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:17,039
doing for the last 29 years. And on the

58
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:20,079
docket was mole and vol damage, right?

59
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:22,560
You a lot of more snow cover than usual

60
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,959
left a lot of places uh with some

61
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:27,199
surface scarring. And so in good term,

62
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:29,039
we say get out and roll the darn thing.

63
00:02:27,199 --> 00:02:32,079
That's what you need to do. Get get that

64
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:34,878
lawn uh smoothed out. Um even if you

65
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:36,959
have grub damage, just roll it. I mean,

66
00:02:34,878 --> 00:02:39,199
if the soil's in good shape and and the

67
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:41,360
grass was growing good, just roll it

68
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:43,199
down, get it smooth, and then throw some

69
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:45,760
seed on it. It really isn't any more

70
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:48,959
than that. So, before we get to Carl,

71
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:50,719
you two uh setting Art up for our

72
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:52,959
conversation today, I'll just do a

73
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:54,719
little bit for the week and tie it into

74
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:57,199
some of the things that we heard as

75
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:59,280
observations across the region. So, as

76
00:02:57,199 --> 00:03:02,000
Art said to us earlier and the maps from

77
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:04,158
the forecast uh website that anybody can

78
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,959
access, you know, cooler to the north,

79
00:03:04,158 --> 00:03:08,959
warmer to the south. Um I don't know

80
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:10,560
that we're necessarily falling behind.

81
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:13,598
Looks like we're pretty close to normal

82
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:15,598
in most cases. Uh soils, you know, have

83
00:03:13,598 --> 00:03:18,639
have made an interesting turn. This was

84
00:03:15,598 --> 00:03:21,359
soils last week where we had very few

85
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:24,639
soils in the 50s. And here it is this

86
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:27,920
week, uh really seeing a few more many

87
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:30,079
much more widespread 50s, uh higher 40s

88
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:31,439
and 50s. So things warmed up pretty

89
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,360
quick. And this is why I asked you about

90
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:35,359
the soil stuff, Art, because things

91
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,120
really moved at the 2-in level pretty

92
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,799
quick. Yeah, this I mean this is a time

93
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,799
of year where we really see the soils,

94
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:41,920
especially at 2 in, move around a lot,

95
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:44,159
right? They're tied to the air

96
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:46,238
temperature in some some degree. We've

97
00:03:44,158 --> 00:03:49,519
talked about us being on roller coasters

98
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:51,519
in in terms of of the air temperatures.

99
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:53,200
Yeah, there's some lag. There's some,

100
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:55,280
you know, there's some buffer in the

101
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:57,438
soil, but particularly at this time of

102
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:59,919
year, uh you know, when we're going from

103
00:03:57,438 --> 00:04:02,158
the 30s to the 70s in terms of air

104
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:04,000
temperature, uh you see the soil start

105
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:05,919
to respond to that. So, so since we're

106
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,080
here, we're chatting about this. Uh,

107
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:10,399
obviously the wild card in this thing is

108
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:12,640
moisture. How much does the moisture

109
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,719
then affect that swing at this time of

110
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:16,238
year? Yeah, the the moisture makes a big

111
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:17,918
difference. It's a lot easier to heat up

112
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:20,078
soil when it's dry. You're not heating

113
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:22,639
up all that water in the soil and things

114
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:24,960
like that. So, uh, the the moisture

115
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:27,840
plays a huge role actually at this time

116
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:29,918
of year. So, and so when you look at

117
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:31,599
growth, right, Carl? Uh, and I'm sort of

118
00:04:29,918 --> 00:04:33,758
setting up some other things that we've

119
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,520
talked about, but when you take into

120
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:37,120
account temperature and moisture as

121
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:39,039
you're doing with our grow growth

122
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:41,280
potential here, and you look at the New

123
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:43,120
York metropolitan area, you still see

124
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:45,439
we're really not growing. It's greening

125
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:47,759
up. No question about it. The landscape

126
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:49,680
is greening and and for starting to

127
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:52,080
bloom. We're hearing reports of this.

128
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:54,000
And of course, big disparities between

129
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:56,079
the east end of Long Island and where

130
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,680
Walt Nelson is up in the Aderondex,

131
00:04:56,079 --> 00:04:59,599
right? It's like living in two different

132
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,040
countries. So, it is important to

133
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,639
understand, you know, you when you when

134
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:05,280
you do when you go to the forecast

135
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:06,960
website, make sure it's localized uh for

136
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:09,119
your location or if you're looking for

137
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:11,038
some other location. Now, as we've

138
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:14,160
talked about before, we had a really dry

139
00:05:11,038 --> 00:05:16,159
fall, historically warm and dry fall and

140
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:19,039
that left a lot of grass looking pretty

141
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:21,039
bad already. And so, the even, you know,

142
00:05:19,038 --> 00:05:22,800
it because we're not growing, we might

143
00:05:21,038 --> 00:05:24,959
be green. You can see in this image,

144
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:27,038
we've got a few things that are green,

145
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:29,439
but more things that are brown that have

146
00:05:27,038 --> 00:05:31,199
not recovered. And so, one of the things

147
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:32,800
we talked about, I think this is worthy

148
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:34,720
of some mention, is we've got a lot of

149
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,400
first-time homeowners, right? Even

150
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,560
though it isn't necessarily the best

151
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:41,120
time to get a home, a lot of people are

152
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:43,839
buying homes again. Economy seems to be

153
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:47,038
plugging along. Uh firsttime homeowners

154
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:48,959
are very anxious to sort of get after it

155
00:05:47,038 --> 00:05:50,719
uh and and do some diagnosing of

156
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:53,279
problems. the first thing they run to is

157
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:55,440
a soil test, right? And so I I you know,

158
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:58,879
I will say this image, these images and

159
00:05:55,439 --> 00:06:01,439
this image is completely AI generated

160
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:03,600
and and except for the ribbon. So what

161
00:06:01,439 --> 00:06:05,360
I'm trying to say is, you know, you can

162
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,759
go and test your soil and a lot of

163
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:09,840
people will do it for chemical purposes.

164
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:12,160
We recommend that you just take a put it

165
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:13,758
in your finger, make yourself a ribbon,

166
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,600
right? See, if you get a really long

167
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:17,199
ribbon, means you got a lot of clay.

168
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,120
It's gonna be a little trickier to grow

169
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:21,280
grass in that. it'll hold more water,

170
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:23,038
but it can be difficult if you walk on

171
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:24,799
it a lot, right? And then at the other

172
00:06:23,038 --> 00:06:26,800
end, if you can't even put it together,

173
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:29,120
it doesn't have structure. It might be

174
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:31,360
more sandy. It may need more water to

175
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:33,280
grow some grass. And understanding those

176
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:35,759
physical properties and how the moisture

177
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:39,119
you add is much more important than the

178
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:41,759
nutrients you add uh in most cases um

179
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:43,199
really helps you solve this and sort of

180
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:44,879
break us out of the soil chemical

181
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:46,960
testing because then we go and we run

182
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:49,120
and we do this, right? We run and we go

183
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:51,038
buy products, walk down the aisle, leave

184
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:53,120
with a bunch of products. And the

185
00:06:51,038 --> 00:06:55,360
problem is, as Art told us earlier, it's

186
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:57,759
going to rain this week, right? This

187
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:59,120
weekend, you know, we're looking at, you

188
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:01,120
know, almost, and what I thought you

189
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:03,120
said almost an inch and a half of rain,

190
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:05,598
Art, and we've got the maps and you can

191
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:07,918
see the data. You can go to the forecast

192
00:07:05,598 --> 00:07:10,639
website and see that stuff. But we also

193
00:07:07,918 --> 00:07:13,680
have a runoff model. And the runoff

194
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:15,519
model indicates over the next few days

195
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:17,439
that we got a moderate chance for

196
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:19,839
runoff. And now I I you could look in

197
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:22,079
there and see the map and zone in on

198
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:24,399
where you're at to see if this is an

199
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:27,359
issue. But at a time when we tend to put

200
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:29,120
a lot of stuff on, right? It not as big

201
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,720
of a deal. Nobody's fertilizing in the

202
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,319
summertime very often. You know,

203
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,280
nobody's putting weed and feed into the

204
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:36,560
summertime very often. Nobody's putting

205
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:38,879
insecticide down in the on lawns

206
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,720
especially. So this is a particular time

207
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:43,598
of year we're understanding runoff risk.

208
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:46,080
And this is again the great climate work

209
00:07:43,598 --> 00:07:48,399
that happens over in the climate center.

210
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:49,839
And so we also have this pollinator risk

211
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:51,839
assessment. So you're running out there

212
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:54,079
putting products out. We've also got a

213
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:56,000
model that's looking at flowering and

214
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:58,639
I'm sure we're starting to see some of

215
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,038
these dandelion flowers and early spring

216
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:04,639
ephemerals come into the landscape. So

217
00:08:01,038 --> 00:08:07,360
this is the change. So this was um this

218
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:09,199
was this is today and this is what it's

219
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:11,840
going to be like in another seven days.

220
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:13,840
So the the forecast website gives us

221
00:08:11,839 --> 00:08:15,598
this opportunity to see where we are now

222
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:16,959
and also see the risk if when you're

223
00:08:15,598 --> 00:08:20,240
going to plan what you're going to do

224
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:22,478
for the weekend. So now Carl, here we go

225
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:24,639
in on the website. One of the things

226
00:08:22,478 --> 00:08:26,560
we've sort of I would almost say Art, we

227
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:28,639
didn't pioneer the sort of study of it,

228
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:31,280
but we certainly pioneered the idea of

229
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:33,200
using it to make decisions in a visual

230
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:35,199
way. looking at maps. We were the first

231
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,959
one after this and bringing in a lot of

232
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:39,200
data. And bringing in a lot of data. A

233
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:41,718
lot of data. Lot of data. So, so, so

234
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:44,080
here we have our two seed head control

235
00:08:41,719 --> 00:08:47,040
recommendations uh that we base on.

236
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:49,839
These are base 32 growing degree days.

237
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:52,480
They are. These are our dandelion uh

238
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:54,959
recommendations. And these are base 50

239
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:57,600
that starts at March 15. And I'm going

240
00:08:54,958 --> 00:09:00,239
to leave it there, Carl, because we have

241
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:02,720
predictive models that use growing

242
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:04,879
degree days. And your question for art

243
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:07,278
today is about growing degree days. So

244
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:08,799
is this Can I pass it to you here? Yeah.

245
00:09:07,278 --> 00:09:10,720
So, and one thing you guys have talked

246
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:13,120
on the show before is when should we

247
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,639
start growing degree days? And and Art,

248
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,560
what you've said in the past is you sort

249
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:19,199
of turned it back to us. Well, when do

250
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:21,278
you think it matters to a crabrass seed

251
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,640
that's going to germinate or a bluegrass

252
00:09:21,278 --> 00:09:25,039
weevil that's going to start marching

253
00:09:22,639 --> 00:09:28,799
over there? if there's a if we get 20

254
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:30,719
base 32 degree days in February 10th,

255
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:32,159
does that mean anything? And so I

256
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,519
decided I'm going to look at a little

257
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:35,120
bit of data, right? Art's talking about

258
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:37,039
a lot of data on the website. Just a

259
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:40,480
little bit of data. This is 14 years in

260
00:09:37,039 --> 00:09:42,079
Ithaca, New York, uh 2005 to 2023. So I

261
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:44,000
just looked at how we accumulate those

262
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:46,320
growing degree days, base 32 in the

263
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
spring. Uh so for those watching right

264
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,399
now, you can see uh this is if we start

265
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,919
March 1st, just like a forecast website.

266
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:53,679
Uh, and if we throw out there's two

267
00:09:51,919 --> 00:09:55,759
outlier years that are really early or

268
00:09:53,679 --> 00:09:57,679
really late, but in general we can

269
00:09:55,759 --> 00:09:58,879
expect to hit the 200 growing degree day

270
00:09:57,679 --> 00:10:00,639
mark. That's about when we start

271
00:09:58,879 --> 00:10:02,480
thinking about proxy about when we start

272
00:10:00,639 --> 00:10:04,799
thinking about crab grass pres or

273
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:07,120
something like that. Uh, we have about a

274
00:10:04,799 --> 00:10:08,879
month bracket in there where we may hit

275
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:11,679
that 200 growing degree day mark between

276
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:14,240
March 24th and April 18th in Itha, New

277
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:15,759
York. So then I decided, okay, uh, you

278
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:17,839
know, we we thought, okay, the the

279
00:10:15,759 --> 00:10:19,838
spring is warming with climate change.

280
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:22,079
Should we start maybe February 15th? And

281
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:23,839
that's actually what the Michigan State

282
00:10:22,078 --> 00:10:25,838
uh degree grade tracker does is they

283
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:28,959
start February 15th. Does that change

284
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:30,399
how we we make our actions? Uh so this

285
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:32,719
now you could see it's a little bit more

286
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:34,320
scattered, but actually if we bracket

287
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:36,639
getting rid of those outlier years, it's

288
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:39,440
the same exact dates, March 24th to

289
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:41,679
April 18th, about a month in there where

290
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:43,040
we hit that 200 growing degree mark

291
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:45,359
where we start thinking about doing

292
00:10:43,039 --> 00:10:47,679
stuff. Uh so that's number one is Art, I

293
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:50,079
think you're right, is is uh hey, it it

294
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:51,278
might actually not matter. That's that's

295
00:10:50,078 --> 00:10:53,039
point point number one. And point number

296
00:10:51,278 --> 00:10:54,958
two is you can see in some of these

297
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:57,519
early years when we accumulate stuff in

298
00:10:54,958 --> 00:11:00,159
February these sort of flat lines these

299
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:02,240
stalling years and that is exactly what

300
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:04,319
you're saying art is we accumulate some

301
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:07,519
degree days and then we're cold for 5

302
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:09,440
days 10 days and to us that probably

303
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:12,078
doesn't matter biologically or you know

304
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:14,079
to weeds or to insects. Um so I think

305
00:11:12,078 --> 00:11:15,439
this is rationale from you Art is like

306
00:11:14,078 --> 00:11:17,599
ah I think we're still good with our

307
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:19,360
March first. I mean, I think that's

308
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,720
where I mean, I think location matters,

309
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,079
right? I mean, you looked at Michigan,

310
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,839
but I wonder what this would look like

311
00:11:22,078 --> 00:11:25,919
someplace down in Virginia or something

312
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:29,040
like that. Clearly there I I I think

313
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:30,879
your your graphs show um actually quite

314
00:11:29,039 --> 00:11:33,039
nicely up here in the Northeast. March

315
00:11:30,879 --> 00:11:36,480
March 1st is fine except for maybe an

316
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:38,480
outlier year here or there. Um yeah, in

317
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:40,320
terms of that those plateaus, I guess

318
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:42,480
that's where I'm the meteorologist and

319
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:44,560
you're the biologist. you know, does

320
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:46,800
does a seed or does an insect kind of

321
00:11:44,559 --> 00:11:48,319
put those degree days in the bank and

322
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:52,559
they're able to pull on that? You know,

323
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:54,959
are they there there or not? Um, so I I

324
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:57,799
think we often times I I I think we I I

325
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:59,359
think sometimes, and this may be an

326
00:11:57,799 --> 00:12:01,519
overgeneralization, but I think

327
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:03,278
sometimes when we stall and then you

328
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:05,440
know how it's a light switch sometimes

329
00:12:03,278 --> 00:12:07,439
where it's boom, it was cold and then

330
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:10,480
boom, it's 85 degrees and you're getting

331
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:13,200
a warm rain. you get this what feels

332
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:15,200
like a rebound effect like like you just

333
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:17,759
said it's storing it up art and it's

334
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:19,600
waiting and it responds but I don't know

335
00:12:17,759 --> 00:12:21,919
if it's responding because it stored it

336
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:24,240
up or because we're flipping a switch

337
00:12:21,919 --> 00:12:26,399
and the next day it's just 80 degrees

338
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:28,799
and it's just physiologically ready like

339
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:31,519
we said it's green so it certainly has

340
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:34,559
the solar panels to collect the sunlight

341
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:36,480
and turn it into energy it's just not

342
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:39,278
that the conditions aren't right and I'm

343
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:41,759
wondering does it store it or I you know

344
00:12:39,278 --> 00:12:43,919
this is a question for you but but

345
00:12:41,759 --> 00:12:47,120
here's the this is the other thing right

346
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:49,278
uh is how big the window is right yeah

347
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:51,360
so it's not only when we start hitting

348
00:12:49,278 --> 00:12:53,120
that 200 degree day mark if you want to

349
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:55,039
go back yeah there you go it's how many

350
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:57,440
days we're spending in sort of the the

351
00:12:55,039 --> 00:12:59,360
time we have to do something 200 to 500

352
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:01,279
is what our proxy window is right we're

353
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:03,360
getting late if we're we're doing we're

354
00:13:01,278 --> 00:13:05,439
making that app beyond 500 about the

355
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,720
same for crabrass and this is the chart

356
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,800
I think most people care about

357
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:11,440
especially landscapers who of hundreds

358
00:13:08,799 --> 00:13:14,159
maybe thousands of properties where it

359
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:16,399
takes two three weeks maybe to make an

360
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:19,278
application of pre-emergent herbicide to

361
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:21,278
all of those properties. So uh if I have

362
00:13:19,278 --> 00:13:23,278
longer time spent in that window if it's

363
00:13:21,278 --> 00:13:25,120
generally cooler in in that growing

364
00:13:23,278 --> 00:13:27,200
degree day threshold I can get to all my

365
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:28,959
properties and get pretty good timing.

366
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,720
If it's a shorter window and I I'm

367
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:32,239
really warm and I blow through those

368
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:34,240
degree days I don't have enough time to

369
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:36,159
get to everything. What is a general

370
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:38,079
range in Itha New York? How long do I

371
00:13:36,159 --> 00:13:40,159
spend in that in that sort of ideal

372
00:13:38,078 --> 00:13:43,919
application window? On average, it's

373
00:13:40,159 --> 00:13:45,679
about 20 21 days, 19 days, 3-ish weeks.

374
00:13:43,919 --> 00:13:46,879
So, that's maybe just enough if you're a

375
00:13:45,679 --> 00:13:48,958
landscaper getting to all your

376
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:50,320
properties, right? On the short end, you

377
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:53,439
know, the really warm year, you blow

378
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:56,000
through that in 13 days. 2008, 2018,

379
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:57,680
2023 were really warm years in Ithaca

380
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:01,120
and we had very little time to make

381
00:13:57,679 --> 00:14:04,319
those apps. Some years, 2020, 2016, you

382
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:06,000
had 30, 33 days spent in that window. So

383
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:08,480
this is a big, you know, that's three

384
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,320
times as long really as as the shortest

385
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:12,560
year. Yeah. So this is this is

386
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:14,240
interesting, Carl, because and Art, you

387
00:14:12,559 --> 00:14:16,319
said location matters. All right. So

388
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:20,480
we're up in Ithaca, centrally isolated

389
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:23,680
up here in Ithaca. If we were in Jersey,

390
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:26,240
where our brother Rich Buckley is, um or

391
00:14:23,679 --> 00:14:29,638
or even, you know, where our, you know,

392
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:32,879
our turf programs in Virginia Tech are.

393
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:35,680
Um, do you think this window's narrower

394
00:14:32,879 --> 00:14:39,278
narrow narrower? N Yeah, I can't say

395
00:14:35,679 --> 00:14:43,599
that word. Uh, not as widearrow. Narrow

396
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:46,240
as you get uh further south.

397
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:48,639
Um, I I knew you were going there and I

398
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:53,919
was thinking about it. Um, I I Well, you

399
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:57,680
set it up. Yeah. Um, I my my intuition

400
00:14:53,919 --> 00:15:00,319
is the window will not get much narrower

401
00:14:57,679 --> 00:15:03,759
as you go south. what the window will do

402
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:06,320
is move earlier in the year, but the but

403
00:15:03,759 --> 00:15:08,799
the width of that window is is really

404
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:10,560
going to change quite a bit. Um, you

405
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:12,639
know, I I guess I hesitate a little bit.

406
00:15:10,559 --> 00:15:14,399
I could see the the warm up coming a

407
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:15,839
little bit quicker. Or, you know, if you

408
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:18,639
even think of what we've been having

409
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:20,959
lately with these warm spells where, you

410
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:23,278
know, we we get up up here in upstate,

411
00:15:20,958 --> 00:15:25,599
we might get up into the the 60s, upper

412
00:15:23,278 --> 00:15:27,679
60s and think it's great, but when you

413
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:29,680
you know, when I when I call down to my

414
00:15:27,679 --> 00:15:32,239
family in New Jersey or Philly, they're

415
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:34,319
up in the, you know, 70s almost 80s. So,

416
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:37,278
you are accumulating a lot more degree

417
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:39,839
days there. So, uh, that that might

418
00:15:37,278 --> 00:15:42,240
might affect things in some years, but I

419
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:44,959
think overall I' I'd expect to see the

420
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:46,720
same same window size.

421
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:49,198
It's interesting, Carl, because this is

422
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:50,959
a knowable thing. I mean, you could sit

423
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:53,679
there and ask the machine a simple

424
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:55,919
question like on average, what's, you

425
00:15:53,679 --> 00:15:57,519
know, what's the ideal time, right? I

426
00:15:55,919 --> 00:16:00,000
mean, you have this window and your

427
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:02,639
window is from when it starts to when

428
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,799
it's not any good anymore, but there's

429
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:07,680
this period of time where it's ideal,

430
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:10,799
which is maybe its own range. Is this

431
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:13,278
ideal or this is just it'll work if you

432
00:16:10,799 --> 00:16:15,519
put it down at this time. This is the

433
00:16:13,278 --> 00:16:18,159
ideal range. Yep. So, and if you bracket

434
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:20,720
on the ends, a marginal, we could also

435
00:16:18,159 --> 00:16:22,240
look at that too. And Right. And and

436
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:24,720
then when you start thinking about, as

437
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:26,799
Randy tells us all the time, early down,

438
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:29,920
early gone, right? If you're you looking

439
00:16:26,799 --> 00:16:32,319
at a pre that doesn't last as long

440
00:16:29,919 --> 00:16:33,838
because you put it out early, you know

441
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:36,320
what we don't know is how much

442
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:38,160
degradation or movement of it happens in

443
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:39,920
the spring as soils warm and things

444
00:16:38,159 --> 00:16:41,679
break down. But but we know they don't

445
00:16:39,919 --> 00:16:43,599
last more than 10 12 weeks. Some of

446
00:16:41,679 --> 00:16:45,838
these pre-emergence, maybe barricade

447
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:47,920
could be 14 or longer. But if you're

448
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:49,759
going with team like a homeowner might

449
00:16:47,919 --> 00:16:51,838
be doing, that one's only going to give

450
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:54,560
you six or seven, maybe eight weeks of

451
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:57,199
crab grass control. And crabrass prop

452
00:16:54,559 --> 00:16:59,198
pressures well into July now. So you're

453
00:16:57,198 --> 00:17:01,758
you're burned out by then. So this

454
00:16:59,198 --> 00:17:04,318
window becomes more important for

455
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:06,959
something that wears out like that. Uh

456
00:17:04,318 --> 00:17:09,279
and less important for a proxy because

457
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:11,919
you just need to hit it, right? And most

458
00:17:09,279 --> 00:17:14,318
of these guys, this is a followup

459
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:15,919
spring. you know, you're locking in seed

460
00:17:14,318 --> 00:17:18,000
head suppression in the fall and that's

461
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:20,559
a whole another area study. So, Carl,

462
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:23,599
listen, we've sort of I I think

463
00:17:20,558 --> 00:17:25,678
concluded here now, you know, we talked

464
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:27,438
earlier that the grass isn't growing,

465
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:29,600
but yet every, you know, they see it's

466
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:32,558
green, they want to be on it. Even

467
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:34,558
Bellich, we found out this week, is

468
00:17:32,558 --> 00:17:38,160
ripping out synthetic turf to put

469
00:17:34,558 --> 00:17:40,720
natural grass, and that's the guy that

470
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:42,400
ripped out natural grass in the middle

471
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:44,079
of the season, got himself in some

472
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:46,080
trouble, and then they started playing

473
00:17:44,079 --> 00:17:48,639
on synthetic turf in New England. So,

474
00:17:46,079 --> 00:17:52,119
apparently Dr. Bellich there has changed

475
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:54,720
his tune. But Carl, these multi-purpose

476
00:17:52,119 --> 00:17:57,678
surfaces have a role as we've talked

477
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:59,519
about in the spring. But, uh, when you

478
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:01,679
get in the summertime, it starts to

479
00:17:59,519 --> 00:18:03,400
cause a problem. And Art, you also have

480
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:05,919
experience of this, both in your

481
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:08,320
meteorological world and in your world

482
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:10,080
as a soccer ref. So, we're going to want

483
00:18:08,319 --> 00:18:12,079
to draw on that, Carl. Let's hear from

484
00:18:10,079 --> 00:18:13,359
it. Let's hear from you. Yes. I I wanted

485
00:18:12,079 --> 00:18:15,359
to start with the summer. This is when

486
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:16,798
everybody thinks about uh synthetic

487
00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:18,879
turf. It gets really hot, and that's a

488
00:18:16,798 --> 00:18:20,319
bad thing. Uh, in the spring, if it get

489
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:21,760
warms up, it's actually a good thing, I

490
00:18:20,319 --> 00:18:23,439
think, for us when when we need it in

491
00:18:21,759 --> 00:18:25,919
the shoulders of the season. But, uh,

492
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:28,558
this image is just showing 89.2 to

493
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:30,840
Celsius is what synthetic turf can some

494
00:18:28,558 --> 00:18:33,279
synthetic systems can get to. I mean,

495
00:18:30,839 --> 00:18:34,879
that's 170 or something. We're getting

496
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:37,359
to a really crazy that's up there,

497
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:39,919
right? It boil water boils at 100. So,

498
00:18:37,359 --> 00:18:41,519
you ain't too far off from there. Um and

499
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:44,480
and Art, I was reviewing some of the

500
00:18:41,519 --> 00:18:46,160
stuff. Um high solar absorptivity and if

501
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:48,400
you go back to that slide, yep, the two

502
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:51,600
primary factors of why, you know, why is

503
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:53,840
it so hot? High solar absorivity and

504
00:18:51,599 --> 00:18:55,599
water evaporation. So maybe Art from a

505
00:18:53,839 --> 00:18:57,839
physics perspective, you could just

506
00:18:55,599 --> 00:19:00,079
explain those just why is it so hot? I

507
00:18:57,839 --> 00:19:01,839
think Go easy, Art. I'll go easy. We got

508
00:19:00,079 --> 00:19:05,038
a few Penn State people listening. So

509
00:19:01,839 --> 00:19:07,759
you got Okay, I I can I can I can I can

510
00:19:05,038 --> 00:19:09,679
dumb it down then. Um yeah, I mean

511
00:19:07,759 --> 00:19:12,000
actually the physics isn't all that

512
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:14,160
complicated. We do this in my intro to

513
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,480
physics class actually. Right. There's

514
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,840
there's three ingredients and Carl Carl

515
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:20,240
kind of hits it, right? There's the

516
00:19:17,839 --> 00:19:22,639
incoming solar radiation. That's the

517
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:24,798
energy coming into the system and once

518
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:27,280
that energy comes in I would say three

519
00:19:24,798 --> 00:19:29,519
things can happen. It can reflect, it

520
00:19:27,279 --> 00:19:33,119
can be absorbed or it can evaporate

521
00:19:29,519 --> 00:19:35,279
water. So basically right if think um I

522
00:19:33,119 --> 00:19:37,678
would say the the reflectivity of

523
00:19:35,279 --> 00:19:39,359
natural grass and synthetic turf is

524
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:41,919
probably about the same. I don't think

525
00:19:39,359 --> 00:19:43,918
you get a a big difference there. But

526
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:46,640
but what you do do is I mean the

527
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:49,360
absorptivity goes up the darker the

528
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:52,320
surface is right. in in I I know what

529
00:19:49,359 --> 00:19:55,359
Carl's next slide is, right? Um those

530
00:19:52,319 --> 00:19:57,119
darker surfaces uh absorb a lot of solar

531
00:19:55,359 --> 00:19:59,759
energy and once they absorb it, they

532
00:19:57,119 --> 00:20:01,119
have to do something with it and uh one

533
00:19:59,759 --> 00:20:03,200
of the things is increase their

534
00:20:01,119 --> 00:20:05,599
temperature. Uh the other thing they can

535
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:07,279
do is evaporate water. So if you're

536
00:20:05,599 --> 00:20:08,798
taking a system that no longer

537
00:20:07,279 --> 00:20:10,319
evapotranspirates,

538
00:20:08,798 --> 00:20:12,079
um you have more of that energy going

539
00:20:10,319 --> 00:20:15,678
into upping the temperature as opposed

540
00:20:12,079 --> 00:20:16,879
to evaporating water. Yeah. And this is

541
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:18,640
one of the things we've learned, Frank,

542
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:20,240
is is these systems are great. They

543
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:22,720
flush the water. They don't hold any

544
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:24,480
water. Yep. Which is uh great for

545
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:26,480
playing on the field all the time, but

546
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:28,640
but not great from a storm storm water

547
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:30,240
perspective. So So here we're gonna, you

548
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:32,000
know, they always say it's not rocket

549
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:34,079
science, right, Frank? This is actual

550
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:37,200
rocket science. This is from NASA. Uh so

551
00:20:34,079 --> 00:20:39,359
these are absorptivity coefficients of

552
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:41,600
various black coatings they can put on

553
00:20:39,359 --> 00:20:45,199
rockets and white coatings. And the high

554
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:48,639
numbers on the left 8.9 is how much of

555
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:50,679
that solar radiation it holds versus

556
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:52,960
white coatings

557
00:20:50,679 --> 00:20:55,759
3.1 2. So there's just the you know the

558
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:57,519
physics around a black a dark surface is

559
00:20:55,759 --> 00:20:59,440
going to hold more of that absorptivity

560
00:20:57,519 --> 00:21:00,879
and in the background we have a black

561
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:02,798
synthetic field that was put in at

562
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:05,520
Morrisville and Ari were just talking

563
00:21:02,798 --> 00:21:07,519
before you have refed on this field. So,

564
00:21:05,519 --> 00:21:09,519
as a ref, you know, sort of get setting

565
00:21:07,519 --> 00:21:11,759
aside your expertise as a climate

566
00:21:09,519 --> 00:21:13,119
scientist, what were your thoughts when

567
00:21:11,759 --> 00:21:15,279
uh when you were refing a game on this

568
00:21:13,119 --> 00:21:17,279
field? I I always want it to be a cloudy

569
00:21:15,279 --> 00:21:19,038
day when I go to Marsville basically

570
00:21:17,279 --> 00:21:21,519
because it sucks when it's when it's

571
00:21:19,038 --> 00:21:23,440
when it's sunny. And I mean I even going

572
00:21:21,519 --> 00:21:26,158
late in the season. I know this past

573
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:28,400
season I refed up there. It was oh you

574
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:31,679
know end of October basically at least

575
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:33,600
midocctober and bright sunny day and and

576
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:35,679
you know the the air temperature was

577
00:21:33,599 --> 00:21:39,359
wonderful off the field but on the field

578
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:43,038
it was just hot and dry. Um just not not

579
00:21:39,359 --> 00:21:45,199
a good thing. All right Carl. And and so

580
00:21:43,038 --> 00:21:46,879
this is and and as a high school ref Art

581
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:49,120
I looked in the New York State you know

582
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:52,000
public high school athletic association.

583
00:21:49,119 --> 00:21:53,918
They refer every uh sort of person

584
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,599
responsible for are we going to play a

585
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:57,360
game or not when it comes to heat stress

586
00:21:55,599 --> 00:21:59,199
to wet bulb globe temperature and

587
00:21:57,359 --> 00:22:00,719
there's a weather bug app that you can

588
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:02,880
go on to. We we've talked a little bit

589
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:04,960
in the past about wet bulb globe

590
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:07,360
temperature. Just a a brief primer on

591
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:09,600
sort of what is that looking at from an

592
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:11,519
athletes perspective heat stress. It's

593
00:22:09,599 --> 00:22:13,199
more than just the air temperature,

594
00:22:11,519 --> 00:22:14,879
right? Yeah. I mean it's there's been a

595
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,720
whole progression in these things. IO

596
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:18,720
first it was the air temperature then it

597
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:20,400
was what the the the temperature

598
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:22,000
humidity index that brought in the

599
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:24,320
amount of moisture and then really what

600
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,679
this wet bulb globe temperature is is

601
00:22:24,319 --> 00:22:28,000
really brings in everything the

602
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:30,080
temperature the humidity the wind speed

603
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,480
and uh I think most importantly the

604
00:22:30,079 --> 00:22:36,558
solar radiation right again you think of

605
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:38,400
a a nice sunny uh day up here in spring

606
00:22:36,558 --> 00:22:41,279
and you know might feels pretty good

607
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:43,759
when it's uh 60° out it doesn't feel the

608
00:22:41,279 --> 00:22:45,599
same on a cloudy day so that the body

609
00:22:43,759 --> 00:22:48,158
absorbs absorbing that solar energy just

610
00:22:45,599 --> 00:22:49,839
like the synthetic turf um actually

611
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:51,440
helps quite a bit in that in that

612
00:22:49,839 --> 00:22:53,678
temperature and that's that's what

613
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:56,000
they're doing. So So is this the feels

614
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:57,919
like

615
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,558
it's it's the feels like temperature on

616
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:02,960
steroids, Frank. It it it kind of it's

617
00:23:00,558 --> 00:23:05,440
the extension of that. Okay. So So all

618
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:07,200
right. So this is the New York State

619
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:09,919
Public High School Athletic Association.

620
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:12,159
I'm assuming the NCAA's got another one.

621
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:14,559
How does this work in practical terms?

622
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:16,799
All right. Have you confronted this in

623
00:23:14,558 --> 00:23:19,038
any way where because let me just step

624
00:23:16,798 --> 00:23:21,279
back. I've chatted with some people who

625
00:23:19,038 --> 00:23:23,279
manage natural grass fields in the south

626
00:23:21,279 --> 00:23:25,599
and synthetic fields in the south and

627
00:23:23,279 --> 00:23:27,599
they got this rule down there and

628
00:23:25,599 --> 00:23:29,918
they've never cancelled the game on

629
00:23:27,599 --> 00:23:33,599
synthetic turf. So I just wanted for the

630
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:36,159
record while this is there I wonder how

631
00:23:33,599 --> 00:23:38,319
it actually gets implemented and if it's

632
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:40,080
not implemented you know because

633
00:23:38,319 --> 00:23:41,839
everybody wants to get the game in. It's

634
00:23:40,079 --> 00:23:44,839
the same thing with rain on a field.

635
00:23:41,839 --> 00:23:47,519
they want to get the game in. Um, you

636
00:23:44,839 --> 00:23:49,918
know, how does this h actually happen in

637
00:23:47,519 --> 00:23:52,720
practice? So, I've had high school games

638
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:54,720
either canceled or delayed because of

639
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:56,558
the New York State rule. And basically

640
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:58,480
there again, it's kind of it's the

641
00:23:56,558 --> 00:24:00,319
athletic director at the field looking

642
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:02,558
at his phone to the Weatherbug app and

643
00:24:00,319 --> 00:24:04,798
and telling, you know, Weatherbug in in

644
00:24:02,558 --> 00:24:06,319
this city is saying this and, you know,

645
00:24:04,798 --> 00:24:08,400
we're either delaying the start of the

646
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:10,319
game if it's close or or or we're

647
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:12,798
canceling the game. Totally. Totally

648
00:24:10,319 --> 00:24:15,359
that call. Um, I've never had a college

649
00:24:12,798 --> 00:24:16,960
game cancelled uh because of the heat,

650
00:24:15,359 --> 00:24:19,199
although I've definitely been out there

651
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:21,038
on some very very hot days. You know,

652
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:23,120
standing at midfield before the game at

653
00:24:21,038 --> 00:24:26,480
the national anthem and and basically

654
00:24:23,119 --> 00:24:30,000
just sweating like crazy. Um, so I I am

655
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:32,000
not familiar with what the NCAA rule is

656
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,679
there. I know in a lot of cases the game

657
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,599
will go and we'll have more frequent

658
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:37,840
water breaks and things like that. You

659
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:40,000
see that in professional soccer as well.

660
00:24:37,839 --> 00:24:42,240
Um, but to my knowledge there's not a a

661
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:44,400
cut off like in high school. Is this is

662
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:46,240
this a good metric art? I guess that's

663
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:48,640
the question. Like if we were going to

664
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:51,599
pursue this and you were an athletic

665
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:53,520
field manager, you know, at a university

666
00:24:51,599 --> 00:24:55,359
or at a really, you know, nice high

667
00:24:53,519 --> 00:24:57,679
school where there's high expectations

668
00:24:55,359 --> 00:25:00,000
and you've got one of these carpets. Um,

669
00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:02,320
and this is more likely something, as

670
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:05,839
Carl said, they'll encounter when they

671
00:25:02,319 --> 00:25:08,158
get back in August for play. Rarely are

672
00:25:05,839 --> 00:25:10,079
we worried about this thing uh up north

673
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:11,600
because actually it's desirable now,

674
00:25:10,079 --> 00:25:14,720
right? It's a place where you can get

675
00:25:11,599 --> 00:25:18,399
out there. So So I'm I'm wondering about

676
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:22,000
is this a good uh measure of what you

677
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:25,440
think is uh simple enough for them to

678
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:27,359
use a and also actually protecting,

679
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:29,200
right? You need some kind of measure. I

680
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:31,278
agree with that. Uh where I think this

681
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:33,519
might go astray a little bit is is it

682
00:25:31,278 --> 00:25:35,759
goes back to natural versus artificial

683
00:25:33,519 --> 00:25:36,720
turf, right? So all these measurements,

684
00:25:35,759 --> 00:25:38,480
measurements you're getting from

685
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:40,480
Weatherbug and things like that, they're

686
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:41,759
clearly not over artificial turf. You

687
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:43,839
know, most of those measurements are

688
00:25:41,759 --> 00:25:46,000
coming from at least something that's in

689
00:25:43,839 --> 00:25:48,720
a a more favorable environment to to

690
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,798
produce a cooler temperature. So um you

691
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:53,038
are, you know, that that skews things

692
00:25:50,798 --> 00:25:55,038
quite a bit. So I mean really there

693
00:25:53,038 --> 00:25:57,440
should be, you know, if you wanted to do

694
00:25:55,038 --> 00:26:00,158
this uh the right way, there should be

695
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:03,120
some special onsite type measurements of

696
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:05,039
of doing this. So this could be also

697
00:26:03,119 --> 00:26:06,959
something that if you got enough data

698
00:26:05,038 --> 00:26:08,798
from different fields, you could model

699
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:10,960
just like you do everything else, right,

700
00:26:08,798 --> 00:26:12,798
Art? Yeah. And I mean again, it's just

701
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:15,120
not the temperature. You know, Carl

702
00:26:12,798 --> 00:26:16,798
started off with 80°C at the turf

703
00:26:15,119 --> 00:26:19,038
surface and looked like he was showing

704
00:26:16,798 --> 00:26:20,639
that from an infrared thermometer. So

705
00:26:19,038 --> 00:26:22,798
right there at the surface. So yeah,

706
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:25,038
maybe uh maybe you could fry an egg.

707
00:26:22,798 --> 00:26:27,519
Your shoes I mean that's going back yet

708
00:26:25,038 --> 00:26:29,599
your feet are very hot on these surfaces

709
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:31,119
when you referee. you know, up at body

710
00:26:29,599 --> 00:26:32,480
level there's a difference and that

711
00:26:31,119 --> 00:26:35,359
difference is going to matter whether

712
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:37,480
it's a real windy day or a calm day and

713
00:26:35,359 --> 00:26:39,759
things like that. So, there is some

714
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:42,079
variation even in there within the

715
00:26:39,759 --> 00:26:43,359
height of a typical athlete. Yeah. And

716
00:26:42,079 --> 00:26:44,798
then even with with the different

717
00:26:43,359 --> 00:26:46,558
synthetic surfaces, right, Frank, we're

718
00:26:44,798 --> 00:26:49,359
learning more about alternative infills

719
00:26:46,558 --> 00:26:52,480
and there's ones that purport to be a

720
00:26:49,359 --> 00:26:54,240
lot cooler. They hold water and you will

721
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:56,720
irrigate those fields and it holds water

722
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:59,200
and you get that evaporative cooling. It

723
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:01,919
probably won't last very long if I had

724
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:03,840
to guess. Maybe maybe half an hour or

725
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:05,600
something like that. You see this on

726
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:07,278
campus, right? They're they they spray

727
00:27:05,599 --> 00:27:09,119
their they're irrigating the at least

728
00:27:07,278 --> 00:27:11,278
they do it at the field hockey field. I

729
00:27:09,119 --> 00:27:13,839
assume that's for ball play but also for

730
00:27:11,278 --> 00:27:15,839
for some cooling. Yeah, there's no

731
00:27:13,839 --> 00:27:18,720
question about it that this remain I

732
00:27:15,839 --> 00:27:21,359
mean listen this is a part of every

733
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:23,679
everybody that's managing uh natural

734
00:27:21,359 --> 00:27:25,918
grass surfaces at a high level is man

735
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:27,759
managing synthetic surfaces. It's just

736
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:30,400
the nature of the people that we service

737
00:27:27,759 --> 00:27:32,079
in this work. And I think what I like

738
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:34,080
about this and I think always have said

739
00:27:32,079 --> 00:27:36,079
about this with sports fields, sports

740
00:27:34,079 --> 00:27:38,399
has liability that just about every

741
00:27:36,079 --> 00:27:40,240
other part of turf doesn't have, right?

742
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:42,400
And you know, kids can get hurt. And I

743
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:44,159
think to your point, Art, these laws are

744
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:45,840
a little bit these recommendations a

745
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:47,919
little bit more stringent on youth

746
00:27:45,839 --> 00:27:49,519
fields. And and I think when you're

747
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:51,038
younger, you not only are you closer to

748
00:27:49,519 --> 00:27:52,960
the ground, but I'd say when you're a

749
00:27:51,038 --> 00:27:54,319
peanut, you're spending a lot of time on

750
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:56,159
the ground. On the ground. On the

751
00:27:54,319 --> 00:27:57,678
ground. So that so that that does bring

752
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:59,679
the measurement into play. All right,

753
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:02,080
Carl, we're getting close. Uh any

754
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:04,480
questions from the field or any more

755
00:28:02,079 --> 00:28:06,079
final questions from you? Uh we no

756
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:08,079
questions yet, but uh I did want to

757
00:28:06,079 --> 00:28:10,319
point out on this chart you see region

758
00:28:08,079 --> 00:28:12,079
one, two, and three. And the cuto offs

759
00:28:10,319 --> 00:28:13,759
for sort of low threat, moderate threat,

760
00:28:12,079 --> 00:28:15,359
high threat are different for those.

761
00:28:13,759 --> 00:28:19,200
Those are the regions of the country you

762
00:28:15,359 --> 00:28:22,879
live in. Basically, how acclimated your

763
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:24,080
kids are to heat matters in how you will

764
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:25,840
change the play of the game. So if

765
00:28:24,079 --> 00:28:27,839
you're from the south and you're used to

766
00:28:25,839 --> 00:28:29,519
warmer temperatures, that would be

767
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:30,558
region three here that the cutoff is a

768
00:28:29,519 --> 00:28:32,480
little bit higher because you're used to

769
00:28:30,558 --> 00:28:34,960
that a little bit. Um if you're up in

770
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:36,640
the aderondex, uh actually within New

771
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:38,558
York State, we would be cut into two

772
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:40,240
different regions. So actually public

773
00:28:38,558 --> 00:28:43,200
high school events played in the north

774
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:45,679
country would be subject to region one

775
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:46,880
versus region two for more downstate. I

776
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:48,480
think that's something that probably

777
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:49,520
gets overlooked, but is is sort of

778
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:51,200
interesting. Like, wow, in New York

779
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:53,119
State, we have two different sort of

780
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:54,720
Well, it would explain a little bit why,

781
00:28:53,119 --> 00:28:56,558
you know, maybe games in the South

782
00:28:54,720 --> 00:29:00,000
aren't canceled. To your point, Carl,

783
00:28:56,558 --> 00:29:03,038
they may be uh as a population, uh more

784
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,960
more heat acclimated. Um so, so listen,

785
00:29:03,038 --> 00:29:06,640
Art, thanks for taking the time to join

786
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:08,640
us. It's it's really great to have

787
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:10,399
always fun to be with you guys. Yeah,

788
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:12,559
this is great. Hey, Carl, who do we got

789
00:29:10,398 --> 00:29:13,759
next week? We're gonna have Evan Machete

790
00:29:12,558 --> 00:29:15,839
on next week. So, we're going to be

791
00:29:13,759 --> 00:29:17,519
talking sports turf again and Evan is

792
00:29:15,839 --> 00:29:19,359
going to be one of the experts on we're

793
00:29:17,519 --> 00:29:22,000
gonna ask him about traction. We don't

794
00:29:19,359 --> 00:29:23,519
have a good idea of best ways to manage

795
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,919
traction. Evan's probably one of the

796
00:29:23,519 --> 00:29:28,879
experts in the entire world on using

797
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:30,559
some pretty advanced machinery to uh to

798
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:33,039
measure that. So, it'll be it'll be a

799
00:29:30,558 --> 00:29:34,240
fun next week uh with Thanks a lot, Art.
