1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,669
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:08,580
University I'm glad to see everyone here

3
00:00:05,669 --> 00:00:10,050
for the mixtures session so my name is

4
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:12,780
Charlie white I'm a research associate

5
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:15,109
at Penn State and I feel very lucky to

6
00:00:12,779 --> 00:00:18,149
be representing a big team of

7
00:00:15,108 --> 00:00:21,230
researchers and extension educators and

8
00:00:18,149 --> 00:00:23,358
Farmar collaborators and organization

9
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:25,679
organizations that work with us to share

10
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:28,830
some results from our cover crop

11
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:30,390
mixtures research experiment that we've

12
00:00:28,829 --> 00:00:33,149
been doing it at Penn State and on

13
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:34,289
collaborating farms so if any of you

14
00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:35,759
have traveled around the countryside

15
00:00:34,289 --> 00:00:38,820
this time of year you've probably seen

16
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:42,628
tents like this cropping up in in cover

17
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:44,009
crop fields around around your areas and

18
00:00:42,628 --> 00:00:46,589
if you were to wander inside one of

19
00:00:44,009 --> 00:00:49,170
those tents you might find a cover crop

20
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:51,930
evangelist like this preaching about the

21
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:53,870
benefits of cover crop mixtures this is

22
00:00:51,929 --> 00:00:56,579
Ray Archuleta how many of you've seen

23
00:00:53,869 --> 00:00:59,549
presentations by Ray Archuleta okay so

24
00:00:56,579 --> 00:01:01,350
there's a lot of benefits potential

25
00:00:59,549 --> 00:01:02,608
benefits that cover crop mixtures can

26
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:05,728
provide and we're hearing a lot about

27
00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:08,460
those out in the farming community and

28
00:01:05,728 --> 00:01:10,260
and on the extension circuit and there's

29
00:01:08,459 --> 00:01:12,239
some good information good background

30
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:15,359
information that has led to this belief

31
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:18,658
in the benefit of cover crop mixtures so

32
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:20,719
there's a long-standing hypothesis the

33
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:24,840
biodiversity ecosystem function

34
00:01:20,719 --> 00:01:27,329
hypothesis that says you know as we

35
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:29,640
increase diversity in a field were

36
00:01:27,329 --> 00:01:32,459
increasing the services and the

37
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:35,849
functionality that can be provided and

38
00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:37,559
these functions could be plant biomass

39
00:01:35,849 --> 00:01:40,530
production they could be weed

40
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:43,200
suppression beneficial insects nitrogen

41
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:47,189
retention nitrogen supply and so on and

42
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:50,159
so forth so our team our very large team

43
00:01:47,188 --> 00:01:52,019
wanted to address this specifically

44
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:54,868
related to cover crop mixtures can we

45
00:01:52,019 --> 00:01:58,890
increase the functionality and service

46
00:01:54,868 --> 00:02:00,629
provisioning of mixtures in a cover

47
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:03,000
cropping system so like I said there's a

48
00:02:00,629 --> 00:02:05,368
very large team and everyone on this

49
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,610
team has contributed to the work that

50
00:02:05,368 --> 00:02:10,348
I'll be presenting this afternoon and

51
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:12,930
it's been funded through two projects

52
00:02:10,348 --> 00:02:17,699
funded by the OREA

53
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:20,280
Ram okay so the main experiment is at

54
00:02:17,699 --> 00:02:22,408
the Rock Springs Research Station we're

55
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:23,640
using at least the phase of the

56
00:02:22,408 --> 00:02:26,250
experiment that I'm going to describe

57
00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:28,649
today the first three years we use these

58
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:31,169
six species in the experiment so we have

59
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:34,739
two legumes red clover and Austrian

60
00:02:31,169 --> 00:02:38,188
winter pea we have two brassicas canola

61
00:02:34,739 --> 00:02:42,658
and forage radish two grasses cereal rye

62
00:02:38,188 --> 00:02:45,560
and oats and these plant families are

63
00:02:42,658 --> 00:02:48,750
also crossed with winter hardiness

64
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:51,239
classes so all of these species up here

65
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:53,789
on the top these are all reliably winter

66
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:56,099
hardy species in our climate of central

67
00:02:53,789 --> 00:02:57,628
Pennsylvania and these species on the

68
00:02:56,098 --> 00:03:01,138
bottom these are all winter killed

69
00:02:57,628 --> 00:03:02,848
mostly winter killed Austin winter pea

70
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:04,560
it kind of depends when you plant it but

71
00:03:02,848 --> 00:03:08,098
more often than not in our climate it's

72
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:09,389
been winter killing so we have we have

73
00:03:08,098 --> 00:03:11,098
these six different species that

74
00:03:09,389 --> 00:03:14,760
represent different plant families

75
00:03:11,098 --> 00:03:16,500
different growth patterns in time and we

76
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:19,888
used we planted those six species and

77
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:23,340
monocultures as control comparisons and

78
00:03:19,889 --> 00:03:26,040
then we also created four mixtures out

79
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:29,000
of those six species and the mixtures we

80
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:32,818
assembled to target different functional

81
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:35,250
functional goals and also to have a

82
00:03:32,818 --> 00:03:38,298
gradient of species diversity so we have

83
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:42,120
the three species n treatment which has

84
00:03:38,299 --> 00:03:44,009
clover P and rye and this is a focused

85
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:46,199
on nitrogen management so the rise in

86
00:03:44,008 --> 00:03:48,598
their to scavenge nitrogen in the winter

87
00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:50,699
these are all planted after winter wheat

88
00:03:48,598 --> 00:03:52,738
and going into corn so we also want a

89
00:03:50,699 --> 00:03:54,419
supply nitrogen to the corn crops so

90
00:03:52,739 --> 00:03:57,628
we've got the clover and the pea in

91
00:03:54,419 --> 00:04:00,150
there the three species W that's for

92
00:03:57,628 --> 00:04:01,768
weed management this is in an organic

93
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:03,539
cropping system experiment so we're not

94
00:04:01,769 --> 00:04:05,759
using any herbicides so we're looking

95
00:04:03,539 --> 00:04:08,608
for the cover crop to provide some weed

96
00:04:05,758 --> 00:04:11,638
suppression services so we have oat in

97
00:04:08,609 --> 00:04:14,069
there as a fast growing species and then

98
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:16,139
rye is a high biomass species in the

99
00:04:14,068 --> 00:04:18,469
spring and because we're going into corn

100
00:04:16,139 --> 00:04:21,629
we wanted to have some nitrogen as well

101
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:22,830
so we have the clover in there for

102
00:04:21,629 --> 00:04:25,620
species mix so we're starting to

103
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:26,430
increase in species diversity we have a

104
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:29,069
clove

105
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:31,168
p and rise so those are the same three

106
00:04:29,069 --> 00:04:33,569
species that we have up here but now

107
00:04:31,168 --> 00:04:35,579
we're adding canola as well and canola

108
00:04:33,569 --> 00:04:38,339
being abrasca has some interesting

109
00:04:35,579 --> 00:04:40,769
tissue chemistry it's also a species

110
00:04:38,339 --> 00:04:42,329
that will flower or relatively early in

111
00:04:40,769 --> 00:04:44,909
the spring so we're getting from

112
00:04:42,329 --> 00:04:46,680
flowering the canola is flowering before

113
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:49,259
terminating it and the idea is that we

114
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:51,449
can attract some beneficial insects or

115
00:04:49,259 --> 00:04:53,669
provide a habitat and resources for

116
00:04:51,449 --> 00:04:55,710
native bee populations with the canola

117
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:58,019
and then we've got our six species mix

118
00:04:55,709 --> 00:05:01,469
here which is kind of the high diversity

119
00:04:58,019 --> 00:05:03,240
mix for our experiment and we're just

120
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:05,310
looking to maximize diversity and

121
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:08,129
hopefully if our theory is right

122
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:13,079
maximize the services and benefits that

123
00:05:08,129 --> 00:05:15,149
we get from the mixture okay so we're

124
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:16,769
looking at multi functionality of these

125
00:05:15,149 --> 00:05:18,418
cover crops that we've measured lots of

126
00:05:16,769 --> 00:05:21,329
different services that they're

127
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:23,939
providing and I'll just go around here

128
00:05:21,329 --> 00:05:26,550
so biomass production above-ground

129
00:05:23,939 --> 00:05:29,219
biomass we harvested in the fall and the

130
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:31,379
spring nitrogen retention this is an

131
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:34,650
anion exchange resin bag we buried this

132
00:05:31,379 --> 00:05:36,418
at 25 centimeters when we plant the

133
00:05:34,649 --> 00:05:38,698
cover crop in the fall and then we dig

134
00:05:36,418 --> 00:05:40,680
that up in the spring and we can extract

135
00:05:38,699 --> 00:05:42,930
the nitrate that leach through the soil

136
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:45,598
profile through this bag there and scale

137
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:47,610
that up to an aerial basis we're

138
00:05:45,598 --> 00:05:49,918
measuring nitrogen supply and here we

139
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:52,348
actually use a biogeochemical model to

140
00:05:49,918 --> 00:05:54,389
predict the nitrogen availability based

141
00:05:52,348 --> 00:05:57,418
on the c2n ratio and the total end

142
00:05:54,389 --> 00:05:58,860
content of the cover crop biomass we're

143
00:05:57,418 --> 00:06:01,978
measuring cash crop production so this

144
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:05,430
is going into corn silage profitability

145
00:06:01,978 --> 00:06:08,038
which is essentially the change in

146
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:10,699
silage yields from a cover crop

147
00:06:08,038 --> 00:06:13,228
treatment compared to the fallow control

148
00:06:10,699 --> 00:06:15,210
minus the cost of the cover crop seed so

149
00:06:13,228 --> 00:06:17,038
it's a partial it's a partial budgeting

150
00:06:15,209 --> 00:06:19,439
technique of looking at the

151
00:06:17,038 --> 00:06:21,329
profitability effect we're looking at

152
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:25,408
pest suppression so this is actually a

153
00:06:21,329 --> 00:06:28,978
meadow rhythm which is a soil soil

154
00:06:25,408 --> 00:06:33,360
fungus intimate pathogenic fungus that

155
00:06:28,978 --> 00:06:35,759
can infect the larvae of different pests

156
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:37,560
pest organisms looking at weed

157
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:39,149
suppression so we measured above-ground

158
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:41,360
weed biomass in the cover

159
00:06:39,149 --> 00:06:44,250
up stand in the fall and in the spring

160
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:46,740
and we're looking at changes in the soil

161
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:49,350
carbon and the data we're using in this

162
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:51,629
analysis is the act of carbon so this is

163
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:53,939
the potassium permanganate extractable

164
00:06:51,629 --> 00:06:56,579
carbon it's a fraction of the soil

165
00:06:53,939 --> 00:07:00,569
carbon that changes more rapidly when

166
00:06:56,579 --> 00:07:02,250
you have a management induced change so

167
00:07:00,569 --> 00:07:04,769
these are all the services that we

168
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:06,509
measured and since we're looking at

169
00:07:04,769 --> 00:07:09,930
multi-functionality what we actually did

170
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:11,579
is we averaged standardized values for

171
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:13,829
all of these services we averaged them

172
00:07:11,579 --> 00:07:17,310
together into what we're calling a multi

173
00:07:13,829 --> 00:07:20,689
functionality index so this figure shows

174
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:24,660
you that multi-functionality index

175
00:07:20,689 --> 00:07:27,750
across the cover crop species richness

176
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:30,750
and we have average values for each of

177
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:32,790
the treatments here but the main thing

178
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:34,579
main pattern I want to show you here is

179
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:37,439
that there's not a great relationship

180
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:39,300
between our cover crop species richness

181
00:07:37,439 --> 00:07:41,069
so the number of species of cover crops

182
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:42,210
that we have and the average

183
00:07:41,069 --> 00:07:46,189
multi-functionality

184
00:07:42,209 --> 00:07:49,979
right r-squared of 0.03 that's very low

185
00:07:46,189 --> 00:07:51,959
you know just you know the average of

186
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:53,189
the mixtures was actually a little bit

187
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:54,089
better than the average of the

188
00:07:53,189 --> 00:07:55,500
monocultures

189
00:07:54,089 --> 00:07:56,699
but you see quite a spread in the

190
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:59,579
monocultures actually the pea

191
00:07:56,699 --> 00:08:04,819
monoculture was more multifunctional on

192
00:07:59,579 --> 00:08:08,729
average than many of the mixes were so

193
00:08:04,819 --> 00:08:10,949
just cover crop species richness number

194
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:14,100
of species alone was a very poor

195
00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:16,110
predictor of this multi-functionality so

196
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:18,270
we wanted to look at other aspects of

197
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:20,970
diversity right so species richness

198
00:08:18,269 --> 00:08:22,500
isn't the only component of diversity

199
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:25,080
that might have an effect on multi

200
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:27,720
functionality and the direction that we

201
00:08:25,079 --> 00:08:31,109
went in was to look at functional

202
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:33,360
diversity and we found that there's a

203
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:36,690
metric of functional diversity called

204
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:39,029
relative raus quadratic entropy that as

205
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:41,790
we increased in that functional

206
00:08:39,029 --> 00:08:44,699
diversity metric our average

207
00:08:41,789 --> 00:08:47,159
multi-functionality increased so that's

208
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:50,060
good that was that actually kind of fits

209
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:52,230
the hypothesis of increasing diversity

210
00:08:50,059 --> 00:08:52,559
increases multi-functionality it just

211
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:55,320
didn't

212
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:57,689
to be species species diversity it's

213
00:08:55,320 --> 00:09:00,120
it's functional diversity so we also

214
00:08:57,690 --> 00:09:02,820
wanted to know why what was driving this

215
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:05,100
increase was it an increase in the

216
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:07,890
positive benefits that cover crops

217
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:10,040
provide or was it a decrease in some of

218
00:09:07,889 --> 00:09:12,778
the drawbacks so for example nitrogen

219
00:09:10,039 --> 00:09:13,349
immobilization or reducing cash crop

220
00:09:12,778 --> 00:09:15,720
yields

221
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:17,460
those can be drawbacks that those

222
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:20,790
negative aspects are actually averaged

223
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:23,430
into this mean value here so if we

224
00:09:20,789 --> 00:09:25,528
decompose these averaged values into the

225
00:09:23,429 --> 00:09:28,709
the positive services which are these

226
00:09:25,528 --> 00:09:31,230
black triangles and the negative dis

227
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:33,000
services which are the squares here what

228
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:35,039
we saw is that the services actually

229
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,690
didn't change so the benefits that we're

230
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:39,000
getting from cover crops the positive

231
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:41,279
benefits are staying the same as we

232
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,799
increase diversity but the drawbacks

233
00:09:41,278 --> 00:09:46,049
that cover crops can sometimes cause

234
00:09:43,799 --> 00:09:48,000
like nitrogen immobilization or

235
00:09:46,049 --> 00:09:51,389
something like that those drawbacks are

236
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:54,089
actually getting getting better we're

237
00:09:51,389 --> 00:09:56,009
ameliorating the dis services that cover

238
00:09:54,089 --> 00:09:58,500
crops can sometimes provide so this was

239
00:09:56,009 --> 00:10:01,139
an interesting finding that diversity

240
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:06,210
had this effect on ameliorating that dis

241
00:10:01,139 --> 00:10:08,250
services so I think there's some some

242
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:10,019
potential benefits to cover crop

243
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:12,330
mixtures but there's also some

244
00:10:10,019 --> 00:10:15,120
challenges so challenge number one

245
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:17,070
understanding functional diversity right

246
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:19,350
you can't call up your C company and say

247
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:21,839
hey give me the your seed mix with the

248
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:22,649
highest relative rouse quadratic entropy

249
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:24,930
right

250
00:10:22,649 --> 00:10:26,759
they'll probably hang up the phone and

251
00:10:24,929 --> 00:10:29,009
think you dialed the wrong number is

252
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:32,399
there anyone in this room they can even

253
00:10:29,009 --> 00:10:35,309
tell me what Rao's relative browsed

254
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:37,949
quadratic entropy is anyone come on be

255
00:10:35,309 --> 00:10:40,189
brave if you know okay so there's a lot

256
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:43,890
that we need to do to enhance our

257
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:45,920
literacy of functional diversity if this

258
00:10:43,889 --> 00:10:48,360
is if this is what's going to be driving

259
00:10:45,919 --> 00:10:49,708
improvements in cover crop mixtures we

260
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:51,600
need to understand what functional

261
00:10:49,708 --> 00:10:53,338
diversity is and how to manage that so I

262
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:56,190
want to give you a quick little primer

263
00:10:53,339 --> 00:10:58,529
here so functional diversity is all

264
00:10:56,190 --> 00:11:00,540
about the functional traits that the

265
00:10:58,528 --> 00:11:02,669
plant species have and these traits

266
00:11:00,539 --> 00:11:04,708
things like the fall growth rate the

267
00:11:02,669 --> 00:11:06,088
spring growth rate the carbon and

268
00:11:04,708 --> 00:11:08,638
nitrogen ratio these

269
00:11:06,089 --> 00:11:12,059
traits are what drive the provisioning

270
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:13,620
of these services and you can take these

271
00:11:12,058 --> 00:11:15,838
traits when you start thinking about

272
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:18,299
functional diversity you have to take

273
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:21,269
these traits and then you have to plot

274
00:11:18,299 --> 00:11:23,399
them in a multi-dimensional space okay

275
00:11:21,269 --> 00:11:25,049
so this is luckily here we only have

276
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:28,470
three traits that we used in our

277
00:11:25,049 --> 00:11:30,778
analysis so we can you know visualize it

278
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:32,309
in three dimensions but you can add as

279
00:11:30,778 --> 00:11:34,620
many traits as you want here and

280
00:11:32,308 --> 00:11:37,588
mathematically it kind of takes care of

281
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:39,480
this multi-dimensional space but it's

282
00:11:37,589 --> 00:11:41,100
you know it's nice to visualize it in

283
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:43,769
three dimensions so these are actually

284
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:45,509
our six species with their different

285
00:11:43,769 --> 00:11:49,078
trait values plotted in and

286
00:11:45,509 --> 00:11:50,909
multi-dimensional trait space here so

287
00:11:49,078 --> 00:11:55,438
then you can take the the six species

288
00:11:50,909 --> 00:11:57,208
and you can start connecting them so

289
00:11:55,438 --> 00:11:59,399
these are all our mixtures here so the

290
00:11:57,208 --> 00:11:59,909
three species and the P the RAI the red

291
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:03,720
clover

292
00:11:59,909 --> 00:12:09,299
if you connect these together you get

293
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:11,339
essentially a volume of space and you

294
00:12:09,299 --> 00:12:13,378
can look at the the center of the trait

295
00:12:11,339 --> 00:12:15,569
space so this is this black dot here

296
00:12:13,379 --> 00:12:18,028
that's the centroid you can look at the

297
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:20,099
distance that things are from the

298
00:12:18,028 --> 00:12:22,919
centroid and you can look at how evenly

299
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:27,409
the biomass is between all of the

300
00:12:22,919 --> 00:12:30,419
species and so those aspects evenness

301
00:12:27,409 --> 00:12:34,318
richness which is the the volume of the

302
00:12:30,419 --> 00:12:36,748
space divergence which is how far apart

303
00:12:34,318 --> 00:12:39,419
things are on average from the center

304
00:12:36,749 --> 00:12:41,939
these are components of functional

305
00:12:39,419 --> 00:12:44,219
diversity and we ran a number of

306
00:12:41,938 --> 00:12:46,620
different functional diversity metrics

307
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:48,329
that account for one or more of these

308
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:49,919
things you can combine these in

309
00:12:48,328 --> 00:12:51,928
different metrics to account for all

310
00:12:49,919 --> 00:12:55,019
three of them or just one or two of the

311
00:12:51,928 --> 00:12:57,749
three and relative rao's quadratic

312
00:12:55,019 --> 00:13:00,209
entropy was the one that was predictive

313
00:12:57,749 --> 00:13:02,909
of our multi functionality and this

314
00:13:00,208 --> 00:13:06,119
indicator takes into account evenness in

315
00:13:02,909 --> 00:13:07,649
divergence so what this is telling us is

316
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:11,188
what you want is you want to have

317
00:13:07,649 --> 00:13:13,139
species that are well spaced out from

318
00:13:11,188 --> 00:13:16,620
each other and you want to have even

319
00:13:13,139 --> 00:13:19,709
biomass across all of the species in

320
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:19,980
your mixture so this is actually if all

321
00:13:19,708 --> 00:13:21,659
of this

322
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:24,330
biomass was even this would be a fairly

323
00:13:21,659 --> 00:13:26,549
divergent mixture when we go to the four

324
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:28,770
species mix actually adding this canola

325
00:13:26,549 --> 00:13:31,049
in the middle here that reduces our

326
00:13:28,769 --> 00:13:33,179
divergence okay because we've put a

327
00:13:31,049 --> 00:13:35,370
species in there that has traits that

328
00:13:33,179 --> 00:13:37,859
are very close to the middle and we want

329
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:40,049
traits that are evenly spaced across the

330
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:41,850
edge so this is actually a case where

331
00:13:40,049 --> 00:13:43,799
adding a fourth species if you're

332
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:46,379
thinking about species diversity is as

333
00:13:43,799 --> 00:13:48,779
your indicator adding the fourth species

334
00:13:46,379 --> 00:13:51,090
actually reduced our functional

335
00:13:48,779 --> 00:13:53,009
diversity here so I think there's some

336
00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:54,780
traps that we could fall into when we

337
00:13:53,009 --> 00:13:56,700
don't understand functional diversity

338
00:13:54,779 --> 00:13:58,559
you might think oh let me add four or

339
00:13:56,700 --> 00:14:01,200
five six species well here's another

340
00:13:58,559 --> 00:14:03,919
good example of where having some

341
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:06,930
species in the middle of this volume

342
00:14:03,919 --> 00:14:08,549
reduces the divergence so I think

343
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:11,039
increasing our literacy around

344
00:14:08,549 --> 00:14:13,769
functional diversity will help us create

345
00:14:11,039 --> 00:14:14,399
better mixtures but higher performing

346
00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:16,919
mixtures

347
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:19,079
okay so challenge number two you now

348
00:14:16,919 --> 00:14:20,789
have to have evenness spread out around

349
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:23,310
the edges of your trait space which

350
00:14:20,789 --> 00:14:26,099
means you need to manage cover crop

351
00:14:23,309 --> 00:14:28,529
mixtures to be even in their biomass

352
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:33,269
production and this is a figure that

353
00:14:28,529 --> 00:14:35,339
shows biomass or essentially the

354
00:14:33,269 --> 00:14:39,000
composition of the cover crop stand over

355
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:41,340
time for the four different mixtures

356
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,139
here so we have the composition at

357
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:45,090
seeding so this is plants per meter

358
00:14:43,139 --> 00:14:47,220
squared we have the composition at

359
00:14:45,090 --> 00:14:50,009
germination so the number of plants that

360
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:51,990
germinated per meter squared our fall

361
00:14:50,009 --> 00:14:54,569
biomass composition and our spring

362
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:56,149
biomass composition for the the

363
00:14:54,570 --> 00:14:58,980
different mixtures and each of these

364
00:14:56,149 --> 00:15:01,259
shaded areas different colors represents

365
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:03,029
a different species in the mix and what

366
00:15:01,259 --> 00:15:07,139
we saw is that across all of the

367
00:15:03,029 --> 00:15:10,409
mixtures is in spring we had a strong

368
00:15:07,139 --> 00:15:13,250
convergence towards cereal rice cereal

369
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:17,939
rye really dominated a lot of our mixes

370
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:24,179
we lost red clover was really a minor

371
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:27,260
component you know so we really didn't

372
00:15:24,179 --> 00:15:30,870
achieve very even mixtures in in this

373
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:33,809
first stage of the experiment this is a

374
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:36,299
picture of the three species nitrogen

375
00:15:33,809 --> 00:15:40,319
here in spring the first year of the

376
00:15:36,299 --> 00:15:44,069
experiment so the cereal rye you see

377
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:46,440
very tall here red clover is you know

378
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:49,800
just hanging on down there a little bit

379
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:51,270
of Austrian winter pea so that was it

380
00:15:49,799 --> 00:15:52,740
that was a big challenge for evenness

381
00:15:51,269 --> 00:15:54,240
and we knew in the second phase of this

382
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:56,339
experiment we needed to do something

383
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:59,070
about the evenness so we switched up our

384
00:15:56,339 --> 00:16:01,260
species that we used in these mixes and

385
00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:04,620
in in the the second phase of the

386
00:16:01,259 --> 00:16:06,450
experiment we shifted RIE to triticale

387
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:09,269
and we shifted red clover to crimson

388
00:16:06,450 --> 00:16:11,310
clover so if you know anything about rye

389
00:16:09,269 --> 00:16:13,740
and red clover rye is the fastest

390
00:16:11,309 --> 00:16:15,809
growing of the grasses in the spring red

391
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:18,720
clover is the slowest growing of the

392
00:16:15,809 --> 00:16:20,849
legumes in the spring and so we set this

393
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:22,769
we basically set this mixture up for

394
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:24,778
failure because of the differences in

395
00:16:22,769 --> 00:16:27,360
spring growth rates so now we're going

396
00:16:24,778 --> 00:16:29,909
to a slower growing grass the triticale

397
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:31,889
and a faster growing clover the crimson

398
00:16:29,909 --> 00:16:37,139
clover and we're seeing much more even

399
00:16:31,889 --> 00:16:38,879
biomass in the stands another challenge

400
00:16:37,139 --> 00:16:40,559
for evenness is that the expression of

401
00:16:38,879 --> 00:16:44,070
these mixtures is very different across

402
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:46,529
different farm sites because of the soil

403
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:48,510
fertility and the climate at each site

404
00:16:46,529 --> 00:16:51,899
so this is the four species mixture

405
00:16:48,509 --> 00:16:55,889
planted four different locations these

406
00:16:51,899 --> 00:16:58,079
three were on farm locations and so this

407
00:16:55,889 --> 00:17:00,569
shows the the biomass composition in the

408
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:02,580
fall and you see depending on these

409
00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:04,740
different sites like this site was

410
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:06,838
almost all canola this was all kunal

411
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:10,019
most all canola but a good bit of pea

412
00:17:06,838 --> 00:17:11,938
here we had canola and rye here it was

413
00:17:10,019 --> 00:17:12,420
mostly rye a little bit of canola and

414
00:17:11,939 --> 00:17:14,819
pea

415
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:17,789
so the factors that we think are driving

416
00:17:14,818 --> 00:17:20,309
this are the temperate the climate and

417
00:17:17,789 --> 00:17:22,289
the nitrogen status so in the second

418
00:17:20,309 --> 00:17:25,698
phase of our work we've really focused

419
00:17:22,289 --> 00:17:29,178
on looking at gradients of climate and

420
00:17:25,699 --> 00:17:31,830
nitrogen status at seeding to be able to

421
00:17:29,179 --> 00:17:34,440
predict how the biomass might shift and

422
00:17:31,829 --> 00:17:36,480
try and adjust our seeding rates so a

423
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:40,259
postdoc on the project Barbara barabar

424
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:42,059
has a poster this evening looking at

425
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:44,039
some of this work where we're

426
00:17:42,059 --> 00:17:45,259
mechanistically changing planting dates

427
00:17:44,039 --> 00:17:47,089
and nitrogen fertility

428
00:17:45,259 --> 00:17:48,740
looking at differences in biomass

429
00:17:47,089 --> 00:17:54,619
composition so we'd welcome you to stop

430
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:56,480
by that okay when we think another

431
00:17:54,619 --> 00:17:59,479
challenge when we think about you know

432
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:01,130
doing a spider plot like this the just

433
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:03,740
that the layout of this spider plot

434
00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:06,080
implicitly implies that these services

435
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:08,359
are somewhat independent of each other

436
00:18:06,079 --> 00:18:11,990
and that it might actually be possible

437
00:18:08,359 --> 00:18:14,389
to have you know high service levels on

438
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:17,230
all of these around you know if you

439
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:19,820
theoretically have the optimal mixture

440
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:22,730
what we saw from the data in the first

441
00:18:19,819 --> 00:18:24,829
phase of this experiment this is a

442
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:26,750
principal components analysis with all

443
00:18:24,829 --> 00:18:28,460
of our services and this type of

444
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:32,058
analysis what it does is it allows you

445
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:34,759
to see what services are associated with

446
00:18:32,058 --> 00:18:36,379
each other which services are opposed

447
00:18:34,759 --> 00:18:38,750
with each other which services are

448
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:40,370
independent of each other and so the way

449
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:43,640
things shook out is we have these

450
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:45,979
bundles of services so nitrogen supply

451
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:48,020
cash crop production and profitability

452
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:51,110
were all related to each other so this

453
00:18:48,019 --> 00:18:53,150
is a service bundle here and a different

454
00:18:51,109 --> 00:18:55,459
bundle of services were actually opposed

455
00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:58,429
so there was a trade-off so nitrogen

456
00:18:55,460 --> 00:19:00,110
retention weed suppression and biomass

457
00:18:58,429 --> 00:19:02,390
production these were somewhat clustered

458
00:19:00,109 --> 00:19:03,889
together these are all opposed to each

459
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:06,980
other so there's a trade-off between

460
00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:08,690
these services soil carbon and pest

461
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:12,380
suppression seem to be relatively

462
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:15,710
independent so how do we how do we

463
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:17,270
manage this trade-off well in all of the

464
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:18,798
data that we have from on-farm

465
00:19:17,269 --> 00:19:20,869
experiments and research station

466
00:19:18,798 --> 00:19:22,849
experiments we were able to with the

467
00:19:20,869 --> 00:19:24,889
nitrogen trade-off at least start to

468
00:19:22,849 --> 00:19:28,279
understand what's driving this trade-off

469
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:30,410
so we have cover crop management factors

470
00:19:28,279 --> 00:19:32,210
that are affecting nitrogen supply and

471
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:35,779
nitrogen retention and there's also soil

472
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:38,900
management factors and for the cover

473
00:19:35,779 --> 00:19:40,970
crop management factors increasing the

474
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:43,070
non legumes seeding rate more having

475
00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:44,990
more grasses more brassicas that

476
00:19:43,069 --> 00:19:48,649
increase our nitrogen retention that

477
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:51,440
makes sense they're good scavengers for

478
00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:54,669
our nitrogen supply keeping a low

479
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:57,200
biomass c2n ratio in spring and fall

480
00:19:54,669 --> 00:19:58,559
that increase our nitrogen supplies so

481
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,659
increasing these the

482
00:19:58,558 --> 00:20:02,970
Crees nitrogen supply having more

483
00:20:00,659 --> 00:20:05,159
nitrogen in the biomass in the spring

484
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:07,350
increased nitrogen supply and the

485
00:20:05,159 --> 00:20:09,320
trade-off between these two services is

486
00:20:07,349 --> 00:20:11,609
actually this indirect effect we're

487
00:20:09,319 --> 00:20:14,428
increasing the non legging seeding rate

488
00:20:11,609 --> 00:20:18,959
increased the c2n ratio which decreased

489
00:20:14,429 --> 00:20:22,919
the nitrogen supply so the if we look at

490
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:24,659
our soil management factors here we see

491
00:20:22,919 --> 00:20:27,570
that increasing the fall soil nitrogen

492
00:20:24,659 --> 00:20:29,519
so farms that applied manure in the fall

493
00:20:27,569 --> 00:20:32,428
had a high nitrate level in the fall

494
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:34,649
they had a highly Qing load when we had

495
00:20:32,429 --> 00:20:37,528
that high level of nitrate in the soil

496
00:20:34,648 --> 00:20:38,969
we needed more of a non legume seeding

497
00:20:37,528 --> 00:20:41,730
rate to combat the nitrogen retention

498
00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:44,249
which hurt our nitrogen supply factor

499
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:46,829
here so if we can manage our fall soil

500
00:20:44,249 --> 00:20:48,360
nitrogen to have low soil nitrogen in

501
00:20:46,829 --> 00:20:51,298
the fall so avoid fall manure

502
00:20:48,359 --> 00:20:52,288
applications avoid excessive tillage and

503
00:20:51,298 --> 00:20:55,048
the fall which can stimulate

504
00:20:52,288 --> 00:20:57,058
mineralization we could get away with

505
00:20:55,048 --> 00:21:01,048
the lower non legging seeding rate which

506
00:20:57,058 --> 00:21:03,058
would help maintain high nitrogen supply

507
00:21:01,048 --> 00:21:05,190
the other thing we saw is that sites

508
00:21:03,058 --> 00:21:07,109
that had high soil carbon levels or high

509
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:09,179
soil organic matter levels there's

510
00:21:07,109 --> 00:21:11,459
nitrogen coupled with that carbon and

511
00:21:09,179 --> 00:21:13,769
that increased our nitrogen supply so

512
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:16,200
building high soil organic matter levels

513
00:21:13,769 --> 00:21:18,179
can help offset some of the negative

514
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:20,730
aspects of higher nam legumes seeding

515
00:21:18,179 --> 00:21:22,919
rates the other great indirect effect of

516
00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:25,860
increased soil carbon that we saw is

517
00:21:22,919 --> 00:21:27,778
that it helped to maintain lower c2n

518
00:21:25,859 --> 00:21:30,298
ratios in our cover crop tissue in the

519
00:21:27,778 --> 00:21:31,798
fall in the spring because there's more

520
00:21:30,298 --> 00:21:35,429
nitrogen available in the soil from

521
00:21:31,798 --> 00:21:36,720
mineralization and whatnot so all of

522
00:21:35,429 --> 00:21:38,700
these effects interacting with each

523
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:43,079
other are kind of difficult to keep

524
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:45,330
track of so we developed a little online

525
00:21:43,079 --> 00:21:46,798
calculator that takes all this

526
00:21:45,329 --> 00:21:48,658
information it gives you a little

527
00:21:46,798 --> 00:21:51,028
graphical output and helps you make a

528
00:21:48,659 --> 00:21:53,840
decision about what type of nan legging

529
00:21:51,028 --> 00:21:56,190
seeding rate to use what type of

530
00:21:53,839 --> 00:21:58,678
nitrogen supply you'll get for your next

531
00:21:56,190 --> 00:22:00,450
corn crop and this is described in a

532
00:21:58,679 --> 00:22:03,360
paper that we have publishing actually

533
00:22:00,450 --> 00:22:05,429
download just the HTML file everything

534
00:22:03,359 --> 00:22:07,788
is embedded in that single file can

535
00:22:05,429 --> 00:22:09,629
download that and and use the calculator

536
00:22:07,788 --> 00:22:11,019
and we're working on getting some

537
00:22:09,628 --> 00:22:13,419
tutorial videos

538
00:22:11,019 --> 00:22:15,519
post it on on how to do that but it's an

539
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:17,050
attachment to this paper a supplement to

540
00:22:15,519 --> 00:22:19,269
this paper you can download it now or

541
00:22:17,049 --> 00:22:21,039
you can contact me for the file if

542
00:22:19,269 --> 00:22:22,660
you're interested so conclusions

543
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:25,750
mixtures can increase multi

544
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:28,090
functionality but it requires intensive

545
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:29,650
management so functional diversity was

546
00:22:28,089 --> 00:22:32,470
more important than species diversity

547
00:22:29,650 --> 00:22:34,060
and our data shows that you should

548
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:37,059
target functional evenness and

549
00:22:34,059 --> 00:22:39,309
divergence biomass evenness is a

550
00:22:37,059 --> 00:22:41,049
challenge to achieve so you need to

551
00:22:39,309 --> 00:22:43,419
select species with compatible growth

552
00:22:41,049 --> 00:22:45,369
rates and adjust your seeding rates to

553
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:47,950
the climate and so on that nitrogen

554
00:22:45,369 --> 00:22:49,869
status of your site and then services

555
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:52,750
are bundled and have trade-offs so to

556
00:22:49,869 --> 00:22:54,369
minimize that nitrogen supply and

557
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:56,380
retention trade-off it's actually about

558
00:22:54,369 --> 00:22:59,339
how you manage your soils so that was

559
00:22:56,380 --> 00:23:03,450
kind of an interesting outcome from that

560
00:22:59,339 --> 00:23:07,899
so I think that's all thank you I have

561
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:11,700
time for questions or okay a question or

562
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:11,700
two yes ma'am

563
00:23:15,829 --> 00:23:19,309
after all

564
00:23:25,890 --> 00:23:32,770
so that really varied depending on the

565
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:36,280
year and depending on the site so so

566
00:23:32,769 --> 00:23:39,519
yeah that varied we took that we took

567
00:23:36,279 --> 00:23:40,839
that into account by the c2n ratio so

568
00:23:39,519 --> 00:23:45,039
that's essentially going to be a moving

569
00:23:40,839 --> 00:23:47,079
target and in this calculator here we

570
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:48,639
actually have there's variables for your

571
00:23:47,079 --> 00:23:50,740
spring growing degree days and your fall

572
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:52,809
growing degree days and those actually

573
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:55,240
shift the C to end ratio behind the

574
00:23:52,808 --> 00:23:58,529
scenes in the model and so that can help

575
00:23:55,240 --> 00:24:01,529
you account for some of that as well

576
00:23:58,529 --> 00:24:01,529
yes

577
00:24:13,109 --> 00:24:18,668
hmmm I think that there's still

578
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:20,829
something to the insurance effect of

579
00:24:18,669 --> 00:24:22,990
having because yeah they may not Mike

580
00:24:20,829 --> 00:24:25,028
some species might do better or worse I

581
00:24:22,990 --> 00:24:29,859
guess I wonder if they really do have

582
00:24:25,028 --> 00:24:31,599
the same functional traits are they

583
00:24:29,859 --> 00:24:33,599
really are they going to be impacted

584
00:24:31,599 --> 00:24:36,969
negatively by the same environmental

585
00:24:33,599 --> 00:24:38,128
extremes that might happen I guess I

586
00:24:36,970 --> 00:24:41,288
think in terms of the insurance

587
00:24:38,128 --> 00:24:42,638
hypothesis I would say if you're

588
00:24:41,288 --> 00:24:46,148
thinking about your traits around the

589
00:24:42,638 --> 00:24:49,298
edge try and populate more traits around

590
00:24:46,148 --> 00:24:52,599
the edge so that if you lose a few your

591
00:24:49,298 --> 00:24:54,368
you still have others around the edges I

592
00:24:52,599 --> 00:24:57,849
wouldn't necessarily try and pile up

593
00:24:54,368 --> 00:25:03,868
multiple species on three points of a

594
00:24:57,849 --> 00:25:03,868
triangle does that make sense yep yes

595
00:25:11,808 --> 00:25:18,660
yeah so I think all of the seed

596
00:25:16,349 --> 00:25:22,139
companies are good and they know their

597
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:25,019
products better than anyone else does

598
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:27,540
and I think that as a community we're

599
00:25:25,019 --> 00:25:29,308
all learning together and I guess what I

600
00:25:27,539 --> 00:25:33,178
would hope is that some of this

601
00:25:29,308 --> 00:25:36,149
information can ultimately get you know

602
00:25:33,179 --> 00:25:38,040
integrated into how companies are making

603
00:25:36,150 --> 00:25:40,320
their mixes I think the challenge though

604
00:25:38,039 --> 00:25:42,659
is that what we're seeing is that the

605
00:25:40,319 --> 00:25:44,789
same ratio of seeding rates may not be

606
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:45,870
appropriate for every farm I think

607
00:25:44,789 --> 00:25:48,539
that's going to be a challenge for the

608
00:25:45,869 --> 00:25:50,699
seed companies because they need to mix

609
00:25:48,539 --> 00:25:53,990
their seed and bulk to some extent and

610
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:57,150
have a consistent lineup and so I think

611
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:59,370
some of the farm tuning may have to

612
00:25:57,150 --> 00:26:01,500
occur at the farm level the farmer may

613
00:25:59,369 --> 00:26:03,989
have to say okay I'm going to procure

614
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:06,720
this stream of seed and then I'm going

615
00:26:03,990 --> 00:26:08,429
to decide what my mixing ratio is going

616
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,870
to be so but so that adds a little bit

617
00:26:08,429 --> 00:26:13,080
of extra management challenge to the

618
00:26:09,869 --> 00:26:22,139
farmer alright well I probably used up

619
00:26:13,079 --> 00:26:24,210
my time so all right thank you this has

620
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:29,960
been a production of Cornell University
