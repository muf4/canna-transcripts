00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,280
this is a production of Cornell

00:00:01,679 --> 00:00:04,280
University

3
00:00:08,939 --> 00:00:13,388
today I would like to talk to you about

4
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:16,109
exploitation of complex structure of

5
00:00:13,388 --> 00:00:19,660
genotype by environment interaction in

6
00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:23,289
cassava roots crop using IIT cassava

7
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:25,929
breeding program as the key study so

8
00:00:23,289 --> 00:00:29,019
multi environment has allowed Britta to

9
00:00:25,928 --> 00:00:32,378
scream for genotypic reaction to a range

10
00:00:29,018 --> 00:00:34,329
of parameter condition if the nominal

11
00:00:32,378 --> 00:00:38,079
people refer to as the denoted by

12
00:00:34,329 --> 00:00:41,109
environment interaction this kind of

13
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:44,609
tree is usually converted at uniformly

14
00:00:41,109 --> 00:00:48,549
track at the late stage of evolution

15
00:00:44,609 --> 00:00:50,469
crowd to release all varieties a number

16
00:00:48,549 --> 00:00:53,858
of ways such as crude method have been

17
00:00:50,469 --> 00:00:56,739
proposed for exporting to notable

18
00:00:53,859 --> 00:00:59,160
environment interactions so among them

19
00:00:56,738 --> 00:01:02,018
are leaner by linear models such as

20
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:04,920
additive media freedoms multiplicative

21
00:01:02,018 --> 00:01:08,590
interaction Moodle site accretion Moodle

22
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:13,450
sub to analytic model and multivariate

23
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:15,939
multivariate model so deep in principle

24
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:19,599
objectives of these studies to assess

25
00:01:15,939 --> 00:01:22,299
complex root of G by heat interaction by

26
00:01:19,599 --> 00:01:25,569
identifying optimum model with FIFA

27
00:01:22,299 --> 00:01:27,939
grass cover structures so we also

28
00:01:25,569 --> 00:01:30,399
interested in estimating genetic merit

29
00:01:27,939 --> 00:01:34,868
of individual genotype toward

30
00:01:30,399 --> 00:01:39,280
identification of speaker in no time so

31
00:01:34,868 --> 00:01:41,349
to achieve these objectives so we tried

32
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:44,349
to put together a total number of 30

33
00:01:41,349 --> 00:01:47,799
trials across nine locations until

34
00:01:44,349 --> 00:01:50,319
increasing so those railway established

35
00:01:47,799 --> 00:01:53,170
as a randomized complete block design

36
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:55,000
interior crickets so in total we have

37
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:58,989
the total number of world resistant

38
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:01,929
genotypes permitted across 30 trials so

39
00:01:58,989 --> 00:02:04,899
in this study we intend to make use of

40
00:02:01,929 --> 00:02:08,830
ours as an instrument for the analysis

41
00:02:04,899 --> 00:02:12,159
so as you can see from this table these

42
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:14,319
two the number of trials for individual

43
00:02:12,159 --> 00:02:19,959
environments and a political incision

44
00:02:14,318 --> 00:02:21,639
you considered the data as if it a kind

45
00:02:19,959 --> 00:02:23,830
of unbalanced structure

46
00:02:21,639 --> 00:02:25,899
four defined as the number of traveling

47
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:28,510
from one location to the other

48
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:30,760
and for one who sees into the other so

49
00:02:28,509 --> 00:02:33,939
to start with we try to come up with

50
00:02:30,759 --> 00:02:37,000
this concrete measures to have idea of

51
00:02:33,939 --> 00:02:40,210
the number of genotypes that is common

52
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:43,389
to any pair of environment so the key

53
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:45,879
message is that those environment that

54
00:02:43,389 --> 00:02:48,359
have higher number of genotype can cover

55
00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:51,159
so there is a likelihood of sharing

56
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:53,890
common information than those

57
00:02:51,159 --> 00:02:56,219
environment that have less genotype in

58
00:02:53,889 --> 00:02:56,219
coma

59
00:02:56,530 --> 00:03:03,409
so after that we went ahead to a fight

60
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:05,870
of the distribution of the roots heat

61
00:03:03,409 --> 00:03:09,159
which is our key trait of interest so

62
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:13,939
the key message from this board is that

63
00:03:09,159 --> 00:03:15,799
deiayed seem to exhibit a Gaussian

64
00:03:13,939 --> 00:03:18,729
distribution from one environment to the

65
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:21,189
other as you can see that the mean is

66
00:03:18,729 --> 00:03:24,079
approximately equal to the median

67
00:03:21,189 --> 00:03:27,560
another key message from this plot is

68
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:31,880
that there is a community of genetic

69
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:35,390
variance across the environment Mini

70
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:38,900
does this soil suggest the presence of

71
00:03:35,389 --> 00:03:40,519
Ginetta by environment interaction so as

72
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:42,980
we all know that in a multi-level

73
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:45,469
maitreya the same trait measured in

74
00:03:42,979 --> 00:03:49,250
different environment can be considered

75
00:03:45,469 --> 00:03:54,500
to be different rates so we tried to

76
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:57,110
look at Pearson correlations among good

77
00:03:54,500 --> 00:04:00,129
environment as you considered there are

78
00:03:57,110 --> 00:04:03,920
some number of environments where the

79
00:04:00,129 --> 00:04:06,979
condition is very hard I'm positive

80
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:10,009
so that means there is less of G by E or

81
00:04:06,979 --> 00:04:12,709
mu G by induced kind of environments

82
00:04:10,009 --> 00:04:16,009
there are some with positive correlation

83
00:04:12,709 --> 00:04:18,228
that are very low so mineral there's

84
00:04:16,009 --> 00:04:19,728
likely to be G by E industrial

85
00:04:18,228 --> 00:04:21,889
government so we still have some

86
00:04:19,728 --> 00:04:24,668
environment that are very cost

87
00:04:21,889 --> 00:04:29,000
contrasting in the sense that the the

88
00:04:24,668 --> 00:04:31,699
correlation is perfect and negative so

89
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:35,779
which suggests that there is likely to

90
00:04:31,699 --> 00:04:40,759
be presence of G by he high G by G so

91
00:04:35,779 --> 00:04:42,918
that is visual approach of assessing the

92
00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:46,569
presence of G by or not so we we have

93
00:04:42,918 --> 00:04:49,849
ahead to assess the process of debate

94
00:04:46,569 --> 00:04:52,569
numerically so and here we are trying to

95
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:55,760
test a policies that there is no G by E

96
00:04:52,569 --> 00:04:58,519
against all alternative possesses a

97
00:04:55,759 --> 00:05:01,939
possesses that there is G by E mineral

98
00:04:58,519 --> 00:05:05,209
the velocity by is greater than 0 so we

99
00:05:01,939 --> 00:05:07,969
fit this nested body for the null

100
00:05:05,209 --> 00:05:09,469
hypothesis without inclusion of Ginetta

101
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:12,140
by environment

102
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:15,050
so this same model is the parameterize

103
00:05:12,139 --> 00:05:18,319
by inclusion of Ginetta by environment

104
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:20,480
interaction and this is the result we

105
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:23,959
got from the nested border and you

106
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:25,879
consider the variance component

107
00:05:23,959 --> 00:05:28,129
estimated for each of this defect here

108
00:05:25,879 --> 00:05:31,069
we have the similar trait for the food

109
00:05:28,129 --> 00:05:35,899
model so I decide the queerest component

110
00:05:31,069 --> 00:05:37,759
attributed to each of this factor so in

111
00:05:35,899 --> 00:05:40,789
order to see whether the inclusion of G

112
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:43,480
by E is significant or not

113
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:47,480
so we have to cut out likelihood ripest

114
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:49,730
ratio test and by Becca different

115
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:54,080
between log likelihood of nester body

116
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:57,439
are full models who wish approximate

117
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:59,359
cast chi-square distribution with degree

118
00:05:57,439 --> 00:06:01,910
of freedom equal to the difference in

119
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:05,180
the number of the parameter estimated so

120
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:08,620
I wish seem to be significant so which

121
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:11,030
tell us that the inclusion of G by E

122
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:14,540
makes sense and that cannot be ignored

123
00:06:11,029 --> 00:06:16,879
as you can see here from this model you

124
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:21,170
consider the various attributed to G by

125
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:25,399
E is more than twice that of genetic

126
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:28,220
effect which means that G by is the

127
00:06:25,399 --> 00:06:31,219
genetic bearers is specifically

128
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:35,090
environment and it's very large and G by

129
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:39,530
E is very important cannot be ignored in

130
00:06:35,089 --> 00:06:42,289
this study so we went ahead to see if we

131
00:06:39,529 --> 00:06:44,419
should assume that the arabela's is

132
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:48,410
similar across all those data

133
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:50,990
environment or ad add a heterogeneous so

134
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:53,090
we went ahead by fitting the full model

135
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:56,000
this time around we assumed that

136
00:06:53,089 --> 00:06:59,449
arabela's diskette originals in each of

137
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:02,600
those environments and we fit the nested

138
00:06:59,449 --> 00:07:05,209
model which assumed that the residual

139
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:07,879
Beres is uniform across all the 30

140
00:07:05,209 --> 00:07:10,489
environments so this is restoring gated

141
00:07:07,879 --> 00:07:12,769
by fitting the full model as you can see

142
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:16,750
the arrow balance range from two point

143
00:07:12,769 --> 00:07:19,370
four two to ninety nine point six six

144
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:22,759
and for the nested border which

145
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:24,769
estimates which I assume what you know

146
00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:26,930
from Arab urine samples or the

147
00:07:24,769 --> 00:07:29,479
environment he was this result

148
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:32,629
so as usual we carry out the likelihood

149
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:34,629
ratio test which confirmed that as some

150
00:07:32,629 --> 00:07:39,800
sort of error

151
00:07:34,629 --> 00:07:42,019
Vera's eternity make sense and it has to

152
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:44,389
be taken to Constitution so that the

153
00:07:42,019 --> 00:07:47,000
resort for the analysis will not mislead

154
00:07:44,389 --> 00:07:49,339
us so in the next couple of slides I'll

155
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:53,149
talk about different kind of mirrors for

156
00:07:49,339 --> 00:07:55,609
various structures we had we feed in the

157
00:07:53,149 --> 00:07:58,329
course of trying to explore the complex

158
00:07:55,610 --> 00:08:01,009
Russell of G ba he we started by fitting

159
00:07:58,329 --> 00:08:03,589
compound symmetry model which is the

160
00:08:01,009 --> 00:08:06,019
most restrictive of all the models so

161
00:08:03,589 --> 00:08:09,619
this kind of model assume that the

162
00:08:06,019 --> 00:08:13,159
genetic virus within the environment is

163
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:14,769
uniform and the qu the covariance or

164
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:19,480
correlation between any pair of

165
00:08:14,769 --> 00:08:22,819
environment is also uniform so this

166
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:27,520
model may not be realistic will bad what

167
00:08:22,819 --> 00:08:30,829
we saw in the in the previous slide that

168
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:34,029
the error variance etcetera he knows the

169
00:08:30,829 --> 00:08:37,429
genetic virus within the parameters is

170
00:08:34,029 --> 00:08:41,059
heterogeneous as well so this is

171
00:08:37,429 --> 00:08:43,339
extracts from the model we fitted so if

172
00:08:41,059 --> 00:08:45,979
touched by 30 matrices but there's no

173
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:47,990
way we can visualize everything at once

174
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:50,750
as you can see I know you crucified

175
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:53,240
Algona those are the degenerative URIs

176
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:55,549
readily apparent which are uniform of

177
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:58,370
the diagonal that is the correlation

178
00:08:55,549 --> 00:09:00,949
between any pair of environment so we

179
00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:03,769
went ahead to fit compare symmetry at

180
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:08,600
Regina's model which is just extension

181
00:09:03,769 --> 00:09:10,519
of the previous model so here the

182
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:12,980
correlation between any pair of an

183
00:09:10,519 --> 00:09:14,480
environment is uniform and what makes it

184
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:17,930
different from the previous model is

185
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:21,320
that the genetic variance across the

186
00:09:17,929 --> 00:09:24,829
environment is heterogeneous and this is

187
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:26,300
the result obtained from that model as

188
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:28,910
you can see another piece about the

189
00:09:26,299 --> 00:09:30,859
Iguana these are the genetic variance

190
00:09:28,909 --> 00:09:33,649
estimated in each of their government

191
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:35,949
which is unique based of the double is

192
00:09:33,649 --> 00:09:38,649
the coronation

193
00:09:35,948 --> 00:09:41,318
pema's coordination between environment

194
00:09:38,649 --> 00:09:43,509
which is uniform so this is another form

195
00:09:41,318 --> 00:09:46,479
of modeling we fitted and this is the

196
00:09:43,509 --> 00:09:50,230
most liberal of adi model it is liberal

197
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:52,808
in the sense that it's fitful g'bye

198
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:55,480
without structures so in this kind of

199
00:09:52,808 --> 00:09:58,108
model we assume that each environment

200
00:09:55,480 --> 00:10:01,109
has unique genetic variance and

201
00:09:58,109 --> 00:10:05,350
correlation between any pair of

202
00:10:01,109 --> 00:10:07,649
environment is also unique so fitted

203
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:11,139
this kind of model you have to estimate

204
00:10:07,649 --> 00:10:12,759
what enlighten umber of parameters take

205
00:10:11,139 --> 00:10:15,579
the sample which started number of

206
00:10:12,759 --> 00:10:18,850
trials in our story so that means we are

207
00:10:15,578 --> 00:10:21,608
going to estimate around 465 parameters

208
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:24,999
so we try to fit it and is the error

209
00:10:21,609 --> 00:10:28,269
message we got so this means it is not

210
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:30,839
only computational inefficient to fit

211
00:10:28,269 --> 00:10:36,089
this kind of model that also

212
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:39,100
computational prohibitive so we fitted

213
00:10:36,089 --> 00:10:42,279
factor analytic model as well factor

214
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:44,649
analytic model in smoky boards just miss

215
00:10:42,278 --> 00:10:47,308
model and a lot of army which is

216
00:10:44,649 --> 00:10:50,619
additive may be feted multiplicative

217
00:10:47,308 --> 00:10:53,438
international model so this is a model

218
00:10:50,619 --> 00:10:56,949
that is a kind of lower order across

219
00:10:53,438 --> 00:10:58,988
measure two on structural models so

220
00:10:56,948 --> 00:11:02,068
which factor analytic model you can

221
00:10:58,989 --> 00:11:07,389
identify related common factor that

222
00:11:02,068 --> 00:11:10,208
capture understand the G by E pattern so

223
00:11:07,389 --> 00:11:12,369
as you can see this is our structures on

224
00:11:10,208 --> 00:11:17,649
the photo analytical models looks like

225
00:11:12,369 --> 00:11:19,418
and this components Phi is specific

226
00:11:17,649 --> 00:11:23,308
errors in nature of the environment and

227
00:11:19,418 --> 00:11:23,308
this square of loadings

228
00:11:23,879 --> 00:11:29,970
plus this specific bearers who give you

229
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:32,829
the generating Vere's in each of the

230
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:35,379
environments I'm using this to

231
00:11:32,828 --> 00:11:38,198
illustrate when you feed button and

232
00:11:35,379 --> 00:11:40,329
unfit model of Ottawa and of the

233
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:43,719
diagonal is the genetic covariance

234
00:11:40,328 --> 00:11:46,238
between any pair of environment and is

235
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:49,220
just a matter of dividing this genetic

236
00:11:46,239 --> 00:11:51,769
virus by the square root of the

237
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:53,540
of these areas and these barrels if you

238
00:11:51,769 --> 00:11:54,889
interested in knowing the genetic

239
00:11:53,539 --> 00:11:58,578
correlation between any pair of

240
00:11:54,889 --> 00:12:03,399
environments so after fitting all this

241
00:11:58,578 --> 00:12:06,469
sort of models so we we try to use a

242
00:12:03,399 --> 00:12:10,580
goodness of fit statistic to be able to

243
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:13,410
identify the best mother duck

244
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:15,720
asking the contest papa and G by E as

245
00:12:13,409 --> 00:12:20,669
you can see from attacking information

246
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:23,879
criterion so that was that in fact Oh

247
00:12:20,669 --> 00:12:27,149
analytic model of a tattoo is the most

248
00:12:23,879 --> 00:12:31,379
parsimonious model explaining the

249
00:12:27,149 --> 00:12:35,970
complex strategy by which 114 parameters

250
00:12:31,379 --> 00:12:39,828
and by looking at di see it identified

251
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:42,570
compound symmetry as the best model a

252
00:12:39,828 --> 00:12:46,019
lot of people prefer to use attack

253
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:49,560
information criteria simply because the

254
00:12:46,019 --> 00:12:53,669
di C imposes ended penalty on the

255
00:12:49,559 --> 00:12:56,028
complex model by identifying a simpler

256
00:12:53,669 --> 00:12:59,399
model so we go for akaike information

257
00:12:56,028 --> 00:13:01,889
criterion so after identify factor

258
00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:04,019
analytic model offer that to what animal

259
00:13:01,889 --> 00:13:07,919
would other tree's are you have to

260
00:13:04,019 --> 00:13:11,278
multiplied but applicative component so

261
00:13:07,919 --> 00:13:14,099
and this is the result we obtain from

262
00:13:11,278 --> 00:13:15,929
facto analytic model for that - so the

263
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:19,370
first two column here that is what he

264
00:13:15,929 --> 00:13:22,139
called deleted common factors which

265
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:26,549
explain the complex pattern of G by E

266
00:13:22,139 --> 00:13:29,458
and this column here that is what you

267
00:13:26,549 --> 00:13:32,219
call spacing informal specific variants

268
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:35,669
in other what this de Vere's in nature

269
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:39,420
of this environment that is not captured

270
00:13:35,669 --> 00:13:41,039
by this latent common factors so what

271
00:13:39,419 --> 00:13:44,069
would he about this factor analytic

272
00:13:41,039 --> 00:13:45,449
model is that when you have information

273
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:48,360
about amber meta

274
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:50,640
variables like precipitation the

275
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:52,528
temperatures so you can decide to look

276
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:57,000
at correlation of course environmental

277
00:13:52,528 --> 00:13:59,578
variables with this lated common factor

278
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,828
to be able to identify which of the

279
00:13:59,578 --> 00:14:05,899
environment upon variable is very

280
00:14:01,828 --> 00:14:09,929
relevant in explaining G by E

281
00:14:05,899 --> 00:14:13,440
interaction so from this photo analytic

282
00:14:09,929 --> 00:14:15,599
model from this littered photos so when

283
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:18,149
you take the square of these and this

284
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:20,629
Plus this one that will give you the

285
00:14:18,149 --> 00:14:24,139
genetic variance in

286
00:14:20,629 --> 00:14:28,429
which of these environments so the key

287
00:14:24,139 --> 00:14:31,699
message is that our photo analytic model

288
00:14:28,429 --> 00:14:36,319
of either to capture a total of 60

289
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:39,670
points 90% of the variations where the

290
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:41,990
first component and separ component

291
00:14:39,669 --> 00:14:47,269
accounted for forty two point one and

292
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:48,950
18.8% or the finish respectively so the

293
00:14:47,269 --> 00:14:51,169
lesson learned and take-home message

294
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:55,790
from this study is that the cop

295
00:14:51,169 --> 00:14:58,370
asymmetry murder fits is simply D by a

296
00:14:55,789 --> 00:15:02,289
structures they are very easy to fit and

297
00:14:58,370 --> 00:15:05,000
comfort easily they are recommended if

298
00:15:02,289 --> 00:15:07,819
it'll fit in confident confidence trust

299
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:10,190
cannot be found even though they do not

300
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:13,360
provide better understanding of G by a

301
00:15:10,190 --> 00:15:15,620
structures construction model is

302
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:17,810
computationally demanding as the number

303
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:21,399
of environments or try keep increasing

304
00:15:17,809 --> 00:15:24,229
so in analysis of mud environment rafts

305
00:15:21,399 --> 00:15:27,679
it is very rare for people to use this

306
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:30,259
model because you may you may you may

307
00:15:27,679 --> 00:15:33,259
end up having a solution that is not

308
00:15:30,259 --> 00:15:35,899
contract factor analytic model is very

309
00:15:33,259 --> 00:15:38,960
parsimonious and an effective approach

310
00:15:35,899 --> 00:15:41,590
for dissected G by E in this stage of

311
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:45,740
where you have a large number of trials

312
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:48,500
so the next step is to see how we can

313
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:50,240
identify a subset of environment with

314
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:53,570
and without crossover in these studies

315
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:56,990
and we also plan to incorporate still

316
00:15:53,570 --> 00:15:59,360
make metadata into the model to see how

317
00:15:56,990 --> 00:16:03,500
we can capture the relationship among

318
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:07,009
those genotypes so at this your son I

319
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:09,889
like to test the Gates Foundation UK

320

head for the financial support my

321
00:16:09,889 --> 00:16:15,019
appreciation also put my committee

324
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:26,289
lab and our collaborators as well I

325
00:16:22,269 --> 00:16:28,829
thank everyone for give me attention

326
00:16:26,289 --> 00:16:32,269
thank you

327
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:32,270
okay thank you very much but it
