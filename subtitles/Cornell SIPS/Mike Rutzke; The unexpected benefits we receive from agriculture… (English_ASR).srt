1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:04,219
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,189 --> 00:00:04,220
University

3
00:00:08,359 --> 00:00:17,939
so if everybody hear me okay good so one

4
00:00:12,689 --> 00:00:20,309
thing I learned about having goats they

5
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:22,289
give you plenty of opportunity to talk

6
00:00:20,309 --> 00:00:29,879
about things to talk about in a seminar

7
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:32,820
that's entertaining so so I'm going to

8
00:00:29,879 --> 00:00:36,030
talk to you a little bit about the

9
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:38,640
personal and societal perspectives of

10
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:40,289
Agriculture it's not just about growing

11
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,759
food everybody here is familiar with

12
00:00:40,289 --> 00:00:43,049
growing food so I want to talk to you

13
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:45,269
about some of my personal experiences

14
00:00:43,049 --> 00:00:48,229
our family's personal experiences on the

15
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:50,670
farm I'm gonna talk a little about the

16
00:00:48,229 --> 00:00:53,669
historical parts how other cultures

17
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:55,649
treat agriculture and natural resources

18
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:57,989
our family a little bit on nutrition and

19
00:00:55,649 --> 00:01:00,030
I'm going to close off with the effects

20
00:00:57,988 --> 00:01:04,198
that I felt from climate change on our

21
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:06,030
farm and some of the spectroscopy areas

22
00:01:04,198 --> 00:01:09,349
that we need to consider for for

23
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:09,349
adaptation practices

24
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:22,250
okay now how do I start no I need just

25
00:01:17,899 --> 00:01:27,379
there's a there's a video imagine the

26
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:30,349
earth as an athlete if it were sliced

27
00:01:27,379 --> 00:01:36,048
into four pieces three pieces would

28
00:01:30,349 --> 00:01:38,899
represent the Earth's if the remaining

29
00:01:36,049 --> 00:01:41,329
piece was sliced in half again one piece

30
00:01:38,899 --> 00:01:44,659
would represent the land on earth that

31
00:01:41,328 --> 00:01:46,818
is unsuitable or inhospitable for farm

32
00:01:44,659 --> 00:01:50,439
this leaves one-eighth the people

33
00:01:46,819 --> 00:01:52,640
representing land grow food

34
00:01:50,438 --> 00:01:55,609
three-quarters of the remaining apple

35
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:58,579
slice would represent soils too poor to

36
00:01:55,609 --> 00:02:03,289
produce food or land covered by cities

37
00:01:58,578 --> 00:02:05,568
roads and buildings remaining piece 1/32

38
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:08,899
of the Apple represents the portion of

39
00:02:05,569 --> 00:02:11,840
the earth where food this is our

40
00:02:08,899 --> 00:02:14,479
farmland the thin peel of this slice

41
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:20,509
represents the farmlands layer of

42
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:24,259
topsoil where the United States this is

43
00:02:20,509 --> 00:02:26,929
about an acre of farm over 70% of

44
00:02:24,259 --> 00:02:29,419
america's fruit vegetables and dairy

45
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:31,760
products are produced on farms near

46
00:02:29,419 --> 00:02:34,219
cities that lie directly in the path of

47
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:36,620
sprawling development sustainable

48
00:02:34,219 --> 00:02:38,959
practices and careful planning such as

49
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:41,450
farmland conservation are needed to

50
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:59,959
protect this precious resource for today

51
00:02:41,449 --> 00:03:05,209
and for the future okay so these are my

52
00:02:59,959 --> 00:03:11,689
two children they're much older than

53
00:03:05,209 --> 00:03:14,000
this now mikey is now 270 pounds Alice

54
00:03:11,689 --> 00:03:18,709
almost as tall as I am she's centre of

55
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:20,389
our basketball team so but when I was

56
00:03:18,709 --> 00:03:21,950
their age maybe a little bit older the

57
00:03:20,389 --> 00:03:22,649
one thing I always wanted was have a

58
00:03:21,949 --> 00:03:24,780
farm

59
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:28,079
you know it's just something in 16 years

60
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:29,848
ago my wife and I we got that

61
00:03:28,079 --> 00:03:33,000
opportunity so we bought a hundred and

62
00:03:29,848 --> 00:03:36,328
two acre farm just south of Danby and

63
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,219
then the house wasn't habitable so we

64
00:03:36,329 --> 00:03:40,260
had to rebuild the house and when that

65
00:03:38,219 --> 00:03:44,459
finished we started farming the property

66
00:03:40,259 --> 00:03:48,929
and so we have chickens and eggs we used

67
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:50,000
to have goats a lot of cats but I

68
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:52,680
learned a lot

69
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,169
you know from agriculture and how it

70
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:57,060
helps me at Cornell running the lab when

71
00:03:55,169 --> 00:03:59,988
I first came to the farm I talked to my

72
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:03,239
neighbor who was farming it and his

73
00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:06,840
comment to me was that Cornell wasn't

74
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:09,870
useful tool much anymore and so when I

75
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:11,729
got the opportunity to come back to

76
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:14,489
crocosaurus I was at the USDA at the

77
00:04:11,729 --> 00:04:17,488
time to direct the lab I decided I was

78
00:04:14,489 --> 00:04:20,449
going to change that I wanted our lab to

79
00:04:17,488 --> 00:04:23,189
be useful to actu farmers again and so

80
00:04:20,449 --> 00:04:25,500
my experiences on the farm helped me to

81
00:04:23,189 --> 00:04:27,329
develop new methods because the methods

82
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:29,699
are in place except for the soil testing

83
00:04:27,329 --> 00:04:32,698
was we were able to tell them what went

84
00:04:29,699 --> 00:04:35,699
wrong after it happened and as a farmer

85
00:04:32,699 --> 00:04:36,870
you want to know what do I need to do to

86
00:04:35,699 --> 00:04:39,449
prevent it from happening in the first

87
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:46,769
place so we started developing methods

88
00:04:39,449 --> 00:04:48,930
for that this is I guess a slot or what

89
00:04:46,769 --> 00:04:50,609
we have in our soil health program and

90
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:52,889
if they quote from Thomas Jefferson he

91
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:56,038
writes well the farmer holds the title

92
00:04:52,889 --> 00:04:59,098
to the land actually belongs to all the

93
00:04:56,038 --> 00:05:03,269
people because civilization itself rests

94
00:04:59,098 --> 00:05:05,579
upon the soil and sometimes you farm it

95
00:05:03,269 --> 00:05:08,879
you begin to appreciate the importance

96
00:05:05,579 --> 00:05:11,658
of soil and agriculture and what happens

97
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:11,658
if we lose it

98
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:18,000
why is it important I've come to believe

99
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:19,500
agriculture is important to us not only

100
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,189
as a food source but as a familiar

101
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:26,218
experience accessible to everyone that

102
00:05:23,189 --> 00:05:29,870
can help that it can help us understand

103
00:05:26,218 --> 00:05:33,478
many aspects of life nature in science

104
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:37,848
agriculture is a practice so rooted in

105
00:05:33,478 --> 00:05:41,128
reality that it can guide our decisions

106
00:05:37,848 --> 00:05:43,019
so I in you know in this growing up this

107
00:05:41,129 --> 00:05:44,550
millennial age I guess we sometimes

108
00:05:43,019 --> 00:05:46,019
think we're sort of the center of the

109
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:48,419
universe everything is right there for

110
00:05:46,019 --> 00:05:50,250
us whatever we want we just turn it on

111
00:05:48,418 --> 00:05:51,658
we'd want this news cable now where we

112
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:54,060
just switch the channel and everything's

113
00:05:51,658 --> 00:05:57,288
there for us you realize that when

114
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:59,430
you're farming your life is guided by

115
00:05:57,288 --> 00:06:01,168
nature and what's around you when you

116
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:02,879
have to make decisions based on that you

117
00:06:01,168 --> 00:06:06,839
quickly learn that you're not the center

118
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:10,740
of the universe anymore referring for

119
00:06:06,839 --> 00:06:13,109
this presentation I realized our country

120
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:15,000
was founded not by lawyers but by a

121
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:17,158
bunch of farmers so if I don't go back

122
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,930
to the history of our country and that's

123
00:06:17,158 --> 00:06:21,509
why I say maybe that's the reason it

124
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:26,610
succeeded he understood the laws of

125
00:06:21,509 --> 00:06:30,560
nature that guided their decisions so

126
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:33,810
here's a section taken out of the

127
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:35,399
Declaration of Independence the wording

128
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:37,829
is kind of hard from back then but I'll

129
00:06:35,399 --> 00:06:39,929
read it when in the course of human

130
00:06:37,829 --> 00:06:42,838
events it becomes necessary for one

131
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:44,098
people to dissolve their political bands

132
00:06:42,838 --> 00:06:47,788
which have connected them with another

133
00:06:44,098 --> 00:06:50,009
and to assume among the powers of the

134
00:06:47,788 --> 00:06:52,500
earth the separate and equal station to

135
00:06:50,009 --> 00:06:56,370
which the laws of nature and of nature's

136
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:58,740
God entitle them a decent respect to the

137
00:06:56,370 --> 00:07:00,360
opinions of mankind requires that they

138
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:04,528
should declare the causes which impel

139
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:07,050
them to separate essentially what they

140
00:07:04,528 --> 00:07:09,538
probably from agriculture and

141
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:11,699
understanding the laws of nature they

142
00:07:09,538 --> 00:07:14,038
knew that the laws of nature and nature

143
00:07:11,699 --> 00:07:16,830
God gave them the right to become an

144
00:07:14,038 --> 00:07:19,860
independent nation that contributed to

145
00:07:16,829 --> 00:07:22,019
our forming an independent country so

146
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:24,699
I'm going to talk a little bit about how

147
00:07:22,019 --> 00:07:27,609
they felt about agriculture

148
00:07:24,699 --> 00:07:32,319
anta booth wrote that the founding

149
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:33,610
fathers believed that the first

150
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:35,349
President of the United States George

151
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:37,870
Washington John Adams Thomas Jefferson

152
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:39,010
and James Madison were revolutionary

153
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:42,850
farmers as much as they were

154
00:07:39,009 --> 00:07:45,009
revolutionary politicians they loved

155
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:47,140
farming and gardening so much that they

156
00:07:45,009 --> 00:07:48,430
gave that permanence even when engaged

157
00:07:47,139 --> 00:07:50,649
in war in politics

158
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:52,600
gardening or farming was central to

159
00:07:50,649 --> 00:07:55,389
their lives and they were and they were

160
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:58,290
truly the first environmentalists they

161
00:07:55,389 --> 00:08:01,750
believed independent small-scale farms

162
00:07:58,290 --> 00:08:03,910
whoops let me go back I'm gonna

163
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:05,620
highlight that they believed independent

164
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:07,900
small-scale farms are the building

165
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:09,879
blocks of the nation and one thing I

166
00:08:07,899 --> 00:08:12,579
became concerned about when I had a farm

167
00:08:09,879 --> 00:08:15,850
is that we're losing all of our small

168
00:08:12,579 --> 00:08:19,209
farms to industrial farming and we need

169
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:21,670
to find ways to go to go back to having

170
00:08:19,209 --> 00:08:26,109
more small-scale farms we got to put

171
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:28,420
things in balance and if affrights

172
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:30,520
that Jefferson believed that agriculture

173
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:33,039
should be the foundation of American

174
00:08:30,519 --> 00:08:35,949
Republic rather than industry that he

175
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:40,599
put more importance to to agriculture

176
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:42,580
than to industry George Washington

177
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:45,909
studied and implemented improved farming

178
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:47,259
methods throughout his life in fact he

179
00:08:45,909 --> 00:08:49,750
thought of himself first

180
00:08:47,259 --> 00:08:52,269
as a farmer Washington read the latest

181
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:54,250
works on agriculture and implemented the

182
00:08:52,269 --> 00:08:56,409
new husbandry methods using a variety of

183
00:08:54,250 --> 00:09:02,200
fertilization methods in crop rotation

184
00:08:56,409 --> 00:09:04,029
plans on his five farms interviews with

185
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:05,950
the National Republic radio and Ray

186
00:09:04,029 --> 00:09:11,230
Wolfe described the founding fathers as

187
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:14,530
obsessed with with manure so George

188
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:17,980
George Washington had this whoops keep

189
00:09:14,529 --> 00:09:22,069
hitting this instead of the had this

190
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:29,450
building built to arm for the storing

191
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:31,790
of compost from dunk for his gardens so

192
00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:34,190
agriculture places one in direct contact

193
00:09:31,789 --> 00:09:36,529
with nature it teaches us the laws of

194
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:38,930
nature you're forced to experience it

195
00:09:36,529 --> 00:09:41,600
firsthand you have to adapt your life to

196
00:09:38,929 --> 00:09:43,639
the way things are there is a cycle to

197
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:49,310
it that we need to learn it's just the

198
00:09:43,639 --> 00:09:51,590
way it is so some some history it's

199
00:09:49,309 --> 00:09:55,069
agriculture is all in its totally

200
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:59,120
involved in our culture from the soil

201
00:09:55,070 --> 00:10:01,250
health book I read that in ancient

202
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:04,460
writings such as the Bible the work in

203
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:09,470
the book of Genesis the word Adam means

204
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:11,780
red soil and that's reason is in this

205
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:15,110
just in this description human beings

206
00:10:11,779 --> 00:10:18,169
became came from the soil because soil

207
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:20,480
brought forth life some Native American

208
00:10:18,169 --> 00:10:22,969
Indian cultures treat the soil is a

209
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:25,310
living good neighbor they respect and

210
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:26,990
revere it and they talk about should

211
00:10:25,309 --> 00:10:29,000
walk on the soil like you're walking on

212
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:31,789
somebody's back you know you need to be

213
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,889
very gentle with it in one culture

214
00:10:31,789 --> 00:10:35,990
people take water from a well they first

215
00:10:33,889 --> 00:10:38,120
pour a portion of the water onto the

216
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:41,000
ground to give the soil a drink first

217
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:44,720
that's how much they respect and revered

218
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:46,970
the soil in many of today's developing

219
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:50,690
countries people view using too much

220
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:52,940
fertilizer as we may view taking illegal

221
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:55,460
drugs they see it as making the soil

222
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:57,140
addicted so they like to keep things in

223
00:10:55,460 --> 00:11:00,800
a natural way and that's why I think

224
00:10:57,139 --> 00:11:02,419
it's good to support organic farming we

225
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:04,039
are converting one of our fields to an

226
00:11:02,419 --> 00:11:08,149
organic farm and I know personally how

227
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:10,149
hard it is to pick up all those rocks it

228
00:11:08,149 --> 00:11:14,539
is not easy

229
00:11:10,149 --> 00:11:17,209
so things about agriculture how many of

230
00:11:14,539 --> 00:11:21,230
us put off studying for an exam or cram

231
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:23,300
the night before we all did it right so

232
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:25,009
and it's something that's but this

233
00:11:23,299 --> 00:11:27,889
approach doesn't work in agriculture you

234
00:11:25,009 --> 00:11:29,269
can't procrastinate you know how many of

235
00:11:27,889 --> 00:11:31,399
us know a farmer that can put off

236
00:11:29,269 --> 00:11:32,960
milking your cows until Friday or the

237
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:35,750
night before a test before he wants to

238
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:39,960
do the milking you can't do that

239
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:42,299
can we cram our Faulk can we cram in the

240
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:45,269
fall for a crop harvest no we have to

241
00:11:42,299 --> 00:11:47,069
plant in the spring in the spring in the

242
00:11:45,269 --> 00:11:50,699
summer you begin harvesting wood for the

243
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:53,250
winter when the weather is right or or

244
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:55,710
you have five consecutive days of Sun

245
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:57,720
and the hay is tall enough to harvest

246
00:11:55,710 --> 00:12:01,019
that's time you harvest hay

247
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:03,120
so your life is basically controlled by

248
00:12:01,019 --> 00:12:04,889
your climate and by your weather you

249
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:07,230
can't have it the way always the way you

250
00:12:04,889 --> 00:12:13,049
want it and you learned that very

251
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:15,210
quickly so some goat stories the only

252
00:12:13,049 --> 00:12:20,969
good thing about having these goats it

253
00:12:15,210 --> 00:12:26,009
gave me lots of good material we've had

254
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:29,580
a couple of goats we well first of all

255
00:12:26,009 --> 00:12:32,120
my son had problems with the tolerance

256
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:34,590
to milk so I told my neighbor about

257
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:37,019
maybe we'll try looking at getting some

258
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:39,750
goats too because I hear that was better

259
00:12:37,019 --> 00:12:41,039
for milk and tolerance two weeks late or

260
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:43,379
two goats showed up and I've never

261
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:45,509
touched a goat before okay they were

262
00:12:43,379 --> 00:12:46,980
pregnant and they needed to be milked so

263
00:12:45,509 --> 00:12:48,960
I had to quickly learn with them a

264
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:51,529
couple it within hours out of milk a

265
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:55,200
goat we had no place to store him but

266
00:12:51,529 --> 00:13:00,389
anyway so what experience to experience

267
00:12:55,200 --> 00:13:02,940
as I had with them was the two of the

268
00:13:00,389 --> 00:13:04,740
babies were born and they needed they

269
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:06,930
couldn't milk off to the mother so I had

270
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:09,659
to battle feed them so I was getting

271
00:13:06,929 --> 00:13:11,879
down to ten degrees one night so I took

272
00:13:09,659 --> 00:13:14,279
him up and up the bathroom off of our

273
00:13:11,879 --> 00:13:16,200
bathroom off of our bedroom went down to

274
00:13:14,279 --> 00:13:17,429
get the milk and came up and it got out

275
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:20,070
of the bathroom they were standing next

276
00:13:17,429 --> 00:13:21,539
to the bed as soon as I seen me open the

277
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:28,010
door and come in they jumped on the bed

278
00:13:21,539 --> 00:13:30,959
and started peeing so anyway so

279
00:13:28,009 --> 00:13:33,480
fortunately the plastic shipping

280
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:35,240
container was still on the mattress all

281
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:37,350
the bedding was up against the headboard

282
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:40,259
against the wall and the only nailed the

283
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:41,909
sheet but the worst part was when they

284
00:13:40,259 --> 00:13:43,409
see me rush over to get them they

285
00:13:41,909 --> 00:13:45,149
squatted down you could see him trying

286
00:13:43,409 --> 00:13:46,949
to squeeze it all out before I got there

287
00:13:45,149 --> 00:13:49,269
now they're only two weeks old

288
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:51,759
that's how mischievous goats are

289
00:13:49,269 --> 00:13:54,610
then when I was building that Hut there

290
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:56,860
that I would I had it laid down on the

291
00:13:54,610 --> 00:13:59,019
ground I was cutting it to length as

292
00:13:56,860 --> 00:14:02,169
soon as I went to pick it up they all

293
00:13:59,019 --> 00:14:04,569
jumped on it they have this immense

294
00:14:02,169 --> 00:14:07,089
sense the knowing what's the worst thing

295
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:10,930
they could do at that moment okay so

296
00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:13,149
questions some of our experiences the

297
00:14:10,929 --> 00:14:15,459
reality of goats they looked so cute and

298
00:14:13,149 --> 00:14:17,829
innocent don't they right they start out

299
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:21,160
so small I get but so what I learned

300
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:24,310
from them is how do you name a goat so I

301
00:14:21,159 --> 00:14:27,579
learned from personal experiences the

302
00:14:24,309 --> 00:14:29,559
first two names of all goats is exactly

303
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:36,040
the same you name a goat you give it its

304
00:14:29,559 --> 00:14:38,979
third name so in this case this is that

305
00:14:36,039 --> 00:14:40,929
damn brown ears okay so the first two

306
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:42,879
name for dos is that dam and then you

307
00:14:40,929 --> 00:14:46,539
put the name onto it so one thing I

308
00:14:42,879 --> 00:14:50,139
learned also about farming is just as

309
00:14:46,539 --> 00:14:52,539
our culture is you know a church I know

310
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:53,980
I understand in the Bible why Jesus put

311
00:14:52,539 --> 00:14:54,579
the sheep on his right and the goats on

312
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:57,159
his left

313
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:59,530
okay so there's just a lot of things

314
00:14:57,159 --> 00:15:03,819
about agriculture that you really learn

315
00:14:59,529 --> 00:15:06,179
firsthand the experience okay so tell

316
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:12,160
you a couple stories about my daughter

317
00:15:06,179 --> 00:15:15,519
she was she was adopted she's she's 11

318
00:15:12,159 --> 00:15:16,779
now she's going into fifth grade but

319
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:18,909
this year I think we she was in

320
00:15:16,779 --> 00:15:20,500
kindergarten and she was a little bit

321
00:15:18,909 --> 00:15:22,449
autistic so she couldn't speak to she

322
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:25,000
was about second year through

323
00:15:22,450 --> 00:15:27,190
kindergarten and so the therapist told

324
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,320
us we had to keep the animals because I

325
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:32,080
know so she was with them she would

326
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:34,990
speak more and so we had to keep him for

327
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:36,310
therapy for her so we wanted to think of

328
00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:38,919
getting rid of him we wondering how much

329
00:15:36,309 --> 00:15:40,059
was it going to cost to keep him we

330
00:15:38,919 --> 00:15:42,209
weighed that against what she was

331
00:15:40,059 --> 00:15:44,769
learning and we decided to keep him and

332
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:45,910
so when she was forced the first thing

333
00:15:44,769 --> 00:15:47,559
she didn't she had the chickens she

334
00:15:45,909 --> 00:15:49,659
decided that before they could all go

335
00:15:47,559 --> 00:15:51,969
out free-ranging they all had to pass

336
00:15:49,659 --> 00:15:55,870
their flying test and she gave them all

337
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:58,060
flying lessons to him up in the air let

338
00:15:55,870 --> 00:16:00,429
him come down anyway so then she got her

339
00:15:58,059 --> 00:16:03,029
cutter friends how to give chickens

340
00:16:00,429 --> 00:16:06,479
flying lessons that was hilarious

341
00:16:03,029 --> 00:16:08,819
so we're wondering what is she what is

342
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:13,110
she learning and so she's watching the

343
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:15,060
little bill show and little bill Scott

344
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:16,860
there's a bunny rabbits from school that

345
00:16:15,059 --> 00:16:19,259
he wants to adopt into his apartment in

346
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:20,600
Philadelphia his father tells him no and

347
00:16:19,259 --> 00:16:23,759
he lists all the reasons

348
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:25,470
well mr. bills are a little bill had

349
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:26,970
already thought that problems out and

350
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:27,360
he's got a solution for every one of

351
00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:30,120
them

352
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:31,889
now his father's got no recourse left

353
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:34,049
but to consider letting him have these

354
00:16:31,889 --> 00:16:37,769
let him have these five rabbit or eight

355
00:16:34,049 --> 00:16:40,289
rabbits Ellis ceased that happen on the

356
00:16:37,769 --> 00:16:42,210
TV she looks up at the earth television

357
00:16:40,289 --> 00:16:47,579
to give mr. bill some advice and she

358
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:52,769
says no no no those rabbits will poop a

359
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:57,420
lot and so by the age of five she has

360
00:16:52,769 --> 00:16:59,309
waste management and scaled down I told

361
00:16:57,419 --> 00:17:01,409
this to my neighbor I said she's really

362
00:16:59,309 --> 00:17:03,929
learning a lot from being on the farm he

363
00:17:01,409 --> 00:17:05,849
says yes she already knows she has now

364
00:17:03,929 --> 00:17:07,289
already by the age of five has more

365
00:17:05,849 --> 00:17:10,649
insight than half of the faculty in the

366
00:17:07,289 --> 00:17:13,980
College of Agriculture okay so one last

367
00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:16,380
story she's now in first grade at South

368
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:18,120
Hill and she's getting always gets books

369
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:20,580
on nature cuz she wants to be a

370
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:22,709
naturalist and she loves the woods and

371
00:17:20,579 --> 00:17:25,649
she loves the animals and so this little

372
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:28,170
this book in this book this girl gets a

373
00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:30,600
baby goat for a birthday it turns out

374
00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:33,210
that every day it would go into it's hot

375
00:17:30,599 --> 00:17:34,980
in the wintertime it would snow so after

376
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:37,710
several times this happening the gopis

377
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:39,769
in the hut it snows the girl thing she's

378
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:42,470
got a goat that can forecast the weather

379
00:17:39,769 --> 00:17:45,839
so the next time it goes into its Hut

380
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:47,490
she calls up all this radio stations in

381
00:17:45,839 --> 00:17:50,490
the news companies and they come down

382
00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:53,730
and it didn't snow she's devastated so

383
00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:55,200
she goes into the heart to see why the

384
00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:56,610
goat was in there and it didn't snow

385
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,890
well it turned out the goat had given

386
00:17:56,609 --> 00:18:00,179
birth to two baby kids and that's why it

387
00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:03,210
had to go into the hot without it

388
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:06,000
snowing well I didn't catch on quick

389
00:18:03,210 --> 00:18:09,769
enough my daughter turns to that front

390
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:12,599
page sizes up the horns on that coat

391
00:18:09,769 --> 00:18:14,940
that goat there was no access to a billy

392
00:18:12,599 --> 00:18:17,899
goat on the farm there's no way that

393
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:17,900
goat could have gotten pregnant

394
00:18:18,169 --> 00:18:23,519
dad author then had no credibility right

395
00:18:21,749 --> 00:18:25,710
she turns over to one of the previous

396
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:28,048
pages looks at the picture of the farm

397
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:31,919
animals in the corner and says dad that

398
00:18:28,048 --> 00:18:34,859
Mouse doesn't belong there either so so

399
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:38,210
it's part of our culture we really kids

400
00:18:34,859 --> 00:18:40,548
learn a lot okay

401
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:42,869
agriculture is a source of routine

402
00:18:40,548 --> 00:18:44,999
micronutrient malnutrition affect over 2

403
00:18:42,868 --> 00:18:47,339
billion people resulting in poor health

404
00:18:44,999 --> 00:18:48,960
including coronary heart disease and so

405
00:18:47,339 --> 00:18:53,849
these are all the important reasons for

406
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:56,100
agriculture agriculture just more than

407
00:18:53,849 --> 00:18:58,138
the source of food nutrition we have the

408
00:18:56,099 --> 00:19:00,388
old soil management and research in

409
00:18:58,138 --> 00:19:02,990
agriculture but I found I was greatly

410
00:19:00,388 --> 00:19:06,628
affected by climate change

411
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:08,159
so farming has taught me the importance

412
00:19:06,628 --> 00:19:10,439
of keeping a system in balance

413
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:12,299
whenever I failed to comply with the

414
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:15,590
laws of nature and the system went out

415
00:19:12,298 --> 00:19:18,058
of balance it didn't end well for me

416
00:19:15,589 --> 00:19:19,798
agricultural policy needs to needs

417
00:19:18,058 --> 00:19:22,769
accommodation both theory and practice

418
00:19:19,798 --> 00:19:25,528
and I'm very appreciative for my

419
00:19:22,769 --> 00:19:28,740
education at Cornell and so forth but I

420
00:19:25,528 --> 00:19:29,999
also learned that a good education helps

421
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:32,519
prevent us from being deceived by

422
00:19:29,999 --> 00:19:34,470
ignorance and some sense of spirituality

423
00:19:32,519 --> 00:19:36,839
and understanding of the laws of nature

424
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:39,389
and complying with them can help us from

425
00:19:36,839 --> 00:19:41,428
being deceived by her intellect and when

426
00:19:39,388 --> 00:19:43,319
we're always surrounded by education I

427
00:19:41,429 --> 00:19:46,048
think there's a tendency for us in

428
00:19:43,319 --> 00:19:48,538
academic institutions to think that our

429
00:19:46,048 --> 00:19:50,220
intellect is infallible and the first

430
00:19:48,538 --> 00:19:51,690
thing I learned on a farm when I got the

431
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:53,610
farm was my neighborhoods a farmer knew

432
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:56,490
a lot more than I did so I had a lot of

433
00:19:53,609 --> 00:20:01,378
theoretical practices but I needed some

434
00:19:56,490 --> 00:20:04,618
common sense to go with it so

435
00:20:01,378 --> 00:20:07,558
agriculture and climate change so I can

436
00:20:04,618 --> 00:20:10,769
explore the connections so my my

437
00:20:07,558 --> 00:20:14,220
expertise in chemistry that perspective

438
00:20:10,769 --> 00:20:18,960
and how I understand climate change

439
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:21,538
based as a spectroscopy this is in the

440
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:24,990
at least in this ethic in New York your

441
00:20:21,538 --> 00:20:27,858
life expectancy is much longer claiming

442
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:30,329
to be the Son of God than it is if you

443
00:20:27,858 --> 00:20:31,889
come up or even propose the

444
00:20:30,329 --> 00:20:34,439
possibilities that climate change may be

445
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:35,940
due to natural causes okay so what I'm

446
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:39,710
going to tell you why as a spectroscopy

447
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:39,710
so I think that it may be the case

448
00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:45,659
there's science of the founding fathers

449
00:20:42,538 --> 00:20:47,940
this belief that experience meant that

450
00:20:45,659 --> 00:20:50,130
nature was the highest authority over

451
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:52,980
ruling and between any human authority

452
00:20:50,130 --> 00:20:54,510
this point of view was encapsulated in

453
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:57,048
the model from the Royal Society to

454
00:20:54,509 --> 00:21:02,009
premier scientific xiety in the world

455
00:20:57,048 --> 00:21:04,048
nullus in verba in other words in on the

456
00:21:02,009 --> 00:21:07,200
words of no one so in other words check

457
00:21:04,048 --> 00:21:10,288
it out for yourself so I think some of

458
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:12,090
the evidence of this and like exciting

459
00:21:10,288 --> 00:21:14,190
it was important to check out for myself

460
00:21:12,089 --> 00:21:16,168
and I have a pretty good background in

461
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:17,909
chemistry and in some in physical

462
00:21:16,169 --> 00:21:22,350
chemistry so I started looking into this

463
00:21:17,909 --> 00:21:25,470
more deeply because how we approach

464
00:21:22,349 --> 00:21:27,750
climate change tells us how what

465
00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:29,880
adaptive methods we need to employ in

466
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:36,450
use if we use the wrong ones it could

467
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:38,460
end bad so here's the the mechanism for

468
00:21:36,450 --> 00:21:42,080
climate change basically you have energy

469
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:45,000
coming into the earth some of it leaving

470
00:21:42,079 --> 00:21:47,788
up into the atmosphere and then some of

471
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:50,009
it coming back down and this back

472
00:21:47,788 --> 00:21:54,148
radiation they say is about 340 watts

473
00:21:50,009 --> 00:21:57,240
per meter squared and so with the net

474
00:21:54,148 --> 00:21:59,009
what's going out is 239 and so there's

475
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:01,528
basically we're accumulating a little

476
00:21:59,009 --> 00:22:08,398
more energy than what's going out but

477
00:22:01,528 --> 00:22:10,138
what's the mechanism for it so global

478
00:22:08,398 --> 00:22:12,178
warming and climate change are both real

479
00:22:10,138 --> 00:22:16,079
and serious issues that we need to

480
00:22:12,179 --> 00:22:17,909
address I experienced them firsthand but

481
00:22:16,079 --> 00:22:21,480
we need to be careful that we don't get

482
00:22:17,909 --> 00:22:23,399
blindsided by causes other than co2 we

483
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:29,480
need to get the mechanism of greenhouse

484
00:22:23,398 --> 00:22:32,638
effect correct so the current model

485
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:34,288
confuses the word thermal equilibrium

486
00:22:32,638 --> 00:22:37,548
with steady state that would that's

487
00:22:34,288 --> 00:22:39,919
their first mistake the second is

488
00:22:37,548 --> 00:22:42,288
take is it only recognizes kerckhoffs

489
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:43,159
law and ignores the effect of thermal

490
00:22:42,288 --> 00:22:45,859
collisions

491
00:22:43,159 --> 00:22:48,019
I'll explain these independent later

492
00:22:45,859 --> 00:22:50,689
coughs law has got some flaws in it to

493
00:22:48,019 --> 00:22:53,359
begin with we need to recognize that

494
00:22:50,690 --> 00:22:55,519
spectral displays that you see come off

495
00:22:53,359 --> 00:22:57,319
an instrument are distorted and can lead

496
00:22:55,519 --> 00:23:02,808
to erroneous conclusion so all these

497
00:22:57,319 --> 00:23:04,189
things need to be taken into effect when

498
00:23:02,808 --> 00:23:07,069
the circumstances are taken into

499
00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:08,749
consideration it is possible that the

500
00:23:07,069 --> 00:23:11,089
amount of atmosphere needed to create

501
00:23:08,749 --> 00:23:14,419
the greenhouse effect would be reduced

502
00:23:11,089 --> 00:23:17,058
from 12 to 16,000 feet down to about 350

503
00:23:14,419 --> 00:23:19,879
feet resulting in thousands of feet of

504
00:23:17,058 --> 00:23:22,460
extra asthma sphere not used to warm the

505
00:23:19,878 --> 00:23:24,888
atmosphere so some of the limiting

506
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:27,710
factor controlling building warming may

507
00:23:24,888 --> 00:23:30,069
not be co2 but sunlight so what the

508
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:34,909
spectroscopy evidence suggests is that

509
00:23:30,069 --> 00:23:38,928
if this is 16,000 feet and there's an

510
00:23:34,909 --> 00:23:41,269
that is required and there's still

511
00:23:38,929 --> 00:23:43,570
radiation getting up to that height then

512
00:23:41,269 --> 00:23:45,769
adding more co2 to the atmosphere would

513
00:23:43,569 --> 00:23:48,288
increase global warming so human

514
00:23:45,769 --> 00:23:50,569
activity would have an effect however if

515
00:23:48,288 --> 00:23:53,720
the amount of co2 in the app if there's

516
00:23:50,569 --> 00:23:55,849
enough co2 in the atmosphere at 350 feet

517
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:57,288
to absorb all the radiation that's

518
00:23:55,849 --> 00:23:59,298
coming off the surface of the earth

519
00:23:57,288 --> 00:24:01,970
that's that infrared radiation then all

520
00:23:59,298 --> 00:24:04,908
of this from from here up to the outer

521
00:24:01,970 --> 00:24:06,528
space is now extra and so adding more to

522
00:24:04,909 --> 00:24:08,570
the natural extra that's already there

523
00:24:06,528 --> 00:24:12,849
is not going to change the outcome or

524
00:24:08,569 --> 00:24:12,849
very little change into the outcome so

525
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:22,608
to begin with based some basic physical

526
00:24:19,099 --> 00:24:23,888
chemistry there there are four types of

527
00:24:22,608 --> 00:24:26,480
kinetic energy

528
00:24:23,888 --> 00:24:29,089
translation lens uses thermal heat row

529
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:31,819
tenant rotational energy which we know

530
00:24:29,089 --> 00:24:34,128
as microwave energy vibrational energy

531
00:24:31,819 --> 00:24:36,138
which is infrared electromagnetic

532
00:24:34,128 --> 00:24:38,868
radiation which is the lights that you

533
00:24:36,138 --> 00:24:41,538
see that's when electrons from an

534
00:24:38,868 --> 00:24:44,839
excited state go back to a ground state

535
00:24:41,538 --> 00:24:47,148
so the Maxwell Boltzmann equation for

536
00:24:44,839 --> 00:24:49,329
thermal equilibrium predicts the ratio

537
00:24:47,148 --> 00:24:51,689
of excited state of the electrons both

538
00:24:49,329 --> 00:24:53,398
vibrational rotational

539
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:56,159
to the ground state is a function of

540
00:24:53,398 --> 00:24:58,319
temperature so right here that's in

541
00:24:56,159 --> 00:25:00,990
degrees Kelvin so this is your ground

542
00:24:58,319 --> 00:25:04,439
state this is your excited state so it

543
00:25:00,990 --> 00:25:09,628
says that when when energy we're not

544
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:12,058
when there's excitation of co2 the this

545
00:25:09,628 --> 00:25:14,428
is going to get excited more as you get

546
00:25:12,058 --> 00:25:17,579
increased temperature and this predicts

547
00:25:14,429 --> 00:25:21,629
how much it will be excited so it's all

548
00:25:17,579 --> 00:25:23,908
based on excitation of of your element

549
00:25:21,628 --> 00:25:26,189
of your compound of interest by

550
00:25:23,909 --> 00:25:28,110
temperature and so when you have

551
00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:31,528
radiation coming from the surface of the

552
00:25:28,109 --> 00:25:34,138
earth plus temperature imposing on co2

553
00:25:31,528 --> 00:25:37,259
then the NB over na becomes

554
00:25:34,138 --> 00:25:39,750
overpopulated the amount of excited co2

555
00:25:37,259 --> 00:25:41,940
is now greater than what is predicted by

556
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:44,548
this equation that's why they should use

557
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:54,269
the term steady state and not thermal

558
00:25:44,548 --> 00:25:56,759
equilibrium I think this is the place

559
00:25:54,269 --> 00:25:58,980
mention it's probably the most abused

560
00:25:56,759 --> 00:26:00,839
equation in science because nobody

561
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:02,579
really understands they use it without

562
00:26:00,839 --> 00:26:05,490
totally understanding what it means so

563
00:26:02,579 --> 00:26:07,019
the global more modeling is based on the

564
00:26:05,490 --> 00:26:08,819
assumption that the Earth's surface and

565
00:26:07,019 --> 00:26:12,058
the atmosphere being in thermal

566
00:26:08,819 --> 00:26:14,369
equilibrium this is not the case because

567
00:26:12,058 --> 00:26:16,918
the equation holds to if the source of

568
00:26:14,369 --> 00:26:18,268
energy is thermal in the case of global

569
00:26:16,919 --> 00:26:20,179
warming we are dealing with both

570
00:26:18,269 --> 00:26:23,038
radiational energy and thermal energy

571
00:26:20,179 --> 00:26:25,379
also these energies are in constant

572
00:26:23,038 --> 00:26:28,700
state of flux so the system is at steady

573
00:26:25,378 --> 00:26:31,769
state and at thermal equilibrium so for

574
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:34,740
for the excited state of co2 at the 4

575
00:26:31,769 --> 00:26:36,929
micron peak it's about 0.03 percent at

576
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:40,440
the 15 micron peak it's about 2 percent

577
00:26:36,929 --> 00:26:43,019
if you plug about 300 degrees Kelvin or

578
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:45,778
270 degrees Kelvin in that is for

579
00:26:43,019 --> 00:26:47,370
temperature so when Co tubes absorbs

580
00:26:45,778 --> 00:26:49,490
infrared radiation from the surface of

581
00:26:47,369 --> 00:26:52,018
the earth the excited state becomes

582
00:26:49,490 --> 00:26:54,740
overpopulating keeping it from being in

583
00:26:52,019 --> 00:26:54,740
thermal equilibrium

584
00:26:58,130 --> 00:27:04,980
the mechanism for global warming is

585
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:07,620
based on kirchoff's law and that is a

586
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:09,509
good absorber of radiation it's also a

587
00:27:07,619 --> 00:27:12,269
good emitter of radiation and for the

588
00:27:09,509 --> 00:27:16,319
most part that's generally true but in

589
00:27:12,269 --> 00:27:17,430
infrared radiation IR radiation rating

590
00:27:16,319 --> 00:27:20,549
from the surface of the earth is

591
00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:23,730
observed by co2 the co2 then becomes

592
00:27:20,549 --> 00:27:26,759
excited and then it releases the

593
00:27:23,730 --> 00:27:28,190
infrared radiation in all directions the

594
00:27:26,759 --> 00:27:30,869
earth absorbs some of the Rays

595
00:27:28,190 --> 00:27:33,789
converting it

596
00:27:30,869 --> 00:27:36,549
converting it to back to or back to

597
00:27:33,789 --> 00:27:38,710
blackbody radiation then warming of the

598
00:27:36,549 --> 00:27:41,740
air happens through convection so

599
00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:44,350
essentially the radiation is coming up

600
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:46,900
from the earth it hits the co2 the co2

601
00:27:44,349 --> 00:27:48,579
absorbs that radiation from one

602
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:51,070
direction but it releases it in all

603
00:27:48,579 --> 00:27:54,339
directions because the ground absorbs

604
00:27:51,069 --> 00:27:57,009
that radiation there's a net direction

605
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:58,539
down towards the earth so there's less

606
00:27:57,009 --> 00:28:01,000
of it going up the atmosphere more of

607
00:27:58,539 --> 00:28:02,500
it's coming down to the earth and that's

608
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,990
where they get that forcing mechanism

609
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:07,269
and the what they call the greenhouse

610
00:28:04,990 --> 00:28:12,569
effect but there's some problems with

611
00:28:07,269 --> 00:28:18,369
that what they didn't take into account

612
00:28:12,569 --> 00:28:20,769
is the fact that nitrogen and oxygen are

613
00:28:18,369 --> 00:28:24,489
combining are colliding with that

614
00:28:20,769 --> 00:28:27,819
excited co2 in a rate of about three

615
00:28:24,490 --> 00:28:30,849
billion times a second so at that point

616
00:28:27,819 --> 00:28:33,849
instead of just the radiation warming to

617
00:28:30,849 --> 00:28:36,969
ground it directly warms the air around

618
00:28:33,849 --> 00:28:39,909
it so under those conditions instead of

619
00:28:36,970 --> 00:28:41,890
needing a lot of atmosphere to direct

620
00:28:39,910 --> 00:28:43,960
the light back down to the earth you

621
00:28:41,890 --> 00:28:47,530
only need you need a much smaller volume

622
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:51,670
of atmosphere making more accessible and

623
00:28:47,529 --> 00:28:55,480
excess so what they say is that when you

624
00:28:51,670 --> 00:28:57,400
look at this spectrum here there's a

625
00:28:55,480 --> 00:29:02,470
serious problem here does anybody know

626
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:08,800
what it is the tops of these things are

627
00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:11,319
all flat nobody know why that is it's

628
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:13,299
basically because the radiation from the

629
00:29:11,319 --> 00:29:15,700
ground isn't getting to outer space it's

630
00:29:13,299 --> 00:29:17,950
all absorbed the other thing you notice

631
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:21,309
is the water makes up about 98 percent

632
00:29:17,950 --> 00:29:23,630
of the greenhouse gases so all the

633
00:29:21,309 --> 00:29:26,960
shaded areas here

634
00:29:23,630 --> 00:29:29,570
is energy that's being absorbed and

635
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:32,360
prevented in warming the earth all the

636
00:29:29,569 --> 00:29:34,730
white areas here is the emission and

637
00:29:32,359 --> 00:29:37,099
going back to outer space cooling the

638
00:29:34,730 --> 00:29:38,870
earth and what makes it was the warmer

639
00:29:37,099 --> 00:29:44,679
cold is how these things are kept in

640
00:29:38,869 --> 00:29:47,119
balance so if this is already saturated

641
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:48,860
adding more how much is that going to

642
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:51,139
affect global what is equity increase

643
00:29:48,859 --> 00:29:54,679
global warming by adding more co2 when

644
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:57,500
it's already saturated and that depends

645
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:59,330
on the altitude that all this takes

646
00:29:57,500 --> 00:30:01,940
place at and that's the one thing that

647
00:29:59,329 --> 00:30:10,789
we don't have a direct measure of okay

648
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:16,700
so this is a paper by hung and Barrett

649
00:30:10,789 --> 00:30:19,549
versus IPC IPCC and here's what it shows

650
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:23,870
some very interesting results so you see

651
00:30:19,549 --> 00:30:27,859
this first curve here this is co2 alone

652
00:30:23,869 --> 00:30:31,519
in an ampule in a vial or to that and it

653
00:30:27,859 --> 00:30:34,879
absorbs this much radiation when you add

654
00:30:31,519 --> 00:30:36,980
helium to it absorbs more radiation when

655
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:40,550
you add nitrogen to it the radiation

656
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:43,250
that absorbs is three times more so that

657
00:30:40,549 --> 00:30:46,909
means that when co2 is colliding with

658
00:30:43,250 --> 00:30:49,759
nitrogen and oxygen it's making more co2

659
00:30:46,910 --> 00:30:52,190
atoms or molecules available for

660
00:30:49,759 --> 00:30:54,920
absorption increasing its efficiency as

661
00:30:52,190 --> 00:30:57,230
a greenhouse gas being again you need

662
00:30:54,920 --> 00:31:00,910
less atmosphere than what's predicted if

663
00:30:57,230 --> 00:31:03,620
you only look at the Kirkhof mechanism

664
00:31:00,910 --> 00:31:06,080
so the IBC claims that the doubling of

665
00:31:03,619 --> 00:31:08,839
co2 concentration would widen the

666
00:31:06,079 --> 00:31:11,419
absorption spectra for co2 and that's

667
00:31:08,839 --> 00:31:13,879
this area between the pink and the black

668
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:15,410
line that I put in okay so the spectra

669
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:17,690
comes down and it winds out at the

670
00:31:15,410 --> 00:31:21,080
bottom and what they're saying is that

671
00:31:17,690 --> 00:31:23,630
well if you double the co2 then this

672
00:31:21,079 --> 00:31:25,539
white area where the light or the

673
00:31:23,630 --> 00:31:27,980
radiation state to outer space who gets

674
00:31:25,539 --> 00:31:32,930
smaller because this would start to fill

675
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:35,539
in with the co2 absorption and I I don't

676
00:31:32,930 --> 00:31:37,430
think that's going to happen and from a

677
00:31:35,539 --> 00:31:40,159
spectroscopy of view

678
00:31:37,430 --> 00:31:42,740
we know that these images have

679
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:45,259
distortions in them and so you can't

680
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:48,140
directly until you have to realize that

681
00:31:45,259 --> 00:31:50,779
this absorption peak is actually wider

682
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:52,550
than what's displayed so there's a lot

683
00:31:50,779 --> 00:31:53,960
of distortions and these spectrometers

684
00:31:52,549 --> 00:31:55,970
and you need to be aware of that when

685
00:31:53,960 --> 00:32:00,049
you do your calculations so what they're

686
00:31:55,970 --> 00:32:01,730
saying is that the IPCC is saying that

687
00:32:00,049 --> 00:32:04,250
for point this would account for an

688
00:32:01,730 --> 00:32:06,920
additional 4.3 watts per meter square of

689
00:32:04,250 --> 00:32:08,900
energy coming back to the earth I'm

690
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:14,420
saying that's probably not going to

691
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:16,009
happen and explain why so here's I'm

692
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:18,019
sorry about this slide I'm not very good

693
00:32:16,009 --> 00:32:20,750
at PowerPoint but if you were to have a

694
00:32:18,019 --> 00:32:23,809
perfect spectrometer that was going to

695
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:25,789
image exactly the radiation pattern that

696
00:32:23,809 --> 00:32:28,879
is entering it but you would have would

697
00:32:25,789 --> 00:32:32,690
be the straight blue green and red lines

698
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:34,790
with nothing in the middle okay but when

699
00:32:32,690 --> 00:32:37,519
the light enters into a spectrometer it

700
00:32:34,789 --> 00:32:39,139
gets distorted because of the grating

701
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:41,629
the width of the entrance slit the width

702
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:46,700
of the exit slit D the lenses

703
00:32:41,630 --> 00:32:48,740
whatever's used to image the light or

704
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:51,259
the energy coming in it ends up being

705
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:54,559
distorted so it shifts it to the left

706
00:32:51,259 --> 00:32:57,140
and to the right so you see this line

707
00:32:54,559 --> 00:33:00,740
here this is it let's say this green

708
00:32:57,140 --> 00:33:05,650
light is 500 nanometers so the emission

709
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:09,200
coming at 495 is not a wavelength of 495

710
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:13,519
it's a wavelength of 500 that has been

711
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:15,110
displayed at 495 so that means you when

712
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:17,930
you look at the spectra the only part

713
00:33:15,109 --> 00:33:20,779
that's accurate part of the spectrum is

714
00:33:17,930 --> 00:33:23,420
what's exactly in the center and what's

715
00:33:20,779 --> 00:33:25,250
on the edges is distortions and you need

716
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:31,460
to keep that in mind when you're making

717
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:31,910
your interpretation so here's what

718
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:33,319
happened

719
00:33:31,910 --> 00:33:36,259
it's sort of like this here's me

720
00:33:33,319 --> 00:33:38,689
throwing a basketball and you notice

721
00:33:36,259 --> 00:33:41,390
that when you take a picture of it

722
00:33:38,690 --> 00:33:46,809
because you can't have an an instant

723
00:33:41,390 --> 00:33:51,259
image it gets distorted okay

724
00:33:46,809 --> 00:33:53,059
here's a close-up of it okay this same

725
00:33:51,259 --> 00:33:56,450
effect is the same thing that happens

726
00:33:53,059 --> 00:33:58,609
inside a spectrometer so you've got to

727
00:33:56,450 --> 00:34:03,610
know about understand this when you do

728
00:33:58,609 --> 00:34:05,599
calculate when you run calculations so

729
00:34:03,609 --> 00:34:08,509
those obviously claims that this

730
00:34:05,599 --> 00:34:11,150
doubling would be 4.3 and I'm saying the

731
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:13,400
reason this peak is is narrowing is not

732
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:15,380
matching the black line is because the

733
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:18,139
radiation in the white areas is spilling

734
00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:20,030
over into it preventing it from being as

735
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:24,460
wide as it really would be displayed if

736
00:34:20,030 --> 00:34:31,330
we had a perfect spectrometer and so

737
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:34,480
solis so the doctor hines hyung did an

738
00:34:31,329 --> 00:34:37,759
experiment he looked at he used a

739
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:39,219
high-res instrument and his conclusions

740
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:41,450
was that the amount of additional

741
00:34:39,219 --> 00:34:43,730
radiation coming back to the earth if

742
00:34:41,449 --> 00:34:48,168
you doubled co2 would be this small

743
00:34:43,730 --> 00:34:51,409
edges here in here and that the forcing

744
00:34:48,168 --> 00:34:54,259
would be only 0.05 4 watts per meter

745
00:34:51,409 --> 00:34:59,480
squared rather than the 4 point 3 that's

746
00:34:54,260 --> 00:35:03,200
predicted by the IPCC ok so the global

747
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:09,260
warming is going to be a lot less but if

748
00:35:03,199 --> 00:35:11,389
you increase co2 in the atmosphere I had

749
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:14,390
trouble finding any place that explained

750
00:35:11,389 --> 00:35:16,250
exactly how they do the calculations so

751
00:35:14,389 --> 00:35:19,129
I found this paper by the American

752
00:35:16,250 --> 00:35:21,650
Chemical Society that gave it a temp

753
00:35:19,130 --> 00:35:23,570
explaining it and what bothered me was

754
00:35:21,650 --> 00:35:27,110
the fact that it says this figure

755
00:35:23,570 --> 00:35:29,930
simulates what would happen if you had

756
00:35:27,110 --> 00:35:32,420
an imaginary atmosphere so I'm not sure

757
00:35:29,929 --> 00:35:34,879
how did they do their measurements that

758
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:37,039
they just take direct measurements or

759
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:38,300
did they just do a simulation to come up

760
00:35:37,039 --> 00:35:38,719
with these numbers that they're using

761
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:40,310
for

762
00:35:38,719 --> 00:35:42,199
what's going to happen if we increase

763
00:35:40,309 --> 00:35:43,989
co2 in our atmosphere how much is

764
00:35:42,199 --> 00:35:45,119
attempt you're going to change I'm not

765
00:35:43,989 --> 00:35:47,009
comforting

766
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:49,440
if people are just doing simulations

767
00:35:47,010 --> 00:35:51,390
rather than direct measurements you're

768
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:53,820
saying that the red line is wider than

769
00:35:51,389 --> 00:36:00,839
the blue line based on a simulation I

770
00:35:53,820 --> 00:36:02,610
don't know so I don't think there is

771
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:06,870
enough evidence to come to a definitive

772
00:36:02,610 --> 00:36:08,789
conclusion the material presented here

773
00:36:06,869 --> 00:36:11,549
needs to be taken given serious

774
00:36:08,789 --> 00:36:14,699
consideration and not we just accept the

775
00:36:11,550 --> 00:36:17,340
dogma that's out there to resolve this

776
00:36:14,699 --> 00:36:19,230
issue we need a direct measure and not a

777
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:20,430
model for the amount of atmosphere

778
00:36:19,230 --> 00:36:22,800
needed to create the greenhouse effect

779
00:36:20,429 --> 00:36:24,899
you know how much of the atmosphere is

780
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:26,880
extra this is important because we need

781
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:28,800
to know which adaptive strategies and

782
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:33,150
policies we need to implement that's

783
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:35,120
really critical for agriculture the

784
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:37,710
experiment we need to perform

785
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:39,389
we need neo to the concentration of co2

786
00:36:37,710 --> 00:36:41,699
at different locations around the earth

787
00:36:39,389 --> 00:36:43,650
what is the amount of co2 in the

788
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:46,230
atmosphere the limiting factor or is

789
00:36:43,650 --> 00:36:48,510
radiation from the Sun limiting if we

790
00:36:46,230 --> 00:36:50,940
add more co2 the atmosphere will it add

791
00:36:48,510 --> 00:36:53,610
to the greenhouse effect depends on the

792
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:55,400
altitude you have to go before all the

793
00:36:53,610 --> 00:36:58,470
radiation from the earth is absorbed

794
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:59,700
we need an experiment that measures the

795
00:36:58,469 --> 00:37:01,889
radiation from the earth that is

796
00:36:59,699 --> 00:37:04,409
observed by co2 at different elevations

797
00:37:01,889 --> 00:37:07,529
and the Earth's atmosphere one of the

798
00:37:04,409 --> 00:37:10,529
technical problems with infrared

799
00:37:07,530 --> 00:37:12,810
radiation and measuring it is that the

800
00:37:10,530 --> 00:37:14,700
infrared radiation also comes from the

801
00:37:12,809 --> 00:37:16,799
instrument itself and from the detector

802
00:37:14,699 --> 00:37:20,579
so the detector is measuring its own

803
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:23,970
radiation so technically you need to get

804
00:37:20,579 --> 00:37:27,480
the instrument chilled to like a minus

805
00:37:23,969 --> 00:37:28,559
40 degrees so that when you're when

806
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:29,940
you're doing your experiment the

807
00:37:28,559 --> 00:37:31,590
filament is about the same temperature

808
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:33,690
as the surface of the earth and 15

809
00:37:31,590 --> 00:37:38,780
degrees you don't kill the instrument

810
00:37:33,690 --> 00:37:38,780
then you can't see a difference okay so

811
00:37:40,789 --> 00:37:51,259
so this is some beers law and it talks

812
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:52,820
about how anything is absorbed how it

813
00:37:51,260 --> 00:38:00,140
goes straight and then it begins to tell

814
00:37:52,820 --> 00:38:03,820
off so if co2 absorbs goes about to 95%

815
00:38:00,139 --> 00:38:06,379
of CC at 12,000 feet adding more

816
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:08,000
anthropologic co2 would cause global

817
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:12,829
warming because this will continue up

818
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:16,420
very slowly okay and so if you've got if

819
00:38:12,829 --> 00:38:19,489
it takes all 12,000 to 16,000 feet

820
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:22,880
adding more co2 by us would make an

821
00:38:19,489 --> 00:38:25,549
effect if co2 absorption falls off at

822
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:27,860
about 1350 feet more co2 won't really

823
00:38:25,550 --> 00:38:29,630
matter it would all be extra and it

824
00:38:27,860 --> 00:38:32,269
would be like having a sponge pick up

825
00:38:29,630 --> 00:38:33,769
one teaspoon water adding 10 sponges

826
00:38:32,269 --> 00:38:35,900
isn't going to pick up any more water

827
00:38:33,769 --> 00:38:38,829
because you've already you already

828
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:41,510
absorbed all of it but almost all of it

829
00:38:38,829 --> 00:38:49,069
so here's my experiment now let's see if

830
00:38:41,510 --> 00:38:51,200
this works okay you block out the what

831
00:38:49,070 --> 00:38:53,420
was the so it starts off with a laser

832
00:38:51,199 --> 00:38:57,129
which is the source of radiation so you

833
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:59,720
replace that with a with a light tube

834
00:38:57,130 --> 00:39:03,140
turn it upside down face it towards the

835
00:38:59,719 --> 00:39:05,750
earth you put it into a minus 40 degree

836
00:39:03,139 --> 00:39:09,170
box of somebody's that didn't turn

837
00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:10,849
around but anyways so we have to turn

838
00:39:09,170 --> 00:39:14,930
the helicopter around I guess so anyway

839
00:39:10,849 --> 00:39:28,329
so now name it down then you come in

840
00:39:14,929 --> 00:39:31,429
with helicopter comes in and now fly off

841
00:39:28,329 --> 00:39:33,980
so I think this is experiment we need to

842
00:39:31,429 --> 00:39:37,909
do so we know exactly where that

843
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:40,909
absorption takes place that this was in

844
00:39:37,909 --> 00:39:43,730
case the previous slide didn't work okay

845
00:39:40,909 --> 00:39:46,399
so let's say we put need to know here

846
00:39:43,730 --> 00:39:48,710
and here and at what point does the

847
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:50,960
absorption go to nearly nearly to zero

848
00:39:48,710 --> 00:39:56,110
that's a really critical measurement

849
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:56,110
that we don't have that goes up

850
00:39:56,369 --> 00:40:03,400
okay so I just want to give you some

851
00:40:00,358 --> 00:40:05,528
perspective of the historical record

852
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:08,680
that we have so here we have high levels

853
00:40:05,528 --> 00:40:09,909
of co2 gradually coming down then we

854
00:40:08,679 --> 00:40:13,419
have the temperature of the earth so

855
00:40:09,909 --> 00:40:18,429
here the oceans froze over warmed up and

856
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:19,989
right now we're over here okay so we so

857
00:40:18,429 --> 00:40:21,489
we are still in the Ice Age now this is

858
00:40:19,989 --> 00:40:24,519
the same thing but it's on a log scale

859
00:40:21,489 --> 00:40:26,349
so it amplifies the recent history so

860
00:40:24,518 --> 00:40:29,409
you can see recently we've had climate

861
00:40:26,349 --> 00:40:31,599
change going on for a long time now it's

862
00:40:29,409 --> 00:40:32,649
trending up but look what the trends

863
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:34,150
have been before

864
00:40:32,650 --> 00:40:35,829
I mean climate change is something

865
00:40:34,150 --> 00:40:37,719
that's been going on for millions of

866
00:40:35,829 --> 00:40:40,119
years and there's I don't think there's

867
00:40:37,719 --> 00:40:41,739
any reason to expect that this is always

868
00:40:40,119 --> 00:40:45,789
going to be the new norm or what we're

869
00:40:41,739 --> 00:40:48,548
experiencing today so climate change

870
00:40:45,789 --> 00:40:50,469
gives us a real challenge for growing

871
00:40:48,548 --> 00:40:57,849
more food because it makes it harder it

872
00:40:50,469 --> 00:41:00,429
does make it harder to grow food so this

873
00:40:57,849 --> 00:41:03,130
is why I think adaptation becomes so

874
00:41:00,429 --> 00:41:05,679
important that's why I'm so enthusiastic

875
00:41:03,130 --> 00:41:07,239
about the soil health program because if

876
00:41:05,679 --> 00:41:08,858
you don't take good care of the soil you

877
00:41:07,239 --> 00:41:11,739
lose it you're not going to be able to

878
00:41:08,858 --> 00:41:13,568
grow crops when you have issues with

879
00:41:11,739 --> 00:41:15,278
climate change you have too much water

880
00:41:13,568 --> 00:41:18,159
or too little it's going to be hard to

881
00:41:15,278 --> 00:41:20,440
grow food so here's a no-till farm it's

882
00:41:18,159 --> 00:41:22,989
much better practice it absorbs water

883
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:24,789
through the soil it stores water in the

884
00:41:22,989 --> 00:41:29,429
groundwater the soil doesn't run off and

885
00:41:24,789 --> 00:41:33,400
you can grow more food we need to use

886
00:41:29,429 --> 00:41:35,308
molecular biology to grow aluminum

887
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:37,930
tolerant plants that can withstand

888
00:41:35,309 --> 00:41:41,650
weathering in various conditions so we

889
00:41:37,929 --> 00:41:43,808
can grow food in more arid lands we need

890
00:41:41,650 --> 00:41:45,759
to use green house operations the

891
00:41:43,809 --> 00:41:47,950
tomatoes from back there came from this

892
00:41:45,759 --> 00:41:50,798
green and from our greenhouse operation

893
00:41:47,949 --> 00:41:52,358
but I learned in using a controlled

894
00:41:50,798 --> 00:41:54,869
environment and agriculture you can

895
00:41:52,358 --> 00:41:58,478
actually go very good tasting tomatoes

896
00:41:54,869 --> 00:41:59,890
because I don't because I can isolate it

897
00:41:58,478 --> 00:42:02,618
from the environment I can control

898
00:41:59,889 --> 00:42:04,150
disease without using pesticides or

899
00:42:02,619 --> 00:42:08,800
fungicides or herbicides or any

900
00:42:04,150 --> 00:42:10,780
chemicals you start them in January and

901
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:13,090
they outgrow the disease and so I don't

902
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:15,460
need to grow the genetically modified

903
00:42:13,090 --> 00:42:16,990
tapeless tomatoes but I can actually

904
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:18,880
grow good tasting ones and sell them

905
00:42:16,989 --> 00:42:20,739
locally so I think this needs to be more

906
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:23,079
advanced so here's my daughter and a

907
00:42:20,739 --> 00:42:25,989
friend they're planting seeds and pots

908
00:42:23,079 --> 00:42:34,029
in the greenhouse um I want see if this

909
00:42:25,989 --> 00:42:49,479
will play back this is kind of nice and

910
00:42:34,030 --> 00:42:51,940
what a farmer is so misses the end of

911
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:55,000
the slide and I hope this is the future

912
00:42:51,940 --> 00:43:03,150
generation of Agriculture so take any

913
00:42:55,000 --> 00:43:03,150
questions anybody has questions yeah

914
00:43:09,449 --> 00:43:15,909
that because they have the temperature

915
00:43:12,699 --> 00:43:18,639
in the co2 concentration exact same time

916
00:43:15,909 --> 00:43:20,769
so they don't where the window is yeah

917
00:43:18,639 --> 00:43:25,569
and they know how the co2 concentration

918
00:43:20,769 --> 00:43:27,039
is changing and then we also need to

919
00:43:25,570 --> 00:43:29,590
know what it is over the oceans we need

920
00:43:27,039 --> 00:43:32,559
to know what it's over land right what

921
00:43:29,590 --> 00:43:34,180
altitude does their atmosphere absorb

922
00:43:32,559 --> 00:43:36,400
all that infrared radiation I mean

923
00:43:34,179 --> 00:43:41,279
that's the real crux of the whole

924
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:41,280
problem and I think on was it

925
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:52,239
of hemingway from where it said there's

926
00:43:49,230 --> 00:43:55,179
lies dental eyes and their statistics

927
00:43:52,239 --> 00:43:57,009
and maybe we should then extend that to

928
00:43:55,179 --> 00:43:58,690
computer modeling you know if you don't

929
00:43:57,010 --> 00:44:00,280
have the numbers right you don't

930
00:43:58,690 --> 00:44:02,858
understand your system then it becomes

931
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:05,980
hard to give an accurate prediction and

932
00:44:02,858 --> 00:44:08,170
the other questions yeah you know I

933
00:44:05,980 --> 00:44:09,820
think we have to revise a little bit

934
00:44:08,170 --> 00:44:12,190
your story of the American Declaration

935
00:44:09,820 --> 00:44:13,539
of Independence George Washington may

936
00:44:12,190 --> 00:44:15,909
have been a farmer but how many slaves

937
00:44:13,539 --> 00:44:18,190
did you guys have actually telling how

938
00:44:15,909 --> 00:44:19,539
much was he himself killing we all know

939
00:44:18,190 --> 00:44:21,280
about Jefferson he you know this

940
00:44:19,539 --> 00:44:23,980
idealism in John Adams were sitting up

941
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:26,080
there boss he was a lawyer so I don't

942
00:44:23,980 --> 00:44:28,179
quite get that and then the Declaration

943
00:44:26,079 --> 00:44:29,980
of Independence was primarily as we now

944
00:44:28,179 --> 00:44:31,929
know about because Britain was about to

945
00:44:29,980 --> 00:44:34,539
abolish slavery because the king was

946
00:44:31,929 --> 00:44:36,309
dealing with the Indians fairly Native

947
00:44:34,539 --> 00:44:38,019
Americans fairly and because he left the

948
00:44:36,309 --> 00:44:39,820
Quebecers keep their Catholic religion

949
00:44:38,019 --> 00:44:41,500
if you read in the Declaration of

950
00:44:39,820 --> 00:44:43,300
Independence the list of grievances

951
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:45,250
against the king you're going to see

952
00:44:43,300 --> 00:44:49,869
this part you put with just window

953
00:44:45,250 --> 00:45:22,929
dressing up so I think we thanks for

954
00:44:49,869 --> 00:45:37,320
bringing that up one day or one before

955
00:45:22,929 --> 00:45:37,319
we want like that but it

956
00:46:09,079 --> 00:46:17,819
where's the window with the earth is

957
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:22,559
raining so there's this rating in all

958
00:46:17,820 --> 00:46:35,430
the areas that are in white what that's

959
00:46:22,559 --> 00:46:39,858
the blackbody radiation okay so so this

960
00:46:35,429 --> 00:46:39,858
is inverted because this is looking at

961
00:46:43,460 --> 00:47:06,150
right where would he you can't do that

962
00:46:49,530 --> 00:47:11,519
here because I don't get the blackbody

963
00:47:06,150 --> 00:47:14,309
missions from right so temperature yes

964
00:47:11,519 --> 00:47:17,579
so where would that be a Medina is that

965
00:47:14,309 --> 00:47:19,920
important to keep radiation from the

966
00:47:17,579 --> 00:47:27,509
earth yes it's not on this tag this is

967
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:29,338
an absorption spectra and this is we're

968
00:47:27,510 --> 00:47:33,000
also with the water sets and you also

969
00:47:29,338 --> 00:47:35,400
have another fart and I believe this is

970
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:37,108
at atmospheric pressure throughout the

971
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:41,430
atmosphere so it's gonna be low pressure

972
00:47:37,108 --> 00:47:43,139
to high pressure well some of its going

973
00:47:41,429 --> 00:47:45,858
to be surfaced some of its also going to

974
00:47:43,139 --> 00:47:47,789
be a result up in the upper atmosphere

975
00:47:45,858 --> 00:47:49,969
yeah it's perfect in away from the

976
00:47:47,789 --> 00:47:49,969
surface

977
00:47:55,880 --> 00:48:01,050
well the question becomes the sips does

978
00:47:58,858 --> 00:48:01,500
the co2 radiation does the radiation

979
00:48:01,050 --> 00:48:04,230
from

980
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:06,420
earth that's that co2 can't capture does

981
00:48:04,230 --> 00:48:08,449
it get that high to begin with that's

982
00:48:06,420 --> 00:48:12,300
the important question is right at the

983
00:48:08,449 --> 00:48:17,609
center point almost to right water vapor

984
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:19,560
window you do not create the other one

985
00:48:17,610 --> 00:48:21,930
thing that is enlightening is actually

986
00:48:19,559 --> 00:48:28,739
not a major emission temperature or a

987
00:48:21,929 --> 00:48:31,980
radius near surface so I think the

988
00:48:28,739 --> 00:48:37,049
launching over those details you know I

989
00:48:31,980 --> 00:48:38,429
don't have the the slide to I put in

990
00:48:37,050 --> 00:48:46,500
here it still money so I didn't have the

991
00:48:38,429 --> 00:48:51,269
slide because the peak around 44 microns

992
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:53,969
is really irrelevant it doesn't matter

993
00:48:51,269 --> 00:48:56,030
if it there's not that much heat coming

994
00:48:53,969 --> 00:48:58,289
there's not much out killing for that

995
00:48:56,030 --> 00:49:04,970
that's like what they saw the radiation

996
00:48:58,289 --> 00:49:04,969
and the radiation so the only really

997
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:20,220
weird saturating not yeah but still

998
00:49:13,469 --> 00:49:24,419
actually methane which is over there is

999
00:49:20,219 --> 00:49:27,299
irrelevant to what one thing keep in

1000
00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:29,010
mind that the energy at this end of the

1001
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:48,480
spectrum is much greater than the energy

1002
00:49:29,010 --> 00:49:52,410
at this end of the spectrum it's a very

1003
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:59,280
outdated a lot of court system trying to

1004
00:49:52,409 --> 00:50:00,989
gather funds even here I'm basically

1005
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:05,190
limited plankton being able back to the

1006
00:50:00,989 --> 00:50:08,399
Camry yeah it's true that there are coal

1007
00:50:05,190 --> 00:50:10,349
plants and past and that major did that

1008
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:14,000
occurs right at the end of the art

1009
00:50:10,349 --> 00:50:15,980
addition is well known and

1010
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:18,289
so the harmonization these are

1011
00:50:15,980 --> 00:50:20,869
well-known events to have correlated

1012
00:50:18,289 --> 00:50:24,590
especially that second one to go back to

1013
00:50:20,869 --> 00:50:29,180
the enemy earning at the end of the

1014
00:50:24,590 --> 00:50:30,950
Carboniferous so 300 years Carboniferous

1015
00:50:29,179 --> 00:50:33,469
the term differs is named for them that

1016
00:50:30,949 --> 00:50:35,929
God asked you to provide us with a plant

1017
00:50:33,469 --> 00:50:38,239
which is linked to white spread

1018
00:50:35,929 --> 00:50:39,799
radiation which actually supports the

1019
00:50:38,239 --> 00:50:42,618
hypothesis the strong correlation

1020
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:44,960
technique co2 and climate for time they

1021
00:50:42,619 --> 00:50:46,400
totally agreed unless have movie years

1022
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:48,650
we've been in nightlife climate on

1023
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:50,720
average but the numbers in terms of

1024
00:50:48,650 --> 00:50:53,329
actual temperature increased or talking

1025
00:50:50,719 --> 00:50:56,989
about during the period of dinosaurs is

1026
00:50:53,329 --> 00:51:02,559
I mean very dramatic right correlate to

1027
00:50:56,989 --> 00:51:08,409
the co2 even had a huge yes it would I

1028
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:08,409
don't yeah but it matters it co2 because

1029
00:51:08,500 --> 00:51:12,889
yeah there's something that we can do

1030
00:51:10,670 --> 00:51:16,010
about but then it all comes down this

1031
00:51:12,889 --> 00:51:17,960
one basic answer is we don't have how

1032
00:51:16,010 --> 00:51:19,970
much of it in the atmosphere do we need

1033
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:23,030
that's causing the climate change is it

1034
00:51:19,969 --> 00:51:25,879
this much or is it this much that's the

1035
00:51:23,030 --> 00:51:39,619
critical spectroscopic answer that we

1036
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:41,690
have to have made right that's what it's

1037
00:51:39,619 --> 00:51:44,150
not supported by the for ponder the net

1038
00:51:41,690 --> 00:51:55,010
is that come from different types of

1039
00:51:44,150 --> 00:51:57,650
modeling observation but how did they

1040
00:51:55,010 --> 00:51:59,690
arrive at those watts per meter squared

1041
00:51:57,650 --> 00:52:01,490
did they use the wrong assumptions from

1042
00:51:59,690 --> 00:52:04,400
the spectroscopy curves that's the

1043
00:52:01,489 --> 00:52:11,209
question I'm bringing up you can get a

1044
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:13,309
similar reconstruction of global

1045
00:52:11,210 --> 00:52:15,949
temperatures going back 700 you show the

1046
00:52:13,309 --> 00:52:18,259
curve Yoga doesn't well you use that

1047
00:52:15,949 --> 00:52:19,819
time series whatever temperature into

1048
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:22,760
volcanic eruptions you get a sensitivity

1049
00:52:19,820 --> 00:52:24,410
the radiative term to of about saying

1050
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:28,059
you know frequent flyers one seven well

1051
00:52:24,409 --> 00:52:30,288
he knows but he still radiative forcing

1052
00:52:28,059 --> 00:52:32,450
yeah either from the models like

1053
00:52:30,289 --> 00:52:34,369
excitement or it could be from the

1054
00:52:32,449 --> 00:52:36,889
climate Emmett excuse you put you into

1055
00:52:34,369 --> 00:52:39,200
that same baller you can do it from a

1056
00:52:36,889 --> 00:52:41,298
simple energy balance law so there's

1057
00:52:39,199 --> 00:52:43,098
there's multiple avenues to give us this

1058
00:52:41,298 --> 00:52:46,130
to afford a free estimate and those are

1059
00:52:43,099 --> 00:52:48,289
well know and to tipple also over that i

1060
00:52:46,130 --> 00:52:50,838
think this is not an accurate portrayal

1061
00:52:48,289 --> 00:52:53,778
in science data science because would

1062
00:52:50,838 --> 00:52:56,420
you like to do some board and your

1063
00:52:53,778 --> 00:53:07,039
vision for the for some constant which

1064
00:52:56,420 --> 00:53:09,920
one we're seeing articles here that

1065
00:53:07,039 --> 00:53:12,099
people are welcome to read I have copies

1066
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:15,639
of them they want to go through some

1067
00:53:12,099 --> 00:53:15,640
look at it from both sides

1068
00:53:20,139 --> 00:53:28,778
this has been a production of Cornell

1069
