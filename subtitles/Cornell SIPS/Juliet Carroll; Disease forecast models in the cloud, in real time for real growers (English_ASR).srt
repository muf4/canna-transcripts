1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:05,119
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:05,120
University

3
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:14,919
thank you all for coming and I hope that

4
00:00:11,949 --> 00:00:16,809
when you leave after the seminar will

5
00:00:14,919 --> 00:00:20,528
know everything you wanted to know about

6
00:00:16,809 --> 00:00:22,719
Noah and you'll be charged to build

7
00:00:20,528 --> 00:00:26,079
models and tools for growers at

8
00:00:22,719 --> 00:00:28,289
communities etc that use whether to tell

9
00:00:26,079 --> 00:00:31,719
them what they should be doing

10
00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:34,060
so what is new I Noah is a crowdsourced

11
00:00:31,719 --> 00:00:36,250
network both I guess I'm a starting like

12
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:39,399
two migrants we don't keep you guys too

13
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:42,179
awfully long isn't that isn't that

14
00:00:39,399 --> 00:00:46,230
terrible i started a stopwatch instead

15
00:00:42,179 --> 00:00:46,229
okay here we go all right

16
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:54,680
I'm canceling that and I'm going to use

17
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:57,869
the ancient technology

18
00:00:54,679 --> 00:00:59,820
the place is not a solar you know one of

19
00:00:57,869 --> 00:01:01,559
those things we need to be out the Sun

20
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:05,040
so I will see where the shade was

21
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:07,379
getting so Noah is a crowdsourced

22
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,850
Network weather station owners are

23
00:01:07,379 --> 00:01:11,280
sharing their data through the network

24
00:01:08,849 --> 00:01:13,199
and providing us with feedback and

25
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,540
guidance on how we can improve the

26
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,609
network and how we can grow the weather

27
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:20,070
data currently is collected every 15

28
00:01:17,609 --> 00:01:23,039
minutes and it is tabulated and hourly

29
00:01:20,069 --> 00:01:25,469
and daily summaries we're collecting

30
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:28,560
precipitation temperature relative

31
00:01:25,469 --> 00:01:32,340
humidity leaf wetness solar radiation

32
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:34,439
wind speed and wind direction and the

33
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:38,210
weather stations of the network have now

34
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:41,039
optionals soil temperature and moisture

35
00:01:38,209 --> 00:01:42,618
sensors available that the grower can

36
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,450
installed

37
00:01:42,618 --> 00:01:47,790
we designate sister stations in the

38
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:49,320
network so that we can avoid having gaps

39
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:52,320
in the data if you're accumulating

40
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:54,599
degree days over the year and you have

41
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:57,049
gaps in your data your day denies

42
00:01:54,599 --> 00:01:59,750
garbage you're not going to have

43
00:01:57,049 --> 00:02:01,929
of degree days so it's really important

44
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:05,120
not to have missing data

45
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:07,340
so basically all this data is used to

46
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:09,340
build decision support tools for I p.m.

47
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:11,360
and crop production and

48
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:14,090
that's what I'll be talking about today

49
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,800
a little bit more boring history stuff

50
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:18,979
for you be pouring it into the meat of

51
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:20,990
the talk know what was created in 1996

52
00:02:18,979 --> 00:02:23,329
by Curt pestle to them at the time was

53
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:25,969
the vegetable IPM coordinator with the

54
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:27,040
new york state IPM program he had got

55
00:02:25,969 --> 00:02:29,960
who believe it or not in

56
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:33,799
telecommunications grant so we set up

57
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:37,010
phone lines and Moto's all across New

58
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:41,330
York to gather weather data yeah right

59
00:02:37,009 --> 00:02:43,759
what's a phone this is a phone so

60
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:46,730
initially was an association with

61
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:50,449
membership levels today it's open access

62
00:02:46,729 --> 00:02:53,179
and we have land greg and grower member

63
00:02:50,449 --> 00:02:55,009
support we started out with campbell

64
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:58,370
instruments that sensor instruments

65
00:02:55,009 --> 00:03:00,870
sensotronic box sensor became obsolete

66
00:02:58,370 --> 00:03:02,938
today we use primarily rain wise

67
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:06,650
incorporated weather stations although

68
00:03:02,938 --> 00:03:09,469
we can just data from onset instruments

69
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:12,750
airports and state residents

70
00:03:09,469 --> 00:03:15,239
so why are you talking about the manual

71
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:17,329
download yep we used to go out with the

72
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:21,719
computer a laptop

73
00:03:17,329 --> 00:03:24,989
computer and download we fax the data

74
00:03:21,719 --> 00:03:27,030
out messages were created and posted on

75
00:03:24,989 --> 00:03:30,299
Kota phones and the growers can call

76
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:32,219
those clothes and get that message as to

77
00:03:30,299 --> 00:03:36,260
what the prediction was for the

78
00:03:32,219 --> 00:03:40,019
particular day or week or

79
00:03:36,259 --> 00:03:43,378
today we have 428 weather station

80
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:46,230
locations in 23 states that are ingested

81
00:03:43,378 --> 00:03:48,298
into nua we have 10 member states plus

82
00:03:46,229 --> 00:03:52,078
individual members and five other states

83
00:03:48,299 --> 00:03:56,790
I gave a seminar on you all month ago

84
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:58,750
and there 415 weather stations so 13

85
00:03:56,789 --> 00:04:02,229
more just

86
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:04,240
this is a whole new a homepage I don't

87
00:04:02,229 --> 00:04:06,719
expect you to be able to read this but I

88
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:11,490
just wanted to point out some things

89
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:11,490
this is not the culture

90
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:18,780
the pointer is not working i'm going to

91
00:04:15,449 --> 00:04:21,839
use the cursor okay so this is the

92
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:25,339
website formula this blue menu up here

93
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:27,929
follows you through out the website

94
00:04:25,339 --> 00:04:31,969
giving you access to weather data has

95
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:34,620
forecasts crop management info etc and

96
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:36,600
up here I kind of like this this is a

97
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:38,970
little National Weather Service very box

98
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:41,070
so you can enter your city state here

99
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:42,720
press go and find out what the weather

100
00:04:41,069 --> 00:04:46,560
forecast is from the National Weather

101
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:51,080
Service and now given where we are with

102
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:55,168
the internet the map saves your location

103
00:04:51,079 --> 00:04:58,259
it knows where you are so that can be

104
00:04:55,168 --> 00:05:01,680
really creepy for some of us who are old

105
00:04:58,259 --> 00:05:03,689
school but it's exciting for those of

106
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:06,990
you like using the web and having it

107
00:05:03,689 --> 00:05:11,300
seamlessly remember where you are so

108
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:13,430
that is not advance the slide

109
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:17,590
this is

110
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:17,590
so the newest station pages

111
00:05:18,009 --> 00:05:24,740
all right the newest station pages look

112
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:27,800
like this so this is the ash with

113
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:30,949
weather station page it provides quick

114
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:34,009
links to pest forecasts here some

115
00:05:30,949 --> 00:05:36,500
weather products here click click links

116
00:05:34,009 --> 00:05:38,089
this actually has been upgraded you know

117
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:39,560
a lot of these strange Jones do you go

118
00:05:38,089 --> 00:05:41,599
now they're not going to be exactly the

119
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:43,730
same because as with any web technology

120
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:46,250
or change it all the time and updating

121
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:50,210
it all the time so you can access

122
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:51,800
location specific data here this happens

123
00:05:50,209 --> 00:05:54,139
to be a weather station that you want to

124
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:56,389
an apple grower and typically the apple

125
00:05:54,139 --> 00:06:00,639
growers will link you know the bookmark

126
00:05:56,389 --> 00:06:04,930
this page so that they can get to easily

127
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:08,180
this is the new a map the

128
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:11,879
states that are colored purple our

129
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:14,340
number states they piano those that are

130
00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:17,069
orange have just individual growers that

131
00:06:14,339 --> 00:06:20,909
are plugged into new up that are paying

132
00:06:17,069 --> 00:06:24,689
a small Murphy and then the larger

133
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:27,270
google map shows the icons that are the

134
00:06:24,689 --> 00:06:30,860
new up stations and then the National

135
00:06:27,269 --> 00:06:34,198
Weather Service airport locations

136
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:36,350
so how does new a benefit the program's

137
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:38,540
of plant apology

138
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:40,460
ecology well certainly plan to these

139
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:43,160
forecast models can be developed into

140
00:06:40,459 --> 00:06:46,039
tools to inform management decisions I

141
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:49,840
cam is all about reducing the pesticide

142
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:52,790
footprint in crops and

143
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:55,250
you'll see as I get through this talk

144
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:57,650
how much of an impact this system has on

145
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:59,569
that weather data can be used to

146
00:06:57,649 --> 00:07:02,359
validate and implement plant disease

147
00:06:59,569 --> 00:07:03,800
epidemiology models or potentially some

148
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:06,590
research that you're doing on a plant

149
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:08,389
disease epidemic in addition data and

150
00:07:06,589 --> 00:07:10,789
new it can be used for power system

151
00:07:08,389 --> 00:07:12,589
research and development so you're just

152
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:14,870
doing some research on the field of its

153
00:07:12,589 --> 00:07:17,839
weather station close by you can

154
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:21,620
correlate some of those weather events

155
00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:24,399
to disease development so I'm here today

156
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:24,399
I'm giving

157
00:07:25,399 --> 00:07:34,448
I'm kidding try to find myself I'm

158
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:34,449
giving this talk for the third time

159
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:39,189
this

160
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:40,660
to stimulate thinking about developing a

161
00:07:39,189 --> 00:07:43,029
utilizing new ID to benefit

162
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:44,710
counterculture and communities and to

163
00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:46,599
raise awareness of what Noah has to

164
00:07:44,709 --> 00:07:49,719
offer some of you have the dubious

165
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:51,340
distinction that one of having seen my

166
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:54,010
seminar that I gave her soil and crop

167
00:07:51,339 --> 00:07:56,560
Sciences I gave us the Vanara for

168
00:07:54,009 --> 00:07:59,139
entomology last month and next month

169
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,819
should you choose to see what we have to

170
00:07:59,139 --> 00:08:02,909
offer for horticulture all beginning

171
00:08:00,819 --> 00:08:07,240
this

172
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:10,120
ok now I have a plethora of devices here

173
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:12,040
all right so now we're going to go

174
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:14,310
through some of these predictive tools

175
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:17,980
they fall into basically three

176
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:20,680
categories crop management tools weather

177
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:23,319
products and pests forecast tools all

178
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:27,040
these tools are in real time their query

179
00:08:23,319 --> 00:08:28,899
based decision support they have some of

180
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:30,730
them have built in bio fixes the

181
00:08:28,899 --> 00:08:35,259
bioethics could be first trap catch

182
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:38,649
state common law for Kali ma manage

183
00:08:35,259 --> 00:08:40,439
torture it could be emergence date for

184
00:08:38,649 --> 00:08:43,090
potatoes for

185
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:45,280
understanding went to strengthen

186
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:47,190
lamplighter growth like to know when

187
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:48,899
that promise emerging I

188
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:51,600
don't think

189
00:08:48,899 --> 00:08:53,600
my lips than that work and they all have

190
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:56,009
an interactive user interface

191
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:58,310
so the crop management tools I'm not

192
00:08:56,009 --> 00:09:01,529
going to dwell on here but primarily

193
00:08:58,309 --> 00:09:03,569
they are this is the drop-down list on

194
00:09:01,529 --> 00:09:06,350
new up for these and again this changes

195
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:09,290
depending on what we've got to offer

196
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:11,970
but primarily crop load management

197
00:09:09,289 --> 00:09:14,129
irrigation and freeze risks are the

198
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:17,840
three key areas that people are

199
00:09:14,129 --> 00:09:22,230
interested in utilizing litter dia or

200
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:24,019
whether primes so we have again it's the

201
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:26,909
drop-down list from the website we have

202
00:09:24,019 --> 00:09:28,919
all these degree days for these base

203
00:09:26,909 --> 00:09:31,110
temperatures these are based on the

204
00:09:28,919 --> 00:09:32,939
models that we currently have so for

205
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:36,060
already calculating the base temperature

206
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:39,390
we just basically use that and calculate

207
00:09:36,059 --> 00:09:41,759
that and show the tabulated degree days

208
00:09:39,389 --> 00:09:43,980
for that base temperature and they're

209
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:47,490
tabulated starting from four different

210
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:51,029
dates gender in 10 days calendar day

211
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:54,659
march one al gore's like that April 1

212
00:09:51,029 --> 00:09:57,839
and a 1 I think April one grape growers

213
00:09:54,659 --> 00:09:59,990
like that so we have hourly data tables

214
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:02,990
dig Lisa tables and a degree in

215
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:05,509
calculator which we just resurrected

216
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:07,399
this year so I have to share this with

217
00:10:05,509 --> 00:10:10,009
you I'm really excited about getting

218
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:12,919
this back online it went offline when

219
00:10:10,009 --> 00:10:15,009
you migrate into a new website so

220
00:10:12,919 --> 00:10:17,750
basically to select the degree day type

221
00:10:15,009 --> 00:10:19,939
accumulation start date and a picnic

222
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:21,830
report obviously you need to select the

223
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:25,430
state and the weather station location

224
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:28,400
and the results show up here this graph

225
00:10:25,429 --> 00:10:30,500
is it rich initially hidden but you can

226
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:33,470
get button and it pops open and if you

227
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:35,929
scroll along there's a little pop-up box

228
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:38,910
that tells you essentially the point at

229
00:10:35,929 --> 00:10:41,969
which you're working it's a forecast of

230
00:10:38,909 --> 00:10:43,949
five days past two days and the current

231
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:48,210
so this is the degree in accumulation

232
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:52,720
today oh yeah got cold in September is

233
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:54,290
warm this week yes goa climate warming

234
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:57,029
[Music]

235
00:10:54,289 --> 00:10:58,459
and then there obviously is a seasonal

236
00:10:57,029 --> 00:11:00,929
accumulation

237
00:10:58,460 --> 00:11:03,420
so this i'm going to show you because

238
00:11:00,929 --> 00:11:06,000
this is what growers can use these are

239
00:11:03,419 --> 00:11:08,189
the hourly and daily data summaries and

240
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,889
this basically is showing what we're now

241
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:15,260
calling a Valentine's Day Massacre so

242
00:11:10,889 --> 00:11:19,830
last winter was really mild right

243
00:11:15,259 --> 00:11:22,889
mild but then what happened was around

244
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:26,490
Valentine's Day the temperature limited

245
00:11:22,889 --> 00:11:31,110
and you can see it got as low as minus

246
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:34,289
10 here and then this is a daily data

247
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:38,220
summary so you can see here's the 14 and

248
00:11:34,289 --> 00:11:40,528
the 15th so that's why the sweet cherry

249
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:42,839
crop was pretty much toast in New York

250
00:11:40,528 --> 00:11:47,659
learning peaches to speak of apricots

251
00:11:42,839 --> 00:11:47,660
were toast so those of you who are fans

252
00:11:48,409 --> 00:11:52,600
was a real power because we really

253
00:11:51,059 --> 00:11:54,489
didn't happen

254
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:55,899
so now I'm going to talk about the

255
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:57,759
things that are near and dear to our

256
00:11:55,899 --> 00:12:01,149
hearts and these are the past what has

257
00:11:57,759 --> 00:12:04,120
tools for plant diseases and I found out

258
00:12:01,149 --> 00:12:06,028
yesterday that we have two more plant

259
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:12,509
disease tools than I thought because

260
00:12:06,028 --> 00:12:14,669
well good so i used to say 14 by got 60

261
00:12:12,509 --> 00:12:16,439
yesterday

262
00:12:14,669 --> 00:12:19,019
so I'm going to walk through the apple

263
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:23,750
scab model I'm a fruit person and so

264
00:12:19,019 --> 00:12:26,639
most of what I know about is fruit so

265
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:29,129
essentially what you're going to do is a

266
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:31,319
mention with the degree date calculator

267
00:12:29,129 --> 00:12:34,320
you're going to select a disease on

268
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:37,620
apple disease models a state this

269
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:41,879
screenshot happens to be before we put

270
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:44,159
the state drop down in this school you'd

271
00:12:41,879 --> 00:12:46,830
select a weather station this happened

272
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:50,699
to be in if so now is giving a talk in

273
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:54,389
Minnesota and the date of interest April

274
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:56,850
29 and you get calculated initially this

275
00:12:54,389 --> 00:12:58,340
map town is showing and it has a google

276
00:12:56,850 --> 00:13:00,990
map and

277
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:03,750
wants you to calculate with the little

278
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:07,409
dots of wheels filming and the results

279
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:10,379
show up so at the top you can see

280
00:13:07,409 --> 00:13:13,919
there's a great update we are estimating

281
00:13:10,379 --> 00:13:17,789
this green tip date and it's mcintosh me

282
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:20,468
to date from over 20 years of historical

283
00:13:17,789 --> 00:13:23,198
observations agricultural experiment

284
00:13:20,469 --> 00:13:27,159
station in Geneva so we've been looking

285
00:13:23,198 --> 00:13:30,008
at apple phenology an insect data for

286
00:13:27,158 --> 00:13:32,198
years and years of there so we can SN we

287
00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:35,558
also had weather data so we can estimate

288
00:13:32,198 --> 00:13:37,958
that green tip date or you can overwrite

289
00:13:35,558 --> 00:13:40,769
it so you can enter your fifty percent

290
00:13:37,958 --> 00:13:45,718
free tip of Macintosh date

291
00:13:40,769 --> 00:13:48,308
here and the model will recalculate so

292
00:13:45,719 --> 00:13:51,999
initially at the top there the S is for

293
00:13:48,308 --> 00:13:54,038
maturity summary ascospores overwinter

294
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:58,209
in the leaf litter in the orchard and

295
00:13:54,038 --> 00:14:00,668
they mature in the spring and we need at

296
00:13:58,208 --> 00:14:01,918
least eleven to twelve percent mature

297
00:14:00,668 --> 00:14:05,078
aside

298
00:14:01,918 --> 00:14:07,658
for score ejection to likely to be

299
00:14:05,078 --> 00:14:09,519
likely to occur so we know that you know

300
00:14:07,658 --> 00:14:12,369
this from a lot of work has been done on

301
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:14,999
Apple's down here you can see the apple

302
00:14:12,369 --> 00:14:19,298
scab ask us for maturity

303
00:14:14,999 --> 00:14:19,298
model is showing what

304
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:24,850
is for this time frame again to pass

305
00:14:23,019 --> 00:14:28,690
dates of birth date and the five-day

306
00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:31,000
forecast here so it looks like oh yeah

307
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:33,430
we're going to be you know during the

308
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,528
apple scab season here goes you can

309
00:14:33,429 --> 00:14:38,620
click on this and it will show you the

310
00:14:35,528 --> 00:14:40,919
apple ask us for maturity chart so

311
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:43,929
here's the chart for us was for maturity

312
00:14:40,919 --> 00:14:47,139
obviously if it was april one it

313
00:14:43,929 --> 00:14:49,409
wouldn't show all of this and just show

314
00:14:47,139 --> 00:14:53,329
a portion of it

315
00:14:49,409 --> 00:14:56,328
but this sorry

316
00:14:53,328 --> 00:14:56,328
so

317
00:14:59,039 --> 00:15:05,669
confuse everybody so this was the date

318
00:15:01,679 --> 00:15:07,679
of interest was April 29 and so this is

319
00:15:05,669 --> 00:15:12,588
the ask us for maturity chart or that

320
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:16,679
date and down here this shows the

321
00:15:12,589 --> 00:15:19,290
temperature in blue the precip in green

322
00:15:16,679 --> 00:15:23,088
and then the forecast data is in a

323
00:15:19,289 --> 00:15:23,088
different color brown yellow

324
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:29,429
below the S is for maturity chart are

325
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:31,769
the apple scab effectual notes these are

326
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:33,809
calculated based on rainfall and

327
00:15:31,769 --> 00:15:35,778
temperature during that rain or leaf

328
00:15:33,809 --> 00:15:38,838
wedding event and

329
00:15:35,778 --> 00:15:43,200
basically the charts can be green or red

330
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:46,290
depending on whether there is an event I

331
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:48,810
was accessing this historically and

332
00:15:46,289 --> 00:15:50,909
that's why the days to symptoms haven't

333
00:15:48,809 --> 00:15:53,579
calculated here because the forecast

334
00:15:50,909 --> 00:15:55,949
details at that point in time were being

335
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:59,160
saved and they couldn't populate this

336
00:15:55,950 --> 00:16:01,740
chart but below the management

337
00:15:59,159 --> 00:16:06,028
information is below here and it's

338
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:08,610
included here and you can click here for

339
00:16:06,028 --> 00:16:12,088
a pesticide selection tool that is

340
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:14,580
housed on another website and as the

341
00:16:12,089 --> 00:16:15,980
growing season progresses this will

342
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:18,629
change and

343
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:21,870
the model goes dormant from October

344
00:16:18,629 --> 00:16:24,870
first to march first if this says a

345
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:27,549
combined event up here you can click

346
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:31,060
down here at the office can infection

347
00:16:27,549 --> 00:16:34,899
and you'll get the details of what went

348
00:16:31,059 --> 00:16:37,689
into deciding to combine two web events

349
00:16:34,899 --> 00:16:41,080
into a single wedding event to determine

350
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:43,410
infection risk and this is basically the

351
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:47,400
leaf wetness events log

352
00:16:43,409 --> 00:16:50,559
2015 was a really here

353
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:52,220
obviously in the soda as well as here in

354
00:16:50,559 --> 00:16:54,539
New York

355
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:57,420
next I'm going to share that fire blight

356
00:16:54,539 --> 00:17:00,089
model fire blight risk I think probably

357
00:16:57,419 --> 00:17:03,599
this model the apple scab model are the

358
00:17:00,090 --> 00:17:06,509
two top use models by a low Brewers fire

359
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:09,150
blight is a bacterial disease that can

360
00:17:06,509 --> 00:17:12,209
kill trees out right it kills limbs

361
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:14,970
adventures the blossoms the model is

362
00:17:12,209 --> 00:17:17,640
modeling Blossom white as opposed to

363
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:19,860
shoot white so we want to know when the

364
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:22,380
first loss of open date is again

365
00:17:19,859 --> 00:17:25,078
historically calculated or you can enter

366
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:26,730
it yourself and then you can say what

367
00:17:25,078 --> 00:17:29,909
the white history is in your orchard

368
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:31,950
here this model is based on the cover

369
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:34,730
white bottle from Washington State

370
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:34,730
University

371
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:40,320
when you hit calculate these are the

372
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:42,150
results that you'll get so you can see

373
00:17:40,319 --> 00:17:44,099
for the date slideshows there was low

374
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:47,160
risk in the past but currently there's

375
00:17:44,099 --> 00:17:49,740
high risk going into the future but then

376
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:52,400
is getting cooler again and the risk

377
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:52,400
drops off

378
00:17:53,509 --> 00:17:58,879
this information defines the risk levels

379
00:17:56,539 --> 00:18:02,299
and then there's more to this model

380
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:04,310
below and essentially what you can do is

381
00:18:02,299 --> 00:18:06,319
you can enter the date that you apply

382
00:18:04,309 --> 00:18:09,319
streptomycin which is an antibiotic

383
00:18:06,319 --> 00:18:10,450
registered for use against fire blight

384
00:18:09,319 --> 00:18:14,299
and

385
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:17,330
once you enter that date you will

386
00:18:14,299 --> 00:18:20,089
recalculate the risk so if i apply strap

387
00:18:17,329 --> 00:18:24,189
on day 11 you can see that the dress is

388
00:18:20,089 --> 00:18:26,199
wrong now too much lower

389
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:28,058
so the rest of these I'm just going to

390
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:30,730
give you some screenshots of the rest of

391
00:18:28,058 --> 00:18:33,869
these models that we have on nua we have

392
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:36,970
a great disease infection events well

393
00:18:33,869 --> 00:18:40,449
four full boxes powdery mildew and

394
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:43,000
blackrock there's also a downy mildew

395
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:45,308
simulation model built by years of

396
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:48,849
research by dr. Pearson Bob seaman

397
00:18:45,308 --> 00:18:51,220
category of benjamina it's called DM

398
00:18:48,849 --> 00:18:52,798
cast I don't have a straight shot of

399
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:55,360
that

400
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:57,339
but there's that model as well so you

401
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:59,229
can see in the past there really was no

402
00:18:57,339 --> 00:19:03,668
risk but it looks like in the future

403
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:05,110
forecast things could get dicey and if

404
00:19:03,669 --> 00:19:08,230
there's disease management information

405
00:19:05,109 --> 00:19:09,869
down here and the page obviously is

406
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:12,519
longer than that

407
00:19:09,869 --> 00:19:15,158
the tomato disease forecast which was

408
00:19:12,519 --> 00:19:18,788
just recently realized by a bee Cena who

409
00:19:15,159 --> 00:19:22,300
specialize in coordinator is shown here

410
00:19:18,788 --> 00:19:26,019
so this is a screenshot here you can see

411
00:19:22,299 --> 00:19:28,240
on this side as I mentioned before get

412
00:19:26,019 --> 00:19:30,849
report and then this is the report that

413
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:32,650
shows up so this is where we got the two

414
00:19:30,849 --> 00:19:35,369
additional diseases because they didn't

415
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:38,590
realize Tom cast was also being used to

416
00:19:35,369 --> 00:19:40,299
predict septoria blight and anthracnose

417
00:19:38,589 --> 00:19:43,000
some tomatoes so that was kind of

418
00:19:40,299 --> 00:19:46,119
exciting so this shows the results for

419
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:48,549
Tom cast as well as late like sim cast

420
00:19:46,119 --> 00:19:50,559
and then there's a key giving

421
00:19:48,549 --> 00:19:53,559
information about what these things to

422
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:55,929
me there's also a late blight app that

423
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:59,200
the prize program developed called white

424
00:19:55,930 --> 00:20:01,570
road ESS ESS downstairs for decision

425
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:03,610
support system and there's a link to

426
00:20:01,569 --> 00:20:05,789
that on newest thing you want to

427
00:20:03,609 --> 00:20:09,039
download that

428
00:20:05,789 --> 00:20:10,869
the potato disease forecast very similar

429
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:12,639
except the early blight bottle is

430
00:20:10,869 --> 00:20:15,519
different it's captivating few days

431
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:19,640
here's the pide key and then here's the

432
00:20:15,519 --> 00:20:22,680
league life like passive severity

433
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:24,960
onion disease model was recently revised

434
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:28,080
these were all separate now they're all

435
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:30,180
on one page so we've got the botrytis

436
00:20:28,079 --> 00:20:32,789
week right model down a mildew and

437
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:37,700
purple watch here as well as the keys

438
00:20:32,789 --> 00:20:37,700
that tell you what all of this means

439
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:45,009
so what is new and how is it growing no

440
00:20:42,430 --> 00:20:46,019
to talk about sort of the inner workings

441
00:20:45,009 --> 00:20:48,549
of Noah

442
00:20:46,019 --> 00:20:50,430
we started partnering with Northeast

443
00:20:48,549 --> 00:20:52,200
Regional Climate Center in

444
00:20:50,430 --> 00:20:55,870
only

445
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:58,150
2007-2009 and they now how's our planet

446
00:20:55,869 --> 00:21:00,729
database they help us to model

447
00:20:58,150 --> 00:21:03,640
programming into the p.i design tools

448
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:06,160
that I just gave you some snapshots of

449
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:08,410
they help us with data quality control

450
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:10,120
provide the urological expertise and

451
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:12,460
guidance and the nice thing is that

452
00:21:10,119 --> 00:21:15,879
they're interested in agricultural

453
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:18,340
applications for climate data and they

454
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:21,090
helped us develop automated reports so

455
00:21:18,339 --> 00:21:25,119
that if a weather station is reporting

456
00:21:21,089 --> 00:21:27,879
an automated message goes to that owner

457
00:21:25,119 --> 00:21:30,429
and they know that that their weather

458
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:33,640
station is reporting and that has been

459
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:35,430
really well received I was surprised I

460
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:38,940
thought he would be kind of ticked off

461
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:41,500
but quite the opposite actually

462
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:43,240
this is an example of one of the tools

463
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:45,759
that the Northeast Regional climates

464
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:48,370
that are themselves create this is

465
00:21:45,759 --> 00:21:51,220
stewards wilt disease for horn and this

466
00:21:48,369 --> 00:21:52,989
shows the risk of the bacteria having

467
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:54,789
overwintered in the flea beetle that

468
00:21:52,990 --> 00:21:56,710
vectors the disease so if the

469
00:21:54,789 --> 00:22:01,119
temperatures in the winter are really

470
00:21:56,710 --> 00:22:04,490
really old that the bacterium is killed

471
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:06,829
so they've come back and then there are

472
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:10,700
also some tools that they have on their

473
00:22:06,829 --> 00:22:14,149
site so we link to their tools and they

474
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:17,269
also linked to us and we have cross

475
00:22:14,150 --> 00:22:19,370
linkage thing going on so here's a shot

476
00:22:17,269 --> 00:22:22,160
of what the weather station looks like

477
00:22:19,369 --> 00:22:24,500
this complete with cables software

478
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:27,890
everything is a little under two

479
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:29,839
thousand dollars and this is the page on

480
00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:32,120
the new website that tells the brewer

481
00:22:29,839 --> 00:22:35,149
how I of weather instrument and get it

482
00:22:32,119 --> 00:22:36,859
connected in we also have done some work

483
00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:39,769
on maintenance and troubleshooting guide

484
00:22:36,859 --> 00:22:42,259
lines one thing I will point out is that

485
00:22:39,769 --> 00:22:44,240
these are no longer configured with the

486
00:22:42,259 --> 00:22:47,298
week window sensor on the south side

487
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:49,339
these are all solar power so this week

488
00:22:47,298 --> 00:22:54,440
wetness sensor is now attached to the

489
00:22:49,339 --> 00:22:57,058
rain bucket on the north side

490
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:59,369
rain boys has helped us with file

491
00:22:57,058 --> 00:23:02,489
transfer protocol software to get our

492
00:22:59,368 --> 00:23:04,108
data into our database they now most of

493
00:23:02,489 --> 00:23:06,119
our stations are connected with what

494
00:23:04,108 --> 00:23:08,220
they call me ip100 so it is

495
00:23:06,118 --> 00:23:10,470
automatically being to be in the

496
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:12,659
internet to their website brain-wise net

497
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:14,569
and then we scrape the data off their

498
00:23:12,659 --> 00:23:17,729
website into our system

499
00:23:14,569 --> 00:23:19,499
this fall were developing an API so that

500
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:23,489
we can it started just in one minute

501
00:23:19,499 --> 00:23:25,379
kata growers 11 data rain Wise Ones to

502
00:23:23,489 --> 00:23:27,869
deliver one minute date on why because

503
00:23:25,378 --> 00:23:29,519
they have some tools and products the

504
00:23:27,868 --> 00:23:31,678
day themselves have developed frost

505
00:23:29,519 --> 00:23:35,069
alarms and things like that that they

506
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:36,499
would like to be able to market to their

507
00:23:35,069 --> 00:23:38,970
hotel

508
00:23:36,499 --> 00:23:41,899
and they also helped us develop

509
00:23:38,970 --> 00:23:44,970
different products

510
00:23:41,898 --> 00:23:48,058
so this is the exciting thing weather

511
00:23:44,970 --> 00:23:51,120
station numbers have really grown I

512
00:23:48,058 --> 00:23:53,460
became made of wool in 2005 and got a

513
00:23:51,119 --> 00:23:55,199
few grants to just donnelly increase the

514
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:58,169
network into eastern New York it was

515
00:23:55,200 --> 00:24:01,399
primarily rich in the central New York

516
00:23:58,169 --> 00:24:05,220
area and then

517
00:24:01,398 --> 00:24:07,109
things got really popular and people

518
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:11,130
started buying and installing the

519
00:24:07,109 --> 00:24:12,928
instruments in New York as of 2016 we

520
00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:16,620
have all of these states that are full

521
00:24:12,929 --> 00:24:19,679
state members this green mark here is

522
00:24:16,619 --> 00:24:22,229
New Jersey because when Jersey the state

523
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:24,690
primatology office joint and wrote

524
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:27,120
programming to deliver their entire

525
00:24:24,690 --> 00:24:30,240
oncology those event of data into our

526
00:24:27,119 --> 00:24:33,809
system which was really fantastic he

527
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:36,299
grew by almost 40 rivers to us

528
00:24:33,809 --> 00:24:38,599
so that was pretty exciting the other

529
00:24:36,299 --> 00:24:41,940
thing is that

530
00:24:38,599 --> 00:24:47,039
in 2010 essentially the plug was pulled

531
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:50,340
on intercultural I p.m. funding for new

532
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:52,259
york state and i got my letter saying

533
00:24:50,339 --> 00:24:55,500
that I wasn't have a job as six months

534
00:24:52,259 --> 00:24:59,579
and you're all kind of bummed out in

535
00:24:55,500 --> 00:25:01,650
idea and at that time for the 2011

536
00:24:59,579 --> 00:25:04,789
fiscal year and you can see it is the

537
00:25:01,650 --> 00:25:08,970
blue bar drops here

538
00:25:04,789 --> 00:25:10,579
for the 2011 fiscal year no funny at all

539
00:25:08,970 --> 00:25:14,519
was

540
00:25:10,579 --> 00:25:16,710
reinstated for New York at all and I was

541
00:25:14,519 --> 00:25:19,829
faced with a five-thousand-dollar tunnel

542
00:25:16,710 --> 00:25:22,890
so every single modem connected weather

543
00:25:19,829 --> 00:25:24,809
instrument was eliminated and growers

544
00:25:22,890 --> 00:25:28,440
were given the option to purchase a ring

545
00:25:24,809 --> 00:25:29,809
wise instrument so that had a huge

546
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:33,269
impact

547
00:25:29,809 --> 00:25:35,740
but at the same time Massachusetts and

548
00:25:33,269 --> 00:25:39,980
Vermont we're interested in joining and

549
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:41,690
so it was like the perfect scenario so I

550
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:46,099
said okay you can join me to have to pay

551
00:25:41,690 --> 00:25:49,279
a fee and so thus was born fiscal

552
00:25:46,099 --> 00:25:53,299
irresponsibility in Nuala and among all

553
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:56,509
of us but it has since created almost a

554
00:25:53,299 --> 00:25:58,279
nightmare abroad quite rare although I'm

555
00:25:56,509 --> 00:26:01,579
only supposed to be dividing five to ten

556
00:25:58,279 --> 00:26:04,250
percent my time on nua ooh i'm getting a

557
00:26:01,579 --> 00:26:07,789
little bit more than that as you can

558
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:12,240
well imagine and we are now hiring a new

559
00:26:07,789 --> 00:26:15,599
coordinator so we were successful

560
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:18,089
to plug that position and are at IPL

561
00:26:15,599 --> 00:26:20,819
funding this year it was reinstated to

562
00:26:18,089 --> 00:26:24,470
the 2010 level so that was really

563
00:26:20,819 --> 00:26:24,470
decided to but it helped

564
00:26:24,558 --> 00:26:31,700
so this is just to give you all the logo

565
00:26:28,089 --> 00:26:34,519
so you have I know we're moving away

566
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:38,090
from printed a niche or hieroglyphic

567
00:26:34,519 --> 00:26:41,450
communication in our sort of language

568
00:26:38,089 --> 00:26:43,548
based so these are all our current

569
00:26:41,450 --> 00:26:46,129
partners and the thing that's really

570
00:26:43,548 --> 00:26:49,819
exciting is that the state of Minnesota

571
00:26:46,128 --> 00:26:52,099
and the state of North Carolina are full

572
00:26:49,819 --> 00:26:54,439
members because of the Apple River

573
00:26:52,099 --> 00:26:57,288
substitutions in those states and

574
00:26:54,440 --> 00:27:00,288
probably the biggest driver is the Apple

575
00:26:57,288 --> 00:27:04,749
proper management tool the apple from a

576
00:27:00,288 --> 00:27:04,749
hybrid thing is revolutionary

577
00:27:05,329 --> 00:27:10,909
the new partners are becoming so I've

578
00:27:08,359 --> 00:27:13,569
been talking with the state from atala G

579
00:27:10,910 --> 00:27:16,550
offices in North Carolina and Delaware

580
00:27:13,569 --> 00:27:18,139
and the exciting thing is environment

581
00:27:16,549 --> 00:27:19,490
whether started collaborating with us

582
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:21,740
this year we're just putting the

583
00:27:19,490 --> 00:27:24,170
finishing touches on programming the

584
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:25,210
ingestion of their data from their state

585
00:27:24,170 --> 00:27:29,029
climatologist

586
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:31,579
a also have a nua type system and they

587
00:27:29,029 --> 00:27:33,589
have models that can benefit us as well

588
00:27:31,579 --> 00:27:34,619
as the models that we have they mostly

589
00:27:33,589 --> 00:27:37,928
want

590
00:27:34,619 --> 00:27:40,178
and then there's a new york state

591
00:27:37,929 --> 00:27:44,070
resident is being constructed right now

592
00:27:40,179 --> 00:27:47,559
across New York funded by FEMA after

593
00:27:44,069 --> 00:27:50,528
sandy and I mean devastated that's an

594
00:27:47,558 --> 00:27:53,019
ally you want Iowa and New York seat so

595
00:27:50,528 --> 00:27:54,429
we are going R and marking our talks

596
00:27:53,019 --> 00:27:57,278
with them to see that I'm going to get

597
00:27:54,429 --> 00:27:59,440
their data a climate smart farming group

598
00:27:57,278 --> 00:28:02,648
por el new student for climate smart

599
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:05,710
solutions is developing some tools or

600
00:28:02,648 --> 00:28:07,268
climate and I'm excited about what they

601
00:28:05,710 --> 00:28:09,880
are going to be developing because then

602
00:28:07,269 --> 00:28:12,400
that's something else

603
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:15,070
provides an additional benefit to our

604
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:17,050
users and this fall we'll be talking

605
00:28:15,069 --> 00:28:19,059
with Glenn Taylor at interest you've

606
00:28:17,049 --> 00:28:22,569
made to see about getting a grade our

607
00:28:19,059 --> 00:28:24,119
models that he has for apples embedded

608
00:28:22,569 --> 00:28:27,159
into new one

609
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:28,979
our stakeholder priorities obviously the

610
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:32,259
top one is stable funding

611
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:34,450
responsive web design for station

612
00:28:32,259 --> 00:28:38,079
locations via the use of the National

613
00:28:34,450 --> 00:28:40,950
Digital forecast database which has

614
00:28:38,079 --> 00:28:45,250
about one kilometer resolution

615
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:47,680
more apps alerts many growers want to be

616
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:50,589
able to save their brain tip date or to

617
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:53,560
save that seeing date or whatever it is

618
00:28:50,589 --> 00:28:55,990
that they are putting in as an input for

619
00:28:53,559 --> 00:28:59,048
their bio fix they like knew what to say

620
00:28:55,990 --> 00:29:00,179
that we are set up to do that yet

621
00:28:59,048 --> 00:29:01,888
do that

622
00:29:00,179 --> 00:29:04,690
station maintenance troubleshooting

623
00:29:01,888 --> 00:29:06,178
promoting awareness so that's why I'm

624
00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:10,019
here

625
00:29:06,179 --> 00:29:13,570
we had a planning any among all of our

626
00:29:10,019 --> 00:29:15,278
members and out that came four

627
00:29:13,569 --> 00:29:17,888
objectives we definitely want a

628
00:29:15,278 --> 00:29:20,079
responsive web design I mean know what

629
00:29:17,888 --> 00:29:22,748
does work okay on a smartphone there are

630
00:29:20,079 --> 00:29:25,480
some platforms that it that sort of map

631
00:29:22,749 --> 00:29:28,659
product skilled work so we definitely

632
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:30,669
need this new up premium products would

633
00:29:28,659 --> 00:29:32,980
allow us to charge potentially a

634
00:29:30,669 --> 00:29:35,350
subscription fee if we were to develop

635
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:37,509
an end user cash and have a premium side

636
00:29:35,349 --> 00:29:40,089
to nua you may be able to have a

637
00:29:37,509 --> 00:29:42,579
subscription and thus improve our

638
00:29:40,089 --> 00:29:44,408
funding base and eliminate the need for

639
00:29:42,579 --> 00:29:47,579
the yearly fees that are paid by the

640
00:29:44,409 --> 00:29:51,070
land grant institutions

641
00:29:47,579 --> 00:29:53,230
the virtual stations that was third and

642
00:29:51,069 --> 00:29:55,769
then the fourth objective we talked

643
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:58,690
about was to create a developer sandbox

644
00:29:55,769 --> 00:30:01,659
this would essentially be behind the

645
00:29:58,690 --> 00:30:04,200
scenes where the researcher developer

646
00:30:01,659 --> 00:30:07,869
could go in it can create a tool

647
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:10,619
see that's working validated and then if

648
00:30:07,868 --> 00:30:10,618
it's working well

649
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:16,710
yes to

650
00:30:18,359 --> 00:30:24,389
so what kind of data of the weather data

651
00:30:21,630 --> 00:30:26,670
research have we been up to we did

652
00:30:24,390 --> 00:30:28,680
create a leaf like this estimator we had

653
00:30:26,670 --> 00:30:31,560
to have that for airport locations they

654
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:33,740
don't have any redness sensors and we

655
00:30:31,559 --> 00:30:35,970
did a little bit of work on this there's

656
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:39,150
more work that needs to be done on that

657
00:30:35,970 --> 00:30:42,120
but we are estimating leaf lettuce for a

658
00:30:39,150 --> 00:30:45,269
hour with relative humidity above 90

659
00:30:42,119 --> 00:30:47,329
we're counting that as a wet our we

660
00:30:45,269 --> 00:30:51,480
haven't gotten any complaints yet

661
00:30:47,329 --> 00:30:55,009
we are using oh and I should say that

662
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:57,779
the airport relative humidity is

663
00:30:55,009 --> 00:31:01,970
error corrected because it's surrounded

664
00:30:57,779 --> 00:31:01,970
by target and the bike

665
00:31:02,779 --> 00:31:07,149
the microclimate there is vastly

666
00:31:05,150 --> 00:31:10,450
different from

667
00:31:07,150 --> 00:31:13,880
agricultural so

668
00:31:10,450 --> 00:31:16,340
we are looking at data quality control

669
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:19,730
for precipitation orange alert on Planet

670
00:31:16,339 --> 00:31:21,589
Center is working on this and then keith

671
00:31:19,730 --> 00:31:23,380
Ellison who worship the climate center

672
00:31:21,589 --> 00:31:26,149
looks at the solar radiation data

673
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:28,760
periodically and eliminate stations with

674
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:31,100
that solar radiation data from the Apple

675
00:31:28,759 --> 00:31:32,750
thinking tool and then we're going to be

676
00:31:31,099 --> 00:31:34,599
looking at temperature and humidity

677
00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:37,069
we've got a project for that

678
00:31:34,599 --> 00:31:39,049
it would be really great to be able to

679
00:31:37,069 --> 00:31:41,149
do research to compare that national

680
00:31:39,049 --> 00:31:44,930
digital forecast database with our own

681
00:31:41,150 --> 00:31:46,850
internal stations and vice versa there s

682
00:31:44,930 --> 00:31:50,920
the meteorologists and climatologists

683
00:31:46,849 --> 00:31:50,919
tell me that's a really

684
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:58,250
fertil research and then right now

685
00:31:55,759 --> 00:32:01,038
they're looking at soil temperature

686
00:31:58,250 --> 00:32:02,630
estimates compared to actual swale

687
00:32:01,038 --> 00:32:05,509
sensors they're being placed in the

688
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:08,090
ground Sgt Products Group do a soil

689
00:32:05,509 --> 00:32:09,589
temperature estimate map for us that we

690
00:32:08,089 --> 00:32:13,178
are planning to implement in a weed

691
00:32:09,589 --> 00:32:13,178
germination model down the line

692
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:19,810
currently on funded we have developed a

693
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:23,200
sentence a scale model for apples that's

694
00:32:19,809 --> 00:32:26,169
new this year RM y LOL fat without a

695
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:28,690

696
00:32:26,170 --> 00:32:31,779
cox and i are looking to incorporate the

697
00:32:28,690 --> 00:32:33,910

698
00:32:31,779 --> 00:32:36,730
bite into the Apple fire blight tool

699
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:39,009
Mary white as a copyrighted model it's

700
00:32:36,730 --> 00:32:40,750
pretty available online but we can't

701
00:32:39,009 --> 00:32:43,990
just incorporate an initiative oh

702
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:46,000
because it's copyrighted and alan digs

703
00:32:43,990 --> 00:32:49,660
at the pursuit maryland has been working

704
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:52,390
with carrot on that Betsy lab in I p.m.

705
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:54,279
got a grant from the art for my ability

706
00:32:52,390 --> 00:32:56,950
Institute to develop woody orbital

707
00:32:54,279 --> 00:32:59,859
insect create tools and the Christmas

708
00:32:56,950 --> 00:33:03,130
tree Growers early jazz about this Greg

709
00:32:59,859 --> 00:33:04,240
lobe Carrie Cox and I got some funding

710
00:33:03,130 --> 00:33:06,550
from the New York berry Growers

711
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:08,710
Association you know very insect and

712
00:33:06,549 --> 00:33:12,309
disease balls embarking on that this

713
00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:15,660
year a nadie childer has an scr I

714
00:33:12,309 --> 00:33:18,940
planning Brad she is alone

715
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:22,450
Michigan State University and this will

716
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:24,610
be on blueberry fruit box if there's a

717
00:33:22,450 --> 00:33:26,880
wish list of over 40 miles I mean if

718
00:33:24,609 --> 00:33:31,289
there's just you know as many research

719
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:31,290
you guys doing all this great work

720
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:39,009
so where are the impacts and outcomes

721
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:41,798
so nuanced transyl transforming weather

722
00:33:39,009 --> 00:33:44,140
knowledge into tools farmers are sharing

723
00:33:41,798 --> 00:33:47,139
their weather data resources through

724
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:49,750
cloud computing and the forecasts are

725
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:51,820
pushing the results out five days we can

726
00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:53,548
probably go we could probably go a week

727
00:33:51,819 --> 00:33:57,138
and

728
00:33:53,548 --> 00:34:00,349
get too nervous and that makes these

729
00:33:57,138 --> 00:34:02,939
actually disease forecast models

730
00:34:00,349 --> 00:34:05,038
because they were always called

731
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:08,068
two-piece forecast models but we only

732
00:34:05,038 --> 00:34:09,838
had weather data to say Oh to them you

733
00:34:08,068 --> 00:34:14,068
have an apple scab infection that two

734
00:34:09,838 --> 00:34:16,019
days ago about that now so so that's

735
00:34:14,068 --> 00:34:19,108
kind of exciting to the owner you know

736
00:34:16,019 --> 00:34:22,168
forecast the step out so somatic does

737
00:34:19,108 --> 00:34:24,298
from growers that I've heard I use the

738
00:34:22,168 --> 00:34:25,250
newest site almost every day early in

739
00:34:24,298 --> 00:34:29,659
the season

740
00:34:25,250 --> 00:34:31,889
the second one was a little more

741
00:34:29,659 --> 00:34:33,898
denigrating towards us assume that the

742
00:34:31,889 --> 00:34:36,750
previously been used but the first was

743
00:34:33,898 --> 00:34:38,578
saying before chur was scam free for the

744
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:40,168
first time in several years and the

745
00:34:38,579 --> 00:34:41,169
orchard manager and who might hell de

746
00:34:40,168 --> 00:34:45,039
agua

747
00:34:41,168 --> 00:34:46,719
and when Cowgill Rutgers said that to

748
00:34:45,039 --> 00:34:49,148
New Jersey apple growers reported the

749
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:51,469
best slimming results ever in 2015

750
00:34:49,148 --> 00:34:54,808
residuals

751
00:34:51,469 --> 00:34:57,419
so i guess i would say that nua promotes

752
00:34:54,809 --> 00:35:00,059
better idea reduced pesticide use to

753
00:34:57,420 --> 00:35:02,130
improve environmental protection better

754
00:35:00,059 --> 00:35:05,309
crop management improved crop quality

755
00:35:02,130 --> 00:35:07,519
and improved healed and certainly

756
00:35:05,309 --> 00:35:11,010
enhanced decision support

757
00:35:07,518 --> 00:35:13,469
in 2007 before we launched the website

758
00:35:11,010 --> 00:35:17,480
I've just showed you we launched that

759
00:35:13,469 --> 00:35:17,480
website 2009 it's like geriatric

760
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:23,530
but in 2007 when he surveyed brokers

761
00:35:20,838 --> 00:35:27,289
about the impact of you off on I p.m.

762
00:35:23,530 --> 00:35:30,109
you can see that the vast majority

763
00:35:27,289 --> 00:35:32,420
agreed or strongly agreed that new I

764
00:35:30,108 --> 00:35:37,299
helps reduce phrase improves great

765
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:40,519
timing alert a pest risk and enhance IPM

766
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:42,820
brokers in that survey reported that

767
00:35:40,519 --> 00:35:45,588
they would say on average

768
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:47,720
19,500 per year and spray costs and

769
00:35:45,588 --> 00:35:50,719
prevent a quarter of a million dollars

770
00:35:47,719 --> 00:35:53,480
per year in from Los and these are high

771
00:35:50,719 --> 00:35:56,059
value horticultural crops so these are

772
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:58,639
primarily apple growers grape growers

773
00:35:56,059 --> 00:36:00,710
and a few onion and potato firms that

774
00:35:58,639 --> 00:36:03,309
were responding to the survey back in

775
00:36:00,710 --> 00:36:06,210
two thousand seven our audience is much

776
00:36:03,309 --> 00:36:10,299
larger and broader now obviously and

777
00:36:06,210 --> 00:36:13,329
this piece I didn't believe it I went

778
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:16,720
over these web stats I think probably

779
00:36:13,329 --> 00:36:19,329
four times but we are experiencing over

780
00:36:16,719 --> 00:36:21,639
two million pageviews per here at page

781
00:36:19,329 --> 00:36:24,670
views when somebody spends at least 30

782
00:36:21,639 --> 00:36:26,559
minutes on your web page okay it's not

783
00:36:24,670 --> 00:36:29,220
just a click and are gone it's not yet

784
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:32,889
this is a page view

785
00:36:29,219 --> 00:36:36,279
so Noah is access to IPO decision

786
00:36:32,889 --> 00:36:38,529
support an IPO is all about sustainable

787
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:40,869
management of pests using methods that

788
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:44,019
minimize environmental health and

803
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:29,070
for anna developer sandbox and with that

804
00:37:24,838 --> 00:37:33,889
thank you and open it up for questions

805
00:37:29,070 --> 00:37:35,599
[Applause]

806
00:37:33,889 --> 00:37:38,608
so

807
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:40,289
i have two questions the first is would

808
00:37:38,608 --> 00:37:42,538
you describe that the populations of

809
00:37:40,289 --> 00:37:44,250
station owners consist of growers and

810
00:37:42,539 --> 00:37:47,940
airports where r is there another

811
00:37:44,250 --> 00:37:50,608
population okay yeah so I had that

812
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:52,519
slider to get out so the people who own

813
00:37:50,608 --> 00:37:56,058
weather stations

814
00:37:52,519 --> 00:37:59,369
include growers

815
00:37:56,059 --> 00:38:00,960
they include land-grant universities so

816
00:37:59,369 --> 00:38:02,849
the Connecticut University of

817
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:04,500
Connecticut doesn't matter that's

818
00:38:02,849 --> 00:38:08,460
connected to New all the rain wise

819
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:10,980
instruments are owned by DuPont so some

820
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:13,588
land grant universities decide they're

821
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:17,338
going to grant fund their entire resume

822
00:38:13,588 --> 00:38:19,869
and put in but they do it typically on

823
00:38:17,338 --> 00:38:22,088
farms that makes

824
00:38:19,869 --> 00:38:24,369
can I give one ive one in every county

825
00:38:22,088 --> 00:38:28,058
so they did that and I think those are

826
00:38:24,369 --> 00:38:32,190
on schools or above turf grass so long

827
00:38:28,059 --> 00:38:34,048
that type of thing there is a randomized

828
00:38:32,190 --> 00:38:37,150
connected instrument at the Arnold

829
00:38:34,048 --> 00:38:40,000
Arboretum our universities

830
00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:42,099
there is a weather station in the

831
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:44,710
Adirondacks that's really associated

832
00:38:42,099 --> 00:38:47,019
with a natural area but the person who

833
00:38:44,710 --> 00:38:49,179
installed it one in debris days because

834
00:38:47,019 --> 00:38:50,338
they do research on insects in insect

835
00:38:49,179 --> 00:38:53,618
phenology

836
00:38:50,338 --> 00:38:57,099
there are the state doesn't it's so

837
00:38:53,619 --> 00:38:59,079
Rutgers Meza net they have I think three

838
00:38:57,099 --> 00:39:02,318
different styles of whether it's plugged

839
00:38:59,079 --> 00:39:05,080
in to their doesn't it and so that

840
00:39:02,318 --> 00:39:08,440
that's another another

841
00:39:05,079 --> 00:39:09,779
but by and large we try to ask the

842
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:12,720
growers

843
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:16,780
recently we had Champlain Valley

844
00:39:12,719 --> 00:39:19,179
agronomic join us they have 22 ray noise

845
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:21,430
instruments in the Adirondacks in the

846
00:39:19,179 --> 00:39:24,960
Champlain Valley primarily on dairy

847
00:39:21,429 --> 00:39:28,509
farms and they use the data because

848
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:31,599
concentrate confined papal confined

849
00:39:28,510 --> 00:39:34,720
animal feeding operations cannot spread

850
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:38,380
manure unless they have a record of the

851
00:39:34,719 --> 00:39:41,049
weather before and after they spread

852
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:43,900
that more and so that report was

853
00:39:41,050 --> 00:39:48,300
essential and this guy knows a lot about

854
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:48,300
rain wise instruments as homicide

855
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:55,769
you mentioned figure of five predicted

856
00:39:54,070 --> 00:39:57,660


857
00:39:55,768 --> 00:40:01,118
generalization that i took

858
00:39:57,659 --> 00:40:04,248
that means that

859
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:05,950
biology on the pathogen two sets of

860
00:40:04,248 --> 00:40:08,439
effective

861
00:40:05,949 --> 00:40:12,279
during that five day curry or the

862
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:15,099
previous trip is that correct depends on

863
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:17,890
a model ok let me obviously price

864
00:40:15,099 --> 00:40:20,550
because I was after the tractor I did

865
00:40:17,889 --> 00:40:24,489
not hear in presentation

866
00:40:20,550 --> 00:40:27,329
the role of incoming weather plays in

867
00:40:24,489 --> 00:40:29,679
terms of the development practices once

868
00:40:27,329 --> 00:40:34,660
everything else is the line for Disease

869
00:40:29,679 --> 00:40:37,389
Joker right right so predominantly for

870
00:40:34,659 --> 00:40:40,929
the most part the moments of predicting

871
00:40:37,389 --> 00:40:42,819
it is actually meant so it's getting

872
00:40:40,929 --> 00:40:44,679
into the planet well what about symptom

873
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:46,480
development is that where you're talking

874
00:40:44,679 --> 00:40:48,159
to what about the infection process and

875
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:49,900
the development of symptoms well the

876
00:40:48,159 --> 00:40:52,299
work can tell me more than going to

877
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:54,670
trigger the disease once you have all

878
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:58,570
those others things slide and I end up

879
00:40:54,670 --> 00:41:00,420
on a four day five to thirty right so

880
00:40:58,570 --> 00:41:03,700
depending on the model

881
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:06,588
the things that may be lining up could

882
00:41:03,699 --> 00:41:09,919
be hourly data it's the model baby

883
00:41:06,588 --> 00:41:12,670
data some most of the insect models only

884
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:16,608
need daily they only be the maximum in

885
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:18,249
the so the weather there only two

886
00:41:16,608 --> 00:41:20,389
instances where we're looking at

887
00:41:18,248 --> 00:41:23,268
development of disease and disease

888
00:41:20,389 --> 00:41:25,279
symptoms one is for Alice cabin the

889
00:41:23,268 --> 00:41:26,949
other is required

890
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:29,980
answering a question

891
00:41:26,949 --> 00:41:33,259
sorry from I just like doing this point

892
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:36,079
that point if you've got that

893
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:38,330
information that scene can occur during

894
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:40,699
this five day period

895
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:42,710
the forecaster then hires a girl would

896
00:41:40,699 --> 00:41:44,629
be paying real attention to the incoming

897
00:41:42,710 --> 00:41:47,240
letter and that's going to make a big

898
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:50,240
difference for them y squared absolutely

899
00:41:47,239 --> 00:41:52,039
absolutely adjustable so the growers got

900
00:41:50,239 --> 00:41:54,349
to play a role in this in terms of

901
00:41:52,039 --> 00:41:56,989
making that that spray decision based

902
00:41:54,349 --> 00:41:58,819
upon what he gets from other sources yes

903
00:41:56,989 --> 00:42:01,639
absolutely that's a really very good

904
00:41:58,820 --> 00:42:03,590
point because all of this is just what

905
00:42:01,639 --> 00:42:05,210
the grower sees and ultimately it's the

906
00:42:03,590 --> 00:42:07,760
grower that's going to make the decision

907
00:42:05,210 --> 00:42:11,150
so some apple farms that God is so large

908
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:14,510
that they can't cover in one day their

909
00:42:11,150 --> 00:42:17,150
sprayers cost a quarter billion dollars

910
00:42:14,510 --> 00:42:19,130
you know and they may only have one but

911
00:42:17,150 --> 00:42:22,970
they need five days to cover their

912
00:42:19,130 --> 00:42:25,130
orchard so that's where the size of the

913
00:42:22,969 --> 00:42:27,039
opera he asked Victor so there are all

914
00:42:25,130 --> 00:42:31,039
the kinds of things

915
00:42:27,039 --> 00:42:31,039
precision yes

916
00:42:37,909 --> 00:42:43,368
we measure

917
00:42:40,539 --> 00:42:46,190
I'm sorry okay the question is do we

918
00:42:43,369 --> 00:42:50,599
measure the economic impact of this

919
00:42:46,190 --> 00:42:53,769
program in a systematic way um not being

920
00:42:50,599 --> 00:42:53,769
an economist or

921
00:42:55,150 --> 00:43:02,358
what i did was i developed questions for

922
00:42:58,250 --> 00:43:06,500
the survey that basically we're asking

923
00:43:02,358 --> 00:43:09,558
the respondents to fill in how much it

924
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:12,619
was saving them in springs how much it

925
00:43:09,559 --> 00:43:16,039
was saving them estimated in crop loss i

926
00:43:12,619 --> 00:43:20,869
had to go back to that 2007 survey to

927
00:43:16,039 --> 00:43:20,869
see exactly how those reported wishlist

928
00:43:22,679 --> 00:43:29,339
so like the developers looking for a

929
00:43:24,690 --> 00:43:31,760
project and they go my brain is it will

930
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:38,100
be there right

931
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:40,650
yeah I have I am so many forward to

932
00:43:38,099 --> 00:43:46,199
having a new a coordinator so they can

933
00:43:40,650 --> 00:43:46,200
get this wish list and figured out yeah

934
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:53,730
I was kind of curious of the business

935
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:54,889
this is incorporated as a not-for-profit

936
00:43:53,730 --> 00:43:58,019
I

937
00:43:54,889 --> 00:43:59,730
wondered about additional but I learned

938
00:43:58,019 --> 00:44:01,650
about the issues of intellectual

939
00:43:59,730 --> 00:44:05,250
property

940
00:44:01,650 --> 00:44:08,309
notice the disclaimers on all sides of

941
00:44:05,250 --> 00:44:10,090
your pages but you've got a very complex

942
00:44:08,309 --> 00:44:14,760
to

943
00:44:10,090 --> 00:44:14,760
property for all sorts of sources here

944
00:44:14,929 --> 00:44:21,318
how that work

945
00:44:18,289 --> 00:44:23,859
okay so that's very good question do I

946
00:44:21,318 --> 00:44:28,278
need to repeat the question about IP

947
00:44:23,858 --> 00:44:31,478
okay so I'll talk I'll start with the

948
00:44:28,278 --> 00:44:35,358
disclaimers because that's the easy part

949
00:44:31,478 --> 00:44:37,788
about the time funding was just you know

950
00:44:35,358 --> 00:44:41,298
I didn't we didn't know it was going to

951
00:44:37,789 --> 00:44:45,219
go away but about that time I was poised

952
00:44:41,298 --> 00:44:47,588
to fully disclose new to

953
00:44:45,219 --> 00:44:50,838
university and

954
00:44:47,588 --> 00:44:53,509
when you no longer had fun day I had a

955
00:44:50,838 --> 00:44:56,538
lot more to do than that of what we did

956
00:44:53,509 --> 00:45:00,019
get done with cree el nino as we got the

957
00:44:56,539 --> 00:45:02,539
disclaimers written so that square on

958
00:45:00,018 --> 00:45:04,958
the website in total we'll talk about

959
00:45:02,539 --> 00:45:08,929
things like accuracy of the data

960
00:45:04,958 --> 00:45:11,509
etc the disclaimers on each individual

961
00:45:08,929 --> 00:45:13,789
tool we'll talk about this is a tool and

962
00:45:11,509 --> 00:45:17,739
only a tool and it is not a substitute

963
00:45:13,789 --> 00:45:21,099
for actual field observations etc

964
00:45:17,739 --> 00:45:27,068
in terms of intellectual property right

965
00:45:21,099 --> 00:45:29,579
we had based all the models that I know

966
00:45:27,068 --> 00:45:32,130
at this point on

967
00:45:29,579 --> 00:45:36,009
published literature

968
00:45:32,130 --> 00:45:38,039
therefore I don't think there would be

969
00:45:36,009 --> 00:45:41,940
an intellectual property rights issue

970
00:45:38,039 --> 00:45:45,339
there are developers to develop things

971
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:47,440
beyond new one they'll fry case a point

972
00:45:45,338 --> 00:45:51,400
for life life social supports this torch

973
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:56,259
now is called micro on another potential

974
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:58,088
would be the DL cast model we're on you

975
00:45:56,259 --> 00:46:00,369
know some company like along and say to

976
00:45:58,088 --> 00:46:02,619
the person who's primarily responsible

977
00:46:00,369 --> 00:46:06,039
for that research hey I'd love develop

978
00:46:02,619 --> 00:46:09,039
an app for that and that would be done I

979
00:46:06,039 --> 00:46:09,039
have

980
00:46:10,349 --> 00:46:17,029
this point not fully disclosed grew up

981
00:46:14,059 --> 00:46:21,000
what i have done is all the references

982
00:46:17,030 --> 00:46:23,460
for these models are posted online so

983
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:26,610
the key one or two references for every

984
00:46:23,460 --> 00:46:29,940
model that we have a new up is there

985
00:46:26,610 --> 00:46:32,010
online in its own place it's not

986
00:46:29,940 --> 00:46:34,309
actually with the model so they need in

987
00:46:32,010 --> 00:46:34,310
the future

988
00:46:34,670 --> 00:46:39,930
so I haven't done that

989
00:46:36,969 --> 00:46:39,929
and hope

990
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:44,309
thank you very much
