1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:04,320
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:13,360
University thank you so much I'm not

3
00:00:11,439 --> 00:00:16,879
sure I know the guy that he was talking

4
00:00:13,359 --> 00:00:18,519
about um it's a pleasure to be here um

5
00:00:16,879 --> 00:00:20,439
and I thought maybe the way to start

6
00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:24,198
this off would be to give you a sense of

7
00:00:20,439 --> 00:00:26,879
my personal Journey uh I I got my

8
00:00:24,199 --> 00:00:28,960
masters and PhD in astrophysics at a

9
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:31,960
university called University of

10
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:33,719
Pennsylvania

11
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:37,079
I I recognize him at

12
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:38,960
Cornell um and I was I was working in

13
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:41,679
planetary science for a little more than

14
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:44,399
a decade and a half and I decided to

15
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:48,359
make a switch to full-time National

16
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:50,920
Science Education um I I've always been

17
00:00:48,359 --> 00:00:53,479
fond of both research and education I I

18
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:55,719
remember uh when I was in high school I

19
00:00:53,479 --> 00:00:57,518
worked as an amenis for the New York

20
00:00:55,719 --> 00:01:00,239
State Department of Vocational

21
00:00:57,518 --> 00:01:02,198
Rehabilitation working with uh very

22
00:01:00,238 --> 00:01:04,920
physically disabled students who were

23
00:01:02,198 --> 00:01:08,200
brilliant trying to take them to the

24
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:10,519
next level up and um I felt that

25
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:14,159
education was just so vitally important

26
00:01:10,519 --> 00:01:17,199
to what it meant to be me that when I

27
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:19,719
had a chance to uh after my my PhD I had

28
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:22,520
an opportunity to work as a NASA I'm

29
00:01:19,719 --> 00:01:25,158
sorry a National Resources Council

30
00:01:22,519 --> 00:01:27,280
postdoc at Goddard space flight center

31
00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:28,880
or help establish a lab for astrophysics

32
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,400
at the National Air and Space Museum

33
00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:33,399
which is the most visited Museum on the

34
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:35,478
planet and I gave up the NRC postto and

35
00:01:33,399 --> 00:01:38,280
my my thesis adviser said nobody gives

36
00:01:35,478 --> 00:01:41,000
up an NRC postto what are you doing but

37
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:43,640
to to be able to do research at the

38
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,718
Smithsonian and also be able to tell

39
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:48,718
kids about it and teachers about it and

40
00:01:45,718 --> 00:01:50,718
families about what it's like to be a

41
00:01:48,718 --> 00:01:52,519
researcher um was really really

42
00:01:50,718 --> 00:01:55,640
important to me because research and

43
00:01:52,519 --> 00:01:58,078
education went hand in hand and so maybe

44
00:01:55,640 --> 00:02:00,000
what I I I should really start off by

45
00:01:58,078 --> 00:02:02,959
telling you a little bit about the the

46
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,280
emotional experience behind uh what I

47
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:07,438
did as a researcher and I can tell you

48
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,878
that um my friends and I at Goddard

49
00:02:07,438 --> 00:02:11,199
space flight center had to build a very

50
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:12,919
special machine called an infrared

51
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:14,479
heterodon spectrometer this was my

52
00:02:12,919 --> 00:02:16,679
graduate work at Godard space flight

53
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:18,679
center and we would take this machine

54
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:20,959
which would fill a nice-sized classroom

55
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:23,319
it was a big machine um out into the

56
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:26,039
middle of the Pacific Basin and we would

57
00:02:23,318 --> 00:02:28,159
take it to the top of Mona which is on

58
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:31,280
the big island of Hawaii we take it up

59
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:32,799
14,000 ft almost 3 miles into the sky

60
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:35,000
hook it to some of the most powerful

61
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:38,239
telescopes on planet Earth point it to

62
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,199
planets tens of millions of miles away

63
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:42,360
and we would uh measure temperature and

64
00:02:40,199 --> 00:02:44,439
composition of the atmosphere and the

65
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:46,800
Very Special laser system that I built

66
00:02:44,439 --> 00:02:48,560
which was my baby allowed us to measure

67
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:51,959
gentle breezes on these planets so we

68
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:54,878
were able to build um the a model of the

69
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:57,158
global circulation the global winds of

70
00:02:54,878 --> 00:02:59,799
of these planets and so I was sort of

71
00:02:57,158 --> 00:03:03,120
like an interplanetary weather guy and

72
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:05,200
and uh I could talk hours about why you

73
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:07,840
would want to do that why you would want

74
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:11,039
to look at weather across the family of

75
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:12,200
Worlds as a means of getting a better

76
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:13,919
understanding of what drives weather

77
00:03:12,199 --> 00:03:16,158
here on Earth but I really wanted to

78
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:18,318
talk about the emotional context of what

79
00:03:16,158 --> 00:03:20,598
it was like on Mona and in fact I have a

80
00:03:18,318 --> 00:03:23,518
slide of

81
00:03:20,598 --> 00:03:24,919
this this is the summit of Mona and you

82
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:28,438
you see some of the most powerful

83
00:03:24,919 --> 00:03:30,318
telescopes on Earth um this is the kek 1

84
00:03:28,438 --> 00:03:32,719
and 2 telescopes this is the telescope

85
00:03:30,318 --> 00:03:35,318
that we used back in the mid 1980s

86
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:39,400
through the early 1990s it's the NASA

87
00:03:35,318 --> 00:03:41,438
infrared telescope facility and um the

88
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:43,680
the summit of mon is really interesting

89
00:03:41,438 --> 00:03:46,079
because let's see this is

90
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,480
Subaru this is the Japanese national

91
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,560
telescope does anybody know why it's

92
00:03:47,479 --> 00:03:51,598
called

93
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:54,438
Subaru what do you see on the back of a

94
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:56,078
Subaru it wasn't named after the car

95
00:03:54,438 --> 00:03:58,719
what do you see on the back of a Subaru

96
00:03:56,079 --> 00:04:00,560
what's the symbol stars in Japanese

97
00:03:58,719 --> 00:04:02,158
Subaru means the ple

98
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,318
and so this is the Japanese national

99
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:07,679
telescope and you go up to the summit of

100
00:04:04,318 --> 00:04:10,199
Mona and uh you go up um towards the

101
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:12,480
afternoon um right after dinner which is

102
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:15,078
your first meal of the day and you work

103
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:17,159
all night and you come back down and you

104
00:04:15,079 --> 00:04:19,600
go and have breakfast just before you go

105
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:21,519
to sleep and you have breakfast with

106
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,759
people working from all over planet

107
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:26,120
Earth I mean scientists from from every

108
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:27,720
corner of this planet and you you sit

109
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:29,120
down over breakfast and you talk about

110
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:30,360
what you're researching and somebody

111
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,240
might be looking at planetary

112
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:34,120
atmospheres or somebody might be looking

113
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:37,038
for planets around other stars and how

114
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:39,478
the universe was born or how stars form

115
00:04:37,038 --> 00:04:41,839
and it's just a remarkable experience

116
00:04:39,478 --> 00:04:45,639
because this place knows no this place

117
00:04:41,839 --> 00:04:49,279
knows no National boundaries it's about

118
00:04:45,639 --> 00:04:52,240
Humanity pushing the envelope and so a

119
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:54,599
few years back a teacher came to me at a

120
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,680
professional development she said what

121
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:58,320
does it feel like to work on the summit

122
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:01,319
of Mona what does it feel like to do

123
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:04,279
research up there and and so I I thought

124
00:05:01,319 --> 00:05:06,680
about that and I came up with really

125
00:05:04,279 --> 00:05:08,679
three levels of emotion that you feel on

126
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:11,400
the summit um the first thing that's

127
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:13,360
really remarkable is that when you go um

128
00:05:11,399 --> 00:05:15,758
to the summit of mon and the puffy white

129
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:18,319
cumulus clouds roll in they roll in a

130
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:20,800
mile below your feet so you're like on a

131
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:22,520
rock floating in the middle of the sky

132
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,919
and when the sun sets and the sunsets

133
00:05:22,519 --> 00:05:26,918
are absolutely

134
00:05:23,918 --> 00:05:28,439
spectacular um countless Stars 10,000

135
00:05:26,918 --> 00:05:30,918
Stars fill the heavens and if you've

136
00:05:28,439 --> 00:05:33,560
been to a dark here on the surface of

137
00:05:30,918 --> 00:05:35,639
the Earth and went oh wow looking up at

138
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:37,519
the at the heavens that's nothing

139
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:40,038
compared to what you see at 14,000 F

140
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:42,120
feet almost three miles into the sky and

141
00:05:40,038 --> 00:05:45,399
so here you are on the highest point on

142
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:48,199
Earth looking out into the universe the

143
00:05:45,399 --> 00:05:49,879
Milky Way galaxy are the is this double

144
00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:52,240
band of white that just Arches from

145
00:05:49,879 --> 00:05:54,600
Heaven to Heaven 10,000 Stars fill your

146
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:57,280
sky and the only word that I've ever

147
00:05:54,600 --> 00:06:00,879
come up with that has some chance of

148
00:05:57,279 --> 00:06:04,638
describing what you feel in that moment

149
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:07,759
is Majesty you are standing here looking

150
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:10,160
out at majesty and what's really

151
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:11,598
remarkable about that story is that

152
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:14,840
you're not looking at it from the

153
00:06:11,598 --> 00:06:17,839
outside you're part of it and it's part

154
00:06:14,839 --> 00:06:20,839
of you which means that you are the

155
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:23,560
universe contemplating

156
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:27,079
itself that's a remarkable statement but

157
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:29,720
it's absolutely true and the next level

158
00:06:27,079 --> 00:06:32,000
of emotion that you feel is when you

159
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:34,840
shift your gaze down to the Horizon you

160
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:38,279
see all of these these instruments of

161
00:06:34,839 --> 00:06:40,399
exploration this this this set of

162
00:06:38,279 --> 00:06:43,598
powerful telescopes that peer to the

163
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:46,679
edge of the known universe and you get

164
00:06:43,598 --> 00:06:48,319
this overwhelming sense of history that

165
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:51,759
standing on the shoulders of past

166
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:54,720
Generations this is what we are doing

167
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:57,199
that you are part of a legacy of human

168
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:59,599
exploration and the way that it works is

169
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:02,199
quite remarkable because every gen

170
00:06:59,598 --> 00:07:05,079
generation adds to the body of knowledge

171
00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:07,160
every generation grows frail and every

172
00:07:05,079 --> 00:07:09,959
generation in that moment reaches down

173
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:12,879
to the children and says it's your turn

174
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:16,120
to take us where we've never been it's

175
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:17,639
it's your turn and be content in knowing

176
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:20,000
that all of the knowledge that was

177
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:21,960
passed to me by prior Generations I give

178
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,079
to you and all of the knowledge that

179
00:07:21,959 --> 00:07:27,918
I've acquired in my my generation and my

180
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:31,120
time I give to you take us where we've

181
00:07:27,918 --> 00:07:34,519
never been before and and after all of

182
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:37,360
that sweat and toil this is the state of

183
00:07:34,519 --> 00:07:39,079
human exploration pushing back the

184
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:41,080
envelope of human understanding in terms

185
00:07:39,079 --> 00:07:44,240
of Earth's place in a greater

186
00:07:41,079 --> 00:07:47,839
space the the third level of motion is

187
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:49,918
is really personal and I guess it

188
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:53,119
happened when I the the laser system

189
00:07:49,918 --> 00:07:55,839
that I I built is really pnic it's got

190
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:57,959
um a detector that has to have a it has

191
00:07:55,839 --> 00:08:00,399
to be kept cold at liquid nitrogen

192
00:07:57,959 --> 00:08:03,000
temperatures um the laser itself has

193
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:05,158
Mirrors On actuators where the actuators

194
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,959
have to have a certain high voltage

195
00:08:05,158 --> 00:08:09,478
feedback on them and so you're

196
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:11,198
constantly babying this thing and so in

197
00:08:09,478 --> 00:08:13,560
the middle of the night some something

198
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:15,079
like 300 or 4 in the morning while my

199
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:16,560
friend is controlling this massive

200
00:08:15,079 --> 00:08:18,560
telescope with a joystick we were

201
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,120
looking at Venus at the time and there's

202
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,759
this big image of Venus on the TV

203
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:23,959
monitor with a Crosshair as to where

204
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:26,000
we're we're taking the data I'm I'm

205
00:08:23,959 --> 00:08:28,038
sitting there playing on on my laser

206
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,759
getting it all you know all back to

207
00:08:28,038 --> 00:08:32,679
normal and I realized hey this is really

208
00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:34,680
cool look what you're doing you're

209
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:36,799
seeing the For the First Time The Winds

210
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:38,679
of Mars The Winds of Venus and you

211
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:41,319
started out in Little Red Train Nursery

212
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:43,559
School I remember that moment I said I

213
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:44,959
started out and I I when when kids when

214
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:46,958
I if I go to a classroom and they say

215
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:48,319
where do you go to school I say well I

216
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:49,799
started in little red tray nursery

217
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,040
school and they kind of Grimace because

218
00:08:49,799 --> 00:08:53,679
they they're trying to figure out what

219
00:08:51,039 --> 00:08:55,360
university you went to but the point is

220
00:08:53,679 --> 00:08:58,519
I started out in little red tray nursery

221
00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:01,000
school and I figured out those gifts

222
00:08:58,519 --> 00:09:04,200
that I had and those things that I love

223
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:06,078
and I worked at them and I got to a

224
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:07,800
point where I I made decisions along the

225
00:09:06,078 --> 00:09:10,000
way I got to the point where I was on

226
00:09:07,799 --> 00:09:11,799
the frontier of human exploration and

227
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,440
every time I took a personal step to

228
00:09:11,799 --> 00:09:16,199
places I've never been I took the entire

229
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:18,360
entire human race with me That's What

230
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:21,120
exploration is all about and it doesn't

231
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:23,320
matter if it's science or art or poetry

232
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:25,399
if you put brush to canvas in a way

233
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:27,320
nobody's ever done before or Pros to

234
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:30,360
paper in in a way that nobody's ever

235
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:32,720
done before or in in Athletics you you

236
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:34,560
do something that's quite remarkable

237
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,560
you're pushing the envelope for the

238
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:39,119
human race you're taking us all where

239
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:42,879
we've never been before and what I

240
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:45,159
realized was the power of one that one

241
00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:47,200
person has the ability to set their

242
00:09:45,159 --> 00:09:49,480
sights in a in a certain direction and

243
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:52,959
take the race where we've never been the

244
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:55,720
power of one and so those three levels

245
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:58,518
of emotion again are the sense that

246
00:09:55,720 --> 00:10:00,240
you're part of this this universe this

247
00:09:58,519 --> 00:10:03,440
Majesty

248
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:06,879
and and you have the ability to reveal

249
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:09,360
how she operates you've got this sense

250
00:10:06,879 --> 00:10:11,240
that you're part of a lineage of human

251
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:13,680
explorers that we've been doing this for

252
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:16,278
countless generations and working

253
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:18,799
together we're doing remarkable things

254
00:10:16,278 --> 00:10:20,600
and you get a sense that just one person

255
00:10:18,799 --> 00:10:22,199
has the ability to do something quite

256
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:24,920
powerful and

257
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:27,399
extraordinary I'm describing

258
00:10:24,919 --> 00:10:30,519
science and I think that you hear in my

259
00:10:27,399 --> 00:10:32,759
voice a level of emotion which you know

260
00:10:30,519 --> 00:10:34,799
goes contrary to the way you normally

261
00:10:32,759 --> 00:10:36,838
picture scientists right look I don't

262
00:10:34,799 --> 00:10:39,879
wear a pocket protector I don't have a

263
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:41,519
white lab coat um I I know a lot of my

264
00:10:39,879 --> 00:10:43,159
friends do have white lab coats but I

265
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:44,839
don't associate with pocket protectors I

266
00:10:43,159 --> 00:10:47,679
don't no that's not true I just don't

267
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:51,440
have one um but the the the point though

268
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:54,000
is that science is a very emotional

269
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:56,320
experience and in fact let me broaden

270
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,839
that to human exploration in general

271
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:00,959
because in a little while I'll talk

272
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:04,000
about about science and I think the

273
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:06,319
point that I really need to make is that

274
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,679
science the the scientific method which

275
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:12,600
by the way is taught badly often as a

276
00:11:09,679 --> 00:11:15,239
rigid recipe for success as opposed to

277
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:17,240
an art form the scientific method is a

278
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:20,519
misnomer because science doesn't own it

279
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:22,839
it's the way we learn it's the way we

280
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:24,759
explore and that's discipline

281
00:11:22,839 --> 00:11:28,639
independent

282
00:11:24,759 --> 00:11:30,600
so let me just say and let me ask if if

283
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:32,120
you have the definitions down because I

284
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:34,000
want to tell you a little story very

285
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:38,600
fast is the Sun a

286
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,600
star how many folks are are science

287
00:11:39,078 --> 00:11:45,000
Majors uh I was going to say education

288
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:47,679
well education

289
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,879
undergrads maybe sort of you're kind of

290
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:52,120
you're on the fence okay what who else

291
00:11:49,879 --> 00:11:52,120
is

292
00:11:52,519 --> 00:11:59,519
here this is an audience participation

293
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:02,039
situation education gra education grad

294
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:04,799
students anybody else science grad

295
00:12:02,039 --> 00:12:07,039
students science grad students okay so

296
00:12:04,799 --> 00:12:09,078
good good mix so I have to ask this qu

297
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:10,439
these questions because it's a good mix

298
00:12:09,078 --> 00:12:14,239
is the sun a

299
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:17,199
star like the stars in the sky yes

300
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:18,919
sure okay why does the sun look so

301
00:12:17,198 --> 00:12:21,000
different why does it look so big and

302
00:12:18,919 --> 00:12:24,360
bright because it's really really really

303
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:26,399
really close right what's a Galaxy if

304
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:29,560
you're all stars what do you call it

305
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:32,519
when stars like to hold together Galaxy

306
00:12:29,559 --> 00:12:35,838
and our galaxy is the Milky Way okay

307
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:38,440
good so here's the story you all live in

308
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:42,199
Ithaca New York and a in an apartment or

309
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:44,560
a dorm or a house in the state of of of

310
00:12:42,198 --> 00:12:46,319
New York in the United States of America

311
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:48,439
on a continent called North America on a

312
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:50,760
planet called Earth in a planetary

313
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:53,000
system called the solar system which is

314
00:12:50,759 --> 00:12:54,799
the family of a tiny little dwarf star

315
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,679
we call the sun in the local solar

316
00:12:54,799 --> 00:12:59,439
neighborhood in the Orion spur of the

317
00:12:57,679 --> 00:13:01,679
Milky Way galaxy

318
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:04,000
a Galaxy by the way which has enough

319
00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:06,799
stars to give 50 stars to every human

320
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,759
being on earth and the Milky Way galaxy

321
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:12,719
is in the local group of galaxies next

322
00:13:08,759 --> 00:13:14,958
to the Virgo cluster of 1,500 galaxies

323
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:18,320
part of the Virgo super cluster of

324
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:20,239
50,000 galaxies which makes up the tiny

325
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:21,920
little sliver of the universe that

326
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:25,680
nature allows us to see called the

327
00:13:21,919 --> 00:13:27,759
observable universe and that is your

328
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:31,719
address that's your

329
00:13:27,759 --> 00:13:34,319
address and I by the way think it's high

330
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:36,160
time that every child on this planet is

331
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:38,560
given the opportunity to learn that

332
00:13:36,159 --> 00:13:40,039
address because the human race needs

333
00:13:38,559 --> 00:13:43,278
quite a bit of

334
00:13:40,039 --> 00:13:46,120
humility um a good way to say it is we

335
00:13:43,278 --> 00:13:48,159
all walk around like ships on the

336
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:51,399
ocean at the

337
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:53,519
center of a horizon a personal Horizon

338
00:13:51,399 --> 00:13:55,958
and we have the hubris to say that

339
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:59,560
that's the center of the universe let me

340
00:13:55,958 --> 00:14:02,799
say that again we all walk around dayto

341
00:13:59,559 --> 00:14:05,518
day at just like ships on the ocean at

342
00:14:02,799 --> 00:14:07,198
the center of a personal Horizon we

343
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:09,639
could see out in all directions

344
00:14:07,198 --> 00:14:11,319
uniformly and we have the hubris to

345
00:14:09,639 --> 00:14:13,278
think that that's the center of the

346
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:15,600
universe it's the center of your

347
00:14:13,278 --> 00:14:17,439
universe and I think it's important for

348
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:21,399
us to have a better understanding of

349
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:23,680
Earth in a greater space um so let me

350
00:14:21,399 --> 00:14:26,039
let me now just quickly did you like

351
00:14:23,679 --> 00:14:28,879
that story so far okay let me just

352
00:14:26,039 --> 00:14:30,000
quickly show that to you in photographs

353
00:14:28,879 --> 00:14:32,838
this

354
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,399
is this is the nature of our existence

355
00:14:32,839 --> 00:14:37,800
and if you go above Earth's atmosphere

356
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:40,039
you get to see the The Starry Sky this

357
00:14:37,799 --> 00:14:42,039
uh and one star looks big and bright

358
00:14:40,039 --> 00:14:45,000
that's the sun in a natural context the

359
00:14:42,039 --> 00:14:46,360
sun is just another star it only looks

360
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,519
so big and bright because it's really

361
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:50,399
close and it's a small star a million

362
00:14:48,519 --> 00:14:52,159
Earths can fit inside the Sun a million

363
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:53,679
Earths can fit inside the sun does

364
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:55,559
anybody know the name of that star in

365
00:14:53,679 --> 00:14:59,399
the shoulder of

366
00:14:55,559 --> 00:15:01,359
Orion Beetlejuice 800 million ion Suns

367
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:04,198
fit in the star Beetle

368
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:05,680
Juice 800 million if you put Beetle

369
00:15:04,198 --> 00:15:07,240
Juice where the sun is now we'd be

370
00:15:05,679 --> 00:15:10,000
inside it it would swallow the orbits of

371
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:10,879
Mercury Venus Earth Mars and Jupiter

372
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,440
pretty

373
00:15:10,879 --> 00:15:16,240
cool okay here

374
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:18,320
is a picture of the Earth from space

375
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:21,360
this this spaceship with all known life

376
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:23,680
aboard where water air and land conspire

377
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:25,639
to give rise to life whether it's a

378
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:28,239
bacterium that calls a drop of water

379
00:15:25,639 --> 00:15:31,480
home or a blue whale that calls an ocean

380
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:33,879
ocean a home this spaceship is teeming

381
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:36,680
with life and here is a photograph of

382
00:15:33,879 --> 00:15:38,720
the continental United States and and

383
00:15:36,679 --> 00:15:40,679
what you see is is California is in

384
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:43,040
daylight and there's the Pacific

385
00:15:40,679 --> 00:15:45,399
Nightfall sweeps Westward at about 700

386
00:15:43,039 --> 00:15:47,519
mph at this latitude and in its wake we

387
00:15:45,399 --> 00:15:49,278
can see ourselves the entire Eastern

388
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:52,519
Seaboard lit up with

389
00:15:49,278 --> 00:15:55,360
Humanity that's us at

390
00:15:52,519 --> 00:15:57,600
night and here is a photograph taken not

391
00:15:55,360 --> 00:16:01,000
too long ago a few months ago by the

392
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:04,879
Solar Dynamics of Observatory of the sun

393
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:07,559
burping and that's the actual size of

394
00:16:04,879 --> 00:16:11,198
us and here's a photograph taken by the

395
00:16:07,559 --> 00:16:13,679
messenger spacecraft in January of 2008

396
00:16:11,198 --> 00:16:17,159
as it rounded the side of mercury the

397
00:16:13,679 --> 00:16:20,679
human race had never seen and this craft

398
00:16:17,159 --> 00:16:23,639
came from the earth it came from a tiny

399
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:25,958
little blue World which is right there

400
00:16:23,639 --> 00:16:30,000
that's you from

401
00:16:25,958 --> 00:16:34,399
Mercury and here is uh a photo uh this

402
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:36,318
is a digital image uh of what the vo let

403
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:38,919
me say it differently in February of

404
00:16:36,318 --> 00:16:41,838
1990 the Voyager spacecraft was just

405
00:16:38,919 --> 00:16:44,958
beyond the orbit of Pluto and a

406
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:47,600
Gentleman who you may recognize Carl

407
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:50,078
San suggested that the Voyager

408
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:51,720
spacecraft turn its camera platform back

409
00:16:50,078 --> 00:16:53,679
and image the solar system from the

410
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:55,399
outside or at least outside of the

411
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:57,359
planetary domain for the first time in

412
00:16:55,399 --> 00:16:59,078
history he actually got push back for

413
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:01,639
that but he was successful

414
00:16:59,078 --> 00:17:03,120
and so these are the photos that the

415
00:17:01,639 --> 00:17:05,919
these are these are the orbits of the

416
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:08,480
planets from Voyager vantage point in

417
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:10,360
February of 1990 here are the photos it

418
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:13,558
was going to take to to look at Neptune

419
00:17:10,359 --> 00:17:16,639
and Uranus and Saturn and Mars um and

420
00:17:13,558 --> 00:17:17,558
and Earth is in here um and here are the

421
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,640
actual

422
00:17:17,558 --> 00:17:21,879
photographs and there is Neptune and

423
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:25,240
Uranus and Saturn and Venus Mars was

424
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:27,400
actually not in the photo um uh Jupiter

425
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:32,160
and ladies and gentlemen that's

426
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:34,960
you Voyager is traveling at 40,000 miles

427
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:36,600
an hour that's twice as fast as the

428
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:38,798
International Space Station or the space

429
00:17:36,599 --> 00:17:40,159
shuttle it could orbit the earth it

430
00:17:38,798 --> 00:17:42,759
could go around the earth at that speed

431
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:45,279
in 45 minutes and at this incredible

432
00:17:42,759 --> 00:17:50,038
speed to get to a nearby star will take

433
00:17:45,279 --> 00:17:52,440
80,000 years 880,000 years and that's

434
00:17:50,038 --> 00:17:53,640
just two stars us and a nearby star

435
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:55,919
there are enough stars in the Milky Way

436
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:58,640
galaxy to give 50 to every human being

437
00:17:55,919 --> 00:18:00,038
on planet Earth and we now know that the

438
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:04,280
vast majority of those stars have

439
00:18:00,038 --> 00:18:05,119
planets of them of their own and so this

440
00:18:04,279 --> 00:18:08,279
is

441
00:18:05,119 --> 00:18:10,399
you from from near Earth from from near

442
00:18:08,279 --> 00:18:12,678
space and if you go out into the Milky

443
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:15,200
Way galaxy you see these clouds of gas

444
00:18:12,679 --> 00:18:17,600
and dust from which stars are born

445
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:19,840
called nebula and here are a few Milky

446
00:18:17,599 --> 00:18:21,918
Way stars that get in the photograph and

447
00:18:19,839 --> 00:18:23,599
this is known as the Eagle Nebula and

448
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:27,400
here's a picture up close by the Hubble

449
00:18:23,599 --> 00:18:29,480
Space Telescope of this region here and

450
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:31,280
these little pink things are solar

451
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:33,839
systems that have just been born we're

452
00:18:31,279 --> 00:18:36,519
seeing where we came from this is an

453
00:18:33,839 --> 00:18:39,158
entire solar system planets and star

454
00:18:36,519 --> 00:18:41,119
being born and what I'm about to show

455
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:43,679
you is a photograph in the direction of

456
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:46,558
Sagittarius of the closest star to us

457
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:50,000
proximus inor it's in the very center of

458
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:52,000
the photo and if you take a picture of

459
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,480
proximus centor a few Milky Way stars

460
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,480
get in the

461
00:18:55,558 --> 00:19:00,879
way and you know this is like 50 stars

462
00:18:58,599 --> 00:19:03,959
and this is like 50 stars and 50 stars

463
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:08,159
and 50 stars so how many blocks of 50

464
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:11,319
maybe 15 and 15 across 225 blocks of 50

465
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:14,480
stars this is Enough stars to give 225

466
00:19:11,319 --> 00:19:16,678
people 50 of their very own that's all

467
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:19,440
this is nothing this is less than

468
00:19:16,679 --> 00:19:22,960
nothing and you see that star right

469
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:24,679
there I think somebody's looking back NE

470
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:27,000
next time you look up at the night sky

471
00:19:24,679 --> 00:19:30,240
think about this I firmly believe

472
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,240
somebody's looking back

473
00:19:32,519 --> 00:19:37,038
and this is what we think we would see

474
00:19:34,759 --> 00:19:39,679
if we left our home Galaxy looking in

475
00:19:37,038 --> 00:19:42,839
from the outside this is what 300

476
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:45,159
billion Suns looks like from The Edge

477
00:19:42,839 --> 00:19:47,918
and if you look from above we'd see

478
00:19:45,159 --> 00:19:49,559
something like this it's a spiral galaxy

479
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:52,880
where the spiral arms are the sights of

480
00:19:49,558 --> 00:19:55,879
star formation and

481
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:58,120
this is a really cool photograph because

482
00:19:55,880 --> 00:20:01,640
there's a star because I can see the the

483
00:19:58,119 --> 00:20:04,678
the the the the the the the the spikes

484
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:06,960
over here the crossed spikes

485
00:20:04,679 --> 00:20:08,720
and here's a

486
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:12,000
star

487
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:13,919
and I'm losing sight of any others maybe

488
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,558
this one looks like a star over here

489
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:18,200
what are

490
00:20:15,558 --> 00:20:20,599
these These are

491
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:22,400
galaxies these are all galaxies every

492
00:20:20,599 --> 00:20:24,158
one of these galaxies on average has

493
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,559
enough stars to give 50 to every person

494
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:27,799
on

495
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:29,639
Earth and you know how many galaxies we

496
00:20:27,798 --> 00:20:32,639
think are in the observable

497
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:35,759
universe enough galaxies to give 50

498
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:38,840
galaxies to every person on are you

499
00:20:35,759 --> 00:20:38,839
feeling small

500
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:47,558
yet and here is is another photograph of

501
00:20:44,279 --> 00:20:49,759
galaxies and and so has anybody ever

502
00:20:47,558 --> 00:20:51,158
read Horton her a who by Dr Seuss my

503
00:20:49,759 --> 00:20:54,200
favorite book by

504
00:20:51,159 --> 00:20:55,799
far I say murmured hor Horton I've never

505
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:57,880
heard tell of a small Speck of dust that

506
00:20:55,798 --> 00:20:59,480
is able to yell so you know what I think

507
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:01,720
why I think that there must be someone

508
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:03,960
on top of that small Speck of dust some

509
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:06,440
sort of a creature of very small size

510
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:10,960
too small to be seen by an elephant's

511
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:12,480
eyes we are the who's in hooville and if

512
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:14,480
you read that book you know that the

513
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:16,919
who's were calling out from a speck of

514
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:19,079
dust and Horton was listening with his

515
00:21:16,919 --> 00:21:20,640
with his incredible hearing and he was

516
00:21:19,079 --> 00:21:23,278
having this conversation with The Who

517
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:24,559
and hille the mayor of houille and he

518
00:21:23,278 --> 00:21:26,000
spent the rest of the book trying to

519
00:21:24,558 --> 00:21:28,558
convince the jungle creatures he wasn't

520
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:31,359
a crazy elephant where are the who's in

521
00:21:28,558 --> 00:21:33,759
Whoville and we're calling out to the

522
00:21:31,359 --> 00:21:36,119
rest of the universe not only with

523
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:38,919
spacecraft but ever since Marone turned

524
00:21:36,119 --> 00:21:40,278
on the radio in 1896 radio and then

525
00:21:38,919 --> 00:21:42,679
television have been moving out at the

526
00:21:40,278 --> 00:21:46,319
speed of light and thousands of stars

527
00:21:42,679 --> 00:21:48,240
are now bathed in human signal we're

528
00:21:46,319 --> 00:21:50,839
calling out just like the who's and

529
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:53,798
Whoville and I think

530
00:21:50,839 --> 00:21:57,319
that the real question that that you

531
00:21:53,798 --> 00:22:00,359
have to ask in all of this how did how

532
00:21:57,319 --> 00:22:03,720
did we re reveal all this from this tiny

533
00:22:00,359 --> 00:22:05,278
little world the story that I told you

534
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:07,319
that I started off by saying hey I'm on

535
00:22:05,278 --> 00:22:09,480
the summit of Mona I'm looking out into

536
00:22:07,319 --> 00:22:11,480
majesty and then I Tred to convince you

537
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:14,798
by telling you your address and walking

538
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:20,319
through those images yes it is a a

539
00:22:14,798 --> 00:22:23,079
majestic Universe how did we reveal all

540
00:22:20,319 --> 00:22:25,200
that let me say it a little differently

541
00:22:23,079 --> 00:22:28,558
how did we reveal all that with

542
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:31,080
something the size of this

543
00:22:28,558 --> 00:22:34,079
something the size of this gave rise to

544
00:22:31,079 --> 00:22:38,798
that story where did it come

545
00:22:34,079 --> 00:22:40,480
from what process did we use

546
00:22:38,798 --> 00:22:42,599
exploration

547
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:45,360
exploration what is

548
00:22:42,599 --> 00:22:49,359
exploration what is human exploration

549
00:22:45,359 --> 00:22:52,759
what are the fundamentals of how we

550
00:22:49,359 --> 00:22:55,639
approach pulling back the veil of nature

551
00:22:52,759 --> 00:22:58,278
on any facet of the universe and seeing

552
00:22:55,640 --> 00:23:00,360
how she operates sort of a rhetorical

553
00:22:58,278 --> 00:23:03,759
question not completely

554
00:23:00,359 --> 00:23:06,639
yes asking

555
00:23:03,759 --> 00:23:09,640
questions

556
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:13,120
observation anything else Discovery

557
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:15,400
Discovery curiosity curiosity inqu

558
00:23:13,119 --> 00:23:18,519
inquiry we're just I'm just

559
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:20,519
Fielding words here okay listen to all

560
00:23:18,519 --> 00:23:22,879
these words they're all very powerful

561
00:23:20,519 --> 00:23:22,879
anything

562
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:29,880
else all right let me go on to the next

563
00:23:26,798 --> 00:23:29,879
next chapter

564
00:23:30,319 --> 00:23:34,960
why do we go to

565
00:23:32,079 --> 00:23:38,359
school I'm I'm I'm now going to walk you

566
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:41,240
through my view of how we revealed the

567
00:23:38,359 --> 00:23:43,079
Majesty of the universe that story why

568
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:45,319
do we go to school why do you go to

569
00:23:43,079 --> 00:23:47,879
school think

570
00:23:45,319 --> 00:23:50,119
about kindergarten Elementary School

571
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:54,840
think about college your your college

572
00:23:50,119 --> 00:23:54,839
career here at Cornell why do you go to

573
00:23:56,079 --> 00:23:59,439
school I'm not going to bite I swear I'm

574
00:23:58,359 --> 00:24:02,359
not going to

575
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:05,480
bite there's no wrong answer what to

576
00:24:02,359 --> 00:24:07,359
learn how to learn to learn how to learn

577
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:10,278
I would argue you already know how to

578
00:24:07,359 --> 00:24:13,359
learn it just takes a little bit of

579
00:24:10,278 --> 00:24:15,480
coaxing anybody else why do you go to

580
00:24:13,359 --> 00:24:17,798
school okay here let let me let me

581
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:19,640
switch roles puff I know you're not

582
00:24:17,798 --> 00:24:21,359
going to want want to do this but you're

583
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:23,278
all

584
00:24:21,359 --> 00:24:24,678
parents what are we going to do with the

585
00:24:23,278 --> 00:24:26,798
kids during the

586
00:24:24,679 --> 00:24:29,798
day I

587
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:29,798
know

588
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:35,440
what do your K what do you expect your

589
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:37,440
kids to say in answer to a question why

590
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,960
do you go to

591
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,679
school

592
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:43,000
parents I'm

593
00:24:40,679 --> 00:24:45,600
sorry to make the world a better place

594
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:47,759
that's a great answer I suspect there

595
00:24:45,599 --> 00:24:50,079
are a lot of parents that will not say

596
00:24:47,759 --> 00:24:52,679
that yeah I think parents are going to

597
00:24:50,079 --> 00:24:54,278
think about if from the perspective of

598
00:24:52,679 --> 00:24:56,440
what they consider to be success for

599
00:24:54,278 --> 00:24:58,359
their kids okay what is that what is

600
00:24:56,440 --> 00:25:01,880
that so that they can

601
00:24:58,359 --> 00:25:05,319
essentially make make living get a job

602
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:07,760
to support themselves and their family

603
00:25:05,319 --> 00:25:09,278
who in a sense reproduce the family and

604
00:25:07,759 --> 00:25:12,599
keep

605
00:25:09,278 --> 00:25:14,798
itable so when I go to yeah yes you want

606
00:25:12,599 --> 00:25:17,398
your kids to do better than

607
00:25:14,798 --> 00:25:20,319
you okay that's that's

608
00:25:17,398 --> 00:25:23,398
a that's a profound statement because

609
00:25:20,319 --> 00:25:27,240
it's so far-reaching um but let me tell

610
00:25:23,398 --> 00:25:30,158
you what I hear when I ask elementary

611
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:32,120
and middle school kids that question

612
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:34,799
okay and and try to see whether or not

613
00:25:32,119 --> 00:25:38,879
that extrapolates to your reason for

614
00:25:34,798 --> 00:25:40,720
being here at Cornell kids will say um I

615
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:43,799
want to go to school I need to go to

616
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:46,399
school because Mommy and Daddy say so

617
00:25:43,798 --> 00:25:49,158
that's the first thing you hear I need

618
00:25:46,398 --> 00:25:53,079
to go to school because I have to get

619
00:25:49,159 --> 00:25:54,600
good grades and get a good job because I

620
00:25:53,079 --> 00:25:56,879
have to make

621
00:25:54,599 --> 00:25:59,038
money right and if you get the higher

622
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:01,039
grades well I need money because I want

623
00:25:59,038 --> 00:26:02,319
a car and then you you say well you

624
00:26:01,038 --> 00:26:04,119
you're going to eventually want a family

625
00:26:02,319 --> 00:26:06,240
and you're gonna want to have a mortgage

626
00:26:04,119 --> 00:26:07,639
uh you're going to or or rent and you're

627
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:09,720
you're going to have to put food on the

628
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:13,080
table and that's the reason we go to

629
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:13,079
school do you buy

630
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:20,079
that

631
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:23,159
sure that has absolutely nothing to do

632
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:28,038
in my mind with why we go to school it's

633
00:26:23,159 --> 00:26:31,640
all wrong and let me start off by saying

634
00:26:28,038 --> 00:26:33,599
something maybe profound when we explore

635
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:34,759
we fulfill a commitment of our to our

636
00:26:33,599 --> 00:26:37,759
own

637
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:37,759
Humanity

638
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:44,000
um I don't know you should ask your

639
00:26:41,159 --> 00:26:45,760
parents this I don't I don't know if

640
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,519
you've ever had this conversation with

641
00:26:45,759 --> 00:26:51,359
them but if I were to ask

642
00:26:48,519 --> 00:26:54,119
parents do you remember that magical

643
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:56,719
time when your children were first

644
00:26:54,119 --> 00:27:00,239
starting to express themselves with

645
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:01,880
sentences and as a parent I know what

646
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:03,720
that magical time was like I lived

647
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:05,679
through it with my son you've lived

648
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:07,278
through it with with your daughter I

649
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:09,480
live through it with my daughter that

650
00:27:07,278 --> 00:27:12,038
magical time when they're first able to

651
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:13,919
communicate with you and express

652
00:27:12,038 --> 00:27:16,398
themselves and all parents will remember

653
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:18,240
that time and then you ask what did your

654
00:27:16,398 --> 00:27:20,639
kids do when they first were able to

655
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:23,440
express themselves somebody said it in

656
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:23,440
one of the words

657
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:31,519
before what why which is

658
00:27:28,119 --> 00:27:34,359
a question kids will start asking this

659
00:27:31,519 --> 00:27:36,440
unending stream of questions so many

660
00:27:34,359 --> 00:27:39,439
questions so overwhelming are the

661
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:41,600
questions that adults tend to try to

662
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:44,399
squash it because they they can't handle

663
00:27:41,599 --> 00:27:46,278
all the questions so as soon as we're

664
00:27:44,398 --> 00:27:48,798
capable of expressing

665
00:27:46,278 --> 00:27:51,119
ourselves we ask lots and lots of

666
00:27:48,798 --> 00:27:54,038
questions and I had to change the way I

667
00:27:51,119 --> 00:27:56,798
said this when my son was born because I

668
00:27:54,038 --> 00:27:59,278
remember I was in a family room with my

669
00:27:56,798 --> 00:28:01,839
son who uh and this was before he was

670
00:27:59,278 --> 00:28:04,079
able to to speak he just knew a couple

671
00:28:01,839 --> 00:28:06,439
of words that's it but he was an Avid

672
00:28:04,079 --> 00:28:08,240
Reader and the reason I say that is we

673
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:09,960
had this incredible library of picture

674
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:12,240
books do you remember those big format

675
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:14,278
picture books where like every tree

676
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:15,599
imaginable was on these pages in the

677
00:28:14,278 --> 00:28:18,038
tree book and then there was the car

678
00:28:15,599 --> 00:28:19,719
book and the truck book and I remember

679
00:28:18,038 --> 00:28:23,038
this this moment in time when we were

680
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:26,200
sitting on the family room couch and I

681
00:28:23,038 --> 00:28:29,798
think it was I think it was um a the

682
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:31,399
fish book and he I turned the page and

683
00:28:29,798 --> 00:28:34,240
he pulled the page back and he looked at

684
00:28:31,398 --> 00:28:36,839
me he went da and I didn't know what he

685
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:38,759
was saying so I turned the page again

686
00:28:36,839 --> 00:28:42,839
and he pulled the P the page back hard

687
00:28:38,759 --> 00:28:43,919
and he went da da and then I again I

688
00:28:42,839 --> 00:28:46,000
didn't know what he was saying so I

689
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:48,480
turned the page and he pulled the page

690
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,558
back really hard and he pointed to a

691
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:52,679
particular picture I can't remember what

692
00:28:50,558 --> 00:28:56,759
the fish was let's let's say it was a

693
00:28:52,679 --> 00:29:00,278
tuna I don't know and he said da da and

694
00:28:56,759 --> 00:29:01,720
I looked down and I said a tuna and he

695
00:29:00,278 --> 00:29:05,640
turned the

696
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:08,360
page and so what he was saying is Daddy

697
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:11,278
what is this before he even had the

698
00:29:08,359 --> 00:29:13,639
ability to express that to say what is

699
00:29:11,278 --> 00:29:16,679
this he was asking

700
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:19,320
questions we're born to explore we're

701
00:29:16,679 --> 00:29:22,720
born curious we've got to do it because

702
00:29:19,319 --> 00:29:24,480
what it it's what it means to be human

703
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:26,600
and we're also born with something else

704
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:28,200
so we're born curious we're born to ask

705
00:29:26,599 --> 00:29:29,480
those questions we're born

706
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:32,399
evidence-based

707
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:35,000
Learners what does that mean well we are

708
00:29:32,398 --> 00:29:37,678
born to poke the universe and see what

709
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:40,720
happens we love to poke the universe and

710
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:43,640
see what happens and a great example of

711
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:45,720
a class of humans that poke the universe

712
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:48,440
really really well are

713
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:50,880
babies a baby will poke the universe in

714
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:53,558
every way it can it will explore near

715
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:56,679
versus far and up versus down texture

716
00:29:53,558 --> 00:29:59,319
and color and sound a baby will try to

717
00:29:56,679 --> 00:30:02,440
figure out how to to bring that glass of

718
00:29:59,319 --> 00:30:05,079
juice in a way so that the surface

719
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:07,880
remains horizontal until the the the

720
00:30:05,079 --> 00:30:10,079
child can get the glass to their mouth

721
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:12,600
and then drink it think about the

722
00:30:10,079 --> 00:30:15,720
articulation in in in the fingers and

723
00:30:12,599 --> 00:30:19,119
the wrist and the elbow and the shoulder

724
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:21,000
to make all that happen and the act of

725
00:30:19,119 --> 00:30:23,639
poking the universe and seeing what

726
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:25,440
happens gives rise to two things first

727
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:28,720
of all it tells us how the universe

728
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:30,320
works and the second thing does is it

729
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:33,399
tells us how to interact with the

730
00:30:30,319 --> 00:30:36,480
universe we learn how to interact with

731
00:30:33,398 --> 00:30:39,678
it because of the evidence it presents

732
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:41,759
to us so that's really really important

733
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:44,519
we are born curious and we are born

734
00:30:41,759 --> 00:30:44,519
evidence-based

735
00:30:45,839 --> 00:30:51,839
Learners

736
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:54,720
so let me start back with

737
00:30:51,839 --> 00:30:57,439
that first part let me let me let me not

738
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:59,278
say that give the answer away not

739
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:01,679
knowing something is a

740
00:30:59,278 --> 00:31:04,839
gift

741
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:06,720
why can explore it for ourselves and

742
00:31:04,839 --> 00:31:07,839
have fun doing it and how do you start

743
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:10,679
that

744
00:31:07,839 --> 00:31:14,000
exploration by asking what it is we

745
00:31:10,679 --> 00:31:17,240
don't know asking uh question question

746
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:18,839
right not knowing something is really a

747
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:21,399
remarkable gift because if you don't

748
00:31:18,839 --> 00:31:24,558
know something you can ask a question

749
00:31:21,398 --> 00:31:28,239
and have a journey that's what it's all

750
00:31:24,558 --> 00:31:30,720
about and I guess the the only caveat is

751
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:33,399
that you want to know it by the time the

752
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:33,399
exam rolls

753
00:31:34,398 --> 00:31:38,479
around so the act of Journey the start

754
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:41,278
of

755
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:43,798
Journey is is is brought about by asking

756
00:31:41,278 --> 00:31:46,119
a question and so let me give you some

757
00:31:43,798 --> 00:31:47,638
examples of the Majesty in a question

758
00:31:46,119 --> 00:31:50,759
there are common themes here I Ed the

759
00:31:47,638 --> 00:31:53,719
word majesty a few few times sparingly

760
00:31:50,759 --> 00:31:56,119
there is Majesty in a question and I was

761
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:57,839
doing a professional development with

762
00:31:56,119 --> 00:32:01,359
Zoo staff

763
00:31:57,839 --> 00:32:03,720
at the National Zoo in Washington DC and

764
00:32:01,359 --> 00:32:06,240
we were talking about this and Roger

765
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:08,558
Rosco who is a curator in the reptile

766
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:11,000
house said Jeff I know what you're

767
00:32:08,558 --> 00:32:14,158
talking about because there was one

768
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:16,398
question that drove drove everything I

769
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:18,760
did as as a as a kid when I wanted to go

770
00:32:16,398 --> 00:32:20,319
out and explore and I said well Roger

771
00:32:18,759 --> 00:32:22,038
what was that question he said I wonder

772
00:32:20,319 --> 00:32:24,519
what's under that

773
00:32:22,038 --> 00:32:26,278
rock and so this was the question that

774
00:32:24,519 --> 00:32:28,278
drove him I wonder what's under that

775
00:32:26,278 --> 00:32:31,079
rock and he would go and he would he

776
00:32:28,278 --> 00:32:33,440
would Empower himself as a learner to

777
00:32:31,079 --> 00:32:34,839
lift up a rock and see creatures that he

778
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:36,880
never would have seen if he didn't ask

779
00:32:34,839 --> 00:32:38,918
the question this Brave New World of

780
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:41,159
creatures that live under the Rock and

781
00:32:38,919 --> 00:32:44,360
don't want to come out in daylight and

782
00:32:41,159 --> 00:32:46,880
so with a smile breaking across his face

783
00:32:44,359 --> 00:32:48,479
you know what he did next Rock he said I

784
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:50,519
wonder what's under that rock and this

785
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:52,240
rock and that rock and after he he' done

786
00:32:50,519 --> 00:32:53,798
he done had done that with all the rocks

787
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:56,480
in his backyard he moved over to the

788
00:32:53,798 --> 00:33:01,638
park I mean this is what he told me and

789
00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:04,319
that that love of of exploring the the

790
00:33:01,638 --> 00:33:06,038
world translated professionally into he

791
00:33:04,319 --> 00:33:08,960
became a curator at the reptile house at

792
00:33:06,038 --> 00:33:10,879
the national Zoological Park and I said

793
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:12,639
to Roger at the time well that's really

794
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:14,080
cool because when I was in elementary

795
00:33:12,638 --> 00:33:16,038
school there was a question like that

796
00:33:14,079 --> 00:33:19,038
that I used to ask I wonder what's in

797
00:33:16,038 --> 00:33:20,839
that rock and I took my dad's hammer and

798
00:33:19,038 --> 00:33:22,240
I would whack away at rocks and it was

799
00:33:20,839 --> 00:33:23,959
like on the outside they would be brown

800
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:26,359
or gray and inside hey this is really

801
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:28,240
cool there's Quartz in here and I'd go

802
00:33:26,359 --> 00:33:30,398
to the museum and I would see geodes do

803
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:32,120
you have you ever seen geod and it's

804
00:33:30,398 --> 00:33:33,719
like I would just whack rocks all over

805
00:33:32,119 --> 00:33:35,638
the place and I had this this rock

806
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:38,240
collection which I probably still have

807
00:33:35,638 --> 00:33:41,158
it's somewhere in a box somewhere and

808
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:43,359
and I know I've told that story stories

809
00:33:41,159 --> 00:33:45,159
to that story to a number of geologist

810
00:33:43,359 --> 00:33:48,240
who said that's how I got involved in

811
00:33:45,159 --> 00:33:50,320
geology whacking Rocks open think about

812
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:52,679
another question and and some of the

813
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:56,278
most powerful questions are are the most

814
00:33:52,679 --> 00:33:58,159
elegant how far can I see so on a clear

815
00:33:56,278 --> 00:34:01,359
day if you're out in an open field how

816
00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:01,360
far can you see what do you

817
00:34:02,278 --> 00:34:08,519
think few miles a few

818
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:10,398
miles yes you agree with that well wait

819
00:34:08,519 --> 00:34:13,878
can you see the

820
00:34:10,398 --> 00:34:14,918
Moon that's 240,000 miles away can you

821
00:34:13,878 --> 00:34:18,878
see the

822
00:34:14,918 --> 00:34:20,279
sun that's 93 million miles away that

823
00:34:18,878 --> 00:34:21,759
star Beetlejuice in the in the

824
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:24,399
constellation of Orion which you could

825
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:27,240
see from any urban area because it's so

826
00:34:24,398 --> 00:34:29,759
bright that's 500 light years away one

827
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:32,719
lightyear is six trillion miles that's

828
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:34,520
500 time 6 trillion is 3,000 trillion

829
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:36,319
miles and that's a nearby

830
00:34:34,519 --> 00:34:38,239
star if you're in the southern

831
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:40,280
hemisphere you can see the large and and

832
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:42,078
the the large and small magelan clouds

833
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:44,040
two neighboring galaxies and if you know

834
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:46,800
where to look you can see the center of

835
00:34:44,039 --> 00:34:48,599
the Andromeda galaxy the nearest large

836
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:51,639
galaxy to the Milky Way and you're

837
00:34:48,599 --> 00:34:54,079
looking 2 million light years away that

838
00:34:51,639 --> 00:34:56,039
light started traveling to us two

839
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:58,880
million years ago and is only getting to

840
00:34:56,039 --> 00:35:01,679
us now you can see really

841
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:05,280
far and so that one question how far can

842
00:35:01,679 --> 00:35:08,159
I see provides this pathway for a

843
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:09,720
journey of Discovery that's stunning

844
00:35:08,159 --> 00:35:11,319
it's absolutely

845
00:35:09,719 --> 00:35:15,078
stunning

846
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:17,559
so a question is really really powerful

847
00:35:15,079 --> 00:35:20,599
and here's something that I think ought

848
00:35:17,559 --> 00:35:23,759
to be an appropriate reminder to any

849
00:35:20,599 --> 00:35:25,359
adult okay next time a child comes at

850
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:27,320
you with question after question

851
00:35:25,358 --> 00:35:30,119
consider it a gift

852
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:30,119
because they chose

853
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:38,358
you you're helping the next generation

854
00:35:33,838 --> 00:35:40,559
of Explorer fulfill their commitment to

855
00:35:38,358 --> 00:35:43,559
their own

856
00:35:40,559 --> 00:35:46,599
Humanity people are taking

857
00:35:43,559 --> 00:35:48,719
notes follow me on

858
00:35:46,599 --> 00:35:50,838
Twitter you can see many of these are

859
00:35:48,719 --> 00:35:52,559
short enough for 140 characters there's

860
00:35:50,838 --> 00:35:55,799
a reason for

861
00:35:52,559 --> 00:35:58,799
that how do you answer a

862
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:58,800
question

863
00:35:59,318 --> 00:36:03,480
question well will that give you an

864
00:36:01,719 --> 00:36:06,598
answer if you answer a question with a

865
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:09,199
question well okay how would you answer

866
00:36:06,599 --> 00:36:12,680
sophisticated audience a

867
00:36:09,199 --> 00:36:12,679
question you'd go

868
00:36:13,239 --> 00:36:21,000
to Google or Bing right but wait a

869
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:23,519
second is that how you answer the

870
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:25,719
question or is that evees dropping on in

871
00:36:23,519 --> 00:36:29,800
on somebody else's answer to that

872
00:36:25,719 --> 00:36:33,159
question how do you answer the

873
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:36,680
question you poke the universe you've

874
00:36:33,159 --> 00:36:38,920
got to find a creative way to interact

875
00:36:36,679 --> 00:36:41,358
with the universe and in the case of my

876
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:42,960
field astronomy it's really cool because

877
00:36:41,358 --> 00:36:45,559
light from all of those things that we

878
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:47,119
were talking about before is streaming

879
00:36:45,559 --> 00:36:51,838
to the Earth and the Earth gets in the

880
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:53,680
way and that light falls without any

881
00:36:51,838 --> 00:36:56,318
importance on the surface of the Earth

882
00:36:53,679 --> 00:36:57,879
and it's gone but if you poke the univer

883
00:36:56,318 --> 00:37:00,039
if you interact with the universe by

884
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:01,720
putting large light buckets in in in

885
00:37:00,039 --> 00:37:03,920
front of the light streaming in we call

886
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:05,679
them telescopes and you collect the

887
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:07,318
light and you're smart enough to

888
00:37:05,679 --> 00:37:10,000
understand the information contained in

889
00:37:07,318 --> 00:37:12,759
the light you can find out how far and

890
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:14,639
how bright and how big and whether the

891
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:16,960
winds are circulating on the atmosphere

892
00:37:14,639 --> 00:37:19,358
of a planet far far

893
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:21,280
away so how do you answer answer a

894
00:37:19,358 --> 00:37:23,759
question you've got to interact with the

895
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:27,599
universe now I think what I'm trying to

896
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:30,079
say here is that

897
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:32,960
what we know standing on the shoulders

898
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:36,280
of past Generations have has come to us

899
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:40,039
because we have found creative ways to

900
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:40,960
explore and what we're doing when we're

901
00:37:40,039 --> 00:37:44,400
just

902
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:47,039
children is naturally exploring we're

903
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:49,440
not we're not learning how to learn we

904
00:37:47,039 --> 00:37:52,159
already know how to learn babies know

905
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:54,838
how to learn what we really need is is

906
00:37:52,159 --> 00:37:56,920
is a little guidance it's sort of like

907
00:37:54,838 --> 00:37:58,759
it's the students classroom and the

908
00:37:56,920 --> 00:38:00,838
teacher lights the

909
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:03,079
way okay it's not the teachers's

910
00:38:00,838 --> 00:38:05,119
classroom it never was never me was

911
00:38:03,079 --> 00:38:07,079
never meant to be the teacher classroom

912
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:11,400
it's the students classroom and the

913
00:38:07,079 --> 00:38:14,400
teacher lights the way the idea is that

914
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:16,519
we know how to learn we know how to poke

915
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:18,639
the universe we know how to ask

916
00:38:16,519 --> 00:38:20,759
questions we know how to frame a pathway

917
00:38:18,639 --> 00:38:23,118
to an answer but sometimes you need to

918
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:26,960
heard heard the cats a little bit to to

919
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:29,039
provide the tools that will allow to be

920
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:31,920
a very efficient

921
00:38:29,039 --> 00:38:35,159
exploration

922
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:37,200
so what is science because you know I've

923
00:38:35,159 --> 00:38:39,358
talked about what what it's what it

924
00:38:37,199 --> 00:38:42,318
means to be human in terms of

925
00:38:39,358 --> 00:38:45,279
exploration what is science because

926
00:38:42,318 --> 00:38:49,318
formally science is what revealed the

927
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:49,319
Majesty of the universe what is

928
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:55,838
science if you ask scientists and

929
00:38:53,358 --> 00:38:58,519
Engineers what do you do what would they

930
00:38:55,838 --> 00:38:58,519
say

931
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:06,318
the art of generating new questions from

932
00:39:03,519 --> 00:39:06,318
old questions

933
00:39:07,318 --> 00:39:10,679
or way of

934
00:39:12,199 --> 00:39:15,919
knowing how is that different than what

935
00:39:14,318 --> 00:39:19,960
we've just been talking about in terms

936
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:23,240
of human nature in terms of

937
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:23,240
exploration it's

938
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:30,559
not

939
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:35,119
I like that can we use that on

940
00:39:30,559 --> 00:39:36,920
Twitter um you know what science is it's

941
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:40,400
organized

942
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:42,680
curiosity it's organized curiosity and

943
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:44,480
you know what science is it's

944
00:39:42,679 --> 00:39:46,078
evidence-based learning for the entire

945
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:48,440
human

946
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:50,760
race it's evidence-based learning for

947
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:54,079
the entire human race

948
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:57,560
science grows organically from what it

949
00:39:54,079 --> 00:40:00,800
means to be human we're born

950
00:39:57,559 --> 00:40:03,679
curious organize it you get science

951
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:07,480
we're evidence-based Learners organize

952
00:40:03,679 --> 00:40:11,159
that into a process by which you can can

953
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:14,199
really put evidence to the test you get

954
00:40:11,159 --> 00:40:16,799
science think about it I'm a scientist I

955
00:40:14,199 --> 00:40:18,598
go and I find out something new I'm

956
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:21,519
really excited about this new thing I

957
00:40:18,599 --> 00:40:23,559
found I tell all of my colleagues

958
00:40:21,519 --> 00:40:25,679
through scholarly Publications and at

959
00:40:23,559 --> 00:40:29,000
conferences I tell all my colleagues

960
00:40:25,679 --> 00:40:32,199
about what I found they say I don't

961
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:34,838
believe you Jeff you know what I

962
00:40:32,199 --> 00:40:37,318
say well you poke the universe the same

963
00:40:34,838 --> 00:40:40,400
way and see what you

964
00:40:37,318 --> 00:40:43,440
find that's what science is it's a

965
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:44,599
torture test you you you make your

966
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:46,159
evidence you know you're an

967
00:40:44,599 --> 00:40:47,720
evidence-based learner you've you've

968
00:40:46,159 --> 00:40:50,199
figured out what the evidence is you've

969
00:40:47,719 --> 00:40:53,239
presented it in scholarly Publications

970
00:40:50,199 --> 00:40:55,358
and now you you invite the entire C

971
00:40:53,239 --> 00:40:57,759
scientific Community to throw darts at

972
00:40:55,358 --> 00:41:00,719
it and and you know what happens

973
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:02,800
sometimes you find out you were wrong

974
00:41:00,719 --> 00:41:04,559
and you know what happens sometimes

975
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:06,760
everybody finds out the same thing and

976
00:41:04,559 --> 00:41:08,159
it's it's it's like the whole world goes

977
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:09,720
to a whole new

978
00:41:08,159 --> 00:41:12,799
place

979
00:41:09,719 --> 00:41:14,719
so science as I said is a natural

980
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:17,039
outgrowth of what it means to be human

981
00:41:14,719 --> 00:41:21,039
so the next logical question in this

982
00:41:17,039 --> 00:41:24,480
story is what should Science Education

983
00:41:21,039 --> 00:41:27,039
be there's a pathway I'm I'm I'm getting

984
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:29,838
to a point here and and let go back to

985
00:41:27,039 --> 00:41:33,199
something I said earlier which is

986
00:41:29,838 --> 00:41:36,199
that the process by which we ask a

987
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:38,199
question and the art by which we frame a

988
00:41:36,199 --> 00:41:41,000
pathway through the noise of the

989
00:41:38,199 --> 00:41:43,639
universe around us in quest of an

990
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:45,318
answer and the act of pulling back the

991
00:41:43,639 --> 00:41:48,838
veil of Nature and seeing something

992
00:41:45,318 --> 00:41:50,800
wholly new and the joy that breaks over

993
00:41:48,838 --> 00:41:53,400
your your you know breaks across your

994
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:56,640
face when you see something holy new is

995
00:41:53,400 --> 00:42:00,920
science where was I going with this ah

996
00:41:56,639 --> 00:42:04,358
Science Education well that process you

997
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:06,240
know in an organized way or you know is

998
00:42:04,358 --> 00:42:08,239
is the scientific you know well let me

999
00:42:06,239 --> 00:42:11,358
say it a little differently that process

1000
00:42:08,239 --> 00:42:14,639
is the scientific method and it's an art

1001
00:42:11,358 --> 00:42:16,598
form it is not a rigid recipe for do

1002
00:42:14,639 --> 00:42:18,400
this do this do this do this I could

1003
00:42:16,599 --> 00:42:20,960
tell you that two scientists approaching

1004
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:22,960
the same problem okay may go at it

1005
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:24,440
completely different ways and one

1006
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:26,318
scientist approaching two different

1007
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:27,440
problems well they may go at it too

1008
00:42:26,318 --> 00:42:29,558
different ways because the problem

1009
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:31,760
demands it and I can tell you there are

1010
00:42:29,559 --> 00:42:32,920
scientist that will not hypothesize to

1011
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:36,000
begin with because they don't want to

1012
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:38,159
bias the results lots of science is done

1013
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:40,119
by poking it and just seeing what

1014
00:42:38,159 --> 00:42:42,318
happens so the scientific method I think

1015
00:42:40,119 --> 00:42:44,440
we do a very bad job in teaching in in

1016
00:42:42,318 --> 00:42:46,199
classrooms but the the more important

1017
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:48,720
thing is that process of exploration and

1018
00:42:46,199 --> 00:42:50,318
learning that I described is that

1019
00:42:48,719 --> 00:42:52,279
science

1020
00:42:50,318 --> 00:42:55,079
specific what about history if you want

1021
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:57,920
to learn about the Civil War okay

1022
00:42:55,079 --> 00:43:01,000
instead of paring facts and information

1023
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:03,519
here memorize all of this stuff okay or

1024
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:06,599
or let's say Truman okay the decision to

1025
00:43:03,519 --> 00:43:08,358
drop the bomb okay instead of of a bunch

1026
00:43:06,599 --> 00:43:11,800
of facts and figures to memorize for the

1027
00:43:08,358 --> 00:43:14,318
exam exam your Truman and his Joint

1028
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:16,400
Chiefs of Staff and his cabinet that's

1029
00:43:14,318 --> 00:43:19,480
who you are you're making the decision

1030
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:21,519
to drop the bomb what is it that you

1031
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:24,559
would need to consider in other words

1032
00:43:21,519 --> 00:43:26,599
you can put students in the moment

1033
00:43:24,559 --> 00:43:29,640
provide them a problem in history

1034
00:43:26,599 --> 00:43:33,200
and history becomes alive it becomes

1035
00:43:29,639 --> 00:43:35,639
something that is more organic and so I

1036
00:43:33,199 --> 00:43:37,759
think what I'm saying is that process

1037
00:43:35,639 --> 00:43:39,759
that I'm describing here is the way

1038
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:42,359
humans like to learn it's the way we're

1039
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:45,319
born to learn and it's discipline

1040
00:43:42,358 --> 00:43:49,838
independent and so therefore my question

1041
00:43:45,318 --> 00:43:52,159
becomes how then should education be

1042
00:43:49,838 --> 00:43:54,480
conducted so that it's Effective

1043
00:43:52,159 --> 00:43:55,598
Education you know what should and I'll

1044
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:57,719
give you the example of Science

1045
00:43:55,599 --> 00:43:59,800
Education what should Science Education

1046
00:43:57,719 --> 00:44:01,799
be what are the what is the nature of

1047
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:05,519
Science Education if it's going to be

1048
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:06,880
effective and so let me um let me take

1049
00:44:05,519 --> 00:44:09,119
you through a couple of other things my

1050
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:11,760
thoughts on education some some of my

1051
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:13,680
thoughts on educ uh education a question

1052
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:16,480
we should be asking but don't what is

1053
00:44:13,679 --> 00:44:19,480
the role of Education you tell me what's

1054
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:23,440
education all about what's the point of

1055
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:23,440
Education what's the point of going to

1056
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:28,760
Cornell what what is the the set of of

1057
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:30,519
objectives that you're trying to meet

1058
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:33,119
and I'm not talking about you know

1059
00:44:30,519 --> 00:44:35,440
Downstream the job the diploma the

1060
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:37,880
education what's the point I I'll give

1061
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:40,079
you a hint here's a here's a tweet I put

1062
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:41,599
out that went viral student why do I

1063
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:43,039
have to learn all this stuff system

1064
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:44,880
because we want you to get a good job as

1065
00:44:43,039 --> 00:44:48,960
a search

1066
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:48,960
engine what do what do I mean by

1067
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:54,920
that did did I'm

1068
00:44:52,199 --> 00:44:57,078
sorry you can find all that stuff online

1069
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:58,760
you find that all so so it's important

1070
00:44:57,079 --> 00:45:00,800
for you to know all of the state

1071
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:04,160
capitals by the time say you're 10

1072
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:06,920
because that information is hard to come

1073
00:45:04,159 --> 00:45:09,519
by how many of you in your you know

1074
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:11,680
you've gone through a a a k through 12

1075
00:45:09,519 --> 00:45:14,960
education system how many of you

1076
00:45:11,679 --> 00:45:18,318
remember subjects where the educational

1077
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:20,400
experience was memorizing

1078
00:45:18,318 --> 00:45:22,440
information how do you feel in the age

1079
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:25,639
of

1080
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:27,880
Google you know it's like 10 minutes

1081
00:45:25,639 --> 00:45:28,759
okay um I I actually saw that that's

1082
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:30,880
good that's good you didn't have to

1083
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:32,920
throw anything okay um you know what's

1084
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:35,440
interesting is I used to tell students

1085
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:38,240
uh years ago I I'd go into a classroom

1086
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:41,318
and they wanted me to talk about um

1087
00:45:38,239 --> 00:45:44,318
careers and you know how I made my

1088
00:45:41,318 --> 00:45:46,440
decisions and what I did and I used to

1089
00:45:44,318 --> 00:45:49,000
say something that I now kind of sort of

1090
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:52,760
regret I used to say to students you

1091
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:56,400
know knowledge is power the more you

1092
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:58,559
know the more capable you are to decide

1093
00:45:56,400 --> 00:46:00,119
what you want to do with your life so

1094
00:45:58,559 --> 00:46:03,200
school is really really important you

1095
00:46:00,119 --> 00:46:05,079
got to know you know as much as you can

1096
00:46:03,199 --> 00:46:07,318
that's really not right that's not

1097
00:46:05,079 --> 00:46:10,079
correct what what happens if all of a

1098
00:46:07,318 --> 00:46:12,639
sudden somebody finds this humongous

1099
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:14,079
deposit of gold what will happen to the

1100
00:46:12,639 --> 00:46:17,039
value of

1101
00:46:14,079 --> 00:46:18,280
gold go down it'll plummet because

1102
00:46:17,039 --> 00:46:21,079
there's a lot of

1103
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:23,240
it well look at Google look at the

1104
00:46:21,079 --> 00:46:25,599
information age look at look at the

1105
00:46:23,239 --> 00:46:27,479
knowledge base of the human race online

1106
00:46:25,599 --> 00:46:29,359
and you know in the not too distant

1107
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:30,760
future I'm sure a couple of generations

1108
00:46:29,358 --> 00:46:34,199
from now you're going to be able to plug

1109
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:36,160
your brain into the human knowledge base

1110
00:46:34,199 --> 00:46:38,039
and what then of

1111
00:46:36,159 --> 00:46:41,279
Education

1112
00:46:38,039 --> 00:46:43,318
um knowledge and and let me say this for

1113
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:44,960
effect I don't believe it to the depth

1114
00:46:43,318 --> 00:46:47,558
of what I'm about to say but I'm I'll

1115
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:49,400
say it for effect just to make the point

1116
00:46:47,559 --> 00:46:51,359
knowledge is virtually

1117
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:53,800
useless it's

1118
00:46:51,358 --> 00:46:56,119
everywhere you know we were we were

1119
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:58,720
driving in the car and we were talking

1120
00:46:56,119 --> 00:47:00,720
about William Penn in Philadelphia and

1121
00:46:58,719 --> 00:47:03,000
we were having this debate well William

1122
00:47:00,719 --> 00:47:05,639
Penn must be like you know 5 10 stories

1123
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:08,838
high and I pulled out my iPhone 5 and

1124
00:47:05,639 --> 00:47:10,920
it's like 547 feet high William Penn is

1125
00:47:08,838 --> 00:47:13,239
54 stories up in Philadelphia that's

1126
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:16,480
like incredible it's like I have the

1127
00:47:13,239 --> 00:47:18,879
power at my fingertips to probe the the

1128
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:22,000
the knowledge base of the human race and

1129
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:25,400
so the power doesn't lie in how much you

1130
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:27,559
know the power lies in your ability to

1131
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:30,400
do something with the

1132
00:47:27,559 --> 00:47:33,119
knowledge what's power is your ability

1133
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:33,960
to use the knowledge to do something

1134
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:37,200
with the

1135
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:41,000
knowledge and actually that's true in in

1136
00:47:37,199 --> 00:47:42,558
virtually every field um a bold

1137
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:44,119
statement when it comes to education we

1138
00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:46,319
must stop telling our children that

1139
00:47:44,119 --> 00:47:51,400
knowledge is power and we just talked

1140
00:47:46,318 --> 00:47:54,039
about that and and so it's not about the

1141
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:56,800
information knowled education is not

1142
00:47:54,039 --> 00:47:58,759
should not be about the information

1143
00:47:56,800 --> 00:48:00,599
and over here education must not be

1144
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:02,400
about dictating to our children what

1145
00:48:00,599 --> 00:48:04,640
they should be curious

1146
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:07,079
about you you know what's really

1147
00:48:04,639 --> 00:48:09,598
reprehensible forcing a child to sit in

1148
00:48:07,079 --> 00:48:12,440
a classroom for 6 hours and telling them

1149
00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:14,599
what they should be curious about that

1150
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:18,599
denies them I think I said it on the

1151
00:48:14,599 --> 00:48:20,640
next slide here it is okay education

1152
00:48:18,599 --> 00:48:22,280
that denies our children their curiosity

1153
00:48:20,639 --> 00:48:24,358
and their need to poke the universe is

1154
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:26,920
not education worthy of our

1155
00:48:24,358 --> 00:48:28,480
children it's the it's the students

1156
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:31,760
classroom not the teachers the teacher

1157
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:35,079
lights the way and if we take away

1158
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:37,720
ownership and learning from the child

1159
00:48:35,079 --> 00:48:41,519
what we are doing is denying them their

1160
00:48:37,719 --> 00:48:43,919
need to be

1161
00:48:41,519 --> 00:48:45,960
explorers and there are ways the ways to

1162
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:48,798
do this what I'm asking what I'm what

1163
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:52,000
I'm suggesting here is not difficult to

1164
00:48:48,798 --> 00:48:53,679
do so going back to what is innately

1165
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:55,880
human the journey is written in our

1166
00:48:53,679 --> 00:48:58,838
genes The Book of Knowledge is not what

1167
00:48:55,880 --> 00:49:02,680
should that tell us about the role of

1168
00:48:58,838 --> 00:49:05,039
Education okay let's go by go back to

1169
00:49:02,679 --> 00:49:08,000
biology the journey is written in our

1170
00:49:05,039 --> 00:49:10,440
genes do we have to teach our children

1171
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:13,318
those those CH those those those babies

1172
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:16,200
for instance how to explore their

1173
00:49:13,318 --> 00:49:19,199
Universe the journey the process of

1174
00:49:16,199 --> 00:49:21,558
inquiry and exploration is written into

1175
00:49:19,199 --> 00:49:23,078
our genes The Book of Knowledge is not

1176
00:49:21,559 --> 00:49:27,519
so what should that tell you about

1177
00:49:23,079 --> 00:49:27,519
education how education should proceed

1178
00:49:29,199 --> 00:49:33,318
shouldn't it be nurturing what is

1179
00:49:31,838 --> 00:49:36,358
already in

1180
00:49:33,318 --> 00:49:39,798
US shouldn't it be about nurturing the

1181
00:49:36,358 --> 00:49:42,400
gift of a question and and inquiry based

1182
00:49:39,798 --> 00:49:45,318
exploration shouldn't it be about

1183
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:48,920
recognizing that there is core knowledge

1184
00:49:45,318 --> 00:49:51,639
to let me say it this way when you ask a

1185
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:55,599
question if you understand how to play

1186
00:49:51,639 --> 00:49:57,719
the game the art of of of learning you

1187
00:49:55,599 --> 00:50:00,480
recognize that there is core knowledge

1188
00:49:57,719 --> 00:50:03,519
that you need to bring to the problem at

1189
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:05,639
hand and there is core knowledge that we

1190
00:50:03,519 --> 00:50:08,119
ought to be teaching our children basic

1191
00:50:05,639 --> 00:50:12,679
conceptual underpinnings across the

1192
00:50:08,119 --> 00:50:15,838
board and then you find a pathway to

1193
00:50:12,679 --> 00:50:19,078
address that question and the answer is

1194
00:50:15,838 --> 00:50:21,639
the creation of new knowledge the

1195
00:50:19,079 --> 00:50:24,480
objective ought to be the a student's

1196
00:50:21,639 --> 00:50:26,400
ability to go through that process and

1197
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:28,280
create new knowledge at least new

1198
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:31,280
knowledge to

1199
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:35,200
them um

1200
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:37,400
so education and the title of the talk

1201
00:50:35,199 --> 00:50:40,199
was a teacher's gift uh nurturing

1202
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:43,599
education in our children what education

1203
00:50:40,199 --> 00:50:45,879
ought to be about is that nurturing of

1204
00:50:43,599 --> 00:50:48,280
exploration in our children nurturing

1205
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:51,079
exploration in our children now let me

1206
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:54,040
give you some some examples okay and

1207
00:50:51,079 --> 00:50:57,640
maybe this is on the next slide

1208
00:50:54,039 --> 00:51:00,159
um what do I I want to say uh let's go

1209
00:50:57,639 --> 00:51:03,440
to the next slide it's been a long day

1210
00:51:00,159 --> 00:51:05,598
already okay okay well I didn't get to

1211
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:07,039
the other slide but yeah education needs

1212
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:10,838
to be about

1213
00:51:07,039 --> 00:51:13,880
Journey it needs to be about

1214
00:51:10,838 --> 00:51:16,039
process and what are the skills required

1215
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:17,760
ownership and learning critical thinking

1216
00:51:16,039 --> 00:51:20,440
problem solving navigation of an

1217
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:22,400
interdisciplinary landscape teamwork

1218
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:24,559
ownership and learning is so important

1219
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:25,760
it's like you know here's an example for

1220
00:51:24,559 --> 00:51:28,119
you know Elementary pres school

1221
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:30,640
generalists um you know it's like are

1222
00:51:28,119 --> 00:51:33,160
you telling me that you want me to to

1223
00:51:30,639 --> 00:51:35,400
allow unfettered exploration of my my

1224
00:51:33,159 --> 00:51:38,118
science class letting all of the the

1225
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:40,280
students go and do whatever they want

1226
00:51:38,119 --> 00:51:42,640
and I I understand that problem um and I

1227
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:45,798
can tell you when I was building the the

1228
00:51:42,639 --> 00:51:47,318
the uh carbon monoxide uh carbon dioxide

1229
00:51:45,798 --> 00:51:50,358
laser system for the heterodon

1230
00:51:47,318 --> 00:51:52,039
spectrometer no Divine hand gave me the

1231
00:51:50,358 --> 00:51:54,519
procedures on how to build it nor would

1232
00:51:52,039 --> 00:51:56,719
I have taken it as soon as a science

1233
00:51:54,519 --> 00:51:59,039
teacher say gives procedures for an

1234
00:51:56,719 --> 00:52:00,919
experiment to their class they're

1235
00:51:59,039 --> 00:52:03,639
ensuring that no science is going to be

1236
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:06,680
done that day

1237
00:52:03,639 --> 00:52:10,078
why because who owns the

1238
00:52:06,679 --> 00:52:12,039
procedures the teacher you've taken all

1239
00:52:10,079 --> 00:52:13,720
of the ownership away from the students

1240
00:52:12,039 --> 00:52:15,480
you're asking them to be technicians

1241
00:52:13,719 --> 00:52:19,000
follow these

1242
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:22,838
procedures but a creative compromise is

1243
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:25,760
for you to with the class explore the

1244
00:52:22,838 --> 00:52:27,318
problem at hand so your class comes up

1245
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:28,280
with the experiment you happen to have

1246
00:52:27,318 --> 00:52:31,440
written

1247
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:33,359
up did you hear what I just said okay a

1248
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:36,280
good teacher an Artful teacher will be

1249
00:52:33,358 --> 00:52:38,598
able to to facilitate conversation in

1250
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:40,839
the class so that the class moves in

1251
00:52:38,599 --> 00:52:42,400
some direction and if you can get your

1252
00:52:40,838 --> 00:52:44,239
students to come up with the experiment

1253
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:47,798
you happen to have written up why is

1254
00:52:44,239 --> 00:52:49,679
that a difference between night and day

1255
00:52:47,798 --> 00:52:52,838
who owns it

1256
00:52:49,679 --> 00:52:55,279
then they do and that's really really

1257
00:52:52,838 --> 00:52:57,000
important so ownership and learning is

1258
00:52:55,280 --> 00:53:00,079
important critical thinking

1259
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:02,199
understanding logic you know I think

1260
00:53:00,079 --> 00:53:04,000
that there should be a bar that has to

1261
00:53:02,199 --> 00:53:05,318
be passed for people who want to go into

1262
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:08,440
public office they have to pass a

1263
00:53:05,318 --> 00:53:09,960
critical thinking test you know I I I

1264
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:12,559
just I don't understand I was saying

1265
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:15,440
this to a couple of people um Akin you

1266
00:53:12,559 --> 00:53:18,760
know the the famous uh the the famous

1267
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:20,920
congressman who said that uh in case of

1268
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:23,760
um in case of legitimate rape a woman

1269
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:27,400
has the ability to shut down a pregnancy

1270
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:29,240
and Brawn from Georgia who said that um

1271
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:32,200
uh Evolution and the Big Bang are the

1272
00:53:29,239 --> 00:53:34,399
biggest lies of the devil and and and

1273
00:53:32,199 --> 00:53:37,279
here's the insanity both of these

1274
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:40,519
gentlemen sit on the US House science

1275
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:44,200
space and Technology

1276
00:53:40,519 --> 00:53:46,440
committee okay so you know we have a

1277
00:53:44,199 --> 00:53:49,239
problem ladies and gentlemen okay

1278
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:51,200
problem solving that art form by which

1279
00:53:49,239 --> 00:53:53,199
you take a question and find a pathway

1280
00:53:51,199 --> 00:53:56,159
to An Answer navigation of an

1281
00:53:53,199 --> 00:53:58,639
interdisciplinary landscape you know how

1282
00:53:56,159 --> 00:54:01,440
many of you took you know trigonometry

1283
00:53:58,639 --> 00:54:02,639
and calculus remember that okay do you

1284
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:04,440
know how many students that take

1285
00:54:02,639 --> 00:54:06,199
trigonometry and calculus ask this

1286
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:09,440
question why do I need to know this

1287
00:54:06,199 --> 00:54:12,558
stuff because because the math is taught

1288
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:15,960
in full isolation from actual

1289
00:54:12,559 --> 00:54:17,798
use math is the language of nature if

1290
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:19,159
you want to understand her and

1291
00:54:17,798 --> 00:54:22,199
understand how she operates you have to

1292
00:54:19,159 --> 00:54:25,199
speak her language it's a language and

1293
00:54:22,199 --> 00:54:26,759
if I were to teach French and and you

1294
00:54:25,199 --> 00:54:29,159
were never going to use that French to

1295
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:31,960
talk to other people who speak French or

1296
00:54:29,159 --> 00:54:34,798
go and read the the the the literature

1297
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:36,838
the um and newspapers in French and

1298
00:54:34,798 --> 00:54:38,880
understand the French culture if you

1299
00:54:36,838 --> 00:54:41,358
were never to do that why would you want

1300
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:44,240
to take French just to memorize

1301
00:54:41,358 --> 00:54:47,519
vocabulary why would we subject our

1302
00:54:44,239 --> 00:54:50,719
students to these stove pipe math

1303
00:54:47,519 --> 00:54:53,599
courses with no connection to why math

1304
00:54:50,719 --> 00:54:57,558
provides the ability for the human race

1305
00:54:53,599 --> 00:54:59,400
to see so interdisciplinary Landscapes

1306
00:54:57,559 --> 00:55:01,000
you got to navigate it's not like

1307
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:02,599
opening a physics book and closing it

1308
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:05,239
and opening a chemistry book and closing

1309
00:55:02,599 --> 00:55:07,599
it and opening an art book book life is

1310
00:55:05,239 --> 00:55:09,679
an interdisciplinary tapestry and

1311
00:55:07,599 --> 00:55:12,119
education ought to mirror that maybe I'm

1312
00:55:09,679 --> 00:55:14,039
asking too much for the education system

1313
00:55:12,119 --> 00:55:16,880
but what I'm simply saying is that

1314
00:55:14,039 --> 00:55:19,119
education ought to be nurturing what is

1315
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:22,119
natural to human

1316
00:55:19,119 --> 00:55:22,119
learning

1317
00:55:22,599 --> 00:55:27,599
so and as an example as a working

1318
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:31,079
example that I'm familiar with in terms

1319
00:55:27,599 --> 00:55:33,359
of Science Education which is now called

1320
00:55:31,079 --> 00:55:35,798
stem okay if you if you've been doing

1321
00:55:33,358 --> 00:55:37,318
good Science Education it had to be stem

1322
00:55:35,798 --> 00:55:39,440
because science technology engineering

1323
00:55:37,318 --> 00:55:44,038
and math cannot be done in isolation

1324
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:47,599
from from each other but my view is if

1325
00:55:44,039 --> 00:55:50,720
if exploration is something that our CH

1326
00:55:47,599 --> 00:55:52,798
our children are born to be able to do

1327
00:55:50,719 --> 00:55:54,519
and science is nothing but organized

1328
00:55:52,798 --> 00:55:56,798
curiosity and evidence-based learning

1329
00:55:54,519 --> 00:55:59,358
for the human human race our children

1330
00:55:56,798 --> 00:56:02,358
are capable right now of being immersed

1331
00:55:59,358 --> 00:56:04,639
in real science and doing science which

1332
00:56:02,358 --> 00:56:08,480
means that Science Education could be

1333
00:56:04,639 --> 00:56:11,558
about modeling real science immersing

1334
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:15,039
kids in science letting them be

1335
00:56:11,559 --> 00:56:18,079
scientists and Engineers right now not

1336
00:56:15,039 --> 00:56:19,880
talking about the science knowledge base

1337
00:56:18,079 --> 00:56:22,559
The Book of Knowledge is not science

1338
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:25,880
that's what you get from science or

1339
00:56:22,559 --> 00:56:28,760
talking at science let them do science

1340
00:56:25,880 --> 00:56:30,519
and the program that we did to really

1341
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:32,280
put that to the test which has been very

1342
00:56:30,519 --> 00:56:34,798
successful is the student space flight

1343
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:36,559
experiments program where we can say to

1344
00:56:34,798 --> 00:56:38,400
a school district we're going to give

1345
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:40,760
you your own space program we're going

1346
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:42,559
to give you a real microgravity mini

1347
00:56:40,760 --> 00:56:44,000
laboratory and all launch services to

1348
00:56:42,559 --> 00:56:46,160
get it to the International Space

1349
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:47,760
Station have an astronaut assigned as a

1350
00:56:46,159 --> 00:56:49,798
technician to operate the single

1351
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:53,000
experiment it contains return it safely

1352
00:56:49,798 --> 00:56:55,199
to Earth and just like NASA that school

1353
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:58,440
district at the local level says to at

1354
00:56:55,199 --> 00:57:00,399
least 300 students you're all scientists

1355
00:56:58,440 --> 00:57:02,119
and break into research teams and each

1356
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:05,559
team design your own microgravity

1357
00:57:02,119 --> 00:57:07,519
research program and each team Des write

1358
00:57:05,559 --> 00:57:09,079
your own research proposal which will go

1359
00:57:07,519 --> 00:57:10,759
through a formal two-step Proposal

1360
00:57:09,079 --> 00:57:13,640
review process just like professional

1361
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:15,240
researchers and one of those teams will

1362
00:57:13,639 --> 00:57:17,920
have their experiments selected for

1363
00:57:15,239 --> 00:57:20,879
flight and we're doing this with fifth

1364
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:23,798
graders grades 5 through 12 and it is

1365
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:27,119
stunning what we're seeing we we've had

1366
00:57:23,798 --> 00:57:28,920
21,7 00 students fully immersed in

1367
00:57:27,119 --> 00:57:32,000
experiment design and proposal writing

1368
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:34,358
over 4,000 proposals all this since

1369
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:36,480
2010 students are saying I never knew

1370
00:57:34,358 --> 00:57:37,759
this was science teachers are saying wow

1371
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:40,159
this is a completely different way to

1372
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:42,559
teach science a project-based approach

1373
00:57:40,159 --> 00:57:44,078
immersing students in every facet of

1374
00:57:42,559 --> 00:57:45,680
real research and they even get their

1375
00:57:44,079 --> 00:57:47,359
own research conference at the

1376
00:57:45,679 --> 00:57:50,679
Smithsonian National Air and Space

1377
00:57:47,358 --> 00:57:52,960
Museum so I I have obviously oh we're

1378
00:57:50,679 --> 00:57:55,358
out of time I got to stop we I obviously

1379
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:57,280
have some very strong opinions about

1380
00:57:55,358 --> 00:57:59,078
human exploration science and Science

1381
00:57:57,280 --> 00:58:02,280
Education and more generally human

1382
00:57:59,079 --> 00:58:06,000
exploration and um you know professional

1383
00:58:02,280 --> 00:58:07,720
exploration and how we teach uh in an

1384
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:11,318
interdisciplinary way subjects in the

1385
00:58:07,719 --> 00:58:14,318
classroom but I also have a track record

1386
00:58:11,318 --> 00:58:18,239
for putting that into

1387
00:58:14,318 --> 00:58:23,639
practice and I think that what we are in

1388
00:58:18,239 --> 00:58:26,439
right now as a um as a test based

1389
00:58:23,639 --> 00:58:30,279
educational system that stifles

1390
00:58:26,440 --> 00:58:34,119
creativity that denies many Learners the

1391
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:37,280
ability to be curious that forces

1392
00:58:34,119 --> 00:58:39,760
testing um uh education to serve testing

1393
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:43,559
and not testing serve education is a

1394
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:45,839
recipe for success is not a is a re it's

1395
00:58:43,559 --> 00:58:48,119
a recipe for success for

1396
00:58:45,838 --> 00:58:51,199
China oh I pulled that out at the last

1397
00:58:48,119 --> 00:58:53,280
minute okay so um I think I'll stop here

1398
00:58:51,199 --> 00:58:56,719
um I'm certainly able to answer any

1399
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:56,720
questions if people want to m

1400
00:59:05,599 --> 00:59:11,318
rounder this has been a production of

1401
