1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:06,879
acer saccharinum or silver maple

2
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:07,839
has distinctively lobed leaves five

3
00:00:06,878 --> 00:00:10,480
lobes with a

4
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:11,120
terminal lobe being longer than the

5
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:13,839
others

6
00:00:11,119 --> 00:00:15,199
and each lobe has teeth on it so it

7
00:00:13,839 --> 00:00:18,559
looks very very

8
00:00:15,199 --> 00:00:20,719
highly textured this is a large tree

9
00:00:18,559 --> 00:00:21,679
that has clusters of buds that are more

10
00:00:20,719 --> 00:00:23,919
yellow

11
00:00:21,679 --> 00:00:26,079
than red than the so than the red maple

12
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:29,199
so clusters of yellow buds

13
00:00:26,079 --> 00:00:34,879
and highly toothed lobed leaves

14
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:34,880
for acer saccharinum or silver maple
