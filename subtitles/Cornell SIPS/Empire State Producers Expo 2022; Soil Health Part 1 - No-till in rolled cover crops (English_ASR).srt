00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:05,839
this is a production of cornell

00:00:03,198 --> 00:00:05,839
university

3
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:11,280
thanks ryan

4
00:00:09,279 --> 00:00:13,839
yeah crystal and i have a

5
00:00:11,279 --> 00:00:15,439
a small vegetable and seed farm here in

6
00:00:13,839 --> 00:00:17,839
johnstown new york

7
00:00:15,439 --> 00:00:20,239
and where we focus

8
00:00:17,839 --> 00:00:22,559
primarily on seed garlic

9
00:00:20,239 --> 00:00:24,000
and some small vegetables and we also

10
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:26,719
have incorporated

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,518
some ongoing research

12
00:00:26,719 --> 00:00:30,799
of our favorite topic is to improve soil

13
00:00:29,518 --> 00:00:32,479
health so

14
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,558
um

15
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:37,119
we were able to get a grant from north

16
00:00:34,558 --> 00:00:38,959
east sarah to continue some of the work

17
00:00:37,119 --> 00:00:41,199
that i was doing at the hudson valley

18
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,640
farm hub

19
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,879
too and

20
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:48,079
to plant vegetables

21
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:49,920
um in a vegetarian cover crop

22
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:52,079
and i thought it would be good to tell

23
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:55,439
the story a little bit how we got there

24
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:57,600
um to begin with and how we ended up you

25
00:00:55,439 --> 00:00:59,280
know what our conclusions were from this

26
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,800
basically five-year

27
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,120
journey of

28
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:06,079
trying to work with planting vegetables

29
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:06,079
to a cover crop

30
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:09,920
all right if i can just

31
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:14,559
find a way to here we go

32
00:01:13,519 --> 00:01:16,959
all right

33
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,560
um first uh ryan asked me to

34
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:21,039
briefly introduce for some of the folks

35
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,478
that are not as familiar

36
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,240
with this system

37
00:01:22,478 --> 00:01:26,159
is to talk about the fact that we're

38
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:27,519
rolling and crimping a cover crop and

39
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:28,400
trying to plant the vegetables through

40
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:30,239
this

41
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,920
well some of the principles that we've

42
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:33,679
all learned from some of the work that

43
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,040
have been done extensively with field

44
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,640
crops is that

45
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,400
we know that if you want to be

46
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,560
successful with this you want to plant

47
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:44,799
your fall cover crops early

48
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:46,320
means like september 1st is a good date

49
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:48,640
we also want to make sure that we are

50
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:51,118
rolling and crimping which is this tool

51
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:53,118
that is either mounted before or behind

52
00:01:51,118 --> 00:01:54,719
the tractor we'll see some more pictures

53
00:01:53,118 --> 00:01:57,438
of that later on

54
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:59,840
um when plants are in it anthesis that

55
00:01:57,438 --> 00:02:01,599
means then they are in full flower

56
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:04,320
not when they have pollinated because

57
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:05,438
that's when they actually can set seeds

58
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:06,319
um

59
00:02:05,438 --> 00:02:09,519
now

60
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:11,680
cereals um have an anticipate usually of

61
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:14,159
about that last about a week

62
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,439
the legumes are we consider to be

63
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:17,598
indeterminate

64
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:19,199
and there is no real antejesus point

65
00:02:17,598 --> 00:02:20,639
it's more like there is constant

66
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:23,280
flowering happening

67
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:26,079
makes it much more difficult

68
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,280
to kill that cover crop

69
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,760
and

70
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,680
especially under the organic conditions

71
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:35,598
that we're working with

72
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:37,360
so about five years ago um we

73
00:02:35,598 --> 00:02:39,119
with the pro farmer program at the

74
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,959
hudson valley farmhub

75
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,360
we had a

76
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:45,840
deep interest in seeing how we could

77
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:47,920
stop tilling and plant a vegetable

78
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,680
directly to a cover crop

79
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:50,878
and we did a number of different cover

80
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,120
crops

81
00:02:50,878 --> 00:02:54,878
of which i will just focus right now on

82
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:57,039
the arson winter piece and some of the

83
00:02:54,878 --> 00:03:01,598
hairy vets that we did

84
00:02:57,039 --> 00:03:04,079
and um by pure coincidence um as we had

85
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:05,919
so much land in cover crops and we

86
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,800
didn't really plan want to find all that

87
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:10,000
egg grits into vegetables uh we planted

88
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,400
some buckwheat

89
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,080
with the no-till drill uh true austrian

90
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,319
winter piece

91
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,879
and what we were finding is that that

92
00:03:16,318 --> 00:03:22,158
cover crop was killed while the one that

93
00:03:18,878 --> 00:03:23,679
we just rolled and crimped was not

94
00:03:22,158 --> 00:03:26,239
you can see here what happens with the

95
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:28,560
no-till drill is that when you slice it

96
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:30,560
every seven inches it actually provides

97
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,640
a very effective kill

98
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:35,360
to arsenal winter piece and what we also

99
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:38,079
found uh with hairy vetch as well

100
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:40,239
so in order to accomplish uh the killing

101
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:42,879
of a cover crop

102
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:44,319
um that is an indeterminate plant you

103
00:03:42,878 --> 00:03:46,000
have to do something more than just

104
00:03:44,318 --> 00:03:48,399
rolling it and crimping it you actually

105
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,639
have to slice it without bringing up

106
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:54,000
soil of course

107
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:55,119
here you can see where's the

108
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,199
airy vetch

109
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:59,599
and again you can see

110
00:03:57,199 --> 00:04:01,518
this no-till drill

111
00:03:59,598 --> 00:04:03,598
has cultures

112
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:06,239
to allow the seeds to

113
00:04:03,598 --> 00:04:08,878
actually go into the ground and of

114
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:10,640
course the seed box is empty for this

115
00:04:08,878 --> 00:04:12,000
particular situation

116
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:15,839
and then

117
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,840
it's a better slide right here

118
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:21,358
and then we plant it with a

119
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:24,079
very specific no-till planter very

120
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:27,279
expensive piece of equipment

121
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:29,918
uh we planted directly into uh the hair

122
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:32,719
effect we planted sweet corn

123
00:04:29,918 --> 00:04:35,599
and then in the arson winter piece we

124
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:37,040
planted some broccoli and cauliflower

125
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,600
you can see there's a lot of open ground

126
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,720
there when you're using 100 legume mix

127
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,320
there is

128
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,240
an awful lot of ground that is still

129
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:45,599
exposed

130
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,759
and this is what it looked like right

131
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:51,040
after planting

132
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:53,439
so it's still pretty pretty clean

133
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:55,360
a little bit later

134
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:58,079
but if you take a closer look you can

135
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:59,040
see that a lot of weeds are going to be

136
00:04:58,079 --> 00:05:00,478
um

137
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,479
establishing

138
00:05:00,478 --> 00:05:04,399
to the extent where like

139
00:05:02,478 --> 00:05:08,000
you're gonna lose your crop if you don't

140
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:09,679
address the wheat issues there

141
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,478
so there wasn't a high residue

142
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:14,959
cultivator um but a lilliston rolling

143
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:16,560
cultivator was used that was a thing in

144
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:18,239
the barn and one of our pro farmers

145
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,120
painted it up nicely

146
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,759
and

147
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:23,680
we used that actually quite successfully

148
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:25,360
um to go through the ashley winter piece

149
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,639
so the osha winter piece was not

150
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,560
something that

151
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:30,079
needed a very specific piece of

152
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,839
equipment

153
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:35,359
but because it's pretty rough and the

154
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:38,000
distance between the um

155
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:40,319
lilistans is quite wide and it didn't do

156
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,399
a phenomenal job

157
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:43,918
a lot of hoeing was required and even

158
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:45,758
despite the hauling

159
00:05:43,918 --> 00:05:47,839
the weeds were getting in

160
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:49,520
but what's interesting to see here when

161
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:51,679
you look at the slide

162
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:53,519
it's taken on august

163
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,519
and then we did a side-by-side

164
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:58,000
comparison between where we did

165
00:05:55,519 --> 00:06:00,399
conventional till

166
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,319
you can see that this crop is wilting

167
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:04,239
so the

168
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:05,759
water holding capacity of the soil is so

169
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,120
much greater

170
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:10,240
in the

171
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:13,038
plots where we didn't till

172
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:14,960
the potential till before planting so we

173
00:06:13,038 --> 00:06:16,959
were really fascinated the structure was

174
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:18,959
much better

175
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:21,519
in that plot so we were encouraged to

176
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:22,239
continue that work

177
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:24,560
but

178
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:27,519
um here is the kicker is that

179
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:30,079
in order to be successful there um we

180
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:32,240
had an army of people hand holding it

181
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:35,038
and keep the weeds down

182
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:37,600
so conclusions really of um

183
00:06:35,038 --> 00:06:40,478
this uh whole trial

184
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,479
is that um

185
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,918
um

186
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:46,000
first of all

187
00:06:43,918 --> 00:06:47,680
that legumes are difficult to roll in

188
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,918
crimp and you're going to have to have

189
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,959
access to a kind of expensive piece of

190
00:06:49,918 --> 00:06:53,519
equipment

191
00:06:50,959 --> 00:06:56,638
which right now is more possible with

192
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:57,758
usda grants that have been made

193
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:59,918
to make

194
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:03,439
no-till drills available to your usda

195
00:06:59,918 --> 00:07:05,439
office and i encourage everybody to

196
00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:07,680
talk to their local uca asian it is

197
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:10,639
possible to apply for our grants to get

198
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:12,400
a machine like that in your county

199
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:13,759
um it's difficult to control weeds

200
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:15,279
unless you have access to the equipment

201
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:17,439
that can deal with high residue so there

202
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:19,839
are high residue cultivators

203
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:21,598
and a little sun rolling cultivator is

204
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:23,839
not the ideal piece of equipment high

205
00:07:21,598 --> 00:07:26,719
residue cultivators are very specific

206
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:30,000
and get a lot closer to the crop and

207
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:32,160
allow you to do much better weed control

208
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,560
the other thing we found is that similar

209
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:36,240
or even better yields were in the

210
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:38,639
no-till plots

211
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,160
unless you know under the

212
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:41,519
condition that you keep your weeds under

213
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:43,120
control

214
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:45,120
and of course the positive results that

215
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:47,598
we had which only accomplished because

216
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:49,918
of very high labor input which we didn't

217
00:07:47,598 --> 00:07:51,918
feel that um

218
00:07:49,918 --> 00:07:53,680
did had a commercial application yet for

219
00:07:51,918 --> 00:07:55,439
organic farmers

220
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:58,120
but we were intrigued

221
00:07:55,439 --> 00:08:01,839
and i wanted to continue and then for

222
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:04,478
2018 we tried to continue this trial at

223
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:06,478
roxbury farm but as soon after rolling

224
00:08:04,478 --> 00:08:08,240
we actually discovered that

225
00:08:06,478 --> 00:08:11,038
the local

226
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:13,038
rye and harry vets was purchased

227
00:08:11,038 --> 00:08:15,199
was full of wheat seeds

228
00:08:13,038 --> 00:08:16,639
and we had to abandon it so here again

229
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:19,038
it's one of these things where you learn

230
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:21,360
along the way if you are doing something

231
00:08:19,038 --> 00:08:24,240
like this you you cannot

232
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:26,400
uh afford uh to get sea that is not

233
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:29,038
completely clean

234
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:30,959
and and do you have to be more careful

235
00:08:29,038 --> 00:08:32,639
in preparing your seed bed so you have a

236
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:36,240
very clean sea but so you also don't

237
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:36,240
have overwintering weeds as well

238
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:40,958
then in 2019 when we moved to philia

239
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:43,518
farm in johnstown we were able to obtain

240
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:46,479
a grant through north east here

241
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:49,120
and we set up an experimental trial

242
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:50,800
with 27 plots whereby the premise was

243
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,959
like

244
00:08:50,799 --> 00:08:54,958
we know we don't have good wheat control

245
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:57,119
with just hairy vetch

246
00:08:54,958 --> 00:08:59,039
what about if we mix in a small amount

247
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:01,120
of twitter kale and see

248
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:03,679
um if that will provide it with the

249
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:05,839
optimum amount of weed control

250
00:09:03,679 --> 00:09:08,479
let's do 20 pounds of 3d kale all the

251
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:10,800
way up to 80 pounds of twitter kale

252
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,720
and see what difference we will make

253
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:15,359
what we had learned from our colleagues

254
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:18,160
that doing field crops is that

255
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:19,839
biomass really matters in order to have

256
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:21,600
optimum weed control

257
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:23,760
and we know that the biomass of just

258
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:25,680
hairy vets especially in the northern

259
00:09:23,759 --> 00:09:26,879
regions is about two and a half thousand

260
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:29,278
pounds

261
00:09:26,879 --> 00:09:31,200
and what we learned from our colleagues

262
00:09:29,278 --> 00:09:33,600
that they said well you wanna wanna have

263
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:35,440
about between five and seven thousand

264
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:37,839
pounds of biomass in order to really

265
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:40,320
suppress these weeds

266
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:42,880
so this is what we did and this is what

267
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:44,640
the um

268
00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:47,200
what it looked like

269
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:49,199
we had a randomized

270
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,480
way of looking at all these different

271
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:53,759
seedings

272
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:56,080
replicated three times each particular

273
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:58,480
seeding rate

274
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:00,399
and this is what the hair the triticale

275
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:02,399
and the hairy effects look like the

276
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:04,639
following year

277
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:07,440
in 2020

278
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:09,679
and then we wrote and crimped it um

279
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:12,480
sometime

280
00:10:09,679 --> 00:10:16,078
around the beginning of june

281
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:16,079
when the triticale was anticipated

282
00:10:17,039 --> 00:10:23,919
and um what we already right away

283
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:25,919
learned is that at the very lower um

284
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:27,278
rates of critical

285
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:31,599
uh the hairy

286
00:10:27,278 --> 00:10:33,278
batch is very very well

287
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,320
a

288
00:10:33,278 --> 00:10:36,879
lot

289
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:39,200
which then gave a problem for us

290
00:10:36,879 --> 00:10:40,799
um to be able to plant in it afterwards

291
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:43,200
you can see here where the brown spot is

292
00:10:40,799 --> 00:10:46,000
that is the control plot

293
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:48,160
so we could make a comparison between

294
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,759
conventional till and the different

295
00:10:48,159 --> 00:10:51,360
seeding rates

296
00:10:49,759 --> 00:10:54,399
another aspect of the grant was to be

297
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:55,680
able to see like if we take a regular

298
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:57,600
planter

299
00:10:55,679 --> 00:11:00,239
how do we have to modify it

300
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:02,399
in order to plant undernotal conditions

301
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:04,639
and one of the things is that

302
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:06,320
you can take a regular transplanter and

303
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:08,078
plan with no-till

304
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:10,560
given that you do have a double disc

305
00:11:08,078 --> 00:11:13,039
opener in front of the transplanter

306
00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:15,278
and that you modify

307
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:17,278
the uh closing wheels

308
00:11:15,278 --> 00:11:19,600
uh closing is more of an issue actually

309
00:11:17,278 --> 00:11:21,919
under no till conditions than opening uh

310
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:24,399
is what we found is that these regular

311
00:11:21,919 --> 00:11:26,159
and i'm gonna put my mouse right on here

312
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:27,839
those are the regular closing wheels

313
00:11:26,159 --> 00:11:30,159
they have a little bit of a bevel there

314
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:31,519
a little a little bit of an edge

315
00:11:30,159 --> 00:11:34,000
we had to replace them with the

316
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:35,120
old-fashioned closing wheels

317
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,679
um

318
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:39,759
and you see there is no bevel there so

319
00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:41,278
they wouldn't start riding on the hard

320
00:11:39,759 --> 00:11:42,639
grounds

321
00:11:41,278 --> 00:11:44,559
the other thing is we had to mount

322
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:46,480
coulters in front

323
00:11:44,559 --> 00:11:49,039
of the transplanter and here we used

324
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:50,560
wavy holders that later on were replaced

325
00:11:49,039 --> 00:11:54,000
with straight holders we found that the

326
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:54,000
straight cultures work really well

327
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:58,480
you see those cinder blocks sitting on

328
00:11:56,078 --> 00:12:00,078
here to provide some extra weight

329
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:03,278
that is actually

330
00:12:00,078 --> 00:12:06,559
more of an issue about the fact that we

331
00:12:03,278 --> 00:12:08,000
drove so much on the trial plots in

332
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:09,599
order to get all these different

333
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,399
seedings done

334
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:14,959
and we rolled and crimped twice

335
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:16,399
which caused so much compaction

336
00:12:14,958 --> 00:12:17,759
that we

337
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:19,759
had to

338
00:12:17,759 --> 00:12:22,240
put weight on the coil to wheels but i

339
00:12:19,759 --> 00:12:24,319
think that under normal conditions

340
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:26,879
that should not be as much of an issue

341
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:29,120
that was really something that we we

342
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:33,120
were self-inflicted um

343
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:36,320
in a way due to the setup of the trial

344
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:38,879
and here we are uh planting uh cabbage

345
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:40,639
uh we chose for passat

346
00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:42,639
young from the height of bay or seat we

347
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:45,360
had a conversation with him

348
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:48,000
and we wanted a quick closing cap as we

349
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:50,000
knew that sweet corn is a crop that can

350
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,000
be done relatively

351
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:55,919
successful under those conditions to

352
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:57,759
provide weed control through shading

353
00:12:55,919 --> 00:13:00,000
and we hope that facade will be one of

354
00:12:57,759 --> 00:13:02,559
those cabbages that would also

355
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,720
establish relatively quickly

356
00:13:02,559 --> 00:13:06,399
to provide the shade that was needed

357
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:08,560
you can see the hairy vetch is not fully

358
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:10,078
killed we did not have access to a

359
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:12,479
no-till drill

360
00:13:10,078 --> 00:13:14,638
the only thing that we used here is a

361
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:16,399
roller and crimper

362
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:17,680
so not ideal

363
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:19,600
and you can see that the hairy vet

364
00:13:17,679 --> 00:13:20,559
started coming back the cabbage started

365
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,720
growing

366
00:13:20,559 --> 00:13:24,399
and we started monitoring the progress

367
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:26,959
of different

368
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:26,958
cabbages

369
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:30,799
now

370
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:33,360
what really came out of this trial is

371
00:13:30,799 --> 00:13:35,599
inconclusive really that there's any

372
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:37,200
difference between

373
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:40,560
the seeding rates

374
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:42,959
and eventual yield

375
00:13:40,559 --> 00:13:45,838
we also found that the compaction was a

376
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:48,319
great limiting factor

377
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:50,160
in order to allow the cabbage to thrive

378
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:52,079
the way that they should be so there's

379
00:13:50,159 --> 00:13:53,838
definitely something inherent in the

380
00:13:52,078 --> 00:13:55,838
fact that we did this trial the way we

381
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:58,560
did that we didn't see the results that

382
00:13:55,839 --> 00:14:01,279
we would like to see

383
00:13:58,559 --> 00:14:03,119
but then so we counted

384
00:14:01,278 --> 00:14:05,439
how many heads we had

385
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:07,759
and how much they weighed and translated

386
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:10,320
that to yield per acre and as you can

387
00:14:07,759 --> 00:14:12,958
see here the yields varied anywhere

388
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:14,879
between 20 to 30 000 pounds

389
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:16,638
to the acre

390
00:14:14,879 --> 00:14:18,879
and um

391
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:20,320
um

392
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:21,919
yeah

393
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:24,480
there was nothing that really came

394
00:14:21,919 --> 00:14:26,879
forward that we said like well um we we

395
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:29,120
do need a higher rate or a lower rate of

396
00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:31,519
critical

397
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:33,440
so what we did we said like let's do an

398
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:35,839
extension of the trial because this is

399
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:39,519
inconclusive data let's do this one more

400
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:40,639
time and just do the higher um seating

401
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:43,039
rates

402
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:45,680
with 3d kill

403
00:14:43,039 --> 00:14:48,078
so one more time the conclusions of that

404
00:14:45,679 --> 00:14:51,039
first year of trial with no obvious

405
00:14:48,078 --> 00:14:52,078
correlate between the seed mixes

406
00:14:51,039 --> 00:14:53,679
um

407
00:14:52,078 --> 00:14:55,278
no obvious difference in population

408
00:14:53,679 --> 00:14:58,479
that's between 20 and 40 pounds so

409
00:14:55,278 --> 00:15:01,519
there's another interesting thing

410
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:04,879
veg seed especially oregano is expensive

411
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:07,440
so we really don't have to up our

412
00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:09,838
population of veg to get a good

413
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:11,279
establishment

414
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:12,880
and then what i already said that the

415
00:15:11,278 --> 00:15:14,639
seed mixed with the low triticale were

416
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:16,078
lodged

417
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:18,240
and that the yield is negatively

418
00:15:16,078 --> 00:15:20,638
impacted

419
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:22,959
and that conventional planting equipment

420
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:26,000
can successfully be adapted for planting

421
00:15:22,958 --> 00:15:28,319
to a cover crop

422
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,679
one other fun thing we did

423
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:32,399
actually was not

424
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:34,319
um by design completely

425
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:35,839
because we grew some shallots next to

426
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:37,920
the garlic

427
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:39,279
and this field was in garlic the

428
00:15:37,919 --> 00:15:40,719
previous year

429
00:15:39,278 --> 00:15:43,919
and the shelves were harvested later

430
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:47,040
than the garlic and we ended up planting

431
00:15:43,919 --> 00:15:48,879
one bed of treaty kale and veg

432
00:15:47,039 --> 00:15:49,679
about a month later

433
00:15:48,879 --> 00:15:51,838
than

434
00:15:49,679 --> 00:15:54,000
the vet then the twitty kale and vets on

435
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:55,759
the right and you can see in the spring

436
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,759
a phenomenal difference in development

437
00:15:55,759 --> 00:16:00,320
so just to illustrate how important it

438
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:05,278
is to get your cover crop

439
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:05,278
established in time uh in the fall

440
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:10,480
and then we wrote in crimp this time

441
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,320
with the high with the 80 to 100 pounds

442
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:15,120
of triticale

443
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:16,000
we had phenomenal coverage uh in the

444
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:18,560
field

445
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,839
we ended up hand planting winter squash

446
00:16:18,559 --> 00:16:21,599
in there

447
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:24,079
we chose winter squash we knew that

448
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,120
nitrogen might become an issue

449
00:16:24,078 --> 00:16:27,439
and

450
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:29,440
since winter squash has a lower need for

451
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:31,759
nitrogen and cabbage we hope to have

452
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:33,360
more success with that

453
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:35,759
and maybe the rates

454
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:39,120
were even higher than 80 to 100 pounds

455
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:42,399
we actually didn't exactly know

456
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:43,679
what the rates were

457
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:45,440
um

458
00:16:43,679 --> 00:16:47,039
as you can see here we covered them in

459
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:51,079
order to protect them against cucumber

460
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:51,078
beetles with floating row covers

461
00:16:51,278 --> 00:16:56,320
but the plans soon petered out

462
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:58,720
and weeds actually took over even with

463
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:02,639
the heavy cover so

464
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:02,639
again this was not a great success

465
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:08,000
so the conclusions is that cereal cover

466
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:09,919
crops to be used for boiling crimping

467
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,640
under the organic growing conditions is

468
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:15,038
really not advisable

469
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:16,959
but unless you and sarah will be talking

470
00:17:15,038 --> 00:17:18,959
about this after this presentation

471
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:21,199
unless you're playing a legume also at

472
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:23,279
the hudson valley farm up we had very

473
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:25,679
good luck with growing edamame

474
00:17:23,279 --> 00:17:27,519
and green beans after growing a straight

475
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:31,038
crop of rye and rolling and crimping

476
00:17:27,519 --> 00:17:34,079
dots so that worked well

477
00:17:31,038 --> 00:17:36,960
but when you try to plant um

478
00:17:34,079 --> 00:17:40,000
cabbage or cauliflower broccoli sweet

479
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:42,000
corn and even winter squash um you

480
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,839
really need to find a way

481
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:47,200
to plant that directly to a

482
00:17:44,839 --> 00:17:50,159
legume but then the problem is when you

483
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:52,319
only use a legume

484
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:54,880
you really need to be able to kill

485
00:17:52,319 --> 00:17:57,439
that cover crop effectively so that's

486
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:59,120
where you need either to slice it

487
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:01,360
with a no-till drill

488
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:03,439
or other options would be to tarp it and

489
00:18:01,359 --> 00:18:05,119
i think later this afternoon we'll be

490
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:08,000
talking about tarping

491
00:18:05,119 --> 00:18:11,119
tarping will be an effective way to

492
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:13,200
kill your legume and would also kill any

493
00:18:11,119 --> 00:18:17,199
weeds that are still present

494
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:17,200
within your legume cover crop

495
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:22,798
and i think that ultimately

496
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:25,200
when you don't tarp and

497
00:18:22,798 --> 00:18:27,279
even when you can kill it with a no-till

498
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,880
drill

499
00:18:27,279 --> 00:18:30,000
i would say planting directed to a

500
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,480
legume

501
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,079
would be mostly feasible

502
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:36,079
if the weeds can be controlled with a

503
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:39,678
high residue cultivator

504
00:18:36,079 --> 00:18:41,038
that can go a bit closer

505
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:42,640
to the crops

506
00:18:41,038 --> 00:18:46,720
than

507
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:46,720
than say a littlest enrolling cultivator

508
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:54,400
i'm actually at the end i did it pretty

509
00:18:51,759 --> 00:18:57,519
rapidly i don't need my full time and i

510
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:58,798
actually um i'm very happy to open it up

511
00:18:57,519 --> 00:19:02,240
for

512
00:18:58,798 --> 00:19:03,440
questions that people have uh regarding

513
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,519
this so

514
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:07,360
um and i'm happy all to go back to

515
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:10,558
slides if people

516
00:19:07,359 --> 00:19:11,839
uh weren't completely clear about uh

517
00:19:10,558 --> 00:19:13,678
exactly

518
00:19:11,839 --> 00:19:16,319
what was being done

519
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:16,320
so thank you

520
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:20,720
thank you john paul yeah more time for

521
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:22,400
questions and discussion is good

522
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:25,360
you did well there

523
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:27,840
very succinct thank you for uh for

524
00:19:25,359 --> 00:19:29,678
sharing that those iterations over time

525
00:19:27,839 --> 00:19:32,240
it's pretty impressive

526
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:33,919
um how you stay persistent

527
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:35,120
to

528
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:37,120
continue

529
00:19:35,119 --> 00:19:39,119
does that mean that next year

530
00:19:37,119 --> 00:19:40,319
i'm waiting for folks to put stuff in

531
00:19:39,119 --> 00:19:43,519
the chat i have a question does that

532
00:19:40,319 --> 00:19:45,519
mean that um next year you you will not

533
00:19:43,519 --> 00:19:47,679
trial the system or you'll try to

534
00:19:45,519 --> 00:19:49,679
acquire high residue or what would be

535
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:51,360
the next step for you

536
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:53,200
um

537
00:19:51,359 --> 00:19:54,879
actually we're going to go one year back

538
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:58,160
to um

539
00:19:54,880 --> 00:20:00,799
introducing some more bare fallow uh

540
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:02,558
system because one of the weeds

541
00:20:00,798 --> 00:20:05,359
was not really very clear in the picture

542
00:20:02,558 --> 00:20:07,759
but one persistent wheat in our system

543
00:20:05,359 --> 00:20:08,879
about medium red clover

544
00:20:07,759 --> 00:20:11,200
and

545
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:12,880
so we want to flush that out flush it

546
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:16,400
out a little bit

547
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:19,200
is to reduce the enormous

548
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:20,798
seed bank we have of red clover

549
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,558
most people say like they scratched

550
00:20:20,798 --> 00:20:24,480
their head like wow we have a seed bank

551
00:20:22,558 --> 00:20:26,558
of gallon soga or

552
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:29,120
you know and we have a seed bank of red

553
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:32,000
clover so don't ask me how that happened

554
00:20:29,119 --> 00:20:35,519
it was it was in a hayfield for

555
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:37,200
about 20 25 years and we turned it over

556
00:20:35,519 --> 00:20:39,519
into crops

557
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:41,840
and what we're finding is that mostly

558
00:20:39,519 --> 00:20:43,599
what we're dealing with right now are

559
00:20:41,839 --> 00:20:44,639
either perennial weeds

560
00:20:43,599 --> 00:20:46,798
um

561
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,679
or we have rudbeckia for example as a

562
00:20:46,798 --> 00:20:51,279
wheat

563
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:53,600
and medium red clover so next year

564
00:20:51,279 --> 00:20:54,960
we are going to do some intensive cover

565
00:20:53,599 --> 00:20:57,519
cropping

566
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:59,919
and uh

567
00:20:57,519 --> 00:21:03,359
with some bear fellows in between to

568
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:05,360
clean these fields up a little bit more

569
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:07,678
i i did see that red clover in there i

570
00:21:05,359 --> 00:21:10,319
wanted to follow up on that too

571
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:12,798
much about that um we have quite a

572
00:21:10,319 --> 00:21:15,279
couple questions in here steve

573
00:21:12,798 --> 00:21:16,400
asks why triticale versus wheat or

574
00:21:15,279 --> 00:21:17,519
cereal rye

575
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,280
yeah and that was one of these other

576
00:21:17,519 --> 00:21:21,519
things um

577
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:23,440
the idea was

578
00:21:21,519 --> 00:21:26,798
that triticale might

579
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:28,159
flower a little bit later than rye

580
00:21:26,798 --> 00:21:31,519
and

581
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:32,880
again this was based on hearsay

582
00:21:31,519 --> 00:21:35,038
and i don't think that proved to be

583
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:36,880
correct we we wanted to do a little bit

584
00:21:35,038 --> 00:21:39,038
later rolling on crimping

585
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:40,480
hoping that the later you rolling

586
00:21:39,038 --> 00:21:42,640
crimped the vetch

587
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:44,880
maybe the more effective uh the killing

588
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:46,880
of the vetch would be that did not prove

589
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:49,919
to be true either so

590
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:51,919
um there is no reason to switch

591
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:54,240
rye for triticale

592
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:56,159
and uh robert asks

593
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:58,240
what is considered a high residue

594
00:21:56,159 --> 00:22:00,720
cultivator and i had a similar question

595
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:01,679
oh what's your experience with them and

596
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,679
and

597
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:05,200
you know you could talk more about high

598
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:08,000
residue cultivators

599
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:10,400
yeah there is a great picture i

600
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,798
think it's still in the field um the

601
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:14,400
book published by sarah

602
00:22:12,798 --> 00:22:16,240
if you would actually

603
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:19,120
uh google high res to do cultivator it

604
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:22,400
might come up uh it's a great picture

605
00:22:19,119 --> 00:22:25,279
that uh would show you there and

606
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:26,880
why it works the way it works is that

607
00:22:25,279 --> 00:22:28,798
um people who are familiar with the

608
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:31,200
no-till drill especially the the john

609
00:22:28,798 --> 00:22:33,440
deere type no-till drill

610
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:35,919
there are press wheels running in front

611
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:39,600
of the culture that actually holds

612
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:42,159
um the the crop residue down

613
00:22:39,599 --> 00:22:43,279
before the counter hits it well in this

614
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:44,880
case the

615
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:46,558
the colder wheels

616
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:49,039
and there will be two of them

617
00:22:46,558 --> 00:22:52,720
are holding the residue down

618
00:22:49,038 --> 00:22:57,200
and then the the knife slides underneath

619
00:22:52,720 --> 00:23:00,159
um the crop residue so holding that

620
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:02,080
cover crop in place is really important

621
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:03,360
that you don't start

622
00:23:02,079 --> 00:23:05,359
pushing

623
00:23:03,359 --> 00:23:08,000
the crop residue in front of your

624
00:23:05,359 --> 00:23:10,639
cultivators so by just holding this down

625
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:13,200
and slicing it and then go underneath

626
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:15,919
with a knife is what makes this thing

627
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:17,679
work really effectively

628
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:18,720
and it's an expensive piece of equipment

629
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:19,519
um

630
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:21,279
i

631
00:23:19,519 --> 00:23:24,480
priced one out and that's already back

632
00:23:21,279 --> 00:23:26,240
in 2017 and back then a two row

633
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:28,880
was already fourteen thousand dollars

634
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:29,919
and given where prices are right now

635
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,840
i don't know

636
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:34,159
a million

637
00:23:31,839 --> 00:23:35,839
so it's one of the things that um could

638
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:38,159
also be

639
00:23:35,839 --> 00:23:40,319
looked at to obtain

640
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:42,080
through usda if people are really

641
00:23:40,319 --> 00:23:43,278
interested if a number of growers come

642
00:23:42,079 --> 00:23:43,720
together

643
00:23:43,278 --> 00:23:44,798
and

644
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:47,038
[Music]

645
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:49,359
say like we would like to

646
00:23:47,038 --> 00:23:51,759
have usda purchase something like that

647
00:23:49,359 --> 00:23:53,038
with us along with the no-till drill

648
00:23:51,759 --> 00:23:55,440
this would be

649
00:23:53,038 --> 00:23:57,440
um a roller crimper

650
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:59,440
these are tools that really help with

651
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,960
soil health

652
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:03,038
one of the things i'm not discouraged

653
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:05,759
about is is that

654
00:24:03,038 --> 00:24:09,119
if you can work out the kings it does

655
00:24:05,759 --> 00:24:10,879
contribute tremendously to soil health

656
00:24:09,119 --> 00:24:13,599
soil aggregation

657
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:15,440
in a field that is not being tilled is

658
00:24:13,599 --> 00:24:19,678
so much greater

659
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:22,000
than under conventional till i wanted to

660
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:23,600
i wanted to ask you about flail mowing i

661
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,119
i know some people say that they're

662
00:24:23,599 --> 00:24:26,719
addicted to tillage i've heard you say

663
00:24:25,119 --> 00:24:29,199
that john paul

664
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:30,720
i'm addicted to flail mowing i like it

665
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:34,080
and i saw

666
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:36,480
it looks good afterwards and yeah um

667
00:24:34,079 --> 00:24:38,240
and uh we found that it kills things

668
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:41,839
like vetch and that seems to be like one

669
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:43,359
of your your primary issues

670
00:24:41,839 --> 00:24:44,480
you um

671
00:24:43,359 --> 00:24:46,079
you know there's trade-offs there

672
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:48,558
because things break down quicker but

673
00:24:46,079 --> 00:24:52,240
have you thought about that or um

674
00:24:48,558 --> 00:24:54,960
is there a role there for for mowing it

675
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:58,640
yeah i think it's an excellent situation

676
00:24:54,960 --> 00:25:02,400
ryan i think especially um it would make

677
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:03,520
the uh cultivation afterwards so much

678
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:05,120
easier

679
00:25:03,519 --> 00:25:08,079
because now you're breaking up the hairy

680
00:25:05,119 --> 00:25:08,959
vetch in smaller pieces and then

681
00:25:08,079 --> 00:25:10,639
i guess

682
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:12,720
what what it was is that we were

683
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:15,200
stubborn in the sense that we were

684
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:17,519
hoping that somehow miraculously

685
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:19,759
a cover crop would control the wheat we

686
00:25:17,519 --> 00:25:22,879
just plant and walk away from it that

687
00:25:19,759 --> 00:25:25,359
was kind of the attitude we have

688
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:27,039
not advisable so

689
00:25:25,359 --> 00:25:29,278
if you know that you're not going to

690
00:25:27,038 --> 00:25:31,038
control the weeds anyway and you're

691
00:25:29,278 --> 00:25:32,558
going to have

692
00:25:31,038 --> 00:25:35,919
and you don't have access to a high

693
00:25:32,558 --> 00:25:37,839
residue cultivator flail mowing is a

694
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:40,559
really great option

695
00:25:37,839 --> 00:25:43,119
because you can get in there

696
00:25:40,558 --> 00:25:45,038
with a little slim rolling cultivator

697
00:25:43,119 --> 00:25:46,639
and um actually

698
00:25:45,038 --> 00:25:49,278
there there is more

699
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:51,200
ability than to to

700
00:25:49,278 --> 00:25:52,240
allow it to work the way it's supposed

701
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:54,319
to work

702
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:58,079
uh by doing some healing

703
00:25:54,319 --> 00:25:59,519
under the the um when the stems are long

704
00:25:58,079 --> 00:26:01,199
it actually prevents the littlest

705
00:25:59,519 --> 00:26:02,000
enrolling cultivator

706
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:04,159
from

707
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,240
doing the the work it's supposed to do

708
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:08,400
with this the healing part it kind of

709
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:10,880
clogs up a little bit right i mean at

710
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:13,278
the end of the row you're out there with

711
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:15,039
a crowbar and removing quite a bit of

712
00:26:13,278 --> 00:26:16,240
the arsenal winter piece or the hairy

713
00:26:15,038 --> 00:26:19,200
vets

714
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:20,079
so it works but it doesn't really work

715
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,120
so

716
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:22,558
um

717
00:26:21,119 --> 00:26:26,479
really yes

718
00:26:22,558 --> 00:26:26,480
flail mowing excellent idea

719
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:31,840
and you've been doing it for um a long

720
00:26:29,038 --> 00:26:33,839
time right ryan

721
00:26:31,839 --> 00:26:36,240
and some of our trials yeah that's that

722
00:26:33,839 --> 00:26:37,918
that was our go-to

723
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:40,159
we were fortunate to have one that was

724
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:42,159
kind of side mounted so we i noticed in

725
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:44,720
your case you you had it on the rear

726
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:46,799
right so you're driving over the cover

727
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:49,839
crop prior to you know

728
00:26:46,798 --> 00:26:51,278
trying to roll it i don't know if that

729
00:26:49,839 --> 00:26:52,720
um

730
00:26:51,278 --> 00:26:54,960
you didn't try to drive backwards or

731
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:56,159
anything like that did you

732
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:58,480
yeah

733
00:26:56,159 --> 00:27:00,799
that's that's an issue with with with

734
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:02,640
mowing or or rolling

735
00:27:00,798 --> 00:27:05,440
for determination i guess

736
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:07,120
yeah i mean if you if you have a heavier

737
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:10,720
tractor and

738
00:27:07,119 --> 00:27:13,359
the flail mower is behind the tires

739
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:14,960
that area does not get flail molds as

740
00:27:13,359 --> 00:27:16,959
well of course

741
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:19,278
um there are not too many front mounted

742
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:21,200
flail mowers around um

743
00:27:19,278 --> 00:27:25,119
that i that i am aware of

744
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:25,120
so sight mounting uh definitely helps

745
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:29,038
well good afternoon everyone and thank

746
00:27:27,119 --> 00:27:30,158
you very much for having me here today

747
00:27:29,038 --> 00:27:33,359
ryan

748
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:36,640
um to talk to you about the potential of

749
00:27:33,359 --> 00:27:40,479
rye mulch to suppress white mold in

750
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:42,480
no-till soybean and dry bean

751
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:45,519
and today i'm going to give you a basic

752
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:47,360
overview of the white mold facts so

753
00:27:45,519 --> 00:27:49,839
we're concentrating on the disease white

754
00:27:47,359 --> 00:27:51,918
mold and we'll just review some of the

755
00:27:49,839 --> 00:27:53,599
strategies and tactics to control the

756
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:56,240
disease and that leads into the

757
00:27:53,599 --> 00:27:58,398
rationale for our experiment looking at

758
00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:00,880
the potential for rolled crimp cereal

759
00:27:58,398 --> 00:28:03,519
rye to add to the control of this

760
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:05,600
disease in leguminous crops

761
00:28:03,519 --> 00:28:07,519
we'll then talk about the field trials

762
00:28:05,599 --> 00:28:10,480
specifically we've been doing this for

763
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:12,480
several years at geneva and the results

764
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:14,159
have been consistent

765
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:15,759
we'll talk about the rationale we'll

766
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:18,399
talk about how we designed the

767
00:28:15,759 --> 00:28:20,960
experiment and our approach and some of

768
00:28:18,398 --> 00:28:23,599
the results not just on disease but also

769
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:26,880
on the trade-offs of weed suppression

770
00:28:23,599 --> 00:28:28,000
and on crop biomass and on yield pod

771
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:30,000
yield

772
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:33,119
and we'll talk about the implications of

773
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:36,000
our findings for disease management

774
00:28:33,119 --> 00:28:38,639
in leguminous crops

775
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:41,278
so just as a refresher white mold is

776
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:43,200
caused by the fungus sclerotinia

777
00:28:41,278 --> 00:28:45,119
scleroderm

778
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:47,759
you may know the symptoms of this

779
00:28:45,119 --> 00:28:50,959
disease already this white cottony

780
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:53,359
fluffy mycelia that you'll find on pods

781
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:54,480
of dry beans and soya beans and snap

782
00:28:53,359 --> 00:28:56,959
beans

783
00:28:54,480 --> 00:29:00,240
but the fungus has a very broad host

784
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:01,440
range so it can infect over 400 plant

785
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:03,679
species

786
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:05,759
many of which are vegetables and field

787
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:09,840
crops found in our new york cropping

788
00:29:05,759 --> 00:29:12,720
rotations which makes rotating out to a

789
00:29:09,839 --> 00:29:13,439
non-host quite problematic to

790
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:15,600
to

791
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:19,200
provide an opportunity to potentially

792
00:29:15,599 --> 00:29:21,918
reduce the inoculum density in the soil

793
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:22,798
now often crops have very low tolerance

794
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:25,440
for

795
00:29:22,798 --> 00:29:26,879
white mold for example in snap bean

796
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:29,440
crops the

797
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:31,440
tolerance for crop rejection could be as

798
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:33,759
low as two percent

799
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:35,919
so over that two percent threshold if

800
00:29:33,759 --> 00:29:37,679
pods are affected that could lead to

801
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:40,720
crop bypass

802
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:43,519
so it's important to get the management

803
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:45,519
very correct

804
00:29:43,519 --> 00:29:48,319
so why do we worry about white mold

805
00:29:45,519 --> 00:29:51,359
apart from crop bypassing well we have

806
00:29:48,319 --> 00:29:54,158
direct crop loss in those crops

807
00:29:51,359 --> 00:29:56,639
so the disease causes premature pod

808
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:58,240
abscission so they just fall off before

809
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:00,720
we get to harvest them

810
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:02,558
and reducing so we reduce the number of

811
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:05,038
harvestable pods

812
00:30:02,558 --> 00:30:07,038
we can also reduce the number of beans

813
00:30:05,038 --> 00:30:09,919
per pod because even though pods might

814
00:30:07,038 --> 00:30:12,879
be harvested they would have less energy

815
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:15,679
going into those pods and therefore less

816
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:17,919
beans being formed within the pods

817
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:19,759
and sometimes the beans might be formed

818
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:22,000
but they have a poor quality that

819
00:30:19,759 --> 00:30:23,839
because they didn't have enough energy

820
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:27,038
during formation they might be quite

821
00:30:23,839 --> 00:30:28,678
shriveled and not suitable for sale

822
00:30:27,038 --> 00:30:32,158
but we also have to consider

823
00:30:28,679 --> 00:30:34,720
contamination of the fungal parts

824
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:36,720
such as the sclerosis these black

825
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:38,000
resting bodies of the fungus that you

826
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:40,558
see here

827
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:42,798
in the beans so that slows down the

828
00:30:40,558 --> 00:30:45,278
process of sorting out beans from

829
00:30:42,798 --> 00:30:48,839
sclerosia because of course no one wants

830
00:30:45,278 --> 00:30:52,240
to find sclerosis in their can of dried

831
00:30:48,839 --> 00:30:55,038
beans but there's a direct crop losses

832
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:55,839
but there's also indirect crop losses as

833
00:30:55,038 --> 00:30:57,519
well

834
00:30:55,839 --> 00:30:59,918
when we get the production of this

835
00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:02,159
corrosion the resting body of the fungus

836
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:04,960
that survives in the soil

837
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:07,120
on the disease plant parts they fall

838
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:09,519
back into the soil surface

839
00:31:07,119 --> 00:31:12,398
and then form the inoculum for the next

840
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:15,200
susceptible crops in the rotation

841
00:31:12,398 --> 00:31:18,000
so it's setting up disease loss for

842
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:23,440
future crops as well so we have to think

843
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:23,440
about direct and indirect crop losses

844
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:29,120
so for white mold we for all diseases we

845
00:31:26,798 --> 00:31:31,440
can represent diseases by this disease

846
00:31:29,119 --> 00:31:32,398
triangle so we have the role of the

847
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:34,399
pathogen

848
00:31:32,398 --> 00:31:36,639
the role of the environment

849
00:31:34,398 --> 00:31:39,278
and the role of the plant and all those

850
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:42,159
three factors have to come together to

851
00:31:39,278 --> 00:31:45,200
get disease in your crop

852
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:47,200
for white mold the pathogen we consider

853
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:50,080
is usually sufficient

854
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:51,600
in the soil at sufficient densities to

855
00:31:50,079 --> 00:31:55,038
cause disease

856
00:31:51,599 --> 00:31:57,359
so we can't alter management too much by

857
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:58,720
trying to reduce the pathogen level in

858
00:31:57,359 --> 00:32:01,278
most cases

859
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:02,640
mostly because of that very broad host

860
00:32:01,278 --> 00:32:05,038
range

861
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:07,679
the plants there's really no significant

862
00:32:05,038 --> 00:32:11,278
resistance or immunity within many of

863
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:12,640
our crop species including legumes given

864
00:32:11,278 --> 00:32:14,960
as crops

865
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:16,880
and the environment well that really

866
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:18,399
regulates whether we get a white mold

867
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:21,679
epidemic or not

868
00:32:18,398 --> 00:32:24,319
so it requires very mild temperatures

869
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:26,159
very rainy type conditions which we are

870
00:32:24,319 --> 00:32:29,119
increasingly getting

871
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:30,799
um within our new york area

872
00:32:29,119 --> 00:32:33,599
so it's clearly that driven by that

873
00:32:30,798 --> 00:32:36,240
dominant influence in spring and summer

874
00:32:33,599 --> 00:32:39,359
conditions

875
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:41,679
the life cycle of the fungus starts as

876
00:32:39,359 --> 00:32:44,158
these black sclerosia

877
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:47,440
so this is the structure the fungus uses

878
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:49,360
to survive between seasons in the soil

879
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:52,640
it's basically just a wrapped up piece

880
00:32:49,359 --> 00:32:56,000
of mycelium and then they put this black

881
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:58,080
melonized hard coat around that to

882
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,599
dissuade any degradation by

883
00:32:58,079 --> 00:33:02,000
microorganisms

884
00:32:59,599 --> 00:33:04,639
and other environmental conditions

885
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,640
so that's the main driver of inoculum

886
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:08,960
for the disease

887
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:12,240
though sclerosia when the conditions are

888
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:14,480
right germinate into these what we call

889
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:17,120
apothecia but there's these little

890
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:18,720
mushroom type structures pale brown

891
00:33:17,119 --> 00:33:20,719
mushrooms

892
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:22,839
on the surface of those pale brown

893
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:25,839
mushrooms we get the production of

894
00:33:22,839 --> 00:33:29,678
ascospores which are basically colorless

895
00:33:25,839 --> 00:33:33,119
balls that are wind dispersed

896
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:34,480
those ascospores can then only infect

897
00:33:33,119 --> 00:33:36,398
the flowers

898
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:39,360
of our beans

899
00:33:36,398 --> 00:33:42,319
and then they use those dead dying

900
00:33:39,359 --> 00:33:45,519
flowers as a nutrient source to be able

901
00:33:42,319 --> 00:33:48,398
to infect the green tissue directly so

902
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:49,839
whether that be a pod whether that be a

903
00:33:48,398 --> 00:33:52,000
stem

904
00:33:49,839 --> 00:33:54,639
it can cause chaos on a variety of

905
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:58,159
different plant parts as long as that

906
00:33:54,640 --> 00:34:00,880
infected petal falls on that plant part

907
00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:03,039
and then we get the typical symptoms of

908
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:04,320
white mold these bleached necrotic

909
00:34:03,038 --> 00:34:06,480
lesions

910
00:34:04,319 --> 00:34:09,679
and the signs of the pathogen which are

911
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:11,119
these white cottony fluffy mycelia which

912
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:13,760
then ball up

913
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:16,559
become black and then fall onto the soil

914
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:18,159
surface again

915
00:34:16,559 --> 00:34:19,440
now i mentioned the role of the

916
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:21,599
environment

917
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:25,240
and this is really illustrated just for

918
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:27,039
example over the season between 2014 and

919
00:34:25,239 --> 00:34:27,799
2017.

920
00:34:27,039 --> 00:34:31,119
so

921
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:34,480
2014 it was a white mould year what so

922
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:36,000
to speak it was cool it was rainy all

923
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:37,599
year long and we got a lot of

924
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:40,639
significant loss

925
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:44,320
in our leguminous crops from white mold

926
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:46,960
in 2015 we didn't see much white mold

927
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:49,519
because it was cool but the rain

928
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:51,918
happened very early in the season so

929
00:34:49,519 --> 00:34:53,918
that affected crop stands

930
00:34:51,918 --> 00:34:56,719
which affected the microclimatic

931
00:34:53,918 --> 00:34:58,799
conditions later on so crops didn't

932
00:34:56,719 --> 00:35:01,118
reach their full potential and they

933
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:03,920
didn't get canopy closure

934
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:06,320
2016 the same happened but it was just

935
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:10,480
hot and dry all year round

936
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:13,200
and again in 2017 wet and cold

937
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:14,800
all season long and it was a white mold

938
00:35:13,199 --> 00:35:16,319
year so we get these dramatic

939
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:20,720
fluctuations

940
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:22,880
in white mold epidemics between years

941
00:35:20,719 --> 00:35:25,919
but what we do know for white mold is

942
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:29,039
that the inoculum comes predominantly

943
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:31,519
from within the field if the ascospores

944
00:35:29,039 --> 00:35:33,759
don't fly in from down the valley or

945
00:35:31,519 --> 00:35:36,159
generally the field next door

946
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:38,800
the inoculum or sclerosia that's in the

947
00:35:36,159 --> 00:35:40,639
soil in that field

948
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:43,119
contribute to

949
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:45,118
the ascospores that are being produced

950
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:47,599
and those ascospores

951
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:49,599
get caught by the crop canopy and are

952
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:52,240
able to cause disease

953
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:54,800
if the ascospores do escape the crop

954
00:35:52,239 --> 00:35:56,719
canopy and get into the wind currents

955
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:58,960
they're quickly broken down because

956
00:35:56,719 --> 00:36:01,279
they're colorless and they're able to be

957
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:02,240
degraded by ultraviolet light quite

958
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:03,119
quickly

959
00:36:02,239 --> 00:36:05,279
so

960
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:07,838
to concentrate on management we know

961
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:10,000
that we need to concentrate our efforts

962
00:36:07,838 --> 00:36:13,279
on trying to reduce the sclerosis

963
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:15,039
density within the field itself

964
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:16,960
which gets back to our rock to our

965
00:36:15,039 --> 00:36:19,679
potential for using

966
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:23,039
rolled crimp cereal rye to control white

967
00:36:19,679 --> 00:36:25,759
mold in a field

968
00:36:23,039 --> 00:36:27,838
so in terms of management for white mold

969
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:30,320
this is what we know so far

970
00:36:27,838 --> 00:36:33,039
we've got these strategies so things

971
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:36,000
that we can do prior to planting to

972
00:36:33,039 --> 00:36:37,838
reduce the sclerosis inoculum and reduce

973
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:40,239
the risk of disease

974
00:36:37,838 --> 00:36:43,440
and we also have tactics things that we

975
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:45,598
can do within the season as well so

976
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:47,679
let's take a closer look at that before

977
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:51,838
we move into the rationale for our royal

978
00:36:47,679 --> 00:36:54,000
trench cereal rye research

979
00:36:51,838 --> 00:36:55,279
so for strategies we know that

980
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:58,559
increasing

981
00:36:55,280 --> 00:37:00,480
our frequency of non-hosts if we've had

982
00:36:58,559 --> 00:37:01,679
a problem with white mold in that field

983
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:04,240
in the past

984
00:37:01,679 --> 00:37:06,719
is going to reduce the scrotial inoculum

985
00:37:04,239 --> 00:37:09,199
because they won't have an opportunity

986
00:37:06,719 --> 00:37:12,239
to infect those hosts

987
00:37:09,199 --> 00:37:14,399
the only real non-hosts in our cropping

988
00:37:12,239 --> 00:37:16,078
rotations unfortunately

989
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:18,000
are corn

990
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:21,119
and grain

991
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:23,838
now if we do rotate to those crops to

992
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:27,039
get the full benefit problem in terms of

993
00:37:23,838 --> 00:37:29,838
reducing our sclerosis inoculum we also

994
00:37:27,039 --> 00:37:32,559
need to think about weed control because

995
00:37:29,838 --> 00:37:36,000
many of our broad leaf weeds are also

996
00:37:32,559 --> 00:37:39,358
hosts to sclerotidy escaradiorum and can

997
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:41,199
also get diseased perform sclerosia and

998
00:37:39,358 --> 00:37:42,319
sclerosis fall back onto the soil

999
00:37:41,199 --> 00:37:44,319
surface

1000
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:47,039
so we need to think about weed control

1001
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:49,200
when rotating to these non-hosts so

1002
00:37:47,039 --> 00:37:50,639
we're not negating the effect of that

1003
00:37:49,199 --> 00:37:53,838
crop rotation

1004
00:37:50,639 --> 00:37:56,960
for disease control

1005
00:37:53,838 --> 00:37:59,679
and of course strategies we can also use

1006
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:01,358
techniques agronomic techniques that may

1007
00:37:59,679 --> 00:38:03,519
have trade-offs

1008
00:38:01,358 --> 00:38:06,319
for example we could use wider row

1009
00:38:03,519 --> 00:38:09,119
spacings if it fits planters and

1010
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:10,480
harvesters to get more airflow through

1011
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:13,760
the canopy

1012
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:17,039
we could use decreased plant populations

1013
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:20,400
as well but again trade-off with yield

1014
00:38:17,039 --> 00:38:23,039
less disease less yield

1015
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:25,760
we could also ensure that we get

1016
00:38:23,039 --> 00:38:28,400
effective weed management so we're not

1017
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:30,480
clogging up our rows with weeds so we

1018
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:33,519
can maximize the airflow through the

1019
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:36,559
crop canopy and if they're available we

1020
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:38,960
could use upright varieties again with

1021
00:38:36,559 --> 00:38:41,759
the main target of moving airflow

1022
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:41,760
through the canopy

1023
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:47,039
now we also have tactics within the

1024
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:49,519
season that we can use for example

1025
00:38:47,039 --> 00:38:52,000
fungicides so there's a range of

1026
00:38:49,519 --> 00:38:54,880
different fungicides in different frat

1027
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:57,280
groups or different fungicide resistant

1028
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:59,680
action committee groups so that

1029
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:02,160
represents different modes of action of

1030
00:38:59,679 --> 00:39:04,799
the fungicides that we could rotate

1031
00:39:02,159 --> 00:39:07,199
between if we wanted to consider

1032
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:09,760
synthetic fungicides for conventional

1033
00:39:07,199 --> 00:39:11,919
production

1034
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:14,640
but we also know from our research that

1035
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:17,200
to get the most out of our fungicides we

1036
00:39:14,639 --> 00:39:19,440
have to be really accurate with our

1037
00:39:17,199 --> 00:39:21,838
timing of that first application with

1038
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:24,639
early flowering because

1039
00:39:21,838 --> 00:39:26,480
covering and protecting our blossoms are

1040
00:39:24,639 --> 00:39:28,719
the critical point

1041
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:31,838
to because our blossoms serve as that

1042
00:39:28,719 --> 00:39:36,879
inoculum source after they fall from the

1043
00:39:31,838 --> 00:39:38,719
flowers onto the input other plant paths

1044
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:40,800
but we wanted to look at this the

1045
00:39:38,719 --> 00:39:43,358
potential control of white mold from a

1046
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:45,839
different angle instead of controlling

1047
00:39:43,358 --> 00:39:47,838
the flowers which most of our techniques

1048
00:39:45,838 --> 00:39:50,799
do through fungicides

1049
00:39:47,838 --> 00:39:54,239
we wanted to see if sclerosia could be

1050
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:57,280
inhibited from germinating to start with

1051
00:39:54,239 --> 00:40:00,078
so sclerosia are generally within the

1052
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:02,240
first top inch of the soil profile so

1053
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:03,280
those sclerosis that contribute to the

1054
00:40:02,239 --> 00:40:04,639
disease

1055
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:07,519
in the field

1056
00:40:04,639 --> 00:40:10,799
lower sclerosia in the soil profile

1057
00:40:07,519 --> 00:40:13,519
won't germinate um sufficiently long

1058
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:16,000
steaks what these these little stalks

1059
00:40:13,519 --> 00:40:17,679
containing the mushrooms to get to the

1060
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,440
soil surface

1061
00:40:17,679 --> 00:40:22,078
so we wanted to try

1062
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:24,559
and control or try and inhibit the

1063
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:28,000
germination of these sclerosis so we

1064
00:40:24,559 --> 00:40:30,799
don't get ascospores to start with

1065
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:33,599
so this is in principle done in other

1066
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:34,880
systems where for example in the pacific

1067
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:36,720
northwest

1068
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:39,358
they use chemication so they put

1069
00:40:36,719 --> 00:40:42,480
fungicides through the irrigation water

1070
00:40:39,358 --> 00:40:45,039
to do just this prevent the germination

1071
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:48,318
of sclerosis into these little mushroom

1072
00:40:45,039 --> 00:40:50,960
type structures to prevent ascospores

1073
00:40:48,318 --> 00:40:53,279
but we wanted to do it because through

1074
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:54,720
potentially cover crops

1075
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:57,519
as you know we don't have a lot of

1076
00:40:54,719 --> 00:41:00,159
irrigation infrastructure in new york

1077
00:40:57,519 --> 00:41:02,800
so what other ways could we

1078
00:41:00,159 --> 00:41:05,598
achieve the same aim and also get the

1079
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:09,200
benefits of cover crops in terms of soil

1080
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:11,440
health and climate resilience

1081
00:41:09,199 --> 00:41:14,480
so the objective of our research over

1082
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:17,280
the last few years has been to quantify

1083
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:18,318
the efficacy of rolled crimp cereal rye

1084
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:20,640
mulch

1085
00:41:18,318 --> 00:41:23,039
on white moulds specifically the major

1086
00:41:20,639 --> 00:41:26,318
disease of our leguminous crops

1087
00:41:23,039 --> 00:41:28,559
weed populations biomass and yield

1088
00:41:26,318 --> 00:41:31,519
because again we're interested in those

1089
00:41:28,559 --> 00:41:34,400
trade-offs between the biotic stresses

1090
00:41:31,519 --> 00:41:38,880
affecting our legumes disease and weeds

1091
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:38,880
and biomass and yield components

1092
00:41:39,039 --> 00:41:43,838
so when i'm talking about road crimped

1093
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:46,318
cereal rye i'm sure you know about this

1094
00:41:43,838 --> 00:41:49,199
potential one pass system

1095
00:41:46,318 --> 00:41:50,639
so we're planting our cereal right in

1096
00:41:49,199 --> 00:41:53,439
early fall

1097
00:41:50,639 --> 00:41:55,519
we're letting it grow in fall and then

1098
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:58,880
it will over winter

1099
00:41:55,519 --> 00:42:00,159
in spring it will bounce and grow very

1100
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:03,200
rapidly

1101
00:42:00,159 --> 00:42:05,838
and then we're rolling and crimping it

1102
00:42:03,199 --> 00:42:07,118
to achieve a mulch layer on the soil

1103
00:42:05,838 --> 00:42:09,519
surface

1104
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:12,318
so we're using a roller crimper bar as

1105
00:42:09,519 --> 00:42:13,838
you can see here it's basically just a

1106
00:42:12,318 --> 00:42:16,159
heavy cylinder

1107
00:42:13,838 --> 00:42:17,679
with these imprinted

1108
00:42:16,159 --> 00:42:20,399
rollers

1109
00:42:17,679 --> 00:42:23,919
imprinted in a chevron type pattern so

1110
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:26,318
when you go over the cereal rye it can

1111
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:29,599
kill it by crimping and damaging the

1112
00:42:26,318 --> 00:42:32,400
vascular tissue so it won't it will die

1113
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:34,160
in place when it's pushed down and forms

1114
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:37,119
that mulch layer

1115
00:42:34,159 --> 00:42:40,000
we can then do plant directly into that

1116
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:43,358
mulch layer either in a one pass system

1117
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:45,920
or it could also be in a two part system

1118
00:42:43,358 --> 00:42:48,559
so we thought it had application to

1119
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:49,838
directly harvested dry beans

1120
00:42:48,559 --> 00:42:52,078
because

1121
00:42:49,838 --> 00:42:54,880
for directly harvested dry beans they

1122
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:57,440
would be harvested in one pass

1123
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:59,920
so they would not need wind growing

1124
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:02,720
beforehand because the mulch layer could

1125
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:04,960
of course interrupt in that

1126
00:43:02,719 --> 00:43:06,559
wind rowing process

1127
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:08,960
and the system has already been

1128
00:43:06,559 --> 00:43:11,440
optimized in terms of its agronomic

1129
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:13,760
attributes for soybean so we were

1130
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:15,440
interested in a exploring this system

1131
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:18,079
for white mold controlling both

1132
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:22,400
susceptible crops but also looking at

1133
00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:22,400
could it be possible in dry bands

1134
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:26,480
so the rationale for this for white mold

1135
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:27,359
control

1136
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:30,800
is

1137
00:43:27,358 --> 00:43:33,358
that we would like to know whether the

1138
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:34,480
cereal rye mulch layer on the soil

1139
00:43:33,358 --> 00:43:37,519
surface

1140
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:38,960
has the ability to reduce light to the

1141
00:43:37,519 --> 00:43:41,599
soil surface

1142
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:44,880
because we know that light and the

1143
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:47,440
ratios of light quality are important in

1144
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:50,160
the germination of the sclerosia

1145
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:52,400
into these little epithecia

1146
00:43:50,159 --> 00:43:55,039
so by reducing the light perhaps we

1147
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:57,280
might get less germination

1148
00:43:55,039 --> 00:44:00,239
and even if they are formed perhaps at

1149
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:02,640
lower frequency we might get dilution of

1150
00:44:00,239 --> 00:44:04,879
the ascospores because it's harder for

1151
00:44:02,639 --> 00:44:08,400
them to be released into the wing

1152
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:10,720
currents through the rye mulch layer

1153
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:13,358
and of course there's other benefits in

1154
00:44:10,719 --> 00:44:15,039
the the rolled print rolled crimp cereal

1155
00:44:13,358 --> 00:44:17,199
rye mulch layer as well such as

1156
00:44:15,039 --> 00:44:19,759
potentially weed suppression

1157
00:44:17,199 --> 00:44:22,719
soil health moisture

1158
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:25,680
and reduced tillage as well so in

1159
00:44:22,719 --> 00:44:28,719
conventional systems every time we till

1160
00:44:25,679 --> 00:44:31,919
the soil we're essentially delivering a

1161
00:44:28,719 --> 00:44:34,838
new population of sclerosis to the soil

1162
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:37,599
surface and as we saw before those

1163
00:44:34,838 --> 00:44:39,679
sclerosis that are right on that soil

1164
00:44:37,599 --> 00:44:41,519
surface within an inch or so have the

1165
00:44:39,679 --> 00:44:44,799
potential to germinate

1166
00:44:41,519 --> 00:44:47,358
by bringing more sclerosis up we're just

1167
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:51,119
bringing new sclerosis for more disease

1168
00:44:47,358 --> 00:44:52,960
every season by tillage

1169
00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:55,358
so our trials were located at the

1170
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:57,679
research north facilities at cornell

1171
00:44:55,358 --> 00:44:59,838
agritech in geneva

1172
00:44:57,679 --> 00:45:03,679
what we did was we planted strips of

1173
00:44:59,838 --> 00:45:07,199
cereal rye it was cultivar arrow stuck

1174
00:45:03,679 --> 00:45:08,559
at three bushels per acre on the 18th of

1175
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:10,639
september

1176
00:45:08,559 --> 00:45:12,960
so we've done this over multiple years

1177
00:45:10,639 --> 00:45:14,960
but for ease of letting you know the

1178
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:16,838
results i'm just going to concentrate on

1179
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:21,519
the results of one

1180
00:45:16,838 --> 00:45:23,920
year our plots were 40 feet long by 204

1181
00:45:21,519 --> 00:45:26,800
feet wide in this season

1182
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:29,119
and we rolled and crimped our cereal rye

1183
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:31,839
on the 31st of may

1184
00:45:29,119 --> 00:45:34,800
as john paul said we didn't let it go to

1185
00:45:31,838 --> 00:45:38,159
seed we rolled and crimped it at 75

1186
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:41,119
percent and thesis to soft die stage

1187
00:45:38,159 --> 00:45:43,199
and our main crops were planted as a bit

1188
00:45:41,119 --> 00:45:45,760
later than we would have liked on the

1189
00:45:43,199 --> 00:45:47,439
7th of june because it managed to rain

1190
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:49,359
prolifically

1191
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:51,119
just after we rolled and crypt it the

1192
00:45:49,358 --> 00:45:53,199
day after

1193
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:56,000
we had two different crops

1194
00:45:53,199 --> 00:45:59,039
soya beans it was variety viking and

1195
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:01,199
black bean which was varieties in it and

1196
00:45:59,039 --> 00:46:04,639
we planted our black beans at the

1197
00:46:01,199 --> 00:46:07,519
commercial conventional no-till phase of

1198
00:46:04,639 --> 00:46:10,879
eight seeds per foot and both crops were

1199
00:46:07,519 --> 00:46:13,759
planted with a 30 inch row spacings so

1200
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:15,838
essentially we're comparing fallow areas

1201
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:18,960
that were not planted to cereal rye

1202
00:46:15,838 --> 00:46:21,199
mulch cereal rye in fall

1203
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:24,800
compared to our rolled crimped cereal

1204
00:46:21,199 --> 00:46:26,480
rye plots two treatments

1205
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:28,800
this is the process

1206
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:31,039
where we are you can see that the cereal

1207
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:32,560
rye has produced a huge amount of

1208
00:46:31,039 --> 00:46:34,960
biomass

1209
00:46:32,559 --> 00:46:36,000
since it's planting in fall and into

1210
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:38,000
spring

1211
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:41,599
and this is you can see our tractor

1212
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:43,838
going up and down our plots

1213
00:46:41,599 --> 00:46:47,440
rolling and crimping it into a mulch

1214
00:46:43,838 --> 00:46:47,440
layer on the soil surface

1215
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:51,760
this is what our plots looked like in

1216
00:46:50,239 --> 00:46:53,679
may so we had

1217
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:56,480
significant biomass and again we're

1218
00:46:53,679 --> 00:46:57,759
rotating our treatments up and down our

1219
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:59,358
field

1220
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:01,040
and this is what it looked like after

1221
00:46:59,358 --> 00:47:03,440
we'd rolled and gripped the entire

1222
00:47:01,039 --> 00:47:03,440
paddock

1223
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:08,639
so the first thing we wanted to

1224
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:10,479
have a look at was the effect of that

1225
00:47:08,639 --> 00:47:13,838
cereal rye mulch

1226
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:16,400
on plant density so crop populations

1227
00:47:13,838 --> 00:47:18,078
and we found that dry beans there was no

1228
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:20,639
significant effect

1229
00:47:18,079 --> 00:47:22,880
from the rye mulch the similar plant

1230
00:47:20,639 --> 00:47:26,239
density or plant populations in the

1231
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:28,880
fellow and the cereal rye mulch plots

1232
00:47:26,239 --> 00:47:31,039
and surprisingly in the soya bean plots

1233
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:36,000
we did get 45

1234
00:47:31,039 --> 00:47:36,000
less plant density in the rye plots

1235
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:42,559
we also looked at crop biomass so once

1236
00:47:39,519 --> 00:47:45,358
we know how many plants have established

1237
00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:48,800
we wanted to look at their vega as well

1238
00:47:45,358 --> 00:47:51,440
and we did this mid-season 19th of july

1239
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:52,800
and later in the season on the 31st of

1240
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:56,318
august

1241
00:47:52,800 --> 00:48:00,480
so in dry beans in the 19th of july

1242
00:47:56,318 --> 00:48:02,880
mid-season we had significantly less 63

1243
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:05,199
percent less biomass in the rifles

1244
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:07,599
compared to our phthalo plots

1245
00:48:05,199 --> 00:48:09,519
and a similar effect on soybeans of

1246
00:48:07,599 --> 00:48:13,119
course we had that plant population

1247
00:48:09,519 --> 00:48:15,838
effect earlier in the season as well

1248
00:48:13,119 --> 00:48:19,280
but by the 31st of august there was no

1249
00:48:15,838 --> 00:48:22,239
significant effect on biomass from the

1250
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:25,359
between the mulch and the fella areas

1251
00:48:22,239 --> 00:48:27,838
in dry beans but we still had a legacy

1252
00:48:25,358 --> 00:48:30,318
effect from that plant population and

1253
00:48:27,838 --> 00:48:32,239
potentially plant vigor effect

1254
00:48:30,318 --> 00:48:37,599
earlier on in the season in our soy

1255
00:48:32,239 --> 00:48:37,598
events 27 less in the rye plots

1256
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:42,800
now in terms of yield we

1257
00:48:40,318 --> 00:48:45,358
hand harvested plants within different

1258
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:47,839
subsamples across our trees

1259
00:48:45,358 --> 00:48:50,719
and we looked at pod weight and pod

1260
00:48:47,838 --> 00:48:53,119
number on the 12th of september

1261
00:48:50,719 --> 00:48:55,519
so for dry beans we did get a

1262
00:48:53,119 --> 00:48:58,480
significant increase

1263
00:48:55,519 --> 00:49:00,960
in pod weight in the rye plots

1264
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:02,880
but pod number was not significantly

1265
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:05,119
different between the treatments so

1266
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:06,079
potentially we had significantly heavier

1267
00:49:05,119 --> 00:49:08,240
pods

1268
00:49:06,079 --> 00:49:11,440
because we had the same number

1269
00:49:08,239 --> 00:49:14,000
whereas in our soya beans we have our

1270
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:17,039
pod weight was again reduced in our rye

1271
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:19,358
clots by nearly 30 percent and our pod

1272
00:49:17,039 --> 00:49:21,679
number was not significantly different

1273
00:49:19,358 --> 00:49:24,078
between the rock mulch and the fallow

1274
00:49:21,679 --> 00:49:24,078
plots

1275
00:49:24,159 --> 00:49:29,440
now we also had some we've seen

1276
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:32,000
repeatedly some interesting

1277
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:35,200
crop maturity effects especially in

1278
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:36,159
soybeans as well from the rye plots

1279
00:49:35,199 --> 00:49:38,960
so

1280
00:49:36,159 --> 00:49:42,078
in this section we have

1281
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:45,199
the in the foreground of the picture

1282
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:47,920
you can see our rye mulch plot and the

1283
00:49:45,199 --> 00:49:49,919
crop is still green and kicking on this

1284
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:52,800
is well into september

1285
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:56,880
whereas in our fellow area we're getting

1286
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:58,640
senescence of our crop in soya beans so

1287
00:49:56,880 --> 00:50:00,880
potentially the

1288
00:49:58,639 --> 00:50:03,118
rolled mulch the

1289
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:04,400
the rye mulch plots held onto moisture

1290
00:50:03,119 --> 00:50:05,280
for longer

1291
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:08,960
which

1292
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:08,960
made the crop kick on for longer

1293
00:50:09,679 --> 00:50:16,239
now we also saw a significant impact on

1294
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:17,519
weed suppression from our

1295
00:50:16,239 --> 00:50:20,479
rye plots

1296
00:50:17,519 --> 00:50:22,639
so in terms of broad leaf weed biomass

1297
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:23,838
at the end of the season on the 21st of

1298
00:50:22,639 --> 00:50:27,199
september

1299
00:50:23,838 --> 00:50:30,799
we had a significant weed population in

1300
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:32,879
our crop but there was 65 percent less

1301
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:34,880
in the rye plots than the fallow so we

1302
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:37,920
were doing a good job with wheat

1303
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:39,519
suppression and was the case in soybeans

1304
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:40,400
as well probably

1305
00:50:39,519 --> 00:50:43,358
higher

1306
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:44,960
in soya beans probably because it was a

1307
00:50:43,358 --> 00:50:47,920
a much more

1308
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:49,039
lush canopy and which probably provided

1309
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:52,000
more

1310
00:50:49,039 --> 00:50:53,199
weed suppression on its own as well

1311
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:55,838
but let's

1312
00:50:53,199 --> 00:50:58,480
get to the crux of the issue which was

1313
00:50:55,838 --> 00:51:01,039
what was the effect on white mold

1314
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:03,838
so we looked at the incidence of

1315
00:51:01,039 --> 00:51:07,358
white mold on plants and pods in the

1316
00:51:03,838 --> 00:51:10,639
mulch plots versus the fallow blocks

1317
00:51:07,358 --> 00:51:13,759
and in soya beans we had an incidence

1318
00:51:10,639 --> 00:51:16,000
in the fallow plots of 8.4 percent

1319
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:18,000
we could not find white mold in the

1320
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:20,159
varied plots

1321
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:22,559
similar effects in the dry beans

1322
00:51:20,159 --> 00:51:24,960
significantly higher incidence of white

1323
00:51:22,559 --> 00:51:28,640
mold on plants in the phthalo plots

1324
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:28,639
compared to the rye plots

1325
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:34,400
now to look at the effect of the

1326
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:37,280
cereal rye on spirocia

1327
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:39,039
we dug into the ground at six sand

1328
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:41,440
filled pots which we filled with

1329
00:51:39,039 --> 00:51:43,358
sclerosis six per plot

1330
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:45,358
now these sclerosis were ready to

1331
00:51:43,358 --> 00:51:46,719
germinate once they had the correct

1332
00:51:45,358 --> 00:51:49,039
conditions

1333
00:51:46,719 --> 00:51:51,598
so that we pro condition them in the

1334
00:51:49,039 --> 00:51:55,039
laboratory to be able to make them ready

1335
00:51:51,599 --> 00:51:55,039
to germinate if they can

1336
00:51:55,280 --> 00:52:00,000
so let's look at the results of that so

1337
00:51:57,440 --> 00:52:02,880
what we were looking at for was whether

1338
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:04,960
the sclerosis had germinated and if they

1339
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:07,119
had germinated properly

1340
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:09,199
so by that i mean that they've

1341
00:52:07,119 --> 00:52:12,400
germinated with their small stipes the

1342
00:52:09,199 --> 00:52:15,439
stool stalks plus the disc the apothecia

1343
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:18,079
which contains those asca spores

1344
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:20,720
so what we found was consistent between

1345
00:52:18,079 --> 00:52:22,880
the soya beans and the black beans

1346
00:52:20,719 --> 00:52:26,239
so for example the incidence of

1347
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:29,039
germination that resulted in fully

1348
00:52:26,239 --> 00:52:30,479
formed apothecia with that disc and

1349
00:52:29,039 --> 00:52:32,960
ascospores

1350
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:36,559
was significantly higher in our fallow

1351
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:39,358
plots compared to our rye mulch plots

1352
00:52:36,559 --> 00:52:42,720
also this case in black bean but the

1353
00:52:39,358 --> 00:52:44,799
opposite was true for non-functional

1354
00:52:42,719 --> 00:52:46,719
production of starts so by

1355
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:49,039
non-functional again i mean that the

1356
00:52:46,719 --> 00:52:51,759
sclerosia have germinated but they did

1357
00:52:49,039 --> 00:52:53,199
not form that disc and therefore no

1358
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:54,480
asterospores

1359
00:52:53,199 --> 00:52:57,358
so we have

1360
00:52:54,480 --> 00:53:00,480
more in the cereal rye plots compared to

1361
00:52:57,358 --> 00:53:03,440
the fallow plots in both the soya beans

1362
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:05,519
and the black veins

1363
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:08,240
so this is what they look like

1364
00:53:05,519 --> 00:53:10,800
so just as a reminder we have

1365
00:53:08,239 --> 00:53:14,159
in the rye plots reductions

1366
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:17,359
in the functional apatheti the incidence

1367
00:53:14,159 --> 00:53:21,920
of these and this is what a functional

1368
00:53:17,358 --> 00:53:24,960
apothecia looks like fully expand disk

1369
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:27,200
but significant increases in the

1370
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:29,440
sclerosis that are germinated to

1371
00:53:27,199 --> 00:53:32,239
non-functional stipes and this is what

1372
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:34,880
they look like so they germinate they're

1373
00:53:32,239 --> 00:53:37,759
reaching for the sky but they just don't

1374
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:40,318
have enough energy to be able to produce

1375
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:43,440
their apothecia

1376
00:53:40,318 --> 00:53:45,838
so we believe this energy exhaustion of

1377
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:47,838
sclerosia could be potentially useful in

1378
00:53:45,838 --> 00:53:48,880
a no-till situation

1379
00:53:47,838 --> 00:53:50,799
because

1380
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:52,880
again those sclerosis that are only

1381
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:55,680
within the top inch contribute to

1382
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:58,800
disease and if we're not bringing up new

1383
00:53:55,679 --> 00:54:00,879
populations of sloshia by tillage

1384
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:03,760
we're going to essentially purge that

1385
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:05,838
upper layer of stereotype of sclerosis

1386
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:08,079
which could contribute to disease in

1387
00:54:05,838 --> 00:54:10,239
future crops which may lead to a

1388
00:54:08,079 --> 00:54:12,640
reduction in soil-borne inoculum so

1389
00:54:10,239 --> 00:54:16,479
that's one aspect of our further

1390
00:54:12,639 --> 00:54:16,480
research into this issue

1391
00:54:16,559 --> 00:54:20,880
so in summary there's fewer newer

1392
00:54:19,039 --> 00:54:22,880
fungicides fewer

1393
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:25,039
new tactics that can be used in

1394
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:26,559
conventional systems being produced on

1395
00:54:25,039 --> 00:54:28,000
the horizon

1396
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:30,240
but we believe

1397
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:33,199
not relying on one

1398
00:54:30,239 --> 00:54:35,118
um one tactic or one strategy

1399
00:54:33,199 --> 00:54:37,279
is the future especially for these

1400
00:54:35,119 --> 00:54:39,358
recalcitrant type diseases that have

1401
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:42,160
been with us for a long time

1402
00:54:39,358 --> 00:54:44,798
we need that systems types approach to

1403
00:54:42,159 --> 00:54:46,798
be able to make incremental gain in

1404
00:54:44,798 --> 00:54:49,280
disease control

1405
00:54:46,798 --> 00:54:52,000
rolled cramped cereal rye mulch could

1406
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:54,400
offer that ability it provides weed

1407
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:55,838
suppression we've demonstrated white

1408
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:58,559
mold control

1409
00:54:55,838 --> 00:54:59,838
and potentially reductions in soil borne

1410
00:54:58,559 --> 00:55:02,079
inoculum

1411
00:54:59,838 --> 00:55:04,558
but the system needs to be abdominal

1412
00:55:02,079 --> 00:55:07,359
optimized for its agronomic attributes

1413
00:55:04,559 --> 00:55:09,359
with yield

1414
00:55:07,358 --> 00:55:12,078
so with that i'd like to acknowledge the

1415
00:55:09,358 --> 00:55:14,400
fantastic help of my own team the evade

1416
00:55:12,079 --> 00:55:16,079
team usually seen here

1417
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:18,880
also the funding of the new york state

1418
00:55:16,079 --> 00:55:20,559
driving council and usda organic

1419
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:22,640
transitions program

1420
00:55:20,559 --> 00:55:24,640
and our collaborators from the ryan

1421
00:55:22,639 --> 00:55:27,118
program and also brian brown from the

1422
00:55:24,639 --> 00:55:28,480
new york state ipm program

1423
00:55:27,119 --> 00:55:31,519
thank you

1424
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:32,838
i will stop sharing yeah

1425
00:55:31,519 --> 00:55:35,440
wow super

1426
00:55:32,838 --> 00:55:37,519
innovative work there and applications

1427
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:40,240
of the

1428
00:55:37,519 --> 00:55:44,000
roll rye system it's great to learn what

1429
00:55:40,239 --> 00:55:44,000
you're finding there i'm gonna

1430
00:55:44,798 --> 00:55:48,480
take a look at the time we have several

1431
00:55:46,559 --> 00:55:50,720
minutes for questions first due to end

1432
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:53,440
around 105 so i do invite folks to use

1433
00:55:50,719 --> 00:55:55,118
the chat one question that's in there is

1434
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:57,039
how do you think snappings would do in

1435
00:55:55,119 --> 00:55:58,559
this system

1436
00:55:57,039 --> 00:56:01,358
yeah actually i'm going to throw that

1437
00:55:58,559 --> 00:56:03,440
question back to you steve

1438
00:56:01,358 --> 00:56:04,318
would they be do you think they would be

1439
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:07,119
held

1440
00:56:04,318 --> 00:56:08,719
upright enough for the direct harvest

1441
00:56:07,119 --> 00:56:10,000
um i guess it would depend upon the

1442
00:56:08,719 --> 00:56:12,318
cultivar

1443
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:17,599
um probably depend on the cultivar it

1444
00:56:12,318 --> 00:56:18,880
could work it's fascinating yeah

1445
00:56:17,599 --> 00:56:21,680
i just hope they don't get more

1446
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:24,240
susceptible to root rots because it's um

1447
00:56:21,679 --> 00:56:26,480
if there's more moisture underneath that

1448
00:56:24,239 --> 00:56:28,639
good rotation would be the key there

1449
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:30,639
yeah

1450
00:56:28,639 --> 00:56:32,239
this is anecdotal and uh sean paul

1451
00:56:30,639 --> 00:56:35,279
speaking but um

1452
00:56:32,239 --> 00:56:36,239
we did in 2017 successfully grew snap

1453
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:38,960
beans

1454
00:56:36,239 --> 00:56:40,479
uh through cereal rye and we thought the

1455
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:43,358
difficulty would be

1456
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:44,559
um that uh cereal vibe would be picked

1457
00:56:43,358 --> 00:56:47,039
up by the

1458
00:56:44,559 --> 00:56:49,519
bean harvester that was not the case at

1459
00:56:47,039 --> 00:56:51,199
all there was no trash coming into the

1460
00:56:49,519 --> 00:56:53,358
harvester

1461
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:54,879
and also we had actually relatively good

1462
00:56:53,358 --> 00:56:58,239
germination there

1463
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:59,920
um but again this is only one year

1464
00:56:58,239 --> 00:57:02,719
yeah that's really interesting thank you

1465
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:02,720
thanks john paul

1466
00:57:04,719 --> 00:57:07,439
sarah you shared results from the one

1467
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:09,838
year

1468
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:11,920
were there was there much variation in

1469
00:57:09,838 --> 00:57:13,519
this trial from from year to year and

1470
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:14,960
anything okay

1471
00:57:13,519 --> 00:57:17,199
there wasn't we actually had very

1472
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:18,559
similar results over two years which

1473
00:57:17,199 --> 00:57:20,480
we've published

1474
00:57:18,559 --> 00:57:23,040
um but we're moving on to another

1475
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:24,719
experiment to determine if it's the rye

1476
00:57:23,039 --> 00:57:28,000
residue itself

1477
00:57:24,719 --> 00:57:30,318
um or is it just rye for example

1478
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:32,318
producing inhibitory effects

1479
00:57:30,318 --> 00:57:35,199
so with this time we have different

1480
00:57:32,318 --> 00:57:38,558
treatments of just fallow versus the

1481
00:57:35,199 --> 00:57:41,439
royal print cereal rye mulch versus

1482
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:42,960
tilling in the rye as well before

1483
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:45,119
planting

1484
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:47,440
so is it an allelopathic effect from the

1485
00:57:45,119 --> 00:57:47,440
rye

1486
00:57:47,519 --> 00:57:51,679
and we're also moving into determining

1487
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:54,160
to looking at this crop for white mole

1488
00:57:51,679 --> 00:57:56,879
controlling sunflowers as well it's also

1489
00:57:54,159 --> 00:57:59,440
a significant disease

1490
00:57:56,880 --> 00:58:01,440
that's super interesting i these this

1491
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:02,639
concept of

1492
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:04,798
of

1493
00:58:02,639 --> 00:58:07,118
of sclerosia in the soil and then

1494
00:58:04,798 --> 00:58:09,358
bringing them back up

1495
00:58:07,119 --> 00:58:10,400
to the surface i mean the analogy that i

1496
00:58:09,358 --> 00:58:12,318
was

1497
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:14,000
went straight to my mind was in was in

1498
00:58:12,318 --> 00:58:16,079
weed management and bringing new weed

1499
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:17,838
seeds to the surface and bringing

1500
00:58:16,079 --> 00:58:19,359
new sclerosis to the soil service

1501
00:58:17,838 --> 00:58:21,838
there's a lot of those analogies how

1502
00:58:19,358 --> 00:58:25,199
long can the sclerosis reside in the

1503
00:58:21,838 --> 00:58:27,039
soil um yeah we've actually got a

1504
00:58:25,199 --> 00:58:28,159
much of the data on that is from the

1505
00:58:27,039 --> 00:58:29,519
midwest

1506
00:58:28,159 --> 00:58:31,358
where you know it's very different

1507
00:58:29,519 --> 00:58:33,599
conditions so we've set up our own

1508
00:58:31,358 --> 00:58:36,639
experiment which has been going two

1509
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:39,200
years now and so far they're kicking on

1510
00:58:36,639 --> 00:58:40,558
just fine

1511
00:58:39,199 --> 00:58:42,879
if they're

1512
00:58:40,559 --> 00:58:44,000
there's more degradation in sclerosia at

1513
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:46,880
depth

1514
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:49,280
rather than on the surface

1515
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:51,760
you know presumably they're more

1516
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:54,319
capable of being eaten so to speak

1517
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:57,040
biodegraded by different microorganisms

1518
00:58:54,318 --> 00:58:59,920
in the soil so keeping them low

1519
00:58:57,039 --> 00:59:02,159
keeping them deep in the soil profile

1520
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:03,920
also will enhance their degradation so

1521
00:59:02,159 --> 00:59:05,589
far in our experiments we've got another

1522
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:08,240
year to go on that

1523
00:59:05,590 --> 00:59:12,000
[Music]

1524
00:59:08,239 --> 00:59:14,399
at least four to five years right

1525
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:16,159
great thing you're sorry it was a long

1526
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:19,160
version

1527
00:59:16,159 --> 00:59:19,159
very

1528
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:28,920
this has been a production of cornell
