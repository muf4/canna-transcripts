1
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:05,839
this is a production of cornell

2
00:00:03,198 --> 00:00:05,839
university

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,240
okay so today i just want to talk to you

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:14,320
guys a little bit about

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,000
my work on trying to model

6
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:18,640
a couple of different chromatin states

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,118
across species directly from dna

8
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:22,560
sequence and i'm using a flavor of deep

9
00:00:21,118 --> 00:00:24,320
learning model known as a recurrent

10
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:26,000
convolutional neural network

11
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,160
uh but before i get too deeply into that

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,920
i want to contextualize why we might

13
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,159
want to predict within state in the

14
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:34,480
first place

15
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:37,039
so we know that accessible chromatin

16
00:00:34,479 --> 00:00:39,519
regulates gene expression and most of

17
00:00:37,039 --> 00:00:40,878
the genome most of the time in vivo is

18
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,960
tightly wrapped around histones and

19
00:00:40,878 --> 00:00:45,359
heterochromatin but transcription

20
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,039
factors bind to this uh accessible

21
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:49,920
chromatin this open from it's gone to

22
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:51,359
regular gene expression

23
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,280
we also know that not all these

24
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:54,960
regulator regions are close to the genes

25
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,879
that they're targeting they can be up to

26
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,280
for example in mains up to 200 kilobases

27
00:00:56,878 --> 00:01:01,198
away so it's important not just to

28
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,640
localize to accessible regions close to

29
00:01:01,198 --> 00:01:06,000
genes but also figure out where they are

30
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,000
in the proportions of genome

31
00:01:06,478 --> 00:01:10,879
and so to put this all together we then

32
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:12,239
hypothesize that variation within these

33
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:13,759
accessible regions will lead the

34
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:15,599
variation of transcription factor

35
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,880
binding which will lead to variation in

36
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:18,319
gene expression and then go on to

37
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:20,719
influence all the phenotypes that we

38
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:20,719
care about

39
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:25,519
so as a more concrete example of this

40
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:27,759
there was a study in man across about 40

41
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:29,920
different traits and two populations

42
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:31,599
what they did was they took the

43
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,200
partition of the phenotypic variants

44
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:35,359
that's related to genetics and they

45
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,640
partitioned that further down to

46
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:38,640
snips that were associated with

47
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,239
different annotation classes

48
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,000
what we can see here is across both

49
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:43,599
populations about half of the variation

50
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,438
is attributable to sensitive encoding

51
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:47,039
regions and we expect this more protein

52
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:48,798
sequence is important

53
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,399
but what's also striking is that uh

54
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:52,159
variation within accessible regions is

55
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:54,159
almost as important as variation in

56
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:56,159
coding so this suggests to me that it's

57
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:57,759
also very important to

58
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:59,600
identify where these accessible regions

59
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:02,319
are if you want to include them improve

60
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:02,319
prediction models

61
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,640
another important probe in state is dna

62
00:02:04,478 --> 00:02:08,878
methylation and so a recent paper in

63
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,239
grasses showed that if you look at the

64
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:12,479
chromatin state

65
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:13,439
across different tissues

66
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:16,639
you can see that they're all

67
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:18,079
unmethylated um the accessible regions

68
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:19,519
and so

69
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,280
what we also know about

70
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,040
dna methylation stayed across

71
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,439
developmental times and it's very stable

72
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:27,359
and so the suggestion is that if we can

73
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:28,800
create dna methylation in a specific

74
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,120
tissue then that could potentially

75
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:34,640
capture the global potentially excessive

76
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,640
space across all tissues

77
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,560
so

78
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:40,399
predicting chromatin accessibility and

79
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,479
dna manipulation directly from sequence

80
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,480
we have a number of different benefits

81
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:46,159
the first one is a sequence based model

82
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:48,399
could be queried to highlight functional

83
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:50,959
sites and ranking yields it could be

84
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:53,039
similar to a verb score and really just

85
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:56,239
serve to narrow down to this top x

86
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:57,840
variance based on effect size

87
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:59,920
the second important point is if we get

88
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,360
good cross species models then we'd be

89
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:02,639
able to predict regulatory regions and

90
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,840
species that we haven't done these

91
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:05,598
assays and we only have genome

92
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,120
assemblies

93
00:03:05,598 --> 00:03:09,039
this could save time and money by

94
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:11,680
avoiding is relatively expensive from

95
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:11,679
its masses

96
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:16,158
so we know that these accessible regions

97
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:18,080
are expected to be enriched in

98
00:03:16,158 --> 00:03:19,598
transcription factor binding sites and

99
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,440
so we might use that as a signal to

100
00:03:19,598 --> 00:03:22,719
separately accessible for inaccessible

101
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:24,479
but unfortunately it's a very noisy

102
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:26,318
signal because we observe that there's a

103
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:28,079
lot of spurious matches to transcription

104
00:03:26,318 --> 00:03:30,318
fiber binding sites and inaccessible

105
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,120
regions that aren't functional

106
00:03:30,318 --> 00:03:33,199
so

107
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:35,039
my hypothesis was that maybe it's really

108
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:36,958
the order

109
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:38,719
relative orientation of these motifs

110
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:40,640
that serve as a stronger signal to help

111
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:42,239
differentiate accessible from

112
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:45,119
inaccessible

113
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:46,799
and what we also know is that these

114
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,799
transcription factor binding domains are

115
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:51,120
conserved across long evolutionary time

116
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:53,200
periods and so if we find location one

117
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,719
species we expect them to be observable

118
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:57,598
also in other species as well for

119
00:03:54,719 --> 00:03:57,598
transcription factor

120
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,239
and so uh convolutional neural networks

121
00:04:00,878 --> 00:04:04,959
have already been shown to be able to

122
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:07,438
predict chromatin state uh from sequence

123
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:09,519
within species at least in humans

124
00:04:07,438 --> 00:04:10,959
so we see at the bottom of dc which is a

125
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:12,480
pretty standard convolutional neural

126
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,719
network which is one of the first

127
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:16,238
applied to try and predict this problem

128
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:18,238
and it gets a range of word known as

129
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:20,719
aprs you can just think of as a metric

130
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:22,239
for classification performance from zero

131
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,120
to point eight

132
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,040
and then

133
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,399
the year after that dnq was released

134
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,919
which is a recurrent convolutional

135
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:30,159
neural network which shows improvement

136
00:04:27,918 --> 00:04:31,120
across almost all the test cases

137
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,639
um

138
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,319
the chromatin states and the tissues

139
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:36,400
that they've tested

140
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:37,199
um and so my question was can we then

141
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:38,799
use

142
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:40,879
dnq to

143
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:43,600
prevent chromatin accessibility across

144
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:44,319
species

145
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,840
so

146
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:48,240
the data they used to train the model

147
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:49,918
was ataxia data which basically causes

148
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,759
re-pilots underneath the accessible

149
00:04:49,918 --> 00:04:53,120
regions of the genome

150
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:55,040
then you can take what's known as a peak

151
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,399
color to then binarize this output and

152
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,919
get binary

153
00:04:56,399 --> 00:05:00,319
accessible sequence and accessible

154
00:04:57,918 --> 00:05:02,159
sequence regions

155
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:02,879
and then i take what's known as umrs

156
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,400
which

157
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:06,399
you do methylation sequencing on the

158
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:07,918
genome and you get a methylation state

159
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:10,000
for all three contexts of dna

160
00:05:07,918 --> 00:05:12,000
methylation you say if it's absent in

161
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,680
all three contexts

162
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,680
and so then again i have

163
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:18,478
binary on methylated and

164
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,478
methylated freedom

165
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:24,719
so in total i have training data from

166
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:26,240
about 12 different species for ataxi

167
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,600
spread nice and evenly across the

168
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,439
angiosperms

169
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,720
for the umr we have about 10 species

170
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:32,319
five of which are from the original

171
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,400
grasses paper and the five of which are

172
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:36,959
newly called for this word in the

173
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:36,959
bodybox

174
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,120
so just a quick overview of how i'm

175
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:43,120
going to model this i'm taking in 600

176
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,319
base pairs of sequence and i'm centering

177
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,560
it on the

178
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:48,879
umr the attack cpp and if it's shorter

179
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,399
than that i'll extend symmetrically from

180
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:51,839
the midpoint

181
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:53,519
i'll take it the name q which is that

182
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:55,839
recurrent uh convolutional neural

183
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:58,719
network an attempt to predict zero or

184
00:05:55,839 --> 00:06:02,399
one inaccessible or accessible

185
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,400
methylated or unoperated

186
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:06,799
i'm interested in comparing

187
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:09,038
canvas model we know it works within

188
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,800
species in humans but can it do as well

189
00:06:09,038 --> 00:06:11,839
across species in species it hasn't

190
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,199
observed

191
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:15,279
and for now i'm going to shorthand and

192
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:17,520
call this model a to z for arabidopsis

193
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:19,119
to see

194
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:21,439
so how does training aesi look like or

195
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:23,439
within species small so let's say you

196
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:24,560
want to do it with an arabidopsis scalia

197
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:26,560
so we're going to take a holdout

198
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,319
chromosome as a test set we're going to

199
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,560
assign these open and closed unlikely

200
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:32,080
method bins on that chromosome to that

201
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,360
test set

202
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:35,279
we'll assign the rest of the training

203
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,560
set then i'm going to bounce down from

204
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:38,000
my training set to make sure they're

205
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,000
equal across open and closed because

206
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,319
this is known to improve classification

207
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,918
training

208
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:45,840
after that down sampling is done my

209
00:06:43,918 --> 00:06:48,719
training set looks like this in terms of

210
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:50,799
magnitude 26 000 observations for

211
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:53,840
species with accessibility and about 36

212
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,840
000 for methylation

213
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:56,879
then when you evaluate the model in the

214
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,879
test set it looks something like this

215
00:06:56,879 --> 00:07:00,000
for accessibility we get an abr about

216
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:02,719
0.6

217
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:06,720
in rapid office transfer methylation a

218
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,720
little bit slightly better at 0.65

219
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:11,198
so for cross species we're going to

220
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:12,638
choose a test species of our test set

221
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:13,439
and we're going to take all of those

222
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:16,800
within

223
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:18,800
the test species as our test set

224
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,560
and then assign the rest of the species

225
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,919
into the training set

226
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,199
we're going to dom sample our training

227
00:07:21,918 --> 00:07:24,318
set

228
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:26,000
then we're going to train the model and

229
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:27,598
evaluate it and now we get a comparison

230
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,319
how well does within species of

231
00:07:27,598 --> 00:07:31,680
rhodopsidal do to the across species

232
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:34,319
model that hasn't seen rabidox's

233
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,319
sequence at all

234
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:38,638
and so when we look across both of these

235
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,560
features you see within its next

236
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:42,319
accessibility it's quite competitive it

237
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,319
does almost equally as well within

238
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:45,840
species as it of cross species

239
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:49,120
less than the case for methylation but

240
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:49,119
still very close

241
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,800
all right so here are the results across

242
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:57,038
both features and all my species in my

243
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:59,199
uh data set so

244
00:07:57,038 --> 00:08:01,038
what's very encouraging is that at least

245
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:03,840
in accessibility we see a very

246
00:08:01,038 --> 00:08:05,918
competitive uh comparison between the

247
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:08,478
crossfaces and within species models

248
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:10,000
it's either equal to or greater than the

249
00:08:08,478 --> 00:08:12,959
ability of the within species model

250
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,079
particularly in grasses with ventilation

251
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:16,878
the case is

252
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:18,478
not as strong but it's still there

253
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:20,800
across all the species that i've seen

254
00:08:18,478 --> 00:08:20,800
before

255
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:27,839
another thing i want to look at is

256
00:08:25,038 --> 00:08:30,079
whether or not or how large the effect

257
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:31,038
size is but of a certain transcription

258
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:32,639
factor

259
00:08:31,038 --> 00:08:34,319
and so the way i can do this is by using

260
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:35,519
a method called global importance

261
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,200
analysis

262
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:39,278
the way that works is i'll sample a

263
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:41,519
bunch of random background sequences in

264
00:08:39,278 --> 00:08:43,200
my case i did a thousand and i used the

265
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:44,799
base pair frequencies in accessible

266
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,000
regions across the genome to sample

267
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:48,559
these

268
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,958
and then what i do is i embed a jasper

269
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:52,319
motif which is a database of about 530

270
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:53,599
plant tfs

271
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,120
and i just asked the question what's the

272
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,600
difference in prediction

273
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:59,278
i do this for all a thousand and i take

274
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,240
the pairwise differences and i average

275
00:08:59,278 --> 00:09:02,240
that

276
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:04,000
and then i embed the motif at all

277
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:06,159
possible positions then i take the

278
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,559
maximum of that and that's my maximum

279
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:11,439
global importance score for a given tf

280
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:13,439
any given species in a given chromatin

281
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:15,920
state accessibility regulation

282
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:17,440
then i can rank these tfs by that value

283
00:09:15,919 --> 00:09:19,759
and then a table looks something like on

284
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,800
the right so the first thing to notice

285
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:22,720
is that

286
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:25,439
our accessibility between reminiscence

287
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:27,759
and maze we don't see um

288
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,600
similar patterns so we do see the tcp

289
00:09:27,759 --> 00:09:31,278
location rhetoxis are highly ranked for

290
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:34,800
accessibility

291
00:09:31,278 --> 00:09:36,240
we see uh in veins that it's also tcp is

292
00:09:34,799 --> 00:09:38,479
highly ranked in the top 10 but it's

293
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,519
also means dot type let's use

294
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,440
um

295
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:43,519
for the methylation side of things it's

296
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:45,760
it's more consistent you see basically

297
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:47,519
the et2 erf

298
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:49,039
matisse are highly ranked consistently

299
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:51,360
between both species

300
00:09:49,039 --> 00:09:54,159
as well as these bvr and bbc

301
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,159
family one twos

302
00:09:54,879 --> 00:09:58,399
so in conclusion i've shown that these

303
00:09:56,799 --> 00:09:59,838
recurrent neural nets can model

304
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:01,919
chromatin accessibility and dna

305
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:02,959
methylation from sequence and across

306
00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:04,399
species

307
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:06,000
these across species models are

308
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:07,839
competitive to models trained only

309
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,600
within species at least within the mds

310
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:11,839
firms

311
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:13,519
and the tcp family mates we saw are

312
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:15,680
entirely global importance to the across

313
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:17,679
species of accessibility walls

314
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:20,239
but for the methylation models it is ap2

315
00:10:17,679 --> 00:10:20,239
and erf

316
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,680
and i'm also happy to report that there

317
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:25,519
is a preprint available that shows what

318
00:10:23,679 --> 00:10:27,120
i've discussed here and also more on

319
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:28,799
bioarchive

320
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,919
um i've uploaded the data in the models

321
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:30,958
to xeno which are linked to the

322
00:10:29,919 --> 00:10:32,879
pre-print

323
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:34,319
and there's code on github which

324
00:10:32,879 --> 00:10:35,519
includes instructions for making your

325
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:38,320
own progressions in your favorite

326
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:40,159
species if you'd like

327
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:42,640
and finally i'd like to acknowledge uh

328
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:44,719
my community and eric for their guidance

329
00:10:42,639 --> 00:10:46,720
on my co-authors for all the workfields

330
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:48,560
in making this paper happen

331
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:51,600
particularly pete he called those extra

332
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:52,799
dipot uh unlimited reasons for him and

333
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,959
as well as the with that for all

334
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:55,759
their feedback and the funding sources

335
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:58,078
and

336
00:10:55,759 --> 00:11:00,958
high performance computing departments

337
00:10:58,078 --> 00:11:00,958
and without it behind

338
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:17,759
so i asked do you have better hp on

339
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:19,200
rhodopsis and rice compared with maize

340
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:20,720
and other species

341
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,920
does this mean the genome complexity of

342
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,759
playing a role yeah that's a great

343
00:11:21,919 --> 00:11:25,120
question i didn't show it here

344
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:27,919
but i do notice

345
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:29,519
um a trend so as genome size increases

346
00:11:27,919 --> 00:11:31,759
my performance

347
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:34,000
increases and what this boils down to is

348
00:11:31,759 --> 00:11:36,480
that the model um i also show this it

349
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,759
makes more false positive mistakes than

350
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,639
it does

351
00:11:37,759 --> 00:11:40,799
so

352
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:43,039
what i mean by false positive is

353
00:11:40,799 --> 00:11:44,639
the model calls it open but the data is

354
00:11:43,039 --> 00:11:46,639
labeled as closed

355
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:48,639
and so in these larger genomes that

356
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:49,679
effect is a lot more pronounced and so i

357
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:52,799
get

358
00:11:49,679 --> 00:11:54,078
less of an accuracy in those species um

359
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:56,879
there's a number of reasons why i think

360
00:11:54,078 --> 00:12:00,239
this is the case uh first

361
00:11:56,879 --> 00:12:02,000
the ataxi in the angiosperms was called

362
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,360
very conservatively

363
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,958
but there's a potential that the model

364
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:07,120
is calling things that are actually open

365
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:08,638
in vivo but just weren't able to be

366
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:10,399
captured in the

367
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:12,399
concerned certainly calling sort of

368
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:14,000
constraints um

369
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:15,919
yeah there's also a number of other

370
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,240
reasons but i hope that answers your

371
00:12:15,919 --> 00:12:18,240
question

372
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:24,639
um do you have a sense of how additive

373
00:12:21,759 --> 00:12:28,159
these motif effects tend to be they

374
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:30,159
should be fairly active um basically

375
00:12:28,159 --> 00:12:31,759
it's been shown so what's more important

376
00:12:30,159 --> 00:12:33,679
though actually is the businesses

377
00:12:31,759 --> 00:12:34,958
haven't shown the additive to an extent

378
00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:36,479
that they can

379
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:38,879
sort of interact with each other at the

380
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,920
regulatory site but what's more

381
00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:41,600
important is that they're trying to be

382
00:12:39,919 --> 00:12:44,399
redundant so if you start deleting these

383
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:46,480
motifs it doesn't necessarily mean that

384
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:50,278
expression will be impacted and so

385
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:50,278
that's also a few points

386
00:12:55,679 --> 00:13:03,319
this has been a production of cornell

387
00:12:58,078 --> 00:13:03,319
