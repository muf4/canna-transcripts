1
00:00:12,558 --> 00:00:18,320
I uh am going to talk about gasoline and

2
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:21,719
um and more and why we must replace fire

3
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:24,000
in our Energy System and I'm um going to

4
00:00:21,719 --> 00:00:25,919
give excerpts of a of a much longer

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,518
presentation and and hopefully I'll be

6
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,480
able to say what I need to say in my 15

7
00:00:28,518 --> 00:00:33,359
minutes here so

8
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:36,399
um another possible title for this is

9
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:39,759
firing fire why we need to cool down the

10
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:42,239
Energy System um and I'm going to start

11
00:00:39,759 --> 00:00:45,679
us off with a question about this block

12
00:00:42,238 --> 00:00:48,280
of graphite and graphite is pure carbon

13
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:50,119
it's the main ingredient in pencil lead

14
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:52,160
um on the slide there I got it with a

15
00:00:50,119 --> 00:00:55,599
quarter so you can see that it's 2 x two

16
00:00:52,159 --> 00:00:58,078
by six Ines and I want you to think

17
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:00,679
about how it compares to the amount of

18
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:04,640
carbon in a gallon of gasoline is it a

19
00:01:00,679 --> 00:01:06,560
lot less about the same a lot more and

20
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:09,478
if I wasn't in such a hurry I I'd do a

21
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:12,519
show of hands on that but uh I'm G to

22
00:01:09,478 --> 00:01:16,118
cut that out for the moment um this is

23
00:01:12,519 --> 00:01:19,319
also uh there are many sort of um

24
00:01:16,118 --> 00:01:20,159
descendant talks uh that that are all

25
00:01:19,319 --> 00:01:23,798
kind of

26
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:25,799
interrelated um and this is also some of

27
00:01:23,799 --> 00:01:27,520
this is also part of the talk fear is

28
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:30,439
our best hope moving from climate

29
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:33,039
anxiety to climate action um

30
00:01:30,438 --> 00:01:36,839
and oops that one I did want to go

31
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:39,960
on want to show of hands um is there a

32
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:43,280
climate emergency so um actually I can't

33
00:01:39,959 --> 00:01:45,280
see the participants so we'll just

34
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:47,320
imagine that most of you think that

35
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:51,439
there is a climate emergency I'm

36
00:01:47,319 --> 00:01:53,519
guessing that is the case um and another

37
00:01:51,438 --> 00:01:56,239
show of hands are you now or have you

38
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:58,319
ever been scared about climate change

39
00:01:56,239 --> 00:02:00,560
and again I'm guessing most of the hands

40
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:02,959
go up and

41
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:05,920
um a third question third and final for

42
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:08,719
this set here um is should we be honest

43
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:11,199
about our climate education and

44
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:14,039
communication efforts and again I'm

45
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:16,719
guessing most of you raised your hands

46
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:19,679
um my goals for today are to astonish

47
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:21,239
you um scare you not leave you scared

48
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,599
though but give you courage and motivate

49
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:25,920
you to act and give you some tools for

50
00:02:23,598 --> 00:02:28,759
upping your climate teaching and action

51
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:31,598
gain and now as I said I'm I'm going to

52
00:02:28,759 --> 00:02:36,519
skip ahead um um to the word of the day

53
00:02:31,598 --> 00:02:41,560
the word of the day is fire um and uh in

54
00:02:36,519 --> 00:02:45,400
the longer version of uh the slideshow I

55
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:48,360
um interspersed the um white slides with

56
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:51,319
black text with black text with wh white

57
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:54,360
text which is uh strategy slides and

58
00:02:51,318 --> 00:02:57,719
I'll share this presentation um uh

59
00:02:54,360 --> 00:03:00,040
before we're done today um and uh we're

60
00:02:57,719 --> 00:03:03,759
going to jump ahead again so skip most

61
00:03:00,039 --> 00:03:07,000
of the strategy slides to talk about one

62
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:08,598
kind of carbon dioxide source and that's

63
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,280
gasoline so we're going to think a bit

64
00:03:08,598 --> 00:03:14,238
about a gallon of gasoline Americans

65
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:16,840
burn 376 million gallons of gasoline on

66
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:19,360
the average day that dat is from

67
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:21,878
2023 um that's more than a gallon per

68
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:24,599
person per day which would make you say

69
00:03:21,878 --> 00:03:28,199
should make you say wow um and I'm going

70
00:03:24,598 --> 00:03:30,318
to throw around some big numbers and so

71
00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:33,119
um I want to take a brief Interruption

72
00:03:30,318 --> 00:03:35,598
to talk about scale um there's zero

73
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,959
there's a trillion if we were in person

74
00:03:35,598 --> 00:03:40,438
I'd have folks come up and and uh I

75
00:03:37,959 --> 00:03:42,680
would put zero on a Post-It note on one

76
00:03:40,438 --> 00:03:45,000
corner of the uh front wall of the room

77
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:47,040
and a a trillion on the other the

78
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,639
opposite corner of the front wall and

79
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:51,519
have everybody come up with posted U

80
00:03:49,639 --> 00:03:53,518
Notes with a billion on it and put it

81
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:57,519
where they think it goes since we're

82
00:03:53,519 --> 00:04:00,680
virtual I'll have you do that online

83
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:04,680
there and hopefully very very speedily

84
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:04,680
um so if you can take a moment and do

85
00:04:05,239 --> 00:04:10,560
that and for the sake of time I'm

86
00:04:08,199 --> 00:04:11,919
actually just going to fly by it but but

87
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,039
do that and we'll come back and look at

88
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:17,120
your uh

89
00:04:14,039 --> 00:04:19,319
responses um perhaps in a moment so

90
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:24,199
there's zero there's a

91
00:04:19,319 --> 00:04:26,319
trillion um and the uh correct answer is

92
00:04:24,199 --> 00:04:31,280
that everything goes in the first one

93
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:33,879
1000 of that length of the line um the

94
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:35,758
commonly um named numbers that we talk

95
00:04:33,879 --> 00:04:38,399
about pretty regularly a thousand a

96
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:40,280
billion trillion I skipped them a

97
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:42,918
thousand a million a billion and a

98
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:45,758
trillion each one of those is a thousand

99
00:04:42,918 --> 00:04:48,799
times larger than the one before it and

100
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:52,360
we don't generally get that very well so

101
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:56,038
this is um responses to that from an

102
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:59,038
earlier online session very typical uh

103
00:04:56,038 --> 00:05:01,800
responses there spread largely across

104
00:04:59,038 --> 00:05:04,120
the two first two-thirds of the line and

105
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:06,720
that of course is not right and not

106
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:11,360
understanding that has some consequences

107
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:13,400
for um for us to uh think about a lot of

108
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,439
issues with climate and energy and I I

109
00:05:13,399 --> 00:05:17,359
honestly think that if more people

110
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:19,918
understood scale the world would be a

111
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:23,080
much better place it's hard to

112
00:05:19,918 --> 00:05:26,359
understand scale um some strategies for

113
00:05:23,079 --> 00:05:30,240
working on that um I'll I'll share

114
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:32,160
quickly um and thinking about is

115
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,720
something that somebody's everybody is

116
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:38,400
familiar with and a th seconds is about

117
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:40,759
17 minutes a th times thousand again is

118
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:44,399
a million and a million seconds is about

119
00:05:40,759 --> 00:05:46,639
12 days so when you go from a thousand

120
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:49,399
to a million that's the the change we're

121
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:52,960
talking about and a thousand times a

122
00:05:49,399 --> 00:05:56,560
million um seconds brings us up to 32

123
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:58,359
years so there are some people on um

124
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:00,160
this call who are probably about a half

125
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:02,520
a billion seconds old since we've got

126
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,960
some students on here I am coming up on

127
00:06:02,519 --> 00:06:08,598
two billion seconds old um and a

128
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:10,638
trillion seconds is about 32,000 years

129
00:06:08,598 --> 00:06:13,519
and that goes back to before the dawn of

130
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:16,199
civilization and agriculture by most um

131
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:17,879
considerations and Homo sapiens us as a

132
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:21,120
species have been around for less than

133
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:22,759
10 trillion seconds less than 320,000

134
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:25,560
years I think the best guess right now

135
00:06:22,759 --> 00:06:28,120
is about 300,000 years for the dawn of

136
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:30,519
homo sapiens and that's an example of

137
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:34,800
social math which I'm not Linger on but

138
00:06:30,519 --> 00:06:38,399
it's a way of helping people um

139
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:41,560
understand uh big and small numbers so

140
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:44,918
back to uh gasoline now we burn again

141
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:47,839
about 376 million gallons a day and we

142
00:06:44,918 --> 00:06:50,359
want to think about where it goes and a

143
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:53,959
gallon of gas weighs a little over six

144
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:58,160
pounds um so you can maybe picture

145
00:06:53,959 --> 00:07:00,198
holding a 3/4 gallon or a gallon of

146
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:03,560
water that's 3/4 full

147
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:05,680
is water has a density about 3/4 that or

148
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:08,839
gasoline rather has a density of 3/4 out

149
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:13,400
of water so if you fill up a jug uh 3/4

150
00:07:08,839 --> 00:07:15,638
full that'll give you a a a a proxy for

151
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:17,318
uh thinking about that gasoline and if

152
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:20,759
you use 10 gallons a week where does

153
00:07:17,319 --> 00:07:22,240
that 60 pounds go well in order to

154
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:23,960
figure that out we need to know a bunch

155
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,519
of things first off we need to know that

156
00:07:23,959 --> 00:07:28,519
matter can neither be created nor

157
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:30,478
destroyed only changed in form and in

158
00:07:28,519 --> 00:07:31,839
order to figure out what's going on with

159
00:07:30,478 --> 00:07:34,839
it of course we need to know what

160
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:37,079
gasoline is it's a complex mixture of

161
00:07:34,839 --> 00:07:40,038
hydrocarbons um and on average its

162
00:07:37,079 --> 00:07:42,839
chemical formula is c18 and if we had

163
00:07:40,038 --> 00:07:47,360
more time I'd Pro you to give me a name

164
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:49,359
for that uh chemical um it's octane um

165
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:52,800
and what do you get when you burn octane

166
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:56,360
well you get carbon dioxide and water

167
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:59,598
and we're going to look at um at that in

168
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:01,720
cartoon form and I'll also note that I

169
00:07:59,598 --> 00:08:03,319
um made this presentation using Apple

170
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:05,199
keynote because I like their animations

171
00:08:03,319 --> 00:08:07,759
better than Powerpoints and now we're

172
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:10,919
going to we're going to run that

173
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:13,319
combustion reaction in a moment here

174
00:08:10,918 --> 00:08:16,359
there are our oxygen

175
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:18,039
molecules there's our octane molecule

176
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:19,800
and we're going to give it a

177
00:08:18,038 --> 00:08:23,959
spark

178
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:27,158
and comines so we end up with uh going

179
00:08:23,959 --> 00:08:29,519
from one octane molecule and 12 A2 o2

180
00:08:27,158 --> 00:08:32,838
molecules to eight carbon dioxide

181
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:36,399
molecules and nine water molecules and

182
00:08:32,839 --> 00:08:39,320
um when we look at those carbon dioxide

183
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:40,918
molecules and um there are the water

184
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:42,839
molecules but when we look at those

185
00:08:40,918 --> 00:08:44,720
eight carbon dioxide molecules and

186
00:08:42,839 --> 00:08:48,080
compare it to the octane molecule we

187
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:50,440
started with we can see that the CO2

188
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:53,360
weighs a lot more than the octane that

189
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:58,000
we started with that's not magic it's

190
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:59,800
chemistry um so it's uh pulling um

191
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,839
oxygen from the air it's not not just

192
00:08:59,799 --> 00:09:04,399
the gasoline to produce the carbon

193
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:07,079
dioxide so what that means is when you

194
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:10,360
burn this six pound gallon gasoline you

195
00:09:07,078 --> 00:09:14,159
end up producing 19 pounds of CO2 and we

196
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:16,440
do that in the US 376 million times a

197
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:19,439
day yeah uh as of

198
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:22,120
2023 and that's an example of the power

199
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:24,800
of surprise and I'm guessing most of you

200
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:27,320
are surprised by that um and as

201
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:30,199
Educators we should um think about how

202
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:32,440
to use surprise strategically and again

203
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:34,200
if we had more time I'd ask you for uh

204
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:37,079
examples of where you've learned things

205
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:39,360
by surprise and where you've taught by

206
00:09:37,078 --> 00:09:43,599
surprise um and again I'll share the

207
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:45,720
slide so you can get to that so now

208
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:48,480
we're going to think about that 19

209
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:50,160
pounds of CO2 it's a gallon of gas is

210
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:52,120
pretty easy to picture and doesn't seem

211
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:55,000
weird to think that it weighs n six

212
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:58,720
pounds but 19 pounds of an invisible gas

213
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:01,879
is a bit harder to understand um so

214
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:04,959
we're going to think about um gallon

215
00:10:01,879 --> 00:10:07,838
siiz balloons and how many gallon siiz

216
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:11,278
balloons it would take hold 19 pound of

217
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:14,360
CO2 so I've got a balloon here and if we

218
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:16,439
were in person I would hand some out um

219
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:18,278
and ask you to hold it empty and think

220
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:21,120
about how much it weighs then fill it up

221
00:10:18,278 --> 00:10:21,120
to about a gallon

222
00:10:24,519 --> 00:10:29,320
size normally I I have a gallon jug and

223
00:10:27,278 --> 00:10:31,519
I forgot to it out for this morning

224
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:33,879
morning or this afternoon um but that's

225
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:36,600
about the size of a gallon milk jug so

226
00:10:33,879 --> 00:10:40,480
how many of these do you think it would

227
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:41,759
take to hold 19 pounds of carbon dioxide

228
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,360
and of course you got to subtract the

229
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:46,200
weight of the balloon itself and just

230
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:49,519
think about the um contents of the

231
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:51,639
balloon so um so anybody want to put in

232
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:54,399
the the chat some guesses on how many

233
00:10:51,639 --> 00:10:58,240
balloons it would take to hold 19 pounds

234
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:59,720
of uh CO2 and you know a sort of helpful

235
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,799
thing along the way is to think about

236
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:04,480
some other things that weigh about 19

237
00:11:01,799 --> 00:11:07,000
lbs um and again for the sake of time

238
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:08,839
I'll just rattle that off U might be a

239
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,679
one- year-old child might be a really

240
00:11:08,839 --> 00:11:14,440
large cat like the larger of my two cats

241
00:11:11,679 --> 00:11:19,039
um a 20 pound bag of anything is in the

242
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:22,120
ballpark so how many balloons gallon

243
00:11:19,039 --> 00:11:25,039
siiz balloons would it take to hold 19

244
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:29,078
pounds and they'll just spill the beans

245
00:11:25,039 --> 00:11:31,000
it's about 1,00 that's a lot um and if

246
00:11:29,078 --> 00:11:33,559
we had 25 people here everybody would

247
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,679
have to blow up 44 since I think we're

248
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:39,199
about twice that everybody would have to

249
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:41,278
blow up something like um 20 balloons uh

250
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:43,959
in order for us to to get enough

251
00:11:41,278 --> 00:11:46,399
balloons to hold the carbon dioxide from

252
00:11:43,958 --> 00:11:48,518
burning one gallon of gas so we'll look

253
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:51,799
at that in animation form again there

254
00:11:48,519 --> 00:11:53,839
goes 100 balloons there's 200

255
00:11:51,799 --> 00:11:55,599
300

256
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:57,440
400

257
00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:01,000
500

258
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:02,600
600 700

259
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:06,958
800

260
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:09,399
900 1,000 and 1100 that's a lot of

261
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:11,239
balloons from one gallon of gas you

262
00:12:09,399 --> 00:12:13,440
could also do the calculations to figure

263
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:17,480
out how many balloons worth of oxygen it

264
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:21,720
took to do that um and

265
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:24,519
so um burning that 19 pounds of gas

266
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:27,278
produces 19 pound or I'm sorry six pound

267
00:12:24,519 --> 00:12:29,839
gallon of gas yields 19 pounds of

268
00:12:27,278 --> 00:12:32,958
CO2 and wow

269
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:35,240
um uh we're burning oh I forgot to

270
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:38,638
update that last year in 2022 we only

271
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:41,600
burned 369 million so we went up last

272
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:44,079
year there was a big dip in uh the

273
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:47,120
pandemic um but we're still we are now

274
00:12:44,078 --> 00:12:49,399
burning over seven billion or producing

275
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:51,720
over seven billion pounds of carbon

276
00:12:49,399 --> 00:12:54,720
dioxide every day just from burning

277
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:57,079
gasoline which is about a quarter of us

278
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:59,720
emissions um now we'll jump ahead back

279
00:12:57,078 --> 00:13:02,719
to our graphite

280
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:05,639
um and I'll ask again is it a lot less

281
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:09,320
about the same or a lot more and I'll

282
00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:12,839
Spill the Beans again um as we take a

283
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:15,680
look at it um a gallon of gasoline is

284
00:13:12,839 --> 00:13:18,519
about 87% carbon by weight which if you

285
00:13:15,679 --> 00:13:21,919
think about that octane um you can

286
00:13:18,519 --> 00:13:23,799
maybe picture that a little bit that

287
00:13:21,919 --> 00:13:25,719
means there's more than there's about

288
00:13:23,799 --> 00:13:29,838
five and a half pounds of carbon in

289
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:33,680
every six pound gallon of gas and um

290
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:39,720
pure graphite like this is pure carbon

291
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:44,278
um and that's not enough um

292
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:47,639
so you think this is enough and I will

293
00:13:44,278 --> 00:13:52,639
say no we've actually got to

294
00:13:47,639 --> 00:13:55,519
go to this and uh this is how much

295
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:57,879
carbon is in every gallon of gasoline

296
00:13:55,519 --> 00:14:00,879
that we burn it of course doesn't look

297
00:13:57,879 --> 00:14:03,480
like this because it's in carbon dioxide

298
00:14:00,879 --> 00:14:04,838
uh which is an invisible gas but that

299
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:09,320
much carbon is coming out of your

300
00:14:04,839 --> 00:14:11,720
tailpipe for every gallon you burn and I

301
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:14,120
will confess that I meant to order a 6X

302
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:16,639
6X two inch block initially and I I

303
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:18,320
goofed on the form and ended up uh

304
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:20,839
ordering one that's a third of the

305
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:23,519
amount and that actually I think ends up

306
00:14:20,839 --> 00:14:26,320
working well pedagogically because the

307
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:28,799
real answer is just too unbelievable so

308
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:29,639
working up to it um is a step in the

309
00:14:28,799 --> 00:14:33,919
right

310
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:36,560
Direction and um I'm going to um go on

311
00:14:33,919 --> 00:14:38,559
to the next piece here of talking about

312
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:41,399
how we might take that carbon back out

313
00:14:38,559 --> 00:14:43,319
of the air um of course it's very

314
00:14:41,399 --> 00:14:44,799
important to recognize that the simplest

315
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:46,959
thing to do is not break something

316
00:14:44,799 --> 00:14:48,679
rather than break it and then fix it and

317
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:50,319
we didn't exactly break the uh

318
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:52,278
atmosphere but we changed the way it

319
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:55,320
works and now we want to figure out how

320
00:14:52,278 --> 00:14:59,159
to change it uh back to the way it was

321
00:14:55,320 --> 00:15:01,320
when I was born maybe um and uh uh take

322
00:14:59,159 --> 00:15:03,838
that carbon back out of the air and the

323
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:06,959
simplest technology for doing that is

324
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:10,480
planting stuff um wood it turns out is

325
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:12,239
about half carbon by weight so if you

326
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:14,839
want to take five and a half pounds of

327
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:17,000
carbon out of the air by growing wood

328
00:15:14,839 --> 00:15:19,199
how much wood do you need well it we'll

329
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,958
make the math easier and say that wood

330
00:15:19,198 --> 00:15:24,479
is 50% carbon which means that you need

331
00:15:21,958 --> 00:15:27,000
to grow 11 pounds of wood to sequester

332
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:29,039
each gallon of gasoline we burn and we

333
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,679
can't let that wood burn or decay

334
00:15:29,039 --> 00:15:33,719
because that'll put the carbon back into

335
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:39,078
the atmosphere and um that should make

336
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:42,440
you say wow and uh it just so happens

337
00:15:39,078 --> 00:15:47,198
that an 8 foot

338
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:50,839
2x4 um standard 8 foot 2x4 like like

339
00:15:47,198 --> 00:15:54,599
this one right here um weighs about 11

340
00:15:50,839 --> 00:15:56,880
pounds so for every gallon of gas you

341
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:59,000
need to grow this much wood if that's

342
00:15:56,879 --> 00:16:01,600
your solution for taking the carbon B

343
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:05,399
back out of the air and we're not doing

344
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:06,600
that um and we can go on from there um

345
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:13,159
there's me and my

346
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:19,159
2x4 um and that means 11 pounds time 376

347
00:16:13,159 --> 00:16:22,159
million is over four uh billion or

348
00:16:19,159 --> 00:16:24,759
four uh four billion pounds of wood

349
00:16:22,159 --> 00:16:26,719
every day uh one and a half trillion

350
00:16:24,759 --> 00:16:31,159
pounds a year and that should make you

351
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:33,319
say wow and um I'm going to stop here

352
00:16:31,159 --> 00:16:36,000
with wherever we replace a hot process

353
00:16:33,318 --> 00:16:38,838
with a cooler one we reduce emissions

354
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:41,198
and that's where I think the The Hope

355
00:16:38,839 --> 00:16:43,160
and the courage can come in is figuring

356
00:16:41,198 --> 00:16:45,639
out how we can replace fire in the

357
00:16:43,159 --> 00:16:48,360
energy system with other ways of

358
00:16:45,639 --> 00:16:50,959
achieving our goals and I'll I'll note

359
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:55,159
that uh methane which is the largest

360
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:58,159
source of energy um in the United States

361
00:16:55,159 --> 00:17:00,838
right now I believe um it's a rapidly

362
00:16:58,159 --> 00:17:04,078
things are rapid changing um but methane

363
00:17:00,839 --> 00:17:06,279
typically Burns at about 3500 degrees F

364
00:17:04,078 --> 00:17:09,399
and for most of the things we do with it

365
00:17:06,279 --> 00:17:12,279
we do not need that level of heat and

366
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:16,199
it's exciting to think about other ways

367
00:17:12,279 --> 00:17:18,078
um to do the things that we do and uh I

368
00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:20,400
will stop there I don't know how I did

369
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:24,359
on time but I'm gonna stop

370
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:27,400
there thank you Don you were pretty much

371
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:29,759
pitch perfect um we have a we have about

372
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:31,519
two or three minutes for questions

373
00:17:29,759 --> 00:17:36,119
I think that was a very good perspective

374
00:17:31,519 --> 00:17:37,639
on especially connecting to to um well

375
00:17:36,119 --> 00:17:41,319
many audiences but especially younger

376
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:44,240
audiences this problem of scale and how

377
00:17:41,319 --> 00:17:47,839
much of a vicious problem it is in our

378
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:51,279
system um and while we're waiting oh go

379
00:17:47,839 --> 00:17:54,359
ahead well I I'll just note um I think

380
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:56,918
we miss um communicating the urgency of

381
00:17:54,359 --> 00:17:59,199
climate change and awful lot of the time

382
00:17:56,919 --> 00:18:01,400
and

383
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:03,159
understanding scale helping people

384
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:05,480
understand scale I think is really

385
00:18:03,159 --> 00:18:07,200
fundamental to helping understand the

386
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:10,599
urgency of the

387
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:12,880
situation now we do have one question in

388
00:18:10,599 --> 00:18:16,000
uh the Q&amp;A um so you were mentioning

389
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:18,039
growing wood um as a way to help offset

390
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,759
it and they were wondering um other

391
00:18:18,038 --> 00:18:23,558
types of uh life in this case like

392
00:18:20,759 --> 00:18:25,879
native grasses that may support Wildlife

393
00:18:23,558 --> 00:18:27,359
um do you have perspective on on those

394
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:30,679
kind of other things that we could look

395
00:18:27,359 --> 00:18:35,199
at as well yeah I mean generally plant

396
00:18:30,679 --> 00:18:40,919
matter is about um 45 to 50% carbon um

397
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:43,919
so that um that all um sort of works

398
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:45,720
towards the same end um grasses may have

399
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:48,038
a lot of their root system underground

400
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:52,319
so some of that mass may be protected

401
00:18:48,038 --> 00:18:55,038
from Wildfire and uh um you know

402
00:18:52,319 --> 00:18:58,839
thinking about fire and

403
00:18:55,038 --> 00:19:01,240
Wildfire uh is um very important and I I

404
00:18:58,839 --> 00:19:07,439
recommend the writings of Steven Pine py

405
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:14,519
NE um who has uh is a a fire scientist

406
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:16,679
um and uh the managed managed fire of

407
00:19:14,519 --> 00:19:19,558
grasses is an important part of making

408
00:19:16,679 --> 00:19:22,080
the ecosystem work um so there's a lot

409
00:19:19,558 --> 00:19:26,440
of really rich areas where you can go

410
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:30,480
with that and um invasive grasses uh

411
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:33,558
like cheat grass in Colorado um can uh

412
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:36,360
can produce more problems with Wildfire

413
00:19:33,558 --> 00:19:38,079
than native grasses so there's a lot of

414
00:19:36,359 --> 00:19:41,359
uh interesting ways to go with that and

415
00:19:38,079 --> 00:19:43,720
I see Jennifer's got a hand up yep just

416
00:19:41,359 --> 00:19:44,599
a quick question Don can you talk about

417
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:48,038
how

418
00:19:44,599 --> 00:19:51,000
long um wood can last in the ecosystem

419
00:19:48,038 --> 00:19:52,919
in store Corbin as opposed to a grass

420
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:56,400
what is the sort of time cycle

421
00:19:52,919 --> 00:19:58,960
difference there's a great question that

422
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:02,960
I do not know the answer off the top

423
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:05,360
head but it may well be in um

424
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:09,079
our

425
00:20:05,359 --> 00:20:10,798
um uh just a moment our our grasses we

426
00:20:09,079 --> 00:20:12,480
have we have a

427
00:20:10,798 --> 00:20:18,558
a

428
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:22,679
really um Rich uh online text um called

429
00:20:18,558 --> 00:20:25,119
Earth at home and uh the grasses section

430
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:27,519
may include info on that I have not read

431
00:20:25,119 --> 00:20:29,879
every page of it I wrote some pages of

432
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:33,158
it but uh

433
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:35,200
where you go but you may find

434
00:20:33,159 --> 00:20:39,919
info

435
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:43,319
here awesome there and I'll also

436
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:45,840
put um the Earth at home uh climate page

437
00:20:43,319 --> 00:20:48,038
where you can find a lot of climate spec

438
00:20:45,839 --> 00:20:50,639
more climate specific materials and I'll

439
00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:53,640
I'll um before before the hour is up

440
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:57,840
I'll add a link to the uh uh

441
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:57,840
presentation thank you
