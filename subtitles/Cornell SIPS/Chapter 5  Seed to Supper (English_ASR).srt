1
00:00:03,890 --> 00:00:08,370
facilitator after you planned the garden

2
00:00:06,179 --> 00:00:09,570
you plant the garden and then you're

3
00:00:08,369 --> 00:00:11,638
caring for the garden to make sure the

4
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:13,650
garden is successful the last thing is

5
00:00:11,638 --> 00:00:14,248
harvest and that's the most it's a

6
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:16,710
celebration

7
00:00:14,249 --> 00:00:18,420
you're celebrating the fruits of labor

8
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:20,519
you're celebrating the harvest you're

9
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:22,890
excited but also the time of reflection

10
00:00:20,518 --> 00:00:25,079
you could think back on what went wrong

11
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:27,118
in the planning process what went wrong

12
00:00:25,079 --> 00:00:28,768
in the planting process and what we're

13
00:00:27,118 --> 00:00:30,178
wrong in your approach of caring and you

14
00:00:28,768 --> 00:00:32,250
can connect the growth of the garden

15
00:00:30,178 --> 00:00:33,179
with the growth of the community not

16
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:35,308
saying that they're gonna grow

17
00:00:33,179 --> 00:00:36,750
simultaneously together and that you

18
00:00:35,308 --> 00:00:39,000
have a perfect garden the first time in

19
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:40,738
a perfect community the actually what

20
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,058
might happen is that if you're working

21
00:00:40,738 --> 00:00:43,679
with a community that's not use the

22
00:00:42,058 --> 00:00:46,530
gardening the garden might not be as

23
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:49,409
successful but you'll be able to see how

24
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:51,840
close the community is how the fabric of

25
00:00:49,409 --> 00:00:53,608
the community has changed and that's an

26
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,500
important part of harvest because now we

27
00:00:53,609 --> 00:00:57,719
can look back and think back oh so we

28
00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:00,238
grew this vegetable we grew this

29
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:01,829
anything grow well here in our community

30
00:01:00,238 --> 00:01:03,268
or didn't grow well in this soil

31
00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:05,129
so let's rethink about something

32
00:01:03,268 --> 00:01:06,780
different to grow it's also a good time

33
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:10,079
where a facilitator can bring in

34
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:11,700
different types of vegetables so again

35
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:13,920
you don't want to go in day one with

36
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:15,420
your own mindset of what vessels need to

37
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,799
be grown in the community you really

38
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:18,600
want to preserve communities and what

39
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:20,880
they want to grow but the second time

40
00:01:18,599 --> 00:01:23,399
around in reflection you can bring up

41
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:25,228
ideas in conversation about new fruits

42
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:27,329
or vegetables for a community to try

43
00:01:25,228 --> 00:01:29,759
they might want to or might not want to

44
00:01:27,328 --> 00:01:33,319
also the community knows you more now

45
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:35,280
you came in day one it's a stranger

46
00:01:33,319 --> 00:01:38,459
somebody keep me call you an impostor

47
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,899
but then as you care for the garden as

48
00:01:38,459 --> 00:01:43,048
they see how serious you are about the

49
00:01:39,899 --> 00:01:44,968
garden in harvest because you've stuck

50
00:01:43,049 --> 00:01:46,259
out a whole season with them and they

51
00:01:44,968 --> 00:01:48,328
see that you're committed to the work

52
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:49,950
then you can so have an additional

53
00:01:48,328 --> 00:01:53,389
conversation about importance of types

54
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:53,390
of foods and things like that

55
00:01:59,189 --> 00:02:01,250
you
