1
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:11,949
plenty of gardening is probably one of

2
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:14,990
the most important parts of

3
00:00:11,949 --> 00:00:16,910
developing a garden location is

4
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:18,618
important what you want to grow is

5
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:20,390
important he brainstormed with the

6
00:00:18,618 --> 00:00:22,070
community what do you want to grow how

7
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:24,768
do you want to grow what foods do you

8
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:26,899
want it fosters a culture of learning at

9
00:00:24,768 --> 00:00:28,759
all levels everyone doesn't learn the

10
00:00:26,899 --> 00:00:30,979
same way so we have to honor that

11
00:00:28,759 --> 00:00:33,109
respect that and going into a community

12
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:35,270
and playing the garden around those

13
00:00:33,109 --> 00:00:37,760
principles and understanding and you're

14
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:40,100
using physical soil but you also have

15
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:43,218
this community soil that also has to be

16
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:46,058
taken care of and continuously created

17
00:00:43,219 --> 00:00:46,058
and recreated I

18
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,870
think the most important part of the

19
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:52,308
garden is ensuring that the food is what

20
00:00:50,869 --> 00:00:54,349
the community needs and the food is what

21
00:00:52,308 --> 00:00:57,049
they want and then it's our job to make

22
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:59,179
sure that we provide like a design or

23
00:00:57,049 --> 00:01:00,229
help them design it or exposing the

24
00:00:59,179 --> 00:01:01,969
different designs with them choose what

25
00:01:00,229 --> 00:01:03,709
design because the garden has to be well

26
00:01:01,969 --> 00:01:06,049
designed to make sure we get the most

27
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:07,790
food out of it so this is also something

28
00:01:06,049 --> 00:01:09,439
important to see the organization of a

29
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:11,180
community garden because this is

30
00:01:09,438 --> 00:01:13,368
something that a facilitator would help

31
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:15,530
a community develop as in they would

32
00:01:13,368 --> 00:01:17,810
help the community figure out how they

33
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:20,540
want something plots who wants to plant

34
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:22,040
word plant where actually sit down with

35
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:23,960
the community develop their own rules

36
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:25,460
and regulations although also if you're

37
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:26,959
in a city or in a certain County or a

38
00:01:25,459 --> 00:01:29,269
town or community that already

39
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:30,978
regulations around land use so but still

40
00:01:29,269 --> 00:01:32,658
trailer can help a community understand

41
00:01:30,978 --> 00:01:34,819
the rules and regulations around land

42
00:01:32,659 --> 00:01:36,200
use then also help them decide on how

43
00:01:34,819 --> 00:01:37,908
they want to plan their garden and

44
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:40,009
organize these habits again this is a

45
00:01:37,909 --> 00:01:42,170
like a facilitation method as in your

46
00:01:40,009 --> 00:01:44,030
facilitating I'm a process between the

47
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:45,799
community and also the county in the

48
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:47,599
city in which it lives in and also the

49
00:01:45,799 --> 00:01:49,689
structure and design of its ultimate

50
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:52,250
garden

51
00:01:49,688 --> 00:01:54,978
so if you already have a site available

52
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:56,450
you use that site and you grow on that

53
00:01:54,978 --> 00:01:57,769
site but if you're going into a

54
00:01:56,450 --> 00:02:00,259
community where they want to brainstorm

55
00:01:57,769 --> 00:02:01,908
sites visibility is very important

56
00:02:00,259 --> 00:02:04,430
because you want to attract diverse

57
00:02:01,909 --> 00:02:05,719
people diverse communities and you want

58
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:07,520
to create again you're creating a space

59
00:02:05,718 --> 00:02:10,969
for people to learn from each other as

60
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:12,319
well so ability is very important but do

61
00:02:10,969 --> 00:02:14,330
you want to go behind the tractor you

62
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:15,949
think about accessibility and if a

63
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:17,750
community accesses a certain space

64
00:02:15,949 --> 00:02:19,909
easier than other spaces you want to

65
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:21,770
choose an easier space to access cuz

66
00:02:19,909 --> 00:02:23,599
food access is not only just about

67
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:26,980
social access but it's also about

68
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:26,979
physical access as well

69
00:02:32,789 --> 00:02:34,848
you
