University hi welcome to the Cornell

3
00:00:10,839 --> 00:00:16,960
Turfgrass video log we're here at the

4
00:00:12,919 --> 00:00:18,240
Beth Page State Park in early June and

5
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,719
one of the things we're starting to

6
00:00:18,239 --> 00:00:22,118
notice on the greens and I think we're

7
00:00:19,719 --> 00:00:23,719
noticing this all over Northern climates

8
00:00:22,118 --> 00:00:26,118
is we've come through some heat and then

9
00:00:23,719 --> 00:00:28,759
some cool weather the spring growth

10
00:00:26,118 --> 00:00:30,960
surge is just about behind us now and

11
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:32,840
it's about time that the the two grass

12
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,039
systems we manage on putting green start

13
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:37,760
to react a little differently you'll

14
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:39,280
notice we've got uh a much more in

15
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:41,558
starting to get an increase in Bank

16
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,719
Grass as the heat is coming on and it's

17
00:00:41,558 --> 00:00:45,759
starting to get a little bit leggy so

18
00:00:43,719 --> 00:00:48,160
that may need some additional cultural

19
00:00:45,759 --> 00:00:50,238
practices top dressing vertical mowing

20
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:51,558
but you've got to be really careful

21
00:00:50,238 --> 00:00:53,718
because if you start to do that

22
00:00:51,558 --> 00:00:55,878
aggressively the annual Blue Grass which

23
00:00:53,719 --> 00:00:57,480
will not like the heat will not take it

24
00:00:55,878 --> 00:00:59,679
as well and you could set yourself up

25
00:00:57,479 --> 00:01:02,000
for additional problems especially as

26
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:05,879
we're approaching the summer equinox and

27
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,959
we get to that climatological maximum ET

28
00:01:05,879 --> 00:01:10,239
where Sun's highest in the sky and we're

29
00:01:07,959 --> 00:01:12,199
losing about a 10 2/10 of an inch of

30
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:15,000
water a day we'll have to really keep

31
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:17,320
track of our stressful practices while

32
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,599
the bent grass might need it the annual

33
00:01:17,319 --> 00:01:21,798
Bluegrass might suffer from some damage

34
00:01:19,599 --> 00:01:24,438
if you try to be too aggressive so try

35
00:01:21,799 --> 00:01:26,280
to find that sweet spot and getting that

36
00:01:24,438 --> 00:01:28,199
bent grass managed to provide a good

37
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:30,000
putting surface without adding

38
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,640
additional problems to the annual Blu

39
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,118
grass this is Frank Rossy for the
