1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:04,280
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:13,440
University um so I've kind of called

3
00:00:10,839 --> 00:00:15,359
this talk finding a passion for patunas

4
00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:18,559
um I think patunas are sometimes they're

5
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:20,278
one of those um they're ubiquitous

6
00:00:18,559 --> 00:00:22,719
they're really popular in garden centers

7
00:00:20,278 --> 00:00:25,640
in springtime um they're also a very

8
00:00:22,719 --> 00:00:27,479
easy plant for people to hate right uh

9
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:28,679
they're sticky they've got lots of

10
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:32,159
different colors to them but they're

11
00:00:28,678 --> 00:00:35,479
kind of plant nerd they're kind of basic

12
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:36,640
right if you think about it okay umh and

13
00:00:35,479 --> 00:00:37,878
so we'll kind of get into that but I

14
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:39,840
wanted to kind of share like what are we

15

everybody um we'll talk first about some

21
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:55,359
origin stories um why I feel so

22
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:58,280
passionately about lettuce and then why

23
00:00:55,359 --> 00:01:00,120
I found a passion for patunas um we'll

24
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:02,280
do some overview and talking about the

25
00:01:00,119 --> 00:01:04,798
horiculture industry as a whole from the

26
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:07,359
ornamentals side of horiculture and what

27
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:09,040
it looks like today um who is doom and

28
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:11,680
orange what is the company what are we

29
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:13,640
doing um and then also kind of dive into

30
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,280
some new technologies that are happening

31
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:17,799
within the Horticulture industry and are

32
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:19,519
really super exciting um and then last

33
00:01:17,799 --> 00:01:21,040
but not least I'll kind of share some

34
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:23,280
ways that you can kind of Choose Your

35
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:25,719
Own Adventure um or grow your own

36
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,320
adventure as I like to say um and

37
00:01:25,719 --> 00:01:30,560
talking about that there are future

38
00:01:27,319 --> 00:01:32,478
career paths in horiculture or um

39
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:36,200
outside of just growing in a greenhouse

40
00:01:32,478 --> 00:01:38,920
or gr for a Botanical Garden um and I'm

41

49
00:01:52,078 --> 00:02:01,399
be a fun time so um how did it all start

50
00:01:57,359 --> 00:02:04,879
um this is me in a nutshell I am not

51
00:02:01,399 --> 00:02:06,879
from a plant family um I don't come from

52
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:08,679
a grower family a background in

53
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:10,878
horiculture I come from two parents who

54
00:02:08,679 --> 00:02:13,239
are artists um one who grew up in

55
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:15,878
Manhattan the other one who grew up uh

56
00:02:13,239 --> 00:02:19,519
living afternoons and weekends at the

57
00:02:15,878 --> 00:02:22,719
Cleveland Institute of Art uh and from

58
00:02:19,519 --> 00:02:24,959
my dad dad's side of the family uh from

59
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:26,359
a farm in uh Southern Vermont Southern

60
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:29,439
New Hampshire where they grow

61
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:32,720
organically grown beef cattle um that is

62
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:36,159
where I first found my passion for uh

63
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:40,000
the Earth and stewardship of just the

64
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:42,560
land in general um my parents were also

65
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,800
kind of uh hipsters in the sense they're

66
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:47,239
kind of outward thinking people uh

67
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:51,680
growing vegetables in 1980s out in the

68
00:02:47,239 --> 00:02:54,560
front yard W nelli crazy concept okay

69
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:57,760
it's watermelon and lettuce right um I'm

70
00:02:54,560 --> 00:03:02,158
also that kid who at five uh actually no

71
00:02:57,759 --> 00:03:04,759
at six um I recognized living in dit or

72
00:03:02,158 --> 00:03:06,479
just a suburb of Syracuse I didn't like

73
00:03:04,759 --> 00:03:09,719
the fact that when I'd go on walks

74
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:11,878
around anad Daga Lake uh it was polluted

75
00:03:09,719 --> 00:03:14,400
and I'd see people's trash and so I made

76
00:03:11,878 --> 00:03:15,679
my own Earth Day campaign in the 90s of

77
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,239
please don't throw your trash because

78
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:20,480
that's not really nice into the lake um

79
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:23,840
but it really started at the age of 10

80
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:26,399
this is me later on at age of 18 uh I

81
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,959
went to Disney World for the first time

82
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,360
and for those of you who have been there

83
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:32,840
or may not have been there uh cot is one

84
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:34,319
of the parks in Florida and they have a

85
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:37,438
pavilion or a space that's called living

86
00:03:34,318 --> 00:03:39,839
with the land and they have a ride there

87
00:03:37,438 --> 00:03:42,000
uh where you get into a boat and you

88
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:44,719
learn about horiculture and you learn

89
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,519
about aquaculture and hydroponics and in

90
00:03:44,719 --> 00:03:48,878
the late 90s early

91
00:03:46,519 --> 00:03:50,319
2000s that I turned to my mother and I

92
00:03:48,878 --> 00:03:52,759
said this is what I want to do with the

93
00:03:50,318 --> 00:03:55,119
rest of my life I found a passion for

94
00:03:52,759 --> 00:03:57,798
Hydroponics a passion for lettuce and

95
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:59,799
that is how I came to uh Cornell I

96
00:03:57,799 --> 00:04:02,120
wanted to originally work for either

97
00:03:59,799 --> 00:04:04,360
Seed Company uh for

98
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:07,680
Monsanto and then learned very swiftly

99
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:11,599
Monsanto is not a great place to work at

100
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:13,360
and uh I ended up here um but in those

101
00:04:11,598 --> 00:04:17,319
early days I kind of thought that

102
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:20,479
horiculture was really just gardening

103
00:04:17,319 --> 00:04:22,439
right and what does gardening entail

104
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:25,079
right well gardening in my mind in the

105
00:04:22,439 --> 00:04:26,879
early 2000s is the 18-year-old you have

106
00:04:25,079 --> 00:04:28,800
a grower you have somebody who's making

107
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:31,079
those plants that you ultimately will go

108
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:33,199
to either an independent Garden Center

109
00:04:31,079 --> 00:04:35,159
or you'll go to Home Depot or Lowe's and

110
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:38,000
you'll buy those plants and then you'll

111
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:40,039
bring them home and that to me was my my

112
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:44,319
scope of what horiculture really could

113
00:04:40,038 --> 00:04:46,599
be um but Cornell opened my eyes to that

114
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:49,199
um so I was at Cornell in the early

115
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:50,960
2000s to give you perspective half a lot

116
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:54,038
of the buildings that are here now

117
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:56,719
didn't even exist right um Hunter

118
00:04:54,038 --> 00:04:59,079
Rawlings Roan he was a great president

119
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:01,680
he was our president at the time uh

120
00:04:59,079 --> 00:05:04,680
men's hock was in the Frozen 4 twice

121
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:06,879
woohoo go line of faithful um court and

122
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:08,400
Muse were two brand new residence Halls

123
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:10,319
that opened for the second time I think

124
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:14,120
they've now been renamed to Ruth Bader

125
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:16,959
Ginsburg and another person um but North

126
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:20,840
Campus was for freshman only um and we

127
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:24,478
had things like Facebook iPhones

128
00:05:20,839 --> 00:05:28,239
Snapchat Instagram none of those things

129
00:05:24,478 --> 00:05:31,279
existed okay so we're kind of the analog

130
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:33,519
and back when actually Kanye West was a

131
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:35,159
good person and Snoop Dog was still

132
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:37,719
really a good person they both performed

133
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:41,520
at Slope Day so but beyond having lots

134
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:43,720
of fun uh we did a lot of um great

135
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:47,599
science things here as well too um I was

136
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:49,360
an intern uh with bills group at the uh

137
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,840
Bluegrass Lane the horiculture test

138
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:53,840
Gardens there uh where we had different

139
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:56,119
breeders would send us their trial

140
00:05:53,839 --> 00:06:00,439
plants or trial material and that was

141
00:05:56,120 --> 00:06:03,399
kind of my first I guess like foot into

142
00:06:00,439 --> 00:06:05,240
what theic horiculture industry could be

143
00:06:03,399 --> 00:06:07,239
it opened my eyes to that there are more

144
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:10,120
plants than just patunas or geraniums

145
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:13,639
that exist and there are breeders there

146
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:16,079
are companies that actually make new

147
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:20,000
plants and that they use help from

148
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:22,038
universities and from interns like us to

149
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,720
uh evaluate those plants to see how well

150
00:06:22,038 --> 00:06:25,959
they do in our landscape how well do

151
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:28,000
they do in our environmental conditions

152
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:29,918
it was on trips to going to say Lucas

153
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,879
green houses in New Jersey the open my

154
00:06:29,918 --> 00:06:35,439
eyes further into what is it like to own

155
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:37,918
and to work and to operate at a very

156
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:40,800
large scale uh production

157
00:06:37,918 --> 00:06:42,198
Greenhouse um also some sciency things

158
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:46,000
some of my favorite pictures of soil

159
00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:48,800
science lab as well as uh my time as a

160
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:52,720
weed scientist uh identifying weeds in

161
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:54,079
weed trials so through Cornell my whole

162
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,360
vision of the horiculture industry kind

163
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:59,279
of broadened right so now we have

164
00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:00,598
additional Fields here we have a breeder

165
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:02,719
there's somebody who's actually creating

166
00:07:00,598 --> 00:07:04,918
those plants we now are calling the hom

167
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:07,039
Gardener actually consumers and I got

168
00:07:04,918 --> 00:07:08,560
super jazzed by things like the cely

169
00:07:07,038 --> 00:07:10,800
conference where we would bring people

170
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:12,800
from the industry to come and talk to us

171
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:15,000
about what's happening in the market

172
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,439
right now what are different Trends what

173
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,800
are some pain points for the whole

174
00:07:16,439 --> 00:07:21,160
entire industry as a whole how do we get

175
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:23,120
more people to buy more plants and to

176
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:25,800
live a life with plants and I really

177
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:27,519
found that that was where my passion was

178
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:29,280
I didn't want to work for a chemical

179
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:31,839
company didn't want to be Shilling my

180
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:34,439
life working for Academia sorry

181
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:36,198
guys um but I wanted to somehow get more

182
00:07:34,439 --> 00:07:38,038
plants into the hands of people and to

183
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:39,840
make the world a more beautiful place

184
00:07:38,038 --> 00:07:42,560
and universities and extension obviously

185
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:44,839
was another part of that whole arm and

186
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:48,120
it was through visits

187
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:50,758
to this really great trade show uh

188
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:53,120
called the Ohio short course at the time

189
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:56,000
it's now uh operated it's called

190
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:59,000
cultivate uh at American Hort uh the in

191
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,319
the industry or um Association for

192
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,120
horiculture

193
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:04,280
where I got a complete immersion into

194
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,840
all the different fields that you could

195
00:08:04,279 --> 00:08:09,439
really have here in horiculture it's

196
00:08:05,839 --> 00:08:10,878
beyond just those iOS that we had before

197
00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:12,680
but we have things like automation we

198
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:14,319
have Engineers that are involved in this

199
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:17,038
we have marketing companies that make

200
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:20,400
tags and HS all that kind of information

201
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:23,719
so truly the horiculture industry is

202
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:25,959
made up of a whole bunch of different um

203
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:27,400
aspects we have research and development

204
00:08:25,959 --> 00:08:29,038
we have those propagation Farms that

205
00:08:27,399 --> 00:08:30,679
actually bring the plants to life and

206
00:08:29,038 --> 00:08:32,838
bring them to the garden centers or to

207
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:34,879
The Growers that are growing them we

208
00:08:32,839 --> 00:08:37,320
have fields of marketing we have fields

209
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:39,278
of brokerage sales the concept that how

210
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:41,200
do these plants actually get to Market

211
00:08:39,278 --> 00:08:42,918
how are we selling them across uh the

212
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:46,080
United States as well as into

213
00:08:42,918 --> 00:08:48,600
Europe engineering and automation it is

214
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,800
really incredibly important University

215
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:52,639
and extension is also still a really

216
00:08:50,799 --> 00:08:54,958
integral role to the success of the

217
00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:54,958
entire

218
00:08:55,278 --> 00:09:00,838
industry so after Cornell I was

219
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,079
recruited out and I worked for a company

220
00:09:00,839 --> 00:09:05,480
called Peace Tree Farm where they were a

221
00:09:03,078 --> 00:09:08,679
small grower uh just outside of the

222
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:10,839
north of Philadelphia uh all organic

223
00:09:08,679 --> 00:09:13,399
production and there I was their sales

224
00:09:10,839 --> 00:09:15,560
and marketing director I also had a kid

225
00:09:13,399 --> 00:09:18,600
at that time and was able to bring my 7

226
00:09:15,559 --> 00:09:20,599
week old daughter to the greenhouse and

227
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:23,720
she grew up living a life with plants

228
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:25,360
she is now 10 uh and probably knows and

229
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:27,079
can identify lavender better than

230
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:29,560
anybody else in the

231
00:09:27,078 --> 00:09:31,278
industry um and at that time so what

232
00:09:29,559 --> 00:09:33,599
does sales and marketing director really

233
00:09:31,278 --> 00:09:37,600
mean or manager really mean I was kind

234
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:40,600
of a Jill of all trades um I was writing

235
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:42,200
invoices I was booking sales I was

236
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:45,480
partnering with botanical gardens

237
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:47,360
because we were plant Geeks at heart um

238
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:49,240
I was doing a lot of broker relations so

239
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,879
working with the different sales

240
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:53,560
companies to kind of get our products

241
00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:55,078
out into the marketplace to get them to

242
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:57,719
the different Growers so that we could

243
00:09:55,078 --> 00:10:01,078
buy and sell more plants um and through

244
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:03,759
that time I also was a part of uh the

245
00:10:01,078 --> 00:10:05,479
launch and product launch and patenting

246
00:10:03,759 --> 00:10:07,958
of a plant called lavender phenomenal

247
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:10,480
who's ever heard of lavender

248
00:10:07,958 --> 00:10:12,278
phenomenal awesome that's good that's

249
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,200
more than I thought more than just bill

250
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:16,958
andil that's great uh lavender

251
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:20,200
phenomenal it's a um we found it it was

252
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:23,359
a sport of lavender that we were

253
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:25,879
propagating uh and it is one of the top

254
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:29,320
selling now cultivars of lavender on the

255
00:10:25,879 --> 00:10:31,919
market it has surpassed Gro munstead and

256
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:34,800
hi coat uh it is far superior in its

257
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:37,199
Garden performance um and it was really

258
00:10:34,799 --> 00:10:39,159
phenomenal uh from its uniform

259
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,680
architecture from plant to plant to

260
00:10:39,159 --> 00:10:42,719
plant to plant I used to say it was like

261
00:10:40,679 --> 00:10:45,439
little soldiers all in a row uh when you

262
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:48,079
were planting it out at lavender Farms

263
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:50,160
it was pretty great it was a wild time

264
00:10:48,078 --> 00:10:52,479
um after that I decided I needed to come

265
00:10:50,159 --> 00:10:54,759
back home to Central New York uh so I

266
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,200
worked at Dickman Farms Garden Center

267
00:10:54,759 --> 00:10:58,319
they are an independent Garden Center

268
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:59,759
just north of here in Auburn New York

269
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,200
they're also

270
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:03,319
wholesale Growers one of the biggest

271
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:07,560
wholesale Growers here in the in New

272
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:10,278
York state and I ran the retail arm of

273
00:11:07,559 --> 00:11:14,278
that company for five years um we

274
00:11:10,278 --> 00:11:16,439
brought up the profits of the company uh

275
00:11:14,278 --> 00:11:18,720
from 2% to 8% which is pretty great

276
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:20,519
through skew rationalization really

277
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:23,120
trying to hyperfocus what our products

278
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:26,639
we were offering to our our customers

279
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:29,078
and then Co hit and that was a wild ride

280
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:30,759
and crazy time and as much as I loved

281
00:11:29,078 --> 00:11:33,199
being being able to get plants into the

282
00:11:30,759 --> 00:11:37,759
hands of people and through that by

283
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:40,160
retail I hated babysitting I schoolers

284
00:11:37,759 --> 00:11:43,639
babysitting adults we all know that New

285
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:46,278
York was pretty uh high on the list of

286
00:11:43,639 --> 00:11:48,278
um different things that we had to um

287
00:11:46,278 --> 00:11:50,958
you know make sure what our staff

288
00:11:48,278 --> 00:11:57,120
members were doing during cult uh during

289
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:59,278
covid um and I yeah it was a lot um

290
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:02,679
still the craziest time ever and I love

291
00:11:59,278 --> 00:12:06,120
love it but I was ready to get back to

292
00:12:02,679 --> 00:12:09,078
what I loved at P tree which was things

293
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:11,519
like um deciding what type of products

294
00:12:09,078 --> 00:12:14,120
we would be offering to a company um

295
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:15,720
deciding how do we tell the story of a

296
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:18,440
particular plant how do we bring that

297
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:21,278
plant to Market how do we get people

298
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:24,560
excited and kind of that storytelling of

299
00:12:21,278 --> 00:12:26,039
different plants and so I always knew at

300
00:12:24,559 --> 00:12:27,958
some point that I might end up working

301
00:12:26,039 --> 00:12:29,679
for a company whether it be ball

302
00:12:27,958 --> 00:12:34,319
horiculture

303
00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:38,039
selecta or uh senta and I ended up at

304
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:39,920
Duman orange where we make a living of

305
00:12:38,039 --> 00:12:42,278
making uh plants a beautiful place and

306
00:12:39,919 --> 00:12:44,838
the world a beautiful place so who is

307
00:12:42,278 --> 00:12:48,519
doom and orange doom and orange is the

308
00:12:44,839 --> 00:12:51,040
largest breeding company in the world

309
00:12:48,519 --> 00:12:54,720
and we got to that way because um we

310
00:12:51,039 --> 00:12:57,120
started in 2000 here in North America uh

311
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:59,800
and we've over time have uh through a

312
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:02,159
whole bunch of Acquisitions and mergers

313
00:12:59,799 --> 00:13:06,240
and uh bringing together of different

314
00:13:02,159 --> 00:13:08,039
companies we now are the largest um I

315
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:10,879
guess breeding company or holder of

316
00:13:08,039 --> 00:13:14,360
different plants uh in the in the world

317
00:13:10,879 --> 00:13:18,039
we have 53,000 employees we operate in

318
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:20,680
18 different countries we have a huge

319
00:13:18,039 --> 00:13:23,000
scope of uh what we are offering and

320
00:13:20,679 --> 00:13:25,198
what we're doing um but really what our

321
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,240
focus is is not only growing a better

322
00:13:25,198 --> 00:13:31,120
place but also making the world a more

323
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:31,120
sustainable place as well

324
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:36,959
okay now where does Doom and orange kind

325
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:39,560
of operate and this is kind of getting

326
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:41,599
back towards like that initial kind of

327
00:13:39,559 --> 00:13:43,879
half fan that I started out in the

328
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,920
beginning of the seminar uh but doom and

329
00:13:43,879 --> 00:13:47,399
orange focus is here okay so we're a

330
00:13:45,919 --> 00:13:49,000
breeding company we have a number of

331
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:51,879
breeders that work for us and we focus

332
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:54,519
on creating new plants creating better

333
00:13:51,879 --> 00:13:55,838
plants that are more sustainable better

334
00:13:54,519 --> 00:13:57,959
for the environment better for our

335
00:13:55,839 --> 00:14:01,040
Growers we also own a number of

336
00:13:57,958 --> 00:14:03,559
propagation Farms so taking those uh

337
00:14:01,039 --> 00:14:05,360
plants that we've bred building them out

338
00:14:03,559 --> 00:14:07,518
at a farm and then shipping them to

339
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:10,959
Growers here in the United States or

340
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:13,839
Canada or globally and then we also own

341
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:16,359
a brokerage firm uh and similarly say to

342
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:18,360
ball Flora plant they also own a

343
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:20,159
brokerage firm so a brokerage firm is

344
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:22,240
basically a group of salespeople that

345
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:24,198
help make that connection between the

346
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:27,360
breeder to the

347
00:14:24,198 --> 00:14:28,719
grower and then we that all then relies

348
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,440
then on the grower to the retailer to

349
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:34,759
the cons conser and a product manager

350
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:36,800
what I do lies within this entire part

351
00:14:34,759 --> 00:14:40,159
of the scale we kind of stop when it

352
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:44,078
gets to the retailer I'm the glue

353
00:14:40,159 --> 00:14:45,600
essentially between the breeder and then

354
00:14:44,078 --> 00:14:48,399
making sure that that plank comes to

355
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:51,000
Market I have a uh a team of breeders

356
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:52,799
that I work with um and every year they

357
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,720
will come together we'll go through a

358
00:14:52,799 --> 00:14:57,000
number of different breeder trials and

359
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:58,440
we'll say how you know what plants do we

360
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,039
want to move forward with that kind of

361
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:02,720
thing so I like to call product

362
00:15:00,039 --> 00:15:04,879
management is the Art and Science of

363
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:06,040
horticulture you get to have the sciency

364
00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:09,198
side you get to do a lot of different

365
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:11,439
trials research both confidential trials

366
00:15:09,198 --> 00:15:14,078
at grower level or in within breeder

367
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:17,000
trials across the globe you have to deal

368
00:15:14,078 --> 00:15:19,039
with sales forecast and Analysis is it

369
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,240
time for a variety to be retired because

370
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:22,639
it sales have been decreasing or do I

371
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:24,680
really truly believe in this really

372
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:27,079
amazing plant that is super awesome for

373
00:15:24,679 --> 00:15:28,719
XYZ reason and how can we grow the

374
00:15:27,078 --> 00:15:30,758
business that way talking about

375
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:33,079
different business plan development or

376
00:15:30,759 --> 00:15:35,480
product launches and also management of

377
00:15:33,078 --> 00:15:38,719
a portfolio so like Bill was saying I

378
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:42,319
manage half of the annuals portfolio for

379
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:44,360
Doom and orange uh globally um I work

380
00:15:42,318 --> 00:15:47,519
with specifically with pinia verbina

381
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:49,879
caliber COA I will also work with all of

382
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:52,440
their different mixes that we design so

383
00:15:49,879 --> 00:15:56,480
that's where I get to be a little more

384
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:59,040
artsy and I get to have an hand in

385
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:00,680
marketing I get to have a hand in how

386
00:15:59,039 --> 00:16:02,439
some different retail exclusives that we

387
00:16:00,679 --> 00:16:05,958
want to offer either to be Home Depot or

388
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:08,160
to box stores or to Independent chains I

389
00:16:05,958 --> 00:16:09,958
work with invent planning and execution

390
00:16:08,159 --> 00:16:13,198
so we have state California spring

391
00:16:09,958 --> 00:16:14,518
trials or our displays that cultivate um

392
00:16:13,198 --> 00:16:16,519
one of my favorite Parts is also

393
00:16:14,519 --> 00:16:18,759
teaching and presenting and telling that

394
00:16:16,519 --> 00:16:20,639
plant's story so we'll work with our

395
00:16:18,759 --> 00:16:22,519
broker teams and telling them about why

396
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:24,799
is this plant so amazing why do we come

397
00:16:22,519 --> 00:16:27,000
out and launch this new variety how is

398
00:16:24,799 --> 00:16:29,120
it different from the competition why is

399
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,679
it going to be a success for Growers for

400
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:33,720
the end consumer so I like to call that

401
00:16:31,679 --> 00:16:37,879
plant

402
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:40,240
storytelling so Duman is turning 25 this

403
00:16:37,879 --> 00:16:42,399
year which is kind of crazy uh to think

404
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:44,680
about so if you've been in the industry

405
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:46,799
for quite some time and working you

406
00:16:44,679 --> 00:16:48,919
might have uh started to recognize some

407
00:16:46,799 --> 00:16:51,439
of our Brands um I can't believe I

408
00:16:48,919 --> 00:16:55,360
didn't put confetti Garden on here

409
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:57,440
confetti Garden is uh a brand of mixed

410
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:59,759
combinations so hanging baskets or

411
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:01,560
planters that you would find at a Center

412
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:05,519
there is a brainchild there's someone

413
00:17:01,559 --> 00:17:08,279
who has created that design um uh on its

414
00:17:05,519 --> 00:17:10,918
own and dumen came up with the concept

415
00:17:08,279 --> 00:17:13,279
of being able to plant three plants

416
00:17:10,919 --> 00:17:16,000
together so a petunia a verbina a calbra

417
00:17:13,279 --> 00:17:18,480
COA all into one plug that a grower

418
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:22,519
would then root together and then sell

419
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:25,798
or transplant on its own um P tunia plus

420
00:17:22,519 --> 00:17:27,318
was a brand new concept as well uh that

421
00:17:25,798 --> 00:17:30,000
a petunia that could actually be in a

422
00:17:27,318 --> 00:17:32,000
small size that you could uh grow in a

423
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,880
qut size pot which probably to many of

424
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,679
us seems like well yeah duh that's

425
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:39,480
always the size that I get a pinia in

426
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:41,320
right nowadays um Magnum in patience was

427
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:43,440
a brand we were the first to Market with

428
00:17:41,319 --> 00:17:45,599
an oversized 2in siiz new guine

429
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:47,558
impatient which was unheard of at the

430
00:17:45,599 --> 00:17:49,599
time um and a lot of other product

431
00:17:47,558 --> 00:17:53,918
launches that we've had along the

432
00:17:49,599 --> 00:17:56,959
way but even with all of this kind of

433
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:59,559
great fun it's not always the better

434
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:01,480
roses there's a lot of of different

435
00:17:59,558 --> 00:18:03,678
stresses that are happening in our

436
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:05,200
environment right now whether it be

437
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:07,320
environmental stresses whether it be

438
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:11,400
Market stresses whether it be weather

439
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:13,480
climate change um the fact that uh you

440
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:15,720
know we have limited dollars as

441
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:18,919
consumers to spend on are we going to

442
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:20,919
spend it on a luxury like plants or are

443
00:18:18,919 --> 00:18:22,240
we going to spend it on an essential

444
00:18:20,919 --> 00:18:25,520
thing like

445
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:26,720
plants um so I don't know I'm going to

446
00:18:25,519 --> 00:18:28,079
pose the question out to the group what

447
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:30,279
are some different stresses that we

448
00:18:28,079 --> 00:18:32,038
think might be influencing the

449
00:18:30,279 --> 00:18:34,918
horiculture market right now we talked

450
00:18:32,038 --> 00:18:38,879
about climate change we talked about you

451
00:18:34,919 --> 00:18:41,640
know indis or you know limited income

452
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:46,280
that we could play with other things go

453
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:49,720
ahead chain isues yeah my biggest pain

454
00:18:46,279 --> 00:18:52,399
point in my side supply chain issues uh

455
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:54,839
not only is that a pain safe for uh the

456
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:57,038
plants themselves we can sometimes have

457
00:18:54,839 --> 00:19:00,000
issues where we either had a snafu at

458
00:18:57,038 --> 00:19:03,158
our propagation Farm or there's weather

459
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:06,200
that plays a role or there are you know

460
00:19:03,159 --> 00:19:08,679
Hang-Ups at the border um even supply

461
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:10,519
chain issues that we saw during covid we

462
00:19:08,679 --> 00:19:13,960
are now seeing a Resurgence of that

463
00:19:10,519 --> 00:19:16,679
again now with the uh Dock and Port

464
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:19,240
closures uh uh so there are going to be

465
00:19:16,679 --> 00:19:21,559
issues with plastics availability and

466
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:26,359
soil availability uh that was a great

467
00:19:21,558 --> 00:19:26,359
one yeah other pain points think

468
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:32,440
about maybe a disease

469
00:19:30,279 --> 00:19:36,678
yeah disease and insect so bacteria

470
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:39,279
fungi viroids especially um those are

471
00:19:36,679 --> 00:19:42,240
some of the biggest biggest problems

472
00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:45,519
that we think about because we have to

473
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:48,200
also um the amount of inputs that we put

474
00:19:45,519 --> 00:19:50,359
to prevent either insects or diseases

475
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:52,798
whether it be an IPM Focus or whether it

476
00:19:50,359 --> 00:19:54,719
be a chemical focus it still is an input

477
00:19:52,798 --> 00:19:55,599
that goes into the final production of

478
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:57,960
that

479
00:19:55,599 --> 00:19:59,480
plant I wrote down a short list myself

480
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:00,519
let me remember

481
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:03,240
cost of

482
00:20:00,519 --> 00:20:06,038
Labor also a huge pain Point especially

483
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:08,120
here in New York state um it continues

484
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:10,599
to go up which I think is great you know

485
00:20:08,119 --> 00:20:13,719
it's really good to be able to help our

486
00:20:10,599 --> 00:20:16,399
employees you know have a decent uh you

487
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:19,120
know cost of living but it is a huge

488
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:21,519
stress on the business owner uh how can

489
00:20:19,119 --> 00:20:24,079
we still own and operate an independent

490
00:20:21,519 --> 00:20:26,798
Garden Center or own and operate a small

491
00:20:24,079 --> 00:20:28,399
mom and pop say grower and still be able

492
00:20:26,798 --> 00:20:31,798
to feed and put food on the tables of

493
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:34,159
the people people who work for us so

494
00:20:31,798 --> 00:20:36,798
that's what breeders are constantly

495
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:38,440
looking at is trying to solve those

496
00:20:36,798 --> 00:20:41,480
problems what are those problems that we

497
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:44,960
can identify as a breeding company how

498
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:47,120
can we sometimes uh fix those problems

499
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:50,480
so in other in other words in order to

500
00:20:47,119 --> 00:20:52,399
stay relevant right in this everchanging

501
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,919
environment there's pressures and

502
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:55,919
influences coming from all different

503
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:57,720
directions you have to constantly

504
00:20:55,919 --> 00:21:00,559
innovate and that is what doom and

505
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:02,279
orange has always done

506
00:21:00,558 --> 00:21:04,480
so we were the first to come to Market

507
00:21:02,279 --> 00:21:06,678
with uh Marvin you talked about it this

508
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:08,599
morning with daylength neutrality in

509
00:21:06,679 --> 00:21:10,960
strawberries we were the first breeder

510
00:21:08,599 --> 00:21:13,759
to come with day link neutrality in

511
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:16,120
patunas so from strawberries and from

512
00:21:13,759 --> 00:21:19,000
fruit production we take a lot of kind

513
00:21:16,119 --> 00:21:20,599
of insights from regular Agriculture and

514
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,599
apply that to horiculture which is

515
00:21:20,599 --> 00:21:24,839
pretty great um we also were the first

516
00:21:22,599 --> 00:21:29,278
to come to Market with a concept called

517
00:21:24,839 --> 00:21:32,519
baswell um in the early 2010s

518
00:21:29,278 --> 00:21:35,960
uh in Holland and in Germany there was a

519
00:21:32,519 --> 00:21:38,480
technology where um in order to decrease

520
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:42,038
the number of people at a greenhouse and

521
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:44,360
to speed up production of young plants

522
00:21:42,038 --> 00:21:47,558
they developed a machine that would pick

523
00:21:44,359 --> 00:21:50,519
up eight line eight pieces of an

524
00:21:47,558 --> 00:21:53,119
unrooted cutting at a time and go jinka

525
00:21:50,519 --> 00:21:56,240
g jinka it would pick up those

526
00:21:53,119 --> 00:21:58,119
those um cuting with their hands and

527
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:01,359
then it would plant them automatically

528
00:21:58,119 --> 00:22:03,479
into a full row or a full tray um of

529
00:22:01,359 --> 00:22:06,359
liners they now have those machines

530
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:08,000
where it'll pop up the unrooted cuting

531
00:22:06,359 --> 00:22:11,399
and it'll actually go and the Machine

532
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:15,278
will find uh a piece and plant it on its

533
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:18,880
own so this was the uh Auto sticks

534
00:22:15,278 --> 00:22:21,200
machine strip or the magazine we came up

535
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:23,480
with the concept of putting that

536
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:25,880
unrooted cutting into the clip but also

537
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:28,519
having it with initiated with roots so

538
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:30,080
it takes off two weeks worth of time on

539
00:22:28,519 --> 00:22:31,720
for the grower so not only are they

540
00:22:30,079 --> 00:22:34,519
saving on labor but now they're saving

541
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:37,558
on production time in the greenhouse we

542
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:39,319
also came up in the heat of covid we

543
00:22:37,558 --> 00:22:42,440
came up with this concept called Dura

544
00:22:39,319 --> 00:22:46,158
Blum and durabl is a series of patunas

545
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:49,519
that is heat and humidity tolerant and

546
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:52,640
says to a hurricane or to a thunderstorm

547
00:22:49,519 --> 00:22:54,918
it can have a basically a hurricane come

548
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:56,320
through huge thunderstorm and then the

549
00:22:54,919 --> 00:22:58,520
very next day the patunas will be

550
00:22:56,319 --> 00:23:01,839
sticking right back up and be sunshiny

551
00:22:58,519 --> 00:23:03,480
bis and looking beautiful um so that was

552
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:09,038
a brand new technology they came out

553
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:15,200
with as well so now what we're focusing

554
00:23:09,038 --> 00:23:16,839
on in the age of uh the genome and cool

555
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:19,400
technologies that are coming along in

556
00:23:16,839 --> 00:23:21,798
the medical world we are now starting to

557
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:24,080
apply those Technologies and predictive

558
00:23:21,798 --> 00:23:28,720
breeding to horiculture

559
00:23:24,079 --> 00:23:31,599
and so in 2015 we started doing a lot of

560
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:34,839
work where our R&amp;D team wanted to focus

561
00:23:31,599 --> 00:23:38,000
on let's map The genome of all of our

562
00:23:34,839 --> 00:23:40,480
different crops that we have and let's

563
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:43,960
start identifying different traits

564
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:45,759
within those genomes that um are going

565
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:48,880
to help solve some of our industry's

566
00:23:45,759 --> 00:23:51,158
number one problems we then in 2017

567
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:54,520
started using artificial intelligence to

568
00:23:51,159 --> 00:23:56,799
help us with phenotyping so while we as

569
00:23:54,519 --> 00:23:59,480
the product managers and we as the

570
00:23:56,798 --> 00:24:02,000
breeding team can kind of go out and see

571
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:03,919
within a full Greenhouse this is a good

572
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,839
plant because it has a strong root

573
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:08,038
system or this is a good plant because

574
00:24:05,839 --> 00:24:10,879
it has a lot of flowers on it we were

575
00:24:08,038 --> 00:24:13,879
starting to use AI phenotyping in order

576
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:17,480
to be able to initially cut out or cull

577
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:20,200
through that first group of um seedlings

578
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:22,000
or trial varieties we then started using

579
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:24,640
predictive breeding in

580
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,599
2019 um where we were looking actually

581
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:28,159
at the genetic material of the first

582
00:24:26,599 --> 00:24:30,678
seedlings that our breeders would come

583
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:33,520
up with as another point to be able to

584
00:24:30,679 --> 00:24:36,038
call through or to faster decide what

585
00:24:33,519 --> 00:24:40,480
varieties we wanted to move forward with

586
00:24:36,038 --> 00:24:42,720
and then in 2020 we opened up uh our BTC

587
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:44,599
company our breeding Technology Center

588
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:46,200
uh in Germany so we had brought all of

589
00:24:44,599 --> 00:24:48,719
our research and development people all

590
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:50,798
Under One Roof and then the following

591
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:53,079
year we came up with a concept called

592
00:24:50,798 --> 00:24:57,398
intrinsa so what is

593
00:24:53,079 --> 00:24:59,119
intrinsa intrinsa is basically a takes

594
00:24:57,398 --> 00:25:01,398
the classic

595
00:24:59,119 --> 00:25:03,798
uh breeding or hybridization uh

596
00:25:01,398 --> 00:25:05,759
practices of traditional breeding and

597
00:25:03,798 --> 00:25:07,398
then is also applying all of those

598
00:25:05,759 --> 00:25:09,319
artificial intelligence breeding

599
00:25:07,398 --> 00:25:11,199
practices and puts them together to

600
00:25:09,319 --> 00:25:13,918
basically solve The World's problems or

601
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:15,558
solve horticulture's problems we have 50

602
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:18,278
different research projects that are

603
00:25:15,558 --> 00:25:20,960
happening right now that are looking at

604
00:25:18,278 --> 00:25:22,919
our top number one crops identifying

605
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:26,000
what are the number one issues for each

606
00:25:22,919 --> 00:25:29,038
of those crops so say for chrysanthemums

607
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:32,240
or for fall mums it's white rust for

608
00:25:29,038 --> 00:25:34,558
patunas it's tobac mosaic virus things

609
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:36,720
that can wipe out an entire crop for a

610
00:25:34,558 --> 00:25:38,960
grower if they have one plant that's

611
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:40,919
infected right and they're looking

612
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:42,880
within the DNA of each of those

613
00:25:40,919 --> 00:25:45,000
different crops to identify the single

614
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:47,159
Gene that gives you the resistance to

615
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,839
each of those different diseases or

616
00:25:47,159 --> 00:25:52,000
pressures

617
00:25:48,839 --> 00:25:54,359
so um basically it's using that DNA that

618
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:56,319
is inherent it's not GMO breeding it's

619
00:25:54,359 --> 00:25:58,839
actually using the genes of the plant

620
00:25:56,319 --> 00:26:02,398
itself which really coming for someone

621
00:25:58,839 --> 00:26:04,398
like me who started out in college when

622
00:26:02,398 --> 00:26:06,479
the first tomato that had been

623
00:26:04,398 --> 00:26:09,759
genetically modified with genes from a

624
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:11,319
fish was like a brand new thing this is

625
00:26:09,759 --> 00:26:12,919
really awesome that we're now at a point

626
00:26:11,319 --> 00:26:16,558
where we're doing breeding that is with

627
00:26:12,919 --> 00:26:18,840
its own DNA which is kind of neat so

628
00:26:16,558 --> 00:26:21,240
we're trying to do this and in order our

629
00:26:18,839 --> 00:26:24,278
Focus here really is to create stronger

630
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:27,679
healthier plants through this technology

631
00:26:24,278 --> 00:26:28,759
using it as an sustainable approach so

632
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:31,840
um so that we

633
00:26:28,759 --> 00:26:34,558
in the end can have varieties that are

634
00:26:31,839 --> 00:26:36,519
uh healthier are faster producing don't

635
00:26:34,558 --> 00:26:38,639
require as many inputs for the grower or

636
00:26:36,519 --> 00:26:41,398
for the end consumer and therefore we

637
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:44,159
end up having less waste and less inputs

638
00:26:41,398 --> 00:26:46,479
for everyone so in

639
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:49,640
2021 um I was part of the group that

640
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:52,278
selected the first uh group of patunas

641
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:54,720
that were fully resistant to Tobacco

642
00:26:52,278 --> 00:26:57,519
mosaic virus to MAAC mosaic virus for

643
00:26:54,720 --> 00:27:00,759
those you who who might not know it

644
00:26:57,519 --> 00:27:03,960
basically cre creates um a discoloration

645
00:27:00,759 --> 00:27:06,919
within the entire uh bloom or Petals of

646
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:09,079
the uh petunia plant and will also cause

647
00:27:06,919 --> 00:27:11,840
a whole lot of stunted growth it can

648
00:27:09,079 --> 00:27:13,918
spread like wildfire across an entire

649
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:15,959
Greenhouse so if you have one plant that

650
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:19,799
you see that is showing those symptoms

651
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:22,919
you're already too late we had in 2016

652
00:27:19,798 --> 00:27:25,240
uh Duman had an unfortunate case where

653
00:27:22,919 --> 00:27:27,320
we had tobacco Mosaic raris at our

654
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:30,519
production Farm in El Salvador and we

655
00:27:27,319 --> 00:27:33,439
shipped cuting across the entire North

656
00:27:30,519 --> 00:27:35,639
American uh continent uh with patuna

657
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:38,320
Johnny flame I have Growers to this day

658
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:41,640
who still hate me even though I wasn't

659
00:27:38,319 --> 00:27:43,918
with the company and say if I ever ship

660
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:47,159
them TMV ever again they will come to my

661
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:48,559
house um but now we don't have to worry

662
00:27:47,159 --> 00:27:53,320
about that because we have intrin at

663
00:27:48,558 --> 00:27:55,678
patunas 95% of our pipeline uh is TMV

664
00:27:53,319 --> 00:27:57,678
resistant which is awesome which means

665
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:58,798
that a grower can grow doom and orange

666
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:01,559
petunia

667
00:27:58,798 --> 00:28:02,960
potentially be infected with TMV from

668
00:28:01,558 --> 00:28:05,918
another

669
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:10,079
source and the doom and orange patunas

670
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:12,960
will be resistant they have a way of um

671
00:28:10,079 --> 00:28:15,558
essentially growing cells around the

672
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:17,278
virus within the plant that the gene

673
00:28:15,558 --> 00:28:18,879
that's been turned on that says oh I can

674
00:28:17,278 --> 00:28:21,440
recognize there's a gene there is a

675
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:25,120
virus there I need to grow cells to

676
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:28,200
close it off and to lock it up so huge

677
00:28:25,119 --> 00:28:30,000
gain here because it basically means

678
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:32,600
that it's like an insurance policy for a

679
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,798
grower they can safely grow doom and

680
00:28:32,599 --> 00:28:36,439
orange patunas without any sense of

681
00:28:34,798 --> 00:28:40,960
worry or concern that they're going to

682
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:40,960
lose out on a season's worth of

683
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:45,359
production but sustainability with our

684
00:28:43,599 --> 00:28:48,480
company is really important as well too

685
00:28:45,359 --> 00:28:51,398
so beyond intrinsa um we're with

686
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:53,159
chrysanthemum say we're looking at um

687
00:28:51,398 --> 00:28:56,000
you know trying to find resistance to

688
00:28:53,159 --> 00:28:59,159
White rust uh with roses we're trying to

689
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:01,480
find resistance to pythium uh we're also

690
00:28:59,159 --> 00:29:05,640
looking at powder rildo resistance

691
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:07,480
within colano caliber COA and verbina um

692
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:09,720
and a number of other projects that I

693
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:12,038
can't really talk about but a lot of

694
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:14,120
stuff is is happening which is awesome

695
00:29:12,038 --> 00:29:16,398
um but sustainability remains a really

696
00:29:14,119 --> 00:29:19,038
important part of our company so not

697
00:29:16,398 --> 00:29:21,038
only how we are producing uh from a

698
00:29:19,038 --> 00:29:22,359
grower standpoint but also how we're

699
00:29:21,038 --> 00:29:24,679
treating our people at our different

700
00:29:22,359 --> 00:29:27,119
Farms across the entire

701
00:29:24,679 --> 00:29:28,880
Globe there are also other research

702
00:29:27,119 --> 00:29:32,558
projects that are happening

703
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:35,679
um across North America uh my friends uh

704
00:29:32,558 --> 00:29:38,839
Melinda n and Amanda solid Amanda solid

705
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:41,559
is also a past Master student here at

706
00:29:38,839 --> 00:29:44,599
Cornell they are both at NC State and

707
00:29:41,558 --> 00:29:46,960
working on mapping or accounting for

708
00:29:44,599 --> 00:29:49,398
carbon and carbon inputs and carbon

709
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:53,038
tracking within domestic flower Cut

710
00:29:49,398 --> 00:29:57,199
Flower production uh Bridget beeh at uh

711
00:29:53,038 --> 00:30:00,798
MSU is working also on marketing efforts

712
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:02,960
and she is mapping eye movement with

713
00:30:00,798 --> 00:30:05,720
consumers when they go into a store

714
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:09,278
where do their eyes track or follow what

715
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:12,079
plants do they tend to look at first or

716
00:30:09,278 --> 00:30:14,240
gravitate towards um and doing a lot of

717
00:30:12,079 --> 00:30:16,519
that stuff with like RFID tracking and

718
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:18,558
things like that which is really amazing

719
00:30:16,519 --> 00:30:21,558
uh and changing the world of retail as

720
00:30:18,558 --> 00:30:23,798
we know it um and there's also

721
00:30:21,558 --> 00:30:26,240
independent companies as well um I don't

722
00:30:23,798 --> 00:30:30,079
know has anybody heard of light bio

723
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:35,480
everybody I'm sure right um then the

724
00:30:30,079 --> 00:30:38,000
Firefly petunia uh this is a uh a GMO

725
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:41,399
petunia that has been bred with the jees

726
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:44,319
from um I think it's mushrooms actually

727
00:30:41,398 --> 00:30:48,158
that have uh light emitting jeans within

728
00:30:44,319 --> 00:30:52,558
them it is really does has anybody seen

729
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:55,440
it it's weird isn't it yeah I think this

730
00:30:52,558 --> 00:30:57,278
has like Las Vegas and Disney World like

731
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:59,159
written all over it right it's kind of

732
00:30:57,278 --> 00:31:00,480
hard to see just one single plant but

733
00:30:59,159 --> 00:31:03,080
when you have a whole mass of them

734
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:05,159
they're pretty amazing so lots of really

735
00:31:03,079 --> 00:31:07,359

00:31:37,278 --> 00:31:41,000
people involved in knowing what

753
00:31:38,759 --> 00:31:45,240
Horticulture is that it actually is an

754
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:47,880
industry that exists um American Hort I

they are the leading Association for our

760
00:31:58,278 --> 00:32:02,000
entire industry and they put on

761
00:31:59,839 --> 00:32:04,439
cultivate every year as well as a number

762
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:07,200
of different educational seminars that

763
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:09,720
happen throughout the year by Zoom or in

764
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:12,120
person they also run the program called

765
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:14,278
the Hort Scholars Program it's a great

766
00:32:12,119 --> 00:32:16,879
internship or way to immerse yourself

767
00:32:14,278 --> 00:32:18,359
into the holder culture industry meet a

768
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:20,080
lot of different influential people

769
00:32:18,359 --> 00:32:21,439
within the industry and really

770
00:32:20,079 --> 00:32:23,960
experience it

771
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:25,960
firsthand and then last but not least I

772
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:27,919
love the horiculture research institute

773
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:29,960
or HRI they're the people that are

774
00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:31,278
coming forth with a lot of different

775
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:33,600
projects that are happening right now

776
00:32:31,278 --> 00:32:35,960
and partnering with universities um they

777
00:32:33,599 --> 00:32:39,000
came out with the research that uh

778
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:41,038
focused on um boxwood blate and trying

779
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:43,240
to find more resistant varieties that

780
00:32:41,038 --> 00:32:46,119
way um so lots of great

781
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:49,720
stuff last but not least some words of

782
00:32:46,119 --> 00:32:51,959
wisdom um I wanted to show share some

783
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:54,079
some fun facts or just some phrases um

784
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:55,840
plants are not t-shirts I will I will

785
00:32:54,079 --> 00:32:57,278
say that I can't tell you how many times

786
00:32:55,839 --> 00:32:58,678
I have said that in my lifetime it's

787
00:32:57,278 --> 00:33:03,038
think I think it's it's really important

788
00:32:58,679 --> 00:33:05,480
to remember consumers constantly think

789
00:33:03,038 --> 00:33:07,278
that um you know plants are easily

790
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:08,759
accessible or that a garden center

791
00:33:07,278 --> 00:33:10,720
should always have the same variety

792
00:33:08,759 --> 00:33:12,440
available at no matter what time of year

793
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:15,360
like a strawberry being available year

794
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:17,960
round right um Growers are the same

795
00:33:15,359 --> 00:33:20,678
way uh and retailers are even the same

796
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:22,759
way there is a supply chain there we are

797
00:33:20,679 --> 00:33:28,159
living and working with living things

798
00:33:22,759 --> 00:33:31,119
right um so things change be flexible be

799
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:34,200
open-minded uh be willing to be nimble

800
00:33:31,119 --> 00:33:36,918
and to try new things right um enter and

801
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:39,960
disperse is a phrase that Dr Miller

802
00:33:36,919 --> 00:33:42,159
turned me on to um as an intern uh we

803
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:43,919
would go either to the cely conference

804
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:45,440
and we would all huddle as like students

805
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:48,360
all as a whole group and work walk

806
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:50,480
around as a pod right and he always

807
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:52,638
advised us to enter a room and then

808
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:54,480
disperse break out network with new

809
00:33:52,638 --> 00:33:56,119
people meet somebody new so whenever you

810
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:58,440
go to a class or you go to a seminar

811
00:33:56,119 --> 00:34:00,879
like this or if you're going to say an

812
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:03,240
industry event go and meet one new

813
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:05,519
person right you might learn something

814
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:08,039
that's really amazing about that person

815
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:10,480
or they might become a contact say like

816
00:34:08,039 --> 00:34:14,398
Dr Charlie Hall who I met who's been a

817
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:15,960
mentor for me for the last 15 years um

818
00:34:14,398 --> 00:34:18,159
and one of my favorite phrases from one

819
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:20,240
of my favorite people of all time Mason

820
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:22,119
day he is also a past cornelian he now

821
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:25,078
works with J.R Peters the fertilizer

going on probably 20 years now since

845
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:23,480
that book was published um it is a

846
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:26,720
wonderful kind of overview of how

847
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:28,400
breeding works and how horiculture Works

um and kind of those kind of influential

849
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:33,480
touch points within the history of

850
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:36,839
flowers um and how we got to where we

851
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:40,480
are today um I also love the book chaos

852
00:35:36,838 --> 00:35:43,400
monkeys break right and and see

853
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:45,920
what happens uh it's written by Antonio

854
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:48,119
arm Martinez he worked for Facebook in

855
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:51,680
the early days he also created the

856
00:35:48,119 --> 00:35:54,599
algorithm that made ads on Facebook and

857
00:35:51,679 --> 00:35:55,519
Twitter we have him to think for all of

858
00:35:54,599 --> 00:35:58,079
that

859
00:35:55,519 --> 00:36:00,400
and Ridiculousness but it's wonderful

860
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:02,480
read because it talks about too how to

861
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:05,160
be nimble how to think outside the box

862
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:06,719
how in a crazy time when Facebook and

863
00:36:05,159 --> 00:36:09,679
Instagram and and Twitter were all

864
00:36:06,719 --> 00:36:11,239
coming about how you just had this

865
00:36:09,679 --> 00:36:13,440
abandon of just being able to be

866
00:36:11,239 --> 00:36:15,039
creative every day and try something new

867
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:17,200
and that there were no expenses to it

868
00:36:15,039 --> 00:36:18,920
right and then last but not least one of

869
00:36:17,199 --> 00:36:23,239
my favorite plant Geeks of all time

870
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:25,358
Kelly Norris he uh lives in De Mo Iowa

871
00:36:23,239 --> 00:36:28,799
used to be the director for the de Mo De

872
00:36:25,358 --> 00:36:32,480
Moine Iowa Botanical Gardens um he is a

873
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:34,560
wonderful plant nerd um and there are

874
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:37,679
fun things coming from him in the future

875
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:38,838
so he is definitely a spot to watch um

876
00:36:37,679 --> 00:36:42,598
and with

877
00:36:38,838 --> 00:36:45,119
that we'll leave everything else for you

878
00:36:42,599 --> 00:36:47,440
questions

879
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:50,358
comments yeah go

880
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:53,240
ahead some of the pain points you were

881
00:36:50,358 --> 00:36:55,440
talking about yeah regulatory one of

882
00:36:53,239 --> 00:36:59,439
them with all the Innovations coming up

883
00:36:55,440 --> 00:37:02,000
with yes so um there's definitely a

884
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:04,000
right sure so the question was um is one

885
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:06,880
of the pain points is regulatory

886
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:08,519
processes or um following trademarks and

887
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:11,240
things like that one of the things we

888
00:37:08,519 --> 00:37:13,920
have to go through or will it slow down

889
00:37:11,239 --> 00:37:16,039
maybe the breeding process I guess it

890
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:19,519
does

891
00:37:16,039 --> 00:37:22,000
um we like to trademark a lot of our

892
00:37:19,519 --> 00:37:24,440
products um

893
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:26,719
and depending upon the crop that you're

894
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:28,318
working with uh I'm fortunate that I

895
00:37:26,719 --> 00:37:30,598
work with some of our fastest crops

896
00:37:28,318 --> 00:37:34,358
patunas are one of those ones bill I was

897
00:37:30,599 --> 00:37:36,440
telling Bill earlier today that um you

898
00:37:34,358 --> 00:37:39,199
are expected to have an improvement or a

899
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:42,079
new color or new variety every say two

900
00:37:39,199 --> 00:37:44,480
years or so that freshus index or how

901
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:48,039
frequently you you create new plants is

902
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:49,800
extremely high um regulatory issues can

903
00:37:48,039 --> 00:37:52,119
really slow that down especially if

904
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:54,160
you're going for plant patents or for

905
00:37:52,119 --> 00:37:56,240
trademarks uh that is kind of a slow

906
00:37:54,159 --> 00:37:58,719
process and a lot of times if we see

907
00:37:56,239 --> 00:38:01,039
something in the trial stage that my

908
00:37:58,719 --> 00:38:03,639
counterpart and I that we love we'll

909
00:38:01,039 --> 00:38:06,679
start that a little early to kind of get

910
00:38:03,639 --> 00:38:09,559
that ball rolling um there's also a lot

911
00:38:06,679 --> 00:38:11,838
of regulations when it comes to what

912
00:38:09,559 --> 00:38:14,880
plants we put at which production Farms

913
00:38:11,838 --> 00:38:16,880
so and why we have production farms in

914
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:18,920
El Salvador Guatemala

915
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:23,039
Kenya

916
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:26,000
um Ethiopia uh Spain which was really

917
00:38:23,039 --> 00:38:27,838
funny because our farm in Spain is down

918
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,159
the road from the if anybody you were in

919
00:38:27,838 --> 00:38:30,358
the talk with Marvin this morning it's

920
00:38:29,159 --> 00:38:34,318
down the road from the strawberry farm

921
00:38:30,358 --> 00:38:36,440
so I knew exactly where that was um as

922
00:38:34,318 --> 00:38:39,159
well as in Germany and in the

923
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:40,880
Netherlands we are having right now a

924
00:38:39,159 --> 00:38:45,598
hard time actually moving one of our

925
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:48,160
crops into our farms in Guatemala um

926
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:50,200
and uh the reason being is that the

927
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:54,039
governments either don't want us to have

928
00:38:50,199 --> 00:38:55,480
that plant there there can be um it

929
00:38:54,039 --> 00:38:57,599
happens a lot to if we're trying to move

930
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:59,960
a crop here into the United States we

931
00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:01,920
have a farm uh that's in California that

932
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:04,280
we work with

933
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:07,440
um you have to go through plant

934
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:09,000
quarantines um the USDA can put a lot of

935
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:12,920
like regulations and say no we don't

936
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:15,318
want this plant to come from XYZ country

937
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:18,559
for both plant reasons as well as for

938
00:39:15,318 --> 00:39:22,679
political reasons so yeah that is a huge

939
00:39:18,559 --> 00:39:25,039
huge pain Point yeah go ahead I'm

940
00:39:22,679 --> 00:39:27,440
curious how you found the transitions

941
00:39:25,039 --> 00:39:30,239
like in your case from luses to for

942
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:32,280
culture so edible to nonedible and how

943
00:39:30,239 --> 00:39:34,679
you kind of like mentally rearranged

944
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:34,680
your

945
00:39:34,838 --> 00:39:40,838
like yes the question was how did I get

946
00:39:37,159 --> 00:39:43,159
from lettuce and wanting to work for

947
00:39:40,838 --> 00:39:44,318
Monsanto to wanting to go into

948
00:39:43,159 --> 00:39:46,838
horiculture

949
00:39:44,318 --> 00:39:49,679
um I almost had a slide on here if any

950
00:39:46,838 --> 00:39:51,358
of you have watched um the good place um

951
00:39:49,679 --> 00:39:53,000
they talk about a concept called Jeremy

952
00:39:51,358 --> 00:39:54,920
Bary I feel like my life has been very

953
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:58,880
Jeremy Bary kind of going all over the

954
00:39:54,920 --> 00:40:02,680
place right um

955
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:05,079
in the early 2000s I I think really that

956
00:40:02,679 --> 00:40:10,480
um when the first GMO plant came out on

957
00:40:05,079 --> 00:40:14,318
the market that was such a huge deal and

958
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:15,358
um I didn't want to be a part of that um

959
00:40:14,318 --> 00:40:17,838
I

960
00:40:15,358 --> 00:40:19,318
didn't you can get philosophical and

961
00:40:17,838 --> 00:40:21,880
political about it but I didn't feel

962
00:40:19,318 --> 00:40:23,759
like I wanted to play God in terms of

963
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:28,400
like what Gene should be in which plants

964
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:31,280
and whatnot um I also realized in botney

965
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:35,039
that I loved playing with plants but I

966
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:37,960
didn't want to be in a lab all day long

967
00:40:35,039 --> 00:40:41,599
and so I didn't want to go down that

968
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:41,599
road with lettuce anymore

969
00:40:41,679 --> 00:40:47,440
um I wanted to in graduate school I went

970
00:40:45,318 --> 00:40:49,358
into wed ecology because I still wanted

971
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:52,159
permaculture was a Brand New Concept at

972
00:40:49,358 --> 00:40:54,920
that time and I still felt really

973
00:40:52,159 --> 00:40:57,598
passionate about helping Growers and

974
00:40:54,920 --> 00:41:00,079
Farmers grow in a very holistic way like

975
00:40:57,599 --> 00:41:02,519
my project was on organic gardening and

976
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:04,680
how do we take the best of organic

977
00:41:02,519 --> 00:41:06,559
gardening take the best of conventional

978
00:41:04,679 --> 00:41:10,039
gardening put those two together and

979
00:41:06,559 --> 00:41:14,639
create like you know Captain Planet

980
00:41:10,039 --> 00:41:16,599
version of growing right um but in you

981
00:41:14,639 --> 00:41:20,960
know 2026

982
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:23,280
20210 the weed you know uh Market or

983
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:25,639
agriculture Market was still very led by

984
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:26,960
it was male driven and it was chemical

985
00:41:25,639 --> 00:41:29,000
driven and I didn't want to work for a

986
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:30,559
chemical company and I was tired of

987
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:35,039
going to farms and Growers saying you're

988
00:41:30,559 --> 00:41:38,759
too pretty like where's the guy right so

989
00:41:35,039 --> 00:41:41,199
um it was Bill's classes actually and I

990
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:43,720
and being an intern just on a whim for a

991
00:41:41,199 --> 00:41:45,519
summer um at the test card and said I

992
00:41:43,719 --> 00:41:47,000
was like wow this is really pretty this

993
00:41:45,519 --> 00:41:49,838
is really a lot of fun I can still get

994
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:52,639
my hands dirty play in the garden right

995
00:41:49,838 --> 00:41:54,920
I uh the C Conference opened my eyes to

996
00:41:52,639 --> 00:41:57,239
like wow marketing is a concept and I'm

997
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:59,000
really passionate about getting you know

998
00:41:57,239 --> 00:42:02,199
plant into the hands of people and and

999
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:04,280
going that route so um it took me a

1000
00:42:02,199 --> 00:42:07,039
while to realize that product management

1001
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:10,760
is like the ultimate Steph White House

1002
00:42:07,039 --> 00:42:14,559
job of being super sciency uh and

1003
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:17,040
analytical and choosing you know a 100

1004
00:42:14,559 --> 00:42:21,159
plants out of 10,000 plants that you

1005
00:42:17,039 --> 00:42:23,159
could get in a trial season and focusing

1006
00:42:21,159 --> 00:42:26,239
on that whole group that that's what I

1007
00:42:23,159 --> 00:42:28,598
wanted to end up doing so I'm I'm I I

1008
00:42:26,239 --> 00:42:31,358
say and company meetings that I bleed

1009
00:42:28,599 --> 00:42:33,880
orange because I think I really do but

1010
00:42:31,358 --> 00:42:37,358
yeah that's how I got there so Jeremy be

1011
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:38,880
me away yeah during Co there was uptick

1012
00:42:37,358 --> 00:42:41,558
and people interested in gardening and

1013
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:43,519
pick your own one the yeah that Trend

1014
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:45,760
still stay high is it starting to drop

1015
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:49,079
and if so how's the industry reacting to

1016
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:51,160
whatever Trend yeah oh so great yeah

1017
00:42:49,079 --> 00:42:52,559
it's a great question so we did see

1018
00:42:51,159 --> 00:42:54,759
Marvin was asking like how has the

1019
00:42:52,559 --> 00:42:57,359
market changed since Co that we saw that

1020
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:58,960
uptick in consumers having an awareness

1021
00:42:57,358 --> 00:43:02,318
about gardening and wanting to Garden at

1022
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:04,838
home both from a food producing as well

1023
00:43:02,318 --> 00:43:08,480
as from you know I can't tell you how

1024
00:43:04,838 --> 00:43:10,480
many plants of privet I grew to and

1025
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:12,559
backyard gardens and privacy screens

1026
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:14,280
that I designed for people because oh my

1027
00:43:12,559 --> 00:43:17,640
God I'm home all the time oh gosh I can

1028
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:22,040
see my neighbor on my window like no

1029
00:43:17,639 --> 00:43:25,838
um uh we as a company had saw a huge

1030
00:43:22,039 --> 00:43:27,920
uptick in it was Bonkers um not only

1031
00:43:25,838 --> 00:43:30,159
from a retail standpoint but but also

1032
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:35,720
any breeding company it was like

1033
00:43:30,159 --> 00:43:38,199
printing money right um but this was the

1034
00:43:35,719 --> 00:43:39,639
first spring so 2024 was really the

1035
00:43:38,199 --> 00:43:43,318
first year we started seeing Growers

1036
00:43:39,639 --> 00:43:46,078
have a a um course correction or writing

1037
00:43:43,318 --> 00:43:48,039
of the market as we like to say um we've

1038
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:50,119
started to see some decreases in some

1039
00:43:48,039 --> 00:43:53,000
key numbers so geraniums have started to

1040
00:43:50,119 --> 00:43:55,720
fall sales of patun ver being a caliber

1041
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:57,639
COA because those are also linked um

1042
00:43:55,719 --> 00:43:59,719
together you go down in one crop you're

1043
00:43:57,639 --> 00:44:04,039
going to go down in the other two those

1044
00:43:59,719 --> 00:44:07,000
are starting to go down um and we've

1045
00:44:04,039 --> 00:44:09,039
also heard from major retailers that

1046
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:12,358
they themselves have had a course

1047
00:44:09,039 --> 00:44:15,759
correction um Home Depot this is I can

1048
00:44:12,358 --> 00:44:18,480
share this had a really crappy third and

1049
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:21,119
second quarter and so their all of their

1050
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:23,199
Growers who sat on all the material that

1051
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:25,559
is generally pay by scan if they're not

1052
00:44:23,199 --> 00:44:27,639
shipping that material to the stores

1053
00:44:25,559 --> 00:44:29,559
they are going to start rewr W in what

1054
00:44:27,639 --> 00:44:32,838
their numbers are for the upcoming

1055
00:44:29,559 --> 00:44:35,680
season and year it is incredibly amazing

1056
00:44:32,838 --> 00:44:37,318
to know how intricately interconnected

1057
00:44:35,679 --> 00:44:40,838
each of those different branches of the

1058
00:44:37,318 --> 00:44:42,519
industry actually is like if you have

1059
00:44:40,838 --> 00:44:44,719
and the consumer is the one who's

1060
00:44:42,519 --> 00:44:46,679
constantly driving the bus like we can

1061
00:44:44,719 --> 00:44:49,159
talk about how great this sparkle

1062
00:44:46,679 --> 00:44:50,719
petunia is until I'm blue in the face

1063
00:44:49,159 --> 00:44:53,159
but if my mom isn't going to the garden

1064
00:44:50,719 --> 00:44:56,439
center and buying that plant it doesn't

1065
00:44:53,159 --> 00:45:00,920
matter it'll sit at the farm or at the

1066
00:44:56,440 --> 00:45:02,318
retailer or wherever so we're back to

1067
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:03,720
we're predicting that our numbers are

1068
00:45:02,318 --> 00:45:07,639
going to be back to that

1069
00:45:03,719 --> 00:45:11,000
2018 type Market size

1070
00:45:07,639 --> 00:45:13,719
um there's still things like the fact

1071
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:15,760
that we have in trinza as a major

1072
00:45:13,719 --> 00:45:17,239
technology still puts us at the

1073
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:22,440
Forefront in the

1074
00:45:17,239 --> 00:45:24,598
marketplace um so yeah there's we're

1075
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:27,960
still okay

1076
00:45:24,599 --> 00:45:30,599
yeah yeah go ahead maret is Shifting

1077
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:31,760
with um house plants and people wanting

1078
00:45:30,599 --> 00:45:35,838
more

1079
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:38,680
ornamentals renters rather than having

1080
00:45:35,838 --> 00:45:41,239
land yeah so the question was about what

1081
00:45:38,679 --> 00:45:44,558
is the market for like for house plants

1082
00:45:41,239 --> 00:45:47,479
um versus St ornamentals um I will say

1083
00:45:44,559 --> 00:45:50,400
the house market house plant Market was

1084
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:53,960
had a huge research in actually before

1085
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:56,200
2020 so in that 2015 to 2020 Market that

1086
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:59,720
was like the Heyday for house plants and

1087
00:45:56,199 --> 00:46:01,639
even with in covid it was still really

1088
00:45:59,719 --> 00:46:04,558
popular but that house plant Market has

1089
00:46:01,639 --> 00:46:06,879
completely tanked that is like if you're

1090
00:46:04,559 --> 00:46:09,000
a retailer right now you cannot sell a

1091
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:11,160
house plant to like save your life and I

1092
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:14,880
think the reason being is because the

1093
00:46:11,159 --> 00:46:18,480
plants that are actually commercial or

1094
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:20,760
um easy to produce on a grower level

1095
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:23,159
everybody has them now everybody has

1096
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:26,359
collected all of those individual house

1097
00:46:23,159 --> 00:46:27,558
plants and so the ones that are still

1098
00:46:26,358 --> 00:46:30,759
the Growers that that are still doing

1099
00:46:27,559 --> 00:46:33,200
really well are those mom and pop Niche

1100
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:39,400
Growers who are selling you know marble

1101
00:46:33,199 --> 00:46:42,480
Queen on Etsy um I think that uh there's

1102
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:44,880
still a real big push and popular

1103
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:47,119
movement towards pollinator plants and

1104
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:49,318
towards natives that is actually one of

1105
00:46:47,119 --> 00:46:51,280
the things I is a pressure for us as a

1106
00:46:49,318 --> 00:46:54,239
breeding company that we constantly

1107
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:56,960
battle with of do we want to promote

1108
00:46:54,239 --> 00:46:59,279
native plants or do we want to promote

1109
00:46:56,960 --> 00:47:02,800
our own breeding or how do we marry

1110
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:05,760
those two together of maybe we breed in

1111
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:07,359
a crop that is a native plant and take

1112
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:10,119
some of those genes from the natives

1113
00:47:07,358 --> 00:47:12,960
that kind of make it a superior better

1114
00:47:10,119 --> 00:47:14,680
growing plant um but still is you know

1115
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:17,599
pollinator friendly that kind of thing

1116
00:47:14,679 --> 00:47:21,199
so yeah

1117
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:24,760
yeah any other questions we're close on
