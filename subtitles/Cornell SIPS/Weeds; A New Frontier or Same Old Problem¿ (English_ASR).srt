1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:04,399
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:13,599
University uh so yes I'm going to talk

3
00:00:09,359 --> 00:00:16,839
about uh one of our most uh favorite uh

4
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:19,079
plant types today and uh as I go through

5
00:00:16,839 --> 00:00:22,879
this what I'm going to try and get you

6
00:00:19,079 --> 00:00:25,239
to do is to think and and I I'm going to

7
00:00:22,879 --> 00:00:27,640
uh put some things on here that

8
00:00:25,239 --> 00:00:30,159
basically might change your thinking

9
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:32,799
might solidify your thinking uh but I

10
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:35,439
want you to to think more broadly about

11
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:37,959
weeds because I think a lot of this has

12
00:00:35,439 --> 00:00:39,839
to do with some of our preconceived

13
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:42,679
ideas and and maybe some of the things

14
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:47,520
that we've learned over time

15
00:00:42,679 --> 00:00:50,519
um but I will just get into this and um

16
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:54,120
this might be familiar to some of you uh

17
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:57,680
not sure but um you know this guy out

18
00:00:54,119 --> 00:01:00,640
here he's he's not real old uh he's he's

19
00:00:57,679 --> 00:01:03,280
laying down on the job but can see he's

20
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:05,079
he's quite frustrated and uh you know

21
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,280
asking him about this new frontier are

22
00:01:05,079 --> 00:01:08,560
you kidding me this is no new frontier

23
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,320
this is the same old thing that I've

24
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,759
been doing uh you know for the past few

25
00:01:11,319 --> 00:01:17,719
years of my

26
00:01:12,759 --> 00:01:20,640
life so our attitude towards Weeds now

27
00:01:17,719 --> 00:01:22,920
I've I've put this into I'm I'm just

28
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,599
giving broad terms to conventional

29
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:27,840
thinking and sustainable thinking now

30
00:01:25,599 --> 00:01:30,839
these are not good or bad this is just

31
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:33,600
how we sometimes tend to think so in

32
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:36,719
conventional type systems you know

33
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:39,158
typically you want 100% weed free uh we

34
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:41,280
know that they negatively compete with

35
00:01:39,159 --> 00:01:44,200
uh available resources so eliminating

36
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:46,000
weeds is is number one priority and

37
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:48,359
there's obviously there's a relationship

38
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,078
with economic uh losses associated with

39
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:54,200
those systems in more sustainable

40
00:01:51,078 --> 00:01:56,118
systems or sustainable thinking uh you

41
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:58,399
know often it's it's density thresholds

42
00:01:56,118 --> 00:02:00,640
how many weeds are out there can I can I

43
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:04,239
get by with and are they really having

44
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:07,118
an impact that I need to work with uh

45
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:08,679
also plant diversity so that thinking

46
00:02:07,118 --> 00:02:10,560
more broadly you know there these are

47
00:02:08,679 --> 00:02:13,039
plants they're adding diversity to the

48
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,000
system and also are they providing an

49
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:16,318
alternative cover whether it's a mulch

50
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:21,318
whether it's you know something else

51
00:02:16,318 --> 00:02:23,079
that allows these um allows them to um

52
00:02:21,318 --> 00:02:26,878
remain in these

53
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:28,840
systems but the impacts of weeds um and

54
00:02:26,878 --> 00:02:30,799
through the literature uh various

55
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:33,719
studies

56
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:36,160
good or bad okay and this is somewhat

57
00:02:33,719 --> 00:02:39,439
conflicting and again it's based on kind

58
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:42,199
of your thinking and and and and what

59
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:44,719
you're kind of geared toward but we can

60
00:02:42,199 --> 00:02:46,639
think of weeds as either they compete

61
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:50,598
for resources or they contribute to

62
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:52,839
resources through you know biomass um or

63
00:02:50,598 --> 00:02:55,639
or competing for available resources

64
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:57,959
they inhibit or assist operations

65
00:02:55,639 --> 00:03:00,399
whether that's Harvest you know uh

66
00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:03,560
clogging up your Harvester or or or you

67
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:06,280
know providing a mulch um Harbor insects

68
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:08,120
and diseases or support

69
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:11,719
beneficials uh

70
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:15,080
increase uh agronomic biodiversity but

71
00:03:11,719 --> 00:03:16,878
maybe lower uh diversity in our natural

72
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:17,799
systems where you see invasive plants

73
00:03:16,878 --> 00:03:20,518
becoming

74
00:03:17,799 --> 00:03:23,080
monocultures uh there's kind of you know

75
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:26,120
this div biodiversity issue and then

76
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:28,239
also increased production costs uh or

77
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:30,719
are we increasing the environmental

78
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:33,840
benefits if you think of a weed is a

79
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:35,799
plant that has some um desirable

80
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:38,158
characteristics so this is a bit of a

81
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:39,280
conflict um and I don't think it's been

82
00:03:38,158 --> 00:03:41,679
resolved

83
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,719
completely but if we look back so

84
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,599
historically we're looking back because

85
00:03:43,719 --> 00:03:47,959
we want to know what what have we gone

86
00:03:45,598 --> 00:03:50,119
through what have we worked on so weed

87
00:03:47,959 --> 00:03:51,680
is defined as a plant out of place I

88
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:54,640
think most of you have heard that

89
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:56,560
definition but uh Ralph wo Emerson has

90
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:59,318
has defined as a plant whose virtues

91
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:01,680
have not yet been discovered so instead

92
00:03:59,318 --> 00:04:05,479
of looking at the glass is half empty

93
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:08,519
he's looking at it as half full so over

94
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:12,280
time now I've I've put this um this time

95
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:15,799
scale uh back in the early days all the

96
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:19,680
way up to here and you can see that and

97
00:04:15,799 --> 00:04:21,240
this is basically relating to weeds um

98
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,199
you know whether we had the firstand

99
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:27,879
implements then we get into horse drawn

100
00:04:24,199 --> 00:04:29,720
um U mechanical uh the chemical era

101
00:04:27,879 --> 00:04:31,759
begins with the first herbicide where

102
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:34,520
for the uh 24d

103
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:36,720
herbicide um some you know internet was

104
00:04:34,519 --> 00:04:38,319
invented in 1973 okay why is that

105
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,600
important to weeds well I'll get into

106
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:42,000
that as far as

107
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:44,680
technology um we have the first

108
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:49,199
herbicide resistant Ry grass resistant

109
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:50,600
to to um uh seven sites of actions so if

110
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:54,280
you're familiar with the herbicide

111
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:55,520
resistance uh scenario or or issue

112
00:04:54,279 --> 00:04:56,959
there's there's different sites of

113
00:04:55,519 --> 00:04:59,839
actions with the different modes of

114
00:04:56,959 --> 00:05:03,359
actions and this Ry grass here is is is

115
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:05,918
pretty major uh and this occurred in

116
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:08,720
1982 uh if we look at certified organic

117
00:05:05,918 --> 00:05:11,279
systems was certified in the US in

118
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:13,400
1990 uh the executive order any

119
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:16,038
everyone's familiar with the the Clinton

120
00:05:13,399 --> 00:05:18,120
error when they uh declared invasive

121
00:05:16,038 --> 00:05:20,519
species as uh something that we need to

122
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:21,918
start managing or they made it an

123
00:05:20,519 --> 00:05:24,240
executive

124
00:05:21,918 --> 00:05:25,719
order and now we have climate hubs

125
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:28,759
developed in

126
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:30,560
2013 and uh the most recent research

127
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:33,080
that I've seen is the development of an

128
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:35,759
automated weeder by some folks at UC

129
00:05:33,079 --> 00:05:38,639
Davis so these are kind of some of the

130
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:41,160
events that contribute to what I'm going

131
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:43,879
to talk about um but in addition to

132
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:46,240
those changes we've also had you know

133
00:05:43,879 --> 00:05:48,519
ecological the theory has has advanced

134
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:50,759
over that same time period and we've

135
00:05:48,519 --> 00:05:53,198
also seen some practical application in

136
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:55,160
our management so that's changed whether

137
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:58,000
we're talking about hand implements all

138
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:59,720
the way up to an automated weer okay so

139
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,038
we're seeing a lot of changes over time

140
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:05,800
time that I think also contribute to our

141
00:06:03,038 --> 00:06:08,240
our Viewpoint and our

142
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:11,560
thinking but weeds and

143
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:12,680
ecosystems they're either resilient or

144
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:15,800
they're

145
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:18,240
pesky and this is based on kind of

146
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:20,800
perception but in in these natural

147
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:23,598
ecosystems semi-natural or Urban

148
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:26,319
ecosystems weeds tend to be survivors

149
00:06:23,598 --> 00:06:29,240
they tend to persist um they're very

150
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:31,680
prolific in in either producing seed or

151
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:33,879
producing biomass and in some ways you

152
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:36,038
could view them as opportunistic uh they

153
00:06:33,879 --> 00:06:39,120
look for niches and I I'm giving them

154
00:06:36,038 --> 00:06:40,918
kind of human qualities but niches are

155
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:43,478
what they take advantage of and and

156
00:06:40,918 --> 00:06:46,639
that's really what we see especially

157
00:06:43,478 --> 00:06:48,478
when you look at a lot of these um in

158
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:50,120
our managed system there's a lot of

159
00:06:48,478 --> 00:06:53,159
disturbance going on there so there's

160
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:55,918
opportunities that are created for

161
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:58,319
weeds so I'm going to talk about kind of

162
00:06:55,918 --> 00:07:00,758
three main areas and this is related to

163
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:03,479
the things that I have done research on

164
00:07:00,759 --> 00:07:05,560
or what my interests were uh prior to

165
00:07:03,478 --> 00:07:07,560
coming here um and I'm going to just

166
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:10,319
talk about these three things just to

167
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:12,959
get us thinking about uh more broadly as

168
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:17,759
far as weeds and invasive plants so

169
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:19,758
super Weeds now super weeds is a very um

170
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:21,840
it kind of uh gets your attention

171
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:23,919
whether it's at the emotional level or

172
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:27,159
or whatever you've probably seen it in

173
00:07:23,918 --> 00:07:30,560
the popular press um associated with uh

174
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:35,080
genetically modified crops

175
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:38,160
um so this article by um uh by kogan in

176
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:40,918
in 2005 talked about super weeds are

177
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:43,479
impossible to kill well they're

178
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:46,799
impossible to kill if you're using one

179
00:07:43,478 --> 00:07:49,878
herbicide and if it's glyphosate you're

180
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:51,439
going to have a glyphosate resistant um

181
00:07:49,879 --> 00:07:56,240
uh Gene that's either

182
00:07:51,439 --> 00:07:57,800
transferred uh to uh the weed or the

183
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,960
indiscriminate spraying of glyphosate

184
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:02,199
onto resistant GM crops

185
00:07:59,959 --> 00:08:06,079
you're basically uh providing selection

186
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:09,360
pressure to uh allow for a resistant

187
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:12,560
weedy plant okay

188
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:14,960
so herbicide resistant are they really

189
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,598
super weeds well we you probably don't

190
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:19,158
maybe you've seen this graph but this is

191
00:08:16,598 --> 00:08:22,240
from Ian Heap and his weed science um

192
00:08:19,158 --> 00:08:25,519
website basically we've seen a dramatic

193
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:27,918
increase in uh herbicide resistant

194
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:29,959
weeds and for those of you who don't

195
00:08:27,918 --> 00:08:32,838
know uh Palmer amaran

196
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:36,598
in the South uh in Cotton Fields has

197
00:08:32,839 --> 00:08:38,880
been a huge uh issue for them uh to deal

198
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:42,399
with and it's actually forced some

199
00:08:38,879 --> 00:08:45,120
Growers to even go out of uh growing

200
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:48,120
cotton but it's a nice you know poster

201
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:50,560
child her herbicide resistant weeds

202
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:53,519
again these characteristics uh

203
00:08:50,559 --> 00:08:56,079
contribute to its success in these

204
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:58,120
cropping systems so I'm going to take

205
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:01,959
you through

206
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:06,639
a a time lapse if you

207
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:10,159
will in 1989 the first uh Palmer amaran

208
00:09:06,639 --> 00:09:12,919
uh resistance was identified in um

209
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:16,078
Tennessee and Georgia if my geography is

210
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:18,879
correct so South Carolina thank you

211
00:09:16,078 --> 00:09:20,519
we'll get to Georgia so

212
00:09:18,879 --> 00:09:26,200
1990

213
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:28,399
91 93 94 95 97 98

214
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:30,480
2000 and I'm just going to go right

215
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:33,360
ahead and just you can see that

216
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:36,440
continually we're seeing these plants

217
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:39,039
2012 and again this is uh from the

218
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:41,360
herbicide resistance website but you can

219
00:09:39,039 --> 00:09:43,599
see that in each of these states at

220
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:45,560
least one individual or one population

221
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:49,159
has been identified resistance to

222
00:09:45,559 --> 00:09:51,359
herbicide so is what is what's going to

223
00:09:49,159 --> 00:09:53,439
happen you know onwards is there going

224
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:57,039
to be just uniform

225
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:58,880
resistance um we hope not but I'm going

226
00:09:57,039 --> 00:10:02,399
to shift gears so there's the resistance

227
00:09:58,879 --> 00:10:04,879
issue but also um in my work I was

228
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:07,399
especially interested in extreme events

229
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:10,879
and what we're seeing in especially in

230
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:13,839
the midwest was significant drought and

231
00:10:10,879 --> 00:10:16,240
significant um impacts of drought on

232
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:17,760
cropping systems and so there have been

233
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,360
a lot of work there still is a lot of

234
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:23,159
work on developing drought tolerant

235
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:25,519
crops corn soybeans things like that um

236
00:10:23,159 --> 00:10:27,838
but for as much for what I know there's

237
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:30,799
not a real interest or there's not a lot

238
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:33,800
of work in drought tolerant weeds or

239
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:34,879
invasive plants now I know Tony has uh

240
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:37,039
written some things and there's some

241
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:40,399
folks that are working on it but as far

242
00:10:37,039 --> 00:10:42,759
as the real um focused effort um it's

243
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:43,839
not it's not a lot of work has been done

244
00:10:42,759 --> 00:10:47,200
on that

245
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:49,560
but just to kind of Define it a a delay

246
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:51,759
in Lethal

247
00:10:49,559 --> 00:10:54,239
dehydration usually it's related to the

248
00:10:51,759 --> 00:10:56,799
physiology or Mor morphology of the

249
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:59,720
plant and uh we see a phenotypic

250
00:10:56,799 --> 00:11:04,240
plasticity where the plant either uses

251
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:07,480
less water it loses less water or it

252
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:10,200
gains access to water through root uh

253
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:12,480
penetration through the ground and then

254
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:15,680
there's also the genetic adaptation

255
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:18,920
where over time if there's it's it's

256
00:11:15,679 --> 00:11:22,679
another selection pressure that um is is

257
00:11:18,919 --> 00:11:24,519
creating um a change in the population

258
00:11:22,679 --> 00:11:26,799
and this depends a lot on the intensity

259
00:11:24,519 --> 00:11:29,799
and duration of that selection pressure

260
00:11:26,799 --> 00:11:32,958
so as I indicated um in

261
00:11:29,799 --> 00:11:35,879
2012 we saw this chart uh from the US

262
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:38,559
drought Monitor and this central part of

263
00:11:35,879 --> 00:11:40,639
the country was either red or brown for

264
00:11:38,559 --> 00:11:43,679
most of the

265
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:46,159
year and so I looked at frag mighty's

266
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:49,519
Australis which I think you folks have

267
00:11:46,159 --> 00:11:52,120
some of that out here uh either good or

268
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:54,440
bad um but looking at frag mighty's

269
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:56,440
common read and its tolerance to Drought

270
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:57,480
so we looked we had a greenhouse study

271
00:11:56,440 --> 00:12:00,000
we set

272
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:03,240
up basically we had the these large

273
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:07,078
tanks where we um uh transplanted uh

274
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:09,399
frag mtis and then we submitted or um uh

275
00:12:07,078 --> 00:12:11,879
Expos them to different uh stress

276
00:12:09,399 --> 00:12:14,559
periods and this we had a low stress

277
00:12:11,879 --> 00:12:17,958
medium stress and severe stress and

278
00:12:14,559 --> 00:12:20,198
basically that was uh related to the

279
00:12:17,958 --> 00:12:23,439
number of days that there was no water

280
00:12:20,198 --> 00:12:26,278
in those uh misac cosm and so for our

281
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:29,440
low stress we had 19 days of no water

282
00:12:26,278 --> 00:12:32,120
which in addition there were four days

283
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:36,320
where it was at greater than 80%

284
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:39,240
available water was depleted so we're

285
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:41,440
getting down to very very dry conditions

286
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:44,039
essentially and so our medium stress was

287
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:47,000
36 days with no water 20 days at at

288
00:12:44,039 --> 00:12:50,838
greater than 80% and then our severe uh

289
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:52,639
stress basically a month of of no water

290
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:54,639
and out of those out of that 60 days

291
00:12:52,639 --> 00:13:00,039
there were about 44 days where it was

292
00:12:54,639 --> 00:13:01,600
significantly dry so what did we see um

293
00:13:00,039 --> 00:13:05,278
in our low stress

294
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:10,159
treatment where we had uh s this is Day

295
00:13:05,278 --> 00:13:14,480
70 so on on Day 70 we added water back

296
00:13:10,159 --> 00:13:17,240
into those tanks and you know looking at

297
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:20,240
this you'd say well that plant is either

298
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:22,879
dead or it has gone dormant well it was

299
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:25,600
actually dormant because 25 days post

300
00:13:22,879 --> 00:13:28,240
drought it had started to Green up now

301
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:30,040
this is just the low stress I was

302
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:32,198
convinced that the severe stress we'd

303
00:13:30,039 --> 00:13:35,838
killed those plants I thought they're

304
00:13:32,198 --> 00:13:39,719
dead absolutely well not the case

305
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:42,199
because 25 Days Later those plants were

306
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:43,800
starting to Green up and you can ask

307
00:13:42,198 --> 00:13:45,838
well did you get all the water out of

308
00:13:43,799 --> 00:13:47,479
that soil we had soil moisture sensors

309
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:49,040
that were basically reading zero and I

310
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:50,720
know there's you know there's probably

311
00:13:49,039 --> 00:13:54,039
could have been pockets of of water in

312
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:57,040
those systems but um very much an

313
00:13:54,039 --> 00:14:00,159
indication that this plant is is very

314
00:13:57,039 --> 00:14:01,879
tolerant to Drought condition conditions

315
00:14:00,159 --> 00:14:04,000
and maybe some of you are familiar with

316
00:14:01,879 --> 00:14:07,679
that have worked on this particular

317
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:09,799
species um shifting gears a little bit

318
00:14:07,679 --> 00:14:12,439
uh cardu newans which is

319
00:14:09,799 --> 00:14:14,519
musle uh we looked at in an invasion

320
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:17,120
study uh into cool and warm season

321
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:20,480
perennial grasses and we had simulated

322
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:23,360
grazing for two years uh we also

323
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:26,240
introduced musle in the first year in

324
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:28,720
the spring of the first year and part of

325
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:31,480
this study was very interesting in that

326
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:33,240
we had normal precipitation one year and

327
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:36,240
then we went into our drought Year in

328
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:38,240
2012 which was um the the worst drought

329
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:40,039
that they've had on record so it was

330
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:42,198
really nice for our study it was

331
00:14:40,039 --> 00:14:45,159
horrible for people that were you know

332
00:14:42,198 --> 00:14:46,838
cropping and and and that part uh but it

333
00:14:45,159 --> 00:14:49,039
worked out really well for us to to

334
00:14:46,839 --> 00:14:51,079
compare that so I'm just going to go

335
00:14:49,039 --> 00:14:54,480
right to the results

336
00:14:51,078 --> 00:14:57,198
um and then again along the um uh the

337
00:14:54,480 --> 00:15:01,199
x-axis here is the the the dates so

338
00:14:57,198 --> 00:15:03,039
April 2011 all way up to November 2012

339
00:15:01,198 --> 00:15:05,838
and then here's our volumetric water

340
00:15:03,039 --> 00:15:07,958
content uh these represent the the

341
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:11,880
various treatments whether it was Barr

342
00:15:07,958 --> 00:15:14,039
musle by itself warm season grazed warm

343
00:15:11,879 --> 00:15:15,879
season non-grazed cool season grazed

344
00:15:14,039 --> 00:15:19,360
cool season non- grazed but basically

345
00:15:15,879 --> 00:15:20,759
this shows you that in the second year

346
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:24,399
where we had

347
00:15:20,759 --> 00:15:26,680
our um uh must and I realize these lines

348
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:28,120
are not really easy for you to see but

349
00:15:26,679 --> 00:15:29,559
where there was not basically

350
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:31,318
non-grazing

351
00:15:29,559 --> 00:15:34,679
so our non-ra

352
00:15:31,318 --> 00:15:37,799
treatments um we had there was water

353
00:15:34,679 --> 00:15:40,120
content but where we had our musle and

354
00:15:37,799 --> 00:15:42,479
and anything where there was grazing if

355
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:44,240
I'm reading that right uh had depleted

356
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:46,839
water down so we saw a difference in

357
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:49,120
water content between these two

358
00:15:46,839 --> 00:15:51,839
treatments and this is a really great

359
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:54,120
graph especially if you're um tired and

360
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:58,079
and you want to uh go to sleep really

361
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:59,440
easily um and and I pardon me for the

362
00:15:58,078 --> 00:16:01,359
the busyness but

363
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:03,160
along here the XX these are all our

364
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,919
treatments uh and this is basically

365
00:16:03,159 --> 00:16:08,879
looking at light penetration into the

366
00:16:04,919 --> 00:16:12,519
canopy over May June July and August of

367
00:16:08,879 --> 00:16:15,000
2011 and then the same thing in 2012 so

368
00:16:12,519 --> 00:16:19,120
so what I want to highlight is at the

369
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:21,720
initial part of our study we had um good

370
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:25,560
plant cover so if you think so if you

371
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:29,639
see a high bar that means

372
00:16:25,559 --> 00:16:32,039
um there's a lot of light uh penetrating

373
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:34,879
into the uh to the soil surface if you

374
00:16:32,039 --> 00:16:36,599
see bars that are low that means there's

375
00:16:34,879 --> 00:16:38,919
not a lot of light reaching the soil

376
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:40,199
surface so looking at and I'm just going

377
00:16:38,919 --> 00:16:42,679
to point out a couple these two

378
00:16:40,198 --> 00:16:46,000
treatments are warm season non-grazed

379
00:16:42,679 --> 00:16:49,758
musle where we added it and warm season

380
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:52,318
um where we just added uh musle by

381
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:54,919
itself or sorry warm season non- gra

382
00:16:52,318 --> 00:16:57,439
without musil so you can see in

383
00:16:54,919 --> 00:16:59,679
2011 it's doing a good job at shading

384
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:01,959
out the uh soil surface

385
00:16:59,679 --> 00:17:04,480
but in 2012 now these are perennial

386
00:17:01,958 --> 00:17:06,879
grasses they should be growing robustly

387
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:11,160
you know providing some good shade in

388
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:14,480
2012 the drought was affecting um these

389
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:17,240
grasses where they had now were allowing

390
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:18,838
uh light to penetrate the soil surface

391
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:21,439
and you say well why is that important

392
00:17:18,838 --> 00:17:24,399
well for mus thisle it's very important

393
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:29,000
and once it gets access to light with

394
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:30,320
enough soil moisture it grows very well

395
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,798
again here's the same thing this is just

396
00:17:30,319 --> 00:17:35,279
looking at populations over time so in

397
00:17:32,798 --> 00:17:37,759
2011 2012 I'm just highlighting this our

398
00:17:35,279 --> 00:17:41,038
warm season non grazed where we

399
00:17:37,759 --> 00:17:44,319
introduced musle so you can see here

400
00:17:41,038 --> 00:17:47,798
early on it started to establish but

401
00:17:44,319 --> 00:17:51,159
then in August it disappeared same thing

402
00:17:47,798 --> 00:17:53,839
in 2012 it started to establish by July

403
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:58,558
those plants were dead so what was going

404
00:17:53,839 --> 00:18:00,079
on in 2011 we had great soil moisture we

405
00:17:58,558 --> 00:18:02,240
had normal

406
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:05,279
precipitation uh we had very nice

407
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:08,919
establishment of musle in our grazed

408
00:18:05,279 --> 00:18:12,319
treatments in our non-grazed plots in

409
00:18:08,919 --> 00:18:14,360
2012 this is basically musle emerging

410
00:18:12,319 --> 00:18:17,558
and then it would die without producing

411
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:20,119
a flower or any kind of seed head and

412
00:18:17,558 --> 00:18:23,960
just for comparison here's our uh

413
00:18:20,119 --> 00:18:26,239
beautiful Barr plots of musle which we

414
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:28,440
did get a lot of attention by people

415
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:30,120
driving but this is right by a highway

416
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:32,038
and they would drive by and say you need

417
00:18:30,119 --> 00:18:34,519
to control that it was you know cuz it's

418
00:18:32,038 --> 00:18:38,879
a noxious weed and we were trying to do

419
00:18:34,519 --> 00:18:41,599
research on it we we were we were um we

420
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:43,320
bagged all the the seed heads so just to

421
00:18:41,599 --> 00:18:45,439
let you know we didn't let all the seed

422
00:18:43,319 --> 00:18:47,399
just go everywhere we were we were

423
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:49,558
bagging the seed heads and then the

424
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:51,559
second year we we chopped all this down

425
00:18:49,558 --> 00:18:54,879
and I I did actually get a chance to

426
00:18:51,558 --> 00:18:58,480
operate a shovel and uh take care of any

427
00:18:54,880 --> 00:19:00,600
uh remaining so um but this is just to

428
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:02,880
just a little bit of an uh kind of an

429
00:19:00,599 --> 00:19:07,079
introduction of of where we're seeing

430
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:09,640
this um tolerance or not tolerating uh

431
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:13,158
these dry drought

432
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:17,200
conditions so uh does tolerant or

433
00:19:13,159 --> 00:19:19,880
resistance make it super well we also

434
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:22,840
know that there's there's weeds that are

435
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:24,880
tolerant to mowing they're tolerant to

436
00:19:22,839 --> 00:19:27,759
to dising or disturbances it's really

437
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:30,440
dependent on intensity and duration and

438
00:19:27,759 --> 00:19:32,879
it's not super but they're actually

439
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:35,360
resilient so phenologically or

440
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:37,960
genetically it adapts to environmental

441
00:19:35,359 --> 00:19:41,319
stress whether you know an example is

442
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:44,720
drought uh it these plants are able to

443
00:19:41,319 --> 00:19:47,519
evolve um as far as their defense

444
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:50,000
mechanisms uh you know and this is a an

445
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:51,679
example of herbicides and they're also

446
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,359
able to access spatial temporal

447
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:56,080
resources whether that's light water

448
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:59,479
nutrients now I I'm saying this related

449
00:19:56,079 --> 00:20:03,279
to weeds but again they're just

450
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:06,519
plants they're not you know some for

451
00:20:03,279 --> 00:20:08,720
formidable foe that is that is that we

452
00:20:06,519 --> 00:20:10,480
can't really deal with and I'll talk

453
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:12,279
about that at the end as

454
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:14,159
well so

455
00:20:12,279 --> 00:20:16,558
bioenergy uh we going to shift gears

456
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:19,799
here a little bit bioenergy research uh

457
00:20:16,558 --> 00:20:24,480
this is just a map of of where some of

458
00:20:19,798 --> 00:20:26,558
the regional um uh uh projects have been

459
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:28,400
conducted across the country and this is

460
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:31,359
a little bit dated it's not uh really up

461
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:32,720
to date um but just to show you and I

462
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:35,479
think everyone is aware of of the

463
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:37,279
bioenergy research that's going on

464
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:39,440
there's several resources there's

465
00:20:37,279 --> 00:20:42,839
several um things that folks are looking

466
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:45,440
at obviously corn corn residue uh

467
00:20:42,839 --> 00:20:47,319
switched grass perennial grasses uh

468
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,960
there's been some interest in miscanthus

469
00:20:47,319 --> 00:20:51,678
uh

470
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:55,360
gigantis biodiesel soybeans canola Cam

471
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:58,000
camelina and others um I just want to

472
00:20:55,359 --> 00:21:01,479
point out there's uh even within this

473
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:03,880
group there's folks looking at um grass

474
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:07,919
bioenergy but there's also been some

475
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:09,400
interest in uh invasive plants as uh

476
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:13,640
bioenergy

477
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:16,519
sources and if you look at these three

478
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:18,679
photos the thing or sorry for my math is

479
00:21:16,519 --> 00:21:21,519
not working real well um you can see

480
00:21:18,679 --> 00:21:23,360
that there's high amounts of biomass

481
00:21:21,519 --> 00:21:26,519
right that's that's the big interest is

482
00:21:23,359 --> 00:21:28,278
how can we create a lot of biomass to

483
00:21:26,519 --> 00:21:29,038
you know create ethanol and and provide

484
00:21:28,278 --> 00:21:30,679
some

485
00:21:29,038 --> 00:21:34,798
fuel

486
00:21:30,679 --> 00:21:36,919
well like we discussed for Palmer uh

487
00:21:34,798 --> 00:21:39,119
invasive plants have some similar

488
00:21:36,919 --> 00:21:42,720
characteristics they're fast growing

489
00:21:39,119 --> 00:21:45,158
High biomass relatively few pests they

490
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:47,798
create these dense monocultures and

491
00:21:45,159 --> 00:21:51,000
there's few inputs to kind of keep them

492
00:21:47,798 --> 00:21:54,918
going but on the flip side of

493
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:57,119
that they that is a great scenario for

494
00:21:54,919 --> 00:21:59,159
Invasion and there's there's a lot of

495
00:21:57,119 --> 00:22:00,599
potential with these plants some already

496
00:21:59,159 --> 00:22:02,880
you know some have already are already

497
00:22:00,599 --> 00:22:05,719
doing their invasive

498
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:07,480
work the weed risk assessments is it

499
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:10,400
anyone familiar you fam with weed risk

500
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:14,200
assessment so assessing a plant for its

501
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:18,278
um it's uh invasive or its ability to

502
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:20,558
become a problem um most of these

503
00:22:18,278 --> 00:22:22,278
assessments on these plants are positive

504
00:22:20,558 --> 00:22:24,399
they're it's they're highly um

505
00:22:22,278 --> 00:22:26,599
problematic or they could be highly

506
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:29,120
problematic peer-reviewed position

507
00:22:26,599 --> 00:22:31,879
papers uh these are just two of many

508
00:22:29,119 --> 00:22:35,439
papers that have opposed uh this kind of

509
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:37,799
a you know use of these invasive plants

510
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:39,840
as well as public land managers I mean

511
00:22:37,798 --> 00:22:42,038
when you say hey guess what we're going

512
00:22:39,839 --> 00:22:45,119
to use these for Bio energy they say are

513
00:22:42,038 --> 00:22:47,720
you crazy uh because it's it's a it's a

514
00:22:45,119 --> 00:22:49,719
thing that we're always managing and

515
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:54,600
then somehow you want to protect that uh

516
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:56,759
to create a a fuel source well a a new

517
00:22:54,599 --> 00:22:58,158
approach I think is is important here

518
00:22:56,759 --> 00:22:59,400
and this gets back to what how do we

519
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:03,159
think about

520
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:05,600
this and if we're harvesting existing

521
00:23:03,159 --> 00:23:06,360
populations and the focus is on control

522
00:23:05,599 --> 00:23:08,519
and

523
00:23:06,359 --> 00:23:12,399
restoration I think it's a little bit

524
00:23:08,519 --> 00:23:16,079
different uh scenario and also if we can

525
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:17,960
uh co-mingle these uh sources with other

526
00:23:16,079 --> 00:23:19,798
resources uh you address the

527
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:23,278
sustainability

528
00:23:19,798 --> 00:23:25,879
issue so there's a paper in uh Frontiers

529
00:23:23,278 --> 00:23:28,599
in uh in

530
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:30,720
2013 they basically looked at bioenergy

531
00:23:28,599 --> 00:23:34,038
that Sports ecological restoration and

532
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:36,079
they were focused on these two U

533
00:23:34,038 --> 00:23:39,519
invasive plants Russian olive and tamask

534
00:23:36,079 --> 00:23:42,319
in Washington state they had a 52 acre

535
00:23:39,519 --> 00:23:45,558
restoration site and this is this was

536
00:23:42,319 --> 00:23:47,480
all a model they did this by modeling so

537
00:23:45,558 --> 00:23:49,798
there wasn't actual you know it wasn't

538
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:52,079
an actual field study but they looked at

539
00:23:49,798 --> 00:23:54,359
you know all the the available tamaras

540
00:23:52,079 --> 00:23:58,038
Russian olive kind of assessed the

541
00:23:54,359 --> 00:23:59,278
biomass and found out that um you know

542
00:23:58,038 --> 00:24:01,599
there's there there was a significant

543
00:23:59,278 --> 00:24:04,440
amount that could be produced per year

544
00:24:01,599 --> 00:24:06,519
and they estimated for decades so they

545
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:08,720
compared their data to National

546
00:24:06,519 --> 00:24:10,558
estimates and basically what they came

547
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:12,960
up with

548
00:24:10,558 --> 00:24:14,960
was that they said we could they could

549
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:20,200
expand restoration activities and

550
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:23,558
biomass supplies which would then uh um

551
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:25,679
create Revenue um well so it would be

552
00:24:23,558 --> 00:24:27,798
supported by revenues from the uh sale

553
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:30,519
of the invasive uh tree Woodway so

554
00:24:27,798 --> 00:24:33,879
basically you're supporting that that

555
00:24:30,519 --> 00:24:36,679
that restoration effort by the sale of

556
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:38,600
the invasive plant biomass so you're

557
00:24:36,679 --> 00:24:39,880
you're trying to create this uh system

558
00:24:38,599 --> 00:24:41,439
that supports

559
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:43,679
itself

560
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:47,480
so I'd seen that I'd already been

561
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:49,720
thinking about this and I I've submitted

562
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:53,200
numerous proposals uh with other

563
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:54,960
colleagues uh different disciplines uh

564
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:57,319
you know just an example of some of the

565
00:24:54,960 --> 00:25:00,759
proposals we submitted we've submitted

566
00:24:57,319 --> 00:25:06,119
to numerous funding sources requesting

567
00:25:00,759 --> 00:25:08,158
up to $15 million with zero uh funded so

568
00:25:06,119 --> 00:25:10,719
if anyone is interested in this if you

569
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:14,039
want to pursue this I'd be happy to talk

570
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:17,519
to you about it um but just realize what

571
00:25:14,038 --> 00:25:19,679
you're up against and um then and and

572
00:25:17,519 --> 00:25:22,960
I'm going to show you some of the

573
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:25,480
barriers of why okay so it's an

574
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:28,440
ideological you know how are we thinking

575
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:30,038
about this there's environmental risk we

576
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:31,960
already know that there's a weed risk

577
00:25:30,038 --> 00:25:34,558
and even if you're transporting this

578
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:36,759
stuff there's potential that okay you

579
00:25:34,558 --> 00:25:40,278
could distribute it you know in the in

580
00:25:36,759 --> 00:25:42,000
the pathway somewhere economical I've

581
00:25:40,278 --> 00:25:43,839
I've run into this over and over you

582
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,759
know these plants are not sustainable if

583
00:25:43,839 --> 00:25:47,599
we harvested everything there wouldn't

584
00:25:45,759 --> 00:25:49,759
be enough to to supply the energy needs

585
00:25:47,599 --> 00:25:51,759
that we're looking at you know so it's

586
00:25:49,759 --> 00:25:55,839
not a particularly energy dense

587
00:25:51,759 --> 00:25:57,919
material um there's social issues

588
00:25:55,839 --> 00:26:00,278
conflicting of national agendas so the

589
00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:03,919
depart Depart of energy says Hey grow

590
00:26:00,278 --> 00:26:08,519
this stuff yet the USDA says no we need

591
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:10,399
to control it so um you know you can't

592
00:26:08,519 --> 00:26:12,240
it's hard to go to them and and propose

593
00:26:10,398 --> 00:26:15,278
something when there's not really

594
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:16,399
agreement between agencies so we're we

595
00:26:15,278 --> 00:26:17,880
we're going through all this we're

596
00:26:16,398 --> 00:26:19,519
having this really good discussion

597
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:21,278
meanwhile the invasive plans continue to

598
00:26:19,519 --> 00:26:24,359
spread because they don't really care

599
00:26:21,278 --> 00:26:26,119
what we think okay so but this is just

600
00:26:24,359 --> 00:26:29,000
some ideas that that I've been thinking

601
00:26:26,119 --> 00:26:31,479
about and working on uh in when I was my

602
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:33,599
pre previous location so the last thing

603
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:36,360
I want to talk about is

604
00:26:33,599 --> 00:26:37,639
Automation and just to to preface that

605
00:26:36,359 --> 00:26:39,558
so in

606
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:41,919
agriculture uh looked at you know some

607
00:26:39,558 --> 00:26:43,918
of the trends that are occurring and

608
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:47,278
we've look we've seen that uh land use

609
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:49,480
in EG has dropped from 54 to 51% so

610
00:26:47,278 --> 00:26:53,880
that's you know kind of holding

611
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:56,599
steady uh labor declin 30%

612
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:58,720
um while agricultural prod productivity

613
00:26:56,599 --> 00:27:04,319
increased 50%

614
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:05,679
larger Farms 97% family-owned um I I

615
00:27:04,319 --> 00:27:08,558
guess I'm I'm not going to question I

616
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:10,038
mean this is a a report by the USDA but

617
00:27:08,558 --> 00:27:12,200
the thing I want to really point out

618
00:27:10,038 --> 00:27:13,919
here is the increased adoption of new

619
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:15,600
technologies and that's really what

620
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:18,000
we're seeing in some of our cropping

621
00:27:15,599 --> 00:27:19,678
systems but in addition to that we're

622
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,119
kind of we we've got these challenges

623
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:23,840
that we're trying to address whether

624
00:27:21,119 --> 00:27:27,119
they're limited resources water

625
00:27:23,839 --> 00:27:29,079
nutrients energy um we have uh

626
00:27:27,119 --> 00:27:31,000
conditions that are that are continually

627
00:27:29,079 --> 00:27:33,678
we're dealing with whether they're pests

628
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:36,440
diseases disasters and now we're seeing

629
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:37,840
you know climate change extreme events

630
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:41,440
but there's also challenges to

631
00:27:37,839 --> 00:27:44,199
Innovation the application Logistics as

632
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:45,519
well as the uh one we always like to

633
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:48,319
work on is

634
00:27:45,519 --> 00:27:49,919
funding but what is the available what

635
00:27:48,319 --> 00:27:52,678
is the technology that's out there what

636
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:55,200
are you know what is kind of the new

637
00:27:52,679 --> 00:27:56,919
thing that that is on the horizon are

638
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:59,640
actually being um

639
00:27:56,919 --> 00:28:02,240
developed well in our our human health

640
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:04,640
system our human health

641
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:05,679
area they now have cameras that can you

642
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:09,000
can actually

643
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:10,759
swallow and uh they can look inside you

644
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,640
different you know find different things

645
00:28:10,759 --> 00:28:16,558
that are right or wrong I I don't know

646
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:19,399
if that's good or bad uh you can you

647
00:28:16,558 --> 00:28:23,440
they can unlock your car from space

648
00:28:19,398 --> 00:28:24,719
now uh we've all gone through this one

649
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:26,558
where you're going through the airport

650
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:29,440
and and they can see

651
00:28:26,558 --> 00:28:30,960
everything um and then this one with the

652
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:33,038
you know they can determine if you've

653
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:36,038
washed your hands uh because there's

654
00:28:33,038 --> 00:28:38,240
sensors that that show uh what What's

655
00:28:36,038 --> 00:28:40,519
actually been done uh so that you know

656
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:41,960
could be beneficial if you have a two or

657
00:28:40,519 --> 00:28:45,960
three year-old and you tell them what to

658
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:48,000
do and they don't always do it um and

659
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:51,720
then here is the one for all you Gamers

660
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:53,440
out there that just you know uh like to

661
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:55,079
get in these now these games are getting

662
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:57,000
real interactive and you can actually

663
00:28:55,079 --> 00:28:58,678
play you know across Geographic

664
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,640
locations and

665
00:28:58,679 --> 00:29:02,519
um but this is the kind of technology

666
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:04,080
that probably is nothing new to a lot of

667
00:29:02,519 --> 00:29:08,798
you and and there's even other things

668
00:29:04,079 --> 00:29:10,839
going on but I just thought um this um

669
00:29:08,798 --> 00:29:13,639
this uh a new biology for the 21st

670
00:29:10,839 --> 00:29:16,359
century they point out that um you know

671
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:18,320
computational sciences and Engineers are

672
00:29:16,359 --> 00:29:21,240
part of this biological research that's

673
00:29:18,319 --> 00:29:23,000
going on this this emerging Trend and

674
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:25,919
this is a quote from Bill Gates back in

675
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:29,319
2008 on the uh special edition on

676
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:31,720
Robotics and basically says when or even

677
00:29:29,319 --> 00:29:34,398
if this industry robotics will achieve

678
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:36,600
critical mass if it does it may well

679
00:29:34,398 --> 00:29:38,439
change the world well we're six years

680
00:29:36,599 --> 00:29:41,719
later and I think we're seeing some of

681
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:45,000
those changes uh Even in our cropping

682
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:47,759
systems here's John Reed uh director of

683
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:50,319
production technology at John Deere and

684
00:29:47,759 --> 00:29:52,640
they're saying that uh uh opportunities

685
00:29:50,319 --> 00:29:54,599
to follow a different path to higher

686
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:56,799
productivity one that involves

687
00:29:54,599 --> 00:29:58,959
automation control and Robotics so

688
00:29:56,798 --> 00:30:03,200
you've seen their 48 row

689
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:06,720
planter but they're also looking at um

690
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:08,600
uh very small individual Ro robots that

691
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:10,440
move in the field and and and that's an

692
00:30:08,599 --> 00:30:12,079
area that that these companies are

693
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:14,558
looking at as

694
00:30:12,079 --> 00:30:17,038
well so what is the idea with this

695
00:30:14,558 --> 00:30:19,200
automation stuff well if we've got weeds

696
00:30:17,038 --> 00:30:22,119
in our cropping system we want to

697
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:24,919
produce this we want to support these

698
00:30:22,119 --> 00:30:27,798
people but we also want to maintain our

699
00:30:24,919 --> 00:30:30,038
our natural resources our economics but

700
00:30:27,798 --> 00:30:34,480
we don't necessarily want to revert to

701
00:30:30,038 --> 00:30:37,960
that so how do we do all this and can we

702
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:40,599
you know use automation to uh help in

703
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:41,720
this process if we talk about integrated

704
00:30:40,599 --> 00:30:43,558
weed

705
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:47,839
management

706
00:30:43,558 --> 00:30:49,639
uh a lot of treatment factors that that

707
00:30:47,839 --> 00:30:51,798
contribute to the decisions that need to

708
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:54,200
be made and I'm not going to go into

709
00:30:51,798 --> 00:30:57,158
detail on these but selection method

710
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:58,480
application amount timing plant

711
00:30:57,159 --> 00:31:01,039
conditions Environmental conditions

712
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:03,639
these are some of the the factors that

713
00:31:01,038 --> 00:31:05,960
are considered in integrated weed

714
00:31:03,638 --> 00:31:08,479
management and then you think about well

715
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:10,840
if we're talking automation we've got

716
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:14,120
machine factors that include

717
00:31:10,839 --> 00:31:15,638
Logistics uh if we're working real time

718
00:31:14,119 --> 00:31:17,918
uh and then also guidance if you're

719
00:31:15,638 --> 00:31:20,359
talking about something that's that's uh

720
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:24,880
autonomous so targeted recognition and

721
00:31:20,359 --> 00:31:26,759
application systems actually are

722
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:28,639
possible and I'm going to show you some

723
00:31:26,759 --> 00:31:32,038
examples of research

724
00:31:28,638 --> 00:31:34,199
if you look at the the literature on on

725
00:31:32,038 --> 00:31:37,398
engineering they're really working in

726
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:39,919
this uh weed science area more than

727
00:31:37,398 --> 00:31:41,398
maybe some of the weed scientists so

728
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:44,278
they're kind of doing this work and I

729
00:31:41,398 --> 00:31:46,959
think there's a real opportunity for um

730
00:31:44,278 --> 00:31:49,359
overlap or collaboration uh between

731
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:51,240
these two Fields so if we talk about the

732
00:31:49,359 --> 00:31:54,879
spatial temporal identification and

733
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:56,319
management of weeds basically predicting

734
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:58,799
uh where the weeds are based on

735
00:31:56,319 --> 00:32:02,200
environmental factors we're really good

736
00:31:58,798 --> 00:32:05,759
at predicting not always versus

737
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:07,759
treatable based on location and plant

738
00:32:05,759 --> 00:32:11,278
characteristics so I'm going to focus on

739
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:14,319
this one uh just in the uh in the in the

740
00:32:11,278 --> 00:32:17,119
next few minutes so based on

741
00:32:14,319 --> 00:32:19,638
location so locating the weeds and and

742
00:32:17,119 --> 00:32:21,518
there's some uh I think there's been

743
00:32:19,638 --> 00:32:24,199
work done you know where are weeds in

744
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:28,000
the field how do we find those do you do

745
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:31,480
you go through and uh you know do it by

746
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:36,200
hand you you do it with uh sensors or or

747
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:39,240
or computers uh but you can create these

748
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:43,240
maps and this is a comparison of maps

749
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:45,679
created either um by uh manual weed

750
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:49,240
mapping so going out and mapping those

751
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:51,639
by hand uh semi uh automated weed

752
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:55,880
mapping uh kind of a hybrid between hand

753
00:32:51,638 --> 00:32:58,479
weeding or hand um by hand versus um

754
00:32:55,880 --> 00:33:01,919
using technology and then on automated

755
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:05,319
weed mapping and you can see that um

756
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:07,559
they're they're pretty close there

757
00:33:05,319 --> 00:33:10,359
there's some relationship there and what

758
00:33:07,558 --> 00:33:12,798
they found was the uh weed

759
00:33:10,359 --> 00:33:15,719
density uh in in most cases the

760
00:33:12,798 --> 00:33:18,079
difference was due to Leaf occlusion so

761
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:21,880
when you've got overlapping

762
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:24,879
weeds it's it's hard for the technology

763
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:26,600
to identify well this is a weed and this

764
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:28,840
is separate that just looks at it as one

765
00:33:26,599 --> 00:33:31,439
weed so that's part of the the issue

766
00:33:28,839 --> 00:33:34,158
with why there's not a real nice um

767
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:36,639
relationship between those two but if we

768
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:38,080
we talk about loc so we know okay we

769
00:33:36,638 --> 00:33:39,839
look in the field where are they what

770
00:33:38,079 --> 00:33:41,599
about plant characteristics can we look

771
00:33:39,839 --> 00:33:43,319
at some of the characteristics of the

772
00:33:41,599 --> 00:33:45,480
plant to help us

773
00:33:43,319 --> 00:33:48,879
Identify some of this and this early

774
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:51,759
work was back in the 1980s uh looking at

775
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:53,919
um sunflowers and soybeans and basically

776
00:33:51,759 --> 00:33:56,558
looking at near infrar

777
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:58,600
photography but we've obviously we've

778
00:33:56,558 --> 00:34:01,158
Advanced uh from from that from that

779
00:33:58,599 --> 00:34:03,759
point on in the early 1990s they've

780
00:34:01,159 --> 00:34:06,440
developed these commercial spot sprayers

781
00:34:03,759 --> 00:34:10,280
uh basically looking at if there's green

782
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:12,000
foliage or brown soil so when the green

783
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:15,359
comes up that's you know an indication

784
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:17,159
to spray um but we're we're getting

785
00:34:15,358 --> 00:34:20,319
beyond that now we're we're getting to

786
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:23,000
where we've got some a knowledge-based

787
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:25,079
ma Machine Vision system and it's kind

788
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:27,320
of based on on these principles you

789
00:34:25,079 --> 00:34:28,280
could you know view this as a decision

790
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:32,200
support

791
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:34,040
um tool but uh visually you know uh

792
00:34:32,199 --> 00:34:37,239
finding where the plants

793
00:34:34,039 --> 00:34:40,119
are and then through a series of steps

794
00:34:37,239 --> 00:34:42,519
identifying those plants and then even

795
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:44,679
going to the species classification and

796
00:34:42,519 --> 00:34:48,159
population and then we can develop a

797
00:34:44,679 --> 00:34:50,159
weed map that's very specific and and

798
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:53,878
allows us to have a strategic

799
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:56,240
approach this right here is the hard

800
00:34:53,878 --> 00:34:58,358
part you can find the

801
00:34:56,239 --> 00:35:00,358
plants but

802
00:34:58,358 --> 00:35:02,719
getting to individual leaflets looking

803
00:35:00,358 --> 00:35:03,719
at Leaf shape vation texture analysis

804
00:35:02,719 --> 00:35:06,879
species

805
00:35:03,719 --> 00:35:09,919
classification this is uh the the

806
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:13,039
problem with this particular um approach

807
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:16,159
so here's an example this is um from the

808
00:35:13,039 --> 00:35:19,358
Norwegian crop Institute uh and they

809
00:35:16,159 --> 00:35:22,799
tried to do some of this work looking at

810
00:35:19,358 --> 00:35:25,679
plant canopy that was um uh

811
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:30,440
photographed uh and doing this on the go

812
00:35:25,679 --> 00:35:32,919
as well so this is not a stop you know

813
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:36,280
View and then Mo it's a it's a realtime

814
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:38,159
uh system because trying to get this to

815
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:40,839
a practical application is is going to

816
00:35:38,159 --> 00:35:43,480
require us to go at a certain

817
00:35:40,838 --> 00:35:47,239
speed so we've got a knowledge-based

818
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:49,920
machine system and application

819
00:35:47,239 --> 00:35:52,838
system um and this is again some the

820
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:55,720
work by the the group at UC Davis and

821
00:35:52,838 --> 00:35:58,920
basically this schematic shows

822
00:35:55,719 --> 00:36:03,000
you that traveling in this Direction

823
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:06,159
with this camera um image processing

824
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:08,318
computer and then connecting it to a

825
00:36:06,159 --> 00:36:11,399
microcontroller where okay we've

826
00:36:08,318 --> 00:36:13,279
identified the Weeds now can we spray

827
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:16,079
those based on the information that we

828
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:18,040
collected uh going through the field and

829
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:19,560
they've showed some success uh

830
00:36:18,039 --> 00:36:22,279
especially where they can distinguish

831
00:36:19,559 --> 00:36:24,920
tomato from night shade and and pigweed

832
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:25,640
foliage so it's very right now it's it's

833
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:28,119
very

834
00:36:25,639 --> 00:36:31,759
rudimentary um but they're really making

835
00:36:28,119 --> 00:36:35,358
some uh good nice progress in that way

836
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:37,880
so here's another um uh you know looking

837
00:36:35,358 --> 00:36:40,799
at it again looking at the

838
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:42,920
shape but also now adding the visual

839
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:44,280
color um looking at you know what are

840
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:46,280
the differences in the color of the

841
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:50,359
plants can we use that to to help us

842
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:53,359
identify it and most recently um this

843
00:36:50,358 --> 00:36:57,279
group uh has been awarded a grant to

844
00:36:53,358 --> 00:37:01,440
look at um doing kind of what they said

845
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:03,760
here is is is modifying the color of

846
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:05,880
that plant to then allow them to

847
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:08,960
differentiate between the weeds and the

848
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:10,838
plant now what is this going to what

849
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:13,920
effect is that going to have on the

850
00:37:10,838 --> 00:37:17,199
production of the plant I don't know I

851
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:20,280
that's yet to be seen but but just you

852
00:37:17,199 --> 00:37:23,118
know changing this color um you know

853
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:27,319
using in this case a

854
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:28,519
a a a gene that could be a way to help

855
00:37:27,318 --> 00:37:30,358
uh

856
00:37:28,519 --> 00:37:32,079
kind of identify our our desirable

857
00:37:30,358 --> 00:37:35,838
plants versus

858
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:37,920
weeds so true integrated weed management

859
00:37:35,838 --> 00:37:40,480
I think we have an opportunity to

860
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:42,559
actually you know pursue this now now

861
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:44,800
that we have technology so we have

862
00:37:42,559 --> 00:37:45,559
sensors that can locate individual weeds

863
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:48,240
in the

864
00:37:45,559 --> 00:37:50,318
field weeds can be identified based on

865
00:37:48,239 --> 00:37:52,879
their characteristics or using a

866
00:37:50,318 --> 00:37:54,838
database and then the a decision support

867
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:58,119
system determines the best

868
00:37:54,838 --> 00:38:00,599
treatment now the the part that is

869
00:37:58,119 --> 00:38:03,440
is important is is as we're working at

870
00:38:00,599 --> 00:38:07,119
the micro scale and this is again a

871
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:08,800
little bit of a conceptual um Challenge

872
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:11,039
and it's not for a field that's just

873
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:13,880
loaded with weeds that's not the intent

874
00:38:11,039 --> 00:38:16,480
it's the intent is where you've where

875
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:19,200
you've got some weed management

876
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:21,039
challenges and you can have a a robotic

877
00:38:19,199 --> 00:38:23,799
system go through identify where the

878
00:38:21,039 --> 00:38:25,880
weeds are if there's a known herbicide

879
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:27,680
resistant weed that computer can

880
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:29,760
identify it and apply a different

881
00:38:27,679 --> 00:38:31,719
treatment whether it's a you know a

882
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:33,880
cutting treatment a burning treatment

883
00:38:31,719 --> 00:38:35,239
but again it has to be at the micro do

884
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:36,920
um

885
00:38:35,239 --> 00:38:39,598
level

886
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:41,159
so advanced technology can account for

887
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:43,640
spatial temporal

888
00:38:41,159 --> 00:38:46,559
variability and since we have all tools

889
00:38:43,639 --> 00:38:49,000
on board they're available at any time

890
00:38:46,559 --> 00:38:50,559
and any location in the field so you're

891
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,800
you're bringing integrated weed

892
00:38:50,559 --> 00:38:55,400
management to the field you're not

893
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:56,960
waiting for different seasons you're not

894
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:59,280
rotating crops not that that you

895
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:01,480
shouldn't be doing that but those tools

896
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:04,079
are there in real time so conf

897
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:08,119
conception to the field these are some

898
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:09,680
of the things um this is a a swarm

899
00:39:08,119 --> 00:39:10,880
technology right now I don't know if

900
00:39:09,679 --> 00:39:14,879
some of you have heard about that they

901
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:17,960
have these individual kind of um spider

902
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:19,838
looking robots that that kind of uh move

903
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:21,720
throughout the field and they have a

904
00:39:19,838 --> 00:39:25,239
little area that they they

905
00:39:21,719 --> 00:39:28,519
manage um there's also some of these

906
00:39:25,239 --> 00:39:30,000
automated um machine that that they're

907
00:39:28,519 --> 00:39:32,880
looking at where the weeds are and then

908
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:35,358
they they have actuators that that move

909
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:40,480
um you know within the row these are

910
00:39:35,358 --> 00:39:42,000
used in in row crops um so you know

911
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:43,880
question are we still at research grade

912
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,318
I think we still are there I know

913
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:48,119
there's some startup companies in

914
00:39:45,318 --> 00:39:49,400
California that are actually uh you know

915
00:39:48,119 --> 00:39:51,599
working in this area and they're

916
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:53,880
actually making some really uh nice

917
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:56,079
advances but in general I think we're

918
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:59,200
still kind of uh looking at okay how do

919
00:39:56,079 --> 00:40:01,800
we make this thing work how do we do it

920
00:39:59,199 --> 00:40:05,399
efficiently so I'm just going to wrap up

921
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:07,960
here with um just some final thoughts so

922
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:10,160
I think I think what was needed is kind

923
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:11,559
of a merging of attitudes not an

924
00:40:10,159 --> 00:40:13,960
emerging but

925
00:40:11,559 --> 00:40:16,400
merging and so what type of thinking do

926
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:18,039
we need to have and I don't really think

927
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:20,760
it's conventional or sustainable I think

928
00:40:18,039 --> 00:40:23,119
it's outside the box thinking I think

929
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:26,720
just a different approach and be

930
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:27,920
thinking broadly uh not like our second

931
00:40:26,719 --> 00:40:31,039
photograph

932
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:34,159
where the young man was thinking are you

933
00:40:31,039 --> 00:40:36,480
kidding me this is not a new frontier so

934
00:40:34,159 --> 00:40:39,559
you know I think our mindset needs to

935
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:40,719
change about how do we view weeds and so

936
00:40:39,559 --> 00:40:44,599
what do we need to be thinking about

937
00:40:40,719 --> 00:40:46,358
weeds are plants you know some and some

938
00:40:44,599 --> 00:40:47,960
happen to be very resilient so what can

939
00:40:46,358 --> 00:40:50,358
we learn from those

940
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:53,039
plants are managing weeds when is it

941
00:40:50,358 --> 00:40:55,039
necessary for complete control as

942
00:40:53,039 --> 00:40:57,358
compared to when can we use thresholds

943
00:40:55,039 --> 00:40:59,480
is there a time when we we can allow

944
00:40:57,358 --> 00:41:00,679
weed or or does it always have to be you

945
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:02,838
know

946
00:41:00,679 --> 00:41:04,559
annihilated advanced technology is part

947
00:41:02,838 --> 00:41:06,318
of our society how can we enhance our

948
00:41:04,559 --> 00:41:08,639
tools in the uh integrated weed

949
00:41:06,318 --> 00:41:09,920
management toolbox I think some of those

950
00:41:08,639 --> 00:41:11,719
things are up and coming and there's

951
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:15,000
either even other things that I didn't

952
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:16,799
mention um that are that are applicable

953
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:19,039
and we all know that weeds are

954
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:21,839
ubiquitous so what ecosystem services

955
00:41:19,039 --> 00:41:24,519
are some weeds providing and how can

956
00:41:21,838 --> 00:41:27,880
those services not the weeds be

957
00:41:24,519 --> 00:41:30,880
exploited you know so what can we if if

958
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:32,240
they're here we're dealing with them are

959
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:34,160
there some ways that we can actually

960
00:41:32,239 --> 00:41:36,000
incorporate them into our system in a

961
00:41:34,159 --> 00:41:39,199
way that doesn't become detrimental to

962
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:43,079
our economics and our environment in

963
00:41:39,199 --> 00:41:45,199
other ways so that's all I have and I'd

964
00:41:43,079 --> 00:41:49,318
be happy to answer any questions I think

965
00:41:45,199 --> 00:41:49,318
we have maybe a few minutes or

966
00:41:49,539 --> 00:41:55,838
[Applause]

967
00:41:53,519 --> 00:41:57,440
so that's a that's a very good question

968
00:41:55,838 --> 00:42:00,159
in fact one of the things that I was I

969
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:02,599
was working on before I left uh UNL was

970
00:42:00,159 --> 00:42:05,719
training livestock to eat invasive

971
00:42:02,599 --> 00:42:07,559
plants so there's a person in Colorado

972
00:42:05,719 --> 00:42:10,879
and maybe some of you familiar but she

973
00:42:07,559 --> 00:42:12,400
has trained uh cows to eat weeds just

974
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:15,480
Google it and you'll bring up her

975
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:18,960
website but in Nebraska beef is like the

976
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:21,440
number one commodity in in Liv you know

977
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:23,599
in animal systems so you've already got

978
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:25,039
him out there why can't you just train

979
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:27,359
him to eat the things that you don't

980
00:42:25,039 --> 00:42:29,800
want and she showed that you could do

981
00:42:27,358 --> 00:42:32,440
that now I had some there was it was not

982
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:34,839
as simple as it sounds but I I that's a

983
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:37,720
very very good you know idea whether

984
00:42:34,838 --> 00:42:41,239
it's um genetically modifying them or

985
00:42:37,719 --> 00:42:43,959
just training them to eat uh these these

986
00:42:41,239 --> 00:42:46,519
plants that we don't necessarily

987
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:49,880
want that that's a very good question

988
00:42:46,519 --> 00:42:52,199
and it's a good segue to my presentation

989
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:53,440
that I will be giving uh in a couple

990
00:42:52,199 --> 00:42:57,279
weeks to the Department of Natural

991
00:42:53,440 --> 00:43:00,200
Resources on invasive plants and ecology

992
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:03,680
so when I was at UNL I had to basically

993
00:43:00,199 --> 00:43:06,480
balance AG agronomic weeds invasive

994
00:43:03,679 --> 00:43:08,318
plants so I I kind of generalized for

995
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:11,039
this audience it's the agronomic side

996
00:43:08,318 --> 00:43:13,279
but the invasive plants you know are

997
00:43:11,039 --> 00:43:15,880
very much obviously like you said

998
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:17,160
they're less intensively managed so how

999
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:19,760
do we address that I just had a

1000
00:43:17,159 --> 00:43:22,598
conversation with um with Carrie the Two

1001
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:26,480
Carries before I got in like where do we

1002
00:43:22,599 --> 00:43:29,400
say okay you know am I am I making any

1003
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:31,519
difference here making any progress on

1004
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:34,760
especially at large scale and I think

1005
00:43:31,519 --> 00:43:37,079
that's where it really comes down to um

1006
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:39,599
defining what your goals are especially

1007
00:43:37,079 --> 00:43:41,440
when we talk to land managers you know

1008
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:43,000
is is it a problem across your entire

1009
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:45,079
landscape do you have patches do you

1010
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:47,079
have satellite populations where you can

1011
00:43:45,079 --> 00:43:49,559
you know focus on those and I think

1012
00:43:47,079 --> 00:43:52,800
that's where we're we're really looking

1013
00:43:49,559 --> 00:43:55,720
at removing those and and and gets back

1014
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:58,519
to that restoration study by those the

1015
00:43:55,719 --> 00:44:01,598
folks that you know in front years and

1016
00:43:58,519 --> 00:44:06,039
but that's that's a maybe an equally as

1017
00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:08,880
large or bigger question but it's a good

1018
00:44:06,039 --> 00:44:10,960
point all right well time's up so let's

1019
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:13,880
thank Steve once

1020
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:16,519
again good job

1021
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:19,400
