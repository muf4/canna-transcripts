00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:04,850
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,218 --> 00:00:04,849
University

3
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:09,010
thanks net thanks for that great

4
00:00:06,759 --> 00:00:11,218
introduction so today I will be

5
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:13,298
presenting on my thesis research

6
00:00:11,218 --> 00:00:15,548
developing perennial grain cropping

7
00:00:13,298 --> 00:00:19,210
systems and market opportunities in the

8
00:00:15,548 --> 00:00:21,160
Northeast I'd like to start with a few

9
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:23,050
acknowledgments I would first and

10
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:24,850
foremost like to acknowledge the land on

11
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:27,580
which this research was conducted and

12
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:28,810
Cornell University operates for

13
00:00:27,579 --> 00:00:30,429
thousands of years has been the

14
00:00:28,809 --> 00:00:32,939
traditional land of the Hyuga nation

15
00:00:30,429 --> 00:00:36,039
members of the hood nashoni Confederacy

16
00:00:32,939 --> 00:00:36,640
today the summe place is still home to

17
00:00:36,039 --> 00:00:38,469
the Keoghan

18
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,480
and other indigenous peoples from across

19
00:00:38,469 --> 00:00:43,238
Turtle Island and I'm grateful for the

20
00:00:40,479 --> 00:00:44,679
opportunity to work on this layer I'd

21
00:00:43,238 --> 00:00:47,439
also like to acknowledge some of the

22
00:00:44,679 --> 00:00:50,259
people that have been quite important in

23
00:00:47,439 --> 00:00:51,670
conducting this research I wouldn't have

24
00:00:50,259 --> 00:00:55,179
been able to do this all on my own

25
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:58,410
so recognizing Chris Pelzer Sandra

26
00:00:55,179 --> 00:01:00,399
Wayman Scott Morris the text for the

27
00:00:58,409 --> 00:01:01,869
sustainable cropping systems and weed

28
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:04,269
ecology and management labs and all

29
00:01:01,869 --> 00:01:06,340
their contributions cindy Bartel who's a

30
00:01:04,269 --> 00:01:07,960
postdoc in the sustainable cropping

31
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:10,180
systems lab has been collaborating with

32
00:01:07,959 --> 00:01:13,079
me on many of these projects and some of

33
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:15,490
our undergraduate assistants and interns

34
00:01:13,079 --> 00:01:17,798
only a couple of them from this year but

35
00:01:15,489 --> 00:01:19,719
there have been many many that have

36
00:01:17,799 --> 00:01:24,510
contributed to this work and I'll also

37
00:01:19,719 --> 00:01:26,349
acknowledge them by name at the end so

38
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:28,478
just to let you know what we're gonna be

39
00:01:26,349 --> 00:01:30,728
talking about today we'll start with

40
00:01:28,478 --> 00:01:32,500
discussing perennial grains and why

41
00:01:30,728 --> 00:01:34,329
we're interested in them why we're

42
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:36,840
studying them why they're important for

43
00:01:34,329 --> 00:01:39,489
sustainable cropping systems development

44
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:41,200
well then talk about thinking in a

45
00:01:39,489 --> 00:01:45,459
systems approach how can you consider

46
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:48,219
not just the growth of grain or a forage

47
00:01:45,459 --> 00:01:50,709
not just the interactions with weeds and

48
00:01:48,219 --> 00:01:53,469
diseases in the ecosystem not just

49
00:01:50,709 --> 00:01:55,329
economics not just sustainability but

50
00:01:53,469 --> 00:01:57,340
all of those things together how they

51
00:01:55,329 --> 00:01:58,929
interact to create a system that can

52
00:01:57,340 --> 00:02:03,250
have either beneficial or detrimental

53
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:05,829
properties I'll then discuss my research

54
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:07,239
objectives for my thesis talk about a

55
00:02:05,828 --> 00:02:11,590
few of the preliminary results we've

56
00:02:07,239 --> 00:02:13,359
seen over the last and then discuss

57
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:15,550
briefly some future work or continuation

58
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:20,530
of work on the

59
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:23,439
projects so why grow perennials well

60
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:26,879
take a step back I think everybody here

61
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:29,469
is probably familiar with the imposing

62
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:33,789
food security issues of a growing

63
00:02:29,469 --> 00:02:37,120
population changing climate changes in

64
00:02:33,789 --> 00:02:39,009
diets and degradation of much of our

65
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,870
natural capital around the world that's

66
00:02:39,009 --> 00:02:43,149
all sort of coming to a head at the same

67
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:45,490
time and causing a lot of concern about

68
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:48,430
how we're going to intensify crop

69
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:51,040
production to feed 9 or 10 billion

70
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:52,719
people without further degrading our

71
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:54,569
natural capital and preventing that from

72
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:57,219
being sustainable into the future so

73
00:02:54,569 --> 00:02:59,650
here we have a diagram from Jonathan

74
00:02:57,219 --> 00:03:01,870
Foley and and others that was published

75
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:04,629
in science that looks at the difference

76
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:06,789
between a natural ecosystem intensive

77
00:03:04,629 --> 00:03:08,590
monoculture at cropland and then

78
00:03:06,789 --> 00:03:11,439
cropland with restored ecosystem

79
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:14,020
services these bubble charts show sort

80
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:15,159
of the magnitude of some of the services

81
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:16,900
that are available from each of these

82
00:03:15,159 --> 00:03:18,939
systems and you can see in a natural

83
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:21,939
ecosystem there are a lot of ecosystem

84
00:03:18,939 --> 00:03:25,479
services that are available mediating

85
00:03:21,939 --> 00:03:28,270
disease air and water quality carbon

86
00:03:25,479 --> 00:03:30,759
sequestration a habitat for wildlife

87
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:32,080
biodiversity but it really doesn't give

88
00:03:30,759 --> 00:03:34,060
you that much in terms of crop

89
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:36,940
production the food that we need to

90
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:39,280
survive in contrast an intensive

91
00:03:36,939 --> 00:03:41,650
monoculture particularly of annuals

92
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:44,020
gives you a large amount of crop

93
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:47,020
production but not so much in the other

94
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:49,239
areas and in fact some have now started

95
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:50,950
to think that instead of it just being a

96
00:03:49,239 --> 00:03:53,020
low amount of services available here

97
00:03:50,949 --> 00:03:54,669
there's actually dis services in many of

98
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:57,130
these areas that are created by

99
00:03:54,669 --> 00:04:01,079
intensive monocultures such as soil loss

100
00:03:57,129 --> 00:04:03,159
water quality impairment the idea with

101
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:04,180
restoring ecosystem services to

102
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:06,489
agriculture which doesn't necessarily

103
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:09,010
need to be perennial but perennial

104
00:04:06,489 --> 00:04:12,310
plants have been proposed to be part of

105
00:04:09,009 --> 00:04:14,229
the solution is that you can still get

106
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:17,439
crop production maybe not necessarily

107
00:04:14,229 --> 00:04:20,168
the exact magnitude of monoculture but

108
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:22,719
restore many of these other services and

109
00:04:20,168 --> 00:04:24,310
therefore create a system that is more

110
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,490
functioning and more sustainable over

111
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:26,490
time

112
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:32,689
so then just to think about what it

113
00:04:30,889 --> 00:04:34,459
means to be perennial I have the

114
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:36,949
definition from Webster's dictionary

115
00:04:34,459 --> 00:04:38,509
here a plant persisting for several

116
00:04:36,949 --> 00:04:41,029
years usually with new or Bhatia's

117
00:04:38,509 --> 00:04:43,039
growth from aprende in part so we see

118
00:04:41,029 --> 00:04:46,779
perennials throughout natural ecosystems

119
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:48,920
not as often in agriculture but in the

120
00:04:46,779 --> 00:04:52,399
context of agriculture a perennial crop

121
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:55,280
is one that you plant and then harvest

122
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:57,529
in one year producing some amount of

123
00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:59,659
product and then in the following year

124
00:04:57,529 --> 00:05:03,469
it'll regrow without having to replant

125
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:05,450
retail do all those field operations and

126
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:07,550
other management's that are needed to

127
00:05:05,449 --> 00:05:12,019
have an annual cropping system persist

128
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:14,000
and so the benefits of perennial as I

129
00:05:12,019 --> 00:05:17,500
said there's fewer field operations less

130
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:20,269
tillage no seeding after that first year

131
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:23,660
there's soil protection and enhancement

132
00:05:20,269 --> 00:05:26,089
you have crops in the ground year-round

133
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:28,430
there's erosion control there's also a

134
00:05:26,089 --> 00:05:30,889
contribution of carbon back into the

135
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:32,959
soil by the deep rooting system reduced

136
00:05:30,889 --> 00:05:35,740
tillage doesn't disturb the soil

137
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:38,810
structure or biotic community as much

138
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:41,689
water quality enhancement by preventing

139
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:44,600
the leaching of nutrients that often

140
00:05:41,689 --> 00:05:46,069
occurs in annual cropping systems taking

141
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:50,090
advantage of the early and late season

142
00:05:46,069 --> 00:05:52,519
growth that these crops can come up as

143
00:05:50,089 --> 00:05:54,129
early as it warms in the spring and be

144
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:55,639
there late into the fall

145
00:05:54,129 --> 00:05:57,759
photosynthesizing and putting down

146
00:05:55,639 --> 00:05:59,990
energy to be used in the next year and

147
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:01,370
there's potential to grow them on areas

148
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:04,009
where you might not be able to grow an

149
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:05,930
annual crop like on a sloped land where

150
00:06:04,009 --> 00:06:08,240
tillage would lead to extensive erosion

151
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:10,370
or in riparian areas where those

152
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:13,210
nutrient movements off-site are more of

153
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:15,519
an issue for water quality

154
00:06:13,209 --> 00:06:17,799
our major drawbacks though in particular

155
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:19,180
lower yields so at this point some of

156
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:22,960
the perennial grain crops we are working

157
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:25,300
with are at about 25 to 60 percent of

158
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:27,758
what a comparable annual produces in

159
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:29,860
grains for a single year and part of

160
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:31,240
that is that there's some catching up we

161
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:31,930
need to do in terms of breeding these

162
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,728
perennials

163
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:36,009
we've been breeding annuals for

164
00:06:33,728 --> 00:06:39,129
thousands of years and very intensively

165
00:06:36,009 --> 00:06:41,848
for the last century or so and we've

166
00:06:39,129 --> 00:06:45,969
only been working on perennials for in

167
00:06:41,848 --> 00:06:48,009
about 40 40 years there's also some

168
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:51,070
inherent life history trade-offs that

169
00:06:48,009 --> 00:06:53,560
have been theorized between a perennial

170
00:06:51,069 --> 00:06:55,719
plant that is allocating more energy to

171
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:57,370
persistence than to reproduction that's

172
00:06:55,720 --> 00:07:00,750
the one of the main benefits of an

173
00:06:57,370 --> 00:07:02,889
annual but there is some thought that

174
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:04,899
artificial selection can overcome that

175
00:07:02,889 --> 00:07:06,759
in the future there are also

176
00:07:04,899 --> 00:07:08,769
restrictions to your options for

177
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:11,740
management in these systems you can't

178
00:07:08,769 --> 00:07:17,079
rotate crops for example so that does

179
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:19,720
limit the ways that you can counteract

180
00:07:17,079 --> 00:07:22,469
disease buildup in the system you also

181
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:26,050
can't cultivate for weed suppression so

182
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:28,810
some problematic weeds might be only

183
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:30,509
able to be dealt with through herbicides

184
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:33,069
and if those herbicides are not

185
00:07:30,509 --> 00:07:34,840
compatible with the crop then you could

186
00:07:33,069 --> 00:07:39,819
be limited in in your response to those

187
00:07:34,839 --> 00:07:41,408
weeds but there is quite a lot of

188
00:07:39,819 --> 00:07:44,560
interest in perennial grains at this

189
00:07:41,408 --> 00:07:48,699
time in particular Patagonia provisions

190
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:51,819
in 2016 release long route kale which is

191
00:07:48,699 --> 00:07:53,199
a beer that was brewed using Kearns ax

192
00:07:51,819 --> 00:07:55,959
one of the perennial grains that we're

193
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:57,788
working with here and emphasizing in the

194
00:07:55,959 --> 00:08:00,698
marketing of that product the

195
00:07:57,788 --> 00:08:03,189
regenerative nature of the crop

196
00:08:00,699 --> 00:08:05,770
production building soil protecting

197
00:08:03,189 --> 00:08:08,408
natural resources and it was quite

198
00:08:05,769 --> 00:08:12,189
successful this led to a further

199
00:08:08,408 --> 00:08:14,408
interest from General Mills one of the

200
00:08:12,189 --> 00:08:18,478
larger food industry firms and their

201
00:08:14,408 --> 00:08:19,930
Cascadian farms organic division which

202
00:08:18,478 --> 00:08:21,579
wants in court

203
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:24,150
turns into some of their products and

204
00:08:21,579 --> 00:08:26,740
General Mills is even interested in

205
00:08:24,149 --> 00:08:28,359
incorporating perennial grains into

206
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:30,340
their entire product line things like

207
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:32,440
Cheerios as part of their corporate

208
00:08:30,339 --> 00:08:33,299
commitment to reducing greenhouse gas

209
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:37,149
emissions

210
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:38,889
so they have donated money towards

211
00:08:37,149 --> 00:08:40,538
research and they're very involved in

212
00:08:38,889 --> 00:08:43,809
the research and development of these

213
00:08:40,538 --> 00:08:47,259
crops so with that amount of industry

214
00:08:43,809 --> 00:08:48,599
support there has been quite a increase

215
00:08:47,259 --> 00:08:51,990
in the amount of research and other

216
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:54,820
activity in the perennial grains area

217
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:57,339
from our work here at Cornell we're

218
00:08:54,820 --> 00:09:00,310
using two varieties of Freddy or grain

219
00:08:57,339 --> 00:09:02,890
as I mentioned earlier Kern's a-- is a

220
00:09:00,309 --> 00:09:06,789
fine opium intermedia more intermediate

221
00:09:02,889 --> 00:09:10,240
wheat grass this is a domesticated wild

222
00:09:06,789 --> 00:09:12,189
relative of annual wheat so there are

223
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:14,259
two main ways of developing a perennial

224
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:16,149
grain crop you can either domesticate a

225
00:09:14,259 --> 00:09:19,269
wild perennial plant or you can

226
00:09:16,149 --> 00:09:21,850
hybridize a current annual crop plant

227
00:09:19,269 --> 00:09:24,278
with perennial relatives and try to

228
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:26,170
introduce those perennial genes so

229
00:09:24,278 --> 00:09:29,500
Kearns Oh was domesticated actually

230
00:09:26,169 --> 00:09:31,539
starting around this area in the 1980s

231
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:33,309
Peggy Wagner at the Rodale Institute in

232
00:09:31,539 --> 00:09:36,958
collaboration with folks at the Big

233
00:09:33,309 --> 00:09:38,769
Flats plant materials Center selected

234
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:41,889
intermediate wheatgrass is the most

235
00:09:38,769 --> 00:09:43,720
promising of several hundred wild

236
00:09:41,889 --> 00:09:46,600
perennial grasses that that were

237
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:50,290
screened and then did several cycles of

238
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:52,509
breeding and improvement there in work

239
00:09:50,289 --> 00:09:55,480
towards a perennial grade in the early

240
00:09:52,509 --> 00:09:57,069
2000s that germ plasm was transferred to

241
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:59,680
the Land Institute in Salina Kansas

242
00:09:57,070 --> 00:10:03,040
where a breeding project has been in

243
00:09:59,679 --> 00:10:05,139
place for the last two decades working

244
00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:08,019
to develop what was eventually termed

245
00:10:05,139 --> 00:10:10,899
Kearns ax which is the the most

246
00:10:08,019 --> 00:10:13,000
productive of their varieties and has

247
00:10:10,899 --> 00:10:17,169
now been used in commercial food

248
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:20,769
products we also have a Swan rye which

249
00:10:17,169 --> 00:10:23,620
is sakali cereal so your annual rye butt

250
00:10:20,769 --> 00:10:26,230
has been bred with a scaly strict a

251
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:28,929
mountain rye and then and then back

252
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:31,060
crossed to get some perennial genes into

253
00:10:28,929 --> 00:10:33,549
that that rye this was originally

254
00:10:31,059 --> 00:10:36,849
started the program was started in

255
00:10:33,549 --> 00:10:39,250
Germany and then moved to agri-food

256
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:42,220
Canada Lethbridge Research Center where

257
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:47,350
it was the ACE one variety in particular

258
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:49,509
was created so now that we have these

259
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:52,120
crops there's a lot of interest from the

260
00:10:49,509 --> 00:10:53,708
food industry there's a lot of interest

261
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:56,440
in the sustainable agricultural

262
00:10:53,708 --> 00:10:58,899
community about them we have to figure

263
00:10:56,440 --> 00:11:00,730
out how to grow them we also have to

264
00:10:58,899 --> 00:11:03,458
figure out whether these ecosystem

265
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:06,430
services that people have been touting

266
00:11:03,458 --> 00:11:08,489
are actually being realized and what's

267
00:11:06,429 --> 00:11:11,109
the magnitude of those benefits in

268
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:12,519
practice we have to figure out how they

269
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:13,839
can fit into our current cropping

270
00:11:12,519 --> 00:11:15,970
systems is this something that's gonna

271
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:18,279
be widespread adoption or is it really

272
00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:19,778
going to be in those small niche areas

273
00:11:18,278 --> 00:11:22,360
where you wouldn't be able to plant an

274
00:11:19,778 --> 00:11:25,570
annual crop because of erosion control

275
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:28,180
for example and then how do they fit

276
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:31,360
into the food system if we produce these

277
00:11:28,179 --> 00:11:34,509
grains and we need to figure out how we

278
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:36,850
can eat them for example Kearns ax does

279
00:11:34,509 --> 00:11:39,819
not have the same gluten as wheat so

280
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:43,240
baking properties are much different the

281
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:45,250
same ace rye is a little bit more

282
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:48,180
similar to what you would do with an

283
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:51,190
annual radix it is I'm just a hybrid but

284
00:11:48,179 --> 00:11:53,169
even figuring out whether perennial as a

285
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:55,839
value-added proposition similar to

286
00:11:53,169 --> 00:11:57,458
organic produce is something that can

287
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:59,680
make these things more economic

288
00:11:57,458 --> 00:12:01,649
economically viable needs to be

289
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:04,059
determined

290
00:12:01,649 --> 00:12:05,980
so I didn't mention we're going to talk

291
00:12:04,059 --> 00:12:09,338
about this from a systems perspective so

292
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:13,089
here we have a diagram of a typical

293
00:12:09,339 --> 00:12:15,160
cropping system you have some natural

294
00:12:13,089 --> 00:12:17,020
resources that are inputting energy and

295
00:12:15,159 --> 00:12:19,569
material to the system you have some

296
00:12:17,019 --> 00:12:21,850
purchased inputs soil amendments seed

297
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:22,959
fuel labor tools and then you have all

298
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:24,879
the interactions that are happening

299
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:27,729
within the boundaries of the system

300
00:12:24,879 --> 00:12:29,769
itself interactions with soil and then

301
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:33,970
operations like tillage and planting

302
00:12:29,769 --> 00:12:35,698
that create a a crop that is then

303
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:38,079
harvested and produces products

304
00:12:35,698 --> 00:12:41,019
there's also interactions with other

305
00:12:38,078 --> 00:12:43,929
species in the system non crop plants or

306
00:12:41,019 --> 00:12:46,179
weeds pathogens and vertebrate pests

307
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:47,349
other animals that can contribute to

308
00:12:46,179 --> 00:12:49,959
yield reduction

309
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:53,940
there's also the economic component of

310
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:57,040
assets of machinery and capital that are

311
00:12:53,940 --> 00:13:00,100
integral to this whole the function of

312
00:12:57,039 --> 00:13:02,049
it and so if we think about this in

313
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:04,840
terms of where perennial is going to

314
00:13:02,049 --> 00:13:07,120
change this it's going to change the

315
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:08,530
soil because of reduced tillage it's

316
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:11,259
going to change some of these inputs

317
00:13:08,529 --> 00:13:13,829
there's less planting there's less fuel

318
00:13:11,259 --> 00:13:16,629
and labor going into those operations

319
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:19,750
the crop itself needs to be understood

320
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:22,870
and how its producing grain and and

321
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:25,830
potentially forage and the magnitude of

322
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:29,110
that and how to better optimize a system

323
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:30,700
we found recently that harvesting and

324
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:33,610
processing of these crops is not a

325
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:35,200
trivial matter they can behave quite

326
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:37,419
differently than what you would expect

327
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:41,879
with annuals for reasons like smaller

328
00:13:37,419 --> 00:13:44,549
seed size adhering holes on the grain

329
00:13:41,879 --> 00:13:46,990
they're not quite as free threshing as

330
00:13:44,549 --> 00:13:50,199
the annuals that have been developed for

331
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:53,740
that purpose are and then in particular

332
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:56,770
the interactions with these pests and

333
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:59,289
pathogens in the system where you can't

334
00:13:56,769 --> 00:14:00,819
use some of your typical management

335
00:13:59,289 --> 00:14:06,339
tools that you would an annual system

336
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:08,050
needs to be studied oh and finally once

337
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:10,090
we get to this stage with crop products

338
00:14:08,049 --> 00:14:15,009
where are we going to sell them for how

339
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:17,129
much that's a big question as well so

340
00:14:15,009 --> 00:14:19,659
thinking about those things we have

341
00:14:17,129 --> 00:14:21,939
developed five research objectives for

342
00:14:19,659 --> 00:14:24,429
one of our projects at Musgrave research

343
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:26,260
farm we want to quantify agronomic

344
00:14:24,429 --> 00:14:29,049
productivity of the two perennial grain

345
00:14:26,259 --> 00:14:31,809
varieties we have understand the pest

346
00:14:29,049 --> 00:14:34,659
dynamics assess impacts on soil health

347
00:14:31,809 --> 00:14:36,849
and erosion potential estimate

348
00:14:34,659 --> 00:14:38,379
break-even price points for the

349
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:40,720
perennial grains in comparison to

350
00:14:38,379 --> 00:14:42,759
annuals and then evaluate the

351
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:46,029
system-wide environmental sustainability

352
00:14:42,759 --> 00:14:48,419
of these systems using two different

353
00:14:46,029 --> 00:14:48,419
metrics

354
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:54,080
I'll just go through a few slides where

355
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:55,520
we highlight the different parts of the

356
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:57,410
system that we're looking at for each of

357
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:59,629
these objectives so in terms of

358
00:14:57,409 --> 00:15:01,669
agronomic productivity it really is at

359
00:14:59,629 --> 00:15:03,470
the level of the crop plant and getting

360
00:15:01,669 --> 00:15:06,889
those crop products that are what we're

361
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:10,339
hoping to produce with the system but

362
00:15:06,889 --> 00:15:12,259
this does involve things I'm not in this

363
00:15:10,339 --> 00:15:13,580
study particularly but there's so many

364
00:15:12,259 --> 00:15:16,189
things that go into agronomic

365
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:17,360
productivity what's the row spacing

366
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:19,610
what's the seeding rate what's the

367
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:22,669
fertilization rate what's the harvesting

368
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:24,589
method what's the post harvest

369
00:15:22,669 --> 00:15:25,939
processing so all of that is something

370
00:15:24,589 --> 00:15:30,050
that needs to be considered before

371
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:33,430
perennial grains can become a bigger

372
00:15:30,049 --> 00:15:36,379
part of our sustainable cropping systems

373
00:15:33,429 --> 00:15:40,250
our second objective understanding pest

374
00:15:36,379 --> 00:15:42,470
dynamics what species of weeds are going

375
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:46,159
to be most problematic what pathogens

376
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:47,959
are going to be infecting the the

377
00:15:46,159 --> 00:15:49,490
perennial grains is it the same or is it

378
00:15:47,958 --> 00:15:51,199
different than what we see on annual

379
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:56,289
grains and what's the magnitude and the

380
00:15:51,200 --> 00:16:01,160
impact of these these pests on grain

381
00:15:56,289 --> 00:16:03,230
productivity and grain quality we want

382
00:16:01,159 --> 00:16:05,328
to look at soil health as one of the

383
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:07,070
main ecosystem services from that could

384
00:16:05,328 --> 00:16:09,828
be realized from perennial grains we

385
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:12,170
want to quantify effects on physical

386
00:16:09,828 --> 00:16:14,000
chemical and biological characteristics

387
00:16:12,169 --> 00:16:16,909
of the soil we also want to better

388
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:19,610
understand the erosion factor how much

389
00:16:16,909 --> 00:16:22,059
can this can these crops prevent erosion

390
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:22,060
and

391
00:16:22,679 --> 00:16:30,838
even potentially add to soil carbon

392
00:16:24,269 --> 00:16:33,778
sequestration the economic piece of it

393
00:16:30,839 --> 00:16:36,270
is to figure out what's the starting

394
00:16:33,778 --> 00:16:38,549
point for for a grain prices for these

395
00:16:36,269 --> 00:16:40,379
are they going to be commodity crops

396
00:16:38,549 --> 00:16:42,479
that are just used similarly to other

397
00:16:40,379 --> 00:16:46,230
grains in the market or are they going

398
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:49,110
to be in a niche market place in using

399
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:51,839
enterprise budgeting techniques to

400
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:54,060
quantify all of the inputs and then the

401
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:56,670
productivity of a system we can start to

402
00:16:54,059 --> 00:16:59,250
understand what the price point for a

403
00:16:56,669 --> 00:17:03,750
perennial grain would be and then where

404
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:05,720
it might fit into a food system finally

405
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:07,799
we're going to evaluate system-wide

406
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:09,900
environmental sustainability by

407
00:17:07,799 --> 00:17:12,779
quantifying all of the inputs and

408
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:16,380
outputs of the system and then comparing

409
00:17:12,779 --> 00:17:21,328
them with annual crops to see what the

410
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:23,819
benefits might be here so all of this is

411
00:17:21,328 --> 00:17:25,740
being done in a with using data from a

412
00:17:23,818 --> 00:17:28,308
field experiment that was established at

413
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:32,130
Musgrave research farm the fall of 2016

414
00:17:28,308 --> 00:17:33,629
we're comparing two perennial grains the

415
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:35,850
Kern's the intermediate wheatgrass and

416
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:39,420
ace one perennial rye so a warthog

417
00:17:35,849 --> 00:17:42,029
winter wheat and two varieties of winter

418
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:45,269
malting barley in a randomized complete

419
00:17:42,029 --> 00:17:52,509
block design and the treatment of frost

420
00:17:45,269 --> 00:17:55,089
seeded medium red clover so just a side

421
00:17:52,509 --> 00:17:57,069
about red clover we're interested in

422
00:17:55,089 --> 00:17:58,649
intercropping and interceding in the

423
00:17:57,069 --> 00:18:00,609
sustainable cropping systems lab

424
00:17:58,650 --> 00:18:02,680
increasing the biodiversity of

425
00:18:00,609 --> 00:18:05,139
agricultural system and looking for

426
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:09,430
complementarity between different

427
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:12,670
species of plants and so legume inter

428
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:16,150
crops with with grass is a very commonly

429
00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:17,880
used mixture there's complementarity

430
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:21,390
there with the legumes fixing nitrogen

431
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:23,260
to allow the grasses to grow better

432
00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:25,570
legumes can also provide weed

433
00:18:23,259 --> 00:18:27,789
suppression they can moderate the soil

434
00:18:25,569 --> 00:18:30,399
climate increasing soil moisture and

435
00:18:27,789 --> 00:18:34,899
reducing evaporation and they can

436
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:38,259
contribute to a more diverse and soil

437
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:40,810
microbiota so we chose medium red clover

438
00:18:38,259 --> 00:18:43,390
as legume we're going to inter crop in

439
00:18:40,809 --> 00:18:45,190
our systems due to previous work they've

440
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:48,340
been done with alfalfa white clove or

441
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:49,539
sweet clover that showed that Kern's in

442
00:18:48,339 --> 00:18:52,329
particular being a very competitive

443
00:18:49,539 --> 00:18:54,609
grass would out-compete some of the the

444
00:18:52,329 --> 00:18:56,500
other legumes and medium red clover is a

445
00:18:54,609 --> 00:18:59,229
little bit more vigorous we seeded it at

446
00:18:56,500 --> 00:19:01,539
a relatively high rate in order to try

447
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:02,920
to overcome that competitive effect and

448
00:19:01,539 --> 00:19:05,319
it seems to have worked I'll show some

449
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:07,300
slides about that but it might be hard

450
00:19:05,319 --> 00:19:10,000
to see here but in one of our split

451
00:19:07,299 --> 00:19:11,529
plots you can see the side with clover

452
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,230
in it being just a little bit more green

453
00:19:11,529 --> 00:19:17,889
on the side without and the same thing

454
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:22,799
happened with Kern's ahir clover and

455
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:25,290
then no clover so in fall

456
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:28,409
tene it was established just some

457
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:32,789
details about a false seed bed was used

458
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:36,660
to reduce weed pressure applied a target

459
00:19:32,789 --> 00:19:38,960
of 75 kilograms of nitrogen split

460
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:42,330
between fall and spring and then just

461
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:44,340
some seeding seeding rate details

462
00:19:42,329 --> 00:19:46,259
seeding rates were provided by the

463
00:19:44,339 --> 00:19:48,720
perennial grain breeding programs that

464
00:19:46,259 --> 00:19:51,240
received seed from and the annuals were

465
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:53,970
based on information from our farmer

466
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:57,960
Advisory Board of local organic grain

467
00:19:53,970 --> 00:20:00,930
farmers so to look at what it looked

468
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:03,059
like in fall 2016 Kern's they did not

469
00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:04,440
look great and it's something we've

470
00:20:03,059 --> 00:20:06,750
learned that it is a little bit slower

471
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:09,269
to establish and it takes off in the

472
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:11,670
following spring but it was a little bit

473
00:20:09,269 --> 00:20:14,339
worrisome at the time our wheat and

474
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:16,970
barley looked fine the Rye was a little

475
00:20:14,339 --> 00:20:21,089
bit patchy but that also did show in

476
00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:23,069
moving forward to the first harvest we

477
00:20:21,089 --> 00:20:24,599
did have a couple of issues as I said

478
00:20:23,069 --> 00:20:26,909
the Kearns

479
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:28,139
did fill in but maybe not at the stand

480
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:30,810
density we would have liked

481
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:32,370
barley had some winterkill issues in

482
00:20:30,809 --> 00:20:35,159
that first year which is actually why we

483
00:20:32,369 --> 00:20:36,689
switched our variety of barley into the

484
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:39,480
second year to a more winter hardy

485
00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:41,340
variety and there were some significant

486
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:43,829
lodging problems with the ace one rise

487
00:20:41,339 --> 00:20:45,959
is a six six and a half foot tall crop

488
00:20:43,829 --> 00:20:48,480
and we may have seated at a high rate

489
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:52,319
there may be other factors influencing

490
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:57,519
this but in some pots lodging was as

491
00:20:52,319 --> 00:21:00,279
high as 60% in our second

492
00:20:57,519 --> 00:21:03,430
serviced you'll notice in particular

493
00:21:00,279 --> 00:21:06,549
that in the rye with clover

494
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:08,620
there was a persistence issue we lost

495
00:21:06,549 --> 00:21:11,680
almost all the rye in that in that

496
00:21:08,619 --> 00:21:13,569
second overwintering where there was no

497
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:17,529
clover there was some rye but it was

498
00:21:13,569 --> 00:21:20,829
still not enough to combine so this is

499
00:21:17,529 --> 00:21:23,349
one of the major things to be aware of

500
00:21:20,829 --> 00:21:26,169
in terms of certain perennial crops

501
00:21:23,349 --> 00:21:27,869
there their persistence is important if

502
00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:30,730
they're going to be part of a productive

503
00:21:27,869 --> 00:21:32,919
system we did figure out how to grow

504
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:35,950
barley a little bit better in the second

505
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:38,140
year and then Kern's ax did regrow quite

506
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:41,830
vigorously although we did notice that

507
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:43,000
its reproductive bigger was a little bit

508
00:21:41,829 --> 00:21:45,359
lower in the second year that's

509
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:47,680
something that's been found in other

510
00:21:45,359 --> 00:21:50,019
projects with these grains that their

511
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:54,029
yields do decline over time with the age

512
00:21:50,019 --> 00:21:56,670
of the stand so now I'll go into some

513
00:21:54,029 --> 00:21:58,839
preliminary results so for our first

514
00:21:56,670 --> 00:22:02,680
objective looking at agronomic

515
00:21:58,839 --> 00:22:05,859
productivity we collected biomass

516
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:10,360
samples in 2017 and 2018 and 1/2 meter

517
00:22:05,859 --> 00:22:13,029
squared quadrats we separated crop

518
00:22:10,359 --> 00:22:15,429
biomass from weed biomass and then

519
00:22:13,029 --> 00:22:18,910
separated the crop biomass into stems

520
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:20,890
and seed heads we did look at components

521
00:22:18,910 --> 00:22:23,170
of yields from a subsample of those seed

522
00:22:20,890 --> 00:22:26,140
heads one thing to mention about Kern's

523
00:22:23,170 --> 00:22:27,910
is that doesn't need to be d hold and we

524
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:30,610
also harvested a strip from each of

525
00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:35,890
these plots using a al Meiko plot

526
00:22:30,609 --> 00:22:39,669
combine so to look at stand density in

527
00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:42,520
2017 and 2018 barley was low due to

528
00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:45,220
winter kill Kearns is consistent across

529
00:22:42,519 --> 00:22:47,109
the two years rye we're seeing

530
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:50,769
particularly with clover in the second

531
00:22:47,109 --> 00:22:54,189
year was very low density and otherwise

532
00:22:50,769 --> 00:22:57,519
reasonable stem counts we are seeing

533
00:22:54,190 --> 00:23:01,559
some effect perhaps of clover reducing

534
00:22:57,519 --> 00:23:04,599
stem density in certain certain cases

535
00:23:01,559 --> 00:23:07,279
but we'll look at how that's affecting

536
00:23:04,599 --> 00:23:09,740
yield in a couple of slides

537
00:23:07,279 --> 00:23:12,649
terms of crop biomass we did find that

538
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:14,599
the perennials uh do produce quite a

539
00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:16,788
large amount of crop biomass and since

540
00:23:14,599 --> 00:23:18,980
they phenology is different they are

541
00:23:16,788 --> 00:23:21,619
green later into the season that might

542
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:27,740
be an avenue for a dual purpose forage

543
00:23:21,619 --> 00:23:29,869
and grain crop we also did see that

544
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:32,058
Kearns that maintained this biomass

545
00:23:29,869 --> 00:23:34,189
production across both years while rye

546
00:23:32,058 --> 00:23:37,279
which was extremely productive in the

547
00:23:34,190 --> 00:23:43,509
first year again not persistent enough

548
00:23:37,279 --> 00:23:47,168
for crop system and then grain yields

549
00:23:43,509 --> 00:23:49,609
what many people are interested in

550
00:23:47,169 --> 00:23:52,630
significantly lower yields for the

551
00:23:49,609 --> 00:23:56,000
perennials compared to the annuals and

552
00:23:52,630 --> 00:23:58,370
in turns oh we're seeing a decline of

553
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,558
about fifty percent in that at second

554
00:23:58,369 --> 00:24:03,319
year and rye we weren't able to harvest

555
00:24:00,558 --> 00:24:07,129
anything we did notice however the the

556
00:24:03,319 --> 00:24:09,829
benefit of of clover in the grain in

557
00:24:07,130 --> 00:24:11,690
particular for the annuals in this

558
00:24:09,829 --> 00:24:17,329
second year so that seems to be a

559
00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:19,730
nitrogen effect so to summarize these

560
00:24:17,329 --> 00:24:21,529
agronomic results we really need to

561
00:24:19,730 --> 00:24:23,450
address the per any allottee of a swan

562
00:24:21,529 --> 00:24:25,908
or it won't be an effective part of a

563
00:24:23,450 --> 00:24:29,419
perennial cropping system interceding

564
00:24:25,909 --> 00:24:32,750
red clovers seem to be a benefit to the

565
00:24:29,419 --> 00:24:35,120
system use of the perennials to produce

566
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:37,548
forage might be part of making these

567
00:24:35,119 --> 00:24:39,519
more economically viable and we will be

568
00:24:37,548 --> 00:24:43,579
doing grain and forage quality a

569
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:44,929
assessment and then yield improvements

570
00:24:43,579 --> 00:24:46,699
through breeding and cropping system

571
00:24:44,929 --> 00:24:49,820
optimization are necessary in order for

572
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:51,769
these to compete with annuals in terms

573
00:24:49,819 --> 00:24:55,569
of productivity if we want to actually

574
00:24:51,769 --> 00:24:55,569
achieve those food security goals

575
00:24:56,058 --> 00:25:03,210
terms of understanding pest dynamics

576
00:25:00,589 --> 00:25:05,490
we looked at we'd comp community

577
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:07,950
composition based on those same biomass

578
00:25:05,490 --> 00:25:11,009
samples taken in twice I'm teen and 2018

579
00:25:07,950 --> 00:25:12,840
weeds were sorted by species dried and

580
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:15,150
weighed and then in collaboration with

581
00:25:12,839 --> 00:25:17,730
Mike Fulcher in the Bergstrom lab we

582
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:20,700
scouted for disease and took disease

583
00:25:17,730 --> 00:25:24,240
samples in 2017 and 2018 cultured those

584
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:30,059
in the lab and also looked at effects on

585
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:33,839
grain quality from fungal pathogens in

586
00:25:30,059 --> 00:25:35,940
terms of weed biomass we did see low

587
00:25:33,839 --> 00:25:38,250
weed biomass in the wheat and rye in the

588
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:40,710
first year and tended to be an increase

589
00:25:38,250 --> 00:25:48,329
in in weed biomass from year one tier

590
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:51,079
two in in rye the the weed biomass

591
00:25:48,329 --> 00:25:53,669
increased dramatically and Kern's it in

592
00:25:51,079 --> 00:25:57,329
no significant difference in weeds from

593
00:25:53,670 --> 00:26:00,930
year one to year two but it was quite a

594
00:25:57,329 --> 00:26:02,970
bit there we also did see a suppressive

595
00:26:00,930 --> 00:26:04,980
effect of clover and actually one thing

596
00:26:02,970 --> 00:26:07,650
you're seeing with these is that if you

597
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:12,019
added the clover biomass back in a total

598
00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:15,120
non grain biomass of the crops would be

599
00:26:12,019 --> 00:26:16,829
higher than it than it looks here so the

600
00:26:15,119 --> 00:26:18,199
competitive effect of the clover in the

601
00:26:16,829 --> 00:26:20,939
rise actually what we believe

602
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:26,039
contributed to the extremely low stand

603
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:28,110
density there we also have done a

604
00:26:26,039 --> 00:26:31,109
community ordination so I'll spend a

605
00:26:28,109 --> 00:26:33,269
little time explaining this this is a

606
00:26:31,109 --> 00:26:37,639
way to visualize the difference between

607
00:26:33,269 --> 00:26:43,049
different communities of plants by

608
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:48,480
extrapolating the statistical difference

609
00:26:43,049 --> 00:26:51,990
between abundance and and of different

610
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:54,180
plants in different samples so how to

611
00:26:51,990 --> 00:26:56,370
interpret this is that we have our grain

612
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:58,680
crops barley being the square Kern's of

613
00:26:56,369 --> 00:27:00,629
the circle is one rye the triangle and

614
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:03,990
wheat as the diamond and those are

615
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:07,710
plotted for each plot and then we also

616
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:09,660
have the weed species codes showing the

617
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:12,990
similarity or the likelihood that that

618
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:14,269
weed species is relative to that plot in

619
00:27:12,990 --> 00:27:16,609
terms of distance

620
00:27:14,269 --> 00:27:19,279
so the closer a weed species code is to

621
00:27:16,609 --> 00:27:20,839
a certain plot the more likely it was to

622
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:23,569
be there and the more abundant it was

623
00:27:20,839 --> 00:27:25,669
within that pot we've also separated

624
00:27:23,569 --> 00:27:27,439
this between the first year which is

625
00:27:25,670 --> 00:27:29,269
these lighter colored shapes for the

626
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:31,789
plots in the second year which is the

627
00:27:29,269 --> 00:27:36,170
black shapes and we are seeing a

628
00:27:31,789 --> 00:27:38,869
separation between those so there were

629
00:27:36,170 --> 00:27:40,400
more species and more annual species in

630
00:27:38,869 --> 00:27:45,319
the first year compared to the second

631
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:47,929
year and then looking at these ellipses

632
00:27:45,319 --> 00:27:51,200
that indicate the the confidence

633
00:27:47,929 --> 00:27:54,410
interval of each crop year interaction

634
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:56,210
we have we have the first year of wheat

635
00:27:54,410 --> 00:27:57,740
the first year of barley the first year

636
00:27:56,210 --> 00:28:00,500
of rye and the first year of Kearns ax

637
00:27:57,740 --> 00:28:03,289
and so they are overlapping quite a bit

638
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:05,000
down here in the second year we did see

639
00:28:03,289 --> 00:28:07,009
that the annuals were starting to

640
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:09,650
separate more from the perennials and

641
00:28:07,009 --> 00:28:14,029
what species were president in those

642
00:28:09,650 --> 00:28:16,490
plots and their abundance there so just

643
00:28:14,029 --> 00:28:19,279
to highlight which is which so you can

644
00:28:16,490 --> 00:28:22,099
compare the green as Kearns oh the red

645
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:29,299
is rye the yellow and brown is wheat and

646
00:28:22,099 --> 00:28:32,178
the blue is barley or disease working

647
00:28:29,299 --> 00:28:35,329
with Mike we observed a number of

648
00:28:32,179 --> 00:28:38,600
pathogens in ace one and Kern's ax in

649
00:28:35,329 --> 00:28:40,369
particular many in in Kern's ax this is

650
00:28:38,599 --> 00:28:43,459
it quite a laundry list for a single

651
00:28:40,369 --> 00:28:47,058
year's worth pathogens and we even found

652
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:49,460
one pathogen thar spot which is most

653
00:28:47,058 --> 00:28:51,889
common in corn not really been seen in

654
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:53,600
small grains so there there could be an

655
00:28:51,890 --> 00:28:55,040
even a higher diversity of pathogens to

656
00:28:53,599 --> 00:28:58,699
be worried about with some of these

657
00:28:55,039 --> 00:29:01,490
perennials we did find that there were

658
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:04,250
relatively high vomitoxin levels and

659
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:05,539
some of the grains so this is a concern

660
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:08,690
and an issue that needs to be addressed

661
00:29:05,539 --> 00:29:11,299
the USDA recommendation for vomitoxin is

662
00:29:08,690 --> 00:29:14,509
one part per million so in both cases we

663
00:29:11,299 --> 00:29:19,229
were above that on average

664
00:29:14,509 --> 00:29:20,098
so to summarize perennial grasses and

665
00:29:19,229 --> 00:29:22,619
certain rosamma

666
00:29:20,098 --> 00:29:24,329
this dicots are likely to dominate our

667
00:29:22,618 --> 00:29:27,358
perennial systems and we were seeing

668
00:29:24,329 --> 00:29:30,089
that in the second year of our weed

669
00:29:27,358 --> 00:29:32,968
assessment in particular clover can

670
00:29:30,089 --> 00:29:34,918
provide weed suppression the weed

671
00:29:32,969 --> 00:29:36,840
control during the establishment year is

672
00:29:34,919 --> 00:29:39,869
what we believe to be critical you have

673
00:29:36,839 --> 00:29:41,459
seen with some perennials that if they

674
00:29:39,868 --> 00:29:43,378
if they get off the ground and become

675
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:45,869
competitive close the canopy that we has

676
00:29:43,378 --> 00:29:48,088
really aren't a problem there perhaps

677
00:29:45,868 --> 00:29:50,519
even with rye one thing we're

678
00:29:48,088 --> 00:29:52,918
considering is post harvest weed control

679
00:29:50,519 --> 00:29:54,808
we noticed that after harvesting the Rye

680
00:29:52,919 --> 00:29:57,659
in the first year that other species

681
00:29:54,808 --> 00:29:59,428
came right into that space and without

682
00:29:57,659 --> 00:30:03,210
any control in the fall it may not have

683
00:29:59,429 --> 00:30:04,798
been able to store enough resources to

684
00:30:03,210 --> 00:30:07,798
overwinter successfully so we'll be

685
00:30:04,798 --> 00:30:10,138
looking at that in the future we have

686
00:30:07,798 --> 00:30:12,179
looked at many pathogens and we've seen

687
00:30:10,138 --> 00:30:16,079
some fungal contamination are there

688
00:30:12,179 --> 00:30:18,028
impacts on on grain yield something to

689
00:30:16,079 --> 00:30:19,888
be looked into the future the vomitoxin

690
00:30:18,028 --> 00:30:22,019
contamination is concerning and

691
00:30:19,888 --> 00:30:24,058
developing integrated pest management

692
00:30:22,019 --> 00:30:27,118
strategies for use in perennial grain

693
00:30:24,058 --> 00:30:29,219
systems where certain tech crop rotation

694
00:30:27,118 --> 00:30:30,838
cultivation are not available should be

695
00:30:29,219 --> 00:30:35,369
a priority in order to make these

696
00:30:30,838 --> 00:30:42,210
effective systems in terms of soil

697
00:30:35,368 --> 00:30:44,128
health we sampled in three years just

698
00:30:42,210 --> 00:30:48,028
after planting and then just after

699
00:30:44,128 --> 00:30:51,118
harvest in 2017 and 2018 took aggregate

700
00:30:48,028 --> 00:30:54,298
soil cores from each plot and retained

701
00:30:51,118 --> 00:30:58,468
about a kilogram for analysis calculated

702
00:30:54,298 --> 00:31:00,569
bulk density used LICO for nitrogen and

703
00:30:58,469 --> 00:31:03,570
carbon analysis and did permanganate

704
00:31:00,569 --> 00:31:05,999
oxidizable carbon soil respiration and

705
00:31:03,569 --> 00:31:10,439
aggregate wet aggregate stability in the

706
00:31:05,999 --> 00:31:14,249
Cornell soil health lab don't have any

707
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:16,409
data on that to present at this time but

708
00:31:14,249 --> 00:31:18,598
the in the literature ferns that has

709
00:31:16,409 --> 00:31:22,649
been shown to improve indicators of soil

710
00:31:18,598 --> 00:31:25,739
health but not necessarily storm or soil

711
00:31:22,648 --> 00:31:28,049
carbon than than wheat over a period of

712
00:31:25,739 --> 00:31:29,579
four years in 29

713
00:31:28,049 --> 00:31:31,710
tene we're gonna conclude our soil

714
00:31:29,579 --> 00:31:33,809
sampling by doing a depth stratified

715
00:31:31,710 --> 00:31:37,170
sampling to maybe take a closer look at

716
00:31:33,809 --> 00:31:38,849
the soil carbon dynamics we'll be doing

717
00:31:37,170 --> 00:31:43,440
some field measurements of Road ability

718
00:31:38,849 --> 00:31:45,869
with rainfall simulators and universal

719
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:47,820
soil loss equation modeling to determine

720
00:31:45,869 --> 00:31:49,919
the difference between the treneil and

721
00:31:47,819 --> 00:31:53,059
annuals I do have these two pictures

722
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:57,539
which were taken at Musgrave in April of

723
00:31:53,059 --> 00:32:00,539
2017 showing after a 2 inch rainfall

724
00:31:57,539 --> 00:32:02,519
event and a span about three hours some

725
00:32:00,539 --> 00:32:07,099
gully erosion that occurred in an

726
00:32:02,519 --> 00:32:10,500
adjacent wheat field and little to no

727
00:32:07,099 --> 00:32:12,259
evidence of significant erosion and the

728
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:15,900
currents of field right next to it and

729
00:32:12,259 --> 00:32:18,900
for a sense of scale the surveying pens

730
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:21,509
about a foot long so there was six to

731
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:23,160
eight inches of soil loss in this field

732
00:32:21,509 --> 00:32:25,710
and that one rain event and with the

733
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:28,140
intensity of these types of extreme

734
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:30,720
weather events the frequency intensity

735
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:34,259
of them increasing this is a major

736
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:41,750
concern and a major benefit of perennial

737
00:32:34,259 --> 00:32:44,549
crops for the economic analysis we did

738
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:46,380
we're planning on doing full enterprise

739
00:32:44,549 --> 00:32:48,659
budgets for but for the purpose of this

740
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:53,130
presentation was only able to get two

741
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:55,470
partial budgets so the benefits are the

742
00:32:53,130 --> 00:32:59,640
variables that were considering include

743
00:32:55,470 --> 00:33:01,950
Field Operations land rental prices seed

744
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:04,500
fertilizer and then the production of

745
00:33:01,950 --> 00:33:07,200
grain and and biomass for forage or

746
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:11,460
straw we will be conducting sensitivity

747
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:14,279
analysis to look closer at the yield

748
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:17,100
over time using that present value to

749
00:33:14,279 --> 00:33:18,809
estimate the break-even point of these

750
00:33:17,099 --> 00:33:21,269
perennial crops in terms of how long

751
00:33:18,809 --> 00:33:23,399
they're in the ground we will look at

752
00:33:21,269 --> 00:33:25,109
weather price premiums for perennial

753
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:29,540
products how that influences the

754
00:33:25,109 --> 00:33:32,059
economics of it and what if the

755
00:33:29,539 --> 00:33:34,319
increases to yield of perennials that's

756
00:33:32,059 --> 00:33:36,750
coming down the pipeline in terms of

757
00:33:34,319 --> 00:33:39,629
breeding or even optimization of our

758
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:41,059
cropping systems can can play a role

759
00:33:39,630 --> 00:33:43,040
there as well

760
00:33:41,059 --> 00:33:45,289
so just for our preliminary results with

761
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:47,990
the partial budgets what we did was we

762
00:33:45,289 --> 00:33:49,970
compared Kern's and ace one so we in

763
00:33:47,990 --> 00:33:53,650
terms of the the costs and then the

764
00:33:49,970 --> 00:33:58,519
receipts from each system and then we

765
00:33:53,650 --> 00:34:03,740
looked for a total revenue and then used

766
00:33:58,519 --> 00:34:05,779
a goal seeking algorithm to come

767
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:07,849
chain basically change the prices that

768
00:34:05,779 --> 00:34:09,440
we were putting in for Kern's ax and Ace

769
00:34:07,849 --> 00:34:11,150
one until they matched the revenue

770
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:13,519
available from week to get that

771
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:16,250
break-even price and so you can see some

772
00:34:13,519 --> 00:34:19,550
of the costs are different in particular

773
00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:21,590
the tillage and planting and seed costs

774
00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:23,300
in the years after that first

775
00:34:21,590 --> 00:34:27,620
establishment year for the perennials

776
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:29,390
and that could be a piece of changing

777
00:34:27,619 --> 00:34:32,569
the the profit margins on these

778
00:34:29,389 --> 00:34:36,589
perennial grants compared to annuals so

779
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:38,059
what would be fine very high prices for

780
00:34:36,590 --> 00:34:40,370
the perennials at this point you to

781
00:34:38,059 --> 00:34:44,509
those low yields three dollars a

782
00:34:40,369 --> 00:34:47,289
kilogram is very high I will say it for

783
00:34:44,510 --> 00:34:49,700
Kern's although when Patagonia was

784
00:34:47,289 --> 00:34:51,648
sourcing the Kern's ofor their initial

785
00:34:49,699 --> 00:34:53,869
long root L product they were paying

786
00:34:51,648 --> 00:34:56,569
over $1 a pound for Kearns ax for that

787
00:34:53,869 --> 00:34:58,190
so this isn't too far off of what

788
00:34:56,570 --> 00:35:01,190
somebody actually paid for these

789
00:34:58,190 --> 00:35:05,090
products in terms of getting it into

790
00:35:01,190 --> 00:35:09,470
their their their their prep their

791
00:35:05,090 --> 00:35:11,990
processing in terms of running a few

792
00:35:09,469 --> 00:35:14,449
sensitivity analyses this was done to

793
00:35:11,989 --> 00:35:19,369
see what yield Kearns and rye would need

794
00:35:14,449 --> 00:35:21,559
to produce if they were valued at the

795
00:35:19,369 --> 00:35:23,929
same price as organic winter wheat and

796
00:35:21,559 --> 00:35:25,400
we're seeing that the the yields are a

797
00:35:23,929 --> 00:35:27,980
little bit lower than what you would

798
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:32,960
expect from typical organic wheat field

799
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:34,909
about four thousand kilograms and the

800
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:38,510
prices do decrease if you assume that

801
00:35:34,909 --> 00:35:42,049
the perennial yields stay steady over

802
00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:43,700
time future work will include expanding

803
00:35:42,050 --> 00:35:49,039
these two full enterprise budgets to

804
00:35:43,699 --> 00:35:50,480
look more at the margins and then more

805
00:35:49,039 --> 00:35:52,699
modeling and research into the food

806
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:54,420
value chain of where these crops will be

807
00:35:52,699 --> 00:35:57,769
produced process

808
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:59,960
and then sent to market

809
00:35:57,769 --> 00:36:01,730
our last objective looking at

810
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:04,990
system-wide environmental sustainability

811
00:36:01,730 --> 00:36:07,730
we'll be using two different analyses

812
00:36:04,989 --> 00:36:10,939
the first is emerge-ii or embodied

813
00:36:07,730 --> 00:36:14,240
energy which looks at all of the inputs

814
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:16,730
to a system including natural resources

815
00:36:14,239 --> 00:36:19,069
such as solar radiation rainfall wind

816
00:36:16,730 --> 00:36:22,900
energy for pollination and the soil

817
00:36:19,070 --> 00:36:25,610
that's supporting the system and then

818
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:27,500
transforms all those values into a a

819
00:36:25,610 --> 00:36:30,829
common unit for comparison across

820
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:33,050
systems and calculates to certain

821
00:36:30,829 --> 00:36:35,869
sustainability indices based on the

822
00:36:33,050 --> 00:36:37,550
ratio of renewable resources to

823
00:36:35,869 --> 00:36:39,980
non-renewable resources that are used

824
00:36:37,550 --> 00:36:42,140
therein we'll also be using the farm

825
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:44,780
energy analysis tool which is a static

826
00:36:42,139 --> 00:36:47,329
model that was developed to estimate

827
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:50,810
greenhouse gas emissions and fuel usage

828
00:36:47,329 --> 00:36:53,929
within farming systems and that's based

829
00:36:50,809 --> 00:36:56,929
on parameters such as type of tillage

830
00:36:53,929 --> 00:36:59,389
the crop area and yield residue

831
00:36:56,929 --> 00:37:01,309
management and removal and some certain

832
00:36:59,389 --> 00:37:04,960
inputs such as fertilizer rate seeding

833
00:37:01,309 --> 00:37:04,960
rate pesticides and fuel consumption

834
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:10,580
just to wrap up I will mention a couple

835
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:12,410
of our other projects that are going on

836
00:37:10,579 --> 00:37:14,179
that aren't necessarily going to be into

837
00:37:12,409 --> 00:37:16,368
my thesis we are looking at

838
00:37:14,179 --> 00:37:18,230
intercropping peas with these these

839
00:37:16,369 --> 00:37:21,710
grains and also looking at other

840
00:37:18,230 --> 00:37:25,240
agronomic factors such as nurse crops

841
00:37:21,710 --> 00:37:28,699
and row spacing and this in this project

842
00:37:25,239 --> 00:37:30,799
we are looking at how to renovate an

843
00:37:28,699 --> 00:37:35,299
older current and to try to stimulate

844
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:38,210
new reproductive growth and one way that

845
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:40,630
we thought about that is to use strip

846
00:37:38,210 --> 00:37:43,970
tillage for root zone disturbance and

847
00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:45,980
increase encourage increased tillering

848
00:37:43,969 --> 00:37:48,108
thereafter and this has shown some

849
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:51,769
promising preliminary results using fall

850
00:37:48,108 --> 00:37:53,179
strip tillage and then allowing it to

851
00:37:51,769 --> 00:37:54,969
regrow through the fallen into the

852
00:37:53,179 --> 00:37:57,579
spring

853
00:37:54,969 --> 00:37:59,289
and then finally looking at more closely

854
00:37:57,579 --> 00:38:02,349
at the yield components of Kern zone

855
00:37:59,289 --> 00:38:06,880
it's a multi-site project here Minnesota

856
00:38:02,349 --> 00:38:08,559
Wisconsin and Kansas to understand the

857
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:10,780
development of the crop in different

858
00:38:08,559 --> 00:38:13,469
climates and different regions and

859
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:16,000
relate that back to more important

860
00:38:13,469 --> 00:38:22,209
agronomic considerations such as harvest

861
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:24,789
timing and processing so like to

862
00:38:22,210 --> 00:38:26,050
acknowledge many many people that have

863
00:38:24,789 --> 00:38:28,480
contributed to this work and

864
00:38:26,050 --> 00:38:30,610
particularly my committee members 20

865
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:32,889
ditomasso Matt Ryan and Miguel Gomez in

866
00:38:30,610 --> 00:38:34,210
applied economics and management all of

867
00:38:32,889 --> 00:38:36,279
the lab members of the sustainable

868
00:38:34,210 --> 00:38:38,980
cropping systems and weed ecology and

869
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:41,530
management labs many undergraduate

870
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:45,429
research assistants are farmer advisory

871
00:38:41,530 --> 00:38:48,910
board and many external collaborators in

872
00:38:45,429 --> 00:38:54,349
particular with the Kern's of projects

873
00:38:48,909 --> 00:39:01,199
oh I think that's the wrong photo Thanks

874
00:38:54,349 --> 00:39:01,199
[Applause]

875
00:39:04,619 --> 00:39:10,809
with respect to the difficulty of

876
00:39:07,269 --> 00:39:13,509
establishing tons of is that because the

877
00:39:10,809 --> 00:39:18,369
seed viability is low or is it because

878
00:39:13,510 --> 00:39:21,400
of some party dormancy or bigger well

879
00:39:18,369 --> 00:39:24,279
since it's a very small seed relative to

880
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:26,769
our annuals it just takes a little bit

881
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:29,769
longer to get going in the fall it

882
00:39:26,769 --> 00:39:32,860
doesn't grow as rapidly it doesn't have

883
00:39:29,769 --> 00:39:35,800
the energy resources to do so and I

884
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:37,930
think in at musgrave part of our problem

885
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:40,300
is not unlike we're learning how to grow

886
00:39:37,929 --> 00:39:41,889
these crops and things like seed

887
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:43,690
placement can be very important for a

888
00:39:41,889 --> 00:39:45,849
smaller seeded species trying to target

889
00:39:43,690 --> 00:39:47,409
it a half inch seeding depth and maybe

890
00:39:45,849 --> 00:39:49,089
getting a little bit not having the

891
00:39:47,409 --> 00:39:51,690
precision to place it right with some of

892
00:39:49,090 --> 00:39:55,059
the equipment we're using there's also

893
00:39:51,690 --> 00:39:56,530
some factor of soil moisture content and

894
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:57,820
how that could affect so it's a little

895
00:39:56,530 --> 00:40:03,160
bit more sensitive to some of these

896
00:39:57,820 --> 00:40:05,140
these variables so finding a way to and

897
00:40:03,159 --> 00:40:07,599
it might involve seeding rate it might

898
00:40:05,139 --> 00:40:10,659
involve not fertilizing in the fall

899
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:12,369
which some people have in currents of

900
00:40:10,659 --> 00:40:14,139
research have shown to really just feed

901
00:40:12,369 --> 00:40:16,119
the weeds the Kearns is not able to

902
00:40:14,139 --> 00:40:17,920
uptake it it hasn't developed it's its

903
00:40:16,119 --> 00:40:21,069
root system extensively enough to

904
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:24,760
fertilize to take fertilizer in that

905
00:40:21,070 --> 00:40:26,380
first fall after planting working

906
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:28,600
through a lot of those questions will

907
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:31,030
probably contribute to enhanced

908
00:40:28,599 --> 00:40:33,130
establishment and then we had control in

909
00:40:31,030 --> 00:40:35,170
that period as well whether through

910
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:37,360
cultivation by planting in rows and then

911
00:40:35,170 --> 00:40:40,090
cultivating in that first period before

912
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:42,190
it's able to spread into the rows or

913
00:40:40,090 --> 00:40:43,960
using chemical methods for weed control

914
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:46,360
until it gets off the ground in the

915
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:49,619
following spring are some options that

916
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:49,620
we'll probably have to look at

917
00:40:50,190 --> 00:41:03,119
Chuck mentioned the high vomitoxin

918
00:40:56,139 --> 00:41:09,699
levels and I know some armored man shall

919
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:12,299
walk toxin levels but throughout a seat

920
00:41:09,699 --> 00:41:17,889
thing mm-hmm and I wanted to take you

921
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:20,620
those levels were before around her so

922
00:41:17,889 --> 00:41:22,079
those have not been cleaned and and

923
00:41:20,619 --> 00:41:23,859
that's something that we've been

924
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:27,549
considering as whether there are

925
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:30,970
economic ways to remove the

926
00:41:27,550 --> 00:41:36,070
contamination another way is to simply

927
00:41:30,969 --> 00:41:37,539
blend with an other seed and I didn't

928
00:41:36,070 --> 00:41:39,220
mention it with Kearns uh because some

929
00:41:37,539 --> 00:41:41,920
some it's making practice properties it

930
00:41:39,219 --> 00:41:45,939
is being used in in blend flour blends

931
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:47,920
for baking so it might not be as much of

932
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:51,039
a barrier but it's definitely something

933
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:53,380
that needs to be understood and managed

934
00:41:51,039 --> 00:41:56,099
better it ideally there wouldn't be that

935
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:56,099
contamination

936
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:09,279
[Music]

937
00:42:13,498 --> 00:42:20,649
yes so we are part of a group that has

938
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:23,229
been working on Kearns oh pretty closely

939
00:42:20,650 --> 00:42:26,019
together and that involves both breeders

940
00:42:23,228 --> 00:42:28,659
agronomists even food science folks at

941
00:42:26,018 --> 00:42:29,889
the land Institute University of

942
00:42:28,659 --> 00:42:31,298
Minnesota University of

943
00:42:29,889 --> 00:42:34,690
wisconsin-madison

944
00:42:31,298 --> 00:42:39,788
University of Manitoba here

945
00:42:34,690 --> 00:42:41,019
Ohio State Iowa sorry Lyon in France so

946
00:42:39,789 --> 00:42:42,880
there's there's an extensive research

947
00:42:41,018 --> 00:42:44,409
Network around Kern's right now and the

948
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:46,900
main breeding efforts are happening at

949
00:42:44,409 --> 00:42:50,920
the Land Institute Minnesota and

950
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:53,170
Manitoba and they are we're using what

951
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:55,838
they call cycle four Kearns ax in these

952
00:42:53,170 --> 00:42:58,298
projects and the land Institute's now on

953
00:42:55,838 --> 00:43:00,400
cycle eight and they're seeing 20%

954
00:42:58,298 --> 00:43:02,768
averaging twenty percent yield increases

955
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:05,139
across those cycles so there has been

956
00:43:02,768 --> 00:43:07,358
quite a lot of advancement in that and

957
00:43:05,139 --> 00:43:11,228
it's even accelerating due to the use of

958
00:43:07,358 --> 00:43:14,768
genomic selection rather than more

959
00:43:11,228 --> 00:43:16,389
traditional phenotypic selection you can

960
00:43:14,768 --> 00:43:17,949
imagine with a perennial where you might

961
00:43:16,389 --> 00:43:20,139
need to grow it for five years in order

962
00:43:17,949 --> 00:43:22,929
to actually phenotype it correctly that

963
00:43:20,139 --> 00:43:24,759
that's a barrier to rapid breeding but

964
00:43:22,929 --> 00:43:27,068
with with genomics they're accelerating

965
00:43:24,759 --> 00:43:29,650
that process so the short answer is that

966
00:43:27,068 --> 00:43:32,108
yes we're in contact with them we're

967
00:43:29,650 --> 00:43:35,680
getting new varieties and seed we just

968
00:43:32,108 --> 00:43:37,690
planted six new varieties at Caldwell

969
00:43:35,679 --> 00:43:39,728
field this fall and we'll be evaluating

970
00:43:37,690 --> 00:43:41,769
those varieties for the the north

971
00:43:39,728 --> 00:43:45,038
eastern climate in collaboration with

972
00:43:41,768 --> 00:43:48,368
others and hopefully that that will be a

973
00:43:45,039 --> 00:43:52,049
big part in the progress of perennials

974
00:43:48,369 --> 00:43:54,099
and making them a viable cropping system

975
00:43:52,048 --> 00:43:56,079
so you mentioned the cruiser was

976
00:43:54,099 --> 00:43:58,119
originally started at Rodale and then

977
00:43:56,079 --> 00:44:01,509
moved to the land and those are real

978
00:43:58,119 --> 00:44:03,519
different climates and soils the new

979
00:44:01,509 --> 00:44:06,009
varieties have been selection pressure

980
00:44:03,518 --> 00:44:08,068
during debriding development at any of

981
00:44:06,009 --> 00:44:08,068
the

982
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:13,940
well that's what we're hoping to

983
00:44:11,559 --> 00:44:15,920
discover with these new lines that we

984
00:44:13,940 --> 00:44:19,579
receive this fall so we're we got four

985
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:21,349
lines from Minnesota and those are four

986
00:44:19,579 --> 00:44:23,000
we would expect there would be some

987
00:44:21,349 --> 00:44:25,639
difference based based on the the

988
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:27,289
selection in different climates so we'll

989
00:44:25,639 --> 00:44:29,389
be comparing those with some of the land

990
00:44:27,289 --> 00:44:33,099
institute varieties at the same time and

991
00:44:29,389 --> 00:44:33,099
then seeing what comes out of that

992
00:44:35,650 --> 00:44:41,869
yeah they've got lines that they're

993
00:44:39,550 --> 00:44:43,809
going to have their own varieties pretty

994
00:44:41,869 --> 00:44:46,808
soon

995
00:44:43,809 --> 00:44:46,809
yeah

996
00:44:47,239 --> 00:44:52,368
so you're comparing the perennial crops

997
00:44:49,460 --> 00:44:56,389
with sounds like an organic annual crop

998
00:44:52,369 --> 00:44:58,608
system in each case can you just say a

999
00:44:56,389 --> 00:45:00,318
little bit more about that for what

1000
00:44:58,608 --> 00:45:00,858
you're comparing it to and how you chose

1001
00:45:00,318 --> 00:45:03,798
that

1002
00:45:00,858 --> 00:45:08,420
so why organic you know what kind of

1003
00:45:03,798 --> 00:45:10,309
rotation that says yeah so we we chose

1004
00:45:08,420 --> 00:45:15,980
to compare two organic small grains

1005
00:45:10,309 --> 00:45:18,290
because currently there aren't aren't

1006
00:45:15,980 --> 00:45:20,179
chemical weed controls or pesticides

1007
00:45:18,289 --> 00:45:21,769
that are labeled in in kearns our

1008
00:45:20,179 --> 00:45:22,848
perennial rye so we thought that would

1009
00:45:21,769 --> 00:45:28,369
be a good starting point

1010
00:45:22,849 --> 00:45:30,619
also Patagonia is 100% organic General

1011
00:45:28,369 --> 00:45:32,750
Mills Cascadian farms is an organic line

1012
00:45:30,619 --> 00:45:34,369
but their broader product line is not

1013
00:45:32,750 --> 00:45:36,619
and they actually are very interested in

1014
00:45:34,369 --> 00:45:40,220
conventional production just to increase

1015
00:45:36,619 --> 00:45:43,670
the scale that would be for them to get

1016
00:45:40,219 --> 00:45:46,969
enough grain for their products so that

1017
00:45:43,670 --> 00:45:48,380
that that was in that influenced our our

1018
00:45:46,969 --> 00:45:49,699
decision there were also the sustainable

1019
00:45:48,380 --> 00:45:53,358
cropping systems lab and a lot of our

1020
00:45:49,699 --> 00:45:57,348
work is into organic agriculture so

1021
00:45:53,358 --> 00:45:59,779
having some level of prior knowledge and

1022
00:45:57,349 --> 00:46:02,210
that was was a contributing factor there

1023
00:45:59,780 --> 00:46:05,359
but definitely looking into conventional

1024
00:46:02,210 --> 00:46:07,730
going forward is something that would be

1025
00:46:05,358 --> 00:46:11,779
needed to have this be as widespread as

1026
00:46:07,730 --> 00:46:13,849
it could be in terms of rotation we

1027
00:46:11,780 --> 00:46:16,339
realize that there is some artificiality

1028
00:46:13,849 --> 00:46:18,109
we're growing we after we after we in

1029
00:46:16,338 --> 00:46:19,818
the same plots you know in our

1030
00:46:18,108 --> 00:46:25,098
comparison so there's going to be in

1031
00:46:19,818 --> 00:46:26,989
effect there it's it's hard to so there

1032
00:46:25,099 --> 00:46:28,880
wasn't there was no rotation within this

1033
00:46:26,989 --> 00:46:30,078
this experiment in particular and we

1034
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:31,730
think that there might have been some

1035
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:33,740
disease buildup in in the wheat and

1036
00:46:31,730 --> 00:46:37,818
barley into the second year so that is

1037
00:46:33,739 --> 00:46:41,568
sort of a confounding effect but it's

1038
00:46:37,818 --> 00:46:46,579
without having massive experiments it's

1039
00:46:41,568 --> 00:46:48,710
hard to have enough variables to control

1040
00:46:46,579 --> 00:46:53,119
for everything that eat that you want to

1041
00:46:48,710 --> 00:46:55,329
so it was sort of a simplicity decision

1042
00:46:53,119 --> 00:46:55,329
there

1043
00:46:55,650 --> 00:47:00,099
Tony the Java question you answered it

1044
00:46:58,150 --> 00:47:02,680
was basically the road that you keep

1045
00:47:00,099 --> 00:47:04,179
returns in conventional systems and what

1046
00:47:02,679 --> 00:47:08,589
have you heard from growers are eight

1047
00:47:04,179 --> 00:47:10,210
open to money changers there's there's a

1048
00:47:08,590 --> 00:47:12,490
lot of people that are interested I

1049
00:47:10,210 --> 00:47:13,809
would say in terms of growers that are

1050
00:47:12,489 --> 00:47:15,009
looking to adopt some of these crafts

1051
00:47:13,809 --> 00:47:16,929
that's they might be a little bit too

1052
00:47:15,010 --> 00:47:20,350
early at this point there's there's

1053
00:47:16,929 --> 00:47:22,359
still work that needs to be done on the

1054
00:47:20,349 --> 00:47:25,239
other hand there is the the demand from

1055
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:26,590
the food industry to have grain to work

1056
00:47:25,239 --> 00:47:28,929
with in their research and development

1057
00:47:26,590 --> 00:47:30,280
programs or even for I think Patagonia

1058
00:47:28,929 --> 00:47:32,349
is putting out a new currents of beer

1059
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:35,740
pretty soon they even want to expand to

1060
00:47:32,349 --> 00:47:37,509
the east coast so that that is a sort of

1061
00:47:35,739 --> 00:47:40,269
an interesting time to live in as like

1062
00:47:37,510 --> 00:47:41,560
well from a research perspective I don't

1063
00:47:40,269 --> 00:47:43,059
think that we've quite figured it out

1064
00:47:41,559 --> 00:47:44,590
and I don't want to recommend a farmer

1065
00:47:43,059 --> 00:47:47,170
try this and then have it fail in their

1066
00:47:44,590 --> 00:47:49,210
fields but if there's an economic

1067
00:47:47,170 --> 00:47:51,760
incentive because of a high demand for

1068
00:47:49,210 --> 00:48:01,300
the product then there's there's that

1069
00:47:51,760 --> 00:48:04,950
consideration as well is one right or

1070
00:48:01,300 --> 00:48:10,030
serving as habitat for beneficial

1071
00:48:04,949 --> 00:48:14,559
insects pathogen non-pathogenic other

1072
00:48:10,030 --> 00:48:16,300
types organisms so I actually don't know

1073
00:48:14,559 --> 00:48:21,039
if any one that's that's looked at that

1074
00:48:16,300 --> 00:48:23,289
I can go back to one of my slides to

1075
00:48:21,039 --> 00:48:25,869
point out just a pretty cool thing that

1076
00:48:23,289 --> 00:48:29,130
we saw in one of the fields is that

1077
00:48:25,869 --> 00:48:33,519
there's birds nesting in our kearns a--

1078
00:48:29,130 --> 00:48:34,720
in relation to actually a wild parsnip

1079
00:48:33,519 --> 00:48:37,300
plant so we didn't want to get too close

1080
00:48:34,719 --> 00:48:39,009
to it but but it is it this is sort of

1081
00:48:37,300 --> 00:48:41,380
showing that that potential for an

1082
00:48:39,010 --> 00:48:43,990
enhance wildlife habitat by having it in

1083
00:48:41,380 --> 00:48:46,119
the ground year-round I will say Ducks

1084
00:48:43,989 --> 00:48:49,089
Unlimited has been in talks with the

1085
00:48:46,119 --> 00:48:51,609
land Institute about perennial grains as

1086
00:48:49,090 --> 00:48:56,160
a way to increase the the habitat

1087
00:48:51,610 --> 00:48:58,780
potential of cropland so that is another

1088
00:48:56,159 --> 00:49:00,250
possible benefit of these systems but it

1089
00:48:58,780 --> 00:49:01,990
hasn't been looked at very closely as

1090
00:49:00,250 --> 00:49:05,710
far as I know I mean when you talk about

1091
00:49:01,989 --> 00:49:08,828
systems I think about not only the

1092
00:49:05,710 --> 00:49:11,619
impact of the particular crop growing

1093
00:49:08,829 --> 00:49:13,630
it's impact others yeah so I know it's

1094
00:49:11,619 --> 00:49:16,450
outside the scope of your experiment but

1095
00:49:13,630 --> 00:49:18,400
within a landscape for example if you

1096
00:49:16,449 --> 00:49:20,558
have so much proportion of these

1097
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:25,059
burnheal grains how much could they

1098
00:49:20,559 --> 00:49:28,170
affect positively the other annuals like

1099
00:49:25,059 --> 00:49:34,839
a growing area with respect to customs

1100
00:49:28,170 --> 00:49:35,950
so that's one my question here is do you

1101
00:49:34,838 --> 00:49:45,068
know anything about so that the

1102
00:49:35,949 --> 00:49:50,978
declining yield so the the theory is

1103
00:49:45,068 --> 00:49:53,650
that the life history of the plant is to

1104
00:49:50,978 --> 00:49:58,449
reproduce more seed when it's younger

1105
00:49:53,650 --> 00:49:59,559
and then as it ages trail off that part

1106
00:49:58,449 --> 00:50:00,879
of our reason for looking at strip

1107
00:49:59,559 --> 00:50:02,619
tillage is it could also be interest to

1108
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:04,900
Civic competition or signaling between

1109
00:50:02,619 --> 00:50:07,778
plants saying okay this space is full

1110
00:50:04,900 --> 00:50:10,088
now we're not going to produce as much

1111
00:50:07,778 --> 00:50:12,728
seed we're going to focus on developing

1112
00:50:10,088 --> 00:50:16,989
deeper root systems and and competitive

1113
00:50:12,728 --> 00:50:19,298
strategies like that so I think that it

1114
00:50:16,989 --> 00:50:22,690
could be a little bit of both it could

1115
00:50:19,298 --> 00:50:24,518
just be the lifecycle of the plan it

1116
00:50:22,690 --> 00:50:27,429
could be that that competitive effect

1117
00:50:24,518 --> 00:50:29,618
that's affecting it but if we can better

1118
00:50:27,429 --> 00:50:32,639
understand that and even manage it that

1119
00:50:29,619 --> 00:50:36,028
would contribute to a more persistent

1120
00:50:32,639 --> 00:50:36,028
stainable system

1121
00:50:38,528 --> 00:50:42,438
Christine I know you've been thinking a

1122
00:50:40,518 --> 00:50:44,208
lot about herbicide resistance which is

1123
00:50:42,438 --> 00:50:46,428
the big problem in annual crops do you

1124
00:50:44,208 --> 00:50:49,578
expect there to be a shift if there was

1125
00:50:46,429 --> 00:50:51,039
widespread adoption of perennial greens

1126
00:50:49,579 --> 00:50:54,318
do you think that would affect

1127
00:50:51,039 --> 00:50:56,119
resistance this is one of my personal

1128
00:50:54,318 --> 00:50:57,608
opinion but I've been thinking about a

1129
00:50:56,119 --> 00:51:01,278
little bit of how to incorporate

1130
00:50:57,608 --> 00:51:03,528
chemical weed control into perennial

1131
00:51:01,278 --> 00:51:05,298
systems and I actually think that there

1132
00:51:03,528 --> 00:51:08,179
could be some real benefits there as

1133
00:51:05,298 --> 00:51:10,009
well because of the idea that if they

1134
00:51:08,179 --> 00:51:11,599
get past establishment and established

1135
00:51:10,009 --> 00:51:14,778
well then they'll out-compete other

1136
00:51:11,599 --> 00:51:16,849
weeds so in the five-year projected

1137
00:51:14,778 --> 00:51:19,880
lifespan of occur in the field you could

1138
00:51:16,849 --> 00:51:22,249
spray once or twice in that first fall

1139
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:24,019
in spring to clean up the weeds that are

1140
00:51:22,248 --> 00:51:26,509
there and then for the next four years

1141
00:51:24,018 --> 00:51:28,848
not have to spray anything which you

1142
00:51:26,509 --> 00:51:31,130
could obviously you're reducing the

1143
00:51:28,849 --> 00:51:33,109
amount of product that's being applied

1144
00:51:31,130 --> 00:51:34,900
to the field and thus reducing Selective

1145
00:51:33,108 --> 00:51:39,828
pressure for herbicide tolerant weeds

1146
00:51:34,900 --> 00:51:41,269
and if we're going to be looking at the

1147
00:51:39,829 --> 00:51:43,609
seed bank and the spring it could have a

1148
00:51:41,268 --> 00:51:45,618
an effect on the seed bank if if other

1149
00:51:43,608 --> 00:51:48,438
seeds are from other weed species are

1150
00:51:45,619 --> 00:51:54,588
our fatal germinating underneath they're

1151
00:51:48,438 --> 00:51:56,298
fatally germinating so and not necessary

1152
00:51:54,588 --> 00:51:58,578
related to your question but in terms of

1153
00:51:56,298 --> 00:52:01,208
organic which it has been I think that

1154
00:51:58,579 --> 00:52:03,589
there's potential for certain farmers to

1155
00:52:01,208 --> 00:52:06,558
transition to organic using perennial

1156
00:52:03,588 --> 00:52:08,630
crops where you could use your sort of

1157
00:52:06,559 --> 00:52:09,979
final dose of herbicide and that

1158
00:52:08,630 --> 00:52:12,048
establishment and then the next four

1159
00:52:09,978 --> 00:52:13,278
years know herbicide application keep

1160
00:52:12,048 --> 00:52:16,159
your records and by the end of it

1161
00:52:13,278 --> 00:52:17,989
there's organic certification on the

1162
00:52:16,159 --> 00:52:21,078
line as well so I think there's

1163
00:52:17,989 --> 00:52:25,489
potential in those those areas too but I

1164
00:52:21,079 --> 00:52:29,539
do think that work on herbicide efficacy

1165
00:52:25,489 --> 00:52:32,719
and the the impact on the on the crops

1166
00:52:29,539 --> 00:52:35,569
finding viable herbicides would move

1167
00:52:32,719 --> 00:52:38,269
along a lot of perennial grain systems

1168
00:52:35,568 --> 00:52:41,108
conventional systems hasn't really been

1169
00:52:38,268 --> 00:52:41,108
done so far

00:52:44,210 --> 00:52:51,489
