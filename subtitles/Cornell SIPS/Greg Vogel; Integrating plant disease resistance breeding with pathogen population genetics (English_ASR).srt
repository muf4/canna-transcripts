1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:04,759
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:06,519 --> 00:00:10,839
University thank you so much Gary for

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:13,320
that very nice introduction and thank

4
00:00:10,839 --> 00:00:15,120
you to all of you for attending my talk

5
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:17,640
today I'm really excited to share a

6
00:00:15,119 --> 00:00:19,559
little bit about my research experience

7
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:22,000
and and thoughts I have going uh forward

8
00:00:19,559 --> 00:00:26,000
as a vegetable breeder at at Cornell uh

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:29,679
so I tried to tailor the talk more

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,320
uh for the pathology audience but I'd

11
00:00:29,678 --> 00:00:34,119
like to start just by giving an overview

12
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:36,079
of my current research program um so I'm

13
00:00:34,119 --> 00:00:38,039
a tomato and eggplant breeder here at

14
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:40,359
Cornell uh there are three kind of

15
00:00:38,039 --> 00:00:42,719
overarching objectives of my lab's

16
00:00:40,359 --> 00:00:45,159
research those are to gen discover the

17
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:47,879
genetic basis of traits of importance

18
00:00:45,159 --> 00:00:50,198
either to Growers or consumers to model

19
00:00:47,878 --> 00:00:51,920
strategies for for how to implement new

20
00:00:50,198 --> 00:00:54,519
technologies in the context of a very

21
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:56,640
applied cultivar development program and

22
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:58,600
then finally to develop and release

23
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,359
varieties of tomato and eggplant that

24
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:03,518
meet the needs of stakeholders in New

25
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:05,000
York and the Northeastern United States

26
00:01:03,518 --> 00:01:07,560
so I'll talk I'll talk a little bit more

27
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,879
about each of those objectives and keep

28
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:12,799
trying to Adventure slides with

29
00:01:09,879 --> 00:01:15,039
this so in terms of cultivar development

30
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:18,560
uh for New York in the Northeast uh they

31
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:20,680
are really diverse stakeholders markets

32
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:23,359
and needs in our region so talking about

33
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:25,840
tomato tomato is grown in open field

34
00:01:23,359 --> 00:01:28,359
it's grown in high tunnels uh also in

35
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:30,240
our state we have companies growing

36
00:01:28,359 --> 00:01:32,438
tomatoes and some of the most most

37
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:34,560
Hightech environments that tomatoes are

38
00:01:32,438 --> 00:01:36,398
grown in around the world this is green

39
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,920
Empire Farms outside of Syracuse where

40
00:01:36,399 --> 00:01:41,519
they grow tomatoes under 64 Acres of

41
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:43,960
glass tomatoes are grown for wholesale

42
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:46,359
markets uh including at produce auctions

43
00:01:43,959 --> 00:01:48,319
which is an imported uh outlet for many

44
00:01:46,359 --> 00:01:50,759
of the Amish medanite growers in our

45
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:53,118
region they're grown and sold directly

46
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:56,039
to Consumers at farmers markets and farm

47
00:01:53,118 --> 00:01:58,759
stands and through csas New York is also

48
00:01:56,039 --> 00:02:01,118
a state where over 90% of the population

49
00:01:58,759 --> 00:02:03,039
lives in urban environments there are a

50
00:02:01,118 --> 00:02:04,599
lot of people interested uh in growing

51
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:06,000
vegetables in these environments and

52
00:02:04,599 --> 00:02:07,798
there are a lot of needs to develop

53
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,719
varieties that that do well in those in

54
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:11,920
those distinct

55
00:02:09,719 --> 00:02:14,400
environments uh finally New York is a

56
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:17,119
very diverse State um and there are many

57
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,599
people uh uh in our state who are

58
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:21,400
interested in growing crops that are

59
00:02:18,598 --> 00:02:24,839
important to their Heritage and eggplant

60
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:26,480
is a really great uh species uh to meet

61
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:28,200
some of those needs U because there's so

62
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:30,039
many diverse types that people are are

63
00:02:28,199 --> 00:02:33,119
used to from around the world one of

64
00:02:30,039 --> 00:02:35,039
those types is the African EG or sanum

65
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:38,400
aop pum seen here that my life is

66
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:40,719
starting some research on as

67
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,439
well so I mentioned I'm interested in

68
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:44,598
testing how to implement new

69
00:02:42,439 --> 00:02:47,560
technologies in an applied vegetable

70
00:02:44,598 --> 00:02:48,679
cultivar development program and uh one

71
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:50,719
of the things that I'm really interested

72
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:52,239
in is genomic selection and if if you're

73
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:55,560
familiar with that genomic selection is

74
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:59,360
the idea of

75
00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:00,479
uh of combining genotypic and phenotypic

76
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,560
information

77
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:04,238
on what's called a training population

78
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,318
using that information to develop

79
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:08,319
statistical models and then applying

80
00:03:06,318 --> 00:03:09,679
those models to populations of plants

81
00:03:08,318 --> 00:03:12,000
for which we might not have any

82
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,719
phenotype information we might not ever

83
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,400
observed their phenotypes we can

84
00:03:13,719 --> 00:03:18,799
actually predict their phenotypes based

85
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:21,959
exclusively on markers this is a

86
00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:23,920
technology that's been implemented in uh

87
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:25,920
pretty widely in breeding programs for

88
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:28,199
agronomic crops over the past 10 years

89
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:30,438
or so but the adoption in vegetables has

90
00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:33,759
been a little bit slower for for many

91
00:03:30,438 --> 00:03:36,000
reasons um you know one I think traits

92
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:38,519
and vegetables are more difficult to

93
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,919
quantify um either because of the

94
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:41,680
throughput right we can't drive a

95
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:43,238
combine through a field and quantify

96
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,438
yield on thousands of plots we have to

97
00:03:43,239 --> 00:03:46,438
go out there and pick them multiple

98
00:03:44,438 --> 00:03:48,280
times through the season and also some

99
00:03:46,438 --> 00:03:49,680
traits are just more intangible and

100
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:51,360
difficult to turn into numbers so you

101
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,959
know really successful breeders can walk

102
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:55,680
through their field and Visually

103
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:57,280
identify plants that are superior in

104
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,000
terms of their growth habit their fruit

105
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,158
shape their color those are things that

106
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,799
are more challenging to quickly turn it

107
00:04:01,158 --> 00:04:04,719
into numbers but uh I'm really

108
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:06,438
interested in working with uh the

109
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:08,919
expertise we have here on campus to kind

110
00:04:06,438 --> 00:04:12,598
of showcase how we can uh Implement

111
00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:12,598
these Technologies in in a practical

112
00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:19,639
way uh finally uh genetic Discovery and

113
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:21,800
pre-breeding this this has been one of

114
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:26,000
the most important legacies of public

115
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:27,280
sector vegetable breeders um in tomato

116
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,639
you know if you go to the farmers market

117
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:33,159
and look at Tomatoes you'll see such a

118
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:35,879
iety of shapes and colors and sizes but

119
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:37,600
despite all that morphological diversity

120
00:04:35,879 --> 00:04:39,399
there's actually pretty limited genetic

121
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:42,199
diversity especially compared to what's

122
00:04:39,399 --> 00:04:46,478
found in uh the related species of

123
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:49,319
domesticated tomato in uh uh in in wild

124
00:04:46,478 --> 00:04:51,478
species abmic to South America uh plant

125
00:04:49,319 --> 00:04:54,120
breeders have introgressed you know so

126
00:04:51,478 --> 00:04:56,159
many genes of commercial importance from

127
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:58,720
these wild species into domesticated

128
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,439
tomato that if you look at commercially

129
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:02,360
available varieties coming out now and

130
00:05:00,439 --> 00:05:05,120
compare them it's commercially available

131
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:06,680
varieties coming out 50 or 75 years ago

132
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:09,038
the genetic diversity is much greater

133
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:11,199
because of how much wild species DNA has

134
00:05:09,038 --> 00:05:14,079
been introgressed into

135
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:17,240
tomato um one of the projects that my

136
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:19,918
lab is starting to work on is working

137
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:22,639
with sanum cities which is actually one

138
00:05:19,918 --> 00:05:26,318
of the most distantly related Allied

139
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:29,800
species of tomato it grows in the AMA

140
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:31,439
desert of Chile which is a region uh uh

141
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:34,280
that receives on average like half an

142
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:35,399
inch of rainfall a year uh it's it's

143
00:05:34,279 --> 00:05:37,679
pretty remarkable if you look at these

144
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:39,599
pictures these are Landscapes that are

145
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:42,240
like devoid of all plant life but

146
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:45,160
somehow miraculously there are like wild

147
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,960
tomatoes growing there uh for for many

148
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:48,520
years this was a species that breeders

149
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:50,198
didn't really have access to working

150
00:05:48,519 --> 00:05:52,719
with because of cross compatibility

151
00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:55,400
barriers uh but recently a team at UC

152
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:57,479
Davis uh through a very complex Crossing

153
00:05:55,399 --> 00:05:59,279
scheme and many years of effort were

154
00:05:57,478 --> 00:06:00,000
able to develop a set of integration

155
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:01,758
lines

156
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,560
DNA from this species in the background

157
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:07,680
of domesticates made we're starting to

158
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:07,680
look at that for some abiotic stress

159
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:17,400
tolerances but you know the most

160
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:19,000
important traits that have come from uh

161
00:06:17,399 --> 00:06:21,120
wild tomatoes have been disease

162
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,598
resistances and you know in the rest of

163
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,240
my talk I'm going to talk about how it's

164
00:06:22,598 --> 00:06:26,199
important to understand the genetics not

165
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:28,439
just of the host but of the pathogen as

166
00:06:26,199 --> 00:06:30,680
well uh you know this this is obviously

167
00:06:28,439 --> 00:06:32,399
not a novel concept at all it's pretty

168
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:35,400
fundamental I think to the field of

169
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:38,318
plant mythology was demonstrated by Flor

170
00:06:35,399 --> 00:06:41,399
in the in the 50s working on Flax and

171
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:44,598
flax rest who showed that the disease

172
00:06:41,399 --> 00:06:47,120
outcome depended on the genotype of the

173
00:06:44,598 --> 00:06:49,319
plant and also the genotype of the

174
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:51,639
pathogen which he summarized you know

175
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:54,680
very succinctly in his conclusion to

176
00:06:51,639 --> 00:06:56,400
this very seminal paper uh but in terms

177
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:58,240
of how I kind of like came around to

178
00:06:56,399 --> 00:07:00,560
this concept you know 70 years after

179
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:03,400
everybody else did

180
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:06,000
uh I I want to talk about the research I

181
00:07:03,399 --> 00:07:08,120
did on phyto or capsy as a graduate

182
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,560
student um if you're unfamiliar with

183
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:13,800
phyto capsy it causes a disease called

184
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:17,879
phyto blight this is a disease that's

185
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:19,879
very difficult to manage um you know for

186
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:22,240
for Growers for a couple of reasons it

187
00:07:19,879 --> 00:07:24,639
produces these thick wall breasting

188
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:27,280
spores these are sexual spores that can

189
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:31,038
survive in the soil for over 10 years uh

190
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:33,598
dormant in the absence of a susceptible

191
00:07:31,038 --> 00:07:35,598
it also has a really explosive asexual

192
00:07:33,598 --> 00:07:38,399
life cycle so the spanga that you can

193
00:07:35,598 --> 00:07:40,360
see on the surface of this pumpkin fruit

194
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:43,598
here uh in wet conditions they

195
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:46,199
differentiate into 20 to 40 mold zores

196
00:07:43,598 --> 00:07:48,800
that in wet conditions can swim through

197
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:51,280
water and identify new hosts to effect

198
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:53,000
so FAL blood causes a range of disease

199
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:55,158
symptoms different disease syndromes it

200
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,959
causes damping off it causes root and

201
00:07:55,158 --> 00:08:00,560
Crown rot causes fruit rot it affects

202
00:07:57,959 --> 00:08:02,799
solci species curbit a couple of other

203
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,800
important vegetable species and one kind

204
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:07,439
of consistent thing that we've seen with

205
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:10,879
Pho light is that often it's introduced

206
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:13,199
to farms in flood waters um so a farmer

207
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:15,879
may have no experience with this disease

208
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:18,240
there'll be a really severe uh rainfall

209
00:08:15,879 --> 00:08:20,520
event a neighboring you know body of

210
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:22,759
water will flood and then a week or two

211
00:08:20,519 --> 00:08:25,318
later they'll see you know really uh

212
00:08:22,759 --> 00:08:26,960
severe uh crop loss in their fields once

213
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:29,960
it's introduced it's pretty much

214
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:31,478
impossible to eradicate and un with you

215
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:32,718
know change that we see in our weather

216
00:08:31,478 --> 00:08:35,799
weather patterns it seems like it's

217
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:35,800
becoming more and more

218
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:40,799
commmon so when I started my PhD I I

219
00:08:38,918 --> 00:08:43,158
came into an ongoing project on breeding

220
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:44,599
for resistance to squash at at that time

221
00:08:43,158 --> 00:08:47,240
and and actually still today there's

222
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:49,839
really no commercial available

223
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:51,839
resistance in squash to phyo root and

224
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:54,279
Crown Rod this was a project that was a

225
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:57,399
collaboration between Chris's lab and

226
00:08:54,278 --> 00:09:00,240
and Michael mich's uh vegetable breeding

227
00:08:57,399 --> 00:09:02,519
program the methods that that we used

228
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:04,360
for uh selecting resistance were pretty

229
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:05,839
straightforward but but very effective

230
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:08,240
we would grow our populations of

231
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:11,200
seedlings in the greenhouse inoculate

232
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:12,959
them with the suspension of zoospores

233
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:15,278
and then a week or two later you know

234
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:16,679
sort through all those dying plants and

235
00:09:15,278 --> 00:09:19,360
find the ones that are the most green

236
00:09:16,679 --> 00:09:21,719
and pop those up and use those for more

237
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:23,800
Crossing uh and and like I said this

238
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:25,639
this worked pretty well uh we put the

239
00:09:23,799 --> 00:09:28,199
results of this project into field

240
00:09:25,639 --> 00:09:29,958
trials uh here you can see a susceptible

241
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:31,360
toini C

242
00:09:29,958 --> 00:09:33,000
uh or maybe you can't see it because the

243
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,800
plants are pretty much dead at this

244
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,639
point a couple weeks after

245
00:09:34,799 --> 00:09:38,879
inoculation uh this is actually the

246
00:09:36,639 --> 00:09:41,078
source of resistance that was used in

247
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:43,078
this resistance breeding program you can

248
00:09:41,078 --> 00:09:44,599
see it has somewhat of an intermediate F

249
00:09:43,078 --> 00:09:46,719
Type and then the lines that we

250
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:49,759
developed uh actually had resistance

251
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:51,278
level superior to the resistant parent

252
00:09:49,759 --> 00:09:53,240
uh unfortunately in the process of

253
00:09:51,278 --> 00:09:56,399
selecting you know more or less

254
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:58,120
exclusively based on seedling resistance

255
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:00,919
we lost a lot of the traits that make it

256
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:04,759
good as a zucchini but uh we did show

257
00:10:00,919 --> 00:10:04,759
that you can select for resistance to

258
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:09,799
phot I spent a lot of time in the

259
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:13,440
greenhouse inoculating seedlings and

260
00:10:09,799 --> 00:10:16,278
associating variation in uh the disease

261
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:18,800
response with variation uh in their DNA

262
00:10:16,278 --> 00:10:21,320
polymorphisms and identifying qtl

263
00:10:18,799 --> 00:10:23,278
related to resistance uh within several

264
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:25,879
different experiments we mapped the

265
00:10:23,278 --> 00:10:27,278
total of six qtl related to phyo Crown

266
00:10:25,879 --> 00:10:29,720
and root route

267
00:10:27,278 --> 00:10:32,679
resistance we found that these qtl

268
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:33,920
individually uh had very small effect uh

269
00:10:32,679 --> 00:10:36,759
if you look at these plots these are

270
00:10:33,919 --> 00:10:39,399
showing theic effects of markers in

271
00:10:36,759 --> 00:10:43,159
these regions U and if you look at their

272
00:10:39,399 --> 00:10:45,120
effect on relative adbc it's very slight

273
00:10:43,159 --> 00:10:47,240
and individually these markers explain

274
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,759
anywhere from like two to 10% of the

275
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:52,519
fenic

276
00:10:48,759 --> 00:10:53,600
variation um however collectively uh you

277
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:56,320
know they can make pretty big

278
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:58,680
differences so uh you know when you

279
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:02,120
increase the number of qtl that are

280
00:10:58,679 --> 00:11:04,838
fixed for the resistant o uh lines that

281
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:06,720
had five of these resistant uh

282
00:11:04,839 --> 00:11:08,639
resistance Qs compared to lines that had

283
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:10,399
zero had pretty substantial difference

284
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:12,200
in terms of their disease

285
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:14,200
response that being said you know this

286
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:18,278
is pretty challenging for a breeder to

287
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:19,879
work with um because you know uh a

288
00:11:18,278 --> 00:11:21,360
breeder is not just selecting for these

289
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:22,720
five genes there's probably many more

290
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,480
genes that we weren't able to map there

291
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:29,079
even of smaller effect they're selecting

292
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:33,120
for uh resistance to other diseases

293
00:11:29,078 --> 00:11:35,039
growth habit fruit shape shelf life uh

294
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:37,200
even When selecting for like a single

295
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:39,199
qualitative R Gene often it's difficult

296
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:41,240
because of the other genes that tend to

297
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:45,200
come along with it so selecting for five

298
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:47,278
small effect genes uh really

299
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:49,680
challenging one one thing that wasn't

300
00:11:47,278 --> 00:11:52,278
challenging about phyo root and Crown

301
00:11:49,679 --> 00:11:54,078
rot resistance and squash was that it

302
00:11:52,278 --> 00:11:56,399
was really consisting across different

303
00:11:54,078 --> 00:11:59,039
strains of the pathogen uh so here you

304
00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:02,200
can see disease incidence over time with

305
00:11:59,039 --> 00:12:04,519
in two varieties um our resistant

306
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:06,519
breeding line and susceptible as a candy

307
00:12:04,519 --> 00:12:08,600
check the different line types are

308
00:12:06,519 --> 00:12:10,360
different strains of the pathogen we did

309
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:11,879
this a few times with different strains

310
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:14,480
both from around New York and around the

311
00:12:11,879 --> 00:12:16,480
country and we found pretty similar

312
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:20,120
results consistently it didn't really

313
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:22,120
matter uh what strain was we inoculated

314
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:23,560
with uh they all caused similar levels

315
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:26,440
of disease and there were no

316
00:12:23,559 --> 00:12:28,679
interactions the resistance level of the

317
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:31,399
plant genotype was not conditional which

318
00:12:28,679 --> 00:12:33,919
I it was challenged

319
00:12:31,399 --> 00:12:36,198
with so that that's a very different

320
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:38,639
case than the case in Pepper and I'm

321
00:12:36,198 --> 00:12:42,838
going to talk uh more about that in

322
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:46,759
depth um the way that I became exposed

323
00:12:42,839 --> 00:12:48,959
to um you know this phenomenon in Pepper

324
00:12:46,759 --> 00:12:51,720
was through field trials at the Cornell

325
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:53,799
phyo form so many of you probably know

326
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:56,480
that in Geneva uh there are fields that

327
00:12:53,799 --> 00:12:59,479
are dedicated exclusively to research on

328
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:02,240
phyo BL uh you know Chris

329
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:04,519
lab uses those uh for many research

330
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:06,440
projects and it's also a resource for

331
00:13:04,519 --> 00:13:08,839
breeders around the country uh to

332
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:13,920
conduct trials to see how their germ

333
00:13:08,839 --> 00:13:13,920
plasm um performs uh in inoculated

334
00:13:17,159 --> 00:13:24,120
trials so so being Chris's student who

335
00:13:19,879 --> 00:13:26,360
worked on phyo capsy I also had the uh

336
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:28,198
honor of managing some of these trials

337
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:30,079
which was uh a really excellent learning

338
00:13:28,198 --> 00:13:31,198
experience

339
00:13:30,078 --> 00:13:33,439
uh but it was also something that we you

340
00:13:31,198 --> 00:13:35,000
know there were challenges as well uh if

341
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,959
you look at this picture you can see my

342
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:40,559
labmate at the time Ally she's she's

343
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:41,759
dumping hyto infested vermiculite into

344
00:13:40,559 --> 00:13:44,239
every single hole that we're going to

345
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:45,958
transplant our pepper seedlings into I

346
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,399
would then go back through like two or

347
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:49,599
three times over the next several weeks

348
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:52,320
and spray each plant with a suspension

349
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:54,040
of Zo spores but still Often by the end

350
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:57,320
of the season we would have fields that

351
00:13:54,039 --> 00:13:59,240
look like this um breeders would want to

352
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:00,959
come out and select their most resistant

353
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:04,120
plants but everything would look really

354
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:06,879
healthy uh wasn't always easy to get

355
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:08,320
disease we started to suspect that it

356
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:10,480
maybe because of the isolate that we

357
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:13,399
were using so this is like a typical

358
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:15,800
result that we would see with um the

359
00:14:13,399 --> 00:14:17,958
isolate that we had been using uh we've

360
00:14:15,799 --> 00:14:19,479
killed maybe a thousand out of 2 200

361
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:20,719
plants which I guess I guess isn't bad

362
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:22,079
but still some of the Breeders we worked

363
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:24,320
with were frustrated they wanted to see

364
00:14:22,078 --> 00:14:27,120
more differences and select more plants

365
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:30,240
especially in their early generation

366
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:31,639
material so the uh in 2018 we decided to

367
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:34,879
use a different isolate I'll talk more

368
00:14:31,639 --> 00:14:37,120
about how we found that isolate um but

369
00:14:34,879 --> 00:14:39,439
here we actually like had the opposite

370
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:42,440
problem uh by the end of the season only

371
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:46,360
150 of the 2,800 plants we put in that

372
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:48,480
field had survived uh this was honestly

373
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:49,959
probably worse than the result we had

374
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:51,399
the first case the Breeders weren't able

375
00:14:49,958 --> 00:14:53,799
to select any plants because all the

376
00:14:51,399 --> 00:14:56,958
plants were were

377
00:14:53,799 --> 00:14:59,838
dead so how did we discover that isolate

378
00:14:56,958 --> 00:15:03,119
that we inoculated that field with uh in

379
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:06,199
the winter between uh field seasons in

380
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:08,039
2017 and 2018 I went to the lab and

381
00:15:06,198 --> 00:15:10,639
grabbed just 30 cultures you know

382
00:15:08,039 --> 00:15:13,039
somewhat randomly from uh Chris's uh

383
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:15,600
culture collection and alculated them

384
00:15:13,039 --> 00:15:17,679
onto three different bell pepper hybrids

385
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:20,680
with different kind of overall levels of

386
00:15:17,679 --> 00:15:22,879
resistance and I was really Amazed by

387
00:15:20,679 --> 00:15:26,000
how much variation that we saw in terms

388
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:28,000
of the disease caused by these isolates

389
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,720
uh ranging from you know strains that

390
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:33,318
were only a ble to kill you know a small

391
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,959
number of most susceptible variety so

392
00:15:33,318 --> 00:15:36,879
strains that caused high levels of

393
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:39,119
disease in all three of the varieties

394
00:15:36,879 --> 00:15:42,879
including Paladin which is uh marketed

395
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,879
in Su catalog so it's resistant to

396
00:15:42,919 --> 00:15:50,719
phy if you see here um where is it let's

397
00:15:47,318 --> 00:15:52,479
see 0664 D1 so this is the strain we had

398
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:54,800
been using in the field

399
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:57,319
trials we went all the way to the right

400
00:15:54,799 --> 00:15:59,278
side of the plot to 1455 for the next

401
00:15:57,318 --> 00:16:00,318
year's trial you you know in hindsight

402
00:15:59,278 --> 00:16:02,439
we probably should have gone somewhere

403
00:16:00,318 --> 00:16:05,000
in the middle and not uh all the way to

404
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:05,000
the Other

405
00:16:05,278 --> 00:16:11,078
Extreme but you know this was a a really

406
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,318
uh interesting I guess Revelation for me

407
00:16:11,078 --> 00:16:13,599
you know the reason that I got into

408
00:16:12,318 --> 00:16:16,559
plant breeding was because I was so

409
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:19,240
fascinated by fpic diversity in crop

410
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:20,919
plants and vegetables especially and to

411
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:23,639
realize that there's all this fent typic

412
00:16:20,919 --> 00:16:25,679
diversity in microbes as well uh you

413
00:16:23,639 --> 00:16:27,799
know just really really struck me and I

414
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:29,679
I started to become more interested like

415
00:16:27,799 --> 00:16:32,078
less in the different between the

416
00:16:29,679 --> 00:16:34,278
planets and more kind of the differences

417
00:16:32,078 --> 00:16:35,799
between the strains right like I wanted

418
00:16:34,278 --> 00:16:37,919
to know what what was it about this

419
00:16:35,799 --> 00:16:39,278
strain that enabled it to cause disease

420
00:16:37,919 --> 00:16:43,838
on Paladin and

421
00:16:39,278 --> 00:16:47,000
MRA uh unable to do

422
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:50,360
that so I was really lucky to have

423
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:53,480
access to uh lots of excellent resources

424
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:55,039
in Chris's lab so you know we had a a

425
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:56,800
culture collection with hundreds of

426
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:59,000
isolate soy

427
00:16:56,799 --> 00:17:01,240
capsy there had been pre previous grad

428
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:04,038
students who had worked on this pathogen

429
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:05,759
and worked out like a lot of uh the

430
00:17:04,038 --> 00:17:08,838
details that were needed to do this

431
00:17:05,759 --> 00:17:10,199
experiments so Chris's student Amara dun

432
00:17:08,838 --> 00:17:12,318
developed like really excellent

433
00:17:10,199 --> 00:17:14,318
protocols for culturing and using

434
00:17:12,318 --> 00:17:17,639
inoculum and doing inoculations with

435
00:17:14,318 --> 00:17:20,599
this pathogen uh we also had experience

436
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:22,000
with highdensity Gene typing F capsy A

437
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:23,958
lot of those bioinformatic pipelines

438
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,279
were developed by Chris's student uh

439
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:27,439
Marin Carlson so I was able to kind of

440
00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:28,918
put these things together and think

441
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:32,400
about how to answer some of research

442
00:17:28,919 --> 00:17:35,600
questions I had and I thought you know

443
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:37,960
could we genotype maybe the culture

444
00:17:35,599 --> 00:17:40,480
collection with high density snit

445
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:42,840
markers inoculate it onto a series of

446
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:45,000
different pepper varieties and then

447
00:17:42,839 --> 00:17:46,879
identify markers associated with

448
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,558
variation and virulence on these

449
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:49,559
different pepper

450
00:17:50,798 --> 00:17:56,679
varieties so so that's that's what we

451
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:59,880
did uh the first thing we had to do was

452
00:17:56,679 --> 00:18:01,440
assemble our culture collection ction uh

453
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:03,760
many of these cultures you know we

454
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:05,440
already had um in store they had been

455
00:18:03,759 --> 00:18:06,919
collected at some point over previous 10

456
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:08,798
years or so Chris also had really

457
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:10,520
excellent relationships with Growers and

458
00:18:08,798 --> 00:18:11,798
extension Specialists were able to go

459
00:18:10,519 --> 00:18:14,000
and collect more

460
00:18:11,798 --> 00:18:16,119
strains uh it was actually kind of like

461
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,640
a almost like a like a treasury hunt

462
00:18:16,119 --> 00:18:19,239
like I remember going to Wegman's and

463
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:21,600
finding a ring zucchini and bringing it

464
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:24,240
to the lab and and being like amazed to

465
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:26,319
pull F caps see out of uh so it was fun

466
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:28,640
to kind of expand this this culture

467
00:18:26,319 --> 00:18:31,000
collection this plot you can see the

468
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:32,720
sites that the strains came from each

469
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,519
circle is like a different field and the

470
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:36,360
size of the circle is proportional to

471
00:18:34,519 --> 00:18:38,440
how many strains we collected out of

472
00:18:36,359 --> 00:18:41,558
that field we also got a small number of

473
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:44,440
strains from other states as

474
00:18:41,558 --> 00:18:47,720
well so we genotyped the strains with

475
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:50,159
Gen typing by sequencing which is uh A

476
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:52,200
reduced representation whole genum

477
00:18:50,159 --> 00:18:55,200
sequencing approach it's a way to

478
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:57,080
basically assay Snips at thousands of

479
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:59,558
sites uh across the

480
00:18:57,079 --> 00:19:02,158
genome um one thing that we could do

481
00:18:59,558 --> 00:19:04,558
with this data was we looked at the

482
00:19:02,159 --> 00:19:07,240
pairwise genetic similarity between all

483
00:19:04,558 --> 00:19:09,038
of our isolates and when you do that and

484
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:11,558
you make a histogram of all those

485
00:19:09,038 --> 00:19:15,079
pairwise genetic similarities you get

486
00:19:11,558 --> 00:19:18,119
this uh Tri modal distribution and what

487
00:19:15,079 --> 00:19:20,319
what that is is that this peak here of

488
00:19:18,119 --> 00:19:21,678
pairs of isolates that are least related

489
00:19:20,319 --> 00:19:23,798
to each other these are isolates from

490
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:27,679
different field sites the peak in the

491
00:19:23,798 --> 00:19:29,480
middle these are isolates that are um

492
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:31,559
genetically distinct but from the same

493
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:33,319
field site so related to each other and

494
00:19:31,558 --> 00:19:35,200
then we have this peak all the way at

495
00:19:33,319 --> 00:19:37,480
the right close to 100% genetic

496
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:39,480
similarity that includes technical

497
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:42,038
replicates of the same isolate sequence

498
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:44,519
multiple times which also told us that

499
00:19:42,038 --> 00:19:46,679
pairs of isolates that appear here are

500
00:19:44,519 --> 00:19:48,960
likely clonally derived from the same

501
00:19:46,679 --> 00:19:51,519
common ancestor so we could use this to

502
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:54,279
identify different clonal groups of itop

503
00:19:51,519 --> 00:19:56,440
capsy in our isolate uh

504
00:19:54,279 --> 00:19:58,599
collection one thing that we found which

505
00:19:56,440 --> 00:20:01,240
made sense with the biology of the path

506
00:19:58,599 --> 00:20:04,519
was that every phonal group was unique

507
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:09,079
to a particular field and your uh you

508
00:20:04,519 --> 00:20:10,720
know which uh is what we expected given

509
00:20:09,079 --> 00:20:12,678
that the asexual scores are very

510
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:14,519
shortlived whereas the sexual scores

511
00:20:12,679 --> 00:20:17,559
product of meiosis are the ones that

512
00:20:14,519 --> 00:20:17,558
over winter from year to

513
00:20:18,919 --> 00:20:24,080
year so you know just looking at one

514
00:20:22,279 --> 00:20:25,519
isolate per clonal group and looking at

515
00:20:24,079 --> 00:20:27,639
the population structure of this

516
00:20:25,519 --> 00:20:29,558
collection of isolates here if you look

517
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,679
at the principal components analysis

518
00:20:29,558 --> 00:20:32,720
plot on the left and the neighbor

519
00:20:30,679 --> 00:20:34,360
joining Tree on the right the different

520
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:36,279
colors represent different regions of

521
00:20:34,359 --> 00:20:39,158
New York and the different symbols

522
00:20:36,279 --> 00:20:42,240
within a color are different field sites

523
00:20:39,159 --> 00:20:44,799
um and what we found was that in almost

524
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:46,759
every case uh an isolate from a

525
00:20:44,798 --> 00:20:49,000
particular field site was more likely to

526
00:20:46,759 --> 00:20:50,200
be closely related to another isolate

527
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,519
from that same field site than to

528
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:55,319
another isolate in our collection and

529
00:20:52,519 --> 00:20:57,839
this was even true at really uh small

530
00:20:55,319 --> 00:21:00,000
spatial scales so if you look at these

531
00:20:57,839 --> 00:21:02,240
per triangles here and these purple

532
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,720
circles here these came from two fields

533
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:05,960
in Western New York that were separated

534
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:07,360
by about a mile uh you can see that

535
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:08,640
they're more closely related to each

536
00:21:07,359 --> 00:21:10,399
other than they are to any of the other

537
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:12,159
isolet that we sequenced but they're

538
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:14,120
still totally differentiated from one

539
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:15,679
another so it's just this really

540
00:21:14,119 --> 00:21:20,959
interesting

541
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:23,519
um you know uh example of how these like

542
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:25,480
pretty rare founder events of how these

543
00:21:23,519 --> 00:21:28,679
these populations are introduced to

544
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:30,319
Fields uh end up contributing to pretty

545
00:21:28,679 --> 00:21:33,120
strong genetic differentiation over time

546
00:21:30,319 --> 00:21:33,119
through drift or

547
00:21:35,519 --> 00:21:40,240
selection another thing that we found

548
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:42,720
was evidence of it seemed like you know

549
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:43,919
a pretty widespread chromosomal copy

550
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:46,038
number

551
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:49,440
variation uh the way we could look at

552
00:21:46,038 --> 00:21:51,519
this was by looking at uh read depths uh

553
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:54,480
sequencing read depths and in particular

554
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:57,359
read depths for heterozygous sites so if

555
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:58,839
if you sequence a heterozygous site on

556
00:21:57,359 --> 00:22:00,240
average you should expect about half of

557
00:21:58,839 --> 00:22:01,720
the reads that you sequence to belong to

558
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:03,558
one Al and the other half to belong to

559
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:06,159
the other Al there'll be some noise

560
00:22:03,558 --> 00:22:07,918
because of you know sampling uh but if

561
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:09,440
you look at a histogram of all the sites

562
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:11,559
across the genome that are heter zous

563
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:13,038
for particular isolate you should expect

564
00:22:11,558 --> 00:22:15,960
like a normal distribution standard

565
00:22:13,038 --> 00:22:18,960
around 0.5 and that's what we saw for

566
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:21,400
some of the isets for other isets we saw

567
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:23,400
you know bodal distributions with Peaks

568
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:25,600
at 0.33 and

569
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:27,278
0.66 these are likely genome white

570
00:22:25,599 --> 00:22:30,839
triploids we also saw evidence of

571
00:22:27,278 --> 00:22:33,359
tetrols or possible higher uh copy

572
00:22:30,839 --> 00:22:36,000
number uh

573
00:22:33,359 --> 00:22:37,918
isolates we we we don't have a a

574
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,400
chromosome level reference genome for

575
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:42,120
phyo capsy but there had been a genetic

576
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:44,120
map published before we were able to

577
00:22:42,119 --> 00:22:45,719
Anchor our snip markers to that genetic

578
00:22:44,119 --> 00:22:46,879
map to assign them to linkage groups

579
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:49,000
which you can think of you know

580
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:50,120
essentially as chromosomes and it was

581
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,200
really interesting to see that even

582
00:22:50,119 --> 00:22:54,759
within a genome we saw all this copy

583
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:57,600
number variation so for this particular

584
00:22:54,759 --> 00:22:58,519
isolate here I'm showing uh you know 16

585
00:22:57,599 --> 00:23:00,759
of it

586
00:22:58,519 --> 00:23:02,480
uh chromosomes appear to be deployed and

587
00:23:00,759 --> 00:23:05,359
then it has two chromosomes that it

588
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:07,640
seems to have three copies of and you

589
00:23:05,359 --> 00:23:10,240
know this was really widespread um

590
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:12,840
didn't really seem to be much uh

591
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:15,240
patterns all of the linkage groups were

592
00:23:12,839 --> 00:23:17,319
of we found to be triploid or of a

593
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:19,278
higher Ploy level than at least one

594
00:23:17,319 --> 00:23:21,038
isolate uh we did find a couple of

595
00:23:19,278 --> 00:23:24,480
linkage groups that that had the highest

596
00:23:21,038 --> 00:23:25,720
incidence of higher PL levels but one

597
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:30,319
thing that I think was interesting about

598
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:32,679
this was that it appears that this anlo

599
00:23:30,319 --> 00:23:35,399
was mitotically derived as opposed to

600
00:23:32,679 --> 00:23:37,278
meiotically derived and the reason that

601
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:39,919
I think that is because within a certain

602
00:23:37,278 --> 00:23:42,400
clonal group we would find individual

603
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:43,720
isolates that would be anoyed for a

604
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,159
chromosome and that wouldn't be shared

605
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:47,759
by other isolates within that same

606
00:23:45,159 --> 00:23:50,039
phonal lineage uh so it seems like this

607
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:52,720
you know like widespread variation

608
00:23:50,038 --> 00:23:56,400
arises very spontaneously and very

609
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:56,400
rapidly in populations of

610
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,880
C

611
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:06,240
so we assay all of our isolates for B

612
00:24:04,038 --> 00:24:09,038
type by co-culturing them with isolat of

613
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:11,159
no mating type checking for the presence

614
00:24:09,038 --> 00:24:14,640
of oospores

615
00:24:11,159 --> 00:24:16,960
um we use that as a Fen type in a genome

616
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:19,240
wide Association study so if you look at

617
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:21,759
the Manhattan plot here on the x-axis is

618
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:23,400
basically chromosomal location typically

619
00:24:21,759 --> 00:24:25,240
there'll be alternating colors for

620
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:26,880
chromosomes but again like we don't have

621
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:29,599
chromosome level assemblies so they

622
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:31,679
scaffolds of the genome assembly and

623
00:24:29,599 --> 00:24:34,240
then the y- AIS the negative log 10 P

624
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:37,080
value so the higher the point the higher

625
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:40,159
the association with that that fan type

626
00:24:37,079 --> 00:24:41,918
uh we saw a strong Peak on scaffold 4

627
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:44,039
this trait had been mapped by others in

628
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:45,919
experimental crosses they found the same

629
00:24:44,038 --> 00:24:48,038
result a region on scaffold 4 that

630
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:49,960
determines M type uh we also

631
00:24:48,038 --> 00:24:53,480
corroborated previous results that show

632
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:55,880
that the A1 isolates uh had one hype at

633
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:59,480
that Locus and the A2 isolates had two

634
00:24:55,880 --> 00:25:01,640
Hypes so it seemed that uh mating type

635
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:04,960
in phyo capsy and this has been shown in

636
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:07,320
in other old my species appears to be

637
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:11,640
inherited analogous lead to like XY sex

638
00:25:07,319 --> 00:25:11,639
determination species uh such as in

639
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:19,798
animals so we also uh assayed the

640
00:25:16,839 --> 00:25:24,759
isolates for resistance to the fungicide

641
00:25:19,798 --> 00:25:27,000
uh methoxy which uh was used I think for

642
00:25:24,759 --> 00:25:28,919
the first time in the 70s I believe and

643
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,839
know resistance showed up shortly after

644
00:25:28,919 --> 00:25:32,799
that ined

645
00:25:30,839 --> 00:25:35,319
species and this trait hadn't been

646
00:25:32,798 --> 00:25:37,839
mapped before in phy capsy we found a

647
00:25:35,319 --> 00:25:39,639
strong Peak on scaffold 62 it had been

648
00:25:37,839 --> 00:25:43,519
assumed for a long time that the target

649
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:46,600
site of methoxy was RNA polymerase 3 uh

650
00:25:43,519 --> 00:25:50,519
because methoxy interferes with our

651
00:25:46,599 --> 00:25:52,879
Rosal RNA synthesis uh in all my seats

652
00:25:50,519 --> 00:25:55,639
we didn't find any genes annotated as

653
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:57,679
subunits of RNA p 3 in that in that

654
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:58,480
region but what we did find was this gen

655
00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:00,960
Gene

656
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:03,798
rrp5 which is a gene involved in

657
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:05,640
assembling pre-ribosomal RNA into

658
00:26:03,798 --> 00:26:07,359
ribosomes so it seemed to us like a

659
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:09,880
pretty strong candidate for the Target

660
00:26:07,359 --> 00:26:12,319
side of methoxy and since we published

661
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:15,600
this actually uh a Crossing experiment

662
00:26:12,319 --> 00:26:19,639
in phyo festin has implicated the same

663
00:26:15,599 --> 00:26:19,639
gene in uh metal axle

664
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:25,600
resistance so the the the gws results

665
00:26:22,599 --> 00:26:27,798
for mating type and nephin oxin

666
00:26:25,599 --> 00:26:29,759
resistance were very promising uh we

667
00:26:27,798 --> 00:26:31,918
were very excited to you know use the

668
00:26:29,759 --> 00:26:34,158
same approach for veillance on on

669
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:36,440
different different pepper varieties so

670
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:39,200
we started to generate that fanpic data

671
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:41,038
uh we took a subset of 117 isolet that

672
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:43,200
were genetically unique from our isolate

673
00:26:41,038 --> 00:26:45,759
collection and we challenged those onto

674
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:48,480
16 different varieties of peppers these

675
00:26:45,759 --> 00:26:50,240
were both commercial hybrids and lines

676
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:52,759
that have been used by others as

677
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:56,359
differentials for phyto

678
00:26:52,759 --> 00:26:58,798
caps we evaluated plants for incidents

679
00:26:56,359 --> 00:27:02,359
of mortality over time time turn that

680
00:26:58,798 --> 00:27:04,839
into audc altogether this was about 1900

681
00:27:02,359 --> 00:27:07,278
unique combinations of host and pathogen

682
00:27:04,839 --> 00:27:10,639
so it was quite a bit of phenotyping and

683
00:27:07,278 --> 00:27:10,640
we repeated this twice for most

684
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:14,959
combinations so you know I guess the

685
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:18,079
first question is like were there

686
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:22,159
interactions between pathogen isolate

687
00:27:18,079 --> 00:27:24,480
and pepper variety or accession and that

688
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:26,320
Thea table says yes but it doesn't

689
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:27,839
really tell us much about the nature of

690
00:27:26,319 --> 00:27:30,759
those interactions we wanted to kind of

691
00:27:27,839 --> 00:27:32,678
characterize the pattern of those

692
00:27:30,759 --> 00:27:34,038
interactions so you know we tried to

693
00:27:32,679 --> 00:27:37,278
visualize this in a couple different

694
00:27:34,038 --> 00:27:39,720
ways if if you look at this plot uh each

695
00:27:37,278 --> 00:27:42,200
subplot represents a different

696
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:44,440
isolate on the x-axis are the different

697
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:48,000
pepper varieties increasing an order of

698
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:51,600
susceptibility from left to right in

699
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:55,000
each plot the the black dash line is the

700
00:27:51,599 --> 00:27:56,959
average level of disease caused you know

701
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:59,679
across all isolates on a particular

702
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:01,399
pepper EX session and then the red line

703
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:04,559
is the level of disease caused by that

704
00:28:01,398 --> 00:28:06,518
particular isolate um so kind you know

705
00:28:04,558 --> 00:28:09,119
kind of a lot to like take in but a

706
00:28:06,519 --> 00:28:12,079
couple of things that uh we noticed

707
00:28:09,119 --> 00:28:14,639
looking at this data uh one is that on

708
00:28:12,079 --> 00:28:16,798
average the disease caused by particular

709
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:19,679
isolate tends to increase with the

710
00:28:16,798 --> 00:28:21,960
overall susceptibility of a pepper

711
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:23,840
excession although there were some cases

712
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:26,519
where that wasn't the case right like

713
00:28:23,839 --> 00:28:28,558
like here another thing we saw was that

714
00:28:26,519 --> 00:28:31,679
there was a lot of

715
00:28:28,558 --> 00:28:34,879
uh variation between isolates that came

716
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:37,559
from the same location so the background

717
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:40,000
color of these plots indicates what site

718
00:28:37,558 --> 00:28:41,480
they came from in New York um so like

719
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,720
all these blue isolates came from one

720
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:45,919
field for example if you look at this

721
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:47,759
dark these dark green squares these were

722
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:49,840
two different isolates that came from a

723
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:51,960
squash field in Long Island you'll see

724
00:28:49,839 --> 00:28:53,678
that one caused you know fairly average

725
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:56,200
levels of disease on all on all the

726
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:57,798
pepper varieties and this other isol

727
00:28:56,200 --> 00:29:01,278
same location caus very high high levels

728
00:28:57,798 --> 00:29:01,278
of disease uh across the

729
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:08,880
board you know we wanted to kind of uh

730
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:10,960
find ways to characterize this variation

731
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:14,519
more and because I'm trained as a plant

732
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:17,480
breeder I I I turn to to methods used in

733
00:29:14,519 --> 00:29:19,679
plant breeding uh so one thing that I

734
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:23,599
looked at is what we called veilance

735
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:25,440
stability uh so this is analogous to

736
00:29:23,599 --> 00:29:28,000
like yield stability analysis that's

737
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:30,640
used by plant breeders in analysis of

738
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:32,720
genotype by environment interaction data

739
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:35,720
so that the idea is you you evaluate

740
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:37,759
different varieties of a of a crop in

741
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:39,120
different environments and then you can

742
00:29:37,759 --> 00:29:40,960
look at how stable the performance of

743
00:29:39,119 --> 00:29:43,000
those varieties is across the

744
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:45,440
environments uh by regressing the

745
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:49,079
individual variety yield on the average

746
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:53,080
yield for each environment uh the the a

747
00:29:49,079 --> 00:29:56,199
good uh example of this um would be like

748
00:29:53,079 --> 00:29:57,839
a variety that's very responsive to

749
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:59,759
fertility uh

750
00:29:57,839 --> 00:30:02,759
that variety would have a very high

751
00:29:59,759 --> 00:30:05,240
slope in this analysis it would perform

752
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:07,398
very poorly in low fernal environments

753
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:09,399
and it would perform very well in highly

754
00:30:07,398 --> 00:30:10,918
fernal environments whereas a variety

755
00:30:09,398 --> 00:30:14,158
that's more stable would just have kind

756
00:30:10,919 --> 00:30:16,440
of a more uh intermediate uh performance

757
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:18,320
across the board so the way that we

758
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:22,200
looked at this we basically treated

759
00:30:18,319 --> 00:30:25,599
isolates as crop varieties um and pepper

760
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:28,519
hols as environments and uh regress

761
00:30:25,599 --> 00:30:30,798
disease caused by individual ises on the

762
00:30:28,519 --> 00:30:33,079
average disease seen on the

763
00:30:30,798 --> 00:30:34,918
pepper um when you do that you kind of

764
00:30:33,079 --> 00:30:37,439
see that isolates fall into one of three

765
00:30:34,919 --> 00:30:38,880
categories low slope and low intercept

766
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:41,278
those are isolates that cause low levels

767
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:43,000
of disease across the board low

768
00:30:41,278 --> 00:30:44,759
intercept and high slope those are

769
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,960
isolates that tend to cause average

770
00:30:44,759 --> 00:30:49,200
levels of disease on all of the pepper

771
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:50,558
accessions and then isolates with high

772
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,840
intercept and low slope those are

773
00:30:50,558 --> 00:30:54,278
isolates that cause high levels of

774
00:30:51,839 --> 00:30:56,000
disease on all Peppers uh you know that

775
00:30:54,278 --> 00:30:57,759
tells us something and then another

776
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:00,319
parameter that you can get from this

777
00:30:57,759 --> 00:31:03,359
model is the mean square error it's like

778
00:31:00,319 --> 00:31:08,398
how well can you predict the disease

779
00:31:03,359 --> 00:31:10,079
caused by an isolate as a linear uh uh

780
00:31:08,398 --> 00:31:12,638
relationship with the overall

781
00:31:10,079 --> 00:31:14,599
susceptibility of the host and in most

782
00:31:12,638 --> 00:31:16,839
cases you can predicted very well most

783
00:31:14,599 --> 00:31:18,719
isolates had a low mpare error but there

784
00:31:16,839 --> 00:31:20,480
were a few that that had a really high

785
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:22,200
mpare error in other words you you

786
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:23,599
couldn't really tell how it was going to

787
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:27,278
what kind of disease would cause in a

788
00:31:23,599 --> 00:31:31,000
pepper accession uh knowing solely that

789
00:31:27,278 --> 00:31:31,000
overall susceptibility level of that

790
00:31:33,398 --> 00:31:37,439
pepper okay we we next tried to look at

791
00:31:35,759 --> 00:31:39,720
the association between pathogen

792
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:43,278
subpopulation and these variance

793
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:45,440
phenotypes um so here I'm showing the

794
00:31:43,278 --> 00:31:47,839
principal components analysis of the GE

795
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:52,120
typic data the molecular marker data and

796
00:31:47,839 --> 00:31:55,720
we use K clusters to assign isolates to

797
00:31:52,119 --> 00:31:57,158
one of five clusters and then we

798
00:31:55,720 --> 00:32:01,120
regressed veillance on each IND

799
00:31:57,159 --> 00:32:03,919
individual pepper variety uh as as a

800
00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:06,439
function of their you know assignment to

801
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:08,480
those clusters and in most cases what we

802
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:11,320
found was that the genetic cell

803
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:13,000
population of isolate didn't really

804
00:32:11,319 --> 00:32:14,839
influence how much disease it can cause

805
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,398
on most of these pepper varieties with

806
00:32:14,839 --> 00:32:19,240
the exception of red and white the most

807
00:32:16,398 --> 00:32:21,119
susceptible pepper on average in our

808
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:23,359
experiment we started looking at

809
00:32:21,119 --> 00:32:27,759
multivariant F types and we saw we saw a

810
00:32:23,359 --> 00:32:30,038
very different uh uh conclusion

811
00:32:27,759 --> 00:32:30,038
excuse

812
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:37,799
me so this is the principal components

813
00:32:34,798 --> 00:32:41,480
analysis of the phenotypic data so the

814
00:32:37,798 --> 00:32:42,839
Matrix of disease outcome uh for all the

815
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:44,558
isolates and all of those different

816
00:32:42,839 --> 00:32:46,798
pepper

817
00:32:44,558 --> 00:32:48,678
accessies uh principal components one

818
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:51,000
and two explain most of the variation in

819
00:32:48,679 --> 00:32:52,639
our data set uh principal component one

820
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:54,558
was very highly correlated with just

821
00:32:52,638 --> 00:32:57,759
overall average Varin across all the

822
00:32:54,558 --> 00:33:01,678
pepper ex sessions that wasn't associ

823
00:32:57,759 --> 00:33:03,240
population principal component two uh

824
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:05,320
was very highly correlated with the

825
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:08,558
slope from that stability analysis so

826
00:33:05,319 --> 00:33:10,079
like the uh increase in virence as a

827
00:33:08,558 --> 00:33:12,038
function of pepper

828
00:33:10,079 --> 00:33:14,000
susceptibility also wasn't associated

829
00:33:12,038 --> 00:33:15,599
with subpopulation the principal

830
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,798
component three had a very strong

831
00:33:15,599 --> 00:33:20,079
association with P sub population and

832
00:33:17,798 --> 00:33:22,240
you can see here that along this

833
00:33:20,079 --> 00:33:24,158
x-axis denoting principal component

834
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:26,319
three uh you know all the isolates

835
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:28,440
belonging to genetic cluster the green

836
00:33:26,319 --> 00:33:30,638
cluster are fall on the left side of

837
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:32,320
that axis and all the isolates on the

838
00:33:30,638 --> 00:33:33,798
belonging to the the blue cluster fall

839
00:33:32,319 --> 00:33:36,278
on the right side of that

840
00:33:33,798 --> 00:33:37,879
axis this principal component is more

841
00:33:36,278 --> 00:33:41,240
difficult to interpret uh but if you

842
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:44,600
look at the loadings of the individual

843
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:47,558
uh pepper variety variance data on that

844
00:33:44,599 --> 00:33:49,038
principal component uh the way I

845
00:33:47,558 --> 00:33:52,038
interpret it I'm not sure if this is

846
00:33:49,038 --> 00:33:54,798
like correct but it's basically uh

847
00:33:52,038 --> 00:33:57,440
measuring how much disease the isolates

848
00:33:54,798 --> 00:34:01,480
cause on the intermediately resistant

849
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:03,720
pepper accessions uh controlled by their

850
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:06,200
um the disease causing the most

851
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:08,079
susceptible pepper excesss so if you

852
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:10,159
look at the individual plots belonging

853
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:12,519
to the isolates with the most extreme

854
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:15,240
values on that principal component so

855
00:34:12,519 --> 00:34:17,358
this would be that Green Dot over here

856
00:34:15,239 --> 00:34:19,959
and this isolate would be that blue dot

857
00:34:17,358 --> 00:34:21,838
over here you can see that that this

858
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:25,159
isolate causes lower than average

859
00:34:21,838 --> 00:34:27,440
disease and the most most resistant and

860
00:34:25,159 --> 00:34:29,119
most susceptible he

861
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:31,039
but much higher than average disease on

862
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:33,559
the intermediately resistant pepper

863
00:34:31,039 --> 00:34:35,279
varieties whereas this isolate causes

864
00:34:33,559 --> 00:34:37,119
higher than average disease on the most

865
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:39,560
susceptible and the most resistant

866
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:41,480
pepper variety but much lower than

867
00:34:39,559 --> 00:34:44,519
average disease on the intermediately

868
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:47,280
resistant pepper varieties uh I I think

869
00:34:44,519 --> 00:34:50,639
what this means is that there are uh

870
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:53,480
host specific virulence variants that

871
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:54,878
affect uh the disease observed on these

872
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:56,599
intermediately resistant pepper

873
00:34:54,878 --> 00:34:58,279
varieties but you can't really piece

874
00:34:56,599 --> 00:35:00,079
that out unless you control for much

875
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:02,240
larger effect variants affecting their

876
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:05,560
ability to cause disease on the most

877
00:35:02,239 --> 00:35:05,559
susceptible pepper

878
00:35:07,199 --> 00:35:11,799
EXs so you know like we do mag type and

879
00:35:10,159 --> 00:35:14,319
fungicide sensitivity we did a genome

880
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:16,119
white Association study we found four

881
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:18,599
Loi that were significantly associated

882
00:35:16,119 --> 00:35:20,720
with virulence in all cases these four

883
00:35:18,599 --> 00:35:25,200
Loi were associated with broad spectrum

884
00:35:20,719 --> 00:35:27,879
virulence so the the virent O at these

885
00:35:25,199 --> 00:35:29,319
lowside resulted in higher disease on

886
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:31,920
all of the pepper exceptions that we

887
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:34,160
tested uh we weren't able to map any

888
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:36,000
variants that affected disease on only

889
00:35:34,159 --> 00:35:38,559
individual pepper

890
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:41,679
EXs and when when we look at the genes

891
00:35:38,559 --> 00:35:43,358
in the regions of these hits uh we found

892
00:35:41,679 --> 00:35:45,759
annotations that kind of support a

893
00:35:43,358 --> 00:35:49,239
virulence function so these are kind of

894
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:52,040
close-ups of no manh plot Peaks and the

895
00:35:49,239 --> 00:35:55,598
track underneath shows um Gene

896
00:35:52,039 --> 00:36:00,519
anotations and Alterna colors uh the red

897
00:35:55,599 --> 00:36:02,280
genes are rxlr rxlr affector genes you

898
00:36:00,519 --> 00:36:05,039
can see that in case of the peak on

899
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:07,079
scaffold 39 the peak s was actually

900
00:36:05,039 --> 00:36:09,440
inside one of these effectors seems like

901
00:36:07,079 --> 00:36:12,880
pretty strong support that this you know

902
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:16,400
there's actual um AAL function for this

903
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:18,440
hit uh similar to SCA 37 although they

904
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:21,680
wer in the

905
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:24,720
gene um the purple sequences are

906
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:27,159
polycon uh Gene annotations so genes

907
00:36:24,719 --> 00:36:30,639
involved in cell wall degradation and in

908
00:36:27,159 --> 00:36:32,118
in the case of the in scaffold 93 we saw

909
00:36:30,639 --> 00:36:34,358
that there was a cluster of genes

910
00:36:32,119 --> 00:36:36,119
annotated having a

911
00:36:34,358 --> 00:36:38,279
polyglas uh

912
00:36:36,119 --> 00:36:40,358
role okay so what what's the make of

913
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:42,319
these results like it you know we

914
00:36:40,358 --> 00:36:44,199
generate a lot of data and like kind of

915
00:36:42,318 --> 00:36:46,838
scratched our heads and try to tell some

916
00:36:44,199 --> 00:36:49,000
story about it make sense of it uh what

917
00:36:46,838 --> 00:36:51,400
are the actual practical

918
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:53,599
implications I I think for one thing we

919
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:55,200
showed that you know GW works pretty

920
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:57,318
well for candidate Gene identification

921
00:36:55,199 --> 00:37:00,118
and sexually reproducing

922
00:36:57,318 --> 00:37:02,639
pathogens um we showed that both for the

923
00:37:00,119 --> 00:37:04,880
M type for the fungicide sensitivity and

924
00:37:02,639 --> 00:37:06,519
in the case of these larger effect VAR

925
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:09,240
slow side that affected all of the

926
00:37:06,519 --> 00:37:11,559
pepper accessions in our

927
00:37:09,239 --> 00:37:13,439
experiment you know other breeders and

928
00:37:11,559 --> 00:37:16,920
Pathologists use the terminology

929
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:20,318
physiological races to refer to phyto

930
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:21,639
capsy populations based on the set of

931
00:37:20,318 --> 00:37:23,759
isolates and the set of pepper

932
00:37:21,639 --> 00:37:25,400
accessions we included in our experiment

933
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:28,160
I'm not sure I would use that

934
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:30,280
terminology to me that implies like

935
00:37:28,159 --> 00:37:32,199
large effect qualitative Gene for Gene

936
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:34,400
interactions that influence the presence

937
00:37:32,199 --> 00:37:36,439
or absence of disease we saw evidence

938
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:38,200
for much smaller

939
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:39,960
quantitative uh Gene for Gene

940
00:37:38,199 --> 00:37:42,439
interactions that influence relative

941
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:44,440
disease levels on different varieties uh

942
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:47,559
I'm not sure what the best way is to

943
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:49,119
classify you know isolates or strains

944
00:37:47,559 --> 00:37:50,318
based on the data that we observed I

945
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:52,119
don't think there is an easy way to do

946
00:37:50,318 --> 00:37:53,679
it but physiological rases I think maybe

947
00:37:52,119 --> 00:37:55,240
some

948
00:37:53,679 --> 00:37:57,078
oversimplification that being said you

949
00:37:55,239 --> 00:37:59,279
know maybe with a different set of is

950
00:37:57,079 --> 00:38:02,318
different set of Po gen we would have

951
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:02,319
had different

952
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:08,519
conclusions so you know like I said we

953
00:38:05,838 --> 00:38:11,639
were able to identify virence variants

954
00:38:08,519 --> 00:38:14,679
with uh medium to large effect across

955
00:38:11,639 --> 00:38:16,000
all of the uh pepper hostar experiment

956
00:38:14,679 --> 00:38:18,078
but we couldn't really we knew that

957
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:20,119
there was there were variants that had

958
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:22,318
an effect on individual pepper varieties

959
00:38:20,119 --> 00:38:23,720
but we couldn't pick those out uh

960
00:38:22,318 --> 00:38:25,639
probably were just underpowered because

961
00:38:23,719 --> 00:38:28,000
of small know relatively small sample

962
00:38:25,639 --> 00:38:30,159
sizes

963
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,519
in terms of implications for pepper

964
00:38:30,159 --> 00:38:33,118
breeding you know if I was a pepper

965
00:38:31,519 --> 00:38:34,920
breeder what would I do knowing this

966
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:36,519
information I think I would just treat

967
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:38,480
the resistance to different strains like

968
00:38:36,519 --> 00:38:40,280
a correlated trait you know in terms of

969
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:42,318
screening early generation lines I'd

970
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:44,519
probably evaluate them against one

971
00:38:42,318 --> 00:38:46,358
isolate uh one strain of the pathogen

972
00:38:44,519 --> 00:38:48,079
and then as I move forward and and

973
00:38:46,358 --> 00:38:51,078
evaluate more advanced lines I would

974
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:53,200
test them against an increased number of

975
00:38:51,079 --> 00:38:55,079
isolates so how how am I going to take

976
00:38:53,199 --> 00:38:57,639
this like background and move forward as

977
00:38:55,079 --> 00:39:01,440
a eggplant and tomato Breer I'll try to

978
00:38:57,639 --> 00:39:03,960
do this in like two minutes um I think

979
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:07,519
it really just depends on a Case by case

980
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:08,800
basis uh so as an example tomato leaf

981
00:39:07,519 --> 00:39:11,000
mold is a disease that's really

982
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:12,880
important in our region in high tunnels

983
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:14,800
and it's also a disease that has been

984
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:18,039
very well characterized by molecular

985
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:20,039
plant Pathologists many R genes and a

986
00:39:18,039 --> 00:39:22,279
virulence Losi in in the fungus have

987
00:39:20,039 --> 00:39:23,838
been cloned here there's very strong

988
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:26,319
evidence of you know very clear

989
00:39:23,838 --> 00:39:28,159
qualitative Gene for Gene interactions

990
00:39:26,318 --> 00:39:30,079
uh I I worked a little bit on this as a

991
00:39:28,159 --> 00:39:32,879
grad student in a project led by my

992
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:35,200
labmate Martha sudman uh we characterize

993
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:38,000
isolates from around the state uh race

994
00:39:35,199 --> 00:39:40,639
type then we determined that everything

995
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:43,639
that we found were races zero and two

996
00:39:40,639 --> 00:39:45,519
tomato breeders tend to use one

997
00:39:43,639 --> 00:39:47,519

998
00:39:45,519 --> 00:39:49,079
breeding programs that works against

999
00:39:47,519 --> 00:39:50,880
those races so for the time being I

1000
00:39:49,079 --> 00:39:53,160
think uh resistance variety should hold

1001
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:55,400
up uh but I think it's also prudent to

1002
00:39:53,159 --> 00:39:57,440
maybe pyramid additional uh resistance

1003
00:39:55,400 --> 00:40:00,720
genes as well

1004
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:02,679
anticipating uh breakdown my predecessor

1005
00:40:00,719 --> 00:40:04,199
in my position Martha mler did a lot of

1006
00:40:02,679 --> 00:40:06,719
excellent work on early blight and

1007
00:40:04,199 --> 00:40:09,480
suboral leaf spot identified new sources

1008
00:40:06,719 --> 00:40:11,000
of resistance to these diseases um

1009
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:13,119
there's really nothing known about the

1010
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:14,400
population structure of the of the fungi

1011
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:16,760
that cause these diseases do they

1012
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:18,480
reproduce sexually how much variation is

1013
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:20,800
there between strains in the same field

1014
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:23,358
between Fields uh does the resistance

1015
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:24,920
hold them equally to different strains

1016
00:40:23,358 --> 00:40:26,400
uh there you know there's really a lot

1017
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:28,760
of unknowns and I think a lot of

1018
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:30,599
information that would be valuable there

1019
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:33,800
uh my lab is also working on vertican

1020
00:40:30,599 --> 00:40:36,760
Resistance um if you you know when when

1021
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:38,519
I ask eggplant uh Growers and extension

1022
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:41,280
agents what the biggest problem in

1023
00:40:38,519 --> 00:40:42,639
eggplant is if I ask 10 people they all

1024
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:44,680
tend to tell me the same thing which is

1025
00:40:42,639 --> 00:40:47,799
vertican which is good to hear as a

1026
00:40:44,679 --> 00:40:49,199
breeder so I can kind of focus um

1027
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:52,000
there's no resistance available to

1028
00:40:49,199 --> 00:40:53,919
vertican in eggplant in tomato vertican

1029
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:57,280
has been controlled for I don't know 50

1030
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:59,559
or 80 years with a single Gene uh ve

1031
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:01,880
that's been overcome in other parts of

1032
00:40:59,559 --> 00:41:05,799
the country uh we don't know if there's

1033
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:07,680
uh you know ve um uh strains that

1034
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:09,839
overcome ve in New York I think that's a

1035
00:41:07,679 --> 00:41:11,838
a valuable question to answer we also

1036
00:41:09,838 --> 00:41:14,318
don't know how much doesn't matter for

1037
00:41:11,838 --> 00:41:16,078
eggplant uh is there association between

1038
00:41:14,318 --> 00:41:18,119
Varin of eggplant variance of tomato I

1039
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:19,519
think there's important questions to

1040
00:41:18,119 --> 00:41:23,000
answer

1041
00:41:19,519 --> 00:41:24,480
there so to conclude you know uh as a

1042
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:26,559
vegetable breeder moving forward I don't

1043
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:29,240
think for every single disease I work on

1044
00:41:26,559 --> 00:41:31,559
I'm going to uh test you know my

1045
00:41:29,239 --> 00:41:34,479
breeding lines against 100 strains of of

1046
00:41:31,559 --> 00:41:37,119
the pathogen but I I think there are are

1047
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:38,920
some uh important lessons right like the

1048
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:40,960
scale and scope pathogen monitoring

1049
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:42,680
characterization depends on the

1050
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:45,480
particular case in the case of tomato

1051
00:41:42,679 --> 00:41:47,118
leaf mold it might be monitoring for for

1052
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:49,440
individual Avance genes that are already

1053
00:41:47,119 --> 00:41:53,039
cloned that we know will allow them to

1054
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:54,720
overtake that deployed Argin in the case

1055
00:41:53,039 --> 00:41:56,039
of septor and early BL I think there's

1056
00:41:54,719 --> 00:41:59,480
much more fundamental information that

1057
00:41:56,039 --> 00:42:01,559
need to be uncovered first uh I don't

1058
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:03,000
expect to do like any of this by myself

1059
00:42:01,559 --> 00:42:05,239
I really look forward to collaborating

1060
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:06,559
with Pathologists and another thing I'm

1061
00:42:05,239 --> 00:42:08,679
really interested in is you know

1062
00:42:06,559 --> 00:42:10,719
coordinating networks to test germ plasm

1063
00:42:08,679 --> 00:42:13,199
in geographically diverse locations

1064
00:42:10,719 --> 00:42:14,480
right because one thing we can do is do

1065
00:42:13,199 --> 00:42:16,318
artificial inoculations in the

1066
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:18,559
greenhouse with different strains of the

1067
00:42:16,318 --> 00:42:20,318
pathogen but we can also just test germ

1068
00:42:18,559 --> 00:42:22,279
Plasma in different locations and rely

1069
00:42:20,318 --> 00:42:27,639
natural inoculum and look at how durable

1070
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:28,880
resistance is um with that approach

1071
00:42:27,639 --> 00:42:30,838
so with that I'd like to thank all the

1072
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:32,720
people who contributed to my PhD

1073
00:42:30,838 --> 00:42:35,519
research that I talked about today as

1074
00:42:32,719 --> 00:42:38,519
well as uh the members of my lab

1075
00:42:35,519 --> 00:42:41,800
currently barene D young Cameron Downey

1076
00:42:38,519 --> 00:42:43,440
Howard rice and uh Lana Castillo so with

1077
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:45,440
that I'll be happy to answer any

1078
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:47,679
questions if if there's any time

1079
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:53,960
left question in the room here and then

1080
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:58,199
we'll go to uh yeah um back to by the RO

1081
00:42:53,960 --> 00:43:00,838
how much section will reproduction

1082
00:42:58,199 --> 00:43:03,838
occurs in the

1083
00:43:00,838 --> 00:43:06,078
field um pretty much in in so the

1084
00:43:03,838 --> 00:43:08,239
question for Zoom was uh how much sexual

1085
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:09,599
reproduction occurs in the field with

1086
00:43:08,239 --> 00:43:12,838
phyo

1087
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:14,480
capsy uh almost in every case when we

1088
00:43:12,838 --> 00:43:16,920
sample strains from the field we

1089
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:19,760
identify both mating types and the GE

1090
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:22,680
typic data also supports you know very

1091
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:25,319
frequent sexual reproduction so uh it

1092
00:43:22,679 --> 00:43:28,000
tends to be uh the case that both M

1093
00:43:25,318 --> 00:43:29,719
types are present it and sexual

1094
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:32,400
reproduction is necessary for over

1095
00:43:29,719 --> 00:43:34,000
wintering which which we see as

1096
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:40,240
well

1097
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:40,239
yes first off I want to say that graph

1098
00:43:40,358 --> 00:43:43,358
subx

1099
00:43:49,679 --> 00:43:58,078
results question isoss pepp Tes you have

1100
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:58,079
a sense of how much I

1101
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:08,000
uh so so thank you Adam the the question

1102
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:10,000
was um in the different pepper lines

1103
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:12,920
that we tested how much heter zygosity

1104
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:15,559
is present in those lines that's a good

1105
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:18,920
question so we used a mixture of

1106
00:44:15,559 --> 00:44:20,240
commercial hybrids and open pollinated

1107
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:23,119
pepper

1108
00:44:20,239 --> 00:44:27,118
varieties um the commercial hybrids

1109
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:30,119
should be you know pretty homogeneous um

1110
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:32,318
and we saw pretty consistent results in

1111
00:44:30,119 --> 00:44:34,440
some of the open pollinated varieties

1112
00:44:32,318 --> 00:44:36,318
that we included we did see more

1113
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:39,679
variable results and there could be some

1114
00:44:36,318 --> 00:44:42,960
heterogenity within those

1115
00:44:39,679 --> 00:44:46,440
yeah no there there are a couple

1116
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:48,559
questions question from Ricky do you

1117
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:50,519
think sparse testing methods would help

1118
00:44:48,559 --> 00:44:52,200
alleviate the experimental constraints

1119
00:44:50,519 --> 00:44:54,318
challenging all Gene types by all

1120
00:44:52,199 --> 00:44:55,719
isolates or do you think the level of

1121
00:44:54,318 --> 00:44:58,599
pathogen variation you observed will

1122
00:44:55,719 --> 00:45:01,838
feel hinder this that that's a that's a

1123
00:44:58,599 --> 00:45:04,880
really interesting question um and I

1124
00:45:01,838 --> 00:45:07,679
guess the answer is is yes

1125
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:10,800
um

1126
00:45:07,679 --> 00:45:14,480
uh that's not the way that we set up the

1127
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:16,359
experiment um but I think it is possible

1128
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:20,358
to like Leverage relationships between

1129
00:45:16,358 --> 00:45:23,799
the isolates to not necessarily F typ

1130
00:45:20,358 --> 00:45:27,318
all combinations but generate useful

1131
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:30,760
information um and then there's another

1132
00:45:27,318 --> 00:45:32,838
question uh and that is that when we've

1133
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:34,559
see the history of plant breeding

1134
00:45:32,838 --> 00:45:36,159
breeders have been pretty successful in

1135
00:45:34,559 --> 00:45:37,200
breeding for disease resistance even

1136
00:45:36,159 --> 00:45:39,239
though they have little knowledge of the

1137
00:45:37,199 --> 00:45:41,480
type of isense they're working with from

1138
00:45:39,239 --> 00:45:43,159
this can we conclude that they have been

1139
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:45,440
mostly selecting for broad spectrum

1140
00:45:43,159 --> 00:45:47,879
resistance and how does this interaction

1141
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:51,159
carry over in time that's that's a great

1142
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:53,838
question too um and I I think I would

1143
00:45:51,159 --> 00:45:56,440
say that that there are many cases of

1144
00:45:53,838 --> 00:45:58,480
breeders deploying a resistance

1145
00:45:56,440 --> 00:46:00,480
Gene and that resistance Gene lasting

1146
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:02,000
for decades but there are also many

1147
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:03,920
cases of breeders deploying a gene and

1148
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:06,039
it lasting a year or two right I think

1149
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:08,680
both of those things have have been

1150
00:46:06,039 --> 00:46:11,558
observed

1151
00:46:08,679 --> 00:46:13,318
um well the last question is from uh

1152
00:46:11,559 --> 00:46:15,280
Marina can you elaborate a little on

1153
00:46:13,318 --> 00:46:17,239
possible Pros or cons of using scaffold

1154
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:20,319
level sequences for Goos rather than

1155
00:46:17,239 --> 00:46:22,118
chromosomal level uh if you know if if

1156
00:46:20,318 --> 00:46:25,239
we had chromosome

1157
00:46:22,119 --> 00:46:28,200
level uh assembly that would be

1158
00:46:25,239 --> 00:46:31,318
preferable it's it's it's visually it's

1159
00:46:28,199 --> 00:46:33,439
nicer and then we can also identify uh

1160
00:46:31,318 --> 00:46:34,880
you know whether different hits are are

1161
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:38,200
linked on the same

1162
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:39,960
chromosome uh it's very hard with with

1163
00:46:38,199 --> 00:46:41,358
many very small scaffolds that that

1164
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:43,199
could actually be physically or

1165
00:46:41,358 --> 00:46:46,279
genetically very closely

1166
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:49,598
linked um and I guess that's it for the

1167
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:53,559
questions oh build might Happ um is

1168
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:53,559
there no sexual reproduction in the

1169
00:46:53,719 --> 00:46:58,480
B is there

1170
00:46:56,519 --> 00:47:02,119
that yeah that's is there sexual

1171
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:05,199
reproduction in the Geneva phyo farm so

1172
00:47:02,119 --> 00:47:07,358
uh yes uh you know Chris in the past has

1173
00:47:05,199 --> 00:47:10,558
intentionally inoculated that field with

1174
00:47:07,358 --> 00:47:12,159
with multiple mating types with the

1175
00:47:10,559 --> 00:47:13,800
intention of really studying you know

1176
00:47:12,159 --> 00:47:16,759
how Le frequencies change over time and

1177
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:20,160
a sexually repr reproducing population

1178
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:23,040
but for field trials we we intend to

1179
00:47:20,159 --> 00:47:25,759
inoculate only with one mating type

1180
00:47:23,039 --> 00:47:27,599
hoping not to contribute to uh you know

1181
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:31,800
long lasting populations so in those

1182
00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:33,720
trials there's no resal population that

1183
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:36,640
that is the Hope but you

1184
00:47:33,719 --> 00:47:38,480
know for all of our best efforts to

1185
00:47:36,639 --> 00:47:43,000
contain pathogens they they find a way

1186
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:45,639
to spread around um yeah I have one more

1187
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:47,760
question yes in that massive study

1188
00:47:45,639 --> 00:47:53,279
looking at the range of isos over the

1189
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:55,440
several posts how stable are those

1190
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:56,680
or that that's that's an excellent

1191
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:57,920
question and I apologize for not

1192
00:47:56,679 --> 00:47:59,838
repeating the earlier questions the

1193
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:02,240
question was how stable were the

1194
00:47:59,838 --> 00:48:04,119
phenotypes uh uh the aggressiveness

1195
00:48:02,239 --> 00:48:05,519
levels of the isolates that that's

1196
00:48:04,119 --> 00:48:07,599
that's a really good question and one

1197
00:48:05,519 --> 00:48:10,400
that I didn't talk about

1198
00:48:07,599 --> 00:48:12,559
um what we what we found generally was

1199
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:15,000
that the lowly and the kind of

1200
00:48:12,559 --> 00:48:18,200
intermediately aggressive isolates were

1201
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:20,280
stable uh across you know different uh

1202
00:48:18,199 --> 00:48:22,279
replicates but the isolates that tended

1203
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:24,040
to cause very high levels of disease on

1204
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:26,200
all of the pepper sessions those were

1205
00:48:24,039 --> 00:48:29,079
the least stable

1206
00:48:26,199 --> 00:48:31,358
um you know we would inoculate with a

1207
00:48:29,079 --> 00:48:35,680
strain and we would see you know very

1208
00:48:31,358 --> 00:48:38,358
severe uh you know plant uh death we've

1209
00:48:35,679 --> 00:48:40,318
be able to repeat that maybe a few times

1210
00:48:38,358 --> 00:48:44,400
um and then it would just would lose its

1211
00:48:40,318 --> 00:48:46,279
its veilance uh it's you know it's I

1212
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:49,200
think there's a lot

1213
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:51,119
of spontaneous variation like that in

1214
00:48:49,199 --> 00:48:52,358
phyo species and we heard a little bit

1215
00:48:51,119 --> 00:48:54,720
about that last week in terms of

1216
00:48:52,358 --> 00:48:55,838
fungicide sensitivity uh as well from

1217
00:48:54,719 --> 00:48:59,118
from syvia I think there's lot of

1218
00:48:55,838 --> 00:49:00,599
interesting questions there yeah so we

1219
00:48:59,119 --> 00:49:02,519
want to thank you again Greg for an

1220
00:49:00,599 --> 00:49:04,720
excellent presentation

1221
00:49:02,519 --> 00:49:07,000
and just look forward to working with

1222
00:49:04,719 --> 00:49:07,000
you

1223
00:49:09,639 --> 00:49:15,400
than this has been a production of

1224
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:18,400
Cornell University on the web at
