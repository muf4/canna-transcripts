1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,810
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:08,529
University

3
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:12,280
okay what is that great honor to be here

4
00:00:08,529 --> 00:00:16,179
today and thank you for joining me and I

5
00:00:12,279 --> 00:00:18,309
hope you enjoy my I talk and so today we

6
00:00:16,179 --> 00:00:21,309
talked about suppression of the awesome

7
00:00:18,309 --> 00:00:24,250
you system and how instead the microbe

8
00:00:21,309 --> 00:00:26,109
in fact arose take control now I would

9
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:29,050
like to give you a brief introduction

10
00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:32,229
about an immune system and you can see

11
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:34,870
here different pathogens and they're

12
00:00:32,229 --> 00:00:37,779
trying to attack the plant cells and

13
00:00:34,869 --> 00:00:40,238
possibly to gather nutrients on the

14
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:44,200
other part we have our plant cells that

15
00:00:40,238 --> 00:00:46,869
during the coevolution develop strategy

16
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:50,320
to first recognize these pathogens and

17
00:00:46,869 --> 00:00:54,339
then to perfectly give a defense

18
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:56,950
responses and these rely on the plant

19
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:59,950
immune system and we can divide these

20
00:00:56,950 --> 00:01:03,100
plant immune system two major layers one

21
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:07,240
is called a PT I am trigger immunity and

22
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:11,769
it relies on a surface receptor kinase

23
00:01:07,239 --> 00:01:15,039
called PR R pattern recognition receptor

24
00:01:11,769 --> 00:01:18,968
this receptor can perceive concern

25
00:01:15,039 --> 00:01:21,429
molecule from pathogens these are called

26
00:01:18,968 --> 00:01:24,548
pumps pathogen associate molecular

27
00:01:21,429 --> 00:01:28,240
patterns now when this receptor like

28
00:01:24,549 --> 00:01:30,670
ethyl is to recognize flagellum will

29
00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:34,748
first associate with a co-receptor

30
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:37,569
for example back 1 and which is a is

31
00:01:34,748 --> 00:01:41,228
required for the signaling and this will

32
00:01:37,569 --> 00:01:44,228
follow a calcium elevation followed by a

33
00:01:41,228 --> 00:01:47,200
rose production rose are reactive oxygen

34
00:01:44,228 --> 00:01:49,569
species like hydrogen peroxide and the

35
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,819
antigen peroxide will oxidize all the

36
00:01:49,569 --> 00:01:55,748
membrane and cause cell death so the

37
00:01:51,819 --> 00:01:57,069
pathogen cannot spread and for many of

38
00:01:55,748 --> 00:02:02,048
the pathogens is the end of their

39
00:01:57,069 --> 00:02:04,719
journey but also bacteria koval with the

40
00:02:02,049 --> 00:02:08,500
plants and then they develop different

41
00:02:04,718 --> 00:02:11,709
strategies like effector molecules this

42
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:15,659
molecule are translocated directly

43
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:16,790
inside the cell and they can manipulate

44
00:02:15,659 --> 00:02:19,218
interfere

45
00:02:16,789 --> 00:02:22,098
with the PTI so we don't have anymore

46
00:02:19,218 --> 00:02:24,378
the Ross production and here we have the

47
00:02:22,098 --> 00:02:27,289
second layer of plan immune system

48
00:02:24,378 --> 00:02:32,060
called ETI and we have another class of

49
00:02:27,289 --> 00:02:34,608
receptor also known as resistant

50
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:37,250
proteins thinking specifically recognize

51
00:02:34,609 --> 00:02:40,489
effector molecule and trigger the ETI

52
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:44,780
effective effector to immunity which is

53
00:02:40,489 --> 00:02:46,908
a faster stronger response now you can

54
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:50,628
see these are different kind of audience

55
00:02:46,908 --> 00:02:53,810
and you have a bacterium nematodes

56
00:02:50,628 --> 00:02:56,298
fungus and it's also nice to see that we

57
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:59,719
have this effort system fitting these

58
00:02:56,299 --> 00:03:03,889
models and this is a new entry this is a

59
00:02:59,719 --> 00:03:06,829
recent concept of f it secretin

60
00:03:03,889 --> 00:03:07,840
effectors to moduli to modulate the

61
00:03:06,829 --> 00:03:14,030
plant Aust

62
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:16,340
so what are these effectors so effectors

63
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:19,430
are molecule produced by pathogen that

64
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:22,039
modify or small area behavior to enable

65
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:24,139
porosity and we have different kind of

66
00:03:22,039 --> 00:03:26,900
effectors for example apple plastic

67
00:03:24,139 --> 00:03:29,349
effectors these are secreted to the O's

68
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:31,780
extracellular space and they can target

69
00:03:29,348 --> 00:03:35,378
those proteases

70
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:38,568
we have also cytoplasmic effectors and

71
00:03:35,378 --> 00:03:41,959
these effectors trans okay the inside

72
00:03:38,568 --> 00:03:44,988
cell and can suppress or otherwise many

73
00:03:41,959 --> 00:03:47,030
plate loss processes now

74
00:03:44,989 --> 00:03:50,299
characterization of molecule functions

75
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:52,489
or effectors provide key information for

76
00:03:50,299 --> 00:03:54,769
understanding processes underlying plant

77
00:03:52,489 --> 00:03:57,019
colonization by pathogens and this is

78
00:03:54,769 --> 00:03:59,539
but what I'm doing with my research I'm

79
00:03:57,019 --> 00:04:03,069
trying to functionally characterize a

80
00:03:59,539 --> 00:04:09,198
factor from different part of system now

81
00:04:03,068 --> 00:04:12,138
let's go back and this is my little bit

82
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:14,569
of my background so I tell my bachelor

83
00:04:12,139 --> 00:04:19,250
master degree in plant biology in Turin

84
00:04:14,568 --> 00:04:22,939
and in Italy and after that I did my

85
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:25,430
study in in England in Norwich and here

86
00:04:22,939 --> 00:04:27,769
is try to expand my research topic and I

87
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:30,230
was studying plant inside interaction

88
00:04:27,769 --> 00:04:35,509
and more recently I

89
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:37,910
here in the US at USDA race and my study

90
00:04:35,509 --> 00:04:41,329
was were focusing on a plant inks at

91
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:46,100
microbe interaction and now at UF I'm

92
00:04:41,329 --> 00:04:49,159
also trying to develop tools in order to

93
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:51,500
solve a recurrent problem and I'm also

94
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:57,530
interested in interaction between fungus

95
00:04:51,500 --> 00:05:01,459
in an inset so after my studying touring

96
00:04:57,529 --> 00:05:05,329
I went in Norwich and here they have a

97
00:05:01,459 --> 00:05:07,699
really nice research park and for

98
00:05:05,329 --> 00:05:10,490
example this is a genomic analysis

99
00:05:07,699 --> 00:05:14,599
Center we have the central laboratory

100
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:16,400
and the John Innes Centre and I was able

101
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:19,220
to establish a collaboration between a

102
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:24,259
university of turin and the jimenez

103
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:26,870
center and here i was we were trying to

104
00:05:24,259 --> 00:05:30,829
functionally characterize effector

105
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:33,800
protein from 12 it - Percy and diesel

106
00:05:30,829 --> 00:05:36,649
and here is a TM picture from an episode

107
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:40,670
and you can see it is a peculiar mouth

108
00:05:36,649 --> 00:05:43,039
part now for a plant pathogen to be

109
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:45,410
successful manipulation of how cell

110
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:47,390
processes to promote violence is a sting

111
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:51,890
shot which is achieved by the secretion

112
00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:54,439
of molecule terminal factors and to do

113
00:05:51,889 --> 00:05:56,300
that we use this a novel approach based

114
00:05:54,439 --> 00:05:59,569
on a combination of bioinformatics and

115
00:05:56,300 --> 00:06:03,470
functional si si to identify factors

116
00:05:59,569 --> 00:06:06,709
from my dispersion and these are how we

117
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:10,880
identify these effectors so we start

118
00:06:06,709 --> 00:06:14,479
with the es T's seller grant from my

119
00:06:10,879 --> 00:06:18,009
dispersion then we look for protein

120
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:20,870
contain a signal peptide signal peptide

121
00:06:18,009 --> 00:06:23,629
tends to the cell to translate outside

122
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:25,610
the protein and then we remove all the

123
00:06:23,629 --> 00:06:29,810
protein with the transmembrane domain so

124
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:33,230
we want a protein attack a move and we

125
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:36,769
finish to identify 46 candidate

126
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:38,600
effectors so this one of the functional

127
00:06:36,769 --> 00:06:42,289
analysis we need to characterize these

128
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:44,060
effectors and so we overspreads this

129
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:46,580
candidate in Nicosia Romanian

130
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:48,980
and then we cut leaf discs and use it as

131
00:06:46,579 --> 00:06:52,819
acrylic plate and then we add the four

132
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:56,210
means each leaf disc and then we count

133
00:06:52,819 --> 00:06:59,389
the number of names produced and one

134
00:06:56,209 --> 00:07:01,399
effect or NPC or to increase the number

135
00:06:59,389 --> 00:07:04,129
of the names when they were feeding on

136
00:07:01,399 --> 00:07:06,679
this plant so he may in indicated these

137
00:07:04,129 --> 00:07:10,219
products in important on the plantings

138
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:12,790
and interaction we also have two and p10

139
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:16,220
mp40 two that actually decrees the

140
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:18,379
numbers of name produced and we also

141
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:22,400
found that MP 10 he's actually using

142
00:07:18,379 --> 00:07:25,850
claw rosa and a week sell that but also

143
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:28,429
he can suppress PTI and used by pamphlet

144
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:31,010
jelly and is a quiet contradiction of

145
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:33,800
observation right so the hypothesis is

146
00:07:31,009 --> 00:07:35,599
them always pressure on an MP 10 is

147
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:38,870
actually triggering some plant defense

148
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:42,080
responses and perhaps in a normal

149
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:44,840
athlete plan interaction other effector

150
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:46,849
are suppressing these response and MP 10

151
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:51,049
cannot contribute to the barians by

152
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:53,900
suppressing the PTI now there is another

153
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:59,000
way to functionally characterize gene

154
00:07:53,899 --> 00:08:00,409
function and is using an RNA silencing

155
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:04,639
so we can knock down the gene expression

156
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:08,630
of genes so all these are interference

157
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:11,029
works so if we know the sequence of our

158
00:08:08,629 --> 00:08:14,449
name is danger we can a synthesize

159
00:08:11,029 --> 00:08:16,489
double seller name and then deliver to

160
00:08:14,449 --> 00:08:19,370
their cells which will recognize this

161
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:21,829
double star on a using dice enzyme we

162
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:24,709
will chop the double array in small

163
00:08:21,829 --> 00:08:29,329
interference RNA and then with complex

164
00:08:24,709 --> 00:08:33,529
with risk which will identify the

165
00:08:29,329 --> 00:08:36,918
corresponding messenger RNA and block

166
00:08:33,529 --> 00:08:39,860
the prescription now at that time there

167
00:08:36,918 --> 00:08:44,289
were two system for double sonoran

168
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:49,220
delivery was a the injection or

169
00:08:44,289 --> 00:08:51,679
artificial diet but both system have

170
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:55,040
some drawbacks for example you need an

171
00:08:51,679 --> 00:08:57,870
injector you need to make glass needles

172
00:08:55,039 --> 00:09:01,439
you need to produce double

173
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:03,060
and also for the artificial lights you

174
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,960
need to optimize the dial for the

175
00:09:03,059 --> 00:09:09,000
efforts need to replace the diet because

176
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:15,600
contamination and bothered are in

177
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:18,330
artificial condition so I decide to use

178
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:20,070
a different system and I use this vector

179
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:23,040
that's allowed this pressure on double

180
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:26,400
surname implants so I generate

181
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:29,309
transgenic Arabidopsis expressing double

182
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:31,588
sorry to target a few genes and I also

183
00:09:29,309 --> 00:09:36,000
use a transient expression using a

184
00:09:31,589 --> 00:09:38,430
nicotine nicotine amine tamiana and I

185
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:42,870
want to show you the results using a

186
00:09:38,429 --> 00:09:46,889
transient expression so we select two

187
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:49,110
genes one mp0 from saliva gland is the

188
00:09:46,889 --> 00:09:52,199
gene that increased the night names when

189
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:57,120
the EF it fitted unknown of expression

190
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:59,310
plant in a gut protein we want to see if

191
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:03,149
the signal was able to move from the gut

192
00:09:59,309 --> 00:10:05,969
and as a salaried LAN and this is the

193
00:10:03,149 --> 00:10:10,559
results who's in the leaf disk I showed

194
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:12,570
you before and he's after 17 days of f/8

195
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:15,750
feeding on this plant expressing double

196
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:18,629
sorry you can see we can suppress the

197
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:20,879
gene expression of both genes and these

198
00:10:18,629 --> 00:10:22,529
are almost 50% which is similar to the

199
00:10:20,879 --> 00:10:24,960
amount of silence and you can get with

200
00:10:22,529 --> 00:10:27,899
double with the injection and with the

201
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:30,889
feeding on artificial diet these are a

202
00:10:27,899 --> 00:10:33,600
feed feeding on a double strand RNA and

203
00:10:30,889 --> 00:10:36,210
this is the fecundity results we found

204
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:39,810
that silencing NPC ought to reduce the

205
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:41,970
number on in produce so if you're over

206
00:10:39,809 --> 00:10:45,109
spreads this gene increase the number of

207
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:47,519
death names if you sinus this gene you

208
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:51,120
decrease the number of the names

209
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:53,870
produced and this Iraq is the gut

210
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:56,370
protein so we think that it may be

211
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:58,740
important for up taking natural so by

212
00:10:56,370 --> 00:11:01,950
silencing then we have a less natural

213
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:05,100
uptake and that will decrease the

214
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:08,610
fecundity so these are northern blot

215
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:11,459
using the leaf tissue and we are

216
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:14,308
expressing double our array in plants

217
00:11:11,458 --> 00:11:17,599
but we can detect a small interfering

218
00:11:14,308 --> 00:11:20,759
RNA so this is the Leafs tissue from

219
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:23,069
plant expressing double sonora 4mp co2

220
00:11:20,759 --> 00:11:25,619
and this frog rock so as I told you

221
00:11:23,068 --> 00:11:28,860
before the fan recognized doubles RNA

222
00:11:25,619 --> 00:11:31,410
and chopped in small interfering RNA so

223
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:37,009
the F it is actually up taking more

224
00:11:31,409 --> 00:11:41,549
interference RNA and this was a quite

225
00:11:37,009 --> 00:11:44,068
system that I developed to have a easy

226
00:11:41,549 --> 00:11:47,818
way to deliver double sonare and I

227
00:11:44,068 --> 00:11:49,769
didn't expect the Ben later this system

228
00:11:47,818 --> 00:11:55,019
was actually used not only an aphid on

229
00:11:49,769 --> 00:11:56,879
but another he said species but also it

230
00:11:55,019 --> 00:12:01,678
can be used as a tool for infant

231
00:11:56,879 --> 00:12:06,360
management now we were also interested

232
00:12:01,678 --> 00:12:09,149
in see if these Fe defectors have adapt

233
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:11,550
to modulate processes in a specific

234
00:12:09,149 --> 00:12:14,299
plant species so we have a generalist

235
00:12:11,549 --> 00:12:17,188
effort like - perception and we have a

236
00:12:14,299 --> 00:12:20,099
specialist evidence like a piece we can

237
00:12:17,188 --> 00:12:21,899
fit on your leg you so we generate

238
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:27,209
transgenic plant expressing my

239
00:12:21,899 --> 00:12:29,458
dispersion factors in transgenic plant

240
00:12:27,208 --> 00:12:32,028
expressing a pidgin orthologs

241
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:35,849
and anyway the deaf equality essay on

242
00:12:32,028 --> 00:12:38,159
honourable OPS's and so these are we

243
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:40,798
work so we add the adults on the plant

244
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:43,409
then we wait for new name so we can

245
00:12:40,798 --> 00:12:46,528
synchronize the age of the names and

246
00:12:43,409 --> 00:12:49,499
then we catch them again and then we

247
00:12:46,528 --> 00:12:53,308
wait for 16 days and we count the number

248
00:12:49,499 --> 00:12:58,230
of the names produced and these are is

249
00:12:53,308 --> 00:13:01,499
the results so my dispersion effect or

250
00:12:58,230 --> 00:13:03,329
promote fertility images per second only

251
00:13:01,499 --> 00:13:05,909
when they are feeding on plant

252
00:13:03,328 --> 00:13:09,088
expressing my suspense which affect us

253
00:13:05,909 --> 00:13:13,558
not when they are feeding on a pigeon or

254
00:13:09,089 --> 00:13:15,600
tall herbs and we reveal that there is a

255
00:13:13,558 --> 00:13:17,698
high nonsynonymous versus anonymous

256
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:19,980
nucleotide substitution rates with the

257
00:13:17,698 --> 00:13:22,438
effector dogs so indicating the

258
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:24,149
defectors in my dispersion are fast

259
00:13:22,438 --> 00:13:25,110
evolving as a consequence of

260
00:13:24,149 --> 00:13:27,179
evolutionary

261
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:29,820
sure which dries rapid is

262
00:13:27,179 --> 00:13:33,269
diversification on a vector function to

263
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:38,760
improve function when they are secreted

264
00:13:33,269 --> 00:13:43,429
in the cell or for escaping the

265
00:13:38,759 --> 00:13:46,049
recognition my plan immune system and

266
00:13:43,429 --> 00:13:48,299
this is the last work we did with

267
00:13:46,049 --> 00:13:51,328
efforts and at the beginning I show you

268
00:13:48,299 --> 00:13:53,399
that one day earliest physiological

269
00:13:51,328 --> 00:13:56,699
response to pump is a calcium elevation

270
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:58,708
and we found that if it feed inside

271
00:13:56,700 --> 00:14:00,778
triggered these calcium elevation is a

272
00:13:58,708 --> 00:14:03,539
transgenic plant expressed a biomarker

273
00:14:00,778 --> 00:14:06,750
that binds calcium and is the site of

274
00:14:03,539 --> 00:14:09,929
the figure they feed inside of every now

275
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:11,909
we didn't see calcium elevation when we

276
00:14:09,929 --> 00:14:14,939
use a transgenic plant expressing this

277
00:14:11,909 --> 00:14:17,689
biomarker in the phloem so only when the

278
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:21,089
F it was the problem in the mesophyll

279
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:23,519
and we found that this castle in

280
00:14:21,089 --> 00:14:25,649
elevation is a bad one dependent back

281
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:28,350
one is the chorus scepter required for

282
00:14:25,649 --> 00:14:30,179
signaling this is a is a back one mutant

283
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:34,050
we don't have anymore the calcium

284
00:14:30,179 --> 00:14:36,809
elevation and also there is a bachelor I

285
00:14:34,049 --> 00:14:39,838
on China tpc one that contribute to the

286
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:42,268
to the calcium elevation and this is a

287
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:47,250
mutant for the tpc one and we have a

288
00:14:42,269 --> 00:14:49,709
lower calcium concentration but if we

289
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:52,289
use a TP c 1 overreaction with a burst

290
00:14:49,708 --> 00:14:55,799
of calcium that can actually we use a

291
00:14:52,289 --> 00:15:01,889
fake unity say on this plan and reduce

292
00:14:55,799 --> 00:15:04,609
the aphid performance so if it trigger

293
00:15:01,889 --> 00:15:08,399
calcium elevation during probing of

294
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:11,190
epidermal Amazo fuel cell and saliva

295
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:13,528
which contain effectors RC is secreted

296
00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:17,670
into the cell types different cell types

297
00:15:13,528 --> 00:15:21,809
and it can actually suppress the feeding

298
00:15:17,669 --> 00:15:24,179
site of calcium elevation in most cells

299
00:15:21,809 --> 00:15:28,139
along the stylet pathway are unsure

300
00:15:24,179 --> 00:15:30,479
entry celery and we know that the cellar

301
00:15:28,139 --> 00:15:33,120
puncture by using the letter electrical

302
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:36,180
penetration graph and you can see here

303
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:37,470
there is a Hafidh wired and now this is

304
00:15:36,179 --> 00:15:38,669
a part of the circuit

305
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:42,269
so when

306
00:15:38,669 --> 00:15:45,479
efforts are probing with a stylet we

307
00:15:42,269 --> 00:15:48,210
generate a signal which is converted in

308
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:49,830
a waveforms and this way for

309
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:53,100
corresponding corresponds to a

310
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:56,759
particular feeding behavior for example

311
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:59,220
PD is a potential drop when then they

312
00:15:56,759 --> 00:16:04,620
stylet function the cell you wanna eat

313
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:07,680
you is a is when they this stylet reach

314
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:12,929
the phloem and start feeding so you can

315
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:17,969
see benefit ensure many epidermis amazed

316
00:16:12,929 --> 00:16:20,969
filled cell so this is the model now if

317
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:23,670
it similar to plant pathogens inject

318
00:16:20,970 --> 00:16:27,060
protein into host plants to manipulate

319
00:16:23,669 --> 00:16:30,569
all cell process enabling successful

320
00:16:27,059 --> 00:16:33,509
infestation of plant and here is a cell

321
00:16:30,570 --> 00:17:07,559
with stylet and syllabic antenna factors

322
00:16:33,509 --> 00:17:11,160
you can modulate the PGI response okay I

323
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:13,198
don't know so concluding remarks so in

324
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:16,380
our world provides important evidence

325
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:18,480
that herbivores inks it similar to plant

326
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:20,699
pathogenic microbes secrete defector

327
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:23,069
inside host cells the internet most

328
00:17:20,699 --> 00:17:26,670
protein a modified their activity to

329
00:17:23,069 --> 00:17:30,119
facilitate infestation so this was my

330
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:34,430
work during my PhD and after that I

331
00:17:30,119 --> 00:17:38,219
moved to here in u.s. in Florida and

332
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:41,070
first with the USDA error s and our UF

333
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:43,049
I'm trying to conduct research to

334
00:17:41,069 --> 00:17:47,039
develop and transfer solution to solve

335
00:17:43,049 --> 00:17:49,500
agree agriculture problem and so how do

336
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:52,440
we transfer basic principle to disease

337
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:55,740
management programs how can we come

338
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:59,129
for vector using sustainable system how

339
00:17:55,740 --> 00:18:00,419
can we reduce the economic impact caused

340
00:17:59,128 --> 00:18:03,990
by plant disease

341
00:18:00,419 --> 00:18:06,960
how do minimize the input and maximize

342
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:11,179
output and so I want to show you a

343
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:14,038
screening I developed to identify

344
00:18:11,179 --> 00:18:16,769
citrus-like susceptible to conquer

345
00:18:14,038 --> 00:18:19,829
disease this is a canker disease and as

346
00:18:16,769 --> 00:18:21,960
a is a caused by these bacteria Santa

347
00:18:19,829 --> 00:18:25,699
monitors and these are the symptoms on

348
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:27,419
leaves and on fruits now we know that

349
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:30,899
during the pti

350
00:18:27,419 --> 00:18:33,179
plant cells using the PR r receptor like

351
00:18:30,898 --> 00:18:37,969
a Phyllis - can recognize flagellum and

352
00:18:33,179 --> 00:18:42,570
start the PDI but we can also use a

353
00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:44,460
peptide called a flex flagellum 22 so we

354
00:18:42,569 --> 00:18:48,960
don't need to use the living bacteria

355
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:50,879
use a peptide and this will trigger the

356
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:54,360
same pti response with the Ross

357
00:18:50,878 --> 00:18:56,638
production so because that I designed

358
00:18:54,359 --> 00:19:00,359
these screaming and I show you how it

359
00:18:56,638 --> 00:19:04,349
works so like we can we take leave this

360
00:19:00,359 --> 00:19:07,619
from citrus plants and then we use this

361
00:19:04,349 --> 00:19:10,019
96 place we put the leaf disc on this 96

362
00:19:07,619 --> 00:19:12,079
place plus the flattening these are the

363
00:19:10,019 --> 00:19:14,370
list of the trigger hydrogen peroxide

364
00:19:12,079 --> 00:19:16,648
and we can compare this addition

365
00:19:14,369 --> 00:19:19,349
peroxide in a signal and this is the end

366
00:19:16,648 --> 00:19:23,638
result and you can see that really quick

367
00:19:19,349 --> 00:19:26,209
is quick response after a few minutes we

368
00:19:23,638 --> 00:19:28,678
can measure the hydrogen peroxide and

369
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:31,379
then we have a peak and then he goes to

370
00:19:28,679 --> 00:19:34,970
basic level but what's interesting is

371
00:19:31,378 --> 00:19:39,480
that we have different level of Ross

372
00:19:34,970 --> 00:19:42,929
production and I found that citrus more

373
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:45,899
susceptible to citrus canker produce low

374
00:19:42,929 --> 00:19:48,419
amount of Ross why plant less

375
00:19:45,898 --> 00:19:52,878
susceptible to c2 skunker produce high

376
00:19:48,419 --> 00:19:57,210
concentration of rose and so I screener

377
00:19:52,878 --> 00:20:00,480
hundreds of citrus this is a cattle

378
00:19:57,210 --> 00:20:02,639
ranchers roses is a sour orange and then

379
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:05,548
a separate planned with high rose

380
00:20:02,638 --> 00:20:06,209
production implant with the lower rows

381
00:20:05,548 --> 00:20:08,730
production

382
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:11,509
and then I in fact this plan we live in

383
00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:15,319
bacteria and a high Ross production

384
00:20:11,509 --> 00:20:18,118
corresponding to lower conclusion and

385
00:20:15,319 --> 00:20:19,259
with love Ross production correspond to

386
00:20:18,118 --> 00:20:22,589
high

387
00:20:19,259 --> 00:20:25,470
anchor illusion II so with this system

388
00:20:22,589 --> 00:20:27,658
live pathogen is substitute with the

389
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:31,048
flagellum peptide particular when the

390
00:20:27,659 --> 00:20:32,669
pathogen is regulated and is a rapid

391
00:20:31,048 --> 00:20:36,079
method for identified sitter sitting

392
00:20:32,669 --> 00:20:38,580
less to settle to Santa Monica tree and

393
00:20:36,079 --> 00:20:41,819
you don't need to propagate plans for

394
00:20:38,579 --> 00:20:44,819
pathogenicity test and now this system

395
00:20:41,819 --> 00:20:49,710
is implemented in situ hybrid selection

396
00:20:44,819 --> 00:20:51,778
I USDA for peers now this system allows

397
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:54,600
you to identify plan that are less

398
00:20:51,778 --> 00:20:59,368
susceptible but we have some cities they

399
00:20:54,599 --> 00:21:01,949
are normally very susceptible so it

400
00:20:59,368 --> 00:21:05,939
don't they don't produce high browse so

401
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:09,569
how can we improve the tolerance the

402
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:12,649
resistant of this plant so in this case

403
00:21:09,569 --> 00:21:16,378
we use the transgenic stools so we took

404
00:21:12,648 --> 00:21:18,268
the floods effortless to PRRS scepter

405
00:21:16,378 --> 00:21:20,308
from an e-coat elementary jana and we

406
00:21:18,269 --> 00:21:23,009
generate transgenic sweet orange with

407
00:21:20,308 --> 00:21:27,450
orange usually produce with lower rows

408
00:21:23,009 --> 00:21:30,089
using a flagellum 22 and these are the

409
00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:33,450
results so transgenic plant is pressing

410
00:21:30,089 --> 00:21:35,368
Nikitina been tamiana efflux to as a

411
00:21:33,450 --> 00:21:40,350
high ross compared to the contour and

412
00:21:35,368 --> 00:21:43,439
these again after infection with living

413
00:21:40,349 --> 00:21:46,528
bacteria caused less lesion on the

414
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:48,028
leaves so of expression of Nicotiana

415
00:21:46,528 --> 00:21:53,788
phyllis to in transgenic citrus

416
00:21:48,028 --> 00:21:56,278
increased conquer resistance now i will

417
00:21:53,788 --> 00:21:58,980
switch to another citrus disease and

418
00:21:56,278 --> 00:22:02,909
this is call citizen graham beam it

419
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:04,618
shall be or citrus greening disease this

420
00:22:02,909 --> 00:22:06,929
is the one of the most destructive

421
00:22:04,618 --> 00:22:09,569
disease of citrus worldwide and is

422
00:22:06,929 --> 00:22:14,609
already jeopardizing all the far Florida

423
00:22:09,569 --> 00:22:17,519
citrus industry and probably it is

424
00:22:14,608 --> 00:22:19,980
pretty really quickly and if you have

425
00:22:17,519 --> 00:22:22,410
these nice grow

426
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:24,779
in Florida without proper management in

427
00:22:22,410 --> 00:22:27,420
less than five years you can add end up

428
00:22:24,779 --> 00:22:29,750
like this you can grow skeletons in

429
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:33,630
right now in Florida we have more than

430
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:35,160
130,000 acres of groves abandoned so

431
00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:37,110
these are diseases caused by

432
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:41,000
candidatos libera back Thursday Atticus

433
00:22:37,109 --> 00:22:44,689
and is a spread by therefore in a c3

434
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:47,640
which can fit all cities these are

435
00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:51,660
typical symptoms of HIV you have a

436
00:22:47,640 --> 00:23:14,520
uneven distribution of yellow and to

437
00:22:51,660 --> 00:23:18,570
give you some numbers know if it is

438
00:23:14,519 --> 00:23:23,369
interfering okay so Cilla's was

439
00:23:18,569 --> 00:23:26,399
initially detect in Florida in 2005 and

440
00:23:23,369 --> 00:23:30,289
since then the production of boxes

441
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:35,400
dropped from 300 million to 68 millions

442
00:23:30,289 --> 00:23:39,839
at the same times the cost of of the

443
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:45,740
acres increased from 700 dollars to more

444
00:23:39,839 --> 00:23:51,319
than 2000 dollars in a most important

445
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:55,170
there is no cure for HIV disease and

446
00:23:51,319 --> 00:23:58,889
there are many groups that are trying to

447
00:23:55,170 --> 00:24:02,759
figure out how to fight back this is a

448
00:23:58,890 --> 00:24:06,090
bacteria and the way we are trying to to

449
00:24:02,759 --> 00:24:08,970
fight this bacteria as some nice novelty

450
00:24:06,089 --> 00:24:11,730
so we are trying with this multi to

451
00:24:08,970 --> 00:24:16,589
multi institutional collaboration to

452
00:24:11,730 --> 00:24:20,370
develop a synthetic bacteria with this

453
00:24:16,589 --> 00:24:21,480
particular feature feature so we want a

454
00:24:20,369 --> 00:24:23,759
culture bacteria

455
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:26,910
see last right now is no culturable and

456
00:24:23,759 --> 00:24:28,819
these are slow down the research on this

457
00:24:26,910 --> 00:24:32,000
photosystem

458
00:24:28,819 --> 00:24:34,428
and we wanted to create also as a

459
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:39,169
correction system to deploy bacterial

460
00:24:34,429 --> 00:24:41,269
scene so we can use this bacteria which

461
00:24:39,169 --> 00:24:43,159
is culturable which has assistant to

462
00:24:41,269 --> 00:24:46,638
secure it by piercing and so we can use

463
00:24:43,159 --> 00:24:49,580
as a cross protection against heelas but

464
00:24:46,638 --> 00:24:51,678
also this system not only can work in

465
00:24:49,579 --> 00:24:56,898
sylla's you can potentially be used for

466
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:59,809
studying other Patou system and so we

467
00:24:56,898 --> 00:25:05,199
have a different team task and for

468
00:24:59,808 --> 00:25:07,940
example SGI under by craig Venter and

469
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:13,009
2010 it was the for the first time was

470
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:15,620
able to generate a synthetic bacteria

471
00:25:13,009 --> 00:25:18,048
from scratch in laboratory so they are

472
00:25:15,619 --> 00:25:20,989
taking care of a synthetic genome

473
00:25:18,048 --> 00:25:22,819
generation and here in Crennel Michele

474
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:25,970
is working on a vector acquisition and

475
00:25:22,819 --> 00:25:28,398
transmission and at USDA in Fort Pierce

476
00:25:25,970 --> 00:25:32,120
they are working and looking for

477
00:25:28,398 --> 00:25:35,449
bacteria in there can be used against

478
00:25:32,119 --> 00:25:38,898
Sheila's and these are my tasks so I'm

479
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:41,450
trying to identify a factor gene there

480
00:25:38,898 --> 00:25:44,508
are helping the synthetic bacteria to L

481
00:25:41,450 --> 00:25:47,240
the infection also I'm looking for gene

482
00:25:44,509 --> 00:25:51,079
that can may induce pathogenic so we

483
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:53,960
want to in we want to include genes that

484
00:25:51,079 --> 00:25:58,339
allow infestation now we want to remove

485
00:25:53,960 --> 00:26:00,590
gene that can cause autogenic and I'm

486
00:25:58,339 --> 00:26:03,648
also looking for a mechanical creature

487
00:26:00,589 --> 00:26:05,869
inoculation system so they will be give

488
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:08,469
us a quick way to study the bacteria

489
00:26:05,869 --> 00:26:15,408
without using the vector right now and

490
00:26:08,470 --> 00:26:19,038
this is the name of this synthetic

491
00:26:15,409 --> 00:26:21,528
bacteria and we called libera back there

492
00:26:19,038 --> 00:26:27,169
defense forum and awfully we can use it

493
00:26:21,528 --> 00:26:30,398
to fight Sheila's so first ask effective

494
00:26:27,169 --> 00:26:36,649
identification so I'll see las

495
00:26:30,398 --> 00:26:39,168
manipulates is lost and so to do that so

496
00:26:36,648 --> 00:26:42,649
Sheila's is a from limited bacterium and

497
00:26:39,169 --> 00:26:47,330
they take advantage of his vector Siletz

498
00:26:42,650 --> 00:26:49,790
a similar to f80 it used the stylet to

499
00:26:47,329 --> 00:26:53,269
probably plant cells and eventually then

500
00:26:49,789 --> 00:26:55,639
find the SIP elements here an infected

501
00:26:53,269 --> 00:26:59,809
city will secrete also the bacteria and

502
00:26:55,640 --> 00:27:00,470
this bacteria will secrete effector

503
00:26:59,809 --> 00:27:02,869
proteins

504
00:27:00,470 --> 00:27:05,900
now this effector proteins can move the

505
00:27:02,869 --> 00:27:10,359
phloem and possibly target different

506
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:14,360
organelles and modulate plant function

507
00:27:10,359 --> 00:27:16,639
so this is the pipeline we used to

508
00:27:14,359 --> 00:27:18,589
identify sylla's effectors and it is

509
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:21,170
similar to the one we use for a

510
00:27:18,589 --> 00:27:24,379
veterinarian efforts so we start with

511
00:27:21,170 --> 00:27:28,850
the Assad steel as coding genes and wine

512
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:32,060
and then we apply different filters like

513
00:27:28,849 --> 00:27:34,069
presence of signal peptide and we've

514
00:27:32,059 --> 00:27:36,980
removed protein without with the

515
00:27:34,069 --> 00:27:40,609
transmembrane domain so we end up with

516
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:42,950
28 putatively secret effectors and then

517
00:27:40,609 --> 00:27:45,859
we clone without the signal peptide so

518
00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:48,039
we asked over suppress all in the mature

519
00:27:45,859 --> 00:27:51,589
protein in Nicosia Elementary Jana and

520
00:27:48,039 --> 00:27:54,039
we also look for localization of this

521
00:27:51,589 --> 00:27:59,109
effector implant and we look also for

522
00:27:54,039 --> 00:28:02,420
phenotypes and one of this protein last

523
00:27:59,109 --> 00:28:04,429
5315 it was really interesting as you

524
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:08,269
can see it two days later this pressure

525
00:28:04,430 --> 00:28:11,570
he had cell that and I will talk about

526
00:28:08,269 --> 00:28:14,029
this in the next few slides and but also

527
00:28:11,569 --> 00:28:17,089
these a protein was targeting a

528
00:28:14,029 --> 00:28:19,039
chloroplast we can see the protease

529
00:28:17,089 --> 00:28:23,899
signal surrounding the the chloroplast

530
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:25,730
and also this protein was inducing

531
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:28,190
Carlos the pollution in the vascular

532
00:28:25,730 --> 00:28:30,740
tissue and this is one of the symptoms

533
00:28:28,190 --> 00:28:32,690
we have in HIV disease band we have a

534
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:37,519
high colors deposition the vascular

535
00:28:32,690 --> 00:28:40,160
tissue and this is the de protein you

536
00:28:37,519 --> 00:28:42,259
can see there is a signal peptide but we

537
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:44,000
also have a chloroplast targeting

538
00:28:42,259 --> 00:28:48,859
sequence and then the rest of the

539
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:50,839
protein so the last 5315 is a protein

540
00:28:48,859 --> 00:28:53,149
without the signal peptide and then i

541
00:28:50,839 --> 00:28:54,889
generate another construct without a

542
00:28:53,150 --> 00:28:56,538
signal peptide in a chloroplast

543
00:28:54,890 --> 00:28:59,269
targeting sequence

544
00:28:56,538 --> 00:29:01,338
and while the 5315 was causing cell

545
00:28:59,269 --> 00:29:03,558
death the one without the chloroplast

546
00:29:01,338 --> 00:29:06,678
targeted sequence was causing chlorosis

547
00:29:03,558 --> 00:29:09,048
and I found that the chlorosis was a

548
00:29:06,679 --> 00:29:11,389
caused by starch accumulation so this

549
00:29:09,048 --> 00:29:13,940
protein trigger a massive starch

550
00:29:11,388 --> 00:29:15,978
accumulation in leaf and you can see

551
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:18,558
during the day we have a cumulation the

552
00:29:15,979 --> 00:29:20,359
starch and the more interestingly we see

553
00:29:18,558 --> 00:29:24,469
that during the night there is no

554
00:29:20,358 --> 00:29:27,378
degradation the starch and we also look

555
00:29:24,469 --> 00:29:29,028
from some gene expression of gene

556
00:29:27,378 --> 00:29:32,328
related to the starch synthesis and

557
00:29:29,028 --> 00:29:33,499
starts degradation and this gene related

558
00:29:32,328 --> 00:29:34,989
to the starch degradation or

559
00:29:33,499 --> 00:29:40,129
downregulated

560
00:29:34,989 --> 00:29:42,679
and it shall be symptoms are caused by

561
00:29:40,128 --> 00:29:45,678
mass massive starch accommodation until

562
00:29:42,679 --> 00:29:47,089
chlorophyll structures are disrupted

563
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:50,629
with the resulting qiraji so this

564
00:29:47,088 --> 00:29:53,479
protein seems to be very important in

565
00:29:50,628 --> 00:29:55,939
the HIV photosystem and there is also

566
00:29:53,479 --> 00:29:57,709
some follow up of this protein since we

567
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:59,599
discovered these effectors candidate

568
00:29:57,709 --> 00:30:02,318
other groups are working on these

569
00:29:59,598 --> 00:30:05,028
effectors and they found first that is a

570
00:30:02,318 --> 00:30:09,588
protein is highly secreted in plant

571
00:30:05,028 --> 00:30:11,749
infected and can be used as a detection

572
00:30:09,588 --> 00:30:14,618
marker as this protein is moving away

573
00:30:11,749 --> 00:30:17,179
from the bacteria so we can detect these

574
00:30:14,618 --> 00:30:19,338
infection even if the bacteria is not

575
00:30:17,179 --> 00:30:23,169
present in the leaf by another part of

576
00:30:19,338 --> 00:30:26,618
the plant and also they found that these

577
00:30:23,169 --> 00:30:31,099
proteins play a key role in the HIV

578
00:30:26,618 --> 00:30:33,738
pathogenicity now i was talking about

579
00:30:31,098 --> 00:30:37,788
cell death causing by disease factors

580
00:30:33,739 --> 00:30:42,318
and we found three factors causes cell

581
00:30:37,788 --> 00:30:44,898
that an effector to community relies on

582
00:30:42,318 --> 00:30:47,719
a resistant protein that recognizes

583
00:30:44,898 --> 00:30:49,488
effectors in a specific manner in you

584
00:30:47,719 --> 00:30:54,259
see program cell that to prevent the

585
00:30:49,489 --> 00:30:57,639
pathogen from spreading and one of the

586
00:30:54,259 --> 00:31:02,179
component for this response are they are

587
00:30:57,638 --> 00:31:05,148
resistant protein so the idea is that

588
00:31:02,179 --> 00:31:07,369
nikhat elementary Jana as resistant

589
00:31:05,148 --> 00:31:09,819
protein they can recognize this effector

590
00:31:07,368 --> 00:31:13,449
while Cetus doesn't have it

591
00:31:09,819 --> 00:31:15,869
so we are now in collaboration with the

592
00:31:13,450 --> 00:31:18,640
Michelle we want to try to see if we can

593
00:31:15,869 --> 00:31:19,539
identify this our gene from Nakata

594
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:22,120
Elementary Jana

595
00:31:19,539 --> 00:31:24,970
so we over spread these defectors in

596
00:31:22,119 --> 00:31:27,639
Makati elementary Jana fuse to reflect

597
00:31:24,970 --> 00:31:30,910
that and then we can bind with magnetic

598
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:33,070
beads this tag and possibly our gene

599
00:31:30,910 --> 00:31:35,259
interacting with the protein and then we

600
00:31:33,069 --> 00:31:39,460
remove washing all the other ausrotten

601
00:31:35,259 --> 00:31:42,640
and then we can synthetic an sequence

602
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:44,529
the our gene and if we have an R gene

603
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:46,660
from nickel Jana been tamiana they

604
00:31:44,529 --> 00:31:49,990
recognize this effector we can

605
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:52,029
eventually generate a transgenic citrus

606
00:31:49,990 --> 00:31:56,470
expressing an e-coat element beyond our

607
00:31:52,029 --> 00:32:02,940
gene they can allow the sea to spawn to

608
00:31:56,470 --> 00:32:06,250
recognize alas and be immune to it now

609
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:08,710
for this photo system the best

610
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:10,869
management for this disease is the

611
00:32:08,710 --> 00:32:15,130
prevention of this in the introduction

612
00:32:10,869 --> 00:32:17,349
an establishment and so it's important

613
00:32:15,130 --> 00:32:20,740
to have a system for early detection so

614
00:32:17,349 --> 00:32:24,629
you can remove the infected plant and

615
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:27,990
avoid spreading on in your groves and

616
00:32:24,630 --> 00:32:32,230
these are really fascinating a way to

617
00:32:27,990 --> 00:32:38,349
detect seedless infected citrus tree and

618
00:32:32,230 --> 00:32:41,549
in usda-ars King got well in this group

619
00:32:38,349 --> 00:32:41,549
they are using dogs to

620
00:32:42,169 --> 00:32:47,600
recognized Sheila's infected three and

621
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:50,600
it is talking detect the infection two

622
00:32:47,599 --> 00:32:53,388
weeks after inoculation usually with

623
00:32:50,599 --> 00:32:57,829
Cooper she takes two to 12 months not

624
00:32:53,388 --> 00:33:00,079
because the cou PCR is no reliable but

625
00:32:57,829 --> 00:33:02,778
because the sampling of the tree is

626
00:33:00,079 --> 00:33:04,638
difficult if you think the sillies can

627
00:33:02,778 --> 00:33:06,710
feed on the top of the tree and then you

628
00:33:04,638 --> 00:33:11,778
take leaves random list you can have a

629
00:33:06,710 --> 00:33:15,350
negative tissue so these are a really

630
00:33:11,778 --> 00:33:20,259
nice way to detect

631
00:33:15,349 --> 00:33:23,658
sylla's in the Groves now these dogs

632
00:33:20,259 --> 00:33:28,069
recognize plant early volatize triggered

633
00:33:23,659 --> 00:33:30,320
by Sheila's bacterium right now we know

634
00:33:28,069 --> 00:33:32,418
the Cilla's bacterial secretes effector

635
00:33:30,319 --> 00:33:35,678
molecules after injection after

636
00:33:32,419 --> 00:33:38,210
infection and we can detect is a gene

637
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:42,048
vector gene after six hour after

638
00:33:38,210 --> 00:33:43,190
inoculation and is a factor we know that

639
00:33:42,048 --> 00:33:47,028
they can travel through the vascular

640
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:50,419
system and modulate us activity some

641
00:33:47,028 --> 00:33:53,028
idea was are these dog detecting

642
00:33:50,419 --> 00:33:57,169
volatize triggered by effector molecules

643
00:33:53,028 --> 00:34:00,710
so and so I designed this experiment we

644
00:33:57,169 --> 00:34:03,830
have four buckets contains 16 Nicotiana

645
00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:07,700
main tamiana plants and wild type net

646
00:34:03,829 --> 00:34:09,259
control in 16 selasa spectrum these are

647
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:13,039
the effector that our earliest press

648
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:16,069
during infection and the dogs when they

649
00:34:13,039 --> 00:34:18,889
identify a Cilla's infected citrus they

650
00:34:16,068 --> 00:34:21,079
sit down they never work with the with

651
00:34:18,889 --> 00:34:23,950
the nicotine remain tamiana and i am the

652
00:34:21,079 --> 00:34:27,230
only one that knows the dis bucket

653
00:34:23,949 --> 00:34:30,858
contained se las effectors and so we run

654
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:33,829
the dogs we use the eight dogs and he's

655
00:34:30,858 --> 00:34:36,318
a dogs first bucket second bucket and

656
00:34:33,829 --> 00:34:39,250
this is a bucket with the factors and I

657
00:34:36,318 --> 00:34:43,190
was really amazed when it was

658
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:46,099
recognizing and sit there so they

659
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:47,720
recognizing this plan and they think

660
00:34:46,099 --> 00:34:49,068
this is infected so they are recognizes

661
00:34:47,719 --> 00:34:51,918
the same volatize

662
00:34:49,068 --> 00:34:53,690
we having citrus in the same voltage is

663
00:34:51,918 --> 00:34:54,529
triggered by one effector in the coat

664
00:34:53,690 --> 00:34:55,760
element am Jana

665
00:34:54,530 --> 00:34:59,930
so this another

666
00:34:55,760 --> 00:35:03,260
dogs and all dogs recognize these

667
00:34:59,929 --> 00:35:05,618
buckets and these are a bucket with 16

668
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:07,550
plants so the dog very quickly

669
00:35:05,619 --> 00:35:11,090
recognized these effectors

670
00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:13,070
so we also line up these plants so every

671
00:35:11,090 --> 00:35:16,309
plant was expressing one effectors and

672
00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:20,930
at the end they recognized for effectors

673
00:35:16,309 --> 00:35:23,358
and so so this dog are recognizing

674
00:35:20,929 --> 00:35:25,849
Sheila's infected citrus at early stage

675
00:35:23,358 --> 00:35:27,980
was ineffective marker these are

676
00:35:25,849 --> 00:35:31,309
indirect recognition they use apologized

677
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:34,969
so our idea is now to develop an

678
00:35:31,309 --> 00:35:37,219
antibody protein detection kit against

679
00:35:34,969 --> 00:35:39,529
this effector molecule there are areas

680
00:35:37,219 --> 00:35:43,789
pressed and they are detected by the

681
00:35:39,530 --> 00:35:47,450
dogs so hopefully we can get we can be

682
00:35:43,789 --> 00:35:50,900
using the groves and and they can detect

683
00:35:47,449 --> 00:35:54,980
early they sink the bacillus in in

684
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:58,309
citrus leaves now the second task was a

685
00:35:54,980 --> 00:36:01,670
mechanic inoculation and there is no

686
00:35:58,309 --> 00:36:07,039
mechanical collation for Sheila's so far

687
00:36:01,670 --> 00:36:10,550
so we develop a new way to inoculate

688
00:36:07,039 --> 00:36:14,259
Sheila's implant and again Sheila's is

689
00:36:10,550 --> 00:36:18,200
no culturable yet so he's a select

690
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:21,530
Sheila's infected got four for the

691
00:36:18,199 --> 00:36:24,559
bacteria in any we use this system is a

692
00:36:21,530 --> 00:36:26,450
3d printer device that can be attached

693
00:36:24,559 --> 00:36:29,389
to the plan and communicated with the

694
00:36:26,449 --> 00:36:32,868
vascular tissue so I stride this really

695
00:36:29,389 --> 00:36:35,179
at the gut I struck the bacteria from

696
00:36:32,869 --> 00:36:38,480
the gut and then I add the bacteria in

697
00:36:35,179 --> 00:36:42,889
this system and then I will I wait 24

698
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:46,490
hours and then I his cookies yard to the

699
00:36:42,889 --> 00:36:49,460
deck bacteria in the plant and in 24

700
00:36:46,489 --> 00:36:52,459
hours I was able to detect Cilla's in

701
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:55,670
all the tissue and two months later also

702
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:58,420
I could detect Phyllis bacteria into the

703
00:36:55,670 --> 00:37:01,490
leaf so this is a systemic infection and

704
00:36:58,420 --> 00:37:04,940
to show you how it works

705
00:37:01,489 --> 00:37:06,849
I now using a fluorescent problem so

706
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:09,619
again I'm using this fluorescent probe

707
00:37:06,849 --> 00:37:13,998
this molecule in the device

708
00:37:09,619 --> 00:37:16,309
I wait 24 hours and then I slice they

709
00:37:13,998 --> 00:37:20,659
stem in the roots and then I look under

710
00:37:16,309 --> 00:37:25,039
fluorescent microscope and you want to

711
00:37:20,659 --> 00:37:27,588
see that right okay

712
00:37:25,039 --> 00:37:29,329
these are the results so these are the

713
00:37:27,588 --> 00:37:31,880
different section you can see the

714
00:37:29,329 --> 00:37:33,470
fluorescent probe is a evenly

715
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:37,519
distributed in the vascular tissue

716
00:37:33,469 --> 00:37:42,409
bought the stem but also in the roots

717
00:37:37,518 --> 00:37:48,048
and so this system can deliver bacteria

718
00:37:42,409 --> 00:37:50,690
but can also deliver molecules so why we

719
00:37:48,048 --> 00:37:53,268
stopped there so we can use to screen

720
00:37:50,690 --> 00:37:56,690
molecule against pathogens we can also

721
00:37:53,268 --> 00:37:58,729
screen molecule against inset now we can

722
00:37:56,690 --> 00:38:03,980
also use this device to deliver doubles

723
00:37:58,730 --> 00:38:06,019
RNA to regulate us genes or we can

724
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:08,719
deliver doubles Renee for plant feeding

725
00:38:06,018 --> 00:38:12,169
and then this this system will deliver

726
00:38:08,719 --> 00:38:18,998
the molecule where they insert is

727
00:38:12,170 --> 00:38:18,999
feeding so there was the second task and

728
00:38:19,449 --> 00:38:29,989
this is a my last project and in this

729
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:33,588
project study interaction between fungus

730
00:38:29,989 --> 00:38:36,139
and insect and to do that I'm using an

731
00:38:33,588 --> 00:38:40,028
end to pathogenic fungi and we are going

732
00:38:36,139 --> 00:38:43,969
to use this system to to measure citrus

733
00:38:40,028 --> 00:38:46,389
to manage seed therefore in a cities

734
00:38:43,969 --> 00:38:51,379
they seal it they transmit the bacteria

735
00:38:46,389 --> 00:38:54,048
because right now the main control for

736
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:55,970
HIV is to control the vector so we want

737
00:38:54,048 --> 00:38:57,920
to reduce the number of the vector and

738
00:38:55,969 --> 00:39:02,058
to do that they use a chemical

739
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:05,539
insecticides but this is no sustainable

740
00:39:02,059 --> 00:39:08,298
strategy first we have an environmental

741
00:39:05,539 --> 00:39:10,430
pollution we read that there is a

742
00:39:08,298 --> 00:39:13,460
reduction or three traffic interaction

743
00:39:10,429 --> 00:39:16,998
and inks that can chemical is a

744
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:19,759
resistant to insects and we may have

745
00:39:16,998 --> 00:39:22,219
some pesticide residue in a food and

746
00:39:19,759 --> 00:39:23,420
obviously we need constant application

747
00:39:22,219 --> 00:39:26,500
to maintain the

748
00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:29,960
evenness so we are trying now these a

749
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:32,239
fungus is Aria femoral Xia and these are

750
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:36,108
the results after six days post

751
00:39:32,239 --> 00:39:39,500
inoculation and the way we do is a

752
00:39:36,108 --> 00:39:42,170
spraying the sport to the psyllids and

753
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:45,048
then we look the percent of mortality

754
00:39:42,170 --> 00:39:47,809
over six days and you can see after six

755
00:39:45,048 --> 00:39:50,838
day we have already almost 100% of

756
00:39:47,809 --> 00:39:53,660
mortality but already after three days

757
00:39:50,838 --> 00:39:57,650
you can see these symptoms on a psyllids

758
00:39:53,659 --> 00:40:00,980
and in four days we have a the fungus

759
00:39:57,650 --> 00:40:04,068
breaking through the skeleton and a six

760
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:06,440
day later the fungus is is ready to

761
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:11,420
spread again in fact recently or

762
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:14,480
vertically so these are intimate

763
00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:16,099
photogenic fungal are well known but the

764
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:18,440
mechanism underlying the molecular

765
00:40:16,099 --> 00:40:20,630
pathogenesis of enter multiple genic

766
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:23,150
fungi are rather limited

767
00:40:20,630 --> 00:40:25,490
understood especially the effector

768
00:40:23,150 --> 00:40:27,349
machinery has not been established in

769
00:40:25,489 --> 00:40:31,278
the interaction between famosa and exit

770
00:40:27,349 --> 00:40:34,490
so here again we are trying to identify

771
00:40:31,278 --> 00:40:37,489
potential effector candidates and we

772
00:40:34,489 --> 00:40:43,129
start with the coding protein counts and

773
00:40:37,489 --> 00:40:45,199
we apply our filters and then we end up

774
00:40:43,130 --> 00:40:48,798
with hundred seventy candidate effectors

775
00:40:45,199 --> 00:40:51,259
and we are also combining this effector

776
00:40:48,798 --> 00:40:55,750
with RNA sequences analysis and gene

777
00:40:51,259 --> 00:40:58,818
expression and we found that many genes

778
00:40:55,750 --> 00:41:02,710
many candidate effector higher early

779
00:40:58,818 --> 00:41:07,969
area highly expressed during the first

780
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:11,480
hours also after 24 hours and after 72

781
00:41:07,969 --> 00:41:15,318
hours and then a they goes down and this

782
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:18,588
is a very beginning of this project but

783
00:41:15,318 --> 00:41:22,278
we also want to later to do some protein

784
00:41:18,588 --> 00:41:25,068
in functional analysis and we can try to

785
00:41:22,278 --> 00:41:28,190
express this protein plans or use

786
00:41:25,068 --> 00:41:31,308
artificial diet and check inside the

787
00:41:28,190 --> 00:41:34,130
quality and performance see what what

788
00:41:31,309 --> 00:41:36,150
molecule are can interfere with a

789
00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:40,588
withering set

790
00:41:36,150 --> 00:41:41,450
and this was a my last slide so final

791
00:41:40,588 --> 00:41:44,489
remarks

792
00:41:41,449 --> 00:41:46,230
so most pathogens are defeated following

793
00:41:44,489 --> 00:41:49,739
detection of conserved pathogen

794
00:41:46,230 --> 00:41:52,048
molecules and pathogens deliver

795
00:41:49,739 --> 00:41:55,979
molecules called effector inside their

796
00:41:52,048 --> 00:41:58,469
austrian Abel infestation and effector

797
00:41:55,980 --> 00:42:01,889
molecules our key component for all part

798
00:41:58,469 --> 00:42:04,828
of systems and effector molecules can be

799
00:42:01,889 --> 00:42:08,848
used as a guide to improve resistance in

800
00:42:04,829 --> 00:42:12,140
plants and so would I to thank these

801
00:42:08,849 --> 00:42:18,000
people that really helped me to build my

802
00:42:12,139 --> 00:42:23,599
strength my career and help me to to

803
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:31,898
build my research program so thank you

804
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:31,898
[Applause]

805
00:42:36,199 --> 00:42:44,159
the microphone isn't working out I'm

806
00:42:42,239 --> 00:42:47,088
just curious in terms of the work and

807
00:42:44,159 --> 00:42:49,769
research you've been doing if the

808
00:42:47,088 --> 00:42:52,528
results of this is going to be of this

809
00:42:49,769 --> 00:42:56,429
work is going to be more applicable in

810
00:42:52,528 --> 00:42:58,829
terms of detecting the pathogen in the

811
00:42:56,429 --> 00:43:02,098
in the citrus tree or is it going to be

812
00:42:58,829 --> 00:43:10,619
more used in terms of actual control

813
00:43:02,099 --> 00:43:14,400
procedures the problem yes well both we

814
00:43:10,619 --> 00:43:16,349
want to use factors first we want to

815
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:17,760
identify the effective function what

816
00:43:16,349 --> 00:43:20,369
they do we don't know yet the function

817
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:22,650
of these effectors oh they target so

818
00:43:20,369 --> 00:43:25,559
when we know the target we may know the

819
00:43:22,650 --> 00:43:28,019
function we know what the importance of

820
00:43:25,559 --> 00:43:30,630
this molecule in the interaction it is

821
00:43:28,019 --> 00:43:34,230
photosystem and then we can use these as

822
00:43:30,630 --> 00:43:37,829
a tool to improve the sitter's resistant

823
00:43:34,230 --> 00:43:41,789
we can but now we can for example we can

824
00:43:37,829 --> 00:43:43,720
use if we can for resistant genes to

825
00:43:41,789 --> 00:43:46,210
improve it

826
00:43:43,719 --> 00:43:49,559
or the other way is to find the target

827
00:43:46,210 --> 00:43:53,470
of these effectors maybe are susceptible

828
00:43:49,559 --> 00:43:58,420
molecule so when we did really identify

829
00:43:53,469 --> 00:44:02,980
the function we may find a way to do to

830
00:43:58,420 --> 00:44:05,470
improve the resistance anyone else all

831
00:44:02,980 --> 00:44:07,809
right so I have a dog question so the

832
00:44:05,469 --> 00:44:10,000
dogs are detecting the volatile made by

833
00:44:07,809 --> 00:44:11,619
the plant right and you're gonna be

834
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,989
working on making antibodies to the

835
00:44:11,619 --> 00:44:15,670
effector right are you also working on

836
00:44:13,989 --> 00:44:17,259
collecting headspace and seeing

837
00:44:15,670 --> 00:44:20,559
identifying what these fossils could be

838
00:44:17,260 --> 00:44:23,980
no these are scientific we will do it we

839
00:44:20,559 --> 00:44:26,289
are this is a really recent so the idea

840
00:44:23,980 --> 00:44:29,079
is actually to see what volatize are

841
00:44:26,289 --> 00:44:33,369
expressed triggering and nicotine

842
00:44:29,079 --> 00:44:35,769
tamiana with effector an effector and

843
00:44:33,369 --> 00:44:37,838
also in situ is affected when affected

844
00:44:35,769 --> 00:44:41,730
and see if there is an overlapping so we

845
00:44:37,838 --> 00:44:41,730
will also look for a volatiles

846
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:50,349
hi I was really intrigued by the 3d

847
00:44:47,230 --> 00:44:55,300
printed device that you attach and I was

848
00:44:50,349 --> 00:44:58,450
curious if you know if the seal s is

849
00:44:55,300 --> 00:45:01,869
actually alive so we think is alive

850
00:44:58,449 --> 00:45:07,689
because two months later I can detect

851
00:45:01,869 --> 00:45:10,390
gene expression so we are looking at DNA

852
00:45:07,690 --> 00:45:13,530
and RNA and we look at the expression of

853
00:45:10,389 --> 00:45:15,879
the effectors 28 effectors and they are

854
00:45:13,530 --> 00:45:21,519
upregulated so it looks like the

855
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:24,190
bacteria is alive my question actually

856
00:45:21,519 --> 00:45:26,338
follows straight on from that it's a

857
00:45:24,190 --> 00:45:29,980
question about your seal as effectors

858
00:45:26,338 --> 00:45:32,230
expressed in the plant is the population

859
00:45:29,980 --> 00:45:34,599
size if you then infect the plant with

860
00:45:32,230 --> 00:45:37,690
sealers it's the population size of the

861
00:45:34,599 --> 00:45:39,880
sealers increased or decreased and does

862
00:45:37,690 --> 00:45:43,088
it affect the transmissibility back to

863
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:44,588
the insect so it's asking about the

864
00:45:43,088 --> 00:45:46,690
effect of proteins not from this

865
00:45:44,588 --> 00:45:50,049
perspective of the immediate function

866
00:45:46,690 --> 00:45:52,539
but in terms of the effect on the seal

867
00:45:50,050 --> 00:45:57,210
ass and whether the seal as benefits

868
00:45:52,539 --> 00:45:57,210
from the secretion of those proteins

869
00:46:00,230 --> 00:46:06,440
so you have plants that are expressing

870
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:09,980
see less affect approach wise if have

871
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:12,380
you done the experiments to then infect

872
00:46:09,980 --> 00:46:14,990
those PLAs would seal us and see if they

873
00:46:12,380 --> 00:46:17,740
have a selection or we do not but we

874
00:46:14,989 --> 00:46:20,239
were using nicotine remain tamiana and

875
00:46:17,739 --> 00:46:22,879
it's difficult to infect incremental

876
00:46:20,239 --> 00:46:24,829
Jana but right now we are expressed we

877
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:28,099
are generating transgenic citrus

878
00:46:24,829 --> 00:46:30,889
expressing this factor so that case we

879
00:46:28,099 --> 00:46:32,960
can try to inoculate seal us in this

880
00:46:30,889 --> 00:46:35,239
transgenic plant see if increase or

881
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:41,539
decrease there the growth of the

882
00:46:35,239 --> 00:46:44,149
bacteria so my question my question

883
00:46:41,539 --> 00:46:47,119
follows on from the dog question if you

884
00:46:44,150 --> 00:46:49,220
are if you make either a diagnostic or

885
00:46:47,119 --> 00:46:52,429
some kind of treatment that's targeted

886
00:46:49,219 --> 00:46:54,019
essentially at one of the effectors why

887
00:46:52,429 --> 00:46:55,730
don't don't you expect to see less -

888
00:46:54,019 --> 00:46:57,530
just drop that effector is there any

889
00:46:55,730 --> 00:47:02,389
reason to think that it's essential for

890
00:46:57,530 --> 00:47:11,480
infection we we think why we think is

891
00:47:02,389 --> 00:47:22,339
important sorry other words why should

892
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:25,909
the dumb the effector if the effector is

893
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:27,950
what you're using - so recognize plants

894
00:47:25,909 --> 00:47:29,659
that then need to be called say that's a

895
00:47:27,949 --> 00:47:31,969
strong selective pressure against the

896
00:47:29,659 --> 00:47:33,980
pathogen and there would be a strong

897
00:47:31,969 --> 00:47:35,329
selective advantage for a pathogen that

898
00:47:33,980 --> 00:47:37,130
dropped out effectors that you could no

899
00:47:35,329 --> 00:47:39,619
longer detect and right but we are using

900
00:47:37,130 --> 00:47:42,230
a cocktail of antibodies so it needs to

901
00:47:39,619 --> 00:47:43,339
drop many effectors so in the case I

902
00:47:42,230 --> 00:47:45,949
don't know if you can maybe did not

903
00:47:43,340 --> 00:47:48,350
survive anymore if you keep the job all

904
00:47:45,949 --> 00:47:49,609
the all the factors that's essentially

905
00:47:48,349 --> 00:47:51,349
the question is how much do you know

906
00:47:49,610 --> 00:47:55,180
about the essentialness for infection of

907
00:47:51,349 --> 00:47:57,199
these effectors we don't know yet the

908
00:47:55,179 --> 00:47:58,969
function we don't know the function we

909
00:47:57,199 --> 00:48:01,069
know that the sum of the is factor our

910
00:47:58,969 --> 00:48:04,279
earliest press six hour later we can

911
00:48:01,070 --> 00:48:06,490
detect these effectors 24 hours later we

912
00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:09,080
have a different waves of effectors a

913
00:48:06,489 --> 00:48:09,889
week later we have a different waves of

914
00:48:09,079 --> 00:48:12,498
effectors

915
00:48:09,889 --> 00:48:14,868
but we still don't know the function day

916
00:48:12,498 --> 00:48:17,629
we can put aside it the early effector

917
00:48:14,869 --> 00:48:19,789
are important for modify modulated

918
00:48:17,630 --> 00:48:22,009
finally phase responses then later

919
00:48:19,789 --> 00:48:29,559
effector a probably important for

920
00:48:22,009 --> 00:48:35,509
spreading the bacteria so the psyllid

921
00:48:29,559 --> 00:48:38,569
the Silla is delivering see last little

922
00:48:35,509 --> 00:48:41,900
flower right right is it possible that

923
00:48:38,568 --> 00:48:43,670
your device is introducing see mass in

924
00:48:41,900 --> 00:48:46,729
the desire limb as we're honest and it's

925
00:48:43,670 --> 00:48:49,999
possible yeah we think is actually

926
00:48:46,728 --> 00:48:53,268
possible because we see on the top of

927
00:48:49,998 --> 00:48:55,939
the plant on the bottom of the roots so

928
00:48:53,268 --> 00:48:59,149
the only way to go up is actually the

929
00:48:55,940 --> 00:49:02,028
asylum in taking up taking the the

930
00:48:59,150 --> 00:49:04,880
bacteria and moving up and possibly the

931
00:49:02,028 --> 00:49:07,159
bacteria can move from the asylum to the

932
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:10,459
phloem because the day later we can see

933
00:49:07,159 --> 00:49:12,708
the bacteria in the leaves there I study

934
00:49:10,458 --> 00:49:17,028
the show that this bacteria sometimes

935
00:49:12,708 --> 00:49:20,389
you can find index island and they

936
00:49:17,028 --> 00:49:22,639
remove the floor him and the bacteria

937
00:49:20,389 --> 00:49:25,098
can still move from one part of the plan

938
00:49:22,639 --> 00:49:26,690
to another plant at the time so it's

939
00:49:25,099 --> 00:49:30,199
possible but it is getting in it was

940
00:49:26,690 --> 00:49:33,619
flown with your device that may be so I

941
00:49:30,199 --> 00:49:35,749
am also but but your day I think a start

942
00:49:33,619 --> 00:49:38,088
with exciting and then it moves back to

943
00:49:35,748 --> 00:49:39,858
the phloem but we don't know yet because

944
00:49:38,088 --> 00:49:42,288
we don't have a picture

945
00:49:39,858 --> 00:49:44,808
you need to make picture of in section

946
00:49:42,289 --> 00:49:49,999
and see where actually is present the

947
00:49:44,809 --> 00:49:52,219
bacteria is there any evidence that some

948
00:49:49,998 --> 00:49:54,348
of these effectors these plant effectors

949
00:49:52,219 --> 00:49:56,749
are also expressed in the insect and

950
00:49:54,349 --> 00:49:59,028
then injected through the saliva not

951
00:49:56,748 --> 00:50:02,478
really made by the bacteria inside the

952
00:49:59,028 --> 00:50:04,548
plant so that first way that you get six

953
00:50:02,478 --> 00:50:09,169
hours I assume that you're delivering by

954
00:50:04,548 --> 00:50:12,018
insects no these are grafting

955
00:50:09,170 --> 00:50:15,619
inoculation we use a graft inoculation

956
00:50:12,018 --> 00:50:18,919
or acp inoculation I mean that because

957
00:50:15,619 --> 00:50:20,900
there is evident reversal is seamless

958
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:24,139
actually replicating when inside the

959
00:50:20,900 --> 00:50:27,110
insect right and idea is also that

960
00:50:24,139 --> 00:50:29,299
the ink said while sponsor in the cell

961
00:50:27,110 --> 00:50:32,059
is actually injecting and potentially

962
00:50:29,300 --> 00:50:33,320
effective from the bacteria so there is

963
00:50:32,059 --> 00:50:38,900
already yeah

964
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:45,940
but the effectors are produced by

965
00:50:38,900 --> 00:50:50,150
bacteria yeah there any other questions

966
00:50:45,940 --> 00:50:52,700
are there any questions in Geneva okay

967
00:50:50,150 --> 00:50:59,690
so please join me in thanking Marco once

968
00:50:52,699 --> 00:51:03,379
again this has been a production of

969
00:50:59,690 --> 00:51:06,309
