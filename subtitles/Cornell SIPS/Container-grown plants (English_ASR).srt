1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:04,960
this is a production of cornell

2
00:00:02,319 --> 00:00:04,960
university

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,160
today we're at bristol's nursery and

4
00:00:09,039 --> 00:00:12,079
we're going to be talking about

5
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:15,440
production method particularly

6
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:18,480
container production for our landscape

7
00:00:15,439 --> 00:00:20,239
jobs so typically there are three

8
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,240
different types of production method in

9
00:00:20,239 --> 00:00:25,439
other words how you grow the tree

10
00:00:22,239 --> 00:00:26,320
one is bald and burlap which is b and b

11
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:28,800
which is a

12
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,760
wire basket lined with burlap the tree

13
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,960
grows in that

14
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:34,239
that's very heavy the other one is

15
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,840
container growing

16
00:00:34,238 --> 00:00:37,199
which we'll be talking about mostly here

17
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,320
and there's another one which we'll see

18
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,640
in another video

19
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:42,159
called bare root planting but today

20
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,960
we're going to concentrate on container

21
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:45,599
growing

22
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,280
and what that means and how you use it

23
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,559
so one of the big advantages of

24
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,079
container growing is

25
00:00:48,558 --> 00:00:51,599
you're growing a plant in lightweight

26
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:53,280
media that i can pick up

27
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,760
very easily if i would try to do this

28
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:58,000
with a soil medium it would be

29
00:00:55,759 --> 00:00:59,119
probably four times heavier so

30
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,520
lightweight

31
00:00:59,119 --> 00:01:02,558
easy to grow you get a very uniform

32
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:06,000
product here

33
00:01:02,558 --> 00:01:08,478
in a container nursery and

34
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,159
it's easy you can actually grow it plant

35
00:01:08,478 --> 00:01:12,159
it at any time of the year because you

36
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:15,439
take the root system with

37
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:17,040
the plant in the plastic pot and that's

38
00:01:15,438 --> 00:01:20,000
a big advantage for the grower

39
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,360
and for the contractor who's putting in

40
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,118
the job for you

41
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:24,959
so let's walk over here and see the

42
00:01:23,118 --> 00:01:28,000
different container sizes

43
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:28,478
so typically we specify containers in

44
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,118
different

45
00:01:28,478 --> 00:01:33,359
sizes this is the smallest one we use

46
00:01:31,118 --> 00:01:37,840
what's called a number one

47
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:40,640
this is number two number three

48
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:43,040
and number five these are the different

49
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:46,799
containers are typically grown for small

50
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:48,640
shrubs understory ground cover type work

51
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:50,960
when you get into small trees you can

52
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:54,239
actually get into larger sizes

53
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:58,319
here's a number 10 and then

54
00:01:54,239 --> 00:02:00,000
a number 15 and a number 20

55
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:01,919
here and you can see these are all

56
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,159
cornice plants that are grown

57
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,200
in different container sizes and as

58
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:07,280
these grow

59
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,800
they would be up potted into a larger

60
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,800
size container

61
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,400
so they continue to grow and not become

62
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,800
restricted

63
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,599
so one of the disadvantages of container

64
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,000
growing

65
00:02:15,598 --> 00:02:19,199
is that if you let the tree grow in the

66
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,199
pot for too long

67
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:22,639
the roots can become circled and

68
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:24,560
restricted

69
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:26,399
the other thing about disadvantages of

70
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,360
container growing is because we are on a

71
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,159
lightweight

72
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,680
soilless media sometimes water movement

73
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:32,479
between the soilless media and the

74
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,040
ground

75
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:36,799
can become restricted especially when

76
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:38,079
you're doing this in summer

77
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,000
so there are advantages and

78
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,760
disadvantages but

79
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,840
most of our plant material is grown in

80
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:45,439
containers especially shrubs

81
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:48,800
and ground covers that's where we'll see

82
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:50,560
most of that those plants come from

83
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,560
oh we're just walking around the nursery

84
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:55,280
and we found these liner pots

85
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:57,439
these are not typically what we plant

86
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:00,080
but it could be for a particular job

87
00:02:57,439 --> 00:03:01,039
these are very small three-inch square

88
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:04,800
pots

89
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:06,719
with a seedling or a grafted plant

90
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,640
in the very young stages before it gets

91
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:10,639
potted up to a larger size

92
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:12,000
in some cases we might want to use small

93
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:15,919
material in a job

94
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,639
but that's not typically what we do

95
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:19,439
nina just introduced us to the container

96
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:21,039
plant

97
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:23,598
and talked a little bit about advantages

98
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:26,560
and disadvantages and also introduced

99
00:03:23,598 --> 00:03:29,039
the container size so how do we use the

100
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:33,519
container size how does that relate to

101
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:35,919
specifying and design work well uh

102
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:37,840
really there's a relationship between

103
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:40,079
the size of the container

104
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,280
and the size of the plant might go

105
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,680
without saying

106
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,719
but uh that relationship is actually

107
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,840
standardized

108
00:03:44,719 --> 00:03:49,280
in a common document called ansi z60.1

109
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,360
the american nursery standard and we'll

110
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:54,878
share that document with you

111
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:58,959
what it does is it explains uh as a

112
00:03:54,878 --> 00:04:01,679
at regular intervals what size root mass

113
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:02,560
for a shrub plant like this uh relates

114
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,239
to what size

115
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,680
plant above ground here's a plant that's

116
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:08,878
just been up potted actually

117
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:10,799
into the appropriate container size

118
00:04:08,878 --> 00:04:12,000
so we actually have two varieties of

119
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:14,959
plants here

120
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,160
and two different size so when we're

121
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:18,160
specifying

122
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,359
what we would like to have installed in

123
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,799
a project

124
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:23,279
we're always going to talk about the

125
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:24,638
size of the plant not the container

126
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:26,559
but it's important to understand that

127
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:27,120
there's a relationship there and you're

128
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,759
going to see

129
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,759
see how that plays out here uh when

130
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:35,199
we're specifying we also

131
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:38,000
uh always use a range interval

132
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:40,240
to talk about the size we want because

133
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,879
one plant in one container

134
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:44,240
class that would have one cost actually

135
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:46,639
will be at a

136
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,519
inter different range of sizes at any

137
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:52,160
given time

138
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:52,159
so here we have three units

139
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:56,160
that range from 18 to 24 inches and a

140
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,800
number five

141
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,840
short container so for this case we

142
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:04,000
would specify you know

143
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:06,159
plant acts uh 18 to 24 inches

144
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,279
and this is what would show up on site

145
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:10,000
well so

146
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:10,559
how does that relate to spacing in the

147
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,120
design

148
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,079
knowing that you have this 18 to 24 inch

149
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,600
high plant

150
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:18,000
so i'm going to show you an example of

151
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,280
like how these nine plants would lay out

152
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
and what kind of spacing they would take

153
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:22,638
up

154
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,038
for this number five container uh with

155
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:25,840
these

156
00:05:23,038 --> 00:05:27,680
18-inch plants it'd be typical to space

157
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:30,560
them about

158
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:32,079
two times the size of the plant so here

159
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,079
we have

160
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:36,079
roughly three foot spacing on center

161
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:38,319
staggered we like to stagger

162
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:39,199
and not lay out the plants in a straight

163
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:41,120
line like that

164
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:43,280
and we'll get more into that at another

165
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:45,280
time

166
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:46,478
so here we have the three foot spacing

167
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:49,439
and then up here

168
00:05:46,478 --> 00:05:50,399
uh in this number two class container

169
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:53,279
with these plants

170
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:55,198
between 12 to maybe 15 inches we're

171
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:58,799
going to space them about

172
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:59,680
24 to 30 inches apart so here we have

173
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:07,840
that

174
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:07,840
give me one second to space them out

175
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:14,719
all right so what i'm going for here is

176
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,120
a spacing that will allow these plants

177
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,960
uh

178
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,560
in a relatively short amount of time

179
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:20,159
actually to grow

180
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,600
together and colonize what we call a

181
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,240
closed canopy

182
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,919
and it's important then that we make

183
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,560
sure when we're specifying the plant

184
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:28,719
size

185
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,639
that we're thinking about plant spacing

186
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:32,319
and that relationship over time of how

187
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:34,000
they're going to grow to colonize and

188
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:36,960
occupy a space

189
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,038
uh the result of them coming together

190
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:40,719
and going into one monolithic mass

191
00:06:39,038 --> 00:06:43,680
is that with a closed canopy they'll

192
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:46,240
actually be more self-sustaining

193
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:48,079
they'll shade the root system which

194
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:50,400
helps with water retention

195
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:51,598
and they'll out compete by shading the

196
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:53,439
area of growth

197
00:06:51,598 --> 00:06:55,519
uh in the open landscape they'll

198
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:57,360
actually reduce weed recruitment so

199
00:06:55,519 --> 00:07:01,120
they'll prevent weedy species from

200
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:03,840
invading if we space them too far apart

201
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:05,680
and they're not able to fill in that

202
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:06,719
space in again a relatively short period

203
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:09,680
of time say

204
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:11,440
one or two years of establishment with

205
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,199
this open space available we're going to

206
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:15,038
see other plants coming in

207
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:16,639
in most typical installations that's

208
00:07:15,038 --> 00:07:19,759
really not what we're looking for

209
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:19,759
is that random effect

210
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:23,439
so that's more like a typical spacing

211
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:26,560
these nine plants

212
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:30,160
we're looking at something like uh

213
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:34,160
let's take a quick measure

214
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:36,880
about eight feet by about six feet

215
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:39,199
area so that's that's about how they

216
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:41,598
would lay out

217
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:42,560
so now we've spoken a little bit about

218
00:07:41,598 --> 00:07:45,199
uh you know

219
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,639
the container plant and production

220
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:49,360
techniques and methods

221
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:50,160
of potting and then we talked a little

222
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:53,680
bit about

223
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:56,800
design standards uh spacing

224
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:58,319
specifying size and layout and

225
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,079
now finally we're going to talk about

226
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:02,160
the kind of the last stage

227
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:03,758
of the journey of the plant from the

228
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,759
production facility

229
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:07,199
uh maybe through a distributor's yard

230
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:08,479
but ultimately to

231
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:10,720
a construction site where it's going to

232
00:08:08,478 --> 00:08:12,318
be installed so

233
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:14,000
now your plant has been loaded on a

234
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:16,720
truck at the production facility

235
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,680
or contractor's yard and is coming to

236
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,360
site

237
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,720
at that point you're going to want to be

238
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,840
there to inspect it

239
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,840
do you want to talk a little bit about

240
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:25,918
that yeah so sure when we

241
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:27,598
wrote the specification for this plant

242
00:08:25,918 --> 00:08:30,240
we required it to be

243
00:08:27,598 --> 00:08:31,839
of this certain size range and in this

244
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:34,158
certain pot size

245
00:08:31,839 --> 00:08:35,598
and on the truck it's better to inspect

246
00:08:34,158 --> 00:08:37,200
this on the truck

247
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:38,959
because no one wants to reload if

248
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,158
anything is rejected to reload it on the

249
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:42,000
truck and take it away

250
00:08:40,158 --> 00:08:44,000
so on the truck we'd actually inspect

251
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,399
the plant for the size

252
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,200
and pot size that we required also the

253
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:50,080
health

254
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,640
and contain condition of the plant so

255
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,360
it's not

256
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:54,559
diseased or dead parts or anything that

257
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,560
would be rejected

258
00:08:54,559 --> 00:08:58,239
so once we said that it's yes it's our

259
00:08:56,559 --> 00:09:01,199
size it's our pot

260
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:02,080
it looks good then we want to uh store

261
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,720
the plant

262
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,839
in an area on the job site so that it's

263
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:08,800
going to be protected

264
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:10,399
before planting occurs this is a very

265
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:12,079
difficult often a very difficult time

266
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:15,039
for the plant because

267
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,759
it had to be in a shady spot mulched and

268
00:09:15,039 --> 00:09:18,000
watered

269
00:09:15,759 --> 00:09:20,799
critically it's important to water them

270
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,879
realizing that in the nursery these pots

271
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:24,958
were watered every day because of the

272
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:27,679
lightweight medium

273
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:28,239
that's right so at the end of that stage

274
00:09:27,679 --> 00:09:31,120
where

275
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:33,039
the plant is on site and being stored

276
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:35,039
and it's finally time to plant

277
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:36,799
you're going to want to be there for

278
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:37,679
that to achieve the layout that you

279
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:40,559
specified

280
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:42,000
uh the correct spacing again but also

281
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:43,439
now's the final opportunity to do one

282
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,720
last look at the plant after that

283
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,000
storage period

284
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,440
and at this time the plants are all

285
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,320
going to be unpotted and you're going to

286
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,880
get to see

287
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:52,320
the root system this uh hydrangea here

288
00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:53,838
actually has a really lovely nice

289
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:57,360
fibrous root network

290
00:09:53,839 --> 00:10:00,240
not too dense lots of clean white growth

291
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:01,278
you can actually nice fresh soil smell

292
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:04,480
to it

293
00:10:01,278 --> 00:10:06,559
no dead material but also it's not

294
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:08,159
overly rooted it's not what we call pot

295
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:10,399
bound

296
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:12,559
there can be a condition where if the

297
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:14,399
plant has been in the pot too long

298
00:10:12,559 --> 00:10:16,479
actually the roots will start to grow

299
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:18,320
and encircle around the perimeter of the

300
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:20,720
pot which forms a barrier

301
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:22,079
so actually this is a really nice

302
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:24,480
looking root system

303
00:10:22,078 --> 00:10:25,599
if it were pot bound or if there weren't

304
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,959
circling roots

305
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,959
this would be another opportunity for

306
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:31,039
you to reject the plant

307
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:32,319
but no this is a good plant and it's

308
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:34,879
time for it to go in the ground

309
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:37,440
at that point once it's in the ground

310
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:37,439
you own it

311
00:10:40,799 --> 00:10:44,240
this has been a production of cornell

312
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:50,799
university
