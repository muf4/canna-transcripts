1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:05,750
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,238 --> 00:00:07,128
University so yeah so I am Terry Bates I

3
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:08,900
am the director of the Cornell Lake Erie

4
00:00:07,128 --> 00:00:11,329
research and extension lab in western

5
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:13,280
New York so we are about as far in the

6
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:16,070
western empire of Cornell as you can get

7
00:00:13,279 --> 00:00:18,169
still be in New York and I do have a map

8
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:19,399
that I'll show you where we're from so

9
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:22,310
today I'm going to talk about what we

10
00:00:19,399 --> 00:00:23,839
call the efficient vineyard project that

11
00:00:22,309 --> 00:00:25,640
building there that is the Cornell like

12
00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:27,859
Harry reaches research an extension lab

13
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:29,300
Cornell has actually been in western New

14
00:00:27,859 --> 00:00:31,519
York working with the AG industries

15
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:33,980
especially the fruit production and

16
00:00:31,518 --> 00:00:35,420
especially great production in western

17
00:00:33,979 --> 00:00:38,029
New York for about a hundred and ten

18
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:41,020
years now there's been several different

19
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:44,390
labs in that western New York area the

20
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:46,370
most recent one was in Fredonia New York

21
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:49,009
we were there from about the mid 50's

22
00:00:46,369 --> 00:00:51,049
until 2009 when we built the new

23
00:00:49,009 --> 00:00:53,869
building somebody asked how did you get

24
00:00:51,049 --> 00:00:56,539
the money do that and that was from both

25
00:00:53,869 --> 00:00:59,509
the industry and primarily from senator

26
00:00:56,539 --> 00:01:01,579
young so she was in our district and

27
00:00:59,509 --> 00:01:04,789
head of the Senate AG committee and it

28
00:01:01,579 --> 00:01:08,420
was a longtime desire for the industry

29
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:10,370
to have new lab facility dedicated for

30
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:12,980
research and Penn State as well there's

31
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:14,990
a Lake Erie regional great program the

32
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:18,469
Extension Program is a to state to

33
00:01:14,989 --> 00:01:20,479
University cooperative effort which is

34
00:01:18,469 --> 00:01:23,179
one of the only ones that's out there

35
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:24,590
and some of the people that are in this

36
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:26,570
photo so I like to acknowledge the

37
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:29,090
people that I work with at Clairol so I

38
00:01:26,569 --> 00:01:30,859
will say Clairol Cornell Lake Erie

39
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:34,280
research and accession lab it's clear

40
00:01:30,859 --> 00:01:35,780
off not the hair care product and so

41
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:37,579
there's a mix of people here so some of

42
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:39,379
them work for the Lake Erie regional

43
00:01:37,579 --> 00:01:42,289
great program extension team headed by

44
00:01:39,379 --> 00:01:44,719
Tim waggle who's IPM great New York

45
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:47,090
State grape IPM specialist

46
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:48,799
there's also Cornell Agrotech employees

47
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:50,600
there that help us run the farm and then

48
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:52,908
there are other scientists that are

49
00:01:50,599 --> 00:01:56,030
actually employed through the USDA

50
00:01:52,909 --> 00:01:58,760
funded scri project which we now call

51
00:01:56,030 --> 00:02:01,700
the efficient than your project

52
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:03,380
okay so what is the efficient vineyard

53
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:04,519
project all about I'm gonna read this

54
00:02:03,379 --> 00:02:06,379
sentence and I'm going to show you a

55
00:02:04,519 --> 00:02:07,729
couple of slides and read the sentence

56
00:02:06,379 --> 00:02:10,099
again and hopefully it'll make more

57
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:12,800
sense to you so so generally today I'll

58
00:02:10,099 --> 00:02:14,750
be talking about precision AG precision

59
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:17,420
AG technologies that we use in the grape

60
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:18,770
industry so in a broad sense talking

61
00:02:17,419 --> 00:02:20,899
about precision AG but in a very

62
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:22,340
specific sense trying to answer some of

63
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:24,740
the questions for our juice grape

64
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:27,650
industry in western New York so the goal

65
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:29,210
the projects to develop multiple sensing

66
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:31,400
and automation solutions for measuring

67
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:33,909
vineyard soil canopy and crop and I'll

68
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:36,189
talk about that and reconstitute

69
00:02:33,909 --> 00:02:39,229
reconstitute those for high resolution

70
00:02:36,189 --> 00:02:41,900
spatial crop load management now I'll

71
00:02:39,229 --> 00:02:43,459
try to explain very specifically what

72
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:47,330
we're trying to get at in terms of crop

73
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:47,810
load and how that impacts our grape

74
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:50,380
industry

75
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:52,759
okay so again I'm from western New York

76
00:02:50,379 --> 00:02:55,789
here's Buffalo here's Erie Pennsylvania

77
00:02:52,759 --> 00:02:57,649
and this strip of purple that you see

78
00:02:55,789 --> 00:03:00,019
are all the grape vineyards that are in

79
00:02:57,650 --> 00:03:03,080
western New York so majority of the

80
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:05,959
grapes that are grown in New York are in

81
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:07,400
that Delft so you talk a lot about the

82
00:03:05,959 --> 00:03:10,129
Finger Lakes since you're so close to

83
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:12,550
this region Long Island Lake Champlain

84
00:03:10,129 --> 00:03:16,039
region different grape growing areas in

85
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:18,050
western New York but in in western New

86
00:03:16,039 --> 00:03:19,579
York sorry in western New York we have

87
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:22,939
this lake plane right up against Lake

88
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:24,650
Erie so we're influenced by the lake

89
00:03:22,939 --> 00:03:26,989
effect that we get from from Lake Erie

90
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:28,520
it moderates our temperature in the

91
00:03:26,989 --> 00:03:30,200
region and that's why we can grow tender

92
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:33,020
fruit production in grapes being one of

93
00:03:30,199 --> 00:03:34,879
them as that expand it out to all of the

94
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:36,680
Great Lakes so we have a primary

95
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:39,139
influence of Lake Erie on our grape

96
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:41,090
growing region but really and this is a

97
00:03:39,139 --> 00:03:42,559
something that Stan Howell for Michigan

98
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:44,750
State used to tell me is that we have a

99
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,879
broader influence of all the Great Lakes

100
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:48,709
so as those cold air masses come down

101
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:51,139
from Canada it crosses all that water

102
00:03:48,709 --> 00:03:53,239
that air gets conditioned and that's how

103
00:03:51,139 --> 00:03:54,829
why we can grow tender fruit so it

104
00:03:53,239 --> 00:03:56,709
doesn't get that cold in the winter

105
00:03:54,830 --> 00:04:00,469
we have about a hundred and eighty

106
00:03:56,709 --> 00:04:02,569
frost-free days in the region and then

107
00:04:00,469 --> 00:04:04,400
there was that increase in elevation we

108
00:04:02,569 --> 00:04:06,739
call that the Allegheny plateau the

109
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:09,140
escarpment you know the guys on the

110
00:04:06,739 --> 00:04:12,439
Weather Channel's call it the the

111
00:04:09,139 --> 00:04:14,359
Chautauqua ridge of Chautauqua County

112
00:04:12,439 --> 00:04:16,759
this is Chautauqua County the Chautauqua

113
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:18,739
ridge that rise in elevation so when you

114
00:04:16,759 --> 00:04:20,750
talk about lake effect snow we get all

115
00:04:18,738 --> 00:04:23,120
the lake effect snow I mean it's not

116
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:24,829
uncommon for our region down on the lake

117
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:27,290
plane to get over a hundred inches of

118
00:04:24,829 --> 00:04:30,050
snow a year if you go up that hill they

119
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:31,730
get about 200 inches of snow so again

120
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:33,280
just shows you that link influence that

121
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:36,890
we have in the area

122
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:38,750
okay the Concorde industry so one of the

123
00:04:36,889 --> 00:04:41,089
reasons I actually even have a position

124
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:42,889
at Cornell is for the concord juice

125
00:04:41,089 --> 00:04:45,339
grape industry in western new york so

126
00:04:42,889 --> 00:04:47,870
you hear about Welch's or you go to

127
00:04:45,339 --> 00:04:51,349
Wegmans and you buy Wegmans concord

128
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:54,649
grape jelly right it's coming from us so

129
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:56,600
in New York State and I do cheat here a

130
00:04:54,649 --> 00:04:59,329
little bit because this piece of the pie

131
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:02,689
does include the concord vineyards that

132
00:04:59,329 --> 00:05:05,750
are in Pennsylvania as well because it

133
00:05:02,689 --> 00:05:07,160
goes down closer to Erie Pennsylvania so

134
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:09,019
a majority of the grapes grown in New

135
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:11,000
York are concord so you talk about all

136
00:05:09,019 --> 00:05:13,099
the wineries that are in the Finger

137
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,949
Lakes and Long Island Hudson Valley they

138
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:17,930
actually make up a small percentage of

139
00:05:14,949 --> 00:05:20,930
the total production of grapes so and

140
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:22,939
they're different markets to concord we

141
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:24,829
do on an international market right

142
00:05:22,939 --> 00:05:27,110
Welch's is trying to out-compete with

143
00:05:24,829 --> 00:05:30,019
orange juice and apple juice and there's

144
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:31,910
that economic impact there where most of

145
00:05:30,019 --> 00:05:33,259
the wineries are very successfully

146
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:33,680
selling all their product out the front

147
00:05:33,259 --> 00:05:37,189
door

148
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:38,990
so Concorde is very big but it has very

149
00:05:37,189 --> 00:05:40,969
low profit margins so if you look at the

150
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:42,168
price paid for Concorde compared to

151
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:45,050
other wine grape region

152
00:05:42,168 --> 00:05:47,479
wine grape varieties in the state we're

153
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:49,009
bottom dollar right about $200 a ton

154
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:52,879
where Riesling might be getting a

155
00:05:49,009 --> 00:05:55,399
thousand dollars or more so so our

156
00:05:52,879 --> 00:06:00,159
growers have low profit margins and we

157
00:05:55,399 --> 00:06:03,729
have become increasingly mechanized and

158
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:05,680
here's my specific problem we're gonna

159
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:08,110
try to answer with general precision

160
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:11,110
agriculture you have conquered growers

161
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:13,270
they grow a lot of grapes can't just say

162
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:14,980
Oh conquer is not making any money we're

163
00:06:13,269 --> 00:06:17,680
gonna start growing trim a net right if

164
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:18,879
one Concord grower with 200 acres plants

165
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,620
and all the tram Annette we've just

166
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:24,100
flooded the trevenant market for the

167
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:26,949
rest of the country so we're kind of

168
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:28,540
stuck with Concord as an industry and

169
00:06:26,949 --> 00:06:29,860
we're trying we're getting rock bottom

170
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:31,360
dollars so for them to make a profit

171
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:34,050
they have to become more efficient we're

172
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:36,370
getting more mechanized so the the

173
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:38,740
concept that they have adopted in our

174
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:40,780
industry is that we leave more fruiting

175
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:42,579
buds and the vines could handle right I

176
00:06:40,779 --> 00:06:45,549
want to set a very high crop potential

177
00:06:42,579 --> 00:06:47,979
the way I want to be is to have high

178
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:49,689
crops I try to set that high crop

179
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:52,330
potential by leaving more fruiting buds

180
00:06:49,689 --> 00:06:53,860
than I need and then I get past frost so

181
00:06:52,329 --> 00:06:55,750
all those shoots come out those shoots

182
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:58,689
have clusters on them if we get frost

183
00:06:55,750 --> 00:07:00,670
that reduces the crop size so it's risk

184
00:06:58,689 --> 00:07:02,740
management strategy against mother

185
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:04,900
nature leave more fruiting buds than I

186
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:07,150
need and if I get past the threat of

187
00:07:04,899 --> 00:07:08,859
spring frost I can SS do I want all

188
00:07:07,149 --> 00:07:11,289
those fruiting shoots out there or not I

189
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:13,680
can use mechanical chute thinning this

190
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:17,890
is so this is a mechanical fruit fruit

191
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:20,530
mechanical crooner for grapevines so I

192
00:07:17,889 --> 00:07:22,269
would say over 50% of our vineyards now

193
00:07:20,529 --> 00:07:24,129
at least do some kind of mechanical pre

194
00:07:22,269 --> 00:07:25,810
pruning with a hand follow up again

195
00:07:24,129 --> 00:07:27,610
leave more buds than we need then we can

196
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:29,560
assess how many fruiting shoots we have

197
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:32,860
we want to reduce those throughout the

198
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:34,480
vineyard shoot positioning is a canopy

199
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:36,819
management process we use and then also

200
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:38,919
we use a mechanical grape Harvester to

201
00:07:36,819 --> 00:07:40,719
thin fruit in the middle of the season

202
00:07:38,918 --> 00:07:42,490
to try to match the crop with the

203
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,680
growing season and then we also use that

204
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:48,160
and then mechanical harvester during

205
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:51,250
harvest time to pick the fruit and what

206
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:52,840
we're doing uniform management and

207
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:54,850
non-uniform system so we're using all

208
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:56,349
these machines uniformly across the

209
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:57,700
vineyard right I take my mechanical

210
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:59,830
pruner or my paint canticle shoot

211
00:07:57,699 --> 00:08:02,050
thinner and I just set the Machine up to

212
00:07:59,829 --> 00:08:03,729
do one thing and the grower drives up

213
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:06,310
and down and what we're doing with the

214
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:07,930
precision AG is use spatial data to talk

215
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:10,538
to these machines and make the machines

216
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:12,610
either speed up or slow down as it's

217
00:08:10,538 --> 00:08:14,279
going through the vineyard to reach our

218
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:17,650
crop load

219
00:08:14,279 --> 00:08:19,509
okay so what do I need by crop load it's

220
00:08:17,649 --> 00:08:22,750
a model based on a hundred years of

221
00:08:19,509 --> 00:08:24,849
research that was mostly labor intensive

222
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:26,529
so we talk about crop load as a revised

223
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:29,280
index Oh something very specific to us

224
00:08:26,529 --> 00:08:32,228
crop mass the pruning mass ratio and

225
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:36,478
what do we mean by pruning mass so in

226
00:08:32,229 --> 00:08:39,729
the winter so one of a very

227
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:43,930
labor-intensive but fairly accurate way

228
00:08:39,729 --> 00:08:46,180
of measuring how much vegetation the

229
00:08:43,929 --> 00:08:47,979
plant grew the year before and what it's

230
00:08:46,179 --> 00:08:49,750
cropping potential is for the next year

231
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:52,000
is to measure that through pruning wait

232
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:54,100
because pruning wait is directly related

233
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:58,509
to leaf area so getting out a

234
00:08:54,100 --> 00:09:00,070
horticultural background soil water and

235
00:08:58,509 --> 00:09:01,809
nutrient availability and the ability of

236
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:03,910
that plant to pick up water nutrients

237
00:09:01,809 --> 00:09:05,559
will impart vigor on the vine right so

238
00:09:03,909 --> 00:09:07,659
how much light interception per unit

239
00:09:05,559 --> 00:09:09,429
land area we're getting translates to

240
00:09:07,659 --> 00:09:11,889
productivity and we actually measure

241
00:09:09,429 --> 00:09:14,799
that as pruning weight why don't we

242
00:09:11,889 --> 00:09:17,230
measure leaf area directly we should we

243
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:20,109
don't it's difficult to do it's easier

244
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:22,300
to do it through pruning weight crop

245
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:24,610
weight is also something that is crop

246
00:09:22,299 --> 00:09:26,199
estimation and trying to get crop total

247
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:28,330
total crop weights gonna be at the end

248
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:31,330
of the year also pretty difficult we're

249
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:33,490
trying to answer that with sensors so

250
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:37,300
when I say in that sentence I want to

251
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:39,909
measure spatially soil pruning weight

252
00:09:37,299 --> 00:09:41,259
and crop weight characteristics

253
00:09:39,909 --> 00:09:43,240
spatially throughout the vineyard I'm

254
00:09:41,259 --> 00:09:46,960
putting all of those things into my crop

255
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:49,000
load model and we have a crop load model

256
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:53,290
I'm not gonna talk like for three

257
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:55,509
sessions about this but let me summarize

258
00:09:53,289 --> 00:09:57,250
by saying an over cropped vine is bad

259
00:09:55,509 --> 00:09:58,870
and under crock vine is bad and a

260
00:09:57,250 --> 00:10:00,490
balanced vine is good and fit of

261
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:02,740
cultures across the world talk about

262
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:04,899
buying balance or vineyard balance and

263
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:06,549
all that really is saying is I want to

264
00:10:04,899 --> 00:10:08,319
match my crop size with the amount of

265
00:10:06,549 --> 00:10:11,019
leaf area I have out there and with my

266
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:13,030
growing season and we really have this

267
00:10:11,019 --> 00:10:15,279
down with Concord again I leave more

268
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:17,289
crop than I need at about 30 days after

269
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:18,669
bloom I'm assessing what my season is

270
00:10:17,289 --> 00:10:20,980
and what my crop size is and I'm

271
00:10:18,669 --> 00:10:24,399
adjusting that crop to match this crop

272
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:26,320
load ratio and we tend up again over

273
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:28,120
cropper vines we leave way too much

274
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:31,480
fruit and then we try to dial it back so

275
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:33,549
we're playing whoo we're playing up here

276
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:35,649
in the over crop situation and we try to

277
00:10:33,549 --> 00:10:36,129
bring them into balance with our

278
00:10:35,649 --> 00:10:39,490
machines

279
00:10:36,129 --> 00:10:41,740
okay so to develop multiple sensing

280
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:43,899
automation solutions for soil canopy and

281
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:45,269
crop and then reconstitute those with

282
00:10:43,899 --> 00:10:47,259
our machines to do very very

283
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:50,029
applications to hit our crop load

284
00:10:47,259 --> 00:10:53,029
balance within a vineyard

285
00:10:50,029 --> 00:10:54,409
okay so we have a viticulturist you know

286
00:10:53,029 --> 00:10:58,339
three guys walk into a bar

287
00:10:54,409 --> 00:11:00,110
a viticulturist robotics engineer and a

288
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:01,580
precision AG specialist and they all

289
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:03,409
start talking about different things

290
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:05,480
which they're really talking about the

291
00:11:03,409 --> 00:11:08,569
same thing so so one of the things about

292
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:10,610
this large scri USDA funded project we

293
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:11,900
had is a multidisciplinary and trying to

294
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:13,879
get people in the same room talking the

295
00:11:11,899 --> 00:11:15,949
same language and we come up with this

296
00:11:13,879 --> 00:11:17,899
measure model manage or sense plan act

297
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:19,100
data information decisions right so each

298
00:11:17,899 --> 00:11:20,870
one of these guys is talking about

299
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:22,790
something a little bit different but

300
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:24,769
really talking the same language we want

301
00:11:22,789 --> 00:11:26,569
to measure soil canopy in crop we want

302
00:11:24,769 --> 00:11:27,949
to model what our crop load is and then

303
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:31,190
we want to manage that through

304
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:32,210
mechanization so we break it the project

305
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:34,540
down into measure

306
00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:37,070
so again soil canopy crop sensors and

307
00:11:34,539 --> 00:11:40,069
validation of those sensors you're gonna

308
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:42,800
hear me say validation a lot by taking

309
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:44,480
NDVI sensor which we use to try to get

310
00:11:42,799 --> 00:11:47,659
an assessment of canopy growth and light

311
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:49,730
interception that NDVI sensors just

312
00:11:47,659 --> 00:11:52,159
giving me an electric signal right it's

313
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:55,970
giving me you know this colorful heat

314
00:11:52,159 --> 00:11:58,069
map that just I don't know what 0.7 NDVI

315
00:11:55,970 --> 00:12:00,170
really translate to viticultural II so

316
00:11:58,070 --> 00:12:01,820
we go out and we do stratified manual

317
00:12:00,169 --> 00:12:04,969
samples in the vineyard against our

318
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:08,030
sensor measurements to translate that

319
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:09,560
NDVI signal into a pruning wait map and

320
00:12:08,029 --> 00:12:13,850
then now that means something to me as a

321
00:12:09,559 --> 00:12:16,579
grower in terms of modeling so multi

322
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:18,830
data layer processing so there's really

323
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:20,720
I look at modeling in two ways one is

324
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:22,339
how do we make the most out of those

325
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:24,440
spatial data right there's a lot of

326
00:12:22,339 --> 00:12:26,990
noise in the spatial data there's a lot

327
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:27,860
of natural variation from vine to vine

328
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:29,450
in the vineyard

329
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:31,279
we're trying to pull out what the

330
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:33,530
underlying growth pattern is that in

331
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:34,939
your toe there are ways to process that

332
00:12:33,529 --> 00:12:37,639
spatial data to try to pull that

333
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:40,220
information out and then as I explained

334
00:12:37,639 --> 00:12:42,710
we're trying to also model crop load so

335
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:44,690
how does soil canopy and crop work

336
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:48,290
together for crop load balance in the

337
00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:50,510
vineyard and then manage and software

338
00:12:48,289 --> 00:12:52,549
hardware you know we're trying to take

339
00:12:50,509 --> 00:12:55,700
spatial data through a computer and

340
00:12:52,549 --> 00:12:58,189
control the mechanism on a machine so

341
00:12:55,700 --> 00:13:00,470
that takes some engineering and variable

342
00:12:58,190 --> 00:13:02,390
rate applications so as we apply those

343
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:02,990
variable rates how is it impacting our

344
00:13:02,389 --> 00:13:07,309
growth

345
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:10,070
to be in the vineyard okay for soil we

346
00:13:07,309 --> 00:13:12,199
use what we call a dual eeehm it's a m38

347
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:13,820
guys are all soil scientists you guys

348
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:17,089
know what I'm talking about because I

349
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:20,000
don't really understand it that well it

350
00:13:17,089 --> 00:13:23,810
uses electromagnetic induction to give

351
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:25,278
you this is a dual e/m it oscillates

352
00:13:23,809 --> 00:13:28,250
back and forth to give us a shallow and

353
00:13:25,278 --> 00:13:30,919
a deep reading right so we hook this

354
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:33,049
sensor on a sled drive it through the

355
00:13:30,919 --> 00:13:35,000
vineyard and we get a map it measures

356
00:13:33,049 --> 00:13:38,149
electrical conductivity and magnetic

357
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:40,129
susceptibility at two deaths and does

358
00:13:38,149 --> 00:13:41,629
that really mean again this is a sensor

359
00:13:40,129 --> 00:13:43,399
measurement it's an electric signal

360
00:13:41,629 --> 00:13:45,110
anything that conducts electricity in

361
00:13:43,399 --> 00:13:47,899
the soil is gonna you know change the

362
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:49,430
way that sensor is giving me data what

363
00:13:47,899 --> 00:13:51,230
I'm really interested in is the

364
00:13:49,429 --> 00:13:52,729
viticulturist is that it gives me a map

365
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:55,970
right it gives me a heat map of that

366
00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:57,440
vineyard and now I can I can break that

367
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:59,240
vineyard up into zones and I can

368
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:01,790
stratify my soil samples against it

369
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:03,769
right our guys do soil sampling but they

370
00:14:01,789 --> 00:14:05,778
do it randomly right I'm gonna go out to

371
00:14:03,769 --> 00:14:08,689
block H and I'm gonna take two soil

372
00:14:05,778 --> 00:14:11,000
samples there's no direction in where

373
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:12,620
they're taking that soil sample at at

374
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,708
the moment by using one of these maps

375
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:18,470
they can be more directed and then you

376
00:14:15,708 --> 00:14:20,299
know if the blue area makes up 40% of

377
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:22,310
the vineyard and say the orange area

378
00:14:20,299 --> 00:14:23,870
makes up 60% now they can start having a

379
00:14:22,309 --> 00:14:29,119
weighted average by what their soil is

380
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:31,220
like in that vineyard and mostly we look

381
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:35,120
at shallow electrical conductivity

382
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:37,790
because that has it's usually the clay

383
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:40,100
the type of clay and the amount of clay

384
00:14:37,789 --> 00:14:41,899
that's in that shallow profile that's

385
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:42,889
having the most influence on our concord

386
00:14:41,899 --> 00:14:44,929
vineyards why is that

387
00:14:42,889 --> 00:14:47,059
well from a horticultural standpoint

388
00:14:44,929 --> 00:14:50,778
owner did concord tend to be a shallow

389
00:14:47,059 --> 00:14:52,278
rooted so the world of viticulture you

390
00:14:50,778 --> 00:14:54,320
can use a rootstock and rootstocks have

391
00:14:52,278 --> 00:14:55,610
different root growth habits there are

392
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:58,100
some root stocks that go straight down

393
00:14:55,610 --> 00:15:00,230
there are ones that spread concord on

394
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:01,610
rooted tends to spread so that makes a

395
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:04,550
lot of sense to me that the amount of

396
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:07,039
clay content an organic matter and soil

397
00:15:04,549 --> 00:15:08,479
PH and the upper profile of the soil is

398
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:11,299
going to have an influence on our vine

399
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:15,440
growth and production but a map like

400
00:15:11,299 --> 00:15:17,778
this starts directing me to take samples

401
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:20,060
and be able to validate what's going on

402
00:15:17,778 --> 00:15:21,889
in the vineyard so and for the most part

403
00:15:20,059 --> 00:15:24,559
you know you get a County soil map and

404
00:15:21,889 --> 00:15:26,509
when you use the soil sensor you're

405
00:15:24,559 --> 00:15:28,539
getting a little bit more detailed maps

406
00:15:26,509 --> 00:15:32,649
to work off of

407
00:15:28,539 --> 00:15:34,659
and in our region so I showed that map

408
00:15:32,649 --> 00:15:37,269
Lake Erie and the escarpment everything

409
00:15:34,659 --> 00:15:38,889
is in the lake plane and those actually

410
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:41,799
from the lake to the escarpment is a

411
00:15:38,889 --> 00:15:44,199
series of ancient beech ridges so like

412
00:15:41,799 --> 00:15:45,579
every 30 feet of soil type changes and

413
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:47,680
we can start picking that up with that

414
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:49,710
soil sensor and as impact on our

415
00:15:47,679 --> 00:15:52,919
management

416
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:54,960
for a canopy we use NDVI so normalized

417
00:15:52,919 --> 00:15:57,659
difference vegetation index and it's

418
00:15:54,960 --> 00:16:02,490
really using red and near-infrared wave

419
00:15:57,659 --> 00:16:05,459
bands on a sensor so you can get NDVI

420
00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:07,879
from a drone you get it from airplane

421
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:09,810
you can get it from a satellite we use

422
00:16:07,879 --> 00:16:11,669
pretty much when we started the project

423
00:16:09,809 --> 00:16:14,609
we're like what's cheap and easy so we

424
00:16:11,669 --> 00:16:17,129
can buy these NDVI sensors there used to

425
00:16:14,610 --> 00:16:20,100
be one called a green seeker that was

426
00:16:17,129 --> 00:16:22,220
part of an tech tech and technologies

427
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:26,990
now I think it's bought off by Trimble

428
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:29,700
we use crop circle this crop circle

429
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:31,919
sensor has three wave bands so it's

430
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:33,450
sending out white light hitting the

431
00:16:31,919 --> 00:16:36,049
leaves the leaves are reflecting the

432
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:39,720
light back and we're sensing with

433
00:16:36,049 --> 00:16:41,609
near-infrared red and red edge and we

434
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:44,129
can use those three wave bands to come

435
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:46,409
up with different plant indices what I'm

436
00:16:44,129 --> 00:16:47,939
really looking for from my standpoint is

437
00:16:46,409 --> 00:16:51,778
is there a leaf there or not I need the

438
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:53,940
next video how explain that so so NDVI

439
00:16:51,778 --> 00:16:55,289
is just a way to measure israel are

440
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:57,150
their leaves there and what's the health

441
00:16:55,289 --> 00:16:58,889
of the leaf we put it up against the

442
00:16:57,149 --> 00:17:00,539
canopy because I want to know where the

443
00:16:58,889 --> 00:17:02,189
vines are growing very strong and where

444
00:17:00,539 --> 00:17:04,819
the vines are growing very weak how that

445
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:04,820
changes throughout

446
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:12,050
so this is the old green seeker

447
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:13,789
beautiful really slow here's the crop

448
00:17:12,049 --> 00:17:15,828
circle sensors that we're using now say

449
00:17:13,789 --> 00:17:18,470
the three wave bands are go through

450
00:17:15,828 --> 00:17:19,818
there that's a Gallo vineyard that's a

451
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:21,529
table grape vineyard so this is a

452
00:17:19,818 --> 00:17:23,328
national project where you working in

453
00:17:21,529 --> 00:17:26,180
vineyards both here in New York in

454
00:17:23,328 --> 00:17:28,250
California that's a merlot vineyard in

455
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:31,009
California okay here's a here's a

456
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:33,558
vineyard in Michigan so this gives you a

457
00:17:31,009 --> 00:17:36,049
good idea where the canopy was very

458
00:17:33,558 --> 00:17:37,549
sparse we're gonna get low NDVI values

459
00:17:36,049 --> 00:17:39,889
and now it's here where it's very thick

460
00:17:37,549 --> 00:17:42,440
we're gonna get higher NDVI values and

461
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:43,940
we get again we get maps like this where

462
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:45,920
it's showing me where their vines are

463
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:48,980
are pretty weak and where the vines are

464
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:51,830
pretty strong so in terms of Concord

465
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:54,259
outward horticulture again high wire

466
00:17:51,829 --> 00:17:56,000
cord on the shoots come out and then

467
00:17:54,259 --> 00:17:57,140
they droop down which it might be

468
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,630
different than a lot of the vineyards

469
00:17:57,140 --> 00:18:01,610
you'll see around here with like

470
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:03,290
Riesling would be a low wire cordon with

471
00:18:01,609 --> 00:18:05,029
upward growth habit and things are put

472
00:18:03,289 --> 00:18:07,279
up and do catch wires so you have a

473
00:18:05,029 --> 00:18:10,160
vertical chute position system so we

474
00:18:07,279 --> 00:18:11,660
work on both but here in Concord if

475
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:13,850
early in the season this makes a lot of

476
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:15,259
sense we use one sensor we used to use

477
00:18:13,849 --> 00:18:17,449
an array of sensors that didn't really

478
00:18:15,259 --> 00:18:19,279
help us out we use one sensor here and

479
00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:22,100
as that vine grows throughout the season

480
00:18:19,279 --> 00:18:24,319
we actually drop the sensor so I know if

481
00:18:22,099 --> 00:18:26,389
one vine is growing very very strong

482
00:18:24,319 --> 00:18:28,730
right this is the sensor will saturate

483
00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:30,950
if I still have week vines Anila season

484
00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:33,230
I'm gonna mean getting lower signatures

485
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:35,090
so again really we're just seeing are

486
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:36,349
there leaves there or not and it has a

487
00:18:35,089 --> 00:18:37,909
little bit to do with the health of leaf

488
00:18:36,349 --> 00:18:40,159
but we don't really address that too

489
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:42,370
much at this point although that's on

490
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,370
the horizon

491
00:18:43,549 --> 00:18:50,399
okay validate validate validate so again

492
00:18:46,759 --> 00:18:53,400
we take a heat map we take man so we'll

493
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:55,080
stratify samples based on that map this

494
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:57,360
is a guy collecting pruning weights and

495
00:18:55,079 --> 00:18:59,189
the so again we either through machine

496
00:18:57,359 --> 00:19:00,869
or by hand you prune a vineyard you

497
00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:02,640
actually pick up the sticks and you

498
00:19:00,869 --> 00:19:04,319
weigh them it's a very labor-intensive

499
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:06,300
process nobody wants to do it in the

500
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:07,710
middle of February one of the reasons I

501
00:19:06,299 --> 00:19:10,200
started this project as I said I never

502
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:12,210
wanted to printing weights ever again

503
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:17,640
and now I take more pruning weights than

504
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:19,319
ever before so we look for those

505
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:21,240
relationships what is a relationship

506
00:19:19,319 --> 00:19:23,369
between vine sizes the pruning weight

507
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:26,339
and our NDVI signature and the vineyard

508
00:19:23,369 --> 00:19:28,229
so I can translate this color map that's

509
00:19:26,339 --> 00:19:29,819
an NDVI map into an actual pruning

510
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:33,390
weight map and I use that my pruning

511
00:19:29,819 --> 00:19:34,950
where my crop load formula and we do the

512
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:38,009
same thing with growers right so we have

513
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:39,720
we actually have a a loner sensor

514
00:19:38,009 --> 00:19:41,460
programmer now so as growers are out

515
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:44,610
spraying their vineyards or mowing their

516
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:46,259
vineyards or applying fertilizer they

517
00:19:44,609 --> 00:19:49,349
can they can put one of these sensors on

518
00:19:46,259 --> 00:19:50,879
their tractor collect data for us they

519
00:19:49,349 --> 00:19:53,939
come back to us we process the data

520
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:55,530
we'll give them the map will define

521
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:57,029
where the transects are that they can

522
00:19:55,529 --> 00:19:58,950
take their validation measurements and

523
00:19:57,029 --> 00:20:01,319
then so every vineyard at their own like

524
00:19:58,950 --> 00:20:04,590
internal standard for what their NDVI to

525
00:20:01,319 --> 00:20:06,750
pruning weight relationship is so we're

526
00:20:04,589 --> 00:20:08,849
turning a pretty picture this pretty

527
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:11,099
picture of NDVI actual into a pruning

528
00:20:08,849 --> 00:20:13,500
wait map and when you talk to growers

529
00:20:11,099 --> 00:20:15,569
you know one-pound by and 2 pi by 3

530
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:18,619
pound by means something to them more

531
00:20:15,569 --> 00:20:22,579
than an NDVI value crowd

532
00:20:18,619 --> 00:20:24,739
estimation so the industry is very hot

533
00:20:22,579 --> 00:20:26,750
on this topic of prop estimation I want

534
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:28,640
to know midseason either destructively

535
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:30,859
or non destructively what my harvest

536
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:33,920
weight is gonna be they want to know

537
00:20:30,859 --> 00:20:35,509
within 5% and if you're dealing with a

538
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:37,039
five acre vineyard yeah you probably do

539
00:20:35,509 --> 00:20:38,569
that when you're dealing with 30,000

540
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:41,180
acres it's a really difficult question

541
00:20:38,569 --> 00:20:44,299
ask because there's so much variation

542
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:47,799
out there soil management buying growth

543
00:20:44,299 --> 00:20:50,058
are all impacting me traditionally a

544
00:20:47,799 --> 00:20:51,678
viticulturist throughout the season will

545
00:20:50,058 --> 00:20:53,509
measure what we call yield components

546
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:56,420
they'll do it manually sampling

547
00:20:53,509 --> 00:20:58,369
typically random can we make that better

548
00:20:56,420 --> 00:21:00,500
by stratifying our samples we think so

549
00:20:58,369 --> 00:21:02,359
but they will measure shoot counts

550
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:04,369
because all these shoots have clusters

551
00:21:02,359 --> 00:21:05,959
on them so number of shoots will relate

552
00:21:04,369 --> 00:21:06,549
to what your total crop way it's gonna

553
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:09,440
be

554
00:21:06,549 --> 00:21:14,000
clusters per shoot or cluster count bury

555
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:16,519
count so a Concorde flower cluster may

556
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:19,130
have a hundred florets on them and about

557
00:21:16,519 --> 00:21:23,089
thirty of those will set well some years

558
00:21:19,130 --> 00:21:25,100
it's 25% some years that's 35% right so

559
00:21:23,089 --> 00:21:27,259
it'll change so knowing what the berry

560
00:21:25,099 --> 00:21:28,939
count per cluster is and then berry size

561
00:21:27,259 --> 00:21:30,650
so these yield components shoots per

562
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:32,600
vine clusters for shoot berries per

563
00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:35,920
cluster and berry size all impact what

564
00:21:32,599 --> 00:21:38,269
our final process timet is going to be

565
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:39,650
we are working with engineers at

566
00:21:38,269 --> 00:21:42,079
Carnegie Mellon who have developed this

567
00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:46,550
image analysis system so they take this

568
00:21:42,079 --> 00:21:48,980
red machine it's a stereo image called

569
00:21:46,549 --> 00:21:51,079
the shiny red bike it goes through the

570
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:52,610
vineyard and it takes pictures of the

571
00:21:51,079 --> 00:21:55,069
vine so at different times of the season

572
00:21:52,609 --> 00:21:57,409
when it's you know early season shoots

573
00:21:55,069 --> 00:21:59,808
or mid season cluster counts or berry

574
00:21:57,410 --> 00:22:01,308
counts or berry sized it stitches those

575
00:21:59,808 --> 00:22:03,079
images together and then they use

576
00:22:01,308 --> 00:22:07,910
algorithms to count what's in those

577
00:22:03,079 --> 00:22:10,669
images and so far it works very well at

578
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:12,290
counting what it can see it doesn't do a

579
00:22:10,670 --> 00:22:15,019
very good job counting what it can't see

580
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:17,029
so if you're trying to count berries on

581
00:22:15,019 --> 00:22:19,400
a cluster if those clusters are exposed

582
00:22:17,029 --> 00:22:20,509
like in a vertical chute position system

583
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:22,309
where the leaves are pulled and the

584
00:22:20,509 --> 00:22:24,769
clusters are hanging out there it's very

585
00:22:22,308 --> 00:22:26,779
accurate accounting varies but then you

586
00:22:24,769 --> 00:22:28,940
also have berries hiding other berries

587
00:22:26,779 --> 00:22:31,759
so they deal with this occlusion factor

588
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:32,390
or visibility factor so they're trying

589
00:22:31,759 --> 00:22:34,759
to measure

590
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:37,580
yield components identifying what

591
00:22:34,759 --> 00:22:40,309
there's some other occlusion factors are

592
00:22:37,579 --> 00:22:42,259
and then they try to try to make a crop

593
00:22:40,309 --> 00:22:45,329
estimate based on that okay here's a

594
00:22:42,259 --> 00:22:46,980
video of the thing in action

595
00:22:45,329 --> 00:22:49,439
we will use it during the dormant season

596
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:52,230
thinking they're trying to developed

597
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:55,140
algorithms to count buds so dormant buds

598
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:57,750
and then shoots and they work in table

599
00:22:55,140 --> 00:23:00,480
grapes looking at color development so

600
00:22:57,750 --> 00:23:02,250
this thing goes down it flashes we use

601
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:03,750
stuff like leaf blowers to try to get

602
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:06,240
the leaves out of the way so we can take

603
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:08,429
pictures of the fruit this is a merlot

604
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:10,528
vineyard in California so again this is

605
00:23:08,429 --> 00:23:12,269
this is what is taking a picture of this

606
00:23:10,528 --> 00:23:13,769
is what it is going through its

607
00:23:12,269 --> 00:23:16,139
algorithms to count the fruit that's

608
00:23:13,769 --> 00:23:17,609
there and then it's developing a spatial

609
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:20,610
map of very counter process that

610
00:23:17,609 --> 00:23:22,469
vineyard and then we validate that with

611
00:23:20,609 --> 00:23:27,898
yield monitors I'll talk about that in a

612
00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:29,850
second so a here's their CMU imaging a

613
00:23:27,898 --> 00:23:31,979
very count in that vineyard and then the

614
00:23:29,849 --> 00:23:33,480
harvest yield monitor is what this is

615
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:35,700
what we get off of the yield monitor and

616
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:37,710
we try to look at the relationship

617
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:43,679
between those two and see how close they

618
00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:46,769
match yield monitors okay so it's all

619
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:49,230
coming together here so we're evaluating

620
00:23:46,769 --> 00:23:51,000
two yield monitors on a harvester and

621
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:52,380
this really helps with you know we have

622
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,419
a crop estimation in the middle of

623
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:56,909
season and what is our final crop weight

624
00:23:54,419 --> 00:23:59,130
at the end of the season so there's a

625
00:23:56,909 --> 00:24:00,570
yield monitor one was developed in

626
00:23:59,130 --> 00:24:01,860
Australia and then there's another one

627
00:24:00,569 --> 00:24:06,389
that was developed by a company called

628
00:24:01,859 --> 00:24:08,668
Oxbow it is sits right here the one from

629
00:24:06,390 --> 00:24:10,770
Australia on the cross conveyor so you

630
00:24:08,669 --> 00:24:12,899
ever seen a grape harvester work grape

631
00:24:10,769 --> 00:24:14,759
harvester goes over one row it shakes

632
00:24:12,898 --> 00:24:16,949
the vines the fruit falls off it goes

633
00:24:14,759 --> 00:24:19,140
over this conveyor belt into a chase

634
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:20,278
tractor into bins and those bins get put

635
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:21,809
on a trailer and then they go to the

636
00:24:20,278 --> 00:24:23,759
processing plant

637
00:24:21,808 --> 00:24:26,278
so this yield monitor has a false way

638
00:24:23,759 --> 00:24:30,119
frame and as the as the fruit goes over

639
00:24:26,278 --> 00:24:31,528
the belt it's recording a weight and we

640
00:24:30,119 --> 00:24:33,839
can map that everything's hooked up with

641
00:24:31,528 --> 00:24:37,079
GPS we also have another one called an

642
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:39,449
oxbow type Oxbow is a company that makes

643
00:24:37,079 --> 00:24:42,480
like pea harvesters and grape harvesters

644
00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:43,620
and they have an impact plate one so so

645
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:45,659
many of you are probably familiar with

646
00:24:43,619 --> 00:24:47,219
grain harvesters they use an impact

647
00:24:45,659 --> 00:24:48,720
plate as grains coming off it's hitting

648
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:50,159
a plate and then they translate that

649
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:53,480
into a yield signal we're doing the same

650
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:53,480
thing with grapes

651
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:58,799
again validation so whether it's the

652
00:24:56,910 --> 00:25:01,380
impact plate or the false way frame

653
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:03,509
we're relating the yield that's coming

654
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:05,580
off of the sensor to actual either

655
00:25:03,509 --> 00:25:07,170
bucket weights or bin weights or actual

656
00:25:05,579 --> 00:25:08,819
truck weights that go into the plant

657
00:25:07,170 --> 00:25:10,800
we're relating those to what the yield

658
00:25:08,819 --> 00:25:12,919
monitor says and we're getting nice

659
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:15,509
relationships so we can use that

660
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:17,308
something that's hot off the press so

661
00:25:15,509 --> 00:25:19,379
this image was actually made earlier

662
00:25:17,308 --> 00:25:23,700
this week during our harvest this year

663
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:25,530
is juice soluble solids mapping so grape

664
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:28,920
growers get paid for their grapes based

665
00:25:25,529 --> 00:25:31,710
on yield and sugar content juice soluble

666
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:34,050
solids something we call Brix the we

667
00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:37,350
measure refractive index of the juice

668
00:25:34,049 --> 00:25:39,419
and we call it bricks and so they get

669
00:25:37,349 --> 00:25:41,129
paid on yield and bricks right and

670
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:42,900
there's a minimum Brix level if you drop

671
00:25:41,130 --> 00:25:44,790
below that minimum bricks your load gets

672
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:46,769
rejected or you go into a low solids

673
00:25:44,789 --> 00:25:48,690
program and you get paid a lot less or

674
00:25:46,769 --> 00:25:51,179
their grapes so growers are really

675
00:25:48,690 --> 00:25:53,070
interested to know what their yield and

676
00:25:51,179 --> 00:25:54,630
their sugar content is as they're

677
00:25:53,069 --> 00:25:57,269
harvesting because if they go into a

678
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:58,710
field and the bricks are too low they

679
00:25:57,269 --> 00:26:01,349
have to go to another field and pick the

680
00:25:58,710 --> 00:26:02,970
fruit that's ripe or they do they do

681
00:26:01,349 --> 00:26:05,099
something well just doesn't want to hear

682
00:26:02,970 --> 00:26:06,990
about Kyle Field blending is they will

683
00:26:05,099 --> 00:26:08,730
put unripe fruit in a bin and then

684
00:26:06,990 --> 00:26:12,089
they'll go to a field that's ripe and

685
00:26:08,730 --> 00:26:15,420
they'll cook more sweet stuff on top and

686
00:26:12,089 --> 00:26:19,019
try to get that into the plant we're

687
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:21,960
trying to eliminate field blending so if

688
00:26:19,019 --> 00:26:24,329
we can we if we can either measure juice

689
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:26,039
soluble solids on the fly or use our

690
00:26:24,329 --> 00:26:27,960
crop load models to predict you know

691
00:26:26,039 --> 00:26:30,000
this fields gonna write them last this

692
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:31,890
one's gonna ripen earlier lets you know

693
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,960
that directs the grower to be able to go

694
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:37,830
out and pick the fruit when they need to

695
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:40,410
so okay so there are inline

696
00:26:37,829 --> 00:26:42,000
refractometers that you can purchase and

697
00:26:40,410 --> 00:26:44,340
they use them in factories and you can

698
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:47,759
measure the Brix that's not that's not

699
00:26:44,339 --> 00:26:49,019
like the development what is my crew has

700
00:26:47,759 --> 00:26:52,920
been working on and we're gonna try to

701
00:26:49,019 --> 00:26:54,929
protect the intellectual property is how

702
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:57,090
to get juice to the refractometer so

703
00:26:54,929 --> 00:26:58,500
grapes are falling off of the belt and

704
00:26:57,089 --> 00:27:00,808
you can it's very difficult to measure

705
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:03,390
the you know Brix of all that you're

706
00:27:00,808 --> 00:27:07,079
getting non soluble solids in there as

707
00:27:03,390 --> 00:27:07,990
well so skins leaves it so guys that

708
00:27:07,079 --> 00:27:09,639
I've worked with a

709
00:27:07,990 --> 00:27:11,410
have developed the processing unit that

710
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:12,880
bounced onto a harvester that actually

711
00:27:11,410 --> 00:27:15,880
samples a portion of the fruit that's

712
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:18,700
falling off of the belt and it puts it

713
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:21,010
through a mechanism that sends juice to

714
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:22,330
the refractometer refractometer reads it

715
00:27:21,009 --> 00:27:25,420
and actually the juice goes back on the

716
00:27:22,329 --> 00:27:26,710
belt to be harvested and and these are

717
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:29,380
the first maps that are coming off of

718
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:29,829
that system so we're pretty happy with

719
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:33,220
that

720
00:27:29,829 --> 00:27:34,689
okay I keep moving modeling so those

721
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:36,339
that's our measurement right we're

722
00:27:34,690 --> 00:27:40,558
measure soil canopy crop you have these

723
00:27:36,339 --> 00:27:42,519
different sensors you know do Liam NDVI

724
00:27:40,558 --> 00:27:44,558
destructive and non-destructive yield

725
00:27:42,519 --> 00:27:47,049
monitoring with the CMU imaging system

726
00:27:44,558 --> 00:27:49,599
we also have a destructive system that

727
00:27:47,049 --> 00:27:51,220
we use that we actually go out and clean

728
00:27:49,599 --> 00:27:52,719
pick fruit in the middle of season try

729
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:54,910
asked me what scent so there's there's

730
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:57,279
different ways of doing that and now

731
00:27:54,910 --> 00:27:59,019
we're we also measure you know yield and

732
00:27:57,279 --> 00:28:00,730
Brix monitoring so all those sensors are

733
00:27:59,019 --> 00:28:03,730
working together now we're talking about

734
00:28:00,730 --> 00:28:05,950
modeling of the spatial data so again

735
00:28:03,730 --> 00:28:07,509
when I first started doing this I did it

736
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:09,700
probably like most people who are

737
00:28:07,509 --> 00:28:11,769
getting into this business is you know

738
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:13,650
we have you have 40,000 data points in

739
00:28:11,769 --> 00:28:18,549
the field you project those through

740
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:19,720
ArcGIS or some other spatial program you

741
00:28:18,549 --> 00:28:22,960
know and you try to do some data

742
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:25,029
smoothing and and you get a you get a

743
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:27,789
picture that's and it's and it can be

744
00:28:25,029 --> 00:28:29,920
very useful but there is information in

745
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:34,450
that spatial data that is difficult to

746
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:36,519
get out and so we use both global very

747
00:28:34,450 --> 00:28:40,000
old Graham modeling and local very okra

748
00:28:36,519 --> 00:28:43,269
modeling to make these images and again

749
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,980
what a very Oh Graham tells us is how

750
00:28:43,269 --> 00:28:47,170
much of the variation in the vineyard is

751
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:48,789
random right so I have big and small

752
00:28:47,170 --> 00:28:50,350
vines over here but most of them are big

753
00:28:48,789 --> 00:28:52,149
I have big and small vines over here but

754
00:28:50,349 --> 00:28:55,149
most of them are small so there's a lot

755
00:28:52,150 --> 00:28:57,220
of this randomness that's going on and a

756
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:59,980
global very own gram of a field will

757
00:28:57,220 --> 00:29:03,009
tell me Oh 50% of your variation is this

758
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:04,630
random I use a word crap it's random

759
00:29:03,009 --> 00:29:06,490
crap and it's just like making noise of

760
00:29:04,630 --> 00:29:08,350
my data and then 50 percent of the

761
00:29:06,490 --> 00:29:10,599
variation is spatially structured it's

762
00:29:08,349 --> 00:29:13,329
based on oh my soil type is more clay

763
00:29:10,599 --> 00:29:15,250
over here it's more gravel over here and

764
00:29:13,329 --> 00:29:16,839
that is that that's what I want to

765
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:19,329
manage against so I want to be able to

766
00:29:16,839 --> 00:29:21,869
capture that and that's what this kind

767
00:29:19,329 --> 00:29:26,189
of modeling does for us

768
00:29:21,869 --> 00:29:28,229
so as these the smoothing technique I

769
00:29:26,190 --> 00:29:29,850
guess is the best way to say it it's

770
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:31,380
actually looking at every data point and

771
00:29:29,849 --> 00:29:34,139
it's looking at the neighbors of data

772
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:35,039
points around each one to say as I get

773
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:37,049
farther and farther away

774
00:29:35,038 --> 00:29:39,720
how are those points influencing this

775
00:29:37,048 --> 00:29:42,538
point and it smoothes that data and it

776
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:44,460
does it in in in a way in which we can

777
00:29:42,538 --> 00:29:47,369
extract the pattern out of the vineyard

778
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:49,409
and then we project so this smoothing

779
00:29:47,369 --> 00:29:51,119
process is done on a common grid so

780
00:29:49,409 --> 00:29:53,640
every and hour

781
00:29:51,119 --> 00:29:56,629
we just happen to select a grid size

782
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:59,460
that is equal to our vine density so

783
00:29:56,630 --> 00:30:03,028
it's basically every grid point equates

784
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:04,829
to a vine and I know now that I put

785
00:30:03,028 --> 00:30:06,690
project everything onto a common grid I

786
00:30:04,829 --> 00:30:08,308
can look at the soil map the canopy map

787
00:30:06,690 --> 00:30:09,840
and the crop map and I can mine through

788
00:30:08,308 --> 00:30:11,668
that data and say at this point in the

789
00:30:09,839 --> 00:30:13,589
vineyard I'm standing here all right I

790
00:30:11,669 --> 00:30:15,028
have this kind of soil it's imparting

791
00:30:13,589 --> 00:30:16,500
this kind of vine growth and I should

792
00:30:15,028 --> 00:30:19,528
probably be able to hang this kind of

793
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:22,769
crop here to get it ripe in a average

794
00:30:19,528 --> 00:30:25,819
growing season and I'm using that now to

795
00:30:22,769 --> 00:30:25,819
manage my vineyard

796
00:30:26,599 --> 00:30:30,230
so then we look at all these data so

797
00:30:28,490 --> 00:30:32,839
we're collecting all this data right so

798
00:30:30,230 --> 00:30:36,048
one of the comments that the industry

799
00:30:32,839 --> 00:30:37,668
growers will say ah I'm in California

800
00:30:36,048 --> 00:30:39,259
and I pay someone to do a flyover of my

801
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:41,179
vineyard of NDVI and I have all these

802
00:30:39,259 --> 00:30:43,370
maps sitting on my desk no idea what to

803
00:30:41,179 --> 00:30:45,080
do right that's a big issue with the

804
00:30:43,369 --> 00:30:47,989
industry is I have data I don't know

805
00:30:45,079 --> 00:30:49,668
what to do with it so what we do again

806
00:30:47,990 --> 00:30:51,829
since everything is projected down to a

807
00:30:49,669 --> 00:30:53,630
common grid I can mine to that data I

808
00:30:51,829 --> 00:30:55,339
can look for correlations between the

809
00:30:53,630 --> 00:30:57,830
soil and the canopy and the canopy in

810
00:30:55,339 --> 00:31:00,079
the crop and there are some images where

811
00:30:57,829 --> 00:31:02,658
I'm like yeah it's garbage right like

812
00:31:00,079 --> 00:31:04,250
the deep magnetic susceptibility is just

813
00:31:02,659 --> 00:31:05,629
something streaky map and it doesn't

814
00:31:04,250 --> 00:31:09,740
mean anything to me

815
00:31:05,628 --> 00:31:11,778
where say a shallow EC a midseason NDVI

816
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:14,960
and my yield map all have some kind of

817
00:31:11,778 --> 00:31:17,179
correlation that's going on I use so so

818
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:18,798
we talked about at some point in the

819
00:31:17,179 --> 00:31:20,899
process of all this we need to have the

820
00:31:18,798 --> 00:31:23,808
growers input right you need you need it

821
00:31:20,898 --> 00:31:25,878
the grower has based on their economics

822
00:31:23,808 --> 00:31:27,710
based on you know what they're growing

823
00:31:25,878 --> 00:31:29,178
in and for what fruit market they have

824
00:31:27,710 --> 00:31:30,710
their own idea what they want to do with

825
00:31:29,179 --> 00:31:32,149
the vineyard so at some point they need

826
00:31:30,710 --> 00:31:34,788
to come into the process and this is

827
00:31:32,148 --> 00:31:36,739
where they would come in to say yep I

828
00:31:34,788 --> 00:31:38,538
know there's a low spot in my vineyard

829
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:40,009
and I know that's affecting my

830
00:31:38,538 --> 00:31:43,220
productivity solely I'll leave that

831
00:31:40,009 --> 00:31:47,870
layer in and then we do we find the

832
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:50,720
layers that we want we do we call it

833
00:31:47,869 --> 00:31:53,298
k-means clustering alysus so it's taking

834
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:56,600
the data from say these four layers and

835
00:31:53,298 --> 00:31:59,089
is creating zones and it is trying to

836
00:31:56,599 --> 00:32:01,398
mean separate those zones as much as

837
00:31:59,089 --> 00:32:05,240
possible and reduce the variation within

838
00:32:01,398 --> 00:32:07,428
those zones so you have discrete zones

839
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:09,349
within a vineyard that hopefully makes

840
00:32:07,429 --> 00:32:11,419
sense viticultural e and you can also

841
00:32:09,349 --> 00:32:12,980
click on the red and it'll tell you oh

842
00:32:11,419 --> 00:32:15,259
you have this kind of soil this kind of

843
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:16,788
canopy in this kind of crop how do you

844
00:32:15,259 --> 00:32:22,419
want to manage it same thing with the

845
00:32:16,788 --> 00:32:24,158
red for the green in the blue zones okay

846
00:32:22,419 --> 00:32:25,869
we measure with all our sensors we model

847
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:27,659
that data doing the spatial data

848
00:32:25,868 --> 00:32:30,878
processing coming up with our management

849
00:32:27,659 --> 00:32:32,649
classifications and now we have to

850
00:32:30,878 --> 00:32:33,939
manage it so I'll give you best way to

851
00:32:32,648 --> 00:32:37,058
try to describe this is through an

852
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:39,639
example so here's a grower is a concord

853
00:32:37,058 --> 00:32:42,638
vineyard it has a small a medium and

854
00:32:39,638 --> 00:32:44,498
high buying growth area right and we do

855
00:32:42,638 --> 00:32:47,019
our crop estimate in middle of the

856
00:32:44,499 --> 00:32:49,720
season and we know that the red zone has

857
00:32:47,019 --> 00:32:52,450
about 8 tons per acre and but we know

858
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:55,329
those vines are really small you cannot

859
00:32:52,450 --> 00:32:57,639
you cannot ripen 8 tons per acre on that

860
00:32:55,329 --> 00:32:59,918
part of the vineyard then the Blue Zone

861
00:32:57,638 --> 00:33:03,008
are big healthy vines have more water

862
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:05,320
more nutrients they can ripen a larger

863
00:33:03,009 --> 00:33:06,940
crop and they're hanging almost 12 tons

864
00:33:05,319 --> 00:33:08,798
per acre and we're like you know what

865
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:11,440
given the growing season you probably

866
00:33:08,798 --> 00:33:13,329
can ripen on that much so I want to take

867
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:15,639
off more fruit here actually to try to

868
00:33:13,329 --> 00:33:18,220
get the small vines and balanced and the

869
00:33:15,638 --> 00:33:20,048
big ones take off a little bit I want to

870
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:22,538
leave more crop because it's able to

871
00:33:20,048 --> 00:33:25,960
ripen their crop and we do that with a

872
00:33:22,538 --> 00:33:29,230
harvester machine so so this harvester

873
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:30,519
middle of the season it is gonna it just

874
00:33:29,230 --> 00:33:32,019
like it harvest where it shakes the

875
00:33:30,519 --> 00:33:34,089
vines but it's gonna shake them more

876
00:33:32,019 --> 00:33:35,558
gently and it'll take off say I want to

877
00:33:34,089 --> 00:33:37,028
take off 2 tonnes breaker here it'll

878
00:33:35,558 --> 00:33:39,069
take it off maybe I want to take off 1

879
00:33:37,028 --> 00:33:42,279
ton per acre here it'll slow down the

880
00:33:39,069 --> 00:33:45,319
beater speed and take off less fruit

881
00:33:42,279 --> 00:33:47,299
so we have our spatial data goes into

882
00:33:45,319 --> 00:33:50,059
our map the map talks to this computer

883
00:33:47,299 --> 00:33:52,220
we use an AG leader system Trimble and

884
00:33:50,059 --> 00:33:54,529
Raven you know Chevy Ford people have

885
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:56,650
their favorites we use AG leader just

886
00:33:54,529 --> 00:34:00,769
because that's the system we work with

887
00:33:56,650 --> 00:34:04,610
so it goes into the their software so we

888
00:34:00,769 --> 00:34:06,200
actually tricked this system this is

889
00:34:04,609 --> 00:34:08,839
really meant for liquid fertilizer

890
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:11,539
application so it's all about flow rates

891
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:13,460
so we actually have to tell in the dark

892
00:34:11,539 --> 00:34:14,570
blue zone I want this flow rate and in

893
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:17,750
the light blue zone I want a different

894
00:34:14,570 --> 00:34:21,559
flow rate and instead of going to the

895
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:23,690
liquid dispense of fertilizer we send

896
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:26,329
that signal to what we call a PWM valve

897
00:34:23,690 --> 00:34:27,670
a pulse width modulation engineers are

898
00:34:26,329 --> 00:34:30,110
out there you know I'm talking about

899
00:34:27,670 --> 00:34:32,150
it's basically a hydraulic valve that

900
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:33,530
chirps the faster chirps the more

901
00:34:32,150 --> 00:34:35,420
hydraulic fluid they go through and the

902
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:37,760
faster the machine works and vice versa

903
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:40,070
as it goes slower so the map talks to

904
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:44,690
the PWM valve and then the harvester

905
00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:46,250
just goes so at crop estimation time we

906
00:34:44,690 --> 00:34:48,200
want to take off all the fruit so we

907
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:51,168
drive very slow and we shake the vines

908
00:34:48,199 --> 00:34:53,659
really hard and we harvest that fruit we

909
00:34:51,168 --> 00:34:56,000
collect and weigh it we're using that to

910
00:34:53,659 --> 00:34:57,559
do our crop estimate that's how I got to

911
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,639
the I have eight tons per acre here and

912
00:34:57,559 --> 00:35:02,500
I have 12 tons per acre somewhere else

913
00:35:00,639 --> 00:35:04,629
and then when I want to just shake off a

914
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:06,010
little bit into the different zones this

915
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:08,680
is so this isn't the throat of a

916
00:35:06,010 --> 00:35:11,079
harvester and so now we're driving much

917
00:35:08,679 --> 00:35:12,518
faster somewhere between five and six

918
00:35:11,079 --> 00:35:14,140
miles per hour through vineyard but

919
00:35:12,518 --> 00:35:17,489
shaking the vines very gently just to

920
00:35:14,139 --> 00:35:17,489
get a portion of the fruit to fall off

921
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:23,630
and then we put that into our crop load

922
00:35:22,039 --> 00:35:26,690
model remember so going way back to

923
00:35:23,630 --> 00:35:29,360
natok fruit way to pruning weight ratio

924
00:35:26,690 --> 00:35:30,769
we're using our spatial data validated

925
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:33,260
against those kind of measurements to

926
00:35:30,769 --> 00:35:35,179
come up with a harvest yield map so our

927
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:38,630
crop weight our pruning weight map based

928
00:35:35,179 --> 00:35:40,250
on NDVI we actually do the math between

929
00:35:38,630 --> 00:35:43,670
those two to come up with our crop load

930
00:35:40,250 --> 00:35:45,349
or revise index and in these strips here

931
00:35:43,670 --> 00:35:48,950
are controls where we didn't do anything

932
00:35:45,349 --> 00:35:50,960
you can pick those out so the red color

933
00:35:48,949 --> 00:35:52,939
would be over cropped and by doing

934
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:56,320
variable rate thinning within that

935
00:35:52,940 --> 00:36:00,409
vineyard if we made it more uniform so

936
00:35:56,320 --> 00:36:02,539
pre thinning we had vines in the red

937
00:36:00,409 --> 00:36:05,149
green and blue zones that were all over

938
00:36:02,539 --> 00:36:07,730
cropped so here's my revised index I'm

939
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:10,789
trying to my where I wanna be balanced

940
00:36:07,730 --> 00:36:12,949
vines are about 15 so we got stuff

941
00:36:10,789 --> 00:36:15,800
that's way up in the 3035 so these are

942
00:36:12,949 --> 00:36:17,599
way over crop but we need to bring the

943
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:19,970
Reds down more than the blues and that's

944
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:21,469
what we did so we after thinning after

945
00:36:19,969 --> 00:36:23,989
variable rate thinning we've shifted

946
00:36:21,469 --> 00:36:25,189
these population curves down so that's

947
00:36:23,989 --> 00:36:26,689
what I'm really trying to do the

948
00:36:25,190 --> 00:36:29,000
ultimate goal is I want to shift the

949
00:36:26,690 --> 00:36:30,800
population of those vines where I want

950
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:34,369
them and I want to make them more narrow

951
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:36,320
right more uniform because that's gonna

952
00:36:34,369 --> 00:36:38,029
have a lot of commercial benefit for our

953
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:41,030
grower that a they're balanced and B

954
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:42,890
they're they're not as variable so my

955
00:36:41,030 --> 00:36:46,310
fruits gonna be more uniform coming into

956
00:36:42,889 --> 00:36:49,129
the harvest okay just a couple benefits

957
00:36:46,309 --> 00:36:50,449
that we've seen so far you know I knew I

958
00:36:49,130 --> 00:36:52,070
had a problem I didn't know it was that

959
00:36:50,449 --> 00:36:53,629
big so that's like the first thing we're

960
00:36:52,070 --> 00:36:55,700
getting benefits out of just a single

961
00:36:53,630 --> 00:36:58,490
data layer whether that soil or canopy

962
00:36:55,699 --> 00:37:01,099
or crop it's giving growers an idea of

963
00:36:58,489 --> 00:37:02,929
wow I had no idea that I had that much

964
00:37:01,099 --> 00:37:05,089
variation my vineyard I didn't know I

965
00:37:02,929 --> 00:37:06,919
was losing so much money in this one

966
00:37:05,090 --> 00:37:08,930
section because my crop was too low or

967
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:11,720
my vines are too weak and I need to do

968
00:37:08,929 --> 00:37:15,169
something about it improved crop

969
00:37:11,719 --> 00:37:17,089
estimation so there's a question of crop

970
00:37:15,170 --> 00:37:19,190
estimation on an individual farm versus

971
00:37:17,090 --> 00:37:20,900
crop estimation for an industry I think

972
00:37:19,190 --> 00:37:23,210
they're two totally different questions

973
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:25,340
I think we're addressing the first one

974
00:37:23,210 --> 00:37:28,159
how do I get crop estimate in my

975
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:31,280
particular farm the goal is to be within

976
00:37:28,159 --> 00:37:33,500
5% we're using spatial data to stratify

977
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:35,780
our mid-season crop estimation

978
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:37,610
samples and that's putting us somewhere

979
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:40,160
in the five to ten percent accuracy

980
00:37:37,610 --> 00:37:42,380
range of looking in commercial vineyards

981
00:37:40,159 --> 00:37:44,089
if we use random sampling we are off

982
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:46,610
anywhere from ten to twenty three

983
00:37:44,090 --> 00:37:48,380
percent and probably somewhere around

984
00:37:46,610 --> 00:37:49,880
twenty five to thirty percent is what

985
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:51,890
the industry would say that they're off

986
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:53,750
every year about thirty percent of what

987
00:37:51,889 --> 00:37:55,489
they thought they were going to be at so

988
00:37:53,750 --> 00:37:58,219
we think the stratified sampling is

989
00:37:55,489 --> 00:38:01,039
going to give benefits to our crop

990
00:37:58,219 --> 00:38:03,429
estimation to get with the five percent

991
00:38:01,039 --> 00:38:03,429
range

992
00:38:03,519 --> 00:38:09,170
preventing just one rejected low pays

993
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:10,909
for the technology so in this case we're

994
00:38:09,170 --> 00:38:15,170
doing on-the-fly yield and Brix

995
00:38:10,909 --> 00:38:17,509
monitoring again if if I have a grower

996
00:38:15,170 --> 00:38:19,340
and I have a semi load of concord grapes

997
00:38:17,510 --> 00:38:21,110
that's worth six thousand dollars and I

998
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:23,150
goes to the plant it gets rejected or it

999
00:38:21,110 --> 00:38:25,760
goes into a low solids program I've just

1000
00:38:23,150 --> 00:38:28,579
lost a lot of money out of my operation

1001
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:31,340
so if I'm picking and I can see what's

1002
00:38:28,579 --> 00:38:32,989
going on be able to visualize the fruit

1003
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:35,420
ripeness in the field then I can prevent

1004
00:38:32,989 --> 00:38:37,519
that from happening and the technology

1005
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:39,260
to pay for itself and this is the quote

1006
00:38:37,519 --> 00:38:42,590
I love the best making a decision and

1007
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:45,080
made I saved my ass and in October so

1008
00:38:42,590 --> 00:38:47,269
this one this is actually just said to

1009
00:38:45,079 --> 00:38:48,650
me last week so one of the growers were

1010
00:38:47,269 --> 00:38:51,110
working with we were doing at the

1011
00:38:48,650 --> 00:38:51,500
variable rate shoot thinning work in his

1012
00:38:51,110 --> 00:38:54,650
vineyard

1013
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:55,190
so again left way more buds and he

1014
00:38:54,650 --> 00:38:57,710
needed

1015
00:38:55,190 --> 00:39:00,409
we went out did early season NDVI

1016
00:38:57,710 --> 00:39:02,449
related at shoot count so then and he

1017
00:39:00,409 --> 00:39:04,789
had idea oh I want to leave about 120

1018
00:39:02,449 --> 00:39:06,230
shoots in this vineyard maybe less on

1019
00:39:04,789 --> 00:39:08,029
these vines more on this vise we did a

1020
00:39:06,230 --> 00:39:09,980
variable rate shoot thinning trial in

1021
00:39:08,030 --> 00:39:11,660
May so he got passed that thread of

1022
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:13,309
spring frost could assess what his crops

1023
00:39:11,659 --> 00:39:16,190
gonna be you variable rate crop

1024
00:39:13,309 --> 00:39:17,840
adjustment at that time and he did it

1025
00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:19,309
there's one field where we did the

1026
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:21,110
experiment in there was another field

1027
00:39:19,309 --> 00:39:22,909
where he didn't do the experiment in and

1028
00:39:21,110 --> 00:39:24,829
he could that fruit was just not getting

1029
00:39:22,909 --> 00:39:27,409
rifles we've had a lot of rain this fall

1030
00:39:24,829 --> 00:39:30,079
so the sugar went up and it's kind of

1031
00:39:27,409 --> 00:39:32,480
just kind of hung out there and he went

1032
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:34,069
to pick that field couldn't get it right

1033
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:35,389
went over to the field where we did the

1034
00:39:34,070 --> 00:39:38,450
variable rate shoot thinning it was able

1035
00:39:35,389 --> 00:39:39,980
to take down load so he said that you

1036
00:39:38,449 --> 00:39:42,819
know at least on that particular day the

1037
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:42,820
technology safe

1038
00:39:46,170 --> 00:40:09,430
so who so thank you for listening yes

1039
00:40:05,679 --> 00:40:10,690
so Julie Tarara is she was a researcher

1040
00:40:09,429 --> 00:40:15,460
out of Washington State and then with

1041
00:40:10,690 --> 00:40:20,679
USDA did develop a strain gauge on for

1042
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:22,300
the wire and so so the answer is yes and

1043
00:40:20,679 --> 00:40:24,429
she there's some published work on that

1044
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:34,900
I don't have Justine you have anything

1045
00:40:24,429 --> 00:40:36,759
to add to it just so-so

1046
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:38,530
so again like with a lot of our sensors

1047
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:40,270
you have the strange gate strain gauge

1048
00:40:38,530 --> 00:40:41,890
on there and there's a lot of noise and

1049
00:40:40,269 --> 00:40:44,079
then you use a software that kind of

1050
00:40:41,889 --> 00:40:46,960
eliminate that noise and then throughout

1051
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:48,489
a season you can feel how that you know

1052
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:51,460
oh there's more tension on that wire and

1053
00:40:48,489 --> 00:40:52,929
less and you have to separate out how

1054
00:40:51,460 --> 00:41:12,579
much of that weight is canopy and how

1055
00:40:52,929 --> 00:41:14,440
much of it is cropped yes so that that's

1056
00:41:12,579 --> 00:41:19,029
all part of our kind of our crop load

1057
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:22,690
decision so we've been doing destructive

1058
00:41:19,030 --> 00:41:25,540
crop estimation work for 20 years now so

1059
00:41:22,690 --> 00:41:27,610
the way we do it is is a grower will

1060
00:41:25,539 --> 00:41:30,519
actually take a rope that's 1% of an

1061
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:32,380
acre so forty eight point six feet lay

1062
00:41:30,519 --> 00:41:35,590
that out in the vineyard and clean pick

1063
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:40,269
that 1% and weigh the fruit and based on

1064
00:41:35,590 --> 00:41:42,280
the berry curve 30 roughly 30 days after

1065
00:41:40,269 --> 00:41:43,900
bloom is 50% of final weight so at 30

1066
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:45,220
days after bloom they they pick four

1067
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:48,420
tons per acre they know they're gonna

1068
00:41:45,219 --> 00:41:51,939
have eight tons per acre at harvest

1069
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:55,659
based on weather conditions so

1070
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:57,818
especially the timing of bloom we kind

1071
00:41:55,659 --> 00:42:00,009
have rules of thumb that we go by it's

1072
00:41:57,818 --> 00:42:02,440
like for every three days is equal to a

1073
00:42:00,010 --> 00:42:04,630
ton if I'm three days early I'm bloom

1074
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:06,519
that's an extra ton I can if I'm a week

1075
00:42:04,630 --> 00:42:08,140
late on bloom that's two tons I probably

1076
00:42:06,519 --> 00:42:12,608
can't write them that I would normally

1077
00:42:08,139 --> 00:42:16,088
write then as far as long-term data sets

1078
00:42:12,608 --> 00:42:18,068
so we have phonology dates right same

1079
00:42:16,088 --> 00:42:22,119
set of vines that we've collect bud

1080
00:42:18,068 --> 00:42:25,690
break bloom ver Asian harvest dates on

1081
00:42:22,119 --> 00:42:28,269
and we do see a trend you know over the

1082
00:42:25,690 --> 00:42:31,088
last 50 years a trend towards earlier

1083
00:42:28,269 --> 00:42:32,949
bud break earlier bloom and that should

1084
00:42:31,088 --> 00:42:37,538
translate into more fruit that we can

1085
00:42:32,949 --> 00:42:41,048
ripen it Falls also seem to be getting

1086
00:42:37,539 --> 00:42:43,720
wetter so we've had a lot of rain just

1087
00:42:41,048 --> 00:42:45,699
in the last couple weeks and that'll

1088
00:42:43,719 --> 00:42:48,669
hurt us in terms of trying to ripen that

1089
00:42:45,699 --> 00:43:12,818
fruit as well so I don't know if I

1090
00:42:48,670 --> 00:43:15,548
answered your question okay yes and no

1091
00:43:12,818 --> 00:43:17,048
so yes we started to use lidar very

1092
00:43:15,548 --> 00:43:19,239
early in the project and it was more

1093
00:43:17,048 --> 00:43:23,318
towards canopy structure not much with

1094
00:43:19,239 --> 00:43:24,969
with berry weight and yes I agree with

1095
00:43:23,318 --> 00:43:27,460
you there are other sensors out there

1096
00:43:24,969 --> 00:43:29,139
that I think could help us Carnegie

1097
00:43:27,460 --> 00:43:34,420
Mellon is really focused on their image

1098
00:43:29,139 --> 00:43:36,960
sensor they can get answers yes but

1099
00:43:34,420 --> 00:43:36,960
we're not using

1100
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:25,360
so yeah so if you go back to 1960

1101
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:28,600
there'll be a curve on pruning wait and

1102
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:31,240
yield and it does the same thing so as

1103
00:44:28,599 --> 00:44:33,400
the vine gets bigger within its defined

1104
00:44:31,239 --> 00:44:37,419
space as a vine gets bigger it produces

1105
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:40,269
more leaf area and then then it if 100%

1106
00:44:37,420 --> 00:44:42,159
fills that canopy space and by making

1107
00:44:40,269 --> 00:44:43,719
the vine even bigger or more vegetative

1108
00:44:42,159 --> 00:44:46,389
all you're doing is packing it with more

1109
00:44:43,719 --> 00:44:47,739
leaves but you're those leaves aren't

1110
00:44:46,389 --> 00:44:50,109
productive because they're tucked up

1111
00:44:47,739 --> 00:44:52,809
into the shade so we see the same curve

1112
00:44:50,110 --> 00:44:54,760
we see that with our NDVI because it is

1113
00:44:52,809 --> 00:44:57,549
the sensor is pointing at the canopy on

1114
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:59,190
the outside and you're getting you know

1115
00:44:57,550 --> 00:45:01,360
when the canopy is not filled it's

1116
00:44:59,190 --> 00:45:04,570
increasing by the time that canopy is

1117
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:07,090
filled it it saturates that sensor so

1118
00:45:04,570 --> 00:45:11,050
that curve flattens off

1119
00:45:07,090 --> 00:45:14,350
I think that's translatable to other

1120
00:45:11,050 --> 00:45:19,240
vineyards then I still say the number

1121
00:45:14,349 --> 00:45:20,469
one problem in our industry is lack of

1122
00:45:19,239 --> 00:45:22,689
vine size right

1123
00:45:20,469 --> 00:45:24,549
we almost I would say almost all of our

1124
00:45:22,690 --> 00:45:27,970
vineyards are dealing with the 1 to 3

1125
00:45:24,550 --> 00:45:30,039
pound by not the 3 to 5 pound by if you

1126
00:45:27,969 --> 00:45:32,379
go to a winery that's on a very vigorous

1127
00:45:30,039 --> 00:45:34,360
root stock and Justine knows very well

1128
00:45:32,380 --> 00:45:36,280
by stuff does a lot of her work is on

1129
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:38,140
decrease in figure so there are a lot of

1130
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:39,820
wineries that are dealing in the three

1131
00:45:38,139 --> 00:45:43,349
to five pound vines and they're actually

1132
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:43,350
trying to bring the vine size down

1133
00:45:43,708 --> 00:45:48,129
so I think the way to answer your

1134
00:45:45,548 --> 00:45:50,228
question is if you're below 100 percent

1135
00:45:48,130 --> 00:45:52,449
canopy Phil I think NDVI is very good I

1136
00:45:50,228 --> 00:45:54,968
think if you're above 100 percent canopy

1137
00:45:52,449 --> 00:45:58,239
Phil I don't think NDVI is very good and

1138
00:45:54,969 --> 00:46:01,019
you need other technology whatever that

1139
00:45:58,239 --> 00:46:09,719
is to measure canopy density would be

1140
00:46:01,018 --> 00:46:20,858
good one question about finding that is

1141
00:46:09,719 --> 00:46:23,829
so plants generally do numbers or even

1142
00:46:20,858 --> 00:46:29,440
after it begins to grow if the

1143
00:46:23,829 --> 00:46:33,209
conditions of the environment it's not

1144
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:33,208
adequate fans do now

1145
00:46:33,539 --> 00:46:42,789
and yet it seems that in your dreams

1146
00:46:37,059 --> 00:46:44,528
they tend to be very liberal of for to

1147
00:46:42,789 --> 00:46:47,160
maintain and you're making the

1148
00:46:44,528 --> 00:46:49,719
adjustment finding constants and that

1149
00:46:47,159 --> 00:46:54,190
contrast a lot with my experience in

1150
00:46:49,719 --> 00:46:56,829
Maine where generally what we found is

1151
00:46:54,190 --> 00:46:57,458
that the germplasm the phenotypes that

1152
00:46:56,829 --> 00:47:00,519
are out there

1153
00:46:57,458 --> 00:47:02,288
dignity too conservative relative to

1154
00:47:00,518 --> 00:47:05,198
what borrowers would like and through

1155
00:47:02,289 --> 00:47:08,199
reading and trying to get the plants to

1156
00:47:05,199 --> 00:47:10,509
not afford to become barren lands under

1157
00:47:08,199 --> 00:47:12,459
stress conditions so can you make a

1158
00:47:10,509 --> 00:47:17,909
comment on what is it that's different

1159
00:47:12,458 --> 00:47:21,368
about grapes no it's not that different

1160
00:47:17,909 --> 00:47:24,489
we do measure the yield components and

1161
00:47:21,369 --> 00:47:25,869
as we increase bud number we will

1162
00:47:24,489 --> 00:47:27,940
increase yield but that there's a

1163
00:47:25,869 --> 00:47:30,190
diminishing return on that right as you

1164
00:47:27,940 --> 00:47:34,280
increase by number the yield goes up but

1165
00:47:30,190 --> 00:47:35,960
the you know

1166
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:37,730
per shoot we'll go average clusters per

1167
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:39,110
shoot will go down average berries per

1168
00:47:37,730 --> 00:47:40,880
cluster will go down average berry

1169
00:47:39,110 --> 00:47:42,740
weight will go down and we actually put

1170
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:45,559
all that stuff into our into our crop

1171
00:47:42,739 --> 00:47:47,929
load model account for that but really

1172
00:47:45,559 --> 00:47:51,949
the bottom line for us is that we can

1173
00:47:47,929 --> 00:47:54,739
over crop of I like the the reduction in

1174
00:47:51,949 --> 00:47:57,019
yield components isn't as great as you

1175
00:47:54,739 --> 00:47:58,819
can make it so I can leave a hundred and

1176
00:47:57,019 --> 00:48:00,619
fifty buds on a Concord vine on a eight

1177
00:47:58,820 --> 00:48:03,200
foot spacing and it could potentially

1178
00:48:00,619 --> 00:48:06,019
produce 12 to 15 tons breaker which we

1179
00:48:03,199 --> 00:48:08,199
will never get ripe if I left it there

1180
00:48:06,019 --> 00:48:11,179
vine size will end up going down because

1181
00:48:08,199 --> 00:48:15,289
because of carbohydrate balance so about

1182
00:48:11,179 --> 00:48:16,699
midseason to the till final harvest so

1183
00:48:15,289 --> 00:48:18,590
we've done studies looking at starch

1184
00:48:16,699 --> 00:48:20,480
accumulation and perennial structures if

1185
00:48:18,590 --> 00:48:22,850
you are have the vine that is over crop

1186
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:24,409
the starch starch is going into the wood

1187
00:48:22,849 --> 00:48:25,880
sugar is going into the fruit late in

1188
00:48:24,409 --> 00:48:27,980
the season and and that there's a

1189
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:29,630
balance there too much crop you're gonna

1190
00:48:27,980 --> 00:48:32,150
get less starch into the wood so less

1191
00:48:29,630 --> 00:48:34,010
root growth less vine size less pruning

1192
00:48:32,150 --> 00:48:36,079
weight less productivity for the next

1193
00:48:34,010 --> 00:48:38,240
season so what we tend to see is you

1194
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:40,549
over crop a vine cause you forced it by

1195
00:48:38,239 --> 00:48:42,619
leaving too many buds you drive vine

1196
00:48:40,550 --> 00:48:45,530
size down and your production goes down

1197
00:48:42,619 --> 00:48:47,569
over years actually when I started

1198
00:48:45,530 --> 00:48:50,330
working at Cornell there was a big issue

1199
00:48:47,570 --> 00:48:53,420
called Miller and Dodge and they we all

1200
00:48:50,329 --> 00:48:56,599
I think we finally came up that it was a

1201
00:48:53,420 --> 00:48:58,519
carbohydrate issue is so growers started

1202
00:48:56,599 --> 00:49:00,909
going to minimal pruning which was they

1203
00:48:58,519 --> 00:49:03,650
just skirted devine so you suddenly left

1204
00:49:00,909 --> 00:49:06,529
you may have a vine that you prune to

1205
00:49:03,650 --> 00:49:08,420
sixty buds for twenty years so you you

1206
00:49:06,530 --> 00:49:11,330
kind of kind of kept the crop load down

1207
00:49:08,420 --> 00:49:13,280
they were balanced so there were strong

1208
00:49:11,329 --> 00:49:16,190
vines and then all of a sudden you left

1209
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:17,570
400 buds by just hardly pruning at all

1210
00:49:16,190 --> 00:49:20,960
and it was a system that came out of

1211
00:49:17,570 --> 00:49:23,120
Australia so all of a sudden you had 13

1212
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:24,740
tons per acre 13 tonnes per acre and

1213
00:49:23,119 --> 00:49:26,239
then the next year came back with two

1214
00:49:24,739 --> 00:49:29,359
tons per acre and then bounced back up

1215
00:49:26,239 --> 00:49:31,039
to 15 tons per acre and the years that I

1216
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:32,890
had two tons per acre all the clusters

1217
00:49:31,039 --> 00:49:36,650
were there but the fruit never developed

1218
00:49:32,889 --> 00:49:38,719
so it's it's similar it's just the way

1219
00:49:36,650 --> 00:49:40,070
we attack it now as we try to try to

1220
00:49:38,719 --> 00:49:41,809
bounce it leave a little bit more crop

1221
00:49:40,070 --> 00:49:44,019
that we need and adjust down as

1222
00:49:41,809 --> 00:49:44,019
necessary

1223
00:49:45,579 --> 00:49:50,059
that's very good questions regarding

1224
00:49:48,380 --> 00:49:52,820
thinning the roots

1225
00:49:50,059 --> 00:50:00,469
it's the are these range the very center

1226
00:49:52,820 --> 00:50:03,289
whether the damage of a problem if you

1227
00:50:00,469 --> 00:50:05,179
do it right no again we've been doing

1228
00:50:03,289 --> 00:50:06,889
this as for as long as I've been here it

1229
00:50:05,179 --> 00:50:10,299
was was a system that was started with

1230
00:50:06,889 --> 00:50:13,039
Bob pool before before I came on board

1231
00:50:10,300 --> 00:50:17,180
and yes you will talk to growers and

1232
00:50:13,039 --> 00:50:19,579
there have been horror stories so the

1233
00:50:17,179 --> 00:50:20,929
harvesters we used to use they have rods

1234
00:50:19,579 --> 00:50:22,909
in them and they used to have straight

1235
00:50:20,929 --> 00:50:24,739
rods and they used to hit the vines like

1236
00:50:22,909 --> 00:50:27,109
this and there's on a whip action at the

1237
00:50:24,739 --> 00:50:29,349
end and there was a lot of broken shoots

1238
00:50:27,110 --> 00:50:31,430
a lot of damaged berries and people said

1239
00:50:29,349 --> 00:50:31,849
thinning mechanical thinning is never

1240
00:50:31,429 --> 00:50:34,190
gonna work

1241
00:50:31,849 --> 00:50:36,019
and into this day I have old growers

1242
00:50:34,190 --> 00:50:37,280
like you're killing my vines never do

1243
00:50:36,019 --> 00:50:40,009
that again

1244
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:42,620
but now the harvesters we can tighten up

1245
00:50:40,010 --> 00:50:44,600
where the bow rods are they're not

1246
00:50:42,619 --> 00:50:46,670
street rods anymore they're bow rod so

1247
00:50:44,599 --> 00:50:49,519
there's no whip action and now were

1248
00:50:46,670 --> 00:50:51,889
there in sync so so we actually grip the

1249
00:50:49,519 --> 00:50:54,500
vine and we just shake it a little and

1250
00:50:51,889 --> 00:50:57,259
again there's a variety issue thing here

1251
00:50:54,500 --> 00:50:58,670
Concord at the end of the season we'll

1252
00:50:57,260 --> 00:50:59,810
have three grand berries middle of

1253
00:50:58,670 --> 00:51:02,960
season winter thinning they're about

1254
00:50:59,809 --> 00:51:04,789
one-and-a-half cranberries most vanilla

1255
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:06,559
especially like Riesling that's a tight

1256
00:51:04,789 --> 00:51:08,300
cluster variety at the end of the season

1257
00:51:06,559 --> 00:51:10,909
will be one point five gram so the

1258
00:51:08,300 --> 00:51:12,560
berries are much smaller so again kind

1259
00:51:10,909 --> 00:51:14,690
of cord loose clusters big berries

1260
00:51:12,559 --> 00:51:18,199
middle of season it actually works

1261
00:51:14,690 --> 00:51:20,200
fairly well for us that we have trouble

1262
00:51:18,199 --> 00:51:22,489
with tight cluster different varieties

1263
00:51:20,199 --> 00:51:24,019
there are other machines out there that

1264
00:51:22,489 --> 00:51:26,049
are trying to do it but yes we get a lot

1265
00:51:24,019 --> 00:51:26,050
of

1266
00:51:31,670 --> 00:51:36,990
