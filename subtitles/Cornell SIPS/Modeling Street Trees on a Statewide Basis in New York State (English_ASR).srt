1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:04,960
this is a production of cornell

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:04,960
university

3
00:00:07,599 --> 00:00:11,599
the title of my talk is modeling street

4
00:00:09,439 --> 00:00:13,839
trees on a statewide basis in new york

5
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:15,919
state but essentially what i'm doing is

6
00:00:13,839 --> 00:00:17,679
it's a state of the state of street

7
00:00:15,919 --> 00:00:21,600
trees in new york state it's a statewide

8
00:00:17,679 --> 00:00:21,600
assessment of street trees

9
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:27,599
and just to define what a street tree is

10
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,039
it's a tree growing in the public right

11
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:30,240
of way

12
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:32,079
for the benefit of the community that's

13
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:35,039
how i'm defining it and public right of

14
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:36,960
way typically is

15
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:40,558
most often is a tree lawn like this

16
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,558
between the sidewalk and the street

17
00:00:43,119 --> 00:00:46,878
now when you say for the benefit of the

18
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:48,878
public that isn't typically that wasn't

19
00:00:46,878 --> 00:00:50,399
originally what street trees were about

20
00:00:48,878 --> 00:00:51,679
they were basically for the amusement

21
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,079
and pleasure

22
00:00:51,679 --> 00:00:56,000
of the noble classes uh

23
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:59,039
in paris that's where

24
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,399
but the american model is is far more

25
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:02,879
democratic

26
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:04,320
at least in theory and they're just you

27
00:01:02,878 --> 00:01:06,239
know it's something you you see

28
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:07,919
everywhere it's a it's a fixture in

29
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:10,000
everyday life

30
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,079
although when we don't see them we go

31
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,640
gee uh what's wrong with this

32
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:15,920
neighborhood in lima as compared to this

33
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,118
and

34
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:21,920
uh we associate street trees

35
00:01:19,118 --> 00:01:23,599
in many ways with with us the aesthetics

36
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,159
of the community the identity of the

37
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:26,158
community

38
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:31,279
but increasingly

39
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:34,240
what we're what we'd like to think about

40
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:35,840
is the benefits and ecosystem services

41
00:01:34,239 --> 00:01:36,959
associated with street trees which is

42
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,960
something

43
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:40,478
i'm very concerned with not only in my

44
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:42,640
work here but with my work for

45
00:01:40,478 --> 00:01:44,640
sustainable sites initiative

46
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:47,200
in austin texas

47
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:49,118
and so ecosystem services can include

48
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,200
storm water reduction air quality

49
00:01:49,118 --> 00:01:52,478
improvement energy conservation and so

50
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,840
on

51
00:01:52,478 --> 00:01:55,840
and they're basically

52
00:01:56,239 --> 00:02:00,158
proportional to the amount of leaf

53
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,920
surface area

54
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:04,240
associated with the tree so here you can

55
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:06,000
see droplets of precipitation

56
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:08,799
intercepted by

57
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,120
by this leaf

58
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,560
now the forest service has gotten very

59
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,120
interested

60
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,800
in

61
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:18,879
conceptualizing thinking about large

62
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:22,640
large landscape scale

63
00:02:18,878 --> 00:02:23,679
urban forestry and canopy cover and

64
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:26,159
they've done

65
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:28,719
invest a lot of time and money in in

66
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:31,120
canopy cover assessments for

67
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:33,359
at this landscape scale

68
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:35,120
and what they're

69
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,760
asked they ask two questions basically

70
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,640
how much tree canopy do i have

71
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:40,719
and

72
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:43,039
associate with that how many ecosystem

73
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:44,959
benefits do i have associated with that

74
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:46,799
and how much tree canopy could i have

75
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:48,560
how many planting spaces in a way are

76
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,319
available

77
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:53,039
which is good i mean this is a very

78
00:02:50,318 --> 00:02:53,919
useful way to look at

79
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:55,280
what

80
00:02:53,919 --> 00:02:57,280
exists

81
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:59,919
and what you could have but it doesn't

82
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:02,479
answer a fundamental question at a much

83
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:04,799
more discreet scale which is what tree

84
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:06,560
species should i plant

85
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,519
remote sensing hyper

86
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,080
hypo

87
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:12,158
spectral remote sensing is not all that

88
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:14,000
reliable in terms of identifying trees

89
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:16,959
species

90
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,878
so it also doesn't answer a larger

91
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:21,120
question

92
00:03:18,878 --> 00:03:23,120
such as how many

93
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,800
ash trees are vulnerable to the emerald

94
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,719
ash borer as you know

95
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:30,080
the emerald ash borer is an invasive

96
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:31,598
pest species that is killing ash trees

97
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,959
and there's also the asian longhorn

98
00:03:31,598 --> 00:03:34,079
beetle

99
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:36,959
which

100
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:40,000
is killing maple trees so these are

101
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:42,158
issues at a larger than local scale a

102
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,318
statewide scale that

103
00:03:42,158 --> 00:03:45,919
are of concern to people like the new

104
00:03:44,318 --> 00:03:47,439
york state department of environmental

105
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:48,639
conservation

106
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:50,639
and

107
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:52,158
the work i've done is really targeted

108
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:54,719
towards answering these types of

109
00:03:52,158 --> 00:03:54,719
questions

110
00:03:55,759 --> 00:04:00,959
now when i say scale

111
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:03,120
or level um you know we typically

112
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:05,039
collect data at

113
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,878
a very discreet scale and then we

114
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:08,878
aggregate it to the scale of the village

115
00:04:06,878 --> 00:04:10,798
for instance write a report

116
00:04:08,878 --> 00:04:13,039
but there are other

117
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:15,438
wider larger scales as well and you know

118
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:17,039
new york state is really what i'm

119
00:04:15,438 --> 00:04:19,680
basically doing

120
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:21,759
is extrapolating from this scale of the

121
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,918
village or the municipality

122
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:25,600
to that of the state and as you can see

123
00:04:23,918 --> 00:04:27,839
when you start extrapolating when you

124
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,759
start getting into a larger scale you

125
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:31,839
sort of lose a lot of your resolution

126
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:34,720
you lose some of the detail

127
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:37,599
associated with that data

128
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:39,280
it's a trade-off

129
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,360
so my goals

130
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:43,039
in in conducting this assessment and

131
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,240
basically i was i was working with the

132
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:46,000
dec

133
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,759
and this is some of these uh are

134
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
stipulated by them

135
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:52,080
but basically i wanted to identify the

136
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,720
prevalent the most common street tree

137
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:57,039
species in general in new york state i

138
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,880
wanted to estimate the the numbers

139
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,000
for those prevalent street tree species

140
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:01,759
in general

141
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,680
and i want to estimate the annual

142
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:05,520
benefits provided by street trees as

143
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:08,639
calculated by the

144
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:10,639
u.s forest service has a program called

145
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:12,478
a program called i tree

146
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:15,360
and some people love it some people

147
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:17,519
don't the dec asked me to do it using

148
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,038
that program so that's what i did but it

149
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:22,319
quantifies

150
00:05:19,038 --> 00:05:24,639
in monetary terms uh ecosystem and other

151
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:26,079
benefits such as energy conservation

152
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:30,079
property

153
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:32,240
value and stormwater reduction

154
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:36,000
and to do all these three

155
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:38,079
goals i was i wanted to use methods

156
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
they were easily replicable by other

157
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:41,519
states because the issues that are faced

158
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,120
by new york state are faced by other

159
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:45,519
states as well

160
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:48,079
and the idea is that whatever is done

161
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:51,478
here could be could be exported to those

162
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:51,478
states potentially

163
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:55,758
how is this assessment different well i

164
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:56,719
should say that

165
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:58,560
these

166
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:01,120
the idea of a statewide assessment has

167
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,918
been has been contemplated elsewhere as

168
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,600
well

169
00:06:01,918 --> 00:06:05,839
um

170
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:08,000
california has periodically sent

171
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:10,959
questionnaires out to urban foresters

172
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,560
and gotten feedback from them

173
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:14,159
washington state would like to do

174
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:16,879
something like this but they cut the

175
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:18,880
funding for it so they didn't do it

176
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:22,079
there are some some studies as well as

177
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:24,319
indiana and south dakota however what

178
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:26,639
they don't do is they don't

179
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:29,840
basically construct a statistically

180
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:31,680
valid model and that model is not

181
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:34,318
and their data isn't necessarily based

182
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:37,199
on street tree inventory data and they

183
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:38,639
don't identify incorporate geographical

184
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:41,120
geographical

185
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:43,199
differences into their analysis and they

186
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:46,840
certainly don't use gis in their

187
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:48,478
analysis and statistical estimates

188
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:50,399
now

189
00:06:48,478 --> 00:06:53,599
essentially what i had to work with and

190
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:56,719
had to collect was data from

191
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:58,160
these municipalities i got data from 138

192
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,160
municipalities

193
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,919
i subdivided in new york city where you

194
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,280
have five boroughs in each rosa county

195
00:07:01,918 --> 00:07:05,519
into into its

196
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:08,159
into its different boroughs so i had 142

197
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:08,159
data sets

198
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,399
the data that we collect that is

199
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,478
collected in street street tree

200
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:16,719
inventories is

201
00:07:14,478 --> 00:07:19,199
species diameter

202
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:22,160
which is a proxy for the age of the tree

203
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:25,280
true diameter and also it's very

204
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:26,960
important is the planting look site type

205
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:29,439
whether it's in a tree lawn or a front

206
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:31,439
yard or a sidewalk pit or whether you

207
00:07:29,439 --> 00:07:34,079
have utility wires

208
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:34,079
overhead

209
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,960
the other side of this equation is that

210
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:42,239
most communities in new york state don't

211
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:42,239
have street tree inventories

212
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:48,000
and another issue which is actually as

213
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:49,919
important is the fact that the data that

214
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
is collected is typically

215
00:07:49,918 --> 00:07:54,719
all over the place it's not necessarily

216
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,879
standardized i mean i have maybe six or

217
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:59,680
seven different types of tree diameter

218
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:02,160
type data and the trick is to put it

219
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:04,240
together to aggregate it as as

220
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:07,039
as well as i can which isn't always

221
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:08,319
possible but uh and also not everybody

222
00:08:07,038 --> 00:08:10,159
collects

223
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:12,879
tree genus a tree species they'll

224
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:14,400
collect genus but not species

225
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:16,479
so

226
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:17,679
it's a bit of a we call it a mess but

227
00:08:16,478 --> 00:08:19,598
there's certainly some challenges

228
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,800
involved in the data

229
00:08:19,598 --> 00:08:23,439
now

230
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,879
one thing that was hypothesized early on

231
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:27,279
and which

232
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:28,560
proved accurate was that

233
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:29,839
um

234
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:33,120
the data

235
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:34,718
the the the uh united states usda

236
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,879
planned hardened zones of which they're

237
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:38,879
actually five i aggregated

238
00:08:36,879 --> 00:08:41,278
uh number three and number four because

239
00:08:38,879 --> 00:08:42,719
in the adirondacks they're not that many

240
00:08:41,278 --> 00:08:45,278
uh

241
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:48,560
populated communities but

242
00:08:45,278 --> 00:08:50,958
that these zones were have the most

243
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:53,599
explanatory power of any variable i

244
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:55,119
found and you know just getting into a

245
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:58,159
discussion of

246
00:08:55,120 --> 00:09:00,480
of of of these planned hardness zones is

247
00:08:58,159 --> 00:09:02,159
is another topic unto itself and

248
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:05,519
supposedly they've been they're going to

249
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:08,399
be updated next year and if they do then

250
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:10,720
this will all have to be

251
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:13,600
redone which is fine but that's what i

252
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,959
went with the 1990 zones

253
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:18,159
and

254
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:19,919
in gis i aggregated my data into those

255
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:21,439
respective zones

256
00:09:19,919 --> 00:09:23,278
and what

257
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:27,279
you'll see as i go through what i did is

258
00:09:23,278 --> 00:09:27,278
that means for variables of interest

259
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:31,278
now these basically

260
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:33,600
so if i want to know these were the

261
00:09:31,278 --> 00:09:35,600
constructs i used to sort of go to to

262
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:37,278
construct my analysis

263
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,360
and if i want to know the total number

264
00:09:37,278 --> 00:09:41,519
of street trees per species or genus or

265
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:44,080
the total benefits for all street trees

266
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:45,679
i first have to know how many

267
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:49,040
or i have to estimate how many street

268
00:09:45,679 --> 00:09:49,039
trees there are in new york state

269
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,399
which is a bit of a problem

270
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,240
um

271
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:56,320
but

272
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,759
to figure that out to ed to create an

273
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,278
estimate for that

274
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:00,639
i said well

275
00:09:59,278 --> 00:10:02,399
the number of street trees is going to

276
00:10:00,639 --> 00:10:04,159
be a function of street length and

277
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:05,839
populated places now what i mean by

278
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:08,559
populated places

279
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:11,519
populated places would be census places

280
00:10:08,559 --> 00:10:14,479
such as villages and cities

281
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:16,399
but it's also census blocks with a

282
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:19,759
persons per square mile of greater than

283
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:24,879
500 people which is the census

284
00:10:19,759 --> 00:10:24,879
threshold for suburban versus rural

285
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,600
and

286
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:33,360
i said well these are streets that we

287
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:34,879
can expect to to contain street trees

288
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,959
so then i had to figure out the length

289
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:38,958
of such streets

290
00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:40,479
and just to give you an idea what we're

291
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:42,159
looking at is we're not looking for

292
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:44,320
street trees on interstates we're not

293
00:10:42,159 --> 00:10:45,838
looking for them in driveways

294
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,278
we're looking for them in residential

295
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:51,360
areas we're looking for them in in

296
00:10:47,278 --> 00:10:51,360
commercial areas such as those

297
00:10:52,078 --> 00:10:55,838
and we can do this in gis we can

298
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,159
differentiate between

299
00:10:55,839 --> 00:11:00,079
between types of streets

300
00:10:58,159 --> 00:11:02,799
and for instance here we have the

301
00:11:00,078 --> 00:11:05,359
outline for the city of syracuse

302
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:07,519
and we have in pink

303
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:10,079
well i would what i'm terming streets

304
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:13,200
expected to contain street trees as

305
00:11:10,078 --> 00:11:16,319
opposed to interstates and driveways and

306
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:17,920
and roads going through shopping malls

307
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:21,278
and things like that which are mapped

308
00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:21,278
but we don't want to include

309
00:11:21,759 --> 00:11:24,720
now

310
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:25,519
it's also important to note that you

311
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,600
know

312
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:30,159
we have villages outside here we have

313
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:32,639
census blocks with greater than 500

314
00:11:30,159 --> 00:11:34,559
people so those are also included in the

315
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:35,919
analysis we i did this for all of new

316
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:37,439
york state

317
00:11:35,919 --> 00:11:38,719
and when you do that for all of new york

318
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:41,120
state

319
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:43,120
you basically find

320
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,480
so here we have

321
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,320
these are not all the streets in new

322
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:48,959
york state these are the streets that

323
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:52,079
i've differentiated in gis

324
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:54,799
and each street has a length associated

325
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:57,759
with it which you can sum the length of

326
00:11:54,799 --> 00:11:59,599
and so i came up with a measure for all

327
00:11:57,759 --> 00:12:01,838
this all of these streets expected to

328
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:06,000
contain street trees in new york state

329
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:09,839
of approximately 83 million meters

330
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:12,480
which is an estimate it's not exact

331
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:14,720
and then i aggregated that data

332
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:17,839
those streets to their respective plant

333
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,839
hardiness zones

334
00:12:18,078 --> 00:12:24,319
so i have four zones with a sum of

335
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:27,360
street length in each zone

336
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:30,160
the reason this is important is because

337
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:32,800
the further south you go

338
00:12:30,159 --> 00:12:35,360
let's say if you go from you you find an

339
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:37,439
increasing number of streets in

340
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:40,959
populated areas

341
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:42,639
so that's important because i used the

342
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:44,958
relative

343
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:48,560
length summed length of streets in new

344
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:52,319
york state by by zone to create weights

345
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:53,759
for for most of my subsequent measures

346
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,760
so in other words

347
00:12:53,759 --> 00:12:57,919
when you get to westchester and new york

348
00:12:55,759 --> 00:13:00,319
city and in suffolk and nassau counties

349
00:12:57,919 --> 00:13:02,799
you have more street length associated

350
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:07,839
with populated places than for instance

351
00:13:02,799 --> 00:13:07,838
you would um up in the north country

352
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,320
so

353
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:13,838
here's what here was my original

354
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:16,399
construct

355
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:18,160
and if i plug in my meters for new york

356
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:19,839
state

357
00:13:18,159 --> 00:13:22,078
then i have to figure out what is my

358
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:24,000
number of street trees per unit street

359
00:13:22,078 --> 00:13:26,078
length which is

360
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:30,879
the next thing i worked on

361
00:13:26,078 --> 00:13:32,958
now as i said i have 142 data sets

362
00:13:30,879 --> 00:13:35,200
and basically

363
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:37,119
did the same thing for all those and

364
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:39,680
basically here's the boundary of of a

365
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,639
village lima new york in livingston

366
00:13:39,679 --> 00:13:41,359
county

367
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:43,039
and

368
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:44,879
because there's an inventory i know how

369
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:47,039
many street trees there are i know what

370
00:13:44,879 --> 00:13:49,838
the length of the road is

371
00:13:47,039 --> 00:13:52,240
in lima and i can calculate a measure

372
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:54,000
for street trees per meter or street

373
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:57,198
trees per mile

374
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,078
what's interesting is that

375
00:13:57,198 --> 00:14:01,198
this

376
00:13:58,078 --> 00:14:04,319
the mean the group mean for

377
00:14:01,198 --> 00:14:07,278
this measure for four zones varies

378
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:09,278
so it's not it's statistically different

379
00:14:07,278 --> 00:14:12,559
depending upon the zone

380
00:14:09,278 --> 00:14:15,278
so for instance in zone seven

381
00:14:12,559 --> 00:14:17,439
you have a greater number of street

382
00:14:15,278 --> 00:14:19,198
trees per mile than you do

383
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:22,560
in lyman

384
00:14:19,198 --> 00:14:22,559
which i believe is zone six

385
00:14:23,679 --> 00:14:28,638
so statewide you weight the group mean i

386
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:31,519
come up with a weighted statewide mean

387
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:34,680
for this measure and it this weighted

388
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:37,120
statewide mean for this measure is

389
00:14:34,679 --> 00:14:40,319
0.500 and it goes on and on and on

390
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:43,278
street trees per meter

391
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:45,760
so i take that measure

392
00:14:43,278 --> 00:14:48,559
and i plug it back into my my little

393
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:52,000
construct here and i come up with

394
00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:54,719
a a number an estimate of over four

395
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:57,039
million street trees in new york state

396
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:59,040
now there's also a standard error of the

397
00:14:57,039 --> 00:15:02,399
weighted statewide mean associated with

398
00:14:59,039 --> 00:15:04,719
this so i can create a 90 percent

399
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:06,639
confidence interval

400
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:08,000
for how many trees or likely street

401
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:09,120
trees are likely to be throughout new

402
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,399
york state

403
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:12,480
so that that's

404
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:14,559
i've gotten this far

405
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:16,480
and so i'll okay back to figuring out

406
00:15:14,559 --> 00:15:18,399
the mean percentage of street trees or

407
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:21,519
species

408
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:22,879
that's what i have to figure out next

409
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:24,959
now for each

410
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:26,958
inventory where i can do this this is

411
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:29,039
what a typical inventory looks like we

412
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:31,198
have the number of trees we have the

413
00:15:29,039 --> 00:15:32,879
percentage of a particular genus in this

414
00:15:31,198 --> 00:15:34,719
case

415
00:15:32,879 --> 00:15:36,399
maple is

416
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:38,000
heavily represented which is not unusual

417
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:40,078
in new york state

418
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,639
basically i take each inventory

419
00:15:40,078 --> 00:15:44,559
percentage i create a mean inventory

420
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:46,959
percentage by zone

421
00:15:44,559 --> 00:15:48,719
and then i take my weights that you saw

422
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:50,879
before and i wait

423
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:53,519
i weight that to create a weighted

424
00:15:50,879 --> 00:15:57,360
statewide percentage

425
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:57,360
for each generating species

426
00:15:57,679 --> 00:16:02,319
and if we look at

427
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:04,720
these are the five most prevalent street

428
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:06,240
tree genera in new york state

429
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:09,920
and

430
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:11,680
it's interesting that they seem in most

431
00:16:09,919 --> 00:16:13,599
cases they vary

432
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:16,078
geographically we can see for instance

433
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:17,278
that acer maple

434
00:16:16,078 --> 00:16:20,958
is much more

435
00:16:17,278 --> 00:16:23,519
is less prevalent down uh in zone seven

436
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:25,039
which is westchester suffolk nassau

437
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:27,120
county in new york city

438
00:16:25,039 --> 00:16:28,480
conversely we see

439
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:31,039
more

440
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:34,399
prevalent plantings of

441
00:16:31,039 --> 00:16:35,599
quercus which is oak plain tree

442
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:37,600
papyrus

443
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:40,240
whereas gleditsia is pretty evenly

444
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,240
distributed

445
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:44,880
similar

446
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:46,399
street tree species

447
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:49,600
you know this is kind of interesting how

448
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:51,278
norway maple spikes way up here but

449
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:53,120
and it's also interesting to note that

450
00:16:51,278 --> 00:16:56,720
the foremost four of the five most

451
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:59,519
prevalent species happen to be maple

452
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:02,079
but again we can see you know sort of

453
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:04,880
different geographic difference

454
00:17:02,078 --> 00:17:07,119
in prevalence

455
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,120
so

456
00:17:07,279 --> 00:17:11,038
i go through all the data i construct

457
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:12,880
these i come up with these mean

458
00:17:11,038 --> 00:17:13,679
statewide means for

459
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,400
for

460
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:19,120
each species i have confidence intervals

461
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:22,000
uh 90 confidence intervals they do the

462
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:24,879
same thing for for for genera i do it

463
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,880
for species

464
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:29,279
in this case acer platinoids nori maple

465
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:32,159
is the most prevalent

466
00:17:29,279 --> 00:17:33,839
street tree species in new york state

467
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:35,919
and

468
00:17:33,839 --> 00:17:37,759
i frequently not frequently but i often

469
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:39,600
get asked how many ash trees are in new

470
00:17:37,759 --> 00:17:41,759
york state because communities

471
00:17:39,599 --> 00:17:43,439
the state wants to get an idea of how

472
00:17:41,759 --> 00:17:46,480
many ash trees are potentially

473
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:48,640
vulnerable to the emerald ash borer

474
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:50,640
and if we take the number of estimated

475
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:52,000
number of street trees and the statewide

476
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:54,160
weighted mean

477
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,000
we can estimate that there's there are

478
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:57,360
142

479
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,798
000

480
00:17:57,359 --> 00:18:02,798
ash trees

481
00:17:58,798 --> 00:18:02,798
street trees in new york state

482
00:18:03,359 --> 00:18:08,798
you know there's a fairly big range here

483
00:18:05,759 --> 00:18:10,798
is as to what the number could be and

484
00:18:08,798 --> 00:18:12,960
uh you know i have a feeling that if i

485
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:15,119
had more data that number would go down

486
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:17,038
but it is what it is

487
00:18:15,119 --> 00:18:20,399
there's a lot of variability in the data

488
00:18:17,038 --> 00:18:22,480
and it's sort of reflected in that range

489
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:24,960
so

490
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:26,160
what i did for ash i did for the most

491
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,759
prevalent

492
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:30,798
genera and so

493
00:18:27,759 --> 00:18:33,679
i estimated that there were about 1.8

494
00:18:30,798 --> 00:18:36,079
million maples in new york state

495
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:38,280
i can do the same thing for species and

496
00:18:36,079 --> 00:18:39,839
i estimated there are approximately

497
00:18:38,279 --> 00:18:43,839
864

498
00:18:39,839 --> 00:18:43,839
000 norway maples in new york state

499
00:18:44,798 --> 00:18:50,240
and that's that's useful information to

500
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:52,720
know if you have to budget for

501
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:54,079
planning statewide for ash removal for

502
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:55,839
instance

503
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:59,199
i was also asked to look at these the

504
00:18:55,839 --> 00:19:02,240
annual street tree benefits provided

505
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:04,558
on a statewide basis and okay

506
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:06,160
this number we know how many there's an

507
00:19:04,558 --> 00:19:08,558
estimate for how many street trees there

508
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:12,240
are i need to know the mean benefits per

509
00:19:08,558 --> 00:19:14,000
street trade now

510
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:15,919
as it happens

511
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,160
going back to lima

512
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:21,600
we can calculate this in this with using

513
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:23,360
this software and it's just an estimate

514
00:19:21,599 --> 00:19:25,279
but

515
00:19:23,359 --> 00:19:28,479
the estimate was that each street tree

516
00:19:25,279 --> 00:19:29,519
provides 132 dollars and 68 cents per

517
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:31,759
year

518
00:19:29,519 --> 00:19:34,079
uh per treat

519
00:19:31,759 --> 00:19:36,319
now what's interesting is that this

520
00:19:34,079 --> 00:19:39,279
number does not vary statewide which is

521
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:41,759
interesting because

522
00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:44,079
the density of plantings varies

523
00:19:41,759 --> 00:19:47,279
statewide but this number does not vary

524
00:19:44,079 --> 00:19:49,038
statewide so i didn't have to create a

525
00:19:47,279 --> 00:19:50,558
weighted statewide mean for this at all

526
00:19:49,038 --> 00:19:52,640
which is nice

527
00:19:50,558 --> 00:19:56,000
and when you plug that in

528
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:58,320
you get kicks out a number of statewide

529
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,200
annual benefits provided by street trees

530
00:19:58,319 --> 00:20:02,319
of

531
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:07,038
approximately 556 million dollars which

532
00:20:02,319 --> 00:20:09,678
is not insignificant um

533
00:20:07,038 --> 00:20:12,480
and you know there's a 90 confidence

534
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:12,480
interval as well

535
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:16,480
um

536
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:18,559
additionally because i went through a

537
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:20,480
lot of data and did a lot of summary

538
00:20:18,558 --> 00:20:22,558
statistics

539
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:24,720
we see other things going on in the

540
00:20:22,558 --> 00:20:26,720
street tree population

541
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:28,798
and one of the things has to do with

542
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:31,519
species diversity and the fact that

543
00:20:28,798 --> 00:20:32,798
species diversity

544
00:20:31,519 --> 00:20:34,960
these are two different species

545
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:38,400
diversity indices but they both indicate

546
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:41,840
that the further south we go the more

547
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,840
species diversity there is

548
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:45,360
and

549
00:20:43,359 --> 00:20:47,359
we also find that

550
00:20:45,359 --> 00:20:49,038
species diversity is greater for cities

551
00:20:47,359 --> 00:20:51,759
and for villages and

552
00:20:49,038 --> 00:20:54,558
what that seems to be about is that

553
00:20:51,759 --> 00:20:56,960
if cities and cities with greater

554
00:20:54,558 --> 00:20:59,839
financial resources typically are able

555
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:01,679
to hire a city or a city forester

556
00:20:59,839 --> 00:21:02,399
and the forester

557
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:03,519
is

558
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,038
knowledgeable enough to know that

559
00:21:03,519 --> 00:21:06,558
species diversity is an important

560
00:21:05,038 --> 00:21:08,720
consideration

561
00:21:06,558 --> 00:21:12,079
and and therefore plants accordingly and

562
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:12,079
we see this reflected here

563
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:17,679
what we also find is that

564
00:21:15,279 --> 00:21:20,960
it's not sufficient statewide

565
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:24,320
and there's a 20 rule for instance that

566
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:26,960
no one single street tree genus should

567
00:21:24,319 --> 00:21:28,639
exceed 20 percent of the population

568
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:30,240
and as we can see here the great

569
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:32,799
majority

570
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:35,519
of the poppy of the municipalities for

571
00:21:32,798 --> 00:21:37,519
which i have data

572
00:21:35,519 --> 00:21:39,839
exceed the 20 percent rule i mean some

573
00:21:37,519 --> 00:21:42,400
of these have percentages of maple

574
00:21:39,839 --> 00:21:45,038
between 70 and 80 percent which is

575
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:48,720
extraordinarily high

576
00:21:45,038 --> 00:21:51,519
so bottom line too many maples

577
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:55,120
and if we look at this graph of

578
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:58,000
tree diameter what we find is that well

579
00:21:55,119 --> 00:22:00,079
we need we would like to have more we

580
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,000
would like to have in the zero to six

581
00:22:00,079 --> 00:22:04,079
inch range we'd like to have more street

582
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:07,038
trees in this range here

583
00:22:04,079 --> 00:22:09,599
to compensate for the mortality of both

584
00:22:07,038 --> 00:22:12,480
young and old trees

585
00:22:09,599 --> 00:22:13,839
and we don't we have we have

586
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:16,079
the fact that this

587
00:22:13,839 --> 00:22:17,839
no this bars right here suggests

588
00:22:16,079 --> 00:22:18,960
strongly that we don't have there's not

589
00:22:17,839 --> 00:22:23,038
been enough

590
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:23,038
planting of new trees recently

591
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:25,919
which

592
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:29,360
is going to have a long-term effect on

593
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:29,360
the number of trees on the streets

594
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:34,480
um i also looked at sort of

595
00:22:32,558 --> 00:22:37,038
compared the

596
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:39,679
species composition for trees in the

597
00:22:37,038 --> 00:22:41,599
zero to six inch range to all the

598
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:43,440
composition in all trees and what you

599
00:22:41,599 --> 00:22:44,879
basically find

600
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:46,558
is that

601
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,760
this part's sort of good because you

602
00:22:46,558 --> 00:22:49,359
have you basically

603
00:22:47,759 --> 00:22:51,279
is basically suggesting that as a

604
00:22:49,359 --> 00:22:53,199
percentage of the population fewer

605
00:22:51,279 --> 00:22:55,519
maples are being planted

606
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:59,038
but what you also see is that we're

607
00:22:55,519 --> 00:23:00,240
having large numbers large increases in

608
00:22:59,038 --> 00:23:01,919
in

609
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:04,400
pears and in

610
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:08,080
crab apples things like that which is

611
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:11,759
going to lead to a structural change

612
00:23:08,079 --> 00:23:13,519
in the street tree population over time

613
00:23:11,759 --> 00:23:15,839
and that's sort of borne out by this

614
00:23:13,519 --> 00:23:17,359
graph which says that

615
00:23:15,839 --> 00:23:19,439
you know larger

616
00:23:17,359 --> 00:23:21,678
and medium-sized trees

617
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:24,880
are being planted less often than

618
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:24,880
smaller sized trees

619
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:33,519
what's very interesting is that this has

620
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:35,760
nothing this has

621
00:23:33,519 --> 00:23:38,000
power companies such as nice and

622
00:23:35,759 --> 00:23:40,240
national grid have made a big effort

623
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,839
recently in recent years

624
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:44,400
to suggest

625
00:23:41,839 --> 00:23:46,000
and rightly so that smaller sized trees

626
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:49,120
should be planted under

627
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:52,159
single and triple phase utility wires

628
00:23:49,119 --> 00:23:54,639
and that's good that should be done

629
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:57,360
however

630
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:59,600
if you look at whether utility wires are

631
00:23:57,359 --> 00:24:01,199
present or not what you see is that

632
00:23:59,599 --> 00:24:04,000
irrespective

633
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:06,319
of utility wires that the that more

634
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:09,119
there is a trend toward planting

635
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:11,519
uh more smaller sized trees and there's

636
00:24:09,119 --> 00:24:13,038
no graph to illustrate it here but it's

637
00:24:11,519 --> 00:24:14,960
true as well

638
00:24:13,038 --> 00:24:16,240
with respect to planting volume if you

639
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:18,400
look at

640
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:20,400
planting sites such as

641
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:23,600
somebody's front lawn

642
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:25,278
or yard where there is no essentially no

643
00:24:23,599 --> 00:24:27,839
restriction on planting volume you'll

644
00:24:25,278 --> 00:24:29,759
see that increasingly

645
00:24:27,839 --> 00:24:33,240
smaller sized trees are being planted

646
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:33,240
there as well

647
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:39,839
now

648
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:42,480
i hypothesized and found that

649
00:24:39,839 --> 00:24:44,879
the most explanatory power

650
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:47,919
for the data i had had to do with plant

651
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:50,000
hardiness and my plan in the 1990

652
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:51,440
usda plant hardiness zones but that

653
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,440
isn't to say that there aren't other

654
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:54,400
correlations with street tree data there

655
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:56,640
are

656
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:59,200
medium household income

657
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:01,038
annual precipitation and type in

658
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:02,000
municipality whether it's a city a

659
00:25:01,038 --> 00:25:05,278
village

660
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,079
or or a census designated place does

661
00:25:05,278 --> 00:25:09,278
have

662
00:25:06,079 --> 00:25:10,720
a correlation but what i found was that

663
00:25:09,278 --> 00:25:13,200
number one

664
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:16,159
the plant hardness zone had by far the

665
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:18,400
most explanatory value and that

666
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:20,000
these variables were were

667
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,798
multi-collinear

668
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,480
with

669
00:25:20,798 --> 00:25:24,319
with this one so i couldn't really use

670
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:27,120
it just tossed it out now that doesn't

671
00:25:24,319 --> 00:25:29,519
mean that if we went to another state

672
00:25:27,119 --> 00:25:31,759
for instance we went to washington state

673
00:25:29,519 --> 00:25:33,599
it could be that annual precipitation

674
00:25:31,759 --> 00:25:37,119
would be

675
00:25:33,599 --> 00:25:39,678
more significant but in new york state

676
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:39,678
it's not

677
00:25:41,119 --> 00:25:45,199
so uh

678
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:47,600
i was asked by the dec to take my

679
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:50,000
initial findings and then go out and do

680
00:25:47,599 --> 00:25:52,000
some additional inventories

681
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,200
and see how those the data from those

682
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:56,798
inventories

683
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:59,519
compared to my initial findings and i

684
00:25:56,798 --> 00:26:01,200
did five villages uh

685
00:25:59,519 --> 00:26:04,558
shortsville

686
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:06,319
and and lima are in in zone six but yeah

687
00:26:04,558 --> 00:26:08,480
and i have one but i had one at least

688
00:26:06,319 --> 00:26:11,038
one from each zone and i did

689
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:13,278
uh intensive you know

690
00:26:11,038 --> 00:26:14,240
street tree inventories on foot for each

691
00:26:13,278 --> 00:26:15,839
of these

692
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:19,120
uh five

693
00:26:15,839 --> 00:26:19,119
uh they're all villages

694
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:24,080
what i found is that you know is the

695
00:26:21,839 --> 00:26:24,959
data exactly the same no but basically

696
00:26:24,079 --> 00:26:26,960
you see

697
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:28,159
very similar trends

698
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,278
between

699
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:31,120
how many

700
00:26:29,278 --> 00:26:33,440
how many trees per unit stream length

701
00:26:31,119 --> 00:26:36,158
are planted i mean as you go further

702
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:39,200
south you get more trees

703
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:40,880
planted per per unit street length

704
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:43,038
and

705
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:45,760
fewer maples as we get down to when i

706
00:26:43,038 --> 00:26:46,879
went to great neck plaza which is nassau

707
00:26:45,759 --> 00:26:49,440
county

708
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:50,840
fewer maples were planted

709
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:53,519
which is what i would

710
00:26:50,839 --> 00:26:54,798
expect similarly

711
00:26:53,519 --> 00:26:57,038
more

712
00:26:54,798 --> 00:26:59,359
oaks were planted higher percentage of

713
00:26:57,038 --> 00:26:59,359
oaks

714
00:26:59,599 --> 00:27:04,798
norway maples you know you see that

715
00:27:02,319 --> 00:27:06,960
spike up here and then goes down we get

716
00:27:04,798 --> 00:27:09,599
to further south

717
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:11,360
and same with london plane tree

718
00:27:09,599 --> 00:27:13,119
now you know they're not exactly the

719
00:27:11,359 --> 00:27:16,158
same but i think they're reflective of

720
00:27:13,119 --> 00:27:16,158
the overall trends

721
00:27:17,278 --> 00:27:21,440
if you look at the tree tri diameter

722
00:27:19,119 --> 00:27:23,119
profiles for the five villages i went to

723
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:25,278
very similar

724
00:27:23,119 --> 00:27:29,439
you know not enough trees in this

725
00:27:25,278 --> 00:27:29,440
particular zero to six inch category

726
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:34,720
so

727
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:36,720
i concluded that yeah you know i was on

728
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:39,679
the right track that what i did seems to

729
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:41,839
be fairly accurate um

730
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:44,640
and my test inventory statistics don't

731
00:27:41,839 --> 00:27:46,319
completely agree with my zone class

732
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:48,159
level statistics but

733
00:27:46,319 --> 00:27:50,079
they seem to reflect the overall trend

734
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:51,120
that i found in the data

735
00:27:50,079 --> 00:27:53,119
however

736
00:27:51,119 --> 00:27:54,879
what's important to know and it can't be

737
00:27:53,119 --> 00:27:56,639
emphasized enough is these greninic

738
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:58,799
plaza in kensington are

739
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:01,360
contiguous you can put one foot in great

740
00:27:58,798 --> 00:28:03,440
neck plaza and one foot in kensington

741
00:28:01,359 --> 00:28:05,918
but their pop their street tree

742
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:09,759
populations are quite different

743
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:11,840
and uh they're somewhat different in

744
00:28:09,759 --> 00:28:14,480
in their planting types for instance all

745
00:28:11,839 --> 00:28:16,798
the trees in kensington are planted not

746
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:19,360
in the tree lawn but in the front lawn

747
00:28:16,798 --> 00:28:20,158
here which is part of the right of way

748
00:28:19,359 --> 00:28:22,719
so

749
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:24,960
there is a lot of variability

750
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:28,880
from one municipality to the next

751
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:28,880
irrespective of geographic difference

752
00:28:29,038 --> 00:28:35,599
it's just the nature of the beast

753
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:38,000
so conclusions from all this analysis

754
00:28:35,599 --> 00:28:40,319
one clue conclusion is that we need more

755
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,880
species diversity we need more diversity

756
00:28:40,319 --> 00:28:45,439
of both the species species and genus

757
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:47,120
level for street trees you know it's

758
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:49,679
like the maple that ate

759
00:28:47,119 --> 00:28:51,759
or all the other species here

760
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:53,679
too many maples

761
00:28:51,759 --> 00:28:55,200
why is that important well this was hope

762
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:56,960
plaza

763
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:58,798
it was american elm and the american

764
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:01,519
elmo died because of dutch elm disease

765
00:28:58,798 --> 00:29:03,839
and had to be replanted

766
00:29:01,519 --> 00:29:06,240
this is worcester mass

767
00:29:03,839 --> 00:29:08,480
i believe these are all norway maples

768
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:11,359
the asian longhorn beetle really likes

769
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:12,880
maples they had an infestation of

770
00:29:11,359 --> 00:29:14,319
asian longhorn beetle they had to cut

771
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:16,399
all the trees down that's what it looks

772
00:29:14,319 --> 00:29:20,240
like now if you had more species

773
00:29:16,398 --> 00:29:20,239
diversity there would be less

774
00:29:21,839 --> 00:29:25,359
even if you had the asian lore orbital

775
00:29:23,839 --> 00:29:28,158
hopefully your street wouldn't be

776
00:29:25,359 --> 00:29:28,158
reduced to that

777
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:34,159
we need more planting of trees to at

778
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:36,319
least maintain population the population

779
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:39,200
at the current level now it's very easy

780
00:29:36,319 --> 00:29:43,200
to stip to sort of call for 500 000 new

781
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:44,798
trees that's a lot of money i

782
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:47,278
i don't think new york state is going to

783
00:29:44,798 --> 00:29:49,119
be funding 500 000

784
00:29:47,278 --> 00:29:51,200
or 600 000 new street trees because you

785
00:29:49,119 --> 00:29:52,719
have to think about mortality of your of

786
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,919
your plantings

787
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:56,319
it's probably not going to happen

788
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:58,799
anytime soon but that's something that

789
00:29:56,319 --> 00:29:58,798
we need

790
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:05,840
because

791
00:30:03,519 --> 00:30:07,440
larger

792
00:30:05,839 --> 00:30:09,439
sized

793
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:13,200
trees

794
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:15,120
provide more ecosystem benefits

795
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:16,480
we

796
00:30:15,119 --> 00:30:17,839
emphasize

797
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:19,519
where plantings

798
00:30:17,839 --> 00:30:22,398
volume is adequate and you don't have

799
00:30:19,519 --> 00:30:26,240
overhead wires to plant larger growing

800
00:30:22,398 --> 00:30:28,239
and medium-sized growing trees

801
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:29,919
it's not really being done

802
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:31,440
at the moment there's a trend towards

803
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:33,038
planting smaller sized trees for

804
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:35,038
whatever reason

805
00:30:33,038 --> 00:30:37,119
and if we look at this data that was

806
00:30:35,038 --> 00:30:39,759
collected by ohio state where they

807
00:30:37,119 --> 00:30:41,278
compared the growth of uh

808
00:30:39,759 --> 00:30:43,839
cretagus

809
00:30:41,278 --> 00:30:45,359
and gallaudet there's a there's a great

810
00:30:43,839 --> 00:30:49,199
there's a tremendous

811
00:30:45,359 --> 00:30:49,199
difference in the amount of uh

812
00:30:49,359 --> 00:30:52,798
and the size of the tree and the leaf

813
00:30:51,038 --> 00:30:54,879
surface provided by the tree and if you

814
00:30:52,798 --> 00:30:57,119
sort of plug this into

815
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:58,559
this this uh forest service program

816
00:30:57,119 --> 00:31:01,359
basically

817
00:30:58,558 --> 00:31:03,440
the cortegas the uh the honey locust the

818
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:05,599
ditzy is providing eight times roughly

819
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:07,919
eight times the amount of benefits

820
00:31:05,599 --> 00:31:09,278
provided by the cortegas it's a it's a

821
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:11,120
big difference

822
00:31:09,278 --> 00:31:13,759
you know eight times the amount of

823
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:18,038
stormwater mitigation provided by the

824
00:31:13,759 --> 00:31:18,038
gleditsia as opposed to the protagonist

825
00:31:18,079 --> 00:31:22,079
so what's going on is that we're

826
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:23,759
basically

827
00:31:22,079 --> 00:31:26,720
we're we

828
00:31:23,759 --> 00:31:29,038
we're programming a reduction

829
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:31,120
in ecosystem benefits provided by street

830
00:31:29,038 --> 00:31:33,519
trees street trees are roughly

831
00:31:31,119 --> 00:31:35,519
10 to 20 percent of

832
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:38,720
of the urban forests you know it's not

833
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:40,480
an insignificant component

834
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:42,960
and the forest service has spent a lot

835
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:44,960
of time and a lot of energy trying to

836
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:46,720
get out the message that street tree

837
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:48,399
benefits are important

838
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:50,720
and the question that needs to be asked

839
00:31:48,398 --> 00:31:51,518
is is this message being heard and if

840
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:53,519
not

841
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:56,880
how can the message be

842
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:56,880
retooled so it is heard

843
00:31:58,319 --> 00:32:02,798
and lastly

844
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:02,799
i was asked to

845
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:08,558
use methods that could be replicated by

846
00:32:05,759 --> 00:32:08,558
other states

847
00:32:09,759 --> 00:32:14,798
what i did this assessment depends on

848
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:16,559
having enough street tree inventory data

849
00:32:14,798 --> 00:32:17,679
that's broadly distributed throughout

850
00:32:16,558 --> 00:32:20,000
the state

851
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:20,000
which

852
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:24,880
is not so easy

853
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:26,799
it's a bit it's an important issue it's

854
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:27,679
hard to say new york state has a lot of

855
00:32:26,798 --> 00:32:30,079
data

856
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:31,840
and also uh you know here at cornell

857
00:32:30,079 --> 00:32:33,439
through the swap program we've generated

858
00:32:31,839 --> 00:32:36,319
a lot of data

859
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:39,440
so it's hard to say whether other states

860
00:32:36,319 --> 00:32:42,480
have enough data that could be used to

861
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:44,640
rep to replicate what was done here

862
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:46,480
the other thing is probably not as as

863
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:50,240
obvious is that you need

864
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:50,240
data about streets because

865
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:54,399
we need to have

866
00:32:51,839 --> 00:32:57,439
we need to use gis to go through the

867
00:32:54,398 --> 00:33:00,239
street data to do what was done here

868
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:02,080
and presumably we can do that

869
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:03,599
through departments of transportation in

870
00:33:02,079 --> 00:33:05,359
those states

871
00:33:03,599 --> 00:33:07,359
and lastly the other thing to consider

872
00:33:05,359 --> 00:33:10,319
is that you know in new york state plant

873
00:33:07,359 --> 00:33:12,000
hardiness zone was

874
00:33:10,319 --> 00:33:14,158
the best predictor val

875
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:16,000
variable but not as i mentioned before

876
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:18,559
it's not necessarily true may not

877
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:20,880
necessarily be true in other states

878
00:33:18,558 --> 00:33:23,519
and to try it in another state and see

879
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:23,519
what happens

880
00:33:23,599 --> 00:33:27,359
so

881
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:29,278
i would like to acknowledge uh my

882
00:33:27,359 --> 00:33:31,439
committee nina basic peter troubridge

883
00:33:29,278 --> 00:33:33,839
and joe francis they've been extremely

884
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:35,278
helpful and i appreciate their their

885
00:33:33,839 --> 00:33:36,879
wisdom throughout the years and it's

886
00:33:35,278 --> 00:33:39,679
great to have advisors who are older

887
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:41,120
than i am

888
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:44,080
which is hard

889
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:45,278
i'd like to thank the united the new

municipalities and and

894
00:33:52,798 --> 00:33:58,158
urban forestry companies and

895
00:33:55,919 --> 00:34:01,200
individuals who had the data and who

896
00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:03,039
provided it to me

897
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:04,159
i would be remiss if i didn't thank the

898
00:34:03,038 --> 00:34:06,960
cornell

900
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:09,679
who

901
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:11,280
not only

902
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:12,960
collected a lot of the data during the

903
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:15,839
fall but helped me

904
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:18,079
over a summer or two collecting data as

905
00:34:15,838 --> 00:34:20,320
well

906
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:21,760
and i'd like to thank the departments of

907
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:23,519
horticulture and landscape architecture

908
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:25,040
for putting up for putting up with me

909
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:26,800
for all these years

910
00:34:25,039 --> 00:34:29,199
and lastly i'd like to thank

911

my wife diana and my kids who have also

912
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:31,598
put up with me for a lot of years as

913
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:33,519
well

914
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:36,720
so thank you i'll be

915
00:34:33,519 --> 00:34:36,719
happy to answer any questions

916
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:50,399
it was that clear huh yeah

917
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:52,878
i wonder if you

918
00:34:50,398 --> 00:34:54,638
did you look at things on a finer scale

919
00:34:52,878 --> 00:34:57,118
or was it too difficult and thinking of

920
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:58,880
some examples could be like street use

921
00:34:57,119 --> 00:35:00,079
type you could have divided it into

922
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:02,240
residential

923
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:04,320
in each of the zones versus commercial

924
00:35:02,239 --> 00:35:06,319
versus intensive residential or

925
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:08,240
something i definitely did look at that

926
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:09,519
um

927
00:35:08,239 --> 00:35:11,598
and

928
00:35:09,519 --> 00:35:14,800
that is exactly the problem

929
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:16,800
the problem is taking data at that scale

930
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:18,560
and extrapolating upwards partly because

931
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:20,720
not everybody collects data at that

932
00:35:18,559 --> 00:35:23,039
scale and the data that you're talking

933
00:35:20,719 --> 00:35:25,039
about has to be geo-referenced meaning

934
00:35:23,039 --> 00:35:26,320
it has to each tree has to have an x and

935
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:28,480
y coordinate

936
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:30,320
so you have to know exactly where it is

937
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:32,480
not everybody collects that data not

938
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:35,039
everybody collects street address

939
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:37,199
so so and then it has to be correlated

940
00:35:35,039 --> 00:35:38,320
with measures such as land use and stuff

941
00:35:37,199 --> 00:35:39,838
like that

942
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:41,359
which

943
00:35:39,838 --> 00:35:44,159
may be accurate may not be accurate

944
00:35:41,358 --> 00:35:45,920
that's another scale issue so i think

945
00:35:44,159 --> 00:35:47,759
that is the way to go

946
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:50,079
but at this

947
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:50,960
in this analysis at this level at this

948
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:51,839
time

949
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:54,960
um

950
00:35:51,838 --> 00:35:56,799
you know i my uh i did i did do what

951
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:59,838
you're talking about but

952
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:59,839
i wasn't comfortable

953
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:03,599
drawing too many conclusions from what i

954
00:36:02,559 --> 00:36:06,719
actually

955
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:08,640
uh analyzed i have a reduced amount of

956
00:36:06,719 --> 00:36:09,679
data at the level that you're talking

957
00:36:08,639 --> 00:36:12,639
about

958
00:36:09,679 --> 00:36:14,319
and so looking at both geographic uh

959
00:36:12,639 --> 00:36:16,639
variability

960
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:18,000
and differences in land use and other

961
00:36:16,639 --> 00:36:20,159
variables it you know i was sort of

962
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:22,800
running out of room

963
00:36:20,159 --> 00:36:25,279
in terms of the data didn't we uh

964
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:27,039
our swat inventories had

965
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:30,160
would you reference but

966
00:36:27,039 --> 00:36:32,000
most inventories don't take gps a lot of

967
00:36:30,159 --> 00:36:34,078
them yeah most

968
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:38,159
it's hard they do but

969
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:38,160
it's very uneven and um

970
00:36:39,039 --> 00:36:42,400
you kind of i'm kind of limited you know

971
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:44,320
that's that's exactly the right question

972
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:46,480
that's a great question and something i

973
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:48,880
struggle with all the time and and

974
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:51,440
it's just uh

975
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:54,480
not everybody collects the same data

976
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:56,639
in the same way at the same level

977
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:59,920
and it creates a lot of challenges so

978
00:36:56,639 --> 00:37:01,519
you know it's frustrating because

979
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:03,440
when you extrapolate to the statewide

980
00:37:01,519 --> 00:37:05,039
level you're sort of not answering a lot

981
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:06,639
of questions but that's those are the

982
00:37:05,039 --> 00:37:10,320
only questions those are the questions i

983
00:37:06,639 --> 00:37:10,319
i was i felt comfortable answering

984
00:37:10,719 --> 00:37:16,159
oh we have a question in geneva sure

985
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:16,159
yes

986
00:37:17,519 --> 00:37:23,440
um yeah i have this alan like so our

987
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:26,400
question in a comment uh on the i tree

988
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:27,679
uh model of the forest service develop

989
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:29,838
is that

990
00:37:27,679 --> 00:37:31,838
does that take into account the

991
00:37:29,838 --> 00:37:34,559
difference in ecosystem services that

992
00:37:31,838 --> 00:37:37,358
you get with an isolated tree versus

993
00:37:34,559 --> 00:37:39,599
similar tree in a forest

994
00:37:37,358 --> 00:37:42,078
because an isolated tree will intercept

995
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:44,240
lateral light and

996
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:46,640
you get quite different numbers if

997
00:37:44,239 --> 00:37:51,039
if it's isolated versus within a within

998
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:53,838
a stand the short answer is yes

999
00:37:51,039 --> 00:37:55,759
yeah those programs the i tree programs

1000
00:37:53,838 --> 00:37:57,838
that i use are specifically

1001
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:59,920
uh targeted on to street trees they have

1002
00:37:57,838 --> 00:38:02,920
another program that looks at forest

1003
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:02,920
stands

1004
00:38:04,159 --> 00:38:07,039
trees

1005
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:09,200
but the

1006
00:38:07,039 --> 00:38:10,559
forest service also does it on a span

1007
00:38:09,199 --> 00:38:12,078
basis

1008
00:38:10,559 --> 00:38:14,799
right

1009
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:16,240
i think we have one more also uh just a

1010
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:19,359
comment we uh

1011
00:38:16,239 --> 00:38:21,598
for vineyards we've worked with uh

1012
00:38:19,358 --> 00:38:23,838
art digotano and the climate center and

1013
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:25,119
he's generated a much more high

1014
00:38:23,838 --> 00:38:28,799
resolution

1015
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:30,720
uh temperature climatology

1016
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:32,400
at the three by three

1017
00:38:30,719 --> 00:38:34,559
mile scale

1018
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:35,280
and that's available uh

1019
00:38:34,559 --> 00:38:37,440
to

1020
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:39,599
you know potentially be a lot more uh

1021
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:42,079
high resolution than those no i

1022
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:45,280
understand i understand that and uh

1023
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:48,160
oregon state has a prism model and they

1024
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:51,119
have 30-year normals and all that stuff

1025
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:52,480
and i i started off using that

1026
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:53,920
and

1027
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:56,240
it actually

1028
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:56,240
um

1029
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:58,880
actually

1030
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:00,960
i don't think it works as well for what

1031
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:02,559
i was doing for whatever reason

1032
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:04,639
um

1033
00:39:02,559 --> 00:39:06,639
it's also not as widely available it's

1034
00:39:04,639 --> 00:39:07,679
not as easy to get it's not as easy to

1035
00:39:06,639 --> 00:39:10,879
use

1036
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:12,319
and so you know uh ult that's how i

1037
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:14,559
started off working with with

1038
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:16,720
temperature hardness and i wound up

1039
00:39:14,559 --> 00:39:18,000
going back to the or went up going to

1040
00:39:16,719 --> 00:39:20,879
the to the

1041
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:23,760
to the usda zones as as cumbersome and

1042
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:26,000
as clumsy and as

1043
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:28,880
out of date as they may be i'd be very

1044
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:31,039
interested to see the updated zones

1045
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:33,119
and see how that affects this type of

1046
00:39:31,039 --> 00:39:35,519
analysis

1047
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:39,119
you know i think prism isn't very useful

1048
00:39:35,519 --> 00:39:40,880
because they give you averages

1049
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:43,358
this this one we can

1050
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:46,880
i can tell you what percentage of the

1051
00:39:43,358 --> 00:39:49,598
winters fell below specific temperatures

1052
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:51,280
at a five by five kilometer great scale

1053
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:52,960
for the whole state so

1054
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:56,320
you may want to look into that i can

1055
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:58,559
send you more information okay thank you

1056
00:39:56,320 --> 00:40:01,039
take me a little more i've got a comment

1057
00:39:58,559 --> 00:40:03,759
right this martin goblin

1058
00:40:01,039 --> 00:40:05,119
i'm on the city of geneva's changing

1059
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:08,240
committee

1060
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:11,280
and i'd like to comment on the

1061
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:12,799
statement you made about large species

1062
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:16,000
no longer being

1063
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:18,880
involved now i guess we cut

1064
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:21,920
cut our own arm off and that

1065
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:21,920
we do have more

1066
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:29,440
access to urban

1067
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:32,480
foresters and so on that advise us and

1068
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:35,280
we're no longer human planting a large

1069
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:37,039
species anywhere under a wire

1070
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:39,119
so right away

1071
00:40:37,039 --> 00:40:41,119
we're doing away half of the street

1072
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:43,119
trees on any one street because they're

1073
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:43,838
on one side of the street

1074
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:46,079
so

1075
00:40:43,838 --> 00:40:47,759
we're going to be stuck with large trees

1076
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:49,920
on one side

1077
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:50,720
and small medium trees on the other side

1078
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:53,358
which

1079
00:40:50,719 --> 00:40:55,838
i suppose it's diverse but it's not a

1080
00:40:53,358 --> 00:40:57,598
very pleasing look

1081
00:40:55,838 --> 00:40:59,679
well one thing you we might want to

1082
00:40:57,599 --> 00:41:02,079
think about is

1083
00:40:59,679 --> 00:41:04,159
on the side of the street with the wires

1084
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:06,318
not planting in the tree lawn

1085
00:41:04,159 --> 00:41:07,519
and maybe we plant in the front yard or

1086
00:41:06,318 --> 00:41:09,119
lawn of the

1087
00:41:07,519 --> 00:41:10,800
of the parcel

1088
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:12,720
and uh

1089
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:15,119
then you could

1090
00:41:12,719 --> 00:41:17,358
potentially plant a larger sized tree

1091
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:19,920
and not have the

1092
00:41:17,358 --> 00:41:20,719
displeasing aesthetic which is what

1093
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:22,559
you're

1094
00:41:20,719 --> 00:41:24,799
talking about

1095
00:41:22,559 --> 00:41:24,799
right

1096
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:28,079
well there is

1097
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:32,559
uh it's an educational thing

1098
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:35,119
to the to the homeowner to allow a tree

1099
00:41:32,559 --> 00:41:37,440
they tend to not fare well when a person

1100
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:39,680
doesn't want them in their lawn

1101
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:41,920
but uh if we educate people and get a

1102
00:41:39,679 --> 00:41:43,679
setback agreement uh that's actually

1103
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:45,599
signed so that the city takes care of

1104
00:41:43,679 --> 00:41:49,799
those trees we have had a few that have

1105
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:49,800
come forward and one in a larger

1106
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:54,079
i just think it's something that we

1107
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:56,318
could consider moving forward that

1108
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:59,280
the traditional model of planting trees

1109
00:41:56,318 --> 00:42:00,800
and tree lawns along the street maybe we

1110
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:03,280
could rethink that a little bit that's

1111
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:06,079
all

1112
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:06,079
thanks yep

1113
00:42:07,199 --> 00:42:14,759
yes ken do the utility companies

1114
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:14,760
exaggerate the problem of trees

1115
00:42:19,838 --> 00:42:25,519
do utility companies exaggerate the

1116
00:42:22,559 --> 00:42:25,519
problem of trees under

1117
00:42:29,519 --> 00:42:33,679
i wires have uh

1118
00:42:31,358 --> 00:42:35,838
i just heard an nvr this morning that

1119
00:42:33,679 --> 00:42:38,559
there's a call to

1120
00:42:35,838 --> 00:42:40,318
not plant trees near wires

1121
00:42:38,559 --> 00:42:42,000
and all in connecticut after people

1122
00:42:40,318 --> 00:42:45,039
still don't have power there

1123
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:46,000
after the week of the snowstorm but uh

1124
00:42:45,039 --> 00:42:48,318
i mean there are different types of

1125
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:49,838
wires i think what fred talked about is

1126
00:42:48,318 --> 00:42:51,679
single and triple phase which are the

1127
00:42:49,838 --> 00:42:53,440
tall ones and there's table of thick

1128
00:42:51,679 --> 00:42:55,838
ones those are cable

1129
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:56,960
and power you know fiber optics and

1130
00:42:55,838 --> 00:42:59,519
they're not the ones that we're

1131
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:02,000
concerned about as much as the high ones

1132
00:42:59,519 --> 00:43:03,599
a single and triple phase that

1133
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,838
is a fire hazard because they're not

1134
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:07,119
well insulated and then there's also

1135
00:43:05,838 --> 00:43:09,599
potential for

1136
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:11,358
stopping power if the trees come down

1137
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:13,200
i think it's a valid thing

1138
00:43:11,358 --> 00:43:14,880
to plant trees that mature at a height

1139
00:43:13,199 --> 00:43:17,279
of 30 feet

1140
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:19,200
that's why those wires are above 30 feet

1141
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:22,480
versus uh you know having to plant

1142
00:43:19,199 --> 00:43:24,399
really small trees but

1143
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:26,559
but when you don't have the high between

1144
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:28,160
triple phase in a single phase you can

1145
00:43:26,559 --> 00:43:30,559
plant victory that's back to typica when

1146
00:43:28,159 --> 00:43:33,118
we do do plant big trees if you just

1147
00:43:30,559 --> 00:43:34,559
have cable and fiber optics which are

1148
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:37,039
those thick wires we'll plant right

1149
00:43:34,559 --> 00:43:37,039
through this

1150
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:41,440
is there

1151
00:43:39,199 --> 00:43:43,919
you have a level of saturation with how

1152
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:46,079
many trees are

1153
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:48,079
feasible to even have per

1154
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:50,318
mile kilometer of street and then also

1155
00:43:48,079 --> 00:43:51,280
can you correlate your tree diameter

1156
00:43:50,318 --> 00:43:52,960
size

1157
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:54,880
with how old the street is i'm just

1158
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:56,639
wondering you say we don't have big or

1159
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:58,000
small trees to take the place of the

1160
00:43:56,639 --> 00:43:59,759
older trees but

1161
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,119
we have a point of saturation with some

1162
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:02,319
of the oldest streets they already have

1163
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:04,960
on uh

1164
00:44:02,318 --> 00:44:07,920
two densest saturation trees to allow

1165
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:10,240
the small trees even

1166
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:11,440
special niche

1167
00:44:10,239 --> 00:44:13,919
well you probably know more about this

1168
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:15,920
than i do but um

1169
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:17,920
yeah you can't plant

1170
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:19,440
of course you can't plant a tree every

1171
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:22,960
five feet but

1172
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:25,119
you can definitely plan for a

1173
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:26,800
newer tree you see it all the time where

1174
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:27,760
you have great big old sugar maples

1175
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:29,680
let's say

1176
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:30,960
and and younger trees getting planted

1177
00:44:29,679 --> 00:44:33,118
between them

1178
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:34,960
on the theory that on the on the plant

1179
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:37,280
looking ahead they're gonna or will

1180
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:39,599
remove the older

1181
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:41,839
probably possibly diseased structurally

1182
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:43,599
deficient sugar maple and allow let the

1183
00:44:41,838 --> 00:44:45,279
new the younger tree to get established

1184
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:49,280
and then remove the tree

1185
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:52,160
yeah you you there are and and how

1186
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:54,160
how uh what how on center what the

1187
00:44:52,159 --> 00:44:56,000
distance on center i mean that's that's

1188
00:44:54,159 --> 00:44:58,239
that's kind of a question of being

1189
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:00,400
discussed right now i know in syracuse

1190
00:44:58,239 --> 00:45:02,879
is what is the proper distance between

1191
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:04,960
tree plantings you know is it better to

1192
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:06,240
have a greater distance or a smaller

1193
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:08,639
distance

1194
00:45:06,239 --> 00:45:10,000
but yeah i mean that's

1195
00:45:08,639 --> 00:45:11,920
kind of what the forest service has been

1196
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:13,519
interested you can't just plant it it's

1197
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:16,960
great to say yeah we'll plant a million

1198
00:45:13,519 --> 00:45:16,960
trees in new york city but where

1199
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:22,319
you know um i'm not sure if i answered

1200
00:45:19,519 --> 00:45:22,318
your question but

1201
00:45:23,199 --> 00:45:26,719
did i well i was wondering you know if

1202
00:45:25,199 --> 00:45:28,399
there's a correlation with the smaller

1203
00:45:26,719 --> 00:45:30,480
trees just because maybe

1204
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:31,838
new rule construction has been

1205
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:33,280
there's that correlation there that's

1206
00:45:31,838 --> 00:45:34,799
the whole reason why we're having this

1207
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:36,480
the younger the smaller trees is

1208
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:38,560
something they've seen in california

1209
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:40,240
they've seen it in many different states

1210
00:45:38,559 --> 00:45:42,239
i didn't make that up it's been and it's

1211
00:45:40,239 --> 00:45:44,318
not unique to new york city

1212
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:46,799
new york state um

1213
00:45:44,318 --> 00:45:49,119
everywhere uh i you know you can

1214
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:51,200
speculate i mean to some extent it's

1215
00:45:49,119 --> 00:45:52,160
it's a function of uh

1216
00:45:51,199 --> 00:45:54,000
uh

1217
00:45:52,159 --> 00:45:55,920
departments of public works that usually

1218
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:57,838
typically maintain and

1219
00:45:55,920 --> 00:46:00,318
and plant the trees consider those

1220
00:45:57,838 --> 00:46:01,920
smaller trees to be easier to maintain

1221
00:46:00,318 --> 00:46:03,358
and so they're more inclined to plant

1222
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:04,960
them

1223
00:46:03,358 --> 00:46:06,719
and that may be true in the short term

1224
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:08,559
that's not necessarily necessarily true

1225
00:46:06,719 --> 00:46:10,480
in the long term they're looking at

1226
00:46:08,559 --> 00:46:13,279
reduced maintenance costs which is a big

1227
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:15,199
concern of theirs

1228
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:18,160
but you know there's possibly also in it

1229
00:46:15,199 --> 00:46:20,239
i i thought about maybe there's just how

1230
00:46:18,159 --> 00:46:22,399
we think of the street

1231
00:46:20,239 --> 00:46:24,559
has changed i mean we're no longer such

1232
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:27,280
a pedestrian-oriented society we're kind

1233
00:46:24,559 --> 00:46:29,358
of a drive-through society

1234
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:31,119
and maybe that's part of it we don't

1235
00:46:29,358 --> 00:46:33,920
look for the same thing from trees that

1236
00:46:31,119 --> 00:46:35,920
we use now that we used to but it's it's

1237
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:38,559
not on you it's not unique to new york

1238
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:39,440
state is it this trend of smaller

1239
00:46:38,559 --> 00:46:43,000
smaller

1240
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:43,000
sized plantings

1241
00:46:44,159 --> 00:46:47,759
yes tom

1242
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:48,720
fred did you come up with a number for

1243
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:51,119
the

1244
00:46:48,719 --> 00:46:54,000
the number of trees that

1245
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:57,200
could be planted yeah

1246
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:59,679
no okay no

1247
00:46:57,199 --> 00:47:01,838
absolutely not we have those for our

1248
00:46:59,679 --> 00:47:04,078
40 swat cities that we've done that's a

1249
00:47:01,838 --> 00:47:05,838
real scale issue yeah but we don't have

1250
00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:11,079
it for the other

1251
00:47:05,838 --> 00:47:11,078
places and on a statewide basis that's

1252
00:47:17,519 --> 00:47:21,480
okay well thanks very much
