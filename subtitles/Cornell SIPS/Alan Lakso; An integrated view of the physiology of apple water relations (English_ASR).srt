1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:33,149
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:02,229 --> 00:00:33,149
University to be here today

3
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:44,169
four years or so before every Tiger

4
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:48,010
development an actor as well so I

5
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:50,649
thought it would be usable with a lot of

6
00:00:48,009 --> 00:00:54,099
a lot of studies over the years it's any

7
00:00:50,649 --> 00:00:56,920
different components of a system and its

8
00:00:54,100 --> 00:01:03,160
kind of couple to then stand back people

9
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:07,680
look at the whole system interact so I

10
00:01:03,159 --> 00:01:11,500
thought a lot of relations would be a

11
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:16,360
complexity erections that would be an

12
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:18,930
interest we Apple first you're all

13
00:01:16,359 --> 00:01:21,039
familiar with domestic apples in general

14
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:25,200
but they actually have the center of

15
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:27,250
origin mountain Kazakhstan that turns on

16
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:32,579
mountains didn't this is actually a

17
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:41,349
picture of Apple force in in Kazakhstan

18
00:01:32,578 --> 00:01:45,429
where the primary trees are and so the

19
00:01:41,349 --> 00:01:47,019
commercial varieties came from there it

20
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:50,020
turns out that there seems to be a

21
00:01:47,019 --> 00:01:52,929
rather narrow gene pool so that our

22
00:01:50,019 --> 00:01:55,539
commercial varieties are relatively

23
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:57,610
close to the wild types and there's been

24
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:58,270
very little of any breeding for water

25
00:01:57,609 --> 00:02:01,090
relations

26
00:01:58,269 --> 00:02:06,548
I've been primarily for yield and

27
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:08,890
quality and sustainable bearing but not

28
00:02:06,549 --> 00:02:11,620
for a water relation so we're really

29
00:02:08,889 --> 00:02:13,339
thinking of the plant as wild land and

30
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:16,099
so

31
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:19,909
the climate they're in there and it's

32
00:02:16,098 --> 00:02:23,929
hard to get good data from this area but

33
00:02:19,909 --> 00:02:30,650
it appears to be an area with some dry

34
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:32,360
periods in this number but not period

35
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:35,930
where it seems to be a moderate climate

36
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:38,810
with with dry periods in the summer

37
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:43,930
I personally leave size and shape

38
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:49,219
suggests this type of climate so we

39
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:52,849
think the physiology way of looking at

40
00:02:49,219 --> 00:02:58,250
at water relations was suggested by Neal

41
00:02:52,849 --> 00:03:03,049
Turner to look at perform at or looking

42
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:06,199
at a relationship so the first one is

43
00:03:03,049 --> 00:03:07,909
drought avoidance or escape a lot of

44
00:03:06,199 --> 00:03:09,469
times you think of the ephemeral growing

45
00:03:07,909 --> 00:03:12,469
in the desert doesn't weigh in the

46
00:03:09,469 --> 00:03:15,169
stadium but if the plant is able to grow

47
00:03:12,469 --> 00:03:18,729
in very cool season conditions and

48
00:03:15,169 --> 00:03:24,858
that's a way of weeding the midsummer

49
00:03:18,729 --> 00:03:28,099
condition another one is if they do have

50
00:03:24,859 --> 00:03:32,090
to grow through the summer you can try

51
00:03:28,099 --> 00:03:34,579
to maintain of the water potential at

52
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:37,159
the high met I let them so even though

53
00:03:34,579 --> 00:03:41,420
there is just you tolerate the drought

54
00:03:37,159 --> 00:03:43,609
by maintaining high water plant and

55
00:03:41,419 --> 00:03:47,858
that's usually through reduction of

56
00:03:43,609 --> 00:03:51,739
water loss the cuticles stomata behavior

57
00:03:47,859 --> 00:03:55,939
reduction of radiation for the natural

58
00:03:51,739 --> 00:03:58,280
leaf area of sorts of things and another

59
00:03:55,939 --> 00:04:01,099
aspect of maintaining the water is to

60
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:03,739
maintain the water uptake so either

61
00:04:01,099 --> 00:04:08,469
increase fruit density or finding more

62
00:04:03,739 --> 00:04:12,829
water and in or increase in conductivity

63
00:04:08,469 --> 00:04:15,530
conductivity to to give the water the

64
00:04:12,829 --> 00:04:18,079
water potential maintaining and of

65
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:20,269
course if it has to tolerate a more

66
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:23,168
severe drought then there's the

67
00:04:20,269 --> 00:04:26,540
mechanism such as automatic adjustment

68
00:04:23,168 --> 00:04:29,889
to maintain trigger

69
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:31,939
that cushion elasticity in size

70
00:04:29,889 --> 00:04:36,589
something that really hasn't been looked

71
00:04:31,939 --> 00:04:39,620
at with Apple so get into that part so

72
00:04:36,589 --> 00:04:44,419
let's look at some of these ways of

73
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:49,730
looking at them and their implications

74
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:52,699
for practical for the avoidance issues

75
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:54,910
both happen of Apple there tends to be

76
00:04:52,699 --> 00:05:01,279
two types of shoots although they're not

77
00:04:54,910 --> 00:05:03,980
strictly separated and that is that you

78
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:07,729
know mature plant we have these very

79
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:12,200
short shoots that produce of rosette of

80
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:16,790
leaves that's called the their bubble

81
00:05:12,199 --> 00:05:20,389
Spurs and the there's preformed leaves

82
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:24,350
within that bud and it's also the place

83
00:05:20,389 --> 00:05:27,589
that where the fruit flowers and fruit

84
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:29,800
are born and so these performance come

85
00:05:27,589 --> 00:05:33,979
out very quickly in the spring and

86
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:36,949
there's a single lateral shoots off of

87
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:39,610
that that can you've got mortared

88
00:05:36,949 --> 00:05:43,370
leaf area typically dia tends to produce

89
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:45,379
short shoot and so you get the rosette

90
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:49,100
with another short shoot on top of it

91
00:05:45,379 --> 00:05:52,279
and that makes guys for complex that you

92
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:54,770
see on the right so these come out very

93
00:05:52,279 --> 00:05:58,699
quickly in the spring and they can

94
00:05:54,769 --> 00:06:00,889
develop the very significant canopy and

95
00:05:58,699 --> 00:06:04,699
so at the bottom here you can see a

96
00:06:00,889 --> 00:06:08,000
cornfield in late May I don't know

97
00:06:04,699 --> 00:06:10,939
that's actually typical or they just

98
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,879
planted it but in late May this was a

99
00:06:10,939 --> 00:06:16,219
field that ended up being corn and then

100
00:06:13,879 --> 00:06:18,379
on the right you can see the canopy of

101
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:21,710
apples is is really going that low

102
00:06:18,379 --> 00:06:22,699
developed they begin growing fairly

103
00:06:21,709 --> 00:06:26,989
early mid-april

104
00:06:22,699 --> 00:06:36,079
so their conditions are quite cool to

105
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:39,199
run 12 and 4 Celsius and by by about 40

106
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:43,668
days 30 days or so

107
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:45,288
perhaps your butt break they big boom by

108
00:06:43,668 --> 00:06:47,389
that time you have something in the

109
00:06:45,288 --> 00:06:49,098
neighborhood of 20 to 30 percent of the

110
00:06:47,389 --> 00:06:52,879
week area that you're going to have

111
00:06:49,098 --> 00:06:55,399
maybe 40 you have 250 percent of the

112
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:59,689
light intercept so they have a very

113
00:06:55,399 --> 00:07:02,839
rapid canopy development they are able

114
00:06:59,689 --> 00:07:06,199
to develop a lot of that canopy and

115
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:12,369
productivity before we have significant

116
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:12,370
drop stress to mention also the

117
00:07:13,269 --> 00:07:23,899
temperature so when you have a very long

118
00:07:18,228 --> 00:07:32,959
growing season like in New Zealand or or

119
00:07:23,899 --> 00:07:34,998
their way they they may have fallen but

120
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:38,478
they can have very long growing seasons

121
00:07:34,999 --> 00:07:41,689
and the leaves will stay on if your

122
00:07:38,478 --> 00:07:44,418
weather stays stays good Nick and stay

123
00:07:41,689 --> 00:07:49,338
on for a long time so later they can be

124
00:07:44,418 --> 00:07:51,588
very productive as well so the other

125
00:07:49,338 --> 00:07:56,509
type of shoot are the extension students

126
00:07:51,588 --> 00:07:59,439
which are the ones that can grow out the

127
00:07:56,509 --> 00:08:03,348
winter note so the leaves are spaced out

128
00:07:59,439 --> 00:08:07,189
these can grow basically all season long

129
00:08:03,348 --> 00:08:11,528
and determinant shoot although equal set

130
00:08:07,189 --> 00:08:11,528
of mine but it's the weather conditions

131
00:08:21,788 --> 00:08:27,709
and then the weather conditions allow

132
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:30,758
and it's good water status it will

133
00:08:27,709 --> 00:08:33,799
continue to grow far into the season

134
00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:34,509
very often here we will see them stopped

135
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:39,918
growing

136
00:08:34,509 --> 00:08:42,318
basically by but they could grow some

137
00:08:39,918 --> 00:08:46,159
cases I've seen other Dibley they were

138
00:08:42,318 --> 00:08:48,588
actually growing into them so use that

139
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:51,379
flexibility but they can also stop very

140
00:08:48,589 --> 00:08:52,370
very quickly and they may not only grow

141
00:08:51,379 --> 00:08:54,289
just

142
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:57,200
you centimetres if you have the very

143
00:08:54,289 --> 00:09:00,730
drive early part of the season it's a

144
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:03,710
flexible response in terms of reducing

145
00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:09,500
potential knee area at least not

146
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:11,870
necessarily exercising these what are

147
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:15,679
the other things that they mentioned is

148
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:18,409
reduction in water loss the dimension

149
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:22,609
cuticle and apples we have a very affect

150
00:09:18,409 --> 00:09:25,219
you at all so that that's active that

151
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:28,190
the variable one obvious that's the

152
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:31,670
model behavior and this is something

153
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:33,080
that's fairly fairly unique without pain

154
00:09:31,669 --> 00:09:35,419
then is if you look at the

155
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:39,560
photosynthesis versus belief conductance

156
00:09:35,419 --> 00:09:44,419
and this is in in field trees normal

157
00:09:39,559 --> 00:09:47,479
summer conditions you don't see that

158
00:09:44,419 --> 00:09:50,149
type of hyperbolic curve that you might

159
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:52,850
expect with the opening of domains in

160
00:09:50,149 --> 00:09:56,079
photosynthesis we almost always find a

161
00:09:52,850 --> 00:10:00,740
very linear relationship between them

162
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:04,070
the snow makes seem to be very highly

163
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:06,950
coupled to the photosynthesis and so we

164
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:09,790
get a linear relationship and the other

165
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:13,700
thing we see is in a dumb open anymore

166
00:10:09,789 --> 00:10:17,708
then the photosynthesis continues right

167
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:20,240
and so in most cases you'll see the

168
00:10:17,708 --> 00:10:23,509
stomata conductors open more and more

169
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:28,039
focus and this is light goes out and so

170
00:10:23,509 --> 00:10:35,659
you'll see the will tail off on the on

171
00:10:28,039 --> 00:10:40,069
the right side we don't estimate those

172
00:10:35,659 --> 00:10:43,129
publications around 23% and they just

173
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:46,278
don't roll it up excessively under

174
00:10:43,129 --> 00:10:50,659
normal field conditions now this data

175
00:10:46,278 --> 00:10:53,299
actually is I get it

176
00:10:50,659 --> 00:10:56,120
this is the actual data from three

177
00:10:53,299 --> 00:10:58,189
different sets of measurements the pink

178
00:10:56,120 --> 00:11:04,279
squares are other controls they're

179
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:10,690
healthy water the green triangles are

180
00:11:04,279 --> 00:11:13,939
from consider water stress and the blue

181
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:17,570
symbols are from branches that we burn

182
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:20,930
on the branch to speak back in a vision

183
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:22,850
and shut down photosynthesis and yet

184
00:11:20,929 --> 00:11:26,449
they all fall in exactly the same

185
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:30,230
progression so we've learned that over

186
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:32,450
the years that that in the field we see

187
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:35,529
a very very strong coupling between them

188
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:40,400
the photosynthesis and the smaller

189
00:11:35,529 --> 00:11:42,169
behavior which is permanent you've done

190
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:50,179
that weed and the field almost never

191
00:11:42,169 --> 00:11:53,329
seemed very my Hou chu-u conditions what

192
00:11:50,179 --> 00:11:55,309
that's not true oh but I should an

193
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:59,000
intimate and the field what happens is

194
00:11:55,309 --> 00:12:01,939
that because it's basically linear you

195
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:05,419
get a you tend to have a very constant

196
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:08,780
yru sufficiency assuming you know at any

197
00:12:05,419 --> 00:12:10,939
pressure deficit because the you're

198
00:12:08,779 --> 00:12:14,029
opening up the snow mates at the same

199
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:16,610
rate synthesis is going out so what are

200
00:12:14,029 --> 00:12:20,569
you sufficiency across that ranges it's

201
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:22,550
really a quite constant we're in many

202
00:12:20,570 --> 00:12:24,790
cases there's nobody's open up too much

203
00:12:22,549 --> 00:12:30,379
and the photosynthesis doesn't increase

204
00:12:24,789 --> 00:12:33,199
you'll see a decline I am and so apples

205
00:12:30,379 --> 00:12:38,720
have a very very good water use

206
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:41,690
efficiency now I now just to reviewed

207
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:44,029
everything I said apples have an

208
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:48,440
interesting characteristic and that is

209
00:12:44,029 --> 00:12:52,850
that they if you look at the response to

210
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:55,010
BB D you see two different types of

211
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:58,480
responses under very low stress

212
00:12:55,009 --> 00:13:01,279
conditions so in many cases potted trees

213
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:04,460
or growing in very very low stress

214
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:08,659
conditions and things like that you'll

215
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:12,530
find that the stomata conductance at

216
00:13:08,659 --> 00:13:15,469
very humid conditions low BB D can go up

217
00:13:12,529 --> 00:13:15,870
very high this domain can open up very

218
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:19,290
much

219
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:23,669
but in the field we see the blue markers

220
00:13:19,289 --> 00:13:27,000
down below where they it will drop off

221
00:13:23,669 --> 00:13:32,189
at the high vvd but they really don't

222
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:34,350
respond to that that's a low BP be in

223
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:37,220
high humidity so they don't open up

224
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:39,330
nearly as much as they normally would

225
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:43,529
these days are actually from the same

226
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:48,570
branch on the same tree but three days

227
00:13:43,529 --> 00:13:51,299
apart if there is stress they will

228
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:53,820
behave like the blue markers where they

229
00:13:51,299 --> 00:13:56,309
they don't respond to humidity after

230
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:59,879
three days of very humid overcast

231
00:13:56,309 --> 00:14:01,589
drizzly conditions then the in the black

232
00:13:59,879 --> 00:14:04,500
markers show that they can open up

233
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:05,730
pretty widely under most stress and then

234
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:07,980
about two three days later

235
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:12,300
under normal conditions again they have

236
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:18,480
got that so it's not a set response it's

237
00:14:12,299 --> 00:14:24,750
a very dynamic response and so have some

238
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:28,590
thoughts on why that is so the some

239
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:30,960
unresponsive BB is quite unusual what we

240
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:34,290
think they were interpreting that is it

241
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:37,980
basically the Green Line just shows that

242
00:14:34,289 --> 00:14:41,009
there's a limit due to the humidity on

243
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:44,070
the opening of the domains perhaps a

244
00:14:41,009 --> 00:14:47,610
fillable transpiration that's

245
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:50,550
illuminating the opening line but in the

246
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:55,379
video we have a second response and that

247
00:14:50,549 --> 00:14:58,889
is a limitation imposed by the coupling

248
00:14:55,379 --> 00:15:06,000
of the photosynthesis so like I showed

249
00:14:58,889 --> 00:15:09,830
earlier the if we hurdle the huge and

250
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:13,590
the photosynthesis is dropped by 80%

251
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:15,450
this domain is closed so under those

252
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:17,850
conditions where you have low

253
00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:21,230
photosynthesis and could be due to like

254
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:24,210
a very little code get accumulation of

255
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:28,009
hydrates the photosynthesis goes down

256
00:15:24,210 --> 00:15:29,480
then you get almost no response at all

257
00:15:28,009 --> 00:15:33,889
so

258
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:36,529
in many cases you know we may see very

259
00:15:33,889 --> 00:15:48,830
young responsibly but we think there's

260
00:15:36,529 --> 00:15:50,949
two interacting this will now another

261
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:55,580
thing is the reduction of each area

262
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:59,030
apples don't really didn't really excise

263
00:15:55,580 --> 00:16:01,400
of if they don't drop the leaves like in

264
00:15:59,029 --> 00:16:07,579
most cases what it does is it stops

265
00:16:01,399 --> 00:16:09,230
producing new leaves and I you know stop

266
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:11,629
producing new leaves and retain old

267
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:13,279
leaves there's some real advantages in

268
00:16:11,629 --> 00:16:15,649
that you're not constantly having to

269
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:18,919
build new leaves so the respiration

270
00:16:15,649 --> 00:16:20,990
rates of apple trees we've used mold

271
00:16:18,919 --> 00:16:24,679
canopy balloons in the middle of summer

272
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:27,879
the respiration on a sunny day if it

273
00:16:24,679 --> 00:16:33,879
fixed a hundred grams of carbohydrates

274
00:16:27,879 --> 00:16:38,389
or co2 and I get may only respire five

275
00:16:33,879 --> 00:16:41,539
very very low respiration value because

276
00:16:38,389 --> 00:16:44,990
they're not producing a lot of new new

277
00:16:41,539 --> 00:16:47,539
tissue but to make that work those

278
00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:50,539
always have to be able to be productive

279
00:16:47,539 --> 00:16:55,009
for many many months and that is another

280
00:16:50,539 --> 00:16:58,129
unusual thing that Apple is that so this

281
00:16:55,009 --> 00:16:59,240
this plot shows the spur leaves we

282
00:16:58,129 --> 00:17:02,000
mentioned earlier they come out

283
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:04,160
beginning of the season they came out

284
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,170
and they were first measured and at the

285
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:10,130
end of April this is in Washington State

286
00:17:06,170 --> 00:17:12,019
and basically their photosynthesis rate

287
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:16,550
didn't change until the middle of

288
00:17:12,019 --> 00:17:19,400
October and if you go out at this time

289
00:17:16,549 --> 00:17:22,220
of year even to these walking shoes at

290
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:24,230
least every two days so they have

291
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:29,480
different ages they all will give the

292
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:32,839
same photosynthesis rate so they have a

293
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:36,440
very very slow turnover they can stay in

294
00:17:32,839 --> 00:17:38,029
almost complete dark two weeks take off

295
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:41,390
the shades and they'll still be green

296
00:17:38,029 --> 00:17:43,779
after a couple hours of acclamation

297
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:43,780
light

298
00:17:44,289 --> 00:17:52,930
so the leaves on the interior don't

299
00:17:47,809 --> 00:17:54,950
really fall off so it's a interesting

300
00:17:52,930 --> 00:18:03,310
combination between the water relations

301
00:17:54,950 --> 00:18:08,240
in okay in terms of the radiation

302
00:18:03,309 --> 00:18:09,710
absorbed relationship the leaf area as I

303
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:12,109
mentioned that leaves it doesn't

304
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:14,660
broccolis with one of the

305
00:18:12,109 --> 00:18:17,839
characteristics and it does do is it the

306
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:22,460
exterior leaves that are exposed to

307
00:18:17,839 --> 00:18:27,619
highlight fold and if they're exposed to

308
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:31,100
highlight and additional job stress they

309
00:18:27,619 --> 00:18:34,129
fold even more and I've seen some where

310
00:18:31,099 --> 00:18:37,309
the Argent almost touched they folded up

311
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:40,970
so much what this does is it reduces the

312
00:18:37,309 --> 00:18:42,289
turkey load on that individual lead but

313
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:45,230
of course those leaves that are having

314
00:18:42,289 --> 00:18:48,769
the full Sun normally so that they're

315
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:50,779
really not short of energy so they can

316
00:18:48,769 --> 00:18:53,000
still photosynthesize it pretty much the

317
00:18:50,779 --> 00:18:56,720
maximum rate but what it does is it

318
00:18:53,000 --> 00:19:00,890
allows light to be inter trading into

319
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:04,370
the canopy where the interior leaves are

320
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:06,560
flatter so the lower the light land of

321
00:19:04,369 --> 00:19:08,389
the leaf mix and of course they're going

322
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:11,720
to low light so the additional height

323
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:14,300
yet is used very efficient so it does

324
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:17,420
seem that it it should be increasing

325
00:19:14,299 --> 00:19:22,639
what are you sufficiency of the enemy so

326
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:27,400
not necessarily reducing the total

327
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:30,230
length intersection so Apple tends to

328
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:33,019
tend to be the type is not so

329
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:37,549
conservative because it retains those

330
00:19:33,019 --> 00:19:40,250
old leaves keep some of Trump and so and

331
00:19:37,549 --> 00:19:42,829
it doesn't broadly so doesn't really

332
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:46,269
reduce its water loss dramatically as

333
00:19:42,829 --> 00:19:51,019
any other plant with the shutdown and

334
00:19:46,269 --> 00:19:54,460
drop the leaves but it it sort of toughs

335
00:19:51,019 --> 00:19:58,299
out the moderate grounds so

336
00:19:54,460 --> 00:20:01,890
I know reported it said in really drying

337
00:19:58,299 --> 00:20:05,049
conditions apples are considered very

338
00:20:01,890 --> 00:20:08,620
drop sensitive because they can't make

339
00:20:05,049 --> 00:20:11,889
it through two or three months where

340
00:20:08,619 --> 00:20:14,379
other things like great will be very low

341
00:20:11,890 --> 00:20:16,990
just shut down drop leaves and we'll get

342
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:19,150
through the drought but in shorter

343
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:21,970
droughts they can stay more productive

344
00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:26,080
and so that seems to be their big

345
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:28,240
national can the other aspect that

346
00:20:26,079 --> 00:20:32,769
mentioned was making this water I take

347
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:35,529
my increase route connectivity or using

348
00:20:32,769 --> 00:20:38,410
the resistance of that root system well

349
00:20:35,529 --> 00:20:43,750
Apple root systems have a relatively

350
00:20:38,410 --> 00:20:47,250
high rolling resistance and flattened

351
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:51,400
they need to adjust that in the roots

352
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:55,089
study from her student Fred Davies where

353
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:58,240
we had potted apple trees for three year

354
00:20:55,089 --> 00:21:01,269
old trees that we kept in a very humid

355
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:03,220
glass house so very little member

356
00:21:01,269 --> 00:21:07,420
benanna conditions and we put half of

357
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:11,049
them out in a gravel area were much

358
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:14,350
hotter prior and and after several weeks

359
00:21:11,049 --> 00:21:16,269
that we then we noticed that when we

360
00:21:14,349 --> 00:21:19,509
took water potential readings of the

361
00:21:16,269 --> 00:21:21,940
leaves and in those two conditions they

362
00:21:19,509 --> 00:21:24,789
had the same value even though they were

363
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:28,769
under dramatically different conditions

364
00:21:24,789 --> 00:21:33,430
so we brought them together and the

365
00:21:28,769 --> 00:21:35,559
resistance of the top grooves and we

366
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:39,640
found that the times didn't really

367
00:21:35,559 --> 00:21:43,179
change there a garlic resistance but the

368
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:46,200
root changed by about sixty percent so

369
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:51,630
when it was out in the dry conditions

370
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:51,630
resistance decrease allowing a higher

371
00:21:52,319 --> 00:21:57,339
conductivity or though the water and

372
00:21:55,420 --> 00:22:00,490
actually maintained the water potential

373
00:21:57,339 --> 00:22:03,490
at the same value I think this is when I

374
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:07,390
talk to colleagues in Israel hi Reuben

375
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:10,000
all over wet water tree in the middle

376
00:22:07,390 --> 00:22:12,070
in the summer for them they all intended

377
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,230
to give about the same water potentials

378
00:22:12,069 --> 00:22:23,428
even though they're living in quite

379
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:26,230
traumatic this is a quite strong effect

380
00:22:23,429 --> 00:22:29,470
anatomically we are visually we could

381
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:34,170
not see the difference it wasn't a

382
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:34,170
matter of on growing a lot of young life

383
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:44,830
so we don't know exactly in terms of

384
00:22:42,269 --> 00:22:47,558
another way of maintaining sugar is

385
00:22:44,829 --> 00:22:54,099
osmotic adjustment and this is something

386
00:22:47,558 --> 00:22:58,019
that apples do we've found it two and a

387
00:22:54,099 --> 00:23:03,639
half negative Pascal's or 25 bars just

388
00:22:58,019 --> 00:23:06,879
in in a dry season it takes time it

389
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:09,309
takes another week to get 83 years like

390
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:12,790
that so it's kind of a long response but

391
00:23:09,308 --> 00:23:15,910
let me start looking at it we found it

392
00:23:12,789 --> 00:23:20,649
you look at my potential up a chute that

393
00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:24,220
mature leaves basically I'll have a

394
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:28,000
quite low osmotic potential but this

395
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:30,700
your tips have a much higher that's not

396
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,589
a got potential and over the season we

397
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:37,058
found that those chute tips did not

398
00:23:32,589 --> 00:23:41,199
change in their water potential so this

399
00:23:37,058 --> 00:23:43,960
makes the extension shoots that are

400
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:46,720
growing those tips don't automatically

401
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:49,480
adjust so they respond directly to the

402
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:54,160
change in the water potential with a

403
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:57,819
Ryan condition however the mature leaves

404
00:23:54,160 --> 00:24:01,058
do automatically addressed and so this

405
00:23:57,819 --> 00:24:04,058
allows them to maintain turgor over the

406
00:24:01,058 --> 00:24:09,069
season and so you can see the mature

407
00:24:04,058 --> 00:24:11,519
leaves are responding to the conditions

408
00:24:09,069 --> 00:24:17,279
where the grown shoot tips

409
00:24:11,519 --> 00:24:20,259
basically are not at all so that is

410
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:20,799
abusive work before the older leaves and

411
00:24:20,259 --> 00:24:23,529
keeps

412
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:25,329
keeps the turgor and the water status of

413
00:24:23,529 --> 00:24:28,119
the older dudes better so they can be

414
00:24:25,329 --> 00:24:30,879
productive first a minute on them being

415
00:24:28,119 --> 00:24:37,119
able to be productive on lost time so so

416
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:40,330
it's a mix of coherent picture damn this

417
00:24:37,119 --> 00:24:44,500
is a study from from England where they

418
00:24:40,329 --> 00:24:47,409
looked at trees and they found that on

419
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:56,049
the osmotic the solid lines are

420
00:24:47,410 --> 00:24:57,850
irrigated - non irrigated monstrous and

421
00:24:56,049 --> 00:25:02,259
you can see the osmotic potentials were

422
00:24:57,849 --> 00:25:05,339
literally high early and went down from

423
00:25:02,259 --> 00:25:07,990
about fifteen or sixteen thirty five

424
00:25:05,339 --> 00:25:14,558
extreme so about a twenty five justement

425
00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:17,049
there well the water potential was it's

426
00:25:14,558 --> 00:25:19,058
gradually going down also the different

427
00:25:17,049 --> 00:25:21,970
end is the trigger and you can see that

428
00:25:19,058 --> 00:25:24,279
basically over the season that the

429
00:25:21,970 --> 00:25:28,720
automatic adjustment was able to contain

430
00:25:24,279 --> 00:25:31,599
the trigger both for the inebriated ones

431
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:37,920
that went up and down but also for the

432
00:25:31,599 --> 00:25:43,509
stressed ones so the mic adjustment is a

433
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:49,058
is I think a very usable tool for the

434
00:25:43,509 --> 00:25:51,099
plant that has this type of we've

435
00:25:49,058 --> 00:25:54,369
mentioned the roots and the getting

436
00:25:51,099 --> 00:25:58,269
their hydraulic conductivity but apple

437
00:25:54,369 --> 00:26:00,729
roots especially in on earth orchards

438
00:25:58,269 --> 00:26:03,190
they're not growing on the seedlings in

439
00:26:00,730 --> 00:26:07,420
the big root systems are vultures are

440
00:26:03,190 --> 00:26:10,630
are using the worth stocks that keep the

441
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:14,950
plants maybe two meters or sometimes

442
00:26:10,630 --> 00:26:17,290
less in height and so they they have

443
00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:19,620
root systems that can see there's a

444
00:26:17,289 --> 00:26:24,279
picture can actually extend quite a ways

445
00:26:19,619 --> 00:26:26,649
but but they're not intensive so a lot

446
00:26:24,279 --> 00:26:29,918
of studies have been done that find that

447
00:26:26,650 --> 00:26:32,980
the movement density of apples varies

448
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:36,519
from zero but up to

449
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:39,839
25 or so on an average I've seen one

450
00:26:36,519 --> 00:26:43,659
flag seeing some values of a lot like 3

451
00:26:39,839 --> 00:26:45,250
where they've got some data from corner

452
00:26:43,659 --> 00:26:48,490
there's other plants even higher day

453
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:54,069
they can go up to 30 centimeters per

454
00:26:48,490 --> 00:26:57,069
cubic centimeter soil so the

455
00:26:54,069 --> 00:27:01,928
implications of this is one is it if you

456
00:26:57,069 --> 00:27:05,230
have one root growing up an apple and

457
00:27:01,929 --> 00:27:07,870
you have 100 groups a corner or a

458
00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:12,250
thousand roots of grass we're getting

459
00:27:07,869 --> 00:27:17,349
the same volume the grass is going to

460
00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:19,269
win and we see that if you have if you

461
00:27:17,349 --> 00:27:21,158
have a grass between the road you don't

462
00:27:19,269 --> 00:27:24,788
get a lot of that over it's roaming in

463
00:27:21,159 --> 00:27:30,610
that grass they tend to grow in the

464
00:27:24,788 --> 00:27:33,940
other areas and so that has a new

465
00:27:30,609 --> 00:27:38,168
patient for a practical growing and

466
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:42,009
Briggs words are very similar they will

467
00:27:38,169 --> 00:27:46,509
try to avoid the competition grasses and

468
00:27:42,009 --> 00:27:49,500
colors now because of the high hydraulic

469
00:27:46,509 --> 00:27:51,908
conductivity there's a very strong

470
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:55,380
relationship between wheat water

471
00:27:51,909 --> 00:27:59,620
potential laughs and the transpiration

472
00:27:55,380 --> 00:28:05,710
so the the intercept at 0 transpiration

473
00:27:59,619 --> 00:28:08,079
that basically on the plant so that can

474
00:28:05,710 --> 00:28:11,069
go up and down a few bars but the

475
00:28:08,079 --> 00:28:13,388
strongest effect is the transpiration

476
00:28:11,069 --> 00:28:17,200
because of that and on the right you can

477
00:28:13,388 --> 00:28:22,740
see there's a quite a strong diurnal

478
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:25,659
pattern in the water potential of the

479
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:29,798
apple trees and they'll go down to this

480
00:28:25,659 --> 00:28:32,769
is older data from Landsberg about 16 to

481
00:28:29,798 --> 00:28:35,918
20 bars and it's a well water it's not a

482
00:28:32,769 --> 00:28:39,788
that's not a problem for them because if

483
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:44,080
there was not an adjustment so we have

484
00:28:39,788 --> 00:28:45,169
this very strong diurnal pattern the

485
00:28:44,079 --> 00:28:48,568
other implication

486
00:28:45,169 --> 00:28:51,299
the root link density and this was

487
00:28:48,568 --> 00:28:58,699
calculated by Landsberg Jones from the

488
00:28:51,298 --> 00:29:03,479
earner is that as the soil dries out the

489
00:28:58,699 --> 00:29:06,568
rhizosphere resistance will tend to go

490
00:29:03,479 --> 00:29:11,869
up more rapidly with low room link

491
00:29:06,568 --> 00:29:16,368
density basically if you look at the

492
00:29:11,868 --> 00:29:18,958
estimates for old water use in the field

493
00:29:16,368 --> 00:29:23,818
estimates are something like you know we

494
00:29:18,959 --> 00:29:29,729
have at 80 maybe even 90% of grass uses

495
00:29:23,818 --> 00:29:31,979
so the percent of eto and so you haven't

496
00:29:29,729 --> 00:29:34,709
the apple trees are using almost the

497
00:29:31,979 --> 00:29:37,469
same amount of water as their grandmas

498
00:29:34,709 --> 00:29:41,788
but they're taking it up with maybe one

499
00:29:37,469 --> 00:29:43,649
100 or 500 this is mini roots so you've

500
00:29:41,788 --> 00:29:46,318
got very few roots they have to take up

501
00:29:43,648 --> 00:29:47,638
a lot of water and so in the middle of

502
00:29:46,318 --> 00:29:51,628
the day when they have a very high

503
00:29:47,638 --> 00:29:53,428
transpiration rate of their calculations

504
00:29:51,628 --> 00:29:56,038
suggest that there should be a

505
00:29:53,429 --> 00:30:00,019
significant localized drawing around the

506
00:29:56,038 --> 00:30:04,158
roots and I was actually some

507
00:30:00,019 --> 00:30:10,169
information data from Spain where they

508
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:13,769
around 150 percent of et and they they

509
00:30:10,169 --> 00:30:16,169
got increased growth and they have they

510
00:30:13,769 --> 00:30:19,348
had less negative in day one of the ten

511
00:30:16,169 --> 00:30:22,199
trees then if they just put on a hundred

512
00:30:19,348 --> 00:30:24,868
percent of B team at night before and

513
00:30:22,199 --> 00:30:28,318
though in the writers who depended only

514
00:30:24,868 --> 00:30:31,528
on the the hydraulic conductivity of

515
00:30:28,318 --> 00:30:34,019
soils would place that part so so we

516
00:30:31,528 --> 00:30:36,269
think because of that movement density

517
00:30:34,019 --> 00:30:39,598
that we're having a significant

518
00:30:36,269 --> 00:30:43,439
rhizosphere increase in resistance in

519
00:30:39,598 --> 00:30:49,288
the middle of the day and so it makes up

520
00:30:43,439 --> 00:30:52,889
these estimations you modeling that

521
00:30:49,288 --> 00:30:56,328
other component being variable as well

522
00:30:52,888 --> 00:30:56,328
as the plant itself

523
00:30:56,358 --> 00:31:00,538
now the

524
00:30:58,589 --> 00:31:03,720
another mention was some maintenance of

525
00:31:00,538 --> 00:31:08,538
water uptake by increased density or

526
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:11,460
death the results of this has been very

527
00:31:08,538 --> 00:31:15,109
really variable in some cases there has

528
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:20,610
been a little bit of increase as this

529
00:31:15,109 --> 00:31:23,879
job shows that the bottom line is checks

530
00:31:20,609 --> 00:31:27,629
and the other two are different stress

531
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:29,669
levels similar response when they did to

532
00:31:27,630 --> 00:31:33,360
have them somewhat less roots of the

533
00:31:29,669 --> 00:31:36,509
very top layers and then in the middle

534
00:31:33,359 --> 00:31:40,199
zone they had so got more roots and a

535
00:31:36,509 --> 00:31:43,019
lower to make much difference so they

536
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:47,909
didn't seem to be pushing deeper but

537
00:31:43,019 --> 00:31:51,960
they did test alone but other studies

538
00:31:47,909 --> 00:31:54,590
have found basically no response so that

539
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:58,890
doesn't seem to be a major major

540
00:31:54,589 --> 00:32:02,509
mechanism for Apple okay I talked about

541
00:31:58,890 --> 00:32:05,399
some of the the practical implications

542
00:32:02,509 --> 00:32:08,548
things like to me water use for

543
00:32:05,398 --> 00:32:11,879
irrigation or they might affect those

544
00:32:08,548 --> 00:32:18,179
things also how we actually go hearing

545
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:20,730
those we did work with students on Leon

546
00:32:18,179 --> 00:32:23,460
now these does he only do a summer

547
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:26,759
coming and that is when and typically

548
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:30,569
around the 1st of August or so you go

549
00:32:26,759 --> 00:32:35,369
out if you have a lot of canopy the

550
00:32:30,569 --> 00:32:38,189
after through the red ones need direct

551
00:32:35,369 --> 00:32:40,949
sunlight to get a good red color and so

552
00:32:38,190 --> 00:32:43,350
there may be too much shade and so the

553
00:32:40,950 --> 00:32:47,038
growers will go in and out long shoots

554
00:32:43,349 --> 00:32:49,949
with their own way and they quite a bit

555
00:32:47,038 --> 00:32:52,440
of leaf area actually estimated with

556
00:32:49,950 --> 00:32:54,659
although some growers they were doing

557
00:32:52,440 --> 00:33:01,200
some other severe or something they

558
00:32:54,659 --> 00:33:03,028
actually removed between 350 area and to

559
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:06,360
be able to fruit as well as supposed to

560
00:33:03,028 --> 00:33:08,089
possible and so we did take a look at

561
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:11,389
that using

562
00:33:08,089 --> 00:33:14,959
we'll canopy gas exchange systems that

563
00:33:11,390 --> 00:33:16,850
use for several studies and we found

564
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:20,990
that the canopy transpiration was

565
00:33:16,849 --> 00:33:23,299
reduced by by that summer pruning pretty

566
00:33:20,990 --> 00:33:27,230
much unfortunate for those the amount of

567
00:33:23,299 --> 00:33:30,889
big barrier removed not a wonder one the

568
00:33:27,230 --> 00:33:33,620
years and then after we did the summer

569
00:33:30,890 --> 00:33:36,650
pruning we looked at these stem water

570
00:33:33,619 --> 00:33:39,529
potentials the first columns on the left

571
00:33:36,650 --> 00:33:44,690
were just before the summer pruning nice

572
00:33:39,529 --> 00:33:46,759
sunny day and the skimmer potential see

573
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:48,500
they were basically the same and then

574
00:33:46,759 --> 00:33:50,750
later in the day after the summer

575
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:56,089
pruning we did it again and found about

576
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:59,420
a three bar adjustment of redemption in

577
00:33:56,089 --> 00:34:00,859
the in their level distress slight

578
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:03,320
difference so you can see that there was

579
00:34:00,859 --> 00:34:08,000
a difference caused by advance and about

580
00:34:03,319 --> 00:34:12,529
a week later spill there so in some ways

581
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:16,699
this make you the opportunity to to try

582
00:34:12,530 --> 00:34:20,480
to reduce somewhat the stress on the on

583
00:34:16,699 --> 00:34:22,429
the fruit it's kind of a compromise

584
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:24,230
though if you have a heavy crop you

585
00:34:22,429 --> 00:34:27,139
don't want to take up too much area or

586
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:30,730
you want a good size but if you have a

587
00:34:27,139 --> 00:34:33,980
lower crop it's not limited by the

588
00:34:30,730 --> 00:34:39,920
variances producing this may be an

589
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:42,800
opportunity to be game but usually not

590
00:34:39,920 --> 00:35:00,500
used for that purpose but we have seen

591
00:34:42,800 --> 00:35:03,019
in the in many cases one or two to

592
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:06,320
understand how much water being used to

593
00:35:03,019 --> 00:35:10,400
diet irrigation for our growers and in

594
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:13,600
some ways we found that it seemed like

595
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:17,030
we were irrigating or than we did and so

596
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:19,630
the real question of how do you estimate

597
00:35:17,030 --> 00:35:22,329
the water use apples in our

598
00:35:19,630 --> 00:35:24,818
like that because we're not in

599
00:35:22,329 --> 00:35:29,619
California Washington where where they

600
00:35:24,818 --> 00:35:32,349
develop the business and of course it's

601
00:35:29,619 --> 00:35:35,259
hard to estimate that from soil moisture

602
00:35:32,349 --> 00:35:39,099
because of the variable distributions of

603
00:35:35,259 --> 00:35:42,400
the cover crops so we wanted to try to

604
00:35:39,099 --> 00:35:45,609
understand how to do that and of course

605
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:50,588
the general approach using use of that

606
00:35:45,608 --> 00:35:53,828
equation and for agricultural crops

607
00:35:50,588 --> 00:36:03,038
usually the approach is to have a

608
00:35:53,829 --> 00:36:06,548
reference plant faster and use the model

609
00:36:03,039 --> 00:36:09,519
of MIT for that reference and then your

610
00:36:06,548 --> 00:36:12,730
crop is as a fraction of that

611
00:36:09,518 --> 00:36:17,679
so the that's the coefficient or kc is

612
00:36:12,730 --> 00:36:21,009
the fraction it works okay in places

613
00:36:17,679 --> 00:36:23,828
like california and it works okay when

614
00:36:21,009 --> 00:36:27,068
we have days that are like California

615
00:36:23,829 --> 00:36:31,599
but it doesn't seem to work very well in

616
00:36:27,068 --> 00:36:36,880
in New York and so basically shockingly

617
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:38,349
a grass is not a very good model now so

618
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:41,289
we thought what we need to take a look

619
00:36:38,349 --> 00:36:43,740
at this a little bit more detail

620
00:36:41,289 --> 00:36:47,769
we found that we're over irrigating in

621
00:36:43,739 --> 00:36:49,929
using that provision approach from arid

622
00:36:47,768 --> 00:36:53,709
zones now we are over your gating in

623
00:36:49,929 --> 00:36:58,558
cool years and the turns out that Ichigo

624
00:36:53,710 --> 00:37:02,889
is very very strongly and then radiation

625
00:36:58,559 --> 00:37:06,700
you look at the eto and begins radiation

626
00:37:02,889 --> 00:37:08,588
is 93 something like that so it doesn't

627
00:37:06,699 --> 00:37:15,879
have a very strong response to

628
00:37:08,588 --> 00:37:18,429
temperature humidity but in cases where

629
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:22,778
we would have very cool humid conditions

630
00:37:18,429 --> 00:37:27,129
but sunny we get a high eto but we get

631
00:37:22,778 --> 00:37:30,039
lower water use and so we realize that

632
00:37:27,130 --> 00:37:33,460
with tall brush structures that we

633
00:37:30,039 --> 00:37:37,940
needed to look into how are they

634
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:39,500
responding to the fire house that there

635
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:42,019
was some theoretical study that

636
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:43,818
suggested the coefficients that are

637
00:37:42,019 --> 00:37:48,349
developing arid zones may not work

638
00:37:43,818 --> 00:37:50,809
correctly in humans homes so if you look

639
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:53,890
at an orchard and with the grass in

640
00:37:50,809 --> 00:37:56,588
between you can see that for the grass

641
00:37:53,889 --> 00:37:58,279
below there's a heavy boundary layer

642
00:37:56,588 --> 00:38:01,309
especially in orchards and vineyards

643
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:04,339
where you have a windbreak every three

644
00:38:01,309 --> 00:38:06,529
meters or so so what happens is that you

645
00:38:04,338 --> 00:38:09,710
have a boundary layer that basically

646
00:38:06,530 --> 00:38:13,579
when the humidity comes out of the plant

647
00:38:09,710 --> 00:38:17,030
and tomato event it basically tracks

648
00:38:13,579 --> 00:38:19,609
that humidity so the snow is open the

649
00:38:17,030 --> 00:38:22,069
beef even from them so they basically

650
00:38:19,608 --> 00:38:26,659
cancel each other out and that's why

651
00:38:22,068 --> 00:38:31,009
there's pretty much just that's not the

652
00:38:26,659 --> 00:38:33,259
case with the apple tree because of the

653
00:38:31,010 --> 00:38:37,160
rough structure there's very very good

654
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:38,960
air flow around the around the leaves so

655
00:38:37,159 --> 00:38:41,960
if any humidity comes out of leave is

656
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:44,210
immediately mix with the bulk air so

657
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:48,079
then these two model opening makes a

658
00:38:44,210 --> 00:38:51,199
difference and the radiation makes it is

659
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:53,568
the energy occurs and the inherent BBD

660
00:38:51,199 --> 00:38:55,578
in the bulk air exiting difference so

661
00:38:53,568 --> 00:39:00,050
the two systems are being controlled by

662
00:38:55,579 --> 00:39:03,230
a different combination factors so we

663
00:39:00,050 --> 00:39:05,030
wanted to actually go take a look but we

664
00:39:03,230 --> 00:39:07,250
wanted to be able to measure it directly

665
00:39:05,030 --> 00:39:10,910
we use sap flow gauges but we didn't

666
00:39:07,250 --> 00:39:15,079
trust them to make all the estimations

667
00:39:10,909 --> 00:39:20,000
of wound factors so our student danila

668
00:39:15,079 --> 00:39:22,550
agrimony did a study with using sap

669
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:24,769
flows ages from we installed them and

670
00:39:22,550 --> 00:39:27,829
then we calibrated them with the whole

671
00:39:24,769 --> 00:39:31,150
canopy guest for several days and then

672
00:39:27,829 --> 00:39:32,318
remove the gas exchange fevers and

673
00:39:31,150 --> 00:39:35,720
[Music]

674
00:39:32,318 --> 00:39:39,199
calibrating xi o we recalibrated later

675
00:39:35,719 --> 00:39:41,838
in season so this way we could get a

676
00:39:39,199 --> 00:39:46,629
really direct measurement accurate

677
00:39:41,838 --> 00:39:46,630
measurement without disturbing

678
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:52,250
so we did that we found this is the

679
00:39:50,059 --> 00:39:55,460
action the actual prop coefficient is a

680
00:39:52,250 --> 00:39:57,679
fraction of eto during this type of a

681
00:39:55,460 --> 00:40:01,519
season it should be something like

682
00:39:57,679 --> 00:40:04,210
constant 0.8 you can see that's not

683
00:40:01,519 --> 00:40:08,599
really not true there are some days

684
00:40:04,210 --> 00:40:11,000
appeared that we're not dry and nice and

685
00:40:08,599 --> 00:40:13,400
there were some days that were cool and

686
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:19,130
he'd been that's funny so they had high

687
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:22,160
eto but low end up trees so in this case

688
00:40:19,130 --> 00:40:26,930
we could see that we really couldn't use

689
00:40:22,159 --> 00:40:30,529
the coefficients from arid climates and

690
00:40:26,929 --> 00:40:33,889
so we developed our own apple specific

691
00:40:30,530 --> 00:40:36,220
penalty operations and so for Fanta

692
00:40:33,889 --> 00:40:40,509
changed the for the boundary layer and

693
00:40:36,219 --> 00:40:45,219
other factors but we did use this unique

694
00:40:40,510 --> 00:40:47,750
stomata conductance weird in terms of

695
00:40:45,219 --> 00:40:51,889
conductors versus the amount of demand

696
00:40:47,750 --> 00:40:55,550
epp it goes down with the very dry

697
00:40:51,889 --> 00:40:58,819
conditions but it plants out and the

698
00:40:55,550 --> 00:41:01,880
more moderate human conditions so we

699
00:40:58,820 --> 00:41:07,250
could not make the measured data model

700
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:13,490
until we put that relationship in there

701
00:41:07,250 --> 00:41:18,829
and then we did get a so this model then

702
00:41:13,489 --> 00:41:23,079
was put on to the website in the climate

703
00:41:18,829 --> 00:41:25,519
center with art and peed-on and

704
00:41:23,079 --> 00:41:27,980
calculates water balance for the growers

705
00:41:25,519 --> 00:41:30,159
using the data from the new global

706
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:37,849
weather stations

707
00:41:30,159 --> 00:41:41,029
he's always we mentioned that water

708
00:41:37,849 --> 00:41:44,150
status strongly affects many factors

709
00:41:41,030 --> 00:41:48,109
obviously we use for synthesis but it

710
00:41:44,150 --> 00:41:51,050
also reduces as you both rate and as we

711
00:41:48,108 --> 00:41:55,699
have mined from the the lack of

712
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:57,950
adjustment the the shoe tips the growth

713
00:41:55,699 --> 00:42:02,029
rate is pretty much

714
00:41:57,949 --> 00:42:05,230
reduced by stress case we use stem wire

715
00:42:02,030 --> 00:42:08,300
potential as the best integrated

716
00:42:05,230 --> 00:42:10,760
measurement and then also root growth

717
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:18,289
rate through tends to have a little bit

718
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:20,720
of what should be a stress so these have

719
00:42:18,289 --> 00:42:27,279
a very strong effect watch this and as

720
00:42:20,719 --> 00:42:30,919
this growth canopy and of the food so

721
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:33,200
really how we deal with that variability

722
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:36,380
there we talk about because there's a

723
00:42:33,199 --> 00:42:42,169
strong transpiration effect and we shown

724
00:42:36,380 --> 00:42:44,690
the soil variation and can cause some

725
00:42:42,170 --> 00:42:47,809
variation there but the weather patterns

726
00:42:44,690 --> 00:42:50,119
have a big effect on the transpiration

727
00:42:47,809 --> 00:42:54,500
so it means if there's temporal

728
00:42:50,119 --> 00:42:56,630
variation going on very dynamic and

729
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:59,409
depending on the winter our crazy

730
00:42:56,630 --> 00:43:02,930
weather you can imagine a variable it is

731
00:42:59,409 --> 00:43:06,440
spatial also any orchards you're not in

732
00:43:02,929 --> 00:43:11,358
the most uniform soil some are but the

733
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:13,820
may be on hills or you have in areas

734
00:43:11,358 --> 00:43:16,250
where you get spatial variation soils

735
00:43:13,820 --> 00:43:20,090
and then there's a lot of physiologic

736
00:43:16,250 --> 00:43:21,980
development so trying to model all that

737
00:43:20,090 --> 00:43:24,710
to estimate what the actual water

738
00:43:21,980 --> 00:43:27,889
suppress is in the plant is something

739
00:43:24,710 --> 00:43:30,400
that's really very difficult and it's

740
00:43:27,889 --> 00:43:34,969
obviously best just right

741
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:38,059
and so since to mention the water status

742
00:43:34,969 --> 00:43:40,819
of the plant depends on so many of these

743
00:43:38,059 --> 00:43:43,130
factors all these parameters and

744
00:43:40,820 --> 00:43:47,200
treatments so a lot of availability

745
00:43:43,130 --> 00:43:49,789
where the roots are water is but the

746
00:43:47,199 --> 00:43:53,059
sort of water content versus water

747
00:43:49,789 --> 00:43:54,679
potential these curves looks like so

748
00:43:53,059 --> 00:43:58,190
there's so many different things why not

749
00:43:54,679 --> 00:44:00,349
just an injury and so of course we we

750
00:43:58,190 --> 00:44:03,679
have done that for many many years using

751
00:44:00,349 --> 00:44:07,339
the scroll under pressure chamber or

752
00:44:03,679 --> 00:44:10,419
called the pressure bond it's manual

753
00:44:07,340 --> 00:44:13,789
that's accurate you get good

754
00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:17,349
but it's very slow very limited data

755
00:44:13,789 --> 00:44:20,840
because the name of nature there can be

756
00:44:17,349 --> 00:44:26,929
significant career area and it can lead

757
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:32,900
to operate a team if you can see lumbar

758
00:44:26,929 --> 00:44:35,389
or four five and take take a hit so in

759
00:44:32,900 --> 00:44:39,349
this this case you know after doing this

760
00:44:35,389 --> 00:44:41,659
from two leaders or thirty of the time I

761
00:44:39,349 --> 00:44:45,230
said well we've got to come up with some

762
00:44:41,659 --> 00:44:48,710
we got to somehow get this pressure bump

763
00:44:45,230 --> 00:44:51,019
thing into a some type of sensor that we

764
00:44:48,710 --> 00:44:55,300
could stick inside the plan and get

765
00:44:51,019 --> 00:44:55,300
continuous reading that we can sit back

766
00:44:55,449 --> 00:45:02,359
so contacted the age group in

767
00:44:59,980 --> 00:45:07,550
engineering who's working on physics of

768
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:10,099
water plants and we thought well the

769
00:45:07,550 --> 00:45:13,760
conventional Scott litter has a very

770
00:45:10,099 --> 00:45:16,400
good basic physical principle and so if

771
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:19,430
we could just turn that big one into a

772
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:21,530
little children that we could make a

773
00:45:19,429 --> 00:45:24,589
micro version of that to be able to

774
00:45:21,530 --> 00:45:27,769
insert it into the trunk or using the

775
00:45:24,590 --> 00:45:36,559
soil and then be able to get in at my

776
00:45:27,769 --> 00:45:42,110
hand so that was the this is aim and the

777
00:45:36,559 --> 00:45:44,179
name okay remember was a grad student he

778
00:45:42,110 --> 00:45:46,550
was the first one to work with us on a

779
00:45:44,179 --> 00:45:50,210
joint horticultural can engineering

780
00:45:46,550 --> 00:45:54,980
student and he was followed up that tree

781
00:45:50,210 --> 00:46:00,280
event Lady Gaga who developed it further

782
00:45:54,980 --> 00:46:00,280
as a practical tool and see you jus

783
00:46:02,380 --> 00:46:07,910
Apple and also in the corn so we're

784
00:46:05,809 --> 00:46:11,599
interested in seeing how that works

785
00:46:07,909 --> 00:46:15,710
so the the center itself is a sandwich

786
00:46:11,599 --> 00:46:20,719
they say there's a quarter is a quarter

787
00:46:15,710 --> 00:46:23,329
in there but tiny I ate Anna leaders and

788
00:46:20,719 --> 00:46:26,899
in there so pressure transducer to

789
00:46:23,329 --> 00:46:29,780
measure the change in pressure and then

790
00:46:26,900 --> 00:46:32,660
there's an exchange surface that you can

791
00:46:29,780 --> 00:46:36,920
see on the right which is a silicon with

792
00:46:32,659 --> 00:46:39,440
denim denim Peter Tatchell Forge and

793
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:42,230
because of that we have a very very

794
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:44,720
large range normal tens you don't learn

795
00:46:42,230 --> 00:46:48,619
about one bar or less hours we'll go

796
00:46:44,719 --> 00:46:52,098
that one go through them but a hundred

797
00:46:48,619 --> 00:46:55,068
is sort of learn so we get a huge range

798
00:46:52,099 --> 00:46:57,670
and then the chip is mounted into a

799
00:46:55,068 --> 00:47:02,389
cylindrical probe you can see there next

800
00:46:57,670 --> 00:47:04,460
with the chip on the side and the this

801
00:47:02,389 --> 00:47:06,230
shows a little bit a bit easier in the

802
00:47:04,460 --> 00:47:10,400
top left you can see their children

803
00:47:06,230 --> 00:47:15,460
Educare we drill a hole with a guide and

804
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:15,460
a special and Bill bit to give a flat

805
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:24,579
work this is a prototype of we hold it

806
00:47:19,809 --> 00:47:29,630
to the tree but there's the developer

807
00:47:24,579 --> 00:47:34,068
and some nice ways of installing it and

808
00:47:29,630 --> 00:47:38,119
so this is studies from a couple years

809
00:47:34,068 --> 00:47:40,969
ago when we had a drought and you can

810
00:47:38,119 --> 00:47:43,099
see that the sensor is in the apple tree

811
00:47:40,969 --> 00:47:45,909
that's that's before all the insulation

812
00:47:43,099 --> 00:47:51,410
we have to do an installation over that

813
00:47:45,909 --> 00:47:55,460
but on a cloudy day you can see the red

814
00:47:51,409 --> 00:47:59,649
line is the radiation and the stem water

815
00:47:55,460 --> 00:48:02,059
potential is offered a little bit by the

816
00:47:59,650 --> 00:48:04,519
response time of the sensor that a lot

817
00:48:02,059 --> 00:48:10,818
seems to be a lot by the tree himself

818
00:48:04,519 --> 00:48:14,690
there's a students and so you can see

819
00:48:10,818 --> 00:48:18,730
the type of data they gathered it does

820
00:48:14,690 --> 00:48:22,068
correlate well with the pressure bottom

821
00:48:18,730 --> 00:48:26,539
except occasionally we'll get a early

822
00:48:22,068 --> 00:48:32,289
morning they'll be kind of a spike sap

823
00:48:26,539 --> 00:48:34,489
flow agency that we and so they just

824
00:48:32,289 --> 00:48:38,269
might do to achieve

825
00:48:34,489 --> 00:48:43,309
changes in temperature so we have to we

826
00:48:38,269 --> 00:48:46,369
do have a temperature sensor so we

827
00:48:43,309 --> 00:48:50,659
actually have that now this is the study

828
00:48:46,369 --> 00:48:55,850
that Cu has done with an apple trees and

829
00:48:50,659 --> 00:48:58,809
you can see the diagonal pattern blue

830
00:48:55,849 --> 00:49:03,380
line and then the pressure bond values

831
00:48:58,809 --> 00:49:08,539
box so it really is is looking like

832
00:49:03,380 --> 00:49:12,559
dreams coming true and we do to get this

833
00:49:08,539 --> 00:49:14,739
actually available to growers no big its

834
00:49:12,559 --> 00:49:18,559
own it's a micro electromechanical

835
00:49:14,739 --> 00:49:20,299
system games would you it's not

836
00:49:18,559 --> 00:49:23,239
something that most history and

837
00:49:20,300 --> 00:49:27,830
companies do the people that do it are

838
00:49:23,239 --> 00:49:32,989
interested in this application so I was

839
00:49:27,829 --> 00:49:37,309
a small startup and I hope Yago is late

840
00:49:32,989 --> 00:49:39,858
on that even but they're making a lot of

841
00:49:37,309 --> 00:49:43,608
really good progress I'm getting that

842
00:49:39,858 --> 00:49:46,608
available under the first sales that

843
00:49:43,608 --> 00:49:52,009
would be next year on it so we're

844
00:49:46,608 --> 00:49:53,480
getting pretty excited about it and of

845
00:49:52,010 --> 00:49:55,820
course I like to acknowledge got a lot

846
00:49:53,480 --> 00:50:01,460
of the people especially that terms

847
00:49:55,820 --> 00:50:04,910
Robinson for 35 years now there's a lot

848
00:50:01,460 --> 00:50:09,289
of work would be radiation or taken to

849
00:50:04,909 --> 00:50:11,329
the field and technicians graduate

850
00:50:09,289 --> 00:50:14,329
students is not put them all out there

851
00:50:11,329 --> 00:50:17,420
and some of the different sources of

852
00:50:14,329 --> 00:50:19,759
funding but I really have to make a

853
00:50:17,420 --> 00:50:23,780
pitch for hatch yes

854
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:28,070
basic state plans because nobody wants

855
00:50:23,780 --> 00:50:32,210
to pay for water relations studies in

856
00:50:28,070 --> 00:50:36,200
this kind of planner they even say a new

857
00:50:32,210 --> 00:50:38,990
study learning relations I said well in

858
00:50:36,199 --> 00:50:42,379
California on the irrigate they never

859
00:50:38,989 --> 00:50:46,949
have because it's always the other water

860
00:50:42,380 --> 00:50:49,530
they need here if we don't have rain

861
00:50:46,949 --> 00:50:51,929
stress so we have a lot more conscious

862
00:50:49,530 --> 00:50:55,829
than they do what places they are you

863
00:50:51,929 --> 00:50:58,739
know so okay so I think over the years

864
00:50:55,829 --> 00:51:02,640
it's extremely interesting but there's

865
00:50:58,739 --> 00:51:04,429
actually useful things this type of

866
00:51:02,639 --> 00:51:08,150
study

867
00:51:04,429 --> 00:51:08,149
thank you through danger

868
00:51:10,519 --> 00:51:19,159
this has been a production of Cornell

869
00:51:13,588 --> 00:51:19,159
