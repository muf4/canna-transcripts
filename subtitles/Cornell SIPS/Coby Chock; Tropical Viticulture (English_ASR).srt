1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:04,280
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:06,878 --> 00:00:11,079
University okay I'd like to introduce

3
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:13,798
Marvin who's gonna say a few words about

4
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:15,440
the Dreer award one of one of the

5
00:00:13,798 --> 00:00:17,399
wonderful things about Cornell is there

6
00:00:15,439 --> 00:00:19,118
these pockets of money around and people

7
00:00:17,399 --> 00:00:21,118
don't often know about it there's a

8
00:00:19,118 --> 00:00:23,759
pretty big pocket of money called the

9
00:00:21,118 --> 00:00:26,079
jur word that's was set up to allow

10
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,039
graduate students to travel somewhere

11
00:00:26,079 --> 00:00:30,479
internationally to supplement their

12
00:00:28,039 --> 00:00:34,920
career or their research or whatever

13
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:37,558
and uh it's about $28,000 a year and

14
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:40,200
sometime in March April we invite

15
00:00:37,558 --> 00:00:42,558
graduate students to submit a proposal

16
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:44,000
it's very honorous they have to submit

17
00:00:42,558 --> 00:00:45,479
five or six pages of what they want to

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,280
do they have to meet with the committee

19
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:48,718
of three for like 20 minutes and explain

20
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,920
what they're going to do and then we

21
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:53,640
make a decision it's the easiest money

22
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:55,198
you would ever get the only requirement

23
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:56,679
is after you travel and you do you say

24
00:00:55,198 --> 00:00:58,920
you come back and give a seminar to all

25
00:00:56,679 --> 00:01:01,359
of us it's open to landscape

26
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:03,960
architecture and what graduate students

27
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:06,040
and our speaker today was the recipient

28
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:08,439
of the jur award so let Justine

29
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:10,439
introduce all right I'll come up to the

30
00:01:08,438 --> 00:01:13,319
microphone just so online folks can hear

31
00:01:10,438 --> 00:01:15,438
me hello everyone my name is Justine

32
00:01:13,319 --> 00:01:18,879
Vanden hubal I'm a professor of

33
00:01:15,438 --> 00:01:21,959
viticulture uh in sips and I'm pleased

34
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:24,640
to be here to introduce Kobe chalk so

35
00:01:21,959 --> 00:01:28,399
Kobe's undergrad is from the University

36
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:30,879
of Hawaii at the Noah uh and he grew up

37
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:33,240
in Hawaii he did spend a semester at

38
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:35,759
University of Massachusetts ammer where

39
00:01:33,239 --> 00:01:39,118
he actually took his first vulture

40
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:40,719
course his background is in economics

41
00:01:39,118 --> 00:01:44,000
and when he was here we actually

42
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:46,879
combined that he did a cost analysis of

43
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,359
a spatial sampling protocol that uh we

44
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:51,359
had designed and that paper was recently

45
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:54,519
published in the American Journal of

46
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:56,920
knowledge a knowledge and vulture so I'm

47
00:01:54,519 --> 00:01:59,640
very proud of uh the work that he's done

48
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:02,960
here it's been a pleasure to have him in

49
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:05,640
my that I'm glad he has kept up uh the

50
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:07,799
long line of my students who have then

51
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:10,520
gotten the drewer and gone off and done

52
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:12,079
amazing uh things around the country so

53
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:14,680
we're thrilled to have him here welcome

54
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:17,760
Kobe nice to have you back thank you

55
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:20,159
Justine um so first I'd like to thank

56
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:23,679
Justine and thank the Jer committee as

57
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:25,919
well as all of the people who made it

58
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:28,719
possible for me to go and learn all the

59
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:30,359
things that I did abroad um so as you

60
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:32,680
can see my presentation today is going

61
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:35,480
to be covering tropical viticulture it's

62
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:38,200
something that's a little different than

63
00:02:35,479 --> 00:02:41,199
standard wine making and standard

64
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:42,719
viticulture and the reason I'm

65
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:44,878
interested is as Justin mentioned I'm

66
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:48,239
from Hawaii and down the road I plan on

67
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:49,759
starting a Vineyard and Winery and

68
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:52,959
Hawaii

69
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:56,799
so we get

70
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:58,719
started so this picture here is of me at

71
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:01,760
the vineyard I was interning at in

72
00:02:58,719 --> 00:03:05,519
Thailand in the kaay region so the

73
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:08,598
regions that I visited is in Thailand

74
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:08,599
Brazil and India

75
00:03:08,759 --> 00:03:13,519
particularly in Thailand it was in the

76
00:03:10,759 --> 00:03:16,120
Kaa area as I mentioned previously the

77
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:20,200
winery I had is Grand Monte Vineyard and

78
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:21,480
Winery this region up here is further

79
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:23,839
north than some of the other regions

80
00:03:21,479 --> 00:03:26,238
that also have Vineyards and

81
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:29,080
wineries um however the largest

82
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:30,400
concentration of wineries were located

83
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:34,040
in this region

84
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:37,599
right here um generally Thailand has two

85
00:03:34,039 --> 00:03:40,560
significant Seasons that are pretty

86
00:03:37,598 --> 00:03:43,158
consistent every year they have a winter

87
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:45,158
and then a summer and in the

88
00:03:43,158 --> 00:03:47,039
winter I'm sorry they have a mansu

89
00:03:45,158 --> 00:03:48,798
season and then a dry season so the

90
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:51,959
monsoon season as you can imagine is

91
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:55,280
very wet they don't propagate uh or grow

92
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:58,120
any Vines grapes that year uh that part

93
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:00,400
of the year and in that time they just

94
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:03,079
pretty much uh

95
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,400
prune and expect vegetative growth they

96
00:04:03,079 --> 00:04:07,439
don't want any grapes because even if

97
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:09,079
they had grapes it would be swelled with

98
00:04:07,438 --> 00:04:10,840
water they would get a lot of diseases

99
00:04:09,079 --> 00:04:12,920
and it's just not worth producing any

100
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:15,400
grapes during that time period uh

101
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:18,399
further down south in this area there's

102
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:20,439
another Vineyard that's a little warmer

103
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:23,359
the vineyard also has a monsoon season

104
00:04:20,439 --> 00:04:26,240
so they also don't go and have two

105
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:28,800
yields per year um but they're sand they

106
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,319
have a lot more sandy soil and then to

107
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,759
this region on the right

108
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:35,079
there is one Vineyard that actually

109
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:38,038
closed um so they're no longer there but

110
00:04:35,079 --> 00:04:39,758
this region was closer to uh the region

111
00:04:38,038 --> 00:04:41,639
the

112
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:43,520
Southwest the second region that I

113
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:47,439
visited is in petrolina

114
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:51,038
Brazil in petrolina it is described as

115
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:53,719
semi arid it is very dry for the most

116
00:04:51,038 --> 00:04:55,599
part when I was there they said that it

117
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:58,560
was actually the wetest they had been in

118
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:01,039
10 years once in every 10 years they get

119
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:04,639
a lot of rain and it was flooding but

120
00:05:01,038 --> 00:05:09,240
it's so rare that they can continuously

121
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:11,639
Harvest 365 days a year uh

122
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:14,519
perpetually and it's one of the most

123
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:17,038
unique regions that I visited for that

124
00:05:14,519 --> 00:05:20,399
reason um a little further south in

125
00:05:17,038 --> 00:05:23,399
Brazil as more of you are familiar with

126
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:26,599
is Sal Paulo where they have other

127
00:05:23,399 --> 00:05:28,399
Vineyards in three different regions um

128
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:30,960
appear a little bit to the north of

129
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:33,918
saelo a little bit further south and

130
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:35,638
then to the west of sou poo and this is

131
00:05:33,918 --> 00:05:39,159
a little bit closer to the traditional

132
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:42,038
30 to 50 latitude that you'd expect wine

133
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:45,840
to be grown in but

134
00:05:42,038 --> 00:05:47,800
um they grow it here and it's pretty

135
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:50,198
unique as well and the last place I

136
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:54,840
visited was in India it was in the

137
00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:58,080
nashik region and in the nashik region

138
00:05:54,839 --> 00:06:00,279
it is also pretty dry and arid um it can

139
00:05:58,079 --> 00:06:03,000
be I would say a little bit cooler than

140
00:06:00,279 --> 00:06:04,679
a lot of the other regions I visited um

141
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,079
but it's still within the tropics unlike

142
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:10,038
if you went to further south in India it

143
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:12,519
would be in the traditional latitude as

144
00:06:10,038 --> 00:06:14,519
well so I'm going to go through instead

145
00:06:12,519 --> 00:06:16,079
of describing each place that I visited

146
00:06:14,519 --> 00:06:18,359
just the vineyard management practices

147
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:23,959
and we can kind of see how things were

148
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:27,280
different or similar so uh this is Vine

149
00:06:23,959 --> 00:06:30,719
propagation as you can imagine because

150
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:33,359
Vineyards aren't as common in these

151
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:35,560
regions they don't really have a large

152
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:39,680
supply of vines a lot of the vines that

153
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:42,439
they do have were all imported in small

154
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:44,038
shipments and then it was grown based

155
00:06:42,439 --> 00:06:47,000
off of the material that they already

156
00:06:44,038 --> 00:06:49,279
had so of course this is going to bring

157
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:52,279
up problems of potential virus

158
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:54,839
transmission as you propagate uh vines

159
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:57,439
that have viruses already um but at the

160
00:06:54,839 --> 00:06:59,878
same time certain Vineyard especially

161
00:06:57,439 --> 00:07:02,918
this one that I was at in Thailand they

162
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:05,879
try to to take precautions to kind of

163
00:07:02,918 --> 00:07:07,959
prevent or at least mitigate the risk so

164
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:10,319
as you can see on the top left this is

165
00:07:07,959 --> 00:07:13,638
the fresh cuting that they got from The

166
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:16,639
Vines and the vineyard uh we

167
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:17,439
defoliated the branches and then prune

168
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:20,240
them

169
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:22,199
to lengths of about a foot maybe a

170
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:27,038
little longer as you can see in the

171
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:30,319
bottom left um this is when we were I

172
00:07:27,038 --> 00:07:32,120
guess sterilizing the vine so after we

173
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:35,080
runed them we stuck them in a hot water

174
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:39,800
bath at I believe it 50°

175
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:44,079
C maybe it's 80° C for uh about 30

176
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:46,478
minutes and there's some papers about

177
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:48,198
using this method to kind of kill any

178
00:07:46,478 --> 00:07:51,279
diseases that are present and try to

179
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:54,759
prevent the spreading of any uh trunk

180
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:58,000
diseases um once we finished that they

181
00:07:54,759 --> 00:07:59,960
were stuck in pots with instead of like

182
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:05,800
cocoa they have a lot of rice down there

183
00:07:59,959 --> 00:08:08,680
so it was that Rice hle um fine material

184
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:11,400
and the tops of the vines were painted

185
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:13,439
with paint mixed with fongicide to kind

186
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:16,519
of close the wound on the

187
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:18,800
top after a few months actually a couple

188
00:08:16,519 --> 00:08:21,560
months then this picture here is what

189
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:24,319
the result was and you can see something

190
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:26,120
similar when I visited uh TR and Brazil

191
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:27,598
where they also propagated all of their

192
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:30,879
own Vines as

193
00:08:27,598 --> 00:08:35,200
well for Vineyard to establishment it

194
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:38,719
was pretty standard um in Thailand or in

195
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:39,879
India they kind of just planted vines on

196
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:42,000
the ground of course you don't have to

197
00:08:39,879 --> 00:08:46,000
wait for fall or spring you can just

198
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,480
plant whenever you feel like it um and

199
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,639
then in Thailand they did something a

200
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:51,278
little bit more unique instead of

201
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:53,559
grafting The Vines uh before planting

202
00:08:51,278 --> 00:08:56,439
they actually planted the root stocks

203
00:08:53,559 --> 00:08:59,759
and then field grafted their explanation

204
00:08:56,440 --> 00:09:03,720
to me of why they did this is because

205
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:06,600
instead of having the Scion that has

206
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:09,440
your desired grape variety on top

207
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:11,639
immediately allowing the root stock to

208
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:14,240
take off and be as vigorous as I can to

209
00:09:11,639 --> 00:09:16,199
really establish its root system is what

210
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,039
they were going for and then later we'd

211
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:19,759
go into grafting and that'll be the next

212
00:09:18,039 --> 00:09:21,519
slide but I just thought this was a

213
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:23,958
little interesting on the right it's

214
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:26,039
nothing special it's just a great Vine

215
00:09:23,958 --> 00:09:28,239
but instead of using a stick to pull it

216
00:09:26,039 --> 00:09:30,599
up vertically they tie on like this

217
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:33,959
fishing line almost and tie it to the

218
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:35,480
top uh trellis and I just thought that

219
00:09:33,958 --> 00:09:38,679
was different I hadn't seen it

220
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:41,039
previously but uh we'll move to the

221
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:43,078
graftings you comment just briefly on

222
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:45,559
the sparkling that

223
00:09:43,078 --> 00:09:48,479
people where it's

224
00:09:45,559 --> 00:09:52,078
from yeah

225
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:54,240
so so this is from that Brazil region

226
00:09:52,078 --> 00:09:57,759
that I mentioned previously in

227
00:09:54,240 --> 00:10:00,879
petrolina the variety is Muscatel which

228
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:04,319
is a type of Musk I guess and this is a

229
00:10:00,879 --> 00:10:06,759
really common wine from the region that

230
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:09,600
uh dry semi arid

231
00:10:06,759 --> 00:10:12,759
region primarily makes white wines and

232
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:15,159
sparkling wines for red wines it's just

233
00:10:12,759 --> 00:10:17,319
not the best climate for it I guess

234
00:10:15,159 --> 00:10:20,679
because there isn't enough fluctuation

235
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:24,320
in temperature between day night and

236
00:10:20,679 --> 00:10:26,719
they also receive a lot of sun so they

237
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:30,040
said that whenever they get certain red

238
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:32,680
grapes it comes out very light and the

239
00:10:30,039 --> 00:10:34,879
tannins break down and there's nothing

240
00:10:32,679 --> 00:10:37,278
left in far as far as complexity in the

241
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:40,320
Reds so this is one of the most popular

242
00:10:37,278 --> 00:10:44,519
wines this bottle I believe is under

243
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:49,200
five US dollars so the market is to the

244
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:52,879
local Brazilian wine drinkers who uh are

245
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:56,839
relatively new I guess to Wine because

246
00:10:52,879 --> 00:10:59,919
they like their beers but yeah this is

247
00:10:56,839 --> 00:11:01,920
Muscat where was I okay graph

248
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:05,278
ing so for

249
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:07,078
grafting this is field grafting we took

250
00:11:05,278 --> 00:11:10,480
thean variety that was refrigerated from

251
00:11:07,078 --> 00:11:12,278
the previous pruning in the monsoon

252
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,920
season it was taken out of the

253
00:11:12,278 --> 00:11:15,759
refrigerator the root stock was split

254
00:11:13,919 --> 00:11:17,519
down the middle and then the cane is

255
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:20,240
shaved to a flat point it was cleft

256
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:23,879
grafting and one butt is cut from that

257
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:27,039
cane and inserted into the the slot and

258
00:11:23,879 --> 00:11:30,039
then wrap tightly with this plastic wrap

259
00:11:27,039 --> 00:11:33,599
pretty standard cleft grafting um but

260
00:11:30,039 --> 00:11:36,278
one of the things that they noticed here

261
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:39,120
is sometimes the plastic gets into the

262
00:11:36,278 --> 00:11:42,838
graph Union which will cause the vine to

263
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:44,720
die after a few years so um that's one

264
00:11:42,839 --> 00:11:46,560
of the downsides of this and it's also a

265
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:51,639
lot more labor intensive to go into the

266
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:51,638
field rather than bench crafting in a

267
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:57,720
room now move to training systems and

268
00:11:54,720 --> 00:12:00,480
this is another very unique thing to the

269
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:03,560
tropical regions often the not for the

270
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:06,399
wine grapes you would see double Cordon

271
00:12:03,559 --> 00:12:08,719
or single Cordon vssp systems as you see

272
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:09,799
on the top right this is the grand Monte

273
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:13,920
Winery in

274
00:12:09,799 --> 00:12:17,599
Thailand and this typically works very

275
00:12:13,919 --> 00:12:19,799
well for them but in addition to that

276
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:22,320
for the more vigorous varieties I think

277
00:12:19,799 --> 00:12:24,879
the only variety that that Winery did

278
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:28,000
cane pruning was for their

279
00:12:24,879 --> 00:12:32,000
muskat um otherwise it was all double

280
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:35,639
cord done spur pring um the training

281
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:37,159
system that you saw in Brazil was often

282
00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:40,680
similar although sometimes you saw

283
00:12:37,159 --> 00:12:44,159
Highwire cordons in this middle picture

284
00:12:40,679 --> 00:12:46,838
and uh in Brazil because the region is

285
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:50,759
also known for their table grape

286
00:12:46,839 --> 00:12:53,440
growing they had regular pergolas that

287
00:12:50,759 --> 00:12:56,000
they also grew table grapes on but they

288
00:12:53,440 --> 00:13:01,120
did this for wine grapes and it was

289
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:01,120
interesting I think this method

290
00:13:01,879 --> 00:13:09,159
is unique but at the same time there's a

291
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:10,920
lot less control over how many buds you

292
00:13:09,159 --> 00:13:13,439
have how many clusters you have unless

293
00:13:10,919 --> 00:13:16,278
you go through and kind of go underneath

294
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:18,079
to really look at everything but because

295
00:13:16,278 --> 00:13:20,679
this vineer didn't have too much

296
00:13:18,078 --> 00:13:22,519
mechanical operations it wasn't a big

297
00:13:20,679 --> 00:13:25,679
problem

298
00:13:22,519 --> 00:13:29,278
um and this middle picture at the bottom

299
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:32,000
is in India where as you can see see

300
00:13:29,278 --> 00:13:35,439
their training system is also

301
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:38,278
this y system just do you know the name

302
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:40,800
for the where they split it into a y

303
00:13:38,278 --> 00:13:43,519
it's called the Y system y system there

304
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:45,198
we go and in Thailand they also use this

305
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:47,240
and this is actually where they saw the

306
00:13:45,198 --> 00:13:49,519
best quality grapes and the highest

307
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:50,959
yields but Thailand didn't regularly use

308
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:53,480
this for all of their grapes because

309
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:55,359
they can't mechanize really anything in

310
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:57,440
that block so it makes it more

311
00:13:55,360 --> 00:14:00,000
challenging uh the system on the bottom

312
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:01,800
right is in Thailand as well but they

313
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,278
use for root stock growth so that they

314
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:06,359
can propagate and it's just a really

315
00:14:04,278 --> 00:14:08,600
easy method for them to grow The Grapes

316
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:12,759
so that's why they use

317
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:14,320
it so as far as pruning goes in Thailand

318
00:14:12,759 --> 00:14:17,440
the first thing they did was count the

319
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:20,079
cluster so they split the buds to see

320
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:22,199
how many uh infloresence they're

321
00:14:20,078 --> 00:14:25,919
expecting for the year to kind of

322
00:14:22,198 --> 00:14:29,479
estimate how many uh buds to prune to

323
00:14:25,919 --> 00:14:31,679
typically it's five to six Buds per spur

324
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:34,800
and they would only keep a couple on the

325
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:36,599
top um as you see they use diagonal

326
00:14:34,799 --> 00:14:40,000
pruning some people say that it's better

327
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:42,959
some don't but that's what they use the

328
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:46,159
five to six Buds per spur is what they

329
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:47,039
said to be a better amount of Spurs to

330
00:14:46,159 --> 00:14:50,639
keep

331
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:54,439
for yield rather than vegetative growth

332
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:56,560
at the lower buds um and then similar to

333
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:59,560
how we did the grafting they also sealed

334
00:14:56,559 --> 00:15:02,359
the pruning wounds with a mix of funu

335
00:14:59,559 --> 00:15:02,359
side with

336
00:15:03,039 --> 00:15:09,078
paint so the growing cycle is something

337
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:12,320
that is very distinct from anywhere else

338
00:15:09,078 --> 00:15:14,719
as I mentioned before in Thailand they

339
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:16,959
are able to have two growing Seasons but

340
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:18,600
they only harvest in one um so you can

341
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:22,239
kind of look at this and see they have

342
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:24,480
the rainfalls average between 2001 and

343
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:27,440
2011 um as well as temperatures they

344
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:29,079
have noticed that it has gotten warmer

345
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:31,800
um and the rain has been a little bit

346
00:15:29,078 --> 00:15:34,879
more variable because of climate change

347
00:15:31,799 --> 00:15:36,799
um but I thought this was a good chart

348
00:15:34,879 --> 00:15:38,679
to show because it really covers and

349
00:15:36,799 --> 00:15:40,838
highlights a lot of different things

350
00:15:38,679 --> 00:15:43,039
happening in the vineyard um throughout

351
00:15:40,839 --> 00:15:44,600
the growing season so you see pruning

352
00:15:43,039 --> 00:15:46,439
number one happens in April through May

353
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:48,199
and that's all vegetative and then

354
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:50,360
pruning number two happens September

355
00:15:48,198 --> 00:15:51,958
through October and then fruit set and

356
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:54,720
this is when they're looking to get

357
00:15:51,958 --> 00:15:55,919
their quality grapes here um you can

358
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:59,319
also see a

359
00:15:55,919 --> 00:16:02,479
distinct drop in rainfall in the season

360
00:15:59,318 --> 00:16:04,360
24 millim versus between

361
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:07,440
120 and

362
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:09,079
220 so that's uh pretty distinct

363
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,880
difference in rainfall and is which is

364
00:16:09,078 --> 00:16:15,159
why they go with this season to be the

365
00:16:10,879 --> 00:16:16,639
Fring season the pest pressures is also

366
00:16:15,159 --> 00:16:18,958
down here below I'm going to cover some

367
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:20,799
of these pests a little bit more later

368
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:22,638
but you can see at different points in

369
00:16:20,799 --> 00:16:25,838
the season they experience these

370
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:28,360
diseases um and of course birds will

371
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:30,000
always be there but can't do too much

372
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:35,680
about that other than putting a net or

373
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:35,679
making some noise cannons or lasers

374
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:48,039
so so to be able to do what they do

375
00:16:43,318 --> 00:16:51,838
here they induce dormany so prior to

376
00:16:48,039 --> 00:16:54,000
pruning they spray ethon and what this

377
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:57,639
does is really kind of prep the plant

378
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:59,720
and induce it into Dy and we prune it

379
00:16:57,639 --> 00:17:04,078
and we also defoliate they

380
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:05,400
go ahead and remove the leaves with a

381
00:17:04,078 --> 00:17:07,558
like a hedger they have people going

382
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:11,120
through just taking off the bulk of the

383
00:17:07,558 --> 00:17:14,918
vegetation there um but that is

384
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:18,078
generally how it's done about a couple

385
00:17:14,919 --> 00:17:23,759
days later they will then apply hydrogen

386
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:25,279
cyanamide to the buds and I believe some

387
00:17:23,759 --> 00:17:27,720
spray it but the vineyard I was

388
00:17:25,279 --> 00:17:29,839
interning at particularly in Thailand

389
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:33,440
they would actually go and get the

390
00:17:29,839 --> 00:17:34,879
mixture and then paint it onto the buds

391
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,240
rather than just spraying broadly

392
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:38,559
because I guess the buds is where it

393
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:40,720
needs this uh

394
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:43,240
application um you can see Bud burst

395
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:45,200
this is in Thailand maybe a week after

396
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:49,359
Bud burst a couple weeks and then this

397
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:53,798
is almost immediately after Bud burst in

398
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:55,359
Brazil so this does the Fon uh help to

399
00:17:53,798 --> 00:17:57,839
defoliate the

400
00:17:55,359 --> 00:18:00,519
plants at all or do they have to really

401
00:17:57,839 --> 00:18:03,759
go in and kind of aggressively

402
00:18:00,519 --> 00:18:05,599
defoliate you know so they sprayed this

403
00:18:03,759 --> 00:18:08,038
about right before I got there so I'm

404
00:18:05,599 --> 00:18:09,839
not exactly sure what it did um I did

405
00:18:08,038 --> 00:18:11,319
notice that there were some less leaves

406
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:12,918
but there were still a significant

407
00:18:11,319 --> 00:18:17,399
amount of leaves that needed to be

408
00:18:12,919 --> 00:18:20,720
pulled off by hand so it wasn't 100%

409
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:23,840
no um Kobe everyone has s your second

410
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:29,519
wine which there yes so the second wine

411
00:18:23,839 --> 00:18:31,759
here is from Thailand it's a shz

412
00:18:29,519 --> 00:18:34,359
um because they're close to Australia

413
00:18:31,759 --> 00:18:37,599
they use a lot of Australian terms for

414
00:18:34,359 --> 00:18:39,719
these wines and this is from Monsoon

415
00:18:37,599 --> 00:18:41,639
Valley it's the largest Winery in

416
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:43,839
Thailand

417
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:45,038
um trying to think a little bit about

418
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:48,678
this wine I

419
00:18:45,038 --> 00:18:51,079
believe this Winery they hyper use hyper

420
00:18:48,679 --> 00:18:54,400
oxidation in the beginning of the

421
00:18:51,079 --> 00:18:56,798
fermentation process and then ferment it

422
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:59,120
more or less normally through the end

423
00:18:56,798 --> 00:19:00,839
and blend it with the different blocks

424
00:18:59,119 --> 00:19:03,479
to try to get something consistent from

425
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:05,079
year to year um and try to keep these in

426
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:08,480
mind because at the end I'd like to ask

427
00:19:05,079 --> 00:19:11,480
your thoughts on these different wines

428
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,480
um

429
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:16,720
so okay so fruit

430
00:19:14,359 --> 00:19:19,759
set fruit

431
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:20,880
set happen pretty normally as you would

432
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:23,119
expect so I'm going to go through this

433
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:25,080
slide pretty quickly but the biggest

434
00:19:23,119 --> 00:19:27,079
problem that they experienced is dowy

435
00:19:25,079 --> 00:19:30,399
mildo as we could really get to the

436
00:19:27,079 --> 00:19:33,000
infloresence before it even sets causing

437
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:35,400
a big loss um something unique again

438
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:37,519
with these regions is because they don't

439
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:39,440
have a winter coming up they can't

440
00:19:37,519 --> 00:19:41,639
afford to be a little late on the

441
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:43,600
Harvest and there was one block that we

442
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:45,799
visited that was I think contracted out

443
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:48,519
but we still went to check it out and

444
00:19:45,798 --> 00:19:51,279
see how it was it had very very poor

445
00:19:48,519 --> 00:19:53,720
fruits at it had almost nothing because

446
00:19:51,279 --> 00:19:56,639
of Downey mildew and this was already a

447
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:58,839
month or two into the season but they

448
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:00,679
just pruned again and started all over

449
00:19:58,839 --> 00:20:04,079
and I wasn't there for when they

450
00:20:00,679 --> 00:20:05,440
harvested this block but uh I assume it

451
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:10,480
worked out because they like I said they

452
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:10,480
have a lot of time um to get the fruit

453
00:20:11,159 --> 00:20:16,679
in so this is some of the canopy

454
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:19,360
management that they do in India I

455
00:20:16,679 --> 00:20:22,360
notice probably the least canopy

456
00:20:19,359 --> 00:20:25,000
management um they were generally the

457
00:20:22,359 --> 00:20:29,158
Messier Vineyards that I visited um as

458
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:32,759
far as weed control and general

459
00:20:29,159 --> 00:20:34,919
maintenance of the vineyard um and then

460
00:20:32,759 --> 00:20:39,599
in Brazil you see them kind of just

461
00:20:34,919 --> 00:20:43,240
taking a handheld hedging tool to cut

462
00:20:39,599 --> 00:20:43,240
everything that's hanging out into the

463
00:20:43,759 --> 00:20:47,919
rows and then in

464
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:50,038
Thailand this was probably the most

465
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:52,559
painful thing I did while I was there

466
00:20:50,038 --> 00:20:56,158
they gave us lopping shears and we had

467
00:20:52,558 --> 00:20:57,158
to go overhead and L all day for a

468
00:20:56,159 --> 00:21:01,440
couple

469
00:20:57,159 --> 00:21:03,760
days and we tried to keep it within the

470
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:07,200
trellis wies so that way the growth is

471
00:21:03,759 --> 00:21:09,558
vertical whereas uh and then when we LED

472
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:11,278
we just took off the tops the tips

473
00:21:09,558 --> 00:21:12,960
whereas in Brazil some of these were

474
00:21:11,278 --> 00:21:14,240
hanging out of the side of the trellis

475
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:17,319
so they'd be cutting some branches very

476
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:18,720
short doing it this way but labor is

477
00:21:17,319 --> 00:21:20,678
really cheap in Thailand so that's why

478
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:25,519
they had just a few of us going out

479
00:21:20,679 --> 00:21:25,519
there and manually removing the the

480
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:32,840
top this is some of the other canopy

481
00:21:29,839 --> 00:21:35,839
management that we did um we' remove all

482
00:21:32,839 --> 00:21:37,720
the downward facing shoots as generally

483
00:21:35,839 --> 00:21:39,319
you don't want those and then early in

484
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:43,400
the season before Bud burst we went

485
00:21:39,319 --> 00:21:47,038
through and removed all the uh little

486
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:50,440
buds that were coming up across from the

487
00:21:47,038 --> 00:21:53,200
future clusters and they really try to

488
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:57,240
keep the fruit Zone open for disease

489
00:21:53,200 --> 00:22:00,759
reasons as well as uh ripening so we

490
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:03,720
went through before the vine got massive

491
00:22:00,759 --> 00:22:09,319
and really uh vigorous and removed all

492
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:09,319
of these little shoots here um we also

493
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:16,159
removed this is shoot selection so like

494
00:22:12,319 --> 00:22:19,439
I said we only select two shoots per

495
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:23,320
spur and that way you don't have too

496
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:25,850
much Vigor um across the vine because it

497
00:22:23,319 --> 00:22:27,519
as you can see here it already gets

498
00:22:25,849 --> 00:22:30,278
[Music]

499
00:22:27,519 --> 00:22:32,200
pretty developed in terms of leaf

500
00:22:30,278 --> 00:22:37,159
development and fruit development so we

501
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:41,440
go through and leaf pull um for better

502
00:22:37,159 --> 00:22:43,159
air circulation and Sun uh sun exposure

503
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:47,278
we Leaf pulled only on one side and this

504
00:22:43,159 --> 00:22:51,640
was the side that was facing

505
00:22:47,278 --> 00:22:53,200
the west and that way in the morning it

506
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:55,400
would be kind of protected from the Sun

507
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,840
in midday the whole canopy will protect

508
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:59,000
it and then it'll get a little bit more

509
00:22:56,839 --> 00:23:02,558
sun exposure in the afternoons

510
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:05,159
but you can see how much they Leaf pull

511
00:23:02,558 --> 00:23:07,319
they pretty much remove all the leaves

512
00:23:05,159 --> 00:23:09,600
from the lower part of the canopy and

513
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:12,200
then um a lot from the fruit Zone as

514
00:23:09,599 --> 00:23:17,359
well so it's a lot

515
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:21,640
of vegetative Management in terms of

516
00:23:17,359 --> 00:23:24,879
irrigation it was all water sources that

517
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:27,840
were available right on site so on the

518
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:31,640
left this is petrolina uh it's a big

519
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:34,000
lake the S Francisco River so this lake

520
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:36,600
is what they pull the water into through

521
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,679
this uh pump system and then what

522
00:23:36,599 --> 00:23:39,678
irrigate their fields with it in

523
00:23:38,679 --> 00:23:42,120
Thailand

524
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:45,320
similarly this is the vineyard the main

525
00:23:42,119 --> 00:23:47,439
Vineyard site where they have this big

526
00:23:45,319 --> 00:23:49,439
pond that they have this pump house that

527
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:50,880
would pump water through to the vineyard

528
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:54,600
and they would use this for fertigation

529
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:57,200
as well and in another site in Thailand

530
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:59,558
they also have water right there um I

531
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:01,759
don't have a picture of this but but in

532
00:23:59,558 --> 00:24:03,480
the southern Vineyard in Thailand that

533
00:24:01,759 --> 00:24:05,119
it's a little bit more Sandy of course

534
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:08,240
they have better drainage it's also a

535
00:24:05,119 --> 00:24:10,239
little drier um so they need to be

536
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:12,919
watering it a little more frequently

537
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:15,200
because you know generally if there's

538
00:24:12,919 --> 00:24:16,240
sandy soil the water just going to go

539
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:19,319
right through and you're not going to

540
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:20,798
have a lot of retention um but they also

541
00:24:19,319 --> 00:24:22,720
had a water shortage for that year so

542
00:24:20,798 --> 00:24:24,879
they had to determine which blocks they

543
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:26,240
would just kind of neglect for the year

544
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,480
and not water so there were certain

545
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:30,120
blocks because of water shortages that

546
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:31,880
just wouldn't water because there is no

547
00:24:30,119 --> 00:24:35,038
County water it's not really feasible to

548
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:37,600
bring in water um so like many other

549
00:24:35,038 --> 00:24:39,679
regions especially in California water

550
00:24:37,599 --> 00:24:42,158
can be a problem but it's generally not

551
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:46,038
in a lot of tropical

552
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:49,440
regions now we can uh for this next SL I

553
00:24:46,038 --> 00:24:52,440
guess before we get there let me just

554
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:52,440
see

555
00:24:53,558 --> 00:25:00,918
okay so this next line is a

556
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:04,120
Justin how do you say

557
00:25:00,919 --> 00:25:07,320
it bar Barbara Barbara

558
00:25:04,119 --> 00:25:11,079
Barbara and this Barbara is

559
00:25:07,319 --> 00:25:12,759
from Brazil as well um typically it's

560
00:25:11,079 --> 00:25:15,639
known to be a little bit more tanic and

561
00:25:12,759 --> 00:25:19,158
a bigger wine uh but in this region as I

562
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:21,440
said before it's also a region that is

563
00:25:19,159 --> 00:25:23,120
known not to have great Reds and known

564
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:27,038
to have low

565
00:25:23,119 --> 00:25:28,759
tannins so we will see what your

566
00:25:27,038 --> 00:25:30,759
thoughts are because typic typically the

567
00:25:28,759 --> 00:25:33,319
better wines that I tried were the ones

568
00:25:30,759 --> 00:25:34,759
that were typically supposed to be

569
00:25:33,319 --> 00:25:36,759
bolder because I guess when you have

570
00:25:34,759 --> 00:25:38,759
that loss you still have a higher amount

571
00:25:36,759 --> 00:25:43,480
to begin with so when you lose some of

572
00:25:38,759 --> 00:25:43,480
the tanin then it's not as big of a

573
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:52,320
deal but again I didn't try this one so

574
00:25:49,278 --> 00:25:52,319
love to hear your thoughts on

575
00:25:52,519 --> 00:25:56,879
that so for the other side of it because

576
00:25:55,798 --> 00:26:00,158
it is

577
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:02,120
so tropic coal sometimes you have a lot

578
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:05,200
of rain in Thailand you have the monsoon

579
00:26:02,119 --> 00:26:06,959
season a lot of rain in Brazil generally

580
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:11,278
you don't have too much but when you do

581
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:14,079
it can be a problem and across all of

582
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:18,759
the regions I noticed Rays

583
00:26:14,079 --> 00:26:22,038
grow uh like kind of mounded growing um

584
00:26:18,759 --> 00:26:24,158
so on the left side this is India and

585
00:26:22,038 --> 00:26:29,000
you can see that there's a hump where

586
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:34,600
the vines are planted in the row and

587
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:36,720
on this is also Brazil on the right and

588
00:26:34,599 --> 00:26:39,599
I thought I'd put one of Highland in

589
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:42,319
here but I don't have it um so they did

590
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:43,639
that to kind of keep the water table a

591
00:26:42,319 --> 00:26:45,158
little bit lower by having the vines

592
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:47,880
start off at a higher

593
00:26:45,159 --> 00:26:50,919
point and then aside from that there

594
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:54,080
were also Vineyards in Brazil where they

595
00:26:50,919 --> 00:26:55,600
had trenches that they dug to kind of

596
00:26:54,079 --> 00:26:57,599
help instead of tile drainage where you

597
00:26:55,599 --> 00:26:59,639
dig you set the tiles and then you kind

598
00:26:57,599 --> 00:27:01,839
of cover it back up they just dug it and

599
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:04,559
left it open and they

600
00:27:01,839 --> 00:27:07,678
have pipes or not pipes other trenches

601
00:27:04,558 --> 00:27:10,480
going across this way in some rows that

602
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:12,519
drain into this main trench so this is a

603
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:16,038
way that they kind of either lowered the

604
00:27:12,519 --> 00:27:18,599
water table or kept the root Zone a

605
00:27:16,038 --> 00:27:18,599
little bit

606
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:24,640
drier so some of the major pests that

607
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:28,759
were there are worms caterpillars and

608
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:32,880
thrips as well as melee bugs so we

609
00:27:28,759 --> 00:27:34,558
looking here can anybody def find or see

610
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:38,159
any

611
00:27:34,558 --> 00:27:38,158
pest here

612
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:45,960
anybody yeah

613
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:48,359
okay

614
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:50,880
so it's right here on this Leaf you

615
00:27:48,359 --> 00:27:54,119
can't really see I believe that's a Mee

616
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:57,760
bug this is for sure a melee bug uh

617
00:27:54,119 --> 00:27:57,759
anyone know what this is

618
00:27:59,798 --> 00:28:05,398
these are worm eggs so you'll see this

619
00:28:02,599 --> 00:28:08,278
worm in the tropics quite a bit I'm not

620
00:28:05,398 --> 00:28:12,319
sure if they're coming here or not um

621
00:28:08,278 --> 00:28:14,919
but these are the egg nests for these

622
00:28:12,319 --> 00:28:17,678
worms here they're also large

623
00:28:14,919 --> 00:28:22,200
caterpillars in

624
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:24,000
Thailand so that is it's kind of freaky

625
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:27,038
when you came across one of these and

626
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:30,159
then there were these weird horn beetles

627
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:33,599
that would bore into some of these

628
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:36,000
Trunks and it basically ate into this

629
00:28:33,599 --> 00:28:37,959
spur across part of this trunk and went

630
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,038
in this way and we kept cutting back

631
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:42,600
cutting back cutting back and then it

632
00:28:40,038 --> 00:28:44,599
wasn't there but we ended up cutting off

633
00:28:42,599 --> 00:28:47,480
this whole part of the Cordon because it

634
00:28:44,599 --> 00:28:50,359
was eaten through it there was a big

635
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:53,640
hole not too common but it is there

636
00:28:50,359 --> 00:28:58,278
aside from insect pests there are also

637
00:28:53,640 --> 00:29:02,759
other animal predation pests such as bir

638
00:28:58,278 --> 00:29:04,599
birds in Brazil you would have these big

639
00:29:02,759 --> 00:29:07,759
birds and sometimes two cans come in

640
00:29:04,599 --> 00:29:09,079
eating your grapes and in Thailand you

641
00:29:07,759 --> 00:29:10,640
would have monkeys coming in from the

642
00:29:09,079 --> 00:29:11,759
forest as well as once in a while you'd

643
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:13,720
have elephants marching into the

644
00:29:11,759 --> 00:29:16,480
vineyard and they

645
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:17,880
had uh barbed wire or fencing all around

646
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:19,159
the place but there's one section where

647
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:21,399
the elephant didn't care you know they

648
00:29:19,159 --> 00:29:22,600
just come right through and not much you

649
00:29:21,398 --> 00:29:25,678
can do about

650
00:29:22,599 --> 00:29:27,719
that um so it's kind of kind of a tough

651
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:29,038
situation there but luckily it's not too

652
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,960
common

653
00:29:29,038 --> 00:29:33,640
uh for

654
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:38,000
viruses rupes stem pitting is a common

655
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:39,720
one leaf roll is another um because as I

656
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:42,839
mentioned they propagate their own Vines

657
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:45,880
and there's no virus free initiatives

658
00:29:42,839 --> 00:29:48,398
there you know there will be more of

659
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:50,399
these viruses present I believe this is

660
00:29:48,398 --> 00:29:52,798
some kind of virus I can't say exactly

661
00:29:50,398 --> 00:29:55,038
what it is it could be possib role do

662
00:29:52,798 --> 00:29:57,639
you have any idea Justine or

663
00:29:55,038 --> 00:30:00,119
anybody yeah hard to say and then this

664
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:02,080
trunk with was also split could be virus

665
00:30:00,119 --> 00:30:05,678
maybe not what virus I'm not sure and

666
00:30:02,079 --> 00:30:08,079
there's buter Saria trunk disease as

667
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:11,360
well um and this is what I'm being shown

668
00:30:08,079 --> 00:30:13,240
here by the vineyard manager in southern

669
00:30:11,359 --> 00:30:16,719
Thailand and he is actually from Germany

670
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:18,319
he did an internship there and liked it

671
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:19,679
he was asked to stay so he stayed there

672
00:30:18,319 --> 00:30:22,319
and he's been working there for about 12

673
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:24,038
years now but it's interesting because

674
00:30:22,319 --> 00:30:26,439
this guy as well as the person I was

675
00:30:24,038 --> 00:30:28,319
working with both were trained in the

676
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:30,558
more traditional regions he was trained

677
00:30:28,319 --> 00:30:32,158
in Germany the person that I was uh

678
00:30:30,558 --> 00:30:35,240
working under in Thailand she was

679
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:38,278
trained in Australia so they both have a

680
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:42,480
better idea of some of the scientific

681
00:30:38,278 --> 00:30:42,480
developments and other good

682
00:30:43,079 --> 00:30:48,678
practices weed management was another

683
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:50,319
thing as I mentioned people spray um

684
00:30:48,679 --> 00:30:52,679
India didn't really have too much weed

685
00:30:50,319 --> 00:30:55,359
management happening one Vineyard in

686
00:30:52,679 --> 00:30:57,240
Thailand had sheep that they were

687
00:30:55,359 --> 00:31:00,479
through their field this was a organic

688
00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:01,558
Vineyard so they tried to not use too

689
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:05,759
many

690
00:31:01,558 --> 00:31:07,200
things um but sheep and then in this

691
00:31:05,759 --> 00:31:10,398
other veneer that I was interning at

692
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:11,679
they used hes these white base hes and

693
00:31:10,398 --> 00:31:14,479
we kind of just dug up the weeds under

694
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:17,200
the vines again it took a lot of manual

695
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:20,720
effort but works I

696
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:23,880
guess um and diseases dowy mildew

697
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:28,360
powdery mildew and thos are common um

698
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:29,679
some anthos on these grapes here um noo

699
00:31:28,359 --> 00:31:33,678
on this

700
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:37,519
Leaf um I think it's powdery on this

701
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:40,798
one just a lot of disease in here and

702
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:42,159
this is the organic Vineyard here so

703
00:31:40,798 --> 00:31:45,960
that's probably

704
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:47,039
why and what they did for this is they

705
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:48,919
had their

706
00:31:47,038 --> 00:31:52,319
typical

707
00:31:48,919 --> 00:31:54,960
sprays um but as in addition to that

708
00:31:52,319 --> 00:31:57,519
they would use some other things my

709
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:59,278
notes didn't transfer but they have

710
00:31:57,519 --> 00:32:01,558
other

711
00:31:59,278 --> 00:32:04,119
sprays such as

712
00:32:01,558 --> 00:32:06,558
this type

713
00:32:04,119 --> 00:32:08,719
of find

714
00:32:06,558 --> 00:32:10,398
it yeah sorry this presentation was

715
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:13,120
supposed to be on my laptop here but

716
00:32:10,398 --> 00:32:16,879
then it wasn't working so I put it here

717
00:32:13,119 --> 00:32:18,359
and didn't share this other part but uh

718
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:20,480
it's some kind of biological control I

719
00:32:18,359 --> 00:32:21,839
can look it up after and let you know

720
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:24,639
what it

721
00:32:21,839 --> 00:32:25,918
was uh continuous harvesting in Brazil I

722
00:32:24,638 --> 00:32:27,719
just wanted to touch on this I mentioned

723
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:29,200
it previously but unlike Thailand where

724
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:31,440
they have so much rain in one season and

725
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:32,919
no rain in the other they were just dry

726
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:34,880
year round so they could just

727
00:32:32,919 --> 00:32:38,000
continuously Harvest as soon as you

728
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:42,120
prune the vine you could then go ahead

729
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:44,359
and start the next growing season um so

730
00:32:42,119 --> 00:32:46,638
all of these pictures were all happening

731
00:32:44,359 --> 00:32:48,000
within one month of each other and as

732
00:32:46,638 --> 00:32:51,038
you can see they're all in very

733
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:55,480
different stages here you have recently

734
00:32:51,038 --> 00:32:57,278
prune no bud burst at all and then here

735
00:32:55,480 --> 00:33:00,720
you see vegetation I believe they're

736
00:32:57,278 --> 00:33:04,679
just across the the aisle from each

737
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:06,880
other um but in very different stages

738
00:33:04,679 --> 00:33:09,880
and then another Vineyard at the same

739
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:13,799
time is also almost ready to harvest

740
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:16,120
here so again a very unique opportunity

741
00:33:13,798 --> 00:33:19,038
for these Vineyards and possibly a

742
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:21,199
unique opportunity to explore further um

743
00:33:19,038 --> 00:33:21,200
as

744
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:26,359
well out side of that here are some

745
00:33:24,798 --> 00:33:28,480
other interesting things that I didn't

746
00:33:26,359 --> 00:33:32,000
really expect but can anybody see the

747
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:36,038
snake in this bottom picture

748
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:38,558
yeah yeah and then the snake head

749
00:33:36,038 --> 00:33:40,278
here so and then this is when it came

750
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:43,000
out but I was actually stepping on this

751
00:33:40,278 --> 00:33:45,720
snake when we were grafting I was

752
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:48,638
sitting down on a stool I was cutting

753
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:50,919
the vine and I felt my the ground moving

754
00:33:48,638 --> 00:33:52,959
under me I didn't know what it was so I

755
00:33:50,919 --> 00:33:55,840
stopped I kind of look and then I get

756
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:58,480
back to work and I feel it again and I

757
00:33:55,839 --> 00:34:00,000
really wasn't sure what it was

758
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:01,839
and then I thought maybe I just

759
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,558
dehydrated because it was very hot it

760
00:34:01,839 --> 00:34:07,879
was in the mid 90s with like 90%

761
00:34:04,558 --> 00:34:09,279
humidity full sun it was brutal um but

762
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:12,119
it was a snake and what we ended up

763
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:14,399
doing for the next hour is catching the

764
00:34:12,119 --> 00:34:15,639
snake and then we released it right

765
00:34:14,398 --> 00:34:18,960
across the street so it probably came

766
00:34:15,639 --> 00:34:20,280
right back the next hour but we CAU the

767
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:22,679
snake and this is a different snake this

768
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:25,560
is a tree snake and a little bit more

769
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:28,760
scary because when we're working in the

770
00:34:25,559 --> 00:34:30,480
canopy you might accident accidentally

771
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:33,240
touch the snake or get too close and it

772
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:34,398
might bite you um luckily someone saw it

773
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:36,918
and then

774
00:34:34,398 --> 00:34:41,039
we whacked it with a stick and this one

775
00:34:36,918 --> 00:34:41,039
died so this one won't be coming

776
00:34:42,519 --> 00:34:46,320
back and this is just another thing that

777
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:49,000
I wanted to bring up I wasn't really

778
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:51,679
sure what to make of it but air Roots

779
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:56,239
were very common you don't see it as

780
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:58,920
much I would say here um but they were

781
00:34:56,239 --> 00:35:02,598
on a lot of the vines and

782
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:04,200
quite quite a bit of it too so I don't

783
00:35:02,599 --> 00:35:07,119
know if anyone here has any experience

784
00:35:04,199 --> 00:35:09,639
with why this might be the case in the

785
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:12,680
tropics just wanted to kind of see it a

786
00:35:09,639 --> 00:35:14,639
lot in more human So Long Island for

787
00:35:12,679 --> 00:35:16,960
example it's actually quite common

788
00:35:14,639 --> 00:35:19,199
aerial Roots we don't see it very often

789
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:21,800
up here unless it's very humid

790
00:35:19,199 --> 00:35:24,838
here okay so it's just the humidity

791
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:28,240
somehow the plant wants

792
00:35:24,838 --> 00:35:30,799
to okay yeah this is very very typical

793
00:35:28,239 --> 00:35:33,199
to see and these are just some of the

794
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:35,280
people that I worked with uh who hosted

795
00:35:33,199 --> 00:35:37,078
me while I was there um this is one of

796
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:39,280
The Vineyards that they grew table

797
00:35:37,079 --> 00:35:40,839
grapes but they also made wine this is

798
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:43,320
the third wine this last one that you

799
00:35:40,838 --> 00:35:44,960
just had um was from this Vineyard that

800
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:47,720
they grew it on a overhead

801
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:49,639
pergola um this is another block of the

802
00:35:47,719 --> 00:35:53,639
same

803
00:35:49,639 --> 00:35:58,440
Vineyard in this picture it

804
00:35:53,639 --> 00:35:59,339
is in another Petrina um Vineyard

805
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:02,479
I believe this is

806
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:02,479
[Music]

807
00:36:02,639 --> 00:36:08,879
the okay this is a different one but

808
00:36:05,358 --> 00:36:08,880
yeah this that's good thank

809
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:12,559
you I thought there was

810
00:36:13,519 --> 00:36:18,599
one um this first one that you had the

811
00:36:16,639 --> 00:36:20,358
sparkling was this Vineyard that I

812
00:36:18,599 --> 00:36:21,599
visited and they make a lot of sparkling

813
00:36:20,358 --> 00:36:23,920
they also make wine for a lot of

814
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:25,680
different labels it was just a huge

815
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:28,119
facility and then these are the people

816
00:36:25,679 --> 00:36:30,399
that I interned worked with in

817
00:36:28,119 --> 00:36:32,838
Thailand um

818
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:36,000
here and of course there has to be a

819
00:36:32,838 --> 00:36:38,759
Vineyard dog Thailand had Vineyard five

820
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:40,358
dogs a lot of them are wild um but this

821
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:44,200
one was named

822
00:36:40,358 --> 00:36:46,719
namt and yeah can move to question as

823
00:36:44,199 --> 00:36:49,118
manushi pours this last wine that is

824
00:36:46,719 --> 00:36:51,318
from Thailand this is the vineyard that

825
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:56,800
I internet I thought that they had the

826
00:36:51,318 --> 00:36:59,800
best line overall that I tried so um

827
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:02,680
yeah what cultivar is this one this is a

828
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:02,680
petit s

829
00:37:03,358 --> 00:37:08,920
dff Thailand what is the typical

830
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:11,039
timeline for production there do they

831
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:13,599
try to avoid the monsoon season or do

832
00:37:11,039 --> 00:37:16,519
they figure out a way to work that in no

833
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:19,880
they they pretty much have a full

834
00:37:16,519 --> 00:37:22,440
growing cycle during the Monson season

835
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:23,838
they just remove all the grapes um so

836
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:26,318
the plant can just have vegetative

837
00:37:23,838 --> 00:37:28,719
growth uh because unfortunately

838
00:37:26,318 --> 00:37:31,559
unfortunately I guess The Vines don't

839
00:37:28,719 --> 00:37:34,838
experience any natural dorcy and because

840
00:37:31,559 --> 00:37:35,759
of that it's going to keep growing and

841
00:37:34,838 --> 00:37:39,039
you

842
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:41,240
can make it here you can make it

843
00:37:39,039 --> 00:37:43,119
dormant but you can't make it stay

844
00:37:41,239 --> 00:37:46,679
dormant for too long it's going to come

845
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:49,358
back sooner than later so rather than

846
00:37:46,679 --> 00:37:52,118
just keep killing them everything that's

847
00:37:49,358 --> 00:37:54,559
out there they just let it grow let it

848
00:37:52,119 --> 00:37:57,519
uh just have vegetation and then prune

849
00:37:54,559 --> 00:38:01,679
it before the season that they want um

850
00:37:57,519 --> 00:38:01,679
as you can see here

851
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:07,280
between in September they prune fruit

852
00:38:05,639 --> 00:38:09,199
sets going to be in October and it's

853
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:12,319
September through October because a lot

854
00:38:09,199 --> 00:38:15,159
of different blocks um take time to go

855
00:38:12,318 --> 00:38:18,358
through and they also start off with I

856
00:38:15,159 --> 00:38:20,159
believe the Reds and then do the whites

857
00:38:18,358 --> 00:38:22,400
because the whites have a shorter

858
00:38:20,159 --> 00:38:24,118
growing season fruits set happens here

859
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:26,960
generally and then grows through

860
00:38:24,119 --> 00:38:29,480
December January and then the sparkling

861
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:32,280
that will harvest in January typically

862
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:34,960
you can do an earlier Harvest and uh the

863
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:38,519
Reds February the bigger Reds like this

864
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:40,720
one maybe Cabernet San could be end of

865
00:38:38,519 --> 00:38:43,000
March sometimes I think it can go

866
00:38:40,719 --> 00:38:45,679
through maybe a early April but usually

867
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:49,679
by March that's the

868
00:38:45,679 --> 00:38:52,679
end yeah yes how about the management

869
00:38:49,679 --> 00:38:54,639
what kind ofer that they use and do they

870
00:38:52,679 --> 00:38:57,039
use like organic

871
00:38:54,639 --> 00:38:58,799
fertilizer organic isn't too big of a

872
00:38:57,039 --> 00:39:00,358
thing so most of The Vineyards don't do

873
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:03,119
organic that one that I showed you with

874
00:39:00,358 --> 00:39:06,279
the Sheep is the only one that I know of

875
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:08,519
who goes out of their way to use organic

876
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:10,599
management as far as the exact types of

877
00:39:08,519 --> 00:39:11,880
a fertilizer I'm not sure this is a

878
00:39:10,599 --> 00:39:14,039
discussion that I had with Justine

879
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:17,200
yesterday about some of the uh

880
00:39:14,039 --> 00:39:20,119
pesticides and fdes that they use I

881
00:39:17,199 --> 00:39:22,960
asked about it and they gave me this

882
00:39:20,119 --> 00:39:25,760
sheet the their spray schedule and half

883
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:28,318
of it's in Thai and when you translate

884
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:30,160
it didn't exactly come out um so I'm not

885
00:39:28,318 --> 00:39:30,920
exactly sure what they do but I do know

886
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:34,239
that they

887
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:35,119
ferate um across I think several of the

888
00:39:34,239 --> 00:39:37,358
different Vineyards I went to they

889
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:38,599
ferate quite a bit so I'd assume it's

890
00:39:37,358 --> 00:39:40,880
more or less standard and it's going to

891
00:39:38,599 --> 00:39:42,079
kind of depend on uh the situation at

892
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:45,280
each Vineyard depending on what they

893
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:48,640
need in there for their

894
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:50,880
soil yes already mentioned this but

895
00:39:48,639 --> 00:39:52,960
regarding the amount of like sunlight

896
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:54,960
cloud cover that you see throughout the

897
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:57,760
growing Seasons that people choose do

898
00:39:54,960 --> 00:40:02,240
use find that some regions had more

899
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:02,240
consistent sunlight or is it

900
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:09,400
variable

901
00:40:05,318 --> 00:40:10,960
so this this is for uh Thailand

902
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:15,480
specifically

903
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:17,559
um generally in September October it's

904
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:20,679
still the very edge or like end of

905
00:40:17,559 --> 00:40:23,880
monsoon season so there's some rain and

906
00:40:20,679 --> 00:40:28,039
cloud cover once you get to the end of

907
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:31,800
October November it is very very Sunny

908
00:40:28,039 --> 00:40:34,239
very hot uh all the way through December

909
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:36,440
and then January so they get a lot of

910
00:40:34,239 --> 00:40:40,159
sun if you go further south to the other

911
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:45,440
Vineyard it is also very sunny um hotter

912
00:40:40,159 --> 00:40:48,519
too in India it can also be fairly Sunny

913
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:51,119
although there you know are clouds um in

914
00:40:48,519 --> 00:40:52,440
Brazil it would also be very sunny as

915
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:55,519
well so all of these regions had a lot

916
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:57,440
of sun cloud cover occasionally but it

917
00:40:55,519 --> 00:41:02,358
wasn't a regular thing and it's not to

918
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:02,358
be expected either too too

919
00:41:05,199 --> 00:41:08,799
often continu

920
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:16,599
gr that's a great question

921
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:18,400
so I've heard that in the southern part

922
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:20,160
of Brazil they do have to do replants a

923
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:21,760
little more often or actually not the

924
00:41:20,159 --> 00:41:24,199
southern the northern part of it they

925
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:27,319
need to do it more often that's what I

926
00:41:24,199 --> 00:41:29,759
heard from some people who told me um I

927
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:32,960
outside of there but when I spoke to the

928
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:36,800
folks at one of The Vineyards there they

929
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:38,199
were saying it's so new that they're not

930
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:40,440
entirely sure how long the vines will

931
00:41:38,199 --> 00:41:43,480
last they only really planted about 30

932
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:45,480
years ago and that's their oldest block

933
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:47,760
and they haven't had to do a replant yet

934
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:50,039
for that block um and that's one of the

935
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:52,280
most established longest you know

936
00:41:50,039 --> 00:41:56,440
lasting Vineyards there so as far as

937
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:58,720
they know no it's not any shorter but at

938
00:41:56,440 --> 00:42:02,280
the same time

939
00:41:58,719 --> 00:42:06,039
we don't really know C for

940
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:11,119
certain yes so with the continuous har

941
00:42:06,039 --> 00:42:14,559
so you mentioned spr Dy yes doing can

942
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:17,160
you get more gra to grow just by pring

943
00:42:14,559 --> 00:42:20,239
or you always have to spray something to

944
00:42:17,159 --> 00:42:23,159
force the vine dorcy first or can you

945
00:42:20,239 --> 00:42:24,519
just print it and it'll grow more graes

946
00:42:23,159 --> 00:42:27,199
you could prune it I think the idea

947
00:42:24,519 --> 00:42:29,280
behind spraying is to kind of allow the

948
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:30,679
plant sometime to pull back some

949
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:34,559
nutrients back to its roots and like

950
00:42:30,679 --> 00:42:37,159
kind of store um but in terms of being

951
00:42:34,559 --> 00:42:39,160
able to just prune that's that's a

952
00:42:37,159 --> 00:42:41,279
possibility I'd say the bigger bigger

953
00:42:39,159 --> 00:42:48,598
thing is coming out of

954
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:51,760
dormy um applying the ethon or ethon no

955
00:42:48,599 --> 00:42:54,920
the cyanamide yes the cyanamide is a

956
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:56,760
bigger thing uh because you will get Bud

957
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:57,720
bursts regardless of whether you apply

958
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:59,839
that or not

959
00:42:57,719 --> 00:43:03,199
but this allows for more uniform Bud

960
00:42:59,838 --> 00:43:05,719
burst otherwise what you may see is Bud

961
00:43:03,199 --> 00:43:08,239
burst towards the edges because of

962
00:43:05,719 --> 00:43:10,239
apical dominance whereas the middle

963
00:43:08,239 --> 00:43:12,279
might not have very much or it might

964
00:43:10,239 --> 00:43:14,719
be weaker

965
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:16,240
growth um and because the outer ones are

966
00:43:14,719 --> 00:43:18,480
going to be a lot more developed by the

967
00:43:16,239 --> 00:43:20,399
time the middle one even burst it's

968
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:22,960
going to have uneven ripening if you

969
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:24,160
have fruit and it could just over the

970
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:26,159
outer ones could overtake the middle and

971
00:43:24,159 --> 00:43:28,719
the middle might not grow enough at all

972
00:43:26,159 --> 00:43:32,078
so that's the big thing and um one of

973
00:43:28,719 --> 00:43:34,639
The Vineyards in Brazil specifically

974
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:37,920
mentioned instead of using cyanamide

975
00:43:34,639 --> 00:43:42,000
they use a garlic mix like it's garlic

976
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:44,599
in water and they put that on um and it

977
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:47,599
works I don't know if it works I I think

978
00:43:44,599 --> 00:43:50,680
I heard a couple people using that and

979
00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:51,480
the the organic Winery in Thailand also

980
00:43:50,679 --> 00:43:54,719
said

981
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:57,318
that it's I think it needs to be looked

982
00:43:54,719 --> 00:43:59,879
at a little more I did see one people

983
00:43:57,318 --> 00:44:04,079
that kind of mentions that um if I find

984
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:06,720
it I can send it out but it

985
00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:09,760
is supposedly

986
00:44:06,719 --> 00:44:13,358
effective can take you with a grain of

987
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:15,680
salt Marin a question for just a

988
00:44:13,358 --> 00:44:18,159
general so I assume you're not fluent

989
00:44:15,679 --> 00:44:21,639
Portuguese or so how did it work you

990
00:44:18,159 --> 00:44:23,639
know not being a speaker commun Growers

991
00:44:21,639 --> 00:44:26,118
managers and so forth and would you

992
00:44:23,639 --> 00:44:28,318
advise other students to go to places

993
00:44:26,119 --> 00:44:31,800
even though they might not

994
00:44:28,318 --> 00:44:34,719
Lang yeah yeah the experience was pretty

995
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:36,800
good with the places that I got more

996
00:44:34,719 --> 00:44:39,239
from I would say were the ones that

997
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:41,280
spoke some English as I mentioned the

998
00:44:39,239 --> 00:44:43,598
place I've interned at she spoke English

999
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:46,440
she studied in Australia she knew kind

1000
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:48,800
of what she was doing as far as in

1001
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:51,838
addition the one in the South he was in

1002
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:55,000
Germany you know German speak English

1003
00:44:51,838 --> 00:44:58,960
more or less and he also had a good idea

1004
00:44:55,000 --> 00:45:00,960
of what he's doing so I think

1005
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:03,240
it is a great thing to go out and meet

1006
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:05,920
other people from other places and

1007
00:45:03,239 --> 00:45:09,399
there's almost always someone who can

1008
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:11,000
speak English and if not like in uh

1009
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:12,358
let's see Thailand some places nobody

1010
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:15,639
spoke English some people only spoke

1011
00:45:12,358 --> 00:45:18,000
Portuguese and Brazil but I mean we live

1012
00:45:15,639 --> 00:45:19,400
in a good time when we have Google

1013
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:23,199
translate and there's a transcribed

1014
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:24,920
feature so I could just record and they

1015
00:45:23,199 --> 00:45:27,639
speak and I can just read exactly what

1016
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:29,200
they're saying so there's a lot of great

1017
00:45:27,639 --> 00:45:31,039
opportunity now that you can do that

1018
00:45:29,199 --> 00:45:33,480
type of thing with people that you

1019
00:45:31,039 --> 00:45:35,400
wouldn't have been able to before but

1020
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:37,800
now you can so yes I wouldn't say that

1021
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:40,800
it's a limiting factor at

1022
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:40,800
all

1023
00:45:42,679 --> 00:45:47,838
yes yeah yeah so after they prune some

1024
00:45:46,159 --> 00:45:50,399
of it is used for

1025
00:45:47,838 --> 00:45:54,358
propagation um and then the rest of it

1026
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:56,119
is dumped into the forest or somewhere

1027
00:45:54,358 --> 00:45:58,000
because we're in a very rural area and

1028
00:45:56,119 --> 00:46:00,960
there's nobody around they just have a

1029
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:04,239
big pile

1030
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:05,920
generally and it gives a very nice I

1031
00:46:04,239 --> 00:46:10,358
don't want to

1032
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:13,318
me yeah yeah I think in Thailand one of

1033
00:46:10,358 --> 00:46:15,880
The Vineyards did sell some of the

1034
00:46:13,318 --> 00:46:17,920
cuting they dried out cuting for that

1035
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:20,559
but I don't think it's a tradition or

1036
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:21,760
something that everyone regularly does

1037
00:46:20,559 --> 00:46:24,640
um in any of these countries so it's

1038
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:27,800
mostly either composted or thrown off to

1039
00:46:24,639 --> 00:46:29,480
the side something like that yeah

1040
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:31,000
you think you'll learn what do you think

1041
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:33,559
you've learned that you'll apply to your

1042
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:37,039
time in um or when you set

1043
00:46:33,559 --> 00:46:38,760
placeis a lot so one of the things I did

1044
00:46:37,039 --> 00:46:41,239
notice is certain varieties just don't

1045
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:43,680
do well at all in Brazil they didn't

1046
00:46:41,239 --> 00:46:46,358
work in Thailand they didn't work and

1047
00:46:43,679 --> 00:46:48,598
one of those varieties is like pin Noir

1048
00:46:46,358 --> 00:46:52,639
in Thailand they could barely get the

1049
00:46:48,599 --> 00:46:54,599
plant to grow um it's there but it has

1050
00:46:52,639 --> 00:46:57,799
no fruit and it's been maybe four or

1051
00:46:54,599 --> 00:46:59,280
five years now and then in

1052
00:46:57,800 --> 00:47:00,800
Brazil there was a vineard that is

1053
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:04,480
growing P

1054
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:06,000
Noir but I think they're only getting

1055
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:09,440
about

1056
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:12,000
maybe one case of wine per acre or

1057
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:13,679
something crazy low and they have to

1058
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:17,480
charge a ridiculous amount for that

1059
00:47:13,679 --> 00:47:19,639
bottle because it just costs a lot to do

1060
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:22,280
and yeah it's just certain varieties

1061
00:47:19,639 --> 00:47:25,838
don't work certain ones do peti SAR SAR

1062
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:27,480
are very good um as well as the canopy

1063
00:47:25,838 --> 00:47:30,318
management another thing that I forgot

1064
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:32,599
to mention in preventing disease is

1065
00:47:30,318 --> 00:47:35,599
whenever it rains to prevent Downey

1066
00:47:32,599 --> 00:47:38,359
mildew they will just take the sprayer

1067
00:47:35,599 --> 00:47:40,559
through the vineyard RS and they'll just

1068
00:47:38,358 --> 00:47:42,318
turn the fan on high and blow off the

1069
00:47:40,559 --> 00:47:45,760
water they won't spray anything and

1070
00:47:42,318 --> 00:47:48,800
that's just to dry out the flowers so

1071
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:50,160
that they don't get dowy mildew that's

1072
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:52,400
something that I would probably do

1073
00:47:50,159 --> 00:47:54,239
because it's from what I understand it

1074
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:57,240
makes all the difference in preventing

1075
00:47:54,239 --> 00:47:57,239
dowy

1076
00:47:57,280 --> 00:48:02,000
maybe last question and then we got to

1077
00:47:59,318 --> 00:48:02,000
wrap up

1078
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:07,880
yes I just was gonna ask the um Market

1079
00:48:05,599 --> 00:48:10,640
or how has Market change for these these

1080
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:13,440
regions and I guess are they exporting a

1081
00:48:10,639 --> 00:48:16,358
lot or is just kind of stay in Thailand

1082
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:19,318
the market is very small um their

1083
00:48:16,358 --> 00:48:21,119
religion I think it's Buddhism they

1084
00:48:19,318 --> 00:48:22,480
actually weren't supposed to drink I

1085
00:48:21,119 --> 00:48:25,920
think at one point the strict Buddhists

1086
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:30,838
and the newer ones do um but a lot of

1087
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:33,559
it's beer song beer and Chang are the

1088
00:48:30,838 --> 00:48:36,279
two most common wine is a very new thing

1089
00:48:33,559 --> 00:48:37,800
it's starting to grow you see some

1090
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:40,400
domestic tourists coming to visit the

1091
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:43,519
vineyard but generally it's the

1092
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:45,519
wealthier ones because I mean the wages

1093
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:47,880
in US Dollars would be like $10 a day so

1094
00:48:45,519 --> 00:48:49,519
it's barely anything um so they can't

1095
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:51,798
really afford it so you're going to see

1096
00:48:49,519 --> 00:48:54,639
the higher income classes getting these

1097
00:48:51,798 --> 00:48:57,880
Wines in Brazil they're able to

1098
00:48:54,639 --> 00:48:59,400
mechanize a lot more um than Canon they

1099
00:48:57,880 --> 00:49:01,039
produce cheaper wines that are like

1100
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:03,200
under $5 a bottle they make a little bit

1101
00:49:01,039 --> 00:49:05,960
more so you do see more of a domestic

1102
00:49:03,199 --> 00:49:09,039
Market Brazil isn't exporting too much

1103
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:11,358
Thailand is to the neighboring countries

1104
00:49:09,039 --> 00:49:14,480
Singapore China these other countries

1105
00:49:11,358 --> 00:49:17,000
that have higher incomes maybe not

1106
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:19,519
overall but higher income individuals

1107
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:22,480
that can afford it um otherwise that's

1108
00:49:19,519 --> 00:49:25,119
about the extent I would

1109
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:28,719
say right we need to wrap up please join

1110
00:49:25,119 --> 00:49:28,720
me in thanking Kobe

1111
00:49:30,318 --> 00:49:34,440
if you're interested in the Dreer watch

1112
00:49:32,318 --> 00:49:37,880
the horiculture

1113
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:41,798
uh Andor reach out to Martin H who would

1114
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:44,440
be happy to share some information I

1115
00:49:41,798 --> 00:49:47,318
think this has been a production of

1116
