1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,800
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:11,400
University thanks thanks

3
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,839
Neil well thank you it's been it's a

4
00:00:14,638 --> 00:00:17,559
real pleasure to be here and it's really

5
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:19,359
nice to be right after Paul because

6
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:22,239
Paul's really and his team has done have

7
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:25,960
done a really great piece of work uh

8
00:00:22,239 --> 00:00:28,399
they continue to do good work so but

9
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:30,880
first um I did want to kind of mention

10
00:00:28,399 --> 00:00:32,640
uh a lot of people wonder what this Long

11
00:00:30,879 --> 00:00:34,359
Island thing is and I did want to

12
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,200
mention that we do have a research

13
00:00:34,359 --> 00:00:38,759
station down in Long Island right in

14
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:41,280
Riverhead on the Eastern portion of Long

15
00:00:38,759 --> 00:00:42,878
Island been there 94 years we're getting

16
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,600
ready to celebrate our 100th anniversary

17
00:00:42,878 --> 00:00:48,359
in about six six more years but we're in

18
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:50,760
suff County here which is the Eastern

19
00:00:48,359 --> 00:00:53,039
almost 2third of the island and we're a

20
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:54,679
very diverse agricultural County most

21
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:56,520
people don't know that so whenever I go

22
00:00:54,679 --> 00:00:57,920
out to speak I like to make sure that

23
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:59,719
the people understand that we have a lot

24
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:01,800
of Agriculture out there and we're

25
00:00:59,719 --> 00:01:04,799
actually actually um a very the leading

26
00:01:01,799 --> 00:01:07,158
county in the state of New York for uh

27
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:09,439
crop agriculture as far as the wholesale

28
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:12,799
value so that's one of the reasons that

29
00:01:09,438 --> 00:01:14,639
Cornell's down there um if you look at

30
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:16,560
the total egg products we're number two

31
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,759
now we used to be number one until about

32
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,159
3 years ago but but still we're number

33
00:01:18,759 --> 00:01:23,079
one for crop agriculture we have uh more

34
00:01:21,159 --> 00:01:25,118
nurseries and more green houses than any

35
00:01:23,078 --> 00:01:27,639
place else in the state in New York uh

36
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:30,159
vegetables were number five other crops

37
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:31,640
like potatoes were number one and ducks

38
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:33,680
and poultry we're still number one so we

39
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:35,439
have a lot of Agriculture and that's

40
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:38,360
that's why we're down in Long

41
00:01:35,438 --> 00:01:40,239
Island and uh we're very fortunate our

42
00:01:38,359 --> 00:01:42,519
Research Center we're the only one in

43
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:44,478
the country that has Specialists for

44
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:46,280
each of the commodity zones we have

45
00:01:44,478 --> 00:01:48,799
floriculture Greenhouse Specialists

46
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:50,159
fruit Specialists particularly in grapes

47
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:52,920
because we have a lot we about 2,000

48
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:54,719
acres of grapes uh vegetable Specialists

49
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:56,560
and then ornamental Specialists and then

50
00:01:54,718 --> 00:01:59,559
we're also very fortunate to have the

51
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:02,200
cross commodity uh specialist two plant

52
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:05,079
path ologist marger is here today A weed

53
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:07,560
scientist two enologists so um we're

54
00:02:05,078 --> 00:02:10,840
kind of a One-Stop shop and in in what

55
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:12,759
TR what is true theoretical extension

56
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:14,479
our stakeholders are about 50 mile

57
00:02:12,759 --> 00:02:16,120
radius from us so we get to interact

58
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:17,439
with them all the time they bring in

59
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:20,159
their diseases and they bring in their

60
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:22,199
insects or we go visit them so um that's

61
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:25,560
what we do down in Long

62
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:27,878
Island and also I uh unlike Paul I'm not

63
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:30,519
a a wildlife specialist I'm I'm a plant

64
00:02:27,878 --> 00:02:33,399
breeder and Greenhouse specialist and as

65
00:02:30,519 --> 00:02:36,080
Margaret had mentioned earlier we um we

66
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:38,400
have been breeding uh with the

67
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:41,480
impatients and as of last year we came

68
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:43,640
up with our first two truly uh Downey

69
00:02:41,479 --> 00:02:46,079
Milo resistant impatients margerie and

70
00:02:43,639 --> 00:02:48,318
her team uh along Island also helped us

71
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,879
was that research uh we're currently

72
00:02:48,318 --> 00:02:52,280
working um Yuki here in the front row is

73
00:02:50,878 --> 00:02:55,359
work going to be working with us for the

74
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:57,239
next several years on um making that a

75
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,959
seed line right now if you were going to

76
00:02:57,239 --> 00:03:02,280
grow this you'd have to propagate it by

77
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:05,479
cuting um also been working with alra

78
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:07,158
Mary for many years on um developing

79
00:03:05,479 --> 00:03:09,238
winter heartiness we have several of

80
00:03:07,158 --> 00:03:11,120
those deer love those by the way so

81
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:13,120
don't grow those if you have deer and

82
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:15,959
then we're also working on a project uh

83
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:18,280
breeding Vitex the chase tree nor um

84
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:19,878
grad student is up there and he's been

85
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:22,280
working on that project so that gives

86
00:03:19,878 --> 00:03:25,120
you a little bit about that

87
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:27,158
but really what we're here to talk about

88
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:30,560
is deer and deer are kind of more my

89
00:03:27,158 --> 00:03:33,560
hobby um because i g i like the garden a

90
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:36,560
lot and so uh I've always lived in areas

91
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:39,120
that have had deer populations so you

92
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,438
know people think that they're very cute

93
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,560
they don't want to sometimes they don't

94
00:03:40,438 --> 00:03:45,560
want to hunt them but um for for us on

95
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:47,840
Long Island deer are a number one

96
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:49,640
problem for Farmers as well as many of

97
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:53,519
the homeowners uh out there that have

98
00:03:49,639 --> 00:03:53,518
nice Gardens so

99
00:03:56,039 --> 00:04:00,598
um you know the original title of this

100
00:03:58,719 --> 00:04:01,959
talk was deer resist resistant plants

101
00:04:00,598 --> 00:04:04,000
but you might have noticed that I

102
00:04:01,959 --> 00:04:06,878
changed it to plants that deer not do

103
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,840
not eat because if you use the term deer

104
00:04:06,878 --> 00:04:10,840
resistant you know there is no plant

105
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:12,640
that's resistant to Deer if a deer wants

106
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:15,719
to bite it and chew it it's going to

107
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:17,358
certainly eat the plant so uh like that

108
00:04:15,719 --> 00:04:18,879
little spruce up there you know deer

109
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:20,879
don't you don't eat the spruce but if

110
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:24,240
they take a bite it's not resistant it's

111
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:27,478
not like iron so so no plant is truly

112
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:29,000
resistant if a deer wants to eat it and

113
00:04:27,478 --> 00:04:30,639
you know we have other problems as Paul

114
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,279
mentioned too you know the rubbing antl

115
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:33,720
so if you do come up with the garden

116
00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:35,758
with all these plants that are resistant

117
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:37,639
to deers then the next the deer the next

118
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:39,680
thing you realize is that in the fall

119
00:04:37,639 --> 00:04:41,918
the male deer come along and they rub

120
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:44,400
the the bark and they girdle the trees

121
00:04:41,918 --> 00:04:46,279
and they kill them that way so you know

122
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:48,239
not only do they eat it then they step

123
00:04:46,279 --> 00:04:50,399
on it you know you'll get all kinds of

124
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,960
physical damage I know our boxwoods at

125
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:54,198
our house have been Dam you know they

126
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:56,359
don't eat deer don't eat boxwoods but

127
00:04:54,199 --> 00:04:58,960
they will uh step on them when they're

128
00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:01,759
trying to reach higher levels of uh

129
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:01,758
plant material to

130
00:05:01,879 --> 00:05:08,399
eat and then they do cosmetic damage um

131
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:11,199
you know this is a classic photo of of

132
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:14,679
arbite Hedges on Long Island they they

133
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:16,840
just get devoured by the deer um and

134
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:19,319
it's um you know they just nibble

135
00:05:16,839 --> 00:05:20,359
everything they can and then the other

136
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,720
part is that you know you're walking

137
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:23,840
through your garden and you stepping on

138
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:28,240
all kinds of little presents that they

139
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:31,239
leave um and uh so that that's not very

140
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:34,439
much fun either

141
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:36,319
well the um Paul kind of mentioned this

142
00:05:34,439 --> 00:05:38,279
earlier but there are a lot of deer in

143
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:42,759
the United States according to a

144
00:05:38,279 --> 00:05:45,038
2014 study uh there's 15 million

145
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:46,759
deer and then as he also mentioned we

146
00:05:45,038 --> 00:05:48,759
have other problems like car accidents

147
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:53,240
Associated this was from the insurance

148
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:56,199
company online um Farmers you know uh

149
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:58,120
have you know immeasurable damage from

150
00:05:56,199 --> 00:05:59,840
the um from the deer and and of course

151
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:01,680
you knows those are hostas so when I say

152
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:04,239
Farmers I include the greenhouse

153
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:06,519
floriculture industry and then lime

154
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,840
disease and all kinds of other diseases

155
00:06:06,519 --> 00:06:09,560
you know the disease now that makes you

156
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:11,159
allergic to meat you've heard about that

157
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:12,879
one right it's a true disease I thought

158
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:14,960
it was I thought it was a fairy tale

159
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:16,399
when I first heard about it but last

160
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:17,799
year we've had so many people that have

161
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:20,239
come down with that disease now that

162
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:22,598
they can't eat any kind of meat protein

163
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:25,598
so you know deer do cause a lot of

164
00:06:22,598 --> 00:06:28,120
problems we put a fence around our farm

165
00:06:25,598 --> 00:06:31,159
we have uh 68 Acres at the Extension

166
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:34,038
Center at a cost about $80,000 we put a

167
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:35,439
fence around the entire farm and uh we'd

168
00:06:34,038 --> 00:06:37,439
be out of business if we didn't have the

169
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:40,759
fence but as Paul mentioned you should

170
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:43,120
be about 8ft fence and then um the fence

171
00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:44,759
and the deer management or hunting are

172
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,800
the only ways you're actually going to

173
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:48,400
truly uh be sure that you're going to

174
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:51,520
get rid of your

175
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:52,918
deer uh Paul also mentioned repellent

176
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:54,478
and you didn't mention Liquid Fence

177
00:06:52,918 --> 00:06:57,639
power surprised cuz this is a really

178
00:06:54,478 --> 00:06:59,639
good this is a really good uh repellent

179
00:06:57,639 --> 00:07:01,840
we have tried this in several situations

180
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:05,199
deer out also these are two that work

181
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:09,719
very well um Liquid Fence smells really

182
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:11,639
really bad badly um so if you spray it

183
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:14,120
before a party people will stay away

184
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:16,280
from your house U on the other hand deer

185
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:18,280
out smells like cloes it's very it's

186
00:07:16,279 --> 00:07:20,679
much more pleasant so uh the other

187
00:07:18,279 --> 00:07:22,598
problem with deer fence is that it's a

188
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:24,240
very thick mixture so when you put it in

189
00:07:22,598 --> 00:07:26,719
a spray bottle it really clogs up the

190
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:28,319
spray bottle quickly so but they both

191
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:33,280
work uh

192
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:33,280
dependably I have a question on that

193
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:43,879
sure

194
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:50,560
Amell well I've heard people say that uh

195
00:07:48,598 --> 00:07:52,560
but we do have a a nursery landscape

196
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:54,280
environments in Long Island which is in

197
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,680
match New York they have beautiful

198
00:07:54,279 --> 00:07:59,038
gardens that are uh subject to deer

199
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:02,000
attack and they they consistently spray

200
00:07:59,038 --> 00:08:03,399
with one uh every week and that's the

201
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
other thing that we didn't mention

202
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:07,399
earlier Paul didn't mentioned is that

203
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:11,079
when he he did that study uh he sprayed

204
00:08:07,399 --> 00:08:14,000
once and then saw how things um were

205
00:08:11,079 --> 00:08:15,478
repelled for several months later but if

206
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,560
you're in a homeowner situation you

207
00:08:15,478 --> 00:08:19,839
should you should reapply you know

208
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:22,680
because they will wash off deer will get

209
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:26,038
you know the smell will get less um you

210
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:27,879
know unpleasant to the deer so um I I

211
00:08:26,038 --> 00:08:30,000
don't think there's any there's I don't

212
00:08:27,879 --> 00:08:31,800
think there's any problem to rotating

213
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,759
back and forth from one to the other but

214
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:35,200
I don't think you necessarily need to

215
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:40,158
because we've tried areas with just

216
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:40,158
Liquid Fence and just deer it was fine

217
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:46,518
yese I'm not sure what's what's in here

218
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,519
uh but it smells really

219
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:50,639
bad so

220
00:08:57,759 --> 00:09:02,720
some oh uh the question I think what the

221
00:09:00,559 --> 00:09:07,119
question is is do I find that these work

222
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:09,560
for buck rubbing also um not really not

223
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:11,360
really uh we use fences I think I'll

224
00:09:09,559 --> 00:09:12,879
show well in just a couple slides I'll

225
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,360
show you that there's different ways we

226
00:09:12,879 --> 00:09:16,600
avoid we're going to talk about plants

227
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:18,759
but there's other ways you can do it and

228
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:20,320
and one is just to elevate your plants

229
00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:21,639
okay as a homeowner we can do this of

230
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,480
course in a commercial business you

231
00:09:21,639 --> 00:09:25,319
can't these are all pictures from my

232
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:27,480
house but you can see we put window

233
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:30,519
boxes in where they can't reach uh but I

234
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:32,320
will say this little uh

235
00:09:30,519 --> 00:09:34,200
little walkway in between the house and

236
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,959
the garage they have come into there and

237
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:39,120
eaten our plants in there so there's no

238
00:09:35,958 --> 00:09:41,599
guarantees but you know the we um use

239
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:43,720
hanging the window boxes we use hanging

240
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:46,759
baskets uh where they can't reach and

241
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:48,519
then even on our Hen House um we put a a

242
00:09:46,759 --> 00:09:53,278
green roof onp on top of the hand house

243
00:09:48,519 --> 00:09:53,278
just to make them mad you know cuz they

244
00:09:54,759 --> 00:09:59,720
can't and the Hand House serves dual

245
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:01,640
purpose because not only uh is a place

246
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:04,160
for the chickens to live but we let them

247
00:10:01,639 --> 00:10:05,559
out at night and they eat ticks so you

248
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:07,919
know T the chickens are very good at

249
00:10:05,559 --> 00:10:09,319
tick elimination but they don't get them

250
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:12,120
all because I will tell you I get every

251
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:14,480
day I'm out in the garden I get a tick

252
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:16,519
so any the other one is defense your

253
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:19,039
plants uh Paul mentioned that too but on

254
00:10:16,519 --> 00:10:20,600
a homeowner situation we do that we

255
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:22,480
fence them in it looks really ugly but

256
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:23,800
if you want to road to dendron on Long

257
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,639
Island you better fence it or else it's

258
00:10:23,799 --> 00:10:28,240
going to be eaten typically what we do

259
00:10:25,639 --> 00:10:30,240
this is a Storia that is fenced in it

260
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,560
was a very it was kind of a present and

261
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:34,720
had sentimental meetings to us so we

262
00:10:31,559 --> 00:10:37,319
fenced it in but this just this year um

263
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:38,879
it's been big enough thick enough that I

264
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:41,320
don't think the the deer are going to

265
00:10:38,879 --> 00:10:42,759
rub it and when they start eating the

266
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:45,320
lower part that's okay they can eat the

267
00:10:42,759 --> 00:10:47,480
lower part and we'll enjoy the top part

268
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:49,680
but U and it's also surrounded by

269
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:51,959
Bayberry which is one of my plants that

270
00:10:49,679 --> 00:10:53,638
I'm going to be talking about and uh

271
00:10:51,958 --> 00:10:56,518
when deer go to rub they like to have a

272
00:10:53,639 --> 00:10:58,079
clear uh approach entrance so with the

273
00:10:56,519 --> 00:11:00,639
Bayberry I hope that is also going to

274
00:10:58,078 --> 00:11:01,879
kind of deter them

275
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:04,000
but we're what we're going to talk about

276
00:11:01,879 --> 00:11:05,600
today is choosing the right plants uh

277
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,360
for the garden because you can have a

278
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:11,600
beautiful garden uh in spite of the

279
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:13,039
plant in spite of the Deer uh situation

280
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,759
uh this is another picture from my

281
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:18,319
garden uh we have a lot of deer as as I

282
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:21,078
was amazed when Paul said 250 per per

283
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:24,399
square mile most of them are in my yard

284
00:11:21,078 --> 00:11:26,958
I'm sure so

285
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:28,679
um and I also want to say I have a lot

286
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:31,278
of faith in this this list you should

287
00:11:28,679 --> 00:11:33,278
have I passed out or Neil had passed out

288
00:11:31,278 --> 00:11:35,720
the list to you all you know I have a

289
00:11:33,278 --> 00:11:37,679
lot of faith in that list and you'll

290
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:39,800
notice that on the list that we have the

291
00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:42,519
asterisk plants those are what I call my

292
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:45,039
95% plants that means 95% of the time

293
00:11:42,519 --> 00:11:46,839
the deer won't touch it but the reason

294
00:11:45,039 --> 00:11:48,399
we have faith in our list is that we've

295
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:50,880
actually done this in a scientific

296
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:53,399
manner we've replicated these plants in

297
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:56,639
different locations that have deer

298
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:59,078
pressure uh under control situations the

299
00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:01,159
the the deer so to speak so I used used

300
00:11:59,078 --> 00:12:03,278
to live in Connecticut for 18 years we

301
00:12:01,159 --> 00:12:06,039
had Gardens there that had a lot of deer

302
00:12:03,278 --> 00:12:09,159
then we moved to Long Island and um so

303
00:12:06,039 --> 00:12:11,838
we've replicated these and um I feel

304
00:12:09,159 --> 00:12:14,078
very confident about this list U because

305
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:16,440
my wife and I Margot we we both like to

306
00:12:14,078 --> 00:12:18,919
Garden so we Garden a lot and in our

307
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:20,839
situation we have a sun Garden where we

308
00:12:18,919 --> 00:12:22,399
can test sun plants and then we have a

309
00:12:20,839 --> 00:12:25,399
shade garden Woodland Garden where we

310
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:27,559
can do woodland plants and um so we do

311
00:12:25,399 --> 00:12:29,159
replicate uh we have great situations

312
00:12:27,559 --> 00:12:30,799
like one year marjerie was doing a study

313
00:12:29,159 --> 00:12:32,120
with junipers and she had these junipers

314
00:12:30,799 --> 00:12:33,879
left over and she said you want to use

315
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:35,919
these for deer oh this is great so I

316
00:12:33,879 --> 00:12:37,639
took all these plants home and I spread

317
00:12:35,919 --> 00:12:39,559
them around so we have uh different

318
00:12:37,639 --> 00:12:41,560
locations on the property to make sure

319
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:45,838
that the deer had access to them and we

320
00:12:41,559 --> 00:12:47,719
able we were able to judge them um so uh

321
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:50,160
that's I just want to say that's why we

322
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:52,879
feel very confident about this

323
00:12:50,159 --> 00:12:54,159
list now people always say this to me

324
00:12:52,879 --> 00:12:55,519
when I speak at groups around the

325
00:12:54,159 --> 00:12:56,838
country they're going to say well if a

326
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:59,480
deer is hungry enough they're going to

327
00:12:56,839 --> 00:13:02,800
eat anything okay

328
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:05,759
and you know there are certain plants

329
00:13:02,799 --> 00:13:07,359
that are really poisonous okay these are

330
00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:09,519
three plants I'll talk about the Fox

331
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:11,278
Glove the tour the the monks SW they're

332
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:13,440
very poisonous plant if we ate those

333
00:13:11,278 --> 00:13:16,000
plants we'd be dead if deer ate those

334
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:19,360
plants they'd be dead so they don't eat

335
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:21,240
you know this is not completely true um

336
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,959
but I will believe what Paul said Paul

337
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:25,079
said that if you have such a high

338
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:27,518
pressure and that they're starving to

339
00:13:25,078 --> 00:13:29,319
death they'll probably eat some of these

340
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:31,078
things I haven't seen

341
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:35,240
but you know Long Island Connecticut

342
00:13:31,078 --> 00:13:37,278
isn't really a situation where um there

343
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:39,799
are a lot other Gardens to go to and

344
00:13:37,278 --> 00:13:41,320
they they can eat other plants so what

345
00:13:39,799 --> 00:13:42,719
I'm going to do today I can't obviously

346
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:45,040
talk about all the plants on your list

347
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,519
because we only have a half an hour but

348
00:13:45,039 --> 00:13:48,278
um but I want to talk about some of the

349
00:13:46,519 --> 00:13:49,600
annuals and I'm going to talk about some

350
00:13:48,278 --> 00:13:51,078
of the herbaceous perennials actually

351
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,519
more herbaceous perennials because this

352
00:13:51,078 --> 00:13:54,039
group is more interested in that and

353
00:13:52,519 --> 00:13:55,919
then some of the Woodies and we'll just

354
00:13:54,039 --> 00:13:57,360
talk until the time's up Neil you have

355
00:13:55,919 --> 00:13:59,198
to stop me when my time's up I'll just

356
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,560
stop because then this afternoon when

357
00:13:59,198 --> 00:14:02,479
we're out of Bluegrass Lane we'll walk

358
00:14:00,559 --> 00:14:04,000
through the The Trial Gardens out there

359
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:05,800
their perennial gardens and we'll talk

360
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,000
more about perennials then I mean I'm

361
00:14:05,799 --> 00:14:10,399
sorry about plants that are resistant to

362
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,720
deer and feel free to yell out any

363
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:15,159
questions you have as I go along but

364
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:17,879
clomi are one of these plants I think is

365
00:14:15,159 --> 00:14:19,799
if those of you who are Growers or have

366
00:14:17,879 --> 00:14:22,919
nurseries you've probably seen this

367
00:14:19,799 --> 00:14:25,159
plant quite popular in recent years uh

368
00:14:22,919 --> 00:14:26,679
particularly some of the new new

369
00:14:25,159 --> 00:14:28,958
cultivars that have been released the

370
00:14:26,679 --> 00:14:31,439
clomi Rosalita for example a lot of that

371
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:33,319
is being grown um probably not because

372
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:35,040
it's deer resistant but it is quite deer

373
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:37,160
resistant but because it's short it's

374
00:14:35,039 --> 00:14:40,198
compact it's very floriferous that's a

375
00:14:37,159 --> 00:14:44,719
nice plant but any of the clei or spider

376
00:14:40,198 --> 00:14:46,799
flowers uh do well um they're annuals um

377
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:49,800
these the Rosalita sterile so it won't

378
00:14:46,799 --> 00:14:52,240
recede itself but these other the the

379
00:14:49,799 --> 00:14:53,838
cleoma will recede itself and it will

380
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:55,720
act as a perennial so even though it's

381
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:57,680
an annual it will continue to come up

382
00:14:55,720 --> 00:15:00,920
for you every

383
00:14:57,679 --> 00:15:03,838
year um a lot of people don't try the

384
00:15:00,919 --> 00:15:05,479
cocases or or the alasas uh because

385
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:08,639
they're kind of expensive you know each

386
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:12,839
one of those those corns was about $10

387
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:15,198
$12 on Long Island $25 no no no they're

388
00:15:12,839 --> 00:15:16,880
about $10 on Long Island to but they're

389
00:15:15,198 --> 00:15:17,719
kind of pricey but that's okay you know

390
00:15:16,879 --> 00:15:19,519
because you can put them out in your

391
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:21,120
garden enjoy them for the summer and

392
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:23,320
actually dig them up I dig up all mine

393
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:25,198
in the in the fall uh it's very easy

394
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:27,278
once they frosted down I just cut them

395
00:15:25,198 --> 00:15:29,159
off dig them out Shake all the soil and

396
00:15:27,278 --> 00:15:33,278
then throw them in my basement but

397
00:15:29,159 --> 00:15:35,198
uh it's it's not uh doesn't freeze and

398
00:15:33,278 --> 00:15:37,399
and they just they dry all all winter

399
00:15:35,198 --> 00:15:39,120
and then in the spring I take them plant

400
00:15:37,399 --> 00:15:41,799
them outside and they do fine so even

401
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:44,720
though expensive they they do work well

402
00:15:41,799 --> 00:15:46,799
um the alocasia the same way uh kind of

403
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:50,600
a nicer showy plant the leaves the

404
00:15:46,799 --> 00:15:53,599
foliage is more upright in this case um

405
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:57,600
but uh annual plants uh they don't F

406
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:59,199
they just offer that foliage kind of uh

407
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:01,759
attractiveness

408
00:15:59,198 --> 00:16:04,879
neosan is an interesting plant uh this

409
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:07,399
is noos sylvestris it has the white

410
00:16:04,879 --> 00:16:09,159
plant we've tried other nanas the little

411
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:12,278
noos the little tobacco that are so

412
00:16:09,159 --> 00:16:13,958
popular other species it seems to be

413
00:16:12,278 --> 00:16:16,039
that this is the only species that

414
00:16:13,958 --> 00:16:18,838
actually is resistant they won't touch

415
00:16:16,039 --> 00:16:20,519
this plant and other tobacco that we've

416
00:16:18,839 --> 00:16:23,160
tried and tried several times they will

417
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:26,240
eat uh so I don't quite understand that

418
00:16:23,159 --> 00:16:28,318
but this is what what we've noticed uh

419
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:32,198
this is another one of those annuals

420
00:16:28,318 --> 00:16:34,240
that uh that will recede itself and come

421
00:16:32,198 --> 00:16:35,838
up year after year as as a perennial so

422
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:38,720
if you want this PL it's a tall plant it

423
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:41,519
gets it's tall and showy and U really

424
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:43,160
nice in gardens and this is a plant that

425
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:46,278
does well in full sun and also does well

426
00:16:43,159 --> 00:16:46,278
in in a partial shade

427
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:52,600
situation the penum are are really nice

428
00:16:49,639 --> 00:16:54,240
uh ornamental grasses um I think I might

429
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:56,519
talk about another ornamental grass

430
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:59,360
later yes later on in the in the

431
00:16:56,519 --> 00:17:02,799
presentation even though I haven't

432
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:06,160
uh trout every grass that there is I

433
00:17:02,799 --> 00:17:08,639
would be willing to to say that probably

434
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:10,160
every grass every ornamental grass is

435
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:12,120
resistant to Deer I've never seen

436
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:14,160
grasses eaten by deer the purple

437
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:16,519
fountain grass is really pretty it's an

438
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:20,038
annual you can see you can really make

439
00:17:16,519 --> 00:17:22,199
some nice um designs with colas and

440
00:17:20,038 --> 00:17:24,558
other kinds of uh alasas and other

441
00:17:22,199 --> 00:17:27,360
things to make a nice pot or even a nice

442
00:17:24,558 --> 00:17:30,079
section in your garden uh but these you

443
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:32,439
do need to to repurchase because they

444
00:17:30,079 --> 00:17:32,439
they are

445
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:37,279
annuals okay so those were my annuals

446
00:17:35,119 --> 00:17:38,918
just there other ones on your list let's

447
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:41,240
move into the herbaceous perennials I

448
00:17:38,919 --> 00:17:44,559
mentioned earlier that the monkswood one

449
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:47,120
of the most poisonous plants there is

450
00:17:44,558 --> 00:17:48,759
um every part of that plant's poisonous

451
00:17:47,119 --> 00:17:51,359
from the the flowers to the leaves to

452
00:17:48,759 --> 00:17:55,119
the roots and deer tend to stay away

453
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:58,399
from it um I should also mention

454
00:17:55,119 --> 00:18:01,678
that some plants that are resistant will

455
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:03,919
occasionally get nibbled on so like this

456
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:07,960
particular plant I have several of these

457
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:10,320
in our Gardens and I noticed that that

458
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:12,200
at one point there was the tops were

459
00:18:10,319 --> 00:18:14,000
nibbled off you have to remember that

460
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:15,519
your deer deer population may be

461
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,558
changing particularly in the spring when

462
00:18:15,519 --> 00:18:19,839
you have all the baby deer you know the

463
00:18:17,558 --> 00:18:23,720
young fawns walking through they have

464
00:18:19,839 --> 00:18:25,839
not let Ur not yet learned that these

465
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:28,759
plants are poisonous or don't taste well

466
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:30,798
so they'll they'll take a little nibble

467
00:18:28,759 --> 00:18:32,879
and then you know of course they damage

468
00:18:30,798 --> 00:18:34,319
your plant uh but they're not going to

469
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:36,360
eat the whole plants they won't be back

470
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:39,399
after that after they take their first

471
00:18:36,359 --> 00:18:42,959
taste um they usually leave the plant

472
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:46,519
alone agastache very dependable plants

473
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:48,840
uh this was also on con's list for for

474
00:18:46,519 --> 00:18:50,839
pollinators um this is a very hearty

475
00:18:48,839 --> 00:18:53,720
peral it smells very nice it might be

476
00:18:50,839 --> 00:18:56,399
the fragrance that these leaves um give

477
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:57,960
off they keep the deer away uh a lot of

478
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:00,159
pollinators go to these plants too I

479
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:03,200
will say say though if you grow this

480
00:19:00,159 --> 00:19:05,080
plant um it is I don't want to use the I

481
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:06,759
word the invasive word but it will

482
00:19:05,079 --> 00:19:08,279
spread a lot in your garden so you have

483
00:19:06,759 --> 00:19:11,440
to be careful about that it comes up

484
00:19:08,279 --> 00:19:14,879
here and there but a great plant you can

485
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:14,880
get in purples and whites and

486
00:19:15,119 --> 00:19:21,038
blues uh the aliums uh are very

487
00:19:18,079 --> 00:19:24,038
resistant to the Deer U it always kinds

488
00:19:21,038 --> 00:19:25,919
of surprised me that um plants like this

489
00:19:24,038 --> 00:19:28,879
which we eat you know we find as

490
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:32,960
culinary plants the deer won't eat

491
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:35,320
so um they don't touch it uh the garlic

492
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:36,919
chives are interesting however the

493
00:19:35,319 --> 00:19:38,678
garlic chives for us down on Long Island

494
00:19:36,919 --> 00:19:39,799
are just starting to bud that's the part

495
00:19:38,679 --> 00:19:41,280
actually that you would e if you're

496
00:19:39,798 --> 00:19:43,119
going to use it in cooking you know

497
00:19:41,279 --> 00:19:44,480
before the flowers actually open you

498
00:19:43,119 --> 00:19:46,959
know when they're more in this this

499
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:49,279
bud-like stage here that's when you cut

500
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:51,798
them to put them into different kinds of

501
00:19:49,279 --> 00:19:53,558
eggs or whatever you're cooking I will

502
00:19:51,798 --> 00:19:55,918
have noticed that the deer if they do

503
00:19:53,558 --> 00:19:58,279
eat this plant they will eat it when the

504
00:19:55,919 --> 00:20:01,280
the buds are coming out uh not

505
00:19:58,279 --> 00:20:04,158
frequently but they will do

506
00:20:01,279 --> 00:20:07,599
that blue star which is a native plant

507
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:10,440
the amsonia T Montana um this is kind of

508
00:20:07,599 --> 00:20:12,038
a plant that is um promoted as a shade

509
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:14,200
plant it also does quite well in full

510
00:20:12,038 --> 00:20:17,480
sun uh this is a plant that flowers

511
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:19,759
early in the summer and

512
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:21,679
um usually what I do with this plant

513
00:20:19,759 --> 00:20:23,279
after it flowers I just cut it all the

514
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:25,200
way down to the ground and it will come

515
00:20:23,279 --> 00:20:27,399
back in the summer thicker and nicer and

516
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:30,440
it gives you a nice thick green uh kind

517
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:30,440
of bushy kind of

518
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:36,000
plant all the Aromas we've tested um

519
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:38,280
well probably not every species of

520
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:41,599
aresia but we've tried tried many of the

521
00:20:38,279 --> 00:20:43,798
emesia and they all been resistant uh to

522
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:47,240
it the uh to the

523
00:20:43,798 --> 00:20:49,279
deer the um like plants like the

524
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:51,839
Tangerine southernwood not a

525
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:53,519
particularly attractive plant um it has

526
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:55,759
a place in the garden but it doesn't

527
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:57,359
really flower and it doesn't really do

528
00:20:55,759 --> 00:20:59,119
much it doesn't even have that light

529
00:20:57,359 --> 00:21:01,639
white color that that the other species

530
00:20:59,119 --> 00:21:03,759
have up here but um the deer won't eat

531
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:07,360
it and uh the

532
00:21:03,759 --> 00:21:08,839
arimas um like ludoviciana white sage is

533
00:21:07,359 --> 00:21:10,038
a very aggressive grower if you have it

534
00:21:08,839 --> 00:21:13,439
in your garden it's going to spread

535
00:21:10,038 --> 00:21:15,759
quite a bit uh Shiana just um it's just

536
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:18,400
the opposite it kind of barely survives

537
00:21:15,759 --> 00:21:21,400
the winter sometimes Palace Castle I

538
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:23,640
love pal Castle um very dependable in

539
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:27,320
the garden that's one of those plants

540
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:29,559
that um when it in the winter time

541
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:32,079
there'll be some Dam on it but it rarely

542
00:21:29,558 --> 00:21:33,639
will that plant die it just will maybe

543
00:21:32,079 --> 00:21:36,119
just sections of it will die and it will

544
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:38,720
come back so uh but it's it's a great

545
00:21:36,119 --> 00:21:40,278
plant to give you some of that um fine

546
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:43,558
textures from the foliage as well as

547
00:21:40,278 --> 00:21:43,558
that light colored

548
00:21:44,278 --> 00:21:50,960
leaves the esclipus this was a a one of

549
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:53,839
those those plants that I was just so

550
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:58,038
surprised we were U maybe about 10 years

551
00:21:53,839 --> 00:22:00,558
ago sitting in a friend of ours uh back

552
00:21:58,038 --> 00:22:03,278
backyard having a drink or whatever and

553
00:22:00,558 --> 00:22:05,639
he had a field just a an empty field

554
00:22:03,278 --> 00:22:07,159
next to his property and you know we

555
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:09,360
could see the deer walking through the

556
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:10,919
field and you know the conversation

557
00:22:09,359 --> 00:22:12,918
always goes around Deer and then I

558
00:22:10,919 --> 00:22:14,200
noticed that the butterfly weed was just

559
00:22:12,919 --> 00:22:16,640
all over that

560
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:18,480
field so I thought why aren't those deer

561
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:21,200
eating those butterfly weed so we tried

562
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:24,480
this and they're resistant the deer

563
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:26,480
won't touch this plant and it's very

564
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:28,400
very pretty Garden or ornamental just

565
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:30,558
primarily in the orange color but you

566
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:32,960
can try the other species uh both of

567
00:22:30,558 --> 00:22:34,639
these are belong to that category for

568
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:37,880
the pollinator Gardens particularly

569
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:40,320
butterfly gardens so the uh the milkweed

570
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:41,880
also uh a plant that you don't see too

571
00:22:40,319 --> 00:22:44,319
frequently in gardens but you should see

572
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:47,919
more of because the deer won't touch it

573
00:22:44,319 --> 00:22:47,918
and they are good for for the

574
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:53,120
pollinators Kela uh particular this

575
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:54,360
white cloud I don't know if you've seen

576
00:22:53,119 --> 00:22:55,839
that some of you sell this plant the

577
00:22:54,359 --> 00:22:59,000
White Cloud it's really a spectacular

578
00:22:55,839 --> 00:23:00,759
little plant um blooms quite a lot uh

579
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,880
very easy to propagate if you're into

580
00:23:00,759 --> 00:23:04,079
propagating your own plants uh you could

581
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:05,919
probably just take a cutting the throat

582
00:23:04,079 --> 00:23:09,000
in the ground and it would root for you

583
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:10,799
so uh very interesting grower very uh

584
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:13,079
aggressive grower because it's in that

585
00:23:10,798 --> 00:23:16,480
mint family which are so easy to grow

586
00:23:13,079 --> 00:23:18,199
and so dependable so try the Cintas if

587
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:20,319
you haven't tried

588
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:22,640
those again this is one of those plants

589
00:23:20,319 --> 00:23:23,399
like the grasses I would be willing to

590
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:26,640
you

591
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:28,600
know say without actually having tested

592
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:30,520
all the car species I would be willing

593
00:23:28,599 --> 00:23:34,359
to say that these are probably all

594
00:23:30,519 --> 00:23:36,440
resistant to Deer um this you know this

595
00:23:34,359 --> 00:23:38,558
weeping Brown Sage it's no wonder cu the

596
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:40,919
deer probably think it's dead you know

597
00:23:38,558 --> 00:23:42,918
cuz it does look like a dead plant but

598
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:46,440
uh the cars are Dependable plants the

599
00:23:42,919 --> 00:23:48,480
deer stay away from um there will be

600
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:49,600
occasional nibbling I think this is one

601
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,919
of the plants that they're trying to

602
00:23:49,599 --> 00:23:53,079
test to see if they like it but they

603
00:23:50,919 --> 00:23:55,640
usually stay away from this

604
00:23:53,079 --> 00:23:58,359
plant Fox glub one of my favorites you

605
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:59,600
know it's a it's a true banal but it it

606
00:23:58,359 --> 00:24:01,399
like some of the other plants will act

607
00:23:59,599 --> 00:24:03,798
as a perennial because it will recede

608
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:07,440
itself and keep coming up if you have a

609
00:24:03,798 --> 00:24:09,440
garden that you don't mind u a little uh

610
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:10,880
I say messiness this is a plant when it

611
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:12,480
recedes it comes up here and there you

612
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:14,360
know it's not in the same location every

613
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:16,519
year but looks really nice if you have a

614
00:24:14,359 --> 00:24:18,519
natural looking garden and don't forget

615
00:24:16,519 --> 00:24:20,679
that there is a yellow form of the

616
00:24:18,519 --> 00:24:23,079
digitalis the Fox Glove Grand Flo it's a

617
00:24:20,679 --> 00:24:25,000
little shorter has a yellow flow and

618
00:24:23,079 --> 00:24:28,119
deer stay away from that one

619
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:29,960
too but very poisonous you know this is

620
00:24:28,119 --> 00:24:31,759
the plant that they make digitoxin from

621
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:33,038
so if any of you take heart medicine

622
00:24:31,759 --> 00:24:36,038
this is the plant that they make that

623
00:24:33,038 --> 00:24:37,839
from so if you if you chew on the leaves

624
00:24:36,038 --> 00:24:40,319
don't chew on the leaves but if but if

625
00:24:37,839 --> 00:24:43,240
you did your your heart would do a

626
00:24:40,319 --> 00:24:45,519
little palpitations

627
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:47,839
there euphorbia is another group of

628
00:24:45,519 --> 00:24:49,558
plant that the deer stay away from um

629
00:24:47,839 --> 00:24:51,278
we've tried many kinds many of the

630
00:24:49,558 --> 00:24:53,678
species of euphorbias and they seem to

631
00:24:51,278 --> 00:24:56,000
all be uh resistant to the deer or the

632
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:57,798
deer stay away from them um it's no

633
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,839
wonder you know a lot of the euphoria

634
00:24:57,798 --> 00:25:01,558
kind of are toxic you know people say

635
00:24:59,839 --> 00:25:03,918
for years that poinsettas were poisonous

636
00:25:01,558 --> 00:25:06,319
they're not but uh these are some of

637
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:08,159
them are very bad like the donkey tail

638
00:25:06,319 --> 00:25:10,038
spurge this is one of my my favorite

639
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:11,919
ones because it does get its flower

640
00:25:10,038 --> 00:25:13,359
earlier in the summer with that yellow

641
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:15,480
you know just when you need some color

642
00:25:13,359 --> 00:25:16,959
in the Gard you get that yellow flowers

643
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:20,919
and then all summer long you get the

644
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:23,319
blue green gray foliage um but this is a

645
00:25:20,919 --> 00:25:25,399
plant all the euphorbias really that you

646
00:25:23,319 --> 00:25:27,480
should be aware of that when you when

647
00:25:25,398 --> 00:25:31,278
you're pruning them or taking cuting

648
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:32,558
they do produce that sap and uh several

649
00:25:31,278 --> 00:25:34,679
people are allergic to that they'll

650
00:25:32,558 --> 00:25:36,200
break out into skin rash so if you're

651
00:25:34,679 --> 00:25:38,038
out gardening with those and you know

652
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:41,480
that your Skin's getting red and itchy

653
00:25:38,038 --> 00:25:41,480
it might be because of that

654
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:46,558
plant and one of my favorites the helbor

655
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:48,079
if you need a plant for deep shade our

656
00:25:46,558 --> 00:25:51,519
Woodland Garden we have this everywhere

657
00:25:48,079 --> 00:25:53,038
the helbor are everywhere and um we've

658
00:25:51,519 --> 00:25:55,918
been finding with this plant that they

659
00:25:53,038 --> 00:25:58,759
do set their own seeds and they will you

660
00:25:55,919 --> 00:26:00,559
you know uh repopulate their the forest

661
00:25:58,759 --> 00:26:02,798
with just seedlings so we have these

662
00:26:00,558 --> 00:26:05,119
everywhere the deer never touched these

663
00:26:02,798 --> 00:26:06,000
plants uh lots of different colors now

664
00:26:05,119 --> 00:26:08,239
that are

665
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,200
available and If you haven't tried these

666
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:11,359
try these if you get them bu seedlings

667
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:13,880
of course they're going to take a couple

668
00:26:11,359 --> 00:26:15,639
years before they flower uh sometimes up

669
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:18,880
to three but if you buy them in from

670
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:18,880
plugs you're probably looking at two

671
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:26,480
years Lamey asum this is not one of my

672
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:28,278
95% plants um the the yellow Archangel

673
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:29,599
uh because the deer will come around in

674
00:26:28,278 --> 00:26:31,798
this very early spring and they'll

675
00:26:29,599 --> 00:26:34,000
nibble the plants usually right before

676
00:26:31,798 --> 00:26:35,918
they set right after they set bud so you

677
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:38,558
don't get the flour but you will keep

678
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:41,840
the the the foliage this cultivar

679
00:26:38,558 --> 00:26:44,000
Herman's Pride however uh the deer tend

680
00:26:41,839 --> 00:26:45,759
to stay away from it that's more clumpy

681
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,839
it's not it's not a trailer it's more of

682
00:26:45,759 --> 00:26:51,398
a clumpy plant and um the deer don't

683
00:26:48,839 --> 00:26:53,720
seem to like that one as much as the

684
00:26:51,398 --> 00:26:56,158
regular true species I'm not sure why

685
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:59,240
but that's that's what

686
00:26:56,159 --> 00:27:00,799
happens it's c lamium lamium and

687
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:02,679
lamiastrum they used to be the same

688
00:27:00,798 --> 00:27:04,839
genus but then taxonomist realized that

689
00:27:02,679 --> 00:27:07,200
they were two different plants lamium

690
00:27:04,839 --> 00:27:10,359
are even more dependable than the lame

691
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:12,120
AUM rarely do you see plants uh deer

692
00:27:10,359 --> 00:27:15,639
excuse me rarely do you see deer eating

693
00:27:12,119 --> 00:27:17,798
these plants um and this is a good shade

694
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:19,919
plant it also does okay in full sun but

695
00:27:17,798 --> 00:27:22,119
it's mostly a shade plant and as you can

696
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:24,240
tell just from these cultivars you can

697
00:27:22,119 --> 00:27:28,278
get a lot of flower variety you can also

698
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:30,599
get a lot of foliage diversity and um so

699
00:27:28,278 --> 00:27:33,159
there you can have all kinds of

700
00:27:30,599 --> 00:27:35,759
cultivars in your garden and do very

701
00:27:33,159 --> 00:27:35,760
nicely with

702
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:42,120
this lavenders um you know are one of

703
00:27:39,759 --> 00:27:44,480
the very most popular plants stay de do

704
00:27:42,119 --> 00:27:45,959
stay away from this um we have some

705
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:47,839
Lavender Fields on the Eastern end of

706
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:50,640
Long Island that people come in and

707
00:27:47,839 --> 00:27:54,158
they'll they'll pay $8.50 just to walk

708
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:55,399
through the lavender field and um this

709
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:57,120
time of year they're blooming and then

710
00:27:55,398 --> 00:28:00,558
they have once the flowers dry out they

711
00:27:57,119 --> 00:28:02,239
sell the the dried flowers people always

712
00:28:00,558 --> 00:28:03,519
complain about this plant dying in the

713
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:05,880
garden but you have to remember with

714
00:28:03,519 --> 00:28:07,759
lavenders they're one of the last things

715
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:10,320
to come out in the spring because they

716
00:28:07,759 --> 00:28:11,359
do get Woody stems and people will

717
00:28:10,319 --> 00:28:12,278
they'll be out in the garden other

718
00:28:11,359 --> 00:28:13,719
things are going to be growing and

719
00:28:12,278 --> 00:28:16,159
they'll look at the lavender and they'll

720
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:17,880
th they'll think that the plant is dead

721
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:20,679
but don't you know just be patient with

722
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:23,679
that plant it will probably Leaf out for

723
00:28:20,679 --> 00:28:26,600
you but the foliage is great in uh you

724
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:28,759
know that gray green color the ligular

725
00:28:26,599 --> 00:28:32,558
lots of ligular to use these are also

726
00:28:28,759 --> 00:28:34,398
shade plants um you can you know they do

727
00:28:32,558 --> 00:28:36,839
very dependably they don't like to dry

728
00:28:34,398 --> 00:28:38,278
out um in our garden we don't we don't

729
00:28:36,839 --> 00:28:40,839
have irrigation other than when I'm out

730
00:28:38,278 --> 00:28:42,558
there with a hose so um when they're dry

731
00:28:40,839 --> 00:28:45,000
they'll just go flat but they do kind of

732
00:28:42,558 --> 00:28:48,119
pop back um interesting kind of

733
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:49,919
yellowish flowers that othell has that

734
00:28:48,119 --> 00:28:52,359
orange yellow flower I'm not sure if I

735
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:54,440
like that color but um that's about the

736
00:28:52,359 --> 00:28:56,398
only colors that you can get with these

737
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:58,640
with this particular

738
00:28:56,398 --> 00:29:00,639
genus

739
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:02,759
mints all the mints this is another

740
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:05,200
example where where we as humans eat

741
00:29:02,759 --> 00:29:08,158
mints or we use them in drinks like

742
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:10,679
moito time and um but the deer won't

743
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:12,120
touch them okay don't you wish that they

744
00:29:10,679 --> 00:29:14,399
kind of ate some of these plants cuz

745
00:29:12,119 --> 00:29:16,359
they're so invasive they spread

746
00:29:14,398 --> 00:29:17,759
everywhere if you do grow the mints you

747
00:29:16,359 --> 00:29:19,359
might want to put them into a pot

748
00:29:17,759 --> 00:29:21,200
because once they're in the ground

749
00:29:19,359 --> 00:29:23,359
they're

750
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:26,759
everywhere and as Paul mentioned the

751
00:29:23,359 --> 00:29:30,000
daffodils all the daffodils are uh are

752
00:29:26,759 --> 00:29:31,558
justlike by the deer for some reason um

753
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,398
but you will notice some people say to

754
00:29:31,558 --> 00:29:35,079
me oh you know my daffodils have been

755
00:29:33,398 --> 00:29:38,239
nibbled by the deer well remember when

756
00:29:35,079 --> 00:29:39,678
the when the daffodils are flying early

757
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:41,278
summer or late spring whatever you want

758
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:43,759
to call it you know there are babies

759
00:29:41,278 --> 00:29:45,159
around their baby fawns or there's they

760
00:29:43,759 --> 00:29:47,038
may be extremely hungry after that

761
00:29:45,159 --> 00:29:48,600
winter and they're going to taste taste

762
00:29:47,038 --> 00:29:50,679
those buds but once they find out that

763
00:29:48,599 --> 00:29:53,798
they don't like them they leave them

764
00:29:50,679 --> 00:29:55,559
alone the catnips the cat mints are

765
00:29:53,798 --> 00:29:58,158
Dependable deer will stay away from

766
00:29:55,558 --> 00:30:01,000
these plants uh they get beautiful blue

767
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:03,240
flowers in early summer uh nice bushy

768
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,720
plants Dependable this is a plant very

769
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:06,359
similar to the blue star that once it's

770
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:07,919
done blooming just I just whack the

771
00:30:06,359 --> 00:30:10,319
thing back and it's going to flower for

772
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:12,038
you a second time in the summer uh very

773
00:30:10,319 --> 00:30:14,519
nice plant a little aggressive this too

774
00:30:12,038 --> 00:30:16,960
will recede and come up different places

775
00:30:14,519 --> 00:30:19,558
um and if you have cats some nice little

776
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:21,840
kitty drugs to give to your

777
00:30:19,558 --> 00:30:24,759
cat oregano you know people don't think

778
00:30:21,839 --> 00:30:27,319
about oregano um as as an ornamental too

779
00:30:24,759 --> 00:30:28,919
much but you know right now the oreganos

780
00:30:27,319 --> 00:30:30,558
uh down in Long Island are flowering we

781
00:30:28,919 --> 00:30:32,080
have all kinds of flowers They're whites

782
00:30:30,558 --> 00:30:34,440
and pinks and kind of these Purple

783
00:30:32,079 --> 00:30:36,798
colors uh you know people usually think

784
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:37,840
of oregano just as a culinary herb

785
00:30:36,798 --> 00:30:39,158
something that you're going to use when

786
00:30:37,839 --> 00:30:42,558
you're making pizzas or you're making

787
00:30:39,159 --> 00:30:44,360
sauce but um you know consider this as

788
00:30:42,558 --> 00:30:46,398
an ornamental in your garden because

789
00:30:44,359 --> 00:30:49,000
they they do have pretty flowers and

790
00:30:46,398 --> 00:30:52,199
they are actually used as cut flowers in

791
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,200
uh by some Farm

792
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:57,519
stands the packis Sanders are great very

793
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:59,199
dependable uh the the one that most

794
00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:01,200
people think of is the pisander

795
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:03,440
terminalis just the regular old

796
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:06,278
traditional pisander it's cheap and does

797
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:09,240
well in shade full shade it spreads by

798
00:31:06,278 --> 00:31:11,759
romes but don't forget its cousin the

799
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:15,919
natural species the uh pisander

800
00:31:11,759 --> 00:31:18,200
procumbent which is um also quite uh

801
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:21,320
resistant to Deer uh Dependable it

802
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:24,000
doesn't grow anywhere as quickly as uh

803
00:31:21,319 --> 00:31:25,839
terminalis but it will add a nice

804
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,359
addition it's somewhat decidous it's

805
00:31:25,839 --> 00:31:31,038
kind of semi decidous uh the foliage

806
00:31:28,359 --> 00:31:33,199
will turn this kind of bronze purple

807
00:31:31,038 --> 00:31:35,839
color uh in the fall and then also it

808
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:39,080
does flower in the spring not not

809
00:31:35,839 --> 00:31:39,079
spectacular flowers but

810
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:45,159
interesting okay okay yeah just kind of

811
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:46,440
yeah stop three minutes uh I haven't

812
00:31:45,159 --> 00:31:48,320
gotten to the Woodies yet but that's

813
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:53,000
okay we're all green husp we'd rather

814
00:31:48,319 --> 00:31:54,678
have probation yes um penies very good

815
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,480
very dependable deer stay away from them

816
00:31:54,679 --> 00:31:57,559
they don't even nibble on these and of

817
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:59,079
course you know in the the garden

818
00:31:57,558 --> 00:32:01,638
they're always fun to see com out of the

819
00:31:59,079 --> 00:32:03,918
ground in the spring those purple the P

820
00:32:01,638 --> 00:32:06,319
purple stems kind of very interesting

821
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:08,120
color addition to your garden of course

822
00:32:06,319 --> 00:32:10,678
you know the penies they do need steak

823
00:32:08,119 --> 00:32:13,959
to hold up the flowers but um but

824
00:32:10,679 --> 00:32:16,200
they're well worth the energy koves um I

825
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:18,240
don't know how Hardy propis are up

826
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:21,798
here there are okay they're Hardy up

827
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:23,399
here okay so um a lot of great gray uh

828
00:32:21,798 --> 00:32:26,240
color again in the foliage and then they

829
00:32:23,398 --> 00:32:28,278
get the pretty light blue flowers

830
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:29,919
another native plant the

831
00:32:28,278 --> 00:32:32,759
mayapple

832
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:34,840
um a beautiful plant you know it flowers

833
00:32:32,759 --> 00:32:37,200
then it gets the little um the fruit on

834
00:32:34,839 --> 00:32:38,879
it that some people make jam out of uh

835
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:40,880
and then about now down right now on

836
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:43,240
Long Island they're mostly dying back uh

837
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:47,720
they usually die before the end of

838
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:50,399
summer but um deer won't touch these

839
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:52,558
plants salv this is another culinary

840
00:32:50,398 --> 00:32:55,319
herb that we use a lot right the just

841
00:32:52,558 --> 00:32:57,119
the sage that we we use in stuffing and

842
00:32:55,319 --> 00:32:59,599
soups and all kinds of things people

843
00:32:57,119 --> 00:33:03,158
grow it as an herb but don't forget that

844
00:32:59,599 --> 00:33:05,240
it has a spectacular flower in about the

845
00:33:03,159 --> 00:33:07,559
same time that the catnips or cat mins

846
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:09,798
are flowering early summer they get this

847
00:33:07,558 --> 00:33:13,158
blue covered uh they're covered with

848
00:33:09,798 --> 00:33:15,119
blue flowers uh a really hearty plant

849
00:33:13,159 --> 00:33:16,519
Dependable this is another one that once

850
00:33:15,119 --> 00:33:18,319
it's done blooming I cut it all the way

851
00:33:16,519 --> 00:33:20,399
back to the ground and then you get this

852
00:33:18,319 --> 00:33:22,398
great you know this great gray green

853
00:33:20,398 --> 00:33:24,678
Foliage for the summer in that

854
00:33:22,398 --> 00:33:28,879
particular

855
00:33:24,679 --> 00:33:30,840
location Santa Lina's they're both um

856
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:33,480
deer won't eat these plants they're kind

857
00:33:30,839 --> 00:33:34,599
of fun plants they because these are

858
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:37,798
kinds of plants that if you're into

859
00:33:34,599 --> 00:33:39,678
shaping up little topiaries you know if

860
00:33:37,798 --> 00:33:43,200
you have like way too much free time on

861
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:46,440
your hands you can do that with these

862
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:48,200
plants Lamb's Ear are great uh again

863
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:51,200
another one with this whitish gray

864
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:53,639
foliage and people have often asked me

865
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:56,399
if they if we think that it's because of

866
00:33:53,638 --> 00:33:58,678
this white coloration that's what keep

867
00:33:56,398 --> 00:34:00,038
deer way I don't I don't really know but

868
00:33:58,679 --> 00:34:01,519
it does seem to be that there are a lot

869
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:03,440
of plants that have kind of a whitish

870
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:06,319
grap foliage that deer don't

871
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:08,398
eat uh fever Fu uh this is a plant

872
00:34:06,319 --> 00:34:10,519
that's everywhere in our Gardens in the

873
00:34:08,398 --> 00:34:12,519
shade garden in the sun Garden uh it

874
00:34:10,519 --> 00:34:14,039
recedes itself and it comes back

875
00:34:12,519 --> 00:34:16,759
dependably every year and the deer never

876
00:34:14,039 --> 00:34:19,800
touch it if you've ever smelled it you

877
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:21,440
probably know why they stay away from it

878
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:24,200
time don't forget you can never have

879
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:27,159
enough time and so this is true with the

880
00:34:24,199 --> 00:34:28,638
plant also um all the times again I

881
00:34:27,159 --> 00:34:30,039
haven't tried all the species of time

882
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:33,639
but I'd be willing to say that the deer

883
00:34:30,039 --> 00:34:35,719
don't touch these at all any of them per

884
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:40,480
perrywinkle with um it's pretty

885
00:34:35,719 --> 00:34:43,000
dependable and um Evergreen a good shade

886
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:46,240
plant okay let's go into Woodies I just

887
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:48,000
have a few Woodies bua um deer don't

888
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:49,319
touch this plant but I know what

889
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:52,918
somebody in this audience going to say

890
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:55,039
to me it's invasive right people this is

891
00:34:52,918 --> 00:34:58,159
get it's not on the invasive plant list

892
00:34:55,039 --> 00:35:00,440
but it's going to get there uh has come

893
00:34:58,159 --> 00:35:02,679
in white and purple and kind of a blue

894
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:05,440
colored so that's why nor up there is

895
00:35:02,679 --> 00:35:08,559
doing this breeding work with Vitex uh

896
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:11,200
the Vitex is a good uh replacement for

897
00:35:08,559 --> 00:35:13,559
the bua it looks almost exactly like it

898
00:35:11,199 --> 00:35:17,000
except it has these marijuana like

899
00:35:13,559 --> 00:35:18,320
leaves that um that are not like bul

900
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,239
they don't have the same effect you know

901
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:22,039
we try to smoke them but it just doesn't

902
00:35:20,239 --> 00:35:24,239
do the same

903
00:35:22,039 --> 00:35:26,920
thing but nor you know what if we can

904
00:35:24,239 --> 00:35:29,000
get that kind of marijuana kind of

905
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:31,480
activity that might not be so bad but

906
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:33,838
anyway so uh Vitex it's not supposed to

907
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:35,800
be Hardy up here in in Ithaca but we

908
00:35:33,838 --> 00:35:37,239
noticed that at Cornell plantations last

909
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:38,680
year they planted several plants and

910
00:35:37,239 --> 00:35:40,679
they all lived the winter of course it

911
00:35:38,679 --> 00:35:42,598
was a mild winter but we'll see what

912
00:35:40,679 --> 00:35:46,598
happens but this is typically a plant

913
00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:49,280
for more warmer Zone 7 Long Island Zone

914
00:35:46,599 --> 00:35:51,400
7 boxwoods we mentioned boxwoods Paul

915
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:52,960
mentioned boxwood earlier too uh deer

916
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:55,920
won't eat it but yes there is that

917
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:58,240
disease problem uh but margerie there

918
00:35:55,920 --> 00:36:00,200
are certain cultivar that are resistant

919
00:35:58,239 --> 00:36:02,318
right to the the boxwood B is that what

920
00:36:00,199 --> 00:36:07,679
you're

921
00:36:02,318 --> 00:36:07,679
okay oh the same disease oh

922
00:36:07,838 --> 00:36:13,119
yikes yeah oh that's too bad but

923
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:15,160
boxwoods deer won't touch the boxwood um

924
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:16,920
a lot of different CS but we we have

925
00:36:15,159 --> 00:36:19,199
several in our own personal garden and

926
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:20,480
some of them just they are wonderful

927
00:36:19,199 --> 00:36:22,919
looking they don't get affected by any

928
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:26,719
kind of disease the junipers a lot of

929
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:28,599
the junipers are um resistant to Deer

930
00:36:26,719 --> 00:36:30,000
but I won't say every Juniper is so look

931
00:36:28,599 --> 00:36:30,680
on the list I have the list of the ones

932
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,159
that

933
00:36:30,679 --> 00:36:35,879
are and one of my favorite native plants

934
00:36:33,159 --> 00:36:37,920
of course is the bay Berry um this is a

935
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:40,720
plant it's it's kind of a deciduous

936
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:42,318
plant um that we grow a lot in Long

937
00:36:40,719 --> 00:36:44,838
Island because it's very drop tolerant

938
00:36:42,318 --> 00:36:48,639
it also tolerates salt water uh don't

939
00:36:44,838 --> 00:36:51,559
forget that the bay Berry is uh dious so

940
00:36:48,639 --> 00:36:53,598
you have female plants and male plants

941
00:36:51,559 --> 00:36:55,679
and uh if you want these pretty berries

942
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:58,760
you're going to have to get the

943
00:36:55,679 --> 00:37:00,480
females and then the tree peie also

944
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:03,160
there's a difference between the te tree

945
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:07,240
peie and the herbaceous peie um this one

946
00:37:03,159 --> 00:37:09,279
is a Woody and um you don't want to cut

947
00:37:07,239 --> 00:37:10,358
this one down in the fall if you cut

948
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:11,319
this one down in the fall you're cutting

949
00:37:10,358 --> 00:37:13,159
the stem off and you're cutting the

950
00:37:11,318 --> 00:37:14,559
flowers off for next year so so the tree

951
00:37:13,159 --> 00:37:16,000
peeny don't prune that back to the

952
00:37:14,559 --> 00:37:19,239
ground

953
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:22,199
please and I think so we should cut it

954
00:37:19,239 --> 00:37:24,598
short you think okay so I do before we

955
00:37:22,199 --> 00:37:27,639
um get to the very end I do want to

956
00:37:24,599 --> 00:37:30,760
mention that we are organizing this um

957
00:37:27,639 --> 00:37:33,159
Eco tour in May if anybody's interested

958
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:35,920
to see me about it it's 11 days in the

959
00:37:33,159 --> 00:37:37,759
Galapagos uh I've done this before and

960
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:41,079
it's the most wonderful experience of

961
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:43,359
your life and uh it's not it's not a

962
00:37:41,079 --> 00:37:45,680
vacation uh every day we have in the

963
00:37:43,358 --> 00:37:47,440
morning we get up at 6 we leave at 6:00

964
00:37:45,679 --> 00:37:50,078
and we hike for 3 hours on a different

965
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:52,720
Island and um then we snorkel for about

966
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:54,920
3 hours and then in the end of the day

967
00:37:52,719 --> 00:37:56,759
we hike again so it it's not for the

968
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:58,760
faint of heart but if you're interested

969
00:37:56,760 --> 00:38:00,400
in something that would be one of the

970
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:03,920
most exciting experiences of your life

971
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:05,559

972
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:07,480
really have much time but I will be out

973
00:38:05,559 --> 00:38:10,279
