1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:06,060
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:08,189
University thank you so much Don for

3
00:00:06,059 --> 00:00:10,169
such a kind introduction and thank you

4
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:13,019
so much everyone for coming here today I

5
00:00:10,169 --> 00:00:15,000
know it's such a high demanding labor in

6
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:17,160
the field right now and but thanks to

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:23,009
the rayon that you can get the other

8
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:25,500
people to you so the main the main goal

9
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:27,449
of my research is only one thing it was

10
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:29,820
trying to breed switchgrass to be

11
00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:32,579
resistant to diseases caused by by Paris

12
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:35,009
or I see so the topic here that I put is

13
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:38,329
pretty simple that does the switch grass

14
00:00:35,009 --> 00:00:41,429
versus the by Perez or I see which is a

15
00:00:38,329 --> 00:00:45,590
fungal pathogen a challenge in breeding

16
00:00:41,429 --> 00:00:47,820
for resistant I know that I have been

17
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:50,010
presenting you about switchgrass

18
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:51,960
for so many years and so many times now

19
00:00:50,009 --> 00:00:54,479
but you may think that switch pad is

20
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:56,609
still out of your out of your circle

21
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:59,488
it's just out of your everyday life but

22
00:00:56,609 --> 00:01:01,769
actually it's not because the first

23
00:00:59,488 --> 00:01:04,319
picture this is a switchgrass that I was

24
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:06,780
taking the tick was taking this picture

25
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:09,209
right in front of corneal health center

26
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:11,640
or can it and he was planted in the

27
00:01:09,209 --> 00:01:14,219
slope like right in front of that so

28
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:16,228
sushma has been used for preventing the

29
00:01:14,219 --> 00:01:19,408
soil erosion pretty well in this case

30
00:01:16,228 --> 00:01:22,500
and also the second pictures can you

31
00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:24,810
guess where is this one it's in Stuart

32
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:28,709
Park one of your favorite place in

33
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:31,590
Ithaca actually we have yeah so it was

34
00:01:28,709 --> 00:01:34,709
planted in just the side of the road so

35
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:37,079
switchback has been used for the for the

36
00:01:34,709 --> 00:01:39,298
landscape decoration quite some time but

37
00:01:37,078 --> 00:01:45,000
actually Swiss grass has been introduced

38
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:47,549
as a forest purpose crop but in 2000

39
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:51,060
square has been introduced as one of the

40
00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:53,670
biomass candidate by Department of

41
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:56,040
Energy as a biomass crop because of its

42
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:59,790
high you and it's also good in terms of

43
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:03,719
greenhouse gas image and capacity right

44
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:05,729
here it's also very well it's a native

45
00:02:03,718 --> 00:02:08,219
grass to North America and it's very

46
00:02:05,728 --> 00:02:11,550
well adapted across the latitude so it's

47
00:02:08,219 --> 00:02:13,960
separated into a plan switchgrass and

48
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:16,120
lowland switchgrass so

49
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:17,680
this the next victor is a comparison

50
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:21,039
between the upland and lowlands to

51
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:23,050
express so this sir on your left-hand

52
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:26,439
side is a upland and on your right-hand

53
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:30,280
side it's a lowland so normally a plan

54
00:02:26,439 --> 00:02:32,379
is well adapted to the cold wind like ko

55
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:35,409
winter out like right down around here

56
00:02:32,379 --> 00:02:39,159
but the lowland is well adapted into

57
00:02:35,409 --> 00:02:42,250
like the higher moisture area and also

58
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:45,909
provided more you another different is

59
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:48,340
the deploy be level a different a that

60
00:02:45,909 --> 00:02:49,359
upland is normally octopi and lowland is

61
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:54,310
normally thattaboy

62
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:56,230
but if you just one like the just just a

63
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:58,210
general idea if you walked in the field

64
00:02:56,229 --> 00:03:00,639
so you can separate it by just the

65
00:02:58,210 --> 00:03:04,719
colors of it because the lowland type is

66
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:06,279
normally bluish green and based on these

67
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:09,120
difference it's also a difference in

68
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:14,250
terms of the resistance also

69
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:17,800
surprisingly after domestication in 1940

70
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:20,530
nineteen seven seventy there there are

71
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:23,230
only about 1700 application of

72
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:26,979
switchgrass and litter of them just only

73
00:03:23,229 --> 00:03:28,479
28 of them is related to disease even

74
00:03:26,979 --> 00:03:30,579
though and John mentioned that there's a

75
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:33,340
lots of diseases in switchgrass such as

76
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:37,200
rust and track nose and of course the

77
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:40,030
the deceased bye-bye for its Ric and

78
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:42,969
let's get back to our basic and

79
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:45,879
pathology triangle that to confer the

80
00:03:42,969 --> 00:03:47,710
resistant of acceptability the horse

81
00:03:45,879 --> 00:03:50,829
which is switched grass that I already

82
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:53,590
introduced to you was attacked by a

83
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:56,350
pathogen and in this case is by priests

84
00:03:53,590 --> 00:04:00,129
or I see vibrates or I see is an ESCO

85
00:03:56,349 --> 00:04:04,719
mices fungus that it's it's a necrotic

86
00:04:00,129 --> 00:04:07,479
nickel copic pathogen and to present in

87
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:09,639
general if we want to emphasize the

88
00:04:07,479 --> 00:04:11,500
importance of the disease we always put

89
00:04:09,639 --> 00:04:13,869
the worst case scenario and of course

90
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:17,048
which pass I'm sorry of a course by

91
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:19,989
forests of or I see also has the worst

92
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:22,750
case of bees disease that it killed 2 to

93
00:04:19,988 --> 00:04:27,299
3 million people in India during the

94
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:27,300
Bengal famine in 1943

95
00:04:27,339 --> 00:04:32,769
and these because this can cause the

96
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:35,620
disease in rice and this pathogen also

97
00:04:32,769 --> 00:04:37,329
cost the city in switchgrass also it can

98
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:40,720
cause two diseases

99
00:04:37,329 --> 00:04:42,909
first is by three C drugs as the name

100
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,919
suggested it reduce the termination of

101
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:47,229
the seeds but even though that seeds can

102
00:04:44,918 --> 00:04:50,198
germinate this pathogen can infect the

103
00:04:47,228 --> 00:04:52,569
shoot and the root of that of the seeds

104
00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:55,240
also and it can these are the pictures

105
00:04:52,569 --> 00:04:57,639
of the of the hyphy and the corn idea

106
00:04:55,240 --> 00:05:00,610
which is a sexual sport of this pathogen

107
00:04:57,639 --> 00:05:04,629
on the seat surface another disease is

108
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:06,729
by prairie leaf spot that it cost the

109
00:05:04,629 --> 00:05:09,100
necrotic lesions on the leaves like this

110
00:05:06,728 --> 00:05:11,379
that can reduce the you up to fifty

111
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:14,050
percent and that's a huge amount if we

112
00:05:11,379 --> 00:05:17,709
consider to you used to use switchgrass

113
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:20,228
for biomass production in terms of

114
00:05:17,709 --> 00:05:22,239
management of the disease we need to

115
00:05:20,228 --> 00:05:24,399
understand the lifecycle of the pathogen

116
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:26,490
before we make any decision which way

117
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:30,849
we're gonna manage the disease and

118
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:34,418
vibrates or I see it's the seed and so I

119
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:37,539
borne pathogen that the first inoculum

120
00:05:34,418 --> 00:05:39,579
of the disease is from the seeds that it

121
00:05:37,538 --> 00:05:42,399
was introduced to the few and after that

122
00:05:39,579 --> 00:05:44,819
the high field of these pathogen can

123
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:48,609
grow into the soil and leaf and

124
00:05:44,819 --> 00:05:50,740
overwintering within the within the crop

125
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:54,610
residue in the field and after that this

126
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:57,639
it can spray except spread the the

127
00:05:54,610 --> 00:06:02,348
quantity of Spore into the mature plant

128
00:05:57,639 --> 00:06:04,360
and cause the leaf the leaf lesion the

129
00:06:02,348 --> 00:06:06,668
last angle of this triangle is

130
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:09,550
environment what is the best environment

131
00:06:06,668 --> 00:06:11,500
for for this pathogen to cause the

132
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:14,889
disease in switchgrass and of course

133
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:16,839
it's here in New York with the with the

134
00:06:14,889 --> 00:06:19,210
prolong high humidity and high

135
00:06:16,839 --> 00:06:22,329
temperature during summer this is the

136
00:06:19,209 --> 00:06:26,978
perfect home for these disease that's

137
00:06:22,329 --> 00:06:29,500
why I like that's why I'm what I I work

138
00:06:26,978 --> 00:06:31,769
with this disease and why I picked the

139
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:34,839
breeding

140
00:06:31,769 --> 00:06:37,779
management method over other approaches

141
00:06:34,839 --> 00:06:41,560
that okay if it's a fungal disease why

142
00:06:37,779 --> 00:06:44,049
don't we just spray spray at the front

143
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:46,420
aside to the few or fumaça the soy as it

144
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:49,840
the soy borne pathogen of course you can

145
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:53,560
do that but it's pricey right because we

146
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:55,629
consider we we consider consider using

147
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:58,420
switchgrass for biomass production and

148
00:06:55,629 --> 00:06:59,800
we try to reduce the input as much as I

149
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:02,680
can as we can

150
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:04,780
another solution is because it is seed

151
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:08,490
borne pathogen why don't we just

152
00:07:04,779 --> 00:07:11,559
just soak the seed with the fungus I

153
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:14,110
even though I show you that there's a

154
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:16,300
fungal this fungus can grow on the seat

155
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:19,120
surface but these also has been proof

156
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:21,280
that it's in there can be with inside

157
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:24,100
the seed tissue so this may not be an

158
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:26,319
option another one is just the

159
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:29,770
cultivation practice normally like we

160
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:31,569
can like plow the soy to disrupt the to

161
00:07:29,769 --> 00:07:33,519
disrupt the life cycle of these disease

162
00:07:31,569 --> 00:07:36,219
but because switchgrass is a perennial

163
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:39,729
crop so this this is not an option

164
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:41,830
another another another concern about

165
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:44,020
these switchgrass is the target

166
00:07:41,829 --> 00:07:47,319
environment for switchgrass it's in

167
00:07:44,019 --> 00:07:51,370
martin öhlin such as to reclaim my area

168
00:07:47,319 --> 00:07:55,959
that we try to reduce the competition

169
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:58,720
between food and and oil and crops who

170
00:07:55,959 --> 00:08:01,000
grow in life in a good land so this is

171
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:04,240
the target environment here that it has

172
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:06,220
low nutrient high i heavy metal and high

173
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:08,350
acidity that's the worst place to live

174
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:11,230
to plant switchgrass but that's a place

175
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:15,460
that that we picked for finding them so

176
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:19,230
and that's that's why i pick the method

177
00:08:15,459 --> 00:08:21,849
of breeding to manage these disease so

178
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:23,950
the content today i already introduced

179
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:26,110
you the background of the hosts which

180
00:08:23,949 --> 00:08:30,430
pass the pathogen of the vibrates or IC

181
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:33,460
and to make a selection I set up the

182
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:37,360
screening method first let's move into

183
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:40,089
the first one so four by four feet broad

184
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:42,370
I basically just soak the seat with the

185
00:08:40,089 --> 00:08:44,200
inoculum and come with the inoculum and

186
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:45,519
compare with the seat with just a

187
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:49,570
control one

188
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:51,519
so I set up the screening method based

189
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:56,350
on this height based on these the

190
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:59,019
variation and I found that Adweek these

191
00:08:56,350 --> 00:09:01,360
are the like and I found that the the

192
00:08:59,019 --> 00:09:04,958
first week shows the highest germination

193
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:06,850
but that is not the that is not the day

194
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:09,549
that I should collect the data because

195
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:12,129
do you remember that these pathogen can

196
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:15,039
infect the shoot and the root of the of

197
00:09:12,129 --> 00:09:18,100
the new leader early germinated seeds so

198
00:09:15,039 --> 00:09:20,588
that's can drop the germination during

199
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:24,430
the week three here so I picked a week

200
00:09:20,589 --> 00:09:27,730
for two evil evil at least these disease

201
00:09:24,429 --> 00:09:30,278
and to scratch its screen this the

202
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:33,070
resistant with this condition another

203
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:35,830
disease is the Buried leaf spot so I

204
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:38,350
have to option here like to screen in

205
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:41,320
seedlings or to screen in mature plants

206
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:43,509
I picked the seedlings one because I can

207
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:45,459
handle it in greenhouse like any time of

208
00:09:43,509 --> 00:09:47,799
the year and I also can increase the

209
00:09:45,458 --> 00:09:51,819
number or num increase the replicates as

210
00:09:47,799 --> 00:09:54,609
many as I want so I used at least a

211
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:57,010
thousand or two thousand per cycle for

212
00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:59,440
screening that it would take like a lot

213
00:09:57,009 --> 00:10:02,950
of land to produce in the in the field

214
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:06,070
for mature plants so the basic method

215
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:08,890
for screening this is to I screen the

216
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:11,079
resistant to vibrate leaf spot in four

217
00:10:08,889 --> 00:10:13,600
weeks all settings I sprayed it cover

218
00:10:11,078 --> 00:10:19,449
with a clear plastic bag for 24 hours

219
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:21,190
delays it and and I set up and I did you

220
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:23,200
mean the condition when I'm gonna

221
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:26,800
evaluate the disease and what

222
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:29,110
concentration I use so these are the

223
00:10:26,799 --> 00:10:33,429
score that I've that I used to evaluate

224
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:38,470
the disease resistant from 0% to 100% as

225
00:10:33,429 --> 00:10:41,739
like 100 the coper the whole leaf so I

226
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:45,579
have two options to just just evaluate

227
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:48,759
at only one day or add as a percent leaf

228
00:10:45,578 --> 00:10:50,620
coverage by their lesions or I can use

229
00:10:48,759 --> 00:10:54,458
the area under this is progress curb

230
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:55,480
along with from day one to day ten and I

231
00:10:54,458 --> 00:10:59,049
found that there's a very high

232
00:10:55,480 --> 00:11:01,539
correlation between the the air

233
00:10:59,049 --> 00:11:05,469
the one day at this event to that 10

234
00:11:01,539 --> 00:11:07,539
days Valu at Rao point 9 so I so the

235
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:13,120
screening method will be just evaluate

236
00:11:07,539 --> 00:11:15,849
at fights at the day 7 only and so I

237
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:18,100
used this criteria and I used the

238
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:20,470
highest concentration to screen this to

239
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:22,329
increase the intensity that you have to

240
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:27,129
survive from this and you'll be the best

241
00:11:22,328 --> 00:11:29,559
and do and at this point I I was

242
00:11:27,129 --> 00:11:32,708
wondering like if the seat that was

243
00:11:29,559 --> 00:11:35,619
inoculated before that can survive from

244
00:11:32,708 --> 00:11:38,588
those pathogen can also increase the it

245
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:42,759
resistant when they grow up as resist as

246
00:11:38,589 --> 00:11:45,459
the seedlings so but I couldn't but

247
00:11:42,759 --> 00:11:47,259
based on that experiment I found that

248
00:11:45,458 --> 00:11:50,559
there's no correlation between the

249
00:11:47,259 --> 00:11:55,569
resistant of these two to DC these two

250
00:11:50,559 --> 00:12:00,969
disease so based on this no correlation

251
00:11:55,570 --> 00:12:03,010
I use this no correlation to setup I use

252
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:06,278
this information to set up the breeding

253
00:12:03,009 --> 00:12:10,028
scheme and let's move into the third one

254
00:12:06,278 --> 00:12:15,820
that I make the actual selection based

255
00:12:10,028 --> 00:12:18,039
on these resistance so basically I use a

256
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:20,320
recurrent phenotypic selection for two

257
00:12:18,039 --> 00:12:22,958
cycles of selection and based on the

258
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:26,399
fact that beast too resistant has no

259
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:29,799
correlation I separated into into

260
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:31,659
resistant by vibrated secret and vibrate

261
00:12:29,799 --> 00:12:34,708
leaf spot I made for a two cycle top

262
00:12:31,659 --> 00:12:37,600
selection and at the end of cycle to I

263
00:12:34,708 --> 00:12:40,059
taste a reciprocal taste between that

264
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:43,389
the one that selected for vibration rods

265
00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:45,969
also got like Osprey by the pipe

266
00:12:43,389 --> 00:12:50,319
got spray when it was in seedlings also

267
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:52,720
and because shelter and Kevin Rock show

268
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:55,480
pretty well adapted to New York and hide

269
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:57,730
you in New York State I pick I make a

270
00:12:55,480 --> 00:13:02,570
selection based on these two population

271
00:12:57,730 --> 00:13:07,370
which is a plan switchgrass I produce

272
00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:08,930
just hop ship seats in greenhouse and in

273
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:12,200
few nursery

274
00:13:08,929 --> 00:13:14,239
I also producer so I made a selection

275
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:15,950
for the caiman drop and shelter right

276
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:18,139
which is an upland type so I can produce

277
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:20,930
it interview easily but I also produce

278
00:13:18,139 --> 00:13:21,679
to have success of the callow in in the

279
00:13:20,929 --> 00:13:24,679
greenhouse

280
00:13:21,679 --> 00:13:27,829
also because hello is a so I used hello

281
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:30,439
as a lowland representative in this case

282
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:35,110
to to have an idea like what is the

283
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:35,110
resistant in their lowland should be and

284
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:40,970
normally when we make a selection it's

285
00:13:38,059 --> 00:13:45,099
it's good to know like good to know how

286
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:47,360
horrible it the trade is that's why I I

287
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:49,389
evaluate her to be based on the

288
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:51,919
individual and based on the hops it and

289
00:13:49,389 --> 00:13:54,620
the results showing that the for the

290
00:13:51,919 --> 00:13:58,399
resistant to buy for a seed brought the

291
00:13:54,620 --> 00:14:00,620
kelo kelo switch past showing like

292
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:03,829
pretty pretty high with moderate to high

293
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:05,690
fertility at point five and the one that

294
00:14:03,830 --> 00:14:08,420
I made an actual selection which is a

295
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:11,240
cabin drop it's showing at point three

296
00:14:08,419 --> 00:14:14,569
which is also moderate heritability that

297
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:16,399
when you get this number before you make

298
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:17,870
the selection we have you had hope that

299
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:20,629
you can get some gain from this

300
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:23,539
selection and of course I make some gain

301
00:14:20,629 --> 00:14:26,419
from this election this graph represent

302
00:14:23,539 --> 00:14:29,539
this the y-axis represent the percent

303
00:14:26,419 --> 00:14:31,939
germination and each pair of the of the

304
00:14:29,539 --> 00:14:35,299
Bhakra represent each cycle of selection

305
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:37,550
on your left hand side is the wrist

306
00:14:35,299 --> 00:14:39,889
respond from the cap in rock and your

307
00:14:37,549 --> 00:14:42,589
right hand side is a shelter let's see

308
00:14:39,889 --> 00:14:44,600
at at the Kim Rockford Kevin rock first

309
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:46,550
that you remember that I got moderate

310
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:51,680
heritability so I should have some

311
00:14:46,549 --> 00:14:55,129
progress here the the the yellow bar is

312
00:14:51,679 --> 00:14:57,649
the control because control seed and the

313
00:14:55,129 --> 00:14:59,840
blue bar is the inoculated seeds as you

314
00:14:57,649 --> 00:15:01,909
can see here for the base cycle the

315
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:04,519
cycle zero that never be selected before

316
00:15:01,909 --> 00:15:08,629
they say this is significantly different

317
00:15:04,519 --> 00:15:11,090
between control and the inoculated one

318
00:15:08,629 --> 00:15:14,730
that the inoculated one has a reduction

319
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:16,680
in the germination and the

320
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:20,389
the difference between the control and

321
00:15:16,679 --> 00:15:24,259
inoculated ones do persist in psycho

322
00:15:20,389 --> 00:15:26,460
psycho one also but these differences

323
00:15:24,259 --> 00:15:29,519
between the control and the treatment

324
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:33,060
one was reducing into non significantly

325
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:36,240
different in within psycho psycho psycho

326
00:15:33,059 --> 00:15:38,759
two which is good that okay you get the

327
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:41,370
good result out of this this similar

328
00:15:38,759 --> 00:15:45,149
trend is also happening with the shelter

329
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:47,220
that the the best populations do have

330
00:15:45,149 --> 00:15:50,789
was significantly different between the

331
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:52,680
control and the treatment one but we

332
00:15:50,789 --> 00:15:55,009
leave just one cycle of selection that

333
00:15:52,679 --> 00:15:58,139
gap was significantly different at all

334
00:15:55,009 --> 00:16:00,750
here and based on this gap between the

335
00:15:58,139 --> 00:16:03,870
control and inoculated one I plot this

336
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:06,659
this gap as a percent termination

337
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:09,060
reduction the lower the bar the more

338
00:16:06,659 --> 00:16:12,269
resistant disease as you see here the

339
00:16:09,059 --> 00:16:14,759
trend is very obvious that from psycho

340
00:16:12,269 --> 00:16:16,919
zero so castle cycle two in Kevin Rock

341
00:16:14,759 --> 00:16:19,860
its drop like this which means that it's

342
00:16:16,919 --> 00:16:22,259
increased the resistant obviously the

343
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:24,240
similar trend also happen in shelter two

344
00:16:22,259 --> 00:16:26,159
that is dropped but it has a variation

345
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:28,549
here but it's already like difference

346
00:16:26,159 --> 00:16:31,500
and the base population in this case

347
00:16:28,549 --> 00:16:34,919
based on this huge improvement on

348
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:37,139
percent germination reduction the

349
00:16:34,919 --> 00:16:39,929
percent genetic gains rate between cycle

350
00:16:37,139 --> 00:16:43,049
zero and cycle to cycle zero and say go

351
00:16:39,929 --> 00:16:45,539
to here it's over a hundred percent but

352
00:16:43,049 --> 00:16:48,120
it's around sixty percent per cycle of

353
00:16:45,539 --> 00:16:49,829
selection and it's also around fifty

354
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:53,190
percent per cycle of selection in

355
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:54,840
shelter also and based on these percent

356
00:16:53,190 --> 00:16:56,940
genetic gains I can calculate the

357
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:59,610
liability heritability which is to

358
00:16:56,940 --> 00:17:02,580
realize its ability in case in this case

359
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:06,059
of the German of the binary trade like

360
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:09,269
this that it's got y2 here and point

361
00:17:06,059 --> 00:17:12,119
three here which is acceptable what the

362
00:17:09,269 --> 00:17:14,910
rate heritability so as a plant breeder

363
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:16,979
I'm so proud of this result that okay I

364
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:18,660
got something out of this but what about

365
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:21,720
do you remember another disease they

366
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:24,180
vibrate leaf spot that is like so I got

367
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:26,130
this resolved so I hope I get something

368
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:28,620
from that so I went to the to the

369
00:17:26,130 --> 00:17:30,540
similar step to first evaluate the hurt

370
00:17:28,619 --> 00:17:34,289
beauty of that resistant to vibrate leaf

371
00:17:30,539 --> 00:17:37,349
spot and it this is the result

372
00:17:34,289 --> 00:17:40,649
this is like am I dreaming

373
00:17:37,349 --> 00:17:42,750
is it zero zero not hurt a bit are you

374
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:47,400
serious like I spent like three years on

375
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:53,670
this and it's zero so I didn't keep up

376
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:56,100
that time so at that time the first

377
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:58,440
evaluation of the estimate of the her to

378
00:17:56,099 --> 00:18:01,469
be its to me it was being was done in

379
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:04,470
seven trays with with three replicates

380
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:07,380
so I try to like change the inoculation

381
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:09,710
method from just the health way to the

382
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:12,840
airbrush that can produce more

383
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:15,179
consistence more drop of the inoculum

384
00:18:12,839 --> 00:18:18,209
that can firmly attached to the leaf

385
00:18:15,179 --> 00:18:23,519
well I tried everything I try to and I

386
00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:25,769
also try to fit just from 125 hops a

387
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:28,950
protein ease across seven trace I fit it

388
00:18:25,769 --> 00:18:31,679
into just one tray and just discard like

389
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:35,250
most of them just use 44 hop zip of that

390
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:37,380
and I try like a lots of combination up

391
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:42,359
here and it's been almost a year on this

392
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:44,670
and Wow all of them 0 or non significant

393
00:18:42,359 --> 00:18:46,699
let's just grade that is very good news

394
00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:50,940
for you

395
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:53,460
so after and this is like but I didn't

396
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:56,160
trust the result from these fertility

397
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:58,019
estimate because come on that's just the

398
00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:00,900
estimate and what's up what about if I

399
00:18:58,019 --> 00:19:02,700
just just stoppin to make the risk to

400
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:04,559
make selection based on these techniques

401
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:09,029
and this is the result of my

402
00:19:04,558 --> 00:19:10,980
stubbornness but but none of them like

403
00:19:09,029 --> 00:19:14,639
each thing none of them looks the same

404
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:17,250
are they copying the result ish none of

405
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:20,520
them making any see any progress out of

406
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:24,779
this election so what's wrong with that

407
00:19:20,519 --> 00:19:27,690
I still don't know so I try to make the

408
00:19:24,779 --> 00:19:31,019
case cross like to go back to this the

409
00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:33,210
newer basic genetics class to go back to

410
00:19:31,019 --> 00:19:35,250
your first step to make a test cross I

411
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:37,590
make a cross of the resistant by

412
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:40,740
resistant resistant by susceptible

413
00:19:37,589 --> 00:19:42,379
acceptable by resistant and resistant by

414
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:45,349
resistance as

415
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:49,070
as the bid from the basic tech book

416
00:19:45,349 --> 00:19:51,409
textbook and I found that all of them

417
00:19:49,069 --> 00:19:53,419
like these are the histogram of the

418
00:19:51,410 --> 00:19:55,790
progeny of each cross the resistant

419
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:58,730
resistant resistance acceptable and each

420
00:19:55,789 --> 00:20:02,240
cross of yet the the top here is a cape

421
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:05,900
in rock protein II and out of and the

422
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:08,779
lower here is a shelter progenies and

423
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:12,200
all of this graph rep

424
00:20:08,779 --> 00:20:14,859
nomally distributed with just unimodal

425
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:18,740
pattern like there's no multiple like

426
00:20:14,859 --> 00:20:22,129
the kids in this segregation in this

427
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:24,620
histogram so i can conclude that these

428
00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:26,630
resistant might be this resistance

429
00:20:24,619 --> 00:20:29,869
should be controlled by multiple alleles

430
00:20:26,630 --> 00:20:33,610
with the small effects of each alleles

431
00:20:29,869 --> 00:20:35,959
and because i there's no significant

432
00:20:33,609 --> 00:20:39,379
difference between the reciprocal cross

433
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:43,269
i can conclude that there's no ii linked

434
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:47,480
in here it's an inheritance here and

435
00:20:43,269 --> 00:20:49,990
also this only like even like when i try

436
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:53,000
to compare between this group across

437
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:55,400
only the resistant by resistant is

438
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:58,359
differently different from the

439
00:20:55,400 --> 00:21:01,790
succeptible base acceptable which is not

440
00:20:58,359 --> 00:21:04,099
which is this this this different is

441
00:21:01,789 --> 00:21:07,190
expected but I have also expected that

442
00:21:04,099 --> 00:21:09,109
the the one that got the resistant in

443
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:11,720
the cross leg resistant by susceptible

444
00:21:09,109 --> 00:21:13,699
and resistant bus susceptible resistance

445
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:16,009
should be different from the subsets

446
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:20,000
above acceptable also but it didn't show

447
00:21:16,009 --> 00:21:23,569
that way so in the conclusion for from

448
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:27,740
these selection based on the different

449
00:21:23,569 --> 00:21:30,500
trend in the in the selection that the

450
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:33,319
top bar is a selection it's a screening

451
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:36,319
for the vibrate seat rock and the lower

452
00:21:33,319 --> 00:21:39,289
bar lower result is a resistant to by

453
00:21:36,319 --> 00:21:41,210
free this leaf spot and you see like

454
00:21:39,289 --> 00:21:45,139
there's no trend here like flat trend

455
00:21:41,210 --> 00:21:47,509
here and in the resistant to vibrate sit

456
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:50,780
right that's a huge trend here they it

457
00:21:47,509 --> 00:21:52,609
reduce here the the light blue bar here

458
00:21:50,779 --> 00:21:55,740
representing the population that was

459
00:21:52,609 --> 00:21:57,839
selected for vibrate leaf spot so

460
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:59,849
there's a reduction here there's no

461
00:21:57,839 --> 00:22:03,689
significantly different between the

462
00:21:59,849 --> 00:22:06,928
between beast with with the base

463
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:09,660
population so I make up at this point I

464
00:22:06,929 --> 00:22:12,269
made significant progress in the

465
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:14,130
resistant to back rate citron but I

466
00:22:12,269 --> 00:22:16,859
didn't make any progress in the

467
00:22:14,130 --> 00:22:18,990
batteries leaf spot but that's that's

468
00:22:16,859 --> 00:22:21,629
not the that's not all the bad news

469
00:22:18,990 --> 00:22:23,519
because do you remember the back the the

470
00:22:21,630 --> 00:22:27,360
previously that I mentioned that bcc's

471
00:22:23,519 --> 00:22:28,319
was primary was inoculated firstly in

472
00:22:27,359 --> 00:22:31,409
the seeds

473
00:22:28,319 --> 00:22:33,509
that's the seeds carry the pathogen into

474
00:22:31,410 --> 00:22:36,630
the field at the first so this at least

475
00:22:33,509 --> 00:22:38,700
good news that I can reduce the primary

476
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:41,160
inoculation to the few at the beginning

477
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:43,350
that its overall gonna reduce the

478
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:46,759
incidence of vibrate leaf spot in the

479
00:22:43,349 --> 00:22:53,099
field in the later year and what's odd

480
00:22:46,759 --> 00:22:55,679
the explanation of the of the of the no

481
00:22:53,099 --> 00:22:57,678
progress in resistant to bacterial leaf

482
00:22:55,679 --> 00:23:00,630
spot there's a there's a bunch of them

483
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:03,540
there may be the low natural pressure of

484
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:05,850
these or this is a complex trait that

485
00:23:03,539 --> 00:23:09,210
it's control like basis and I work with

486
00:23:05,849 --> 00:23:11,339
the octopi switchgrass and to psych hold

487
00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:14,789
up selection may not be enough to push

488
00:23:11,339 --> 00:23:16,919
these to be more resistant or the worst

489
00:23:14,789 --> 00:23:20,210
case is there might not be the resistant

490
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:23,850
in this population that I'm working with

491
00:23:20,210 --> 00:23:26,220
so here is a conclusion for the

492
00:23:23,849 --> 00:23:27,539
prettiest part of my research and be

493
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:29,789
still confirm that there's no

494
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:32,339
correlation between these two resistant

495
00:23:29,789 --> 00:23:34,470
and this can give the idea that in

496
00:23:32,339 --> 00:23:37,849
future we can make a selection based on

497
00:23:34,470 --> 00:23:41,940
these two traits like if like separately

498
00:23:37,849 --> 00:23:43,919
so but I at this point of of my result I

499
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:47,759
was at my fourth year already

500
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:49,830
so so if you add my shoes in my shoes so

501
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:54,960
you know how it's you but I didn't feel

502
00:23:49,829 --> 00:23:57,359
discouraged actually but but but I try

503
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:59,069
to like I try to learn what's what's

504
00:23:57,359 --> 00:24:01,678
wrong with a resistant to by three leaf

505
00:23:59,069 --> 00:24:05,339
spot and because even though these

506
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:07,530
disease these beliefs what it's it's one

507
00:24:05,339 --> 00:24:09,839
of the major disease in rice but there

508
00:24:07,529 --> 00:24:12,240
are only four publications about

509
00:24:09,839 --> 00:24:15,808
the resistance in the rice population

510
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:17,460
which is quite I don't know what what

511
00:24:15,808 --> 00:24:19,528
was wrong with this but there's only

512
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:21,960
four papers of that but the reason the

513
00:24:19,528 --> 00:24:24,089
most recent paper was identified was

514
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:27,509
trying to identify the resistant in

515
00:24:24,089 --> 00:24:30,898
three chromosome and they used the they

516
00:24:27,509 --> 00:24:32,970
used snips they can confirm the 13 snips

517
00:24:30,898 --> 00:24:35,428
marker that linked to the resistant

518
00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:38,759
region here but they're just in that

519
00:24:35,429 --> 00:24:41,850
paper data stop there so I try to dig a

520
00:24:38,759 --> 00:24:43,889
little bit deeper that in that paper in

521
00:24:41,849 --> 00:24:45,689
that research they used the NIA so tunic

522
00:24:43,888 --> 00:24:49,288
lie between the indica and the

523
00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:51,808
temperature Monica and and based on that

524
00:24:49,288 --> 00:24:54,898
like I I just want to know that what are

525
00:24:51,808 --> 00:24:58,740
the what are the resistant genes that

526
00:24:54,898 --> 00:25:00,989
link to these markers so the linkage

527
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:05,519
disequilibrium in indica is around 100

528
00:25:00,990 --> 00:25:06,870
KB and the LD for the temperature punica

529
00:25:05,519 --> 00:25:12,298
is 200 Kb

530
00:25:06,869 --> 00:25:14,878
so I just used the 200 k be read 200 KB

531
00:25:12,298 --> 00:25:17,220
linkage disequilibrium here to just

532
00:25:14,878 --> 00:25:21,599
satisfy that what are the genes that

533
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:26,278
link to these 13 snips marker so I just

534
00:25:21,599 --> 00:25:27,898
search it in the phyto so database and I

535
00:25:26,278 --> 00:25:29,700
found that there are two hundred seventy

536
00:25:27,898 --> 00:25:31,979
eight genes that linked to these 13

537
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:34,860
markers and half of them are annotated

538
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:38,548
and other half is not and interestingly

539
00:25:34,859 --> 00:25:41,609
most of the frequent heat that was

540
00:25:38,548 --> 00:25:44,308
showing to me including the leucine-rich

541
00:25:41,609 --> 00:25:47,250
repeat family protein and nucleotide

542
00:25:44,308 --> 00:25:51,480
binding lives in which repeat here of

543
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:55,230
like showing the most out of out of 270

544
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:59,370
h1 and these two proteins and well known

545
00:25:55,230 --> 00:26:01,970
for its its its function as a are teen

546
00:25:59,369 --> 00:26:06,479
because it's detecting the pathogen

547
00:26:01,970 --> 00:26:09,058
another most heat protein is the the

548
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:10,980
peroxidase precursor peroxidase it's

549
00:26:09,058 --> 00:26:14,339
quite important in terms of the

550
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:17,339
resistant or these pathogen to this

551
00:26:14,339 --> 00:26:20,099
pathogen because this the vibrates or IC

552
00:26:17,339 --> 00:26:22,619
is a neck wrote off so it used it used

553
00:26:20,099 --> 00:26:25,349
the program sale days that

554
00:26:22,619 --> 00:26:27,808
that related to real reactive oxygen

555
00:26:25,349 --> 00:26:30,869
species in the in the mechanism of the

556
00:26:27,808 --> 00:26:33,720
acceptability so this is important for

557
00:26:30,869 --> 00:26:35,308
that the written it the reason is also

558
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:39,450
important in terms of the lignin

559
00:26:35,308 --> 00:26:42,930
synthesis that it prevent the infection

560
00:26:39,450 --> 00:26:45,840
for this disease the my B protein it's

561
00:26:42,930 --> 00:26:49,740
very well known for its resistant

562
00:26:45,839 --> 00:26:53,789
capacity that it responds to most biotic

563
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:56,279
and abiotic stress in general disease so

564
00:26:53,789 --> 00:26:58,558
based on these two hundred eighty seven

565
00:26:56,279 --> 00:27:00,990
genes I just put up all of the sequence

566
00:26:58,558 --> 00:27:03,480
and blast back to so because this based

567
00:27:00,990 --> 00:27:05,339
on the rice data so I pour out of these

568
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:08,549
gene sequence and blast back to the

569
00:27:05,339 --> 00:27:10,500
switchgrass switchgrass database and I

570
00:27:08,549 --> 00:27:14,220
found that the top 10 percent score of

571
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:16,079
those blast hit there's still like 1400

572
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:17,519
genes out of that so at least I have

573
00:27:16,079 --> 00:27:19,319
some hope that there should be some

574
00:27:17,519 --> 00:27:22,859
resistant genes in in switchgrass

575
00:27:19,319 --> 00:27:25,678
population so at this point I try to

576
00:27:22,859 --> 00:27:29,459
dissect the resistant 2 by 3 leaf spot

577
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:32,400
by using the genome-wide Association so

578
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:34,019
I went back to the first step that I

579
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:37,320
would not working with the seedlings

580
00:27:34,019 --> 00:27:39,329
anymore it give me everything so I

581
00:27:37,319 --> 00:27:43,259
worked with a mature plant that I've

582
00:27:39,329 --> 00:27:46,740
I've got a chance to to evaluate this in

583
00:27:43,259 --> 00:27:49,650
in a mature plan that was already a

584
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:53,009
genotype so the population that I use is

585
00:27:49,650 --> 00:27:56,100
a shoosh grass not an association panel

586
00:27:53,009 --> 00:28:00,869
that is consists of 66 population that

587
00:27:56,099 --> 00:28:03,178
both both the commercialized cultivars

588
00:28:00,869 --> 00:28:04,919
from switchgrass or or some of them are

589
00:28:03,179 --> 00:28:07,500
also the natural collection of the

590
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:10,050
switchgrass and though from from those

591
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:14,039
population we plant five to six seeds

592
00:28:10,049 --> 00:28:20,669
for each population into individual so

593
00:28:14,039 --> 00:28:24,450
in total I have 470 19 and in 2000 2016

594
00:28:20,670 --> 00:28:27,090
we planted in Ithaca and in in in

595
00:28:24,450 --> 00:28:29,009
Phillipsburg in Pennsylvania for three

596
00:28:27,089 --> 00:28:32,759
clones and just last year we was

597
00:28:29,009 --> 00:28:35,670
suspended in in rocker so but but these

598
00:28:32,759 --> 00:28:36,390
this data it's only from last year data

599
00:28:35,670 --> 00:28:39,808
because

600
00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:42,750
we have one year left so I was having

601
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:46,009
only one chance in two locations so at

602
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:49,710
this point at this point at with the 66

603
00:28:46,009 --> 00:28:53,308
population in 479 I just want to the

604
00:28:49,710 --> 00:28:55,079
goal is was was to screening tutors

605
00:28:53,308 --> 00:28:57,379
identify what's the best candidate for

606
00:28:55,079 --> 00:29:00,178
the resistant out of this population and

607
00:28:57,380 --> 00:29:02,490
what because all of these has been

608
00:29:00,179 --> 00:29:06,390
genotyped already what are the what are

609
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:10,740
the the the marker the snips marker that

610
00:29:06,390 --> 00:29:13,610
links to potential resistant gene to the

611
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:18,058
by price or ice vibrating spot

612
00:29:13,609 --> 00:29:19,829
so the so at first it's the easiest way

613
00:29:18,058 --> 00:29:22,649
to evaluate the disease just walk

614
00:29:19,829 --> 00:29:26,279
through fear right so I evaluate by just

615
00:29:22,650 --> 00:29:30,330
using my eyes I evaluate with the score

616
00:29:26,279 --> 00:29:34,470
from 0 to 5 in the field and we start

617
00:29:30,329 --> 00:29:37,409
showing like this that each so I

618
00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:39,679
represent these result in 66 population

619
00:29:37,410 --> 00:29:43,259
each bar represents 66 population and

620
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:46,470
it's coded by the different eco type a

621
00:29:43,259 --> 00:29:48,480
plan and lowland and this order based

622
00:29:46,470 --> 00:29:51,089
and this power order based on the mean

623
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:53,789
from two locations and as you can see

624
00:29:51,089 --> 00:29:56,159
here there's no like there's no similar

625
00:29:53,789 --> 00:29:58,440
trend between the based on true mean

626
00:29:56,160 --> 00:30:00,980
from two location with the mean from

627
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:04,440
just New York and mean from from

628
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:06,000
Pennsylvania and that's it's just that

629
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:08,789
showing me that it's a huge

630
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:11,880
environmental effects to the resistant

631
00:30:08,789 --> 00:30:14,789
to vibrate leaf spot so I come up with

632
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:17,460
the so I try to evaluate I try to

633
00:30:14,789 --> 00:30:19,200
eliminate those environmental effect by

634
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:22,308
just taking the leap sample back to the

635
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:26,548
back to the lab and and sprayed it and

636
00:30:22,308 --> 00:30:28,589
inoculated did so I did into two si in

637
00:30:26,548 --> 00:30:33,500
the leaf detachment assay and the leaf

638
00:30:28,589 --> 00:30:36,659
is actually for the leaf it hashman si I

639
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:40,230
basically just cut to 5 centimeters so

640
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:42,540
first real I sprayed it 70 like over 7

641
00:30:40,230 --> 00:30:46,950
days and you've elevated and also like

642
00:30:42,539 --> 00:30:48,980
scan each leaf scan each leaf and use

643
00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:53,450
image analysis to

644
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:57,259
like to detect the the deletion so you

645
00:30:53,450 --> 00:30:59,240
may notice that like I use the disease

646
00:30:57,259 --> 00:31:01,278
it's in the dot right a black dot but I

647
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:03,620
like alright so I can based on these

648
00:31:01,278 --> 00:31:05,409
pictures I can extract lots of data out

649
00:31:03,619 --> 00:31:09,018
of that it's just a black dog or just

650
00:31:05,409 --> 00:31:11,360
overall necrosis but in this in this one

651
00:31:09,019 --> 00:31:14,329
I show you the overall necrosis that

652
00:31:11,359 --> 00:31:16,658
showing and that we saw it's pretty high

653
00:31:14,329 --> 00:31:19,278
correlated with my eye data eyes

654
00:31:16,659 --> 00:31:21,830
evaluation but I know that's not a good

655
00:31:19,278 --> 00:31:23,750
like candidate from the result that I

656
00:31:21,829 --> 00:31:26,750
give you like non significant we saw

657
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:31,250
previously another evaluation that I did

658
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:35,808
was using the leaf teas essay that I

659
00:31:31,250 --> 00:31:38,148
just call the leaf into - yeah like one

660
00:31:35,808 --> 00:31:39,950
centimeters and put in the water and

661
00:31:38,148 --> 00:31:42,949
take pictures of that and using

662
00:31:39,950 --> 00:31:45,110
nationalise image j to extract each leaf

663
00:31:42,950 --> 00:31:47,600
circle and evaluate like the similar

664
00:31:45,109 --> 00:31:50,538
things also and that's a high

665
00:31:47,599 --> 00:31:53,719
correlation at point seven with like

666
00:31:50,538 --> 00:31:56,990
coil it with my eyes result and based on

667
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:58,819
these i can evaluate all right so the so

668
00:31:56,990 --> 00:32:02,509
i evaluate a brush and hurt ability and

669
00:31:58,819 --> 00:32:04,579
this time it's showing very high boston

670
00:32:02,509 --> 00:32:08,000
horrific hurt ability at point seven

671
00:32:04,579 --> 00:32:10,720
point five keep skip this one and point

672
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,720
three and five

673
00:32:11,388 --> 00:32:14,658
i skip this one because you remember

674
00:32:13,159 --> 00:32:17,510
that there's a huge environment so

675
00:32:14,659 --> 00:32:20,000
effect here that you you have the high

676
00:32:17,509 --> 00:32:21,908
high heritability in each location but

677
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:27,349
when you combine consider two location

678
00:32:21,909 --> 00:32:29,269
where are you so that's the koi so so

679
00:32:27,349 --> 00:32:32,359
even though I have this high cool high

680
00:32:29,269 --> 00:32:36,859
fertility from each evaluation

681
00:32:32,359 --> 00:32:39,788
approaches but when I tried but when I

682
00:32:36,859 --> 00:32:43,428
try to just rank it by the public by the

683
00:32:39,788 --> 00:32:47,359
DTI ia is the result from the dish

684
00:32:43,429 --> 00:32:50,120
please and detached leaf with the image

685
00:32:47,359 --> 00:32:52,490
analysis one so I rank this by based on

686
00:32:50,119 --> 00:32:55,308
the tree they have leaf results and you

687
00:32:52,490 --> 00:32:58,519
see the let's do like no no trend with

688
00:32:55,308 --> 00:33:02,418
this leaf and no trend with the mean of

689
00:32:58,519 --> 00:33:06,230
two locations from two locations

690
00:33:02,419 --> 00:33:09,070
and this and this showing that like

691
00:33:06,230 --> 00:33:12,159
there's no correlation even with the the

692
00:33:09,069 --> 00:33:14,778
within the risk evaluation for the

693
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:16,609
resistant to by priya leaf spot there's

694
00:33:14,778 --> 00:33:18,558
no correlation between that like this

695
00:33:16,608 --> 00:33:22,808
high correlation is between the my eyes

696
00:33:18,558 --> 00:33:25,398
and the bitchin and beyond the the

697
00:33:22,808 --> 00:33:27,589
resistant to bacterial leaf spot there's

698
00:33:25,398 --> 00:33:30,979
also like no correlation with other by

699
00:33:27,589 --> 00:33:33,589
by biomass rates as the mineral content

700
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:36,440
the digestibility the cell wall

701
00:33:33,589 --> 00:33:40,488
concentration or the the ethanol yield

702
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:42,048
i'm from the dry biomass so based on the

703
00:33:40,489 --> 00:33:45,350
fact that there's no correlation based

704
00:33:42,048 --> 00:33:48,440
on this i the way that I fit the G was I

705
00:33:45,349 --> 00:33:50,329
was trying to just fit it as by itself

706
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:52,249
by its single trait or just a

707
00:33:50,329 --> 00:33:57,259
combination of the like plots of traits

708
00:33:52,249 --> 00:34:00,858
and I also include the the third the

709
00:33:57,259 --> 00:34:03,679
first three principal component that can

710
00:34:00,858 --> 00:34:05,599
explain around 15 percent variation in

711
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:09,710
this population and also use a kinship

712
00:34:05,599 --> 00:34:12,679
metrics as a random effects and the Audi

713
00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:16,579
the linkage disequilibrium that if it's

714
00:34:12,679 --> 00:34:20,898
that give the idea how how how why this

715
00:34:16,579 --> 00:34:22,309
is the gene the link to the the the

716
00:34:20,898 --> 00:34:28,548
marker that I used and in this

717
00:34:22,309 --> 00:34:30,710
population is 20 kilo base pair so as I

718
00:34:28,548 --> 00:34:33,889
mentioned earlier that the way that I

719
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:35,929
fit g was is I was trying to just fit

720
00:34:33,889 --> 00:34:38,088
the single trait of itself and the

721
00:34:35,929 --> 00:34:41,329
combination of many traits there from

722
00:34:38,088 --> 00:34:44,750
the from the detach Lee from the Beasley

723
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:48,019
from the EU and everything and more than

724
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:50,108
90 percent of of my tea was non

725
00:34:48,019 --> 00:34:53,539
significant non significant kicked and

726
00:34:50,108 --> 00:34:56,509
like or or even though or some of them

727
00:34:53,539 --> 00:34:58,608
just like give me the very very

728
00:34:56,510 --> 00:35:00,650
unreliable QQ plot that some of them

729
00:34:58,608 --> 00:35:04,130
left the panel too early some of them

730
00:35:00,650 --> 00:35:07,430
just like smoothie normal they didn't

731
00:35:04,130 --> 00:35:07,640
show me the significant but but some

732
00:35:07,429 --> 00:35:10,759
more

733
00:35:07,639 --> 00:35:14,869
you show me like some home let's do

734
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:18,770
something in my research so I also based

735
00:35:14,869 --> 00:35:21,949
on because I have like 479 population I

736
00:35:18,769 --> 00:35:24,409
subset in those 400 sets every night you

737
00:35:21,949 --> 00:35:27,529
know types into like many many groups

738
00:35:24,409 --> 00:35:29,449
the the first one is just I used like

739
00:35:27,530 --> 00:35:32,300
the whole thing with the combination of

740
00:35:29,449 --> 00:35:35,389
the detach leaf and this leaf and the

741
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:38,330
maximum in New York State I used maximum

742
00:35:35,389 --> 00:35:40,609
the value from the few evaluation which

743
00:35:38,329 --> 00:35:43,190
is the most severe in the field because

744
00:35:40,610 --> 00:35:45,710
none of the black or none of the mean

745
00:35:43,190 --> 00:35:48,710
from the few evaluation show me the

746
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:51,530
significant results of the team of the

747
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:56,449
device at all and I used the maximum

748
00:35:51,530 --> 00:35:59,450
because Washington in in and pathology

749
00:35:56,449 --> 00:36:00,769
suggested me to do this that hey you

750
00:35:59,449 --> 00:36:03,230
don't need to think as a plant breeder

751
00:36:00,769 --> 00:36:04,969
or a time you need to think as a hunter

752
00:36:03,230 --> 00:36:06,710
ecology sometime that if you have the

753
00:36:04,969 --> 00:36:09,230
plants in the same field that you have

754
00:36:06,710 --> 00:36:11,269
three replicates one of them show no

755
00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:13,219
symptom one of them show the words why

756
00:36:11,269 --> 00:36:15,199
don't you just pick the worst one like

757
00:36:13,219 --> 00:36:17,029
they consider that's the worst case so

758
00:36:15,199 --> 00:36:21,379
that's why I consider using the maximum

759
00:36:17,030 --> 00:36:24,700
value and it's showing showing something

760
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:27,530
here that some significant peak here is

761
00:36:24,699 --> 00:36:31,549
related to antioxidant protein which is

762
00:36:27,530 --> 00:36:35,180
very good in terms of the resistant to

763
00:36:31,550 --> 00:36:39,769
vibrate vibrate leaves more my be which

764
00:36:35,179 --> 00:36:43,549
is related to the bio bio biotic and

765
00:36:39,769 --> 00:36:45,820
abiotic stress the the disc and this one

766
00:36:43,550 --> 00:36:50,420
the ring finger this is related to

767
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:53,059
program so date the and DST the GU da

768
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:57,349
hai own s transferase it's also related

769
00:36:53,059 --> 00:37:00,049
to the antioxidant activities the the

770
00:36:57,349 --> 00:37:04,579
most important piece here is this one I

771
00:37:00,050 --> 00:37:06,710
know that it's not like the Mike G was

772
00:37:04,579 --> 00:37:08,599
didn't provide like the very Manhattan

773
00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:10,730
part like the significant P like that

774
00:37:08,599 --> 00:37:14,199
but these showing me the most

775
00:37:10,730 --> 00:37:18,199
interesting one because the cytochrome

776
00:37:14,199 --> 00:37:20,299
p450 is the only one only one key that

777
00:37:18,199 --> 00:37:21,529
overlap with the blast result that I got

778
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:23,420
from rice that I used the

779
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:25,430
the infirm rise and a blast back to the

780
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:28,309
to the switchgrass and this is the only

781
00:37:25,429 --> 00:37:32,089
one that overlap with that data and the

782
00:37:28,309 --> 00:37:35,119
importance of this by the compy 450 450

783
00:37:32,090 --> 00:37:37,640
it's it's synthesized for four

784
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:40,909
triterpene triterpene is also well known

785
00:37:37,639 --> 00:37:42,769
for like the antifungal activities such

786
00:37:40,909 --> 00:37:47,089
the most well known triterpene is a

787
00:37:42,769 --> 00:37:50,599
venison in oat that is also like also

788
00:37:47,090 --> 00:37:53,210
resistant to act as a antifungal

789
00:37:50,599 --> 00:37:59,089
activities - and now the subset is the

790
00:37:53,210 --> 00:38:02,990
data ploy in this switchgrass so I fit

791
00:37:59,090 --> 00:38:06,140
this so the data ploy showing the only

792
00:38:02,989 --> 00:38:08,119
devices showing the significant from the

793
00:38:06,139 --> 00:38:10,159
data place update if the maximum value

794
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:11,750
in the few in New York State and is

795
00:38:10,159 --> 00:38:15,349
showing that it links with the program

796
00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:17,559
so did protein and also the protein that

797
00:38:15,349 --> 00:38:20,420
induced in their cross is one here

798
00:38:17,559 --> 00:38:23,449
another subset is the subset of the

799
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:27,079
lowland that it also shows that the

800
00:38:23,449 --> 00:38:30,049
antifungal proteins here and here it's

801
00:38:27,079 --> 00:38:32,299
linked with in this peak linked with the

802
00:38:30,050 --> 00:38:34,370
nucleotide binding SIA use in which

803
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:37,970
repeat protein which is also well known

804
00:38:34,369 --> 00:38:43,460
for acting as an r RG r protein that

805
00:38:37,969 --> 00:38:46,039
detector detects a pathogen so for the a

806
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:48,650
plant it's just showing only one piece

807
00:38:46,039 --> 00:38:52,360
here that link to BW 40 even though

808
00:38:48,650 --> 00:38:55,309
there's no like study like directly

809
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:58,099
directly say that this is like related

810
00:38:55,309 --> 00:38:59,840
to any plant disease but it's also but

811
00:38:58,099 --> 00:39:02,569
this is very important for a

812
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:08,920
biosynthesis for my beef protein which

813
00:39:02,570 --> 00:39:10,130
is also linked to the the and stress and

814
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:12,500
base

815
00:39:10,130 --> 00:39:16,400
on this although like as you as you know

816
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:18,949
that like I have most of my Tevas non

817
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:21,079
significantly different non-secure none

818
00:39:18,949 --> 00:39:24,949
like didn't give me a significant result

819
00:39:21,079 --> 00:39:27,230
but the the significant she was that I

820
00:39:24,949 --> 00:39:31,189
have here there's no overlap Peaks out

821
00:39:27,230 --> 00:39:34,250
of this population at all which is it's

822
00:39:31,190 --> 00:39:36,108
not it's not an ideal result but at

823
00:39:34,250 --> 00:39:38,329
least it's better than just zero

824
00:39:36,108 --> 00:39:42,230
heritability and non non progress of

825
00:39:38,329 --> 00:39:44,269
from the selection and there's a showing

826
00:39:42,230 --> 00:39:46,338
up like the key which that they're

827
00:39:44,268 --> 00:39:49,129
showing up that beast and when I

828
00:39:46,338 --> 00:39:53,358
compared I consider over all of these

829
00:39:49,130 --> 00:39:55,099
give us this the showing up the the key

830
00:39:53,358 --> 00:39:57,619
genes that link that link to these

831
00:39:55,099 --> 00:40:00,769
markers that is reasonably research that

832
00:39:57,619 --> 00:40:03,380
can convert resistant to the capacitor

833
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:05,899
to this disease resistant to this

834
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:08,358
disease but it's still missing some

835
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:11,119
genes that I expect to see like dilatant

836
00:40:08,358 --> 00:40:14,838
that linked that is linked to the

837
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:19,309
Dyckman synthesis the peroxidase ml all

838
00:40:14,838 --> 00:40:24,139
like proteins and the only only fits in

839
00:40:19,309 --> 00:40:26,390
on chromosome B from the 479 here it's

840
00:40:24,139 --> 00:40:31,068
linked with the blast results from

841
00:40:26,389 --> 00:40:33,440
previous from the rice and based on

842
00:40:31,068 --> 00:40:35,509
these let's get back to the goal for the

843
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:38,019
study of this that the first goal is

844
00:40:35,509 --> 00:40:41,358
trying to identify the most resistant

845
00:40:38,018 --> 00:40:45,439
genotypes or population in this in this

846
00:40:41,358 --> 00:40:48,048
66 population but as you remember that

847
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:51,170
this like none of the phenotypic

848
00:40:48,048 --> 00:40:53,568
approaches here has like has correlation

849
00:40:51,170 --> 00:40:55,670
between each other that's why I like I

850
00:40:53,568 --> 00:40:58,338
can I cannot make the conclusive

851
00:40:55,670 --> 00:41:01,430
decision that okay this one is the best

852
00:40:58,338 --> 00:41:04,730
out of all of them in all hi Tyria but

853
00:41:01,429 --> 00:41:07,639
if I need to if I need to put people if

854
00:41:04,730 --> 00:41:08,389
I need to pick the most the best one

855
00:41:07,639 --> 00:41:12,048
right now

856
00:41:08,389 --> 00:41:14,239
I will pick SW 805 because it's always

857
00:41:12,048 --> 00:41:16,389
on the top top 10 percent of this

858
00:41:14,239 --> 00:41:16,389
population

859
00:41:16,909 --> 00:41:22,670
and and the multitrack she was here

860
00:41:20,659 --> 00:41:26,779
really helps me to review some of the

861
00:41:22,670 --> 00:41:30,590
some of the some of the slips marker

862
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:36,500
that is that is linked to the resistant

863
00:41:30,590 --> 00:41:40,280
in reasonably so at this point it's the

864
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:43,219
end of my reading part that I try so

865
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:47,450
hard to breed to breed for these trades

866
00:41:43,219 --> 00:41:49,730
and um and but don't forget that we

867
00:41:47,449 --> 00:41:52,489
still can manage this disease by another

868
00:41:49,730 --> 00:41:56,719
approaches and in this recent year

869
00:41:52,489 --> 00:42:00,109
there's a trend to implement silicone to

870
00:41:56,719 --> 00:42:03,679
to rise to be resistant to vibrate by

871
00:42:00,110 --> 00:42:07,039
prairies leaf spot and it has been

872
00:42:03,679 --> 00:42:09,889
proved that this silicon can can court

873
00:42:07,039 --> 00:42:11,989
the Seidman sorry can cut the leaves to

874
00:42:09,889 --> 00:42:13,969
prevent the the attacked of the

875
00:42:11,989 --> 00:42:17,750
intrusion of this pathogen like

876
00:42:13,969 --> 00:42:20,419
physically and also these silicon can

877
00:42:17,750 --> 00:42:22,550
trigger the the defense mechanism

878
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:26,090
molecule such as such as Munich s just

879
00:42:22,550 --> 00:42:28,250
like acid or salicylic acid lastly it's

880
00:42:26,090 --> 00:42:31,940
quite surprising that it's they also

881
00:42:28,250 --> 00:42:34,730
prove that the silicon can prevent the

882
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:38,119
take that taking over of the ethylene

883
00:42:34,730 --> 00:42:42,260
production from from rice so I have and

884
00:42:38,119 --> 00:42:45,859
based on these that's a star D to screen

885
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:47,630
the to screen to screen the gene in Kelo

886
00:42:45,860 --> 00:42:50,000
switchgrass and they they found that

887
00:42:47,630 --> 00:42:53,809
there there are at least two two key

888
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:57,440
genes in in translocating for silicon in

889
00:42:53,809 --> 00:42:59,900
switchgrass LS I won and LSI to so based

890
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:01,970
on this knowledge I had some hope that

891
00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:04,190
okay even though I didn't make any

892
00:43:01,969 --> 00:43:06,289
progress from the selection I can make

893
00:43:04,190 --> 00:43:08,570
progress from testifying silicon to

894
00:43:06,289 --> 00:43:11,570
switchgrass and make it more resistant

895
00:43:08,570 --> 00:43:13,970
here but there's a concern about the

896
00:43:11,570 --> 00:43:18,380
appliance which silicon to switchgrass -

897
00:43:13,969 --> 00:43:20,299
because Swiss grad was was aimed to use

898
00:43:18,380 --> 00:43:23,000
for the biomass right so we basically

899
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:23,539
want to burned it or turn it into

900
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,760
ethanol

901
00:43:23,539 --> 00:43:28,429
if you want to burned it this silicon

902
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:30,650
the highest silicon amount can I can

903
00:43:28,429 --> 00:43:33,049
melt at five hundred or seven to seven

904
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:35,599
hundred degrees Celsius and clockers and

905
00:43:33,050 --> 00:43:38,180
create the slack like this ten o'clock

906
00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:40,849
the heating system so that's like the

907
00:43:38,179 --> 00:43:45,230
implement of silicon into Swiss bed it's

908
00:43:40,849 --> 00:43:47,869
also concerned too and these are the

909
00:43:45,230 --> 00:43:51,469
just a basic idea of how many how much

910
00:43:47,869 --> 00:43:53,480
how much silicon in the in the tissue of

911
00:43:51,469 --> 00:43:55,399
this plant and you can see here like

912
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:58,579
Swiss quartz is already high higher than

913
00:43:55,400 --> 00:44:00,829
Miscanthus which is also another biomass

914
00:43:58,579 --> 00:44:04,360
crop too but it's still lower than dry

915
00:44:00,829 --> 00:44:09,110
so maybe it's silicon may not hurt this

916
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:12,079
but but we should not a good side the

917
00:44:09,110 --> 00:44:14,450
results show that there's no there's no

918
00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:19,639
effect of the silicon amendment to the

919
00:44:14,449 --> 00:44:22,789
to the resistant to either vcss I try to

920
00:44:19,639 --> 00:44:26,869
to mix the silicon powder with the saw

921
00:44:22,789 --> 00:44:29,539
and with the soy and find the fan fan

922
00:44:26,869 --> 00:44:32,019
switchgrass there and taste the vibrates

923
00:44:29,539 --> 00:44:36,289
it but there's a back release but there

924
00:44:32,019 --> 00:44:39,409
there's no significant effect on that

925
00:44:36,289 --> 00:44:41,509
even though like so the the the yellow

926
00:44:39,409 --> 00:44:42,969
block yellow yellow bar here represent

927
00:44:41,510 --> 00:44:45,410
the silicon one and the blue by is

928
00:44:42,969 --> 00:44:46,969
control one even though it looks like

929
00:44:45,409 --> 00:44:50,690
significantly different but when we

930
00:44:46,969 --> 00:44:54,259
taste statically statistically it's not

931
00:44:50,690 --> 00:44:55,820
like significant different and so okay

932
00:44:54,260 --> 00:44:58,220
there may be like some saw a mixing

933
00:44:55,820 --> 00:45:01,100
problem so I try to just water the

934
00:44:58,219 --> 00:45:04,519
silicon solution to to them to and

935
00:45:01,099 --> 00:45:08,089
there's no like no improvement between

936
00:45:04,519 --> 00:45:14,509
between silicon and the control one so

937
00:45:08,090 --> 00:45:16,640
at this point I think I'm cursed so

938
00:45:14,510 --> 00:45:19,550
there's no improvement but there's quite

939
00:45:16,639 --> 00:45:22,489
some explanation on these two that there

940
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:25,310
might be a low retention of piece of

941
00:45:22,489 --> 00:45:27,559
this silicon in the I didn't use the so

942
00:45:25,309 --> 00:45:31,639
I use a corny Opie like medium so there

943
00:45:27,559 --> 00:45:33,340
may be low retention on that and like

944
00:45:31,639 --> 00:45:35,449
there's no biological like for the

945
00:45:33,340 --> 00:45:38,420
resistant to back release it got this

946
00:45:35,449 --> 00:45:40,309
like watering silicon when it's seeds it

947
00:45:38,420 --> 00:45:43,400
may not have any biological effects on

948
00:45:40,309 --> 00:45:45,710
that lastly like this

949
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:48,318
that I use for screening for vibrate

950
00:45:45,710 --> 00:45:50,389
leaf spot may not be like enough they

951
00:45:48,318 --> 00:45:53,509
may not be appropriate for the silicon

952
00:45:50,389 --> 00:45:56,449
to accumulate like the in the in the

953
00:45:53,510 --> 00:45:59,359
tissue already but I need we need to

954
00:45:56,449 --> 00:46:01,669
keep in mind that this result it's the

955
00:45:59,358 --> 00:46:04,068
it's a greenhouse result so it cannot be

956
00:46:01,670 --> 00:46:06,740
infer the effect of this silicon

957
00:46:04,068 --> 00:46:07,460
amendment in the field so if anyone want

958
00:46:06,739 --> 00:46:09,769
to try this

959
00:46:07,460 --> 00:46:13,699
thank you welcome to continue this

960
00:46:09,769 --> 00:46:15,500
research so overall for my research I

961
00:46:13,699 --> 00:46:18,739
would like to conclude that as a plant

962
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:20,989
breeder I'm pretty proud of of the

963
00:46:18,739 --> 00:46:23,568
improvement of the resistant to by free

964
00:46:20,989 --> 00:46:25,669
seed brought that it's increased like

965
00:46:23,568 --> 00:46:28,940
come on sixty percent and fifty percent

966
00:46:25,670 --> 00:46:31,338
of each cycle of selection is so high or

967
00:46:28,940 --> 00:46:34,700
the disease resistant but I have to

968
00:46:31,338 --> 00:46:36,288
admit that the I'm the resistant to buy

969
00:46:34,699 --> 00:46:39,318
three leaf spots still need to be

970
00:46:36,289 --> 00:46:41,270
improved and screen since the screening

971
00:46:39,318 --> 00:46:45,889
techniques and even though I try to

972
00:46:41,269 --> 00:46:49,009
screen in the in actual plant it's it's

973
00:46:45,889 --> 00:46:51,739
do like those marker does come from the

974
00:46:49,010 --> 00:46:54,770
multi trait that you ask cannot directly

975
00:46:51,739 --> 00:46:57,259
use for the genomic selected a genomic

976
00:46:54,769 --> 00:47:00,519
existed selection right now it's doing

977
00:46:57,260 --> 00:47:05,240
it for its you need to be validating a

978
00:47:00,519 --> 00:47:07,759
bit and lastly for silicon amendment we

979
00:47:05,239 --> 00:47:09,588
cannot infer in the greenhouse result to

980
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:14,599
the few results so that might be the

981
00:47:09,588 --> 00:47:16,940
future research again lastly I cannot

982
00:47:14,599 --> 00:47:19,789
stand here and live in America for five

983
00:47:16,940 --> 00:47:21,650
years without the financial funding from

984

the promotes the development and

985
00:47:21,650 --> 00:47:28,190
promotion of Science and Technology from

986
00:47:24,170 --> 00:47:31,159
Thailand and also I cannot be here and

987
00:47:28,190 --> 00:47:34,579
make sense of my research without my my

988
00:47:31,159 --> 00:47:38,269
committee members don't fine Gary Brooks

989
00:47:34,579 --> 00:47:41,690
Tommy neo Max and also my like I cannot

990
00:47:38,269 --> 00:47:45,139
plant odd of those like four five

991
00:47:41,690 --> 00:47:47,778
hundred of those plants in the few every

992
00:47:45,139 --> 00:47:51,469
year without a hill top of the forest

993

995
00:47:56,719 --> 00:47:59,209
group in

996
00:47:57,380 --> 00:48:02,599
Gary's left or helping me with the

997
00:47:59,210 --> 00:48:05,409
deceit part and also the plant material

998
00:48:02,599 --> 00:48:08,809
and the genotype data from my castle and

999
00:48:05,409 --> 00:48:11,088
all of my sip by sip friends that I

1000
00:48:08,809 --> 00:48:13,579
cannot have out of this idea by just

1001
00:48:11,088 --> 00:48:15,920
sitting by myself I got lots of ideas

1002
00:48:13,579 --> 00:48:18,798
from from you all so thank you so much

1003
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:22,068
for having me here and welcome for any

1004
00:48:18,798 --> 00:48:24,259
questions and if you want to have any

1005
00:48:22,068 --> 00:48:46,278
comments very welcome to email me if I -

1006
00:48:24,259 --> 00:48:49,248
thank you so much how expensive is the

1007
00:48:46,278 --> 00:48:53,179
silicon it madman seems like that might

1008
00:48:49,248 --> 00:48:56,568
be an additional objection honest how

1009
00:48:53,179 --> 00:49:10,098
expensive is silicon you know I don't I

1010
00:48:56,568 --> 00:49:14,268
didn't follow those and you know there's

1011
00:49:10,099 --> 00:49:16,338
different ways of adding it and one way

1012
00:49:14,268 --> 00:49:19,248
is actually using rice balls for apps

1013
00:49:16,338 --> 00:49:22,219
price calls so I think the ideal is to

1014
00:49:19,248 --> 00:49:26,139
use these the where where are silicon

1015
00:49:22,219 --> 00:49:26,139
already degree that's a waste stream

1016
00:49:27,728 --> 00:49:31,429
thank you

1017
00:49:29,210 --> 00:49:42,679
if there were any additional questions

1018
00:49:31,429 --> 00:49:46,429
for you this has been a production of

1019
00:49:42,679 --> 00:49:49,118
