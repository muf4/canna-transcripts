1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,309
this is a production of Cornell

2
00:00:01,679 --> 00:00:04,309
University

3
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:13,910
thank you so much to Alina and Mike and

4
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:16,699
organizers we are real joy to be here

5
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:19,070
it's my first trip to the makeup plant

6
00:00:16,699 --> 00:00:22,070
science in the US I am really really

7
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:25,850
excited so before I show you some of the

8
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:29,920
phenotyping data let me explain what the

9
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:33,800
plan imaging consortium is so we are

10
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:37,010
consortium of Arkansas and mr. ebay sign

11
00:00:33,799 --> 00:00:42,259
these were funded by the NSF EPSCoR

12
00:00:37,009 --> 00:00:45,289
track to a program and basically we are

13
00:00:42,259 --> 00:00:48,890
as a group of plant scientists who came

14
00:00:45,289 --> 00:00:51,109
together convinced of the importance of

15
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:54,018
plant a tree pod phenotyping and other

16
00:00:51,109 --> 00:00:56,030
imaging tools and what the project

17
00:00:54,018 --> 00:01:01,908
allowed us to do is really open the

18
00:00:56,030 --> 00:01:05,329
access to some from an interesting

19
00:01:01,908 --> 00:01:07,629
essence hydropathy no typing and other

20
00:01:05,329 --> 00:01:10,670
imaging technologies to really empower

21
00:01:07,629 --> 00:01:12,729
discoveries in plan stressed biology so

22
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:17,390
I want to acknowledge some of my

23
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:19,550
colleagues dr. day there are three

24
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:22,400
scientific elite in history and two in

25
00:01:19,549 --> 00:01:25,789
Arkansas in history the leads are Sylvia

26
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:28,280
Jewison jontron PI and they with brawn

27
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:34,520
and in Arkansas the leads are key an

28
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:36,980
evolving and myself and again I'll tell

29
00:01:34,519 --> 00:01:40,340
you more about it this is our website

30
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:44,390
and among the things that we have done

31
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:46,130
is funded young scientists and I learned

32
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:47,810
yesterday that you are getting an

33
00:01:46,129 --> 00:01:50,449
excellent one coming through

34
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:51,469
Cornell coming back to Cornell so that's

35
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:53,810
wonderful

36
00:01:51,469 --> 00:01:56,090
you are going to see also here Noah for

37
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:58,700
green and Malia Jehan these are two very

38
00:01:56,090 --> 00:02:01,370
talented scientists and they got some

39
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:04,189
funding from our consortium to really

40
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:06,530
develop further plans TV which is an

41
00:02:04,189 --> 00:02:08,329
open source software and is really a

42
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:09,769
community resource where you can

43
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:14,200
contribute and I'm going to show you

44
00:02:09,769 --> 00:02:18,020
what we have contribute to this field

45
00:02:14,199 --> 00:02:20,149
okay so I'm pretty sure that

46
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:22,990
I'm preaching here to the choir is that

47
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:26,090
all of these are biotic stresses and

48
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:31,159
also of course biotic stresses present a

49
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:33,379
big challenge to agriculture and we need

50
00:02:31,159 --> 00:02:36,560
better ways to measure plant performance

51
00:02:33,379 --> 00:02:39,199
and these interactions the genes by

52
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:42,080
environment interaction to do that we

53
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:45,169
are are convinced and I believe top

54
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:47,390
talked already show us digital signal

55
00:02:45,169 --> 00:02:50,780
typing is a very powerful tool because

56
00:02:47,389 --> 00:02:54,019
you go beyond the resolution of the

57
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:55,550
human eyes to really extract all of this

58
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:59,540
important information out of these

59
00:02:55,550 --> 00:03:04,430
images so let me discuss the platform

60
00:02:59,539 --> 00:03:07,189
art so in Arkansas there is 50 plant

61
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:10,819
scientists throughout the state you have

62
00:03:07,189 --> 00:03:13,219
here a treasure you have a new right

63
00:03:10,819 --> 00:03:15,590
we are filthy and we're scattered in

64
00:03:13,219 --> 00:03:18,620
five different universities so we came

65
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:21,229
together and said how can we be more

66
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:24,050
impactful so we came together and form a

67
00:03:21,229 --> 00:03:27,560
virtual Center right so we call it the

68
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:30,530
plant power production and again with

69
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:32,180
NSF funding we were able to acquire this

70
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:35,270
instrument because we were really

71
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:39,230
looking for things that will empower and

72
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:43,219
do our go from the scripting science to

73
00:03:39,229 --> 00:03:45,829
quantitative science and go from a very

74
00:03:43,219 --> 00:03:48,139
very biased approach which is manual

75
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:50,090
phenotyping to an unbiased approach so

76
00:03:48,139 --> 00:03:53,959
this is the system we acquired in Tuscon

77
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:56,569
a larger HTS from Lemna tech it has four

78
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:59,120
cameras a visible camera a fluorescence

79
00:03:56,569 --> 00:04:02,930
camera an infrared camera and an

80
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:04,909
infrared camera and already talked all

81
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:07,069
those are some of the benefits of each

82
00:04:04,909 --> 00:04:09,469
of these sensors and what I want to

83
00:04:07,069 --> 00:04:11,989
bring to your attention is we can see no

84
00:04:09,469 --> 00:04:14,840
type Arabidopsis we can see no type also

85
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:17,480
the seedling stage of many crops in this

86
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:18,379
configuration and we also have a vector

87
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:21,859
accommodates

88
00:04:18,379 --> 00:04:24,050
place and route evil place so the

89
00:04:21,858 --> 00:04:27,978
downside of our system is very fast in

90
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:29,990
each space here so I cannot go beyond

91
00:04:27,978 --> 00:04:32,719
the before the

92
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:35,329
the state of of many crops so that's the

93
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:37,370
downside of the system we are ok so

94
00:04:35,329 --> 00:04:40,189
again a little bit more detail on the

95
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:43,759
camera the visible camera again the

96
00:04:40,189 --> 00:04:45,889
workhorse you can interrogate and get

97
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:47,990
information regarding size architecture

98
00:04:45,889 --> 00:04:49,969
and color it with the fluorescence

99
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:51,800
camera we can have an indication of

100
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:54,350
plant health through chlorophyll

101
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:56,120
fluorescence on with the special filters

102
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:58,240
you can measure fluorescent proteins or

103
00:04:56,120 --> 00:05:00,050
for example inhale roots that are

104
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:03,079
non-photosynthetic we can measure

105
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:04,699
technologies with the reinsurance camera

106
00:05:03,079 --> 00:05:07,639
we can get information regarding water

107
00:05:04,699 --> 00:05:10,909
content and with the infrared in this

108
00:05:07,639 --> 00:05:13,849
temperature ok so again why do we like

109
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:15,980
it some buyers non-destructive federal

110
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:18,500
phenotypes can be detected and this is

111
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:20,870
one of my favorites RAW images are

112
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:22,899
permanently store and you can come up

113
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:27,439
later with a different question and

114
00:05:22,899 --> 00:05:30,799
interrogate the data set now if careful

115
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:33,439
metadata is kept I think there is a lot

116
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:36,470
that can be gained by the overall

117
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:39,439
community if we deposit this data in

118
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:41,090
places where in public where Elena's and

119
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:44,000
interrogate my data I can intervene

120
00:05:41,089 --> 00:05:48,109
Chris and so on and so forth

121
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:51,079
so the throughput of our system is if we

122
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:54,439
do multi well place in the order of 8000

123
00:05:51,079 --> 00:05:56,719
samples per run and form or most of the

124
00:05:54,439 --> 00:05:59,810
assets we do with cleansing soil between

125
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:04,870
18 and 45 plants to run an around

126
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:04,870
usually takes less than an hour so I

127
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:09,950
love the system mostly because

128
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:11,990
experiments that before it took me 6

129
00:06:09,949 --> 00:06:16,430
months to get done now I get them done

130
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:19,160
in four weeks so site and also now I can

131
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:21,680
manage a lot higher number of samples

132
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:22,939
then the statistics and the robustness

133
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:27,379
of your variant groups

134
00:06:22,939 --> 00:06:31,129
ok so this is my current team half of

135
00:06:27,379 --> 00:06:35,079
the teams that vitamin C metabolism

136
00:06:31,129 --> 00:06:36,949
which is my passion I love plant and

137
00:06:35,079 --> 00:06:38,870
biochemistry of plants but the other

138
00:06:36,949 --> 00:06:40,909
half of my team really does in the

139
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:41,720
piping for me for what several

140
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:44,750
universities

141
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:48,110
misery and for all of the external users

142
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:51,350
were serving this is a very talented

143
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:53,350
postdoc dr. Susan you he's the one who

144
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:55,629
has developed all of the algorithms

145
00:06:53,350 --> 00:07:01,730
applications that I'm going to show you

146
00:06:55,629 --> 00:07:05,480
again very talented group of students so

147
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:09,670
the plant we have the most experience

148
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:12,290
with are are shown here and I'm gonna

149
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:14,090
Olin asked me to show an example with

150
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:18,220
our abilities and one with a real call

151
00:07:14,089 --> 00:07:18,219
someone will show rice today

152
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:25,880
so here my example so to show you what

153
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:27,259
we have got were one of the project we

154
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:29,959
have done in a libido space I'm gonna

155
00:07:27,259 --> 00:07:32,810
show you collaborate this project with

156
00:07:29,959 --> 00:07:34,699
the laboratory of dr. David Mendoza from

157
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:36,680
the University of missouri-columbia

158
00:07:34,699 --> 00:07:38,689
he's an eye on omics person is into

159
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:41,449
loving made out like Sarah love you here

160
00:07:38,689 --> 00:07:45,189
so he loves metals and understanding how

161
00:07:41,449 --> 00:07:49,729
metals are absorbing them transporter so

162
00:07:45,189 --> 00:07:52,129
what we have done in this article and in

163
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:55,460
this paper that we published recently is

164
00:07:52,129 --> 00:07:58,370
really do I anomic and phenomics in the

165
00:07:55,459 --> 00:07:59,870
same plant under water limitation

166
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:02,769
condition so basically here is

167
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:05,930
experiment we are germinate our

168
00:08:02,769 --> 00:08:08,240
abilities in place we select the robot

169
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:10,759
seedlings with transfer goes to soil one

170
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:13,310
way we have robot seedlings

171
00:08:10,759 --> 00:08:16,699
we divided them into four different arm

172
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:18,560
treatment groups and what a control

173
00:08:16,699 --> 00:08:21,680
group and three ones with water

174
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:24,199
limitation conditions and we say they

175
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:26,860
plan we're phenotype every other day

176
00:08:24,199 --> 00:08:31,789
of course we measure we make sure that

177
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:34,509
we are imposing water stress and in

178
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:37,519
addition to the phenotyping with the

179
00:08:34,509 --> 00:08:39,649
analyzers we are also incorporating this

180
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:42,918
beautiful instrument developed by David

181
00:08:39,649 --> 00:08:45,500
Kramer's laboratory and Michigan State

182
00:08:42,918 --> 00:08:46,779
is called multi specs q is a

183
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:48,559
non-destructive

184
00:08:46,779 --> 00:08:50,569
instrument that allows you to do the

185
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:54,179
same thing that a life for life but

186
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:58,000
instead of costing you $60,000 it goes

187
00:08:54,179 --> 00:08:59,979
so again what we like it is not its

188
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,929
non-destructive and we see great

189
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:03,430
correlation between what the data we are

190
00:09:01,929 --> 00:09:05,139
capturing this instrument and the

191
00:09:03,429 --> 00:09:07,239
fluorescence data we are getting with a

192
00:09:05,139 --> 00:09:11,370
scanner like that and of course the

193
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:14,259
economics person loves his icp-ms

194
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:16,899
okay so here a little bit of the images

195
00:09:14,259 --> 00:09:19,210
again control and three water stress

196
00:09:16,899 --> 00:09:22,360
conditions we're showing you the images

197
00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:23,860
and the analysed images these all of

198
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:26,440
these data set was analyzed with the

199
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:30,029
luminaries our software that we acquired

200
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:33,190
with the instrument and as you can see

201
00:09:30,029 --> 00:09:35,649
really the big changes in size of the

202
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:38,710
plant come on until you get to these

203
00:09:35,649 --> 00:09:40,840
levels of water limitation so here is

204
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:45,370
the big surprise for us

205
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:48,940
so with of this is be very resilient and

206
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:51,789
you can get down up to 50 percent water

207
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:54,580
and there is no penalty in the growth of

208
00:09:51,789 --> 00:09:56,529
the vegetative growth of the plant

209
00:09:54,580 --> 00:10:01,780
however look at what happens to sit

210
00:09:56,529 --> 00:10:05,199
below all I mean even at this level

211
00:10:01,779 --> 00:10:07,419
big big drop in in CD also what we found

212
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:10,570
out we fiddle is a lot more sensitive to

213
00:10:07,419 --> 00:10:13,659
water stress and vegetative growth so in

214
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:16,870
terms of the ergonomic what the beat

215
00:10:13,659 --> 00:10:19,360
found is that the effect of salt is very

216
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:24,009
element and very treatment in specific

217
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:28,810
and again I know cell of do metal lovers

218
00:10:24,009 --> 00:10:30,789
will bombard me with questions oh yes

219
00:10:28,809 --> 00:10:34,269
I just wanted to illustrate some of the

220
00:10:30,789 --> 00:10:36,039
power P okay so something that Lucy

221
00:10:34,269 --> 00:10:38,769
Acosta the PhD student that did this

222
00:10:36,039 --> 00:10:41,319
work knowledge is that although from the

223
00:10:38,769 --> 00:10:43,600
images from the top there was no

224
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:46,000
difference in leaf area between between

225
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:48,190
these two treatments she knows that

226
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,679
there were more leaves here and that

227
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:53,650
were dr. Lu developed for us this

228
00:10:50,679 --> 00:10:56,199
beautiful strategy to count little more

229
00:10:53,649 --> 00:10:58,689
effectively and indeed and we found that

230
00:10:56,200 --> 00:11:02,110
under control conditions there were more

231
00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:02,750
Leafs these modules for leaf counting

232
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:06,139
has been

233
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:10,039
added to plan CV and again that's again

234
00:11:06,139 --> 00:11:12,230
my I really encourage you to take

235
00:11:10,039 --> 00:11:14,779
advantage of these great resource you

236
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:16,430
can apply to images that you acquire

237
00:11:14,779 --> 00:11:19,250
with any system you don't have to

238
00:11:16,429 --> 00:11:22,729
necessarily take it with any particular

239
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:27,200
system with its really really flexible

240
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:30,370
really good ok so again I couldn't not

241
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:33,230
talk about the starving biosynthesis so

242
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:35,960
this is a molecule that is my big

243
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:39,050
passion I work on it for the last 14

244
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:40,490
years it turns out that plants have four

245
00:11:39,049 --> 00:11:43,039
different ways to get to that molecule

246
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:44,269
and I was very very fortunate to be part

247
00:11:43,039 --> 00:11:47,990
of the team that at Virginia Tech

248
00:11:44,269 --> 00:11:51,289
discover these pathways that start with

249
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:53,259
my inositol so since I moved to Arkansas

250
00:11:51,289 --> 00:11:55,669
State my students and I now have

251
00:11:53,259 --> 00:11:58,250
characterized at least one member of

252
00:11:55,669 --> 00:12:00,110
each one of these gene family and when

253
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:01,879
we overexpress them and here I'm showing

254
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:04,759
you what happens when we overexpress the

255
00:12:01,879 --> 00:12:07,970
first enzyme this happens to plant this

256
00:12:04,759 --> 00:12:09,889
one at the same chronological age grown

257
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:12,620
under the exact same conditions this is

258
00:12:09,889 --> 00:12:15,789
the highlight the high vitamin C one and

259
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:18,230
this is the one time so this is this

260
00:12:15,789 --> 00:12:20,269
looking for a way to quantify this

261
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:23,149
phenotype is what what means phenotyping

262
00:12:20,269 --> 00:12:28,338
I wanted to go from pretty pictures to

263
00:12:23,149 --> 00:12:33,500
okay tell me how much bigger ready okay

264
00:12:28,339 --> 00:12:35,960
so we at the beginning like all of you

265
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:38,750
with we did lots of manual phenotyping

266
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:41,389
and what we have done is now validated

267
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:45,589
that all of the manual phenotyping we

268
00:12:41,389 --> 00:12:48,199
did are was indeed correct but now we

269
00:12:45,589 --> 00:12:51,230
have new readouts of health that we

270
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:53,830
didn't have before so here I just want

271
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:56,420
to clarify this is the wild-type and

272
00:12:53,830 --> 00:13:00,500
this is the high vitamin C Line and I'm

273
00:12:56,419 --> 00:13:02,750
using as controls to two lines of that

274
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:05,960
of express a proton pyrophosphate laser

275
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:08,360
this line is very very famous and uses

276
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:12,940
control to this unknown

277
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:16,070
salt tolerance and also learned line so

278
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:18,440
as I told you color classification is

279
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:21,470
very powerful but we were sort of

280
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:23,630
limited with the lemon agrees approach

281
00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:26,240
because we were only able to distinguish

282
00:13:23,629 --> 00:13:28,039
green and yellow but not different tones

283
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:30,740
of green which is what we wanted to do

284
00:13:28,039 --> 00:13:33,110
so again dr. you develop a club ekko a

285
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:35,509
color classification approach that has

286
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:38,029
given us much better resolution in

287
00:13:35,509 --> 00:13:41,750
understanding so this is what happens to

288
00:13:38,029 --> 00:13:44,240
well that in response to solve and the

289
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:47,240
transgenic the highest score rates don't

290
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:50,210
show these yellow in phenotype sorry I

291
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:53,269
should clarify it is not noticeable with

292
00:13:50,210 --> 00:13:56,240
your naked eye okay so I'm going to

293
00:13:53,269 --> 00:13:59,210
switch now to right to show your next

294
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:04,279
annex an example with right so this is

295
00:13:59,210 --> 00:14:06,530
funded by the plant genome program and

296
00:14:04,279 --> 00:14:11,629
it's a collaboration with the University

297
00:14:06,529 --> 00:14:14,120
of nebraska-lincoln so they have we have

298
00:14:11,629 --> 00:14:17,629
looked together for novel sources of

299
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:19,909
salt tolerance in rice and my main

300
00:14:17,629 --> 00:14:21,889
collaborator is Harkema Valley and he

301
00:14:19,909 --> 00:14:24,049
has done all of the phenotyping at the

302
00:14:21,889 --> 00:14:26,389
pillar in a dirty pannikin initiation

303
00:14:24,049 --> 00:14:29,299
stages and I've done the one at the

304
00:14:26,389 --> 00:14:33,069
seedling stage so let me show you and

305
00:14:29,299 --> 00:14:37,370
this is I don't know if Susan Lee Cindy

306
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:39,320
in the audience this is very familiar to

307
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:42,230
you because it's the right diversity

308
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:44,150
panel that Susan might push and her

309
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:46,580
collaborators develop this has been a

310
00:14:44,149 --> 00:14:49,129
wonderful resource for us to find those

311
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:51,770
novel genes involving salt tolerance in

312
00:14:49,129 --> 00:14:53,600
rice and important an important problem

313
00:14:51,769 --> 00:14:55,399
in the world and in certainly in

314
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:59,980
Arkansas the main producer of rice in

315
00:14:55,399 --> 00:15:02,600
the US so the beauty of this is it has a

316
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:04,909
core group that represents or five

317
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:06,889
different two groups of rice and of

318
00:15:04,909 --> 00:15:08,360
course there is all of these genomic

319
00:15:06,889 --> 00:15:10,460
information that Susan and her group

320
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:13,450
have not had made available so

321
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:16,040
phenotyping this was an obvious choice

322
00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:18,700
we're going after

323
00:15:16,039 --> 00:15:21,009
tissue tolerance not after

324
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:24,160
exclusion as mode of action for soul

325
00:15:21,009 --> 00:15:26,409
tolerance and the very beautiful work

326
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:29,409
that High Command has done is he did all

327
00:15:26,409 --> 00:15:34,029
of the all of these working at the

328
00:15:29,409 --> 00:15:36,219
Australian accelerator again and develop

329
00:15:34,029 --> 00:15:39,189
a pipeline for the visible images and a

330
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:41,200
pipeline for the fluorescent images I

331
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:44,890
should emphasize for the fluorescence

332
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:48,160
images a very talented undergrad in his

333
00:15:44,889 --> 00:15:50,409
lab wrote this software that is also

334
00:15:48,159 --> 00:15:53,049
very powerful for analysis is called

335
00:15:50,409 --> 00:15:56,350
image harvest which will be against the

336
00:15:53,049 --> 00:15:58,779
cost in early of plan 3 so this is

337
00:15:56,350 --> 00:16:01,629
another approach of an open source

338
00:15:58,779 --> 00:16:04,539
software to analyze this type of images

339
00:16:01,629 --> 00:16:06,309
harkaman already has found candidate

340
00:16:04,539 --> 00:16:08,500
genes and it's already validating them

341
00:16:06,309 --> 00:16:10,929
and again this is this was at the

342
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:12,909
filling station here they come his

343
00:16:10,929 --> 00:16:15,189
publication let me show you a little bit

344
00:16:12,909 --> 00:16:20,019
what I have done at our console space in

345
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:22,480
my case with minority undergrad 14 of

346
00:16:20,019 --> 00:16:24,610
them knowing nothing about science they

347
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:26,440
have come to my lab for the summer and

348
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:28,779
they have generated publication quality

349
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:32,290
data I'm very proud of okay

350
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:32,889
so hard to Mouse and the seeds we clean

351
00:16:32,289 --> 00:16:35,409
them

352
00:16:32,889 --> 00:16:37,110
we germinate them once we have healthy

353
00:16:35,409 --> 00:16:39,069
seedlings we transfer them to this

354
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:41,470
hydroponic system this is just

355
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:43,629
calculated clay to provide support we

356
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:46,120
put this signal typing trace in these

357
00:16:43,629 --> 00:16:49,689
stuff and this is where we put Yoshida

358
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:52,870
solution as a control group and two

359
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:57,910
pseudo are and we set up an identical

360
00:16:52,870 --> 00:17:00,580
tray but with four so in the first

361
00:16:57,909 --> 00:17:02,469
experiment we did we this was our

362
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:04,059
control group and we were providing the

363
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:06,459
salt in three different steps that we

364
00:17:04,059 --> 00:17:08,319
were not seeing a robot's

365
00:17:06,459 --> 00:17:10,180
phenotypes so we went a little bit more

366
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:12,250
aggressive so in all of the day I'm

367
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:14,860
gonna show you this is the black line is

368
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:17,740
our control and we made the salt in

369
00:17:14,859 --> 00:17:21,990
three increments and phenotype during

370
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:24,819
the experiment so first let me show you

371
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:29,710
the result with unknown salt or land

372
00:17:24,819 --> 00:17:31,439
line this is the representative images

373
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:33,600
of the line through the

374
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:35,399
just with Yosi resolution and this is

375
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:39,658
what happened this is a really a

376
00:17:35,398 --> 00:17:43,349
salt-loving line our digital readouts

377
00:17:39,659 --> 00:17:47,159
completely are but what the images say

378
00:17:43,349 --> 00:17:51,719
and manual phenotyping also bugs what we

379
00:17:47,159 --> 00:17:53,730
saw with the salt alone this is an

380
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:56,250
example of a salt tolerant line again

381
00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:58,980
this line grew better than the control

382
00:17:56,250 --> 00:18:01,528
and this manual single typing with this

383
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:04,378
at the end of the experiment shoot will

384
00:18:01,528 --> 00:18:06,869
bust up these results and as you can

385
00:18:04,378 --> 00:18:11,189
imagine most of the lines were false

386
00:18:06,869 --> 00:18:14,699
sensitive where the treatment grew a lot

387
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:16,649
less than the control and again the

388
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:18,389
manual phenotyping fully bugs act and

389
00:18:16,648 --> 00:18:21,298
the interesting thing is that although

390
00:18:18,388 --> 00:18:22,918
your eyes cannot see it the instrument

391
00:18:21,298 --> 00:18:26,878
was able to tell us there was a lot more

392
00:18:22,919 --> 00:18:29,879
yellowing in the plants treated with in

393
00:18:26,878 --> 00:18:34,199
this case in the salt treatment versus

394
00:18:29,878 --> 00:18:39,028
the control okay so all I'm showing here

395
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:43,850
just a cup just up a group of the lines

396
00:18:39,028 --> 00:18:48,450
not all of them again this 14 students

397
00:18:43,849 --> 00:18:50,128
have allowed me to now phenotype 200 of

398
00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:51,990
the lines of the right diversity panel

399
00:18:50,128 --> 00:18:55,918
we have gone through the analysis of

400
00:18:51,990 --> 00:19:00,240
84,000 images as Todd was saying very

401
00:18:55,919 --> 00:19:02,610
big datasets you need to develop a

402
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:06,720
different set of skills to handle that

403
00:19:02,609 --> 00:19:09,689
amount of data and I just want to finish

404
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:13,048
telling you that we are a core facility

405
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:14,399
we accept new users and whether you

406
00:19:13,048 --> 00:19:16,019
already have the money to do the

407
00:19:14,398 --> 00:19:17,758
experiment are thinking about getting

408
00:19:16,019 --> 00:19:20,730
the money to do the experiment we are

409
00:19:17,759 --> 00:19:21,149
we're happy to talk to you and to help

410
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:23,190
you

411
00:19:21,148 --> 00:19:26,369
we are resource for the planet science

412
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:27,080
community and we hope you find this

413
00:19:26,369 --> 00:19:30,538
useful

414
00:19:27,079 --> 00:19:32,788
my colleague dr. John Trent I want me to

415
00:19:30,538 --> 00:19:34,859
tell you that he has this beautiful PET

416
00:19:32,788 --> 00:19:38,128
imaging system at Washington University

417
00:19:34,859 --> 00:19:42,178
of San Luis is an incredible scientist

418
00:19:38,128 --> 00:19:43,889
he developed heat maybe from his own is

419
00:19:42,179 --> 00:19:45,630
really really amazing and

420
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:47,930
and Margaret already showed you the

421
00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:50,400
power of this Technic and I'm sure

422
00:19:47,930 --> 00:19:53,190
critical share some of the power of

423
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:56,640
these to me as a biochemist as a

424
00:19:53,190 --> 00:20:00,830
biochemist is just so amazing to see how

425
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:03,390
the carbon that was given in the leaves

426
00:20:00,829 --> 00:20:05,759
suddenly can be monitoring a life in a

427
00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:11,820
plenary still life right it's just like

428
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:13,500
mind-blowing okay so my clothing is like

429
00:20:11,819 --> 00:20:15,659
is this one I just want to tell you I

430
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:18,240
really believe there is the need for

431
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:21,240
more cooperation I'm very grateful to

432
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:22,859
the opportunity to be here I hope that

433
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:27,329
is a lot of opportunity for interaction

434
00:20:22,859 --> 00:20:28,859
collaboration etc and I encourage you to

435
00:20:27,329 --> 00:20:30,689
get very much involved in the North

436
00:20:28,859 --> 00:20:34,169
American plant in the Taiping Network

437
00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:37,410
this is a group of people that we are

438
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:39,720
always enthusiast about phenotyping and

439
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:41,850
about learning together and making of

440
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:43,710
these a more vibrant community in the

441
00:20:41,849 --> 00:20:45,539
United States so please contact me or

442
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:47,640
any of my colleagues involved on this

443
00:20:45,539 --> 00:20:49,230
and we that'll be very happy to take any

444
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:52,788
questions

445
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:52,788
[Applause]

446
00:20:54,519 --> 00:20:57,519
question

447
00:21:15,048 --> 00:21:28,710
and then I well we we really want um so

448
00:21:26,999 --> 00:21:32,009
this is our dream okay

449
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:34,528
our dream is or not

450
00:21:32,009 --> 00:21:36,599
long live Lima what are the goals of the

451
00:21:34,528 --> 00:21:39,359
Chilam imaging core social is to develop

452
00:21:36,599 --> 00:21:41,668
a database where we can all shoot the

453
00:21:39,359 --> 00:21:44,939
data but we want to have also the tool

454
00:21:41,669 --> 00:21:48,240
to allow people to analyze their data so

455
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:50,669
we really wanted to write things that

456
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:53,509
were compatible with plan TV again

457
00:21:50,669 --> 00:21:56,580
because we really think an open source

458
00:21:53,509 --> 00:22:00,960
software will be a much easier way to

459
00:21:56,579 --> 00:22:05,808
handle things so you might both of

460
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:08,249
growth completely a new algorithm yes

461
00:22:05,808 --> 00:22:10,849
the sense of are the same the images

462
00:22:08,249 --> 00:22:10,850
were the exact same

463
00:22:18,819 --> 00:22:29,779
thank you this has been a production of
